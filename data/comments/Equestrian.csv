Equestrian,3e3ule,REMAIN_IN_LIGHT,4,Tue Jul 21 19:19:21 2015 UTC,I really like the cresting wave horse! And her work isn't that expensive. Thank you for showing this!
Equestrian,3e3ule,CrimNI103,2,Tue Jul 21 19:32:29 2015 UTC,I agree! It reminds me of the scene in The Last Unicorn movie when the unicorns appear out of the ocean wave crests.
Equestrian,3e4tkk,Madiline,4,Tue Jul 21 23:30:32 2015 UTC,"I'm vegan, but since I've been riding my whole life, I think I perceive horse owning and riding differently from other vegans (I've gotten into discussions with other vegans before, but I don't know the general vegan community's outlook on it).  Personally, I think that owning and riding horses is not wrong at all. Horses live happier and longer lives when they're owned by people, and horses have been domesticated for thousands of years so it isn't as if we're removing them from their natural habitat by owning them. Also, I think riding a horse is usually great for them as long as the rider isn't harsh- I know my horse loves being ridden, and she's a lot happier than when she was just a pasture horse. In terms of tack- I know most vegans who ride try to stay away from leather products and other things, but I personally just stick with using them because it's impossibe to find vegan tack and riding boots and all that.  There are many things about the equine world I don't like, but overall I love the equine community because we all respect each other for our love of horses and we all understand each other's craziness. My opinion on how other vegans (especially those with no experience with horses) view owning and riding horses would probably be that I think they may not understand enough about horses to make a judgement on it, but if they do inform themselves on the subject, then they have a right to their own opinion. I know a lot of vegans are strongly against it, but a lot of vegans either don't mind or are okay with it too."
Equestrian,3e4tkk,poetoflove,1 point,Wed Jul 22 01:56:08 2015 UTC,"A lot of vegans are opposed to it, however I'm a new vegan and a horseback rider and I plan to continue riding. I won't be changing my tack to synthetic or anything, since my saddle is custom fit to my horse so it's in his best interest to keep it that way.   My understanding is that most vegans are opposed to the exploitation and harmful training practices that happen, especially at the professional level. Some may be completely opposed to anyone riding a horse for whatever reason. Vegans can be very diverse in their standpoints about specific topics, so you may hear different thoughts from other vegans.   As a vegan I see some standard practices in the horse world differently,  and I think its made me a better rider because I'm listening to my horse more than I have in the past.  And being vegan has positively impacted my life in many other ways! I'm happy to expand on that if anyone is interested. :)"
Equestrian,3e4tkk,reginald_q_wallabee,1 point,Wed Jul 22 02:45:27 2015 UTC,"Question: Do they treat it basically as going against a horses wild nature? How do they perceive it? I've honestly never thought about vegans not having pets, but I know they don't like zoos so I suppose it's inline with their thought system."
Equestrian,3e4tkk,happinessfilled,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:43:57 2015 UTC,"I'm a new vegan, but I'll try to answer. The main goal of veganism is to minimize the suffering of animals wherever reasonably possible. There's a wide spectrum of viewpoints within veganism so some people may oppose horses being owned by humans at all, however I think most vegans would understand that's just not possible/reasonable. Many vegans would probably be concerned that riding them is not natural and can be harmful. However as a vegan horseback rider myself I see the benefit in riding (exercising my horse both mentally and physically, as well as spiritual and calming benefits) that most vegans who are not horse people would probably not understand or agree with. Hope that helps!"
Equestrian,3e4tkk,reginald_q_wallabee,1 point,Wed Jul 22 02:55:15 2015 UTC,"It does help! It's just interesting to think about people disagreeing with it completely after all the time I've spent in my life taking care of horses. I mean, for me, I know my vet would be very upset with me if my horse wasn't being ridden and kept exercised due of her age. She's getting older and riding her, even just for 30 minutes trotting, has helped her maintain muscle and stamina. She's been a happier and healthier mare when she gets regular exercise. Besides that, my horses hooves are awful and I don't know how she would make it without thrush medication regularly. As far as some people go, I'm pretty Spartan with injections and fancy supplements. Horses stay pretty healthy on their own if you're careful, I just like to think I give her some upgrades with regular brushing and hoof care."
Equestrian,3e4tkk,happinessfilled,1 point,Wed Jul 22 03:30:30 2015 UTC,"I personally only know one vegan who rides, the only thing that stands out with her is how far out of her way she will go to purchase non-leather tack and apparel. Synthetic all the way. Off hand I believe the only piece of leather that touches that horse is his halter because that's safest, but even there she did nylon with the breakaway crown and not the full halter in it.  She's pretty easy going about it all, not preachy like the non-equestrian vegans I know or read about. The care and training of her horse is right in line with all us meat eating savages.  All moral equestrians keep the welfare of the horse first and foremost, even if the horses are living the life of luxury in unnatural stalls, paddocks, and riding rings. The 'crazy' vegan stance that we are destroying them by using them for work or sport is absolutely ludicrous in my opinion. Horses in a job they love are some of the happiest creatures I have ever seen.  Many vegans simply take things too far. It's like religious extremism. If you are trying to impose your lifestyle on other people, feeding your historically carnivorous pets (horses are a no go but a dog is ok? Makes no sense) a vegan diet, etc then I think it's just totally off the deep end. But if it's what you personally want to do and you are willing to let other people have their personal choices too, then I think it's fine. But people shouldn't condemn things they don't understand, and most non-equestrians don't understand horses."
Equestrian,3e00fy,Kalypso989,3,Mon Jul 20 22:20:10 2015 UTC,"I would wait and see if this is a problem you see over the next couple days. If the pattern persists, and you can't find any obvious cause, I would get a vet involved. There are conditions that can manifest from a tightened girth, and your description of walking ""like she's drunk"" is a little concerning; there's walking to ""protect"" an area, and then there's a lack of coordination called ""ataxia"" that is the sign of a greater issue.   I once worked with a mare that was intermittently ataxic under tack only, especially on hills. She eventually had a seizure or something when the girth was tightened on her and went down. I feel she had done neurological condition, unfortunately her owners didn't want to invest in the vet costs and retired her as a broodmare (great idea for a horse with a possible defect, right?).   It might be, as other people have pointed out, her trying to avoid some discomfort such as a big bite out girth sore. It may be something more. If it happens again I would do some function tests with her tack on, such as walk her down a hill and have someone try to pull her haunches to the side by pulling her tail. If she really seems ""drunk"", like she doesn't quite know what all her body is doing, I would definitely involve a vet. If she's protecting a hurt spot she should put her safety first and still seem quite coordinated. If she really can't control herself, it's a safety issue for both of you and you need a professional asap."
Equestrian,3e00fy,calm_chowder,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:10:29 2015 UTC,Ataxia was my first alarm that went off in my head when I saw her walking yesterday. I am waiting to hear back from the barn owner when she tacks up Illusion and see if she sees anything I couldn't. I am hoping that it's not neurological due to the idea of her only crossing her legs when she's got a girth on - not when the saddle is off or just resting on her back. Fingers are crossed that the vet does not need to be involved.
Equestrian,3e00fy,AtomicPenny,4,Tue Jul 21 12:16:04 2015 UTC,"If it was only today, her health is good, and all tack has been the same and is well fitting, my guess is that there was a bugbite or some other irritation.  Given that whole girth area something like that could go easily missed because you are doing most of it by feel. A rashy spot, scratch,  or flatter hives would be more difficult to detect than a large horsefly welt or whatnot. My gelding is real thin skinned and gets hives and sometimes I only spot the little ones because his hair will lay a bit puckered over it, but the hive itself feels like tiny braille and I didn't even notice it the first time over.  I would just verify my girth is spotless and really wipe down the horse well and give it actry again in a day or two.  If it was persistent a different approach may be best, but the random flukes tend come and go and have a simpler cause."
Equestrian,3e00fy,MarinusRising,3,Tue Jul 21 01:11:26 2015 UTC,"I'm waiting to hear back from the barn manager on how she did this morning when she was tacked up. Maybe she can see something I didn't. I wipe down my tack after every ride, and thoroughly looked it over when I was messing around with her yesterday. I really hope it could just be hives, or a bite I can't see (or feel) and it's what's bothering her. It's so strange that it just occurred and only happens with a girth. That makes me hopeful it's not neurological because she is perfectly fine with the saddle just sitting on her."
Equestrian,3e00fy,blackxanther,3,Tue Jul 21 12:07:29 2015 UTC,"Do you use a martingale? Sometimes if it gets caught in the ""armpit"" area it can pinch the skin bunched up there, which can be uncomfortable."
Equestrian,3e00fy,blackxanther,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:58:58 2015 UTC,"No, no martingale. I used to when she was younger because she liked to toss her head up like a giraffe and snag at the bit. Not anymore, though."

Equestrian,3e00fy,NeverendingStarchild,2,Tue Jul 21 04:46:17 2015 UTC,Could you go into detail a bit about what your horse was doing and why you came to the conclusion to switch girths? Any detail is much appreciated. :)

Equestrian,3dy5uh,shmee256,3,Mon Jul 20 14:55:49 2015 UTC,"24-hour non-drowsy Zyrtec here! I pop one before heading out and again before I hop in the shower to get all their dander and dust off me.  Allergic to horses, hay, dust, pollen, cats, dogs....I just deal with it.  Gloves, and strip off as much of the tainted clothing at the front door or car as possible so my tracking it around is somewhat under control.  Hay days and show days I am usually popping more drugs and still dealing with puffy eyes no matter what,  but normal barn days are manageable.   As a kid when my parents found out my allergies the doc said, ""You can take away everything she loves or just let her cope."" Clearly ended up with the latter haha"
Equestrian,3dy5uh,AtomicPenny,2,Tue Jul 21 01:20:36 2015 UTC,"I've been riding horses all of my life, so I was quite surprised when my allergy test came back positive for horse dander. I don't seem to have any symptoms around them, so maybe my immune system has desensitized itself from being around them all the time.   For my other allergies I take a zyrtec tablet daily. You can find more than a year's supply of the generic brand at Sam's Club or Costco for about $15.   I also suggest starting immunotherapy shots. It's quite a pain to build up to your maintenance dose because you have to visit your doctor to get injected weekly for a year. However, the dramatic difference I've noticed with my allergies was worth it to me.   Also, try to stay away from other irritants while you are at the barn, such as hay and dusty shavings -- your body will be sensitive to any sort of irritant once the horse dander starts affecting you. I've known some who have to wear a dust mask when doing barn chores to prevent them from exposing themselves."

Equestrian,3dy5uh,kittenpyjamas,2,Mon Jul 20 22:51:24 2015 UTC,"Gloves would be a good place to start. As well as handy dandy riding gear they also prevent your hands from coming into contact with allergens which you might then transfer to your face. As well as allergy med suggestions (which are all great, you could also consider doubling up two different kinds of antihistamine like citerazine and desloratadine), I would jump in the shower the moment you get home. As much as it sucks, try to avoid doing things like mucking out and tacking up or grooming, which will flare your allergies considerably. Also try to make sure you ride outside if at all possible, less stuffy than in an indoor arena. Obviously shit still happens. I was standing outside the arena with the horse I was about to ride and he rubbed his salivay muzzle up my arm which resulted in a beautiful area of hives. It's tricky, I'll give you that."

Depending on where you are located, it might be very high allergies right now. Also it can be the fly spray they use (they use marigolds in some).  The thing that saves him is Claritin, the Flonase (horribly misspelled), and a Netti Pot. In addition, drink extra water. A bottle before you go, during, and then after. Water helps a lot! Wear gloves including during brushing and just generally around them.  You don't need to give it up, just armor up!"

As another commenter mentioned, it's often less cruel than what many unwanted horses are put through."
Equestrian,3dvaeq,IllManTheFlashlight,27,Sun Jul 19 23:12:23 2015 UTC,"IMO: Humane, regulated horse slaughter is desperately needed in the USA to provide an alternative to for people who cannot afford to care for their horse a (a whole other discussion) and turn them loose to starve.  People freak out at horse slaughter for many reasons (humane factor, horses are more sentient than ____ (Bull shit), etc.).  However, I would definitely eat horse, but I wouldn't eat a horse I knew.

Equestrian,3dvaeq,shylowheniwasyoung,13,Sun Jul 19 22:48:07 2015 UTC,"Slaughterhouses are simply a bandaid to the problem. The real problem is breed registries need to become more involved rather than ""send us a record of breeding and a check and you've got a registered foal!"" In europe, there are standards and rules in place (cutting way down on the inbreeding) for a horse to qualify as a registered xyz. Personality, conformation, size and sometimes color are all analyzed so you only breed horses with a high probability of success."

A big problem is most pet horses are given non-FDA-acceptable chemicals throughout their lifetime as a ""pet,"" so most of them can't be eaten by people. (Not sure how that affects pet food manufacturing.) Horses for people consumption would need to be purpose-raised, and that kind of defeats the ""Backyard Dobbin got old/crippled so we are sending him to the knacker"" business.   If it was on a plate, I can't hurt it anymore than what already happened, so I might as well try it once. I say that, but I had the same issue trying frog and various bugs for the sake of adventure, and could not get past knowing what it was affecting how I liked it.

Equestrian,3dvaeq,Puddock,2,Mon Jul 20 08:29:15 2015 UTC,"Agreed. I think it does start with breeding though. There should be fines imposed on backyard breeders and tighter restrictions on breeding in general that should probably stem from the government. You should have to be issued a license in order to breed and if it is found out that you bred without a licence you should be subject to fines, multiple repeaters should have all breeding stock seized. In order to get a license you should have to attend classes given by certified trainers or experts on how to breed, why to breed, how to take care of stallions and mares, how to raise babies correctly. These classes should not be cheap, it's not cheap to breed, so why should it be cheap to become a breeder. Inquiries into individual's breeding practices should be taken seriously and if a report is made that they are violating aspect of their training, they should be subject to a review board.   Sorry, that's just my long opinion. I think the same of cats and dogs as well. All animals that are overpopulated and under homed. Whereas animals like cows should not be subject to these rules and regulations, because well, we eat cows, they aren't recreation or sport, they aren't a luxury, their primary purpose is food."
Equestrian,3dvaeq,mrflossin,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:39:06 2015 UTC,"Yup.

I'm a pre-vet student and in one of our animal science classes our professor brought up that he'd been on a business trip and ate horse while overseas. There was an immediate atmosphere change, you could feel half of the lecture hall simmering. I think that I personally would stay away from it, based on where I am now in life. I definitely understand it as a protein source for other countries. It makes sense to put so much meat to use. But I'm at a place in my life where horses are very important to me, particularly their health. I have the luxury of having more than enough protein available to me that I can avoid horses and not have to worry about the implications. I might try it some day, but I don't think I'll ever have a taste for it. I feel like this discussion is one very similar to one that might spawn from whether dog should be a food source, though I'm sure some people disagree with me. To each their own. As long as it's based on need and done humanely without any negative intentions I believe it's something I wouldn't wrinkle my nose at (horses that is). It's hard to talk like this because you immediately think about your horse. Would you eat them? Absolutely not! But your case isn't every case, if a horse is slaughtered regardless, shouldn't it be used?  I don't know, maybe I'm not being as articulate as I'd like to be. I think I can see both sides of this issue and understand them, but at the end of the day I just want us all to be respectful and understanding of each other and our planet and fellow animals."

I don't have a problem with horses being raised for meat, but on the other hand, I don't like the idea of an animal being trained to trust/depend on/work for humans being slaughtered (especially not if they have to be carted off in a scary, packed trailer to a filthy stockyard).  I would like it if all animals that we eat were mostly left to their own devices (living on a good chunk of pasture) and then killed in the most didn't-even-see-it-coming way possible.  I don't eat a lot of meat in general."
Equestrian,3dvaeq,Synaxis,3,Mon Jul 20 18:10:38 2015 UTC,"This is exactly how I feel too.  It feels like a betrayal to raise an animal to be a faithful companion and to benefit from that trust and partnership only to exploit that animal's service by sending it to slaughter afterward.  It's why I personally draw the line at eating dogs or cats (ETA: in America.  Raising cats and dogs for consumption in other cultures feels foreign to me but I only have a cultural objection to it, not a moral one).  Animals raised as livestock, however, I have less of a problem with.  I think an animal expressly produced for consumption, as long as it's raised with good animal husbandry and proper controls to ensure a humane slaughter, is just a part of life, and the reason that I continue to eat meat."
Equestrian,3dvaeq,Synaxis,16,Tue Jul 21 16:17:51 2015 UTC,"No, I wouldn't eat horse. It was this exact scandal you mentioned that caused me to evaluate my food choices and realize that:   I wouldn't eat horse There is no compelling difference between a horse and a cow or a dog and a pig By that logic, I shouldn't want to eat any animal,   So I went vegan."
Equestrian,3dvaeq,kolmek,7,Mon Jul 20 01:27:12 2015 UTC,"No, I wouldn't. I would probably not even be willing to eat at a place where it was on the menu. I wouldn't eat cat or dog, why would I eat horse?  I'm pretty sure if you even put a slab of horse meat on a plate in front of me I'd feel physically ill - I volunteer with a rescue that has pulled horses destined for slaughter and the barn where I lesson uses mostly rescues too. I don't think I'd be able to get over the invasive thoughts: That could have been Leo. That could have been Jess. That could have been Champ. That could have been Cooper. That could have been Justice. That could have been Tristan, and on and on and on. That could have been a lovely yearling culled from a shitty AQHA breeding program. That could have been a dutiful lesson horse who outlived his usefulness. That could have been a beloved pet sold to auction by family after the owner died. That could have been a lame standardbred dumped by the Amish that would have made a fine riding horse after two months of rest.  I don't like the idea of slaughterhouses as an easy way out. I'd much rather see a person euthanize a healthy horse that they've made every effort to sell or place than see it wind up in a shithole like New Holland and from there on a big truck to Canada. You get a horse, you plan for the long term and plan for emergencies and you make sure that at the absolute minimum you've got enough money in the bank for euthanasia and disposal. My opinion on that matter."
Equestrian,3dvaeq,tahlialouise,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:34:55 2015 UTC,Why do you think it is more humane to kill and burn/bury a horse's body than to kill it and use it for meat?
Equestrian,3dvaeq,kolmek,2,Mon Jul 20 18:20:37 2015 UTC,"Are you familiar with the process by which a horse is slaughtered in North America? There is nothing humane about that. Absolutely nothing.   Chemical euthanasia is a quick, efficient, low-stress procedure for the horse where they can be put down at home in familiar surroundings, surrounded by familiar people.  It's not about what happens to the body afterwards that gets me so much, although I'd personally never send a horse to a renderer no matter how it died. It's about the actual death itself, about the conditions the horse is put in both at its death and leading up to it."
Equestrian,3dvaeq,iambierdo,7,Mon Jul 20 18:43:54 2015 UTC,"Hello! I eat horse meat, and I breed them and sell their meat. They are grown in an organic way, feeded with pasturages and a bit of cereals when needed, and the colt stay with their mothers until the day they are sent to the slaughterhouse. That makes a tasty and healthy meat and I sell it directly to customer that know what it is. I often think these animals live a short life, but they live as ""real"" horses: they are born in meadows, they espent their lives in a natural way, in their herd, and one day they are ""hunted"" by a two leg predator. What is better: to live one year-15 months free and naturally, or 25 years in a jail-box with daily rides? BTW, I have two saddle mares and I won't eat them. They are young and I don't know what I will do when they are too old. I have them in pasturages, and when I can't ride them, they are with the livestock horses, and they look really happy!"
Equestrian,3dvaeq,missachlys,2,Mon Jul 20 07:21:16 2015 UTC,"Thanks for adding your experiences to the conversation.   Just out of curiosity, do you run a totally wild herd, or do they come in regularly for their feet to be trimmed/worming paste/teeth floated?   I suppose I should define that I mean ""wild herd"" as horses that are for the most part not used to human interaction."
Equestrian,3dvaeq,missachlys,2,Mon Jul 20 07:45:39 2015 UTC,"Well, it can be called ""guided wild life"": I move them from one meadow to other, I worm them with homeopathics in their drink water, I change the stallion so as he can't procreate with his own daughters, I give them hay when it snows.... There is human interaction, and some of them really love human contact, but their social behaviour and live is ""natural"": stallion protects and mantains the breed, same age colts game together, I have mares that had two daughters of diferent ages, and each of them has her colts... It's amazing!"

I have also eaten zebra that tastes amazing but is reaaaally expensive so I don't buy it normally, but wanted to try it once.   As far as eating a loved horse, I am actually going to take care of the meat from my own horse, and then cremate the rest (bones and non eatable parts) when it's his time to leave this earth. This way I truly know where the meat comes from and he can help me one last time by not letting me go hungry, as he did in life by not letting me be hungry for adventures ♥ It's the circle of life really."

As much as I love horses, they're livestock. I have no problem eating beef, pork, or chicken, so I don't really understand how anyone who enjoys any type of meat could sit there and draw the line at certain animals just because they have one as a pet.

I love saucisson so I sucked it right down. Afterwards, she asked me if liked it and I said it did. She then told me it was ""saucisson de cheval"" (saucisson made of horse rather than pork).

Equestrian,3dvaeq,Ephemeral_Halcyon,3,Mon Jul 20 01:18:35 2015 UTC,"I'm actually vegan, I think you need to be black or white on eating animals, you either are okay with it or you are not, but it's morally inconsistent to cherry pick between what's right and what's wrong to eat based upon love or emotional attachment alone. It's the old save a dear friend or save 10 strangers dilemma - there is a discord between what feels right and what is objectively right (as far as moral philosophy can be objective anyway).  Having said that, horses are currently commodities with no value beyond as companions or sports partners. Giving them value as food ensures a home, welfare standards, beneficial regulators and a humane death. Banning it just means they might be abandoned and left to a worse fate if they have no value as a companion or sports animal. Best case scenario really is that these animals are put down by responsible owners before that can happen, but that's not guarenteed.  I think anybody who gets hysterical about eating horses needs to put their morals where there mouths are. I grew up in the farming community and most of my friends (who think I'm ""an extremist"") feel as OP does, I see no issue with this as they have consistent views and treat their animals fairly and with respect. I only take issue when people get hysterical over stuff like this and don't care about factory farming or battery hens. I value consistency in my morality, I think it's key. There are a number of stances (animal welfarism, animal rights, and animals as commodities only) and people should have a think about where they stand before they get on their high horse about it."

I love trying out new/weird food, but I have to admit that while I definitely think that I should be able to eat horsemeat, it might be difficult to actually do. Kind of like when I tried out octopus, I just couldn't help thinking about how smart they are and started feeling bad, even though I know that it is hypocritical because I don't mind eating pig. But I will definitely try it out when I have the chance.  Interestingly, I remember right after the scandal horse meat sold out here in Denmark, because a lot of people wanted to try it. It's still not common to eat it here though, I've never seen it in a grocery store (or anywhere else) before for example, you have to go to a butcher."

I am a vegan, and I went vegan after the horse meat scandal in the UK. I had been riding for for 15 years at that point, and even when I was an omnivore, eating horse was something I wouldn't do. I couldn't find, logically, a compelling difference between the inherent value of a horse's life and a cow's life, so I stopped eating animal products all together.  As far as the migrant workers who are absolutely abused, being vegan and caring about those people are not mutually exclusive. I get a vast majority of my produce from my farm share, which treats their workers ethically and cultivates a relationship with the people they feed. Advocating for better food systems in both sustainability and ethics (which imo go hand-in-hand) is something we can all do."
Equestrian,3dvaeq,wbdane86,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:22:49 2015 UTC,I wouldn't but I think mostly because I have seen the horses at auctions that go for meat. They don't look healthy and well... I am picky about the meat we eat in our house and how it is raised.

However, working at a large farm has caused me to change my mind somewhat about the practice of horse slaughter. Some horses, I've realized (like humans) are just jerks, and would be better off humanely slaughtered and used for meat. But I still don't think I would even eat the asshole horses."

Equestrian,3dvaeq,IRaceBarrels,2,Sun Jul 19 22:50:21 2015 UTC,"The short answer is that, no I haven't (knowingly) and yes I would at bare minimum give it a fair go, either as a steak or a burger. The slightly longer version barring actual discussion and debate is that as horses, when they grow too old to be useful (or become to dangerous to be useful) have to be removed/killed. Most people prefer euthanasia, which is fine but can also be an expensive option. Horse slaughter for meat can prove to be more cheap, and much more efficient for the public good.  Now for the longer explanation. For context moving from here, I'm from the U.S. Last I did something that vaguely resembled research on this subject, which was roughly 2 years ago, horse slaughter in the U.S. was not strictly illegal. However, FDA funding for horse slaughter facilities simply did not exist, and the last 3 plants normally used for horse slaughter has been closed in the early 2000's. With no local facilities, horses bought off at auction for meat had to be shipped to Mexico or Canada, slaughtered and then shipped to a slowly diminishing horse meat market.   At that point in time the only regions that were actively and notably consuming/importing meat were the Eurozone and Japan. The EU had strict paperwork requirements needed for each individual horse that was sold for slaughter, or prexisitng documentation for the meat. Paperwork that was often lacking because of both the gray lines that are documentation needed to cross state lines is not the same level of documentation that the EU requires for horse slaughter.  That leaves Japan. However, this is where my research ends, as it turns out this was not going to be a particularly unbiased research topic for a 10 page paper, in which I would have had to prove to a bunch of college freshmen girls (freshwomen?) that horse slaughter isn't bad."
Equestrian,3dvaeq,TotesMessenger,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:30:15 2015 UTC,"I would if it was part of a cultural delicacy in a country or culture.

That makes a difference.  article 1  I prescribe to the ""if they're not lame, it's better to keep them moving"" camp- if you can trust him not to pivot and gallop around the paddock, keep him out as much as you can. He will walk slowly to graze/mosey and it will keep circulation up and fluid retention low.  I also believe that acute inflammation is good (the extra fluid carries ""rebuilding materials""), but chronic inflammation may need some help, lest you damage the surrounding tissue with constant pressure. Cooling poultice is the easiest to apply- Ice Tight or other brands with clay and menthol. You can smear it and forget it, or you can also paper/quilt/wrap it but the wrap needs to be removed after a max of 12 hours. Mild liniments such as Refreshmint also help circulation/cooling."
Equestrian,3duqee,carbonarbonoxide,3,Sun Jul 19 18:56:25 2015 UTC,"^ yes. The only thing I might add to the poultice thing, if your horse is the kind that always messes with stuff or scratches his legs with his head you may want to wrap his legs so he doesn't lip it and ingest a bunch. If it's pretty severe inflammation your vet may want to prescribe bute powder."

Basically, he tore a gluteeous muscle and during the recovery process of that, decided he was tired of behaving himself in turnout and went rodeo one day. The next day the leg was swollen, however the vet has assure me there is no tendon damage. The issue is isolated to just the tendon sheath."
Equestrian,3duqee,carbonarbonoxide,2,Sun Jul 19 21:14:10 2015 UTC,"I'm going to assume this means there is no lameness, and it's a bit of swelling, possibly from a bump or very mild tendon strain.  Call and ask your vet first, but sometimes I like to sweat a ""fat leg"" if there is no underlying injury. Here is an article on sweating, but the long and short is you are heating the leg and causing fluid to come out.  I put some epsom salt (because it is hygroscopic and will ""draw"" water), dexamethasone (a steroid) and a little DMSO (which draws things into the leg) into a cannister of nitrofurazone. Rub the mix into the leg, apply a layer of plastic wrap (loosely, really it's only there to help it sweat and to keep the furazone off your wraps), and apply a regular standing bandage. Leave it on no longer than 16 hours.  If you are at all nervous around chemicals, do not use the DMSO or Dex- a simple furazone sweat is perfectly fine.   If you DO use DMSO/Dex: SCRUB THE LEG TWICE, first with a surgical scrub such as povidone, and then with dish soap, make sure it rinses clean- anything on the leg, the DMSO will carry into the bloodstream, and I've seen horses (and even a vet!) get sick from alcohol used to clean an injection site, that DMSO carried to their liver."

For a baby, consistent and balanced riding are the keys to keep him sweet- if he overjumps and gets pulled in the mouth or something because you are also nervous, he might lose confidence.  FWIW, I usually have my trainer take my horse (showjumper) around a higher height for the first time, so I don't mess her up- even if we do great and school bigger at home.

I don't want to mess up his progress with my nervousness... While I would love for him to go this event, I wish I had the money for my trainer to take him as well.

I'd ride the schoolmaster, considering you've never evented before & also because it sounds like yr ottb needs a lot more confidence-building experience. all it takes is an afternoon to get the schoolmaster off-property (a local jumper show or xc schooling or even just a hack in the woods somewhere/at a different farm), so do that if you have the time."

This is an event, and I'm doing starter so it will all take place in one day.   I haven't personally schooled either of them on an actual XC course (!!!). Ugh. We have schooled at home everything that would be on a BN course except for the water. I've made him cross streams and big puddles, but a water complex is definitely different!  Greenie did fantastic with my trainer at jumper shows earlier this year, did GREAT with my friend at the horse's first event in beginner novice, then did terrible but completed his second event with her. The second event had WAY more atmosphere, and she took him without riding him until the event (I had been riding him, mostly flatting before this event), which I don't think was the wisest decision.   I do think the schoolmaster will be able to physically do the starter course. I just noticed how out of shape he was yesterday when I took him on a gallop and he was ready to poop out at the end of the set. But the set was much longer than the course time will be.   I agree. I am just so new to cross country.. I just want to be able to complete my first event. I would without a doubt take my greenie to a dressage or jumper show for practice, but I'm just very nervous about taking him to my very first event. It's not that he would do anything awful, its that like you said he needs more confidence (as do I). I don't think there is anything that I could take the schoolmaster to before the event besides taking him through the woods. I just hope he doesn't do anything unexpected..."
Equestrian,3dv4g9,fennecfox89,4,Mon Jul 20 00:06:29 2015 UTC,IMO take the schoolmaster. The young horse sounds like he lacks confidence and experience and would benefit greatly from several XC schoolings instead of a competition.

Equestrian,3dtb92,missbanana321,3,Sun Jul 19 17:22:34 2015 UTC,"I spent three weeks working on a riding safari in Kenya (offbeat safaris) and it is the perfect safari for an experienced, confident rider! It is expensive though as it is 'luxury' - you camp in tents with proper beds and big cooked meals. You need to be very capable as the ride leader is pretty insane with the things he does - we got charged by elephants due to getting too close, swam the horses across hippo and crocodile infested rivers, long long gallops over the plains, rode right past lions, jumped bushes and fallen logs, met the masaii mara tribes etc definitely not one to forget. The horses are mostly polo ponies and they are amazing, very fit and sharp. Bonus is at the beginning and end you can spend a day at their beautiful mansion lying by the pool and playing polo. The other place I visited was Wyoming, USA to try Western (I see you're from Australia, I'm from the UK) which was pretty fun, really beautiful but I wouldn't recommend the company I did it with as it was more aimed at beginners and I was keener to go a bit faster and do more, we did go on some nice trails and do a bit of barrel racing and rounding up the horses out on the ranch which was pretty fun. There must be other, better companies that do this. Being from Europe myself I would recommend maybe France or Italy for some beautiful mountain trails, if you go to Southern France you can trek through the mountains and visit all the Cathar castles which is great if you're interested in history, not as fast paced though. Guides will mostly speak English. I used to live in the area and knew a lot of people that did these tours, really beautiful landscape and will still be nice and hot in September. Not sure about other European countries but if you want hot weather in September stick to Southern European countries like France, Spain, Portugal, Italy etc"
Equestrian,3dtb92,missbanana321,4,Sun Jul 19 17:14:32 2015 UTC,"rode right past lions   I was looking on the website and noticed a picture of a rider very close to a lion. I'm sure the horses are desensitized to them but wouldn't the lions prey on them? I have no idea, so please excuse my ignorance. I'm just curious."
Equestrian,3dtb92,spud_simon_salem,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:10:25 2015 UTC,"The guides like to tell scare stories of lions jumping on the horses and leaving scratch marks and making jokes about who is on the slowest horse... but in reality they barely look at us, we walked past quite a few and they never appeared interested. In fact the lions are very wary of humans because the masai mara tribes are very aggressive towards them. If they hear the cattle bells they actually run away. The guides do carry guns though just in case. You are much more likely to have problems with elephants or buffalo."
Equestrian,3dtb92,missbanana321,3,Sun Jul 19 21:13:45 2015 UTC,"Wow. I would love to do a tour like that one day. I've officially made it my life goal.

Stunningly beautiful French landscapes and of course the food is glorious. Highly recommended.   If you are willing to put up with a colder climate, I also recommend riding tours in Iceland. The scenery is like nothing else and you will get to try the tölt. Both Ishestar and Eldhestar are reliable tour companies."
Equestrian,3ds7g3,maine95,6,Sat Jul 18 23:15:48 2015 UTC,"I'm a huge fan of redirective training- making it so that the thing they want to do (and you don't want them to) is much harder for them than just doing what you ask.   10m circles are great for this. If he wants to fling his head around and do a rushy trot instead of canter he gets to do it on a little tiny circle. Ask for the walk vocally and sit deep while he's trotting but try not to pull on his mouth too much- use an opening rein and outside leg to keep him on the circle and use your seat and voice to ask for the downward transition. As soon as he walks open back up onto a larger circle or the rail and then ask for the canter again. If he starts with the rushy trot again repeat your circling.  Do this ad infinitum until you get a nice, prompt canter transition.   Once you get the transition and a quality canter allow him to walk out on a loose rein with lots of neck scratches and ""good boy!""s.   I know you don't want to use a crop, but it's essential that you learn how to ride correctly with one and a good smack behind the leg when you ask for the canter may be the reinforcement of ""hey! she's serious"" this horse needs. He sounds a little disrespectful and sometimes a crop can help with that (even if he doesn't respect you right now- he may respect a crop).   Good luck!!"
Equestrian,3ds7g3,altf4life,4,Sat Jul 18 23:50:24 2015 UTC,"All of this. A 10 meter (or even better... a natural circle) will take care of the rushing. I currently ride a horse like this. He gets worried about the transitions and my aids were not on point. You cannot let him rush into it. You need to make a rushy trot unfun and difficult and the canter the easier thing to do. The small circles will help him rebalance and slow down in order to make the transition. I've also had great luck opening my reins a bit with that particular horse. With wider hands he tends to not hollow out and unbalance which is the start of the rushy trot issue.  Also, a quick bump on the rear with a dressage whip is not a cruel thing. Its a great tool for a reason. I barely have to touch a horse harder than a very light tap or a tiny wave out to get results."
Equestrian,3ds7g3,daydreams356,1 point,Sun Jul 19 00:41:51 2015 UTC,"Thanks! I've never heard of the natural circle before. We've started on a 20 meter circle and gradually gone smaller and smaller then back out again, but I'll try to find that natural circle next time."
Equestrian,3ds7g3,daydreams356,0,Sun Jul 19 06:06:24 2015 UTC,"I doubted it a lot, but I read his book and its actually done great things for my Arab. As a dressage rider, I've always thought ""bigger circles are easier"" but that just not the case. It is a bit easier on the joints to go bigger, but as a rebalancing tool the ""natural"" circle is pretty cool if done correctly."
Equestrian,3ds7g3,Zireff,1 point,Sun Jul 19 07:03:13 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the detailed advice! I will definitely try this on our next ride! You are definitely right in that he's not respecting me. Which is weird because he listens well at the walk/trot. Hopefully circling will resolve the issue! If not, I may just have to say he's too much horse for me until I get stronger/ more confident cantering."
Equestrian,3ds7g3,palinodial,0,Sun Jul 19 05:55:11 2015 UTC,"Agreed. A circle will also help with having the horse on the inside bend to pick up the correct lead. Getting the correct lead the first try will prevent having to transition back to a trot to pick up the correct lead all over again or attempting a flying lead change.  A crop is a good tool as well to make clear messages if you are comfortable with one, and as pointed out, a deep seat and vocal commands are important to include when transitioning."
Equestrian,3ds7g3,ellevt,2,Sun Jul 19 02:25:46 2015 UTC,"sounds like he may just be taking the mick and you're loosing your confidence.  First, I'd make sure you try not to rush yourself and him. Get a nice trot going then give him a half halt which is telling him that you're going to ask for something. Then sit, then give your aids. If he doesn't listen I'd consider using a stick, to make him listen. You may want to consider a long whip which can be easier to use without fumbling sometimes.  Second, you need to make sure you want to go. You need to be determined and then he will listen hopefully. This is probably why he's alright for your trainer as she doesn't take his nonsense.   You'll get there, but as you say yourself you're a beginner. Riding takes time and you'll get there in the end, it may be a combination of your confidence, lack of muscle, you're off balance, wrong aids, pony messing you around, pony being off balance and so on. :) Agree with the others about circles and things if you've got the time."
Equestrian,3ds7g3,juniwolf,3,Sun Jul 19 14:32:58 2015 UTC,"You shouldn't be ""furiously swinging"" your leg back. It's a subtle adjustment, your outside leg gently moves behind the girth and asks. You may find with some horses that keeping a little bit of inside leg on at the girth helps with the balance and therefore rushing.   MAKE SURE YOU ARE SITTING UP TALL. Many horses will not canter if you are leaning forward.    I think a few good whacks with a crop would probably sort him out. You can use an ""oh shit strap"" if you are worried about popping him in the mouth."
Equestrian,3ds7g3,NeverendingStarchild,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:01:04 2015 UTC,"When I get horses trying to trot through the transition, I immediately halt after they start rushing and do walk-halt or walk-halt-trot transitions over and over and over until they're between my aids."
Equestrian,3dsjmg,JaydeMay,11,Sun Jul 19 01:15:19 2015 UTC,"It's a tough thing to think about but she's probably a reasonable candidate for euthanasia. I'm sorry if that's too blunt but the first thing that occurred to me when you described her injury and her behavior change is that she sounds like a horse in pain.   There's no reason to risk your safety or the safety of the people around her and it doesn't sound like her quality of life is all that great. You've explored various appropriate jobs for her but even if you were to look for a companion job for her, you'd have to worry about her not attacking more people who come across her in the paddock. She doesn't sound like a happy horse and it doesn't sound like her attitude is man made. She was dealt a bad lot with her injury but it seems like she's been given every possible chance. If you rehomed her, I'd be concerned about what would happen to her down the line and whether the next folks would go the extra mile for her the way it sounds like you have.  It's very sad and certainly you don't have to pursue it, but I think it's what I would look into if I were in your shoes. These things happen and a humane passing is better than many other outcomes out there."
Equestrian,3dsjmg,RonRonner,1 point,Sun Jul 19 02:08:55 2015 UTC,"I have thought of that option,  I too think she is in pain.  One of the guys out there told me her leg was really swollen one day and she was having a hard time walking.  I am extremely attached to her,  but I don't want a horse around that is in pain and causing problems. We couldn't even give her shots today.   I just didn't know if it would be inhumane to go through with this option.  But giving it more thought has led me to believe she might be better off if I did.  It will be hard to do,  but best for this situation.  Thank you :)"
Equestrian,3dsjmg,RonRonner,2,Sun Jul 19 03:38:25 2015 UTC,I'm so sorry you find yourself in this situation but you sound like a very caring and empathetic horse person. Your mare is lucky to have been born into such a responsible and loving home.

Called a vet BECAUSE ""HER LEG WAS REALLY SWOLLEN ONE DAY AND SHE HAD A HARD TIME WALKING""?   Backyard breeding is so frustrating because what ends up happening is people owning horses that they don't know what to do with and then those horses end up at slaughter.  All of us horsepeople have been bit, kicked, trampled and had to deal with adversity that a horse has presented at some point in time. If you would rather just give up and kill your horse now then why make her suffer for 10 years?"

Equestrian,3dpq8k,carbonarbonoxide,4,Sat Jul 18 17:00:57 2015 UTC,"I haven't conditioned them to it in such a close proximity. They're in Podunkville so there is always shooting going on nearby, and our own target shooting on the property. So while it can startle them it rarely sets them off under usual circumstances.   That's obviously not nearly as loud and unexpected as 2' away from their head is though!  On the ground I am confident I could keep them from completely losing their mind and maintaining control of them. Under saddle....eh haha. I think if they were calm, and I were able to devote my full attention to sticking with the resulting firework I would be able to calm them down. But I don't think that would ever be a situation.   The one time I did shoot off the horse was to kill a dog that stalked and then tried to attack more than once. The horse was already pretty damn frazzled when I shot, but you can get the shot off before the horse realizes it's happening. I got my ass tossed off on that one! But with the dog no longer coming at him he forgot the gunshot quickly enough and was easily caught and remounted.  So long answer short lol, I would get off if I could but as long as the ground isn't totally jagged I would just fire and deal with whatever happens. Shots are loud as fuck, and I am not hunting with the horses where it would be hugely benificial to get them used to that. Heck, it startles me still sometimes if it's especially loud haha"

I normally lease Sox over the summer but finances are keeping me from continuing my full lease for the whole summer. ;(  but, I am working something this out so I can still get extra rides in outside of my lessons. But I've been riding him 4 times a week since may and its been amazing!  Speaking of lessons, I had a really awesome one today.  I have really been practicing a lot and working hard on my own to keep my shoulders back and my butt in saddle (and not perch on my toes or stand in the stirrups) while of course working on all the other things we work on while riding... And it's paid off. I haven't ridden a lesson in a few weeks but I've ridden 4 time a week every week and today my trainer was throwing out the compliments!  It felt really good to hear and to ride so well!  I have struggled with my canter (and posted here several times about it with great responses) but it finally really feels like it's coming together nicely. Trainer told me today that I should feel great because I looked great. My pony was being abnormally hot and with a lot of to goto but I able to keep him in line and listening.  And all of this recent improvement is helping my jumping too, which i have found that I really enjoy! And I don't naturally suck at it either! Which is surprising. I do not really have natural horse riding skills. I have a natural general athleticism but that's it. So, not sucking at jumping is pretty cool.  I can officially say I don't feel like a beginner anymore!  My trainer has been trying to tell me that I leveled up my riding skills but I guess I just didn't believe her. Every time we move into something new lately, she tells me I'm leveling up, Lol.   Anyway, thanks for all the help and encouragement. I just wanted to brag and share both my journey and my horse 🐎"

Equestrian,3dq6qz,CalculatedPi,13,Sat Jul 18 11:06:23 2015 UTC,"It's pretty difficult to predict past abuse from present flinchiness. Arabians are hot blooded, highly reactive horses with a strong flight instinct. They also still weigh 800-900 lbs with rocks for feet, so probably not the best opportunity to learn by doing.  I strongly agree with /u/AtomicPenny that you would really be doing best by this horse to find her a rescue that is experienced and qualified enough to take her in. Rearing is a very dangerous habit and can absolutely, no joke kill you if she also picks up the lovely habit of striking out while she does so. I've had a horse purposely aim for me (that fucker, although he had a painful medical condition that half explains it) and I was lucky that he only went for my arm and not my head. Head = dead. We're far enough away from old timey eras where horses were a part of our daily lives but people were pretty routinely killed by kicks. They are lovely, docile animals but they come with a steep learning curve.  TL;DR: You'll be doing yourself and this horse a favor by helping put her in the hands of experienced handlers before you get yourself really hurt."
Equestrian,3dq6qz,RonRonner,25,Sat Jul 18 12:44:18 2015 UTC,"I am instantly wary when someone uses the word ""bond"" as if it's a mythical presence that somehow makes everything work out. No everlasting love and deep understanding is going to appear because you throw them hay and check to make sure they didn't gravely wound themselves in the paddock that day. It just doesn't work like that.  Get rid of the horse or get yourself a trainer before you get hurt."
Equestrian,3dq6qz,AtomicPenny,6,Sat Jul 18 11:18:08 2015 UTC,"There's so many people who attach way too much importance to the mythical magical powerful bond between horse and rider. I can't count how many people have come back to me after riding their horse shocked that they were thrown asking why their horse would do that when they're so bonded. Or placing too much trust in the kindness of horses. Fact is, horses are prey animals, they will dump you, run you over, rear and lash out, etc. if they feel like they are being threatened, no bond will overcome that, proper training and exposure can help both horse and rider deal with the outcome, but that's all you can do."
Equestrian,3dq6qz,mrflossin,4,Sat Jul 18 18:14:09 2015 UTC,"Reminds me of something I saw as a kid. Was watching a friends lesson after mine, and I was seated with a few parents. Another kid gets dumped seemingly out of nowhere. Horse just spooked hard, bucked and bolted. After everything had calmed down, the parent asked the trainer why the horse did that. ""Did a bee get him!? Did something scare him!?"" And the trainer just shrugged and went ""Maybe. Maybe it was nothing. He's a horse. They'll do this.""   ""So it could have been nothing!?""  ""Yup. Like I said, he's a horse.""   Always stuck with me."
Equestrian,3dq6qz,royallyred,7,Sun Jul 19 00:24:49 2015 UTC,"The thing is, you need to not treat the horse like he was abused. No babying at all. That creates an unstable environment for the horse. Horses do not live in the past and she needs a leader now. You really are going to want to work with a trainer. Lack of skill and timing will create a dangerous horse. She already has issues and you need timing to know how to fix it. She is likely not abused. A lot of horse's are flinchy around their head and uneducated owners will just make the horse worse and worse. She has behavioral issues and thats all you need to know.   I also suggest you check out Warwick Schiller's video series. He has a huge youtube that is free and a subscription service on his website with over 300 thirty minute + long videos. The basics of most horse training revolves around pressure and release of pressure. Release of pressure is a reward for a horse. Pressure can be anything the horse is uncomfortable with such as being moved around or standing near a scary bag. As an example, lets say she gets tense anytime you put your hand near her face. You want to hold your hand there until she gives even the tiniest try of relaxation (such as dropping her head, licking her lips/ chewing, even blinking) and then release the pressure by removing the hand. You continue to build up until you get where you want. This works for almost any horse and I've never met one that could not be trained in this way. The biggest mistakes in this method are to not use a starting point (ex : chasing the horse with fly spray past the point she is already freaking out instead of starting far away when she starts to get uncomfortable and slowly getting closer in steps) and to use bad timing. You also need to be able to move the horse around using this method. Both their front and back end.  I want to also say that horses do not bond by getting food. Lets say she runs around freaking out and you feed her and leave. You just rewarded her spinning around and freaking out and will get a worse response. While there can truly be a built bond, its by proper training and mutual respect. As I said before, she needs a trainer. Rearing is deadly for you and will only get worse. Its one of the hardest things to get rid of and needs someone experienced in groundwork who is not afraid to move the horse's feet around and knows timing."
Equestrian,3dq6qz,daydreams356,2,Sat Jul 18 15:59:12 2015 UTC,A rearing horse will kill you. KILL YOU. You need to find a good rescue or send this girl off to a trainer like yesterday. If you want to learn how to be around horses you should find a trainer who can teach you on a quiet schoolie first.
Equestrian,3dq6qz,ellevt,2,Sun Jul 19 19:04:18 2015 UTC,"It's not a good combination to be a novice horseperson with a ""Needs Work"" horse.  At least one of you should be comfortable and confident about what you're doing and it sounds like that's not really the case at the moment.  One does not ""gain a horse's trust"" by feeding it.  Dispensing food is not how you 'build a bond' or whatever.  Forget all about mystical bonds.  Get a trainer.  That said, here are some short rules for working with horses...   Horses respect those that can make them move their feet.  A trainer can show you how to use your body language and halter/lead/dressage whip to most effectively communicate with your horse. Horses appreciate consistency and clarity -- these things relax them -- but what is clear to you is not clear to your horse.  You need to learn to ""speak horse"" and that's where having a trainer comes in... Horses do not like being uncertain about the hierarchy in their world -- they really like knowing who is in charge.  People get hurt if the horse is in charge, so ideally the person is in charge.  If you don't know how to be in charge of a horse, in ways that the horse understands, find someone to teach you.  These someones are called ""trainers"". Horses learn in the two-second window that follows any action.  If a horse needs correction, it needs to happen IMMEDIATELY after the Bad Thing, in that 2 second window.  Most novice horsepeople need to practice this skill, A LOT, with a trainer offering coaching from the sidelines. If you need to correct your horse, note that it is not helpful to ""correct""  for more than about two or three seconds.  A proper correction is short and all the way over when it's over.  You must allow the horse back into the Good Boy Box immediately after you're done correcting.  You are not allowed to ""stay mad"" or whatever.  Also, any correction that lasts more than two or three seconds is just Human Being Punitive and won't make the horse learn any faster/better.  In fact, it may go quite poorly for you if you go too far down the ""bigger, longer, badder correction"" road.  (Arabs are not ""punching bag"" horses.  If you get excessive about correcting, your horse may say Aw Hell No.  The arabs I've known are eminently trainable but they do not tolerate unfair or excessively rough treatment.  You may be quite firm when needed, but you ALSO have to be very quick and effective on your releases from pressure.  Most people, if they get ""quite firm"", then cannot release completely and totally.  The lack of release then causes the horse to explode.  I would not call an arab a ""beginner"" project horse and I own/ride/train them and am very fond indeed of the breed.)  A trainer can help you learn when to correct, how to correct, what an appropriate amount of correction looks like, and how to do all of this so that the horse can understand and learn from you. Horses need time to think and learn when you present new material.  A horse is thinking/learning when his lips move and he looks like he's chewing even though there is no food handy.  Your trainer will know what this looks like and can point it out to you so that you can tell when  your horse is processing"" new information.  Your trainer can also teach you about horse body language in general so that you can become a more effective horseperson and a better trainer of your own horse. Ten minutes on three different days is Way More Useful for horse learning than thirty minutes in one day.  Your trainer will know lots more about how horses learn, their body language, and their aptitudes.  Your trainer will instruct you about these things and help you develop the skills you'll need to go further. It is the human's job to set the horse up for success, to make it easy for the horse to Do the Right Thing.  Sometimes this is not obvious or easy for humans, particularly if they're not real experienced with horses.  An experienced horseperson, like a trainer, can help you learn to set the horse up for success.  This is why we are all sitting here on the internet telling you to Find A Trainer.   On the arab front:  I have arabs, ride arabs, break and train arabs.  They're tons of fun and quite clever.  They're also not the easiest things to learn on because they're kind of reactive and can be ""sudden"".  I would not suggest keeping this horse without the help of an experienced trainer whom you see at least 2x a week With The Horse for instruction."
Equestrian,3dq6qz,throwaway224,3,Mon Jul 20 17:51:46 2015 UTC,"I agree with the trainer suggestions, but the best way to get a horse to trust your intentions is by being deliberate, slow, CONSISTENT AND FAIR. In caps because it's the most important of those."
Equestrian,3dq6qz,carbonarbonoxide,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:03:29 2015 UTC,"It is true a trainer is probably your best bet, but if you are persistent on doing it yourself three things: ground work, ground work, and more ground work. I wouldn't even think about brushing or any of the lovey stuff. The horse needs a strong leader, I strongly agree with checking out warick shiller like daydreams365 had recommended."
Equestrian,3dq6qz,Eml337,0,Sun Jul 19 18:38:39 2015 UTC,"I have a horse that is similar to this.  I bought him a few months ago from a family.  He was skinny and hated being touched on the face and neck.  We had a hard time getting him in the trailer and the guy was very mean to him to get him in there.  He was haltered when we got there so I didn't have to fight that thankfully.  Anyway,  I got him home and he was calm and walked out nicely (or just happy to get out of the trailer after 3 hours) but when I went to go release the buckle to let him go,  he shied from me. I moved fast but gentle to make it less painful for him.  It took me 4 weeks to catch him,  playing with him little by little,  giving him treats, letting him walk to me to sniff me,  and eventually getting a halter on him.  Now,  he won't leave me alone,  he's usually the first to greet you at the gate with Nickers and kisses.  He's even gained weight so he doesn't look so sickly.  Still working on the feet and he doesn't always allow me to catch him,  but it's a lot better than before.  This worked for me,  but every horse is different.  Just try a few things and see what works best for you. And good luck!  Td/rl: horse was skiddish,  tried a method and it worked, hope it works for you or hope you find a method that does!"
Equestrian,3dq6qz,JaydeMay,0,Sun Jul 19 00:49:52 2015 UTC,"Learn some natural horsemanship skills, ground work ideas. Be patient with her. She's going to need a lot of ground work. Not reacting when she freaks out is the best thing you can do. It'll teach her she can't get away with it and that you also won't hurt her anymore."
Equestrian,3dq6qz,dunmorestriden,0,Sun Jul 19 06:04:21 2015 UTC,"The important thing to do when a horse rears is to not panic and move to this side so that when they come down they do not come down on top of you. If the horse suffered abuse/neglect, it is possible that the horse is head shy. Were you moving around the horse's head (like trying to halter or something) when the horse reared? If so, then I would keep a leather/breakaway halter on her at all times until she is comfortable with you putting your hands on her head. It will be too much of a trouble to train for haltering/bridling on your own without the horse understanding that you are not going to yank, pull, hit or do anything negative to the horse's face. Sometimes abused horses are worse in their stall because they are used to being cornered into the abuse so I would work in a round pen on joining up. When you get a horse to join up, you read its body language until and slowly approach until it is comfortable with being close to you. The horse will relax their jaw and then will follow you around. My explanation is much too simple but books/info on the subject of joining up is plentiful."
Equestrian,3dmf3o,Cee-Gee,5,Fri Jul 17 13:28:50 2015 UTC,Thanks for some fun ideas...   I found her horse's baby pictures on the breeder's website so I contacted them to see if we can get print worthy versions for her.   We are also making a carrot streamer to decorate inside the stall.
Equestrian,3dmf3o,RonRonner,5,Fri Jul 17 17:01:03 2015 UTC,"My god, I would melt into a puddle right then and there.  The baby picture idea is so, so sweet!  You guys are such good friends/sister in laws!"
Equestrian,3dmf3o,racehorsee,4,Fri Jul 17 17:41:12 2015 UTC,Make goodie bags with horse treats and maybe some small horse related things (a small face brush or some riding socks) and give them out to people who come!
Equestrian,3dmf3o,fffisk,2,Fri Jul 17 15:54:22 2015 UTC,"If any of you are crafty, you could try to make a sign for his stall. I would bake muffins and buy a bag of carrots for the horse as well."

Maybe you can get a nice sign for the stall that reads ""The Finally Horse"" or something equally creative."
Equestrian,3dnzd5,joeman1324,8,Fri Jul 17 20:42:30 2015 UTC,"In my area to self board at someones property it is anywhere between $100-$300/horse /month. Typical is $200. Honestly, if you are not a horse person I would be skeptical as it comes with a lot of drama and liability. Look into the livestock lien act or similar in your area so you know your rights and theirs. What do you do if they stop paying you? Or leave their horses on your property? These things happen. It could make you a bit of money but if you are just doing it as a favour, I would just be careful the types of people you are letting have run of your property."
Equestrian,3dnzd5,qwinz,3,Fri Jul 17 23:41:27 2015 UTC,"Dry stalls (facilities only; no feed, bedding, or labor) are often rented out for somewhere around 1/4 to 1/3 of the price of full board at the same facility. In regions where professional, full-service boarding is $500-1000, backyard boarding (few professional services like training, limited facilities like arenas and wash stalls) is often as low as $300 when horse care is provided. In my not-inexpensive region a dry stall at a high-end facility (e.g. one with 2 indoor arenas, 2 outdoor arenas, cross country course, trails, groomed turnouts, multiple full-time groundskeepers, etc.) is in the $300 ballpark. A small barn on 1.5 acres would be a fraction of that.  In less expensive parts of the country that number can get even lower. Self-care board still requires work from the property owner -- fences and barns must be maintained for horses to a higher standard than for goats (horses pretty much try to kill themselves any chance they get), utilities must be provided (water can be an issue in wintry weather, as can snow removal), waste must be managed (i.e. literally shit-tons of manure). Those things are typically the responsibility of the property owner/manager even when the boarder does the horse care.  I wouldn't expect this sort of an arrangement to generate enough income to be worth the potential headaches (collecting unpaid board, handling facilities emergencies, potentially even veterinary emergencies). But if you like having equine lawn ornaments and like the lady it might be worth it to you as a break-even or maybe make a few dollars sort of thing."
Equestrian,3dnzd5,deliciouslysaucy,4,Sat Jul 18 02:00:58 2015 UTC,"At that point I think you should look at it more like renting the land out than boarding.  Here are a few things that I look for when boarding a horse:   Feed horses day and night and feed supplements Blanketing in the winter Providing hay and feed Making sure horse doesn't kill themselves, if they do get injured noticing in a timely manner. Knowing when to call the vet if you cannot get there in time. Turning horses in and out of stall on a schedule.   Some barns do more, some do a little bit less, but in general you are not boarding unless you are taking care of the horse yourself.    Cost comes into play when you take into account the area.  I live in a rural Sourthwest Virginia and get away with paying 200 a month for the above services.  However, in more urban parts of the state, like the Washington DC area, the cheapest board I was able to find was 650 a month."

Equestrian,3dnzd5,NeverendingStarchild,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:45:32 2015 UTC,Ask her what she used to pay. Minis are less intimidating than full sized horses. Do you think she is a weirdo or good vibes? What happens if she fails to take after the animals and you end up stuck doing the work?
Equestrian,3dka62,NeverendingStarchild,5,Thu Jul 16 23:18:37 2015 UTC,Look into an Llc for yourself as a sole proprietor. This protects your personal assets should you get sued.

Equestrian,3d9ji5,fennecfox89,8,Tue Jul 14 15:56:35 2015 UTC,"If they aren't training your horse it shouldn't matter. I know it sounds harsh but I had my horse at the best barn around town and they took amazing care of him even though I couldn't stand watching the other boarders train and ride. What they do though is not really any of your business if it doesn't involve you. Just focus on your horse, know that you have the better way of training and make sure everything is good for her."
Equestrian,3d9ji5,dunmorestriden,2,Tue Jul 14 17:34:54 2015 UTC,"They won't be training her, I guess it's more of a feeling of not going to Wal-Mart because I disagree with their practices."
Equestrian,3d9ji5,desertedcities55,5,Tue Jul 14 18:12:35 2015 UTC,"I think everywhere you go there will be people whose training techniques are bad. If they're not touching your horse or outright abusing the horses, though, you gotta learn how to turn a blind eye. The place I keep my horse at has many riders like that and watching them makes me want to scream but I pretty much just smile and wave, so to speak.   Do what's best for your horse. She's not going to be affected from these other riders bad training."
Equestrian,3d9ji5,Barren23,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:33:31 2015 UTC,"Maybe keep looking?  I can't imagine being at another facility than the one we found.  Horses are treated properly, no harsh training techniques... but I bet it looks odd to people who've never seen some of their methods.  I've been wrapped in ace bandages and I've had my horse wrapped in them too.  We're probably super ""new age"" to many people.. with our myler mullen bits, no spurs, and horse first mentality.  I love that our dentist does her work with hand tools as well!  In looking for horses, I've seen a lot of stuff at ""training barns"" and high level shows that I'd call questionable training methods in regards to being safe and humane.  It's pretty sad, actually.... but our options are limited, usually a blind eye is what happens.  I choose to not do business with those people... not much else I can do unless I want to seriously stir up the pot, but even if you try, you likely won't get anywhere."
Equestrian,3d9ji5,Jellylamp,3,Tue Jul 14 20:12:11 2015 UTC,I'd go to the nice barn and turn a blind eye.  If they can be relied on to take care of your horse that is what is important.  Its also possible that they could see your good training methods and take note?
Equestrian,3d9ji5,NeverendingStarchild,3,Tue Jul 14 17:30:37 2015 UTC,"Does the place you're considering have dry lots and everything that you need for special needs horse? It would be unfortunate to board her somewhere where she is turned out on grass and then the sugars have a negative effect on the PSSM. Worst case scenario, would you be able to ride her if the PSSM flared up due to careless feeding by the caregivers? It sounds like you are confident in the one barn's ability to care for her dietary needs and have good rapport. I'm not too sure what bad western pleasure techniques are. I've heard rumors of tail breaking and keeping horses heads tied in various positions so they are so exhausted their heads hang low. What kind of training techniques have you concerned? Are these techniques cruel? I'm guilty of using jump training methods at home that would not be legal at a competition but by no means are they any more cruel than putting a pair of Doda boots on in my opinion. It would be more dangerous for a horse to plow through a jump and trip on the poles upon landing than it would be cruel to make situations that force the horse to become sharper."
Equestrian,3d9ji5,NeverendingStarchild,2,Tue Jul 14 17:48:04 2015 UTC,"Aha! Somebody that knows what PSSM is. I cross-posted on another forums and all I got were people freaking out about 4 cups of oil a day. Thankfully she is on the lower end of the spectrum, but I for sure feel paranoid about other people being in charge of feeding her and giving her all of her supplements. She absolutely has to have all of her oil and all of her supplements every day or she does become symptomatic. I prepackage things to make it easy for everybody, but still find myself counting how many packets have been used...   This barn is literally the only barn in the area that has a dry lot. My current barn doesn't even have a dry lot. I have to muzzle her, which is pretty miserable for her, and makes me feel pretty rotten when she sulks about it.   I think I have come to the conclusion that I am going to just have to turn a blind eye for now. They offer everything that I need, and I know are capable care givers. Mare did very well while she was there. Thankfully the area that I am moving to when I graduate has a much higher density of quality barns.   I have never heard of tail breaking in the pleasure world (for sure in the saddleseat world though), though tail numbing was a thing. It may still be a thing at the lower levels, but at the higher levels they check to make sure people don't do it. Trainers/Riders are now using weighted tail extensions to get the same look."
Equestrian,3d9ji5,blizzard07,1 point,Wed Jul 15 23:05:20 2015 UTC,"Let's feed the horses sweet feed and alfalfa with the expectation that they will never tie up or get strung out. And lets let kids drink drink soda and consume everything with high fructose corn syrup in it and expect them not get ADD symptoms or childhood diabetes to not be a thing [insert sarcasm, end rant]! Lol, yes, I get it. I think you have the best decision for your horse! Lots of us horse folks have to have a blind eye unless we are the owners and paying all the bills for the animal. It can get awkward but its the reality. I'm sure you're knowledge about equine nutrition if you've been dealing with PSSM for sometime but just wanted to send a friendly reminder about regular SandClear cycles - especially for horses on sandy/dry lots. Maybe you can find a quiet time to ride where there's not training rides happening. Out of sight, out of mind right?"
Equestrian,3d9ji5,SamanthaAshley,2,Thu Jul 16 20:00:12 2015 UTC,"I was in a similar situation but ultimately ended up moving my horse to the barn. She has been nothing but happy there, the owners take fantastic care of her, she's put on weight I never thought she would and has a great pasture buddy.  That being said I disagree with how every other owner trains their horse but I kind of have just adopted a ""nothing I can do about it"" attitude. There's someone there who has a yearling that's almost two and she's been WTC him daily. I just cringe thinking about his joints. Since I usually don't have to deal with it, it makes boarding there fine. I agree with the advice: Do what is best for your horse."

Equestrian,3d9q2i,trotto4,7,Tue Jul 14 16:30:03 2015 UTC,"I would just take the time and measure her. Do you have an english saddle you can use to measure with? You just run a fabric tape measure from the second-to-last hole on one billet, underneath her belly, and to the corresponding billet hole on the other side. However many inches that is is the girth size you want.   Info here: http://www.doversaddlery.com/how-to-select-a-girth/a/426/  I ride my mare in a girth with elastic on both sides, which I prefer, but which has a greater possibility of overtightening. It does give a little more wiggle room size-wise, though."
Equestrian,3d9q2i,sashasuperhero,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:43:52 2015 UTC,^ This. Worse comes to worse grab some yarn and cut it to the length from billet to billet and either take that with you to the tack shop or use a standard tape measure.
Equestrian,3d9q2i,GoldStarVaulter,2,Tue Jul 14 18:25:34 2015 UTC,My large pony wore a size 46 girth. If the 54 is huge I would get a 50.

Another thing to keep in mind is that if it has elastic on it, it will stretch and make the girth larger. I had a three year old 52inch girth with elastic that was pretty big (6th hole on each side). So I bought a new one in a 48, and it won't do up unless I use a girth extender to get it done up... Then I take the extender off."
Equestrian,3d9q2i,SamanthaAshley,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:45:02 2015 UTC,"I would see if there's girths around in various sizes you can try! My guy is a 46 in something and a 48 in others, and if we do the conversion to a dressage girth he would be a 26, but he's actually a 22. Fit depends on girth to girth too...are there elastics on both sides? just one? is it leather or synthetic? Does it have any give? Girths are crazy (annoyingly) complicated, try as many as you can :)"
Equestrian,3d9q2i,cornisgood13,1 point,Wed Jul 15 12:11:02 2015 UTC,Girth size will differ depending on the length of your billets also. Long billets  = shorter girth. You could just ballpark how many inches too long the current girth is and get one that many inches shorter.
Equestrian,3d9q2i,Sillvin,1 point,Wed Jul 15 15:13:23 2015 UTC,Are there other girths you can try at the barn to check size? That is what I did to figure out my girl needs a 54 when my 50 was obviously too short.

You didn't mention his breed or age but if he's not young, there could be something going on with hocks/stifle on the left side. A friend of mine has a 9 yr old TB that kept failing to get his left lead, and his right hock had gone arthritic- had injections, it cleared up."

Up to 4 or 5 (or 6 or 7 if you're dealing with a super slow maturing warmblood) they can get super wonky seemingly overnight. All of a sudden their balance is off while they relearn where their body and legs go, their stifle is now an inch higher on one side than it is the other, their front legs finally stopped growing out of the same hole and they've widened up, etc.  It's some weird shit."
Equestrian,3d7lqr,Msustarr,6,Thu Jul 16 19:31:59 2015 UTC,"My mare has always had a harder time picking up the right lead, and really the only thing that has made a huge difference almost right away was working her to the right first, so she doesn't think about the easy left lead. She however would rather pick up the left lead, and counter canter. I think working her to the right first finally got it through that she can't just canter. In addition to starting to the right for a long time,  I only give her 3 strides to pick up the lead I am asking for, (ask, give her a chance stride, ask her harder stride, I mean it stride) Then we stop and start over. I usually shut her down, back a step or two and start over. That way she is not trotting all strung out around the arena, confused and thinking this is okay. I also find asking her in a much smaller circle, or deep on a corner helps to drive it into her head which lead she needs to be on. And finally when I ask for her right lead it is very exaggerated, I hold the left, open wide to the right, (one handed, I shorten the reins and move my hand forward and to the right) push very hard with my left leg and take my right leg totally off her body, and kiss. If I didn't kiss she would start leg yielding/side passing kind of exaggerated. I hope I explained this well enough so you understand what I am trying to say."
Equestrian,3d7lqr,Msustarr,1 point,Tue Jul 14 13:57:31 2015 UTC,This makes complete sense!  He was also side passing instead of cantering. Im going to try to completely open him up on that side. I wouldnt be surprised if its me bc im very rusty and just getting back into riding
Equestrian,3d7lqr,AuntieChiChi,2,Tue Jul 14 15:23:14 2015 UTC,"I know for me, part of it was that my right leg is MUCH stronger than my left, so it was really easy for me to ask harder with my right leg. Good Luck!"

Equestrian,3d7lqr,_ataraxia,2,Tue Jul 14 16:21:49 2015 UTC,"This has been my problem, but going to the left.  I have had to strengthen my leg on that side.   Also, if my horse doesn't pick up the canter after a few strides and just does that crazy trot-run thing, I bring him back down to a trot or walk (whatever gait I started with) and ask again... Otherwise I'm effectively training him to keep doing it wrong, which I don't want. And when we get it right, he gets a big reward (big releases, pats, excited ""Good Boys "")  We're always training them so we want to be sure they are learning the right things!  Also, I know some horses are better at going into the canter from a trot than from a walk (and vice versa) so maybe work on getting the one transition (from trot to canter) really good and then start working on the other transition (walk to canter).    Good luck!"
Equestrian,3d7lqr,Sillvin,2,Tue Jul 14 17:52:37 2015 UTC,"is it only an issue with walk-canter transitions? when you do trot-canter transitions, is he equally responsive in both directions?"

Equestrian,3d7lqr,thevoodoothatyoudo,11,Tue Jul 14 03:57:10 2015 UTC,"i would leave the walk-canter transitions alone for a while. work on building better strength and flexibility in trot-canter transitions first. focus on bending in all three gaits. do lots of walk-trot-canter-trot-walk, just two or three strides at each gait before asking for the next transition. make sure he's sitting back and carrying himself properly, not leaning on the forehand.  really get on him about being consistently responsive, too. you should only have to ask once, not nag him for an entire lap around the arena before he decides to give in and do as he's told."
Equestrian,3d7lqr,wapatilly,2,Tue Jul 14 04:08:34 2015 UTC,"We can't really say without watching you but it sounds like you just need to keep practicing it and getting him stronger on the right. I would not even practice the left. Just practice the right. Keep practicing walk to canter, trot to canter, on the rail, off the rail. When you have it pretty consistent start practicing picking it up while traveling left - countercantering."

Equestrian,3d7lqr,KetoCraziness,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:35:43 2015 UTC,Leg yielding into the canter or haunches in to the canter can sometimes help. Is he picking up the wrong canter lead right away or is there a few steps of trot?
Equestrian,3d7lqr,dunmorestriden,1 point,Tue Jul 14 12:02:26 2015 UTC,Immediately a few steps of trot. He doesn't even pick up the wrong lead... He just wont attempt the right unless i really push for it.
Equestrian,3d4o1r,AnnaTrocity,3,Mon Jul 13 14:24:16 2015 UTC,Congrats!  That's one hell of a score!
Equestrian,3d4o1r,RonRonner,2,Mon Jul 13 19:59:56 2015 UTC,Congrats! That is a great score especially for your first ride at a level. What breed is your boy? He's a cutie!

Equestrian,3d4o1r,deliciouslysaucy,2,Mon Jul 13 19:38:30 2015 UTC,You should feel pretty proud of yourself too! Congrats!
Equestrian,3d6fxv,oopsimtired,10,Mon Jul 13 22:03:36 2015 UTC,"I think any situation which leaves you stressed and upset at the end of every lesson is not a good situation, no matter how skilled they are."
Equestrian,3d6fxv,misskinky,2,Mon Jul 13 22:25:25 2015 UTC,"Maybe I didn't explain it as well as I thought. I wouldn't say I was upset EVERY lesson, I had my good lessons and bad like any rider. But there were definitely more of the bad than previously, which I at first chalked up to my own frustration at my slow progress getting up to speed again. It was after I started riding in a different setting that I started feeling like maybe it wasn't just me, and that my barn may not be the best fit."
Equestrian,3d6fxv,misskinky,6,Mon Jul 13 22:31:27 2015 UTC,"I dunno. It sounds like your instincts are telling you the barn isn't the right fit and you're hoping that we will tell you to switch.  Which isn't a bad thing! I'll validate your feelings. If you feel like the barn was stressing you out, felt like she was yelling the whole lesson, felt like you weren't even able to canter (when clearly you are able to, as you found out)... then I think you're right. It's not the best fit."
Equestrian,3d6fxv,ginganija,1 point,Mon Jul 13 22:42:02 2015 UTC,I also agree. If you're instincts are telling you it isn't a good fit anymore then you should listen to them. What I always do when deciding something I'm unsure is I flip a coin and whatever the outcome is if I feel upset with it then I know thats the wrong way to go (maybe not super technical but it usually points me in the direction I want to go).
Equestrian,3d6fxv,misskinky,2,Tue Jul 14 01:35:02 2015 UTC,"Ha! That's my method except I phrase it differently.   Flip a coin. Not because the coin will determine the right answer, but because when the coin is in the air you'll notice which side you're hoping for it to land on."
Equestrian,3d6fxv,ginganija,1 point,Tue Jul 14 02:33:03 2015 UTC,yours is much more poetic
Equestrian,3d6fxv,IllManTheFlashlight,2,Tue Jul 14 21:50:55 2015 UTC,"Is there another stable nearby where you could take a lesson to compare?   Stress will definitely affect your riding negatively, and one of the most important qualities in a good instructor is to be able to help a rider feel confident and bring out their best, regardless of their level. It sounds like your instructor is not doing this. Sometimes riders and instructors don't click (or stop clicking) and that's okay. I'd try to find someone who can cater to your needs and goals a bit better."
Equestrian,3d6fxv,kryrinn,1 point,Mon Jul 13 22:39:13 2015 UTC,"I've started looking a bit into other nearby stables. Another part of the reason I'm reluctant to leave without fully thinking it through is that this barn was the only one I found in the area that seemed to fit when my old one had to move, and as an extremely busy engineering student I can't look too far away. There is one not too far away that seems more laid back that offers potential students the opportunity to watch a lesson before paying for one, which I'm considering."
Equestrian,3d6fxv,kryrinn,2,Mon Jul 13 22:53:45 2015 UTC,"It never hurts to pay for a one off anywhere else, just for comparisons sake.  I do a lot of those when I need to reevaluate where my training is going, and if I like what I'm doing (or for a couple of years, just drop out of lessons completely). Even if you can't afford to stay there forever, it should give you a better idea of what leaving and new instructors are like.  Also, at some point, your instructor may have you intimidated so that you really are riding worse.  Lastly, stirrups on a bareback pad are a very, very bad idea!"
Equestrian,3d6fxv,uncatalyzed,1 point,Mon Jul 13 23:13:28 2015 UTC,"That's what I'm beginning to think I should do, along with a couple of lessons at my current once I'm back in my hometown to try it out again after having the break; I'm wondering if she also may have been off her game due to stress from moving to the new barn.  Also, it wasn't actually a bareback pad, it did have structure, just mostly on the underside for the horses back, much less than I was used to (especially after having ridden mostly Western at the rescue). If this type of saddle has a name, I don't know what it is."
Equestrian,3d6fxv,uncatalyzed,1 point,Mon Jul 13 23:25:37 2015 UTC,A treeless saddle?
Equestrian,3d6fxv,royallyred,1 point,Mon Jul 13 23:26:24 2015 UTC,"Possible. It definitely had a bit more structure underneath than the treeless I've ridden in before, but not as much as a normal saddle. The top was fuzzy and looked like a bareback pad, thus how I described it. I actually thought it was a bareback pad until I picked it up and felt that it had more heft to it."
Equestrian,3d6fxv,carbonarbonoxide,2,Mon Jul 13 23:42:01 2015 UTC,"You're paying for a service from your trainer. If you're not getting what you want from it, you don't have to keep going. It's not cheating to try out other barns and other trainers.   If you are liking riding at the rescue, it's perfectly fine to keep doing that and take a break from lessons.   I am currently on a break myself. Riding stopped being fun for me, and just started to be another stressful obligation (just graduate from college, and was on my school's team), so I'm taking the summer off from serious riding and just volunteering at a therapeutic riding center. I'm probably not going to be as good of a rider when I start back up again, but I will be happier at least!"
Equestrian,3d6fxv,NeverendingStarchild,1 point,Mon Jul 13 23:34:02 2015 UTC,"Honestly, if I could just stay at the rescue I would. Unfortunately the rescue (where I am now) is about 6 hours from where I go to school, so that's not an option year-round. Even if the distance wasn't an issue, I don't have a lot of time to devote during classes, my one lesson a week is about all I can manage. My school does have an equestrian team but I went to one meeting and got a very drama-filled impression and didn't go again."
Equestrian,3d6fxv,wapatilly,1 point,Mon Jul 13 23:37:18 2015 UTC,"Oh, that's too bad.   I would suggest giving your college team another try! I know on my team, some girls were dramatic and stuff but solidly half of the girls just didn't participate in the drama and so it was really easy to just sit on the sidelines with popcorn and watch. Even if you decide that you don't like it, the girls there are a great resource in finding other barns and trainers that may not advertise!"
Equestrian,3d6fxv,Kittenponypoop,2,Mon Jul 13 23:46:04 2015 UTC,"A huge part of training is how you feel and get along with your trainer. I stayed with a trainer I used to ride with because she was awesome when I was younger, but same as you, after I took a break it became obvious our interests had changed and were no longer in line with each other. I changed trainers after a much older rider (who had known me and knew my riding/abilities since I was younger )told me flat out I needed to change trainers. (well that and a few other reasons but that was a big one.) That was the kick in the ass I needed to change trainers, so I did.   I improved so drastically in just a few months with my new trainer I think I put both of us in shock. It was just a matter of having a trainer I connected with (who also explained things way better) and having lessons were I was much more relaxed/focused on having fun. Your mindset alone will make a huge difference when it comes to lessons.  So when it comes down to it: ask yourself if you think this trainer is right for you. There's tons of trainers out there if this one doesn't work out. Some really are just focused on showing and unless you also are, it might be better to flip to a barn that's more relaxed/focused on low key/fun riding. If you want to show more, or think this trainer is worth the stress, then continue to ride at her place.  And it's not like you have to make a snap decision. You can choose at any time."
Equestrian,3d51wg,drink_your_tea,8,Mon Jul 13 16:10:45 2015 UTC,"My two cents: don't work so hard at turning your toes out straight. As long as your foot isn't pointing out, you should be fine. Personally my legs aren't built to be able to point my toes parallel to the horse, I'd be very uncomfortable.   Also try to point you toes up instead of pushing your heels down.   It'll all come together in due time, a lot of it is muscle memory and the more you ride the more you'll develop the necessary muscles.   But #1, just have fun and don't think too much! 😀"
Equestrian,3d51wg,CrazieKC,1 point,Mon Jul 13 16:31:01 2015 UTC,"Great, thank you so much for the insight! I tend to be an overthinker, and I don't want that to detract from the riding experience (and the possibility to get better just from doing, not from thinking). You bring up some great points - it's much appreciated!"
Equestrian,3d51wg,buckerupbuttercup,4,Mon Jul 13 16:44:48 2015 UTC,"For hunter/jumpers, you do want your weight to be in your heels.    On the ground, I like to use a stair or a ledge to stretch out the back of my leg, and use the ledge to push down into the heel. For me, getting the toe to point forward was a matter of different workouts (squats!) and stretches. What helped me the most was stretching out the hips. It turns out, from years of riding, my hips are incredibly tight - not only making it difficult to point my toes forward, but also pulling on muscles in my back. Stretching these muscles has been incredibly helpful.  On the horse, two-point! Focus on stretching your legs down and wrapping around your horse. Start with the hips, and feel it down into the balls of your feet. Find your balance to a point where you feel like someone could walk over and give you a shove, and you'd stay balanced.    The stronger you get, the easier this will be. Good luck!! :)"
Equestrian,3d51wg,buckerupbuttercup,2,Mon Jul 13 18:13:23 2015 UTC,"Gotcha, thank you! That's really good to know that for some disciplines, weight in the heel does matter.  I really appreciate your suggestions for how to work on this both on and off the horse - I definitely need to build up strength in general, and I'm grateful for the guidance. The way you're breaking it down (e.g., ""Find your balance to a point where you feel like someone could walk over and give you a shove, and you'd stay balanced"") help even a beginner like me figure out what you're saying in a way that makes sense for me, even without having a lot of experience.  I have to say, I'm so impressed across the board with how helpful this sub is - you're offering such great advice in such an accessible way. You all rock!!"

Equestrian,3d51wg,KittenVicious,1 point,Mon Jul 13 18:45:32 2015 UTC,"Could you list some of the workouts you do? I'm just getting back into my fitness and riding routine after having to take a break for a couple of months due to medical reasons, and now my heels are giving me troubles. I think I lost some muscles and flexibility. I've been doing stretches and I'm seeing some improvment, but adding some exercises to speed things up would be great."
Equestrian,3d51wg,KittenVicious,2,Wed Jul 15 11:54:04 2015 UTC,"When it comes to riding, I'm a big fan of pilates and yoga for general conditioning, especially if you're just beginning (or getting back) to incorporate gym workouts into your riding routine. You can make either as gentle or difficult as you would like depending on what you're comfortable with. I had an injury (back) a couple years ago, and the combo of pilates and yoga helped tremendously. Bonus, there's all sorts of videos on YouTube that you can follow at home (in your pajamas, if you'd like!).  For stretching, I use a lacrosse ball to stretch out my hip flexors. Heads up, it HURTS. But it's really effective. Here's a great link for examples: http://movement-as-medicine.com/4-hip-mobility-drills-to-improve-your-squat/. I know it specifies squats, but really, what is the posting trot if not a series of squats?   When it comes to weight lifting, I like squats and dead lifts specifically for riding. They help build up core and stabilize the whole body. And there are so many types of squats! As with any weight lifting, form needs to be correct to yield best results (and not get injured), and I try to get as much feedback as I can to make sure I'm not accidentally cheating anywhere.   Hope this helps!! Definitely check everything with your doctor first, and s/he might even be able to recommend you to someone who could tailor exercises specifically for you!"
Equestrian,3d51wg,carbonarbonoxide,8,Wed Jul 15 23:54:52 2015 UTC,"One of the best exercises you can do to strengthen your ankles is to 'write' the alphabet with your feet. In other words, sit down with your leg in front of you, holding your foot off the ground, then keeping your leg still move your foot/ankle to spell A, B, C, D, E etc., (add a, b, c, d, e etc. once you get to the point that you can easily make it through the capital letters)"
Equestrian,3d51wg,KittenVicious,2,Mon Jul 13 16:35:09 2015 UTC,"Thank you! I hadn't heard of this before. I'll definitely start doing this when I'm just, oh, browsing reddit or whatever - in fact, I'll start right now ;) I'm excited to know that there's things I can do out of the saddle to help address this!"
Equestrian,3d51wg,LizVet,3,Mon Jul 13 16:45:48 2015 UTC,"It's a trick I learned in ballet, then when I broke my tibia at the ankle joint, my physical therapist had me do the same thing! You can make it more challenging by putting 1lb ankle weights around your foot (or fill a tube sock with dry rice/beans, and tie it around your foot). Start with making it all the way through comfortably before you start adding weight though, you want to build the muscles, not stress them!"
Equestrian,3d51wg,alb3124,2,Mon Jul 13 16:55:28 2015 UTC,"Wow, great idea! I'm grateful I didn't had to break my tibia to get this awesome tip ;) I'll definitely incorporate that as my ankles get stronger. Thanks so much!!"
Equestrian,3d51wg,blooheeler,2,Mon Jul 13 17:01:38 2015 UTC,"I did something similar, but put marbles in and out of a shoebox lid with my toes recovering from an injury."

Equestrian,3d51wg,BirdLadySadie,1 point,Mon Jul 13 19:54:36 2015 UTC,"Yes! That's another one! (Although I had to pick up 3"" bolts instead of marbles) Also, stand on a pillow with one foot, find your balance, then close your eyes, and try to maintain balance. It's amazing how much you get from visual cues, but the practice without it really helps you learn to strengthen your ankles."
Equestrian,3d51wg,_dropsofjupiter,2,Tue Jul 14 13:36:50 2015 UTC,"Wow, amazing tip! I broke by tib  (riding of course) 18 m ago and whilst I'm mostly back to normal, any exercises help"
Equestrian,3d51wg,palinodial,3,Mon Jul 13 22:28:58 2015 UTC,"Try standing up in your stirrups and staying up and balancing at the walk. This should help you relax down and put some more weight in your heels. It also helps with balance and overall seat/leg positioning :)  As for your feet pointing outwards, make sure your whole leg isn't turned. The inside of your thighs and the inside-ish portion of your knees should be against the saddle.  If your knees are pointing outwards, then it really would hurt to keep your feet pointed forwards while the rest of your leg is still rolled outwards.  Although, for people like me whose feet are still pointed outwards even if my knees are straight, it's pretty much impossible to have straight toes. Haha. But that's where your instructor might be able to help.    There are no dumb questions!!! :)"
Equestrian,3d51wg,Clairoee,1 point,Tue Jul 14 00:38:43 2015 UTC,Thank you so much for the insight! I'll definitely look at my hip/knee position next lesson - it could very well be that my ankle problems are originating from a wrong placement or angle of a joint higher up. And thanks too for saying there are no dumb questions :) :)
Equestrian,3d51wg,Clairoee,2,Tue Jul 14 13:33:58 2015 UTC,"I ride western, so I'm not sure if I'll be of any help. Something I emphasize with new riders is that your weight should be on the widest part of your foot- that strong pad, never in the arch.   Some mental games that help you think about your posture in the saddle:  Place a feather under each foot in the stirrup at the beginning of your ride. You should finish the ride with both feathers intact. It's a helpful mental cue for a lot of people, similar to ""don't pop the rubber band"" (pretending your reins are attached to the bit with a thin rubber band) and ""don't pop the water balloon"" (pretending there's a pancake-shaped water balloon under your butt so you don't plop into your seat while riding the post). Another one I tell beginners (and myself!) is to imagine there is a wire attached to the top of your head, pulling you straight up- it should align your shoulders, hips, and heels. Keep your eyes on the rail (or at or above your horse's ears) - this always automatically deepens your seat and helps your weight settle properly.   As for the ankle pain- you may have weak ankles. :) In western disciplines, pointing the toes outward as well as a bit upward is acceptable. Think frog legs, with your heels closer to the horse than your toes. I don't know if this is incorrect for English, but a bit of an outward angle may help ease the tension you feel in your ankles. Generally, the more you ride, the more muscle you will develop, particularly in your thighs and calves, the less strain you'll feel on your joints."
Equestrian,3d51wg,Clairoee,2,Mon Jul 13 16:23:58 2015 UTC,"Thank you so much for that thorough and prompt reply! I'm definitely going to take those mental games into my next lesson - they sound really constructive.   Also, you're right, I probably do have weak ankles :) If that's a big part of the problem, doing more exercises and riding more will help. I'm a little embarrassed to admit that I didn't even consider physiological weakness as a possible cause of the issue, but now that you say that, I'm sure you're onto something!  Thanks again - I really appreciate it :)"
Equestrian,3d51wg,Dutchy8210,2,Mon Jul 13 16:28:04 2015 UTC,"No worries! Posture, ""soft hands"", weight distribution, and ""look where you want to go- not at the ground!"" are very literally things I say to myself every single ride, every day. I've been riding for about twenty years now and I can still walk out of the arena after a show and my sister-in-law will say, ""girl, you would have nailed the water box transition to the narrow bridge if you had just looked up!"
Equestrian,3d51wg,NeverendingStarchild,2,Mon Jul 13 16:39:27 2015 UTC,"You make an excellent point - I shouldn't expect it to happen overnight, or even something that I can address for once and for all. And I, too, should be thinking about soft hands, where I'm looking, and my weight - this might just be one more thing to gently remind myself of on a daily basis :)"
Equestrian,3d51wg,hasufelmere,2,Mon Jul 13 16:46:49 2015 UTC,"I struggled with keeping my toes straight my whole lesson career. Then I just started riding to ride and I've come to the conclusion it's just the way my feet are turned. I honestly can't think of a reason for keeping them exactly straight, other than spur control maybe.   I know exactly what you mean by the weak and achy ankles. It's terrible, and when something makes you dread the activity you're doing for fun, something needs to change."
Equestrian,3d51wg,dunmorestriden,2,Mon Jul 13 16:50:24 2015 UTC,"That's a really good point. I'll make a conscious effort to stop rolling my ankles - it's certainly not adding to them getting stronger, and only hurts; hopefully just from riding more and getting a more supple leg, I can improve my food position without doing something that undermines the idea of having a strong and supple leg!   Thanks for the insight; it's much appreciated - and yes, perhaps riding to ride (without overthinking things, as I'm so inclined to do!) should definitely help me figure out what's even realistic for the way my own body is put together. Maybe there's a better way for me to practice foot position, maybe there isn't; but forcing what isn't uncomfortable on weak ankles probably isn't doing me any good :)"
Equestrian,3d51wg,dunmorestriden,2,Mon Jul 13 16:53:11 2015 UTC,"I struggle with the same issue, even after many years of riding. My build lends to my ankles pronating outward, and it feels weird when they are in the proper position. One thing that helped me (and I think someone else already pointed this out) is to make sure the bar of your foot (the widest part) is fully in the stirrup. From there, balance and tip a little of your weight in your heel, which is a better position for jumping.       I have the issue too of putting too much weight in my heels for dressage, because of hold over muscle memory from Western days. Your seat should be balanced enough that your foot is not falling back or out as you post.   Also check out some different stirrup options like these:  http://www.statelinetack.com/item/jointed-stirrup-irons-pair/SLT733093/  http://www.statelinetack.com/item/korsteel-flex-ii-stirrup-irons/SLT734803/  http://www.doversaddlery.com/composite-reflex-stirrup-irons/p/X1-0742/   they are more forgiving than rigid ones. I have something similar to the last pair, and it helped so much with my ankle and knee pain because it has a slight spring to the pad."
Equestrian,3d51wg,dunmorestriden,1 point,Mon Jul 13 17:40:25 2015 UTC,"Wow, thank you! I really appreciate the resources you've left me with. I'm probably trying to put too much weight in my heels, too; what you said about ""tip a little of your weight"" made me realize that I'm sitting-- well, I'm sitting wrong; maybe sitting a little too deeply or heavily in the saddle to try to put more weight in my heels. This is opening my eyes to a lot of things that I should be working on, and how I can best be going about it.  In my next lesson, I'll ask my instructor to give me feedback that my foot isn't falling back/out as I post; I feel like it isn't, but I also don't have the perspective to know one way or the other. Her analysis will help me figure out, and I'm glad to know to ask about it now, too!"
Equestrian,3d51wg,dunmorestriden,2,Mon Jul 13 17:44:47 2015 UTC,"I've been riding since I was 7, my right foot won't point straight and I'm not sure it ever will but as a beginner I wouldnt worry too much about straight feet.  As for the rest, when  they say put your weight into your heels its not all your weight, unless of course you're standing. Its your leg's weight. Most of your weight should be distributed through your bum and upper thigh, then your legs weight should be distributed through your heel. Think of your feet as springs which absorb the movement of the horse, thats why we should have heels down, if they werent, you wouldnt absorb the movement downwards. So the weight goes down your calf into your heel.   Make sure the stirrup is on the ball of your feet and make sure the strirrup leathers are twisted correctly around your leg.   Then for training your ankles and absorbing movement, I'd practice trotting. First just do normal rising trot, then try standing for three beats, sitting for one. Then five- one. Maybe two two. Just mix and match so you have control over your legs not the movement of the horse. Then see how long yu can stand without toppling in trot. Try and absorb it all through your calves. Can work up to doing rising canter and standing in canter. Your ankles may ache but hopefully you'll get better with your heels down and strong ankles."

I like the idea/visual of the heels as springs; I think that'll help me keep them lighter and supple. I also suspect that from not trying to push down into my heels so much, my ankles will hurt less. And in the meantime, I love your suggestion about how train my ankles and absorb movement using the exercises you mentioned in the trot and canter.  Thank you!! This was really, really helpful :D"

Equestrian,3d5eyc,palinodial,-3,Tue Jul 14 12:57:45 2015 UTC,"wellies should be fine, basically you need shoes with a SMALL heel. So that if their foot slips forward it doesnt go all the way through and you get your leg caught in the stirrup. If she takes it up you can get proper boots but wellies should be fine - https://metrouk2.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/topman-green-wellington-boots-c2a325-00-e1373375431185.jpg kind of thing"
Equestrian,3d5eyc,nihil504,10,Mon Jul 13 17:57:01 2015 UTC,"Please not wellies. I teach a riding summer camp and every so often a kid will show up with wellies. They are much too big in the calf and foot and prevent the child from being able to properly keep their heels down. Sometimes they don't even fit in the stirrups. As a camp instructor, I recommend paddock boots or something structurally similar. It's your child's safety, don't compromise that."

Equestrian,3d11o3,spud_simon_salem,6,Sun Jul 12 17:08:02 2015 UTC,"I think you are worrying far too much. First off it sounds like he is accustomed to moving. Second, lots of horses go through some stress at relocation, but he will get over it rapidly. A huge number of horses make big moves all the time. They go around the country for shows and breeding, they fly over seas, the are bought and sold every few years. They all just take different amounts of time to settle depending on their personalities. I don't think it will damage your relationship in anyway to take him with you. Horses are very intelligent as we all know, but I don't think they have the cognitive function to really rationalize a move as something you caused to happen therefor they will be wary or suspicious of you. Nor do I think your horse is capable of worrying about being sold. When horses are sold they can miss their owners obviously, but that is different than worrying about being sold or moved some time in the future.   Some horses can experience physical side effects from long moves due to the stress, but talk to your vet, there are supplements and medications to help with that.   If you want to take him with you take him. He will be fine. He may be nervous at first because of the new surroundings, but adjustment Time and patience will take care of that and he wont hold animosity."
Equestrian,3d11o3,KnightRider1987,2,Sun Jul 12 18:50:20 2015 UTC,Clearly I'm being pretty neurotic about the situation but your comment is starting to put my mind at ease. Thank you!
Equestrian,3d11o3,royallyred,3,Sun Jul 12 19:09:21 2015 UTC,"Honestly thought this was going to be about breaking a barn contract, haha. Nah, your horse will do just fine. Our barn hosts a few different individual training programs, one of which has very expensive horses (we're talking $200,000 and up range) who do the big shows. They show their horses all over the place, sometimes for months at a time and their horses do just fine. Horses all need to adjust to new places, and most of em will take a while to settle in, but it shouldn't be  an issue. As someone else said sometimes moves can be stressful-which can be harmful-but you can talk to your vet to discuss how to negate stress. If anything your horse will be happy to have a familiar face in a new area!"
Equestrian,3d11o3,deliciouslysaucy,2,Sun Jul 12 21:33:37 2015 UTC,"Take a deep breath. He's gonna be fine as long as you're there for him.  The long distance move will require an adjustment period, but horses make longer, more dramatic moves all the time and settle in just fine. If he's done the lessons/showing thing he's probably shipped locally enough to be a reasonably good traveler. You can do a lot to make the trip/adjustment period more comfortable for him (e.g. UlcerGard, electrolytes, shipping him in a box stall, buying a stash of ""home"" hay to permit a slow transition to Chicago hay).  The alternative is to sell him, right? That could potentially lead to another local move for him and would certainly require him to adjust to different management. So there's really no way to completely insulate him from the changes in your life.   The horse unfortunately can't weigh in on what he'd prefer, but I'd imagine that if they were capable of the required abstract thought, most horses would choose a few days of relocation stress to earn a lifetime of good care rather than roll the dice on being sold off. It's up to you to weigh your personal considerations against the impact on the horse, but don't feel like you're letting him down if you move him again.  Good luck with everything! With six weeks to your potential move I bet you have lots of planning to do!"
Equestrian,3d11o3,nihil504,1 point,Sun Jul 12 19:52:19 2015 UTC,"Coincidentally, I live near Chicago and ride at a barn in the area too. We just bought our own facility and moved the entire business in January... All the horses, tack, furniture, everything. At first the horses were weirded out, calling, smelling, whatnot. But with a little hay, some lunch for those who get grain and some turnout, everybody settled in within days. As long as they get the care they need, a move need not be stressful. Take a deep breath. Sounds like you have more stress than your horse! If you love your horse, there's no reason to sell him to spare him the move."
Equestrian,3d11o3,comptiger5000,1 point,Sun Jul 12 20:05:11 2015 UTC,I'm originally from Chicago but I wasn't into horses when I lived there. How's the horse scene there? Specifically hunter/jumper. How much are you able to ride in the winter? One barn I've been looking at is heated and has an indoor arena (not sure if that's heated or not). Are you still able to ride and train in an indoor arena (in the winter) as much as you can when the weather is good?
Equestrian,3d11o3,nihil504,1 point,Sun Jul 12 21:59:02 2015 UTC,"Being in upstate NY, I can say that if you've got an indoor to stay out of the snow / ice, even if it's un-heated, you can ride until it's too cold for you or your horse to be comfortable.  Some horses will need a quarter sheet or other things to keep them warm enough while riding, especially if they're normally blanketed.    Personally, I've ridden down to just above 0* F in an unheated indoor and I have friends with very cold-tolerant horses that have ridden when it's been a few degrees sub-zero (sometimes even outside)."
Equestrian,3d11o3,blooheeler,1 point,Mon Jul 13 00:35:09 2015 UTC,"Horse scene varies. I'm at a relatively high end barn where the kids do the A shows and whatnot. I don't show as I'm a poor adult but I work, ride, and hang out, which is all I want anyway. The farther you get from the city, the cheaper, but you have to deal with Chicagoland traffic.   We have a heated indoor that stays about 40-50 degrees with the heaters on. At our old place there were a few days where the heaters couldn't keep the indoor warm enough, but our new place has a new heater and it's practically tropical in the indoor. We didn't miss a single day of riding this winter. Our pro riders ride everyday during the winter. Our aisle is heated too and attached to the indoor so there's no interruption with riding.  Facilities vary though, so definitely take a tour before you commit."
Equestrian,3d11o3,blooheeler,1 point,Mon Jul 13 21:47:25 2015 UTC,"He will be totally fine. Horses travel all over the country and beyond all the time. The biggest issue I've ever come across while hauling my mares is that they don't like the ""new"" water. Well, and that one time we moved in next to a llama- but that was traumatic for everyone. And they even got over that after about a month of their eyes rolling the the back of their heads like they were possessed every time I turned them out. Rest assured- every horse will eventually drink the new water and get used to their new frenemies at the new location!   Best of luck with your move!"

Another one will rack occasionally if he gets wound up and you get in his face too much. Rode a standardbred who paced when nervous. All three were encouraged to immediately trot though, so while I kind of got a taste of the gait I never got to enjoy it because they weren't supposed to be gaiting. :("

Equestrian,3czamv,NeverendingStarchild,1 point,Sun Jul 12 03:47:52 2015 UTC,Glad you found them! I used on one jumper awhile back and referred to them as scalper bell boots.

I got the pair from dover. But he has to live in bell boots to stop pulling shoes while we fix his angle. So I'm planning on him losing a boot at some point  outside in mud.
Equestrian,3czamv,NeverendingStarchild,1 point,Wed Jul 15 02:46:30 2015 UTC,Are you going to be riding or turning your horse out in the scalpers? We would just use these for jumper competitions because the band across the front tends to slide up over time which can put pressure on the coronet band and cut of circulation. The benefit for the jumpers was that if the horse skimmed a jump with their toe that the likelihood of the rub staying up was better than with all the extra millimeters from a regular bell boot and for protection when caulks were being used. I would be worried putting these on a horse in a situation where their feet were not being monitored literally every second like turnout.

I'd asked ahead for him to be given some Ace to settle him down. It definitely seemed to help. We got him in the trailer with minimal issues. He wouldn't go in for my trainer, but when I took the rope, and my trainer popped him on the butt with a whip to make him think twice when he decided to think about refusing, he decided to hop right in. He tried to bail once he was in, but when I put tension on the rope, he stopped and let us close him in the slant and tie him up.  He unloaded fine and is now in a little 12x24 pen made out of half of the shelter and a few panels. The mares are living in the area around him, so they can talk over the fence and he can pretty much always see them, so hopefully he won't stress out too much.  He gets his sutures out in 3 weeks. We are to keep his leg wrapped until then and change the bandages every 2-3 days. He gets to be handwalked and grazed, but nothing else as far as exercise. And in 60 days, he will go back for more radiographs to see how things are progressing with the healing process."

Usually the really nice trainers will approach you if you stand out and ask if you ride or are looking for a trainer. Also, if you decide to take lessons with a trainer, the first time you speak to them about lessons, ask them if you can work around the barn in exchange for more riding or ask if they have any leases available within their training barn. A lot of trainers in our area actually love when someone wants to help them ride horses because they get really busy!"
Equestrian,3cuzr1,VulturesAreAwesome,3,Sat Jul 11 00:14:15 2015 UTC,"No prerequisites for riding. If you find a dressage instructor and tell them you have zero riding experience, like a trainer of any discipline, they will first teach you walk, trot, canter then get into dressage as a separate entity."
Equestrian,3cuzr1,spud_simon_salem,4,Sat Jul 11 01:58:04 2015 UTC,"There are no prerequisites. If you have any kind of riding experience then that will help but you can start from scratch too. In fact, I have known some dressage trainers who like to have students who haven't been ""polluted"" by the hunt seat (ie jumping) world. I think it's silly but some trainers are like that. In fact, my first trainer was.  That brings me to a point: don't settle for the first trainer you find. Shop around. The barn should be nice and the horses should be happy and well-cared-for. You can use RateMyHorsePro to look at their credentials. Whomever you use should be certified and have show records that you can look up. Most importantly, if you take a few lessons with them and they make you feel bad about yourself, don't stick around. I made that mistake when I first started taking dressage after transitioning from a strictly h/j background and it really impacted my self-esteem.   If you want, to help prepare you if you're coming from a completely non-horsey background, you can read up about equine conformation, parts of a saddle, and things like that.

Equestrian,3cuzr1,diamonte,4,Sat Jul 11 22:53:08 2015 UTC,"I ride dressage, so I'm happy you to answer any specific questions you might have about it. =)  As others said, the first step is just learning how to ride like you would with any other discipline. You won't really focus on what the horse is doing (like doing dressage movements such as shoulder-in, half-pass, etc.) but building your strength to hold your riding position, and learning to be relaxed and supple in your own body so that you can move ""with"" the horse. You could be with a trainer of any discipline for this part, just as long as they're good at starting new riders. They should do lots of lessons on the lunge line with you, and lots of no stirrup work. You won't have the knowledge to ride on your own for a while, so the more lessons you can do, the faster you can improve. Outside of just time in the saddle, you can work on your own strength, flexibility, and body awareness by doing yoga/pilates. But mostly, it's just learning to ride and trying to cement good equitation into your muscle memory.  After a while, maybe a year or so, you'll have learned how to walk, trot, and canter while staying balanced and relaxed in the saddle and moving with the horse. Then your lessons will focus more on the horse, in a way. Your trainer will start teaching you how to supple the horse (put it ""on the bit"") which will help the horse carry itself better and not brace its back. Riding a horse that is tense and braced in the back is much more unpleasant for both you and your horse. You'll also start learning how to adjust the horse within its gaits and being more refined about your 'steering' aids. So this is the part where you're actually learning more dressage."
Equestrian,3cuyr7,iamagiant,2,Sat Jul 11 00:05:36 2015 UTC,"I don't have experience with Dubarry boots, but have you considered half chaps?  At the barn I wear jeans and steel toe boots. When I ride I throw on half chaps. I wear breeches and 'real' boots for actual lessons, and for showing of course, but at home I have found that practicality just reigns supreme."
Equestrian,3cuyr7,AtomicPenny,2,Sat Jul 11 11:26:08 2015 UTC,"I feel like it's best to get something separate for riding & mucking - you need a level of water-proof/pee-proof/abuse-proof-ness that most boots that can sort of double as riding boots can't provide (I'm looking at you, dublin river boots, ariat brossards, & dubarry galways). I do have a pair of the dubarry clares, & while they are a fantastic ""all-terrain"" (I've hiked in them as well as riding) boot, I think they'd get wrecked if used as a regular muck boot.  I second the suggestion of half chaps over some kind of durable work boot."
Equestrian,3cuyr7,booksaboutthesame,1 point,Sun Jul 12 00:45:12 2015 UTC,"I have the Dubarry Clare's and LOVE them. I've hiked glaciers, mucked stalls and gone trail riding at the beach in them. They're great ""all around"" boots. I would definitely recommend getting all the leather care products for them as well because if you take care of them and keep them water repellent, they last ages. Mine are only 3 years old so I haven't broken anything on them yet, but I've read a lot of fantastic reviews on service and repairs as well.   I tend to stick with paddock boots and half chaps for riding but I don't muck a bunch of stalls (I board full care) and I take precautions to wear wellies for bathing- it's really the wetness that wears the boot leather out."

Equestrian,3csxdj,buckerupbuttercup,3,Fri Jul 10 16:24:59 2015 UTC,"Hunter/jumper rider here...  For lessons, from the bottom up... - Paddock boots - Ariats are my favorite - taken care of they'll last a long time.   Half chaps - Treadstep is my go-to - get one size tighter and one size taller than is comfortable, they stretch! Good riding breeches - People like Kerrits. I have a couple pairs of Tailored Sportsman that I've had for 15+ years. Huntley Equestrian also has some nice breeches.  Belt - if your breeches have belt loops, use them.  A good sportsbra! A fitted top. Your instructor will have an easier time correcting your position if s/he can see your upper body. I like wearing something with a long-sleeve to avoid sunburns and roadrash if I happen to buy real estate.  A good helmet. Something that is comfortable, and has great safety ratings. I had a GPA for years, and more recently switched to Charles Owen. Neither are inexpensive, but your brain is important.  Gloves. Something comfortable, washable, and breathable.    Good luck!!

Equestrian,3csxdj,SkylineDrive,3,Fri Jul 10 17:13:16 2015 UTC,"I ride in either a fitted tee or a tank top. I prefer to leave my shirts untucked, I feel like it looks better. You will also need gloves if you don't have them, I like the Neuman Tackified."

Equestrian,3csxdj,AtomicPenny,3,Fri Jul 10 16:44:56 2015 UTC,"Tuck the shirt for breeches, not necessary for tights. I find a ""when in Rome"" policy is always best- I started later in life at a barn that was strictly breeches/belt/collared shirt tucked in, but at my current barn they wear riding tights and tank tops are acceptable so I'm usually a bit overdressed.   I'd say for beginning lessons, at least riding tights (honestly I prefer the more structured material of breeches and particularly like the Ariat Heritages that come in colors- brown, blue, black, grey are great for schooling at home and don't stain as readily as tan/light colors!) and paddock boots/half chaps for sure. Wait to upgrade to field boots when/if you start showing because your leg muscles will change as you adapt and get in shape and half chaps are a bit more forgiving. I like Tredstep half chaps because they come in a variety of calf and height sizes- I would advise buying one size tighter and taller (so smaller around and a bit longer) than you think you measure because they do stretch quite a bit! Also like Ariat paddock boots."
Equestrian,3csxdj,stopbuffering,1 point,Fri Jul 10 17:36:39 2015 UTC,In lessons wear a more fitted shirt so your instructor can better see and evaluate your form. A lot can be hidden in a baggy tee!
Equestrian,3csxdj,NeverendingStarchild,2,Fri Jul 10 22:02:45 2015 UTC,"I've been riding English for 17 years (jumpers, hunters, dressage, trail) and have always preferred good jeans (not skinny jeans, not baggy jeans), paddock boots, a shirt, and a good bra. Never had any issues. A couple years ago I got half chaps that where really comfortable so I started wearing them as well. So unless your barn has a dress code it really doesn't matter, especially not that first. It also depends on if you're going to show or not. I don't show so I never needed show clothes (except for with my college's Equestrian team, and then I had to ride in tall boots and breeches sometimes to get used to it).  And, of course, a good and comfortable helmet."
Equestrian,3csxdj,horseyanon,2,Fri Jul 10 16:32:38 2015 UTC,"I love my Tuff Rider zip field boots. Would they hold up if I was schooling 5+ horses and teaching in them all day? Most likely not, but for $300 and my 3-5 rides per week / occasional show they work wonders and are no more expensive then a good pair of paddock boots and half chaps. Kerrits are my favorite brand of breeches/tights. For under $100 you can't really ask for more. I want 4 more pairs. Get a helmet based on what fits you're head best and is within your budget. Each trainer will have a preference, especially if you go to shows. I just bought a pair of Heritage riding gloves for $25 that work just as well as the more expensive brands. Having your own crop is nice because the school ones always seem to be clumsy. I like one with a stopper on the end so it never falls through my hand. I also really want a collection of these show shirts to use for schooling. Many brands make them but they have a zip collar and are mesh in the armpits and underarms so they offer sun protection, style and comfort. I've been blessed to not get a farmer's tan yet this year!"
Equestrian,3csxdj,SkylineDrive,2,Fri Jul 10 18:57:29 2015 UTC,"You can start off with a polo shirt (tucked in), a pair of breeches (these can get quite expensive but you really only need to spend about $30 for a beginning pair), and a pair of paddock boots and half chaps. The place where you're taking lessons may or may not provide a helmet for you but if it doesn't, you will need to go to a tack shop to get one fitted for your head.   I noticed someone recommend a pricey helmet brand and I have to disagree about that. Any helmets sold in the USA/Canada/Europe have to meet their country's safety standards, so a $500 GPA is going to have the same value of protection as a $70 helmet or even a $30 helmet. Unless one helmet specifically states, ""meets standards,"" while another says, ""exceeds standards,"" then you really can't claim there to be a difference other than fashion and current show trends.  Also, keep in mind that you absolutely have to get a new helmet as soon as you have a fall with it that involves your head, so if you have $500 helmet and fall on your head with it, that can get very pricey. The high-density impact foam is what protects your head, and only works once.  /helmet PSA over."
Equestrian,3csxdj,NeverendingStarchild,4,Sat Jul 11 06:20:17 2015 UTC,"I LOVE Kerrit's riding tights, I wear Ariat Heritage boots but when I was first starting off I wore Ariat paddock boots with halfchaps (if you can get Tredstep those are great, but I have Horze soft leather halfchaps)  Also if you're waiting on shipping or not wanting to drop everything at once, I ride in yoga pants fairly frequently when I'm too lazy ... for me it's always just been important that I have really good stretch in the fabric around my hips."
Equestrian,3csxdj,SkylineDrive,3,Fri Jul 10 15:21:21 2015 UTC,Upvoted! I just bought a pair of the Kerrits tights and am in love! Its 100+ F here in AZ and they are so breathable.

They are EVERYTHING. You can find them at TJ Maxx. I don't wear them for jumping because I like a little extra grip. Okay so actually sometimes when I am lazy I do wear them jumping but I really shouldn't and I'm not jumping more than 18 inches at the moment.   Edit to add- if you have girls invest in a good sports bra or you will hate your life."

Equestrian,3cuegd,Griffinwolf8,3,Fri Jul 10 21:26:42 2015 UTC,"His long withers make an optical illusion of his long back appearing shorter. His back slopes downhill and this in combination with the long withers may make it hard for correct saddle fitting. the front of your saddle may need to be checked regularly because it could get compacted faster than other areas. Make sure to have a wool flocked saddle, not foam. His flank/sacroliliac area looks weak and will need conditioning to protect against injury. Short croup, high set tail. Shorter neck and might have what looks like a thicker throatlatch(you will always be working on stretching his neck and nose out in front of him) Clean legs, but I cant see his feet. Dry lots are good to keep feet hard, but make sure the horse isn't exercising in sand that deep or you can risk tendon injury.  Kind eye and nice expression. His short mouth and tense chin may indicate stubbornness but you may see changes in his facial muscle as you two form a bond of trust.  A nice horse, with some minor conformation faults that work against potential athleticism, but if you know them you can condition his way of going to help him. Good horse for low to middle levels of competition."

He had his little bay roan gelding doing half passes AFTER he admitted he had never ridden that particular horse before.  After that we attended a jumping demonstration by George Morris and I quickly found out that man has a seat like nobody I've ever seen before.  One of the riders that he was coaching in the arena (he was not riding himself) couldn't get his grey mare over the fences so George said ""here give her to me"".  Proceeded to get on her and urge her over every single jump including after he lost his stirrups and was holding on by willpower alone.  It was the most insane bit of riding I had ever seen.

Equestrian,3crrqw,ChemNerd23,2,Fri Jul 10 06:30:34 2015 UTC,I've been thinking about changes of pace in canter? But he does struggle to collect and he gets unbalanced pretty easily. :/
Equestrian,3crrqw,thevoodoothatyoudo,3,Fri Jul 10 13:46:38 2015 UTC,"Collection is extremely difficult for a horse. Until your horse is light and balanced, I wouldn't focus on that. Transitions and half halts are great and I would add trotting poles and raised trotting poles as well. Having adjustability within a gait is important and you can certainly add lengthening and shortening as an exercise--just keep in mind that the more you compress, the more leg you need to support with. I like to think of having three versions of the trot or canter (working, shortened, lengthened). The walk is crucial and can be messed with very quickly so I tend to work more with lateral movements through the walk, rather then adjusting the stride. The added bonus of doing a ton of transition work is that it also gets them snappy of the aids!"
Equestrian,3crrqw,Happy_Egg,4,Fri Jul 10 14:33:05 2015 UTC,"I'd recommend lateral work, it'll help with straightness too and lots of changing transitions. Makes for thinking."
Equestrian,3crrqw,Found_your_marbles,2,Fri Jul 10 07:42:16 2015 UTC,"I pretty much mainly do transitions and lateral work these days. Lots of shoulder-in and leg yields mainly, still training the travers and renvers. Do you think those last two will work?"
Equestrian,3crrqw,deliciouslysaucy,1 point,Fri Jul 10 13:45:16 2015 UTC,"You took the words right out of my mouth! some other ideas are haunches in, haunches out, transitions within the gate and out of the gate, trot in place into forward trot things like that.  Anything to get those hind legs moving quickly!  I also like to do canter trot transitions, and on a straight line move their haunches left and right.  Good luck:)  Can somebody please tell me why I'm being down voted? This works in my experience"
Equestrian,3crrqw,IamBre,2,Fri Jul 10 19:47:46 2015 UTC,"Transitions! It's as unsexy an answer as you're going to get, but it's the most-used tool in my own dressage toolbox and something that's come into play with everything from green youngsters to FEI. You can put together a pretty fun and difficult training ride with just transitions, and I like to do a lot of them when I warm horses up and any time I feel I'm not getting adequate response to my seat asking for longitudinal rebalancing."
Equestrian,3crrqw,thevoodoothatyoudo,2,Fri Jul 10 12:47:54 2015 UTC,"I have been doing loads of walk-to-canter, canter-to-walk and trot-canter transitions and they have worked to get him more uphill but I'm still not getting the sweat by his buttcheeks thing?"
Equestrian,3crrqw,deliciouslysaucy,5,Fri Jul 10 13:42:46 2015 UTC,As you are doing your downward transitions are you remembering to push him into the transitions?  So as you're pulling back on the reins you should be pushing him foward with your legs and seat into your hands if that makes sense
Equestrian,3crrqw,RonRonner,3,Fri Jul 10 20:16:16 2015 UTC,"Without actually seeing the transitions it is hard to evaluate them, but I guess my question would be, what is the quality of the transition and are you using too much hand, does the horse drop the front end rather then 'scoop under' with the hind end, and there strides in between the transitions etc."
Equestrian,3crrqw,NeverendingStarchild,2,Fri Jul 10 15:28:38 2015 UTC,"Well, walk to trot is good, he doesn't hollow out or anything. Trot to canter has gotten much better and more uphill. Walk to canter is getting there, I find that asking for a little travers and then asking for the canter works wonders for him.   The problem really lies with the downward transitions. Trot to walk is still fine but in the canter to trot he just breaks out and speeds off onto his forehand in a fast trot before slowing down. If I slam on the brakes he hollows out and resists me, if I use leg to rebalance him then it stops the hollowing out but not the going onto the forehand (he'll like pull me down almost). Canter to walk is a disaster (only recently started training it though). I feel so bad for yanking to get him to slow down but I'm not really sure how else to teach him what I'm trying to get him to do. Sigh."
Equestrian,3crrqw,NeverendingStarchild,2,Fri Jul 10 22:49:00 2015 UTC,"Keeping the horse forward and rhythmic in the downward transitions requires timing and balance, so if something like canter to trot causes rushing or slamming on the brakes he's not got the longitudinal balance to stay light, round, and forward through the transition. How balanced and straight is he in the canter? How balanced and elastic are you in the transition? Having a trainer's eyes on the ground can be crucial for assessing these things.  In your shoes I'd work a lot on transitions between sequential gaits, as well as trot-halt/halt-trot. Do you have any hills to hack out on? Hilly rides can provide a break from arena training while still working strength/balance (esp. if you walk the hills -- not quite the thrill as going faster but it forces them to work those hind ends).  It sounds like you may need to establish a little more balance, strength, and suppleness before you can do renvers, travers, and C-W/W-C correctly. And I'd wait to work on lengthenings too. You may want to play a bit with stride length at the walk and trot though, moving from a working walk and trot to smaller steps, then back up to working gaits, focusing on clear, timely responses to your seat aids. A lot of time when horses are still a little green (need more muscle, balance) the upward transitions feel o.k. but the downward transitions feel like crap. It isn't until you get the horse put together better that you realize that the upwards had room for improvement all along.   I know how tempting it can be to push for whatever seems within reach, but I promise you that if you get your horse really supple, straight, and responsive in the basic gaits and transitions before you go on to 2nd level movements they'll not only go a lot better, but you'll also move beyond even more quickly. All of the hard work in dressage has to do with the basics -- the rest is easy (at least relatively speaking!) once you've built a firm foundation."
Equestrian,3crrqw,AtomicPenny,1 point,Sat Jul 11 00:26:21 2015 UTC,"Thanks for all this, yeah, you're right. The lateral work helps to relax him and supple him at the beginning of the session so I've mostly been using it for that. I'll focus the rest of the session on doing what you've suggested! :)"
Equestrian,3crrqw,thevoodoothatyoudo,2,Sat Jul 11 05:35:09 2015 UTC,"Seconding (thirding?) transitions.  I would focus on walk-trot and halt-walk primarily but some TBs have naturally fabulous canters and seem to feel more comfortable working within that gait than other breeds.  If that's the case, go for it, but you're probably best off staying within 20m circles and doing spirals down to 12m rather than going large (the bigger the canter gets, the harder it will be to adjust)."

Equestrian,3cly2e,MyrtleLoadTheShotgun,4,Wed Jul 8 23:00:34 2015 UTC,"This is one of those issues that can be helped with a bit of groundwork.  I do an exercise here where you lunge a half of a ten-meter circle in the corner, then yield the hindquarters to change direction, and repeat.  You can easily direct them deeper into the corner each pass and the change of direction makes them focus on you.  In about 30 seconds most horses are going deep into the corner because it makes the direction change so much easier for them AND it's further away from the pressure (you).    When you mount up, use your inside leg to push into the corners.  Prepare for him to try and cut the corner and start thinking about that nice round quarter of a 10m circle a few strides before you get there, really shaping him up with steady outside aids, raise your inside hand a little, and put your inside leg on while putting a little more weight in your outside stirrup.  Exaggerate if you need to, this is training riding not show riding.    You'll need to do both the in-hand and under saddle work a few times before he completely stops trying to avoid the corner, but you should see a difference pretty quickly.  Good luck!"
Equestrian,3cly2e,nefariousmango,6,Thu Jul 9 04:19:21 2015 UTC,"Depending on your horse, circling them back through the corner can increase the anxiety. I had the same issue with my mare, and I would leg yield her into the corner and halt her, then pick her up and carry on.   I made the scary corners a place where work didn't happen, and the nice corners were where the hard stuff was done.   She soon picked up on it."
Equestrian,3cly2e,showmebevelle,2,Thu Jul 9 03:14:37 2015 UTC,"Spend some time at the beginning of your ride as you're warming up, walk a few laps around the arena and push with your inside heel and leg as he gets to the corner. You can also pull with your inside rein if the leg isn't enough. If this still really riles him up, back it up a step and hand walk him past the corners BEFORE you begin your ride."
Equestrian,3cly2e,rhizaee,1 point,Thu Jul 9 00:15:47 2015 UTC,"The horse I ride does the opposite - he turns his head to look at the scary corner, pops his inside shoulder out and then cuts the corner - so I shift both hands to the outside and hold him with my inside leg/spur for less than three seconds then leg yield back to the rail. He usually works out of it. If I make a big deal about it then he usually gives himself anxiety. I would also think about cutting his feed back."
Equestrian,3cly2e,NeverendingStarchild,-8,Mon Jul 20 18:53:26 2015 UTC,"Horses are herd animals. Corners freak herd animals out. They shouldn't really ever be expected to go into them, in my opinion.   With your corners, you say that the two in particular he hates have large dirt piles. It could be that he sees those as some kind of obstacle that he doesn't want to deal with.   Can you move the dirt and make them normal corners, like I assume the other corners you have him going into are?"
Equestrian,3cly2e,Ephemeral_Halcyon,9,Wed Jul 8 23:04:25 2015 UTC,"That's a new one. I have never heard someone say that you shouldn't expect to ride through a corner.  I would take the opposite stance and say people don't work enough on using their corners effectively. It offers you a lot of additional space to get more strides to a fence, regroup, or just be compepent and transmit aids to your horse. My gelding doesn't like falling leaves, I still ride him in the fall and make him get over it.  A lot of things we expect them to do is against their herd instincts. In the pasture they can react how they wish. With a person on the ground or in the saddle they have to listen even if it's a different action than their pasture reaction would be. Scary noise in the pasture? Take off and buck and squeal to your heart's content. Scary noise with me? Don't be losing ypur mind. Corners are no different.  If I want a deep corner then that's what we're doing.   If it's a scary one then I am walling off that inside by not letting them drop their shoulder, pushing that body over, and keeping them properly bent through it. The corner isn't scary for long if you just expect them to do it, they relax and it just ceases to be a problem."

Equestrian,3ckujl,classy_stache,6,Wed Jul 8 18:19:10 2015 UTC,"She sounds like she is a bit green. I use an opening or guiding rein w outside leg when teaching green horses to turn because direct rein contact can be easily confused to mean brake! When the horse speeds from the leg pressure, remind her to keep a consistent pace by calmly implementing half halts. I look early and ask early for the turn which is generally just a big turn across the middle from wall-to-wall. Anything smaller and the green ones get too nervous about tripping over themselves to understand why there is pressure in their mouth. When training a new skill, I always make sure the horse has mastered a skill at the walk before asking for the action at the trot (or at the trot before asking at the canter). Until the horse is understanding how to turn at the walk, I would keep the trot work simple and get the horse moving straight at a consistent rhythm on the quarter line while incorporating walk-trot transitions.  Make sure to never hold pressure for more than three seconds because the horse will get heavy and dull rather than soft. If the horse does not give after three seconds than I ask again with slightly more pressure until the desired response is given then reward with some verbal praise and a neck rub. Even if the horse does not give 100% of what is desired, as soon as the horse gives in at all then the rider has to give so the horse understands what is being asked of it."
Equestrian,3ckujl,NeverendingStarchild,2,Wed Jul 8 19:20:34 2015 UTC,"Use a round pen if you can, for your first rides you need to treat her like a baby who doesn't know anything because that's kind of what she sounds like she is. Go where she wants to go in the round pen and give her the aids as she goes, she'll eventually get the hang of it. I would suggest working with a trainer as starting horses on the aids can be confusing and counterintuitive if you're doing it for the first time. Also, as a side note, I really really hope you aren't paying anything for this lease (meaning you have a free lease situation)."

Equestrian,3cjx8f,GeniusIamnot,9,Wed Jul 8 14:19:21 2015 UTC,"Those are all terrible stories but I think we have to evaluate unavoidable risk, avoidable risk and freak accident.  Horses and humans are both mortal and will die.  Most die late in life from complications of old age but every living animal is capable of being struck down ""before their time"".  Horses die from idiopathic causes out in the field (I know many people who have known an otherwise healthy horse found dead in the paddock the next morning--aneurysm, hemorrhage, cardiac arrest from undiagnosed heart murmurs...).  People die the same way, every day. It's so banal that we rarely hear about it.  It just happens.  That's clearly unavoidable.  It's a condition of mortality.  The rider Oksana who died in the jumping accident really actually died during a flying change in which her mare gave a small buck and the unseated rider was unlucky enough to be stepped in a terrible spot while on the ground.  That's a freak accident in my book.  People fall off horses all the time with little to no consequence--the fact that she was stepped on and that she was stepped on in such a way that caused internal bleeding was a tragic accident that couldn't have been prevented.  There's no indication that she was riding beyond her skill (the article said she had been riding since she was 3) and apparently she loved this mare that she had had for 3 months and the owner of the equestrian center said she was a lovely, tractable horse.  Nothing about this seems preventable to me, it just seems like the risk we take every time we get out of bed in the morning.   The chuckwagon deaths could stray into avoidable risk territory but it seems like the accident was initially caused by a horse that collapsed from a possible heart attack and the rest of the tragedy snowballed from there.  I don't think that any horse person is ever so callous as to be unaffected by the loss of a trusted partner and the driver was clearly devastated by the deaths of his horses.  Whether the chuckwagon racing constitutes a greater likelihood of something going wrong than something going right would tip it into the avoidable risk category for me but I don't know enough about the sport.  I know that I have very close friends who are very competitive eventers and their sport has been under a lot of scrutiny for high profile horse and rider injuries and deaths.  Not one rider I know (and these are from riders riding at Rolex) is blase about the risks they face when entering their really beloved horses in these events.  It's worthy of hard thought and close examination to eliminate avoidable risks on course, through rider qualifications, judge and vet discretion to DQ a horse or rider, jump reevaluation and safety equipment but nothing is ever going to get around the fact that horses and humans will sometimes suffer fatal injuries because that's simply part of life.  Surely we all know someone who has died or nearly died in a car accident and yet we weigh the risks and hopefully drive mindfully to avoid injury but still choose to drive.  We don't even tremble in our boots when doing it but given the odds, we probably should.    TL;DR: We are poor evaluators of risk and I think reading about horrible one-off accidents like you linked to are compelling because we are all fascinated/terrified by our own mortality, but rarely represent a realistic scale of danger.  We will all die and our horses will all die, and I think that's what we have to come to terms with."
Equestrian,3cjx8f,RonRonner,2,Wed Jul 8 14:43:19 2015 UTC,"Sure, all of them could be prevented if we didn't engage in equestrian activities, but that isn't likely to happen soon.  In terms of the Stampede, horses die at it every year, and the chuckwagon races have never been kind to the horses in them. To me, that says something about how maybe we need to prioritize animal safety over entertainment value (most non-horsey people enjoy the chuck wagon races) but at the same time, there's a risk involved with everything and even if we didn't have chuckwagon races we're likely to have freak accidents in other events that end in animal death. No matter what we do, we can't fully eliminate the risk, but I do feel that the chuckwagon races are pretty bad for that.  As for the rider dying in a jumping accident. It's an accident. They happen, unfortunately, and there are just too many factors for us to try to eliminate risk. I mean if the horse had just stepped on her arm, she might have crushed it and needed surgery but still have been alive. We have the added risk and ambiguity of an animal in addition to the potential accidents that can always happen. The bottom line is that horseback riding really is an extreme sport, and sometimes we forget about that.  As for a rider drowning in a river...look, there are some things we can do to avoid injury. Don't hack on a busy road, don't take your horse down a slippery/steep hill, etc. I wouldn't call crossing a river avoiding potential injury, the rider had no way of knowing the depth of the river in certain places and I'd be interested in knowing how much of a swimming ability the person had who was riding.  The bottom line is that we could avoid everything if we didn't take risks, but the nature of this sport is risk because as much as we don't like to think of it, there's an additional risk factor with a horse being involved, and it IS an extreme sport. The only way to avoid it is to not ride horses."
Equestrian,3cjx8f,sincerely-sacha,2,Wed Jul 8 15:03:13 2015 UTC,"As an industry? These don't look like preventable things. Rather, I should say they look like what I tend to refer to as inherent risk, which is risk that is unavoidable as a result of being part of a situation or industry."
Equestrian,3cjx8f,boredompwndu,1 point,Wed Jul 8 16:16:49 2015 UTC,"You can do things to minimise the risk as much as possible, although I think the accidents listed were sheer bad luck.  Simple things such as  always wear a hat and body protector. People think it's over the top because my horse is in her twenties and has been in the family before I was even born. Then I fell off because she spooked and spun on a trail we'd been on hundreds of times before and she stepped on my chest. My body protector saved me from a very nasty injury.  There will always be a risk - but as long as you have done a reasonable amount to protect yourself and dont do things outside your ability I dont think unlucky and rare accidents should scare people away from riding."
Equestrian,3cffi6,spud_simon_salem,17,Tue Jul 7 14:22:50 2015 UTC,"Definitely not. Most people just never encounter horses. When they do ride, it's on a trail horse that is trained to only walk and follow the horse in front of it, paying no attention to the rider. They can't imagine doing this dull activity all the time and therefore don't understand how we can. They didn't need to be in a proper position and never went faster than a walk, so they assume that faster speeds are just as easy. They've never had the experience of catching a horse in a field, brushing, tacking up, actually riding, untacking, cooling the horse out, walking them back to the field, etc. So they have no idea what really goes into riding. And most people just don't care. A good number of people want nothing to do with horses and just don't care about them at all. There's no way to convince a person like this that riding is a sport. Most non-horse people I know do not want to hear a thing about horses, so it's impossible to argue that riding is strenuous. I deal with it by just never talking about horses unless I'm asked."
Equestrian,3cffi6,Equestrian_Engineer,8,Tue Jul 7 15:14:03 2015 UTC,"Agreed.  The pony ride side that the bulk of people may experience isn't hard. It's not strenuous. It's not a workout. You don't need to do anything. There's no real way to explain ""but it's really difficult and requires a lifetime of practice!"" Unless they train instead of putt around somewhere they are going to think you're full of shit.  I don't see why this question always comes up though and why equestrians get so bothered by it. Who cares? Why waste energy being upset that someone with zero experience thinks it is easy or thinks it looks easy? We do it, we know the truth. They don't do it, they know the truth of the little they have experienced with it. Let other people think whatever they want, you can't explain or convince it, and it sounds whiny and combative to attempt to."
Equestrian,3cffi6,AtomicPenny,14,Tue Jul 7 15:30:18 2015 UTC,"I find the best comparison is swimming. When people say horseback riding isn't a sport because they've ridden before and felt nothing I reply that swimming isn't a sport because I walked around in a pool and felt nothing.   Horseback riding, like swimming, gives back what you put into it. You can play around in a pool like you can hop on a well-trained trail horse and ride around, or you can put real energy and effort into swimming laps like you can get on a well-trained show horse and put real energy and effort into a disciplined ride."

Equestrian,3cffi6,drink_your_tea,2,Tue Jul 7 20:54:14 2015 UTC,"Well I think swimmers do a lot of preparation and training outside the pool. I don't know much about swimming but I'm sure they work out and do other types of conditioning to improve their in-water performance. Just like how many of us equestrians would perform a little better if we did 30 minutes of cardio a day, you know?"
Equestrian,3cffi6,racehorsee,9,Wed Jul 8 16:53:59 2015 UTC,"Riding a horse on a trail does not equal actual training for competition type riding. People just think we get on and fool around.

After a lot of sitting trot my abs are aching."

So I don't think there's any point in arguing about athleticism!  But nothing is more fun than putting the truly athletic anti-equestrian on a horse. After a couple of minutes of kicking and pulling while the horse just stands there confused they usually realize that it involves a more complex skill set than they'd anticipated. And I've shut up more than one of my athlete friends with a minute or two of longeing at the trot on my moderately big mover -- if you tie up the reins so they can't brace on your horse's face and don't have a dummy strap on your saddle they tend to cry uncle pretty quick.

One really pissed her off one day, so she put him on one of her greener mares and gave him a few tasks to do (walk around the arena, etc.) Well after standing there puzzled for a bit, her mare got tired of the guy, threw her head down and started crow-hopping. Her friend freaked.   She admitted it wasn't the smartest thing to do, but it at least shut up her friends."

Equestrian,3cik22,indiefolkfan,4,Wed Jul 8 04:38:13 2015 UTC,I just bought an Ovation adjustable helmet to keep in the barn for students and to replace the troxel that I had in there before.  It was $45 on sale at Dover and seems to be a hit.
Equestrian,3cik22,AtomicPenny,1 point,Wed Jul 8 08:11:47 2015 UTC,Do you have a link?

Equestrian,3cik22,SGSHBO,2,Wed Jul 8 19:29:26 2015 UTC,I like that one thanks.
Equestrian,3cik22,misskinky,2,Wed Jul 8 20:47:51 2015 UTC,"Pardon my french but I FUCKING LOVE this helmet. The lowest profile of any helmet I've ever seen, and my head always stays cool. They grey is a lovely color."
Equestrian,3cik22,deliciouslysaucy,1 point,Thu Jul 9 03:24:06 2015 UTC,Yeah I actually just went through a whole ordeal where I bought and returned and bought and returned several different helmets and finally I ended up with the ovation deluxe schooler and I really like it I'm glad I chose it. At the store she told me ovation is better for people and rounder heads and Troxel is better for people with thinner/oval heads
Equestrian,3cik22,misskinky,2,Wed Jul 8 20:29:40 2015 UTC,"I've always classified those brands the other way around. A Troxel that barely fits front to back on my oval head will rattle side to side like a church bell on me!  Round: Troxel, Tipperary, GPA  Oval: International, Charles Owen, Ovation"
Equestrian,3cik22,deliciouslysaucy,1 point,Thu Jul 9 14:43:41 2015 UTC,"That's funny! Troxel feels like it's squeezing my head like a vice, but only in the one direction (like pressing above my temples and ears, but the next size up is way too big) whereas ovation fits pretty perfectly."
Equestrian,3cik22,misskinky,2,Thu Jul 9 15:32:28 2015 UTC,"Weird! I wonder if they've changed their fit? They've been pretty well known as a round-head brand for a good 15-20 years, so I'm surprised to hear about the vise effect! I've crammed my giant oval head into a few Ovation Deluxe Schooler models and they've always been a much better shape than the Troxels for me, but they're certainly not as far into long oval territory as IRH or Charles Owens can go."
Equestrian,3cik22,mrflossin,1 point,Thu Jul 9 15:40:37 2015 UTC,Maybe I just personally have a very strange head and the sales lady said that to make a sale. It wouldn't surprise me!! :)
Equestrian,3cik22,AtomicPenny,1 point,Thu Jul 9 15:49:35 2015 UTC,"Agree, the sort of ugly Ovation and Troxel helmets are really good for schooling or even low level showing. I fall a good amount of times and feel better if I replace my helmet, so I use these ugly ducklings at home so that when I whack my head I can get a new one for cheap versus spending $300 for a new Charles Owen every time I hit my head."
Equestrian,3cik22,ellevt,1 point,Wed Jul 8 19:26:21 2015 UTC,I'm an odd one who goes strictly old school non-ventilated velvet helmets for the ring...so the cheaper ovations don't look any uglier to me than the $300 Owens and such that everyone is running around in these days.  As long as they're a matte black and low profile instead of a shiny bobble headed beacon I don't really see a difference in schooling and show helmets these days and $50 vs $300. They all look the same to me. But I did hunters years ago when the only vented helmets were the big ass troxels and nobody wanted to bring those out in the light of day! So I think the new helmets just involuntarily give me flashbacks to those hellish things lol  I will admit to probably just being an overly conservative stickler for tradition haha
Equestrian,3cik22,IRaceBarrels,1 point,Wed Jul 8 19:43:44 2015 UTC,"This is what I have as well. Very cool and lightweight, the liner is removable and washable, and it has the dial to accommodate my growing hair.  I like it a lot! Not super stylish but it gets the job done."
Equestrian,3cik22,AtomicPenny,1 point,Thu Jul 9 06:40:59 2015 UTC,Personally I like the Tipperary Sportage helmet. They aren't the cheapest but they aren't cheaply made either. I have had mine for 11 years and just retired it. Its still in great shape. Very cool because of the vents. Feels secure. Very unlike a plastic bucket.
Equestrian,3cik22,Francie01,6,Wed Jul 8 05:05:32 2015 UTC,FYI helmets should be replaced approximately every 4 years (varies a bit manufacturer to manufacturer) even if they haven't been dropped or in a fall. The foam and other materials that will absorb the impact break down over time and become less effective.

I am about a decade older than you and have been taking lessons since the beginning of this year (never too old!). Last week's lesson I was cantering, did a full course of cross-rails, generally had my shit together. Last night? My horse was acting up, making me frustrated, and we spent the majority of the lesson just trotting. Never got to jump, and only cantered once about 3/4 of the way around the arena.   Just accept these days as learning lessons when they happen. And +1 for relaxing! Horses can tell if you're worked up! Deep breathes can help a ton."
Equestrian,3cgl0x,j43703,3,Wed Jul 8 04:12:06 2015 UTC,"I had never even touched a horse until I was 20 years old and I'm now eventing at the novice/training level just two and a half short years later and have owned my own OTTB for two of those years. Anything is possible! Just beware, you're going to get hooked and may wind up with a horse of your own sooner than you think ;)   Stay relaxed and have fun! You'll be sore as hell at first but you'll begin to develop the muscles used for riding rather quickly. If you love it, stick with it and the rest will fall into place! Good luck!"

Equestrian,3ch3em,Copycode4,6,Tue Jul 7 21:25:35 2015 UTC,"He just wants to go back to his paddock and hang out!  Start making the gate more work. You can give him a small whack on the butt or behind your leg with the crop if he ignores your request to move forward with your leg.   My general response to this sort of thing is to make them work harder. Stop at the gate? We're going to canter a 20m circle at that end of the arena a few times. Ask for a canter going into the corner before the gate and keep it. He might not want to canter- but a swift trot should get the idea across.   As soon as you feel him start to slow down to stop, make him work harder- upward transitions and circles are good for that.   As soon as it clicks in his head that he has to work harder any time he exhibits that behaviour he should stop doing it. You might get the odd recurrence of the behaviour but just get on him to go faster."
Equestrian,3ch3em,altf4life,5,Tue Jul 7 21:33:19 2015 UTC,"I just also want to add, never ever stop and dismount at that gate. I'm guessing people have been doing that so he is being hopeful that the work is done and he can leave. I agree with the other replies. The gate should mean more work."
Equestrian,3ch3em,IRaceBarrels,6,Wed Jul 8 01:52:36 2015 UTC,"And not just the gate, don't routinely dismount at the same spot anywhere in the ring.  Keep their little brains confused!"
Equestrian,3ch3em,AtomicPenny,2,Wed Jul 8 19:35:09 2015 UTC,"Yes, you can carry a crop. But you won't necessarily need to use it, I find just threatening mine with it is often times enough!  Another thing to consider: make sure when you are actually done with your ride, you are not getting off your horse anywhere near that gate.  A horse I ride over winter break was like that but as soon as I started only dismounting away from the gate (and then walking on foot across the arena to gate) she got over that habit.  The horse I ride normally will still sometimes slow down at the gate if he's being particularly lazy that day.  I usually just always add a little extra leg when I'm riding by the gate and if he's resisting that, I might wave my crop around a bit.  You may want to just start with extra leg near the gate before switching to using a crop, but I would make him work extra hard every time he stops at the gate without permission.  It may extend your ride time but you've got to prevent this from becoming a habit!  Good luck!!"
Equestrian,3ch3em,AuntieChiChi,4,Tue Jul 7 23:51:07 2015 UTC,"It's hilarious how just carrying one can turn some horses into an angel.  My big girl I would do a crop tap and little bump with the spurs right before entering a show ring. ""They are there, behave yourself!"" and then I would never have to touch her once we got going. Don't do the reminder when she was still and you'd be on them both throughout the ride when 80% of her mind inexplicably disappeared lol"
Equestrian,3ch3em,AtomicPenny,2,Wed Jul 8 08:16:52 2015 UTC,"Totally. I always carry one with me and I rarely need it. If I don't have one he knows and acts like a butthead,!"
Equestrian,3ch3em,AuntieChiChi,2,Wed Jul 8 18:08:35 2015 UTC,Recently decided to start carrying a dressage whip for a horse that likes to balk and swamp off his lead...basically do anything to resist going straight and forward...and realized that I have been torturing myself for no reason for the last six months lol!
Equestrian,3ch3em,NeverendingStarchild,2,Wed Jul 8 21:40:03 2015 UTC,I started dismounting away from the gate! Glad to see I was on the right track
Equestrian,3ch3em,NeverendingStarchild,2,Wed Jul 8 03:27:20 2015 UTC,"Good advice here. I would carry the crop in the outside hand to encourage him to move away from the outside/the gate. I would also turn early so that if the horse drifts towards the gate you have the physical space you need to correct the horse before he is at the gate. If the gate is on the side of the arena then ride the quarter line. If the horse is turning his head to the inside, popping his ribs to the outside and drifting towards the outside/the gate then go to your outside aides and ask to a counter bend to straighten him out as you push past the gate. Over time he will eventually learn that the antics don't phase you."

Equestrian,3cez5w,jlm0305,12,Tue Jul 7 11:46:26 2015 UTC,"For the size of the jumps, your position while trotting is more folded than it should be while actually jumping. And then you fold even more as you go over the jump!  Every horse that I have ever ridden would have dumped me at every jump I pointed them at if I rode into it like that. (Alright, confession time, I learned the hard way and used to tilt while riding, until I got dumped at a billion jumps.) Its a team thing, and you've abandoned them to jump it on their own 20 strides out from the jump. Sit up tall, pelvis under, legs on and keep it even. Be a team player!   This is the biggest fault, and a hard one to fix. You have to retrain your muscles into riding tall, and it hurts for a while (I know!) Something that I was taught from day dot was ""ear, shoulder, hip and heel"" - meaning they should all be in a straight line, perpendicular to the ground (on the flat.) You will find that focusing on rotating your pelvis forwards will help most with achieving this line. Right now your back is concave and your bum is poking out, rotating your pelvis forward will straighten your back and bring your shoulders back by default. Really work on a sitting trot even, as it is almost impossible to do (without discomfort) unless you tilt your pelvis forwards.  This will help immensely with your jumping. You will be able to put more leg on without squeezing through your knee. You will be more balanced and less likely to be unseated by a refusal. You will be stronger and able to adjust striding through use of your seat.   Best of luck! I might see if I can find you some before and after pics of my flatwork riding. I was atrocious for leaning forwards! And worked really hard to align myself correctly."
Equestrian,3cez5w,tahlialouise,3,Tue Jul 7 12:23:34 2015 UTC,"All of this. As I was watching the first video I kept thinking, just wait until she rides a stopper. That arab cross looks like a blast to ride, but I think the op would benefit more from a slower, lazier horse where she has to sit up and ride."
Equestrian,3cez5w,ChickenDerby,4,Tue Jul 7 12:46:01 2015 UTC,"Yup this. Also, just to piggyback off of this. Its hard to see from the low quality and the shakiness of the video, but I've noticed OP, that your lower leg looks lose. You need a better base of support. Riding without stirrups will help strengthen your leg and its something that everyone can benefit from."
Equestrian,3cez5w,AmarilloByMorning,3,Tue Jul 7 13:21:00 2015 UTC,"Going along with this you also drop your hands. Every jump you let your hands fall down (in come cases pull back on the horses mouth) which is bad for the horses balance. In the air you have complete control of the horse so any shift in weight is going to affect them. That being said you want to release your hands.    There are three basic rein releases: long crest release, short crest release and automatic release. All three are acceptable when performed correctly. Which one you use depends on where you are in the development of your jumping position (your balance, base of support and timing), how educated and talented your horse is and how complex the questions are in the courses you're jumping. In developing their own personal style, some advanced riders choose to use one particular release more than another, but every rider should learn how and when to use all three types.  Keep in mind that no matter which release you're using, the goal is always to protect your horse's mouth without shifting your weight in the saddle and throwing him off balance. This means that your arms your hands, elbows and shoulders must move independently of your body while your hips stay balanced over your heels. Also, in all three release types, your rein length should stay the same before, during and after the jump. - See more at: http://practicalhorsemanmag.com/article/use-the-right-rein-release-for-the-job#sthash.7pbjWL0o.dpuf"

I was supporting myself with my back rather than my core, and it was KILLING me (and causing my butt to poke out behind me, kind of like yours). 15 of these held for 10 seconds each to start helped me get strong enough to do more advanced core exercises. My riding improved dramatically."
Equestrian,3cez5w,buckerupbuttercup,1 point,Tue Jul 7 23:46:08 2015 UTC,Thanks! The way you put it actually really helps. Using my core more makes more sense to me than tilting my pelvis.
Equestrian,3cez5w,SGSHBO,1 point,Wed Jul 8 00:16:15 2015 UTC,"Pilates is awesome for building up core strength for riding. Yoga (and just stretching in general) is also really good. Focusing on your core, and not just crunches, will really help with your balance."

It has continued to heal bit by bit with no sign of soreness or infection. I decided not to have the vet out as he seems to be in pretty good shape and unbothered by it. The biggest challenge is keeping it cleaned out so it doesn't trap more debris. Our best guess is that he had some sort of foreign body make its way into his skin (a parasite, ingrown hair, a sticker, etc) that left room for dead skin and debris build-up. There is a new photo of the hole to show its progress. It may be hard to see but it has become less of a hole and more of a shallow indent. Bonus pic of Bentley alive and well!

Otherwise, there is no reason not to submit it as many times as you want to whatever category you want. Why? They are looking for people to give them photos for them to use and make money from. It's a contest that is actually looking for free photos for advertising their business and catalog. Usually they would (and do) pay for content, but this is a pretty good advertising scheme to spread their name and also not pay for content.

Equestrian,3c8048,PandaLightsaber,2,Sun Jul 5 19:29:07 2015 UTC,"I don't think you'll have any problems with hurting her worse by trotting her. Usually a vet will have you trot for a lameness exam anyway, unless it's really obvious at the walk.  If she's turned out with some horses it's possible she got kicked or just caught her leg on something. Maybe a fence board or water trough? Is it a hard bump, or can you squish it? It's possible that it's an abscess of some sort, we had a horse get something like that on her shoulder. Started off squishy and got hard over several weeks, finally the vet stuck a needle in it and we found it was an abscess. As for a popped splint, I think you'd have a more obvious lameness. Especially because if the bone went that way, it would be interfering with the deep or superficial digital flexor tendon. Even an inner ligament.  As long as it's not bothering her, I'd say you're okay until the vet is out for teeth. Even if the vet doesn't xray, she may have some ideas on what it is."
Equestrian,3c8048,SirComet,1 point,Sun Jul 5 19:51:21 2015 UTC,"That's true, I guess she would have been fine. The barn manager never got me to trot her and I just assumed that was why.  No nicks or cuts in the area that I could see, the bump may have been there at the beginning, hidden beneath the swelling. It did start off very squishy, it's much harder now that it's flush with her leg.   We've been debating about it being some sort of abscess or she was reacting badly to a bug bite or sting (the bugs have been horrible this year). If it's still there or hasn't popped on its own by the time the vet comes out i'll see what she wants to do with it.   Thanks for your input!"
Equestrian,3c8048,booksaboutthesame,2,Sun Jul 5 20:07:16 2015 UTC,"I recently dealt with a case of fungus on a horse's leg that got to the point of cellulitis/lymphangitis. no lameness, but swelling from hock to fetlock & very, very sensitive to touch. we cold hosed/ice booted religiously, & put him on a course of smz's.   the bump yours has could be any kind of disruption to the skin barrier, leading to infection. as long as the swelling doesn't come back, it might be okay to wait for the other vet to come by."
Equestrian,3c8048,NeverendingStarchild,1 point,Mon Jul 6 20:43:33 2015 UTC,Have you tried a furazone/seran wrap/standing wrap sweat? I think that it is physically impossible to be a bone splint because it is on the so high on cannon bone on is more on the front. I think that there are no fused meta/carpal bones that could pop a splint in that area. The horse probably got kicked or if in individual turnout twisted something rolling or while standing up. I would try to sweat out the swelling and give 10-12 500mg SMZs orally 2x/day but please jog the horse and call your vet. If the horse got kicked and there is a bone chip it would be horrible if it moved into the joint cavity which can happen. Swollen hocks can also be a sign of OCD which gets increasingly painful and requires surgery: https://www.acvs.org/large-animal/osteochondritis-dissecans-horses

Equestrian,3c8048,qwinz,1 point,Mon Jul 13 04:04:39 2015 UTC,"Sorry, I didn't back up my opinion at all. As a sweating technique, sure it is widely used and does its job. I hate it because I see it regularly abused by people, used on anything and everything without thought. Long term use of it on open wounds promotes proud flesh and it is a carcinogen as well. I guess it just scares me that a lot of people will use something without researching thoroughly. The ""omg no furazone"" comment was probably more of an internal cringe and me thinking out loud, sorry shouldn't have bothered posting it as you were suggesting it in the one way I can tolerate it, sweating."
Equestrian,3c8048,NeverendingStarchild,1 point,Mon Jul 13 06:34:06 2015 UTC,No worries. My understanding is that it needs to be ingested in order to be active as a carcinogen in humans. I'll use gloves when applying most products and think its wise for other folks to do so too. If someone was applying Furazone with DMSO without gloves then there would a safety issue because DMSO causes topical solutions to be absorbed through the skin. I do prefer Corona for superficial injuries and Wonder Dust/spray bandages (Blue-Kote or the silver spray I cannot think of the brand name right now) for injuries that are more severe. Your explanation brings up a valid point.

I have four instructors and get lessons only on the weekend, then during the week I have to do my homework. If I'm competing that weekend, I'll get them during the week.  And I get an extreme amount of lessons compared to everyone else, because I want to get very good very fast."
Equestrian,3c6xui,Sarahdragoness,2,Mon Jul 6 15:01:25 2015 UTC,"I only jump in my trainer's presence too but that's more my own preference than her's.  And I'm an adult (35) who only began riding a little over three years ago.  I just don't feel safe or good enough to jump on my own. I barely do anything more than a trot pole on the ground when I ride alone - maybe a cavaletti or two.  Lol, you can imagine only jumping with the instructor and I can't imagine jumping without mine!"
Equestrian,3c6xui,ellevt,0,Tue Jul 7 23:56:42 2015 UTC,"Yeah, she encouraged us to only jump in her presence.   Question:  You don't think that everyone wants to get very good, very fast?  You are blessed with the funds to do that.  That's generally why I don't respect Eventers in the least.   We have an Olympic Qualifying show in my area, and it just looks like a lot of rich pricks that send their horses through, over and down anything, as if they were a sports car, or other material thing.  They get off and hand their spent mount off to a team of paid hands.  It's all rather disgusting to me.   Congratulations on the money though.  I'm sure I will be downvoted to shit for this because on Reddit Equestrian there are a lot of people just like you, but..... that's just not my reality."
Equestrian,3c6xui,ellevt,3,Mon Jul 6 15:06:22 2015 UTC,"What? The? Hell?   I'm broke. And I mean it. Money? What's that? Every dollar goes into the horses. I can't afford to have a trainer every day of the week like you guys can... I get what I can afford.  I've been riding since I was twelve and if you check my post history, I use to be a 1* rider who quit due to confidence problems after a severe fall. What I'm doing - is getting back what I used to have. I have a strong foundation to support myself, I need to find the skills I've buried under years of pain and fear.  I spend literally every cent I have on my horses, and I earn next to nothing. I've sacrificed my life to pay for this and that's my cross to carry and that's fine.   But I don't get any help, I don't have hired hands. In fact, I'm a week behind in my agistment because I just received an unexpected vet bill.   My horse is in tip top shape - if he needs it, he gets it, and I would never risk him. He's competed a lot higher than what I'm riding him at.  So take your attitude and go home. I wasn't bragging. I was envious of you - until you dumped that on me.  What I was saying is that if people here only jumped in the presence of trainers - most of us would never jump, because none of us can afford it, even when we've got our horses in our own backyards and aren't agisting.  Way to drag down an entire sport because you misunderstood what I was saying..."
Equestrian,3c6xui,amousecaledmicky,4,Mon Jul 6 16:06:50 2015 UTC,Seems to be that having super long stirrups over fences would be counter productive to sorting out your position over fences.
Equestrian,3c6xui,churizurd,0,Tue Jul 7 19:20:52 2015 UTC,"Not really. The shorter my stirrups, the more I hollow out my leg when concerned. Especially considering I'm under 65cm.   When getting up and out of the saddle becomes a concern, I will shorten them."
Equestrian,3c6xui,amousecaledmicky,3,Wed Jul 8 03:23:16 2015 UTC,"Huh, that's interesting. I'll admit to being completely ignorant of Australian eventing conventions but I think you're ready and you should have a discussion with your trainer. I'd love to see some pics of you jumping without stirrups- I bet it is a lot more natural. You have very good balance and a natural release, just your lower leg is working against you. I made this to show you-- if your stirrup comes up your hips can come back and stay over your heel. Everything else is perfect. https://imgur.com/bcxJCeS"
Equestrian,3c6xui,churizurd,1 point,Mon Jul 6 06:11:07 2015 UTC,"We do a lot of our low level stuff in our dressage saddles.   We are in dressage saddles/stirrups until 65cm, then we move into a jump saddle.   This is to teach us to stay tall with our bodies and drive with our legs, not with our hands.   This teaches a lot of young riders who want to jump everything like it's 140cm to carry themselves properly and establish a balance that isn't dependent on stirrups.   Over that fence, as I understand it, I shouldn't have even been out of the saddle that much. The jump is really quite small but I got nervous and threw myself up and out, not as bad as I normally do, though!  I understand what you're saying though - when I was eventing PreNov 105cm, I had my stirrups much shorter, but it's been a long time and many falls since then and I have to relearn from the very beginning.   One of my problems is that I used to event to 120cm a LOT when I was younger and then switched to cattle sports, where I used my leg a lot less, so I'm starting again from scratch.  To be honest, shortening up my stirrups is right around the corner, my half seat is almost completely secure and established. I've got one more jump show this weekend before I have a three week break from jumping and in that period is when they will probably be shortened.   I've only been jumping again since March so everything has come along a little suddenly and sometimes we need to stop, take a breathe, and remember that two months ago I was still desperately clinging to my western saddle and refusing to switch my split reins to single reins haha.  Thankyou, you're on the money with the advice but I hadn't really thought my progress was at that point."

Equestrian,3c71k5,HatPants,2,Sun Jul 5 13:48:58 2015 UTC,"I love my tall boots! I can't remember what the make is (they are Ariat field boots), but they are very comfortable after a year of use.   They're a real pain to break in - do not plan on wearing them around the barn for the whole day until they stop giving you rubs on your heels! But once they're broken in, they're fantastic and good for a full day of showing. Also, don't worry if they're tight/hard to zip up when you first buy them, I know I usually can't zip mine all the way up for a few weeks. The leather will stretch and thin out a bit.  They can come up to rated shows with you, they will last a long time. Whereas you can wear half chaps and paddock boots to a rated show, but... I am willing to wager nobody else will wear them (except for short stirrups kids, maybe), and that may very well knock you down a few points for turnout."
Equestrian,3c71k5,Quiinton,1 point,Sun Jul 5 16:53:08 2015 UTC,"I love my tall boots, they are comfortable and better to ride in for me. I just wear my cowboy boots or tennis shoes around the barn and then change into the talls after I'm tacked up. But they also are comfortable for a whole day's wear if you are riding multiple horses or at a show. I have had mine for a year and a half and they show very little signs of wear, and I'm not even that good about wiping the splatter off every time.  I have the Heritage Contour Field Zip, so they are only $90 more than the paddock boots. The fact that you only wear them for riding makes them last longer, and they will transition to rates shows with you next year."
Equestrian,3c71k5,ze1da,1 point,Sun Jul 5 15:23:08 2015 UTC,"I love wearing paddock boots and half chaps for daily riding. I wear the Ariat Heritage III zip paddock boots and the Ariat All Around III half chap in suede. I've found Ariat products to be very long lasting, without costing a lot of money. One thing I love about wearing the paddock boot/ half chap combo is that it gives you the benefit of wearing a tall boot while riding, but you can take off the half chap when you are done. It feels nice to do that on hot days. I find the suede to feel warmer than the leather, which helps in my climate (that's just personal preference, though). I would definitely recommend Ariat paddock boots and half chaps!"

I love them both so much. The quantum crown is incredibly comfy and totally worth the cost. The challenge is not as comfy but durable and also worth the cost.  For breaking in, wear your boots zipped half way down until they have dropped."

Equestrian,3bz6f3,horseyanon,21,Fri Jul 3 09:47:07 2015 UTC,"On a horse who is conformationally sound where you will only be walking your horse should be fine. I would just keep on eye on him during the ride for signs if he's happily managing or needs a little break, but I would go for it.  I weigh about the same as you and was my geldings only rider ever. My gelding is almost 17hh and weighs about the same as your boy, so a much less stocky build. Put a friend on him once who weighed about 200 lbs and my gelding was fine being led all around. The initial reaction when he got up there was akin to, ""WTF Fattie! Lay off the cheesecake!"" but he didn't struggle at all with the easy task of walking."
Equestrian,3bz6f3,AtomicPenny,6,Fri Jul 3 11:30:36 2015 UTC,"What you'd be asking of your horse with having your friend ride is probably no more strenuous than your usual rides, maybe even less so. I'd definitely ask him to be careful when getting on not to thump the horses back and to use a mounting block or fence to save pulling sideways as an inexperienced, unfit rider might do when mounting. The 15-20% rule, from my understanding, is more performance riding related. I wouldn't use that as a reason to prevent a heavier person from enjoying a leisure trail ride."
Equestrian,3bz6f3,callho,11,Fri Jul 3 14:49:18 2015 UTC,"As a point of interest, I am around 215 lbs. in this picture. http://i.imgur.com/tUOdXmP.jpg Please forgive the awful saddle pad :s. My horse was 15.2hh, and 19 years old in that picture. I was riding a couple of horses a day and none came up lame or sore, though I do routinely have them done by chiro and message therapist preventatively because of my weight. Might be helpful if you could warm the horse up a bit before he gets on and maybe do a few back stretches afterwards in case his balance (not so much his weight) was unsettling for your gelding. He is a lovely looking horse, though, and I think it is totally valid to be concerned for his well-being. Along with what others have said, play it by ear and keep the workload easy but a healthy, fit horse shouldn't have much trouble walking around. Standing still is the hardest for them when baring weight."

Equestrian,3bz6f3,AtomicPenny,1 point,Sun Jul 5 02:59:20 2015 UTC,"I'm jealous!! I have a 24"" inseam, it's made finding a dressage saddle near impossible. (I ended up taking my current one to the saddle maker and having about 4"" of the flaps cut off :( )"
Equestrian,3bz6f3,cornisgood13,5,Mon Jul 6 14:29:55 2015 UTC,"From all I've read/heard over the years, a horse should not carry more than 20% of its body weight, ideally closer to 15%. Including saddle and clothes your friend would come up to at least 23% of your horses weight, which is slightly worrying. But then again, your horse won't have to trot, or jump with him on his back, and you're planning on taking breaks.  Honestly this is mostly up to you. If you're not comfortable with the idea of your friend on your horse, I would advice against it, but I doubt your horse would suffer any great consequences if you went on one trail ride together. Regular rides would be a different matter.  He's a pretty little fellow, I hope you have fun together, whatever you end up doing :)"
Equestrian,3bz6f3,kosta_kaylee,4,Thu Jul 9 13:46:50 2015 UTC,"More important than the weight of your friend, is your horse's build, strength in the back, and ability to balance himself correctly under a rider. If he is fairly in shape, and not terribly green, he really should be okay with that amount of weight for a short ride. Teach your friend to move with the horse lightly and to sit in a bit of a half-seat. This way, his full weight is not pressing down on your horse's back and he will be a lot more comfortable for the ride. I have a feeling he will be able to carry it fine, just pay attention to his communication with you and make sure you are listening if he tells you he is done. :)"
Equestrian,3bz6f3,qwinz,2,Fri Jul 3 10:43:31 2015 UTC,"If the trail isn't very difficult and you don't go out on a hot ass day, I don't think it'd be a big deal.   He's going to be a bit stuffed onto your horse though, I'm 6ft 5in and my horse is 16hh. I've ridden smaller horses and I always felt out of place but, thats just what it is I guess. (Just my 2c, everyone is different)  Above all, your horse is gonna tell you if he's to heavy. If his ears don't pin back, he doesn't sound like he's stressing out and he doesn't send your friend to the moon, you're fine."

Equestrian,3bz6f3,omgmypony,1 point,Fri Jul 3 10:36:36 2015 UTC,"I wonder if you could put on a heavy backpack and slump in the saddle a bit first, to just see how your horse reacts.  The horse should be fine physically, but some horses might let you know that they don't like it (bucking, laying down, and biting have all happened in my experience).  This happened this past weekend with one of the most reliable horses I've ever met - gave a little buck right after a very heavy rider was put on him.  It wouldn't have been a big deal for an experienced rider, but with people who don't know what they're doing, that could be very scary."

Equestrian,3bz6f3,dunmorestriden,-5,Fri Jul 3 15:04:53 2015 UTC,Too heavy. And too long.  full grown men used to be 180lbs. Fat ropers getaway with it because the horse works for 9 1/2 seconds.
Equestrian,3bz6f3,horses_fart_on_me,5,Sat Jul 4 17:15:20 2015 UTC,Yes I'm sure the ropers never warm up their horses or sit on them while they wait. The horses can take their riders weight because they're all QHs built to rope. A stocky QH can pack way more that a thoroughbred of the same weight.
Equestrian,3bz6f3,IRaceBarrels,1 point,Fri Jul 3 15:26:18 2015 UTC,"Actually folks rope on anything with four legs. Thoroughbreds rope as well. Guessing you were going for sarcasm with the sure they never warm up comment. Don't shoot the messenger cause I'm not saying what you want to hear.  I shoe lots of rope horses,  and my close friends rope damn near daily.  The horses that do it are generally broken.. sore ribs, backs, necks and legs. Quarter horses are stoic and work through pain, not to be mistaken for unbreakable."

It's all in the upper thighs, the horse should be moving with your post, not you with their gait. Tighten the abs and the thighs, think back like you're sitting in a recliner and push forward with your hips as you come up. Sorry i can't grab you any videos right now, but Sally Swift's book Centered Riding is great for visualizing and overall riding."

Equestrian,3bwoyy,katemf,2,Fri Jul 10 20:14:28 2015 UTC,"This will come with strength, I did that for so long when I started. An exercise you can do is stand for 2 beats while trotting. Like a normal post is up down up down, do up up down up up down. Remember to sit back and take breaks because this is crazy hard at first!"
Equestrian,3bwoyy,hunter3617,2,Fri Jul 10 20:51:34 2015 UTC,"There's also nothing wrong with doing a smaller, slower trot than you normally would while you figure out the rising trot! Your mare's movement should be facilitating the posting, instead of you having to play catch up. I always used to visualise pushing my hips towards my horse's ears so you're not going directly up and will be able to follow the movement."
Equestrian,3bwoyy,misssarahjane,2,Thu Jul 2 22:31:14 2015 UTC,"Tense your body and feel how you bounce out of the saddle twice, as the left then right front hit. You want to use the first bounce to push you out of the saddle, by pushing up very lightly with you legs, then relax and gently sit back down when you feel the second stride.  Pick a point at eye level in front of you and keep your body pointed at it, so you don't lean forward, and imagine your pivot point is actually mid-way up your thigh. Your lower leg shouldn't move, but by trying to pivot above your knee, you will keep yourself from going any farther out of the saddle than you have to."
Equestrian,3bwoyy,qwinz,2,Thu Jul 2 23:48:42 2015 UTC,"Have you learned two point yet? It's a lot easier if you learn to two point, which uses all the muscles you need to build up without causing you to slam onto your horse's back, and THEN post. That way, you're moving in a controlled way from the sit to the two point and you'll be more steady and confident. I'd definitely start there!"
Equestrian,3bwoyy,TheBostonLady,2,Fri Jul 3 04:02:01 2015 UTC,"this is incredibly educational  I know they are on a simulator but it is a great visual for you. watch the first part too, but rising starts around 3:00"
Equestrian,3bwoyy,NeverendingStarchild,2,Fri Jul 3 04:27:29 2015 UTC,Think hips to hands and whenever the hindquarter pushes you out of the saddle your hips just unhinge and swing forward. Careful not to let them swing too much so engage the core and sit longer than you stand.
Equestrian,3bwoyy,horses_fart_on_me,2,Fri Jul 3 05:31:59 2015 UTC,"When I post the trot, I ride the down more than the up. For me, the up is easy. I just let the natural spring of the horse's step lift me out of the saddle then I control the down. This prevents me from posting too high and allows me to truly sit a half step and activate my seat. Has your trainer gone over diagonals yet? The basic idea is ""rise and fall with the leg on the wall."" Until you feel like your posting is consistent don't worry about posting with the horse's inside or outside leg. However, it is helpful to isolate the forward/back movement of whichever foreleg is easiest for you to feel and most up/down according to the rhythm. Long story short, let the horse do the work and follow the horse's movement so that the posting looks relaxed and natural. Has your trainer gone over the two point position yet (or maybe you know this from western riding)? Lots of time in the two-point will help you with staying balanced when your seat is out of the saddle. Good luck!"

If it was only once, and he seems completely comfortable & himself since then, I would keep an eye out but not stress over much. Maybe he took a funny step, or stepped on something that hurt so his down transition was off. Did you check the bottom of his hoof to make sure there was nothing stuck/he didn't step on something?"
Equestrian,3by2w5,shark_kitty,1 point,Fri Jul 3 03:12:13 2015 UTC,"Yes I checked his feet and they were clean.

Equestrian,3by2w5,qwinz,1 point,Fri Jul 3 03:36:22 2015 UTC,"Is turnout an option for him? Moving around would be best, if he is in his stall he might develop more muscle stiffness. Their bodies are pretty good at healing themselves given the space to freely move and stretch. If you are concerned he might be really goofy, I understand that. My mare degloved her leg and I was afraid to turn her out for that reason. Honestly though, let him work it out if you can. He should calm down especially if there is grass or hay there to think about"
Equestrian,3by2w5,qwinz,3,Fri Jul 3 04:12:28 2015 UTC,"Hey, I read you gave him some bute for his discomfort. That's good that you made him comfy but until you know for sure what happened, I would not give much more bute unless he is in excruciating pain. It could cover up a potential symptom or pain that could be helpful in diagnosing it. It sounds like he may have just pulled something when transitioning down.   What kind of stretching exercises do you do on the ground before lunging? Is he green? what is his workout schedule like? how long have you had him/has he been in work? My mare needs to be thoroughly stretched in both directions and have her topline and back stretched before lunging. I would definitely stretch him daily even when not riding him (treats help to make it a fun little daily game that they come looking for). I could help you with some exercises if you wanted.   I would give your guy a hand walk every day for the weekend and if he is still off on monday have a massage therapist or body work practitioner come out and see him. If you only have a vet available that is fine, but I am always hesitant to call one out for muscular/skeletal issues. They can really only provide xrays or drugs at this point and it doesn't sound like he needs either. A good chiro or body work session does wonders."
Equestrian,3by2w5,carbonarbonoxide,3,Fri Jul 3 04:06:26 2015 UTC,"All these things. Don't give bute until you've diagnosed the issue because if you call the vet/chiro and nothing is hurting they can't see it as easily. Analgesics also can make them likely to hurt ""it"" worse or hurt something else because they feel too good!  I like chiro/bodywork professionals because they tend to be cheaper as a ""first pass"" diagnosis and a vet will typically say things like ""I see a lame stifle, let's inject the stifle"" without figuring out that the stifle hurts because the pelvis is tweaked/misaligned, so you're out a bunch of money without even fixing the root cause. My chiro taught me a ton of stretch/massage techniques to use at home, and they're great!"

Are you lunging him in polo wraps for support? Please make sure you are lunging him on a big circle that uses the entire end of an arena to prevent injury."
Equestrian,3bxswu,iambierdo,9,Fri Jul 3 01:13:35 2015 UTC,"If your trainer is not echoing what everyone here is saying, especially the over jumping and jumping ahead, then it's not you, it's your trainer.  These things are really hard until you have someone to point out in real time when you are doing it wrong, and (more helpfully) when you get it right, so that you can focus on the feeling of doing it right.  Once you get that feeling right, then you can focus on everything you should managing on the approach and departure of the jump.   Trainers that make you feel awesome every time often aren't worth your time. Trainers who make you feel like a total amateur loser are often worth the money, work, frustration and tears you will spend because in a year or two, when you earn their respect and praise, you know you deserve it. The first step to becoming good at something is accepting that you are not good at it yet. Whether it's being able to canter around the arena or grand prix jumping, we all have something we are not good at yet."
Equestrian,3bxswu,ze1da,3,Sat Jul 4 04:35:57 2015 UTC,"My trainer makes me feel awesome every time, and I think if you can shut up and listen, that's how you will feel every time. My instructor is really good at ripping me apart and then building me back up so I feel better than ever, even if we spent the entire lesson fixing my elbows at the walk. But they shouldn't be gold starring everything you do either."
Equestrian,3bxswu,showmebevelle,3,Mon Jul 6 07:04:52 2015 UTC,"lololololol.... hahaha! Oh my, thanks for that one! I will have you know that I back talked my trainer exactly one time. He tore me a new one, after that, incredibly effective yelling at and establishment of military like authority, I have never had a problem with 'shut up and listen' as you so wonderfully put it. I adore him, don't get me wrong, but easy lessons, or lessons where I feel like I 'nailed it' are few and far between, and I love it that way. My trainer always lets me know that I am progressing quickly, and that my horse and I are making great strides in our training, but the carrot always moves. Most of the lessons end with me feeling like I learned tons and at the same time frustrated that I couldn't get a handle on the exercise that we topped out on that secession. He almost always makes sure we fail to some degree at something in dressage, or pushes us until I feel the tendrils of doubt creeping up in show jumping(which has made me very good at keeping them in check).   But that's what I want from my lessons, I do not need to feel like a winner, I want to progress quickly and get as much as I can out of my training."
Equestrian,3bxswu,ze1da,2,Mon Jul 6 15:37:31 2015 UTC,"Oh you should probably know I wasn't chiding you, it was more for OP... If she's actually reading these.  I had a trainer that made me quit, she nearly killed me with her dangerous decisions and constant bullying, and I don't want anyone to feel like they need to pay someone to abuse them."
Equestrian,3bxswu,showmebevelle,12,Mon Jul 6 16:01:10 2015 UTC,"What a nice big ring!  I think saying to just critique the actual jumps rather than the in between is an issue since with jumps this small especially, the in between is the most important part and is really contributing to issues you are having over the actual jumps. That being said if you strictly just want a critique of your position over fences this is what I see:   Jump 1: You encouraged that large gap by throwing your body. If you kept that nice tall seat and settled your horse there would have been a whole extra step there.  Jump 2: If you balanced up to the fence and sat a bit lighter and kept a soft hand during and after the fence the distance could have worked and the fence would have stayed up.  Jumps 3 & 4: Kind of hard to see from those angles but look similar to the first jump.  Jump 5: You're over jumping here and then land a bit too heavy in your seat and with your hands. Try to just lighten up a bit by sinking your weight into your heels when you land and stay tall without leaning back.  Jump 6: Also kind of hard to see but looks better! You just need to sink down into your heels and soften.  Jump 7: Same as jump 5 but this is a fair bit of an improvement from that one :)  I think the biggest thing to work on is balance, settling, and softening your hands without throwing your body. Especially with little jumps, you just need to let the horse jump with a soft hand. Throwing your body forward will just result in them jumping poorly and landing in an unbalanced heap on the other side. Once you get the balancing and settling it will make your job look and feel much nicer and easier! Keep up the hard work, I know what struggle it can be to come back from after awhile!"
Equestrian,3bxswu,ConfundusCharm,11,Fri Jul 3 02:07:42 2015 UTC,"In a previous thread I asked if you would like a critique, you said sure, I critiqued.  https://www.reddit.com/r/Equestrian/comments/30drs4/jumped_90_cm_yesterday/cprptt5  I agree with 'shh's and 'charm's responses. You absolutely need to develop balance, security, and feel. And if you were my student I would pull that back to flat only and poles/cavaletti, you are a punishing rider and it's a large disservice to the horse. Being defensive and acting as if everybody is picking on you doesn't help matters either.  ""Ignore the in between"" is also a giant red flag. Jumping is essentially flatwork with obstacles,  the ""inbetween"" is 90% of it! That needs to be on point before jumping.  We all have things we can work on. Like George Morris said, ""I wish I could have another go around, I'm just scratching the surface of this sport."" Nobody has said anything to be mean, people say things to help your horse and your self, and point out dangerous habits.""  ""Yay! Gold star!"" type responses are not helpful. If your trainer is that sort of person I would consider a new trainer, or at least look at the occasional lesson or clinic elsewhere for a fresh perspective. A lot of the things you are doing (hauling on his mouth) are cardinal sins of jumping, a year is a long time for her to have mentioned that to you."
Equestrian,3bxswu,AtomicPenny,16,Fri Jul 3 11:20:17 2015 UTC,"The most glaring problem is that you're sitting up too soon upon landing and catching your horse in the mouth. I'm not going to sugar coat this, it's something your trainer should have caught because you're doing it over every jump and it's punishing your horse. Your lower leg is stable, which is great, but you're jumping ahead of your horse too much (leaning over the fence), no stirrup work would fix this.   Honestly I think your vid is a classic example of an intermediate beginner jumping too soon. Your flatwork needs lots of help: horse needs more balance around corners, before jumps, after landing, and needs to know simple or flying changes that look clean before you ever begin over fences work. Right now it looks like you're just kinda pointing him where to go and ""yee-hawing."" I don't intend to sound mean, but at this level I'd rather see you doing poles and developing a more balanced horse and a better eye for distances. Raising the fence height is the easy part and shouldn't be rushed."
Equestrian,3bxswu,shh_im_not_here,5,Fri Jul 3 02:42:00 2015 UTC,"I've agreed with the flatwork or at the very least cavaletti height jumps from your very first post. You aren't supporting your horse through the jump and every time you fall back you are most likely pulling on her mouth. That's going to make a sour horse in the end and get you refusals if you keep raising the height. At this point if your trainer is really telling you that you are ready to jump or jump this height you should really find another trainer, but because I doubt you'll do that here's a few things that have helped me when I was beginning to jump. Be rhythmic and correct in your canter before you even begin to jump, and when you do jump trot the fence and canter out. Work on a lot of two point. I was able to two point for 30 minutes both in canter and trot before I considered my muscles to be strong enough and trained enough to hold me up over a fence and on the backside. Grid work is good for you and good for your horse. When I was jumping ahead of my horse my trainer made me do cavaletti sized grids of three xs or one x and two verticals until I stopped. I did hundreds and hundreds of grid jumps. Neck straps help remind you not to pull on their mouths of you have that problem.   None of these will really fix the problem without a decent trainer though and if you don't know what you are doing you're going to end up getting hurt or ruining your horse. I'd really really strongly suggest you spend a month or two only doing flatwork and dressage, work with a dressage trainer. Then you might be ready to actually jump"
Equestrian,3bxswu,mrflossin,5,Fri Jul 3 23:20:54 2015 UTC,"I agree that she sits back too soon, but I don't think she's too beginner to jump at all. Actually, OP, you don't look too bad to me. Distances could definitely use some work, but you'll get that as you jump more and start to see it. u/shh_im_not_here's suggestion of poles would help with this too.   As for the sitting back too soon, I would suggest trying to hold a full half seat (perhaps even holding onto mane if you need it) for 1-2 strides after the jump. Once the movement becomes more natural, you won't need to hold it for so long, but you won't be punishing the horse, as u/shh_im_not_here says. Just make sure you're not riding a horse who will drag you if gets extra rein."
Equestrian,3bxswu,lux_ehterna,10,Fri Jul 3 02:53:54 2015 UTC,"I disagree. I was formally trained in h/j so that's the viewpoint I come from and obviously going to be my bias. No one is ""too beginner to jump"" because you can point a horse at a fence, kick, and if it clears it then voila. However, I give my critiques from the POV of formal training, so just because she and that horse can jump 3,4,5'+ doesn't mean they are doing it safely. Again, all of us advanced riders have been at this stage and made similar if not the same mistakes. Jumping a horse too much is wearing on the joints, no point in having them jump when you get so much done with flat and pole work."
Equestrian,3bxswu,shh_im_not_here,-4,Fri Jul 3 18:24:47 2015 UTC,"I just worry that she can't work on release over trot poles (or cavalettis really, at least not well), and that's her biggest issues. Overall I agree with your assessment, though, especially with working on balance and using trot poles to develop an eye for distance and. I think focusing on smaller jumps and shorter courses (maybe even just single jumps) would be a good place to start to work on the release."
Equestrian,3bxswu,lux_ehterna,6,Fri Jul 3 19:31:07 2015 UTC,"You definitely can work on release over poles, trotting and cantering. You absolutely should practice it on the flat until you are fully competent, and only then introduce jumping into the mix. Otherwise you learn bad habits and it'll be much harder to relearn the correct methods.   That's how I learned at least."
Equestrian,3bxswu,alis_volat_propriis,9,Fri Jul 3 19:41:25 2015 UTC,I'm an eventer and full agree. I drill classical dressage on my horses and then jump. Good flat work will save your life when it all falls apart.
Equestrian,3bxswu,showmebevelle,4,Sat Jul 4 04:32:40 2015 UTC,"I am going to add my opinion here. Let me start by saying I am by no means a Grand Prix rider. My riding is a constant work in progress, as is ANY rider's.   I recently had a trainer tell me this ""Jumping is 100 steps. 8 - 15 of them are jumps, the rest are flat work."" So you telling us to 'Just critique the actual jumps' makes me want to have you do nothing but flatwork for 6-8 months. I am not here to sugar coat anything for you. A critique is supposed to be constructive and helpful. If you want a confidence boost, a critique is not the place to get it.   Your horse, first of all is an angel who is obviously trying very hard, but really is not meant for jumping. He is strung out and all over the place with the exception of the last fence. His jumping style is very similar to a deer's where he just throws himself over it hoping to make it over. From just the first few fences, I can tell he hangs his knees quite badly and at such a low height this is a big warning sign as it can lead to dangerous situations.   I agree with everyone saying that you are coming back too early in the saddle. I have the same problem, especially when I get tense. Think about staying 'down' in your 2 point (also known as half seat) for 1 stride after the fence. This will get you the feeling of staying folded over the entire fence. If it helps, think about pressing your knuckles into his crest until 1 stride after the fence as well. Also, I know it sounds elementary and basic, but try using a jumping strap around his neck (I used an old stirrup leather) and every time you come up to the jump, grab ahold of it and keep your hands on it over the fence. It will save your horse's mouth and it will get you to stay closed over the fence.   I do agree that poles in 2 point until you can stay balanced the entire time. You ARE on your way there, I just think you need more time and MORE FLATWORK. Working without stirrups will also really really help you."
Equestrian,3bxswu,CaliGirl16,3,Sat Jul 4 02:44:02 2015 UTC,What is going on with the horse that it is cross cantering after every fence? You are definitely interfering with the jump by not establishing a consistent rhythm and holding to the base. However that could be a sign of a more serious lameness. I would get the vet to check that out.
Equestrian,3bxswu,ellevt,3,Sat Jul 4 12:36:13 2015 UTC,"I believe he is some type of gaited breed, maybe Tennessee Walker. I own a Spotted Saddle Horse (TWH) and she also trots and canters. When she's tired or going down hill she gets strung out, and if I really don't lay it on thick which direction I want her to go after a jump she will cross canter. It's something we've battled with for a long time."
Equestrian,3bxswu,nopesalot,5,Sat Jul 4 23:33:29 2015 UTC,"Working off of what a few of the others have said:   Jump with the horse not for him.  I also have this tendency when I'm nervous, but it is hindering, not helping your horse. It prevents them from getting the opportunity to rock back and bring themselves more up. It almost forces a flatter jump. Any horse can do that over a low fence, but it will cause serious issues as the height increases.  On the flat... relax your elbows! You're not letting your horse move, and causing it to hollow its back. Speed control comes from your body and half halts. Your should be encouraging your horse to move into your hand. Even for forward horses, you need to ride leg to hand. Push them up into your contact, and controlling the rhythm with your seat and aids. This is a huge must. I spent a year with my speed demon ottb with dressage training before I jumped her for this very reason. Proper form is important for both the horse and rider. The goal if to be able to release your contact without having to worry about your horse taking off. When your reins get longer, a horse that is moving into the bit will reach forward for the contact, not run away. This is HUGE for the 'oh crap!' moments in life where an unexpected long spot/distance forces a rein drop/slip to avoid catching their mouths. If reins are all your control, all hell breaks loose. If they're just your fine tuning aids, regathering is faster and calmer.   Over fences:   Release! This point has been stressed, so I'll say no more. Sit back and wait. The horse comes up first. Don't try to jump for it. Land in your stirrups. Your butt seems to hit the saddle before the hind legs are on the ground. This causes your horse to drop its back, and will add up to a lot of rails caught by the hind feet.    Flatwork isn't a bad thing. It is an essential part of riding, and excelling in your flat work will only benefit your jumping. It is the fundamentals, and I'd highly recommend you work with your coach to build those up a bit more. Jumping is fine now and then, but right now it should be an occasional/for fun situation while you work to improve your flat. The improvements you need will not come if your rides are all over fences. But you fix it on the flat, your jumping will start to improve at a rate you probably don't think is possible! I speak from experience on that one!"
Equestrian,3bxswu,Cataclysmic_Paradigm,2,Fri Jul 3 14:09:58 2015 UTC,"I agree. I event full time now, and I jump twice a week, flatwork/dressage three times a week, and do ground-work/horsemanship one day per week. Over all, I do very little jumping compared to anything else."
Equestrian,3bxswu,showmebevelle,-2,Mon Jul 6 07:13:21 2015 UTC,"You are very vertical over the fences. Bend forward from the hips a little more, so you're shoulders are farther forward and lower. You already keep your shoulders back and head up well. Keep that up! You're also a little behind the motion (your horse moves, then you do). Try to relax your hips and anticipate, so you move with her, instead of following after her."
Equestrian,3bxswu,hunter3617,1 point,Fri Jul 3 06:07:41 2015 UTC,"Youre seeing something good here, however, youre missing the bigger picture. she isnt in sync rythmically with the horse. so any adjustment she makes to her angles wont help because she will still be jumping ahead"
Equestrian,3bxswu,jasmin356,-1,Sun Jul 12 18:50:58 2015 UTC,"I think everyone is being a little harsh. I dont think the OP want's to be a grand prix rider here. She just wants to have fun and maybe do a little competition.   I think you're okay to begin jumping, sometimes its nice for both you and your horse to have a break from going round in circles. Looks like your horse enjoys jumping. Release with your hands and work from there, work on trusting him/her with less contact and giving and taking reins.   More long term work on collection and rhythm in the canter and the jumping will really improve."

Equestrian,3btve6,Red_Mare_,2,Thu Jul 2 02:46:28 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the encouragement, /u/deliciouslysaucy , /u/carbonarbonoxide and /u/AtomicPenny !  I talked to the vet again today. The granule things should arrive at the vet facility by Wednesday, and KC should hopefully go through surgery either on Wednesday or Thursday. Apparently the surgery is not super invasive. His incision will only be about 2 centimeters in length. And he can come home after 48 hours.  He wants KC to be on stall rest for awhile, and I explained to him that KC tends to get upset if he knows his usual pasturemates are nearby and he can't get to him. So I'm going to talk to my trainer, who also happens to be the owner of the barn I board at, about going through with her idea of moving the two mares into one of the pastures that has two gates and two shelters and fencing off one gate and one shelter to make a small area within the pasture for KC to live in while his usual pasturemates live in the rest of the pasture. He won't be able to follow them around, but they can still talk over the fence and be fed near each other and such.   Fingers crossed that all goes well!"
Equestrian,3btve6,NeverendingStarchild,1 point,Fri Jul 3 10:47:35 2015 UTC,"If your horse is really distressed about the stall rest then ask your trainer for an opinion regarding light sedation. Especially for later in the prognosis when the vet will most likely want KC off of stall rest and hand walked daily, a few CC's of ace administered orally might be a good idea. Certainly better to play it safe than have the horse get loose, run around and possibly re-injure himself (or you). Dex is also a good mild sedation that will take the edge off but it is administered via IM or IV."
Equestrian,3btve6,NeverendingStarchild,1 point,Tue Jul 7 18:08:36 2015 UTC,"Yea, that is something I'm considering. When my mom's horse was badly injured, we used ace tablets to keep her sedated to take her outside for her walk. She had whiplash in her neck from getting kicked in the head, and we were on strict orders not to pull on her head at all, but we needed a halter and lead rope on her to take her out of her stall to walk her. The ace tabs were essential.  I'm hoping that if we set up the pasture so that he has his own chunk in with them, but separated, that he won't freak out so much. If he does, then we will see about sedatives. He's always fine when you take him away from his pasturemates to work with him, it's the staying by himself and not being allowed to go back to them that stresses him out."
Equestrian,3btve6,NeverendingStarchild,1 point,Tue Jul 7 18:43:07 2015 UTC,Ace is pretty good for nervous travelers too. I think its like the equine counterpart to Xanax. I understand wanting to minimize his high blood pressure from separation anxiety but would be nervous about stall rest not being true stall rest.
Equestrian,3btve6,NeverendingStarchild,2,Tue Jul 7 20:32:54 2015 UTC,"Yea, we actually got two tubes of an ace gel in case we couldn't get him to go into a trailer without it to get him to the facility he's at right now. We will most likely use ace to get him back home, because he is so nervous about trailers."
Equestrian,3btve6,deliciouslysaucy,1 point,Tue Jul 7 23:39:46 2015 UTC,"Keep the ace handy! When I've had horses come back to work after 6+ months of stall rest, I think it is a good idea to use some ace for the first couple of rides. No one needs to assume an unnecessary risk. That's the only time I think it is acceptable to ride a drugged horse and safer than the animal not having some ""help."""
Equestrian,3btve6,carbonarbonoxide,1 point,Wed Jul 8 16:50:44 2015 UTC,"Yea, I agree. With this situation, KC will only be rideable if everything goes basically perfectly.

Approximately 50 Caspian horses (which are endangered) are significantly underweight and obviously neglected.  Local and state authorities refuse to step in; likely because the family that owns the horses are wealthy, powerful and prominent members of the community. This abuse has been occurring since 2009, and I have exhausted all possible avenues to remedy this urgent situation privately. I hope this petition and recent media coverage will push authorities to finally take action.    If you're into Facebook, there is a site with more info.  If you're into phoning, on the facebook site there are numbers to call.  So tragic. I've relatives up there that told me about this. The parents of the woman who owns the horses are wealthy.

Equestrian,3bpjy2,sageinventor,7,Wed Jul 1 19:39:13 2015 UTC,"The other poster did a good job of explaining. I'll show a couple examples. None of these photos are mine, just a quick google search. Far from perfect examples because I'm a bit limited on time. :) Almost always, you want to show the power and grace of the horse. At certain points such as when he is in a downward motion, it makes them look less graceful. There are a TON of exceptions depending on the sport and what the photographer is looking for, but this is sort of the basic.  Trot- Usually you want this when the front legs are as extended as possible/ in the air a bit.  Good  Good  Good  Good too  Less Good  Less Good  Canter- You want to show the uphill nature of a horse's canter if possible. A canter is a three beat gait with the a back leg striking by itself, then a diagnal pair of legs, then a front leg. The best photos are done when the first back leg is striking off and the front is off the ground. When three legs are all touching but the last front leg is still off the ground is also nice.  Good  Good  Less Good  Less Good  Less Good  Jumping- You want the photo when the horse fully round his neck and back. His back legs can be touching the ground still or in big jumps he can be completely in the air. The photos don't look very good when the horse is just taking off or over halfway past the jump. Sometimes landing shots look good though. You also usually photograph jumps from an angle up front.  Good  Good  Less Good"

Equestrian,3bpjy2,daydreams356,3,Wed Jul 8 00:10:52 2015 UTC,"Generally you want to catch a horse in the ""forward energy"" part of the stride. For example, at the trot, you want to catch the horse when its front legs are reaching out to take the next step, and not when the leg is coming backwards. I can try and find example photos if you are interested, I have lots of bad timing photos.   Another thing to focus on is the moment when the hind leg is reaching furthest under its body. It shows the most power."

Equestrian,3bt1tx,mrflossin,2,Thu Jul 2 16:17:18 2015 UTC,Go through the water on the cross country course and come out the other side instantly sexy LOL  Oooo boy! Did you catch a glimpse of those water logged panties!?!
Equestrian,3bt1tx,AtomicPenny,3,Thu Jul 2 17:10:01 2015 UTC,"Better yet, get dumped in the water by your spooking horse and have to walk back with your underwear glowing through your pants. The ultimate walk of shame"
Equestrian,3bt1tx,mrflossin,3,Thu Jul 2 18:01:59 2015 UTC,"White suede-seat breeches are the way to go here for sure.  They hide pretty much everything, they aren't see-through and they help keep you in the saddle (yay now we can do a better sitting trot!). They're like a triple threat, dude. They're epic. Go buy them. Nao."
Equestrian,3bt1tx,ChemNerd23,1 point,Thu Jul 2 00:25:24 2015 UTC,"Romfh breeches are the best. Like Pikeur, but about a third as expensive!   On another note, you could also get compression shorts and wear them under your breeches. They would also help make you look slimmer as well as prevent any sort of underwear showing! I do it all the time."
Equestrian,3bt1tx,horseyanon,1 point,Fri Jul 3 09:54:24 2015 UTC,"Animo are really see through despite the hefty price tag - avoid. Pikeur, Cavallo, kingsland, Dainese are all great - many brands have a choice of fabric - go for a heavier one. (Disclaimer - I am in the UK and you might have different brands and rules to here!)"

They were the cheapest I could find (I'm never going to wear them except at one or two shows per year so I didn't want to shell out). They are quite a heavy material, not exactly sweat wicking but definitely not see through. That + nude thong and I've never had a problem. They aren't my favourite breeches but they serve their purpose!"
Equestrian,3bt1tx,pandapotamus,1 point,Sun Jul 5 13:21:13 2015 UTC,Have you looked on premier equines website. I have a pair of theirs and they are good for me.
Equestrian,3bt1tx,Clairoee,1 point,Wed Jul 1 23:18:12 2015 UTC,"I have OnCourse (everywhere) and Neddy's (ebay) white breeches, neither are see through. If you get soaked though good luck.

I have these here! but there are some here also :) Like the ladies below me, white underwear! Nude ones can stand out in all white jodphurs, so invest in white thong/boy shorts."
Equestrian,3bt1tx,bearsornobears,1 point,Thu Jul 2 00:45:53 2015 UTC,"Honestly, it doesn't really matter how nice the breeches are, you will need to wear nude or white underwear under them.  I find that the really thick breeches are just uncomfortable anyways.    I ended up buying a pair of FITS Wunderbreech.  They are essentially short leggings you can wear under your breeches that will act like spanx and smooth you out, and they make your breeches not see through."
Equestrian,3bqs9q,mikamikira,10,Wed Jul 1 11:56:07 2015 UTC,"I think it's very irresponsible to declare that a trainer is using rollkur based on a single photo. Any horse can drop behind the contact for a few strides but you as a rider can't just throw the reins at them, you have to maintain that connection to the bit.   You really need to see a video or see in person that the horse is consistently and forcefully being ridden behind the vertical. A nice buildup of foam is good, as long as the horse is relaxed. If they are furiously chewing the bit they are probably stressed.   I'm not denying that rollkur is a serious problem and a very unethical way to treat horses. But lots of people see more contact than they would personally like and call it rollkur. That's just not the case."
Equestrian,3bqs9q,ellevt,5,Wed Jul 1 21:41:14 2015 UTC,"Completely agree with this. There are horses who do not seek out the contact and consistently go behind the vertical. Some of it may be past training, some of it is conformation. It is not ideal, but it is also not abusive.   There are also some horses who do better worked ""Deep Method"" as a warmup. It is not for every horse - for example, it is not for those horses who hide from the contact, and it's not for every trainer, either. It is controversial, but working horses slightly behind the vertical and deep can be a good warm-up to get their backs up and working before bringing them up to a ""show"" frame. This is what I'm talking about.  Unlike rollkur, horses who are being worked in deep method are not being forcefully held in this frame. It is a lot easier for these horses to work over their topline in a deep frame rather than up. It is very possible that Charlotte was warming up in this method. Carl Hester certainly does it, as does many other top riders. If you ever have the opportunity to watch a warmup ring for a CDI, it is fascinating.   And of course, there are always lots of armchair dressage ""experts"" on the internet who like to sit back and lambaste the top riders."
Equestrian,3bqs9q,diamonte,1 point,Wed Jul 1 22:27:03 2015 UTC,"Absolutely agree - ""deep and round"" is not the same as rollkur. The position of the head is not the only measure of good or bad. Also, the way horse breeding has evolved, dressage (or show jumpers for that matter) are now super elastic and really stretching over the back is easier for them than for the more old fashioned types. Head exactly on the vertical is a correct competition frame, but in training it is fine to position the head/neck differently. All that matters is that the horse is relaxed in the jaw, loose over the back and behind the saddle and stepping under behind."
Equestrian,3bqs9q,GoodLordAlmighty,2,Sat Jul 4 16:59:30 2015 UTC,"Thankyou for your in depth answer. I wasn't saying that she uses rollkur. I asked the same question on a video and someone was all over how much of a sell out Charlotte is now, and how she uses rollkur now. I personally can't see any signs of it in any of the videos I have watched. Thankyou for clearing it up."
Equestrian,3bqs9q,ellevt,6,Wed Jul 1 22:06:46 2015 UTC,"I think Charlotte Dujardin is a lovely,  sensitive rider. And when I watch Valegro I don't see anything but a freakishly talented horse who obviously loves his work.   There are always going to be armchair experts with negative opinions"
Equestrian,3bqs9q,faiths_river,1 point,Thu Jul 2 00:54:59 2015 UTC,"I watched a recent 3 day clinic she was at locally for me. She is ALL ABOUT THE HORSE. Getting them up and forward and letting go of the contact and then taking it up again. I would in no way says she uses rolkur.   She is a very light and sensitive rider. It was amazing watching her teach and ride versus some of the other top riders I have seen. She truly is very down to earth, hilarious, and modest. She is not arrogant or full or herself.   I should also add I am not usually a start struck person. I don't care who you are or how amazing you are... just another person. I was at a complete loss for words when she signed my hat and wrote short reins wins gold medals."
Equestrian,3bqs9q,faiths_river,3,Sat Jul 4 02:33:30 2015 UTC,"Half your luck. I wish I could meet her. Although, I do get a little star struck. From the inteviews I've watched she seems all about her horses and when she talks about retiring Valegro, she starts tearing up."
Equestrian,3bqs9q,Sarahdragoness,1 point,Sat Jul 4 02:36:25 2015 UTC,She told us a story about how this lady in their barn is 70 something and hacks blueberry down the road and out in the fields!!! All the time at home! That they take them out to be horses and go for a gallop out on the trail. They don't just work them in the arena.   It was amazing!  I would do any clinic she is ever in anytime anywhere!
Equestrian,3bqs9q,ryou1,5,Sat Jul 4 02:43:17 2015 UTC,I don't think so. I usually look for the tell-tale blue tongue and chin to their chest. Lots of horses foam when they are working the bit and not in rollkur.
Equestrian,3bqs9q,darkaseternity,7,Wed Jul 1 13:00:29 2015 UTC,"Building on this - there are actually bits that encourage salivating because many horses will relax their jaw while doing that, which is really encouraged in the dressage world.  Nose to chest and blue tongue are really the best way to tell."
Equestrian,3bqs9q,shh_im_not_here,1 point,Wed Jul 1 13:48:33 2015 UTC,"Thats what I thought. Valegro usually foams, though, he's just one of those horses and he seems to love it, from the videos I've watched; he's always nice and chilled. I've watched her riding her younger horses and there doesn't seem to be any signs of it there either."
Equestrian,3bqs9q,sweetcatofmine,0,Wed Jul 1 22:03:16 2015 UTC,"From what I've been taught (and I'm not an expert!), ideally the horse should have ""foam lipstick"". However excessive drooling (foam all over chest etc) is a sign of tension so could be caused by rollkur."
Equestrian,3bqs9q,KittenVicious,2,Wed Jul 1 14:01:58 2015 UTC,"This is Rollkur. From what I saw of Charlotte and Valegro there wasn't any Rollkur, he was pretty much on the vertical if not slightly in front. So no, horse's can foam when there isn't even a bit in their mouth, it just means they are activating their mouth."
Equestrian,3bqs9q,ClassicHoof,1 point,Wed Jul 1 21:17:04 2015 UTC,"Dressage terms newbie here...can someone explain rollkur in an simple terms for me? I know it is a training method used to promote excessive bending and is controversial and sometimes abusive, but that's all I know."
Equestrian,3bqs9q,NeverendingStarchild,2,Wed Jul 1 15:16:09 2015 UTC,Here's a graphic that explains it well
Equestrian,3bqs9q,AtomicPenny,-2,Wed Jul 1 17:03:41 2015 UTC,"I've heard that saliva occurs due to the saliva glands being simulated too much, this is why rolkur always occurs with tons of saliva. Some horses salivate more than others, but seems to be a recurring trend that salivation under the vertical is way too much compared to over the vertical.   Also, try swallowing spit when your head is tucked in to your chest, it's not easy!"
Equestrian,3bqs9q,NeverendingStarchild,-1,Wed Jul 1 17:23:50 2015 UTC,"When the horse is overflexed, the profile of the horse's head will not be perpendicular to the ground at a 90 degree angle. The horse is not on the bit at all, it is actually behind the bit. Mouth foam is not a sign of stress but excessive foaming of the neck from sweat is a sign that the horse is being worked aggressively."
Equestrian,3bqs9q,AtomicPenny,7,Wed Jul 1 16:54:35 2015 UTC,"Just to clarify, anytime a horses head drops behind vertical doesn't mean it's rolkur."
Equestrian,3bqxl0,Sarahdragoness,1 point,Wed Jul 1 12:53:22 2015 UTC,"For what it's worth, I don't have any specific experiences using them for trails, but I showed my horse in my trainer's dressage Orthoflex saddle and loved it.  She seemed to move much better underneath it, and I didn't notice any difference between it and any other saddle in terms of ride-ability. I've read that they only flex a centimeter in each direction, so it's important to make sure it would still generally fit your horse. There's some controversy out there with them rubbing or pinching, but I've never had any of those experiences."
Equestrian,3bqxl0,cclolinger,2,Wed Jul 1 13:45:22 2015 UTC,I ended up with a Circle Y Just B Free. Thank you both for the input.
Equestrian,3bqxl0,imakemyownluck,1 point,Mon Jul 6 11:30:04 2015 UTC,"Love them! I have two orthoflexs, both western. Never had a sore back after rides with them in eight years. Make sure that the panels flex properly, because when they lock up, they're not fit to put on a horse anymore. They can also sit a bit high off the horses back, so not super easy to feel the horse. Other than those things, I'm very pleased!"
Equestrian,3bog2o,am-weiser,4,Tue Jun 30 21:15:02 2015 UTC,"Hooray! It's wonderful to be able to share that with your partner. I can get my husband in the saddle maybe once a month for an evening pleasure cruise, but that's about as far as he goes."
Equestrian,3bog2o,blooheeler,3,Tue Jun 30 22:46:53 2015 UTC,"My husband likes to feed them, and see them buck and fart in the pasture. He's got zero desire for anything beyond that haha"

Equestrian,3bpl18,Confidence_Trickster,1 point,Wed Jul 1 14:07:35 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I see that too. he is known to be really stiff/immobile in his lower back, but stretches on a regular basis have improved his range of motion a TON."

Equestrian,3bpl18,shh_im_not_here,1 point,Wed Jul 1 04:03:38 2015 UTC,"He is only 8. Recently diagnosed with arthritis in his front hoof. Did ex Rays, farrier is working to correct the angle. I took him to the U last month or maybe 2 months ago now, and they found fluid on stifles and hocks. I have a follow up on July 10th.   He usually gets worse the longer the session is. There's a good window in the middle where he feels more loose, but then I think he ends up getting worried before he gets stiff.  He lives outside 24/7. Pasture during the day and a paddock with other horses overnight. He does not run and play hardly at all. He likes horse'a but prefers just playing with his mouth. So I would say he doesn't get enough movement outside, even though there's plenty of room"
Equestrian,3bpl18,theycallmehavoc,1 point,Wed Jul 1 04:17:16 2015 UTC,"My first impression was a stifle injury, I'd be curious as to what the vet finds on the follow up."
Equestrian,3bpl18,NeverendingStarchild,1 point,Wed Jul 1 21:23:06 2015 UTC,He did find fluid on his stifle at the last visit. not so much an injury but just wear. his hips arent perfectly level so that makes things not sit right
Equestrian,3bpl18,NeverendingStarchild,2,Wed Jul 1 21:28:02 2015 UTC,"To me it looks like he is sore in his hips and lumbosacral region. Have you ever had him adjusted? If he has arthritis in only one foot, then he has likely been compensating and has thrown his back out of alignment."
Equestrian,3bpl18,carbonarbonoxide,1 point,Wed Jul 1 15:15:46 2015 UTC,Yes this has bee a long journey. His back is worlds better than it was before. I consider his back pain free now that he bears more weight on his front door than he used to.
Equestrian,3bpl18,NeverendingStarchild,1 point,Wed Jul 1 15:56:37 2015 UTC,"I see the shortness up front. From my experience, based on whatever foot the horse looks like it is coming up short on then it is usually the opposite foot that is giving the horse trouble. In this case I am going to say that the arthritic hoof is his left front?"
Equestrian,3bpl18,NeverendingStarchild,1 point,Wed Jul 1 17:36:57 2015 UTC,The x Rays showed major arthritis on his right front. And from the outside you can see the hoof is angles very different. No arthritis showed on the exray of the left front. But the vet did say it looks as though he will end up having navicular in both front feet 6 months to a year from now
Equestrian,3bpl18,NeverendingStarchild,2,Wed Jul 1 18:21:38 2015 UTC,Yikes. I've known some horses that remain serviceable as beginner lesson horses even with long-term navicular. There was no jumping these horses and times where bute and a couple of days off were needed but as trail rides and w/t/c mounts helped many kids fall in love with the sport.   Did the vet suggest going to bar shoes or some other form of corrective shoeing?
Equestrian,3bndn4,crazycrazycatlady,13,Tue Jun 30 16:42:43 2015 UTC,"I don't think there's such a thing as a perfect horse, just like I don't believe there's one soulmate floating around in the world for each person.  Did you see this horse with his new owner on the sale barn's facebook page? Because of course they're going to say everything is going great, it's good marketing for their business.  This is all very new, the horse is barely even settled in yet.  Who knows what kind of quirks they haven't discovered yet, and he's still basically riding off the same program he was in at the sale barn.  Wait until 6 months or a year in, he may start acting up once his turnout situation is different, his exercise level changes, his feed changes, or so on.  Here is a GREAT article about how beginner safe horses become not-beginner-safe once they're taken into a new environment and how incredibly common it is: http://www.horsecollaborative.com/the-beginner-safe-horse/#   If you spend any time on horse message boards or social media, you’ve read stories about horses that were sold to someone as “beginner safe” and then, within a few months, started offloading their riders regularly, became hard to handle, stopped doing things they used to do peacefully, etc. Frequently the new owner posts to complain that the previous owner must have drugged the horse, because they don’t understand any other way that the calm, mellow “packer” they tried out has now turned into a nightmare.   Notice they say ""within a few months"".  This horse has just barely arrived in his new home, they barely even know him yet! And believe me, the only horse without quirks is a horse that isn't breathing.  Even if somehow this horse was the horse you were destined for and you missed him, I promise you there's nothing he had that you won't find in another horse equally deserving and in need of your love.  I've worked with probably a few hundred horses at this point and I've never had the well of love run dry.  Some have not been my cup of tea but I've never ever ever come even close to reaching my fill and feeling like there were no more horses out there that could fill my heart with joy to work with them.  The fountain does not run dry, you will always find another horse to love.  If you've ever had dogs or cats that have passed on, you can never replace their memory but providing a wonderful home to a new dog or cat just brings more love and more adventures into your life.  It's not the same as with your lost pet but it's not any less either.  Your heart expands to hold both in a special place, it's not just one or the other.  It's normal to get butterflies when it comes time to make a decision, especially a big financial decision on a living animal, but I would heed your gut reaction and especially your reaction after speaking to an experienced horse person who knows you.  The lost horse you're mourning now is a dream horse.  You're thinking about all the wonderful things you could have done together but of course you're not thinking about all the things that could have gone wrong.  It's like dreaming about Mr. Right--he doesn't exist. A real horse is not perfect and I promise you this one isn't either.  They will all have their strengths and their weaknesses.  You just didn't have a chance to learn his, and his new owner doesn't know them yet either.  Give it some time and let these feelings pass.  I think you probably should focus more on the fact that you followed your gut when you had second thoughts.  Better to make your leap into horse ownership when you're excited and your gut tells you you're making the right choice than taking the plunge when your friends, head and heart are all telling you to think twice."

Equestrian,3bndn4,deliciouslysaucy,4,Tue Jun 30 17:36:22 2015 UTC,"Everyone posts the good stuff on social media. Not many people want to share with the world about the nagging NQR gait asymmetry or the huge spook that unseated them or persistent bad ground manners or what have you. And even fewer people get over the honeymoon with a new horse so quickly. So take it all with a huge, huge grain of salt.  Even if he was essentially a perfect fit (which I'm not so sure of, the way you describe it), you'll find more great horses. It's still a buyer's market out there. And it's better to regret a horse you didn't buy than to regret a horse you did buy!  Hang in there and good luck putting this guy behind you so you can look forward to whatever your equestrian life has in store for you next!"
Equestrian,3bndn4,daydreams356,3,Tue Jun 30 23:27:14 2015 UTC,"Don't worry. If you didn't have that gut feeling, he wasn't the right horse for you. While I've ridden plenty of good horses I didn't connect with immediatly, my two best ones were instant love. My first horse I first saw standing siloutted in a barn door with his head up. Most gorgeous thing I've ever seen in my life. Turns out he was for sale and in my price range. Best decision I ever made, best horse I've ever ridden. Miss him every day. While he was a bit crazy sometimes, he never refused a fence and would do anything in his power to protect me from coming off of him. Couldnt have asked for a better horse to grow with.  There are a TON of good horses out there that will be safe and help you grow as a rider!"
Equestrian,3bndn4,lilbootz,2,Tue Jun 30 21:40:03 2015 UTC,Thank you. I guess what gets me is that I wasn't nervous about him. I was nervous about whether my job would allow for the time.

One will never know, but you might have even dodged a huge bullet! The sellers may have been dishonest about some crucial piece of information and your instinct picked up on it.   Source: I made a deposit on a horse to use to give beginner riding lessons. I felt really nervous leaving the place and tried to ignore it. The seller had put a lot of pressure on me to make a decision. I called my barn owner on the way home to tell her the news, and she realized she knew the horse. Apparently, this horse had gotten away from his handler twice and wreaked total havoc at a show because he saw a striped blanket he didn't like. I immediately called the seller to tell her I couldn't buy him and she got REALLY ugly with me (probably because she thought she had finally ditched this crazy horse). Bullet dodged!!! I cancelled my check first thing in the morning. Best bank fee I ever paid :P"
Equestrian,3bnd9x,AnnaTrocity,3,Tue Jun 30 16:40:03 2015 UTC,"I had my mare in a fly sheet with a neck cover that could attach to a leather halter. it was tough enough to withstand fence rubs and had the bonus of keeping her mane neat. The slinky aren't really durable enough for turnout IMO, they will just snag on the fence. you alsocould try a Kool Koat with a neck cover."
Equestrian,3bnd9x,intergalactik,2,Tue Jun 30 17:15:17 2015 UTC,"The neck slinkies are useful if you're trying to keep show braids nice and in for more than one day. Something I have noticed from prolonged use is that a mane fungus tends to develop that causes the mane to fall out. A fly sheet might be better but if s/he rubs alot then it will likely be destroyed. The serious breeding barn I worked at used electric fencing and had no trees in the paddocks/pastures so other than redesigning the property, I am not sure what solutions to offer."
Equestrian,3bnd9x,NeverendingStarchild,2,Tue Jun 30 23:10:39 2015 UTC,"My horse wears a fly sheet with belly band and neck cover all summer long. To keep the neck cover from coming down, you can either attach it to a breakaway halter (more effective but more chance for rubbing) or a fly mask (more gentle on the face but way easier to come off). My boy wears this one and he's currently on a really lush pasture, so I attach the neck cover to his grazing muzzle. It lasted all last summer (May-August) without getting holes and just now got a small one on the haunch a couple of weeks ago. I highly recommend it as a durable, affordable fly sheet."

Did not end up being very successful as he managed to keep getting them undone and they just didn't hold up.    I just braid now.  Keep the braids loose-ish at the top and tight down the hair.  Redo often and keep the skin from getting irritated or itchy.

Equestrian,3boty4,NeverendingStarchild,3,Tue Jun 30 23:31:40 2015 UTC,That's not untrue but the order was placed online and I am 100% sure I spelled it correctly (this is verified in my original order verification and by both of the people I spoke/complained to). Then for both calls they definitely had the right name. They both read it back to me off the original order and immediately admitted it was the manufacturer's fault. Really I did everything I could and take no responsibility whatsoever.  Also even if it had been a phone error (and again it was all text so it couldn't have been) How do you mix up Zed and 'A' and subsequently S with D.   On the other hand these letter pairs are both next to each other on the keyboard. That tells me that someone at the plant or wherever they make these typed it in hastily and never bothered to double check it.

Equestrian,3bl6s6,carbonarbonoxide,1 point,Tue Jun 30 12:36:54 2015 UTC,"I think it's just a regular 5-point... The d-ring placement on the saddle makes it look strange.   As an aside, how do you like it? I've been considering ordering a PS of Sweden breastplate because I like their bridle, am intrigued by the martingale clips, and the Harwich breastplate I have is about to die."
Equestrian,3blroj,blueanecdotes,5,Tue Jun 30 06:33:59 2015 UTC,"It's been a while since I jumped, but  you seem to be jumping ahead of your horse, if that makes sense. Over anticipating the jump. If she decided to refuse, you'd be going over the jump without her. The opposite of this would be jumping behind, where you anticipate a refusal.   But like I said, its been a while. Take what I say with a grain of salt."
Equestrian,3blroj,BirdLadySadie,7,Tue Jun 30 10:41:54 2015 UTC,"I agree. She looks Arab-ey, and they tend to have quite the unique jumping style (rounded deer jump on crack may be an apt description?) and my guess is OP felt a bit launched out of the saddle one too many times. Need to wait for it though! Long leg, soft hand, and go with that motion instead of fighting or anticipating it. You can feel her jump coming for sure! Let it cue you up out of the saddle. Lots of 2-point, caveletti, and small grid work to help develop that feel. And watch those hands, don't be stingy with that crest release.  In general, OP, you ride very perched. I want to grab your hips and just pull your whole body backwards in that saddle a few inches. I am a bit sway backed and just by conformation naturally sit more forward, but we have to fight it. Scoot back in the saddle a bit so you're sitting in the center, and then tilt your pelvis back underneath yourself more (less crotch, more seat bones). Shortening your stirrups to make that hip-knee horizontal leg length longer will help to stabilize you in that further back position, and will get your whole leg more underneath you. Then heels down, let your leg stretch softly around her, and let her footfalls guide your movement instead of riding above her."
Equestrian,3blroj,AtomicPenny,2,Tue Jun 30 12:29:47 2015 UTC,"I did feel quite launched, she gets a bit nervous and quick when she's without her friends. The release is something I'll need to work on, definitely.  I'll try scooting back and relaxing, I think part of the problem is her being naturally fast so I always feel the need to have a harder contact than I probably should."
Equestrian,3blroj,BirdLadySadie,1 point,Tue Jun 30 16:18:08 2015 UTC,"I see that she had he hands rather close to the bit, but I wasn't sure if she had a short neck or was a bit loco at the approach.   Also, this may be trivial here, but your reins look really long, like you might catch your stirrup or boot, boot laces, socks, girth, saddle.... Or heavens forbid even maybe a stray hoof could get in it. Crazier things have happened. Maybe a pair of pony sized reins? For any discipline, I always try and use as little tack as possible. Less to go wrong, less to clean, less between you and your horse.   I always ask myself, do I really need that breastplate/martingale etc? Or do I just think it looks good?  Does my horse actually need this harsh bit? Or do I need to work on communicating with him with other things than my hands?   It could be that your mare has a long, relaxed neck on trails or whatever, I'm just tossing that out there."
Equestrian,3blroj,BirdLadySadie,1 point,Tue Jun 30 16:18:13 2015 UTC,"She gets a very short neck in canter, and was also a bit quick. She's refused this fence before, so I got a little nervous. Her neck lowers a lot when she's relaxed and I let out the contact. I'll try loosening up next time I ride.  Yes, the barn I ride at doesn't really have pony reigns (I may just go out and buy some), so I tried to get the smallest ones I could. I considered knotting it, but I wasn't certain if that would be allowed. The schooling reigns (they're rainbow!) are a much better length for her."

Equestrian,3blroj,cornisgood13,6,Thu Jul 2 01:02:16 2015 UTC,"Eek! you're jumping really far ahead of your horse. Your butt should still be over the saddle instead of in front of it, and your knee at the knee roll instead of on your horse's shoulder. You're looking up and forward though, which is good. It also looks like your horse took the jump at an odd distance and I'm happy to see your hand has moved forward instead of catching your horse in the mouth. You look like you're trying so hard to sit up straight but you are FULL of tension. Elbows should be just touching the front of your hip bones instead of tightly clamped at your side and your hands should be just above the withers (your horse has his head up quite high here, which makes hand placement awkward--for long term work, I would work on encouraging your horse to stretch out in a longer and lower frame). Happy to see that your back is fairly straight though, not arched. The saddle looks like it is really far forward and encroaching on your horse's shoulder, which places your body too far forward and upsets the horse's balance. You are also sitting really far forward on the saddle. I know it's hard when you're riding someone else's horse and in someone else's tack, but I think both you and the horse would benefit from a properly sized and placed saddle. Very similar to #1, jumping really far out of the saddle and ahead of your horse. In this one, your elbows are again clamped to your side--try to release over the jump, just a simple crest release will be fine as long as you don't throw away your contact completely. Like number one, you seem to be looking where you want to go, which is GOOD! Your feet are a little bit far into your stirrups though, keep them under the balls of your feet for a little extra security.  Your mount looks most relaxed in this picture, and so do you, phew!! Your legs are a little far out in front of you though, and so are your arms and hands.    Hope this helps, good luck! Edited for clarity"
Equestrian,3blroj,daydreams356,2,Tue Jun 30 12:26:32 2015 UTC,"I need to work on staying behind and with her and staying in the saddle when jumping. Up until her, I've only been riding larger horses and it looks like my eq has suffered.  I was also trying to slow her down at that point to prepare for the next jump, but yes I see that. I will work on encouraging her to stay lower and stretched in canter and at shows. I'll look into the saddle problem, and for now I'll set it a little further back and try to fix my spot in it.  Yeah my release is basically nonexistent on that one. I'll try to step down into my stirrups better and hopefully that will keep them on the balls of my feet.  That picture is the only one not at a show haha, she definitely relaxes when shes at home with her friends. Okay.  Thank you!"
Equestrian,3blroj,SSGraham,2,Tue Jun 30 16:32:22 2015 UTC,"I didn't read through all the critiques on here, so if I'm a bit repetitive, I apologize.   I am going to start from the first picture and work my way in order.    You and your horse are absolutely buried to that oxer. Something that if I saw as a spectator, I would have cringed. Since you got in so deep, your horse is now jumping over her shoulder and hanging her knees quite badly. You have jumped ahead (I don't blame you.) and gotten your entire body ahead of the pommel. Had your horse hooked a leg on that back rail of the oxer, you would have gone flying over her head. Your leg isn't bad, however the lower half from your ankle down has slid behind the girth. This is also caused by you gripping and pivoting on your knee. If the heel comes down and forward, your knee will naturally come off the saddle a bit. You want your heel at the girth with your heel down and your toe slightly out. Your release isn't awful for such an awkward jump, but I almost feel it is a bit restrictive. Your horse is trying to use her neck for balance, but she has hit a wall with your hands. I read some where below that she gets nervous and starts rushing when she is in the ring without her friends. This will take time and patience to correct, especially the rushing of fences. Also, ride her as much as possible without any horses in there with her, or just with one friend and stay at the other end of the ring. Things may get ugly at first, but she needs to learn to do things away from the herd. As far as rushing fences, you both can benefit from some low gymnastics. She needs to work on backing off the fences and you need to work on your body control. Low cross rails, no larger than 2' at the cross. This may seem elementary, but you both need to go back to basics for a while. As you go up to the gymnastics, get in your two point and grab some mane (Again elementary, but even Grand Prix riders grab mane!) and just wait for the jumps to come to you. If it helps, use a jumping strap around her neck to get the muscle memory of how the release is supposed to feel. The line of gymnastics will make the horse naturally back off and think about what they're doing over the fences. It will help you better control your body position and learn to wait for the fence to come to you.  Your flat work looks pretty good. Your horse looks very distracted and her head is very high, but I'm not going to comment too much on your horse since she is not yours and critiquing her isn't fair. Your lower leg is in a great position here, a contrast to the first picture where it is behind the girth, your leg is where is it supposed to be which is at the girth. I would like to see your heel down and flexed a bit more, but it is level which is better than up.  I have a feeling we are going to see a trend here. Your hands are in your lap and your arms are very restrictive. I have a feeling it might have something to do with your horse being quite a hot head and not really focusing on what is happening on her back. You should be able to see your hands in your peripheral vision (not by looking down). Right now they are too far into your lap. Perhaps shorten your reins just a bit to get them out in front of you. Your back is flat and your eyes are looking in the direction you want to go, however, if your intent was to go right shortly after this picture was taken, your horse should also be looking right, which again tells me your horse has lack of focus and attention to you. If your horse is like this, really use your new inside leg (in this case, would be your right leg) and really force her to look in the direction you will be going. Notice I did not say pull her head to the right. Bending in the correct direction comes from the leg, not the hands.  This picture is a much better spot for both of you. The fence is low so I don't really think this mare is trying very hard since her knees are uneven and she isn't really using her neck over the fence at all. You are jumping ahead of her again, although slightly better, you still have your entire center of gravity ahead of the pommel. You need to bend at the waist more and stick your butt out behind you and once again, wait for the jump to come to you. All you are doing right now is standing over the jumps. Your release is still restrictive and your hands have barely moved up her neck. She does have a short neck, so I'm not saying throw your hands to her ears, but you do want your hands and you elbows further out in front of you. I had a trainer in college who told me to exaggerate my release by putting my elbows on my horse's crest every time we jumped. It is very over exaggerated, but it will get you to feel what the release is supposed to look like.  This is the most relaxed picture of the two of you. The only things I can see about this picture is you are leaning quite a bit to the inside around this corner. You are not riding a motorcycle. When you go around a corner, think about lifting your inside shoulder and turning through your waist. Your hands are better here and not as restrictive or tight, but now your outside hand has come up above your inside hand. Ideally, I would like to only see the inside hand because they should be even with each other.    Other than that, you have quite a bit of homework to do, but keep at it and your improvement will come. (It is not going to happen over night!)   Edit: apparently reddit thinks its formatting is smarter than me."
Equestrian,3blroj,cornisgood13,1 point,Tue Jun 30 17:00:31 2015 UTC,"I'm not entirely sure what 'buried to the oxer' means, I assume too far back? So I should let my knee come off the saddle, okay. I will work on my release and pushing my hands forward more. I heard from my instructor that her previous owners rushed her at fences, so I think that's become a habit. I'm currently attempting to fix that by trotting fences and half-halting before we get to the jump. Right now I'm taking group lessons but I've wanted to switch to private for a while now, which will help both me and Roxy, and that sounds like it'll be happening in the fall.  2' jumps aren't terribly low for me, the one in the picture is 2'3"". I did grab mane at quite a few jumps during the course, and I do think it helps my balance so I'll keep doing that. Jumping her more in general should also help me because I'll gain more experience and such. She tends to jump better at shows because at home she thinks she can get away with things, so I haven't had much practice actually jumping oxers and such at home.  Thank you! I'll definitely try to loosen my joints in my arms and hip, starting with trying to get her calmer at shows (she's only been to a few so inexperience is part of it). Okay, peripheral vision is a smart way to judge hand position. My intent was to turn right at the rail, so she had a bit of time before she needed to turn, but I do agree I need to keep her attention and bend her even when heading straight.  Yes I thought this one looked a little better. I will definitely work on keeping back more. My instructor hasn't really mentioned it but that could be because the jumps go so quickly. Release I will work on, the one in that picture is really bad.  Yes I realize that is a problem for me, the leaning, and I'll actively keep trying to stay centered and perpendicular to the ground on the flat, no matter where my horse is. Okay.  Thank you!"
Equestrian,3blroj,daydreams356,2,Tue Jun 30 17:51:17 2015 UTC,"To clarify what I meant by 'buried to the oxer' this is referring to the distance you and your horse took off from over the jump. There are 3 different distances: Long, medium (ideal) and short (buried or chipping in.)   Long means you could have fit in another stride before taking off to the jump. Long spots also make the horse jump flatter and have to reach more with their front legs. The horse's back is supposed to round over the arch of the jump, when a horse and rider take a long spot, the arch becomes flat. This is when hitting a rail happens.   Medium means you left what is referred to as 'in stride' or with a balanced rhythm and the jump came up nicely. The arch of the jump is over the center, the horse rounds its back over the jump and reaches forward with its neck. A medium distance also sets the pair up for the correct number of strides to the next fence as the horse is not landing too far out (like after a chip in or short spot) or landing too close to the previous jump like in a long spot. You want a medium spot most often as it is the most comfortable.   Short means you could have left the ground for the jump a stride earlier. Your first picture is a prime example of a short distance. Usually short distances make the horse and rider jump sloppy and it can also be dangerous for both the horse and rider.   A short and long spot are not BAD things, they just take an experienced rider to be able to look good and remain composed no matter what distance comes up."

Equestrian,3blroj,buckerupbuttercup,1 point,Tue Jun 30 06:35:06 2015 UTC,"I'm not going to critique as much as leave a picture of what a pretty proper jumping position looks like, take this one and compare it to your photos as well as the advice you've received form other users here. photo . (she's a bit twisted because she is on a turn) You can see here how she is balanced over the saddle and not ahead of the motion or ""standing in the stirrups"". She also provides an adequate release by following the mouth, she is not balancing on her hands. Put your photos side by side, and you can see where the flaws are in your jumping position. Your flat equitation is fine, but in that last picture close your fingers! ;) I honestly think you would benefit from basic dressage training to allow you to learn how to release the hold you have on your horse's mouth. A proper dressage trainer can teach you other ways to slow him/her down and work with them more effectively, because I see a beautiful horse and rider combo in there that needs a little relaxation to come out and shine :)"
Equestrian,3blroj,buckerupbuttercup,1 point,Tue Jun 30 12:51:03 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the reference. I see how forward I am now, as well as my other mistakes other users pointed out.  She was originally a dressage pony, so I probably need to up my dressage game to match hers. I have already asked my instructor for us to focus on more dressage, but I don't exclusively ride her (she's a lesson horse), so I may not get the chance. I'll try to help her relax if I can. Do you have any good techniques for keeping a horse slower instead of really bunched up and quick, while maintaining a contact?"
Equestrian,3blroj,ellevt,2,Tue Jun 30 16:36:23 2015 UTC,"I actually disagree a bit here. Jumping should NEVER be parallel to the ground unless you are doing 4+ foot jumpers. At low level jumps, a jump should barely be more than a two point position. Anything else is forced and puts strain on the horse's front end. The only purpose to a jumping position is to make sure you aren't left behind, release the pressure off a horse's back to he can round over the jump, and to release the horse's neck so (again) he can round and use himself over the jump. The rider above isn't bad and her legs are good, but is still a bit forced, imo. If you tried to lay over the front of the horse's neck (as most riders who try this), your legs would likely be way behind you.   Here is a video that sort of demonstrates what I mean. The rider right after where I linked (#263) it is doing what I think is more preferable body wise... though he is trying to balance back for the drop ahead. Now watch through the video and look at the different riders. The ones forcing themselves ahead have rough landings and look... not balanced? The ones who don't jump ahead and barely move foward from a two-point you can barely tell they even jumped. Its smooth and balanced. Eventing is a weird example because you are focused more on safety and balance than looking ""right"" as in a lot of hunter rings, but you can get what I mean. It is a good example for jumping an excited horse though! These are pretty big jumps too so you see a lot of the parallel thing but the best riders are smooth, balanced, and not leaning forward on the horse's neck.  I three-day evented up to prelim and trained up to intermediate for quite a while. The people with broken bones and falls in cross country were the ones doing the ""I must be parallel-laying-over-the-horse's-neck"" thing that you see so much in the hunter ring.  For the relaxation, the reins being short aren't helping. You need to relax and be loose yourself and breath. Think about slowing your trot and actually slow your posting and do lots of transitions to help balance her properly. Circles and transitions on a circle are great and not used enough in other disciplines. There is this thing called a ""natural circle"" in a book I read. A lot of people disagree that a small circle is easier on a horse but it can be a great tool to get a horse to think and in my experience its actually quite relaxing for a horse. Here is a link to the idea of it. For my current horse in training, its been a great tool for relaxation. He is a very hot-minded Arabian and any time he rushes I do 5 or 6 natural circles (until I feel him relaxing and stepping under himself) and then work on what I was working on again."

Transitions were the key. Especially the canter to trot transition made the most difference. When I asked her to canter once her gait wasn't how I wanted  (which at first was literally like 2 strides) we transitioned back to the trot. I don't think we did a full ring canter for a bit but let me tell ya...her topline got built, she learned to engage from behind and eventually had a beautiful adjustable canter. We did tons if all transitions as well but for her issue that's the main one that fixed it"

Equestrian,3blcch,AtomicPenny,1 point,Tue Jun 30 04:22:25 2015 UTC,"You want all your transitions to have light forward energy, downward included. Halt is not ""cease all motion!"", halt is ""gather here for what's next""...if that makes sense. Sometimes just adjusting the way of thinking about something can make a big difference.  Can you drive a manual transition? Not slamming down and yanking the e-brake (I've seen cow horses on tv...that's what it looks like in my vast experience haha), it's like feathering the clutch. You are stopped but not touching the brake at all (watch some dressage clips with the halt at X)"

I do drive a manual, I understand why it needs to be gentle but not quite sure how to achieve it after ten years away from dressage. I will ask during my next lesson as well. I think I need to keep him in 'neutral' a bit longer, ie, ready to move off, instead of just stopping and that be the end of discussion until I decide to pick him up again. He switches off a little in the downwards. Am I making sense? It's been a while."

They're usually not the cheapest quote you'll get but IME they've got great drivers and the best maintained rigs of the long haul companies (we see a lot of pro shippers at the facility I'm at, which serves as a home base for several trainers, some of whom winter down south and others use pro shippers for big shows). Equine Express and Bob Hubbard are also generally well thought of among my equestrian colleagues.  Good luck with your move!"

Super professional, reasonable, and take great care of the horses. I trust them completely. Side note - Be sure to watch out for uninsured illegal horse transporters!! I know of one called Warhorse ranch, they are definitely illegal and have actually killed horses before. Best of luck!!"
Equestrian,3bkax1,carbonarbonoxide,2,Tue Jun 30 22:18:03 2015 UTC,"The only pro shipper I've ever use was Brookledge and they seem top notch, judging by some stories I hear (wrong horse delivered, taking up to a week longer than expected, etc). Rate My Horse Pro has a great database of shippers too, and I believe they check licensing."
Equestrian,3bkax1,KittyKatClause,2,Wed Jul 1 00:08:33 2015 UTC,"Another vote for Brookledge! I asked my trainer who asked around her professional contacts too and the consensus was that Brookledge is the standout best. I used them to ship my horse across the country and he arrived in excellent shape. Also if you can afford it, go for the box stall option."
Equestrian,3bid56,pot8o-queen,5,Mon Jun 29 13:50:16 2015 UTC,"Back in the day I was looking for a replacement for my outgrown pony and bought an 18 yo QH/Arab with a been there done that past. Almost didn't go and look at him because the age is just a kneejerk no. He wasn't a beginner horse, wasn't really a schoolmaster although he was quite talented, but was sound, quirky, worked his ass off, and was a sweetheart. We dabbled in absolutely everything and I owned him right up until the end. He was an amazing horse and I'm glad I got to have all those years with him and his no nonsense ways, he taught me a ton those first couple years.  I think sound older guys with a good head on their shoulders, experience, and good conformation can definitely have a place in the world, but rarely is anyone actually looking for an older horse. Older horse you instantly go to A) schoolmaster for a few more years, B) beginner lesson horse, C) pasture buddy for the ""real"" horse. B is out if you say he needs more toward the intermediate side and can be a bit too much, and C is a waste if he's still sound, happy, willing, and able. A is the general direction you need to head. He knows what he knows, and he's had a number of years to know it.  I think your sweet spot could be a lower level amateur adult, or a younger teen in that same transitional stage when I got my old man.  I would post ads everywhere you generally would, and advertise him like every other horse. The stickler being that you do research before actually selling him. Call up the potential owner's current vet, farrier, boarding barn, instructor, etc. Do your homework that they are trustworthy and reputable, not just seeing an easy price tag. It's a good habit with any horse, but especially ones that may need a bit more care or if the whole process is sounding too good to be true."
Equestrian,3bid56,AtomicPenny,3,Mon Jun 29 15:37:29 2015 UTC,"I would agree with this. There are people willing to potentially do maintenance, and to be a horse's last home, that won't be concerned about age and will buy anyway. The friend will just have to understand that they're not going to get a lot of money out of the sale. I know some highly competitive hunter mounts who are rideable and excellent schoolmasters, but at 20 are being essentially 'given' away for a long-term free lease and no money is changing hands."
Equestrian,3bid56,sincerely-sacha,3,Mon Jun 29 16:03:28 2015 UTC,"Exactly what I did. I bought my horse at 17 with some maintenance issues, and he's been the best teacher I could have hoped for.  Luckily, his prior owner was realistic, and wasn't trying to make a lot of money from the sale, but wanted him to go to someone who understood his limits and was willing to commit to trying to keep him healthy and happy.  Someone looking for a non-beginner but well-trained horse can really find a gem if they're willing to accept the trade-off of ongoing maintenance.  I found him through my old trainer, so contacting some trainers who may have students who are looking could be a good starting point."
Equestrian,3bid56,cannes23,2,Mon Jun 29 21:10:54 2015 UTC,"Thank you, that is another good suggestion. I will talk to my old pony club instructor and see if she knows anyone looking!"

Equestrian,3bid56,NeverendingStarchild,1 point,Tue Jun 30 13:01:47 2015 UTC,"I think your sweet spot could be a lower level amateur adult   Absolutely! I bought my first horse in October and I'm 21. He's 17 now and is absolutely perfect for his age. I'm competing at local levels right now and as my riding progresses, I outgrow him and aim for A and AA rated shows, I'll search for a new horse. But my current ""oldie"" was a perfect match for me considering my riding skill/experience as of now."
Equestrian,3bid56,spud_simon_salem,2,Wed Jul 1 20:58:27 2015 UTC,"He could be donated to a college program if you are concerned about him ending up in the wrong home. Is he sound or just serviceable up to 2'6""? I've known many horses that can jump 3'6"" into their twenties with maintenance as simple as Adequan or Legend which is why I ask. I think the harder sell is the fact that the horse requires an advanced rider but is limited to 2'6"" fence heights. It might be better to fully disclose to the potential buyer the reason why he is serviceable up to 2'6"" and maybe market him towards dressage instead. Otherwise, you might be able to find a trainer with a working student program who could evaluate his use as a school horse. Several of my mounts from my youth came into our program less-than-perfect. I would work and show them for a year then they would be rolled over to the school program. Good luck!"
Equestrian,3bid56,NeverendingStarchild,1 point,Mon Jun 29 19:07:58 2015 UTC,Don't know why you were downvoted but yes older horses can absolutely jump the higher levels. My horse is 17 and he's perfectly capable of jumping a 3 ft hunter course. My trainer even said most of the horses on the olympic teams in the 80's were in their late teens/early 20's. I think there's just a stigma against older horses in the community because many people think older=won't last years or older=less resale value.
Equestrian,3bid56,spud_simon_salem,0,Wed Jul 1 21:01:36 2015 UTC,"Probably because I suggested donate rather than sell and because I encouraged full disclosure as to why the horse is serviceable only up to 2'6"". To be marketed as a ""fine hunter"" at the child or adult level, the horse would need to be competitive up to 3' so the OP has really limited options getting decent money while marketing this horse for over fences work.   I totally agree about the stigma towards older horses but there are more horses in their later teens putting in rounds in the GP ring these days then before...I don't know my facts on the 80's Olympic Team but in general it seems like more professionals are seeing a horse's prime as around 13-15 years old whereas in the past a 15 year old horse was already seen as being on the outs. I've found that Legend or Adequan, some Surpass and a really good farrier can keep a horses competitive up to 3' easily into their twenties."
Equestrian,3bid56,GH00S7,2,Wed Jul 1 22:02:28 2015 UTC,Adequan is a godsend. That along with getting my horse's knees and hocks injected really makes him 17 going on 7 haha

Equestrian,3bid56,J973,1 point,Mon Jul 13 01:07:46 2015 UTC,"Not so much a tip, more just my two cents - I bought my horse not knowing all his issues, I've had him for five years. He can be difficult to maintain but he's the best horse I've ever met. I would buy an older horse with maintenance and limits in a heartbeat - just reassuring you that we are out there. I would feel more comfortable purchasing a horse like that as well - the owners would be looking for a good home and would be open about any issues that would need maintenance. No shady business, kind of.  My guy has a forever home. He's a 17 year old OTTB as well :)"
Equestrian,3bid56,ecspj,1 point,Thu Jul 2 02:52:50 2015 UTC,"If he is looking for a semi-retirement home, which it seems that he is, THE LAST PLACES I would be looking would be commercial facilities, riding schools, riding programs, hunt clubs, and especially college programs.   Those all use the HELL out of horses-- multiple riders almost every day--, compared to most private owners.   Look for a low-key, private owner that will be the ONLY person riding him.  He's not a Merry-go-round horse, let the poor thing retire in peace.  The owner may not get as much, but Karma, ya know?   And if a horse needs to be doped or injected in order to do the work, why not just find another horse and let the old guy/gal retire?  I don't know what ""Top Trainers"" are teaching the kids of today, but maybe people need a good old fashioned 4-H leader to talk about good animal husbandry.  F#$#%!"
Equestrian,3bid56,AtomicPenny,1 point,Mon Jul 6 06:12:42 2015 UTC,"He is actually in a semi retirement home right now and he can stay there forever if there are no better options for him. His physical issues currently come from a lack of muscle condition and his mild arthritis which tends to improve with consistent work. He does not and cannot get enough work at his current home due to the skill and comfort level of his riders. No one is looking for a horse to replace him and he just does not seem ready to retire.  No one is trying to overuse or profit off of this horse, just trying to do what is best for him."
Equestrian,3bid56,Sarahdragoness,1 point,Tue Jul 7 01:53:16 2015 UTC,Maybe you could talk to a local riding school or pony club and see if they have any capable teenagers looking for a horse of their own. When my friends sell horses they usually take them to a show and put a sign on their trailer saying the horse is for sale.
Equestrian,3bftbp,MyrtleLoadTheShotgun,2,Sun Jun 28 21:08:34 2015 UTC,I'd say overall well balanced.  Would love to see her in action. Doesn't look real big but size don't matter. Does she get the job done? I'd say if she does don't worry bout perfection. If you want any criticism. ..do more dressage work to build her neck and topline. I think overall nicely built horse. Shoulders a bit straight but as I said...if she gets the job done
Equestrian,3bftbp,IamBre,1 point,Mon Jun 29 02:57:21 2015 UTC,"I agree on all points with /u/IamBre . It looks like you have a really well balanced horse, just work on overall muscling, especially her top line."

Equestrian,3bgskt,shark_kitty,2,Fri Jul 3 13:16:50 2015 UTC,"The only tip I can think of is using a bucket with some oats in it instead of carrots. You can shake the bucket, and hopefully the horse will hear the noise and associate it with food. Works like a charm with our horses. Carrots would probably be harder, since the horse would just be able to smell them once it's close. I hope you find the gelding, best of luck!"
Equestrian,3benko,diamonte,3,Sun Jun 28 15:02:03 2015 UTC,"What are your goals for your riding? I personally place the highest value on connection with a horse because, while I would love to move up some levels and occasionally win at shows, I know I'll never want to be a professional rider.  In my experience, horses that connect with you often surprise you and other people with what they can do with a rider that bonds with them.   If you're looking into riding mostly for fun or competing at a non-professional level, it makes sense to pick the horse you will have a better relationship with. After the thrill of the power and talent of the gelding wears off, will you be left feeling ""meh"" when you go see him because he doesn't gel with you?  That being said, if you're very competitive and want to become a professional (or just want to win all the time because, hey, winning is fun!) It might be worth forgoing the connection to get the more talented partner. I think it also matters what dicispline you're in because that will affect if you REALLY know one horse is better, especially since that mare is young."
Equestrian,3benko,Summer_Frost,2,Sun Jun 28 15:39:57 2015 UTC,"Yep, that pretty much sums up the decision for me. I am kind of a borderline adult amateur/professional in my riding.  I want something to take up the levels myself (with the support of my wonderful coaches and trainers). Where I go from there really depends on the horse.  I have a competitive streak and need goals to work towards. I am a ""mare person"" and generally feel more bonded to them, but I think the gelding and I make a good pair and I love riding him. He is only 5, so they are both pretty young."
Equestrian,3benko,rhapsodyknit,2,Sun Jun 28 15:56:52 2015 UTC,"One of my considerations when horse shopping this winter was what my life plans were for the next 5ish years. Kids are a possibility for me (though certainly not a definite) and if I get pregnant there's a good likelihood I won't be able to ride. With that in mind, I got a mare with the specific purpose of breeding her the same year I potentially am pregnant. Neither of us can be in hard work and either I have a new horse to work with at the end or I have one to sell.   Basically, think about all potential life things, not just horse related, when comparing. It does sound like you're leaning towards the gelding more."
Equestrian,3benko,wntrwhte,1 point,Sun Jun 28 17:10:03 2015 UTC,"Also a good point. I think some of my bias is because the gelding is not time-sensitive like the mare is. If I pass up the mare, it doesn't mean I have to buy the gelding. I can keep shopping if I want, my trainers are encouraging me to shop and they aren't marketing him except by word of mouth right now. Whereas if I get the mare, that means I'm passing up the gelding and any other horses I might come across."
Equestrian,3benko,wntrwhte,1 point,Sun Jun 28 17:41:00 2015 UTC,The mare is not the right horse if you are feeling like you are missing something better by buying her.
Equestrian,3benko,deliciouslysaucy,1 point,Tue Jun 30 10:55:47 2015 UTC,"Although the better horse is in a very different price range than she is, and buying something of his caliber is only possible because my trainers would arrange long-term payments."
Equestrian,3benko,dunmorestriden,2,Tue Jun 30 12:36:00 2015 UTC,"This is my opinion having bought several young horses to bring up the dressage levels - power is one thing but if you're feeling power at training level the horse is not likely to be an upper level horse. They need a certain amount of ""spark"" to be good at the upper levels. The gaits can be developed to some degree, but for example the gelding looks like he will have a nice change but I don't see a lot of natural ability to sit based on this one video.   That combined with known mouth/jaw issues would make me hesitate.   Meanwhile the Andalusian/Lusitano types really don't tend to be anything special until the upper levels because they are great at sitting but the mediums/extendeds are meh. Lateral work is often fabulous, though. I have seen many that I wouldn't mind riding small tour on, at all.   I really don't know your budget range but I'm sure there are other horses maybe between these two extremes out there.   When buying for upper levels I tend to look first for work ethic, quality of canter and walk, aptitude for collection, and a little bit of spunk.   What is the geldings breeding? That can give you a lot of useful info."
Equestrian,3benko,silver_slinky,1 point,Tue Jun 30 10:54:19 2015 UTC,"I have seen that gelding sit beautifully. He had one session with a trainer known for teaching piaffe/passage and it certainly proved he has the talent for collection. (Yes, playing with those things as a five year old is unconventional, but he's an unconventional horse and the mental challenge was good for him.) His discomfort with the mouth is certainly another issue, though.  He is by Lingh and out of a Winterprinz mare."
Equestrian,3benko,Netflix4lfe,3,Tue Jun 30 12:34:39 2015 UTC,"I'm excited for you, internet stranger! Sounds like you have a very good choice to make, and have all of the considerations well in hand.  You don't need my 2 cents, but here it is: the bond one forms with a horse can be hard to predict -- sometimes the horses you least expect to fall in love with steal your heart (issues and all) and sometimes the sweet thing that you imagine will nicker at you when you walk into the barn turns out to be less people-oriented or more work than you expected, or undergoes a personality change. So unless it's unquestionable love at first sight or you can't stand the horse's personality/manners, I usually advise people to buy for the tangible things -- movement, soundness, training, connection through the aids -- and let the emotional side of it develop over time.  It sounds like the gelding wins in at least the movement and training departments. The photos you posted were lovely and harmonious and I'm guessing he's a little less through in this video only because it was a few months back and it looks to be a show environment. Things seem to be going right with you and this horse. The fact that trainers that you trust have brought him along would count for a lot if I were in your shoes.  As for the mare, she also looks nice, but also like a fairly ordinary Andalusian as far as movement (glad you had a canter video for that one). My experience with Iberian breeds is that they're often sweet and sensitive, but also sometimes reactive and easily frustrated or overwhelmed. It sounds like you are drawn to her personality but recognize the training work that she would need as well as the uncertainty associated with her young age.  If the finances are a factor be honest with yourself about it -- it's harder to get out from under a multi-owner deal than to re-sell a singly-owned horse if it doesn't work out. Don't forget to look out for yourself as you weigh your ambitions and desires.  But most of all, keep us updated as you make a decision and/or continue your search!"
Equestrian,3benko,ellevt,1 point,Mon Jun 29 00:03:14 2015 UTC,"Good advice! Since your mom is a breeder, do you know anything about her bloodlines? Her sire is Copon, her dam is Kapphara IA. PREs/Andalusians aren't nearly as established in the US so I can't find the same amount of information on her bloodlines as Warmbloods."
Equestrian,3benko,kryrinn,2,Tue Jun 30 12:43:28 2015 UTC,"The first horse sounds pretty much like my horse when I bought him. Super mouthy and pushy and very spoiled thanks to his breeder. I got him when he was 4 but he's now 7 and literally the perfect horse (except trail riding but that's mostly my fault cause I never take him out there and he gets suuuuuper excited.) It's not too hard to get them to stop being so pushy, no treats works really well, ground work and being good at having your elbow so they smack their face into and think it's their idea."
Equestrian,3benko,wntrwhte,2,Mon Jun 29 00:16:34 2015 UTC,That bay is really nice and has tons of presence.   The mare is also quite nice.  If your goal is success in the show ring I would buy the gelding provided he is priced competetively.   Personally I can't imagine the mares disposition is going to give you as much enjoyment as the incredible feeling of riding a horse with as much power as the bay. But I could be wrong.
Equestrian,3benko,IamBre,2,Mon Jun 29 02:34:59 2015 UTC,"I think both horses are beautiful, neither one looks to be an immediate ""wrong"" choice.  But I have a few things to pass on from personal experience.    The bay is beautiful, the horse that I'm more drawn to.  I have a trakehner that looks a lot like him, and sounds like him too.  I've had him for 14 yrs since birth, he wins like crazy because he has floaty uphill movement and he's so smart to train.  But he's explosive, it's not for everyone and I don't think he'll ever outgrow it, but that adds to his skill in dressage.  Many upper level horses need that feeling of power that could be used badly, lol.  He's also extremely fragile, if there's a way he can be injured, he'll find it.  He's high maintenance, he has a very special diet.  If I had access to a Grand Prix barn and cash to maintain him like he needs, it would be a no brainer, he's definitely the horse I'd choose.  If you want to win at every level on the way up, I'd pick this one.   But on the other side, my mom breeds dressage andalusians.  Hers are some of the most loyal, most sensitive, naturally talented horses I've ever riden.  They're comfortable to ride (the trots Are nothing to sit), they're bold and confident, and they're regal.  But many of them are also sensitive minded, like if they get upset they need a gentle hand to guide them out.  On average, they're super hardy, easy keepers, never seem to get injured, and have a very natural uphill balance.  But in my experience, it's much harder to win in lower level dressage.  I've had a lot of first level dressage comments like ""neck is too compressed"", too much collection, etc.  it's harder to teach them to have long floaty strides and reach down into the bridle.  At about third level, it seems to level out and the judges like what they see.  The video doesn't show her trot, so I don't know how much that applies to her.  In the confo picture, she also seems a little short.  A short horse can win but I think mistakes are frequently judged much harsher than a horse like the bay.    Right now due to life circumstances, I live in the middle of nowhere country.  The show circuit is not nearly as prestigious as where I used to live, and the barns are not accustomed to having a horse like my trakehner.  It's difficult to find barns to keep him, difficult to find diets for him, and the climate change was hard on him.  I think if I had an Andalusian, it would be fine because they're so hardy.  Just some things to think about."
Equestrian,3b7w6w,ellevt,3,Fri Jun 26 18:04:30 2015 UTC,"Definetly. They are built completely different. While there are certain things that aren't great in -any- horse (sickle hocks, for example)... shoulder angles and neck placement are going to be very different. Halter horses would have a VASTLY different confirmation than a performance riding horse as well... just look at champion halter arabs and quarter horses and tell me if they'd make remotely decent riding horses in most cases."

Equestrian,3bccwy,Sarahdragoness,2,Sun Jun 28 17:03:03 2015 UTC,"I'd be curious to know what his semen evaluation would be like. With one testical being stuck up in his body, the sperm from it are highly damaged. It would be interesting to know what his progressive motility would be.   I work with a stallion (who thankfully is a standardbred, so artificial insemination is allowed) and his current stud fee is quite high because of his performances. His concentration is very low, and how motility is about a 75%. One collection does maybe two mares at the correct dosage of 500million sperm per millilitre.   People breed for performance, and because of this we have a lot of reproductive problems in stallions as it is passed down. Having a retained testical is hereditary. But money talks. This might cause a rise in kryporchids tb's in the racing world."
Equestrian,3bccwy,2d20x,3,Sun Jun 28 00:43:36 2015 UTC,"I don't know how common it is in other breeds but cryptorchidism is not extremely uncommon in TBs to begin with. AP Indy, Funny Cide, American Pharoah, Slew o' Gold, Honor Code, Roman Ruler, and the Kentucky Derby starters Far Right and Upstart to name just a few. AP Indy's dam, the Secretariat mare Weekend Surprise, also produced Summer Squall who was a ridgling and a very successful sire.  I would not be surprised if someone did a study and found ridglings were more common in the TB than other breeds to begin with."
Equestrian,3bccwy,missprelude,2,Sun Jun 28 04:13:09 2015 UTC,Thanks for sharing this with me! I'm going to look more into it :)
Equestrian,3bccwy,fennecfox89,3,Sun Jun 28 05:30:16 2015 UTC,"AP Indy was a ridgling and he was probably the most successful sire of all time. Definitely top 5. I was poking around to see if there has been an increase in cryptochordism since he came on the scene, but I'm not sure if anyone has been keeping track. Keeneland does indicate whether the yearlings and 2yos going through their sales are colts or ridglings, but if the testicle is still within the inguinal canal they will be qualified as colts. There's a chance the testicle will never fully descend though."
Equestrian,3bccwy,Ephemeral_Halcyon,1 point,Sun Jun 28 01:12:47 2015 UTC,"Yeah it would be interesting. I wish there was more research done to keep track to see if it truly does get passed down. I've heard of a few situations where it does, but honesty, I might of been told a bias thought."

When you are galloping defensively, you shove your foot into the stirrup ""home"".  It is obvious from the way he is ducking a bit over his shoulder that he was in a tight spot and had to chip.

Equestrian,3b4q2t,MistressofTea,1 point,Fri Jun 26 06:08:49 2015 UTC,I think it's a balancing act between security-- keeping the foot home in the stirrup helps you get to a better position and get over that table safely-- and accident prevention -- keeping the foot home increases the risk you will get a foot hooked if you do fall. I have quikout stirrup bars so the entire stirrup leather will come out if I get dragged

Equestrian,3b0p8d,degrista,8,Fri Jun 26 03:13:32 2015 UTC,"Alrighty, my horse has this little hole in his back that you see in the picture. This came out of that hole. He had a little lump on his back for about two years that I assumed was a wart or something benign because it didn't appear to be tender, growing, or otherwise bothersome. Last night I was removing some dead skin from the area and this little thing just popped out. There was a teeny bit of blood just outside the hole that you can see near my finger but otherwise no fluids. The ball is slightly smaller than a pea and is solid but when i press my nail on it, it gets an imprint. It doesn't appear to have any legs or face and nothing looks like it ever had anything attached. I intend to get the vet out but since he has had it for two years I didn't think it was an emergency so I just cleaned it and let it be for now. Has anyone ever seen anything quite like this?"
Equestrian,3b0p8d,MyHorseIsAmazinger,4,Thu Jun 25 01:07:50 2015 UTC,"Yes! No pics to show but my horse had something similar on his neck. Same thing, had it for at least a year and a half, I thought it was a wart- no swelling, heat, discomfort. Had a bit of dry skin covering it. I don't remember why but I started picking it one day because it looked different. The top ""warty"" bit popped off in a hard ball. I squeezed his neck and it was like popping a gigantic blackhead. After awhile it was empty and he had a hole in his neck that looked just like your guys. I just cleaned it out and it healed up really quick.   I should have filmed it for r/popping but that wasn't t the forefront of my mind at the time.  He had never had anything like that before and didn't after. It was just a strange one time thing."

Equestrian,3b0p8d,jasmin356,13,Thu Jun 25 02:58:49 2015 UTC,"::shudders:: A vet should definitely come look at it, and I'd be super curious to see what they said.  Just guessing though, it looks like some kind of cyst, possibly from an injury/rub from a poor fitting saddle, that has just been chilling and getting grosser (in non-medical terms) for a couple of years.  It's so close to his spine though!"
Equestrian,3b0p8d,TheBostonLady,6,Thu Jun 25 01:39:41 2015 UTC,"That is what is curious. It never got infected and it never bothered him. Never warm or tender or anything. It is like he is part clam and something got in his skin, he made it a ""pearl"" coating, and then it just needed to roll out! No infection and inside the hole it just looks like skin, nothing raw or oozey. So weird! I just cut the ball open and it just kind of flaked apart a bit and looks like dead skin. I am so curious as to what the vet has to say!"
Equestrian,3b0p8d,ellevt,5,Thu Jun 25 01:57:35 2015 UTC,"Hahaha, man, I had a visceral reaction to that pic of the hole in his back!  I really hope you post an update just so I know what it is for my peace of mind!  But yeah, that sounds like an old cyst - I'm guessing that if at one point he got ridden while he wasn't super clean, (like in the winter when they're all fur and mud,) then some dirt could have gotten pushed down into a pore - that's all it takes for a cyst to form.  An old cyst though would turn more into what you're seeing, like a fistula, but closed.  At this point, the infection has gone away, and then skin has 'healed' around the irritant, which would explain why there's no more blood or pus."
Equestrian,3azudj,p53angel,16,Wed Jun 24 20:54:19 2015 UTC,"First of all- she needs to put on 150lbs stat.  Her topline needs a ton of work. The best course of action is do to lots of engaged long and low work to get her lifting her back. Get your saddle fit checked as well- she has significant muscle wasting in her back (could be a side effect of being underweight though).   She's a bit postlegged in the back (QHs often are), and a bit more upright in the shoulder than what I prefer. A little too much slope in her hindquarters, but I think she'll fill out well once she gets some weight on.   Her loin is pretty weak right now (which is where the lifting her back work comes into play) and I don't love the placement of her SI joint.  She's not perfect but not a trainwreck conformationally and she should serve you pretty well for lower level eventing. I'd love to see another picture of her in a few months with some more weight and muscle tone."
Equestrian,3azudj,altf4life,2,Wed Jun 24 21:17:09 2015 UTC,"Yeah - the weight has been a hard battle. I've put her on triple crown complete (from safechoice original) with smartgut smartpak bc the vet thinks she's having ulcers. She's started to gain just on the higher calorie food, just started the supplement, so waiting to see improvement there. I tried cocosoya, but she HATED it.   I was using a poorly fitted saddle for a month or two until I realized :( I've been using a better fitting one since March. My mom sold my side reins, so I'd like to get her lunging in side reins. Thoughts on that?    Thanks! I can see all your points! She seems long in the back to me."
Equestrian,3azudj,thisiswhyifail,9,Wed Jun 24 21:33:10 2015 UTC,"I would recommend not using side reins as they just tuck the head down and won't give you the true engagement you need to build up her topline.  Like another poster said, lots of engaged long and low work is going to be best for building up her top line. I'm not sure what her fitness level is like, but if you have a field with hills to ride in that would be great. Start with short trot sets. She may not be able to carry herself fully engaged the entire time, that's fine and don't push it. A good goal is to eventually be doing 20 minute trot sets (10 each way) with a good level of hind end engagement/long and low"
Equestrian,3azudj,altf4life,4,Wed Jun 24 22:59:06 2015 UTC,Hifat Extruded pellets or rice bran & canola oil should help with weight gain (oil especially!!)
Equestrian,3azudj,J973,4,Wed Jun 24 21:57:47 2015 UTC,"How much is she being ridden per day?  How aerobically?  It's a simple calorie in, calorie out.  I see a lot of people ""riding the fur"" off their horses and they can't get any weight on them.  The horse gets hurt or the person goes on vacation for a few weeks and magically the horse gains weight."
Equestrian,3azudj,prefinished,3,Wed Jun 24 23:11:18 2015 UTC,"Thirding the oil.  I think I've always had it mixed with some senior feed (which is mixed in their daily feed, so not a sole senior diet) too for weight gain whether it be ulcers, age, or just one of those horses."
Equestrian,3azudj,Ephemeral_Halcyon,2,Thu Jun 25 15:35:00 2015 UTC,"Try purina senior feed instead. It's extremely easily digested and meant for older horses that have trouble keeping weight on.   I'm also seconding vegetable oil. And if you don't feed her alfalfa, add some. It does a lot to offset the problems the ulcers cause. Along with 24/7 free choice coastal or grass and fresh water.  And if she has ulcer problems, run her through a course of ranitidine.   My TB mare dropped about 500 lbs over ulcers."
Equestrian,3azudj,blizzard07,1 point,Thu Jun 25 05:45:25 2015 UTC,"I had a long go with my mare and ulcers too. She got so thin no matter what I fed her until I finally realized what was going on (I wasn't using my usual vet at the time and she insisted my horse couldn't possibly have ulcers) and treated her with the omeprazole (Gastro Guard or Ulcer Guard but they have different dosing instructions so pay attention). She put so much weight back on, became much less grumpy and just all around more pleasant to be around. The treatment is expensive but if the horse is scoped and positive for ulcers it's worth it."
Equestrian,3azudj,Ephemeral_Halcyon,2,Wed Jun 24 23:26:39 2015 UTC,"The vet ran my TB mare through two courses of ranitidine. May be a much more cost-effective option. You can just buy a large bottle from Wal Mart and crush them up, give them via syringe in applesauce. You might bring it up with your vet, doseage will vary."
Equestrian,3azudj,blizzard07,2,Thu Jun 25 05:47:08 2015 UTC,I did the full tubes of Ulcer Guard for 28 days. If you give the whole tube it's the same dose as gastroguard but MUCH cheaper. I think I ended up saving like $300 doing it that way. I've heard of some people having luck with ranitidine but that one I'm not familiar with!
Equestrian,3azudj,blizzard07,1 point,Thu Jun 25 16:58:00 2015 UTC,I'm down to either ulcers or something reproductive. I'm really hoping the smartgut helps. I don't have a couple grand to get her scoped for ulcers :/
Equestrian,3azudj,fennecfox89,2,Thu Jun 25 01:55:48 2015 UTC,"Depends on if your local vet has a scope. Mine does, and it wouldn't be more than a few hundred to have it done. An alternative I've heard is to get Maalox (anti-acid) and give 60 ccs orally twice a day. If improvement is noticed it's likely a stomach issue. I did that for a short time under vet recommendation (I didn't have the scope money at the time) and it made my horse much more comfortable."
Equestrian,3azudj,raychul78,1 point,Thu Jun 25 17:00:48 2015 UTC,"You don't have to scope for ulcers, but you have to treat them. SmartGut is a preventative for ""all things belly"" but won't treat ulcers. You need to use UlcerGard to treat it. They bill GastroGard as treatment and UlcerGard as preventative, but they're the exact same thing (UlcerGard is just a little cheaper and doesn't need an Rx from the vet.) You can get it for $27/tube from EntirelyPets. The standard treatment is one full tube per day for 30 days, then wean them off, but people have had success treating with 1/2 tube for 30 days instead.   Alfalfa is also really good for horses with ulcer problems. It's very high in calcium and acts as a buffer for an acidic stomach."
Equestrian,3azudj,Inloveforever,1 point,Thu Jun 25 10:24:34 2015 UTC,"If you need to gain weight fast, feed her beet pulp... Make sure to soak it in water before you feed it to her... Best of luck!"
Equestrian,3azudj,Al-Capony,8,Thu Jun 25 05:19:21 2015 UTC,"She definitely needs some weight asap, especially if you want to start training for eventing.  She looks to have an ewe neck, it could be because she needs some weight. Shark fin withers(she got that from her TB side)and a serious lack of topline. Gaining weight will help with both.  A bit narrow in the shoulder and tied at the knee.  I can't see her feet so I can't comment there, however something is bothering me with the right rear, old injury maybe?   She has a steep croup..   I don't see the post legged in the back.. I believe overall she is just lacking weight and muscle.  She has a kind expression! Decent bone, She is not over at the knee both of which are very common in TB.  Overall she is a honest looking girl, just get some weight on her and work that hind end!!"
Equestrian,3azudj,CMPRacer,1 point,Wed Jun 24 21:34:39 2015 UTC,"Good eye! There's a current wound on her fetlock. Unexplained pasture nick. Although I completely panicked, it's healing nicely and she's stayed sound on it.   I'm trying very hard to put weight on! Hoping I don't have to do a round of ulcerguard or succeed, but if she's still looking underweight on smartgut, I'll probably have to."
Equestrian,3azudj,daydreams356,3,Wed Jun 24 21:41:17 2015 UTC,"I agree with what the others are saying, but a few other things I also noticed:  You may have a bit of problems getting that hind end engaged because her hip angle isn't the same as her shoulder. Her shoulder is pretty steep (but really a pretty nice angle), while the hip is a bit flatter. This will mean it will be harder for her to get under herself...with some work, it probably won't be noticeable, though, especially if you aren't trying to do crazy advanced level stuff.  The other thing I noticed is how short her pasterns are. Personally I'd prefer a little on the shorter side than long pasterns (especially for jumping) because long tends to mean weak, bu the thing is, she may have a higher likelihood of developing ringbone. It helps that she's not also upright in her pasterns, I wouldn't worry about it and use that potential as reason to limit what she does, but it is something to keep in mind, especially if she were to come up with a ""mystery lameness"" when she's older. They aren't always easy to catch, as they aren't going to be your first guess when it comes to lameness, especially if she's jumping!"
Equestrian,3azudj,Barren23,2,Thu Jun 25 01:05:35 2015 UTC,Maybe develop some neck muscles
Equestrian,3azudj,ellevt,2,Thu Jun 25 11:50:53 2015 UTC,"Hey! Just some quick things I saw. First off, the weight thing isn't that big of a deal. She isn't that badly underweight. I don't like seeing ribs too much degree, but its common in any thoroughbred crosses. People tend to like their horses vastly overweight. A very fit horse WILL show some ribs. Just make sure she is dewormed, has a good diet, and getting something like oil in her feed. She isn't going to drop dead. My eventing thoroughbred when I was younger had 3xs the amount of feed of the quarter horses in my barn and was still on the thinner side for most of when we had him... though very fit... even at his thickest Most athletic horse I've ever ridden, still to this day. Speaking of him and underdeveloped... here was him 2 years prior when we got him. Keep in mind, I was a kid so my proper topline training wasn't the best but muscle development in general did great things for him (starting at 10 yrs old too!) and he made it to preliminary eventing before I went to college and stupidly sold him. Despire his long and lower neck, he was a decent mover and a great and scopey jumper.  For your horse, her neck is obviously very undeveloped. It isn't an ewe neck at all, but if you ride her with her head up she will develop really strong muscling through the bottom of her neck... which would be bad. I can tell she has the tendancy to hollow her back and raise her head. This is common and not a horrible thing in a young horse and thoroughbred cross... it happens. That being said, I'd work her on a lot of long and low type exercises to teach her to relax through the body, stretch, and work her topline. You don't need to do it the whole ride, but teach her to reach for the bit little by little in a warmup. I've had great success with this and usually work my horses for 10 minutes in a long and low frame through warmup. That being said, you need to make sure she is active and connected. As you see from my old horse I posted above, you don't need a highly developed neck to be exceptional at eventing. Most of the higher level thoroughbreds have pretty straggly necks. Its important though to make sure she doesn't develop incorrect muscling as that will hinder her and make sure not to use gadgets to get what you want.  Her poll is right where it should be (a line at a 90 degree angle from her shoulder line points right to her poll) though her neck is held very low. Her shoulder isn't exceptional, but its pretty good and when she is working through the back I think she'd have a lovely gait. Her shoulder angle is less than 90 degrees which is great. Her legs are set nicely and look strong. The pastern angle is where is should be and they arent too long or short for my tastes.   Her hips are where there might be some issues. Her hip length is really low to her body length and while I can't pin it here on my phone, there is something funky going on with her lion area. That being said, I think she will do well as long as you develop everything correctly. When she gets muscle on and maybe a little weight, She will look very nice. Her front legs good great, in my opinion, and that will serve you well in eventing. I think she will take you where you want to be. Try to develop that back end a bit and see where it goes."

Equestrian,3b0fvp,sweetcatofmine,3,Thu Jun 25 00:01:33 2015 UTC,"Thanks. Hopefully we won't get more bad news on Monday whenever they do the MRI.  Apparently he was a perfect patient, just about. He came willingly to the gate of his paddock to be haltered when they wanted to work with him and he did his best to be a gentleman. He even let the vet give him a bath, which he normally hates.  I'm pretty proud of him for being a good boy, even in a new place and in pain."
Equestrian,3b0fvp,diamonte,2,Thu Jun 25 00:29:34 2015 UTC,I am so sorry and will be hoping for the best for you and your horse! He sounds like a sweetheart and he's lucky to have someone as caring and invested in his health as you!
Equestrian,3b0fvp,Sawfeather,1 point,Thu Jun 25 04:43:31 2015 UTC,Aww he is so cute. I hate to hear this. My thoughts are with you and just keep positive as much as you can. I know it's hard. I've been through something similar. Best wishes.
Equestrian,3b23v3,BertMoonchild,2,Thu Jun 25 10:17:40 2015 UTC,"I have one.   At my barn there was a stallion named Tee. He was owned by our barn owner for a very long time and he was on his way out (around 26 years old).  It was winter and there was no hope. His spirit was gone. He seemed ready. There may have been a little selfishness fighting him through winter - but its always hard to say goodbye. His feet did get bad, but a vet was able to fix them later... he was just too frail....  Spring came and was staying steady in the 60s. Our barn owner decided he didn't want Tee to die in a stall, or that be his last look. Thinking, that he would be calling the vet soon, he slowly walked this once magnificent stallion out to the pasture. Tee was wobbly and weak, but excited to munch on spring grass. To our amazement, Day 7 he was trotting and galloping up and down the fence rows when we put the geldings out in the back pasture. It was just a complete change. By fall though, it was time to go. He was losing weight fast and just not the same. BO decided he didn't want to put Tee through another harsh Ohio winter. He had a nice big meal of sugary feed and we got him to lay down and the vet took care of the rest.  It was amazing to see him perk up, even if it was such little time to be had. He had 2 cows that were his buddies in the pasture with him and he loved messing with the Geldings and flirting with the mares through the fence. No one expected him to survive that first winter. It was rough on him physically and in spirit.   Everyone was happy to see Tee leave life in a dignified manner, having enjoyed the summer sun one last time. He left on a beautiful day - but it started to rain about an hour after his passing.  We let the geldings out in his pasture and they all went over and hanged out near where he was buried. They seemed to know as well. You could tell his 2 cows missed him too."

Equestrian,3b23v3,LizVet,1 point,Thu Jun 25 19:41:54 2015 UTC,I had a suspected tetanus case - we don't see it very often as most horses are vaccinated. It is also very difficult for them to pull throu gh.  I think we just caught it very early and managed to pump enough anti toxin into him to get him throu gh.  I was so convinced that he would die overnight that I snuck down to that he yard before the owners to check he was still standing. Vaccinate your ponies peeps!

Equestrian,3az2pz,PinkPonySwag,15,Wed Jun 24 17:30:30 2015 UTC,"I'm a working student currently and let me tell you, I started with debts. And I still have them. I haven't paid on any of my debts in over 3 years and everything I ""own"" is owned in someone elses name so that I won't have them seized by tax collection companies. I work hard all the time. I work 80 hour plus work weeks just to afford to live and keep my horses and show. I chose to do that over financial freedom and living ""a good quality life"". I live at the grace of other people, and it is not fun.  The problem with being a professional in this world is that you can have talent, and you can have a horse with talent, but more often than not I see people selling their talents and their horses, remaining virtually nameless, all because they can't afford it. My trainer has a very talented horse for example, capable of winning divisions in the jumper ring at about 1.30m and capable of winning intermediate level events. She was only able to show him one time this season because she had literally no money, and that is how most of this world is.   My advice is honestly get a job with your degree, start paying your student loans, and maybe work part time for a barn on weekends. It's better to be a highly paid amateur than a struggling professional in 9.9 cases/10"
Equestrian,3az2pz,mrflossin,12,Wed Jun 24 19:29:51 2015 UTC,"This right here is the only reason I don't quit my job tomorrow to get into horses. I daydream about it a lot because my day job is mentally taxing, very demanding, and frankly quite boring.   But most of the professionals that I know (who don't come from ""family money"" and most aren't like, international-GP-level competitors) all say it really stops being fun because your horse is the last horse that gets ridden, and often your goals/desires are put on the back burner in order to help your clients. They're always just scraping by to make a living, pay through the roof for health insurance, often have to be given clothes/equipment by their stable or sponsors. Something that stuck with me is a trainer who has a great, wealthy client base and is successful all over the country. He bought a horse for his daughter and said, ""I'm just glad we can finally afford to keep a nice one and not have to sell it."" So in his fifties after a life of working hard, he is just now getting to the fun part, and it's still mostly for his kids- he rides some nice client horses, but we all know that's not the same as saying ""this is mine, I made this happen for me.""  While I love showing kids how to tack up their ponies, and clean bridles and stuff... I like making enough money to have the OPTION to show if I want to, stay at the barn late because I want to, NOT stand in the blazing sun on my feet for 18 hours a day just to make ends meet. I respect working students and professionals that train them, but currently that life is not for me. Maybe when my debts are paid off and I have a chunk of money put away that may change. But from every single person I've talked to, IT IS HARD.  I would advise getting a job of some sort (can be with horses if you choose) that pays, get yourself sorted and do the working student/grunt gig when you can. Lots of people need extra help, and you can also make cash teaching up-down lessons or mucking stalls/grooming for the pro. After trying it on for size, you'll be much better informed as to what you are signing up for."
Equestrian,3az2pz,carbonarbonoxide,3,Wed Jun 24 19:54:31 2015 UTC,"For a better idea of how I live, I am set to make only $1,500 above expenses this year (not counting my debt which I really should be trying to pay off), and of course we know shit happens so really make that number realistically 0. I am set to break even in the case that things don't go really really badly. My debt is $3000, not very much, but I can't pay a penny towards it, there is literally no room in my budget. The only thing, short of selling my show horse (which I will not do no matter what), that I could cut to make room for it is my complete show budget for the year. Eventing is nice because that $3000 covers all the shows I go to, nice and cost friendly. If I cut my show budget then what on earth is the point of what I am doing? And so the eternal hole.  Edit: to clarify, I will live in a tent and eat ketchup packets as food before I give up my show career. I don't want to grow old with shoulda coulda and wouldas"

Equestrian,3az2pz,RonRonner,4,Tue Jul 7 16:39:58 2015 UTC,"I've been a working student with my parents' generous financial support and I was also a working student with a small lesson and training base that helped offset many of my costs.    There are lots of different ways to configure being a working student.  If I were pursuing the experience just to learn more and improve my riding and horsemanship, I would probably live at home and take advantage of the mentorship relationship by working off the cost of lessons through barn work. You'll also likely get the opportunity to ride some schoolmasters and client horses.  If I were pursuing it as a way to get my feet wet as a young professional, I would be more inclined to find a situation where I could live on the property and receive a small stipend for food.  Ask if there might be an opportunity to earn some pocket money through lessons or training rides.  It's through this path that most young pros without serious family money find a patron (usually someone with a nice horse but not enough time or skills to campaign it) who will help move along your career. Big name trainers and local big name trainers don't stay big forever and as they get older, they often find it very rewarding to hand over the reins to someone they've helped bring along."
Equestrian,3az2pz,diamonte,2,Wed Jun 24 18:28:07 2015 UTC,"I hadn't even thought of a work-off-lessons situation, but it makes a lot of sense.  I'm going to look into that.  I'm currently negotiating a paid position that I can actually survive and pay loans on, so I'm hoping to swing it for 6 months or so."
Equestrian,3az2pz,diamonte,5,Tue Jul 7 16:41:15 2015 UTC,"I have been a working student for about one year in total, during the summers between college and then for the past winter in Wellington. I can totally understand the difficulty of financial worries. I was very lucky to graduate with minimal student loans, and I had some savings, so I paid for my expenses. But money was very, very stressful, and one of the biggest reasons that I decided against going pro. I realized that even if I acquired the skills for it, I wouldn't have the money to buy my own quality horse to start getting my name out there.   So I decided instead to get a real person job, which I will be starting in two weeks. I have to say, it's a relief and knowing that I will have spare cash instead getting paid $100/week (or whatever it might be).   What are your goals for being a working student? Do you want to go pro?  The last trainer I worked for was in her sixties, is still riding horses every day, and has broken her back and her neck (and that's just the injuries I know of, within the last 15 years or so). She is TOUGH. But also, that sort of a lifestyle scares me. And if you're not lucky enough to heal from an injury like that, do you have a good backup plan for what to do?  I kind of agree with other posters, it's a hard life and if you don't have financial support, you might be better off finding a career where you can be a wealthy amateur. ;)  I don't regret my experiences at all, and as far as advice goes: Don't take anything your trainer says too personally. Develop a thick skin and appreciate the honesty. (As long as they aren't being overly abusive, of course. Some trainers, from what I've heard, do toe that line).  Don't get caught up in the short term, day to day stuff. It can be frustrating if you don't ride for a couple days when that's your only source of compensation, but try and think about the long term progress you're making. I've gotten that reality check before from a trainer, because it can be easy to lose perspective.  I'm always happy to answer more questions about my experiences, and if you ever want to PM me and talk about possible trainers to work for, I might be able to give some perspective."
Equestrian,3az2pz,diamonte,3,Wed Jun 24 20:37:05 2015 UTC,"A little more advice: Be detail-oriented. Never rise on the wrong diagonal. Always have your bridle straight with everything tucked into the keepers. Good trainers will notice these things.   On the other side, be quick and efficient. Sweep an aisle quickly. At most barns getting them perfectly clean on a daily basis isn't necessary, but recognize how you can step it up for a clinic or some other occasion.   Be enthusiastic, every single day.  Learn to anticipate your trainer's needs so you can get tasks done ahead of time.   And, in my personal opinion, I wouldn't always go for the trainer with the biggest ""name"". They probably won't have enough time to help you and will always be busy doing clinics or showing or whatever. There are so many less famous talented and educated trainers, and if they're less busy, they'll have more time to help you and mentor you."

Equestrian,3az2pz,Summer_Frost,3,Wed Jul 8 16:06:24 2015 UTC,"I've been a working student at a few barns. My advice is to treat it like a job. I would either email the barn manager or owner or meet them in person. Have an informal resume going over your riding experience, showing experience, and listing what you can bring to the barn (I typically offer technology help - updating websites, social media, handling mass emails to members of the barn - barn work, exercising horses, help during shows, etc. Whatever you think could help a barn, even a little). Bring it with you for a meeting or attach it to an email asking if they offer working student positions.   If a barn already has a working student program then I would recommend adding some of the above information about you to an email or conversation about joining. Barns near me vary from 3 hours of work for a half hour private to 4 hours for an hour group to working three days at a minimum of 2 hours for an hour group lesson. They all have their own ideas of how much the time is worth.   But the biggest thing is to not be afraid to ask at barns without an advertised program. A barn where I worked didn't advertise it but they were the best barn. After showing I put effort into my work they didn't care how much time I rode in and out of lessons as long as I checked ahead of time to make sure the horse I wanted was free."

Equestrian,3avo9c,cannes23,7,Tue Jun 23 23:34:08 2015 UTC,Lunge lines are awesome. I wish more instructors used it for advanced level riders. Actually many of the grand prix dressage riders use lunge lines to help them improve their riding.  I had a lot of trouble figuring out how to engage my core during canter and sitting trot a couple years ago and after an hour lunge lesson I finally found what I needed. Absolutely essential to any good training program!

Equestrian,3avo9c,AuntieChiChi,18,Wed Jun 24 21:34:07 2015 UTC,One tip! Get his nose in front of the vertical. He is avoiding contact by going under like that. :) Lower levels should actually have their noses in front of the vertical but accepting contact. Here is an article about its effects.   Gorgeous horse and good luck! Dressage exercises are great for all disciplines.
Equestrian,3avo9c,daydreams356,2,Wed Jun 24 00:38:41 2015 UTC,Nice read
Equestrian,3avo9c,deliciouslysaucy,5,Wed Jun 24 18:44:18 2015 UTC,"Awesome to see a working horse and rider embracing dressage! I hope you had fun at the clinic. Don't worry about feeling like a noob -- most dressage trainers worth their salt put just about everyone on the longe line to help in developing feel and refine the seat.   And don't worry too much about your horse going behind the vertical for now -- where his head is is of zero importance until you have your horse forward, relaxed, and more longitudinally balanced (which sounds easy enough but takes months to years for most amateur riders). Before they develop some self-carriage, some horses will poke their noses out, other will curl them in. As long as you're not cranking him into a false headset it will fix itself as you progress with dressage."
Equestrian,3avo9c,daydreams356,2,Wed Jun 24 01:47:45 2015 UTC,"Yes, i remember the instructor talking about that. I don't remember what was on my mind the moment this pic was taken, but we did get some things fixed in the seat and leg by the end of the clinic"
Equestrian,3avo9c,deliciouslysaucy,2,Wed Jun 24 18:49:08 2015 UTC,"Usually when you see them behind they are being pulled in. From my experience at least. Shouldn't worry about where the head is at all really but know it's okay,and preferable to be in front of the vertical"
Equestrian,3avo9c,deliciouslysaucy,1 point,Wed Jun 24 07:06:54 2015 UTC,"I disagree with your generalization. Many, many, many horses go BTV when they're not comfortable in the contact and they're not in front of the leg, no matter how light the rider is in the hand. In situations like OP's (no draw reins, martingales, other dumb gadgets, no leverage bits, no break in the bit-hand-elbow line, no chicken wing elbows or elbows way back behind body, presumably no face wagging) BTV is almost always a function of the horse needing to go more forward and figure out its longitudinal balance.  If in response to your hot tip the OP gives away any more contact before the horse really gets the hind end engaged, that poor horse is going to have no support and will plow onto the forehand while possibly still tucking his nose BTV. You can't fix this situation without forward. OP has some room for improvement in the connection to the bit (learning to keep the elbows bent and getting nice elasticity through the arm to the shoulder blades takes a while), but it doesn't look like he's cranking on the face for the purpose of putting the horse in an outline -- his hands are actually in a pretty nice spot for a first dressage experience.   tl;dr OP is doing quite well and falls within the majority of dressage beginners who need more forward, not the minority who get BTV from aggressive or leveraged rein pressure."
Equestrian,3avo9c,daydreams356,1 point,Thu Jun 25 00:37:51 2015 UTC,"I have trouble being supple in the shoulders and getting that elasticity. I've made SOME progress with it. Very hard going from swat (if it jams, force it, if it breaks, it needs to be replaced) to mounted (less is more as pertains to pressure). This is one interesting challenge I enjoy!"
Equestrian,3avo9c,deliciouslysaucy,1 point,Thu Jun 25 02:41:10 2015 UTC,"Wow, yeah that would be a tough transition! That sort of elasticity takes time for even milquetoast dressage snobs to develop, so your awareness that it's something to work on puts you ahead of the game. I hope you continue to enjoy the challenge!"
Equestrian,3avo9c,daydreams356,0,Thu Jun 25 11:43:25 2015 UTC,"You do realize that's EXACTLY what I'm saying. And in the article I posted right? ""Getting him in front of the vertical"" essentially means more action from behind."
Equestrian,3avo9c,CaliGirl16,1 point,Thu Jun 25 01:03:12 2015 UTC,"Your previous comment proposed that ""being pulled in"" (by the hand) was the cause for most horses going BTV. I disagreed with that explicit statement and with your ""tip"" that OP should worry about the horse being BTV. You said nothing about forwardness and that message is buried so deep in the preachy prose of sustainable dressage that it bears repeating. If by 'getting him in front of the vertical' you meant 'more action from behind' you chose a very round about way to say it and one that probably has very little practical value to most dressage beginners. I have zero interest with arguing with someone like you -- my comments are purely meant to congratulate the OP on the good job he is doing for his first dressage adventure and to encourage people to look and think critically when they see a horse moving like this instead of jumping on the ""OMG Rollkur must have heavy hands"" bandwagon."

The average large truck hauling one horse, should get a minimum of 10 MPG if you're not hauling it over the mountains. Assuming gas is $3.50/gal, you're looking at roughly $26.25 in fuel. If you're paying her federal minimum wage, you're looking at another $21.75, so $50 + $48...I'd call it a cool $100."

Equestrian,3aruxq,diamonte,11,Tue Jun 23 00:26:01 2015 UTC,"This is Lingho, a 5 year old Hanoverian gelding. I'm so lucky to have the chance to ride him! I got to show him in Florida at training level, and we're going to show first level this July. We had a clinic this weekend and worked a lot on straightness. He is the most powerful horse I've ever sat on and gives such a good feeling that it can be easy to forget about the basics, and the importance of controlling every footfall.  I'm very excited that my trainer is letting me ride him so much. He's a very delicate horse who has the tendency to curl. Encouraging him to reach out into the contact is difficult, but he is such a rewarding horse to ride!"
Equestrian,3aruxq,carbonarbonoxide,0,Tue Jun 23 00:32:18 2015 UTC,"He's just a baby, most warmbloods aren't even what I'd call ""broke"" (not having episodes of ""baby brain"") until they're 8 or 9. He looks great, and I bet the consistency with accepting and seeking contact will come with time. Looking good though!"

Equestrian,3aruxq,wikaylachi,2,Mon Jun 29 16:57:58 2015 UTC,"Yes, it is. He has some issues with his mouth/jaw, and therefore does not seek out the contact very willingly. Using a Micklem seems to help him, but moreso than the equipment, it's about always encouraging him to reach into the contact."
Equestrian,3aruxq,CrimNI103,1 point,Tue Jun 30 12:37:55 2015 UTC,Gotcha. I was curious whether it was being used to steady the bit and/or relieve pressure somewhere. I've got a horse that tends to be a little unsteady in contact/backed off and have been curious about Mickelems for just that purpose. Your guy looks lovely!!
Equestrian,3at21q,randomthoughtsofemma,14,Tue Jun 23 07:41:36 2015 UTC,Seriously.  Whack her rump with your lead rope. If she was doing this to another horse she'd almost certainly be kicked. You hitting her with the end of your lead rope is basically the same thing and something she will understand. Don't think about getting kicked because chances are she'll be too startled and just move her hind end away from you instead of thinking about kicking. Also try to start teaching her how to yield her hind end so that you can move them away easily and it'll help when you start her.
Equestrian,3at21q,dunmorestriden,1 point,Tue Jun 23 15:48:58 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the advice and next time she tries to get me to scratch her rump while I'm leading her, I will definitely give her a quick smack with the lead rope and hope for the best. I hadn't actually thought about teaching her to yield her hindquarters, but that is now near the top of my to do list - i think it will definitely help a lot."
Equestrian,3at21q,tabbicat,2,Wed Jun 24 08:54:26 2015 UTC,"Before you smack her, make sure to say something or make a cluck sound, something to associate ""move your butt"" with.  My horse would yield his hind end to ""move that butt"" you say that and he'd swing his butt away from you every single time, and it only took a month or so to establish the cue (via popping him with the lead rope when he /didn't/ move.)  You don't necessarily want them spinning their butt away from you just cause you're back there, eventually you'll have to brush their tail, or take a temperature, and that's tough if they think their butt shouldn't be anywhere near you. You want their butt near you on your terms, not theirs, though.  If you can establish a verbal cue it'll make your life much easier. Just remember to put it to practice a few times a week, so they don't forget what that means."
Equestrian,3at21q,RonRonner,9,Wed Jun 24 20:27:41 2015 UTC,"I agree totally with /u/dunmorestriden.    Also, I may be off base but I get the impression by the description you gave about her background, how she was shipped to you, the reference to your bond, and how sweet she is that you may be straying into the territory of treating her like a poor, rescued baby instead of beginning her education as a horse.  Of course we all love our horses and there's no question that we develop a bond but if she's being rude (and she is, even if she doesn't mean to), it's your job as an adult human who handles her to start teaching her proper behavior and establishing boundaries.  The tricky thing about foals is that you have to teach them everything, they won't accidentally happen upon what you expect of them.  Don't scratch her rump anymore because she's going to get mixed signals.  You fell into the very common trap of indulging a cute behavior in a little horse that becomes less cute (or dangerous) when they become big.  Now you're going to have to either negatively reinforce the behavior by ignoring her when she solicits the scratching or by disciplining her when she does it.  It's a little unfair because from her perspective, nothing has changed but now the response to this thing she's always done is bad.    Instead, substitute a desired behavior.  Work on her haltering and leading skills.  If it starts going awry, you need an experienced trainer who is familiar with working with foals.  They're not like adult horses, or even problem horses.  When she starts soliciting rubs and scratches, put her to work.  Ask her to walk off briskly, halt, change direction. Redirect her focus.  And DO NOT PLAY WITH HER AT LIBERTY.  She's too big for that now and you're only going to mix her up more.  Clear boundaries--when she's being handled by a human, she has to behave a certain way.  When she's on her time, she can do whatever she wants.  That's because she's a horse and you're a person and at this stage of the game, making that line explicitly clear is absolutely paramount."
Equestrian,3at21q,dunmorestriden,6,Tue Jun 23 16:06:27 2015 UTC,"Just adding to this, don't treat her like a pet. At all. I had to stop giving my horse treats and anything like that because of how rude he's gotten. You gotta treat them like a horse, use a language they understand. You have to ask them to do something and if they don't do it you have to tell them. Watch how horses act around food and each other, just watch their body language. It sounds stupid but it helps."
Equestrian,3at21q,dunmorestriden,1 point,Tue Jun 23 17:57:43 2015 UTC,Thank you - i will take your advice in not treating her like any other type of pet. i think i will also stop giving her treats and instead will change from using only treats as a reward system if she's good to patting her when shes been good. i really hope it works.
Equestrian,3at21q,RonRonner,1 point,Wed Jun 24 08:45:27 2015 UTC,It should! Good luck :)
Equestrian,3argbm,Majalou,1 point,Mon Jun 22 22:24:32 2015 UTC,"Scratch them under the mane and in the groves that run under the neck. They also like to be scratched around the withers. It's a horse friendship ritual and it usually works well. While your scratching watch for their eyelids to droop or nose to start twitching, that is their itchy spot. It usually doesn't change (there may also be several), scratch there every time you groom them and they should start to really like you."
Equestrian,3argbm,ze1da,1 point,Tue Jun 23 00:56:24 2015 UTC,"Haha, can confirm! https://youtu.be/A0UMoykt99U"
Equestrian,3argbm,theawesomestest,1 point,Tue Jun 23 01:17:27 2015 UTC,"Some advice for you -   Your brain is going to remember 100x more than you think, and your muscles won't remember at all after 10 years. So for the first 3-5 rides, try and limit your physical exertion to 50% of your total muscle strength. I say this because the muscles that are  key for generating balance, leg aids and movement in the saddle are not really used a lot in everyday life. You are going to be running on excitement and adrenaline for the first few rides and not paying much attention to your muscles complaining so the chances of you straining or otherwise injuring yourself are higher.   TLDR; take it easy on your body so your muscles can catch up to your memories  Source: I am a certified instructor who took a six-year hiatus in my early twenties and injured myself by coming back to full intensity riding right away."
Equestrian,3argbm,bovata,1 point,Tue Jun 23 01:20:26 2015 UTC,"Welcome back! My advice would be to stretch beforehand because you'll be very sore haha! Building a relationship is like any relationship: trust, respect, kindness. Don't worry so much, you and the horse will learn about each other in time and you'll find their likes and dislikes. Just have fun and be safe!"

I was very on/off with lessons in high school/ college then took a few years off and am finally really getting back into it too!  My best advice is to stretch and stay calm.  I remember being really nervous getting back up on a horse for the first time after a couple year break.  Also, move at your speed, try not to get intimidated by other people that you ride with or feeling like you need to pick up where you left off.  Finally...Have fun!!!"
Equestrian,3argbm,SheMork,1 point,Tue Jun 23 03:00:08 2015 UTC,Thanks for responding guys. It's actually been really helpful.

Equestrian,3argbm,theawesomestest,1 point,Mon Jun 29 21:37:13 2015 UTC,"Congrats on riding again! I just started riding after a 10+ years this year. Sometimes it's been the best thing ever, sometimes it's been frustrating. My body doesn't quite move the way I remember it moving as a 14 year old. Haha  Don't over use treats when trying to build respect, one of the best ways that I have learned is to do a lot of ground work and lounging. I actually don't give me mare treats, when she does something good I say good girl and give her a pat. Treats certainly have their uses, but I wouldn't start off with them.   Remember that horses often reflect our own energy, so try to stay calm. This is something that I struggle with!  If you want to get to know your horse first, definitely start with ground work and lounging :)  Goodluck! You'll love it!  Edit: I should not reddit while at work."
Equestrian,3aqvw3,SGSHBO,3,Mon Jun 22 19:52:01 2015 UTC,"I had a show over the weekend and in short- it was brutal. I hosed myself and my mare down probably once an hour, all day long.   If she's food-driven and well-mannered on the ground, you should have an easy time teaching her a simple trail obstacles. Something my mare and I are working on right now are variations on the ""pond"" obstacle. Get a plastic baby pool and ask her to walk through it. You walk through first, then turn and face her (be careful to watch her body language- don't want her to leap at you!) and ask her to step forward.  Tips: Don't haul off on her face, she wants to be with you, but pulling on her directly may make her ""set back"" a bit. You can weave her front feet a bit to keep her from squaring back against it, but make sure that you stay directly across from her, or she'll just cut the corner and step around it. Once she sticks her nose in it to investigate it, you're nearly there.   Once you've got her walking through it, you can fill it with water, sand, or empty crumpled water bottles, cut up pool noodles, ice, etc. The possibilities are endless. I'm currently trying to get the wonderhorse to walk through it, stop with her back feet inside, and pivot in a circle, keeping her back feet in the pool. It's a brain game, so be sure to start slow and don't do it for more than five or ten minutes at a time, to start, or you'll frustrate her. Have fun!"
Equestrian,3aqvw3,blooheeler,2,Mon Jun 22 20:49:29 2015 UTC,"This is exactly what I was asking for. Thanks!! She is so well mannered that she often falls asleep if I get caught talking to someone while we're going somewhere, and I usually don't even use a leadline. It would be great to build up more trust with scary things!"
Equestrian,3aqvw3,blooheeler,3,Mon Jun 22 21:00:13 2015 UTC,"Another one that sounds totally NOT scary but is:  The black hole of doom! Get a large sheet of plywood (thick enough so that it won't splinter when she puts weight on it) and paint a black circle about two feet in diameter in the center. Treat it like the baby pool. Step on it, walk over it, pivot on it, etc. If you've got a place to lay it in sand and cover all but the ""hole"" part, that's even better.   Edit: you want the square of wood big enough so that if she steps on it, one end doesn't ""pop"" up at her- 3X3 foot or so is big enough to avoid that on good, flat ground. Also, backing her up over it - or backing up anywhere that she hasn't walked through first, is a challenge."
Equestrian,3aqvw3,blooheeler,2,Mon Jun 22 21:33:23 2015 UTC,"Love it. Thanks!! Is it the texture of the wood or the hole part that's more scary? I have an old sheet I could paint too, and avoid any issue of it popping up/sliding around."
Equestrian,3aqvw3,J973,1 point,Mon Jun 22 21:57:25 2015 UTC,It's the hollow sound combined with the fact that it looks to them like it's a hole with no bottom. sheets are good too! Also good for blindfolding.

Equestrian,3aqvw3,carbonarbonoxide,0,Mon Jun 29 21:46:15 2015 UTC,"Houston Texas here.  It was 95 F / 95% humidity here on Saturday.  Welcome to SE Texas!  This isn't what you want to hear...  But seriously, HTFU.  Slap on some sunscreen and enjoy the sun and the sweat.  As my Grandpa used to say, ""Ain't nothin' wrong with a horse that a few wet saddle blankets won't fix...""  The rain has been ridiculous here.  A little sun was nice for a change.  I did 119 miles on the bike and got home and the horses were bugging me to go for a ride.  Saddled up and did another 12 miles on the horses in the afternoon heat.    I'm not saying that you have to go all Ironman on your 1st outing.  Just that you and the horses can tolerate a lot more than you are giving yourselves credit for.  Just make sure that you learn to check for signs of dehydration.  You can do a search for equine capillary refill and skin rebound.    Saddle up and enjoy the ride.  Your horse will thank you for it.  I know mine do.  tl;dr: We'd need a cold front to get down to 90 degrees here. O.o"
Equestrian,3aqvw3,carbonarbonoxide,2,Mon Jun 22 20:58:26 2015 UTC,"I would, really, but this summer alone I've passed out twice. Once on her and once while cleaning the tack room. Maybe I'm just not made for the heat, but as someone who more enjoys my relationship with her rather than training, I don't mind taking some of the hottest days off. It is miserable and I try to avoid things that make me miserable.   Edit: Also, I am fine with and do trail rides. But I'm a hunter/jumper by trade and I simply don't have the energy to take her over a bunch of courses in the direct sunlight."
Equestrian,3aqvw3,birddogguy,3,Mon Jun 22 21:02:54 2015 UTC,"Don't feel guilty for not riding in the heat. I'm very heat sensitive and have gotten heat exhaustion multiple times & passed out twice so I get you. I ride in the morning/night to avoid the 95+ days and honestly your horse will probably thank you for not riding for miles in that extreme heat.   Okay so onto the fun stuff. Horses can be taught SO many things with positive reinforcement (food!). People have been doing it with dogs for years and only now are horse people finally realizing how useful it is. Anything from picking up feet, to standing on objects, spanish walk, free-lunging, etc. Clicker training is the same thing. Also I taught my horse to ground drive when he was younger and I wasn't riding, that's a useful skill."

Equestrian,3ardol,Sarahdragoness,1 point,Mon Jun 22 22:03:58 2015 UTC,"My main beef with the gel pads are that they don't alleviate pressure points all that well- try putting the pad on your leg and then pressing a fist into it, and then try that same thing with a felt-wool pad. If the Impact pad doesn't let the pressure point just keep pressing, it may be worth a try. This is my favorite half pad to use with a poorly-fitting saddle (think narrower horses than my medium tree, or a cheap school saddle with standard/narrow panels that tend to be poorly constructed/balanced), even though it's marketed for ""wither relief"" I find it provides relief from a lot more by creating a more solid barrier between the panels and the back. What pad are you currently using? The Mattes Correction pad came to mind as it is also wool and shimmable. Or maybe a riser pad?  What's going on with the horse? Is it a TB coming back to work, lopsided from the track? Does she have a physical or training issue that makes evening-out her musculature difficult? Are you riding crooked?"
Equestrian,3ardol,carbonarbonoxide,1 point,Mon Jun 22 23:33:38 2015 UTC,"I am not trying to alleviate pressure points (I don't think?), so much as lift the saddle in the front. Tree shape and panel shape fit her well, just due to her conformation and tree size it sits pommel low. Even in a well fitted saddle I prefer some front lift otherwise I feel pitched forward and unable to sit up straight.   I tried an ECP pad similar to the Mattes design and it + shims was way too thick. Horse hated it. Currently I am using a Thinline pad with the Thinline shims. The shims leave dry spots under them. She seems happy though, working well, etc. I just don't want it to turn into a problem.   She is a draft cross. Was just diagnosed with PSSM in February. Spent most of last year trying to figure out what was going on with her. I could be riding crooked, but it's hard to tell if it's me or if it's her."

Equestrian,3anzxk,Sarahdragoness,3,Mon Jun 22 02:09:21 2015 UTC,"She's a cutie!  Based on your description, you might like Schneider's bridles.  Or, HDR makes a smushy monocrown.  I've also heard really good things about Bobbys.  Good luck with your search!"
Equestrian,3anzxk,Confidence_Trickster,1 point,Mon Jun 22 03:31:38 2015 UTC,Second Bobbys.   I used it as a schooling bridle and it was super nice and held up really well. I could probably have used it as a show bridle had I not had my Stubben.
Equestrian,3anzxk,altf4life,1 point,Mon Jun 22 04:27:34 2015 UTC,"I also recommend Bobby's! Their tack is great quality and also not priced out of this world. We've got a couple of Bobby's bridles, some side reins, and other miscellaneous pieces of tack and they all last and hold up to a lot of use as long as you care for them."
Equestrian,3anzxk,kateseverson,1 point,Mon Jun 22 16:29:11 2015 UTC,"Third Bobby's. It's not top top of the line but I think it's the best quality relative to price before you start spending ""used car money"" on bridles. And they're practically indestructible."
Equestrian,3anzxk,ellevt,2,Fri Jun 26 18:09:14 2015 UTC,"What areas are fitting too large, too small, or correctly? That will help us offer suggestions.   It's possible that you may need to punch additional holes or buy in pieces in order to get a proper fit. As somebody with a horse who is rocking FOUR different sizes on one bridle I understand the frustration! Some horses are freaks..."
Equestrian,3anzxk,AtomicPenny,1 point,Mon Jun 22 11:40:47 2015 UTC,"The side pieces fit her well, it's the noseband and brow and that don't fit. The noseband is on the very last hole, and is quite a bit snugger than I prefer them. The browband is also pretty snug. I was looking for replacement parts, but couldn't quite find the right color + the cost was getting up towards the cost of just buying a whole new bridle."

Cob size seems to be what everybody is selling right now! I am certainly not opposed to buying used, especially since the quality I would love to get is above what I can currently spend."
Equestrian,3anzxk,carbonarbonoxide,1 point,Mon Jun 22 20:15:29 2015 UTC,"For what it's worth, some of the higher end brands (CWD, Vespucci) run pretty large. I have a 17h percheron/TB and use a size 2 CWD (their ""small horse"" size) bridle on her just fine, and my horse size Vespucci figure 8 is almost too big!  It might be worth your time to take some measurements around the noseband, browband and throatlatch of your horse in case ""cob"" size really would fit!"
Equestrian,3anzxk,carbonarbonoxide,1 point,Mon Jun 22 21:21:38 2015 UTC,How is the leather on CWD bridles? Worth the price? I kind of shudder at spending that much though. I also really like Schockmohle bridles.
Equestrian,3anzxk,carbonarbonoxide,1 point,Tue Jun 23 03:19:42 2015 UTC,"Yes, worth the price! It's as nice and Harmohn Kraft and Vespucci and doesn't stretch as much as those brands. I have a CWD, and Aramas (by Harmohn Kraft), a Vespucci and a Five Star... (I also have a problem and too many bridles!)  I haven't tried Schockemole as I thought it was mostly a dressage brand... But I'll have to give them a look!"
Equestrian,3anzxk,SamanthaAshley,2,Tue Jun 23 03:30:06 2015 UTC,"My first bridle was a HK, they don't come up used very often though. Wishing I hadn't sold that bridle. The leather was lovely. Maybe I will hone in on looking for one of those. I had forgotten about Five Star, looks like they are mostly jumper tack. Their one non-figure eight bridle did not blow my socks off. Schockmohle is still mostly dressage, but they have some lovely brown bridles in their line now too. I tend to gravitate more towards bridles with a wide noseband for my girl, so I like their stuff."
Equestrian,3anbux,CMPRacer,14,Sun Jun 21 22:23:27 2015 UTC,"It costs a LOT and as far as key things, behavior can and will spiral downward FAST if you don't have the experience prior."
Equestrian,3anbux,fennecfox89,0,Sun Jun 21 23:13:58 2015 UTC,Thanks. I have a lot of help at my stable and people said that if I wanted to and needed help they would offer guidance.
Equestrian,3anbux,mrflossin,7,Sun Jun 21 23:25:48 2015 UTC,"Based on what I have seen from your posts you are years and years and years and years away from ever being qualified enough to bring up a foal. Go ahead and educate yourself, but know that as it stands, and within the near future, it would be a horrible idea for you to get a foal."
Equestrian,3anbux,mrflossin,-1,Mon Jun 22 02:01:19 2015 UTC,Oh I tottaly understand I am not doing it any time soon. I know I don't know enough and I am not ready I am just interested in learning that's all. And I am lucky that my coach just had a foal so I can watch her grow up and see what my coach does and ask questions.
Equestrian,3anbux,altf4life,5,Mon Jun 22 02:30:47 2015 UTC,"That's a good scenario to learn from. And it's not just when it's a newborn foal, you'll also need to know how to deal with a weanling, a yearling, the one- two- and three-year olds. Each should be at different stages of learning and knowing how far you can go without injuring them or overdoing while also not coddling them it is the key. It's a fine balance and raising babies is absolutely not for everyone because they WILL remember what they learn in those formative years. If you fuck it up, it will haunt them for the rest of their lives."
Equestrian,3anbux,HancockZaydin,4,Mon Jun 22 03:41:08 2015 UTC,"The most important thing for raising foals is to treat them like a grown up horse from the minute they're born.   They're cute and small at the beginning but do you want a 2-3-4-5 year old rubbing it's head on you or rearing at you in play or invading your personal space/trying to run through you?  Also- each them to pick up their feet quietly, lead, stand for putting on blankets and bathing before 6 months."
Equestrian,3anbux,deliciouslysaucy,2,Sun Jun 21 23:21:33 2015 UTC,"If you'd really like to get into breeding, ask if you can help out during foaling season over the next couple of years. Don't expect to get paid for this, or at least not much, unless they have a general need for a stable hand. There's just way, way too much to cover online, so getting in person knowledge is very helpful. If you'd like to read a bit about it, numerous books exist on imprinting and working with foals, though there's no hard and fast rule as to which one would be best. Those generally only deal with the foal after it's born however, so if you'd like more information about the mare during gestation I'd recommend trying to find a vet clinic in your area that does breeding work. Your barn owner likely uses one, or at least I hope they do.  With regards to cost, it's hard to set an exact price, but you are talking about easily in the thousands. Stud fees, mare care, feeding the mare, vaccinations, vet checks, veterinary care for complications, the list goes on and on. They're pretty apt to hurting themselves as well, so that's another concern."
Equestrian,3anbux,wntrwhte,1 point,Mon Jun 22 05:50:58 2015 UTC,Thanks my coach just had a foal.  Also the barn owner is always willing to answer questions about foals or anything. SoI have a  with everyone around me a lot of people who are willing to let me help when I want or ask questions.
Equestrian,3amvq2,davesan,1 point,Sun Jun 21 20:01:57 2015 UTC,"Sunnybrook stables is in Toronto, but you would be better served signing up for auto share or the like and going to a barn outside the city."

Equestrian,3amvq2,ConfundusCharm,1 point,Tue Jun 23 15:40:49 2015 UTC,"Agreed. There are MANY excellent places just outside the city. You could try posting on kijiji or facebook groups that you're looking for a ride - maybe you could meet someone who goes from one of the high schools/universities and they could give you a ride. There are ways to get close to some of the places by transit (and then maybe see if someone else who rides there could pick you up near by or take a cheap cab?), but it's still quite a hike if you're coming from right downtown. Depending on where in the city you'll be living it might be manageable. Feel free to PM me if you want any more info/help!"

Equestrian,3aj63n,diamonte,15,Sat Jun 20 18:32:23 2015 UTC,"Good on you for getting a pre-purchase done! A lot of people would assume a yearling to have perfect joints. It's sad for you now, but it's waaaaaay better then blowing your horse buying budget, putting thousands in board costs, routine vet and farrier care, new tack, and years of training (and of course love!) into her and finding out 4 years down the road she'll end up unable to do what you want, and getting hit with more thousands in vet bills. A lesson for everyone."
Equestrian,3aj63n,calm_chowder,5,Sat Jun 20 18:55:48 2015 UTC,"Agreed. Hearing this is reassuring. And it's a good lesson in not getting my hopes pinned on a horse too soon! This was a filly who I felt very confident purchasing (I have ridden several of her relatives, my trainer is friends with her owner and trained her dam), but there were issues that none of us knew about until the exam. The owner certainly didn't try to mislead me - she was perfectly sound, but who knows what could happen with the filly down the line."
Equestrian,3aj63n,stopbuffering,14,Sat Jun 20 19:07:51 2015 UTC,"Tell the owner that you'd still be interested if an x-ray was done to confirm it's nothing. They may be willing to do the x-ray, especially knowing that they have a potential buyer. I actually know someone who did this and the owner was more than happy to do the x-ray, since they were going to do one anyway if the buyer backed out since they'd want to know if there's anything really wrong with the horse."
Equestrian,3aj63n,ponies-n-tardises,3,Sat Jun 20 19:35:03 2015 UTC,"It couldn't hurt to ask. whats the worst that could happen?  My girl had some major swelling in her knee when I got her as a yearling. Turns out it was just cosmetic, vet told me there are surgeries that I could do, but since she was sound he strongly advised against it.   Her knee is still slightly puffy, you don't really notice unless you're looking right at it, but she's still sound (physically anyways, mentally is another story lol) and hasn't had any issues."
Equestrian,3aj63n,wntrwhte,2,Sat Jun 20 21:37:23 2015 UTC,"Just so you know, ocd lesions are not uncommon in yearlings and frequently resolve themselves with ample turnout and time. It may not be a reason to write off a very young horse."
Equestrian,3aj63n,mrflossin,1 point,Mon Jun 22 20:23:32 2015 UTC,"She lives outside all the time, so I don't think turnout will resolve it. =/ She passed her flexions with no problems and is showing no signs other than the swelling, so hopefully her owner will be able to pursue surgery and have a successful recovery, just not something that I'm capable of doing at this time."
Equestrian,3aj63n,Maggie_May_I,1 point,Tue Jun 23 00:43:07 2015 UTC,"Same place, I found a really nice gelding with a great show record, got to the pre-purchase and found out the owners were covering up a lot of his issues with bute injections. Without them the horse is nearly one hundred percent lame"
Equestrian,3aj63n,daydreams356,2,Sat Jun 20 21:49:09 2015 UTC,"I hate it when people do that. I tend to pull blood on high dollar pre purchases for that reason.   Although with this filly, it doesn't sound like the owner is hiding anything. Could just be a growthy yearling. I had one with an awful ugly lower hock because it fused early. He was 100% sound, and was stronger once it fused - most horses don't do it until they're older and it actually allows them to quit injecting. I'd give her a chance with x-Rays if she's nice enough."
Equestrian,3ak5e2,MyrtleLoadTheShotgun,4,Sun Jun 21 00:08:12 2015 UTC,"Personally, I'd just go for it. Perhaps lunge him a little bit in the new bridle to see how he reacts to it and gauge his response. Have you discussed this change with your coach? What do they think? I'd suggest just using a plain cavesson, no flash, and the D-ring.  If he seems okay on the lunge line, get on a go through a very simple routine (with your coach present, or someone else, just in case). Check your brakes, do some transitions, figure-8's, serpentines. See if you like how he feels off your leg and into the connection. Does he seem uncomfortable? Etc. Keep the ride short, sweet & to the point. There's really not a whole lot to do except try it and see, imho."
Equestrian,3ak5e2,kateseverson,2,Sun Jun 21 00:16:34 2015 UTC,"Ask the owner, because you have to respect his/her wishes, then just go for it. He's had a bit before so it's not like it's something he has never had in his life."
Equestrian,3ak5e2,carbonarbonoxide,1 point,Sun Jun 21 02:02:27 2015 UTC,"I recently transitioned a horse out of a hackmore to a bit. I really did not ask for much framing for the first month because he would balk frequently so forward and straight were bigger issues to tackle first and light/constant contact needed to happen. This horse was the kind to speed up as soon as the reins shortened. Once we got forward/straight/acceptance of constant contact in the skillset, I started asking for him to go to more round and keep a consistent frame at for longer periods of time at the trot. Then we worked on keeping his topline convex during downward transitions. My four-legged friend has some anxiety issues so he will grind on the bit when he doesn't understand or gets upset (I do the same thing so it doesn't bother me). I find that it is best to let him regain his composure and ask again rather than forcing the issue. This horse has sensitive skin and lives in the desert so I have to use petroleum on the corners of his mouth before every ride or I worry about his lips cracking/bleeding. He has a history of the bit causing problems but I am happy to report that the petroleum has been a savior!"
Equestrian,3ak2ll,andwhyshouldi,12,Sat Jun 20 23:40:21 2015 UTC,I do not ride with bits more than a French Link or snaffle as a matter of preference.   but is that the horse's preference? not all horses like or respect those bits. what kind of bit/mouthpiece was he ridden in before?
Equestrian,3ak2ll,_ataraxia,2,Sat Jun 20 23:49:17 2015 UTC,"Snaffle, he likes contact but hates strong bits, he refuses to move."
Equestrian,3ak2ll,_ataraxia,11,Sat Jun 20 23:51:36 2015 UTC,what has changed in his life? horses don't go from level-headed to high-strung for no reason.
Equestrian,3ak2ll,Brewskidog93,9,Sat Jun 20 23:53:34 2015 UTC,"Totally. My horse had ulcers. He went from cool as a cucumber to spazz, and after we successfully got rid of the ulcers he's back cucumber mode. Maybe it's something internal?"
Equestrian,3ak2ll,_ataraxia,5,Sun Jun 21 00:06:02 2015 UTC,"yea, a thorough vet check would be my first course of action in determining the cause of sudden behaviour changes in any animal."
Equestrian,3ak2ll,astrodog88,5,Sun Jun 21 00:07:54 2015 UTC,"He's only high strung at show and only really this most recent one. Though now that you mention it, today was the first show he's been to without any of his buddies. We had to share a trailer since my farm's broke down so I was the only rider that got to go."
Equestrian,3ak2ll,rebeccaeve1989,7,Sun Jun 21 00:34:20 2015 UTC,"Buddies make ALL the difference. We had to bring our boy's favorite little black pony to shows, with her owner's permission of course, just to get him to load in the trailer. We'd just lead her around all day like a dog, stand by the ring for our classes, and put her on the trailer home first. It's good exposure for the buddy horse, too.  If I had to wager a guess, I'd say he missed his friends."
Equestrian,3ak2ll,shh_im_not_here,2,Sun Jun 21 00:50:16 2015 UTC,"I can't agree more with this comment.  My old OTTB would jump 5ft fences from a stand-still (no exaggeration) when his buddies weren't with him.  He was usually calm and had a lovely personality, but he would rear and race once his friends weren't around."
Equestrian,3ak2ll,faiths_river,2,Sun Jun 21 03:47:44 2015 UTC,"My horse was hot at shows, then I started Ulcerguard and he's a lot more relaxed. The vet and I think traveling caused ulcers."
Equestrian,3ak2ll,ConfundusCharm,5,Sun Jun 21 12:48:21 2015 UTC,"You're putting quite a bit of blame on your horse:   he's nuts at horse shows/he's racing in the ring   Is this pent up energy? Or are you nervous and inadvertently making him rush around the ring because of your anxiety?   he knows exactly what he can get away with   Why are you letting him get away with anything?   If you're showing in hunters, a bigger bit won't look as good. Sounds like a good idea to either lunge your guy before classes or show in a few warm ups. I would just have your trainer show him before you. Or show him yourself in some tiny warmup or jumper classes where form doesn't matter. What's going to get him used to showing, or both of you, is to do it more often. Whether or not you can do that financially is the issue."
Equestrian,3ak2ll,NeverendingStarchild,5,Sun Jun 21 02:17:11 2015 UTC,I couldn't agree more. Find out what the routine at shows was with him before... Lunging before classes is a huge thing for most hunters.
Equestrian,3ak2ll,Kha0sThe0ry,0,Sun Jun 21 07:10:37 2015 UTC,"Trust me, I'm not letting him get away with things on purpose. But we are all learning and he likes to take advantage of little mistakes. It's either a perfect ride on him or you're in the dirt."
Equestrian,3ak2ll,dome_sweet_dome,5,Sun Jun 21 10:26:27 2015 UTC,"Was his previous showing where he was winning done with you/your trainer, or are you new to showing as a pair?   The prep some barns use (and may have used on him) could just be completely different from what you're doing. Have you tried giving him a nice long lunge in the morning to get some energy out? Most big show barns do that at the minimum for a lot of their hunters (accompanied with supplements/drugs like magnesium, chill, perfect prep etc.). If he's behaving later in the day like he did at the other show then it may just be a matter of energy and excitement rather than trying to be a jerk."
Equestrian,3ak2ll,horses_fart_on_me,1 point,Sun Jun 21 03:34:10 2015 UTC,"I just bought him from my trainer, who got him about six years ago from his A wins.

Equestrian,3ak2ll,NeverendingStarchild,1 point,Sun Jun 21 15:46:50 2015 UTC,"Magnesium is super risky since it will cause death if it is injected into a vein going back to the heart before being metabolized. It must hit an artery in order to be ""safe"" although I thought I read that USEF has banned the use of magnesium since my circuit days in the 00's. My first thought was that this horse was missing his morning dex for that ""cough"" the shavings at the show always give him ;) Technically its illegal to use dex off label but many trainers use it at competitions to quiet down horses whether or not there is a respiratory need for the drug."

Equestrian,3aejnf,ZzShorty,11,Fri Jun 19 14:03:28 2015 UTC,"I feel like I need to go back to square 1 with her.       Ding ding ding!  But it's not a statement on the quality of your training or a sign of anything gone wrong.  I find I go back to square one on basically every horse I ride, even ones that have scored well at big shows with very fancy pros and even horses that I was doing advanced work on the week before.  Go back to walk-halts.  Tons of praise when she halts off your seat and weight aids, quietly repeat any transitions that aren't good.  No fuss and move to something else when she starts to get bored or fidgety but return to these lessons as often as necessary until they're solidly installed.  Keep your lessons short.  Walk halts may seem like easy stuff but your horse's mind is still processing a whole bunch of things at once and trying to figure out what you're asking of her.  Keep everything as simple as possible and don't throw more stuff into the mix until she has an absolutely clear understanding of what you want.  You will inevitably have to return to these lessons again in the future because that's just the nature of horses and especially green ones.  You build on the foundation but you keep checking the foundation and making repairs to it throughout the life of the project (so to speak).  Keep her in the double jointed D and fix it with this bit in her mouth.  The fact that she runs through it is no big deal--it's a training issue and you can fix it. You don't have to change your hardware.  I only change a bit if it's physically uncomfortable for the horse and they can't seem to settle with it."
Equestrian,3aejnf,RonRonner,3,Fri Jun 19 14:20:09 2015 UTC,"Yes, you need to do a lot of transitions like walk to halt, halt to walk before you even move up to making transitions from walk to trot, trot to walk. I agree with keeping the sessions short to begin with. Start by lunging and then after you get aim to do a halt transition every X seconds for a duration of X seconds. Do as many of them as you can fit into a 10-15 minute session. The next day change the number of seconds. Eventually when she is responding to your seat not your leg or whip, move on to walk trot transitions. Trot to halt transitions, and halt to trot transitions. I have also found that a correctly executed turn on the haunches or turn on the forehand during these brakes and basics sessions are extremely beneficial.   It is a u/RonRonner says, you will be returning to these exercises constantly especially with a green horse. When you ask for any sort of collection, you'll need to return to this. If you jump, you will need to return to this. Any time you add or change things to what you are asking your horse to do, it is best to return to these basics."
Equestrian,3aejnf,mrflossin,2,Fri Jun 19 18:13:01 2015 UTC,"Exactly! Every horse, every ride, I'm either reinforcing that leg means go (immediately!) or that seat means whoa, or both.  Doesn't matter how smart, athletic, or advanced the horse, it's pretty much always the same. It's just that sometimes you can reinforce these principles in 10 minutes and move on, or sometimes it takes the whole session."
Equestrian,3aejnf,RonRonner,4,Fri Jun 19 18:21:13 2015 UTC,"Thank you!   That's what I actually started to do when I got frustrated yesterday. Just walk-halt and trot-walk. She DID get a little better by the end of it, and I calmed down a bit as well. I definitely think she picks up on my frustration too.   I'm glad something I thought of doing was right, I guess slowly we just have to build up the response."
Equestrian,3aejnf,RonRonner,4,Fri Jun 19 14:30:52 2015 UTC,"Smart! It sounds like you're on the right path then!  It is slow work but there's a very old adage called ""festina lente"" which means ""Make haste slowly"".  It's basically the lesson of the tortoise and the hare: you'll make more progress by going very slowly than by working faster than you ought to.  You'll be surprised how well things fall into place when you're a stickler about doing things the right way!"
Equestrian,3aejnf,carbonarbonoxide,2,Fri Jun 19 14:35:15 2015 UTC,"If you ride in the 3 ring bit with two reins, you can start to ""wean"" her off the leverage. ride with the snaffle rein on the outside between your ring finger and pinky, curb rein on the lower ring between your middle/ring finger. If you have a martingale, make sure the snaffle rein is on it, inside of the curb rein so you don't combine curb action with martingale effects. I now only use my curb rein for jump offs when I get her jazzed up and need to make tight turns, or at home where she is a bit more aggressive/brave to hold her to the right distance.   I have a powerhouse mare with a short neck and she had no brakes the first year I had her. I like to add a few steps of backing when I halt- mix it in with regular halts and maybe even a turn on the forehand, so she never quite knows what is coming after the downward transition, and it will teach her to wait. Your horse sounds very forward-thinking and if you do the same thing every time (trot walk halt walk) she will start to anticipate it, and you don't want a forward thinking horse to get ahead of you."
Equestrian,3aejnf,TheBostonLady,3,Fri Jun 19 15:33:59 2015 UTC,I wish I could up vote this numerous times.  Back to basics! Good luck keep us posted on how she does!
Equestrian,3aejnf,AtomicPenny,3,Fri Jun 19 17:10:25 2015 UTC,"Forward is actually a good thing. It sounds counter-intuitive but it's what gives you springy, responsive, transitions - upward and downward.  BUT heavy on the forehand, strung out, fast, ignoring the bit, etc isn't good forward. That's just strong and unresponsive.  As with just about everything, moving from behind, over the back, and into the bit is the needed base that lets everything else happen. Hard mouths can be fixed and are a learned response. If she got to that point then she was probably taught to stop by just being hauled on and didn't learn to recognize body and weight cues. You'll need to teach her that, and if you aren't sure if you're doing it properly you'll need someone to show you. I think bumping up the bit will only continue things down their current path. Like you said, you feel like you need to go back to square 1. That's it in a nutshell! Almost every horse has holes in their training, or needs a refresher, or a breather when they're in hard work. It's exceedingly common and people don't do it enough. Bring her back, relax, start at the beginning, and you'll find the root issue and rebuild. The end results and your sanity is worth it!  I would work on developing that contact and really getting her to move from behind and develop proper impulsion and elasticity throughout everything, it will in turn help all your transitions. If there is any way you can get a lesson or two with a dressage trainer or good hunter trainer to help you out with that ""feel"" and developing her I think that would be extremely beneficial. Your equitation is extremely important as well and someone on the ground to point out things you may not be aware of is very helpful. (are you pinching, sitting uneven, leg too far in front, unforgiving with your arms, etc, etc)  I'm a huge fan of lateral work, circles, spirals, leg yields, etc all things that really help them to get over their booties and rock back. You have halt, you have W, T, C. You can also create variations within those gaits. Don't ignore that in a walk you can have a medium walk, collected walk, extended walk, free walk, meandering walks. Ditto in the trot. Ditto in the canter.  For a horse that doesn't listen I give them a ton of things to do. There is no ""canter"" and then just let them canter along the fence for 3 minutes before I ask them to do something else. I don't leave them alone. I'm not harassing and micro-managing and pissing them off, but we do circles, serpentines, change direction, work that trot, bring that trot back down, leg yield over here, bump it back up, etc, etc. She can't get bored, has to start really looking for what is coming next and what you're asking of her, and these aids and transitions will get crisper, and easier, and happen more efficiently.  Make sure she has the best chance to do what you are asking by making sure she is moving properly and you are not hindering her. Then ask and demand that she goes where you want and at what pace you want her."
Equestrian,3aejnf,dunmorestriden,2,Fri Jun 19 14:31:31 2015 UTC,Teach her to yield her hind quarters and start riding with your seat and not your bit.
Equestrian,3aejnf,faiths_river,2,Fri Jun 19 18:48:14 2015 UTC,"A couple if suggestions as I have retrained a few off the track and know exactly what you are dealing with.   Teach her to lunge. Most ottbs don't know it well so you can work on transitions on the lunge line with side reins. Once you have her ok with sidereins do them up fairly tight. Ottbs generally get fast anxious and quick once the reins get tight and short so work on that from the ground. She will learn to relax into contact. Takes a while but works awesome!   This may sound crazy but tbs are raced with tight short reins. Soften your hands and let go. Make sure you are in a safe small ish area so if she gets quick you have control but push your hands forward and don't give her something to get heavy on. I used to ""drop"" my mare when she got super heavy and it used to back her right off! It would startle her because she had nothing to pull against! Once your hand is out of the picture she should start to listen to your seat and voice saying woah more clearly. Again doesn't happen immediately but works awesome!"
Equestrian,3aejnf,faiths_river,2,Fri Jun 19 16:48:49 2015 UTC,Thanks for the suggestion. I think a surcingle and side reins are in my future!  I will admit I haven't done enough on the ground with her this year. We did a lot more lunging last year and I think I've kind of forgotten how much it helped last year.
Equestrian,3aejnf,MyHorseIsAmazinger,2,Fri Jun 19 16:59:19 2015 UTC,It's so much easier to work on alot of things out of the saddle. Lunging helps to take the emotional frustration out and allows us to better see what challenges our horse may be having. It's not an all the time thing but when dealing with some issues really helps!  Best of luck!!
Equestrian,3aejnf,safescience,1 point,Fri Jun 19 17:03:21 2015 UTC,"I would suggest staying in the trot and walk until she's got those down, as many have said already.  My suggestion is to use walls and corners to your advantage. If you've been asking for a downward transition and it's not working, push her into the next corner so she has to. She'll soon learn that the stop aids mean stop. If she's heavy and pulling, circle circle circle."
Equestrian,3aejnf,palinodial,1 point,Fri Jun 19 16:23:15 2015 UTC,"She balances on you. Drop her. What I mean is when she braces against you, push your hands forward quickly and make her pick herself up. Chances are, you are riding in a skiing position so get your leg back under you and stable. Everything comes from the seat and leg, so if you are holding her in her mouth you are doing it wrong. Also, keep in mind, if she was a race horse, she was taught to brace against the bit and run. You need to be smarter than her. Don't pull, don't saw, but release your hands forward (and keep your shoulders in line...don't just pump with your upper body). Release from the elbow.   The other thing that works really well is work without a saddle. If you are gripping and out of position, you won't be able to handle her. If you are without saddle and cannot...well you are the issue.   I have had this problem before, so I am not being sassy...just speaking from experience. =) Best of luck."
Equestrian,3aejnf,CaliGirl16,1 point,Sun Jun 21 00:44:48 2015 UTC,"I'd try and lunge, get her to stop on the lunge with your voice. Then transfer voice to ride and voice back to aids. Also may be difficult with bigger pony but just a personal experience, I was doing canter to trot to canter transitions on a figure of eight then canter walk canter, and the 14h pony wasnt really listening to me, even in a dutch gag. So my instructor stood infront of him where I was meant to walk and we did canter, halt canter. After the fourth time of doing it he halted about 3m away from her and we did it the next time perfectly without. She said if you have the same issue pointing at the wall can help, if you're in an indoor school that is."
Equestrian,3aejnf,Jlop818,1 point,Sun Jul 12 21:36:45 2015 UTC,"Circles. Lots and lots of circles. Do not use the entire ring until she can canter around a circle in a controlled manner. Also, lots of walk-halt transitions.   Also, it is ok to bit up for a little bit until your mare respects what whoa means. She needs to be in control and running around the ring strung out and not listening is not constructive for either one of you."
Equestrian,3aejnf,nefariousmango,-1,Fri Jun 19 15:20:51 2015 UTC,"""Don't yell trainer"", yeah I'm gonna have to. Trainers are really important, especially with a young horse, and if you don't like the one available to you, you need to start looking for a different one."
Equestrian,3aejnf,Jlop818,3,Fri Jun 19 16:47:59 2015 UTC,"The only reason I said don't say trainer is that I don't want people diving down my throat about finding a better trainer. I'm aware of the fact that I need to find a better trainer, but until that happens I was looking for suggestions of what I can do in the mean time.   I'm currently looking but until I can find someone who is either willing to come to me, or someone willing to trailer my horse to their barn for lessons, all I have is the woman at my place."

I didn't mean to sound nasty or anything, but I do think it would be in your best interest.

I think most of the advice here is pretty sound though and definitely sounds better to me than putting a stop and turn on her to force her to stop.   I agree that you've got to take everything online with a grain of salt :)"
Equestrian,3afcof,hunterjumper2018,3,Fri Jun 19 17:54:45 2015 UTC,"A couple of the old barn cons don't sound like cons to me (a barn is a business).

Equestrian,3aeon3,sincerely-sacha,2,Fri Jun 19 16:53:17 2015 UTC,"Lots of trot for stamina and fitness, and lots of bending work. When I was young I had a coach who challenged me not to ride more than one side on the wall of the arena, so if I rode down the long side I had to get off the track and use the whole arena to do squiggles, figure 8's, serpentines, leg yield, circles, half circles. It was incredibly helpful, and sometimes a lot of time spent working on quality bending can help your horse. Also, forward, stretching, long and low. After that time off she might need a little more stretch so she doesn't brace and get that stiffness."
Equestrian,3aeon3,sincerely-sacha,1 point,Fri Jun 19 14:54:18 2015 UTC,Those are good ideas! I do sometimes get in the habit of staying on the rail too much- I'll try to remember this :) thanks

Equestrian,3aeon3,safescience,1 point,Fri Jun 19 17:08:02 2015 UTC,"Cavalettis are super for really getting a horse to use their hind end and back better. You can also really work on your transitions, quality over quantity! Incorporate some leg yield on a circle as well, to really get her stepping underneath herself. If you have the ability to get out of the arena and hack, that's also a great option."

You have to learn to move with the motion of the horse before you can learn how to ride ""still"".   On a lunge line, she would have me swing my legs like scissors (move them in opposite directions) in the rhythm of the horse's stride. I would do it at the walk and also the canter.

Equestrian,3a7k89,Summer_Frost,3,Wed Jun 17 21:52:27 2015 UTC,"I'm also agreeing with this!! In my experience, the lighter you are with your seat, the harder it can be to feel your horse properly (leads included). You really have to glue yourself to the saddle by learning how to sit deep while moving with your horse's motion. Honestly, the best way I developed the strength and sensitivity to have a good deep seat was to ride without stirrups. I know, it's not often everyone's favorite thing to do, but believe me, you will develop such a strong seat and such good balance. And just take it little bits at a time. I started off just trying to get three laps each direction at each gate. No need to try and do a whole lesson without stirrups right off the bat. But the more you do it, the better your seat will be. Best of luck!!!"
Equestrian,3a7k89,missbeeeem,3,Thu Jun 18 00:54:02 2015 UTC,I feel like riding without stirrups and/or the sitting trot helped me improve my seat for all the gaits quite a bit. Lunge line lessons like this were especially nice because I got to ignore everything except my position and how I was using my seat.

Your leg is super solid, you pinch with your knees a bit but I think that might be somewhat because of poor saddle fit. Are you very tall?   A little stiff at the canter, you could benefit from no stirrup work (can't we all?)"

That's still one of my bad habits I slip into occasionally. This is my friend's saddle (I hopped onto the horse just for this), so it's possible that the stirrups are slightly too short and contributing to the pinching some. I'm 5'4"", so I definitely wouldn't call myself tall. I have very short legs though-- my long torso seems to hide that.  I'm forever trying to work on relaxing and moving with the horse at the canter... I swear, I'm half robot or something. I'll definitely drop  my stirrups for longer as well! I try to do at least 10 minutes every time I ride, but I could stand to up the intensity.  Thank you for critique! I'll try to use your suggestions. :)"
Equestrian,3a8q4k,CaliGirl16,1 point,Fri Jul 3 01:48:26 2015 UTC,"I agree with much of what /u/fivefootnothing said, however I have a few things to add.   You have an excellent lower leg position, a heel so deep, I'm insanely jealous of it! I think your stirrups are a good length and your toes are out just enough. You upper body is good, however you're doing much of the work for your horse with your elbows. Your horse needs more pace and instead of moving him forward with your leg, you're pumping with your upper body. Try to move him forward with your leg and keep your upper a little more still.   You pace is a hair behind what it should be. At the height you're jumping, its not a huge deal, but it would clean up your course and perhaps take out the deep distances if you moved your horse on just slightly. I think the spurs next time will really help.   Great riding and keep at it, you're improving nicely!"
Equestrian,3a8q4k,CaliGirl16,2,Fri Jun 19 15:52:43 2015 UTC,"I definitely agree that the pace is too slow! I see what you mean about the upper body, I'll try to still it some.   What should I be doing to fix the elbows? I've been trying to follow with my hands at the canter, which may be why it looks so exaggerated. My arms/hands can get really stiff and awkward looking, so I don't want to take that away if I can avoid it.  Thank you for the advice!"
Equestrian,3a8q4k,altf4life,1 point,Sun Jun 21 18:40:05 2015 UTC,"As far as your elbows go, I feel like once you get your horse moving more forward, the pumping through the elbows/lower arms will stop. Remember, you should be following the horses mouth with your elbows. The canter has 2 major movements in the horse's head and neck. Forward, towards you and down, away from you. As the neck moves toward you, your elbows should bend at your waist. As the neck moves away from you, your elbows should straighten (not lock). Over exaggerating at first is just fine because that is how you will get the feeling, but once you have mastered what is supposed to feel like, you can quiet it down and make it less obvious.   Now, don't mistake bending at the elbows as pulling on the mouth when the horse canters. It should be a fluid motion that is part of the canter. I used to have the opposite issue than you. I used to freeze my elbows and never follow at all. I looked ridged and forced. Now that I understand how it is supposed to feel, my elbows are much better and follow correctly.   You're welcome! I'm excited to see your improvement!"
Equestrian,3a8q4k,fivefootnothing,1 point,Sun Jun 21 19:35:17 2015 UTC,"More Pace!  Honestly the rest of your course isn't a huge issue, but I was sitting here kissing and cluck through the whole video.   You're riding a big horse. S/he shouldn't be taking 8ft strides. At that pace s/he'll be adding a stride and a half in any line over 5 strides.   Work at a hand gallop or really extending the canter during your flat work sessions. Work on transitions within gaits (collected, working, extended walk/trot/canter). Make it unpredictable for your horse (don't just collect through the corners and extended on the long side. Switch it up or it will get boring for your horse!).  Also agree with a little bit too much motion/pumping in your upper body- but I feel like that's a side effect of wanting to get more canter.   Remember to keep your thumbs on top and a straight line from bit to elbow- your rein shouldn't be going slack and then tightening in each stride. Keep consistent, elastic contact.   edit- I just read the thing where you said this wasn't your horse so maybe my first bit of advice isn't particularly valid, but doing exercises to create a more responsive horse is never a bad thing ;)"
Equestrian,3a8q4k,fivefootnothing,1 point,Sat Jun 20 22:38:58 2015 UTC,"I completely agree! The pace is way, way too slow. Yeah, I think spurs would have helped, but I could've been doing more on my own. Practicing collecting and extending is a great suggestion, that's something I need to do more of anyway. I'll start doing those exercises on my own.  Ooh, I'll watch myself on contact, too. That's something that I'm not great at and could use some work.  Thank you! I'll remember what you said for future rides."
Equestrian,3a8q4k,mrflossin,1 point,Sun Jun 21 18:46:09 2015 UTC,"I can definitely see hunters in your future!   You ride very well, and your two-point is very good. I can think of a few things to critique.   First of all it looks like you were being what I like to call a ""passive rider"", as in you're pointing your horse at the jump but when it comes down to it you're just hoping he takes it. Make sure you're actively involved, count your strides and give a little kiss or squeeze before the jump. The difference between being a passive rider and one who is directing can mean the difference between a jump and a refusal. Don't forget that you give the horse the confidence to jump, and even a little squeeze can tell him it's okay to take it.   The other major thing I can see is that you tend to brace yourself. You're excellent at going into two point but you seem to have a tendency to hunch your shoulders and stay in two-point a touch too late coming out of the jump. I like to think of turning my shoulders outwards and to be honest, pushing my boobs out when I jump. Sometimes thinking of pushing your chest forward instead of shoulders back can help with the hunching problem.   Also hands! Hands up! And I always teach that they should be as wide apart as your waist. In this video it looks like you're keeping your hands down and close together. Now, each horse moves differently and prefers different hands but in general it would be better to see your hands a bit higher and a bit farther apart. I noticed this mainly on the flat; your release over the fences looked pretty good.  Overall pretty decent. Just a few minor things, I would mainly focus on pushing the horse forward (just because this particular one is lazy doesn't mean a little squeeze or kiss isn't needed, it is with any horse!), opening up your shoulders, and lifting the hands. You're a pretty good rider though, and you should consider showing in hunters or jumpers!"
Equestrian,3a968k,whatthefauuuk,5,Thu Jun 18 05:37:46 2015 UTC,"Hello fellow picker! In the future leave scabs alone. Unless it looks super interesting and you lose control of your body and it somehow gets peeled off..  If it's a run of the mill superficial booboo it will be fine.  I prefer keeping it open when they're inside, and slapping on some bagbalm when they're outside. The BB keeps it moist and soft when it's healing and keeps the wound clean (because everything will stick to that instead - it's goopy!)"
Equestrian,3a968k,AtomicPenny,4,Thu Jun 18 11:37:04 2015 UTC,"This! Most people like bandages and thick creams for wounds because there is definitely a psychological component to ""if I covered it, I must be doing a good thing!"" But really the best thing for most superficial wounds is a clearish moistening salve (like bag balm or neosporin antibacterial) and let nature do its thing. Scabs are GOOD- natural bandage."
Equestrian,3a625y,Sarahdragoness,4,Wed Jun 17 14:46:35 2015 UTC,"we have several saddles at the barn I ride at with name plates.  The ""barn saddles"" (for anyone to use, mainly lesson saddles) all have names on them, and only one of the names is someone we all know, the other two names simply came with the saddles and is how we refer to them so we can keep them straight (I used to use the ""Brianna"" saddle, but now I use the ""Natalie"" saddle).  Some of the girls have name plates on their personal saddles as well, but not all.  It's up to you really."
Equestrian,3a625y,AuntieChiChi,6,Wed Jun 17 17:23:55 2015 UTC,If it worries you buy two identical name plates and only engrave one.  That way you have one to attach before you sell it.  Nobody is going to be bothered by a blank nameplate on a second hand saddle. Somebody might be bothered by a spot where a nameplate used to be still being visible if the can't find the same shape with the same hole spacing.
Equestrian,3a625y,KarmaBankruptcy,8,Wed Jun 17 15:10:37 2015 UTC,This really is the best solution. A used saddle with a blank nameplate would be way more attractive to me than a used saddle with holes from a name plate.
Equestrian,3a625y,KittenVicious,1 point,Wed Jun 17 15:12:30 2015 UTC,"This is definitely my suggestion. An extra name plate will cost you a couple of bucks, leave it unengraved, and replace your nameplate when you go to sell it."

It didn't bother me in the slightest because I wanted to put my own nameplate on!! I like the nameplates because when traveling with the barn (to shows or schooling or whatever) it's nice that it's easy to identify whose saddle is whose. It also helps with last minute tack changes at shows if you have to send someone back to the stalls or trailer to grab a saddle, they'll know which one you need. In the barn I ride at, some saddles have nameplates, some don't. I see it all over at the H/J shows, and quarter horse shows. I think it's something that's classic enough where it won't become tacky to have one."

Definitely prefer the ventilation on my Tipperary..  Another tip: my forehead sweats a lot whenever im in the heat so to keep my helmet clean i keep a small thing of antibacterial spray in my helmet bag (you can get a travel sized can at Target or walgreens). I was getting bad break outs on my forehead and my dermatologist friend suggested it might be due to me sweating in my helmet and not cleaning it enough. So i spray it down after every ride and its helped so much!
Equestrian,3a60ad,Sarahdragoness,5,Wed Jun 17 14:31:32 2015 UTC,"I'd say just a leather halter and use the sheepskin covers wherever she gets rubs, worst case scenario, you might have to get new covers every couple of months. Buy some melp and wash them every so often to try to keep them clean."
Equestrian,3a60ad,mrflossin,2,Wed Jun 17 15:20:16 2015 UTC,"Leather halters are your best bet for breakaways. I use sheepskin lined bell boots, but buy 2 pairs so I can rotate when one needs a wash. Get 2 sets of the halter liners and some sheepskin detergent."

I also use it for my flats that rub the back of my ankles :)"
Equestrian,3a60ad,Wild_horses08,1 point,Wed Jun 17 18:51:40 2015 UTC,"My horse was out in an all leather halter, but then I noticed she was getting rubs under her jawline so I switched her to a cheap nylon one. I'm not too concerned with her getting stuck with this one on, since the fabric is cheap enough that it will break in an instant. You could get a cheap nylon one with a leather breakaway crown piece.   How good are you at sewing? It shouldn't take much effort to buy a little fabric and make your own halter covers with the kind of material you want. It might not look great but if you get a material that doesn't absorb water but still prevents rubs then you're set. Or you could look into things like these, http://www.bahrsaddlery.com/for-the-horse/halters-leads-2/halters/intrepid-halter-cushion-set.html  Sizing of the halter is also very important. If it's pinching him in the nose then it makes sense to have rubs. Maybe getting a size up would solve your problems? If it's too big in the crown but fits the muzzle you could always punch holes into the top.   Good luck!"
Equestrian,3a60ad,fivefootnothing,1 point,Wed Jun 17 15:25:58 2015 UTC,"I've had to play with the sizing some to reduce rubs. She use to get rubs EVERYWHERE. Now she only gets rubs on the top of her nose and behind her ears. I may try an all leather halter. I have one that fits her, just didn't want to ruin it with turn out. But if it works, it's worth a try."
Equestrian,3a60ad,SamanthaAshley,1 point,Wed Jun 17 17:11:03 2015 UTC,Biggest pet peeve: When people buy a leather halter because they think it will be more safe than a Nylon one. Which it is. But people always buy the 'triple stitch' or 'fancy stitching with padding' which all are made with super durable buckets. These do not break that easy if they get caught up on anything. Buy a basic leather halter. :)

They cost so much and last a year tops but they're so thin and grippy, I can't wear anything else :(  Also when I was maybe 10 years old, our cranky, ultra old school Irish barn manager insisted I only buy natural bristle body brushes for my grooming box (I didn't have my own horse then) and I'll be damned if they're not the best brushes I've ever used. They're this style, although not this one exactly: http://www.dressageextensions.com/ProductDetail.asp?KEY=15302  Splurging on high quality brushes and buying one or two a year for a few years has been totally worthwhile.  I haven't bought new ones in 20+ years but they're still the best I've ever used.  Nylon bristles just aren't the same."
Equestrian,3a4aa0,RonRonner,3,Wed Jun 17 14:34:29 2015 UTC,"Dang, do the Roeckls really fall apart that fast? I tried them on the last time I was at the tack shop and now really want a pair, but not if they don't last more than a year. They are too expensive for that!"
Equestrian,3a4aa0,Sarahdragoness,3,Wed Jun 17 14:41:48 2015 UTC,"Depends on how often you ride. I average 2-3x/week with a few shows a year and have a pair that are still in good schooling condition in their 3rd year.  The quality makes them totally worth it, IMO."

They're still totally usable but the grippiness has worn off where they come into contact with the reins and that's the biggest problem.  They'll also start to get slippery when they get wet.  No holes but also not quite as useful as they were when they were new.  Keep an eye out on ebay, sometimes you can find them for $30 which is still not cheap but not quite as what the catalogs charge for them!"

I switch to winter gloves from roeckl which I also highly recommend usually from November to March and I ride twice a week. There only damage mine have is from where I get them stuck in the buckle when tightening the saddle belt from above. I have no issues on the areas that grip the reins and I find the grip to be fantastic. Plus mine are machine washable which I love.

Not a splurge item, but I have a pair of Smartpak Solstice brown tall boots which I've been wearing 8 - 14 hours a day, 6 or 7 days a week (I'm a pro) in every weather for over a year, with no sign of them breaking down and no repairs needed, and they're STILL totally waterproof. I get compliments on them often. They were only $200, but they were probably one of my best ever horse-related purchases, and whenever they do end up giving up the ghost (though it seems like that will be a long way down the road) I'll definitely buy another pair.   I'm pretty much a cheapskate in general, but I need a good saddle and good boots. Most other things the cheap option will suffice if well maintained."

It has great padding on my horse's back, which I really like since he has quite a bony spine.   My elation platinum breeches - okay, so they're not tailored sportsmans (which I would kill for, the ones with the tan knee patches... drool... remind me to go pick up a pair), but they're insanely comfortable, and I can wear them as a high or low rise while still looking good. I've ridden them for showing and schooling, probably 3x a week (with two pairs) for over a year and they still look like they just came off the rack. The only thing is that the waistband in my older pair has shrunken a little bit, so it's a bit tight to get on before it stretches out a bit. I think that's more of a washing thing though..."

Also my Ariat half chaps. I am not sure which version they are, but they look like the tops of tall boots. They fit me like a second skin. I don't even notice that they are there, unlike other cheap brands of half chaps I have owned. I have retired my tall boots to show use only I love these half chaps so much."
Equestrian,3a4aa0,carbonarbonoxide,2,Wed Jun 17 14:40:24 2015 UTC,Were you having fit issues with you or your horse? My mare is WIDE and I struggle to find a saddle that fits her nicely.
Equestrian,3a4aa0,Jlop818,1 point,Wed Jun 17 22:25:56 2015 UTC,"Fit issues with my horse. She just kept growing, and growing, and growing. When I got her a year and a half ago she was just shy of 15.2. She is now 16 hands. Fitting her is made extra complicated by her butt being an inch higher than her withers. Everything wants to end up on her neck."

I'm looking to ride my tb sidesaddle in the future"

Equestrian,3a28f4,SpiritFairy,3,Tue Jun 16 18:56:58 2015 UTC,"I ride my Arabian sidesaddle, and he is a doll and a half. We started late last year, riding aside once a week, if that. Buy a proper saddle, I thought ""Oh I'll try a Hilason!"" No, why the hell did I think that? Do you put your worst rider on the worst pony you have- of course not. If you aren't going to make the commitment to buy a nice side saddle, borrow one! It makes all the difference in the world!  As far as people saying you need to retain your horse- not true at all. My horse knows vocal cues and he's never taken a wrong step aside. My friends horse is used to leg cues only, so she carries a whip and thats that. Take it slow and don't let them get lazy- if your horse drops their hip or shoulder you can feel it BAD, like you can taste the dirt in your mouth already! It's super fun, I definitely recommend it- go take a lesson and see how you like it!"
Equestrian,3a28f4,kizmet_,2,Tue Jun 16 19:17:47 2015 UTC,"It's on my list of 'things to try at least once.' I very nearly leased a horse from a woman who almost exclusively rode aside. She did all kinds of riding aside, pleasure, trail, parades, etc. I think she may have even done some competition but I can't remember clearly now. When I mentioned I kind of wanted to try it she was totally down to teach me, but the lease unfortunately was rather outside of my budget. I haven't met anyone who rides (or teaches) aside since.  If you have the opportunity.. try it! You may really like it. Saddleseat was also on my 'things to try at least once' list and now I'm a convert."
Equestrian,3a28f4,Synaxis,1 point,Tue Jun 16 23:16:22 2015 UTC,I would be too afraid of flopping/sliding off backwards on the right side! I would need one of the ones with the rail around the seat.

Equestrian,3a28f4,Jlop818,4,Tue Jun 16 18:16:22 2015 UTC,"Your seat isn't sideways, your hips are still open over your horses back. And with a proper fitting saddle you are just as secure and in turn should not be handicapping yourself. I have an arab who's go to is to rear, I can sit a rear in a side saddle just as well as in my hunt saddle. Don't knock it before you try it! :)"

Equestrian,3a4dn5,fivefootnothing,6,Wed Jun 17 03:27:47 2015 UTC,"What level are you showing at?  I think the key is to play to your horse's strengths (fancy mover, quite, rideability etc.), and figure out what their weaknesses are. Know when to show off in front of the judge, and when to blend into the group (if you have a horse with a stellar trot, make sure the judge is fully able to see it! Don't just go around on the track - use your quarter lines when appropriate. On that same note, don't circle much) The hacks are, after all, about the horse!  Show hack winner: All about showing off! Fancy horse who really draws your attention when they enter the ring. They can be more lively in this class compared to the pleasure hack. Make sure you work the gait that your horse is best at. Fine tune things like your extended and collected gaits - remember they aren't about faster or slower. These two can really set you apart in this class even if your horse isn't a 10 mover. You want more contact in this class - not necessarily a dressage frame, but work on having your horse move up nicely on the bit into your hand.  Pleasure hack winner: I wouldn't say you want your horse to look lazy - you want your horse to look easy. Quite, easy, and relaxed. A horse who loves and knows their job. Light contact - basically your loop and go hunter.  Road hack winner: Looks very rideable/adjustable. The horse should be moving with purpose if that makes sense?   As far as your riding style, do what works best for your horse. In any sort of hunter flat class (including the hack division) I ride in a light seat to let the horse show off and move freely. I find it makes the horse look easier to ride, where as sometimes if you are riding with a bit too deep of a seat it makes it seem like you're working harder and in turn makes the horse look a little less rideable. I especially find this true of the pleasure hack. You can still sit straight with an equitation seat and be light and soft! Work on just being quiet and letting your horse show off.  Also remember that turnout is important! Make sure your horse is nicely braided and you both are looking your best :) Hope this helps! Good luck!"
Equestrian,3a4dn5,ConfundusCharm,3,Wed Jun 17 04:25:46 2015 UTC,"I agree with all the above.  On the weight aspect I don't think ""bias"" is the right word. I don't know how overweight you are, people have different builds, a slim unbalanced rider is worse than a balanced rider who may be a bit overweight, etc. There are obviously variables, and it's obviously a touchy subject for most people.  However, this sport is about getting the best ride possible and showing the horses in the best possible light. We expect the horses to be in good weight, fit, and healthy. It is absolutely fair that we are just as rigorous with ourselves and keep ourselves healthy and in good weight too. It is a disservice to ourselves and the horses to exempt ourselves from that. So good for you for taking control of that and trying to lose some weight!! Keep at it and try not to be discouraged!   I remember years ago in the Practical Horseman magazine Jumping Clinic, George Morris told a girl to lose weight and the uproar was insane. But it's the truth. We need to be held to a more rigorous standard than the equine partners we expect to do what we ask. It's only fair.  In a class the ride is judged first and foremost.  If things are too close to call between placings turnout/appearance generally break that tie, and it is a possibility that a heavier rider could be bumped down. Just like a horse not being braided, or mismatched tack, etc."
Equestrian,3a4dn5,AtomicPenny,1 point,Wed Jun 17 12:39:35 2015 UTC,"Trust me, I'm well aware that it's not fair to expect my horse to work and I don't have to!

I'm rrreally proud of myself, but I feel that I have some basic skill lacking, because I've never jumped any fences in trot. I was thrown to jump these 50 cm fences in gallop the first time I tried jumping. And it wasn't like just a one fence, but the ""course"" was two obstacles and I had to change the lead on the first jump. I'm happy and proud of myself, but me succeeding was pure luck.   On those gifs I actually knew what I did and did something to get over the jumps. But I was still terrified in the beginning. As some of the other people who have left comments said that my trainer is pushing me to too difficult and dangerous situations and denying me from learning jumping safely and steadily. But as I said, I'm super proud that I went from absolute disaster to this (those gifs) in such a short time."

Equestrian,39xr9q,Quiinton,1 point,Mon Jun 15 17:40:01 2015 UTC,"If this is your third time, looking good so far! It's hard to tell from the gifs since I can't see everything, but there are a few things I can tell you. Taking it slow and steady is always good when starting out, this is quite a bit faster than most people start jumping.   You could use more release over the jumps - think about grabbing a bit of mane, or pushing your hands into and up your horse's neck as your upper body comes forward. You aren't jumping ahead of your horse, which is good! Crest release is good over any jump, regardless of size - if you get left behind, you'll yank on your horse's mouth, and most horses aren't so forgiving... my horse won't take a jump if he thinks I'm going to get left behind and pull!   You look like you fell forwards a little bit and let your shoulders drop just after the second to last fence (the one stride). Think about pushing your chest out and shoulderblades together. Good recovery to the last fence though.  You could do a little more 2-point though your course instead of sitting full seat - driving with your lower leg (inner calf) instead of with your seat.   Overall good riding, you have a lot of potential! And feel free to hit me up if you ever want some riding & weight loss tips - I'm also working on losing weight, since I compete and want to help out my dear small horse competing in the 2'9""s next year :')"

Equestrian,39wqii,jasmin356,5,Mon Jun 15 12:47:48 2015 UTC,"I would definitely call the vet and farrier and utilize them to help spread the word.  They are intimately familiar with what this horse can currently do, what type of upkeep he currently requires, what he may require down the road, and what his future could look like. They also know what people may have the resources, time, or inclination to do what he requires.  The word of mouth and personal reach of those 2 people is insane. All they do is travel around all day and talk to other horse people, they know a whole hell of a lot of what's going on at everybody's place. I've gotten a few horses after my farrier letting me know about them, people who were looking for trainers, etc. It's a million times more powerful than a sewing circle haha"

Equestrian,39wqii,RonRonner,1 point,Tue Jun 16 03:16:28 2015 UTC,"How's his temperament? Would he make a good pleasure horse for an aging ammie, a new adult rider or a re-rider?  Does he have a good brain for trail riding?  His physical limitations are only a downside to people looking to do things he's not capable of doing--if he's got a good brain, he's still a solid find for someone.    Word of mouth is great, so are the free local advertising groups on FB.  Just be upfront about his limitations so you keep people's expectations in check but play up his positives (takes a joke under saddle? stands like a rock for bathing, grooming, fly spray? Travels like a pro, no prep? Great with kids?)"
Equestrian,39wqii,deliciouslysaucy,1 point,Mon Jun 15 15:10:14 2015 UTC,"I'm so sorry to hear that he isn't sound enough to continue in work with you. What a long diagnostic road only to end up at this point. I feel for you!  If he could be sound enough to do light flat riding you should be able to find him a home, but from my experience in re-homing therapy horses who were ""honorably discharged"" it can take a frustratingly long time to find a home for a horse who is not currently sound.  I'd definitely mention it to your vet and farrier, and chiro or anyone else who works with him -- hearing about a horse from someone who's handled it is more likely to spark interest than hearing through the grapevine or via an ad. I'd also get on the phone to other trainers you have a connection with to let them know that you're looking for a light riding home for him with a particular type of rider (beginner? trail? training level dressage? husband horse? what do you think he'd be capable of?) and see if they know of anyone looking. Really, the more horse connections you can reach out to, the better. These horses with physical limitations or supportive vet care needs tend to move by networking better than classified ads, in my experience.   For me personally, I found it easiest to find good homes for horses that were good riding horses but need some extra care (corrective farriery, joint injections) if I went ahead and treated the problem to the best of my ability before bringing prospective buyers in. The cost of injections was always offset for me by the fact that I could get a non-working horse off my books a few months faster. If you expect him to be unsound for several months due to the hoof angle, though, it may make more sense to try to find someone who's willing to take on a rehab project -- in the past I've had the best luck networking through veterinarian friends for this sort of thing.  Good luck finding him a new situation. I hope it all works out without too much additional headache."

It's one of the reasons I've always really liked OTTBs, because for the most part, one of the only thing they really know from the start is going forward. Today, at least in hunter-jumper land (where I'm coming from), there is a total lack of forward impulsion from a lot of these horses; it's either trained out of them if they do it naturally, or never asked of them. I for one, would always prefer to get on a horse that's a bit quick, or maybe temperamental, than a horse that doesn't move forward off my leg."

Equestrian,39rjmj,spotpig,16,Sun Jun 14 01:39:03 2015 UTC,"Treat yourself like a young spooky horse. We tend to think we can just outsmart anxiety, but that's not the case; anxiety is too visceral. So, treat yourself like a young spooky horse. Train yourself, mentally. We would never jump on a youngster and expect it to do flying changes, no, we build up positive experiences in the horse by setting goals, slowly pushing its comfort zone, and making positive experiences.   For example, set the goal that you'll just walk around the agenda once, if that provokes anxiety in you. Or try to just canter 5 steps and be done. Did the horse trip behind to where you're not in a good mental place to canter? Do something else you enjoy and are good at so you end in a good note with a positive feeling. Even just having a plan and written goals will probably make you feel more confident. You'll get there!"
Equestrian,39rjmj,calm_chowder,5,Sun Jun 14 03:28:33 2015 UTC,"This needs more upvotes. Stop focusing on ""oh my god, I should be doing A, B and C like I did years ago"" and start thinking like a beginner- especially on unfit horses. Don't even worry about cantering until you have BORED yourself to tears walking and trotting figures with and without stirrups, focusing on basics like keeping your back straight, loosening your hips,  ""test yourself"" by feeling what diagonal you are on for posting instead of looking, do extensions and collections, do trot poles on a straight-away or an arc with extensions and collections (if you're working solo, an arc with poles about 1' apart in the center, 4' apart on the outside is a good way to ""adjust"" the distance each time you go through them).  By the time you are bored of that kind of thing, you'll be so eager to do something else, you will probably not even worry about what happens as long as you get to canter. Bonus- you and the horse will be plenty fit and balanced when you do."
Equestrian,39rjmj,carbonarbonoxide,1 point,Sun Jun 14 04:22:33 2015 UTC,Thank you for the encouraging words. I'm keeping a journal of my riding because it helps me think through my technical mistakes. I will start adding notes about the mental side of my ride and those goals I'm working toward (because that is very different than trying to ride a correct lateral movement or tracking my progress in smooth transitions between gaits).
Equestrian,39rjmj,CaliGirl16,7,Sun Jun 14 12:50:40 2015 UTC,"I am very much the emotional type rider you are. I have struggled for years and years with my confidence in the saddle, so you are not alone! I found the main thing you need to focus on and what tends to be my kryptonite is riding what you think is going to happen instead of what is happening. If the horse is calm, be calm and trust them. (Easier said than done, I know!) But every ride, push yourself a little bit past your comfort zone. If you feel a little uneasy at the canter, take it back down to the trot and work on lateral movements. Leg yields, shoulder in, circles, haunches in and so on to get your mind to focus on what is happening under you. Then slowly push yourself to doing a few strides of canter (or whatever is feeling uneasy that day.) and then make those few strides a full circle, then make that circle 2 circles and so on until you are comfortably cantering the entire arena. It is not going to be easy and you will take 3 step forwards and then 5 steps back, but your determination will pay off and you will regain your confidence in yourself and your mount.   We all go through this kind of stuff. Seeing a therapist may help, but the only thing that can get your confidence back is actually riding.   Good luck!"
Equestrian,39rjmj,CaliGirl16,3,Sun Jun 14 04:09:55 2015 UTC,"Thanks. I really identify with what you wrote. A little bit of ""just do it"" and a little bit of don't be afraid to take one step back in order to keep moving forward, just don't stay in a comfort zone 100% of the time. Again, thank you."
Equestrian,39rjmj,royallyred,1 point,Sun Jun 14 12:45:06 2015 UTC,"You're welcome. Don't loose faith in yourself. You have to be determined to get in the saddle and push yourself every time you ride. Its going to feel awful, its going to take a long time and it may make you very frustrated and uncomfortable, but keep going. I promise, it will pay off."
Equestrian,39rjmj,faiths_river,3,Sun Jun 14 16:23:19 2015 UTC,"Ride consistently, on a solid horse. Either a beginner's mount or another horse you know for sure is not nearly as likely to spook. Then you work yourself back up. You do various things while riding (patterns, circles, pole patterns f you are riding English, etc.) and if you freak out at one thing (cantering) you switch to something else (bending at the trot in a serpentine pattern) to switch it up and force you to focus on something else for a while. When you calm down, go back to the canter. If you feel yourself tense up, take deep breaths.  But beyond that? You either get outside help (trainer, therapy, whatever) or you suck it up. I've always done option two and I always feel better the second I force myself to do The Thing I was worried about. Now a days if I fear something I consider silly, I force myself to do it anyway. (Horse is super tense and trying to bolt outside? Little scared to canter while he's being an ass? Cool, we're cantering on a circle until we figure out that centering outside does not equal out of control gallop. That kinda shit.) I always found once I get over the mental panic I'm totally fine, and often feel silly."
Equestrian,39rjmj,crazycrazycatlady,1 point,Sun Jun 14 04:15:59 2015 UTC,"once I get over the mental panic I'm totally fine, and often feel silly.     Yup. I think part of my hang up is I get concerned that it is my fault the horse is acting up and ""forcing them""/correcting them isn't solving the root issue. I've been out long enough that I've got some weakness in my riding. The good thing is I can usually think through to find the root cause to some ""behavioral issues"": stuck hip making canter transitions sticky, sitting too far one way making lateral movements unbalanced and more difficult to hold the correct bend, not controlling the shoulders because I've let my right hand/arm/rein go, etc...  I've had some great trail rides on my friend's horse. In fact, I prefer going out into the woods because it means I don't need to ride through her arena issues. I need to remember most horses aren't going to go from 0-dangerous in a matter of seconds. And that they do have some sense of self preservation (not just going to come crashing to the ground together)."
Equestrian,39rjmj,deliciouslysaucy,5,Sun Jun 14 12:43:06 2015 UTC,I was in a similar situation. I owned my own training company and worked primarily with very challenging horses. I came off a few times and always got back on and did it again. Never phased me. Until I got thrown so hard from a clients horse I was unconscious for over 10 mins. Ended up being off work and riding for an extended period of time and getting back on my own two horses which I had owned for many years at that point brought me to tears.   Take it slow. Breathe. Get some supportive people on the ground with you. Take it day by day. Don't push yourself or put too much pressure.   The best advice I ever got was from my very NOT horsey husband who told me... you are in a sport you can do your entire life. You don't age out for competition or getting better or going somewhere. It doesn't matter if you have a few years setback because you can just keep going until you die.   I now live by that. I take every ride as an enjoyable moment. I love it. I breathe it. I make sure I can smile in the saddle.   Try to go back and remember WHY you want to ride in the first place.
Equestrian,39rjmj,KarmaBankruptcy,1 point,Sun Jun 14 15:26:28 2015 UTC,Your hubby gave fantastic advice. Thank you for sharing.
Equestrian,39rjmj,misskinky,1 point,Sun Jun 14 16:47:12 2015 UTC,I'm also a nervous rider like op. Thank you for sharing your husband's advice. I'm going to take that to heart!
Equestrian,39rjmj,uawildctas,2,Sun Jun 14 21:43:21 2015 UTC,"Regarding point 2, I have two recommendations.   Establish a very specific ""comfort zone"" you can come back to whenever you start to feel anxious. It will probably be a different thing on each horse you ride, as every horse is an individual in its training and temperament. For starters, do something like walk halt transitions. And then do more of them. Do them until you and your horse are both bored and your body is loose all over with no gripping in your thighs or tension in your forearms or shoulders creeping up. You should feel like you could do them in your sleep, and your horse is responding to things your body is doing without much effort and every transition you do is perfect. Are you anxious about walk/halt transitions? No? Good. That's your first comfort zone and you can come back to it every time something starts to spook you, or you start to mistrust your horse's footing, or you ride in a new location for the first time or whatever. The key is finding something you can do well, and then focusing on doing it as well as you can, every single time. If you feel yourself getting anxious do 5 or 10 or 20 perfect walk halt transitions until you get your head together. Then push yourself back out of your comfort zone again. Over time your comfort zone will change (trot-walk transitions, perhaps. maybe a few steps of leg yield or some particular figure) but it should always be something that's stupidly easy for you and your horse. If you can always de-escalate by coming back to something you know you and your horse can do well and safely, it makes those forays into harder or scarier things a little less pressure-filled. Try to train yourself to give a little bit every time you want to go into anxiety death-grip mode. Nearly every rider has a primal fear response that causes them to brace their arms or clench their legs or look down or do something else counterproductive to their riding when they get anxious. For some good riders this instinct simply isn't very strong, but most of us have to train ourselves to ignore it and even to do the very opposite of what our subconscious is telling us to do. As soon as it occurs to you ""I'm expecting a spook"" try to give a teeny tiny bit to your horse. Move your hand a fraction of an inch toward her withers. Unclench your butt cheeks. And say, out loud and with conviction, ""good girl!"" or whatever words you prefer to say in a reassuring voice. Nobody ever sat a spook better by tensing up than they would have if they stayed loose! It also teaches your horse that she can trust you in the contact when she is anxious about something. Horses need a lot more support and reassurance from their riders than you might think, and changing your system of aids by suddenly getting very stiff takes away the communication they're used to and leaves them more on their own to figure out how to react to potentially scary things. Everyone fares better once you can start to communicate ""business as usual; nothing to worry about"" through your aids in scary moments. And once your horse starts trusting you a bit and you get used to giving a bit, you might feel comfortable giving a bit more, and so on and so forth until your horse trusts you and you trust your horse enough not worry about the monsters.   And, of course, I recommend you work through these things as much as you can with a good trainer. Sometimes having someone you trust in the arena with you telling you you're ready to do something harder (or that you're not) really helps."
Equestrian,39rjmj,hotairballoon99,2,Mon Jun 15 02:02:32 2015 UTC,"Ride some good horses for a while.  Remind yourself that most falls are not hard.  I'm not really sure what you mean by ""tripped behind"".  I think it's totally reasonable to hate riding unfit horses that feel like they might fall over.  Horses that stumble in front and fall onto their knees should get vet attention or be retired.  Horses that are unbalanced behind or lock stifles probably just need fitness."
Equestrian,39rjmj,SheMork,1 point,Sun Jun 14 03:16:30 2015 UTC,"You are right, it is weakness behind. It spooks me and I don't want to canter her. I'd rather leg her up with walking hills and trot sets. But there is a little social pressure to get her moving, cantering (jumped her last fall, too) and I'm just not confident enough in her or my skills to help set her up for the best canter transitions."
Equestrian,39rjmj,throwaway224,2,Sun Jun 14 12:53:28 2015 UTC,"Consider seeing a therapist. It doesn't have to be some long term thing; for ""minor"" problems, three-ish visits can be very helpful!   The other advice is basically either just do it (which we've ruled out) or things like meditation and mindfulness to help you reach peace with the situation and bring back your confidence"
Equestrian,39rjmj,J973,1 point,Sun Jun 14 03:13:40 2015 UTC,"This is my situation exactly! I used to be fearless, get on anything, jump anything, do anything, but college took me out of the saddle and now when I climb up there I am anxious and nervous and far more afraid of getting hurt/hitting the ground, and feel so unbalanced, but it's so frustrating at the same time because all you can think of is where you used to be and wonder why you can't be doing that. I think the secret is to just try and dial back expectations and realize that you have to work back up to that. While it comes back like riding a bicycle, you're muscles and balance and mind aren't trained to that level right now, and that's ok. But I totally understand where you're at, it's frustrating. Just keep with it!"
Equestrian,39rjmj,J973,1 point,Sun Jun 14 20:49:27 2015 UTC,Thank you! And good luck to you as well. I am lucky and have found a great trainer to work with. Her attitude (and her horses) have really helped me calm down and be able to start my journey again.
Equestrian,39rjmj,Bjerksoffsen,1 point,Sun Jun 14 21:43:43 2015 UTC,"I recently got ""back into horses"" and bought a really sweet, super patient gelding.  I was really surprised at my lack of confidence with him, and I've found that taking riding lessons has helped me tremendously.   I was always one of those ""I don't really need lessons"" kind of riders (definitely didn't know on those who took lessons either though), but I am so appreciative of my instructor.  We are having dressage lessons, it's totally new to both me and my horse, but it's so relaxing and really fosters a connection between my steed and I.  I hope you find your confidence and good luck!  Don't forget to trust yourself!"
Equestrian,39rjmj,stripeycat80,1 point,Mon Jun 15 13:55:57 2015 UTC,Thanks! Right now I am only taking lessons. So I think I am second judging myself when it comes to correctly slight unruliness mixed with a fear of quick escalation (which was the back-to-back incidents where I wasn't told about a known severe reaction behavior).   Trust myself and also trust most horses to not be crazy. ;) Because most aren't.

Equestrian,39qive,MyrtleLoadTheShotgun,16,Sat Jun 13 19:48:30 2015 UTC,"Who is the owner? Are you full leasing this horse, or just half leasing? If you're half leasing, then there's nothing you can do on the days you aren't paying for, it's up to the owner. If you are full leasing, then it will be up to you to make that call.  Ultimately, I don't enjoy when I'm half-leasing a horse and the owner allows others to ride the horse for free, because then I might as well ride it for free. That's a conversation I've had with a couple of owners, and they've often realized soon after that giving their horse for free to somebody and charging somebody else doesn't make the person being charged want to keep paying for it."
Equestrian,39qive,sincerely-sacha,7,Sat Jun 13 20:02:20 2015 UTC,"Probably not what you want to hear but... If she's been riding him for 8 years and wants to buy him, maybe you should let her? Think how you'd feel if the situation were the other way around. I know you said you feel attached too but there are other fish (er, horses) in the sea and then you won't have to worry about competing with her to ride him or give him attention."
Equestrian,39qive,misskinky,2,Sun Jun 14 13:38:00 2015 UTC,"true, but it's currently the present, NOT the future.  Right now only OP is leasing, so depending on the contract, OP has the right to ride. If I'm attache to a horse that is being full leased, I'm not entitled to ride unless I purchase, or have agreement between ALL parties involved."
Equestrian,39qive,CarbonGod,1 point,Sun Jun 14 15:42:05 2015 UTC,Yes I do agree with that. But OP said the lease starts next week so I thought I'd at least mention it in case it could prevent drama for both OP and the other girl. Or maybe both girls could half lease? Shrug. OP knows the situation best :) I just think it's definitely best to hash out the issue know rather than signing a binding lease and just hoping  nothing goes wrong
Equestrian,39qive,misskinky,2,Sun Jun 14 15:57:00 2015 UTC,"It's what sincerely_sacha says, if you're full leasing the horse you are paying for those days so if you don't want her riding him, you can tell her she can't. I would do my best to not make trouble and make friends with her though. A person who has been with a horse for that long can tell you a lot about the horse that you might have to wait months to find out for yourself. Personally, if I was handling this situation I wouldn't say anything to her about not riding the horse, until she actually did it, and then I would tell the owner that's not what we agreed and it's unacceptable. Second time it happened I would try to tell the girl myself, in a nice way, that is not acceptable and it's not what I agreed to. Third time is when I'd cause that barn drama and tell her off harshly. Just be careful, you don't want to make enemies right off the bat, but if you have to get harsh, do."
Equestrian,39qive,mrflossin,2,Sat Jun 13 22:47:35 2015 UTC,I would a point not to say anything until something happens. There's nothing worse then being approached by someone who i assuming you're going to do something wrong....  Past that talk to the owner about your concerns.

Equestrian,39o9tb,HeelsDownEyesUp,3,Sat Jun 13 04:53:33 2015 UTC,"It sounds awful, but you just need to do it. Breathe and get it done. Same as getting through or any chore, a homework assignment,  etc. With the time spent doing nothing it's square 1. You wouldn't push a greenie that hard and  you can't push your horse that hard.  Have you been diagnosed with depression or anything like that? Perhaps therapy or medication may be in your best interest. I would at least bring up to your doctor. 6 months is a long time to just have no desire to do anything with them.  What happens with the horses when you are gone? You said you are trying to sell one of them before you leave.  Have you considered selling the other one as well? Or free leasing him out? 6 months is a long time for them to sit and then you are going to have the demands again when classe start back up. They're not going to be happy. You are clearly not happy. It's not fun for you. You don't enjoy it. You said it was a motivation issue (although I think it may be more), and if it was just motivation then you don't want to do it.  Maybe just removing the chore and guilt, getting them somewhere that they are being worked, and freeing you to reevalate what you want and how to achieve that would be best all around. Just put it on hold, take a break, and improve yourself without the responsibility of taking care of other living things. You can always come back to it."
Equestrian,39o9tb,AtomicPenny,1 point,Sat Jun 13 12:27:35 2015 UTC,"I would love to lease them... My parents legally own them and the farm they live on, so much of what I want to do with them is limited. My parents are not horse people and it's a sort of complex issue with them being narcissistic/""crazy"" people.  I meant over the last 6 months I free lunged them, but only rode once or twice myself. A student rider was coming out weekly to ride them for 3 of those months. I'm always out at the barn every day to care for them, but dragged my feet to do it.  I've been diagnosed with severe depression some years ago, I did a re-eval this year and they said I have generalized anxiety disorder. No depression this time except what they generally called manic depressive swings due to the anxiety.  It's probably the overall feeling that my situation sucks and I don't have much control over the horses. If it was up to me I'd lease them or have already sold the younger one."
Equestrian,39o9tb,Summer_Frost,1 point,Sat Jun 13 15:10:11 2015 UTC,"This seems to be what you're implying, but just to make sure: you can't lease the horses out because your parents won't let you? It seems like that really would be a great option if they're able to be convinced, but I understand that might not be possible.  I'm very sorry to hear about your personal struggles as well; it can be so difficult to feel like you're fighting so many battles, especially if you're trying to care for other people or animals.  It sounds like you need to be focusing on yourself right now, like AtomicPenny said. Horses are very in tune to our emotions, which it seems like you understand. Horses can either alleviate or exacerbate our problems, and I don't think these horses are helping you right now. You're only hurting yourself and the horses by trying to ride when you're so stressed out, especially if you're battling GAD.  As much as you love the horses, your mental health still has to come first. If you are currently in therapy, I would personally seek advice there for strategies to keep riding if you really feel like that's what you need to do. I don't want to discourage you, but it doesn't sound like this is the kind of problem you can solve without a professional.   With that in mind, I can offer some layperson suggestions. I think breathing exercises are really helpful if you are tense, as well as looking into stretches or exercises meant to relax your body. Pilates and yoga are both awesome! I personally like Pilates better because with yoga I felt too pressured to do all the poses ""perfect"" which could be stressful for you too (that may have just been my instructor).   You mentioned you feel like you get wrapped up in pushing yourself and your horse too far; it may be beneficial to start even smaller than you think you need to (there's no shame in setting very small goals, like tacking her up and hand walking without getting on, if that's what it takes). Write a specific list so you can follow a plan when you go out there. The objective is to let yourself feel accomplished and be proud of something you did with your horses!   I want to stress again that I believe it's most important to focus on yourself, probably with the help of a trained professional, and that might mean a break from horses to get where you need to be. Good luck and I wish you the best!"
Equestrian,39o9tb,Summer_Frost,1 point,Sat Jun 13 19:47:06 2015 UTC,"Thank you!  I attended therapy recently, offered by my uni, and had the opportunity to continue it over the summer, but decided against it when my parents found out about it and it cause me more grief. It's easier to attend sessions while taking classes and being on campus at the same time, I'll definitely be joining group sessions when my classes resume in the fall.  One of the reasons I end up pushing too hard is because I feel like if I go with small steps, I'm not making progress fast enough--- it seems insignificant if it took me months to accomplish a little change, when I could just force it in a week at a cost. But now as I type that and think it aloud I realize how ridiculous that is. I'd logically rather be relaxed with a little step in the right direction versus accomplishing something like a big leg yield with both my horse and I all tensed up in a short period of time. It doesn't help to have a big show barn next door that does the hard/fast route of things, I know they usually ruin their horses after a short period of time... but some of those horse and rider pairs look so pretty (ah yes, realizing it truly is ridiculous again) during that span... Or I try holding myself to someone else's standard, and get upset that my downhill built Paint and I aren't making as much progress as the next guy. I can sit and think on it now, I really would prefer to help my mare be relaxed and supple rather than go for the showy look we realistically can't do--- and is pointless, I don't even aim to show in anything beyond novice levels anymore at local events on a once-yearly basis.

Equestrian,39mc3t,calm_chowder,31,Fri Jun 12 19:16:38 2015 UTC,"I'd kick them out of the barn. If you catch them doing it I'd call the cops as well. I would also be calling all their parents as I assume the girls aren't footing all these bills themselves.  Someone is going to get hurt. Horses are going to hurt. What if they're drinking on your property and they end up smoking in a barn or something too. Nothing good can come of this, and the resulting bads could be immeasurable.  They do not have good judgment to begin with,  are wrecking that further when they drink, and I would not trust them on my property. Yeah, we have done stupid shit, but they are doing this habitually,  and actions have consequences.  They're doing this crap with zero regard for the animals that come first, sneaking around you for god knows how long, and you expect them to follow additional rules and nannying that you put in place? I get that you want to give them the benefit of the doubt, but come on  Also, the potential legal ramifications if one of these underage girls gets killed sneaking around on your property, or takes someone else's horse out and it gets injured, etc?

Equestrian,39mc3t,AtomicPenny,6,Fri Jun 12 19:34:28 2015 UTC,"I agree it's extremely poor judgement on their part, but I'd like to give them one chance (with zero tolerance for any misconduct, including breaking any of the new rules I'll set it for them). I have a very high opinion of one of the 18 y/o girls, less so of the other 18 y/o, and I'm sure the 14 y/o is just trying to be cool and fit in with the older girls. I do believe in second chances, and of course I have liability waivers and iron clad boarding contracts. However, their access to my and other boarders' horses, as well as their use of the property, will be severely curtailed. Right now I'd like to at least talk to them and see their reaction before I just plan to kick them out. However, any infringement on rules or attitude will definitely result in expulsion."

But if you care about them, and want to help them grow to be better people, I wold t kick them out.  Kicking them out will give them a bunch of free time, and guess what they'll do with their free time?  Splitting them up is a good idea too, I didn't even think of that!  Not sure if it was mentioned, but I'd let the parents know what you're doing and why.  And if anyone doesn't want to take the second chance you're offering, they can find somewhere else to ride."
Equestrian,39mc3t,deliciouslysaucy,6,Fri Jun 12 20:35:41 2015 UTC,"Wow. That's nuts! Your legal liability depends on what jurisdiction you are in -- most places I don't think you'd be on the hook for the underage drinking unless you actually served/provided the drinks. But should anything happen to anyone during these escapades, you could be in a very bad position, especially now that you are aware of this behavior.  Were it me, and were I a kind enough person to offer a second chance (not sure I am) I'd set the following conditions:  1) No alcohol on the property. Period. Police will be called for any suspicion of any of them being in possession of alcohol on your property.  2) No ATV on the property. If that's the girl's transportation to get to her horse she needs to park it on the road and walk in to the barn.  3) No riding your horses or post-surgery boarder's horse unsupervised (I would personally revoke all access to my horses if I were you, but you seem kinder than me).  4) No more back pasture riding for any of them.  5) Immediate termination of their facilities privileges and boarding contracts if any of these rules or any other facility rules are broken, or if any digital/video evidence should surface showing rule breaking.  I guess the 18 year olds are technically adults, but for the minor I'd make her bring her legal guardians to the meeting where this all gets discussed/signed off on. Good luck getting them back in line (or dealing with the unpleasant task of kicking them out if they persist in making bad decisions at the barn)!"
Equestrian,39mc3t,royallyred,3,Fri Jun 12 21:04:52 2015 UTC,"I agree with all of this, but personally, as someone who has seen a lot of barn drama between teenage girls and was ""raised up"" riding enough to see a lot of it first hand, I would have talked with the girls first before informing everyone. Kids like to blow things out of proportions, and while it likely is not taking place here, I've definitely witnessed kids lying to get others in trouble or kicked out due to a spat, etc. (Hell, I've seen adults at barns do that.)   I would sit all the girls down, say that someone (and don't specify who) saw them out drinking, and you want clear answers as the barn owner and person who is lending some of these kids horses. Make it clear you're giving a warning, but that there will be dire consequences for drinking on your property, around/on horses, atvs', underage, etc. Then after you've got both sides, bring in the police friend, inform parents, the whole shebang-but I'd definitely get the story straight first just in case. That way when you inform the parents,  you're clear you took the situation seriously, got both sides of the story first, and went from there. Not saying you should not inform the parents at all, but that getting the story from both sides could prevent serious drama ahead of time. If the kids proclaim innocence then call all the parents or hold a meeting, talk about what happened, and say in the future if anyone is caught drinking actions A, B, C, etc will be taken.   And I know that you are (rightly) upset but an attitude like this:   probably out drinking on someone else's property :/ )   Isn't gonna help you here, unless you want to kick them out straight away (and I wouldn't, not without hearing their side. It doesn't matter if they are drinking or not, as someone else pointed out, it's their parents you are going to have to deal with. Parents may very well side with the kids, if the kids proclaim innocence or something along the lines of a misunderstanding-and that can also put you in a bad place too in terms of reputation. ) It's a fine line to walk, but the good news is that you are doing something and reacting immediately, and will know in the future what to do if this kind of situation comes up, etc."
Equestrian,39mc3t,daydreams356,3,Sat Jun 13 06:05:30 2015 UTC,"The restrictions deliciouslysaucy suggested are how I would handle it if you kept them around. However, your business is on the line. If I were boarding at your barn and this was going on I would be out by the next month. Letting that behavior slide is a red flag to me on how other issues would be handled. They can board elsewhere, but it wouldn't be around me. If they were all 14/15... sure. But these are mostly 18 year olds and they know better. The fact they used someone else's property to do this tells me all I need to know about them. Even if I was misbehaving, which I did at that age sure, I would have never fathomed using someone else's horse and equipment. There is nothing wrong with underage kids acting crazy and having a drink behind the backs of people... it happens to almost everyone. However, by doing it on your property with your horses around your boarders, you are in for lawsuit material. If the parents of the 14 year old wanted to with a good lawyer they can easily say you were harboring misconduct and underage drinking.  I'd get them out pronto."
Equestrian,39mc3t,AtomicPenny,3,Fri Jun 12 22:55:28 2015 UTC,I don't know why you are getting downvoted for this.  I agree 110% - that people would happily turn a blind eye against that and trust their horses lives with people like that in the barn? I don't understand that.  I expect horse people to put the welfare of the horse first. And I expect a business person to put their capital and clients above the personal feelings of a few who are going around hammered and putting that all on the line.
Equestrian,39mc3t,AtomicPenny,4,Fri Jun 12 23:32:45 2015 UTC,"Ok, underage drinking is a serious problem and I take it as such, but let us be absolutely clear that teens flaunting the law and common sense as well and having a couple beers is not the same as an adult sexually molesting children, I mean... honestly. Not only does that insult good taste to even compare the two, but ""illegal is not illegal"",  as you said; sexual abuse of a minor and underage drinking are treated very differently under the law. Very differently. Let me guess, every politician you don't like it's basically Hitler too, right?"
Equestrian,39mc3t,AtomicPenny,-2,Fri Jun 12 21:43:32 2015 UTC,"Are they or are they not both illegal? The example was extreme so you could see that what they are doing is terrible. It is NOT a ""heehee kids will be kids"" situation that would result in a slap on the wrist.  Is a drunk kid killing a clients horse, when you knew they were drinking and taking clients horses, going to put you completely up shit's creek and ruin your business? Yeah! As is all your clients learning that behavior occurred multiple times and you kept them in the barn.  Personally insulting people because the opinion they gave you isn't one you wanted to hear is childish."
Equestrian,39mc3t,theawesomestest,6,Fri Jun 12 23:20:49 2015 UTC,"Look, say what you want, underage drinking simply cannot compare to sexually abusing a child. That's actually an insulting comparison to survivors of abuse or, quite frankly, anyone with good taste. Yes, they're both ""illegal"",  but so is J-walking. Things are not the same just because they're illegal, not are those things ""equally illegal""... child abuse is a felony, underage drinking is a misdemeanor. So really, not the same at all, morally or legally speaking."

Equestrian,39chur,hunterjumper2018,22,Wed Jun 10 21:00:50 2015 UTC,"They are actually mandated differently in every city. In NYC the are given a mandatoey minimum of 5 weeks off a year, with most getting several months. There are very few major accidents, and only a handful more minor accidents. People don't seem to realize that a good carriage horse is a huge business asset. Neglecting them is business suicide... They are an expensive investment at the very worst, and an owner's and driver's family member and friend at best."
Equestrian,39chur,b_pony,8,Wed Jun 10 21:20:41 2015 UTC,"I agree with everything you've said; I go to school in NYC and every carriage horse I've seen is in pristine condition, many looking much better than some riding horses I've seen.   We also have to remember that these horses are trained to do a very specific job, and that is also the drivers livelihood. Horses are expensive and not everyone can afford to have one as a hobby, and if they're unable to at least break even they could end up without a home or someone to care for them. I 100% support highly the regulated carriage horse business, because I've seen what happens to unwanted horses and it is usually much much worse."
Equestrian,39chur,Jlop818,3,Wed Jun 10 21:50:15 2015 UTC,"They are also well suited to the job, as they are tried and tested. People think that they're just forced to do the job...if a horse isn't happy pulling a carriage, they aren't made to stay in a place where they are unhappy or worse, if they are flighty or dangerous. Some animals are just better adapted to that kind of work. And their soundness and health issues more often then not outlive that of show animals. How many falls were there at Rolex last year?"
Equestrian,39chur,b_pony,6,Wed Jun 10 23:27:41 2015 UTC,"if a horse isn't happy pulling a carriage   I'm a novice whip, or carriage driver. This is the key element to driving horses. If a horse does not like pulling a carriage, or is scared by it, you are pretty well taking your life into your own hands by trying to force it. A frightened horse with a vehicle attached is a force of mass destruction- that's why breeds raised exclusively for pulling are so calm. And even those breeds have members that are not suited to carriage driving."
Equestrian,39chur,captcha_trampstamp,12,Thu Jun 11 00:18:47 2015 UTC,"I work on the other side of the carriage horses in our city - I don't drive them, but I work at the farm with them (farrier and beginning to dabble in some massage therapy and basic groundwork training for the newer horses). My experience has been that the quality of care is generally better than what you would find at a saddle horse barn, and the other people I know in the industry mostly feel the same. All of our drivers, and the boss (and his family, all of whom live in a house overlooking the paddocks) really do like the horses we have, and we actually have staff parties out at the farm (we truck ours in from about 20 miles outside the city).   I think we've had two runaway horses in the five years I've been working here - one from a taxi's antenna hitting the horse as he cut in front, and one from a motorcycle getting dumped and sliding into the horse. We're pretty serious about safety and training the horses/drivers, plus we do trail rides and shows at the local fair as ""hazing"" exercises, so I've never been worried about a runaway without being hit by something first. All of our drivers carry long whips, but they only get used on cars that come by too close :)   I'm willing to answer some questions if people are curious about any specifics!"

Equestrian,39chur,forwardseat,3,Wed Jun 10 22:51:12 2015 UTC,Some of those people are certifiable.  I will forever remember a comment one made about how a horse was being forced to work with cancer.  She knew this because she could see the cancer tumors on the horse's legs.  AKA horse chestnuts.  No amount of explanation could deter her.

Equestrian,39chur,throwaway224,4,Thu Jun 11 14:56:44 2015 UTC,"I don't normally see urban carriage ride horses but I happened to be in Philly last weekend and saw a string of them near Independence Hall and the Liberty Bell and stuff.  Being me, I looked at them critically (I own horses, start colts, thirty years experience, blah blah.) because I'm aware of the carriage horse issue in NYC.  The horses were spotless and in good weight (but not overly fat).  Their feet were properly and recently shod.  The harnesses and carts fit the horses correctly.  (I have a friend who drives and evangelizes about harness fit and cart suitability for a horse.  So, while I don't drive myself, I know what to look for on a hitched up horse.)  Also, the horses seemed calm and confident in traffic.  I was impressed with the standard of competence evident in the operation.    Horses don't mind work.  I don't have a problem with horses doing work as long as their working conditions are reasonable and they are well-cared for.  The horses I saw in Philly showed evidence of ongoing, competent care and appropriately-fitted working equipment.  Based on that, I'm OK with it.  I don't, obviously, have any idea how they are kept when they are not at work, but the horses I saw were healthy and in good shape so whatever is going on in their off time isn't harming them."

Equestrian,39chur,ajeansco0,3,Thu Jun 11 14:57:23 2015 UTC,"It's really nice to hear someone actually knowing about the facts before they form an opinion about the carriages, so thank you OP.  I used to give tours in Philadelphia.  I've heard a lot of different opinions, I was called an animal abuser on a regular basis, and I can't speak for every company in every city, but the horses I worked with are happier and better cared for than many I've seen.  I've spent my entire life around horses. I grew up in an area west of Philadelphia that is lousy with horse farms: show barns, lesson barns, fox hunters, many many private barns, even an Olympian eventer.  I've seen pretty much every end of the spectrum as far as quality of life and care with horses and I can attest that, especially with the very strict standards and how public the carriage horses are, they are very well taken care of.  The people who work with them love them and see them as partners;  Most of the horses at the company I worked for were bought through kill buyers and dealers, and most likely would've been sent to slaughter or spent their lives rotting in a field if they had not been given a job.  I'll never forget BB, every time they tried to retire him he'd stop eating, so two days week he'd work a half shift. All he wanted to do was pull a cart.  There were some horses that weren't the right fit, too, one during my time there who we found a home for through an old driver. An old coworker of mine is currently a driver in Central Park, and I try to stay as up to date on the issues going on up there as I can. From her experiences and what I've read, most of the people that are most vocal against the carriage rides seen to be PETA-style extremists who don't really understand horses, refuse the stables' offers of tours through the stables (they are happy to show people how their horses live and to teach people about them), and are being bankrolled by people who want that prime Manhattan real estate.  While I worked in Philadelphia, there were regularly protesters on the street. It was a vegan activist group who thought even having cats and dogs as pets was animal abuse. They showed pictures of our coworkers in an accident that was caused by an elderly man on OxyContin plowing through our carriages, saying it was our fault and they deserved it.  They say they care about the well-being of the animals, when they really don't know about the animals lives and the alternatives that are out there and refuse to learn. There are no magical fields for horses to play and live, there are tens maybe even hundreds of thousands of horses being sent to slaughter every year.  Even the Mustangs aren't safe.  I will always support the carriage tours, not only to protect the horses, but also to educate people about these wonderful animals who might never really have gotten a chance to interact with them otherwise."
Equestrian,39chur,spotpig,2,Thu Jun 11 15:02:26 2015 UTC,"I support it where it is done right (regulated). Can things be better? I think there is generally always room for improvement. But I've been to plenty large/tourist cities with carriage rides offered and, while I don't personally take a ride, the majority of horses I've seen are in good weight with good feet and what looks like well fitted harnesses. I've sat and watched handlers/drivers for a couple hours a few times (in europe where outdoor seating and long meals are the norm). I couldn't see anything abusive. I saw water breaks, meal break, and just breaks to let the horse rest."
Equestrian,39chur,blooheeler,2,Thu Jun 11 10:42:48 2015 UTC,"I was a carriage driver for three years. The short answer is that it depends.  Our company did not travel on roads with speed limits over 30 mph, our drivers were well-trained, and well experienced with handling horses in public areas. Our horses were wonderful, well-trained, gentle, and healthy. We monitored their heart rates and temperatures in the summer, took a lot of water and hay breaks, kept a farrier on speed dial, and maintained our carriages and equipment.  As a result, we had a healthy business.   Cutting corners in the carriage industry results in more accidents, dangerous horses, and lost profits.   That said, yes, we had accidents. The worst one when I was there was a carriage getting rear-ended on a bridge. Hard. One member of the family was thrown into the road, the driver flipped over the back of the bench and several straps on the harness popped apart. The horse was an all-star. He took off running across the bridge, saw that the light at the end of the bridge was red, and he stopped. He had some severe brusing but no broken bones. He was off the street for about 6 months, worked two weeks for Christmas in a park, and retired after that. The owner keeps all retired horses.   That was my experience."
Equestrian,39chur,jcatleather,2,Thu Jun 11 14:54:00 2015 UTC,"It is perfectly possible to use horses without abusing them, and most carriage companies are a prime example of this.  There are many examples of rampant animal abuse and I wish those people would spend their time, energy and Mo eye helping them instead."
Equestrian,39chur,liah,1 point,Thu Jun 11 18:18:10 2015 UTC,"I worked for one in a large Canadian city. I lasted a month before I quit.  The horses were kept in standing stalls that were always flooded with urine, water and muck. No matter what we did. Their hooves were in terrible shape, they constantly had thrush (they'd still work them) and a horse went lame almost every few days. They were worked eight hours a day with maybe a half hour break in between for water. They were handled roughly.   The owner frequently used us stable hands as personal servants to wash his cars and do other tasks for him that were wholly unrelated to his business, and only hired young girls who he would make awkward innuendos towards, like insisting we wear shorts and low cut tops 'because it was hot', never mind it being unsafe.  Honestly, for being one of the biggest tourist locations in the country, it was just awful for everyone involved, human or animal. I'm really surprised it's still going - the city loves its animal rights issues but this one flies under the radar, it seems.  It's the only job I've ever just walked out on. Abysmal stuff. I'm sure other companies are great, but this place really soured me to the whole affair."

There are zero guarantees anywhere horses and cars can come into contact. But in NYC/Philly, other heavily urbanized areas, traffic is generally so slow as to not be such a huge hazard to horses - simply because there's SO MUCH of it that you can barely get above a crawl in some areas."

Equestrian,39chur,deliciouslysaucy,3,Wed Jun 10 22:14:57 2015 UTC,"I am positive that the traffic that NYC and many other urban carriage horses face in their jobs is a lot safer than the traffic I and many, many other riders face if we ride down the road (e.g. to reach facilities or trails). Slow-moving city traffic with all sorts of scrutiny on carriages makes for safer conditions than the average rural road. If I had a dollar for every idiot teen driver who's intentionally tried to spook my horses when riding on American back roads... really even in rural areas most drivers are oblivious or defensive when it comes to sharing the road with horses. If this is the argument against carriages, then one must logically also conclude that all horses should be kept off all roads because of the threat of bad drivers."

His very patient friend here is the only horse in the stable that just patiently nudges him to tell him off if he's being silly.

My lease pony is not very polite to other horses so he gets turned out alone, he will act like a big bad-ass but when the other horse finally has enough of his talking shit, he gets the crap beat out of him...all bark, no bite!
