I've always enjoyed your little messages you've given. I even contributed to your kickstarter a while back, and one of the perks was getting a print along with the book. I'm not sure if you were inspired or not, but the print you sent me was exactly what I needed. So thanks for that."

Motivatinggiraffe,3clkp6,ppoppers,17,Thu Jul 9 04:22:17 2015 UTC,"I was wondering, have you considered donating a few books to local elementary schools? Your artwork often include powerful messages, and I can see how it would positively impact little humans in the process of growing up. When I was younger, I watched Star Trek TNG re-runs on tv every day. I didn't realize it then, but that series shaped the way I view the world. It became something as important as any instructor I've ever had, and I feel your books can do the same for others.   Also, it's really good advertising for future sales! There's no denying the quality of your work (person'd have to be blind not to see it), and parents/teachers will witness this first hand.  Anyway, think on it some. Think of the children! :D"

Motivatinggiraffe,3ch0ex,Dissonancesc2,4,Wed Jul 8 04:08:20 2015 UTC,"I find that sometimes you need to change that attitude a bit.  First you have to accept that you are sad. Don't try to get away from it, but embrace it. Something bad happened, so you need the time.  Then after a little while you start to accept the facts, and let go."

Not just about the message, which is in itself very nurturing and hopeful, but also simply because of how well drawn this is. Things like this are often seen as ""cartoonish"" though your drawings (like this one) have a very deep quality to the art style. The message resounds in the image in such a way that the writing at the bottom isn't even necessary."

Motivatinggiraffe,363lfj,khannie,7,Fri May 15 21:07:01 2015 UTC,"Adding to your thoughts on simply giving people smiles through giraffes (and not curing depression with them), the first one that did it for me was Giraffe sitting down under snowfall at night, and the words ""beautiful things exist"" beneath the image. You had drawn the figure facing away from us, and doing that gave it much more impact. We didn't need to see his/her expression because the connection has already been made. A sense of awe, and contemplation, contentment and wonder. Right then I thought this was brilliant, and knew it was special. For a picture of a winter landscape, it felt warm.  This happened on a particularly crummy day. I've had many of them back to back for a while now, to the point where everything outside my window felt grey and predetermined. Pointless. Right after I stumbled upon that drawing though, the air around me began to change. It may sound overly dramatic, but I felt a little more alive that day.  So I'm going to lay down some truth here, because I know tons of other people have felt the same way I have time and time again upon seeing one of your creations: You're amazing. Being able to touch people across the world by doing something you're good at, and something you enjoy. To uplift and inspire. There's a word for people like that, they're called artists. If you didn't realize it yet, that's who you are. So your Kickstarter success, funded by people that don't even know you shouldn't come as a surprise. More like the natural course of things. Something akin to physics, or gravity. Putting out that wonderful part of your soul on paper and sharing it is an incredible joy for all of us.   You're wonderful, and we love you. Keep on motivating the world."

Motivatinggiraffe,34bj64,raziphel,3,Wed Apr 29 22:54:51 2015 UTC,This motivating giraffe is speaking to me on some real levels lately.
Motivatinggiraffe,34bj64,Spokemaster_Flex,4,Thu Apr 30 13:53:19 2015 UTC,Penny is good at that.  :)
Motivatinggiraffe,34bj64,raziphel,5,Thu Apr 30 15:03:31 2015 UTC,It is always wonderful to get something off your chest.

Motivatinggiraffe,32db96,-rabid-,17,Sun Apr 12 21:35:53 2015 UTC,Actually it only picked it up for the toast. Then it'll put it down and lap out of it.  All good!

Didn't expect a turtle, but that expression on pig's face makes it feel as if Trevor's always been there.  Oh and yeah-- happy cake day Penny."

Motivatinggiraffe,31x315,4THOT,3,Thu Apr 9 02:26:05 2015 UTC,"This is the only illustrating I do (and I'm not at art school or anything) but I'd definitely love to illustrate a book, been thinking a lot about it lately actually!"
Motivatinggiraffe,31x315,4THOT,2,Thu Apr 9 02:40:36 2015 UTC,"Well it just so happens that I have a idea for a childrens book and fancy myself some sort of writer, would you be interested in a collaboration?"
Motivatinggiraffe,31x315,pianodragon,2,Thu Apr 9 02:44:08 2015 UTC,The next few months or so are going to be super crazy for me so I probably can't say yes just at the moment sorry! But if you're still keen on your idea in a few months please feel free to send me a message and we can have a chat :)
Motivatinggiraffe,31x315,OlorinTheGray,2,Thu Apr 9 03:02:34 2015 UTC,"I'm busy as well with finals, I'll try to get in touch over the summer when I should have more free time as well. Good luck!"

Motivatinggiraffe,31x315,King_Jack,8,Thu Apr 9 10:05:16 2015 UTC,My momma recently had surgery to remove a herniated disk that was sitting vertically in her spinal column causing numbness down both her legs and taking away her ability to walk. She is doing much better now but still on the road of rehab and has to use a walker. She's quite frustrated and eager to get a job again (she quit her last one because she couldn't walk for several months). But she saw this today and made her smile and reminded her that she is doing much better than before and is only getting better. Thank you for your work
Motivatinggiraffe,31x315,staticquantum,3,Wed Apr 8 23:55:20 2015 UTC,"You can do it, Trevor the Turtle!"

Motivatinggiraffe,31o4vs,motivatinggiraffe,107,Mon Apr 6 20:48:03 2015 UTC,"It’s a giraff-iversary!  Exactly a year ago, I posted my first giraffe onto my own Facebook page. I was stressed and tired in my life and thought I’d start drawing as a fun new hobby. Looking back, it was the saddest looking drawing ever but it was fun and it made me smile. So I drew another one. Then I drew a few more.  What a crazy year it has been since then.  I don’t know the real stats of Motivating Giraffe but I know I never, ever expected or believed that anything like this could ever come out of a silly idea I had on a random Monday afternoon.  So a huge thank you goes out to my friends/family who have liked these silly giraffes from the beginning, and all of the fellow motivation-lovers that I have met on both the internet and in real life along the way. I love you all of you guys and dearly appreciate your support.  Who knows what the next year will hold?  Bring it on.  Have a beautiful day everyone :)  EDIT: flashback to giraffe #1  http://imgur.com/n4l9VI9"
Motivatinggiraffe,31o4vs,Ucantalas,26,Mon Apr 6 20:48:34 2015 UTC,"For what its worth, that first giraffe is still pretty great!  Also, congratulations on one year! I hope for many more! You're an inspiration to so many people.   Have an awesome day!"
Motivatinggiraffe,31o4vs,jax9999,14,Mon Apr 6 21:31:48 2015 UTC,have you considered doing a childrens book?  you could self publish through amazon.  I love your giraffe and your inspirational messages
Motivatinggiraffe,31o4vs,startingover1008,20,Tue Apr 7 01:36:47 2015 UTC,"Definitely something I've been considering! I just have to think of a good idea for it, haha :)"

Motivatinggiraffe,31o4vs,pianodragon,6,Tue Apr 7 09:27:54 2015 UTC,"Many people in this thread have said many wise and nice words so I will try to keep it short.  So much inspirational stuff, so much funny and adorable stuff. In rough times it is the small things that can make a difference. Thank you for making a difference Penny & happy giraff-iversary! :)"
Motivatinggiraffe,31o4vs,BloodInMySaltStream,4,Tue Apr 7 09:51:40 2015 UTC,Thank you for making me smile every day!
Motivatinggiraffe,31o4vs,BloodInMySaltStream,26,Tue Apr 7 09:40:48 2015 UTC,"Penny,  Thank you for these.  I bought my Fiancé one of the books.  She works with adults in special needs as the supervising clinical staff.  Some days are hard, both for her, and her employees.  She keeps this book on her desk for the days she needs to be reminded things like ""She is doing great.""    While it may seem silly, your work does wonders."
Motivatinggiraffe,31o4vs,Rainyday156,14,Tue Apr 7 14:15:11 2015 UTC,Thank you so much my friend.
Motivatinggiraffe,31o4vs,TheRedUmbrella,13,Mon Apr 6 21:12:10 2015 UTC,"You're welcome.  And for what it is worth, both she, myself, and the dozen or so of her employees that pick up that book off of her desk after a bad day think that YOU are doing great.  Not just for yourself, but for others too."
Motivatinggiraffe,31o4vs,Ralston87,15,Mon Apr 6 21:15:54 2015 UTC,"For the record, if there was a motivating giraffe movie I'd watch the shit out of it. Just saying.  Also, I'm glad you came back. When we were initially notified of your being done with this project, that was... just a huge bummer. I've never been so down from coming across something on the internet. Not even smushed ice cream cones, or dying puppies compares! Everytime I visit this page now there's always other people here just like me, hoping for a brand new giraffe/pig to brighten their day.  So umm... We love you! Please  don't go away. D:"

It's everything that is good about people: just wanting to help someone out, make them smile, make their day/life that little bit easier and brighter. Just like that Monday when you first drew Motivating Giraffe. So thanks. You're one of those ""faith in humanity: restored"" types. :)"
Motivatinggiraffe,31o4vs,cpttravis,6,Tue Apr 7 02:22:18 2015 UTC,The drawings are awesome!  I put them on the smart board in my room to help motivate my kids.  They always smile and there is often a discussion!  Thank you!

But seriously, how did you know how to say what we all need to hear? Some days that giraffe has been the turnaround of my day. When it's not, I know you're helping someone else that day. I cannot even begin to express my gratitude for your time and efforts spent into giving us all a smile! Thank you so much, and congrats on the giraff-iversary!"

If anyone's curious why it says ""love you, stupid,"" it's one of those things my wife and I say to each other. It's from an episode of My Name Is Earl (awesome show). I've kept secret from my wife what I chose for the personalized MG, so I was excited when it came. She absolutely loves it, and so do I. So thanks, Penny!   PS: On the back of the book I noticed it says MG started in 2014. For some reason it feels longer. Penny, how cool is it that in just a year you went from drawing giraffes for Reddit comments to having a freaking book?! Crazy."

Motivatinggiraffe,2w8gkm,Rainyday156,4,Tue Feb 17 21:32:39 2015 UTC,"I think I really appreciate that ""they want to"" bit near the end. It's like you are accommodating your friends to invest in something that they believe in (you!).  But one of my potentially unfair anxieties is still the concern of what will they want out of me in return? I feel like a lot of times in my life ""favors"" have been followed by unreasonable, never-negotiated price tags. :("
Motivatinggiraffe,2w8gkm,jesset77,1 point,Wed Feb 18 02:56:20 2015 UTC,"If they're going to help you, it's not unfair for you to help them when they need it in return.  It's not a barter system, but it's just how society works.  Good people offer to help when it's needed and don't ask too much in return.  Yes it sucks that selfish people take advantage of this (either by asking too much or by not returning the help).   If what they ask is ""too much"", then you talk about it with them; saying ""I need some time to think about that"" is a good way to give yourself some time to think.  I'm sorry you've got to deal with anxiety issues and have been taken advantage of.  That really sucks."

Motivatinggiraffe,2w07ve,Gre3nArr0w,5,Mon Feb 16 00:39:56 2015 UTC,This one resonates with me. theres a girl I've been pining over for over a year and I haven't talked to her in months and I want to reach out but am nervous about what she will think of me.
Motivatinggiraffe,2w07ve,pinkhead,5,Mon Feb 16 15:26:07 2015 UTC,"My advice, for what it's worth, is do it.  Otherwise you'll spend the rest of your life thinking ""what if?"".  If you contacting her is going to make her think badly of you, then maybe it's best you know.  The things we regret the most are the things we didn't do."

You can get a copy here: https://etsy.com/listing/220986414/motivating-giraffe-book  Message me/comment if you have any questions etc!

As an aside, I recently implemented the whole Reddit RES thing where it allows you to scroll down the page for earlier posts (neverending reddit or some such) and went through all the earlier sketches and drawings here. Your art-style has improved considerably, while still maintaining the same amount of novelty and charm. It's great!"

Motivatinggiraffe,2u05nj,motivatinggiraffe,6,Wed Jan 28 20:56:33 2015 UTC,"I sea what you did there :)  On a personal note, I recently broke my ankle and yesterday I reached out for help from one of my coworkers.  I asked her to bring me a carton of cigarettes, and I would pay her when she got here.  Not only did she bring those, she also brought me some snacks and some juice.  When I tried to give her the money she wouldn't take it!  She must've spent at least $60, and it's one of the nicest things anyone has ever done for me."

Motivatinggiraffe,2u05nj,Rainyday156,4,Wed Jan 28 22:13:20 2015 UTC,"Learning to ask for help is one of the hardest things I've done in my life. I still struggle with it.  It always feels like an admission of weakness or of failure.   I used to think that it was pride, self-reliance,  or independence that kept me from seeking help.  Eventually I came to realize that it was insecurity-- fear that people would question my abilities or my strength. Being afraid to ask for help was actually a reflection of how I saw myself, not how others saw me.   So... help is never far away, provided that you're self-assured enough to know that it's ok to ask for it."

I know this sounds ridiculous to some, but without the prints and the letter and everything I wouldn't even do anything right now (at about 7PM!) except lying in my bed and trying to sleep.

But then I opened the inbox and saw there's something from Australia and I already had a big grin on my face! Just opening the envelope and finding out what's inside made me so happy like a small child on a Christmas day. Your prints, your kind words on the letter and the surprising bonus already made my day and this night and I'm sure it all will help when I have worse days in the future.  Thank you very much!

Motivatinggiraffe,2muefc,NEWSBOT3,5,Thu Nov 20 19:11:04 2014 UTC,"To be honest, my backup plan was even more simple and the same I use too often. ""If it doesn't work, throw money at it, until it does."" Makes life simple but expensive and me broke all the time. :-D  Luckily everything worked like a charm though, because of the nice people here."
Motivatinggiraffe,2muefc,Riipa,3,Thu Nov 20 19:17:35 2014 UTC,"hehe, yes, i was going to try and pledge more but with xmas coming up, i have presents to buy, not so easy to do, so :)"

Wut? No way. Hardcover or not, I want my book! Would have been more than willing to pay extra for a hardback though. Maybe for a future release with new sketches? In any case, really glad this happened, and super-excited about my copy. Awaiting the question, ""Where did you get this adorable book from?"" with great anticipation :D"
Motivatinggiraffe,2muefc,Butthole__Pleasures,4,Thu Nov 20 07:08:01 2014 UTC,"Depending on how this one works out, future releases with a hardcover for sure, that would be awesome!"
Motivatinggiraffe,2muefc,Ser_Davos_Cworth,8,Thu Nov 20 21:05:59 2014 UTC,"I'm almost overwhelmed with joy at this. And hard cover, soft cover, or no cover, I'm in this for the content, not the thickness of the cover. Really looking forward to getting this book and the personalized MG!  Hopefully this can get some sort of major publishing deal going, and I really hope you're able to pocket at least a little of the cost for your labor. You're doing something great here, buddy!"

Motivatinggiraffe,2m9w42,Butthole__Pleasures,11,Fri Nov 14 19:48:22 2014 UTC,"No, you're amazing, buddy."
Motivatinggiraffe,2m9w42,mylexie,8,Fri Nov 14 23:15:20 2014 UTC,"Hey Penny, I really want to buy a book, but are you sure you can send it cheaply enough to be covered if I only pledge 50 AUD? I looked at the shipping costs to The Netherlands and came to about 70 AUD! 0.o I don't want to leave you bankrupt, so could you please check how much shipping would be to The Netherlands? Then I can make sure I pledge enough."
Motivatinggiraffe,2m9w42,motivatinggiraffe,10,Sat Nov 15 09:31:58 2014 UTC,"Hi! :) So I've done a bit of research, thanks for pointing this out by the way, and based on the size/weight of the book it will either cost me $18 or $38 depending on how much it ends up weighing. If I sacrifice the hardcover it will be cheaper!  But! I know a lot of people in my own life that are interested in the book and elsewhere in Australia, where I will be able to just deliver it myself or have relatively cheap postage. So I'll be able to make a bit of money back there to help cover international postage :) Also of course I will put in any extra costs that the kickstarter doesn't cover and I've got a bit set aside to do this.  Really I'll just be happy if I can break even. And as far as I've calculated, I should be able to!  Haha sorry for the silly length of this reply, it has helped to write all of this out :) please let me know if you have any other questions or thoughts!"
Motivatinggiraffe,2m9w42,mylexie,5,Sat Nov 15 11:13:53 2014 UTC,"Well, what would it cost to produce the book? I would love a hardcover, really, and am more than willing to pay, and able to do so as well! So please tell us what my copy (or, for that matter, u/Riipa 's copy) would cost you to produce, ship etc. :)"
Motivatinggiraffe,2m9w42,motivatinggiraffe,9,Sat Nov 15 12:01:59 2014 UTC,After an incredible donation from a family member today I am confident I'll be able to do hardcover books and cover shipping :) this is going to happen!!
Motivatinggiraffe,2m9w42,mylexie,7,Sun Nov 16 08:26:51 2014 UTC,"(I'm not trying to be pushy or annoying, I just think that you should get paid for your work. And I'm doing fine money wise, so I can easily afford to get the book shipped etc.)"
Motivatinggiraffe,2m9w42,motivatinggiraffe,6,Sun Nov 16 10:08:33 2014 UTC,"Not pushy or annoying at all! :) I am reasonably sure I will be able to ship to Europe for $30 - $40 (depending on how much it ends up weighing), so $100 would definitely cover it."
Motivatinggiraffe,2m9w42,mylexie,4,Mon Nov 17 06:47:11 2014 UTC,Great! I'll pledge that then. :)
Motivatinggiraffe,2m9w42,mylexie,2,Mon Nov 17 10:17:09 2014 UTC,Very cool!   ...But how much does a hardcover and shipping to Europe really cost? Or is the 100 AUD option sure to be enough?   I really want to get my copy pledged!
Motivatinggiraffe,2m9w42,stormpooper86,5,Sun Nov 16 08:40:20 2014 UTC,I agree that hardcover would probably be preferable :)
Motivatinggiraffe,2m9w42,Snoron,4,Sat Nov 15 12:06:58 2014 UTC,I agree. :)
Motivatinggiraffe,2m9w42,motivatinggiraffe,3,Sat Nov 15 20:50:02 2014 UTC,"Out of interest, what do you estimate the weight of this book would be?"
Motivatinggiraffe,2m9w42,mylexie,4,Mon Nov 17 15:38:38 2014 UTC,"Based on other books around the same size, with a soft cover it would be about 400g, but with the hardcover it would be 600+. This is the dilemma, it would look cooler with the hardcover but softcover would save on postage for all!"
Motivatinggiraffe,2m9w42,yeldarbhtims,5,Tue Nov 18 10:20:49 2014 UTC,"This is a good point! It's a similar problem for me, as I am from Germany. :)"
Motivatinggiraffe,2m9w42,Mike_trollzowski,3,Sat Nov 15 10:16:58 2014 UTC,"I'd love the book, I can afford to buy it, so I'd rather not pay less than the real costs. That way, the money she makes off the ones that take less to ship can be used to ship to others, or, ya know, ensure she actually makes some money off of this venture... :)"
Motivatinggiraffe,2m9w42,motivatinggiraffe,8,Sat Nov 15 12:03:24 2014 UTC,You kiddin' me? Only $100 to make YOUR day for once? Worth it. Come on guys. We gotta do this.   Edit: 85 USD?! Even better.

Motivatinggiraffe,2m9w42,Ser_Davos_Cworth,9,Fri Nov 14 13:01:26 2014 UTC,"Awesome, thanks for backing the book!"
Motivatinggiraffe,2m9w42,khannie,9,Fri Nov 14 13:53:46 2014 UTC,"I have a suggestion - How about we each pledge some amount towards advertising on reddit? Let's say $5 each. MG is quite famous all over reddit, but many wouldn't be subscribed to this sub. It's actually cheap enough to advertise on the site. Thoughts?"
Motivatinggiraffe,2m9w42,sheriffofreddit,6,Fri Nov 14 14:02:45 2014 UTC,"For those people who already backed the book, this would be a nice way to help further. But... we would have to find someone who is a.) trustworthy enough to hold the funds and b.) is able to receive the funds. I've heard wiring money is quite expensive in too many parts of the world."
Motivatinggiraffe,2m9w42,khannie,5,Fri Nov 14 15:00:34 2014 UTC,"I was thinking paypal. I reckon the reddit team would happily help us with this. We all just paypal them some money and tell them to run the ad. Otherwise I'm happy to do it. I'm not a ""fly by night"" character. I'd also happily send the money to Penny to run an ad campaign. edit: As she will attest, I have already suggested this to her, just not in this ""crowd funded"" way. :)"
Motivatinggiraffe,2m9w42,sheriffofreddit,5,Fri Nov 14 15:15:56 2014 UTC,Let me know if she agrees and I will also send her some ad moneys. What about asking her to accept the magic internet money otherwise known as Bitcoin (or even Dogecoin)? I'm sure many in those subreddits (/r/bitcoin and /r/dogecoin) would be more than glad to pledge and support this.
Motivatinggiraffe,2m9w42,dolorismachina,3,Fri Nov 14 15:44:14 2014 UTC,Great idea. I just sub'd to dogecoin the other day. They seem like a very friendly bunch. :)
Motivatinggiraffe,2m9w42,sheriffofreddit,10,Sat Nov 15 00:29:52 2014 UTC,I'm an American and would like to back this but I don't know how to donate in kangaroo dollars?  Anyone know what I do? I've never backed a kickstarter before.
Motivatinggiraffe,2m9w42,dolorismachina,9,Sat Nov 15 01:14:53 2014 UTC,Paypal will do the conversion for you. :)
Motivatinggiraffe,2m9w42,Butthole__Pleasures,5,Fri Nov 14 16:11:13 2014 UTC,Cool! I'm gonna set one up! Thanks!
Motivatinggiraffe,2m9w42,dolorismachina,2,Fri Nov 14 16:23:23 2014 UTC,Just don't let paypal do the conversion for you. Their rates are a rip off.
Motivatinggiraffe,2m9w42,Butthole__Pleasures,2,Fri Nov 14 16:47:27 2014 UTC,What do I do then?
Motivatinggiraffe,2m9w42,boobsyadigg,2,Fri Nov 14 19:08:43 2014 UTC,"There should be an option that says something in the line of ""I don't want Paypal to handle conversion"". This way your bank will take care of it. I can't remember how it looked exactly but it shouldn't be hard to see."
Motivatinggiraffe,2m9w42,Ucantalas,3,Fri Nov 14 19:15:20 2014 UTC,"With my bank, it's a flat 1% conversion fee, which is quite nice. It shows up as a charge from overseas followed by a 1% charge that looks similar on the transaction history. I'm guessing it's similar for a lot of banks/credit cards."
Motivatinggiraffe,2m9w42,boobsyadigg,3,Fri Nov 14 19:51:59 2014 UTC,I was talking about exchange rates. The ones used by Paypal are usually pretty bad. I don't know if there's an additional fee but I wouldn't be surprised.
Motivatinggiraffe,2m9w42,NEWSBOT3,4,Fri Nov 14 23:16:45 2014 UTC,"Yeah, I'm agreeing. I'm saying that the 1% from Visa is probably a lot better than whatever PayPal will charge you."
Motivatinggiraffe,2m9w42,motivatinggiraffe,4,Sat Nov 15 02:05:41 2014 UTC,I'm having trouble with my card being accepted. Did you have any problems?
Motivatinggiraffe,2m9w42,rodion3,3,Sat Nov 15 02:10:57 2014 UTC,"I don't know if you saw this, or even if you're not Australian, but elsewhere in this thread /u/joshguillen said:   To 'Murican contributors: I had to contact my bank before the payment was permitted as this registered as a foreign transaction.

Motivatinggiraffe,2m9w42,RuleofThird,5,Fri Nov 14 18:05:58 2014 UTC,I did not but it does explain a lot thanks!
Motivatinggiraffe,2m9w42,NEWSBOT3,14,Sat Nov 15 02:28:31 2014 UTC,"backed and shared. I really hope this happens, this level of talent has to be seen more, and the ability to have a book at home that i can just flip open when im having a crap day and have some awesome work motivate me, that's worth paying for.  edit : i posted to /r/kickstarter about it.  edit2 : posted to /r/crowdfundingprojects and /r/theredlion as well.  hopefully over the weekend it'll zoom along :D  edit3 : YES COME ON.

Motivatinggiraffe,2m9w42,lostcannoli,10,Sat Nov 15 03:05:50 2014 UTC,When was the kickstarter originally announced?  I only learned of it a day or two ago through a second-hand comment on a post here.  I'd have sponsored it a lot sooner (and spread the word earlier) if I'd known about it when it started!

Personalized MG artwork? O_O I almost squealed like a little girl, and am not ashamed to admit it.  Can we request a specific theme?"
Motivatinggiraffe,2k162q,idrinkcoldcoffee,7,Thu Oct 23 01:40:23 2014 UTC,You can request whatever you'd like!! :)
Motivatinggiraffe,2k162q,Lelantas,3,Thu Oct 23 01:42:30 2014 UTC,That's great! :D  Umm... how do I go about doing that? Should I contact you on the kickstarter site? I've never used it before now so am unsure of how everything works.
Motivatinggiraffe,2k162q,deathbymurder33,6,Thu Oct 23 02:04:31 2014 UTC,"I think how it works is, once the campaign is over (30 days), if it raises enough funds then the rewards go ahead. So if we make it, I'll send you a message in 30 days and do up your personalised giraffe!"
Motivatinggiraffe,2k162q,mwatson44,3,Thu Oct 23 02:11:02 2014 UTC,"Oh I see-- yay! Tnx for the info.  In any case, I submitted a pledge a little while ago and can't wait for this project to happen.

Pledged a little nonetheless, it's the least I can do."

There's not many people that want to spread that sort of thing around.  If you do publish a book, I'll be sure to buy it. Not only because I was subscribed to this subreddit, your that I upvote everything you post, I'll keep it as a reminder that people like you exist.  Live your life, grasp any opportunities you get your hands hooves on, and remember, if you're having a hard time, a bad day, you have over four thousand people to turn to. We're all here.  Goodbye Penny, thanks for the Giraffes.  Edit: I drew the picture during Chemistry. Look! You can see the outline of a covalent bond to the left of the giraffes!"

Sometimes it seems like there's not enough people like you in our world; and even when there are, they don't often get the credit they deserve.   Keep those emotions, make them inspire you to do great things.   I love this.  Not all emotions are enjoyable ones, but we would no longer notice the pleasant times if we never had unpleasant times.  This year I've been trying to embrace all my emotions.  It's not always easy, but it's ends up being so fulfilling.  Your comment was wonderfully encouraging.  Again, thank you."

Motivatinggiraffe,2jn5mo,FrownUpsideDownBot,8,Sun Oct 19 03:20:18 2014 UTC,"Have you considered using Kickstarter to fund the coffee table book? You have a huge network who can all pitch in a little bit, and it would be a great first step into pro illustration! If you do, just send the link out to all of us (blog, subreddit, etc) and see what happens! think about it!  Edit/addition - you can use the money raised in Kickstarter as salary while you're working on the book and not on other paying occupations you might otherwise be doing, as well as to fund a few print runs to see how you want the book to be before you make a bunch. People pledge different amounts, and they get rewards for different sized pledges, so one of the bigger pledge levels could be the book itself, maybe signed by you or something. And a smaller pledge level could be a single giraffe comic printed and signed. Etc etc. Woo!"

One day, frustrated with everything, I changed my wallpaper to a rotating montage of motivating giraffes. Occasionally seeing your illustrations and messages made me feel so much better and got me through the dark tunnel. From my heart; thank you <3  I imagine it must be grueling to keep producing art on a daily basis on addition to everything else, on the other hand we do miss your surprise paintings on askredddit. Do stay, and chat with us sometimes. I'd love to hear about the photo book and even the children's book X years later :)  All the best, and chin up!  XOXO"

I loved making every picture, but I found myself really stretched for ideas lately, and I think it's probably better to wind it up rather than keep making them but at a lesser standard!   But I love the idea now that I can just draw anything, it's like a whole new world to explore. Just have to see where it goes :) thank you!!"

Motivatinggiraffe,2jn5mo,SOPA_NO,2,Sun Oct 19 05:22:55 2014 UTC,"Reddit has so many unsavoury characters of various types that I was starting to lose my faith in the internet, and possibly even in humanity as a whole.  But then, out of left field, was a cheerful giraffe picture hand-drawn to respond to some off-hand comment.  And it really affected me a lot.  And then I saw it happening more often.  Each time I couldn't help but smile.  I'm glad there are beautiful people like you in this world, and I thank you so much for keeping me from losing sight of that fact.  We'll all miss you, of course.  I'm looking forward to learning more about the Motivating Giraffe coffee table book.  I hope that, when appropriate and tasteful, you'll add a bit of context into what prompted the picture, and maybe what motivated you to draw it.  One of my favourites in that regard was when someone's comment described someone as being as graceful as a giraffe on ice skates, and the next thing I know, there's a giraffe on ice skates, telling me I can do anything!  I wish I could find the link to it now."

Motivatinggiraffe,2hd402,tatertot255,6,Thu Sep 25 03:32:34 2014 UTC,"Hey bud,   I am also a child of divorce. So I'm not gonna lie, this shit sucks and is hard. But, believe you me, family remains family. The only thing that changes is that you will have a separate relationship when it comes to your parents.  My advice to you is not to take sides and tell your parents that you will not accept them talking badly about each other when you are there.  If you are in need of talking or advice, shoot me a PM and I will be more happy to help."

Yall need to learn about giraffes, they are the coolest darn animals ever!  I haven't really been around the rest of Reddit for the past couple of months with my silly user-specific giraffes, and to the ones who miss that I do apologise! A few personal issues have kind of dragged me back into the real world, and to be honest I'm not sure when I'll be able to return to what I was doing before (I'm hoping things will be a bit less crazy once uni lets out for summer in November, so we'll see). But doing one giraffe a day and putting them up here and the blog has been super therapeutic and fun for me personally, so for the foreseeable future I will keep uploading them for you :)   Thanks for sticking by me guys. When life gets a bit crazy, it's really nice to know that people like you all exist.    EDIT: I know a lot of people hate 'thanks for the gold!!!' edits, but one of you beautiful people bought me gold when you could have bought yourself a nice latte, and you should know how much I appreciate it. You all are the best."

Motivatinggiraffe,2dz1l8,jesset77,1 point,Tue Aug 19 21:18:00 2014 UTC,"Whether you wish to accept it or not, violence is the final and the default arbiter. We choose civility by seeking alternate paths to resolve conflict, creating and then honoring arbitrary codes of ethics but only as a shortcut to avoid the unpredictable risks and harm to both sides normally consequent from violent conflict resolution.  Besides, even in the real world the weight distribution of a giraffe's hindquarters is insufficient to bring any real harm to an adult swine. ;3"

I hear how other people talk about stuff, improve it if I can, and then talk to more people. I share that with other people, and they have new ideas, and then we all go and talk to more people about stuff.  There are jobs that pay you to talk about stuff. It blows my mind."

Giraffe shouldn't be so happy throwing another thing into the box, that's what you don't want right?  Suggestion: your recent comic style panels have been great and would be great for this particular message. Panel one: close up of giraffe reading book. Panel two: giraffe finishing book and throwing it over his head. Panel three: final panel, very similar to yours, giraffe reaching into box for new book, and you see the much larger pile of already read books laying behind him.   Anyways, that's just my two cents. Love your work!   Btw: is there any way I can comission you to draw your giraffe in the classic kitty hang in there poster?"

More comic-style giraffes are definitely on the way though. They've opened up a whole new world and it's so much fun to do them.  http://imgur.com/rkqi8TK  I did this one which is pretty close to the kitty hang in there!

Motivatinggiraffe,2d9p5q,ForgotUserID,2,Tue Aug 12 06:54:39 2014 UTC,"This too shall pass also applies to the good times. I believe it's a riddle about a magic ring.  Edit:“Solomon the powerful and wealthy king chooses to test his most loyal and trusted minister, Benaiah Ben Yehoyada, by asking of him an impossible task. The king asks Benaiah to find for him a ring, knowing full well that the ring does not exist, which has magic powers. “If a happy man looks at it, he becomes sad, and if a sad man looks at it, he becomes happy,” he tells him. He expresses his desire to wear the ring for Sukkot, which is six months away. After months of searching, Benaiah finds himself, the night before Sukkot, walking through the poorest neighborhood of Jerusalem. He happens upon a jeweler, who, when asked if he’s heard of such a ring, produces from his pocket a plain gold ring, to which he adds an engravement. Benaiah returns just in time on the eve of Sukkot to give the king the ring he has requested. When the king looks at the engraving, he reads four words: “gam zeh ya’avor”, which translates to, “This too shall pass” or “This too will pass”. At that moment, Solomon realizes that his wisdom, tremendous wealth, and power are fleeting things, for one day he will be nothing but dust.”"

This time last year, I tore something in my shoulder pretty bad and had to get surgery which kept me out of the gym for about 6 months.  Come January, I had to get back into lifting from square one.  I was barely able to lift more than the bar, and it sucked!  I stuck with it though, slowly building myself back up, and now, a year later, I'm repping my bodyweight on bench, I'm deadlifting more than I was last year, and my squat is coming along nicely.  Start small, stick with it, and the results will come!"

Dropped all of my savings into moving to a different state with a boyfriend, only to be dumped a month later, without a friend in the state. Worked extra hours so I could afford a new apartment with a roommate, as well as pay off the lease I was on with my ex. New roommate turned out to be a basket case(stealing, harassing, you get the picture), and now I'm paying more than I can afford to break the lease and get yet another new place with someone I know a lot better. In the middle of this, my car broke down, making getting to  my 2 full time jobs a lot harder, with no fixing it in sight.  I stumbled here a few days ago. Suddenly, I didn't feel so overwhelmed and stressed out. I actually had a few hours of really feeling like I could do this. So I messaged her, to say thank you. I was very vague about my situation, just said I was having a run of bad luck, and how happy she made me.  And I received a reply in the morning, along with this drawing. I can't begin to say what it means to me. That a complete stranger cares enough to make my day even brighter.   Thank you again, motivatinggiraffe"

Throughout high school and this Summer, I've been rejected by 28 different girls. I've been starting to get a bit worried about my future love life. Naturally, I knew that I could turn to /u/motivatinggiraffe. I inboxed her my situation. I knew that she must get a lot messages so I didn't expect it to reach her but by the end of the day, she sent me this picture as well as a personal message. I'm not going to include everything as some of it is her personal business. But this is some of the inclusions.   ""That is a lot of rejection to deal with, and I can imagine that would leave you doubting yourself, probably quite a lot. I don't have any real advice for you - I wish I did - but I just want to tell you to not give up. The right girl is out there, and believe me when you find her, you will be so glad that the others didn't work out. Don't ever give up hope on yourself, especially in this area. It's so easy to get deterred or to think that you've got no chance. She's out there, and you'll find her. Stay strong mate :)""  What this person has decided to do with her life using nothing more than a computer and a few colored pencils is incredible and I'm going to be forever grateful that there are people out there like her!

Others I fell a little harder for. But I only ended up falling in love with one. However, I think I'm finally over her and can officially move on.

Motivatinggiraffe,2bafjq,concernedmillenial,8,Mon Jul 21 15:50:04 2014 UTC,"um, ""nasty, fucked-up"" ""lowest scum on earth"". I don't know what your definition of hateful is. That's hateful, regardless of whether it's called for or not.    Do you, or any of the people down-voting me actually realize what /u/motivatinggiraffe's is all about? She's about positively motivating, and the only thing calling them names will do is to spur them on more to commit needless hate."
Motivatinggiraffe,2bafjq,fingin,7,Mon Jul 21 16:45:33 2014 UTC,Ok.
Motivatinggiraffe,2bafjq,concernedmillenial,2,Mon Jul 21 17:15:36 2014 UTC,"For all it matters, you have my upvote. I don't think most people realizing that saying how nasty others are show that they themselves can have just as nasty of an attitude. The whole point is to have love and kindness for each other, not talk about how ""scum"" someone is, regardless of if they spew hatred or not.  Be the better person and show them how to be caring and kind, even if they may not deserve it to you."
Motivatinggiraffe,2bafjq,StephanieBeavs,5,Wed Jul 23 12:06:41 2014 UTC,Saying people are nasty does not make you nasty. Those Nazi's. Awful lads. Am I hateful? No.

Motivatinggiraffe,2bafjq,eggbert194,25,Wed Sep 17 20:55:27 2014 UTC,Hey there -  Sorry to hear about this! Your pictures are definitely appreciated (and adorable!) and it's sad that some people feel the need to go out of their way to insult what you do. Don't feel the need to censor yourself just because trolls are getting sick satisfaction from putting you down. If anyone is desperate and pathetic in this situation it is certainly not you. Keep on keeping on! :)

The vast, vast majority of people love your work. You're going outside of the norm, so of course a handful of bitter people are going to try to stop you - but there is absolutely no reason for you to listen to them."
Motivatinggiraffe,2bafjq,LogicDragon,17,Mon Jul 21 12:39:52 2014 UTC,"I subcribe to this sub so obviously I'm a fan of the giraffes. For me they're not motivating because of the messages (though they're good too) but because they're personal and not just a random ""Just do it"" slapped on a nice picture of a sunset.   You responded directly to someone's comment and made a picture specifically for this one person and this one situation. Someone didn't just say ""Oh, I care about you, random redditor that I've never met"" but really cared enough to draw a giraffe and that is why you're awesome and motivate me when I'm having a bad day.  Also, desperate is great. We're (hopefully) all over the ""Too cool to care""-phase and  desperate means that you're driven and have something that motivates you."

Even if your giraffes can't stop planes from falling or rockets from blowing up, they can brighten peoples days, and motivate them to do the best they can, and that's more than a lot of people, including me, can say about what they do."

You get hate mail and you don't even get mad at the person who sent it. A lot of people like all of your giraffes. You may not realize it, but you've probably helped a lot of people, too. Please ignore the hate and embrace the affection."

Motivatinggiraffe,2bafjq,pastrypalace,11,Mon Jul 21 14:30:52 2014 UTC,I only recently discovered you and this sub.  It's sad to hear that you're getting hate mail.  I think your giraffes are wonderful and I hope you can ignore them and keep up the good work.
Motivatinggiraffe,2bafjq,juef,10,Mon Jul 21 14:27:49 2014 UTC,"I'm glad you concluded that it's worth it, because I definitely agree! :)  But think of yourself, too: even if ""it's worth it"", the hate mail can take a toll on one's happiness and mental health. It's easy to say ""just ignore it"", but I'm certain it's not that simple...  Anyway, thanks for the love & the giraffes! :)"
Motivatinggiraffe,2bafjq,FFVIINanaki,9,Mon Jul 21 13:53:48 2014 UTC,"When I was younger, and still today even, I was upset at the idea that somewhere in the world, someone hated me(or would if they knew me) for who I am. I want everyone to like me, or to at least see some value in me, I like to be helpful and genuinely appreciated.  It took a leap of courage for me to understand and acknowledge that you can't be liked by everyone, but that you CAN try to help everyone. I'm fortunate enough to be appreciated by most of the people I do help, but I reached a milestone in combating my own insecurities when I learned to live with being disliked by some."

It seems pretty ridiculous that they would try to censor this beautiful technology because of the potential threat of terrorism, when tens of thousands of lives would be saved each year from driving related incidents.   The same goes with your drawings. You are amazing and you bring joy to so many people (including me) on this website. Who cares what a select few are thinking. There are a tonne of people on here who look forward to seeing your awesome drawings and you should definitely never slow down or filter yourself!   Keep it up giraffe :)"

Motivatinggiraffe,2bafjq,moredrugsmore3somes,8,Mon Jul 21 15:11:17 2014 UTC,I was on acid last night and saw your pictures and couldn't stop smiling the whole night because of them. Never stop Mr. Motivating giraffe! You brighten all my days!
Motivatinggiraffe,2bafjq,vicklawl,8,Mon Jul 21 15:18:47 2014 UTC,"Hey,    All these guys have made it very clear to you what they think. Of course, I agree with them. You know what I just went through? One of your giraffes could have changed it. Seriously. Never, never, ever underestimate the power of a friendly word. Words are power, obviously, or these negative comments wouldn't have gotten to you. But shadows move aside for light, and even if they'll always be there, they have to hide and cower as befits them. There will always be those who seem to bater their self-worth by giving yours a hit. But you know what you do. For every person who dislikes your work, there are literally hundreds, probably thousands you've made smile. And smiles can change everything. I can't and won't tell you what to do, but my suggestion is to keep on going, for as long as you want to. You people, you really do matter. You're not just some novelty account; you're a real person who takes time out of her days to brighten others'. And if hate ever gets to you, do what you're doing now. Come here, or anywhere, really, for reassurance. You will surely find it. And this has gone on for too long. But yeah, hopefully, we've made it clear: We love what you do. You drive us to make a change like you. Your ripple effect could continue for ages. And if you feel you have to stop, for whatever reason, do so immediately. Don't do this because you have to, only and always when you want to. You have enough people behind you who will continue your work. Have a great day, MG. :)    -Ego"

On a more serious note, don't let the haters get to you. What you've done was bring cheer and smiles to everyone. The reason I subscribed to your subreddit was to be reminded everyday that people can still be happy in this miserable world. Thank you for your hard work, motivation and ebullience."

My advice is to take your own advice and don't give up. The hate mail you're receiving could very well be the work of just one or two people who are jealous of the love in your heart. Compare that to the 20+ people who've already left comments in here expressing gratitude and support, and the countless others whose days you've brightened and to whom you've given hope, many of which are probably just lurkers who left their computers with determination to be a better, happier person. All thanks to you and your awesome giraffes."
Motivatinggiraffe,2bafjq,parkerfly,6,Mon Jul 21 15:47:44 2014 UTC,It'd be awesome if everyone on Reddit who has appreciated your giraffes teamed up and made you a giant motivating giraffe picture to show our appreciation!  It sucks you've gotten some hate mail for doing such a kind thing :\

Motivatinggiraffe,2bafjq,mand71,6,Mon Jul 21 16:11:26 2014 UTC,"It's unfortunate that the negative comments stand out more than the positive ones.  Thank you so much for doing what you do.  I'm having a tough day riding the struggle bus at work today after drinking too much yesterday and getting in a big fight w my boyfriend yesterday so believe me, your giraffes are helping a lot today.  That's just my story, I'm sure you're helping a lot of people with their own reasons to need motivation."

She does it to a fair amount of people just to be nice."" Their reaction? ""That's the most cutest, nicest thing ever. Holy shit."" I showed her a lot of pictures and she loved them.  The ones who hate? Ignore them, if you see the message delete it. Keep it out of mind.

I think a significant number of the negative messagers are mentally ill.  Having said that there's no doubt some others just take pleasure in trying to hurt people - to my mind they're ill as well but they'd no doubt argue differently.  And some of them, well they're just immature young men (primarily) whose adolescent brain has yet to develop empathy. Sadly, some of them should be well past that stage, but maybe there's still hope for them yet.  Carry on spreading the love - there's far more of us than them!"

Motivatinggiraffe,2ar9zz,Braerian,4,Tue Jul 15 21:19:37 2014 UTC,So you're saying it would be just as bad if a male rollerskating giraffe picked a human woman up as it is if a female rollerskating giraffe picked up a male?   I just want to make sure I understand you right.
Motivatinggiraffe,2apffw,motivatinggiraffe,8,Mon Jul 14 21:54:52 2014 UTC,Because sometimes you just need a row of dancing giraffes to make you realise that you're doing okay.

Motivatinggiraffe,2abcnq,Boolean263,16,Thu Jul 10 07:38:27 2014 UTC,"You know, everyone is going through something, even those that look the happiest. Ultimately I believe it's what we do that defines us, especially when we're facing hard times. The impact we leave in the world, the little things. In that regard, you're most definitively winning. Hang in there!.   You may not have realized it yet, but in addition to directly motivate people and putting smiles on their faces, you're also giving others the chance to do the same. Personally I love showing your drawings to friends having a hard time. No one expects a motivating giraffe on a random link, but it's always a guaranteed smile.   You're a wonderful person, thank you for being so awesome! :)"

I'm not quite sure what the point of this is either, but I just want to thank you for brightening my days when I see your giraffes. And let you know that you're not alone, and you are appreciated."

No matter how bad it gets, everyone gets that light at the end of the tunnel. Never give up hope, because no matter how bad anything seems, your existence is putting a smile on someone's face out there. Even though you don't know it yet. Think of the soul mate you'll meet one day and smile. Somewhere, someone has done that, and you're the person on the receiving end of that. You are light to myself and my best friend, as I've said before, and if you ever need a chat, please, PLEASE pm me. I'd be honoured to know the girl behind the giraffe, because she seems amazing. I'm Kyle, and you bring a little hope to my cynical mind every day. You remind me that amazing people exist and that there are beings of pure light. Stay strong. You'll get through this."

Make it a habit.  You're doing that with your giraffes and I hope it's working for you.  I know I look at them when I'm feeling down and need a pick me up.  If you ever need a chat, myself and I'm sure many other redditors are always here for you.  You're doing a great thing while fighting your own demons.

As easy as the breakup was, it has not been easy on me at all. I know breakups are petty compared to what many other people have to go through, but its killing me inside. I miss her, I love her so much.   Sometimes I like to think that your giraffes saved my life. I discovered a giraffe of yours yesterday, within an hour of the breakup, and eventually made my way to this sub. Instantly, any and all crazy thoughts I may have had were gone.   Thank you, Giraffe.

Motivatinggiraffe,2a072q,motivatinggiraffe,10,Sun Jul 6 23:48:10 2014 UTC,today I learned that giraffes don't actually have spots on their underbelly. whoops!
Motivatinggiraffe,2a072q,VioletCrow,6,Sun Jul 6 23:48:39 2014 UTC,But motivating giraffes totally do :D!
Motivatinggiraffe,2a072q,Nicksaurus,3,Mon Jul 7 04:57:22 2014 UTC,"Yeah, well..."
Motivatinggiraffe,2a072q,jesterfraud,2,Mon Jul 7 14:52:43 2014 UTC,I prefer to think you're drawing a long forgotten relative of the common giraffe that does. :)

Motivatinggiraffe,29xaav,TheDarkerThings,3,Sat Jul 5 22:01:36 2014 UTC,California is having one of the worst droughts I've ever seen here. I wish we had some rain
Motivatinggiraffe,29xaav,HoodieMack,0,Sun Jul 6 08:17:17 2014 UTC,"I held the opposite position when living in SoCal, as I was literally living in a tent on the sidewalk. Rainy days were the worst, super mood-killer.  I'm working in Alaska for now, and even now, the rain makes for less pleasurable days...but at least I can sleep while it rains =)"
Motivatinggiraffe,29xaav,ydnab2,2,Mon Jul 14 08:15:14 2014 UTC,"Growing up I was told rain is just liquid sunshine. We're happy about the sun being out, so why not the rain?  Although with context, this was made up by my dad so we wouldn't cry about getting wet between restaurant and car runs. Still works the same either way..."
Motivatinggiraffe,29xaav,Zulgrath,2,Sat Jul 5 23:04:29 2014 UTC,I love the rain. Just watching it. Also thunderstorms. I like the smell.
Motivatinggiraffe,29xaav,JustAHiccup,2,Sun Jul 6 00:01:42 2014 UTC,Every time it rains it rains  Pennies from heaven.  Don't you know each cloud contains  Pennies from heaven.  You'll find your fortune falling  All over town.  Be sure that your umbrella is upside down!
Motivatinggiraffe,29vhzq,motivatinggiraffe,37,Sat Jul 5 03:25:39 2014 UTC,"hey all, i'm back after a week away from the real world and my giraffes - sometimes taking a break is just what you need! i still have the next three weeks off before classes start again so hopefully you'll see a bit of me around reddit.  i also bought a fancy pancy scanner this morning, and i'm slowly scanning the high quality versions of most of my pics. if you'd like me to send you a copy of any, just send me a message :) the versions i upload to imgur are usually quite small since i try to keep the file size down.  also, this might be a long shot but a couple of months ago someone sent me a message about the original hourglass picture and i was going to post it to you, i now am able to but i've lost where i wrote down your username and address! if you happen to be reading this please just shoot me another message, sorry i've been so slack!  hope you've had a fantastic week and happy 4th of july to all US redditors, party hard but party safely :)"

Obviously pass, waiting for my training date, have a scan on my hip and it turns out they're fucked up. Have to leave the police which I spent 5 years progressing to. That's not me controlling it, that was chance my genes went that way. Simply put as I said - you can minimise your chances, but they play a large element in your life.  I'm on another career path a year later, but that's down to my self-determination to be the best I can be. All you can do is try and hope it works out."

Motivatinggiraffe,27v94n,motivatinggiraffe,9,Wed Jun 11 11:12:14 2014 UTC,I think you have no idea how much your drawings mean for some people. They helped me through some tough times. You are an amazing person. Thank you.

Motivatinggiraffe,275mgo,singlemanblues,7,Tue Jun 3 23:31:01 2014 UTC,"It's OK, buddy. At least you had the courage to ask her out. If, in the end, she doesn't agree, then look for another girl who will. :)"
Motivatinggiraffe,275mgo,JangoBunBun,10,Wed Jun 4 03:44:46 2014 UTC,Eh. I'm happy being single. I don't have to share my netflix.
Motivatinggiraffe,275mgo,JangoBunBun,8,Wed Jun 4 03:50:25 2014 UTC,I will. G'night

Motivatinggiraffe,275mgo,CumChowder,8,Tue Jun 3 09:58:28 2014 UTC,I knew it was only a matter of time before you made this.
Motivatinggiraffe,275mgo,singlemanblues,8,Mon Jun 2 23:37:03 2014 UTC,"I'll do it. But first, I need to see if she has a ring on her right ring finger. :)    Edit: She may look older than I am, but she is very beautiful.    Edit 2 (June 5, 2014): I got her name, and she doesn't have a ring. She seems uninterested, though. But it's all good.    Edit 3 (June 6, 2014): I had a short conversation with her on our way out of the building our offices are in. I found out that she is a hardworking woman. Definitely turned on.  Edit 4 (June 9, 2014): Saw her wearing a cocktail dress. Was left speechless. Felt she deserved a lovely origami flower, so I asked the receptionist in our office for paper. Good thing she had soft cartolina, a great substitute for origami paper. Spent 20 minutes making origami flower and gave it to her afterwards. She laughed at the thought of being given one.    Edit 5 (June 11, 2014): I did not see her today. It's a holiday tomorrow (Independence Day) but I'll be working. On Friday, I won't. It's gonna be a long weekend for me. I won't be seeing her in a few days. I'll use the time to improve myself more. Give her another figure or some chocolate, maybe?     Edit 6 (June 15, 2014): I downloaded a dating app out of a whim. Signed up and explored profiles. Most are students and potential crazy cat ladies. Had a bit of fun while I was at it. I definitely miss her.    Edit 7 (June 16, 2014): Saw her today, looking as amazing as always. Said hi, but I don't want to think too much about her for now. My life needs a ton of fixing, and only I can do that.    Edit 8 (June 18, 2014): I realized that relationships aren't my priority now. I guess I should just chill and enjoy singlehood rather than hurry.    Edit 9 (June 20, 2014): I tired asking her out, she said no, and now I'm quite pissed. I'll acknowledge this feeling, chill the fuck out, and probably do something I enjoy. For now, I'll rant."
Motivatinggiraffe,275mgo,Riipa,8,Tue Jun 3 05:34:35 2014 UTC,As someone who recently did something like this and miserably failed: Go for it by any means! There is nothing to lose - nothing but your fear of rejection that is.
Motivatinggiraffe,275mgo,Erisianistic,3,Tue Jun 3 16:11:16 2014 UTC,"Good luck, everybody! I found mine, out of the blue, on a dating website I'd pretty much given up on. So never stop trying!"

I don't want to put a lot of pressure on you but every new post, drawing and saying is a little encouraging especially at this point of my shit life and it just happened to be this one post that I started to tear up a lot cry.  Well, like what they say about baths, motivation is recommended daily and you were apart of my daily motivation today.  Thanks =)  (not that I'm asking you to do it daily.  It's just my daily round of finding something to keep me going)."

Motivatinggiraffe,26fbj2,AlwaysTheBigSpoon,5,Sun May 25 09:16:49 2014 UTC,"As tempting as it is to see all of them, for me, I'd do a ""keep them wanting more"" and you've got a backlog to post so you're set for a while and don't have to be stressed when you just have one of those days of running out of ideas.  I'm also a little bias because giraffes are my number one favourite animals.  And it does get a little heartbreaking when I see ""stupid long horses."" haha.  Thanks again =)"
