Best thing for it is google(got all of them right for me) a periodic table that's labelled, and a calculator.

Plus if you were to ask, say ""what's the party life like"" or something of that nature, it could make the tour guide uncomfortable since parents usually accompany their kids during the tour.

Um, after the tour there is a housing tour. So go to that if you're interested in living on-campus. If not, don't fret, there are tons of student exclusive housing off campus.  I was in your shoes sometime back, now I'm accepted and heading to UCF as a transfer this Fall."

Google, Microsoft and tons of other tech companies have recruited here and even hold seminars sometimes. Orlando has Lockheed and Disney recruiting for interns as well.  Since I'm in the mood, I'll tell you a bit more about UCF, we have 60,000 students and there is so much to do on and off campus. We have hundreds of clubs and organizations and such so you won't ever feel you can't make friends.  I want to say more but I don't want to spoil your tour tomorrow :)  If you have any questions you aren't comfortable asking on the tour, I don't mind answering.  Um, also what I said about the off campus housing, I failed to mention the 12-13? I forget. Apartment communities off campus offer a free shuttle that runs every 15-20 mins from like 7 am -10 pm to UCF. So if you can't get a dorm there are other options"
ucf,3dw89q,mmelli,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:45:30 2015 UTC,I'm really hoping to dorm since it's supposed to be good for meeting people and because I'm really looking forward to the whole college experience so hopefully that works out.

I ""dressed to impress"" or at least I did in my neurotic mind. I was boiling alive. I was a tense sweating mess of anxiety.   Remember to relax. You'll learn more from the guides if you can have honest informal dialogues. Just stay laid back and learn a lot. Nobody is paying attention to the tour groups like I thought they were so don't feel self conscious. Once I got settled into my major I realized the insane amount of transfers that surrounded me - I felt wildly insecure for no reason.   Dress light, be relaxed, and try to enjoy it!"

ucf,3dw89q,Shadowex3,2,Mon Jul 20 02:26:32 2015 UTC,"I'm sure it's different for everyone. The folks I surrounded myself with were such a big mix. Lots that couldn't afford 4 years of a university like me that had an AA some that came from other schools too.   I just felt so insecure at first! Constantly getting lost, perpetually sweating, and knowing so few people - I really faked it till I made it. Which helped at first because it really drove me academically for a while which was good long run.   I knew a few people that transferred in spring. I transferred in summer. It's such a mix. UCF is so involved in the direct connect program and SSC/Valencia are growing so fast it didn't feel like it at first but there are many many transfers around you.   You'll be so fine man!"

You can see the requirements for getting into the College of Business here, under ""Pre-Major"": https://business.ucf.edu/degree/bachelors-sciences-business-administration/economics/  It doesn't appear to be competitive in the sense that there are limited spots (like in Ad/PR or Journalism) or audition/interviews (like Music/Theatre), but you need to meet all the requirements listed there in order to apply to the Economics major."

It's mostly families though so there's isn't many parties and its really quiet. But that also means your neighbors are more likely to lodge a complaint for noise or call the cops, we've got college students across the building from us and they've already been reported for being loud at night like 10 times. Someone even called animal services on them because they let their dog out without a leash. The traffic on Woodbury is bad enough to make you want to move out.   Its mad expensive but if you can swing it, its great for feeling like a bonafied adult.   The office is pretty cool, but there's a ton of turnover with employees so you've got to be on top of your paperwork or you could get in trouble. The gym is shit and there aren't many community events. Maintenance isn't that bad, if you make friends with them then they'll go the extra mile.

ucf,3dkj0s,throwawayFCU,6,Fri Jul 17 00:33:48 2015 UTC,"When I lived at Knights Circle they messed up a few people's placement.  My roommate assignment changed a few times before I got my official roommates.  To be totally honest with you, unless the management has changed since I lived there 2 years ago these sorts of ""mess ups"" are bound to happen a few times while you live there.  The management there kind of sucks. However, I bet you could get your roommate placement fixed if you call and ask to speak with the supervisor/manager about your issue.  They tend to try to make their new residents happy so they'll probably try to rectify this issue."

ucf,3dkj0s,dumbassniggashit,4,Fri Jul 17 02:44:13 2015 UTC,"When doing placements, the number one preference they look at should be who you requested as roommates. That being said, depending on when you signed with them, it might just be impossible to do because, again typically, placements are done on a first come, first served basis.   The reason why people don't get their official roommates until a few times of switching around is because of people who are unhappy with their placement being switched around (maybe they didn't get roomed with their roommate, maybe they don't like living on the first floor, etc.)  Cancelations may happen, but it's honestly case by case and depending on the managers. If you signed months ago (like, before April), then they might be inclined to do this since it should've been early enough that they'd accommodate that for you. If you signed right before they got full? Less likely, since people in that industry have very little sympathy for late signers who have placement complaints (although some do take roommate requests very seriously.)  Everyone should keep in mind that this property is HUGE (2000+ bedrooms). I've worked in places that aren't even a quarter of that and we had the phones ringing off the hook simply because everyone just can't live on the upper floors by the pool. Showing a little empathy and patience can go a LONG way. If you yell at me for 20 minutes because you got the first floor AND you completed paperwork last week, I will be less inclined to do the work for you since these are, at the end of the day, preferences.   End note for everyone: please, if you got placed where you wanted and are happy with the treatment you've gotten from your housing office so far, show us! We are now working 12-14 hour days for you and we hear so much negativity and vitriol from people that getting a simple thank you can absolutely get us through the rest of the day. There's a lot of work that goes into getting hundreds of rooms ready and placed in such a short time span so you guys can have an amazing year at college without having to worry about coming home. At the end of the day, we're working for you. We do not get any pleasure or benefits out of making you angry.  TL;DR: Be upset but be understanding and patient. They might find room for you, and if not, they will likely let you out of the lease free and clear."
ucf,3dkj0s,NotARacecar,2,Fri Jul 17 13:22:34 2015 UTC,"This is a pretty great response. If my 3 friends had a room since last year, and they preferred me and I preferred them, how likely is it that I could get placed with them? Is there a way to expedite the process by getting in contact with their 4th random roommate and getting switched? Thank you"
ucf,3dkj0s,dumbassniggashit,2,Fri Jul 17 17:10:22 2015 UTC,"Well, it really depends, /u/dumbassniggashit . If the complex is full and they can't find you a spot at all, there's likely 0 chance.   If they still have some availability, then you have some wiggle room. At that point, it's a matter of what preferences the random roommate had. For example, let's say your friends live on the top floor and have a premium room in their apartment. Now let's say the random person was placed in the premium room. If he specifically requested to live on the top floor in a premium room, it's likely that the leasing office won't budge. If he didn't make any of those requests, then it might be a simple move. At this point, it's up to the managers whether to either move them themselves, or to let you have their contact information to ask if they would be willing to switch rooms.  I just want to be clear that I can only speak from my personal experience. You might have some places that don't want to bother with it because they have so much more on their plate to deal with or you might have some where it's just not in their policy to switch placements once everybody has been told where they're going to live.   In short, it's always worth asking, but it really comes down to how you ask and where you're asking.   EDIT: Formatting"

Literally what they were doing was slapping on new coats of paint and upgrading the apartments and shifting all the existing tenants multiple times so we never got any of the upgrades.

Is that something I can talk to the advisors during orientation? I'd like to go for that option if I can. Especially if I can avoid tech travesties like this.

ucf,3ddlk1,birdman7260,3,Wed Jul 15 13:41:32 2015 UTC,"You should check out the rock climbing club. It's one of the cheapest, not competitive (much more social, though the club does sponsor a ""team"" should you get inclined later on), takes a trip to some outdoor climbing area once a semester, and might be the easiest way to meet a lot of great people quickly. Plus, pretty much everyone starts climbing for the first time when they join so you won't feel out of place in terms of ability either."

Most of my friends aren't in college, not in UCF, or still trying to transfer over. My classes for the past two semesters have mostly been online so it's been a little tough making friends on campus and I checked out the clubs too but most of them didn't fit in with my class/work schedule as I live about an hour away from campus. This semester is going to be little better arranged schedule wise and most of my classes are on campus. When the semester starts, I will be going to the gym about three times a day (MWF). I wanted to start getting into lifting (instead of just cardio) as well but it's tough trying something new and not having a buddy. Send me a PM, if you're interested."

ucf,3demng,MickCollins,14,Wed Jul 15 20:16:02 2015 UTC,"Large public college campuses - I'd say over 10k in students - you get to a point where there's everyone. All races are represented, all religions are represented, all orientations are represented, etc. Depending on geography, some will be more or less represented (i.e. more people of the Jewish faith at colleges around urban centers for instance).   At private schools it's a bit different. Take for instance Notre Dame - it's a Catholic school. Likely a much lower variation for non-Catholics going there than Catholics, and as such ties into racial representation as well (there are not many Black or Asian Catholics).  UCF has the second largest student body in the entire country. Mind you, some of them are commuters, and from remote campuses - but some of those students still participate in student organizations.  You will be able to find likeminded people at UCF, no matter whether you're Democrat, Republican, Independent, Gay, Straight, Trans, Catholic, Hindu, Muslim, Baptist....the list goes on and on and on. It's just that at UCF you'll see higher numbers of people in those kind of student organizations because of the student class size. These organizations (usually) receive money from the university to support their functions, because having a club for X, Y or Z makes the school look better - and able to recruit more students."

If they set up an in person interview, email and ask about doing a phone interview at the same time since you're not in town. Most managers (any you'll want to work for) will be reasonable. The topic of transportation will probably come up, if you're certain you will have a car then say that you can start on X date and you can guarantee you'll be able to get there then but not before.

In order to get readmitted, you are required to obtain your AA degree from a community college. I finished mine up at Valencia while I was disqualified. You should be fine to try for readmission for Spring 2016, but readmission is not guaranteed even if you met all the requirements. I'm on my third attempt for readmission, so if you do not get readmitted make sure you have a back-up plan. I enrolled in a Bachelor's degree program at Seminole State and took classes I needed for my degree at UCF and I think it helped me a lot in the readmission process.

ucf,3d1qi3,UCFrogerz,6,Sun Jul 12 22:55:44 2015 UTC,Yep.  I lived in Tivoli back from 2004-2008.  Not really sure what information I can provide besides it burned a huge part of the building and the rest was ruined by water.  Tons of fire trucks and emergency personal.  Kinda strange how it's happened again and is so equally devastating.
ucf,3d1qi3,generalCopper,4,Sun Jul 12 23:38:38 2015 UTC,"I just started living at Tivoli in January and this is kind of concerning. Like, the infrastructure of the apartments here has been kind of questionable to me--I see water damage all the time on the ceilings, etc, and I'm on the first floor. I don't have a terrible experience with Tivoli and I extended my lease, but some things are a little too shoddy.  I should probably look into renter's insurance."

ucf,3d1qi3,AbandonedGoat,5,Mon Jul 13 00:40:53 2015 UTC,"This is kind of why I would honestly feel a little better knowing it was some dumbass with fireworks than something like a faulty electrical outlet or anything directly tied to the apartment itself.

ucf,3d1qi3,24caratcake,3,Mon Jul 13 00:45:11 2015 UTC,"That's more what I mean. I already lost one house to a fire, and it burned way slower because it was meant to withstand a fire (and it was still standing at the end). These buildings obviously are not built in that way.

Finally, you're talking about Summer or Fall session 2015?  I highly recommend visiting UCF's Financial Aid page, and the federal government's website on FAFSA. You need to completely read this information because FAFSA is much broader than sign up and get money, it has too many stipulations and requirements to list.  Please read ""Apply for Aid"", "" Receiving Aid"", ""Types of Aid"" and ""General Info"" and their subcategories found here on UCF's website. http://finaid.ucf.edu/  Read the information found on the government's website also. https://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/  As for how you will receive your grants and loans, it will pay for those things automatically when the college begins processing tuition and fees for the term. If you have money left over it will be disbursed to you via the direct deposit account on your student account. If you owe the college money after grants and loans you have to pay that."
ucf,3czu8z,ajs1850,5,Sun Jul 12 07:37:46 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I don't think it matters in the long run.  UCF has a pretty strong CS department if I'm not mistaken but I'm not sure how closely related the two are."
ucf,3czu8z,UCF_Chris,3,Sun Jul 12 09:44:05 2015 UTC,I would echo this. ucf cs is quite difficult but I think graduates do really well. I think the other degrees are fairly normal
ucf,3czu8z,DrDeezNuttz,3,Sun Jul 12 14:01:55 2015 UTC,"I have a friend who is in IT at UCF. He has enjoyed it and it doesn't seem too bad. UCF doesn't require as many online classes (I think) than USF, AND in my opinion real classes are much better anyway.

UCF all of the way"

ucf,3czu8z,Oen386,2,Sun Jul 12 19:40:32 2015 UTC,Yes most of the classes do and at the end they will tell you what certifications that you can try to get and they will help point you in the right direction.
ucf,3czu8z,zinnenator,2,Sun Jul 12 21:00:11 2015 UTC,"Do they prep you for certifications and stuff like that?   Just FYI. In my experience, unless a job you wants (or encourages) you to have a certain certificate, they can end up being a waste of money.  They do show you know the terminology, and at one point you could answer test questions about the subject. Internships, projects, or other hands on experience always seems to out weigh them, as you have practical working knowledge rather than something from a book.  Mostly certificates get your foot in the door if you don't have any related work experience in a field you would like to enter. They also don't always guarantee a raise or higher pay.  As was answered though, more courses are being reconfigured to help you pass related certifications."
ucf,3czu8z,fozziefreakingbear,2,Mon Jul 13 20:28:07 2015 UTC,I just know as far as certain certs go in IT some certs are worth a lot of money! How do you like the Nursing program by the way? I originally wanted to go into nursing haha.

ucf,3cvn53,DrPapiChulo,3,Sat Jul 11 06:26:19 2015 UTC,Usually half the semester is taught by one and the other is taught by the second. It's common with courses where one professor is conducting research and has to leave midway. Just check to make sure they're both the same difficulty level. I had Klowden/McSomething or other and the first half was literally hell on earth and the second half was like middle school biology.
ucf,3cvn53,kmh0394,2,Sat Jul 11 14:23:12 2015 UTC,Hey there Lexi! This can be for a couple of reasons depending on the class you're taking. One reason can be a dual-teach method. Both show up to class everyday and both lecture over the given topic. Another reason I know of is as /u/zlaqh said one teaches for the first half/another teaches the second half. Hope this helps!
ucf,3cvn53,UCFKnight2019,2,Sat Jul 11 05:42:05 2015 UTC,"It is also possible that one of the names is the professor who is teaching the class and the other is a TA assigned to that class.  I TAed for a class last year that had two TAs, so it listed three names."

I'm not telling you these things to gloat... Im telling you because I was fearful of my grade in the class. I was happy I left with a B. It shouldn't be that way. I knew the material before going in.   I would wait another semester.   Quick edit to expand a bit: I would get tests backback with the same answers as other students... However some students would have their answers marked wrong. Mine would have partial credit.other people got 0 points. She would answer peoples questions with ramblings and then ask them their own question back and say ""what do you think"". I would debate test questions marked off and normally she would dismiss anything you say and not reconsider grading,even if someone else was marked write for a similar answer."

ucf,3ct420,moe-money,2,Fri Jul 10 19:14:29 2015 UTC,"Noooo don't do it! I went through that nightmare last year. Besides being a terrible professor (bad at explaining concepts, wouldn't provide explanation other than ""that's the only right way to do it"", etc)...  She made comments various times that were inappropriate for the classroom (religious/political based). She wouldn't answer questions directly and would just repeat the same ""well, that's how you do it"". On every test, students would have questions about the wording of a problem and were generally confused about what she was asking. We would ask for clarification and she would insist that she couldn't ""help you on the test"". When graded tests were passed back, there were Ds/Fs all around and when we'd ask why we were marked off and explain the reasoning behind our answers, she'd say that we ""had the wrong interpretation"". She scheduled mandatory group presentations for our final projects AFTER the last day of classes - the only alternative given after talking with the CS department was a video option, which had to be completed and turned in over Thanksgiving break. She clearly treated some students in the class VERY different - towards mid/end of the semester, she had stopped answering questions from some people altogether, or giving them complete attitude and shutting them down when they asked a question. The semester ended with her filing a complain against one of her students (a close friend of mine) and making sure she had ""evidence"" (conveniently from her TAs, who were also good for nothing) to back her up, even though I was there during the ""incident"" and everything she had reported to the dean was absolute BS.  In the end, 30+ people from our DB class talked to the dean, who then said we were sexist and did nothing about the terrible learning environment."

I forget who you have to talk to to get registered while at Valenica but start by contacting g Barbara Kelly-Hursey. Google her info for her email. I would but I am driving. I know it happened relatively frequently, as at least one past drum major I know started while she was at Valenica.  You don't get paid at UCF. However, I wouldn't trade in my time spent there for ANYTHING. I ended up rushing the band sorority and have made a ton of life long friends. I know the percussion section has a special bond too. We don't have a pit but if your audition doesn't go well I think you end up on cymbals for a season.   Overall I think doing MKs was what kept me sane while at UCF. You end up immediately having 300 new best friends after band camp. Please let me know if you have any other questions.  :)  Edit: also, even if you have missed the deadline, if you want to march this year try anyway. I had a friend who joined the week after band camp. You may not have a spot right away or in the first show, or you might be an alternate in the pregame. But its worth a try!!"
ucf,3crz8w,pprbckwrtr,3,Fri Jul 10 11:55:36 2015 UTC,"Second all of that! I've never marched MK, but I'm a percussion major with alot of friends who have and its worth your time.   As far as this trying to get a spot this year, they're pretty locked in as far as space goes so of they picked you up, it would probably be for cymbals. For the future I would say snare is probably the most sought after spot but attainable depending on how few Infinity/I2 wgi guys are in the pool."

Soooooo many lifelong friends made and I am actually going to marry someone I met in MKs soon. On a professional level, I learned so much about the ins and outs of the University through my involvement, including how to professionally interact with professors in the music department. Those skills have transferred really well to graduate school and my PhD program.  It's not a paying gig, but when you travel all expenses are covered and you receive a daily stipend for food. Chances are good for marching if you are at Valencia. The band is always looking to boost numbers. DO IT! You really wont regret it.  Edit: Also, the only other expenses I can remember outside of the 1 credit hour, were the cost of black marching shoes if you don't have any (Roughly $20-$30) and rental of an instrument if you need (I think around $50 for the semester)."

Make sure you understand EVERYTHING, do the review assignments on MyMathLab until you feel comfortable and go to the review session he'll host the Saturday or Sunday before the exam week.

If you fail at UCF, you might do better taking the class transient at Valencia. There are other options.  But that's getting ahead of ourselves.

ucf,3cq0m8,Chawk121,1 point,Fri Jul 10 00:39:36 2015 UTC,Statistics classes at Ucf are much better than college algebra because they don't require you to do the 3 weekly mall hours and the professors actually teach.

Bring a pillow and blanket, maybe two or a sleeping bag because the beds in the dorms are just plastic mattresses. And maybe some entertainment if you dont want talk to other dorm people.  I don't think there was a set curfew to be back. The dorm rooms are two to each with a bathroom connecting two dorm rooms. You may or may not have a roommate for the overnight orientation, I didnt.

UCF also uses enterprise wifi which a lot of consumer devices can't access, so I'd hook my laptop up to the ethernet and use connectify to connect my xbox and chromecast. I never kept the network on for longer than a couple of hours though. Also, broadcasting your own wifi network isn't allowed, but with that being said, I never received any warnings or anything. I even noticed that there was a ""peer"" network in the building. I'm not suggesting you break the rules though.  As far as torrenting, I never tried to torrent at school and personally, I'm against it (film major), but your teamviewer/dropbox idea could work, and it's free. But if you wanted to try something a little less cumbersome you could try a service like bitport where you just download your torrents to the cloud and watch them online.

ucf,3ci2zg,Cynical-C,2,Wed Jul 8 02:41:28 2015 UTC,"The networking part is great. Classes aren't typically a great way to meet a lot of people, you go for lecture then after you're off to your next class,  job, or studying. I would say if you want to meet people it is great.  Know that almost every fraternity has drama. When rushing a frat really one wrong move could get you kicked out (or not extended a bid). (See /u/Cynical-C 's comment.) I've seen people not offered a chance to join a fraternity after completing their initiation semester simply because another initiate wasn't invited in. Kind of ""if my friend can't get in, you're friend can't either"". Lots of bullshit...  Consider the size, if the group is smaller you'll get to know everyone. If they're larger, they will likely have cliques, but you will have a chance at more networking/connections.  Also look at the time commitment. Most frats have required events or meetings. If you're taking a lot of courses it sucks having to take a night off from studying during midterms because there is some emergency meeting with the frat because someone is mad about what was said on Facebook (this happened). As long as you know how many events and meetings you have to attend you'll be fine.  Whether you end up staying in the frat or not, just getting to meet more people on campus is great. I've known plenty of people that were in a frat for only a semester or two, but still became great friends with some of the members and remained friends after they left.  tl;dr Join a frat. Worth it for the life experience, even if it sucks at times."

ucf,3ch7sg,xsqr,6,Tue Jul 7 21:57:15 2015 UTC,"I'm a second degree seeking international student in my senior year at UCF. In my country, I did something unrelated to CS, and here I had the opportunity to go to school again.  First I wanted that degree because my math (which was more difficult) was not accepted from my country. However, I was not able to get it because we (F1 students) are not allowed to get online degrees.  Having said that here is my opinion,  If you want to go in the Software Engineering route. I think is perfectly fine getting that degree. However, you have two cons against you:  1) The degree is not nationally accredited because it is very new.  Of course, this is something that you could work on by doing some side projects to improve the fact that you have a strange degree in your resume.  However, as a matter of fact, two years ago when I was not a CS major, I went to one of the UCF job fairs and I wrote on my name tag that I was a BAS major (I did not know about the online limitation at that moment). To my surprise, one of the guys representing one of the companies asked, ""what is that? Do you really know how to program?""  People are biased with that degree. You'll have to work double to get the job that you want.  2) In my case, it was a very reasonable choice. However, do you really want to waste the social opportunity and the unique time of life that means going to college? That does not come again my friend. Of course, as I said, my case is different.  These are the only two cons that I see, if you are going in the Software Engineering route. Of course, there are many more things to think about like:   Math makes you a better programmer. Avoiding it is limiting yourself. Great foundation on theory makes you a better programmer as well. Even though that I knew how to program before, after a couple of semesters in UCF in the CS program made a huge difference on me. No grad school   Remember, is not about learning technologies, that's why stackoverflow, YouTube, blogs and even reddit exist, you can learn them on your own without getting that degree.  But, of course. I'm biased."

It's online so it's flexible.  It's DirectConnect so it's cheaper as you pay Community College tuition for the first two years.  It also looks like it's more practical.    I think traditional CS is a better fit is you want to be doing algorithm development, or be cutting edge where math has a greater applicability.  For example, if you want to work for some of the Silicon Valley giants (Google, Apple, Facebook, etc) then I think traditional CS is the better route.

ucf,3ci1eb,Diz-Rittle,7,Wed Jul 8 02:49:10 2015 UTC,"It's really not... like the other guy said, if you're having this much trouble, you should maybe reconsider your major because this is like the sugar coating on a really really nasty math cake.  I'll just add that college should be about exploring what you want to do and what you're good at.  Look at the strengths in your life and build on that.  If you work on something you love, you will excel at it and you can make a career out of it.  Example, some people like bugs.  Then they go into bug degrees and make entire lives out of bugs.  Just because you've been told engineering is good doesn't mean it's for everyone.  Trying to excel at something you hate will be painful and at the end, you will find your work unfulfilling."

ucf,3ci1eb,thaeffingenius,2,Thu Jul 9 13:41:27 2015 UTC,"Give it your best shot, if you see you really aren't doing well in that class, do yourself a favor and change your major. Summer session or not, it really shouldn't be that difficult. College algebra is not usually considered a weed-out course, especially in engineering majors, at least by anybody I've ever spoken to. If you're struggling this much in College Algebra then I really don't think you can handle Calc 2, or most of the other engineering classes. Good luck.  source: Mech engineering student who just switched to comp sci"
ucf,3ci1eb,Crowsnevermore,2,Wed Jul 8 07:02:54 2015 UTC,"The homework honestly helps with the class. The homework teaches you better than the professor for college algebra, or from what I experienced. Homework is the main teaching tool because you're repeatedly practicing the formulas . Aren't MALL hours required still or was that changed? Are you working or taking another class as well? Or is this your first summer class? Summer A and B classes are always accelerated versions of the spring/fall course version, so you'll have to double down on the time you dedicate to getting your work done.  You may have to rethink your work ethic in regards to your major as well. If you're not willing to step up on starting your homework earlier, especially for math courses, then the industrial engineer core courses are going to be hell. IIRC you still have up to Calc 3 to do, differentials, linear, thermo, etc. I'm not trying to freak you out, but build up your work ethic in regard to schoolwork now with college algebra. You're bound to take a core class during the summer that will be 10x the difficulty of algebra.  If you think you need tutoring, I can help out (after doing a quick skim through). But really, with mathematics, you need to do the homework to grasp the concept even if it seems tedious."
ucf,3ci1eb,subterfug,1 point,Wed Jul 8 20:21:04 2015 UTC,I could help you out...I tutored math a couple levels above algebra. Message me if you're interested and we could talk numbers. You shouldn't stress.

ucf,3cdofi,Steaknshakeyardboys,1 point,Wed Jul 8 23:19:50 2015 UTC,"It's pretty terrible, in terms of accessibility. There is no ""walkable"" nightlife area, like there are near most college campuses, so you have to rely on the shuttle system (which is not great, but at least it's available) or drive (and finding a DD). If you have someone who always wants to drive and never drink, then I'm sure UCF nightlife is fine. But it was extremely difficult for me to find safe passage, and the shuttle system was not close to my (many) apartment complexes so it wasn't available for use.  Back in the day when I went to UCF, we had the Plaza right across Alafaya so that was walkable and fun, but when I went back for homecoming last year, I think the closest bar I saw was like a mile down University.   Downtown is pretty diverse and I like the nightlife down there, but getting there from UCF side of town is such a hassle.   I think my first couple of years there I just went to a ton of house parties anyway, since I wasn't really allowed in most of the bars anyway. I could get in Scoop, Pounders and Library but I'm not even sure if those exist anymore."

Yes fixing it will take would create millions of job openings and they're jobs that could easily be around for decades before everything's fixed and/or updated.  Its not like thats his only plan to create jobs and its not even his biggest arguement of how to make them.  I just don't see how that's out of touch.  Paul Krugman is easily one of the smartest, if not the smartest  economist in the world today and he spent a good portion of his book ""End this depression now"" explaining how this would help enormously."

It's easy to grow fast and be happy when your population is so homogeneous and small. The comparison to pretty much any european country is highly fallible because of how different our cultures are. There's just now way it would work. Also, the US has a comparible GDP to the entirety of the EU despite having maybe 60% of the population. Explain that. We also contribute about 40% of the medical research being put out. That's because the incentive of monetary gain causes companies to continuously innovate. Europe barely contributes anything to the world relative to the US. The Technological sector is based in the US and Asia. Maybe they make better cars, but we make better space ships.  Edit: Look at what's happening to europe because of their social welfare programs. People are immigrating to the countries for the sake of taking advantage of them and not actually providing anything. Immigration is a huge issue there. Here people break into the country to work and make a better life for themselves. That speaks volumes on the topic of the capability of each respective mindset."

Part of my job means I come home late every night (I work until anywhere from 3am to 7am). Coming home at these times I get to see security ""doing there job"" and have an honest assessment. At those times they were almost always either asleep or talking all together in a group. This kind of activity is posing zero deterrent to any possible security threat. They also complete perimeter checks swiftly on a golf cart and rarely if every check hallways/stairwells. They certainly are not preventing anything, look at the recent resurgence in crime activity in the last few weeks.

Most students do it.  10 hours is pretty reasonable.  You could start there and gradually add in more hours.  I used to work overnights on campus for Housing and was taking 17 credits in spring.  Besides Physics (which I'm absolutely terrible at no matter what I do) and a lab I slept through one time too many, I did well in my classes.  I worked the max that I was allowed to work, which was ~32 hours a week (some weeks a little less).  I quit so I can focus on physics for Summer B and pass so I don't ever have to take this damn class ever again.  Honestly, if you're good with your time management, you should be okay.  You also don't have the added stress of NEEDING to work since you have enough for your necessities, so you won't feel like you need to take on more and more work.  Hell, you could safely maybe even go up to 20, but if you never worked during school before, I suggest starting as slow as you can."

Obviously staying with my parents is the easiest and most cost-effective solution, but I've lived in a dorm before and not having your parents living with you is great. I want that sense of indepence again, but evidently freedom costs a lot. What's better in terms of money and overall quality, a dorm or an apartment? The dorms at UCF are pretty expensive ($3,000??) but they're safe, nice, more convenient and full of friends, etc. The apartments are cheap.  I don't know how much money I can count with, but most likely not enough seeing as how I don't have a job yet and I'm riding on scholarships and FAFSA.

I'm involved in a lot of classes and activities on campus during the fall/spring so commuting more than an hour each day would be hell.  As far as on versus off campus, I think a lot depends on transportation and cost. You need a car or to take the shuttle if you're off campus, and some of the luxury apartments can run quite high. I enjoy being on campus since I never have to drive/find parking and am always a short walk away to class/food. A lot of people prefer off campus though, since you do get more for your money as far as amenities, and you can be closer to bars or other parts of town."

The good thing about internships in this field, aside from the invaluable experience, is that many of them pay very well.

Honestly, it's not a bad idea to take Calc 1 since you're a CS major and will have to take more math down the line. From my experience, Calc 1 at UCF is much more difficult than the Calculus AB exam.  Or you could always give Valencia a shot."
ucf,3c4rhl,bungiebob86,2,Sat Jul 4 23:53:18 2015 UTC,"Overall it seems better to always go straight into the higher level if possible. See this article for an interesting read on it.  I was advised to retake calc 1 after getting a 5 on the AB exam (first year advisors are idiots) and it was terrible advice. The review for me was so tedious I lost all motivation and it wound up being my worst grade through out all of college. I did very well in Calc 2, 3, and DiffEq - I just couldn't stand spending so much effort retaking a class I did well in already."
ucf,3c4rhl,bungiebob86,2,Sun Jul 5 02:59:00 2015 UTC,I believe placing into Calc 2 requires a 5 on the AB exam. Skipping both requires a 5 on both AB and BC.

This can get you another 2,000 in a semester"

The easiest one in the bunch in my opinion was physiology.  Take notes in lecture and do well on your labs and presentation and you'll be fine.   I never made it to orgo 2, but if you actually learned some stuff from orgo 1, it'll help out a little bit in micro when white teaches about different cellular mechanisms.  Micro lab was pretty brutal. Don't get me wrong, it was fun and I learned a lot, but you better memorize everything about everything if you want to pass the lab practical at the end of the semester.  Lecture was difficult as well, but white curved a lot.  Immunology was harder than it seems at first, but Weigel's a nice guy and helpful in office hours. There were 6 tests, he drops your lowest and the final replaced the next lowest score.  Bottom line, it's a lot of material to try and learn at once. I would never even attempt this, especially with all the practice you need to spend on orgo. I'm anxious just looking at this schedule. Best of luck."

Ratna's class, Biochem II and Infectious (if Teter teaches it) won't be easy. The rest shouldn't be as bad.  And honestly, with Pharmacy school, there's a lot more than the classes you take. Many people who apply only have the pre-requisites because they don't have their bachelors. I wouldn't take bullshit for classes, but it's not necessary for every class to be super medicine focused.

I also understand not wanting to stay at CC for too long. Though I have been at UCF and at a CC - I have to say there are definitely a lot of benefits to getting your gen ed done at community college.  If you want to transfer, make sure you really do get a good GPA and don't just take easy classes to get it. They will notice. Fortunately you have a good SAT score so maybe they will be more lenient. If you don't mind paying the application fee then you might as well apply after a semester. I would think you're more likely to get in after a year of CC with a good GPA though."

ucf,3bsm1y,CAxVIPER,1 point,Wed Jul 1 21:15:34 2015 UTC,If you take one semester and get all A you have a 4.0. They are going to look at credit hours and GPA.

If you're in the Orlando area, you should go and see the model and walk around the interiors of Phase I and Phase II and explore the Greek row area. Just to give you a feel and ask residents."

Some other places to look, with shuttles, in your price range, and had openings last I checked:    The Quad Arden Villas need to find your own roommate,  Knights Landing need to find your roommate Orion Windmill Point need to find your own roommate   Basically if you go to LiveSomeWhere/UCF at the bottom of the page you can see all communities within two miles, which are more or less the ones on the shuttle route. Your price range will get you something $$$ or less."

Things change in 3-4 years, so always keep that in mind and do summer internships over summer courses if you can. It may take a little longer to graduate wait but the experience is worth it.  Lastly, don't be afraid to take GENed courses at Valencia, its cheaper and often easier."

ucf,3bnrz7,JuanAG31,2,Tue Jun 30 18:41:05 2015 UTC,"as a SME in this area, if you are planning on parking during the weekend (Sat & Sun) parking services is lenient for not having a permit as long as you are in the green student lots or garages. Make sure you are not parked in a B/C faculty/staff space. During the week, you would have to park in Garage F if you choose not to pay for parking. Good luck!"

ucf,3bkjbv,synkronize,6,Mon Jun 29 23:44:14 2015 UTC,"My girlfriend lived at the Pointe in a 2 bed 2 bath. Overall, it's not a terrible place. Maintenance was pretty bad, they will put the least amount of time possible into fixing issues. Really half ass. I wont go into detail with the issues they had.. If I did, they'd probably have enough information to figure out who she is (not sure if it's a big deal at the Pointe, I've just heard horror stories about people living elsewhere getting in trouble over negative reviews because of something they agreed to in their lease agreement)  One thing I can't stress enough is that you need to take pictures of the entire apartment during your walk through. This is a good practice when you're renting/buying anywhere. With a good camera, document everything, even things that might not look off. You want to be able to go back to those pictures and be able to see every single inch in case something comes up, because they might try to blame you for it. They sent out a notice to everyone recently giving a list of things that need to be done before the move out date. I wish I had it to post here. The checklist they provided looks like something you'd pay a professional cleaning service thousands for. I understand cleaning before moving out is important, but I thought the list was over the top. They tell you to return it to the condition it was in when you moved in. Having pictures of the before will be handy if they try to charge her for anything, which I have a feeling they will. The place was quite dirty when they moved in.  Anyway, I don't mean to turn you off to it. It's a good place. Just take precautions as you should anywhere. Good luck!"
ucf,3bkjbv,Taylor_Reddit,2,Tue Jun 30 00:54:07 2015 UTC,"I had a major problem with the management when I lived there, but to my knowledge those specific people have all been fired/ left the area. When I lived there that was about the price range of a 4 bedroom apt. As others have said maintenance is a bit meh, they take a while to fix non-emergencies and generally do only enough to keep getting paid. The Unlimited utility cap is a nice thing to have, especially if you're gonna be there over the summer, when the AC will really be working to keep your apt cool. you might hear a little noise from people on other floors, but in general unless you have someone playing Dance Dance Revolution above you you'll be fine. Be careful about parking if you have friends over, they are incredibly picky about visitor parking here, and it's quite limited.  Right now if you want bottom of the barrel for per-room rent Campus Crossing at Alafaya is right down the road, still has the bus route if you need it (a quicker one too), and they have a very nice electrical cap. (just make sure to grab a programmable thermostat and watch your AC usage in the summer, winter you won't have any trouble unless something is broken). Maintenance here is a lot faster and in general a better than at Pointe, though their drywall work is meh. The apts here have a bit thinner ceilings/floors than pointe, but still nothing too serious unless the guy above you is being very loud. Now for the interesting bits. Campus Crossings at Alafaya is really cheap for a reason... it's ghetto as hell in certain areas. I got lucky and live right near the frat house that's inside it, so it's a lot nicer. However there was an instance where I went in to pay my rent and a guy came in to put a work order in about bullet holes in his window. Stay away if you possibly can.  Some general tips if you choose to live anywhere off campus: If you have a bicycle, keep it IN the apt or it may get stolen, do NOT use any outdoor bike racks. As others have said make sure you DOCUMENT EVERYTHING YOU POSSIBLY CAN ABOUT THE APT WHEN YOU MOVE IN. Apt complexes make a bunch of money off of trying to keep your security deposit, so anything you don't document on the way in will be charged to it, and if that doesn't cover it all, to you. This also lends itself to maintenance calls, if something is broken, get maintenance to fix it unless it's an emergency, if you break it more after trying to DIY they may charge you for the fix. The shuttles that run off campus are always off schedule no matter where you live, so keep that in mind if you choose to live off campus where there is UCF shuttle service. If you have your own car, most places are going to require you to have a parking decal for their complex, which you will more than likely have to pay a per-lease term fee of around $20-$50. If you do have a car, I would seriously consider something a little farther away from UCF, that way you're not getting the: ""we're close to the college"" pricing, and you won't have to deal with as much crime as there is on Alafaya. The only problem with that is that places farther away from the college won't do per-room rent, but rather charge for the whole unit, so you'll either need to find a roommate, or up your budget for a one-bedroom. In monetary terms, for around the price that you said in your post, my brother and I are going to be renting a two-bedroom apt about 10 minutes away from the college."
ucf,3bkjbv,4magnum,1 point,Tue Jun 30 05:08:07 2015 UTC,"Used to live there some months ago.

I've loved living there though,great location, I love all of the staff and they've been really cool for the most part. I'm really close to the pool though and sometimes they would be blasting music out there for parties regardless if there were people there or not which got kind of annoying.

ucf,3bkjbv,Undercover_nerd87,1 point,Tue Jun 30 06:03:05 2015 UTC,Overall not so bad but they tried to charge me for 2 months when I signed a 10 month lease. They put it down in the system as 12 months instead so make sure you're on top of that.

So if any one knows other apartments that may not be full that aren't terrible that'd be great I have been looking at others and I know that the Marquees is a terrible place, according to reviews.

When my car was burgled, they just laughed in my face. And when I said my rent would be late because I had to get new windows, they said they couldnt do anything about it.

ucf,3bkjbv,Rogpog777,2,Tue Jun 30 00:51:44 2015 UTC,Yes anyone can tour. And since your a Valencia student you may be able to go ahead an sign a lease if your interested. They do UCF and Valencia students only so you could probably lease and then later tell them your now a UCF student. They are directly UCF affiliated so you can run your financial aid and what not through them.

Campus Crossings and The Marquee (formerly Sterling) are some of the only ones with a lot of availability left. Northgate Lakes is also open and comparable to The Pointe with a nicer location but a bit overpriced for what you're getting.   Let me know if you have any other questions.

With unlimited, there's no way you'll eat three times a day seven days a week, or even five, on campus.   Even so, the five day a week one and the 7 day unlimited plan don't include all the retail swipes anymore. Now it's just Java city, Starbucks, and einsteins. It's a total rip off now.

That was only the case in Fall 2013 when course was offered as an option, but was not required to graduate. The Senior Design courses are now required by anyone switching into the CS program or starting the program. Due to the demand (as people need it to graduate) they have 2 options currently. One cycle starts in fall (fall/spring) and another one starts in spring (spring/fall). Dr. Heinrich does not teach over summer. If an additional faculty member helps, they have discussed a spring/summer and summer/fall option.  Hope this helps.

ucf,3b32mr,DeoxyriBROse,12,Fri Jun 26 01:31:45 2015 UTC,"Okay so as a regular build guy who frequents the gym this is my explanation, (quick disclaimer* I don't wear the string types of tank tops) but I wear tank tops to the gym for two primary reasons:  The first is freedom of motion and not having annoying extra fabric that might limit my range of motion. wearing a tank top allows my arms to have complete and total range with no restrictions.  The second and potentially egotistic/controversial reason I enjoy wearing tank tops is I can see my muscles at work, when I am doing my normal routine exercises I can look in the mirror and watch how changing my form will engage more of the muscle groups that I am targeting. I also get a little bit of a rush when I see this because it is exciting to see my personal improvements at work.  So getting down to it IMO the whole string/cutout tank tops are a bit controversial but some people might have other reasons than just wearing the minimal amount of clothing to show off their muscles. Honestly there comes a point where I feel these rules become a little ""Middle/High school esque"" college should be a time of freedom of expression in all forms and if some meat heads want to express themselves by wearing tiny tank tops I think it should be allowed.   The only justification i could see is that maybe they don't want peoples sweaty bodies directly in contact with the equipment but what does that mean are we all going to have to wear long sleeves to workout?  I am not really here to root for or against the rule because it doesn't really affect me, but what I don't like about it is how UCF treats the RWC like its some special part of campus, I understand there are public indecency laws but how would average students feel if they were told what they can and can't wear to class, or color their hair.   Tldr; some people like flexing their muscles and watching themselves workout, everyone is entitled to their own freedom of expression, and it's silly that UCF has to make a dress code for college students.  (I'm sure my grammar sucks but that is why I'm engineering major)"
ucf,3b32mr,niknikbluhh,8,Thu Jun 25 20:24:57 2015 UTC,"Thank you dude, every time I try to explain this to people (who don't even go to the gym) their response is ""ohhh swolebro is pissed, we don't want your sweaty body"", sweet dude, I'll say this again, fat girls wear little baby shorts and get their booty sweat all up on my benches, but instead of causing a ruckus, I simply wipe it down with the wipes that are offered throughout the building and go on about my day.

That is a biased interview that makes proponents of stringer tanks look unintelligent. Stringer tanks do have a legitimate purpose in the weightroom. They prevent restriction of motion and the constricted feeling you would get from working out with a tight t-shirt. Another poster mentioned you can also identify muscles easier as you workout because muscles such as upper back, traps, and lats are not concealed. Stringer tanks have been a staple of weightrooms internationally for years and I have yet to hear of a freak accident (like this guy just fabricated) occurring because of them. I personally wear string tanks but I'm the farthest thing from a ""bro"" like the dudes featured in the interview and I don't do it to show off my muscles. The UCF gym is starting to sound like Planet Fitness.  The director of the UCF gym is frankly an idiot for saying such nonsense. It worries me that we have someone in charge of one of our facilities who has these crazy cockamamie ideas. Stop instituting stupid rules like these and buy more squat racks, create a controlled OHP area, and order more leg presses. There is 1 leg press that is shared amongst a 65,000 student body.

Knights Circle and Pointe at Central are full. Plaza on University is full, even University House is FULL. A new community called The Retreat is full (for males, they need female residents). All of which I listed are GREAT places to stay. Costs just vary and since I called them all (last week) they're full. I stress you call them and see if things have changed.  Each housing community has their own stipulations regarding the guarantor and even though it's hated, the Marquee is cheapest. Go for what you can afford.  Tivoli and Northgate Lake I heard are GREAT, I recommend looking into those.  I recommend looking at my topic I posted here not to long ago... http://www.reddit.com/r/ucf/comments/3996qa/previous_residents_of_whats_now_known_as_the/  In the end, I bit the bullet and decided on the Marquee everything else is either too expensive or full.

ucf,3azuz2,Parkn1ght,6,Wed Jun 24 20:58:48 2015 UTC,You get to go to the MALL for 3 hours a week and do homework. Doesn't that sound exciting?
ucf,3azuz2,Ticks,3,Wed Jun 24 21:07:08 2015 UTC,Sounds great! /sarcasm.  What exactly is that?
ucf,3azuz2,Cynical-C,9,Wed Jun 24 21:13:02 2015 UTC,"The ""Mathematics Assistance and Learning Lab.""  Here is how college algebra and a few other low level math classes at UCF work.   You go to lecture once a week. Attendance is taken. The lecture goes over what you can expect to find in that week's homework.  Each week you are assigned online homework. Once you have completed the homework you take the online quiz. You have 7 tries on the quiz.  Every 4-5 weeks you have a major exam. This exam is taken in the MALL.   Here is the shitty part. You are expected to spend 3 hours each week in the MALL. The only thing the MALL contains is computers that can go onto the website that you do homework on. You are expected to spend the 3 hours doing your homework and quiz for that week. Most people can get all that done in 1-2 hours leaving you a third to ""do more practice problems."" If they see you not doing math related (just sitting there, on your phone, etc) they take away points for that week.  The MALL is filled with tutors who can help you, or in most cases, help the people next to you... loudly.   The MALL fills up at certain times of the day and you may actually have to wait in line to do your homework.  If you get under 3 hours for a week, you do not get any MALL credit for that week. The MALL counts for 10% of your grade (when I took it 4 years ago).  The minimum amount of time you can spend in the MALL is 15 minutes. If you leave before that time, you get 0 minutes toward your MALL time for that week. That means if you leave after 2 hrs and 59 minutes, you have to go back in and do 15 more minutes.   It is arguably the worst system UCF has in place. May God have mercy on your soul."
ucf,3azuz2,eric101995,2,Wed Jun 24 21:33:06 2015 UTC,Well that sounds dandy.  Sigh  Thank you for the explanation though.
ucf,3azuz2,Steaknshakeyardboys,2,Wed Jun 24 22:00:29 2015 UTC,A tip I found helpful is there is a separate classroom on the bottom floor of the math building (same building the MALL is in) that has tutors that I found much more helpful than MALL tutors. You don't get hours for it but if you already did your three hours but still need help I would recommend the math lab.
ucf,3azuz2,ThinBraStraps,1 point,Thu Jun 25 05:37:04 2015 UTC,"Took that a year ago semester B. We had no limit on how many times we take our quizzes. We also had other MALL Activities to do before we took our tests. Pay attention to these, if you have them--they're literally the same questions/question types that your test will be on.  Also of note is that the Pearson software gives you 3 tries to answer a question, and will show you the specific steps on how to answer that problem type. The software is often buggy or works badly, but you can use it effectively to get your work done and do well on the tests. Good luck :)"

College courses are move much faster than high school courses, and only getting 50 minutes of instruction per week was not enough.  If you are good at math or familiar with the material, you will be fine. If not, start looking for resources to use during the semester - instruction videos on Youtube, Khan Academy, tutoring centers, and make sure you find people to study with at the beginning of the semester."

ucf,3b0hjk,deadmemories1,1 point,Thu Jun 25 03:33:24 2015 UTC,Yes! This is exactly what happened! Only difference between this years fafsa and Valencia was that I filed my taxes for the first time (worked a part time job). Does this change at all?
ucf,3b0hjk,deadmemories1,1 point,Thu Jun 25 03:39:43 2015 UTC,"Probably. If you had no income the last time you filled out FAFSA (which I assume because you didn't file taxes), then this time you had income to report, then your income for the year got added to the FEI and probably put you over the limit."

ucf,3b0hjk,nn123654,1 point,Thu Jun 25 03:48:53 2015 UTC,"Well you were just reporting your income from the past year (from when you had last did your fafsa), they don't need a constant update of if your income changes. Just a total of what you made in that certain time.  This is all from my understanding of it. So take that with a grain of salt. I've never changed it immediately when my employment changed. Only the yearly update of it."
ucf,3b0hjk,ctontt,1 point,Thu Jun 25 04:44:14 2015 UTC,Probably not if it's a close to minimum wage part time job. The whole point of the FASFA is to determine your income so they can determine your financial need. Generally speaking more earned money = less need based aid because they assume you ought to be able to pay for some of it on your own. For pell grants and other need based aid it depends on how much your financial need is (how little you make). Above around $20k/year the amount you get awarded for pell grants starts to go down and gradually tapers until you aren't eligible for anything. You will always qualify for unsubsidized stafford loans no matter how much you make.

ucf,3au47f,Oen386,3,Wed Jun 24 10:53:20 2015 UTC,"I thought this was good at first because it might force UCF to use the budget for things that make sense   That is kind of a self centered response, implying the projects were poor choices.  The additional campus is to accommodate the growing programs and research. Between business, health & public affairs, and engineering almost all the building space is used. HEC (engineering) just removed their study areas to make new offices since there aren't any more available between their three buildings. These projects are exactly what you want them spending money on, so they don't re-purpose other spaces into more offices or labs.  Additionally, the stuff with the performance hall was to help improve the art programs at UCF, which in all honestly seems to get the scraps of whatever is left after all the STEM programs. Both seemed like very worthy projects to fund, and the most annoying part is the state money was just supposed to get them started. As far I'm aware they are going to sit on hold until more funding is found, delaying them further. :/"
ucf,3au47f,Red_Raven,-1,Wed Jun 24 12:15:30 2015 UTC,"Yah, it is self-centered. I don't mind the parking so much because I don't drive YET, and there are tons of shuttles, and you can bike. But when finals time comes around and I can't find a good place to study because the library is full and AKS was so poorly designed that it's always full, I have a problem. UCF still has tons of land, and the first thing on the list should be a big study hall. Yes, other programs are struggling, and that needs to be fixed, but it is a STEM school. Also, I thought to lot they tore up was for a foreign exchange student center. Still, it should be on new land, not rare parking spaces. You can't support however many thousands of students if they can't park or find a good place to study what they came here to learn. I'm sure art students can use study and parking space. Full disclosure, I'm an electrical engineering major."
ucf,3au47f,Oen386,2,Wed Jun 24 13:52:15 2015 UTC,"I think you missed my entire point, or you chose to ignore it. With this project not being approved, your study areas are being reduced/removed and parking is going to stay the same or get worse.  The two concerns you listed both would have improved if these projects had been funded. You need to look at the bigger picture, and not have such a short sighted view on things. By moving a program downtown, more office and lab space will open up on campus and they will stop removing study areas like they did in engineering (your own college). With programs and classes moving downtown parking will improve here, at least for a while until the space is utilized fully again.   Still, it should be on new land, not rare parking spaces.   They built parking garages so the ground lots could be re-purposed. It's the idea of keeping everything central, not like UF where students have to drive between most of their classes.   there are tons of shuttles, and you can bike.   You even gave the solution to the parking problem yourself, after the initial freshman rush in fall everyone realizes they don't need to drive their own vehicle to UCF. They find out it is close enough to bike, walk, or take a shuttle. If you look around, after the initial rush in fall, there is parking everywhere. Is there parking within 10 feet of the building you would like? No. Garage A is regularly half full at best throughout each semester, just no one wants to be bothered walking (similar to those people the circle the first floor for 20 minutes rather than park a level up). :/   I'm sure art students can use study and parking space.   That's a weak response. Their programs lack a lot of the resources your college has. I'm guessing you've never been to a music performance. Other than the Symphony Under the Stars, which takes place outside, there is no space adequately large enough for the concert musicians to perform. Even theatre performances a very intimate affair with how small the seating is (looking at you Black Box Theatre).  tl;dr You're arguments are weak. You failed to acknowledge how these projects would address the two concerns you gave."

Get used to walking/biking/boarding to class, it'll save you time and will give you a moderate exercise depending on where you'll living.   As for dorm parking, look here for information on student permits and if your dorm uses a specific lot. Go to Parking Services (by Garage B) when you get on campus and get a sticker/hang tag so as not to be fined. Double check everywhere you park on campus to make sure you're not in a faculty/staff spot. The more you drive, the more likely you are to park somewhere wrong and get a parking ticket.

ucf,3ax9qu,MickCollins,2,Wed Jun 24 07:27:30 2015 UTC,"I believe I received two tickets over the course of my time at UCF. The second was two weeks before I graduated. My tags expired in May and I was taking classes in June. Someone had to go out of their way to ticket me, because my license plate was backed up to one of the cement bars in Garage B. I didn't bother fighting it because all I wanted to do was get out of there."
ucf,3ax9qu,Taylor_Reddit,2,Wed Jun 24 18:10:37 2015 UTC,"If you truly believe the ticket to be incorrect, build a logical case for yourself and fight it. I was cited with something that I legitimately believed was not wrong, so I cited their bylaws in my dispute and why I believed I was in the right and it ended up being found in my favor.  The committee that sees these cases is definitely reasonable. If you did actually do something wrong and they know it, admit to it and note that you've made changes to fix whatever it was. If it's your first offense, from what I've heard on r/ucf it's likely to be dropped."

ucf,3ascxt,Speedeh,1 point,Tue Jun 23 14:00:17 2015 UTC,"Crime is just a problem in the overall UCF area. That being said there was one incident while I was living here. I haven't seen any mold. Raccoons just try to get into your trash. As long as you close the trash container outside of the room properly you won't have any issues with them.  I've only seen one cockroach. I've never had to talk to management other than picking up packages so I can't really comment much about this. They just changed management companies too so take those reviews with a grain of salt.   I chose not to re-sign due to the fact that I'm looking to find a house with some friends and would like to have some more freedoms. Overall, this place isn't so bad there are some pros like the rooms are pretty big but there are some cons like the kitchen appliances, at least in my apartment are pretty out of date.  Hopefully this helps. You also have to keep in mine that his has been my experience with living here. I don't know if this falls along the same lines with everyone's experience while living here."

Much of housing is overbooked so switches that are not agreed upon are often denied because they can't force someone to leave. The only Other way to get a room change is by showing there is some reason you cannot live with your current roommate/suite-mate be it they're uncleany and you  have allergies or you're starting to fight, but as someone mentioned petty things are not generally  passed. And even then they generally don't let people pick the room they go to unless there is an agreed upon swap. Best of luck with your room change."

The pay usually about $3 above minimum wage for on campus jobs and most UCF offered jobs tend to be really flexible with hours since they want to make sure that your classes take precedence. If you want to find a job on campus, the best, most efficient, and pretty much only way is to keep an eye on the website Knight Linked (https://ucf-csm.symplicity.com/students/). There aren't always opening but just keep searching on here for ones relating to UCF Colleges and you should be able to find a pretty fun job. Good luck!"

I've spent now two years at Orion and it was great but I want something bigger the apt just seem so small after a while.

ucf,3ad3al,comeupoutdawahta,6,Fri Jun 19 10:32:55 2015 UTC,Yup.  Like 80% of the money my team raised came from checks written by our families.  That class was a complete waste of time.
ucf,3ad3al,deafcon,2,Fri Jun 19 22:32:01 2015 UTC,"Gawd I took him in 2012... Bleh. I did the math, if my team mates and I would have just went to work rather than taking collectively 50 hours/week off (10 hours each) for 6 weeks, and just donated that money, we would have had over 10x our goal plus we could have a charitable donation for our taxes... Fuck that. The class was kinda fun though."
ucf,3ad3al,Irlyh8usernames,13,Sat Jun 20 00:17:39 2015 UTC,"The class was only ""popular"" because it was mandatory for Business Administration students. I was not in COBA but many of my friends were and everybody hated that class."
ucf,3ad3al,XmusJaxonFlaxonWaxon,10,Sat Jun 20 01:28:28 2015 UTC,"This class was seriously awful.  The professor put me to sleep most of the time and I had to watch him at 1.2x speed because he also did talk really slow.  The raising money portion for a grade is, I think, what made this the most ridiculous part of anything. I still can't believe this class lasted as long as it did."
ucf,3ad3al,Knightro2011,9,Fri Jun 19 03:22:57 2015 UTC,"The class used to be drastically different than it is now.  Back when I took it in '99, there was no raising money for charities, it was instead a major weed out class.  We were required to do business level presentations and reports, had to spend hours in the library researching, and the break out session leaders were the strictest graders I ever saw.  I had Mrs Putchinski, and while she and I had issues in cornerstone, she was the one that drove me the hardest.  That class (along with finance) were the courses used to weed out the people who really didn't fit in."
ucf,3ad3al,UCFCO2001,8,Fri Jun 19 13:38:31 2015 UTC,That sounds a lot like something the CBA could use actually. I've had classes with countless lazy party students who really don't have any business being in college.
ucf,3ad3al,MickCollins,3,Fri Jun 19 15:13:20 2015 UTC,"That's how I remember it. What's this raising money for charity shit?  I can't names for who I had for Cornerstone (section or lecture) but the lecture guy wasn't bad - I remember he used to be at Eastman Kodak.   You really had to get into your shit and figure out who the major players were in your assigned sector and how they were doing, and give a state of their business and whether you thought they were going to move up or down in the sector - then justify it. I thought it was a great way for BA students to interact.  But what the fuck do I know? The CBA eliminated my major."

ucf,3ad3al,deafcon,3,Fri Jun 19 21:07:03 2015 UTC,"That sounds similar to what Capstone is now, though it's obviously not a weedout class."
ucf,3ad3al,UCFCO2001,2,Fri Jun 19 22:02:29 2015 UTC,Capstone back then was really a much more intensive version of cornerstone.  You were expected to do twice the work in only a 3 credit course
ucf,3ad3al,article134,9,Sat Jun 20 00:20:45 2015 UTC,Lmao fuck everything about cornerstone. I took it while I was working two jobs and it was literally like having a third on top of that. Worthless.  I learned nothing. I raised money for a stupid charity I don't care about. And it did nothing to further my education.
ucf,3ad3al,UCFCO2001,4,Sat Jun 20 00:39:11 2015 UTC,They're also going to be putting a test together (if it's not already in place) for admission to the CBA.  Should weed out some people.

ucf,3ad3al,rollDeezStones,2,Fri Jun 19 22:22:19 2015 UTC,it's basically a glorified fundraising class.
ucf,3ad3al,rollDeezStones,4,Mon Jun 22 12:27:59 2015 UTC,"I know this class got hate from nearly everyone I know who took it, but I personally came away with a very positive experience from it when I took it after transferring from Valencia three years ago. I came to UCF as a very introverted individual who couldn't make presentations in front of a class to save his life and this was really the first class that forced me to step outside of my comfort zone and into a leadership role for the group I worked with. For some people I'm sure the class is a waste of time but for people like myself I think it's kind of a shame that it's being taken off the curriculum"

I haven't been there in awhile but if I remember correctly it's your typical car wash, takes 1 dollar coins, there's a couple spots for vacuuming, all self serve. Looks a little run down but it has everything I needed to wash my car. You can always go to Bills on the other end of Colonial, and they're good, but I don't really consider that a self service wash since you pull up, take a brush they provided to get the bugs off your front bumper, then pay to have your car washed in a drive through car wash.

Be prepared for test questions with answers like: A, B, C, AB, BC, and other questions like: choose all that apply.  Also be prepared to study. The first test results had less than 20 A's but more than (IIRC) 120 C's"
ucf,3a89o1,Fiblah,2,Thu Jun 18 01:58:54 2015 UTC,"Do they curve similarly? And are the test questions all from the ppts; are there any surprises or is it all fair? By same types of questions, u mean they're similar, or the same?"
ucf,3a89o1,plaindan69,2,Thu Jun 18 02:22:36 2015 UTC,"Hey, I actually just graduated with a degree in biomed. I haven't heard about ambivero but White is the actual director of the Bio department I believe. She's been teaching here for about 50 years now I think and she knows how to teach. If they use the same slides/tests then it's going to be from White, and when I took her she told you what was important.  Curve wise I believe that a 75 is an A or something similar. Test questions are hardest ones you'll see in biomed, they're meant to be ""gotcha"" questions. That said with the curve it is very doable."
ucf,3a89o1,Fiblah,1 point,Thu Jun 18 04:32:33 2015 UTC,"Ambivero gave us 4 free questions on the test, and there was also an extra 2 question curve after the fact. She said there won't be a further curve for that test because the results ""were a perfect bell curve""  There weren't any surprises and all the questions came straight from the powerpoints. The wording was just tricky, and very detailed.  Ambivero said her questions are formatted exactly how White's questions are, so no matter who you take, the tests will be difficult."
ucf,3a89o1,Valese18,3,Thu Jun 18 17:15:21 2015 UTC,"You'll learn a lot with White, but be prepared to WORK for that grade.  She curves tremendously but if you're not at least hitting the class average on all the tests, it won't help at all.  I remember the second test was particularly rough, and the class average for that one was somewhere in the low 40s when I took the class.  The lab was brutal.  You need to know everything about EVERYTHING, every reagent you use and its chemical makeup, properties and all the tests you run on your organisms.  There are two unknown bacteria you need to identify in the last month of class.  I got one right but not the other, and still managed to get a 7/10.  I didn't enjoy the class much at all, and it's second to physics in terms of how much I disliked it.  I liked Anatomy and Orgo much better than Microbio.  However, White is very nice in office hours and tries her best to help you out if you ask for it.  Never had Ambivero, but if you opt to take it with White, you NEED to study every day and don't skip your classes/labs.  Pay attention, take good notes, yada yada.  I found the book to be helpful, though some people have said they just rely on powerpoints.   The book did a good job of explaining everything in simple terms and had some useful diagrams/charts/tables/etc.    Best of luck!"

His point is that if you want to get hired and do a good job then you will need to have something worthwhile on your resume and in your abilities.  So you will likely need to practice by creating your own applications that are fairly substantial. If it's something you can whip up in a couple of hours as a beginner, then it's not likely to impress anyone in the industry.  If you'd like to work in software engineering, getting a Comp Sci minor would be helpful.  BTW, Udemy.com is a great place to learn new computer skills.

When you go to court they literally ask you for your name and if the officer isn't present (which is the main case unless you were being an absolute prick during the traffic stop), you get dismissed and carry on with your life. You get 0 points and no fine this way."
ucf,39mcio,ToplessEskimo,2,Sat Jun 13 17:08:37 2015 UTC,"This is exactly how you do it. The only con is, you have to take time off work or from school to make it to the court.  When you pay a service like the ones mentioned in this thread, they handle showing up to court for you, as representation. The problem I see with the services is that they typically offer to have you pay the full fine, as long as the judge agrees to no points or school. The court wants your money, and this is a quick easy middle ground to get your money.  It's better to go in person over paying someone else. You might pay nothing, but it isn't a guarantee. Worst case you can make the same offer, you don't mind paying the fine but would like to prevent points going on your license and increasing your insurance."

They are able to detect things like botnets or spam broadcasters, but it only identifies by physical address of the machine through their system.   If your computer is infected badly enough to be affecting the network, SIRT sends CS&T an email saying ""yo, machine with MAC <whatever> has been blocked from network access"". CS&T looks up the machine, since you registered it, and then tell you or housing that you need to fix your problem in order to get access back.   WPA2 isn't covered by this policy as they can simply block you from wireless and you'll either give up or go to the Tech Product Center for help. UCF wireless is a courtesy service anyway, meaning that it is NOT a priority if issues come up.  Additionally, you need to register your machine as they are most likely using registered/manual DHCP for the residential network. This means that if you plug in a non-registered computer you just won't receive an IP address to communicate with and won't be able to connect to anything.   Source: tech employee on campus"

As /u/R4D10Active has said, they are always watching.    Here's the thing - just don't do it.  It's not worth the disciplinary actions that they can take.

I'm not saying they didn't say that, only that if they did, they're either not familiar with the network they're running, they're bluffing, or something similar. Maybe they did employ some basic methods of blocking archaic versions of file sharing protocols, and if they did, a simple test would show you they're not effective to any modern versions of those protocols."

I honestly don't think Goldwater gives THAT much work. He emails an excel assignment every week that contains 30 or 50 multiple choice questions and 2/3/4 longer problems requiring excel knowledge that he'll teach you in class. His tests are also emailed and he'll give at least 2 weeks to take them. The questions from those are taken straight from the homework he gives out weekly.  Goldwater might seem like a hardass at first, but he was a great professor that really loves teaching and he really wants to help us. I feel like a lot of people read check his RMP and end up not giving him a chance or they're annoyed that they have to learn how to use excel instead of regurgitating answers onto a pearson website.  Also, bring to class a laptop running windows and the newest edition of excel."

ucf,39jvv3,rollDeezStones,2,Fri Jun 12 17:53:08 2015 UTC,For example there are 5 very long problems for the homework via my accounting lab. I did the study problems and input each question in its original format into excel and had it calculate the answers based on the prompt. So the homework/study questions/tests only differ in numbers but the format is the same. I would do all the leg work initially on formatting the problem to spit out what answer I wanted as long as I changed the initial numbers. I might have some example spreadsheets in my email if you want to take a look. it saved me although it took a while.
ucf,39jvv3,acctgtaxbig4,2,Fri Jun 12 18:00:40 2015 UTC,"be sure to take advantage of free Microsoft Office software given to UCF students.  I signed up for Cost Accounting thinking I could get away with using LibreOffice but Goldwater let us know that functions will work differently in other software.  thankfully, the aforementioned offer was provided in the same semester I took it.  It would also be useful to have a laptop for the class since he walks you through the problems relating to Excel formatting."

There's plenty of off-campus bookstores, online bookstores, and other students you can get the book from for a lot cheaper. During finals week, the library can get really crowded. You can also study in tech commons, classroom buildings, all knight study, and the upper levels of the student union.  Keep an eye out for free events, such as Homecoming or Universal Knights.

ucf,399cqh,Sgtblazing,4,Wed Jun 10 13:57:36 2015 UTC,Don't shit where you eat Study
ucf,399cqh,MarcusMariato8,4,Wed Jun 10 05:29:41 2015 UTC,Don't study. Eat shit. Take good notes so you don't get concepts mixed up.
ucf,399cqh,WhyAmINotStudying,2,Wed Jun 10 10:52:38 2015 UTC,Always carry an umbrella.
ucf,399cqh,zeglo,4,Thu Jun 11 04:26:22 2015 UTC,"There are a few good bathrooms on campus:    In the breezeway by the bookstore, single bathroom = privacy   Any bathroom in the physics building.   If you've got the time, go here Second floor of Engineering II,  handicapped single bathroom = privacy"
ucf,399cqh,GleichUmDieEcke,1 point,Wed Jun 10 11:39:59 2015 UTC,Likewise ones to avoid at all costs:    Bathrooms behind tech commons Anything in MAP
ucf,399cqh,SinisterTitan,0,Thu Jun 11 04:43:31 2015 UTC,2 is accurate. I was talking to my advisor in that building and the bathrooms are glorious and precious
ucf,399cqh,bungiebob86,1 point,Mon Jun 22 07:06:42 2015 UTC,Do you have a major already picked out OP?
ucf,399cqh,kingpower01,2,Wed Jun 10 13:30:42 2015 UTC,Yeah biomedical sciences. Forgot to mention that.
ucf,399cqh,kingpower01,3,Wed Jun 10 20:47:45 2015 UTC,"So some tips I am going to give you others may not agree with but it is alright, everyone has different experiences. So my first tip is for your major, since you are pursuing Biomedical Sciences, I highly recommend using the Student Academic Resource Center (SARC) to your advantage if you are ever struggling or falling behind in a class. Its whole goal is to provide supplement instruction to UCF students and generally, there is a half to a whole letter grade difference between students who go and who do not go to SARC, specifically Supplemental Instruction. You do not need to worry about this just yet because your classes will probably announce who has one and who doesn't. My second piece of advice is to keep up with your work, don't let it be the end-all-be-all, but be sure to realize the differences between university and high school. This is your life for 4 (possibly more, if you wish) years. If you are pursuing a major like that, I definitely would pay attention and work hard all throughout your collegiate career but moreso in your beginning to build that foundation.  My next pieces of advice are more for anyone. You came to university to pursue a degree program that you may/may not enjoy, but that doesn't mean your college experience has to be all about the degree, this is the time of your life where you get to make your experience all about you. Don't forget about the future that you are trying to create, but don't also just live in that future because you won't get a chance to redo everything you do. It is okay to be interested in other things, do crazy and wild things you didn't think about before (not drugs ever though). If you want to learn more about engineering go ahead. If you want to learn more about theatre or a cappella, go ahead. If you want to learn more about helping your community, go ahead. All of these things are important because this makes you a more well-rounded individual and most people won't tell you this information. I am not giving you a spiel that everything will work out for the best if you take this track of life, but I can tell you that it is hell of a lot more enjoyable than spending everyday in the books. And trust me, my major already has me doing that but I realize that I need to go and do other things as well. If you wish to go enjoy your life and be adventurous, try rock climbing or crew or any of the other wonderful activities we have to offer.  UCF allows you to make your own experience. And the Internet will tell you all sorts of things, good/bad (mostly bad) but really in the end you get to make your own decision about this. Do whatever you want and you will be happy. But I say, strive for something out of yourself that you don't already have. If you are a shy guy, go out and meet new people, it won't be easy and it won't happen fast, but give it time and it will happen.  Finally, welcome to UCF, you are a part of our community and it is a pleasure to get the chance to go to a school with you and I hope in the end you enjoy your time and you end up graduating as a Knight."
ucf,399cqh,kingpower01,1 point,Fri Jun 12 00:48:22 2015 UTC,Wow! This is beyond helpful. Thank you so much for taking the time to write all this. I sincerely appreciate it and i definitely will try somethings new.
ucf,399cqh,eooe,1 point,Fri Jun 12 02:27:03 2015 UTC,"Absolutely! No problem. I happen to do some work for Orientations and can tell you that most of the advice I give you is from actual experiences people have and wish to pass onto others. I don't know if you happened to come to the Orientation today(and feel free not to answer that publicly or at all even)  or even this week. I and many others enjoy helping students succeed at UCF and are always willing to give you some advice and if we do not know the answer we know who to direct you to. Don't feel like you are on your own! We are all in this together, WIL-- Go Knights!"
ucf,399cqh,dyeokneesis,2,Fri Jun 12 02:41:26 2015 UTC,Thanks. I actually have orientation on July 15th i think or one of those days.
ucf,3996qa,rookie_coder,8,Wed Jun 10 04:01:55 2015 UTC,"For the most part, all the apartment places off of Alafaya are kind of sketch, though this is a huge generalization. But the marquee which used to be Sterling Central had a pretty bad reputation which is why they changed the name. I don't know if it's true but I remember hearing that a gang house used to be behind it. But when it comes to different housing complexes, check around the sub for previous threads.  In a VERY broad generalization, most things within a couple miles west and south of campus are a little sketch, colonial is sketchy as hell imho, but if you go north to Oviedo you can find some pretty good apartments for a decent price close to campus. Oviedo Grove comes to mind. (Is that the name? I hope it is). If you're an incoming freshman, on-campus housing isn't too bad and you get to meet a lot of other kids like you. It's a lot more in immersing. Though if you don't want to, that's cool too."
ucf,3996qa,datlaurel,5,Wed Jun 10 04:26:05 2015 UTC,Oviedo is absolutely where you want to live.
ucf,3996qa,kelifson,3,Wed Jun 10 06:28:29 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the reply. I'm an incoming transfer student. Oviedo Grove is it I believe, I'll research it tonight and call them in the morning.  I would stay on campus, but unfortunately, the only thing was available to me as a transfer is Rosen which is ~40 minute commute forget that noise."
ucf,3996qa,Valese18,5,Wed Jun 10 04:35:45 2015 UTC,"I've heard nothing but bad things about it.  The apartments were nice enough, but all of the people I know that lived there couldn't wait to sublease (and had somewhat of a hard time doing so).  I've gotten emergency alerts from things happening there quite a few times over the past couple of semesters.  There's a bad neighborhood right behind the complex, I've noticed the elevators and stairwells to be dirty on my visits there, and the facebook page has many in-depth reviews if you want to go and read them.  Names changing should be a red flag that the place usually does not have a good reputation."
ucf,3996qa,Taylor_Reddit,1 point,Wed Jun 10 04:33:56 2015 UTC,"I see. Thank you so much for the helpful information.  I'm definitely not staying there. I assumed that's why the name kept changing, I'm just getting frustrated with this housing search."
ucf,3996qa,ajs2294,2,Wed Jun 10 04:39:58 2015 UTC,"If I were you, I'd stay away from the immediate vicinity of the school. Most of the places targeted at students are pretty bad. North of the campus, Oviedo type area, and South, Avalon area, are much nicer. A 10-15 minute drive versus 5 isn't a huge deal.  The name changes are undoubtedly because of the terrible reputation they earn for themselves, plus notable crimes, many of which happen in or around there"
ucf,39808d,santiagorook,1 point,Tue Jun 9 22:33:21 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure those are apartment style dorms with private bedrooms. On your housing assignment does it say Nike 104-(room number) followed by A,B,C, or D? Or just your room number followed by A1, A2, B1, or B2?"
ucf,39808d,Michigesseo,1 point,Wed Jun 10 16:43:46 2015 UTC,"Its the room number followed by A,B,C, D"
ucf,39808d,Michigesseo,1 point,Wed Jun 10 20:40:50 2015 UTC,"Yeah, apartment style 4 bed 2 bath dorms"
ucf,3946x3,datlaurel,8,Tue Jun 9 03:25:27 2015 UTC,"She still teaches and she is still not good at it. A few friends had her for Topics, which is the easiest course to teach ever, and she apparently was poor at that too.  Back when this started Dr. Leavens posted a link in the UCF CS Facebook group to an online racial bias test and essentially implied that the reason some people had a problem with her was because of mental bias against her race. This seemed dismissive of him and understandably annoyed students. Perhaps he didn't mean it that way but it sure looked like it.  From what I heard, she was definitely quite rude at times and making mistakes in class, but there were also some students that were jumping on the Hate Elva bandwagon which complicated some things at the time."
ucf,3946x3,DaffUCF,2,Tue Jun 9 05:24:38 2015 UTC,What link did he post?  I never saw a post from him about her
ucf,3946x3,antigravcorgi,2,Tue Jun 9 14:39:35 2015 UTC,I'd need to go through the group to see it again but I think it was from Harvard.
ucf,3946x3,DaffUCF,2,Tue Jun 9 16:38:19 2015 UTC,"So I've no idea what you're talking about, but she teaches a class right before one of mine, so she's still at UCF."
ucf,3946x3,GoosedSpruce,2,Tue Jun 9 05:20:07 2015 UTC,Type her name in the search bar of this subreddit. You won't be disappointed.
ucf,3946x3,GoosedSpruce,3,Tue Jun 9 11:50:42 2015 UTC,"Wow I had heard she was a mediocre at best professor from friends, but damn. Well I know who to avoid now at least."
ucf,3946x3,lumalav666,2,Tue Jun 9 13:55:08 2015 UTC,She's teaching Operating Systems right now.
ucf,3946x3,kelifson,2,Tue Jun 9 11:15:40 2015 UTC,I feel bad for the new students having to deal with her. I've heard just how bad it is in her classes. Read excellent CS books in the meantime until you get good professors!
ucf,3946x3,sm1t1c0,1 point,Tue Jun 9 16:18:53 2015 UTC,I have a class with her right now. Is there anything I should know about her? I mean other than she's a horrible professor. This is my first semester at UCF and kinda not enjoying it.
ucf,3946x3,ThinBraStraps,2,Tue Jun 9 15:51:11 2015 UTC,"Look up her name in this sub's search box, other people who had her give detailed accounts."
ucf,3946x3,Brogramr,1 point,Tue Jun 9 16:34:01 2015 UTC,Yeah she's still here. I had her for a database class last semester and it was pretty good.
ucf,3946x3,the_god_damn_batman,0,Tue Jun 9 20:01:49 2015 UTC,"Really? I tried taking databases with her Fall 2014, the year with the disaster of her teaching and i had to drop the course, she was a terrible teacher. Too bad they didn't show her the fucking door"
ucf,392aeo,orlandonewsinformer,78,Mon Jun 8 19:03:26 2015 UTC,"Say what you want about what you think he does or doesn't deserve, but he is one of the longest standing university presidents in the country, has had ample opportunities to go to other institutions, but has stayed at UCF since he arrived in 1992 and has turned it from a little central Florida no-name school into a respected institution academically, geographically and even athletically. UCF owes him a huge debt and he can be personally credited with making our school what it is today and what we all know it will someday be.   Of all the stupid things tuition dollars get pissed away on, President Hitt is probably one of the most worthwhile investments and assets we've ever had and I have no problem with how much we pay him. He loves UCF and I hope he stays with us through out the remainder of his career."
ucf,392aeo,Buttercup_Barantheon,7,Mon Jun 8 19:37:27 2015 UTC,"You get what you pay for. I hate how much I pay and the fact that UCF pisses away a lot of money whiley department is still sort of broke, but Hitt deserves it for his expansion of the school and investment of things like Nona."
ucf,392aeo,NickDerpkins,27,Mon Jun 8 19:43:58 2015 UTC,I moved down here from the Midwest... I don't think you realize just how cheap school in Florida is. It's a damn bargain compared to other states.
ucf,392aeo,Ketamine_,8,Tue Jun 9 00:49:12 2015 UTC,I agree. I lived in Pennsylvania and (in-state) tuition for PSU is 3-5x what I pay for UCF
ucf,392aeo,Dr_Not_A_Doctor,13,Tue Jun 9 02:00:11 2015 UTC,"Ohio State:  $10,037 for residents  UCF: $5,095 for residents"
ucf,392aeo,Ketamine_,3,Tue Jun 9 02:04:57 2015 UTC,"yeah i'm reading this thinking wtf..  I work in the financial aid office, it's crazy watching kids come in their senior year of college basically crying because they have to take out their first subsidized loan for their last semester and its only like $1750...I pay out of state and my tuition is cheaper than most NJ school instate tuition."
ucf,392aeo,RyanSheckler,4,Tue Jun 9 14:45:37 2015 UTC,"As an alumni of 2 different schools, the tutiton at UCF is CRAZY cheap.   You should be happy with how LITTLE you pay in comparasion to other schools in the nation.   12 credits at UCF for residents = $2,547.36  Full time at PITT for residents = $16,872"
ucf,392aeo,Hard_Time_EXTREME,1 point,Tue Jun 9 11:35:37 2015 UTC,UCF Faculty says otherwise.
ucf,392aeo,habeas_corpse,7,Tue Jun 9 03:32:04 2015 UTC,Would they ever actually be happy though?
ucf,392aeo,Buttercup_Barantheon,2,Tue Jun 9 05:05:42 2015 UTC,"I used to be faculty and my husband is currently a director of a major department at UCF. Depends on who you ask, I guess."
ucf,392aeo,UCF_Chris,-2,Tue Jun 9 11:06:05 2015 UTC,"Not to mention Judge Judy.. I mean Judy Genshaft makes the 13th highest salary in the COUNTRY, more than 112 student tuition I think and leads the state in highest paid President."
ucf,392aeo,Shadowex3,-2,Mon Jun 8 19:52:20 2015 UTC,"John Hitt has done fuck all to accomplish that, what he HAS done is turn UCF into a goddamn joke, be it ""U Can't Finish"" or worse, while getting himself and his top cronies rich at the same time he tells professors there's no money to pay them and departments struggle to fund their graduate students.  How much did he pay you to post this?"
ucf,392aeo,Buttercup_Barantheon,2,Thu Jun 11 13:21:32 2015 UTC,"So you're saying the institution he took over in 1992 was something promising and he ruined it? Yeah, right. It's a shame that departments don't get the funding they really should have but that isn't Hitt's direct fault or impact, nor is it remotely a problem exclusive to UCF, it's across the board at all state schools. He is, however, responsible for our medical school, our football stadium, our arena, getting us into bigger sports conferences, playing major teams on prime time TV, which even if you don't care about has contributed to more than doubling our student body over less than a decade (which does in fact bring dollars to departments), and now the expansion of the downtown campus among with a slew of other accomplishments that have risen the quality and prestige of our institution in indispensable ways.   What so many people, including professors, don't realize is that university administration is 100% a form of politics. Things don't get done or accomplished without some elbow rubbing and deal making. It's the same in departments too and, while I don't think it's fair, the employees who get everything from tenure to funding are more times than not people who have figured out the political side of it and learned to play the game. I don't think this is an ideal system but it's been that way for eons and is definitely not something you can pin on president Hitt."
ucf,392aeo,skwigger,16,Thu Jun 11 18:09:11 2015 UTC,"So, only 100 students and Hitt's salary is paid. There's still 50k+ students' tuition for everything else."
ucf,392aeo,ghillisuit95,14,Tue Jun 9 09:01:07 2015 UTC,and?
ucf,392aeo,Long_Drive,26,Mon Jun 8 23:35:29 2015 UTC,The University of Central Florida recently announced that it would not raise tuition for the upcoming 2015-16 academic year.
ucf,392aeo,Ticks,9,Mon Jun 8 19:48:56 2015 UTC,"This has got to be the stupidest measure I've seen. How much Hitt makes and how much we pay are not all that related. If he made twice as much as tuition, but tuition was ~$250,000 (more than any other school, but just to prove a point) vs the like ~$5000 it is now, I think everyone would be hell of a lot more upset.  There are significantly worse things we piss money away on that isn't President Hitt's salary. Like the salary of everyone who works in ASF and OSI."
ucf,392aeo,mikesicle,8,Tue Jun 9 05:07:13 2015 UTC,Good for him.

ucf,392aeo,nobodytrickedme,11,Tue Jun 9 04:41:45 2015 UTC,I think George O Leary's salary is ridiculous. I'd feel a lot worse about it if that money came from Tuition and fees. Not one penny of student money goes to his salary.

ucf,392aeo,Lauxman,2,Tue Jun 9 03:58:07 2015 UTC,Sounds like you should attend a different institution if you have such a huge problem with it.

ucf,392aeo,BobbaGanush87,2,Tue Jun 9 13:57:01 2015 UTC,How did he get the position through lies and deceit?  I know he lied about some credentials when going for the Notre Dame coaching job but I thought he joined UCF after all that.
ucf,392aeo,BobbaGanush87,3,Tue Jun 9 14:07:22 2015 UTC,"But I don't think you can say he got the UCF job by lying.  UCF knew about his lying past and decided to give him a shot.  If he lied to UCF then I would say he lied to get the job but everyone, including UCF, knew everything before hand.  You're right it doesn't go away, which is why he got the coaching job for UCF which doesn't have a stellar football program compared to other Division 1 schools."

ucf,38zhv7,Valese18,3,Tue Jun 9 00:44:39 2015 UTC,"If you're over 18(or 18) it won't be too terrible to get the license, honestly would just grab a friend(who is good at driving) and go to an empty parking lot and just practice three or four days a week until you're comfortable taking the final test at the DMV  Note at the DMV you'll need to already have access to the car you will be driving(I forget if you'll already need insurance then but might want to check that)  The test was extremely easy for me when I took it, I had been overthinking it. I myself would only take classes for confidence in driving, but since you seem to be a little nervous definitely practice mroe if you have the availability of it - for classes I have 0 idea(sorry if OT)"
ucf,38zhv7,steelsoldat,2,Mon Jun 8 04:41:13 2015 UTC,"I'm definitely over 18 and am kind of embarrassed about this (hence the horribly named throwaway).  I've asked a couple of friends, but they are hesitant letting me use their cars even in parking lots (they can't find a lot empty enough, cars are in their parent's names and don't want anyone else driving it, car is fairly new, etc).  It's hard when everyone's nagging you to get a license and yet no one seems willing to help, so a school seems to be the only option at this point.  I actually took driver's ed in high school, but the teacher and classmates made fun of me so much I actually dreaded my lessons and failed the test.  I wasn't particularly bad and I never hit anything, but I had almost no experience behind the wheel at the time, and the people in my class had been driving for a while and were very comfortable.  Honestly, my main concerns are parking and the three point turn (that's what made me fail last time I took the test).  I literally parked once or twice in Driver's Ed, it was mostly GET IN THE CAR AND GET ON THE ROAD!  I swear I'm not like Tina haha."
ucf,38zhv7,steelsoldat,1 point,Mon Jun 8 05:34:07 2015 UTC,"It's terrible, but I most certainly WOULD NOT practice on UCF, with all of the people in the parking garages, those are a nightmare considering I recently switched from a jeep wrangler to a camaro, which is much longer.  Honest question(not meaning to bash you or anything) but would you have the means to get a vehicle if you get a license? Honest question that brings up whether or not it's actually worth it. I realize socially it's embarrassing, but  I personally mooch off other people for rides whenever I can unless it's something formalish(interview etc). Don't ave to worry about wear and tear on car or gas if I'm not the one who is driving.  tl;dr: Just think about if you really have a need to drive or just want the license because everyone else has one. Just because everyone else has one only means in the long term (if you can get rides) then you save money imo."
ucf,38zhv7,interrobang__,3,Tue Jun 9 00:12:09 2015 UTC,"Honestly, there's no reason to be embarrassed. I got my permit at 15 and didn't get my license until I was 19. And by that I mean I literally did not learn to drive until I was 19 years old. It's worth trying local elementary/middle/high school parking lots over the weekends- they're likely to be barren, especially given that it's summer break.  I'd just keep asking around to your friends. I can't foresee driving school being that helpful if you already know the basics of driving and just need to get more comfortable behind the wheel."
ucf,38zhv7,ajs2294,1 point,Mon Jun 8 15:29:59 2015 UTC,"Driving school is more so that I actually have a car someone will let me practice with, haha, as well as a car for the test.  I'm at the age where I very well should have a license by now, so if I can build up confidence during consistent practice during Summer B, I should be able to get it in August."
ucf,38zhv7,GoosedSpruce,2,Mon Jun 8 15:39:18 2015 UTC,"100% honest the way I originally learned to drive was driving around an empty parking lot in my moms car. With my mom there of course. I remember I was extremely nervous and it took several trips to quiet the nerves but it was extremely worth it. I learned all the fundamentals without the pressure of being on the road. I'm sure someone you know would allow you to drive around an empty parking lot with them. Hell drivers ed in high school thats all you do.  Build confidence and then slowly move onto the road. To be completely honest the only thing you will really learn at the very beginning is how to not be a complete mess and hit cars. Learning to become a ""skillful"" driver takes driving on real roads with real ""idiot"" drivers for years. You learn how to anticipate and react while hopefully making it home without a scratch."
ucf,38zhv7,datlaurel,1 point,Wed Jun 10 06:11:09 2015 UTC,"Don't do it man. Driver's school that is. It's going to be hundreds of dollars to get anything worth while, and from my experience with people who've done it, it just makes them more nervous.  Do you know anyone with a car? Bribe them with beer. Hell, if I didn't drive a manual I'd consider helping if you wanted to float me money for fuel and lunch. I promise you the Florida drivers practical is way more about calmly driving than anything crazy difficult, and that's coming from someone who took it at 19 after a year at university where I did no driving, and only sporadic at best road time while I was in high school. Plus, the first time I did highway driving I blew out two tires, and that really shook my confidence for years. I passed with flying colors.  Get someone to take you to the top floor of a garage on a weekend, practice until you're comfortable, but most of all once you've got any hang on it realize that the most important part is just calmly driving."

It's not like I said, ""Hey, let's go for a ride down Alafaya!""  but apparently a lot of people's parents got their cars for them and they simply don't want anyone else behind the wheel.  Which is understandable.  I'm not thrilled about driving school, but it looks to be my only option at this point.  At the very least, I KNOW that I'm capable of driving, I just need some practice - consistent practice.

ucf,38x4ld,thatucfguy,9,Sun Jun 7 16:16:26 2015 UTC,"I think that saying ""computer science is programming"" or implying that computer engineering is not programming is a little misleading.  Even if you're an electrical engineer, the chances that the job you get is going to be primarily programming is high.  The 3 majors have a lot of overlap and interaction.    Computer science focuses more on data manipulation.  Algorithms, structure, manipulation, etc.  Basically, how to make the computer efficiently do things.  It is the most programming heavy, but also contains a lot of theory on the related subjects.  Computer engineering focuses more on interactions between hardware that make up a computer system.  Its not just about the processing itself, but also about the senors, the peripherals, etc.  Because of this, you're trading a lot of the algorithm and theory classes for electronics classes.  You will also do HDL programming (hardware descriptive languages), which are programming languages that compile into hardware designs for microchips."
ucf,38x4ld,akukame,3,Sun Jun 7 19:18:59 2015 UTC,"Similarly, CS is more abstract maths (Discrete, for instance) and CE is more physical maths (requiring Calc 3 and DE)."
ucf,38x4ld,Jwkicklighter,2,Mon Jun 8 00:31:25 2015 UTC,"Computer engineering actually gets the best of both worlds.  They do have to take discrete, calc 3, and diff eq.

They will typically make an exception if your GPA is a little low, or your GMAT is a little low, or if you're close to three years (I also worked at the EDC so I know the people that administer it). However, when I went back, I was 27 and I think the third or so youngest person in the class (of 33 people). Loved the style of the program and the majority of the professors. I would recommend a cohort style program over a typical MBA program though, and I definitely recommend waiting for an MBA that requires job experience over one that doesn't. You'll get more out of your cohort when they're experienced professionals rather than when they're right out of undergrad with no experience."

The site also mentions that the GMAT is not required, but what was your experience with it at the EDC? Do you know what GMAT score is considered competitive for the UCF MBA programs?  A cohort-style program sounds brilliant; however, I'm interested in taking advantage of tuition reimbursement at my current workplace and enrolling into grad school as soon as possible. Do you think I would have a fair shot at the Evening track? The curriculum requests a ""Résumé showing a minimum of 2 years of full-time equivalent work experience,"" which I don't exactly meet, but I figure that it's worth a shot anyhow!"
ucf,38lhkn,stylo__,1 point,Fri Jun 5 01:49:03 2015 UTC,"I took the GRE and the GMAT, my GRE score was a bit higher than the GMAT equivalence. I can't remember the GRE score, but I'm pretty sure the GMAT score they were looking for was around 540. I think I got a 530 (or right there below the 540) and thats why i went with the other.  I completely understand your circumstance, and like I said, they will make exceptions. The biggest part of the application process is the interview. You have to interview to get into the program. Even though I was working there at the time, the director (Dr. Michaels) grilled me on my undergraduate performance. I got two D's in accounting and he wanted to know why I felt that I deserved to be in the program.  My undergrad GPA was what held me back, as I struggled to get my GPA back up after a first couple of years (I never had to study in high school or do homework and got straight As so I had no decent study habits or accountability). However, the interview went well and I was accepted.  Its worth applying and at least interviewing, because that will be the biggest impact. If the current class enrollment is a little on the lower end, and you interview well, you could have a shot :)"

We moved in almost a week before classes in the fall and spent a few days having movie marathons and such. There were various events going on around campus for students. Not sure if summer is the same, but I would think there is stuff to do."
ucf,38me80,Natalyc,2,Fri Jun 5 03:50:42 2015 UTC,"First of all, make sure you're checking the right financial aid year.  You should be checking 2014-2015, NOT 2015-2016.  Checking the right year and aid is still gone?  Contact them as soon as possible, via phone or via email to get this sorted out.  My Summer B financial aid is still listed on myUCF, and if it wasn't, I'd want to know why immediately.   Do you have any holds or things on your to-do list?  Did you not meet Satisfactory Academic Progress?"
ucf,38me80,Valese18,1 point,Fri Jun 5 19:32:22 2015 UTC,Office of Student Financial Aid does this frequently. They'll usually put it back into your account eventually. I wouldn't really worry about it but give them a call if it'll give you some peace of mind.
ucf,38mch9,Natalyc,8,Fri Jun 5 03:37:57 2015 UTC,"Depends on your definition of ""really big.""  For example, I will fetch for you a sample of intro versus those more advanced from the catalog for Fall 2015:   Intro to C: 200 Computer Science I: 200 Object Oriented Programming: 250   They usually have an average of 225. Usually held in the 101 of buildings (the biggest, central lecture hall, the one with about 250 seats)  But I think it's fair to say that introductory courses are bigger. They always are if a large number of people need them. Your preference would really only come down to professor here, honestly.  And then those past the almighty gate of the Foundation Exam (according to the degree audit, anyway):   Discrete Structures II: 90 Operating Systems: 150 Programming Languages I: 125   I would say the average here is about 95, honestly. Much better than the 225 average of the intro courses! They're usually held in the smaller rooms, anywhere from 100 - 150 seats. Specialized classes are a total guess, I can't say much about them.   Given this, as far as student to professor ratio is concerned, there's a few options. In many cases the professor has multiple classes, maybe even with a few sessions of each of them, always with upwards of 500 students. TAs for advanced classes variate crazily, especially for traditionally harder classes, so I'll give a rough guess for them.   If you count TAs in this:     Intro: (1 prof + about 4 TAs) 1:45 Advanced: (1 prof + about 2 TAs) 1:30   It should also be noted I'm talking about class capacities, not actual enrollment. There's no way to predict exactly how full the class will actually be, especially in Summer or if there's a few sessions of it.   TLDR; Intro is 225 (1:45), advanced is 95 (1:30). Take that as you will."
ucf,38mch9,the_Cosmic_Bard,3,Fri Jun 5 06:22:01 2015 UTC,I think with the large expansion of staff that is happening (something like an additional 100 are being brought in) the Comp Sci shouldn't be so bad anymore. I'm just fortunate that not many take my major so class size isn't really an issue.
ucf,38mch9,CallMeFierce,2,Fri Jun 5 12:45:36 2015 UTC,"In all honesty those ratios aren't terrible (to me, at least). The additional staff will help, and I considered noting that, but since I'm not sure how many of that would be actual professors for these classes, I decided to leave it out."
ucf,38mch9,the_Cosmic_Bard,3,Fri Jun 5 14:19:45 2015 UTC,"I think 1:30 is pretty good, but the pre-foundations ratio kind of sucks. Definitely good idea to leave out the additional staff, I don't know how many are professors either."
ucf,38mch9,CallMeFierce,3,Fri Jun 5 14:21:56 2015 UTC,"All of my classes so far have been about 250-300 people lecture halls, with the exception of CDA3101 this summer, which has 80 seats, but I swear only half the class max shows up.  I suspect it's hinting at the post foundation exam classes though, which I can only assume will be smaller, due to the low pass rate of the exam."
ucf,38mch9,GoosedSpruce,3,Fri Jun 5 06:21:13 2015 UTC,"early ones are 200 something people. sometimes more.  as you progress they drop down to 100 or so.  by the end you are in 50-80 people classes, or 15-20 if they are early in the morning (<10am).  all of the large classes have tutoring that is free to go to. with all that being said, if you go to your CS classes thinking you will learn CS, your wrong. you have to teach your self stuff on your own outside of class!

When I took trig I skipped the MALL hour requirement even though it was 5% of of the grade. Got a B and it was totally worth it.
ucf,38lh7l,Diz-Rittle,2,Fri Jun 5 00:10:44 2015 UTC,"I think MALL hours counted as a larger percentage for my Precalc class last fall, so be careful. Also don't procrastinate on getting them done because sometimes the MALL lab gets full and you can't get in to get them done on time.  I think you would only have to do them for trig.

For one, it doesn't hurt, and second, you can prove you bought the new decal and did not have time to put it on beforehand (I would stress that point).  To give you hope, I had one (and my only ever) parking ticket at UCF and had it successfully appealed which just took writing the appeal.  Before Tower II had temp parking at the side (this was the second year it was open I believe) I was moving in, flew in from out of state, and had no where else to park since I did not have the decal.  I got a ticket, and appealed it as to the fact that there was literally no where else I could park save for the other side of campus (sort of).  At any rate, I had it successfully appealed.    Now on the contrary, I had a roommate who was in your situation, but received two tickets within hours of eachother the same day.  He then moved his car to my friends place off campus, and it got towed since he parked in the visitors lot (but not in a visitors spot as we found out the next day).  At any rate, he never appealed and paid both tickets.  I highly suggest you do not do nothing.  At any rate, good luck in your appeal!"

ucf,38c2ff,Moxormog,2,Wed Jun 3 12:42:00 2015 UTC,"In my experience, people have claimed Calculus was several orders of magnitude more difficult than it actually was. It certainly can be tough, if you do not practice the problems and see how the mechanics of Calculus work.   In short, to succeed in Calc:  *Do all of your assigned homework--more, even, if you find yourself struggling. You are learning new concepts, and in order for those concepts to really sink in, you have to practice them! You presumably did many many multiplication and division problems when you were first starting your math career, so a similar approach to calc should yield similar results.  *If a certain topic is giving you trouble, Khan Academy works wonders. I went on vacation the semester I took calc and missed a weeks worth of lectures, but I managed to get in a couple hours on Khan Academy and felt like I hadn't missed anything!  *Seriously, do the homework!

My suggestion would be, take notes for every little detail in your own words, if there is something you didn't understand just mark it and ask the professor in office times also download the eText the book your professor is using along with it's solution manual or check out slader.com for the solutions and work your ass off"

It forced you to do massive amounts of problems and could somewhat help you understand the problems you miss.  However, the software conditions you for those tests, but in Calc, everything is handwritten. You're going to need to prove all your work and also use correct notations and vocabulary.  It honestly is at least a magnitude in difficulty. The concepts weren't hard, but I miss the mass amounts of homework. Doing every assignment and practice test wasn't enough for ME to get an A."

You're meant to scratch your head on it until you figure it out; Use it as practice for your exams.  3) Know that there's a difference between ""knowing how to solve a problem using calculus"" and ""remembering the material."" Calculus builds on itself, just like any other math course, and Algebra is a major component of it. In order to solve applied calculus problems, you have to know how concepts can relate to each other, and how to use a combination of different mathematical techniques to solve a problem (Like finding the minimum surface area for a given volume, or finding the average value of a function).

Still, as someone who shipped thousands of books on Amazon, and has gotten the worried ""WHY IS MY BOOK GOING TO TAKE A MONTH!?!?!?!?!?!?"" email way too often, I can assure you that it's just Amazon setting the expectation bar as low as possible. If you're really worried send an email through Amazon, but that's up to you.  Also, that book is locally available at CB&S for ~$18 to rent. And it's ~$13 on campus. If you're desperate, CB&S will price match+10% off if you show them campus has it for cheaper. You can then just return the book you got online. It looks like you probably got it for ~8, so it's $4ish more, but might be worth it if you're concerned about getting it fast enough."

ucf,388805,DrDeezNuttz,6,Tue Jun 2 17:40:53 2015 UTC,no problem! he works harder than any teacher I know to make sure his students know the material. he stays hours after class and even comes in on the weekend if you need the extra help. he wasn't an easy A but it wasn't terribly hard either.
ucf,388805,DrDeezNuttz,1 point,Tue Jun 2 18:17:24 2015 UTC,"and as for the experience thing you'll be okay without any prior knowledge, he starts with a simple ""hello world"" print function"

He is a bit challenging, but super helpful. He will spend a great amount of time helping students out of class and studying with them. I have only been at UCF two semesters, but so far he has been my favorite professor."
ucf,388805,RenegadeMizu,3,Tue Jun 2 22:25:55 2015 UTC,"I talked with Guha a few weeks ago about Honors C and he more than likely won't be teaching it sadly. I'm pretty sure both Honors and Regular are meant with those with no experience. I'm picking honors regardless of who's teaching it. If you're hard working like you said, I say you should do the same."
ucf,388805,RenegadeMizu,1 point,Tue Jun 2 15:36:53 2015 UTC,"It's disappointing to hear he may not be teaching Honors C!  Did he say he was teaching another Intro to C course?  He's listed as a definite for Honors on the course catalog search and as ""TBA"" for Regular.  Since you're picking Honors regardless, do you have prior programming experience?  What year are you?"
ucf,388805,RenegadeMizu,1 point,Tue Jun 2 15:41:26 2015 UTC,"I don't think so. He told me that he had originally signed up to teach Honors C but decided to teach CompSci I instead.   I do have programming experience, but that's only part of the reason that I'm doing honors for it. And I'm the same year as you, I'll be a freshman in the fall."

ucf,388805,martinatime,6,Tue Jun 2 16:15:42 2015 UTC,"Well the easiest class to take would be with professor Angell. If you want more of a challenge, take it with Lobo or Guha."
ucf,388805,Andrew288,2,Tue Jun 2 19:42:27 2015 UTC,Avoid Elva at all costs. Arup Guha was da bees knees.  Be careful of UCF switching which teacher will teach the class.  They will put a highly respected teacher as a place holder then switch it out last minute.
ucf,388805,cowpace,1 point,Wed Jun 3 01:34:39 2015 UTC,"Here are my 2 cents as a UCF Computer Science Grad (c/o '99). I took many programming courses there and with all of them you can probably learn most everything outside of the classroom as far as the syntax. The concepts such as data structures and algorithms can be a little more tricky for coding novices. My recommendation is to get a book on C and study it before the fall. Don't try to get into anything related to windowed applications or GUI's as that'll get you really into the weeds and may be discouraging. And with C work your way up to the point where you understand pointers and references as they are probably some of the most difficult concepts for new programmers.  As far as professors, I only recall Lobo that I had for probably 6 different classes during my time at UCF. He could be a pain in the ass sometimes but that made him a great educator as he made sure that his students knew the material. Guha might have been there while I was there but I don't remember and the other two I only recognize from email newsletters or what not over the last 15 years.  Good Luck and Happy Coding!"
ucf,388805,bk10287,1 point,Tue Jun 2 20:42:26 2015 UTC,"I took it a couple years ago with Angell. You say that you will take time to succeed, so I don't think you'll have any problem with her class. She's not super difficult unless you have an especially hard time understanding how code works."
ucf,388805,Takuya813,1 point,Tue Jun 2 21:47:58 2015 UTC,"Gonzalez isn't a bad pick. I hear he lectures well however is hard to find due to being one of the top researchers at UCF  Do not take angel with no prior programming experience. You will fail the Foundation Exam if you do.  I had lobo for robot vision and he's a nice guy, and his homeworks and tests are up to par. A good pick, but..  Honestly Guha is a better choice over all others IMO simply because you will probably take guha more than once, so it's better to make a good first impression and for you to see what Arup is like. That and he's been teaching intro to C for 21 semesters (or 23? someone who remembers his discrete 2 speech will know) so he knows his shit and knows the common pitfalls for students  This is an important class. Take the first homework seriously and don't look for the answer on the Internet."
ucf,38927n,paparufi2,1 point,Tue Jun 2 18:18:34 2015 UTC,You can not play after you have graduated.   You need a student ID to play and if you're caught using someone else's ID that person will have to go to student conduct not sure about you since you've already graduated.
ucf,38927n,TimelessVENOM,0,Tue Jun 2 18:47:56 2015 UTC,"Did you or a friend get caught or something? Because I would always be at the softball fields during games. All the RCW employee did was make sure the ID the person gave her, and the name on her roster list was correct. She didn't look at people to make sure they were that person.   I was also going to use my friends ID and we look very very similar."
ucf,38927n,TimelessVENOM,2,Tue Jun 2 18:56:19 2015 UTC,I had a friend get caught. You may not think they look at ID and the person giving it but they do.   It's not going to be worth possibly you and your friend getting in trouble IMO.
ucf,38927n,ucfrwc,7,Tue Jun 2 19:08:24 2015 UTC,"Good advice. You certainly can no longer play after you've graduated. We recommend the good people over at the Orlando Sport & Social Club if you're looking for a league to play in locally.  As for OP, we catch people all the time using someone else's ID. You risk getting them suspended as well - not just from the RWC but in some hot water with student conduct.   Plus you'd be easier to catch now that we know who you are :)"

ucf,38625x,mmelli,12,Tue Jun 2 03:16:59 2015 UTC,yeah... no. USF is our rival.

ucf,38625x,bonersaurus-rex,6,Tue Jun 2 03:33:14 2015 UTC,"They're just forcing it at this point. Let it come up organically, don't make a trophy without the other team knowing."
ucf,38625x,fozziefreakingbear,1 point,Tue Jun 2 03:34:34 2015 UTC,"While it is forced, how else should it start? If I remember correctly, they brought the idea of the game and trophy up shortly after the game last year.  USF won't even acknowledge our rivalry, so if this chaps their ass even a little I think it's great."
ucf,38625x,bonersaurus-rex,5,Tue Jun 2 11:43:37 2015 UTC,"They also coincidentally left off our first game's score from the trophy.  And even if USF doesn't want to acknowledge it, every USF fan I know does, as does the rest of the sports world. Their administration is just a little behind on things. Can't say I'm surprised, it is USF. ;)"
ucf,38625x,-eltopo,3,Tue Jun 2 13:17:08 2015 UTC,"I think the reasoning behind leaving the old score off (which is hilarious), is because this is the new coach. Pretty ticky tack on their part.  I wish USF (the school) would embrace the rivalry. It could be one for the ages."
ucf,38625x,bonersaurus-rex,7,Tue Jun 2 14:06:55 2015 UTC,"Still, kinda shitty on them. We've had 2 games to somehow start a rivalry (what?), and they only choose to put one of those games on the rivalry trophy. Seems logical.  And I mean whenever we play USF it's during rivalry week soooo I feel like they're just not officially acknowledging it. The fans know it's a rivalry, who cares if the administration won't officially acknowledge it?"
ucf,38625x,-eltopo,3,Tue Jun 2 14:18:13 2015 UTC,"Do you feel like UConn is your rival or do you feel like it's USF? So what if USF doesn't acknowledge it, almost everyone else does. You don't need the administration to tell you who your rival is, the fans and players figure it out themselves.   A rivalry should start in its own without being manufactured. Do I care about UConn? Hell no, this whole thing is just forced."
ucf,38625x,fozziefreakingbear,4,Tue Jun 2 13:59:35 2015 UTC,"Of course I feel like USF is a bigger rival. I hate everything about that school....but in recent years, they have turned their nose up towards us, saying that it isn't a rivalry and they don't want to treat it that way. Players, coaches, fans, etc. I don't want to have a rivalry with people who have an attitude like that. USF didn't want to name the game, and even when UCF came up with the ""War on I-4,"" they never embraced it. Fuck those guys.  I want USF to hate UCF, and visa versa.  That would be a great rivalry, but if UConn wants to start an annual game with us, I think we should welcome it with open arms."
ucf,38625x,bonersaurus-rex,8,Tue Jun 2 14:28:33 2015 UTC,"But, they suck. Might as well start a rivalry with a local high school team."

ucf,388le3,UCFKnightTime,4,Tue Jun 2 16:50:08 2015 UTC,"My only recommendation is that you should take CS1 and Discrete at the same time. Both courses are needed for the FE and both courses need to be recently learned.  So, take both on Spring. Avoid calculus for now. You need to focus on the FE. Take these two and any other easy course that you might want to take.  Also don't take computer organization on Spring. You need easy courses. Security in computing is fine for instance. This is the way to succeed on the FE."
ucf,388le3,lumalav666,1 point,Tue Jun 2 16:54:01 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the feedback!  I was saying computer organization in Spring because that's what's suggested, but maybe I will substitute security in computing.  Did you take the FE recently?"

That's why you need to study and be well prepared for it at the end of next Spring."
ucf,388le3,lumalav666,1 point,Tue Jun 2 17:18:47 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I read about the crazy hard discrete section on the last exam.  Which professors did you have for Intro to C, CS1, and Discrete?

If you get accepted at UCF, you declare a major and take classes to complete that major.  However with CompSci, there's a wall you have to get past called the Foundation Exam. You will need to pass it to take upper level computer courses.  The FE isn't really the make or break point for a lot of potential CS students, it's the math. The math required is similar to an engineering degree."

I would just apply for housing as soon as you can. If you get assigned somewhere you don't like, try calling housing and asking if they have other openings."
ucf,37yv4g,bella_calabrone,2,Sun May 31 21:14:54 2015 UTC,"Hi. I was accepted as a transfer for this Fall.   APPLY FOR HOUSING AS SOON AS YOU CAN AFTER ACCEPTANCE. Don't get screwed like I did and was only left with the Rosen College dorm which is a whopping 40-45 minute commute. (Does provide free UCF shuttle).  You're applying in the Spring though, shouldn't be as brutal as Fall.  If you don't get a dorm you can be placed on the standby list.   Two off campus apartments in particular, Knights Circle and Pointe at Central are reasonable options and are UCF affiliated housing. Even cheaper than dorms if you cant get one.  Both will work with your financial aid and from what I'm told will defer payment until you receive a disbursement. But its a lease. Do not sign unless you're absolutely sure you can't get a dorm. Also, like UCF dorms they have UCF hired R.A. and ONLY students can stay at these apartments like all UCF affiliate housing.  Also, both are VERY close to UCF and even have a free UCF shuttle to and from the campus that runs every 15 mins from 7 am - 7 pm. There are other UCF affiliate housing too."

Watching videos on the problem you struggle on is the nect best thing to that. Also, just download and read the ebook if you havent. all physics 1 is is understanding your unit circle and basic trig and then using that to do summation of forces. Other than that just know your kinematic equations. I took physics for engineers and got a high A without much effort."

However, ucf is bigger, the campus is newer, and Orlando just has so much to offer. Although our sports aren't at fsu level, tailgating and going to all of the games are so much fun.  My only advise, make sure you get involved!   Otherwise, the school is just too big and you will miss out on all the opportunities school involvement will bring you.   Good luck and go knights!"
ucf,37zv1f,bella_calabrone,2,Sun May 31 21:18:39 2015 UTC,How do you recommend I get involved? And thanks for the info!
ucf,37zv1f,bella_calabrone,1 point,Sun May 31 22:20:48 2015 UTC,"Depends on what you like to do. If you like sports you can sign up for intermurals through the Rec, or if you're good you can try out for the schools teams, you can rush a sorority/fraternity if you're sociable or wanna be more sociable. I think there used to be tons of fliers in the union (our kinda ""home base"" of the school) of upcoming events. Also the apartment complex I lived at had events at the pool all the time and you can meet people there (most of the apts or dorms will have events).   Those are just a few ways. Once you're there you seriously can't miss all the stuff that goes on. Hope this helps!"
ucf,37zr3x,biscuitsawce,3,Sun May 31 19:53:19 2015 UTC,I'm planning to take College Algebra at Valencia   I'm already working on my College algebra credit at another school   Not following you. Take the MPT immediately to avoid unnecessary classes. You can place immediately into Calc I if you do well on the MPT.
ucf,37zr3x,kelifson,2,Mon Jun 1 00:05:30 2015 UTC,"I did this, and I'm currently taking college algebra at Valencia. You need to take the math placement test so the UCF system has you registered as being allowed to go into MAC 1105 and exempting lower maths, because if you don't, the transient process won't let you enroll in that level class, since it'll think you haven't gotten credit for the intensive algebras.  The math placement test is online, and you need to do the practice test first on mymathlabs, get a 35% so you can take the real test. A 35% on the actual test (which is done in the testing center on specific days, see their site) will get you in the college algebra. Got in with 37%.  Take Allison Hammack at Valencia. She's awesome!"
ucf,37zr3x,datlaurel,1 point,Sun May 31 20:38:30 2015 UTC,Ohh thank you for the info! What if your SAT score is high enough to get you into college algebra without taking the Math placement?

ucf,37zpks,FaceNelson,1 point,Sun May 31 19:41:37 2015 UTC,They disburse money weekly.  It usually takes a few days after you accept the loan for it to be processed by the bank.  Then the banks only send money to the school once a week (usually Monday).
ucf,37xbk3,Natalyc,9,Sun May 31 04:27:09 2015 UTC,Renting would be the best legal way
ucf,37xbk3,bwiinn,3,Sun May 31 04:30:42 2015 UTC,I've found a ton used on Amazon for under $20 so always shop around first and look at the previous edition of the book. The bookstore is always the most expensive. Also search for and/or torrent the PDFs.
ucf,37xbk3,laurenannedaniel,1 point,Sun May 31 04:33:43 2015 UTC,Do you have to buy the textbooks before classes start? Or how soon do you have to have them after classes start?
ucf,37xbk3,arvinarvin,2,Sun May 31 04:40:48 2015 UTC,"For most classes I wouldn't buy or rent textbooks till, at the earliest, after the first day of class once the syllabus is handed out unless the prof tells you you absolutely need to have it for the first day (which isn't the case majority of the time). There'll be a book list on myucf when you register but most of the time it's inaccurate or you only need one of the listed books."
ucf,37xbk3,laurenannedaniel,1 point,Sun May 31 04:57:28 2015 UTC,"So normally the first week of class is ""syllabus week"" and you have a week or two (generally) to get the book if it's required. I really like to have the textbook so if I can I generally go ahead and get it. TLDR it's your choice usually! You'll get a feel for what you like to do once you start classes :)"
ucf,37xbk3,ThinBraStraps,1 point,Sun May 31 04:57:12 2015 UTC,At least wait until class starts before getting the book. Figure out if you need the book first. Check ratemyprofessor too.
ucf,37xbk3,GeneralPurpoise,2,Sun May 31 05:03:46 2015 UTC,"I second this. I've had a few professors tell me to NOT get the book unless you want it for a reference, otherwise the department required them to require a textbook.  As a side note, if you find anything is unclear in a textbook, I'd recommend getting another used book on the same subject. I did this for my calculus/physics classes in particular. You can usually find them on Amazon for a penny and $3.99 shipping or just google the subject + pdf. You might benefit from a different perspective or a breakdown to solutions."
ucf,37xbk3,GoosedSpruce,1 point,Sun May 31 20:51:16 2015 UTC,"Textbooks before classes depends on classes/major. Most classes have a ramp up time though. I'd say don't be concerned if you're STEM, do be concerned if you like/feel you need to get ahead and are a reading heavy major, English for example. If it's summer B you might want to get it early even for STEM, but that's a bit more on how well you handle fast classes.   I generally don't recommend getting them until after the first class meeting unless you really feel you need to get ahead. After that you can sort of feel out the class. Some classes you won't ever need to get it, despite it being listed as required. For example, depending on the professor Intro to C/CS1/OOP at UCF basically have superfluous books."
ucf,37xbk3,GoosedSpruce,3,Sun May 31 05:09:15 2015 UTC,"I used to work at an off campus bookstore. The cheapest ways aren't legal. If that doesn't matter to you some majors have a very easy time torrenting, or just generally online, pdfs; comp sci, bigger engineering courses/majors (mechanical will be easier than nuclear, for instance), some of the sciences, etc. Others are less lucky, though commonly they have cheaper books, just require lots of them. Think english, poli sci, history.  The cheapest way to legally obtain books is almost always to look for the cheapest price for a rental online from a business (like Amazon) and compare that to peer-to-peer sales (like Amazon sellers). If the rental is significantly cheaper than buying a used copy from a peer-to-peer source, find a local bookstore that has your books and price matches, because they almost always do price matching + something, like an extra x% off. Campus bookstore is unlikely to do this, though as I have experience with bookstores I've never gone to UCF's.  If the rental isn't significantly cheaper, it could be worth having less hassle and just buying from the peer-to-peer guys. Note, the reason I don't suggest peer-to-peer for price matching is almost no one matches them, as they're too easy to game.  However, UF, which I went to in the past, had books available in the library for short term rental for all the major entry level classes. Yes, it was tough to get them during major study times, but it wasn't impossible, and it did mean you could skip out on buying a book if you only really needed it for homework. So check if UCF does the same thing, as I honestly don't know. Additionally higher level classes used the books less and less, becoming more of a supplement than a requirement (for engineering classes, non-STEM will continue to require them because readings are more required). I don't know how UCF runs as intimately, my time in a bookstore was while at UF, but I suspect it won't be wildly different.  I know a lot about books/bookstores though, so if you have any questions, or need clarifications, feel free to ask."

ucf,37xbk3,GoosedSpruce,2,Sun May 31 06:05:57 2015 UTC,You might be surprised compsci does use textbooks very often. At the end of the day though it's still quite a fun subject!
ucf,37xbk3,motsu35,1 point,Mon Jun 1 05:30:38 2015 UTC,They arrive*
ucf,37xbk3,DeoxyriBROse,1 point,Sun May 31 06:06:42 2015 UTC,"Your dorm has a shipping address, though I'm not sure who with UCF you'd contact to get it. It's probably somewhere on your my ucf. You just use that when you place your order and yes, they'll be shipped to your dorm. Generally you have more of a return window (30 days versus first week of classes) when renting/buying online, but it's otherwise basically the same process, just shipped to you.   If you need something time sensitive though order early and stay on top of it. Especially from Amazon Sellers, they just get so swamped and aren't normally massive retailers like amazon themselves so have only so much manpower, so sometimes thing slip through the cracks during the initial back to school period.  For your major classes you'll be able to get 90% of the book information you'd need from googling anyways or for intro to C through the course website. It's CS, of course what we need is mostly online. And none of your gen eds should be too crazy, so you might be able to slip by fairly cheaply. Good luck."
ucf,37xbk3,estrellez,4,Sun May 31 06:24:19 2015 UTC,"1) dont buy them. 90% of the time you dont need them.  2) if you need them only for homework, take pictures / scan the pages you need from a class mate.  3) if you need it for homework (for learning, not just getting questions) you can try and googling a phrase from one of the chapters. normally a pdf / trial of the text book can be found.  4) worst case, look for the instructor edition, its normally cheaper... or rent"
ucf,37xbk3,BigPuffyBird,1 point,Sun May 31 07:03:45 2015 UTC,Can't say for other majors but on the Biomedical Sciences facebook group many students have shared PDFs of textbooks.
ucf,37xbk3,Zarrasis,1 point,Mon Jun 1 14:23:16 2015 UTC,"I usually look for older or international editions (digitally or physically online, NEVER in a textbook store although sometimes the library works) and just compare the table of contents with that of the book edition explicitly ""required"". Table of contents can be found online for just about any text book. Usually the only differences are swapped chapters and different problem numbers. If you have homework, you can just snap pics from classmates for the problems sections. It also doesn't hurt to ask around and see if anyone has a digital copy of the book, if you can't find it yourself. Worst case scenario, rent it."

ucf,37x0da,kamdaboss,1 point,Mon Jun 1 14:24:45 2015 UTC,"Recently bought one myself, lurked /r/longboarding for a week and found many threads about general cruising boards (look through their resources side tab and search old threads, tons of helpful stuff there), unless you find and lowball someone on craigslist or on the UCF Buy/Sell/Trade facebook group, you're looking around the range of $120 and up (sometimes still even if it's used). That or find someone nice enough to sell you one cheap  I couldn't justify that price for something I haven't tried before (and in honesty, could turn out I dont use it enough/dont like it enough) so I settled with this one from ebay. The seller has many items like this one; decent enough looking quality for the price. Should be here thursday, I'll try to remember and update with how it feels"
ucf,37x0da,DeoxyriBROse,2,Mon Jun 1 14:27:51 2015 UTC,Alright cool. Yeah I'm on the same boat as you. If I do use it then it will probably just be around campus. I was looking at does board on Ebay as well. Let me know how the quality is of the board that you bought. I was looking at this one on ebay
ucf,37x0da,DeoxyriBROse,1 point,Tue Jun 2 17:35:22 2015 UTC,"Came in early!  The board itself feels very durable, not cheap at all, decent ""flex"" to it (I believe this is a good thing for longboards; also im roughly 175-180lbs for reference). Trucks and wheels seems decent enough, the bearings seem the only thing that might be of poorer quality. All four wheels when spun seem to have a different feel to them/spin with more/less ease or time, so I'm tempted to just order a pair of Bones Reds through amazon if playing around with the screws doesnt work. Either that or try out Bones Red Speed Cream (heard very good things about it), both options are cheap (bearings are like $10, i think same for the cream).  Overall for the price, I'd say I'm very confident it's going to be a good first board for someone just looking for transport. Will update if anything happens in the next few days  (supposedly there was a company called Churchull that made really good boards for a low price, went under only a few months ago it seems though :( so close...)"
ucf,37x0da,DeoxyriBROse,1 point,Wed Jun 3 01:33:00 2015 UTC,"UPDATE: Alright so rode it for the first time on campus just now. I look like a moron but I couldn't care less, I just circled the whole campus in maybe 5min and its fun as hell.   So the wooden board itself feels pretty good, I definitely wouldn't have wanted to go anything under 36"" of foot space since I'm having trouble with foot placement.  Performance wise it's pretty good, trucks are a little tight and hard turns are difficult (though Idk if this is me or the board really). The bearings probably need either lube or just straight up replacement, either option is very cheap though (pushing wasn't too tough but my friends board seems to glide further with less of a push).  EDIT 1: Definitely try to loosen the trucks if turning is a little tight, helped a ton. Gonna try 3 in 1 lube (anything White Lithium) to grease the bearings next. Ok dont get random oils/greases, it'll probably be best to use these kinds of lubricants.   EDIT 2: Ok so i got home and took off the bearings, deciding to just replace them with bones red. The ones that came with the board have barely any spin (as in like 10-15sec of spin, whereas I've seen vids of BonesRed spin for greater than 3min when properly oiled and cleaned). Also you might need to get some extra washers, mine only came with 6 (two wheels were missing one). So overall, the board will probably end up being closer to $80ish when all is done, which is still pretty much the cheapest i could find anything (searched for used ones for 3 weeks, couldnt find anything I was looking for). This guy on youtube has some great vids about bearings, like how to clean them/replace them/etc.. if you need to."

Basically no high rises, but being so close to campus is nice (classroom building 1 and 2 are super close, which if you're new will be most of your lower level classes). Rents super high, and the RA's sometimes are sometimes not chill. Would recommend getting Jimmy Johns day old bread (its 50 cents). Do not get a meal plan unless you inhale food, its a rip off, again I can explain why if it applies to you. Make sure you hammer in your roommate agreement with some that seems trivial to you. This is because I had a roommate that was chill in the beginning and decently clean, then later on became a slob. The thing is the RA's can do very little to help you in that situation if it's not in your agreement. They always have events with lots of free food typically. Oh!!!! I'm about to do you a solid.

We have built in Publishing Controls for this, some automated, some manual, but you cant stop stupid.   Other people have compared it to Instagram also, difference is No App (so no data spying) & No Log in required, which is good for an event where people dont want to bother with an app, just text the pic. We also give the Host (bride & groom, or team coach, group leader) much more control than instagram."

Orlando has pretty solid data coverage because its a big city but not everywhere has a good enough 3/4G signal.

ucf,37r6c8,steelsoldat,1 point,Sat May 30 14:15:16 2015 UTC,"Yes, there is nothing we can do about that. However in that case, keep taking pics, then when you get out of the Arena, text them to the event's phone number. Similar limitation applies to apps, pics = data.   I have thought groups like the band, clubs, or greeks could have a private phone number, and only those members know and have permission to receive a link to the event's pics."

From the website and the first video I watched the pricing was already different which seems shady, to me the website could honestly be redesigned graphically, but isn't the end of the world.  I do currently work with many weddings and as stated below what would make this better than a free option for the price? Also if you are marketing to the brides at the weddings the ""even Planner"" name on the package might deter them as most people in weddings hire a planner separate from them to help them which would then be the one to buy this?(I guess?)  I'd honestly have to see it more in action before bashing it to see how it works and if it's worth(on my part, sorry if it's harsh) to market and endorse. I'll use the contact form in the website to drop my email and you can get back to me if you want to.

You won't be admitted into the program without this AS."

I ran a what if audit on it and the only requirement is that you show that you earned an A.S., not in something specific. And it says I meet all of the PRs for each class. Why do I feel like it's not fair that I get penalized for not going to community college...  I guess I'm trying too hard to find a loophole of sorts here but I feel like this isn't clear enough (like why include that last statement instead of just saying that you must have an AS in that particular thing...). Don't I (technically) have an AA or AS of some sort since I'm almost done with a 4 year degree? Ie. I feel like finishing the Gen Ed program here translates into an AA or AS, somebody told me that a while back, idk maybe that's wrong"

It's pretty clear in the catalog listing: ""Requirements for the track: An A.S. degree in Computer Programming and Analysis (CP&A), or at a minimum an A.S. degree and at least 3 programming courses (an intro and 2 courses in the same language in sequence) and a database course. ""  It's not supposed to viewed be a penalty -- the state colleges and UCF created this articulation agreement to ease the transfer of credits for these AS-BS/BAS students and to create a more cohesive curriculum for transfer students. Transfer articulations are a pretty big deal for the state; this is a good overview of what an articulation agreement is all about, but these degrees are for the benefit of those who participate in this agreement. Perhaps you should probably be more upset at the fact that there's no ""regular"" Software Development BS degree, but that's another discussion altogether.  There's also the fact that typically, a BAS degree is seen as a step lower than a BA or a BS degree. BAS tend to be highly specialized technical/vocational degrees.  Take the classes if you're interested in them. Do any of the classes fall nicely under an existing minor?"
