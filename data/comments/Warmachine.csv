Warmachine,3e4sbe,Needs_Improvement,1 point,Wed Jul 22 01:14:47 2015 UTC,I would be happy to help. I have a weird brain dysfunction where i check this reddit 8000 times a day. Might as well post something.
Warmachine,3e4sbe,OhhhSnooki,2,Wed Jul 22 03:35:34 2015 UTC,"Thanks!  Yeah, I'm kind of the same in how often I check :P  I have a possible idea for getting a post to engage more of the userbase at once, but I have to look at model counts to see if it's feasible.  Also the MOTD posts were more 3-4 times a week, which actually worked for reddits post visibility mechanics anyway, the frontpage typically still had 2-3 MOTD posts at a time.  So a model sunday, tuesday, and thursday nights would probably work best - on saturdays the sub activity is at it's lowest since people are actually out playing.    But yeah, I'll get a format together and try it a few times to see how well it goes over, but probably have to simplify.  Then maybe a voting system set up in trello, like what WMD has, to set up the rotation order."
Warmachine,3e4sbe,lolredditor,1 point,Wed Jul 22 04:21:09 2015 UTC,"As a novice player, I really loved MOTD. It was an insightful thread with many diverse opinions.  Thanks for all the work!  I'd really love to see it again someday."

I enjoyed doing it and wish I was the kind of dude who could keep something like this up for years on end; alas, my interests lead me where they do.  Link to the tracking spreadsheet: MOTD Tracking  The models that are on the sheet are the ones I've posted. There's not info on faction breakdown, but basically (counting Mercs as one faction and Minions as one faction) Cygnar, Legion, and Khador have 1 more model than everyone else, simply because that's where in the cycle I stopped posting.  EDIT: I also have a template of each model type with reddit formatting already put in. I would just change the numbers, abilities, and names around for everything: MOTD Templates  Both of those links are set up for anyone to edit. So be nice."

Warmachine,3e3l0l,shauni55,15,Tue Jul 21 18:38:00 2015 UTC,"Because Skorne are hideous and Trolls are beautiful, so it gives a nice contrast."
Warmachine,3e3l0l,annoyedandgame,3,Tue Jul 21 19:10:19 2015 UTC,Hoarluk would certainly share that sentiment.

Warmachine,3e3l0l,Greibach,2,Tue Jul 21 19:23:47 2015 UTC,"The Skorne have been there most frequent opponents (alongside Cygnar) is the story so far, so it makes sense why art of them facing off against each other is common."
Warmachine,3e3l0l,MarimoJ,2,Tue Jul 21 22:28:08 2015 UTC,"And if you look at that card, right before it cuts off we can see the letters ""Di"" so maybe it has something to do with dire trolls considering he is THE dire troll caster. Would be awesome if he had like two baby dire trolls with them."
Warmachine,3e3l0l,FriendlyTrollPainter,2,Tue Jul 21 18:22:19 2015 UTC,Most likely the letters spell something like 'Disciple' or something like that.

Warmachine,3e3l0l,sarge113,2,Wed Jul 22 00:26:26 2015 UTC,"I would rather he have 2 Runeshapers/ Runebearers with him that can assist his magical manipulation of the Dire Trolls and Gargantuans.   Like, one is carrying his scrolls (Like pDoomshaper's Scroll of the Will of Balasar) and the other is carrying something like a Runebearer or carrying some kind of totem."

Warmachine,3e3l0l,jasiones,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:56:58 2015 UTC,Maybe those two troll mystics we saw art for in the new Gargantuan video are his unit.

I just hope they make him different from the other Warlock units, especially eGrim. I like eGrim but if they just give Doomshaper3 a bodyguard or two it's not going to feel right.  Doomshaper being a unit doesn't feel right to begin with, so I'm not too hopeful from a design standpoint.  But I've been pleasantly surprised by PP before, so it could be the same here."
Warmachine,3e3l0l,SkaggAteMyPappy,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:47:37 2015 UTC,maybe the lore is explained in the new book.  I wonder what his feat will be being a unit
Warmachine,3e3l0l,krenzalore,-3,Tue Jul 21 19:52:03 2015 UTC,"It just seems kinda weird that Doomshaper would go on a lone quest to tame the Gargantuans for the Trollbloods, and then just end up with some little buddies.   Maybe they're some over-developed Whelps that were shed by a Glacier King and Mountain King and now they're ""grown up"" so to speak. That could mean they're basically lesser warbeasts, which would fit with Doomshaper.  Best case scenario he has a buddy or two from the Runeshapers or Runebearers, or one of each, that buff his magical abilities and control over the beasts. This seems like the best option for actually playability's sake.  If he has a pet or two it could be cooler concept-wise but would probably result in a worse model in actual play."
Warmachine,3e5vki,TheBeefClick,1 point,Wed Jul 22 04:53:49 2015 UTC,"I don't think I've ever put a single Cryx list on the table that didn't have at least one arc node bone-jack and a Slayer/Seether/Leviathan.  Ever.  That said, this is a fairly low point total. Some armies get a little weird at these totals, and the game is really much more balanced at 35-50 and with scenarios.  I really have to recommend the cryx battle-box for starting out in the faction. It lets you learn against other Warmachine battle-box lists - toward which your own battle box is generally balanced. As for contents, slayers are great 'jacks, and death-rippers will never let you down. The defiler is a bit weird but is basically free, and it doesn't really suck either. pDiddy is a good caster with a lot of utility, and she was great for me to learn on.  Lets say you bought what you have in that list. I think you'd learn to appreciate the Helldiver in the occasional list, but it is a niche piece. Mine doesn't get very much use at all, especially now that per point it competes in my head with Scavengers - and I think Scavengers win.  Warwitch Sirens are great solos, but I rarely run more than one. They are a filler model for me, and I really only put one on the board when I think I can justify the occasional power booster/influence. Two of them, and they run out of things to do and just move for board control. If I'm going to move a model for board control, it is going to be a Pistol Wraith.  Tar-tar Sauce and some Bane Knights will serve you LOOONNNGGGG and HAAARRRDDD as a Cryx player. He is a ballin' solo, and they are a ballin' unit. Still, I think I prefer Bane Thralls over Knights, but that might be raw preference."
Warmachine,3e5vki,TheGrimWaffle,2,Wed Jul 22 06:39:19 2015 UTC,Pretty much all flavors of Gaspy want Arc Nodes to jihad jeep into enemy formations and unload trouble. Gaspy1 and 2 especially. Gaspy3 somewhat less because he's appallingly thrashy for a wizard.
Warmachine,3e5vki,gearheadprime,1 point,Wed Jul 22 06:48:34 2015 UTC,"First of all I'm not sure if you're attempting a 15 point list or you're in Europe and using a different points system. If you are going for a 15 point Egaspy list you should know that WarJack points can only be spent on 'Jacks and aren't a 'bonus to the army' pool.   I would drop the Warwitches and then swap the Helldiver for a Defiler, the one remaining point could be used on a three figure 'solo' of Scrap Thralls."

Allows you to play very aggressively, forces your opponent to either deal with them while you run your WGI up, or get demolished turn two. Shield wall infantry have always struck me as boring, they don't really match Butcher's style, and IFP aren't going to be killing casters or beasts anyway so losing your target for Grievous Wounds isn't such a big deal.  Plus they just look so cool."
Warmachine,3e58se,DoBurn,1 point,Wed Jul 22 01:34:53 2015 UTC,"I don't think the defender is going to get as much work done. It generally has a poor ranged game for its points, and it is outclassed by Rowdy in melee, obviously. I think the 30 other guns in the list is enough, and having a credible melee threat is more worthwhile. Also, why no Gun Mages?"
Warmachine,3e58se,mockdante,1 point,Wed Jul 22 02:27:49 2015 UTC,"You need to do whatever works best for your playstyle and what you see in enemy armies.  Keep in mind rowdy helps defend the warcaster and has an AoE knockdown, while also being a beast in melee.  The defenders advantage is more straightforward, but it's a balancing act - if you don't get value from the gun before you charge then you're down in effectiveness....being able to toss snipe on him though means that he should be hitting from bottom of turn one on, provided no stealth/clouds get in the way.  Anyway, Ol' Rowdy is one of the best jacks in the game.  You're not crazy though, I'd definitely try each out and see which works best for you."
Warmachine,3e58se,lolredditor,1 point,Wed Jul 22 03:42:57 2015 UTC,"In my opinion you have three ways to remodel that pCaine list into something else, each bringing in either Rowdy OR the defender OR both. Its just my two cents, but i would suggest those two build paths:   Caine1 6 PC +Ol' Rowdy 9 PC Black 13th Gun Mage Strike Team 4 PC  Arcane Tempest Gun Mages 6 PC  Arcane Tempest Gun Mage Officer 2 PC +Defender 9 PC Stormblade Infantry 5 PC Stormblade Infantry Officer & Standard  3 PC Stormblade Infantry Storm Gunner 3 x 3 PC Journeyman Warcaster 3 PC + Charger 4 PC Rhupert Carvolo, Piper of Ord 2 PC Lady Aiyana & Master Holt 4 PC Captain Arlan Strangewayes 2 PC   This list brings a lot of free focus for Caine out, you have a lot of focus, but you dont like attrition, you have decent melee threat with Defender and Rowdy for the lategame. You get gunmages, which are really essential for Caine, the Defender is a very good jack to get marshaled. I cut Jakes, because i think, she doesnt really fit into a PCaine list at all.  The next option features Jakes and Rowdy and good shooting, also adds a scenario unit in the Boomhowlers and much of your original solo configuration:   Caine1 6 PC Sylys Wyshnalyrr, the Seeker 2 PC Ol' Rowdy  9 PC Captain Arlan Strangewayes 2 PC Lieutenant Allison Jakes 3 PC +Charger  4 PC Rhupert Carvolo, Piper of Ord 2 PC Gorman di Wulfe, Rogue Alchemist 2 PC Arcane Tempest Gun Mages 6 PC +Arcane Tempest Gun Mage Officer 2 PC Black 13th Gun Mage Strike Team 4 PC Stormblade Infantry 5 PC +Stormblade Infantry Officer & Standard 3 PC + 3 Stormgunners 3 PC Greygore Boomhowler & Co. (10 models) 9 PC   Once again some mixup with units, a lot of new jacks, while Cain keeps his defender, the best addition is the hunter in my book, because he gets you more armorcracking, something at which caine prime sometimes suffers, but now you have A+H, Gorman and Hunter to help deal with that.    Caine1 6 PC +Defender  9 PC Captain Arlan Strangewayes 2 PC Lieutenant Allison Jakes 3 PC +Charger  4 PC Journeyman Warcaster 3 PC +Charger  4 PC Gorman di Wulfe, Rogue Alchemist 2 PC Stormblade Infantry 5 PC +Stormblade Infantry Officer & Standard 3 PC + WAx3 3 PC Arcane Tempest Gun Mages 6 PC +Arcane Tempest Gun Mage Officer 2 PC +Hunter  6 PC Lady Aiyana & Master Holt 4 PC"
Warmachine,3e5i1e,Z0mbiemaster,2,Wed Jul 22 02:50:47 2015 UTC,"You'll be surprised how hard it is to face roll with 3 units of bane knights :-)  My suggestion is to make sure you focus on the assassination vector of the game. It is one of our strongest win cases and the most subtle to pull off.   That Gaspy list isn't bad. But it would be better with knights. The problem with bane thralls is there are lots of answers around. So maybe drop them down to a min unit without UA and use them only for the dark shroud on the feat. Everyone knows to kill the flag and two axes and then they are dumb, because 12/15 isn't all that hard to burn through.  You have an almost autokill on that colossal with the feat. Make sure you jam and mini-feat with the raiders on turn one/two if you can. Let them die then, their job is to hit hard once then be in the way. After than you only bring them back if there aren't knights first.  With the bile thralls your going to have a problem because the bane thralls can't screen them. This is another reason why knights are good with gaspy2. Basically you put the 6 of them intermingled with the knights. Opponent has to kill some knights and proc vengeance to get to the biles w/ shooting, so that worked in your favor. If he charges you purge his shit down, still a win. Don't underestimate that choice you are making him take. You either jam these knights with your guys and get purged on, or you send something heavier after them and they kill it next turn. Keep cankerworm around this area so he knows that if he goes after your knights with a heavy he is going to get a sweet armor pierce next turn as well. Finally, make sure this whole little blob of shitty day is heading toward his objective or his caster so he especially can't ignore it.  So that will help you cater that gaspy list. Maybe try playing some deneghra 1 and working on assassination. She is never bad and makes everything work.  Finally, make sure you enjoy playing whoever you are playing. If its not a tournament then ask if you can ""dojo"" a game. Talk things through. Say what you think you should do and point out what you think your opponent should do. Take things back if you mess up order of activation or something similar, but don't let it become a crutch. If someone is kicking your ass every week play another dude around your level."

Warmachine,3e5i1e,Magsato,1 point,Wed Jul 22 04:18:27 2015 UTC,BLT exists to get a good curse or two on the approach followed by a single charge and thresher to make more knights/thralls.  If he lives longer than that its a bonus.
Warmachine,3e5a3e,Th3ErlK1ng,1 point,Wed Jul 22 01:45:57 2015 UTC,"I think Skorne is what you're looking for, though the shooting side of things is much less pronounced, yes. Their newest release(comes out in like 2 weeks), the Aradus Sentinel, is really going to up their ranged game, and make going for a heavy ranged list much more possible. For the most part, you're going to be choosing ranged or melee when you start building your lists, but it can turn into mixed arms fairly easily.  Cygnar might also work well for you, as mercenaries help them hold ground(Boomhowlers, nyss), and the rest of the list will usually be pretty gun heavy."
Warmachine,3e5a3e,mockdante,1 point,Wed Jul 22 02:19:11 2015 UTC,"Skorne is transitioning from a brick style army to a combined army since the release of incindiarii, mammoth, cyclops raider, and now the aradus and croak raiders. It is probably what you're looking for."
Warmachine,3e5a3e,Somethingmorbid,1 point,Wed Jul 22 02:56:33 2015 UTC,IMO Its going to be Cygnar or Khador for you.  Both play pretty balanced lists.  You take a bit of everything.  Skorne on the other hand you're almost always going to have 3 heavies.  Start building some lists.  See if you have anyone you can borrow a list off and give it a go.  Try it on if you will.  Before committing to purchasing it all.
Warmachine,3e5a3e,PartyFoulWMH,1 point,Wed Jul 22 03:26:48 2015 UTC,"Trollbloods sounds like a good fit, though they're a bit heavier on the infantry than most Hordes armies, it's not unusual to run 3-4 warbeasts in a Trollbloods list and I've seen Calandra lists with massive amounts of warbeasts. Trollbloods aren't really known for their shooting, but the Bomber, Blitzer, Impaler, and Slag Troll all have some potent shooting to add to their melee strength.  Legion of Everblight ticks all the boxes with the caveat that we are by no means a durable faction. We can take and hold ground very effectively and have some fantastic scenario Warlocks, but its more our large threat ranges and ability to kill off things contesting a zone that contributes to this."
Warmachine,3e5a3e,PrinceRaven,1 point,Wed Jul 22 03:40:54 2015 UTC,"Skorne and trolls sound good.  However, I will say that Cygnar can hold ground better than you would think - pHaley with two centurions, or more commonly two stormwalls with AS cast on both are incredibly difficult for a lot of lists to remove, especially with gunmages that do push back off of objectives/out of zones.  The casters are also strong with notably eCaine, Siege, and eStryker all being amazing at contributing damage and assassination threat(and constance and sturgis aren't too shabby either).  Heck, you can win some games just by casting AS on siege or constance and camping focus.  Stormblades don't have staying power...but then look at silverline stormguard under either blur, foxhole, or deflection/deceleration and AS in front of them(or trencher smoke clouds, those are making a come back with haley3).  Storm Lances under AS are also really nice.  Khador has some pretty good options as well, Ironfang Pikemen and a couple other options are pretty tough to remove when there's a large zone of inhospitable ground or everything is stationary."
Warmachine,3e5a3e,lolredditor,1 point,Wed Jul 22 04:00:35 2015 UTC,Khador seems like what you want. They have widowmakers and winterguard for shooting and iron fang pikeman and their 'clamjacks' for something durable. They have strong warcasters like butcher and Sorscha that can contribute while also buffing the army.  Winterguard are versatile.  Cygnar is less durable than Khador.

Warmachine,3e4x6z,brianlights22,4,Tue Jul 21 23:59:52 2015 UTC,"Ret are perfectly fine, but they are one of the trickier factions. They are built around assassination more often than not, and that requires really tight play.  Realistically play whichever faction you like as the game is well balanced, and expect to lose a lot no matter what. Warmachine has a steep learning curve."
Warmachine,3e4x6z,GDNerd,1 point,Wed Jul 22 01:05:44 2015 UTC,"Not the best start as there is a pretty steep learning curve to the faction. Khador, Cygnar, Menoth, Skorne, Trolls, and Legion to me are the best factions to use as a starting point."
Warmachine,3e4x6z,closedrop7,1 point,Wed Jul 22 00:02:34 2015 UTC,So what makes it so difficult to learn?
Warmachine,3e4x6z,closedrop7,1 point,Wed Jul 22 00:18:23 2015 UTC,"They are heavily reliant on order of activation. Most of the units have pretty sup par defensive stats and all the feats are dice skew based. Think of it more you have to think further ahead in the game while playing ret than say you do with khador, who can pretty much just walk forward and hit like a truck when they hit. I played them for about a year until I got frustrated with how easy it was to get destroyed on the table and how hard it was to get a good game in.   Don't take this as a discouragement. If you want to play elves go for it, it is merely a warning that you should not be surprised at how often games turn south and how quickly you can get in a bind."
Warmachine,3e4x6z,MeniteTom,1 point,Wed Jul 22 00:34:52 2015 UTC,Perfectly acceptable faction but a motherfucker for a new player to learn.  I've been playing the game for years and I'm still having trouble getting the hang of Ret.
Warmachine,3e4x6z,krenzalore,1 point,Wed Jul 22 00:15:46 2015 UTC,"Skorne have some cultural similarites to Dark Eldar, but their force is primarily based on heavy beasts rather than fast raiding units. They still have a caste of surgeons that experiment on slave beasts and drive them into combat.  Retri are hard to play, but I wouldn't call them weak. It's just there's a lot to remember and get right."
Warmachine,3e4x6z,22cthulu,1 point,Wed Jul 22 00:19:08 2015 UTC,"The thing is Ret haS a tool for every situation, but they don't have the points to bring every tool. If you've got the right tool for the right opponent you'll be laughing all the way to the bank. But if you don't have that tool you're screwed.  I wouldn't suggest them for a starter army, but if you're willing to put in the time to learn the faction, and know what models are used for what situation They're very hard to stop.  It's kind of like the difference between fencing foil and saber."
Warmachine,3e4x6z,tracetrinity,1 point,Wed Jul 22 00:23:05 2015 UTC,Would you suggest Cryx instead then?
Warmachine,3e4x6z,Stisicus,1 point,Wed Jul 22 05:28:03 2015 UTC,"Retribution is a great faction! We have the best looking units, imo, and some of the more trickier casters in the game. It's true we play based mostly on assassination plays, usually this is the case, but I've learned two things that I think will be important for you to have...   Choose a caster that is easy to learn with. I bought the battle box when it came out and the caster in that is NOT forgiving at all. However what she can do, when played correctly, is head over heels better than any other support type caster or lock I've played with or against...again, in my opinion. And her feat isn't anything to turn your head at. But again, if this is your first time playing...choose an easier caster to learn with. Like everyone has already said before...order if activation is paramount to winning. You have to learn what each member of your army does and how they do it. You really do have to think a few steps ahead of yout opponent and basically them to do what you want them to do. It's all about control and making the enemy move how you want them to."
Warmachine,3e4x6z,superrugdr,1 point,Wed Jul 22 01:45:52 2015 UTC,"I Agree with the models! That is nearly 100% of the reason I am looking into Ret.

Warmachine,3e4x6z,PrinceRaven,1 point,Wed Jul 22 02:19:35 2015 UTC,"Ret is not one of the common factions, so folks don't prepare for them a lot.

You will get spanked till you learn your casters, what they work well with, and the best order of activation."

Warmachine,3e34id,derpkhan,3,Tue Jul 21 16:22:09 2015 UTC,"A) Number of models is totally dependent upon a- the army you are using and b-what list you run.  Lists can run as low as 5 models or as high as 50 in more infantry based lists.  B) PP does a really good job of balancing factions, but that's not to say that every faction in on par with one another.  For instance Khador or Minions typically don't place very high in competitive lists.  C) The viability of Warjacks is once again dependant on the faction. While most Warmachine factions are pretty unit heavy, there are plenty of lists are rely heavily on their jacks like CoC.  D) As a former 40k and WHFB player, this was a big concern of mine as well. I dropped GW about a year ago (I was tired of their BS) and moved to PP.  The community was so welcoming and friendly I've made it a point to do the same as I often teach new players (I find myself playing lots of 15 points games and not so much 50 point, which I'm totally cool with).  PP does a good job of supporting its community through different things like the press Ganger program and providing prizes/medals for competitions.  But as with any hobby, there will always be asshats."
Warmachine,3e34id,shauni55,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:28:17 2015 UTC,Khador and Minions have won major events.
Warmachine,3e34id,krenzalore,0,Tue Jul 21 21:02:00 2015 UTC,"i agree with everything said already.  I'd like to add that:   A) i think 20-30 models is a standard 50pt list...if you are planning to be casual then you can easily buy any of the battleboxes (roughly 35$) and like one or two other things and be set for any friendly games which are typically 35pts instead of 50pts.   B) while some forces are more powerful than others, the game is extremely balanced. when you set down your army and they set down theirs you might be at a disadvantage but you don't auto-lose like you do in 40k...(i played a balanced necron list and i HATED losing before deployment...oh you brought that? i brought this...i  lose...gg...ARRRR!!!)even if you are at a disadvantage in warmahordes you can still fight back.    C) sadly warjacks are typically not as strong as they could be simply because the focus mechanic limits them.  if you want big guys then you can either play any of the hordes factions or CoC.    D) the player base is universally good with PP.  i've been to several tournaments in different stores/ cities and i have always had a good time.  whereas when i played 40k  i went to tournaments where people treated me like i was stupid because i wasn't running the necron flying circus (ie, i wasn't being a douche)"
Warmachine,3e34id,arwbqb,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:32:22 2015 UTC,"A. it depends on the faction and points you play.  starting off the game at 15 points is recommended until you get used to the rules   B. As far as I can tell this game is pretty balanced.  There's different ways to counter ""over powered"" models, but some factions have an easier time doing it than others.  C. Warjacks are really useful and there's some who are absolute must buys.   You warcaster has a certain amount of ""warjack points"" that can be allocated to only warjacks, this gives you essentially free points to use towards your warjack so it will be a mistake not to use this up.   D. your mileage will vary on communities, but the ones I have seen around me have been really great! It makes a difference if you have an active press ganger in your area that sets up leagues or tournaments.  This is an open information game, so if you have any questions about your opponent's stuff feel free to ask."
Warmachine,3e34id,jasiones,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:01:28 2015 UTC,"A) Less than 50 unless you build an extreme list. My minions list under 30.  B) The game is one of the best balanced games with a very large competitive community. It's not perfect, but no game of this type can be. Every faction has won a major event. It achieves balance by hard counter, rather than by dice maths. It's like rock, paper, scissors. Each symbol is equally strong and weak, but some are better against others. For a tournament you would bring two lists and pick one at the start of the game, after seeing your opponent's (this way you don't auto-lose to a bad matchup - you pick a list that can handle it).  C) I can't think of a Warmachine list that doesn't have at least one warjack in it. For some lists, the jacks are central, for some they are not. Not everybody will use them in a major way, so you will get some games that are light on jacks. Then again, you can also get effective lists with 38 points of jacks in a 35+6 point list. (Whatever Haley double Stormwall/Stormwall-Gaston-Galleon costs). I lost count of how many tournaments that one won.  D) It's quite competitive but in my area people are good natured about it, as we understand how long it takes to become proficient with a warcaster and their lists."
Warmachine,3e34id,krenzalore,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:08:21 2015 UTC,All you need to know is page 5! fuck the 40k asshat players. Page 5 with the big boys
Warmachine,3e34id,Fossker,1 point,Wed Jul 22 00:36:49 2015 UTC,"A) I have a couple of 50 point lists (roughly equivalent to 2000 points of 40k) that only have 13 models in them, other lists go up to 31. How low model count you can go without crippling yourself depends a lot on which faction you play and which warcaster/warlock is leading the army.  B) Very, every faction has recently won a major competitive event.   C) Warjacks are really good, but this is a game about resource management and having lots of warjacks can stretch your resources thin if you don't have access to support models that act as warjack force multipliers and/or resource management. Convergence of Cyriss, Protectorate of Menoth and, to a slightly lesser extent, Cygnar, have the tools to run 3+ heavy warjacks in a list. Khador and Cryx are generally lacking in the support needed outside of certain warcasters, and will tend to only run 1-2 warjacks.  D) My local community is fantastic, very friendly and encouraging to new players. The online community seems to mirror this."
Warmachine,3e34id,PrinceRaven,1 point,Wed Jul 22 03:18:12 2015 UTC,"A) 12-60, depending on faction and particular list. B) Yes, the different factions are almost perfectly balanced. Every single faction has a decent showing in big tournaments. That being said, not every list is balanced - it's possible to bring some very weak lists, and every faction has a few to several dud models. C) Warjacks are odd. They're really good in the Protectorate of Menoth, but otherwise you tend to bring 1-2 unless you have a damn good reason. Cygnar loves the Stormwall (its colossal). D) The community is literally the best I've ever seen in any competitive game. Not sure why. I've heard it's the same everywhere."
Warmachine,3e34id,Paul-G,2,Tue Jul 21 16:34:35 2015 UTC,"I know you know, but for OP's benefit, Vyros2 in Retri also brings a very large number of warjacks."
Warmachine,3e34id,krenzalore,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:22:36 2015 UTC,"Yeah, and some Cygnar and Cryx (Mortenebra) do as well. Convergence loves 'em too - I was mostly limiting myself to ""fits in with many casters"", but it's true that almost every faction can play Warjack heavy - Khador being the exception."
Warmachine,3e34id,Paul-G,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:05:35 2015 UTC,"IMO Hark and 2 victors counts as warjack heavy. At least by mass and not by number. I do not think the list is that strong but last time I mentioned it, some guys said it was amazing as you can play turn 1 roulette with the flame ammo."
Warmachine,3e34id,krenzalore,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:09:42 2015 UTC,"Yeah, while I agree that it's in some ways ""warjack heavy"", it's still not putting a bunch of 'jacks on the table, which is usually what is meant.  As a recent Cryx convert, double Victor terrifies me. How the heck are we supposed to survive that much fire?"
Warmachine,3e34id,Paul-G,1 point,Wed Jul 22 00:13:34 2015 UTC,They are slow and have a minimum range.  How did you handle double Stormwall?
Warmachine,3e34id,krenzalore,1 point,Wed Jul 22 00:55:01 2015 UTC,"Speed 6 isn't particularly slow, and they can actually hit a Stormwall once in a while. On feat turn the Victor is actually pretty damn tanky, with a longer threat than some Stormwalls.   Plus you have two lists for a reason!"
Warmachine,3e3zi2,darwin_green,2,Tue Jul 21 19:52:29 2015 UTC,If he has line of sight yes ( can see any points)
Warmachine,3e3zi2,superrugdr,2,Tue Jul 21 19:55:23 2015 UTC,There is a Cavalry Rule(not Light Cavalry) called Tall in the Saddle which allows you attack ignoring intervening models with a smaller base size than you when determining LoS.   The only non-Cavalry models to get this rule that I know of off the top of my head is Heavy Warjacks in Krayes battlegroup which become Cavalry. So a Stormclad who has reach can ignore intervening small/medium based models when attempting to attack a model behind them even if it doesn't have official base to base line of sight.
Warmachine,3e3zi2,22cthulu,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:57:49 2015 UTC,"as long as the attacking model has Line of sight and the appropriate distance.  This is why charging with units with reach is so much better, you can stagger them to where the back row has line of sight.   If a large model is attacking a target over smaller based models who are in base to base contact  the attacking model doesn't have line of sight, unless the target is a larger base than the defending models (i think that's correct)"
Warmachine,3e3zi2,jasiones,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:57:57 2015 UTC,Yes and no.  If you do not have line of sight to the model behind the others then the answer is plainly no.  However there are rules certain models have that help get around this.  Heavy Calv can ignore smaller models when attacking so they can attack over things if they can reach.  This is called Tall in the Saddle.  Smaller bases do not block LOS to larger bases: IE Your Juggernaut can still be targeted if it is behind a shield walled Iron Fang Pikemen Unit.    Colossals you can always draw line of sight to.  Friendly models cannot draw line of sight through each other unless they have the ranked attacks rule (i think that is what it is called.)  Stealthed units do not block Line of Sight when it comes to ranged attacks.  Other models can ignore the LOS rule completely (Soulwards and the shaman in skorne for example.)
Warmachine,3e3qxo,superrugdr,2,Tue Jul 21 18:54:30 2015 UTC,"Are you including the UA and standard in the 8 models for the Invictors? Also I'd lose the sniper and bring a Mage HUnter Assassin, but that's just my preference. Lastly, a jack with reach would be nice, so the Invictors can get their extra die."
Warmachine,3e3qxo,FuriKuriFan4,2,Tue Jul 21 19:31:33 2015 UTC,"Change the Manticore to a Phoenix. Reach, stronger gun, arc node, combust, and a regenerating field make it worth the 2 points."
Warmachine,3e3qxo,Rampaging_Elk,0,Tue Jul 21 20:26:34 2015 UTC,Yes the invictor include the UA.  The local shop is trollblood/ khador heavy  That's why I thought of the sniper.but it might work better with the assasin
Warmachine,3e24mf,Cmrade_Dorian,13,Tue Jul 21 11:03:59 2015 UTC,I would like to have a heavy warjack centred army that can tank a lot of damage.  as I love the throwing mechanic. Thanks!   You actually want a hordes army... Skorne!
Warmachine,3e24mf,shauni55,2,Tue Jul 21 11:30:35 2015 UTC,My exact thoughts!
Warmachine,3e24mf,shauni55,2,Tue Jul 21 12:36:47 2015 UTC,"Could you point me to any good hordes guides, as while I have seen a few warmachine ones which touch on hordes, and I get that they are compatible, I don't especially get how the anger and damage spirals work? As I am fleeing warhammer fantasy and gw's crazy-high costs, how much is warmahordes in comparison and how balanced is the game itself?"
Warmachine,3e24mf,Bunglelow,4,Tue Jul 21 13:34:46 2015 UTC,"Battle College is the best place to learn. Fury works sort of like Focus, but instead you simply ""force"" a beast, ie you piss him off to do something (like charge run etc) and put a fury token on him (each beast has a max number of fury they can have on them). Then at the start of your turn, your warlock drains as much fury as they can, equal to their fury stat.  Any fury left on a beast makes it go crazy and you have to make a frenzy test (# of fury on it + 1D6) if the check is higher then it's threshold stat it frenzies and attacks the closest thing to it. Which might be a good thing in some cases  As for damage spirals, they work just like columns, You roll a d6 and determine where the DMG goes. There are 3 types of spirals, Mind Body and Spirit. I ALWAYS get these wrong but it's something like: if Mind is gone you can't boost attack rolls (and I think you roll one less), if Body is gone you can't boost DMG rolls (and one less dice), if Spirit is gone you can't force.    Fury has some different mechanics in other aspects. You don't get an ARM boost of sitting on it, but you can remove one fury to transfer any DMG your lock takes to a beast (that doesn't have max fury on it)"
Warmachine,3e24mf,Cmrade_Dorian,4,Tue Jul 21 13:44:50 2015 UTC,"Just some minor errors, you can still boost when mind/body are gone, but you do indeed drop a die (so you can boost back to 2d6) and frenzy checks are 2D6+Fury on the beast :)"
Warmachine,3e24mf,Cmrade_Dorian,2,Tue Jul 21 20:49:18 2015 UTC,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h5YDlNnk78A  As for cost balance the game is very balanced around 50 pts. If you can find an all in one army box you can get 35 pts for ~$150.\  The cost per model is very comparable (slightly lower) to GW. However WM/H uses fewer models so it is much cheaper. Also you can spend $10-40 for a new caster & essentially have a brand new army because your general changes your force that much.
Warmachine,3e24mf,igetbooored,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:45:22 2015 UTC,"Do you think it would be feasible to have 2 armies at the same time, one for war machine and one for hordes? After having my butterfly-like tendencies end up with me having a smattering of different gw armies I had no way of finishing, both through cost and time, I don't want to do the same thing with warmahordes. I imagine as the battles are smaller it is more feasible?"
Warmachine,3e24mf,arwbqb,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:15:01 2015 UTC,"I have 2 and 1, going for 2 and 2.  The thing I'd say is focus on ONE system until you KNOW it. Then branch out slowly."
Warmachine,3e24mf,shauni55,1 point,Wed Jul 22 01:09:17 2015 UTC,"It's very similar. The main difference is that Warmachine Warcasters get their full focus at start each turn to hand out or spend. Hordes Fury for casters (warlocks) works like a tide. You start the game with full Fury but you then have to generate future Fury with your Warbeasts. How you do this is performing special abilities with your 'Beasts which creates Fury on them, you then Leech (take) that Fury onto your 'Caster where it functions similar to Focus.    The largest differences are the creation tempo and how holding your resources affects you into your opponents turn."
Warmachine,3e24mf,arwbqb,3,Tue Jul 21 15:06:04 2015 UTC,"every faction has at least one jack/ beast that can throw. in terms of tanky warjacks you can join CoC!! we are a limited release faction so it is easy to buy everything and be done :) and all  we do is warjacks.  we have unique mechanics that allow us to run nothing but jacks.  the learning curve for CoC can be kinda high (ie, you'll probably lose a LOT in the beginning) but the faction is very solid and if you stick with it and learn from your losses then eventually people will think your faction is broken...    other than CoC-- menoth is the next best 'jack' faction though at most they will still run about half as many jacks as CoC    if you are open to hordes instead of warmachine then you can look at skorne, trolls, gators...which are all of the tanky beast heavy factions.  though i am a CoC player, i think i'd recommend going the hordes route first.  skorne or trolls would both be very solid places to start as both rely very heavily on their beasts (jack equivalents) and both tend to be fairly tanky."
Warmachine,3e24mf,shauni55,0,Tue Jul 21 11:29:11 2015 UTC,"CoC isn't the best option for new players. Granted they're amazing and fun, but simply they have a high learning curve and their limited released schedule leaves you wanting. But as mentioned, Skorne. Skorne all day."
Warmachine,3e24mf,arwbqb,2,Tue Jul 21 12:37:44 2015 UTC,"people all over the internet say CoC is bad for new players...I started the game with CoC.  I lost a lot.  i learned the game just fine and i don't lose so much anymore.  I am also a completionist so now that i own 90% of the faction i don't feel the need to buy more and more... one of the frustrating parts about being new to this game is learning not only what your models do but what your opponents do...with CoC you have fewer of your models to worry about, i can focus on what my opponents have   and as i said in my initial post i would reccomend going hordes over CoC"
Warmachine,3e24mf,PrinceRaven,2,Tue Jul 21 17:14:34 2015 UTC,"I to started with CoC, and I did lose a lot as well (as most people will) but unlike most people I genuinely enjoy losing as it teaches me more than when I win.  Never the less, there are a few aspects of CoC that are just different and cause frustration with new players. These are all based off of my experiences along with two other brand new players I taught how to play.    1) The limited and wonky released schedule. See all those nice new models coming out in the new book?  No CoC, you'd better get used to it. For some this is ok, but for new players it can get old fast.  When there's a wave of new releases you want to be able to talk to your friends about what you're getting, and with CoC you often can't.  2) The faction isn't 100% ""fleshed out"". As you said there are fewer models in CoC, but this isn't necessarily a good thing. People want new models to try out, especially when it's your first faction. They want to be able to go to the store, pick up a new model and change things around.   3) This is sort of hard to explain, but bare with me on it.  CoC are so unique it's almost like it's a different game than the rest of Warmachine.  While each faction has its unique abilities and skills, CoC sort of stands at the pinnacle of this.  They can't take Mercs, they have no character jacks, and their casters are SO unique from one another that switching a caster often times means buying a completely new list of models (I'm thinking like Axis vs. Mother vs. Aurora). Lucant and Syntherion are probably the closest two.    4) For someone who's never assembled models before (and idk if the OP has) CoC is a nightmare.  Idk what PP did, but their casting is just awful when it comes to lines and flash, and that's coming from someone who's been assembling models for 14 years. I actually had 2 brand new players both pick up the CoC Battle box (against my warnings) and only played a single game with them. Between the assembly then the numerous amount of extra rules they had to learn in the first match with them, they just got overwhelmed.  Although I did get two CoC BB out of it free of charge (teehee)."
Warmachine,3e24mf,GooeyGungan,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:29:30 2015 UTC,"there is nothing wonky about our release schedule (now)...we are released...done :D    i haven't had any trouble with mold lines...i will agree that assembly is horrendous between aurora, lucant, angels, and the foundry...4 legs that all require pinning is not a good time!!  i disagree with the whole ""not fleshed out"" sentiment.  we were released as a whole package, not lacking for anything.  there are toys that we don't have, as you pointed out (stealth, disruption, mercs, character jacks/ units, elemental abilities) but when i look at other factions i see a ton of units that people consider 'unplayable' because they look at the other options and choose the obvious...i look at our faction and everything has its place.  we have very little overlap.    having said all that, it isn't the greatest for newbies but he wanted a jack faction...what else would you call CoC but a jack faction? 3 of our 5 casters prefer to have multiple jacks (axis and aurora can usually pass) and they all can run 2-3 jacks with absolutely no problem...you can't really say that about any other faction."

Warmachine,3e24mf,souledgar,2,Tue Jul 21 17:30:43 2015 UTC,"I'm a Skorne player and would suggest you check out Trolls. They actually are usually the ""tankier"" faction. Although they can run a lot of Infantry.... lists like ""Runes of War"" revolve around making 3 heavy warbeasts damn near impossible to kill between having a wall in front of them and having extremely high armor.  Skorne can get very tank as well though. Rasheth can make his Titans extremely resilient with the support of his feat and the Agonizer solo against other warbeasts.  If you really want tanky Jacks I would recommend Menoth or Convergence. Menoth's newest caster ""Durst"" can make his jacks extremely tanky for one critical turn."

Warmachine,3e24mf,GooeyGungan,2,Tue Jul 21 21:08:56 2015 UTC,"Many (if not most) of us were drawn to this game by the idea of jack-heavy armies, however you'll quickly learn this isn't a very viable option.  Khador, which may appear the jack-heaviest of them all, is in fact probably one of the jack-lightest armies there is. Simply in that they do not have the resources to manage many jacks.  Most armies only ever a take maybe 2 or 3 jacks at a time.  If you're dead set on jacks (and not beasts) then menoth may be the way to go.  They're pretty jack centralized and support them very well.    But as others have stated, what you want is Skorne. They're beasts look amazing and they run them in large numbers.  Most of their beats have two open fists so throwing is totally viable."

Warmachine,3dyo10,manweCZ,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:31:03 2015 UTC,"1- Zenithal highlight priming. Prime black all over, then prime gray from 45 degrees above pointing downward, then again with white from directly above. This is muuuuch easier to do well (IMO) with an airbrush. This creates quick and easy shading.  2- Coat it evenly with Createx Wicked Fluorescent Aqua. Since this is very thin as an airbrush paint it makes the base color of the priming show through. This creates quick and dirty color transitions.  3- Use either a gloss coat varnish or a semi-gloss/satin varnish to give it that shiny look.  Now, if you don't have an airbrush and/or want to use different paints, the darkest parts are pretty close to coal black, the mid-tones are pretty close to Meridius Blue, and the brightest color is close to Arcane Blue. I use those to patch up small areas I accidentally hit with a different color a bit too over-zealously.   The airbrush does make it a LOT easier to get this kind of effect with a lot less effort. There is still plenty for me to work on, but that's the lion's share of it with these guys. Coming from Trollbloods I really wanted a completely different painting style, especially one that was airbrush friendly, so that's how I ended up here."

Warmachine,3e366e,rivenghast,2,Tue Jul 21 17:18:47 2015 UTC,There have been two other posts about this in the last 5 days.  Might want to look in there for details.  https://www.reddit.com/r/Warmachine/comments/3dyahg/warmachine_tactics_night/  https://www.reddit.com/r/Warmachine/comments/3dj770/wm_tactics_in_weekly_humble_bundle/
Warmachine,3e366e,Traitine,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:21:34 2015 UTC,"You're getting a load of other games as well.  I spend $10 on a single solo or a meal at a fast food place.  It's not about worth it for the price, it's just whether you want it or not.  If you want to see Dalin Sturgis/Allison Jakes backstory in the thornwood, and their interactions with a couple of khador guys, then go for it.  Other than that even if it was another xcom...well, then it would be another xcom and I already have like three of those.  There wasn't any way WM:T was going to live up to the hype in the amount of time it came to market, and WMD knew that.  That's why it still isn't marked v1 - they aren't done with the kickstarter goals which they're still working on.  The only reason why it was 'released' was because their publisher(PP >.>) decided to say it was so they could put out their media stuff in NQ and whatnot.  So it's still being worked on in the case of gameplay.  But even then it's just another title in the hundreds everyone already has on steam and doesn't play and the unique part where there would be worth is the story."
Warmachine,3e366e,lolredditor,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:35:34 2015 UTC,"This doesn't appear to include the DLC (unit and faction unlocks). If it does, it's not mentioned.  I tried this again after the other thread on this. Single player campaign was kind of playable before so I just switched it on to look for performance and UI improvements. They are better but it's still not smooth for me on a 770 with Core I7, and screen resolution isn't working right on my main rig (it won't detect it correctly).  Multiplayer is still FUBAR, and you really, really want the DLC units for multi-player. They have balance issues as they have decided to not faithfully translate from Warmachine (they've replaced units with solos, and use diffrent stat values) so they need to rebalance the whole game for the new stats.   Their forums on Whitemoon's site are not publically readable unless you sign in. You see it, but it says 0 posts until you sign in.  You really want to read those, and the steam forums, before deciding. Personally I would say you might enjoy it for $13 if you just want to play the storyline campaign, but you may also want to think about the developer's incentive to fix the software if you buy it before it's fixed."

You won't really be using them both at the same time (at least until you play ridiculously huge games). However, when you have more than one caster from the same faction, you can swap them out, and the difference in their spells and abilities change the way your army plays."
Warmachine,3e1gbd,annoyedandgame,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:48:17 2015 UTC,"Yeah they would be from the same faction, Circle to be specific. I was just hoping to use them both at the same time."
Warmachine,3e1gbd,SiLKYzerg,4,Tue Jul 21 05:51:21 2015 UTC,2 casters are played at 100 point games. The rules are pretty much the same just remember which warlock has which beast in its battlegroup.
Warmachine,3e1gbd,kintexu2,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:15:33 2015 UTC,"In really high point games, like 100+ you would use multiple warcasters/locks at once.  In competitive play, you generally are allowed two full lists at an event with different warcaster/locks, to allow for some variance in your list so that one may pick up the weaknesses of the other.   In casual play, having multiple casters is still nice, as it can give a nice variety to the lists you play, since changing a caster can often change the way a list plays."
Warmachine,3e1gbd,Zhinrak,4,Wed Jul 22 02:42:29 2015 UTC,"Just to clarify, if you are asking if you can play a game of 2 Warcasters/Warlocks vs 1, then the answer is no.  As for the number of Warlocks you can use in an army, as long as the number on each team is balanced, it is up to you and your opponent. Though as others have said, with 2+ warlocks the game becomes almost impossible to balance.  If you are playing with multiple Warlocks here are some things to remember:   The number of Warlocks/Warcasters per team must be balanced (2v2, 3v3 etc) Warjack/Warbeast points on a warcaster must be used on his/her own battle group.  All Warcaster/Warlocks must be from the same faction, or Mercernary/Minions who will work work with other factions used.   There are rules in the Colossals book for 'unbound' games which are intended for 3+ Warcaster/Warlocks with 150+ points. These do sound fun (and can work very well for more than 2 player games), how ever they do over complicate a lot of the core rules. If you are still starting out I would suggest avoiding these rules and multi-caster battles in general until you have a better understanding of the game."
Warmachine,3e1gbd,ThaiChickenWrap,2,Tue Jul 21 08:00:58 2015 UTC,"The rules support use of multiple warlocks, but only in larger games.  These games get far larger than any game I want to play, so I haven't looked into it much at all.  All I know is that it can be done."
Warmachine,3e1gbd,Cmrade_Dorian,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:15:39 2015 UTC,"Normal play is 1 warlocks. But there's nothing stopping you from playing 2 at any point level. I mean you could do 2 warlocks at 35 points if you wanted. Officially it is recommended you play at least 100 pts when adding a 2nd lock. Also game balance kind of goes bye-bye when you add a 2nd lock.  As for say playing 2 locks Vs 1 lock. There is no official rules for this. That's not to say you can't but it'd be extremely hard to balance. I'd say a lock is worth around 15-20 pts. So if you had 2 locks at 35 pts your opponent would have at least 50 pts. Again completely unofficial, but if you want to be silly nobody can stop you, provided you & your opponent agree.  Again there is nothing stopping you, just understand it isn't the normal & you need to keep track of who is controlling which beasts, which are in whose battle group. it would really complicate the game and I don't recommend it for new players at all."
Warmachine,3e1gbd,luke_luke_luke,0,Tue Jul 21 08:02:57 2015 UTC,"Not realistically. There are rules for something like that but the game can't remain even remotely balanced at higher points levels with 2 warlocks. The possible synergies just explode, and the game takes much longer to play."

Warmachine,3e0imh,Greystorms,2,Tue Jul 21 00:44:36 2015 UTC,"I was a bit disenchanted with Warmachine for a really long time, and after playing some great games the past few weeks, the bug seems to have caught me again.  So naturally the first thing I did was make a dice bag with ""Focus"" screen printed on it in a military-style stencil font, Khador colors naturally.  (Full disclosure: I make dice bags all day long and have an Etsy at greyedout.etsy.com)  I also did a ""Fury"" version."
Warmachine,3e0imh,Cmrade_Dorian,2,Tue Jul 21 00:47:24 2015 UTC,"So it's a cloth bag... with the word ""focus"" on it...for $20...plus shipping...  I mean it'd be cool if there were logos or faction symbols but even so I have focus counters not focus dice. Even then I really don't want to spend $20 on a dice bag when I could get a plain one & spray paint a stencil for like $5..."
Warmachine,3e0imh,shauni55,2,Tue Jul 21 09:54:26 2015 UTC,"Right.  You totally could. And that's cool.    Talking about the dice bag itself - I make these myself.  I don't order them by the thousands from some factory in China; every dice bag you get from me is something that I've put together and screen printed.  It takes me about 45 minutes to an hour to make one of these from start to finish, not counting the time to screen print it, wait for the ink to dry, ironing, etc.  So, personally, even though I may be a little biased, I think $20 for a handmade, screen printed dice bag is a steal.   :)"
Warmachine,3e0imh,ctsamuraix,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:20:51 2015 UTC,"While these are nice, I think the opportunity to make them more unique is the big seller here. idk what sorts of color bags you have access too, but if I'm playing Cygnar chances are I'm not going to buy a red bag (Unless my cygnar are red).  Not to mention the countless options for symbols you could do. I wouldn't pay $20 for a bag that says ""fury"", but I'd easily shell our over that for a bag (of whatever color) with my faction's logo on it."
Warmachine,3e0imh,shauni55,2,Tue Jul 21 16:31:45 2015 UTC,"Downside of doing that is that there could be legal issues if you sell items with Privateer's copyrighted images on them. Not sure how strict they are with it, but it's POSSSIBLE that they might have an issue with it."
Warmachine,3e0imh,ctsamuraix,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:42:41 2015 UTC,"Good point, I know others have made their own symbols in the past. So that may be an option."
Warmachine,3e07fq,cirto,2,Mon Jul 20 23:14:05 2015 UTC,"From what I've heard mercenaries are a difficult army to play, especially for starters, and have a hard time dealing with certain factions without their colossals.  That being said, go for it if you love the models and the theme. A good start for a pirates list may be the journeyman league pirates starter:  Captain Bartolo Montador  • Mariner  • Freebooter  • Buccaneer  I'd suggest playing some battle box games, get a feel for the rules, and where possible, magnetise your jacks so you can build more lists. Once you understand the rules better, expanding your list will be much easier.  Also, keep in mind that mercenary armies actually have their own separate pools of models to pick from, even within the faction itself. Talion Charter is the pirate one, Seaforge is dwarves and ogrun, Four Star Syndicate are the bad mothers that work for Khador and/or Cryx, and Highborn is the Cygnar allies. You can run the Four Star as pirates because most of the pirates work for Cryx or Khador if you want a bit more variety, but Phineus Shea can only work with Talion Charter.  I've also seen it suggested before that Cygnar is a good faction to start with if you want to go mercenaries since they work well with a lot of mercs. I don't think this would work too well with pirates though.  Edit: I forgot to mention, you don't need their permission to play mercenaries. Your money, your business. :p"

Warmachine,3e07fq,DemonGyro,2,Tue Jul 21 02:21:55 2015 UTC,"No problem. Hope it helps. Also, have you been to BattleCollege yet? It'll help you get an idea for what a model is capable of and how it is generally used."
Warmachine,3e07fq,nappa15,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:26:08 2015 UTC,I ended up going with  Warmachine: Mercenaries - Renegade Light Warjack    x   2 Warmachine: Mercenaries - Warcaster Magnus the Traitor Warmachine: Khador - Kayazy Assassin Underboss Warmachine: Khador - Kayazy Assassin Allies Unit Box (10) And one mariner heavy jack. Is that ok?
Warmachine,3e07fq,DemonGyro,2,Tue Jul 21 02:39:26 2015 UTC,"Just remember with a mariner you have to keep someone b2b with him to shoot. You might consider a mangler, nomad, or mule. So you don't need to park your caster on him. Heavy jacks have a low defense so you're gonna be risking aoe damage if he sits on your jack. And using your unit to do the trick forces you to keep everything rather close together. You'll be able to spread out a bit with a mule acting as your ranged jack. The Mariner and the Mule are pretty similar for ranged heavies. Mule is a bit better if you don't have a model you want to dedicate to firing the mariner."
Warmachine,3e07fq,DemonGyro,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:06:22 2015 UTC,"Good to know, thanks!"
Warmachine,3e07fq,DemonGyro,2,Tue Jul 21 05:34:29 2015 UTC,"That should be a good start. In addition to what nappa said, you might have some issues with heavy armour. Give the list a bit of play first though and feel out what is causing you the most issues. At 15 points, its good to just go at it and learn from your games because you have plenty of room for expansion and improvement."
Warmachine,3e07fq,nappa15,1 point,Tue Jul 21 10:45:04 2015 UTC,"Ok, good to know! What would be a good way to deal with heavy armor?"
Warmachine,3e07fq,krenzalore,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:15:36 2015 UTC,"it is really good that I have a way to deal with heavy armor, as one of my friends plays khador, and those guys are tough!"
Warmachine,3e0ysn,SirPooky,3,Tue Jul 21 02:57:24 2015 UTC,"Another viewpoint is that Jacks can actually be pretty amazing.  Keep in mind that whether it's a unit or a jack, there are ways to wipe out either in a single turn.  Everything on the board is just an expendable pawn except for the warcaster.  Your goal is to get up a few models and then start straight trading until you can easily assassinate the opponent with your advantage.  The easiest most universal avenues for an assassination is for a warjack or beast to slam one of their own infantry models in the back to knockdown the enemy warcaster, then buy a couple of attacks to kill it.  That doesn't work without a heavy, so if you only have one then the enemy can easily take out a powerful option very early on.  Something that has limited the amount of warjacks is colossals - when you put a colossal in your army it takes up 18-19 points.  That's a lot in just a single warjack, so players then need to get units for more bodies.  A list with three heavies in place of a colossal can absolutely do well though, and provide options that wouldn't be available with the colossal.    3 is pretty jack heavy though.  I wouldn't expect to see more than three heavy jacks in anything other than a menoth, cyriss, or jack caster skew list.  One heavy and two lights is much more common(with one light being either marshalled or with a journeyman warcaster), or just two heavies."
Warmachine,3e0ysn,lolredditor,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:03:10 2015 UTC,"So, I'm going to answer your questions a little out of order.  1) Yes, Jacks/Beasts are absolutely necessary for the game.  You are required to have at least one.  2) Generally speaking, you will see most of the Hordes factions running Warnoun heavier than Warmachine factions.  Legion in particular takes this to an extreme, but all Hordes Factions do have  ""Beast Brick"" type lists.  2a) You will usually see the Warmachine Factions (despite the name) running the bare minimum of Jacks.  This has a lot to do with the differences between Warbeasts/Jacks and Fury/Focus, but by and large the general consensus among the player is base is that Jacks are total shit for their points with a few notable exceptions.  I am not saying Jacks suck, what I am saying is that in the current meta an equivalent point expenditure is usually more efficient when spent on Units or loads of Solos than on Jacks.  Khador, Cryx, Mercs, Ret and Cygnar lists typically have 1 Heavy, and maybe an Arc Node and then lots of units/solos.  There are exceptions - Vyros2 for example, runs a shit load of Lights.  Colossals are a notable exception to the above policy, in that a few of them see very regular play - notably Stormwall and Galleon, but also Judy, Earth Breaker and Prime Axiom.  3) There are factions that run Jack/Beast Heavy.  Menoth & Convergence of Cyriss are the prime ""Jack Heavy"" WM factions.  Convergence has Convection which allows jacks to share Focus, and Menoth has the Choir and Vassals that make their jacks better than everyone elses (and they're under costed to boot).  Both of these factions can afford to run these Jacks because they have mechanics that are better than Focus Allocation.   All of that said, the ""best"" performing CoC list has historically been Axis's Theme List (which is dude spam) and the ""best"" Menoth caster (i/e she appears in the most major tourney pairings) is Harby, and she runs a dude spam list too...usually only bringing one Devout.  What does it say about Jacks when the two Jack factions don't run Jacks?  If you like the big stompies, play Hordes.  Every Hordes faction can run lots of beasts and do exceptionally well.  Most of the competitive Hordes lists have 2-4 Heavies in them (3 seems the sweet spot), but some have as many as 6 (in extreme examples).  Why is this?  Fury & Animi.  A Warjack is a tank.  That's it.  Armor, a weapon(s) and hit boxes.  A Warbeast is like adding a spell to your warlock's card.  If you don't give a jack Focus its not doing shit.  Warbeasts can go BANANAS as long as they're in your control area.  Need to run hot to get a good Alpha? Go for it! Even if they frenzy it won't matter if you're far enough ahead on Attrition!  4) Standout Warjacks:  In no particular order -    Menoth: Reckoner, Vanquisher, Avatar of Menoth.   Cygnar: Stormwall, Dynamo, Ol'Rowdy Khador: Ruin, Beast 09, Spriggan Ret: Imperatus, Banshee Mercs: Rocinante?  Galleon, Earthbreaker.   Standout Beasts:   Skorne: Gladiator, Bronze Back, Krea, Molik Fucking Kharn Circle: Stalkers, Wolds (of various typles) Ghetorix Legion: Scythean, Ravagore, Seraph, Angelius, Typhon, Raek Trolls: Mulg, Mulg, also Mulg. Minions:  Wrastler, Swamp Horror   I've almost certainly missed some standouts, I don't really know a lot about Circle or Ret or Minions.  That's my opinion on the matter, I'm sure some others have better/different viewpoints."

Basically your Warlock forces the war beasts to do things, which causes them to generate one Fury point.  The Warlock can then suck up that Fury in order to cast his own spells.  This is kind of dangerous, because if you make a Warbeast mad by making it generate Fury, there is a chance it will go berserk and try to smash whatever's closest to it.  That's the gist, at least."

They have gator posse which are an amazing unit, but other than them coupled with the Black Hide Wrastler they come up short on their own merits.  Gators are my main factions and I own almost every single model for them, but as sad as it is to say their best models normally work better in OTHER factions. IE Posse in Skorne or Vault in Circle."
