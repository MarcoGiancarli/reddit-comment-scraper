I'd like a little data, some outcomes, to validate that we're actually doing shit here. Posting followup in the same sub also makes it easier to point future posters to past experiences.  And for the record, none of this is unbelievable /r/thathappened material. Guy got asked out, went to dinner and then sat and talked after."

I mean good on him for having a what, a good run in and a date? Woo lets upvote a story in an askreddit!

If you came to askgay/bros and are actually shocked to find anything other than a sea of confused people looking for acceptance, guidance, advice and opinions, then I really don't know what to say to you.   We live in a heteronormative society, we can barely do secularism, you think gay people who most of us have to live in shame due to upbringing and rejection by our own families are just gonna figure life out on our own?  Like I said, I'm happy he had a good date and asking a guy out didn't backfire in his face.   But I don't see the point putting it here. Guess I'm going to write a long winded story about the guy I met on here and flew across the ocean to meet and fall in love with.

He's got your message, the more you try to force an answer, the worse you will feel. He knows how to contact you, and if he wants to, let him. Then he can answer why he was so distant. Start dating new guys."

You should just send him a text saying ""If you don't want to see me anymore for what ever reason Thats fine, Just say so.

I didn't even know my guy as long as you and your guy knew each other, but being ghosted hurts just the same. I can't believe people can have the nerve to just completely drop out like that, without any warning or provocation. I got pissed and sent a text saying something like ""no big deal if you're not interested anymore, but please just say so"" and he didn't even respond...thinking about him still kinda pisses me off and makes me sad simultaneously.

There are many people out there who deserve you. he's a jerk and he doesn't deserve you."
askgaybros,3e1st0,evans04,3,Tue Jul 21 12:59:41 2015 UTC,"I'm so happy I came across this post because I'm going through the exact same thing -- verbatim, and we're the same age. My advice to you is don't call and don't text him (I know it's hard but don't do it). You need to grieve your loss and you need to find closure.   I was the crazy ex-gf too so I know how you feel. It's like there's a gapping hole in your heart and you just don't know what to do, but that's because you (we) never received closure. It's one thing for couples to gradually drift but it's another thing when someone abruptly leaves.   The dude that I was with still has a photo of us as his default photo on FB and it's like wtf. It's been almost a month since he stopped talking to me. I'm learning that this is something I have no control over -- I'm not in his head and I shouldn't take it personal (crazy as that sounds, it makes me feel a hell of a lot better).   These are some of the things I'm doing to get through it.    Today I'm volunteering at my local soup kitchen - I find that giving back is a great way to fill your heart with gratitude and love.  Tomorrow I'm taking a five day vacation - you need to treat yourself because you come first.  I workout and I run -  to release the endorphins in my brain.  I meditate (I try to)  - releasing stress  Last but not least, I'm going through my feelings and not around them.    Good luck, and I'm sorry for your loss."
askgaybros,3e1st0,oskietje,2,Tue Jul 21 16:34:46 2015 UTC,"Really sorry this happened, man. There isn't a way to get by what you're feeling other than to keep pushing forward. Be angry, be upset, cry. Mourn the loss because it meant something to you. Time doesn't always heal wounds. Sometimes that wound is so deep that all time does is make it a little easier to bear the pain."
askgaybros,3e1st0,megustadotjpg,2,Tue Jul 21 14:57:58 2015 UTC,"Sometimes I think that gay men are so afraid of making a connection, that when they do, they freak out like this. It's sort of ironic given that most profess to want that connection, but when they get it they freak."

The trick is to get to a point where you're experienced enough with toys, and relaxed and comfortable that it won't hurt (much).

So I go completely dry for 2 weeks every 3 months.    AA is really shitty in that they make you feel like you've wronged people just by drinking.  You haven't.  Not inherently at least.  What you need is a buddy, someone who you can be accountable to, to help you stop.    I live by one key principle when it comes to stopping drugs, alcohol, and behaviors.    You cannot stop till the desire to quit is greater than the desire to do it.  In other words, you cannot stop drinking until the desire to quit is greater than the desire to drink.  Once you have reached that point, then you can begin the road back.    You need, at the very least, a buddy, a friend, anyone who you can be accountable to.  This is the greatest benefit of AA.  If I have to look someone in the eye and explain how I fell off the wagon, I'm less likely to fall off the wagon.    Here are some links to help get you started.   http://www.addictionrecoveryguide.org/resources/recovery/rational_and_secular  http://www.smartrecovery.org/?gclid=CIqYgNf_7MYCFcESHwodwqAMjQ  https://www.hellosundaymorning.org/pages/alcoholics-anonymous?gclid=CJX6tdr_7MYCFY2RHwodGa8JVg  Good luck buddy.  I walked two college buddies through the flood to being recovering alcoholics.  Its not easy.  But you can do it.  Just remember that no matter how awful or difficult life seems without alcohol, its only temporary while your mind is relearning how to deal with life."
askgaybros,3e3xi7,materhern,2,Tue Jul 21 19:53:33 2015 UTC,"Okay, the shaking and dizziness stuff when you miss a night of drinking sounds an awful lot like alcohol withdrawal which is not good.  You've been drinking hard enough and long enough that it's a real possibility.  In the worst case, it can can cause cardiac arrhythmia and seizures and kill you.  Do not stop cold turkey without talking to a doctor first.  Even if you don't want to stop drinking (the idea scares me too, bud), you can successfully commit to reducing how much you drink.  I have a simple method for that, I decide how much to drink the next day when sober, and keep no more alcohol on hand than for that.    Don't keep alcohol stockpiled in the house, every day you're going to drink, go to the store when sober and buy exactly as much as you will allow yourself to drink that night.  You can't drink over your limit if you don't have any extra on hand."
askgaybros,3e35pa,solidarity4ever,12,Tue Jul 21 16:30:47 2015 UTC,"I think straight guys have an enormous amount of baggage when it comes to sticking stuff in their butts to get over, that gay men mostly discard when they accept being gay.  Mainstream culture pervasively advances the idea that if a dude takes anything in the butt, he's gay.  Even if it's a strap-on his wife is wearing.  I figure straight guys probably like stuff in their butt, in a physical sensation sense, as much as gay men do.  They may be less likely to enjoy the psychological aspect of being penetrated but some straight dudes into pegging talk about the thrill of submitting to their girlfriend/wives, so who knows."
askgaybros,3e35pa,indomante,5,Tue Jul 21 16:49:08 2015 UTC,"I bet it's also a bit of selection bias.  Most straight men will never have anything put up their butts like that, and therefore will never think of it as something they'd enjoy."
askgaybros,3e35pa,NovaNardis,3,Tue Jul 21 16:59:25 2015 UTC,"I honestly think it's just a matter of gay men being more open and willing to experiment.  Being penetrated is associated with being female and passive - both things that men are taught are wrong.  Gay men don't have those concerns as much because we're already gay, the lowest we could possibly sink on the male social ladder, what's the worst that could happen from taking a dick in the ass?"
askgaybros,3e35pa,ssnobele,2,Tue Jul 21 17:59:35 2015 UTC,I'd definitely bet on it being a fairly big combination of three things. A. straight guys who like butt stuff almost never actually talk about it or admit to it as in mainstream media it's thought of to basically mean you're gay or not a man if you enjoy any sort of penetration. So you rarely hear someone vocal about it.   B. This correlation to society's disapproval also likely means that in the back or forefront of their mind they are constantly thinking about how wrong the act is. It's like being disgusted by two guys kissing. In reality it's really no different from seeing a straight couple kiss and that isn't making you vomit. Most of the cause is social perception. If you're constantly thinking about how gross something is its hard to enjoy it.  C. Straight guys have vaginal sex. And in most relationships are thought of as the penetrating partner. They don't have to have anal to have penetrative sex. And a lot straight men only think of their penis as their sexual organ. Where as in the gay community we have a widespread understanding that your ass/prostate can also be a place of sexual stimulation. To put it simply. We do it more. Of course you see more gay guys enjoying it. It's kind of like asking 20 people who went to the zoo if they liked lions but the Lions were only on display in the corner and only for a few minutes so only ten 10 of them ended up seeing them. It's not that half didn't like the Lions. They just never even realized that they were able to see them because they were looking at the rest of the park.

So I don't know if there's such a big gay/straight divide. Plenty of gay men prefer manual and oral stimulation. The emphasis on penetrative sex is a bit hetero-normative in it's own way.

Most of my craps involve one or two wipes(there is usually nothing), and I always ALWAYS end it with a wet wipe then a dry wipe.  I am being serious, just buy wet wipes and keep them in the bathroom, they do basically the same thing.  You can also just make sure you always have a ""solid"" one by eating lots and lots of fibre, I just luckily do that because I enjoy fruits so much.  I'm not a bottom, but I would be the perfect one because of my diet and habits(I am obsessed with being clean)  I also go at the SAME time everyday, literally same time everyday, within a couple of minutes of waking up, and I only go once a day, so I always have a shower after guaranteed.

If you don't already instinctively know what to do with a BDSM slave, you probably are not going to make a satisfactory master.    Yes, it's something you can learn to some degree, especially in the bedroom.  I even came to enjoy stuff like making him slowly undress me after a long day at work and pouring me a beer and making him worship me.  It was good, kinky fun.    But to be honest, my heart was never truly into it.  It was roleplay and a kink on the side.  I didn't have the lifestyle commitment.  There was no way I could keep it going 24/7 in a relationship, certainly not like the way a guy with a true, natural dominant personality could.  And we both knew that, and recognized it pretty early on.  It just wasn't meant to be.  He's still a buddy I play with, but I couldn't fulfil what he truly needed.  Same thing with a slave, a guy can learn to play the role and enjoy it, but true commitment to that lifestyle is innate and comes from the heart.  You either have it, or you do not."

If you start to find yourself aroused by men or imagining sexual acts with other men, then you're starting to get into not-quite-straight territory.  My advice for you is to take a step back and review your feelings rationally.  Do you have any desire to touch, kiss, or sleep with a guy?

Or maybe, like me, he shuts his eyes when he's focusing on what he's doing and what he's feeling in the moment.   Aside from talking through what his actual reasons are, you can try bringing eye contact as a sexual element into your relationship.   Ie. During sex, say to him in your sexiest voice ""I want you to look me in the eyes while you fuck me"" or ""look at what you're doing to me/see how hard I am/etc"".

I know that is so so difficult. When our sexuality is evolving it is a very destabilizing experience, and it's admirable to try to put the work in and explore what these new feelings mean so that you have a better sense of yourself. However, you are only human dude. This situation feels very confusing but it's actually really simple.  Sometimes you get turned on by gay fantasies. Sometimes you don't. That's it! that's not so scary, right? If you're sitting around bored and you wanna jerk off thinking about guys, go crazy. Those feelings may completely subside midway through and suddenly you're picturing a woman. Doesn't matter! Your sexual impulses do not define your identity or your relationships. You don't need to figure all of this out right now, just try to  accept these fantasies as a banal, harmless presence in your life. Continue living your life as usual, and allow these feelings to swell and subside naturally.  Later down the line, they may grow and you may find yourself more interested in men than before. They may go away completely. Don't try to force it either way, don't feel guilty or like you are lying by presenting yourself as straight to the world. Just chill. If you were usually an ass man and suddenly you were more attracted tits, it wouldn't cause an identity crisis. This is pretty much just as inconsequential."

If I didn't feel anything with the girl OR the guy, what the hell was I?!  Turns out, I didn't feel anything because I had no emotional connection or attraction to either of those people.  I soon found someone I actually liked, and making out with that person was awesome.

askgaybros,3e1gga,Y6Y1Y9,9,Tue Jul 21 14:46:11 2015 UTC,"I kinda have the same issue. I'm black as well but tend not to be attracted to other black guys (though it's definitely happened before, they're just the ones i'm attracted to the least often). If it's a thing for you where you genuinely just haven't been that attracted to them much, they just aren't the type you go for and there's nothing wrong at all with that. There's no rules that say everyone has to prioritize their own race first in attractiveness. However, if it's a thing where you automatically write off all black guys without giving them a look over or to get to know them a little bit and put on your dating/hook up profiles ""No black guys, don't even try!"" type stuff. Then there's some internalized racism going on there. I know exactly what caused it for me though. For me personally i grew up in a place where the vast majority of the town was black people. And the majority of them all acted a similar way. They were super into ""black culture"". Hip hop, mostly/exclusively watched entertainment aimed at the black audience, acted hard and gangsta (there were instances of gang violence at my high school a couple times), and they often were very close minded and unaccepting of different cultures. I was/am very ""white acting"" according to them. I like music of all types, like tv shows and movies of all kinds. Spoke proper English. And didn't wear the same type of clothes as them. I wore clothes that fit me that didn't have giant portraits of Biggie and Tupac like almost all of them did. And for all four years in high school they relentlessly bullied me for it. Would call me a traitor to our race, oreo, all that kind of stuff. ""Why you act like them white folks so much? What's your fucking problem, yo?"" And that's all not including throwing being gay into that mix when that eventually got out. It was just really bad. I'd even get the ""You don't act like us"" stuff from my family sometimes. And now at 24 years old i'm very aware that it really traumatized me, feeling so rejected by ""my people"". And i think my tendency to not be attracted to black guys who show any sign of being like that comes from that trauma. Doesn't really necessarily make it right or justify it. But i'm well aware that that's where it stems from for me. However, i always do if i meet a black guy or see one on OKCupid or Grindr or whatever, long as they don't look like that thug type, i will absolutely give them the chance to show me they aren't mentally like those guys from my past. A lot that i've come in contact with have proven to have a lot of elements of it and a few have shown themselves to be really cool guys. I never put on my profiles that black guys can't message me or try and i try and be as honest and descriptive as possible about the things i like and don't like on my dating profiles so that it kind of automatically weeds out the dickheads."

I actually find all races hot and attractive, but I think I have a programmed bias that guys I can feel comfortable with who will share my interests tend to be white.  Maybe it's just the numbers talking because there just seem to be more single white guys who are into me that I can click with on that level.  A lot of the POC guys I know who are mega hot and smart and cool are ... TAKEN.  And usually dating another white guy.

askgaybros,3e1gga,Jaemii,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:21:10 2015 UTC,"It's not about ""white"" features (at least in my case) with regards to celebrities. As far as physicality goes, that is just what I am attracted. Generally asians are seen as ""feminine"", slim, submissive which is NOT a problem. In my case though, it's just not what I am attracted to but a good majority in my area just happen fit that description. I mean, John Cho is very much asian in appearance. There is no ""white features"" but I find him very much attractive.   Plus it's also how asians are percieved in the media. Look at hollywood. Rarely are asian men seen as love interests. Asian woman are stern and have no feelings. We're often put in the role as comedy relief. The accents are made fun of, they make fun of height, and I also blame the actors themselves for allowing them to be portrayed in such a way. Asians are often seen to ""not be taken seriously"". It's a problem especially in western media. And if we are taken seriously... it's when we're a samurai, or a ninja, or villian or anything of that sort.   White people have and will continue to be admired. I go to Asia and there are so many ""whitening skin"" products. Procedures for a double eye lid surgery to enlarge the eyes. Heck when I went to visit my family, they all praised me asking how am I so light skin? What do I do? I can be a celebrity because I'm so ""white"". It's unfortunate but it is what it is.   However all of that just comes down to the individual and how they view themselves. Like I said, is it racist to not date someone of your race (or any race for that matter) because you're just not attracted to their appearance? No. Is it racist to not date someone BECAUSE of their race however, then I would consider that racist.   If someone said to me ""I'm just not attracted to asians"". I would be okay with it. You cannot force attraction. But if the person said ""I'm not attracted to you BECAUSE your asian and BECAUSE of your heritage""... then that's where I would have a problem."

People here are telling you it's 100% okay because they want it to be 100% okay. But OP, it's definitely not normal to be completely unable to be attracted to someone just because they're a certain race, and it's extra weird when it's your race.    You might want to take a close look and figure out where this came from (maybe with the help of a therapist). You might uncover further issues. You don't need to try and force yourself to feel attracted to someone because they're black, but maybe there's something keeping you from being able to have a natural, organic feeling of attraction to someone because they're black.

That said, I'm not exclusively attracted to white guys or exclusively attracted to masculine guys. I find some feminine guys attractive, I find some masculine guys attractive, I find some non-white guys attractive, so on and so forth. I've lived in a racially/ethnically diverse, LGBT-friendly area in Southern California for awhile, and I've gotten used to meeting all different types of people over the years, so that's probably why I don't have a specific type of guy that I'm interested in.  This past year, I went on a date with a white guy from Tennessee who moved to SoCal for work about 5 years ago. He was a nice enough guy, but I could tell that he had probably grown up in a racist household. At one point during the date, he said something to the effect of, ""I don't sleep with Asian guys because a lot of them smoke, and that's gross."" My response was something like, ""What does smoking have to do with being Asian? There are some non-Asian smokers… You can just say that you'd prefer not to sleep with guys who smoke."" He seemed kind of taken aback by what I said. I guess he thought that because I'm white, I'd just nod my head when he said that he doesn't sleep with Asian guys.  The bottom line is, I don't really care if other people have preferences… What people do in the bedroom is none of my business. It's the way they state their preferences that sometimes bothers me, not the preferences in and of themselves. The stereotypical guy on Grindr who says, ""No fats, no femmes, no blacks, and no Asians"" isn't a douchebag because he has preferences; he's a douchebag because he's hating on minorities. All you have to do is just refrain from responding to people's messages if you're not attracted to them… You don't have to make people feel bad and say, ""I don't like X, Y, or Z. Don't message me unless you're A, B, or C."" (And by the way, I've never seen a Grindr profile that says, ""Don't message me if you're a masculine, white guy. I only like non-white, feminine guys.""

I found plenty of guys who are into black guys, and I do not allow people who are not attracted to me affect my life. I just feel like people want to be wanted by people they are attracted, but the attraction is not always mutual.

askgaybros,3e02ip,AlejoHoots,6,Tue Jul 21 01:58:06 2015 UTC,"Simple question without a simple answer. Gender identity is a part of a person's larger cultural identity, especially their ethnic culture, so the ""definition"" differs greatly depending on a person's personal background. The idea that there's a singular ""definition"" or universal set of characteristics involved is inherently ethnocentric, which makes most arguments on the subject seem naively myopic.  The trouble is that, while people tend to respect things like male rites of passage and socialization norms of distant cultures, there's an almost complete reversal of attitude in many of those same people when it starts taking place too close to home. Huge double standard there.  Without having grown up in the environment which I did, having run with the same crowd, and having accomplished the same sorts of things I have which make up my personal identity and sense of self worth, any answer I could give you to this would fit in no very good context for you.  Yes, I am gleefully ""complicating the conversation."""
askgaybros,3e02ip,Chris770,5,Tue Jul 21 02:21:05 2015 UTC,"Actually you are taking the conversation to a great place.  I'd rather people be specific.  If a guy wants a guy who loves sports and the outdoors, there's nothing wrong with that.  If they want someone with a dominant personality, there's nothing wrong with that.  I prefer men with facial hair and body hair as that gets my manly motors running, but if said guy likes to knit and read poetry, that doesn't make him less masculine to me.  There are a variety of masculine archetypes.  I've been thinking a lot about the geek as a masculine archetype after having a long talk with a FWB about comics and graphic novels and we both turned into wide eyed boys talking about it.  I realized it was a very primal, masculine thing we shared. But in my mind when I hear ""masc."" I think muscles, beard, sports, outdoors, frat guy.  These pat definitions are so confusing."
askgaybros,3e02ip,AlejoHoots,5,Tue Jul 21 02:29:35 2015 UTC,"It's confusing because you're looking for a simple definition where none exists. My sense of masculinity is going to be very different from that of a guy who grew up in a tribal community in sub-Saharan Africa. Different rites of passage, different gender-based social expectations, different male socialization modes, etc. Both are equally valid, and both are strongly part of a person's cultural and social identity.  The difference is that, while people are likely to respect the gender-based cultural traditions of that tribe, many of those same people turn their nose up at the rites of passage, socialization modes, cultural expectations, etc. of a guy who grew up in the southern rural United States. I wouldn't expect anyone who isn't from my background to understand those things, the best I could do is ask that people respect them, and unfortunately it's a large trend in the ""gay community"" not to do so.  A factor for me personally is that I lived the first eighteen years of my life completely outside the influence of the ""gay community"" or ""gay culture."" Those things didn't exist where I grew up, and the stuff I saw on television might have been taking place on Mars for all the relevance it had to me at the time (when I wasn't assuming it was stuff people just made up for television.) The couple bi/gay guys I knew were of the same mind, and we just pretty much did our own thing. The majority of that was just the same sorts of stuff other guys tended to do where we grew up, not any sort of ""gay identity."" By the time I even encountered that first hand, my personally was already pretty much set, and I don't have any real need to try to assimilate it."
askgaybros,3e02ip,Chris770,3,Tue Jul 21 03:06:17 2015 UTC,"I respect that.  I guess where I'm coming from I grew up being told I was not masculine enough because I was short, because I liked to read, because I was sensitive, because I didn't like sports . . . so when I hear ""masculine"" it's a very distancing thing for me.  Even for someone I could be friends with.  I did not grow up in the southern rural United States.  I grew up 1st gen Cuban American in South Florida and Hispanic machismo is its own brand of strange gender politics. Maybe we would get along, maybe not. But if someone's masculine means ""someone to get a beer with"" I'm your man.  If someone's masculine is tailgaiting a game, I'm not.    I'm not telling you to change.  I'm just reporting how it comes across to someone like myself.  And frankly, I RESPECT your candor and articulateness because any time I have tried to discuss this with a ""masc"" guy there is literally no discussion.  They just get frustrated.  I'd rather have a real conversation with someone where I can see their point of view and understand it even if I may diverge in places.  I also struggle with this terminology because my sexual tastes run to guys who are furry, bearded, and/or tattooed.  I'd like to share a bunch (but not all) of my common interests with them and they run the gamut (from weightlifting to reading to opera to superhero flicks) and I have no idea how to define the masculinity I am attracted to.    I generally do not respond to loud, flamboyant, overly groomed fashionista guys full of attitude and I wonder if that's the way I discriminate? I just feel like they are on another planet than I am.  But would I label them as fem?  What about the some scruffy hipster (one of the types I go nuts over) who likes to knit?  That doesn't bug me at all and I don't label that as fem.  It's a very tangled web."
askgaybros,3e02ip,AlejoHoots,3,Tue Jul 21 03:22:14 2015 UTC,"That's actually an interesting coincidence, I have a long time e-mail pal from Florida who's a Cuban American guy, and talking with him about this sort of thing ended up giving me a lot of insights. One of the things about him is that he considers himself a Cuban American man first, and a gay man as a distant second, in terms of his personal identity. He also spends most of his time working toward the concerns of his ethnic community (he's majoring in social work) and doesn't relate very well to most gay guys because most can't understand the stronger personal relevance of his ethnic culture for him. (Fortunately, he has a really great boyfriend who's shares that point of view.)  Even within the States, though, the relevance of different things varies a lot depending on where you are. Take high school football in the southern United States, for example. If you go to school in a district composed of spread out communities, you're generally expected to play if you're male and suited to it, and looked down on if you refuse to. (My first boyfriend of two years and I both played.) High school games have a high social relevance down there. They're considered community events, people will drive for a good half hour to attend them, and guys who play well are considered minor local heroes and even sometimes given a lot of slack and sort of doted on (provided they continue to win games.) Accomplishments with that did form part of my sense of identity, because they were important to me and the people around me. It was also something only guys did, so it has that context as well. On the other hand, high school football isn't so much paid attention to in the northern States, and isn't such a big deal. I wouldn't expect someone in Michigan to grasp the way in which that built up my sense of self growing up, though a guy's record is still his record anywhere, and it's still respected in some sense by anyone who understands what someone has to go through to earn it. (It's also a done deal once you have, and because you've got something to show for it anyone who claims it's a ""fake"" part of your identity just ends up looking like a fool.)"
askgaybros,3e02ip,Chris770,3,Tue Jul 21 04:36:59 2015 UTC,"I would so not have fit in your hometown.  I am not built for football. I honestly don't know if any team sport would have worked for me since I peaked at 5'2"" and I was skinny in high school (I've since packed on muscle). Also, growing up sports fans = homophobes who would harass me or try to beat me up, so I stayed away.  To this day, I see sports fans wearing jerseys on the subway and I move to the other end of the car.    I have a lesbian friend who is a big sports fan and she's one of my favorite people in the world and she's been wanting to write a book about LGBT kids who feel no connection to sports due to childhood/adolescence trauma.  I'm glad that there was peer pressure when I was in college to get muscles to get laid.  Twenty years later I love my workouts.  I inadvertently found an activity where I can ground myself in my body.   Your story about high school football shed more light on what sports mean for some people and thank you for sharing that.  Although it's not my experience at all, I really appreciate hearing how it worked for you.  As far as the Cuban thing.  Cubans were NOT SAFE growing up.  I was shamed constantly in my family.  CONSTANTLY.  I reowned my Cuban identity later in life but on my own terms and I still don't feel safe around a bunch of Latins unless they're all artistic.  I embraced an urbane gay identity because the stereotype of the effete, discriminating white dude living in Greenwich Village felt better than what I grew up with.  Sadly, I realized that was just a mirage and I don't fit in with that world either.  I have never fit into any of the tribes--bears/otters/cubs, faeries, theater fags, art fags, etc. I just sort of built my own over the years."
askgaybros,3e02ip,AlejoHoots,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:00:31 2015 UTC,"Well, it's not that every guy was expected to play football. It was more that, because our high school didn't have a huge number of students, guys pretty much got shanghaied into it if they were built for the game. Not having a playable team during any given season was genuinely unthinkable to the entire community, it really is that culturally important. Guys who obviously weren't suited to being out in the field weren't particularly looked down on for it, though occasionally someone would get roped into it purely to make numbers without being expected to be on the field much. It was more the case that people would take a dim view of you if you were suited to the game and refused to play. (Unfairly, some guys whose parents couldn't afford to hire help to make up for their absence on working farms during season were subjected to this by some people, but most were understanding enough about it.)  I will add that things would have been rather different if I'd been ""out"" during high school, which was something my parents (wisely, though I'm sure some people will disagree) strongly discouraged me from doing until I'd left for college. I had the extreme fortune of being raised by southern liberals, but they're were also very realistic. Our home was also a ""safe space"" for my boyfriend, whose parents were very Christian (the kind who make sure everyone else knows it) and rabid social conservatives. This ironically worked out well for him, as he was able to pass himself off as a devout ""no sex until marriage"" protestant and even earned social points for it among the Christian ""cool kids"" crowd. (Though it was extremely frustrating for various girls doing the obsessed-over-cute-but-unavailable-guy thing.) For my own part, being bisexual, nobody ever really questioned me on anything. I'd gained a semi-deserved reputation among girls for being sort of a cad by the age of 16 anyway. (I have no real defense for my roguish behavior, other than having been especially horny and rather socially stupid about it when I started dating, but a lot of that did get exaggerated by others.)  Some people misinterpret the tendency of guys to push their male friends toward being the best possible version of themselves as being something shallow. Though it does involve peer pressure, and I've been plenty ""guilty"" of that, it's not a way I act toward other guys I don't genuinely like. It's more the case that other members of your ""pack"" are indirectly (socially) representative of you, and that you have a stake in making sure they do it well. People who look on this from the outside sometimes think it's an unhealthy thing, though it's generally anything but (admittedly, occasional stupidity does occur, but often gets blown out of proportion.)  I don't really fit into any ""tribe"" either, and I don't really care to. I spent less than a month trying to ""re-invent"" myself along those lines during my first year of college, before it dawned on me how ridiculous and contrived my behavior was and I jettisoned that baggage. I'm simply not willing to twist myself in knots trying to conform to anyone's categories for the sake of their convenience. Being in a long term relationship, I have no real motive to mollify anyone over their preconceptions, and any grumbling over my refusal to do that is that person's problem rather than mine."

Overly clean, can't walk out of the house without being semi dressed up, would never be caught camping, and are absolutely clueless when it comes to basic home and car maintenance.

askgaybros,3e02ip,midwesternliberal,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:14:56 2015 UTC,"Well yeah, because concepts of gender identity are inextricably tied to larger cultures, so that certainly does differ depending on your cultural origins. Most people who haven't lived in rural America really don't grasp that it's a very different social and cultural environment, and there are things which are very culturally important to them which are meaningless to us, and vice versa.  This doesn't fail to apply if you're bi/gay, and people don't often grasp how much culture shock is involved when people like us first come into contact with the mainly urban-centric ""gay community."" I still keep in touch with the first guy I was ever involved with, during high school, and he refers to us as the ""free range organic"" variety. He's also of a pretty similar mind about not desiring to ""integrate"" into mainstream big city ""gay culture."""

My idea of this comes from when I was a kid, (long before I knew what gay was) looking up to my father, uncles, other male relatives, boys I went to school with and male TV and movie personalities who I liked and admired.   I don't know if this has anything to do with anything, but I most imprinted on my dad when I was a kid, wanting to know everything he knew and do everything he did. He was my biggest hero and we have always been very close. I also always enjoyed spending much more time with the male figures in my family, doing typical guy things and rarely with female figures in my family doing what they were interested in doing.   When I finally got around to figuring out and accepting my sexual orientation, immersing myself in the gay community, it was seen and expressed as a positive and attractive thing among the guys I met, so I saw no reason to change anything.   It's only been since social media and gay dating apps took off that I ever knew about anyone expressing any different feelings about the matter."

I've embraced the voice because I think it's just a college educated urban thing (Even most straight men I know talk that way)... and hell, I wouldn't tell a black person to modulate their voice to sound ""white"" or a Long Island Jew to try and pass as an old moneyed WASP."

When immature and vain people have their advances rejected, they immediately try to rationalize some reason for why the ""fault"" is with the other person in order to salve a bruised ego. If they're really immature, they may even open up their mouth and attempt to target vomit their conclusions toward you as some sort of personal attack. Keeping in mind that'd exactly what's going on, it becomes nothing other than mildly annoying and humorous.  Some people with their own issues also get ""triggered"" by encountering gay/bi guys with a masculine gender identity. They'll begin feebly attempting to use that person, who they have almost no personal experience with and know nearly nothing of, as some sort of punching bag to vent their issues. Occasionally they will calm down enough to explain their behavior, and sometimes their reasoning is pretty surprising. There was a guy I had a class with who, after most of the semester had passed with him being snarky and abrasive after having an advance rejected by me, finally explained himself at the urging of mutual friend who didn't understand his behavior. His reason was that I reminded him greatly of people who'd picked on him during high school, and he felt that me being gay (I never cared enough to explain to him that I'm actually bisexual) somehow caused me to become a moving violation of his ""safe space."" (This is the Cliff's Notes version of it, deciphered from the midst of a lot of rambling.) As much as I appreciated him finally being honest about it, he wasn't able to understand that I'd never been part of those memories which were screwing with him, and it still made him seem pretty addled (along with the fact that he'd tried to flirt with me in the first place, given that's the effect I had on him just by existing.)"

On a message board like this;   one has just as much right to share what turns them on as anyone else does. There isn't any need to add what turns them off about those who don't turn them on, unless one of those people  ask them about that and then the person who asks shouldn't get mad because they got an honest answer they don't like to their question.

Those people then take it personally and believe that because their gender is being called into question, it leads to defensive mechanisms.  It's basically a huge mess in society and has features of glorification that I believe are baseless and pointless. Who cares about how people act? It's not really any of our business how others choose to live their lives, or how they were born. The same goes for people who complain and flame about feminine or masculine guys; it really just perpetuates stereotypes and further ostracizes communities of people."
askgaybros,3e02ip,oskietje,3,Tue Jul 21 03:07:42 2015 UTC,"In American society being gay is the antithesis of being manly, so guys who are out already feel at a disadvantage. If you're already feeling like an outcast and one of your own (another gay man) says he only likes masculine guys, I think that makes guys feel even more rejected.  The other problem is that you can't help who you're attracted to, so we have to find some middle ground. Or make up a new word to get the 'masculine' thing across."
askgaybros,3e02ip,AchBaer,3,Tue Jul 21 04:03:39 2015 UTC,"Personally, I'm attracted to men because of their masculinity.  I find masculine traits attractive because I feel like I lack many myself.

askgaybros,3e02ip,ssnobele,10,Tue Jul 21 04:28:10 2015 UTC,"A lot of this being a ""big deal"" is rooted in how masculinity in general is treated within the gay community. Masculine (white) gay men that easily pass as straight are held as the most appropriate and most sexually-valuable type of gay man. This is easily backed up by what type of gay porn is consistently most popular (Sean Cody, Corbin Fisher, etc) and by how society at large behaves. As the gay community still exists within this general society, we reproduce a lot of the same norms and standards (ie. white heteronormativity). Many scholars and theorists argue that masculinity being held on a pedestal the way it is in the gay community is a product of these already existing fucked up norms.   So when we have a gay community, which began as a sexually liberated, radical resistance to the rest of society, subverting femininity and feminine gay men it does in fact become a big deal as many gay men are feminine or at least have feminine aspects. I am NOT saying that not being attracted to fem gays is directly discriminating against them, but rather that it is linked to this larger problem. Beyond this, cutting out an entire portion of the gay community because of 1 trait is open to doubt (thats a nice way of saying ""problematic""). This goes for all ""no fem's, no blacks, no fatties, etc"" statements.  When I spent most of my younger years being bullied in school for being feminine, when I quit playing the sport I had loved and played for 10 years because my varsity coach constantly made fun of me for being feminine, when I hated myself more for being feminine than for being gay and then I hear another gay man say he is not attracted to feminine men yes it does hurt and yes it is a big deal because I have had to deal with that bullshit all my life.   --not trying to start an argument or get pity points, simply trying to answer OP's question from my perspective--"
askgaybros,3e02ip,Proud_Fag,2,Tue Jul 21 02:19:21 2015 UTC,"Lol how did we venture into the porn industry now. I read your post though and i think its important to recognize things that have happened in our lives that change us. I have been sexually molested when I was younger by two men so I dont like men touching and feeling on me and complementing my physique as a form of flirtation. I know that about myself, its also why when i express that I am not interested in somebody one time and they dont let it go it makes me want to knock the shit out of them. Its also why i do not like being hit on in an aggressive sexual eye fucking manner as well.  That is violent as hell but i think its only because for me it triggers the fact that they are not comprehending what ""NO"" means. Thank you for letting us know why being turned down for being feminine pisses you off though with what you described your highschool experience like it makes sense.  I think its important to try not to visit our own personal hang ups on other people though if it can be helped."
askgaybros,3e02ip,Gaybrothrowaway222,3,Tue Jul 21 03:19:11 2015 UTC,"Porn is a rather large part of the gay community as we are a sexual minority. Gay porn can be seen as a reflection of what gay men are sexually attracted to so we can draw that popular porn is representative of popular sexual interests. I bring up porn also because for many young gay boys, the internet (usually gay porn) is the first look at the gay world and is a part of our socialization and development as gay people because again we are a sexual minority.   The reason I mentioned what I had to go through is because my story is very common with feminine gay men. And thats the whole point, this is something that most feminine gays have to constantly endure from a very young age and we get it from straight people and from gay people. Effemophobia is bigger than just a ""personal hang up"" because it has become integrated into the gay community and the rest of society. Typically masculine spaces, like sports, are almost never accepting of feminine men which is stupid because things like sports are only masculine because we make it that way. It is a very different experience than what masculine gay men go through and is why ""not being attracted to feminine gays"" is such a big deal because it extends beyond sexual attraction. Femininity is held in many ways as lesser than masculinity in the gay community and in the rest of our society. This is supported by many scholars and theorists. (There's entire fields dedicated to this kind of work aka Feminist Studies, Queer Theory, Sexuality Studies etc)  Because when an entire portion of the gay community is repeatedly deemed as not attractive/sexually valuable/whatever because of one factor, femininity, it is a problem. And this happens in regards to race, gender expression, sexuality, and many other aspects of peoples' identity.   =]  I also agree with you, the importance of consent and being told No are an issue with the gay community as well."
askgaybros,3e02ip,Proud_Fag,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:26:44 2015 UTC,"I would probably argue too that how much of the effemphobia is a reflection that we live in a misogynist society and gay men internalize that.  Not to mention, in our childhoods we may get mixed signals.  A kid who may not be into sports but isn't exactly drag queen material may get the message from family that they are not ""masculine"" because he's not performing his masculinity the way THEY deem proper even though he's definitely masculine.  He may just be into reading or video games or music or tech or god knows what else.  But the damage is done and that kid grows up feeling they fall short of this masculine ideal.    I've also known gay men who are tall, built, powerful and get annoyed when men project this alpha/protector thing onto them and they are not seen as well-rounded people.  Often they are pegged as tops and many of them really want to be vers and feel they have a hard time finding relationships and friendships where they can be vulnerable and share their feelings.  It reminds me not to judge books by their covers."
askgaybros,3e02ip,AlejoHoots,2,Tue Jul 21 12:28:15 2015 UTC,"Lol how did we venture into the porn industry now.   Oh boy.. porn is actually the big elephant in the room when it comes to this. I don't know how many wacky social theories I've heard people come up with to explain why almost all gay porn actors are decidedly masculine, yet those studios would have no trouble finding more effeminate gay men to hire if people would actually buy the result. The furthest toward that most producers have been able to go and still make money of it has been ""twink"" porn, and even that doesn't end up doing very well.  Presumably gay/bi guys avoid watching porn with effeminate actors because we've been ""programmed"" not to somehow, even though people mainly watch porn in the privacy of their own homes and largely don't seek the approval of others to even do so in the first place. Maybe we need tinfoil hats."

Especially if you get into a situation where you're trading pics/videos.    I do know a porn actor who is mega cute.  He's in his 40s, dresses like  an artsy nerd, loves theater, is well read, etc. When I am in his presence I am attracted to him.  I've seen his photos and films and everything I find hot about him is stripped away.  Yeah he has a hot body and a big dick, but all the SPARK is gone.    I do have to wonder though because when I have sex my testosterone goes way up and I start grunting and growling and my voice lowers  and words like ""man,"" ""dude,"" ""bro,"" ""fuck yeah!"" come out of my mouth.  Most guys I sleep with do the same thing.  I have no idea if it's because of porn or whether that has always been my natural state and porn tends to allow me access to that.  At this point, I see having great sex as a gift I do not question anymore as long as I feel safe and connected and sane, I don't question it so much."

He seriously regrets having done that, not because it was uncomfortable or it didn't pay well, but because he's years later still having to occasionally send DMCA take down letters to sites where video captures people made keep popping up. I do really like amateur porn, but knowing what an aggravation that's been for him I feel creepy watching it unless I've got reason to be pretty sure the people in those really want them distributed. At least with professional porn there's no question about that.  The downside is that, especially with gay studio porn, most of it is woefully unimaginative (though there are rare exceptions.) My girlfriend actually has a very funny take on it, in that she could tell someone how to produce gay ""porn"" which women would love to watch.. it just wouldn't be something most gay guys would want to see. According to her, all you'd have to do is find a couple cute guys who actually like each other and have them cuddle, make out and goof off together in cute ways. It wouldn't even require any actual sex or nudity, just near toxic levels of cuteness. If she's right, I have this funny mental image of women buying that up in droves while gay guys look bewildered and scratch their heads over it. Her main complaint about porn in general is that the actors rarely ever have any ""chemistry"" or even really like each other much, which according to her is impossible to fake.

I understand that concepts of masculinity and femininity have very little meaning for you, but they do have a great deal of meaning for others, and being ""anti"" about it will be perceived as an attack. Because gender identity is inextricably linked to a person's ethnic culture, it's very often impossible to attack their self-identity in this sense without indirectly attacking their ethnic culture at the same time. Some people don't understand that, or why it tends to anger people they do that to.  Also, not everyone cares to do the whole ""deconstructing gender"" thing, and I'm someone who unabashedly refuses to do that, with myself or anyone else."

I usually just skip over them because I just worry there's a whole can of worms I don't want to open there, but it bugs the hell out of me that I have no idea whether to approach that person (if I was attracted to them) or not.

If that's too complex for you, which for many people it is, it would probably be best to stick within your own.

Really cool guy, obsessed with bodybuilding, great sense of humor (once I mastered his accent) and a real demon in bed (in a good way!) Also learned the proper way of drinking vodka (though we Americans apparently make terrible vodka.) According to him, he'd been on a couple other trips to the States and never had any luck finding gay guys here he even wanted to hang out with. The difference was I actually looked past my own nose and took an interest in who he was and where he was from, rather than just going ""Ooh, hot Russian guy!"" (Well, I thought that too, of course.) He also found effeminate gay men to be a very (literally) foreign concept, mostly because it wasn't a version of femininity he was familiar with even in women where he was from. With me, he at least had someone to go to the campus fitness center with (I carded him in as a guest) and he didn't feel any need to try to Americanize himself to relate to me."

Those things aren't separable, and even if you don't consciously realize that you're demeaning someone else's cultural and social background in the process, they're still going to get pissed off.

askgaybros,3e02ip,Chris770,-2,Tue Jul 21 06:49:52 2015 UTC,"Well even we gay guys have been fed the same generic stereotypes of the media\TV\Movie industry over the years. The majority of gays who get roles or even a platform to speak are those who the media thinks are the most odd and most interesting to feature for the sake of ratings etc.   This doesn't count those who (not elected) but have merely self appointed themselves to be the so called leaders of the gay community and who like zealot right wing Christians evangelize their ideas, theories etc., and out of peer pressure practice PC group-think in order to keep their high standing among their peers.  It's very easy to fall for the ideology of those saying only things they know we like to hear and who don't have the guts to bring up and speak of things that are more true, more important, but only less popular.  Maybe one day people will wake up and quit allowing themselves to be led around by their noses and accept the fact that equal rights are for everyone, not just gay people or a select group within the gay community."

This isn't a thing which only takes place among gay guys either. Try asking any lesbian who's too overtly feminine how much flak they take from other lesbians who decide to reject that as part of some crusade. Bisexual women especially end up putting up with a huge amount of nonsense over this sort of thing, and it's ended up creating a huge social rift between the lesbian and bisexual communities."
askgaybros,3e02ip,Chris770,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:18:17 2015 UTC,"I know.   This kind of thing effects every culture who has been on the outcasts list at one time or another, where someone or some few decide to take advantage of the situation and appoint themselves the leaders.   I'm not saying that it's not a good thing. Someone needs to make a stand in order to try and change things, but all to often it goes to the heads of the self appointed and the followers who buy into everything help to feed their fame misguided egos.   Maybe if there were elections, with debates etc., and term limits for so called gay leaders we could at least take some personal responsibility for ourselves rather than blindly allow others do our thinking for us and only pay lip service to what they tell us to think.   Oh, we already do that with the government, so maybe it's not that great of an idea either lol!"

Most of the actual work which supports LGBT concerns is done ""behind the scenes"" by sorts of people who're only interested in what makes shit happen, and don't care much about being publically recognized, in a way which is relatively thankless and not very glamorous. Quite a few of those people aren't even gay or bisexual, and many have done far more than people who march in parades or wave signs around at demonstrations a few times a year ever have.  You also do not much find this sort of nonsense in those circles, as it's all on a volunteer basis (often with not enough volunteers) and nobody can afford to alienate the people they need to do actual work with over trivialities."

Realize that fem guys can't help but stand out for going against gender norms in their looks and mannerisms. They were the face of the gay community in the past when no one else is visible. Now that being gay is more socially accepted and we're seeing more fluidity and style in the gay community like ""straight-acting"" guys (full disclosure: I hate this term and used it only for comparison), fem guys are being rejected and marginalized even further by a community that once embraced them. I think that is why it is such a big deal when fem guys are rejected by masc guys, because they're not just rejecting them on a sexual level, but also on a platonic and sometimes human level."
askgaybros,3e02ip,omgindigo,2,Tue Jul 21 02:19:18 2015 UTC,"I guess the issue isn't so much about fem or masculine guys is it is about the superiority complex some guys have when it comes to feminine guys. the guys who say ""masc4masc no fems"" and act as if they're somehow better than a feminine guy may be what sets these guys off. funny enough, half the time these guys aren't that masculine in person lol."

I'm comfortable in my own skin, and if someone isn't attracted to the skin I live in--that's fine. In the same way, if someone isn't attracted to some personality trait I possess--that's fine too. It goes both ways. I've never been attracted to feminine traits or flamboyance, and that has nothing to do with internalized homophobia, it has to do with what I find sexually attractive and what I don't. I don't find women sexually attractive, nor traits that I generally associate with female behavior. I know what appeals to me and what doesn't.  It's only a big deal when people make it about identity politics. And you can choose whether or not you want to let them steer it in that direction. The moment I start to get the sense someone is trying to make it out to be more than it is, I disengage, and let them know that the situation or conversation isn't suitable to my tastes and I walk away."

I mean that would just be dishonest in the first place.  Thats why i cant fathom why ppl considers it racist.  I try not to be a hypocrit like the guy you mentioned though.

Yeah i think your probably attracted to not white per sey but lighter skin tones and thats not preference its just what you personally like.

If im not attracted to super macho men that does not mean i hate and am repulsed by them or deem them less than me.  People act like attraction is something that can be controlled when it is what comes ""naturally"" meaning without being forced so if i am not attracted to feminine men im not and nothing can make me. That does not mean i see them as less value beneath me or hate them.  The reason this irritates me is because people cannot leave it at that they keep saying im the problem or the guy whos not forcing himself to like something he just naturally doesnt like is the problem thats why these discussions get heated."

There's a difference between having a ""preference"" and outright rejecting everyone that doesn't meet said preference. While I would say I'm generally attracted to masculine features but I would never preemptively limit my available options by putting ""masc"" only in my Grindr profile. You could be surprised who you end up being attracted to or falling for. Which is where my problem with profiles that outright reject certain men or races come from. It shows an unwillingness to consider new things or people.   After all, isn't keeping an open mind a good trait for everyone to have? We already deal with enough people unwilling to exit their comfort zone just because of the fact we're gay, no reason to act the same ourselves."

I also think the same thing about people who use words like ""pansexual"" or ""queer"", so any phobia is wider than biphobia. To be honest, I think gays who hide behind the notion of bisexuality have homophobia issues. I think it's worthwhile and healthy for the gay community to look at bisexuals with scepticism because so many of them turn out to be really gay. The idea of young men turning to bisexuality as a stepping stone is understandable, I suppose, but it seems wrong-headed and uphelpful to me.  However, the closet is actually a big house with many rooms. And I do agree that sexuality is complex."

(Because if these studies are done, I'll change my views.)  I'm sorry this view upsets you so much, but this discussion would be a lot easier if it wasn't met with such anger and histrionics. You don't have to attack me personally. Perhaps I was one of the many who told everyone he was ""bi"" for many years, only to later come fully out of the closet. You simply don't know enough about my situation to attack me personally.   You understand that when the concept of bisexuality is challenged, it's not a personal challenge against the credibility of anyone in particular. It's a discussion about what is really happening out there.  I do believe sexuality is essentially binary. Show me the science indicating that it's not. I also feel sexuality is fluid and complex. That doesn't change its essentially binary nature. This whole idea of pansexuality was invented by a handful of American lesbian academics in the 1990s. It's just political bullshit, in my view. There are now hundreds of academics who have been hanging their careers on this very flimsy concept.  To anyone who says he is bi because he is ""only 90% into men"": I'm sorry, you're just gay. Deal with it.  If you're 10% into men, you're just straight.  There may be a very small minority of men who are truly 100% into men and 100% into women. They are true bisexuals, I suppose. I imagine they number in the dozens, worldwide. Who knows? No one, apparently."

Maybe you'll gain some insight to how insane you sound.     You deserve the tone of my posts. Don't you see how isolating your views are, especially to people in need like the OP? You are trying to rob people of their identity by dismissing it. You treat bisexuals in the way many straight people treated gays years ago. I dread what you must think of transsexuals.   It always disgusts me to run into a member of the gay community who has such ludicrous opinions on a pretty academically settled subject. Who cares if YOU used bisexuality as a shield for your insecurities? That doesn't make it true for everyone. Stop projecting.  Keep your insane conspiracies to yourself before you hurt someone.

I never used the term ""bisexuality"" to describe myself (although I had a full and active heterosexual sex life when I was in the closet). You apparently were unable to understand my point about this. I was just presenting that as a scenario. My point is that you are attacking me personally for making this point. There's no point in doing that because you don't know me personally. I'm presenting a view that is held by many gay men.  I'm helping the OP by letting him know (perhaps) what his brother is thinking. It's quite possible his brother sees quite clearly that the OP is using the ""bi"" identity as a stepping stone. Perhaps the brother is wrong. I don't know. The OP could be a true bisexual. Who knows.  The articles you linked have been around for a while and present nothing new. This has been discussed before. I'm not convinced that scientists agree on this. There is a single solid study, dating from last year. It's at least one solid indication, but it would help if it were backed up by other studies. And it would also help if gay men stopped hiding behind the ""bi"" identity. It's disrespectful to the rest of us. There is nothing shameful about being gay. No need to pretend to be bi.  I would need to see a definition of bisexuality before discussing this any further."

If you think ONE study has been done in the last year, you need to rereread my second link (the NYT article) and read again what some other posters are linking to. I guess it's easier to be in denial.   I am almost afraid to ask what you must think of trans people. You're like a car wreck I can't look away from.  Your post history here is insulting. Don't be surprised people are upset. Don't play stupid. You aren't fooling anyone.  Nothing shameful about being gay? You're right. Nothing shameful about being bi either, you raging hypocrite.

Reading between the lines, you're admitting that this phenomenon happens. Look at this sub. Dozens of posters every week saying they are ""bi"". It's just easier for them.    I don't deny them the right to do this, by the way. I explained that a few posts back.

It was not considered an important subject for a very long time, given that human sexuality wasn't something easy to secure funding for for good deal of history. When Kinsey started research on sexuality, there was clear room for bisexuality (hence the Kinsey scale). His early methodology can be easily and perhaps understandably criticized, but so much more has happened in sexuality research since then.

Even the Wikipedia page says that, more or less.  The science is weak because there are not enough studies explaining what is going on when it comes to bisexuality (or homosexuality, for that matter). Where is the science?  Until we have some objective evidence the bi phenomenon is no more real than the Kingdom of God.  Perhaps you're right. Perhaps true bisexuality (whatever that is) really exists, and it's not some dysfunctional, wobbly offshoot of the homosexuality phenomenon. And perhaps in the future, it will be comprehensively studied, and we will know what is really going on out there.  But we're not there yet. All we have now are many, many, many young men claiming to be ""bi"" when they later admit they were gay all along.

Anyway, I'll answer your specific questions:   What is the gay community like -is it welcoming?   I think /u/abrozzi hit the nail on the head: LA's gay scene is kind of superficial. There are plenty of young professionals in LA who are gay, though, so I think you'll probably blend in pretty well in that regard.   Good variety of people?   Yeah, I would say so. It sounds cliche, but you can meet people from all different walks of life in the Los Angeles area.   Lots to do?   Yes, but you should have a car. Don't rely exclusively on public transportation.   How is dating - is it easy to find decent guys and have stable relationships, especially with someone my age?   It's probably not going to be easy for you to find a ""stable relationship"" with another gay guy at age 23. There aren't many gay guys your age who are looking to settle down, at least not in my experience. I'm 27 now, and the older I get, the more guys I know who are looking to settle down. When I was in my early twenties and trying to find a serious relationship with another man, I had a difficult time.   Also, how does one make friends and meet people?   Probably the same way you made friends in Seattle. Talk to coworkers. Go to meetup groups. Find LGBT-related organizations in your area. That kind of thing."

The great news is that if you ever want to fly back to Seattle, you have over 30 nonstop flights to choose from (LAX, Orange County, Burbank, Long Beach, and Ontario).  LA has any kind of food you'd ever want.  One of my tips for getting used to a new place is to visit the grocery store at popular shopping hours.

As others have said, the traffic in and out of Santa Monica is absolutely brutal; so do find a place to live near your work: in Santa Monica, Venice or Brentwood. To get a sense of the geography of the Westside, visit the Getty museum and take in the stunning vistas from their gardens. (Uber up there unless you enjoy parking garage hell.)  If you are looking for a social outlet that is off the radar, consider contacting a group called Under the Bridges that prepares and distributes meals for the homeless one Saturday a month, often more.

I personally found it to be a little too stereotypically gay for my personal taste but there definitely are gay guys there (And all over) that are more chill and not so into going to loud clubs and watching gogo boys dance all night. L.A. is a melting pot of many different types of people and cultures. Silver Lake has a pretty big gay population, but Silver Lake in general is pretty hipster/indie music/alternative whatever else you want to call it. So if that's your style, you'll definitely want to check out that area. I personally have had a very hard time with dating. I don't enjoy going to the gay parts of town, i always feel really out of place there. So i mostly have straight male and female friends. So i haven't had many dating prospects. Eventually i need to just bite the bullet and go to West Hollywood more often, but i hate feeling like it's my only option. I want to be able to meet guys through mutual friends or just randomly in public or at work without it having to be a place that is specifically gay like straight people can. That's just me personally though. If you are into gay culture or the gay scene at all in the slightest, you'll be perfectly happy. There are tons of things to do here depending on what you like to do. Any musician you like is almost guaranteed to come through L.A. at least once on every tour or especially during music festival season in the summer. Bowling alleys are everywhere. Bars (of all kinds) are everywhere. Being active is a big thing here. So there's lots of people who hike, bike, walk, run, job, go to the gym or anything physical. There's a place for it. Lot's of different kinds of food. L.A. is also a foodie paradise. Sushi, indian, thai, chinese, mexican, italian, pizza, burgers, seafood in general.

And maybe you're right that I should sort through things a bit first. I realized that I'd put the idea of being in a relationship on this giant pedestal, and once I was actually on a date, it didn't feel like a big deal at all. Maybe it's just because I didn't click with the guy, who knows. I also am really not a fan of the whole online dating setup, but that's neither here nor there. But I do know Matt and I just weren't meant to be, so it's all right. If anything, I kind of want to take the boost of confidence this gave me and run with it. I don't think I'll be looking to go on any more spontaneous dates with people I met online, but I am going to be more open with people I meet in real life. I think that a large part of why Friday ended up knocking me on my ass is because I didn't say anything earlier. I'd already let it fester, and it became so much more than what it was.

Consequently, sufferers of depression may attempt to distance themselves from those they care about. Your ex boyfriend could have been doing just this and forcing emotional distance between you two as a means to further isolate himself.   My advice to you would be to remain in his life as much possible, but as a friend. He needs to know you're there for him despite his depression.   Either that or he truly has become callous and no longer has romantic feelings towards you. If that is the case, don't allow his selfish behavior to ruin your happiness; poor mental health doesn't excuse asshole behavior and your happiness is important too.  Source: I battled depression"

Your body is going to be using muscle mass to heal after strenuous workouts, in using protein drinks the idea is that the body will use that and lessen the rate of catabolism. However your average person going to the gym isn't going to be exercising to the extent that they'll need to really worry about muscle catabolism. An average, well-balanced diet will suffice. If you're really worried throw in an extra serving of a protein into it. Honestly if you can plan out your meals half-decently you can likely get the amount of protein in a RTD shake for cheaper.

If you honestly think you may have contracted HIV then go get PEP if it's within the first 72 hours. Regardless go get yourself checked out and stop obsessing.

It costs around $55-70 ish depending on what area you live in.  Look online, their website will say they do male Brazilians or you can call and ask.  You will need an appointment anyways so they will know it is for a guy.  The first appointment often costs maybe $10 more and takes longer.  After that most places lower the cost as long as you don't wait longer than 4 weeks or so because then the hair gets too long (they call it a 'maintenance appointment').  Lastly, if you go, pay attention to their preparation instructions for the day before the appointment (makes it less painful), and after-care.  Also, you will need at least 1/4inches of hair for sugaring/waxing to be possible so if you are already smooth now you will need to wait a while before sugaring.  Enjoy!"

The first appointment cost a little bit more ~$60 (though you probably want to tip the person ripping hair out of your privates with hot, sticky stuff) and the second was ~$40. That was for balls/most of front/back. There was way less hair to deal with the second time.  I opted for sugar because it doesn't burn your skin like wax does. It'll be a bit sensitive for about a day. And I maybe got one or two pimples. It takes two or three times to get rid of all 3 hair cycles and then you're supposed to come in every ~4(?) weeks to maintain that. The new hairs are super soft in the meantime. So very different from shaving.  My provider had plenty of male clients who'd go in for intimate regions, chest, back, whatever.  I stopped doing it because my boyfriend didn't care either way, the provider was out of the way, and it didn't seem like a necessary expense. Having perfectly smooth balls was awesome, so I might do it again sometime. Plus, I didn't need to use nearly as much toilet paper to come away clean."
askgaybros,3dyv96,Necks,2,Mon Jul 20 21:43:34 2015 UTC,"Shave with a female razor and use a decent shave cream. To prevent ingrown hairs/irritation and make your pubic area smooth in general, use a BHA (salicylic acid) lotion. Beta hydroxy acid very gently exfoliates the inside of your pores and I apply it right after using the female razor (has some moisturizing pads or some crap on it). I can be hairless without getting bumpy, irritated skin and razor burn that makes my crotch look like a pubescent teen's face."

askgaybros,3dzrw9,hornyfckr,7,Mon Jul 20 21:17:26 2015 UTC,"Psycho doms and subs are the real downside in BDSM.  I'm into SM and a lot of the guys (subs mostly, but also doms) who approach me are just... crazy.  Before long they're talking about me permanently mutilating them, or they have no sense of boundaries, or they don't know what the hell they want.  Doms can also go crazy and assume that, without it even being solicited or negotiated, that the I will accept anything or want to become his total slave.  All I really want is a sane young man, with boundaries and self-respect, whose dick goes hard when I hurt him, and who wants to return the favour.  I long ago gave up trying to do BDSM with hookups.  Too many of the guys are just crazy in a bad way.  I only do BDSM with guys I'm already friends with, I've found in practice that your best bet is often with ""normal"" guys who have a kinky/rough side, if you've got any friends with benefits you can often open up about this with them and you might be surprised how far they'll go if you have a bond with them.  My last boyfriend was a slightly kinky vanilla dude when I met him but took to hardcore masochism like a fish to water once we came to trust each other.  To do it properly requires enormous amounts of trust and understanding of the other person, that takes time and and investment and I've learned the hard way that nothing can substitute for those things.  My advice is that you should both vet your prospective dom/sub together even if you will play separately.  Have him over for drinks, maybe a vanilla-ish threesome, maybe have him over for dinner and movie night.  Get to know him, see if you're both comfortable with him and if he's comfortable and respectful of you two and your boundaries."
askgaybros,3dzrw9,indomante,4,Mon Jul 20 21:47:05 2015 UTC,"It's refreshing to see someone who understands that there is a lot of variation among specific kinks, it's a fairly rare thing to find someone who grasps that. A lot of people are so obsessed with their particular ""ritual"" that they reflexively respond to anyone they find doing things differently, or with different motivations, with a ""you are doing it wrong"" attitude. To me, that's very off-putting.  Our girlfriend (poly semi-triad) is very much into CFNM, but has been told she's ""doing it wrong"" because it's not a dominance thing for her (which apparently some people, particularly other women, think it should be.) In her case, she's just very much into appreciating the male form in an aesthetic sense, and gets a thrill out of seeing others be comfortably and casually nude. (She feels it's a profound expression of self-confidence, and that's a thing which is mightily attractive to her.) Others have insisted that it should involve subservience and humiliation, but for her either would completely destroy the experience. There is a slight objectification aspect to it though, in that she likes to sometimes view us as ""beautifully primitive creatures"" who she's free to openly enjoy the ""fully natural"" appearance of for the pure pleasure of it, but that's not really even trying to place anyone on a ""pet"" level. There's also a certain rebellion aspect to it, in that she likes to defy the social expectation that women shouldn't find the male body overly appealing. Understanding all that, we're quite happy to indulge her."
askgaybros,3dzrw9,Chris770,2,Mon Jul 20 22:57:39 2015 UTC,"Oh man I hate that ritual thing/rejection of different motivations. I sometimes get major hostility for being a sadist who isn't really into the domination/master role. If anything I'm the slightly more submissive guy outside of the bedroom/dungeon. It's not about domination for me.  I think (consensual and mostly sane) violence is sexy, and I enjoy pushing my sub into an altered state of consciousness through pain, that head space is just amazing.  Apparently it's some great upending of the natural order of the universe to want to whip your boy, but not want to lead him around on a leash or make him serve you breakfast. Yeesh."
askgaybros,3dzrw9,indomante,2,Mon Jul 20 23:26:30 2015 UTC,"Hell, I swear some people develop genuinely religious attitudes toward their particular practices, and some conversations on kink and fetish subs can be like watching people of different religious denominations arguing over doctrinal minutiae. (Which I admit can be funny as hell to read, but still..)  There's another parallel concerning what you're describing with the crazies in BDSM culture and similar people who hang around the fringe of the poly community. The whole reason for the concept of ""tribe"" and ""keeping it in the tribe"" is that you get quite a few people approaching poly for the sake of nothing more than fulfilling some particular fantasy or kink, who aren't even really interested in being involved in a poly relationship. (People with cuckold fantasies are extremely common.) It's not that there's anything wrong with kink or fetish in poly relationships, but those people I'm talking about aren't even seeking that, and they often seem to have severe issues of one sort or another."

Weve been mainly travelling, but when we settle down we will definitely but some effort into finding a regular Dom for my SO to see once a month or so.  Theres any number of Doms who as assholes, just like in dating. If he finds a good Dom who wants to play on a regular basis, hold onto him. Many doms who value a long term relationship with their sub, and will make the effort to communicate to the subs partner are already taken.... again its like finding quality LTR dating material.

askgaybros,3e0cwi,oskietje,2,Tue Jul 21 21:31:58 2015 UTC,"Being a homoromantic demisexual myself, I can tell you it's bad enough.  It's bad enough when you lack a primary sex drive. People just don't usually ""get"" that, and don't understand that you will not be driven by your hormones to hump everything that moves, and will only be able to have sex with someone you love, at which point you will actually be attracted to them.  Completely lacking a sexual attraction is even worse, because most people expect a sexual component to their significant relationships. Since asexuals have no sexual attraction whatsoever, and most don't even feel comfortable even having sex, it's usually extremely difficult to make anything other than a friendship work, and as we all know, life without love is usually boring as f**k.  @OP: I'm over your target demographic, and not a pure asexual, but I can relate. Hang in there, it's possible to find someone. I managed to find a good plain gay guy that's OK with my low sex drive. I'm sure you'll find someone to make it work with :D Hugs from Portugal."

If she's wanted a real answer, she might have asked if you think any guys she knows are ""cute,"" or whether you have a secret boyfriend, or if there's someone in particular you'd like to be dating.  There's nothing at all wrong with just finding someone fun to look at. Sex as a friendly thing is all fine and good between adults, as long as those involved understand that's what it is. Romantic relationships between guys can also take any number of forms, some of which are nothing close to ""traditional,"" and they're all valid so long as they make those involved happy.

You did what you felt you had to after trying hard to keep it going the way you were doing it, so nobody can fault you for being exhausted from doing that.

But truth is these are all empty shells of promises with no certainty of fulfillment. Unless you are willing to get back with him and figure a way out to make the distance between you not an issue, don't lead him on to something else. Hope is a painful thing to leave an ex lover after a break up. He deserves a better guy who would fight for him no matter what.  You know the thing is when he says he's happy, he's not. If he tells you he's okay, he's not. If he says he can live staying friends with you, he can't. Yes, he's heartbroken. But there is no other way to show, as an ex bf and ex bff, that you care for his feelings other than leaving him alone. He's hurt, and he's gotta heal. Yes, you might not see him again. But it's the best for him. The medicine to a broken heart is time and space. (Lol)  If you can't fight the distance, you did the right thing to just break it off. Move on. It's killing you, you also deserve someone to have regular physical connection with. If not, and when time comes when wounds have healed, and you could start all over again, then good for you then.

askgaybros,3e0wv1,tsktsk96,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:58:14 2015 UTC,From my experience just going for lunch and then a movie is a pretty ideal first date. You can chat and get to know the guy over lunch and if there's no connection there then you can always bail after the meal. If there is then you can make a little move in the cinema like a hand hold or something. It's a nice way to rest the waters and if things go well you can always go in for a kiss. But if you just want to do one or the other then lunch/dinner is the best option. You're not gonna learn anything about a guy if you're sitting in silence for 2 hours. The key to a first date is getting to know the person more than anything else

Most of the human population is always looking for a mate to share their life with; loneliness is an evolutionary defense mechanism meant to push us into finding a mate so that we might breed one day and continue the human race.   As for me, I find that I'm somewhat of a unicorn in the human population. I'm always alone, always in my head, but I rarely feel lonely or bored with myself.  I use to live by myself, and my friends always asked me if I ever get lonely, and I had the most difficult time understanding why loneliness was a problem at all.

askgaybros,3e0nt3,dcjosh,0,Tue Jul 21 17:17:20 2015 UTC,"Well first off;  never tell anyone that you are interested in them in any serious way until you are absolutely certain that you are. Common mistake and fixable.  Since you've never met any of these guys in person or got to genuinely know each other in person they can only have feelings for your pic(s) and the text you typed out, not you personally.  Sadly that happens a lot and it should be a learning experience when it comes to an end, but some people just never get it and keep doing it over and over again hoping for a different result the next time.  You can politely tell them that your initial interest in them was great, because you were enjoying the attention they showed you, but you have grown as a person since then, want to move on and explore different avenues. Thank them for their time and wish them luck in their pursuits.  Or you can just do the fade away thing and in time stop messaging or replying to them."

I would suggest the two of you have a good talk about this, perhaps even seek some couples counseling to see if there is some non-obvious problem or whatever that could be discovered and remedied before deciding to do anything else."

askgaybros,3dz0vu,hmr21,10,Mon Jul 20 20:08:33 2015 UTC,"However, one thing I really don't like is that he talks in a very ""gay"" feminine inflection.   There are probably reasons for this that you won't want to admit in front of people, so some self reflection while alone will be useful (if you haven't done so already).  Don't search your current perspective to find the answer.  Search your younger self's perspective on ""gay sounding voice"" before/during/after puberty.  That's around when these things seem to set.  Your perspective back then probably affected what you're attracted to.  As we grow older, our conscious perspective might change, but that doesn't mean our affected-attraction will have changed too (some people will get really defensive if you tell them this.  It's because they think changing what one is attracted to is easy.  They don't actually understand how difficult it is to perform that process).   Sometimes this can be changed, but I don't know how to do so.  Most people don't share how they changed what traits arouse them.  They're too busy fending themselves from people crying ""insensitive! self loathing! rude! Asshole!  Kill yourself,"" to really feel compelled to give us detailed explanations.    However, one thing I really don't like is that he talks in a very ""gay"" feminine inflection.   Probably because you think people are going to make assumptions about him because of his feminine inflections and the connotations they associate with said inflections.  Then because you're with him, they're going to extend some of those connotations over to you, and you don't want to be associated with those because you feel they don't accurately represent who you are.  Thus you want to avoid it all together.  OR, you think they're going to judge you because you're attracted to a guy with those feminine inflections & negative connotations, and think weirdly of you.     Would it be ridiculous to break this off because of this?    No.  His existence makes you uncomfortable when meeting people.  That's a pretty good reason to break up unless you two are shut-ins.  There are two options that can change here:   1) You can try to change your perspective on caring about what other people think of your mate, and by extension: what they think of you.  It's easier to type than it is to actually perform.  I won't be listing out the steps to do so, so you'd have to figure it out on your own. 2) You ask him to try and change how he's talking because it sends a message to others that you find yourself uncomfortable when witnessing.    Don't let these people make you feel bad for simply being yourself.  We humans do not control all of the factors that affect our behaviors, personalities, and attractions.  As such, it's quite ridiculous to judge another human in a negative manner for simply being him or herself.  Sure, they might not like you, but do they need to call you an asshole?  Not really, yet they do because they are compelled to.  So just let it slide, and you do you.  If you feel like changing, try to change.  If you don't, don't."

The 'i just dont like it' defense which has already been broken down and re-psychoanalysed online more times that Freuds lego set.  You asked if your quandary was ridiculous? Yes, many of us think it is. Im a guy who used to think the same way as you, but grew out of it. /u/scroticius has suggested some thought processes from which you may gain some perspective. Not liking something is fine, but you specifically said you feel self-conscious about him,  and that opens this different kettle of worms.  Theres dealbreakers and concessions in a relationship. Look as this guys qualities, and look at his flaws and incompatibilities with you. In any relationship theres those concessions that you just have to put up with to get everything else your SO gives you. The voice is just one aspect of this man.

askgaybros,3dy1wd,ijiogjoie,13,Mon Jul 20 13:52:09 2015 UTC,"If you feel uncomfortable about doing it, don't do it. Even if it is just weed.   If this is your first time doing it, say that you are curious but would rather get to know him first and be comfortable enough to work up to it.   Also, no one should force a drug on you or say that they really want to do it on the first date like that. What comes first is you. It's a little different saying that you want to go out for a drink vs smoking weed. One can place you in a more social setting than another."
askgaybros,3dy1wd,envyxd,20,Mon Jul 20 14:32:26 2015 UTC,"Weed and heroin are not even remotely similar. I'd suggest reading about marijuana compared to other drugs, alcohol included. Effects of marijuana range from giggling a lot and being relaxed to getting the munchies and taking a nap. It's practically impossible to overdose from marijuana and it's not addictive. Many people smoke it every day and lead perfectly normal lives. Some people do get a bit anxious when smoking pot but that is fairly fleeting. Your judgment will not be severely impaired unless you're on a diet and he offers you a snack. That said I don't think the first time you smoke pot should be with a stranger...do it with a friend or friends and go on a bike ride or swimming or something fun...  Source: smoke weed every day"

askgaybros,3dy1wd,noTHOTS_noOPPS,11,Mon Jul 20 14:42:15 2015 UTC,"... and it's not addictive   Not entirely true.  All psychoactive drugs have the potential for behavioral addiction, and weed is no different.  Some people are more disposed towards addiction than others and will form dependencies on whatever tickles their limbic system the right way.  Additionally, any rewarding habit can become a behavioral addiction just by shear conditioning.  I'm not going all Reefer Madness on you here, just pointing out that some people can and do get addicted to pot with various levels of seriousness.  Also, you mischaracterize the effects as all benign, whereas some people (myself included) also tend to experience restlessness, paranoia, or outright panic-attacks.  Granted, most of that has to do with your state of mind at the time, the people you're smoking with, and the location.  Same thing with the impaired judgement; that's a function of your tolerance and will change depending on your biology and how often you smoke.    Like I said, not trying to be all doomy here.  I've got no problem with people smoking up, I just cringe to see the potential negative effects glossed over.

askgaybros,3dy1wd,seantorious,6,Mon Jul 20 16:03:51 2015 UTC,The only thing dangerous about weed is that he'll probably empty out your kitchen pantry.
askgaybros,3dy1wd,abrozzi,4,Mon Jul 20 14:35:50 2015 UTC,"Weed is perhaps the least dangerous drug in wide use, it's like a little worse than caffeine for physical health, and is less addictive.  Regular smoking (as opposed to ingestion or vaporizing) is of course not very good for you because ... well, smoking anything is not good for you.  I wouldn't recommend smoking with a guy you don't know at all the first time, because sometimes it makes people anxious, in the worst case it can give a mild panic attack where you'll freak out (but are actually just fine of course).  This goes a lot better if you have a friend you trust to comfort you.  Don't overdo it, eat or smoke a quarter as much as he does.  For a lot of men (probably women too but I haven't asked any lady stoners), weed is essentially an aphrodisiac.  You'll feel warm, relaxed, playful, hypersensitive to physical touch, and often really dirty-minded... which naturally leads to fun things.  But it won't really mess your judgement up that much.  That's the great thing about weed, unlike harder drugs, the rational part of your brain is never really shut off.  Even if you have a panic attack on it, you can calm yourself down.  If you get mild hallucinations, you'll recognize them as such.  If something serious or bad happens around you that needs your attention, you'll be able to cope (though it might be a rather unpleasant experience while high).  There's no level of high on weed where you completely lose touch with reality (trust me, I've tried).  That's very different from alcohol, or pretty much any other depressant/relaxant/stupifying/psychedelic/dissociative drug, where even just a moderate dose practically shuts off the thinking part of your brain or disconnects you from reality."

askgaybros,3dy1wd,wooeee,3,Mon Jul 20 17:13:56 2015 UTC,"Weed is good.  I don't use it much anymore, but it's like getting tipsy drunk and giggly for me, only without a hangover.  It's also good for headaches, sleeplessness and boredom.  I wouldn't do hard drugs, nor could I tolerate dating someone who did.  But weed, in my opinion, is better than alcohol all around."

askgaybros,3dy1wd,learhpa,2,Mon Jul 20 15:56:00 2015 UTC,"I've heard on a couple podcasts that if weed and alcohol were discovered at the same time, no question that weed would be the one to remain legal and alcohol would be the one made illegal when looking at health and societal effects. So the common thought is that weed is less harmful than booze. Booze is just legal due to how entrenched it is in our social norms.  That being said, I don't know if I would want to be under the influence of anything you've never done before around someone you don't know."

Doesn't matter whether it's ranting down the phone at a friend or family member, writing something down and then throwing away the paper, or sending it into the ether as a throwaway on an online forum, the process of writing or talking about your emotions is vital to maintaining your mental balance.   Regarding the HIV test- hopefully it is just a false positive, but don't count on it. As you say, it's just a pill a day, and for someone who is otherwise healthy, there is little impact on life expectancy for the vast majority of patients. My textbook (I'm a medical student) said something like 40 years from diagnosis, for a 35-year-old male diagnosed today in the UK IIRC, which is only 4 years off the average life expectancy.   Dealing with your emotional side is far more important than worrying about the immunological side, as modern HAART stuff is highly effective. Speak to your friends, speak to your family, speak to your doctor, maybe see a counsellor. They will all be able to help you, and help you to come to terms with a chronic condition."

I am accepting, I think being gay is ok, and normal, and a part of life, but sorry if I would rather be a part of the majority every once in a while.  I am non-confrontational by default personality, and being gay conflicts with that because I have to constantly come out to people and I had to develop thick skin to ignore homophobic comments.  Not all of us are headstrong, leaders, there are people who are highly sociable and care about the opinion of a lot of people. Being gay conflicts with my personality in so many ways, I'm a people-pleasing, non-confrontational, nice guy..... and a lot of gay people really don't understand that humans are individuals with different personalities, and being a trailblazer ISN'T for everybody.  Call it weak or whatever negative adjective you want, but I am a caring, loving person, I am overtly empathetic, and I am pretty sure I am a highly sensitive person(it's a thing, I get anxiety from super loud noises; can't help it, too much stimulation at once I don't like, and I am very intune with other peoples feelings and can hurt easily), this is beneficial for people who are ACCEPTED by the majority of people, because I can interact with anyone without having to worry about what they're thinking about me.

askgaybros,3dwgsw,blowhardV2,4,Mon Jul 20 08:43:08 2015 UTC,"I actually feel extremely lucky. I can't imagine trying to navigate the sex/dating world as a straight man. I watch my brother and friends struggle with the straight dating world; i know many straight guys who have been single for years; and likley havent gotten laid in a year. Women seem much more reserved, and less accepting of advances from guys. In the straight world its pretty much 100% the mans responsibility to approach and flirt with a woman; and women basically just filter through all the guys who chase after them. Being a straight male means you are part of a very large pool of other potential suitors; and have to do more to stand out.  in comparison being gay just seems so easy. There are app based solely around hooking up and having sex; and both being sex-crazed males they can just be straightforward about their intentions.

It's just really privileged white gays championing privileged white gay issues to save and protect privileged white gays. Everything else is just subterfuge. Because, of course, privileged white gays are the only ones with PACs and enough of a majority to get their goals achieved. That's why now that gay marriage is achieved the whole hullabaloo has largely died down except for marital protections. Because issues that largely minority gay people face such as poverty, homelessness, joblessness, higher HIV prevalence doesn't concern them nearly as much. I just truly wish we could be honest about it, that's not even considering the other issues the gay majority glosses over like passing-privilege and a superficial minority complex but those are bones to pick another time."

While I was reading your post I kept wondering what you get out of this relationship. Going on by your post your bf doesn't seem to do much for you at all. He sounds like someone who shouldn't be in a relationship; who should instead be working out his personal problems and straightening out his finances. Underneath all your bf's problems there doesn't seem to be much of a person there. Where is he behind it all? Maybe you are asking yourself the same question.   What do you get out of being with him? No offense but from my perspective he sounds like a self-absorbed, incompetent crybaby and kind of a dumbass. But I know what it means to struggle and would give him the benefit of the doubt. Does he do anything to make you feel like you matters to do him?  It would be bad for him if you were to leave, which is bad for you. It means he's passively controlling your decision to stay in the relationship. Your boy really needs to get his shit together. From what you've said it doesn't even make much sense that you are in a relationship anyway. You both live far away from each other. You are both busy trying to manage your lives with the hands you've been dealt. He could be running off to college again soon. What gives? You are only in a relationship because you have been in a relationship with him. You're going on autopilot. No matter how tiresome he gets, you stick with him because he still makes up a part of your life and has done so for 7 years. You're doing it just to do it, not because you get any satisfaction from the relationship.  I don't have any concrete advice for you. But I think the reasonable thing to do is to start backing away from him. If you broke up with him he would probably turn into a suicide risk, given his history. This is serious. So instead of breaking up with him--and I think that's inevitable at this point--act in ways so that he will break up with you. He's got enough on his plate and honestly shouldn't be in a relationship."

Being in a relationship is about compromise, but it seems as though you're being expected to compromise on everything that's important to you, while he sees it as sufficient that he does the bare minimum that could be expected of a reasonably independent adult. That might be ok on a temporary basis until he is at a stage where he can contribute more, but it certainly sounds as though it's reached the stage where it's just not sustainable.   Breaking up with him may be the hardest thing that you've ever had to do, but it seems like not only is it inevitable, but that it will be a huge step forward for you in terms of living your life the way that you want to live it."

Met my current husband while I wasn't even 20 yet. It was all fine and dandy and we got married after quite a short period (not even two years).  He's disabled, but that never posed a problem for me. However he became clinically depressed, due to no fault of his mind you, after several really unlucky and really bad events in life.  However, I'm still in my early twenties, he's 4 years older than me,  so my train of thought was ""I'm healthy, I'm hardworking, I can work something out and pull us both through to some better life"". This seems quite a lot like the direction you've been heading to, and what your boyfriend is expecting. Mine on the other hand has clearly told me that I should leave him because all what he will do will be dragging me down with him. I shrugged it off, and told him we will work things out.  However, it's exactly what happened. What was originally a ""I will pause studying for one year, and focus on making things better for us"" turned into ""years of struggling, being overworked and relying on overtime and side jobs to put a roof over our head, and no chance of ever affording to continue studying again""  I'm not saying this will 100% happen to you, but you're on that road. I'm now married, bound by everything, and my husband has attempted suicide three times. Three times that I know of, at least. I know what would happen if I ever drifted away and left, and it's what I'll never do. You've already done the footwork for the leaving process, you just have to say the words.  One final closing thought: if I had a time machine, and could choose not to ever meet my husband again, I would, as harsh and disgusting as it may sound. Do not sacrifice your life so easily. That's a thing that works in novels and Hollywood movies, and other things where notions of happy endings are present, with blatant disregard of all the unhappy endings that happened. Real life? Not so much."

He's refusing all the help he's being offered, and your support right now is telling him ""that's OK"" when it's obviously not.

Don't let him bargain or set conditions, such as ""If I get better will you take me back?"" Because then he isn't getting better for himself, he'd be doing it for you and that's not sustainable. It's okay to love him, as long as you realize right now your love is destroying him.  Maybe that will finally be the wakeup call he needs. Or it might not. Either way, I think you've done everything for him that you can. This is not a healthy relationship to be in for either of you, and you know that."

askgaybros,3dwjci,lachlansreddit,3,Mon Jul 20 11:50:25 2015 UTC,"First, going to a $50,000 a year school with his history is a train wreck waiting to happen. Tying yourself to his debt would be an incalculable disaster on your part.  Do NOT co-sign on any of these loans if he or his parents attempt to coerce you to, under any circumstances.  His debt will then be YOUR debt, until YOU pay it off because he never will.    Second, he wants you to fight for the relationship when it seems he never does anything to do that himself. What has he done to fight for it?  Best advice is to tell him he's not a kid anymore, and there aren't any more excuses.  It's time to grow up, get a full time job, any job.  Be a responsible person, first.  He said he would ""sacrifice anything"".  Let him prove that by taking any job, and sticking with it. Then, you can make a judgment whether you want to be with him or not. Enabling him in any way will keep you on this treadmill to nowhere."

I've encouraged him to do other options (e.g., an interdisciplinary degree which would just take the credits he has and finish in less than a year) or certifications instead of ""formal"" college since his field isn't so much dependent on degree as it is on your skills/portfolio. Forgot to mention in the beginning he also has ADD, so he is very disorganized and has trouble working things like that out  He and his family both felt I would be the main income, and he might be a ""stay at home dad"" while working on video games from home. Not only financially does that sound nuts in hindsight given his debt, but also considering how isolationist he is with everything he really NEEDS something that will encourage him to go out and interact with people"

askgaybros,3dwjci,samuelmouse,2,Tue Jul 21 14:25:08 2015 UTC,"THANK YOU everyone for all of your support. Not to be melodramatic, but this has been the most difficult thing I’ve experienced in my life right now. I brought up the problems I felt we had in our relationship last night, basically keeping my boundaries but also remaining open to possibly trying to work it out later down the road or being friends. Rather than discuss them or admit we have problems, he blew up and turned it into “well you aren’t willing to fight for us” and “you must not love me,” basically saying that I’m “overblowing” things and that “well if you aren’t wiling to work things out maybe we should just break up.”  It was night; I even tried saying we should wait until morning when things were less emotional from us being sleepy. He kept pushing things and getting more and more needy but also pretty angry/dismissive of me. He’d ignore the nuances and turn it back into a character statement about him like “you just must not love me” or “when did you stop loving me.” Needless to say, I took the “bait” he put out about breaking up and told him we were better off as friends (if he could “do” that) or just cut contact.   Today I think I’ve seen the full Kubler-Ross Stages of Grief cycle…8 times? I have seen a whole new side of him that is downright cruel and ugly to just flat out stupid. EG, sending me texts like: “Thanks for wasting the past six years of my life when I could have been looking for someone capable of love” to “I told my brother and mom about all that you have said, and they are really pissed at you.” Like WTF does their opinion matter in all this. How is that – a threat - supposed to make me want to get back together with you?   He’s been trying to “bargain,” saying things like “you may have given up on us, but I haven’t,” “I’m willing to do anything to make things work,” or “I just want to be with you because I LOVE you.” “Is there anything I can say or do to keep us together?” Based off all this, I don’t see a friendship working out, as it would be toxic since he would think it could still somehow turn into a relationship again “later down the road.”  This has all really made me become aware of (1) how much of a dumbass I’ve been, (2) how socially isolated I made myself (because now I have 0 friends), (3) how much I have been co-dependent on this relationship running on auto, and (4) how BIG of a bullet I have dodged with all of this. He is now very much like “I messed up royally this time… will you give me a second chance?” Nope, not going down that road again. Right now, even IF he really is open to trying to work things out, I just don’t (1) want to bother with the time (this has been the “last straw”) or (2) believe he really would have any form of long-term change. It is too lodged in his self-identity right now, and I am not willing to “stick it out.” Towards the end of today, he would say things like ""Look I know I've been a dumbass... but we have been through so much together... and you are going to end things over one half-awake texting session?"" Or ""I was a total jerk and I am sorry... you're right... I wasn't fair to you :( I've been reading more and more and... I was selfish."" But then he turns things around and is like: ""but remember YOU ended this not me. I wanted to work out our issues. You felt they were too great to even try."" His final text: ""sleep well, heartbreaker.""   THANK YOU all so much for your input and reassurance. I feel a lot of mixed emotions right now – guilt (since this all happened through text while he was on vacation with his family – but HE pushed the issue), anger, grief, depression, anxiety, but also relief! I am so thankful for the slap in the face your posts have been (albeit needed and done in an extremely kind manner!). Holy crap – I am glad this happened while I am still young, just starting off instead of being “locked” in an area/living with him, and before we got married or anything (which his parents were pushing us to do, I forgot to add). Moving forward, I’m trying to just learn to love myself just for me, being single, which tbh is something I’m going to have to remember how to do.  TLDR: We broke up, wasn't pretty. Thank you all for your advice and support through this difficult time"

It just sounds like he gave up on life for some pretty pathetic reasons. Why does he expect you to fight for him when he's not willing to fight for you, or himself? I had to drop out and find a full time job when I was seventeen, and I went through a depressive episode, but I loved my boyfriend enough to fight it for him. Depression changes people, and sometimes they need a slap in the face to see reality for what it is. Tell him you can fight it with him, but only if he gets the fuck up and tries, instead of dragging you down with him."

It's not your ""problem."" I know it's hard being in your situation, considering the past you've had with him, and a lot of time and effort has been put into the relationship, but sometimes you just need to pick up what's left and run. It's not a healthy relationship for either of you. He's become dependent on you in more ways that's not healthy. No one can tell you what to do but yourself. You have to realize what your priorities are (and hopefully you come to the conclusion that your own well-being is your top priority) You have your entire life ahead of you.

The first year of a relationship is a year of surprises as the layers of your sexy new boyfriend are peeled back one by one and you get to know the real him. This current situation could go several ways, but it seems to me he is simply easing into the role of partner, and he's finding it difficult or unnecessary to ditch long-term fuck buddies. Talk to him about your expectations. I wouldn't dump him over this.   If however you can't live with his views on fidelity, or with his lying, it's still fairly easy to dump him because you've only been together 7 months. In that case, each of you probably needs a partner who is more on the same wavelength when it comes to transparency and extracurricular sex."

I don't kiss and tell so I reveal less than your bf does and if that makes me a liar by omission, see ya bye, that's my code. I won't talk about you either.  He may feel that Dom/sub is not what he wants with you. He may someday want that. Maybe w you maybe not. That's your guy. Might feel he has too much respect for you to Dom you.   My concern is a boss whose employee has a documented chat about pissing in said employee's mouth: he's a fucking idiot, and if he were my employee he'd be out of a job. Even when it's consensual it still sets up a potential for the employee to blackmail him. So either your guy figures he can put the employee into the ground career-wise, or he's a money-player. Either way it's the real semi-red flag here as I see it: he's a risk junkie. But he's your guy and a lot of power hitters act this way. And BTW they flip and sub as years pass, in my experience. But your friends telling you to make a huge deal of him not ""coming clean"" about encounters before you? Actually, they're none of your business."

askgaybros,3dxieg,victrolla,2,Mon Jul 20 16:14:38 2015 UTC,"There is always more to it...that being said, if there is more will it be a deal breaker? I mean, you guys weren't together when these events happened and maybe he was only trying to spare your feelings if you ever had to go to a work event and see this guy. Also, no matter how accommodating people's partners may seem at the beginning of a relationship, it is often extremely hard to be fully honest about things they could easily be rejected for such as a fetish or fooling around with a coworker.  That being said, I do think your friends are over reacting. You told them the situation, they gave you advice, now it is time to move on from the conversation. You do not have to follow their advice and should simply thank them, that you considered it, but you will continue in this relationship (if that is what you want to do.)  Also, you might be under reacting, but if you feel comfortable moving forward and don't think he would betray your trust, then you are the best judge of the situation. If you love him and want to continue in your relationship, do it! He obviously trust you and did not think he was hiding something from you since you had the ability to go through his phone. Trust your gut in this whatever it is telling you. Good luck!!!"

Its entirely in the realm of possibility that the times he sexed this guys were that inconsequential that he forgot but I dunno, personally that doesn't seem like something I'd forget to that extent. Given that it feels one of two things are more likely, he feels like you might look down on him for having sexed a married guy so much or he's had a few sexual incidents with him since being with you and he doesn't want to fess up about it.

This is the only song I know where someone honestly says what it is and describes it. Sad songs aren't really my thing, but the musical arrangement I found very beautiful, yet disturbingly haunting, matching the mood of the lyrics perfectly I guess.   Anyway;  It happened a little over 7 years ago.   The guy who killed my buddy had been my buddy's new partner for about 3 months. I didn't have a chance to get to know him very well yet, but he seemed like an average, normal gay guy to me, not some over masculine mannered type who might look a little dangerous or anything like that.  From what I was told my buddy's partner had been cheating for about a month, but broke it off with that guy he was cheating with a week before everything happened. The guy he broke it off with was in a bar when my buddy and his partner were out in the same bar and that guy tried to chat up my buddy in front of his partner, who got pissed, took my buddy to another bar and proceeded to get drunk before they went home.  After that I'm not sure what happened other than they must have gotten into an argument that turned violent. They must have made up or whatever and went to bed, because the guy didn't know that he killed my buddy and didn't realize that he was dead until the next morning when he tried to wake him up, just like in the song.  My buddy died from traumatic brain injury, so he must have been hit in the head pretty badly and it took time for it to cause his death.   It makes me feel pretty bad to think about it even now, plus it makes me feel a bit guilty for having a tiny bit of sympathy for the guy who killed my buddy, because I'm sure he didn't mean to do that, but now has to live with knowing that he did it for the rest of his life.   All because of love, cheating, jealousy and alcohol + whatever else if there was anything else."

In a situation like that, it wouldn't harm them in the least if they didn't genuinely want you to be unhappy for whatever reason. Besides, maybe they'll learn something from having their nose shoved into the fact that they were wrong in their predictions about your future.  As for it being hollow, arguing with success just makes a person look stupid, and it's even more excruciating for someone to do that because the conclusion is pretty much inescapable even to them (no matter what they might like to otherwise say.) It can be side splittingly funny to watch someone try to make themselves believe that someone else's success or happiness is hollow, just because they believe that person doesn't ""deserve"" it for whatever reason.

Beyond all the expensive electronics (Video camera, big screen TV, Macbook Pro, Xbox yadda yadda, a big deal for me to have earned all of that at age 20) the part that sucked the most was to have my backup drives with all my photos and all my work swiped.   But he didn't stop there either. He started calling my parents and family members and telling them lies about me. Then when they didn't believe him he started making asinine threats on their lives. Then he started getting his friends to call me and verbally abuse me. Then he called, crying hysterically, apologised and asked me to come back.  I stayed home for a year, got a new job, took a break from college and tried to rebuild my ability to trust people. When I moved back one of his friends spotted me and my ex consequently sent me a long winded text message. I never bothered reading it.  During that year I was away I have to say I felt some strong urges to physically assault him and leave him bleeding on the sidewalk somewhere. But by the time I had returned, I didn't really have many bad feelings for him. He's emotionally unstable and damaged beyond repair, just having to be himself every day was enough punishment.  I do sometimes wonder if his next ex wasn't as forgiving."
askgaybros,3dy5h0,LenientWhale,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:02:58 2015 UTC,"That's insane. Any advice on what to look out for in new relationships that looking back you would think okay, he's that type of person?"
askgaybros,3dy5h0,oylooc,2,Mon Jul 20 21:10:51 2015 UTC,Well he was my first ever relationship so I was pretty willfully ignorant of the signs. He literally only had that one friend and was just 'friendly' with the people he worked with. This is the biggest red flag I think. You need someone who has a good circle of friends because that's how you know someone is worth being around. The company someone keeps tells you a lot about their character as well.
askgaybros,3dy5h0,LenientWhale,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:05:08 2015 UTC,I think your point has some validity but that it's overstated.  There are many possible exceptions to your rule that someone without friends is bad news.  What if someone has only recently moved to the area ? What if they went through a breakup and the ex got the friends ? What if their friends moved away or (God forbid) died ? What if they ended friendships because of betrayal or disloyalty ?  I could go on and on but I think I've made my point.  People should not be conclusively prejudged and discarded without giving them a chance.
askgaybros,3dy5h0,Whatstheanswer2,2,Tue Jul 21 06:05:50 2015 UTC,"Of course. None of what I said is ""write him off"". I was just asked what to look out for."

But I don't feel comfortable with the idea of 'looking out' for this. Maybe it's too fine a distinction but I think that the way to view this is just that it's something to 'consider'."
askgaybros,3dy5h0,Whatstheanswer2,2,Tue Jul 21 14:05:37 2015 UTC,"As fundamentally social creatures, I think someone not having friends is cause for deep concern.  Will it be the reason to date or not date a person? For me, definitively, yes. Because in my experience the majority of the time this happens, it can be rooted back to a number of abnormalities or insecurities that I don't want in my partner. I'm not saying they're necessarily bad people. But we all look for different things, so I'm just giving my $.02"

But I'm not crazy and go ruining other people's lives and screwing them over. That's too much pettyness.  I always leave an open channel for communication. I cared about them deeply at one point and have helped shape their life. Just being a dick for no reason makes no sense.
askgaybros,3dy5h0,Conflux,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:21:24 2015 UTC,"In a sense, but not actively. My ex was possessive, immature, and crazy; essentially he displays behavior consistent with a mentally defective child than an adult. Well people who knew us didn't like him all that much and when I left him, everybody started posting pictures with me tagged in them showing that I was having a good time without him [really, it's just life] and when we started dating again [not sure how successful he was since he cheated on me] nobody would go on dates with him because guys he met with on Grindr or elsewhere learned from my friends that he was crazy. Up until about a year ago, he'd keep calling asking if we'd date again, but I said no because I'm happily with my current boyfriend. Furthermore, I told him the truth in that I wasn't attracted to someone who crazy and I couldn't comfortably view myself as someone with such low standards and that hindsight is 20/20. That was the last I'd heard from him since, while I wouldn't call it revenge, I do believe that it was a great way to be honest with myself and to him."

askgaybros,3dy5h0,youarejustanasshole,6,Mon Jul 20 17:24:47 2015 UTC,"No, if you sleep with someone, you are threatening me with danger.   I'm not saying cheating is okay, something worthy of a one time pass, or even excusable. But neither is your actions. If they cheat on you, dump their ass, not beat it. Makes you just as scummy as they are. You think because its a dude and not a woman YOU get a free pass on threatening to beat the shit out of them?   People that don't believe in an eye for an eye are the ones that don't understand why so many criminals are repeat offenders.   And people that do believe in that shouldn't be in a modern society. Go join an extremist group, they love that stuff.   Punishment for doing something that DANGEROUS needs to be severe.   Yes, you should be punished severely for threatening someone so bad that they live in fear of you in their day to day lives after not even being with you anymore.  If someone doesn't use their blinker and almost runs you off the road, should they be locked up for attempted murder?   I know my ex will never potentially spread a disease to another partner again because he knows that there are people out there that will hurt him for doing so.   You are fucking insaaaaaaane. You threatened him off of nothing but a ""this could have happened"". You are insaaaaaane. (Again, not forgiving a cheater at all here. But also not letting a guy who actually DID damage to get a free pass because a guy almost/coulda/possibly did damage)   I do nothing wrong to people   Except threaten to confine them to a wheelchair over something that could have hypothetically happened but didn't...   I am not very vengeful   Yes you are, or did you forget "" I scared the living shit out him with my threats."" from like an hour ago...   The government doesn't protect people, so people have to protect themselves.   Ooooooo, you're one of those ""jet fuel can't melt steel beams"" guys, this is making a lot of sense now.   There is nothing that I could do to get justice if he had given me HIV, absolutely nothing legally I could do.   Actually their is, if you took 2 minutes to do a google search. If he had it and knew, he can and would be charged with attempted murder.    But if he gave me a disease, I would have no problem taking something away from him, this is one of the only times I believe in vigilante justice, it may not solve the problem, but if someone is willing to spread disease they need to be taught a lesson in my opinion.   Again, you are insane and should be locked up yourself. But thank god for free speech huh? You should be in jail for threatening him like you did, or at least be in anger management.   Just an opinion, don't try to spin it like I'm the asshole, cause I would never endanger someones life, but again, if they endanger mine, it's ONLY NATURAL to want vengeance   There is a difference you don't seem to understand. You are an asshole. You crossed the line of wanting vengence, and seeking it by terrorizing him. You. Are. An asshole.   that is showing complete disregard for me as a human and individual.   As is threatening his life/well being/safety over a hypothetical outcome that DID NOT HAPPEN.   My ex didn't care if he gave me a disease, my life wasn't important to him, why on earth would I just sit back and take it had he given me something.   Your entire defence and justification is a outcome that didn't happen. You need to be locked up.   Turning the other cheek only perpetuates bad behaviour, sometimes you have to fix the problem yourself.   Fixing the problem is leaving the relationship. Making the problem worse, is threatening him over something that could have but didn't happen.   I am fine with cheating, ABSOLUTELY FINE WITH IT, but I am not fine with cheating and then having unprotected sex with me because you are lying to me about yourself. That is evil to me, just evil.   You are evil to me for what you did. Pure evil, and you think you are a white knight for what you did.  You disgust me."
askgaybros,3dy5h0,youarejustanasshole,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:44:04 2015 UTC,"??? How is what I did evil? Like holy shit, I didn't do anything but threaten him, he threatened me by potentially giving me something, how the FUCK IS THAT OK?   Wow, you just answered your own question, didn't even need to do it, thanks :) You threatened him over something that didn't happen, that is evil.    I am fine with cheating, I don't think people are scum bags for doing it, I think they are when they don't fess up to it right away.   Well I think they are scum the second they cheat instead of calling off the relationship and finding all the single life sexual action you want. Too each their own, neither of us are wrong in THESE opinions.   I didn't attempt to murder him, I was going to punch him out, thats called aggravated assault dumbass.   True, fuck tard. But you are full of so much rage, I doubt you would stop punching when they lose consciousness. You seem to think its okay to threaten people over hypothetical outcomes that didn't happen, you could just as easily justify keeping a ""fight"" going if they are knocked out.   You go to jail for assault charges, and they're pretty fucking common, and a lot of the time it's the persons own fault.   You go to jail FOR assault, rarely for doing something that LEADS to you being assaulted. If a person cheats, they get assaulted but their lover. Who goes to jail? The cheater or the assaulter?   My friends brother got his ass kicked at a party, and him and his buddies kicked the guys ass for doing so(during the whole event), guess what the judge did? Throw out the case and charged the fucker who started the whole thing, he thought the guy deserved to be beaten basically.   Yeah, they started a FIGHT. They didn't cheat and ""maybe"" get a disease. God I would love to be in your courtroom one day, please invite me :) Judge would laugh at what you call a comparable instance as to why you are not guilty here.   Get off your fucking high horse and keep defending the spread of disease.   Still waiting for you to tell me where I said that :) I haven't edited a SINGLE post, so again, I'll wait. I AM defending a guy who, in a hypothetical, got a disease and willingly spread it, but even you say it didn't happen, sooooo I'll wait :)   I'm glad people think its ok to do so, really makes me have faith in humanity, and at least it explains why infection is spread so quickly.   And I'm glad you give the courts a reason to send weak people like you to jail over such a petty instance. Love to see how other hardened inmates treat a guy who got sent to jail for threatening his ex over something that could have happened. Hope you where the bottom in your relationship, otherwise you gonna have a bad time.   I'm also glad you think ""punching someone"" isn't ok, but giving them AIDS is. What an awesome moral compass you have   Again buddy, quote me from ANY comment where I said spreading disease and AIDS is okay and morally acceptable. I've only asked you like 6 times now across all my posts.    I'd also like to add he has sent me SEVERAL TEXTS AND EMAIL apologizing for doing so, he even admitted he deserved to get knocked out.   Stockholm syndrome.   Do you ""bros"" even know what knocked out means, it doesn't mean death, numb nuts. It means it's gonna hurt for a short period of time, versus him giving me something that could KILL ME   ""Bro"" do you even know the dangers of being knocked out? Losing consciousness is not something you always just wake up from with no side effects. See any footballer whose been knocked out. Are they all just fine and peachy?  And HIV is managable now albeit not curable. You wont die from it unless you don't get it treated. And before you spin that as me saying getting HIV is no big deal, it is, but its not the ""I have HIV therefor I am going to die"" case that it was in the 80s."

I've had guys guilt trip me, toy with emotions, but honestly at this point I've been through enough aleady, I just put it behind me and look out for me first.

Cheating was stupid, yes, we agree. Threatening him was stupider. Cheaters usually repeat offend, but I can attest that its hard to let go when you love someone. That said, it's no excuse for threatening someone. Nothing is.

And no one in this thread is forgiving him for it.   He then after said sex, slept with me. We didn't do anal, we gave eachother head, that is risky enough,   Actually, the risk is pretty low according to the CDC, minus swallowing.   I don't use condoms with blow jobs, and I expect my SO to be faithful, if they aren't faithful I expect them to tell me and not risk giving me anything.   We all do. But not living up to expectations does not excuse threatening someone over a ""could have happened"" scenario. Yes he was god damn mind bogglingly stupid with what he did.

Why does everyone think I'm in the wrong, I didn't do anything to him  he also didn't want to get his ass kicked either.  To me that is knowingly sleeping with someone and potentially getting infected, then sleeping with the person you say you ""love"" and potentially giving them said infection. The risks are there, to me that is unforgivable.   Dude. I don't get why you are still living in a world of what might have happened justifies what did happen. Clearly, he didn't love you the same amount you loved him, because he cheated, more than once. I understand that hurts, but going around saying he cheated = him trying to get infected and give you something therefor you threatening him is justified is, as I have said multiple times, INSANE.   Yes it didn't happen, and I didn't do anything unless it happened, I told him ""If I get something from you, I am going to kick your ass""   You do realize you contradict yourself IN THE SAME SENTENCE. You DID do something, in my opinion worse than cheating. And don't you dare bring in the ""he coulda got an STI"" bull shit again. This isn't a discussion about maybes, this is a discussion on what DID and DIDN'T happen.   simple enough, and I still stand by it, I didn't do anything to him   Except threaten him, which is against the law. Cheating isn't. What part of that isn't getting through to you?   Would you honestly be ""ok"" if your boyfriend of 2 years cheated and gave you and STI? Would you honestly not want to do anything about it? Would you honestly think it was ok for him to do that?   I've already answered this question but I'll do it again. No I would not be okay. I would be livid. I would never talk to him again. That includes threatening him for giving me a currently uncurable but treatable disease. I draw the line at making a bad situation worse. You would probably go out and try and kill him. I would have the same feelings, but I would never say them or act on them.   He didn't do it, but he potentially could've done it, I wasn't going to do anything unless it happened.   Except threaten him.   Yes it's hypothetical but it's a realistic hypothetical, two of my boyfriends friends are HIV + because their partners weren't honest with them about cheating, so sorry, to me it's a very real thing that could happen.   Ironically, we have the same amount of exes that now have HIV, and are both from/near Toronto. But you keep blurring the issue. It doesn't matter how many people we know have it, you can't go around threatening people. PERIOD. It does not matter what they do. YOU CAN'T DO THAT.  To everyone, gay or straight, this is something they can get. It hits you and I harder than people who don't know someone with HIV. When I was telling a straight buddy of mine that one of my gay friends now has HIV, he was like ""Oh that makes sense, he was gay"". I wanted to punch him for being so insensitive. But you know what. I didn't. I didn't threaten him to behave better because saying that kinda shit affects different people differently. Do you still not see how you crossed the line?   The gay community is too soft when it comes to spreading disease   Are you fucking insane? It was the gay community that was most impacted by the spreading of this disease? Are you unaware of the 80s? Link ONE source saying ""the gay community just doesn't care and is soft on the idea of spreading diseases"" FUCKING ONE.   all of my straight friends would BE LIVID if they contracted something potentially life threatening from their SO.   ""anyone would BE LIVID if they contracted something potentially life threatening from their SO.""  FTFY."

I should've waited for the results and not threatened him, I actually understand that 100% now, haha wish you were there when it all happened to explain it to me like that.  I should've waited and if I got the results, then ""knocked him out"", I wasn't going to kill him, murderous thoughts did not enter my mind I actually want him to have a good happy life and am glad he is with someone that he ""does"" love. This isn't sarcasm either.  I actually understand where you are coming from.  Threatening someone without empirical justification is not ok, and I do feel guilty for that.  I was really in a bad place when it happened, he cheated twice, and the thought never crossed my mind once even if I was ""falling out of love with him"" I just never ever in my life would ever risk spreading a disease TO ANYBODY ever, regardless if I love them. I respect human life; even though I threatened to hurt him, and I believe that and it doesn't matter if you don't I actually respect other people and would never do anything that could harm them without the harm being thrown back at me.  But I do 100% understand where you are coming from, I get very emotional and can have a clouded thought process, I really can't explain how much I loved this guy and how much he ""showed"" me he loved me, it just wasn't expected and seemed like complete disregard for me life.  That is what hurt the most, the disregard and disrespect towards my life, my mind set was "" Well if he thinks this way about me why don't I do the same""  BUt you are right, threats are never ok (I think they are if he did give me a disease)   Sorry to bother you.  I deleted my posts because I don't like saying negative things about HIV + people, I know that a lot of people that get it or spread it aren't doing it on purpose and I just didn't want to offend anybody.  I still stand by my feelings that if he did give me something I would've been justified to punch him in his stupid face, but that is just my opinion, juvenile as it may be it's how I am, and I don't think I am a rotten person for thinking so because again, I have never harmed another human being emotionally or physically in my life so I know I am not a bad person.  I constantly am thinking about others, and just couldn't have done that to him.  Have no idea why it took an argument on a random website to make realize what I did was stupid(All my friends/family actually agreed with me but maybe there were just being sympathetic, the guy made me cry for like 2 months after, I still miss him)  So ya, I was wrong, you are right, no sarcasm, being 100% honest I just had an epiphany. Something in the way you worded things.  When I say he was scared shitless, he actually was, but thats because he is a giant pussy and could not defend himself against me, not because I was threatening death, he really can't handle pain and is more effeminate so the thought of getting knocked out wasn't the greatest idea to him. I'm not saying effeminate guys are pussies either, just he was a pussy and not the type to have ever experienced hard pain in his life before, and obviously I'm not against effeminate guys cause I was madly in love with one."

LISTEN TO ME ON THIS. I HAVE EXPERIENCE. I may not agree with where you mind was then or in some of this thread, but as a guy to another, I am saying this to help you not go through what I went through over something that could be avoided by just keeping your mouth shut and moving on.   But I do 100% understand where you are coming from, I get very emotional and can have a clouded thought process,    No one thinks straight when they are not in a normal state of mind. We've all been there as humans, and I don't blame you for having those thoughts, just acting on them. I don't think less of you AT ALL though.   I still stand by my feelings that if he did give me something I would've been justified to punch him in his stupid face,    I agree with you.  Feeling that is perfectly fine. Hell feeling you would be justify in taking his life for ruining and possibly cutting yours short is fine. FEELING them is fine. It's anger. Acting on them is what gets you into trouble. I don't even like stepping on ants if I can help it, but hoooooooly fuck the things I would have liked to have done to the guy who started that pissing contest and then got me arrested as a fucking joke.... If I didn't have that 3 grand I could be in jail over a fucking warehouse joking (or so I thought) pissing contest.   I constantly am thinking about others, and just couldn't have done that to him.   Again I agree. I couldn't do that myself. I can't even be slutty and I want to. It's just not in me to be capable of doing that. I've had guys beg me to do things I used to think I wanted, but its just not in me to do. I'm glad you are a better man than this guy was to you.   Have no idea why it took an argument on a random website to make realize what I did was stupid(All my friends/family actually agreed with me but maybe there were just being sympathetic, the guy made me cry for like 2 months after, I still miss him)   Friends and family will always back you up no matter what. Murderers (horrible analogy NOT comparing you to one) still have friends and their mothers and their wives visit them. The people close to you want nothing but you to feel better, so will often tell you what you want to hear VS what you need to hear. I just don't want you to end up in a place with those kind of people over something small and stupid.   So ya, I was wrong, you are right, no sarcasm, being 100% honest I just had an epiphany. Something in the way you worded things.   Half of why I stay in this subreddit. A lot of people will just call people names and shit on them for something they say that sounds bad, I like to try and find out why and figure out if its fixable through dialog. Yes I can be harsh at times, but as everyone tells me, ""relevant user name""   When I say he was scared shitless, he actually was, but thats because he is a giant pussy and could not defend himself against me, not because I was threatening death, he really can't handle pain and is more effeminate so the thought of getting knocked out wasn't the greatest idea to him.   I'm ex military myself, and I will do ANYTHING to not get in a fight. I don't care if I know a bit of unarmed combat and have used machine guns and rifles, I want to just go home and cuddle someone, or talk my way out of a confrontation, I had my run in with the other side of getting into trouble with the law, NEVER FUCKING AGAIN.   I'm not saying effeminate guys are pussies either, just he was a pussy and not the type to have ever experienced hard pain in his life before, and obviously I'm not against effeminate guys cause I was madly in love with one.   No one is judging you on what you do/don't like in a guy. I love fem guys, and the ""bros"" here will usually be against that but on the surface they say they are accepting and kind of all gays.  If anything, gays ARE concerned about the spread of disease, but WAAAAY more concerned if the guy they are after is hot. Sadly thats probably why you think, and rightfully so, gays don't care as much about HIV. ""Hes sooo hot and its just one time, it wont happen to me"" probably is the main reason HIV is 1 in 120."

Although yes, under distress it seemed right, so I find no fault with you doing it then under that mindset.

I really am going to try and change my mind on thinking it's still ok to harm him for doing it.   Thinking it is perfectly fine and normal. Healthy almost I would say. Its the acting on those thoughts. HORRIBLE ANALOGY WARNING. It's kind of like pedophiles. Whether they want the thoughts or not, they have them. Whether they act on them or not, is what will bring them very serious consequences. Again. NOT COMPARING you to a person who seeks sex with minors. Just that so long as the things you think of that could put you in jail stay in your head, its no harm no foul. (I really wish I had a better analogy but I'm not good at this).   I can't wrap my head around the idea of ""letting it go"", but maybe that just makes me a bit of a weak person.   Hardly a week person. Someone you loved and trusted, betrayed both of those things. If history shows us anything, many many wars have been started over spurned lovers. There is even genres of movies called revenge porn, Man on Fire, John Wick etc. It is perfectly natural to feel anger, hate, vile, death upon those who have wronged you. But the only thing that separates us from other primates is that we don't harm those who wrong us. We let our, even at times imperfect, justice system deal with it, or do our best to put it behind us. Hell, first relationship I was in got ended on Canada Day, via email, while I was doing military training. HOOOOLY fuck the hate, anger, rage, etc etc. Took a year to get over it.    Still am considering it, I am very open minded and can have my mind changed easily, and you already successfully did so to me partially.   All I can say is consider it. Fuck possibly even plan how you would do it. But scrap the plan after. Weigh the years in prison verses years of being free to hate him during a day job or years you could find someone else whose happyness makes you not care about the woes of yesteryear.  I mean I still remember the fuckers name who pulled this shit on me. Holy fuck do I want revenge. But I already know what a few words has cost me, if I actually acted, I'd probably be in jail for life.  I too felt that doing the time for the crime would be no big deal. One. Fucking. Night in a cell and I was fucking done with acting on emotion. It was my first real time doing it too.   Hate with your mind, not your body."

askgaybros,3dy5h0,youarejustanasshole,2,Mon Jul 20 19:34:56 2015 UTC,"No I agree with you but we will have to disagree on the hitting thing. I really do think they deserve to get punched out only because they will have no punishment otherwise, and without punishment people will continue to do what they do.  Cheating isn't illegal, but cheating and risking giving a disease is frowned upon so it is a grey area, yes assault is illegal, but I do think that it can be justified.  This is a large stretch, but someone getting beaten for ""bullying"", is something I actually agree with, a bully deserves to be knocked out so they keep their fucking mouth shut in the future. That is just my opinion. Mental torment can be much much worse than physical pain, I know a lot of people who have limited themselves because of bullying and bullying isn't illegal.(My sister for example has very low self esteem because of bullies, and that just isn't fair in my opinion, everyone that caused her harm should be charged, because everyone has the right to live a peaceful and happy life)  There isn't much protecting people when it comes to mental harm, or spreading disease, but there is for assault so society sees assault as worse, but to me, they deserve it, and I can't ever change my opinion on that.  I know it's archaic to think like that, and caveman like, but I've never been in a fight in my life, the only times I ever think it's ok is when someone actually does something to you that is worse.  My reasoning for this is , you teach that person a lesson, and hopefully in the future they will not repeat that mistake, if they go unpunished that kind of behaviour is seen as ""acceptable"" to some simply because there is no risk of backlash. But if there is a risk of backlash, then the behaviour should subside.   I do 100% see what you mean with it isn't right to assault someone, but I really do see a grey area where it is alright, and maybe I am a dumbass for thinking that, but I just don't like seeing people get away with doing things like that, its really not fair in my opinion.  There is nothing I could've legally done to him, he could've given me a disease and continued to cheat and lie to future partners, the law does nothing to stop that, and to me that is where the law is wrong. The government can't control everything, but maybe it should be illegal to not be discretionary about your cheating because it can spread disease. It's unfortunately a law that could never exist because proof would be required, and it would flood the justice system with false accusations.  But in my opinion, it should be illegal to do it, especially if you are at high risk to do so. If someone can get a ticket for speeding; risking getting into an accident and the odds are way LOWER than spreading disease, why can't they get in trouble for potentially giving someone a life threatening infection. I know you don't have the answer, but thats how I see it.  The speeding ticket isn't for actually hurting anyone, it is because you potentially could've hurt someone, it is the choice to disregard other peoples lives that is being punished not actualy harming anyone. People who do things that can potentially hurt another person should be punished regardless if they successfully hurt them because there will be a time when they actually do hurt someone else. The speeding ticket is incentive to not speed again and to not potentially get into a car accident, it's a ""hypothetical"" punishment, that I agree with. Again it's the act of disregard that is being punished, not actual harm.  It's just blatant disregard for other peoples lives, and to me that is enough to be illegal. It's just too ""he said"" ""she said"", when it comes to something like that which is why it never will be.  Cheating shouldn't be illegal, but not telling your partner who you've slept with should be because it affects lives.  If people weren't allowed to cheat without telling their partners, a lot less people would be contracting disease. Again my boyfriend has two friends that got HIV from their cheating partners, and absolutely nothing was done because of this mentality. The cheaters got away scotch free, and limited the lives of their victims, but they never were punished. This perpetuates the idea that it is ok.  So maybe me assaulting him isn't the best idea, but until there is a law protecting ME from people like HIM, I am going to have to agree that he deserves and should be punched out.   Again I know it's juvenile to think this way, and I most likely wouldn't act on my feelings, but it just isn't justifiable to me to be able to do that legally as well.  Maybe publicly shaming them for what they did is good enough, I really just don't believe they should get away with it, and unfortunately a fist to the face is the only way I can think of showing them they were wrong since I can't legally do anything about it. I think it shouldn't be allowed."

But so far it has not worked for me because the part of ME that is not accepting of MY being gay agrees with these gossiping hateful people. So I can brush off the other things. But I'm vulnerable to their hostility toward 'gay' because I have my own irrationality about this. I know it's really fucked up.  But I understand that this is a goal I must try to achieve.

askgaybros,3dv0n8,your_worries,2,Sun Jul 19 23:46:34 2015 UTC,"For me, this sort of anxiety would be best dealt with by confronting it head on (though it's certainly not easy). Actually do the thing I fear, and so far, my anxiety was always much worse than doing the actual thing. It's not like it gets rid of the anxiety, but now I have something concrete that I can confront it with. (e.g. i had an anxiety about making an appointment with my cardiologist, thinking she'd chew me out for not going there for almost two years when I should be going every six months, but when I gathered the courage to make the call, she was okay, and didn't even mention the absence. So the next time I'll call, I can calm myself down somewhat with this memory.)  In your case, it could be finding some gay group (PFLAG or similar group, or some hiking/sports group that's either explicitly for gay people or one that is gay people friendly). In that case, you can logically know that they're accepting, they won't spread the information (especially the PFLAG-like groups)."

askgaybros,3dv0n8,TricksterT,3,Sun Jul 19 23:00:49 2015 UTC,"I remember feeling like this. It's entirely understandable, too. Being straight is pretty much ""Life on Easy Mode"", and when you feel terrible, wanting to have things be easier is totally normal.  It took me some time, but I think what helped me is realising although my life is harder, I'm a better person for it. Imagine if I never examined how I felt about gay people? Imagine if I had lived my life on easy? I would have, fundamentally been a worse person because I would never have to confront the ideas that make me uncomfortable. I would have been ignorant and careless, which, to me, was far more of an evil to me than anything else. So, because of that, I am glad to be gay.  This might not be your approach - I don't know how you see the world. But my worldview is something that helped me come to terms with being gay.  What I want to know is why you don't want to be gay? It's clear you feel bad about it, but... why not gay? Why straight?"
askgaybros,3dv0n8,TricksterT,2,Sun Jul 19 20:57:20 2015 UTC,"I am so grateful to you for writing this.  As far as my life being more difficult so it makes me a better person:  I have considered this idea too. But it always makes me think of he saying: Suffering makes the soul grow.  But my response to that is that if that's true, then my soul is already 100 miles in height. Enough already !!  Yes, I'm sure my own trouble has made me more compassionate. But   I would be more than glad to give that up to be a happy person.  You ask why I would want to be straight, not gay.  There are many reasons.  I feel deprived of a ""normal life"" with all that includes.   Some of that are major things but some are just little ones.  For example -   A straight guy sees a beautiful woman on the street and he feels no need to hide that he's attracted to her.  But if I see a great looking guy on the street, I do feel the need to hide my attraction to him.  I'm just picking that example at random. But there are so many more.  I do want to say that the recent legalization of gay marriage in all 50 states meant a lot to me.  Thank you again"
askgaybros,3dv0n8,unsureguy2015,2,Sun Jul 19 21:23:53 2015 UTC,"No probs, bob.  If it helps, for that small example, appreciating dudes in public is nowhere near as obvious as you think it is.  And if you're worried about being seen as ""gross"" for checking out dudes - women feel this about men all the time, unless the feeling is mutual. And boy, when the feeling is mutual IT IS SO GREAT.  You've probably been over this with your psych so many times, but brains lie so much. No-one cares nearly as much as you think, but our brains are wired to think otherwise. It's so rough that we can't just say HERE, THE DATA SAYS YOU'LL BE FINE and have you be fine.  What's awesome is you are looking for help. You're getting there. Go you!  And it's obvious and cheesy but: Those who mind don't matter, and those who matter won't mind."
askgaybros,3dv0n8,Aether911,2,Sun Jul 19 21:40:27 2015 UTC,"For me to have posted this on Ask Gay Bros is a pretty big step. I have never done something like this before. Your responses mean so much to me, you have no idea."
askgaybros,3dv0n8,LGBTLibrarian,3,Sun Jul 19 21:54:11 2015 UTC,"I know the feeling. I was in the closet for twenty years before I finally accepted reality. Deep down, I knew I was gay, but I got too damned good at hiding it. I started to believe my own lies about myself. It was shame leading to denial. Up until the day I came out, I thought the worst thing in the world would have been someone finding out.  Even after coming out, there were mornings I'd wake up and my first thought was ""I hate being gay. And now everybody knows. Fuck."" But those mornings became fewer and fewer, and each day, I became more confident and decided to embrace the gay. I now get frustrated when people don't know! I think I am a better person because I am gay. I know what it means to be in the minority. I am more tolerant and compassionate because I am gay!  So to answer your question, I got over my shame, depression, and self-loathing by coming out. Sunlight, as they say, is the best disinfectant. I never understood the concept of gay pride until after I came out.   Think about it this way: you're carrying such a massive burden simply by hiding who you are. Think about how much more simple (maybe not easier, but simpler), life will be when you're not burdening yourself with that huge secret!  (Come out when you're safe to do so... Only you know the right time. But coming out freed me from all of what you're describing!)"
askgaybros,3dv0n8,BrobearBerbil,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:15:16 2015 UTC,"Your answer brought tears to my eyes. I am really moved by what you said.  You said one thing I would really want you to explain  Each morning you would say ""I hate being gay. And now everybody knows. Fuck."" But those mornings became fewer and fewer, and each day..""  What I want to know is - How did that happen ? What was happening in your thoughts or in your feelings that made it keep decreasing ?  You have no idea how grateful I am for your response."
askgaybros,3dv0n8,BrobearBerbil,2,Sun Jul 19 21:39:01 2015 UTC,"Honestly, that's a hard one to answer... But I think for me, it just happened in time.  I didn't sleep for three days right after coming out. My mind was racing: ""holy shit! I said it! What the hell did I just do?! How is So-n-So going to take the news? Shit shit shit!""  But then, as the answers to those questions came, it started to become less of a big deal. My self-loathing thoughts at that point were becoming more about me not being able to find a boyfriend, than about actually hating that I was gay. The joke I made with my friends that after coming out, was that I now got to deal with ""normal"" problems, like dating and such, rather than trying to keep my secret.   Coming out won't solve everything. But you won't have to deal with your problems alone anymore. You can tell people why you're frustrated being gay, and they'll be able to help you, even if it's just by listening... Amazing how effective venting can be!  Again, it takes time. I fought that monster for twenty years on my own. Even after you slay the beast by coming out, you'll still have to allow time for your wounds to heal. But give yourself the time. After fighting this hard, don't cheat yourself from your victory!"

In the book, he talks about the various stages of how gay people accept with being gay and eventually find acceptance.   There is dozens of similar stories in the book similar to yours and how the people overcame them. Or they didnt, what held them back. There is a very similar story to yours in it, about a guy who was constantly depressed. He was depressed because he didnt know what made him happy. Once he identified what made him happy, his depression subsided.  It appears you are too fixated on finding acceptance, that its consuming your entire life. Where as you are probably better enjoying life. Accept being gay gradually and indirectly(It doesnt happen over night or even within in months. It takes a lot of time for people)."

askgaybros,3dv0n8,axclover,2,Sun Jul 19 20:57:13 2015 UTC,"When I first started to fool around with my first boyfriend, I felt really  terrible about it, it was quite strange how something as simple as cuddling him could feel both so right and so wrong at the same time. Afterwards, I would always isolate myself because I needed to go cry somewhere. I felt shameful and guilty and it continued for a time. It changed when I spent holidays at his place, just the two of us. I realised then that it definitely wasn't lust, or some misguided behaviour, nothing wrong or shameful, just two people loving each other, like any other couple. So yeah, if I have any advice, don't make a fuss about it and, as hard as it sound, try to ignore your shame and live with it, eventually you'll realise there is nothing to be ashamed of."

One thing that helps a lot is spending times with other gay men like you that have a good head on their shoulders. Some things only sink in as good and valid with real life exposure and experience.  I highly recommend finding more gay friends you can relax with and have real fun with. Find a retreat or a hiking group or something positive where negative perceptions won't be reinforced by the haphazard hookup crowd (there are still good people in that group, but their are also quite a few chasing sex to fix their own hangups)."

askgaybros,3dwyiy,DiversityOfThoughts,3,Mon Jul 20 06:00:31 2015 UTC,"If you're unwilling to date someone who might become unattractive to you, you might as well not date anyone.

If the guy has somehow let himself go in an unusual way, and this really bothers you, then I'd not pursue it any further. However, I hope you realise that everyone lets themselves go eventually."

It's just a matter of being attracted enough at the start. I feel like it may be hard to fully invest myself in something if I don't feel a strong enough attraction to them early on; at that point, it's hard to distinguish the relationship from typical friendships"

askgaybros,3dwyiy,RepressedMemoryAnnie,-1,Tue Jul 21 09:43:50 2015 UTC,"I think many of us have sex with someone first to determine the sexual compatibility. Sexual attraction depends on a range of factors. Physical appearance is only part of that. There are many other factors that also play a role in a healthy, active and fun sex life with your partner. The guy you end up with may surprise you."
askgaybros,3dwyiy,BuckTheFuckNaked,1 point,Mon Jul 20 06:22:26 2015 UTC,"I've always been pretty reserved with sex, for better or worse. I think it's partly due to the fact that I was raised in a religious household and I believed sex was only for marriage, etc...   Obviously I don't go by that anymore, but I can't bring myself to enjoy any kind of casual sex. I only enjoy sex when I'm in a relationship (or I've gone on a few great dates with the guy). So I guess it'd be tougher for me to use that method."
askgaybros,3dwyiy,EnForgeant,-1,Mon Jul 20 06:30:14 2015 UTC,"I don't want to get off topic, but it's not really casual sex if you're thinking of perhaps having a relationship with the guy. Sexual compatibility is a freaking huge issue for gay men. No matter what he looks like, you won't be happy at all if the sex doesn't work out. Many guys who don't meet our sometimes perfectionist views of a handsome guy turn out to be sexy as hell once the lights are out. Handsome guys are not all good lovers; not all the good lovers are handsome guys."
askgaybros,3dwyiy,chnflip,4,Mon Jul 20 06:36:15 2015 UTC,Just tell him you're not interested. It's obvious comparable interests aren't that important to you and looks are so just keep it real.
askgaybros,3dwyiy,shanthology,2,Mon Jul 20 06:05:36 2015 UTC,"Well the interests are important -- that's one of the reasons I still feel inclined to go on the date, because I know we'd have a lot to connect on.   I'm just afraid that they won't be everything and looks do, unfortunately, have an impact on how we develop relationships."
askgaybros,3dwyiy,pensivegargoyle,3,Mon Jul 20 06:08:46 2015 UTC,"Go on the date anyway. He might look nicer in person. And if not, well, if you have a lot of common interests you might make a new friend."
askgaybros,3dwyiy,Ryuushin,2,Mon Jul 20 06:42:52 2015 UTC,"If you think he deliberately put up old photos because he's since gained weight or something like that, that's a really dishonest thing to do and it reflects badly on him as a person. I would break it off and tell him why so he knows not to do that stuff again. And this is coming from a guy that prefers thicker guys. Being deceptive and shady and reeking of low self-esteem (which putting up old pics is) is such a huge turnoff.  If all the pics are recent, but it's just a difference in angles or lighting or something like that...I would suggest giving it a shot. Who knows which pics are more accurate? Most pictures I take I look terrible in because I'm awful at smiling on cue. So only a handful actually ""look like me."" So no obligation morally to give it a shot, but you might be pleasantly surprised. :)"
askgaybros,3dwyiy,dcjosh,3,Mon Jul 20 16:25:05 2015 UTC,Just go for a date. That's the point of going on a date anyway --- getting to know the person more. You're not required to marry him after one date. What's the worst thing that could happen?
askgaybros,3dwyiy,wandering-blade,1 point,Mon Jul 20 11:31:12 2015 UTC,Just tell him you're more interested in finding friends right now and that if it turns into more than that you're open to it. If you have a lot in common you may at least make a new friend out of it.

And that only if he messages you first. If he doesn't, then just don't message him at all and hope he doesn't reach out to you. The mutual ghost."
askgaybros,3dwyiy,wooeee,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:43:50 2015 UTC,"I hope this doesn't become one of my more controversial posts, but this is the approach I've found that spares everyone's feelings the most (note: anecdotal).  The reality is that people use pictures that make them look as good as possible, which means they sometimes use old pictures. Sometimes, they're being deceptive (e.g. if their appearance has changed significantly); sometimes, they're just maximizing their appearance. But here's the key thing: if you've seen his most recent pictures and don't find him attractive anymore, then you have no obligation and should feel no guilt if you choose to see him or not.  Personally, I disagree with the sentiment of ""oh, I'll just give him a chance. Maybe his personality will be amazing, etc."" That's true, it may be great! But in my (admittedly anecdotal, but mildly extensive) experience, there are a few problems with this:  1) There isn't enough time to date everyone with similar interests to you. You need to use some kind of filter, and attractiveness is a reasonable choice. There are plenty of fish in the see, and you can choose to date someone who you both find attractive AND has similar interests to you. So, don't feel bad about turning people down for dates if you're not attracted. But if you think you could be friends, go for it! That being said...  2) This person may end up being a good friend, but there's no reason you need to find new friends by meeting this person (who, as we said above, may have been deceptive) instead of someone else met through an entirely different context. You have no obligation to be friends with everyone you encounter (including dates), and you can choose to make friends through other means.  Personally, I think ghosting is bad manners. If you want to turn him down, just be straight-forward and polite: ""Hey, after thinking about it a bit more, I don't think we'd be a good fit. But I wish you the best of luck moving forward!"" If you want to turn someone down, but it feels awkward/uncomfortable, remember that going on a date with him does not spare his feelings. Unless it goes extremely well (and you end up being friends or more), the date will either be awkward (you essentially turn him down immediately after meeting him) or more painful later (he thinks it went well, then gets crushed later) and will definitely be a waste of both of your times.    tl;dr: Don't date people you're not attracted to. Consider a friendship, but don't feel obligated to go (you can make friends other ways). Turn people down directly and politely. I'm not an expert, this is anecdotal, and I don't know him, you, or anyone else for that matter."
askgaybros,3dwyiy,wooeee,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:24:39 2015 UTC,"I would just say that you're not interested in meeting anymore. I wouldn't say why or how, because you don't want to be mean or rude, and I would stand him up because thats just mean, nobody wants that to happen to them. If he asks why or for a reason just say you're not interested. Simple as that. If he wants more and keeps harassing just ask him to stop messaging you and you're not interested. Just don't be mean or rude, thats all I have to say about it."

askgaybros,3dwyiy,wooeee,3,Mon Jul 20 05:53:51 2015 UTC,"He gained weight, his face...thickened? His older photos are leaner, with more angular features features in his face; in his new photos his face is more full I guess, the angular features aren't prominent. It just looks like a different facial shape. I'm not sure if he gained weight or if it's just the natural progression of face-aging as you get older.  Also his haircut was better and now it's... not flattering.  Edit: No idea how to word this to explain properly, and it just sounds super bitchy of me. He just doesn't quite look like the same person when you compare the pictures; he looks like the (less attractive) brother of the first pictures -- familiar, similar, but not the same. He's not unattractive, just not quite what I'm attracted to."

Even being bisexual myself, there are a handful of fantasies I occasionally entertain involving stuff I either wouldn't actually do, or I know likely won't ever happen. You don't need anyone to give you permission to play around with things inside your own head, except yourself.

You could very easily be a straight guy who has strange wet dreams. Just because I once dreamed I slept with my therapist, does not mean my conscious brain wants to sleep with my therapist. )It really, really doesn't. No soul-searching needed.) There's also the case that you might just have a ""dream guy"" or guys.  And that's entirely fine. ""Heteroflexible"", if you would like to use that term, simply means, ""Straight until the complete right circumstances strike me"". Those circumstances might be your dreams/fantasies.

I don't think you need to be concerned or overcomplicating things. Enjoy your fantasies, and don't act on them in reality if you don't think you would enjoy them. We've all got a couple of fantasies like that."

askgaybros,3dvqrm,dessert-er,1 point,Mon Jul 20 10:40:13 2015 UTC,"Maybe this is your subconscious telling you to experiment. But you don't have to read too much into these fantasies if you don't want to. Your intense physical response to gay fantasies shows that neurologically you are to some degree at least heteroflexible--mostly straight but able to accommodate or even enjoy homosexual experiences in the right conditions.  So it's your choice. You can simply ignore these gay fantasies and go on with your perfectly honky-dory straight life. Or you could dig a little deeper into these gay fantasies and ask yourself if this means you might be bi.   If I were you I would pick the second option, only because it seems like way more fun and exciting. If I suddenly started to have sexual fantasies about women I would get on that because it's new and different and therefore exciting.   Do you feel like anything is missing when you date girls? It didn't sound like anything was when you described your time with your last girlfriend. If you were gay and dating a girl you would feel like something was missing. You might just be bi-curious.     Like that i just am in such deep denial that i don't even realize it myself. I'm scared of starting a new relationship because i feel like i'll disappoint a future girlfriend because i didn't know myself well enough.   These are very reasonable fears. The only way to find out definitively is to experiment. Just cultivate an open-mind and free yourself of any preconceived notion about yourself. You should give yourself space to grow and to fuck up."
askgaybros,3dvqrm,Ijustwanttosleepnow,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:21:46 2015 UTC,"One thing to look into is the notion that people can be bisexual, but heteroromantic. That is, their sex interest can go either way, but they only fall in love with the opposite sex.  When people split up romantic orientation and sexual orientation, it can be easier to understand the difference in those drives. I think most fully gay guys, that are both homoromantic and homosexual, feel much clearer feeling of bonding and wanting to be closer to other males much earlier. Like, sleeping next to your friend would have kept most young gay men up all night hoping he barely moved his arm over to feel it on theirs. It wouldn't be all about the sex, but the intimacy would be such a strong draw."

I'm finishing college in about a year, I recently got myself a high paying job, I live well, I spend money on clothes and stuff to look better, recently I've started going to the gym so I can be more fit than average people.

Second, other than work, do you have any hobbies or sports you like to do in your spare time?  You mentioned working out.  Maybe find a gym in the gay part of Vancouver where you are more likely to meet someone that does similar activities. Finally, there must be some gay groups for those under 25 in the area you live.  Find the gay community center and go to one of those groups.  Yes, there will be flamboyant people there, but don't let that deter you from meeting the guys that are more what you are looking for.  Plus, you can have a conversation there without it being about sex. The only other thing you might want to consider that is holding you back is that you (at least in my opinion) have some internal homophobia you are dealing with.  Yes you are out and have accepted yourself, but you still look down on more obvious gay people.  That is an attitude you likely grew up around and will have to think about to overcome. Best of luck to you.  The main thing is don't give up.  Taking action is the best way to get past loneliness and depression."
askgaybros,3dvqk9,toddmiami,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:19:25 2015 UTC,"I've thought about the ignorance is bliss part recently actually. It came up when I was talking to my best friend about these kind of problems I feel.  He just seemed completely oblivious to how I could feel any of the things I feel or said I felt. And it made me think that maybe people just don't realize.  He said we go out and do things because we enjoy doing things together. I agreed, but for instance with going to a bar or pub. Yes, we went with the outward motivation to hang out and spend time together. But the thing that made you all enjoy it that much more and stay and have fun was the girls you can flirt and talk to while you are there. I don't have this opportunity. It makes me feel isolated and lesser.  I just feel like they are completely oblivious to all the small things that make their life easier to feel included and part of.  I just find it sad sometimes that no one knows anything I do in a week, how I'm feeling, etc. but I know all about them. Everyone seems willing to share their lives with me, but no one wants to listen to mine. Which just makes me feel used when people need me.  I know I'm dealing with internal homophobia, but I don't feel like it will ever go away. Until I feel like I can be completely part of and included with the majority of the population, and mainly, my friends, I will always resent myself for being gay.  I just feel like all the interesting and aspirational people that I would want to meet aren't going to be at these groups, as they wouldn't need to be at them. They would be out with their friends doing things, etc.  Maybe I should just accept defeat and try these clubs or something. Last time I went to one I never made it into the door because I broke down crying. My friends are enjoying themselves living their lives, and I'm alone going to some random gay club on the other side of town alone. I never made it inside."

Combining usage of the two makes it exceptionally unlikely that HIV could ever be contracted.)"
askgaybros,3dvs33,RandyFMcDonald,2,Mon Jul 20 03:01:50 2015 UTC,"I've met some poz guys who swear up and down they only had protected sex, and I see no reason to doubt them.  There's a study last year from Canada that estimated a slight majority of new HIV infections in gay men in Ontario occurred in sex acts with condoms.   The proportion of HIV infections related to condom failure appears substantial and higher than previously thought. That 51% of transmissions occur despite condom use may be conservative (i.e. low) since we used a relatively high estimate (87.1%) for condom effectiveness. If condom effectiveness were closer to 70%, a value estimated from a recent CDC study, the number and proportion of HIV transmissions occurring despite condom use would be much higher. Therefore, while condom use should continue to be promoted and enhanced, this alone is unlikely to stem the tide of HIV infection among MSM.   -- http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0107540  The ugly truth is even used correctly condoms are only like 75 - 90% effective."
askgaybros,3dvs33,indomante,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:26:55 2015 UTC,Yep. Even right now on the front page the guy who just got the diagnosis says the same thing.      https://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/3dvci9/got_the_diagnosis/
askgaybros,3dvs33,linuxjava,4,Mon Jul 20 13:11:08 2015 UTC,"If you're talking anal yes it is realistic enough, as it says in this CDC article condoms are about 80% effective in reducing HIV transmission, and that's just on heterosexual couples, for homosexual with anal tearing is probably more likely. I believe the reason being is it likely fails due to user error. Receiving as you can read is the most likely way to get HIV, if the top has HIV and no condoms used you have a 138/10000 chance, aka 1.38% chance to get HIV. Which might seem small at first but imagine in a larger scale/ per sex act manner, 100 sex act of the similar nature means you statistically could have reasonably gotten it (I did the math and its 75% chance at 100, it approaches 100% around 300, its around 90% at 200).  Of course the caveat of all this is the person has HIV and is in the point where transmission is more likely. And the condom's 80% effectiveness always happened.   So I'll run the math with the new 80% effectiveness assuming you always use a condom bottoming. AKA 138/10000*.2(.2 chance the condom broke or failed if you're the statistical average user) = 0.276 %, which is better but when you run the analysis you see...  100 sex acts with HIV tops, with condoms gives 25% chance to get HIV. 200 gives 42%. 300 gives 56%. 1000 gives 93%.  So yes with condom HIV is still scary, especially as a bottom, and assuming the top has HIV and is viral. With these statistics you can see how the AIDs epidemic really took off in a period of unbridled sexual liberation.  Don't use these numbers to hide in a bunker though, these numbers only apply if you're bottom to a HIV top who's virility is high. If I had the statistic of the chance a random gay man has HIV who is very viral I can tell you the absolute probability of you contracting HIV, then again remember lot's of things alter the statistics of ""does your partner have HIV"". Like if your sexual partner is someone who's going to bathouses every weekend for a good old fashioned bathhouse gangbang without condoms obviously that partner has a more likely chance than an 18 year old who truly just came out and is a total virgin (though younger guys have higher incidence of transmission so don't think younger=safer, seems middle age is safer iirc). Of course when hooking up you can never truly know or trust the status of the individual so you learn to trust your instinct on this sorta thing and hope the statistics fall on your favor if your instinct is wrong and he does have HIV, or go on PrEP maybe if feasible and you're having a ravenous amount of bottoming sex, though still use condoms if so.   Sorry for going on so long I like reading about statistics and running analysis on them."
askgaybros,3dvs33,jpofreddit,3,Mon Jul 20 01:03:37 2015 UTC,"I am fairly confident the reported effectiveness rating for condoms is not a per act chance, but rather a measure of how effective they are for an average person over the course of the year. So I'm not sure that statistical calculation reflects the true risks.   That said, I'm neither a sexual health expert, nor a statistics expert."
askgaybros,3dvs33,zedelghem,2,Mon Jul 20 03:30:11 2015 UTC,That is correct.    It also counts times they're not used in the total and those resulting pregnancies which messes the true efficacy rates up; it's more the rate if you use condoms about as regularly as the average person does.    When used consistently and properly the effectiveness is much nearer 100%.
askgaybros,3dvs33,Mo77019,-1,Mon Jul 20 05:48:09 2015 UTC,"This is why PrEP is so damned important.  Efficacy is like 93 - 97% when taken correctly, which is much better than condoms.  People are worried about guys barebacking on PrEP...frankly we'd be better off when it comes to HIV if they did!  But don't do that, use them together.  In combination with condoms, it offers a real hope at ending the epidemic."

And it has two added bonuses: it can make you feel better with yourself, and curb the weight loss.  B could also be your C, but if not, you can actually also start doing it at the same time.  E will most likely come along while you're taking care of the rest.  So, A, B, C, and D can probably be done at the same time. If you have to prioritize, though, I'd go with A and D, then B and C.

First I will need to set up an appointment with my GP, I would do this by email but they seem to only do this via phone so it might take some months to years until I make a call. Then I go there and I am most probably on the hypochondriacs list of their praxis already anyway and have to explain what bothers me and that I think it would be good if I could get a referral. Then she makes the referral and I will have to schedule a new appointment with this new person or maybe I didn't get this far in the first place. Then I must call because if I don't it's going to be weird but most probably I will end up waiting. Then I go there and bla bla everything and go and maybe I realize nothing is going to change anyway. And it goes on and on while I could just be doing nothing instead. Just thinking about the whole procedure is draining.  I don't think that B will be my C ever but then again I wonder what kind of hobby I should have anyway. I guess I might have to sort out A before C so that I will find at least something not boring but maybe I also should just start any hobby first to have enough energy to get into therapy. So yeah I don't know."

We can't physically force you to do stuff, and you know you need to do it. Just pick up the phone, and not even think about it. Or muster up all of your remaining courage, and pick up the phone.  The first step has to come from you, and you know what the alternative to picking up the phone is, in the long run.  As I said before, good luck!"

askgaybros,3dxans,pensivegargoyle,2,Mon Jul 20 14:00:13 2015 UTC,"Actually, the medications themselves don't cause weight gain. It's been proven time and again that people are bad at estimating their food intake, especially if dealing with mental health issues. The studies on medication and weight gain all detail the fact that metabolisms are not very low after being tested while taking the medication and that the patient's food intake was self-reported. Psychiatrists hypothesize that the change in mood some drugs cause allow people to experience more joy in life, and many people have an emotional connection to food.    If you're that afraid of weight gain, Wellbutrin is not associated with weight gain. I was on it for two years and had very good results with it, but it takes 3-4 weeks to take full effect. Regardless, it's better to be chubby than wanting to kill yourself. :-/    Good luck, bro."

Your best bet is to just tell him what you explained here. Just let him know that you want to take care of your personal projects for awhile. But don't cut off all contact. At the very least, give him a ""hello"" text. The main thing that I've noticed in this phenomenon is that the man will go silent for weeks without talking to the guy and that is what can kill the chemistry before it began to sprout.   Just be upfront. ""I really enjoy hanging out with you but I need to have insert days here to complete a few projects"".   It's a little hard but try and make it up to him after you get your projects done and the trip is over. Plan something fun and engaging so you two can bond a bit again. Good luck!"

You don't need no man.    The advice that will actually help you as a gay man and will make me look like an asshole: love yourself for your non-physical attributes (I can tell you're very intelligent after reading this), but do the following things:    Get a haircut.    Lose like 50 lbs.    Never straighten your hair again.    Start lifting weights.    I hope you are mentally strong enough to not internalize this advice too much and don't take it too personally. You have the face of a total gay hottie (your eyes are GORGEOUS), but the truth is that staying fat as a gay man comes with undeserving social consequences.    plz don't h8 me :-/    This is just the terrible, superficial world we live in. Someone WILL love you for who you are inside, but gay men tend to not get to that part until something about your appearance attracts them first.    And if you'd rather not do those things I suggested, that's okay too. It just makes the hunt for the one much, much, much, much, much more difficult. I know from experience.    Also, more I want to add about inexperience: I'm 22 and have never had a boyfriend. My first kiss was when I was 17 and the guy dropped out of school the next day and hasn't spoken to me since. I have never been fucked (therefore I consider myself a virgin). I've only made out with two people. Everyone is on a different sexual path and, in fact, studies prove most kids actually lie about the fact they had sex in high school and there is actually no such thing as hookup culture! Most college aged kids aren't having as much sex as we previously thought. Don't put a timeline on your sexual development. Let it take its course naturally and never feel ashamed that your peers may have done stuff sooner than you."

Typically people say one month for each year of a relationship to heal.  It took me about that formula to get over my last relationship ending.  Focus on yourself, workout, do yoga, spend time with friends, learn a new hobby.  Repair another relationship (a cousin, a friend?) that maybe you've been neglecting."
askgaybros,3dufhr,shitsureishimasu,2,Sun Jul 19 17:54:52 2015 UTC,"one month for each year of a relationship?  maybe that's true for someone you weren't deeply in love with.  I've heard half the time that you were with some one (so a 5 yr relationship takes 2.5 yrs to emotionally heal).  My ex-partner of 3.5 yrs left me last Christmas and then announced in March he was in a relationship with someone else.  I'm still grieving, and hurting . . . some good days and  some really fucking awful days.  Last night was one of those-- trying to fall asleep without him there, after going to a good friend's wedding (a gay couple) where the loss was brought so close to me, that I finally had to leave the reception early."
askgaybros,3dufhr,Zoomjet3,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:11:07 2015 UTC,"Well, everyone's mileage may vary.  For example, your ex of 3.5 years took 3 months to be in a new relationship.

The pronunciation shouldn't be a problem. The good thing about spanish is that, different from English, you pronounce the word as it is written. There are just a few thing that you need to take into consideration, but having the basics I think you already know them.   Apart from that, nothing to be said. Reading may be the best tool. It will help you with your vocabulary and also with your syntax. Sooner or later you will realise that english and spanish are really different in that."

askgaybros,3dsr9g,360Saturn,9,Sun Jul 19 05:30:38 2015 UTC,"Thinking back to times I have been slut shamed there was jealousy involved, but that is anectdotal.    I think the general consensus is that sex shaming is a learned behavior. The men in our lives slut shamed their wives and girlfriends and this idea of morality is ingrained in our psyche.   While there is a clear difference in attitude in the straight world against the ¨stud¨ and the ¨slut,¨ the lines are a bit blurred in the gay community.  Those gender stereotypes do not necessarily apply.    People then subconsciously try to fit tops and bottoms into the male or female sexual role.  I am sure we have all been asked the offensive question of which is the boy and which is the girl. Hence more slut shaming against bottoms due to preconceived notions of them being the submissive individual.    Furthermore society looks at gay sex as being dirtier and more subversive than straight sex.  This makes a higher likelihood that someone would carry a negative internal sentiment towards gay sex in general and channel that to people with multiple partners.  It is on us then to remind our gay brothers and sisters that slut is a word that does not apply to a man, and that we are above that and have a prime opportunity to love as we please.

The only time slut should be used is if someone wants to call themself that - or maybe as an in-joke between friends where there's an understanding it's not serious.

askgaybros,3dsr9g,omnichronos,3,Sun Jul 19 03:03:07 2015 UTC,"McDavitt, Bryce, and Matt G. Mutchler. “‘Dude, You’re Such a Slut!’ Barriers and Facilitators of Sexual Communication Among Young Gay Men and Their Best Friends.” Journal of adolescent research 29.4 (2014): 464–498. PMC. Web. 25 Mar. 2015. [html]    Gay male friends sometimes spoke about unprotected sex in judgmental ways (e.g., calling a friend “slut” or “whore” for having sex without condoms). In some cases, this language could be used playfully, while in others it had the effect of shaming a friend and obstructing further communication about sexual risk. [...]   Seemingly judgmental language, such as “slut” and “whore,” when applied by young gay men to each other, may also be part of an interpersonal bonding process that helps to generate a sense of shared culture and connectedness. [...] Among young gay men in particular, it is possible that “playfully judgmental” talk may also serve to alleviate tension and discomfort within scripts for sexual communication by injecting humor into dialogue around themes that could otherwise provoke anxiety—namely, gay male sexuality, HIV, and mortality. [...]  However, hearing one’s friends called “slut” or “whore” in social contexts also implies that one’s peers actually are having sex with multiple partners. In this way, the same interpersonal script may also reinforce a descriptive norm suggesting that it is common to have many sex partners, and thus perhaps socially acceptable. “Playful judgmentalism” may thus have the effect of exposing and thereby affirming gay male sexuality.[...] Still, judgmental comments about sexual behavior may be “heard” by young gay men as an implicit confirmation of heterosexist social norms, even as their use in certain contexts may support opposite norms favoring sexual freedom."

As a result, they attack those, like myself, that enjoy it. I've never noticed the bottom vs top thing as far as ""slut shaming"" goes, but then I'm a top.

I knew I was attracted to males from before puberty. What caused me a lot of trouble, and made it hard for me to truly accept that I am gay, is the way sexuality is presented in our culture, as a binary, and how we talk about ""attraction"" in that binary. Sure, we all hear about the Kinsey scale in school, but we don't reflect that in art, culture, and popular discourse. That lead me to believe that if I can get an erection and engage in sexual activity with a woman, and if I find some women ""pretty"" then I must be bisexual. I figured I was ""attracted"" to both sexes. There's where the other problem that fucked me up for so long lies: the meaning of the word ""attraction."" In American English we use that one word to mean a whole range of things from sexual attraction, to romantic attraction, to just finding people pleasing to the eye, and everything in between. What finally clicked for me later in life, and after failed relationships with women, and even a failed marriage to a woman, is that I'm not ""attracted"" to women in a holistic sense. I don't desire to be with a woman romantically, or sexually. I can't have a real, deep, loving connection with a woman. I can look at a woman and say ""she's pretty"" but I would never intentionally seek out sex or a relationship or sex with one. I only had so long because it seemed like the path of least resistance. If I was bi, and could be with either gender, why not be with the one that's socially normal and easy for me?

askgaybros,3drzd5,kidfay,9,Sun Jul 19 02:03:11 2015 UTC,"I had a big thing typed out but then hit the wrong keys and the tab closed. It sounded like whining anyway.  I can easily imagine feeling romantic feelings toward women while I have lust feelings toward men. Generally I oscillate between feeling definitely gay and feeling like if I could get close enough to a woman things would work out and I could blend in.  I had an ugly childhood due to narcissistic and alcoholic parents. I always figured my feelings were reacting to my parents and given enough time and distance I'd relax enough that things would become normal. I grew up in a small town in the Midwest. There was one gay and he had major alcohol and drug problems. The jr high gym teacher was a lesbian. Everyone felt sad for her.  When I was in preschool I proposed marriage to a girl. I also had a huge crush on a boy. One day I asked my mom if you can love people outside your family. She said yes so I said I loved that boy. I don't remember what she said but it was negative. That was in preschool. I remember one time when I was in in jr high or high school there was something about Elton John in the news and she said something like ""It's so unfortunate that someone with that much talent..."" I don't have any gay relatives. Up through high school I told myself that I was admiring aspects of guys. I played sports in high school. Definitely liked seeing the guys.  I've been on dates with mostly men and a few women the last couple of years. With women I get all sorts of weird deja vu feelings like I'm watching my parents from their point of view. I can't get flirty at all with women. With guys after the first few moments things are relaxed and super easy. I've kissed only guys. When I kissed a guy for the first time it was like art, going to war, and the words in songs made sense at last. Being alone with a guy I pretty much have a continuous boner. When I was on dates with girls, I felt some flickers. When I masturbate it's usually a visualization of a guy. I'm not in my fantasies. My porn folder is mostly all guys with some guys doing girls. If someone were looking through my computer, they'd probably conclude it's the computer of a gay.  I told two friends I was gay three years ago. They were totally surprised. I don't identify with typical gay things at all. I'm an engineer. I lift weights, play records, and do stuff with power tools. I have no fashion sense and don't care about pop culture, celebrities, or theater stuff.  Still, I can't pull the trigger or take the plunge or whatever. Growing up with my parents the way they were, I think all my feelings and desires and much of my personality were invalidated and discouraged. I guess I don't get that you don't need any justification to seek a boyfriend other than simply wanting one because it feels good."

Maybe there's a pattern here..."") Having a crush is a kind of wishy-washy thing, and it's easy to deny what it is. (""Maybe I'm only getting these warm fuzzies because he's a good friend. No, I'm not staring at those adorable dimples."") Your mileage may vary, but for me the pornography thing was a catalyst for understanding that I was gay in real life."

I didn't realize I was gay until a guy went out of their way to flirt with me. That got me SUPER horny, far hornier than anything with my ex-girlfriend did. After a few months of that I fell in love with another guy friend of mine. I guess I never realized I liked guys because I always assumed I was more dominant, but I'm actually super subby. I was thinking about relationships backwards until then.  So my best guess is I'm gay. I honestly thought I was asexual until last year. It's been a huge relief to figure out I can actually become horny for someone."

I knew that this was right for me from then on. I'm not still with that person, but everything made sense after that."
askgaybros,3drzd5,androsken,6,Sun Jul 19 09:20:26 2015 UTC,"For some people I think it is simple, for others not so much.   I for a long time felt pressured to have a label. Gay. Straight. Honestly, I think labels are more important for other people than for yourself.  For me, I realized that I was attracted to guys at a young age. However, I did not ""come out"" until I was in graduate school. What pushed me out was the fact that I was living two lives. I felt that I had to decide on a label because I was having gay sex for the first time in my life but i was hiding it and my relationships from my friends. This duality was killing me.   nowadays I feel kind of trapped in my label. I'm not saying I don't find men attractive, I am just saying that unlike a lot of people, my sexuality isn't as clear cut. While I was in a long term relationship with a man, I am not 100% sure that gay is the label I identify with.  Again, some will scoff, but I think that it is important to just be yourself, what ever that is. I am still trying to do that every day."

Most will tailor their behavior when they see a negative consequence applied to specific behaviours. In the case of males, it might be getting a firm spanking from dad because he wanted a Barbie. It may be a mother telling him only girls where pink. Gendered language is actually very damaging and not just to LGBT children. It can lead to issues for straight children as well, such as expressing hypermasculinity or being the perpetrator of bullying."

askgaybros,3drzd5,bitemynipple,3,Sun Jul 19 05:25:23 2015 UTC,"I never really thought about it until one day in class in freshman year of high school I overheard some guy talking about how gay the other one was, how faggy he was being and whatever other homophobic nonsense he could think up at the moment. I was puzzled, I couldn't understand how anybody could be that mean for finding another a little different. I guess I was too innocent because by then I hadn't even fully wrapped my head around racism at all. I truly believed everyone just wanted to get along with everyone else all the time and that these problems were either transient or superficial.  So later that day I was home browsing the internet on my very first computer. I had been using it all the time now for the couple months since I'd bought it, doing all sorts of things. It wasn't the first time I had looked up porn but I did know I was very curious about other guys. I hadn't learned what masturbation was yet, and well, being the pubescent boy I was and suffering through those terrible dial-up day, I was happy if I could find anything at all. I got lucky and found an entirely male porn site this time behind a pay wall. I had reluctantly used the word gay in the search query. Sadly all I got was semi-nudes with the bits I wanted to see all covered up. It was annoying but I was ecstatic and eager to look around.  At some point I had wound down enough from searching without finding a full grown dick to compare my own with. It was honest curiosity. The thrill of the moment had subsided and at that moment the nasty boy from school came to mind. I still didn't get everything he had said then. Was all of that hatred normal? He hated the other guy for liking guys? Wait, I think I'm doing exactly what he had criticized. I froze up for a second and then I panicked. My heart raced, my blood drained my face, I felt sweaty. I couldn't believe it, but in what seemed like an eternity of recalling a younger me, I could see it, I had liked men disproportionally more than women all along! It seemed like the only time I liked girls was when other people encouraged it but deep down all those dreams I had until this point made sense.  That somehow managed to calm me down enough and as soon as I did I thought to myself that, fine, maybe it's just one person out of so many who doesn't like gay people, right? If I were to be gay...? No, wait--too sudden. What if I was gay for like a minute or maybe an hour? What if was gay for like a whole day? Could I handle a week?  So I sat back, somewhat calmly, and with a deep breath to gather my wits I accepted being gay for just one minute. I was it, I was gay. Something was about to happen, surely. And nothing did. Ok, maybe if I take my mind off it while being totally gay doing something else because maybe it takes a while to set in. I got to playing video games and seemed to forget it entirely until the hour was up. Oddly enough all I could feel was that I was still me and that felt really good.  I never looked back since. What I got out of it was more than a self-realization. I had understood what had happened: I had discovered empathy by immersing myself at my own pace. I learned not only that I was gay but that simultaneously I had learned to be an ally to my own community and didn't know it yet, and now looking back on it, that feels really good too."

I had been in deep denial until then. If the thought of questioning my sexuality ever crossed my mind I would refuse to have an internal discussion with myself about it. If I was watching porn I would always concentrate on the women. I have a small family and felt that I needed to have kids so that I wasn't alone in my later years. But this message directly Challanged me and for the first time I had that discussion with myself and realised that I had been lying to myself my whole life.

I used to have this notion in my head that being straight was how the world worked and that homosexuality was this mythical beast that didn't exactly exist or if it did it was simply not the correct way to be. I kept these thoughts to myself of course I wasn't out throwing bricks at people at a pride parade but this was how I felt. Anyway for years I would shoehorn myself into the heterosexuality and it just didn't feel natural. Women didn't excite me at all, in fact I am actually pretty turned off by them and am rather untrusting of them. And It used to tear me up inside how conflicted I was about them. I tried meeting women but it never got off the ground. And the it dawned on me one day that this was because I didn't have any meaningful feelings for any of them. I was going through the motions vainly foolishly thinking it would work out in the end.  Anyway after a few nights of crying thinking I was never going to be in a relationship because I was some kind of creature without a sexuality  I started looking at other possibilities and some dates with guys here, and some online messaging and phone calls there, and some council long here on sexualities and this is where I am. Truth be told I broke down and cried a few times when I first started to explore homosexuality from how very real it felt to me. Flirting felt good and going on dates and it made me feel incredible just spending time with another guy like that. I'm still single but one day I'd like to be in a relationship."

This can be for a number of reasons, from both partners not being fully on board, to the cheating at not being about having multiple partners, but rather about the thrill of the cheat.  That may very well be what's happening here. It's not sleeping with other guys that's turning his crank,cheating with other guys could be providing a thrill that's what he's into.

He needs to learn how to make nutritious meals quickly. He needs to learn how to budget exercise in his day. He needs to learn that a healthy lifestyle isn't a two week project: but a lifelong commitment.  He's better off using this time in college: arguably the least time-pressed he'll ever be in his whole life, to build these habits. Otherwise, the minute life ramps back up, his lifestyle will go back to shit.  Edit: Here are some positive goals. Encourage him to pick one up and try to maintain it for a month (about how long it takes to build a habit). Then add another one.    Cardio for 15 minutes; 5 times a week (even if it's just walking) Cut out a junk food (soda/sugary foods/Twinkies) Mindful meditation every night    etc.  By the end of the year, he'll not only be on his way to better health, but also have found how to manage it during his day."

askgaybros,3dsqet,pensivegargoyle,4,Sun Jul 19 03:38:42 2015 UTC,"In all honesty, unless it negatively affects his school work and life in general, stopping school to lose weight doesn't sound like the best plan. But that is just what I think, with no real reasoning behind my thought.  Try to reason with him to a middle ground. Ask him to try doing what he is doing now for a semester. It will be difficult, but surely he can find some way to make it work for a semester. At that point, if he is still insisting on taking time off school, take off a semester instead of a year. Hopefully, this time crunch will encourage him to work hard for those few months to lose those 25 pounds. This way, it doesn't set him back too much with school."

If he's always had a belly, then if he doesn't maintain the actions he's doing to lose the weight, he'll just put it back on when he goes back to school- if he goes back at all. What about when he has a full time job?   He needs to lose his belly, ok. He needs to grow some stones, man up and make the commitment to eat healthy, work out and balance class and work too.

Compromise is great....& as someone who has recently gotten into possibly the best shape of my life it's totally done wonders for my self-esteem & confidence. So I can see why someone would want to do this. Personally I feel that at the end of the day it's kind of his life. Yeah feel? & whether it's a good idea or not really depends on the type of person your boyfriend is...like if he was some dude that truly didn't have his life together anyway or had never had his life together, I'd be like hell nah this guy is going to work himself into a downward spiral but whatever. But if this dude is paying for his own place, going to college, and is managing having a boyfriend.. Then he probably has a good idea of what he can & can't handle. Who knows maybe if he doesn't do this he'll end up gaining double that weight and enter a downward spiral. Best you can do is be supportive. He's what 20? It's not like he'd be the first person to graduate a year later than he anticipated."
askgaybros,3dsqet,Hausblu,0,Sun Jul 19 05:27:46 2015 UTC,"Hmm that's an interesting take. We're actually older - he's 28. His degree is mostly (I think) to educate himself - he studies ancient poetry or something. He has a decent job ($23/hr), and he says that if he takes the year off he would work more instead and that he would use the tuition money to pay down debt or for us to take some trips - he doesn't find working stressful, and since school has been off for the summer he's been working full-time and lifting weights/eating fewer calories. I guess school makes him more exhausted than work (he also refuses to get less than an A on anything)."
askgaybros,3dsqet,Hausblu,2,Sun Jul 19 05:43:54 2015 UTC,"Ahhh... See this somehow comforts me as someone who has been trying to be more detail oriented. & it's truly all in the details.   Okay so if his education is to broaden his horizons & he is doing it on terms that don't dictate his future but his growth... Than it makes a ton of sense why he would want to do this ""lifestyle change"" this way. People grow differently .. & congrats to you for having an unconventional boyfriend.   Secondly as far as a finances... This approach makes sense too. I can't tell you the amount of times I've taken somebody else's advice on what I should be doing when they have no idea what my financial situation is. Like. Honestly finances are stressful & while just sticking to something for awhile might make a lot of sense to some people it doesn't for others. I'd say that what your boyfriend is more or less doing is giving himself some time to recharge & to enjoy life.. Maybe because he knows that his education isn't a priority.   I would say enjoy this & make the most of this time. I'm sure your boyfriend will come out of this next year as a better person. Everyone's journey is different & like cavafy says in the poem Ithaca ya got to take some time to smell all the perfumes & enjoy the ride. & sometimes we really just have to be okay with being in the moment.

askgaybros,3dsqet,jaycatt7,0,Sun Jul 19 06:05:11 2015 UTC,"I think he could do that, but chances are he'd gain the weight back when he went back to school. Old stresses, old habits, etc.   Better strategy: Learn to love the body he has, and learn to make incremental changes he can integrate into his routine on a permanent basis. A great big all-out blitz is easier, but it doesn't leave lasting results.  Also: I'm thinking either he has some serious issues with how he feels about his body, or he really needs a break from school for some other reason. If that's the case, maybe he really does need time off to regroup."

You're going to meet some of the most radical weirdos you'll ever meet in your life on campus, and that ragtag band will likely include a huge number of LGBT people, as well as allies. You may even meet some people who are way too militant/progressive for your tastes, and that's okay. Even conservative campuses in the reddest of states have LGBT groups and events at which you can make friends. But yeah, you're likely to be safer and meet more open-minded people at state schools or larger private colleges.

All factors are worth considering, however, I think you'll be happiest if you choose to go to a school that will fit your academic and extracurricular (or whatever it is you hope to get out of college) needs first, before you worry about anything else. After you've compiled a list that's based solely on what I've just described, then focus on the demographics and everything else to help you narrow down your choice. In short, I would highly advise AGAINST choosing a school mainly because it boasts a higher level of LGB (or non-White) students because at the end of the day, your education is (I'm assuming) what matters most to you, not necessarily the other people there (although, they're important too). I guarantee you'll find a place that will suit you; there are so many schools in this country. Good luck!"

Large cities/universities are a way to go,  Though I wanna point out that small college towns might be very cool as well. Like ok, I live two hours from Groningen (NL), which is very small, but since the university is so huge, like 60% of the population are students; so it's a very cool place for lgbt kids.   On the other hand, you could study in let's say Chicago, but like in a very conservative part, and therefore be in a less supportive environment.

Option 2 - move into shared accommodation that you can afford. There's a risk of getting a bad roommate, but really, that should still be a world of relief over living with a while family of homophobes.

Based on your past posts looking for a boyfriend (and thinking you're some hot catch- unattractive, no life skills and serious entitlement issues coupled with what seems to be crippling dependency problems), you haven't learned a thing.   Even if you had a boyfriend, you couldn't just up and move in with them. You have two options- stay with your parents and enjoy sucking at their teat like you have your whole life, or move out and get acquainted with the real world. Where people pay rent to live somewhere, and then save money to buy a house, and pay groceries and other bills, cook food for themselves, clean up after themselves and do their laundry. All at the same time, while they work full time. Some people even do all that AND go to school.  You're too old to have your head this far up your ass. You say you're gay and want a boyfriend. Gay guys are men who date men. Who would want to date you? You're not a man. You're a child. Real men don't date children. Children live at home and expect to be cooked for and cleaned up after. Children refuse to take responsibility for their lives. Children fritter away the time pretending the world owes them something and not facing the reality presented to them.

Nobody is benefited by the truth here. Come up with a convincing story for your family and warn them about this person (I'd suggest something like a scorn person with a crush un-returned). Once your story is airtight and they know this story and are ready call his bluff next time he tries to contact you.
askgaybros,3dropu,Kovoti,11,Sun Jul 19 01:50:24 2015 UTC,"/u/MakeHimGag  I'm tagging you in this because I feel I have quite a bit of insight to offer considering I went through a very similar situation VERY recently.   Quick backstory: I'm 21, he was 23. I'm out to friends in college, but closeted to the family at home. He is out to family, but closeted to friends/coworkers/public. So essentially we are opposites of each other in that way.   On April 23rd I broke up wit him after dating since December. Things were just not working out, and I told him that I think we needed to end things, discussions were grim that afternoon as you can imagine.  He was always a heavy drinker, and his friends knew how to throw a party so I expected there to be plenty of alcohol in his system that night. In preparation for that I just turned off my phone when I went to bed at 11. I needed to sleep because I had an exam the next day, etc. I woke up the next morning, and turned my phone on to see several texts saying I'm going to out you to your family. He used the exact same methodology that your unfortunate acquaintance did. He said he would tell my Mom, Dad, Brother, and my dad's current girlfriend via facebook. Initially I wrote it all off as drunk speak. However I was a bit concerned, so I texted him and said ""I'm sorry you had a rough night, but I've got an exam can we meet up after to get your stuff back to you."" He responded with ""Whatever you fucking faggot, I'm telling your parents."" At that point I realized last nights drunk speak was so much more than that. I remember the flip my stomach did as if it were yesterday. I go into a panic mode, and it's the most afraid I had ever been in my life. I very much understand what you're afraid of.   First, I text messaged my parents and said ""I love and miss you guys. I need to have a conversation with y'all when I get back home, just ask me about it later."" My dad responded with ""Well that's not remotely concerning"", his girlfriend said ""we miss you too, and can't wait to see you in a few weeks"", and my mom said ""I'm praying for you my (name)"". As you can see they're very loving, but I still wasn't ready to tell them because I always wanted to come out when I had a long term boyfriend. I wanted to come out and show them that I am happy, and I wanted to show them that I'm not alone. My in texting them was I need to have this conversation face to face, but if they were to hear something from an outside source I could own up to it and explain everything. Essentially a ""Yes it's true, and that's what my text was about. I wasn't ready to tell you, but XYZ occurred to force my hand.""  The next thing I did was I messaged the fuck-wit that threatened me. This is where you and I have fewer similarities. I knew a lot about this man, he was my boyfriend of 4-5 months. I tore him a new asshole via text message and told him - If he wants to out my to my family I can't stop him but he would have to live the rest of his life with the fallout of it all. I knew he had a conscience and that would take care of the rest. It took a lot of breathing exercises and looking at those motivational pictures about ""it takes 20 seconds of insane courage."" I ended up missing that exam, but I later talked with the Dean of Students about it; she then worked with me to convince the professor to allow my final to replace that 0 test grade. He didn't out me, but when I got home two weeks later I told my family.  Flashforward to today: The advice I have to give you is that IF you are forced to speak to your parents approach it with only 1 criteria for ""success."" My criteria was that I wanted to hear both of them and my step mom say ""I love you"" still/no matter what/despite everything. All I needed to know was that they loved me. Beyond that we can work as a family to get to a better, stronger place. Everyone ended up saying that, and mom and dad made those the first words they said.  My mom still has conflicts, she is a very religious woman and she fears that I will end up in hell. I know that is her greatest fear. I've simply told her this is who I am, and have been for as long as I can remember. She has not mentioned ""praying the gay away"" or anything ridiculous. She just said repeatedly that I was created by god and that he has a plan for me. Despite everything she has still loved me and she supports me. This summer I've made a couple trips back to college to hangout with friends and she always asks ""are you going to see that monster who tried to out you?"" The answer is always no because I've blocked him on every form of social media, but she would kill this guy - I have no doubt about that.  My dad is struggling the most. I'm his oldest son, and he was born in 1951. He literally said ""back in my day if people felt this way they suppressed it. I told him I wouldn't just choose this route it's by far more difficult than being straight.  I even told him in high school I would try to suppress it, but it threw me into deep depression. I even said ""I know I have seemed noticeably happier since going to college, why did you think that was?"" It took a while for him to come around, but about a month and a half later we are fine, and everything has returned to normal.  My brother and my dad's girlfriend were very understanding and they basically said we are here for you, but please be patient with mom & dad because it'll take them some time. I always intended on being patient with them so that wasn't anything surprising.   Overall, I'd say his intentions blew up in his face. Every one of my friends came to my defense and railed his ass, he has few friends remaining in the entire town. Meanwhile I gained friends, respect, and the love of my family. I faced the situation head on, and today I'm in a better place because of it. I'm not saying it's going to be sunshine and daises. There were some really hard and really miserable times, but you have to work through it as a family. The one thing I hate seeing in coming out stories is cutting people off. If that is at all avoidable I think it's worth the work. I'm not saying you should take any abuse (physical or verbal), and I'm also not saying you should downplay or lie about anything to appease your family. I'm just saying if they don't immediately bake a rainbow cake don't throw a bitch fit because I've heard of stupidity like that before. Honestly, looking back. The hardest part about coming out was all the people who I heard saying ""fuck religious bigots"" or ""screw anyone who still holds that backwards thinking from the 60s."" That was hard because they're telling me to just tell my mom to fuck off, the woman who has cared for me for 21 years, and they're saying my dad's mentality is backwards. That's not a fair evaluation of the situation, and as strange as it sounds I really felt horrible for my parents because they would see/hear this name calling on facebook and I know it hurt them to think I agreed with all these titles.   TLDR; I'm rambling, but if you need any advice from someone who went through a very similar situation don't hesitate to message me."

askgaybros,3dropu,signal-zero,1 point,Sun Jul 19 09:27:33 2015 UTC,"I felt very much the same way. My mother was extremely religious, my dad is about as right wing as they come. I am their oldest son, and often looked upon as the most successful. I too know the pressures of continuing the family. Like you said though, they're good people. Never in my life have I questioned the love that my parents had for me, and because of that I knew I would be okay to tell them. Keep me posted if you end up saying something. I wish you the best of luck."
askgaybros,3dropu,Zoomjet3,8,Sun Jul 19 09:42:05 2015 UTC,Block him. Stop Talking to him. Report him to Facebook. Try and block him on your parents' accounts.
askgaybros,3dropu,pensivegargoyle,5,Sat Jul 18 22:05:05 2015 UTC,"Unless he has evidence of you and your boyfriend being together, then provide none. However it seems like you may have in begging him not to. Your bf does need to understand that coming out to family, especially when there's still reliance on them, isn't all roses.  Your best bet here is to block his ex, so that if he screencaps the message you sent him as ""proof"" it'll appear blacked out (instead of a blue active link). If you can't, then respond with ignorance to what he says. Respond with ignorance if he tells your parents, or even do something reprehensible and play to their homophobia. Tell them he's some gay guy that came on to you and that you just weren't interested, but he continued to push things."

askgaybros,3dqr7a,indomante,6,Sat Jul 18 22:10:23 2015 UTC,"No dudes are putting their poop fingers on me, because a finger in my ass does nothing sexual for me. I wouldn't even want to do it to someone else."

What I've learned so far is that once someone touches you in that way, there will always be a small part of them in you. Especially if you remain close friends. For a long time, I was deeply in love with a guy who didn't find me appealing in the same romantic/sexual ways. We talked constantly, and he eventually became my closest friend. We are still inseparable and I know I mean a lot to him as a close friend. It will always be a teensy bit sad that we didn't end up together, but I remind myself that the majority of relationships end eventually anyway, but truly good friends are hard to find. It's better to be someone's beloved best friend than try to date and break up a few months later.  Plus, the longer you know this guy, the more you might see how you two just wouldn't have worked as a couple. He might have habits or opinions that you overlooked when you were infatuated, and when you see them as his friend, you can say ""Wow, we would've broken up over that!"" I'm not saying you should look for reasons to tell yourself that, but the longer you know him, the more you'll see of that.  Don't think about forgetting him or throwing your feelings to the wind. A part of him will always be with you. Just process your feelings and his input, and see where that takes you. You might become friends, or you might just part ways. Either way, your feelings for him will eventually simmer down to where they should be. Try to be decent/mature about it. Don't become one of those guys who refers to his former crushes negatively.

askgaybros,3du9l7,broaway999,1 point,Sun Jul 19 15:52:24 2015 UTC,excuse me? 77% + 17% + 13% = 107%
askgaybros,3du9l7,pisio,5,Mon Jul 20 00:03:03 2015 UTC,Yeah they add up to more than 100% because people can check multiple races on the census form
askgaybros,3du9l7,broaway999,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:15:50 2015 UTC,Hispanic is a weird demographic.
askgaybros,3du9l7,signal-zero,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:54:21 2015 UTC,"Yep. In fact here in Europe it's not considered a race, alike to Jewish."

askgaybros,3du9l7,indomante,0,Sun Jul 19 16:34:16 2015 UTC,"Considering the four ""major races"" in the US (white, hispanic, black, asian) and adjusting for population sizes, it's gotta be white-hispanic, or maybe asian-hispanic.    Taking dating / hookup profiles as a proxy, there's a ton of ""no blacks"" from everybody (including blacks) and a lot of ""no asians"" from whites."

askgaybros,3drf3g,youarejustanasshole,1 point,Sat Jul 18 22:40:20 2015 UTC,Was there a particular reason on why he waited 'til in his late twenties?
askgaybros,3drf3g,helpful_person,5,Sun Jul 19 01:15:57 2015 UTC,"Probably same as most guys who lose it at that age. Brought up religious and felt nothing but shame about themselves until finally free of parental influence.  Source: Me. But not late 20s, mid."
askgaybros,3drf3g,jodyjoseph,4,Sun Jul 19 01:45:38 2015 UTC,"Yep. Pretty much this, except with personal shame rather than shame caused by parents. Dating was also not a priority for him, and because of this he spent much of his 20's working on himself instead. Consequently he has tremendous character and is a wonderful boyfriend.   I'm a lucky guy."
askgaybros,3drf3g,vexillifer,5,Sun Jul 19 03:35:26 2015 UTC,"Mmm, it's surprising to see some of the comments as no with their own reasons. I can see why is complicated at times because I (Virgin before he took me) am experiencing certain difficulties with holding a relationship.   If everyone was more open, I guess the majority of the answer would be yes. Virgin or not, it wouldn't really matter. I find people who say no are a bit selfish because they only want a relationship that only benefits themselves. We were all born as virgins and learn along the way. Saying no is like saying, only I can have what I want in this relationship, you have no say, you need to shut up. This relationship is toxic and doesn't define what love really is. If you were to be more understanding it would all work out fine. We all started from the bottom.   Yet again I would have to be more understanding, so I guess people who answer as no must be because they've been through a lot in their past relationships and they don't want the next one to be ruined.   My boyfriend has been through many relationships, but this one is my first. I am starting to notice my attachment (or should I say commitment) to him to be stronger than his to me. I also notice that he is not very understanding that we all make mistakes and we all learn from experiences. Some fast some slow. I feel that I was expected to do a lot of things that brought to his disappointment because I didn't know I was supposed to do them."
askgaybros,3drf3g,avs72,4,Sat Jul 18 22:27:49 2015 UTC,"To say that someone is selfish because they don't want to date a virgin is ridiculous.   It's not like the only people for a virgin to date are experienced men ready to settle down long term who are selfish for not taking a (most likely younger) virgin on as their partner.  Most people go through a period of experimentation or medium-term dating during their teens and early 20s where the expectation of marriage is very small, but people build up experience, confidence, and sexual skills and it's an important period of their lives.   I have already been through that phase and I like my sex extremely non-virginal. To have a virgin join the scene likely either means that I'm bored or they're overwhelmed and that is just something I'm not interested in dealing with. And it certainly does not make me selfish."
askgaybros,3drf3g,GaybitusaK,6,Sat Jul 18 23:56:04 2015 UTC,"My husband would probably object. But if I was not already married or in a relationship, then yes, I would date a virgin."
askgaybros,3drf3g,rainbowgeoff,4,Sat Jul 18 22:36:38 2015 UTC,Simply just yes.
askgaybros,3drf3g,vexillifer,8,Sat Jul 18 20:24:52 2015 UTC,"I don't date anyone in the first place that I don't plan to hopefully be with long term. So no, a virgin wouldn't bother me. It would be awkward if it turned out we weren't compatible and I wanted to break up with him. I doubt the line of ""it's not you but me"" would go over to well."
askgaybros,3drf3g,rainbowgeoff,1 point,Sat Jul 18 19:24:11 2015 UTC,"While you're perfectly entitled to date who and how you want to, I don't think it's inappropriate to break up with someone, especially a virgin, if the issue is sexual compatibility. You don't have to hurt their feelings or shame their performance (if that's even the hypothetical issue), but sexual satisfaction and compatibility are very important aspects of a relationship and if you're not getting what you need it's not shameful to part ways because of that."
askgaybros,3drf3g,__Miguel_,3,Sat Jul 18 23:50:28 2015 UTC,"I didn't mean sexually, I meant personally. I get that sex is a big thing for some people. My sex drive isn't that high so for me it's not that big a deal. I just like to cuddle and watch a movie to be honest. Yet I've known guys who had to cum at least once a day."
askgaybros,3drf3g,somekook,5,Sun Jul 19 00:56:29 2015 UTC,"If I didn't have a boyfriend already, yes :P  By the way, I was the virgin one with my first three boyfriends. All of them were thoughtful and waited for me to be ready for it. I lost some part of my virginity with each of them, and finally had anal at the age of 26.  So, yes, I would date a virgin."
askgaybros,3drf3g,indigolalafell,2,Sat Jul 18 19:51:08 2015 UTC,"No, I would not."

askgaybros,3drf3g,millionoillim,2,Sat Jul 18 22:22:11 2015 UTC,"It depends what you mean by ""virgin."" I'm in my late twenties and have had more than double my age in sex partners. Yet there's one sex act I've never managed to do very much of. I haven't considered myself a virgin since high school, but I am technically a virgin in that one area. I'm open to changing that someday, but I'm in no rush. I do sometimes worry if a guy will be turned off by the fact that I've never been fucked, but really, at this point in my life, I've got a lot going for me. There's more to me than my butt and what has or hasn't been inside it, and a good guy will see it that way too."
askgaybros,3drf3g,NickkkLG,4,Sun Jul 19 01:31:02 2015 UTC,No. Mainly because it means that they probably haven't had a relationship.
askgaybros,3drf3g,Bearberlycrusher,1 point,Sat Jul 18 22:19:36 2015 UTC,"Well, being one of those virgins up until 4 months before I turned 23 (I lost it in December 2014), I can say that I will always remember the guy who I lost my virginity to, but it is not in such a way that I think most people associate it with. Its just a name and a face, nothing more than that. I had actually been turned down for dates by a couple people after they learned that I was still a virgin because they mostly said that they 'didn't want to ruin it for me'.   Speaking as the virgin to the guys who do not want to date a virgin, I tell you to just DO IT if you are interested in them."
askgaybros,3drf3g,John2Nhoj,1 point,Sat Jul 18 23:26:30 2015 UTC,"I only find myself emotionally fulfilled in power exchange (kinky) relationships, so I can't see myself dating a virgin: you need some experience under your belt to enter into a kinky relationship.  That said, if I really liked the guy otherwise and he had a predisposition to kink, I definitely could do some ""let's be friends and I'll help you explore yourself and see if we're compatible to start dating."""
askgaybros,3drf3g,BestViktorEUW,-1,Sun Jul 19 05:34:51 2015 UTC,"No, most likely not.  Besides the attachment thing that happens pretty commonly;   I don't have the patience to be anyone's sex tutor, but prefer guys who pretty much already know what they're doing, so we can just get to it."

askgaybros,3dt8kx,Chris770,2,Sun Jul 19 11:53:19 2015 UTC,"Oh absolutely, I'm extremely happy in our relationship. Yes, there are a great many benefits to poly relationships, especially poly households, over traditional relationships. Even in just a very basic financial sense, most of our living expenses are split three ways, while we have three incomes rather than two. However, the reason why this works for us is because we're people who're well suited to it. There's also a great deal more than sex involved.  Jealousy can easily become an issue, but there are ways of dealing with it. Not every method works for every poly relationship, however. In our case, he and I are not only very good friends, but have developed a level of mutual respect which would be considered extreme by any other standards, and that solves a lot of problems. He and I also understand very well that the sheer amount of romantic and emotional attention that she needs to both give and receive (she's a very large hearted person) would overwhelm either of us by ourselves, so it's a partnership between us that keeps her happy and allows us to live with her, and at the same time neither of us wants for any sort of attention at all."

Talk to them ONLY VERY BRIEFLY, then say that you're going to get a drink (or something like that). Tell them that you hope they have a great time at the event. And then excuse yourself with a smile.  Remember to smile throughout this interaction.... And do your best to really mean the nice things that you are saying.

askgaybros,3dr9nl,NickkkLG,3,Sat Jul 18 21:42:04 2015 UTC,"I think putting on a show of class is probably going to be your best bet.  To tell a somewhat slightly similar anecdote: I was living with my bf when we broke up, and we kept living in the same apartment for about six more months. After a few months he started hanging out with a guy (not dating officially) and it was clear they were interested in each other. They hung out at our place as well as at other places.  I was kind of hurt by it, but like you I realized that I don't control his life and I needed to move on. However I didn't handle it in the best way. I basically just chose to ignore them when they were around, and in doing so I came across as unfriendly and cold. Fortunately after a while I figured it out and realized that the best thing I could do was to act friendly and supportive. Even if I wasn't super happy about it, I wasn't going to make anything better by being an ice queen. Once I started being nicer things got a little more pleasant for everyone, and I was even able to talk to the new bf (I'm honestly not sure that they're even official to this day, but this all only happened a few months ago) a bit and he's a good guy, although I don't think he's very smart. Still, that's beside the point. The point is put on a friendly face and act happy even if you're not. It will make everything much more pleasant."

If you are true to yourself and are walking your own path, your relatives who truly love you will eventually see this and will be happy for you.

There will always be people, including some relatives, who will never accept you. They will try to twist and break you to fit into what they want you to be, even if it turns you into a miserable and tortured person. These people don't truly love you or care about you, so don't waste your time with them.  Come to America, Canada, or Europe. Make your own family.

It's perfectly possible that they will not support you being gay out of love if they truly believe you are going to hell.

It would be a good bet to test the waters with females and you might be bisexual and never allowed yourself to discover that. Telling your parents or anyone in your family that you are gay will only make them perceive you as this sick person with a sinful fetish, so it's better not. I myself have thought about immigration too and it's very doable in my case, but I'm largely heteroromantic and I really want to have a relationship with a woman and have kids, so I can hold the men attraction  at least. As for the repeated question, two of my uncles , 29 and 37, clearly stated that they don't want to marry and don't want to have kids. A woman could be pressured to marry, but when a man says no, they usually follow it. Whatever you choose, measure the pros and cons and what matters really to you."

askgaybros,3dq0bj,chaquarius,1 point,Sat Jul 18 15:11:41 2015 UTC,"First off, I never told him to convince his parents to accept him as gay while living in Saudi Arabia.  I pushed him to get out of his country first, to take care of himself first and just merely pointed out that even ignorance can be remedied through education. Once he's out of Saudi Arabia and settled in another safe country, he can worry about ""coming out"". Most people agree with this advice.  I know exactly what I am talking about. I know about the dangers of being gay in the Middle East. I know what it takes to survive and the first step is getting out and changing the environment you're in. YOU don't know my background or what I've been through yet you're commanding me to not give any input.   I'm not even telling OP to hate his family. There's a reason for homophobia and the reason is ignorance - doesn't mean his family are bad people.  Secondly, telling someone ""they cannot talk"" and silencing them just because they haven't lived in someone else's shoes is almost encouraging ignorance.   I might not come from the Middle East, and neither are most people here, but that doesn't mean you can just tell people to shut up and not give their input and advice and shutting them out of a conversation is not progressive at all. Telling people to stay quiet will cost OP his life if he cannot get outside perspective and know that he can be in a safer place.  I honestly don't think you should be telling people what to do. You going around telling people to stay quiet doesn't contribute anything.  There's a difference between showing compassion and being a realist - I'm being a realist in the advice I am giving., which is to get out of his country."

Not a lot of risk, but that's par for the course with 99% of the population, men and women, engaging in oral sex. Understand that the only completely risk-free sexual activity is abstinence.  Try not to have so many one night stands if you cannot accept the risks without considerable anxiety. You can always have them use protection when you do give, but understand that while most people will be okay with condoms during anal sex, they might not be interested at all if it's just oral.  Otherwise for bacterial infections there's no real preventative way. Just when you get your STI panels tell them to do a throat swab too. You'll be outing yourself, but there are laws ensuring your privacy. Plus would you rather have your health care provider know you're also into guys, or unknowingly having an STI in your throat?"

[pdf]    Sixty-eight percent [95% confidence interval (CI) 58–78) of HIV transmissions were from main sex partners because of a higher number of sex acts with main partners, more frequent receptive roles in anal sex with main partners, and lower condom use during anal sex with main partners. By sex type, 69% (95% CI 59–79) of infections were from receptive anal intercourse, 28% (95% CI 19–38) were from insertive anal intercourse, and 2% (95% CI 0–5) were from oral sex.  [...] Conclusion: According to our model, most HIV transmissions among MSM in five US cities are from main sex partners.    Xiridou, Maria, et al. ""The contribution of steady and casual partnerships to the incidence of HIV infection among homosexual men in Amsterdam."" AIDS 17.7 (2003): 1029-1038 [pdf]    Results: Currently, 86% (range 74–90%) of new HIV infections occur within steady partnerships. A reduction of 75–99% in infectivity caused by HAART will be counterbalanced by increases of 50% (range 30–80%) in risky behaviour with steady partners, but not by increases of up to 100% with casual partners. If HIV testing is increased from 42 to 80% and HAART administration from 70 to 85%, then even an increase of 100% in risk-taking with steady partners will not outweigh the effect of HAART. Conclusion: Most new HIV infections among homosexual men in Amsterdam occur within steady relationships."

askgaybros,3dr8g4,bemynightlight,11,Sat Jul 18 18:04:58 2015 UTC,"Homosexuality as we know it today is very different from how ancient civilizations practice it (something some Christians fail to consider when condemning today's notion of homosexuality). People love to say ""well, the Greeks and Romans were accepting of gays!"" yet that is just not the case. The only ""accepted"" form of homosexuality was not consenual. Men of equal statuses would be condemned for sleeping with each other, but a man could sleep with a male slave or another lower status (as long as the older man of a higher status was not the bottom although intercrural sex seems to be the preferred method of male-on-male sexual activity) with very few social and cultural repercussions. These relationships usually involved coercion, rape, and a large age disparity. Some men of very high rank could get away with engaging in homosexual romantic partnerships (like an emperor), but they weren't openly accepted and embraced."
askgaybros,3dr8g4,indigolalafell,4,Sat Jul 18 20:15:19 2015 UTC,"As you describe it, the Greeks and Romans had little problem with homosexuality itself.

askgaybros,3dr8g4,avs72,3,Sat Jul 18 22:49:10 2015 UTC,"That's one interpretation. It's important to note that Augustus, in an effort to increase the slowing birth rate of the elite, enacted laws that would punish women and families who would not bare children as well as punish activities that he thought would damage the family unit like adultery (which held different definitions for men and women). I don't know if there were laws against homosexuality before Christian reform, but I would assume homosexuality was partially looked down upon because it could lower the birth rate of elites.

For the most part the Greeks and the Romans viewed sex as a recreation type activity, especially the Romans. They had sex with men for pleasure and women for children. It was deeply frowned upon to be the bottom.  Another interesting fact is that all of the Roman emperors except Claudius were bisexual. One of the reasons Nero was frowned upon was because he was rumored to be the bottom partner. This was mainly because of his acting, to my knowledge. Men often played female roles.

That said, The Black Eagle recently has been booking some good music - house, techno, etc that is different from most of the other bars/clubs in the gay village.

And I just answer honestly: ""Deal with it.""  As fluffhoof said, getting tested doesn't change the results, it just makes you aware of them.  I would rather know if I had something so I can avoid passing it on and if I have it already, there's nothing I can do to change that.  My thinking is that there is no point in stressing over something you have zero control over."

I broke down crying with relief after HIV- results with both.  One consequence of that is that I've spent enough time thinking of myself as essentially poz at this point that it doesn't scare me like it used to.  I used to go years and dozens of partners and risky scenarios without getting tested.  Now I get tested every 3 to 6 months.  I will or I won't be poz after the next test, hopefully not but either way life goes on."
askgaybros,3dp9m8,dropbrian,4,Sat Jul 18 05:58:17 2015 UTC,"I don't know where you are, and so I don't know what kind of healthcare is available to you, but seeing as you're on Reddit, writing good English, I'm assuming you're in a developed country (most likely the US, Canada, UK, or Australia). If you live in a developed country, you'll have access to healthcare. Even in the US with their backward system, access is very good.   If it comes back negative, then obviously you're fine. But you've evidently had a bit of a stressful time, and maybe you won't do whatever it was that you did to make you worry again (pro tip- don't go and bareback all the skanky men at the worst gay bar in town).  If it's positive, then you're not exactly in a bad situation in 2015, in a developed country. Here in the UK, current life expectancy following an HIV diagnosis is to live for a further 40 years. And that's assuming no progress in HIV treatment, and of course that's not the case. I do not expect an HIV diagnosis in 2015 to have an affect on life expectancy for 99% of those diagnosed, assuming they look after themselves and take their tablets.   HIV is now, for most patients, a chronic condition, like diabetes or asthma. To be honest, from a purely medical point of view, I would prefer an HIV diagnosis to a diabetes diagnosis- statistically, as an otherwise healthy 24-year-old, I would live longer, and with less impact on my life, if I had HIV than if I had diabetes (either type).   If you are worried, and it is a perfectly reasonable thing to be worried about, speak to your doctor. He or she will be able to help, and will have training on how to counsel you about things, and can provide support."
askgaybros,3dp9m8,guitarsdontdance,4,Sat Jul 18 10:03:10 2015 UTC,"New research suggests that the sooner an infected person begins treatment, the easier the infection is to keep under control; less potentially toxic medicine is needed to keep the person healthy, especially over a lifetime. This makes sense when you realize that HIV is a retrovirus that literally writes itself into your DNA; if you have been infected within the last 48 hours, a month of massive anti-virals just might stall the infection and ""cure"" it, conversely the longer an infected person goes without being treated, the more the virus has a chance to work its way through the body.  So like, getting it caught in the first few months is almost like being negative and on PreP; getting it caught later is always worse. So if you test every six months, you are making sure if anything bad has happened, you have the MOST control over it."
askgaybros,3dp9m8,Firecrotch2014,3,Sat Jul 18 13:09:40 2015 UTC,"Just dealt with this issue myself . I was terrified , I convinced myself I was positive and being a huge hypochondriac did not help .  It came to a point where the anxiety and stress consumed my every day thought , I didn't realize how much control it had over my life , until after I got tested .  Educate yourself . Go to a reputable clinic that offers knowledge on risk factors and prevention or dealing with being positive.  Whatever the outcome , you are either shortening your life and possibly damaging others lives by being positive , or are actually negative and causing yourself a lot of stress by putting off the test .  Figure out who your support people are that you can rely on and trust , and go get tested - you owe it to yourself ."
askgaybros,3dp9m8,TristanTzara1918,2,Sat Jul 18 04:35:26 2015 UTC,"Taking precautions beforehand will ensure more than likely that you wont be surprised when you are tested.  Like using condoms every time you have sex especially if you are promiscuous/having sex with multiple partners.  Practicing monogamy/abstinence instead of fucking everything that moves.  If you dodge the bullet this time you might want to take more precautions.   I know this'll be downvoted to oblivion but goodness forbid someone should tell you to keep it in your pants so you dont catch some life altering/shortening disease. GL to you.  Hope things turn out in your favor.   edit: I cant believe how so many gay men are just so non-chalant about the possibility of having HIV/AIDS. Like seriously. Its like saying, ""oh well if I get cancer I get cancer, its no big deal.""   It still changes your life.  Granted its not the death sentence it was in the 80's but its still a big fucking deal.  You have to take meds EVERY day and you cant miss a dose or the medicine can become ineffective. Plus you need to inform everyone who you will have sex with or have had sex with in the past of your status.  Its like some gay men have written off themselves to eventually get it.  I guess they will if they engage in high risk behavior."
askgaybros,3dp9m8,indomante,1 point,Sat Jul 18 10:43:55 2015 UTC,"Deal with it by finding an anonymous HIV clinic. They'll treat you confidentially and it won't necessarily be known by everyone. There is a form that you MUST sign for it to be anonymous. Depending on the staff they could just ""out"" you then everyone with access to your medical record will know. It's still reported to the state but not to all HIE systems"
askgaybros,3dp9m8,Thirdatarian,2,Sat Jul 18 03:53:46 2015 UTC,"Depends where, man.  Here, you just walk in, give a (possibly) fake first name.  They take you to a private room with a test kit, ask some epidemiological questions and make sure you're psychologically ready to receive an HIV+ result, then administer the rapid test.    No possibility of it not being anonymous since they never even known your name."
askgaybros,3dp9m8,Beef_muffin,1 point,Sat Jul 18 06:01:17 2015 UTC,"It helps knowing that it's not a death sentence. It's relatively easy to live with HIV/AIDS now, compared to years ago. Know that by getting tested you are protecting yourself and all your future partners. All getting tested will do is give you peace of mind until your next test if you're negative or put you on the path to treatment if you're positive, which again, ISN'T THAT BAD. Obviously don't try to become positive, but it's not like your world will come crashing down around you.   It's not like playing Russian Roulette at all, because in RR the fact that eventually the bullet will fire is an inevitability. Every pull of the trigger increases the odds of a bullet going off, from 1/6, 1/5, and onward until it's guaranteed to fire the next time you pull the trigger. When you're getting tested, you're not increasing the odds that your next test will come back positive. There's no chamber of tests that once you run out the next one will come back positive.  I know it's daunting, but keep in mind that you're doing this for your own good. It's no different than going to the dentist and being told you have a cavity. You get treatment, you're more careful in the future, and you live your life."
askgaybros,3dp9m8,Quaversalis,1 point,Sat Jul 18 06:33:46 2015 UTC,Honestly...  I just don't!   If I had to deal with the possibility of being positive everytime I went then I probably wouldn't go.   I go to the clinic every 3 months.  It's in my calender.  I go because it's time to go and it's a routine.  I never give it more thought that  that.
askgaybros,3dp9m8,j23ny,1 point,Sat Jul 18 10:11:12 2015 UTC,"I might also recommend going to the clinic with someone who you trust. Regardless of the result, I think it would be a good idea to have someone close to you to be there for support.  And I agree with the other posts about getting tested sooner rather than later.

As for your ""just a barista""-type comments, I would ask you these questions in return:  Are you worthy of happiness?  Are you worthy of love? The answer to both these questions is ""OF COURSE YOU ARE!""    Go for it!"

askgaybros,3dnbps,sj000000,8,Sat Jul 18 15:13:38 2015 UTC,"You have answers from shy people, which are basically saying go for it. I'm just going to chip in as someone with no social anxiety, and no shyness. If anything I could do with a shot of bashfulness from time to time. My advice goes not just for dating / hook ups but for all social situations. When you meet people, you draw conclusions. Perhaps they're sexy. Perhaps they're funny. Perhaps they have some other magnetic quality. But, and here's the killer, you are only seeing 5%. The rest comes when you interact. Some people are cool af, but you interact with them for ten minutes and they are relentlessly obnoxious. Some people (maybe like you) come across as reserved or standoffish, and then some interaction proves that you have some cool opinions, or something in common. So I'm not saying go for it because he sounds interested, or interesting, but because it's only through interacting with people that you learn about them at all beyond that initial impression. Almost all conversations work to break down barriers and increase intimacy. There is absolutely nothing you can lose from giving this guy your number and a 'go for a drink on Friday?' message, save an evening of your time. You could gain almost anything that you can imagine. Perhaps a week from now you and him will be doing the dirty. Perhaps six months from now you and he will be on a Caribbean beach walking in the surf holding hands. Perhaps a year from now you'll be telling one of your friends what a psycho he was, and as hot as the sex was you're glad you dumped him. Our soulmates and our nemeses cross paths with us every day, and living life is finding out who they are.  PS I am drunk."
askgaybros,3dnbps,blue_surfboard,3,Fri Jul 17 22:40:40 2015 UTC,Ahahaha I actually just had two sangrias so I'm right there with you! But that was beautifully put!! Thank you.

askgaybros,3dnbps,blue_surfboard,2,Fri Jul 17 22:53:29 2015 UTC,"...and as confident as he seems he might be sitting at home looking at your number thinking ""eep, do I dare call?""!

askgaybros,3dnbps,anxiousbp2,2,Fri Jul 17 23:02:02 2015 UTC,"That was why I posted. If you and I were talking IRL I would have zero shyness, and I would come across as totally confident. This does not always translate into inner confidence and self-esteem! Everyone I know thinks that I'm emotionally and socially completely sorted and balanced because of my social skills, but deep inside I'm as fucked up as everyone else. Your guy is no different. Even if he's total alpha dude 99% of the time if you knew him long term you'd suddenly realise some deeply held anxiety he has, or weird hangup, or whatever. This is a good lesson that there is really no point in being shy. We're all the same. Fuck ups!"

I read in another comment how you're worried giving him your number or telling him to come by after work will sound. But this guy already took interest either way and probably likes your shyness.  So honestly, own up to your shyness, and just ask. Who cares if you stutter it out or he helps you finish the sentence, you might just be melting him away with that.  It really sounds like there is some interesting chemistry going on and you should definitely go for it, and most importantly post an update later :D Pls deliver OP.  As for the barista bit; don't beat yourself up because of some perceived notion that there are ""better jobs than a barista"". My dentist PhD boyfriend doesn't mind me being a graphic designer/artist that finances his projects by working in a bookstore.

Why don't you do this poor guy a big favor and show him that, if he's really lucky, he might be able to have YOU !!! Tell him that you'd like to see him after work to MAKE HIS DAY !!!

askgaybros,3dnbps,lastdinosauronearth,8,Sat Jul 18 03:56:39 2015 UTC,"If what you are saying is true, he definitely sounds interested.  You should just give him your number and see what he does.

I already get flustered with regular talking to him. Even imagining approaching him with my number gives me heart palpitations..so yeah"
askgaybros,3dnbps,Landredr,9,Fri Jul 17 18:00:06 2015 UTC,"He's the one who started with the chitchat and moving the conversation along.  I think that is more than enough to say that he is at least interested in talking (at length, repeatedly) to you.  He already knows what you look like, how you talk, and what your job is so don't worry about that.  Plus, he asked if you were dating anyone which to me is a HUGE sign he is flirting with you.  There are two ways this can go.  You can take active steps or you can let him take the next steps.  If you take the next step then yes, give him your number, invite him into the coffee shop for more interactions (""want to come by and we can do a coffee tasting?"" etc) so then you can learn more about him and have a deeper conversation.  Easy since he is already liking coffee, how you make his coffee, and you can have a chance to talk with him more.  Or, you can wait for him to make the next move which is likely to be continued friendliness towards you, seeing you regularly for coffee, etc.  But we have no way of knowing if he might take it a big step further and volunteer up his phone number/contact info.  Whatever he does next is his choice.  The risk is that if he doesn't pickup on your return signals he may think there is nothing there and not make further moves to progress your flirting further.  You, however, can prevent that from happening by taking the next step (coffee tasting/some excuse to see him for a longer conversation, or giving him your phone number).  Just remember, you can let this play out or you can take a more active role in moving it forward.  Either way, it's your choice to act or not act on the situation.  Also, you should definitely flirt back!  Give him your number!!!  Do it!  Don't be afraid!  He might say thanks and be polite, he might say no.  But nothing you described here even hints at all that he would be a dick about you approaching him.  The worst case scenario isn't that you make a move and he rejects you, it's that you do nothing and he stops flirting and you get sad because you let it go.  Make yourself and your desires be heard!  I don't know you but please, put yourself out there in the world!  There's someone out there who wants to know more about you, sounds like this guy is interested... in you!"

askgaybros,3ds55m,sdsorin,4,Sat Jul 18 23:25:11 2015 UTC,"It's probably a good thing your friend no longer works in insurance because that's horrible advice. If you had a claim it could be denied by misrepresenting yourself. Your ticket is going to cause your rate to be a bit higher for at least three years, and though it's a not at fault accident, it's still used for rating purposes.  It sucks but it will get better. The best thing to do is call and make sure your getting all the discounts you can... Paperless, anti lock break, antitheft system, etc. Or shop around, just make sure to include your ticket and accident in the quotes. Good luck!"
askgaybros,3ds55m,doody4,1 point,Sun Jul 19 00:34:49 2015 UTC,"This.  Have a wreck and say one wrong thing or inadvertently give them your actual address by accident and you may find your claim denied and your insurance cancelled for fraudulent misrepresentation.  Then you're on the hook for the whole thing.  If you haven't already, try shopping other insurance companies.  If either of your parents were in the military you should qualify for USAA membership and may get a better rate also."
askgaybros,3ds55m,jwax33,2,Sun Jul 19 04:16:52 2015 UTC,"Yeah, what others have said is true. Lying to the insurance company, about anything and for any reason, is insurance fraud. If you don't get in trouble for it, they will at the very least deny every penny of a claim under those conditions.   I also live in Florida, but my car is paid for, so I pay about a third what you pay. In this situation, you can either pay off your car and downgrade to cheaper insurance, or you can shop around for other rates. You could look into joining your father's policy and just paying him for your share. It may be cheaper than $140 a month to pool policies, at least until you pay off your car.  But never lie to the insurance man. Those people are much smarter than you might think, and they'll use any excuse they can to avoid paying on a claim. It's not worth the risk."

askgaybros,3dqg08,fluffhoof,3,Sun Jul 19 00:26:30 2015 UTC,"You could go about this a couple of ways. Take on attributes and ways of being that gentlemen do - holding doors, respecting others' time and words, actually hearing someone when you listen and not just be waiting to speak, etc. You can also pick up some stereotypical manly traits in things that you find an interest in - cars, bbq, sports, fixing things, making things, outdoors stuff, camping, etc. If you're concerned about your mannerisms or how you sound or look you can always change that with tweaks. I'm just not exactly sure what you're looking for.    My best advice is to find guys who you admire for manly traits and try to incorporate those aspects into who you are. If you desire to be something then seek it out in others and become it. Don't listen to people who say that you're pretending.    Do people say that people who want to lose weight, get fit, learn a subject or skill are pretending? No. They're noticing a goal and seeking it out. This is the same."

askgaybros,3dqg08,flux365,5,Sat Jul 18 14:16:34 2015 UTC,"Well, there are things that you can't voluntarily change (e.g. hairyness or height).  Body can be changed to an extent through diet and exercise (though what exactly do you want is on you (lean and ripped, thick muscles, powerlifter type, just fat, just a little bit more thick than you are now...), so check out the relevant subreddits (obligatory plug for /r/bodyweightfitness, it's the bees knees).  For looking manly, I'd guess look for male fashion blogs, and I think there's a subreddit for that as well.  Trying to force yourself to have more manly interests most likely won't make you happy. Confidnece can be seen as manly, so be confident in your interests."

askgaybros,3dqg08,anfkev,2,Sat Jul 18 17:18:39 2015 UTC,"Hi,  I don't know of this is useful or not...   Maybe part of this has to do with your age... If you are still very young, maybe this has to do with growing up (and older).  Also, to some extent manly is in the eye of the beholder.  And it is your own eyes that are really the most important.  Try to have good character so that you will embody what you believe a man should be.  This will allow you to radiate something great to the world because the best things inside of you will be perceived by others."

Everyone is unique, and there's no reason to be something you're not (unless you're an asshole, then yeah, change. haha). There's absolutely nothing wrong with who you are. You'll find someone who likes/loves you for YOU... not for who they think you should be. Be yourself!! Can't stress that enough. :)"
askgaybros,3dqg08,flux365,2,Sat Jul 18 16:20:19 2015 UTC,Eh. If someone doesn't like who they are no amount of 'just be you and someone will love you for who you are' will change that. We all change over time for different reasons. It's just that OP has acknowledged and pointed out what he likes along with a desire to change. What makes this so different than any other situation?

Again, if you don't want to be what you are you change that part of yourself until you become something else that you like. Life is about choices and choosing what you want out of life and who you want to be. Nothing is set in stone. We all come into this world as a blank slate. It's up to us to choose how we want to be represented.   It's only acting when someone is temporarily faking something to fit in. If someone is actively changing an aspect of themselves they're becoming accustomed to it so eventually it will be a part of them. Fun fact, if you're upset and you fake a smile long enough eventually you'll really be smiling and happy. I hope you truly see the difference between acting temporarily to fit in and please others, and striving to be something else long term until you can actually be that. There's a huge difference there."

askgaybros,3dqg08,anfkev,2,Sat Jul 18 18:44:03 2015 UTC,"What? That doesn't even make sense. I was at one point more feminine and now I'm more masculine. I set about to change traits in myself, how I spoke, and how I acted, and eventually all those things that I changed became a part of me. Your assessment isn't correct. I speak from personal experience. Unless you can point to a specific study that shows your hypothesis then it's just that, a hypothesis. There's absolutely no basis in what you have to say except for your personal belief. Making large assumptions that aren't based on facts is dangerous."

I just don't like it when people make blanket assumptions and give them out to people who are honestly asking for help. Other people can have a different opinion than me. By you saying something that is unfounded in any sort of fact is harmful to people that are looking to others for help.

askgaybros,3dqg08,shitsureishimasu,1 point,Sat Jul 18 13:27:36 2015 UTC,"Opinion moves back and forth on this. The modern view is that we have a self that is our core identity, and personal expression should be a reflection of that true self.  A more Victorian attitude is that we have traits in ourselves that we can cultivate over time. Even older traditions say that our true self is mutable and that by cultivating external behaviors in ourselves, those bits get internalized to the self.  The truth is probably some combination of these things.   I have aspects of my personal expression and my self that I consider ""manly"" which I chose as a young man to cultivate in myself. I chose these things because some men that I deeply admired demonstrated the traits. They include how to treat other men (being supportive, be slow to judge, don't be horrible) and my expectations of myself (always try to improve, reach out to new things).  The way I cultivated these things was simple. I surrounded myself with men that I admired and viewed as my betters. Like it or not, we pick up traits from the people around us, and our interactions with them reinforce various behaviors. Choose your friends and your surroundings carefully, as they will determine your future self.  As far as ""what's manly"", I will never slam beers with by broskies after a day of tossing the ball around. But I will go climb a mountain just 'cuz it's there."

There's not necessarily a set definition on how to be 'manly' so that's why he's asking. I always find that helping someone is a lot more productive than criticizing. :-)

It gets to a point where people completely deny themselves entirely just to avoid being assaulted or punished either civilly or socially.   On the other hand, while it's very optimistic to think that someone will be into what you're offering, often times experiences say the contrary. You stick to it, and then 15 years later, after having lived in 4 different countries and locations and trying your best to stay relaxed and focused on yourself while being open to possibilities you still haven't encountered anyone that who's interested in what you're offering.

Seriously, the only consistently male feature is body hair.  Focus on doing the things you want to do, being the person you want to be.

Manners are for pussies.  2 - Hide all of your emotions, both joy and fear.  Anger is okay, but only sometimes.  3 -Sit with your legs spread as wide as possible.  Take up as much space as possible.  4 - Talk about sex at every opportunity.  Especially about sex with women.  If you feel extra-gay, then you MUST talk about being the top and highlighting how the bottom squealed with delight (like a woman).  5 - Make lots and lots of money.  And spend it rashly on status symbols, especially phallic substitutes like sports cars, flashy electronics, and sports gear.  6 - Play sports.  Talk about sports all the time.  Make everything a sports metaphor.  Sports, sports, sports!  ESPN shall be your new favorite channel.  And for god's sake, go to the gym every day and gets lots of muscles.  Muscles make you a man.  7 - Grow lots of body hair.  Just not on your back.  And for god's sake, get a crewcut.  8 - Wear ugly clothes.  Preferably picked out by your mom (or some other dominating, castrating female).  9 - Practice bad hygiene.  Brush your teeth, but make sure you sweat a lot and smell a little.  If you use cologne, it must be Old Spice.  Or High Karate.  Nothing by that effete Calvin Klein.  10 - Make sure you have a deep, gravelly voice.  Smoking helps with that.  Especially big, manly cigars.  Nothing says ""I'm a dude"" like lung cancer.  11 - Drink lots and lots of booze.  Real men are raging alcoholics.  12 - Father as many children as possible.  That's a bit harder to do when gay, so start donating to sperm banks.  Your seed must be spread.  13 - Lastly, don't read anything!  Hell, just using reddit makes you suspect!

Also, next time you are able to contact him, come at it from a perspective of ""I'm worried about you, you seemed a bit unhinged the other day, are you getting brain flu?""

askgaybros,3dpcrx,jodyjoseph,1 point,Sat Jul 18 16:10:03 2015 UTC,"In your Title, you use the word ""delusional"" and it's possible that word is exactly right.    A delusion is a FALSE and FIXED belief.  FIXED means that no evidence will convince the person that they are mistaken.... And the delusional person really and truly believes the delusion is true.  Delusions are symptomatic of Psychosis... a true break away from reality. Usually the right medication can shut this down, at least temporarily. But the delusion cannot be reasoned away.  So a crucial part of understanding what was happening with your friend is... Did he really believe what he was saying (a delusion)....  Was he just saying these things because he was upset but he knew that these things were not true (a passing exaggeration)....Or..... Was he pure and simple lying for the sake of manipulating you (""Gaslighting"")....Your appropriate response depends on which of these was actually taking place.  If he really is delusional, then he must get help from a Psychiatrist who will put him on medication to help him. He may even need to be hospitalized for a while.  If it's one of the other 2 possibilities, the you can try to talk things out with him. And that really could be successful.  As a first step, I like the idea someone else gave you... Call his parents and just say... ""I've been trying to reach (name) but I haven't been able to do so... I'm kind of worried...Is he OK ?""  And figure out the next step based on their answer.  I think it's extremely unlikely that you led him on. And i dont think you are having blackouts of your memory of actually having slept with him.  So blaming yourself for what happened is uncalled for. Be nice to yourself.   I hope things improve soon :)"

askgaybros,3dq4xv,SchroedingersRogue,3,Sat Jul 18 15:46:52 2015 UTC,"I was raised in Vancouver and did an internship/exchange at U of T for a time so these are sort of my thoughts and experiences. I personally prefer Vancouver since I was raised there but I'll try to keep my reasoning objective.  Cost of living is pretty expensive in both cities with Vancouver probably more expensive but honestly you're gonna be paying a lot to live in a big city anyways. Vancouver, though, has much more natural beauty (mountains, forests and the Pacific Ocean) and the weather is arguably better as well since even though it rains a lot, the winters are never very cold and the summer never too hot.  Both places are incredibly open minded and diverse so you won't have to worry about that and schools are comparable as well, especially since you're going into undergrad so the differences are largely negligible. UBC campus is absolutely stunning, though, if that's your thing but a huge downside is that the campus is somewhat difficult to commute to and not very near the interesting parts of the city. In comparison, U of T is right in the heart of downtown so it's very convenient and easy to find a place to go and have fun at the end of the day.   In terms of transit, Vancouver is just better. If you're a university student in Vancouver you get a U-Pass which is included in your tuition fees and basically lets you on any bus and train for free to any zone. I believe Toronto has something similar for their university students but it's a far better deal in Vancouver than Toronto. Also, even though Toronto has more train lines and stations, because of the way the city is laid out, it actually doesn't take you to as many places in my personal opinion. Richmond, Burnaby, Surrey, which are different cities are in metro vancouver, are all relatively easy to reach by the subway. In comparison, I felt the only place outside downtown Toronto that was easy to get to was Markham and even then that only takes you to the edge.   That being said, though, the Toronto nightlife blows Vancouver right out of the water. Clubs in Vancouver are generally more expensive and just really not worth it to go. The gay community I felt is also a lot more active in Toronto, so even though both places are incredibly accepting of LGBTQ, you do feel a greater sense of community in Toronto. And there's always an event going on so you'll never feel bored.  Also, I don't know whether this would be relevant, but Vancouver's Asian population is absolutely MASSIVE so if you're into ""Asian"" stuff (karaoke, bubble tea, pho, the famous Richmond Night Market) then seriously just go to Vancouver, don't even consider Toronto. Toronto has those stuff too but Vancouver does it much much better.  TL;DR Vancouver and Toronto are both pretty great and it depends on what your priorities are. If you want to have lots of fun and be able to go out every night, Toronto is your city. If you love the outdoors and enjoy chilling with friends at the beach or going hiking, Vancouver's for you."
askgaybros,3dq4xv,OttawaAndrew,2,Sat Jul 18 15:14:31 2015 UTC,"I'd say Vancouver, but Montreal is worth a look as well. Honestly, if money were not a concern, check out all the big cities and see which you feel most connected to."
askgaybros,3dq4xv,omgindigo,1 point,Sat Jul 18 12:13:49 2015 UTC,"The already small gay community here is also white oriented. It's hard to get dates/hookup if you aren't a tall white jock(I'm a jock,just not tall or white,Latino/Asian guy here)   I can't speak for Vancouver, although I visit often, but I'm always bewildered when I hear this. Of course tall and muscular guys get the most attention, but I see Asian and Latino guys getting tons of attention where I live (Seattle). So for you to be a mix is almost a bonus. If anything, I'd say Asian guys are the most selective, mainly in pursuit for the proverbial tall, muscular white guy. They seem to ignore or disregard the rest, which seems to be why they end up disappointed.  Anyways, if you're looking for a bigger, more diverse scene - can't go wrong with Vancouver or Toronto."
askgaybros,3dq4xv,pensivegargoyle,1 point,Sat Jul 18 15:20:25 2015 UTC,"Both cities have high costs, Vancouver even more so than Toronto. Unemployment is a bit higher in Toronto. The problem of declining gay nightlife since the introduction of internet dating is universal and so it's affected both cities. In addition, gay venues have been lost to housing development. So while in either case there's still more options than in Calgary, don't expect to be going to different gay bars all the time. You'll find the one or two choices that suit you and that will be that. I think that the difficulty dating while Asian thing is likely to follow you, unfortunately. I've heard complaints about that in Toronto and I don't know if it would be different in Vancouver.  About schooling, it's really the same situation in both places. There's one university that has a higher reputation than the others, and is therefore harder to get into, but the others are good choices too. There's nowhere that I'd say you shouldn't go for academic reasons. Just consider the programs you are interested in carefully to see that they match your interests and lead somewhere."

I always talked about going away for university because they started to take the hints - I wasn't happy or hopeful for the future and I think it was killing me. The other day they told me they would support my decision to attend a school in Vancouver such as UBC, despite how expensive it is, because they truly came to think it was best for me.

I live north of Seattle and know a lot of Canadians (most from Vancouver, some from Calgary and Edmonton) who live here as the area is very similar to Vancouver, but much less expensive.  Like BC and Alberta, Kokanee is the ""beer from here"" as well. Many places fly the Canadian flag and we do get CBC on cable (channel 2 or 99) and via antenna.    While not a big city, Bellingham, WA has Western Washington University (a very nice school), is very gay friendly, and is only 25 miles from the border so weekends are often spent in BC. Housing costs are significantly cheaper than Vancouver and clothing and food is often 20-40% cheaper.  If anything, the $50 cost for a NEXUS card is a very smart purchase as it significantly reduces border wait times.  I'm partial to Vancouver myself, though Toronto seems like a nice place based on all of the HGTV shows.  BC definitely has natural beauty, hence the ""Welcome to the Best Place on Earth"" marketing.

askgaybros,3dojd5,John2Nhoj,3,Fri Jul 17 23:58:35 2015 UTC,"I'm going to offer an idea of why you are doing this stuff.  Your description of being overly giving implies that you think that you CAN ONLY be accepted and loved by doing excessive efforts to make yourself good enough... by giving in an unlimited way.  But what you describe is that even that excessive giving does not convince you that you are really good enough to be loved.  This is probably a repetition of how one or both of your parents treated you... never good enough no matter what you did.  But here are some things to consider... 1) Your boyfriend IS in fact with you. So that implies that he thinks that you are good enough for him to love.  2) By worrying so much and giving excessively, you are preventing yourself from gaining the reassurance that love can give you... That you are good enough to love JUST BY BEING YOU.   So you are preventing yourself from receiving the exact kind of reassurance that you need so badly. That you deserve to be loved just for being you  3) You need to test that... by stopping yourself from worrying as much as possible AND by stopping the excessive giving... and then...SEE WHAT HAPPENS !!!  Imagine how it would blow your mind if you stopped all of this worrying and frantic giving... AND HE STILL LOVES YOU !!!!  That's what you need so badly. Let yourself have that."

In my mind, none of those are legitimate reasons not to bottom for you. His whole basis for denying you is that you don't fit his preconceived expectations of what a top should look like. He's basically saying ""you look like a bottom, so you must be a bottom."" The only person who gets to decide whether you're a top or a bottom is you.  Obviously you can't force him to do anything that he doesn't want to do, but he's open to bottoming in general and doesn't seem to have any emotional hang-ups over it. Its just that, in his mind, he's got a little box labelled ""Bottom"" checked off next to your name. You need to let him know that, in your mind, that little box is labelled ""Vers"" and that fulfilling that desire to top every once in a while is important to you.  If I were you, I would have a conversation with him to let him know how important it is for you to top, or at least try to top a couple times just to see how it goes.   If he refuses to even give you a single opportunity to top, I would have to say that you're sexually incompatible."

When you're in a relationship you should want to please your man.   Someone here said that nobody needs a reason to decline getting fucked in the ass. I entirely disagree. I'm not talking about strangers or first dates, but if you want to build a relationship with someone don't you want to be the guy who takes care of all their needs?

I would call myself top/vers, mostly because it is easier for me to top and to be in the mood to top. However, I'll go through periods of time when I just want to be the bottom and to be damn good at it. Other times I could go months without a desire to bottom, or just want to have some toy play on my own. He could just be in a top only phase. However, if you want the experience of topping him, then he should be willing to try, or give a better reason than ""No, you're the bottom."" Good luck!"

askgaybros,3dn9lw,Vikkio92,1 point,Sat Jul 18 09:35:09 2015 UTC,"I disagree with most comments down here. Nobody can say whether it's about 'masculinity' or his 'preconceptions' about what a top should look like. Admittedly, this can easily be true, given society and the way people have been raised up until now, but it's not necessarily true. The 'preconception' might easily just be that he is not into that with you. I am mostly top and can only bottom when I am extremely aroused. This requires the top to be bigger than me. Is it because I have a preconception about how a top should look like, or how 'masculine' they should be? No, I think anyone can be a great top. I can easily bottom for an extremely camp top, the complete opposite of what's commonly referred to as masculine. Simply, the idea of being fucked up the ass by someone smaller than me does not arouse me, which makes it basically impossible for me to perform as a bottom. It might easily be about his preference, not about some preconception.  This obviously doesn't mean it would be ok for you to be in a relationship with someone who doesn't want to bottom on a whim, or to force him to bottom when he doesn't want to, but I wanted to make it clear that there is not just one single explanation for his behaviour. Therefore, my advice would be to talk about it with him again and try to really understand where he's coming from."

It's really hot to me to have someone else decide when or if I get to play with my dick. There is a slight amount of humiliation going on as well (I.e. having to sit to pee, etc). Having someone exhert that much control over your daily life is kinda intimate. Nobody else knows what's going on, but your sitting behind the desk in your office, dick being held by some unforgiving cage, wondering when or if you'll get to cum again. It's a pretty big mindfuck actually."

That is a lot of fun to experience. :)"
askgaybros,3dno95,korobatsu,9,Mon Jul 20 14:49:23 2015 UTC,It comes from small dick/sissy culture.   Does it? I've never thought about it that way before. For me it’s more “You can’t touch that because I said you can’t and I'm in control” than “Haha look at you and your tiny dick.”

askgaybros,3dnnsa,superawkgaythrowaway,10,Fri Jul 17 19:15:38 2015 UTC,"The most recent study put the average at 5.2"" x 4.65"" so 7"" is way above average.  I measure 5.2"" (when I am REALLY hard) x 4.25"".  I'm great with the length.  I wish the girth were bigger.  Nonetheless ever since I was 4 I have heard nothing but negativity about guys with my dimensions and it's only RECENTLY where I've been online and I've heard that my dimensions are fine with some folks, but too late as I've internalized all the messages.  It didn't help that even though I get a lot of attention from men I consider hot, it's not unusual that I feel men only want me for my ass and that has felt very emasculating.  It's led to erectile dysfunction and massive anxiety when I am in bed with someone.  I think it's easy to say to someone stop torturing yourself and get over it when 1--there's literally NO SAFE PLACE for guys who feel insecure to unburden their emotions around this issue 2--there is only positive language about large penises, not small ones 3--a lot of sites that are supposed to be about small penises are filled with ""small penis humiliation"" which is not fun for people who are just not into that (like me) 4--I have only had TWO partners compliment me on my penis (although I've gotten lots of lovely compliments online from people) and the rest tend to say something like ""you make up for it in other ways"" which implies that they find my penis lacking.  I go to therapy.  I use a couple of 12 step programs to deal with intimacy issues. I have a strong spiritual practice.  I work out like a mofo and have a great body. I'm on Lexapro for my anxiety. But it feels like the solution is missing.    It's a little difficult to be the smaller and shorter partner 99% of the time and I know that's part of the internalized hierarchy I get that ""bigger/taller is better"" for men.  I try not to discriminate around penis size and I'm fine with a wide variety of sizes from small to large, but I find larger ones take a lot of emotional and mental work for me to feel safe around.  The urge to compare and despair is there.  I guess at the end of the day I want to be seen as a man and treated as a man and my penis is (although smallish/avg) a big part of my sexuality and a major source of sexual pleasure for me.  It's very hard to ask for what I need and not feel like someone will laugh in my face.  I had one partner tell me he would never bottom for me because he only bottoms for men taller and bigger than him.  I had another partner tell me that the smaller guy should always be the bottom.  It's very hard to just shrug those messages off.  Many of us are doing the best we can and struggling with just letting our sexy selves feel free but we have had a lot of demons implanted in us that are hard to exorcise.  I try not to get too neurotic or talk about it much with partners for fear of turning them off, but then I am left feeling that I have to solve this entirely on my own and that's a very lonely place to be.  Lastly, if anyone is struggling with this and needs someone to talk to, I am available.  I need someone to talk to as well.  We smaller guys should be supporting and inspiring each other."

I wish they would though, they'd be a very brave person. A small one should be no different to how we view eyecolour really....small penis hate needs to.end.now. There's so much more to man than one small bit(no pun). We need a cultral overhaul on this topic imo.  But this big dick obsession i think its a power thing to an extent. I mean certainly it seems like there's this paradigm in the gay world/hookup casual sex scene of: small cock=bottom Big=top. Small=submissive Big=Dominant. At the sametime though i think its more complex than that. I mean in general terms the western world is alot more judgmental, disdainful, ostracizing, nasty, harsh, hostile & shallow when it comes to a small penis than it ever is to a big penis. It can be tough & downright brutal if you don't match up. Afterall we live in society that covets, idealolizes big cocks. Its so highly emphsized at the expense of everything else, coveted n put up on a pedistal as the best thing since sliced bread mindset thats so widespread these days. Bigger is better is mantra of our times, big dick=alpha, big dick=masculinity, its tied up in notions of being the winner, a superior real man come sex god, a big dick means one has an intrinsic value. Society validates the well hung. It opens more doors(no pun). A big one is seen as an item of lust n envy, something to be praised n proud of(despite the owner doing nothing to earn it). These are all messages we're bombarded with since adolescence, it feeds into the large cock obsession imo.  On top of all that they're isn't any negative stigma, brutal emasculating/shaming,, mockery or real negative conatation attached to a big dick/its owner like there is with a small dick for instance, your sense of masculinity & what it means to be a male will never be questioned either. Again our society validates big dick guys. Nobodies ever gonna commit suicide cuz their dick is big, like increaingly more & more small/average guys do. Its not about the dick per se, its just a penis. Its about all the things a big dick is associated with. About the things it grants you acess too.  You see as a small dicked young(20, 4.5x4.1) gay guy top i've seen for myself how small penis is seen as a bad thing in todays world, its an item of mockery to be held in contempt & dirision. And thus by extension its owner is too. When your small your not shielded from the the putrid underbelly of western culture, the backwardness, the nastyness, brutal emasculation & hostility that pervades, people seemingly see a small one as fair game in a way they wouldn't for any other genetic trait we have no control over. A small penis is not an item of lust or envy like a big one either, its viewed as a joke, its owner a looser joke, not taken seriously, small penis=bad guy etc. As a small guy your viewed as a contemptible freak-show and not a human/sexual being with feelings etc.  Society views you as lesser. Your shut out & ostracized from the hook up scene(relaationships too. I mean i've seen on dating sites, to most guys who are seeking a relationship, a big dick is just another item to be checked off of their laundry list, like ""not a serial killer"", ""doesn't live with mum"" and ""has a job.""). There is not much love & acceptance out there for a small penis. Either from porn(whether its pro or amateur there is no representation of small dick guys outside of creepy SPH stuff, its always big/above average everywhere, small dicks are hardly ever shown in a good light & just see how many everyday ppl list small ones as a turn off/dealbreaker) to everyday atittudes/media/pop culture with all the jokes & shaming which makes it socially acceptable.. Its an existance of rejection, vengful rageful anger, lonliness & bitterness, silent suffering, despression, insecurity too. Your suffering/grievences often dismissed & not taken seriously like a womens would be. Its not right or fair. I fucking hate 21st century western culture at the mo. Its off in the head. Makes me sick! :(. There's something seriously wrong & unhealthy with our culture on this issue imo. Makes me so angry. It also makes you realise just how retarded & backwards Western culture is on this issue. We're nowhere near as advanced or as enlightened as we like to think that we are.  Ppl need to wake up. If they don't small guys need our need to have our own hook up app or something as i sadly can't see things changing anytime soon."

Internalized homophobia, maybe the fear of having a dick not masc enough.  Also just look at women and what they are doing with their breasts ""to feel secure"". In my country this is even partially covered by health insurance.

You have to stop torturing yourself.    On your last point: FYI getting rejected for being to small or too big on the surface seems the same...but its really not. See getting rejected for being too big is still an ego boost as your too big for him to take, sure im sure you feel down cuz you didn't get the guy n he rejected you...BUT there's no shaming or embarrassment, your not made an outcast. He's not gonna laugh at you or talk about you negatively with his friends. Your masculinity & worth as a human being won't be called into question either. it doesn't go deeper on an emotional level. Plus due to your size you'll be able to rebound quickly and get action striaght after again as they're maaaaaaaaaaany gay men who'll be more than happy to give you a go & actively seek you out. Small guys don't have that luxury. Its an entirely different paradigm to being rejected due to being small.

In a double-blind, repeated-measures study comparing three types of enema solutions (soapsuds, tap water, and polyethylene glycol-electrolyte solution --PEG-ES) in 24 healthy volunteers, rectal biopsies showed surface epithelium loss after soapsuds and tap water enemas, but not for PEG-ES enemas.

askgaybros,3dmkg3,WeegieBoarder,15,Fri Jul 17 17:57:29 2015 UTC,"Ways to meet guys.  Through networking: Having a group of gay friends might lead to you meeting someone via connections, parties, events you go to from meeting those gay friends and hanging out with them. Sometimes one of those gay friends can develop into something more.  Gay organizations (volunteer groups, special interest groups (soccer, singing, theater), etc): I recommend this as you get to do enriching stuff while meeting gays in general.  Clubs: Yeah mainly sex but who knows. Sometimes hookup lead to something more, sometimes some people in the clubs might not be into hook up only.  OKCupid/Grindr: Similar to club but much less direct.  Getting dates.  Via networking/organizations you do this by trying to be friends with people you connect with, sometimes if you feel something more can come from it sex/dating maybe pursue it and try.  Via OKCupid/grindr/club, you talk, establish sanity and common interest, go on a date/sex.   What to do on date.  Be your best behavior self essentially. We all have faults try not to let them show as much yet, get a feel for the person. Establish greater rapport.  To sex or not to sex.  Opinions on this vary some people wait an arbitrary number of dates before sexing. Some do it in the first date or if it feels right (sometimes you can steer conversation to this end or steer away). I think it doesn't matter much if someone would dismiss you cause you felt like having sex in the first date, I wouldn't want to be with such a person, so I say do it when it feels right .  FB or FWB to relationships?!  Be open to the possibility if you want but don't expect it. Expecting it leads to hurt feelings. Thus its better to seek guys who say they want to date/get bf.  Revealing the dark side.  The thing about dating and being with someone is it pushes you to be better for that person's sake as well as your own. Don't purposely reveal it as they'll learn for themselves as they get to know you. Of course this all depends on how severe and negative a quality we are talking about.   Misc.  Don't run into every possible gay guy thinking ""I'm gonna consider dating this guy"", just think of it as meeting someone cool and establishing how you two fit as people, and maybe that fit can be bf and maybe it can be friends or it can be hookups.   Don't expect a relationship to fix major issues, probably best to fix them yourself as best as possible.  Don't be with someone just cause it'd be nice to have a bf, be with them because it feels right."
askgaybros,3dmkg3,jpofreddit,9,Fri Jul 17 16:28:50 2015 UTC,"don't put too much stock in a stranger. I feel like a lot of guys start talking with a guy online and immediately start thinking about weddings and kids and spending their life with this person they haven't even met yet and still barely know.  go into the situation knowing that the vast majority of your first dates aren't going to go anywhere. and that's fine, just think of them as chances to practice your social skills.  definitely don't overthink what do actually do on the date. keep it simple and grab coffee or a drink after work; situations where you can easily make an exit if there's no chemistry between the two of you. all of my best dates were made so by the guy I was with, not by whatever activities we happened to be doing."
askgaybros,3dmkg3,loki8481,4,Fri Jul 17 20:55:39 2015 UTC,"Some things I find helpful while dating:  Always start with drinks or coffee on the first date.  Save the cool adventurous activities for the second date and beyond. You want a low stakes way to meet so you can peace out if there's no click or you really aren't feeling the guy.  Tinder, OkCupid, and Hinge are the best for more date-oriented people, in my opinion.  You run into less people who are just looking for a quick hookup.  Ask questions and tell stories, but don't overdo it. It should be a dialogue, and not just you talking incessantly or interrogating the poor guy.  Don't talk about negative qualities or past relationships until a few dates in.  If you start talking about exes on the first date, I'm going to peace because I don't want to be talked about to strangers as well.  If a date goes well, text him within 24 hours and plan a second date.  Don't wait too long.  I can easily get booked over a week in advance, so if you want to see me again soon, don't wait until the last minute to plan it.  If it doesn't go well, don't text them saying ""I don't see this working out, but good luck!"" or anything like that UNLESS they text you asking to hang out again.  It's a little insulting.  However, if they want to hang again and you don't, be honest and gentle about it.  Don't just not respond!  I recommend saving sex until a few dates in and starting with naked making out/touching/cuddling at first.  The build up to the sex is nice but you still get a ""release.""  I go on a ton of dates (had 4 this week) so happy to offer advice. Although I have a hard time making past a few months, but that just might be my pickiness problem. I usually lose interest in guys after meeting once."
askgaybros,3dmkg3,charawaybok,6,Fri Jul 17 17:57:56 2015 UTC,"Well, if you are up to it, asking for people's number is a good start. Took me a while to get the courage to do that, and I'm not bad looking, either. Personally, I'm not a fan of the texting each other phase, so I try to ask them out for coffee or drinks within a day or three. Some people will think that's too fast, but if they say that then I give them a call on the phone (why is this considered old fashioned?). As far as dating apps, I like okcupid. Grindr and the like are for sex 90% of the time, which is fine, but you might have trouble finding a bf that way.  As for the date itself, try and learn what you can about him. You're fact-finding at this point. But also, you can talk about inane stuff too. It really just your chance to get a feel for what they're about. And to have fun.  I wouldn't go into a date expecting to have sex or expecting not to. It's got to come organically from how you feel about each other. Personally, I would be just fine having sex on the first date, but I'm also a little shy about talking about it. So it usually takes a few dates in my experience.  I've never had a hookup ever turn to fwb. To be honest hookups don't make me feel good anyway. To each his own, though.  I just had a third date tonight. Still no sex but it was a good night. We made out in the car afterwards but he is an early riser and it was 1am already so we called it a night. I'm really excited about this guy and I think he is boyfriend material. To be honest I've never made it work longer than a month or two but we'll see.  I've been dating a lot these past few months (3 guys, not concurrently). You really have to be ruthless with your rejections and in turn be an adult when you are rejected. I've had both situations and it's always tough but just man up when it happens. If you don't like the guy, don't waste his time by not telling him. You can phrase it like ""I don't think we should date anymore."" A neutral phrase like that is ideal in my opinion, and makes it harder for the conversation to turn into ""what makes you not like me?"" Which is a question you should never answer except with someone you've been with for a long time. It can be hard being a heart breaker but if I'm gonna find the one, there's going to be a trail of potentials between me and him."

And so many guys are afraid to make the first move, you'd be surprised how many would probably say yes (or at least that's been my impression).  Also on dating apps, once some chemistry has been established, set up a coffee date ASAP.  Within the next week.  One hour.  Make plans after so you have somewhere to go.  All you need to do is determine if you want to go on another date after.  Take it one date at a time."

My go to is ""I don't feel that sort of chemistry [for dating] with you but I'd still like to be friends, if you don't want to I understand"". Omit everything after you if you don't want to be friends (and add sorry). I like saying that because it essentially says the ""spark"" of romance didn't happen for you and its no ones fault (also its partially true), it also shows that you understand that it might make him mad and you're cognizant of that fact and sympathetic.  His response can be him blowing up in which case ignore him, him ignoring you to let you go in which case let him, or he might surprise you and be understanding enough to know that's how life is sometimes and you can be friends if you want. The few times I rejected someone none of them blew up on me so that seems to be unlikely, most of the time I just get ignored and I assume they decide to move on, occasionally some are understanding enough and express interest in just being friends."

But mostly I'm happy that fewer kids are hurting and killing themselves and feeling isolated and alone.
askgaybros,3dkv42,Heroworship1973,15,Fri Jul 17 03:02:06 2015 UTC,"I used to -- but now I don't. The main reason is that although society is more accepting, the gay scene and how gay guys treat each other is much worse.  It's catty, cliquey, mean, totally ignorant of the importance of building friendships and building people up.  It did not used to be anywhere near this bad.  I think that although the newest generation has the appearance of confidence, they really don't, because they don't have the life experience that builds confidence.  There was more depth and sincerity when we were ""all in this together"" before it was so easy to come out.  We all had to be more reflective and more caring and concerned for each other, because we knew how alone it felt to not have acceptance and friendship."
askgaybros,3dkv42,GoBigBlue2013,6,Fri Jul 17 05:57:49 2015 UTC,"It's catty, cliquey, mean, totally ignorant of the importance of building friendships and building people up. It did not used to be anywhere near this bad.   It has always been that bad.  It has always been catty, cliquey, mean....etc.  At least as long as I have been around, anyway.  You can find negativity anywhere.    Search out positivity.   It depends on who you associate with."
askgaybros,3dkv42,rcadestaint,3,Fri Jul 17 09:17:52 2015 UTC,"Maybe the reality about the gay community is coming into view, more, because the internet makes it more transparent."
askgaybros,3dkv42,GoBigBlue2013,3,Fri Jul 17 13:53:47 2015 UTC,"Good point, but I think positive-minded, open-minded guys were easier to find, when the internet was still fresh and new.  From about 1995 through about 2008 I always had a close, trustworthy gay friend, someone I just talked up online and hit it off with, and we stayed friends forever. (Cute guys too, by the way.  I'm still friends with Mark, Jeremy, Jesse, Tim, we don't talk every day anymore, everyone moved far, but the friendships are still solid.)  Sometime after that, people started getting into a really exclusionary, narcissistic pattern.  What gets me is two things: One, the guys I'm reaching out to in an attempt to start a conversation: they appear to genuinely have some positive qualities. They don't need to put up defenses and work so hard to maintain a mask.  If they took those masks and walls down, they would find they have a lot of genuine qualities that would make them attractive.  They would also find that there are people willing to help and support them and be friends back.  The second thing that gets me is: People don't generally act like this toward their roommates, toward their family members, toward their colleagues at work, toward their teachers or bosses, or toward the customers they serve at their job or when volunteering.  What is it about the gay coffee houses, bars, clubs, apps, websites that suddenly brings out this negative side to SO many people?  In the last two cities I lived in, its like 90% of the guys were infected by this scourge of acting like an ass toward others.  What gives?  And what will it take to change it back to something that simulates ""normal?""   Maybe I was extremely lucky and was graced with meeting the right people in the right place at the right time for over 12 years, but it seems to me something changed in the last 5-7 years that made things much, much worse.  For the first time in my life I understand why so many young gay people go into deep depression, go into addictions, or even think of taking very tragic actions in their lives."
askgaybros,3dkv42,GoBigBlue2013,2,Fri Jul 17 17:54:01 2015 UTC,"Haha - it is very unbalanced, very polarized.  I feel very similarly.  It is like being an outsider looking in, all the time."
askgaybros,3dkv42,GoBigBlue2013,12,Fri Jul 17 16:26:10 2015 UTC,Nope...  It was FUN to be part of a secret minority. It was like being part of a secret club.   Plus the experience of coming out at a time of relative risk helped me mature - forced me to overcome fear.
askgaybros,3dkv42,stranger_here_myself,17,Fri Jul 17 17:45:02 2015 UTC,"Jealous?  I am not sure of that is the right word.  I certainly don't have any feelings of  resentment towards the younger generations.   Envious might be a better word choice for me.    Don't get me wrong, no gay person has it easy.  There is the figuring it out in your own head.  The teasing by schoolmates if you can't fly under the radar. The coming out process.  The still inevitable bigotry by some of one's peers and based on where you live, life isn't easy even now days.   What I am envious of is the internet. I had NO ONE to talk to when I was trying to figure all this out. There might have been another school mate you thought might have been gay, but neither one of you even brought it up, let alone considered consulting each other on it.  ""Fag"" was another thing you said about people you didn't like. Homophobia. like racism, was rampant and accepted. To be branded ""Queer"" where I grew up was something no one let happen to them. They just got out as soon as they fucking could and never looked back.   And there was the problem.  As a kid in a rural school, there was no one and nothing. There were no older gay dudes anywhere around.  They left as soon as they could leave. You thought there might be another gay kid or two in your grade.  Or the grade above you or below you.  But you'd never say anything to them for fear you'd be branded a ""faggot"", and you sure as shit wouldn't want to be subjected to that. I got bullied enough as it was for being small and ginger.   So there you are.  All alone.  There is no one to talk to. There are not even depictions of people who feel and think like you do on TV or in the movies.  (Ocassionally you'd see people like Paul Lynde and people like that on TV and you suspected they were gay, but it wasn't the kind of gay person you were.)    The isolation was brutal. That was the worst part. You were the only one you knew who felt the same way you did. You had NO ONE to talk about it with.  And you had NO ability to research the topic.    You grow up thinking you are a freak. An oddity of nature. No one around you felt the way you did.    I start to think I am figuring it all out, at least in my head. And then the AIDS crisis hits.  This was when I was in High School.  ""If you are gay, you are going to die."" That was everywhere. That poor Ryan White kid was all over the news.   FUCK!!! If you touch a dick, you die. God does hate me, I guess.   And then it hit me.    There are a lot of people like me out there. They aren't here. They sure the hell aren't near me. They are somewhere else.  And some of them are dying.  But at least I am no the only one. I am not as big of a freak as I thought I was.  But wait!  They are dying!   I moved to a big city and volunteered in an AIDS shelter for several years.   The internet is a wonderful and fantastic thing.  It came to late for me as a kid and young adult. It wasn't easy figuring all that out all by myself.  And after you throw the AIDS crisis in, it was a scary time.   I don't feel jealous, though.  I love how life has progressed. How the concept of love has progressed.   And I love how technology has progressed."
askgaybros,3dkv42,rcadestaint,3,Fri Jul 17 05:08:22 2015 UTC,"Amen brother, you hit the nail on the head.  I came to terms with my sexuality right as the Internet was taking off in the late 90s and if it wasn't for the Internet, I wouldn't have come out of the closet. Someone should do a sociological study to map the gay rights movement to the birth of the Internet, I think we all collectively discovered we weren't alone, weren't defective, and could find each other with a few mouse clicks as opposed to moving to big cities and cruising gay bars."

I'm very happy I got to experience the hardships and friction of being an outsider, it has shaped me into the person I am today. Robert Jordan put words to this when the (super-lame, dull and boring) protagonist Rand Al'Thor thinks something along the lines ""a sword is grateful for the forge fire, because it made it into what it is, but it will never be fond of it"".

I think the biggest thing for me is that kids can now see themselves reflected in popular culture in a way I never could.  Characters in TV shows, celebrities, YouTubers, sportsmen, in music, etc, etc.  And of course regular gay guys in real life are so much more visible now too. Real people from all walks of life who could actually be looked up to and identified with.  Not just the effeminate but not explicitly gay character in a sitcom, or the 'bachelors' who lived down the street but whose relationship was never mentioned.  That's not to dismiss the work of the ""we're here, we're queer, get over it"" generations of loud and flamboyant gays that came before.  Hugely important, but not representative of the spectrum of gay men that truly exists.  With them, we wouldn't be where we are now; a place where someone's sexuality can be mentioned in passing and it barely raise an eyebrow."

While I don't love going out anymore I do miss meeting new guys in real time and not online.  I think there's something missing from the app experience that I am sad younger guys may not get to have.  I realize I speak from a place of privilege living in NYC and a gay person living in a not so gay place would find the apps a godsend, but I do miss socializing in public spaces and try to do so when I can.  I also am glad equality happened when I was older.  I so did not need to be getting married in my 20s and I know I would have if that had been allowed.  I didn't need to be going through a divorce back then.

askgaybros,3dpl1k,darknessvisible,1 point,Sat Jul 18 06:28:11 2015 UTC,"On what possible grounds could having sex be bad?  Well, it could lead to mental or physical harm.  I've never seen a convincing argument that mental health or happiness are affected solely by being a slut.  Sure, if you have hangups about that then it could hurt you.  Sure, people in your life might judge you negatively for that.  But those are not intrinsic consequences, they're situational and don't apply to everyone.  So physically speaking.  Sex always involves some risk of disease transfer, but it's manageable, even reducible to nearly zero if you're cautious and sensible.  So there's no such thing as ""too much sex"" or ""too many partners"", there is only sex which is risky, whether emotionally or physically.  Not all sex is risky, so you can have a crazy amount of sex with a crazy number of partners and still be very much ""good"".  I've had several hundred partners starting from when I was 14, been going for 20 years now.  That's a lot, but it's also done me little harm in the long run.  For gay guys, I'd say more than about 6 partners per year since sexual maturity is leaning to the ""a lot"" side.  With periods of abstinence or long-term monogamous relationships, that number can be pretty close to 0.  The rate of new partners falls as you get older."

For more general porn tumblrs (which are boring in my opinion) they are usually segregated by race because of the perception that having different races in the mix are usually used as a separate fetish category. This can be true of any race even white. The possible reason behind this is that if you live in a country where there is a extremely large majority race you are more likely to treat another race that is not common to your country as a fetish than something that is just another aspect of the already present porn categories. That or it's just a mild form sexual attraction based racism either way its more of a ""what can you do?"" situation."

That's why a lot of mainstream porn features conventionally attractive, muscular, young white men with above average penises.

With broader shoulders, neck, pecs, and arm development you'll carry the belly better.  Only obligate twink-eaters will kick a guy like this out of their bed, even though he's got a belly."

askgaybros,3dkbti,dunnowhaaattodo,5,Thu Jul 16 23:31:46 2015 UTC,Fellow gay Asian here.  I can say that i understand your family situation.  I think most of our Asian parents would do the same thing when their sons come out of the closet  to them.  I can't really give you any advice but i do hope you find the strength to do whatever you think you need to do to get out of this situation.  I'm also here if you need an ear to listen to your problems.
askgaybros,3dkbti,foeran,6,Fri Jul 17 02:27:04 2015 UTC,"I have a couple of things I want to point out. Maybe give you a suggestion or two to make yourself feel better and more accepting to your situation.      Firstly, I want to let you know that everything will be ok. You will be ok. This might not mean much, coming from a complete stranger, but despite how bad it seems to be, it will always get better.      Secondly, I want to point out, that there is nothing you have done wrong, nor is there anything wrong with you. You are living your life, not your parents', and thus must make choices and sacrifices that eventually end up making you happy. I realize this is far easier said than done, but what's important is that you try. Give it your best.      Thirdly, it's important to achknowledge that your situation is a very difficult one. You are financially dependent on your parents, and will most likely be for several years to come, but they won't support you as a gay man. As such, you are now forced to maintain the ""status quo"", so to speak. To lie, in order for them to support you. Understandably, this is something you don't feel right doing. However, you should know that many, many people, in your situation, would have done just like you. And that it's ok.      If I might say so, what's important is that you finish your education, so that you can become financially independent. Once there, you will have the full reins to controll your own life. If that means not sharing every bit of your life with your parents for a while, then so be it.      Oh, and I wish you the very best. You deserve someone wonderfull. You really, really do.      If you need to talk, PM me. I'd be happy to talk."
askgaybros,3dkbti,SomeWhat92,1 point,Fri Jul 17 01:24:01 2015 UTC,"I also suggest you work towards  learning to accept your own situation better, adopt a sort of just ""go with it"" mentality. It makes life much less stressfull. And easier to live.     You could for instance:     1: Make a habit of telling yourself everything will be ok, every day. In the mirror while trying to look cute/handsome/awesome. It works.   Or     2: Ask yourself whether there's really anything you can do to improve your situation, at all. If not, why fuzz about it and let it bother you? Accept it, move on for now. Resolve issue when you actually can!     Always remember, there will be a day, when you're free to do what you want most :)"
askgaybros,3dkbti,SomeWhat92,1 point,Fri Jul 17 01:25:02 2015 UTC,"Hello, I feel very sorry that you are going through this.  I agree with the other comments. But I have a few more things to say...  In the United States, students can get loans from the government  to pay for their education.  When they are earning money later, they pay back the loan.  Is there something like that where you live ? Because that would allow you to be much more independent now.  The other thing I want to say is very important. You should not feel at all guilty about lying to your parents. They are giving you no other choice. They are demanding something from you that is impossible.  And people have every right to fight for their own survival.  Your survival includes trying to have a future life that you can enjoy. If your parents have put you in a position where you MUST lie, then the blame for that can only belong to them. YOU ARE NOT TO BLAME FOR THIS. YOU SHOULD NOT FEEL GUILTY ABOUT ANYTHING.  Be strong and patient and do what you have to do to survive. You absolutely deserve to have a happy life.  All my best wishes to you."
askgaybros,3dkbti,Zoomjet3,1 point,Fri Jul 17 02:49:05 2015 UTC,"First of all I think it's really courageous to be so open to your parents. I think ""fake marriages"" are usually made because someone is afraid of telling their surrounding and especially their parents, but less frequently because their parent requested so.  Now no matter what happens between you and your parents, please don't kill yourself. You said that you have good friends and like your education and I'm happy for you about this.  I think parents often initially disagree with the lives their children ""want"" to live because of initial scepticism but then later when they see that it ""works"" they sort of accept it. I am not sure though how dependent on them you are. A way not to lie but have them be ok with it might be to make sort of a deal that you will not tell it to more people right now so they don't lose ""face"". Not sure though if they would be ok with it just like that and also whether you'd be ok with this.  I guess it must all be very hard, but I think realizing that you are gay means almost always to start questioning existing moral values, though that's it also with growing up anyway.  What I might advise you is trying to (maybe online) get to know other gays in China, not for dating but to ask them how they dealt with their parents since they might have good advice for you.  Head up you will find love, and maybe at some point your parents will realize that it's not a ""sickness"" but actual love and then everything will be fine again."
askgaybros,3dkbti,SweetheartDiva,1 point,Fri Jul 17 08:47:15 2015 UTC,"So sorry dude that you are going through such a horrible experience.    I can't relate exactly, because my family is Indian, and they are pragmatists who just turn a blind eye to anything they don't want to deal with.  I get the impression that it must be much more difficult in China with the whole issue of ""face"".    But first of all no one could possible consider it unreasonable that you don't get married, or have a pretend relationship with a woman, for the next six years while you are studying.  The standards in China are so intensely competitive that surely everyone will understand that you just don't have time to get married.    Secondly, it would be unkind to trap a woman into a loveless marriage, and you are just going to have to put your foot down and not do that.    It must feel terrible at the moment, but you have your brother on your side, and in time your parents are going to come around.  Have you watched The Wedding Banquet?"

askgaybros,3dl9dm,somekook,2,Fri Jul 17 06:01:54 2015 UTC,"By ""almost no"" means no cited case, which if it were about anything but sex would be ""no"".  Herpes is everywhere and so ubiquitous as to be statistically no more prevalent in bathhouse patrons than in the general population. Stubborn syphilis and gonnorhea is present, but not in any kind of proportion outside the norm, unless the norm is cruising church socials. Casual sex has risks but manageable and treatable, and unlikely if you're careful.  Because bathhouses are frequented so often by guys who are stepping out on a partner or a marriage ironically they're probably even more cautious than most. Apart from the occasional tweaker chewing the inside of his mouth out, of course."

But the gay issue is more of a legitimate issue with mass-scale blood donating because every now and then HIV blood manages to slip through the cracks of testing; either by human error or the 1/10,000 false negative. On a massive scale its just harder to control the risks; but with the donor and donee being right in the same facility, they can easily screen both of you for illnesses and other issues; so that's why being gay doesn't matter in organ donating."

I see the message; but can't quite think of what to say; especially if they send a very short message. so I set my phone down for 30 seconds; planning on coming up with a good reply 5 minutes later. Then suddenly I check the clock and realized hours and hours passed without me replying; and as time goes on I only feel worse and worse for not replying.  Then after 24 hours elapse; I'm usually still interested in the guy; I want to see them again; but I can't think of any good excuse to why I didn't text them back. in reality; I'm just spacey; and they are brand new in my life; its not a habit yet to text them diligently.   but after the 24hr point they usually never text me back; and I feel like a horrible person for not replying, I really did want to see them again; but even if I came up with a cheesy lie as to why I went AWOL after a first meet; they would still think I'm just not interested.  idk how common this is; or if any other guys do this. But for me its just a bit of social anxiety. If the conversation doesn't 'flow' and the other person isnt doing at least 50% of the conversation effert; Im just terrible at single handedly making up for the conversation disparity.

Reason being is the integrity of a plan/date/outing varies from person to person, some people never forget, some people make a plan willy nilly and always oversleep and say ""fuck it"".  So what might have happened is he was the latter person and forgot/didn't think much of it and when the time came and you texted him ""where are you"" he freaked out and saw you as clingy and needy contrast to his noncaring behavior.  In other words you didn't get stood up if you forgot to reconfirm the plans the day of, its just how it is. Also this kinda stuff happens all the time in early relationships, you're link to him is tenuous so any little thing might lead to him being nice to you and then next day deciding to write you off.

askgaybros,3dkf0l,Tiki_Torch,1 point,Fri Jul 17 11:32:30 2015 UTC,"It's not just Leviticus   1 Timothy 1:9-11    [...] those who are lawless and rebellious, for the ungodly and sinners, for the unholy and profane, for those who kill their fathers or mothers, for murderers and immoral men and homosexuals and kidnappers and liars and perjurers, and whatever else is contrary to sound teaching, according to the glorious gospel of the blessed God, with which I have been entrusted.    Romans 1:26-27    Because of this, God gave them over to shameful lusts. Even their women exchanged natural relations for unnatural ones. In the same way the men also abandoned natural relations with women and were inflamed with lust for one another. Men committed indecent acts with other men, and received in themselves the due penalty for their perversion.    Jude 1:7    [...] Sodom and Gomorrah and the surrounding towns gave themselves up to sexual immorality and perversion. They serve as an example of those who suffer the punishment of eternal fire.    1 Corinthians 6:9    Do you not know that the wicked will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived: Neither the sexually immoral nor idolaters nor adulterers nor male prostitutes nor homosexual offenders.   To quote just a few."
askgaybros,3dkf0l,Beetlejuicetwo,0,Fri Jul 17 22:03:37 2015 UTC,"Yes and Timothy echos Pauls writings, Romans is about ceremonial orgies, Jude never mentions homosexuality (the true sin is listen in Ezekiel 16:49 and is crystal clear, not to mention the cities were marked for destruction before the angels scene) and Corinthians again, is Pauls letter which was incorrectly translated.   I've read many translations of the Bible many many times and researched these passages many many times."

I think part of it is that the Catholic experience (and the guilt that comes with it) is a tad different from the Protestant sects that I have seen, in that, the Catholic church is the same church and they're never going to change their viewpoints on things like, say, marriage equality. I want to say I still believe, but it's hard when there are so many things with the church that I disagree with.  I'm not sure... At this point, I'm pretty much rambling I think, and drinking wine at this hour isn't helping lol. I may end up submitting a post of my own."

askgaybros,3dkf0l,John2Nhoj,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:02:31 2015 UTC,"Technically, yes, but even that has been difficult for me to understand. I was baptised in the Catholic church, and I've gone on to do other sacraments, and I still believe in Christ and God, but I've stopped going to church. Not that I necessarily have a problem with church, but as I mentioned before, there are plenty of things that I disagree with the Catholic viewpoint on, marriage equality being one of many.   So, okay, I stopped going to church, but apparently, if you are made a member of the Catholic church, that membership is for life. I think you can only fully renounce the church if you write a letter to your bishop or something to that effect. And I'll be honest, that thought is a little scary to me, because it's not like I'm renouncing my faith in Christ, I just have a few disagreements with the church as an organization, which I feel is totally different.   I would love to continue going to church, but I need to work my way back up there. But, I'm just not sure that it will be at a Catholic church. I have a friend in divinity school currently that I opened up to about my current state in life, and she began to recommend Episcopal churches to me, as apparently they are more welcoming and open. I like the idea, so I may check those out."

The pics he sent me (which I found out later) were of him when he was in college. In those pictures he was toned and had an amazing body. We chatted for maybe two weeks and seemed to click on a lot of things. We were planning on going on a date when one day he sends me a video of him jerking off on kik and it was obvious that he was overweight.  I was a fat kid growing up so I know the symptoms all too well. He had a very noticeable fat pad. He had very plump fingers too. To top it off, his dick was much smaller than other pics he had sent me (probably cause of the fat pad).  I felt terrible.

It came off as threatening too as he said ""I know you have nudes"" before the name bit.  No idea who he was, I didn't recognise the pictures so I assume they were fake same with the name, said he would only tell me who he was if i sent nudes  Yeah, no. He only came online once more and that was it. Super glad I don't randomly send nudes to people, don't even want to think about what would have happened if I had.

My doctor advised me to change careers for physical health reasons so I went to college for a Social Service Worker degree. I got my degree in at risk LGBTQ youth studies.

There isn't one emergency youth homeless shelter in all of Canada specifically for or even directed towards LGBTQ youth yet like the USA 40% of our homeless youth identify somewhere in the LGBTQ alphabet. At best some shelters in major cities have LGBTQ acceptance guidelines but the big problem with the shelters that do have very few if any staff with LGBTQ background or knowledge.  To make it even worse many of our homeless shelters are administered by religious based organizations and the religious based discrimination is rampant in these organizations.

He was a cool guy to talk to, and a lot more on the ball than I was in college!   So, anyway, it can be done, and by people older than you.

I think I have like 1 friend who's older than me.  Anyways, realize that when it comes to college, people will not care how old you are. They're supposed to be there to study, but even in social situations....they won't care. People won't think less of you because you're older.   And if it makes you feel better, at my age I'll be going back to school in January. Yes, I'll be way older than most of the student body. Buuuuut, don't care. I'm not there for them."

Planning on following up with a Maser's in epi, which won't start until I'm at least 44-ish.  Age brings advantages in that you tend to be more focused, know better what you want, and have better time management skills. As a group, the older students in my program regularly out perform the younger ones simply because we don't dick around and waste time.  Your age at 25 shouldn't be much (if any) of an issue. You're still plenty young for your peers to see you as relatable. It changes when you're into your 30s and beyond - despite making efforts to get to know people, be kind/helpful and treat other students as equals, I'm generally ignored by the student body when it comes to social interaction. They're polite to me, but to them I'm little more than a study resource to be used to help them pass exams. University is the first time in my life where I actually feel old, because I'm treated as such. You'll be fine at your age, though - people in their mid-20s are usually treated just like everyone else."

Anyway, once his life settled down again, he realized he'd gotten as far as he could in the tech world without a degree so he went back. He actually went back for a degree in economics (he's into Nate Silverman style predictive analytics). Since he was settled down and working full time he had laser focus and did phenomenally well in his studies.  Don't worry about the age gap. Honestly, 25 barely looks different than 21.

You'll definitely notice the age difference, especially in your first year classes, but you'll also realize that the age difference doesn't really matter. You won't be the youngest person there, and you won't be the oldest.   From my perspective, starting my degree later on was the best choice I could have made. I feel like I was able to more clearly focus on my education. Many people in university are there because it's the 'thing to do' after high school. You'll be there because you want to be there, and you already have a very clear plan of what you're going to do.   I was able to enjoy a fair amount of success throughout my undergrad (I presented papers at several conferences, got published in a peer reviewed journal, and was fortunate enough to do a Smithsonian internship) and I attribute this mostly to the fact that I started my degree at the point in my life that I did. I'll be starting my masters in the History of Art and Design this fall.   Long story short, you'll be awesome. Work hard and enjoy yourself :)"

When I was an undergraduate, I tutored many 25+ y.o. students (not necessarily because they needed it, but because they wanted to be certain they would succeed). When I worked in classroom as an assistant, I noticed that many of these older students were more prepared and often performed better than their younger peers.  If you ask me, I feel that many attend college/university before they're really ready. Many have just left high school, but are still stuck in the high school mentality. Yes attending a university is a great time to make friends and socialize, but learning should be the primary goal if you're going to be taking on any debt.   Just be sure to get to know a handful of your professors, get involved in research or a community service group on campus, et cetera. Make sure that by the time you finish your 4 year degree, you know a few professors and other faculty (no less than 3) who are willing to provide references for whatever you might be wanting to do after graduation.   I have met many 4.0 GPA students who have no references and had a difficult time finding employment/entering graduate school. I had a slightly lower GPA, but my references were the heads of academic/disability services, a handful of professors, a couple of supervisors at my internships, et cetera. I had my pick of the litter for universities because the references I listed were very good and I was also able to ask these references for feedback on my application letters."

Most likely, no one will be able to tell that you're older, and even when you tell them they won't think it's a big deal because it isn't. It's just a few years difference.   Really, this age gap is all in your mind. I'm 30 now. I look back at when I went to school at 25 and I'm like ""dude, 25 is young, it's totally the right time to go back to school!"" Just do it and stop being afraid of what everyone else thinks. I can't imagine having gone to college at 18. I was such a hot mess. I would have probably majored in business, hated it and if I graduated, it would have been with a 2.0.

askgaybros,3di0bf,Zoomjet3,2,Fri Jul 17 08:35:20 2015 UTC,"Well, I disagree with all the other comments...but maybe they're right and I'm wrong. Here's what I think... Your friend sounds like he has a lot of problems, made worse by cocaine. And by the way, his difficulty with erections may be due to cocaine.  He sounds like he's really struggling and it sounds like you are VERY important to him. I think he is flooded by feelings about a lot of things and doesn't know what to do with his feelings. ESPECIALLY, his feelings for you. So at times, MAYBE HE DOES feel sexually about you. I think that could explain what sounds like many double signals. If I were in your position, I'd be confused about him too.  I'm not saying that you should do the following but here's something to think about... Maybe you could tell him that you really love him. And that love sometimes makes you feel sexually toward him. But that there's no need for the two of you to ever act on it. That it's just an aspect of your love for him. And that you treasure his friendship.  And then see what he has to say about that !!! It would certainly be interesting.  And from what you said, he already knows that you have some bisexual feelings. So telling him that some of your feelings are  directed toward him might not come as a shock to him. It might even make the two of you closer. And hopefully, he would respond by truthfully to tell you if he has  similar feelings toward you.  I wish we could find out how this story ends !!"
askgaybros,3di0bf,BillyIsUnstuck,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:38:02 2015 UTC,"My love for him is nothing more than that for a friend/brother, let's call it a deep male-to-male bond and connection. The ones I've only loved have always been women in terms of emotion.  Sexually speaking, as I already told, I'm more towards the gay part right now, even if I've never done anything else. I've never thought of him in sexual terms, not even when I told him about my standing point. All this started just recently, but in my vision of man-to-man sex I'm not the kind of person who would do it at any moment and with any guy, it's somehow a ""curiosity"" that I'd like to explore together with someone else that shares my same confidence (basically someone you can really trust because of a deep bond) and who has the same curiosity.  In any case, I'll try to give him a talk once we'll manage to meet and spend some time together alone, that's not something that can be done through a phone call or message aww!"
askgaybros,3di0bf,Zoomjet3,2,Fri Jul 17 08:42:36 2015 UTC,"He absolutely sounds like someone who needs attention, but not a secretly-gay (or bi) guy. Sorry, I know you've convinced yourself otherwise, but nothing you mentioned makes me feel like he is anything but straight.  Look at the signs for his attention-seeking though:   Multiple affairs, but only once with each woman (doesn't care about finding a different relationship, he just enjoys the excitement of a one-night thing) -- he clearly loves having the attention of as many people as possible Constantly asking if you really love him -- this isn't a sign he's into you, this is a prompt that insecure people use to coax compliments from someone to reassure themselves and feel better about themselves. Trust me, as someone who has had a lot of insecurities this is very familiar behavior. The selfies & nude pictures -- he knows your sexuality, he knows how you feel about him, and I'm positive he gets a big kick out of sending those teasing pictures.  He's a model. As strange as it may seem, models are often the people with the biggest self-esteem issues. Their entire career is built around their image. They are constantly being observed & criticized in terms of their physical appearance; they are constantly being compared to other equally-beautiful people, and their images are constantly being altered through photoshop/etc to achieve the ""perfect"" images you see on magazines. Their reality can't even live up to the image most people have of them. They're constantly feeling inferior to their own selves, and that's not even starting on how they feel compared to other models. Finally, the drugs -- he clearly has a problem with them, and it's not unusual at all to use drugs to escape from personal issues like - hello - self-esteem issues.    TL;DR - He has killer self-esteem issues and needs attention to alleviate that distress. He also falls back on drugs for the same reason. Maybe, maybe, he has had some sort of sexuality confusion, but I would bet big money that any sort of confusion in his sexuality is due entirely to either (A) His modeling career - stereotypes of models, the jokes of people regarding his career, the constant focus on the body, etc, (B) His self esteem issues - feeling dissatisfied with yourself & others can lead to a serious identity crisis and sometimes people will question every aspect of themselves just out of an emotional reaction."

You being gay, and not out, leaves a higher impact on you when you are called gay. So basically you are making it bigger than it seems."

Unfortunately sometimes that choice is not available, and we are forced out by circumstance.  If people think you are gay, either by boys harrassing you, or girls who want a cliched BFF you have 3 options. These are not ideal, but unfortunately its the situation which you are in.  Why? who knows. maybe its just a vibe. maybe just some guys decided to be assholes you you. The fact that girls ask you indicates you give off more that you are aware. I know some girls who just had a killer gaydar. Anyway:   Say nothing, this wont help Pretend to be straight. How good an actor are you? can you talk about girls convincingly to the guys? can you insult them back as one of their friends would? Can you flirt with girls and get a girlfriend? Its all very much harder to do in reality than on paper. Convincing lies, like acting, required alot of preparation, work, and consistency. Its essentially method-acting, and you have to overcome what a whole bunch of people already think about you. Come out. The boys insults will become meaningless. Own the word. Own being out. 'hey gay boy!', 'what? you want me to fuck you again?' Its a different scenario dealing with conflict when you are not hiding anything. Coming out of course depends on friends, family, community, and a whole bunch of other personal factors.   Unfortunately youre options to make this a better decision in the long term are limited.

askgaybros,3dh6ns,odwilliams,9,Thu Jul 16 06:18:42 2015 UTC,"ive gone through stages of high-functioning alcoholism. Thats more because i love the feeling and taste of alcohol. Wine is my favourite substance on the planet. Gay-related depression doesnt really have much to do with it, although in phases when i have felt down, i have drunk more than i should have.  Alcohol is the most readily available numbing agents we can get, and theres any number of gay guys have internal issues regarding sexuality so turn to alcohol as a solution.  What you are describing is a different level level of self destructive alcholism. You are avoiding dealing with the world sobre, get smashed and cant deal with the world hungover and sobre, and get into a terrible neverending cycle of hoplessness.  Thats what alcohol does. Its a depressant. It makes ourselves feel terrible, and because we feel terrible we drink more to briefly feel good from the numbing effect.  Theres two things you need to do.   Learn to talk to people sober. This requires balls to get used to, but the more people you have free and open conversation with, especially about sexuality, the easier it gets. Get off the booze. AA isnt for everyone - i preferred Alan Carrs book for changing how i think about alcohol.   Youre avoiding dealing with your issues and peace with your own sexuality because your getting drunk all the time. Its a form of procrastination  as much as anything. You will never be happy while you keep on drinking."
askgaybros,3dh6ns,electric_monk,3,Thu Jul 16 06:58:58 2015 UTC,"I came out of college quite recently thinking that drinking twice a week was normal and that I could keep it up as a routine.  In the past year I've been very lonely, so I got into the habit of drinking by myself. I don't think it's the worst thing, but I'm not so destructive about it. In June/May it got bad though. I think there was a week I drank about 4 times and got drunk on all of them and just felt shiity, and I was also depressed about the situation I was in - having no friends within hundreds of miles of me, cheating boyfriend that I thought was perfect, weight gain, unsuccessful job hunting. I don't consider myself an alcoholic because I don't do it every day and these past couple of weeks, I've mostly forgot about it and don't lust after it. Maybe I went through a phase? It wasn't getting in the way of my life, it was just something that I'd do towards the end of the night to make me feel better.. There was just one crazy day that I was on vampire mode and woke up in the late afternoon, and ended up drinking a bottle of wine while watching Netflix and cleaning my room very early in the morning the next day until I was tired.  About being gay and drinking - this is how I came out to like 80% of my friends, I think. I was in a frat, and I had a boyfriend I didn't want to make feel uncomfortable. Looking back it was kinda heroic, but also awkward. Also, drinking really helps me break the ice with people in general - that's what I like about it the most. All of the dates I've been on have kicked off with alcohol. It's fair to me because I don't need to be drunk to interact with them, I just need to be a little bit tipsy to get rid of the nerves I have within the first half hour of meeting them. It's a social lubricant.. but like lube, you dont need to use the whole bottle to make things easier."

There are also a ton of people who develop drinking problems that are straight as an arrow. I've been in AA for a number of years now, and aside from the details of your story, I've heard that tale many, many times from different people with different lives.   I send you hugs and love, but also this thought: being caught up in your homosexuality and how it affects your drinking is most likely keeping you from addressing your problem. If you drink too much, get help for that. Even without knowing you, I feel so, so sure that you will be able to come to terms with being gay a whole lot more easily after you get help with your drinking problem. (PM me if you want to talk)"

askgaybros,3dh6ns,pisio,1 point,Thu Jul 16 11:14:19 2015 UTC,"I quit drinking 1.5 years ago and it's the best thing I ever did. I was not the ""stereotypical"" alcoholic by any means, but most of us aren't. There is still a lot of stigma about alcoholism. Before I quit, I did wonder to what extent my sexuality played a role, but now that I've had some sober time under my belt, I'm less concerned about that.  You see, there is a tendency for alcoholics or people in recovery to feel that they are alone or that there situations are somehow unique and this can contribute to their desire to drink. But everyone has these feelings, even if their lives seem perfect from the outside. These are feelings I continue to struggle with and need to manage to stay in recovery. So while I really have no issues with my sexuality in itself (I've been partnered for years, am out in all aspects of my life, have an accepting family, etc.), I do often struggle against myself as my own worse enemy. Drinking for me was and continues to be a way of escaping reality/destroying myself/rebelling, that I will never fully understand. That is why treatment and community are so important to recovery.  Its rough, because none of it really becomes clear until you stop drinking for awhile - and there is definitely a lot of heavy drinking in the world, especially in the gay community.   It seems sometimes like people are trying to prove they are not alcoholics, by drinking more and appearing ""functional."" It just makes no sense to me anymore, even though I used to be like that myself."
askgaybros,3dh6ns,RareEarthMinerals,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:23:50 2015 UTC,"I am a recovering alcoholic, and have been sober for a while.  I'm also gay.  Alcoholism as a disease definitely has many components to it, both mental and physical, and I definitely 'blamed' my alcoholism on my sexuality for a long while.  But I have learned that the two are not necessarily interconnected.  I was surprised to learn that most alcoholics struggle with feelings of loneliness, insignificance, and being different, both gay and straight.   I was also surprised to learn that most gays, even those who are enamored of the bar culture, do not black out every night (as I did.)  They go to gay bars to socialize, not to get obliterated.  Self-pity and feeling sorry for yourself are also huge emotional components of alcoholism, as is the feeling of hopelessness.  This is not limited to gays, nor is it limited to alcoholics, but it is a factor to consider.  I refused help for a long time because I felt like I deserved the problems I had.  Lots of self-loathing going on there for me.  Alcohol was my best friend.  Then, alcohol turned on me and became my worst enemy.  I struggled for a long time wondering why it happened, and then, finally, I just accepted it.  I was, for all intents and purposes, in an abusive relationship with booze.  It was time to stop making excuses for my ex-lover and seek help breaking off the affair.  So finding help is a simple as looking for it, just as a straight person would do.  While I sought help in Alcoholics Anonymous, I realize it is not for everybody.  However, AA does have gay meetings, as well as a pamphlet about the subject.  One final observation.  A lot of gays have issues with 'the god thing' in AA because of the attitudes of some anti-gay religious folks.  However, you stated in your post that you prayed to god to stay drunk.  It seems to me that, whether you were being facetious or not, you could use that same prayer or sentiment to stay sober.  Thanks for posting."
askgaybros,3dh6ns,pizzaforce3,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:17:49 2015 UTC,"While I don't consider myself an alcoholic, I definitely do enjoy drinking. HOWEVER I try and limit how much I indulge because I've been in places similar to where you are now. I never got to the point of drinking every day, but for a while I was drinking several times a week. Despite being around many friends, I wasn't doing it to socialize, I was doing it to access a deeper part of myself that I was too afraid to venture into sober. Like you I would wake up with bloody nuckles having only faint memories from the night before. I was so rage filled; I had suppressed so much about myself (not even just sexually) for so long, that those feelings apparently needed an outlet.  Coincidentally this drinking coincided with/facilitated my coming out. It provided the ""courage"" to admit to someone else (and myself) that I was attracted to one of our mutual friends. After downing a glass of alcohol that should barely even be smelled let alone slammed, several of my friends agreed that I needed to be escorted back home. On our walk back from the bar, I felt that my mind was about to break: I felt that urge to connect with someone, to divulge this exhausting secret. I finally made the decision to jump, and, in typical me fashion, wanting to avoid the word gay at all costs, I attempted to ""euphemize"" coming out by saying something like ""I've never been more attracted to X in my life."" Immediately following with ""I've never told anyone that I like men before"" :////// Obviously assuming I was gay my friend just said ""Well I don't blame you; he's a super attractive guy""  For some reason this made my brain explode. ""what?! I just (ostensibly) revealed a huge thing about myself to this person and the world didn't end/they didn't punch me in the face/puke all over me?!""  I had several more reinforcing experiences like this during this trip (I forgot to mention I was living abroad and there were ridiculous opportunities for cheap alcohol/partying). I gradually understood that being gay didn't really matter, or at least didn't HAVE to matter, as much as it had in my mind.   I understand being surrounded by people that are supportive is a luxury not everyone has, but opening up about my sexuality to another human being really precipitated realizations that put me on (the very long) path to self acceptance and has provided me with a great deal insight into my own mind.  That was an incredibly long-winded way of saying that on some level, I feel you. Alcohol has been an incredibly positive yet destructive force in my life, but I've found that dealing with my own psychological hang-ups/issues has (after a long while) allowed me to enjoy some of it's sweeter fruits.  Anyway, I think that maybe (obviously speaking from my own anecdotal experience) it would be beneficial for you to find someone that you can connect with/ talk to, be it a friend or a counselor or a therapist.   Goodluck"

At most universities I'm aware of, at least for Master's and PhD coursework, such an assignment would raise a lot of red flags and likely wouldn't be allowed.  Either this guy is just being a douche-nozzle or he really was given this as an assignment. In the latter case, you can often look up nearby colleges and universities course catalogs on their website. If you do find the professor of the course, you need to lodge a complaint against him.

It will probably make your boyfriend feel better in the long run too, because nobody wants to feel like they're in a relationship for the sole reason that they're the first person who came along.  It seems like you both understand that your curiosity about other guys and desire to experiment/sleep around a bit is only going to become more of a real problem the longer it goes unfulfilled.

Honestly I'm quite happy I did that (still do). It made it really clear for me that what my bf gives me nobody else can and what I feel for him is unique -he is the only guy I ever made love with. It even made our relationship stronger, because I know I'd choose him above any other guy out there. I'm madly in love with him.  Besides, I know I'm sure I deeply love him. I love having sex with him, even if he is not physically nor the age I always liked (he is significantly older than me). I fell in love with him because of who he is, regardless of appearances.

You got close to him, did things together that he didn't do with his other friends. I think it might be worth considering the fact that he may have developed some feelings for you.  Even if they weren't all that serious, it still may have freaked him out. Especially considering the fact that you mentioned that this was years ago. People in general were less accepting, guys were less likely to identify as bi or even more so gay..  The fact that he may have caught done feelings toward you may have freaked him out enough to just cut ties altogether. It's unfortunate, but I think it's pretty realistic. Even more so if this was a decent amount of time ago.. I have very good straight male friends who I have very similar relationships with, and they are very secure in their sexuality.

I was okay with that. And then, as these stories go, he changed. All of a sudden, he started lying to me and making excuses for not hanging out.   Something tells me we're not getting the full picture. Did you confide in him your crush? If yes, then you changed the dynamic of your friendship and he couldn't handle this.   Did he know about your sexuality? People don't like being misled. This guy was confiding in you, but by keeping your sexuality a secret may have made him rethink on whether the friendship was just one way, i.e. you getting info from him."

My best friend came out after high school and one of the hardest things he has to deal with, as far as I can tell, is having to repeatedly come out to people. He feels like he's not really being himself if people don't know he is gay, but at the same time why is that such a defining characteristic? Why should he, or anyone of any sexual orientation, feel the need to constantly tell people who he is attracted to simply because his sexuality isn't the 'norm'?   I think if OP was attempting to manipulate this friend by not telling him, and only wanted to be involved romantically, then yes it would be deceitful. I don't think he should have to announce his sexuality to everyone he wants to be friends with as a preemptive measure in order to not ""mislead them."" He has literally been the same person all along.

It never came up, and at the time I sorta thought I might be bi.  And his lying really wasn't all of a sudden, but it seemed that way at the time.  He was one of those guys who liked to ""front""... he often played up certain parts of himself.  And he kept saying shit like ""people don't know the real me.""  This added another layer to my confusion (which is why I thought he might be gay.  At the time, I joked to myself he'd be the sort of guy to come screaming out of the closet in his 40s!  haha)  As an update, he's married to a woman and has kids now.  Not that any of that means anything.  ;-)  Also, your last comment strikes a chord.  He at one point said something like he didn't know I felt like we were close friends.  Which is a lie, because I told him on several occasions (both in word and deed).  Apparently, he didn't notice or chose to ignore it.  My suspicion is some others in the thread are right that his friends ""got to him.""  After all, there was a reason he wanted to hang out with me instead of them... and then chose to devote himself to them entirely. :-/"
askgaybros,3dfbzg,MyPaynis,0,Thu Jul 16 05:30:01 2015 UTC,He may have picked up on the fact that you had a crush on him so he decided to distance himself to not lead you on or the crush made him feel uncomfortable because he was only comfortable being friends.

askgaybros,3di3dw,aghaiz,4,Thu Jul 16 13:25:06 2015 UTC,"It's not a natural consequence of bottoming, but bottoming can certainly aggravate hemorrhoids.    Sounds like you're one of those guys who just really likes getting fucked... good!  But it also sounds like you jumped into the deep end a little too quickly.  First, get that thing under control, use the creams and go easy for a week or so.  If it persists, talk to a doctor.  Next time, use more lube, go more slowly.  Stretch yourself out gently with toys beforehand, practice with toys regularly if you're not getting fucked regularly (more than once a week)."
askgaybros,3di3dw,indomante,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:26:03 2015 UTC,"Thank you for the advice.  Yeah I got a good thing with the bf. Both get hard and get off while taking it so we've been rotating. Like topping just as much.  I just assumed if it doesn't hurt I'm fine but I guess not. He did get a little more into it this last time as far as thrusting which felt great but could be a factor.   So are toys essential? Basically we'd start on top of the other, Take our time getting it in and then go from there. This has been pretty painless except for now which isn't even that bad. Just weird it's 4 days after having sex rather than a day or two.  I should add I'm a pretty relaxed guy by nature that works out a lot so controlling my muscles and relaxing them is easy for me. First guy I've had sex with, trust him and like him so all nerves and fear of bottoming don't exist .

askgaybros,3dikti,hrewrewrw,8,Thu Jul 16 15:45:37 2015 UTC,PrEP is pre-exposure and PEP is post-exposure. HIV-negative people who are at risk of coming into contact with HIV take PrEP once a day to reduce their risk of HIV infection. HIV-negative take PEP within 72 hours of a probable HIV contact to reduce their risk of infection.   Truvada is one of the many drugs HIV-positive people might take to treat HIV. Truvada is also the only pill approved for PrEP for HIV-negative people at this time.   Got it? Good.
askgaybros,3dikti,Firmicutes,3,Thu Jul 16 16:21:36 2015 UTC,"Slightly outdated but not weird. Truvada can be prescribed alone for PEP, and it's been effective, but current guidance in the US is a more complete cocktail to minimize the risk as much as possible.  If you're concerned about your exposure, call the prescribing doctor and have them check the current CDC guidelines. They can then write you a script for an additional drug."

The same drug is being used to prevent infection, to treat an exposure, and to treat someone living with the disease.  With all that being said, if Truvada is being used to prevent infection, wouldn't someone who is already positive and taking Turvada by logic not be able to transmit?  It makes a strong case for why the safest people to have sex with (in terms of not getting HIV from) are undetectable guys who are adherent to their meds."

K-Lube, J-Lube - basically veterinary lube can be pretty good, but I find it works best when mixed with something like boy-butter or elbow grease. The J-Lube makes it super slick, and the elbow grease gives it more lasting power.  For normal fucking, I like just a bit of high quality silicone lube - a little can go a long way.

askgaybros,3dfgfn,John2Nhoj,2,Wed Jul 15 21:39:44 2015 UTC,This sounds like a BIG FAT excuse.   You can set a stationary gym bike to be harder to peddle than most situations you would find yourself peddling a real bike in the outdoors. There are also many other machines in a gym besides a stationary bike that will do more for your physique than just a stationary or real bike can.   You just have to be willing to make the investment in your self and your health.   Try to get a friend to go with you and make it a regular social event. If you go by yourself take some music and ear-buds with you. Listening to music you like while you exercise helps to make the time seem like it goes a lot faster. If you know the lengths of the songs you can use the music as a timer to tell you how long you've been doing an exercise and even push yourself to make it through the next song.

After a few months, you just get into the habit of it. I've been going solo to the gym for a while now (the gym buddy moved away temporarily), and force of habit still keeps me going.  Additional motivation for me is now coming from the endorphin high I get during and after lifting. I'm still struggling emotionally after my fiance ended our engagement, but everything almost seems alright after a good gym session (hence the fact I'm going 5-7 days a week now).

There's no preparation aside from showing up and the community atmosphere helps keep things with accountability in line.

I keep track of my steps using a jawbone fitness bracelet.  It alerts me if I sit longer than 45 minutes.  I set a goal of 10k steps a day, and I get up and walk for a few minutes every hour at work. Just little things I can add to my routine that I can do without making a big deal out of it.  Part of it is when I quit smoking I replaced all those breaks with small periods of exercise, so no it's just natural for me to do them."
askgaybros,3dfgfn,nosemaker,1 point,Thu Jul 16 04:38:42 2015 UTC,"I would say your best bet is to force yourself into the habit of going to the gym. The hardest part is the first month or so. After that you lose the ""should I go to the gym or not today"" back and forth that happens in your head right before you pass the turn to go there. After a month of incorporating the gym into your daily routine, like right before or after work (I prefer after since you can be late to the gym, but not work), you will not even think about it anymore and just go automatically."

askgaybros,3dg0ad,FriesBaconNaked501,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:36:49 2015 UTC,"I agree. Its a power thing to an extent. I mean certainly it seems like there's this paradigm in the gay world/hookup casual sex scene of: small cock=bottom Big=top. Small=submissive Big=Dominant. At the sametime though i think its more complex than that. I mean in general terms the western world is alot more judgmental, disdainful, ostracizing, nasty, harsh, hostile & shallow when it comes to a small penis than it ever is to a big penis. It can be tough & downright brutal if you don't match up. Afterall we live in society that covets, idealolizes big cocks. Bigger is better is mantra of our times, big dick=alpha, big dick=masculinity, its tied up in notions of being the winner, a superior real man come sex god, a big dick means one has an intrinsic value. It opens more doors(no pun). A big one is seen as an item of lust n envy, something to be praised n proud of(despite the owner doing nothing to earn it). These are all messages we're bombarded with indeed, it feeds into the large cock obsession as you noted imo.  On top of all that they're isn't any negative stigma, brutal emasculating/shaming,, mockery or real negative conatation attached to a big dick/its owner like there is with a small dick for instance, your sense of masculinity & what it means to be a male will never be questioned either. Our society validates big dick guys. Nobodies ever gonna commit suicide cuz their dick is big, like increaingly more & more small/average guys do. Its not about the dick per se, its just a penis. Its about all the things a big dick is associated with.  You see as a small dicked young(20, 4.5x4.1) gay guy top i've seen for myself how small penis is seen as a bad thing in todays world, its an item of mockery to be held in contempt & dirision. And thus by extension its owner is too. When your small your not shielded from the the putrid underbelly of western culture, the backwardness, the nastyness, brutal emasculation & hostility that pervades, people seemingly see a small one as fair game in a way they wouldn't for any other genetic trait we have no control over. A small penis is not an item of lust or envy like a big one either, its viewed as a joke, its owner a looser joke, not taken seriously, small penis=bad guy etc. As a small guy your viewed as a contemptible freak-show and not a human/sexual being with feelings etc.  Society views you as lesser. Your shut out & ostracized from the hook up scene(relaationships too. I mean i've seen on dating sites, to most guys who are seeking a relationship, a big dick is just another item to be checked off of their laundry list, like ""not a serial killer"", ""doesn't live with mum"" and ""has a job.""). There is not much love & acceptance out there for a small penis. Either from porn(whether its pro or amateur there is no representation of small dick guys outside of creepy SPH stuff, its always big/above average everywhere, small dicks are hardly ever shown in a good light & just see how many everyday ppl list small ones as a turn off/dealbreaker) to everyday atittudes/media/pop culture with all the jokes & shaming which makes it socially acceptable.. Its an existance of rejection, vengful rageful anger, lonliness & bitterness, despression, insecurity too. Your suffering/grievences often dismissed & not taken seriously like a womens would be. Its not right or fair. I fucking hate 21st century western culture at the mo. Its off in the head. Makes me sick! :(. Ppl need to wake up."
askgaybros,3dg0ad,AlejoHoots,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:18:04 2015 UTC,"Yes, but if you're living in a Naturist lifestyle or attending Naturist events, nobody cares.  Interestingly, it seems to me that guys that evolved in the colder climates tend to have shorter penises, especially when flaccid and this would seem to reduce the chances of frostbite.  But, it's not the same for everyone.   I'm aware that there those that are seemingly obsessed with having larger penises.  That's their ridiculous hangup.  Similarly there are those that are extremely conscious and sensitive to the smaller penis issue.  To most people and especially in the Naturist lifestyle penis size is irrelevant and I think it's important to look at it with no more interest than nose, feet, ear or other body-part sizes.  Again, I know there are people that make it a big deal.......most of us don't, and we need put these things in perspective."

askgaybros,3dg0ad,AlejoHoots,2,Thu Jul 16 15:06:01 2015 UTC,"Agreed. I think the fact that a small dicked guy might have to point out ahead of time(as if its a bad thing) & that hes small despite the fact he look after himself as if he's a contemptible freak-show and not a human/sexual being with feelings etc... says alot about this big dick obsession, so highly emphsized at the expense of everthing else, coveted n put up on a pedistal as the best thing since sliced bread mindset thats so widespread these days as you noted.  It speaks volumes about the bigger is better, internet, phone-app, destructive, objectification, vapid, narcissistic, lacking in empathy, pornification, style over substance, instant gratification, soley/highly sexually driven & oversexed saturated culture that is gay culture, if not western culture at the moment. The small penis negative stigma that's the tale of our times...This paradigm it is simply the reflection of the gross vapidity, vulgarity, crudeness, cruelness, stupidity and superficiality that is rampant & de rigueur in today's society and amongest many of said society's male population(female too, but its defo more a male thing). Its sad really. How did we get to this point?. There's something seriously wrong & unhealthy with our culture on this issue imo. Makes me so angry. It also makes you realise just how retarded & backwards Western culture is on this issue. We're nowhere near as advanced or as enlightened as we like to think that we are.  As a small guy it pisses me off so much. I hate it. At this point as i don't see the culture changing anytime soon tbh, i think we smaller guys need to have our own hook up app or something as i sadly can't see people willing to speak up(for the reasons i mentioned below in my reply to FriesBaconNaked501) I wish they would though, they'd be a very brave person. A small one should be no different to how we view eyecolour really....small penis hate needs to.end.now. There's so much more to man than one small bit(no pun).

askgaybros,3dg0ad,naughtychemistry,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:23:52 2015 UTC,"It's one of the reasons I am trying to figure out how to be open about it which is hard because most people are like WHY ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT THIS? And I'm like because I'm an attractive guy who has no problem attracting men and I have internalized all these negative messages for decades and it has negatively affected my self-esteem and sexual performance.  I have a hard time feeling safe sexually.  I have been divorced from a natural desire to top (even though I love bottoming too).  I have a hard time maintaining an erection due to self-loathing and anxiety.  Therapy has not worked.  I have tried for a decade to solve this problem in therapy and I think the only thing that will work is to talk about it and unburden myself of the shame.    I know many men think there's nothing wrong with me, but when I was an impressionable young person I got the message there was.  I got it from my mom, I got it from going to bars at a time there was a hit song called ""Short Dicked Man"" and everyone in the bar was singing along to it, I got it from casual comments where people have no issues at the dinner table or what not attacking small penises and no one countered what they said or just laughed.  Maybe I'll make a fool of myself, but I'm starting to think my peace of mind and self-worth are more important than some fool's misguided opinion and I am starting not to care.  I just hope I can do this in a way that's productive and helpful and I want to make sure I reach out to others like me who want to find positive ways to eroticize an intimate part of our bodies that society is hell bent on making us feel awful about.

Can't imagine anything other than that will happen to OP's friend.  Only way out of this for OP's friend to get independent, and then say to his mother ""Choose. Now."", when he's ready to never come back.  It may end up with the family backtracking their position, like mine did (ish), or it may not.  He's going to be miserable no matter what, and it's not going to get better, only worse. OP's friend's family as he knew it is over, plain and simple. If he wants to drag it out and have an elephant in the room, fine, but it's only going to get worse each passing day, to the point where OP's friend will have nothing but hate and contempt for his parents.  Speaking from experience (might be a bit skewed, but 12 years of what OP's friend is going through do give me some perspective), the only way to deal with this is for him to work on getting 100% independent, and just slam the door overnight, not looking back. You cannot reason with, or expect change, from people like that."
askgaybros,3ddfgi,__Miguel_,6,Wed Jul 15 12:44:05 2015 UTC,"I agree with all of the above! My parents acted okay at first, then turned on me. When they threatened to not cover any of my college tuition I told them I wouldn't go and then they'd be the reason I amounted to nothing, so they back tracked. Over the years (yes, years sadly) they've came around. It's not going to be an overnight thing, but once you make it clear that they have choices to make about how much they are in your life they may decide they took the wrong approach. Right now OP is letting his parents have the power and run the ship, he needs to gain control so he can force them to make their own choices."
askgaybros,3ddfgi,shanthology,12,Wed Jul 15 13:27:40 2015 UTC,First things first. You need to tell your friend that you care. And that your life would be infinitely worse without him. Then ask him to always always call you or anyone if he has suicidal feelings.   Second. There isn't a whole lot to do besides tell him that even if his family refuses to understand that you'll be there for him. And that you know this isn't a choice and that he isn't corrupt or evil incarnate but a person who was only trying to be honest.   Third. Hug your friend. He needs a dose of unconditional love that he isn't getting from his family. Don't try to move it past a hug. Just be there for him.   Forth tell him one day his parents may come around. And that in the future when he isn't as dependent on them if he wants to try again you'll be there for him. He can contact the local pflag for help or ideas on coming out. If his mother truly wants to get him counseling have him call up any local counselors first. Barring living in a really bad area they will all likely be lgbt friendly and may actually help his parents. There may even be a lgbt friendly church around too.   Moral of the story is be there for him. He probably feels terribly alone right now and will for a while. Let him know that you care.

askgaybros,3ddfgi,theGreenMarmot,3,Wed Jul 15 19:54:09 2015 UTC,"Hey I get your friend, I have had this happen a few times with my ultra conservative family. Sometimes we must re-closet and lie to our families for survival and it sucks and is extremely damaging. Be there for your friend, he needs you (goto coffee and discuss how he feels)! Maybe these resources can help him deal with your homophobic family who is Christian. The Documentary is a good place to start and maybe watch some Youtubes on the Bible verses. The books would be a good thing to use or give possibly to his mom if she is receptive.  I grew up in a similar situation as yourself and while my family never accepted me being gay; I choose to love them still but distance myself by becoming self-sufficient and being able to leave if things get bad. Some parents never understand and push their agenda of hate on their child or throw them out. His mom is scared and reacting badly. I would suggest letting things cool down and regrouping for next steps to get out of this situation. I choose to show my parents I am not like the hate they spew.

Staying in the closet might be the safest thing at the moment if he is not financially well off. Also getting a job while he is in school may help him save up money to be on his own. For me, I chose to stay in the closet since I am financially dependant on my parents but I have chosen to play by my parents rules to stay on their good side and so I can continue going to college.

askgaybros,3dewbt,signal-zero,12,Wed Jul 15 19:24:59 2015 UTC,"First and foremost, whether or not homosexuality is a choice is irrelevant. Homosexuality doesn't hurt anyone, so it isn't immoral. What goes on between consenting adults is no business of anyone else.  That being said, there is pretty clear evidence that it isn't a choice. The most succinct argument is that no one would choose to be gay when to do so would expose them to harsh discrimination. Think about it, why would anyone want to be rejected by their friends and family, to have fewer rights, in some places to even face the death penalty. The fact that people are unable to change their sexual orientation even in the face of persecution strongly suggests that it isn't a choice.  Biologically. There are several predictors of homosexuality. Genetics plays a role, though there are also non-genetic factors. If you have an identical twin who's gay, you're much more likely to be gay yourself. This correlation holds whether the twins are raised together or separately. Additionally, there is a stronger correlation between identical twins than between fraternal twins (roughly 50% for identical twins and 25% for fraternal twins), suggesting that genetics plays a role, not just the shared uterine environment.  Uterine environment plays a large role as well. The more older brothers a man has (more specifically, the more male fetuses carried by the same women to term prior to his birth), the more likely he is to be gay. This likely occurs because each male pregnancy changes the level of testosterone in the uterus for all subsequent pregnancies.  At first glance, homosexuality appears to be an evolutionary dead end, because homosexuals have, on average, fewer children. However, people without children can still pass on their genes by helping to ensure the survival of their other relatives (google the 'gay uncle hypothesis' for more on this). This ensures that the genes which predispose to homosexuality remain in the population. There is also some evidence that genes which are linked to male homosexuality are also linked to female fertility, thus explaining why they are not selected against."
askgaybros,3dewbt,Hexomin,4,Wed Jul 15 20:29:25 2015 UTC,"It's not not genetic.  Let's take identical twins. If one of them is gay, there is a 50 % chance that the other one is gay as well. (FYI Identical twins have the same genes)  Obviously 50 % is higher than what would have been expected. We can't say whether the increased chance is a result of the genes being prone to resulting in homosexuality, or if it is a caused by the two fetuses being exposed to similar conditions. I've heard theories about homosexuality in offspring being the result of altered hormone levels in the mother during pregnancy, and in the case of twins, this would obviously affect both of them. However, if we assume that the conditions are the same for the two infants, and they have the same genes, why is it then ""only"" 50 %?   A funny thing is also how widespread homosexuality is across different species. That makes it seem like it is evolutionary beneficial, but that is very counter intuitive, right? And if there is a ""gay"" gene, why would it not have died out by now, as homosexuals for obvious reason produce less offspring.  I think it is very interesting, and I would like to know why being gay is a thing. I guess it's kind of existentialistic for me, I would really like it to have purpose. I would love to see a TED talk on the matter, just like they made one called ""Why Some People are Left Handed"", but could you imagine how controversial that would be, if the subject was ""Why Some People are Homosexual"". Unfortunately, being gay is not as innocuous as being left handed."

askgaybros,3dewbt,lupicorn,1 point,Thu Jul 16 03:45:13 2015 UTC,"I think all the arguments other bros have given are all good angles to take.   When people ask me the science behind why some people are gay I like to flip it and ask why so many people are straight? All patterns in nature follow the natural distribution bell curve. That is, there should be some people who are exclusively homosexual and some people who are exclusively heterosexual and a whole lot of bisexuals. Our closest primate cousins, bonobos, are all bisexual and they have sex for everything. So it's curious that we now accept heterosexuality as the standard. We know historically, before the spread of religion, many cultures had no problems with the fluidity of sexuality or gender expression.   I do think for some people sexuality is immutable and to an extent down to factors out of our control but I think that's only at the far ends of the spectrum. Some research by a professor at NYU found that, when asked a different way (eg rather than just asking ""would you bang a dude"") most people who self identified as gay or straight actually fell somewhere on the bisexual spectrum. Very few people were exclusively monosexual. I'll have a look for that research later.   EDIT: here's the link https://flexuality.wordpress.com/bisexual/ I wish there were more access to the research and methodology. But I would say the findings don't deviate too far from something's I've encountered in my personal encounters with straight men and women."

askgaybros,3de2fq,a-base,2,Wed Jul 15 17:18:21 2015 UTC,"It sounds like you're playing the ""you're not the boss of me"" game with your mother. I can totally understand your mother wanting to talk to her husband about this. You've given no reason to keep this from your father other than you just don't want to. Seeing that your mother is very supportive and you expect your father to be supportive too I see no reason why you wouldn't do this for your mother. The lady supports you, the least you can do know is support her in dealing with the news that her son is gay."
askgaybros,3de2fq,electric_monk,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:47:13 2015 UTC,"Yeah, her need to gossip shouldn't trump your comfort.

askgaybros,3de2fq,John2Nhoj,5,Wed Jul 15 17:36:59 2015 UTC,"the only way to become comfortable with telling people you are gay is to do it more. If you avoid situations all the time because they are uncomfortable, youll never get anywhere."
askgaybros,3de2fq,Intel2407,3,Wed Jul 15 17:09:05 2015 UTC,"I get that, but remember;  you are the one who is gay and only you know how everything works and feels about being gay. Your mom will never fully understand any of that without having the experience of being gay herself. It sounds like she's doing the best she knows how, although clumsily as it may be, but she has her own needs etc., too that you may not understand not being straight or a woman yourself.   Holding back truths, no matter how important or well intentioned often has a way of backfiring sometimes and your being drunk was the catalyst that lead to the backfire.   Now that the ball has been served you may as well finish the game and allow the problem to be solved for all concerned. It may not have gone the way you wanted it to go, but it's not going to do anything devastating to you having gone another way instead.   This is just how I would handle the situation if I were in it. It's still only your call of course."
askgaybros,3de2fq,japanesehamantashen,4,Wed Jul 15 17:34:08 2015 UTC,"I agree that I'm being selfish. But I also think she's being selfish by giving me a deadline to come out to him. I probably will tomorrow, but still, I don't think it's her place to tell me ""You're coming out now"".  And the reason is not ""I do what I want"", it's ""I want some time to get my head around it because I've struggled with it for years and it's all a bit sudden""."
askgaybros,3de2fq,xMau5x,3,Wed Jul 15 17:12:57 2015 UTC,"All due respect, you lost the right to that argument by coming out to your mother. Be a man, come out to your father and let your parents talk to each other about their child. At the moment you are being inexplicably selfish and asking your mother to deal with this on her own, when she doesn't need to. GTFO the closet dude."
askgaybros,3de2fq,correon,7,Thu Jul 16 01:03:52 2015 UTC,"Congratulations on having parents in such a healthy relationship! You should be proud of them, and also grateful. You know, a lot of kids have to live in the same house as some parents who have an extremely shitty relationship, or even live in two houses because their parents are divorced.  Now, as part of your parents' healthy relationship, your mom doesn't keep secrets from your dad. Especially not secrets about family members. And with something as big as you coming out to her, that's definitely something she would like to talk about with her husband, don't you think? I'm sure she would love to share in the joy with him.  Yes, there are some cases where you should be able to tell a parent something and expect them to keep it a secret from the other parent. But in this case, you're asking her to keep a secret from her husband without having a good reason other than 'I don't want to'. Sorry, but that's not good enough! You yourself said you know you'll be accepted by him when you do come out. And yes, I do feel that people should be able to come out when and how they want, but I also feel that married couples should be able to talk to each other about things, and not be asked to keep secrets from each other. In this case I'm pretty sure the latter wins.  If you don't want to come out tomorrow to your dad, that's fine. Tell her that you need a week or two. But tell him soon. Don't selfishly strain your parents' healthy relationship by asking your mom to keep secrets for you without a good reason. The one thing I do agree with you on is that you should be able to ask your mom not to tell her sisters, because coming out to the rest of your family should be your decision, and it's much more reasonable to ask your mom to keep this secret from her sisters than her husband."
askgaybros,3de2fq,PsyAyeAyeDuck,5,Wed Jul 15 19:13:41 2015 UTC,IMO you are completely correct - explain it to her how you just explained it here.
askgaybros,3de2fq,NotAmused1001,3,Wed Jul 15 15:33:13 2015 UTC,"That's how I did explain it to her, but she still thinks I'm being selfish."

It's hard for her to walk around keeping this secret that you also have kept your entire life, so she wants you to make it easier for her?  So first off, everyone's being selfish and a little silly here.  And second, tell your Dad already."
askgaybros,3de2fq,cryptogrammar,3,Wed Jul 15 16:31:48 2015 UTC,Lopsided coming out situations always end up bad because either:     someone has to lie for you because you lumped them to your closet they will find out by someone else which can make a situation worse than it should be (i.e. not coming out in your own terms)   You forfeited your secrecy by telling your mother.  You can't claim secrecy after the fact.  Saying you don't feel like it seems incredibly lazy.  I bet you many people wish they had your situation.  That's a mighty fine luxury.
askgaybros,3de2fq,tescocola,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:09:54 2015 UTC,"Maybe your dad already knows and she just wants you to get it over with?  And honestly, if you have one supportive parent, that's much more than a lot of guys have."

Get it over and leave it in the past, go tell your dad. That said I was never able to come out to my dad face to face the traditional way , the way I finally did it was by introducing my BF at the time as my BF. So i see how it can be hard for you"
askgaybros,3de2fq,wmcdo04481,0,Wed Jul 15 17:18:52 2015 UTC,"I know that he knows haha. I guess my mum just wants me to get it over with. Which I will do. Just want to... I don't know... plan it out in my head a bit. Don't want to just go up and say ""Hey dad I'm gay"" as he's watching his favourite TV show."
askgaybros,3de2fq,ViveLaPhone,4,Wed Jul 15 17:23:02 2015 UTC,"Why not? Seriously, just fuckin do it. You already know that he knows. You already know that he'll accept it. At this point, you're just creating tension between you and your mother for pretty much no reason.  Who gives a shit whether he's watching TV or sitting with you face-to-face? Rip the damn bandaid off."
askgaybros,3de2fq,ViveLaPhone,2,Wed Jul 15 17:31:58 2015 UTC,"Really, that's exactly how you want to do it. You know he knows. And your mother knows he knows. You're right that it's your decision, but as you'll clearly have no problems telling him, the longer you leave it: A) the bigger of an issue it will be for you to tell him B) the more it will seem to him thy you have an issue with him  It's fair enough you don't want to be pressured into it, and you don't want the family gathering round to hear you say the magic words. But by not taking it in your own hands you are putting yourself at risk of being put into that situation involuntarily by your mother at some point in future. So when he's just watching TV on his own drop in and tell him, then leave the room and carry on as normal. Just get it over and done with and get on with your life!"

I know you want to have a good long think about what you're going to say, but honestly, if it is a surprise to them (him) they probably won't take much in past the ""I'm gay"" bit anyway for the rest of the conversation.   But if he knows and have thought about it himself, there's nothing you have to explain. He might have a few questions though, and really you can't prepare for those, so just answer them honestly and openly. It's one of those moments where you can get it all out on the table, so don't over think it, just say it as it comes."
askgaybros,3de2fq,sdsorin,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:02:14 2015 UTC,Congrats! You are halfway there. Now just take a deep breath and decide where you go from here and why. You don't have to tell your dad right now if you do not want to because that is your decision. But you can at least tell your mom that they can talk about it. She can say that you came out to her and tell your dad that you'll come out to him in your time. I understand that coming out is a process but you have to understand that telling your mother while drunk forfeited some of your rights to that process. My suggestion: just get drunk and tell him
askgaybros,3de2fq,sdsorin,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:35:52 2015 UTC,"Just come out to your dad. Literally just walk up to him and say ""Hi Dad, I'm really sorry how sudden this is but I just had to tell you that I'm gay. Let's go eat.""  There's never going to be a very good time to do it, the ""right time"" you're waiting for is never going to come. It's always going to be awkward, whether you're coming out to a friend or your family or anyone, so just treat it like a bandaid and rip it off quickly."
askgaybros,3de2fq,sdsorin,2,Wed Jul 15 21:11:41 2015 UTC,"I say this because it sounds like you're in the same boat as me, with relatively accepting parents who aren't about to throw you out or anything. I wish I had the balls to come out earlier to them. You should really just do it :D"

askgaybros,3dfv4j,naughtychemistry,4,Wed Jul 15 23:08:13 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the first time I stuck my finger up my butt, I was expecting some incredible wave of pleasure to overtake me, but I was surprised to find that there was really nothing up there.  It was just kinda squishy.  The best that I could manage was that if I pushed forward (I have my finger in my ass and pushing on the rectum wall that's by the base of my penis), it felt like I had to pee even though I didn't have to pee. That was it.  I figured that this was the prostate (it is), but it didn't do much for me.  I repeated this exploration on a few different occasions, but that was all I felt.  There were a couple of times when I decided to concentrate on pushing on my prostate (good move), but my fingers were only  long enough that I was kinda glancing across it and couldn't do any prolonged stimulation.  I felt like this was the right direction for getting anal pleasure (I was right), but I also realized that I needed something else to stick up there in order to get any prolonged stimulation.  It was at this point that I found out that there was really nothing safely dildo-shaped in my entire place of residence.  I ended up wrapping the handle-end of a particularly long, sturdy piece of silverware (don't worry, I made sure nobody used it afterwards) in paper towels until it was the girth of a penis, and then rolling a condom down over it in order to keep everything in place and water-tight.  Then I shoved it up my ass.  More accurately, I gently pushed it up my ass with the aid of plenty of lube.  It felt okay.  Again, just the sensation of having something pushed unto my ass wasn't groundbreaking - there really aren't very many nerves on the inside.  So I went about hitting my prostate again.  It was more clear that this was what I should be doing, but my pseudo-dildo was a bit awkward to maneuver and I didn't get much farther than thinking ""yeah, I can see how someone might enjoy this with enough patience"".  The next step was when I bit the bullet and ordered a real live dildo off of Amazon.  It came in the mail and it was a little bit curved and it flared out at the base (this is critical) and it was made of totally 100% safe medical silicone and it was slightly thinner than a real penis but about as long.  And it was purple.  I made sure to get safe water-based lube as well, so I put a condom on the dildo (safety first!), lubed it up, and pushed it into my ass.  Again, nothing really ground-breaking here.  I learned that it I pushed it in too far, it would hurt.  The main benefit of having a real dildo id that it is all in one piece and it is fairly rigid, so I had much more control and I didn't have to worry about it falling apart.  This meant that I could leave it in longer, relax with it, try moving it fast or slowly.  The main pleasure seemed to be that I could graze against the prostate while pushing in and out (or just ram it full-force into the prostate if I held it at an angle).  But I also learned that it felt kind of good just very slowly sliding the dildo in and out.  It was a feeling that I had never paid any attention to before, but it was around the rim of my asshole, and I have grown to like it even more since.  This adds some pleasure in just being penetrated, regardless of the state of your prostate.  I tried on several occasions to make myself orgasm by just ramming the dildo quickly and repeatedly into my prostate, but my arms would always get tired long before I got there.  And there was no suction cup, so I never had much success just sitting on it.  It was very clear that I was on the path to orgasm with this ramming, and the feeling was very intense, in an I-want-nothing-more-than-to-cum-right-now-but-I'm-stuck-at-this-plateau-and-can't-push-myself-over-the-edge kind of way.  So I was at this stage for a while.  Eventually I leveled up again by buying an Aneros prostate massager (Progasm Jr).  So I put it in (it slips is surprisingly easily), and again, I couldn't get any feeling out of it for a while.  After a half hour or so thing aligned so that squeezing my ass muscles would push it against my prostate.  And I found that doing this while laying face down and pushing my hips forward, kind of like very slowly humping my bed, would give me reliable,strong, repeated pressure on my prostate.  So I just keep doing this, and the feeling builds and builds and plateaus and then builds some more until I had an orgasm from prostate stimulation.  It wasn't one of those legendary Ultra-Orgasmstm , but it was definitely a prostate orgasm.  I definitely ejaculated into my underwear.  The funny thing was that, at least for the first time, it was all about the buildup and then when I started cumming it actually felt like nothing.  Like it was suddenly blissfully asexual, kind of like a wet dream.  I've done this on a few more occasions, and I also like to squirm around and get all of those rim-of-the-asshole sensations as well.  At the time of writing, I still have not yet had full-blown anal sex with another actual dude (hopefully soon), so this is as far as the narrative goes.  I just wanted to write this out because I know what you mean when you say that you didn't feel anything, and the rest of the advice is either ""guess you're just unlucky"" or ""be more horny"".  The reality is that, just like all things in sex, it's actually much more difficult and physical and nuanced than other people make it look.  Good luck to you, and may your journey be a great one."
