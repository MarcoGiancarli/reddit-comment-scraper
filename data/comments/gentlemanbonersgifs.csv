gentlemanbonersgifs,33m7ee,lightrise,5,Thu Apr 23 19:10:26 2015 UTC,It's pretty great for the occasional laugh.
gentlemanbonersgifs,33m7ee,Guys_Ranqe,58,Thu Apr 23 21:28:36 2015 UTC,"She's not even trying to hide it. The last time I did something like that a girl said ""this court order says you have to stay at least 100 feet away what part about that don't you get""  She's just playing hard to get."

gentlemanbonersgifs,33m7ee,fourthings,44,Thu Apr 23 18:28:22 2015 UTC,"Body language says she's uncomfortable, not aroused or interested, in fact I'd bet money she's enduring his bad breath, she recoils when he enunciates"
gentlemanbonersgifs,33m7ee,ispariz,14,Thu Apr 23 20:47:23 2015 UTC,"From experience, I can say she might be struggling with uncomfortable clothes/underwear, or excessive heat (lights like this can be hot as fuck), or some other combination or cause for exhaustion. Intermittent heavy chest breathing like this isn't a sign of arousal or even comfort at all..."
gentlemanbonersgifs,33m7ee,supergecko,0,Thu Apr 23 21:44:13 2015 UTC,yeah. some of the comments here make me think why rape happens more often than it should. guys don't know how to read women's body language properly...

gentlemanbonersgifs,33m7ee,fried_eagle_mind,9,Thu Apr 23 21:57:35 2015 UTC,"Man, she wants to jump his bones hard or something. Look how heavy she's breathing and restlessly moving her fingers."
gentlemanbonersgifs,33m7ee,flip69,11,Fri Apr 24 01:44:08 2015 UTC,"IF it was a guy doing to that to a woman they might just get called ""creepy""."

gentlemanbonersgifs,33h7p7,EEverest,-45,Thu Apr 23 02:16:07 2015 UTC,"Thanks for sharing, but if we all just posted Youtube video, we would be watching hours of video a day. The Gifs can make the best parts quick and easy. Just saying."
gentlemanbonersgifs,33h7p7,smitwiff,22,Wed Apr 22 15:42:08 2015 UTC,"Alternatively, if everyone posts gifs, but follows it up with a link to the pertinent video attaced to each respective gif, then those of us who want to see the video a specific gif is connected to, or actually hear any dialogue, can. A matter of having the option, as it were. Y'know."
gentlemanbonersgifs,33h7p7,skatastic57,-33,Wed Apr 22 17:23:53 2015 UTC,Then we should maybe all just use Google search :)

gentlemanbonersgifs,33h7p7,Bluenosedcoop,8,Wed Apr 22 21:21:48 2015 UTC,"Maybe we don't even need this sub then. After all, we could just google celebrities' names and find these gifs on our own.   Following up with source material in the comments doesn't detract from the sub."
gentlemanbonersgifs,33h7p7,georgito555,26,Wed Apr 22 20:41:01 2015 UTC,"Well then don't click on it, just saying"
gentlemanbonersgifs,33h7p7,Bluenosedcoop,-13,Wed Apr 22 16:26:50 2015 UTC,He was just making a point...
gentlemanbonersgifs,33h7p7,georgito555,14,Wed Apr 22 16:49:14 2015 UTC,He was making a point in a rather un-necessary passive aggressive manner.
gentlemanbonersgifs,33h7p7,Bluenosedcoop,-13,Wed Apr 22 17:02:54 2015 UTC,"No he didn't, that's just what your hearing."
gentlemanbonersgifs,33h7p7,georgito555,5,Wed Apr 22 17:07:57 2015 UTC,The downvotes tend to disagree with you.
gentlemanbonersgifs,33h7p7,BaconAndEggzz,-7,Wed Apr 22 22:39:54 2015 UTC,See now that's passive aggressive.
gentlemanbonersgifs,33h7p7,Ricktron3030,6,Thu Apr 23 01:42:32 2015 UTC,"I'm 100% sure you don't even know what passive aggressive means, Just stop when you're down, You're clearly in the wrong and every sensible person would realise it."
