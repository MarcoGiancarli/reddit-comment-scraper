Do a test on a less sensitive area of skin first (back of arm/leg, etc.) where if it reacts badly no one will see. If your test is successful, then proceed. If it fails, then consider something else. I used a latex-based substance for cosplay scars and it held up pretty well, so if collodion doesn't work you could consider that."

I have a con this weekend that Id like to test everything out in, then next weekend is our Comic Con so I'd like to have everything done by then.   Â   The visor I looked EVERYWHERE for tint to apply myself couldnt find anything. I just bought a paintball mask lens with the tint on it. I was able to find silver self applying reflective tint but from the reviews is very hard to apply on your own smoothly.  Â   Since the shape is so similar the paintball mask worked. Even for the other characters, you can build a foam overlay to scale down the size without ruining the lens."

Many people use EVA foam in place of thermoplastics because it is more affordable. I'm assuming by ""white spandex suit"" you mean a zentai suit, which run around ~$30, (in my experience making a Zero Suit, making it can cost more than buying because of multiple fittings). As far as sewing or painting purple goes, I used applique on my Zero Suit, but I have seen other people paint their Zentai suits."

cosplay,3dyh63,puella-magica,2,Mon Jul 20 15:49:26 2015 UTC,"Since you're going for Madoka, I'm guessing you don't mind wearing wigs? With wigs, you're not limited to blonde female characters. You don't even have to be limited to female characters. It's hard to give suggestions without knowing your interests. Cosplay someone from your favorite show; not the most helpful advice, but it's true. Since it's your first convention, maybe choose someone from a less popular anime/manga/game or someone not often cosplayed if you want to stand out with your cosplay. Or alternatively, choose someone from a popular series and make it amazing! It's just all up to your budget, your experience on making/buying/finding cosplays. Don't limit yourself :) But if you want suggestions for blonde anime characters, Winry or Olivier Armstrong from Fullmetal Alchemist are the ones I can think of off the top of my head. You could also try: https://www.animecharactersdatabase.com/"
cosplay,3dyh63,Potaytos,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:27:21 2015 UTC,Thank you so much for your reply! And yes I don't mind getting a wig. I am not worried about budget (as long as its not to expensive). I want to be Madoka on the last episode but I would have to try and find the cosplay. I did use the animecharacterdatabase and I came across a game i use to play called hyperdimension neptunia. I want to be purple heart. Do you think I could pull it off?
cosplay,3dyh63,Potaytos,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:33:41 2015 UTC,"It might be hard making the suit since it's stretchy, but go for it! You could probably start by modifying a swimsuit or bodysuit if you don't want to sew it from scratch. If you're buying it, good luck. Try and ask around for reputable sellers since a lot of sellers will take cosplayer's photos and use it for their product. I typically buy parts from Taobao, since I have connections in China, but even then, I sometimes end up with something bad. For the wig, consider getting the pigtails as attachments and not getting a long wig and then braiding it.   You could really pull off anything you want; it really depends on how accurate you insist on being. Just be confident. For example, I'm a woman about your size and age, but I'm working on cosplaying Trundle from League of Legends. x)"

So I'm not going to take my good fortune for granted and I will ride the happy wave while it lasts, stay humble, help others when I can, and if the bottom falls out someday then at least I know that good times are possible and good memories are mine to keep forever;)"

cosplay,3drt01,Djlynch2009,22,Sat Jul 18 21:02:31 2015 UTC,That is dangerously close to being a gimp suit.
cosplay,3drt01,TenuredOracle,12,Sun Jul 19 01:56:07 2015 UTC,"I'm 99% sure that is a gimp suit. Unless I'm mistaken, that's latex right there. If it weren't for the knives and the helmet, it'd be bonafide gimpy."
cosplay,3drt01,SupaKoopa714,7,Sun Jul 19 03:24:36 2015 UTC,That's great. Where can I get this costume...  y'know...  for cosplay reasons...
cosplay,3drt01,thiefx,5,Sun Jul 19 05:37:36 2015 UTC,Hot as fuck!......literally
cosplay,3drt01,Antique_Acid_666,3,Sun Jul 19 05:33:14 2015 UTC,I saw this guy at Dragon Con and he got tired of being called the wrong super villain names and had business cards printed out saying all the things he was NOT on the back and Black Manta enemy of Aquaman on the front with his symbol.

cosplay,3dwc9q,PENNYDIM_,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:03:48 2015 UTC,"For armor I've made in the past, and for what my friends have done as well, we all used elastic straps and nylon webbing combined with various buckles and D-rings. Here is a good website for various buckles that I used in the past.  I would suggest link surfing the shit out of that site, and using some of the products to help you brain storm.   Also, Youtube has some good armor strapping tutorials as well.  Also, FYI, I made some fiberglass armor and nylon webbing works well with hot glue to adhere to itself, but not fiberglass. I had to resort to gorilla glue to attach the nylon webbing (straps) to the fiberglass armor. I only mention that because many pepakura builders use fiberglass over it. Just thought it'd be helpful to know. Good luck!"

cosplay,3dt41w,super_cached,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:46:28 2015 UTC,"I bought this cast. It was the most accurate one and the price is right! I really want to sell this one and purchase the one Volpin Props makes, its stellar but 300$ :("
cosplay,3dt41w,wingchild,-1,Mon Jul 20 04:54:48 2015 UTC,"I've noticed Daft Punk cosplay showing up at various cons over the last few years - so if you don't mind the question, why that cosplay at an Anime con?   Has it become a general rule that folks just cosplay whatever, whenever? (It certainly would explain the prevalence of ""steampunk"" ""cosplay"" at Otakon.)"
cosplay,3dua6m,Samsara19,1 point,Sun Jul 19 15:18:48 2015 UTC,For the original tunic and cape I'd say go with burlap. This looks more flowy though. You might have to hit up a fabric store and see what they have.
cosplay,3duj1v,McDuffBSmith,3,Sun Jul 19 16:42:10 2015 UTC,"What are you looking for advice wise? Like, do you need makeup advice or are you concerned that you wont look very feminine in costume?"
cosplay,3duj1v,orionegg,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:14:29 2015 UTC,"Bear with me, I'm not sure how to word this. I'm worried that if I wear a skintight plugsuit my junk will bulge and my manboobs won't be big enough. So yes it is the costume (no I actually dont have manboobs). How would I make/where would I buy a red plugsuit that's more... Male oriented?"
cosplay,3duj1v,psychan,3,Sun Jul 19 17:28:07 2015 UTC,"So you're looking to genderbend or crossplay? Genderbending involved changing the characters gender; cross playing involves changing your's. Either way, you'll have to decide how much work you're willing to do for this project."
cosplay,3duj1v,wingchild,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:41:59 2015 UTC,"Well, now I know the difference. Thank you. I guess genderbend. Makes it easier right? I've scoured the interwebs and can't find Asuka's plugsuit for a guy."
cosplay,3duj1v,psychan,2,Sun Jul 19 17:58:45 2015 UTC,"Male ballet dancers deal with the bulge by way of a dance belt. Something similar might help smooth things out, presuming you want the focus on the suit and not on your package."

cosplay,3dss52,CheeseSharp,1 point,Sun Jul 19 08:27:24 2015 UTC,Checkout http://www.evike.com/. Its a company that sells equipment for airsoft tournaments / encounters. They sell everything from pistols to body armor and all at relatively decent prices.  Look for a brand called Matrix (yeah i know cheesy name). But they actually have some options that I have seen used for Red Hood or for Deathstroke cosplays. Like this or this.
