Minecraft,3dy388,chaddercheez,11,Mon Jul 20 15:26:12 2015 UTC,"But they didn't start saying anything about 1.9 right after 1.8. You can't start the countdown clock of the next update IMMEDIATELY after a previous one is released, because it is natural for the team to take a break. They didn't start teasing 1.9 for months after 1.8. And on top of that, they were being acquired by Microsoft at the time, which was obviously a lot to work through and probably distracted time from development."
Minecraft,3dy388,Mr_Simba,4,Mon Jul 20 15:32:15 2015 UTC,"2 months that's the time between 1.7 and the first 1.8 snapshot.

There is always something going on and professionals can work through such things and not use them as an excuse to not get things done. Minecon lasted 2 days and they were working on things up until they left for Minecon. As far as Microsoft buying them goes, are you telling me they stopped working on all minecraft related things during that transition? Must have been hard for them to justify their paychecks for those months during the transition then."

Minecraft,3dxi3r,Magib1,60,Mon Jul 20 10:15:12 2015 UTC,"I've added in basic scrolling/movement to my Pokemon Red recreation.  A brief explanation of what's happening:  All of the background textures are custom maps.  In the spawn chunks there is a (very large) physical representation of the entire Pokemon Red overworld, with each block corresponding to a separate map texture.  An armor stand moves along this physical map and, whenever the tries to move (by using inventory slots rebound to arrow keys) the blocks for the newly loaded maps are cloned behind the map display.  The item frames loading the new tiles then ""read"" the block type and display the appropriate map, and the remaining frames get shifted up/down/left/right by a block.  In order to store easily accessible information I'm also creating a sort of physical database underneath the block map.  For example, the first layer under the map represents whether the block can be walked on or not (green wool = yes, red wool = no).  Separate levels with this type of binary information can be created for doorways, surfable tiles, signs, etc.  This cuts down on the command blocks needed, as lag is a very serious concern for the map.  Image of the physical map: http://i.imgur.com/eyB7O9U.png  The textures in that map don't serve any purpose aside from assisting me in creating the map in-game.  I can include them in the final map as an optional download, but they don't serve any functional purpose.  Let me know if you have any questions!"

Minecraft,3dxi3r,Survivorchristhe2nd,41,Mon Jul 20 16:21:53 2015 UTC,No armor stands for the map interface itself - item frames are entities so you actually don't need to tie them to another entity to enable executes.  Plus item frames do not play well with other entities (unfortunately).  I do have the basics for the chat overlay set up and that uses blocks on the heads of armor stands for the characters since there are way too many possible permutations to use maps.

The goal is to have this mimic the actual Pokemon Red game as much as possible.
Minecraft,3dxi3r,EpikYummeh,3,Mon Jul 20 21:22:11 2015 UTC,INB4 Minecraft plays Pokemon in one command :D
Minecraft,3dxi3r,Kl0udy,2,Mon Jul 20 17:22:39 2015 UTC,This would not be possible in 1 command. A world download is required.

Minecraft,3dxi3r,EpicLegendX,4,Mon Jul 20 19:06:19 2015 UTC,Nice work man. I've been working on a similar project. I actually got a working and playable gameboy emulator working in Minecraft. It uses the spigot api. https://youtu.be/ELIKHeGHwGk?t=56s

Minecraft,3dxi3r,bohroldheeur,-7,Mon Jul 20 15:33:41 2015 UTC,Think of how many command blocks will be needed for fighting.
Minecraft,3dxi3r,skeddles,11,Mon Jul 20 17:51:32 2015 UTC,I have to say I'm quite looking forward to that challenge.  Though the most tedious part will definitely be adding all of the text.  That game has WAY more text than I realized when starting the project ; )
