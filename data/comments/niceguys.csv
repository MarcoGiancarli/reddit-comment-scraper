This is the person who'd talk about how good they'd treat their partner if they had one, but then rant about how all other gender are evil or cheaters, despite never having been cheated on. There's also a bit of anger towards their perceived rivals, and they'll always pronounce they're one of the ""good"" ones. Getting sucked into an echo chamber or cult or believing that real life works like television or videogames or memes is a dangerous prospect.  The ones that do develop because of an actual experience are the ones who have been told that investing all their time in the person of interest will get them results, and when that doesn't happen rage is usually the end result. It is not completely their fault that they've been engrained with these expectations, but how they react to that is.  Socially awkward but well meaning person isn't the same as Nice Person.  And I think it's always been around, we just didn't have the instant terminology, jokes, or memes that we do now. Heck just a few days ago someone posted a Victorian England example of a Nice Guy, he just wasn't called that.  I can't comment on the book in question, never read it. I don't think it's a lack of positive male role models though or toxic anything. There are plenty of outstanding guys out there, who don't have to be abrasive to be assertive. ""Feminism"" or ""Toxic Masculinity"" or whatever people are blaming for their problems is not the reason there are Nice People (and the reason I'm saying Nice People is because there can definitely be Nice Girls).  I was a Nice Person, even though I've never been interested in relationships, because for a while I was annoyed by drama from my own gender and thought that I was ""one of the good ones."" Of course, really, the whole time I was an utter creep and vicious nasty bastard. It wasn't until I got into an abusive and manipulative friendship with someone who had similar ideas that I finally woke the hell up. I'm still a jerk, I admit, but I no longer carry all that into my personal life, so I think that's progress."
niceguys,3e2tj3,Bytemite,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:34:12 2015 UTC,"Regarding the book, it's not 'toxic masculinity', but toxic shame, created by a childhood of negligent parenting (intentional or not) that leads to covert contracts - the 'sex tokens' people on here so often ridicule, wherein unstated expectations are created through no fault of the child. It's nothing to do with abrasiveness or assertiveness.   The most important question yet to be answered: why do nice guys develop? It can't be random chance, considering the largely similar life stories of nice guys, and it's unlikely to be innate since not everyone is a nice guy, suggesting some externality creating the misunderstandings."
niceguys,3e2tj3,Bytemite,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:03:05 2015 UTC,"Nah, it's not parenting, they can come from all patenting types. Nowadays its perpetuated social myths and stories like I said. People who think movies and video games or books represent real life. They also lack the social experience to recognize what are and aren't realistic expectations, which is why some of them grow out of it.  I'll give you there might be some overlap with insecure or avoidant attachment styles, but I've always thought those were a bit limited in describing how a persons perception of themselves and relationships with others can change over time depending on their experiences. It pins it on the parents when there are other formative attachments a kid might make in their lives. It's also way too easy to blame this kinda stuff on parenting so people don't have to look into their own shortcomings.  ""I'm like this because my parents did this to me"" is kind of a lateral move in terms of personal growth and analysis from ""I'm like this because other gender did this to me."" Ultimately they're like this because they believed their persistence would eventually pay off in terms of affection, even when that persistence became a turn off to the other person, because other people and the media in their lives told them it would. That's the opposite of a reaction we'd expect from someone with a neglectful childhood, who begin to pull away attachment-wise and verbalize their needs less because their needs weren't met. This all points squarely to a choice they made."
niceguys,3e2tj3,rabidkiwi13,2,Tue Jul 21 18:12:51 2015 UTC,"Yeah parenting isn't always a way to prevent this sort of behavior, I know a guy with parents who are the sweetest people I know, and over the years the son, who is an alright guy in other regards has become more and more of a creep towards women as time goes on"
niceguys,3e2tj3,Bytemite,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:06:25 2015 UTC,"But the issue is that all those things do represent real life. They're all created by people, with normal people problems, and normal people motivations and wishes. Some are more fantastical than others, of course, but we still teach morals using fairy tales and fables, which also appear to contribute to the nice guy delusion (be good and kind and loving, do favors for the girl and shower her with attention/love and she will fall in love with you). To say that these aren't representations of real life is to say that no book, movie, or video game is a representation of real life.   Ultimately they're like this because they believed their persistence would eventually pay off in terms of affection, even when that persistence became a turn off to the other person, because other people and the media in their lives told them it would. That's the opposite of a reaction we'd expect from someone with a neglectful childhood, who begin to pull away attachment-wise and verbalize their needs less because their needs weren't met.

Ultimately they're like this because they believed their persistence would eventually pay off in terms of affection, even when that persistence became a turn off to the other person, because other people and the media in their lives told them it would.

I'm just saying that way too many people grow up expecting the hollywood ending. There are real life issues that are commented on, but how they are resolved or addressed isn't necessarily realistic.   but the part after it contradicts.   Not at all. I'm saying that while there are some coping mechanisms Nice People have in common with insecure/avoidant attachment styles, you can't put this behaviour down to the exact same causes and that it manifests in different ways.  A neglected child has a anxious push-away reaction to an attachment figure, while still feeling drawn to the figure for attention. Nice People latch on to a person like a lifeline and refuse to let go, and try to shower them with attention to try to get affection back. Then when they don't get that attention, they lash out. It's very different.  We weirdly see Nice Person behaviour in people we would consider insecure in most cases, but the one thing they all seem to be secure about is that they'll get their person of interest in the end. Part of why they get so angry and shocked and aggressive and turn so bitter when this doesn't work is that they weren't expecting their efforts to fail. They believed that the investment of their time and effort entitled them to the person romantically. It's a lack of experience, reinforced by stories and social expectations."
niceguys,3e2tj3,Bytemite,2,Tue Jul 21 19:00:52 2015 UTC,"I like the tying it into attachment issues – I'm a huge fan of the book Attached. I am the sort of woman who actually has dated ""nice guys."" I was so hugely insecure and anxious that I fell for their attempts to be ""nice"" (which were often really entitled and/or controlling).   I think these relationships are often so toxic that they either end up with the ""nice guy"" realizing his faults and making an effort to change or just getting worse (and dismissing the relationship issues by saying women are ""crazy"").   I do think parenting does have at least something to do with it. Most of these men I dated before I realized my issues came from broken families and had no role models for healthy relationships."

It offers very general easy tips for self-improvement, and claims it's the only philosophy out there offering that (it's not). Once you've invested in the self-improvement aspect and have seen some results that way, that's when they can start getting people to buy into the more extreme parts of the the philosophy.  Scientology also does this. First they offer self-improvement, then they do ""audits"" going over the person's bad behaviour, supposedly to help self-improvement, but really just to create self-doubts and shame (the self-hating ""beta"" males). Then, when the victims are locked in that vicious cycle, desperate for a way out, the drop the thetans on them.   The red pill version of thetans is the 1950s gender role evo psych stuff, dread game, and last minute resistance. It is actually quite misogynistic and also misandrist too. All guys are either ""alpha"" or ""beta"" and ""beta"" guys and ""blue pillers"" haven't been awakened yet and won't ever be successful? Super misandrist.

These games are very linear and focused on telling a story or showing spectacular (cut-) scenes, rather than gameplay or challenging the player. Hence, they often have regenerating health and plenty of guides towards the next scene. Oftentimes, these games are extremely easy. The player does not have to perform well to win, because the NPC-allies win combats on their own, while the player can hardly die at all. Mistakes of the ""player"" are not supposed to disturb the flow of the story.  Since Spunkgargleweewees are more focused on linear storytelling than on gameplay, they could also be defined as interactive (action) movies.  The term was coined by Ben ""Yahtzee"" Croshaw in his zero-punctuation review of ""Medal of Honor Warfighter"".     Call of Duty is a Spunkgargleweewee.

It's hard to know for sure what role nature and nurture play in the development of personality, but nurture definitely plays a role in people learning how to interact with other people, and in the Nice Guy case, it plays a role in developing this ineffective model for relating to women.  And the way kids are nurtured has changed over time.  It used to be that boys would go work with their fathers in the field when they were old enough. Now fathers go off to work in the morning, come home in the evening, and for most of the time in between boys are raised by female caregivers, either their mothers or daycare workers or the largely female teaching profession.  And the lesson boys learn from their female caregivers about relating to women is that if you're a good boy she'll give you praise and maybe a cookie or some other reward.  And for the Nice Guy he is stuck in that model. Be a good boy and she will give you a reward. That's his understanding of how to relate to women. He didn't transition to more adult models of how to relate to women.  And maybe the reason is that he didn't have men in his life to learn from."

There are many other factors, but this makes sense.  Parents having lack of time for kids generally makes them pretty incompatible with the normally functioning society. And then when kids enter puberty, they just lock themselves at home and ""live"" on the internet, because you don't have to face day to day adversity (you should already be prepared for) there. And parents are almost happy with it, because they don't need to deal with their children.   The detachment from society is in my opinion the biggest driver of nice guy mentality.

I'm not a feminist activist or anything, or even a woman, but from my small knowledge these are things that I could come up with off the top of my head.  If you think feminists have nothing left to fight for, well, that attitude is one of the struggles that modern feminists have.  The attitude of ""well they got the vote and we don't get to hit them anymore, what more do they want?"" is sadly common."
niceguys,3dx5bc,apinigis,9,Mon Jul 20 17:10:44 2015 UTC,"How about movies passing the Bechdel test?   I personally dislike the Bechdel test because it fails to take the the context of the setting into account.  I prefer the Mako Mori test, which requires a movie to    have at least one female character; who gets her own narrative arc; that is not about supporting a man's story"
niceguys,3dx5bc,krakow056,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:32:15 2015 UTC,"I've never heard of this one.  Without hearing the whole argument behind why the Mako Mori test is better, I think the Bechdel test still has a place.  Sure, if a movie has a very limited cast or has a natural context that might have very few women (a war movie, eg), then that one makes sense, but I think part of the problem with Hollywood is that it's kind of just the default for men to be the main characters.  If the movies we watch were taking place in the real world, half of the characters would be female, but that kind of representation doesn't seem to make it to the screen."
niceguys,3dx5bc,apinigis,-12,Mon Jul 20 20:50:09 2015 UTC,"good lord that bechdel test is the most stupid thing that ever was.   http://www.imdb.com/chart/top  A lot of those 'fail' the test. So what does this prove? That you don't need movies to pass the test in order to have a good movie.  women want more movies where women have prominent roles? then do more movies instead of asking men to do it for you  the hollywood age gap comes not from some crazy conspiracy, but it's about the age man and women are valued in hollywood: almost ALL best actress winners were under 30 and almost all (except for adrian brody) were over 30. So what do you do? You pair actress+actor at their peak markeability.   You gave 2 examples of made up problems."
niceguys,3dx5bc,krakow056,4,Mon Jul 20 18:36:47 2015 UTC,"Judging by your post history, it seems like you may be a troll.  That's fine if you are, but on the off chance you're just ignorant, let me show you why that's a bad argument.  If your argument is that a movie doesn't have to pass the Bechdel test to be good, I'm not disagreeing.  I love most of the films on that list.  Does that change the fact that it kinda sucks to have most movies be made about men?  All women want is to have more movies made about women, who I'm sure you'll agree, can be interesting people aside from their romantic interests in men!   women want more movies where women have prominent roles? then do more movies instead of asking men to do it for you   This is pretty naive if not deliberately disingenuous.  There are lots of female directors out there who would love to do exactly what you're suggesting.  The problem is getting hired.  If you think that women are just inferior directors to men and Hollywood knows they just won't do as good a job with movies if they're given them, then I would suggest you examine your beliefs about women.     almost ALL best actress winners were under 30 and almost all (except for adrian brody) were over 30.   This is just factually wrong.  Only 30 of the 88 Academy Award Winners for Best actress were under 30.  10 of them were over 50.    Also, what you're saying is a direct result of the Hollywood age gap, not an example of why it doesn't exist.  I'm not suggesting it comes from a conspiracy, but from a belief that audiences won't go see a movie where a 50-year-old George Clooney woos a 50-year-old Sandra Bullock, so they need to have him dating someone 20 years younger than him.  The fact that Best Actor winners are, on average, older has nothing to do with acting talent and everything to do with the fact that, in our culture, women are seen as less valuable as actors if they are not young, while men are seen as valuable actors regardless of age.  Casting and marketability do not occur in a vacuum; they are direct results of our values of a culture.  Feminists want to change that culture so that men are viewed as just as valuable as men, regardless of their age."
niceguys,3dx5bc,apinigis,0,Mon Jul 20 21:20:10 2015 UTC,"Does that change the fact that it kinda sucks to have most movies be made about men?   Most movies are written, produced, directed by man. Are you asking for handouts?  But most important of all: most interesting stories in the real world are lived by men!   Lets go back to the top 250 (I'm commenting about movies based or with basis on real life, not fantasy or scifi ec):   The Shawshank Redemption: think about just about every interesting prison scape in the real world that has ever ocurred. All made by men. The Godfather: yeah, woman had a maternal role in the real mafia, but most of the real action revolved around men. Schindler's list: schindler had a penis if I recall Shichinin no samurai: would you rather see a lame ass movie about gueixas? Saving Private Ryan: would you rather see a whole movie about the women right the sympathy letters?  The Pianist: a dude Gladiator: dudes, some women Dr. Strangelove: apart from some calculations stuff, most people working on developing the bomb were man   The Great Dictator: you won't see a movie about someone parodying Angela Merkel   Paths of Glory: war = men Citizen Kane: based on a real life male billionaire. A movie about Oprah would be some soap opera lameness level. M: the real vampire of dusseldorf was a man Reservoir Dogs: hitmen Braveheart: they were dresses, but with dicks under it  Lawrence of Arabia Full Metal Jacket: war Amadeus Inglourious Basterds: war Scarface: kings of drug traffic in Miami, not queens Raging Bull The Elephant Man The Wolf of Wall Street V for Vendetta: Guy Fawckes Judgment at Nuremberg A Beautiful Mind Into the wild Rush Hotel Rwanda 12 years a slave. Ghandi La battaglia di Algeri The Imitation Game The King's Speech   Just about every movie that's either straight from history or based on history are about men.  There are zero movies based on real life events with women in prominent roles in there.   You think it's the evil man that make movies fault that there aren't as many? Here's a thought experiment for you: for every movie I listed, try thinking about a real life women centered counterpart movie that could have been. You don't be able to.  You want more movies with women in good roles? Start doing more interesting shit. Throughout history women have had merely auxiliary/minor roles in interesting stories, and that's not just men's fault."
niceguys,3dx5bc,1randomguy,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:14:30 2015 UTC,"I don't think you read anything I said.  Wanting qualified women to get directors' jobs is literally the opposite of a handout.  Additionally, if you think that only men have led interesting lives all throughout history, you're either dumber or more sexist than you sound, which would be quite a trick.  And finally, even if it were the case that only men had ever done interesting things before, that's a problem, and not a made-up one that feminists invented to bring men down.  Maybe some movies about capable women doing interesting shit might change perceptions about what women are capable of doing and give more women opportunities to do the things they are just as capable as men of doing."

For an ideology that claims to be about nurturing positive sexual attitudes for men, it sure likes to spread negative sexual attitudes for men, ones that play on male insecurities about their own sexuality and self-worth as a sexual partner.

niceguys,3dylc4,ogg33,5,Tue Jul 21 02:50:08 2015 UTC,"what I don't understand is your definition of promiscuity   It doesn't really matter what my definition is. Everybody is going to have their own definition, and it's mostly going to be quite arbitrary from person to person. My point is that everybody is free to set their own standards, and everybody is free to make decisions about the relationships they choose to have, based upon those standards.  If there was a scale with 'promiscuity' and one end, and 'chastity' at the other, even though this is somewhat over-simplified, everybody is going to have their own unique standards and values that fit somewhere more or less along that scale. You shouldn't try to force somebody to accept your own values as being 'correct' or 'the truth'. This is what usually happens in situations where people are 'slut shaming' (which I agree is a bad thing), but for exactly the same reason, you shouldn't try to shame somebody for having less liberal values.  When people form relationships with each other, whether their work relationships, friendships, or intimate relationships. One of the most important things to determine the success of the relationships is compatibility. If you determine your values to be incompatible with with somebody else, then you're not saying that their values are wrong, or that your's are right, simply that they're not what you're looking for. If you want people to live harmoniously with each other, and show tolerance to their differences, then this idea should be just fine with you."

niceguys,3dut7o,IAmASquishyBunny,87,Sun Jul 19 20:00:43 2015 UTC,Yes it is victim blaming because this woman never fucking asked to be abused. People can easily hide who they really are to people they just meet and lure them into a false sense of security. That's exactly what abusers do. How the hell is it the victims fault for being manipulated by lies and deceit? And it's not as easy as leaving because abusers often go to extreme measures to make sure their victim doesn't leave.  Fucking christ how is this so hard to grasp?
niceguys,3dut7o,Zzjanebee,46,Sun Jul 19 20:08:27 2015 UTC,"I think people refuse to admit the world is sunshine and rainbows. That, or they've never actually experienced any form of hardship. Probably because someone was there to fix their problems for them. They have no understanding that people can be manipulative, that there are cruel people out in the world who enjoy harming others, who slowly take control over others until that person completely depends on them for any sort of self worth and thinks they deserve whatever treatment they get.   Basically it's hard to grasp if you're an emotionally stunted idiot who never learned about empathy as anything beyond a middle school vocab word."

niceguys,3dut7o,deebrie,88,Sun Jul 19 20:23:43 2015 UTC,"Hey, I used to believe that women in abusive relationships were stupid, had no self-worth, and should ""just leave""  Then I met this amazing guy. He was interesting, highly intelligent, talented, hilarious, the whole bit. We became friends, and then after a few months we became an item. I fell for him, hard. I was so passionately in love with him, I've never experienced anything like it before or since. He made me feel safe, we had a great time together, and he thought I was the best girlfriend ever.   Eighteen months in, he suffered a death in the family that effected him big time. He stopped sleeping and began drinking. Slowly, the man I loved was disappearing. He even raised his voice to me a few times, totally out of character. He would get drunk, do or say something awful to me, and then apologize in the morning (rinse repeat). I hated the way he was treating me, but he was my best friend. I couldn't abandon him when he was at his lowest point. I tried to get him help, but he always refused.   Then one night he showed up at my place unannounced, completely wasted. He was agitated and aggressive. I tried to talk to him to figure out what was going on, and he called me a worthless cunt. He was so drunk that he fell over trying to get up from the couch, and I grabbed his car keys. He became infuriated, shoved me against the wall and punched me in the face. This man is literally twice my size, so I was injured. I threw his keys at him and he left. I tried one more time to get him into rehab, but he refused. Never saw him again after that, but I struggled with tremendous guilt for leaving him alone in such a terrible state of mind.   What would you suggest for how I could have handled that differently? What did I do to bring this abuse on?"

niceguys,3dut7o,ThriftStoreSweatband,-56,Mon Jul 20 02:46:07 2015 UTC,"What you should have done was seen warning signs from the get go. You say you fell hard, which means you willingly turn a blind eye to any red flags.   You told me your side of the story, which paints you in a sympathetic light and I get that. From the sounds of it you never did anything to bring on any abuse.  Chances are he showed signs of this kind of behaviour from the beginning, or even before you met him but it was never directed at you. Perhaps you felt so safe around him because he would aggressively protect you in the same way that he turned on you.   Either way, despite him 'rinsing and repeating' his behaviour any number of times you stuck it out and let it get to a breaking point.   Your story is the textbook case of how these supposed 'Nice Guys' come to despising women like you. They see what you don't, and you get suckered into an abusive relationship. They get mad, offended and feel betrayed and become numb and bitter to the world.   They realize that in order to have Gotten a girl like you in the first place they needed to be more like him, and that destroys them on the inside. This is then compounded by being made fun of by groups like this subreddit until things spiral even more downward until Elliot Rogers 2.0 rears his head and you can all pat yourselves on the back knowing you were right all along.   Or maybe you made that whole story up to lure me out for another down vote brigade. I guess we'll see.   Edit: yup pretty sure I was lured out for down voting."
niceguys,3dut7o,amandawong,36,Sun Jul 19 23:13:09 2015 UTC,"That's the thing, he never showed aggression of any kind up until the very end. He was passive and sweet. Total nerd. The alcohol was what turned him into an abuser. I still believe that  he really is is a kind and sensitive man. He's a good man with a very bad drinking problem. A drinking problem that was totally non-existent until he suffered that loss. Never once did he become aggressive with me or anyone else around me until he started drinking to black out. The alcohol abuse only started six weeks before the incident and subsequent breakup.   What would you say to a woman (or man) who was in a committed relationship that abandoned their partner because they became depressed or experienced a trauma? Don't you believe that you should try and help people you love? He was in terrible pain and needed support more than ever. That's why I didn't leave when he started drinking. If you read what I wrote, you'll see that it ended the second he assaulted me.   What you have to understand is that there usually aren't these red flags that Nice Guys believe in. My ex wasn't especially handsome, he wasn't wealthy, he wasn't tall, and he wasn't aggressive until that incident. He's so shy, he turned bright red when I asked him out. He treated me with the utmost respect and love, until the drinking. We never even fought or argued until then.   You must believe that women are total idiots to believe what you do about abuse. You're on the wrong sub.  You can believe whatever you want. I've posted this story before."

I am sorry to hear your Ex did a complete 180° on you and I am pleased to hear you made an attempt to fix him before making the right choice and leaving him after that first hit.   I always respect the fact that there are always exceptions to the rule, but I also acknowledge that I don't have the complete story.   What is like to see from this sub is less 'poke the bear until it finally attacks' and more 'Pointing out social mistakes' in an attempt to fix 'Nice Guys' from their poor behaviour.

This isn't an exception to any rule, this is just how abuse works. Do you think abusers would be successful if they gave off huge warning signs and people knew it was coming? No one is that stupid. Abuse isn't just physical, it's also psychological as well, and a big part of that is manipulation.   It's nice for you that you've been lucky enough to never have been in that position,  but please don't put down victims of abuse. Don't make assumptions about things when you don't even know what you're talking about, and please learn that some people actually have experiences outside of your worldview."

Someone abused her, so what in the hell is she supposed to have done?    Recognize obvious warning signs, then peace out.    Do you think abusers would be successful if they gave off huge warning signs and people knew it was coming   Well they shouldn't, but in her case yes. She even says the aggressive behaviour and alcohol abuse went on repeatedly before it escalated to violence.    It's nice for you that you've been lucky enough to never have been in that position,   Yes I have, but I was a child not an adult. I never had a choice.    but please don't put down victims of abuse   Never did.    please learn that some people actually have experiences outside of your worldview.   I absolutely do. It seems some people in this discussion are unwilling to accept anything outside their world view of 'Don't blame the victim'. Does anyone feel sorry for the guy whose life turned upside down? Does anyone think he was a victim of anything as well?   At this point I am sadly forced to point out that I certainly do not condone his escalation to violence in order to not come off like I am on his side. But let's take a moment to realize he went from good to bad, and this was most likely not what we would have wanted."

You unfortunately can't go into detail about them or disclose them because that would strengthen my argument.   And yes. I am suggesting women should 'bolt' at the first sign of obvious trouble. Not put up with all the little signals and little hints that are obvious to anyone outside the relationship that build and build for days and weeks until the breaking point, Then claim victim status and admit no responsibility or accountability for their part in willingly putting themselves in that position.   You're an adult. Not some poor defenceless child who can't make smart decisions for themselves.   I am not advocating that the abuser wasn't in the wrong. Unfortunately going against the 'don't blame the victim' mentality is heavily frowned upon even if I make a strong argument.   No one seems to think Mr. 'I was a sweet guy then became an abuser' was also a victim. Why not? Did he want his relationship and life to turn into shambles?? Isn't he a victim in his own right?  Also for everyone down voting me, please keep in mind several of you are asking me follow up questions. I will be happy to respond as long as I am not blocked for 10 mins from responding. So chill.

First of all, dont try and dig up dirt on me because you don't like what I'm saying to you now. I haven't looked up your post history (nor will I) because I am focused on the NOW, I am also not desperate for anything to strengthen my argument.   Second of all, you are correct. But this is a whole different conversation with many levels that I will not side track onto.    If you bail when things get difficult, that makes you generally immature and just an asshole.   This is your opinion based on the foundation that you did the 'right' thing by sticking it out with an increasingly abusive boyfriend.   If what you say is true, I've met many girls who would fit your description of being immature assholes.    by attempting to convince me that I should be able to see the future   Wrong. I said to not ignore obvious warnings. You are dodging responsibility again. Are you telling me that if the same thing were to happen again you would let it end with another punch to the face? Or would you see the warning signs and peace out?   and that it's my fault my ex decided to drink an insane amount of alcohol and assault me.   No. Absolutely wrong. You are deliberately missing the point.   This debate it turning into the 'Feels over Reals' fallacy and I am not going to continue if everything you argue is based on emotion. This whole thing has brought up strong negative feelings on your part and this is dissolving into pointless banter.   Conclusion: if you refuse to take zero accountability for the situation you ended up in, you are admitting that if it were to happen again you would be powerless to prevent it.   I don't think you would because you know better."
niceguys,3dut7o,lekon551,14,Mon Jul 20 04:07:46 2015 UTC,"Yes, you're so incredibly logical that you believe that you have it all figured out, even though I would eat my hat if you've ever even had a girlfriend.   A logical person would recognize that almost every expert in abusive behaviors, along with real life experience, is a better bet for a realistic analysis of abusive behavior. Not an inexperienced, bitter teenager's theory he cooked up in his own brain to make himself feel better for being ignored.   I sincerely hope you get to experience a loving relationship at some point, but I can't argue with your delusion any longer.  Good luck out there."

Humans are emotional, illogical creatures by nature, and social interactions cannot be regulated by logic, as they'd end up going against social norms (I've tried it).

Starbucks coffee is bad for two reasons; keeping costs down and making all Starbucks the exact same. SBs uses low quality beans that have been roasted to hell to cover up the low-quality beans. All you taste is burnt bitterness but no rotten oily tastes that you'd get from using lightly roasted bad beans. The average coffee consumer thinks that burnt taste is just how coffee is supposed to taste, becasue low-quality beans are common for retail coffee. Also, SBs  uses these same beans in every store to ensure that the milksha--err, large iced mocha you get in California tastes the exact same as the one you buy in Minneapolis.

Originally I was going to go with the businessman, because ew beards and yay strategy games and cocaine jazz, but then I thought about it, and since the hipster obviously doesn't respect women like the nice guy does, he probably still thinks it's the man's job to pay, so all those starbuck dates that we later lie to our friends and blogs about being at the more expensive family run cafe that's somehow constantly four blocks out of our way and the free-market, french pressed, freshly ground, Death Wish cut with cinnamon coffee we drink every evening after ""supper""? It won't be me paying for them (and he'll actually know what I'm talking about).  Obviously I couldn't choose the nice guy because he's too nice and intelligent and stylish and no other reason of course (perfection is ugly to females.) The swag kid looked sweet enough, but I'd probably go to jail, so that was a no. And I suck at CoD, so dudebro was out."

I have watched the series completely about three times, and Barney really wasn't awful to Robin while they were dating or married. In fact the only reason they divorced was because Robin was too focused on her career and they never saw each other. Another thing is that Barney never actually ""disappeared"", he was at the end as well just like Marshall and Lily. At the end he was raising his daughter, and he was happy about it so he is living a good life. If you're gonna say that Barney disappeared, then so did Marshall and Lily (which they also didn't). Also sometimes people regret their choices, and Robin at the end wanted to be with Ted even right before the wedding, but he said no because he knew that she and Barney were better for each other. I get where you get your opinion from, but I don't think Ted is a ""Nice Guy TM"". I think he sucks, is annoying and makes stupid decisions, but not a Niceguy by any means."

All the same, from what I know and what you described here, I don't think there's a big ""Nice Guy"" issue that really bothers me about it. I don't think it's really a big example of sexism at all.

niceguys,3dphzm,anarkittie,32,Sat Jul 18 05:56:05 2015 UTC,"Thing is, I should have seen some signs. They were there, I just didn't pick them up. For example, he'd constantly talk badly about his ex's. Calling them whores, crazy, they lead him on, among lots of other things. I always just assumed they were what he said, ya know? That's likely not the case. He also is just honestly a delusional psychopath, or something of the sort? He was convinced his old roommate had slashed his tires, so he almost had him deported.

To this day he thinks he's the victim and all the stuff me and my friend says he did, he totally didn't do it and here's a five page essay on what really happened.  He also badmouthed every single girl he'd ever met in his life, and was obsessed with trying to find some magic combination that would make people flock to him because he was such a born leader and so intelligent and he'd change the world and so on.

If you really think of someone as being a good friend of course you're going to try and salvage things, that proves you really did value his friendship, and you were not  using him.

I haven't deleted a number since I had storage restraints on an old Nokia in 2003. I keep the numbers of even people I don't want contact with, so just know to know it's them if they call or text me. So, to me, deleting numbers is something dramatic or immature people do in rage.  So, this is just one guys opinion. I don't speak for others."

He comes over trying to cheer me up. We start hanging out and after a few weeks he kissed me. I told him I didn't want anything so soon after my relationship, but if he wanted to cuddle platonically we could do that. He said he understood but then kept getting pushy about wanting to date me. I should have explained it better. In all honesty, I'm sure I am still plenty immature, I'm only two decades old after all. I don't know much. /shrugs  And to add, he didn't say anything about other girls in these messages, but he's done this to one of my other friends recently and he always talked a lot of shit about his ex's.

It actually carries less of a stigma in my area and I had MUCH BETTER results for dating on Tinder because there were more men I found attractive with similar lifestyles. I also didn't encounter anyone offering money for sex, begging me for a date, or making me justify why I won't date men my father's age like I did on OkCupid.   I am clear I just want to get a drink and frank about not being comfortable with strange hookups and went on some very pleasant dates, yet hooked up on none. It wasn't for me because I didn't want to deal with the stress at the time and am happy with my fwb, but it works for others.  My friend in another state started using it because all her girl friends did and they all got boyfriends. Now she's been dating the fourth guy she met for a few months. We have a lot of college kids, young professionals and transplants in our cities so the pickings are pretty good for meeting people."

Also it makes it so that when girls say ""no"" boys just perceive it as the girls reacting to teasing. It gets replayed in the 'coy' girl saying no so that the boy chases. It's not exactly healthy because, eventually, some girl says no and really means it and that no isn't taken seriously because it never has been."

I started University, was really shy but a guy approached me and started talking to me and I thought...oh cool that's nice, guy must've noticed how shy I was. Anyway, he started getting quite weird quite quickly, I told him I had a partner who I'd been seeing for about 9 months at this point. So he just kinda let it slide but still would talk to me loads.  He became extremely possessive of what I was doing, where I was and who I was spending time with. If I wasn't with him...why? If I was speaking to someone else he never approved of me talking to all these 'douchebags' and I should know better. At the time I had just left therapy and counselling for some personal things so I was still a little nervous about stuff. I'd leave lessons early for some extra sessions with the counsellors there and he actually told me off for it. How dare I leave. I snatched my phone and switched it off I was ever texting anybody about...anything really.  Towards the end of the year I realised I had made barely any friends apart from him...he had complete control over everything I was doing and it was extremely distressing. I nearly dropped out of university, but I'd waits so long to go...I started hiding my posts from him on Facebook and started speaking and meeting up with other people privately. My partner felt powerless in doing anything because he was so far away doing his dissertation at the time.  Come 2nd and 3rd year he calms down a hell of a lot following an assault he suffered...I feel sorry for him but I know that he would still cling on for dear life so I did everything in my power to stay away from any group work with him.  End of third year...and it's fantastic...a long essay about how he's always fancied me. I tell him I could kind of tell from first year but I kept it back because I was just wanting to be friends the moment I met him. His response? ""well I was just physically attracted to you I never would've spoken to you if I wasnt""  11/10 would recommend this man to anybody.  Followed by how girls always tell him he's 'such a nice guy' and be knows he is so why won't girls like me give him a chance?! Well I wonder."

Sorry, just had to rant about how nonsensical this guy is."

niceguys,3dkxn7,EmreGenc,5,Fri Jul 17 06:03:41 2015 UTC,"he caught her in a moment of weakness, I guess.  That's really, really bad.  Hope she pulls out of it before the semester starts.  That's even bad in situations where you have ordinary garden-variety unrequited love, without the extra layer of NiceGuyTM douchiness.  I've been through that, liking someone who didn't like me, and they have a weak moment and they acquiesce to dating.  It's bad in so many ways -- you're not gonna say no because you like them, but you really should because you should be with someone where the attraction is equal.  Meanwhile if things progress, the other person will never fully like you or respect you because you were the safe option/plan B/whatever, and they'll always have that other person on their mind who they liked that much more and had better chemistry with.  It's gotta be a two way street or there's no f'ing point."

niceguys,3dkxn7,wreckjames,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:14:01 2015 UTC,"I understand that for those who ""haven't been lucky"" when regarding the dating world that it's a trial and error thing.  Especially when you're younger, your personality and opinions haven't fully developed(despite what you may think at the time) and you find out what works and doesn't regarding socializing(or, I guess you never do, depending on the person).  What I really don't understand is how somebody gets to this point.  How do you get to a place where you think that just by ""being nice"" or trying to buy everything for a person that it'll earn their love and admiration?  I'd assume with most of these stories that they were involving kids of high school age, but so many of them are during college and even post-college that my assumption becomes null.    Also, to the OP: awesome handle."

niceguys,3df6uo,CambianK,4,Thu Jul 16 04:56:57 2015 UTC,Yeah but that's too much work for them.  They'd rather bitch and place blame somewhere else.

Any of those things on their own, or maybe just 1-3 at a time aren't necessarily bad things. But all together? Dear lord, and that's just the stupid sidebar. What woman in her right mind would go out with this guy? Add in the weird entitled attitude and you have a shitshow waiting to happen."

niceguys,3dflyx,MasterPlant,6,Thu Jul 16 09:03:45 2015 UTC,"atinyradish said 'entitled attitude', meaning he thinks he is entitled and acts that way, not that he is entitled.  but even so, there is usually a lot of alignment with entitlement and acting entitled, or 'self-entitled' as you put it. it's hard to create a person that feels they have a right to everything and deserve whatever they want if that's not how they've been treated generally. not always, but a lot of the time."

The taller you are - the more muscle mass you'll have to add to your body for people to notice - and he's 1.93m (6'4''). I've spent enough time in /r/gainit to know how hard it is for tall fellas.  That being said - I can bet my right nut he never lifted, exercised оr followed a strict diet for more than a week. A self-entitled person like that would definitely say so if he practiced anything seriously. My guess is he since he's not fat he entered an athletic body type."

niceguys,3dehc3,ducatimechanic,148,Wed Jul 15 17:15:43 2015 UTC,This is why I'm fucking nervous when creepy guys confess their feelings for me. I don't know if rejecting them is gonna be my death sentence (or even someone else's).

niceguys,3dehc3,CambianK,18,Thu Jul 16 16:36:11 2015 UTC,"for me the creepyness usually comes from not respecting my boundaries. i.e. touching me or my stuff when i don't know the person on that level yet, saying sexual things at an early point in the friendship or acting jealous when i talk about other friends, etc.  if a friend of mine would tell me he has a crush on me or is interested in more than a friendship this in itself is not a problem. the problem arises if i react in any way but enthusiastic about it and he keeps on persisting and making hints about it.  i'm obviously not this girl you like but i think if you are mindful of her boundaries and comfort level you should be fine."

That said, ""beta"" is still technically not a thing.  Maybe shy socially awkward guys trying to engage outgoing and not-shy girls as their maniac pixie dream girl wives to be might lose them to more outgoing guys, in which case reality does not often live up to the bullshit hollywood or anime stories. Shy approaching shy tends to have better results. This still does not suggest that certain personality traits of human beings somehow classify them as second class citizens.   Since it's an appellate that tends to be assigned to men with certain personality traits, it's misandrist as anything else that gets lobbed at guys in this day and age.

niceguys,3df4tb,robot267,15,Thu Jul 16 18:56:38 2015 UTC,Number 18 was like watching 50 train wrecks at once
niceguys,3df4tb,throwawaytc123,11,Wed Jul 15 20:30:43 2015 UTC,I want to impregnate you and marry you   I don't think I've cringed so hard in ages
niceguys,3df4tb,10art1,12,Wed Jul 15 20:56:45 2015 UTC,"Impregnate and then marry her?  Tsk tsk, everyone knows a TRUE chivalrous supreme gentleman Nice Guy would wait until marriage to lay with his feeeeemale."
niceguys,3df4tb,throwawaytc123,15,Wed Jul 15 21:02:12 2015 UTC,Seriously hate the fact that they needed six pages to make a list of 20.
niceguys,3df4tb,AbsorbEverything,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:12:32 2015 UTC,At least it wasn't 20 pages
niceguys,3df4tb,ArtSchnurple,9,Thu Jul 16 18:45:46 2015 UTC,"Can anybody explain to me what's wrong with answering ""thanks"" to a compliment please?"
niceguys,3df4tb,Onechordbassist,2,Thu Jul 16 08:15:15 2015 UTC,"Well, duh. You're supposed to respond as effusively as the Nice Guy.   Oh gosh, thank you. You're so wonderful. No one has ever complimented me like that before. You're the best. Here, have my undying love and my vagina. /s"
niceguys,3df4tb,Harbingerofmeh,3,Thu Jul 16 13:46:35 2015 UTC,"That feels kinda wrong, but maybe that's just me."
niceguys,3df4tb,Onechordbassist,5,Thu Jul 16 15:20:49 2015 UTC,Ha. I know some of those redditors and those posts. Dear old /r/creepypms.
niceguys,3df4tb,FixinThePlanet,4,Wed Jul 15 23:39:38 2015 UTC,"Oh no, I read this to my fiancé and we both laughed so hard we cried. Can't get over the guy who thought that a girl was interested if she hadn't blocked him or deleted her Facebook account. That girl owned him."
niceguys,3df4tb,ventimus,4,Thu Jul 16 01:10:13 2015 UTC,"What is it with these fools and the smiles seductively faggotry? Don't they realize that nobody likes that nonsense and doing it may actually cause your testicles to retract into your body cavity, making a loud slurping noise as it goes? Trust me, this is science."
niceguys,3df4tb,wilson_rawls,3,Thu Jul 16 01:34:10 2015 UTC,"It's kind of like reading through a ""Nice Guys"" hall of fame"
niceguys,3df4tb,DCEnigma,3,Wed Jul 15 23:05:05 2015 UTC,Grow a pear... Pfft
niceguys,3df4tb,m205,3,Thu Jul 16 00:54:43 2015 UTC,"The image of a guy being friendzoned by a pear farmer who obviously prefers their own company (on the pear farm, presumably) is so funny to me."
niceguys,3df4tb,m205,2,Thu Jul 16 00:56:09 2015 UTC,I can't even finish looking at these. U
niceguys,3df4tb,eatyourmakeup1,2,Thu Jul 16 03:50:32 2015 UTC,Plot twist: The girl in 16 is actually talking about her cat.
niceguys,3df4tb,Onechordbassist,2,Thu Jul 16 08:22:00 2015 UTC,"Just to be clear the world isn't about you women females. When we give you a compliment, say we'll treat you with respect, buy you gifts, or even say good night we're making a purchase. We deserve your attention and sex because we bothered to put the effort into talking to you. But we all know feminism was just invented so ""low value"" women can get a man. And because of this it prevents us Nice Guys™ from getting a date with all of those perfect 10 models that used to throw themselves at our feet in gratitude.   Wait a minute all of this shit is contradictory. Nice Guys™ are full of shit you say? Well then I guess I had better move on over to the red pill station and fill up on misogyny so I can finally get laid!"
niceguys,3df4tb,chalicehalffull,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:04:54 2015 UTC,i cant tell if this is sarcasm or not.
niceguys,3df4tb,chalicehalffull,1 point,Fri Jul 17 23:41:49 2015 UTC,It is. I've read too many of these posts.
