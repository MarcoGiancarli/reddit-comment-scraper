Dreams,3e3mhv,divinedmind,4,Tue Jul 21 18:24:05 2015 UTC,This strikes me as a dream about awakening archetypal energy in yourself. In the image of the sword you see the potential you have to do great things and fulfill your potential as a spiritual being. In the demon you see an image of the part of yourself that must be mastered before you have access to this great inner power. That's my guess.  Kalki is also the name of the avatar that comes at the end of the Age of Iron to destroy the forces of decay and begin a new age of Enlightenment. It's similar the Second Coming stories found in Christianity and Islam. Link.  I take it you hadn't heard of the Kalki before it was referred to in your dream? Most Westerners haven't heard of it.
Dreams,3e3mhv,RadOwl,3,Tue Jul 21 20:36:29 2015 UTC,"Very interesting interpretation.  When I think about it, I can see how parts of my dream may reflect how my subconscious feels at this point in time. Going into Hell.  Confronting a demon.  Retrieving an artifact and discovering it has great power.    Living in poverty.  Understanding the world and as many of its complexities as possible.  Articulating knowledge into a usable form and using that to impact the world.  It's a bit surreal, but who's to say what dreams really mean.  I thank you for your input."
Dreams,3e3mhv,RadOwl,3,Tue Jul 21 22:25:55 2015 UTC,What a great way of connecting the elements and components of the dream with your life. Dreams take what is going on in your life and turn it into story form. Overall it seems like a really positive dream. Keep up the good work!

Dreams,3e3s9r,Zallkar,2,Tue Jul 21 23:07:44 2015 UTC,"It seems to point to a transformation story. The question is how you feel/felt about it. You did something and didn't like you've become. Or that something you did changed you for the better. Or even that you hunger for such a transformative elixir. Just be wary of anyone offering you anything that would transform you so easily, easy is a lie and only leads to problems down the road."
Dreams,3e3s9r,Zallkar,1 point,Wed Jul 22 00:39:14 2015 UTC,"Interesting. I never really put much thought into it-- most of the dreams I have nowadays are just as surreal as this one, if not more.   For example, back in May I had a dream where I was the protagonist of a first-person magical fantasy game, and was fighting some evil dark spirit or something like that. The thing I remember about that though were my two sidekicks. They were small fairies, one of them was the goody two-shoes and the other was the rebel, and they would guide me through what I had to do in order to beat the bad guys. Weird, right?  I have so many other dreams to share but this comment is already kinda long, so I'll hold off for now XD  edit: forgot to thank you for the interpretation. Thanks!"
Dreams,3e39iu,_a_n_,2,Tue Jul 21 16:57:00 2015 UTC,"years and years away from ever having children.   When you say that it is socially and personally true but in a biological sense you are in your prime child bearing years right now. IMO the dream is about your paternal instinct awakening, it's a powerful thing."

Dreams,3e39iu,redjacak,2,Tue Jul 21 20:12:02 2015 UTC,Is there something in your life right now that you love like you did your dream daughter?
Dreams,3e39iu,RadOwl,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:21:27 2015 UTC,"Not at all! I mean the closest is my mom and my immediate family, but I specifically remember thinking that I loved the daughter more than that.   It could be that I have the desire to love someone or something like that?"
Dreams,3e39iu,RadOwl,3,Tue Jul 21 20:26:01 2015 UTC,I was thinking more along the lines of a long term idea for your life. One that you would nurture and take care of.
Dreams,3e1jma,Concanbill,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:23:37 2015 UTC,"I have no real answer about what your dreams mean for you. The one thing I want to say is that perhaps you have a very emotional and sympathetic reaction to movies that feature young adults in death challenges, i.e. Harry Potter, Hunger Games, etc. It's common to feel sympathy for characters in a movie or novel, then take your current challenges and fit them into the mould."
Dreams,3e1jma,KrystalLeo,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:03:23 2015 UTC,Thank you. I'm going through a stressful time of life and I just wanted to understand what they meant
Dreams,3e0zhx,DemoJack,2,Tue Jul 21 03:03:28 2015 UTC,"Your dreams reflect what's going on in your life. They tell stories using symbolism. So whatever it is about your dreams that are keeping you up, it's probably not as bad as it seems."
Dreams,3e1jbf,rainbowtomatoes,2,Tue Jul 21 06:19:57 2015 UTC,Are you perhaps building a new habit? the developing house could be an interpretation of a hobby.
Dreams,3e1jbf,White_Mocha,1 point,Tue Jul 21 08:27:13 2015 UTC,"Not really, at least not that I can think of for every time the dream occurred. These dreams have been seemingly random and over the course of a long period of time (six or seven months, maybe), which is why I only just put together that the house is changing constantly when I dreamed it had new floorboards."
Dreams,3e0vr6,moriahlayla,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:31:23 2015 UTC,You subconsciously know the meaning of the dreams and the messages you forget. There is something important in them for you. Sometimes though you have to be prepared for the messages. Perhaps something in you doesn't want to accept the messages and the changes in you they could spark.  A brush with death can change  a person. I suggest that you just sit alone and focus inside. Allow the quiet to speak to you. Pray if you feel like it. Tell yourself that you really do want to remember and know the messages.  Perhaps your father's energy is what gave you the push out of that bad situation in the water. Just a thought....
Dreams,3dz7vn,SirTwinkles,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:55:12 2015 UTC,"You do have an opposite sex twin. It's called your anima, and she is the face of your unconscious mind. However, how much do you know about your origins? Is it possible you have a fraternal twin?"
Dreams,3dz7vn,RadOwl,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:20:51 2015 UTC,"I do actually not know much about my origins. I never asked my parents much about my childhood. They have shared some stories.  I do have a photo of me and my grandma just after I got home after my birth.   This dream has woken something in me, something I never felt before. A longing, an ache, and I am too scared to ask my parents of there might be a twin out there."
Dreams,3dz7vn,RadOwl,1 point,Tue Jul 21 10:17:56 2015 UTC,"The only way to rule out one possibility is by asking. In the meantime, look up anima. We wrote a post about the subject a couple of years ago. Link. The focus is more on dreams about falling in love instantly with the perfect partner, but your dream essentially describes anima. It's like an opposite-sex twin. The psyche consists of two major sides, the conscious and unconscious. The unconscious side mirrors everything that is in the conscious side, except as the other gender. In men, the anima usually appears as the image of the perfect mate, or an inspiring female like a queen or princess.  Link to anima discussion"
Dreams,3dy1af,TheSkippySpartan,2,Mon Jul 20 13:47:01 2015 UTC,"Everyone poops. So whatever problem(the poop) you are having, you are treating it worse than it is(feeling awkward). Everyone has their problems, no need to feel awkward about it."

Dreams,3dy1af,Dream_Lord,2,Mon Jul 20 15:37:00 2015 UTC,"dreaming of pooping in front of other people is like the hardcore version of the typical ""naked in public"" or ""in public in your underwear"" dream. ;)   about a month ago I dreamed about that as well, and in that case the pooping came after rejecting sex, so I think there might be something about the need of release. like, you need to get something out, so your dream represents it as pooping, which is a primal form of release.   maybe you're aching to tell something to your coworkers/employees/annoying customers? reveal some secret?"

Dreams,3dzcjm,JonWood007,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:29:15 2015 UTC,"I find that the general theme of being back in school arises in dreams when confronted with something for which I feel unprepared. For example, when I was writing a book I encountered situations where the work was beyond my skill level. Organizing a book-length project is a tall order. I had to learn as I go.  So apply that idea to the situation in your dream. What do you feel unprepared for? One idea I have is perhaps you get questions about why you are atheist and are not sure how to answer. Math is related to logic, and in my experience it is logic that turns people off to fundamentalist Christianity.  Since you have to hide your atheism to fit in, I wonder if it's a comparison to having to hide something else about yourself to fit into a present situation in your life. Does that ring a bell?"
Dreams,3dzcjm,RadOwl,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:11:51 2015 UTC,"Oh, I know exactly why I'm an atheist. Logically speaking the issue is more or less settled, only in terms of emotion is it not totally solved, and that emotion is particularly toxic to my life.  I've kind of been wondering if the overwhelming aspect of it all was related to the concept of confidence. When I was a christian, I was confident in my life largely. As an atheist, while I'm intellectually smarter, I'm also lack confidence I used to have. In my dream, it's not simply that the work is hard, but that I also find it intimidating and in a sense just don't care and don't do it. Perhaps it's related to the fact that I've had trouble finding a job (I graduated grad school around the time I deconverted).  I know I mentioned this dream somewhat over on the ex christian sub, they also mentioned logic. Perhaps it has to do with the fact that I still somehow suspect that there's some sense of complex sense of logic that could reconnect me with God, and I'm somehow...missing it. I don't know, but you're not the first person who made that connection.   I always feel like I have to hide my true self to fit in. THe existential crisis that led to my atheism has caused me to adopt a lot of positions that are otherwise unpopular and controversial. I've also been suppressing some feelings for a girl who I tried asking out 3 years ago right before I deconverted, unsuccessfully. That's actually what the other set of recurring dreams I mentioned here are about (running into her again and all the awkwardness related to that, I consider those dreams a form of wish fulfillment). Although I don't really think that's related to these particular dreams.  A lot of these connections I'm making are largely speculation, but I'm mentioning them out of curiosity."
Dreams,3dzcjm,digitalgokuhammer,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:12:54 2015 UTC,"First the usual disclaimer I am not qualified at anything so I'm jmust freeballin' here so take what I say with a grain of salt.   When I was a christian, I was confident in my life largely. As an atheist, while I'm intellectually smarter, I'm also lack confidence I used to have.   I think your dream is really interesting.  IMO you're trying to incorporate this new sense of self (your atheism) with your life and who you thought you were. I think the school symbol is all about learning about who you are and how that fits in with the world.  Math is logical but it is also very arcane. It is strange and mysterious symbols which require knowledge to be able to interpret.    I always feel like I have to hide my true self to fit in.   This is really interesting, it kind of shows that your self is not fully aligned right now. It was, when you were a christian you had a very solid identity, now, however, things are in flux.   This   I've also been suppressing some feelings for a girl   is also linked to that. You're trying to build a new self which is consistent with all your beliefs but right now there isn't room for these emotions which will cause you some grief.   Perhaps it's related to the fact that I've had trouble finding a job (I graduated grad school around the time I deconverted).   This is also a HUGE junction in your life where you have gone from being on a track and being told what to do externally to having to find out what you want to do and where you want to go. That's very difficult, it's no wonder your dreams reach back to the time in your life when   I was actually in school, I was a very good student. Straight As, always did my work, never really needed tutoring, etc.   It makes a lot of sense that part of you wants to return there, you had a lot of praise, were doing well, had a solid identity, now you have lost all of these things.  What I'd like to say is I think you are doing well at life, that may sound strange, but basically this is a difficult time in people's lives (late 20's becoming a whole person who is internally driven) and it's a hurdle a lot of people fall at. You have been willing to reconstruct the whole basis of your identity (deconverting) and you are now working with the difficult consequences of that. That shows a lot of courage and integrity and therefore I think you will be fine.  This is super interesting   Logically speaking the issue is more or less settled, only in terms of emotion is it not totally solved, and that emotion is particularly toxic to my life.

Dreams,3dv63g,RadOwl,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:09:53 2015 UTC,"Young animals like kittens can symbolize children. Since you are pregnant, perhaps the dream is related. Perhaps the thought of having a kid is something you are getting comfortable with. What were your feelings about kids before you got pregnant, and has it changed recently? Perhaps the way you warmed up to the kitten is an analogy for warming up to the idea of having a child.  Just as an aside, I think you did right by following your heart and going through with the pregnancy. I'm not opposed to abortion, but know people who weren't able to have children later and regretted their abortions. A true friend would support your decision, not undercut and insult you."
