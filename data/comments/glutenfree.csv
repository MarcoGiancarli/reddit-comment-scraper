You do need a food processor though!  (Buy a cheap one if you don't have one already, you're not going to work it hard.)  What you need:    1 can of garbanzo beans  Olive Oil  Spices (cumin, paprika, smoked paprika, whatever you like)  Tahini (purchased at Whole Foods, Smart and Final and several other stores I've visited.  It's toasted sesame paste.)  Lemon  Anything else you like   Toss the garbanzo beans (drained) into the food processor.  Blend alone for a while with some olive oil.  Add everything else in and blend until smooth.  Enjoy!  I've made this with roasted garlic, then used the oil from roasting the garlic to add in.  This adds like, 10 minutes to the process.  I've used sun-dried tomatoes.  I've made it lemon heavy, lemon light.  I've added random savory things.  Literally all the flavors you see at the stores?  Just add that in when you blend.  This takes minutes at most, mostly involved with pureeing the beans."
glutenfree,3e3l3n,Noressa,3,Tue Jul 21 18:46:49 2015 UTC,"I second that. I use an immersion blender, the kind that looks like a boat motor. It's cheaper and takes less clean up."

glutenfree,3e3l3n,Noressa,2,Tue Jul 21 20:46:39 2015 UTC,"To really go all out, take a whole head of garlic, snip off the top so the edges of the cloves are showing. Drizzle a little oil on it and salt, wrap in tinfoil and bake it for forty minutes on like 350. Prep the ingredients as you said, then squeeze the freshly roasted garlic out of its papery covering and into the food processor. You will never buy hummus again. ðŸ˜Š"

glutenfree,3e2h7m,nubcakefactoryy,3,Tue Jul 21 13:35:09 2015 UTC,"It depends on the issue for sure! You should totally go see your DNP first. They will be able to recommend a specialist if necessary, which would probably be an ENT or the like.  Some people have chronic nasal drip for no reason, some people it's a hypersensitivity. There's tons of different things. Your DNP will be able to narrow it down better.  Make sure you mention all of the medications you've tried, and the frequencies and doses if you can. That would help.  As far as tests I'm not quite sure. I'm a medical technologist but I don't perform much testing for this kind of issue.

Suddenly I'm getting off 2-3 times a day.  For a man in his 30's, that is unusual.  Internet research suggested that avocado might be the culprit.    Add some to your diet and see what happens.

At the very least your diet has changed, and depending on the specifics of your condition, your hormone levels could be all over the place.   You should make sure you're checking in with your doctor so you know whether or not you have any issues (bloodwork.) But it takes time for your body to settle into its groove and for you to learn what ""normal"" is.   As long as you're seeing your doctor, eating right, and treating yourself right (that includes not beating yourself up over things like this) you'll eventually level out.   But this could be anything. It could be stress, anxiety, medications you might be on, lots of things.   As an older guy, if there's any advice I can give you as a young man, it's to not be bashful with your doctor. If you're on any substances, tell him. If your libido is flagging, tell him.

glutenfree,3dzdpr,Im_not_weird,3,Mon Jul 20 21:29:13 2015 UTC,Well I started the diet in January and by that summer I noticed how different and motivated I felt. I would guess approximately 5 months to feel completely recovered but I started feeling some of the effects earlier.
glutenfree,3dzdpr,Check12344,3,Tue Jul 21 03:43:46 2015 UTC,Nice. It's been two months now.  I never had GI symptoms but i had other physical symptoms limiting exerise which are most all gone.  Still just not all there mentally. And when you are recovering and get glutened it is one of the worst most counterproductive feelings

Yeah, sure, my stomach had a twinge for about 5 minutes. I lost 2 whole days. It's like poison.  A day after that, I was back to feeling perky and happy."

glutenfree,3dzdpr,EmeraldIvy,3,Mon Jul 20 23:41:05 2015 UTC,"Depression was a major symptom for me as well. I wasn't aware it was a symptom until after I gave up eating it though. For most of 2012 and before, I felt like crap. All fall of 2012 I mentally felt like i was going to die. I don't mean i wanted to commit suicide, i just didn't see myself being about to live into the next month. My outlook was horrible. In January 2013 I gave up gluten due to diarreah (However the eff you spell it). I noticed after a few months all of these problems in my life disappearing, such as muscle twitches, bad skin, and depression. By spring of 2013 I'd try gluten every now and then to ""treat"" myself and would again feel shitty for days and maybe weeks after but i'd still eat it sometimes. By fall 2013 I gave it up again and have not looked back since. The only time I have gluten now is by accident and I avoid it fully. I hated the shitty feelings it gave/give me and as much as i like the taste, I don't want the side effects in my life."

I still couldn't tell you if my anxiety issues are a result of being an undiagnosed celiac for so long or if my anxiety TRIGGERED the auto immune disorder in the first place. Whatever the case, the two DO seem to go hand in hand.   The only thing I know for sure is EVERY time I would throw up as a kid for what seemed like no reason at all it was always chalked up to ""nerves.""   I'm extremely careful now, but the stress and depression that comes along with it is, of course, still there. So is it a permanent side effect or the thing that triggered everything?   Sucks not knowing, but just today I was in the grocery store and a mother was shopping with her son (maybe 14) and reading all the labels saying ""This doesn't have wheat in it.

One of my fave chicken recipes is to coat a chicken breast with spicy brown mustard and then drizzle honey over it.  I apply the honey before putting it in the oven and after it comes out. You don't need too much honey. Maybe 1/2 a tablespoon or so per breast.  Stir fry veggies are great with black pepper, Cavender's seasoning and season salt. Lightly oiled and cooked quickly at high (if 1-10 heat settings,  use 7-9) heat.  Avoid recipes with dairy (and gluten of course). That means no ice cream for dessert. There are very good GF brownie mixes at most grocery stores.  I have celiac disease and stick to GF meals.  Good luck!"

Pizza's were cooked on a green egg style grill at around 500 deg for 10-12 minutes using fresh cheese etc.   The dough mix also makes some wicked good cinnamon rolls.
glutenfree,3dsn4e,trisaratops1,3,Sun Jul 19 02:42:20 2015 UTC,Can you give some more info on how you made it? I really like that mix but following the directions mine looks nothing like that!

glutenfree,3dsn4e,kitatwbobcat,2,Sun Jul 19 15:07:59 2015 UTC,We found the magic step is to precook the crust for about 5 mins (or until  the top just starts to get crusty). Always turns out gooey in the middle if we don't do that. Even with a pizza stone.

Also if you have IBS you need to focus on a low fat diet. Also watching some trigger foods. I can speak for days on this subject.
glutenfree,3dtrmf,thedlw,1 point,Sun Jul 19 11:33:13 2015 UTC,Hm...well I write down everything I eat every day but I eat stuff that's premade...gluten/dairy free of course. I don't think I'm so allergic to gluten that I can't have stuff that's been cross contaminated...because I've eaten SOME normal stuff with gluten in it and not been sick. So I don't go down to the detail on that.  Why low fat?
glutenfree,3dtrmf,saralt,2,Sun Jul 19 11:39:35 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'm suspicious of anyone advocating low-fat unless you have no gallbladder...   Low-fat tends to be high carb and bad for your gut microflora in case your ibs is linked to dysbiosis.

Well I felt like she slapped the label of IBS on me rather...quickly...same for my mom...she has IBS as well according to her doctor...but we both keep having stomach pain and other issues...so just saying it's IBS wasn't a cure all.  For both of us it's dairy...for me it's gluten/wheat and apples...and god knows what else...I think maybe tomatos but I'm not 100% on that...I just know when I eat a gluten/dairy free cheese pizza I get sick...so...yeah?
glutenfree,3dtrmf,thedlw,1 point,Sun Jul 19 12:03:00 2015 UTC,I had a colonoscopy which indicated I had too much bile in my digestive track. Generally your liver makes too much bile because your fat intake is too high.   The way I get around all of this is eating whole vegetables. The illusion that carbs are bad is horrible. Only certain carbs are bad. If you are eating a good amount of fiber with your carbs you will be fine. I eat sweet potatoes white potatoes and black beans everyday plus a bag of steamed mix vegetables and I still maintain even lose a little weight. Only when I eat bad carbs like wheat based products do I feel enflamed etc. It also depends on the type of food. I can eat breaded chicken fingers and only have minor post nasal drip.

And even ""safe"" foods can easily be cross-contaminated, and in my opinion, that was and still is the hardest for me to avoid.   Take my personal favorite, lobster bisque. Most use flour to thicken it, but I've come across lobste bisque from Wegman's that was made without it. When I was in New Orleans, I was absolutely bummed to find out that I couldn't eat jambalaya or gumbo. Here in the northeast, I've had it a number of times at restaurants, all made gluten-free.  Your list is extensive, but may not be useful. To say that most Italian food is made with gluten--I've successfully ordered risotto without a problem. I had a much easier time eating in Italy that in the US.  Unfortunately, things vary too much to really create a useful list. And what it comes down to is how it's prepared and how knowledgeable about gluten the person preparing the food is."

glutenfree,3dkfri,eldorel,4,Sat Jul 18 23:37:01 2015 UTC,"Corn tortillas from a store are pretty hard to deal with honestly. It only takes a day or two for them to start drying out, and once that happens they're pretty much impossible to roll or fold.   Making them fresh is pretty simple if you have a place to store a tortilla press or are willing to get creative with a couple of cutting boards (lot of videos on youtube).   However, if you're using store-bought ones, there are a few things you can do.   1) Make sure they're soft when you buy them! If the stack doesn't flex easily they're already too far dried out for wraps.   2) Don't freeze them. This will actually dry them out worse than leaving them in the cabinet. We buy the 8 inch stacks of mission-brand from target, and they last for up to 3 weeks if the bag is kept well sealed.   3) steam them before use. a few minutes suspended over a pot of steaming water is enough to make even dried out tortillas pretty flexible. The trick is to pull them right off of the steam and wrap them immediately.  30 seconds later and they'll start cracking again.   Good luck."

I went to the one that deals with meat, and the entire staff was beyond helpful every time I was there.    But you heard right; I never had a restaurant that couldn't accommodate me, and all of the pharmacies had gluten-free munchies (most on their own rack).    Also, GELATO.

It's like pointing out a humming light bulb to someone.  You know when someone points out that a halogen bulb is humming, and even though you didn't hear it before now all you can hear is the hum?  When you consume allergens constantly, your body is in a constant state of ""fight it off"" so symptoms are already being alleviated as they occur. Similar to a humming bulb that you never noticed.  When you stop eating those things, your immune system chills out a bit and takes a much-deserved break (or operating normally in other words).  So when those symptoms do hit, they hit an unprepared immune system.    It's like your body had a few minutes in a quiet room, and then returned to its desk under that humming bulb.

glutenfree,3deim3,Propyl_People_Ether,11,Wed Jul 15 21:22:53 2015 UTC,"Celiac disease damages the lining of the intestines. Going gluten free allows the intestines to begin to heal. Introducing gluten then causes the intestines to lose the healing progress, which feels more painful and more severe than the pain experienced before going gluten free. But the pain was less then because there was constant intestinal damage occurring to already damaged tissue. But it's important to allow the intestine to heal, because with the villi damaged you cant get enough proper nutrients from food and will suffer from mal-absorption issues and it can also trigger other auto-immune conditions. That's how my doctor described it to me.   So yes, being gluten free for a while and then getting glutened can seem worse than before you were gluten free at all and it's discouraging to a lot of people, and a lot give up and just stay on gluten (which then causes them all kinds of problems down the line).   It's very important to avoid gluten if you have a medical need to. I went a few years without getting glutened, and Sunday July 5 I was fed a birthday meal that I was assured was gluten free only to learn that it was very gluten heavy. It was the worst reaction of my life (for 5 years I had only had minor cross contaminations that would cause a day or two of distress). It was the first time since going gluten free that I had actually eaten a full blown gluten meal. Tasted awesome by the way, so at least there's that. But by the following Saturday I was on an IV drip to replace fluids that my system couldn't keep hold of. While the worst of the digestive symptoms are now over, I'm still in a funk and even had to get a steroid injection yesterday to try to get my body to just calm the heck down. My immune system seems to be still freaking out completely, and not just on my intestines. This is day 10. I'm recovering. The only treatment is to be sure to avoid gluten, and dont get lazy like me and start trusting people to know your meal is gluten free. I made a huge mistake and suffered the consequences.  I hope your girlfriend feels better soon."

Some might worry about cross contamination since they offer sandwiches too but he didn't have a problem. We were starved and didn't look too much at the other vendors since it seemed to mostly be fried stuff and pizza.
glutenfree,3depyf,katiboom,2,Wed Jul 15 18:15:08 2015 UTC,"Do some research about the ELISA blood test. It helped me so much. I suggest you do the level two, which tests for chemicals/environmental allergens as well as foods. Anything in your system that you are sensitive to will show up."

glutenfree,3depyf,slamjeez,2,Wed Jul 15 20:07:18 2015 UTC,Keep in mind that not everything shows up on tests. IBS or IBD whatever people call it simply cannot be diagnosed. Docs told me that if they did tests that came out negative and they have no clue what causes the problems and the symptoms check out they just call it IBS. I did celiec tests twice absolute negative yet i gave up on gluten I felt way better many symptoms faded. After a time you just gotta experiment with your diet. I strongly believe new civ problems are mainly caused by shitty diet and bad mental health.
glutenfree,3depyf,AlexTraner,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:43:30 2015 UTC,"It may also be an intolerance, which iirc can develop any time.   Side note, that diet sounds a lot healthier than mine, so I'm sorry you have pain and misery, but plus side! Forced healthy diet!"

I, too, continued to get tests done as I didn't feel better, but sometimes it just takes time (which sucks).  My recommendation would be to get off that gluten free cereal and pretzels and just go raw.  Then take a closer look at every supplement/thing you put in your body and try to make sure it's clear of corn, soy, gluten, and dairy.  I have kicked all hot peppers/potatoes/tomatoes for the most part as well. It was at least 6 weeks before I thought things would turn around.  8.5 weeks in now I am feeling a lot better but certainly not 100%.  Lastly, supplementing gf, non gmo vitamin D, B12, probiotics, and eating tons of fermented foods (kimchee, sauerkraut) will help.  Just fully commit yourself to a diet. I also recommend exercise/sitting in a sauna every day if possible.  Note:  I can't booze anymore either which is shitty.  I would go out 3-4 nights a week, which has just completely stopped."

glutenfree,3depyf,picklez4life,1 point,Thu Jul 16 12:48:48 2015 UTC,The raw diet really isn't ideal for anyone I don't think.  The idea is that it's a challenge for a couple months or so until you get healthy.  The longer you fight more extreme diet changes the longer it will take for you to heal.

My stand-by recipe is spreading it on toasted gluten free bread and melting white cheddar cheese on top, but since you aren't doing bread products, I have another suggestion.

Peppers and tomatoes (also a nightshade) are more inflammatory for me than potatoes.   Many people react to eggs. I do not seem to have any issues with them.  Coffee is a stimulant. For me it's no good.  Honey is high in fructose, so if you're doing FODMAPs or you are fructose intolerant, you'd want to avoid it.

If you don't have those weird gums people use in their gluten free recipes, try this loaf one below:  ""Whip up a few (I think it was two or three) leftover egg whites with two small eggs. Add about a half a cup of milk, some salt (maybe 1/2 tsp? maybe a bit more?), and a little dry yeast (again, maybe 1/2 tsp). Whip again.  Grind up about half a cup of flaxseeds in the blender. Whisk them into the egg-milk mixture. Let them sit for a few minutes to get nice and slimy.  In the meantime, grind up about the same amount of millet in the blender. Add it to the flax-egg-milk mixture. Let it sit for a few minutes to absorb.  Now mix in somewhere between 1/2 and 1 cup of tapioca flour. The dough should be wetter than a non-gluten bread dough, but it should be nice and sticky and stretchy from the eggs and flax.  Let it rise in a warmish place for, say, 45 minutes.  Put it in a small greased breadpan, muffin tin, or other baking dish, and let it rise for, oh, maybe half an hour.

However the proteins in wheat and barley and rye are slightly different. It is possible to have an allergy/intolerance to wheat gluten and not react to barley, which could account for the beer, meaning the beer didn't have wheat gluten but you got a little contamination in the corn meal perhaps.

glutenfree,3csont,rockstargnome,3,Fri Jul 10 13:57:39 2015 UTC,"First let me say one month may not be enough. It can take much longer to heal and feel better, and you could still have lingering effects, on top of any time you accidentally ingest gluten. This becomes a problem if you're still having issues, because after a month you think 'huh... I'm still having symptoms and it's been a month. I guess it's not the gluten!' When in reality that first time going gluten free is the one that takes the longest. If I accidentally have some gluten now it affects me (pain, tiredness, sore and stiff joints and neck, etc) for around 2-3 weeks.   That said, the number one absolute best way to make sure you're doing it right is to stop eating out, and don't buy too many products as replacement foods. Lots of places have gluten free on the menu when eating out, but you're trusting the employees to be totally diligent and the prep area to be clean. Which it likely isn't. And finding replacement foods is expensive and tricky, but can be ok.   For example there are gf breads and some are wonderful. Some cereal is gf, great! But when it comes down to it the cheapest and most sure way is to stick mostly with foods naturally gluten free. Meats, rice, potatoes, fruits, veggies. And sauce. Sauces and seasonings (read all ingredients every time) are your best friend. The same ingredients can be used every day of the week without getting old if you change the sauce and prep method.   So really just eat a bit natural and you're good!  Also depending on your living situation, get separate cutting board, cookware, etc. My family has one pot and pan for items with gluten, the rest are all gf only. I use my own space and cutting board for myself, and I use paper plates and bowls for prep work because there's no worry whether someone had gluten on there and whether it has all been cleaned off enough.   For starting off if you aren't sure, just buy a cheap cutting board and pot, and use disposable plates. Cut contamination risk as much as possible and then if you stay gf, you can learn how sensitive you are and adjust to math later.   Sorry I can't recommend any apps that work in UK, but hopefully this helps somewhat."

glutenfree,3cqi3b,cheesequeen89,8,Thu Jul 9 23:31:08 2015 UTC,"Gluten fragments can disrupt the transaminase levels in the liver, along with the more common transglutaminase (TTG) disruption found in NCGS and Celiac. Hypothesis is that specific gluten fragments that uptake through permeable intestine walls can mimic these enzyme's functions and misfold proteins, leaving excess serum levels of transaminase and other liver functions (lipids), as well as amyloid deposits that further interfere in liver function and can cause scarring (cirrhosis, fibrosis).    Liver abnormalities in celiac disease.  Celiac disease and risk of liver disease: a general population-based study.  While I never specifically tested my own liver enzyme levels, my lipids/cholesterol all went to normal after going GF.  Excessive carb eating will still spike them, but not nearly to prior levels."
glutenfree,3cqi3b,Perringer,2,Fri Jul 10 01:09:51 2015 UTC,"Same here, I am gluten intolerant and have autoimmune antibodies to my liver. However I don't know if being gluten-free had any effect on the autoimmune antibodies because I didn't get tested for that until a few years after I went gluten free. My functional doc put me on glutathione because of the liver thing, and that instantly changed my life and finally made me feel better.  Gluten is well known to be linked to autoimmune diseases of all kinds because of the effect it has on increasing the amount of zonulin in your gut, which is the signaling molecule that triggers your gut to become permeable. When that happens, larger particles of foreign matter end up absorbing into your bloodstream through your gut, triggering your immune system to create inflammation to neutralize it, sometimes creating antibodies to those particles that accidentally fit the same receptor sites in your own tissues, like your liver. So sometimes just eliminating gluten will completely reverse an autoimmune disease. Other times you need to take extra steps to reverse the gut permeability.  I'm not surprised, but it's cool to hear of more anecdotal evidence supporting this explanation."

If you trust random-guy-on-the-internet advice, start with <20g carbs/day, and increase fat to over 30% (fatty cuts of meat, cook your eggs in butter/bacon grease, whole milk instead of 2% or skim, etc.) and increase fiber rich veggies (spinach, asparagus, etc.).

She had her thyroid ablated too before learning how to treat autoimmune disease, so I think you will connect with that.  Extra steps in a nutshell: eat a paleo diet -- remove all grains and legumes, remove nightshades, eat nutrient-dense good quality meat, vegetables, fruits. Clear up any lingering gut infections and rebalance your gut microbiome. Eat bone broth and probiotic fermented vegetables to help heal the gut. Take care of any detoxification impairments and remove toxic products from your home. Filter the air and water in your home. Reduce stress, for example through meditation, yoga, breathing, deep relaxation, cognitive therapy. Get proper sleep. Take care of any adrenal fatigue and hormone imbalances.

Doc did a blood test, came back positive for celiac; however, a biopsy a few months later came back negative, as did another blood test.

Despite the confusion with the tests, I can positively say I feel 100x better, stomach is better, liver enzymes are normal for the first time in 11 years, migraines are gone, and I get very sick within one hour of consuming gluten."
glutenfree,3cqi3b,ceb2993,1 point,Thu Jul 9 23:46:09 2015 UTC,"I have lifelong (that's over five decades now) of not only total wheat (family and byproducts) intolerance but the same for soy, eggs, peanuts (but now all nuts), and citric acid.  Since then, I've had to add potatoes, rice, and carrots particularly to the list of things that cause violent reaction in me.  If I get any of those things into me, even by breathing the dust of the offending product or touching it (think what fun grocery stores are for me), I start having reactions.  Initially this comes as a cold or numb feeling in the center of my tongue but then later it feels as though somethings is working its way around my ears and cheeks.  Then the liver complaints start: liver pain, intestinal cramping, pale stools.  For days after that, I can taste infection in my mouth and my breath reflects this as well.  The citric acid intolerance has actually been the worst because virtually everything contains it to some degree except, blueberries.  However, I spent two years consuming little else than wild fermented foodstuffs that I cultured at home.  Cost was minimal.  I made kefir from raw organic goat's and cow's milks, I brewed kombucha, I wild fermented all the vegetables I can tolerate well enough, I ate cheese from raw, organic milk.  Sadly, I also put on some extra pounds doing this.  My energy level was very low and I dislike the cold quite a lot, which is unfortunate when living in subarctic regions.  The end result is that now I can eat just about anything with citric acid and there's no real reaction anymore.  Plus there are patches of my hair that are fully returning to the shade I had in my youth.    We intolerants may just be canaries in a coalmine but no one can tell me that our farming practices aren't to blame for this."

Gluten is very pro-inflammatory. And Gluten is low in the glycemic index. Ok, yeah.   What does this mean? Since gluten is a protein, it will affect your blood sugar LESS than a carbohydrate. We know this. But because your body has a very hard time breaking down gluten, it creates an IgA (autoimmune) response and by proxy it attacks other tissues. We also know this. Now, if you are poor and don't have ANY food, and you will die from starvation, go ahead eat that. But if you are making a decision for the less inflammatory food source, why wouldn't you go gluten free?  When I go to the market, I try to buy local. Not for any other reason but to help my community. I might even pay a little more. I don't need an article telling me that berries from Guatemala are the same than Berries from Tempe Arizona, I don't care. It's not about nutrition, calorie or flavor. My purchase is to benefit my community.   Choosing to be gluten free is as much a statement to the scientific community about our insane nutrition science as it is a conscious decision about consuming more nutritionally dense food sources, less inflammatory foods and less processed carbohydrates. I really don't care if subway's new gluten free sandwich has a higher glycemic index than their whole grain even though it costs thirty cents more. Also, why would you eat at subway?"

Didn't take the symptomatic treatment meds that they recommended and decided to just adhere to diet. My thyroid stimulating hormone dropped from around 8/9 to 3 so technically I'm no longer subclinically hypothyroid though! I'm honestly just thinking about adopting keto full time as any grains seem to cause bloating for me. They also tested my immunoglobulins ($10,000 of blood tests!) for IgG, IgA and... IgE? (not sure about that last one). Anyway, it didn't turn up a thing. Saw a infectious disease specialist at Yale... they just told me to keep up with my diet.  My (layman's) opinion is that my gut got thrown off by antibiotics. I've done a few tests like the ""GI Effects comprehensive stool profile"" that showed I have some abnormal distribution of gut bacteria.   Drinking alcohol is also extremely detrimental to me. My hangovers last days where I hate everyone and everything. After this 4th of July I think I'll just cut that out as well. I don't drink glutinous beers but even non-gluten beers or apple cider will cause me throat inflammation/discomfort. Same with random shit like certain seafood, like tuna, salmon, tilapia, etc; raw vegetables like white onion, tomato (i'm calling it a veggie, deal with it); sometimes fruit like banana and others. That seems to be associated with ""cross-allergy syndrome.""  Soo I'm in the dark with you. It seems to me that my autoimmune disorder has just started targeting things at random.

glutenfree,3cbydt,Reddily,6,Mon Jul 6 23:59:16 2015 UTC,"Good article, headed more in the right direction about halfway through. I think ANY food intolerance/allergy boils down to what this article started to pick at - the bigger picture. Over in Keto, to lose weight they say it's ok to eat at mcdonalds (if you have to) and just go bunless, as an example. All the meat we ingest... Isn't healthy. Especially in America. We eat more meat than anywhere else. I myself am guilty of this, doing a roughly half and half keto/paleo diet.  I'd like more research on that please - the long term benefits/non benefits of higher-than-normal meat consumption. I DO know that the Mediterranean diet is the healthiest all around diet, in general, that a person could have... More lean fish than red meat.  Also missing was the fact that Monsanto introduced a new type of wheat in the 50's, and since then gluten sensitivity has increased bigtime. I'm on my mobile, or I would link it, but I did a paper on this a few years back and that was a major point I drew off of. A lot of evidence points at that, in the last 50 or so years. Sure, maybe we ate twice as much wheat in the 19th century, but the quality of bread was probably vastly different as well. Our systems have changed - they note it in the Finland/Russian portion. I think that's a great example."
glutenfree,3cbydt,curiouscuriousmtl,5,Mon Jul 6 20:48:02 2015 UTC,"I have not read the article, so maybe they cover this... but there are really a lot of things we do differently with wheat. As of very recently it took bread hours or days to rise. Now it's done in 10 minutes. I don't know if Subway ever smelled good, but it smells weird now. I also think it's maybe because the grain is different like you say. But people say ""bread is bread"" like it is. But it's not the same bread we made 40 years ago and certainly not the same we made 10,000 years ago.  Fungible goods aren't always so. My gf told me ""coffee gives me heartburn"" but I corrected her and proved her wrong. I had that same problem with drip and espresso from a lot of purveyors. But then I tried espresso that was extracted properly from ""specialty"" cafes and I was fine. Now I make my own, and I know if I did it right it won't have extracted whatever bitter elements that give me stomach upset.   People have told me gluten sensitivity doesn't exist. But just because science isn't there yet doesn't mean it isn't real for me and doesn't mean that science won't be there, sooner than later perhaps."
glutenfree,3cbydt,NikkiJayne28,2,Mon Jul 6 21:55:16 2015 UTC,"I've never heard that about coffee before -- that coffee giving people heartburn may not be an accurate description of what's going on. Would you be willing to explain a bit more? I've had trouble with coffee on and off, and I do notice a difference with (what I assume is) high vs. low quality coffee, but have no idea or theory as to why. I'd like to learn more about what you're referring to."
glutenfree,3cbydt,hpsterscum,1 point,Mon Jul 6 22:35:58 2015 UTC,"I can only really describe it as heartburn. Not as such as acid boils into your mouth. But your throat burns like you were maybe vomiting. Lower down in the chest really. I actually got it all the time as a kid when I ate Wonderbread or another really enriched/bleach/refined bread. I had symptoms back then but had no idea it was gluten intolerance.   Basically all drip coffees give me this problem. Some are better than others. I don't know exactly what it is. But coffee theory (not related to heartburn or gluten intolerance) is that the first water you pour over some grounds you get good coffee extracts and flavours. But after a certain point all you get is more harsh chemicals from the beans.  So drip coffee, which continually washes the beans, is the worst along with french press etc. Stuff like Aeropress and espresso have either really short steep times or small volumes of water passing over the grounds.  It also seems to be the quality of the coffee beans themselves. Maybe because they tend to be a darker roast to make up for the lack of quality.  Wish I could say more, you can try something like Stumptown espresso, and then Dunkin Donuts drip coffee and see which is worse. I don't know where you live so I can't help you find the bad/good cafes"

I eat a lot of meat, but I'm aware of this - doesn't really stop me. I just try to balance it with omega 3's as much as possible, as they reduce inflammation. Along with Pilates/planks for musculature, lots of constant hydration and taking most grains out, my levels seem to me to be balanced. Point in case, that's just my particular story."

glutenfree,3cbcur,ddIbb,2,Mon Jul 6 21:25:24 2015 UTC,"Absolutely.  I am not celiac, but I avoid wheat for exactly this reason.  For about a year, I was developing arthritis in my joints and had no idea why. The amount of pain I was in was actually scary because I didn't know how to stop it, and it was just getting worse. My doctor suggested I cut wheat out of my diet. I did, and finally, the pain went away completely over a few days.  Now, if I accidentally eat wheat, I'll have telltale pain that starts in my knees and spreads to the rest of my joints over 24 to 48 hours.  One night, I ate what I was told was gluten free pasta from a pizza place near my friends' house and started to get the familiar symptoms 45 min to an hour afterward. I bought a gluten test and was able to test a piece of the remaining pasta a couple days laterâ€”sure enough, ""high gluten content"". I went back to the restaurant with the test results, and they denied it until I guess they realized I wasn't leaving without them admitting they fucked up. Long story short, I got my money back, which is the least they could have done.  That was essentially a blinded test. I never have any pain from eating gluten free pasta. This is why I say the gluten sensitivity deniers can go fuck themselves.  Also, being glutened really makes me feel for the people with celiac, because their reactions can be much more severe, and the carelessness of some people is astounding."

It gives me, along with many others on this sub, the most HORRENDOUS gas. Not painful gas, just smelly, frequent, loud flatulence."
glutenfree,3c7vcf,dustinhxc,1 point,Mon Jul 6 18:17:08 2015 UTC,I'll have to look into that... I'm lactose intolerant as well as gluten intolerant so I just assumed it was the butter I was putting on the bread that was making me gassy.

glutenfree,3c2m7i,cosmiccomputer,3,Sat Jul 4 04:31:52 2015 UTC,"I have a lot of the same symptoms when I get contaminated foods, I was tested positive for CD 5 years ago, I've gotten really good at eating careful and knowing where to go that is safe, but as we all know, nowhere is 100% safe.   Typically when I do get sick from contamination I can feel it in my stomach right away, then for a few days after I have full body aches, head aches, mood swings, the horrible combination of constipation and diarrhea....   It sucks, a lot, but when you get sick, and you know what its from, you don't let it happen again. Either you double check with the server, or read the label 3 times instead of 2, or if it is a restaurant that just keeps messing up you might not want to go back there at all.... Whatever the mistake, you just have to learn from it and know better for next time. Good luck!"

That occurred occasionally for the first 6 months of being gf, after that accidental exposure has not been as bad though I try my best to avoid it."

I made cookies Tuesday, and my family isn't gluten free and they knew those cookies were mine, then I looked yesterday and there were 2 left! 2! I made so many! I don't mind if they have one but I hardly got any!"

glutenfree,3bzmw6,Bi_olinist,2,Fri Jul 3 13:07:55 2015 UTC,"Gluten Ataxia is a real condition. It's suspected that in addition to transglutaminase 2 (TG2) disruption commonly found in Celiac's, there can also be TG6 disruption. TG6 is an important neurological/motor development/maintenance enzyme. It's disruption or an IgA auto-immune response to it has been noted among not just sufferers of gluten ataxia, but also ALS & Parkinson's patients.  Not a diagnosis; just providing info."

glutenfree,3bv1u0,Thermodynamo,7,Thu Jul 2 11:32:17 2015 UTC,No one gluten-free flour is a good swap for wheat flour. You really need a combination of starches and flours. I'm not sure what the point of that really was.
glutenfree,3bv1u0,Ratscallion,3,Thu Jul 2 17:27:36 2015 UTC,"You also need to adjust the liquid.  The coconut flour is the best example of this. It absorbs way more water than any other flour and requires extra liquid ingredients to work properly.  If you do that, coconut flour can make some amazing cookies and very moist cakes."
glutenfree,3bv1u0,eraser-dust,2,Thu Jul 2 19:20:39 2015 UTC,"Yep. All in all, just a stupid experiment. shakes head"
glutenfree,3bv1u0,Ratscallion,2,Fri Jul 3 00:21:26 2015 UTC,"Not totally.  It's still a good way to demonstrate how different flours holds up in a basic recipe.  But as for a wheat flour replacement, there's a ton more baking science that has to go into it."
glutenfree,3bv1u0,eraser-dust,2,Fri Jul 3 00:30:35 2015 UTC,Going to have to pick up some sweet white sorghum flour that looks tasty!
glutenfree,3bv1u0,AlexTraner,1 point,Thu Jul 2 14:07:38 2015 UTC,Any idea if this is something a larger grocery store would carry?  Or should I just assume I need to order online?
glutenfree,3bv1u0,2boredtocare,1 point,Thu Jul 2 15:40:40 2015 UTC,Pretty sure my local Kroger has it. I'm slightly less sure but it may be bobs red mill brand.
glutenfree,3bv1u0,AlexTraner,1 point,Thu Jul 2 16:03:16 2015 UTC,"cant see my comment from here but no, it wasn't at the local Kroger. May be more specialty after all."
glutenfree,3bv1u0,AlexTraner,1 point,Thu Jul 2 19:09:01 2015 UTC,"I always found that sweet sorghum flour had a weird taste. My preference is using a mix of brown/white rice flour and a starch (tapioca or potato ideally) in a 2:1 weighted ratio. So for a recipe that calls for a cup and a half flour, you need 210 grams and 140 should be rice, and 70 should be starch."

glutenfree,3bv1u0,elye,2,Fri Jul 3 22:12:38 2015 UTC,"This is a good look at the various flours' behaviors, but none of them really showed off their potential, especially the wheat flour.  The author didn't chill the dough, which is really critical for proper drop cookies.  The wheat cookie should not have spread out that much.   America's Test Kitchen released a book about their tests on various gluten free flours.  If you like science, baking, and gluten free things, I really recommend it."
glutenfree,3bv1u0,Amlethus,1 point,Thu Jul 2 18:18:34 2015 UTC,"Huh, that was very interesting. I would not have guessed sorghum would yield such a good result. I wish they had tested buckwheat and corn too though. Though I guess corn has so many flour like byproducts (corn meal, masarepa, masa harina, corn flour, corn starch), you could do a series on it alone."
