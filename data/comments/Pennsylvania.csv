Pennsylvania,3e3axh,Pronto_Breakneck,2,Tue Jul 21 22:39:18 2015 UTC,"Big breed dog   I'm familiar with Ben's, they're about 15 minutes from my house.   In fact, they were the first place we went when looking for a dog.  I sent in an application and spoke with them on the phone.  Everything looked great, they said.  They'd give me a call as soon as they had a suitable dog.    I never heard from them again.   It's only been 16 months or so.  Perhaps they'll call tomorrow.   Beagles  lab  husky   Breed-specific rescue organizations are why the shelters only contain breeds that are listed in the specific exclusions section in my homeowner's insurance policy.  They're part of the problem.  I'm not speaking from ignorance when it comes to the availability of suitable dogs at shelters.  We've had three dogs in the last ~15 years, and I looked extensively at shelters each time before giving up.  I've also been involved with two different breed-specific rescue organizations, including fostering dogs waiting for homes.    I already have a job, and I don't have time to run the shelter circuit twice a week hoping to snag a new arrival before Aunt Susie's Used Golden Retriever Emporium comes through and takes the dog so she can get her $150 ""evaluation"" cut.  While I can appreciate the fact that breed-specific rescue organizations make more room in the public shelters so dogs don't need to be killed quite so quickly, the reality is that the whole system is fundamentally broken."
Pennsylvania,3e3axh,righty,3,Wed Jul 22 00:51:35 2015 UTC,And it's broken because we breed more dogs than we have willing owners.
Pennsylvania,3e3axh,Pronto_Breakneck,1 point,Wed Jul 22 01:30:24 2015 UTC,"Well, that sounds simple enough.  Let's just get everyone together and tell them to breed fewer dogs.  Like it or not, those backyard breeders are always going to exist.  Amateur breeding has a low capital barrier to entry, and Mother Nature does most of the legwork for you.  It's easy money, and there's always going to be some irresponsible shit with two dogs and a collectible ceramic unicorn habit to feed.  Furthermore, there will always be a market for those dogs.  There will always be people who are unable or unwilling to comply with the adoption requirements of a shelter, let alone the typically stricter requirements of an ethical breeder or breed-specific rescue organization.  There will always be people who want a specific breed of dog, but lack the competence to effectively evaluate whether or not a breeder is ethical.  There will always be people who lack the financial resources to pay what an ethical breeder charges.  There will always be people who just don't give a shit, and just want a dog.  This is a complex problem.  If it has a solution at all, that solution will not be expressed as a one-sentence platitude."

Pennsylvania,3e2bdr,susinpgh,10,Tue Jul 21 12:23:15 2015 UTC,"Same reason as everywhere else: when institutional mental facilities were closed down in the 1970s due to (often well-founded) concerns about abuse and (often bullshit) concerns about infringing upon the rights of the mentally ill, no alternative facilities or support mechanisms were put in their place. The result is that someone who would have been much better off in an institution, i.e., housed, clothed, and fed, is now most likely to end up homeless. Being homeless is about one step away from being in jail.  That's on top of the fact that the mentally ill are far more likely to do the kind of things that get the cops involved in the first place. Mind you, I don't mean ""commit crimes."" Tons of entirely mentally healthy people do that every day, often of the sort that are never discovered. No, I mean that mentally ill people engage in the kind of public and anti-social behavior that attracts negative attention from observers, raising the probability that someone will call the police. Once the police are on the scene, the most likely outcome is that they make an arrest, either because (1) police see the person doing something that really is a problem and should result in criminal charges, or (2) police find the person to be annoying and problematic, though not actually criminal, but make the arrest anyway as they've got no other viable way of diffusing the situation.   Once a person is in the criminal justice system, it's very difficult for them to get out, even if they do have their shit otherwise together. For someone with mental illness, it's basically impossible. So a conviction for defiant trespassing or disorderly conduct turns into two years of probation (or whatever), and the next time they get arrested they're found to have violated their probation. Etc."

When Joe did tell head of campus police and his other boss what the assistant coach relayed to him (Joe), the state did an internal investigation into Sandusky which involved state department of child welfare, numerous state psychiatrists, local police officers, and not to mention the local district attorney, who went missing shortly after. After the investigation, they ruled the 1998 incident be closed  and found  Sandusky innocent, although investigators believed they had enough evidence to prosecute. PSU forced his resignation afterwards.   Sandusky was provided millions through the state after his PSU career to begin the second mile organization, no relation to Joe or PSU, where he continued his molestations through the 2000's.   The real problem with this Sandusky situation lies at fault with the state officials who did not correctly identify and prosecute a child predator in 98 while additionally funding his organization once they declared him innocent.

I worked through child service agencies in PA and can tell you from experience, our investigation process lets literally disgusting amounts of child abuse slip through the cracks, I couldn't imagine what it was like in '98. I knew a 6 year boy who was pushed out a 2 story window by his abusive dad, CYS called in, did the investigation, ruled nothing happened and closed the case.

All that having been said I personally am for far more freedom than we currently have, i would vote in favor of the ability of private citizens to own anti-aircraft weaponry, grenades etc. But I have known too many rash and irresponsible people who would be eager and willing to purchase a gun on a whim to go on a rampage with to hold the idea seriously that waiting periods or background checks are anything but a positive stopgap to remove the emotional responses of unstable people.   So you are for liberty, except you are not because you misperceived that people were violent. People like you get little fearful thoughts in their head, and think that this is grounds to violate a persons rights. People like you are why we have and need the bill of rights.  This society was founded on liberty, and liberty and security are mutual enemies that can't coexist."

Worlds End State Park also has many camp sites, more hiking trails and mountain vistas, a snack shop, etc. Loyalsock Creek has cliffs and a boulder beach. This is a very popular state park and is frequently crowded. There are only a few villages nearby; Laporte, Forksville, and Eagles Mere so getting supplies might be a bit challenging.   Eagles Mere is an interesting village, like a bit of the Poconos in central PA. It has many million dollar Victorian summer homes around Eagles Mere Lake but I think the lake is only open to a private association. I always stop at The Sweet Shop in Eagles Mere, an old fashioned Ice Cream parlor, for lunch when visiting Worlds End State Park. Eagles Mere is puzzling to me. It is a tiny little village run like an exclusive resort."

Pennsylvania,3dbbpp,Ysance,2,Tue Jul 14 23:13:54 2015 UTC,Can you explain?
Pennsylvania,3dbbpp,Big_Test_Icicle,11,Tue Jul 14 23:50:39 2015 UTC,"Sure.   The issue is that local municipalities have enacted ordinances restricting gun rights. This is a problem because the state has a preemption law which makes such local ordinances illegal and invalid, however the municipalities enforce them anyway. The way it works now, in order to have standing to sue and get the illegal ordinance overturned, you have to first be arrested for violating it.  To prevent innocent people from being harmed by these illegal ordinances, the legislature passed a law which allows third party groups such as the NRA to sue to overturn those laws on behalf of people who have been or may be harmed, even if those individuals don't have the desire to participate in the suit.  The new law was tacked onto another bill, which is against the PA constitution, making it invalid. Now the legislators are reintroducing the bill as a stand alone measure. So, this is how the law should have been passed in the first place, and it is a good law which will protect innocent people from arrest and prosecution for violating ordinances which should not exist because they violate state law.  If you oppose this law, in effect you are saying that you think people should be arrested and prosecuted for violating local laws which are illegal according to state law, local laws which shouldn't exist. These local laws create a patchwork of different restrictions which can easily ensnare innocent people who are unaware of them, because ignorance of the law is no excuse.  If you don't like state preemption of firearm laws, then advocate to have state preemption removed, but there is no purpose to enforcing illegal local laws which harm innocents."

I don't think income to the state or employment are reasons for having government monopolize private retail sales.  And there are no valid reasons that someone could give me that would change that position.   If money and employment are sufficient reason to you, then you should be advocating for state monopolization of many more private retail sectors.  Think about how much profit there would be in state monopolized gas stations.  Now in a state run model, it would only sell unleaded.  Diesel would be sold at a different store and there would be any fountain soda or hot coffee or snacks and other road goodies. You'd have to go somewhere else to get that.  But the state would make money and employee people.  Yay! The state!   The current system fails consumers.  It's not just state store that don't work.

Roosters naturally have these spurs, but the attachment of a metal spur does more damage, and I believe you can trim the natural ones.  Maybe so you can handle them better?  As far as dogfighting goes, I'm pretty sure that they use certain steroids and other things to improve fighting and to help the dog recuperate after a fight.

Pennsylvania,3co3em,susinpgh,3,Thu Jul 9 12:21:39 2015 UTC,"I never come in contact with minors at my job, and there's no reasonable expectation that I ever will, yet I had to get clearances. It also makes it difficult to hire part time employees because they have to pay for the clearances. So, a new near minimum wage position requires the new employee to pay a decent sum of money before they can start and it causes a delay in when the employee can start. It's easier and cheaper for that person to get a job elsewhere.  I think it's a good law, but poorly implemented. Hopefully the legislature continues to listen to feedback and refine the law.  Also, I don't like that I had to submit fingerprints to the FBI. Previously law enforcement had no record of me, now they do. I fell like a criminal."
Pennsylvania,3co3em,jungleboogiemonster,2,Thu Jul 9 13:18:03 2015 UTC,"I wonder if your employer ever considered that he should be the one paying for the clearances?

Pennsylvania,3co3em,jungleboogiemonster,1 point,Thu Jul 9 13:30:02 2015 UTC,"Good followup comment.  The employer does reimburse the employee after they pass the clearances and is hired, but it is a burden to the person being hired, especially since most of our part time hires are broke college students. It's a burden other jobs don't have and makes it harder for us to compete for employees. Present employees had all expenses paid for directly and there were never any out of pocket expenses.  I wasn't aware that the law applied to protected classes, and like you said, I'm sure many aren't."

Pennsylvania,3cl8n5,Shakespeare_Cowboy,1 point,Wed Jul 8 19:55:07 2015 UTC,"That's funny because I just asked mine to stop supporting it. The lack of addressing pension reform in of itself makes this budget unsustainable. Property tax cuts would be temporary when schools are expected to come up with the money to support the pensions (locally 40% of the school districts budget). The continued increase in pension costs will drive property taxes back up make no mistake, because the budget is for a cut not abolishing them.  The smoke screen and inability to compromise (on both sides) is status quo and hurting the state. The best plan almost guarenteed to be a melting of both sides plans together, but I do not want either sides proposal accepted as they are."

If it said ""document must reflect"" then I could see the argument that they didn't take it...unless the argument is being made that ""email"" is the same as ""mail"", of which I disagree.  Heck, it goes for further explanation further down saying no copies will be accepted.  Something you printed on your computer is a copy, not the original document.  You can only get the original document from the utility company.  that's the piece of paper you get in the mail from them.  OP did't follow directions and is upset."
Pennsylvania,3cftor,righty,2,Wed Jul 8 12:12:56 2015 UTC,"It is an environmental issue. Driving an hour to find out that the documents that were printed online won't be accepted is a waste of fossil fuels and paper. Then having to contact banks, utilities, car insurance etc. and have them re-send the documents via mail is more waste of paper. Then there will be another hour drive back to the DMV once said documents arrive. This is using more fossil fuels and adding more pollution to the environment.   IMHO it's also a violation of the Paper Work Reduction Act.   If they need proof of residence, a person can easily print a proof of change of address from the post office. Nearly everything is done electronically. Many people do not receive documents in the mail anymore. The only mail I receive is junk mail or personal mail.  A mortgage statement that shows the persons name and address should be sufficient. It's not easy to get your name on a mortgage for a specific property. It shouldn't matter if it was printed or mailed."

Pennsylvania,3cftor,myladymylady,2,Wed Jul 8 13:08:22 2015 UTC,"If someone chooses to waste resources that offer no actual proof of residency, it is their fault, not the agent that points out that they do not establish residency.   Perhaps the next step, acquiring the actual documents to prove residency, seems like another waste, but it is not, it is the intent of the measure.   A second trip is only a waste because one could have done it in one step if they had, maybe, called the DMV and asked a question before coming?"

From the article:    Moreover, DePasquale says nothing about the loss of tax revenue from corporate tax breaks and the economic downturn, or the diversion of pension resources to cover budget shortfalls, which are at the heart of problem. Rejecting any proposals to raise corporate taxes, he declares, “The task force recommends that any proposed revenue enhancements be considered only if structural changes are made to the plans.”   Workers have encountered, since 2008, un and under employment, benefit cuts, wage stagnation, higher costs of living thus resulting in levels of social inequality not seen since the Great Depression.

Hazleton isn't insanely dangerous, but I wouldn't feel 100% safe their either.  The town is broken after decades of corrupt politicians, falling housing prices, and consequential increases in a seedier inner-city population.  The valley, on the other hand, is rather safe and doesn't tend to experience the crime/drug trade that's become so characteristic of Hazleton.  I love NEPA/Poconos area, but it's better to live outside Hazleton if it's at all possible to avoid it.   That said, if she truly is stuck in the middle of hazleton, just know where to avoid.  For instance, I wouldn't go walking down Diamond Ave at night.  Hazle-Township isn't bad, and wouldn't be a place I'd be very afraid to be at night.    There are certainly racial tensions in the area, but that isn't something she'd have to worry about."

You can also go to another state that sells the good fireworks and purchase them there. Granted, you can then get in trouble for setting them off in Pennsylvania. Interstate commerce laws state that it's not the responsibility of the seller to make sure that what they are selling you is legal in other states, that's on the buyer. That's why you can purchase fireworks that are illegal for you to have in your state, in a state that does sell them. Or even illegal in the state you are purchasing them in. Correct me if I'm wrong on this, but it's my understanding."

Pennsylvania,3b99xl,righty,1 point,Sat Jun 27 00:46:43 2015 UTC,"I think same-sex marriage should be legal, but I don't think anyone  has the right to marriage.    I think a newspaper that throttles views it opposes does a disservice to the public.  Can we no longer submit letter supporting gun control (Heller v. DC among others)?  We can longer advocate a pro life stance (Roe v. Wade).  Campaign finance reform is also off the table (Citizens United v. FEC).    There are many issues the court has decided that are still ripe for discussion, but this newspaper is taking a stance against discourse on this issue.    From my vantage point this is more evidence that for some tolerance means agreeing with me."
Pennsylvania,3b99xl,susinpgh,2,Sat Jun 27 00:56:05 2015 UTC,I don't believe they are taking it off the table. It sounds like they are willing to publish letters that discuss the ruling.  I'm not sure I understand the distinction that you're making about the right to marriage. And I certainly don't see how you're connecting all this with muzzling discussion on gun control.
Pennsylvania,3b99xl,susinpgh,0,Sat Jun 27 14:00:02 2015 UTC,"If marriage is right then the state needs a compelling reason to deny the right. You have the right to own a car (the state can't prevent you from buying a legal product). You don't have a right to drive that car. That state has a compelling reason to keep roadways safe.   For instance, you'll hear people saying this opens to the door to incest and that is ridiculous, in sense. Fathers won't be able to marry daughters as a result of this ruling; however, states may have to alter their definitions of incest or permit marriage beyond a level of consanguinity that they are comfortable with.  Say Maryland won't allow aunts and uncles to marry, but they will allow first cousins (the children of those aunts and uncles). Virginia doesn't think first cousins marrying is a good idea. Does Virginia now have to recognize a marriage between cousins? Marriage is now a right, not something that can be restricted without some cause. What cause does VA have when MD says it's all good.   Polygamy: Steve is a bisexual man. He loves Sally and Bill, but he can only marry of them. Currently, he has to deny his sexuality and only marry one partner. Only one of his beloved can reap the benefits of marriage (health ins, tax status, legal protections). He has the right marry. How can a state force him to deny his sexuality and not allow him to marry those he loves?   My point about the gun control and other settle cases is that Pennlive is going to restrict discussion of the gay marriage issue. Are they going to restrict discussion of other issues that have been decided in the courts?"

Pennsylvania,3b2ugj,DahBizomb,10,Thu Jun 25 14:54:20 2015 UTC,"There's a direct conflict with this ruling, in case law.  I've been following one of the lawyers involved in these lawsuits.  This is definitely going to the state supreme court, and likely going to be overturned.  Regardless, though, Harrisburg and other municipalities cannot enforce the illegal ordinances, because the second the arrest hits a court, any attorney worth the suit he's wearing is going to have it thrown out."
Pennsylvania,3b2ugj,Helassaid,6,Thu Jun 25 15:44:32 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure the state supreme court will overturn this ruling since the way the law was passed was unconstitutional. The state constitution says that laws need to have a single purpose and the original law was to create penalties for those who stole metals, such as copper pipes. The legislature tacked on act 192 onto this law. The two laws are unrelated and the court decided that they should not have been passed together. It's reasonable to expect the state supreme court to rule the same way. Why did the legislature tack act 192 onto an unrelated law? It's likely they wanted this to end up in court just for a chance to denigrate the courts for overturning a law that's very popular with their constituents. It's a law that would have passed on its own and would have likely stood up in court, yet it was passed in a way that made certain it would fail. This is most likely political grandstanding at the cost of our courts to gain points with voters and not about protecting the gun owners of Pennsylvania. Regardless of the party, our politicians serve themselves and not those they represent."
Pennsylvania,3b2ugj,jungleboogiemonster,3,Fri Jun 26 00:07:38 2015 UTC,"The PA Supreme Court has a habit of upholding laws that run counter to the single subject rule. A great example is Act 71 of 2004, which authorized slots parlors at race tracks:  ""The ruling was the result of a lawsuit filed in December by a group of gambling foes and good-government advocates who claimed state lawmakers exceeded their authority by transforming a one-page statute that would have allowed state police to fingerprint people seeking horse-racing licenses into a 145-page law - Act 71 - that effectively created an entire gambling industry.""  http://m.lancasteronline.com/news/high-court-upholds-pa-slots-law/article_af10f685-beff-5447-b809-8b150aafbc7b.html?mode=jqm"

It's almost like the legislators behind it were like ""yeah, we know we're not following the correct constitutional procedure, but we're doing that on purpose.  That way we can show to our supporters that we're behind gun owners rights but not really be behind them.""  Let's not forget that Republicans controlled the state house, senate and governorship in 2014.  To enact the bill properly, with all T's crossed and i's dotted so that it would have withstood court scrutiny (although admittedly we haven't seen the PA Supreme Court weigh-in yet) wouldn't have been a big challenge.  This goes to show the incompetence of our state legislature.

Act 192 isn't an uncommon act for Pennsylvania, and the supreme court would have to pull a surprising ""line in the sand"" bit of judicial activism to uphold the lower court's ruling.

My fiance would travel from state college to buffalo for work once a month and 219 to 80 to 322 to Harrisburg and 15 to Harrisburg are comparable in time.  I can tell you for sure rt15 from Watkins Glen to Harrisburg is 4 lanes the whole way with the occasional red lights. 219 is deff 2 lane for most of the way. Personally I prefer 219 due to it being slightly more scenic, but it's all I what you prefer"
Pennsylvania,3b2ggs,spoot0590,3,Thu Jun 25 14:11:29 2015 UTC,"This is spot on. 219 is very rural and 2-lane through the whole northern half of PA down to Ebensburg like stated in the other comment. 15 is a 4-lane highway starting in New York running the whole way to Harrisburg, with the exception of about 8 or so miles from Williamsport to Allenwood and the last couple miles just above Harrisburg that neck down to 2-lane.   15 intersects 322 maybe 15-20 miles north of Harrisburg and, depending on exactly where you're going, I'd say it would be best to take 322 for the last small leg of the trip.   Also, as said, 219 is a very scenic and beautiful drive. The northern section of 15 (above Williamsport) is quite beautiful as well, though."

Pennsylvania,3b2ggs,4G63Touareg,2,Thu Jun 25 22:40:23 2015 UTC,"I am not sure what it is like through New York, but I can sort of imagine what it could be like because the northern part of 219 is basically not a highway, more like how other routes in the state are, with some passing zones, pretty scenic drive.  Once you get into the middle of the state, towards Indiana/Ebensburg it becomes a highway down to where you would probably want to take the Pennsylvania Turnpike in Somerset to Harrisburg.

If we don't have the money and will to take care of them, we shouldn't be sending them in the first place.  I'm not totally on board with medical marijuana (I think recreational marijuana, which should also be legal, has a lot of advocates who have poisoned public policy by using it as a stepping stone, when we really just ought to be pushing money to research of it to ensure that it is safe for treatment of pathologies, outside of its obvious use as recreational drug) legalization just yet, but holy shit we can't keep doing this to vets."

Pennsylvania,3ayf56,TheGrim1,2,Wed Jun 24 20:33:17 2015 UTC,"ROFL laughing.  That's hilarious!!!!  Sadly, actual facts don't back it up.    Pennsylvania joins Alabama and Utah as the only states to have not modernized in some way.  Where is the rash of baby killings in the other 47 states and Washington DC?  The union ad is based on this newspaper article of drunk driving stats in NC.  Ironically, if you were to look at the same PA stats, underage fatal drunk driving in PA is 14 times higher than NC (774 in PA vs. 52 in NC).  Even adjusting for relative populations (12.8m in PA and 9.9m in NC), you find that underage drunk driving fatalities are still over 12x higher in PA.  So, if you really look at it, the PALCB and the Union kills more kids than privatization.  The Union spent over $300,000 on the ad.  Regardless of who sells the liquor (state or private), the same revenue will be raised...it's a sales tax and liquor tax.  So, whether state store or private grocery store, the revenue is still coming in.  25% of alcohol consumed in Pennsylvania is purchased across state lines at a loss to PA for a total over $180 million in sales and more than $40 million in tax dollars.  That's money not going to our schools and communities because of backwards thinking.  Studies done by both Public Financial Management, Inc. (PFM) and the PA's GBO found that privatizing the sale of alcohol return $100 million in sales to PA.  Why?  The union's big lie (other than baby killings) has been prices.  Union keeps saying that because of central buying, prices are held low for consumers.  But it's not true.  The same studies found in cross state pricing of over 60 different products, the only thing cheaper in PA is Boones.  If you're pro-union, you're anti-consumer.  But the real fallacy here is that someone has to lose.  Other states that have privatized are still union.  Unions can keep their cushy jobs and easy work, and consumers can have lower prices and better retail experience.  And we can take that $40m in extra tax revenue to lower the underage drunk driving rate created by the unions and the state stores.  Nobody has to lose for all of us to win."

It seems like a lot of effort, but the price savings are really worth it (handy that the PALCB posts the prices on the website so you can see how bad you're getting screwed).  I'm not from PA originally, so I didn't grow up under the fascist system here.  I'm accustomed to being able to buy beer and wine and spirits at the same store (a novel concept).

Personally, I've never seen an explanation of why all the additional test preparation is done by so many schools. It's said that schools must get kids to do well on the exam, but cramming for a test is a lousy long term strategy. Also, what actually happens if kids do poorly on the exam? The school is put in a particular category, but why does that matter? What actually happens as a result? One result is that parents might get the right to switch their kids to another school, which sounds fantastic, but is something that exists already in the form of charter schools. So is that what all this fuss is about? Preventing kids from going to charters?   As far as specific problems with individual questions, I'm certain there are issues.

Pennsylvania,3ajez1,Rhoelyn,5,Sat Jun 20 19:52:22 2015 UTC,"Malvern is on the edge of what is called the ""Main Line,"" which is kind of the ritzy suburbs of Philadelphia.  The US30 corridor has some of the more expensive real estate in the area.  I used to work in Exton, which is the next town west of Malvern.  It is a nice area, but expect rent to be expensive in rental communities in that area.  I live about 45 minutes north of Malvern, in Pottstown, and although it'd be a haul, you'd probably save a lot of money in rent costs to move away from the US30 corridor."

If you live in Philly you'd be in a reverse commute which is nice because the train will not be so crammed.   West Chester is a nice mini-Philly and is pretty close to Malvern. Chester County is pretty nice and IMO the only downside is the slightly indirect drive to Philly (a couple townships are top in the country I think).   I am very familiar with the area.

When you are checking for places to live go for one with central air, preferably with a heating pump.

Pennsylvania,3aj75m,pheonix100,8,Sat Jun 20 18:41:53 2015 UTC,"Why would they? He's right. A similar church shooting happened in 2012, and you probably never heard about it because one of the church goers was carrying a gun and stopped the shooter before he could go on a rampage. That didn't play into the media's fictional narrative about our ""massive gun problem"".  Ironically, instead of seeing this as proof that people should be allowed to defend themselves, these gun control groups are once again trying to politicize a tragedy and create more victims."
Pennsylvania,3aj75m,TooSunny,6,Sun Jun 21 15:24:51 2015 UTC,"The thing about mass shootings and legal CCW holders stopping them is that it is difficult to quantify if and how often a legal CCW carrier stops a potential mass shooting incident. I believe that mass shootings are stopped by CCW holders more often than suggested for these simple reasons:   Mass shootings are defined as three or more people killed in one area in one incident by one person Mass shootings often happen in gun free zones, so there are no legally carried guns there. It follows that legal gun carriers are not able to stop mass shooters in these zones because they are not welcome there Often a person will target one person to shoot first, then after that, the situation devolves into opportunistic shooting   If an offender starts a mass shooting incident in a ""freedom zone"" (i.e. where there are CCW holders), they may shoot one or two people before being dispatched by legal carriers. This would not be counted as a mass shooting since there are only 1 or two victims before the offender is stopped but they could have continued shooting.  In a gun free zone, there is nobody there to stop the mass shooting so the offender is free to continue the shooting after they killed the initial target."

Of course, the question is then, what to do about it - it's not like anyone really has the money to invest in overhauling sewage treatment system for 1/2 the state.   Consider also that we need to somehow come up with the money for all of our derelict bridges.  Our failing infrastructure is just a microcosm of the nation as a whole and it isn't going to be solved without spending on a scale that would be instant political suicide if admitted to."
Pennsylvania,3a16l0,Hillbl3,4,Tue Jun 16 14:09:22 2015 UTC,"The runoff from from farm land is a major issue and usually goes directly into our waterways. PA should start enforcing their regulations more thoroughly.   I think actually explaining the regulations and rationale to the Amish/Mennonites would go a long way as I doubt they are intentionally polluting their waterways. More than likely they are unaware of the impact certain farming practices have. We could also easily start planting around our waterways to help provide a buffer to soak up more of the runoff before it enters the waterways. These are relatively easy/cheap fixes.   Urban runoff is still an issue, but municipalities can help reduce this by assessing storm water fees based on the amount of storm water a property discharges (calculated based on the amount of impervious area). This is essentially a tax on the residents/businesses who are contributing most to the problem and financially motivates people to capture more storm water on their property."

See my previous comment about instant political suicide.  As for the Amish, by all means include them but, I somehow doubt they contribute as much to the problem as more industrial farms.  I'm not saying you're wrong I don't know what the actual numbers are or if they even exist.  My intuition is that the Amish don't own as much farmland as the Non-amish and even if they did their farming practices probably don't produce as much pollution as a modern industrial farm."

Pennsylvania,3a16l0,InhumanTarget,3,Wed Jun 17 00:09:16 2015 UTC,"Sadly, money is just part of the problem. I've personally witnessed excessive levels of ignorance making the whole problem worse.   A township in Cambria County has been on the DEP shit-list (pun intended) for most of the last decade for improper sewer module planning and resultant pollution. The state warned the township supervisors to get something done, or major fines were coming. Township hires and engineer, gets to work, and the residents complain so loudly and so vehemently that work grinds to a halt. The loudest voice among the residents even goes so far to get elected as a supervisor to make sure the project doesn't happen. To date, not one shovelful of dirt has been turned over.  Similarly, a borough in the same county is so over capacity in their treatment plant due to stormwater infiltration that they have to turn a valve and let untreated water and sewer go into the local streams every time it rains. DEP finally comes in and says, ""Okay, enough of this shit (again, pun intended),"" and the borough says they don't have enough money, so sewer bills are going up. Sewer bills will nearly double when the project is complete, but the state gives them a five million dollar grant to help fix the system, rewarding them for taking no action which was the authority's plan all along. The chairwoman admitted that, if they had fixed it properly 20 years ago, they wouldn't be getting the state's help now.   Ignorance."

Also, hanging something out your window is pretty dumb because you'd be in violation of Title 75 4524(b) - Obstruction on Side and Rear Windows. This minute violation, in conjunction with the fact that you refuse to open your window, would give the police running the checkpoint enough to legally make you step out of your vehicle and proceed further with a DUI investigation if they suspect you've had alcohol smell, bloodshot eyes, slow movements, off balance, etc.  Realistically, it's much easier to not drink and drive than to do this and wind up getting arrested.   Regardless of how you feel about checkpoints (I really have no opinion on them quite honestly), I'm not trying to argue here, I'm just trying to save someone from looking like an idiot and/or getting arrested."
Pennsylvania,39q03v,IAMABobby,2,Sun Jun 14 00:50:10 2015 UTC,"There are two types of checkpoints that PA police officers can set up: regulatory and DUI.    During a regulatory checkpoint the police are looking for license, insurance and registration. You will also be reminded to use a seatbelt if you are not wearing it.  You can't be cited for not using the seatbelt because that is a secondary violation.    At a DUI checkpoint the police are checking for DUI drivers.  The law allows for a brief interaction with the driver to determine sobriety.  The license in a bag trick is won't satisfy that requirement, and if you're sober, you're simply causing yourself more headaches than it's worth."

Checkpoint may be ineffective, but they've passed constitutional muster several times.  I wouldn't recommend being the one to try to turn case law around.    You're not presumed guilty. If you were, you'd be required to provide a breath or blood sample.  You'd be required to perform field sobriety tests. You'd be required to speak. None of those apply. You're required to roll down your window and be observed.  The stop must be brief and should be limited to detection of DUI.

Pennsylvania,39gne2,just_an_ordinary_guy,2,Thu Jun 11 16:27:16 2015 UTC,"I'm a fire fighter and water treatment operator, so I've got a little bit of experience with both sides of this.  As for the air monitoring, they weren't necessarily testing for the same things as water contamination.  Smoke itself is toxic, but what I think they meant is that no unusual toxins other than typical smoke.  As for the water, they knew from the start that they had a major hazmat incident.  They tried to dam and divert the contaminated water, but they had to use so much to put the fire out.  From day 1 they knew that contaminated water was working it's way into the ecosystem and tried to stop it.  The main concerns here, with the water quality, is nitrates, nitrites, and total organic carbon.  The problem with nitrates is that they break down into nitrites.  Nitrite is an intermediate step before turning into ammonia, which is then, I believe, harmlessly excreted from your body.  However, you can build up nitrites in your body which then oxidize the iron in your hemoglobin, which makes it unable to carry oxygen.  IIRC, it's not a deadly issue in children and adults, but it can be deadly to children.  As far as TOCs, they come from all kinds of things.  Normal organic matter isn't the issue, but some chemicals, fertilizers, and pesticides may increase TOC too.   The TL;DR: is that they knew it was coming, but didn't make a big deal about it until they needed to make a big deal about it.  They tried their hardest to contain it, but when they failed, they went through the proper channels.  Also, aquatic life is generally a lot more sensitive to this stuff too.  We only drink water, we don't live and ""breathe"" it.  The toxins of concern during the fire are generally a bit different from the toxins of concern entering the waterways.  Having a well tested if you live near the creek isn't a bad idea.  Surface water can influence ground water, and vice versa.  More than likely, few to none will have a contaminated well unless they live very close to the plant itself.  I don't know that area well enough to say.  I don't think that any coverup was attempted here.  They're just letting the public know more as they need to and as they learn of extent of this disaster themselves."

Well, when I have smoke from my wood fire, it doesn't contain the products of the chemicals stored at Miller. A chemical fire with nitrates, phosphates and who knows what else is substantially different from ""typical"" smoke.   One problem with nitrates is that they are VERY reactive, especially when burned. They combine with chlorine in the water, metals, and many other things. Can anybody say with certainty that the smoke carried away everything? After a chemical fire in Glen Rock, fish in a pond miles away died. All the fish. Maybe fish are more sensitive, but would you want your family playing on the grass that is coated with the byproducts of this chemical combustion? How do you clean up the land?  So far as the coverage, one mention for 2 nights, and one for 2 days does not constitute widespread coverage. Hell, a prostitution arrest in Harrisburg receives more mentions."
Pennsylvania,39gne2,mynameisalso,2,Fri Jun 12 17:51:07 2015 UTC,"I usually don't wear a tin-foil hat but this whole thing seems like a cover up.

Then when dead fish started turning up on Tuesday, they said the only danger was to aquatic life.  Finally yesterday they told people that if they have a well to have their water tested.   I don't even care about karma, please upvote this for visibility!   Those seem like logical steps.  Toxins in the air from the fire make sense.  They tried blocking the water using a retention pond but failed.  Dead fish are the result.  They can easily test city water, but since everyone has their own well it is a good safety precaution to have it checked.

Pennsylvania,393yio,mbz321,2,Tue Jun 9 22:18:43 2015 UTC,"The WW2 generation that lived in the coal region had a belief that they must send their kids to college - and a lot of them did, at a great sacrifice.  Their kids (and grandkids) got educated and realized that there isn't much future in the coal region and moved away.  The old timers are now dying off, leaving a lot of empty, cheap housing.  The big part of those belonging to the younger generations who stuck around migrated (white flight) out of the city into the surrounding rural areas.  Consider that Hazleton is also a small city, with public transportation, a buttload of $12/hr jobs, and is located a cheap bus ticket or 90 minute drive by car from NYC.  In the early 1900's, Hazleton's population was largely Catholic and the congregations were dwindling toward the end of the century, so the church was welcoming to any newcomers.  Back in the 1990's Rudy Guiliani 'cleaned up' NYC.  A lot of their undesirables moved westward to where they could find no-questions-asked work, not get hassled by the law, or stretch their relief checks further, due to Hazleton's low cost of living and being off the radar of law enforcement.  It is common now to see a house where there are a dozen or more males living there hells-kitchen-tenement-style.

So one family means the cousins, the family and its cousins forming a small group means an unrelated but friendly family has an incentive to come.

This will put more weight over the wheels and shouldgive better traction on snow/ice.  -Kitty litter. I'm serious. You can pour it around the wheels if you get stuck and it gives them something to grip. Doubles as weight, see above.  -You should always have jumper cables.

Keep a blanket and some non perishable food in your car (think granola bars).  Always keep a decent amount of fuel, etc.  A camp stove might be something to get, as the further out you live, the longer you might be out of power.  Careful about using it in the house. Carbon monoxide.  Not really sure what else to tell you.  We really don't get much abnormal weather. Nothing really extreme.

George Bivens and Ltc. Tim Mercer).   Brown greeted these folks by immediately asking for uniforms and PA police powers.  He never worked in PA as a police officer and has thin knowledge of PA laws.  He was advised that wearing the uniform would go over like a fart in church, but he persisted.  On a Sunday, he called one of the Capts.  and wanted his uniforms issued immediately.  That required a non-sworn employee and a Capt to have to come to work on OT to issue the uniform.  He also began carrying a firearm he didn't qualify with.  He then pressured legal staff to give him a positive legal opinion regarding his enforcement powers.    Then... He stopped behind a a Trooper who was conducting a traffic stop.  This is routine for Troopers of every rank.  If they see another cop on a traffic stop they stop to make sure no help is needed.  Brown turned this into some act of heroism never before done by someone of his rank.  That's a lie.  Brown then lied about the Troopers response to him.  One of the reasons the MVR wasn't released was because it refutes Brown's claim.    Additionally, he brought in a close ally from Maryland and created 100k/year job for him.  The job didn't exist before and it won't exist again.    Those early actions spread like wildfire and turned rank and file Troopers against him.  Then the highly respected Ltc.  Mercer retired.  He left because Brown wouldn't even discuss his future. At Ltc Mercers retirement gathering, Brown claimed in front of a large group of Troopers that he asked Mercer to stay on.  Those gathered knew that was a lie.  With that his fate was sealed.   He would never and can never have the respect of the lead.    The furor and foment that PSP retirees are causing is a proxy war on behalf of the active members.    Brown's predecessor, Frank Noonan, took the job humbly and slowly acclimated himself to the department and the members slowly warmed to him.  That is how you take over an organization.  Starting by throwing out edicts, alienating respected people and generally thinking your shit doesn't stink will be met with derision."

Not sure if you can say it's completely the same. it seems to have lost some of what made it interesting in the early 80s. There is now a Starbucks and a Dunkin' Donuts right across the street from each other. If the record/music memorabilia store you're thinking about was Now and Then (it was right next to the bridge to Lambertville), they are apparently long gone. I was happy to see my favorite bookstore in the entire world (Farley's) is still there and seemed to be thriving. There's still a lot of interesting quirky little places and a number of great restaurants, but overall I was disappointed to see it has become more upscale and corporate. It was still a lot of fun to visit and we had a great time.  EDIT: Spelling (of course)"

Not anymore.   There was a record/music memorabilia store that was clearly built in a residential home.   Flooded, not economically viable to reopen.   There was a toy store that had a lot of hand-made wooden toys.   Same.   There was an ice cream store that had a bizarre assortment of flavors; this is where I had my first taste of red bean ice cream.   Gerenser's.  Lost to IRS tax debt/mismanagement/numerous health violations.   Most of the stores seemed to be selling hand-made goods, especially clothes and jewelry.   Not so much anymore.  Many new shops selling junk and/or antiques, but there are a still a lot of good shops left.  Many of them are selling cheaper mass produced stuff as well because of pricing, but the real craftsmen still have their things around in the leather and art stores as well as in the mall."

Working in higher education over the past two decades I've witnessed this transition and while it has upsides and downsides, there is no denying that they are much more business like than they were 20 years ago.

One question for you /u/webauteur besides the main trailheads in Wellsboro and Jersey Shore is there anywhere else with easy access to the trail around Ansonia? Wellsboro is probably 20 miles from Gaines; Ansonia is maybe 7 so it would be more convenient.  For anyone reading here is the wiki for it http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pine_Creek_Rail_Trail  EDIT: Apparently there is an access point in Ansonia.

If you read the article, these sorts of incidents are becoming more and more common (for several reasons) and had nothing at all to do with him being a cop.    Veterans are angry, Sterner said, after a federal law about ""stolen valor,"" was struck down in 2012 and a meeker version passed in its place. Under the new law, few cases are being investigated or prosecuted against people who falsely claim military awards or service, Sterner said.  ""The veteran community, frustrated and upset, is saying, 'OK. We'll do it ourselves,' "" Sterner said. ""But what it's leading to is a bunch of hot heads. ... There's a lot of bullying going on in the community now. It's almost like hunting game, going out looking for phonies.""  In many cases, veterans or others who spot inconsistences are rewarded for their efforts.

In this case, he (Ford), got zero help from 2 cops. He got a scene made because the cop handled it all wrong, like a big feeling sob.  Asswipe cop should not be confronting people like that. Some people will escalate the situation, and in that case the cop is armed, he shoots somebody. Like many of the cases popping up around the country, somebody just going about their business gets harassed by a cop. The civilian is innocent of everything, a cop pisses him off, civilian is dead. Cop gets off. Idiot cops like this one are the ones who should be weeded out. It has everything with him being a cop. If I get in your face, you can give me an attitude adjustment.

The issue is the management and the employees. So again. That is a freedom of speech thing. The focus should be on the people. I don't see why the word is even being attacked.
Pennsylvania,38fz1h,Zain_Winters,4,Thu Jun 4 17:34:09 2015 UTC,http://www.r-word.org/r-word-effects-of-the-word.aspx  There is really no reason to use the word and it's almost always used in a derogatory way. It's easy to say that there's nothing wrong with the word when it doesn't necessarily effect you. I am guilty of saying it sometimes and I have to catch myself because I know it is hurtful.
Pennsylvania,38fz1h,BeesForKnees,3,Thu Jun 4 17:34:36 2015 UTC,"It's not a freedom of speech issue. Not even remotely close. Why?  The Bill of Rights contains the rights of the citizens with respect to the government and to government interference. If the local/state/federal government passed a law that made it a misdemeanor to say the word ""retard,"" that would be a violation of the first amendment.  Since Applebee's is--last I checked--a private business, and not a governmental entity, they are allowed to reward/punish speech as they see fit (within certain bounds.) To spout off about freedom of speech makes no more sense than to say that it would violate freedom of religion for FedEx to fire a delivery worker who tries to proselytize at those to whom he/she is delivering packages. Private company. Negative actions of worker. Worker fired.  As for the employees, the issue is the manager who said, ""If you don't like it--leave."" Workplace harassment is anything that would have the reasonable expectation of offending someone. If the manager wasn't such a fuck-up, they would have reprimanded and written up the employees who used the language before the server in question even had a chance to voice his disapproval. Just because someone doesn't explicate that they're offended doesn't mean they weren't, and they shouldn't have to vocalize their discomfort to get the manager to do his/her job. That particular manager has no business being in any sort of supervisory position."

Pennsylvania,38i4vf,pheonix100,3,Thu Jun 4 11:03:19 2015 UTC,"I went to high school with the guy. He was always a little odd in that cute-but-needs-guidance way. He was in and out of trouble a lot since his juvenile years and frequently sported an ankle monitor for whatever flavor-of-the-month shit he got into. I know it's tragic and unfortunate, but part of me is sad that it came to this. This is the second person I've known to have died in as many weeks, both were younger than me.  For those of you who don't have access to the local newspaper here's the article from today's Press Enterprise:   SALEM TWP. — Jennifer Bower pleaded for court protection from ex-boyfriend Shawn Andrew Kishbaugh, saying he had threatened to kill her.  On Wednesday, both of them were found dead of gunshot wounds in her home in what police say was a murder-suicide.  Officers found the bodies the day before a court hearing that could have made Bower’s temporary protection-from-abuse order permanent.  Township Police Chief Robert Kishbaugh said police were called to 239 Bowers Road at about 8:01 a.m. after a third party reported a domestic incident there.  Officers arrived by 8:04 a.m. and gained entry minutes later, said Officer Fred Westover.  Inside, they found the two bodies.  Bower, 35, was not staying at the house, but returned for the sake of her child, Chief Kishbaugh said.  The boy, listed in court papers as 7 years old, was not at the house at the time of the shooting, said the chief.  Officers did not say who shot whom as of press time last night.  ‘Hitting and choking me’  Just a week earlier, on May 27, Bower came home from tanning around 11 a.m. to find Shawn Kishbaugh in her house, she said in her court filing. He had moved out to stay with someone on East Third Street in Berwick, and he hadn’t been invited back, she wrote.  “He was screaming, telling me I needed to be with him,” she wrote. “He started hitting and choking me.”  She begged him to stop, and he finally did. That’s when she left for work and called police.  It wasn’t the first time he had attacked her, she alleged.  She once had to jump from a moving car, because Shawn Kishbaugh, who was driving, told her he was going to crash it and kill them both, she said.  He tried to burn her face with an iron, broke her nose, and punched her in the head, face and body, Bower said.  Once, she said he slammed her head against a car, splitting her eye open.  He choked her numerous times until she passed out, she added.  Guns forbidden  Based on her plea, she was granted a temporary PFA that went into effect May 28.  The order required Shawn Kishbaugh to hand over any firearms that he owned. However, it was unclear Wednesday if the order had been served.  Bower said he habitually kept a sawed-off shotgun handy.  She also filed paperwork to make the protection order permanent, barring Shawn Kishbaugh from the home they once shared; stalking or harassing her or her son; and having contact with her or parents Connie and John Bower, who lived next door.  The hearing on that request was scheduled for today in Luzerne County Court.  Criminal history  It wasn’t the first time Shawn Kishbaugh, 28, had been accused of attacking a former girlfriend.  He was out on bail while awaiting trial in Columbia County on charges that include aggravated assault and burglary. He allegedly cut a window screen to break into the Scott Township apartment of a former girlfriend in July 2013, then began choking her in her bed.  In April 2011, he was arrested near Wilkes-Barre after allegedly violating a restraining order. The Citizens’ Voice reported at the time that he showed up at an ex-girlfriend’s workplace despite the court order forbidding contact. Then he turned up on her porch at 3:15 a.m.  His lengthy criminal history also includes a 21-day to 23-month sentence for teaming with a juvenile in an attempt to rob a man in Berwick; two days to six months in prison for drunken driving; 30 days to 12 months for criminal mischief in Luzerne County; six to 12 months for burglary in Hanover Township; and assorted other crimes.  He was still on both parole and probation, Bower wrote."

The police are just bellyaching because a loophole may get closed.

Switching to a mileage based tax/fee ought to be considered as a stopgap measure.  When it comes to school funding I'm not so sure that PA has a tax revenue problem as much as it has a spending problem.  We have 500 school districts in the Commonwealth.  That means 500 administrations and all of the non-teaching costs that come with them.  How much could be saved by consolidating those 500 districts down to say 300?

Pennsylvania of article  Ages of consent in North America:       [original research?]  The de jure (in name) age of consent in Pennsylvania is 16 years of age for sexual consent,  but a corruption of minors statute against adults corrupting the morals of minors under 18 years of age exists which makes the de facto (in fact) age of consent in Pennsylvania 18 years of age. However, the corruption of minors statute only applies to perpetrators 18 years of age and older, so it is legal for minors 16-17 to have sex with each other but not with a partner 18 or older. [citation needed]  Teenagers aged 13, 14 and 15 may or may not be able to legally engage in sexual activity with partners who are less than 4 years older. Such partners could not be prosecuted under statutory rape laws, but may be liable for other offenses, even when the sexual activity is consensual.

Pennsylvania,381vhu,nein_stein,1 point,Mon Jun 1 23:04:00 2015 UTC,"Age of consent is 16, though I don't know what that means. Is this primarily illegal because she was his teacher?  If the age was 16 like in other countries would this still be illegal because she's a teacher?"
Pennsylvania,381vhu,DoctorSteve,3,Mon Jun 1 16:27:30 2015 UTC,"Yes, that's exactly it.  She was convicted of ""Institutional Sexual Assault,"" which is a 3rd degree felony.  Basically, as a teacher she's in a position of trust and isn't allowed to have sex with her students even if they're 16 or older.  The victim was 17 at the time so she could not be charged with statutory rape."
Pennsylvania,381vhu,Robert_A_Bouie,2,Mon Jun 1 20:46:27 2015 UTC,Does it say she was his teacher? I thought she was just a teacher. I've seen other cases like this where they don't see a difference between it.  I am not in favour of students and teachers banging. It's extremely inappropriate. But I want to stress why I feel it's not appropriate. It wouldn't be appropriate in college either (assuming they were a current student/teacher. After their class ended would be fine. In fact a friend of mine married one of her former high school teachers.)
Pennsylvania,381vhu,DoctorSteve,3,Mon Jun 1 20:53:37 2015 UTC,"I said ""her"" students and I was probably wrong about that, as the article doesn't say that the victim was a student of hers.  The statute doesn't require a student-teacher relationship though.  Any employee of the school district, whether it be a teacher, principal, janitor or even a volunteer could be charged with Institutional Sexual Assault if they have sexual contact with a student of the school.  You can read the statute here."

Pennsylvania,381vhu,mynameisalso,2,Mon Jun 1 19:16:13 2015 UTC,I had sex with a 32 yo when I was 15 I loved it.  That may or may not be his thoughts I don't know.  I even had sex again with her when I was in my late twenties.  So saying a life is ruined based on him being 17 is bs.
Pennsylvania,381vhu,DoctorSteve,2,Mon Jun 1 19:29:28 2015 UTC,Your life could be ruined as a 25 year old with a 25 year old. I mean there's nothing inherently life ruining about sex.  If the issue is teacher/student during a school year I can understand. But I mean the kid is 17 he's not going to get more mature in under one year. Maturity comes from experiences anyway.
Pennsylvania,381vhu,mynameisalso,2,Mon Jun 1 19:32:30 2015 UTC,Exactly.  So saying his life is ruined based on fucking an adult is hard to believe.  It takes a lot to ruin a life.  Look at that girl who had acid thrown on her face for going to school.     But now his life is ruined based on having sex a few months early.
Pennsylvania,381vhu,DoctorSteve,1 point,Mon Jun 1 19:35:38 2015 UTC,"Oh no, he could totally have a traumatic sexual experience having sex with an older person.   He could also have a traumatic sexual experience with someone his own age.   Or by getting lost.  Anything can become something bad. Or an opportunity for growth. Or a positive experience. There's no way to justify ""this shouldn't happen because it could potentially be bad"".  14 year olds? Too young. 16 year olds? Iffy, border lineish. But 17 and 18 are real close. We're fine with high school girls doing porn. I'm pretty sure that's a website. But at 17, it could be traumatic?  It's stupid. I understand the law has to be drawn somewhere, but with an age of conset set at 16, I think the law is already drawn.  Someone abusing a place of power to get sex, that can be an issue, one beyond traumatic experience potential. But this idea that a 17 year old will be scarred for life by having sex with an older woman, that's stupid."

It's where you would go to not do anything.  No judgement there at all, it's a great thing if it's what  you really want.   You mention Hershey, by rough estimate I would put that at a solid four hour drive each way and I'm pretty sure the park is closed by the first week of November.  Chocolate world will be open but is in no way worth that sort of trip.  Same deal with Knobels, too far into winter.    What you could do is stop on you way to something else or build some more into it, for instance go to a Hershey bears (minor league hockey) game and chocolate world to close out an evening in the southern midstate.  Highly recommend he bears though; I've never had a lousy time and tickets are cheap for what it is.  There are a few solid breweries for drinks/food in the capital area, not to mention the capital itself.  Pine creek gorge was mentioned, which is gorgeous, but in the same boat as Cooks, far from everything.  The Poconos I could see as a legitimate single destination.  Penns cave is cool, you tour by boat and is he only cave I'm aware of that you do that.  As for fishing pa is probably best known for its trout fishing, which you would hard pressed to get far away from.  Raystown is known for its striper fishing if you prefer lakes and bass, but I have no idea what that will be like in November.   There are some charters that you could call that I'm sure would help you more.  Is there anything you like to do, hiking, biking, kayaks, horseback, hunting, gambling, cities, shows, nightlife, museums, zoo, sports, anything?"
Pennsylvania,37wjwo,Hillbl3,2,Sun May 31 03:59:30 2015 UTC,"Wow, thank you for all the information. We are going to spend a few days doing attractions then head up to Cooks Forest to relax.   That is sad about Hershey. I did not realize it was closed then. But at least it sounds like there is a lot there.   You mentioned winter, does it snow that early in November in PA? Just want to make sure we are prepared.   Fishing for bass and trout is perfect. I actually grew up fishing so I would be joining him. It was just his one thing he really wanted time for during vacation.   We like museums, zoos, horseback, history, arts, etc."
Pennsylvania,37wjwo,Hillbl3,1 point,Sun May 31 16:30:00 2015 UTC,"There are other attractions at Hershey for sure.  They have a ZooAmerica specializing in North American animals.  I think somebody else mentioned the hotel.  There is a website with all the 'official' attractions.    Winter in PA is a total crapshoot.  It can not snow until February or bury us in October.  On the average I would say it should be a non-issue for the beginning of November.  There may be some snow, but unlikely to be enough for any sort of winter sports or even enough to completely cover the ground.  Just enough to affect driving at night.   If you really like arts and museums, you would be remiss not to visit the Museum of Art in Philadelphia.  Hell, I don't even like art and that place is AMAZING.  There are also plenty of history destinations in Philly, what with being the national capital for a while and all.  The walk down Kelly drive from the museum is typically pleasant as well with some low key sights/statues.    Also in the general vicinity of Hershey (about 40? minutes away) is Gettysburg with the battlefield which is history galore.  Basically the art museum and battlefield are two legit PA only attractions that fall into the 'everyone should do this at least once' category.  As I said before Raystown is some of the best bass fishing in the state I'm aware of (during the summer anyway) and is sort of on the way from the Hershey area to Cooks.  Trout fishing you can do in just about an stream or creek you can throw a stone across."

It has a lot of neat things to see and do but you have to drive for hours to find anything. I haven't explored quite as far west as Cooks Forest. But if you head north east you can reach Coudersport which is a quaint small town. There is a ruined Victorian mansion on Main Street which looks like a perfect haunted house. Then further east on U.S. 6 is the Pennsylvania Grand Canyon which is very popular. It has two state parks with overlooks and hiking trails. The Pennsylvania Lumber Museum is also worth visiting for its recreation of a lumber camp.  South east you could visit a few caves but that would still be a long drive just for that. Indian Caverns and Lincoln Caverns are fairly close together and Penn's Cave is east of State College.  The Poconos used to be a popular place for honeymoons before international travel made it easier to visit more exotic destinations. The Poconos still has many luxury resorts and outdoor recreation facilities. You could visit Bushkill Falls, Columcille Megalith Park, Deer Head Inn for jazz, and Hickory Run State Park has a neat boulder field."

I'll speak to Conshy as it's closer and IMHO a better place to live.   If you can afford the higher rents Conshohocken is a good town. Plenty of bars and restaurants and less than 15 minutes from campus. The town has undergrads, grads, and young working professionals who are always looking for a housemate to fill a room. Rentals and rooms go damn quick so you have to be aggressive.   Lead time on private rentals and rooms is usually a month or two at most. You can always rent at the condos in town (river walk at millennium, spring mill apartments, or even londonbury) but you're going to pay a premium for these places. You can rent a room in a house for 500-700/month compared to a condo for 1400+/month. All depends on your budget.  Local chain grocery stores are Giant and Weis, there is also Whole Foods and Wegmans which sell higher quality goods at a premium.

The Repubs kept saying ""If only you'd do X, maybe you'd get some R votes. As the Dems caved, the Rs moved the goalposts. In the end, you had a flawed bill that was intentionally subverted by Rs.   Also, why do you say it was not constitutional? The US Supreme Court, which rules on matters of constitutionality, has said it passes muster.

The Supreme Court ruled on the constitutionality of the individual mandate, not on the bill a a whole."
Pennsylvania,37l7vp,Snedeker,2,Fri May 29 13:04:39 2015 UTC,"Revisionist history is what Repubs are peddaling. For instance, they want to make it sound like Obamacare was something foisted without negotiations. Really? A bill that was introduced in July of 2009 and negotiated for most of a year with Max Baucus in the Senate taking the lead for that side. Didn't happen? That is revisionism. Republican added 160 amendments, trying to kill it. Don't remember that? See, I was alive and thinking in 2009, and remember it well, Here is a synopsis of the passage of Obamacare.  https://progressiveandproud.wordpress.com/2013/10/05/another-acaobamacare-myth-no-negotiation-between-democrats-and-republicans-on-acaobamacare/  So far as the constitutionality of it, don't you think the Repubs would have sued for anything they could, but that the individual mandate was their best arrow in the quiver? Do you really think that the Party of No would let slip an opportunity to get rid of Obamacare? They voted almost 40 times to get rid of it, in spite of the fact they knew the bills they wasted their time on would need the president's signature to enact. All for show, they spent how much time and money while the country muddled through the Bush recession."
Pennsylvania,37l7vp,tahonte,0,Fri May 29 14:25:42 2015 UTC,"All you did was link to an article full of misinformation. Look at some NYT articles from the same time period. Republicans were forced to ""offer"" amendments  because they were shut out of the negotiations.    The acting committee chairman, Senator Christopher J. Dodd, Democrat of Connecticut, had made clear from the start that his panel would bend little when it came to the top priorities of Senate Democrats and the Obama administration, including on a provision to create a government-run health insurance plan to compete with private insurers that Republicans insisted was a deal-breaker.  In the end however, Republicans held their ranks. In his closing statement, Senator Michael B. Enzi of Wyoming said that Republicans had been forced to offer more than 100 amendments to the bill because Democrats had largely shut them out of the drafting process. And he said that the $1 trillion, 10-year cost of the measure would simply drive the nation further into debt, while denying many Americans the choices for health care providers that they now enjoy.   Maybe ""ProgressiveAndProud"" is not as unbiased a source as you seem to think that it is."
Pennsylvania,37l7vp,Snedeker,2,Fri May 29 15:24:47 2015 UTC,"I'm not claiming it doesn't have a slant, but the facts are what it says. I understand you don't want to believe what the facts are. I understand that you want to accept what Republican Enzi says as truth. what I don't understand is your lack of citations, and your not remembering the long drawn out process drafting the bill was, and calling it unconstitutional. The bill was passed without Repub. support because they decided from day one that their first priority was to make Obama a failed, one term president. They had no intention of ever voting for any bill the Dems proposed. Ever."
Pennsylvania,37l7vp,tahonte,0,Fri May 29 17:59:45 2015 UTC,"So the Republicans hated it. They fought tooth and nail against its passage. They put forth a hundred amendments to try to kill it. No support at all from the Republicans. A Republican was elected to fill Ted Kennedy's seat for the express purpose of putting it down. Not a single one voted for it. It was rammed down the throat of the public by Democrats using unprecedented legislative tactics, over the howling objection of the Republicans.   But when the court rules against it, somehow the Republicans are responsible for its content?"
Pennsylvania,37l7vp,Snedeker,2,Fri May 29 18:49:07 2015 UTC,"Well, first you said it was revisionist to suggest the Dems even negotiated. Now you say the negotiations were pointless, and on that we agree. No sense in arguing. You believe the Repubs were not responsible for any of it. The fact that the would get the Dems to change parts of it. hinting that if the Dems just did X, they might support it. When the Dems did X (spineless pols often are movable), the Repubs said, well, if you just do Y, we might vote for it. And so on. I think the Dems, having 60 senators, should have just passed a bill to their liking, ignoring the dishonest Republican tactics. Then the bill might have been more reasonable, without exemptions for all manner of things.  When has the supreme ruled against it? Lower, much more political courts have ruled against various parts, but almost all parts have stood the test. I expect the next ruling will continue the streak.  I predict that in a few years, the same mentality that howled against social security will accept Obamacare. There are still many on the Republican fringe who rail against socialistic programs like SS, but most Americans no longer want to repeal that."

Assume for a second that Pennsylvania produces all of the world's gas, and that the 5% tax is passed entirely onto the consumer. If this were the case, it would raise gas prices by 15 cents per McF. The average Pennsylvania home consumes about 18 MBtU's, which works out to be about 18.5 McF. Therefore, under the scenario we described, the average family in Pennsylvania will see a tax rise of $2.78. Actual costs would be lower since PA only makes up a fraction of the Natural Gas market."

Pennsylvania,36ynlj,autowikibot,2,Sat May 23 06:52:29 2015 UTC,"Keystone (architecture):       A keystone is the wedge-shaped stone piece at the apex of a masonry vault or arch, which is the final piece placed during construction and locks all the stones into position, allowing the arch to bear weight.    Although a masonry arch or vault cannot be self-supporting until the keystone is placed, the keystone experiences the least stress of any of the voussoirs, due to its position at the apex.  Old keystones can decay due to vibration, a condition known as bald arch.  In a rib-vaulted ceiling, keystones may mark the intersections of two or more arched ribs. For aesthetic purposes, the keystone is sometimes larger than the other voussoirs, or embellished with a boss. Mannerist architects of the 16th century often designed arches with enlarged and slightly dropped keystones, as in the ""church house"" entrance portal at Colditz Castle (see image). Numerous examples are found in the work of Sebastiano Serlio, a 16th-century Italian Mannerist architect.

OP, /u/michaelconfoy pulled the same verbal stunt one week ago in this post also claiming the ground had sunk.  I can only locate web pages using the same or substantively simailr phrasing, but nothing to substantiate this claim of sinking."
Pennsylvania,36nujb,joedonut,3,Thu May 21 03:57:38 2015 UTC,It is not a stunt.  That is the exact title from the Library of Congress.

Pennsylvania,36nujb,KnowWhataWawaIs,1 point,Thu May 21 04:47:08 2015 UTC,I grew up about 10 miles from this town. It's the coal region the ground is all very unstable. I can't place exactly where this picture was taken but I can assure you the streets are really like this.
