animation,3e3bj3,Uberhipster,5,Tue Jul 21 18:50:21 2015 UTC,What inspired the story? Great work BTW
animation,3e3bj3,ferretface99,4,Tue Jul 21 19:40:17 2015 UTC,It's actually an adaptation of a short story by Ben Loory also called the duck. I first heard it read by him on this American life. It's in his book of short stories Stories For Nighttime and Some for the Day. Fantastic modern fairytales!
animation,3e3bj3,cheatisnotdead,5,Tue Jul 21 19:42:18 2015 UTC,"I love the mood and atmosphere. The story is a little out there, but it felt so good watching it. What programs did you use?"
animation,3e3bj3,cheatisnotdead,6,Tue Jul 21 22:08:55 2015 UTC,"Aw that makes me so happy! It was always a little stretch of a concept haha, I'm just glad if it worked!   Backgrounds in Photoshop. Animation and character colouring in TVPaint. 3D reference in Maya. Comp'ing in AE. And the blood from a human heart."
animation,3e3bj3,Not_a_Stranger,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:38:49 2015 UTC,That sounds like a great workflow to me. Any reason you chose TVPaint over other programs like ToonBoom? I don't see many TVPainters these days.
animation,3e3bj3,Archarzel,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:46:32 2015 UTC,"Toonboom is Vector animation where as TVPaint is bitmap, what that means is TB lines are actually ""digital"" (it's all digital but you get me haha), and that means there is a bit of a disconnect with the line. TVPaint is totally sweet and uses bitmap tech, like photoshop. So it means you can create these gnarly custom brushes and have immediate response from the line. It limits it with the digital manipulation, BUT good you know? Force me to use traditional 2D animating workflow, so I just draw MORE frames.  All that being said TVPaint is so wonderfully french. So sometimes it seems illogical in it's UI, or behaves in strange ways. But the thing is stable as hell, and has so much hidden under the hood if you wan't to use it. But like I said, I just use it as a canvas and try not to do too much. That's when I go into After Effects and do too much and filter fuck it haha. If I could do it all by hand I would!"
animation,3e3bj3,NeonBatman,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:53:25 2015 UTC,"Good response! Though I feel I didn't frame my question quite right.  I used TVPaint for a while until I ran up against it's limits. Then I switched to ToonBoom, which while it solved the problems I had (problems with working in bitmap), it lacked the tactile feel I wanted.  But the new Toon Boom Animate 3 (and now Harmony Advanced) has hugely adjustable pencil tools that I find to be the most satisfying solution I've found so far, giving the flexibility of vector, but a lot (not all, but way more then I would expect) of options to give the stroke a more hand-drawn feel, from pencil and charcoal and even weirder stuff.  So the answer was that the things that turned me off to TVP are the things that you have found endearing, and obviously you do great work in the program. I guess I was trying to ask a 'do you prefer bitmap or vector' kind of question, but did so poorly. So I guess I don't really have a point other then ""Shine on you crazy diamond"""

animation,3e4u0z,DummiesBelow,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:44:06 2015 UTC,"After Effects or Anime Studio will let you make a puppet out of your art and interpolate the inbetween frames.  Anime Studio has Illustrator import but you're better off exporting as PNG and animating it that way or redrawing your character within it.  After Effects you can use the puppet tool but I'm not sure the import functions, it has been a while.  Toonboom can also do cut out style animation."

animation,3e47mw,resplendentradish,1 point,Wed Jul 22 00:15:48 2015 UTC,I see I thought you just didn't want to draw the characters at all.   Look into After Effects but you may have to create your own assets depending on your needs. It has many functions but doesn't excel in making all of them easy to use. Google something like 'motion graphics after effects' and see if it's something you could use for your project.

Your experiment rendered you a two minute film, and you can do the same but to a simple short story or an idea conveyed effectively. Such an application would make a lot of people happy and inspired. Also, pay attention on how you apply sound to it. I could say music only, as long as you get the rights, or music with sound fx, or just sound effects.

If you have proffessional experience animating that could get you in the door, if not, just keep working on reel and apply EVERYWHERE.

For example when you turn a corner and see pedestrians run by you and say one trips and then gets back up and keeps running.

Here's what he had to say:   “The video was made using a combination of digital 3D models, drawing on paper, traditional 2D animation, rotoscoping, and digital 2D animation. The most complex part of the production was used for the main character and the spaceship, where 3D models were built and animated and then the frames were individually printed out on paper. These images were then redrawn in ink (rotoscoped), and scanned back into the computer to be coloured and used in combination with full 2D digital animation. So, the finished animation is a custom blend of 2D, 3D, digital and analogue techniques."""

I keep meaning to enter, but always run out of time.   What are your thoughts on TV Paint vs animating in Photoshop? I've never used TV Paint, but seems like it's probably better than PS."
animation,3dva9u,marvinchagler,2,Sun Jul 19 23:34:58 2015 UTC,"Thanks! I'm always a bit the same, always leave it to the last minute.   TVPaint is much better set up for focusing on movement, ie setting up your keys, and working on the timing and spacing. It's so easy to adjust this as you go and makes it seamless to do rough animation. Photoshop is better for the finish. Its timeline is really fiddly, whether it's with video layers or individual layers, and I feel that distracts from getting the animation and movement nice. TVPaint has a lot of similar blending modes and features as Photoshop, but Photoshop handles masks a bit better. Ideally I would use TVPaint to get the rough animation, and then Photoshop to clean/colour. But it adds the extra step of exporting/importing a sequence, which makes it hard to go back and change things. The colouring was pretty simple in this one, so I just stayed in TVPaint.   Having said that, the painting and inking in TVPaint is great, and you can do some cool things, and it has lots of preset brushes that look realistic. But for me, layer organisation and masks are really essential."
animation,3dva9u,JazzaSpores,2,Mon Jul 20 00:49:40 2015 UTC,"Hey, were there any specific tutorials that helped when you got started with TVPaint? There doesn't seem to be many tutorials out there..."

Is it a ball walking and shooting something? Or is it the lower body of a human getting pushed back by something?  Second feedback I have is to start off simpler. Isolate one motion, it's actually much harder than you might think to transition between different types of motion! Start by a looping walkcycle, or a bouncing ball."

animation,3dutre,YOYOCOOLC27,3,Sun Jul 19 18:14:07 2015 UTC,"The tail needs more overlap. You sort of have the right idea, you just need to follow-through the entire wave motion of the tail. Don't forget the middle-part should arrive before the end of the tail! It would be a good idea to animate a pendulum, just to simplify it a bit and really nail the wave motion."
animation,3dutre,steeenah,3,Sun Jul 19 19:57:13 2015 UTC,"I think you're looking at the drag the wrong way. It seems like you're thinking that the trail will go through every step of the body, but that's not true. The tail is going to try to stay where it is until it is pulled somewhere else. I don't see what's pulling the tip into a curly queue after the squirrel has left the ground. Remember with the tail that long you might get two ""phases"" of drag,  where the tip lags behind the bulk of the tail."

animation,3dutre,SecretlyAnonymous,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:28:14 2015 UTC,"Before you worry too much about the tail, take another look at the body. Each bounce starts out fine (except for one frame at the start of each where the squirrel moves straight up instead of forward), but then the body seems to lose or even reverse its momentum just before it hits the ground.  Imagine a person hopping forward. Just as their legs will trail behind them at the outset of each jump, so should the legs lead the way at the end of it. Here's a quick sketch of what I'm talking about (the red is the starting pose, followed by green, black, and blue).  Another thing to keep an eye on is the spacing of the body between frames. The spacing should be smallest (the body should move the least between frames) at the height of the jump, and it should be greatest right before the body hits the ground. The difference is often very subtle, but it's always important: for example, the bottom of the squirrel's body in your animation moves slightly more as it leaves the peak of each arc than it does between the last two frames before it touches the ground.  This is already longer than I intended, so I'll leave it at that. Hope it helps!"
animation,3dtzi6,RyuHayabusa2015,9,Sun Jul 19 13:18:56 2015 UTC,"Many reasons. It adds an extra layer of control for the director in terms of the visual style and beauty of the animation. Color grading is about finnesse and subtle detail, the colors within a shot have to harmonise, which is something hard to control when individually adding color to each cell or texturing each object. When color grading, you have to look at the colors in the entire shot as a whole.  In addition, the colors of a scene compliment the emotional content of it. For example, in a 2D film, if you have a character and a set that in the first scene is happy and sunny, then the second scene sad and rainy, would it make more sense to color every cell in a happy pallet, then make another sad pallet, or use one base pallet and then color grade each shot to make it subtly more happy or sad? The second option would not only take less time, but make the film look more consistent and emotionally powerful.  In 3D, there are a slew of things that affect the colors. The lights, the texture of the objects, the shading of the objects (e.g. is it shiny, bumpy, or see-through like glass?), rendering and compositing, visual effects, etc. On an industrial 3D pipeline, each of those aspects will be managed by a different team of people, and you need to have a final person color grade to improve the beauty and emotional quality of the film."

animation,3dtzi6,alextbrown4,2,Sun Jul 19 14:57:36 2015 UTC,"Well, English is not my first language. here is what I meant,  They show images like this in color grading, by shooting in less contrast, you preserve more details, then in your final editor, you can adjust the levels to enhance the colors. This make sense in camera as you want to preserve as much details as possible then fluctuate as necessary.  Now in animation, you already have ultimate control of anything, you want the flower to pop out? Increase the saturation of the flower, done, no need of any post production.  So my final question is, why does animation especially 3d animation needs color grading as the artist ultimately can do whatever he want in the animation software itself?"
animation,3dudaa,xXDigital_DecayXx,2,Sun Jul 19 15:49:12 2015 UTC,"Lag comes from a lot of places. I get lag with my Wacom Intuos Pro when I use it on my laptop because my laptop is a bit of a piece of junk. If I'm sitting on 16,000x9000 pixels, I get lag. Shit happens.   That said, if you're going to pay money for a Huion tablet, you'd might as well go for their monitor-tablets like GT-190 or GT-220. They're about the same price as an Intuos Pro, but they display what you're drawing on the tablet like a Cintiq.  Spend more money, get a better tablet. And if you've got a kid in the house, watch your pens. Turns out, tablet pens and coffee are not good friends, no matter how many times my toddler tries to introduce them. ^_^"

The build quality on the huion is obviously not as good, but at the end of the day it worked, had pressure sensitivity, everything I wanted at the time. The main difference between them was that the intuos was nicer plastic, felt nicer, looked nicer. In terms of my output it was almost exactly the same, but I was a student and lets be honest if you're learning do you need a $500 professional tablet? probably not, it's not going to make your drawings better.

Also I looked at OP's post history, he's 15, he has made a good choice for where he's at. I hope he goes to college to study Animation if that's what he wants, and that would be a good time to invest in a wacom."

animation,3dudaa,popculturalreverence,-7,Mon Jul 20 02:31:18 2015 UTC,"It's so adorable you're concerned over a 50 dollar tablet! I don't really know much about anything other than Wacoms, but as a general principle, a 50 dollar tablet is going to have problems. Already the cheapest Wacom tablet is almost 150% more expensive, and it's only half the size.  Wacom tablets are without a doubt a premium product and I'm pretty sure the industry standard - so I would expect anything cheaper to suffer from some performance issues and a lack of customer support.  Fortunately, even if $50 is a big deal to you right now, getting a somewhat workable tablet for 50 bucks is actually pretty good. Personally, even though that strikes me as decent value I'd recommend you to shell out more for the little Wacom Intuos Pen.  I can almost guarantee that it'll be a better product, and when you're working on a tablet and not a display, the size of your tablet isn't as important as the size of your monitor. It's designed to be a starter tablet anyway - not to mention this little thing is very portable. I used to have the equivalent starter Wacom years ago, but it seems they've got these new Chic ones out now."
animation,3dudaa,theawesomepawsomes,2,Sun Jul 19 16:09:10 2015 UTC,I happen to have a intous pen and touch. I also happen to have used a friends monoprice tablet.  Not everyone has the luxury of trying both but have. The monoprice one was better in quality and in function than the intous. Quit being a snob to people who don't have lots of money and are new to animation.
animation,3dudaa,popculturalreverence,-1,Sun Jul 19 19:09:37 2015 UTC,"Holy moly dude,  Not trying to be a snob. I didn't even know a $50 tablet exists. They average from 800-3000 for a tablet worth investing in if you're a professional. Anything 500 and under would be considered aimed at hobbyists or amateur artists. I haven't bought one in 5 years or so - I'm just pointing out a couple of decisions I would consider when buying.  This one is $50 for a 10 x 5 inch. Wacom has one for $120 3x6. Wacom is industry standard, at least I've never met an artist who doesn't use a Wacom but that could just be me, who knows. I haven't been able to find any reviews online of a tablet that model, Huion must be quite offbrand.  What is a traditional issue with cheaper offbrand products? Inferior products and a lack of infrastructure to support things like good customer support? Not being a snob, it's basic economics.  In my mind, if you're using a tablet with no display, the size is not of great importance because your eyes are on your screen, not your tablet. If you have a display tablet like a cintique, then size actually does help a lot because that's what you're looking at. Considering size is not in my experience of great factor, if you can afford a little bit more for something I assume OP will be spending a lot of time with, I personally see benefit to it.  I just tried to give a helpful opinion. Nobody else had answered this thread...I didn't intend to be patronizing, it was just like cute, breaking in his tabletginity etc.."

To try and clear things up: I actually suggested he go for a $120 tablet, if it were possible. At no point did I suggest he spend anything over that, but I used the average value of a tablet to justify the somewhat minimal extra expense.  I didn't say he should go for what professionals use, I said professionals use this brand - therefore it's trustworthy. By contrast, literally zero professional reviews exist on this product. It's not untrustworthy, but there's nothing to say it's good either.  I have no clue why all you're doing is trying to pick apart my argument incoherently, pretty much every time I try to post on reddit some retard makes an attempt at it.  You've just completely misread my post, multiple times.  Don't bother replying. You've probably already started misconstruing my words, yet again.

animation,3dudaa,popculturalreverence,2,Mon Jul 20 09:34:49 2015 UTC,"Dude, you are just completely turning my words to shit - all I said was I personally see reason to spend a little extra if you can. He doesn't even have to. Nobody had answered his question and he was afraid of wasting 50 bucks. I just gave some food for thought.  Honestly, I prefaced everything with - I haven't bought a tablet in 5 years, I still have my cintique so no need to keep up to date. The uni I go to, the places I've interned for and across the streams I've watched - the only tablets I've ever seen; something again I prefaced - but they're the guys who created the Surface Pro drivers, so they're at least objectively reputable. I googled the brand and found absolutely nothing other than some useless amazon reviews, some mentioned faults as to be expected with almost every product ever, and some giving great reviews - literally no gadget site had touched them.  Also really unsure why I'd have to point out that the majority of tablets cost above 500 bucks, the reason being they are generally considered a professional tool, the reason for cheaper models to exist is to cater to amateurs or hobbyists. This is a simple principle behind pretty much every product ever. If he was buying a guitar, I would give him the same advice - you can buy a 50 dollar plastic guitar that you can technically learn on, or you can save up and spend 300 for a guitar that you will at least want to play because you've invested, made sure it's what you want to do and neato, you now own something that means something to be proud of. Guitars cost thousands of thousands of dollars generally, so 300 aint too much, just like 120 isn't too much, even compared to 50. Each option has it's own merit, I just pointed out the latter option. I cannot believe I've spent so much time even bothering to labour this point, I really couldn't care less what this kid does at this point lol - I hope he fuckin uses the thing though, whatever he gets."

animation,3dt463,malistaticy,2,Sun Jul 19 04:57:43 2015 UTC,"The Wander Over Yonder guys did a pretty good job covering all of the basics. Looking around the internet, you can find pretty much all of what you're looking for. For instance, scenes are timed in storyboarding because you read out the storyboard as you're preparing to pitch it. If something doesn't fit, that's when you start mucking about with the board and figuring out what you should take out and how to make it all work without that bit.   But a lot of what you're looking for is going to change from studio to studio, and it will change based on each studio's needs. Everyone has a bit of a different workflow you need to learn to work with. For instance, let's talk about draft writing.   I've seen a few different ways this can be handled. The one I see most often is that the writers all get together and talk about the arc they're working on, and start to put together episodes that fit that arc. They'll just brainstorm while writing down ideas and little jokes and the like. Then each writer (or pair of writers, or team of writers) will take one episode and write out a rough script for it. Then everyone sits down and reads it through, giving feedback and offering suggestions for changes. At that point the draft can be given back to the first writer or given to another writer depending on the studio and how they like to work.   But I've also seen detailed show notes passed down and you basically have to write an episode that fits the show notes, then you get to talk to an editor who will give you the changes he or she thinks you need, then you'll go back and fix it or it'll be passed along to another writer or a script doctor.   But I've ALSO seen places that have their writers pitch episodes and then they write the pitches that get green-lit. It's all over the place.  So it really depends, man. It depends on you and how you work, it depends on your team and how your team works, and it depends on how the studio wants things done."

animation,3dqu7o,baaron25,4,Sat Jul 18 18:46:12 2015 UTC,Creator here.  Almost right!  Almost all of the blur was done directly in Tv Paint though.  After effects was mostly used for compositing some lighting effects and adding stuff like the screens on the stadium.
animation,3dqu7o,paperbaganimator,5,Sat Jul 18 19:55:27 2015 UTC,Oh and the 3D was done in Max.
animation,3dqu7o,paperbaganimator,2,Sat Jul 18 23:56:11 2015 UTC,Fantastic. Thank you so much. I have been trying to decide hat software to upgrade to from flash. I've used toonboom before and really like the feel of that. But I'm seeing more and more TV paint work. All I know is...I need to get away from flash.
animation,3dqu7o,baaron25,3,Sat Jul 18 23:59:54 2015 UTC,"My advice is that if you want to use tweens and reuse heaps of drawings use toonboom. TVPaint on the other hand has a slight learning curve. But if your looking at doing a lot of frame by frame and/or more painterly looking work use TV paint.  But yeah you're right flash is something to move away from, and the industry is following too."
animation,3dqu7o,tumatoboy,2,Sat Jul 18 20:40:14 2015 UTC,Interesting. Now I really feel the need to at least try TV paint. I really appreciate the feedback. Flash is just beginning to feel.....restricting and frustrating. Hopefully I can find a decent price or trial for TVpaint!

animation,3dq7y5,onlo,4,Sat Jul 18 14:44:15 2015 UTC,i can see a difference between number 1 and 4 and i think number 4 looks the best tbh
animation,3dq7y5,Dumsterdude,4,Sat Jul 18 12:11:57 2015 UTC,"the extra bounce in the last one is definitely the best.  But I'd recommend to keep going with it. Like you can make the tail bounce a bit too and bring the head down a bit more.  They say less is more, but that's a god damn lie. Because more is more, and that's why we call it more."
animation,3dq7y5,dethstrobe,2,Sat Jul 18 14:53:25 2015 UTC,"I'm a little concerned about going overboard. I actually tried bouncing the tail and/or the head but it kinda looked like it was stomping on the ground real hard. From the videos of birds hopping that I've watched it seems like they barely change position at all and almost just kind of... ping pong up and down vertically. I'm trying to keep it naturalistic, you know? On the other hand, everyone seems to prefer the extra bounce...  Edit: Put the head/tail jiggle back in. I think the second version is actually pretty good (1st one is same as #4). Fuck realism, maybe?  Edit 2: If you're wondering, I do bring the bird's head down for one frame in the second version but it's not really perceptible, at least to me. If I bring it down on the OTHER frame where it's on the ground (not even both frames, just changing the frame) I get the fairly extreme head bob seen in the third version. I wish I had a bit more control but I guess that's what happens when your entire animation has 4 frames and like 20 pixels."
animation,3dq7y5,dethstrobe,2,Sun Jul 19 09:04:21 2015 UTC,"Ironically, reality doesn't look very real. That's why in animation you need everything to be exaggerated with squash n' stretch, anticipation, follow through n' overlap, and the other principles that I don't remember as well.  If you want it to look smoother if you double the frame rate and increase the frames per second you'll be able to make it look smooth, even with only 20 pixels.  I can understand why you'd say it look like the bird is stomping on the ground though. And that's a great point to not exaggerate the animation as much. But I really like that last one here too. I think it looks good and feels more alive."
animation,3dq7y5,ticketferret,2,Sun Jul 19 14:30:01 2015 UTC,Number 4 is good it provides a nice bird hop.

animation,3dp7ur,Dark_Souls,3,Sat Jul 18 03:17:00 2015 UTC,"Welcome to a lifelong obsession!  -I bought my first tablet, a Wacom Bamboo, for about $75 (in 2008).  It's a smaller model but you don't need anything giant to animate on, in the beginning.  And Wacom is THE brand to have, in my opinion.    -I started Flash on 15 fps, as I was a little intimidated by 24.  But I'd recommend going right into 24, as it's really not much different.  You won't get any bad animating habits like I used to, when I worked at the wrong fps.  -I stick with 40 Smoothing on my brush.  Not too angular, and not so smooth that the lines start to break up.  -Google 'The 12 Principles of Animation'.  Do them all, multiple times.  Each of these things are like gold.  Also check out Richard Williams' The Animator's Survival Kit.  I found a pdf online and it put me on a great path.  -For lip sync, check out Draw with Jazza on Youtube. He is my personal favorite, and extremely helpful when I was learning how to lip sync.  Have a blast, we're here for you!

Check out the free version on iPad (if you have one), otherwise I think there might be some videos up on Youtube, or a PDF somewhere...  A few typical exercises to begin with: Bouncing ball, pendulum, ball with tail. It sounds boring, but bouncing ball is THE best way to learn many of the basic principles, and ball with tail basically covers the rest. Here's an example: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkrT90ESJb8  Also, make sure you dedicate some time everyday toward just drawing. Fill an A4 a day with sketches. Doesn't need to be pretty-looking characters, focus on making the poses easy to read, good sillhouettes, action lines, etc. Drawing from life is also very very useful, no matter what style you end up with!"

In my experience in the industry, no one cares about your schooling or your past, they only care about two things: Your work, and your track record.

I would rather buy the physical copy's so I know I have them around whenever I want to watch them.

I don't mind it as much if it's more akin to VHX or iTunes, where I get to keep the download of the file tied to an account forever. This way I can just login and watch the movie again. It adds a lot of convenience.  However, I do really love having things on my shelf.

animation,3djtvu,DrawingBlue,4,Thu Jul 16 21:13:23 2015 UTC,"AM alum here. If your choices are going to AM, or teaching yourself, of course the cheaper option is teaching yourself. If your choices are going to AM or going to a ""proper"" animation/art school, by FAR the cheaper option is AM. I went to a regular 4-year uni (not an art school), then did AM after graduation and I learned so much more about animation, the process, the industry, and the importance of getting real feedback weekly from experienced working professionals cannot be understated.   Animation/art schools are crazy expensive, but they are well connected. You may come out of school with a job, or you may not.   Personally, I wouldn't trade my time at a traditional school for anything. I made great friends and memories, but when it came to preparing me for the animation world, I wish I hadn't wasted that time. I loved AM and found it very worth the price. I haven't looked at their tuition prices recently, but I can't imagine they've gone up too much. Like any school, you get out of it what you put into it. Work hard, make connections, have fun"
animation,3djtvu,MrsRadon,2,Thu Jul 16 21:45:36 2015 UTC,"I'm also currently going to a 4 year school majoring in graphic design, but I've always wanted to be an animator.  Out of curiosity, can I ask if you currently have a job in the animation field? AM looks great and all but if you can't find a job in the animation field that is a lot of wasted money."
animation,3djtvu,Sam571,1 point,Fri Jul 17 06:38:28 2015 UTC,"I been reading that AM does a lot of things to help you get a good job, but of course you still need to work hard. I read that they set up theese events where you get to talk to big guys in industry, show them your reel and ask some questions you might have."
animation,3djtvu,MrsRadon,1 point,Fri Jul 17 08:01:06 2015 UTC,"I am currently employed within the field. My particular path to employment was through a personal connection I had made. However, if I had not attended AM (or had the discipline to teach myself...which i don't) I would not have the skills to back up that connection. Getting jobs in the industry is all about who you know, but you won't last long if you don't have the skills, and AM gave me that. I could have gone to an art school and gotten the same skills, but I'd be in debt up to my ears and I know plenty of people who took this route, and are still unemployed. So, either way, you're going to have a hard time getting in. AM does have a great community and is well respected in the industry. And if you put in the effort to make connections, then you're in a good spot. No matter your path, breaking in is hard, you need to work hard to make it happen."

The course is well paced and ensures that you have a solid foundation, even if you ""think"" you know things going into it.  The other part is the community. There is a HUGE community focus throughout the school. Students helping students. Because of that, and the sheer size of it, you're going to find out about studio jobs etc before they even pop up on recruitment sites etc. You'll also be able to play your part down the road and help others. :)"
animation,3djcxl,BrickWallStudent,2,Thu Jul 16 19:09:25 2015 UTC,"Wow you've got a lot of questions and a lot of anxieties.   What's the field like?   To be honest I don't know. Animation in general varies wildly from freelance animators, sweatshop studios to hollywood studios. The ""field"" is a lot like any other creative field out there.   What are some types of jobs I can land doing this?   Pretty much anything. Animation is one of those things that applies to pretty much every aspect of media production. You could do SFX, you could create web elements, you could animate or model or rig for games and movies, you could freelance your own business etc etc. The key here is specialty. To stay competitive for high level positions you need to focus on a few areas. You could also broaden your approach to market to ""low"" level positions.    Is this something I can actually make a career out of instead of some hobby?   Uh, yes. Have you noticed how popular 3d animation is these days? It's becoming more prolific than ever and video games is moving to take over the world as a primary form of entertainment.   What are some big things I should focus on to really get myself moving forward?   Networking and marketing. Stay in touch with your peers and teachers, attend conventions, join forums, unions or any other local groups of people that are doing similar things. Work on your portfolio and reel. That is the crux of showing people your value and capability as a creative. If you dont have impressive enough work or the kind of work you will be looking for in your portfolio, time to do work. See if you can find people who want pro-bono or cheap animations or just use your free time to work on personal projects.    People who work for a company doing animation, what's it like?   Wish i could tell you :P I just freelance for now.  Will you be able to support a family? I would hope so. As a rough guesstimate i would expect most professional 3d animators make no less than 35k usd a year for entry level. Like i said 3d animation is the best place to be right now. Jobs for creatives will always be sporadic, unreliable but occasionally very lucrative. If you can find or make your own work that's all the better but will take much more of your time and effort. Strike a balance, work hard, do what you gotta do."
animation,3djcxl,Siegecow,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:53:50 2015 UTC,I appreciate the response. How has freelancing worked out for you so far? What do you typically do as a freelancer?
animation,3djcxl,Siegecow,2,Thu Jul 16 20:03:22 2015 UTC,"Freelancing has worked out decently. I'm horrible when it comes to networking and marketing, so I could probably get more work more than I do. I also work a part time job and work on personal projects to fill free time, so I mostly screw around with that stuff until a job falls into my lap  Freelancing I've worked on medical animations, live visuals for a club, music videos, mo-graph bumpers for youtube channels and animations for local county FYI videos.   I mostly work in 2d with some basic 3d here and there. I work in Portland OR/Vancouver WA neither of which have tons of media work going on compared to LA, Seattle or Vancouver BC"
animation,3djcxl,raltfoosney,2,Thu Jul 16 20:16:07 2015 UTC,"It sounds like you want someone to make up your mind for you, to do your research. I understand the anxieties but to some degree I think you've put the cart before the horse.  Here's my .02, anyone who told you """"don't worry about how much things cost, or how much money you make in life because as long as you have fun, it doesn't matter.""""  Doesn't have your best interests at heart.  You only live once yeah, but why risk homelessness when you had the ability and opportunity to get a real career that's in demand.  Is animation not a career? Well it is, but it's not as it seems. People like to glamorize it but there's little glamor.  First competition is fierce. We no longer need big teams of animators since 3D and Koreans do the bulk of it. It's a race to the bottom. Lowest bidder, double so in advertisement and game development.  The field is very competitive as technology replaces roles that used to pay a livable wage. Most animators aren't even credited the same way as they used to be since they try to hide outsourcing.   Seth MacFarlane get's tons of credit for his shows but who animated them? Faceless cogs in the overseas production machine.  You want a career in animation but do you have a demo reel? Are you prepared to get rejected 200 times? After being accepted are you prepared to throw away 4+ hours of work because they said it ""doesn't look right""?  There are freelance jobs but you must be the lowest bidder to get them. There are advertising jobs but they are soul sucking creative vortexes. There are game development jobs but you'll get tired of making run cycles."
animation,3djcxl,kereviz,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:15:52 2015 UTC,"Speaking for vfx here.   There are jobs around if you're fairly competent with a decent demoreel. If you want to be an animator you definitely need to specialise on animation. Being a generalist helps, since you are likely to be able to solve some of your own problems without resorting to help from others but those are not the skills that get you a job as an animator. You need to be able to understand the  mechanics of physical motion for bipeds and animals, posing, acting etc and show that you have a solid understanding of these in your demoreel, preferrably within 1 minute. In smaller companies, rigging skills definitely come in handy.  As you've said, it has become quite competetive in the last few years, with more animation schools around and the quality of student reels increasing. There are jobs if you're persistent enough. The main problem for the vfx side of things is that, jobs are moving where the tax breaks are. A few years back, UK was the place to be, there are still a lot of jobs in London but the current trend seems to be Canada, who knows where the jobs will be in 10 or even 5 years. Hard to say. So it might not be too easy to stay put and raise a family if you need to move around the countries to be able to keep your job. Games might be more stable, but I haven't worked in that field so don't rely on me.  Salaries are likely to be above average once you have some experience but working hours can get very bad and there can be quite a lot of unpaid overtime depending on which company and country you are in, effectively decreasing your hourly rate to something not so acceptable. You're also likely to be on a project based short contract which might not get extended after the project. So there might be a few months every year where you're just chasing your next gig, without an income unless you're lucky enough to land a more permanent position (which doesn't happen a lot in vfx anymore).  On the (somewhat) positive side, the job is a lot of fun and creatively satisfying to a certain extent (remember it's someone elses film you're working on and your creative input is very very limited, but still, you're less likely to kill yourself on a Monday morning).People (by people I mainly mean the artists) can be great fun to work with. It's likely to be a very informal office environment full of geeks. You can brag to your friends about the stuff you've worked on(which loses it's appeal in less than 3 months).  TL:DR; Do I worry about my future financially? I absolutely do. Would I choose another job if I had another chance? Definitely not (I have to admit it's much easier if you don't have a family to look after and only responsible for yourself. If my circumstances were different, my answers could be different as well)."

So what I took is not only is this person a talented stop motion animator, but they have a good sense for design and would be a good culture fit at most creative agencies.   If I was in charge of hiring, this would standout about the hundreds of resumes, portfolios, or personal websites.

The principle seems accurate, but something you cannot forget is the logic of the movement you want to represent: If  the character is going to run to the left side, he needs to turn the arms to the right in order to charge the movement (to anticipate the movement).  You can see an example here, but the best way of doing this is getting up (or asking to a friend to get up) and see what seems more natural.  This being said, Congrats! The final part is hilarious."

You don't have to be the best, but being bad makes everything else you do a complete waste of time, not only for you, but for everyone you show your stuff to.  Seek out feedback from impartial people and be honest with yourself about your own work.  Get better every day.  Get on sites like meetup.com and look up every group you can find that's relevant in any way to animation.  Game developers, hobbyists, whoever, and join the groups. Go to the meetups, get to know people, get your face out there and show your absolute best work.  Networking is how I've gotten every job I've had since college.  It takes time and dedication, but it'll pay off sooner or later."

animation,3d7qkg,Rocktave,1 point,Wed Jul 15 00:37:47 2015 UTC,"Not bad at all, man.  I'd really like to see more referenced pieces though.  I didn't really pick up on anything that you might've used ref for here and your reel didn't seem to start out with your best work.  A general rule with reels is to put your absolute best work at the beginning of the reel and your second best at the end, and keep the reel relatively short.  No more than 3 minutes.  The current length of your reel right now is good.   I like the fact that you're animating to audio too, that's a good practice to be in the habit of.  Keep doing that.  Sites like 11secondclub are really good for that.   With that being said, your drawings could benefit from better construction, and you really need to study gestures.  It looks like you're flying on auto-pilot with your animation here, without really making much use  of the core fundamental principles of animation.  Construction, line of action, ease-in and ease-out, squash and stretch, etc aren't very apparent in really any of these sequences.  LEARN THESE PRINCIPLES!  I can't stress that enough.  You will be amazed how much better your work will be.  Read ""The Animator's Survival Kit"" and watch those videos.  It will blow your mind and make you wonder how you ever lived without it.  Also, go take a life drawing class somewhere, and do a shit ton of gestural studies.  Do gestures as often as possible, until they come as naturally to you as breathing.  (I should take this advice myself.)  Here are a few more resources that have helped me tremendously:    Online Animation Instruction    Proko  Will Terrell  Keep animating and in the meantime, network as much as you can.  I think you're already at a point where you could get an entry level job.. places like Bento Box would probably put you to work starting out on in-betweens, and you'd learn fast that way.  Contact as many studios like this that you can find, and submit your work.  If they reject it, ask for their honest feedback on how to improve your reel.  Don't give up.  Keep submittng, and keep animating.  You'll get better and if you stay consistent, you will get work.  Feel free to ask me questions.  I'm a 3D animator, myself, and I really respect people who excell at hand drawn animation.  If you can do it by hand, you can do it in any other medium.  Sorry for the wall of text, I hope this helps.  Keep it up!"
animation,3d7qkg,Jowsteen,2,Wed Jul 15 01:49:13 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the kind words and the really solid feed back.  A couple of follow up questions/comments though:  What do you mean by, ""referenced pieces"" and why are they important to show?  Which piece did you feel was the strongest? I know that we should always put our best work first, and I thought that the shot with the couch turn-around to be my strongest, but I would like to know what you thought (and maybe even why).  I think you're spot on with the criticism about construction, line-of-action, etc. and that was a critique that I have heard before when showing my reel. So thanks for confirming that further. The piece I'm working on now (more animating to audio, heh) is more heavily focused on solid constructions, more interesting silhouettes, stronger poses, and more thoughtful in-betweens.  The Richard Williams book is my bible, and is normally sitting by my work station at any given time (right now I'm in the middle of moving, so it's in a box for the time being) and I reference it often. I try to focus on improving one or two principles with each project, as opposed to getting bogged down with trying to improve them all at once. After my next piece I'm just gonna go through and animate many of the lessons in the book/videos.  I'm already subscribed to Proko as well! Haha. I will certainly check out the other two links provided too. I'm sure they will be helpful.   Again, thanks for the advice. You were very helpful and I appreciate you taking that time. I'll keep everything you said in mind.  Also, I would be interested in seeing your reel/work as well. I love seeing other animators' stuff."
animation,3d7qkg,threedb,2,Wed Jul 15 05:42:56 2015 UTC,"Well, what I mean by ""referenced"" is simply animation that you did using video footage as reference, for example;  you shoot video of yourself acting out the audio clip that you're using in a sequence.  Using reference like this can help you nail performances by revealing subtleties in posing, timing and other nuances that you wouldn't have thought of otherwise.  The biggest and best use reference constantly.    As for your strongest piece, I think the bit at 00:50 stood out the most, because of how strongly you caricatured that guy's face, and how it followed up with the action afterwards, but that's just my opinion.  Yeah, the couch turnaround wasn't bad either, but the point is to grab the viewer's attention immediately, without having to make them wait for your best bit to appear.  Maybe start off with an isolated animation that you create specifically to showcase the strength of your ability, then transition to the audio clip animation with the acting.  It's a judgement call and you should taylor your reel to suit whoever you're trying to get a job with.  If you know a studio is looking for a specific type of animator, put your strongest example of that type of animation at the beginning of the reel you submit to them.  Make it relevant to their needs.    As for my reel, Here is my latest.  I recently started a new job at a games studio, and I already have a TON of more work that I can use for a new reel, I just need to find the time to get it all compiled and edited."
animation,3d7qkg,Jowsteen,2,Wed Jul 15 13:03:01 2015 UTC,"Oh right, I know exactly what you mean now. I've seen plenty of referenced footage, especially in 3D and stop-motion. I'll give that a shot.   I'll keep your advice in mind the next time I cut my demo reel. I'll experiment with putting the clips in a different order.  Awesome reel too, man -- really impressive."
animation,3d7qkg,CobaltCog,5,Wed Jul 15 16:16:32 2015 UTC,"Reading all the other comments, pretty much everything has already been said, but I'll share with you my story anyway. Back in 2010 i did the online Animation school ""Animation Mentor"" i graduated 18 months later and was practically the poster child for ""excited, energetic, ready-to-work animator"". I too had a MISERABLE job that I hated and was desperately trying to break into the industry. Back in 2011, the economy drop had just started to really make an impression on the industry and it seemed like I had won the lottery in bad timing, but i stayed optimistic and applied EVERYWHERE!! It ended up taking an entire year and a half after I graduated before I finally got a random gig. It was a tiny 2 week job working from home but it was something I could say was ""professional experience"". After that I randomly got a phone interview for an actual game studio and because I was able to talk about this ""professional experience"" I had, they ended up hiring me and giving me my first big break. Ever since then I have been working on games and have been lucky enough to find work consistently at one studio or another.  There are two HUGE things you need to do right now in your position. DON'T GIVE UP and NETWORK. It's so cliche, I know, network network network, blah blah blah. I know you hear it all the time and probably think, ya but how? Ever since that first job i got, EVERY job i have gotten since is through word of mouth and knowing somebody that knows somebody. The thing they don't tell you is when studios post job openings, most the time they already have people they want to hire. They LEGALLY have to post the job even if they already found someone, and usually what happens first is they ask the employees at the studio if they know anyone. If you can find and befriend anyone working at a studio (maybe someone you went to school with) Id say that's your best bet.  The other factor is the don't give up. I cant tell you how many times i mentally gave up during that year and a half. Send out that demo reel and resume every 2-3 months to everyone. Even though you may never get a response, they are getting it, and someone is looking at it. The biggest question you should ask yourself right now is Do you REALLY want to be an animator? If that answer is truly yes, then just keep doing it, keep working on something. 11 second club is a great way to practice and keep to a deadline so you actually finish it.  Overall man, in all honesty, this is a VERY competitive field right now. Online schools are pumping out new animators by the boat full while studios keep shutting down and putting senior animators out on the street to look for jobs too. The industry is flooded with animators looking for work. But all you need is that 1st job and then its like a light switch turned on. Don't give up on your dream and just keep putting yourself out there, it will come eventually! Good luck!!"

You will meet people and it will be easier to find the next gig.  And once you do get your first job, before you have that celebratory beer -- BEFORE -- start looking for the next one.

You only need to success once to make things work. Only once. Try hard. Reduce the future intervention of luck by increasing the quality of your work. And be patient.  If you need help, in any way, count with me."

I thought a desk job would be fine, but 40 hours a week just leaves me too drained to do much on most nights.   What is it you do at your job, more specifically? So at least I can avoid that in the future.  Also I would be interested in seeing your work on YouTube if you have any to show yet."

I've been in more propitious works, with less hours and less responsability, but I had the same problem (that seems to be our eternal torment: procrastination). The more time I have, the more time I spend doing nothing.  I tried to quit my job before because of this, but I told to myself: If I cannot do the first episode while working, I am not going to do it without a job (or with a less time consuming one). So, here I am trying to demonstrate myself that I am capable of controlling my time with willpower (I have figured out that this is just a matter of organization: if you adjust your life to a well balanced schedule and you accept the fact that sometimes you are going to fail fullfilling it, but that is not enought problem to continue living like that, you will be enjoying your time in a very very efficient way).   If I achive that, If I end the first episode while working in hell, I will be ready to leave the job. (I have to say that this resolution has come due to a really intense age crisis).  I have nothing yet on youtube, but as soon as I have the music for the intro, I will send it to you. I would love to hear some ""impartial"" judgement of my work.

animation,3da6ov,1029chris,2,Tue Jul 14 18:23:28 2015 UTC,"Needs a companion (missionaries always come in two's partially to help mitigate danger to people they visit, and to themselves as well as reduce church liability).  A true LDS member would have said ""Telestial kingdom"" or ""Spirit Prison"" because we don't have a concept of ""Burn in Hell"" quite the same way.  Fun Fact, the LDS actually did shock therapy, but not on investigators of the religion, but gay members: https://ryambiguous.wordpress.com/2013/03/09/gays-and-mormons-and-electroshock-aversion-therapy-at-byu/  If you need more episodes and ideas for episodes I might recommend ""My Book of Mormon Podcast"" where a person who knows almost nothing about the church podcasts as he reads the Book of Mormon.  A lot of authentic, ""Wait, you believe what now?"" moments.  For example, when I was a missionary (I've since left the church) we'd read the Book of Mormon with people and get to 1 Nephi 3, about 6 or so pages in, and God tells one of the main characters to cut off the head of a drunken political leader in Jerusalem.  People would balk at the idea.  I think a schpeel about listening to the voices in one's head, telling them to do bad things could play well into your animation.  Also, relevant, the CIA torture guides were written by mormons:  http://www.ibtimes.com/mormons-cia-torture-report-lds-church-morally-bankrupt-because-involvement-torture-1750303  Having one of the guys who wrote the torture guidelines be Norman's companion could be good for a subtle-humor joke."

I was wondering if you have any tips for a complete beginner to animation? I've been doing life drawing daily, but how exactly do you creatively think of concepts/ideas to animate? Are there any other tips u can give a beginner apart from just practicing A LOT?"
animation,3d141g,hello2312,4,Sun Jul 12 21:57:04 2015 UTC,"Thanks mate! It's great that you're doing life drawing, it's such an important thing and it teaches you so much! It's always the number one thing I suggest.   Ideas are the hardest part for me. Heaps of the time I'll have a sense of what I want, or see something, love it, and want to recreate my own version, but just can't. The biggest effort seems to be at the start to storyboard an idea, like it, and stick with it. I do a lot of research, which is basically hunting Pinterest and Vimeo for interesting things - this Vimeo channel is full of amazing animation. I'll try and be completely original in my work, however there's a lot that you can benefit through studying other people's work. Trying to figure out someone's thought process is really useful, as well as breaking down their animation and going through it frame by frame. Sometimes there's some funky stuff in there that you wouldn't have noticed. So, if you're ever stumped, try mimicking something that you like. Not necessarily as a published piece, but as an exercise, and adding a bit of yourself to it. IMHO, creativity is about arranging the familiar in an unfamiliar way.   If you've got any work online, I'd be happy to give you some pointers.   Edit: Oh, and ideas don't exclusively come from animation. Being interested in fine art, architecture, film, engineering, graphic design, etc really helps too.   Edit 2: Oh, and nothing ever comes out exactly the way it's planned. There's a lot of discovery involved in the process, so don't be discouraged too easily, early on. Sometimes good accidents happen, which is what really happened with this."
animation,3d141g,tumatoboy,2,Sun Jul 12 23:29:22 2015 UTC,"thanks very much for the detailed reply! and another quick question: Do you use any other programs apart from TVpaint? Like ToonBoom, etc. Is there any special reason why you prefer tvpaint?"
animation,3d141g,StressCavity,1 point,Mon Jul 13 01:05:25 2015 UTC,"Everyone at uni uses Toon Boom, we're told it's the industry standard. I figure that's for rigging characters, cut out animation, high volume studio stuff, kids TV shows. But that's not the industry that interests me, maybe, and I don't really like that aesthetic.   However, all animation done in TVP can be done in Toon Boom, can be done in Photoshop, can be done in Flash, but the aesthetic and work flow will vary. There are a thousand ways to skin a cat.   I've used all these programs, but I like TVP for early animation because it's so quick to use and intuitive for me. It's really the closest digital alternative you can get to traditional animation, flipping paper. You can achieve a similar visual style to stuff done in PS, but it's just so much quicker, less lag, and so much more straight forward and less fiddly. Having said that, I'm not the biggest fan of clean line and inking in TVP. That I usually use Flash and/or Photoshop, although I'm still figuring that out.   I'd recommend trying everything and finding what feels right with you. Takes a bit of time and experimenting, and I'm still learning lots too."

A tad more speed as they launch from his hands, a little more deceleration as they approach their apex, and bit more acceleration as they fall back to Pooh's hands might help. Also, there is a slightly noticeable snap as the ball falls back into his hand. Either speeding up the fall or adding one more frame before reattaching to the hand would help hide that snap better.

animation,3d0evx,FilmsByDan,5,Sun Jul 12 13:16:15 2015 UTC,If you are using music from the movies then you will have trouble getting ad-rev from youtube. Otherwise you will have to work out in advance who will get that money. Freebooting is also something to consider; are you going to just take your money up front and let your customer profit (or not) from the video that they paid for and therefore own or are you going to sell internet right to your customer so you retain ownership and can use your video further down the line. Always plan for a video to make you lots of money and fame just in case one day it does. It would be a shame for someone else to get rich from your work.

animation,3d0evx,alextbrown4,1 point,Sun Jul 12 16:51:16 2015 UTC,I would pick a per hour rate. I'm not sure what the industry standard is so you'll have to look into it. I've done one freelance job so far and it was a set amount. I did a 20 second logo animation for $250.00 USD if that gives you any frame of reference.   Charge what you think you'll need. And I wouldn't charge half first then half later in case of any sort of falling out on either side.   Also there are plenty templates online for freelance work agreements. Just tailor it to suit your needs.   Hope this helped and good luck. Make sure to record all your hours and don't be afraid to charge what you think you're worth.

My reason for leaning towards the fixed amount was that there would be no arguments later on. I'm concerned that he later could refuse to pay the bill if it turns out to be more than expected. The client is a guy wanting me to make an anniversary gift for him to give to his wife.  As I haven't met him and he's not representing a business, I feel getting some cash in my possession beforehand would convince me that he's serious. I would hate to put in 50+ hours of work to finish the project and have him change his mind.   I'll search online for some of those templates so I don't have to start from scratch. Thanks!"

While I'm happy Lightfoot offers that round pegbar, their shipping policy drives me crazy.  Even in the US I had to spend ~$10 for them to mail a lightweight plastic pegbar in a tiny envelope to me.  I called to try to set up an optional shipping method but they were pretty set in their way.  Unfortunately I couldn't find anywhere else that caries them.  I ended up getting together some friends (if you know any students in an animation class that's a good place to start) to split shipping costs on a large order.  Additionally, since you're going the round pegbar route, I want to warn you that many three hole punches (generally the cheaper ones) don't actually punch an accurate 1/4"" hole.  They're generally a bit larger, so the paper will wiggle around (not very useful for animation).  I'd recommend trying some out before committing. What I ended up using was a paper drill -- I think the one I bought is discontinued, but it's the same idea as this but with three drills.  The holes are a perfect 1/4"" and fit nice and snug on the pegbar."

You didn't include any works by Don Bluth, like The Secret of Nimh or All Dogs go to Heaven. Ralph Bakshi would be another animation director to look at. Your list, apart from Alice and The Thief and the Cobbler, is mostly modern. The rest of the films are from the 90's on, and 10 of them are from the 2000's alone. I'd say it's time you expanded your historic knowledge of animated film, and also animated film outside of Disney. I also think that traditional and 3d animated films shouldn't be compared. They are vastly different mediums. The difference is as profound as the difference between painting and sculpting.  I'm also surprised none of Satoshi Kon's works made it into this list. Paprika certainly deserves a spot on this list. Another superbly animated short film would be ""A Country Doctor"" which is an anime based on the short story by Franz Kafka. Here's some other short film collections to watch. Genius Party, Genius Party Beyond, and Memories. Magnetic Rose (which is the first short film in Memories, and directed Katsuhiro Otomo, the director of Akira) may be one of the most beautiful animated short films ever."

Maybe in Nimh, which has a disturbing plot so it fits, but I have a hard time believing it for others. I just kinda hate the way both of them design characters. Don Bluth's look like pages from a cheap colouring book and the way that Bakshi does his rotoscope means that most of them fall into the uncanny valley (at least for me)"

animation,3cur06,Feinbergi,1 point,Fri Jul 10 23:00:41 2015 UTC,the art work on it is very impressive. i really wish i could do that style of drawing that well. as for the animation though id haft to say there isn't really anything there aside from making cut outs move across a screen. so sadly from an animation stand point this to me isn't all that good but i do like the art work used.
animation,3cur06,TheSlackerKing,1 point,Sat Jul 11 04:32:49 2015 UTC,"I like it. It's very different. I think a strong style alone can be enough to hold a simple animation. I would think about the light. The light mainly illuminates the back of the main head (drawing your attention there) but a lot of the action starts to the right of the screen. Otherwise great start, keep it up!"

If you're into After Effects a lot of folks use Cinema4D I think for 3D Package.  That might have a RenderMan options but might not.   But it certainly would have rendering options.  Maya, Max, etc work just as well.  Anyway, Adobe media encoder is a totally different renderer than RenderMan."

You simply do the Illustrations in ""Adobe Illustrator"" on Layers and import them into After Effects. In After Effects you animate this stuff. You should be able to do an Animation like this in Maybe 200 Hours maybe less. Depends on your Skill I guess. I recommend ""Digital Tutors"" for Professional tutorials.

I like anime studio pro because of its unique animation capabilities.  but the thing is, you should really commit to learning a bunch of different software and styles to see what works for you the best.   as a ""pick up and play"", if youre in a hurry to make something decent, i'd try flash."
animation,3csboy,Gollomor,1 point,Fri Jul 10 12:33:14 2015 UTC,"<but the thing is, you should really commit to learning a bunch of different software and styles to see what works for you the best.>  This is good advice. Software changes often but fundamentals of movement and storytelling provide a foundation for creating work regardless of tool set. After effects is powerful and relatively quick at achieving results once you know what you are doing. It's very deep with a huge community of artists writing scripts and plug ins to help extend its core functionality. The learning curve might be a bit steep if your base knowledge of animation principles is low. I second the recco for Digital Tutors."

animation,3cooh7,swimie,16,Thu Jul 9 15:23:19 2015 UTC,looks pretty cool! One thing I'd change is that if you just made her head move up and down even a little bit (but not forwards and backwards like a pigeon) it'd give it just that much more life!
animation,3cooh7,fluffkomix,3,Thu Jul 9 15:33:02 2015 UTC,I agree and I'd also bend the arms a little more at some points. Maybe add a swing to the sword.  This is the problem with cutout style animation for me. Small movements work well but running can look odd if I don't break down the whole rig into lots of little sections. Well unless I make the character super stylised.
animation,3cooh7,BlitzWing1985,1 point,Thu Jul 9 15:59:35 2015 UTC,"Yep, this is why a lot of studios use hand drawn walk cycles or re-draw a lot for their walk cycles. Otherwise it looks clunky"

animation,3cooh7,Vladzy,2,Thu Jul 9 19:22:07 2015 UTC,"Yes! Adding the hip movement makes a running/walking animation look more real and interesting, so move that hip up and down, because right now it looks like her hip is on a rail and the feet are catching up with her.  With the hip animation, it will gain a lot more weight and feel to the whole run."

animation,3cooh7,Bluth_bananas,4,Sat Jul 11 13:18:07 2015 UTC,"Really nice! That hair :D. I try to think of ""running"" as a series of jumps with each leg pushing the body up and forward. It couldn't hurt to bend the knees a bit more, bringing the whole figure down at the hips, then dramatically up (possibly forward) on the leap."
animation,3cooh7,deepthot42,3,Thu Jul 9 15:47:58 2015 UTC,"It feels like someone running in slow motion or the type of run they do right before they stop. Obviously realism isn't completely necessary, but thing about running with gear on, there would be more bend at the hip... almost constantly falling/jumping forward and catching yourself with the legs. The hair is great secondary animation but since the head and torso are locked, it doesnt really supplement anything. Great start though! I can see this turning out really nice. There was some animation of a bulldog on here or maybe in aftereffects a few days ago and the overlap there was really nice."
animation,3cooh7,TheCowboyIsAnIndian,3,Thu Jul 9 16:01:23 2015 UTC,"good start. The run itself is a bit too slow, I'd speed it up by 50%  The pivot on the sword looks off, and it doesn't seem to be moving with the hips.  timing is too even on all of the limbs.  forearm and head needs more follow through.  I'd add a little more shoulder movement to give the impression of the body rotating slightly during the run"

""Stupid me"", ""Wasn't expecting anyone to do anything"" make you sound more petulant than you probably are.  Sounds rude, I realize but if you want money those are the breaks.  Now if you still want to animate here's some advice:  You can get started for free right now. Synfig and MonkeyJam are two great animation programs for the low cost of 100% free.   Drawings can either be scanned in or drawing digitally and sequenced in MonkeyJam.  Or you can draw characters and move them with ""bones"" in Synfig.  If you have no drawing programs: Krita is free for raster and Inkscape is free for vectors.  If you'd rather use paper drawings you can do that too since a flatbed scanner will set you back about $50 used and $100 new.  You have more technology on your cell phone than the creators of Southpark had when they were making their VHS  tape cartoon with construction paper. Don't let budgets constrain your creativity otherwise you're likely to become a collector not a creator."

If you're interested in the program, and especially if you already have it, check it out!  It's used for a variety of things, from editing to special effects compositing, to animation. I use it for all three really.  And while you might find more efficent workflows, I have a hard time seeing you do any harm by taking a dive into the program.  Check out the Video Copilot tutorials. They give a really great foundation that you can build off."

animation,3ckq80,glimpee,2,Thu Jul 9 08:12:19 2015 UTC,I have maya and some books for it but damn if it doesnt take a lot of time to even learn the basics. I care about 2d animation more anyways  On TB I've only been doing freehand practice. I started story boarding for a music video until I realized I needed over 2k drawings and it took me like a week to do 100 haha  I really wanted to make a storyboard portfolio and try to get some freelance work this summer but there's no way I'ma finish my portfolio so I'm focusing more on music for now  next time I'm feeling the animation bug (prob next week) I'll throw up AE and Toonboom and start practicing color/depth/background  Thanks a ton for all your help
animation,3ckq80,cheatisnotdead,1 point,Thu Jul 9 17:28:31 2015 UTC,"Maya is unbelievably dense. And yes, frame-by frame animation takes for-fucking-ever. Once you have pencil lines and motion you're happy with, you're less then a third through the process. Cleanup takes forever. Coloring takes forever.  AE is comparably fast to do whatever you're trying to do, usually.  I would personally storyboard in AE rather then TB anyways. I tend to get carried away in TB, and AE forces me to limit the scope of what I'm trying to do.  My advice is to do something SUPER tiny. A ball bounce, a walk cycle, something that's less then 24 frames in Toon Boom. Then, put that animation in AE and see what you can do. Camera and 3D layers make parallax a snap, have some simple animated backgrounds, learn to put a vignette on top of the whole thing, or put a texture behind it. Basic stuff, but stuff I use every day.  If you have any questions, feel free to PM me."
animation,3ckq80,glimpee,1 point,Thu Jul 9 18:26:35 2015 UTC,"No 3D space, these are all just 2D PNG images layered on top of each other.

This is as 2D as it gets.  http://puu.sh/iRZV5/3149853e1a.jpg  This one shows the stones.

animation,3cn17h,CreepinCreepyCreeper,3,Thu Jul 9 04:23:34 2015 UTC,Toon Boom. Pro animation software. Better than flash for basically everything animation. They have a variety of editions. if you can catch one of their sales you can get one for under 400. But dont get flash to animate. juuuust dont.
animation,3cn17h,Zileris,2,Thu Jul 9 05:00:49 2015 UTC,Or you can pay monthly for the basic package at more than reasonable $
animation,3cn17h,zerohero13,1 point,Thu Jul 9 05:37:01 2015 UTC,Yeah I went from animating on a ds to flash and it was very difficult to get adjusted.
animation,3cn17h,SirNyan,2,Thu Jul 9 21:31:00 2015 UTC,"From the korra half baked, it's definitely not for the light hearted (beginners).  I would say if the person is good, any animation software, or even flipbook is able to do this job. Anyway, if you are looking for free animation software, you can try using all the industry softwares with trail version. E.g. Flash, Toon Boom, Animation-ish and Digicel (which is free but tools are tough to use imo).  Why do I say the Korra half baked is not for beginners? Simply because that animation requires knowledge of principles of animation, human drawing skill, human mechanics, colouring skills. 10+hrs to produce that animation is, in fact, fast.  If you don't mind, I'll share a rough process on how that animation is done.   draft animation of character motion (most likely stick figure) 30 - 60 mins Drawing the character in details (hair, cloth, motion blur) 2-4hours Coloring of animation (basic color, fireball, fireball reflects on body) 3 hours+ Any final touch up here and there (Artists spend a lot of time refining because they are never satisfied all the time) 2hrs+   As you can see, the overall looks very nice because of the drawing and colouring of character frame by frame. If that animation is roughly 3 secs, taking each second as 10 frames, that would be conservatively 30 frames of drawing and colouring. ( I just saw the info which says it contains 36 frames)  If you are planning to do this for fun, stick to softwares with free trial (after all, you need to learn to use the program before you can draw nicely on it). Otherwise, just try animating like how you do it on your flipnotes.   Most importantly, enjoy the process :) Hope I helped in anyway."
animation,3cn17h,Nash_Lin,1 point,Thu Jul 9 09:53:52 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the info. As I said I'm an artist, so I do have quite an understanding of figures/human drawing & mechanics. And this type of art (even with little experience) comes very naturally to me, and through my life I have studied 2d animation enough that these won't really be an issue. I just wanted to find a program that would allow me to put those skills to use. I've actually wanted to animate professionally since I was young and when I was in school I didn't persue it as much as I should have. But anyway, this was very helpful, and thanks."

One of the tricks that they used at Will Vinton Studios in the 80's/90's Claymation films and ads was to use a polarizing filter on their cameras. This gets rid of the glare on the oily clay surface, flattening it a bit more.   There's a whole back story to the film, this ship is the good guy ship called the Defiance. Hence why it looks clean.

In this case there are still quite a few TV productions (Gravity Falls, Simpsons, Bob's Burgers), many ads and especially in Europe there are even some feature films. It's rarely done on paper and uses many digital shortcuts here and there, but it's 2D.  And then of course there is the well established art scene in Canada and Europe (some US) where many interesting films are made that often use very laborious traditional animation methods."

animation,3ciz72,Lucius_Annaeus_Senec,4,Wed Jul 8 07:35:48 2015 UTC,"Well the Dr. Katz stuff has barely any animation - it's just very quick lipsync and wiggling lines, they don't actually move on camera. Smart, but you probably can't save any more work than like that.  If you want to actually move arms and legs, you could work with rigs and pre-made drawings, so you never actually have to redraw much. Take South Park for example, most of the animation is done by shifting the parts around and occasionally replacing them.  Some people take a different route and make very sophisticated, fluid animation but with very easy to draw designs like stick figures.  I would make a list with things that you absolutely have to do to convey your idea (do you have to show how people actually move? If yes how fluid? Do you need lipsync?) and then look more specifically for technology that could provide the compromise between efficiency and quality for your specific plan."

The person who eavesdrops on the conversation and asks ""What are you guys talking about?"" was pitched a little too high, and it just didn't sound natural. The animation was simple, but functional enough, and simplicity isn't a bad thing if the scene doesn't really require a lot of detail for it to work, although I did think that shot of the 'big fat liar' was way too sparse. It needed a road, or a sidewalk, or something, because that shot looks unfinished. All in all, don't take the rejection to mean that your film is bad, because it's not, it's good, and there are lots of good films that don't get to make it into festivals, and even though the Ottawa Anim.

animation,3cf9ta,wagamo,1 point,Wed Jul 8 02:41:45 2015 UTC,"I use toon boom harmony in studio. It's vastly more capable than anime studio. That's not to say that anime studio isn't a valid tool, but the capabilities just aren't comparable from what I've seen.  Flash is also widely used of course, and can create some great animation. Flash animators struggling to transition to toon boom usually try to apply flash knowledge to the workflow and that's just not going to work. Harmony is a completely different beast, despite some slight similarities in the interface like the timeline.  Edit: Sorry for the long reply, just addressing some thoughts mentioned in the discussion. Harmony definitely has a steeper learning curve, especially if you're learning it on your own. Ultimately the best software to use is the one you're most comfortable with."

animation,3cd6lb,P4QO,2,Tue Jul 7 13:17:42 2015 UTC,Agree with u/mleegart. Perhaps if you maintain the position of the fist a little bit while the body is turning you should have a more powerfull movement (like charging the hit). I would also try to make all the movement in one fluid step (it seems to be two steps and it steals some strengh to the action).  This being said: what an amazing drawing skills you have in there. Really precise turn of the body. Congrats!
animation,3cd6lb,P4QO,1 point,Tue Jul 7 11:26:05 2015 UTC,"Could you elaborate about the movement looking as if it's in two steps? I'm not quite sure I'm following, but any advice you have to improve is definitely appreciated! Thanks for the kind words."
animation,3cd6lb,xAdzyy,2,Tue Jul 7 12:30:29 2015 UTC,"Of course. Now I have figured out what I think is the problem. I hope I can explain myself properly (english is not my strong).   If you look at the left arm, the one hitting, it charges in the middle of the movement: At first if follows the turn movement of the body, then, in the middle, it goes back to charge in one frame, and then continue turning with the body to hit. In terms of movement perception, you perceive that, happening that fast, as a break of the movement. That charge in the middle of the turn (the arm going back for one frame) breaks the action in two (breaks the fluidity). It is perceived as a charge and a recharge of the punch. Charge, stops, recharge and hit.  You are turning your body as a charge of the hit, you don't need to recharge again in the middle. Delete that frame and see if the entire movement gains fluidity.  Do not hesitate asking again if my explanation is unclear.  Edit: Perhaps you want that to happen that way. In that case, ignore everything I have said."
animation,3cekj3,MUHNAHDOH,4,Tue Jul 7 08:22:40 2015 UTC,"Draw, for one thing. Pick up a copy of Animator's Survival Kit and The Illusion of Life. As for software, to get started in 2d I'd go with Flash, just because it's cheap, but if you have more money pick up Toon Boom's Animate Pro. If you like 3d, ""industry standard"" is Maya, but you can do great stuff with Blender if you don't want to spend money. If you see yourself going more motion graphics I recommend Cinema 4D. After Effects is where you composite, and you'll need some kind of editing software as well, like Premiere or Final Cut Pro. Good luck!"

It's important to remember how bodyparts outside the screen affect what's happening on screen! For example, as he blows the balloon, you can really exaggerate the in and out pose by moving the hip back and forth, and really bending the spine as well.  Another detail that will improve this a lot are the eyes. We usually close/open our eyes somewhat faster than in this animation. :)  Good start, keep it up!"

It's one of those things that will go ""Click!"", and then you see the world in a whole new light (well, not quite that dramatic, but almost).  If you want to practice, try exaggerating the spine and hip poses until it looks silly. As he gathers air to blow the balloon, push the hip forward and curve the spine back. If you don't have a C-shaped character, you're not pushing it far enough!  More often than not, you'll find that the exaggerated-until-silly poses don't actually look half-bad. :)"

animation,3cabm0,pen0r,7,Mon Jul 6 11:46:02 2015 UTC,"He brings up a good point --- remember to ground yourself in reality when you're creating a cartoon.  He blows up the balloon to the point of BURSTING in just THREE breaths. That is really some incredible lung power.  I'm not saying the character shouldn't be able to do that... but if you want to ""sell"" it to the audience... he's gotta be turning purple... or taking some massively over-exeggerated inhalations. Either show us how hard he's working to blow that up so quick, or show us how incredible his lungs are.   Tap into your own experience and try to 'feel' what your character is going through. Think of the resistance a balloon really has when you're first blowing it up. Think about that moment of fear and anticipation as it gets bigger and bigger...about to pop at any moment.  Technically-speaking, the animation is well done! A few small errors like clipping of his fingers through the balloon. The character animation is good too, but I think could be pushed more! (Based on what I was explaining in the body of my post)"

The only things I would change is the first movement of the tongue (I would remove when it grows up or try to make it more fluid) and the sign of the end (you shouldn't understimate your cool ""dirty"" style of animation with that kind of sign, I would make it more standard, in a more serious way, to show that your style is a personal election and not the result of a lack of skills).

animation,3c9pxk,pixel_illustrator,1 point,Mon Jul 6 14:00:14 2015 UTC,"Yes, that. Lol sorry for the lack of clarity"
animation,3c9pxk,pixel_illustrator,1 point,Mon Jul 6 18:03:51 2015 UTC,"The short answer is ""No"". I have seen some people attempt things like automated tweening in pixel art but it doesn't really work, especially as you go smaller in terms of resolution. You are pretty much forced to hand draw every frame and move every pixel yourself, obviously you can cut parts out and move them to create some movement like squash and stretch, but movement of limbs for things like walk cycles and actions won't work.  The reason for this is that a big part of pixel art is making use of what little space you have, automated tweening and the like can't do that while making the art ""read"" at the same time because it will try to do things like dither the small pixel art which makes it look terrible.  You might see some simplistic animations handled by an automated system (think of stuff like characters swinging weapons in Terraria) but the way this works is not ""true"" pixel art because the artwork is blown up larger than its true pixel size so that it can be rotated without loss of hard edges."

Would a person truly hold their opposite arm straight down like that? By putting details and motion into the other arm, we could get a better sense of what's going through the mind of the character. Unless you're going for completely blank/stoic mannequins, learning to emote without words/faces is crucial.  Another thing to practice is to develop a sense of timing. I think you could have more variation in the movement (the speed of the motion seems a little too uniform and lifeless), and the main figure's movement is a little too slow overall for my taste.

I attended and took notes.  Specifically in Victoria: Victorian College of the Arts (VCA), RMIT, Deakin and Holmesglen all offer animation courses of one sort or another. Unsure of cost but then again, HECS. :)  When you say ""get into animation"", I'm not sure if you're asking how hard is it to learn how to animate, how hard is it to learn to make animated films, how hard is it to get into the animation industry.. ? I've got Australia-specific advice about the industry side of things which is likely more useful to you personally than USA-centric stuff, but which of those are you curious about?  In terms of expense, that's up to you. Flipbooks are cheaper than highly-polished CGI. Blender is cheaper than Maya. Biros are cheaper than Copic markers. Plasticine is cheaper than silicone. Webcams are cheaper than DSLRs. Preston Blair's ""Cartoon Animation"" is cheaper than Richard Williams's ""Animator's Survival Kit"". Distributing a DCP is cheaper than shipping polyester-based film. Limited animation is cheaper than full animation. And so on."

animation,3c2ofv,oposssom,2,Sat Jul 4 09:49:33 2015 UTC,How did you get into the course and what do they actually teach you?
animation,3c2ofv,quollism,2,Sun Jul 5 04:05:57 2015 UTC,"Read about applying here  Vauge Breakdown of Ciriculum:  -First Year: Mostly illustration and design with some animation  -Second Year first semester: Wide variety of animation to figure out what kind (2d/3d) you want to pursue further (some people also do stop motion)  -Second Year second semester: almost all electives, where you can choose to take 2D or 3D classes. 2D animation mostly uses TV paint. 3D mostly uses maya (i think, im not a 3D dude)  -Third Year: Make a short film, more electives  If you are really interested in becoming a great technical animator then you will probably be a bit disappointed with the course. I know I was. 2D people don't actually start learning the theory until half way through the second year, and for 3D people it's even later (a lot of 3D classes seem to be mostly focused on learning the software). Buuuuut on the other hand I don't think it actually matters that much. Unless your gonna go to one of the super amazing schools (calarts, animation workshop, gloebins) your university doesn't really matter (and honestly, even if you do go to those places). It's all about how motivated you are, and for a self motivated person RMIT is pretty great. The staff are really cool, the facilities are great, and everyone is the course is really supportive. Theres only like 50 a year so you get to know everyone, and it's really fun dorking out over animation with a bunch of other passionate people."

animation,3c2ofv,autowikibot,1 point,Mon Jul 6 04:58:31 2015 UTC,"Fair enough. There's a lot to know.  At this early stage, it's best to mentally separate the technology from what you do with the technology. You can draw frames to get animation, you can set keyframes on a digital puppet to get animation, you can sculpt plasticine or sand or whatever to get animation, but underpinning all of that are principles of animation that hold no matter what your medium. It's a technical art so you have to know the technology you're using as well as the principles which inform how you use that technology. Disney's guys discovered their famous 12 principles of animation which are a good start, but not everyone wants to make movies that look and feel like Disney.  If you want a run-down on the art and science of how to make characters move and look good, ""Animator's Survival Kit"" by Richard Williams is a top book. The knowledge in that is true for stop-mo, hand-drawn and CG alike in terms of how to get a character moving convincingly.  Then choose your medium. Everything's done on computers these days - stop motion (e.g. claymation like Aardman, real world puppet animation like Laika) is photographed and edited on a computer; hand-drawn animation (the majority of anime) is either scanned in and cleaned up on computer or drawn into computers directly using a graphics tablet; CG (Pixar) is typically created entirely in the computer (exceptions are things like when models are sculpted in clay then 3D-scanned in, e.g. Gollum in Lord of the Rings). All animation - film, games, whatever - ends up with moving images on a screen.  Let's say you want to go with 3D. Personally I'm working in 3D using Blender because it's free, does All The Things to some extent, there's a ton of tutorial material online as well as freely downloadable pre-made stuff and the community's very helpful. I can't speak from experience for Maya but it's the industry's standard software for animation - the animation competition site 11 Second Club has free Maya rigs in their Resources section which you can use to practice. In either software, you're blocking out the character's poses at particular moments, then finessing the transitions between those poses, then adding extra detail like clothes flapping, flesh wobbles etc.  tl;dr knowing how to animate is different from knowing how to use animation software, need to know both :)"
animation,3c2ofv,Dark_Souls,1 point,Tue Jul 7 10:44:43 2015 UTC,"12 basic principles of animation:       Disney's Twelve Basic Principles of Animation is a set of principles of animation introduced by the Disney animators Ollie Johnston and Frank Thomas in their 1981 book The Illusion of Life: Disney Animation. [a]  Johnston and Thomas in turn based their book on the work of the leading Disney animators from the 1930s onwards, and their effort to produce more realistic animations. The main purpose of the principles was to produce an illusion of characters adhering to the basic laws of physics, but they also dealt with more abstract issues, such as emotional timing and character appeal.

I had to go back and look at it after watching it through. On it's own it's beautiful, though a little ""flat"" animation wise. My point is, that was the only piece in the whole thing that would make me think ""hmmm maybe this guy won't pull off the job for me, that horse walk cycle look a little weak (stiff)"" If I hadn't seen that I would have been pumped and said ""who is this guy and can I hire him to do something for me!?""

The bow and arrow animation was made awhile ago when I was just starting to get a hang of things so it's not very good to be honest.

animation,3bzrgi,glimpee,2,Fri Jul 3 19:58:15 2015 UTC,"disclaimer: I hve no formal training, am in no way professional, and have VERY little animation experience  Here's my advice tho. Focus on weight/gravity. One thing thats strange is every jump he has results in a different fall speed. He also doesnt seem to contract enough when he lands. Your squirrel should work like a spring - since its just a ball.   Look up some bouncing ball animations. Watch the weight/gravity and look at how the ball compresses/decompresses  The goal is to make a consistant illusion of reality.  For this animation in specific, watch some ball animation tests  For further stuff, watch reality/videos of reality and try to relate that reality into your animation  Idk if this applies to you - but sometimes people will go into art without much thought process (myself included) meaning they kinda just freehand. I woul reccomend planning a bit more and thinking about the movement in every way. Think about how you can trick toe viewer into perceiving ""reality""  hope that helps"

I didn't go to school for animation, but I wasted a lot of time before figuring out what I wanted to do, so I'm not sure I have the best advice for you. If you can go to college for animation, you should, but it's not absolutely necessary. You're in a great position because you're young and know what you want. Just try to learn everything you can. Learn Flash, ToonBoom, and 3D. Try to learn at least one of those thoroughly. Take on a project and work on it from start to finish. Challenge yourself, and whatever you want to do but don't know how, Google it or reach out to the community for help. You'll never stop learning. Start applying for jobs whenever you feel you're ready to work. Chances are, you'll struggle at the start whether you went to school or not, but you'll be surrounded by other talented animators who will be able to help, and you'll get your hands on professional files. Just work very hard and be open to new knowledge. I learned software before I knew how to animate well, but I guess it could work the other way too. Be passionate about your work and you can't go wrong. Bah, I'm just rambling now. Let me know if you have any specific questions and I'll try to help. Good luck!"

Figure out what about them do you like and why.  It's a brutal industry. But practical model making and stop motion is making a come back. They need animators that can work in practical and digital.  Be open to learning and working hard.  The industry demands long hours and little job security. But it sure beats working in a bank! (Although the older I get the more it sounds appealing. Regular pay. Normal work hours. Low stress. No weekends..) Wishing you luck and keep drawing!"

If you KNOW you want to be an animator, go find an experienced animator who will agree to mentor you.  Ideally, this might be your high school art teacher.  Or maybe they can help you find the right person.  You'd benefit by some targeted help that can only come from an experienced person."

animation,3bwt1c,Nosirah,2,Thu Jul 2 20:14:56 2015 UTC,"Just a suggestion, but I'd pull the comics from the reel, usually you kind of keep one skill to a reel (or tailor the reel to what the job specifically requires I'd guess, say if they need a Generalist who can model, rig, and animate or a similar situation), but, to me comics seem more in place in a portfolio than a demo reel."
animation,3bwt1c,DeadAimHeadshot,2,Thu Jul 2 23:17:34 2015 UTC,"I'd disagree to that. Bigger companies tend to ONLY want 3D people now a days, and they want those 3D people to be really good at ONLY one thing as well. While smaller companies which tend to have more jobs for 2D artists. Like people with multiple talents. Unless you have a specific 2D company that is rather large in mind for applying to, I'd keep your comics to show your multi talented.  Also I like your reel, short to the point and only shows best work. Hope to see you in industry!"

animation,3bwaex,nicsonfire,2,Thu Jul 2 17:57:26 2015 UTC,"The second half of the animation looks good, my major complaint would be right after the toe tap when he first pushes into the block it seems awkward. Try acting it out. You'd tend to favor one side more when pushing something that heavy to gain leverage, but in the animation with the first push you have both of your arms twinning.   Try putting one shoulder more into it, even if its only slightly.  Also something feels funny about how he pushes back off the wall on that first push, possibly because you haven't begun much of your foot movement yet, feels like your kind of just rocking on that one foot planted too much.  one last thing, maybe have him look this big block up and down while tapping his foot, he just kind of blank stares into it rather than assessing the situation it seems. feels as if he's deep in thought, but not about moving the block.  Anyways, I'm just a student animator as well, so take these however you wish, it looks like it's heading in a good direction."

Second piece of advice is that it would be best to try and animate the walk in place when doing a cycle.  Other than that keep doing these types of exercises even after you get the hang of it. I've learned more in repeatedly doing an animation that kept messing up than listening to or watching my instructor.  Get it into muscle memory."

animation,3btpw5,minipizzabagels,3,Thu Jul 2 01:55:11 2015 UTC,cute.   your edit could be a little snappier. Trim a couple of frames here and there from shots to make the pacing work better.   The cut between the chef inspecting the finished sashimi so seriously and then doing the fangirl swoon is a little weird. The switch of emotions is a little sudden.   The intro title could be sped up a lot more. Just make it quick and punchy  But all in all it's great. All my comments are really just minor edit tweaks. The short works well together.

Yes, his boots should flex at the end of the stride, but then they should quickly go back to a normal state until they hit the ground again.  Walk in front of a mirror and observe how your shoes look when you are taking a stride and try to emulate that as best as you can.   Good job otherwise, I like the style."
animation,3brybg,LaustinDWoods,1 point,Wed Jul 1 19:35:24 2015 UTC,"There are lots of little issues. It would help if you really simplified your model before animating it.  His geometry is so complicated that it makes the lack of animation on him stand out more.  It's been mentioned already that the arm need to move opposite the leg and you have really floppy feet. Part of this is likely because you don't have a good extension in your passing pose.  (Here is where a simpler design can aid you better.) You need to incorporate your torso into the movement too. As it is now, it still needs some rotations between the hips and the shoulders. In a simpler design such as a cylinder body, you can fake the hip shoulder rotation by translating the arms back more from the shoulder. Also, not having the belt pouch to track, would help give the illusion that the hips are rotating a little more.  It would also be nice to see the neck and head as part of the cycle. The cycle has numerous little hiccups where it looks like the shoulders and gun pop. You need to track the arcs at both the wrist and the shoulder to make this happen."

animation,3bsf2l,MoonFetish,2,Wed Jul 1 19:42:47 2015 UTC,"You can bring FLV files in and out of After Effects. I've never tried both myself, but I'd wager you can take advantage of features both programs specialize for whatever a shot demands."
animation,3bsf2l,1brokenmonkey,2,Wed Jul 1 20:43:16 2015 UTC,"The standard approach used by most studios is to export your animation from Flash as a SWF movie; either one for the whole shot, or multiple SWFs for characters, props, limbs, etc. that demand to be separated if your composite is particularly complex. (For instance: In your rendition of The Sorcerer's Apprentice, you may need to apply a glow & parent a particle emitter to the sorcerer's hat, without affecting the apprentice who's wearing it.)  Simply, After Effects can import SWF files as footage. Therefore, anything you can apply to footage in AE such as effects, expressions, parenting, 3D transforms, track mattes, etc. can be utilized by each SWF you bring into the comp.   In addition, you'll need to remember to export from Flash a separate audio WAV file, since After Effects cannot currently grab the embedded audio from the SWF directly. (This is assuming you've assembled the audio track within Flash, otherwise the common tactic is to utilize pre-cut audio from your animatic.)  SWF's big advantage over intermediate video formats such as AVIs, MOVs, etc. is that SWF files are resolution-independent vector sequences -- they will indefinitely scale up and down without aliasing, so long as you remember to check the 'Continuously Rasterize' toggle for each SWF you bring into your comp. This will keep 'em nice and sharp if you do a lot of varied camera work such as truck ins and outs.  For this reason, one basic (and common) use for After Effects that might not be obvious is pairing your animation with high-resolution BGs and assets that would likely give you major performance problems if you tried to import it straight into Flash. This, in addition to obvious usage like greater 2D+3D camera capability, varied effects and plugins, etc. makes AE an attractive tool of choice to assemble your final comps.  In ""Salad Fingers"", AE appears to be utilized for it's 3D camera (possibly using 'wiggle' expressions for some subtle camera shake), some selective depth-of-field blurring, and adjustment layers for color grading; among other things."
animation,3bsf2l,cheesewedge86,2,Thu Jul 2 15:44:42 2015 UTC,"WOW, thank you so much. Super helpful.  So if I'm importing SWFs and using HR backgrounds, am I able to have a transparent background, or do I have to key out the SWF background in AE?"
animation,3bsf2l,cheesewedge86,2,Fri Jul 3 02:42:27 2015 UTC,"Nope! The SWF imports with it's own alpha channel; no keying required. :) Alternatively, you can choose to premultiply a matte color of your choosing under the SWF's 'Interpret Footage' options."

My only other experience with vectors was inkscape though, which doesn't really seem designed to handle vectors in a raster way, so just being able to erase part of a vector line was pretty cool to me.   It should be noted that I'm also very new to digital drawing (and only recently got back into drawing at all), so I quite enjoy having the smoothing event that vectors give.   Raster is definitely better for maintaining the character of your actual strokes, if that's your sort of thing."

When he first pushes the bag it should swing out as far as its ever gonna go, then, especially after hitting the guy, it's going to slow down with each swing. The laws of gravity and force are being broken right now because it seems the bag is swinging faster and faster until it completely breaks off the rope. I think you should keep the end and just make the first swing (after he pushes it) much bigger, maybe even have it swing off screen, you could have a funny moment where the guy thinks its completely gone (maybe dusts off his hands with a sense of accomplishment) then WAM!! it comes flying back into screen and hits him.

It's good to have things like motion blur, stretching and squishing and whatnot, but the vertical size of the sandbag (I mean its size along the axis of the rope) has no reason to change while the rope is intact. The size difference between the initial state of the sandbag and the moment it hits the guy is a bit too much.  Keep up the good work."
animation,3bp59c,kageoushou,7,Wed Jul 1 00:43:54 2015 UTC,"Where you go to school doesnt really matter, its what you do at school that matters. It only gives you a little street cred. Your reel is key. Keep it under :30 seconds if you can. What kind of animation specifically are you looking to get into? 3d, 2d, Motion graphics, character animation? Or do you want to be a specialist and focus on rigging, lighting, or texturing. Flash is going away, what about HTML 5 animation? Hand drawn animation/ cel animation? Depending on your path, you can expect to find little work to lots of work. Also consider where you want to live. Places like NY and LA have the movie / tv industries, but do you want to go to New Orleans or Vancouver or London where they have tax credits and VFX companies are moving to as a result?  Everyone wants to be freelance right out of school. The best advice I can give you is to put in your time at a real shop or studio and then go freelance if thats what you really want. Otherwise you will know nothing, and finding jobs is going to be difficult. You can also risk ruining your reputation in the local area/ job market by marketing yourself as being able to do something and you cant.  Dont copy and paste your cover letter. Its so annoying when I get cover letters in 6 fonts and sizes that have been copied and pasted over generations of applications. Its a clear sign the person is grabbing at straws for a job, and they haven't taken the time to research my company or what we do. Nobody expects you to know everything (or anything) coming out of school - but your attitude and willingness to learn and put in the extremely long hours is going to be key to your future.

Similarly, if you have a skill that you think they may not be looking for, you may not even mention it all, or mention it in passing.

animation,3bp1v1,MythBrains,2,Wed Jul 1 00:07:12 2015 UTC,"Pretty solid animation, it's kind of difficult to see it properly without a background or ground plane of some sort. Honestly anything would probably work something that I used to do when I was making sprite animations was, either use a game background, or simply make a gradient, and cut it off suddenly. That way you kind of get a very basic horizon line. You need something to, ironically(?) ground the animation so the sprites aren't just jumping around in a blank space. The sound effects work pretty well for it, but you may want to add a little more timing between strikes. If you're using Flash you can kind of squeeze the sprites to get between-frames for more appropriate timing and weight."

When the lantern is swinging and when he jumps out of the ground the movement is pretty uniform. With the lantern, there should be more frames at the end of the arch, as it slows down and reverses motion, and less frames in the middle. For the jump, you want more frames at the top of the arch as gravity slows down his upward motion and begins to pull him back down, then less frames as he's accelerating."

Well played XD.  I think just a little movement on all that arm would help it though, just to make it look a bit more fluid.  Perhaps just a little rotation of it, but not enough to determine whether it's an arm swinging or a loose sleeve flapping.  Otherwise, very unique and fun!"

To the technicals:  Animation is almost never easy but some tools are better for beginners than others.   For that short, I'd recommend something like After Effects or Anime Studio Pro. These will allow you to puppet your characters without having to draw out every single frame.   It looks like it was done in Photoshop and animated in After Effects. Anime Studio is a bit cheaper to own outright and comes with a set of vector drawing tools though you can draw your characters in Photoshop/GIMP/Krita"

animation,3bk88w,Gollomor,1 point,Mon Jun 29 23:25:53 2015 UTC,I am thinking about to buy some Cels from this show or others too. How much did u pay for each ? Or what is a good and Fair price?  It seems like the most ones on ebay are very expensive.
animation,3bk88w,DCanon,1 point,Tue Jun 30 23:01:53 2015 UTC,"they varied, one cost 50, one cost 170 one cost 280.  The one that's signed cost 280 on ebay.  The other one cost 170 in an ebay bid.  The one that cost 50 was bought with 11 other cels in a deal that I brokered after buying 2 cells earlier from them on ebay.   Tricky thing is pretty much all the good cels are taken. Most of what's left are odds and ends or have characters with closed eyes. You might find a background sold on ebay every once and a while, they usually sell for over 250 bucks due to rarity.  Even my cels are kind of all odds and endsy, I got lucky with the happy helmet scene, without the other 2 cels there wouldn't be much context to what it even is.  Also you want a cel with both characters in their stock clothing. Not in an army uniform or fireman costume.  Be careful you're buying stuff from the first 2 seasons. Steer clear of nurse stimpy episodes, that one wasn't worked on by John K.  So most of what you see on ebay these days will have these kinds of problems, there are pencil drawings on sale, some aren't bad and they're not as valuable as cels but if it's a really important pencil, like the character sheet of a major character on the show or of an icon (like powdered toast man) you might be able to find something like that.  Water colors are where it's at. Any of those still shots they did in watercolor or backgrounds are worth a lot of money due to ultra rarity.  So expect to see a cel unframed and not a master piece go up for sale on ebay for starting at 56 bucks and it'll go up from there depending on what it is. If it's an iconic masterpiece it could start at 200.  With frame it costs more. Der."

Most of the time they're done in flash, but there isn't a set rule really.  Anything could work.  you could animate it in photoshop if you have the patience.  Try getting a copy of flash and playing around to see what you can figure out.  If you get stuck there are 11 millions billion flash tutorials on youtube."
animation,3bfi5u,YOYOCOOLC27,14,Sun Jun 28 19:36:10 2015 UTC,"First of all - Very nice!   The fall to the floor - it feels too soft. I think there are too much frames during his fall. Cut down one or two frames before he contacts the ground. When he is on the ground, his posture ""hints"" that most of his weight is on his left arm (right arm from camera-angle), and then that arm moves like he's not really resting on it. It de-suspends the disbelief :)   Keep workin' those frames son!"
animation,3bfi5u,yamtal,3,Sun Jun 28 20:40:33 2015 UTC,"Agreed. If he's really that inebriated, would he have the reflexes to catch himself so quickly? Maybe he catches himself a little late and bonks his head on the sidewalk."
animation,3bfi5u,darthV8R,7,Mon Jun 29 04:02:42 2015 UTC,"Good to see Norman still getting some play :D    One of the biggest issues is ankles at feet.  After the fall, they are literally broken.  Poor guy is drunk and crippled now.  Acting-wise, I think you're missing a lot of opportunity.  Drunk people move a lot, especially when trying to get towards a target.  They are off balance, constantly trying to get balanced, failing, retrying, etc.  Shuffling a lot. Wobbly head. Your guy is pretty static.  I can tell that he's near a door, but not that he cares at all about getting to the door or getting inside.  He doesn't really ever look @ the doorknob from this camera angle.  Never reaches for it.  Hope that helps!"
animation,3bfi5u,jwondrusch,2,Sun Jun 28 20:58:30 2015 UTC,The balance thing is the only thing I (beginner animator) noticed the lack of. It's really good except for that part.
animation,3bfi5u,Neijo,6,Sun Jun 28 21:17:34 2015 UTC,"Edit: My critiques are pretty harsh- if you can't take a harsh critique save yourself and don't read this one, my intent is to push people to be better animators but every so often people take it as a personal attack.  To me this looks more like someone very ill or dieing- it doesn't read as drunk and probably wouldn't to most people if you hadn't told them.  Part of the performance is thinking what the character would think to figure out how they should act and one of the really interesting things about a drunk character is-  When a (bad) actor is acting the part of a drunk he thinks ""I'm drunk"" and tends to act silly and drunk and plays it up. It can be funny but it's not at all believable.  However, when an actual person is drunk, what do they think? Most of the time THEY think, ""I'm not drunk"". Or ""I can do this."" There's a lot of drunken stubborn assholes, and their judgement is heavily distorted, what the character is thinking is different than what reality is and that is a challenge you've got to recognize if you want to animate a believable character. What's his goal? What's his physical obstacle?   At the moment it's ""I might get to the door but I'm drunk so I'm just going to get sick here and give up.""   I think a stronger performance might be one that displays the character's struggle to get to the door, fighting with his own balance issues and pushing forward because he is trying to play it off. If he were being silly for his friends that'd be a bit of a different thought process and challenges, but by himself he's just trying to get to that door and probably fighting back the urge to spew- there's just no fight in this guy.  You've got the ability to pose and animate, but if you really want to push yourself I'd focus on the performance- thumbnail out your scene and YOU make the decisions before you even touch that program! Otherwise you have no idea where you're going with a scene, and if it's a surprise to you as much as everyone else your staging and performance is likely going to be weak."
animation,3bfi5u,AvidLebon,1 point,Mon Jun 29 02:40:41 2015 UTC,"Hey I don't take this as a personal attack at all haha, thanks for the advice I'll definitely try to focus on everything you said. I did post an updated gif in the comments though, do you mind taking a look at that and letting me know what you think? Again, I appreciate your time to look at this stuff!"
animation,3bfi5u,AvidLebon,2,Mon Jun 29 02:52:24 2015 UTC,"Oh good.Well the second one has more determination, it looks at the door so seeing the characters objective strengthens it- though overall it still reads as sick for me. Perhaps look up some reference videos, maybe something like... before he's against the side of the house he's walking toward the door but since he's been drinking and he's kind of off balance (dunno if you've been drunk but it's kinda like being dizzy, kinda like balancing on the floor as IT is moving- that's what it feels like...) So he's trying to balance, and walk, but into the side of the building he goes. I mean, if you want it to read as drunk, depending on what you want out of a performance you've got to decide how much you want your audience to know- and if drunk is what you want them to take away from it perhaps adding some off balance movement before or after your current action would help that read better.  I will advocate for reference- for little practice pieces sometimes I just fool around but without planning they don't get much farther than a walk or a jump. I'd suggest you storyboard it, or video record yourself, write it up or use video reference, Video reference is GREAT to learn from life, we are imitating life so no reason to deprive yourself that reference. If I were to guess I'd think you were winging it- but a large part of that guess is because that's what I see most newer students doing- the ones that have the stellar performances usually had planning and/or reference to work from."

You want it to look like he has lost his shit, but is desperately trying to make it appear like he's got it under control.  Anyway, hope that's useful!  Keep at it :)"

When someones drunk they're like a liquid, balance is off, etc.  he should have to work a lot harder to regain his balance  for example  when he falls - his shoulders should fall a lot further, and then he should bring himself back up clumsily  Good start though, just add in some flowing motions and footwork"

I think for something like your talking about your best option would be to hire freelancers online.  Find a bunch of different individuals and hire them each to do a sequence or whatever.  I doubt you would even be able to get a bite from a Korean studio for something like this.  For the most part they're already producing most of the cartoons that come on TV, so a small project like this wouldn't be worth it for them.

Here's a few: -the guy in army pants jumping - His feet stay flat when his knees are very bent before and after he lands. (Try bending your knees very low and notice your heel does not stay flat.)  -girl lifting weight - Barbell should fall faster and bounce less (It feels too light.) Her body after she lifts the barbell feels very IK especially when she is squatting down. (Her torso has a lot of movement, but the barbell stays relatively still.) Again, don't be afraid to lift those heels when squatting. He arms get hyper extended in the initial lift. The weight is being held behind her head, not over it. I'm not sure if it's physically possible to hold such a heavy weight that far back. (At least my arms barely bend that way, let alone holding weight.) Her right knee has a wobble outwards when she squats, then her right foot rotates when she stands. Supporting legs shouldn't just swivel.  In general, it's not bad.

animation,3bcd11,Gippeus,16,Sat Jun 27 21:45:53 2015 UTC,"The biggest difference is that in shows/films, the camera is fixed, and you almost never re-use animation; but in the majority of 3D games, the camera can move, and there are several animations that wil be reused over and over again(e.g. runs, walks, climbing, action). This means that in film and shows, you have much more agency to be able to cheat in an animation; an example would be a shot is from the chest up, so you dont even care what happens below the waist AT ALL. Also, you focus on making the line of motion fit with the camera, and it doesnt matter if the action seems clunky from the other side.  With games however, you will see a singular animation over and over, and from nearly every angle, so you have to make sure the animation looks good from every angle, and you can't cheat the animation almost at all. A lot of this of course doesnt apply to in-game cinematics."

animation,3bcd11,kylerk,4,Wed Jul 1 01:36:26 2015 UTC,"I'd suggesting reading this book on Game Feel.  It really explains what illusion your trying to create with game animation.  It's not the illusion of life like regular old animation, it's the illusion of control, though in some ways it's not an illusion because you actually have it.  I'd say that book is required reading for anybody getting into the games industry.  And from a different perspective, I really like the fact that when you animate something for a game, there is a good chance that the work your doing will get used an incredible amount of times.  Consider a walk cycle.  Making the perfect walk in a film might get made once, but making a perfect walk cycle in a game could be used hundreds of thousands of time by millions of people.  I find that more motivating than trying to animate a walk that is only going to be seen for 1 second.  From a technical perspective, I'd say that if you are strong technically, using software and perhaps programming a bit, you can really dig in further in meaningful ways in games.  And from a financial sense, I think there is way more money flowing into games than there is for film.  There is a billion dollar industry where people are used to buying little apps, PC games, and Console game at the indie level.  If you compare that to the film animation industry, reguarly people don't really buy indie level animation enmass.  It is a niche field where most of the money lies in advertising or holly wood.  Not that I'm making tons of money from games yet, but I at least see a path forward.  If you have any questions I'd be happy to answer.  I'm a 2D/3D animator who is founding a game company."

animation,3bcd11,lucio360,2,Sun Jun 28 21:25:34 2015 UTC,"Animating for films and games are totally different beasts. The locations where you can get game work and film work don't always overlap. Generally it's easier to get work in games, as games is a bigger industry than film right now, the talent threshold is higher for film, and the amount of game titles pushed out (especially when you consider pc games, console, and phone) greatly exceed the films that need animation work. Mocap is used for both films and games these days, but generally a lot more for games. In film you will work on a few shots at a time and spend weeks to even months on them. In games you will need to do cycles and animation geared to the game action, not the shot, in a much faster timeframe. The closest common ground between the two is doing cinematics. If you're interested in that, there are a bunch of companies that specialize in only that. It's like working on a game but you have shots like a film. Word of warning: You need to have a really good reel to get work animating for film, especially if you're right out of school, it must be distinguished from other student work. Like having a short film accepted into festivals like SIGGRAPH. Have you narrowed to a specialty yet? I'm assuming you're a 3D animator but within that there's character and fx animation, aside from all the other things you can do in 3D. Fx anim is quite technical. The thing about 3D character animation is that it's REALLY popular to learn, but a fairly limited amount of jobs. They say that if you're really talented, and your reel shows it, you can always get work. Good luck!"

Not exactly a cheap program to get the pro one (the one with the smart bones), but quite possibly worth it for the amount of work it could save.

I know when I first got AS, I bought an old version (8) from amazon for like 20 bucks, then updated when version 10 came out, to get smart bones and stuff, and overall was a lot cheaper than buying 10 outright.  just checked, physical copy of pro 10 is like $170.  physical copy of 9.5 (also has smart bones) is $69  There are a few features added in version 10 that may make things a little easier (as I'm sure there is with 11) but you should be able to use the smart bones in 9.5 to do anything you want.  But yeah, as far as cutout animation, and skeletal movement, Anime Studio is the best I've found.  Any bone animation is going to have a lot of limitations compared to frame by frame, but AS offers the most work arounds for that.  Unfortunately AS probably also offers the least in terms of frame by frame.. but it is ""technically possible"" to do."

The price for 9.5 sounds very right, especially if it contains the smartbones.    Looking at this guy's work, which appears to have the range of movement (and level of detail) that I'm looking for, it looks like version 9.5 should contain all the features I need.

The character looks great, but with the focal point being us looking at the nail, I would add a little more to look at with the nail.  Keep up he good work!"

animation,3bai50,remedialrob,1 point,Sat Jun 27 21:37:30 2015 UTC,"When you hit a nail, you don't instantly remove the hammer, it presses against the nail for a brief moment before you pull it back. Ie the nail doesn't move forward by itself, but because there is a hammer pushing it in.  You want to show the audience that the hammer stays on the nail for as long as it moves."

animation,3bbjjc,madafaku,1 point,Sun Jun 28 04:05:15 2015 UTC,"very good for your first attempt.  The running came off a little stiff, maybe next time add some more body and movement, it just seemed like just his arms legs and hair moving, and his torso was perfectly still.  but like I said very good, especially for your first try.  Keep it up.  I would definitely recommend picking up the animators survival kit from amazon, and check some youtube tutorials out.  but I'm of the opinion that animation school is great for networking, but everything else you can teach yourself.  The people who created the fundamentals of animation never went to animation school, animation school didn't exist before them.  This industry is 50% content of your portfolio, 49% who you know, and >1% what school you went to."

The rotoscopy is mixed with free drawings.  Record a video, convert the frame ratio to 18 fps (old movies format), print the frames, use a lightbox (a used to use a window) to  trace the image with watercolours (trace the level of detail that you choose), paint also wathever you want that is not in the original image (like the water on the video from when he jumps in to a puddle), then scan the frames and put all together in a video editor. The result could be very similar after some postproduction modifications.   Edit: This is a very simplistic view of what I think they did (the real process should have been much more complicated)."

The art pen, for example, give the result of a real brush since it will percept rotations, movement and pressure on another level compared to a regular pen.

animation,3b2q9m,arturovargas16,3,Fri Jun 26 00:55:41 2015 UTC,"was a big fan of the series, as well as the prequel they had (Dofus) that will probably be more akin to the movie than Wakfu itself. That being said, as animation it coulda been a LOT better. Flash rigging was apparent all over, even if I loved the character design, sets, and story.  For those who aren't fans of the series and want to watch it purely for animation, I'd recommend the ""special"" episodes that were hand drawn in correlation with Japanese studios. For instance, ""Ogrest, the Legend"" was animated in part by Ghibli! And another good standalone short, ""Noximillien the Watchmaker"" was animated by Madhouse I believe, the same guys who brought us, ""Kaiba"" and the director of ""Ping Pong"" did character design for that episode.   tl;dr if you wanna watch this purely for animation, there are really only two episodes for that. The rest is just if you like the story and sets. Those two episodes are ""Noximilien l'Horloger"" and ""Ogrest la Légende"""

It doesn't matter how well your back posture is if you need to tilt your head forward the entire time, all that'll do is remove back pain and increase shoulder/neck pain. I had a similar problem when I first got the same cintiq, animated bent over for 10 hours out of hype and woke up next morning with backpain so bad that I had to stay in bed all day.  Find a way to mount/elevate the cintiq to hold it higher and angled in a way where you don't need to look as steeply downward. There's a lot of diy guides for that online. Also, move around when you can. Don't animate for 3 hours straight, stand up every 30 minutes and stretch your shoulders, neck, and arms before getting back to work. 15 second breaks every 30 minutes won't decrease productivity and it'll minimize injury from long term strain."

To do this, try and attending open life drawing sessions with a model or take a course at a community college. Additionally  carrying a sketchbook and drawing people whenever you have a chance is another good solution but ideally you want to be doing both as much as you can. With enough practice posing your character will slowly become easier.  Also, don't mistake a walk cycle as beginner assignment, animating a convincing walk at least, is one of the harder things to do as everyone is essentially an expert since we see people walk every day."
animation,3b3i6j,Akhen,1 point,Thu Jun 25 19:19:03 2015 UTC,"For myself I started with stop motion/claymation, so having animated in a 3D space helps me imagine my drawings to have more depth.  I also think it's harder to feel depth while working with stick figures which can make certain things harder or easier to animate. My best advice would be tostart small, try to visualize it, and just keep at it until you're satisfied!"

animation,3b2dm6,melody_loom,2,Thu Jun 25 12:24:55 2015 UTC,"The question you have to ask yourself is ""Am I Good Enough"" and ""Do I have the drive"".  Anyone can get a degree in animation. Schools will be more than happy to relieve you of that sack o' money, but those two questions are what will determine your personal success.  Animation is an ""All or Nothing"" career. Either you are really fucking good and you do well in your career, or you're not, and so you don't.  Kind of like Law School, there are ""Tier 1"" schools, and then there is everything else. And kind of like Law School, if you aren't in Tier 1, it is very unlikely you ever will be successful. This is because the talent curve with animation is very steep, so if you were any good, you'd be at a good school. (Though that is not to say you have to go to school to be good)  Even at the best schools, there is a substantial gradient of talent. So if you aren't in the top third, of a tier 1 school, then you're in trouble.   Lastly, always remember, Art School is where you go to DO art, not where you go to LEARN art from scratch. You need to go into it ready to produce art."

animation,3b2dm6,treelaunka,1 point,Fri Jun 26 00:51:00 2015 UTC,"I would suggest doing that-- and replicating animation you like. Go to CTNX in CA this year, and take some cheap lectures. I bought about 18 for around 250, and learned a lot. One was replicating 2d scenes, but in a different scale, so you couldn't possibly trace. It teaches you a lot."
animation,3b2dm6,Palfie,2,Fri Jun 26 20:23:03 2015 UTC,"Since you already have a degree, I'd recommend not going to art school. You'll always have something to fall back on with that, so you can take bigger risks in the extremely competitive animation industry.  Instead, I'd start buying up all the educational materials you would get in an animation program, and teach yourself as much as you can. There's the Richard Williams book and lectures, Gnomon DVDs, all the other great animation books, etc.  No one will ever ask for your diploma, they only need to see your demo reel. Just start making animation! Sign up for the Creative Cloud subscription and dive into after effects and flash and photoshop animation. It's $50/mo for ALL the industry standard software. Toon Boom has also just started a subscription model, it's never been cheaper to get rolling with digital tools.  Art school is increasingly, ridiculously expensive. Unfortunately unless you're a rockstar, you won't be making big money to pay that all back, and even with a job in animation it'll take 15 years to pay back just the tuition at a place even as lowly as art institute.  I went to art school straight out of highschool. I needed the transitional period into adulthood, I needed someone there to tell me what to do, where to look for answers, HOW to learn. I watched people who were mediocre coming in stay mediocre all the way through, thinking that finishing the program would land them a job. Maybe 1 in 3 of my graduating class got any work. If you already have study skills, the only thing you're missing out on is connections with fellow students, who may one day be connections into jobs in the industry.  Go to animation meetups, make friends online on animation boards like this one, you can get the same connections if you put yourself out there.  Save yourself hundreds of thousands of dollars, have a good demo reel sooner, and you'll have just as much of a chance as anyone who went to art school.  Good luck!"

I'm really inspired by this, it's amazing to think I can go out there and get this with my own ability rather than depanding on a school to guide me to the finish line.

I personally like TVpaint a little more as it has brushes and drawing tools that are closer to Photoshop. However incredible work is done in both, it's whichever you're more comfortable with. I'd download the demos of each and give them a shot!  If you want to go really traditional though, you'll need to set up a pencil-tester and scanner. I believe there's free software for it online, but you'll have to do some research. The only paper-animation I've done was in school and we used DigiCel flipbook, which I thought was AWFUL. I think the toonboom suite has a pencil test utility too.  Also, get Richard William's Book, 'The Animator's Survival Kit' it's the most sacred text in animation and a fantastic starting point. There's a digital version for iPad that I've heard great things about with all the animated examples embedded into the text.  Have fun learning!"

I'm not super familiar with either of those formats, but animation is essentially just a frame number and XYZ coordinates, and probably some tangency angles/lengths (or handle relative XY coordinates). Depending on the scripting capabilities of the program(s) you're using it shouldn't be difficult to write out of one and into another (assuming you can either apply or parse the file).  I don't know of any push-button solutions though I haven't gone looking.  Hope this helps."

animation,3awygj,morganselah,2,Wed Jun 24 04:13:11 2015 UTC,"She appears to be a animator working out the action within a single key-frame in 'The Wind Rises'.  Before starting a new key drawing during animation, it is helpful to first establish a sort of time-spacial context to your drawing... mapping out the action you're about to draw, based on when it's supposed to happen, as timed-out and indicated on your exposure sheet.  If you look closely to her right, you'll notice the corner of a yellow 'X-sheet' kept close at all times. It is a spreadsheet that lists each frame of a sequence in descending-ordered rows. Working with a stopwatch, an animator can pre-plan, frame-for-frame, the major actions and dialogue of a shot before committing to drawing.  Example X-sheet: http://wireframes.linowski.ca/wp-content/themes/darwin/images/full134.jpg  On a brief note, the X-sheet has been largely rendered obsolete within the modern animation industry, owing to the advent of 'paperless' digital animation. Today, an animator has the luxury of overlaying the timed-out storyboards (animatic) against his/her shot on the computer screen for reference. In the case of 'The Wind Rises', the old-school, traditional paper workflow demands the use of X-sheets for timing reference.  To begin, the first thing the animator does is position a punched photocopy of the shot's storyboard panel on the table. She'll use this as a rough guide for staging the characters.  Before making any marks, she uses her hand to act as a sort of visual 'anchor' for whatever she is picturing in her mind's eye; mentally-projecting it onto the paper surface. Note that where her hand rests is approximately the point where the character grips her umbrella... having not yet seen 'The Wind Rises', I'm going to assume some stuff about the shot. Mainly, that the umbrella is a major affector of the character's movement -- possibly jostling her around in the wind -- and therefore, must be plotted out first for this duet of pushing-and-pulling to look natural. In this particular moment, the umbrella is probably moving toward screen right; 'east' in animation camera terms. She makes note of this.  With the shot timing and actions thoroughly memorized, she refers to her X-sheet and makes note of the exact frame number her new key corresponds to in the sequence. Quick mental math gives her the fraction-of-a-second she'll need to hit with her stopwatch. Starting the clock, she motions her hand east in an arc-like trajectory -- adhering to the 12 principles of animation -- then stops when her target second is reached.  Using her hand as a reference point, she now knows where and how to rough out the forms that represent the umbrella canopy and shaft, as it occurs during that precise moment in the sequence. And, with her spacial context established, she can take the rest of the drawing through to completion.  Rinse and repeat hundreds of times more. :)"
animation,3awygj,cheesewedge86,1 point,Thu Jun 25 11:10:54 2015 UTC,"Section 8. Arc of article  12 basic principles of animation:       Most natural action tends to follow an arched trajectory, and animation should adhere to this principle by following implied ""arcs"" for greater realism. This can apply to a limb moving by rotating a joint, or a thrown object moving along a parabolic trajectory. The exception is mechanical movement, which typically moves in straight lines.   As an object's speed or momentum increases, arcs tend to flatten out in moving ahead and broaden in turns. In baseball, a fastball would tend to move in a straighter line than other pitches; while a figure skater moving at top speed would be unable to turn as sharply as a slower skater, and would need to cover more ground to complete the turn.  An object in motion that moves out of its natural arc for no apparent reason will appear erratic rather than fluid. Therefore when animating (for example) a pointing finger, the animator should be certain that in all drawings in between the two extreme poses, the fingertip follows a logical arc from one extreme to the next. Traditional animators tend to draw the arc in lightly on the paper for reference, to be erased later.

animation,3as8cr,PaterBinks,5,Tue Jun 23 09:42:06 2015 UTC,"My name is Josiah Haworth, i am one of the creators of Brain Divided. We created this short during our Junior and Senior Year at College. At the time our biggest inspirations were Osmosis Jones, Reason and Emotion and Emperors New Groove.   During the end of pre-production for Brain Divided, Pixar announced Inside Out, and we were excited that we were thinking along the same lines. Its great to see people becoming interested in the short again thanks to Inside Out, which has been in development many years before ours. Inside Out was an awesome movie, and a touching story. I absolutely loved it and its now one of my favorite Pixar movies.  In the end, any similarities in concept are coincidental, and neither Brain Divided nor Inside out Stole from each other or really knew each other existed until they were both nearly finished.  I hope everyone enjoyed our short film, and if you didn't, i will definitely keep doing my best to entertain in the future. :)"

animation,3as8cr,Unggoy,2,Tue Jun 23 22:17:06 2015 UTC,"Inside Out isn't an altogether original idea. I remember a cartoon in a comic I used to read as a kid which was pretty much the same idea. There's nothing wrong with that though, the concept shouldn't be the thing that drives a story, it should be the characters and the objectives of those characters - along with the resulting conflict. Pixar does that well, not only do they have awesome concepts, but they have so many layers of story and character development.  Regardless, this short isn't similar to Inside Out, and even the premise isn't that similar. Inside Out is about the brain being split up by emotion, rather than the sort of right/left brain mentality that this short works with."

It can be a bit of a grind sometimes, but there's a moment when you get the timing and all that just right, and the animation comes to life that makes it all worth it. Anyway your questions!    Autodesk Maya is probably your best bet for an all in one solution. Seems to be the usual professional standard. Lots of people preach Cinema 4D as well but I'm not really knowledgeable about that.    For actually modeling you might wanna take a look at Zbrush. Can be very useful for modeling and texturing, especially with the new ZModeler tool. I find myself in Zbrush more and more, though you'll need Maya or 4D for rigging and animation, plus Zbrush is a lot better with a Wacom tablet.    A lot of choices for this. Personally I enjoy Adobe After Effects. It's quite a versatile program + if you get Adobe creative cloud you'll get access to photoshop, illustrator, and Flash which you never know, might come in handy on such an ambitious project.    Some other tips (that you didn't ask for :P) , you won't finish rigging the characters and all of a sudden know how to animate. Definitely will need lots of tutorials and theory. Read up on the 12 principles of animation. In fact get the book ""The illusion of life""  + The animator's survival kit. Both are insanely good books on animation. Has helped me go from rookie to somewhat not terrible at animation haha. Practice practice practice!   Also with a project like this (and any animation really) I've come to learn extensive planning is critical. Write a script, storyboard (maybe even storyboard twice!), shoot some simple reference video of the more complex movements, do a crude pre-viz animatic. All this will help take your animation to the level you're dreaming about! Hope this helps!"

I love the idea of using puppet animation. It works well for ambient stuff without much movement.  You have a lot of jerky animation in there though, like the first breath or the dropping of the cube.  The arm coming back after releasing the cube looks like a broken elbow waiting to happen. :P  The animation over all IS good. Don't get me wrong, but overall it is too isolated. Each body part is moving almost completely on its own, when the entire body needs to be involved in some form in all actions. An example could be that when he does bring his hand back after holding out the cube, he needs to move his upper arm at least, as part of the move.  The other thing is it looks like you're using After effects default linear interpolation. You could either throw the translation channels into the graph and edit them there, or throw on easy-ease's into the keyframes. Without that things move... well... linearly and also come to a complete halt instantly, jarringly.  Keep at it, this is a nice style. Look forward to the next post (which I'm sure will come if you're commissioning these things). :)"
animation,3apur6,Dark_Souls,5,Mon Jun 22 16:52:21 2015 UTC,"I did draw it. Basically, the customer had reference art of his character already, which I had to adhere to but still draw for myself. I just didn't come up with the details of his body shape and color except for clothing. The backgrounds are my original work too.  I think you're right about the jerkiness and isolation of some movements, which I tried to address in making it. This was a really complex rig by my standards and my third time doing it in this style. I expect it'll take a few more jerky attempts to get that fluid movement just right.  I'm sure the best solution for me at this stage would be to look over tutorials on translation channels, which I have yet to take full advantage of. I've gotten used to their interface in Flash, but After Effects is still throwing me for a loop.  So thanks for the advice. It definitely helps."
animation,3apur6,Dark_Souls,3,Mon Jun 22 17:16:03 2015 UTC,"re: translation channels. If you drill down in the layer editor to the individual channels (where you turn on and off keyframes) there is another button there to activate the graph. Turn that on, and it'll display in the graph view when you open it. Not really intuitive... but yeah. Otherwise just use easy-ease on keyframes. almost nothing should be left linear.  No problem.

The quick action serves to cover up any choppiness. Some bits could be paced a little differently but it's not an instant turn off. The demon looked to be dancing in that one clip of just him.

Is your tablet properly set up, ie do you have it mapped properly to your monitor(s)?  Its a given that using a tablet will take some getting used to, you cannot see your hand/pen/drawing like you can with paper.  Go ahead and get a cintiq if you've got lots of money to burn, they're amazing and will give you the best digital drawing/painting experience possible. Good tools are vitally important when you're animating 8-10 hours a day.  But if you're just getting into drawing and animating digitally and aren't making money from it you're probably better off learning to use a tablet."

I calculated that I work 5 times faster in the cintiq than I used in the bamboo (intuos).  To do the same work, I had to put 5 times more effort in the Bamboo to get to my work done. I had to do a line, try to adjust it, then delete, do it again and re-adjust. Now I draw what I have to. The adjustment of the lines is minimal.  But the price is a thing to have in mind. I had to save a lot to do the jump. But I don't regret it. In fact, If anyday it breaks, please god not, I would save a lot more money to buy another one.  During my summer vacation I was going to carry the bamboo with me... but finally I have decided to carry the Cintiq (yes, the 15 kg Cintiq). And this is how I will spend my summer vacation."

Scene 121 has 2 panels, and you see panel 1 and panel two in that picture. S/A is shorthand for ""same action"" DX -double exposure, for the semi transparent shadow. not sure about db st and bot lit Not sure if it is more common to do the 'inbetween' panels or to do new panels for each action,  seems like they may have been added after the original storyboards, to clarify some actions. Lastly no idea why they would number them this way.    Sorry I couldn't be more help."
animation,3ail0m,madafaku,2,Sat Jun 20 16:03:39 2015 UTC,"Thanks this is definitely more help than I've been able to find in Google.  As a follow-up do you know how ""same action"" works? Or when are you supposed to use it instead of re-drawing something from the previous panel?"
animation,3ail0m,madafaku,1 point,Sat Jun 20 20:59:35 2015 UTC,"I believe that the S/A could be used anytime you have a stationary object in the frame with a moving or changing object.  If everything is stationary, you would only need one panel.  If something in the foreground is still, while characters run through the background, this would be a time saving shortcut.  As far as when to use it... it is probably going to depend on who you are working for.  Like /u/Bighappyaccident said, every studio is going to have a different system of ""what works for them"".  If your doing it for yourself than do whatever makes the most sense to you and the crew you're working with.  If you plan to add the boards to your portfolio I would probably avoid using the S/A shortcut in lieu of making the drawing look as awesome as possible.  If your making the boards for your personal project, I would use it whenever applicable to save time and energy, and move the production forward as quickly and cheaply as possible."

animation,3aghhc,operationsellotape,24,Fri Jun 19 23:23:20 2015 UTC,"Really? Who's down-voting for no reason? Depends what you want to do with animation, but if you're purely interested in employment, After Effects is very useful and versatile to be knowledgeable in. You can do animated motion graphics for commercials, animated characters, adding special effects, and video editing. Flash is good if you want to make cartoons. Or animate silly things. Easy to learn (sort-of) but has a lot of quirks. I  have a tutorial for it here. Toon Boom is best for professional and experienced animators, as the learning curve is pretty steep, but it's an amazing program and what I currently use the most! You can apply special effects, have a 3D camera, and the drawing tools are really nice to use. Hope this helps! PM me if you have any questions! :)"

animation,3aghhc,exit6,3,Sat Jun 20 00:15:49 2015 UTC,"I think at this point you can skip Flash. I would agree though, Toon Boom is the best for your characters etc, and you can pull that footage into after effects for compositing and effects. My advice, learn Toon Boom, Ae and Cinema 4d. If you want to go for a more hand drawn feel and don't need to build rigs for your characters you may want to pick up TV Paint too."
animation,3aghhc,lolredditor,1 point,Sat Jun 20 01:13:32 2015 UTC,"If you do end up building rigs for your characters, you can check out the free Source Film Maker from valve as well.

animation,3aghhc,animatorgeek,4,Sat Jun 20 00:47:24 2015 UTC,"(My background: I've been a professional animator in Hollywood for ten years, working on a number of TV shows, web series, and occasional online interactive ads. I'm currently working on Season 2 of Tom & Jerry for Cartoon Network. Almost all my professional work has been in Flash.)  I'm unsure whether to agree with other commenters about skipping Flash. Honestly, Flash is alive and well in the animation industry. You're not going to be targeting Flash Player in a web browser any more, but there's still lots of animation being done for TV, ads, commercials, and more. The studios I've worked at in the past few years (in the Los Angeles area) have had a really hard time finding enough decent Flash animators to fill the demand.  That said, I don't know if it'll last. My impression from the Adobe developers is that they're finally putting some effort into making Flash a better platform for animation. If they come through on that then I don't really see an end to its use in professional animation. If they don't come through then Flash will eventually be replaced by better programs (Toon Boom Harmony is nipping at its heels currently).  Honestly, unless your traditional animation is to a good enough level, the tool you're using doesn't really matter much. If you're still learning I'd suggest Flash. You can always learn other tools later, and then you won't be stuck simultaneously learning to do animation while struggling to learn the tools."
animation,3aghhc,TheTwigMaster,2,Sat Jun 20 07:56:48 2015 UTC,"I agree with jessejayjones has said. At my current job, I'm using Photoshop and After Effects to do my animation work.   That said, if you are brand new to using animation software and just want to get your feet wet, Flash is how I did my very first animations when I was younger. You can draw right onto the canvas and see your results without worrying about video codecs and lots of rendering. You get acquainted with the idea of using tweening to ease the animation process, as well as dealing with layers and the timeline.   It's likely, if you work in the industry, that you'll do contract/freelance work independently. This means that as long as you hand in quality deliverables, they don't care what software you use. Pick the one you do the best work with!"
animation,3aghhc,parkerharper,1 point,Sat Jun 20 02:46:14 2015 UTC,"I run an animation shop and work with > 20 animators... most of them use AfterEffects, some still use Flash (with great results). Toon Boom (Harmony) is for larger production environments where many people collaborate. (Some draw assets, some do animation). I think Futurama uses Toon Boom Harmony. My Little Pony too?  I agree with above advice, and add the following: a) find a local mentor your can sit next to, and use whatever she / he is using. You'll learn way faster.  b) Once you learn the basics (keyframes, rigging puppets, how to build and organize your assets) you can pretty much apply it to any anim software. Just need to learn the workflow."

DISCLAIMER: I'm a producer, not an illustrator, so I can't give you any drawing tips, but you can see the bits that are always tough... walk cycles, facial expressions... Your art and motion will get better with practice. (Tons of it.) You'll get more efficient and learn what works for your style.     Production tips: -While I loved the music (for the beginning and end), it was too flat during the conflict sequence starting around 2:00. Music should have it's own story arc too and follow the narrative. -Voice talent was good for rough draft or blocking, but the exact same animation would ""feel"" better with a bit more voice acting. Finding the right voiceover artist it always tough, but you'll know it when you hear it.     Keep working, keep animating. Try lots of styles to see what works best. Maybe some 30-second studies or shorts to troubleshoot techniques (rather than a whole animation.) Nice work though. Fun to watch."

animation,3afyjx,tinktinkdotorg,2,Fri Jun 19 20:44:57 2015 UTC,You should be able to use all of those programs to create an animation. I prefer to import images into after effects to make my animations but if you're more comfortable with Photoshop you could even import each of the pictures you've created as layers and create a GIF from those layers.  There are a lot of tutorials on how to do this online. Here's one: https://youtu.be/8-NK1UTHL-U

You're going to have a hard time finding an animator worth their salt to create YOUR idea all for zero remuneration for their time and effort.   It's disrespectful because you don't take into account the time, knowledge and skill it takes to pull off a Pixar quality animation or any animation really. You go further by equating it to live action which takes much less time as a whole.  Then even further with your justification: ""I don't even profit"". Why would anyone work with you if your channel isn't a success?  Think about it: If a person were capable of animating on that level they would do it for a living or create their own ideas. They don't need your channel or your 'exposure' as their own channel or a festival award would get them much more notoriety than yet another Youtube partner.  I don't say this to be rude but what your asking for is free work in one of the most time consuming creative fields."

animation,3ae5y8,Khiv_,2,Fri Jun 19 11:40:32 2015 UTC,Consider looking into Anime Studio. It excels at rigging characters for cut out animation (like Southpark or Monty Python).  There are a ton of official webinars and user tutorials to get you started.  Older versions of the 'professional' tier are often cheaper than the current version of the 'debut' tier. I use v9.5 Pro which I got for 50 bucks on eBay.  Version 11 just came out not too long ago and it supports frame by frame drawing however if you don't need FBF then a copy of v10 or v9 would be enough.  It has a set of vector drawing tools built in but you can also rig raster images you import.

animation,3ae5y8,madafaku,2,Sun Jun 21 18:00:51 2015 UTC,"If you have some experience in video editing, I would say to animated in your editing software, if not I think that anime studio is a great program for people with no experience.  Very easy to learn simple program that's affordable and user friendly with lots of tutorials.  But don't expect to make any ""master pieces"" in AS.  and it is a very limited program, with almost not support for frame by frame animation.  But for doing simple vector based cartoons for education of young children, it seems like a perfect match.  Next up the line in price is flash, which has a much steeper learning curve.  It is much more versatile, and you can make some truly amazing stuff in it.  But it is quite labor intensive compared to AS, and a bit limited, as it is not strictly an animation tool, but more of an internet development tool now.  Toon boom is more of a professional animation program.  And the price tag says as much.  Pretty difficult learning curve. Great program though.  I believe most shows like the Simpsons are using this now.  TV Paint also pretty expensive.  I think some shows on disney are using it now.  It is the only one on this list that is not vector bases, which is a blessing and a curse.  Pretty straitforward program once you jump in.  But not an overwhelming amount of support when you get lost.  It's very focused on traditional hand drawn frame by frame animation, so it is very (probably the most) labor intensive, but with that you can make some fantastic looking stuff.  Basically, if you have a drawing tablet, and are serious about making animation a hobby you put a lot of time into, or even a career at some point, look into some of the other programs.  If you haven't got a tablet, and just want to make some cute cartoons, look into anime studio.  As for tutorials/books,  get the Illusion of Life (Disney), The Animators Handbook (the bible), Cartoon Animation (preston blair) and if you ever want to pitch a show to a network, Creating Cartoons with Character (Joe Murray)  .. do a google search for videos on Animation Basics, Principals of Animation, and more focused searches based on the program you decide on.

Archer works because the dialogue is very well written.  The animation is just enough to carry that.   just about any animation program I can think of could do the movements.  As far as the artwork, you're going to want to use a decent drawing program.  The drawings are made to look very detailed and realistic to human proportions by animation standards, so maybe consider finding stock model pictures you can trace over.    But like I said, if you want to emulate archer, start with the writing.  The art isn't the hard part with that show."

animation,3aat5g,HobbyDaily,2,Thu Jun 18 16:23:26 2015 UTC,"I enjoyed it! :) You've got some great voice talent in there.  The overall animation can be a bit stilted at times -- but if it's any consolation, the decent character design largely distracts me from it. Assuming you're using Flash, just be sure apply some easing (where appropriate) at the head and/or tail of your tweens. Right now there seems to be none, and the result is that the character movements look kinda robotic.  You may want to consider converting all those tweens into keys timed on twos (or ones where appropriate). Among other things, this allows you to quickly make micro-adjustments to your symbols without futzing around with the Custom Ease window as you roll your drawings / check your arcs. Also makes it look less 'Flash-ey', IMO. You can either do this manually, or use this plugin to get you started: http://ajarproductions.com/blog/2010/12/05/flash-extension-convert-to-2s/  On a related note -- the lip-sync could be tightened up a lot. I feel this is the weakest part of the short. While your overall timing is mostly on point, (could use some nudging here and there) there are some mouth shape choices that just aren't working. Creating some additional opened/closed mouth shapes (instead of leaning heavily on the tweens) should improve the delivery greatly. On that note, don't go overboard with drawing out every single syllable. Phrase out your dialogue. Some helpful info here: http://minyos.its.rmit.edu.au/aim/a_notes/anim_lipsync.html As I've mentioned, you've got a great, enthusiastic VO to play with... so don't skimp! :)  One final thing, unrelated to the animation -- you should take the time in your final mix to adjust your audio levels (i.e., volumes for dialogue, music, sfx, etc.) for the whole short. (Or find an audio engineer who can help you.) In particular, the levels difference between the two main characters is very noticeable.  Other than that, nice work! :D If you aren't using Flash, all these notes are still applicable to other software such as TB Harmony and Anime Studio Pro. Reach out if you have additional questions. And good luck! :)  **NINJA EDIT: Noticed you are using Harmony! Same stuff applies, just dive into your ""Set Ease for Multiple Parameters"" panel instead of Flash's ""Custom Ease"" window.

Real life movement usually just doesn't cut it (in 2d animation at least)  Tracing each and every frame, or every other frame as it was done here, is extremely consistent. It lacks the knowledge of an animator using the ""snap"" of suddenly switching from drawing every other frame, to every frame to bring speed, and it feels lifelessly slow."

animation,39zpa3,whatevsIDGAF,2,Tue Jun 16 02:24:56 2015 UTC,"Dun dun dun... Well we use Toon Boom, for animation, storyboard, and the whole pipe line, it's the best. BUT... it has a huge learning curve. Adobe Flash is the most popular software for web animation but it too has a huge learning curve. If you haven't animated before, jumping into a web series might be a step. It takes us about 4 weeks to make just a few minutes of quality animation. If you can slog through Flash tutorials (available on youtube), you can make 'flapping head' animation pretty easy. Flapping head animation is pretty much people's mouths opening and closing with no action and you CAN make a web series this way. If you want to know more about animation, it's best to start from the beginning. You can't build a skyscraper if you can't build a tree fort first. Abobe Flash and Toon Boom both now run on an monthly subscription and it pretty inexpensive. ($10-$25 buck a month vs thousands of dollars for a liscence if you bought it a few years ago)  I hope this helps and please post whatever you animate!"

They seem to form new layers and remove layers of wrapping even in the short time the clip is. Try keep in mind what's supposed to be there and manipulate it, rather than adding and removing volumes. In terms of timing, I think you could have hit the beat of the cough with the extremes a little better. That might just be a matter of pushing a frame forward or back. If you're looking for software to try, I personally would recommend TVPaint. Seems like it would suit that hand-drawn look you're going for, and it's relatively cheap. Good luck with any future animating :D"

Overall the lighting looks pretty good seems to be a little too warm though. Add some DOF to the shot. I would throw a subtle light wrap on your character.  Similar to your last shot, do not just focus on color correcting the character you are adding, but work on the plate as well. Once you have both layers to a place that looks pretty good, ad an adjustment layer and do some color tweaks to the entire shot."

animation,39uabq,soundofarthr,2,Sun Jun 14 20:56:34 2015 UTC,"Looking pretty good, definitely a few things to improve! Adding to /u/sirrandalot's comment:  Compare the shadows your character makes on the ground to the ones you made in the 'before' shot. The shadows you cast are visibly sharper.   The character's lighter elements feel too bright still. Additionally compare the shadows on your face to those on your character - there are highlights on the right side of your face but instead the right side of the character is actually the most in shadow.  Finally adding a very faint blur of some sort will integrate him into the scene further and remove that crisp CG feel. Hope these helped!"

Cheers"
animation,39uabq,sirrandalot,1 point,Mon Jun 15 07:50:49 2015 UTC,"It's pretty good, the lighting on the character matches pretty well. There are two things that I see as being a little off thought.    The perspective on the character seems strange, almost as if the camera angle or focal length didn't match the original one in the scene footage. It could just be the character's position though.    The shadow on the floor doesn't look very realistic, so the character appears to be floating. Take a look at your reference footage and you'll see that the closer the object casting a shadow is to the ground, the sharper the shadow is. So the shadow should be sharper near the feet and fuzzier farther away.    Good job otherwise! Hope that helped :)"

animation,39uabq,warriortah,1 point,Sun Jun 14 22:05:47 2015 UTC,"The shadow needs to be sharpest the closer it is to the feet/body, and the darkest.  Look at your own shadow for reference. This is very important, and the biggest issue in your scene  also the character looks 'sharper' than the rest of the scene: the background is slightly blurry, and the character is crisper. This makes him look like he's pasted in.   the light source is behind the character, so he should be backlit; not completely, but more so than he is at the moment e.g. slight shadow in middle of the face/neck - again look at your reference pictures.  And the lightest parts of the character should be darker than the lightest parts of the background; overall make him darker.  This could also help him stand out from the background, as his face is getting very lost because it doesn't have any differentiation from the bg.  good work :) keep going!"

The source of light definitely needs to be from behind a little more, I attempted this but the light pass in AE was all or nothing from that position. Ie the puppet was either in complete darkness from the front or not. I'm sure it's just user error with the light pass ha! Thanks again"

animation,39rcb3,PartPoet,31,Sun Jun 14 00:21:35 2015 UTC,"Keep going! Keep working, keep playing, keep coming up with silly ideas and fleshing them out in interesting ways. Don't limit yourself to Legos. Try to make drawn flip books, comics, illustrations, anything you can think of to get your ideas on paper, recorded,  or published in any way. Get your stuff out there and keep making more.  You've got a knack for punchlines and silly concepts and that's great. I think you need to keep a sketchbook if you don't already. Draw everything that comes to mind. Write down ideas, make mind-maps, do silly doodles, and make funny faces at yourself in the mirror. Draw your notes in class instead of writing them. Understand the world around you with your art. Do anything to workout that creative and goofy mind of yours. The more you do now, the more you can do later.  I'm a professional graphic designer and illustrator and I often have to make motion graphics (animations, cartoons and other moving media). I started when I was young making goofy characters out of Play-Doh and drawing pictures of butterflies and spaceships. Now I'm an industry professional and get paid to come up with entertaining and interesting ideas every day. Yesterday I created a dozen cute illustrations of polar bears for a client who is having a baby soon and wants to decorate her nursery. When I was 11, I had no idea I'd be where I am, but I kept working and ended up right here. Keep it up and you'll be where you want to be before you know it. Some days will be hard and you'll want to give up. When those days come, just remind yourself about the kinds of things that make you happy. Those are the things you should follow. I love drawing goofy pictures and now I do it for a living.  As far as critique goes, pay special attention to everything that moves around you. Momentum, inertia, pauses, breaks, beats, and anything else that lends itself to realistic motion. Even Legos can move realistically if you spend enough time studying real world motion (just watch the Lego Movie!) Those details are what you need to invest yourself in. I noticed that some of the movements in your videos seemed rushed and jerky. Be patient and do it right. Take your time. This is your craft so be proud and work long and hard at it.  Voice acting skills come with time, keep working and you'll be good. Your voice will grow and change over time and you'll be just fine.  Continue training your eye for detail. The things that people usually overlook are the things that usually make for an effective work of art. Those are the things that should be your bread and butter if you want to do this sort of thing for a living. For example, I loved how you made the plunger in one of your videos, as well as the funny movements of the plumber trying to fix everything. And the different designs of the homes that Sherlock Holmes was trying to sell were amazing! Also, Homes and Holmes is a golden pun. I love it!  If I were you, I'd watch ""Betty Boop"" cartoons on YouTube, old Disney movies like ""Bambi"" and ""Snow White"", and ""Tom and Jerry"". I'd also study some newer things like ""Over the Garden Wall"", ""Adventure Time"", and start watching anime. Anime is corny and sometimes annoying, but those animators really know their stuff. ""My Neighbors the Yamadas"", ""Akira"", and ""Astroboy"" will do you a lot of good if you pay special attention to movement and timing.  We're all proud of you. Keep going and keep creating. If you get bored, pursue the things that spark your interest and you'll find joy. And keep posting here! We love to see this sort of stuff! It's good for everybody to see what everyone else is working on."

The examples are hand-drawn, but the principles apply to all mediums of animation. You could also try learning Blender which is free. When I started learning 3D (at 25) it gave me the same excited feeling of playing with legos as a kid. 3D animation is the building blocks of future entertainment. You'll be a master by the time you're 20 if you start now and be up to date with all the new exciting tech. And keep creating orginal content and posting it.

animation,39rcb3,Hoploo,2,Sun Jun 14 16:19:57 2015 UTC,"OK kid, are you ready for some SCHOOLING?  For your Lego stop motion, check out this BTS (behind-the-scenes) look at how a pro does it: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKQoyA7gE2o There are other BTS videos of his as well.  Some things he doesn't mention: lighting!  You want to make sure you have good lighting for your lego scenes. In general, you're going to want DIFFUSED light. Know what that means? It means you don't have a bare bulb shining directly onto the scene. It means your light is soft and spread out. More info: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADemOgLu_IA  But you don't need professional lights and real sheets of diffusion to do this, you can use just about anything - like a light shining into an old milk jug: http://lifehacker.com/5896796/make-an-ambient-lamp-out-of-a-milk-jug  Now, let's talk camera settings. Let me guess, you've got your camera set to automatic settings on... pretty much everything, right? Yeah, I can tell.  It doesn't really matter what kind of camera you use, as long as you can manually control the most important settings, and you know how to USE IT!  Most important settings to learn about and control:   Focus (super important, for obvious reasons!) zoom iris (also known as aperture. Measured in F-stops.) This is how much light the camera lets through. also, the wider the iris, the more blurry things will be when they are out of focus.   Not as important for you right now:   White balance (How yellow or blue the scene looks. Most auto white balance is pretty good these days, so don't worry too much about this one.) ISO (adjusts the sensitivity of the sensor - this makes the image brighter, but adds ugly digital ""noise."") Probably some other ones I am forgetting.   The upshot of all this is that if you have your camera set to AUTOMATIC IRIS and/or AUTOMATIC ISO, every time you take a photo, it will adjust the brightness of the image to what it thinks is best. But it'll be different every time your picture changes. AND THAT IS WHY your videos flicker to be brighter and darker! Watch your videos frame by frame - you will notice that the picture gets brighter or darker between frames.  Look at this one. http://i1094.photobucket.com/albums/i458/Caroline_Harrius/mssan.gif Do you see how the brightness of the image changes a bit between frames? That's no good!  HOW DO I FIX IT? You ask!  Well, it's easy. Just set your camera to an aperture setting that looks good, and then LEAVE IT THERE for the whole scene. No more shifting brightness! BUT ALSO you have to be careful that nothing else is changing how much light gets onto the subject - your body, for example, might be blocking the light in some shots, but not others. Then the brightness of the scene will be different for each picture. No good! Make sure you are not in the way of any lights, and keep your body in the same place every time you take a shot!  Ok, so I just explained a few out of the hundreds of things you'll need to know. Ultimately, practice makes perfect. Keep making films, keep learning and reading about how its done, and you'll be making great things before you know it.  Oh, and if you want to get better at drawing, this book is highly recommended: http://www.amazon.ca/The-Drawing-Right-Side-Brain/dp/0874774241"

How was this shot set up? How were these effects achieved?  In time you will be able to visually take these shows apart and analyze their pieces.  Is the voice acting all you as well? Your microphone quality is actually pretty good. More silly voices, especially more variation, will help with this skill in the future. Training your vocal chords is like any other muscle, the more you try to make your voice low or high the more you will be able to make your voice lower or higher. There are many voices in several animated shows that are all done by the same person. Mark Hamill is a great example. Check out the documentary ""I Know That Voice."" It's all about voice actors in video games and animation.  Above all else, don't stop. I remember starting out when I was around your age. I also remember being unable to animate for a long time because I was homeless. But I was only homeless for a year, and I've had my own computer now for several years. Do I animate like I used to? No. I make excuses for myself. But I'm trying. Don't stop. Don't ever stop. No matter what people say, or whatever happens to you, don't ever stop doing what you love."
animation,39t2hg,sliplocke,3,Sun Jun 14 14:29:11 2015 UTC,"A combination of programs would probably be your best bet, the entire adobe package would help here, using programs such as photoshop and flash to animate, while putting together the recorded footage and animations in after effects and adobe premiere (this is also where you would want to add effects like shadows etc. to make the illusion a little more convincing). As for Who Framed Roger Rabbit, that movie was painstakingly animated by very talented people, every clever angle and lighting trick was all done by hand on the characters and a lot of scale to character props were used in scenes where the animated characters interact with the real environment (knocking over glasses, things like that). A lot of the work is going to have to come from your own problem solving ability, there's no magic ""Do this technique for me"" button in these software packages.

What I mean by this is that you could make the planes much faster but thats your choice in the end.   Also a trick to make the tanks better is to add a small jolt to them as if they are hitting a bumb in the road. The turrets of the tanks can jolt as well but at like half a second dellay.  These simple things are not super noticeable but really add to everything as  a whole.

My reasoning for the lack of y-trans was that I wanted to experiment with getting away from the the large Y movements we're use to seeing in bipedal mammals.   I found an amazing study where some folk strapped a weighted tail to a chicken to see how it changes its gait. Tuns out that their motion becomes a lot more hip driven and alot of their Y translations gets lost in the side to side. So they have much bigger weight shifts. Ill see if i can find the study, super fascinating stuff. I'm hoping to do a fully body study to really toy with this idea when i have more than an an hour to work on it.

animation,39mjy3,Jack_Crum,6,Fri Jun 12 20:11:27 2015 UTC,"This critique came out a bit lengthy, and probably isn't as harsh as it might sound.  You've got some good ideas here.  I think the stark crispness of the shape and color of the effect separate it a bit from the world it's in.  It feels drawn-in, and not like something that exists in the same space as the 3d stuff.  I think some color tweaks, and some softening through blur or glow on the effect would help.  Animation-wise (not sure if you're wanting a critique on that part or not), watch the motion on the hips, and also the mid-spine.  The keys are very visible on those parts and could use some smoothing out.  The way the hips do pretty much a full stop before the big arm motion is kind of odd.  The torso also sort of snaps into place at the end of the arm movement, and makes the arm movement lose its weight.  Also, the torso looks like some of the keys are hitting at the same time as the arm.  a bit of offset will give it a better feel.  If you're going for a very snappy animation style, I'd recommend faster motions in general with some really quick but noticeable antics and overshooting.  Going straight into a hold looks clunky.  hat you've got going on with the arm is nice, although I might like to see it moving a bit faster on the swoop.  That might also be why the 2d effect feels a bit separate, because the motion isn't going quite fast enough to seem like it requires a big swooshy effect like that.  Also, the leg/hip joint pops a bit at the start."
animation,39mjy3,Bujjick,2,Sat Jun 13 01:02:27 2015 UTC,"That critique was not harsh at all! And I agree with you on all points. The tricky thing is, I'm trying to figure out a way to crank out animations that are less than 2 minutes long in 6 months or less.   I'm trying to create a series of internet-fables, mostly to practice storytelling, not so much beautiful animation. To really animate 2 quality minutes worth of material would take me way longer than 6 months, and that's not even including the initial scripting, story boards, asset creation, rendering and post production.   https://youtu.be/9KM5Lx0K4kc  Here was my first attempt. It took me 9 months to make this while I was working at a full time job.   https://youtu.be/kU6IdFDtaUA  This second attempt only took a month and a half but it was much more minimal.   What I need is some way to rapidly animate stuff that won't look bad. Kind of like Hannah Barbara I guess (not the most noble of animation companies to aspire to be like I guess).  https://youtu.be/JHOZNRhKBrI?list=PLeZV2UXOouwk2nWKbMsaSm-69ZURUTAql  I watch a lot of SFM animations and this guy is able to crank out these shorts in about 3 weeks. The key thing he seems to do is work with minimal poses and leaves a lot of long holds for comedic timing. Kind of like anime.  So- yeah, this animation has a lot of flaws. It's because I'm trying to make them as fast as I can, though I know I can make them better looking and still make them fast, I just need to find the right method for doing this..."
animation,39mjy3,voxeldata,1 point,Sat Jun 13 02:08:17 2015 UTC,"Minimalism is a bit harder to do in 3d. You can get away with a lot less animation/production quality when working in 2d (the RoosterTeeth Animated Adventures come to mind) but not so much in 3d.  If you want to crank out 2 minute animations in a few months, I'd suggest getting good at Flash rather than a 3d program. Since you said you want to focus on storytelling, that might be a better way to work."

It's a lot of problem solving which I find to be pretty fun- also the more you learn the crazier the stuff you can do. For instance, I'm looking into a crowd simulator for this short.

People will get to know you, know that you can be relied on, are not a primadonna or a flake or a poser, and will be among the first to be considered when jobs open up.  You'll get to be a well-known face, and that's where your real career can start.  If you're an animator wannabe, without any skills yet, then just working as a PA won't give you those skills, so don't make that assumption.

In the 7 years I spent animating disney I never saw a PA make that jump... But plenty of PA's move up the production ranks.   I do believe that one PA made the jump to story through the internal training program (which is an amazing program) but only disney and pixar have that as far as I know."
animation,39jgbp,littledigits,2,Sat Jun 13 02:18:16 2015 UTC,"Yes. Almost every sensible company will favour hiring internally over going through the full process.  However, the onus will be on you to stay on people's radar and build relationships with people/departments want to work with. If you just keep to yourself and quietly get on with your entry level work then yeah fuck it, you may as well not be there. This is true at any time you want to explore something a little different to what you're already doing."
animation,39jgbp,littledigits,2,Fri Jun 12 11:51:10 2015 UTC,if you have animation skills then I dont see why not. But animation takes a lot of work. Working in a studio you learn tons about the process but unless you have the schooling for animation or the skills it would be tough to get into that job.

I've had a few contracts here and there, but where I was living at the time (Austin, Tx), had only one semi-major 2D studio mainly used for outsourcing.  Now 5 years later, I'm definitely not up to snuff on my animation and would most likely be passed over, but working in a smaller capacity at a studio, being surrounded by artists would keep me creative and able to get back into it.  Or at least I would hope."

But with that being said theres no harm in applying for whatever position is availble , might as well get them used to your face while you work on your demo reel.

It's just that right now I imagine it would take me half a year for a finished 30 second clip of a single character with a rough background.

Next time have the weight do a nice looooong ease in as he's lifting it up.  Inertia is the best way to show something has weight- ""an object at rest tends to stay at rest"". Think of a car accelerating: the heavier the car is the longer it takes to get up to 60MPH. So while you do a great job animating your character straining to pick up the weight and even a pretty great job of it falling down, the speed with which he gets the weight off the ground actually makes it look fairly light. Like a monster truck going from 0 to 60 in just a couple of frames."

I believe he unwraps it there and paints it in Photoshop CC.  He then sends me the model and I rig and skin it in 3DS Max.  I export it to FBX and open the FBX with Autodesk Motionbuilder. I give it a control rig and animate it using their fancy control rig. I highly recommend obtaining a copy to learn it. It seems like a lot of pros use it and it's very clear why. It's super powerful.  From there it goes in to Unity.

You just make your normal bones and make sure you have the bare minimum required by Motionbuilder and then assign those bones to a character definition panel such as assigning all of your spine bones to the control rig's spine definition.  Then you turn on the control rig, choose biped IK/FK, and bam. Control rig. You can pin any joint at anytime. Any joint can becomean IK target at any time. It's crazy.

I think the two biggest improvements would be: add rotation/tilt to the hips and make his hands/arms pop out faster and he pulls them away from his chest.  Specifically as he pulls his arms away from the chest that's the part that seems slow.  They seem to accelerate to a nice clip at the end and I think you could ease into their final position rather having them hit that key hard and then come back forward to adjust.

All the programs I mentioned above are free and should be a good way to test the waters without being out a wad of cash.

animation,39aoo6,smileymaster,7,Wed Jun 10 13:42:51 2015 UTC,"Smooth out the hesitation when the right foot is going forward. left foot's flow is fine, you probably just need to cut a couple frames when the right foot is going forward."
animation,39aoo6,SeanaldYaygan,2,Wed Jun 10 16:30:48 2015 UTC,"No cut on the right side. The right side already has less frames, so either cut the left side or add to the right side, depending on what kind of speed you want. Just make it symmetrical.   With Doubled frames on the right side the rhythm seems fine  I commented in depth about what seems to be wrong down below somewhere."
animation,39aoo6,JanusChan,1 point,Thu Jun 11 09:07:57 2015 UTC,"No now you added awkward hesitation to both sides it looks like. The right side was moving slower while also looking less smooth than the left. There's probably more double frames there, it almost looks like they're going 12 frames a second, but the right side was accidentally like 14 frames a second or something."
animation,39aoo6,SeanaldYaygan,1 point,Thu Jun 11 12:05:35 2015 UTC,"Of course there is gonna be an awkward hesitation when two frames are double. It's going to skip, but it's meant as a general overview of the flow, which is also why it's slowed down a bit so you can see what happens better. Two double frames on the right side, nothing edited on the left side like you seem to observe? Not a fix obviously, but an example. Like I said, there's more explanation down below.  Go through the original frame by frame if you want to. There is no extra framerate on just one side. The step has more frames on the left side and the legswing has more frames on the right side, which makes it off. There are also a couple of rough differences in poses of course, but since this is a beginner animation I am sure they will be roughed out eventually once there's a a good understanding of the symmetry in frames of a run or walkcycle."
animation,39aoo6,JanusChan,10,Thu Jun 11 13:11:28 2015 UTC,"It's hard to see when it's such a short clip and it doesn't loop properly. Should try to loop it better.

animation,39aoo6,MollyRocket,3,Sat Jun 13 17:06:56 2015 UTC,"This is your first try? NICE! There are just a couple of things that I noticed:  First, it doesn't loop. It's not a cycle if it doesn't loop. Make sure that your first frame and your last frame are the same pose, that way you'll be able to make it look more easily, and then when you export it just make sure the last pose isn't there so it doesn't look like its popping.  But because of this it looks like Finn is stumbling, but also like he's speeding up into his next step. This is also resulting in Finn doing a little headshake between steps when he should be moving his head smoothly from side to side.  It looks like your in-air position is being held for too long. On the front 3/4 front you can see his screen left leg pop out to the side before going into its higher position before impact.  The frames are almost there, but your timing needs some work. Keep it up~<3"

animation,39aoo6,Mistaken_Stranger,1 point,Wed Jun 10 18:19:21 2015 UTC,It's a pretty good cycle. I think you have him in the air a little to long which makes it seem a little wonkey. That and like /u/Nobellet said it doesn't loop properly. That said for a first attempt this is really well done.
animation,39aoo6,kyzfrintin,1 point,Wed Jun 10 14:18:01 2015 UTC,"All I can say is try to make each step take roughly the same amount of time. After he's jumped from his left foot, he hangs in the air a little longer while the right foot comes down, which makes it seem like he's limping or just glitching. Other than that, nice animation."

animation,39aoo6,Bighappyaccident,3,Wed Jun 10 15:22:50 2015 UTC,i think part of the problems youre having with this is that its not rigged up in a way that makes it easy for you. The head needs to not have its rotations influenced by the body. You can see it all jerking about with the torso rotations. look up world space vs body space vs local space and see how to set it up accordingly.
animation,39aoo6,fpfranco,2,Wed Jun 10 16:11:25 2015 UTC,Wow with no rig you did a decent job!  Get some IK feet in there at least!

animation,39aoo6,JanusChan,1 point,Thu Jun 11 02:25:52 2015 UTC,And make sure your last pose matches the first!!
animation,39aoo6,Howaya,1 point,Thu Jun 11 02:26:35 2015 UTC,"The problem seems to be in the amount of frames that you use when Finn brings his legs forward. The left leg uses four frames from a frontal position to touching the ground and then proceeds to move backwards. The right leg has only two frames between a frontal position and touching the ground and already moves backwards in the third frame. This is what stops it from being a loop, his right side and left side don't move in the same rhythm, making it look like a stumble.  I tried to see what would happen if I doubled those two frames on his right side and your walk looks a lot more smooth that way already.   Look here, (slowed down a bit too just to make it more clear) seems as if you've done a great job! Especially for a first time. It's just missing some frames. Keep both sides on the same frame count and you should be fine.  Edit: You might even want to make it three frames or two frames for both sides. That way you can play with the rhythm and see which one looks more like running. The cycle with four may be a little bit too slow for your liking. Play around with it.  IMPORTANT second edit: It seems the gif didn't save properly and I was looking at a version where two frames on the right side were lost. My advice about the frame distribution is the same, yet it seems your frame distribution is also different in the transitioning leg swing on both sides. Besides the difference between the four 'step'-frames on the left and the two 'step'-frames on the right side there's also a problem with other frames. You use 2 'swing'-frames on the left side, while you use four 'swing'-frames on the right. Adjust the amount 'swing'-frames in the same way I suggested you do with the 'step'-frames and that should help. Sorry for the major edits."

animation,39dqlb,MrsRadon,1 point,Thu Jun 11 04:20:26 2015 UTC,"This is a great little exercise! Good start. My first instinct is, based on the speed of the drop and the slope of the ramp it's path would continue pretty consistently off the ramp and hit the side of the glass first. Then some kind of splashy bounce off the edge.   If you think that's too much for you right now, I would either slow down the drop, and/or lessen the slope.  It would also be cool if the drop hits the bottom of the glass, slides to the corner, and splashes slightly upward along the edge of the glass before settling in the corner. Think about the forward momentum, nothing just comes to a complete stop, the left over energy needs to be absorbed or expressed in some way. (Example of over-exaggeration: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HEZXCJS0Aro. The coyote is absorbed into the wall (a squash) and then is pushed backward because all of his energy needed to go somewhere, and it couldn't go forward) This is essentially Newton's 3rd Law of Motion: every action has an equal and opposite reaction. Based on your trajectory- down and left- the equal and opposite reaction would be up and right, creating a nice rounded arc for your little drop!  Great start! Keep at it and let us see an updated version when you get to it!"

animation,39d0q3,glimpee,1 point,Wed Jun 10 23:03:51 2015 UTC,I would imagine they are done in post via compositing. The highlight layers are rendered out separately and placed over the animation with a glow/blur effect and some sort of blending mode like add.   You could achieve this in After Effects.
animation,39d0q3,-Abnormal-,1 point,Thu Jun 11 16:20:09 2015 UTC,"ahhh I thought it would be something like that  So in the case of Toonboom, I would make a drawing without the highlights, and then would I add the highlight in aftereffects or draw it in toonboom/export to AF/edit/reimport  actually probably doesnt really matter either way, thanks!  -also do you know any good places to start? I havent used AF yet and feel like Ill make it look shitty"
animation,39d0q3,-Abnormal-,1 point,Thu Jun 11 21:25:04 2015 UTC,I'd draw the highlights in toonboom because after effects isn't great for that kind of thing. Just make sure you do them on a different layer than the fill and lines so you can separate them later with an alpha channel. Then bring the video layers into after effects and play with the glow or blur effects and blending modes until you get a look you like. There should be some tutorials on YouTube that can walk you through the AE process.

animation,39d0q3,-Abnormal-,1 point,Fri Jun 12 00:34:49 2015 UTC,"I'm not really proficient in Toonboom. I use flash mostly. Here's an example of my shading process in flash  I draw the lines then the base fill. The colour differences in the lines tell me what kind of shading it needs. For me red is fill and green is highlight but you can use any colour. In flash I use the line tool to make the highlights, fill in the area with the paint bucket then delete the lines.   Hope that helps :)"

animation,398cay,superdrunk1,2,Wed Jun 10 00:01:33 2015 UTC,"I've done a lot of freelancing like this--acceptable rates typically fall between $15 and $40 per hour. For a flat rate, between $500 and $1500 per minute of animation. Ask for what you think you can get, and what won't make you feel like you're taking advantage or being taken advantage of. You get a feel for this eventually.    Someone else commented that you need to charge enough that you won't be stressed, frustrated, and annoyed while working on the project. This is really important if you want to sustain this sort of work without burning out. If you can afford to wait for the higher paying work, then wait (that is--getting less work, because you ask for higher rates). There's no hard and fast rule to determine the numbers--you just have to figure out what rates at which you can work happily, and that comes from figuring out what rates make you unhappy (experience)."
animation,398cay,EreTheWorldCrumbles,1 point,Wed Jun 10 07:10:35 2015 UTC,"As far as I know, a good first time rate is something like about $0.75-$2 per frame.

animation,398cay,njtrafficsignshopper,1 point,Wed Jun 10 04:37:51 2015 UTC,"First of all -- add up your overhead. You spent 40 hours on that last project -- what if this was your living. How much would you need to charge? Consider your rent/mortgage, insurance, car payment, software and computer costs, bills, etc. You need to make a certain amount of money beyond that also so that you can save and have some degree of disposable income. I can't stress the saving part enough, because whether you work in a studio or freelance -- the day is going to come when you don't have work for a while, and you're going to need savings to live on."
animation,398cay,Voodoo_Masta,0,Wed Jun 10 10:52:22 2015 UTC,"I'll preface this with the fact that I'm not a professional animator, i just do minor freelance jobs occasionally.  It kind of depends on how much of a friends rate you want to give them.   If you want to be generous just charge minimum wage, but realistically you could easily charge 15-40+ bucks an hour depending on where you live and what competitors are charging. After a year or two of doing this kind of work with a strong reel you could probably charge 40-60."

Because the cape is a secondary action, it cannot function without the movement of the girl. The problem right now is that it swoops to the left side before she really moves left. The only reason the cape would swoop is because she rushes right and it drags behind. So that part needs delayed, otherwise it breaks the motion.   The other major change to make is the ending. It's hard for me to give details because it goes by so quick and I can't flip it frame by frame, but the final settle into the pose is so abrupt that it is jarring. She needs more time (frames) to get to that last pose. You can certainly keep the blur frame in the middle, but it just needs led into and out of a little smoother. Again, I could give more details if you have a Quicktime version I could flip through one frame at a time, it's just not possible to see with it moving so fast. :) Hope that helps some, keep going!"

animation,392xay,MercuryCV,1 point,Mon Jun 8 21:36:05 2015 UTC,They don't respond because it is an expensive project.... the way Blur Studios did the Blizzard video at least.  I think we could come up with a more creative / cheaper solution.  Do you already own the 2d artwork or 3d models of the characters on your labels?  Something similar could be done in After Effects without some of the 3d rotation.    Let's take a look.  Contact me though my website: 3d animation by Studio2a
animation,392xay,adamkru,1 point,Mon Jun 8 21:54:53 2015 UTC,"Yup we own the illustrations we have. We work with one of the illustrators from the God of War games.  Thanks for the info, I'll follow up soon"
animation,392xay,RachelRayManis,1 point,Mon Jun 8 22:49:17 2015 UTC,"That will help a lot and is VERY important to mention when doing a quote, I imagine without that info most studios would be adding the illustration into the production cost, which is a big chunk of it due to all the detail.   I think once you got your storyboard down you could get away with either an after effects animator or 3d animator projecting the illustrations onto image planes. I understand the basics of doing all of this, though I'm currently involved in a few other projects right now and if you have a tight timeline that could cause problems. Well that and I don't consider myself blizzard level so I calculate my costs at $25 an hour as opposed to the $50 hr most top teir animators charge.   Anyway, I'm not a studio but if you want to do image projection stuff and already have the images and it's something short (most commercials are about 30 seconds) I might be able to do it or at least get you started with a storyboard. If sketches work fine I can probably do a 30 second storyboard in 5 hours (it's not just drawing, it's figuring things out, like timing and virtual camera placement) which would be $125.   I've seen image projection like this on planes before, though none of my past projects have needed this. I will wager a guess that modeling the plane to accurately project the image will probably take around 3 hours per image/model that needs to move in 3d space (If that is grossly off and is more work than expected I'd have to re-calculate that, but based on what I know that's my guess.) So that's $75 per model (this is not a full model, just a front plane in the shape of the image with very limited rotation. Full models would cost a great deal more.) you need done to make it faux 3D. If the art just moves across the screen and no 3D effects are needed that's far easier and faster, that'd just require importing them into after effects. Then you'd need any additional artwork such as titles done, storyboards are usually done first because they let everyone on the project know exactly what you need, and what goes where- it's hard to get a concrete number without that, but the guesses above are around where I'd start, and then get more concrete numbers with a storyboard.  Do you have voice over/ music already? Those can be found easily enough but I don't do that so you'd find out that cost from the people making those for you.  My site is www.TaintedEnterprises.com if you want to see my past work and my email is RachelRayManis @ Gmail.com if you want to talk more about your project"
animation,392xay,RachelRayManis,1 point,Mon Jun 8 23:42:12 2015 UTC,"For the kind of video you want to make that's a LOT of unique drawings and 3D models. Low end will be several thousands of dollars, it's a LOT of work and high detail pieces there. If you wanted something simpler and more in the range of flash animation it'd cost less, but yeah the example video would have an astronomical work load and price."

When it gets to be almost impossible to come up with something, I try simplify as much as I can. A character is trying to get something, but there's something in their way, how do they overcome it?   A mailman is trying to deliver a package, but the owner is gone and their angry dog is dangerous, how does he deliver the package? Just as clear a situation as you can get (mailmen deliver mail, dogs hate them), then from there, finding a unique twist or way of telling that tale. Does he overcome the issue? Does he fail? A setup (mailman w/ package), a conflict (oh shit a dog), then a resolution (however your unique storytelling voice guides you).  You may think your life is boring, but once you understand how to find your ideas, you'll be able to form them from even the tiniest of occurrences all around you.

animation,38ycgk,TheSlackerKing,1 point,Tue Jun 9 02:12:30 2015 UTC,"It's great to see someone that wants to avoid parodies. I love watching independent animation but I could go the rest of my life without watching yet another video game parody.   It's hard to give advice on this topic because the solution is intangible and subjective to every individual.  To start with I'd look at a list of story types (man vs nature, man vs machine, etc) with that in mind look at a list of comedy/drama tropes depending on what genre you're going for. From there maybe see if any of them fit into a narrative you want to tell and twist them to your own POV.  After a while though you need to ask yourself if all the study is a form of procrastination. A book recommendation could be the north star that guides you or it could be another way to ask yourself for permission and sit idle thinking ""I'm not ready"".   Hard to say what is the best route to take since there's no one right way but there's definitely a wrong way.   I want to add that there is nothing wrong with myths. You'll find mythology used in a lot of cartoons to make writing easier. The Simpsons bible episode comes to mind. Wasn't a particularly good episode (in my opinion) but they adapted bible stories to their characters and it was far more entertaining than the actual texts. Star Wars is another good example of hijacking mythology.  For me, I have tons of ideas, but I'm lazy. Though I'm not entirely lazy and I end up studying styles, techniques, new software when I should be doing styles and techniques in software I'm already familiar with.   I believe that through doing it's the only way we can really learn new skills and push ourselves to new plateaus.  Ideas come easy but good ideas are much harder to find.   You seem like you know what you want to do but maybe haven't found your voice yet. You say your life is boring and most lives are, especially for animators. That being said we all have interesting experiences to tell and surely there must be experiences that can be embellished and reworked to a character who is maybe different than you. Maybe they'd respond differently?"

How do the shaders react to camera movement? Would your GI hold up if you had camera movement? Let alone character animation.
animation,38xtk7,Spicy-Salsa,1 point,Sun Jun 7 20:46:31 2015 UTC,"You're absolutely right, I guess if I make sure the GI is consistent/follows the natural lighting of the scene it'll pass as a valid composite?"
animation,38xtk7,Spicy-Salsa,1 point,Mon Jun 8 05:42:19 2015 UTC,"Well. There's a lot more to GI than just the consistency. Totally depends on the renderer and GI method. Certain methods don't hold up with any sort of physical animation (camera, character etc) While others do. Questions you need to ask are, does my ""test"" reflect the conditions my final render/composite are going to be going through? If not, it might be a good idea to go through and make sure you're rendering it in a way that will give you the freedom to tweak to your heart's content when you comp it."
animation,38xtk7,Spicy-Salsa,1 point,Mon Jun 8 08:14:08 2015 UTC,"Ok brilliant, I guess at the moment I'm trying to capture the character in the most neutral/flat way possible with the thought of having increased flexibility in post. Is that the kinda idea you're referring to?"
animation,38xtk7,Spicy-Salsa,1 point,Mon Jun 8 11:25:51 2015 UTC,"Sure. By all means. But will it look ""neutral/flat"" when you have to switch to a completely different render method that facilitates animation or equivalent?  I think it's important to think about what you want to produce, and find out what you need to get you there. Obviously I have no idea what renderer you're using. You could be using V-Ray with brute force GI going, which is often gonna give you good results with animation. But yeah. I would be a shame if you got to the end of your ""comp"" work, and realized you had to redo your entire lighting/GI set up and subsequently comp. Good to check these things! :)"
animation,38xtk7,Spicy-Salsa,1 point,Mon Jun 8 11:44:39 2015 UTC,"I see, well I'm using after effects for both the keying of the puppet & the GI of the scene at present. I've yet to use programs like the ones you've mentioned as I need money to eat, although I've looked at them in the past. Yea you're totally right, especially with it being such an involved/time sacrificing process as it is :) I guess as long as the lighting of the puppet is as close as possible to the scene I'm compositing into I'll get there somehow with the lighting/shadows. Have you had any experience with setting up GI in after effects/had any success with it? Thanks again for your suggestions/patience :)"
animation,38xtk7,Scavenger144,1 point,Tue Jun 9 06:31:46 2015 UTC,"Can you elaborate on what you mean when you say ""setting up GI in after effects""? In terms of what aspect. If you have a GI pass ready to go, usually it should be set as an additive layer and you can then process it however you feel to fit the scene.  Also the ""programs"" I'm referring to are actually render engines which each have their own method of producing GI which will differ from one another and produce different results based on the type of scene."
animation,38xtk7,warriortah,1 point,Tue Jun 9 07:53:30 2015 UTC,"I guess I mean is there a particular process or methodology that you have seen used in AE that is effective when lighting a scene.

animation,38xtk7,rargar,1 point,Tue Jun 9 15:18:28 2015 UTC,"Ah. Well. Again. Totally depends on what passes you have.  I personally like working non destructively, and usually render out additive passes. I often split the scene up into different layers via z-depth too. Since building depth of field in post is much easier if you have separate foreground/background elements.  In AE, I put everything on additive except the shadow layers which I'd put on multiply to start off with.  To be honest. There's no real ""secret"" to getting it looking good. It's all about knowing what you want your shot to look like, and then taking whatever steps are necessary to get there."
animation,38xtk7,ericluster,1 point,Tue Jun 9 20:49:40 2015 UTC,"When you say working non destructively do you mean leaving all passes as separate entities so you have more freedom for tweaks?

animation,38u7jg,warriortah,2,Sat Jun 6 22:42:09 2015 UTC,"this is looking really promising! there are a few things you will want to look out for though that will really sell the weight of the object. first, you want to lift not all at once, but first bring the box back, into the rig's center of gravity. while doing this, you'll want to make sure you are dropping his butt soyou can see the change in weight from just his torso, to his torso and the box. then you'll want to lift with the legs, pelvis, and back in a staggered way, so that the legs lift, causing overlap on the torso, then his pelvis, followed by the back.   also remember, when you're going through this, if you lift a heavy box, odds are you'll lift it higher than it needs to go, and then it settles into you're chest, absorbing the weight over your center of gravity, what's causing some of the floatyness is the even spacing of the box which slows too evenly on his leg.  the acting itself is looking solid, I think if you can touch up some of the interaction spacing/timing, this will be a truly amazing piece. keep it up good sir/madam"

animation,38u7jg,ferretface99,2,Sat Jun 6 23:42:18 2015 UTC,"he seems off balance when he pauses on one leg.  Perhaps if the right leg came back into a step behind him, it would rectify this imbalance, and also show the momentum of lifting a heavy object. I like how his hands pick up the box, and I like the blink too. When he does put his right foot down, it looks really floaty.  like you've just gone from the balancing pose to a standing pose: you can see the joints slide from one pose to the other. good start!  Remember to exaggerate!"

If you wanna stay with that action, go ahead an exaggerate it a bit more! Or better, do it with the arm and leg facing the camera so it's not lost. Very smooth!"

Like you're waving to someone in the distance.  Waving?   Take note of how much your chest is moving. Even your butt will be moving a little bit. In your shot you have adjustments etc on the box, which is great. But they're all isolated movements. Every part of the body has weight, just as the box itself does.

animation,38u13u,MidasClaw,1 point,Thu Jun 11 19:53:13 2015 UTC,I guess the most simplest rigging would be a stiff wire attached to a weight. basically you want the wire to be stiff enough to take the whole weight of the puppet with out bending then it will hold your puppet still while you animate it also helps with running and jumping sequences since it can take the full weight of the puppet. the rig can be digitally removed before your final cut.

animation,38k7kx,pixel_illustrator,12,Fri Jun 5 01:10:28 2015 UTC,...you are fundamentally misunderstanding my point. I don't doubt that the artist did not intend for these to have a political point to them. She most certainly does not.

That said, I think categorizing things like the large eyes under ""unrealistic beauty standards"" is missing the mark a little bit. Maybe it's a matter of semantics, but I feel like ""cute"" is a different goal than ""beautiful."" It's still important to have discussions like these, since having a ""cute"" hero character isn't any more progressive than a ""beautiful"" one, but this might not be the way to go about it. I dunno, just my two cents."
animation,38k7kx,Anodesu,16,Thu Jun 4 20:45:20 2015 UTC,"I took a lot of lessons on character archetypes in college for animation, and honestly, in the discussion of gender biases in design, I did notice a few distinct aspects when researching the four main character archetypes: Tough, Tricky, Cute and Goofy.  I had a very rough time finding many females that fit the tough or goofy form. The one exception for 'goofy' I found was DeeDee from Dexter's Lab, who follows the whole notion of large gangly limbs, big feet, tiny body, no chin, not much of a top of the head, etc. I actually went out of my way to think of characters that fell under those prominently male archetypes."
animation,38k7kx,TheYambag,3,Thu Jun 4 23:38:53 2015 UTC,"I had a very rough time finding many females that fit the tough or goofy form.   But you have to remember that what makes a story compelling is being able to identify with a character. In real life, he vast majority (""majority"" being a keyword.... do not accuse me of using the word ""all"" for this statement)... the majority of women would rather be cute than tough or tricky... and I'm not sure why that is so frowned upon. We're at this weird junction where we constantly scream to other people that whatever our desires may be, as long as it doesn't effect other people, we should be free to chase and work towards those desires. Then at the same time, if we say stuff like ""It's a problem that girls have to want to look cute"".  Can't we just let people be free to have their own desires."
animation,38k7kx,Anodesu,4,Fri Jun 5 13:31:52 2015 UTC,"You make a fair point. There aren't that many women in media still, with the ratio still being 3:1, and so when you do have a female, they want to make the portrayal relatively positive, but in turn, it becomes quite generic to appeal to the masses.  I, however, feel that men are the same in regards to wanting to be portrayed in a positive manner, the goofy character isn't supposed to be necessarily relatable in all regards. They're meant to be their own character, which is, in my opinion, the best form of character design. A character that the viewer/player can relate too much to becomes essentially a self-insert, which isn't something you really want. It means the character is too shallow to be fleshed out and be their own person.  There was a great article called ""I hate strong female characters"" which makes the point of arguing that they aren't trying to go beyond a female character being anything besides 'strong' and 'spunky' nowadays. There have been a lot of shows lately that have gone beyond this and have some of my favourite female characters ever: Brooklyn nine nine, Steven Universe, Gravity Falls... the characters all have fantastic quirks that intrigue and infuriate me. I'm totally okay with women portrayed in ways that aren't strictly attractive. I got pretty sick of ""Fairy Tail"" for their serious case of everyone having the same body type and face.  I'm a sucker for character design since I'm in the field of animation and adore comic books. Some of my closest friends are professionals in the field and we love designing characters for fun. I myself play a lot of D&D, more specifically, Pathfinder, and I drew my team. I have a male friend who plays a female Tiefling who is supposed to be simultaneously the most attractive character in the party stat-wise, but also frightening because she is a Tiefling. People are genuinely unsettled by her appearance, which makes me smile."

I'm not arguing that women don't like strong female characters, I'm arguing that women would rather identify with a primarily cute character more than a primarily tough or tricky character.  If a woman is truly butch, she's rarely going to be well received (though I'm sure there are examples where it has been pulled off in a positive light). Take the meat packing scene from The Boondock Saints, this woman is very strong and tough and independent, but not that many girls are going to identify with her (regardless of the lesbian thing).  So sure, it's nice when a woman has power, but as a general rule, women (specifically women, but men too) would rather see a cute girl with less power than a butch girl who is more powerful. If only one attribute can be picked, ""attractive"" is the one that most women want most in an on screen woman.  Worth pointing out that men want an attractive girl too, but I'm trying to convey this post from the perspective of the female audience. We tend to circle jerk that ""men only want a girl for looks"", and I think it's important to recognize that females want the same thing...

Oh- and I hated early Dreamworks films (Shrek - monsters vs aliens). Starting at around Kung-Fu Panda, Dreamworks changed how they did their eyes, and now they look a lot better.

animation,38msxp,soundofperseverance_,1 point,Fri Jun 5 05:53:31 2015 UTC,"Hey there soundofperseverance!  Animator here, happy to lend some advice.  First off, I can relate to everything you're saying. Like you, I also attended a fine arts school that didn't specialize in animation.  And just like you, I had the same exact worries and concerns!  I was super paranoid.  Anyway, despite the crazy anxiety and fears I had during my time as an undergrad, I was able to land a job in the animation business right out of college, and I've been happily employed ever since.  So here's what helped me:    Undoubtedly, it's easy to feel overwhelmed with all the different software options out there (After-Effects, Maya, Toonboom, Flash, etc.).  To ease your feelings of anxiety, my advice to you is this: dedicate your time and energy to learning one thing at a time, and start with the thing that interests you most.  Something I often keep in mind when feeling overwhelmed is a quote by Mark Twain where he said “The secret of getting ahead is getting started. The secret of getting started is breaking your complex overwhelming tasks into small manageable tasks, and starting on the first one.”  Another thing that really helped me, when I was an undergrad, was surrounding myself with the other creative people interested in animation.  Because I went to a fine arts school, the students who were interested in animation were few and far between, but I made it a point to find these individuals.  Despite my social anxiety, I forced myself to meet other creative people. (By the way, how I became a little less introverted is a whole other topic I can elaborate on since it was a new skill-set I had to learn as well, but I'll save that for another time)  The friends I made not only pushed and inspired me, but they assisted me with the questions I had regarding programs I needed help with.  When you surround yourself with other like-minded creative individuals you'll undoubtedly grow as an artist.    Lastly, internships were paramount to my learning.  Being around pros and seeing what it's like inside a studio environment is the next best thing to collaborating with your creative friends.  While working for free can suck, internships at a studio can do so much for your growth as an artist.  Find studios in your area that specialize in art/animation, pick up the phone and call them.  I landed my first internship just by cold-calling a studio!  You'd be surprised at how receptive some people are if you're polite and show your eagerness to work.  Anyway, those are some quick tips that I hope you can find some value in.  Take advantage of your summer break and remember to chunk it down.  Also, see if you can collaborate on a project with your friends, and maybe inquire about internships in your area.   Please let me know if this advice was helpful at all.  And if you have anymore questions regarding your goals and fears related to animation, feel free to message me.  Remember, I was once in your shoes!  I'm always happy to lend a helping hand.  May the force be with you. ;)"
animation,38msxp,Driver_Art,2,Fri Jun 5 09:32:36 2015 UTC,"I think I can relate to you the most. I am extremely introverted and shy, but hearing from you really clears things up for me a bit. I am testing the waters and seeing which specialization I am most interested in. I live in NYC, while there aren't a lot of internships with animation in my area, I would like to take the time to work on my skills before I do see an opportunity and tackle it. While I do get along with a lot of the people in my art department, I am extremely shy and introverted. I'm interested in hearing on your skills on breaking from that btw. Thanks, your advice is helpful and interested in talking to you more on this"
animation,38msxp,Driver_Art,1 point,Fri Jun 5 17:01:09 2015 UTC,"Glad to hear my advice was helpful!  Indeed, having technical skills is key, but artists often forget that learning ""soft skills"" can often times be just as important to your growth as an artist and a professional.  Just know that being introverted and shy is totally normal.  You're definitely not alone on this, and it isn't something you should feel bad about it. Keep in mind that most people around you feel the same exact way, although it might not always seems like it.  For me breaking out of my social anxiety all started with learning how to break the ice.  There are many different ways you can do this (again, I can elaborate on this in much greater detail with more tactical advice, but I'll keep it brief here so you don't get overwhelmed), but the easiest thing to do is to simply just ask questions about ANYTHING (i.e. the weather, assignments, classes, current events, etc.)  The point is you just need to get the conversation going.   I used to feel really awkward about talking to my classmates, teachers, and co-workers because I was nervous about breaking the ice.  But just know that once you get over your fear of doing this, a conversation between you and another person might just blossom into something great.  That next person you talk to might just end up becoming your animation partner, mentor, best friend, or even future boss.  Also, you mentioned your hesitation with finding internships for two reasons:  1.) Your worried about internship opportunities based on your geographical location. 2.) It sounds like you want to get better as an artist BEFORE you go about finding an internship.  I have two thoughts regarding this.  To answer your first concern, there are TONS of internship opportunities out there especially in NYC.  Understand, that you don't necessarily need an internship at an animation studio to benefit as an artist.  I have a friend who claims that one the best internships she ever had was at a commercial studio.  There she learned how to use photoshop, after-effects and even Maya! As an added bonus, she made friends with fellow interns there who helped get her gigs in the animation industry much later in life.  Lastly, in regards to your second concern, get an internship now regardless of your skill level.  Internships help you grow in so many ways.  They give you insight into the industry which will inevitably shape the way you take action towards your goals.  Saying that you wanna get better before you get an internship is like saying ""I wanna get fit before I go to the gym.""  Your mentality should be the opposite.  Get the internship so you can improve and grow as an artist!  I hope this insight helps!  Again, feel free to message me back and let me know if you have any other questions or concerns.  Best of luck to you!"
animation,38msxp,hamadubai,1 point,Fri Jun 5 19:52:27 2015 UTC,"Thanks, you make good points here. I have worked as a web design intern last summer at a non profit organization. Did not like it, however at least I know I would not like that sort of job, and I can see why any internship could benefit regardless because I was able to get accustomed to a work environment and translating my employer's visions into a design at least. As with the networking, I actually do make small talk with a lot of people I come across, and I get along very well with much of my professors (I have a tendency to get along better with professors and teachers from past experience). However, I think I often confused networking with making friends. I don't have much friends, but I do know a lot of people if that makes sense? Not only other art majors but also computer science, english, etc. The only problem is I am quite shy and don't hang out with people after school, but I would need to be more open with myself with other people who have the same interests as I do with animation. Thanks again for that advice! Just another question, I am just not entirely sure what I can do as of right now in terms of making a reel or preparing myself to be a good animator. There is specialization and learning programs I am most interested in, but would having strong draftsmanship skills also help? Practicing more figure drawing? What sort of classes would also be beneficial to me? etc. Not sure if you get my drift."

animation,38msxp,alanimation,1 point,Fri Jun 5 16:44:58 2015 UTC,"professional animator working for DHX for 8 years now.  in all honesty you want to learn 2d animation, even if you want to ultimately do 3d, motion graphics or whatever. learn 2d animation first. get yourself Richard William's Animation Survival Kit, go through the whole thing, from beginning to end and practice it all. doesn't matter what program you use because the skills are transferable, it's just changing what the shortcut keys are really. if you do use flash or anything with a tween function don't use it, frame by frame it by hand.  and post your work up as often as you can for honest critique, and I really mean honest critique. while getting the ""wow you're so talented"" messages are nice, you want to find people that know what they're talking about, let them fix your stuff, tell you where you've gone wrong and what you've done right and don't let it hurt you. so many people get incredibly hurt and defensive when their work is critiqued even after working in the industry for 10+ years."
animation,38msxp,Dark_Souls,1 point,Fri Jun 5 16:57:55 2015 UTC,"this needs to be up higher.   I work at a small place, very tiny, and out of everyone I've seen come and go, the people with drawing skills are the most successful, even if they are doing 3D. I studied hard in 3D and got hired in 2D. Go figure. Never hurts to know a bit everything. After awhile it all becomes the same...a timeline, a stage, and your skills."
animation,38msxp,MarcHendry,0,Fri Jun 5 17:43:05 2015 UTC,"Hi, animation student here. What you should be aware of is that specialization is extremely important in the industry. You can be a generalist, but that signifies generalist in a field (3D generalist for instance). You are best off finding out something to really put your time into and getting good at that, or your reel will not show enough skill in any one discipline to stand out. For instance, some skills just within 3D include: character animation, lighting, compositing, texturing/shading, environment modeling, character modeling. Don't bite off more than you can chew."
animation,38msxp,MarcHendry,2,Fri Jun 5 23:33:49 2015 UTC,"To further this point. If you want to be a generalist, you'll still usually start as a specialist. Then gain more skills as you branch out."

animation,38m1ej,nethodsod,2,Fri Jun 5 02:25:46 2015 UTC,"I really enjoyed it! I felt engaged the whole time and it flowed fairly seamlessly a good amount of the time. my only suggestion is maybe adding variation to your line size next time. when there were lots of lines it distracted from the flow of the piece. I feel as though the plethora of lines was an artistic choice and I respect that, but from a viewer perspective, just slight variation might make the images easier to digest. otherwise I loved it! I would be very interested in seeing more of your work.   I also make experimental (music) videos and it would mean a lot if you checked them out!  vimeo.com/hodosart"
animation,38m1ej,arross,1 point,Fri Jun 5 04:09:46 2015 UTC,"The variation to line size is definitely a good point!  As to the large number of lines, that was on purpose. I personally enjoy art that is overwhelming, where you can't possible get it all at once. That does run counter to traditional animation goals, but most experimental art defies at least one generally accepted rule or concept.  Of your videos, I watched ""Wistful,"" ""Mobbin,"" and ""Chosen."" I enjoyed all of them, but I think Chosen was the most professional looking, although it was much narrower in concept, that might have lead to a lot better control on your part.  In mobbin, I thought it was really cool where someone was half heartedly lip syncing, and I actually laughed a little when he started drinking but the rap kept going!  Wistful was cool, for example where you have the ""bifocal"" lens, and the kaleidoscope effects mixed with real imagery. Those were really cool! I do think a couple things made it look a little amateur though.   The shaky camera (which I figure was intentional) gave it a hand camera, not professional feel. Again, if you want that, that's alright, lofi can be cool. The other thing, is that it has a lot of ""photoshop filters"" applied to it. At least from the perspective of a painter (which is my primary artistic practice) heavy use of filters is something that I always hear the better painters talking down on, so they naturally make me think of beginners.  To condense that, Wistful has some cool techniques, but the shaky camera and all the color filters make it feel somewhat amateur. You can probably figure out some more skillful ways to use both, and you definitely do a better job of playing with color on Chosen, where you had less elements to juggle.  I hope that's helpful!"

I guess if you're gonna plonk down several hundred million dollars on a film, you're gonna want it to be as tried-and-true as possible.

Next step you should take is trying to mimic real balls of different materials and weights and see how you can portray the physics different.

I have written a children's book called 'There Is a Pug On My Head' and I want to gift a portion of the proceeds to organizations that encourage the adoption of older animals. The story is written in fun quirky rhyme and tells about a boy who wants a pup and when his Mom brings an older dog home, at first he is disappointed. The other message within the story is that if we look past our physical differences we can often find a good friend. I would like to create an inter active E book. I am also curious how difficult sound would be to incorporate? Thanks so much!  Another redditor kindly put me in touch with illustrators but until I find out if there are people capable of doing both I don't want to make any promises or create disappointment."

Yes, they both star toys, but this one is set in a wooden world while Toy Story tries to be photorealistic with many more materials, including real flesh and blood humans.   Yeah, Lego Movie seems like the best bet. That one is a world where everything is made of lego except for very rare items. It's different that it's plastic instead of painted wood, but even the special effects are made of lego, and the characters actually pop apart (usually unintentionally).   Paper Monsters could qualify, it's a phone game staring a little cardboard dude in an origami Mario ripoff."

animation,38ahlp,aartist90,1 point,Wed Jun 3 12:15:58 2015 UTC,"Well if you just wanted practice using after effects, you got that for sure.  But I don't know if this is something you should put on a demo reel.  The work here is very simple, there's just a lot of it.  So I'd try to focus on making small areas of the project a lot more interesting (both the animation and the story) and using the chorus as a place to return to the more monotonous kin-type.  You want a little 6-second bit for your reel, maybe.  So make 6 seconds amazing and just screw around and learn from the rest.  At this point in your schooling you can't afford to spend forever trying to make a whole minute look pretty.  And grades do NOT matter enough in art school for you to be obligated to follow a teachers' rubric.  Do make their imposed requirements work for YOU!    I like that it looks clean, that goes a long way towards professionalism.  The style is pretty consistent throughout, which is another plus.  But I was bored.  The world has seen a shit-ton of kinetic typography, so you need to up the creativity a bit.  But this is a good start and you obviously enjoy doing this, right? So stick to it and watch everything on vimeo to see what people are doing with motion graphics these days.  You can get some awesome ideas from other people's work...just don't plagiarize lol.  I hope this helps.  Keep animating!"

If you want critique on specific animations you should isolate them.  You really really need a new mic, and you need to make sure it's not clipping when you're recording. Besides that the ambient noise was too sparse and too loud. Really tough to listen to. Music could have helped set the mood too."

My two cents:   a little less reverb on the girl's ""inner voice"" turn up the volume +2 or +3dBfs on the girl's voice learn how to do some basic EQing.   A very simplified ""howto EQ"":   90% of the time you use EQs to cut frenquencies, not boost them. All voice recordings could use a ""locut"", EQ that cuts the lower frequencies (below 60 Hz, fiddle with that threshold, see if you can bring it up to 80 or 100Hz without removing too much ""warmth"" , especially in the male voice) Find the frequency ranges of the voice acting, then cut as much of those frequencies out of the music when they are both playing at the same time. (your EQed music will probably sound weird all by itself). That will make the voice more audible without lowering all the music. (a reference from Wikipedia “The average man’s speaking voice, for example, typically has a fundamental frequency between 85 Hz and 155 Hz. A woman’s speech range is about 165 Hz to 255 Hz, and a child’s voice typically ranges from 250 Hz to 300 Hz and higher.”)"

People will forgive some pretty tired concepts if they're presented with a novel or subversive twist. The key here is make it interesting!  Also, quit exhausting your energy making these super-power stat sheets, and spend a few paragraphs diving into these kids' goals, relationships and problems. I get it... they're babies; and it's a comedy... but so what? We're not talking Shakespeare-level stuff here. Look at similar shows like the Powerpuff Girls for a lesson in sincere and comedic character development with young protagonists. At the very least, expand on the caretakers; they're in a good position to be our relatable audience surrogates, so make them just as interesting.  And speaking of problems, the antagonist(s) in a superhero story cannot be understated; as the foils to our heroes, they're arguably the most critical part of the whole cartoon -- and yet they're no-where to be found on your KS page, and barely mentioned in your video.   And just in case you're withholding potentially-interesting story points and character info from the KS page for fear of copycats or something... then you're doing yourself a great disservice! STAHP!! Divulge as much info as you would comfortably share with any network exec, because you're not going to attract any backers on puns and charisma alone -- especially if you have no pre-existing following.  This isn't meant to be a mean-spirited put-down of what is likely a passion project; just a concerned, fellow cartoon-creator who has seen many missed opportunities with KS that started with a poor concept execution -- usually stemming from a situation where the creator did not reach beyond the opinions of their friends and family for much needed critique. Hopefully this is not the case and you've got a grand master plan.  Good luck!"

animation,37ygul,Mannex,1 point,Sun May 31 16:50:53 2015 UTC,Looks great but I'm confused by the action. Did she accidentally pour out the bucket? Why does seem so pleased about it?   I don't think you need to do basic exercises at all. If your comfortable animating full figures then do that. Weight and squash and stretch never made as much sense to me as when I actually applied them to real animation and not just some trivial exercise
animation,37ygul,Siegecow,1 point,Sun May 31 18:31:36 2015 UTC,"I was aiming for a bit of effort but I can see how it looks accidental, I think I was trying to illustrate that good feeling after work is over. Do you have any bigger advice? this was done in Photoshop CS5"
animation,37ygul,Siegecow,1 point,Sun May 31 19:02:01 2015 UTC,"I guess most of my suggestions are about the way she handles the pail.   She should be using the handle with one hand and the other should be tilting the bucket from the bottom to pour out the water. She also might use the ledge to rest the bucket on if it's too heavy. Having her hold the pail close to her body makes it look like shes trying to keep it secure.  There needs to be ""anticipation"" (an essential animation concept to know if you don't already) of the heavy action of lifting the bucket  Then there needs to be a beat after the exertion of her labor. Once the water is out of the bucket, maybe she relaxes briefly, maybe she sighs. Then she should transition to her next pose and look relieved.  I think the look of pride and satisfaction could also be communicated a tad more clearly. Maybe a stretch, a mopping of the brow, sighing, etc.  This is really strong work for a first animation. I can see the arm movement clearly even though there are no outlines, and the walk cycle is great even though you cant see the legs."
animation,37ygul,SanityFalls,1 point,Sun May 31 19:52:33 2015 UTC,"Hello, I love the style and you're pretty consistent with volumes. Unfortunately I don't see many principles applied, I feel like you animated it straight ahead, which is fine but you need to be a bit more used to animate. What I suggest to you, besides starting with the basics and not going right away into character animation, is to film yourself doing the action and study it, as much as possible. You can use a timer to see how long the action should take and how many key poses you see into the action. How long do they take? Is the struggle longer than the last part of the action? When is an action taking longer? When is it fast? Keep these things in consideration, create strong poses to start with (strong line of actions, remember the s shape to keep it natural and such) and figure out the timing to add the pose in betweens. Good luck and keep it up!"

animation,380iny,Tomb760,1 point,Mon Jun 1 02:06:18 2015 UTC,pretty simple. It's a character with a large creature bursting out of them. But if you couldn't tell then I should probably work on conveying that better.
animation,380iny,alextbrown4,2,Mon Jun 1 02:12:42 2015 UTC,Looks cool but I'd just like to point out that isn't really an animatic. By definition an animatic is pretty much a story board animation with little to no movement. The point is to portray the key points of the story.  You use the animatic to help figure out the timing of your animation.   What you have here is a short animation of what looks like spider legs busting out of a dudes back which looks pretty cool btw.

I want to populate the environment with more stuff. (Ex. trashcans in the alley). I will add postFX like color grading. I will add audio of course. Hopefully some music too. It will be rendered at a higher resolution. [1920x1080] More rain. The sunlight beam will have a ray of light. That black line that rendered in the first shot.

But as a thesis film for college? Like, GRADUATING from an animation program? Oh Jeez. It is not good. It is not good at all. Was that a four year program? In all that time, didn't anyone ever tell you that your skills are just not up to par? Or did they allow you to believe that your subpar work was just fine? Or if anyone did tell you that your work is subpar, did you ignore them?  Where do I even start? The sound is all wrong. There is poor timing, inconsistent volume, too much reuse, the sounds are not modified to suit the environment (echos and such) and so on...  The animation is sloppy and simplistic. Motion is always eased improperly ... for example, things that are further away should move perceptively slower. But they don't.  Your frame by frame animation is shaky, simplistic, and amateurish. The lines are thick and jagged. The way the characters move is all wrong. There's no weight, perspective, 3D feel,  or realism to any of it.  The backgrounds look like they were slapped together in Photoshop using stock brush tools. I'm right, aren't I?  It's just bad. I'm so sorry. I don't want to be mean, but someone has to tell you. I hope you haven't been surrounded by yes-men this whole time with their hands over their eyes. The other commenters in this thread seem to have no idea what quality of animation to expect from an animation program graduate. This is not it.  I don't know what advice to give you. Probably you will find it very hard, if not impossible to find animation work. I've seen some of very skilled artists and animators who just can't find a job because the industry is so competitive, and so much animation is being done overseas.

What i would do, is either try your best with brush (Free hand) or use a line tool, and set it to 15.00, at 100% zoom.  You can press 'J' to toggle between Object Drawing, and Shape. Shape is the black line being moved around. Object is when the whole thing moves when you drag it. You can also break an Object, this turns it into a shape, and then move it how you wish."
animation,37tu6s,Teid,6,Sat May 30 09:51:16 2015 UTC,Ever hear the term Rome wasn't built in a day. Animation takes time and patience plus passion. Really it's up to you.  The two tools an animator uses the most is a pencil and an eraser. They don't draw things perfect every time.
animation,37tu6s,MidasClaw,5,Sat May 30 11:15:51 2015 UTC,"The advice I give everyone is to just draw, draw, draw. Carry a sketchbook with you. Draw on the train, draw waiting for an appointment, draw before class, draw during class. The more you draw, the more you'll realize that each drawing isn't sacred. You are drawing for muscle memory and practice. Draw from life. Being able to do quick, clear gesture drawings will help you in animation. You don't have to go to Cal Arts to get a career in an animation studio. I know people who work for Disney, Dreamworks, Blue Sky and tons of other small animation and game studios. What it takes is tons of hard work, practice and dedication. It's not an easy industry, but everyone that I know who really deserves a job has gotten one eventually."
animation,37tu6s,OhNoBees,2,Sat May 30 11:56:02 2015 UTC,"Hell.  I can't draw.  but I can take photographs, work with masking layers and smart objects...lay out what I want, import to Illustrator, Blob brush trace, cleanup and shade. Send back to photoshop for color, and texture, and move through motion in AE.  Your animation and my animation will not look the same...but I animate, and I create my vision and my vision matches my creative limitations.  I could have never worked in the 1950s. Today I am fine. Animation takes many paths to success. Just because drawing isn't interesting to an individual doesn't mean all paths are closed.  I will say though, that if you don't like to draw...double your training time. SO if traditional animation practices get you into industry in 3-4 years...alternatives take 6-8 years...but you can do it.  I can't stand to draw traditionally, but it hasn't stopped me...just forced a longer route to the same goal."
animation,37tu6s,AlvinBlah,3,Sat May 30 22:32:14 2015 UTC,"This is true. It's also true for some of the 3d animators I know.

Seemed like this guy was asking specifically about hand drawn. But this is important to note that there is more than one way to be successful in animation."

animation,37tu6s,AlvinBlah,3,Sun May 31 01:03:11 2015 UTC,"Most creators of animated shows have some drawing skill, they need to be able to draw to really help the show get to where they want it. Look at Brad Bird, Rebecca Sugar, Justin Roiland... it helps, and is used for a lot of important things. Glen Keane would draw over poses in ""tangled"" to show their animators how to push a pose further. It's going to be a very useful tool for you in the future.  A lot of studios like Frederator or Nelvana will actually let people from the studio pitch concepts too, regardless of position. People in HR sometimes pitch ideas.   Besides practicing drawing, what you should really gun for as well is a knowledge of the tools being used today. You're a 2D animator? Go learn Flash and Toon Boom. Probably also learn 3D animation as well, though, Source Filmmaker is free on steam with a bunch of their rigs. Blender is also free and has made some awesome shorts. Get storyboard Pro and Photoshop as well to practice drawing digitally and just draw. Doesn't matter what your skill is, there are SOO many tutorials out there.  It's unlikely you'll start in a directing position. Not completely impossible, just highly unlikely. Don't let that get you down or anything, this is a cool field to be in. A lot of your learning will come after graduating postsecondary too.  So yeah, just start drawing. Get the loomis PDF's and practice. Learn the principles of design as well as animation.

Prepare to take criticism, and LEARN from what people are saying - it's very obvious when people are just shitting on work for the sake of it, and when they are giving constructive feedback. Your ideas will get torn apart piece by piece and analyzed but be flexible, do not take it to heart and accept that sometimes your ideas (your babies) are not always going to be great.  And lastly!

When you say 'create a show' are you going to be animating or copywriting?  You can't animate a show if you don't know how to animate. But - all you have to do is learn. Learn the basics, become comfortable with it, and you'll be less likely to get fed up while aiming for a specific outcome - because it's easier to make a concept a reality when you have the technical skill to do so. When I plan out an animation I'm thinking about the exact tools and techniques I'll use to execute each step.   Also, people who get television deals on things like Cartoon Network have hardcore connections. One of the reasons people go to these big art institutes is to become apart of a network. You got to know some people in that industry, otherwise I don't know who you'll be 'pitching' this show to.   Also, don't get discouraged and give up in the middle of a project.

animation,37r1o4,quitefunny,6,Fri May 29 18:34:56 2015 UTC,"The arm swing has a nice arc from the side views. In fact, everything looks great from the side. Maybe from the front, you could add a little figure 8 motion so the line of movement seems a little less straight. Same goes with the feet. As you can see from the front, they appear to kind of stick in the air for a moment. I think a little side to side movements can help break that uniformity up.  And this is more of a personal preference, but I think the distance between his fists and body at the middle of the arm swing look a bit ""girly."" It reminds me of those run cycles that anime girls sometimes have. It would probably look more masculine if his arms remained closer during the swing down. From a side view, it doesn't seem odd, so it's probably just a matter of adjusting his arms on one axis.  Edit: Come to think of it, is this character a boy or a girl?"

animation,37r1o4,SecretlyAnonymous,2,Fri May 29 22:34:34 2015 UTC,"For a first, that's awesome!  My biggest and shortest critique would be, make the passing poses (not sure if I'm using that term correctly at the moment) quicker, and the ""hang"" poses slower.  What I mean is, hang the limbs longer at the extremes.. like when the feet and hands are furthest forward/backward, when the character is up in the air. And make them swing through the middle (when one foot touches the ground) faster. In shorter words, exaggerate the spacing (or exaggerate the ease in/ease out) between extremes.   I think this will counteract the dullness you perceive in having the arms closer to the torso. In my opinion, having the arms that far out lacks force and is unnatural.   Also as /u/jessejayjones mentioned, you could have his extremities (hands and feet) drag behind slightly to create ""whip"" or s-shape movements which could add life/dynamism/weight."
animation,37r1o4,slymagpie,6,Sat May 30 00:17:56 2015 UTC,"I want to say one thing right off the bat: this is pretty good. This wall of text I've got here is only because I'm going through the cycle piece by piece. Trust me, pretty much any animation, even Pixar-quality, could have notes this long if someone took a close enough look at it. So don't think I'm judging you or anything.    Looks good from the side, though I'd suggest you have each elbow bend more as the arm goes back and less as it comes forward, to add a bit of drag. (If you've already done so, I'd say it's not enough, because I'm not seeing it.)  From the front, I would pull the arms in more. If you're looking to exaggerate the poses, I'd turn the arms inward on the contact pose (when the arms are stretched the farthest front-to-back), so that the hands cross in front of and behind the torso. Go somewhere private and pantomime an exaggerated, strutting walk (arms swinging proudly, think Gaston), and you'll get an idea of what I'm talking about. (You can drag the wrists too, but start with the elbows.)  Also from the front, the head bob is nice, but it could use some side-to-side bobbing as well, probably offset from the forward bobbing (forward-bob, left-bob, forward-bob, right-bob, forward-bob... and so on). So that it moves more with the swaying of the torso. For that matter, the torso could probably use a bit of forward bobbing as well, and I'd probably pull the side-to-side swing back just a frame or two to make it look more like drag.  Now, the legs. From the front, there's some scary knee-wobbling going on. I'm not sure how this particular rig is set up, but you'll want to lock the knees to the feet if you can, at least for starters. Should be an easy fix, though.  The feet are fairly robotic. Look again at those front and side views. The toes aren't dragging at all, or even bending as the heel comes up. Take a look at this and this. I know the first one's a walk cycle, but it's easier to see what I mean in that one.  Plus, the feet are perfectly straight forward the whole time, as though they're on a track. Not really your fault, since most walk-cycle teaching methods try to make it a formula, but now it's your job to break that. In other words, this is where it gets fun.    Try tilting the feet outward, or inward, or outward as they swing and inward when they land, or inward as they swing and outward when they land. Pull them farther out as they swing and cross them in front of one another when they land, or cross them over the center line when they swing and bring them farther out when they land (think rollerskating). Raise them higher, drop them lower, push their highest point forward, push it back.  For that matter, go back to the arms, or the torso, or the head, and move them around as well. Try adding way too much drag, and try tightening the drag to where it's almost nonexistent. Try giving your character lots of hang time with both feet off the ground, and try giving him none at all. Have some fun, stretch some boundaries, take the rig to its farthest point and then see if it can go farther. Go full-on Ministry of Silly Walks on this guy. Play with it. Not every combination will work, but every combination will teach you something.  Walk and run cycles are two of the most powerful expressions and explorations of character. So go express and explore."

animation,37r1o4,Redragon143,2,Sat May 30 00:47:05 2015 UTC,"Yeah dude, nice way to soak up the crit!  I was coming here to say pretty much the same. Try bending the elbows more when the arms are behind the torso. If you observe the arms of an actual runner there are many different styles, some use them like pistons, coiled at the back and almost straight when forwards. Some runners, particularly long distance just hold them tight to the body. So here is alot about the character that can be conveyed in how they move through space.  Also for a solid understanding of walkcycles you should familiarize yourself with Preston Blair's work, he has great illustrated fundamentals and also Richard Williams's book The Animators Survival Kit which is mostly about exploring and exaggerating  walk cycles."
animation,37r1o4,CoryTheDuck,2,Sat May 30 07:17:38 2015 UTC,"Hey, looking good! Keep practicing those run and walk cycles. And yes, always always always exaggerate, it will make your animations more appealing and interesting to watch. Better to exaggerate too much and pull it back if you need to. If you're looking for critique, the foot hangs in the back on the lift and floats a bit before coming forward. You could also loosen it up by having the wrists and ankles drag behind before snapping forward. Really great job! :)"

animation,37tael,gizmah,3,Sat May 30 05:26:20 2015 UTC,"Nice stuff. I am going to share some of my thoughts.    Bullet - Add easy ease on your objects. Everything has the same timing right now. You could also try adding a little more follow through.  Beer Warrior - The entire piece is too long. The action feel like it's dragging throughout. I would suggest speeding up the action, especially when the logo is coming up. That entire logo pop-up could/should happen in 1.5 seconds at most. Add some follow through and easing and it will start to feel a lot more dynamic.  Church - The action is nice but the green and blue colors are not working. They mash and don't work together. Try to work with colors more from a pallet. If this is someone else's logo, then there's not much you can do about it. :) Spinning Circle - Very nice! The motion is fluid and dynamic. You've added ease in/out and it really makes a difference. I would apply the same ideas about staying within a color pallet on this too.  Jobs - Simple and straightforward.  I love the organic generation from the top two letters. I think the 'Nick Kidd' scale a little bit weirdly. It doesn't scale proportionally and maybe because if it did, it would overlap the main text? You could try move your anchor point around so the text can scale from a different location while maintaining it's shape. Nice and clean. I like the stick-on effect. The underline text could have an ease out on it so it doesn't 'lock' into place as much when it hits.    Overall pretty good stuff!  Keep up the hard work and continue to polish, polish, polish! :)"

animation,37ngkc,gizmah,3,Thu May 28 22:46:47 2015 UTC,"Depends on your experience level. It's good for both sides of things. I'd say the real strength of the book is that it clinically breaks down cycles and timing charts to help you mechanically understand what's going on. But more than that, it also shows you that a vanilla cycle is just that, and any ""rules"" you're taught can be broken, and shows what happens when you mess with them and explore. And that's where the magic is. His strength is/was as a stunning technition and that book is a great testiment to that. If you're relatively green, work your way through slowly. Do the plain cycles yourself, get a feel for them, and then start messing with the breakdowns to see how that affects the end product. Ultimately you want to be able to express yourself and that will come through time on the clock, experimentation, and fun."

animation,37kiq2,1brokenmonkey,5,Fri May 29 01:05:48 2015 UTC,"Welcome to the most saturated industry since being an ""actor"". Everyone wants to be animators these days and unfortunately since the economy crashed in 2007, jobs have been declining. We have 100's of fresh students graduating from online animation schools and university's every few months, while studios are getting shut down left and right. At this point even the veteran animators are finding it hard to keep a job. It's rough and not enough people realize going into animation just how competitive it has gotten. Not to mention that Motion capture is getting better and more and more studios are no longer hiring traditional hand animators.  But, its not all bad. I have been lucky to consistently find work for the last 4 years. I know it sounds cliche but it really is all about knowing someone. Once you get that first job, you will meet people who used to be at other studios and know people. After my first contract gig I was able to continue finding work just by networking with the people i had met and worked with.  I guess what i am trying to say is, YES, its really really hard to find work right now. Id say 90% of fresh out of school animators wont find work and will probably move on. The key to success is to not give up and keep improving your reel. It took me a year and a half after graduation before i got my big break, and i almost gave up repeatedly. Just keep working on being a better animator and apply everywhere. To be a professional animator today you HAVE to be passionate and persistent. Good luck and don't give up!!"

I'm no master, you can tell what my characters are doing, but it doesnt tell a story. :\ I think, I need help lol"
animation,37kiq2,banecroft,2,Fri May 29 03:05:16 2015 UTC,"For a reel, the general consensus is animation over storytelling. You can always make short films to showcase your storytelling prowess and submit them to film festivals. If you do free ones, then you literally have nothing to lose. I'm currently just sort of animating, but also stockpiling storyline ideas that'll actually work. Hopefully in 2016 I'll be in a better spot than where I'm currently at."

animation,37kiq2,ittekimasu,2,Fri May 29 05:05:27 2015 UTC,As a fellow recent grad myself most studios (at least in my area and from what the heads have talked about) are only really concerned with you're ability to animate. If you can tell a great story that's awesome but as a noob you're most likely just going to start as a junior animator. QUALITY OVER QUANTITY is a biggie too.
animation,37kiq2,OneClassyBloke,2,Mon Jun 1 05:21:31 2015 UTC,Collecting resumes is a practice that may be annoying to the artist since its not immediate work.... but should be viewed as upcoming work.    As an employer... few things are more frustrating than starting a search for good artists AFTER a project has been acquired.

We, a team of 8 Icelandic students (6 ladies & 2 gentlemen), would like to share with you our graduation project from the Multimedia School in Reykjavik (Margmiðlunarskólinn). This 3D animated short was created from scratch over a course of a semester (a little over 4 months). Everything visually related was entirely made by the team. Concept, character design, modeling, rigging, animation, post production... you name it!  The main softwares used were: Maya, Mudbox, Arnold, Nuke, Photoshop and Premiere.  This is the biggest graduation project in our school's history and we are very proud of what we were able to achieve in this time frame. We hope you can enjoy our film and it would be awesome to receive feedbacks from you. Also feel free to ask us anything!  Check out our Facebook page: Berry Ville Productions"

animation,37ihkm,Wuktrio,10,Wed May 27 21:46:41 2015 UTC,"What frame rate is this animated at? It feels very stuttered, especially the front arm at the apex of its swing.  Of all the ""with a twist"" animations I've seen, very few have made me think, ""oh, that was clever."" I know you want your work to stand out from the rest, but your time and effort would probably be better spent going into the quality of animation rather than a gimmick.  Back to the critique - After the character snaps, the arm falls down to his side, but then goes back to the motion from the cycle, which looks weird. Maybe hold the hand up a few more frames until the arm can naturally complete the full swing? Also you could add some slight secondary motion in the wrists."
animation,37ihkm,Kjones3d,3,Wed May 27 23:34:09 2015 UTC,"To add to this guy, I'm also not getting much of a sense of the shoulders or hips rotating with the steps.  Though I'm learning 3D, so it's a bit easier to rotate the shoulders with the swings.  Also, for future learning, the hands drag both direction when the arms are relaxed.  In this the hands are always angled back behind the wrist.  It's a pendulum swing that's just a hair behind the motion of the rest of the arm.."
animation,37ihkm,Andrigaar,1 point,Thu May 28 06:31:43 2015 UTC,"The shoulders definitely show movement. If you look at the base of arms you can see that it moves back and forth too, but I will try to make it look better next time.  Thanks for the tip and have a nice day!"
animation,37ihkm,Kjones3d,2,Thu May 28 08:45:14 2015 UTC,"Thank you very much for your critique (just realised the title is spleed wrong), that's what I came for!  The animation runs at 24 fps, but it is mostly animated on twos (only the finger snapping and the fast movements of the head are on ones.  I will take a closer look at the arms to make them less stuttery, but I think a part of that comes from the fact that I am not really used to using a graphic tablet. However, I will try to make it better and maybe post it again (or do a completely new walk).  You are right, I do want my work to stand out (who doesn't), but I animated the complete walk cycle first and decided to do this when he was already walking. I did something similar with this character as a jump.  Thanks again!"
animation,37ihkm,Kjones3d,1 point,Thu May 28 08:42:47 2015 UTC,"Have you heard of a book called ""The Animator Survival Kit"" by Richard Williams? It's an awesome resource for animators and you should definitely get a copy if you don't have one.  The reason for the stutters is simply because of the placement of the arm in the different drawings. Coming from a 3D animation background myself, the computer placed all of those inbetween drawings for me and I didn't realize just how precise you had to be when drawing them for 2D animation. If you have that arm on a separate layer, it will be much easier to fix.  The hip and shoulder movement Andrigaar is talking about is in the body itself. Yes, the tops of the arms are moving, but the torso is static. A lot of 2D animation today turns this into a shortcut because they just don't have time to animate each and every little thing. For the sake of the art of animation, the hips and shoulders should be animated, but it's not a necessity for the business. (check out the run cycle of Shaggy from the classic Scooby Doo https://youtu.be/X0tUTfZp5OI?t=118)."
animation,37ihkm,Kjones3d,2,Thu May 28 20:20:34 2015 UTC,"Yes, I own the animator's survival kit and I agree, it's awesome!  I will definitely start a new cycle with all these in mind and maybe even work this walk over, but thanks for the critique!"
animation,37ihkm,Artasaurus_alex,1 point,Thu May 28 21:05:49 2015 UTC,I just animated a new walk cycle with all the critique I received here.  Is this one better? The guy walks like a model tho...
animation,37ihkm,StressCavity,1 point,Mon Jun 1 16:22:37 2015 UTC,"You're right, it does look like a model's walk. This is mainly due to the exaggeration of the shoulders and hips. You certainly added in motion in those places, now you need to find the balance. Also, the speed at which he walks (steps per second in the Survival Kit) plays a part in that too.   People will tell you that the wrist movement is still stiff, but that's because you haven't quite figured out the secondary motion of it yet. the wrist should lag behind a frame or two to get a good whip principle going.  Keep it up, this is much improved over the first one."
animation,37ihkm,soundofarthr,1 point,Tue Jun 2 02:05:45 2015 UTC,"Thank you very much!  He runs at twos and these are eight frames per step. I realised that the hands don't follow through after I posted it here, I will change that.  Could it be that the he walks like a model due to stretching his back backwards and walking very upright?  Thank you again and have a nice day!"
animation,37ihkm,soundofarthr,1 point,Tue Jun 2 02:22:32 2015 UTC,"Sorry for the super late reply. I had this typed up and got distracted, but I figured I ought to just finish it up and submit it.  The simple answer is he walks like a model because the poses you drew look like a model walking. You were trying something new (i assume) and this was the result. It's not a bad result, just now exactly what you were expecting. Keep practicing and get some experience drawing the human figure and you'll be in control in no time."

And I am in love with how you start the reel with shots of yourself working at the beginning and end. I've never seen that before, and it does a great job at humanizing you and giving us more to connect with. Since you asked for suggestions, I would say your weakest piece was the black and white airplane with the man falling out, if you wanted to take that out you could probably live without it since your other pieces are so strong. It's also a good idea to include a form of contact on the beginning and end titles. Really fantastic work! :)"

animation,37clvo,kRkthOr,0,Wed May 27 07:36:00 2015 UTC,"The technical aspect was great, but the tone is so saccharine that I had a hard time appreciating it. It definitely has an audience, given the popularity of something like Frozen, but my honest critique would be to work on writing a story with real emotional weight, instead of bombarding it with nonstop cuteness. The reason it works for stuff like Finding Nemo or Up is because it's juxtaposed with pretty frank depictions of the devastatingly sad side of life. I have a feeling I'm going to be downvoted for this, but this is honestly how I feel.   Again, great job on the animation."

Of course, this was a student film comprised of 4 students with very different tastes in artistic styles, storytelling, and humor. One of the obstacles we faced was agreeing on these things. We're happy with the outcome and know there are people out there that will enjoy it- however, this is only the beginning. First we had to prove we were capable of making SOMETHING. Since this was the outcome of that something, now can be our time to really push the boundaries.  I am personally very pleased that you think this. It's the kind of shorts that really push the boundaries that will change animation as a medium. I hope that you will stay tuned with what we're able to come up with in the future or individually. I promise not to disappoint :)  Thanks again! Elizabeth"

Have you made a Hollywood blockbuster? Maybe not, but that wouldn't necessarily discredit a criticism  you might have for the latest transformers movie."

animation,37clvo,mrpistachio13,3,Thu May 28 15:53:22 2015 UTC,"This still falls under the second point I made. I watched it, gave a compliment, as well as a critique. What's the virtue in never giving people constructive criticism? I don't really get your angle. You're not disagreeing with what I said, you're just trying to discredit me as a person. It's called ad hominem, and it doesn't really help anyone. I stand by what I said. I think sentimentality is a good thing, but in order for it to feel true to life you should balance it out with the rest of the spectrum of emotion. The tone of almost all of this animation was cutesy to the point where it felt like the equivalent of overacting. To me. You don't have to agree, but you should try to be more ok with criticism, because it's not actually a bad thing in and of itself."

animation,37ernd,pen0r,2,Wed May 27 02:27:24 2015 UTC,"Looking great, I think overall the legs could use some polishing - maybe its just the rig but some of it feels off to me.  Here is what stands out to me at a glance:   (0:18) During the rearing I think the timing of the front legs and their movement is too slow, it feels unnatural.   -(0:23) I think you could afford to use some offset by a few frames on contact when the legs come down, as it is now it feels awkward because of the twinning,    (0:30) There appears to be way to much overlap on the legs, I don't think they would bend that far up on such an idle animation.  Additionally the wings don't feel like they are supported by any bones or muscle and appear to be rubber affected by the movement of the animal instead of the driving force behind its flying.   Otherwise I think this is exactly the type of thing a game studio would want to see. Not only does it show your animation skills in context of a game and a specific scenario but it shows you have an a good sense of the process. Did you design, model, rig and animate? Definitely a plus."

Thats not something valve appears to care about but a lot of people put couriers of land animals held up by things like balloons to skip animating it, it seems"
animation,379sy8,mjwhiting,6,Tue May 26 01:07:59 2015 UTC,Super cool! Quick questions: was this all done in Maya? How did you achieve that cool atmospheric perspective look?
animation,379sy8,martinluthercow,6,Tue May 26 06:15:43 2015 UTC,"Thank you!  All of the animation was done in Maya (rendered in Renderman RIS), but post-process compositing was done mostly in Nuke… all of the grading/color there gives it most of the final look.  My shots were heavily divided into foreground, middleground, background as well as RGB mattes and Depth call-outs so that I could heavily composite the final image and tweak all of the grading on the film.  A few shots used AfterEffects instead of Nuke, but for the same purpose.  If you're curious on the breakup - I think a bit of it is on my vimeo under my older lighting/compositing reel.  EDIT: for clarification, the middle of my film is actually rendered in Maya software.  The middle of the film had about a 4-layer deep composite which involved layering a fake shadow shader (facing ratio plugged into a v-coord on a lambert), and a fake rim.  Then, I layered on a bunch of extra effects in composite and post. :)"
animation,379sy8,vgsgpz,2,Tue May 26 07:00:55 2015 UTC,how long did it take to finish?
animation,379sy8,martinluthercow,5,Tue May 26 07:45:34 2015 UTC,"About 10 weeks on story/concept art.  Then I spent about 2 weeks on models, 4 weeks on rigging/layout, and 8 weeks on animation.  After animation was wrapped, I had about 10 weeks for lighting/compositing/rendering and final polish.  In total it was me working on it for most of my senior school year, and it is a required part of the curriculum for graduation.  I'm now working in 2D concept art for mobile games and taking a break from 3D art for awhile."

Only the beginning and ending was rendered in Renderman."

I definitely wouldnt say mental ray was more complex than renderman either. Have you used both?

animation,379sy8,sabretewth,1 point,Tue May 26 11:32:24 2015 UTC,"Thanks!  I'm trying to figure out the whole festival route now... Which ones to enter, if it's worth the $$$ (some of them are nearly $50+ to enter.)  Besides publicity, is there any really big reasons for going the festival route with the film?"
animation,379sy8,lonahjogue,2,Tue May 26 16:17:43 2015 UTC,"There's publicity and then there is publicity. Posting it on the internet for people to enjoy is great, but 99.9% of the people who see it are consumers. Festivals on the other hand are attended by people really interested in animation.  So you have you ask yourself, is it worth a few a few bucks to put your work in front of people who care about animation outside your school? It might be worth striking while the iron is hot, instead of waiting a year or two, and then only being able to get your film into the East-Austrian festival of animation and cheese."
animation,379sy8,insufferable_editor,1 point,Tue May 26 17:02:31 2015 UTC,Great advice… went ahead and entered it into as many festivals and I'll keep adding to that list.  Fingers crossed :)
animation,379sy8,opawesome420,2,Wed May 27 15:29:08 2015 UTC,"Everything looks good, but animation can be worked out further, a bit of weight on the character is missing. Also, a detail about eyes - eyebrows seem to remain still in close-ups.    Other than that, looks good, with a nice character design."
animation,37dpxo,dustydiamond,2,Tue May 26 21:48:26 2015 UTC,"Probably something with Flash.  Most Ebooks to my knowledge are in PDF format, which wouldn't support animation.  But if you wanted to host it on a website you could do it in flash with some simple programming."
animation,37dpxo,madafaku,2,Wed May 27 01:36:30 2015 UTC,"only other thing I can think would be much less interactive.  but just have a good voice actor read the story with some simple minimalist animation of the illustration.. like reading rainbow used to do.  and post it on youtube... but flash is probably your best bet.  I'd say you may be able to find someone willing to do this for very cheap or even free ,since its a good cause, on the message board on diviant art.    Or message me if you want, Some people in the frederator network may want to do this for you, at the very least wouldn't hurt to ask."

animation,37dpxo,frank_mauro,2,Wed May 27 01:44:10 2015 UTC,no problem
animation,37dpxo,frank_mauro,2,Wed May 27 01:51:02 2015 UTC,I guess flash is a good tool to make an interactive e-book. that can run on website but now these days as browser need to have flash player to play flash render files. you can go for html5 version of e-book that can play on any format even on iPad or iPhone. Apple do have problem with Flash so I would recommend go for html5. Hope it will help.
animation,37dpxo,Dark_Souls,1 point,Wed May 27 06:00:17 2015 UTC,Thanks! I have to admit my knowledge of this is very limited so I'm still confused...sorry! Is the following correct- If I find someone that can create using html5 the illustrations would be interactive and the story could be viewed using all devices? I really appreciate your help!
