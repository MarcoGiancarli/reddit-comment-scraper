Usually new champions aren't added to the 2 * crystal, but these three were already given 2 * versions during the Ultron event. I don't think the Daily Crystal's roster has been updated since I started playing months ago.

ContestOfChampions,3e3dxe,Alamojunkie,2,Tue Jul 21 17:26:18 2015 UTC,You should consider starting over. Take advantage of your newbie bracket to build a good collection of 3 star champions.  If you continue you are in the intermediate bracket with very little chance of ever winning a arena.
ContestOfChampions,3e3dxe,Nerkata,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:51:08 2015 UTC,"I hate thinking of starting over, but I feel like this is where I'm stuck. I got a 3* Dr. Strange and Magneto my first week, and nothing since. I really had no clue what I was doing and didn't really play in events and burned through a lot of units. I've loaded up on 2* since and don't have a chance at getting 3* in arenas. I'm level 24, and team rating of under 6000. I need Rank 2500 in current arena to get 3* ant man, and I really don't see that hapenning.  Should I think about it? I started playing 5 weeks ago."
ContestOfChampions,3e3dxe,SilverFear,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:24:18 2015 UTC,You should definitely think about it. Ideally you start over now to build up a roster of 4-5 champions to compete in the next arena. Even if you just reach the first couple of milestones you can do the Cornucopia on Sunday and then attack the 7 following noob bracket arenas.  That scores you a LOT of premium crystals ans at least 2-3 new 3s. I did the same and my roster has 10 3 and 27 2* champions without spending a dime. I'm playing for 4 weeks now and I feel confident to compete in the intermediate bracket.

I think that, instead of giving a recall to every player per map, which turns out to be a lot, they could simply have a shared Recall pera Battlegroup/map.

I haven't leveled up my 2* chars yet because I'm still pretty new, but it is much easier to make it past the 15 wins if your characters are upgraded, yes? And I know after 15 the AI gets stronger but is it easier to maintain the streak than at the high PIs? I have gotten to 15 win streak and lost on that, only winning one match. I was also just curious why you don't move winter soldier to face abomination for the class bonus. Can't be bothered to switch them around?  My other question was why did it seem like you were the most outmatched in PI in the first match (10 wins) and then the others were more even?"
ContestOfChampions,3e0ugo,chaddaddycwizzie,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:14:47 2015 UTC,"I make the videos by screen capping my phone, then loading the video into sony Vegas and doing the commentary afterward. My wife has a channel with something like 100 videos, so I bug her for help if I get stuck :).  Keeping a streak is easier if you have leveled characters for sure. When I first started playing, I focused on getting 6 teams to 3/1, then gradually added more. Having the L3 is a huge advantage.   I'm not sure why I didn't move the winter soldier. Could have just been a brain fart.  I'm not sure why fight 11 had such high PI's, I just kinda go with it. If you're facing a matchup like that, you can always boost if you need to."
ContestOfChampions,3e0ugo,Lealdini,0,Tue Jul 21 03:26:18 2015 UTC,Thanks for those tips. Storm-iron fist- and black panther has been my favorite team I've been using since I started doing arenas too so I will probably try to level all of them first.

ContestOfChampions,3e0ugo,Omept,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:16:51 2015 UTC,"To all you beginners, the easiest and most consistent way to get past 15 wins is to have TWO 4* fighters ranked 3/30. You will then be able to fairly easily defeat most 4* duped 3/30, 4/40 and with some skill 5/50.  If you don't, it's not to say you can't get past 15, it's just that it will come down to if you get favorable match ups."

In my experience you also really don't need two 3/30 4*s, I can get to 15 without much trouble using 2 champs of ~1100 PI and a low one (<400). From 15-20 I usually need bigger guys, but ~1500 each is enough to get the easy opponents, after that, everything above 1000/champ seems to work for me."

Electro works better against stuff like Doctor Strange, where you really need to burst it down.  I'm going with Ant-Man first, but that is in large part because I""m trying to dupe him in the arena. Duped Ant-Man vs. unduped Electro isn't close. AM's signature is just really good."
ContestOfChampions,3e0e81,Moshne,3,Tue Jul 21 00:24:37 2015 UTC,"Personally, I'd go for Ant-Man because I really like his stacking poison. Also, his signature ability will be fantastic if you dupe him in this arena. Electro, however, does have more to offer: stun, a good critical rate, and Static Shock. Fortunately, he has amazing damage, but unfortunately, his health is low, making him a glass cannon. Ant-Man, however, seems to have a pretty balanced ratio of health/attack. I currently have a maxed, duped three star Electro and a duped rank 1 level 10 Ant-Man. While Electro is definitely a great champion and one of the heaviest hitters in the game, I find Ant-Man just a lot of fun to play with. It's nice to get 5 poisons on your enemy at once. Not to mention his cool new special attack animations and his victory pose is actually pretty funny."

ContestOfChampions,3e01l9,knightzeemo,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:56:15 2015 UTC,U need at least 300k to 400k in intermediate bracket.  Here is some tips -  1) You gonna need many rank 3 level 1 team. Bunch of em. Gives you higher points and make it easier to get to the infinite streak.  2) Use the best combo possible when attacking  Slide right-tap-tap-tap-slide right for max dmg.  3) Dont put your hopes on PCs their odds is just terrible.  4) For me its better to saves 400 units for a confirmed 3star crystal.

Having opened 15 premium crystals, you right where you should be.  It's going to be hard to compete in the arena with only 4 teams, but at least hit the milestones for now.  Do the quests, you will get units for completing each quest, and then again for exploring (100%) each quest. You can spend those units on crystals. The game will also give you 3* or 4* crystals as you 100% Act 1,2,3."

The only 4 stars I ever got was from finishing the Quests and from saving up 2,500 units, and I suspect it will stay this way for a long time still, I've been playing since January and have opened in excess of about 300 premium crystals.  My best advice, like a lot of people are saying is to play the arena's but also just do the quest to 100%, you will get 3 star crystals from that, building your 3 star team takes a lot of time, or money but is definitely possible without the latter.  Good luck!"

Once you get a good player rating, find a really strong alliance and just work with them and you'll end up getting a bunch more pc's. The good thing about working harder on the quests than the arena is that you eventually get 3* crystals and pc's and stuff for completing those."

To earn the character being offered in an arena, you have to rank high enough. I believe the minimum points for you would have been 300k. Ant-Man story quests will be released twice a week: One on Tuesday, the next on Friday. Unknown. It is possible to be the next arena, seeing as there are no playable characters in the game that aren't/haven't been obtainable as a four star in any way (Black Bolt was the last one), so they'd have to move on to new characters. However, they also promised Elektra and War Machine with this update, so we'll have to wait and see."

Without knowing...most people just sit around with their thumbs up their bums.    On that note, Kabam should also actually display who is doing what in an Alliance instead of saying ""an Alliance member opened a crystal"".

Unless of course they have noticed a marked increase in crystal purchases during these events.
ContestOfChampions,3dz6h5,Voltaire325,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:32:23 2015 UTC,I think the events were designed in a way that forces people to horde the crystals.  I don't think there is anyway for an Alliance to hit the milestones if people don't horde and open on the day of that event.
ContestOfChampions,3dz6h5,icknaybob,3,Mon Jul 20 21:22:41 2015 UTC,I'd like if they told us the scores after the events.

It's supposed to drive people to play more as they never know where they are and can never see if they are in a safe spot to stop playing an event.   Also I'm not sure about Injustice but Marvel can't be played offline so if there are hackers they will be caught quickly and they wouldn't be able to hack their way though maybe more than one event. This is something that Kabam has talked about on their forums whenever someone posts a video of them 'hacking' the game."
ContestOfChampions,3dz6h5,SirMonkeyWaffles,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:56:55 2015 UTC,"Valid response, but does a dark leaderboard really drive people to spend more?  That seems unlikely.  People are just as likely to spend money to get a few more points than they are to give up b/c they're too far out.    Also other than Kabam saying so, what proof do we have that they are catching hackers?  There are certainly no shortage of websites offering to sell hacks to this game.  I just don't believe Kabam.   By keeping the leaderboard dark, all they're doing is hiding what's really going on.  Everyone can do as they please, but until Kabam is transparent about what is going on, they're not getting any more of my $$$."
ContestOfChampions,3dz6h5,SirMonkeyWaffles,3,Mon Jul 20 19:20:24 2015 UTC,Your right about us not knowing about hackers unless they tell us.   As for the Dark leader boards I don't like them because of the fact they force you to spend. If your nervous about placing at all you're going to spend all your time/units on grinding. Which is not something I have the time for.

ContestOfChampions,3dz6h5,DhamonGrimwulf,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:31:46 2015 UTC,Your point would be valid if Kabam EVER listed the scores from events.  The fact that the scores are kept secret (even after the evnts end) leaves little doubt that Kabam is keeping the leaderboard dark to prevent players from being discouraged by hackers who are taking up the majority of the top spots at every event.
ContestOfChampions,3dz6h5,HungerGamesDJ,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:01:47 2015 UTC,"It is still valid. I'm not saying they also don't think they want to keep scores dark, but it's evidently clear they have problems scoring players, it takes ages to get everything sorted. If they were capable of sorting the scores in, at least, near real time, you would get your scores earlier.

If you're active in Arenas you can gain a lot of gold; I average around 50K in gold for a 3 day event and I don't grind them like some people do.   If you're in an Alliance take part in events and get the XP boost item. I use these while I'm running catalyst quests and it helps level up quite a bit.

ContestOfChampions,3dxvd6,chrisbroncos76,4,Mon Jul 20 13:02:30 2015 UTC,"No, it doesn't actually give you evade. Its only feature is a crit rate boost on your next attack whenever you dodge an attack by swiping."

ContestOfChampions,3dxvd6,chrisbroncos76,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:02:56 2015 UTC,"You seem to have answered yourself =) Plus, it becomes an alternative to Block, as I mentioned before.  When you start facing the aggressive AI, you'll understand that dodging fails a lot more than you'd wish.  Dexterity also allows you to Dodge specials that were undodgeable before, only defensible, like long range abilities (Thor's hammer, cap's shield, spiderman's webs) and mid-range skills that 1 dodge would not be sufficient to gain distance, such as Visions L1 or IronMan's L2."

ContestOfChampions,3dx3bx,TheSnowNinja,1 point,Mon Jul 20 08:37:00 2015 UTC,I've played since January. I have never gotten a 4* from an arena. I also have never gotten one from premium crystals. My only 4* came from using 2500 units on a 4* crystal. Took a while to save up that many units.
ContestOfChampions,3dx3bx,chrisbroncos76,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:54:19 2015 UTC,About 0.1%
ContestOfChampions,3dx3bx,esteban42,1 point,Mon Jul 20 12:54:18 2015 UTC,"I honestly don't think it's as random as they want you to believe... I didn't play for about three months (broke my smartphone), and when I came back I got a 4* and three 3*, plus a dupe of one of the 3s within a week of coming back. Since then (about 6-8 weeks), I've gotten one 3* that wasn't from a 3* crystal and no 4*s.  Also, I feel like they weight the champions you already have. I had several of my champs duped 5-6 times before I got the full set of 2*s. (well, technically I'm still missing Punisher 2*, but he's only available in versus crystals)"
ContestOfChampions,3dx3bx,DhamonGrimwulf,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:17:19 2015 UTC,"oh, sigh, conspiracy theorists. It's random. You have all kinds of examples: People who came back, got nothing, went away again, people like you, people like a guy in my Alliance which has the luckiest of lucks with getting 4-stars, people like me that get a 4 here and there, people that are still to get their first four star...."
ContestOfChampions,3dx3bx,Thekobra,2,Mon Jul 20 18:55:43 2015 UTC,"I'd say that your lucky you started after the introduction of the newbie arenas so you could get those 4, 4* champs early on.   Competing in arenas definitely does not impact your crystal odds. My entire alliance are players who go hard in the arenas and some have been very lucky with crystals, while others have been very unlucky. The thing is that 4* pulls from any crystal is extremely rare. I estimate it's around 0.5% chance. The leader of my alliance plays a ton, gets a lot of crystals, but hasn't opened a 4* in months. On the flip side, one of our officers who also plays a ton recently had a lucky streak where he opened like 5-6 over the course of about two weeks.   Personally, I've been playing since February and I've open 5 4*s in that time, but none in the first 3.5 months of playing.   The odds are awful, but luckily it's easy to earn a lot crystals each week without spending money to get them. Keep at it and you'll eventually get lucky."

ContestOfChampions,3dwzu2,brrrttt,1 point,Mon Jul 20 06:03:16 2015 UTC,"Yeah they were, but I'm not sure anyone has got one of them just yet. They're in some alliance quests, depending on your alliance's prestige rating.   Some people welcome the idea of 5* as it means the game is extended - then there are those that think it's a bit of a strange call and introduction - kinda like 4* is the new 3*."
ContestOfChampions,3dwzu2,brrrttt,-1,Mon Jul 20 06:53:31 2015 UTC,"Reading up on it, holy shit.  4 Stars should've been the playable cutoff. I can understand final boss being 5 stars, but no regular player should have that power.  If 5 stars can severely damage a blocking 4 star then why is it in the game? Should've keep it at 4 stars."
ContestOfChampions,3dwzu2,DhamonGrimwulf,2,Mon Jul 20 07:07:25 2015 UTC,"Yeah, agreed. I was on the Kabam forums a while ago and some guy from one of the top alliances said he'd spent $12k on the game. Now that's a bit mental, but if you have that kind of cash lying around, then go for it. But now all that money spent means a lot less to him.  Kabam go on about how it isn't a ""pay to win"" game - which is true to a degree. But it's pretty much guaranteed that the top players win and have duped 4* champs because they've paid. And the 5* just means more money and winning for them imo."
ContestOfChampions,3dwzu2,TheCobaltEffect,0,Mon Jul 20 23:58:28 2015 UTC,"Well, with the new Dexterity Mastery, you can completely eliminate all damage. I can now win a lot more fights! lol  edit: with a lot more fights, I meant those fights were the opponent is at least twice your PI, of course"
ContestOfChampions,3dwzu2,DhamonGrimwulf,1 point,Mon Jul 20 08:38:23 2015 UTC,"About that. I have dexterity maxed and I noticed it only seems to actually evade attacks I would have evaded without it. Like a traveling special attack, I can ""evade"" and still be hit. Even quick ones like iron man or storms L2.  A lot of times I get the ""evade"" text but I still get hit like regular... is this a bug perhaps, or is it intended?"
ContestOfChampions,3dwzu2,TheCobaltEffect,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:38:37 2015 UTC,"It's either a bug, or maybe you're just not using it right. I can evade everything.  This is a useful skill for the aggressive AI - if you're not at that level, it won't be as useful for you.  Basically, when you dodge, there is a chance the enemy may still hit you if he's fast enough - either with a regular attack (you were just too slow at dodging), or by going after you with a swipe of himself, which will always hit you.  Regarding Specials, the ones that are trickier to 'dodge' are Diagonal specials, like Vision's L1 or IronMan's L2, where if you dodged, you would still get hit by them, because you were still in range. With Dexterity, you Evade all of the above, instead of getting hit.  Regarding Specials, you have to take notice that the evade is only active while you're moving. Once the character stops, you no longer evade. So while you can easily evade stuff like Thor's Hammer or the Cap's Shield, Spiderman's Webs are trickier - you must either evade several times or evade and then defend.  The greatest thing about Dexterity, is that it allows you to 100% avoid damage - guaranteed, while that is not true with Defense (unless you get a perfect block, but it's not guaranteed).  edit: Also, having extra levels of Dexterity does not grant you 'more evade', like you seemed to alude to. Evade is 100% guaranteed when you properly use it. The extra levels are for extra crit."
ContestOfChampions,3dwzu2,DhamonGrimwulf,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:55:39 2015 UTC,"I know they are for crit, and right now that's all it's good for. Perhaps it is a bug because the first day I got it I felt like it did evade everything.  Now I can't even evade oncoming attacks sometimes unless it looked like I already would dodge it (without the passive). They are hitting me like normal except ""evade"" pops up and I get the crit bonus.  No matter how I try on specials too I get hit even though ""evade"" pops up. Hawkeye, storm, cap, thor.. all of em, the move still actually hits me if the source of damage comes in contact with my still moving character."

ContestOfChampions,3dutaf,LegoBobaFett,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:27:37 2015 UTC,Actually not accurate. The cutoff was around 2.5 million   I squeaked into 940th place with 2.1 million - couple in my alliance placed in top 100
ContestOfChampions,3dutaf,FarterTed,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:48:00 2015 UTC,What bracket are you in? That doesn't sound right. I had people in my alliance with 2.3 mil who BARELY made the 3*. Unless there was a huge amount of people just slightly above 2.3 mil I don't believe it.
ContestOfChampions,3dutaf,kjromine,1 point,Mon Jul 20 05:03:38 2015 UTC,Veteran and I'm speaking the truth. If u really doubt my veracity I will get a screenshot and post it  Why would I lie about it???
ContestOfChampions,3dutaf,FarterTed,1 point,Mon Jul 20 11:57:18 2015 UTC,"Even with the old system it's not possible to achieve 3.4 without spending units (unless you have several teams of 4 star 5/50 who score much more points then 4 star 3/30 or 3 star 4/40) There will always be spenders in the 4* arena, granted it's only about 600-800 units as opposed to 2500 units for a random 4 star"
ContestOfChampions,3dutaf,dagibcollecta,2,Wed Jul 22 00:28:25 2015 UTC,"Kabam was not thinking ahead when they thought they would reduce the grinding by the pym canisters method because they gave enough pyms for someone who is used to grind like hell to play as much to get to the points they ve previously got. I got to 400 k and thought that was enough and didn't get it. I m gonna quit grinding cause i think there will always be >12.500 people out there that have not yet realized rthis gameis killing their life. In short, if they wanted to reduce the grinding they had to limit the amount of pym canisters or they would have to set a 35 match maximum per day type of limit so people could not take the ranks too high."
ContestOfChampions,3dutaf,Zik1903erten,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:17:30 2015 UTC,Stopped at 400k too hoping the cutoffs would be lower. Well that turned out to be a waste of time.
ContestOfChampions,3dutaf,juuubart,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:20:39 2015 UTC,"Not really, only for people who were doing both arenas for milestones who then had to choose. Can't see my placing yet but me and my alliance members ended up grinding the same for the 3*."
ContestOfChampions,3dutaf,noamto,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:24:23 2015 UTC,"I assume you didn't do the 4* at all as a result of the canisters, so it forced you to choose? Previously did you try and do both?"
ContestOfChampions,3dutaf,JDsInnerMonologue,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:33:35 2015 UTC,I only went for the 3* this time where I usually enter both arenas.
ContestOfChampions,3dutaf,noamto,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:53:16 2015 UTC,Before the Black Bolt arenas I would grind the 3* and do the 4* only for some of the milestones when I could. In the Black Bolt arena I tried to go for the Hawkeye milestone so I did just a little bit of the 3* arena also for the milestones. This time I just did the 3* because I knew I wouldn't have enough canisters for both.
ContestOfChampions,3dutaf,y2j_lionsault,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:45:47 2015 UTC,"I did the same. I'd grind milestones in one, rank in the other. Had to make a choice. But I think I was probably more diligent in hitting my resets as they came up, so I'm not sure I actually played any less."
ContestOfChampions,3dutaf,soccorsticks,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:51:38 2015 UTC,"Cut offs got lower but not significantly 530k got me in rank 110 in intermediate, in the past BB Arenas that amount placed me in rank 166 and 160. This experiment filtered out people who weren't in strong alliances or that didn't had time to farm. My wonderful alliance got all the canisters from the events along with the Alpha so I had my normal share of matches. I'd call this a failure, a mistake, in resume a total fiasco and I hope Kabam never implements it again."
ContestOfChampions,3dutaf,soccorsticks,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:43:00 2015 UTC,It didn't for me. 510k in 100 matches. Still have plenty of pym left. No idea what my rank will be but thats been more than enough in the past.   I wish they would have limited the amount pym you could get. With all the crying about farming I doubt 12500 people were going to waste time farming when you might get one canister per run.   Btw how may points did you get in the newbie 4* bracket?
ContestOfChampions,3dutaf,joshualeet,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:49:02 2015 UTC,"1.1 million. Somehow I edited that out when I was reading over my post. In previous arenas, that has been about the point for 40th. I got 49th place in Iron Patriot with 1.06m."

ContestOfChampions,3dutaf,Afiq3688,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:29:12 2015 UTC,I got rank 5195 in vet 3 star with 595k points
ContestOfChampions,3dutaf,Ghostman_Loon,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:32:42 2015 UTC,"Considering the last time I played to win a character was when cutoffs were only at 300k(The Vision from Age of Ultron), this wasn't much of a reduction in grinding. I went to 509k and got rank 10k. I was expecting myself to be at about 5k or so, so that was surprising. I heard the last cutoffs were around 600k though so I shouldn't complain lol"
ContestOfChampions,3dutaf,Voltaire325,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:40:46 2015 UTC,You are in the veteran bracket I presume.  If that is so then he was lower than Magneto and Iron Patriot.

ContestOfChampions,3dutaf,Prospect1979,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:25:01 2015 UTC,The cutoff for a 3* in the vet bracket was below 500k. That is a definite reduction for a new character.  So it helped a bit.  Are they going to bring back the 450k milestone for an old character next week?
ContestOfChampions,3dutaf,dagibcollecta,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:40:26 2015 UTC,people were grinding 4* arena because of alpha catalyst thats why it dropped

I always start getting overly hard matchups after 10...  3) I'm interested in seeing that boss fight video you mentioned.

ContestOfChampions,3dr330,barbenatiya,-3,Sat Jul 18 17:18:23 2015 UTC,there arent more rewards 2. there is same amount of grinding + you have to spend more money if you want 4star (not possible to get without money)
ContestOfChampions,3dr330,sodapoppin420,3,Sat Jul 18 20:51:15 2015 UTC,Milestones are easier now.
ContestOfChampions,3dr330,Bigjacksblackbook,2,Sat Jul 18 23:46:42 2015 UTC,"Remains to be seen. Yes, it is nice for hitting milestones. It may end up creating a paywall for hitting rank rewards though. In the Newbie bracket, I've hit 800k after using all my canisters in the 4* arena. That wasn't nearly enough to get a 4* in previous newbie arenas."
ContestOfChampions,3dr330,Moshne,2,Sat Jul 18 17:23:48 2015 UTC,"I think it might be enough, if your alliance has gotten all the possible canisters from events. I'm sure there will be many in the newbie bracket whose alliances aren't good enough to do that."

ContestOfChampions,3dr330,turkeyjr,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:06:44 2015 UTC,I never once complained about the pylls. I was using refills to grind them so I would have an advantage once the arena actually released. I was excited about having a limited arena.
ContestOfChampions,3dr330,chaddaddycwizzie,0,Mon Jul 20 21:48:47 2015 UTC,Everyone is an exaggeration. I'm just explaining why kabam  probably felt the need to make them more available.

ContestOfChampions,3dr330,sombrerofrog,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:46:47 2015 UTC,My plan was to play the 3 * arena until I ran out of Pym cannisters and now I have so many from alliance events and Kabam's gifts for likes that I'm going to have leftovers. Hopefully people are trying to get all the milestone awards from both arenas since that's more doable now and the 3 * Ant Man cutoff will be low.
ContestOfChampions,3dr330,cmay91472,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:43:57 2015 UTC,"Way underestimating cutoffs. The only thing the cans will affect is the difference between those that are above the cutoff and those below.

ContestOfChampions,3dr330,Ghostman_Loon,3,Sat Jul 18 20:19:51 2015 UTC,"True, it does suck for people in small alliances that don't reach milestones. But for people like me in at least mid-tier alliances who don't care to spend the time/effort to win champs in arenas anymore, it's great."
ContestOfChampions,3dr330,zetus_lapetus,0,Sat Jul 18 20:55:18 2015 UTC,New players and weak alliances aren't the ones getting the rank rewards anyways. The milestones were all cut in half for you making them much more reachable. You should have like 50 pym cannisters just from the antman quest. Which is enough to hit all the milestones in the 3* arena and then some.
ContestOfChampions,3dr330,Ghostman_Loon,1 point,Sat Jul 18 21:39:08 2015 UTC,"Rubbish. My last alliance was complete gash, but I ranked top 20 in last 4 events.  If I hadn't swapped alliances I would not have got anywhere due to lack of cans."

ContestOfChampions,3dso19,Afiq3688,2,Sun Jul 19 02:02:02 2015 UTC,"In all likelihood, yes. There are still pym cannisters to be earned throughout the Antman quest. Based on the rate they have been releasing the Antman Quest, we can assume we will still be playing it, and collecting Pym Cannisters after the Antman Arena is over (4 days from now). There is not much reason to keep awarding Pym Cannisters after the Antman Arena, if they weren't going to allow you to use them, in what will presumably be the Yellow Jacket Arena afterwards."

I noticed a bit of graphical stutter and lag before it crashes and it's after the game has been running for a while. All the symptoms of a memory hole, pretty common bug when games/programs are updated. Older devices have less RAM, so they crash more frequently. Hopefully it gets fixed soon."

ContestOfChampions,3dqlgl,thedukeoftank,2,Sat Jul 18 14:27:41 2015 UTC,"I believe that these two combinations would GREATLY improve the Alliance Arenas and help the players who can't play as much as some get a decent share of the rewards.   This is a sentiment I don't quite understand... Why would you expect to get a as you say `decent share' of rewards if you don't play much. The arena part of the game is competitive, which means you get rewards based on how much you invest (time / money / planning).   In terms of your proposals, lower gold is good, old costs were kind of crazy. Making brackets based on alliance power is bad I think. It rewards alliances for staying small. The ""balancing"" part of arenas should be with the milestones and reasonable rank-rewards. That is, there should be something obtainable from rank rewards for smaller alliances as well. So not only the top 100 gets something useful for example."
ContestOfChampions,3dqlgl,Obliwan,3,Sun Jul 19 00:14:51 2015 UTC,"Bro,with my old account i ve posted several comments with a ""the players who do not play much do not deserve anything"" type of opinion but with the AQ s i realized that people who work cannot play this game for hours in their worktime and it s really unfair for them and this would make kabam uncaring anout most of his players. I still think more effort should give more gain but maybe that can be done with placing even better rewards for the high ranks and or including more rank rewards"
ContestOfChampions,3dqlgl,Zik1903erten,2,Sun Jul 19 00:44:30 2015 UTC,"Well, my points is mainly that the arena is the competitive part of the game and that should stay that way. Ideally, it might be nice to have a non-competitive type system where you can also earn new 3* and 4*, but it would just take longer. For example, some special open arena, where you just gather points until you have enough for a reward (as in, you can take however long you need to get to the number of points).  But the arena itself, should remain with more or less the same idea as it is now, I kind of like it. Though I hope the milestone champs come back."

Normally it's like first five matches real easy, then at winstreak 8 you get thrown a curve ball, then it's easy sailing from there up till 20-25. Somewhere between 23-26 I would always get some tough matches: you know the kind where it's impossible to win all three fights. You just have to settle for 2 wins. And then it would be all easy from there on down.   But...at the ant-man arena (I only play the 3* arena, since my roster of 3* champs is too small) it's all over the place. Last time I got a surprise at winstreak 3! Right of the bat, first fight impossible to win, the next two fights were easy so kept my winstreak, but I was completely surprised by getting one of those matchups that early on in a winstreak"

ContestOfChampions,3do0vk,phliuy,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:09:25 2015 UTC,"agreed, when you see it take UC's 3 bar red down to nothing you know you just won the match."
ContestOfChampions,3do0vk,grathan,-2,Fri Jul 17 21:27:27 2015 UTC,"I don't even have a vision that can use L2 (only got 1 star) so really I'm basing it off of fighting against them. I'll take a match against vision any day, especially with a longer streak going when he has much higher PI if I see vision I know I have a chance. His L1 is super easy to anticipate and if he does actually save up to L2 that's even better because it doesn't even have range past right in front of him, which means you have to use it after or during a combo (as opposed to Cyclops, punisher etc that can hit from anywhere). Then they also have to not be blocking for it to be effective. Then if it is effective it's really not that powerful, just takes away some energy, which I guess can be useful if you can land one on an opponent, and they are in red and it takes them out of it. You still then have to bait them into L2 which you could have done before they got red as easily as you can in this situation"
ContestOfChampions,3do0vk,phliuy,2,Fri Jul 17 22:00:12 2015 UTC,"Most of your points are extremely flawed in one way or another.   Range: almost literally every champion's L2 range is limited. Even for those that aren't, the long range blast has a multiple hit windup, which means it's even more easily blocked. If you can hit the, with the last blast of cyclop's L2, that means the AI didn't bother blocking it, which means you're on a shit AI anyway. It also means that you will only hit them with 50% of your special's power.   ""It's not powerful if it's blocked"". No shit. No ones special isomer full is blocked. What a horrible reason.   ""It's not that powerful"": it 1) takes away their special which is extremely important for controlling the match. 2) it does damage based on the power taken away. A 3 star vision can do 1500 freaking damage when it lands, in addition to burning their entire power bar.  All of your arguments are flawed because you don't actually have a vision that can L2. That means you probably shouldn't be talking about it. Since you clearly have never used him, you shouldn't pass judgement. Of its terrible with the AI. So is hawkeye's L1, and that's one of the best in the game.  TL;DR: your reasoning doesn't distinguish vision's L2 from anyone else's, and don't judge what you haven't used"
ContestOfChampions,3do0vk,phliuy,-2,Fri Jul 17 22:36:48 2015 UTC,"Take a chill pill dude. Nowhere did I make a point of it not being powerful if blocked. I said it's not powerful,  as in doesn't do a lot of damage even if it is NOT blocked. I have lost all my energy from the move fighting vision before but I forgot he did that so when it does that yeah that's pretty solid, not gonna lie. You act like you have to play as them to have any say in judging a character, how are moves any different if they are you using them or AI? Obviously AI is less effective, but I was just judging based off of the most effective scenarios"
ContestOfChampions,3do0vk,phliuy,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:46:55 2015 UTC,"""They also have to be not blocking for it to be effective""  This means that if it was blocked, it would not be effective. Another word for effective in this game is powerful. If you're going to nitpick synonyms you have zero merit in your argument.   ""It doesn't do a lot of damage even if it is NOT blocked""  That's just wrong. Of you actually read through my post instead of trying to pick at individual parts, you'd read that it does 1500 damage when it fully burns the special. 1500 isn't a lot to you? Bullshit.   A character is always better in a person's hands because they can exploit their powers. An AI vision will often use an L2 while you have very little power, meaning it won't much damage. As a human, you can wait until they have more power to use it. An AI will also use it while you're blocking, because it's just coded to use it the same way everyone else uses their L2, so it's wasted.   And finally, you're just not acknowledging the stupidity of your other points.   As a final unrelated note, when someone disagrees with you, it doesn't automatically mean they're upset, angry, or rattled. It just means they're disagreeing with you. So no, I do need to ""take a chill pill"". If you equate disagreement to anger, I really don't know what to tell you. That's pretty juvenile."
ContestOfChampions,3do0vk,phliuy,-2,Fri Jul 17 23:11:07 2015 UTC,"You are taking everything I said out of context. That sentence wasn't supposed to stand alone it was supposed to be just one segment that illustrates how many different criteria have to go right to land it, and even when you do I felt like it wasn't worth it considering everything that has to go right. Yes a blocked L2 not being effective applies to everyone but that's not the point I was making with that. I didn't think you were angry just because you disagree, I thought you were angry because you clearly seemed offended that I would go as far as to suggest that Vision isn't the best champ in the game, even going as far as to tell me I have no business judging characters. I'm not saying this move is bad (I said OVERRATED) I'm saying other champs have good moves too and I'm just not buying into every reddit champ circlejerk. You say I don't acknowledge the stupidity but I also never claimed to be a professional I was just posting a thought I had. I also admitted that taking away all the energy is better than I gave it credit for  initially so how am I not acknowledging anything I said was wrong again? And another thing I didn't mention is let's say you have an opportunity to erase their red bar...what if they use their red before you can get your L2 off? gg"
ContestOfChampions,3do0vk,SoggyFrenchFry,2,Sat Jul 18 00:25:57 2015 UTC,"1) yes it was a stand alone comment, it is literally the only thing you say about blocking and its effectiveness.   2) learn to use paragraphs.   3) I never said you had to consider him the best, the only things I said were that all your points were shit.   4) I said you have no business judging characters you never used. Large difference. Do not cherry pick words while cutting off other parts of the sentence vital for the argument.  5) I didn't say you didn't acknowledge anything you said was wrong, just the greater majority.   6) you have no further support for your argument besides nitpicking words.   7) stop arguing what isn't there. I don't say half the things you say I did.   8) make an actual argument about why it's over rated with points that aren't invalid"

I never gave any of your arguments a different meaning. They are the exact same, except in more coherent words.  1) I've never said vision was the best but you put that argument onto me.   2) I never said you have no business judging characters. I said you can't judge without playing with them first.   3) I never said that you didn't acknowledge any comment. Just all of them.  So right there. Three things I never said that you argued anyway.   If you have no further arguments about vision's L2, I'm done. I'm not responding to anymore irrelevant attacks on me or non existent positions.

ContestOfChampions,3dn286,t0talnonsense,3,Fri Jul 17 18:10:04 2015 UTC,"My gripe is that the prizes aren't very good... It's a lot of work, coordination and a bit of stress with differing schedules and then you get gold as a prize... I have enough damn gold!"
ContestOfChampions,3dn286,BAzzyBaby,2,Fri Jul 17 17:25:59 2015 UTC,"They've already said that the prixes are scaled down for the testing period, because they don't want us to have an overly large advantage through rewards.

ContestOfChampions,3dn286,UnlimitedOsprey,4,Fri Jul 17 18:22:56 2015 UTC,We just finished the 2nd map all 3 battle groups at 100% and I have no clue how we are going to do the same for the next map with the difficulty ramped up. The cost of health potions is completely insane for what we are going up against. I had to use units to finish off a path that nobody else could get to in time so that ultron could be taken down. My alliance crystal reward was one paltry lowest end health potion and I see that our next reward at rank 6 for 2.5 million is two of the 1200 heals yet rank 8 for 3.5 million is ONLY ONE of the same 1200 heals. The rewards for ranked are also a joke to me. Other than the alpha for top 100 the tier 3 basic cat all the rewards could be gotten with minimal effort doing dailies.  It's a great idea and a lot of fun working together but it needs MAJOR changes to be of any interest.
ContestOfChampions,3dn286,VeronicaLowe,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:27:19 2015 UTC,"its testing, the rewards will be better when it rolls out for everyone.  you don't have to finish.  it's ok not to spend units on testing."
ContestOfChampions,3dn286,UnlimitedOsprey,2,Fri Jul 17 17:31:22 2015 UTC,If it's testing then why are we spending 700K gold on the 3 maps to test? If they want it tested and lower the rewards then the entrance fee should be much lower.

ContestOfChampions,3dn286,ductyl,3,Fri Jul 17 19:58:11 2015 UTC,You know what I mean. Still doesn't explain the logic of why we're paying gold out the ass to test.
ContestOfChampions,3dn286,t0talnonsense,3,Fri Jul 17 20:02:45 2015 UTC,Other than the weak prizes my biggest issue is losing your top 3 champs for 24 hours. For me that means a harder path for catalysts
ContestOfChampions,3dn286,skcih,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:34:44 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I find myself saving energy so I can do a quick catalyst run between Alliance Quests..."
ContestOfChampions,3dn286,C4NN1B41,3,Fri Jul 17 20:46:24 2015 UTC,"Alright, before I dive into some of my thoughts, everyone needs to remember/realize that the alliance events are all scaled to your ""prestige."" Prestige is a number that is initially derived by the top 3 champs of everyone in your alliance. It then goes up and down based on how well you do in alliance missions. So, theoretically, the alliance events are scaled to give a similar level of difficulty across all brackets of play.  I'm part of a 1mil alliance, and we have completed every map each day of this testing period. We took on quests 1 and 2. We are on quest 3 right now.  While it's possible for all 3 battle groups to complete the maps, it is unnecessarily difficult logistically. The amount of coordination is incredibly high. Without a small number of us spending a couple of hours each day planning and plotting how to proceed, we would never get through the event to 100%. Having a Line chat is almost mandatory. Having people online at the exact right times can be trying. It's summer right now, which means some of our guys have more time than usual, and it's still difficult.  To combat the issue above, there are a few different ways to go about it. Personally, I am partial to these: 2 battle groups at 15 players apiece, slightly smaller maps, a larger energy pool to fill (don't need more starting energy), access to more than 3 champions, fewer paths per section with more champs on them (allows for more diversity of player champions on a given path), making events last 2 days instead of 1.  I think any of the above suggestions would combat the difficulty inherent in the current system from a structural standpoint.   Now, addressing a different problem entirely: items. Either we need to get them from other places than just alliance stuff and units, or we need to be given more when we start out, and their price needs to be nerfed considerably. Right now, they are way too precious to be able to use even somewhat effectively. They tease you more than actually help you. Piggybacking off items is gifting. It sure would be helpful if I could gift someone one of my potions, or be allowed to deposit them into the alliance stash and let another player withdraw them.  We need clarification on how the recall system works. It was there on day one. Then gone on the second day. Haven't checked to see if we have it again today. Regardless, we need to know how it works.  TL;DR: Difficulty needs to be scaled differently. It's harder for logistical reasons than it actually is in difficulty. Splitting ten people up across 5 different, interconnected, paths with limited energy, 3 different times, is a hassle, not ""difficult."" The amount of time out of the game planning is far too high. Alliance items need serious attention."

ContestOfChampions,3dmyuv,SirMonkeyWaffles,2,Fri Jul 17 16:25:52 2015 UTC,"Mostly I don't understand why in hells we don't have a single Recall on the second map (is the third the same??). If they feel 10 Recalls (one per player) is too much, just gives us a couple Global Recalls - I'd say 2~3 would be more than enough for the harder maps."

I just went through my Alliance: We've been keeping the same players on the same Battlegroups on my Alliance, and we observed the following:   Some members used a Recall on the first day: that included me, and at least one other player from my own Battlegroup (so that says Recall is individual and not shared, which is nice). Some members from my Battlegroup did NOT use Recall on the first day, but they saw the button there. After that first day, the Recall Button never appeared ever again.

ContestOfChampions,3dluei,chrisbroncos76,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:21:41 2015 UTC,Totally agree. One really needs to critically think the best strategy with the limited number of canisters.

ContestOfChampions,3dluei,trippynumbers,2,Fri Jul 17 13:23:24 2015 UTC,Hard to turn down those sweet milestone rewards in 4* arena this time.  Plus perfect series benefits greatly from it.

Quality over quantity in the micro realm, I guess"
ContestOfChampions,3dluei,trippynumbers,1 point,Fri Jul 17 13:54:35 2015 UTC,"I very much doubt it's going to be ""half"" the points, they have no control over those numbers. What we do know is that they number of times you can battle in the event are limited by the Pym Canisters, which means they're limited by how much money and grinding (in the Ant-man quest, chests have canisters in them) you're willing to do... so basically just like the regular event, the people who pay money and spend all day grinding will win."
ContestOfChampions,3dluei,ductyl,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:17:11 2015 UTC,"I think the same cutoff applies. I am not really sure though. But I will keep on playing as long as I have Pym Canisters rather than take chances and be contented with the score I gathered. I am focusing on the 2* arena. At least there I have a chance to get an Ant-Man. But I'm aiming to get the milestones in the 3* arena too. Aside from reducing it to half, it awards Pym Canisters on all milestones, as well as the regular rewards."

There is one where you open crystals.  You get a certain amount of points per crystal open.  So if everyone saved their free, event, and quest crystals to open during that event, your alliance members get free goodies. This only works if the entire bloodly alliance saves their crystals!  The ""dupe"" event is the Draw Duplicates"" event in which you open any crystal that can give you a hero.  For every duplicate hero you get, you earn points.

ContestOfChampions,3dkg62,TheRealGRM,5,Fri Jul 17 00:08:52 2015 UTC,open chests in the ant man quests. I won 1 cannister by opening a chest 3*.
ContestOfChampions,3dkg62,bobiel,1 point,Fri Jul 17 09:15:57 2015 UTC,In the second Act of the Antman quests you can get 4 canisters by taking the middle Mystic path while spending 32 energy. It's a lot I know but its guaranteed every time and you also get 2 3* chests.
ContestOfChampions,3dkg62,TheHotterPotato,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:22:47 2015 UTC,"It actually only uses 28 energy up. Very efficient. Refills are 30 units. You are getting between 8-12 pym cans per refill. Most people are burning units by gifting each other pym cans at 10 units a pop,  I much prefer 8 to 12 per 30 units over gifting 3 per 30 units."
ContestOfChampions,3dkg62,cmay91472,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:29:39 2015 UTC,"Ooops, thanks for the correction man! 28 is even better. I had no idea people were paying 10 units a pop for the Pym cans, much easier to just farm our way."
ContestOfChampions,3djk8c,slumpsox,4,Thu Jul 16 20:02:20 2015 UTC,I honestly can't believe you have to pay money to give things away.
ContestOfChampions,3djk8c,BrodieNooch,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:58:13 2015 UTC,"Yeah, you pay to be able to pay to give things away. Because you can't gift things from your inventory.... only things you buy with units!"
ContestOfChampions,3djk8c,Lealdini,2,Thu Jul 16 21:07:31 2015 UTC,But at least you can get units free in game... the only way to get a Gift Badge is by spending actual money.
ContestOfChampions,3djk8c,ductyl,1 point,Fri Jul 17 00:30:53 2015 UTC,"The price is steep, but it keeps players from exploiting the gifting system.  Players would just create a new account and use the free units you start off with to gift things to their main account.  Rise and Repeat."
ContestOfChampions,3djk8c,lvillani81,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:18:32 2015 UTC,This should've been available for people who had bought this previously
ContestOfChampions,3djk8c,HungerGamesDJ,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:03:48 2015 UTC,"You can gift premium crystals, everything available in the Items store (Stony Cores, Potions, etc.) and Duel Recharges, Stamina Recharges (for arenas), and Pym Canisters, which are exclusive to the Gift store. They cost 10 units each. Everything costs the same as if you were to buy it for yourself (including Duel and Stamina recharges)."

ContestOfChampions,3djk8c,TheJiggersUp,1 point,Fri Jul 17 02:41:44 2015 UTC,I could see a whale gifting alliance quest health and revives to someone else who can't spend lots.
ContestOfChampions,3djk8c,lvillani81,1 point,Fri Jul 17 04:09:15 2015 UTC,"You aren't being greedy, just sensible.  Why not let us send gifts like health, or energy for free.  Like most mobile games."
ContestOfChampions,3djk8c,Lealdini,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:40:45 2015 UTC,"Then I agree with you... I would even go further and say, let me donate some of arena crystals (maybe).. but only be able to donate using units feels pointless.  Or also some Catalysts.. this way we could help others to rank up.."

ContestOfChampions,3dj9z6,grathan,2,Thu Jul 16 18:48:01 2015 UTC,I had to exit out of the game and go back in to be able to join the second round of alliance quests.  Give that a try.
ContestOfChampions,3dj9z6,alSeen,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:09:16 2015 UTC,I should have mentioned that I tried that. It might have to do with joining 2 different clans over the last 2 days. Though someone joined same time and has access so it's weird.
ContestOfChampions,3dj9z6,t0talnonsense,2,Thu Jul 16 19:59:59 2015 UTC,"You have to have been in the alliance when the event started. So, if you weren't there when they first unlocked the event, I don't think you can play. Not sure. No one has moved in or out of our alliance in several days, so we haven't had that issue."
ContestOfChampions,3dj9z6,rockstar323,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:38:50 2015 UTC,I was in one alliance when they got an acceptance email and was excluded. I moved to another alliance and have been excluded 2 straight days.
ContestOfChampions,3dj9z6,rockstar323,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:55:14 2015 UTC,You have to be at least level 17 to compete in the alliance quest.
ContestOfChampions,3dj9z6,rockstar323,2,Thu Jul 16 19:53:41 2015 UTC,I am level 42.
ContestOfChampions,3dj9z6,rockstar323,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:07:25 2015 UTC,Were you with this alliance when the quests started?
ContestOfChampions,3dj9qj,jmislansky,3,Thu Jul 16 18:46:21 2015 UTC,"I run them through the 1v1 for versus crystals that can be a punisher, gold, or units"
ContestOfChampions,3dj9qj,cakow17,2,Thu Jul 16 18:55:45 2015 UTC,"I know a lot of people who sell them because they can't be awakened and gold is sometimes hard to come by, but I keep mine for two reasons: 1. A little boost on my hero rating. 2. When I crack a one star from a daily crystal and I already have that champ, they are converted into class iso. I prefer this to the gold of selling them. :)"
ContestOfChampions,3dj9qj,asterisksceptor,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:50:11 2015 UTC,"You get the exact same ISO from selling them as you do from dupes, so point 2 is moot. Some people just like keeping them to get their bonus multiplier up in Crystal Cornucopia."
ContestOfChampions,3dj9qj,blondepianist,3,Thu Jul 16 23:12:07 2015 UTC,Only reason I keep mine is the huge amount of points they contribute on dupe day.  Can't believe I typed that with a straight face!
ContestOfChampions,3dj9qj,Fredderson,1 point,Fri Jul 17 07:58:09 2015 UTC,You get ISO for selling champs? I thought you only got gold. I've never sold any champs.
ContestOfChampions,3dj9qj,asterisksceptor,2,Mon Jul 20 18:19:39 2015 UTC,"When you get a high streak going in the open (any star champs) arenas, you'll want to switch to a 2 high, 1 low team composition so that the teams you're matched up against have a lower rating. 1-star champs are perfect for this."
ContestOfChampions,3dj6sl,bobwoodshed,3,Thu Jul 16 18:24:54 2015 UTC,"If you joined the alliance after the alliance quest started, you might not see it? There is a note about it when you activate the quest that new members won't have access to it."
ContestOfChampions,3dj6sl,ductyl,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:34:28 2015 UTC,"This happened to us. We have a member who joined and hour after the alliance quest opened for us- he can't access it, everyone else on the alliance can."
ContestOfChampions,3dj6sl,asterisksceptor,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:45:46 2015 UTC,"This is the correct answer. It appears that you have to be in the Alliance before the entire quest is opened, not just the individual days of the quest."
ContestOfChampions,3dj6sl,t0talnonsense,2,Thu Jul 16 21:46:19 2015 UTC,"There's also a member on our alliance without access to the quest.  So you're not the only one. If you're on an alliance with them enabled, you're supposed to have access to it too...You should contact Kabam.  PS: Our member hasn't heard back from them, yet."
ContestOfChampions,3dj6sl,DhamonGrimwulf,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:26:39 2015 UTC,Thanks for that.  I'll try to submit a ticket or whatnot and see if I have any luck.
ContestOfChampions,3dj6sl,Ghostman_Loon,2,Thu Jul 16 18:28:16 2015 UTC,"I finally heard back on my ticket and they told me:  ""Gifting for all players will be slowly rolled out to all players over the next few days. We're slowly releasing this feature as we expect it to get plenty of usage by our players and we want to ensure it is functioning in an optimal fashion, hence the gradual roll out.   I would like to sincerely apologize for the confusion that this issue has caused and I appreciate your patience and understanding in this matter.""  I asked them why all of my alliance except me could do alliance quests... looks like I got Johnny Retard again."

ContestOfChampions,3di3qw,bobiel,3,Thu Jul 16 14:03:55 2015 UTC,There is no efficient path. It's just a complete waste of time if you already have 100% in the released quests.

ContestOfChampions,3di3qw,Harold76,0,Thu Jul 16 18:46:10 2015 UTC,1 cannister for 1 fight in the Ant Man Arena?  Or 1 cannister just for entering the Arena?
ContestOfChampions,3di3qw,bobiel,2,Thu Jul 16 13:50:21 2015 UTC,It's 1 pym canister per opponent instead of gold for 3* arena. 4* arena will cost you 2 pym canisters per opponent
ContestOfChampions,3di3qw,Philly3974,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:18:04 2015 UTC,"Not sure but I'm guessing they aren't giving us 17 PYM Cannisters to run 1 arena, know what I mean?"

ContestOfChampions,3divaw,asterisksceptor,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:22:38 2015 UTC,Did you get some kind of mastery that does poison or something? Or would this be a mix of Juggs' unstoppable ability and Parry or something?

ContestOfChampions,3divaw,Vigardo,0,Thu Jul 16 17:23:30 2015 UTC,What is parry?
ContestOfChampions,3divaw,chaddaddycwizzie,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:35:19 2015 UTC,Does the hit counter include the skills? Could you have blocked the whole time/Unstoppable and used the skills? It looks like you're on a lower level quest
ContestOfChampions,3divaw,FagHatLOL,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:31:36 2015 UTC,"High difference in PI, where you played against Black Bolt, so you hit him when he blocked (or just let him use specials alot), and when it was low health he used L2, and he died from the drawback of the special."
ContestOfChampions,3dkpct,bobsponge933,7,Fri Jul 17 01:29:27 2015 UTC,You've put $500 into this game and the thing you're most upset about is recycled moves?
ContestOfChampions,3dkpct,UnlimitedOsprey,1 point,Fri Jul 17 01:53:06 2015 UTC,Yes. I expect new things from a game that people put thousands of dollars on.
ContestOfChampions,3dkpct,UnlimitedOsprey,5,Fri Jul 17 01:56:45 2015 UTC,Well you should be able to tell from the first day of play that some characters have reused animations. This is a mobile game after all. You spending $500 is your fault alone and if you're unhappy with the results you should have been unhappy for the same reasons after $20 spent. That's your fault for not realizing it earlier.
ContestOfChampions,3dkpct,paulman1976,-1,Fri Jul 17 02:27:20 2015 UTC,"I second that. You're a fool if you put even $1 dollar into these games.

ContestOfChampions,3dkpct,cruise02,3,Fri Jul 17 07:57:00 2015 UTC,Yeah! Fuck the game developers who provide hours of entertainment!
ContestOfChampions,3dkpct,subredditor41,3,Fri Jul 17 12:26:45 2015 UTC,I think Kabam said they recycle moves and stuff to make the game run smoother and faster. I like anything that makes load screens shorter

Feel free to comment on their forum too so we can get them to notice us:  I think the reward should be even better than just a 4 star crystal. The reason being that the majority of mine and many other alliances has completed Act 3 100%, but none has reached level 50 yet. In fact you can easily find many alliances with a rating around 1 million and NO ONE is level 50. It simply a harder achievement in my opinion. Also when the 5 stars arrive the 4 star crystal will have less value. Here is what I suggest :   one 4*crystal two tier 4 catalyst or 1 alpha catalyst  iso equivalent to that of duping a 4 star    Greedy? I don't think so. Hard work should be rewarded."

ContestOfChampions,3di69e,unreal_insan1ty,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:48:05 2015 UTC,"Now that my Deadpool is duped, I think he's the best mutant. Unduped I had him behind Colossus. Colossus is easier to play, but that's boring to me.   Forget about Wolverine for now. He isn't bad, but my 3* is lv 32 regeneration and it's great some fights, but sometimes doesn't trigger at all."

ContestOfChampions,3diq8a,JOC9000,3,Thu Jul 16 16:25:19 2015 UTC,"Dexterity. (S)he who controls the crit, controls the fight."
ContestOfChampions,3diq8a,kinnell,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:09:41 2015 UTC,Does it really dodge everything tho?
ContestOfChampions,3diq8a,kinnell,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:16:23 2015 UTC,"I feel its description is a misleading. It doesn't really help me dodge anything, rather it rewards me for dodging. Without Dexterity, I would have dodged the attack, but what it does, in my perception, is when I dash back and I ""dodge"" an attack, it adds a ""crit"" counter that makes the next hit I land a critical hit. I say ""the next hit I land"" because if the opponent blocks, I still have the ""crit"" counter until I actually land a punch which is awesome. For people who are good at dashing back, this gives them a reliable and precise means to land critical hits."
ContestOfChampions,3diq8a,DhamonGrimwulf,3,Thu Jul 16 17:38:15 2015 UTC,"Actually, there are some very specific situations that you actually 'dodge' an attack: - aggressive AI, when you dodge back, it would sometimes dodge after you, and punch you repeatedly in the face. No longer, you dodge and the AI stops there. - any AI: skills like Ironman's L2 or Vision's L1, with a long-range diagonal attack, would still hit you if you dodged back - you needed to defend those attacks). Now, you also dodge them.  Also, it is generally better to dodge now, then to defend, if you know how to time it, since you get 0% damage with it. You can dodge everything, including SpiderMan's L1 (requires some training though, since it has multiple attacks - you can dodge some and defend the rest)"

ContestOfChampions,3diq8a,Double___Dragon,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:43:41 2015 UTC,"It ""dodges everything"" meaning if you time it right, you CAN dodge anything but an L3. This includes ones like Iron Man and Hawkeye. I love it, personally."

Some heroes I would have trouble with like the hulk at the end of the hard daily event I can dominate now where I would struggle and make take 2 heroes to kill  -It seems like the AI has almost totally stopped trying to attack me first now, might just be in my head but the initial easy parry seems to be mostly gone now. Not sure if the AI learns you play style or not  -When you get it going, its amazing."

ContestOfChampions,3degpp,tatianasetsuko,1 point,Thu Jul 16 00:18:46 2015 UTC,I don't like that it means you tie up your most powerful characters for hours on end and you can't use them in any other quests.  I only have a handful of very ranked up threes and fours and I really do need them for other quests (like getting the harder catalysts so I can help my alliance in the rank up event)  If it wasn't for that it would be great.  (this wouldn't be about 'subtly' encouraging us to spend money would it? Heaven forfend!)

ContestOfChampions,3dftit,mavajo,1 point,Wed Jul 15 23:51:52 2015 UTC,It's all relative.  Compared to normal arenas it's not at all a lot.

ContestOfChampions,3dftit,skreddy56,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:15:51 2015 UTC,I hardly played any and got 300k. Perhaps you don't have many 3 star Champs? I was getting 15k per fight between 8-12 wins in.

ContestOfChampions,3ddtbg,thedukeoftank,1 point,Wed Jul 15 14:17:18 2015 UTC,I always go with my duped Gamora against Wolverine/Deadpool. Bleeding counters the regen process.
ContestOfChampions,3ddtbg,montiburns1,1 point,Wed Jul 15 14:34:21 2015 UTC,I don't think it is a good idea to use Gamora against wolverine because of my fighting style with him. This is only for more rating players than you: You hit as much as you can when he blocks You hit once or twice and then dodge back. This really helps not trigger his regeneration. And finally blast your L3 on him.
ContestOfChampions,3ddtbg,DhamonGrimwulf,1 point,Wed Jul 15 23:00:57 2015 UTC,"I would say Magneto is >> Deadpool I believe Nullify does not work on an awakened Deadpool, since his regen from the Awakened power is a Passive, unlike his ability Regen that is a boost.  Magneto can apply the nullify healing, which I assume will also cancel Deadpool's awakened regen."
ContestOfChampions,3ddtbg,BAzzyBaby,1 point,Wed Jul 15 15:22:13 2015 UTC,I'd say Scarlett witch is pretty solid for UC as well since she prevents the unstoppable a lot. Anyone with a strong L3 is awesome against Dr Strange/Iron fist/Electro as well

ContestOfChampions,3df8ak,VeronicaLowe,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:47:22 2015 UTC,"Its based on if your device has enough ram to keep the app running while your other app is running. If not, it auto unloads the game and has to restart it."
ContestOfChampions,3df8ak,VeronicaLowe,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:00:24 2015 UTC,"Well, that is weird because I didn't install any new apps when this started happening, and it also does not always happen, just about 85% of the time."
ContestOfChampions,3df8ak,VeronicaLowe,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:26:27 2015 UTC,Since the update it probably uses more ram due to weather effects and other features. Probably different amounts depending what you are doing at the time.

ContestOfChampions,3ddp09,alex_steele,4,Wed Jul 15 13:39:48 2015 UTC,"I think Vision has fallen significantly for me since the AI started blocking L2s with regularity. The fact that his supers do nothing when blocked can often make him a liability, since it's the L2 that made him so dominant before.   I haven't been lucky enough to play with him yet, but I'm guessing Ultron is the new top Tech champ, solely from all his insane effects. The guy does everything."
ContestOfChampions,3ddp09,NimNams,3,Wed Jul 15 14:50:22 2015 UTC,"Ultron isn't that good. I have both versions. His abilities all work very minimally which makes them more flash than effective. Star-lord, is the best. Iron man is decent also cause of his specials,synergies and regen"
ContestOfChampions,3ddp09,Prospect1979,3,Wed Jul 15 15:15:54 2015 UTC,"my    I kinda disagree about Ultron. He start of just decent, but he gains an ability for every rank up. The fact that he dodge every 7 seconds, get armour ups when blocking, heals a total of half his health through a fight, and has a guaranteed critical hit every 5 hit (with possibilty of critical hitting other hits as well), makes him a beast with no equal in the tech class. He also bleeds, is immune to bleed and poison, and often stuns on specials. The fact that he has the same basic stats as Collossuss (meaning loads of health, without concidering the extra heals), makes him better then any other tech in my oppinion. He has no weak points, and hits hard. When you learn to time the critical hit every 5 hits, you can really do aaaalot of damage.   Though i do agree that a Ultron 1/1 is weak! He needs to be 3/1 or even better 4/1 to actually be a beast."
ContestOfChampions,3ddp09,Vigardo,2,Wed Jul 15 17:05:05 2015 UTC,my 3* is duped and maxed and dominates everyone.
ContestOfChampions,3ddp09,Ghostman_Loon,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:57:18 2015 UTC,My 3* maxed and my 4* is 3/30. He has decent health but no power. His bleed maybe the lowest per tic and is almost pointless. All his specials are weak as well. He's a solid champ and almost the best of a weak class.  I'll take star lord over him myself but to each their own.
ContestOfChampions,3ddp09,Prospect1979,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:42:31 2015 UTC,"His power is among the higher overall, best health out of all champions if we count his regen at 25 and 50%, and his bleeds are good if you time it so that you hit his L1 on a critical when he has bleed, because of his ability. That way you do 1,5x damage on a critical, makes it an easy 1,5-2k hit, with chance of stun. His specials are not great, i agree, but his L1 is solid when combining it with a guaranteed critical ;)  Though true, to each their own, but i feel that if used correctly, Ultron is the best :D"
ContestOfChampions,3ddp09,Vigardo,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:55:47 2015 UTC,Among the highest ? Hmm not sure if your talking about amongst his class or in the game period. Hopefully the first 1 or I'd argue your among the highest 😎
ContestOfChampions,3ddp09,Prospect1979,1 point,Thu Jul 16 13:44:01 2015 UTC,"Among the highest was probably the wrong wording, i apologize for that. Champions like Electro is way above him, but he is above avverage in power, and with critical hit guaranteed, has critical hit rate around 25-30 %. This makes him a very hard hitter, if used correctly together with his bleed ;)"
ContestOfChampions,3ddp09,Vigardo,3,Thu Jul 16 14:54:41 2015 UTC,"Agree that Vision has been neutered.  Especially in 3 star arena.  Specifically in that arena and possibly at large, Starlord has emerged as the top Tech imo.  If your gamelpan is wait for L3 then his constant fury and increasing damage per hit combined with a strong L3 makes him my top 2* at this point."
ContestOfChampions,3ddp09,arfcom,3,Wed Jul 15 15:50:29 2015 UTC,"Agree that the game has changed.  The new plan has to include who's best if you just wait on L3.   Cosmic: Thor (duped).  Unbelievable what he does. Best in the game facing way higher PI opponents. Skill: Punisher. Best L3 in the game. Constant fury. Balanced. Mutant: Colossus more than he used to be.  Still don't like his style. Tech: Starlord now that Vision's L2 has been neutered. Fury all day, accumulating damage with streak, strong L3. Balanced.  Argument could be made for Hulkbuster because L3. Ultron is the most fun to use. Mystic: I love SWitch because of the way she just dominates some fights with an array of random and fun buffs.  Don't have Strange. Haven't leveled my 3* UC. Science: Note sure.  Love my Spidey due to hard hits and quick wins, but he's not the best when over-matched. Don't have 3* Hulk or Electro and Captain is a bit boring for me."
ContestOfChampions,3ddp09,arfcom,1 point,Wed Jul 15 15:58:00 2015 UTC,I definitely agree with your choices. However Dr. strange is still excellent despite a low PI and Iron Fist has the capability to wreck anyone in his way when duped.
ContestOfChampions,3ddp09,Bobqee,1 point,Thu Jul 16 00:24:02 2015 UTC,I wish I had Strange to play with but I don't.  I have a maxed nonduped 3* IF that was a questing rock for me.  I love the fast wins and advantage against Collosus types.
ContestOfChampions,3ddp09,arfcom,2,Thu Jul 16 00:43:42 2015 UTC,"Not too long ago I pulled a 4* hawkeye, although I already have a fully maxed out 3x awakened hawkeye. Will the 4* version ever be as good as the 3* version if it's never awakened?"
ContestOfChampions,3ddp09,cmgirardi,1 point,Wed Jul 15 14:39:44 2015 UTC,Yes and no. It depends on the dupde ability IMO. a 4* will always have a higher PI and much better base stats. There are only a couple duped abilities that make the 3* worth it in my eyes.
ContestOfChampions,3ddp09,Double___Dragon,3,Wed Jul 15 15:40:48 2015 UTC,"for skill, a duplicated 3* or 4* black panther that can ""stack"" his bleeds, meaning you can get five or six bleeds going simultaneously destroys a 4* duped hulk, not an easy task...I vote he's the best skill when duplicated..."
ContestOfChampions,3ddp09,julesryan,1 point,Wed Jul 15 14:28:11 2015 UTC,I even eat up the MMX guys' top Hulks with an unduped 4* black panther. Those are my easiest fights at that high of a streak.
ContestOfChampions,3ddp09,Double___Dragon,1 point,Wed Jul 15 15:39:27 2015 UTC,"Too many tough champs with Bleed immunity.  BP, like Gamora, is disqualified from top champ discussion on that basis.  imo."
ContestOfChampions,3ddp09,arfcom,1 point,Wed Jul 15 15:47:33 2015 UTC,"I would say Hawkeye is better. His bleeds can be triggered from L1, his hemorrhage can go for a very long time allowing for very safe play, and the power drain allows for incredibly slim chances of an L3 ever being used against him."
ContestOfChampions,3ddp09,ChillFactory,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:29:04 2015 UTC,I like it but I'd say Hulk is now the best science after streak 15. My favorite Skill is Black widow and them together is disgustingly good.
ContestOfChampions,3ddp09,BAzzyBaby,1 point,Wed Jul 15 14:06:21 2015 UTC,"I still land Hawkeye's L1 easily against the tough AI, I just do it mid-combo. I've always thought Punisher was the best though. He's also my only 4* though so I might be a little biased there lol"
ContestOfChampions,3ddp09,Sylgamesh,1 point,Wed Jul 15 14:12:17 2015 UTC,"Also I still prefer Gamora for cosmic, L1 is easy to land and that bleed/assassination chance is just too good. Electro solid top choice for Science, I'd say its between him and Hulk. Mutant for arenas I like Wolverine a lot now because of the stacks of regens he gets with the amount of hits tough AI champs dish out"
ContestOfChampions,3ddp09,Sylgamesh,1 point,Wed Jul 15 14:14:49 2015 UTC,Daredevil is the best skill. B.W. Is a close second.

ContestOfChampions,3ddp09,olliex2achsenfree,2,Wed Jul 15 14:14:29 2015 UTC,I got lucky enough to pull a 4* Hawkeye when I first started playing. He has been my workhorse ever since. His L1 is just so good. I'd say Hawk.
ContestOfChampions,3ddp09,rockstar323,2,Wed Jul 15 14:23:13 2015 UTC,That's tough. Do you get past 15 in 4* arena?

ContestOfChampions,3ddp09,House0fEl,1 point,Wed Jul 15 15:28:57 2015 UTC,Why is Vision's L2 neutered?  I land it all the time.
ContestOfChampions,3ddp09,House0fEl,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:21:19 2015 UTC,Past a streak of 15 in the arena L2's get insta-blocked (for the most part). If you hit a blocking character with Vision it does nothing.
ContestOfChampions,3ddp09,House0fEl,2,Wed Jul 15 18:03:25 2015 UTC,"No offense, but I did read that people are saying that.  I'm saying I land pretty much whenever I want to.  I'd say I hit with it 95% of the time I use it.    I'm guessing people aren't very creative when it comes to using L2s in general."

ContestOfChampions,3ddr2w,brrrttt,3,Thu Jul 16 03:06:36 2015 UTC,"If you don't plan on competing in the 3* arena I don't see a point in keeping your high ranked 2*s. I sold off about 7 teams of rank 3 2 *s when I decided to stop playing that arena. Since then I got them all back and duped them again. I kept 3 teams for arenas that let you use all champs just to jump start my multiplier for my 3 & 4 *s. You don't come close to getting the gold or ISO you put into them but I figure if they're just sitting there not being used might as well get what I can out of them. Just remember it will drop your Hero Rating, so if you're in an alliance with a rating requirement or plan on joining one it could hurt you there."
ContestOfChampions,3ddr2w,rockstar323,2,Wed Jul 15 14:34:17 2015 UTC,"Depends how many 3* you have on your main. If you already have 10 teams, then I don't see any harm in selling your 2's if you don't plan on running 3 arenas anymore.

ContestOfChampions,3deyye,mdkosu,5,Wed Jul 15 19:17:18 2015 UTC,"I personally think it is awesome, you have one day to beat a map and it gives everyone in a battle group a chance to contribute, no one is grinding.  That's what we all were bitching about anyway.  If you want to grind, go to the arena.  I suspect the top scores are going to be very efficient and collaborative alliances."
ContestOfChampions,3deyye,t0talnonsense,3,Wed Jul 15 21:41:42 2015 UTC,"which eliminates them from playing the normal arena or other events.    Are you sure it eliminates them from arenas? It should only affect one of the two, either questing or arenas. They use two different cooldowns. Quests use your personal energy, and arena's use champ energy."
ContestOfChampions,3deyye,C4NN1B41,3,Wed Jul 15 19:33:03 2015 UTC,You can still play arenas while you are in an alliance quest
ContestOfChampions,3deyye,MnMSolo,2,Wed Jul 15 19:45:36 2015 UTC,"yes. must know for sure, bc that will determine weather ppl choose an event they may not have a chance at getting anything for. or choosing the arenas where they can get crystals and heroes easily. If it is like you describe then im sure the 30 ppl in our alliance wont be participating lol"
ContestOfChampions,3deyye,skoredd,2,Wed Jul 15 19:37:23 2015 UTC,"the point is strategy. Most people have a 5-man quest team, w/some alternates for gates or catalyst quests. Giving over champs to an alliance event encourages collaboration, & is an incentive to keep ranking up promising but underutilized champs. Like aisf61 said, if you clear a path, the person behind you can go forward. It's like leapfrog. None of it works without coordination & organization."

I mean this might be because I explored every regular quest but I think the fun is that it s hard and a long run too. You think ahead and collaborate. A not-much-of-a-big-deal energy limit for a 24 hour qquest with exciting rewards is not enough to keep the real players out of that mode I think, though it might blow impatient greedy gamers like you sound"
ContestOfChampions,3deyye,apunkgaming,2,Wed Jul 15 23:04:26 2015 UTC,What game design you work in? All the top games have waiting time too. Even Candy Crush.
ContestOfChampions,3deyye,MnMSolo,1 point,Thu Jul 16 01:52:03 2015 UTC,You're one of the people that complains about everything. My alliance had 3 battle groups start at 3 PM and 2 of the 3 are at 100% and the third is whittling down ultron. It's not that hard if you coordinate. We beat the superior iron man in about 4 hours (including recharge time) by sending 2 guys down each path. Makes it real easy.
ContestOfChampions,3deyye,aisf61,1 point,Thu Jul 16 03:51:17 2015 UTC,"yea doesn't make sense to introduce an event that last 24 hours and you can only move one spot per 30 min. what if it is a small alliance and not everyone is active, or what if some one goes down the same path behind another guy? does that use energy for both players or just the one that moved first?"
ContestOfChampions,3deyye,t0talnonsense,6,Wed Jul 15 19:25:04 2015 UTC,does that use energy for both players or just the one that moved first?   I believe any spot an alliance member already moved to doesn't use up energy again
ContestOfChampions,3deyye,MnMSolo,2,Wed Jul 15 19:30:15 2015 UTC,"Our alliance is in the beta, but haven't started moving yet. From our understanding, once one player unlocks a path, it is open for everyone. So, you only burn energy to move forward a single space. To maximize energy, you need to wait for someone to finish a fight or die before moving."
ContestOfChampions,3deyye,VeronicaLowe,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:31:33 2015 UTC,"If it s a small alliance and they ll bitch about not beimg able to complete it then this means that they are not ready for it yet.

Incredibly stupid of Kabam to come out with a new way to play where the biggest feature is something that keeps you from playing.  Cool idea having a collaborative map, but Kabam needs to realize that preventing people from playing your game is not good game design. Also, which the pathetic amount of every you get, you will NEVER achieve the higher level awards, you just can't cover enough of the map.   I just id a quick scan of the map, there looks to be about EIGHY nodes on it. And you get FIVE energy. Yeah, awesome way to play the game."

The drop rate for tier 3 class catalyst is so ridiculous that you almost have to spend units to acquire them. I have had to get 4 tier 3 class cats. The first 2 I got by grinding. The second 2 I ended up dropping 400 units a piece on. Both of the ones I spent units on I had played over 15 rounds without a single drop and ""amazingly"" the offer to buy them popped up right after I finished the last run I could make before the event ended. Kabam won't make any changes that cause us to spend less units."
ContestOfChampions,3daycf,rockstar323,1 point,Wed Jul 15 14:15:44 2015 UTC,"They will if there is enough pressure.

ContestOfChampions,3daycf,rockstar323,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:49:33 2015 UTC,The problem is top alliance's like Awakened would be against it.

If they complained about that you better believe they would go crazy over making tier 4 cats more attainable.

ContestOfChampions,3dbi3k,Trefin,1 point,Wed Jul 15 02:05:56 2015 UTC,"It's not so much amazingly USEFUL for me, but rather a fun challenge. The only benefit parrying has instead of dashing and then hitting is that parry reduces damage.  For me, parry has added a new element to the combat, where I can parry instead of constant *dash       back to avoid hit-dash forward hit combo-repeat.  As far as USEFULNESS goes I'd consider dexterity over parry. It allows you to dodge ANY attack dashing back (yes, including IM's L1/2, Thor's L2, Hawkeye's L1/2, etc.) And it gives you a crit boost. Been very useful for me so far, especially in the arena."
ContestOfChampions,3dbi3k,Double___Dragon,1 point,Wed Jul 15 04:52:03 2015 UTC,"The only benefit parrying has instead of dashing and then hitting is that parry reduces damage.

ContestOfChampions,3dbi3k,khafra,2,Wed Jul 15 17:25:59 2015 UTC,"That's a great point, and I've had that happen. But I'd consider the ability to avoid the damage that would be taken by blocking a full-field length special and the crit boost over the combo I'd get 80% of the time and the damage reduction. I hope that makes sense, haha"

ContestOfChampions,3dcwh7,RinkRock,3,Wed Jul 15 07:45:28 2015 UTC,"The load times are almost as long as the action (which in itself is very repetitive and unoriginal).  The global chat is useless. (too hard to start a conversation with someone, it should be as easy as clicking on someone and responding which would create a temporary board without befriending them) Also anyone who clicks on the original comment joins the temporary conversation.  The alliance chat board is mostly useless. There needs to be a seperate one for important messages that that don't get buried by non-officers.  There is no ISO. I want to participate in the 4* arena, but leveling up my 3*s to compete against BrutalDLX 5/50s (not that its even possible at streak 15 wtf) would take me 10 years at current iso acqusition rates.  The game has too many dinosaurs clogging the alliance system. They got big feeding of copious amounts of easy crystals and they find the current milestones uninspiring so they just sit there with their high ranking and boatloads of 4 star champs.  The events are all too similar. Cornicopia, catylist clash, 3 and 4 star arena. They should get some orginal distinction from each other.  The time spent with 1 star chars is too short. You have an army of twos without appreciating the fact that ones exist and are soon bent on obtaining 3s and fours. This could include a 1 star arena with some 1 star champs as prizes.  The storyline is woefully short and then falls off a cliff.   Leveling up is pretty much useless. There is slight gains in quest energy and mastery points, but it does't go far enough. I have no inspiration to go past30 and will soon hit the wall at 50 anyways.  The fighting mechanics need expansion. block swipe and attack. I think there could be more here, like multi tap evade, being able to put the brakes on when dashing in and hit reverse and possibly even execute a block, jump and duck buttons near the top, longer combos that have complex finger patterns.  The women character faces could use more pixels wtf.  The L3 stun/bleed combo is overused in tough matches as a substitute for AI (too many characters abuse this currently).  Kabam should bring back the original coder who worked on this game. It's obvious that person is no longer involved. Let that person have at it full time with no other projects."

And also want to emphasize the ISO thing: The story quests you can advance ends and at some point( which you can reach not so hardly) you have to re play the same quests but the ISO farming business is boring and the rewards not so great. The small things I wanna add is an idea that was used in Marvel nemesis several years ago and something else: More synergy bonuses would be nice. We would love to have special team bonuses like:5 champs all from the avengers, all Stark Industry, all x men and etc. that reward us with gold/XP/ISO multipliers. Also we would like it if we got bonus rewards from perfect fights or stuff like that so that the fighting is not rewarded as just WIN: Everything LOSS: nothing"

You could make a new account, and use the units from your old account to send the new one a whole bunch of premium crystals. Providing a large boost in the newbie bracket, which could result in tons and tons of arena wins? All without having to spend any actual money?

ContestOfChampions,3dbj7n,lkz3100,2,Wed Jul 15 00:08:43 2015 UTC,If you can get the infinite streak going you should definitely go for more 3/1 . Because honestly i find it hard to fight those super AI after 20++ streak w.o the L3 because they kept on blocking all my skills most of the time.
ContestOfChampions,3dbj7n,knightzeemo,0,Wed Jul 15 00:33:34 2015 UTC,"I usually got the infinite streak going without a problem but now i recently opened a star lord from crystal and that gave me another team with gamora drax and him. I put them on after I had 22 streak but now the PI level was not easy, not even medium but straight 3/30 monsters and I fuuhkin lost the streak now i cannot start it and i lost my chance to dupe BB.

ContestOfChampions,3dbici,ChillFactory,2,Wed Jul 15 00:02:03 2015 UTC,"Now that some people said that parry is not unstoppably OP, I was wondering how great dexterity is gonna be.  Evading ALL ATTACK sounds good enough without the crit rate%"
ContestOfChampions,3dbici,knightzeemo,2,Wed Jul 15 00:24:51 2015 UTC,It's been my best mastery yet. You can evade attacks like Iron man's L1/2 free of damage. Saved my butt in the arena! The only thing parry has over this is that it's a new form of gameplay almost - as opposed to dashing all the time. Parry requires concentration and timing.  I'd say dexterity is a far better route to take with your masteries.
ContestOfChampions,3dbici,Double___Dragon,1 point,Wed Jul 15 05:07:40 2015 UTC,"Makes me wish you could see what masteries are in use by your opponents. Like, I know Iron Man will shoot lasers at me, but who can tell if it's safe to punch him or not?"
ContestOfChampions,3dbici,skreddy56,1 point,Wed Jul 15 11:57:53 2015 UTC,Evade doesn't work as well as I hoped. It doesn't dodge attacks that go forward.
ContestOfChampions,3dbici,jrgutier,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:21:46 2015 UTC,"If you spec into the defense tree, Parry is a one point wonder. Having a high chance of Perfect Block and then having a single point in Parry means that you are cutting off an opponents attack very frequently. I feel like this is far more beneficial than trying to evade otherwise unblockable attacks like Scarlet Witch's L1/L2 or Ironman's L1/L2 since I don't trust the hitboxes in this game for those attacks."

ContestOfChampions,3d8h2b,TokyoLogger,3,Tue Jul 14 09:48:39 2015 UTC,"Formatting edit:  Hi people,  I have been playing this game for 7 months, I have watched it grow from a small fan base to a massive fan base. I know it has changed and not for the best in someways, in others for the best. Kabam could easily make this game great and fun again, by just making a few small changes. Here they are    Put 4 star champs back in the daily crystal, and also all the other 3 stars as well. When it was first starting out this was an option, you actually wanted to open it as there was a small possibly of a good champ.  Make arenas more user friendly 2 star only arenas, 3 star only arenas and 4 star only arenas. This would make it so much better and less need for grinding all the time, when kabam had a 3 star only arena I got a 146 win streak and 1.7 mil points, now its back to the old way im lucky to get a 13 win streak and 1.4 mil points. Make the 4 star milestone in the arena 1.5 mil points instead of the 2 premium 30 units and 3000 battle chips, this way people can get to that milestone, also do the same in the 2 star arena. Give us act 4, yes the antman event is nice but I want to continue the main story not a sub plot, connected to the movie.  Get rid of the bracket system it does no one any favours unless your in the top 1% of top players. Let lower people test out your new ideas instead of the awakened alliance, and top alliances, we the masses make this game tick not them, they just fill your pockets with money (that I understand your a business and money is key to you)  Make the 3 star crystals and 4 star crystals easier to buy instead of making us buy loads of PC's before the rare offer comes up they would make more money this way. Make it fun again instead of a chore, to have to log on every 2 hrs to do your 40 min grind in the arena. thoughts guys??"
ContestOfChampions,3d8h2b,redditorguy,2,Tue Jul 14 19:17:42 2015 UTC,"I completely agree the things you said except the brackets and act 4. I finished act 3 except thanos and even now i feel like i finished the game's single player mode (I know the online is against the CPU). So releasing interactive subplots and doing events according to them and not having to level a huge ton of champs before doing the next quest is better. Also I have some things to add: I think the fighting mode is not given as much importance as it should, so i think we should increase rewards for the skill difference. I'm thinking maybe it would be hard on arenas so, considering that the game already counts our hits and received hits and combos, why not give us bonus gold and xp for them? They can add x2 bonus to xp-gold and maybe a x1.5 bonus for ISO 8 if we make a perfect run in a quest. (No reduced health without any potions) Last suggestion I have is that they could do another type of synergy bonus for quests, which may or may not be a bonus for rewards, and it would be giving bonus for special teams. We have synergies for individual champions but we would love to have stuff like : ""Avengers Assemble"" when we make a team out of: Hulk,Hawkeye,Iron Man, Thor, Cap. America/ Black Widow Or I don't know a team of villains or maybe ""Stark Industry"" type of thing when we have ""Iron Man,Superior Iron Man, Vision, Hulkbuster, The Vision/Ultron"". or ""X-Men"".  8-9 years ago I think I played Marvel Nemesis and this was a thing in the game. This will cause us to be a lot more happy and enthusiastic about getting champs, we would think about these synergies instead of thinking only about his/her PI or specials. I would be really happy if this idea was heard by Kabam, if anyone has friends who work for Marvel please let them know."
ContestOfChampions,3d8h2b,menkent,2,Tue Jul 14 13:34:54 2015 UTC,If you're logging in every two hours to grind through a full rotation of your champs in the arena then that's your fault and you're part of the problem. You're justifying every decision they've made that requires more and more farming and grinding and meaningless event rewards and unrealistic milestones.
ContestOfChampions,3d8h2b,app0jax,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:43:11 2015 UTC,"So your suggestion is to stop playing, then."
ContestOfChampions,3d8h2b,menkent,2,Tue Jul 14 18:15:20 2015 UTC,"Play as much as you want to, just don't act like kabam is making you do it. If you're grinding for hours a day it's your choice."
ContestOfChampions,3d8h2b,Ghostman_Loon,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:40:47 2015 UTC,"they need to take 4* champs out of the 4* arena. As soon as I played my max 3, I'm hit with max duped 4, no matter what round I'm on.   I like a challenge, but when I fight a Colossus, knock of a big chunk of his energy without being hit and then his L3 kills me, it is just a joke... and trying to coax a L1 or L2 just isn't happening."
ContestOfChampions,3d8h2b,pq1226,1 point,Tue Jul 14 14:10:59 2015 UTC,I think the best thing they could do I make the 2* version of every single character immediately available in a 2* only crystal. There are plenty of people like me I am sure who play this game to collect the various characters we know and love from comics. So you put them all in one crystal and you make certain players like Ultron a very rare chance drop. Make it 40 units. I would buy the living shit out of it just trying to collect all the heroes.
ContestOfChampions,3d8h2b,cruise02,1 point,Tue Jul 14 14:12:12 2015 UTC,"I kind of like it the way it is. Getting characters as soon as they're available is a bonus for those dedicated enough to grind the arenas, which typically have higher cut-offs when brand new characters are the prize. I usually sit those out due to the high cut-off. I know I'll get the characters in crystals eventually. I can work my current teams up while I wait."
ContestOfChampions,3d8h2b,pq1226,2,Tue Jul 14 19:17:40 2015 UTC,I would be fine if I still had to wait a little bit but certain characters are just not available as 2* and I think that should change. No reason we cant have Rocket as a 2* now.
ContestOfChampions,3d8h2b,cruise02,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:19:25 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's true. I have him duped as a 3* already, and I didn't play either one of his arenas.  I could get behind a 2* milestone reward for each arena too."

It allows you for extra members to make up a team. However, 1* champions can be debatably sold due to their minimal impact on the arenas."
ContestOfChampions,3db3iv,astrospeedyj,10,Tue Jul 14 22:24:20 2015 UTC,"The 1* champions are more useful to me than the 2*. On the crystal arena where you can mix ratings, I go into hard battles with two good characters plus one worthless 1* character. This brings down the average strength of the team so the other two have a good chance of winning, and the 1* is just used as a sucker. This keeps my 3X bonus alive."

One point for .5% crit isnt worth it, but 5/5 for 10% is. And ill use those 4 extras elsewhere. I'm still waiting for someone to make a mastery tree calculator so i can play around on it lol."

If you have him (and he's duped at least once) I would definitely max him out first, then Iron Fist, then Gamora. Drax wouldn't hurt to bring along either for Kang at least since his stacking fury in a long fight against a tech would be advantageous. I'd leave Punisher, Iron Man, and Deadpool at home unless you need the regenerative heroes (Iron Man and Deadpool) for clearing the level prior to the boss, but bear in mind Iron Man would be weak against Thanos and Deadpool weak against Kang. Black Panther is my most duped 3* and can be a real monster on longer fights when you can stack his bleed up, but since yours isn't duped I wouldn't bring him along. Captain Marvel I have a 3* but I haven't gotten around to using her for anything other than arenas so don't really have anything for her.  As far as what five should you bring? Assuming they're all at least rank 3/level 30:  Gamora, Iron Fist, Star Lord (against Kang only), Drax, Black Panther, Deadpool (against Thanos only)"

ContestOfChampions,3d4h0a,bobiel,6,Mon Jul 13 13:20:32 2015 UTC,"The amount of people who are actually ""max level"" is very small due to the sheer amount of ISO, catalysts and time you need to rank up every single champion. Introduction of 5 star champions would probably be enough to keep that small percentage busy for a long time/for a lot of money, considering how hard it would be to find a 5 star champion, and then being able to rank it up. Who knows, we could see the introduction of a tier 2 alpha catalyst only obtainable by the top 1% in a special 7 day arena.  If alliance quests are pulled off correctly, then I feel that would be enough to keep most people in an alliance happy. Trying to create a new ""clash of clans"" is almost impossible, but alliance wars don't seem bad as long as they are executed correctly i.e don't involve you going against a significantly superior alliance and getting destroyed losing parts of your treasury or something."

If a 4 star crystal costs 2500 units, then the cost of a 5 star crystal could go upwards of 5000-10000 units.

ContestOfChampions,3d4h0a,CkyLaurence,0,Tue Jul 14 08:06:51 2015 UTC,"One huge difference between this game and Clash of Clans is that this game makes it more difficult to progress and succeed unless you're willing to spend a lot of money.   The clan aspect of COC definitely makes it a lot of fun, but I can also not spend a dime and still max out eventually. I can't even get a fucking 4* hero from the arena unless I spend a shit load on units.   I'm sure the alliance stuff in MCOC will be cool, but if they think that's going to make them as popular as COC then they're dreaming."
ContestOfChampions,3d4h0a,coldpiece,5,Mon Jul 13 16:21:43 2015 UTC,"That is a big lie, you don't need money in order to succeed in MCOC. All you need to do is play the damn game. Instead of spending all your damn units on premium hero crystals and complaining about not getting 3 Stars, save them and buy a 3 star crystal. The game gives you PHC's like fucking candy. I've been playing 3 months, haven't spent a penny and have 30k rating with only 3 4 stars, 2 from PHC's. Its true getting 4 stars from arenas will cost units and money which is the biggest reason it gets hard to progress once you get 3 stars."

I am playing this game actively since December, I still have only 3 4*, the same as you got playing only half the time. I got one 4* from PC after 5 months of playing, the others came from a 4* crystal (which I saved units for weeks) and the 4* Unstoppable Colossus. As you said:   Its true getting 4 stars from arenas will cost units and money which is the biggest reason it gets hard to progress once you get 3 stars.   So yes, the only way to reliably get a 4 star is by using units and money in the arena. Otherwise, it is only about luck and you have had plenty. The only hope this will improve is the 4 star in the 2 million milestone."

Also the most I've received for getting both paths (100%) is two catalysts (one time I did get 4 but that has happened once in over 100 completions of those quests).
ContestOfChampions,3d55co,DhamonGrimwulf,2,Mon Jul 13 16:35:45 2015 UTC,They were infinitely better and more achievable than these 3-Day events with astronomically better rewards.  The 4 star UC was easier in some cases than this friggin alpha has been in 3-day. For example 7-day rankup only required 10k each for 4 star UC and you picked up an alpha on the way there.

As for the milestones, I don't really have anything to say about those except that they're meant to be worked for. They're designed so people who put in the effort still get a 3/4* and while not being completely blown out of the rankings by the people who play every 2 hours every day."
ContestOfChampions,3d6h6z,Biinarii,-2,Mon Jul 13 22:27:10 2015 UTC,"Well it is Kabam after all that set the milestone so high.  And even though there are people who work that hard, that doesn't mean that Kabam has to explicitly appeal to them exclusively.  They can set the milestone lower.  I feel that 300,000 is quite a feat in and of itself, and 450,000 is just ridiculous."
ContestOfChampions,3d6h6z,MnMSolo,2,Mon Jul 13 22:32:53 2015 UTC,its not that bad. 150k a day  that is 3 complete run troughs at 45k a run. you put up 150k a day and  are guaranteed that three star. ( could be wrong on the  math  but it is around there somewhere.)
ContestOfChampions,3d6h6z,chaddaddycwizzie,1 point,Mon Jul 13 22:49:42 2015 UTC,It doesn't only appeal to those people because arena milestones are not the only way to get 3* champs. Even before that you can get PHCs if you aren't as serious about it it still takes some work but you can get just as good or better from those
ContestOfChampions,3d6h6z,knightzeemo,1 point,Tue Jul 14 10:07:44 2015 UTC,Yes as a new player I will never achieve 450k milestones not w.o a sets of 3/1 champ. Maybe it is not intended for new user after all.

ContestOfChampions,3d6h6z,knightzeemo,0,Mon Jul 13 23:29:42 2015 UTC,How many 3* and 4* do you have to achieve over 1mil ? It seems like you are still in noobie brackets too with that low cutoff.
ContestOfChampions,3d6h6z,Obliwan,0,Tue Jul 14 00:28:09 2015 UTC,"I've done 250k in a day in the 3* arena without any problems on a day off. Maybe 6 or 7 cycles through my teams. It really isn't that hard if you play efficiently.  Also I would say that in the 3* arena, getting the 3* should require some work and the milestone at 450k makes perfect sense to me. It requires some time investment, but it is then guaranteed. If you want to play more casually then you shouldn't expect to achieve everything. You can still get the other milestones and get the 3 and 4*s from the premium crystals you gather. It'll just take you longer."
ContestOfChampions,3d6h6z,Obliwan,3,Tue Jul 14 04:20:02 2015 UTC,"There are a LOT of small optimizations that would reduce the time it seems to be taking you. As a comparison I'll make my estimates for getting the milestone and hero in the 3* arena:  First: Make sure you get your infinite streak started, having to build up you streak each time means you lose ~3 matches every 14 from building up the streak, not to mention the lost fights where you only win 2/3 fights. An infinite streak is not that hard to get, just make sure you get past 15 wins and all your fights will be against lower PI, but slightly quicker teams. Easy to get used to and you will rarely lose any fight, let alone the streak.  2nd, you can level up your champs so they get more points. I have 10 teams and never had trouble getting enough points with mostly 2/1 heroes that give me ~450 per match (before multiplier). If you max your champs though you will get 600-650/match. That might be good enough to compensate for not having 10 teams, but only 8.  3rd: practise you combats, not just to win more easily, but also to complete them quicker. 8 teams should not be taking you 40 minutes. With 10 teams one cycle through them takes me ~30. It doesn't sound like that big of a difference, but it is around a 30% time increase.  Overall, I think that if you play more efficiently your total time should be closer to 2 hours / day, spread across 4-5 rounds -> 6,5-8,5 hours (at least one of your cooldowns is likely to be while you sleep or do other things).  tl;dr Play smarter, not harder."
ContestOfChampions,3d6h6z,skcih,1 point,Mon Jul 13 23:57:32 2015 UTC,there's no way it takes you about 30 minutes to get through 30 fights and all the pre-post fight loadouts and animations. My 9 teams takes me between 45 and 70 minutes depending on if I'm focusing or not.
ContestOfChampions,3d6h6z,Obliwan,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:12:49 2015 UTC,"Well, I think my fights are more or less ~30 second fight and 30 second loading screens and reward screens. I'll try to properly time it sometime, but the matches I timed on a regular clock were all below 3 minutes."
ContestOfChampions,3d6h6z,sombrerofrog,1 point,Wed Jul 15 01:33:59 2015 UTC,Like obliwan said in the replies. It s more important to make your playtime count. From your point of view evrything you said might be right but here's what my case is. Exactly like you i have downloaded and started the game in spring but really i started playing 2 months ago or maybe 1 and a half month. And it has been 2 weeks since i started grinding and giving so much time away from my life and it seems tiring. But the key to earning points in arena is the infinite streak. I also had 8 teams i recently made it 9. The thing is i fpcused on leveling my 2 s instead of 3*s adter i reached thanos and now i have 8 trams all at least in rank2 and most in 2/20. If you focus ehile fighting and improve your combat skills simply by practice( natural) and not eat a 4 streak combo in your face in critical moments; you get a champ and you can (kinda) focus on some things in your daily life too. Personally i have no social life but i have hobbies and 2-3 days ago i figured this way to balance the time i spend for this game with my usual life
ContestOfChampions,3d6h6z,cruise02,1 point,Tue Jul 14 01:59:00 2015 UTC,I forgot to say the şnfinite streak is achievable if you play with your champions that can beat rank3/30 s only after you get to say 10 streak. So team up your champs according to synergies and focus leveling one team at a time.
ContestOfChampions,3d6h6z,knightzeemo,1 point,Tue Jul 14 02:01:17 2015 UTC,"If you don't want to spend too many hours grinding, I recommend playing the weekday arenas just for the milestone rewards and Crystal Cornucopia for the premium hero crystal rank rewards.

So yea, it's relatively wasting time if you can do hard. And don't pull random first run luck out your ass every day. Yay anecdotal luck vs chance and probabilities. Always fun having you."
ContestOfChampions,3d4q63,VeronicaLowe,1 point,Mon Jul 13 19:48:15 2015 UTC,So easy isn't even worth it then? I had not thought of it like that. If the draw is based solely on chests then it definitely is not worth it to do the easy side.
ContestOfChampions,3d4q63,VeronicaLowe,2,Mon Jul 13 22:13:38 2015 UTC,"Easy is only worth doing when on of two things are true: 1:You cant do hard side yet or cost too many potions 2:There's actually an exploration reward (basic t1,t3,and class t2)"
ContestOfChampions,3d4nk6,Obliwan,3,Mon Jul 13 14:20:16 2015 UTC,"tl;dr: If you haven't done so, get everything else to 100% completion before Thanos run, then try and see if you have enough revives/buffs/heals to do all 4 runs, if not, wait, otherwise, go for it :).  By finished you meant 100% completed? If not I'd suggest going for 100% completion on all others. It will give you a large amount of ISO to level up your guys while you collect enough heals and revives to go for Thanos. For Thanos himself your current team is probably a bit on the weak side. Your UC would have to do most (if not all) of the heavy lifting, which means a lot of heals and probably a few revives. The other reason to do the 100% completions first is that the reward for just doing Thanos once (a 3* and some ISO) is not that great, you can probably do without that for a while. What you really aim for is the 4*, so you want to avoid spending a LOT of revives/buffs/heals on your first run and then having to spend time collecting new ones before you can do the other 3 runs.  I finished everything at 100% before my first Thanos run and then decided to do all 4 paths in a row, and used heavy buffs to do so. I had a 1700~ duped 3* Iron fist and ~1600 duped 3* black panther that cleared a lot of champs before thanos. My main Thanos killer was a ~1600 4* colossus (I found him quite good vs Thanos). Other two team members were ~1k but provided synergies and small damage on Thanos. I used 0 revives in 4 runs, but did some healing (maybe 30-40 level 1 heals). I also used three buffs to put the 1600-1700's to ~2200-2300, which I think helped a lot."
ContestOfChampions,3d4nk6,Obliwan,1 point,Mon Jul 13 14:41:19 2015 UTC,UnfortunTely today i finished exploring evrything except thanos. I think i ll farm from dailys and Kang and when i get my scarlet witch and black panther maxed maybe i ll do it.
ContestOfChampions,3d4nk6,Bronx4me,1 point,Tue Jul 14 01:38:43 2015 UTC,"Probably having two maxed heroes will be good enough if you have a lot of regular healing left. You can always use the same guy over and over for all battles up to Thanos, so you have a full 5-man team at full HP for Thanos. Scarlet witch is very good against him (especially if duped), so if you have to revive someone, revive her against Thanos.  I did (almost) all battles up to Thanos with black panther and Iron first and just healed Iron fist back to max before fighting Thanos. I never actually used black panther on Thanos so didn't have to heal him back up and also don't know how good he works on Thanos."

By the time I did it (thinking there is no way I could take him) I beat him with 2 champions left to spare. Just farm health potions and revives (you can start a quest that has some and then leave but keep the potions) I went from not having beat him to beating him 4 times for 100 % completion in the same day.
ContestOfChampions,3d4nk6,VeronicaLowe,1 point,Mon Jul 13 14:52:22 2015 UTC,"I 100%ed the Thanos quest today (still have ~ one chapter left besides, did this so I finished it before they nerf Iron Fist), and I did it using not one single revive and over 400 potions left over. Saved them all for no reason lol. And twice I beat him using only Iron fist and UC. Thanos is a lot easier than he's made out to be."

And yeah, I get less crystals and less champs...but I've beaten Thanos several times over, so I don't NEED any new guys. Hell, its gonna take me forever to level up the ones I already have.  This realisation has been liberating. Now I can play here and there without any pressure to put up a quota of points. If I want to just play the Ant Man quests, I can. If I want to dip into Arena, I will. If I want to leave the game alone for a whole week, I just won't play.

ContestOfChampions,3d317i,Double___Dragon,6,Mon Jul 13 03:06:38 2015 UTC,"Personally I think Ms Marvel is the best cosmic champ, I know people like Gamora for her assassination and bleeds and such but with Ms Marvel's Sig ability to increase base atk dmg on how full your power meter is, is insane, especially when you mix it with Fury. And the fact that her damage is not relying on something that has to hit 100% of the time is nice too, it's just your auto attacks.  So very nice pull all together"
ContestOfChampions,3d317i,Biinarii,4,Mon Jul 13 04:49:28 2015 UTC,"Compared to Captain Marvel she has better Fury (60% at max rank vs 45%, for a 3*) and also different synergies. She also seems to have a very high crit rate compared to other champions but that is hard to verify. I think other than that her attack and health are the same as Captain Marvel (which are already very high)."
ContestOfChampions,3d317i,noamto,1 point,Mon Jul 13 07:42:20 2015 UTC,These are all things I'm noticing as well. When I beat a duped 4* 2 and 1/2 times my Pi I knew it was a great pull.
ContestOfChampions,3d317i,thedukeoftank,2,Mon Jul 13 12:39:55 2015 UTC,"Just duped my 4* Captain Marvel yesterday on a Premium Crystal.  Honestly, didn't really think much of the character until she was duped. Now she hits quite a bit harder, gets an attack bonus from stored energy and has energy absorption when blocking. Extremely useful against quite a few champs out there.    Just for reference, here are the two duped abilities:    Captain Marvel: ENERGY ABSORPTION-Attack is increased up to 47.4% based on stored Power. In addition, blocking partially absorbs energy-based attacks, fueling Captain Marvel's Power Meter.    Ms. Marvel: Attack is increased up to 47.4% based on stored Power. In addition, blocking partially absorbs energy-based attacks, fueling Ms. Marvel's Power Meter.    Still like Gamora better though ... Can't beat a 3* doing 5k+ damage on a L1 attack."
ContestOfChampions,3d317i,Thekobra,1 point,Mon Jul 13 14:12:37 2015 UTC,"That's a great summary. I think I'd still have Gamora and Thor in the top tier, but I'd put Marvel close behind and above Black Bolt from what I've experienced. I've heard her L2 is one of the best in the game when paired with Fury."
ContestOfChampions,3d317i,turbotchuck,4,Mon Jul 13 15:18:22 2015 UTC,"Well I still don't have Captain Marvel, so I can't compare. But Ms Marvel is awesome. Love playing with her. Congrats on the pull!"

If the content of the crystal is in our mobiles, it would be possible to find/hack a way to pick whatever we want. So, when you open a crystal, the outcome is already on Kabam's servers. We just use the interface and the fighting, the rest is server-side. It doesn't answer your question, but since the outcome depends on Kabam's servers, I think it doesn't matter the result of openning/spinning, it's probably the same."

For example, each arena crystal may have 25% chance of gold when opened one at atime, but 30% chance of gold when opened 5 at a time. Maybe not but sure seems that way."
ContestOfChampions,3d0gus,menkent,1 point,Sun Jul 12 23:50:20 2015 UTC,If it did they would advertise it so people would buy credits to get that extra crystal or two for a five or ten spin. Always remember that the game is designed to maximize kabam's profit margin.   It doesn't matter. It just seems better because you're getting five at once.

With the introduction of a 4* at 2m points, many players are going to redistribute their time to grind for the 4* milestone instead of chasing the 3*.

ContestOfChampions,3d2beg,dagibcollecta,2,Mon Jul 13 00:09:19 2015 UTC,"Thx dagibcollecta. One thing that is not clear is the battlegroups. Each group play appart from the others, I assume, but its against the same enemies or is there any difference? How about difficulty: does it increase or decrease based on your alliance/battlegroup strengh? Heard so, but how? And is it dynamic? Can i clean part of the road along with 3 other players, for instance, and then the others jump in? Or when it starts, whoever is out stays out?"
ContestOfChampions,3d2beg,dagibcollecta,2,Mon Jul 13 01:39:34 2015 UTC,"First off, the brackets are broken up into alliance prestige.  Your personal prestige is made up of your top three champion PI, then it determines alliance prestige off that.   You have 3 battlegrounds of 10 members each, so you need all 30 members.   They don't all have to join at same time, theoretically you could 100% it and someone can still join if there's an open slot.  The quest map is massive, similar to all other ultron quests.  You get 5 energy, and repopulate one energy per hour each.  There will be multiple paths all which you will need to go through, as some champions need to be cleared to remove a boost to a boss or another champ on another path your teammates are on, and vice versa.  It seems there are 3 phases to the quest, each having a boss, for example a juggernaut of 6000 Pi.  There are orange nodes that have boosts no matter what, you'll have to clear them for all to proceed to next phase.  I don't know if difficulty changes per alliance, but all three battle groups are same difficulty.   The main goal is to have PATIENCE, have a strategy leader for each group, and use teamwork to keep your champs alive, there's no need to Rambo as you will K.O. All your champs this way and the revives and heals are expensive for these events.  You're given a team revive to revive 350hp to all champs and two potions to heal 150.   If you buy others, you're gonna spend 100-300 units per heal or revive.  However, if you slow it down and do it right, you don't need heals or revives.  I will try to post more info soon, screenshots as well"

ContestOfChampions,3czxab,chaddaddycwizzie,1 point,Sun Jul 12 11:42:22 2015 UTC,I have it upgraded all the way. It is useful only if you are a defensive player .. which I am.  If you are more aggressive then go for the offensive masteries.. they will prove much more useful.  Just wanted to say this... My 2 * wolverine is duped way too many times and is maxed out.. that combined with salve makes him immortal.
ContestOfChampions,3czxab,le_me,1 point,Sun Jul 12 09:57:12 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'm more offensive, so i thought this would help more as I wouldn't have to worry about blocking. So is the bottom line not worth it?"
ContestOfChampions,3czxab,le_me,1 point,Sun Jul 12 14:03:11 2015 UTC,"Salve will not replace blocking for you. It gives you that extra 10% juice (if you are maxed out) or more if you are not maxed out -  that enables you to carve out a win in tight situations.  For example, I am a defensive player that mostly blocks and unleashes special attacks. Blocking an incoming attack greatly reduces its damage to the extent that salve helps by patching you up again.  If you were to go all guns blazing with no blocking then salve wont do jack shit against a crit hit or a special that you end up eating."
ContestOfChampions,3czxab,VeronicaLowe,1 point,Sun Jul 12 15:41:16 2015 UTC,Nope.
ContestOfChampions,3czxab,Double___Dragon,1 point,Sun Jul 12 17:49:54 2015 UTC,"I'm a fairly offensive player, and I have it upgraded all the way. It replenishes 8 health/second. Even in fights that last only a minute long, you're getting an extra 480 HP in that span. I almost never block, and I think it gives me the edge in almost all fights - ESPECIALLY with the 2* arena."
ContestOfChampions,3czxab,LambentPanda,1 point,Sun Jul 12 18:01:03 2015 UTC,"Honestly I think it depends. Basically I think that this is one of those skills that is good up to a certain point in the game. If youre still in Act one then this skill can definitely help keep your champions alive quite well. Because it only does regenerate 8 health per second for a minute it starts becoming obsolete when you start getting to the point where youre using 3* and 4* champs. So if your main priority is still act one and probably a bit into act 2 also and youre still trying to focus on the 2* arena to get those 3* champs then Id say its worth it to get it.  As for cost I dont think its that expensive really. All you need to do is complete the Ant-Man Act 1 to get one of the canisters and buy the other for 135 units. As for leveling it up, if i remember correctly it will only be about another 50 units or so to get it to the max.   Hope this helps !"

Currently at rank 1 level 10, I can't say how many rank 5 level 50 champs she's beaten, most of whom were actually other Black Widows. If you're using her as a three or four star, pair her with Hulk. That will give everybody a chance to stun on specials, which can be amazingly helpful (getting bleed, power drain, and stun on Hawkeye's L1 is just fucking ridiculous). I like to refer to her as the Queen of Critical Hits. Obviously, critical rate and damage are her strong suits, which I think makes her the best female critical hitter. How well you do with her depends on your ""skill level"", so to speak. If you're more of an active player, dodging and dashing and blocking and attacking as much as possible, she should do wonders for you. If you're passive, however, just mindlessly blocking and attacking, you're screwed. If you're having trouble with her, try saving up power for her second special, spamming basic attacks, then going straight into her first special. She can get both a post to her. critical rate and damage on either one, so they both work just fine. Stay away from her third special, though, unless you really want to stun your enemy. A good 3v3 team for her is Hulk, Hawkeye, and herself. She has boosts for both of them, and they have boosts for each other. Let me know if this helped, hopefully I can give you some more pointers if needed! EDIT: I forgot to mention: EVADE! Her evade makes her even more amazing, and when you play as her you can't even tell it's a 3% chance (which doesn't go up per rank or tier, by the way). I swear, it feels like she evades hits like 25% of the time. If that doesn't convince you, I don't know what will."

ContestOfChampions,3cz3q5,dagibcollecta,1 point,Sun Jul 12 02:58:03 2015 UTC,"This is it ^  My preference is hulk, bw, Thor or hulkbuster combo.  Her L2 can do 6000-8000 damage alone.  It's insane."
ContestOfChampions,3cz3q5,Thekobra,0,Sun Jul 12 04:01:48 2015 UTC,"When does the stun come into effect? I've got my 3* and 4* BW on the same team with hulk, showing 20% and 25% chance for stun, for a total of 45% chance for stun, and I haven't stunned anyone in like two days of playing?"
ContestOfChampions,3cz3q5,knightzeemo,1 point,Fri Jul 17 10:34:27 2015 UTC,"She definitely doesn't have a ton of health, so you need to be more careful with her, kinda like Electro or Rocket. But she its hard. Her L2 lands a ton of criticals and does a lot of damage. Against the harder AI, it's tough to land, so I usually just wait for the L3. It does decent damage, but has a high stun rate. Plus she'll have a critical boost and the stun is pretty long. Opponents rarely survive that stun. Just work on your dodging/blocking and you'll do well with her.   If you have a Hulk to pair her with, the stun synergy offered is the best one in the game. I'm dying to get a Hulk to pair with her."
ContestOfChampions,3cz3q5,Qoptop,1 point,Sun Jul 12 05:26:00 2015 UTC,Does this stun synergy works with 2☆ version of BW and hulk?
ContestOfChampions,3cz3q5,cjy7877,1 point,Sun Jul 12 06:52:46 2015 UTC,"Her L2 does seriously insane damage, and her following attacks after that are crazy too because of the buffs on her.

ContestOfChampions,3cz3q5,Qoptop,1 point,Sun Jul 12 05:51:01 2015 UTC,"Her signature ability has a chance to ""suppress"" the enemy's sig when she attacks.

ContestOfChampions,3cxg04,knightzeemo,2,Sat Jul 11 19:04:28 2015 UTC,Yes especially when they made tonnes of money from this game. And the arenas system omg. That should be based on level and how hard the players play instead of how long have they played this game. And as a new player fighting against level 40-50 with OP pierce and healing per second masteries is ridiculous. Not to mention that i need to play for nonstop for 3days to get to that 1000 spot. I feel like this game is not noob-friendly enough.
ContestOfChampions,3cxg04,cjy7877,2,Sat Jul 11 20:00:28 2015 UTC,"The arena system is even more ridiculous since the last update. Suddenly at a 5-6 win streak I'm losing it and restarting because I'm facing exactly what you just described. I really wish they'd find a way for auto-play to be introduced especially because of the grind factor of it all.

Making it more possible to beat ridiculous match ups. this would require an overhaul to fighting, though, so not sure if this is reasonable.  The ability to jump. If someone has a ranged attack, and they are higher level, even if you can get them to use up their powers on L1 and L2, which is hard enough, you still die."

I understand it's less to work with on these devices compared to consoles or pc's, but they could try utilizing circumstances where an enemy's L3 isn't guaranteed to kill you, where they allow you the chance to get away from it or reduce damage dramatically through mashing certain buttons that pop up or whatever comes to mind. This part is open to many suggestions that I may not be the best to offer however."

ContestOfChampions,3cxg04,Quiwundi,6,Sun Jul 12 16:55:37 2015 UTC,I've always wondered: if health persists in story quests why doesn't special level? Like if I have an L3 saved up for the boss why doesn't it stay there? Instead it resets to zero. That's kind of lame.

ContestOfChampions,3cwmai,Thekobra,4,Sat Jul 11 18:31:30 2015 UTC,I'm certain that the help all is only help 4 to space out the server hits. Help all sends all that info to servers all at once. Help 4 spaces it out a bit. Kinda like the entrance ramp to an expressway having a red/green light during rush out. Letting 30 cars on at once just slows everything down.
ContestOfChampions,3cwmai,cargopantstotheopera,2,Sat Jul 11 18:55:02 2015 UTC,"On the other hand, 'help all' would be like one bus compared to 30 cars. One big piece of data in a network enviroment is preferable to 30 fragments."
ContestOfChampions,3cwmai,t0talnonsense,1 point,Sat Jul 11 20:14:30 2015 UTC,"When the help function was first introduced, you are able to ""help all."" It was horrendously slow.

I just wish we could get a similar option to the ""help 4,"" when we are asking for help. Maybe ""ask for helping this row,"" or something to that effect. I think the problem with implementing something like that is how to make it work within the UI. Off hand, I can't think of a way to make that intuitive in the current layout and UI for arenas, which is probably the major reason it hasn't been implemented. That feature alone likely requires a UI redesign. And if you are going to redesign something as fundamental as that, there are a lot of other changes and aspects to consider. It's not a simple fix."

If you go back to the ""rewards"" tab and click on Rank Rewards, you'll see that the top 15 alliances get an alpha catalyst and five tier three basics, and there are even more rewards after that."
ContestOfChampions,3cur7z,SomDonkus,0,Fri Jul 10 23:09:14 2015 UTC,he means for the beta testers. They aren't getting the rewards.

ContestOfChampions,3cur7z,BlueCop,1 point,Sat Jul 11 15:48:50 2015 UTC,These are the screens he says pause to read.  START: The Leader and Officers can start a quest. Donate to the Alliance Treasury to help pay the starting cost!  BATTLEGROUP: Alliance members are split into Battlegroups. Select a Battlegroup carefully; you can't change once you choose one!  QUEST: Battle enemies to earn points for your Alliance. Defeat special enemies to remove boosts from other bosses!  REWARD: Earn as many points as you can! Compete against other Alliances for rank rewards at the end of the event.  OVERVIEW: Co-operate with your Alliance on a quest! Use strategy and fight to earn score for fantastic rewards!
ContestOfChampions,3cur7z,SirMonkeyWaffles,1 point,Fri Jul 10 23:18:17 2015 UTC,The extra buffs you see are being provided by other Champions.   You can tap on a button that brings up a view that shows how enemies are linked together. If you defeat an enemy that was feeding a buff to others then the other enemies get weaker.   So far I'm liking this quest mode. There's a bit of strategy involved to make it easier as you go. Hopefully my Alliance can get to Ultron before the quest ends.
ContestOfChampions,3cur7z,dillpatriot,1 point,Fri Jul 10 23:20:40 2015 UTC,My alliance doesnt have this
ContestOfChampions,3cur7z,ChillFactory,1 point,Sat Jul 11 00:02:00 2015 UTC,Its only in select alliances at the moment
ContestOfChampions,3cur7z,Afiq3688,1 point,Sat Jul 11 03:26:46 2015 UTC,I really enjoy this Alliance Quest. But you really need to communicate with all members and everyone must participate. This is by far the best thing kabam did in this game. Haha
ContestOfChampions,3cur7z,Honkifuluvhoez,1 point,Sat Jul 11 03:00:06 2015 UTC,"Hmmm. So not every alliance can ""do this"" right now? Is it based on where you're located or rank? We're at 1.3 million...wonder what the situation is. Looks pretty cool though, thanks for the update !"
ContestOfChampions,3cur7z,Monkey9712,1 point,Sat Jul 11 13:50:58 2015 UTC,The alliance quests are great as long as you have a competent alliance. We're currently ranked approximately 400k in alliance rating and have been able to take turns smashing on Ultron at the end which is pretty awesome
ContestOfChampions,3cuyoy,CrystalPolice,9,Sat Jul 11 00:05:02 2015 UTC,The rewards aren't even good.  Crystal Rush has no good rewards and draw duplicates can be achieved by just a few players saving up premiums and 3 star crystals.
ContestOfChampions,3cuyoy,Girafarigno,2,Sat Jul 11 00:39:34 2015 UTC,"I get the impression that if OP's alliance was getting those rewards from ""a few players saving up"", they wouldn't be after people to wait to open them. I suspect that their alliance is like mine, and barely ever completes an alliance event. In this case, it makes a lot of sense to complain about, because if people would just save their crystals for 2 days, we'd all have an extra crystal."
ContestOfChampions,3cuyoy,ductyl,21,Mon Jul 13 20:49:17 2015 UTC,"Don't you think you're taking this game way too serious?   I started taking screen shots of every alliance member's profiles in the morning to document their # of heroes/ratings and looking at the alliance logs on non-crystal or dupe days to see what crystals have been opened   This is too much ... they open crystals because it's fun opening crystals, not like they open crystals on all days other than dupe day/crystal day.  You sound like these people are the worst kind alive, when they're probably just trying to enjoy the game."
ContestOfChampions,3cuyoy,SouthM,2,Sat Jul 11 00:20:02 2015 UTC,"Currently the only benefit to being in an alliance is a separate chat and the rewards you get from alliance events. If you're unwilling to wait a couple days to open a crystal when it will benefit the alliance because it's ""just a game"", then you can probably drop out of the alliance and open all the crystals you want. Free up your spot in the ""group rewards for group effort"" team so that someone who will put in the effort can get the rewards."
ContestOfChampions,3cuyoy,ductyl,2,Mon Jul 13 20:47:55 2015 UTC,Wanna know what's more satisfying than opening crystals as you get them? Dropping your 30+ hero Crystal load at one time
ContestOfChampions,3cuyoy,chaddaddycwizzie,2,Sat Jul 11 08:49:36 2015 UTC,"This is why I love the alliance I'm in. Our rating is around 800k and everyone is pretty active. No one cares about opening crystals, especially now that the 3* milestone was removed from events. Our leader says to have fun, its a game not a job. They only care that you make an effort to contribute on the multi day events."
ContestOfChampions,3cuyoy,rockstar323,1 point,Sat Jul 11 12:48:51 2015 UTC,"Bro, we know it's fun opening crystals but not waiting for 2-3 days is just impatience and it's also bad for you(missing a prize) if you cannot wait for 2-3 days just stop being in the alliamce and make room for people who take this game ""too seriously"". I think the hours spent into this game are enough of a reason to be serious. Also, the purpose and all the fun of having an alliance and doing events is being coordinated and suddenly opening all the crustals and seeing the prizes come to you. OP i think the best solution for this problem is that kabam expose the number of all the crystals you opened in your profile, type by type. Or maybe just expose the name of people who get 3-4 stars"
ContestOfChampions,3cuyoy,chaddaddycwizzie,0,Sat Jul 11 00:51:52 2015 UTC,"Agreed. I hate seeing people in my alliance opening hero crystals all the time even after I suggest we save them for dupe day, and only one person (if that) in the alliance is more active in arenas than me"
ContestOfChampions,3cuyoy,VeronicaLowe,1 point,Sat Jul 11 07:08:47 2015 UTC,"They can enjoy the game in an alliance full of crystal openers and just accept that they wont win crystal or dupe events, then."
ContestOfChampions,3cuyoy,Faru36,0,Sat Jul 11 00:30:11 2015 UTC,"You also fail to realize that if players aren't saving their crystals, whenever a 3-day event comes by, that's a ton of points lost for the 3-day event and a very high chance of the alliance not getting the alpha reward, let alone ranking rewards. So yeah, I agree with the OP, there's got to be a way to see who is opening what, and at the least, see the names of people who are getting 3/4 champions instead of it just saying, 'an aliance member'."
ContestOfChampions,3cuyoy,xenithflare,-4,Sat Jul 11 00:47:39 2015 UTC,"Too serious? This is nothing compared to the effort to rank in the Top 100 of an individual or alliance arena.  Alliances are about group effort. If someone slacked on arena events, they'd be kicked because it's well-documented who put up points and who didn't.  Players figure they can skate because who opens what isn't documented by name, and they can put up something on dupe/crystal day figuring no one will know about all the crystals they wasted."
ContestOfChampions,3cuyoy,ductyl,5,Sat Jul 11 00:29:51 2015 UTC,"A lot of high-ranked players and alliances know that you should save minimums for certain events, and everything beyond that is gravy. So you may see people opening four, five crystals at once during a useless event, but you don't know how many they have saved. I could open ten PHCs right now and still have 20 left over, 20k worth of points not counting any other high-value crystals I still have.    When you're saving sometimes you just want to open a few things for that sweet, sweet dupe ISO from time to time."
ContestOfChampions,3cuyoy,xenithflare,1 point,Sat Jul 11 03:05:31 2015 UTC,"Right, but if your alliance is hitting the milestones consistently, I doubt your members are complaining about people opening crystals early. This is more of a problem for alliances that consistently aren't hitting all the milestones."
ContestOfChampions,3cuyoy,chaddaddycwizzie,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:51:06 2015 UTC,"We usually struggle to hit the final one in the multi-day events, but everyone's initial reaction is to outcry at people opening things off-event. We've had a long discussion about how Hitler-esque we're going to be about it, and the final answer was not to worry so long as a minimum is maintained. So far we have most of our members onboard, but the main goal was not to turn our alliance into a witch hunt."
ContestOfChampions,3cuyoy,xenithflare,-2,Tue Jul 14 02:16:44 2015 UTC,Ok but if that's the case that they are still saving the majority of their crystals they better still be going crazy on dupe day
ContestOfChampions,3cuyoy,ductyl,2,Sat Jul 11 08:51:03 2015 UTC,"My alliance is good, but far from the best, and we still manage to max dupe day within the first hour with people opening crystals all throughout the week. At some point you have to sit back and relax and realize the small daily events are going to get done on their own time. If you have a small, sub-200k alliance then yeah you need to work on communication first and goals second."
ContestOfChampions,3cuyoy,xenithflare,2,Sat Jul 11 13:54:28 2015 UTC,"My alliance is also over 300k and we very rarely max out the dupe day event, and the problem described in the OP is rampant, as soon as we get a PC as an event reward, the log is flooded with people getting new champs from PCs, despite instructions to wait to open them."
ContestOfChampions,3cuyoy,chaddaddycwizzie,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:54:36 2015 UTC,"That's what I'm talking about: if you have members that aren't talking and aren't on board with the alliances' goals, then they should be replaced with people who are. We went through quite a few people over that last several weeks, and now our team is incredibly well-coordinated."
ContestOfChampions,3cuyoy,xenithflare,1 point,Tue Jul 14 02:20:14 2015 UTC,"That's still better than a lot of alliances can say. If that's the case for your alliance the comment doesn't really apply to you or your alliance. I'm in almost a 300k alliance and we can't max that stuff out. But then again there's some like the rank up going on now with a rank award, so in the long run I don't think it hurts to hold out.  if you are holding out on hero crystals and you need more champs for arenas or you can't progress further in the story without a better team that's somewhat more understandable. Still if it's for story you're relying on the small chance you get a champ that is better or has better potential than your current champs so that can require opening a lot."
ContestOfChampions,3cuyoy,chaddaddycwizzie,2,Sat Jul 11 18:39:06 2015 UTC,"The multi-day crystal/rank up events are a whole different beast altogether. That's why I mentioned having a minimum number saved per person, which requires communication. If half your team isn't buying in and that's causing you to not finish various events, then communication is where the effort needs to be focused instead of lambasting people about their usage habits.    I'm not trying to sound pretentious, but I've come from alliances where they hover around 200k and that was the problem I always saw. My current one is about 650k and the difference between the attitude and communication from the old ones are night and day. Yeah, opening a crystal or three is potential points that could make the multi-day events easier, but if they have 40 saved up that person can't be held responsible for the rest of the teams failure to do the same."
ContestOfChampions,3cuyoy,nimrod1138,1 point,Sat Jul 11 19:21:03 2015 UTC,"I don't think that sounds pretentious at all I think that is all entirely reasonable. I definitely agree they should work on communicating with each other rather than kick people, but I think a big reason people get kicked is that no one can get through to them. I mention how I think people should do stuff in clan chat, so it can be frustrating when people don't listen.  Clan leaders see this and decide maybe they are better off looking for someone who will communicate and contribute to the team."
ContestOfChampions,3cuyoy,ajm74,8,Sat Jul 11 22:12:10 2015 UTC,"It's a little hardcore to take screenshots, but I agree that it's really frustrating when people open hero crystals or rank big guys on off days, especially when on the event days we struggle to reach the last event milestones. Or worst, then a 3-day event starts up and it's hard to get going because no one has anything.  Kabam really needs to start setting the 3-day events on a certain cycle, like the 1 day events, so we know what's coming and plan accordingly."
ContestOfChampions,3cuyoy,Dace14,5,Sat Jul 11 01:07:38 2015 UTC,"As for ranking up out of turn...  we decided in our alliance that as long as you save the 3-star 3rd and 4th ranks and ALL 4-star ranks for Rank Up day, you can rank all you want otherwise.  Haven't missed a prize yet."
ContestOfChampions,3cuyoy,LegoBobaFett,10,Sat Jul 11 00:34:04 2015 UTC,"This sort of thing is what makes me not want to join an alliance, even though i save my crystals anyway and am pretty active joining an alliance seems like it will suck the fun out of it"
ContestOfChampions,3cuyoy,Dace14,4,Sat Jul 11 01:45:26 2015 UTC,"If you already save your crystals, and can wait to rank up your guys for the event days, I HIGHLY suggest you join an alliance. The rewards are too good to be passing up.   Go to the subreddit linked in the sidebar and find an alliance that is relaxed or casual and you can just test it out. If they kick you out for being inactive then who cares, you didn't want to really join one in the first place.   But getting 3-5 extra premium hero crystals every week, and alliance crystals, and class iso and boosts and so on is a lot of fun and helps you get further, faster.   This is just my opinion, but you should at least try it out."
ContestOfChampions,3cuyoy,Rantmachine,1 point,Sat Jul 11 02:34:49 2015 UTC,"I can honestly see the benefits of joining one but i have not for a couple of reasons. One being what i said in my first comment about it being too serious and having the fun sucked out of it, not much point in making a commitment to a casual alliance and being kicked out for not being active enough, just seems like a waste of time for everyone involved. The second is that if i join one and am not very active im letting other players down  that im supposed to be helping which is unfair on those people that are active in the alliance. For now im content with going solo, ive done a decent job so far i feel, my reddit user name is the same as my COC one so feel free to tell me what you think"

ContestOfChampions,3cuyoy,meandizzle,4,Sun Jul 12 06:01:40 2015 UTC,"The way I see it, being in an alliance is about working together for the common good of all. How seriously everyone wants to take it is really up to the group but my take is, if you want to just do your own damn thing, that's fine! Just don't bitch when you get kicked for not being part of the team. No one should expect to reap the benefits of those who contribute to events without giving a shit about events themselves."
ContestOfChampions,3cuyoy,longlivethejeriot,3,Sat Jul 11 05:00:45 2015 UTC,"Legit. It shows the most when 3 day events roll,around and those people are at the bottom of the scoreboards and wonder why they're the first ones kicked. It's about the whole. It's an ALLiance.  Not a MElliance."
ContestOfChampions,3cuyoy,Thekobra,1 point,Sat Jul 11 16:00:19 2015 UTC,"I loved my old alliance. We kicked ass. However, they started to get super competitive, more than I knew I could keep up with. So I bowed out on good terms. I joined a casual alliance where we're happy to earn whatever we get and we do end up getting some decent milestones. It's nice. Point is though, no one likes a moocher!"
ContestOfChampions,3cuyoy,grathan,9,Sun Jul 12 06:07:26 2015 UTC,"I think the better question is why do you still care so much? Even when they gave out the 3* crystal, we didn't require that you save them all. I'm in my second alliance and none of them have ever missed the final milestone.   Totally unnecessary to even bother. And if you want to run your alliance like a dictator, then give people a dupe day minimum. If they don't hit, they are gone. Simple as that."
ContestOfChampions,3cuyoy,skreddy56,3,Sat Jul 11 02:56:15 2015 UTC,What about a free alpha cat as a reward for just a little patience?
ContestOfChampions,3cuyoy,SomDonkus,2,Sat Jul 11 21:21:08 2015 UTC,"Don't stress out: set minimum point goals in events and ""disinvite"" members who don't hit them. Worrying all week about who's opening crystals will give you an ulcer.  We have a member who spends crazy money on the game, buying 4-star crystal offers whenever they come up. Is he selling us out by opening it straightaway? My outlook is that I don't really have a say over how he enjoys spending his cash, and he's there for us in the events, so why worry?"
ContestOfChampions,3cuyoy,ductyl,3,Sat Jul 11 01:53:07 2015 UTC,This is the biggest downside to alliances for me. Are you really going to tell people how to enjoy their MOBILE GAME? So I opened one premium crystal out of the 30 I have and got lucky with a 3. Are you going to kick me for that? Or I ranked up my 3 that I just got to rank 2. Am I banned? It's ridiculous. It takes nothing to achieve all those milestones. My alliance finishes in like 30 minutes yet still they always kinda harp on us to save. I'm saving all my crystals for a week long event though.
ContestOfChampions,3cuyoy,y2j_lionsault,2,Sat Jul 11 14:01:56 2015 UTC,"If you hit all the milestones, I agree it's silly to worry about it. My alliance almost never hits the top milestones, and yet tons of people open their crystals as soon as they get them. Including the ones that are rewards for alliance quests... milestones that some of us spent extra units to earn the reward for the whole alliance... and then they ignore the instructions to wait until the next dupe event to open.. that's my issue. If we hit the goals, I wouldn't care, but there are so many people just mooching off the effort of people who do."

One of those events is the ""Draw Duplicates"" event. If you open all your crystals as soon as you get them, the only way you'll get duplicates in the ""Draw Duplicates"" event is if you get new crystals on that day. If instead you save your crystals for the 4 days between the ""Draw Duplicates"" events, you'll have 5 days worth of crystals to open, which greatly increase your chances of drawing duplicates, and if your whole team does this, it results in your whole team getting additional Premium Crystals as prizes."

ContestOfChampions,3cuyoy,DIGITALOGIK,1 point,Sat Jul 11 12:28:59 2015 UTC,"Which is fine, as long as you're not in an alliance where other people care about it. If you're in an alliance where other people exercise self control and restraint in order to benefit the whole team, and you're just pulling in the rewards of that, that's when I see it as an issue."
ContestOfChampions,3cuyoy,WitchBxtchOfficial,1 point,Mon Jul 13 21:01:43 2015 UTC,And I thought maybe I was taking the game too serious with my macro-galore spreadsheet for my champions.
ContestOfChampions,3cuyoy,ajm74,1 point,Sat Jul 11 00:47:35 2015 UTC,"We have a spreadsheet, where everyone enters their amount of crystals and then, we get the amount of points, and as long as you pass 150k, you can open whatever you want (even though that is also a waste) but at least we make sure that the 4.5 million milestone is reached. We do not open for the beyond shitty crystal events (which is most of them thanks to Kabam.) This saves us some headache."
ContestOfChampions,3cuyoy,IBringUTheGiftOfPain,0,Sat Jul 11 01:06:11 2015 UTC,"And for the record, my only exception is that I will burn some Battle Chips if I need gold for Arenas or to Rank Up my heroes during the Rank Up event.  It was hard to start waiting at first--I get it--but after I held out for a bit it got really easy."
ContestOfChampions,3cuyoy,VeronicaLowe,2,Sat Jul 11 00:16:37 2015 UTC,"It's selfishness, nothing more.  We caught a guy in our alliance and he told us (I assume with a straight face) ""I carried this alliance for the first month, I can do what I want to try and stay interested in this game.""   The only time I don't have a huge issue with it is if the crystals were bought with units, but that's easy to lie about, and really not much of an excuse for waiting at most 96 hours to open them."
ContestOfChampions,3cuyoy,chaddaddycwizzie,0,Sat Jul 11 00:32:20 2015 UTC,"My question to you is: do you only fight in Arenas when the Arena Wins Event is active? Honestly I don't think it matters when anyone opens THEIR crystals, especially 3 and 4 star crystals from quests. I will say that crystals that are retrieved from Alliance events, can be expected to be saved for other events. But honestly you can't expect people to save crystals they've worked hard for.  TL,DR: Crystals gained from Alliance events should be used for the good of the alliance, crystals players work for aren't your business."

ContestOfChampions,3cu09s,SomDonkus,4,Fri Jul 10 19:52:57 2015 UTC,Are you sure about that? They already gave some people things by accident in the past and then took them back.
ContestOfChampions,3cu09s,noamto,2,Fri Jul 10 20:24:20 2015 UTC,"Of course he isn't sure about that, but in some cases it will be awfully difficult to take them back. What if that player already used ISO and Catalysts on the extra champ? Or what if that extra 4* was a dupe and they already spent the bonus ISO/gold? I think it's complicated enough that they probably won't bother taking anything back.   That said, you are correct, they've done it in the past so it's possible here too. Since they didn't mention anything about it, I think those players are safe."

ContestOfChampions,3cuxvg,slumpsox,1 point,Sat Jul 11 03:21:06 2015 UTC,This needs more explanation... Why would  a high up mastery exist to the players' detriment?
ContestOfChampions,3cuxvg,Double___Dragon,3,Sat Jul 11 04:02:41 2015 UTC,Sorry if I wasn't clear. The 'Parry' mastery reads:   Activating block when attacked reduces damage by 20/25/30% and inflicts Stun for up to 1.5/1.7/2.0 second(s) based on Perfect Block Chance   The opponent has the mastery and when I hit him while he's blocking I get stunned. I consider this self-stun since I'm the one who initiated the attack.
ContestOfChampions,3cuxvg,Thekobra,3,Sat Jul 11 05:14:46 2015 UTC,"Based on what it says, the stun should be based on perfect block, not the duration like you mentioned above. That is crazy though.   Still, this is why the beta test these things first. Make sure you let Kabam know somehow."
ContestOfChampions,3cuxvg,Double___Dragon,2,Sat Jul 11 05:39:32 2015 UTC,Gotcha. So what you're saying is it's a really good mastery. I think yellowjacket will have this in some form too.

ContestOfChampions,3cvpel,chaddaddycwizzie,9,Sat Jul 11 05:13:57 2015 UTC,I think he's cosmic because the Superior suit is Symbiote (think Venom & carnage) based.

Kabam just needs to find a middle ground so it's easier for the players but still rewards grind, which is exactly what they're trying to do. Just give them some time and put faith. They're a company and they want to keep their player base. It would be unreasonable to accuse them of just wanting $$$ since it doesn't benefit any party."

ContestOfChampions,3cti8a,subredditor41,2,Sat Jul 11 16:40:39 2015 UTC,found it:   We'll be running the Deadpool Arena again; some of you may remember this from when we ran in it February. Starting on Friday we'll be re-exposing the 3-Star Deadpool beginner offer to anyone who has not yet purchased it. Any player who has ever purchased the Deadpool 3-Star offer will then be eligible to participate in the 2 day Arena on Monday for a 4-Star Deadpool. 2 and 3-Star Deadpools will be available as Milestones.   http://community.kabam.com/forums/showthread.php?528093-Arena-and-Event-Feedback-7-8&highlight=deadpool+arena

ContestOfChampions,3cti8a,nimrod1138,1 point,Sat Jul 11 00:56:28 2015 UTC,"The offer I got included 300 units, 1500 Mutant ISO, and some gold.  That's a pretty fair deal for a guaranteed 3* hero"
ContestOfChampions,3cti8a,esteban42,2,Fri Jul 10 17:51:13 2015 UTC,"Personally I feel 3-5 would be a fair price for a specific hero, maybe 10 max to keep non-paying players in the running. 20 is an insult, although sadly more fair than their other pricing models..."
ContestOfChampions,3cti8a,xenithflare,2,Fri Jul 10 19:00:55 2015 UTC,"You realize that 3-5 is about the price of a premium crystal right? Where you have about a 10% of getting a 3* champ and no control over which one. You also won't get any ISO, units, or gold. This is one of the best offers in the game.   No offense, but if $20 is insulting to you, then you are not the target player for this game. Nothing wrong with that, but don't expect to see any offers that your impressed by."

ContestOfChampions,3cti8a,SoggyFrenchFry,1 point,Sat Jul 11 00:00:19 2015 UTC,"I did mention the price disparity at the end of my post, so I do realize that yes :P I'm just recalling fairly-priced DLC for mobile games being only a couple of dollars, and how that would likely lend itself to more money flowing for Kabam in the long run and not just the whales.    The $5 3* crystal was an amazing deal that no one should have passed on, and I feel like that's an excellent pricing model to go by. I don't expect them to change to that, but it would be very nice for everyone."
ContestOfChampions,3cti8a,xenithflare,1 point,Fri Jul 10 19:43:50 2015 UTC,"Fair enough.

ContestOfChampions,3cuass,C4NN1B41,3,Fri Jul 10 21:08:17 2015 UTC,Basically that.  With so few teams you're better off going for 3* champs  until you build a roster of about 10 3* teams
ContestOfChampions,3cuass,Ebonlyse,2,Fri Jul 10 22:06:53 2015 UTC,"It's not possible without units and your roster. If you can afford it, you can definitely get to 2M with the units and it should still be a lot less than the 2500 units a 4* crystal costs.  But your better off focusing on building your 3* roster and hoping the complainers to cause Kabam to remove this milestone."
ContestOfChampions,3cuass,Thekobra,1 point,Fri Jul 10 22:14:39 2015 UTC,For what reason would it need to b removed?
ContestOfChampions,3cuass,Thekobra,1 point,Sat Jul 11 02:54:55 2015 UTC,"Well, they were very clear in their post on the official forums that they are trying this out. Previously Kabam worried that a milestone would reduce the competition for rank awards. If that ends up to be true, we might see them go away. More specifically, if units spent decreases they might blame the milestone for causing people to be satisfied instead of spending to get as high as possible.   That forum is also filled with people complaining that the milestone is too high. They definitely tried this because so many people asked for it. If its costing money and not making players happier, then it's of zero benefit to Kabam.   I actually think they'll be happy with the results. I'm playing more and using more units than normal (though I'm doing fairly well so far, so not many units at all) to ensure I get to at least 2M. It's worked on me. We'll see if it stays."

I have all offense masteries as well and it's pretty rare I get KO'ed off a 3rd special. No mastery is really better than another because people have various play styles where one could be more beneficial than another. Also the champ you use is a major factor.

ContestOfChampions,3ct174,Thekobra,2,Fri Jul 10 19:32:56 2015 UTC,made that mistake today.  at 18 i used a regular team and got destroyed
ContestOfChampions,3ct174,Ebonlyse,1 point,Fri Jul 10 21:03:42 2015 UTC,"I just used a boost and I managed to get an infinite streak past 15. It became ""Easy"" after 15."
ContestOfChampions,3ct174,Qoptop,2,Sat Jul 11 02:19:30 2015 UTC,"Yes, it becomes ""easy"" after 15. But I've had numerous streaks ruined around 17/18 because I used a team of 1100+.  Those same teams give me no fits after 20, hence why I say TRUE easy starts after 20. Better safe than sorry."
ContestOfChampions,3ct174,rangers1024,1 point,Sat Jul 11 20:09:46 2015 UTC,"Ah, no wonder. I messed up with that last night. I was in streak 17 and it said easy, so I tried my team which added up to 3700 and they gave me a 10k team.  Although when I was on 22nd streak, I tried my 1800 team and they used a 10k team again, so I need to find the limit of how low your team can be once you get to easy."
ContestOfChampions,3ct174,Qoptop,1 point,Sat Jul 11 20:49:34 2015 UTC,"LOwest team I've used is around 3400. I try to make sure that I don't have more than 1 champ that is lower thank rank 3 (as a 3). SO even though a duped 3 rank 30 will be 1100++, I find using too many in one fight draws the bad match ups."
ContestOfChampions,3ct174,rangers1024,1 point,Sun Jul 12 01:47:42 2015 UTC,"I've been testing how low I can get, but it seems like a bad idea to go below 3k. The thing is, if I use all my teams (including my weak ones 300 PL champs), I make more or less the same amount as I do without the infinite streak. In one run, it's more or less 100k. I guess it'll pay off in the long run if I just level more 3* champs to 3/30."
ContestOfChampions,3ct174,Qoptop,1 point,Sun Jul 12 03:24:34 2015 UTC,"Yea, you get about the same. But you save time/run with the infinite streak."
ContestOfChampions,3ct174,rangers1024,1 point,Sun Jul 12 03:42:54 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's the upside for sure. Also a better investment in the future to keep leveling in 3*."
ContestOfChampions,3ct174,Qoptop,1 point,Sun Jul 12 03:58:53 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure what your character levels are but I typically do not have a problem with my 3/30 four star champs after 10, and sometimes my 4/40 three star champs. If I play more conservative I can typically get to the infinite streak about 90-95% of the time. Of course there are those times you run into a duped SW or hulk and its like FML but those times are rare. Use units on the stronger team to get there faster (I typically refresh my best team until I get to 15)"

ContestOfChampions,3ct174,rangers1024,1 point,Fri Jul 10 18:20:00 2015 UTC,"Since I only have 3* maxed out, I use units to find new matches. If lucky, just 3 or 4 new matches will give you a suitable medium match (usually the next new match is medium but PI is still a bit high). You also may use power boosts (you can stack a green, a orange and a red). After that, just keep using teams with PI higher than 3600 (not counting the boosts!!!! If you use a team with lower PI (but higher than 3600 due to boosts), the 10k+ PI teams are back). One time I had to spend units to find new matches up to match 20... this sucked a lot of units! Try to defeat match 12 with you best team... if you managed to beat them, probably after match 14 or 16 you'll only fight easy teams."

ContestOfChampions,3ct174,RafTGM,1 point,Fri Jul 10 19:31:54 2015 UTC,"I still believe (in this case) the hard streak would be until you beat match 20... I'm playing the Black Bolt arena and had to start it 2 times... one time I spent a few units in new matches and got to match 18 against a 10k team. I wasn't willing to spend more units so I lost. Next time I reached match 14 without spending units. Match 15 was 10k, spent a few units and beat it. All next marches are easy... Here's a pic sorry, it's in Portuguese, I'm Brazilian"
ContestOfChampions,3ct174,RafTGM,1 point,Sat Jul 11 20:52:32 2015 UTC,"I have been getting to about 6 or 7 with my weaker teams, then going two strong, one weak until I get to 12 or so. At that point, you'll get all 5/50 opponents, but they are Thanos or Kang, which means they are far less duped that the MMX teams. At this point I use units to refresh my favorite 3/30 4* team until I hit 20. 15-19 will be easy matches, but they seem to randomly ambush you with a hard one as well. If use my top team I get all easy during this part. If I used a regular 4000 PI team, its about 50/50 if I'll get a hard or easy match.   One of my alliance officers said he used his lowest champs during the hard matches and saved the units. You'll still get hard matches, but winning with a 400 PI champ against a 900 PI opponent isn't too hard if your good at CoC. I haven't tried this method yet, but seems like its worth trying."
ContestOfChampions,3ct174,Thekobra,1 point,Fri Jul 10 19:38:19 2015 UTC,"i went and maxed 9 3* champs and i use them to get past the hardest streaks (12-15).  Power burn champs are the best.  The AI isn't too crazy so you should be able to dodge almost everything, just need to keep them from getting that level 3.  (Also, if you block starlords level 2 combo twice it'll knock out most low hp champs, so you need to keep him extra low)"
ContestOfChampions,3ct174,Ebonlyse,0,Fri Jul 10 21:13:29 2015 UTC,It's insanely hard. That's basically what it comes down to. You need maxed 3 stars and then probably some units :)

ContestOfChampions,3cswkf,SpikeWhiz,4,Fri Jul 10 14:40:57 2015 UTC,"I think the arena change benefits players who don't have a full set of champs. It is a good way to get new champs, but awful to dupe them.  I don't have 4* Hawkeye, so if I went for the 2M milestone in the arena it would be great for me. Then I'd wait on luck draws from crystals to dupe.  Like you, I also have 3* Hawkeye duped level 16, but will not grind for +1 level dupe. I'd have better luck to dupe him from a crystal with much less effort."
ContestOfChampions,3cswkf,Z-Formation,1 point,Fri Jul 10 15:18:44 2015 UTC,"Agreed.  The milestone rewards help us common folk who haven't been able to win these champs yet, and give us a little speck of hope that we can catch up to you guys who already have Hawkeye duped twice."
ContestOfChampions,3cswkf,subredditor41,1 point,Fri Jul 10 16:21:03 2015 UTC,"but awful to dupe them.   To a point.  I'm kinda happy.  Black Bolt is my only maxed out 3* currently (got several others close, but .. doesn't matter), so I'm grinding this arena to dupe him...  I also have Hawkeye already, but he's not duped either.   I'll dupe my Black Bolt and my Hawkeye's signature ability will be awakened at rank 1... not rank 8 like a crystal dupe would get me... but rank 1 is still 1 bazillion times better than rank 0.  Math, making the insignificant significant."
ContestOfChampions,3cswkf,AREYOUSauRuS,2,Sat Jul 11 01:53:36 2015 UTC,"As much as I would prefer they made the milestone dupe like any other dupe, this allows you to awaken your champs, even if it is just +1 to their ability. I wouldn't do it to add +1 to an already duped champ, but to either acquire or awaken them, I'd be lying if I said I wouldn't chase it."

ContestOfChampions,3cswkf,richyboy1980,0,Sat Jul 11 15:59:03 2015 UTC,Whatttttttt usually a 3 star dupe is x8 per iteration. Wtf? Seriously the milestone will count as one dupe? That makes zero sense. One dupe is x8 levels for their sig ability. It should be the same now. I hope so
ContestOfChampions,3cswkf,psykologikal,3,Fri Jul 10 17:24:00 2015 UTC,"As others have pointed out, Kabam did not add the heroes as milestones so people could dupe them. It is 100% for the individuals that put effort into the arenas but don't have the horses to hit the 550k (3) or close to 4m (4) to receive the featured hero. This milestone gives those individuals something to help build their team."

ContestOfChampions,3cpqw1,anthem47,9,Sat Jul 11 06:02:36 2015 UTC,I think people were expecting (or at least hoping) for RELIEF from grinding and instead what we got was just a REWARD for grinding.  I mean who in their right mind would put up 450k to get a 'lesser' Hawkeye and just stop there?  Why not grind 2-3 more times and get in the top scoring?

ContestOfChampions,3cpqw1,Thekobra,4,Thu Jul 9 23:52:38 2015 UTC,"I think this is really insightful, and answers it perfectly. Regardless of what had I hoped for, this milestone is simply a reward for grinders, nothing more."

At least this move will set it in stone."
ContestOfChampions,3cpqw1,Burroughsd,1 point,Fri Jul 10 14:07:22 2015 UTC,"Thats totally true, but the reason they added the milestone is because we complained that the gap between coming close to winning the feature champion rank award and just missing was huge. Even more so in the 4* arena. Could you imagine putting in 20+ hrs over 3 days and spending $50 worth of units only to get a 3* champion?   Now you can safely go all and know that at worst you'll end up with that milestone champ."

If it's too much work, then at least you know after a couple rounds that it's not for you. Anyway, it's genuinely a positive development IMO."
ContestOfChampions,3cpqw1,SomDonkus,3,Thu Jul 9 23:44:29 2015 UTC,That's exactly what I thought the point of them were.  I think it was a good addition.
ContestOfChampions,3cpqw1,VeronicaLowe,3,Fri Jul 10 01:28:48 2015 UTC,"I agree with the original post.  This game does not care about casual gamers.  I just quit my 1M+ plus alliance because I'm burned out and there is no relief in sight. Such high milestones for a second rate champ is pretty lame.  Don't get me wrong, I have loved the game and think Kabam appears to be heading in the right direction...  Maybe I'll come back in 6 months and see if anything is better (and by better, I mean, I could play this game for an hour a day and still work towards achieving something)."
ContestOfChampions,3cpqw1,t0talnonsense,3,Fri Jul 10 00:47:16 2015 UTC,I just wish... they used a percentage based ranking system. But that would make things easier so Kabam wouldn't get any money.
ContestOfChampions,3cpqw1,VeronicaLowe,3,Fri Jul 10 00:56:39 2015 UTC,Too much logic. What are you trying to do make a user friendly game
ContestOfChampions,3cpqw1,t0talnonsense,3,Fri Jul 10 01:13:59 2015 UTC,450k is lower than the cutoff was the last two 3* arenas.
ContestOfChampions,3cpqw1,khafra,6,Thu Jul 9 20:15:42 2015 UTC,450k used to be more than enough to guarantee the arena champ too. Point inflation is a real and serious problem. This doesn't help that.

ContestOfChampions,3cpqw1,SomDonkus,1 point,Fri Jul 10 01:33:04 2015 UTC,"Keep in mind that a lot of the point inflation is due to the new scoring system to, not just players driving the scores up. I mean, that is also happening, but I don't think its as serious as you."
ContestOfChampions,3cpqw1,rangers1024,2,Fri Jul 10 04:58:48 2015 UTC,But a lot higher than either SWitch arena.  So this milestone will push the BB minimum up a lot.
ContestOfChampions,3cpqw1,xenithflare,2,Thu Jul 9 20:41:50 2015 UTC,"I agree. It is also going to push the cutoffs higher.   In their defence, they couldn't set it much lower or it would set the balance off. Champs can't be super easy to get (besides 2*)."
ContestOfChampions,3cpqw1,SomDonkus,2,Thu Jul 9 20:07:22 2015 UTC,I made a similar post. I agree completely. They just had to make it like 350k or an even 300k but at this rate there's no incentive for players who never make it that high to begin with to keep playing. I'm only back for the Antman quests.
ContestOfChampions,3cpqw1,Voltaire325,3,Fri Jul 10 01:12:33 2015 UTC,A player that can't hit 450 really shouldn't be worrying about doing vs for the 3*. That player should be working towards the two crystal milestones and questing.
ContestOfChampions,3cpqw1,Lealdini,2,Fri Jul 10 02:47:38 2015 UTC,"I've regularly hit 300-350k in the newb bracket since Magneto and consistently place within the top 700, winning the featured champ + two PHCs.

ContestOfChampions,3cpqw1,slumpsox,2,Fri Jul 10 06:13:52 2015 UTC,Thanks for making my point for me
ContestOfChampions,3cpqw1,microteck7,4,Fri Jul 10 19:54:15 2015 UTC,I honestly think they hit it perfect.  450k is there to reward grinders who just can't push it over the top.  As previously mentioned it is lower than the last few cut offs.  The arena is not for casual players it is to reward grinders.  I guess they could have added a 2* at the 250k milestone for casual people.
ContestOfChampions,3cpqw1,chrisbroncos76,5,Thu Jul 9 20:32:34 2015 UTC,well.. they kinda do.. 1 PC = 2* guaranteed
ContestOfChampions,3cpqw1,CATTROSKA,2,Fri Jul 10 00:54:56 2015 UTC,A very nice solution in the 3* arena would be to add the 3* version as a reward.  I have always wanted this.

ContestOfChampions,3cpqw1,VickoNL,1 point,Fri Jul 10 01:34:38 2015 UTC,It's fine. It is supposed to be a guarantee if you attempt a legitimate grind for a rank reward that you aren't left with nothing. It isn't meant to be easy.

With the 2 star arena i'm quite good though, i have eight teams maxed out, two other teams waiting to be maxed out. So, for now, my best bet is to max out my 3 star duped SW and team up with my duped 3 star UC to finish Thanos off 100% and get that second 4 star :D"
ContestOfChampions,3cpqw1,t0talnonsense,1 point,Fri Jul 10 04:41:23 2015 UTC,I think it's fine. It's supposed to be a good reward you get no matter what when you go for the champion in competition. It's not a consolation price for when you can't afford to compete seriously for said champion.
ContestOfChampions,3cpqw1,AspirePower,1 point,Fri Jul 10 07:06:47 2015 UTC,People seem to forget that you can save units and use them on your best champions in the arena. Getting to 450k or 2M isn't that hard if you save up your earned units for a while!
ContestOfChampions,3cpqw1,menkent,0,Fri Jul 10 08:01:03 2015 UTC,"I'm not trying to criticize you for being a casual player because I don't play that much either but what do you believe is a fair score to receive the Champs? They could be lower a bit in my opinion maybe 400k and about 1.6-1.7mil would be ideal because if it's any lower it devalue a lot of the champs. I really believe that the scores needed for the champs should be reflected by the bracket the person is in. So 150k for beginner, 300k intermediate, and 400k to get the champ in the veteran. My only hope is they eventually change the bracket system from account age to Summoner overall or something more sensible."
ContestOfChampions,3cpqw1,ductyl,5,Thu Jul 9 20:19:23 2015 UTC,"If you have a roster of 10 teams, still at 3/1, you bring in about 15,000 points per a full rotation.  400,000 / 15,000 = 26.6666 full rotations. That's roughly 8 full rotations a day.  If a rotation is 35 minutes (I would argue it's closer to 40/45, but let's be generous), you need to spend 15.5 hours over a 3 day period playing the game. That equates to 5.12 hours per day.  Now, assume a person sleeps 6 hours a day, and works 8. You allow 1 hour for commute there and back. A person is left with 9 hours in their day. This doesn't account for getting ready in the morning, eating dinner at night, or spending any time with your family/running errands. Still, disregarding all of those things, a person is left with 9 hours of ""free"" time. Kabam would expect a player to spend 50% of their free time playing this game in order to win the weaker, guaranteed, three star champ. That's absurd.  On the other hand, you can earn more points if all of your champions are maxed. I haven't gotten there yet, so I don't know what the point total is per round if everyone is 3/30. Regardless, even if that only knocks of 3 full rotations of 10 teams, you are still stuck playing the game for 13.8 hours, or 4.6 hours per day.   My math was wrong. I didn't multiply by 3 champs per team. So I was running the numbers with 1500points/ team, rather than 1500 points/champ. It comes out to roughly 6/7 hours of play over 3 days."
ContestOfChampions,3cpqw1,t0talnonsense,3,Thu Jul 9 20:44:06 2015 UTC,"You're math is correct, but a few numbers are off. I have 30 2* champs, so 10 full teams. After I get past the first 15 matches I can go on an infinite win streak gaining roughly 4k-5k per team so 40k-50k per full rotation of all my teams. So on the low end of 4k per team that's only 10 rotations of my 10 teams(about 100-115 total wins) over a 72hr time window to get the score needed. Also forgot to mention that all of my 2* champs are 3/1."
ContestOfChampions,3cpqw1,VeronicaLowe,2,Thu Jul 9 20:55:16 2015 UTC,"Ten rotations is still a lot. A full run with all my teams takes me about 50 mins, so the most I can typically manage in a day is two. In a best case scenario, this lets me hit 250k if I squeeze in another half a rotation near the end. That's about 1hr40mins for the first two days and 2hrs for the third day. Then I repeat for the next arena. For a casual gamer, that's a tonne of gameplay they're asking for.   And that's assuming I don't lose my multiplier."
ContestOfChampions,3cpqw1,t0talnonsense,2,Thu Jul 9 21:09:03 2015 UTC,"I agree. If the only way to get new characters (aside from the pitifully low chances in the crystals) is to grind for 2-4 hours per day, it really discourages casual players from taking the step up to semi-serious players. With no sense of advancement there just isn't any incentive to keep playing. Grind grind grind no reward, grind grind grind no reward, repeat."
ContestOfChampions,3cpqw1,VeronicaLowe,2,Thu Jul 9 21:24:35 2015 UTC,"Yup. I basically don't deal with the arenas at all except to help out on my alliance quests, I've got a job and shit, I can't be grinding all day long. I just take my daily crystal and enjoy the story quests."
ContestOfChampions,3cpqw1,AspirePower,1 point,Fri Jul 10 16:43:22 2015 UTC,You're right. I didn't multiply by 3 a second time. [(500 *3 (bonus multiplier)*3 (champs)*10 (teams))= 45000. I did (500*3 (bonus multiplier)*10 teams)=15000]. I'll run the math again and edit my original post.

ContestOfChampions,3crf11,linke92,2,Fri Jul 10 10:56:28 2015 UTC,"Or, you can consider doing only the achievable stuff and not bother with the ones that you cannot do. So you can still enjoy the game."

ContestOfChampions,3cqo95,Calamity27_42,1 point,Fri Jul 10 00:20:32 2015 UTC,"i would focus on gamora,collosus,punisher(i think he is better than hawkeye if u go long streak in the arena that ur L1 gets blocked almost always) and then i would go for UC cuz u dont have a mystic and propably u ll dupe ur UC sometime soon(i havent dupe mine and i play 3 months tho but thats ultra rare possibility)"
ContestOfChampions,3cqo95,manakoube,1 point,Fri Jul 10 01:27:58 2015 UTC,"Are you upgrading for quests or for the arena? If it's for quests, you need to get one of each class like /u/rockstar323 suggests. If it's arena then Punisher over Hawkeye.  Regardless, you need to upgrade Captain Marvel, she's pretty good. I like her over Gamora."
ContestOfChampions,3cqo95,nimrod1138,1 point,Fri Jul 10 02:25:16 2015 UTC,I honestly prefer Hawkeye over Punisher for arenas. That L1 is clutch for keeping your opponent from getting his L3. Even at the higher levels it's not hard to land it once you get your timing down.
ContestOfChampions,3cqo95,rockstar323,1 point,Fri Jul 10 04:00:56 2015 UTC,"I find it so hard to get the timing down for the L1 and L2's for any champ, I find them almost always blocked by the AI once my streak gets into the 30-40's. I find myself waiting for the L3 to kick in."
ContestOfChampions,3cqo95,nimrod1138,1 point,Fri Jul 10 13:30:52 2015 UTC,"For me, I found if I hold block then slide my thumb over the power button while still blocking you can let go and tap it real quick when they dash forward or charge a heavy. Lands almost every time."
ContestOfChampions,3cqo95,rockstar323,0,Fri Jul 10 13:41:33 2015 UTC,"I would go with these five in this order.  Captain Marvel - she has the highest PI of cosmic characters when maxed out   Gamora - considered the best cosmic when duped  Colossus - considered the best mutant   Hawkeye - considered the best skill, L1 is insane  Unstoppable Colossus - most likely will dupe him at some point, one of the best mystics  That would be a hell of a quest team, especially if you max them all out.  I realize there are 2 cosmics in that list but I personally don't think it's necessary to have 5 different classes for my quest team."
ContestOfChampions,3cqo95,rockstar323,2,Fri Jul 10 02:07:54 2015 UTC,thanks for the input. i will definitely give it a go

They have the same exact moves and abilities, but Punisher has his bonus damage to L3 based on lost health. Even if you don't find his signature ability that useful, it's still one more thing he has over WS."
ContestOfChampions,3cq9q9,astrospeedyj,1 point,Thu Jul 9 22:33:24 2015 UTC,true and he has the fastest uppercut in game
ContestOfChampions,3cq9q9,Vucko94,3,Thu Jul 9 22:38:01 2015 UTC,I think Drax would like to have a word with you.
ContestOfChampions,3cq9q9,oproski,1 point,Thu Jul 9 23:32:07 2015 UTC,Also Winter Soldier's ability is pretty shitty aswell. I'd go with Punisher anyday.
ContestOfChampions,3cq9q9,y2j_lionsault,1 point,Thu Jul 9 23:43:31 2015 UTC,"I completely agree, especially because when put against certain characters (Colossus, Ultron, Vision) he literally has no signature ability."

Once he's duped a few times, Winter Soldier's sig's not bad at all. Spam L1 and go ham when bleeds stack."
ContestOfChampions,3cq9q9,500foxes,1 point,Fri Jul 10 00:15:31 2015 UTC,Except for the fact that his L1 not always causes bleeding which is a big letdown for a character whose signature depends entirely  of it and with a good AI you can't always go all-out on the enemy after it gets up or else you'll eat either a combo or a special. Punisher's enhaced L3 is way better.
ContestOfChampions,3cq9q9,y2j_lionsault,1 point,Fri Jul 10 00:40:39 2015 UTC,Punisher hands down. They're about exactly the same until 1) Bonus damage on L3 2) Better awakened ability 3) Uppercut heavy attack
ContestOfChampions,3cq3rm,jmislansky,3,Thu Jul 9 21:38:24 2015 UTC,You've got to get your 2* champs to at least 3/1. That will help you to be able to maintain the streaks because once you get past 15 wins then all the following matches are easy thereby allowing for infinite streaks  You've got a good amount of 2* right now. It's just a matter of their rating
ContestOfChampions,3cq3rm,WeSwaggidup,1 point,Thu Jul 9 21:49:39 2015 UTC,What's the easiest/fastest way to get that?
ContestOfChampions,3cq3rm,WeSwaggidup,2,Thu Jul 9 21:50:11 2015 UTC,You'll just have to go through quests and open crystals to accumulate a lot of ISO. Also level up your guys in groups of 3 so that you have balanced teams. The good thing is that you haven't 100% the acts. That is a great way to get ISO
ContestOfChampions,3cq3rm,dillpatriot,1 point,Thu Jul 9 21:56:14 2015 UTC,I second this notion
ContestOfChampions,3cq3rm,Naibude,1 point,Fri Jul 10 01:18:57 2015 UTC,"Level your guys up.  Go through the daily quests everyday.  Even if you don't need the class cat right now, eventually you will.  as /u/WeSwaggidup stated, level your guys in teams.  This will make it easier for ensuring you win matches.  I know people argue for the sandbag method, but if you do and get unlucky with the class matchups, you're already down 1.  Also, when you're getting to those tough matchups, use a boost to get you over the hump and squeak out a few more points."
ContestOfChampions,3cq3rm,Warrmageddon,1 point,Fri Jul 10 03:08:03 2015 UTC,"I was definitely in your shoes in the beginning as well. My best advice is to finish Act 1 and then keep replaying Act 1 for a little bit to get as much gold and ISO as possible, as well as playing the daily events to get as many catalysts as possible so you can get everybody at 3/1. Once you're at that point, the arena will get easier and you'll probably stumble across a 3* or two that will help you out a ton in Act 2."

I can be active every 2 hours in the arena because I work with cellphones so it's not forbidden to play with them. besides that I guess just getting lucky with PCs and finding an active alliance right away.

It's an old champ, that means the people who can reach it (older players) either don't care since it's only one more level on the special or are already hitting it. 2 million hasn't been the 4* cutoff in forever, and 450k has been relatively average. So my suspicion is they'll be relatively close to what they have been...factoring in the popularity of the character.  Deadpool? They'll be insane."

ContestOfChampions,3cp3u7,SomDonkus,3,Thu Jul 9 17:14:53 2015 UTC,"The cutoff is already usually above 450k so it really wont change much.

ContestOfChampions,3cp3u7,Sylgamesh,1 point,Thu Jul 9 17:20:07 2015 UTC,Yes the cutoff is usually above 450k for new champs.  SW could be had at about 390k.  BB would have been even lower I bet.  Who knows now.

ContestOfChampions,3cp3u7,alSeen,1 point,Thu Jul 9 17:33:21 2015 UTC,But getting 450k can take awhile lol and if you dont want to grind you might not be able get Hawkeye from milestone. Unless you have rank 3 level 30

ContestOfChampions,3cp3u7,arfcom,1 point,Thu Jul 9 19:19:11 2015 UTC,"Or push to 3/30 like me. You get about 5,500 per battle.  Much less playing time in the long run."

ContestOfChampions,3cp0hd,chrisbroncos76,1 point,Fri Jul 10 03:52:57 2015 UTC,"Well, huge damage + stun is very valuable. Stun is comparable to bleed because each one makes the opponent lose more damage right away (stun, you just attack them, then get another L1). You're right about Vision though. Power burn is incredible."
ContestOfChampions,3cotav,jmislansky,2,Thu Jul 9 15:58:58 2015 UTC,"6 teams maybe enough for black bolt.  He's not a very popular character.  You just have to do some math and see if you can swing.  As an example:  If your heroes are 3/1 then you'll earn about 1500 per fight, 4500 per match up.  So every 2 hours you get in 6 Rounds for about 27k.  Aim for 450k and you are looking  at about 18 Rounds.  Divide that by 3, the number of days of the arena, and you would need to play 6 times per day.  This is leaves a little wiggle room for losing fights (not matchups)."

Either of them with Gamora or Black Panther and I can KO him. Bleed damage helps a lot because his constant armor up. Really any champ can do fairly well, just get used to when he uses he specials so you can block. I like to dash back and when he lunges forward I start my combo. If he starts blocking a lot and has a special try to bait it out. Honestly the first few fights I got my ass kicked even with the maxed out champs... It's all about rhythm.

It seems like almost everything is taking forever to load, never have I seen the little spinning pirate ship steering wheel-esque icon in the bottom right corner so often. It's getting really frustrating.   Also, right before I decided to come post this, the game told me I lost connection and pulled up a list of available wifi connections, but.. I was already connected to wifi and everything else that needed internet connection was working fine. So after double checking, I hit ""reconnect"" and it has been loading for over 3 minutes..

Thor - awakened, he is practically unbeatable. Good synergy with Iron Man. My favorite cosmic champ, slightly edging Gamora.  Iron man - duped, he is easily the best questing tech champ.

ContestOfChampions,3clblo,mumurai,13,Wed Jul 8 20:15:11 2015 UTC,"For convenience:  We are trying out adding a hero to the milestone during the upcoming Black Bolt Arenas. Yep...we’re going to try it. This is a big change to the overall game, and one we had to carefully consider.  The heroes awarded in the Milestone Rewards will be a little different than a normal hero.   To start, we’ll be awarding an older hero. Hawkeye will be the first available. This will ensure there is still competition for the ranked rewards. But for those of you who have been grinding away and getting lesser rewards, you will now have a guaranteed shot at a 3* or 4* hero if you achieve the milestone level. The hero will not have the normal bonus if you duplicate them. Duplicating this copy of the hero will not award ISO, and will apply only a +1 bonus to the signature ability. This means if you go for two copies in a week, you can still Awaken this hero. This restriction only applies to copies of the hero you gain from the new Basic Hero milestone prizes. If you duplicate this hero again from crystals or through some other means, it will gain the normal bonus. In all other respects, this hero is exactly the same as a copy obtained through crystals or other means. This change will be represented by a blue-tinted hero portrait in the milestone prize. Ranked reward prizes will stay the same for now. But we know that distribution of ranked prizes is still a reported concern. This change will allow us to maintain the balance of our other systems, but provide a clear and achievable method of earning a 3 and 4-star hero.    After the Black Bolt arenas, we’ll evaluate the effects of this prize and make some decisions on which arenas we will offer it again in the future. It is unlikely we will offer a hero prize in every arena, but we will look at trying it again after we see the effects from this test."

ContestOfChampions,3ckqq5,Girafarigno,1 point,Wed Jul 8 18:41:55 2015 UTC,I think so. They've rewarded Quest rewards retroactively. Plus with them giving out a 4* Crystal they CAN NOT give it to people that have already completed it. The pitchforks would be out in force.

ContestOfChampions,3cnzwb,lvillani81,3,Thu Jul 9 12:52:32 2015 UTC,"Number one is the usual Iron Man we see in the MCU, and the Invincible Iron Man series of comics. FYI, it's about to make a redebut as the centerpiece of the all-new, all-different Marvel Universe (the one after secret wars).  The Superior Iron Man Armor is the one used by Tony Stark after a shift in his moral axis, it's the one used by Stark in the arcs leading up to Secret Wars. It's Endo-Sym armor meaning it's stored in the hollows of his bones. Also, it is mainly powered by his Repulsor Tech.  The Hulkbuster armor is made to, you guessed it, bust the Hulk. However, it never did do the job in the comics (Earth-616). But it did beat the Hulk in the MCU (Earth-199999).  The Iron Patriot armor was used by Norman Osborn in his tenure as Director of SHIELD after Tony Stark stepped down.  And the War Machine is the armor piloted by Stark's best friend Col. Rhodes. While it is designed to pack more conventional firepower, Tony's own armor is superior since it cinstantly gets updates so to speak."
ContestOfChampions,3cnzwb,TheModernMachiavelli,1 point,Thu Jul 9 12:53:14 2015 UTC,I thought Endosym was the armor he created with relevance to the symbiote.  Extremis was the one stored in his bones?  Endosym also absorbs energy and he can access it telepathically?

He's a cool character to have, but not worth ranking if you have other alternatives for quests, etc..."
ContestOfChampions,3clz2g,julesryan,1 point,Thu Jul 9 14:46:05 2015 UTC,He only comes in a 3 or 4 star. I've pulled the 3 star from a Premium Crystal so being as that crystal has low odds of getting a 3* or 4* might be rare to grab.

ContestOfChampions,3clwla,meandizzle,2,Wed Jul 8 22:48:42 2015 UTC,"Looks like this was an oversight with the update. I read a few posts on the official forums mentioning this and one User said that Kabam mentioned it was a mistake on their end and the synergy bonuses will get added back very soon (as in an update is not needed, they fix it server side)."
ContestOfChampions,3clwla,SirMonkeyWaffles,1 point,Wed Jul 8 23:33:12 2015 UTC,Info appreciated man. My blood pressure just dropped a bit. I assumed it was because Ultron is the host/whatever of the new alliance events (as said in update notes). Fingers crossed.
ContestOfChampions,3clwla,SirMonkeyWaffles,2,Wed Jul 8 23:36:20 2015 UTC,Haha. The forums were looking for blood as they thought he was getting nerfed.
ContestOfChampions,3clwla,xenithflare,2,Wed Jul 8 23:48:18 2015 UTC,"Can't say I wouldn't see why. He's a monster. But still. People grinded for him, plus his synergies....some spent units. I'd be pissed too."
ContestOfChampions,3clp7f,SomDonkus,2,Wed Jul 8 21:51:34 2015 UTC,The official release notes on the forum mention a collaborative Alliance quest. I'm going to assume that is where the Battlegroup chat comes into play. No mention of Bases though.
ContestOfChampions,3cmbz4,MnMSolo,2,Thu Jul 9 00:50:57 2015 UTC,With the ULtron Event Quests I believe the new acts were added every week or 2 weeks. You'll have to wait unfortunately.

ContestOfChampions,3cl7bb,oproski,2,Wed Jul 8 19:46:03 2015 UTC,"I can't confirm, but I don't see why they'd lower the price on it, even if they are adding 5* champs.    If they suddenly lowered the price of a 4* crystal, all their whales that spend a fortune on this game would be pissed that they spent that much, and newer players now wouldn't have to.  Personally, I'm guessing that a 5* crystal will just be crazy expensive, like 10,000 units."
ContestOfChampions,3cl7bb,Robbap,2,Wed Jul 8 19:57:00 2015 UTC,well that paid for them when they were top of the line.  You could buy a ps3 on release for $500.  When the ps4 came out the price dropped
ContestOfChampions,3cl7bb,Ebonlyse,1 point,Wed Jul 8 21:38:46 2015 UTC,"I don't see it being cheaper as well, but I do add if being more common. They'll probably raise the chance of obtaining a 4*, exploration reward was one example!"

If the buy a 5* crystal deal (assuming there is one) works the same way as the 4*.....good God we're gonna be hoarding a lot more than ever."
ContestOfChampions,3cl7bb,quietisland,1 point,Wed Jul 8 23:32:59 2015 UTC,I would guess they will award higher unit rewards for quests in Act 4 as opposed to lowering the cost of the crystals.
ContestOfChampions,3cjiem,TDAWG1000,6,Wed Jul 8 11:59:05 2015 UTC,Agreed!  Milestones should be based off of the alliance rank and average member rank.
ContestOfChampions,3cjiem,thedukeoftank,2,Wed Jul 8 13:34:42 2015 UTC,"The duel 3 day event was just as bad, and CLEARLY a cash grab. I'm in a 1mil+ alliance, and even with all of us going as hard as possible without spending money & achieving max possible points per day....we still would have had to fork out $40 each for units to recharge to hit the final milestone."
ContestOfChampions,3cjiem,meandizzle,1 point,Wed Jul 8 15:09:32 2015 UTC,Ouch.. well thanks for letting us know the cost.
ContestOfChampions,3cjiem,subredditor41,1 point,Wed Jul 8 17:58:56 2015 UTC,That one was absolutelY a cash grab
ContestOfChampions,3cjiem,TimIsColdInMaine,2,Wed Jul 8 18:09:44 2015 UTC,They know exactly what they are doing. They want you to burn units to get more fights in. If you don't have units they want you to buy them. I feel that the alliance events were added so there would be peer pressure on you to spend units if you don't have a strong enough roster to generate   points.
ContestOfChampions,3cjiem,rockstar323,1 point,Wed Jul 8 19:33:47 2015 UTC,"totally agree, its virtualy impossible to complete unless every memeber actively pursuses it, my alliance is 900,000 and yet we only completd 80% so far"

ContestOfChampions,3cjiem,grathan,1 point,Wed Jul 8 12:48:10 2015 UTC,500k alliance is 16k average rating. Even with 1.5 million rating it would be difficult unless people play day and night.
ContestOfChampions,3cjiem,TimIsColdInMaine,1 point,Wed Jul 8 14:26:51 2015 UTC,"My alliance is 1.2 million, RHS Honger league.  We are on pace to get it ( 70 percent with just over 1 day left).  This is far from unachievable.  We were under a million when Ultron started and steadily growing.   I went from being in the middle of the alliance rating wise to one of the bottom members (30k rating).   In this event I have played often, but not as much as I would if I was going for the 3 star, I'm just grinding for arena crystals for gold.  I'm currently in position 19 for alliance participation.  This is very doable.  Some events I would agree with you on, but we are far from an elite alliance, just a good, hard working one.  If everyone puts on their time it's doable"
ContestOfChampions,3cjiem,Ebonlyse,1 point,Wed Jul 8 15:21:58 2015 UTC,"some alliance events are easier, some harder.  This one was more difficult, the duels are credit burns, there have been easier ones"
ContestOfChampions,3cjiem,SKxB,0,Thu Jul 9 00:47:14 2015 UTC,Alliance events are for top alliances only lol. If your not in a good alliance don't even bother trying for the events bro. It's how the top stay at the top and distance themselves from the rest of us.
ContestOfChampions,3cjiem,TimIsColdInMaine,3,Wed Jul 8 12:50:37 2015 UTC,"Big difference between a good alliance and top alliance.  Anyone can form and participate in a ""good""alliance.  Not everyone needs to be GOA or MMX for at least half these events.  I don't think it's fair that everyone jumps in and tries to say that.  This event is straight grinding that anyone can do.  I will give you that the rank up events and similar heavily favor those with 4 stars for the huge points, but not this event or perfect streak"
ContestOfChampions,3cjiem,SKxB,1 point,Wed Jul 8 15:48:50 2015 UTC,"Yeah I know man, but 'good' alliances are pretty hard to find lol. I've been in quite a few alliances now and I would say the odds of finding an alliance where all of the members are active and grind for the events are pretty low bro."
ContestOfChampions,3cjiem,TimIsColdInMaine,1 point,Wed Jul 8 21:35:57 2015 UTC,"I totally understand and get that, but I kind or think that's how it should be.  A good alliance should be valued by everyone in it.  Not dominating like MMX, but if everyone works together then maybe they can win"
ContestOfChampions,3cjiem,Afiq3688,0,Wed Jul 8 21:52:43 2015 UTC,"Iso-a did it without the slightest trouble but  duh, they have people winning 4*s left and right.   Iso-b and iso-o had to collaborate and swap members around to make sure one of us got it. Though we are each well over a million neither could have gotten it all alone. The 2star arenas give such crap points, but only those doing 4star arenas need one anyway so it makes sense.   Alphas used to cost 3 days of grind and hundreds of recharge units, they are supposed to be hard to get. I have 6 more than I need now tho, they still seem too easy to get to me.    They are meant to be hard, start a sister alliance and pool talent for specific events and its really not hard, just takes effort thought and collaboration.   ISO O and B each couldn't get it but together got one easy, perhaps you should work smarter instead of harder and instead of bitching about kabaam not making things way too easy? Just a thought."

ContestOfChampions,3ckzd7,Lealdini,1 point,Wed Jul 8 18:55:16 2015 UTC,Ya i wouldn't use units till you are SURE you can compete and get over 3 million
ContestOfChampions,3cj69p,Jeercarb,8,Wed Jul 8 09:19:20 2015 UTC,"I'm one of those people. His ""power steal"" and ""health steal"" is incredible, and you have the ability to use it when you want. Well within the 7 seconds it's available. It usually appears twice per match, and whatever damage you do to your opponent it adds to your health."
ContestOfChampions,3cj69p,C4NN1B41,2,Wed Jul 8 10:40:02 2015 UTC,"The health you gain is equivalent to a percentage only (about 50% I guess), but it is VERY helpful at times."

ContestOfChampions,3cj69p,redditorguy,1 point,Wed Jul 8 18:09:34 2015 UTC,That's the heal. Do damage to your opponent and you'll heal while that icon is up.

ContestOfChampions,3cj69p,redditorguy,4,Wed Jul 8 19:08:05 2015 UTC,"I'm also one of those people. Imagine, every 7 seconds, you get a buff that (one at a time; rotating):   Gives you additional armor and block proficiency (armor icon) Gives you additional damage (like fury) and higher crit chance (fury icon) Gives you the ability to steal health from the opponent. (violet icon)   Done imagining? Now add this. Every time you cast your L2, it has various effects depending on the buff active:   Applies weakness to the opponent while armor buff is active (stackable up to 3 times; 3 stacks = Absolutely no damage, even L3) Applies armor break to the opponent while fury buff is active (stackable up to 3 times; 3 stacks = opponent's armor is paper-thin. Simple heavy attack can do devastating damage) Removes opponent buffs while violet buff is active (removes up to 3 times)   BUT WAIT! THERE'S MORE!  Since buffs apply during L3, you deal greater damage while fury buff is active, and healing yourself while violet buff is active. Either way, after the L3 animation, Your opponent's fate is sealed. He gains NO buffs for 4 seconds.   I hope I explained it clearly. Any further questions will be gladly entertained. Thank you for reading this."
ContestOfChampions,3cj69p,Dracarysssss,1 point,Wed Jul 8 13:30:08 2015 UTC,"That's amazing.  The only champ I want that I'm missing.  I don't understand that last part you wrote though:   BUT WAIT!

Either way, after the L3 animation, Your opponent's fate is sealed. He gains NO buffs for 4 seconds."
ContestOfChampions,3cj69p,arfcom,1 point,Wed Jul 8 14:52:27 2015 UTC,"What I mean here is that: Your buffs apply when you cast L3. When you cast his L3 while fury buff is active, you will deal higher damage compared to when you cast it while armor or violet buff is active. When you cast L3 while violet buff (lifesteal buff) is active, you will also gain HP equal to the percentage of the damage you dealt. Either way, it will trigger the main effect of his L3 which is Fate Seal (prevents from gaining buffs). Have I clarified your confusion? :)"

I dont know if that is one of his abilities but I would love an official explanation of them.  It bums me out that i have his 3* maxed out and he is not in my top 4 anymore.  Weaker PI than my 3* 4-35 Punisher"
ContestOfChampions,3cj69p,bobiel,-2,Wed Jul 8 13:04:06 2015 UTC,"I think doc strange is not so powerful. When I fight against him in versus, he is very weak and cannot take much damage. You just have to care to block his L1 and L2 and its ok.   There are more stronger opponents that I avoid : Wolvy and Iran Man (for their regeneration), and perhaps Jug and Unstoppable (for their unstoppable)."
ContestOfChampions,3cj69p,EdChute_,2,Wed Jul 8 10:37:14 2015 UTC,by 'power' I think they mean when using him. Bots are weak yaknow..
ContestOfChampions,3cj69p,C4NN1B41,1 point,Wed Jul 8 10:41:29 2015 UTC,He's only easy because you are fighting a bot.
ContestOfChampions,3cj69p,DhamonGrimwulf,1 point,Wed Jul 8 10:42:22 2015 UTC,"Right. The AI is exactly the same for every champ, and Dr. Strange should be played with different strategies in mind. You have to know when to use his specials, understand his 7-second rotation, etc. When you know this, you can control the fight. The AI, however, just uses him as it would any other champion, thus making it much easier to fight against.  edit: actually, I suspect the AI triggers some champ abilities more often than others (e.g. (The)Vision AI spams his L1 almost guaranteed), but I believe that's the extent of it. The overall mechanics are the same."

ContestOfChampions,3ck6no,subredditor41,2,Wed Jul 8 15:51:03 2015 UTC,i like fighting tougher AI better than fighting higher rank opponents.  I haven't had nearly as many 1 hit L3 kills as I did before.  You dont have to be perfect now and you can still win.  Often I win and take more hits than I receive.  I have stopped tagging my L1/L2 onto the end of a combo and now only use them if the AI is charging me
ContestOfChampions,3ck6no,mdkosu,-1,Wed Jul 8 17:15:46 2015 UTC,An actual cheat has been discovered in arena. While fighting star-lord I saw his health rising when blocking my combos. Submitted a ticket and they said it's a wide spread problem being addressed. Thought I'd share that.

I don't know where he makes his money considering to be a top player like him he probably has to devote all his time to the game.

ContestOfChampions,3cim7d,Alsciende,1 point,Wed Jul 8 05:02:49 2015 UTC,"Yeah this guy has spent thousands. I was watching a video of him doing realm of legends and he just bought a team revive every time his team died, which is $5 per. Each champ has like 500k+ health, and in a good run he might take off like 15k health (He didn't use health potions because he figured that wasn't as cost effective), so doing a little math that comes to just under $200 per kill, multiply that by like 10 or however many champs there are in that. He didn't beat it that I know of though. Got to scarlet witch and realized he didn't want to invest that much in beating Wolverine, which he said he talked to other people who had beaten it and said it can cost $600-$800 just to beat Wolverine. This guy claimed he had probably spent 4 or 5 grand on the game but I'm guessing it's actually much more..."
ContestOfChampions,3cim7d,subredditor41,2,Wed Jul 8 05:42:33 2015 UTC,"I might know who you are talking about, Jonesy?  I liked that guys videos, was rooting for him to win all the glory.  Anyway, just for fun this is me purely speculating on some numbers. I'm no mathematician and probably don't know the game as well as most, but maybe I'm not far off.   Let's say I'm a new player with unlimited funds and just want to buy a team of (21) 4s to take a crack at the 4 arena. I buy (100) PHCs and estimate I will get roughly (84) 2s, (15) 3s, and (1) 4. For simplicity let's assume the (84) 2s get me (8) 3* crystal offers, which I buy. I've now gotten (23) 3s total, and we'll assume that gets me (2) 4 crystal offers, which I buy.  (100) PHCs = 10,000 units (8) 3* crystals = 3200 units (2) 4* crystals = 5000 units  At $100 for 3100 units it'd cost you about $600 to make the above play for (3) 4s. Do that 7 times total ($4200) to get (21) 4 champs. And realistically you'll need to do this more than 7 times because some of the 4*s you receive will be dupes and not add a team member.   I really hope I am wrong on that projection, I can't believe somebody would drop that much money on a mobile app. If somebody knows more than me and can provide some insight I would appreciate it. For some reason, thinking about how much the top players have dropped on this game fascinates me in a weird way"
ContestOfChampions,3cim7d,subredditor41,2,Wed Jul 8 06:26:03 2015 UTC,"Yep, it was Jonesy. Yeah I was interested to know how much money he has dropped on the game, but I figured it was probably much higher than what he claimed because he probably just didn't want to admit to the actual amount he had spent...maybe he legitimately doesn't know because he doesn't seem to even put any second thought in as he purchases $5 team revives...  And yeah 4 grand is probably a pretty conservative estimate for his stash of 4*, but on top of that he had to have spent over a grand on that Realm of Legends run alone"
ContestOfChampions,3cim7d,sargeantb2,0,Wed Jul 8 13:31:57 2015 UTC,Don't we have (1) 4* crystal offer for every (5th) 3* champions we get in a crystal? Your (23) 3* champions should get you (4) 4* crystal offers.

ContestOfChampions,3ch4r6,esteban42,6,Tue Jul 7 21:35:06 2015 UTC,A quick Google search showed me that this crystal gives a guaranteed three star with a chance at a four star.
ContestOfChampions,3cgd3e,adyslexic,2,Tue Jul 7 18:22:47 2015 UTC,"3* is after you get 10 2, 4 is after you get 10 3*"
ContestOfChampions,3cgd3e,Quiwundi,1 point,Tue Jul 7 18:31:04 2015 UTC,You mean 10 2s in a row? Or 10 2s total?
ContestOfChampions,3cgd3e,smellis45,1 point,Tue Jul 7 18:54:40 2015 UTC,"After you get 10 2* from crystals I think, doesn't matter if they are in a row"
ContestOfChampions,3cgd3e,Quiwundi,1 point,Tue Jul 7 19:05:23 2015 UTC,But do you mean 10 2 stars during one period of opening crystals in close proximity? Or just 10 total since the time that you began playing the game?
ContestOfChampions,3cgd3e,smellis45,1 point,Tue Jul 7 19:11:56 2015 UTC,"Total, doesn't matter what time period from what I've experienced"
ContestOfChampions,3cgd3e,Quiwundi,1 point,Tue Jul 7 20:33:45 2015 UTC,"But then wouldn't the 3 star crystal always be available after you have accumulated 10 2*s? Thats not the case for me at least. It only pops up as an offer form time to time when I have been opening crystals recently. I dont mean to be difficult here, I am actually really interested in how the hell this works because I am saving up units lol"
ContestOfChampions,3cgd3e,smellis45,1 point,Tue Jul 7 20:35:54 2015 UTC,"Haha its ok, from my experience, after you open 10 2 stars from the premium crystals or otherwise, the offer pops and you have the option to buy it for an hour. Then it's gone and you have to open 10 2* before it is available again."

ContestOfChampions,3cgd3e,VeronicaLowe,1 point,Tue Jul 7 19:42:42 2015 UTC,"that means you had gotten 6 2* before that, after your previous 3* offer, and 5 3* previously. (because I can subtract)  btw did you do it?"
ContestOfChampions,3cgzl6,TheUrfRider,4,Tue Jul 7 20:57:54 2015 UTC,"Electro. All the way. Yeah, he's the biggest glass cannon in the game, but with the high crit rate, high chance of stun on specials, and crazy damage on specials, dang.   One caveat: I've heard spidey gets really good at high levels, especially if you can pull a dupe, and he is better balanced."
ContestOfChampions,3cgzl6,esteban42,1 point,Tue Jul 7 21:19:41 2015 UTC,He is. He's incredible with his Evade.

ContestOfChampions,3cgzl6,cmgirardi,3,Tue Jul 7 21:04:08 2015 UTC,"I have a Spidey and an Electro that are both around the same PI. I prefer the Electro. His L2 special is SICK. So is Spidey's, of course, but Electro's also carries a chance to stun. Plus, even unduped, opponents lose health every time they successfully hit you. Spidey's armor break is nice, but I have had my Electro take down far stronger opponents than my Spidey has."
ContestOfChampions,3cgzl6,AMilitantPeanut,1 point,Tue Jul 7 22:46:41 2015 UTC,"I have both as a 3 stars duped and as 4 stars. I enjoy playing with them both.

Even when unduped Electro also has two things on spidey - better criticals, and damage done to the enemy when they hit you.  If you look at the MMX top alliances, you'll see a ton of electros there, but almost never see spiderman. It proves itself. I've dueled Genacide's Dr. Strange (top champion in the game period at one point) and won with electro."

ContestOfChampions,3cgc12,arfcom,1 point,Wed Jul 8 14:22:17 2015 UTC,"Notice when you rank up a 2* that none of their obvious stats change, yet their PI does.  This is because the level that things they do like Bleed go up and in turn increase PI."

And you're not locked out due to your opponent using an L1, L2, or L3. This exact thing happened to me all to often. The opponent is running, not using a super, or even just standing there. I say happened because I've now quit the game, but that glitch affects one of the few elements of skill this game can claim—hitting one of two buttons/hotspots at the right time, and yet your champ just stands there. I'd suggest submitting a ticket to support, but…"
ContestOfChampions,3cevms,User_Not_Found_000,2,Tue Jul 7 11:27:53 2015 UTC,"I had this last night. I had L2 activated and pressed it multiple times with no response. It then built to L3 and I tried pressing it several time, with different fingers and thumbs. Even when the AI and myself were just stood there, no attacking. And nothing happened. I then noticed my block was activating 100% of the time.  Assumed the left side of my phone wasn't recognising the pressure so quit and restarted app. This seemed to work but was still very annoying to happen"

ContestOfChampions,3cevms,Ebonlyse,-6,Wed Jul 8 06:24:20 2015 UTC,You can't use it if the enemy is doing a Power himself
ContestOfChampions,3cevms,DhamonGrimwulf,-1,Tue Jul 7 11:11:53 2015 UTC,"I know that. I mean, I start a combo and when I know it'll finish them I hit it... but nothing."
ContestOfChampions,3cevms,DhamonGrimwulf,-3,Tue Jul 7 11:13:30 2015 UTC,"You should press the special mid-combo. If you just completed a set, there will be a slight delay, where the enemy can attack back, especially if it's the more aggressive AI.  Anyways, what you described (them 'shrugging off' instead of doing the special) only happens to me when the enemy has started a special, and pressing the button basically reverts into defence mode (since you're still pressing the left area of the screen). - edit: hence the 'shrug off effect', you're basically entering (press) and exiting (unpress) defence mode.  If you're 100% sure the enemy is not activating they're attack then it's only 2 possible choices: - The problem is yours, you're missing the bloody button - The problem is a combination of your phone and kabastards' game, where the button's hitbox may be smaller than intended, the hotbox may actually be skewed from the button, or the phone isn't very accurate due to either a crappy hardware screen or a software problem.  99% of the times, problem is between the chair and the device: make sure you're hitting it right, your muscle memory may be making you hit the wrong area."
ContestOfChampions,3cevms,DhamonGrimwulf,-1,Tue Jul 7 11:22:53 2015 UTC,It is mid combo. And I think that the fights are predestined which is why it wont let me do it.  I have noticed that it wont let me do it if the AI is planning on doing and L3 after the combo he has just missed me with because I dodged to the other side of the screen.
ContestOfChampions,3cevms,DhamonGrimwulf,1 point,Tue Jul 7 11:28:23 2015 UTC,"bulocks. Fights are not predestined. The group selected to fight you may be fixed, but the fights can all be won if you have your heroes levelled up enough. Once I learned to fight the AI, I'm yet to lose a winning streak.  The problem is either yourself (you're slow or using a slow champ), or the hardware (may be sluggish - what device are you using anyways?). You just answered me anyways. You said you 'miss' when the opponent is getting ready to do an L3 - that tells me you're just doing something wrong, and the enemy had time to activate his attack. Also, some combos are interruptible if you're not fast at connecting, say, a quick attack (tap) to a medium (swipe).   Anyways, again, what's your device?"
ContestOfChampions,3cevms,VeronicaLowe,-1,Tue Jul 7 11:44:53 2015 UTC,"I run it on a iphone 6 and a surface. I didn't say I missed, learn to read. The AI misses his 5 hit combo because I dodged to the other side of the screen. The AI is shadow boxing, I hit L3 and nothing. At the end of the combo AI L3."
ContestOfChampions,3cevms,DhamonGrimwulf,-5,Tue Jul 7 11:55:52 2015 UTC,"So you were slow. You're not hitting the special soon enough. I never have any problems hitting my specials, play on an iPhone.   The problem is you are likely used to the less aggressive AIs, were you can have some time between hits. The more aggressive AI, you can't be so slow hitting the screen."

ContestOfChampions,3chjmr,TokyoLogger,1 point,Tue Jul 7 23:25:43 2015 UTC,"The 4 star arena doesn't have an infinite streak (that is free).  Unless you have maxed and duped 3 stars and 4 stars at rank 3, your best bet is just losing the streak and using your lower leveled 3 stars to build up the multiplier.  If you have money to burn then just use the ""recharge best team"" method.  Also, since you're in the veteran's bracket now, I wouldn't consider playing in the arena for the champs, but instead for the milestones. You can't compete without spending money."
ContestOfChampions,3chjmr,VSVPROCKY95,1 point,Wed Jul 8 03:00:11 2015 UTC,"Yes it is. I think the cutoff is around 20 matches and the difficulty drops significantly so that every team is labeled ""easy"" to your team with over 1000 PI guys, same as 3* arena. The problem is those hard matches are really crazy fucking hard. Multiple duped maxed 4* wolverines and unstoppable colossus. I used all 3 boosts plus units to recharge my best team (3 non duped 4*s) and even then it took me more than one try to get thru it."

ContestOfChampions,3chjmr,manakoube,1 point,Wed Jul 8 10:11:24 2015 UTC,I think it's level 4/1 you need to be at with all 3 star champs. 4s I think 2/1 But I'm not sure on that one yet.
ContestOfChampions,3chjmr,BAzzyBaby,1 point,Wed Jul 8 14:24:43 2015 UTC,Yes it does. A few tricks I've picked up is from matches 12-15 I use my weakest 3* champs. You'll fight about twice your PI at most and they are pretty win-able if you fight smart. Just like in the 3 star arena you get the dropoff at 15 wins and the AI increase at 20. There is also a level cutoff for your fighters before u are forced to fight maxed champs from what I can tell. 4/1 for 3* and 2/1 for 4* if I had to guess. I don't know the rank for the 3* arena but my Pi has to be above 250 or I have the same problem there.
ContestOfChampions,3chjmr,BAzzyBaby,1 point,Wed Jul 8 14:28:05 2015 UTC,"No! as soon as I get the x3 multiplier I face 4/40 dupes, no matter what I play."
ContestOfChampions,3chjmr,Ghostman_Loon,1 point,Wed Jul 8 15:38:51 2015 UTC,That should only happen if your team is maxed 3's or 4 stars. They are usually about 1.5 times ur PI if I had to guess

ContestOfChampions,3chhpb,VeronicaLowe,2,Wed Jul 8 02:14:09 2015 UTC,Dont have to hit continue. Just the claim button when it shows.  Works for daily too which you coulda been doing for dupe day.

ContestOfChampions,3chgdk,TheUrfRider,3,Wed Jul 8 15:43:17 2015 UTC,I'd say Colossus is the most useful in Arena as he will NEVER lose to Gamora/Black panther.

ContestOfChampions,3cgt5s,oojellah,4,Tue Jul 7 20:13:26 2015 UTC,"I can't confirm but everyone on here states UC has the highest PI potential of anyone in the game.  Couple that with his fury and armor, and there's your answer.  I honestly can't think of one advantage with juggernaut, besides the fact you have a tiny bit of Iso invested in him"
ContestOfChampions,3cgt5s,TimIsColdInMaine,2,Tue Jul 7 20:55:08 2015 UTC,"Someone posted a chart a while back (maybe a month before masteries came out) with every 3* champ's PI unduped as well as the PI values after they've been duped N times, up to 8. Not all the cells are filled, but I believe all have a value for at least once duped. I believe strength and hp values were recorded as well.  From memory, I can confirm that UC has the highest PI of all 3* champs, but as others have stated, he requires around 60% more ISO than other champs. In my opinion, he's worth it.  The trade off for UC and Juggernaut is that Jugg has passive damage reduction. UC has an armor proc but loses his passive armor from regular Colossus. This can be observed with the L3 damage from both while not having the armor proc active; 4/40 Colossus's L3 does more damage than 4/40 UC."

ContestOfChampions,3cgt5s,psykologikal,2,Tue Jul 7 21:25:15 2015 UTC,"Just keep in mind UC takes an incredible amount of ISO.  And then some.  But you will want him leveled up as you have him duped and he has bleed immunity, which juggernaut does not"
ContestOfChampions,3cgt5s,dagibcollecta,2,Tue Jul 7 23:53:54 2015 UTC,"Great comments everyone. Here's one more thing...since you are focused on questing, a duped UC is one of the very best to take down Thanos.  I can virtually beat Thanos ONLY using my once duped UC and no revives. He's been able to take about 65% - 80% of Thanos' power down all by himself. At this point with just 3 Acts, that would be your ultimate objective when questing. GOOD LUCK!"

ContestOfChampions,3cg8jt,castcynic,1 point,Tue Jul 7 18:05:31 2015 UTC,Man it is so tempting! Did you personally unlock Cruelty as well? I'm wondering if it'll finally push my win streaks to a respectable amount since I have some crit friendly champions. I love quick matches because it's easier on the thumbs and wrist ha.
ContestOfChampions,3cg8jt,castcynic,2,Tue Jul 7 18:13:48 2015 UTC,"Yea, I have it maxed out.  Be aware, once you unlock it each level requires units as well.  10, 15, 20, 25, 30.  So it's 100 more units than advertised.  That being said, it's pretty freaking sweet.  Iron Fist, Storm and Black Panther as a team with Cruelty maxed out is wrecking crew.  I can knock em out before they even get to L3 usually."
ContestOfChampions,3cg8jt,castcynic,1 point,Tue Jul 7 18:48:18 2015 UTC,"Yeesh so many units. Unlocked it to 2/5, but you convinced me thanks man. Sounds like total domination with those three. What about Precision, have you bothered with that one at all?"
ContestOfChampions,3cg8jt,Kriya3000,1 point,Tue Jul 7 19:08:49 2015 UTC,"i think that's what I'm going to go for next.  I have ten points in defense, 1 - 9 - nothing.  That's pretty usual.  Then Courage is maxed and 1 - 4 for Fury.  I will have 5 more points when it get to lvl 50.  Prolly gunna do a 1 - 4 in Precision then."
ContestOfChampions,3cg8jt,castcynic,1 point,Tue Jul 7 20:15:25 2015 UTC,"Really been trying hard to find out which is best - Precision or Cruelty.  I only have 8 points.  1 in lesser Precision and 1 in Lesser Cruelty only leaves 6 left to spread over 10 slots in Precision and Cruelty.  What you guys recommend? More crit hits or more damage when I get crit?  I have Gamora, Iron Fist, Black Panther, Iron man and Starlord in current set up."
ContestOfChampions,3cg8jt,Kriya3000,1 point,Wed Jul 8 19:25:31 2015 UTC,and resetting gets very expensive lol.  I would think that 50% from cruelty beats out an extra crit or 2 from precision in a match though.  That's why i put the 5 into it.
ContestOfChampions,3cg8jt,castcynic,1 point,Wed Jul 8 19:36:50 2015 UTC,"Thanks for input! Originally thought Cruelty would be best but people were saying need higher crit rate through Precision.  Ask a silly question, but how do you do a crit hit (can you do it through light or medium or heavy attacks or just specials)?  Also, how often do you get one in a normal fight?  If you almost never get one, do you need Precision to up chances?  I always use Gamora's heavy roundhouse attack and special 1 and was thinking Cru may be good there.  Also wondering how Iron fist would do - one punch done!  Really appreciate your input as have been trawling internet to try to get more info on Precision or Cruelty before using those 8 points!!!!"
ContestOfChampions,3cg8jt,Kriya3000,1 point,Wed Jul 8 21:25:19 2015 UTC,"Iron Fist is a beast with Cruelty.  And yea, it's a lot better with more crits, but not as important to require Precision beforehand.  Typically I get a few each fight.  The biggest thing I notice after adding Cruelty is the duration of fights is noticeably less.  I'm okay with doing less crits if the reason for that is a shorter fight in my favor lol.  An no problem man.  You seem pretty into it.  If you need an alliance, let me know.  I have an opening in mine right now."
ContestOfChampions,3cg8jt,TimIsColdInMaine,1 point,Wed Jul 8 23:25:02 2015 UTC,"Cheers. Defo gunna get Cruelty maxed.  Have realised from reading other posts that the colour of the damage number signifies if normal, crit or fury damage.  I think yellow is the crit hit and the come quite often with my characters so going straight in for Cruelty over Precision!  Boom!  May even strip out my defence and mostly go offense... Lot of effort down for Salve but can always put back on.  Cheers for offer of Alliance but sorted at moment.  Thanks for coming back with answer."

That critical damage is beastly!  At one point I caught an uppercut with my 3 star dr. Strange (4/40), that landed critical on his fury buff and did 1250 damage!  Never came close to that on anything short of an L2."
ContestOfChampions,3cg8jt,VeronicaLowe,1 point,Wed Jul 8 02:53:10 2015 UTC,That's insane! Definitely going for Precision now that the other is maxed out. Just need to keep saving those units for all those stony cores.

ContestOfChampions,3cfzvl,knightzeemo,3,Tue Jul 7 16:52:41 2015 UTC,"Basically just keep practicing until you find a play style that you're good with. Some people block a lot and wait for a gap to open up. Some people dash back and forth the whole match landing hits when they can. Some champions can corner camp with hard strikes until the enemy champ is dead. Just gotta learn lol That was a tough matchup though. Try and avoid fights against Juggs and UC, especially if they're stronger than your champions and you don't have good counters."
ContestOfChampions,3cfzvl,Sylgamesh,1 point,Tue Jul 7 17:01:17 2015 UTC,I think i can fight mediums bot but i cant fight duped that are better in rank and level than me especially because i cant block their L3 that one shotted me .

ContestOfChampions,3cfq8n,Sylgamesh,1 point,Tue Jul 7 16:49:53 2015 UTC,"Do you plan to unlock any masteries that require stoney core? those will set you back 135 units a piece and you'll quite a few depending on how far into the trees you go. then on top of that you'll need units to rank up those masteries once you've unlocked them.  It's my understanding, once unlocked they stay unlocked even if you reset your points but you will lose units spent to rank them up. i have not reset my points yet myself but, as I said, that's my understanding of how they work."

ContestOfChampions,3cf3gw,Obliwan,1 point,Tue Jul 7 12:48:43 2015 UTC,"I thought the same thing, but a maxed out 2* will net at least 1800 per fight.  1800 x 3 = 5400 per match.  After 100 matches, you have 540k.    Using 3-1 and under gets you about 1500 per fight which equals roughly 450k after 100 matches."

Most of those are taken into account when calculating PI. That is why not all heroes will have the exact same PI on the same levels.  Apart from that, if you get a second copy of a champ it'll unlock him or her signature ability, making the champ stronger and the PI will go up from that. Heroes can even have signitures at different levels depending on how often you found that champ.  Lastly, PI is a decent estimate of how strong a hero is, but some heroes have abilities that don't weigh into the PI much, but are very strong when used correctly. For example Dr. Stranges ability to cycle through powers is considered very strong, but his basic PI is pretty low."

After, or at I'm not sure, streak 10 you fight against Kang/Thanos teams. They're fairly easy to beat (Usually medium difficulty for me) and they're usually at 3/30 but easy to beat. If you make it past them to streak 15, you get to fight easy (but God-mode AI) match ups, and you can keep an infinite streak alive.  An important thing if you are having trouble is knowing how to bait out specials, when they've got one and are blocking, dash in then straight back out, sometimes it triggers the special."

So my advice would always be to save for the 4* (or use the units to obtain a 4* from arena, which is probably infeasible for now). 3s are simply to easily obtained from other sources. The only exception to this is if you don't have any 3s yet, then getting one for missions is good, but since you already have 9 and a 4, just save up for the 4 crystal."

As I said you will find many more 3s before you have enough units for the 4 crystal.  It doesn't pop up just once, but every 10 or so times you find a 3* from a crystal. Personally I'd just save up for the 2500 units and then just wait for the 4* offer to pop up. No real need to keep track of how many 3*s you've had since the last time."

I make the teams according to synergy and make their PI s the same, start with your weakest teams and go to strongest and when you finish for 1.30 hours, play wiith your teams with which you can beat rank3/30 s until you get past 15 win streak. After that the point is just fighting good. I always improve from arena to arena but if i have enough time i think ill be able to win a champ for the first time.

ContestOfChampions,3cawfh,esteban42,2,Mon Jul 6 14:19:03 2015 UTC,"lately, it seems like they've been following a pattern of doing a new hero, then an old one, and for the old ones, they seem to be going through the wheel (it was a Science hero, then a Mystic hero last time). So you're probably right that the hero this Thursday will be an old cosmic hero (and I really Really want it to be Black Bolt)."

ContestOfChampions,3caj1a,GiftOfTheGame,0,Mon Jul 6 12:15:26 2015 UTC,"As far as score needed to win an arena character, that's not the devs fault. Is the population of players and the scores they're continually pouring in. The only thing that's change that would be either more brackets to divide the players or a boycott. That last one is never as effective as people think it will be."
ContestOfChampions,3caj1a,Harold76,0,Mon Jul 6 12:22:14 2015 UTC,"The devs refuse to adjust though. There are players in brackets that don't make sense, making it impossible to win champs (even if you pay for units)."
ContestOfChampions,3caj1a,esteban42,1 point,Mon Jul 6 12:40:04 2015 UTC,How do you mean?
ContestOfChampions,3caj1a,GiftOfTheGame,2,Mon Jul 6 14:57:26 2015 UTC,"what /u/GiftOfTheGame may be referring to is people like me. I started playing basically at launch, but I broke my phone and couldn't play for about 6 months. So I'm in Veteran bracket, but I've only got a total PI of about 11k"
ContestOfChampions,3caj1a,subredditor41,3,Mon Jul 6 15:06:23 2015 UTC,"Exactly. It's really not fair to you with this bracket logic.  Another example I recently saw was 2 players with the same PI and # of champs. Both pushed to get 1mm in the 4* arena (assume this is as much as they could push, physically).  The player in the vet bracket isn't close to winning, but the player in the lower bracket can place top 100.  Same players/skills, one is left helpless, competing with mmxiv type of players."
ContestOfChampions,3caj1a,GiftOfTheGame,2,Mon Jul 6 15:16:19 2015 UTC,They are never going to encourage a lower P.I. (which I think this might do).  People would not buy as many crystals. They want everyone to want the highest rating and maxed champs.
ContestOfChampions,3caj1a,esteban42,1 point,Mon Jul 6 16:36:23 2015 UTC,Yeah but I've also noticed that I have been spending less on the game because I realize that no amount of money can help me win the champ.  I would probably spend more if I knew it could help me win the champ. Maybe I'm in the minority here though. I don't mind spending $ on the game and I still feel hopeless for new champs.
ContestOfChampions,3caj1a,VeronicaLowe,1 point,Mon Jul 6 17:14:07 2015 UTC,"The easy fix is to do brackets divided by %, that is, top x% in the top bracket, next x% in the next bracket, etc. It's much harder to manipulate your bracket that way, since there wouldn't be a definite cutoff.  And besides, people will still want new or better heroes for quests."
ContestOfChampions,3caj1a,GiftOfTheGame,2,Tue Jul 7 00:11:45 2015 UTC,start over.  you'll be further ahead.
ContestOfChampions,3caj1a,subredditor41,2,Mon Jul 6 18:59:43 2015 UTC,I've been considering this. Or selling all of my 2* champs even.   Having these as valid options show that there's something wrong with the current state of the game.

ContestOfChampions,3cbmko,Voltaire325,2,Mon Jul 6 18:09:28 2015 UTC,"Iron Patriot it quite a bit better than either Iron Man or Superior Iron Man, imo. His 2 and 3 Specials both stun and do a large amount of damage."
ContestOfChampions,3cbmko,Moshne,2,Mon Jul 6 18:29:57 2015 UTC,"No Iron Patriot here, but I was able to win a 4* WWII Cap in the arena. I had saved up the ISO and cats to take him to 3/30 right away too.   He is now my highest PI non-duped champ and he came close to catching my dupe 3/30 Black Panther. He's a monster and I'm stoked I went for him in the arena.   More than 10k health (like 200 less than 3/30 Juggernaut) and 774 attach. His blocking I believe is the same or slightly less than regular Cap. L2 is 100% to cause bleed (I love 100%) and causes 210% (or 1625) damage over 4 seconds. I haven't had a chance to play him against any 5/50s in the arena yet, but he walked through the hard path of the hard mutant daily. Love him."

Colossus can hold his own against any champion, especially with bleed immunity.  Deadpool was one of my favorites in the beginning, but I still enjoy playing with him.  His l2/l3 don't do much damage, but the bleed damage is outstanding.  I have him duped so he regenerates the entire match as well.  So as long as I slow it down, he can hang with anyone."

ContestOfChampions,3cay82,lvillani81,2,Mon Jul 6 19:33:09 2015 UTC,"From Wikipedia:    Winter Soldier - Powers and abilities: Having trained under Steve Rogers (the original Captain America in World War II) and others in the time leading up to World War II, ""Bucky"" Barnes is a master of hand-to-hand combat and martial arts, as well as being skilled in the use of military weapons such as firearms and grenades. He also used throwing knives on occasion and was a gifted advance scout. His time as the covert Soviet agent known as the Winter Soldier helped to further hone his skills, making him the equal to his predecessor in combat skills and an expert assassin and spy. He is also fluent in many languages, including English, Spanish, Portuguese, German, Russian, Latin, and Japanese.[volume & issue needed] He can understand French.    Winter Soldier's left arm is a cybernetic prosthetic with superhuman strength and enhanced reaction time. The arm can function when not in contact with Barnes and can discharge bolts of electrical energy from its palm. The arm can discharge an EMP causing electronics to either shutdown or become useless. The use of Barnes' EMP is shown when Barnes uses it to shutdown a Nick Fury LMD and when he attempts to use it on Iron Man. The arm has a holographic function to disguise it as a flesh and blood arm.    As Captain America, he possesses the original, indestructible, vibranium alloy shield used by his predecessor, as well as a Kevlar/Nomex blend, shock-absorbing costume. He often carries several conventional weapons such as knives, guns - mostly a Colt 1911-A1 .45 and a P08 Luger and grenades."
ContestOfChampions,3cay82,thedukeoftank,1 point,Mon Jul 6 14:41:43 2015 UTC,Makes sense. Guess lots of characters cross over more than one class.
ContestOfChampions,3cay82,tatianasetsuko,2,Mon Jul 6 17:08:37 2015 UTC,"There are lots of characters that can go in more than one class. I mean as a long time comics reader it really really bugs me that Magik and Scarlet Witch aren't in the mutant class when they are both mutants. Like the first time I couldn't go through a mutant gate on a quest and I had Wanda in my team I'm like but Wanda is a mutant???wtf does not compute! ahem  Black Widow could well be Science since she was empowered by the Soviet equivalent of the super soldier serum and I honestly think Cap would fit better in the skill class, since the serum was just there for his origin-he has relied much more on his skills and training since then.  And yeah I also agree that Iron Fist should be skill not mystic. But it is all about the origin it seems. But then again if it's going strictly by origin not subsequent career then Black Widow should be science not skill. It is not consistent at all. (If Cap is science she should be too, they have basically the same origin!)  It would make more sense if characters could have more than one class. Having Wanda and Illyana not in the Mutant class is just so weird when you are used to the comics and the mutant thing being such a big part of those characters!"

For example a 3 Star Captain America is more powerful than a 2 Star Captain America simply because it can level higher. If you look at the character stats you'll be able to see how much damage they do and what abilities they have. Ideally just keep all your heroes as you'll need them at some point even if not immediately.

ContestOfChampions,3c7zae,oproski,2,Sun Jul 5 19:21:47 2015 UTC,"You have to take the recent inflation in scoring into account.  Under the old setup your score would have been about 345k.  That wouldn't even get you an old champ in the arena.  Considering that this was a holiday weekend and Cap was a new...ish champ, I'd say the cutoffs were pretty low.    Side note, if you haven't maxed out your 2's for the arena, skip the next one and ISO farm.  It will save you hours the next time you decide to compete for a champ.  You should average at least 100-110k for every 20 matches.  If you're not doing that, you're working way harder than you need to."
ContestOfChampions,3c7zae,HumanFusion,1 point,Sun Jul 5 20:10:55 2015 UTC,"It's actually the opposite, under the old setup I would have gotten 440k (before the change 88 streak got me 408k, this time I had a 95 streak). I've had issues with gold ever since the 7 day rank up event, so I haven't been able to max my 2*s (I have 657 items in my stash). Went all out this time on both arenas to help with that, but still only got ~150k gold. I have 4*s I want to rank though, so it will be a while before I get to my 2*s."
ContestOfChampions,3c7zae,HumanFusion,2,Sun Jul 5 20:21:50 2015 UTC,"All I'm saying is a 95 win streak with maxed 2's would net you well over 500k, which would have safely gotten you Cap.  If you're going to take the time to play 95 matches over two days, you might as well get the same reward that the other people putting in that work are getting.  Once the scoring changed I stopped ranking up my 3's and 4's and focused my gold and iso on my 2's.  I had 6 teams ranked up in about 2 weeks.  Do what you want, but, like me, it seems like the 2's are more important to your strategy than the 4's are at this point.  They also take far less gold."

ContestOfChampions,3c8rwi,HumanFusion,2,Sun Jul 5 23:33:44 2015 UTC,"Level at least 5 teams (15 champs) to 3/30.  When you level up your champs, do them 3 at a time.  Until you max out the champs you want to use, you'll have to play much more than other players for the same results.  Once you max out your champs it should take between 80-115 wins to get a 3*.  The more in demand a champ is, the higher the score.  The Thursday-Saturday arenas are typically a little more competitive than the Monday-Wednesday ones.  Finally, scores are typically higher for new champs, and lower for ones who are already available.    Iron Patriot will likely be on the high end."
ContestOfChampions,3c8rwi,apatheticyeti0117,2,Mon Jul 6 01:53:21 2015 UTC,"Completely level all of your two stars. They changed the rules a while back and the high the pi the more points you get. So maxed out two stars will get more points than those at 2/20 or 3/1. Be sure to play all crystal cornucopia arenas to get more 2* champs. With a full compliment of maxed two stars, which is 30 of them, you should be able to pull ~50k per play through and meet the cutoff a for new champs more easily."
ContestOfChampions,3c8rwi,Obliwan,2,Mon Jul 6 02:12:25 2015 UTC,"In my experience getting 3s is pretty easy. If you have 8-9 teams the only thing you have to do is get figure ou how to get your streak started (opponents get stronger until 15 wins) and then to maintain it (after 15 enemies are quicker, but still easy once you are used to them. Them you need a streak of around 80-100 wins if most of your teams are maxed, or 100-120 otherwise (until this week I had 2 teams at 3/1 so 400PI and rest at 2/1 so 300PI). If you can manage that amount of wins you should have no problem winning heroes in 3 arena.  Personally I find staring the streak the hardest part especially wins 10-15 will have your 300PI guys fighting 500-600PI guys. I can often avoid it by using my lower teams until ~12-13 and use the stronger guys for the last bit. Occasionally I'll pay the 5units to get new opponents, since I'm confident enough I'll maintain the streak it's worth it. Other trick; after you picked your opponent but before starting the first fight, go to your champions tab and level them up. You get to fight with you leveled up guys :) and if you're planning to level up your 2*s anyway, it's no loss either."

To win a champ you need to put in ALOT of time, literally every 2 hours i was back and playing over this weekend, i lost sleep and did basically nothing else on my weekend off, if you want that arena champ you gotta put in time both in playing and upgrading your champs to tackle the harder opponents."

ContestOfChampions,3c8aol,koibroker,2,Sun Jul 5 21:01:15 2015 UTC,"People like leveling to 3/1 because you get an unblockable power at that level, but really, what you need to succeed in the arenas is to be able to continue streaks indefinitely, and for me that meant getting the 2-stars I was using to 300 power each (with masteries, it was normally 2/5 to 2/10). Ranking up past 300 does get you more points per fight, but if ISO is tight get all your teams to 300 then level them up 3 at a time from there. (You'd want to adjust this to the strength at which you can maintain streaks past match 15: if you're better than me, maybe you could do it with a lower number.) There are also about 30 2-stars available, so you can have up to 10 arena teams.   Ranking 3s is more time consuming, but so long as you're looking to be strategic right out of the gate, for the first two months you play, you'll be able to win 4*s in the arena much more easily (usually requiring about 1 million points to rank in the top 50 in your first month, or 1.5-2 million to rank in the top 100 in your second month). I only figured this out near the end of my second month, but if you're able to win a 4-star in two consecutive arenas, you get 120,000 ISO to use ranking up anyone and everyone. After month 2, it will be hugely costly in time, money, or likely both to take advantage of this feature, so racing towards that would give you a big boost."
ContestOfChampions,3c8aol,skreddy56,2,Sun Jul 5 21:24:30 2015 UTC,Thank you so much! This clarified a lot for me. I was always wondering why not to max out the 2* all the way to 3/30. it's a matter of opportunity cost then.  Can you elaborate more on getting that 120k ISO though? This is my first time hearing it. Can I do this while leveling up my 2? or do I use all my resources if I want to execute this 3  strategy properly.
ContestOfChampions,3c8aol,speedtck,2,Sun Jul 5 21:58:15 2015 UTC,"Useful tips from /u/skreddy56 but if you want to win 3star champions from the arena it would be more helpful if you max rank your 2stars instead of stopping at 3/1. With the new rules, the higher your champions' PI, the higher points you'll get.   Not in anyway discrediting /u/skreddy56 's useful tips and responses here though."
ContestOfChampions,3c8aol,skreddy56,1 point,Mon Jul 6 04:04:57 2015 UTC,"Have you duped any champions yet? They'll have silver stars, get an additional power, and as a bonus, you get a fair amount of free class-specific ISO at the same time you get the duplicate.   Duping a 2 star gives you 1975 class ISO, a 3 star gives 10,000, and a 4 star gives 120,000 (worth 180,000 if you use it on champs of the same class).   So, basically, you can get this bonus if you win the same 4-star champ in the back-to-back arenas that they normally run for each character. You'll be able to win new 3s in the arena with much less time invested than for 4s, but the structure of the brackets mean that at about 3 weeks in, you'll have the best roster for either arena in your bracket, and should have a serious advantage over most of your opponents in winning the top prize.   My best advice would be to play in both upcoming arenas with all your characters, and see where you fall. The other variables are how you want to spend the units you collect (on new crystals? On refreshing your top team in the arena?), whether or not you want to spend money, and how many times a day you can check in to run your teams (vs competing demands of job, family, sleep, etc.) Playing 6x a day, and assuming that you can get to 12 2s and 6 3s after Crystal Cornucopia, you should be able to get to about 200,000 in the 3-star arena and 300,000 in the 4-star arena. That will get you some premium crystals for sure, and maybe come close to winning the arena champ in the 3-star arena and a 3-star Crystal in the 4-star arena. Then you'll have a sense of how much more time, champs, or units you'd need to win the prizes you want. If going for the 4s is within the realm of what you can do, then go for it. If not, then build your roster of 3s (I would get dupes of 3-stars or 3-star crystals in the 4 star arena without going overboard) and reevaluate later."
ContestOfChampions,3c8aol,skreddy56,1 point,Sun Jul 5 22:33:41 2015 UTC,"Thank you! This helped a lot! As for ISOs, which would you recommend me to level up first tho? I only have one team of 3* so I don't know if that'll be enough to push for the 4* reward.  Also, any strategies to increase my win streak? I keep breaking it after 10-11 wins and I don't think that's good enough :( Any tips on how to order using 2*? and how to comprise a team?  Thanks again man!"
ContestOfChampions,3c8aol,skreddy56,1 point,Sun Jul 5 23:27:30 2015 UTC,"If you can get to a 10-11 streak before losing, you'll get 75-80% the points you would from keeping it running indefinitely. It sucks to lose the streak, but I can't keep one in the 4* arena under the new rules, and it's not really a problem.   I was just suggesting you see where you stand among current newbies by running in both at the same time: personally, I'd guess there was a big dropoff in number of players now that the big ultron (and App Store) promotion is over. 3-stars are going to be easier to win, so if you're a casual player (an hour or two a day) rank your 2s and win the new characters that way. But you'll be able to win 3s in arenas for the foreseeable future without having to spend any real money. If you're playing more (for example, if you're able to do 8+ rounds a day), you can win 4s this month with just time, while down the road you'll need time and money both. And, if you can win a duped pair of 4s once you get 2-3 teams of 3s, then you'll have enough ISO to rank a lot of characters all at once, an opportunity that is difficult to take advantage of later.   I've been playing for 3 months, and have won the 3-star champs in every arena since the 3.0 update, but I still only have 2 teams of 2s at rank 3 (loads at 2/20) because there are so many demands on ISO (and you get a lot less of it when you focus on arenas)."

It took a few tries to get the strategy right, but I eventually just started using units boosts and units to recharge my best team.   After that, as I used 7 teams all about 4000-4200 PI and got in as many rounds as possible. Ideally I'd like to have 8 teams all maxed out, but you work with what you have.   I ended up doing about 300-320 matches with a 247 win streak.  One you get enough teams, the 4* arena is just about time. This was the first time my schedule lined up with a champ I really want."

Last question if you don't mind; how strong was the team you used to get past the 5/50s? and how strong were those approximately?

I have iron fist and colossus, neither of them duped and only 1 alpha cat to level them up. Will see if that works otherwise I'll just have to see how far I can get with just resetting my streak every 10-12 fights :P.  Btw, what might work (at least it does in 3* arena) to avoid the MMX teams, is to do fights 10-13 with very low champs. In my experience fighting a 650 with a 350 is not that bad, which is what I usually get at around streak 12. You could even level them up after setting up the matching but before the actual fight (though that only works a few times of course).  In any case, thanks for all the info!"

ContestOfChampions,3c8c6o,Sylgamesh,1 point,Mon Jul 6 04:06:47 2015 UTC,"I played a lot. I had a slow work from home day on Thursday, off Friday and Saturday and I told my wife ahead of time I was planning to give this a shot and that I wouldn't have a lot of free time. Once I got past the hard matchups my 7 teams took 30-45 mins for a full round (depending on how distracted I got).   I didn't sleep a ton the first couple nights, maybe 4 hrs or so. But I only normally sleep 5-6 hrs a night so it wasn't a big sacrifice.   Thanks man. I fully intend to get at least one more team and level up more of the teams I'm using now. Just need to farm enough ISO. I think with 8 teams you could hit 4M+ without units at all, or spend some units and not spend so much time playing."

ContestOfChampions,3c6udp,WitchBxtchOfficial,1 point,Sun Jul 5 12:21:22 2015 UTC,"Colossus and his armor I can make do with, though it is annoying. The other two do drive me insane, the proc rates on healing and unstoppable are a bit ridiculous. Generally if I get one of those in a 3v3 match up I'll assume a loss, throw my weakest guy at them, and preserve my two stronger heroes for the other two match ups.  Healing and unstoppable both seem to proc on a per-hit basis, so ideally you'd want to counter it with slow, heavy, single hits to reduce their frequency but...this game doesn't really have that. Your specials do that but you've got to build up the resources to use them first. Otherwise the only other idea I can think of is Scarlet Witch's nullify...it helps, but not enough."
ContestOfChampions,3c6udp,anthem47,1 point,Sun Jul 5 12:27:15 2015 UTC,A good strategy against both of these is to do 4 hit combos on them while they block (5th hit exposes you to counter attack). Blocked hits don't proc abilities. It's been forever since I've lost against Juggs/Unst Colossus or Wolverine in arenas by doing this.
ContestOfChampions,3c6udp,oproski,1 point,Sun Jul 5 17:46:53 2015 UTC,So when they aren't blocking and you are hitting them you just immediately lay off? I don't have a problem going in for a 4 hit combo while they're blocking because like you said it doesn't proc abilities...my problem is when I'm trying to get a combo going where I am hitting them and they break it with unstoppable...how are you supposed to deal with this??
ContestOfChampions,3c6udp,kedge91,1 point,Mon Jul 6 13:43:43 2015 UTC,"It's really tough, but what I do is stare at the right side of the screen when attacking and as soon as I see unstoppable appear, tap block. Sometimes their first hit doesn't register if you're in the middle of a combo, and you can avoid being hit at all if you block fast enough. Then dodge and start again lol."
ContestOfChampions,3c6udp,oproski,0,Mon Jul 6 15:46:48 2015 UTC,"Using heavy attacks instead of combos does a really good job against wolverine.   Hulk busters uppercut has helped me kill highly duped wolverines, pin them in the corner and heavy attack over and over then finish with an L3"

ContestOfChampions,3c6n7m,knightzeemo,4,Sun Jul 5 09:50:31 2015 UTC,"Actual pro tip: Keep 2500 battle chips in your inventory at all times so you'll know you have enough on Sunday for the Crystal Cornucopia.  It's a special arena that only awards 2star champs (up to 4) and costs 2500 battle chips just to be able to play it.  Other than that, save your crystals to open on the dupe day (the Alliance event called Draw Duplicates)."
ContestOfChampions,3c6n7m,Jasepstein,3,Sun Jul 5 15:28:33 2015 UTC,"The first milestone is super low for the Sunday Crystal Cornucopia event too. I can usually get it in about 3 rounds, so it's good for even new players to trade 2500 battle chips for a guaranteed 2*. Great way to expand your roster if you're just starting out."
ContestOfChampions,3c6n7m,cruise02,4,Mon Jul 6 13:47:18 2015 UTC,"Units are hard to come by. For the most part, buying premium crystals is a waste.   As you play, you can get an offer for a 3* offer for 400 units and a 4* offer for 2500 units. I prefer those deals. Also, when you have enough mastery points, you can get stony cores for 135 units that help unlock stronger masteries.  The temporary special crystals often are not worthwhile either. They cost 150-175 units, and most of the time you just get a 2* anyway.   Battle chips and alliance loyalty points can be spent whenever you want, though, like Jasephstein said, you want to always have 2500 battle chips saved for the crystal cornucopia."

ContestOfChampions,3c5hqm,astrospeedyj,0,Sun Jul 5 00:19:48 2015 UTC,"Maybe you should try putting something in the FAQ as a guideline.

ContestOfChampions,3c5hqm,C4NN1B41,2,Sun Jul 5 01:54:10 2015 UTC,I really enjoy and anticipate those posts. No matter what you do you'll still have those people asking what the cut offs are.

ContestOfChampions,3c5hqm,subredditor41,2,Sun Jul 5 01:51:33 2015 UTC,Best indicator imo is previous results. Tracking the cutoffs for every arena somewhere would be cool.
ContestOfChampions,3c5hqm,subredditor41,1 point,Sun Jul 5 03:02:17 2015 UTC,"You also need to factor in how desired champions are. The cutoffs for a 3* black panther are going to be way different than a Dr strange. Do you mean previous results of an arena for the same champ? In that case, the scores would still probably increase a little, due to the ever increasing goals"
ContestOfChampions,3c5hqm,Thekobra,2,Sun Jul 5 03:33:25 2015 UTC,"As an example I think for Scarlet Witch you could have compared it to a recent arena featuring a champ already in the game. I started with the Abomination cutoff and went from there. Tweak a little for how good/coveted the champ is, whether we're coming off a string of grindy arenas where people might be looking for a breather (which happened with Scarlet Witch during her first arena), nothing scientific but I've always done it this way. I'm too lazy to record the cutoffs though and just go off memory, not the best."
ContestOfChampions,3c5hqm,Thekobra,1 point,Sun Jul 5 07:46:30 2015 UTC,"FWIW I have absolutely no idea what the Capt Am cutoff will be. I'd think low due to people like me who didn't play on holiday, but the US is obviously not the entire player pool. He is a ""new"" one time deal and a decent champ imo, thought I saw he'll have stun, so if I had to guess I'd say 12500th place will be about 500k."
ContestOfChampions,3c5hqm,Z-Formation,2,Sun Jul 5 07:52:05 2015 UTC,"Solid idea if one of the mods is up to it. That said, I don't think it's really necessary. I don't really mind the multiple posts.

This has significantly helped me manage my time and expectations."

ContestOfChampions,3c6hnw,turkeyjr,1 point,Sun Jul 5 23:35:23 2015 UTC,You didn't give enough information to definitely help you. Take a picture of your bracket each week and post it. Then people can tell you what you are in.  The developers change the rules of the game all the time. All the players can do is try and keep up.

ContestOfChampions,3c5inj,SKxB,1 point,Sun Jul 5 08:04:12 2015 UTC,"Level up that Dupe Colossus and use him to take out the wolverine.  That's pretty much what i did when I was first starting out.  Keep attacking Wolverine even when he blocks, he can't trigger regen when he blocks.  Save up for a Lvl 3 and try to use it with armor up.    If you complete both paths you automatically get a catalyst for the exploration bonus.  Once you get the catalysts, rank up and max out Colossus.  It takes awhile, but he was my best hero against him until I got some 3* and 4* tech heroes."

Your best bet it to upgrade your dup colossus, he is great against wolverine due to he cant bleed and his special will knock a lot of points of wolverine. My team to beat it was  3* iron man  3* hawkeye 3* Dup juggernaut  3* Cyclops  3* Thor  Once you do it once it becomes so easy to do :)"

Anyways, don't waste time on the easy path, just do it once for the exploration.  Make sure you get 1 run in the Hard Path + 1  run in the Easy, then just keep trying on the Hard path.   Also do it on the daily basis to guarantee at least 1 tier 3 basic Cat per day. The other runs are just pure luck. Focus on the one its guaranteed (exploration reward)."

ContestOfChampions,3c59fe,AMilitantPeanut,1 point,Sat Jul 4 23:02:27 2015 UTC,Obviously the long game is to level all of them. It just takes so much ISO to level 3/4* champs and I have four mystic champs to work with. I'd rather choose one to focus on then worry about the rest later.

I don't know if they look at the party PI or the individual PI of each character, but if they all are 300 or above, you will never have that happen (the AI having more PI than you)."
ContestOfChampions,3c3c11,DhamonGrimwulf,1 point,Sun Jul 5 15:23:48 2015 UTC,It works for as low as 200 PI as well. By my theory it's champions that are at 1/10 and up. (Haven't used anyone below 1/10 during god-mode AI yet)

ContestOfChampions,3c2vpm,joshualeet,6,Sat Jul 4 06:24:22 2015 UTC,"A way of getting units is just playing the story, you get some for doing a run through a act once (5 im pretty sure) and then 15? when you 100% it. You can get more units by playing the 3v3 arenas, getting some of the milestones done(when you can), and use Battlechips for the arena crystal and that'll get you some gold/units and a chance for Punisher. Every 10 Premium crystals you open, you get a offer for a 3* crystal, thats 400 units. The 2500 unit one is the 4* crystal and it pops up seemingly randomly when you open some 3* crystals.  Generally now you're gonna wanna level up your characters whenever you can. For the arena, every time you win you're gonna get harder opponents, so if you rank them up it won't be very hard. Every sunday, the arena does a special event where you can use all of your champions (1* 2* etc,) called Crystal cornucopia and you get some 2* hero crystals for hitting some of the milestones. Since you're new it's best to do this and get some extra heros / dupes.  Sorry if it doesn't help, I'm sure someone else can come in and correct me or give better info."

ContestOfChampions,3c2vpm,UnreachableOne,3,Sat Jul 4 06:43:28 2015 UTC,"Arenas give battlechips, you get about 10 a battle. If you do 3v3 and win the 3 matches you get about 300 from the chest it gives. You can do the 1v1s for some too but the same 10 payout. If you can do the milestones for the arenas you can get some decent battlechips for not THAT much work.  Also, I forgot to mention but the Crystal Cornucopia has a buy-in of 2,500 battlechips so make sure to save up."
ContestOfChampions,3c2vpm,CkyLaurence,1 point,Sat Jul 4 06:47:52 2015 UTC,"Ahh okay okay, makes sense. Well then that's what I'll be focusing on.

Don't be quick to quit your alliance while you're finding your comfortable play level, unless it never hits milestones. Some are very quick to kick. You want to play arenas as much as you're able while your account is still in the beginner bracket. Play the hell out of Cornucopia on Sundays to build your team, but I wouldn't even open any Premium Crystals until you have at least 400 units saved. Save your dailies for dupe day."

ContestOfChampions,3c2vpm,UnreachableOne,2,Sat Jul 4 18:17:36 2015 UTC,"Right now your goal is to do as many fights as you can in the 3v3 arena. Depending on how new you are, you should see an arena for Captain America, followed by Rhino. Those are super easy arenas that will net you the 3* champs. If you don't see those arenas, then unfortunately you missed out on two really easy 3*s.  As for ranking up, it's really the only way to progress through the arenas and storyline; knock yourself out!  The 2500 units is for a 4* Crystal offer that pops up once you've opened so many 3* champs from crystals. For as young as your roster is, I would instead save up 400 units for when the 3* Crystal offer pops up and buy those instead until you've got a few 3*s on your team."

But yeah man, good tips and definitely cleared things up for me. I was really unsure of what I really needed to be playing so I was just going through and 100%ing the story.   Is the stamina of your character related to your quest energy? It seems like once I run out of that, I can no longer fight in the arenas. So should I just be spending most of my time fighting the 3 star 3v3 arena? I probably shouldn't spend units on regaining stamina, yeah? I ask for help from my alliance, but it seems that I never actually get anything back from that."

My guess is that 1million will get you somewhere in 11-50, 1.5 million should have a good shot at top 10"
ContestOfChampions,3c2u9l,anthonyberkers,2,Sat Jul 4 06:20:05 2015 UTC,1-10 would be closer to 5 million if not higher then that. Trust me.

ContestOfChampions,3bzz99,arfcom,3,Fri Jul 3 15:02:31 2015 UTC,I should keep track of how many chips I have spent. I know it's been a lot and still no 4 * punisher
ContestOfChampions,3bzz99,EXEOrd66,2,Fri Jul 3 17:49:58 2015 UTC,"This drop rate for units was a little low.    Since I started keeping data, I have 1,005 units on 300 arena crystals opened. An average of 3.35 units / crystal.  I like to keep track of this so I can estimate where I'm at in units while I wait a month or so to open Arena crystals between Crystal Crash events.  (of note, zero Punishers have been awarded during these most recent 300 arena crystals, but I do have 4 star Punisher and double-duped 3 star so I can't complain.)"
ContestOfChampions,3bzz99,Satchmo84,2,Fri Jul 3 15:17:58 2015 UTC,"Well, at least you're only 1000 units away from a 4* crystal"
ContestOfChampions,3bzz99,Satchmo84,2,Fri Jul 3 17:25:58 2015 UTC,Yes that's the plan.  May get tempted by stoney cores 1st though.

ContestOfChampions,3bzz99,Satchmo84,2,Fri Jul 3 19:06:41 2015 UTC,Does this only show up once you have 2500 units? Because I do not see anywhere to buy a 4 star crystal for 2500 units.
ContestOfChampions,3bzz99,DhamonGrimwulf,1 point,Sat Jul 4 06:38:45 2015 UTC,It shows up after you've Open 10 three-star characters I believe.

ContestOfChampions,3c2h2f,NinjaNick125,7,Sat Jul 4 03:39:16 2015 UTC,PC's are given out almost like candy. A lot of people can pull 10-15 of them a week ( not including alliance event rewards) plus the 2* crystals from Sunday's arena. You shouldn't be paying for them at all.
ContestOfChampions,3c2h2f,Barrenhammer,2,Sat Jul 4 04:21:12 2015 UTC,I don't know how you get that many because I play everyday and it's very rare if I even get 2 or 3 by the end of the week. What do you do to get so many?
ContestOfChampions,3c2h2f,Barrenhammer,0,Sat Jul 4 04:26:43 2015 UTC,"2 from 3* arena milestones & 2 more from rank rewards. 1 from 4* arena milestone & 1 or 2 from rank rewards. Lowball of 6, times 2 arenas per week. 4x 2* crystals from Sunday arena, and 2-3 PC from rank rewards."
ContestOfChampions,3c2h2f,xenithflare,4,Sat Jul 4 04:31:00 2015 UTC,"See, I can't do the 4* arena so I lose out on those milestones and rank rewards and I don't have enough 2* and 3* characters to get good milestones when it comes to the noobie arena. So at the moment, I'm kinda screwed."

ContestOfChampions,3c2a8a,NinjaNick125,1 point,Sat Jul 4 02:56:46 2015 UTC,The fact that I could take out an opponent over 3x my PI without a single point of damage.

ContestOfChampions,3c2a8a,y2j_lionsault,2,Sat Jul 4 03:28:11 2015 UTC,His L1 has power burn which prevents the opponent from ever getting a L3. You can dodge everything else.
ContestOfChampions,3c14fd,WayOfWade3x,4,Fri Jul 3 20:21:41 2015 UTC,"Only way I can cope is to limit my play.  I'll either commit to just the 3* or milestones only and do both events.    -Look up some hand/wrist stretches for gamers or carpal tunnel and do them before or after you play  -Limit a session to as short as you can (ie: do your 3* run take a 5-10 min break and stretch, then do the 4*)  -Don't stay in one position and play, I'll do a few fights and change my body position.  -Ibuprofen helps reduce inflammation"

What I do is I take small 1-2 min breaks between each fight. I play the arena when I'm playing other games, so like if I'm dead in a game and it's going to take a min or 2 to revive I'll do a match or two depending on time. Or just watch a movie while you're playing and look up at the movie every now and then so it's not constant strain. Doing this I haven't encountered any sort of strain on my hands."

ContestOfChampions,3bzg6x,oojellah,1 point,Sat Jul 4 21:47:53 2015 UTC,Who want's to micro-manage? I sure don't and I bet anyone who agree doesn't either. But when you join certain alliance one of the things they ask is that you save all your crystals. You don't have to join it. It's a choice but people join them because they want to leach off other people's efforts and that is what is not right about this game. If you want to join an alliance with no organization or system then by all means nobody is stoping you. It's when you join an alliance because it's higher rated so you don't have to work as hard. It's not fair to the players who want to work together. That simple.
ContestOfChampions,3bzg6x,Deleosx,2,Sat Jul 4 21:49:56 2015 UTC,I agree to the point of showing who is opening what..  This would make things much easier to control who is a team player and who isn't.
ContestOfChampions,3bzg6x,bobiel,2,Sat Jul 4 01:39:41 2015 UTC,Pro tip: you can check that by looking at the player scores.
ContestOfChampions,3bzg6x,skreddy56,2,Fri Jul 3 12:59:23 2015 UTC,"On one hand I get OP's point, but I have to disagree.   This sounds like it happened yesterday - in the midst of a multi-day crystal event AND a Dupe Day. So if the issue is someone opening a big crystal ""off cycle"" the only thing that means is your Alliance had already achieved all the goals for both Crystal Crash and Dupe Day. And it's a big Alliance so I'm sure that's true. Cheers! But then you're asking people to save Crystals for... Some mythical multi-day Dupe event we haven't seen in a few weeks. Kabam has said they are pulling back on the multi day Alliance events. So you're asking people to hoard for something that may not come along for a long time. (The same holds true for Rank Ups too). So if you're not on the game the SECOND the event starts in a big alliance, you ""lose"" the opportunity to open crystals, etc, because of you do, you're seen as not a team player, and you get an Officer yelling about it on chat and here on Reddit.   TLDR; it's a game. Being strategic with your Alliance is great, but it's also fun - and part of the game - to open crystals."
ContestOfChampions,3bzg6x,DansMuayThaiMMA,2,Fri Jul 3 15:06:24 2015 UTC,"I have to say, this feature is a necessity if Kabam wants to keep alliances competitive and an essential part of the game.     If a player wants to join an alliance, they are free to do so, but if an alliance has certain requirements then this feature will be a lot of help for the officers. If your alliance is very competitive then this feature will be a very valuable tool to see who is actually contributing to the success. It can see who are freeloaders and who are working their asses off!      I'm all for players being relaxed, casual or hardcore, but then you should find an alliance that fits your needs. This feature can separate those who want to cheat the system!"
ContestOfChampions,3bzg6x,skreddy56,4,Fri Jul 3 17:21:19 2015 UTC,"Bad idea, if someone wants to open a cristal outside of alliance event, he is free to do that !!!"

ContestOfChampions,3bzg6x,DhamonGrimwulf,-1,Fri Jul 3 12:10:31 2015 UTC,The question is your team winning the current alpha? We will win by default but trust me it could have been a lot easier to manage crystal spends. If anyone in your team spent a 4 star outside this event...do you know they cost your team 25k points? Think about your statement. You are saying to people do what you want when you want but try to play as team? How can you win as a team with individuals not understanding the impact of what they do. If they knew that would help the team in huge ways they wouldn't do it! Also if you open a 4 star crystal outside this event...how will you ever get catalysts for it when you can't score enough because people aren't educated on spending crystals when everything is connected?

ContestOfChampions,3bzg6x,grathan,1 point,Fri Jul 3 13:26:19 2015 UTC,"Just keep track of the number of characters and rating of alliance members. You can see if the 3/4 that was opened was a dupe, and if it wasn't, you can see whose character count increased.  Much easier, though, to just give alliance members a target score.

That's exactly what we do.  Were you in F.o.C.?  Bring 100 points to the table and I don't care what you open.  Makes for a much more pleasant environment where people don't have to get mad every time they see a crystal popped.  Of course now that the 3* reward is gone it's hard to justify getting too riled up about that last milestone either way."

Right now the new rule is not only get the minimums in the daily's but save all 3 star rank ups for multi rank up events and save all hero crystals for major events as well. You will need to score only the minimum. If that sounds good to you return  my message with I get your strategy of saving all hero crystals and 3 star rank ups for major events and you agree to only score the minimum points needed as a member unless asked.

The second alliance is reaching 700k right now and there are 20 and 30ks joining that group. Let me know what your rating is i can't find you on search function. can you give me the alliance name and we can look you up.

If you don't like it don't buy it, and if you have an inherent problem with game companies making money then I suggest you stop playing the game and have a think about how it's possible to make a large-scale game without making any money from it."
ContestOfChampions,3c3av4,hazzamadazzla,8,Sat Jul 4 12:08:59 2015 UTC,I am not sure OP will understand your reason and logic. He may feel he deserves 4* with every crystal.
ContestOfChampions,3c3av4,slumpsox,8,Sat Jul 4 14:41:48 2015 UTC,"No wool over my eyes. A 3* Crystal typically costs 400 units. A lot of time goes into getting 400 units, way more than $5 worth of my time. I was glad to fork over $5 to a company who's made a game I enjoy playing for a guaranteed 3* (which ended up being an Iron Fist) AND 135 units.  No con. Console games are $60. This one is free. I've paid a total of $7 for alot of entertained hours."

ContestOfChampions,3c12ll,LamarBourbon,3,Fri Jul 3 20:06:57 2015 UTC,"It wouldn't be an advantage, simply because the higher PI your champion is, the more points you get. It just makes sense to max out your champions if you can."

ContestOfChampions,3c12ll,grathan,1 point,Fri Jul 3 21:58:06 2015 UTC,Unless you didn't have enough iso to go aroundand you had weaker players that always lose. In that case you would get more points by having more teams to extend the streaks by upgrading the weaklings instead of the OPs.
ContestOfChampions,3c12ll,brocalmotion,0,Sat Jul 4 14:42:02 2015 UTC,Stupid question: most of my 2stars are ~ 3/7. If I max them will I get more points per match?

Still, the sig is supposed to be a perfect block that increases it's chance anytime your opponent has a positive buff. I suppose it would make him a good foil for Dr. Strange. But since there won't be a dupe arena, it will be a long while before most have a chance to try it out."
ContestOfChampions,3c0yvj,skreddy56,1 point,Fri Jul 3 19:54:29 2015 UTC,"IIRC, Kabam said that they'd release another limited crystal along with the Iron Patriot arena on Monday, one that contains Cap."

For an alpha cat, just sit back and wait for Kabam to give another freebie like they did for Ultron event completion.  Also look for next Catalyst Clash alpha and see if they give one as a milestone reward.  If so then you can get there with some dedication."

I'm not sure how this one will be, given the U.S. holiday though. And I don't think cap is the most popular champion to play as....SW is awesome, especially duped.   Many who already had her may have went hard the second arena, thinking they could dupe her easily as the second arena is usually less competitive."

ContestOfChampions,3bztyu,Mossy013,1 point,Fri Jul 3 14:15:58 2015 UTC,"Also I don't think that the 4* are givin in the beginning to get them hooked, Could be but It a Normal reality where new people start and then kabamm drops a whole new story line like Ultron. How other than to give the new guys a fighting chance to get through their story line sucessfully with a strong enough character. Reason being said that they are releasing the new Ant Man story quest. So i would assume the all the sudden drop of 4* would be due to the upcoming quest.  Anyone else agree?  Lol but trust me im not saying Kaboom is actually lending a hand to the needy! I figure thats the way to get them hooked. To get them through the Antman quests. Then their HOOKED!"
ContestOfChampions,3bztyu,Nemogtr,1 point,Sat Jul 4 11:49:35 2015 UTC,"I don't understand comparing yourself to the top players in the game.  That's a mythical level of achievement that no sane person would even want to be part of.    There appears to be some weird psychology in some people to where if they can't win the 4 star they want in arena then the game is rigged and a failure and then they usually quit the game.  It's just a fact of life that you don't get to win 4 stars in arena in the vet bracket so just let it go.  Winning  3 stars? No big deal to get that done.  Saving for a 4 star?  Takes a month or so.  Getting the cats to rank them up?  You ever checked the milestone rewards in those catalyst clash events? Doable.  Alpha cats?  All you had to do was finish Ultron to get one.  Again no big deal.  Winning fun characters, being in an enjoyable alliance, advancing your roster all the time, all this is doable without being BrutalDX."
ContestOfChampions,3bztyu,arfcom,3,Fri Jul 3 14:46:23 2015 UTC,"When you have been playing the game since the start, you will understand how dishearting the game can be to loyal players. Open over 3000 crystals and never get a 4* try to say its fair, get a win streak over 140 and have 2 million points and miss out on the 4* champ. Ah with the catalysts you need special ones to get them, in a fun alliance I made one. Yes the game can be enjoyable but the main point of playing it is to be the best."
ContestOfChampions,3bztyu,GiftOfTheGame,4,Fri Jul 3 14:56:10 2015 UTC,I'm with you. Shoot that note directly to kabam after adjusting spelling. It's the only way to get something to change - going right to the source.
ContestOfChampions,3bztyu,Lealdini,1 point,Fri Jul 3 15:01:09 2015 UTC,"I agree with you in some parts about the % of 4* drops but also agree with arfcom.

A LOT OF TIME!"

ContestOfChampions,3bwcrq,rhikiri,3,Thu Jul 2 20:07:24 2015 UTC,"When you open a crystal and receive a 2/3/4 star hero that you already have, it is a dupe (duplicate).  That ""awakens"" the hero and gives it another ability.  Their stars will now be silver instead of bronze colored.  Dupe day is an alliance event that you get points for drawing a duplicate hero, so people will save their hero crystals for that event and then open them.    You don't have any control over if you have duplicates or not, it's just random, but once you have been playing for a long time, it is inevitable."
ContestOfChampions,3bwcrq,rhikiri,1 point,Thu Jul 2 20:15:55 2015 UTC,"Thank you for the clear response. Is there any way to keep the dupes instead or ""fusing"" them?"
ContestOfChampions,3bwcrq,rhikiri,2,Thu Jul 2 20:37:12 2015 UTC,"No there isn't.  You can have multiple of the same hero, but only when they are different rarity (1/2/3/4 star).  When a hero duplicates, it gets converted into the new ability and varying amounts of class specific ISO.  A 2 star gives you two 825 ISO and one 325 ISO.  A 3 star gives you two 5000 ISO"

ContestOfChampions,3bwh6l,C4NN1B41,1 point,Thu Jul 2 19:04:46 2015 UTC,A duped UC close to max (I assume 3 star) is almost sufficient to defeat thanos...but SW is stellar when duped.
ContestOfChampions,3bwh6l,robcan,1 point,Thu Jul 2 19:24:07 2015 UTC,"You can solo Thanos with either one, to be honest. It matters what your preference is. DS can use his rotating buffs to stay healthy and constantly Tier 3 Thanos. Meanwhile, SW relies heavily on crits to proc so she can get as many special effects as she can as well as her innate chance to nullify Thanos' armor. Depending on what the percent chance you have on her awakened ability should really determine if she is worth leveling for Thanos first (as well as your personal playstyle)."
ContestOfChampions,3bwh6l,ChillFactory,0,Thu Jul 2 20:41:40 2015 UTC,"Dr. Strange, no question. I have a 3* maxed and he can solo the entire Thanos mission including Thanos himself on a good day."

ContestOfChampions,3bwh6l,MisterInTheGame,0,Fri Jul 3 16:50:13 2015 UTC,"I can do the same thing, and mine is not duped.  When I beat all the cosmic champions in the level with Dr. Strange and got to Thanos, I decided to use SW to see how strong she is. Her ability is level 32 for me, which means I have a 99.2% chance of proccing her ability. Problem with that is, it's all random. I got half of his health off (and he got only 2 hits on me, blocked the rest), but I got no regen from SW's signature so she died.  The run before that I solo'd Thanos with only Dr. Strange, so I'd say Strange all the way."

ContestOfChampions,3bxfru,vietnamese_jesus,1 point,Thu Jul 2 23:15:57 2015 UTC,"it appears some things have changed recently. A couple of theories I've heard: don't use non-rank 4s until after about 20, and don't mix the ranks if you use anything lower than 3 star rank 4 (e.g. 3 of rank 3 or 3 of rank 4 are fine, 1 rank 4 and 2 rank 3 or other combinations of different ranks are not safe)"
ContestOfChampions,3bxfru,johnreddit,0,Fri Jul 3 00:43:54 2015 UTC,So basically streak of 20 instead of 15.. That sucks
ContestOfChampions,3bxfru,johnreddit,1 point,Fri Jul 3 00:55:54 2015 UTC,not really. supposedly if you use high level guys at 16 you still get easy. just avoid anything lower than rank 4 until after 20. Even after 20 try to avoid mixing ranks and stay above ~1.2k PI. Again this is just from things I've heard from people who have been able to maintain streak. There's no confirmation
ContestOfChampions,3bxfru,johnreddit,0,Fri Jul 3 01:08:23 2015 UTC,That worked for last arena.. I did use rank 4 this arena but i started streak 15 with all rank 4/1 and got hard opponents
ContestOfChampions,3bxfru,arfcom,2,Fri Jul 3 01:25:35 2015 UTC,Maybe 4/1 is still a bit too low.  I'm at 18 now with only 4 stars and max 3 stars.  Not going to try using anything lower until after 20 like what my Alliance said. Several people in my Alliance were already over 40 wins so I know it's doable.  Just need to trial and error and find the new threshold
ContestOfChampions,3bxfru,johnreddit,1 point,Fri Jul 3 02:14:33 2015 UTC,"Interesting.  Thanks for feedback.  Like the rest of you my maxed 3 stars and rank 2+ 4 stars get the easy match, but I haven't gotten to match 20 yet due to my 3/30 3 stars getting the matchup of doom.  If these 3/30 three stars are safe after 20 then that would be very helpful and worth waiting on the refresh of my only 2 teams above that to get me through 16-20."
ContestOfChampions,3bxfru,arfcom,2,Fri Jul 3 15:54:46 2015 UTC,seems like it does work. I'm at streak 61 right now. The first 20 matches or so I used only 4* and 3* max. After that I added the rest of the 3* rank 4s at about 1-1.2k PI. so far no problems.
ContestOfChampions,3bxfru,johnreddit,1 point,Fri Jul 3 18:49:09 2015 UTC,Working for me too.  What's the lowest PI you've ran out past matc 20?
ContestOfChampions,3bxfru,arfcom,1 point,Sat Jul 4 04:40:37 2015 UTC,I haven't been brave enough to go below 3 star rank 4. My lowest rank 4 lvl 1 guys are just above 1k PI. I also use a couple of 1.2k PI guys with each 1k PI champ to get close to about 3.5k total which I heard could also have an effect on this. So far everything looks good even if I just have 9 teams to play with. Broke 100 streak a bit earlier and still working flawlessly. If anyone here is brave enough to try a few runs with a team of only rank 3 guys let me know :)
ContestOfChampions,3bxfru,arfcom,1 point,Sat Jul 4 07:12:48 2015 UTC,My 3/30 guys are working but I've only been using the ones over 1100. Will experiment further later with lower guys.
ContestOfChampions,3bxfru,Thekobra,1 point,Sat Jul 4 13:14:37 2015 UTC,"Can confirm that the easy matchups work for 4 star 1/10s. Mine are about 1050 PI, paired 2 with a 1050 3 star 3/30.   Next matchup I used a 3star Widow 3/12 at 1074 PI and the easy streak continues. Will try to test further down at end of arena."

It will be interesting to see if they offer 2 star versions of Ant-Man and Yellowjacket in the Alliance Events as others have mentioned.  But you're correct in saying that a lot of the more recent heroes do NOT have 2-star counterparts:  Daredevil, Dr. Strange, Ms. Marvel, Captain Marvel, Ultron, Rocket Raccoon, Magneto and probably more.  Not to mention the fact that you can't get Deadpool without spending $10, with only ONE opportunity to buy him.   Agree, time for some more new 2-stars."

ContestOfChampions,3bubx5,x3rr_le_morge,3,Thu Jul 2 09:38:58 2015 UTC,"The gold calculations are the total gold needed for rank ups to get a character from their current rank to their max rank. For example, a brand new 3* Scarlet witch has to be ranked up three times to go from rank 1 to rank 4. with this in mind, the calculator adds up the cost to go to rank 2 (11,400 gold), rank 3 (22,301 gold) and rank 4 (34,501 gold) and provides that total (68,302  gold)."
ContestOfChampions,3bubx5,anthonyberkers,1 point,Thu Jul 2 15:57:36 2015 UTC,"This is a really nice chart and I will personally be using it to track my catalyst farming, however I won't be using your figures for gold I'm sorry. The problem with estimating gold costs to level up your champs is that it's not always the same - each iso size has a slightly different iso to gold ratio and the bigger the iso, the less it costs in gold to level up. In addition to this, class iso uses considerably less gold to level up the same amount. So depending on the combination of iso used to get from level 1 to max the gold cost is always going to be different."
ContestOfChampions,3bubx5,Streloma,4,Thu Jul 2 10:17:01 2015 UTC,Streloma is right. I thought about trying to calculate the ISO/gold cost but it was just too much of an undertaking. This is just the total gold costs for the needed rank ups to get a champ to max rank.

I would recommend 2/20 if you can win with them. 10 teams total and about 4400 pts per match.   For reference- I earned about 10% more with the 3/10s, but it takes so many cats/ISO/gold to rank them all to 3/10 or especially 3/30, so I suggest putting that to 3* champs instead. Plus with 2/20 you do not fight as many rank 3s, even at 90 win streak its mostly rank 2 that you battle so no L3 special to watch out for."

That said, you won't get good prizes in the arenas with those heroes. Definitely want to get folks to at least rank 3; I find a 400 PI and above make for decent streaks (20-30+, depending on how crazy the AI is behaving).  The bigger benefit is that you get more points per fight, thus more points to clear the milestones and be competitive for the 3* hero prize."

ContestOfChampions,3bu2qt,Dernhart,1 point,Thu Jul 2 05:13:01 2015 UTC,"You can't dashback though when the AI can dash forward the same distance, faster than you and still hit you. Then the do their 5+ hit combo, which only the AI can do. Aaaaaand... those times the game decides that you were not blocking, my favourite is the WS first power attack, where you block the first 2 and then whilst still blocking, he shoots you an you go down."

At Match 15, the difference between your average PI and the opponents average PI will be at it's greatest.  On Match 16, the PI drops back down but the AI goes up.  You'll now basically be fighting ""hard"" bots as opposed to ""easy"" bots, but their PI will be lower.  On the hard matches, you have to block/dodge to bait out their L1/L2 abilities and their strong attacks(uppercuts) and counter attack appropriately."
ContestOfChampions,3bu2qt,AREYOUSauRuS,3,Thu Jul 2 12:35:26 2015 UTC,"Warning: This is conjecture on my part  This relates to the 3* Arena (not 4* arena)  I've been able to sustain 77 wins in a row on the current Scarlet Witch Bitch Arena, I had a 93 win streak on the previous SB arena, as well as 101 on the second Magneto. Yes I noticed the AI is harder, and yes, it seems at times the AI difficulty waxes and wanes between: Moderate, Hard, & Insane. I've managed to slice out wins and keep my streak because I found a pattern to the madness.   The Pattern:  Moderate: The AI fights with the normal level of the tournament or old style when the individual opponents are rank 3/15-3/30  Hard: The AI fights with a lot of blocks and a good mix of heavy/medium attacks as well as quick use of it's L3 Attack when the opponents are level 3/5-3/15  Insane: The AI fights like Thanos, filled with the seizure blocking, lots of punishing combos, and banking their power until it's L3 attack when the opponent is between level 2/20-3/4   I've noticed that if the opponents PI Index is below 1300 they will have at least 1 Hard/Insane opponent and usually 1-2 Moderate opponents. Make sure to inspect the opponents level and if you see it's rank is below 3/5,  know you're going to be fighting the insane AI and need to be more conservative with your style (i.e. blocking and dodging back, making quick strikes, and being patient letting your hit points and higher level win for you). If the opponent is a duped 3/10 make sure to adjust accordingly for darting and quick strikes."

Now it's work to get to 40. Doesn't matter the PI, it seems to go from ""This is easy"" to ""We'll let you tromp our first two guys, but no way you're getting a perfect"" to ""You do not get to win"". Have to completely change my fighting style and be more defensive (which I admit, I'm not as good at).  It reminds me of the one on one versus fights when you get a long streak, except that instead of getting ridiculous PI opponents, the AI just turns it up to 11."

ContestOfChampions,3bu2qt,Ghostman_Loon,2,Thu Jul 2 23:18:24 2015 UTC,"I notice the AI gets much harder around 15-20, or maybe I am just not that good at this game.  Sometimes, right before the AI gets super hard (beats you even though your points are much higher) - you get opponents whose points are much, much higher than yours. i.e. I'm level 1/2 fighting a level 3 rank 30. You can hit them over and over again, but they'll build up their level 3 special move over and over and because it's unblockable you'll eventually just die (for me it's typically after 1 hit).

Its to the point that I've waited this long to try to get 4 UC and this represents my best chance and I would be seriously upset if I cash out and they run it a week later.  Since holding them though I found my interest waning, grind less, and not sure if its general burnout or if the earn & open crystal cycle was what kept me glued to it.  I haven't gotten a ""new"" champ since the Vision and also haven't ranked much because I'm anticipating all the new champs and ISO potentially any day now.

I've been getting a champ in each arena so I'm not burnt out but it is weird having not popped a crystal in a month.

ContestOfChampions,3bu18o,SKxB,1 point,Thu Jul 2 04:42:00 2015 UTC,I'm at 715k at the moment.
ContestOfChampions,3bu18o,SKxB,1 point,Thu Jul 2 05:06:18 2015 UTC,"Well I'm at 900 k at the moment, aiming to finish at 1 million so you can probably make it as well. You might need to spend a few units though."
ContestOfChampions,3bu18o,SKxB,1 point,Thu Jul 2 05:56:26 2015 UTC,"Decided to spend a few units. Ended up at Rank 47 with 1,003,292."
ContestOfChampions,3bu18o,Dracarysssss,1 point,Thu Jul 2 18:48:35 2015 UTC,"Nice man, you did it. I decided to spend some units to just in case and ranked top 50 as well."
ContestOfChampions,3bu18o,SKxB,1 point,Fri Jul 3 00:45:56 2015 UTC,Congrats! It was my last arena in the noob bracket so it felt good to grab a 4* on my way out.
ContestOfChampions,3bu18o,Dracarysssss,1 point,Fri Jul 3 02:45:39 2015 UTC,"Cool man, that's great. I'm going to move to the intermediate bracket soon as well so I'm competing in as many of the 4 star arenas as I can before I get moved."
ContestOfChampions,3bu18o,SKxB,1 point,Fri Jul 3 03:23:54 2015 UTC,"I see. For the 4*, you might grind up to the 1m milestone. I got 4-star Magneto with 1.05m score."
ContestOfChampions,3bu18o,Dracarysssss,0,Thu Jul 2 04:51:38 2015 UTC,How many points are u on at the moment? Or are you not doing this arena
ContestOfChampions,3bu18o,SKxB,1 point,Thu Jul 2 05:59:11 2015 UTC,"I'm doing the arena, but not aiming for the 4-star. I'm at intermediate bracket now. I already have 3* SW (duped) so now I'm only aiming for the 3* crystal to increase my arsenal. I have 847k points at the moment. In case you're wondering, I guess about 1.5m is the cut off for the 4* in the intermediate bracket."
ContestOfChampions,3bu18o,TheRandyRobot,1 point,Thu Jul 2 06:43:44 2015 UTC,"Bro I'm sorry to tell you this, but the cutoff for the intermediate is usually 2 million to 2.5 million"

ContestOfChampions,3btrxg,SKxB,1 point,Thu Jul 2 05:57:58 2015 UTC,"Nah... Magneto was a brand new drop, Scarlett Witch has been in the game for months, most everyone has her already.   I'm at 400k in the 3* vet bracket, hopefully that's enough."

ContestOfChampions,3bsg4r,Unknown_Form,3,Wed Jul 1 19:50:24 2015 UTC,"It is very simple: your champs PI depends on how many games (streak) you should play. Strong (higher PI) team gives more point, so less games (streaks) should be played to win. For example, i had 10 teams with R2L1 and to win i played about 200 times (streaks). Now, my 10 teams almost maxed out and now i need to play only 100-110 times to win."
ContestOfChampions,3bsg4r,x3rr_le_morge,1 point,Wed Jul 1 20:00:57 2015 UTC,Wow didn't know that.  So I should max out? I heard that max heroes don't get as many points and those points are hard to get due to the AI.
ContestOfChampions,3bsg4r,_Sham_,3,Wed Jul 1 20:03:44 2015 UTC,you are  1month late  lol  it isnt true any more.  Now it is more PI more points.  I guess you should start reading messages that you receive from Kabam in game

ContestOfChampions,3bsg4r,eamesa,3,Thu Jul 2 00:18:52 2015 UTC,"People have said at 15 it starts but I've had it start at as low as 10 with me a few times. With the ""God-mode"" streak opponents, their PI will always be lower then the champs you are using, unless you use rank 1 champs. Although I've used a few 1/10 champs and still got the low PI high AI champs and won all those fights."
ContestOfChampions,3bsg4r,alSeen,3,Thu Jul 2 16:05:03 2015 UTC,"The 2/20 was the appropriate level to level champs out until Kabam made a change back during the Abomination Arena.    I've been playing for months now, and I'm going back and maxing out all my 2*.  I would recommend you to do the same."
ContestOfChampions,3bsg4r,avicari2,1 point,Wed Jul 1 20:13:44 2015 UTC,Doing it now. Thanks.
ContestOfChampions,3bsg4r,Afiq3688,1 point,Wed Jul 1 20:20:23 2015 UTC,"I have 8 teams that go from 3/30 to 1/1. I have 3 full teams with rank 3 champs, 1 with 2/20, and the rest are rank 1. I won Magneto and Scarlet Witch and a couple of PHCs in three weeks since I started. . When I got Magneto I had 5 teams and my best was a 3/2 Wolverine, around 350pi. To get Magneto I played 140 rounds (420 fights) in the newbie bracket, got me to 402K. . For the Scarle Witch dupe arena, I have currently played 115 rounds and have 391K, max streak of 26. My advice is to have as many rank 3 heroes as possible instead of maxing out a few. Eventually you can get them all to a level where you can keep your win streaks and play less in the arena to get the rank."
ContestOfChampions,3bsg4r,chrisbroncos76,1 point,Wed Jul 1 23:09:40 2015 UTC,"You should not keep them at 2/20.  Make them at least 3/1, with a team or two maxed out at 3/30.  After you get past a 15 round win streak, the AI becomes much harder and you need the L3 attack to win."

Also, not sure how long you've been playing, or how many arena crystals you open at a time, but ive been playing since Dec, & just got a 3 punisher last week. i opened 20 arena crystals at once, 10 at a time, & really needed gold for my 4 3* champs taht are 3/30, & was surprised they gave me a 3* punisher. i think its the whole boiling pot saying, stop waiting for it, & you'll get it soon enough. 4* heros on the other hand, good luck. ha"

ContestOfChampions,3boxd6,SoggyFrenchFry,1 point,Wed Jul 1 17:10:33 2015 UTC,100k gold isn't that much to be honest. But I've opened hundreds of arena crystals and not gotten a single punisher so I'm either really unlucky or the drop rate is extremely low.
ContestOfChampions,3boxd6,JDsInnerMonologue,2,Thu Jul 2 15:06:09 2015 UTC,"Oh, okay, so this is a common thing. I remember this guy saying he keeps his 1*'s because he uses them in 1v1 battles and gets punishers once in a while, so I figured the drop rate was a little higher. But I guess not.  I'd call 100k high only because I'm fairly new to this game, and most people I play with are around 30-40k at my level.  What's the point of gold in the game anyway? It doesn't get you anything by itself."

ContestOfChampions,3boxd6,evrybodybcool,1 point,Tue Jun 30 23:59:13 2015 UTC,That's how I got both a 2* and 3* punisher. Duped my 3* twice with crystals bought with battle chips. It happens. But I know of other unlucky people too. Just keep at it.
ContestOfChampions,3boxd6,chrisbroncos76,1 point,Wed Jul 1 20:54:19 2015 UTC,It takes a lot of gold to rank champions up and also the 5v5 arenas cost a shitton of gold. Really it is just another resource that Kabam introduced to the game in the hopes that some people will pay money to get more.

ContestOfChampions,3bqdnu,adyslexic,3,Wed Jul 1 08:27:37 2015 UTC,Thor. He stuns and his specials do insane damage. I'd pick Miss marvel 2nd over Gamora just because bleed is useless against the only difficult character to beat unstoppable colossus
ContestOfChampions,3bqdnu,BAzzyBaby,1 point,Wed Jul 1 12:40:18 2015 UTC,"We talking duped or unduped? Because duped Gamora is one of the best in the game, hands down. Thor is good, but not Assassination good. He is VERY tier attack reliant."
ContestOfChampions,3bqdnu,ChillFactory,1 point,Thu Jul 2 17:59:19 2015 UTC,"Assassination does nothing against colossus though. Thor's L3 will beat anyone. 2x stun, Huge damage, and armor break"
ContestOfChampions,3bqdnu,BAzzyBaby,1 point,Mon Jul 6 12:24:15 2015 UTC,"Assassination still procs against colossus, only the bleed does not. Thor's L3 is undeniably good when duped, but as I said above, it is reliant on getting to that tier 3 attack. Against higher level opponents this becomes much more difficult and means he has one shot to make it happen. Which also brings up the point that the armor break is not guaranteed since the stun is not guaranteed (its 90%, which is frustrating when that 10% happens)."
ContestOfChampions,3bqdnu,ChillFactory,1 point,Mon Jul 6 16:25:52 2015 UTC,"Ya I'd say it's miserable using either but I can actually beat UC with Thor. Using gamora is usually a depressing fight. Both are top fighters in the game for me but i'd say the only people that are hard to beat when less than double your AI are Storm, Thor,Hulk, and UC. So anyone who can beat those 4 gets a bump in my line of thinking."

I'll stand by Thors L2 being the best in the game besides those with power burn (shout out to visions). Armor break, MASSIVE damage, and a stun that can get you back to an L1. Insane.  Gamora has to be duped to be up there, but assassination has eaten brutaldlx's star lord for breakfast.   SIDENOTE: Brutal ' s new top champ is a completely maxed electro over 5,000 pi.

ContestOfChampions,3bqd2x,otigaF,1 point,Thu Jul 2 11:56:30 2015 UTC,"I have Enhanced Fury maxed out for damage and Extended Fury maxed out as well. This means there is a five second overlap between DR Strange's Fury and his Life-Steal resulting in a quick punch that would normally heal 150 points heals 350 while damaging the other guy the same.  Basically guys like Draxx, Hulk, or Winter Soldier will benefit a lot from expanded fury masteries."

ContestOfChampions,3bpot7,lvillani81,3,Wed Jul 1 11:07:01 2015 UTC,Assuming he meant The Vision and not The Ultron.
ContestOfChampions,3bpot7,Dracarysssss,2,Wed Jul 1 12:14:17 2015 UTC,I meant The Vision. Sorry. lol I didn't notice that.
ContestOfChampions,3bpot7,lvillani81,1 point,Wed Jul 1 12:28:50 2015 UTC,You meant Ultron?  So do you have a 2* Ultron?
ContestOfChampions,3bpot7,Dracarysssss,1 point,Wed Jul 1 19:52:51 2015 UTC,"F~ck. I did it again. I meant The Vision. I don't have a 2* Ultron, rather a 2* The Vision. Sorry. I need to sleep. This arena is killing my brain."

Expect 1.6Million or more and dont be suprised if wven that's not enough. With such a limited prizepool (50 only), all it takes is for 10 more people out of millions to decide to try and the cutoff will jump right up"
ContestOfChampions,3bojbl,anthonyberkers,1 point,Tue Jun 30 21:45:36 2015 UTC,Cutoff has been over 2m ever since that first one. It's rough and honestly not worth the effort imo.
ContestOfChampions,3bojbl,mumurai,1 point,Tue Jun 30 21:58:55 2015 UTC,you just said that i don`t even have a chance ;)
ContestOfChampions,3bojbl,arfcom,1 point,Tue Jun 30 22:19:58 2015 UTC,I have come across 4 alphas so far and am not part of some crazy alliance.  Would not go at this arena.
ContestOfChampions,3bojbl,ferventlyobjective,1 point,Tue Jun 30 22:31:53 2015 UTC,Any ideas on the cutoff for the intermediate bracket?
