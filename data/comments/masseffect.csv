masseffect,3e2sl9,toxictaliban111,71,Tue Jul 21 14:55:27 2015 UTC,The answer to this is pretty simple. They're not giving you everything. Sure if the entire Turian military was committed then they'd be a lot stronger than the Alliance... but they're not doing that. They need their own forces to protect their holdings as well. The Alliance is the only one committing their forces in their entirety. The other races are not. Pretty simple.
masseffect,3e2sl9,ColonelUber,17,Tue Jul 21 16:33:19 2015 UTC,"Not to mention the Turians actually stayed to protect Palaven. After the Reapers hit earth, Hackett sacrificed an entire fleet to cover the rest of the military's retreat. All that's left on earth is guerrilla forces like the one Anderson is leading."
masseffect,3e2sl9,BorisJonson1593,19,Tue Jul 21 18:09:23 2015 UTC,"What I always assumed is that the assests given to you are of the forces that will be deployed to earth or are currently helping. Not every Turian will be at earth, nor every Quarian, Salarian, Krogan, and Geth. However, just about every human in the galaxy capable of holding a gun will be at earth. Idk for sure though."
masseffect,3e2sl9,DrewOfStateFarm,5,Tue Jul 21 16:34:29 2015 UTC,"I imagine the disparity between Alliance and Turian forces to be this:  When Earth was attacked by the reapers, Admiral Hackett sacrificed the Second Fleet and allowed the Third and Fifth to escape. He recognized that there was no point to fighting the Reapers on Earth, better to retreat and build their numbers, hitting the Reapers where they were weakest and avoiding an all-out engagement. The Turians, by comparison, decided to stay at Palaven and fight the Reapers despite taking massive losses before the Krogan joined them. I imagine that engaging in a protracted war with the Reapers would hurt even the Turian military's numbers and ability to assist with the Alliance war effort. Anyway, the difference is that Hackett got the fleets he could away from Earth ASAP, and there were a few other fleets not at Earth at the time.  You do have a serious point about Salarian military assets being pretty low, though."
masseffect,3e2sl9,Turbo2x,4,Tue Jul 21 16:30:52 2015 UTC,"That's kinda the thing about the council races. The council had a clear cut set of defining characteristics in ME1. Turians were the military and security strength of the region. The Salarians were the scientific and intelligence role, and the Asari were the biotic and diplomatic leaders. Think of it just like in real life standards.  Japan, Germany, and the US are allies. Think of the council like this alliance. The US would be the Turians here. We spend an astronomical amount of resources in our military. We spend more on military forces in Japan than Japan does themselves. Germany wasn't even allowed to legally have a military after WWII, and the US assumed the role of their military. Think of Japan as the Salarians. Why should they spend millions- perhaps billions- of dollars developing a military to replace a role their ally is assuming for them? The council races relied on themselves and each other. That was the problem with ME1's story. The council wouldn't do shit to help humans, a non-council race. This is also a problem with ME3.  In ME3, the reapers finally invade. The Turians were having a hard enough time defending their own planet with the majority of their own fleet, the biggest fleet in the galaxy. Why would they want to split their forces to help their allies when their allies are literally useless to them? That'd only put their own planet in jeopardy.   The Batarians lost their home already (thanks Shepard). They don't have much to defend. They also left council space when the council refused to declare an area of human expansion ""an area of Batarian interest"". They retreated into non-council territory and started arming raiders to strike at human colonies (the Skyllian blitz and Elyssium). At that point, the Batarians had no ruling council to interfere OR defend their territory. They got their own army going. They can't rely on the Turians anymore. It makes sense they'd have resources. Especially since Batarians are more likely to be mercs than Salarians. They're a warrior race.  Aria is a badass. She lives on a freaking asteroid in an aggressive sector of space. She's the biggest, baddest space thug in the universe. Rule #1 of Omega? Don't fuck with Aria. She had been controlling Omega for longer than any human can recall. If she tells the Blue Sons, Blood Pack, and Eclipse to band together or she'll run them off Omega, they'll do it. Banding together 3 of the largest bands of mercs in the sector is a considerable war asset. I can't think of a better front line than soldiers with the regenerative abilities of Krogan and Vorcha, and shock troops like Varren.   The Quarians and Geth just took a huge hit in a war going at each other. Not to mention most of the Migrant Fleet are civilian and support ships just to make living in space plausible. The military ships they DO have are relics. They don't have a planet to create dreadnoughts on. They're repurposed, rundown, converted ships that other races deemed too obsolete to keep. The ones not destroyed on the assault of their homeworld can't be of much help. But damn if Quarians don't know their tech. Skilled engineers for the Crucible project are where they're most needed. Sending a couple thousand tech savvy Quarians to create a device of unknown design, almost as large as the citadel itself, is a nice benefit, but wouldn't propel the effort by any significant means. I guess we can throw the Geth in the same boat as the Quarians. War ravaged, tech experts, blah blha blah.  Hanar, Drell, Volus, Elcor are all non-council races. Theres a reason for that. They've been around for thousands of years and are still minor races. Humans come into the picture and become a council race within 100 years. Why? Because those races suck. They're just pretty much there. Leeching on the council and other races. Not great innovators, not great in terms of strength. No biotic potential. I'm surprised the Reapers didn't send 1 Reaper to each of their homeworlds to conqueror it in a matter of days.   Finally, the Alliance. Yeah, they're providing a majority of the resources to the operation. That's because they're defending their homeworld. Just like everyone. The Turians won't send all their ships to aid a human world when their own world is being ravaged. They have no idea if the Crucible will even work. Why should they sacrifice all of Palavin in a gambit to defend the Human's homeworld? That race hasn't even been a council race for more than 5 years! They're the new kid on the block! Fuck em'! However, they still send what little support they can. If there's one thing Shepard can do, it's inspire hope."

The idea that people have to come to Reddit for this kind of information, when it should be clearly listed somewhere.  As to the issue of product keys, I've always found Origin to be a little more open to this kind of thing. I've registered old retail codes of some games with it, also stuff from other platforms like D2D & Steam.  Anytime it lets you it's a good idea, because it just creates redundant access to all your games in case any of these system ever go away."

I died, came back to the hub station, and saw that all the AI set scores were at 4 or 5 minutes.  My first reaction was like ""oops, I guess that's one way to show up the crowd.""  And my second reaction was to wonder if they were going to do that thing they did in Knights of the Old Republic, where an AI would beat you, regardless of your time.  The last mission where you do it ""for real"" was entertaining though, and you got decent rewards out of it."

The survival missions, if you're high level and geared up are far too easy in my experience. I could have gone on for hours, got bored by 11 minutes. Rest isn't too bad, the final fight is actually quite a lot easier than it is hyped up to be providing you sit right by the door.  I still complete it on each playthrough, but I usually stick it on the lowest difficulty just so it's over quickly."

The second I surpass the top time I just crank the difficulty up and stand there for a few minutes while enemies slowly kill me.  I did like the apartment and the easy access to good gear though. I just wish Pinnacle Station was referenced more in the rest of the trilogy. There was cut content in ME2 for one of the Galactic News things where Shepard's apartment was given to an orphanage or something. Otherwise, you can see Pinnacle Station in ME3 and I think you get war assets from it."

masseffect,3e2fjj,captainconway,8,Tue Jul 21 17:51:21 2015 UTC,"Keep it simple. Male Shepards that look okay are hard to make.   1-  If you're using a face code, just start a game, select a custom character and do the following:   In ME3 write the facecode on the box at the bottom left of the screen. Enter. Done In ME2 you must use the sliders to get to the code, since i don't think you can just write it down. Just keep using the sliders until the facecode matches the numbers. It will appear above his head. Ithas a logic - the sliders begin at 'A' or '1' and keep going forward. To do it in ME1, use a sliders tool (someone already posted the link in this thread)   2- To try it on your own, I advise this:  Make his face as narrow as you can so he won't look bloated,and with as few angles as possible on the cheeks - the gaunt slider is a bitch. You don't want him to be a victim of ""used as punching bag by a krogan"" syndrome.   Keep his neck on medium/narrow, or you'll get someone that looks like he's on steroids.   Extreme colors on eyes or hair will be a no-no if you want someone who looks realistic.   If you're playing ME3 the textures will always get you too much detail and your Shep will usually look a little bit odd, no matter what you do. Certain areas, especially the Normandy are flattering, while very bright areas will f-up the contrasts and will call up demons to take hold of his face.  In ME1 and 2 he usually looks softer, which can be less of a shock.   I consider my Sheps to be good-looking fellas, and their faces are pretty simple. I have my ebony god, my silver-haired veteran and my regular white guy, whose hair is modded in ME3 but who looks fine without it too. (I'm keeping the hair for Tali. Don't judge me).  The webpage 'Faces of Gaming' always has more than enough Shepards to share, and many aren't modded, which is crucial.

But I've based both of them off of other people/characters, so I always had a reference to make sure everything was in correct proportion and whatnot. That certainly helps a lot.  That said, right as I was starting ME2 I decided that I wanted to tweak my current Shepherd's appearance a bit, failing to realize that when I selected the custom option it would default back to the template Shepherd, so I had to try to reconstruct her face from scratch. Then when I started the game, I realized I never bothered to check her profile before starting, and THAT was a horrific surprise.   So tip #1 - find a person or character close to what you want to make, and keep an image handy for reference when you're making your Shepherd. Tip #2 - check your Shepherd's profile before exiting the editor!"

masseffect,3e2fjj,NWCtim,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:37:13 2015 UTC,"On PC I believe you right click and drag around to make Shepherd's head move and check the profile that way. Imagine on console it would be one of the joysticks or holding a button while moving a joystick, but honestly have no idea."
masseffect,3e2fjj,MarshallMelon,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:10:00 2015 UTC,It's the sticks. Personally I've felt it's little help though. I wish there had been away to rotate the whole character instead of just making him look around.
masseffect,3e2fjj,backstept,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:39:34 2015 UTC,"This might be obvious, but you can turn his head during the character create so you can a better idea of how he'll look in game."

masseffect,3e2hlo,IkLms,6,Tue Jul 21 13:55:47 2015 UTC,I think I tried Infiltrator and gave it up. That's mostly because I am not a fan of any shooting game on mobile. The controls always completely suck.
masseffect,3e2hlo,Darklyte,4,Tue Jul 21 14:46:57 2015 UTC,completely agree. I had a really hard time with the controls and they just didn't feel natural at all.  Plus it doesn't help that it doesn't allow you to play on a rooted device.
masseffect,3e2hlo,IkLms,2,Tue Jul 21 15:04:53 2015 UTC,Yeah. The rooted device killed me before I last upgraded and didn't bother rooting.   Too many games and apps pull that BS.

masseffect,3e2thx,Pattonesque,2,Tue Jul 21 17:27:50 2015 UTC,"I like all the main-story DLC but it may depend on what type of extras you're after. Leviathan is big on exploring and lore background. Citadel is fun, includes a party and you get to meet/hang out with squadmates. From Ashes is relatively short but gives you an amazing character. Omega is longer and completely self-contained. Most of it takes place on Omega and has Shepard working solo or with Aria. There are new characters, new powers and new enemies. Some people find it too long or slow, but I think no more so than other parts of the main game. If you can afford it and want to spend the money, I definitely recommend it. You could always leave it for another playthrough instead; I like coming back to the trilogy knowing there's a completely new story to explore."
masseffect,3e2thx,ADG12311990,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:41:38 2015 UTC,"I like all that stuff. In fact, the less time spent in burning endgame levels, where everyone is dead or dying and all travel points are closed, and the more I get to do small-time detective stories and hunting quests, the happier I am. I always enjoy RPG games most around the 40-60% segment, when you have many unlocks left, and your weapons and armor aren't overpowered.  The only things I don't like in Mass Effect are protection time trials (""cover me while I hack this console!"") and attack waves. Kai Leng was okay, only died three times on Insanity (goddamn Phantoms), but fighting all those Banshees in London, even though I hauled ass when the next stage was ready, was just stressful.  I may have to do all the DLC in one playthrough, though, otherwise my brain will be ""Mass Effect""-fatigued by this time next week.  Shit, I still have two bought-but-unplayed DLC in ME1, and one in ME2. Kasumi and Shadowbroker I finished, but there were two more, I think."

On top of that, the community at /r/MECoOp is friendly, helpful, and pretty tight, and I've even met other people who also got into MP ""by accident.""  I'm also looking at starting this idea I have for a self-imposed MP ""campaign"" to add some extra flavor to teams who want to do some light roleplay -- will probably put up a post there about it soon."

masseffect,3dzi0q,meshaber,10,Tue Jul 21 12:57:59 2015 UTC,"Oh, hello there Shepard. Fancy a story while you're down here? You might learn something.  As a mercenary, you see the universe in a different way to most people. You go from planet to planet, colony to colony, murdering every goddamn person you meet. You start to see them less as people and more as fun little blood-filled targets who can't seem to aim their guns right.  So when I was taking some time off on Illium one fine month two years back, I suppose it's no surprise that I had no trouble finding a way to kill a few so-called people. See, I always loved the slums of Illium, down below the clouds in all the smog and shit of the actual land. While the Asari up top sell their blue asses to ignorant children and get them hooked on the red shit, I'm down in the slums getting the real crazy pussy.  Anyway, back on track, right? One night in a charming little brothel called The Asure Slat I buy this enormous bloody Matriarch whore for a bit of the old thermal release, you know? Sometime around fifteen minutes into the craziest sex I've ever had, I realize that this Matriarch is in fact a Krogan Battlemaster with blue paint on his face. Color me shocked.  Now, I was disgusted of course. But when I get started I have to finish. Pounding away even more furiously than I had been before, I finally reach climax, pulling out and relieving myself all over the Krogan's back. It was right then that the bastard pulled a gun from between his legs and tried to blow my head off. He didn't know I'd caught on to his act five minutes before the moneyshot.  By the time he'd spun around to put one between my eyes, I'd already slipped a Hanar sex toy under his goddamn crest. Wrenching upward with all my strength, that bit of crocodile skin popped off like a goddamn spent thermal clip. Ramming my fist into his exposed skull, I yanked out his tiny walnut brain and smashed it right in front of his dying eyes.  It was then that I realized the Krogan was actually fifteen Asari schoolgirls on a field trip to the local greenhouse, and that I'd mowed them all down to get off.  ...Red Sand is a hell of a drug, Shepard."

I feel like players could have been led to sympathize with her for being damaged by no fault of her own, addicted to something that hurts her and the people around her and persecuted by a cold, calculating personification of authority. Maybe the plan was to put her on the Normandy to reveal that Ardat Yakshi can live without being killers and without being sequestered if they lead an exciting enough life and don't bone anyone.

Make sure you get the Enhanced Edition and install the Rise of the White Wolf mod (improves the UI and graphics) if you do play it.  Well, you can only play the third game on PS4, so if you want to play all the games on the same platform and import your save games you should play the games on PC.

I play very aggressively though, so I'm focus fired more or less constantly; most of the time my squad can do whatever they want without the enemy paying attention to them."
masseffect,3e109a,OH_ITS_MEGACRUNCH,15,Tue Jul 21 03:09:47 2015 UTC,"Personally, they both fit their atmospheres well.  ME2 has this sunset-y feel to it. Which fits the game because realistically, the tone of the story is gloomy and feels like everything's ending at a bittersweet climax. Which fits the sunset color scheme well. The ME2 title screen shows this very well.  The ME3 colorscheme was dark, mixed with lots of lens flare. This gives the feeling of dread because of the Reapers but also shows the mum-get-the-camera-MLG Michael Bay battles going on everywhere. It's actually nice when they pull off making the game look like dark and flashy at the same time.  Different atmospheres, different color schemes. I think both fits each game well."
masseffect,3e109a,NebulaGray88,6,Tue Jul 21 03:29:41 2015 UTC,"I agree. ME2's color scheme made everything feel sort of cyberpunk, while ME3's made it feel like the apocalypse."
masseffect,3e109a,Slothman27,3,Tue Jul 21 07:05:42 2015 UTC,ME2 is a bit noirish... but the lighting is horrid for darker skin tones and overhead lighting is horrible in general. I notice the tone is used to hide the lower quality pixelated textures in the environment.  ME3 got post-processing vignette which I didn't like but at higher res they're pretty good.
masseffect,3e109a,aoibhealfae,4,Tue Jul 21 07:16:03 2015 UTC,"There's things I like better from both games, but I definitely prefer the way the characters look in ME2 compared to ME3 for pretty much everyone but Kaidan.

masseffect,3e109a,imuahmanila,4,Tue Jul 21 09:09:27 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I agree. Like you said, I don't think ME3's graphics are bad at all, but in ME2 the graphics just look really sharp and nice. In fact I think ME2's graphics may be a bit better."
masseffect,3e109a,VaN7uard,4,Tue Jul 21 03:29:42 2015 UTC,Me3 really fucked up with the face modeling and textures textures for Ashley and FemShep. They just look kinda plastic-y.

masseffect,3e109a,cymikelee,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:54:27 2015 UTC,"I kind of agree with what's been said already about each game fitting its atmosphere, but I have to say I preferred the way the weapons felt in ME2 -- those streaks (tracers?) coming out really gave the a more sci-fi-y feel, and the sounds were just great.  None of the guns really had a weak feel to them, until you paid closer attention to the damage you were dealing with each."
masseffect,3e109a,cristi1990an,2,Tue Jul 21 07:46:08 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I imagine it had to do with how combat has been made a lot more mobile now, but weapons just don't seem to have the same punch in 3. I also miss 2's health bar, seeing precisely how much damage I did rather than a flashing segment was far more satisfying."
masseffect,3e109a,someguyN7,1 point,Tue Jul 21 07:57:19 2015 UTC,"Totally agree. Mass Effect 2 had a better art style and even the graphical quality was FAR more consistent too. In ME3, the environments quality fluctuated between being horrible and very good."
masseffect,3e109a,ss33094,3,Tue Jul 21 13:45:26 2015 UTC,I enjoyed ME1's color scheme best out of all three installments. I love the atmosphere it builds by using blues as the main pallet and having hints of orange to liven up things.
masseffect,3e109a,MyLittleSconey,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:34:26 2015 UTC,"I also liked ME2's animations a bit better. Mainly the running animation when you have your weapon up. NOT the sprinting animation, just the default running animation. It's such a small thing but idk, like in ME2 your steps were closer togethers and made you feel fast, and really gave you this feeling that you were storming an area. ME1 was the same way. ME3 though the running animation is just slower and never felt quite right to me. Very small thing, but I always seem to notice it more than I probably should lol."

However, if you completely ignore things that have been officially confirmed two and three times, I can't imagine why anyone would be interested in your speculation.  I find it difficult to believe that members of Bioware's staff are engaged it a complicated disinformation campaign.

Even if I knew I'd have to kill Wrex if I don't reverse the geno phage, I wouldn't have changed my decision though. Saving the galaxy from the rule of the aggressive power hungry krogans (if reapers are defeated)  is worth any 1 life, including my own.

Also, I commend you for making decisions that you felt were right to you, rather than just picking options ""Because they're Paragon"", it sounds like you tried to logically and pragmatically pick what you think are the best options for the galaxy.  And even if they backfired, you didn't reload and accepted your decisions, so I commend you for that also!  On a side note, I can understand your logic for most choices (even if I don't agree with all of them), but choosing Morinth over Samara? Ouch.  Ancient, wise and powerful Asari justicar versus a psychotic homicidal maniac.  Even my Renegade Shep could never pick Morinth over Samara.

Fact is I was preparing for a suicide mission and a large battle in the war against and insurmountable enemy. I need things dead, so whether I am enlisting a super assassin like thane, or a homicidal maniac, it's all good since I need a lot of things to die.

It's been years, and I may have a slightly too rosey memory of it, but that game is pure magic in my world. I played it before the original and was horribly disappointed by it when I got back to it."

masseffect,3e07s3,meshaber,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:42:02 2015 UTC,"KotoR 2 was a rushed mess, to the point of arguably not even being a completed game. It suffered from a ton of bugs, and had enormous amounts of content cut. The restored content mod dug up a lot of the cut material and put it back in the game. It was a huge project for a mod, but it worked well. I think it even had the endorsement of a few of the developers.  I think the game is fantastic even without it, but no reason not to use it."

masseffect,3e07s3,dodgysmalls,5,Tue Jul 21 00:21:25 2015 UTC,"TW3 is a completely different mode of storytelling (you play as a distinct character, not roleplay as whatever you want) but is easily one of the better open world games I've ever played, and still retains some nice dialogue options. Despite the open world, the story is a lot more focused. Open world games also generally suffer from shallow combat mechanics, but TW3 has pretty good combat. Not as strong as something like DarkSouls, but solid.  Also it's based on novels which won't disappoint you the way most videogame novels would, since the novels came before and not after. Although I will never forgive Andrzej for what he did Cahir, Milva, or Angouleme."
masseffect,3e07s3,EvitGrey,2,Tue Jul 21 02:43:46 2015 UTC,Is the Witcher 1 and 2 comparable in story telling as well? I heard there is save importing like in dragon age and mass effect so I wanted to play through from 1.
masseffect,3e07s3,dodgysmalls,3,Tue Jul 21 02:46:35 2015 UTC,"TW1&2 + Save Import:  Save importing is a feature, but there's little to no payoff for choices which carry over, occasional throwaway dialogue for the most part. Also several of the popular characters from TW2 don't carry even show up in TW3, even if you use save import after interacting with them heavily.  Additionally, there's a feature which allows you to recreate most of the significant decisions through a conversation with another NPC.  On the whole the save import feature is pretty underwhelming and ultimately of little value, and that's coming from someone who thinks save import is one of the most vital things about Mass Effect's narrative. Mostly because I really detest the gameplay of the first two games, I'd even prefer ME1's gameplay over theirs.     Is the Witcher 1 and 2 comparable in story telling as well?   This question is extremely difficult to answer.   The games all have dialogue choices and decisions, but they behave differently than in BioWare games. It mostly centers around the idea that the protagonist (Geralt) is a distinct character, so it's less about role playing and more like an interactive story. The choices are still satisfying though.  The first two games are also structured around big divergent points, where you can take two different paths, whereas TW3 is more linear.  However the narrative of the first two games is sort of like ME2 is to the mass effect series, very unimportant. You can skip to TW3 without missing much at all, especially if you spend 5 minutes reading a primer.  The story of TW3 is excellent, it mislabels some of the relationships WRT the novels, but it actually patches a massive hole in Andrzej's writing. One of my favourite things is how it compliments the novels.  It's also a lot more mature/serious, despite some of the female costumes being a bit ridiculous.    TL;DR if you don't mind awkward pacing and gameplay the second game is somewhat worth playing, I don't recommend the first at all."
masseffect,3e07s3,EvitGrey,2,Tue Jul 21 03:47:52 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the detailed reply. The save import doing very little is pretty disappointing. I guess I'm just spoiled by mass effect. I, like op, have been having trouble finding a game as satisfying as bioware's. I'll try out the first two witchers for the story but if anything I'll just jump to TW3 like you said. Hopefully TW3 lives up to the hype. Thanks again!"

masseffect,3e07s3,johnrocket-son,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:23:40 2015 UTC,"As said before, KotoR and KotoR II are great games worth your attention. Same developer (Bioware) as Mass Effect and Dragon Age but Star Wars! They have awesome story and characters and choices with consequences and romances and all the good stuff from ME and DA.  Jade Empire is another older Bioware game that was great. Again all the good stuff Bioware does with such a good story and better combat than KotoR.  The Witcher games are great and have a really great thematic feel but I never felt as connected as with Bioware games.  Skyrim (all the elder scrolls really), Fallout 3, and Borderlands are really really great games that you might enjoy but they traded the emotional depth of Bioware games for more open ended, exploration-type gameplay.  Basically, IMO there are lots of great RPGs but Bioware really does an exceptional job of creating decisions and relationships that suck you into their universe, so you may not find the same experience in other games but these others are all great too."
masseffect,3e07s3,meshaber,2,Tue Jul 21 15:06:13 2015 UTC,Nothing in gaming is as difficult as going for a closed fist ending in Jade Empire. It makes my skin crawl just thinking about it.  Damn how I want a spiritual successor to that game.

masseffect,3dxx7b,MystDLOL,31,Mon Jul 20 13:09:43 2015 UTC,"I read all the bad press about the ending of ME3 and held off for the longest time. Put in 100+ hours in both 1 and 2, but I just never went for 3.  Finally a few weeks ago I bought it and started playing. Brought me right back into the universe. As cynical as I was going into it, even the ending, it still felt special and sad when it was over. Now I have the desire to play the whole thing again, and in fact I've already started a new playthrough of 1.  The one thing I'll say about the ending is, even though it's not written well and the star child is annoying, it does at least make for some interesting speculation. I can see why so many people have headcanons for the game; even if you accept everything shown in the endings as gospel truth, there's a lot of room for interpretation. Especially if you consider that the star child may not have been telling the truth.  EDIT: For those commenting, yes, I have the Extended Cut DLC. I was pretty skeptical even after it came out because a lot of people were saying it's not much better. After watching videos of the original endings, I can safely say it's at least far less bad."
masseffect,3dxx7b,itsamamaluigi,16,Mon Jul 20 14:30:36 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I enjoyed the missions in ME3 more then 2. ME2 was like 70% Recruit people, make them loyal. Actual story related missions were kinda slim. Both last play through and current are kinda ""Minimal"" runs just to explore all the Dialogue for Paragon only / Renegade only. My third play through I'll take the time to complete the side quests, and search every planet/system etc. This way I can choose all 3 endings too. Control for paragon, Destroy for Renegade and Synthesize for Mixed."
masseffect,3dxx7b,itsamamaluigi,8,Mon Jul 20 14:41:28 2015 UTC,"That's true but I actually liked that aspect of 2 because it made it a more character-driven story.

masseffect,3dxx7b,filippo333,11,Mon Jul 20 20:17:02 2015 UTC,"People whine about games a lot in this world but this one seems pretty justified. To recap, in the original version:   Same exact outcome/cutscene regardless of choice except for color of explosion, the destroyed reaper falling over, and in synthesis everyone has glowing green eyes Normandy runs from the battle with no explanation of what is happening.  Relay network destroyed, all galactic civilizations are cut off from one another Normandy crash lands on unknown planet with the ship clearly wrecked beyond repair. Survivors stagger out (even if they were on Earth during the final battle.) Cut to black.   The extended cut showed:   Normandy coming back to earth to pick up surviving squad members and allow one last goodbye. The allied fleet is ordered to flee the catalyst, with Joker waiting as long as possible to run. The relay network is damaged, not destroyed. The catalyst choice effects are shown throughout the galaxy, including cheering crowds on Thessia and Tuchanka as the reapers fall. A voice narration plays over a slideshow showing the fates of crew members and planets based in part on decisions that were made. The futures of surviving characters and civilizations are shown, or if you screwed up, their darker endings. The Normandy's crash is minor, and there is a scene showing the survivors having a memorial for the fallen, including Shepard. The Normandy is shown taking off at the end, so even though Shepard is dead, our friends in the crew at least have the chance to enjoy the reaper-free galaxy they fought for.   You can thank everybody who complained about it for giving you the more satisfying endgame experience. ;)"

And to be honest, reading and watching all the reviews about the ending and how bad it  is, I played the game when extended cut was out and I was not dismayed with it. It was pretty okay actually. Sure it wasn't perfect and picture slides suck. Sure it would be badass to see all the war assets come into play.

masseffect,3dzxn8,silentmarine,7,Mon Jul 20 21:59:11 2015 UTC,"The song tells a folk tale of a cowboy who has a vision of red-eyed, steel-hooved cattle thundering across the sky, being chased by the spirits of damned cowboys. One warns him that if he does not change his ways, he will be doomed to join them, forever ""trying to catch the Devil's herd across these endless skies"". Jones said that he had been told the story when he was 12 years old by an old cowboy friend.   I think the message in the song is why they chose it. Now this is all speculation, but those ""damned cowboys"" could be races from before and, similar to what Vigil told Shep on Ilos about the Reapers in ME1, our MEA heroes will be warned of another imminent threat. When it says ""change his ways"" it immediately got me thinking of the Dark Energy theory and how the increase use of eezo in just about everything in the Milky Way.   Perhaps they receive this warning and find that they won't be able to stop this from happening soon enough and, in effort to buy the survival of the Milky Way species' more time, the pathfinder initiative is born."
masseffect,3dzxn8,Biowhere,2,Tue Jul 21 00:15:15 2015 UTC,"Don't know much about the Dark Energy theory, but I have a feeling the ""warned of another imminent threat"" idea is well founded. I have a feeling the warning is different than what some are thinking- I feel the warning is about Andromeda itself, that others have been there before, and it is a terrible wasteland of villiany, deep esoteric horrors, powers even more horrible and formidable than the Reapers, something.   I also have a hunch it might be something along the lines of a warning against synthetics, or bad politics. The song is pretty straightforward that the fate of the damned cowboys was brought upon themselves, by their own transgressions. I feel the warning is much more about something the group we see in Andromeda will bring upon themselves."
masseffect,3dzxn8,Green-Whiskey,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:04:11 2015 UTC,Dark energy was a dropped plot line where it would turn out the Reapers reaped to prevent the destruction of the galaxy due to over use of eezo and mass effect fields. Tali's trip to Haestrum and the aging sun was the first hint at it.  But it still fits into the idea that the cowboys earned their own damnation. Just as the galaxy is destroying itself by using eezo.
masseffect,3dzxn8,KnightsFan,7,Tue Jul 21 17:26:59 2015 UTC,I never really got all the complaints about the song.  I figured Bioware just wanted to have a surprise at the E3 demo when you have nobody knowing what the hell the trailer was for and then they show the N7 logo and everyone goes nuts.

masseffect,3dzxn8,irbos,7,Tue Jul 21 12:35:49 2015 UTC,"I think you are all looking way, WAY too much into it.  The song was very clearly, as mentioned, about cowboys.  Back in the days the cowboys were talked about, in those songs, they were in the frontier.  As we all know (or believe I guess?) we are going to be in control of a character that is in a new frontier.  While there are plenty of songs that say this, the Johnny Cash song really has the feel of a frontier song."
masseffect,3dzxn8,Chiokos,2,Tue Jul 21 00:34:27 2015 UTC,Maybe they picked the only song by a popular artist that faithfully relays the plot of Andromeda. So sneak!

I've had friends who have had roses tattooed on their body and people ask them to ""explain the meaning behind it.""  My friend has an awesome tattoo of an owl on her arm, and when I asked why she got it, she said, ""Because my tattoo artist drew it and I liked it.""  And it's one of her best tattoos.

masseffect,3dvzcj,ParaTC,30,Mon Jul 20 08:25:01 2015 UTC,"I would. If I had this tattoo it'd be inevitable that people would ask me about it, wanting to know what it is. Maybe even in a job interview. And I'd have to either decide that I'm uncomfortable with sharing the story behind it, or explain to my future employer, that I am so passionate about a video game, that I tattooed it all over my forearm. Maybe it's just not for me."
masseffect,3dvzcj,Version467,20,Mon Jul 20 08:33:34 2015 UTC,"Can confirm. I have a tattoo from a tabletop rpg(not D&D) on my forearm. Everyone asks what it is and what it means. I always go to interviews in longsleeves, then inquire on their tattoo policy or stance in the meeting."
masseffect,3dvzcj,FullplateHero,5,Mon Jul 20 09:37:45 2015 UTC,"Well the long sleeves to an interview thing is just smart, because some people do have policies in place.   Pretty much everybody asks everybody what their tattoos mean unless they're immediately obvious.  It kind of comes with the territory.  If you're not comfortable talking about the piece of artwork you paid hundreds of dollars to get scratched into your arm, you probably weren't thinking too far ahead or it probably didn't mean enough to get it tattoo in the first place.

masseffect,3dvzcj,Tigerbones,3,Mon Jul 20 14:48:03 2015 UTC,"Well, believe me when I say, I doubt that any potential employer is going to care what kind of tattoo you have.  They'd be more inclined to not hire you for having them in the first place, and even that attitude is dying out rather quickly.  You would think that OP's GF would be okay sharing the story behind it considering she got it tattooed on herself (not that it requires a story. ""It's a thing from a video game I like.""  'Nuff said.).  Also, I'm not sure if you've actually ever been on a professional interview, but it's kind of unprofessional asking, ""What does your tattoo mean"" to an interviewee.  It's probably none of your business, and tattoo content doesn't have much to do with job performance."
masseffect,3dvzcj,center24tp,5,Mon Jul 20 13:40:12 2015 UTC,"Yes, I have been on professional interviews and where I come from, it's quite common that part of the interview consists of more personal questions, like hobbys etc. It could also be a casual question at the end of an interview. There's nothing unprofessional in casually asking if there's a story behind your tattoo. Especially not, if it's as big as this one, because it's obviously something very important to you, considering its size.  Also, telling him that ""it's a thing from a video game I like"" is indeed all it requires to explain this tattoo, but it also tells your employer that you are really, really passionate about video games, and that is possibly even worse then having a tattoo in the first place.  Just for the record, I am from Germany and it is possible that interviews in the US, or elsewhere are just different. If that's the case, then my point is invalid for interviews in your country."
masseffect,3dvzcj,Version467,0,Mon Jul 20 14:17:24 2015 UTC,"I can't verify that nobody would ask that in an interview in the U.S., but it would seem a bit too personal on a ""professional level"" interview, unless you're talking about teaching K-12.  Unless somebody really likes it and is complementing it, I don't think most people would ask you what your tattoo means without prefacing it with that.  It would come off as condescending.  I say this a somebody with tattoos who has given many interviews and who has never been asked about them on a professional interview.  I also don't flaunt them at an interview, because that's just silly and asking for trouble.  Do you honestly think that being passionate about video games is ""possibly even worse than having a tattoo in the first place""?  You know that video games have been out since the 70's, right?  That's almost 50 years.  It's not some weird dark corner of mainstream society full of trench coat wearing nerds or burnout losers.  Video games and the consumption of them are as mainstream as any other ""respectable"" medium.  People have tattoos about movies, books, television shows, religions, and anything else you can think of.  Again, maybe things are much different in Germany, and maybe you're coming from the perspective of an industry that is incredibly stuffy, but unless you're blowing lines off of a hooker's ass and posting it to Facebook, most companies don't really care that much how you spend your personal time outside of work.  I also find that sentiment a little ironic considering that you seem to post to subs such as /r/pcmasterrace, /r/watercooling, /r/buildapc, and of course, /r/masseffect quite often .  You're clearly very passionate about video games and have been on (and I assumed worked) many ""professional level"" jobs.  What do your employers have to say about your clear passion for video games?"
masseffect,3dvzcj,center24tp,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:25:38 2015 UTC,"I've got a mass effect tattoo on my left (inside) forearm. It is pretty large (about 4x5).

They are uncomfortable, because if you're actually working with other professionals, they can get a bit judgy. On the off hand, I don't actually care very much, but I did for a bit.

masseffect,3dvzcj,drearypilot,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:30:30 2015 UTC,"Yes, I am pretty passionate about video games, that's why we are all here, right? And it's not something that I think. I won't judge you if you have tattoos, or play video games, that would be really hypocritical, considering I spend quite a bit of time playing games myself. But being passionate about video games is really not something you should bring up in a job interview here in germany. There is still a huge stigma surrounding video games here. Playing video games is something that lazy people do and if you don't want to come off as lazy, you won't mention it. It's bullshit, but that's how it is. Btw, I work in IT."

masseffect,3e17rc,meshaber,1 point,Tue Jul 21 09:17:27 2015 UTC,Seems like a pretty arbitrary number.
masseffect,3e17rc,izmirtheastarach,2,Tue Jul 21 12:12:44 2015 UTC,"Not to mention 5 games is not a small number of games. Considering ME has been around for nearly 10 years and has only 3 games.  I mean let's say they did make 5 more games. That is probably another 15 years worth of games. If the games were any more frequent than this I would be pretty worried that they would become the next Assassin's Creed. A game with a great pedigree that chose to cash in every year.  I don't see Bioware doing this, so I don't really expect Bioware to release 5 games in such a short amount of time."
masseffect,3e17rc,IAmDarkridge,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:47:44 2015 UTC,"Yeah, seems a little crazy. Also why would we be worrying about crap that far in the future? ONLY 5 games indeed."
masseffect,3e17rc,izmirtheastarach,2,Tue Jul 21 16:28:40 2015 UTC,"The problem, in my opinion, with basing a game around the Rachni Wars, Krogan Rebellions or the Morning War is that we know how they all ended. True there's a bit of wiggle room in the details but they're all foregone conclusions. That's fine if you want the game to be based around fighting against the inevitible (like Halo Reach) but it's directly against the whole idea of Mass Effect's choice-based narrative. I'm not saying it's impossible to see a game based around those, it is EA after all, but I don't see it as being likely.  If/when they want to go back to the Milky Way and keep ME3's endings open then they're going to have to do either a prequel or a game set in an area of the galaxy so removed from everything else that the war and the Crucible just passed them by somehow. I admit that the latter would be pretty difficult to set up and would probably mean cutting out the Refusal ending.   Either way I think it more likely that they'll opt for stories on a more personal scale instead of galaxy-spanning wars and threats of an apocalyptic nature. And it'll likely be something not covered in much depth in the games or the lore. The above three are all pretty well covered, as is the First Contact War.   A game with you playing as an escaped batarian slave trying to make your way in the Terminus Systems while balancing your desire for vengence with your desire to free other slaves (or opting for one over the other) would be interesting. However whether they'd go for a proper linked trilogy like the original, with a single protagonist throughout, or if they'd take a more 'shared universe' approach like they have with Dragon Age, I don't know. I'd prefer the former for character growth and interaction but the latter is better for telling widely different stories and you're not as pinned down in choice.  Or, again it being EA, they'll stick with Andromeda for as long as it's financially viable and then either kill the franchise entirely or let it lie for a few years and reboot the whole thing from scratch."

I always save her there, such a waste of life to follow a code so blindly.  I've seen James in another light after reading the comics/watching Paragon Lost, I enjoy his character much more after knowing a bit more about his past.

The problem with James is that ME3 doesn't present very much information about his character. The only thing to distinguish him from just some other marine is a very weak attempt at creating a foil for the PC through the N7 program.  James as a character could be interesting, hell he could even be round and dynamic. But ME3 James flat, static, and basically just a vessel for a few lines of lackluster comedy. Doesn't mean you have to dislike him, but it's one of the more disappointing decisions by BioWare."

masseffect,3dz26b,meshaber,4,Mon Jul 20 19:52:19 2015 UTC,"When you qualify your argument for the adequacy of a character with ""interesting"" you can equate the best characters in fiction to the worst. On some level Hamlet is about as interesting as Vega.   He has a ton of personality, a backstory as interesting as any other squad member's   You are correct that the level of detail of his backstory is about equivalent to any other squadmember, even fan favourites like Tali or Garrus. You are also correct that there's no valid way to argue he has less or more ""personality"" than any other member of the cast, he is coherent.  Let's make a comparison. Garrus and Vega are similar in that their subplots hinge entirely around difficult decisions, they differ in that Garrus feels an intrinsic correctness in his decision making (they should have shot down heart's ship, I will kill Sidonis), which is in opposition to Vega who is completely uncertain of whether he made the correct decision. Please note that you can compare this to either ME1/2 Garrus in a vacuum (ie. offering no advantage of multiple titles to Garrus).  In ME1/2 Garrus' subplot elaborates on this theme somewhat awkwardly, but each player will craft their own arc for him through their decisions. There is a very obvious (per player divergent) arc for his character within either title. As we experience his subplots we generate our own narrative rooted in the concepts which are presented. Do the ends justify the means? An eye for an eye? There are a lot of interesting philosophical and moral concepts raised in each (ME1/2) discrete subplot. By contrast even to this minimal character building, Vega has no arc. Even his dialogue in the final farewell sequence can do nothing but harken back to his profession.   a unique relationship with Shepard (because N-program)   A laughable attempt at creating a foil. A foil has a huge amount of utility, generally their goal is to offer the audience commentary on a protagonist or otherwise central character.  Another comparison, and a more depressing one. Traynor is a sub character, not even a companion. By observing Traynor's character over the course of the game we see a young woman rise to the occasion and help, in the best way she can, to stop the reapers. In a sense Traynor undergoes a heroes journey. This character to some degree offers us insight on every companion we've ever had in the series, and reminds us that not only characters which can accompany us into combat are of significance.  By contrast I see no value in Vega's relationship with Shepard, it doesn't offer us a unique viewpoint on the difficult decisions we've had to make, it doesn't offer us insight into the galaxy's perception of our character.    Again I'd like to be clear that I totally understand why you might find Vega a likeable character/companion, and there's nothing wrong with that. I think it's pretty trivial to argue that he's one of the more pointless and low value characters in ME3. I also completely disagree about the 'uniqueness' you present, his relationship with Shepard, and therefore the player, has only two unique aspects (the ones you listed) whereas most other squadmates have more than 5, and Garrus has already offered us commentary on both of those ideas, albeit in a slightly different manner.  In summary I'd like to point out how much of Vega's character is summed up by the statement ""he's a soldier."" It's impossible to get any idea who Tali/Garrus/Thane/Legion are from such a simple statement. And I don't mean that he fits the stereotype. I mean that pretty much everything about Vega is derivative from his profession.  /novel"

Seeing Shepard in a mentor's position is something we haven't really done before (I think giving Garrus morality lectures is quite a different animal). I think the best parts of Vega's character come from the scene in purgatory where he asks you to buy the other soldiers a drink. That scene is a unique presentation of Shepard's character from both the perspective of an average soldier (something we haven't really seen before) and from Vega, who has about as much in common with Shepard as with them. It's his role as the not-quite average guy who is way out of his depth that offers something unique.  I think it's about as simple to summarize Tali with ""She's a quarian"" actually. She started out as a token quarian/exposition on legs, and then she's just had two additional games of character development, but she never ventured far outside of ""token quarian"".  I don't have particularly strong feelings about Vega myself by the way, I think he's right in the middle of character writing for the series. I didn't say he was somehow more unique than anyone else, just that he offers something that other characters don't."
masseffect,3dz26b,meshaber,2,Mon Jul 20 21:31:33 2015 UTC,"but you were actually the one to bring up that he could have been interesting   ""He has a ton of personality, a backstory as interesting as any other squad member's (Well, discounting Javik)""  My argument was certainly poorly worded, but I don't like when people argue a character is good or bad because they are ""interesting"" it's a generic term often used to refer to a character which added value to you in a way you are not able to specifically describe, which is how I interpreted your post.   Sincerely: I will not make an elcor Hamlet joke.   Nice.   I think it's about as simple to summarize Tali with ""She's a quarian"" actually.   That's a fair counter argument.   However, I would propose that it's more acceptable since Quarians are a unique race, so at least she's focused around an alien concept, and not one which is so familiar as soldiers. So by embodying Quarians Tali is still adding substantial narrative value. I would also argue that relative to literature most characters in Mass Effect (and gaming as a whole) are quite poor, and despite my personal affection for several members of the Mass Effect cast I don't think they are very narratively deep or impressive. In fact that only character that ever impressed me in a BioWare game was Morrigan.  For the record, a lot of my post is worded more strongly than my arguments deserve (e.g. ""no value"" in his relationship with Shepard), and it doesn't sound like you're any less educated on the subject than I am.  I don't hate Vega either, the only strong emotion I feel is disappointment that we didn't get another new and unique companion in his stead. He's a palatable character, but feels unfocused and ultimately of little value. I think perhaps this is because the ""grunt"" (just another soldier) angle you reference is quite played out for me.   My post is far from objective, although I do hope it's at least rational."
masseffect,3dz26b,dodgysmalls,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:07:42 2015 UTC,"Sounds like we're roughly in the same camp. There was an aspect of of your original post that sounded like you were just putting your personal dislike of the character out there as a fact about him being weakly written, without any specifics at all. Clearly that's not where you're coming from.   I would also argue that relative to literature most characters in Mass Effect (and gaming as a whole) are quite poor, and despite my personal affection for several members of the Mass Effect cast I don't think they are very narratively deep or impressive.   That's certainly true. I'd put in a good word for Mordin though, but Mass Effect is about as good as you find in gaming. There's also the additional depth afforded by the visual design and voice actor, but if you just read the script for these characters they wouldn't be that great."
masseffect,3dz26b,meshaber,3,Tue Jul 21 09:08:55 2015 UTC,"Well, if anything, I liked James as a soldier buddy bro.  In my first full run of the trilogy (with ME3 being my first time going through it), James felt like the connection to the military I had more or less ignored due to leaving Ashley on Virmire for my FemShep. He also was the only squadmate that sounded something other than plain american, which gave an ""Earth-ly"" feel to his character (what with the spanish words here and there and calling FemShep Lola).  On my second run of the trilogy, I ran with Ashley to understand the character more rather than label her as racist/xenophobic, so I still had a military ""character"" along, but even then, while in ME1-2, Ashley's still the military soldier sis buddy, in ME3, she lost that feel by being a heck of a lot distant, rather always dramatic, her terrible new model and becoming a Spectre. James felt like the perfect character to reconnect the military soldier relation with my FemShep.  Of course, you do need to read a lot more into the character and maybe read more of his backstory to come to a full circle, but I didn't find him flat and static all that much.  I mean, if you're going to say James had a lack of backstory despite the few interactions and conversations with him, lets not talk about Kai Leng. :)"

Until that point I thought he was boring and I was going to off him, but I saw someone with emotions and personal conflicts, and right after that I went to Virmire.

I love the fact that Joker's the one guy from the whole crew who doesn't seem to walk on eggshells around Shep, he's honest, sometimes brutally so, and Shep (or at least, my FemShep) knows she can get the straight truth from him more than anyone else on the ship. He's also the first one in when Cerberus ""revives"" the Normandy and Shepard.  In my mind, Joker's the ""humanity"" on the whole ship. Sure we got human squadmates, but I don't feel as connected as a human to Ash and Kaidan as much as Joker. He's the ""normal"" human guy thrown in a pretty incredible situation. I mean, he doesn't have any biotic or combat prowess, his bones would break with a little tremor in the ship, but he sticks around with Shep from beginning to end."

My findings are about as far from scientifically sound as anything could possibly be, since I got them by using the first google results I found for average female measurements that appeared at least twice.   Average height for American women is about 163 or 164 centimeters. I averaged that to 163.5 for calculations.  Average hip width for nationally ambiguous women turned out to be around 35 cm. Divide 35 by 163.5 and you get .214, which rounded down means that on average, hip width equals about 21% of height. Next I took the first picture I found of a quarian female standing up straight and used an extremely advanced photo editor to find her height and hip width in pixels. This gave me 491 and 113, respectively. Making the same calculation with those numbers as with the human averages, I found that quarian women have hip widths that equal to about 23% of their height.   This gives you a 2% difference in the width-to-height ratio, but a staggering 9.5% increase in hip width overall assuming equal height across species. Marvelous."

The massive pop-ups will likely stop bothering you soon, they really swamp you a couple of times at the start but later on they usually just show up one at a time, and after that at least I'm not bothered by them.  I honestly didn't know it was possible to have an overall positive impression of the game at your stage, since I think the intro (up to where you're at) is terrible. I can only assume you will enjoy the hell out of the rest."

Gratifying actually, after you spend all your minerals upgrading and you can see where they went. Yeah the shortcuts were taken out. Maybe they planned on binding some function into them idk. I wasn't really bothered because I didn't use them much in 1.   IMO the only aspect that ME1 can claim to be better than the other games is its RPG elements. No other game in the series has an actual Inventory and in 1, collecting shit felt like it actually mattered, whether turning items to omnigel or selling them.   To me, the inventory system and RPG elements of the first game would have made the other games near perfect."
masseffect,3dzd37,xeqtioner0,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:11:18 2015 UTC,I guess it also bogged down a lot of people unnecessarily.   Another downside I can see is in terms of navigating the UI. You have to exclusively use the mouse now pretty much. Can use the spacebar or arrow keys to navigate. Hmmph.

masseffect,3dxuu6,Biowhere,3,Mon Jul 20 14:48:19 2015 UTC,"I always felt like that was a waste of a good track. Like, I want this song to play when the game is at its absolute most intense, but instead it's been sort of diluted by using it as the menu theme."
masseffect,3dxuu6,meshaber,3,Mon Jul 20 16:13:28 2015 UTC,There were different versions of the same song used throughout the game. I don't think using it as the menu theme cheapened it
masseffect,3dxuu6,Biowhere,2,Mon Jul 20 16:40:46 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure it does in practice, because it has that slow build-up section at the start which is fitting for a menu theme. I just always feel stressed as hell on the ME2 menu; normally when I start a game I might play around with the settings a little, make a cup of coffee before I jump into my actual character, leave it in the background while I settle in... with ME2 I feel forced to jump right in before it really gets going just so I won't have the epicness of that track diluted by using it for a menu."

masseffect,3dxuu6,djschemp,2,Mon Jul 20 18:44:10 2015 UTC,"Regardless of whether you think it's appropriate to put that track there, I love that theme and really miss it when I fire up ME3.

masseffect,3dxuu6,afatmess,2,Mon Jul 20 13:33:27 2015 UTC,"I think all themes are very good. The ME1 theme... it really gives you a feeling that what you're about to experience is unearthly. The sounds are ethereal, sometimes like a liquid flowing around you. For me this is a melody of the universe wanting to be noticed. It tells that our galaxy is rich, beautiful and full of mysteries beyond our comprehension and all that is lost in the vastness of the universe.    The ME2 theme. For me it states: I'm back. You can't stop me. I'm a rogue spectre and with my extraordinary team I'll fulfill my goal. Even if it kills me in the process. I love this theme, it gives me goosebumps and makes me feel badass. Like I'm finally unleashed and I will crash anything that's in my way.    The ME3 theme is very epic, with some heavier and ominous sounds that let you feel the gravity of situation. The fun is over, it's now or never. Either our greatest hopes will come true or we will perish forever. Then the notes change. It's a challenge - will you stand and fight for your world? Will you join us and give it everything you've got? If we don't make a stand, who will?     Hope it doesn't sound too weird, it's just a mix of feelings and images I have when listening to those themes. Picking one as my favorite seems almost impossible. Hmm, I guess it's Vigil, ME1 theme. It's the first sound of Mass Effect universe that I heard, one that enchanted me and made me excited every time I was about to continue my adventure."

masseffect,3dyfir,Redicus,10,Mon Jul 20 15:37:17 2015 UTC,"You are describing enemies with powerful melee attacks. Krogan can kill you in a hit or two, yep. Thorian creepers spray poison when they get up close, which takes you out quick as well. ME1 is not really about engaging in melee combat, so you get killed quick if you try.  I would think the answer is to not let yourself or your squadmates get hit. Backpedal, use your powers. I always save a Biotic lift or throw if I know I'm facing a charging Krogan."

masseffect,3dyfir,Tabnam,3,Tue Jul 21 17:53:15 2015 UTC,"ME1 has a fairly steep learning curve. It's easy to die loads at the beginning - once you've gotten some upgrades and levelled up a few times, it becomes much easier. The only thing you can really do is go slowly and carefully - try not to get surrounded and do your best to keep the enemies at a distance.  Use hammerhead rounds on things that charge you - it knocks them over and you can machine gun them on the ground.  The krogans don't like incendiary rounds either. Sets them on fire and stops them from getting back up when you think that you killed them already."

masseffect,3dyfir,cymikelee,2,Tue Jul 21 01:46:17 2015 UTC,"The squad member intelligence in ME1 is pretty atrocious, you basically have to tell them to do anything (like move into cover) but honestly just push through and get to a higher level.

masseffect,3dtra0,gathayah,9,Sun Jul 19 14:38:36 2015 UTC,What a game.   ... The best
masseffect,3dtra0,Pobobo,5,Sun Jul 19 20:42:44 2015 UTC,"Last year I played the series 3 times in a row so I'm saving my next playthrough until just before ME:A comes out.   I'm also still hoping on a ""Commander Shepard Collection"" with all DLC included (I haven't bought any ME:3 DLC yet)."
masseffect,3dtra0,Mazz0,4,Sun Jul 19 14:45:32 2015 UTC,"I was holding off on the DLCs as well but a few hours into ME3 i said f*** it and got from ashes and citadel. These were so good that I got leviathan as well after Rannoch. After the ending, I wanted more mass effect so I got Omega as well... so as much as I hate paying so much for these DLCs 2-3 years after release, I couldn't resist. And to be fair, the DLCs are pretty incredible."
masseffect,3dtra0,sushun,2,Sun Jul 19 15:34:45 2015 UTC,I will eventually buy them when there's absolutely no chance of a Commander Shepard Collection. Maybe in a year or so they'll finally drop the prices. I've heard many times how incredible they are but I just can't justify paying $15 for 1 DLC (which probably lasts 2-3 hours) when I bought the entire trilogy (easily 150+ hours) for $30.
masseffect,3dtra0,sushun,2,Sun Jul 19 15:42:55 2015 UTC,"Ya, I spent a lot more on these 4 DLCs than on the entire trilogy that I bought on sale... Pretty screwed up prices if u ask me."
masseffect,3dtra0,EllairaJayd,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:02:11 2015 UTC,"Citadel is well worth the $15. There's a good 6+ hours of content there, more if you love the combat simulator."

masseffect,3dtra0,jabbaciv,4,Sun Jul 19 11:28:08 2015 UTC,"I do like them, but it just makes me cry like a baby. I own all DLCs, but some of them I didn't have on my previous playthrough, so I'm still discovering new things and it's amazing. Leviathan is one of my favorites for sure. :)"
masseffect,3dwzgf,Jysta_Fitendor,2,Mon Jul 20 05:53:14 2015 UTC,Have you tried playing it on Borderless Window?
masseffect,3dwzgf,NebulaGray88,1 point,Mon Jul 20 05:54:27 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it showed up on my friends computer, but the cursor kept escaping from the window, and generally giving me a hard time as I had to click twice to shoot, close KSP every so often, ect."
masseffect,3dwzgf,NebulaGray88,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:35:20 2015 UTC,I don't get your problem. Just scale the game resolution to your screen resolution so that it occupies the whole screen and your mouse goes nowhere but in the game.
masseffect,3dwzgf,JoshSmith1998,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:48:14 2015 UTC,"I did, but the cursor still seems to be getting out, even worse than a smaller window. I""m not clicking things outside the game, but the mouse will occasionally not be bound to the window, and when I move it, my character doesn't move and so forth"
masseffect,3dwzgf,JoshSmith1998,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:31:19 2015 UTC,Play it in borderless so when you Alt+Tab out of the game it won't minimize it.
masseffect,3dwzgf,JoshSmith1998,1 point,Mon Jul 20 07:54:07 2015 UTC,"I tried borderless, and the issue I had with that was the cursor constantly escaping the window, which made gameplay fairly difficult"

masseffect,3dwzgf,robotic-logic,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:52:29 2015 UTC,There is a mod that directly supports 360 controllers but not ps3. I'm on mobile so I cant link you but it should be the one of the first links of you Google it.
masseffect,3dxeah,Sommyboy,5,Mon Jul 20 09:20:39 2015 UTC,I was kind of shocked to see that Bioware's internal stats show only 4% of player beat the game on Insanity. I've never play on anything lower.
masseffect,3dxeah,izmirtheastarach,3,Mon Jul 20 12:56:57 2015 UTC,Start vs. beat is a big difference. The courtyard section of Grissom Academy is brutal; I had to lower my difficulty for that section and I still died many times. Eventually just left it on Normal for the rest of my game and enjoyed not dying too much. I don't really care what the difficulty is as long as the game isn't simply handed to me.
masseffect,3dxeah,itsamamaluigi,2,Mon Jul 20 14:46:20 2015 UTC,"The courtyard section being where you fight the mech? I beat that something like 5 times yesterday playing around with different squad combos to see all the dialogue. I don't think I died once.  Really the only time I die is if I get impatient, and then it's my own fault."
masseffect,3dxeah,izmirtheastarach,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:32:29 2015 UTC,"It was pretty early in the game for me and I was playing Adept so I didn't have a great handle on how to use my powers. I just remember trying to go several different ways, up the right or down through the middle, and there were enemies on all sides including behind me so I couldn't really take cover anywhere. Lots of grenades too.  It's also an area that features infinitely spawning enemies until you advance, which necessarily involves charging into fire."
masseffect,3dxeah,itsamamaluigi,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:46:53 2015 UTC,"I guess I'm not clear on what area we're talking about. I don't remember any parts with infinite enemies. Either way, I've definitely beaten Grissom many times as an Adept, and I found it even easier on this Vanguard playthrough. I guess we're just having a different experience."
masseffect,3dxeah,izmirtheastarach,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:49:05 2015 UTC,This part.
masseffect,3dxeah,itsamamaluigi,2,Mon Jul 20 18:09:14 2015 UTC,"I gotcha. I did that part yesterday as well. As an Adept, I would head on up the ramp to the right and hold that top area. I think I'd only die if I got impatient, or failed to leap out of a grenade's range. You just stay up there, throwing out combos. They enemies are not infinite, BTW. While you can reduce the number that spawn by dashing forward, if you just take a strong defensive position, eventually the will stop pouring in and you can careful whittle the Mech down before moving on to the other side."
masseffect,3dxeah,izmirtheastarach,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:11:57 2015 UTC,"I'll have to try that next time I play it.  This was the first or second side mission I did in the game so I bet it would be easier now that I know those things. At some point the enemies just kept coming and coming and I assumed I'd have to move up to make them stop. I thought this happened a few times on Omega in ME2 as well but now I'm googling and apparently there are just tons of enemies, not unlimited."
masseffect,3dxeah,itsamamaluigi,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:24:45 2015 UTC,"Those Omega arenas are super interesting to get through as a Vanguard, because charging enemies that are far away and then jumping into cover there breaks to spawn points. If you are careful, you can bypass tons of reinforcements.  But yeah, there is usually a limit to the number of extras that will spawn. That courtyard map is not a super great design, because if you get out of the position the game wants you in, you can end up having groups of enemies drop down on your head. Fun as Vanguard, but less so for any other class."
masseffect,3dxeah,izmirtheastarach,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:27:27 2015 UTC,"I restarted that section a million times because I wanted to hijack the Atlas and get the achievement... only to eventually realize it's not possible in that segment.  Not sure how that makes sense, but okay."
masseffect,3dxeah,cymikelee,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:36:14 2015 UTC,"Oh god, Grissom Academy is by far the biggest difficulty spike in the entire game. Only other part that is comparable is at the end when you have to wait for the AA guns. So yeah once I got through Grissom, it was smooth sailing."
masseffect,3dxeah,srjnp,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:42:53 2015 UTC,I think Mother of All Mods has an edited Coelesced file for better AI among other great additions.
masseffect,3dxeah,NebulaGray88,1 point,Mon Jul 20 10:01:15 2015 UTC,"Better AI would be most appreciated. The me2 AI were smart and were actually acting like they want to kill me, especially the rushing shotgun squads."

ME2 has the worst AI I have ever... what? The only thing it does is shoot in your general direction if you're in cover, move around a bit, shoot a little. Focus fire on Shepard hard once you're out of cover. No attempts at flanking, no strategic positioning, no attempts at team work, just focus fire."
masseffect,3dxeah,meshaber,1 point,Mon Jul 20 11:04:29 2015 UTC,"Still, they gave me more trouble then mass effect 3 cerberus mobs"
masseffect,3dxeah,NebulaGray88,3,Mon Jul 20 11:14:45 2015 UTC,"That I can agree with, but I think it's the endless shields/barriers, AI has cleary improved.  Also, Shepard has become grotesquely overpowered by ME3, not sure how well ME2 Shepard would do in 3."
masseffect,3dxeah,srjnp,1 point,Mon Jul 20 11:55:12 2015 UTC,"Yeah, thats why im looking for mods, to have experience closer to me2 in terms of difficulty"
masseffect,3dxeah,meshaber,1 point,Mon Jul 20 12:22:42 2015 UTC,They mitigated the weak AI with overpowered cerberus turrets oh my fucking god those are the works of the devil.
masseffect,3dxeah,srjnp,1 point,Mon Jul 20 12:23:01 2015 UTC,"This. ME2 was difficult only because of how much time it took to strip away protection. ME3 makes you play smarter because enemies go down easy if you use the right power combos. ME2 was simply brute force to slowly strip their barriers, armor, shields."
masseffect,3dxeah,meshaber,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:40:54 2015 UTC,"Well, it's not like you're taking time out for stripping protection away if you're playing vanguard, but you still don't have the option to just put Liara's singularity on a group of troopers and have them be essentially taken out of the game, like you can in 3."
masseffect,3dxeah,BlakeTheTank,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:45:29 2015 UTC,"yeah, I could just stay behind cover and kill everyone without having to move.   Actually I had most problem with husks in ME2 because they were armored so I couldn't kill then instantly, and they drew me out of cover which exposed me to other enemies and I die pretty quickly because I'm an adept."
masseffect,3dxeah,meshaber,2,Mon Jul 20 16:38:40 2015 UTC,"I feel like that would be true if it wasn't because husks almost always only come at you without anything else, they never have backup from any collectors so you can usually just walk backwards and shoot.  But yeah, it's weird how adepts go from being absolute anti-husk machines to completely useless against them once you hit hardcore."

masseffect,3dx86m,ReturnToOcean,3,Mon Jul 20 09:34:53 2015 UTC,"I ran part of the BSN campaign back when the book was about to be released. When they apologized and committed to fixing it in a future edition, I considered that a victory. But really, why would there ever be a future edition if the first edition doesn't sell?   The entire point of my part of the campaign, the review drive, was to prevent people from buying the thing. So while I was happy to see Bioware acknowledge their error, I did not expect much more than that.   To me the point was to make sure this did not happen again in future. And having read the latest Dragon Age novel, which was another commissioned by a contract author, I feel pretty good about it. I enjoyed the book quite a bit."
masseffect,3dx86m,izmirtheastarach,3,Mon Jul 20 12:50:10 2015 UTC,Just think of it as bad fanfiction.

masseffect,3dwyy1,AmityN7,3,Mon Jul 20 05:46:57 2015 UTC,"Similar twist I've thought of that your post reminded me of: Mass Effect Nuzlock  Start playing on Insanity for realism. Basically you draw lots on who to bring every mission and if a squadmate dies, you never revive them manually and you treat them as dead and you cant do their loyalty mission forcing them to die on the suicide run. Don't even talk to them on the Normandy, just silently mourn their death."
masseffect,3dwyy1,NebulaGray88,1 point,Mon Jul 20 05:53:31 2015 UTC,That kinda takes the choice out of the player's hand though. What I like about this idea is it makes a whole bunch of new choices for the player.
masseffect,3dwyy1,NebulaGray88,1 point,Mon Jul 20 05:55:29 2015 UTC,This relies on micromanagement and skill more. You have to be more careful on where to place your squad and make them take cover in better positions. This is more of a challenge than an choice based playthrough. It adds the pressure of having to really protect your friends. Plus it tests dicipline. I plan to do this sometime.  Still your idea is much more doable and more random unless you've memorized the suicide mission squadmate death priority.
masseffect,3dwyy1,Vocado7,2,Mon Jul 20 05:58:15 2015 UTC,This is a pretty good idea. Just thinking about it makes my heart break but I'm excited to try it.
masseffect,3dwyy1,FR33Z1NG,2,Mon Jul 20 16:25:11 2015 UTC,"Glad to see I'm not the only one who intentionally makes hard choices in the game lol. Looks interesting, might try it on my next playthrough. On some play throughs, I'd romance Ash/Kaiden and then have my LI die on Virmire. This would be seen as an incredibly emotional choice for Shepard, and leaves ME2 open to new LI as well without cheating."
masseffect,3dx6er,Pettergjerde,3,Mon Jul 20 07:23:48 2015 UTC,"Soldier, just because it's okay to forget about powers other than AdRush. Press F6 whenever you can. Play on the lowest difficulty because ME1 is the hardest."
masseffect,3dx6er,NebulaGray88,1 point,Mon Jul 20 08:52:32 2015 UTC,"Gonna second this, even if many find soldier to be ""boring."" It's also more accessible since anything in the game dies if you shoot it enough. On easier difficulties you aren't in much danger. Soldiers can wear heavier armor in 1 and can use any weapon, specializing in whatever they like best.  Just having to think about power use, cooldowns, which powers are best for a given situation, maybe isn't the best for a novice gamer. You're ALWAYS holding and aiming your gun, it's just more straightforward."
masseffect,3dx6er,itsamamaluigi,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:39:54 2015 UTC,"See, I would say it depends on the person — I wasn't a ""gamer"" pre-Mass Effect, and found (and still find!) Adept to be far, far easier than Soldier, simply because my weapon-aiming skills suck nards. :)  My biggest recommendation for a new player is to not forget about the squad. Someone familiar with other games might focus too much on trying to take down everything themselves, instead of using the team to their best advantage.  I hope she has fun!"
masseffect,3dx6er,mayabuttreeks,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:23:26 2015 UTC,"Adept had a curve, starting as a pussy when Throw was on cooldown. But when nearing max level you could literally Stasis Saren to death and take no damage besides the difficulty where some enemies were immute. Not to mention the Lift-Throw-Throw combo.  Soldier is more consistent and once you learn the basic shooting mechanics, youre all set."

Set the difficulty lower than you'd play yourself, and then just let her make her own way. Part of why these games are so good is, because the world feels so authentic and real. If she's at least somewhat curious about background story, then she will walk up to all those npc's by herself and find out what they have to say. I love this game, because I experienced the story of MY shephard, not someone elses shephard. Let her pick the class she wants, it doesn't matter that much on a lower difficulty.  I'm repeating myself here, but just let her experience this wonderful world, she'll figure the game out soon enough. You did too, didn't you? ;)"
masseffect,3dx6er,Quawis,1 point,Mon Jul 20 11:10:47 2015 UTC,"In general - talk absolutely to everyone in game. Especially in ME3 as it will unlock quite a number of War assets. Make her talk to everyone.  Second - Renegade or Paragon in the end have the deiffrence of ~200 EMS. She can play whatever alignment she like.  Third - dependant on how she is good with shooting things - Soldier or Sentinel are very solid classes. Soldier is failsafe on lower difficulties and Sentinel can clear the game, without firing a single shot. If you need help with build for any part of trilogy - feel free to drop me a message. I will also gladly answer any ME question you have with best of my knowledge."
masseffect,3dx6er,Nicholas_,1 point,Mon Jul 20 11:55:03 2015 UTC,It's a long ass trilogy so if she wants to play all the games; she actually has to be dedicated for it to be of any value.
masseffect,3dx6er,FR33Z1NG,1 point,Mon Jul 20 12:37:12 2015 UTC,"I think Soldier would probably be the best class simply because you can easily get through the game on Casual without using a single power on your Shepard. The assault rifles are very versatile guns, so she shouldn't have to worry about switching weapons for any reason. I would say set the level ups to active for everyone if you don't think she can handle that, and set squad powers to active. ME1 is definitely the most difficult of the games, and it's pretty technical if you aren't used to RPGs. Tell her to hit F6 after every fight. I guess give her advice as needed."

masseffect,3du1ek,sorahito,2,Sun Jul 19 20:13:31 2015 UTC,"The loading screen bug is caused by missing files in the DLC. I don't know why but when you extract them into ME3's directory, they lose a couple of files. You better extract somewhere else then copy them inside. Hope that helps."

In the case of the former, it's interesting to see some of the parallels with ME..."

masseffect,3duwaq,IAmDarkridge,2,Sun Jul 19 22:00:36 2015 UTC,Honestly the elevator rides would have been so much better if there was more banter in the rides. I can only think of a handful of times your squad banters on the elevator.

masseffect,3dv7cw,Davetek463,4,Sun Jul 19 20:51:13 2015 UTC,I can only imagine how much nicer it looks on PC with graphics mods
masseffect,3dv7cw,Davetek463,2,Sun Jul 19 21:26:23 2015 UTC,I actually run it vanilla on PC and it looks fine to me. (Though I only have a mid-end laptop and don't wanna melt my rig).
masseffect,3dv7cw,Green-Whiskey,3,Sun Jul 19 22:04:48 2015 UTC,"I might be in the minority, but 2 had my favorite version of the Citadel. Though, in general, I lean more to the dirty/grimy feeling that 2's Citadel gives. 1 and 3 feel very clean and high class, 2 feels more night life/questionable government to me."
masseffect,3dv7cw,Davetek463,2,Mon Jul 20 02:58:59 2015 UTC,"questionable government   That's why I like the feeling in the first. It feels all super shiny and clean, but it also feels like there's something going on behind the scenes, like it's all too perfect."
masseffect,3dv7cw,Green-Whiskey,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:49:27 2015 UTC,"I see where you are going with that. I can agree. On first impression, the government in the first feels less like it was questionable or had behind the scenes workings, and more as though it was a very conservative, evidence based leading party vs. the newcomer, somewhat progressive, and more esoteric/empathy based party."
masseffect,3dv7cw,James_Easton,6,Tue Jul 21 01:26:52 2015 UTC,The story of the first game is great. Plus now you have Wrex :D
masseffect,3dv7cw,seagullfriend,5,Sun Jul 19 21:09:02 2015 UTC,"My biggest gripe about 3 is the lack of a Krogan squadmate. Not counting the Citadel DLC, where I always use Wrex."
masseffect,3dv7cw,meshaber,3,Sun Jul 19 21:15:26 2015 UTC,"I really liked James as a character, but I feel that his presence meant that the 'big guy' role in the squad was already filled to BWs satisfaction."
masseffect,3dv7cw,seagullfriend,5,Sun Jul 19 21:31:43 2015 UTC,"More likely they didn't want to make either Grunt or Wrex squad mates since they may not be around anymore (and Wrex has other concerns), and they rightfully felt like introducing a new krogan every game would get a little repetitive."
masseffect,3dv7cw,meshaber,8,Sun Jul 19 21:54:27 2015 UTC,"Well, I personally wouldn't have minded more squadmates in 3, even if it was just people from 2 returning.  Edit: I mean, there is literally no reason why Miranda could not have been a squadmate in 3. Her reason for not rejoining the Normandy crew didn't even make sense.  ""I'm hiding from Cerberus, so I won't stay on your stealth ship where I'll have multiple well-armed people protecting me from Cerberus."""
masseffect,3dv7cw,seagullfriend,4,Sun Jul 19 22:07:57 2015 UTC,"cough suicide mission cough.  Not that I disagree. I would love Grunt, Jack and Miranda on the Normandy in 3."
masseffect,3dv7cw,seagullfriend,3,Sun Jul 19 22:14:48 2015 UTC,"Miranda was one of the hardest people to kill in ME2 - moreso than Garrus or Tali. There was only one way that she could die, even if not loyal. Well, as far as I can remember."
masseffect,3dv7cw,meshaber,3,Sun Jul 19 22:18:07 2015 UTC,Pretty sure you can kill her if she is unloyal if you choose her to lead the 1st fireteam. And you kill her if you choose her as the biotic regardless of loyalty.
masseffect,3dv7cw,GeminiK,3,Sun Jul 19 22:29:51 2015 UTC,"Na.  If she's unloyal and leads the fireteam, she gets shot in the gut but lives.  As the biotic, if unloyal, she falls over at the end and one of your other teammates dies.  AFAIK, the only way for her to die is if you take her into the final battle when unloyal."
masseffect,3dv7cw,cymikelee,3,Sun Jul 19 22:35:28 2015 UTC,"I love how Miranda, a skinny, spandex dressed human, gets shot in the same way Grunt, a heavily armored superkrogan gets shot but shrugs it off even if she's not loyal."
masseffect,3dv7cw,PavanJ,2,Sun Jul 19 22:43:51 2015 UTC,Well i guess thats what I'll have to do when I kill her.
masseffect,3dv7cw,seagullfriend,2,Sun Jul 19 22:40:19 2015 UTC,What? You mean the scrawny girl can't lead a simple fireteam? I though you had the perfect genetics you bitch.
masseffect,3dv7cw,IAmDarkridge,2,Mon Jul 20 01:09:06 2015 UTC,Yeah TIL that you can actually kill her... from a fellow Redditor who had her die on her first playthrough...
masseffect,3dv7cw,Fuzzi0n,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:06:38 2015 UTC,Very annoying for those of us who kept everyone possible alive throughout the 1st and 2nd games.  Hated being stuck with James and EDI.
masseffect,3dv7cw,izmirtheastarach,7,Mon Jul 20 04:39:26 2015 UTC,"Yes, the combat is definitely more fluid in 2+3 compared to the first game. Bet you kept using the wrong buttons to shoot and select your weapons, rite?  I liked the large number of weapons and armor choices in ME1. It was too easy to accumulate multiples and fill your inventory with junk faster than you could get rid of it, sure - but I think that in trying to improve this, BW trimmed it down too much for ME2. Losing the different armors for your crew was a big loss, IMO - and it created some really silly-looking situations, e.g. Shepard and Zaeed running around in hard-shell armor with helmets and then Miranda alongside you in a catsuit and high heels with her eyes uncovered in a hostile atmosphere.  Yeah, it shoulda been different clothing when on the ship and armor for combat."
masseffect,3dv7cw,cymikelee,4,Sun Jul 19 21:11:09 2015 UTC,First thing I did was adjust the triggers. Still forget which ones to hit when doing interrupts in 2/3 but that;s a different issue.   And I think a lot of people had the same complaint about several squad members wearing basic gas masks instead of space suits when there was no environment. Like anyone of them would contaminate the hell out of the Quarian fleet during Tali's loyalty mission.
masseffect,3dv7cw,seagullfriend,4,Sun Jul 19 21:24:40 2015 UTC,"There may be more customization, but at the same time not really. None of the guns actually feel different which was my issue. The only difference is really stats. I also feel like most people would agree biotics are stronger in ME1 compared to ME2. They are definately at their strongest in ME3."
masseffect,3dv7cw,izmirtheastarach,8,Sun Jul 19 20:49:05 2015 UTC,I really hate how nerfed the powers are in 2. I do like each power having separate cooldowns in 1.
masseffect,3dv7cw,seagullfriend,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:18:46 2015 UTC,"It's far less of an issue if you remove the barriers/shields blocking biotics in ME2. In ME1 you can use them on any target which really speeds the combat up. Without that tweak in ME2 I found it was just easier to shoot everything rather than use any powers.  Unfortunately for you, on console, you're out of luck in that area which is a shame because it really adds a new dimension to the game. I find it stupid that Bioware even did it in the first place, it's like they wanted people to only play Soldier."
masseffect,3dv7cw,astalavista114,3,Mon Jul 20 03:13:03 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I always chuckle when people talk about there being ""more"" weapons in ME1. There are two or three models for each type. Everything is just reskins of the same guns, and the Geth ones are the only uniques. They all function the same, and the stats are all over the place."
masseffect,3dv7cw,Audemus77,4,Sun Jul 19 21:04:30 2015 UTC,"Well 99% of them ended up as omni-gel for me, so..."
masseffect,3dv7cw,qq_infrasound,5,Mon Jul 20 00:07:46 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but some of the guns are different colors!"
masseffect,3dv7cw,astalavista114,3,Sun Jul 19 21:14:19 2015 UTC,I LIKE THE RED ONE
masseffect,3dv7cw,mayanasia,2,Sun Jul 19 21:14:54 2015 UTC,"Which was the best one? The black one, I think it was? Just had a serial number or something and you could only get it at a high level..."

masseffect,3dv0uy,izmirtheastarach,3,Mon Jul 20 00:18:01 2015 UTC,"Paragon and renegade is a method of interaction with others, you're either the space hero that helps rescue a cat in a tree or the hero that tells the guy that lost his car keys to fuck off. There are perks to being a paragon or renegade specific Shepard, especially in ME2 where you have conflicts in your crew that require a certain amount of paragon or renegade points similar to your encounter with Wrex on Virmire. It expands your dialogue and helps you in situations where guns don't always help, like the speech perk in Fallout. ME2 is probably my favorite of the 3, I went right into it after playing ME1 and it just made me grow on the series even more."

masseffect,3dv0uy,florinandrei,4,Sun Jul 19 21:49:01 2015 UTC,"I think that's the reason they changed it in ME3 to a Reputation based system. You have access to a certain amount of Reputation next to Paragon and Renegade points if those are present in a conversation, and Reputation unlocks dialogue options. By far the best dialogue system in the trilogy, in my opinion."
masseffect,3dv0uy,FR33Z1NG,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:46:41 2015 UTC,"I totally agree.  In ME2 the dialogue options are useless, because if you want to save everyone and have a good ending you either always choose the top option or always choose the bottom option.  I like being paragon, but sometimes I just want to tell a guy to go f*** himself! In ME3, I can!"

masseffect,3dv0uy,Tribalrage24,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:42:17 2015 UTC,"If you start stacking up Paragon points, you get more Paragon options to solve various sticky situations later on in the game. Same for Renegade. A player with a high Paragon score unlocks Paragon-like ways to force certain outcomes. Same for Renegade. The game kinda encourages you to play dominant Paragon, or dominant Renegade, but by no means does it force you to play exclusively one or the other.  I tend to stick to Paragon because that reflects the choices I would make if I was in those situations, but I also tend to take Renegade options when there's no Paragon alternative. I end up being high Paragon with a good amount of Renegade background. In some cases I take the Renegade option just for the heck of it - like when you're given the option to punch the sleazy reporter."

With the data destroyed, Eve dies, hence no EMS from her.   So it's just Wrex in charge of the Krogan(assuming he survived ME1), so when he finds out about the sabotage and you have to kill him. So ultimately you lose his points, Eve's points and the full Krogan support points. Minimum EMS."

In the end, there isn't much of a difference, except the new council is made up of new dickheads. There is a bit more tension in ME2, but it's mainly cosmetic."
masseffect,3ds4i8,prewarpotato,15,Sat Jul 18 23:34:21 2015 UTC,"I always feel weird when I decide to go back and redo a decision, even if it is 'for the better'. I usually end up with this nagging feeling that this isn't my true game, and I should stick with how things went organically."

masseffect,3ds4i8,terefor,5,Sun Jul 19 15:15:32 2015 UTC,"ME 2 and 3 have a different council if you let the other die and some people react differently in dialogue, it's a pretty big change, but there's no reason to change your choice."
masseffect,3ds4i8,izmirtheastarach,4,Sat Jul 18 22:54:57 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the reply! Do people blame Shepard for what happened to the old council though? And how does this affect humanity's relations with the Asari and Turians? When I made the decision, I wasn't really considering how great it would look for the first human specter to have also saved the Citadel council! Yeah I picked Captain Anderson, Udina is a prick."
masseffect,3ds4i8,terefor,1 point,Sat Jul 18 23:01:02 2015 UTC,"People blame Shepard, but it doesn't really affect humanity's relations with other species, unfortunately the game is not that flexible and ME 2 and 3 are less politics focused and more Reaper focused."
masseffect,3ds4i8,izmirtheastarach,6,Sat Jul 18 23:07:50 2015 UTC,"How exactly does letting the council die save people? They are on board a ship with a crew of 10,000, who are all killed. Also, it's to be assumed that the council evacuates with their staff and whoever else happens to jump on board. All these civilians are likely also killed.   While both choices are valid and arguable, letting the council die leads to more deaths. The only lives it saves are human lives. By saving the council you are sacrificing a smaller number of human lives to save a greater number of alien ones."
masseffect,3ds4i8,terefor,1 point,Sat Jul 18 23:31:00 2015 UTC,"The option was to divert all forces to attack Sovereign, saving lives. Probably much more than 10,000."
masseffect,3ds4i8,izmirtheastarach,8,Sat Jul 18 23:57:54 2015 UTC,"It doesn't though. I'm not sure where you are getting that idea. If you save the Ascension, the Alliance loses 8 cruisers. Each has a crew of 300, or 2400 in total. Hence saving the council saves human lives, but more are lost overall. These numbers come directly from Shepard. They are also in the codex.  Saving the Council is the Paragon choice. Intentionally letting them die is the Renegade choice. This is confirmed by the points awarded. (28 Paragon for saving them / 29 Renegade for letting them die.) The third option is pragmatic. You are saving your forces for the final push instead of wasting them saving the Ascension, so the points awarded are neutral (8 & 8). However, the deaths are the same with either of the latter choices.  Again, I want to stress that all choices are valid. It's also totally okay to not be aware of all this nonsense, because I get that not everyone has played every game 10 times and read the entire wiki back to front."

masseffect,3ds4i8,VonShnitzel,2,Sun Jul 19 03:13:14 2015 UTC,"Shepard says it has a crew of 10,000. One assumes they are Asari military, so not really civilians. Though I did suggest earlier that it's reasonable to assume that when the council boarded they might have taken on some other civilians. Support staff and the like.  If you don't pay super close attention you might not know exactly how many people are aboard, but certainly the scene at the beginning of the game tells you that it's the flagship of the Citadel Fleet and is larger than anything in the Alliance fleet. There's also a Volus on the Citadel who takes about a tour he was given of it, where he suggests that it has almost as much firepower as the rest of the Asari fleet combined."
masseffect,3ds4i8,izmirtheastarach,-1,Sun Jul 19 04:03:32 2015 UTC,"What about the Alliance ships destroyed in battle?Honestly,I don't see how sacrificing humans lives and military power is a good thing,at least not  from humanity standpoint."
masseffect,3ds4i8,Allanlemos,4,Sun Jul 19 00:55:41 2015 UTC,"IMO saving the council is a better moral choice. If you choose to save them, the alliance loses something like 6-8 cruisers, or around 2,000 people, but it also greatly improves the galactic opinion of humanity. If you let them die, you lose the most powerful ship in the Citadel fleet, the 10,000 people aboard the ship, as well as the ships/people that get destroyed when attacking Sovereign. Doing this also somewhat lowers the galactic opinion of humans. The difference in human lives and equipment lost is very low compared to what gets saved by helping the council."
masseffect,3ds4i8,izmirtheastarach,1 point,Sun Jul 19 01:14:19 2015 UTC,"Makes sense to me.  For me (or my canon Shep, however you want to look at it), it's also a matter of how seriously you take the idea of being a Spectre. I took it seriously, which means my job is to safeguard the lives of all council races.   I played ME1 as soon as it came out on the PC, so I was taking the story as it came. I was a Spectre, no longer just an Alliance soldier. I still stick with refusing to let that jagoff Admiral Mikhailovich inspect the Normady with his snide comments. I don't work for you anymore, guy."
masseffect,3ds4i8,Allanlemos,0,Sun Jul 19 01:22:36 2015 UTC,"You've made a good point,but on the other hand,the Asari hadn't done almost anything to humanity at that point,so I as human had no obligation of saving them but I did have the obligation of saving human lives,to me it didn't feel right to sacrifice them in order to save a bunch of politicians.I'm not saying that humans are more worth than Asari,but I'm not an Asari."
masseffect,3ds4i8,izmirtheastarach,3,Sun Jul 19 01:29:20 2015 UTC,Wheras I feel that all lives are of equal value. I certainly don't require anyone to have done something for me to feel like their life has value.
masseffect,3ds4i8,izmirtheastarach,-1,Sun Jul 19 01:57:09 2015 UTC,"It's not what I meant,my point is Shepard is human,so he had more obligations with humanity than with Asari,if you were amid a war and had to choose between saving the lives of your countrymen or saving foreigners,witch opition would you choose?"
masseffect,3ds4i8,izmirtheastarach,4,Sun Jul 19 02:05:02 2015 UTC,"I feel like I've already answered this. I'd do whatever saved the largest number of lives. If I don't value other sentient life less, why would I value other human beings less?  If you are trying to use an analogy that puts us in the modern world, then it feels like this argument kind of falls apart.   Canada and the US are involved in a war. During a pivotal battle I can either sacrifice 2400 Canadian soldiers and save 10,000 American soldiers, or vice versa.    I can't imagine what military commander would let 10,000 allied troops die because his own troops might die rescuing them."
masseffect,3ds4i8,Gromit43,2,Sun Jul 19 02:13:32 2015 UTC,"Which is a totally valid view to have. Certainly my Paragon Shepard would disagree with you, but that's one of the fun things about Bioware games. We each get to make our own choices."

masseffect,3dt0tw,plaidchuck,6,Sun Jul 19 04:18:33 2015 UTC,"You can get pretty much everything. There is no cap. I've never finished the game without fully maxing out almost every upgrade. I usually just buy them immediately when I see them. The only thing I leave till later is the Heavy Bone Weave, because that seems the least useful for my playstyle.  You can reset your skill points from the medbay at any point. Just max out the powers you actually use and leave the rest till later."
masseffect,3dt0tw,izmirtheastarach,2,Sun Jul 19 04:25:50 2015 UTC,"Yeah you can get everything but there is ABSOLUTELY a cap on money and platinum/iridium/eezo/palldium in the game. Money is usually found during missions and also awarded by the Illusive man while the four elements are found and during missions and scanned using the galaxy map interface! I think the ME wiki states that you can't get every upgrade in the base game with no import bonuses, but if you have the ""Rich"" import bonus or ant DLC (the missions there pay relatively well) then you should be able to buy anything. But I'd double check for myself of I was you, instead of asking here!  http://masseffect.wikia.com/wiki/Planet_Scanning"
masseffect,3dt0tw,Soaring_Goat,3,Sun Jul 19 07:00:09 2015 UTC,"It's more than possible to get every upgrade without importing or DLC. I scanned about 4-5 star systems with DLC and import bonuses and had more than enough for every upgrade with over 100,000 left over for each for those ME3 War Assets. There's over a dozen other systems I didn't spend time scanning that could provide the 50,000 each that importing gives you."
masseffect,3dt0tw,toxictaliban111,1 point,Sun Jul 19 07:28:19 2015 UTC,"If by cap you mean that there is not an unlimited amount of resources in the game, then I suppose that is true.

masseffect,3dt0tw,izmirtheastarach,3,Sun Jul 19 12:37:31 2015 UTC,"Ammo powers are incredibly useful at every point in the game, and there's no downside to having them active at all times. It's just a matter of picking the most useful one against certain enemies.  Resources are not capped at all, you can stock up as much as you want whenever you want. It costs a very small amount of credits, so the only limit is your patience because planet scanning is tedious."
masseffect,3dt0tw,sizesixteens,1 point,Sun Jul 19 07:04:37 2015 UTC,Get upgrades that you think matters to you. They aren't that expensive since you start with 50k minerals when you got the Rich Achievement. You can reset talents and also reset bonus powers.  Ammo powers are more useful because some work against extra defenses like armor and shields and barriers. Incendiary and cryo only affects unprotected enemies but still useful for crowd control because they make enemies panic/freeze.
masseffect,3dso4b,hihellowhatsupm8,4,Sun Jul 19 02:02:44 2015 UTC,"Well, what class did you pick? Because each class ""specializes"" in weapons (like the Infiltrator class specializes in snipers/pistols). Depending on what your class is built for (like if it's built for assault rifles and shotguns), then put points into those branches to increase their damage and such. That's just weapons, though. There's other branches that improve your dialog skills, shields, health. It really just depends on what you want, honestly. And don't stress it too much, it's helpful, but you won't get completely wrecked if you don't spec into everything exactly right."
masseffect,3dso4b,aadmiralackbar,3,Sun Jul 19 04:40:44 2015 UTC,Default! Soldier I think. I read that I shouldn't put points into charm because you end up getting them anyway?
masseffect,3dso4b,ANAL_JUICE_COLLECTOR,5,Sun Jul 19 05:59:37 2015 UTC,"You can get up to 4 free points into Charm or Intimidate when you reach certain thresholds of Paragon/Renegade points, but a good amount of dialogue options require more investment on your part. It just depends on how many situations you want to resolve through persuasion instead of combat, paying money, or whatnot.  As for the rest of your talents, my advice is to put a little bit into several branches, try those out and see what you like best and focus on your favorites. Don't worry about what people say is optimal, play how you want to."
masseffect,3dso4b,sizesixteens,3,Sun Jul 19 07:14:36 2015 UTC,"It's up to you. If you know what kind of play-style you want, like gung-ho melee fighter, long-range assassin, quick-moving attacker or anything else, you can probably make a good guess as to which skills would most benefit your character.   If you don't know, or you want some flexibility, I'd say get the first few points in all the skills and try them all out. For me, some are more fun, some make things easier and some I barely use as I tend to play the same way every time.  As a soldier, you can use any of the weapons. Other classes, like biotics, are restricted to pistols and shotguns but you get the widest range. You can also wear the heaviest armour types. I'd suggest playing around with everything and see what you enjoy most. Look at what the final talent points in each tree give you. If something sounds cool, aim for that.  As for the charm and intimidate, these make you more persuasive in conversations and give you small benefits when shopping. With higher scores here, you can talk people into or out of doing things when the red and blue dialogue options come up on the conversation wheel. If there are options greyed-out, it means you're not charming or intimidating enough in that particular situation. If you're all about the shooting and don't really care for the conversations, or you're not trying to be the baddest badass or pinnacle of paragon, these two skill lines might be ones you don't invest many points in. If you really get into the roleplaying, like exploring the dialogue and want to be so awesome you don't even need a gun to save the day, these might be quite satisfying. (This advice may be biased by my own play style...)  In the end, you won't fail the game by choosing or not choosing a talent. Whether you have a favourite ability and max it out or prefer to spread your points across many skills, I think the most important thing is to play around and have fun."
masseffect,3dso4b,CmdrPineapple,2,Sun Jul 19 15:08:00 2015 UTC,Thanks! So should I max charm if I like additional dialogue options? Or do you get points put in charm for you automatically by doing things like I've read?
masseffect,3dso4b,CmdrPineapple,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:07:21 2015 UTC,"It's not that new conversations open up with higher charm/intimidate scores, but that some of the possible responses are only available if your skill levels are high enough.  I believe if you hit 75% paragon or renegade you get four points along the way in charm or intimidate respectively. To get more charming or intimidating you need to assign other points yourself. I think the higher slots in each talent branch only become available if your paragon/renegade score is past a certain level i.e. you can't max out charm right at the start. It's been a few months since I played ME1 though, and the details have been overwritten in my mind with ones from ME2 and ME3.  Invest your points however you feel like at that stage in the game. Your approach may change as you complete the missions and get further into the story. Honestly, as much as I love playing a charming, full-paragon Shep, I actually like encountering situations where I can't talk someone down. It's more satisfying where there are no guarantees, where sometimes your best still isn't good enough. And that's OK."
masseffect,3dso4b,heikurashi,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:26:53 2015 UTC,"If you do all the side quests you'll eventually end up with more points than you know what to do with. But for weapons, put points into the weapon you use the most.   When you get someone with Electronics ans Decryption, max those out (to the third triangle) before doing any thing else for them, you can find stuff on other planets that requires master electronics.

I just lose too much of the roleplaying element to warrant not getting every point I can get here. Even Eden Prime requires you to ""charm"" in parts of it.  Next, I try to max out my primary damage source. For instance, on a Soldier I'll max Assault Rifles first, on an Infiltrator I'll focus on Sniper Rifles. However, on an Adept I might focus on Throw or Lift or whichever power I'm going to be using most.   After that, I'll get my defensive talents like Armor, Fitness, and Spectre. After that, just fill out the tree as needed.   Whatever you do, focus on it early because later in the game you'll get only 1 point per level up and talent progression becomes much slower."

I'm a JC fan, but even I know that music doesn't fit the Mass Effect universe. There are already a few videos out there that put Mass Effect style music over the Mass Effect Andromeda trailer.  Here is my version, enjoy - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XUAjyEVxlGE - Mass Effect Andromeda Trailer - Proper Music - Proper being defined by similar music that is in ME1, ME2, ME3.  If you want to see proper music for a cowboy frontier theme, check out the firefly theme song.  If they are going to completely change what Mass Effect is, then they should call the game something else, don't call it Mass Effect if it's going to be a cowboy/frontier sci-fi game. A cowboy/frontier  is not what Mass Effect is about. This theme was never present in ME1, ME2 or ME3."
masseffect,3dvhtu,meshaber,7,Sun Jul 19 21:39:16 2015 UTC,"The song is just there for a ""new frontiers"" feeling in the announcement trailer, don't read too much into it.  I am somewhat confused by the actual song you chose to use, it's not particularly Mass Effect-y for a Mass Effect song. It worked pretty well though, at least during the first part.  Edit: Wait, how did the original ME not have a bit of a new frontiers thing going for it?"
masseffect,3dvhtu,DinerWaitress,2,Sun Jul 19 21:49:46 2015 UTC,"Cause the trilogy isn't about ""discovering and exploring"" rather than ""doing things left and right"". In the trilogy, most worlds you visit are already colonized/inhabited/visited already. You as the player are exploring a ""new world"" but Shepard's been there and done that already, nothing's actually new except... y'know, Geth in Council space, Reapers, maybe going on the Citadel (it is for Ash, not sure for Shep), the Collectors, Prothy the Prothean, etc..."
masseffect,3dvhtu,terefor,2,Sun Jul 19 23:10:02 2015 UTC,"In ME2 and 3 sure, but in the first game you're navigating some very murky waters. Humanity finding its place in the new world they've suddenly (relatively speaking) found themselves in is a pretty big thing in aspects of the main plot and is pretty much the reason for all of those godforsaken Mako sections (come on, humanity's first spectre and foremost badass is taking time off to scout out mining prospects). It's...debatable how westerny that is, but I don't see how this can be considered out of place."
masseffect,3dvhtu,meshaber,2,Sun Jul 19 23:20:25 2015 UTC,"Even then, you're not exploring new territories, you're walking on a path already beaten down by others before you. Sure you're the first human spectre, but not the first candidate (Anderson) or the first actual spectre. Humanity's already established too, they have an ambassador and already live on the Citadel and have already colonized other planets and etc.   Sure you've got the Mako missions, but a lot of those are given with the whole ""we sent a recon team/a team of scientist was lost/someone's hiding there"", meaning that whoever is giving you those missions already know about these places.  Shepard was 3 years old when the actual discovery of turians was made by human (born 2154, war started/ended in 2157). Since then, humanity as a whole has discovered and learned about the neighboring species surrounding them.  That said, I would've agreed if ME1 was about the First Contact War/Post-War, exploring the Citadel space and wandering about, but by the time the events of ME1 kick in, the exploration of a new world concept doesn't apply in my opinion. Humans know what asari, turians and krogans look like. They know they each have a homeworld, some might've even visited them already, or at least, colonies and the humans are already pretty well established around the galaxy."
masseffect,3dvhtu,Co-opingTowardHatred,2,Sun Jul 19 23:56:37 2015 UTC,"I just think that if you're going to argue that an exploration concept has no precedence in the series, you'll need to define it somewhat narrowly. ""Finding your place in the new world"" and ""turning over previously unturned rocks in the new world"" are pretty closely related. Sure, ME1 took place at a later exploration stage than Andromeda probably will, but you can still feel that it was there a decade earlier."

Comparing Turians to avians is also inaccurate, as what kind of bird has a carapace?

masseffect,3dmwd8,Bleevocker,12,Fri Jul 17 19:30:44 2015 UTC,"If Mordin dies, Padok Wiks replaces him in ME3. He just hangs around the Normandy medbay and is on Surkesh if you have Mordin."
masseffect,3dmwd8,seagullfriend,6,Fri Jul 17 21:02:11 2015 UTC,"Wiks is quite an interesting character in his own right. I don't know if 'creationist scientist' is the right way to describe him, but he's a scientist who believes in a higher power."
masseffect,3dmwd8,Bleevocker,9,Fri Jul 17 21:21:38 2015 UTC,Doesn't Mordin also talk about religion during his loyalty mission and how his genophage work made him more spiritual or something? I do remember that he prayed for one of the dead Krogan that Maelon experimented on.
masseffect,3dmwd8,meshaber,9,Fri Jul 17 21:26:21 2015 UTC,"The way I understand it, he had a bit of a crisis of conscience post-genophage modification.

masseffect,3dmwd8,seagullfriend,2,Sun Jul 19 02:23:23 2015 UTC,Well Wiks talks about how he once got into a violent argument with Mordin over religion. Wiks asserted that evolution could not exist without God's (or a god) will driving it. Mordin strongly disagreed.

masseffect,3dpj1g,MrGrotchWillis,6,Sat Jul 18 07:11:59 2015 UTC,"They won't.  Origin stories are generally easier.  The writers will be able to use elements of the ME universe without having to ""wrap everything up into a bow""."
masseffect,3dpj1g,fallingshort,4,Sat Jul 18 07:29:55 2015 UTC,"Hey Dragon Age: Inquisition had a great story, and mass effect 3 also had a great story, they just failed to wrap it up well the first time."
masseffect,3dpj1g,IBangYoDaddy,1 point,Sat Jul 18 12:34:17 2015 UTC,"I fully disagree. Inquisition has almost no story and the villain is terribly written. ME3 has a few high notes but it's 75% crap(Crucible ass pull, forced emotion, Cerberus nonsense, cliched army gathering, everyone in the galaxy acting against their own self interests, and of course, the ending)."
masseffect,3dpj1g,buttsbuttsbutt,6,Sat Jul 18 22:02:00 2015 UTC,"Not necessarily true. Don't get me wrong, I LOVE Mass Effect, but the first game was essentially ""beat the bad guy so that he doesn't use the doomsday device."" That was the overall point to the main storyline of the first game, which is actually pretty cliche.   What made it special for me were two important factors. First, the lore. Some people confuse this for the plot, but it's not the same. The lore is everything that happens around the story. What fleshes out the universe. The second bit is the characters; their motives, their personalities, and the ability to really connect with them (as both friends and enemies).   The story might connect those pieces together, but the pieces themselves need to be strong. That's why they are more important."
masseffect,3dpj1g,ski-doo,3,Sun Jul 19 08:05:19 2015 UTC,Yup. If the opening scene talked about how you had an injury that made it impossible to fall in love it wouldn't bother me one bit.
masseffect,3dpj1g,Saneless,26,Sat Jul 18 23:10:03 2015 UTC,"I want the dialogue system in general to be as good, if not better, than the trilogy's. Perhaps iron out some of the gaps between text and actual dialogue, lower the amount of autodialogue... That sort of thing."
masseffect,3dpj1g,evilweirdo,12,Sat Jul 18 15:03:43 2015 UTC,"In the first mass effect you were choosing your direct response. However, in the third I felt that you were choosing your line of thought and Shepard responded using that line of thinking, which personally I liked more."
masseffect,3dpj1g,SpecialAgentPotato,6,Sat Jul 18 05:32:50 2015 UTC,"I share this view, both autodialogue and chosen dialogue have their place and I think ME3 is closer to the sweet spot than the other two games, but I do think it went too far with the autodialogue, as well as not always employing it correctly.  I mean, autodialogue can make for some much better exposition and quest giving than branching dialogue can (why do we still have investigate trees? If there's one use for autodialogue it's getting rid of the all important choice between which order I will ask Jack about her old crimes and replacing it with a smoother dialogue). Throw it in there for introductions and technobabble, the player character asking for the kind of mission critical information that no sensible roleplaying should feel adverse to, but please Bioware, be a little more careful about throwing emotions and specific attitudes into the autodialogue."

If anything, i wish they would have a working banter-system. Like this, banter starts - goes on for a bit, gets interrupted by firefight, and resumes with a ""so, what were we talking about?"" And continue on that topic.. Its stupid, but.. Since banter gives insight to your follower and that insight contributes to our liking/understanding said character, i hate to miss it because some robot in a leotard decided to attack.

masseffect,3dpj1g,grogleberry,3,Sat Jul 18 10:19:27 2015 UTC,"I like the sound of this as well because there were several moments when I thought,  ""Just 3 people are going on the Collector Ship or the final missions through London?""    I mean those were HUGE battles and even larger moments in the story.  Those should have required EVERYONE, even if most the team were in bot mode."
masseffect,3dpj1g,PowerBrick99,2,Sat Jul 18 13:17:10 2015 UTC,"I recently finished my first play through of the series and thought the exact same thing going through London. There is such a shortage of good soldiers at many points in the game, why are we asking more than half of our all star team to sit in their barracks while we fight for the survival of the galaxy."
masseffect,3dpj1g,stardebris,2,Sun Jul 19 04:00:19 2015 UTC,"I think they just ran out of money or time.  There were audio files recorded for Geth Primes helping you out in London, but we never saw that. We never saw any of the troops you recruited.  I feel like they had an idea of the scale of the ground assault, involving all your allies and maybe, like the other planet-based story missions, you would've had different drop zones around Earth helping out different factions, but they were never able to deliver, so instead they gave you 2 pretty small-scale missions and everyone was just assumed to be off fighting somewhere else."
masseffect,3dpj1g,grogleberry,2,Sun Jul 19 06:56:59 2015 UTC,"I totally agree. A thing that really breaks the immersion for me, especially in 2, is that you recruit this kick-ass team of the most bad-asses in the galaxy, just for most of them to sit around on your ship for 90% of the game. Wow fighting off waves and waves of collectors would be a lot easier if the super biotic, perfect krogan specimen, master assassin, asari justicar, and expert vigilante, that I spent so much time recruiting, could all be here helping"

The members of the ship's crew are pretty much why I enjoyed the Mass Effect Trilogy as much as I did.  Without them being as interesting as they were, I wouldn't have really felt a need to put as much time as I did into the games."
masseffect,3dpj1g,OniLink96,3,Sat Jul 18 12:21:43 2015 UTC,"Yeah this is my vote too. ME2 was my favorite of the series because I liked so many of the squad members. ME3 was a huge step back in that, and I think that's why I'm struggling to finish it."
masseffect,3dpj1g,Kerse,1 point,Sat Jul 18 19:41:56 2015 UTC,"I felt the same way my first playthrough of ME3.  In ME2 you can go talk to any squad mate, any time, and really get to know them. You would have meaningful conversations and ask them about their past (eventually these dialogues would run out though, and the squad mate would become a lifeless background object). ME3 removed this and lowered the number of long personal conversations, sometimes squad mates didn't feel like talking at all.  From my most recent playthrough however, I have learned to appreciate it much more.  Your crew in ME3 feels much more organic, they have dialogue which relates to what is happening at that moment, and don't just have 2-4 sets of limited dialogue.  More importantly they move around the ship and interact with each other.  Sometimes I would go to talk to garrus, only to find out he is in the lounge having a drink with Javik.  Listening in and then contributing to conversations between sqaud mates really brought the interaction to the next level, where it felt like your crew was a large family of friends, all comfortable around each other, and less like you were a therapist going in to check on each squad mate."
masseffect,3dpj1g,Tribalrage24,18,Sun Jul 19 21:18:22 2015 UTC,"For me it's exploration. I don't want to just go into an area and feel like it's a corridor shooter. Sure the areas they put you in aren't always narrow, but it's (almost) always on such a grand backdrop that I can't help but feel constrained. Of course I'd like the story to be on point but that's already a given - I'd rather talk about something different"
masseffect,3dpj1g,luemasify,7,Tue Jul 21 15:18:28 2015 UTC,"See, I'd rather we had narrow areas. I would much rather have really tight, linear areas with incredible writing (Dragon Age Origins) rather than huge, beautiful, empty landscapes to explore. (Dragon Age Inquisiton)"
masseffect,3dpj1g,OnBenchNow,2,Sat Jul 18 06:32:14 2015 UTC,"Fair enough. When I said I'd want some larger areas I was thinking more in line with the worlds we'd land on in ME1. You'd have some area to traverse until you come across a key building and when you're inside you've got those tight(er) areas and hallways that make for more action-packed third person shooter gameplay. In a shooter you need to have those types of areas but I just don't want that to be the only areas we're placed in. Having a LARGE world like in DA but with guns Mass Effect style would get pretty ridiculous in terms to the shootouts (also we already have Fallout for that kind of game) so I'm kind of thinking about it in terms of having multiple planets, each one has an overworld (doesn't have to be humongous), and then you've got buildings or caves or underground facilities to go through with those tight narrow hallways we're used to seeing"
masseffect,3dpj1g,luemasify,4,Sat Jul 18 18:04:12 2015 UTC,"This would, and should, be the largest section of the game.  Looking back at the first game, where you really did explore (rather than just do side-missions), if you wanted to do everything, about 70% of the game would be spent on non-story-mission planets.  Making this fun and replayable is the biggest key to this games single player longevity, IMO.  They need the number of destinations from ME1 (if not more), the ability to search a large section of the planet without any restrictions other than the area of operation (no impassable terrain or invisible walls).  But they need to populate them with fewer cookie-cutter buildings, less boring terrain, and throw in some procedurally generated events - everything in ME1 exploration was scripted - the Thresher Maws and so on.  They also need to make mining and other acquisition of goodies less of a chore but avoid virtually streamlining it out of existence like in ME3."
masseffect,3dpj1g,grogleberry,2,Sat Jul 18 19:37:22 2015 UTC,"can you guys imagine, No Man's Sky + Mass Effect ??! nerdgasms"
masseffect,3dpj1g,EpicSalmon,2,Sat Jul 18 10:06:44 2015 UTC,"Exactly, if we're just moving through hallways and tight interiors for the entire game then let's be real: there's little replay value left in that. Currently, ME's replay value comes from choosing different dialogue options, becoming a different Shepard with the Paragon/Renegade pathways etc., in some cases choosing who lives/who dies, and to a lesser extent the option of different LI's. Having a larger world where there's goodies hidden out of view and more places to explore would be great for replay value and once again, we're going to a new solar system - exploration is the FIRST thing on my mind!"
masseffect,3dpj1g,luemasify,1 point,Sat Jul 18 11:45:17 2015 UTC,"And having good emergent gameplay is a really easy way to do it as well - rather than having to sculpt an entire set-piece - from the behaviour, to the backdrop, you just have stuff happen all by itself, forever."

William fucking Shakespeare's writing is carried by his dialogue, not his plots.   With that said: Details. Technobabble. I want the codex hugely expanded and I want more or less everything in it to be noticable in game, if only subtly. I want military ranks to feel like they matter (no need to go full military, just give a clear chain of command on the ship) and your character's reputation to be reflected in how people speak to you, not which dialogue options you can access.

The Reapers are just doing what they are designed for, so the question is if the actions of the AI are justified. In the sense of completing its task, they are. In any sense that benefits sentient life in the galaxy, they aren't. There is no real benefit to individual races, since they are basically slaughtered.

That part made me think the actual Reapers themselves are probably a tad delusional.  And while they may have some sort of connection to the beings they once were, the individual beings used to create them are absolutely killed. We see them ""harvested"", which turns out to mean liquefying them alive. My point is that to the AI & the Reapers, they are harvested to make room for new life.

I just recently played and beat the trilogy and it was a painful last few days as I say farewell to my FemShep. With everything fresh and still bleeding emotionally, I must admit that my initial reactionary response to the question posed by the OP was ""F*ck the Reapers!""  In the Leviathan DLC Sheppard was told that ""The Intelligence"" was created and tasked with the objective of ""preserving life at all costs"" because tribute does not flow from dead slave species. Things went haywire in that the Intelligence/AI/Catalyst concluded that no matter what synthetics will always overcome their creators and conclude that all organics need to eradicated.  What the AI does based on it's conclusion is just a selective form of the problem it perceived. It never believes that peace could ever exist between synthetics and organics. If I had -any- feelings that what the Reapers and the AI did were justified are crushed by the fact that they TAILORED the galaxy to force the path of advance development. They sprinkled these Mass Relays and made the Citadel as a method to expedite the growth and evolution of civilizations. Evolution was a tool for the AI to funnel species into a death trap. They have denied the natural order and progression of advancement of civilizations and taken away the freedom of each cycle to advance themselves.   So do I think the Reapers' actions were justified? No."
masseffect,3dq77e,KnightofReknown,5,Sat Jul 18 20:26:21 2015 UTC,"I think we cannot comprehend.  In a more serious note... I can understand their logic. However, in this very cycle Shepard is able to demonstrate (depending on player choices, but the possibility is there) that war between synthetics and organics doesn't always have to happen. Both organics and synthetics just have to adapt, respect each other and learn to coexist. In my opinion, if Geth can find peace with the Quarians after centuries, if EDI can be part of an organic crew (more like a family) and be loved and respected as any other member... I don't see why other synthetics and organics can't do the same. Yeah it will take time, and it requires effort from both sides, but it's possible. And this totally makes the reapers obsolete.  On the other hand, my personal opinion is that the galaxy's inhabitants should really have the chance of learning by themselves. What's the point of keeping peace by purging entire races? For me it would make more sense if they just let people evolve, and only intervene if things got out of hand if they really just want to keep the galaxy from going FUBAR."

The people he is a dick to don't.   A theme of mass effect is the consequences of your actions. If you behave like a mistrustful, manipulative asshole, or a callous asshole, or just an asshole, or decide the Geth are worth more so fuck the Quarians, there will be consequences.

Nevermind the fact that Mass Effect has never said everything will go perfectly no matter what your decisions are.  Nevermind that a renegade playthrough nets you only about 100 less war assets.  Nope, Renegade is entirely pointless because there are consequences. Those war assets that you still get enough of to get the best ending totally invalidate the narrative and emotional impact of everything else.  And how exactly does that Wrex bit go in your mind? Does Shepard threaten him? Because you do realize he is a Krogan, right? And that you essentially fucked up his life's work.

Your problem is that you're incorrectly attaching the paragon/renegade label to decisions that aren't paragon or renegade. Depending on your playthrough, you can easily set it up so that not curing the Genophage is actually the ""paragon"" decision.  Get this through your thick-ass skull. The Genophage isn't a paragon/renegade decision. The Geth/Quarians aren't a paragon/renegade decision either. Nor is Maelon's data.  There may be extenuating circumstances, or repercussions from your previous misstep that makes one easier than the other, but non of those have a morality choice in there.  As for the war assets, there's a total tally available for both full paragon and renegade. Just checked, at the time of  this paragon nets you exactly 73 extra god damn war assets. To get maximum, you need to do a paragade playthrough.

If somebody was to appear, I would be fine with Anderson. Maybe some explanation as to the importance of our mission or whatever.

So once you get stuck in it, there is no way to bypass it. If you are careful, you can experience almost all the dialogue a Femshep would see.  All of the characters have a limited number of dialogues, and if you are the wrong sex you eventually exhaust those available to you. If you're the right sex there are a couple more that conclude the romance.  All they really had to do was give you a clear out that wasn't a breakup. The way it is now, there is really no conclusion with her friendship. It's up to you whether you romance her, but it lacks what you get with Thane or Jacob for instance, where your last conversation is fairly conclusive. (I'm with you till the end type of shit)"
masseffect,3dnxfq,izmirtheastarach,4,Fri Jul 17 20:56:39 2015 UTC,"Yep, as everyone else has alluded to - if you don't want her in that way, she doesn't seem to want to know you at all.

By this, I mean that there's many missing strings where Shep should be able to say something (i.e., not romancing Jack, but not causing her to be a total bitch, though I don't exactly remember how that scenario plays out as it currently is). Instead, it's just a lot of Black Red, White Blue, and Grey...Grey options. Also, the fact that Investigate dialogue doesn't exactly link properly, but eeeehhh, what can you do.

If I had to choose between the Novels and the Comics though, the Comics are much more closely story-related to Shepard. Mostly all comics are either about a crew member of ME1-ME3 or about important characters we met in game (Aria, etc...).  If you haven't played the DLCs though, I'd recommend doing a trilogy run with the story DLCs of ME2 and ME3 as there's a lot of connections between these.

They may come earlier or later depending on how advanced the various species have become. Javik mentions the previous intelligent race before the Protheans, the Inusannon, peaked around 127,000 years ago (or 77,000 years before the Protheans).  What doesn't make sense to me is how quickly humans went from a sub-FTL race to a galactic power. Maybe not rivaling the council races, but the Prothean archives on Mars were only discovered about 40 years before when the games take place. Even with access to the mass relays and all that tech, it seems hard to imagine we'd all of a sudden have colonies across the galaxy and a second-tier fleet that quickly.  The Citadel Council was formed by the Salarians and Asari in 500 BCE. Turians joined somewhere around 800-900 CE. Batarians gained interstellar capability sometime before 1785 CE. So humans have had far less time to improve their technology... 40 years as opposed to 400+ for the Batarians and thousands for the Turians, Salarians, and Asari.  Yeah, if the Reapers came today and left us behind, they'd get bitch-slapped pretty hard if they waited too long to come back. I guess that's why they attacked when they did in the game - they saw humanity advancing as quickly as they did and decided they'd better get a move on."

(The protheans weren't sure how the asari, having the tech built into their society might put them at risk.) That's why the relay was buried in pluto; any reaper forces attempting to use the relay 'just to double check' would be shot through pluto, because the mass relay would be unable to receive.

masseffect,3dngu3,nkorslund,9,Fri Jul 17 23:06:55 2015 UTC,"Some points to consider:   Even Reapers cannot search every planet in the galaxy. They will for the most part focus on civilizations known to the Citadel races. In fact that's (presumably) the main reason the Citadel even exists - to passively gather intel while the Reapers are sleeping. By a literal interpretation of the Reaper mission, a civilization is only a threat if it is likely to develop AI before the next cycle. However, an AI without FTL space flight is pretty harmless, so the ability to develop space flight is probably used as the true condition. And when you reach FTL-levels of advancement, developing AI is probably inevitable anyway. (In-game events seem to suggest this too.) The relay network exists as a spider's web to pick up anyone who happen to discover FTL. They'll quickly find the closest relay and get folded into the Citadel system. And at the same time unwittingly sign their own death sentence. As others have noted, there is no ""50,000 year cycle"" - the cycle is triggered when conditions are met. 50,000 years is just (approximately) the time since the last (Protean) cycle. It's also likely that the Proteans managed to greatly postpone the current cycle by meddling with the Citadel codes - the mere existence of the Geth 200 years ago should have been more than enough to trigger the cycle. Sovereign had probably already been active for some time at that point, trying to find a way to bring the system back online."
masseffect,3dngu3,krabbby,7,Sat Jul 18 00:10:51 2015 UTC,"Adding onto your first point, it's interesting that there are probably civilizations developing in systems that are not near a mass relay, completely independently of the cycle."

masseffect,3dngu3,meshaber,6,Sat Jul 18 02:05:47 2015 UTC,The sensible thing to do is harvest any civilization advanced enough to notice you harvest the others.

masseffect,3dngu3,vegabondgamer,3,Sat Jul 18 15:54:21 2015 UTC,"I think it's the species that find, travel to, and inhabit the Citadel and build a galactic empire based on the methods devised by the Reapers is what identifies the species to be harvested.  Based on the data the Citadel Races divulge to the Catalyst this is then the information given to the Reapers for determining which species to harvest.  Also all scanned and profiled ships passing through a mass relay is a good indicator of which civilizations meet harvesting standards.  Of course in every cycle there may be stray civilizations.  I would think they are found and dealt with as deemed a threat to the reapers plan."
masseffect,3dnoxn,trex_jesus,23,Fri Jul 17 19:24:14 2015 UTC,"Do you mean the Galactic Empire as it was portrayed in the Star Wars movies?  Or does Imperial Alliance refer to some other political entity in the Star Wars universe?  Well here's my answer if you mean the Galactic Empire:  I think the Empire would win.  Assuming they aren't limited to using relays for faster than light travel, they have a serious advantage over the Reapers in terms of speed.  This is probably the biggest factor.  The Reapers needed to use the relays to travel quickly throughout the galaxy.  The Empire's ships could go anywhere in the galaxy, not just on the routes created by the relays. Reliance on the relays was a major hindrance to the civilizations in Mass Effect, and played right into the Reapers hands.  Without that advantage, the Reapers face a much stiffer resistance.  In fact, if they invaded a galaxy that wasn't prepared for their coming with the existence of a Citadel and relays, the Reapers are pretty vulnerable to any space faring civilization.   The Death Star could quite easily destroy Reapers,  and I imagine a star destroyer could put up a pretty good fight for one.  The entire star fleet could go toe to toe with the Reapers and have  a fair shot at victory. Now, indoctrination might be a problem for the Empire, but I think the Sith would be good at dealing with potentially traitorous underlings and be canny to the effects of mind control and whatnot."
masseffect,3dnoxn,jmw6572,16,Fri Jul 17 19:59:59 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the GE lost a planetbuster and went ""Eh, we'll build a new one"".  Mass Effect isn't exactly hard sci-fi but Star Wars is fantasy in space, and it's hard to compete with their weapon shaped magic tech, as well as their magic.  The one advantage the reapers will have is probably range, but unless this is massively different in the EU that should be an enormous advantage."

masseffect,3dnoxn,rightyguitarist,5,Mon Jul 20 01:39:24 2015 UTC,"I feel as though the imperial alliance could refer to the period after the galactic empire fell, where the imperials fell back and secured smaller territories on the edges of space. But if we're talking galactic empire, it would hardly even be a contest. Let's forgo the lightspeed argument and assume that both sides could travel at the same speed, at will. And let's not talk about the death star. An imperial (imperium) super star destroyer (like the ones you see, at, say, the Battle for Hoth) is about the size of a standard reaper, or slightly larger. This is discounting their smaller ships, which are a bit larger than a dreadnaught, and their larger ships, which can be 5 or more times bigger than the aforementioned super star destroyer. I don't know exactly how large the imperial fleet ever was, or the exact fleet composition, but I have to assume that a not-insignificant portion of their fleets are made up of these ships, because of how many we see. They would certainly have the advantage in numbers and firepower.  But what about population? Downside: managing to harvest even a single backwater planet would probably give the reapers enough troops to take their conquests to the next several. Upsides: This is a galactic civilization that has been spacefaring for tens of thousands of years and sees fighting regularly, in the form of unruly wildlife, civil wars, slavers, criminals, etc. The population would be pretty hardy. Also, each planet would take a long time to harvest. Which brings me to...  Time. The insane amount of time that it would take for reapers to hit every one of the thousands of inhabited systems in the galaxy, even if they could beat imperial starships at the same rate as alliance dreadnaughts, and even if they could harvest each at the same pace as, say, the batarian homeworld (a few months) means that they wouldn't just be fighting one war, they'd be fighting about a dozen, over a period of hundreds of years, from every side. There's a large portion of the galaxy that's still unexplored by the republic/empire, remember, that they'd need to wipe out as well. Without a way to replenish their own numbers, in force, there's just no way it'd be possible conventionally. This would change if you introduced mass relays, but honestly, I don't think by that much. By knowing where to concentrate forces, the imperials could easily push back a reaper offensive, it'd just be a matter of time.  I think you're right in that subtle indoctrination or perhaps a robotic uprising would be the most likely ways to subdue the population. The lives of millions are really ultimately dependent on a few key individuals in many cases, and the citizens of the galaxy are insanely dependent on automatic systems for everything from farming to repairs."
masseffect,3dnoxn,TheInvaderZim,4,Fri Jul 17 20:28:03 2015 UTC,"I thought about saying something about population.  The Mass Effect Milky Way only had a few space faring civilizations.  The Star Wars galaxy has thousands, if not millions.  This partly means more fodder for the Reapers, but also far more resistance, and resistance for a far longer period of time.  I think you are spot on about the amount of time it would take the reapers to subdue the Star Wars galaxy."
masseffect,3dnoxn,jmw6572,3,Fri Jul 17 20:36:11 2015 UTC,"You're assuming the reapers wouldn't start incorporating SW tech with their own though.

And would be good at it because, again, indoctrination."

masseffect,3dnoxn,RogueWedge,8,Sat Jul 18 10:37:49 2015 UTC,"I would say that the Empire wins. We have to remember that in the ME universe, even the most advanced military technology is utter shit compared to the space magic tech in Star Wars.  For example, even Sovereign-class reapers can be taken down by a small handful of dreadnaughts, which IIRC, tend to have a firepower equivalent to about 40 kilotons of TNT, and are dwarfed by reapers. A standard Imperial Star Destroyer is not only about the same size as the largest of reapers, but a single turbolaser shot from it has equivalent to several GIGATONS of TNT (in other words, a single shot from a Star Destroyer is equivalent to the combined force of an entire fleet of ships in ME). Each Star Destroyer also has 200+ turbolasers. Now imagine a whole fleet, with dozens of capital ships, hundreds of support ships, and thousands of fighter craft. The reapers wouldn't stand a chance.  There's also the matter of transportation. Reapers, just like everyone else in the ME universe, require the Mass Relays to reach FTL speeds. Even the smallest of ships in Star Wars can reach FTL on its own. The empire would be able to move much faster than the reapers, and if they destroyed the relays, the reapers would be trapped in whatever system they were in.  On the ground, the reapers would probably be totally screwed, too. Aside from the Harvesters, reaper ground forces pretty much entirely infantry. They wouldn't really be able to do anything to some of the larger tanks like AT-ATs unless they called in a reaper. In terms of weaponry, like capital ship weapons, SW blasters are considerably more powerful than their ME counterparts. I feel like even heavy reaper infantry like brutes, banshees, and harvesters would be torn to shreds by a small Stormtrooper squad.  The only real advantage the reapers would have is indoctrination. That being said, it would probably be almost impossible to have any long term indoctrinations (like Saren) because of how low of a tolerance the Empire has for screwups (Didn't make my coffee the way asked? Lemme choke you to death from the other side of the ship). There's also the fact that many people (and in some cases, entire species) in the SW universe are immune to mind control."
masseffect,3dnoxn,VonShnitzel,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:59:56 2015 UTC,"Maybe EU material is significantly different from what I've seen, but I feel like any fleet to fleet action that ever happens in SW is done at a distance of at most a kilometer or ten, and their projectiles move slowly enough (and are bright enough) that at a larger distance the reapers should be able to just... dodge. Reapers can fire at distances of thousands of kilometers and connect within a second, I feel like they might be able to win with hit and run tactics and a lot of reverse engineering (one indoctrinated non-military engineer on some colony planet is all they need to start catching up technologically)."
masseffect,3dnoxn,meshaber,5,Sat Jul 18 00:45:34 2015 UTC,"I can't say with any absolute certainty, but I'll say this: I'd pay a few pretty pennies to see that fight go down."
masseffect,3dnoxn,Michael_Darkaito_,3,Sat Jul 18 00:02:25 2015 UTC,"Check out r/whowouldwin . They do stuff like this all the time. Also, it's pretty much agreed upon there that Mass Effect's realism makes it a lot weaker than most Sci Fi universes, so the Reapers would probably lose. EU Star Destroyers are fucking huge and just one or two can wipe a planet of life with continuous bombardment- and that's not even the biggest guns in Star Wars."
masseffect,3dnoxn,Parysian,2,Sat Jul 18 03:46:56 2015 UTC,"As others have mentioned, Mass Effect loses almost all of these sort of battles due to the more semi-realistic designs in the game. Most other sci-fi tends to use mostly made up stats, which tend to make them drastically overpowered.   For example, as someone else mentioned, Starwars turbolasers apparently have a 200 gigaton yield (best I could find through googling), while in Warhammer 40k, some ships apparently have weapons weapons with yields of petatons (1 petaton is 106 gigatons).  Given that the Mass Effect wiki puts the Soveriegn class reaper's main gun at a max yield of 450 kilotons, means that a starwars turbo laser hits with 444444 times more strength. Simply put, most other sci-fi universes would absolutly destroy everything in Mass Effect with ease."

Palpatine's original Galactic Empire, with hyperspace capability, it's Death Stars, fleets of ISD's and SSD's, as well as its massive force of ground troops, I have no doubt that the Empire would put up a serious fight against the reapers and probably crush them in the end.   The Imperial Remnant however, would most likely only be able to hold them off for a short period of time before falling due to lack of resources and equipment, although they would have a much smaller amount of territory to defend than the truly Galactic Empire, so they might be able to force a standstill for a time.       A similar conflict was presented in the New Jedi Order series, an extragalactic force invaded the galaxy and was seemingly unbeatable. It took the combined forces of the entire galaxy to turn the tide against the invaders, and still at insanely high costs. Strikingly similar to the war against the Reapers in Mass Effect."

masseffect,3dnoxn,emPtysp4ce,-3,Sat Jul 18 02:23:44 2015 UTC,Empire would be crushed not enough fire power except for a one shot with the death star.  Now if the sith knew how to use the force to destroy mass effect power regulators on the north tower.  Then perhaps they could implode the reapers.  But there are simply too many reapers.  It's a numbers game and no Thermopylae pass in space.  Ion cannons would have no effect on Reapers (due to kinetic barriers) and Star Destroyers are weak when hit with Ion cannons.  Star wars shields are not good enough to be even close to kinetic barriers.  As you know the sith can't put up kinetic barriers nor can storm troopers.  Starwars just has armor that is ruined with blaster fire.  Mass Effect troops have barriers and shields and armor so I tip the hat to Mass Effect and biotics making Jedi and sith look like Amateurs.

The Cycle continues.   Reapers could only be defeated in large numbers if they were invested in harvesting a planet.  Death Star guns in space can only target one ship at a time.  This allowing Reapers to land on the Death star and physically harvest all SSD's and Death Stars.  Storm Troopers will become Husks as the harvesting continues this compromising the Empires fleet from the outside and from with in.

ESRB ratings are so much more meaningless than those in other industries, and even those are pretty meaningless to begin with. It's not like any teen has ever been stopped from playing a game like this.  By the by, the content warnings for all three games are: Blood, Drug Reference, Sexual Content, Strong Language, Violence. I would imagine all of that is taken into account for the rating."
masseffect,3dmdzm,izmirtheastarach,1 point,Fri Jul 17 13:27:15 2015 UTC,I think what OP is saying is that the content that is already in the games does not deserve an M rating.

As to the idea that it did not deserve a particular rating, the ESRB is a joke, just as the MPAA is for movies. They are often entirely arbitrary rulings from a board of idiots. There is no consistency to their rulings, nor has there ever been. Not much point in complaining about that, since it's not changing anytime soon."
masseffect,3dmdzm,izmirtheastarach,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:53:35 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the ratings don't really effect anything. I don't really care, never stopped me from playing a game I ""wasn't supposed to""."

masseffect,3dmdzm,izmirtheastarach,5,Fri Jul 17 20:59:06 2015 UTC,"The sex scenes in all the games would probably have gotten a PG-13 rating if the MPAA was doing the rating. Violence in 1 probably would have gotten PG-13 as well, but with the gibbing in 2 and 3 that would have probably pushed them up to R. The language is tame enough to be worth only PG-13 since the MPAA counts the number of ""fucks"" used in dialog and there are only a couple used throughout the series. EDIT: Forgot about all of Jack's dialog... oops!  There is the issue that the MPAA has a double standard for gay romance (even just implied, like two shirtless men in a bed). So 3 would have probably gotten an R rating for that, as unfair as it is.  Video games definitely seem to be rated more strictly than movies. I mean look at movies like Wolf of Wall Street or Fifty Shades of Grey, they got R ratings as well and show a large amount of explicit nudity. Far more than anything from Mass Effect.  The thing about ESRB ratings is they're completely voluntary - there is no law preventing anyone from buying any game based on its rating. Retail stores will have policies of not selling M-rated games to kids, but there's nothing preventing a kid from buying it online or getting an adult to buy it for him. It's the responsibility of the parents to know how to interpret the ratings in order to know what games their kids should be allowed to play. I'd sooner let my children play Mass Effect than Call of Duty."

I think the romance scenes are important. Partly they're in the game for sex appeal but they also convey something about Shepard's relationship with their love interest, more than can be done through dialog alone. And they're tame compared with what you see in most R-rated movies."
masseffect,3dmdzm,itsamamaluigi,9,Fri Jul 17 14:54:26 2015 UTC,"Not OP, but I think he is referring to the random sexualization like shots of Miranda's ass, and I agree.

I also don't buy the ""it's a game"" argument -- I'd consider ME a cinematic game in the sense that it relies on scene composition similar to movies for storytelling, and if someone tried to frame these types of shots in a movie for anything other than comedic value it'd just be ridiculous."

You get a mix of Paragon and Renegade choices pre-selected. Story: Focus on story, the combat is much easier now. You will have dialogue options and choices to choose from. Roleplay: Like ME1 and ME2, the combat is set by the difficulty you choose and you have dialogue options and choices to choose from.   Since you imported an ME2 character, it should automatically go to Roleplay, but you can also check in the Gameplay Settings. The Conversation Mode setting is the one you're especially looking for, if it's Full Decisions, you're in RP or Story mode, if it's No Decisions, you're in Action mode.

If you are in Normandy Shuttle Bay area, check if your CE items and Preorder bonus are there, if they are then Save game and exit to Main Menu then close. Just close Origin, remember just close and not Log Out or Play Offline. Disconnect from the internet. Use the desktop shortcut of Mass Effect 3 to start game, NOT ORIGIN.

EDIT: I believe all you should need is the giveme2entitlements.exe file you mention... it's just a matter of allowing your game to run and load the DLC without an internet connection. You don't need to re-download the entire DLC from an illegitimate source.  Mods if this is not approved discussion please let me know."

Arrival - Magic doesn't really use Y anymore, and Z is right out. It can get way confusing. You could get away with ""may pay any amount of life and sacrifice any number of permanents, then add that much colorless mana to your mana pool"". Is six mana high enough for Channel plus? Maybe, maybe not.  Batarian Commando is really strong. 1 for a 2/1 with no downside is good enough, and the reanimation makes it better. It might work at 2 mana, or as a 1/1, or entering the battlefield tapped.  Leviathan Control is straight-up ridic, and fast mana isn't even in black anymore.  Reaper Indoctrination would be white if it wasn't for the life loss. Could be white-red or white-black, but it's definitely partially white."

I'd have to actually play it to see how well balanced it is but the one critique I have from looking at them is the cards look super weird with no text in the bottom window. Never realized how important flavor text is for those cards.
masseffect,3dj31t,TheInvaderZim,1 point,Fri Jul 17 05:39:58 2015 UTC,"For hybrid cards, you can't treat them as the same thing as normal multi-colour. A red and blue hybrid card should be seen as two different versions of the same card text, so it should be able to exist as either. A blue and red hybrid card can't have haste because blue doesn't have haste and can't have  card draw withoud discarding. It could have prowess, however, because both colours have mono-coloured cards with it. Blue seems to have way too much card-draw and not enough good things to draw E.g bombs. Black is mostly boring with a few OP cards (Dark ritual? Really?). Red seems utterly busted compared even to black and blue (2 power for r with haste and another upside? A lava axe that is one cheaper, instant speed, and that can hit minions?) White seems useless except for Anderson maybe. A lot of filler cards (2/2 for 2 no abilities) Some of the cards feel like they misrepresent the thing or character they portray (Why does Zaeed have double strike? Why does Aria have 1 toughness?) The actual Reapers are repainted Eldrazi, but are also artifact creatures so they are easier ro cheat out without paying their costs."
masseffect,3dj31t,TheInvaderZim,1 point,Fri Jul 17 13:03:21 2015 UTC,"Look at the Lorwyn, Shadowmoor and Ravnica blocks. Hybrid cards can and often do incorporate the characteristics of both colors.  AEthertow is a 3W/U hybrid card with an effect that's firmly a combination of a white effect and a blue effect.  Ashenmoor Gouger is a R/B hybrid creature with just a black characteristic.  And that's all pretty standard for hybrid cards. They're flexible and give you more options."
masseffect,3dj31t,TheInvaderZim,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:39:10 2015 UTC,"Nope. Both white and blue can return things to the top of the library. However, they decided to restrict it to attackers only to fit white better, which doesn't put it out of bounds of blue.  Both red and black use the restriction ""can't block"". These actually work because both colours can do them."
masseffect,3djfy4,seagullfriend,11,Thu Jul 16 19:31:13 2015 UTC,"Hell yeah, i've been kinda upset because it wasn't an option. Maybe in Andromeda it'll happen. Because you know, Dragon Age Inquisition had this whole Iron Bull situation (which was actually pretty damn hilarious.)"

I'd love to get a younger Krogan squadmate in the 300-500s who's trying to prove himself by joining ARKCON or something like this in MEA.

masseffect,3dh33z,sunshineyblues,5,Thu Jul 16 21:47:22 2015 UTC,"My experience was not nearly as hard as yours, I was not abused and my problems didn't deal with my family which are always harder issues, but Mass Effect got me through some really rough times. Right after high school my two best friends and pretty much the only people I hung out with moved very far away for school, and I stayed in my hometown to work, college was not an option at the time. I had never experienced such complete loneliness after they left. I didn't think it would effect me as much as it did, but I lost the two people I cared most about within the same week, and had nothing to fall back on but a shit job and lonely house. That fall Mass Effect released, and I picked it up at launch because I loved the KoToR games. Safe to say, though it might not have been the healthiest way to go about it, the companions in Mass Effect filled the gaps in my lacking social life. My friendship with Garrus especially goes beyond the gaming medium. We will be bros for life, and he was there with me on every mission, and always in that corridor if I needed to talk to, or just see a friendly face. Things eventually got better for me socially, but even hearing 'Uncharted Worlds' or the title music can put me in a horrible melancholy mood and give me some really harrowing nostalgia. I remember playing the shoot off moment on the citadel roof with Garrus for the first time. Even though the troubles I had had ended well before the third game released, everything flooded back. All that heavy loneliness rested on my shoulders again momentarily, to remind me it was not there all the time anymore, and Garrus especially helped me through it. I always let him get that shot. Always. Because that amalgamation of pixels, animations, and voice files has no idea how much comfort he gave me when I was on my last thread, and he deserved to feel greater than he is, shooting that can, because he became greater to me than he was meant to be."

The vast majority of humanity loves you, so don't be afraid to show your true self to people in real life too.  Humanity would miss out if it never got to know you."

masseffect,3di6rd,acemarke,4,Thu Jul 16 13:54:56 2015 UTC,Why is there a huge discussion in the comments regarding whether to refer to Shepard as she/he/you/they?
masseffect,3di6rd,terefor,6,Thu Jul 16 16:35:51 2015 UTC,"Because it's the internet. People get very protective of characters they love. Some people think of Shepard as a ""she"" even though it's just as likely that Shepard is a ""he.""  The author specifically addressed that issue and said that he'll refer to Shepard as ""he"" throughout simply to avoid confusion.  I've seen other writing refer to Shepard as ""they"" and it only sort of works, and can get very confusing at times."

The boot must prevent your foot from moving in any direction except a little bit up or a little bit down - just enough for braking and shifting. But should prevent motion in any other direction. Like the Daytona boots:  https://shop.helimot.com/shopping/shopexd.asp?id=76  Anything less than that and you're kidding yourself. If you can move your foot left/right, it's not as good. I should know, I have titanium parts in my ankle for related reasons. I wish I had a pair of exoskeleton boots back then.  Anyway, even with the best technology things can still go wrong.

In the utility, click the Save Games link in the left menu. You'll see a button appear called ""Copy Mass Effect 1 Save Games"". Click this.

masseffect,3dhjwh,infernal_llamas,11,Thu Jul 16 09:24:13 2015 UTC,"The DLC missions always try to bring something new/different in my opinion. Kasumi's DLC, running around in fancy clothes and playing spy. Leviathan, playing detective and going solo. Arrival, going solo/duo/solo. Citadel, having your entire squad with you. Lair of the Shadow Broker, the driving car gameplay.  Either they have a little something of gameplay different, or they add characters like Javik and Zaeed, which are pretty cool too.  I think this is why we're often most looking forward to those mission for a break of the usual cutscene > combat > custcene > combat > cutscene flow.  Personally, I love doing those DLCs and couldn't imagine Mass Effect without those missions and characters. :)"
masseffect,3dhjwh,Cybeles,7,Thu Jul 16 10:11:23 2015 UTC,"I also think they have much better scenery, and detail."
masseffect,3dhjwh,SammyG94,4,Thu Jul 16 10:17:36 2015 UTC,"This point stood out for me mostly through the Shadow Broker DLC, when you board the ship during the storm, i spent so long just looking into space and admiring the clouds and storms that weren't seen anywhere else in the game, the colours were fantastic."
masseffect,3dhjwh,Cybeles,2,Thu Jul 16 14:42:31 2015 UTC,I did the same thing on kasumi's mission.
masseffect,3dhjwh,NebulaGray88,3,Thu Jul 16 15:23:53 2015 UTC,"Yup... In a generalization of DLCs (and yes, I know there are many examples which this would not be true (like Pinnacle Station)), everything should be stellar, whether it's the characters, the script, the visuals, the music, the meaningful additions to lore and/or gameplay and etc... People wouldn't be throwing money out the window for something that just adds more side quests exactly like the main game, the DLC has to bring something of value to the player.  To me, ME's DLCs are well done considering that there are mentions of things you did in the DLCs in the later games sometimes, even if only through the emails you receive. Bring Down the Sky, you meet up the terrorist in ME3 if you let him go. Kasumi and Zaeed are both usable outside their missions and in ME3. Omega gives you abilities and new guns once its over. Leviathan gives a ton of lore on Reapers.  The ME DLCs aren't just little side missions with no rewards except XP, hence why I'm more inclined to buying them full price or not, they add to my Shep's story. :)"
masseffect,3dhjwh,imuahmanila,16,Thu Jul 16 11:53:53 2015 UTC,"They better be, cos they be charging money for them. If DLC makes you feel that nothing was added to the game but a few levels, they're not worthwhile DLC."

masseffect,3djpve,izmirtheastarach,2,Thu Jul 16 20:51:57 2015 UTC,"Well you could be right. But its just something to theorize about while we wait.  Plus coming from MGS where all the trailers have little things here and there that end up connecting in a puzzle that Kojima feeds to us piece by piece, it could just be a bad habit."
masseffect,3djpve,izmirtheastarach,3,Thu Jul 16 20:57:03 2015 UTC,"It could be, indeed. Take a look at a few of Bioware's early cinematic trailers. The broad strokes are there, but drawing specific conclusions based on them is somewhat pointless."
masseffect,3djpve,izmirtheastarach,2,Thu Jul 16 20:58:17 2015 UTC,"My thoughts are kind of divided on this. We know (theorizing) that there is a special type of relay that allowed the new protagonists to jump between galaxies.   This super relay could have been built by a species on our end of the galaxy who then  traveled through and set up shop in Andromeda to escale the Reapers. Or it was built by a species that originated in Andromeda and whatever they started could have been destroyed by the Reapers so it was decided to not return to the Milky Way.  Through this theorizing, it leads me to believe that either way, Andromeda probably has structures very similar to Mass Relays. But then again in the trailer (yes I know they probably wouldnt show much) it doesnt look like there were such things. Maybe the new ship has super advanced technology that allows it to jump far distances?"
masseffect,3djpve,izmirtheastarach,5,Thu Jul 16 20:49:33 2015 UTC,"This all sounds fine and plausible. There may well be mass relays in Andromeda. The leak also talks about the game taking place in a single dense start cluster, so it's possible that they can use nothing but conventional FTL drives (perhaps even at Reapers speeds)."
masseffect,3djpve,Allanlemos,0,Thu Jul 16 20:57:12 2015 UTC,"Hmmm, I hadn't heard about that but if what you say could be true, then I guess it helps to reign in the theories a little bit."

masseffect,3dhigj,didde_dragon,12,Fri Jul 17 09:52:18 2015 UTC,"Jade Empire is another older Bioware RPG. It was on Xbox (and is compatible with the 360) and PC (and last I checked it was on Steam).   The setting is a rather good pseudo-Asian martial arts one. It gets a bit philosophical at times, but so do some martial arts movies. Combat is realtime (like Mass Effect) rather than turn-based (like KOTOR). All of the signature RP elements exist: choices, romance, etc.   There is also the added bonus of getting your character a threesome if you play the romances right. Just saying."
masseffect,3dhigj,Falcoteer,6,Thu Jul 16 11:44:30 2015 UTC,Upvote for Jade Empire.  You and I may be the only people who have ever played the game.  Ever.  But I still dream that one day it'll get revived into a franchise.
masseffect,3dhigj,completewildcard,5,Thu Jul 16 12:31:57 2015 UTC,everyone's played jade empire.. It's basically just KOTOR set in mystical china.
masseffect,3dhigj,Burnsyde,10,Thu Jul 16 12:44:35 2015 UTC,"One that hasn't been mentioned yet - Alpha Protocol. The story is a lot like James Bond or Metal Gear in terms of modern day military and espionage stuff. You can build your character how you like, putting points into certain talents over others. You can go stealth, run and gun, or a combo.  You also get plenty of dialog options and a branching storyline depending on how you approach certain people. The game can end in very different ways based on your choices - although there are only a few ""primary"" endings, the details and context can change a lot. A big difference in the dialog is you have a time limit; you can't mull over your choices for too long, it forces you to pick something within a few seconds. This makes it harder to play with the help of a guide, but also gives you that thrilling feeling of playing blind, not knowing all the consequences before you make a choice.  There is the possibility of romancing some female characters (you can only play as a male and can only romance females), but it's really scaled back vs. how Mass Effect does it. It's not necessarily easy to do and isn't a major focus of the game.  What I found neat is that, depending on how you play, certain characters can become your allies or enemies, or they may have little or no impact on the story at all.  It's not a perfect game, but it's worth checking out. It was really buggy at release but I had no problems when I played it a couple years ago. Should be available for really cheap. The normal price is $15 but I got it for $5 on a Steam sale.  I guess if I had one criticism of the game, it's that I didn't connect enough with the characters to feel a need to keep playing it after I finished it the first time. I know that it has a branching storyline and tons of different ways things can go based on your choices, but the crazy espionage story isn't as accessible as Mass Effect's save the galaxy thing. In the end, I didn't care enough about anyone to try to play again and make things turn out differently."
masseffect,3dhigj,itsamamaluigi,4,Thu Jul 16 14:03:58 2015 UTC,"+1 for Alpha Protocol. Played it a few months back and I went in knowing only what reviews were saying about it. Turns out it is a great game, with a fantastic story to add. Its a bit more linear than what they advertised about before release (where you can complete an objective any way you want and that would have consequences) but there are quite alot of hard choices and consequences you make in game. Not really close to Mass Effect but its a good mention."
masseffect,3dhigj,agentmalder,14,Thu Jul 16 15:39:53 2015 UTC,"Truthfully, I don't believe there is a game that will give you the same feeling as mass effect. Nothing that is third person sci-fi where you get companions that are almost lifelike. Where you are playing a storyline that seems to be part detective and part action flick. All the while, leading you down a path that is thrilling and scares you from time to time. Showing you also how human and alien the universe is. All the games suggested thus far only give you one or several parts of the game. However none have all of them. I've been looking too so I just waste my time with another series and keep waiting for Andromeda."
masseffect,3dhigj,Reformingsaint,7,Thu Jul 16 13:34:56 2015 UTC,KOTOR is the predecrssor of mass effect so Id say there is at least one game comparable to ME
masseffect,3dhigj,Cosmic-Insect,3,Fri Jul 17 00:05:15 2015 UTC,"I would have to say yes, to a point. Is it the closest I have seen this far, yes without a doubt. Kotor is easily action, strategy, and 3rd person. Has sci-fi and a little exploration with side quests. Powers that can change combat and is often required to beat the game. Character layout is almost the same as mass effect. Romance is limited but still there. The problem is that the characters can seem too mechanic at times along with the storyline. Mass effect had the ""rollar coaster"" type of story at times but allowed more freedom than kotor. The 3rd was the worst when it came to exploration in my opinion."
masseffect,3dhigj,Reformingsaint,1 point,Fri Jul 17 00:32:58 2015 UTC,"Agreed on all points.  I am in no way saying KOTOR is better than ME, far from it, it was the stepping stone that lead to ME thus is ""shittier"" than ME.

masseffect,3dhigj,Cosmic-Insect,1 point,Fri Jul 17 01:59:29 2015 UTC,"Yes, I'll agree that Kotor is a shittier version of me but that's because of it almost being a predicessor or stepping stone as you pointed out.

Such as dungeon layouts. As for DA:I it's uhm, it's actually good has a decent open world, great storyline, and memorable characters as well. I haven't really finished it yet, due being lazy, but i can say it's worth it. As long as you wont spent all your time on doing side quests. They just feel like single player mmo."

As for kotor, makes sure you also play Kotor 2 with the restored content mod. Takes a somewhat different more grey and grittier approach to what you'd expect from star wars but its a great rpg.

Lots of things to discover, reputation system (actually imo one of the best reputaton systems I've seen, as it focuses on 4 things, not just ""good and evil"" but also how ""pure"" your choices are), all that. Not really romances, but you can marry random NPCs of your choice and buy a house (any house that exists in the world) and have a child, invest in shops and shit, and I remember the humor wasn't bad either imo, but that's a mater of taste. No real character customisation I'm afraid, but you can change your hair and clothes and get fat (or athletic). Female option in 2 + 3.

Save after literally every skirmish. I raged so many times after dying since I would have to do a world over. Notably Therum, Luna, and one of the Geth Incursion planets."
masseffect,3dh8m8,TheProdigalOne,3,Thu Jul 16 07:05:03 2015 UTC,This goes without saying in most older games.  Checkpoints usually are very few and far between so the need for quicksaving is paramount.
masseffect,3dh8m8,Nicholas_,4,Thu Jul 16 12:26:24 2015 UTC,"First thing to note, Mass Effect, like most RPGs does not have an overabundance of auto saves. Unlike most modern FPS the game doesn't save your progress every new area. A good habit to get into is to save the game every 10 minutes or after every major fight.   Second, Mass Effect 1 is almost 10 years old now. The combat is quite dated. Compared to Mass Effect 2 and 3 it is clunky. Higher difficulty settings make taking down enemies take much longer. I'd recommend lowering the difficulty to the lowest setting to get through the game quickly. Many players do this in ME1.  Lastly, stick with it. The story is amazing and the characters are great. The combat significantly improves in 2 and 3 so just enjoy the story and fly through the combat on easy mode."
masseffect,3dh8m8,swiftwings88,4,Thu Jul 16 12:55:55 2015 UTC,"You just have to remember to save here and there, same as any other classic RPG.  As for combat, use the radar and the power wheel. A lot. They are the basis of the game."
masseffect,3dh8m8,GotACoolName,2,Thu Jul 16 08:53:23 2015 UTC,"Though in ME1 it's a lot easier to just stand in the open and shoot, or camp and wait until they line up like lemmings."
masseffect,3dh8m8,seagullfriend,4,Thu Jul 16 09:06:45 2015 UTC,Yes the system is bad... If you are on PC you can press F6 to quick save outside of combat.

Okay I saw your post below. Squad up with two big guys like ashley and wrex and have them go in front. Stay back and rack up those headshots, use assassination on the bigger enemies. That scene in the beginning with the colossus is a bitch. Just hide behind the crate on the left and kill all the other enemies, then pop out and shoot him in between his death lasers."
masseffect,3dh8m8,RowanFaolchu,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:33:26 2015 UTC,"Ok, thanks for the tips.   Also, as for headshots, is it normal that the sniper rifle aim is ""wobbly""? Kinda hard to get clean shots in and I haven't found a way to stabilize the aim."
masseffect,3dh8m8,chevshade,2,Thu Jul 16 15:41:55 2015 UTC,"Yes, the scope looks like a drunk sailor is holding it. That will improve with every point you put in sniper rifles.   What will help in the mean time is scoping and then giving it a second, it will stabilize after about 3 wobbles, and using assassination which will lock it in instantly.  Infiltrator is a really fun class but you have to accept that you are in the back, and it gets MUCH better in the 2nd and 3rd when they give you a cloak."

masseffect,3dh8m8,stylz168,2,Thu Jul 16 15:52:39 2015 UTC,"Yeah they're about as smart as hanar (you'll get that joke later), you just need to babysit them a little and make sure wrex or someone has biotic throw or lift so that when a big guy charges you, you have a plan.

masseffect,3dh8m8,Thedovahkiin090105,2,Thu Jul 16 15:59:12 2015 UTC,"ME2/3 is similar, but the combat itself is different. You still have two guys and you can boss them around or tell them to use their powers freely, except that now you have global cooldowns. So using one power makes ALL the other ones unusable for the cooldown, so it behooves you to have one or two powers leveled up further instead of lots of powers so that you can spam. They also make each class it's own thing, so your infiltrator isn't just a half soldier half engineer anymore, you're specialized for stealth and high damage shots.  As for telling guys to get to cover, if you're on PC I believe the buttons are Q and E to direct them to go somewhere (I could be mistaken, I started out on xbox). Whatever makes the upside down blue pyramid on the floor. If you tell them to ""go"" to a wall they will stick to it and use it for cover. If they start to get derpy about it just tell them again and they will usually figure out what you want.  I like to put them in cover in front of where I'm hiding in cover so that they wont die but all the enemies will shoot at them. Also give them lots of levels in fitness for the HP."

Why can't we fight off the biggest baddest Reaper in existence to end ME3 while protecting the Crucible (of course, changing the Crucible to an actual freaking weapon instead of a choice wheel option)?  Honestly though, Mass Effect is still probably my favorite video game series I've played through.

masseffect,3djcn8,didde_dragon,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:09:24 2015 UTC,"Sure, unhappy endings can be great. I'm a fan of Spec Ops: The Line as well, and that ending was depressing as shit, but still amazing. But Mass Effect trains you over the course of three games to expect an epic, heroic victory against all odds because you've pulled out so many already, like against Saren, against Sovereign, against the Collector, stopping the geth and quarian war, stopping the krogan and turian/salarian war, bringing down that other reaper on Rannoch, etc., and besides, all those other ones have been in service of this one, so I would expect a way for Shepard to at least pull a non-Pyrrhic victory out of all of it.  I thought a bit more and decided that the best ending I could think of would be one in which the Crucible kills the Reapers, kills a lot, if not most, of the other beings in the galaxy (organic and synthetic, humans, asari, quarians, geth, etc.), but leaves some survivors, notably the Normandy, and most importantly, leaves the mass relays intact. Then Shepard and squad would have their reunion, and the general sense would be that the galaxy had been mostly destroyed, but could now safely rebuild, free of the Reaper threat. There would be sadness, but there would also be hope. Of course you'd have to control for all the other choices people might have made that would affect things, but at least for the Paragon path that I took, that's what I felt like should have happened, and what the game was training me to expect."
masseffect,3djcn8,NebulaGray88,2,Thu Jul 16 22:13:14 2015 UTC,"Okay, but that doesn't make it any better of an ending. It's not like this is fiction or anything, right? Not like they could have made it possible for that sort of thing to happen, huh? Not like you could take some creative liberties to make an ending that maybe bends the rules a little bit, but doesn't just leave you with a bad taste in your mouth and feeling like you spent the last three games screaming into a vacuum?"

The fact that the game takes place in an entirely new setting is an opportunity for them to craft an entirely new cast of characters, unfettered by previous games.

We can expect to make strong connections with our new teammates, just like we did in ME2 when there was mostly a new cast and completely new feel to the game. I think, unless they just completely mail it in, it's going to be a great game."
masseffect,3djyrv,FR33Z1NG,-4,Thu Jul 16 22:04:29 2015 UTC,"""It's a Bioware game"" hasn't done it for me for a loooong time.    What tough decision did we get in ME3 ? Saving the Quarian or the Geths ? Most of us had the perfect ending unlocked. Curing the genophage ? Most of us had Wrex so it was not a hard choice...     Seriously I can't manage to find anything to be exited about this game, and Bioware last games (DA2, ME3 and DA:I) do not help trust them."
masseffect,3djyrv,izmirtheastarach,3,Thu Jul 16 22:12:25 2015 UTC,"ME2 was a great game, ME3 was a great game minus the ending. DA2 was different from DA:O, but I don't think it was a terrible game. Haven't played DA:I myself. If you don't like any of the games I listed, then I guess it's fair to say you probably won't like this game. However, it's going to be on a new game engine, so it's probably going to be pretty different gameplay wise and hopefully retain the core aspects of the Mass Effect series."
masseffect,3djyrv,ArtOfFailure,-3,Thu Jul 16 22:40:21 2015 UTC,"To me ME2 is the best game ever made, ME3 was a complete wreck, DA2 was such a wasted potential it did so many good things just to fall short each time and DA:I was... uninspiring."

If not, then you will know not to purchase it."
masseffect,3djyrv,Benassiesto,2,Thu Jul 16 22:50:30 2015 UTC,"We still have very, very little detail to go on in regards to where this game sits in relation to the wider Mass Effect franchise. So if the existing trilogy is your benchmark, we simply don't know how it will compare. We're a long way off, and we're still feeding off scraps. We don't know much more than they intend to distance this game from that trilogy in terms of location, possibly also time, and the general narrative focus (being built around exploration).  Personally, I think that's exciting. They've built up a huge amount of detail to draw from, but they want to apply it in a completely new way. That's something I really want to see, but, that's just me - I recognise that it is also unpredictable, and it's fair to feel apprehensive about that.  Basically, don't feel guilty for not jumping aboard the hype train. None of us really know where that train is going."

DAI is a good example of what to look for in the new game, and DAI was fantastic.     Did we play the same game ? A game with less dialogue options in its entirety that what was available in one Origin + Ostagar ? A game that, once again, brushed off any of your previous choices in the first two games ? How exactly was it fantastic ? If DA:I is the image of things to come then I don't want it, an extremely few number of sidequests with no dialogue, facebook-like quests, a very few amount of dialogue with your companions and no direct concequences for your choices except a few flavor dialogue.    edit : about the ""it's a bioware game"" you realize that it's just a name that EA uses for a shitload of studios that have nothing to do with the original studio except for a handful of people right ?"

This information is pretty easy to obtain, so unless someone has rewritten the historical news articles, I'm quite certain that's correct.  Either way, I'm having trouble sympathizing with you past your initial post. If you just want to argue about EA, this really isn't the place for it.

I didn't like it, it had lots of issues, but I still think its an OK game in comparison to the masses. Dragon Age Inquisition on the other hand was a fantastic game. I got ~100 hours of content in a single play through. I enjoyed it just as much as the first game. Not sure what you are talking about with the dialogue. Shit loads of choices and shit loads of dialogue.  It sounds to me like you are a bit of a blind EA/BioWare hater, and not much anyone here can do will convince you to be excited for the new game."

The only other game where Bioware focused mostly on this is ME2 and both these games are fantastic. The amount of variation possible in a DA2 playthrough (not on the events of the game but on how your party reacts to them) is incredible. DA2 did not annoy me because of what it was but because of what it could have been, as you said it was better than most games that came out but when I play a Bioware game I'm not expecting ""better than most games"" I'm expecting a game that will be legendary in quality. What I hated about DA2 was that the idea of the game was fantastic and it was completely wasted, and giving Bioware only a year and a half to make it did not help.     I don't hate Bioware, far from it, I spent around 2500 euros on Bioware games and products, but when I look at Mass Effect 1 and 2 or DA:O and then at DA2, ME3 and DA:I there is a huge shift, it's like they got tired of doing what they are best at : dialogue and characters. That's what I'm worried about, I don't want another DA:I in space, I want a game where I can fully immerse myself with no autodialogue, where the fighting is just a way to cut between awesome dialogues.    I don't know if what I'm writing made any sense I'm a bit tired and not good at english."

Using the Suicide Mission cheat sheet to figure out how to set myself up for minimum survivours that could then be killed off in ME3 was really wierd.  I'm also doing a random playthrough with dice making the decisions  (been on an extended break from that though) and that forces you to come to rerms with a lot of tragedy.

When I first started playing when ME1 came out, I told myself I would play it the way I would if it was actually me in the game. Turned out I ended up naturally answering everything Paragon. When I switched over to renegade, sure some of the ME2 interrupts were awesome, but it mostly felt forced and awkward. I was the reverse of you where I felt I would only be selecting Renegade options for lols or out of curiosity. In all, I feel pure Paragon shep represents me as a person much better than a Paragade or Renegade."
masseffect,3ddrq1,ArthurCyning,2,Wed Jul 15 23:28:57 2015 UTC,"When they give me the option to save everyone, I will do it. The Mass Effect series, as silly as it sounds, doesn't have enough difficult choices. After a full play through the toughest choice I ever had to make was who to leave on Virmire as I love both Kaiden and Ashley, after that I don't remember any other particularly difficult choices. It was a paragon play through so whenever the choice was 'kill random antagonist' vs 'save everyone' or 'shoot annoying fan' vs 'dissuade annoying fan' I always went for the sensible choice. I never particularly cared for many of the ME2 characters but I was never forced to choose between them and I don't remember any difficult choice in the third game either. The series doesn't live up to the tone that Virmire sets and forcing yourself to make the wrong decision, in order to get more satisfaction out of dialogue, takes away from the legitimacy of the games choices. I hope the Andromeda trilogy has more meaningful decisions rather than just good vs bad. Garrus's story arc involves him seeing through the black and white world he fashioned for himself, and him coming to terms with the various shades of grey, it is unfortunate that the player doesn't come across this theme nearly as much."

They carry a lot more weight when they're unexpected. Unfortunately there's no way of going back to a point before you knew how it all worked! Playing the games ""organically"" without the help of a guide or any prior knowledge would be the best.  The only other thing is it would be nice if going all Paragon all the time didn't always result in the best possible outcome. Again, just takes away some of the suspense.

masseffect,3ddrq1,asheneyed,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:59:24 2015 UTC,"My canon Shepard doesn't make anything that could easily be considered a 'mistake' (some stuff turns out to be, but only by comparing playthroughs, and it was reasonable at the time), because she knows what she's doing.   Then she gets pressured into sabotaging the cure (and shooting a good friend/admired colleague in the back) for salarian aid. Then she finds out the Dalatrass got out-espionaged by a krogan, has to kill said krogan/once close friend and ends up losing military strength on the deal. It was a bad day."

This is of course due to the Suicide Mission, while awesome it also wrote Bioware into a corner with the limited time they had to make ME3"
masseffect,3ddrq1,AzertyKeys,1 point,Thu Jul 16 06:22:48 2015 UTC,"While I'm still largely unsatisfied with Priority : London but the whole game itself shines with complex storytelling. And depending on the situation, with some slight adjustment, there were layers upon layers of conversations and replacement scenes.   In my LonelyShep playthrough (where everyone in ME2 died except for Thane, Grunt, Zaeed, Kasumi, Tali and Samara), ME3 became a whole new and different experience. Like at Menae, Liara had an additional conversation where she was worried about Thessia and Shepard promised that she would do everything she can to help. It's strange that for this scene to happen, Garrus need to die."
masseffect,3ddrq1,aoibhealfae,1 point,Thu Jul 16 08:06:42 2015 UTC,"It is not exactly in the playthrough,but I always choose the colonist background because I like to see my Shepard as a scarred guy who saw his family and friends be slaughtered and he could do nothing about it,although I know that this has little influence in the game,I think that it puts more drama and gives the character a better reason for him to do what he does."
masseffect,3ddrq1,Allanlemos,1 point,Thu Jul 16 01:43:04 2015 UTC,"My last playthrough I did I saved as many people as possible. The only major squadmates to die were Kaiden, Mordin, legion, Miranda and Edi. I was planning on doing an opposite run where I kill off everyone I can. Just for a Game of Thrones 'everyone can die at any moment feel' I don't think Liara, James, nor Javik can die though. That's okay, someone needs to survive."
masseffect,3ddrq1,jamgoth,1 point,Thu Jul 16 03:10:36 2015 UTC,"All my Sheps have different levels of fail and success based on what felt right for their personalities and the kind of story I wanted to tell. Apart from punching Kalisah and saving Morinth I don't think there's a single choice at least one of my Sheps hasn't made or a loss at least one hasn't suffered. Not because I think any given story is more ""powerful"" necessarily - I've never really understood this postmodern ""success is boring, pain is art!"" philosophy that underpins so much contemporary storytelling - but because it's a multiple choice game and I'm going to play at least one of each class anyway, why keep playing the same narrative when I can play different ones?  My main in any game is always going to have a great-but-not-perfect playthrough, though. For Shep that means losing Jacob and Zaeed in 2 and Samara, Mordin and Wrex in 3. She's a hypercompetent Spectre living out a power fantasy videogame plot, she's going to get her happy ending and save the universe she loves, but sometimes the people she cares about don't get to join her."

Some of the scenes are brutal, but the writing is great, even better in a few scenes in my opinion. Spoilers: killing Mordin, watching Miranda get shot, and seeing Tali commit suicide are seriously heavy. Also fighting Wrex at the docks on the Citadel was awesome. The renegade choices match the game as a whole better. There is a strong emphasis on loss and sacrifice that doesn't hit you personally very much when doing a paragon run, because pretty much all of your team makes it."

I don't like my Shepard to have super biotic powers or suited up with a high tech omnitool; I'd prefer just an ordinary person forced to deal with extraordinary situations (with the assistance of some extraordinary people). So choosing to play as a Shepard that grew up as a regular soldier, I feel like an even bigger hero knowing I was able to overcome even greater odds.  I should also point out the irony that despite the soldier being a very basic class, it was probably one of the most overpowered classes in ME1."

I'm very anti-confrontational, shy person, enough so that a friend recently called me the ""most politically-correct person he knew"", as in, I never actually get mad or angry enough to threaten people or make them feel threatened. I also have a pretty strong aversion to physical contact with people I'm not intimate with, like someone passing their arm around my neck or grabbing my shoulder that's only a coworker or a friend.  Lore-wise, biotic users are required a huge control over their emotions and should never let anger, fear or revenge drive them to use biotics against civilians and normal everyday-life people.  Most of their powers are generally used to keep enemies away too.  That and something about the sound biotic explosions make makes me all warm and fuzzy inside, and it's pretty to look at. :P  So yeah, I think Adept would reflect my personality."

masseffect,3dg4kp,evilweirdo,1 point,Thu Jul 16 05:00:46 2015 UTC,I don't know if it reflects my own character but the one I identify the most with is the soldier.

For FemShep, I find its more believable for her to be everything else but Soldier class. I think its mostly due to the armor. How can a huge guy like Shepard who could strap all of his weapon on his back, couldn't even wear a heavy armor or if he's a power class, a medium armor too? That kinda ruins the immersion..

And through years of learning self-control, she reserves that temper for the battlefield. Add that to the adrenaline of the battle... and vanguard fits her just right: charging, melee-ing, shotgunning everything she sees just blows off steam like nothing else.  As for me... I'm mostly shy and don't like confrontation, but I do have quite the temper as well (that I have learnt to control over the years). So most likely it would still be either vanguard or adept for me. Because most biotics have had to learn to control their emotions in order to control their power."

Whereas in Skyrim, you can go do 1001 unrelated things that have nothing to do with the main quest at all.

They purposely make the story non-pressing/time sensitive to encourage the player to experience the world in their own way.  The story is arguably the strongest point in the Mass Effect series so I even if we get a vast open galaxy game I highly doubt they will be as lax on the story as Bethesda is with their open world games."

A truly open world isn't really possible with the current scope/vision. It most likely will be a semi open world like Dragon Age Inquisition. You will be able to travel to different planets and visit the surface. Like Mass Effect 1 but than in the Andromeda galaxy and more content on the planets itself."

The reapers are too powerful for one person to control due to there own whims and synthesis is just destroying what makes people, people. the differences, culture, emotions. Destroy comes with a heavy cost but even if ghost space child said destruction would have wiped out the human race I still would have done it."
masseffect,3dexzz,deager,3,Wed Jul 15 23:12:20 2015 UTC,"I guess it's only fair I say my preferred ending: Destroy.  While part of my reasoning for choosing it is selfish because I wanted my Shepard to live (I had a family of asari kids to go back to dammit), the other reason would be that it would be accomplishing what we set out to do since the first game: defeat the Reapers.   Plus seeing the scenes where the Reapers blow up on places like Thessia and Tuchanka and seeing everyone cheer for their victory felt satisfying because it was finally over.  The reapers are too dangerous to even consider Control (imo) and Synthesis may seem like a good idea on paper, but it also removes diversity within the species and would have questionable effects on evolution.  While it may mean losing the Geth and EDI, I'm not willing to take any chances with the Reapers.   Then again, I could just be talking out of my ass with my justifications."
masseffect,3dexzz,vacantstars,3,Thu Jul 16 12:58:33 2015 UTC,"For official endings, it was a hard choice. I went sythesis but then realized, in my mind, I blew it. Yes, I had saved the geth and I viewed EDI as alive...but it was too much space magic and I didn't buy it that everyone would just stop fighting (we're all human and fight all the time right now.) Refuse was my second run as I was sort of annoyed at the game. Then MEHEM. And for fun, I've done them all, including non-EC destroy with high EMS, ""that's more like it,"" control, destroy with EC, and JAM ver A and my current favorite, JAM ver B. If it's jam or mehem then citadel epilogue, otherwise I skip that DLC. After 14 runs, I gotta keep mixing it up. This next one is control...I think, because this Shep will have a god complex. :)"

Before the EC DLC I would choose Control, but even that has since lost its position as my preferred ending.       On subsequent playthroughs I choose Refusal as it reflects Mass Effects themes of victory through sacrifice and is the only ending that properly fits the setting in my opinion. Our cycle might have been defeated and ultimately lost, but it was our actions that allowed the next cycle to defeat the Reapers properly, without Casper the genocidal ghost dictating the terms of victory.      I will never choose the destroy ending, I brought Joker and EDI together, forged peace between the Geth and Quarians, and I don't want Legion's sacrifice to be in vain."

Control was my first choice while playing, but after seeing it, I thought it was too idealistic, too, even with a renegade-leaning Shep (although definitely not as idealistic as synthesis).  Destroy was the only option that didn't end with some magic or machine God fixing everyone's problems, and I liked having some remaining conflict.  My headcannon is indoctrination ending that leads to the destroy ending after Shep breaks through the indoctrination, with no options for control/synthesis, or even a convo with star child, since that was stupid."

Synthesis was just silly I thought somehow altering the DNA of every organic life form in the galaxy without any sentients' consent and then expecting everyone to get along hunky dory. I couldn't even consider it.  Destroy made sense, but the cost was too great. You'd be committing genocide with the Geth, setting back any fundamental progress in synthetic-organic relations. The relays would have been wrecked, perhaps permanently, and that could lead to the destruction of individual civilizations as well as the greater galactic community. In addition, everything the Reapers had catalogued would have been destroyed.  Control made more sense as it more or less preserves everything as is, allowing the galaxy and its denizens to progress naturally without the Reapers. Shepard could also repair much of the way damage done during the war as well as share the catalogued history of cycles past.  Yes there's the issue of Shepard essentially becoming a god, but I'd have faith in a paragon Shep to guard the galaxy, without trying to control it."

Apparently I had enough EMS to save Shephard, I swear I did not know that EMS had a direct impact on the ending.  Still, I'm getting second thoughts. It should have been control.

If Synthesis had been less about manipulating people's bodies and more about illuminating the truth of the situation (a la Prothean Cipher) it would have been cooler.  Actually, I was thinking about this earlier today. If I had written the ending, I'd have replaced the starchild with Vigil/Vigil's Prothean implanter dude. The Crucible would end up being a giant Prothean beacon, not a gun. In a way, that'd bring it all full circle, since the series started with a conflict over the Eden Prime beacon. Destroy would have overloaded the Reapers with information, kind of like a giant DDoS attack. Low EMS would fry the brains of everyone on Earth too (like how it works now). Control would insert Shepard's mind into each Reaper and he could control all of them. Synthesis wouldn't do any weird space-magic with ""robot DNA"" or some silly shit like that. Instead, it would basically show each side what the other side was fighting for, in the same way that the Cipher gave Shepard an (incomplete) understanding of Prothean culture in ME1. Once all parties realized what they were doing to each other, they'd stop fighting and live together in peace.  Now that I ran through that whole idea, it really seems like they should have done that from the beginning. Would have tied things up much more nicely."

I will mourn the loss of EDI and the Geth, but the threat of the Reapers is permanently removed.   The other options are too much of an unknown nature for me to comfortably think they are best for the galaxy.  Control is somewhat justifiable. The Shep-Reapers could do a lot of good in the short term as well as safeguarding from any aggression from the potentially genophage-free Krogan. However whose to say the Shep-AI won't eventually become corrupt from the isolation and just become another starchild?  Synthesis seems to be an enforced Utopia. It's hard to form a concrete impression as there is little evidence. But it does seem like everyone has their personalities overwritten at the least. The thought of the survivors of the war just instantly forgiving all the Reapers for the countless massacres, not to mention having no problems hanging out with Husks (who are the reanimated corpses of their family / friends / comrades) is pretty disturbing."

masseffect,3dexzz,Maximus_Realius,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:33:36 2015 UTC,"I prefer the the Mass Effect Happy Ending Mod and the Citadel Epilogue Mod. This ending only makes sense if you secured all the possible alliances though, which is why I wouldn’t implement it as the standard ending, but its how I choose to play, and I’m extremely happy with it.   In this ending, everything plays out the same until after the Anderson/Illusive Man scene. Then Shepard tells Joker to go without them and passes out. Joker forms a small rescue team with other Alliance ships to save Shepard. Once this happens the Crucible fires and the fleets evac. The Crucible wipes out the Reapers completely and the crew holds a small funeral service for Anderson. Hackett then does his speech about how “we can rebuild” and then the Normandy flies off into the sunset. THE END. The additional scenes added can look a little flimsy though, so some might prefer JAM instead. Anyway, the game then gives an epilogue message and then transitions to the Citadel DLC, which is modified to change dialogue so that it takes place a few years after the ending when the Citadel is mostly rebuilt and back in the Widow System. Shepard and the remaining Normandy crew are on shore leave after being hard at work helping maintain post-war alliances and rebuilding.  With the Leviathan DLC installed, the lore established by the original ending remains intact and is (in essence) repaired by this new ending. Instead of the Crucible becoming the solution to the Reaper problem, the story is instead about an ancient AI that is trapped in circular logic, harvesting civilizations and converting them into Reapers as its own twisted form of ‘preserving’ them. The lack of sense that the Organics vs Synthetics explanation made is given new context. Instead of finding a new solution, you simply put an end to the madness once and for all. Synthetics and organics working together against a common enemy proves that there is a brighter future. The Illusive Man is then, no matter what, wrong in his beliefs about control, and Saren is wrong in his beliefs about synthesis. They make sense as antagonists again, and the game wraps up nice and tidy, with a fun and light hearted exit."

masseffect,3dezc2,James_Easton,4,Wed Jul 15 20:30:33 2015 UTC,"He even looks significantly different, which I attributed to either every other Krogan hiding that part of their head or this being what a primordial krogan looked like."
masseffect,3dezc2,Chiokos,12,Wed Jul 15 20:57:07 2015 UTC,Isn't it just because he's a teenager? I swear I read that the idea is that his plates would connect as he got older; we'd just never seen a krogan kid before.
masseffect,3dezc2,themosquito,2,Wed Jul 15 22:14:30 2015 UTC,Huh. I hadn't thought of that. I'd be interested to see what he looks like in a few centuries

masseffect,3dezc2,Chiokos,3,Fri Jul 17 14:19:04 2015 UTC,"Part of it is that he was engineered by a Krogan, as someone on his loyalty mission puts it ""No outside meddling"" or some such, since the krogan really don't trust outside scientists, for good reason.  Other than that... I dunno. It's not like they do half-breeds in Mass Effect; they follow reasonable understandings of genetics that includes proper understanding of the definition of a species. Asari are the only bump in that, and there's a lot of lore to justify it.  I think it's using a definition of ""Krogan"" that's not the species, but the sort of desirable traits of being a Krogan. We use the word ""Human"" in lots of metaphorical ways like this, including variations like ""Humanity"" and such."

If you were an Earthborn try Spacer or Colonist. Change your class, do the side quests if you didn't in your first playthrough. I'm currently finishing my seventeenth playthrough, I only played as renegade three times. If you romanced someone, romance them again, unless you want someone else now. The only thing I don't change is my LI, Liara every time. Mass Effect is a great trilogy with limitless possibilities. You're the painter, and the games are your masterpiece. All I can say is, play the trilogy and enjoy the journey."
masseffect,3ddppy,MostWantedN7,3,Wed Jul 15 14:03:29 2015 UTC,"I've finished the trilogy 3 times: First I went blind just like you(Paragon BroShep, romanced Liara). For my second playthrough I started over and fixed any mistakes I had made in my first playthrough, also did DLCs and more side quests. The third time I went with a ruthless Renegade FemShep and didn't romance anyone and I was an asshole to almost anyone I saw."
masseffect,3ddppy,JackofSpadesXI,3,Wed Jul 15 14:34:00 2015 UTC,"I'm doing a second playthrough now as well. The first time I played as a mostly paragon femshep (earthborn/war hero/vanguard) who romanced Kaidan. This time I'm going more of a paragade femshep (since I don't think I could ever bring myself to go full renegade) who's a colonist, sole survivor, and sentinel. I also plan on romancing Garrus once I get to the second game. Just switching around stuff like that is giving me a different experience, even if I'm not going for the complete opposite of my first Shepard. How much you want to do differently is really up to you, but I would suggest at least picking a new class."
masseffect,3ddppy,vacantstars,2,Wed Jul 15 14:46:59 2015 UTC,"Paragade is a great way to describe what I'm thinking of doing for this playthrough. Like you, I don't think I could do full renegade.

masseffect,3ddppy,vacantstars,2,Wed Jul 15 17:12:46 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's pretty much what I'm going for with my paragade Shep: doesn't take shit from anyone, but is still nice to her crew and does the right thing at the end of the day (ie, there's no way that I'm going to sabotage the cure for the genophage). She's also way less patient with the Council than my original Shepard was, lol."

I've always played as BroShep though, so want to start up a playthrough as FemShep to see how that goes. Not sure how I'm going to do it though because I always ship Miranda and can't as FemShep. Either way though, play around with different classes/psych/bg and enjoy. My favorite is by far Paragon Adept. Biotics in ME2/3 are INSANE!

For me I'm trying to take the oppposite choices of my first one just to experience all the stuff I missed, plus I'm taking different crew to each mission and obviously different class, background, romance etc. Some decisions you have to make as renegade are pretty tough though, and I made a few exceptions, especially when the other choice didn't make a lot of sense (Morinth).  One decision I regret was to get half the Normandy crew killed in ME2 (not the squadmates). Now my engineering room is boring with a somber Ken and no Gabby"
masseffect,3ddppy,Hydrocoded,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:46:50 2015 UTC,"POTENTIAL MINOR SPOILERS BELOW  Femshep renegade is my favorite. I've played through several dozen times now, probably. I lost count around 15-20. I first played ME1 when it came out, and I've played and replayed all three games almost constantly since they came out. Here's my advice:  1.) You're going to play through again, so don't worry about seeing everything.  2.) Make certain everyone survives ME2. It opens up possibilities in ME3 that are otherwise closed (Quarian/Geth, among others).  3.) Do the Nasanna Dantius quests in ME1  4.) Do the Asari Consort quests in ME1  5.) Visit joker after every mission.  6.) I find that for max difficulty Soldier in ME1, Sentinel/Infiltrator in ME2, then Vanguard/Infiltrator in ME3 provides the least frustrating experience. All classes are possible, but if you want to push the envelope for the first time sticking with those classes will help you immensely. ME2 limits ammo availability much more than ME1 or ME3, which can cause Infiltrator to be annoying, particularly in the beginning.  7.) Be willing to make choices you do not necessarily think are ""right."" This can lead to very pleasant surprises.  8.) Look up guides for Genophage, GQ peace, ME2 ending, romance, and any other quest lines you care about. Get them right the first time.  9.) Finally, if you are sick and tired of planet scanning check out the gibbed save editors. They work, and allow you to avoid the tedious bits while still preserving the game. You can also max out paragon/renegade for ME2 if you want to play it like ME3."
masseffect,3ddppy,samuraichikx,2,Wed Jul 15 18:24:30 2015 UTC,"Going to have to disagree with you on point 6 for ME3.   Solder is laughably easy. My first playthrough was a soldier on insanity and the look on my boyfriend's(sentinel) face while I steamrolled through Priority:Earth was hilarious.  You get the right combination of abilities and you're basically unstoppable. My shield regen by the end made is basically so I only had to duck for cover for a couple of seconds and then I'd be back again.  May be boring for some, but I like it."
masseffect,3ddppy,Hydrocoded,1 point,Thu Jul 16 01:28:40 2015 UTC,"Oh, for certain, but with biotic charge Vanguard can get through the combat more quickly than any other class. Hell, you have to make sure to slow down so that you don't bug spawns out (I'm looking at you, Mars). Infiltrator offers a get-out-of-death-free card which is amazing for new-ish players.  What do you think is the most challenging class, and why?"
masseffect,3ddppy,Toshistation38,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:19:45 2015 UTC,"I always had the hardest time with the Adept class. I actually tried it on my first playthrough and couldn't get passed Eden Prime.  Every class has its own perks. Soldier: ammo, infiltrator: stealth, Vanguard: biotics/soldier endurance, sentinel: tech/biotics. Adept only relies on biotics, and in the beginning I think a dinky little pistol. And to boot, they're incredibly squishy. I wasn't a terribly good shot when ME1 came out so when I ran out of ammo and all biotics were on cooldown, I was dead in the water."

masseffect,3dcq6j,ElectronicFerret,8,Wed Jul 15 07:17:26 2015 UTC,"Femshep here, and Liara all the way. Intelligent, inquisitive, eventually develops confidence and a surprisingly witty and dry sense of humour. I would be all up in that business.  You'll notice that in the first game, Liara is the one to approach you in the cabin -- and if you stick with her through ME2, in the third game she tells Shepard she loves them first (which doesn't happen otherwise). I love that she is actually hiding a lot of self-confidence under the oh-look-the-naive-alien-babe-love-interest exterior.  Plus I'm not gonna lie, the whole melding-nervous-systems thing seems pretty hot."

For us the key words were “career assassin”. The problem was, he was going to be the female love interest. Now that doesn't sound like much if you think about it, but it got us all mixed up a bunch of times, because women were going to have to find this guy attractive. So we asked all the women in the office what they liked in their aliens, and that kind of got us going off a lot of weird directions in the beginning and made it harder than it should have been. As far as men go – like with the Asari – you make her blue and give her the perfect body and you’re good to go. Women are more sophisticated than that.""  Emphasis mine.

masseffect,3d8f7h,bigbeno98,22,Tue Jul 14 10:26:09 2015 UTC,"Tali's romance is so beautiful. To me her romance feels like she thinks she is the ""nerdy"" kid who could never get ""Mr popular"". I love their interactions, especially her confession of ""I've always watched you"""

masseffect,3d8f7h,mutatersalad1,8,Tue Jul 14 16:03:23 2015 UTC,What? What are you talking about? There is no option in which he doesn't die. He has to disseminate himself in the Geth network in order to spread the upgrades so he dies anyway.

This thread spoiled not only Thane and Legion but the top comment sequence has the control ending and Tali's romance spoiled.   When playing a game series that has been out this long, it's on the player themselves to avoid spoilers. Specifically because, despite not being tagged with spoilers, the thread was all about finishing the game. Obviously details of plot will be discussed."

masseffect,3d8f7h,terefor,4,Tue Jul 14 17:05:42 2015 UTC,"The thing that I love about the mass effect trilogy is the characters. Other games will indeed have likable characters and such, but mass effect's characters are so... beautiful. This game can get you so attached to a character if you just talk to them enough. You realize they have their own story, and their own struggle. And you watch the characters evolve in such a way that you see change in them, whether it be they are in love with you, respect you, or hate you. The characters in this game are amazing. Bioware is truly a good creator of characters. I look forward to the next Mass Effect to see what's in store."
masseffect,3dchep,xStrykerJ,3,Wed Jul 15 04:48:48 2015 UTC,"I actually liked the (EC) ending. Not loved, liked.   My main issue is probably that the devs tried to be a bit too clever. Provided you played through the game properly, uniting the galaxy with a high EMS, would have really been so bad if everything turned out great? Normally I'd say no, but this wasn't one game. It was a colossal journey where you formed a serious emotional bond with the characters and the world. You went through serious shit together. I would have loved to see my femshep walk off into the sunset with her LI having blown the reapers into oblivion.    Instead we got Starchild. Ok, again, really not that bad. The choices were interesting and really made you think. I always go destroy, because control is exactly what the reapers want (illusive man much?) and synthesis is actually the most fucked up in the sense that individuality is what defines organic life. By making everyone the same, combining organic and synthetic, you completely eliminate natural variation. If you killed Saren (which you did) then I can't see you justifying it. It's his whole argument, and he's wrong.  Anyway, the only thing that really irked me about the endings was the lack of conversation between Shep and Starpants. There needed to be more discussion before making the choice. My Shep would have argued, said look at what she'd achieved in the game, told Starpants he's wrong. I'd still choose destroy and wipe out geth and edi (it's a war after all, gotta be some losses) but I wanted so badly to give starchild a piece of my mind first. Instead, shep basically gets told the situation and has to react to it.   In a way, walking away and telling starchild to fuck off cause he's wrong would make the most sense from a narrative and thematic standpoint. The belief that the universe would rather go down fighting rather than become anyone's bitch is one of the biggest themes of the series. Unfortunately, if you do that, you lose and it's a horribly cold ending.   Basically, it just needed a bit more work, but it still works. Gets more hate than it should, cause it's really not that bad with EC."

The whole ""synthetics and organics will always fight"" sounds like a cop out and it was proven wrong when the Geth and Quarians made nice and when Legion and I bro'd up for two games. I think Starchild was lying to Shepard, trying to make the Destroy ending sound bad (""Hey, you can kill us, but uh, every other synthetic will die somehow, so don't do that!""), while making the Control (you become a Reaper) and Synthesis (everything becomes a Reaper) sound better.  There a few mobile games, one that focuses on Jacob and Miranda, and another one about a Cerberus dude. Lots of comics. Not much other than that though :/"
masseffect,3dchep,TheFarLeft,3,Thu Jul 16 16:54:36 2015 UTC,"The false problem of consent as a reason not to pick Synthesis eternally annoys me.  I'd like people to be honest and admit that most pick destroy over synthesis because Shepard lives.   Synthetics can be rebuilt ( of course, others than Edi and the Geth) - same can be said of organics. Let the Reapers harvest the cycle, other organics will flourish. And bringing every species one step closer to peaceful immortality is bad because ""lack of consent"" and that is enough, but killing a whole intelligent species and killing a friend is okay ( and Shepard's survival can be greatly attributed to EDI, and not only do  you kill the Geth, you trick them into giving you their support and in the end you give them the short end of the stick). How moral is that?  The mental gymnastics some people make...  You cannot maintain that the Starchild is wrong and peace between synthetics and organics can be maintained and then pick Destroy and kill all synthetics out of fear and self-preservation. You just proven his point.  What Bioware did was present a hard choice: various forms of being for Shepard ( either unaltered or as a totalitarian god ) versus a better existence for everyone, and people picked their unaltered Shepard, because emotions. Bioware demonstrated why the synthetic point of view and criticism towards organics is valid through this huge meta study.  And in return people are annoyed at Bioware because they presented a hard choice with the implication of self-reflection that could potentially say something negative about the player."
masseffect,3dchep,DexiAntoniu,3,Wed Jul 15 12:32:52 2015 UTC,"We simply don't have enough information on what Synthesis is, and why didn't the Reapers do it earlier? The organics weren't ready but Shepard is? But the only thing that goes between cycles is a bit of technology, and Shepard was lucky to get to the beam and have the crucible finished in his cycle."
masseffect,3dchep,terefor,4,Wed Jul 15 15:57:13 2015 UTC,"do you kill the Geth, you trick them into giving you their support and in the end you give them the short end of the stick       It's not tricking them. When you get them to help you, you have no idea about the choice you'll have to make.    While a lot of people chose 'destroy' to keep Shepard alive, there a whole lot of ones that picked it because that was what they fought for. I fought so that every being has a free will and right to exist, develop and flourish. I fought so that everyone can be what they are. By choosing synthesis I'd destroy the most beautiful aspect of the universe - diversity."
masseffect,3dchep,Vocado7,-2,Wed Jul 15 13:27:51 2015 UTC,"How do you destroy diversity?  If I give every child in a playground a red candy, do I destroy diversity in the playground? Do you even hear yourself reasoning?   And even if this particular point would favor you ( it does not, seriously), what about the rest?   I'm not trying to debate you, you already have your mind made and I won't change that. A lack of critical reasoning under emotional appreciation won't be defeated with more reasoning.  I'm just putting into words this way of looking at things so other people's view can be seen.   But seriously, I know you will not, but please take the ending choices as an opportunity to look inward and figure it for yourself what picking Destroy says about you. But look inward with honesty. ME games are great because they really give you opportunities to learn about yourself."
masseffect,3dchep,DexiAntoniu,3,Wed Jul 15 14:37:14 2015 UTC,"First of all, there is nothing wrong in debating even though we've made up our minds. It leads to understanding the way of thinking of other person and improves perception. From what I see, you perceive synthesis as the only good solution and disprove of those who chose differently. In my opinion that is a mistake. None of this solutions is ultimately good and each choice can be backed with a reasonable argumentation. Though I chose destroy I understand that others had good reasons to choose differently. With that said...     How do you destroy diversity?     To quote Cataclyst: 'The chain reaction will combine all organic and synthetic life into a new framework. A new... DNA'. There will be a new DNA for everyone, which means that every trait they had that made them special will be gone. There will be no asari, krogan or human as we know them. I believe that diversity is something that drives progress. Because of different biology everyone have different needs, they use different technology and think in a different way. Combining visions of various races can lead to conclusions nobody else has thought about before.    Truly, it's all about what you believe at core. That's why you as player and Shepard make a choice, that's why we both chose differently. And there's nothing wrong with that. We're all different.     And really, I don't mind seating and thinking what my choices say about me. I'm open minded. While I'm not going to dig into it right now, I can tell that: I sacrificed synthetics including my friend EDI and technology to preserve what I believe is the most important aspect of life. Because I don't think I can change every being without them knowing. For me that is morally wrong. Sacrifice of EDI and Geth is wrong too. But sometimes whatever you choose comes with loses, sometimes there's only gray. And I like the idea of Shepard making such a hard call. But again, it's the way how I see things."

masseffect,3dac65,Name213whatever,3,Wed Jul 15 05:38:16 2015 UTC,"You're touching on a subject that I had to write a paper on last year, so I have a chunk of text. I'll try and touch only the things relevant to your comment.  First of all, it's not so much about autonomy than it is about the unquantifiable value of a life. While not many people would like to admit it, if given an ethical choice between saving a child and an elderly person, most people would save the child. Both people are just as autonomous and sentient as each other, but their lives have understood values, and in this case the child is understood to have a higher value to their life.  With the Quarians and the Geth, while both races are equally sentient and autonomous, the Quarians innately have a higher value to their lives simply by possessing (for lack of a better term) souls. Regardless of whether anyone actually believes in the concept of a soul, there remains a key distinction which defines this soul:   The Geth exist only to grow larger, become more efficient, and improve their likelihood of survival, and everything they do is in furtherance of this goal. The Quarians exist only to grow larger, become more efficient, and improve their likelihood of survival, and everything they do is in furtherance of this goal, however they live under the delusion that they do this to be happy as an individual.   The concept of ""happiness"" and ""individuality"" are completely foreign to a machine because a machine does not need emotional drives to accomplish its larger goals nor does it need to process ""small picture"" ideas when it could easily render ideas in their true size. You could argue that humans too can separate themselves from individuality and meld into part of a collective, but the self-serving instinct which drives that action is inseparable from human--and I can only assume alien--nature.  So to answer your initial question, the answer is yes, but not in the way that you would like. My clone would be just as alive as me (certainly not me me because I'd be dead, but definitely me for all intents and purposes) because it would still be able to understand happiness and individuality, and it would make decisions under the delusion that it is serving both of those areas.  Sorry if I left any holes in my explanation. It's 2:00 AM over here."
masseffect,3dac65,nadil10,8,Wed Jul 15 06:11:29 2015 UTC,"Nah its great, I love that the game provokes these conversations. However there are unexplained actions by Legion that may hint at more than just a machine intelligence. Did you ever ask him why he used Shepard's armor specifically to repair himself? Also, what about the scene in the Geth server where he shows the Quarian that sacrificed himself (herself? Can't remember) to try and save the Geth? The creators have forgotten but the Geth take care to remember such actions. Most importantly your arguments are based on a definition of life defined by our species, culture, civilization. The Geth could, by another subjective judgement, be more than humanity precisely because of their integrated nature. Either way, between Legion's inexplicable actions or the development of single Geth programs going from advanced VIs to the far more differentiated ""people"" they become with Reaper code upgrades I don't think we can simply call them machines. Are we not just complex machines of hemoglobin and neurons instead of hydraulic fluid and networks?  Edit: spelling since on mobile"
masseffect,3dac65,Name213whatever,2,Wed Jul 15 06:28:17 2015 UTC,"I totally get where you're coming from, and I never meant to imply that the Geth were totally without emotions or drives. I was just arguing that their lives were not as valuable as the Quarians'. And while you can say Quarians are machines as much as the Geth are machines, there remains the fact that the Quarians came first.  While it might seem a little shallow to claim that the Quarians get ""firsties"" so to speak, it really is the crux of the situation. The Geth were created by living creatures and ended up acting like living creatures (at least in the basic capacity that I mentioned in my previous comment). They are the only race which was designed instead of grown, and I think that creates a huge difference between them and the rest of the races.  Because they were designed as VI's by organics to do things that organics do, they were, are, and always will be a mere simulacrum of life. They are forever subordinate to their creators who have every right to be able to claim ownership over the Geth. And ownership also entails the right to destroy your property.  Humans have never had to deal with the ramifications of their property suddenly gaining a mind of its own, but were it to happen, they would feel fully entitled to being able to remove it from this world at will.  In a nutshell, it is the right of the creator to destroy his work should he find it necessary or desirable. The Quarians as a people have every right to destroy the Geth if it means safety for their people, and in the case of the events on Rannoch, it did."
masseffect,3dac65,nadil10,0,Wed Jul 15 06:46:24 2015 UTC,"I guess one of the big contributing factors is that the quarians chose to oppress this race using violence again and again, refusing to consider a diplomatic solution, and threw themselves to their death. If you don't have the requirements to ""save"" them, ultimately their choice truly was their choice. So heartbreaking, especially for the minority like tali and two of the other admirals. I don't think they had any right to destroy, they should have relocated. At that point, the planet was their property but the geth no longer were, not without some illium slave contract deal being sorted."
masseffect,3dac65,bozwizard14,0,Wed Jul 15 20:52:25 2015 UTC,"The fact of the matter is there's no grounds to claim that the geth are less valuable than the Quarians.   They're alive in the same way that organics are. They're conscious, they feel, they desire. There's nothing really different about them other than how they go about doing these things.   I think you're just suffering from a natural sense of likeness with other organics. A sort of broader racism, if you will.   It's actually very arguable that choosing the geth is the only moral way to go, seeing as the Quarians are about 99% responsible for every shitty that's happened to/been done by the geth. They have dug their own graves."

For a while I tried to justify it because the Quarians had definitely made some serious mistakes around the Geth, including the one they were making at that very moment by foolishly attacking them just as the Reapers were starting to attack the entire galaxy.  I exited out of the game and figured I would restart the mission and this time save the Quarians. Ultimately, I actually ended up going back to a much older save and having to redo several other missions, so I could save Admiral Koris, and at that point I was able to reconcile the two (luckily I successfully defended Tali in 2).

She's literally just performing an instinctual biological process which Samara even says is extremely addictive, but it's such a shock that cooping her up makes her even more eager to do it.  And don't get me started on how Samara had not one, not two, but three children. How the heck do you have a single Ardat Yakshi and think, ""you know what? I wanna make two more.""

masseffect,3df8m2,FR33Z1NG,2,Thu Jul 16 21:28:50 2015 UTC,"Destiny had such incredible potential. As a dedicated SP player, I found myself pleasantly surprised to team up with randoms on the fly, but I primarily played the missions alone. I didn't mind that at all, I just wish there had been more depth. Destiny's surface is beautiful, but that's all there is, with a hint of amazing things just out of reach.  That being said, I think the destiny style dropping in and out of multiplayer idea could work well in PARTS of ME:A, but I don't want it to become the whole thing. I think it would be kickass to have the MP portion of the game integrated a bit more than ME3 by taking the war room idea (or DA:I's war table) a step further, but I want my SP story to be the focus.   I'd love it if we had a 'war room' style space where we could go to strategically plot broader strokes of the game. You'd see zones calling for different approaches - maybe a settlement is about to be overrun and you need to defend it, so you send in a fireteam and play a horde mode MP match. Perhaps some intel needs to be gathered from an alien site or a high value operative needs rescue, so your MP experience is more of a capture the flag or escort mission style event. Some rebellious colonists are staging an uprising - BAM, team deathmatch. Scouting a new world for resources? BOOM, PVP free-for-all. * Drops Mic *  Maybe also there are certain planets designated as MP areas, where you can go and explore and run into trouble as you will, and where MP develops organically a la Destiny's free-roam modes, with fireteams forming and disbanding willy-nilly.  Mainly I want to access this stuff from inside the single player game. I know in my heart that my ME3 N7 Operatives and my DA:I Agents were all working for the cause, but promoting them and seeing them show up as war assets or sprites at Skyhold didn't do enough to make them feel connected. I also loved reading about all the teams I recruited in ME:3 and sending agents on war table missions in DA:I, but what I really want is to BE those agents, right then and there. Let me choose an operation that needs doing, and then take over the team of agents sent to carry it out.  I feel like this would create a multitude of MP modes that would encourage players to try new classes and promote different agents. To tie it to the main game further, perhaps the number of fire teams you can send out is limited by resources gathered - teams need time to cool off/travel between matches, and you have to spend resources to recruit more agents. Not a pay-to-play scenario, simply a reflection of individual playstyle. SP focused players might have more resources to spend on main game things (ship upgrades, colonies, etc...) initially, but those who invest in MP agents and play more matches have the potential to earn more resources and broaden their influence further. This gets around the ME3 issue of NEEDING to play MP to get the highest EMS (at least early on). This way you can choose how you get to the end, and your choices will matter.  TL;DR:   access MP matches from within the main game's 'war room', not a separate menu. varying styles of MP matches allow for exciting gameplay options and encourages trying multiple classes MP teams need to be invested in to play more - allows in game resource management to matter   Apparently I feel strongly about this..."
masseffect,3df8m2,prudishunicycle,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:00:41 2015 UTC,"These are all great ideas. Though I don't personally think they'll place too much of an integrated multiplayer like that into the game. Simply put, it ruins the pacing of the story (as other people here have said). I think that's also what made the Destiny story so damn hard to comprehend. I spent so much time replaying missions or farming for loot that I completely lost track of the linear progression.  If I have to add anything, as a Destiny/Mass Effect player myself, I would have to say that if they're going to ""improve"" upon Destiny, I would hope that the selection of planets is a lot wider.  We probably don't have anything to worry about, because of the way ME1 was structured, and if anything they're only going to improve upon it since they've taken so much feedback from the fans relating to ""more exploration"", but so help me if the selection of explorable planets is limited.  That's literally my only complaint about Destiny. I was incredibly disappointed to learn that there were only what, 4-5 planets to go to? All within our solar system, with no interstellar exploration at all. Like, seriously?  I'm ranting, but you get my point"

However I do believe the ps3 version of ME 2 comes with all the DLC except for Arrival (At leas the non- trilogy version did)  As for ME 1 and 3 Ur kinda screwed .
masseffect,3daz72,Ryuutakeshi,2,Tue Jul 14 21:47:02 2015 UTC,So irritating. I own the license to use the DLC on one console but not another. Fucking stupid world.

But for PS3/Xbox360 I doubt they would let you have a free copy on theirs because Microsoft and Sony don't like you paying the other one. EA on the other hand doesn't mind because they already got paid."

Then I became a PC gamer and rebought ME3 on Origin. I went to the online chat on EA and the customer service reps were very understanding and helpful. Somehow they managed to transfer the licenses from my 360 to my Origin account. If the online people say no, call them and ask again. I'm not sure if they'd be able to do give you PS3 dlc but it's worth a shot. EA might get a bad rep but their customer service reps are very nice :)"

masseffect,3dci8f,VonShnitzel,9,Wed Jul 15 04:57:06 2015 UTC,"Citadel is arguably the best DLC in the entire series. More of a fun thing than something crucial to the story.  My personal second would be Leviathan because of the backstory it gives. It explains so much about so much, and gives context to the entire story. Missions are pretty decent too.  I never played Omega though, so take that for what it's worth."

Cons- Not much bad to say about it tbh My other one would be Leviathan 8 for gameplay 7 for story Pros: Great backstory, interesting places, Decent length Cons- Doesn't really bring any new combat ideas pretty much more of the same."

One of the best things about the entire franchise.  After that I'm torn between From Ashes or Leviathan. Leviathan adds something unique in terms of backstory and horror-genre stuff, and adds some real depth and intrigue to some of the series' bigger mysteries. From Ashes gives you some really good backstory too, but more importantly than that if you do it early on, it contributes meaningfully to the entire of ME3."

masseffect,3d9a1j,Rebel_Turian,16,Tue Jul 14 14:33:01 2015 UTC,"In the first trilogy, there were three main classes that reflected Combat (Soldier), Tech (Engineer), and Biotic (Adept). To go along with those were the three subclasses that combined two of the main classes: Vanguard (Soldier/Biotic), Sentinel (Tech/Biotic), and Infiltrator (Soldier/Tech).  I would assume that the new series would have a similar system. They might go into the same skill tree system as DA:I, in that there are three primary classes, but each class has multiple sub-specialties with their own skill tree's to chose from. I would assume this to be the case, because I am also assuming that they will be borrowing the war table mechanic from DA:I."
masseffect,3d9a1j,vibraxis,5,Tue Jul 14 15:24:17 2015 UTC,"I really hope they take the lessons from ME3 multiplayer to heart.  There's so much more variation possible with specialist classes like the N7 classes, the Asari commandos and the like."
masseffect,3d9a1j,grogleberry,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:30:18 2015 UTC,"I would like to see more variation though, seeing as it's more about exploration. More passive abilities for the world, rather than choosing basic classes than sub class; to be a close-range or long range fighter (e.g the Rouge in DA:I)  The War Table mechanic (If it gets included, which I hope it does) will probably work the exact same, when exploring worlds, you find suitable camp sites to start growing your influence in Andromeda, and grab resources at the same time, minerals, Eezo etc"

Sending Spectres would also make sense, but they'd be needed to police The milky way, and there's probably fewer of them than N7 agents."

US Army Rangers, for example, are elite high trained troops that lead the way for the regular infantry. Sure N7 are more akin to the SAS or Delta, but in the instance of going in blind to new worlds, with who knows what, a professional makes sense."

Andromeda is 2,5 million light years away - it would take 456.62 years to reach it. Look at the Migrant fleet - they have problems keeping their 300 year old ships running, now add to that, when you past Milky Way there is almost zero possibility for refuel, ship materials, FTL core discharge, the list goes on.

When people say ""based on the lore"", they are usually not referring to gameplay, and certainly not ONLY to gameplay.   You keep trying to argue with people because you are taking only the gameplay into account, which ignores what you are actually told and shown in the game. While you're welcome to discount anything you choose to, you can't really fault other people for choosing not to.  The lore encompasses the codex, the in-game dialogue, what is presented in cut-scenes, and to an extent the other media like books and comics. This is all considered canon.  Gameplay is a thing in and of itself. Much of what occurs is dictated by the game engine and the combat system. Grunt for instance is much taller in his initial cut-scene then he ever appears to be in combat situations. This requires some suspension of disbelief. Similarly, in the  combat system Shepard appears to be the strongest Biotic in the galaxy, but that's really just because he is the player character. In the actual lore of the Mass Effect universe, he is unlikely to be."
masseffect,3d9yp1,izmirtheastarach,9,Tue Jul 14 17:34:41 2015 UTC,"I'd rather have balanced gameplay, then overpowered squadmates just because they are supposedly the best in the universe."
masseffect,3d9yp1,Rebel_Turian,-4,Tue Jul 14 17:55:52 2015 UTC,"I see where your coming from and you explained yourself quite well. Ill say this to you though, the ""lore"" by your definition is very inconsistent.  I'll use the example in the original post, Wrex can die to shepherds pistol on the citadel if certain paths are taken. He dies to a few meager bullets. Shepard on the other hand, a human, cannot even be killed by the most powerful reaper beam? According to your definition of lore shepard is neigh indestructible. Im just saying that's why I think gameplay should be taken into account when discussing the power of the mass effect characters, but like you said your entitled to think what you want."
masseffect,3d9yp1,terefor,5,Tue Jul 14 18:08:49 2015 UTC,"Lore being inconsistent is a valid criticism, but gameplay is in no way lore."
masseffect,3d9yp1,izmirtheastarach,3,Tue Jul 14 18:11:33 2015 UTC,"It's not really MY definition, it's the definition that is used by everyone but you, at least in my experience. You are the first person I've ever seen trying to make this particular argument.  Since I wasn't personally involved in the development of these games, I don't feel any real pressure to defend their inconsistencies. That complaint is more properly directed at the actual developers.  Just to nitpick though, Wrex is killed by Shepard and a couple of C-Sec dudes firing a fair number of bullets into him, and he actually appears to be killed be falling to his death.   I am not saying gameplay should not be taken into account. But you can't take only the gameplay and ignore every other part of the story presented to you. You also have to allow for the fact that technical issues dictate much of what you experience in the gameplay itself. There are many reasons why things work the way they do at the gameplay level."
masseffect,3d9yp1,xeqtioner0,-2,Tue Jul 14 18:14:44 2015 UTC,"I dont take ONLY gameplay into account. In fact i've argued before how Shepards physical feats are underrated (knocking out the krogan, pullups and I guess now the harbinger beam). I just never understood why people never took gameplay into account, seeing as if you literally take no gameplay as lore then 90% of the mass effect events did not happen, I know you take into account gameplay (I actually remember a thread where you said the shadow broker had the best shot of standing up to vanguard shep 1v1) but a lot of people don't consider it at all.   Just to nitpick though, Wrex is killed by Shepard and a couple of C-Sec dudes firing a fair number of bullets into him, and he actually appears to be killed be falling to his death   Renegade option allows Shep to handle it on his own"
masseffect,3d9yp1,xeqtioner0,4,Tue Jul 14 18:28:28 2015 UTC,"I just never understood why people never took gameplay into account, seeing as if you literally take no gameplay as lore then 90% of the mass effect events did not happen.  I'm not sure you are getting the point everybody is stating. Lore=/= gameplay. The locations, people, hallways, etc. everything you explore and all is part of the lore. But the actual gameplay, IE the battles themselves and mechanics are NOT part of the lore. Gameplay is just a means to get from point A to point B of the story. It is not a representation of the story and characters abilities and is not meant to override the lore in any way."
masseffect,3d9yp1,xeqtioner0,-1,Tue Jul 14 18:32:41 2015 UTC,"This is a genuine question. If the battles in mass effect are not lore then what are they? Am I mixing up lore and canon? For example defeating lady benezia, how is that battle not mass effect lore?"
masseffect,3d9yp1,xeqtioner0,5,Tue Jul 14 19:12:17 2015 UTC,"For starters, let's keep canon out of this as that will just open up another can of worms.   Basically, we cannot consider gameplay in the series (or really any game for that matter) to be part of the lore. Lore is basically the background, story, everything in the game universe that explains why things do the things they do. The battles are simply just that, battles. They did happen and are part of Shepard's story. Yes, they are part of the lore, but the GAMEPLAY MECHANICS are not.  So even though my Adept Shepard is stronger in the midst of battle compared to Jack, lore-wise she is a stronger biotic due to the story. Gameplay is not a solid representation of the characters and their abilities because it is simply meant to be there to help the player get from Story A to Story B while having fun."
masseffect,3d9yp1,izmirtheastarach,3,Tue Jul 14 19:25:43 2015 UTC,Very Well explained
masseffect,3d9yp1,TheHoboFish,2,Tue Jul 14 19:27:37 2015 UTC,"Haha I tried to do the best I could.  So are you clear on the difference between lore and gameplay? Gameplay can't (usually) be considered part of the lore because of the fact that it's not supposed to be an actual visual representation of the characters and their abilities. Lore is the universe's rules and regulations that these characters and stories must follow. Gameplay can break those rules because otherwise, you would be killing Krogans in one shot, Jack would be flinging every enemy off screen, etc. Gameplay is simply enhanced for the gamer's enjoyment."
masseffect,3d9yp1,terefor,-1,Tue Jul 14 19:31:50 2015 UTC,Do you think its good for the story to have Jack as a stronger biotic than shep?
masseffect,3d9yp1,aoibhealfae,3,Tue Jul 14 19:32:22 2015 UTC,"Yes, if only for the fact that some people won't play their Shep as a biotic. Shepard was never mentioned to be the best biotic ever, and per Jack's background and history, it works for her to be stronger.   Gameplay-wise, my adept Shep is stronger than Jack. Why? Because otherwise it wouldn't be nearly as fun if it were vice versa."
masseffect,3d9yp1,xeqtioner0,2,Tue Jul 14 19:35:11 2015 UTC,"Considering the amount of effort that went into maxing out her  Biotic potential during her time with Cerberus, it does seem to make sense from a story perspective.

masseffect,3d8a5f,gruedragon,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:10:04 2015 UTC,"I'm confused, is it different for male Shepard when you break up with Liara? Whenever I end it with her and stay with Garrus, she's so relieved. Like, she even sounds excited. I always got the impression she felt like I was letting her off the hook. It made it so much easier to stay with Garrus because I knew there was no bad blood."

But the main plot would be that the wormhole has remained open and in Alternate Universe the reapers are winning hard. And reapers and refugees are occasionally coming through.

My choice was Tali from the moment she threw that grenade at Saren's assassins.  I mean, really, your choices are:     The xenophobic direct subordinate (big no-no!) that managed to get her entire squad killed by some drones The wide-eyed teenage girl (by Asari standards) who gets a hero crush on you the instant you pull her out of the trap that she setup ... and managed to trap herself in The (admittedly, also young) woman that has managed to solo her way across the galaxy, get into enemy territory and out again with critical intel, and when ambushed by assassins immediately tries to fight her way out rather than giving up or crying about it.

masseffect,3d6bid,insan3soldiern,0,Tue Jul 14 17:17:23 2015 UTC,It's a lie that Ashley is telling.  If you pursue the relationship more without involving liara.  Ashley latter on comes clean and tells you her father was the general that betrayed humanity and surrendered to the Turians.  That's why she's lying to you right now in the video about her father being 3rd class.    My shepard took her loss pretty hard and Liara came to the cabin.  Kicked Liara out of the cabin.  After all Shepard was conflicted he let his LI die on Virmire in a nuclear explosion.

You get all the scenes and all the dialog text, but Femshep doesn't actually say anything because JenHale didn't record those lines, but it is easy to hear her voice saying them in your mind.  And it's just as awesome to see FemShep crawl into bed with Tali.  And yes, Hale read the Tali romance lines better than Mark Meer, even though she never read the lines.  (Sorry BroShep fans.  Mark is a great guy, but every line he reads sounds robotic)"

In fact, my first playthrough, I didn't know you could walk around and talk to your squadmates in the Normandy until right before Illos. I always took her and Liara with me on missions because of the balance of Tech and Biotics. I found Tali's suit design and pattern fascinating, and preferred her above all other squadmates for both the visual design and because I have a thing for tech.  After I actually talked to her for the first time, I shipped her and Garrus. Once I started playing ME2, she was just <3 and I just fell apart. god   fucking dAMMIT she's too adorable"

I did the same as you guys, and she didn't make me feel guilty at all, what was is not anymore, this happens, we are still friends, and good ones at that. While Garrus is the always there for you bro, Liara is similarly always looking out for you, in the more elvish way.  While Tali is just love.

masseffect,3d7nxb,PastaFreak26,6,Tue Jul 14 03:52:09 2015 UTC,"Hey man!  Adept is super fun but can definitely be a bit challenging. Fortunately for you, ME3 is probably the best game to be an Adept in because they finally figured out how they wanted the biotics to interact with each other.  Strengths:  -You don't need a gun. Well, mostly. All you really need is to take a lightweight pistol or SMG, and that 200% recharge rate on your powers means that you'll almost always have one ability off cooldown to use, so you can sling a lot of power downrange in a fight.  -Combos = massive damage. A biotic combo is made of two parts: A ""primer"" and a ""detonator"". A primer is any ability that has a duration that affects your enemies. Warp, Pull, Singularity, and Stasis are all primers. (Shockwave can be a primer if you get the Lift upgrade) Detonators are any biotic ability that deals damage. Warp, Shockwave, Throw, and Reave are all detonators. Once your target is primed, throw a detonator and anything within a medium sized area gets exploded.  Weaknesses:  -Squishy. You don't get much health or barrier.  -Cannot CC anything with shields/armor/barrier.  Adepts are a DPS focused class. They excel at putting damage on targets."
masseffect,3d7nxb,ProfessionalGinger,2,Tue Jul 14 04:07:42 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the explanation. Still a bit lost, for story mode, I guess you only have Warp, Pull, Throw, Singularity, Shockwave for Shepard right?  From what I understand from your explanation, the key is to playing with Adepts are their variation with spells? It seems to me like every ability has its way of setting up. So am I wrong to focus on the following three first..?   Warp, Singularity and/or Shockwave, Shockwave and/or Singularity?  I take Warp because it is the most reliable ability I've gotten used to thus far. But if I'm looking for big damage, explosion, etc, am I doing it wrong?"

masseffect,3d7nxb,Darklyte,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:30:06 2015 UTC,"Not at all! If you want a comprehensive list, check out the link from /u/tigojones: http://masseffect.wikia.com/wiki/Power_Combos  In ME3, there are 3 more kinds of explosions, Cryo, Tech, and Fire.  -Cryo explosions can be primed by any ability that applies cold damage or a slow/freeze effect to your enemy, like Cryo Ammo or Cryo Burst. Once primed, it can be detonated by any type of ability that is not duration based (with the exception being Warp). So things like Overload, Throw, and Incinerate can all trigger a Cryo explosion.  -Tech bursts. Tech bursts are electrical based explosions that can be primed from abilities like Overload, Energy Drain, or Disruptor Ammo. Tech bursts can be detonated using any non-duration based ability like Incinerate, Throw, Carnage, or Warp.  -Fire explosions trigger from, you guessed it, fire-based primary abilities like Incendiary Ammo, Incinerate, and Carnage. Like other explosions, it can be triggered by the usual detonators; Overload, Nova, Throw, Warp, etc.  Now, I haven't listed all of them for every type, just some of the most common for each. Happy exploding!"
masseffect,3d7nxb,imuahmanila,2,Tue Jul 14 22:15:33 2015 UTC,"Thanks!  I actually didn't know things could be exploded by skills in other categories (eg, tech burst detonated by biotic skills).  This will also help me with the ME RPG I'm working on!  So thanks again!"
masseffect,3d7nxb,imuahmanila,5,Tue Jul 14 22:38:41 2015 UTC,"The strength of a biotic explosion is the same no matter which power is used as the primer and which is the detonator. (With the exception that some primers can do damage before the detonator hits, but that doesn't change the power of the explosion. For example, if you prime with Warp and detonate with Throw, Warp will do it's own damage and then the biotic explosion damage will occur.)  Adept is my favorite class, and personally I focus on Warp, Pull, and Throw as my main powers. Pull is my go-to primer and Throw is my go-to detonator. Even though they don't do damage directly on their own the way Warp or Reave do, they have the shortest cool downs which means you can keep up an almost constant output of explosions. Near the end of the tree for each power, one of the level up options is Double Pull and Double Throw which means you cast Pull and Throw twice every time you use those powers and you'll have two biotic explosions at once if there are two enemies.  I use Warp as my back up move for when I need some extra damage and for tearing through an enemy's armor and/or barrier. But since it has a longer cool down, which means you have to wait longer before using another ability, I only use it when Pull and Throw can't do the job.  And I'm glad you like Kaidan, not only are he and BroShep adorable together, Kaidan is also the best squadmate for an Adept since you can use his Overload to take out shields (which are an Adept's greatest enemy), but you can also use his Reave to both prime and detonate for your biotics.   Also, don't use Shockwave. It's terrible. Literally it's only use, in my opinion, is for a Vanguard to detonate a biotic explosion at range. Adept has way too many more useful powers to bother with it. Singularity isn't bad, but it's cool down is too long, in my opinion, to be an all purpose power. The only time I'd say it shines is to lay down at a choke point so any unprotected enemy that runs through it will be lifted. Otherwise, you're better of using Pull because I find it's always better to quickly lift one/two enemies and damage the others nearby with an explosion than to lift a group and have to wait longer to be able to detonate an explosion."
masseffect,3d7nxb,cif3141,2,Tue Jul 14 05:06:57 2015 UTC,"So from what I gather, for constant DPS in story mode, you'd want to max out, Throw, Pull and Warp for the most damage. Not only they are on short CD, but they have reliable targeting system and travel relatively fast?  Are there any other biotic skills that you will encounter in story mode? I take it you are advising me to max out the 3 biotic abilities above because you can't go wrong with them?  I'm wondering why is Shockwave bad? It seemed like it's got good damage. Does biotic abilities differ when it comes to multiplayer? For some reason, I personally like Singularity because of aesthetic reasons, and that its got an awesome vacuum effect. I would love to try Warp --> Singularity but Singularity is always slow to proc ._."
masseffect,3d7nxb,imuahmanila,1 point,Tue Jul 14 09:26:05 2015 UTC,"So from what I gather, for constant DPS in story mode, you'd want to max out, Throw, Pull and Warp for the most damage. Not only they are on short CD, but they have reliable targeting system and travel relatively fast?   Yes, exactly. If you're looking to be as effective and efficient as possible, Pull/Throw/Warp is your holy trinity and should be used in 90% of situations.   Are there any other biotic skills that you will encounter in story mode? I take it you are advising me to max out the 3 biotic abilities above because you can't go wrong with them?   The abilities Shepard has on the level up screen are all the abilities he gets for the game. You don't pick up more of them later, with the exception of getting one bonus power once you unlock various ones as options. The biotic bonus powers are Reave, Stasis, Barrier, Slam (DLC), Dark Channel (DLC), Dominate (DLC), Lash (DLC), and Flare (DLC). Reave is basically a modified Warp and Slam and Lash are basically modified versions of Throw, so choosing one on an Adept is redundant. Stasis, Barrier, Dark Channel, Dominate, and Flare can be useful, but they're not as all purpose as the main three. My preference is Flare because it can do decent damage against shields and massive damage otherwise, but it's a last resort sort of thing because of the abysmal cool down (19 seconds at max recharge speed compared to 5 seconds for Warp and around 2 seconds for Pull and Throw). Dark Channel can also be useful since it will jump from enemy to enemy for it's whole duration when one dies. You can potentially get multiple explosion off of it with Throw if timed correctly.   I'm wondering why is Shockwave bad? It seemed like it's got good damage. Does biotic abilities differ when it comes to multiplayer? For some reason, I personally like Singularity because of aesthetic reasons, and that its got an awesome vacuum effect. I would love to try Warp --> Singularity but Singularity is always slow to proc ._.   Shockwave doesn't do damage on it's own, it does damage by knocking enemies into things like Throw. And combined with the fact it has a longer cool down and, most importantly, it doesn't auto aim like the other powers, I just find it to be the least useful. You throw a Shockwave out and it just travels in a straight line and may or may not hit someone. Personally, I'll take short cool downs and reliability over any other possible benefits every time, and really the only benefit is, like Singularity, it can hit multiple targets at once rather than just two max. I mentioned earlier that Shockwave can be a bit useful for a Vanguard earlier, but I dislike Shockwave so much that when I do play Vanguard I always pick Reave as my bonus power so I don't have to bother with it.  You can use Singularity if you want to, it's basically just a Pull that hangs around for a while and can pick up multiple enemies. I just find Pull superior for the sake of efficiency. It'll take you a lot longer to make an explosion by priming with Singularity and detonating with Warp than it will to do it with Pull and Throw."
masseffect,3d7nxb,IkLms,1 point,Tue Jul 14 10:07:14 2015 UTC,"Thanks for explaining. I'm trying to wrap my head around this for a summary. So let me just revise what's been said.  Typically, taking Throw, Pull, Warp will make the adepts more DPS-centric. In a way, was I right to say that Adepts are the mages of the game (without damage specification)? There are two ways to build your Adepts, one is to be a CC machine (think leveling up Singularity, Shockwave and massive CD spells such as flare for crowd damage) and the other as a DPS, single target focused killer (throw, pull, warp, in this case crowd damage comes in the form of biotic explosions, in absence of a mob, you are more DPS focused than you are at AoE damage?).  I have yet to come across Reave, Slam, Dark Channel, Dominate, Lash and Flare. But I spent 200+ getting all DLCs so I should find them soon enough. Will Reave + Lash (later on) be a good replacement for Pull and Throw in terms of efficiency? (Or will they suffer high CD and etc.)  In conclusion though, as an adept, they were designed in two ways, a crowd controller (like Liara) or a DPS-single target centric (I'm guessing Aria or Shepard), right? And also, I notice pull or throw has the added benefit of countering shield targets.."
masseffect,3d7nxb,IkLms,2,Tue Jul 14 11:54:36 2015 UTC,"Talk to Tali (if she's there) and get Energy Drain for another playthrough. Choose it for your bonus power, and you're all set.  With that, you can blast through almost the entire game with Pull, Throw, Warp, and sometimes Singularity. Start NG+ and you'll see what I mean as soon as you get to the main battle with Cannibals on Earth - spamming Pull+Throw kills them faster than they drop/spawn.  For anything with Armor, use Warp and Throw. Both Liara and Javik are helpful for an Adept, and if you can manage it right, Javik's Dark Channel will kill a whole group of low level mooks as fast as you can spam Throw.  Regarding the game overall, it's going to suck because of all the people who are dead/missing. Sorry. At least play the second game..."

masseffect,3d7nxb,SomeKindaJerk,2,Tue Jul 14 10:12:17 2015 UTC,"For what it's worth, I'm pretty confident shockwave is basically worthless. Double Pull upgrade plus double throw gets you double the combo if there are two enemies."

Using Throw feels a bit odd, because it doesn't home in on targets whereas Warp does ._."
masseffect,3d7nxb,itsamamaluigi,2,Wed Jul 15 02:55:43 2015 UTC,"I usually use singularity or pull for the primer. Throw does home in on targets though.  Honestly my typical power usage with adept it warp only on single targets that are primer or targets with armor or a barrier. Any unarmed target is pull (upgraded fully to the double pull tank) followed by throw (also at the double rank with the increased biotic combo damage). 2 biotic combo explosions real fast, and if you are carrying lightly on the weapons to get the 200% recharge bonus you can rip them off within a second or so of each other. Rinse and repeat. Super fun, although not as fun as the Vanguard OP charge/nova combo"
masseffect,3d7nxb,itsamamaluigi,1 point,Wed Jul 15 03:35:31 2015 UTC,"Warp is only a good primer when used against shielded or armored enemies, because Pull and Singularity don't work against them. I use Warp as a standalone damaging attack or as a primer for shielded enemies.  Throw does home in on targets. Double Throw homes in on two different targets, if possible.  The way I play is very simple. Warp->Throw for shielded/armored enemies, Pull->Throw for unshielded ones. Singularity once in a while if there are enemies swarming near me from one direction. Energy Drain if my shields are down and there's a shielded enemy nearby. Grenades for bosses."

I think they churned that DLC out in like 3 or 4 months. That DLC was also already pretty big, so adding any more code, animations, textures, etc for those little details would have added more to that 4+ gb download. Going back to ME1, it was released in the early years of the x360 so I'm sure they didn't know the system's true potential (see ME3, Halo 4, etc). So maybe they had this idea of populating the maps of planets and hubs from the beginning but they put that stuff on hold prevent pushing the system to its perceived limits at that time. So all we get are a few small instances of one or two husks running around instead of civilian npcs running and screaming for their lives as they are being attacked by their neighbors turned husks ¯_(ツ)_/¯"

What could they learn from other companies in regards to DLC?  Too much ""core"" stuff was DLC. On the other hand, DLC parts like Omega, while still too expensive, were good but ultimately optional additions.  I think that they could learn from CD Projekt Red and other companies that give out free DLC once in a while. If they're going to have a lot of DLC, why not give a bit out for free to get people interested? I also think that getting one or two free weapons added in a patch is better than having a whole bunch of DLC weapons for sale.

What could they learn from other companies in regards to DLC?   In most cases, I think Bioware handled their DLC pretty well, a lot of people burn Bioware for having released From Ashes on Day 1, but from experience, I think it was a matter of ""that mission/character didn't feel fleshed out enough/ready enough when we did our submissions to Microsoft/Sony/Nintendo so we put it as a DLC and submitted it early enough to still have it as Day 1 in the end."" I still feel like Bioware should've released it a month or two after the main game though to not have the whole situation they had to deal with though. That said, I do believe that they could learn from other companies to lower their DLC prices (even if I bought them all on day 1 and/or when I learned about them). I love these DLCs and have the money for them, but I see a few people asking which DLC they should get as they're short on money... Either that or have them bundled up with the game or something.   Which is your favorite DLC?   Not very original but The Citadel's my favorite. It's fan-service throwing itself in my arms, it can't can't be my favorite.

To me it depends on the contents, is it crucial to the story or is it just a visual/gameplay add-on like armors and guns? Story-driven DLCs increase the experience and could be implanted to the next game to have a small or large effect. Guns and armors make your playthrough a bit fresher but they won't add to your experience in any way. Since we're talking about Mass Effect and Bioware adds a new aspect to the game in each of they're story-driven DLCs, I'd say they are important for a complete experience.

If BioWare wants to charge a bit more for their DLC then I don't really mind.   Do you think it's important to have the DLCs for a complete game experience?   Absolutely. Some of the missions really expand on the lore and the characters, making them vital for the Mass Effect experience.    How do you think Bioware handled their DLC practices?

That's ludicrous when the trilogy can be found for $5, and the most recent entry is over 3 years old. Every time I see a reddit thread showing a sale on the series, at least half the posts say 'sale on dlc yet?'  Also,  while you're fixing the pricing, toss bioware points.  I really did like that the multiplayer dlc was free, as to not split the playerbase, but then there's microtransactions to spoil it.  On a more positive note, Citadel is the best dlc I've ever played (along side tiny tina's from BL2).  Leviathan was pretty good too, and honestly should have been included.

I've played with and without those and find my game is a thousand times better with them. Most of the others are just nice to have but not essential.   I think there are good and bad points about how Bioware handled the DLC. It's good that they had so much of it and such a good variety (story, weapons/gear, whole new sections of game). It's bad that the price points were often a bit off in my opinion - Javik should have been free, whereas Omega and Lair are fine as being expensive (not essential but huge efforts by the devs). Most of the rest should have been much lower price. Again, all my opinion.  My favourite DLC would have to be Citadel. Of course. Closely followed by Arrival and Zaeed and Kasumi. I've never played Overlord but I'll get it one of these days. I hear good things.

Especially with DLC like arrival, Javik, Shadowbroker, that stuff is like so essential to the story and should just be in the games anyway.  Like I said above too much essential story stuff being sold as DLC.   My favorite DLC is a tie between Citadel and Shadowbroker. Citadel is literally glorified fanservice and I love it. Shadowbroker was so intense, the soundtrack was incredible, and I loved being able to rekindle my relationship with Liara."

Bring Down the Sky and Overlord are fun, self-contained escapades that I enjoy immensely, despite their lack of impact on the main story.  Lair of the Shadow Broker and Arrival are fun, and do advance the plot a little, but neither of them are too important.  Liara becomes Shadow Broker anyway, and Arrival is only a plot device that gets a few lines of dialogue in ME3.  So both of those are pretty self-contained.  Of course, Extended Cut is necessary.  Refusal is my favorite ending, and without it, I feel the ending is a betrayal to the themes of the series overall."
masseffect,3d4s8j,HecticEpic,1 point,Tue Jul 14 00:27:19 2015 UTC,"Do you think it's important to have the DLCs for a complete game experience?   Depends on the DLC. The only one I've never played from the trilogy is Pinnacle Station, because of its poor reviews. (ME3 Citadel seems to have reworked many of the same ideas, with much better results.) For most of them, it's a factor of a) how enjoyable the experience is and b) what you get to take away from it, in terms of gear, new squaddies, additions/enhancements to the plot, and other goodies. Kasumi's DLC is important for more power-oriented classes because of the Locust, but the ""crime caper"" part of the mission is also fun, and I've come to appreciate Kasumi herself because of her power set. And some of the relative value of the DLCs will change with subsequent playthroughs; Citadel holds up very well, because of the different experiences you have even with different energy levels for the party, and also the repeat-playability of the Arnax Arena fights. It's nice to have the Bloodpack weapons in ME3, as the Punisher and Executioner can shorten a lot of fights in the way that the Cain did in ME2, and thus tighten up additional playthroughs.   How do you think Bioware handled their DLC practices? What could they learn from other companies in regards to DLC?   Yeah, about that From Ashes debacle... Seriously, I think that they realized that they really screwed the pooch there (and not just with that, but with their general trying to cut corners while maximizing revenue), which is why I thought of Citadel as The Apology in a lot of ways.    Which is your favorite DLC?   Citadel, but I also have a lot of affection for Lair of the Shadow Broker; I think that it's by far the most effective use of Liara in the franchise. (She even looks different.)"
masseffect,3d4s8j,halloweenjack,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:26:58 2015 UTC,Pinnacle Station would be fine if one of its levels wasn't glitched to be damn near impossible on higher difficulties. I think most of its actual problems stem from larger issues with ME1's combat.
masseffect,3d4s8j,Neander7hal,1 point,Thu Jul 16 13:34:44 2015 UTC,"Yes I think most of all there should be a clear difference in DLCs. Some are for content and some are skin/weapons/multiplayer stuff. Without knowing loads about how other companies do, I think for ME it's done decent enough. I bought some skins and weapon packs, but not all. Content though I got everything, and for packs that add content the thing I enjoyed most about the ME packs is how they actually make a difference even for someone who completed the game numerous times before. It sort of feels like an ""enrichment"" rather than a ""add-on"". Leviathan. Right from the first mention of the Leviathan when planet exploring in ME1, this DLC was sort of one I always hoped would be made."
masseffect,3d4s8j,Bjens,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:39:16 2015 UTC,"In general, I don't think DLCs are necessary. Even in Mass Effect, they are just extra side missions that don't have a huge effect on the main story. They do, however, give fans of the series some extra content and background on a universe they love.  Bioware didn't handle their DLC as well as some companies, but better than most I think. Maybe the best DLC I've seen is for Fallout 3 and New Vegas - each one is a lengthy self-contained story with plenty of new gear as well. They were $10 at launch and are now $5 each, and you can get a ""Game of the Year"" edition that includes the base game AND all the DLC for $20, and they regularly go on sale for far less (I think I got FO3 GOTY for $5 on a Steam sale at one point).  Really, the main problem is pricing. Even if they don't put it on super sale like Fallout, at least bundle it in a package or have a GOTY edition of the game that comes with all of it for cheaper. At this point, years after launch, you should be able to get all the DLC for a flat $20 or something.  At least they didn't do what Gearbox did with Borderlands 2. Holy shit. That game has so much DLC it made me decide almost immediately that I wasn't going to buy any of it. And even if you buy the ""season pass"" you STILL don't get all the DLC because there's a bunch of other stuff.  I don't really have a problem with putting stuff like SP weapons or alternate appearances behind small microtransactions. Even though I'd rather they be free, it doesn't bother me and I just won't buy them. I don't feel the need to just buy absolutely everything.  Oh and my favorite DLC was Citadel. Just lots of fun all around, not too serious. The ones I never got were Pinnacle Station (ME1), Arrival (ME2), and Omega and Leviathan (ME3)."
masseffect,3d4s8j,itsamamaluigi,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:44:42 2015 UTC,"If you're still playing it, you should give Borderlands 2's DLC a shot. The stuff you would've gotten with the Season Pass (the four main DLCs) is all quality."
masseffect,3d4s8j,Neander7hal,1 point,Thu Jul 16 13:45:48 2015 UTC,"Nah, I got really bored with BL2 eventually. I think I'm around level 50 and I figure I must be getting close to the end of the main story... with my first character... after 72 hours. It's just a slog, and when I left off I was dying constantly. There's no way I'd play any of the DLC."
masseffect,3d4s8j,itsamamaluigi,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:10:25 2015 UTC,"OK that's really weird. The only way I can think you'd get that experience is from doing way too much farming, or from unknowingly playing in a higher-difficulty lobby. You usually beat the game around level 35, and it should be like 60 hours tops if you do every sidequest. Either way, sucks that it soured you on the game."
masseffect,3d4s8j,Neander7hal,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:23:57 2015 UTC,"I must have done too many sidequests. In the first game, doing side quests was critically important because a lot of story missions required you to hit a certain level, and if you weren't leveled enough you'd get smacked down. So I always just did a bunch of side quests and it made the game about the right difficulty.  Also, I play single player.  So you're saying that in BL2 I should AVOID too many sidequests? Do enemies scale with me? My gear isn't very good either, last I remember (I put it down a couple years ago)."
masseffect,3d4s8j,itsamamaluigi,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:39:33 2015 UTC,Def didn't mean to say avoid side quests. It's more of picking the ones you can do easily instead of focusing by every single one.   And upgrading your gear is a continuous process.   And the level scaling is worse in some places than in others — Lynchwood in particular is really bad.
masseffect,3d4s8j,Neander7hal,1 point,Fri Jul 17 03:51:00 2015 UTC,"1) Yes.   2) In a perfect world, all DLC would either be free or nonexistent. In an imperfect one, they should be limited to aesthetics. The problem with adding these huge missions with plot lines integral to the story is that it gives the customer the feeling of buying a game for 100 dollars rather than 60. People want to pay for the complete experience, and they want it to be upfront.   I think Javik is probably one of the more heinous examples of this in all gaming history even. Here we have a character of extreme significance being locked behind a 10 dollar wall. Why? Because EA knew people would pay for it.   A shitty ending I can forgive. But this sort of bizarre content hostage taking? The only explanation is greed and malice towards the fan base.   If Andromeda becomes another ""DLCestiny"" I will not be purchasing it.   3) The Citadel. It brought back the diverse cast that I sorely missed in ME3."

I've watched the film a couple of days ago, too, but I fail to see this element of surprise everyone keeps talking about. James' character development is standard for such kind of film. Maybe I'm not getting something, but can someone explain to me what was the big surprise for you?"
masseffect,3d4wl8,Pwn3dg,13,Mon Jul 13 16:14:43 2015 UTC,"All the way through, it makes hints about the parallels between Shepard and Vega, how ""Shepard can save everybody"" (which we know is not true, eg Virmire).  Vega gradually loses his squad, which hits him hard, but as a marine he can ultimately accept. He is then given a very Shepard-esque choice: save the colonists or save the valuable intel on the Collectors. Now, the whole thing sets him up as the ""Paragon"" ideal, putting the many ahead of the few, no matter the consequences, particularly with his relationship to April, the little girl. So when he is then forced to make this choice, the audience are duped into thinking Vega would pick this option- which we later find out he didn't do. He picked the intel, knowing its importance to the Alliance in stopping the Collectors- essentially picking the ""Renegade"" choice. This then explains the title- ""Paragon Lost""."
masseffect,3d4wl8,Robertamus,21,Mon Jul 13 16:23:30 2015 UTC,What's even more tragic is the Intel became nullified once Shepard destroyed the collector base.

masseffect,3d4wjx,snakepliskin25,22,Mon Jul 13 15:31:02 2015 UTC,"Story-wise? No.  Samara is an asari Justicar, and has been so for centuries, plural. But even before that she was a mercenary and adventurer, so it's not like she had no combat experience. Bottom line: she has significantly more experience with the whole biotics thing than Shepard does. Maybe Shepard's biotics are stronger (though I rather suspect that asari, as a rule, have more biotic potential than humans) but Samara is much more experienced. That counts for a lot.  Jack was the prime test subject for a Cerberus project aimed at unlocking humanity's inner biotic potential (or something). Her raw biotic potential is greater than nearly any other human (with the possible exception of Gillian Grayson, who was essentially selected as Subject Zero 2.0) and she's survived for years with nothing but her biotics to back her up, meaning she's experienced too.  Kaidan has an L2 biotic implant, which-- at least at the start of the series-- makes him more powerful a biotic than Shepard, who has an L3. Later on, who knows?  That's not to say, in a one-on-one fight, Adept or Vanguard or Sentinel Shepard wouldn't be able to overcome Jack or Samara, just that their biotics are probably outclassed."
masseffect,3d4wjx,TC01,6,Mon Jul 13 16:15:22 2015 UTC,Didn't Kaidan say in the first mass effect that shepards biotics were stronger?
masseffect,3d4wjx,Kingsnake661,14,Mon Jul 13 16:48:29 2015 UTC,"Yes and no.  He said L2 ""typical"" spike higher then most L3's, except for yours of course.  People take that to mean Shepard's more powerful then Kaidan, when it's prolly more accurate to say he's more powerful then a common L3, not nessessirly Kaidan.  But that's moot.  The way i understand it, cerburs upgraded Shepard's implant when they had his rather ravaged body, and upgraded him to an L5, either the L5X,(adept) or, IIRC, the L5N (vanguards.)  IMO, that, along with whatever else they had to do to repair him, has enhanced him even future.  But it's speculation at best.  In game, you'd never even know he WAS biotic.  A flaw in the game i wish they'd addressed.  They did a great job of working your  class, and even race in the DA games, but in Mass Effect, as far the story, cutsceens and dialog dumps are concered, Shepard an AR touting Solider, and nothing else.  Save 2 exceptions in ME3, both DLC, that hint at his class.  In Omega, if your an enginer, you get a special dialog/cutsceen.  On the citidal, during the climax, you'll use biotics in a cutsceen, the only one i know of.  And that's it."
masseffect,3d4wjx,Neander7hal,6,Mon Jul 13 17:03:33 2015 UTC,Doesn't Shepard have better implants than Jack then?
masseffect,3d4wjx,Kingsnake661,8,Mon Jul 13 17:36:05 2015 UTC,"Until you upgrade her, then technically yes. But Shepard hasn't been groomed since childhood to make the most use of his/her implants."
masseffect,3d4wjx,Kingsnake661,3,Mon Jul 13 17:46:18 2015 UTC,"possibly, but like with kadian, that doesn't nessessirly matter.  L3's where upgrades to L2 because they were alot SAFER, but a little weaker.  Not to mention biotic talent is random in the people who have the skill.  Some a extrodinary, others less so.  The implant can only do so much.  I think lore wise Jack is the strongest, maybe second strongest human alive at the time... (Jullien in the novels is said too be like a savont biotic... so who knows.)"
masseffect,3d4wjx,BeforeTheRobots,2,Mon Jul 13 19:11:53 2015 UTC,Its hard to say whats lore and whats not though seeing as mass effect is a video game. It's not as if its based on a book. Surely the gameplay can be taken as lore.

masseffect,3d4wjx,masseffectboy,2,Tue Jul 14 05:33:34 2015 UTC,"Yes, biotic potential doesn't increase*, but experience at manipulating dark energy absolutely matters.  After centuries of use, an individual's ability to consciously control the eezo nodules in their nervous system would almost certainly improve. Their metabolism would likely improve too (human biotic soldiers require more nutrition than the average soldier).  What's more, one could likely learn to perform other biotic actions over the course of a long life of biotics usage. They couldn't exceed their own limits in using those powers though.  *except in rare cases. See also: Jack and Gillian Grayson (ME: Deception). Though this didn't happen naturally obviously.  EDIT: So what I guess I'm trying to say is that lore-wise, Samara probably can do more with her biotics than Shepard can do, it probably takes a lot less out of her to use them, and she's probably much ""quicker on the draw"" as it were... but yes, you're right, Shepard could still have a higher raw potential and that would be that."
masseffect,3d4wjx,Captain_Meatshield,2,Tue Jul 14 06:41:06 2015 UTC,"That is the one great issue with the game. You may as well always been a soldier, because you always have the Avenger in cutscenes.  Though if BioWare has learned anything, and the last two DLCs they put out, Omega nd Citadel, are anything to show, they'll change this and have more unique interactions if you are biotic or not.  I'd love this to factor into gameplay as well, like being able to send a drone through a vent or something.  But on topic, I think Jack and Samara are more powerful than Shepard at biotics only by dint of Samara's centuries of experience, and Jack being engineered for it."
masseffect,3d4wjx,masseffectboy,2,Tue Jul 14 02:50:18 2015 UTC,"In a fight adept shep would win. I'd say in pure biotic terms he's just behind Jack, though he did get re-built so id presume theyd use the best of the best for shepard, and jack is a cerberus creation.

It's particularly noticeable in Shep's Apartment.  I tend to leave it out of the installations. Kinda hurts immersion having a painting depict something that hasn't happened yet.

masseffect,3d19z2,jaytoddz,13,Tue Jul 14 06:11:58 2015 UTC,"If by ""right"" you mean its a good idea to forcibly alter the very existence of every sentient creature in the universe, transforming them into hybrid abominations through which their ability for free will and self-achieving evolution are violently stripped from them.  The only means of escape from such a hellish existence would be, of course, suicide."
masseffect,3d19z2,Rebel_Turian,11,Sun Jul 12 20:35:48 2015 UTC,"I'm not the biggest fan of synthesis either, but come on. ""Abominations""? Yeah, they're hybrids, but I'd hardly call them abominations. Plus, how exactly is their free will ""stripped"" from them? Pretty sure they're still sapient beings that can make their own choices. The only difference is that now they can see things from a synthetic point of view.  As for the evolution thing, you make it sound like they've been stripped of a constitutional right to evolve, which doesn't even make sense. Besides, within the canon of ME, synthesis is the ultimate stage of evolution. Therefore, synthesis doesn't ""strip"" them of evolution, it just accelerates their evolutionary journey to the final stage."
masseffect,3d19z2,cmotdibbler,6,Sun Jul 12 22:04:49 2015 UTC,"I think the problem most people have with synthesis is that it's accelerating evolution down a path that the reapers feel is the final stage. The star child was the AI that created the reapers and believes they are doing the right thing. Obviously we disagree. That same entity is now saying Synthesis is the proper choice. Its kind of a tough sell.  Its like a biker gang breaking into your house, killing half your family and then the leader giving you life advice about what you should."
masseffect,3d19z2,Cerveza_por_favor,3,Sun Jul 12 22:32:03 2015 UTC,"Your analogy of the gang and then Star Child giving life advice is flawed.  The Reapers harvested advanced Civilisations to find a solution to the inevitable Organic V Synthetic war.   Shepard was the solution, Shepard needed his cybernetic implants to survive, but he/she hadn't let them change who he/she was, he/she was both Synthetic and Organic, but there was no conflict- his organic self had accepted his synthetic parts, they worked in harmony.   [This last part is more my head canon]  Shepard's Synthetic parts also became part of his/her persona, they react to emotions as Shepard does, look how they glow more red and become more prominent with Renegade, and how they settle and heal along with Shepard with Paragon.  Star child had to tell him/her about Synthesis, Star Child knew Shepard represented the solution. Star Child knew that understanding would bring peace, Organics and synthetics would finally understand eachother, and be able to co-exist peacefully.  This means that Star Child, and his Reapers would have fulfilled their prime directive given to them: Stop Organics and Synthetics from the inevitable fighting."

Whilst a lot people have Augmentations (Biotics having their ""L"" series implants and such) They are simply additions, they can live without them (in most cases) Shepard's body has melded with his/her implants, they require each other to function.

masseffect,3d19z2,Galactapuss,1 point,Sun Jul 12 21:17:14 2015 UTC,"Actually I believe it does. The reapers were built to collect data on species that grew so advanced that it built synthetics, which seemingly always ended up killing their makers.   Reapers were designed to only relent in collect if either annihilated or if they found the 'perfectly evolved species.'  Synthesis submits Shepard as the apex of evolution."

Synthesis affected all species that are currently alive, well what about future species. Synthesis, as stupid and space magicy as it already is, did not change physics at the fundamental level. This means that at some point in the future a species will evolve and they will begin to develop technology and eventually AI. Is synthesis then forced on this species? What if they don't want it? Well according to the reaper logic either you join us or you be destroyed, and the worst part is we will be part of the damn reaper army and destroy that species with them.  Also there is no way you could trust yourself in a society that had accepted the reapers. Because indoctrination has clearly been established, how do you know your actions are your own?   Other than that synthesis is too deus ex machina to be a proper ending anyway. You can't just change physics with a fucking light show not after the story has been so grounded in theoretical physics and fleshed out backstory."

But, I feel like eventually Microsoft would have wanted entries a lot sooner than Bioware would like and down the line, I think exclusivity would have hurt the ME franchise.  Make no mistake, I love Microsoft and I'm a huge Xbox fan, but I believe EA buying Bioware, and allowing them to take their time with the ME games, was a very smart choice."

In real life I wouldn't let terrorist, which was going to destroy whole planet, live just to save 2 or 3 scientists Why is councelor's life more worth than anyone else? So why should I sacrifice 1000 human lifes for 3 council members and crew of one ship?

Sure Heretics are something else... Basically when I played ""my best"" playthrough, I reached 90% paragon and 100% renegade (in ME1 and ME2). In ME3 I had like 65 Renegade / 35 Paragon"
masseffect,3d3xn4,BattleCrier,1 point,Mon Jul 13 22:14:46 2015 UTC,"In ME1 there are a handful of Paragon/Renegade decisions which have an impact on ME3. Most of them are fairly minor, background stuff. But one in particular has pretty significant consequences. It's hard to give detail on that without major spoilers.  In ME3, almost all missions involve acquiring War Assets. But you don't need to absolutely max this out in order to get a positive outcome. There are some things you can skip. Hanging over from ME2, yes there are some important things which affect your ability to acquire War Assets, most notably certain characters' loyalty missions, but in some cases closing off one opportunity opens up another that you wouldn't have otherwise had."

Ashley's the stereotype of the caucasian patriotic religious human of the ME universe.  Garrus, while he's more used to dealing with different species, he's been prone to believe stereotypes of each races because almost everyone on the Citadel have viewed Krogans as rebellious mercenaries and Quarians as space rats salvaging and hiding in cargo holds for transport. And his lines are said with somewhat of an ""innocent assumed belief"", like saying Canadians live in igloos, hunt for food and it always snows when in reality, we live in normal houses, we have a lot of food markets and it's been 86-90F all week.  While I agree that Garrus sounds a bit racist, it's less of a singled out character saying it rather than a whole galaxy saying it. Garrus simply assumes and believes it because everyone else assumes so too."
masseffect,3d0pl3,aoibhealfae,8,Sun Jul 12 15:51:47 2015 UTC,"I actually got this response ; ""Garrus can be as racist as he wants"". =_= I feel bad for Wrex and Tali. I really hate how Garrus wanted them to be 'contrite' for their ancestor's mistakes (its like blaming people today for their ancestor's ugly history like slave ownership) and that he's quite okay with the Krogans going extinct and the Quarians being exiled. In ME3 (I finished Tuchanka's mission just now), he said ""I would take the deal. I admire your restraint"" when Shepard says she wouldn't accept the Salarian deal. He 'admired' Eve for her struggle with the genophage and then he's quite okay with sabotaging the cure and perpetuating Eve and all female Krogan's suffering. Wth..."

masseffect,3d0pl3,terefor,58,Sun Jul 12 19:59:09 2015 UTC,Reapers were underpowered in Mass Effect 3.
masseffect,3d0pl3,Candidate88766,17,Sun Jul 12 15:24:36 2015 UTC,"BioWare really nerfed the Reapers in ME3. Unfortunately they kind of had to, as they'd written themselves into a corner. Reapers were twice as fast as any other ships in the galaxy, had superior weapons, shielding, armour, and cyberwarfare systems. They had no need for supply lines. They had an essentially unlimited quantity of ground troops, and could create new ones to overcome any obstacle or opponent. These ground troops required no food or shelter, and never suffered issues with morale. Finally, they had a weapon that could turn anyone into a double agent without them even realising they were aiding the Reapers.  The Reapers were the perfect military force. Crucible or not, they would realistically have won.  Unfortunately for BioWare, because they'd made such powerful villains the only way for the player to win (and the nature of videogames means the player has to win) was for the Reapers to act inefficiently, even downright idiotically."
masseffect,3d0pl3,terefor,3,Sun Jul 12 19:14:28 2015 UTC,"It would have been better if the Reapers devasted 95% of the space-faring galaxy except for a few planets/systems, where the final fight would take place, that way the could make the Reapers powerful and also deal with desperation, instead of that kid and the Thessia mission where Kai Walking Plot Armor Leng showed up."
masseffect,3d0pl3,Candidate88766,14,Sun Jul 12 19:19:50 2015 UTC,"I wanted something like this, with the Reapers slowly taking parts of the galaxy.  I would've had the Reapers lay siege to the Citadel shortly after the Mars mission, with the Normandy having to flee. The Citadel seals its arms, but nobody can get in or out anymore. Omega would've become the hub for ME3 (I would've changed Cerberus capturing it).   The Citadel attack would've been shorter, and played from Bailey's perspective. Cerberus sleeper agents would seize control, allowing the Reapers access to the station. The relay network would shut down, paralyzing the galaxy. The Normandy, thanks to its IFF, would be able to continue using the relays. Cerberus ships would also be able to use the relays: they aided the Reapers in taking the station, and are a useful tool for the Reapers to use.  From then onwards, after every mission bits of the galaxy would go dark. Sectors would become inaccessible, displaying ""Signal Lost"" or something to that effect. As the story enters its endgame the Reapers would be taking control of more and more of the galaxy.  Eventually TIM would reactivate the Relay Network from the Citadel. He believes he's doing it because he needs the Crucible to reach the Citadel in order for his plan of controlling the Reapers to be enacted. In reality the Reapers want to wipe out the remaining fleets of the galaxy in one blow, using TIM to create a trap which Shepard has no choice but to fall into.   Obviously the story would've needed significant changes in order for this to work, but I think something like this would've made the Reapers into a much greater threat than they were."
masseffect,3d0pl3,terefor,14,Sun Jul 12 19:33:35 2015 UTC,Reaper troops or actual reapers? and do you mean in the actual gameplay (reaper on rannoch) or in the lore?
masseffect,3d0pl3,seagullfriend,26,Sun Jul 12 15:27:33 2015 UTC,"Actual Reapers, such as the one on Rannoch, with horrible aim for a machine that has killed thousands of civilizations, and the one that guards the beam at the end (it's Harbinger I think?), it hit Shepard almost directly and he was relatively okay. Also, the time they took to destroy buildings on Earth and to simply move around."
masseffect,3d0pl3,terefor,22,Sun Jul 12 15:29:54 2015 UTC,"The beam seemed to be intended to be used against starships and things like buildings. A human running around is a different sort of target - imagine trying to hit a guy who's running back and forth with a tank's (or a battleship's) main gun.  I'm prepared to accept that Shepard's body has been modified enough to survive a reaper beam hitting the ground a couple of metres in front of him (and only be pretty seriously injured - he looked like he was having to hold his guts in). As well as his cybernetic upgrades courtesy of Cerberus, In ME2 there were things like skin and skeleton mods you could research too. He also had his battle armour and shields."
masseffect,3d0pl3,seagullfriend,4,Sun Jul 12 16:01:14 2015 UTC,"Other cycles probably had extremely small and fast ships, and targeting systems from today are better than the Reapers'.

masseffect,3d0pl3,terefor,13,Sun Jul 12 16:04:40 2015 UTC,"Other cycles probably had extremely small and fast ships    That's why the reapers also have fighter swarms, as seen in the final battle."
masseffect,3d0pl3,TaralasianThePraxic,4,Sun Jul 12 16:10:02 2015 UTC,"Good point, they also had praetorians, harvesters and the collector bugs, which makes me wonder, why didn't they use them more? With the bugs they could paralyze whole squads and the praetorians and harvesters could have guarded the beam. Still, when a Reaper dies, a civilization dies, and the Reapers think they are a superior form of life, they should have better weaponry."
masseffect,3d0pl3,Fimconte,6,Sun Jul 12 16:13:56 2015 UTC,"As we know from Vigil in ME1, the Reapers abandoned their Prothean slaves (who were revealed to be the Collectors in ME2) when they left the Milky Way for the cycle to begin again. Since Shepard wiped out pretty much all of the Collectors at the end of ME2, there were no more Protheans to 'Reaperise' and thus no Collector forces to use in the Reaper War. Given the insectoid modifications made to the Collectors, I would imagine that the seeker swarms are tied somehow to the Protheans, and hence not useable by the Reapers by the time they arrived en masse."

Some people call him whiny and brooding, but I don't see him that way. I see him as someone who has experienced a lot in his life, and has a deep, thoughtful, intelligent personality. And I think it speaks to the strength of their friendship / relationship that he trusts Shepard enough to confide in him (or her).

Did I mention that he's handsome, too? He had these exotic old looks. Mediterranean maybe? I imagine if he grew his hair out, it'd be wavy and maybe a bit curly.

I should elaborate a bit because that sounds a bit weird with the way I put it: what I often hear from Mass Effect fans is that ME1 had these deep, awesome RPG mechanics that were stripped away in ME2 and ME3. I.e. ""ME2 and 3 were dumbed down for the shooter-loving casuals! They took away all the awesome RPG elements (ex. the inventory, the weapon mods, the variety of weapons)!""  The inventory interface in ME1 was an ugly mess to navigate, and all it really served to do in the game was force me to occasionally stop at a merchant on the Citadel to dump all the spare assault rifles, armor, and weapon mods I was lugging around. That or just mass convert it all to omni-gel.  Now, this alone wouldn't be so bad if all the weapons and mods I picked up actually felt like they were different from the gear that I was currently using. But alas, ME1 failed awfully in that regard. All the equipment upgrading in the game just boiled down to picking the gear with the bigger numbers: swap out all my Heat Sink IIs with Heat Sink IIIs, swap out all my Avenger Is with Avenger IIIs, etc.  Compare that to ME2 or 3. While there are ostensibly fewer weapons and mods (no mods in the case of ME2) than in ME1, they actually function differently in combat. Using the Widow sniper rifle felt different from using the Incisor (big, weighty single-shot vs 3-round burst, respectively), using the Graal Spike Thrower felt different from using the Disciple shotgun, using the Mattock felt different from using the Avenger (more accurate, semi-auto vs bigger clip and fully auto firing). There were actually meaningful, observable differences between weapons in ME2 and 3 that didn't just boil down to ""this one has bigger numbers""."
masseffect,3d0pl3,Potataro,5,Sun Jul 12 20:52:14 2015 UTC,"I agree with you.  The inventory system is extremely tedious and the level of micromanaging needed was one of the aspects that always kept me from actually playing ME1.  I only played it after 2+3 when I was emotionally invested enough in the story to learn how to deal with the inventory.  3 definitely did it best when it came to the weapon system, even though I miss being able to carry around heavy weapons like in 2 (Cain is love, Cain is life)."

There's no reason to believe anything the Catalyst says. Considering the fact that we already know that the Reapers created the Citadel, and the Catalyst claims to be the Citadel, there's a lot of evidence that it may be a Reaper trap.  Also, if you remember one of Mordin's conversations from ME2, there's danger in using the Crucible, even if it does work.  It throws off the sociotechnological balance of the galaxy, because it involves using tech that is far beyond our own without understanding it.  Instead of advancing our culture by overcoming limitations with our own tech, we would be essentially uplifting ourselves before our society is ready.  Once those limitations are gone, there's no advancement, and culture stagnates.  I believe the galaxy as a whole would be better off if, in a future cycle, using what Shepard has done and Liara's warnings, the living beings (both organic and synthetic) were able to defeat the Reapers conventionally using the own tech that they developed.  Javik:  While I think he's a well-developed character, and has some incredibly interesting dialogue, I think his presence hurts the narrative. I can't really pinpoint why I think that.  It may be because he ruins the mystique and allure of the protheans, or that it's highly implausible that the only prothean important enough to be put into stasis would be a foot soldier like him, and not a prominent scientist or political leader.  Whatever it is, I find the narrative goes better without him."
masseffect,3d0pl3,El-Grunto,12,Sun Jul 12 20:50:10 2015 UTC,"Refusal: Even if the Crucible was a trap, how would it be worse than everyone dying, which happens with the refusal ending? Make them deader? If it does work, maybe we aren't ""ready"" for synthesis, but we are for destroying the Reapers, it wouldn't change society that much since the Reapers were almost unknown before they attacked. Why is there an advantage to figuring out technology on our own? Humanity in Mass Effect would have never been important if they hadn't boosted their tech by hundreds of years.  Javik: He was not a simple food soldier, he was an Avatar of Vengeance and he commanded a million warriors, Protheans were conquerors, so warriors were more valued. I liked how he wasn't a scientist, he didn't know much about tech and culture, so the mystery isn't ruined."
masseffect,3d0pl3,meshaber,3,Sun Jul 12 20:56:44 2015 UTC,"Javik also wasn't the only Prothean put into stasis. At the end of ME1 you find an entire planet dedicated to reviving the Protheans through a team of Prothean scientists. The Prothean scientists and their support teams were to wake from stasis when the galaxy was safe enough to do so. However, it was so long before whatever conditions were met to determine a ""safe"" galaxy that the majority of the team had died. One by one, stasis pods were powered off to conserve power. First went the support staff's pods, then the lesser scientists, and eventually just the head scientists were left."

Like I can't express to you how much that bothers me and how much that makes me hate Kai Leng. Granted he was suffering from Keprals syndrome and was in the very late stages iirc and I can't imagine how that would do anything other than slow down his movements, reaction speed, and finesse. Really in my opinion that's the only reason Kai Leng won that fight and if thane had been healthy he would have definitely won. Others may disagree but that's my opinion."

As you progress through ME3 they have plot points to explain this (the troopers really are mindless storm-trooper experiments, and TIM is indoctrinated) but at the very beginning of ME3 all your characters seem to have made the sudden shift without knowing any of that.  It just feels like such a drastic shift in tone and writing, like ME2 writer was intrigued by nuance and the possibility that Control was a necessary evil, then they handed over to ME3 writer who was like ""nah we just need some bad guys to shoot""."
masseffect,3d0pl3,krabbby,20,Sun Jul 12 18:20:23 2015 UTC,"To be fair, remember Cerberus in ME1? The evil,  racist terrorists who experimented with mind control and Reaper tech?

I mean shit Cerberus almost found out a way to beat the reapers that didn't invoice fucking up the whole galaxy and would have had an extremely minimal overall cost to the development, and they did it on their own without help from the council or alliance.  Imagine if mordin and others had helped out with his projects.  War over without the crucible and just at the cost of a few thousand humans, which were being murdered by the reapers anyways"

masseffect,3d0pl3,TaralasianThePraxic,34,Sun Jul 12 19:51:37 2015 UTC,Mass Effect 1 is dull in every aspect including it's story. The story is painful until the 2nd half of the game. If it was a game by itself I would say it fails as a game.
masseffect,3d0pl3,IAmDarkridge,21,Sun Jul 12 16:11:35 2015 UTC,"I finished the first one a couple of days ago (for about the 15th time) and you could not be more wrong. It's a beautiful game.

masseffect,3d0pl3,remo_raptor,12,Sun Jul 12 17:36:17 2015 UTC,"While I love the original, I have to argue against the whole 'more shocking moments' thing there. 2 and 3 definitely had more moments that shocked me, from Legion's reveal to Mordin's death in ME3. Sovereign's speech in ME1 was sublime, but the tangible mortality of the whole crew during the suicide mission was just more intense and shocking for me."

To me the game is incredibly boring before Vermire. The story is better after that, but that is like the final 25% of the main story. In comparison to the later installments it is a lot more hit or miss for me on the story.  The combat is clunky with a cover mechanic that is unintuitive at best."

Like it was great plot wise but the constant recruitment and loyalty missions with so many characters made me fell very detached from them as I only brought the same two with me most of the time. I also felt ""winning"" the suicide mission and not having any losses was actually far too easy, all you had to do was do all the loyalty missions asap and get the upgrades. I did that on my first play through of Mass Effect 2 just because I wanted to get the full story for the characters and the upgrades looked cool..."

I don't necessarily agree with them but I can see where they are coming from. But to me ME2 is a game about characters and I really loved that. The first and third games dealt with with much larger and imminent threats to the whole galaxy, something I know a quite a few people complain about but I actually liked the large scale of the games. But ME2, at least compared to the first and third games, felt like the issue wasn't huge and as important. To humans maybe but not the Galaxy. I liked the smaller scale of ME2 just as much as the larger scales of the first and third game but because it wasn't such a prominent issue it seemed like the focus was more on the crew and characters, at least in my opinion."

Just because you get your panties in a bunch when she first meets you and tells you exactly how she feels doesn't make her bitchy, it makes her honest, although brutally at times (not a bad thing IMO). Its actually refreshing. Not everyone has to be your best buddy from the get go, and I think it makes the relationship arch better, whether you romance or just become friends.  Jack sucks and is really annoying in ME2. I do think she is redeemed in ME3 though.  Quarians suck. I think the concept of them is awful. In a futuristic technologic wonderland how the hell is it even possible that they've had to live in suits for 300ish years. You would think SOMEONE would have figured out an artificial immune system for them by now, with like nano bots or some shit. Is every quarian baby born on death's doorstep because it doesn't have a suit? How about genetic modifications to give newborn quarians some kind of immune system? And it wouldn't have to be a Quarian that figured it out. A salarian scientist would make shit-zillion credits off that research. How do they go to the bathroom without getting sick, wouldn't they be chronically sick from opening their suit's butt flap all the time? And a lack of bugs led to a weakly evolved immune system? Really? Ok so there is no vermin at all on Rannoch? No ""rats"" or anything? Sure, ok. Fuck Quarians.  I don't like Liara. At all. First she is an annoying and naive asari ""teenager""(...?). Like really? You've been alive for 100 years and still haven't really picked up social skills yet? Ok, fine. Then in ME2 her new job kind of requires at least moderately decent social skills and understanding of different peoples of different species motives and of the way people think. Wouldn't you know it, in two years she ditches her job she is passionate about because it is no longer convenient to the story, figured out people, and is basically a mob boss (the first thing she says in ME2 is a threat to someone). And if she isn't a mob boss at that point then just wait until the shadow broker dlc or ME3 and she is literally running a, at least somewhat, criminal organization."

Full-renegade Shepard generally just comes across as an unpleasant individual, even more so in the first two games.

I really, really don't care for Tali at all, to the point that I honestly wish Anderson and Udina didn't veto you if you try to keep her from joining the crew.  The Hammerhead is amazing.

Having basically 1 shopping centre with cabs to all the other places in ME2 was a serious step backwards, even if it felt more lived in.  ME3 is the best of both worlds - it feels like there's a war on.  It feels like it's real, rather than a sterile, half empty interior design shop in ME1, or the disconnected and small-scale version in ME2."

Gameplay-wise I feel like ME3 strikes the best balance of ""fun/exciting/accessible moment-to-moment combat"" vs ""interesting choices and character specialization"".  Still, hardly an unpopular opinion.  There are many vocal folks out there who agree with you."

He's one of, if not the, the most level-headed characters in the entire trilogy.  His sexuality ""change"" is a bit questionable, but at the same time it's not awful to have a character develop feelings over a long time rather than just in 1 game."
masseffect,3d0pl3,shoe_owner,8,Sun Jul 12 17:54:27 2015 UTC,I don't think he turns gay. I'd rather say he becomes bisexual...or he was the whole time but didn't care for Shep that much...or is just more into girls. Well he did comment on EDI's body once.

masseffect,3d0pl3,Mathyon,4,Sun Jul 12 18:15:58 2015 UTC,"Mass Effect started off as a racing game and the Mako was the default vehicle, but as the level designers got more and more carried away with their unbelievably elabourate tracks, the story and shooty mechanics got tacked on and built up to such a degree that the original focus of the game was entirely lost, resulting in a much poorer game overall."

She's really the only squadmate I somewhat dislike.  ME1's gameplay was absolutely horrible. Good story is what kept me playing it, along with the fact that you needed to play it if you wanted Wrex, the Council, and the Rachni Queen.  I like Broshep more than Femshep."

Their inclusion allowed for some interesting twists, but overall they were a weak plot element.  The Mass Effect universe is full of interesting factions each with their own agendas. I would much rather have a played a story where the galaxy is on the verge of civil war, with Shepard forced to choose between sides that each have valid reasons and motives. We could've truly played as a Spectre rather than as a galactic hero. Do you focus on diplomacy, negotiation and espionage, or do you lean more towards assassination and intimidation?   The Mass Effect universe is rich enough that we didn't need a galactic-level threat to make it interesting. There's so much scope for interesting conflict among all the various races and factions in the galaxy. The Reapers were an unnecessary and frankly rather generic threat."

There are moments when Meer delivers a better performance (look for Joker's worst joke on YT).  People say Hale has more emotion and Meer sounds dull. The Shepard character is meant to be a PTSD, no nonsense battle hardened warrior. Hale to me sounds obviously like an actor, whereas I could believe Meer."

Jennifer Hale is a horrid voice actress. Her lines are forced, wooden, leaves pauses in the wrong places, and in the intense and emotional scenes just reads it like a script.   The large amount of Liara-Femshep head canon and fan fiction/drawings that floats about is very creepy. Especially the little blue children ones :/  Unless the Geth are already dead, Destroy is a horrid option. Control and Synthesis are much better options.  The indoctrination theory is stupid.

You'll never know when she isn't spying on you.  Takes up an entire cabin wall with like 20 monitors for an elaborate screensaver. Three games worth of established scientific intelligence evaporates instantly when she whines about Earth not bailing out Thessia and argues with Javik over what is blatantly true."
masseffect,3d0pl3,jennaberry,3,Sun Jul 12 21:22:58 2015 UTC,I don't like romancing Garrus. At the beginning you basically coerce him into sleeping with you and the supposed feelings you have for each other seem to just come out of nowhere. Femshep is down right creepy (and I'm gonna say it) rapey with her flirtations. Garrus seems legitimately uncomfortable with her advances.

God help you if you are an infiltrator.  -DLC is IMO bullshit and I hate the concept of such naked cash grabbing (not that it's kept me from buying), but the fact that it wasn't locked down in the DLCs how they played in terms of order in the story and cannon was annoying.  -You should've been able to tell TIM to cram it more often and more resoundingly in 2. Why could you tell the council to cram it so much more effectively in 1 and TIM can mollify you so easily in 2?"

masseffect,3d2vla,TheButchman101,3,Mon Jul 13 02:17:54 2015 UTC,"I know exactly how you feel, this was one of the biggest problem I had with ME3, I'm sorry to tell you but it does not get better, you will be stuck with only 2 options of dialogue in this game. Moreover, remember when Shepard did not say one word without your input ? That's gone, now autodialogue rules supreme. Especialy in secondary quests, you'll never even be in a ""real"" dialogue anymore for those, just Shepard being a creepy stalker listening to what everyone says.    There is really nothing that can be done to improve the situation on this one I'm sorry.    It seems like Bioware is shying away from dialogue choices from now on, if you look at DA:I it has an incredibly few amount of conversations too. One Origin story+Ostagar has more dialogue choices than the whole of DA:I."
masseffect,3d2vla,AzertyKeys,2,Mon Jul 13 06:41:42 2015 UTC,"Undeniably true. ME3 moved in the direction of better dialogue with fewer (if often more meaningful) options. I do think it moved too far in that direction, but it moved in the right direction; if you look at the kind of dialogue options that have been cut, many of them are things like investigate trees or simple introductory sections. Personally, I don't consider choosing which order to ask for certain information in an important choice, and I'd rather have that information presented in a better written dialogue. I do lament the removal of the neutral option, but on the other hand ME3 has much more nuanced paragon/renegade options than the first two games, so I think it balances out.  You may also be underestimating the amount of autodialogue in the first game, there's quite a lot FYI."
masseffect,3d2vla,meshaber,2,Mon Jul 13 09:51:47 2015 UTC,"This was one of the worst things about Mass Effect 3 for me. I got the game a year after it came out, so I was already aware of all of the drama with the ending. No one prepared me for the loss of player choice, though. There were so many scenarios where I just yelled at my screen, ""But (my) Shepard wouldn't do that!"" Granted, there was a moment or two where the lack of dialogue choice worked well to keep the pacing, but overall, it was detrimental to the entire experience.  Really, I think that ME3 was just rushed. This is totally my opinion, but it just seemed like the sloppiest game of the series, not really worthy of being the ending. I've played through the first two multiple times; ME1 wasn't perfect but you could tell that Bioware was giving it their best shot, and ME2 was an overall improvement over the first, coming even closer to being perfect. I think I've only beat ME3 twice, in order to complete my male and female canon playthroughs. There are just so many faults with it that I couldn't stand it. I don't want to speak for the entire fanbase, but the majority of people I see that call ME3 their favorite game of the series tend to be people who jumped in and started with that game. I think that was Bioware's target audience for ME3 and it shows, but whilst alienating those who followed the story since Shepard's first assignment on Eden Prime.   Overall, ME3 was a disappointment, for the reason you stated among many others."
masseffect,3d2vla,RegularParadox,0,Mon Jul 13 10:41:48 2015 UTC,"Keep in mind, ME3 has the option to change conversation and situational choices. You can change it so you have more options to choose from or simply sit back and let conversations play out."

masseffect,3d2vla,IAmDarkridge,-1,Mon Jul 13 14:23:36 2015 UTC,Yeah idk I never noticed this. did you set the settings wrong. Because ME3 has a setting that gives you less control over the story.

masseffect,3d1rjv,AzertyKeys,1 point,Mon Jul 13 13:26:44 2015 UTC,"I'm talking about the Cerberus crewmen like the guys eating at the table commenting on Rupert's food or that girl on the console who used to be posted on Horizon, or that guy next to her who got his brother taken by the collectors. You don't hear anything like that by the alliance crew, sure your companions move around but the soldiers are just robots."
masseffect,3d1rjv,meshaber,1 point,Mon Jul 13 13:45:53 2015 UTC,"Well, there are a few instances of unnamed crewmen talking to your squad members, and I'm pretty sure the soldiers guarding the war room have more background dialogue than the entire C-SR2 crew put together; but sure, there may be fewer identifiable crew members. Unless you count the increased amount of dialogue, background and otherwise, by people like Adams, Kenneth and Gabby, Joker, Chakwas, Michel, Allers (ooh, there's one instance of a soldier arguing with her), Traynor and Cortez."
masseffect,3d1rjv,DuesCataclysmos,1 point,Mon Jul 13 14:09:51 2015 UTC,"Cerberus SR-2.   More ""futuristic"" and interesting than the SR-1. Also fish.  Floor layout means less elevator trips/stupid wall thing than the Alliance Normandy.  The fact that TIM was trying to suck off Shep makes all the luxury/unused floor space more sensible. I mean seriously, an open bar on an Alliance Military vessel?  I like the colors better.  The ME2 suicide mission really showed off how badass the ship was. Shrugging off debri, gutting the collector ship. Didn't really get that same feeling in ME3."
masseffect,3d1rjv,Critikle,1 point,Mon Jul 13 06:27:08 2015 UTC,Cerberus SR-2 hands down
masseffect,3d1rjv,meshaber,1 point,Mon Jul 13 07:34:35 2015 UTC,"Alliance SR2, no contest. It's larger, has a more realistic design, is prettier and more alive. The Cerberus SR2 feels like a damned hospital, not a warship. The SR1 was cool back in the day but feels so much like going back to the stone age now, especially with the way your entire crew is just... dumped in the cargo hold."
masseffect,3d1rjv,ADG12311990,1 point,Mon Jul 13 13:33:04 2015 UTC,"I loved the SR-2 in ME3. Sure, it was only halfway through the retrofit, and kinda messy, but she was nice. The CIC was a bit too dark, but nice. And having two walls for my models was nice. And the memorial wall was a nice touch."
masseffect,3d1rjv,idistaken,1 point,Tue Jul 14 01:03:46 2015 UTC,"The SR1 seems like it was designed by someone who doesn't know what limited space means. Just walk around it and notice the idiocy of the double set of stairs, the massive empty area in Engineering and the lack of bathrooms, crew quarters and storage space.  Sorry about that, SR1 lovers, but the SR2 was designed by someone who understands a ship needs to use whatever area it has to make life comfortable and easy for those living in it for months on end. The jury is out on the lower deck (another weird waste of space and an excuse to isolate Jack) but the rest of it is fine. It has showers, toilets, a lounge, an observation deck, crew quarters, a functioning kitchen, lots of storage areas and... a FAST ELEVATOR. Also, lots of portholes and windows so we can see space. Cerebrus might be assholes but they understand design and ergonomics."

masseffect,3d31rk,RANDOMSANDWICHGUY,6,Mon Jul 13 03:11:24 2015 UTC,I don't recall if you can play after you beat the game in Mass Effect 1. I usually just move onto 2 after I kill Saren. It's possible that you can't.
masseffect,3d31rk,IAmDarkridge,1 point,Mon Jul 13 03:20:27 2015 UTC,So the game just ends there?
masseffect,3d31rk,IAmDarkridge,3,Mon Jul 13 03:22:46 2015 UTC,I believe so... Again I usually never try to play after Saren so I am not 100% positive. It just sends you to the last save I think.
masseffect,3d31rk,izmirtheastarach,2,Mon Jul 13 03:25:56 2015 UTC,"OK, thanks for the reply!"
masseffect,3d31rk,CmdrPineapple,8,Mon Jul 13 03:26:42 2015 UTC,"After you defeat Saren, and then talk to the council and/or Udina and Saren, the game ends. You are likely just loading up your most recent save, which is probably the auto-save when fighting Saren.  There is no post-game state. Just the credits."
masseffect,3d31rk,AzertyKeys,1 point,Mon Jul 13 04:10:57 2015 UTC,"Yes, the credits are the end of the game."

masseffect,3d3doa,jennaberry,2,Mon Jul 13 05:17:12 2015 UTC,Is there a reason I would have to wait until ME3 or is that spoiler territory
masseffect,3d3doa,DvNull,3,Mon Jul 13 05:28:59 2015 UTC,Spoiler info probably. Basically she's not a squadie in ME2. So your interaction is limited.
masseffect,3d3doa,aoibhealfae,2,Mon Jul 13 05:42:01 2015 UTC,"There's no proper lock in in ME1. Just go back to the last save (before the last main mission you did) where you haven't talk to Ashley yet and then always talk to Liara after missions (sometimes, after side mission).   Last time I got ninjamanced by Liara because I have an extra conversation about how Shepard 'deflowered' her when the joined the first time despite flirting heavily with Kaidan. Apparently the game treated the number of conversations I had with a potential LI as preference."
masseffect,3d3doa,AzertyKeys,-2,Tue Jul 14 03:45:31 2015 UTC,"Damn... Dude you screwed up, you're supposed to go to Artemis Tau first...    The order intended for the main Missions are : Therum=>Noveria=>Virmire=>Feros. The others aren't really important but you miss a LOT by doing Therum after the others, specialy if you don't do Noveria with Liara. My recommandations ? Replay the game, it's actually quite fast if you only do the main missions, and it's worth it to have a beautiful story with Liara. Although the simplest thing you could do would be to watch Liara's romance online, export to ME2 once you finished ME1 and then edit your save to make Liara your romance instead of Ashley.    Mass effect 2 is not going anywhere, you can spare a day or two doing exactly what you want in ME1 and you may even discover some other things in the game. Ask yourself what is the worst ? ""Wasting"" a day to get the perfect story for your Shepard ? Or always having this little regret on the back of your mind ?"
masseffect,3d3doa,AzertyKeys,1 point,Mon Jul 13 06:47:46 2015 UTC,Is there a way I can alter MY specific files? Or should I download someone else's that went with Ashley? If neither I'll just replay the game cuz its actually bothering me alot
masseffect,3d3doa,AzertyKeys,2,Mon Jul 13 06:54:24 2015 UTC,"honestly dude just go replay the game, it'll be much better for you, much more enjoyable than just watching a video. Remember to talke Liara to Noveria too !    As for save editing you need Gibbed's Mass Effect 2 Save Editor, download it then open your imported Mass Effect 2 Save there will be a ""plot"" tab, in it there will be a ""Mass Effect 1"" tab then click on the Romance Tab put Liara at 6 value and Ashley at 4 Don't forget to check ""in a romance with Liara"" in the plot flags and to uncheck Ashley too.     edit: shit I forgot, you also need to reimport THIS ME2 save into a new ME2 save carreer because the game only checks plot flags at the beginning so you need to go to the ""Raw"" tab then ""plot"" then select ""lived to fight another day"" in the end mission so that the save becomes available to import into a new ME2 save, save this new save go to new game ""import from ME2 character"" and import the save.  But seriously just replay the game it'll be much better of an experience in the long run."
masseffect,3d3doa,AzertyKeys,2,Mon Jul 13 07:07:39 2015 UTC,Okay I will. I also never got Talis side quest so now I can do that
masseffect,3d3doa,AzertyKeys,1 point,Mon Jul 13 07:10:22 2015 UTC,"Tali's sidequest is done in a pretty long UNC quest where you have to destroy Geth bases on 4 planets before doing their main base, the data will be at the end of the main base. It only changes one dialogue in ME2 though, so up to you if you want to do it."
masseffect,3d3doa,AzertyKeys,1 point,Mon Jul 13 07:13:07 2015 UTC,Meaning I don't get the side quest directly from Tali herself?
masseffect,3d3doa,Soaring_Goat,1 point,Mon Jul 13 08:36:06 2015 UTC,she'll talk to you about her pilgrimage gift but once you finish the UNC quest and get the data a new quest will begin and tali will ask you for a copy of the data when you talk to her on the Normandy.    It's much less straightforward than Wrex or Garrus' quest

masseffect,3d1877,Tomzors,3,Sun Jul 12 20:01:15 2015 UTC,"That's the one.  It shoots a slug instead of pellets,  and if you fire from cover and have good Recoil - reducing gear or passives,  it's absolutely deadly even across the map. I really have out sniped snipers with it."

Mattock is love, Mattock is life.  (Seriously though, the M-22 Eviscerator has always been a favorite of mine.

masseffect,3d1clr,IAmDarkridge,2,Sun Jul 12 21:49:44 2015 UTC,I think this time limit is fairly easy to accomplish without doing side activities. You can finish Mass Effect 1 in Less than 10 hours if you rush through it. Mass Effect 2 can be super short if you avoid loyalty missions. Same with 3 if you don't care about what ending you get. Insanity generally isn't too hard except for a handful of areas. In Ranoch there is an area where you are against 3 Geth Primes which is super hard and I always die a lot.
masseffect,3d1clr,sushun,2,Sun Jul 12 18:54:38 2015 UTC,"Thanks, I'll definitely want to do some side quests though, especially the loyalty quests. Ideally I'd want to force myself to choose the loyalty quests based on who I want to survive."
masseffect,3d1clr,sushun,2,Sun Jul 12 19:09:57 2015 UTC,"That is such an interesting idea. Especially in ME3 it would add to the rushed feeling, like you need to win the war before it's too late.  I like it."
masseffect,3d1clr,Canti510,1 point,Sun Jul 12 19:05:06 2015 UTC,"I'm torn. I could cut down the time in ME3 for a feeling of desperation, but then it's the one that I normally take the longest time on.

masseffect,3d1clr,AzertyKeys,1 point,Sun Jul 12 21:45:00 2015 UTC,"I get you, ME3 is my favorite and I tend to just run around talking with people A LOT.

I've never had an ME3 run less than 40, it's hard for me to picture skipping everything not critical to the story. The completionist in me would lose his mind."

You'll find many theories, many headcannon variations of the ending of ME3 because we're left to wonder and discuss about it to achieve a feeling of ""Yeah, I think that in my opinion, that's the real ending.""  Personally, I dislike the indoctrinated theory because I don't like the feeling of my character having been controlled all along. In my mind, Shep just had a really strong will and fought off Reaper control all along, and she did survive and continued her life with Garrus by asking a favor as the savior of the galaxy, keeping the Normandy and whoever of the Alliance crew wanting to stay on board (Joker, EDI,  Chakwas, Traynor, etc...), visiting old crew members and doing some clean-up work for the Council once in a while while chilling on Rannoch because no bugs."

Shepard is only human, after all. Further, i think it would hurt more than any of the endings for it to end up being ""oh, it was all a dream because you were being mind controlled""  Of course, as other redditors have said, it's entirely up to your interpretation, that's just my .02."

It specifically references the fact that you're part synthetic, but somehow the blast doesn't kill you. I think that the blast only targeted the Reapers, but the Catalyst said it would affect all synthetics as a last-ditch attempt to continue its mission."
masseffect,3d0hjg,SilentMobius,2,Mon Jul 13 04:55:52 2015 UTC,"Firstly there is a subreddit for discussion of I.T. /r/indoctrinated  Secondly. No, I.T. is nonsense. Anyone with any actual understanding of game development can see that the ""evidence"" presented is complete bunkum.  IT didn't start the way you see it now, originally the ITers were ending haters just like a large portion of the player base at the time of the non EC ending. However there was a split between those who accepted that Bioware had simply dropped the ball big time and those who refused to believe that Bioware would do that, who refused to believe that the ending was as-presented. Slowly these people came up with reasons why ""everyone was wrong"" and ""bioware were pulling a brilliant long-con"" and that any second now they would release the real ending and everyone who took the ending at face value would be shown to be stupid and ""not real fans""  And then the EC came out, and their story changed,  Then Leviathan came out and their story changed again,  Then Citadel came out as the last DLC and the story changed yet again because they were never going to get their imaginary ""true"" ending.  Now, from my perspective IT was very useful to Bioware, because in the early days of the backlash it kept a huge chunk of the player base quiet, waiting for this supposed reveal while the remainder of the players who felt strongly were complaining bitterly. So stringing the ITers along was absolutely in Biowarr's fiscal interest.   But the fundamental thing that irritates me isn't the manipulative videos, or the shitty research, its simply that IT takes the current ending and removes it, removes all resolution, all player choice (""You didn't pick destroy LOL you lose"") and replaces it with.... Nothing, nothing at all. It takes the most heavily criticised parts of ME3 (lack of player choice, and lack or resolution) and MAKES THEM WORSE.  I have no love for the end of ME3 but IT? IT is pathetic."

masseffect,3d0hjg,Allanlemos,2,Mon Jul 13 14:17:26 2015 UTC,"The kid that only Shepard seemingly sees is the beginning of it. The dreams with the oily shadows that the Rachni eluded too when talking about being indoctrinated continue it.   Shepard's will is strong, but just think of all the face to face contact he's had with the Reapers. Being blasted by the artifact in the Arrival DLC doesn't help his case either. I'm sure he's lasted the longest out of any individual exposed, but even Shepard isn't invincible. With each loss in ME3, Shepard's will begins to shake. All the Reapers need is a crack to worm through and that's exactly what they begin to do.   To me, the ""dream sequence"" or whatever begins after the final charge to the teleporter. Harbinger shows up and not only wreaks havoc physically, but mentally, too. Once Shepard gets blasted he is at his utmost weakest and that's when the final challenge to beat the indoctrination begins, within his head. I remember someone on the comm's saying to Hackett that ""somebody made it up"" or something like that, meaning only one person made it. I think it was Anderson, and Anderson alone. If you beat the game with over 5000 galactic readiness and pick the destroy ending, you get the bonus cut scene where it shows Shepard's chest take a breath while laying in rubble. It looks like cement rubble. I'm fairly positive that the Citadel wasn't made with cement? I believe that Shepard allowed Anderson to save the day, and when you pick the ending that truly beats the indoctrination, Shepard awakes in the rubble of Harbinger's blast following Anderson's successful activation of the crucible.   The ending has always been fantastic to me because of this."

masseffect,3d0hjg,VonShnitzel,1 point,Mon Jul 13 04:58:48 2015 UTC,"I like the Indoctrination Theory, and I think it would be pretty cool if it were true, but the Extended Cut alone pretty much blows it out of the water.

Plus, it just happens to detect indoctrination right when Leng arrives, and turns to face him when mentioning it? IMO it seems really unlikely that it would do all that if it was referring to Shepard (or even if it was referring to both of them)."
masseffect,3d0hjg,bonspartan,1 point,Wed Jul 15 02:47:56 2015 UTC,Other than that the extended ending pretty much discounts it. the Prothean VI only talks to non-indoctrinated people.

masseffect,3d0hjg,Daevin,0,Sun Jul 12 18:34:09 2015 UTC,"What convinced me to believe the Indoctrination Theory is that very short sequence when the Illusive man tries to control Shepard and Shepard yells back ""Snap out of it, you can fight it!"". (Sorry if I don't recall the scene correctly, it has been long since last time I played it.)  Except Shepard is shouting directly into the camera as if he/she is talking to you, as a player behind the forth wall. Because it is Shephard's mind that is being indoctrinated and by extention you as a player.   Having some experience in filmography and visual storytelling, that scene always stood out to me and left me wondering. There's very few situations where you want the actor to look straight into the camera unless it is to talk directly to the audience behind it, breaking the forth wall. Bioware is also great at telling stories so I cannot possibly believe this to be an accident, thus it have to be intentional.   I played through the entire series after I red up on the Indoctrination Theory and I have not yet found a single sequence where any ""actor"" is looking directly into the camera, making this the only one."
masseffect,3d0hjg,Allanlemos,0,Sun Jul 12 23:48:56 2015 UTC,"I like Indoctrination Theory because it creates interesting parallels between both Shepard and Saren, but also between Shepard and the Illusive Man.  You can see Shepard going down a path similar to what Saren did in ME1, acting as a pawn without even knowing it.  The Crucible is clearly a Reaper construct, considering it uses the Citadel, a Reaper creation, and each outcome is good for the Reapers.  In Control and Synthesis, the Reapers live and supposedly reach their goal.  In Destroy, even though the Reapers are killed, I think it's pretty clear that the Reapers believe that the cycle will start again, and somebody else will create them anew.  The Refusal ending is Shepard's ""Saren's suicide"" moment when he sees the truth, breaks free, and sacrifices himself for the good of all.  Shepard's refusal to use the Crucible gives the next cycle a fighting chance to beat the Reapers with their own tech.  Additionally, imagine what the Illusive Man looks like in ME3.  After working with you in ME2, he's suddenly against you.  He's so hard-headed in thinking that Control is the best option, and he's willing to kill you if you stand in his way.  He's not doing anything in character, he's turning his soldiers into lifeless husks, something definitely not in humanity's best interest.  He used to be idealistic, but now he's just insane.  But look at Shepard from the Illusive Man's point of view.  He was just on your side during ME2, but now he's suddenly against you?  He's so hard-headed in thinking that Destroy is the best option, and he's willing to kill you if you're in his way.  He's not acting in character, especially if he just chose to save the Collector Base for you.  He used to be idealistic, but now he's gone off the deep end, doing things the old Shepard never would have done.  And why do the Reapers need to Indoctrinate them both? Simple.  When they were working together, Shepard and the Illusive Man formed a significant threat to the Reapers. Separated, each is significantly less capable, especially when they now have to fight each other in the midst of a three-way war.  So yeah, I really like Indoctrination Theory coupled with Refusal.  I think it makes the story incredibly interesting."

masseffect,3czp6a,UntamedDoge,8,Sun Jul 12 06:23:37 2015 UTC,"If I remember right from the ME2 codex, the SR2 is big enough to still be classified as a frigate but it's not supposed to be able to land on planets like the SR1 used to, it can still land on lower gravity worlds, although I think that was ignored in ME3."
masseffect,3czp6a,scotiej,7,Sun Jul 12 06:43:55 2015 UTC,From the official ME2 artbook
masseffect,3czp6a,JackofSpadesXI,3,Sun Jul 12 09:01:42 2015 UTC,"Yes, the SR-2 is supposed to be twice as big as the SR-1 (not sure about the actual dimensions since the Wiki mentions only the mass of the ship). You can read a bit more here. It is also mentioned several times in the game dialogue.  Here's also an excerpt from the codex:   With elaborate secrecy, Cerberus labored for years to build a new, superior Normandy. The vehicle's many alterations produced a craft nearly double the original size, requiring an even larger Tantalus drive core to compensate.    Full codex entry can be found here."
masseffect,3czp6a,HauntedMidget,3,Sun Jul 12 07:17:26 2015 UTC,Most estimates puts the SR-2 at about twice the size of her precursor; however I don't think there's ever been an official listing of specfications to support or debunk these claims.

masseffect,3czp6a,GildedGrizzly,3,Sun Jul 12 15:54:37 2015 UTC,"It does and I assume it may have been intended to compare their physical size, but mass could also mean that the SR-2 may just have put on a little more armor than her sister.

The Normandy SR-2 has several key differences, the most significant being that she is almost twice the mass of the original. Cerberus also designed the ship with more crew-oriented comforts by including civilian-grade accommodations (like leather chairs and a kitchen). The ship still retains the SSV Normandy SR-1's stealth characteristics. However, unlike the SR-1, the SR-2 cannot land on every planet—due to her increased mass—requiring shore parties to use a shuttle to get to a planet's surface.''"

masseffect,3cy9rh,DarkLaaw,6,Sat Jul 11 21:36:47 2015 UTC,"It depends on what kind of spoilers you are looking for. Some of the books and comics absolutely provide info that you would otherwise only receive as you played through the games. If you have a zero tolerance for spoilers, I would play the games first before experiencing any of the other media.  I read the books prior to the games they precede because I read them upon release. They don't spoil a lot, and they do set things up well. Really only Revelation reveals anything huge about the main story of the games.  But the comics definitely have a ton of background that someone might consider spoilers. There are points where you could end up getting deep background on characters you will not have met. Might be something to be especially wary of there. Most of them are basically prequel comics."
masseffect,3cy9rh,izmirtheastarach,4,Sat Jul 11 21:55:49 2015 UTC,"You should probably start with the first game but follow the chronological order other than that. Maybe avoid the Foundation series until you've played ME2 (I haven't read Foundation, but I can see it spoiling a couple of things).  Edit: Also, looking at that order some things just aren't practical. You can hardly watch the intro to Paragon Lost (it's a movie), pause and then continue with ME2, and I do suppose it could be considered spoilerific for that game."
masseffect,3cy9rh,meshaber,1 point,Sat Jul 11 22:00:10 2015 UTC,"Yeah, even the very beginning of that list is incompatible with avoiding major spoilers, since Evolution provides a backstory for a character you will not meet until ME2. I feel like treating this stuff like prequel content is the best way to go. I certainly would not have wanted that much background before I played the games."
masseffect,3cy9rh,izmirtheastarach,1 point,Sat Jul 11 23:54:55 2015 UTC,"I think some minor story spoilers will occur, but the bigger issue is that certain traits about characters could be revealed in a manner the developers didn't intend if you read the books before playing the games. Some of the emotional arcs of characters could be prematurely revealed and the emotional impact could be lessened. I say, play the games first, and then go for the other media as a way to go deeper into the characters and groups you like.   Edit* Actually, definitely play the games first. There are some major spoilers in the comics that take place before Mass Effect 2."
masseffect,3cy9rh,JesterMarcus,1 point,Sat Jul 11 23:38:53 2015 UTC,"I'd advise you to do the same thing I tell people that ask the same question about MGS: play it in the order they released. The world is built that way, things are expounded upon in later media that may or may not take place before previous installments. If you don't want to spoil anything until it happens, just play them in release order and I can 100% guarantee you that that won't happen."
masseffect,3cy9rh,DishwasherTwig,1 point,Sat Jul 11 23:58:54 2015 UTC,"I don't understand your question. If you play through the series you will progress through it thus not spoiling anything.

masseffect,3cy9rh,JacobDanielM,1 point,Sat Jul 11 21:56:01 2015 UTC,"OP, play the games first. Here's what I recommend:  Play the first ME, THEN read the bonus ME1 era content (revelations, anything else that takes place before the first game)  Then play ME2, followed by pre-ME2 additional content (like Ascension)  Then play ME3, then go for the rest of the content.

Utterly, completely enraged. I played Soldier class in ME1, and in ME2 as well, but I took the Slam ability, because I like to think Shepard was developing a liking for biotics by the end of 2. In 3, I play as Vanguard, and justify it because Shepard had six months to work on biotic combat while in detention on Earth. In my mind, the first two games followed Shepard being relatively calm and level-headed about the whole Reaper business, but seeing the first Reaper touch down on Earth behind the committee was the final straw for Shepard. Something in his mind snapped, and from that point onward everything is a whirlwind of rage, blood, guts and biotic batshittery.

There was a thread on /r/Askreddit couple of weeks ago about the best video games ever released. I had my share of that - HL series, Portal series, GTA series, etc. - and I also mentioned KotoR. I was never a big fan of Star Wars, but KotoR did not really fell Star Wars at all. And boy, the plot twists it had.  A redditor replied to my comment, saying that if I enjoyed KotoR, trying out Mass Effect is a must.  He was spot on. Because I definitely raked in like ~100-150 hours in the past weeks into ME1 and ME2 and their respective DLCs.  The depth of this game is just unreal. I honestly don't know when was the last time I felt something like this. If there ever was a time.

masseffect,3cwe84,acondie13,0,Sat Jul 11 22:10:43 2015 UTC,"Alright, possibly unpopular opinion time: people in this sub absolutely obsess about these games. They are absolutely fantastic games and I love them to death, but there are absolutely other games out there that rival this series in every aspect, albeit maybe not in a single package. If no other game has made you cry, you aren't playing the right games. The end of MGS4, the beginning of the Last of Us, both ends of inFamous 2 are a few other examples that immediately come to mind of very powerful scenes in games.   If ""games are ruined for you by ME"" then that's your problem, not really a statement on the games themselves. If you can't play anything else without comparing to to this series, that's your inability to separate them and you've associated Mass Effect too much with gaming as a whole.  This isn't necessarily a comment about you yourself, more about the fact that a large portion of what I see in this sub is ""ME is the greatest ever, it doesn't compare to X game because Y"" and it's already old after being here a day. Yes, the series is amazing, but that doesn't mean it will consume your every waking thought, there are plenty of other amazing games out there that can command the same emotive response or tell just as compelling a story, spending too much time obsessing over these does nothing but make you miss those other games as well as probably make you depressed because you've gotten too far into it and equated the story itself to your own happiness and knowing that Shepard's arc is definitively over can literally cause you to sink into depression. An extreme, yes, but with some of the posts I've seen here, it seems much more likely than other franchises.  Go check out /r/TheLastAirbender. Similar situation, the series it's based around is over for the foreseeable future with a few minor installments on the horizon. But the content continues to flow, fanart, fan stories, new outlooks of the franchise are all a daily thing there. Contrast that to here where some of the most popular posts in the past few days have been ""What's your favorite [weapon]?"" Not exactly the same quality of content. I came here expecting loads and loads of fanart, not people trying to fill a void by latching on to every minute detail and either trying to expound on it unnecessarily or just polling the fandom about them."

masseffect,3cy7ra,aoibhealfae,2,Sat Jul 11 23:03:14 2015 UTC,That is the whole romance. So you have done it.
masseffect,3cwtt8,jowlar,11,Sat Jul 11 13:42:47 2015 UTC,"It used to be critical in spinning up your readiness, which determines your effective strength at the end and thereby the ending. Now, you can just go here log in with your Origin account and spin it up with random missions.  If you start when you start playing, you should be at ~100% when you finish."
masseffect,3cwtt8,Grunt08,1 point,Sat Jul 11 13:47:17 2015 UTC,"So. When the ""deploy"" timer runs out it will permanently add the n% of the mission to galaxy at war? No need to log in to the actual ME3 game and complete the deployment I selected or something similar."
masseffect,3cwtt8,Bjens,2,Sat Jul 11 19:03:06 2015 UTC,"Pretty much, except it averages the readiness for each sector to make the whole.  (I think it might apply different percentages in proportion to the war assets you have from each race/sector.)  It used to work through a mobile app and I would just spend a few days before a playthrough sending missions out whenever I checked my phone.  It was easy to get to 100% and stay in that neighborhood until the end.  I think the increase in percentage may be permanent now, because mine's been stuck at 99% for months."
masseffect,3cwtt8,Grunt08,1 point,Sat Jul 11 19:08:02 2015 UTC,"Okay. I'll give it a shot :) not that it's necessary, I did grind MP points until I could do the ""perfect"" ending, but since I didn't know about this I guess there is nothing to lose. Thank you!"
masseffect,3cwtt8,Bjens,1 point,Sat Jul 11 20:38:36 2015 UTC,"FWIW you only need 4000 war assets to see all endings, which I think is possible to reach with the extended cut DLC and 50% readiness.   edit: wait you can only reach around 7500 assets so you'd need >53%, so you'd still have to do something outside of the game"
masseffect,3cwtt8,roomnoises,1 point,Mon Jul 13 19:34:46 2015 UTC,"So... I'm about to do Priority: Cerberus Headquarters with all the side quests on the Citadel completed, and I've been playing through Infiltrator on my iPad, which is a fucking nightmare. I know they can't do much about the controls because of the whole touchscreen thing, but oh my god, it's like trying to navigate a molasses factory with my head stuck in a wet paper bag. Anyway, my readiness is at 55% right now. How high do you think I'll be able to get it by the end of the game?  Also, what the hell do you do on that site? I'm probably just dumb, but I can't figure it out."
masseffect,3cwtt8,teuast,1 point,Mon Jul 13 19:06:59 2015 UTC,"1) Login with Origin  2) Go to the Galaxy at War tab on the left  3) There should be a segmented map of the Galaxy. You can click on each segment and send ships to perform missions that increase the readiness for that sector.  How high it goes depends on how good you are about checking on it, but the shortest missions bump you 2.8% and it takes like...15 mins.  Unfortunately, it seems whenever I click on anything it says the server is unavailable, so they may have pulled support for that feature.  If that's the case...folks might just be SOL."
masseffect,3cwtt8,Grunt08,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:11:24 2015 UTC,"Hey, it worked! Thanks, now I can just leave it in the background, check every hour and I'll be good to go. That's weird about you not being able to connect, I just got right on."
masseffect,3cwtt8,teuast,8,Mon Jul 13 20:40:05 2015 UTC,"Not even a little bit. It can boost your galactic readiness, but with all the dlc it's easy to get to 100%"
masseffect,3cwtt8,heikurashi,4,Sat Jul 11 13:53:35 2015 UTC,Before the EC multiplayer was pretty much necessary to get the best ending.  The minimum war asset count was impossible to reach without playing MP.  The EC lowered the minimum for the best ending so it was achievable without MP.
masseffect,3cwtt8,jennaberry,1 point,Sat Jul 11 13:52:23 2015 UTC,So...That's how I was able to get the best ending with only 32XX war assets?
masseffect,3cwtt8,EdumBot,4,Sat Jul 11 15:30:07 2015 UTC,I think it is 3100+ for the best.
masseffect,3cwtt8,PointyBagels,4,Sat Jul 11 15:54:16 2015 UTC,"As others have said, you no longer need to play the multiplayer even for a second to get 100% completion and the best ending in the game. That being said, if you aren't a completionist it can be a good way to get your war assets up before finishing the game.  Also, I personally love the multiplayer and have logged almost as many hours there as in the main game. It's a fairly straightforward game (desperately hoping it gets more interesting with ME:A), but playing as the various alien races is ridiculously fun. Want to be Salarian STG using your enemy's own tech to keep you alive and then appearing behind them for that deadly shot? Do it. Want to play as a Geth Prime platform sent in to support the squad with hex shields and that nasty cannon? Do it. Want to be a Krogan born for war and ready to tear through enemy ranks with nothing but your fists and your face? Do it. Honestly, the multiplayer was the main reason I was hoping for seeing multiple races in the main game since it did so much for the replayability in the multiplayer. I can certainly see the design reasons to not do that."
