Chattanooga,3e2ffv,boobastank,22,Tue Jul 21 13:03:30 2015 UTC,Free parking on nights and weekends is one of my favorite things about downtown Chattanooga. Saturday parking makes me sad.

Of the increases, for me personally, meter rates are less annoying than 6PM and Saturdays. Unintended consequences? I can imagine a change from 4:30 to 6:00 will annoy some people enough that they'll go elsewhere for dinner.   The fees go toward parking infrastructure and technology upgrades   I'd like to see them take a more free-market approach and pay for infrastructure and technology upgrades with increased efficiency resulting from those upgrades."

You can always park with them instead of the city, just costs you anywhere from $2 to $6 dollars more than the city parking and it is never free, ever. And NONE of the proceeds pay for any infrastructure upgrades. YAY! Free market!"
Chattanooga,3e2ffv,kaypeedee,2,Tue Jul 21 21:44:22 2015 UTC,You've misunderstood my statement/concept (or twisted its meaning). I encourage you to re-read it with an a open mind.
Chattanooga,3e2ffv,chredit,2,Tue Jul 21 21:56:25 2015 UTC,I re-read it and still don't understand what you are trying to say.   Republic parking is a free market approach.   Paying for infrastructure upgrades through increased efficiency? This makes no sense. Please explain.
Chattanooga,3e2ffv,kaypeedee,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:22:22 2015 UTC,"I don't know the specifics of these ""upgrades"". I can make an assumption about infrastructure, but it's easier to give an example that relates to technology.  When I need a parking space, I don't care about new tech...I just want a place to park. In the absence of some new feature, there should be a monetary benefit to justify the expense. If the new tech reduces operating cost through improved efficiency (e.g. reduced manpower, improved enforcement rate, etc.), the cost savings of the efficiency improvement should exceed the expense of the technology over some period of time (return on investment).  Judging by your previous reply, you seem to have demonized the phrase ""a more free-market approach"". What I meant by ""free-market approach"" is the above example, and NOT to privatize meters."
Chattanooga,3e2ffv,chredit,1 point,Wed Jul 22 01:57:15 2015 UTC,I don't think you really understand what the term free-market means.
Chattanooga,3e2ffv,kaypeedee,2,Wed Jul 22 03:03:17 2015 UTC,Republic and CPA are the same company. Free market thinking led to the decision to outsource our parking enforcement. Thanks Littlefield.
Chattanooga,3e2ffv,godisevol,2,Tue Jul 21 22:09:25 2015 UTC,Really? So why are the meters so much cheaper than the republic lots? The city must still control the pricing structure of on-street parking?
Chattanooga,3e2ffv,kaypeedee,3,Tue Jul 21 22:23:25 2015 UTC,"From the CPA website:  ""CPA contracts with Republic Parking of Chattanooga to manage and maintain the parking garages, surface lots and on street metered spaces and equipment. Revenue generated from these public parking spaces helps CARTA operate and maintain the free downtown electric shuttle system and manage, maintain and these parking resources.""  I'm sure CARTA controls it to a certain degree, but pricing decisions are most likely based on what Republic deems the operating cost to be. Whatever the case it's always more expensive to outsource jobs/services like this than to have it be governmentally run."
Chattanooga,3e2ffv,godisevol,11,Tue Jul 21 22:30:17 2015 UTC,Yes and how much of this increase is motivated simply a desire by Republic Parking to make more profit?

Chattanooga,3e2ffv,DracoSolon,5,Tue Jul 21 16:30:53 2015 UTC,They've already made drastic improvements to the meters around town allowing for credit cards and/or mobile payment. I can't count the number of times I've had to find parking elsewhere because I didn't have quarters for the meter. Now it's not a problem at all.
Chattanooga,3e2ffv,n0ia,2,Tue Jul 21 19:11:48 2015 UTC,I can't see why the city would be incentivized to increase the profits of Republic. I can easily see why the city would have a huge incentive to improve downtown infrastructure in order to capitalize on the growth of downtown tourism.  I'm curious about what past actions by the city make you believe they would rather bolster Republic profits than invest in the city. Are there particular cases of corruption in the city government or heavy corporate lobbying on behalf of Republic that I'm unaware of?
Chattanooga,3e2ffv,dirkbently,4,Tue Jul 21 17:22:04 2015 UTC,"Sucks for me since I don't live or work downtown. But I might feel differently if I saw cars parked in the same spot all day on a saturday, while paying customers have to drive around forever looking for a spot."

As we continue to brand ourselves as a ""destination"" city, we should take full advantage by making more money from tourists and folks outside of the city proper, who are often here on Saturdays.   The arguments in the article for the increase seem valid. The city has been growing quickly, and there hasn't been a rate increase since 1998. I can't/don't want to take the time to back this up with facts, but I'm assuming this is mostly to simply offset inflation.    The fees go toward parking infrastructure and technology upgrades, he also said.   I think it's really important for the city to continue to upgrade infrastructure and tech, otherwise our rate of population growth will overwhelm us and we'll face bigger troubles trying to catch up from behind. Something like that happened in Asheville and they are facing big issues with downtown parking and infrastructure."

The city has been growing quickly, and there hasn't been a rate increase since 1998.   It says in the article, there was in increase in 2008. Prior to that increase, it was increased in 1998.

Having to stoop down to use an awful UI that takes minutes instead of seconds. And then having to go BACK and put the slip on the dash.

They have declared war on the citizens of free society, of which I am one. This girl has joined ranks with ISIS. This makes her dangerous and an enemy of free people everywhere. These people kill innocent people everyday. They bring misery to the world and foster hate and evil. Yes, I hope they're annihilated. As much as I think it was OK to annihilate the Nazis in the 1940s.  Yes, I hope the enemies of peace and freedom on the world are eliminated.

Yes, not only do I think she deserves to die, but I hope she does, quickly.  These people have declared war on us.  Not our country, but you and I.  They would go into shopping malls and execute anyone they can.  They do want to kill us.  I hope to God, each and everyone of them dies a horrible death before something like what happened ed last week happens again. We don't live in a world if fairy tales, dreams, and idealistic bullshit.

But when you do replace it, consider getting a reinforced strike-plate - that's the metal part on the door frame that the deadbolt goes into.  A good one should come with screws that are at least 3 inches - long enough to go through the door frame and into the wall stud.  Attaching to the stud makes it much harder for someone to kick the door in.  Also, the taller the strike plate the better because that means more screws to more firmly attach it to the stud.  Here's a random blog I googled up with good pictures illustrating what I am talking about."

Get lots of floodlights (either motion sensor ones or ones that come on at night and stay on all night). Make sure you use LED bulbs because they last forever. I'd suggest a security system too if you don't have one. I got one after my first break-in and the siren scared them off when they tried to break in the second time. Start leaving random lights on all the time when you're not home (LEDs are great for this too). It'll hopefully make it look like someone is home and might make your house a less attractive target.   As for the door, I'm sorry but I don't know who to call for that. Possibly your insurance company? They might send someone out.

As for a local place to eat, I've got to suggest Larry's.  As a disclaimer, it's a business owned by my family, but we are the #1 restaurant on TripAdvisor in Trenton.    http://www.larrysbuffet.com/  http://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g35320-d394513-Reviews-Larry_s_Restaurant-Trenton_Georgia.html  I also suggest Thatcher's for BBQ and maybe Lalito's for Mexican cuisine, though it's the Mexican food you can get anywhere.  Someone else suggested Canyon Grill, which is the 'high end' of food in the county.  It's very good, but you definitely pay for it.  Check out the Drive-In Theater if you are into watching a movie on your trip.  Spend a morning hiking Cloudland Canyon, if you can.    After that, you'll have to go to Chattanooga for pretty much everything else.  If you have any questions about that area, I'll be happy to help.  Edit: I see you're from Austin.

Beyond that, inattentive office staff. They'll often take looooong lunches, leaving you unable to check your packages or pay rent or make a maintenance request. The office lady is very, unabashedly racist. They've been ""renovating"" since the property got purchased, which consisted of painting all outsides of the buildings gray. Also, shittily repaving the parking lot. And whenever they do this shitty maintenence, they don't alert you in any way. They used to send out emails, but they stopped pretending to know was happening on any given day after the 1 week paving job consumed 3 weeks. Parking is horrendous.  They once sent out an email survey asking how much more per month would we theoretically pay for all black appliances. Our dishwasher just didn't work at all and was also already black. There was no option for 0 dollars, but there was the option to write it in yourself. Not sure what they we're hoping for with that blank.  However, at the time, it was 620 including water really close to downtown, so honestly I don't regret much. Now they're something like 800. If you find yourself looking seriously for an apartment there or anywhere else in Chattanooga, always look at the exact, completed apartment before signing anything, and for the love of god know how to check for bugs. Does the counter look like it has fine coffee grounds on it, most likely along the edges? Bug poop. Check every possible place for cracks in the wall, especially under cabinets, in closets, and and place pipes meet a wall, especially the bathroom and washer dryer hook ups.

One guy said ""christian fundies dont blow people up and shoot people to death!""  to which I replied a link to Eric Rudolphs wikipedia.

I spent the better part of the last 48 hours trying to get people to understand that no matter who's ass was in the Oval Office, no matter the color of said ass, no matter the amount of training or weaponry, there is no way this could have been predicted.   I spent the better part of 48 hours trying to explain that not every body enjoys STREET PREACHING, and basically hearing the local news channels Facebook page comments printed out and shouted at them, like a script, and being told their doomed to damnation if they don't get right with God or rise up against the treasonist Moslem usurper Obama, especially at a FUCKING MEMORIAL for 5 dead service men. I mean, call me crazy, but it WAS religion that caused all this. As I said on said Facebook page, if one of these servicemen were one of MY relatives, I would have a hard time sitting by while some Christian fundie walked up and down the thoroughfare shouting religious drivel at people and waving his bible in their face. In the video that I saw, the guy sounded just like Westboro baptist, just not as vulgar and trollish. And the attitudes of the people that subscribe to it. Good grief. It's enough to make your head hurt. One person had the nerve to tell the man that that wasn't the place to politicize or proselytize. And the sheeple? ""How dare that man! It's this preachers obligation to spread the word? Where else  could a child of God or man of the word of God find so many people in one setting who need to hear the truth? And it's absolute truth!"" One lady said "" that man who told him this wasn't the place will surely burn in hell lest he asks for forgiveness"".   These are the people who live amongst us and make up this city.

But don't sit here and blame ME and accuse ME of being snarky and condescending by simply posting what's meant as a satirical article that SOMEONE ELSE WROTE (apparently I'm not the only one who notices this sad trend) that unfortunately, given the current state of events, is sounding more and more like legit news everyday, lest you prove this FAKE article, especially the last lines, true."

You took this tragedy as a way to posture your own intelligence, and I think that's lame.  Here's the question: did you change anybody's mind on Facebook when you argued with them? I'm going to venture to say that you didn't. Not one single one. So you and these other people, bickering back and forth about who's more politically enlightened, step on the bodies of the fallen to create a platform for your own politics.  It's disgusting."

But this isn't about Islam vs America, that's what so many people are trying to twist this into. This was  about a mentally disturbed man who made bad decisions. It wasn't ISIS. It wasn't because Muslims kill every infidel and are a plague on the nation. This was one man, who happened to have a particular faith over the other. Some people rant and rave about how Islam is the world's worst religion and never think about alllllllll the atrocities people have committed for the name of Christianity. They care more about hating a culture they only have a twisted perception of. People do bad things for lots of bad reason. I don't blame Islam. I blame the man who pulled the trigger. That's all OP, and a lot of other people are trying to say."
Chattanooga,3dvx59,godisevol,-2,Mon Jul 20 15:18:52 2015 UTC,"I'll respond to you since your response was well thought out and kind. I don't find any type of criticism with OP's viewpoints. As a matter of fact, I agree with them. What I see, however, is a bunch of people posturing and clamoring to use this tragedy as a platform to further their own political viewpoints. OP and the people he/she's arguing against are all arguing on the backs of 5 dead service people. I think it's in poor taste, and I wish OP would understand that.  Further confounding that fact is OP's general tone and snarkiness. I think that a bit of tact would serve him/her well. Yes, I understand the irony and inherent hypocrisy in my statement since I've been pretty abrasive also, but sometimes you have to call a spade a spade. OP was being just as big of an inconsiderate jerk as the people he/she was arguing against. Ultimately, it does a disservice to the people who lost their lives in this senseless attack.  OP's righteous indignation at my attack just further illustrates his or her own inflated sense of self importance."
Chattanooga,3dvx59,612WolfAvenue,2,Mon Jul 20 15:54:50 2015 UTC,"I think OP and the people they were arguing against the people who initially used this tragedy to push their own agenda. ""Muslim person kills 4 Marines and a Sailor; ISIS IS EVIL AND MUSLIMS ARE GONNA KILL EVERYONE."" I don't see OP as trying to push any kind of agenda, but in fact diffuse a situation where people are in fact, using this as an excuse to spew hate and ignorance.   A tragedy like this should spark some debate. Whether it be gun laws, security, what ever you want to. I think it wouldn't do us any good to just be sad and move on. OP never meant any disrespect to any of the victims, and while I didn't know anyone involved, I don't see how OPs comments were disrespectful to anyone but those ignorant people who refused to listen. I mean, how does it make you feel when you see people claiming this is all Islams fault? It makes me pretty angry to see people throwing accusations at religion instead of understanding this was preformed by a sick individual. That may not be an excuse to lose your cool, but when you spend so much time and effort trying to get these people to just listen to you, it's fucking frustrating. You can't argue with a brick wall. You're just going to end up getting yourself hurt.  However, I will say. I understand that you don't wanting to argue on the backs of people you knew who recently passed. But, here we all are arguing. A spade is a spade, but it's hard for a spade to take another spade seriously when they're criticizing them for being a spade. I know you aren't trying to disrespect anyone, and I know I'm not. But I think this is a good example of how people can have a discussion that stems from it's original points. I may not agree with what you're saying chromedizzle, but I don't believe it's disrespectful to the service members who recently lost their life for us to get mad at other people in arguments."
Chattanooga,3dvx59,chromedizzle,-2,Mon Jul 20 16:21:10 2015 UTC,"Here's the thing; I understand what OP is trying to do. I really do. I understand what the people on the other side are trying to do. I think it's disgusting on all sides, and it really only tarnishes the memory of the people who died so tragically to turn their death into a parody and absurd personal posturing.  I actually was trying to disrespect OP, because I felt that he/she was worthy of disrespect. I also think that the people trying to make this about Islam or ISIS or whatever are also worthy of being disrespected. The reason is because the arguments and the rhetoric on both sides is disrespectful to the fallen.  What I find most offensive about OP, is that he/she had an argument with ""friends"" on Facebook. The argument is the direct result of 5 innocent people being brutally murdered. Then, OP decides to come onto Reddit to brag about his ""putting right wing fundies in their place"" for internet points. I find it pretty pathetic, and worthy of derision. Again, it's selfish, immature, and disrespectful of the fallen."
Chattanooga,3dvx59,612WolfAvenue,4,Mon Jul 20 16:36:25 2015 UTC,"And it's disrespectful to call for the murder of innocents based on the actions of one individual which is what 95% of the people on FB are doing. If you so badly want to criticize someone it should be the arrogant christians spouting their xenophobic, ammosexual garbage all over everything.   OP did nothing wrong in this situation, but to me it looks like you used your direct relationship with one of the deceased to try and win argument and that's pretty low."
Chattanooga,3dvx59,bokkasrealm,3,Mon Jul 20 16:53:14 2015 UTC,"So, you are being rude on purpose and disrespecting other people who did it first, because they ""did it first."" I commend OP for trying to spread understanding and some tolerance instead of blind hate.   You are just being a disrespectful hypocrite.   I actually was trying to disrespect OP  I find it pretty pathetic, and worthy of derision. Again, it's selfish, immature, and disrespectful of the fallen.   I don't have anything else to say to you."

I still work in ooltewah but  now live in Cleveland (20 minute drive) because cost of living is so low and lots of places from nice downtown lofts to little houses etc. the downside is I'm about 40 minutes from downtown Chattanooga where I frequent for work sometimes.   DM me for my landlords number if you want to look in Cleveland. I'm living in a 3 bedroom house with my wife for $650.

Chattanooga,3dqgfs,Geolosopher,8,Sat Jul 18 17:17:31 2015 UTC,"I believe some media outlets have reported the attack as domestic terrorism. I think they're being cautious on how to approach it, or at least until the investigation is further along. FBI and the Feds are involved, so it's no longer a local law enforcement matter. Plus, it doesn't sound like a terrorist organization has come forward to claim responsibility, indicating a lone wolf attack.  That being said, I think a random hate-shooting against military personnel constitutes terrorism, whether or not it is religiously motivated or supported by a known terrorist organization. Looking at purely the known facts, maybe it's a bit premature to label it as true terrorism, but the vague details known do point to it being religiously motivated."
Chattanooga,3dqgfs,buster_boo,3,Sat Jul 18 14:42:56 2015 UTC,"The FBI guy said at the press conference yesterday that while they are not calling it an act of terrorism, they are definitely treating the investigation as one.

Chattanooga,3dqgfs,jcwright610,2,Sat Jul 18 20:59:51 2015 UTC,And that may be the case. Still feels like terrorism despite any legal classification. The crime was intended to terrorize and victimize innocents.  But you do raise a very valid point!

Chattanooga,3dl4ml,ghost-from-tomorrow,5,Fri Jul 17 13:27:43 2015 UTC,"He attended a few Friday prayers there recently after a hiatus based on the Imam's statements to the NYT, but he may have attended multiple mosques during the same period. Mosques don't really work the same way as churches or synagogues. People don't necessarily ""belong"" to the congregation.   E.g. Muslim works in the city, but lives in the suburbs. They would attend a mosque in city and the suburbs at different times of the day/week and may not even know anyone personally at either.   So sure he prayed at the mosque, but it doesn't appear that he was involved/affiliated with the community outside of showing up for a weekly Friday prayer."

I was under the impression that the majority of the local Muslim population are affiliated with ISGC.  (Note: Don't get me wrong, I don't think that Mohammad was even remotely affiliated with ISGC. That's not the reason for my question, just generally curious. Most of my experience with American Islam stems from experiences in northern Ohio, which had a large Sudanese population), which was a somewhat different culture from the religiously charged south. Overall, from my experience the ISGC community is a very progressive group and the few ""members"" I've met who are great people.)"

The truth is, a lot of people are scared, and our media is not helping to portray mainstream Islam in a way that will abate people's fears. It's crucial that everyone sees the Islamic community in Chattanooga is suffering alongside everyone else. We need a sense of solidarity, and this statement is definitely working toward that end.   If someone committed a similar atrocity in the name of Jesus Christ, it would be just as pertinent for the Christian community to come out and condemn that individual. We should all be held to the same standards in our community, and everything we do should be in the name of calming fears and helping one another through this tragic event, not spewing vitriol and hate at one another. This statement is the first step of that process, imo.

I think in some ways that quote sheds light on the fact that its true, if you are told you are the enemy enough growing up you might just become it.

Chattanooga,3dfsjo,Consta135,3,Wed Jul 15 22:48:27 2015 UTC,"Is there somewhere for us to read the things they're voting on? I know how to find the congressional bills, but not one single story I've read has actually brought up specifically what the bill and the amendment say."
Chattanooga,3dfsjo,WeeferMadness,3,Thu Jul 16 00:24:57 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure. I saw this on the news last night and looked for it today. What I remember last night was it was sexual and gender identity protection for government workers, and they added a religious amendment to it and then took out the gender identity protections I think. I will try and find exactly what the vote is for."

Chattanooga,3dfsjo,WeeferMadness,3,Thu Jul 16 00:52:45 2015 UTC,"That PDF makes it pretty clear. All it says is leave people alone, and don't be a dick. Why would someone want to take the gender identity part out of that? That makes no sense. No ones religion is being infringed, no one is being forced to do anything other than act like a normal, civilized person. Yet here they are wanting to add religious protections? That's ridiculous. The idea that ""Don't be a dick"" infringes on someones religion is insane."
Chattanooga,3dfsjo,JimWilliams423,2,Thu Jul 16 01:01:05 2015 UTC,"The main argument for that is the bathroom argument.

Chattanooga,3dfsjo,WeeferMadness,2,Thu Jul 16 01:06:04 2015 UTC,"Honestly I think they're more scared of having to use the bathroom with transmen themselves than anything. They're likely just using ""womens rights"" as a smoke screen. I've worked with douchebags in the past who (at the age of 40+) would literally run away from gay men they ran across in public. It's pathetic.  That last link is the one to bookmark. Those are just the ones that passed, however. You'll probably have to wait a week or two before this one shows up. It would be nice for rejected and proposed bills to be available, but that seems kind of far fetched for a city as small as Chattanooga. Hell, I wouldn't even expect the big cities to be quite that transparent.  Here's a good resource for Tn state legislation, and here's one for federal. Knowing exactly what the bills actually say is very helpful when you start hearing things in the news. Knowing how individuals voted for those things is the only way to make an informed choice of who to vote for."

I know we aren't Nashville but the demand to live downtown right now is very strong, people want to live in the city, not commute and have a strong urban neighborhood!

It kinda sucked at the time because everything I needed to run a household was in Tiftonia or Hixson.  It is different now, but if Chattanooga is to sustain a larger downtown population that includes families they need to get more non ""boutique"" retailers in downtown proper.  Believe it or not I remember as a child in the 70's you could get practically anything downtown.  It was much more pedestrian friendly back then.  Of course the popular movement out to the Burbs (the more things change the more they stay the same) killed everything in downtown.

Having said that, I went through absolute hell with Comcast in an apartment - I'd never even consider them again after how I was treated. I went without cable and internet for a month and a half when I was moving out simply because I didn't want to give them another dime.

Now, of course you and I could have two entirely different definitions of what ""scum of the earth lowlifes"" means and it appears we do, but basically teenagers and kids will be teenagers and kids when unsupervised.

Chattanooga,3d16ba,ShelbySue9109,2,Mon Jul 13 17:55:50 2015 UTC,Not talking about the teenagers.  Teenagers are going to do what they do.  I suppose I owe an explanation.  The people I am talking about are the folks who live in that area who do nothing at all to contribute to society.  They flock to depressed areas like Red Bank.  The ones who make bad choice after bad choice for decades.  The ones who pull on door handles on parked cars to see if they are unlocked with goodies.  They take advantage of everyone offering help to them with no offer of return.  Put a play toy in the back of a pickup truck in any parking lot of Red Bank.  Leave it there overnight.  It will disappear every single time.  It isn't me being overly dramatic either.  Here is an example of the type of person I am talking about.  The McDonalds in Red Bank had to put a 2 foot by 2 foot sign on every entrance telling people that they have to actually buy new cups for fountain drinks as opposed to bringing in the same ole cup off the floorboard every visit.  Who does this?  The people I am talking about above is who.  Red Bank just has a disproportionate amount when compared to anywhere else on that side of the Tennessee River.  Don't get me wrong.  There are some good people there.  It is just human nature to look at only the bad apples ignoring all the good ones.

Chattanooga,3d16ba,kaypeedee,2,Sun Jul 12 18:57:11 2015 UTC,"That sort of thing is a labor of love.  Unfortunately you are unlikely to ever see evidence of all the good you've done because it is kids benefiting in their homes.  It is hard to keep going when the only reinforcement you get is negative.  That's totally normal human nature.   The best advice I've got for you personally is to envision the difference you are making.  If you are able to inspire even just one child to go to college when they would have otherwise become a high-school dropout, that is a profoundly good thing, both for the child and the community they live in.  One thing you might do, if you haven't already, is to make sure each book contains a nicely formatted, but brief, notice inside the front cover explaining what a LFL is and the borrower's responsibilities, including encouraging them to contribute books too."

Chattanooga,3cx6gk,Shovelware_,1 point,Sun Jul 12 19:47:27 2015 UTC,How does a tank get contaminated? (empty and valve open perhaps?)   Lubricants on the valves that make there way into the lines.  People who aren't using it for beverages or medical purposes have little reason to care about that.
Chattanooga,3cx6gk,JimWilliams423,2,Sun Jul 12 20:34:05 2015 UTC,"Holston Gas does technically have the cheapest fill, but they also only fill it 3/4 of the way and require you to use their tanks on a rotating basis. So your shiny new rig with brand new fittings and gaskets becomes theirs forever and you get one that looks like it was found on the road. Note that this isn't a terrible deal if you genuinely don't give a crap about this and getting a new rig each time doesn't make you twitchy; they're generally pretty good about testing the pre-filled containers (no waiting around) and, if one should leak, they're generally pretty good about reimbursing you.  One of the places I go is Chattanooga Fire Protection on Broad. They'll fill your 5 lb. tank for around $15, not sure about the cost for a 10 lb. Not the very cheapest, but there are surprisingly few options for this sort of thing around town."

Chattanooga,3cuuwt,Baadgerbait,9,Fri Jul 10 23:32:31 2015 UTC,"My experience- It is as simple as this-   Weekend drivers and Weekday drivers.  Weekday drivers are used to pedestrians as they are downtown workers and also pedestrians as soon as they park their car and walk to work or lunch. They know they don't need to run anyone over. Weekday drivers are So Much More Patient.  Weekend drivers downtown are clueless to people on foot. Absolutely fucking clueless. They are downtown looking for a goddamm parking space for free in front of wherever they are going. Right on red while yielding to foot traffic? Head up my ass? Whatever. Get the fuck out of my way. Gridlock? Hey- the light was green when I stopped and blocked the fucking intersection. Let me 'peel' out for making me wait assholes on foot.   I have lived in downtown Chattanooga for going 19 years and have also spent a LOT of time in an apartment in urban Chicago. Honestly- I see the same up there (or any city)  People often ask me about living where I do and my number #1 complaint is weekend drivers.   AND weekend Pedestrians.   Just today I saw someone use a curb cut to park on a sidewalk then walk toward Nightfall.   Mon-Fri No horns, less assholes.     Sat-Sun HONK HONK HONK, assholes times ten  In Manhattan- it's an effect called 'the bridge and tunnel crowd'.  That all being said- If a pedestrian enters a crosswalk on a flashing red they better bust a move to clear the intersection you deserve to get the brush by. There is a quid pro quo.   Weekend pedestrians are 100% as bad as weekend drivers. A 'do not walk' and a green light might mean there is an arrow giving cars a protected turn across your sidewalk.   YES I know pedestrians have the right a way. But if a car is maneuvering for a parking space or a curb cut have some common hospitality and don't lead whole the family around the back of a car and the driver's blind spot. Ben & Jerry's will still be there.  TL;DR My apologies Lex. I feel your pain. Sadly its not just a Chattanooga problem in my experience."

Overall, I've had more drivers unnecessarily yield to me at crosswalks than not.  However, drivers turning can sometimes not notice because they are usually watching out for vehicular traffic.  As a pedestrian, I do my part to stay safe and make sure the drivers have seen me if I do cross when they may otherwise be preoccupied watching for vehicular traffic.  While it is the driver's legal obligation (usually) to not run over me, it's my obligation to make sure I don't put myself in danger of being run over.

Beautiful drive through the mountains too. But it is kinda like Chattanooga Jr, so if you need something different, I'd recommend Savannah, GA. It's a great town, plus it's not too far from the ocean so you can still go down there for like a day without having to actually stay at the ocean your whole trip. Tybee Island is my favorite beach near there."
Chattanooga,3cql77,oshoney,3,Fri Jul 10 00:19:00 2015 UTC,"Hey thanks! I thought about Savannah. I've never been there but from what I understand it's old (I love history) but yet has some grounding in art. Although, that's kind of what I'm trying to get away from for the moment. I don't know much about Tybee Island but you gave me a reason to check it out. Thanks again!  EDIT: After perusing through some more info, you might have just hit the danged ol' nail on the head.

Inexpensive hotel rates, too, since it's not very touristy. Not much to do except sun and day drink, and some neat little local dives to eat.  Oh, yeah- there's a Waffle House at the end of the island if you get homesick! 😊"

The drive is nice, the food options are so plentiful and high-quality that it puts most cities to shame, and if you're downtown you can just stroll around and duck into bars and shuck a few oysters, or have a great gourmet breakfast for lunch, or whatever.

(Riverstreet deli if you like deli sandwhiches, tacos at the new taco joint. Taco Mamacita is good. Nikki's is a classic chattanooga burger joint that has been around for a long time. Plenty more to chose from.   If you have not done the riverwalk and are new to town and she likes to walk or ride bikes... ask her to show you. I'd recommend starting in coolidge and crossing the walking bridge. Turn left, go past the Hunter and head on up as far as you like."

Cross the river to Ross' Landing (currently under construction. Be careful) and then paddle upstream towards the Island in the middle of the river. If you head up between the Hunter Art Musem bluff and the island you will notice lots of wildlife. Turtles, ducks, herrons, and maybe a beaver if you are lucky..  The real treat is when you get to the top of the island. Look up in the trees on your left and look for the herron nests. In the spring they had babies in the nests that you could see from the river. At the very end of the island is a pole with a platform on it. That is an osprey nest. two weeks ago either a baby Osprey or a female was sitting in the nest.   Bonus points if you bring binoculars with you so she can get a good view."

Stringers Ridge has several trails that all loop. You could turn it into a pretty long excursion if you wanted.   You would need to call Trek and find out rates and such beforehand. I do not know those things... but if you look let me know because I have been considering doing it. I do know that if you rent from trek it counts towards buying a bike from them...

Side note: I had a friend of a friend had her car stolen here. There is a guard shack @ the front entrance, but there hasn't actually been anyone in there for a few weeks.   Side note 2: I've heard miserable things about the management.   But for the price, it's not so bad."

Chattanooga,3cm3s5,MusikLehrer,1 point,Thu Jul 9 19:56:59 2015 UTC,It depends on the apartment. I'm in one of the town houses and it's pretty good for the price and location. We haven't had any real issuses living there over two years. Plus maintenance has been reliable so far. I have heard the water pressure is crummy in a lot of the complex though.
Chattanooga,3cm3s5,612WolfAvenue,1 point,Thu Jul 9 03:52:13 2015 UTC,"I had a couple friends that lived there, I thought it was nice and the neighbors seemed friendly, and they never said anything bad about it.

Chattanooga,3cm3s5,sfwlurker,1 point,Fri Jul 10 13:29:47 2015 UTC,"My boyfriend and I just moved into Signal View. Aside from issues being accepted into the complex, we haven't had any issues. We're also in the newer apartments, if that makes a difference."
Chattanooga,3cm3s5,ShelbySue9109,1 point,Sat Jul 11 04:03:12 2015 UTC,"I've been at Signal View for almost a year now - I don't mind it too terribly, but let me offer you a few warnings.    First, there is a clause in the lease where the tenant is required to give the office a 60 day intent to vacate notice, if you're planning on leaving when your lease is up. This is pretty standard, however, they will not necessarily remind you.  If you forget to file this, they (and by they, I mean the complex manager) will try to get you to sign a 3-month lease in order to cover that 60 days.  Keep in mind, you do still need to file an official intent to vacate, but you only need to sign month to month if you catch it early enough.  Don't let them talk you into a longer contract if you don't want that.  Second, there's really two sides of Signal View - the student townhouses and the family apartments further back in the complex.  If you're a student or a young professional that doesn't mind people getting loud on some weeknights, those older student townhouses are fine.  But if you're on a regular schedule where you need to be up early, just know that there have been several nights where there's banging around and parties and stuff at 3 or 4 in the morning.  The walls are pretty thin in the older apartments, so it's kind of hard to get away from that.  That said, it's not terrible, but it's something to keep in mind.  As far as what everyone else has mentioned, yeah, there's good parking, management can be pretty frustrating and the security guard is there like 3 days a week, max.  If you like to work out, the workout area is pretty sparse but never crowded, and the pool is nice enough.    So in summary, like I mentioned before, if you're a student or on the younger side and you are looking for a relatively cheap, comfortable place, it's not that bad.  But if you can afford to, or don't want to deal with shifty management or loud neighbors, I'd try somewhere else.  edit: I realize that all these points are from a renter's standpoint, but even if you're looking to own, I think these are some good points to know."

Chattanooga,3cghud,kthehun89,-4,Tue Jul 7 22:55:16 2015 UTC,"No, not really. I've been to Japan. The speaker's saying ""bone sigh"" when it's more like ""bon zai"". You can hear pronunciation from native speakers here."
Chattanooga,3cghud,TooSunny,4,Wed Jul 8 01:03:15 2015 UTC,"I've been to Japan quite a few times, and my Japanese bonsai teacher Johnny Uchida calls it as such, so I'm sticking with it."
Chattanooga,3cghud,kthehun89,-11,Wed Jul 8 01:09:56 2015 UTC,"LOL. I'll never understand how stubborn some Redditors can be.  I gave you link, with real recordings of actual Japanese people pronouncing the word, and you're still going to stand by your ignorance.  Well, I apologize. Clearly, all native Japanese people are wrong and your friend in Tennessee is the only person who knows how to speak ""real"" Japanese. I hope he was a better bone-sigh teacher than he was a Japanese teacher..."
Chattanooga,3cghud,TooSunny,4,Wed Jul 8 01:26:23 2015 UTC,"Did you really not listen to these pronunciations? You just proved my point. Listen to the males pronunciation, so clear there is no Z. You lose"
Chattanooga,3cghud,kthehun89,3,Wed Jul 8 01:45:47 2015 UTC,"Dude, the difference is minimal. Plus my friends in Hokkaido definitely don't add the z.  I'm not stubborn, I just don't give a fuck what you, another random redditor, is trying to convince me of... For real, you're telling a guy doing this for a good while.  And Google Johnny. He's not in Tennessee, don't know where you got that. He's only a Japanese guy, don't trip"

You just can't get over the fact that I'm right, am confident in your failure indoors, and have far nicer things than you could ever fart at indoors.  You come across super childish trying to fight this. You admitted that your focus is keeping things alive. For the last time, you will never create a bonsai from something struggling to live. You aren't learning anything worth while like you try and convince yourself you are.   Seriously you don't even want to follow our subs rules. No respect for you, child  And you call me arrogant? You're the idiot trying to do indoors and holding to it. Arrogant and disrespectful to our trees. Shame on you"
Chattanooga,3cghud,kthehun89,-4,Wed Jul 8 03:24:37 2015 UTC,"Yikes, projection much?

If you don't want people to be rude to you, than stop being rude to everyone else while acting like a immature douchebag."
Chattanooga,3cghud,TooSunny,3,Wed Jul 8 03:37:03 2015 UTC,You clearly have no reading comprehension
Chattanooga,3cghud,kthehun89,-4,Wed Jul 8 03:42:23 2015 UTC,"You are an arrogant asshole.  For one second forget about bonsai (I know its all you have going for you but just try for one sec).    You are arrogant! And have very limited social skills.  People on this sub dont like you, they tolerate you.  Get that? Tolerate!   You are constantly comparing me to you, I dont want to be anything like you! I dont care about you or what you can do! Get that? Im here to speak to regular people that have respect for others.  Youre clearly a very insecure individual that derives significant self worth from bonsai and anyone that does things differently is a threat.  Im sorry but its pathetic."
Chattanooga,3cghud,ItsBob_Loblaw,5,Wed Jul 8 03:37:31 2015 UTC,Good job this shit isn't going down on /r/bonsai I'd have deleted all of it from both of you.
Chattanooga,3cghud,small_trunks,4,Wed Jul 8 11:51:45 2015 UTC,"Hahah alright whatever you say!  Haters gonna hate. I can quote you're jealousy. Fuck off hater. You will never have indoor bonsai stop crying about that.   This was never anything more than that. You just are too arrogant to accept that.   You have no idea who I am or what I do. You're just clearly angry that I'm right and you're wrong, and I've told you several times. Your tree will be dead"
Chattanooga,3cghud,kthehun89,-6,Wed Jul 8 03:40:25 2015 UTC,"Again, this isnt about bonsai any longer.  Youre too delusional to get past that because BONSAI IS ALL YOU HAVE! Well that and three study groups!! Ahaha  Btw mr super genius, you used the wrong form of your in the third sentence of your rant.  Maybe your fourth study group should be grammar related  Edit: It must suck to know that many people on here dont like you and are only putting up with you.  And no the user you mentioned in your other rant is not one of them"
Chattanooga,3cghud,ItsBob_Loblaw,1 point,Wed Jul 8 03:42:37 2015 UTC,"You're being downvoted because in the dumbass southern accent with which all of these people speak, they really do honestly believe that ""bone' and ""bohn"" sound exactly the same."
Chattanooga,3cghud,sodamop,4,Wed Jul 8 15:15:07 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I kind of figured. It is funny though watching Southerners tell the Japanese how to speak Japanese."
Chattanooga,3cghud,TooSunny,-1,Wed Jul 8 17:12:51 2015 UTC,It's actually closer to Bohn than Bone.  Bohn Sa i
Chattanooga,3cghud,bruddahmacnut,9,Wed Jul 8 04:14:16 2015 UTC,"When we aren't using structured pronunciation across the board, all we are is a bunch of idiots sitting in front of a screen saying bonsai lol"
Chattanooga,3cghud,kthehun89,2,Wed Jul 8 04:16:13 2015 UTC,"""Bohn"" and ""bone"" would be identical in pronunciation? Both are close enough to correct. And I'm not sure why you tried to parse out the ""i"" from the ""sa"". It should be one syllable, exactly like the word ""sigh"" but maybe with just a slightly sharper clip to it. Semantics really, ""bone-sigh"" is most accessibly correct."
Chattanooga,3cghud,unscrambleme,3,Wed Jul 8 11:14:14 2015 UTC,That sounded accurate to me.  How do you say it if I may ask?
Chattanooga,3cghud,glableglabes,12,Tue Jul 7 22:30:45 2015 UTC,Boner-sized.
Chattanooga,3cghud,Username_Used,2,Tue Jul 7 23:44:44 2015 UTC,"Oh snap, looks like all 9 active /r/bonsai members have risen up against you. Best be careful - I'd hate to get on the bad side of a group of people with that much...patience."
Chattanooga,3cghud,hungryhungryME,2,Wed Jul 8 14:56:49 2015 UTC,"Japanese is one of the easiest languages in the world to pronounce. Everything is only pronounced one way. ""Bone-sigh"" is the correct way to say it. Just like how Toyota and Honda are mispronounced over here. Proper pronunciation are toe-yoe-tah, and hone-dah."
Chattanooga,3cghud,Robborboy,1 point,Wed Jul 8 00:53:56 2015 UTC,Pronounce Hyundai. I can guarantee you it doesn't rhyme with Sunday (no matter what their marketing crap says).
Chattanooga,3cghud,bruddahmacnut,2,Wed Jul 8 04:16:02 2015 UTC,"Given the word is from Korean, I am not sure how one would pronounce it. However if Korean were to follow the same romanization process as Japanese it would be pronounced hyoon-die."
Chattanooga,3cghud,Robborboy,1 point,Wed Jul 8 04:24:42 2015 UTC,"Right. The corporation itself purposefully mispronounced their name when introducing themselves to the US public, in the hopes to be better accepted.   Same thing with Toyota and Honda. Adapt for the market."
Chattanooga,3cghud,bruddahmacnut,-5,Wed Jul 8 04:33:42 2015 UTC,"Yes, it is simple to pronounce, which is why it's surprising three people have responded with this misinformation. Here are some examples of how native speakers pronounce it. No, it is not a hard ""bone sigh""."
Chattanooga,3cghud,TooSunny,2,Wed Jul 8 01:12:10 2015 UTC,"No offense, but did you listen to them? They literally say bone-sigh."
Chattanooga,3cghud,Robborboy,-2,Wed Jul 8 02:43:33 2015 UTC,"Yes...did you? Compare them to the video. Are you honestly saying they sound the same to you? For one, there's no pause in the middle of the word, and you don't stress the ""on"". It sounds like he's literally saying the two words ""bone"" and ""sigh"". There aren't syllables in Japanese the way there are in English."

Chattanooga,3chila,Deranged40,0,Wed Jul 8 15:26:00 2015 UTC,Goodwill is shit   I'm not really following you here.  Goodwill is shit because they axed an employee that was costing them money?
Chattanooga,3chila,kyfg,1 point,Thu Jul 9 00:14:54 2015 UTC,"He was helping people in need. Not costing goodwill money. Potential earnings, maybe. But they claim that giving a hand up, not a hand out is their motto. He didn't give anything away for free (what they paid for it). He gave discounts. They still made money if not as much as they could've. And instead of just firing him since they disagreed with his approach, they had him arrested for a felony charge for helping people in need. I doubt they would've backed out if huffpo didn't pick it up.  To quote the article's original opening line: ""No good deed goes unpunished""."
Chattanooga,3chila,Deranged40,1 point,Thu Jul 9 03:53:04 2015 UTC,"He gave discounts. They still made money if not as much as they could've.    As a non-profit charity they still have operational costs.  The article says he gave discounts up to 50% -- as an employee it is unlikely he would be accepting of Goodwill arbitrarily taking 25%-50% of his paycheck and giving it to people in need instead.  A payroll violation like that is a felony.  Charging him was a heavy-handed rush to judgment, but firing him was entirely appropriate.  However judging the entire organization on one corrected mistake is unfair.  If there was a pattern, that would be something to talk about."
Chattanooga,3chila,JimWilliams423,2,Thu Jul 9 12:03:27 2015 UTC,"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodwill_Industries#Criticism  I don't know anything about the Chattanooga Goodwills, but there's some info on why people don't care for the company, in general."
Chattanooga,3chila,n0ia,2,Thu Jul 9 14:29:00 2015 UTC,"Executive compensation   According to the article, fixed in 2005.   Wages for the disabled   That one seems like a legit complaint to me.  Based just on the article they are being duplicitous, trying to hide behind the law when nothing prevents them from doing better than the law themselves.  They need to own it and fix it.   Lobbying for regulation of donation boxes   I agree with Goodwill on that one.  Fake donation boxes for pseudo-charities has become a big problem, kind of like those phone scammers who solicit people pretending to be actual charities.  It takes advantage of people's trust, diverting resources away from actual charities and when the truth comes out it builds distrust causing people to be reluctant to donate at all."
Chattanooga,3chila,JimWilliams423,2,Thu Jul 9 14:51:51 2015 UTC,"Chattanooga actually just passed new legislation regarding donation box labeling requirements.  http://www.wrcbtv.com/story/29458049/new-legislation-implements-requirements-for-donation-bins   A new law is holding donation bin operators accountable. A little more than a year ago a local non-profit reached out to Channel-3 to warn the public about some unexplainable unmarked donation boxes popping up across the Tennessee valley. Now a new law implements labeling and placement requirements for the bins. The public can also help with accountability. People can now snap a photo of any donation bin in Tennessee, and post it to Twitter, Facebook or Instagram using the hashtag ""#bincheck"" as a way to report a bin in question to the division of charitable solicitations and gaming."
Chattanooga,3chila,n0ia,1 point,Thu Jul 9 15:02:45 2015 UTC,That's great.  Especially #bincheck.  It was the initial reporting last year that alerted me to the problem in the first place.
Chattanooga,3chila,JimWilliams423,0,Thu Jul 9 15:18:01 2015 UTC,"Sure, but the majority of my problem comes from how they handled this situation when they figured it out. They make up their prices on the spot anyway.  I'm sure the kid didn't cost them as much as they pay him in a year. We're talking about hundreds of dollars tops.   And they decided that they wanted to strip his right to vote and leave the country for this, rather than simply terminate his employment. They may have dropped charges, but they did have him arrested.  It's how they decided to handle quite a petty ""crime"" that I don't support in any way at all."
Chattanooga,3chila,Deranged40,-1,Thu Jul 9 13:54:22 2015 UTC,"Sure, but the majority of my problem comes from how they handled this situation when they figured it out.   You mean dropping the charges?  I'm just not seeing how your criticism is any more that zeroing in on a single incident.   Bad judgment by local management does not indict an organization.  Show me a repeated problem and I will be right there with you, until then I say you are the one being unreasonable."
Chattanooga,3chila,JimWilliams423,1 point,Thu Jul 9 14:36:55 2015 UTC,"No. When I say how they handled this situation when they figured it out., I definitely do not mean dropping the charges. That's how they reacted to the media picking up the story. I mean their immediate gut reaction to the situation before the media picked it up.  Before this had the potential to hurt their public image, they decided to have this kid arrested for a felony because he was helping someone.  It was their decisions that they made before dropping the charges to save some face that I don't like.   I won't forgive them, and I won't give them a dollar. Even if they dropped the charges. I'm pissed at and zeroing in on one instance. Doesn't take a repeat offender for me. We have plenty of thrift stores. I'm happy to donate to Bethel, and you don't have to agree with me."
Chattanooga,3chila,Deranged40,0,Thu Jul 9 14:38:50 2015 UTC,"I mean their immediate gut reaction to the situation before the media picked it up.   You mean the immediate gut reaction of a store manager?  Again not a systemic problem.  We are all human, we all make mistakes.  You are reading too much into the reporting.  According to the original report he was arrested on the 24th and charges were dropped on the 27th.  That is fast - it is very unlikely that upper management even knew about it.  Would it have been as fast without the media?  I dunno, but faulting the organization for over-ruling a local manager and fixing the problem in 3 days is unreasonable.  That is how it is supposed to work."
Chattanooga,3chila,JimWilliams423,0,Thu Jul 9 15:15:54 2015 UTC,"They then dropped the charges almost immediately. Any other company would have done the same thing. Employees can't just hand out discounts whenever they feel like it. I know the kid did it for the right reasons, but still."
Chattanooga,3chila,takabrash,2,Fri Jul 10 11:20:00 2015 UTC,"Read my other replies in here.   I don't care what they did in reaction to the media picking this up. I don't care how many (three) days it took to drop charges. They had him arrested for felony charges over, what, hundreds of dollars!? Termination seriously wasn't enough here? Remove the kid's right to vote or leave the country, that's the ticket.   This one incident is enough that I have not given a single dime or donation to the company since this story came out, and I am not willing to reconsider that.   You don't have to agree."
Chattanooga,3chila,Deranged40,0,Fri Jul 10 13:48:26 2015 UTC,"First of all, if it had been $100, it wouldn't be a felony. In the fourth sentence of the article you posted is tells the exact value of the discounts which was $2,728.88.  Secondly, every business, especially a large one, has to have policies in place for this kind of thing. They have to start at the top with pressing charges or employees will take advantage. Sad, but true. Eventually, the gears turn and a real human can evaluate the situation and find some leeway to drop the charges or not. In this case, they did. No harm no foul."

The bathroom is shared with two others. There is no dishwasher in the kitchen, and the house itself is in fair condition and in need of consistent, shared contributions to its cleanliness.

As a people we are fighting maintain the Heaven-ordained supremacy of the white man over the inferior or colored race; a white flag would thus be emblematical of our cause...... As a national emblem, it is significant of our higher cause, the cause of a superior race, and a higher civilization contending against ignorance, infidelity, and barbarism. Another merit in the new flag is, that it bears no resemblance to the now infamous banner of the Yankee vandals. - William T. Thompson, the motherfucker who designed the flag"

Chattanooga,3cfijn,asha1985,1 point,Tue Jul 7 16:40:39 2015 UTC,"Backyard breeders Backyard breeders are also motivated by profit. Ads from these unscrupulous breeders fill the classifieds. Backyard breeders may appear to be the nice neighbor next door-in fact, even seemingly good-intentioned breeders may treat their breeding pairs as family pets. However, continuously breeding animals for years to produce litters for a profit still jeopardizes the animals' welfare.  Some backyard breeders may only breed their family dog once in awhile, but they often are not knowledgeable on how to breed responsibly, such as screening for genetic defects. Responsible, proper breeding entails much more than simply putting two dogs together.  Taking homes away When puppy mills and backyard breeders flood the market with animals, they reduce homes available for animals from reputable establishments, shelters and rescue groups. Every year, more than 150,000 cats and dogs enter shelters in Washington State-6 to 8 million animals enter shelters nationwide. Sadly, only about 15 percent of people with pets in the U.S. adopted them from a shelter or rescue group, leaving so many deserving pets left behind. http://www.paws.org/get-involved/take-action/explore-the-issues/puppy-mills/"

I can get pretty fired up about this because I work in animal sheltering and realize that my views are a little more extreme than most folks because the whole reason for that kind of work stems from people's irresponsible pet decisions. I just try to encourage people to adopt or at least spay/neuter whenever this kind of thing pops up. Sorry if I came across as confrontational, that really wasn't the tone that I wanted to convey. I brought up the registration because it's the only low bar of regulation that is present in the dog trade industry. Folks who breed dogs just to make more dogs and make some money don't usually invest a lot in health & care of the puppies or their parents. People who sell those designer breed dogs usually only want to profit and the health of the litters and quality of life for the dogs that a bred can be pretty abysmal. Just my soapbox rant."

Chattanooga,3c0am7,khronostn,14,Fri Jul 3 16:33:22 2015 UTC,"Don't bother with cabs in Chattanooga. They're about evenly priced, Uber might be cheaper in some instances even. But Uber is on time, clean, reliable, the drivers are nice, etc.   I'll never use a cab again if I don't need to."
Chattanooga,3c0am7,vivanetx,8,Fri Jul 3 21:38:20 2015 UTC,"There is no comparison. The normal cabs here suck just as bad as everywhere else in the world*. Dirty, unprofessional, trying to scam you ""the credit card machine is broken"", late, ect. Just use uber and be done with it. Out of probably 50 rides with them one two or three weren't great. Of those three, only one was remotely unsafe, and that was brought about because I complimented the guys car and he wanted to show off.  *i've had one good can ride ever, and that was in Kyoto Japan"
Chattanooga,3c0am7,wehooper4,3,Fri Jul 3 19:14:39 2015 UTC,Uber is significantly better in my opinion. Our cabs are terrible and take forever to show up.
Chattanooga,3c0am7,doooom,0,Sat Jul 4 01:38:53 2015 UTC,"On the other hand, regular cabs don't try to constantly record everywhere you go 24hrs a day.  All that data Uber collects - even if it is just when and where you take an uber to - is ripe for hackers as well as subpoenas."
Chattanooga,3c0am7,JimWilliams423,3,Sat Jul 4 01:45:07 2015 UTC,"Fair enough. I always assume that my location's being tracked by various companies anyway, so it doesn't really shock or bother me. It would take a lot of drastic changes to the world we live in to free us of corporate and government spying, and I just don't see it happening."
Chattanooga,3c0am7,doooom,-1,Sat Jul 4 01:54:34 2015 UTC,"There are two problems with all the corporate stalking:  (1) For regular people the profile they build up on you is used to manipulate you into making poor economic choices - facebook alone is valued at $230 billion purely on their ability to manipulate people into spending money - no mere mortal can withstand that kind of investment in psychological warfare 100% of the time.  (2) For ""people of interest"" it becomes a tool of leverage - you might not be interesting today, but say you decide to run for political office.  You should expect that the incumbents (or the people with an interest in maintaining the status quo) will get your data and go over it looking for anything they can use against you.  The FBI did it to Martin Luther King Jr.  Even if you never become a person of interest yourself, do you want to live in a society where anyone challenging the status quo is squashed?"
Chattanooga,3c0am7,JimWilliams423,3,Sat Jul 4 03:44:01 2015 UTC,"no mere mortal can withstand that kind of investment in psychological warfare 100% of the time.   No one did even before the picked up all that data. Commercials and advertising were already good at what they do. Also to be fair ads aren't all bad. Without them youd never know about new products. Theres a difference between manipulating you to buy something and simply getting really good at showing you things they know you want.   Even if you never become a person of interest yourself, do you want to live in a society where anyone challenging the status quo is squashed?   Very reasonable but at the same time I dont think itll be as much of an issue as this describes. If it starts happening all the time then even the status quo can simply be challenged by someone pulling up their data. Itd be a level playing field still."
Chattanooga,3c0am7,iclimbnaked,0,Mon Jul 6 12:12:58 2015 UTC,"No one did even before the picked up all that data.   That's a false dichotomy.  Just as the internet made it 1000x easier to connect with people, Big Data makes it 1000x easier to manipulate people.  Think of it as the difference between showing you bikini girls hawking beer and showing you bikini girls that are exactly 'your type' - or deliberately seeking out people with a family history of alcoholism and giving them coupon codes for a ""first one's free"" bottle redeemable at the local liquor store.   Theres a difference between manipulating you to buy something and simply getting really good at showing you things they know you want.   The later is a pipe dream that they use to make it sound innocuous.  Just how good are the 'targeted ads' that you see?  That's right they suck - always showing you stuff that you've already bought.  It would require a full-blown artificial intelligence to figure out what you want because you are a full person.  However it doesn't take anywhere near as much effort to figure out how to nudge you, especially if the nudges need only be 10% effective -- a level which would still be considered a runaway success for any advertising campaign.   Itd be a level playing field still.   I'm sorry to be blunt, but that is ridiculously naive.  The people who challenge the status quo are the ones without power.  Power and the connections that come with it are what buys access to that kind of data.  The idea that just anyone could pull up your Uber travel history is a fantasy.  Their system has access controls nominally to keep the peons out - only the upper echelon has that kind of unrestricted access."
Chattanooga,3c0am7,JimWilliams423,2,Mon Jul 6 13:27:58 2015 UTC,"That's a false dichotomy. Just as the internet made it 1000x easier to connect with people, Big Data makes it 1000x easier to manipulate people.   Sure, I wasn't saying it didnt make it easier but advertising manipulation also isn't a sure thing. They arent making me buy anything, it isn't literally mind control. Maybe they make me want something I previously didnt sure, but its still on me for buying it. Im an adult. I haven't been so upset about anything ive bought so far. While sure maybe im just naturally less susceptible than most due to not buying much in general   Just how good are the 'targeted ads' that you see? That's right they suck    Not always, also I mean you do realize pushing things you might want is how the manipulation by most advertising companies works. Thats why big data is useful, they can push things you are more likely to buy because they know more about you. Sure maybe its something you wouldnt have bought had you just seen it on a shelf but its still something more targeted at you and your wants. I dont see nudging someone as all that different than simply matching me with something I want. They arent going to convince me to buy something Id never have had any interest in, our minds aren't that mold-able.  To your last point, while you have a point there will always be hackers that get that data out. There will always be employees that leak info. Rival political parties will constantly use it against eachother (as both are opposites but both in power) to the point where the general public will stop caring if x person went to a stripclub or something based off of their location data."
Chattanooga,3c0am7,iclimbnaked,0,Mon Jul 6 13:39:50 2015 UTC,"They arent going to convince me to buy something Id never have had any interest in, our minds aren't that mold-able.   However they are going to be able to put their stuff on your short list of choices - none of us have enough time to make a full comparison of all available options.  So despite inferior attributes they get themselves on the list and bump off possibly better choices - including the choice to simply spend your money on a completely different category of product.  Big Data makes all that much easier to do.   there will always be hackers that get that data out. There will always be employees that leak info.   Leaks -- especially targeted leaks for specific individuals -- are not anywhere near as reliable as being able to get it simply by asking.   to the point where the general public will stop caring if x person went to a stripclub or something    That's utopianism.  The idea that the public will ever 'get over' judging people against the moral standards of the day is just complete unrealistic.  Those moral standards exist to enforce conformity - we will always have versions of them, it is one of the tools humans use to maintain a society.  But people challenging the status quo already have to contend with the fact that challenging the status quo is itself non-conformist and unpopular with a significant part of the public.  The MLK case is a perfect example of that, conservatives hated the man.  It was only until he had been dead long enough to be mythologized into a watered down and ineffective pacifist that he attained universal popularity."
Chattanooga,3c0am7,JimWilliams423,2,Mon Jul 6 13:54:03 2015 UTC,However they are going to be able to put their stuff on your short list of choices   Sure but if their product is actually shit itll get knocked back off. Any meaningful purchase I make involves me doing a good bit of research. If its just for some soda or something then oh well I spent a dollar on a less good drink.  Theres no point in us arguing about all this. We just have different views. I dont see it as all doom and gloom. I know these negatives exist but I think the potential positives out weight the negatives. Your points are absolutely valid and are concerns I have its just This data has legitimate uses outside of potential selling off to advertisers/political people. Im all for these legitimate uses. Google gives me all kinds of useful info more quickly due to their data collection. Its worth it to me but this is a choice every individual should make and turn off their location services if they deem it not worth it.  Either way its unstoppable at this point.
Chattanooga,3c0am7,iclimbnaked,-2,Mon Jul 6 13:57:22 2015 UTC,"Any meaningful purchase I make involves me doing a good bit of research.   Good for you.  Like I said before, most of us don't have the time to dedicate to massive amounts of research for every product purchase we make.   Our free time is finite.  Or to be less snarky, I am pretty sure you vastly underestimate how much you operate on autopilot in your day to day choices because we all operate on autopilot.   Either way its unstoppable at this point.   Not in the least.  Advertising and Big Data snuck up on us and filled the niche that would have gone to things like micro-payments if they had been ready.  New technologies like bitcoin have the potential to reverse the trend such that the common internet funding model is no longer advertising.   Changes to the law that make companies responsible for the data they hold on their customers can change databases of customer profiles from profit centers to sources of liability.  The future is not predetermined."
Chattanooga,3c0am7,JimWilliams423,2,Mon Jul 6 14:10:11 2015 UTC,"Which google already does. If im letting google do it, I really dont care if Uber does.  Your concern is totally reasonable but people should be educated on whats being recorded. In my case, I really dont care."
Chattanooga,3c0am7,iclimbnaked,-2,Mon Jul 6 12:09:52 2015 UTC,"In my case, I really dont care.   Few regular people ever care until the consequences blindside them, and by then it is too late to undo it."
Chattanooga,3c0am7,JimWilliams423,2,Mon Jul 6 13:35:48 2015 UTC,"Sure again, im not saying people shouldn't be cautious about it. Im just saying I have thought about it and the potential consequences. I've decided I'm not worried.   You are right that it could bite me in the ass. I think there should be more clear cut rules about how this data can be used and more transparency about how its collected. The thing is all this data can be used for things that benefit the consumer. Ive decided I want those benefits. Anyone else out there whos informed can simply decide to turn off location services."
Chattanooga,3c0am7,iclimbnaked,-2,Mon Jul 6 13:44:32 2015 UTC,"Im just saying I have thought about it and the potential consequences.   Popularity of one service can crowd out the market for alternatives.  A privacy preserving service may simply not get enough traction to survive in the market so your choices affect other people's choices too.   Anyone else out there whos informed can simply decide to turn off location services.    (1) If you read the article, turning off location services isn't sufficient to stop the Uber app from tracking your movements and it certainly doesn't stop them from recording your Uber rides  (2) The goal of Big Data is collect it all - location tracking is just one small piece of the puzzle."
Chattanooga,3c0am7,JimWilliams423,3,Mon Jul 6 14:18:17 2015 UTC,"I've only used Uber about 5 times, but every time has been a good experience. If you are the talkative type, they will definitely talk with you.  If you prefer to be socially awkward and not say much like me, then they respect that. Much better experience than I've had with the local taxi services."

One thing I've never understood about Chattanooga taxis: why don't they stop for street hails? i.e. Why can't you just wave one down on the street corner--like in every other city I have lived in?  Someone once tried to tell me that it's illegal, but couldn't really give me a cogent explanation why."
Chattanooga,3c0am7,fnord_bronco,2,Sat Jul 4 02:17:00 2015 UTC,Safety. The boss doesn't know if there is a passenger. And profit. The boss doesn't know if there is an off the books passenger. Who what where type of thing. A couple of years ago a cab picked up a hail from a 15 year old kid.. Against policy. Kid blew the driver's brains out. No one knew the driver was 'missing' for hours until someone spotted the dead guy behind the wheel in their backyard.
Chattanooga,3c0am7,discofun,3,Sat Jul 4 05:22:33 2015 UTC,"I found the relevant ordinance (City code Sec 35 - 17 et seq).  From reading the applicable sections, it seems like there's more of a flimsy ""traffic congestion"" excuse.  It bans a host of activities that are commonplace (and often legal) elsewhere:    no cruising, especially near city bus stops no soliciting passengers on airport or bus station property. no street hails.   Taken altogether, it seems like these are in place to prevent competition.  The few taxi companies in the city are probably enjoying having a large marketshare and don't want to give anyone else a fair shot.  Remember a few months back when the taxi companies collectively shit themselves over Uber coming to town?  I just don't buy the safety angle.  Maybe it was the stated rationale when the rule was adopted but any cab driver is keenly aware of the risk that he might get his skull emptied."

Chattanooga,3bxslt,peptidemel,4,Fri Jul 3 03:20:37 2015 UTC,This reddit should go dark in solidarity.  The admins stopped listening to users long ago... why should the users listen to the admins?
Chattanooga,3bxslt,Chairman__Kaga,4,Fri Jul 3 02:41:06 2015 UTC,"This really started when they shut down fatpeoplehate and a couple of others.  The amount of content has gone way down since then.

Chattanooga,3bxslt,BuckRowdy,3,Fri Jul 3 04:36:26 2015 UTC,"I think this really started when Reddit was bought out and appointed Ellen Pao.

We may be too big to lose practically everything like Dig did, but Reddit is definitely not happy about the direction it's been going.

Chattanooga,3bxslt,caseytuggle,2,Fri Jul 3 14:22:09 2015 UTC,"I registered my first voat account last night.  Speaking of ""Nature abhors a vacuum"", this may be an opportunity for a Chattanooga based developer to start a Reddit knock-off/Reddit killer. The platform is open source, the bandwidth is here, some servers and a time investment should be all that's needed (I don't mean to trivialize the amount of effort required...the payoff could be huge though)."
Chattanooga,3bxslt,chredit,2,Fri Jul 3 15:14:09 2015 UTC,We need something better than yet-another centrally-hosted discussion forum like digg/reddit/voat and every other system out there.  We need something that is P2P and distributed across the computers of all the users - a sort of usenet/bittorrent combo.  Chatt would be a good place to deploy it in since we have so much bi-directional bandwidth thanks to EPB -- it would make phone-based clients running on wifi very-doable.
Chattanooga,3bxslt,JimWilliams423,1 point,Fri Jul 3 15:16:00 2015 UTC,"It's good in theory, but I can't help but wonder what kind of legal ramifications there would be for when someone inevitably posts illegal content."

Chattanooga,3bxslt,craigge,1 point,Sat Jul 4 03:38:12 2015 UTC,"Wouldn't prevent users from shutting down their servers that help distribute the content if they go on ""strike"".  Or an individual from building a distribution farm and controlling a large percent of the network.  Shut that down and then could potentially lose content and at the least slow down the network.   Don't know of any real world implementation though.  Just seems like youd run into similar but different limitations if those who control the content and bandwidth get pissed or want to be jerks."
Chattanooga,3bxslt,MrNagant,1 point,Sun Jul 5 18:51:17 2015 UTC,"Here's a first pass: Aether  From the FAQ:   Aether is an app you install to your computer to connect to Aether network. This network is made of different boards (forums) where people post and discuss things. On the surface, it's fairly similar to Slashdot, Metafilter, Reddit, or any other community site on the Internet.  The different thing about Aether is that it doesn't have a server somewhere. The only thing the app does is that it finds and connects to other people using Aether. In other words, it's a distributed, peer-to-peer network.  This makes it impossible to censor, and renders its users anonymous. It's useful for people concerned about privacy, or pretty much anyone who doesn't want to be watched and catalogued for every word they write on the Internet (so, pretty much everybody).  It's also temporary. Whatever you post disappears after six months. It's designed to be an ephemeral space, and it's focused on now, rather than the past. Other people can still keep copies of what you wrote, but it won't last forever in the network itself. They also won't know who you are."

So what?  Is that something you can arrest someone for?  Surely not; just don't fill the damn prescription.    Anywho, I did find this information on Gabapentin, the pain/seizure relief medicine he seems to take or abuse:     This medication may cause blurred vision or impair your thinking or reactions. Be careful if you drive or do anything that requires you to be alert and able to see clearly.   If he did have that drug in his system at the time of the crash, it very well could have been a primary cause of the wreck.  Sources say that he had received a ticket the day before this wreck for causing a different wreck as well.

It's associated with the Civil War, sure, but slavery wasn't even a pressing issue regarding the war; it was merely a by-product or side issue.  Hell, the flag that we know today wasn't even the official Confederate flag during the war.  It was just a battle flag used by the army of Northern Virginia."
Chattanooga,3bj93e,GooglesYourShit,4,Tue Jun 30 16:37:00 2015 UTC,"Actually, there are more recent uses of the flag that have considered it racist.

It's associated with the Civil War, sure, but slavery wasn't even a pressing issue regarding the war; it was merely a by-product or side issue.   Oh gee for example, let's look at the South Carolina declaration of succession that states they are leaving the union BECAUSE OF SLAVERY. South Carolina was the first state to leave the union, in case you didn't know. See any mention of any other reason they wanted to cut ties? States' rights? Taxes? No? Yep, just good ole' ""blacks are our property and no one's taking our property away from us."" And of course another user has posted multiple examples furthering my point. Slavery was obviously a major issue, and anyone who's passed anything higher than 8th grade History should know that.

They are capped due to insurance on how many members they can have.  About $250 for the first year...$125 thereafter.  The best place to shoot in a 50 mile circle of here.

It is cold, very cold.  Hiwassee is great, but water is kinda cold.  If you want to float, dig in your cooler, and not worry about rapids or cold, then try the Lower Ocoee.  Dumpy's bar now has a sign advertising tube rentals.  I don't know how to get in contact, but the people at Cherokee Rafting can help.  O.A.R. rents tubes and provides shuttle.  They will probably check your cooler since they will be responsible for you. Put in at the Ocoee Dam #1 and float to Nancy Ward take out.  Watch out for sticks on the banks in places where the current is swift.  Otherwise a lazy float.  Google ""Ocoee 1 TVA schedule"" and you will find out when it runs.  It is dam released, so it has consistent water levels."

Its a gentle float that ends with a bang. 3 fun rapids, one of which is a 10' slide into a pool.   Hiawassee is a great option! beware, its cold water. Id wear some long sleeve (winter underamour or neoprem) for ideal comfort. Worst case you take it off and tie it to the tube. or jump in...   For non whitewater check out lower occoe as suggested below. I'm sure there are more."

It's actually exactly where I'd say the border is between very bad and only kind of bad, but I definitely wouldn't move there.   There's a couple homes for sale in my neighborhood. Look up Byrd Ave. in the Cherokee Woods neighborhood (right off Lightfoot Mill Rd.). They've both been for sale for awhile and both could be talked down. I'd guess they're in the $50-80K range. It's a very low/non-crime neighborhood. That side of it is mixed in terms of who your neighbors will be, but there's no gangs or violent crimes. They're definitely good potential. I'm right up the street on Peach if you want more lowdown on the neighborhood.  PM me any time if you have more questions."

Red Bank, Mountain Creek Rd, Ashland Terrace, and about a mile or two down Dayton Blvd past Morrison Springs Rd is your best bet. The houses on the road connecting to Hardee's are pretty nice as well but not sure how many people are selling in that area (best friend lives there).    Dods Avenue as we call it...

Chattanooga,3b8xe3,autowikibot,1 point,Sat Jun 27 19:03:21 2015 UTC,"State fair:       A state fair is an annual competitive and recreational gathering of a U.S. state's population, usually held in late summer or early fall. It is a larger version of a county fair, often including only exhibits or competitors that have won in their categories at the more-local county fairs.  State fairs began in the nineteenth century for the purpose of promoting state agriculture, through competitive exhibitions of livestock and display of farm products. As the U.S. evolved from a predominantly agrarian to an industrial society in the twentieth century, modern state fairs have expanded to include carnival amusement rides and games, display of industrial products, automobile racing, and entertainment such as musical concerts. Large fairs can admit more than a million visitors over the course of a week or two. The first U.S. state fair was that of New York, held in 1841 in Syracuse, and has been held annually to the present year.  The second state fair was in Detroit, Michigan, which ran from 1849  to 2009.    Events similar to state fairs are also held annually in each state capital in Australia, known as Royal Shows. Australian Royal shows are organized by state agricultural and horticultural societies, and are described further in the agricultural show article.

Chattanooga,3b4unw,zartonis,1 point,Fri Jun 26 17:19:03 2015 UTC,"I just moved here yesterday, right off exit 11. This is crazy. Hopefully this isn't a normal thing..?  My condolences to all the victims."
Chattanooga,3b4unw,aspirations27,4,Fri Jun 26 05:42:59 2015 UTC,"Normal thing? Yes. Yes it is. Carnage to this extent? Not so much. Unfortunately rush hour in this town gets more dangerous every day. Inattentive drivers, road rage, and speed demon truckers all make up the majority of people driving at 6-9 am and 3-6 pm. Add some rain to the mix, or put it all together on a Friday, and the result is the same  type of traffic caused by this accident except with no such accident. The interstates here are often parking lots for no reason. But this. This shouldn't have happened."
Chattanooga,3b4unw,ubadeansqueebitch,7,Fri Jun 26 10:52:23 2015 UTC,"I just moved here from Chicago. The way some people drive down here (especially trucks, especially on I-75) is really aggressive.   I love this city otherwise haha."
Chattanooga,3b4unw,firahs,5,Fri Jun 26 12:27:09 2015 UTC,"Agree. The trucks. In the stretch of roads south and east of town until just past this exit, the trucks are very aggressive."
Chattanooga,3b4unw,heyyouholdmahbeer,2,Fri Jun 26 13:41:17 2015 UTC,"glad to hear someone mention this.  I went to school in Chicago, and I grew baffled as to why we down here think big city drivers are terrifying.  semi trucks are the worst."
Chattanooga,3b4unw,8bitOrchid,2,Fri Jun 26 15:51:28 2015 UTC,"My first time driving down here for a job interview was terrifying. I was coming in on 24 Eastbound.  I wasn't used to driving on curvy mountain interstates. I was still maintaining the speed limit or slightly above, but I distinctly remember semis just blazing past me doing 75+ mph. Those things are fucking terrifying."
Chattanooga,3b4unw,HotChicken69,3,Fri Jun 26 18:34:48 2015 UTC,I think we made the same trip. 6% grade downhill with emergency escape ramps on the side? Trucks just flyyyyyying down and tailgating you.    I did the trip with most of my possessions packed in my car. Clenched Midwest butt cheeks all the way down. Terrible. Haha.   I think the area was monteagle
Chattanooga,3b4unw,firahs,1 point,Fri Jun 26 18:40:35 2015 UTC,"Yup. I was coming from Indiana. Lately, when I go back home I try to go up 27 to 111 and several other highways. Eventually, I end up getting on I-65 a little north of Bowling Green, KY. Not sure if you make the trip very often, but the highways are really nice and mostly vacant. Now, I don't hate that trip as much anymore."
Chattanooga,3b4unw,HotChicken69,1 point,Fri Jun 26 18:51:03 2015 UTC,I think people don't realize how busy of a trucking corridor that both I-75 and I-24 are here.  I still prefer either to the Dan Ryan though...
Chattanooga,3b4unw,foxhunter,1 point,Fri Jun 26 15:51:38 2015 UTC,Oh yeah. I think the traffic on the Dan Ryan is worse for sure.   I'm just not used to getting passed by speeding 18 wheelers :)
Chattanooga,3b4unw,firahs,2,Fri Jun 26 16:29:50 2015 UTC,That's because Chicago has the 294 bypass that lets most interstate truckers bypass the city.  Chatt has no bypasses and probably won't get one any time soon because money.
Chattanooga,3b4unw,JimWilliams423,2,Fri Jun 26 16:38:38 2015 UTC,"I politely turned down a job in Collegedale to avoid commuting on that stretch of road. The pay was not worth the stress of going through that twice a day.   Are the accidents that bad? No, this is an extreme. Are there accidents along this stretch of 75 every day? Yes."
Chattanooga,3b4unw,tatostix,-14,Fri Jun 26 15:16:45 2015 UTC,"That is the price of the war on terror.  The 100s of billions we spend every year on things the NSA, and foreign wars is money we don't spend on things like transportation infrastructure and road safety.  Is it worth it?"
Chattanooga,3b4unw,JimWilliams423,6,Fri Jun 26 12:25:36 2015 UTC,"The fuck are you blabbering about. They are literally doing construction work to repave the interstate directly north of the crash site, and exit 11 is brand new having only been completely redone and expanded within the last couple of years."
Chattanooga,3b4unw,RyanBDawg,-8,Fri Jun 26 14:00:15 2015 UTC,"All that and yet congestion and safety is still terrible all around chattanooga.  The city is the 7th most dangerous to drive in.  The ridge cut is one of the most dangerous stretches of highway in the state.The country wastes over $100 billion/year in time and fuel alone due to the poor state of transportation infrastructure.  35,000 people are killed in traffic accidents every year, that's 100 per day compared to barely 100 people killed by terrorists over nearly a decade and a half.  Just because a tiny portion of the problem is being addressed doesn't mean the  problem is even close to being solved.  We have finite resources to spend - it is time we start spending it more intelligently."
Chattanooga,3b4unw,JimWilliams423,2,Fri Jun 26 14:12:15 2015 UTC,"Then I guess people should get off their phones and put down the big gulps and focus on driving.  If I made the rules I would institute corporal punishment for stupidity.  Oh you were texting and driving, guess who gets to get their ass totally kicked today."
Chattanooga,3b4unw,RyanBDawg,-5,Fri Jun 26 14:22:54 2015 UTC,"Yes, That will fix everything!  The problem isn't poor governing by the people whose responsibility it is to govern.   Forget engineering and science, the real problem is the poor character of drivers.   If I made the rules I would institute corporal punishment for stupidity.   Such irony."
Chattanooga,3b4unw,JimWilliams423,3,Fri Jun 26 14:29:01 2015 UTC,I'm pretty sure the main problem in Chattanooga stems from piss poor drivers.
Chattanooga,3b4unw,RyanBDawg,6,Fri Jun 26 14:31:49 2015 UTC,"Actually, the interstates though the city are extremely poorly planned.  This far north it wasn't really an issue, but from Moccasin Bend to the 75/127 split are very poorly designed for interstate speeds.  The curves are much too small around the river and at 27/24, the elevation climb combined with curvature is poor up the ridge, and there aren't nearly enough merging lanes for the 75 connection."
Chattanooga,3b4unw,asha1985,1 point,Fri Jun 26 15:35:14 2015 UTC,"That's why the speed limit is 55 through there. I was driving 60 in the right lane coming down the ridge a few days ago. This guy drove right up on my ass. I saw him flipping me off and yelling a string of what I assumed be obscenities at me.  I politely waved back and slowed down to 55.    If you're in the left lane going less than 70 during morning rush hour, people get pissed."
Chattanooga,3b7527,MusikLehrer,9,Fri Jun 26 14:45:44 2015 UTC,I got ordained by the Universal Life Church this year to marry two of my friends.  I live in Cleveland and would be happy to marry couples for no cost once the state allows same sex marriage.

Chattanooga,3b7527,8bitOrchid,1 point,Fri Jun 26 15:32:25 2015 UTC,"I would check with the local clerks office before trying to officiate.  From the ULC website...   We've recently become aware of an attorney general's opinion that calls into question the validity of Universal Life Church ordinations. Ordained ministers of the Universal Life Church have successfully performed thousands of weddings in this state before the opinion was released. Again, this opinion was published at the request of Republican State Senator Todd Gardenhire, and beginning summer 2015 our ministers began to report that their ordinations were being actively rejected by Tennessee County Clerks. We are keeping eyes on the situation and investigating all of our options. We would appreciate you letting us know if you personally encounter any problems with a government official in your area.   I got ordained as well and reading that pissed me off."
Chattanooga,3b7527,StrangerMind,1 point,Fri Jun 26 21:54:07 2015 UTC,Well that's not cool.  I'll have to call the county clerk Monday and check.
Chattanooga,3b7527,gregorykicks,4,Fri Jun 26 22:09:26 2015 UTC,They technically have 25 days to get everything in order. Hopefully they will get everything done quicker than that.
Chattanooga,3b7527,tatostix,1 point,Fri Jun 26 15:03:45 2015 UTC,Well they are well within their rights since they have 25 days to get shit in order. I wouldn't expect anyone to do it within a few hours of the ruling though.
Chattanooga,3b7527,Royal_Robin,3,Fri Jun 26 15:19:26 2015 UTC,It would have been nice if they'd had a plan in place though. It's not like this ruling came out of nowhere.

Chattanooga,3b7527,Royal_Robin,1 point,Fri Jun 26 15:34:50 2015 UTC,"Things like the internet and ideologically aligned news channels have made it much easier for different segments of the population to become inward looking and block out any news that contradicts their world-views.  It doesn't help that google and facebook profile people and give them personalized results which are basically ""more of the same.""  But sooner or later reality intrudes."
Chattanooga,3b7527,JimWilliams423,0,Fri Jun 26 16:17:16 2015 UTC,I wouldn't expect anyone to do it within a few hours of the ruling though.    Really?  Even other hardcore anti-gay red states like Alabama was marrying gay people before noon today.

Chattanooga,3b4yt3,Adam_HK,3,Fri Jun 26 00:54:11 2015 UTC,I went last Friday and tried out the flight. Pretty good! It was very crowded though. I'm wondering if they're planning to be more of a tap room like the old Chatt Brew on Frazier.
Chattanooga,3b4yt3,suddenlyissoon,5,Fri Jun 26 01:01:00 2015 UTC,Yes. They do not plan for food at all.

Chattanooga,3ayn8b,suddenlyissoon,5,Wed Jun 24 15:56:18 2015 UTC,"Very cool. My only question is: Why Chattanooga? I mean the city is great and all, but I didn't think we would stand out as a prime place to hold an international sports game."
Chattanooga,3ayn8b,Overclicked,6,Wed Jun 24 16:29:21 2015 UTC,"Its a friendly, so not as big a deal as a match that matters.  The womens team doesnt get much love even in big cities. Ive been to a match in Atlanta and nearly no one was there. Chattanooga will easily pass the attendance that was there given the fact we sometimes have 10k people at our local teams matches.  Basically Chattanooga loves soccer and they think they can sell out Finley for it. Also Theyve played at Finley before back in the 90s. Weve turned heads in the league our Soccer team is in. The average league attendance is something like 500 but meanwhile we average thousands of people."

The cop was really nice and basically told me that if I went to court, they'd dismiss it and it wouldn't go on my record. I did what he said and it worked. At the court date, literally everybody who had a speeding ticket (a couple for 20 over like yours) got their tickets bumped down to just $50 + court costs (comes out to around $100 or so) and no points on their record. The traffic court judge is really lenient and forgiving. Save yourself some money (and the points on your record), go in and get it reduced.   Edit: Also, I doubt the judge would order defensive driving school in your case. When I went, he only did that for violators who had been in an accident or had an excessive violation."

All joking aside, this was shortly after Parkway became the Pint, and we were all still lamenting the loss of our beautiful  hellhole (sopping our tears with duckfat tots and reflecting over the fact that nobody had ever realized Parkway's bar was actually shiny foil underneath.)  I'd just spent the weekend drunk and oblivious at Chattacon. I was midway through my twenties, single, a virgin, total geek, and trying to be a man. I'm actually a woman, turns out (problems? Yes? No? Good, moving on...), but at the time I was trying the whole Mulan 'be a man' thing.  Thus, I'd started con with one goal; sex. Considering that con always devolves into drunken debauchery and shenanigans after dark, the chances of me scoring with some otaku cosplay cutie who was probably less drunk than me was actually pretty good. And I got some good fun; handfuls of breast and a full-frontal-flash.  Alas, my follow through was lacking, and after two nights of avoiding sobriety and decency, I was still a virgin, and now much poorer and hungover.  So what does one do on Sunday, when you wake up probably still drunk, a failure, dejected, and trying to salvage your weekend? You're thinking a little hair of the dog, right?  No, silly, this is about the Pint.   Sunday evening I find myself at the pint with my friends, chief amongst them Shifty. Now, some of you may actually have met Shifty. I'm certain you've at least passed him if you've ever been to the Pint. If so, you'll understand what happens next. If not, know that Shifty is NEVER TO BE TRUSTED (I love you man!).  Shifty calls up a friend, who is a girl, to hang with us. She agrees, but for some reason we end up taking a side trip with her to Shifty's place in a cab. On the way back to the pint, Shifty let's slip my plan for the weekend and how it had failed. The girl is DELIGHTED by this idea, and becomes bound and determined to have my V-Card destroyed by Monday.  Ostensibly, the original plan was for her to help me pick up a girl, but late evening on Sunday at the Pint, prospects were scarce. In the end, she took me into the women's bathroom and... that was that.  No, no details. I was a gentleman then and I'm a lady now, and I shan't discuss the specifics. Suffice to say, I'm no longer a virgin.   After that, it was a wild ride, which is a story in itself which we should save for another time. But, I want to add that, this was still when the waters were a little untested with the Pint. We knew it was a cleaner, safer, tastier followup to Parkway, but we had no idea if ALL of the charm was lost. We thought we'd had our bar replaced by a glorified restaurant in which everything that happened was hipster cool and totally expected. There was a fear that the Pint was too TAME!  And then i lost my virginity on the women's bathroom after Chattacon, and we knew, deep down, a part of Parkway lived on."

Chattanooga,3b08c8,AvalanchedPeach,8,Thu Jun 25 13:51:31 2015 UTC,I was excited until I read that he wants to make it a family pub. I'd love some clear air but I don't need a side of children to go with it.
Chattanooga,3b08c8,doooom,2,Thu Jun 25 03:32:17 2015 UTC,Oh thank goodness.  That is what keeps me from going there.  I would rather smell dog poop than smoke on my clothes
Chattanooga,3b08c8,craigge,2,Thu Jun 25 15:58:33 2015 UTC,I won't be going back. There isn't anything special about the place that would attract me now.
Chattanooga,3b08c8,clip68,2,Thu Jun 25 11:53:01 2015 UTC,"You don't enjoy the food?  I love the food and that's what I normally go for.  Now that we have a little one, I can't go there as often as I would like.  I don't think them taking away smoking is going to mean they are going to start having Easter Egg hunts on the premises."
Chattanooga,3b08c8,AvalanchedPeach,1 point,Thu Jun 25 13:51:05 2015 UTC,"And the quality of the food will actually make this a really good decision for them.  I know a lot of people here hate the idea of a family pub, but not allowing families into a business really cuts out a ton of potential customers.  Especially when you're trying to be more than just a dive bar."
Chattanooga,3b08c8,asha1985,0,Thu Jun 25 17:26:55 2015 UTC,The food is tasty but a little heavy for me. I know they are sticking to a theme but most if the time I can't eat it all and I suffer for hours after. I went to enjoy a few drinks with the wife during brunch hours. I know I am not exactly their ideal customer.
Chattanooga,3b08c8,clip68,2,Fri Jun 26 11:41:12 2015 UTC,It means I can actually go in there now without having my throat close up.

Not sure how best to get in touch with you, but I would be willing to take them off your hands if you need to get rid of them.  $20 for that much cool material is a bargain."

Edit: if it's hissing, obviously not too friendly. However, I CAN conclusively say it used to be someone's pet. Ferrets are almost exclusively bred by Marshalls, and are fixed. Not sure what happened to that little one, but it doesn't look too healthy and has likely been abused."

I'm also excited about seeing Unknown Hinson again. I saw him the last time he was at Rhythm & Brews and he put on an amazing show. He's easily one of the best guitarists I've ever seen/heard.

Seems like now - Portland is a Nashville suburb.  Used to live on Rt.1 in the row of houses right in between the Junior and High school.  Totally different world there now.
