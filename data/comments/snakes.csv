snakes,3e3vv9,snakebuddies,2,Tue Jul 21 19:28:06 2015 UTC,"Ground snakes are small fossorial snakes, that are quite communal. It is not uncommon to find five or even a dozen of them under one rock or board. These eight Variable Ground snakes (Sonora semiannulata) were all found under such a board. We gathered them up, and put them in a bag, so that we could move them to a shaded area for some quick photos. When we opened up the bag a few minutes later, they were nicely huddled in this little ball.  Like other small, underground-dwelling snakes, this is their attempt to ""dig"" and hide from a potential threat. We gently separated them, snapped a few photos, and released them all back under the board where they were found."

Check out the munson feeding plan, it will give you a good idea on how much and how ofter you should feed him. Its hard for me to tell how much without seeing how big he is. Have you weighed him?  You need a thermostat for the heatmat, if they are not regulated they get very hot, and can cause burns.  Edit: Regarding the hides, a snake needs a really snug hide with only one opening to feel safe and comfortable, so if your hides are too big, then stuffing them with something is a good idea."

snakes,3e0ll9,PheonixStarLight,3,Tue Jul 21 01:23:17 2015 UTC,"the primary reason for ball pythons to not eat for months at a time is winter. shorter days can trigger an instinctual ""hibernation"" where they lose interest in eating because there would be less prey available in the wild during the winter months. my older BP falls in this category. when he rejects three meals in a row in december/november, i know it's time to stop trying. the next time i offer him a rat is mid-april. if he refuses it, i try again in mid-may, at which point he's definitely ready to eat again.  the second reason for refusals to eat is general fussiness. my other BP falls into this category. i've been doing the switching-from-mice-to-rats dance with her for the entire year i've had her. some weeks she'll take a rat without hesitation, other weeks she refuses the rat not matter what i do, and other weeks i can't even get her to eat a mouse. her refusals to eat are totally unpredictable. i never know how many rats will end up in the trash before she decides to eat again."
snakes,3e0ll9,_ataraxia,2,Tue Jul 21 03:57:17 2015 UTC,"Well I can never predict when my bp will eat. He seems to like to skip meals, rather than go on full hunger strikes.  I hate wasting rats. I know it should be okay to refreeze a thawed item but I'm just not comfortable with that from a hygienic point of view. So I got a second bp and hopefully they won't go on hunger strikes at the same time and I can recycle an uneaten rat x) Right now she's still too small to eat the medium rats I feed to my first bp. We'll see if I was right! (I didn't really get a second snake just for that! It was more like a potentiel added bonus!)"
snakes,3e0j12,Snake_Looked_weird,4,Tue Jul 21 00:47:59 2015 UTC,That's just his muscles working to get the mouse down. Basically he's bracing himself against the ground to help push it towards his stomach. At least that's what I see when I look at it.  I personally don't think it's anything to worry about.
snakes,3e0j12,ValentineBlacker,2,Tue Jul 21 00:56:19 2015 UTC,Well that makes sense i guess i get worried at the little things with this guy! Thank you for calming me
snakes,3e0j12,Tigger_tigrou,2,Tue Jul 21 01:04:35 2015 UTC,I think I remember my bp doing that when he was younger and much smaller. It's hard to tell whether he still does it because he hardly leaves his hide when he eats anymore.  They do that when they overexert their bodies (please someone correct if I'm wrong - I'm not claiming to be a specialist!)

snakes,3dz6qd,heezyboy13,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:47:16 2015 UTC,I would not be keeping that snake on sand. He's soaking because the sand is likely too drying for him - gophers don't usually soak.
snakes,3dz6qd,merlyn923,0,Mon Jul 20 23:01:31 2015 UTC,what do you recommend. she's been fine with it for the last year. she burrows around but I'm definatly open for suggestions!
snakes,3dz6qd,merlyn923,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:06:33 2015 UTC,Aspen is probably the perennial favorite.
snakes,3dzkzo,TheViolentDwarf,5,Mon Jul 20 20:29:19 2015 UTC,"The rule of thumb is that the length + width of a cage should be at least as long as the snake. Boas - being more active than other snakes like ball pythons - do benefit from have more room, however. I'd say right now is the time to start planning his next cage. He's not likely super-cramped yet, so if you need another month or two to gather materials/money, you aren't in dire straights or anything.  A full-grown Colombian male won't likely exceed 7 feet long (though it can definitely happen!), and would need a cage that's at least 6' x 2' to be comfortable (height isn't as important for adults, but I'd go at least 1' to make handling/cleaning easier). I would personally go straight to the fully adult-sized cage if you can - you'll save more money in the long run. Boas, especially young boas, will use all of the room you offer them and I've found they really enjoy exploring. If you choose to go this route, be sure to give your buddy several extra hides and some climbing branches and fake plants to help him feel more secure as he adjusts to the larger place.   Are you building your own custom cage, or would you rather buy a quality ready-made cage? I can give you some recommendations if it's the latter."
snakes,3dzkzo,almightyshadowchan,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:59:55 2015 UTC,"height isn't as important for adults, but I'd go at least 1' to make handling/cleaning easier   At the very least ... no less. 1 foot is too low for an adult IMO. My RTB loves to climb and explore vertically. I built a 2-story cage with each story 16"" high, and he's constantly booping at the ceiling. His next cage will have at least 2.5 feet vertical space."
snakes,3dzkzo,novel_yet_trivial,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:21:46 2015 UTC,"More is certainly always better! I've heard that as they reach their maximum size (5+ years), they become less and less apt to climb because of their relatively heavy bodies, but my own boas aren't old/big enough for me to have personal experience there."
snakes,3dzkzo,almightyshadowchan,3,Tue Jul 21 03:54:48 2015 UTC,"as they reach their maximum size (5+ years), they become less and less apt to climb because of their relatively heavy bodies   Mine is 20 years old and just shy of 7 feet (male), and loves to climb. He usually does not go for extreme height, I think he's just looking new places to explore. He does spend most of his time in the upper level of his cage.   Many people don't believe it, but snakes have personalities. Maybe I just got the weird one. I've only ever had one."
snakes,3dzkzo,novel_yet_trivial,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:03:01 2015 UTC,"I'm on my second. The first wouldn't get off the floor / out of her hides unless it was dinnertime (or an escape attempt) at any age. This new youngster outright refuses every hidey-hole, nook & cranny & sits at the tallest part of the viv nomatter what, despite being in plain-open view.  They certainly do have their differences! (the second isn't even head-shy, like at all...)"
snakes,3dza3m,joeydee93,3,Mon Jul 20 19:11:01 2015 UTC,"I would not say that rainbow boas make a good first snake. That doesn't mean you shouldn't get one. All it means is they are more difficult to keep than the more commonly kept species like ball pythons and corn snakes.  Two main things make CRBs more intermediate, than ""beginner"" snakes. One, they're nippy babies. A bitey snake that doesn't want to be held is very off putting to most people. Babies typically calm down with age and regular handling, but some remain grumpy as adults. Make sure you're okay with that being a potential reality for you. These snakes have very high humidity requirements. It's pretty difficult to maintain 80% to 90% humidity. It can require a lot of trial and error, and if you don't iron that out before you get the animal it's health could seriously suffer for it. Not only is humidity tricky to keep up, but high humidity is also conducive to molding, so you need to be vigilant about that too. Mold could also make the snake very sick.   If you want get this species in particular, you can make up for your lack of first-hand experience with research. Lots, and lots, and lots of research. Know your temps, humidity, everything, off the top of your head. Know the common problems with keeping the species, and know how to solve them. Have an exotic vet lined up. Buy from an experience breeder that can help answer your questions, not just the cheapest animal you can find.  If you're passionate and serious about this, you can totally do it. Just know 100% what you're getting into and be prepared for any potential issues."
snakes,3dza3m,skullbird,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:34:17 2015 UTC,"Came here to say essentially the same thing - I personally would not recommend a CRB, or any rainbow boa, as a first snake."
snakes,3dza3m,EccentricEpicrates,3,Tue Jul 21 00:27:44 2015 UTC,"A snake is a long-term commitment so you better get one that you love rather than the ""easiest"" one, for sure ;) As long as you do your research, you'll be fine! Post pictures once you have the snake, if you have time :)"
snakes,3dza3m,Tigger_tigrou,3,Tue Jul 21 00:01:35 2015 UTC,"Not everyone will agree, but if you want a CRB, do your research and go for it.  There's nothing worse than someone who wants something exotic, gets told, ""Get a ball python/corn snake/insert starter snake species here,"", takes the advice and gets one, then is stuck with a species that doesn't actually interest them.  It's not fair to either the owner or the 'easy' snake they picked.  Do all your research.  Know that snake's habitat needs until you can recite them in your sleep.  Make a proper setup, make sure your temps and humidity are good - more than 'just mist a few times a day'.  Then go for it."

snakes,3dza3m,squishybloo,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:01:18 2015 UTC,So what is the best source on snake info? Wiki says CRB average 3-5 feet but I have seen other place say as much as 6 or 7 feet. Also I was going to have the enclosure set up before I get a snake and have a test run how long should I test it to make sure the temp and humity is stable and right? I was thinking a week or 2?
snakes,3dza3m,snakejudy,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:17:34 2015 UTC,"I have approximate knowledge of many things!  To be honest?  I Google.  A lot.  Even then, you can't guarantee 100% accuracy of course - what I tend to do is read contributions here (of course!) every day, and also try to cross-reference multiple other online resources to see what everyone agrees with, combine with some common sense (no sand for beardies, etc), and go from there. The actual snake sites with care guides that I'm seeing say 4-5 feet is the average, with females getting bigger than males.  I'd say a test run of 1-2 weeks would be a bit much; you should be okay with just a day or two.  :)  If electronics go bad, they tend to either be bad right away, or take months/years - so you shouldn't need too much lead time.  Keep in mind that you should try to avoid putting a baby snake into an adult enclosure, as well - lots of space can and will intimidate them!  I'd either start with a small one and graduate them up as they grow, or set up a partition that you can move out and finally remove when they're big enough."
snakes,3dza3m,blm94,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:37:27 2015 UTC,"Ya that is what I have been doing, just did not know if there was a nearly perfect source on theses things. I want to do everything I can to have a happy snake.   So I was not planning on putting a baby snake in an adult enclosure. But doing a DYI one out of a plastic box for the first couple of years. Then when the snake is nearly fully grown and I have saved enough money buy a really nice glass home for it. Should I get a new enclosure more often? I was going to use 1sq foot of space for 1 foot of snake. So a baby is 18"" to 2 feet and would probably upgrade when the snake is about 3 feet. So I was think of getting a box 3 foot sq so something like this http://www.amazon.com/Sterilite-16598008-Quart-Clear-Storage/dp/B00C9MR9YM/ref=pd_sim_201_8?ie=UTF8&refRID=0CNWJTQ363HFS6824EZW   I have read that these would work well or this too big?"
snakes,3dza3m,merlyn923,2,Mon Jul 20 21:16:20 2015 UTC,"Enclosures that are too big aren't really the problem. It's wide open spaces that cause stress. As long as you clutter it up with fake plants, hides, branches, etc. the snake should do just fine."
snakes,3dza3m,SlyBlackDragon,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:35:33 2015 UTC,"By 'glass home' I'm assuming you mean a tank, which is definitely not what you want to keep a CRB (or BRB) in. Glass tanks notoriously lose heat and humidity more quickly than any other type of setup. If you do want to upgrade from tubs, check out Vision, Boaphile, or any other high-quality PVC cage manufacturer"

Bonnie is a striped het ghost corn. She kind of reminds me of a red garter snake. When I got Bonnie I used my hand to transfer her to her cage, as well as get a photo, and that was a mistake.
