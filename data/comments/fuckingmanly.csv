Especially with no weight limit Grand Prix, it was just so much more entertaining, the ref even wear camera on the head for better viewing angle. The height of pride was Grand Prix 2006, every fight in there was amazing, one of the fight was thompson vs fujita were just hamering each other to the point where blood flew on the camera like it was in some movie, it was so exciting to watch, i havent got that excited with any of the ufc events.

Each person's ""character"" is intended to represent someone who might actually have lived between the Fall of Rome and ~1600, and all the clothes and gear and whatnot are heavily researched and historically accurate.

To answer what's easily the most common question asked about SCA combat:  The weapons used are not foam-covered ""boffers,"" as you may have seen in the movie ""Role Models.""  They are solid 1.25""-2"" diameter lengths of rattan, wrapped in tape to prevent splintering.    Blows which land are called ""good"" or not by the recipient of the blow, with the benchmark being (roughly) ""If that were an actual sharpened blade, was there enough force that I would be severely injured or killed?""  Bruises and other minor injuries are par for the course - imagine being hit full-force with a baseball bat.

fuckingmanly,3bi0f4,TheOneTheOnlyC,7,Tue Jun 30 02:09:28 2015 UTC,"Here's from the original post on /r/streefights:  ""Mobsters file a police report regarding assault Three 'wise guys' that run a protection racket in a small Russian town were having a fun night at a local dive bar. One of them began to solicit a young woman. When she refused, the three tried dragging her into the VIP cabinet. At this time, her husband returned from the restroom and the argument was taken outside. Nikolai Vlasenko, an accomplished boxer, attempted to resolve the conflict peacefully. However, the 'guys that run the town', on their arrogant power trip, attacked the boxer with their fists. Notice how in the video, the two hooligans attack the boxer. Nikolai was forced to defend himself and threw his arms out in front of him. As Vlasenko's attorney asserts, the three intoxicated attackers ran into the defendant's outstretched hands, which the defendant put in front of himself to avoid being beaten. The recording has been passed on to the authorities. A preliminary investigation has confirmed the defendant's words, asserting that the hooligans misjudged their strength and ran into the outstretched hands on their own accord, knocking themselves out. In the meanwhile, the three bandits filed a police report, claiming that they were violently assaulted and received life-threatening injuries in the process. They are preparing to sue for damage to their health."" TL:DR; they stumbled and ran into his hands. LOL"

fuckingmanly,3bi0f4,TheBurningBeard,-10,Mon Jun 29 16:28:45 2015 UTC,that's some out of context rationalization if I ever heard it. throwing the first punch isn't self defense. It's a pre-emptive attack.
fuckingmanly,3bi0f4,ManCaveDaily,6,Mon Jun 29 18:35:38 2015 UTC,"Obviously I agree with the sentiment, but he's backing up. After what looks like they shove him, they advance on him, not only one opponent, but multiple--again while he's making space. They have clear intent to do him harm, and as the video shows if he waited for them to throw the first punch, he'd be a mess or dead.   I'm not talking about the legal ramifications of throwing the first point, I'm talking about trying not to get your head done in. The first guy who comes out is absolutely intending to fight. He charges right out of the pub, makes first contact, and then comes at the boxer.   TL;DR -- Don't fight. But don't get killed by a gang, either."

fuckingmanly,3bi0f4,xile,-2,Mon Jun 29 18:00:17 2015 UTC,"So what you're saying, is that he threw the first punch?"
fuckingmanly,3bi0f4,DirtLoves,4,Mon Jun 29 18:12:25 2015 UTC,"At a guy advancing on him, punching his palm, as the boxer is retreating, trying to make space, yes."

fuckingmanly,3bi0f4,TheBurningBeard,3,Mon Jun 29 21:31:12 2015 UTC,"Certainly he doesn't remember it.   He threw first but I think he's dead if he doesn't, those guys were slower but clear intent. The first guy drops his shoulder which sets him off. And with context (mob instigators) he's clearly justified.   Russia, man."
fuckingmanly,3bi0f4,HeresCyonnah,3,Mon Jun 29 21:36:22 2015 UTC,"check the video.  The first guy to get dropped clearly comes at him with a weak left @ 0:46, maybe it was a push but it looks more like a terrible, hasty punch.    I would say that he (the boxer) threw the second and third punches, but the first and second effect punches"
fuckingmanly,3bi0f4,TheBurningBeard,-7,Tue Jun 30 02:38:47 2015 UTC,"so if 2 guys ""come at him"", which in this case is simply walking towards him with their hands down, and he drops them, it seems to me there were other nonviolent options at his disposal."

He raised me as his own from the age of one and never once made me feel like I was anything but his son.  He always did whatever he had to to provide for me and my sisters and never bitched about it. I learned most of my manly skill set from him but what I value most is what he didn't always overtly teach- a sense of honor; the value of doing what you say, always telling the truth, and standing up for your beliefs.  Nothing more fucking manly than that. Now that I'm a father of a blended family he is still the benchmark against which I measure myself daily.  My biological father is pretty great too, and I have a great relationship with them both, but I am what I am because of a man that chose to love and raise me."

He could drive a screw with his thumbnail, tie a fishing line with one hand and his teeth, curse out the meanest sons of bitches he came across, and still have enough of a heart left to play with his grandkids.  My favorite story about him was when he was in his later years. He had deteriorated quite a bit and didn't get around much anymore, but when his son (my uncle) asked him, more out of courtesy than out of genuine belief that it might happen, if he wanted to go deer hunting with him, the auldfella said yes. They trekked through the woods for a few hours.  Yadda, yadda, yadda, they saw a deer. My uncle told him to go ahead and take the shot. Gramps lifted his rifle and sighted a moment. After a long pause sighting through the scope, he whispered, ""Bang."" Then he looked at my uncle and said, ""OK, let's go home."" He just wanted to see whether he could do it again, and he could. He didn't need the deer to prove anything to anyone. Just the mere fact that he could do it was enough.  My uncle told me the story. I've never seen more genuine joy on a person's face than I saw on my uncle's as he told it to me.  I miss that grizzled old man. I was a pall bearer at his funeral on my seventeenth birthday.

fuckingmanly,39xci1,Staghound_,3,Tue Jun 16 12:20:58 2015 UTC,"My Grand Father, he joined the Marine Corps, after Pearl Harbor. I like to imagine him sitting on his parents ranch, as a young man, reading the newspaper. Putting it down and saying ""well, sounds like this herohito jackass, needs an ass kicking."" Than going out and enlisting. Knowing what i know of him, that's probably not far off. He was a Marine, the reason i am too. He was hyper competent as well, the sort of guy, who would listen to your car running and say ""sounds like you are about to have tranny issues"" and than do a tranny swap on your car, in the parking lot, in under three hours, just because he was that guy. The one who would make sure, you were okay.  When he retired, he devoted more time to charity work. Thats where one of my favorite stories of him comes from. He was volunteering at the food bank. An obviously pregnant woman came in, with about four kids, she spoke spainish, and he didn't. But by the time he was done helping her, she was like a fifth child, and her kids were calling him pop (what his grandkids called him) he walked her out to the car, carrying her groceries. Because there was no way in hell, pop was going to let a pregnant woman carry anything.  Come to find out, her boyfriend was hanging out in the car, the whole time. So, Pop didn't like that. He yoked the guy out of the car, and gets in his face, makes him load all the groceries in the car, and just generally makes him feel two inches tall. Guy was apparently a gang banger, and my grandfather knew that. He didn't care. That was just the man he was. If he thought you were a piece of shit, you were going to know it. If you didn't know how to do something, he would teach you. If you were in a bind, any bind, he would help you. He was a goddamn man!"

He challenged people to think, then was charged and found guilty of corrupting the youth. He waived a chance to escape his execution feeling that running away would only invalidate his character and what he preached. Some people may say that it was stupid. But you have to have a strong manly character to stand up for what you believe in, especially in the face of certain death."

fuckingmanly,39l7w3,enestatli,10,Fri Jun 12 14:43:14 2015 UTC,It should be noted that using a tourniquet when bitten by a venomous animal is not really recommended. Some venoms have a relatively minor local effect but a serious systemic effect and other venoms have a serious local effect. And then there are questions as to how effective a tourniquet actually is in preventing further envenomation. So there is no consensus that you should use tourniquets in fact it is generally not recommended. In the case of Coral snakes they have a potent neurological venom so there is an argument to make that it is better to keep the venom confined to the bitten limb. It kills you by shutting down your respitory system and if it can't out of the arm in sufficent quantity that would be a good thing but it hasn't really been shown that tourniquets work very well in this regard.  Pressure immobilisation is a technique that is recommended in Australia (because they have a lot of animals with neurotoxic venoms).  Edit: Phrasing.
fuckingmanly,39l7w3,Toby-one,4,Fri Jun 12 15:39:21 2015 UTC,Is a tourniquet going to have negative effects in some cases?
fuckingmanly,39l7w3,erondites,3,Fri Jun 12 17:26:10 2015 UTC,If you are envenomated by a toxin that causes localised damage for example if you are bitten by a snake that causes the local tissue to die and turn necrotic then restricting the blood flow back to the body will cause the venom to build up in the limb and can make it worse. Also especially for longer duration restricting the blood flow into a limb will also cause tissue damage so it can get pretty bad. In some cases it has led to gangrene which can be fatal and in other cases it has just lead to the limb being amputated at the hospital.  So in some cases putting a tourniquet on will cause additional damage. In OPs case the venom was mainly neurotoxic that means that the venom had to go back into the body to cause maximum damage so in that case there is a case for restricting blood flow. But since you mainly need to restrict the backflow into the body you need to put pressure on the venous system and that you can do more effectively with the technique that I linked to above (At least according to Australian physicians although there is not much evidence either way on this technique).
fuckingmanly,39l7w3,Toby-one,1 point,Fri Jun 12 18:04:28 2015 UTC,Yes but that is only applicable to when you are talking about leaky limbs not when you are talking about envenomated limbs.

The reason diesels particularly older disesls like this model of truck (88-89)can go underwater reasonably easy is that they are not reliant on spark plugs which need a spark which comes from a battery such as a car or any petrol ignition system. Instead diesels rely on glow plugs which burn the diesel at a much higher temperature and are injected with fuel and are a ""Sealed system"" meaning that the only thign you have to really do to get a diesel to run underwater is make sure the air intake is above the water"

fuckingmanly,38b68p,autowikibot,5,Wed Jun 3 02:26:48 2015 UTC,"Soju:       Soju (Hangul: 소주; hanja: 燒酒) is a distilled beverage containing ethanol and water. It is usually consumed neat.  Considered as ""Korea's most popular alcoholic beverage"" in 2010,  most brands of soju are made in South Korea. While it is traditionally made from rice, wheat, or barley, modern producers often replace rice with other starches such as potatoes, sweet potatoes, or tapioca.  Soju is clear and colorless. Its alcohol content varies from about 16.7% to 45% alcohol by volume (ABV) for traditional Andong soju,  with 20% ABV being most common. However, by using freeze distillation, ABV can be increased to the desired percentage. There are two different ways to produce soju: the classic way of distilling soju that uses the single distillation method, and the modern way of diluted soju that uses the chain distillation method.  Distilled soju usually has a higher ABV of 30–35% than diluted soju with ABV of 21–30%, and therefore a stronger smell. Its popularity is in part due to its relatively low price in Korea: A typical 375 mL bottle of soju costs the consumer 1,000 to 3,000 South Korean won. Soju is exported to 80 countries and is in the top market share of diluted alcohol market. Statistically, soju ranked number one in world sale records of the diluted alcohol market in 2002.

But that being said, I'm also incredibly humbled and thankful that those sacrifices are made.  If we don't celebrate their sacrifice with joyful celebration of the opportunities we have all had because of them, then I feel like we are doing the fallen disservice. Pay your respects to them by living the life they made possible for you, and that they couldn't live. Be Happy  That being said, I agree with the part about the greeting of happy memorial day, because it treats the day like any other holiday and the part about people who're jazzed about having the day off but don't really look passed that.  edit: IDK if I articulated that response as well as I could have, but I think you guys will understand what i'm talking about"

So that we can feel free to have a beer, fire up the BBQ and have a happy Memorial Day in the greatest country this planet has seen, or ever will see. I think it's perfectly fine to say Happy Memorial Day. I'm happy that we have a military comprised of volunteers who are willing to lay down their lives so I can have a happy day being a free man.

fuckingmanly,36e1w2,totally_rocks,8,Mon May 18 21:28:12 2015 UTC,"Its not just holding in the water that you are getting by doing this. If your steak is cooked correctly it should be very tender and juicy. You can get very juicy steaks that dont leak all over your plate. Just because you end up with a lot of liquid on your plate does not mean you have created a juicy steak and visa vera, just because your steak isnt leaking all over your plate does not mean it wont have a juicy flavor profile. Buy good cuts of meat and try this method. You will end up with much better steaks. But if you prefer dry, overcooked steak (some people like well done steaks, although I think they are nuts) then by all means keep cooking them however you want. To each his own I guess."

fuckingmanly,36ayfj,racerx21,8,Mon May 18 04:44:51 2015 UTC,"I used to know the actual name of the nazi camp he was held in. I will try to find it and let you know. He was there for close to a year if I remember correctly. He said he survived by stealing the apples they would feed horses in the camp . He suffered from frostbite in his feet during his imprisonment.  He never spoke much about his time as a POW and I never asked how he got the purple heart. He was very disturbed by the whole experience because he lost a lot of friends. In his 90s he had a flashback and attacked a senior in his assisted living home with a walking cane, thinking he was a nazi.  I know that he was in a tank battalion in a dental group, not sure what that meant. He was drafted for the Braves to be the pitcher but declined it. After the war he wanted to spend time at home with his wife and newborn baby, my grandmother. He could still throw a ball even in his older years!  I also believe there was some kind of confusion with his purple heart medal. I don't know if he ever actually got the medal itself, but I know he was awarded the honor of it due to being injured in combat upon capture. Like I said above I don't know the specifics of the injury but it was during his capture that he was injured.  Edit: For anyone interested this is a document showing some interesting information about his POW/MIA status including the camp he was held in and eventually liberated from.  http://www.ww2pow.info/index.php?page=directory&rec=23236  Grandpa passed away a few years ago at 93. He lived a very humble and exciting life.  When he passed away, he willed me his beloved handgun that he bought new out of a sears catalogue in 1952/1953?  http://imgur.com/a/DE2y2 It's a Ruger Mark I .22. He loved shooting his gun, and you can see the wear he put on it. I can remember as a little boy shooting with him at the river by his house.  Edit 2: My first Gold! It's been a pleasure sharing memories of my great grandfather with you all. He was an amazing man and made such an impact on my life. Cherish your elders while you still can.

Another awesome thing about Patton:  He has this reputation of being old ""Blood and Guts"" as if he sacrificed the lives of his men willy-nilly.  Patton had the philosophy that it was better to expend a little more blood now than a lot more blood later.  IOW, he believed his short term losses would be mitigated in the long term by bringing a battle (or the war) to as swift a conclusion as possible....even if that meant more lives early-on.  Historically, this ended up being the case with a couple of notable exceptions (Metz being one).  In reference to the quote, it's also interesting that Patton was actually far more forgiving of his staff and officers under his command for mistakes.  Patton would cuss the hell out of them, but he always gave them an opportunity to learn and correct their mistakes.  On the other hand....Bradley fired something like 2-3x more subordinates than Patton did.  Bradley, ""The GI's General"" routinely fired and sacked officers resulting in a much higher turnover rate that put green officers in command positions often over seasoned veterans whom he fired.  This almost certainly resulted in a greater loss of life for the men under the command of those officers."

Normally, the tank crews would simply bail out and make their way back to the safety of their lines but Patton would order them all to attack as regular foot infantry.

Their roar always sounds weak on recordings (in many, almost like they're dry heaving), but you can hear it pretty clearly up to 2 miles away (5km).  It's powerful enough that the pressure condenses the air in their throat, so if you watch a video of a lion roaring head-on, you can see vapor form and dissipate as they roar.  Needless to say, it's probably a bit intimidating, even to multiple crocs, who really shouldn't be threatened by a lone lion halfway in the water."

Decided jumping out of planes for a living was too boring and decided to become an aircrewmen in a helicopter regiment in 1986. Did a tour in Afghanistan in 1987-88 as part of a helicopter crew. After going for a tan in the Afghan sun, he returned and served in Germany. After retiring from the military and working with a Soviet Afghan veterans program he became restless and bought his own equipment and fought as a mercenary in Kosovo. In 1999 he reenlisted for Chechen War 2 to participate in the counter insurgency. During this time, from 1999-2007, he did over 10 tours in Chechnya. In 2003, he stepped on a mine and lost his foot.  He was able to remain in the forces due to his superior physique.  in 2005, he single-handedly fought off an ambush on his patrol. 15 days after that incident, he was wounded by an RPG, despite this, managed to destroy the RPG team and a machine gun nest, and continue leading the patrol. This earned him the Hero of the Russian Federation. In 2008 in the South Ossetia, he commanded special forces units On April 27, 2012, he was killed in a motorcycle accident, following a long line of badasses being killed in Motor-vehicle accidents, from T.E.

In the wild an animal has the opportunity to live it's life how nature intended it to. The animal can roam where ever it chooses to, mate when it wants to, and eats a natural diet. If a hunter can accurately hit said animal with a bullet or arrow in the proper place, they will feel very little pain and die almost instantly."

fuckingmanly,33c44z,RedneckHippie111,6,Tue Apr 21 14:53:02 2015 UTC,"African Elephants are not endangered.  They are listed as ""vulnerable."" Many guided elephant hunts are done as culls of unhealthy or problem animals from healthy herds.  They are going to be killed anyway, and the cost of a tag benefits the conservation of the rest of the herd.  All of the meat is used by the local people, who also work for the guide service.  Poaching is still an issue, but by managing herds, and even providing legitimate hunting opportunities, it gives conservationists and the local people more ability and incentive to combat illegal killings."
fuckingmanly,33c44z,wienercat,-2,Wed Apr 22 02:17:23 2015 UTC,They cull the population to prevent the elephants from destroying crops. They need to be managed because their habitats are being destroyed.  They've been managing their own populations just fine for hundreds of thousands of years.
fuckingmanly,33c44z,dustlesswalnut,6,Wed Apr 22 05:23:50 2015 UTC,"Not on these managed reserves they aren't.  To keep good management practices, you occasionally cull the injured, elderly, or genetically deficient to ensure the survival and growth of the healthy herd.  They did manage their own populations just fine until humans fucked it up.  Now humans are trying to fix the problem they created.  Which requires a lot of money.  If the herds go away, the hunters (and their money) go away, so they keep growing the herds to keep the hunters (and their money) coming back."
fuckingmanly,33c44z,wienercat,2,Wed Apr 22 07:05:26 2015 UTC,"Look I'm all for conservation of land and all animals. But we need a place to live as well. And for that to happen we need land. Which means habitat is encroached upon. When this happens, you get animals that come into our land and can either, endanger lives, destroy property, or become a nuisance.   Elephants are hunted based on those last three. Every year the african government releases permits for specific elephants, because they are becoming a problem in some way. Not just ""One elephant in X area.""   The african governments actually do well at regulating legal hunting within their borders. Curbing poaching is a different story when you have millions of square miles for 50 rangers to cover and protect at all times."
fuckingmanly,33c44z,OlafTheBlack,-2,Tue Apr 21 13:18:50 2015 UTC,The African governments also lie about total numbers in their herds to justifiy the licenses they make tons of money on. A recent aerial photography study showed that in one country the population was around 40k when the government said it was more than twice that.
fuckingmanly,33c44z,bob_smoosh,2,Tue Apr 21 17:04:12 2015 UTC,"Got a source? If you are talking about things like Gazelle, Wildebeest, or other herd animals, those are given out permits in huge numbers, purely because there is so many of them.  They really don't make a lot of money off of it. If they did, they wouldn't have the problem with lacking enough rangers to patrol their sanctuaries.   I don't see your point. You are saying they are lying that the numbers seem smaller. Which why would that mean it's bad to issue more permits"

fuckingmanly,33c44z,danthezombieking,15,Tue Apr 21 17:32:26 2015 UTC,"As a hunter there are several things to be said here.   A little background info first. I have hunted all my life. I enjoy venison, and use as much of the meat as I can, down to the neck muscles in ground meat. Anyone who eats venison should get as much of it as possible. However, I also hunt for large deer. This is in part as a result of wanting the animal to grow older and have as much meat as possible (they also happen to get larger antlers).   With that being said, even as someone who hunts for meat, there is a certain exhilaration that comes with shooting an animal that you have selected and put time and effort into getting close enough to kill. It's hard to describe why this is, but it is a rush. There is also remorse for taking a beautiful animal that I know has been walking gracefully for four or five years. It's a strange dichotomy.   I go back and forth on trophy hunting. In the case of hunting giraffes, the hunters can claim that they're helping local people and conservation (which they are), but that isn't why they decide to hunt. They want the rush that I described, and they want to have a beautiful animal that they can preserve tangibly. It's literally in their house. As I said, I go back and forth on whether that rush is an acceptable motive to hunt.   What is undeniable, though, is that even if they are hunting purely for the rush, all meat from these animals are given to the local people, and the money spent both helps conservation efforts and employs locals as trackers and guides. It seems counter-intuitive, but hunters  in Africa (and around the globe) do more for conservation than any other group. Yeah, hunters want the resource to hunt, but without the money from hunting many of the game preserves in Africa would not exist, and poachers would run rampant.   Here is a link where Chris Pratt articulates the hunting experience in a very beautiful way."

(Nikon lenses only work on Nikon cameras)  Edit - forgot to add that it's usually cheaper to repair slightly damaged equipment than it is to replace it.  I've bought lenses for $50 that were worth $500, repaired them for like $60 and had a pretty awesome rig for a fraction of the original price.

fuckingmanly,3358qw,saargrin,1 point,Mon Apr 20 21:45:07 2015 UTC,The device I saw demonstrated was mostly intended for covert breaching of ship hulls. It was basically a parabolic shaped piece of soft metal  (copper or brass I think) with a charge behind it. Once it goes off the metal basically folds backwards on itself and penetrates the hull as if it were a slug. It's the side of a rolling suitcase and it's supposed to be able to put holes in warships.  I think it's mostly for underwater applications but it was demonstrated above water and one guy could easily handle it. Concealment would be a problem though. Couldn't slap it on the back of a lot of modern wartanks because of the exhaust...   Maybe it could be used if an MBT were to go into a parking garage or something and the thing could be rigged from above or hidden in a softer vehicle a tank would roll by. I dunno.

You couldn't cut them down with a lawn mower or weed eater because the stalks were very hard, but they were also hollow?

(They were not employees or members of any of the federal land management agencies, as far as I know.)  I believe the EMTs and paramedics were getting paid their regular wages but for 24 hours a day.

fuckingmanly,325zj3,harshreverb,3,Sat Apr 11 16:51:29 2015 UTC,What's the pay?
fuckingmanly,325zj3,harshreverb,2,Sat Apr 11 00:08:47 2015 UTC,"If you have no prior fire experience, you will apply for and start off as a GS-3, earning a little over $12 an hour (unless your duty station is within a locality which allows you to receive a pay rate adjustment to offset the cost of living, then it could be much more).  Here is the federal government's GS pay scale: http://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/pay-leave/salaries-wages/2014/general-schedule/     When you are not on a fire assignment, you are getting paid your base rate (~$12) x 40 hours a week. 80 hours bi-weekly.   However, when you are on a fire assignment, you work 16 hour shifts. You will be paid your base rate for the first eight hours and overtime for the latter eight hours of your shift. If you step foot on the fire line, even if it is for 5 minutes, you will receive hazard pay (25% of your base pay) for the entire 16 hour shift.  Law mandates that one is allowed to work 14 operational shifts on a fire assignment. This does not include travel days getting to and from the fire.      Take this example:     Your crew is just about done for the day after training and working for eight hours. Then, your crew receives orders to head to a fire assignment in a neighboring state 200 miles away. Your crew loads up and begins driving to the fire. By the end of the day, you've been on shift for 13 hours.     Travel day:       $12 x 8 hours = $96 $18 x 5 hours = $90      Your crew then proceeds to work a full 14 day roll beginning the next morning.     Shift 1:   $12 (base pay rate) x 8 hours = $96 $18 (overtime pay rate) x 8 hours = $144 $3 (hazard pay rate) x 16 hours = $48      Gross pay for shift #1= $288     After 14 long days, your crew is finally released from the assignment and is cleared to head back to your duty station.     $288 (gross pay for one full 16 hour shift) x 14 shifts = $4032     Travel day 2:   $12 x 6 hours (travel) = $72     Because your crew has worked a full 14 day roll, you must take a mandatory two days off. You receive pay during these two R&R days.      $12 x 8 = $96 (R&R day #1) $12 x 8 = $96 (R&R day #2).      Finally, your crew convenes again after the 2nd rest day and is back on the national dispatch system as available. Lucky for you and your crew, your superintendent receives orders to report to yet another fire assignment.... that one turns out to be a full 14 day roll as well.   I will end the example here, but you can imagine how you begin to accumulate money over the course of the fire season     In summary:      Travel day 1: $186 Shifts 1 - 14: $4032 Travel day 2: $72 Two R&R days: $192        Gross earnings: $4482      Not bad for $12/hour. Now imagine six or seven full 14 day rolls (fire assignments) during the course of your fire season."

So he beat the man to death with his bare hands: as in didn't hit the guy's with an object or on the counter or something, literally punched him in the face till he was gone. In the resulting trial, the father was found not guilty on the basis that his daughter wasn't capable of defending herself, so his actions were legally considered an extension of her own self-defense.

History of article  Cooper%27s Hill Cheese-Rolling and Wake:       This ceremony originally took place each Whit Monday before later transferred to the Spring Bank Holiday. Two possible origins have been proposed for the ceremony. The first is said that it evolved from a requirement for maintaining grazing rights on the common.   The second proposal is pagan origins for the custom of rolling objects down the hill. It is thought that bundles of burning brushwood were rolled down the hill to represent the birth of the New Year after winter. Connected with this belief is the traditional scattering of buns, biscuits and sweets at the top of the hill by the Master of Ceremonies. This is said to be a fertility rite to encourage the fruits of harvest.   Since the fifteenth century [citation needed] the cheese has been rolled down the hill, and people have competed to catch it.     Parent commenter can toggle NSFW or delete.

The objective is for the male to carry the female through a special obstacle track in the fastest time. The sport was first introduced at Sonkajärvi, Finland.  Several types of carry may be practised: piggyback, fireman's carry (over the shoulder), or Estonian-style (the wife hangs upside-down with her legs around the husband's shoulders, holding onto his waist).  Wife Carrying World Championships are held annually in Sonkajärvi, Finland since 1992 (where the prize depends on the wife's weight in beer).    Image i - The ""Estonian Carry"".

During the battle of Lexington and Concord, he had sons who decided they were too old to fight and stayed home to tend the farm.   Sam, though, mustered with his 'alarm list' of fellow militiamen and went to fight. His comrades wanted to take up a more protected position, but he went alone to a spot closer to the road where the regulars would pass, and fired on them. A platoon of redcoats came to deal with him. He shot one with his musket, one with each pistol, and went to draw his sword. They shot him in the face, bayoneted him, beat him with the butts of their muskets, and left him for dead.  At the conclusion of these festivities, his fellow militiamen went to retrieve his body. They found him propped up on one arm, trying to reload his musket with the other. They laid him on a door and took him to Dr. Cotton Tufts, who did what he could to make him comfortable, but still expected him to die.   And eighteen years later, die he did."

I've seen a few obvious cases of absurd muscle growth, like that famous bicep dude, but outside of extreme examples like that it's difficult for a layman like myself to tell the difference.  Thanks for the explanation."

After a while, and after hanging around the right groups for a while, you start to pick up on it. There was a thread in /r/weightroom, I recall, which was an AMA type thing about steroids.

If their back muscle is more developed than their chest. Because you use your back in almost every exercise. So on any day other you're still doing back. On steroid users the muscles accumulates faster.

fuckingmanly,2ygwy6,Flaxmoore,3,Mon Mar 9 19:54:08 2015 UTC,Why salt water as opposed to fresh water? And just how salty?
fuckingmanly,2ygwy6,Dauthdaertya,7,Mon Mar 9 21:34:16 2015 UTC,The salt water boils at a slightly higher temperature and reduces the difference between blade and quench temp. This reduces thermal shock and warping or cracking. I always go supersaturated- until salt crystals won't dissolve.
fuckingmanly,2ygwy6,Flaxmoore,3,Mon Mar 9 23:18:09 2015 UTC,"Just keep in mind that the choice to use oil vs. water also changes the molecular properties of the steel.  Using oil creates a surface layer of very high carbon steel where the carbon in the oil alloys with the developing Iron crystalline structure during the cooling process.  The higher carbon steel is harder and much better at holding an edge, though it is more brittle than lower carbon steel, (which is why you wouldn't want it to be that alloy through the entire thickness of the blade).  This material change, and the bond between helps create better overall strength properties and edge properties for the larger blades.  You won't get that effect from the Salt water, though as you mention the differing temperature gradiant changes both the overall thermal shock and the crystalline structure formation properties slightly.  That's all assuming I remember any of my material science classes correctly, however, and I acknowledge now that I may be wrong."
fuckingmanly,2ygwy6,TheStupidBurns,2,Tue Mar 10 11:33:29 2015 UTC,A blade smith will generally reheat it at a lower temperature after hardening to temper the blade and remove some of the brittleness put into it by the quench. And with high quality axes they may forge weld a harder steel into the cutting edge and harden it in an oil quench while leaving the remaining steel behind the impact surface soft.

Edit: Just wanted to add to what I had: I don't know if the range is any better, but the crossbow was the preferred weapon during night/stealth ops. They were used specifically  to kill silently and to takeout sentries. They were able to penetrate Kevlar from pretty far distances, which I don't think many handguns could do at the time. Crossbows were also a better option than handguns for operations that required the SF to emerge from water, because some guns during that time were carried in a water-proof bag, which was cumbersome to carry and it took time to get the gun out. Keep in mind, the MP5 for MARCOS was the primary weapon. The crossbow was only used for specific situations."

AADs are typically used to open the reserve parachute container at a preset altitude if the descent rate exceeds a preset activation speed.  This indicates that the user has not opened his or her parachute, or that the parachute is malfunctioning and is not slowing the descent rate sufficiently.  The older style mechanical AADs are falling out of fashion in favour of the newer style electronic-pyrotechnic models. The built-in computers in the newer models can make much better estimates of the altitude and the vertical speed, therefore making the units more reliable than the older types.

fuckingmanly,2vgt8s,CloudDrone,-6,Wed Feb 11 09:43:15 2015 UTC,"No, Im saying that nothing about this is inherently manly. I dont care if the other gender could also do it, its just not manly! Its simply being a good cunt.  This sub exists to share examples of the state of being a man. Being nice to someone or having good will just isnt a manly thing, its what good men do. Maybe this should be posted on /r/fuckingselfless, because that would be more appropriate.  I mean whats the point of categorization if its all just thrown anywhere due to vague correlations?"
fuckingmanly,2vgt8s,SovietMacguyver,2,Wed Feb 11 00:49:10 2015 UTC,"Its not just being selfless though. He would still fit on this sub if he did iron man after iron man with a huge sandbag. The level of training The fact that he's doing it with his twin brother who never got a chance is also an expression of what it means to be a man. To take it upon yourself to raise up those you love, and do what you can to involve them in great things. This particular guy just went above and beyond what he was able to do by taking it further.   He worked way harder than he needed to, to be able to train and perform in these physically grueling exercises, so that he could also make it possible for his twin brother to come along with him. The discipline required to work through the pain of running a race with just yourself is already incredible. To have the discipline to train hard enough for two people is just beyond that, even. And he does it over and over. He stays at that level of fitness and continues training at that level. That consistency is another manly quality in someone like this.  This isn't just what a good person would do, because absolutely nobody expects everybody (or even anybody) who is a good person to carry another human being on an iron man race. Nobody even expects good people to do an iron man race.  To me, this is way fucking manly."
fuckingmanly,2vgt8s,jw121287,-2,Wed Feb 11 01:10:18 2015 UTC,"Ok, didnt realize it was his brother. That makes more of a case. Blood loyalty is manly.  Look, I get that some traditionally feminine attributes such as caring for others, empathy, etc, can sometimes be regarded as manly. Thats a result of gender equality, and I dont have a problem with it in general. But just because theres a man in the picture and you like what hes doing doesnt make it manly, thats all Im saying."

If he was pulling your ass, you'd just be along for the ride, but this is a different case.

People are poor, starving, homeless, without healthcare, being killed in wars and society doesn't do anything to solve the systemic problems that cause this.  But one media-savvy first-world middle-class guy talks about his problems to the media and set up a donation page and boom, he hits the jackpot and gets ten times what he asked for.  In a more rational world, people would stop donating at a certain point (or donate to a more general charity) and maybe the whole thing would start a debate about how society can take better care of the disabled and children growing up with single parents.  EDIT: From the other article:   Forrest, who works as a freelance business contractor, has plans for he and Leo to move to his native country of New Zealand where he said they'll receive support from loved ones.

The kid is essentially going to have all the mental capacities of a soggy potato. What's going to happen when he dies? The child sure as hell won't be able to get married, they'll exist in government care living on whatever benefits they afford to them.  But of course, all of that doesn't matter because other people have it worse? Fuck off.   Let me ask you a serious question. Have you ever cared for someone who was physically incapable of taking care of themselves?"
fuckingmanly,2uze6s,internetpersondude,3,Sat Feb 7 00:56:10 2015 UTC,"You also don't get my central point. People born with Down Syndrome are 1/1000 of the global population, which gives us 7.29 Million people with DS.  Let's multiply that with the rate of single parent households of 15.9% (Source. Might not represent the true global rate, but it's the best I could find in a minute.)  That would mean 1.16 Million people with Down Syndrome grew up or are growing up with a single parent. One of those parents is now showered with money, way beyond the point of what he needs, because his story was hyped by the media. The rest are pretty much the same situation and suffer in silence. How much of an asshole the wife was is irrelevant. I'm not saying he should get nothing directly, but it wood make sense to stop donating after he's reached his funding goal.  If you read about a person with Alzheimers, ALS, cancer, HIV or whatever, it just doesn't make a lot of sense to donate hundreds of thousands of dollars to that single person. It alleviates less suffering than donating to a charity for all sufferers of that condition."
fuckingmanly,2uze6s,MrPennywhistle,2,Sat Feb 7 01:13:33 2015 UTC,"I'm questioning the whole media hype situation here.  If you want to give to charity, you should make sure that the cause you give your money to is meaningful and actually helps people. This man has now been helped more than enough. If you are moved by this guy's story and you see that he's already gotten $400,000 in donations, you could give money to an organization that helps people with the same kind of problem instead of making a rich man richer."

It's not an easy thing to raise a child that needs extra help but this is ridiculous.   My birth mom decided to give me up for adoption because she was very young and single. Plus she knew my mother and father personally and that they couldn't have kids but she still didn't take it lightly. In my opinion even tho its going to be harder for him now he and his son are better off without a mother like that in their lives.
fuckingmanly,2uze6s,answerstothedream,3,Fri Feb 6 23:22:31 2015 UTC,For the child's sake its better if it doesn't follow her at all because then she would be one of those mothers who gives up a child for adoption only to file a case when the child is 3 or 4 to reclaim him.

It is not like the old days when mastery of horsemanship, troop management, choice of field, and use of a melee weapon could keep even a king somewhat safe.  Artillery doesn't give a fuck.  Do you think there would be fewer wars if presidents and members of congress served on the front lines while in office?  If they found a way to survive they would not have to spend 80% of their time campaigning for reelection. I would much rather risk being killed than spend week after week doing cold calls in a cubicle.  Hell they would start wars just to get away from that for a while if they had a chance at surviving.  They would forget about job training and fixing infrastructure to focus on better defensive gear for soldiers and monuments to their own martial glory.

That's what I'm suggesting. It's easy to send thousands to fight while you sit home in your pent house but if leaders had to live in country and made direct and active military decisions they might make different decisions. No I don't think Obama needs to be standing on the front lines with a rifle but it would be an interesting change in the way we do things if war wasn't so detached

fuckingmanly,2uix7a,autowikibot,16,Mon Feb 2 16:58:02 2015 UTC,"It's a subjective term used to communicate the amount of resources estimated to combat the fire effectively. It depends on where the fire is (the responding fire department). It's useful because a 2 alarm fire in the rural setting (small fire dept) versus New York City (larger fire dept) still communicates the same message: This is bigger than a 1 alarm, but smaller than a 3 alarm.  You're not wrong about there being 3 alarms typically, but it's not an official term, or rather, not globally consistent. A 3 alarm is the biggest typical fire someone will have to fight, so a 4-alarm is moving away from standard emergencies (this shit's getting real). I imagine a 6-alarm is a ""holy shit"" kind of scenario with lots of departments involved. By this measurement you could have things like 10-alarm and 30-alarm fires, but without lower precendents to define these higher levels (how did we respond to that 29-alarm fire) then the numbers don't communicate much.

fuckingmanly,2u2a7o,tossitwhenurdone,6,Thu Jan 29 12:17:57 2015 UTC,"Some fun facts about why you are wrong: UFC was founded in November, 1993. Where as Pride was established in October, 1997. By the time Pride held its first tournament, UFC was already doing away with open tournament style championships and refining the rules and list of acceptable combative strikes. They had 15 events by the time Pride was born. They had named more than 20 champions. Change came under the pressure of Senator McCain and under threat of an all out nation wide ban of the sport. Pride was literally in direct response to the pressure UFC was facing in America to legitimize the sport. Without UFC, there might not even be a pride. UFC did it first, with less rules, no weight classes through more adversity, for longer. Where is Pride now?    While I understand the nostalgic need to coddle the image that Pride was some how better,  I think people only admire it as so because it  was what the UFC couldn't afford to be. A rule-less, open class, tourney style mma championship. It carried on the purist traditions for the UFC while the UFC could no longer. But to imply that Pride is some how a more original UFC is just wrong."

My buddy and I (wearing white jeans, a white fur jacket and a white NY Yankees Beanie) were walking down a pedestrian shopping area after the shops were closed the middle of Hiroshima trying to find a club (we were lost). The area at night turns into a teenage hangout. So we re just strolling and a white car drives by really fast and really close to us repeatedly and really fast, on the third drive by my buddy kicks the car. the cars stops just a few feet in from of us and five teenage gang members step out. They all had on early 2000s boy-band thematic clothes. they were pissed and we were scared, like ""oh shit what did we get into."" They started making a lot of noise and I heard a lot of english ""fuck you""s and ""bitch"" they had us both both agains a roll down gate of a store and they were banging on it and just making a lot of noise. intimidating us and all that, it worked, we were scared for like 3 minutes, then we realized that this wasn't escalating, so we stopped apologizing in fear and kicked asses. I was 200 lbs at 6 ft, he was 230 and just a bit shorter than me They were teens the oldest one 18 at most, the biggest one was probably 5'9'' at 150. We didn't destroy them, but but we held out long enough for the cops to show up as some of the onlookers called them, its easy to say that we won. When the cops showed up and broke up the fight they couldn't decided who's fault it was so they let all 7 of us go. But waiting on the other side of the street was about 8 more guys dressed just the same as these 5 guys, so we were like oh shit, back to being scared again. Until a mob of about 20 or so guys wearing all white NY yankees gear surrounded us and escorted us back to the area where the rest of the marine hung out. TL;DR Japanese street gangs are like the gangs in the Warriors."

fuckingmanly,2siog9,appgrad22,19,Thu Jan 15 14:52:59 2015 UTC,"TL;DR  In 458 BC, the Romans were fighting the Aequi and the Sabines. The consul Minucius Esquilinus had led an army against them, but had been trapped by the Aequians in the Alban Hills and was attempting to fight off a siege. A few Roman horsemen escaped and returned to Rome to tell the senate what had happened. The senate fell into a panic and authorized the other consul for the year, Horatius Pulvillus, to nominate a dictator. Horatius nominated Cincinnatus for a dictatorial term (also known as Magister Populi or ""Master of the People"") for six months.  A group of senators were sent to tell Cincinnatus that he had been nominated dictator. According to Livy, the senators found Cincinnatus while he was plowing on his farm. Cincinnatus cried out ""Is everything all right?"" They said to Cincinnatus that they hoped ""it might turn out well for both him and his country,"" and then they asked him to put on his senatorial toga and hear the mandate of the senate. He called to his wife, Racilia, telling her to bring out his toga from their cottage.  When he put on his toga, the senatorial delegation hailed him as dictator, and told him to come to the city. He then crossed the Tiber river in a boat provided by the senate, as his farm was on the far side of the river. When he reached the other side of the Tiber, he was greeted by his three sons and most of the senators. Several lictors were given to him for protection.  The next morning, Cincinnatus went to the Roman forum and nominated as his Master of the Horse (his second in command) Lucius Tarquitius, who was considered one of the finest soldiers in Rome. Cincinnatus then went to the Roman popular assembly and issued an order to the effect that every man of military age should report to the Campus Martius—the Field of Mars, god of war—by the end of the day.  Once the army assembled, Cincinnatus took them to fight the Aequi at the Battle of Mons Algidus. Cincinnatus led the infantry in person, while Tarquitius led the cavalry. The Aequi were surprised by the double attack and were soon cut to pieces. The commanders of the Aequi begged Cincinnatus not to slaughter them all.  Cincinnatus did not want to cause any unnecessary bloodshed, and told the Aequi that he would let them live if they submitted to him and brought their leader, Gracchus Cloelius, and his officers to him in chains. A yoke was set up, made up of three spears, and the Aequi had to pass under it in an act of submission, bowing down while confessing that they had been conquered. After this, the war ended and Cincinnatus disbanded his army. He then resigned his dictatorship and returned to his farm, a mere fifteen days after he had been nominated dictator."

fuckingmanly,2siog9,knuckles523,5,Fri Jan 16 04:42:45 2015 UTC,Cincinnatus was George Washinton's role model in his refusal to run for a third presidential term. That's fucking manly.

fuckingmanly,2siog9,shroom_throwaway9722,7,Thu Jan 15 23:12:40 2015 UTC,"That's not just an axe--that's a fasces, the Roman scepter of authority wielded by high officials, including and especially the Consuls and Dictator. It represents his authority to make or break any law, his power of life and death over every citizen of Rome. And here, he's either reluctantly accepting it when the Senate's representatives came to him on his farm, or surrendering it to return to his plow.  Cincinnatus wasn't the only Dictator of Rome, or even the first one--but he was the first Dictator appointed by the post-monarchical Romans, who had no memory of the tyranny of the Tarquin dynasty. He was one of the most beloved figures of his time--if he had kept his powers, ruled Rome wisely and justly for the rest of his life, very few people would have protested. He was the first Dictator who, realistically speaking, could have proclaimed himself king and chose not to."
fuckingmanly,2siog9,vincebarnes,-1,Mon Jan 19 17:14:20 2015 UTC,"Not a good guy:   Politically, Cincinnatus was a persistent opponent of attempts to improve the legal situation of the plebeians. His son Caeso Quinctius often drove the tribunes of the plebeians out from the forum, the heart of Roman political life, preventing them from reaching a formal decision."

fuckingmanly,2salvc,sailorJery,0,Wed Jan 14 01:49:14 2015 UTC,"If it's not relevant why make it an issue?   I'm not religious. But I know that if I were, I'd live my life very, very differently. How can you believe in an omnipotent, omnipresent, omniscient God and live the way so many people do? How can a Christian (for example) justify spending time on any activity that isn't directly related to serving God in the best way possible, or seeking a closer relationship with God?  That was kind of tangential to the original point though. I meant to say that if I thought I had a personal relationship with the creator of the universe and He wanted people to believe in Him, I'd be spreading the faith and trying to serve God, not to mention trying to secure eternal salvation for myself and everyone I meet. If I truly believed in such things and thought the stakes were as high as eternal salvation vs. eternal damnation, I'd be a fucking annoying religious person."
fuckingmanly,2salvc,dustlesswalnut,2,Wed Jan 14 05:12:48 2015 UTC,"That's just you in a hypothetical situation. It's all a matter of how you define your beliefs. Serving god doesn't have to mean streetcorner preaching or ringing doorbells, it can just be living a good life and praying for others. That's not very obnoxious. My grandfather was a VERY devout Catholic. Like went to church 7 days a week before work type religious. Not once did he ever try to change my views or tell me I was wrong. He believed his God would love me regardless. I have gay Christian friends and a friend who is an anarchist because he believes there can be no authority but God. Yeah there are totally extremists but mostly it boils down to personal faith, not a book or mandates from any specific church. Sorry for the rant."

It's a matter of wear and tear on the body with putting that much stress on it.  His form was good, he couldn't have done anything differently other than not lift it.

If he could do it lil over again, he would have stopped before he got hurt.  You know what's fucking manly? Not giving into bullshit bravado, and still being healthy enough to be a great father and grandfather. My grandfather's dying words to me were ""It's never worth it breaking your body for pride or a dollar."" He made me and my brother promise we wouldn't wreck ourselves like he did. He humbled himself as he lay dying in hopes a wouldn't repeat his mistakes. That's fucking manly."

fuckingmanly,2r9a6i,hevin-karvick,6,Sun Jan 4 01:25:43 2015 UTC,I don't know anything about baseball. What is a perfect game?
fuckingmanly,2r9a6i,webcamdad_56,5,Sun Jan 4 08:08:56 2015 UTC,"From wiki  A perfect game is defined by Major League Baseball as a game in which a pitcher (or combination of pitchers) pitches a victory that lasts a minimum of nine innings and in which no opposing player reaches base.[2] Thus, the pitcher (or pitchers) cannot allow any hits, walks, hit batsmen, or any opposing player to reach base safely for any other reason: in short, ""27 up, 27 down"". The feat has been achieved 23 times in MLB history."
fuckingmanly,2r9a6i,Marius_de_Frejus,2,Sun Jan 4 10:35:29 2015 UTC,"It's the best possible performance a pitcher can give, and the defense has to not make any errors as well. They're pretty rare. On average they happen less than once every five years — that's less than once every 12,000 games.  More detailed explanation, from scratch (assuming you weren't lying and you don't know ANYTHING about baseball):  Baseball is played between two teams of nine players. A game doesn't have a clock; rather, it lasts nine innings. In each inning, each team takes a turn at bat. During each team's turn, players cycle through the batting order one after the other. When a player has a turn at bat, he can either reach base or be put out. There are a few ways to get on base; some are considered the pitcher's fault (a ""hit"" or a ""walk""), while some are not (a ""fielding error"", when a defensive player screws up a play he should have handled routinely). When three players from a team get out, the teams switch and it's the other team's turn to hit. This happens nine times, and when the nine innings are done, the game is over (unless the teams are tied, in which case the game goes on until there is a winner).  On offense, the object is to score runs (get on base then run all the way around the bases without being touched with the ball). On defense, it's to prevent runs, so if you can prevent anyone from even getting on base, that's even better. The pitcher is sort of like the first line of defense -- it's his job to get the ball past the batter. If the batter hits the ball, it's up to the other defensive players to get him out. A perfect game is when a pitcher and defense do not allow one player on base the whole game. 27 opposing batters faced, 27 outs.  Do you like football (soccer)? If so, we could very roughly say that getting on base is like a team getting possession inside the attacking third, advancing through the bases is like a team getting the ball inside the opponent's penalty area, and scoring a run would be like a goal. A perfect game (again, very roughly) would be like if a football team didn't allow any goals, or even any shots, and played the entire game in their opponent's half of the field. It's total control by the defense, and especially by the pitcher."
fuckingmanly,2r9a6i,webcamdad_56,2,Sun Jan 4 18:25:47 2015 UTC,"Wow, thank you! Kind of reminds me of a game we used to play in school, brännboll, however I never heard of anyone who came anywhere near a score of zero. How many points do each team get in a typical game?"

More players get on base, but they get put out or the inning ends before they can score. Every year, the World Series goes from four to seven games; only once in 112 years has someone thrown a perfect game during the World Series.  These games all lasted between three and three and a half hours, except one which went to four hours.  Any other questions? I'm happy to chat :)  Where's brannböll played?

Also, getting shot is getting shot, for the most part.  I don't hear anyone making that ridiculous ""slower moving round"" argument for the NATO 5.56.  Truth is, 9mm, .380, .38 special, .357 magnum, .40, and .45 are pretty much the same when it comes to putting holes in people.  The only thing that matters is how many rounds you get.

fuckingmanly,2q1pti,Noob_tuba23,30,Mon Dec 22 06:40:43 2014 UTC,Can someone present this to Congress as proof of why we need to abolish shaving standards in the U.S. military?
fuckingmanly,2q1pti,Calamity_Jay,15,Mon Dec 22 11:53:53 2014 UTC,I was under the impression the shaving standards were set to ensure that gas masks could form a proper seal.
fuckingmanly,2q1pti,jacobthehunter,6,Mon Dec 22 16:40:25 2014 UTC,"That's usually given as the reason, but it doesn't make a lot of sense in practice. If you're in danger of an enemy gas attack and actually have a gas mask issued to you, then that would make sense. If you're stationed at a state-side base and don't have a gas mask issued to you it makes no sense.  When I was in the military, only specific personal, usually those being deployed to certain locations, had gas masks issued to them. There's not really any policy in place for everyone else to obtain a gas mask in an emergency. If they needed them for some reason, it would take hours, if not days (because bases don't keep enough on hand for everyone) to distribute them to all base personnel. It's safe to say that you wouldn't have time to get a gas mask if you came under enemy gas attack, so having a beard wouldn't be an issue.  In reality, it's a regulation that was introduced during WWI for hygiene and was kept for uniformity and discipline reasons more so than gas mask seals. It's basically the same reason that your hair has to be a certain length, yet females can wear their hair longer than males. If it was a safety issue, everyone would need the same length of hair."
fuckingmanly,2q1pti,captmonkey,1 point,Mon Dec 22 18:00:52 2014 UTC,"As for hair, it should be a safety issue. If someone is trying to kill you, they're definitely going to do everything they can, including grabbing hair."
fuckingmanly,2q1pti,jacobthehunter,3,Mon Dec 22 18:05:05 2014 UTC,"It's not necessarily a safety issue. It was/is not uncommon for special forces to have relaxed grooming standards.   I served in the Navy, where having mustaches was okay, but beards were not. Even though gas attack and mask fit was the most commonly quoted reason for not allowing beards, it is still allowed in some circumstances. This is a good read. Many other countries allow them, at this point it seems a bit silly we are sticking with it, when the military has a pretty long history of allowing them.  EDIT: I realized you may have meant the length of the hair, not necessarily just a beard. The reason given for that is usually less combat related, and more regulation related. Still, relaxed grooming has applied to that as well for certain teams."

fuckingmanly,2q1pti,autowikibot,2,Mon Dec 22 18:31:25 2014 UTC,"But again, it's the US military in 2014. There's not a lot of instances where people are getting into hand-to-hand wrestling matches with enemy soldiers where hair-pulling would be a weakness. Most of the people in the military have jobs far away from the fighting, anyway. ISIS probably isn't going to be pulling the hair of someone stationed in Kansas working a desk job.  That being said, if you travel through time and you're planning on lining up and running across the field to get into hand-to-hand combat with a horde of angry vikings, then yes, in that case, you should cut your hair and shave."
fuckingmanly,2q1pti,captmonkey,1 point,Mon Dec 22 18:17:25 2014 UTC,That makes sense. I was thinking of stories I've been told about someone going through a narrow hallway and a guy jumped out and attacked the guy (2003) but that's probably not very common anymore.
fuckingmanly,2q1pti,jacobthehunter,2,Mon Dec 22 18:51:22 2014 UTC,"I'd say that's not a real common experience for anyone in the US military. If you're infantry or have some other combat job like that, then regs on hair and beard make sense. However, the majority of people are, like I said, non-combat troops. They do things like load bombs, work on computers, fix engines on various vehicles, etc. As far as safety goes, the hair on their head and faces matters about as much as it does for someone in the civilian world. They'll never even see an enemy, let alone be within arms length of them where they could grab hair."
fuckingmanly,2q1pti,captmonkey,2,Mon Dec 22 18:59:08 2014 UTC,It's the military. Hair should be short. It makes us look uniform and professional.
fuckingmanly,2q1pti,HeartAndFist_,1 point,Mon Dec 22 20:57:16 2014 UTC,"Like I said, that's the real reason, not the commonly stated gas mask seal reason. I wasn't arguing either way, I was just saying that the usually cited reasons of safety (in regards to gas masks and hair pulling) don't make sense in a modern context and the only real reason is for uniformity and discipline.  And while uniform look is certainly true, I would say the looking ""professional"" or like part of the military is entirely a present-day American construct and quite debatable. One need only look to the American Civil War to see a whole host of American soldiers with longer hair and an array of various styles of facial hair. Likewise, there were plenty of American soldiers with facial hair well outside of modern-day regulations in the Spanish American War."
fuckingmanly,2q1pti,captmonkey,1 point,Mon Dec 22 21:17:35 2014 UTC,"Soldiers still need to clear hallways and risk coming into close vicinity of enemy combatants. Is a hand-to-hand brawl likely? No. Is it still possible? Absolutely. The military isn't about what reddit thinks looks stylish and manly - it's about being tactical. And a beard is only tactical if it helps you blend in. In any sort of close combat situation NO hair (including super manly facial hair) is the most tactical option. A man growing out his hair like a mountain man is certainly fuckingmanly. But it's not tactical, and the military need not change any regs. Wanna' have a nice beard and a mountain man lion's mane? Don't join the military."
fuckingmanly,2q1pti,AceGeister,1 point,Mon Dec 22 22:26:32 2014 UTC,"Right, infantry needs to do that, like I said, and that makes perfect sense for people in the infantry and other combat jobs. Also, like I've already said, most people in the military aren't in the infantry, they're working desk jobs and other positions where they're about as likely to encounter an enemy combatant as a civilian.   ""Being tactical"" doesn't matter to the guy stationed in Kansas who spends his days running network cables. It doesn't matter to the guy at the radio outpost in the middle of the Australian outback. It doesn't matter to the guy on the bottom of the ocean in a submarine. There are specific requirements for certain jobs, like good eyesight for pilots. This doesn't mean that good eyesight should be a requirement for all jobs in the military.   After looking it up, 15% of the US Army are combat arms (includes infantry, cavalry, etc.). I would guess the Marines might be around that or slightly higher and much lower for the Air Force and Navy. That's a lot of people who have almost no chance of encountering enemy troops, let alone being a situation where they can grab hair.  As I've said in other replies, I'm not arguing either way, I'm just stating that the claim that short hair and no beard is for safety of the troops is quite a bit of stretch since it doesn't matter to the vast majority of those in the military. And as I've also said (I feel like I'm repeating myself over and over, here), it makes sense from a discipline and uniformity standpoint, which is the real reason... like I said in my initial reply. It's the safety claim that I find hard to swallow."

The words Makua Hanai in Eddie Aikau's full name means feeding parent,  an adoptive, nurturing, fostering parent,   in the Hawaiian language. As the first lifeguard at Waimea Bay on the island of Oahu, he saved over 500 people and became famous for surfing the big Hawaiian surf, winning several awards including the 1977 Duke Kahanamoku Invitational Surfing Championship.

fuckingmanly,2ph4vj,rossbw,7,Tue Dec 16 15:36:09 2014 UTC,It's probably faded from wear...
fuckingmanly,2ph4vj,GrimWillis,5,Tue Dec 16 17:15:04 2014 UTC,That doesn't happen anymore.
fuckingmanly,2ph4vj,swanee89,1 point,Tue Dec 16 18:24:23 2014 UTC,You can force it though. Add half a cap full of bleach to the wash and it'll make it look faded. Had a few of the more inventive/moronic junior guys I used to be stationed with do this to their uniforms and it worked somewhat well. The big problem is that it makes for a uniformed fading which isn't how that works. I'd also assume that this could probably damage the clothes a bit but I wouldn't know for sure because I was never dumb enough to try and make my uniforms look saltier than I was.

fuckingmanly,2p5ljd,laxbra,12,Sat Dec 13 06:50:19 2014 UTC,I think an hour of him talking while doing wood-working would have been more interesting.
fuckingmanly,2p5ljd,zzubnik,9,Sat Dec 13 17:22:40 2014 UTC,"I love Nick Offer man in pretty much everything he does. This special, evaluated as a comedy special, is a train wreck.  It comes across as rambling punctuated by the occasional shock joke, with the occasional awkward very deep geek in joke attempt. He breaks his tough Ron voice with his ""drunk Ron"" giggle at all kinds of wrong places.  There has to be some kind of technical explanation. Like, I was in choir one time and we got terrible scores at a contest after an absolutely flawless performance. Then we listened to the recording and checked pitch and realized we slid down several notes - it was terrible, but somehow it just wasn't on the list of what we had checked in practice - a stupid, completely embarrassing and shaming oversight that we had no excuse for. This is the comedy equivalent. There's some kind of fundamental, basic oversight that occurred here."
fuckingmanly,2p5ljd,shackwait,21,Sun Dec 14 04:24:56 2014 UTC,"I didn't really find it that funny. It felt very much like a continuation of his ron Swanson character. And I get it and the absurdity of Ron is funny but these are supposed to be some new ideas that he's sharing with us. And they're not new. Compare this with Bill Burrs new special also on Netflix. Its original, it doesn't have tangentially related shots edited in, and it feels very natural and flowy like a conversation. Am I alone in thinking this? I feel Ron Swanson is parroted so much around here that we forget he's a very one dimensional idea, not a human being."
fuckingmanly,2p5ljd,StolenJewelry,19,Sat Dec 13 10:53:42 2014 UTC,"I think when you strip away politics from the character, Ron Swanson isn't all that different from the persona that Nick Offerman seems to have otherwise.  Pretty much everything from the special came from his book and most of his ""lessons"" didn't seem especially cartoonish as though one could only imagine the words coming from Ron Swanson's mouth."
fuckingmanly,2p5ljd,brain739,10,Sat Dec 13 13:12:46 2014 UTC,"Okay so you are comparing a seasoned stand-up vet who has toured tons and over many years built his routine up to what it is now.  Whereas nick offerman is an actor who is using his current success to launch a few live comedy tours.  Make some extra change. Try to build his name a little more.  Realistically Offerman, who i love, is a comedic stuntman that got a chance at stardom with a unique charcter.  Bill burr is a professional stand up comedian."

fuckingmanly,2p5ljd,StolenJewelry,1 point,Sat Dec 13 19:40:05 2014 UTC,"I think you missed the entire point of his statement.  You can't expect a rookie to put the same numbers as a seasoned pro in any sport, why do you have such high expectations for a stand up comedy?  why can't you just take it for what it's worth?  or are your standards really that high?  in that case you probably shouldn't watch most stuff on netfilx"

He is best known for Menuet za kitaro (A Minuet for Guitar; 1975) describing the years he spent in Slovene Partisans. In Titoist Yugoslavia he was sentenced to 18 years in a show trial, and upon his release in 1955 his works could only be published under a pseudonym Langus.

You'll surprise yourself. Never have sex with anyone that doesn't want it as much as you. Never hit anyone unless they are an immediate threat. Every hat should serve a purpose. Never take her to the movies on the first date. Learn to wet shave. Nothing looks more badass than a well-tailored suit. Shave with the grain on the first go-around. Always look a person in the eye when you talk to them. Buy a plunger before you need a plunger. Exercise makes you happy. Run, lift, and play sports. Brush your teeth before you put on your tie. A small amount of your paycheck should go directly to your savings account every month. Call your parents every week. Never wear a clip-on tie. Give a firm handshake. Compliment her shoes. Never leave a pint unfinished. If you aren't confident, fake it. It will come. You can tell the size of a man by the size of things that bother him. Be conscious of your body language. The only reason to ever point a gun at someone is if you intend to shoot them. Always stand to shake someone's hand. Never lend anything you can't afford to lose. Ask more than you answer. Everybody likes to talk about themselves. Keep a change of clothes at the office. Buy high quality tools, so you only have to buy them once. Manliness is not only being able to take care of yourself, but others as well. Go with the decision that will make for a good story. When you walk, look straight ahead, not at your feet. Nice guys don't finish last. Boring guys do. Find your passion and figure out how to get paid for it. Don't let the little head do the thinking for the big head. No matter their job or status in life, everyone deserves your respect. The most important thing you can learn is personal responsibility. Bad things happen, it's your job to overcome them. The first one to get angry loses. Do what needs to be done without complaining. It won't help speed things up. Never stop learning. Always go out into public dressed like you're about to meet the love of your life. Don't change yourself just to make someone happy, unless that someone is you. If you're the smartest person in the room, you're in the wrong room. Luck favors the prepared. Women find confidence sexy as hell. Do whatever you want to do in the life, but be the best at it. No one is on their deathbed wishing they spent more time at work. Enjoy your life."

A movie on a first date isn't a bad idea. First off, it's a great sign if she's just as excited to go see Star Wars as you are. And communication is only 10% verbal, so a trip to the movies is a good way to become comfortable with being physically close to the other person. Discussing the movie afterwards can be a good ice breaker too.   I think people's issue is thinking the date ends when the movie ends. If you follow it with dinner and drinks you'll be spending hours getting to know the other person anyway. Going to the movies just helps to get that initial awkwardness out of the way so you can enjoy the rest of your evening together."

You learn to be a man from hanging out with men--maybe the OP's just not doing enough of that.  OP: see if there's a local nonprofit youth boxing club in your area, the kind associated with Golden Gloves or Junior Olympics or whatever; that gets street kids some quality time with strong male mentors. If you're old enough, volunteer, start working out, and start putting in some ring time with one of the coaches. If you're not old enough to volunteer, join and start working out and boxing and observing the coaches closely to see how they carry themselves in life.

But sometimes you just gotta reach out and punch that motherfucker right upside the head. Whether you punch a motherfucker upside the head is really neither here nor there, but what the operative concept is taking action. Don't ever make idle threats, do what you say you'll do.

Manliness is not a materialist cargo cult.  It's a state of mind.  The DE is good if the DE is practical.  The DE is not good because buying it makes you feel as though you have found a way to buy your way into masculinity."

I know I get a better shave from my regular cartridge razor, but I shave with my DE still on Sunday nights because the shave is good enough and I find the whole process meditative (i.e. preparing the lather, using the razor, cleaning the razor afterwards, etc.)  Consumerism has taught us that to be stuff you need to buy stuff, which is sad."
fuckingmanly,2n32wt,Tellevision,2,Sun Nov 23 00:58:56 2014 UTC,I'm assuming that you just don't know how to shave. Don't feel bad : I didn't really learn until I was about 35.

fuckingmanly,2n32wt,theathenian11,1 point,Sat Nov 22 17:57:15 2014 UTC,As someone who just made the switch to a DE razor from a mach 3 I get just as close of a shave with the grain.  However with the DE I can actually manage to shave across the grain and against the grain without bleeding.  The only reason I would ever go back is... I can't think of a reason actually.

It kinda worked but it was a bit of a pain to keep the blade at the right orientation. The head had a built in wobble feature to fit the curves of the face or something. The real handle had been designed to balance it out more accurately of course, I hadn't noticed it before. I ended up just holding it directly with my fingers and that worked fine."

fuckingmanly,2mqtpz,theoxfordtailor,4,Wed Nov 19 13:04:56 2014 UTC,"I've actually seen it. Riff-trax had a go at it a while back. The answer to your question is that they definitely wrote the script then tried to find a tame buffalo. I emphasize the word try because if you watch the movie, it's clear that this buffalo is in no way trained. The whole movie, it's obvious that buffalo wants nothing to do with him. The movie is terrible, but almost worth watching just because of the crazy shots they get. The dude legitimately fights a mountain lion. I hope that guy got paid a lot, because he was clearly in a ton of danger the entire length of the film."

To many of us are raising pansies that can not do basic plumbing or construction.   A place where we discuss overcoming a culture where everyone gets a ribbon and fixing your own furnace is frowned upon.  At age 10 I taught my son to whittle, this resulted in a mandatory meeting with his school counselor to discuss the dangers of weapons.  I think I have done a pretty good job, however I have my areas that need improvement. Searching for advice online I found no useful resources  where I could get advice from other men on the same quest.   Creating a successful Sub can be challenging, so if you have any ideas on how to make the sub a better and more useful resource please dont hesitate to shout out advice.   No subject will be off limits, seriously I think a discussion about what age we should teach our sons to use an Axe is important."

(I'm assuming I'll get downvotes like crazy, but figured I'd share my family's story even though official historical records don't show him ever having any kids...but it's kind of hard to believe a guy who was into prostitutes in an era before condoms were common didn't get anyone pregnant.)  The short of it is Wyatt Earp was really into prostitutes and while working at a brothel he knocked one up and left town.  It's possible he wasn't the father and she just said he was since he'd left and it's easy to blame someone who isn't there. Plus there's that whole 19th century taboo of having kids out of wedlock.  http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2372863/Wyatt-Earp-prostitute-loving-man-hero-vigilante-portrayed-movies-new-book-claims.html  One of those prostitutes was allegedly my great-great-great grandma - which isn't surprising since I come from a pretty long line of drunks and criminals.  I would say I'm in the first generation of his alleged illegitimate offspring to stay out of trouble, but two of my brothers already ruined that one.  Interesting side note - My family is really into shooting competitions and we do pretty well. Earp was also known for having a huge sweet-tooth (ice cream in particular) and all of us are big into candy/junk food/anything with sugar.  I'd love to get a DNA test done to find out if any of this is true, but I'm not even sure if that's possible."

fuckingmanly,2lhzda,jc1593,4,Thu Nov 6 19:28:17 2014 UTC,"First of all ""less than lethal"" not non lethal.  second officers are citizens with badges, no citizen can perform a citizens arrest on someone with the basis of 'I dont want to tell you'   fighting with the police is irrelevant, the man is defending himself from two aggressors. He was in the right.   Police tend to arrest more and more people on the basis of 'resisting arrest' and more and more of these cases are being throw out of court because there is no reason for the arrest in the first place.   Non of us saw the beginning but it most likely wasnt always a 'high stress' situation and if they could have told him what the warrant was for it would not have escalated.   I agree that it was not excessive force for an arrest, but this was not an arrest this was illegal aggression. police must identify themselves and the charges against you or it is the equivalent of kidnapping."
fuckingmanly,2lhzda,mildlybreezy,1 point,Thu Nov 6 23:32:48 2014 UTC,"People forget that the constitution trumps all laws. The right to travel freely means in order for anyone (even police) to prevent you from traveling freely they must show a warrant. Without one the man is well within his rights to not even speak to the officers let alone submit to unlawful arrest.   a law enforcement officer (who is in fact separate from an ordinary citizen)   People mention that officers are separate from citizens a lot, could you cite something stating that? I have never been able to find anything of the sort.   If this was going on at the mans house they would have had to show a warrant to enter, (no knock searches are unconstitutional regardless of the law) so why do they not have to show one to him anywhere else? Is his person not private property protected by the constitution as well?    If you want to be a citizen in modern society and enjoy all of the benefits thereof, you forfeit the right to pick and chose which laws you will obey.   The same goes for laws, if laws want to be upheld in the courts of a constitutional country then they cannot choose which rights they obey.    driving a motorized vehicle is a privilege   This is interesting because there is actually a small (movement?) starting in America which people do not have plates or licenses on their vehicles. They get tickets/fines and fight them on the basis of freedom to travel. It is fascinating you should check it out.    Submitting to a lawful arrest is one of them   If I was in the man's position the conversation would be ""I don't answer questions. Am I being detained?"" If yes ""Under what pretense?"" If warrant showed or crime stated. ""I do not consent to searches, or answer questions"" and then go with them silently until a lawyer is called.   I personally believe they were both in the wrong, police and man but no one here saw the full incident.   BTW this is amazing an actual debate between ideas not an argument between people"

Origins of article  Airbag:       The airbag specified for automobile use traces its origins to air-filled bladders as early as 1941.   The invention is also credited independently to the German engineer Walter Linderer, and to the North American John W. Hetrick who in 1951 registered for the first of his airbag patents.  Linderer filed German patent #896,312 on October 6, 1951, which was issued on November 12, 1953, approximately three months after American John Hetrick was issued US patent #2,649,311 on August 18, 1953.  Linderer's airbag was based on a compressed air system, either released by bumper contact or by the driver. Later research during the 1960s showed that compressed air could not inflate Linderer's airbag fast enough for maximum safety, thus making it an impractical system.    Hetrick was an industrial engineer and member of the United States Navy. His airbag was designed based on his experiences with compressed air from torpedoes during his service in the Navy, combined with a desire to provide protection for his family in their automobile during accidents. Hetrick worked with the major American automobile corporations at the time, but they chose not to invest in it.   Although airbags are now required in every automobile sold in the US, Hetrick's 1951 patent filing serves as an example of a ""valuable"" invention with little economic value to its inventor because its first commercial use did not occur until after the patent expired when in 1971, it was installed as an experiment in a few Ford cars.

And it looks like you grabbed one of your wife's decorative wall plates for your dinner.  I can only assume your men's plates are dirty and you didn't want to make that scotch wait any longer for you while you had your wife do the dishes.  21 years is long enough.
fuckingmanly,2ketaf,Boating_Enthusiast,3,Sun Oct 26 23:30:38 2014 UTC,"I can't say I have ever paid much attention to the plates.  They are just items to hold food on.  I actually did run the steak across some hot coals before but not enough to change the color on the inside.  Wife is out of town though, that's why I didn't need to worry about cooking any sides."
fuckingmanly,2ketaf,Boating_Enthusiast,2,Sun Oct 26 23:42:38 2014 UTC,"That steak looks amazing.  I was going to grill salmon tonight, but I might have to stop by the store for steak.  fish can be a side for steak, right?  I've found that brushing melted butter on my steaks on the grill gives them a great smokey flavor from the dripping (and burning) butter.  Works great if you only have a gas grill."

fuckingmanly,2ketaf,Allymooo,2,Mon Oct 27 04:36:13 2014 UTC,I usually offset grill my steak till it is about 105-110 inside (thermometers are the ultimate grilling weapon) then I take them off and brush both sides with oil (butter has a much lower smoke point than vegetable or canola oil).  Then I put the steak directly above the hottest coals for about 45-60 seconds a side.  Then I let it rest just a bit.  I have a gas grill and a Weber kettle many times I will do the initial heating on the gas grill and the finish on the weber. the 70$ or so for a Weber kettle is about the best money you can spend for making meat hot and good.

You don't have to raise it either. You can appreciate the farmer who fed and cared for the cow so it'd produce tender, marbled steak. After a hard days work, it's time to man the grill, and add the finishing touches to a meal that was long in the making. So raise your glass to those who, like you, understand the value of working for quality, and enjoy the fruits, or steaks, of your labor. (This is also why a 21 year old single malt scotch is fucking manly. All that hard work, attention to detail, and dedication to produce a few small glasses of whisky. But the end result is beautiful to every sense. The warm amber tone, the sound of scotch being poured into a glass, the smokey, woody scents, the flavor of oak and campfire, all mixed into the warmth of each sip.)"

fuckingmanly,2k9yib,airplaneshooter,1 point,Sun Oct 26 02:47:02 2014 UTC,"Semi-automatic pistol:       A semi-automatic pistol is a type of handgun which utilizes the energy of the fired cartridge to cycle the action of the gun and advance the next available cartridge into position for firing. One round is fired each time the trigger of a semi-automatic pistol is pulled.  Additional terms sometimes used as synonyms for a semi-automatic pistol are automatic pistol, self-loading pistol, autopistol, and autoloading pistol.  A semi-automatic pistol harnesses the energy of one shot to reload the chamber for the next. After a round is fired, the spent casing is ejected and a new round from the magazine is loaded into the chamber, allowing another shot to be fired as soon as the trigger is pulled again. Most pistols use recoil operation to do this but some pistols use blowback or gas operation.

It began with the Soviet invasion of Finland on 30 November 1939 (three months after the outbreak of World War II),  and ended with the Moscow Peace Treaty on 13 March 1940.""  So it seems the Winter War was a war that took place during the official time interval of WW2. I would assume this means Winter War is a WW2 battle, as would be the Battle of Stalingrad, the Dieppe Raid, Operation Overlord, etc."
fuckingmanly,2j99m2,Darumana,1 point,Wed Oct 15 14:56:02 2014 UTC,"No, it is not true. For Soviet Union, World War 2 started with the beginning of Operation Barbarossa in 1941. But you might call it a matter of ... opinion. However... if the Winter War is part of World War 2, is the second Sino-Japanese War also part of World War 2? Or can we consider the whole WW2 as part of World War 1? The truth is that the events in Finland had no real relationship to the Axis powers so ... it is not really the same in my opinion."
fuckingmanly,2j99m2,daytona955i,0,Wed Oct 15 19:38:36 2014 UTC,"Ah, so what you're saying is that the Winter War was a conflict between Finland and USSR.... but with no relation or connection to Nazi Germany. Correct? If so then I understand what you're saying."
fuckingmanly,2j99m2,Boating_Enthusiast,1 point,Wed Oct 15 20:10:34 2014 UTC,"No relationship to any of the Axis powers. The belligerents in WW2 were the Allies on one side and the Axis on the other side. Various other people sided with each of the power at different times for various reasons. But the actual Winter War was not sparked by the treaty of Versailles at the end of WW1. And it had nothing to do with the rest of the Allies or the rest of the Axis powers. Only the Soviet Union (which was not in the war at that point) and Finland (which had no relationship to any Axis power). So if you are going to include that period in the war, then you also need to include the Sino-Japanese war too (because the Japanese also clashed with the Russians during that war). And if we include THAT period into the war, well... when do we stop? In my view, WW2 is a war that is between the Axis and the Allies. Finland is neither at that point in time. Neither is Soviet Union. (The Molotov-Ribbentrop pact was still in vigor)."

The worse physical repercussion he'll suffer is the wind being knocked out of him.   Good job coach."

fuckingmanly,2hb7dg,wafflesareforever,2,Wed Sep 24 11:26:38 2014 UTC,"You don't have to walk around with it on you at all times. Just keep it somewhere you can access it when needed. Typically, one might keep it in their bedroom (ideally in a fast-open safe). You're afraid someone might have broken into your home, corral your family one one room, call the police, and be ready to shoot in case the bad guy enters the room.   More tactically minded people could stash guns in different locations throughout their home so they can be ready. It might be as simple as shoving a gun in a drawer. It might be as complex as a series of hidden cabinets and wall safes."
fuckingmanly,2hb7dg,HeresCyonnah,1 point,Wed Sep 24 12:50:50 2014 UTC,... my pistol is on my hip almost 24/7 and my shotgun is hanging on my bedroom wall and is ready to go at a moments notice.
fuckingmanly,2hb7dg,wafflesareforever,1 point,Wed Sep 24 12:27:22 2014 UTC,"Well, that's cool and all, but are you typical and are you responsible? I'm willing to concede the second point.   My issue is that the typical ""home defense"" proponent doesn't have their weapon with them 24/7. If you do then I commend you. I would also argue that you are either paranoid or may want to consider moving. I believe strongly in the second amendment, but I find most arguments for the use of deadly force flawed and I find most ""home defense"" proponents that I've spoken with/read to conflate gun ownership with safety. I don't know you and we haven't spoken, but I'm willing to listen to/read your stance. Keep in mind, I'm not attacking you or your beliefs, but I really don't know many people who could fight off a home-invader with a firearm and fewer still who are positioned to do so."
fuckingmanly,2hb7dg,lostwithoutyou87,3,Thu Sep 25 02:04:53 2014 UTC,"Am I typical? I'd like to think that I am. most of my friends and people that I hang out with have some sort of firearm on them at some time. then again, I am getting into Law Enforcement so I may have a group of friends which are slightly different than the rest of society.  Am I paranoid? no. I do not fear home invasion (very, very low crime area, I live in the country) I carry a firearm because A) theyre fucking cool and I like to be around them B) I live in the country so there is nothing holding me back C) so that if (god forbid) somebody invaded my home I could quickly react.  what do you find flawed about the arguments for deadly force? if somebody invades my home, and has the means, motivation and opportunity to harm me, my girlfriend or my pets, I will use deadly force to neutralize the threat. not because I want to kill somebody (far from) but because I couldnt bear myself if my family was hurt because of my inaction.   Could I fight off a home invader? yes. I have been around guns since I was four, I have been to tactical/defensive pistol/shotgun/carbine/extreme long range classes, I constantly train with all my defensive guns. this is 112 rounds of 9mm out of my pistol at 15 yards standing with the chest being slow and the head being very fast.  I'm glad that you're willing to have a rational discussion about using a firearm for self defense. I know that many are simply not willing to do so. I'd love to have a discussion with you about this which is respectful about each others beliefs. just let me know if I ever step over a line."
fuckingmanly,2hb7dg,wow_such_dog,0,Wed Sep 24 17:54:45 2014 UTC,"I suppose that the easiest way to explain my questions regarding people who do carry within their home is to reiterate: why? ""Because they're fucking cool"" doesn't really address the why of it, in my opinion.   I get your other answers, to a point. If you're living in fear that someone will enter your home forcefully, intending to do harm to you or your family, then I'm glad you're prepared, but as a reason to do something, ""because I can and because it's cool,"" to paraphrase, seems lacking. You can drive a car through your home and it would be pretty cool, but that's not a significant reason to do it. All this aside, I'm not trying to convince you not to carry a handgun 24/7. Hell, shower with one. I'm just skeptical of your reasons and I sincerely doubt that most gun owners would be able to draw down on an intruder effectively or in a timely fashion. All of which goes back to my original comment."
fuckingmanly,2hb7dg,jkc3ny,1 point,Wed Sep 24 18:18:10 2014 UTC,"I hope that my interjection into this conversation is not unwelcome; with that being said I would like to make a point or two. I can't give a reason as to why someone would carry a gun on them throughout the home on a consistent basis, other than they simply like to do so. But I would argue, as I believe another commenter said, that a gun in an easily and quickly accessible place is as valid as carrying a gun with you at all times for defense.  If there is a question of why have a gun to defend the home, I find it helpful to draw a parallel to a fire extinguisher. There is never a plan for a fire, but the reality is that they occur. And you can call the fire department, but it is also good to have an extinguisher to reduce the threat of fire spreading as much as possible.   As to the use of deadly force, at least in my state, if there is an intruder in the home, at night I believe, then it is assumed under the law that there is malicious intent on the part of the intruder. I certainly assume that. Given the presence of a wife and child, there is no room for speculation in the event they are there to harm me. My roommate argues that the only reason for deadly force is the want to kill another person, with which I obviously do not agree.  Again I apologize if my interjection is unwelcome."
fuckingmanly,2hb7dg,wow_such_dog,1 point,Wed Sep 24 18:41:42 2014 UTC,I don't know anyone in their right mind who walks around their home with a gun but I do have a few stashed around my house for home intruder situations.
fuckingmanly,2hb7dg,atropinebase,3,Thu Sep 25 00:43:49 2014 UTC,"Exactly. That's why I don't own a gun - I wouldn't feel safe unless it was extremely well-secured against my two curious sons who will get their hands on it otherwise, but that level of security means that it would be useless against, say, an intruder with a machete. I keep a baseball bat under my bed, and I'm six-four, 200. That won't help me against a guy with a gun, but I like my odds in most other situations."

fuckingmanly,2fz5s1,wheysted,2,Thu Sep 11 03:22:38 2014 UTC,I'm Scottish and I've been to a couple of highland games. It's not like sports when there's teams and such. It's like an open even at the games where anyone can come up and try to toss the caber and see who wins. If you really want to win you can just go to a wood supply store and ask for one and they'll make you one to practice at home. Since a caber is just a log they aren't really a specialty item. You could just cut down a tree and use that if you want.
fuckingmanly,2fz5s1,TheSmex,3,Sat Sep 13 10:05:09 2014 UTC,You could just cut down a tree and use that if you want.   Like a fucking man.
fuckingmanly,2fz5s1,OhSweetZombieJesus,2,Sun Sep 14 14:46:19 2014 UTC,"From Wikipedia:   The caber toss is a traditional Scottish athletic event in which competitors toss a large tapered pole called a ""caber"". It is normally practiced at the Scottish Highland Games. In Scotland the caber is usually made from a Larch tree and is typically 19 feet 6 inches (5.94 m) tall and weighs 175 pounds (79 kg). The term 'caber' derives from the Gaelic word ""cabar"" or ""kaber"" which refers to a wooden beam.  The person tossing the caber is called a ""tosser"" or a ""thrower.""  It is said to have developed from the need to toss logs across narrow chasms (in order to cross them) or by lumberjacks challenging each other to a small contest.  The primary objective is to toss the caber so that it turns end over end, falling away from the tosser. Ideally it should fall directly away from the tosser in the ""12 o'clock"" position. The distance thrown is unimportant."

fuckingmanly,2frtek,kewee_,3,Mon Sep 8 02:23:03 2014 UTC,"Some time ago, I posted this thread on /r/fuckingmanly about the familly handmade wooden boat.  Well, said boat went unused for the last 4 years and was kept in storage for multiple reasons. The old man (the one that built that thing of beauty) was getting older and could not man the Catamaran alone anymore. His main teamate (that would be me) moved for college during the last 4 years and was way to far away to sail. Other potential sailors were unsure if they wanted to ride her because, let's say it frankly, she's a wild horse and will scare the living shit out of anyone who doesn't know how to handle her reins.  Fast forward 4 years, I graduate, get a job in my hometown during the winter and now have quite a bit of free time. I convince the old man to sail again, we fix what need to be fixed on the boat (e.g. new, stronger fiberglass rudders), makes plans and pulled the trigger today. Shit happens on the road, we explode the rear bumper because the trailer hitch coupler was baddly pinned, yada yada yada. We finally arrive at our destination, tie everything, double check every cotter pins, launch and board the boat and sail away.  The second we start to gain speed, something unusual happens... The freaking rudders are vibrating and start singing with different pitch! We get tugged by the waves, we get blown by the wind, we get splashed by the hull hitting the water and we can't stop smiling and swearing at the best roller-coaster made by mankind.  4 hours passed, we are chilled, wet, exhausted, but with pounding hearts filled with joy.  Yup, today was a good, fucking manly, day."

fuckingmanly,2fj345,thename226,2,Sat Sep 6 03:34:40 2014 UTC,"Choking on your puke is a real risk, but the medical term is acute alcohol poisoning... and there can be a few things that'll kill you.   Essentially there is so much alcohol in your blood that your blood and other organs stop being able to perform their normal function. So it might be that your liver or kidneys just stop working, or (more likely) that you enter respiratory distress because your lungs can't oxygenate your blood enough so you start hyperventilating. Brain damage can be caused by both the alcohol and by the lack of oxygen (if severe enough, this can also kill you).   Is it a painful way to go? Well, if you're conscious for it it'll be pretty fucking unpleasant, and you're far more likely to just do your body and/or brain serious damage which you then have to live with than actually kill yourself."

I get more work with less complaining, higher moral, and better results from my guys by leading through mutual respect.  I'm not a leader because I was in the right spot at the right time and I'm not a leader because I find ways of scaring my people into doing their jobs.  I'm a leader because my superiors AND subordinates want me in that position.  They trust me to do the right thing and to keep them safe.

Have you seen the video where he breaks a string and switches guitars with his tech in the middle of playing without making a mistake? It is awe-inspiring. I fear that true artistry like this has gone unappreciated lately. Closest popular guitarist these days is John Mayer, but he seems to be more well-known for his folksy stuff now than the amazing blues guitarist he really is."
fuckingmanly,2eexc6,meaty87,2,Sun Aug 24 03:05:18 2014 UTC,I have seen that video and SRV is an inspiration to watch. His mastery and passion for his music and his wife are things to aspire to. If John Mayer would actually be a man in his interviews and not a cocky boy and played less pop I would respect him more. But he is a phenomenal blues guitarist.
fuckingmanly,2eexc6,meaty87,2,Sun Aug 24 03:36:14 2014 UTC,Completely agree. He's been way too influenced by the execs and has let his true talent take a backseat to the fangirls. But the John Mayer of 6-10 years ago was an amazing blues guitarist.

fuckingmanly,2e3ei0,autowikibot,5,Wed Aug 20 18:21:08 2014 UTC,"Surströmming:       Surströmming (pronounced [sʉ̌ːrstrœmːɪŋ], Swedish for ""soured herring""), is fermented Baltic sea herring and is a staple of traditional northern Swedish cuisine since at least the 16th century. Just enough salt is used to prevent the raw fish from rotting (chemical decomposition). A fermentation process (which converts sugar to acids, gases, and alcohol) of at least six months gives the lightly-salted fish its characteristic strong smell and somewhat acidulous taste.  When opened, the contents release a strong and sometimes overwhelming odour; the dish is ordinarily eaten outdoors. According to a Japanese study, a newly opened can of surströmming has one of the most putrid food smells in the world, even more so than similarly fermented fish dishes such as the Korean Hongeohoe or Japanese Kusaya.   The Baltic herring, known as strömming in Swedish, is smaller than the Atlantic herring, found in the North Sea, and traditionally the definition of strömming (Baltic herring) is herring fished in the brackish waters of the Baltic north of the Kalmar Strait  The herring used for surströmming are caught just prior to spawning.

If a seal lets go and allows oil to leak into the cylinders, you can't shut off the ""fuel"" supply to the engine, and it will continue running until you cut off the air supply, or it runs out of crankcase oil.   The safest way to stop a runaway is to direct a CO2 fire extinguisher at the intake. Next best way is to block the air intake."

The initial purchase is a bit pricey, but the cost per round is really low.  My friend bought a thousand rounds of 7.62x51 for $400.  You just have to check regularly to see when they have sales on ammunition."

fuckingmanly,2dqvok,10tothe24th,-31,Sun Aug 17 03:09:56 2014 UTC,"It's correct in that it's the term used by the community, granted, but they were not designed to be used for sport. That's what I take issue with.  I'm not against people owning them, but saying they're for ""sport"" insults people's intelligence."
fuckingmanly,2dqvok,Wyo-Patriot,18,Sun Aug 17 04:37:12 2014 UTC,"They are used for sport. And self defense. And many other things. But with a tens of millions of them in the hands of Americans today, they are primarily being used for sport."

This is not one of them.  Again, I'm not against owning them, but let's call a spade a spade. You can hunt with a Scottish claymore if you're so inclined, but that doesn't make it a ""sporting sword""."
fuckingmanly,2dqvok,Wyo-Patriot,15,Sun Aug 17 04:42:51 2014 UTC,"But what were they designed for?   Whatever the owner wants it to be.

Again, I'm not against owning them   Then why do you insist on them being called a name that was manipulated by the media to invoke fear and hatred for this inanimate object?   And they DO NOT meet the literal definition of an Assault Rifle, so I won't call them one. Calling a spade a spade, huh?"
fuckingmanly,2dqvok,10tothe24th,-23,Sun Aug 17 04:48:45 2014 UTC,"Whatever the owner wants it to be.   That's not how it works. They were designed to be used by soldiers. The fact that it's (presumably) been modified to be semi-automatic doesn't change that fact. There are plenty of semi-auto, fully-auto, and even bolt-action weapons designed specifically for soldiers to use in battle that civilians can also buy.   That's what is so great about the customization ability of the AR platform.   He's also holding an AK-47.   Then why do you insist on them being called a name that was manipulated by the media to invoke fear and hatred for this inanimate object?   What name did I insist on calling them? I insisted that they weren't designed for sport. That's all.  Your reactionism is showing, patriot.   And they DO NOT meet the literal definition of an Assault Rifle, so I won't call them one. Calling a spade a spade, huh?   Your butthurt over CNN is blinding you. See, I'm a stickler. You may be absolutely correct that the media (goddamn Hollyweird libruls, amirite?) is using the ""assault rifle"" word to make people afraid of them, and that's bullshit. That's absolute fucking bullshity of them. Those fucking commie twats. But see, that doesn't make it right to call a fucking weapon of war--modified though it is--a ""sporting rifle"".  Again, technically, that might be what the firearms community calls it, but then they're just as guilty as the stinking socialist Obama-loving aborto-fascist media is of using a bullshit term to try and mislead people.  Complaining about their bullshit while defending the blatant bullshit of your own term is utter hypocrisy. An honest term would be more like ""Civilian AR"" or ""Modified AR"" or something along those lines. Maybe you're uncomfortable with the ""assault rifle"" term, so maybe another term needs to be used (automatic rifle, maybe?), but the point is, ""sporting"" they are not.  I know a lot of hunters. I grew up around hunters. They don't use those weapons for hunting. Sure, you can, but again, you can hunt with just about anything (including actual assault rifles, which makes them sporting rifles too, I suppose).  So yes, let's call a spade a spade. It wasn't designed for sport. Everyone knows it, left, right, and center. ""AR"" may be an incorrect term, but it's far more accurate than ""sporting""."

fuckingmanly,2cylij,Fuckledore,8,Sun Aug 10 01:14:00 2014 UTC,"True, but you dislike it because you don't like the specific flavor. It's not like you're writing off fruity drinks because you perceive them as girly; that's what I'm referring to.  In terms of fruity drinks, it's usually a matter of colour that determines if they're manly or not. As long as a drink is clear or dark in tone, it doesn't matter if it's fruity. Guys will comfortably order clear or dark-toned fruity drinks at a bar (ciroc comes to mind). Anything that has any bright colour in it is considered a girly and dainty drink, and I think that's stupid. It makes me question if society's gender division of alcoholic beverages has any logic to it."

You don't see many pics on here of dudes with bright pink Camaros.

Youtube videos. Drooling over other people's work.  I would say go out and buy some quality tools and some shitty leather and practice, practice, practice. Experiment. Do what works for you. Try out what works for other people. Check out r/leathercraft.  I spend some time every day looking at other people's work. Azmal, Steve B, Terry Henson just to name a few people.

Cain grew up on the Isle of Man and joined the Territorial Army in 1928. After working overseas he was given an emergency commission into the Army in 1940. He transferred to the South Staffordshire Regiment in 1942, and joined their 2nd Battalion, part of the British 1st Airborne Division. He saw action during the Invasion of Sicily in 1943 and again during the Battle of Arnhem the following year. During the battle Major Cain's company was closely engaged with enemy tanks, self-propelled guns and infantry. Cain continually exposed himself to danger while leading his men and personally dispatched as much enemy armour as possible. Despite sustaining several injuries he refused medical attention and for his gallantry he was awarded the Victoria Cross.  Later in the war he took part in Operation Doomsday, where the 1st Airborne Division oversaw the German surrender in Norway. He left the army in late 1945 and returned to his pre-war job at Royal Dutch Shell. He died of cancer in 1974.

Well once they finish service in the army they get FULL citizenship, their immediate families do too and the £17.5K a year they get means their families don't have to work. While serving they get education, healthcare and all the benefits regular squaddies do. Why don't their families work? Well, the average wage in nepal is £190 a year compared to the £17.5K wage the Gurkha get. This is 97 times higher.  In comparison, if someone in the uk was offered this 97X average wage they would get £2,570,500 a year. Over a 30 year stint (minus pay rises) this equates to over SEVENTY FIVE MILLION!

If the wound was preventable, it's probably not fuckingmanly.  If it was out of your control, it counts.  Slicing your finger while excitedly opening your new My Little Pony doesn't count, saving your family from a rabid grizzly does.  2) How bad was it?  If sewing it up isn't necessary, or merely a good idea, meh.  If the clock's ticking on your lifespan, or you have to push parts of your body back inside the wound opening, it counts.  3) How did you react during and afterward?  Calm and casual is everything.  Crying, screaming, excessive swearing/blaming, or running around showing everyone the wound for the pity points gets you nowhere.  If others are vomiting while you whistle and sew up you wound, great.  If no one even knows you were seriously wounded until they see the scar days, weeks or years later, outstanding.  Alternatively, use the Whiskey Rule (not the yuppie version):  If you tell your story to a stranger and they buy you a shot, it's fuckingmanly."

Strauss and Howe lay the groundwork for the theory in their 1991 book Generations, which retells the history of America as a series of generational biographies going back to 1584.  In their 1997 book The Fourth Turning, the authors expanded the theory to focus on a fourfold cycle of generational types and recurring mood eras in American history.  They and their consultancy, LifeCourse Associates, has expanded on the concept in a variety of publications since then.

fuckingmanly,2b1g7w,jblurker09,2,Sat Jul 26 11:21:00 2014 UTC,"I'd change some details, but interesting article.  I'd swap the term ""Heroes"" for ""Hopefuls"", because those generations come of age during various crisis periods, then create grandiose plans for a better society afterward, and never quite grasp why later generations ""lose the faith"".  Call it personal bias (as I am one), but the ""Nomad"" generations should be the ""Heroes"", because they watch the unraveling happen, but still find enough strength to lead/guide the Hopefuls through the Crisis, initially (literally) giving birth to, and (eventually) creating the solid foundation for the Hopefuls' unrelenting faith in humanity.  That's not to take away from the Hopefuls, I just think it fits expectations of the term a little better.  I also think Strauss and Howe missed the mark when they said there was no High Period because of the Civil War.  High periods are marked by Hopefuls entering midlife and their overly-positive, but pragmatic attempts to create a better society.  The Civil War happened because they tried to create pragmatic solutions to the slavery issue until their ""fixes"" blew up in their face and were rejected by the next generation, in the same way that the later generation of Hopefuls tried to pragmatically manage the Cold War until Vietnam escalated and their attempts to manage the problem were rejected by the Boomers."

I doused it with WD-40 and the problem was solved 20 minutes later.
