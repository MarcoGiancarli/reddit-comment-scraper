There is no real authority over them, they are mostly self governing and that needs to end. Even the FBI and DEA, Marshalls service and Secret Service are infested with corruption now. We have to do something before its too late. It almost seems like it is, with stingrays and speed cameras and civil asset seizures that are totally unjustified.

IPRA? That's the Independent Police Review Authority. That's right, supervising investigator Lorenzo Davis, 65, a former Chicago police commander who served the CPD for twenty-three years was terminated because he refused to change his report so that it would be in agreement with the findings of his superiors.    The performance evaluation covered 19 months and concluded that Davis “displays a complete lack of objectivity combined with a clear bias against the police in spite of his own lengthy police career.”   ""How dare he question the actions of the police? And him a former officer himself, no less. Well I never!"" w  Apparently city management isn't even willing to listen to objective criticisms of its police departments even when it's coming from a former officer.    “If there are a few bad police officers who have committed some shootings that are unnecessary or bad then it erodes the public’s confidence in all the other police officers out there,” Davis said.

Bad_Cop_No_Donut,3dxtya,Metabro,31,Tue Jul 21 04:51:39 2015 UTC,"I can speak to that a little, as I've actually done some looking into it.  Per the Bureau of Justice Statistics the average Police Academy in the United States offers about 761 hours of training. That's 19 weeks or 4.7 months of classroom training. Only one third of those academies require actual field training (~453 hours/~3 months).    To put that in perspective,  Electrician -- 4 years apprenticeship/journeyman   Minimum of 144 hours of instruction in the classroom each year. Minimum 2,000 hours of on-the-job training each year, for a total of 8,000 hours.   Plumber -- 4-5 years apprenticeship/journeyman   On-the-job training anywhere from 1,700 to 2,000 hours per year, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.   Mechanic --   Vocational/Post secondary programs typically take anywhere from six to 12 months. Senior mechanic or service technician typically requires two to five years of on-the-job training.   State-Certified Barber, Hairdresser, or Cosmetologist --   Per the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, ""Full-time programs in barbering and cosmetology usually last at least 9 months and may lead to an associate’s degree.""   <<<Insert Police Academy Graduate Here>>>  Certified Nursing Assistant --   Vocational school ~6 to 12 weeks   Commercial Truck/Bus Driver --   Vocational school ~150-240 hours (4-6 weeks)   So, no matter how you slice it, Law Enforcement Officer is pretty much a bottom-of-the-barrel, blue-collar, low education occupation slightly above Nurse and Truck Driver yet significantly below Auto Mechanic and Hairdresser.    Anecdotal -- (so take this with a grain of salt) at least one law enforcement officer discussed in a Reddit thread that their Academy training, as regards Law, amounted to a mere 20 hours (2.5 days) of Lecture followed by 20 hours (2.5 days) of discussion with examples. That's one week out of 19. Another officer referred to this training as ""Bring your NoDoze.""  Not Anecdotal -- If you go to both LAPD and NYPD websites and look into the large amount of information they have touting their training and benefits... there is a glaring and disconcerting lack of mention of ANY training as regards to Civil Rights and Constitutional Law.  LAPD I was able to break down as follows,   Academics: 230 hours Driving: 40 hours Firearms: 113 hours Human Relations: 100 hours Law: 105 hours Physical Training: 142 hours Tactics: 98 hours   TOTAL: 828 hours; 103.5 (8-hour) days; 20.7 (5-day) weeks.  Law Training: 13 days of ""Search and Seizure, evidence, laws of arrest, crimes against persons and property, sex crimes, crimes against children, and other general criminal statutes falling under the California Penal Code, Los Angeles Municipal Code, Welfare and Institutions Code, and Federal Laws.""

So, a 1-, 2-, or most commonly a 4 year degree plus prep time (most people spend around a month of full time studying just on NCLEX prep).

Unethical worthless thugs that don't do anything but make our streets unsafe and ruin lives. They throw people into cages and commit atrocities that go against basic human rights. Most state executions have been done using faulty shitty evidence, many times the DNA evidence shows them innocent after the fact. Supporting the death penalty is literally insane. It's state sanctioned murder. The police are the worst blight on the face of this country, and I'm absolutely disgusted and ashamed at just how many of my fellow ""countrymen"" support this bullshit."

They still won't hire people who score highly like the guy in the article who scored 125.  The idea is that ""they would get bored of the work"" (paraphrasing this from what I can find as their official reasoning for this) and would move on to other fields or college quickly (i.e. they'd be one of the cops who joins and realizes how corrupt and bullshit it is and quits).  I have more, I don't mind sharing more links, and I can find this information corroborated on both MSM and Alt media sites. My take is if both sides are presenting the same information, it's likely to be the truth.  That's the sad part, honestly, if you could speak to me in person, you would probably realize I'm not as biased against police as you think, they just really have earned their nasty reputation."

That officer was trapped, unable to work the door handles from the inside, and he helped the officer.  You seem to be forgetting that police dogs are officers, and they are fully as good as you or me.  By cop logic, police dogs are cops so they are actually our betters.  He opened a door for the officer, and that officer wouldn't have left its vehicle had it not wanted to.  tl;dr:  He was assisting an actual police officer, and this was his payback.

I was of the understanding they were supposed to hold a press conference yesterday morning, but shortly after, the family asked everyone they knew to share the arrest video and the story in hopes it would go viral.  Looks like it has.  The story has now made it's way to USA Today, Wash. Post, Daily Mail and Huffington Post.   They have raised nearly $16K through the donation site so any mainstream media attention this receives can only help contribute in supporting Troy's wife and 15 month old son he left behind. Being only 30 years old, I don't know if he had a life insurance policy or not.  This shit has got to stop and I for one want to know when the turning point happened in this country when innocent civilians became targeted by police. I know that I do not recall this type of excessive use of force against citizens before 911, but now with homeland security and the implementation of programs like the DOD 1033 program that outfits local PD municipalities across the country with the latest in high tech military gear, incidents like this are far more frequent, daily even, fuck, hourly even."
Bad_Cop_No_Donut,3dxtya,wuzizname,-7,Tue Jul 21 12:30:38 2015 UTC,"I will remain open minded on this. I have asthma and laying face down, unless my face and mouth are packed with pillows or blankets or something, wouldn't necessarily kill me... also I know that if I can speak, ""I can't breath"", that I can and am breathing.  Add that to the fact he was transferred to hospital alive and took 2 hours before he died (presumable after oxygen was administered)... and his crazy behaviour of jumping out of the car and running around like a crazy person in a mall parking lot.. this sounds like misadventure induced by drugs or alcohol or a mixture of - both of which can seriously complicate asthma if not cause problems on their own.  I'm hoping for a follow up or spectator video as the article suggests."
Bad_Cop_No_Donut,3dxtya,brokenmind87,7,Mon Jul 20 19:38:29 2015 UTC,"Try a thought experiment for me..  Imagine you are in the middle of an asthma attack, and instead of getting help you are instead hogtied and placed belly down on a solid material. You can't move your arms, or shoulders, to help your diagphram from contracting.  Is what happened really such an open scenario? Especially when we have tons of these cases, with VIDEO, popping out every week..?"
Bad_Cop_No_Donut,3dxtya,wuzizname,2,Mon Jul 20 19:52:20 2015 UTC,"I understand completely and know where you're coming from, that situation is certainly not ideal for anyone with asthma.. but neither is running around in circles in a parking lot. The thing that stuck out in the article the most was that he was successfully transferred to hospital, and the procedure for handing off of custody (again assuming the cops followed proper procedure) is that the hospital assumes responsibility of care and has to acknowledge that they have the patient under their care once a patient is handed off. And the hospital reported that the patient was initially stable, only to have him expire hours later.  There's a lot of fuckery going on and cops getting exposed for a lot of bullshit, agreed, but there are some legit questions and unknowns to pursue here, imho, and like I said I'm reserving any opinion until there's more info and autopsy results or any spectator videos coming to the surface."

Hold your hand tight over your mouth and nose. Try hard to say ""I can't breathe"". Keep the same pressure and try to inhale, you can't.   It is easy to overcome pressure to exhale, getting air back into your lungs is the problem."
