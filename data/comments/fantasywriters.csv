fantasywriters,3e5i3d,trane7111,5,Wed Jul 22 02:51:17 2015 UTC,"Short version: read and write.   Longer version: Read a lot. Read different authors. Read outside of the fantasy genre. Read works from different eras. You will gradually absorb different styles, different ways of expressing ideas and achieving results.   Couple that with writing. Write every day. Set a realistic word count target and stick to it. Don't be concerned with whether it's publishable or not. Just write. Feel free to emulate the authors you're reading.   After a while you'll find the styles blend together with your own thoughts and ideas. By reading and writing a variety of authors and styles you'll gradually develop your own style."
fantasywriters,3e5i3d,Sisiutil,2,Wed Jul 22 04:05:11 2015 UTC,"Some sound advice.  This is something that you can only learn by doing and there's no quick path to it.  One thing that you might consider doing is taking some of the passages that you like and breaking them down.  Look at the use of phrasing and sentence structure, look for instances of unusual grammar and ask why they give the right feel.  I'm currently reading Mark Lawrence's The Liar's Key, but in analysing his work I noticed that he loves to end a paragraph with a witty one liner, as thought by the character.  This helps keep you 'in the head' of the character as well as giving a pause after each joke.  Analyse those texts you enjoy."
fantasywriters,3e5i3d,Azincourt,2,Wed Jul 22 06:46:52 2015 UTC,"Look at the way conflicts generates a kind of thematic dialogue. Often the power of a particular passage comes from its juxtaposition with other passages or its position in a story. To draw a military parallel, the glorious cavalry charge might be decisive, but is only so because the infantry first pinned the enemy. I wrote a long blog entry analyzing how Tolkien makes his landscape pron work - you might find it useful.  Also, when analyzing at specific passages, look for the boundaries between internal and external experience and see how the author handles them. Usually there's a rhythm of passage with the character in it/passage without the character in it but from the character's subjective POV with little or no filtering.  Look at how different writers handle each side of this differently, being more or less interior. Sometimes the character passage is entirely cinematic with only visual clues as to how they are feeling. Writers also cheerfully violate it for comic effect  Hope that helps."

fantasywriters,3e3o7z,AndreaGS,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:50:36 2015 UTC,"Good analogy for the synopsis being a slimmed down version of the novel.

fantasywriters,3e3o7z,Ezraah,3,Wed Jul 22 05:50:49 2015 UTC,"Right! Here are my major points of confusion, and the things that would personally turn me off from reading this. Minor comments are on lines in your file. I won't be giving you line edits, because they'd probably be lost in a greater overhaul.   Plot confusion & critique   Why in the world would Dragon and Mother, human-made constructs, not operate at their 'full potential' by default? Why would inserting a sacrifice (Arya) make Mother more powerful? Why would Luke do the same for Dragon?   Luke starts out with a goal and motivation that nothing ever comes of, his Test. It's the kind of dead end that can read like an aborted plot line. I would find a different way of phrasing his reason to find Dragon.  Luke, a stranger with no credibility, can simply join the adventuring party of Arya, someone revered as the 'savior'? I mean, you mention some paragraphs later that everyone's suspicious of him, so why was he allowed to join in the first place? (I dearly hope it isn't Arya falling in love at first sight.) Luke's 'it's only a simulation' attitude makes me think he will be rather dull to read about until his revelation. The this isn't real anyway excuse can be used to dismiss anything he encounters, rationalize anything he does.   It feels far-fetched for Arya to marry the Son just for the people's happiness and prayers of dubious usefulness. The priest ought to be offering something of more concrete value, something necessary to proceed the plot, the journey.   You neglect to explain how Luke realizes he's not in a simulation anymore. This is pivotal to his development and should be in the synopsis. You neglect to tell why Arya 'tries to activate a hidden message'. She's the one who chose to marry the Son -- why does take a different course of action now? What in the world was in the message to constitute treason? What does it even mean to 'activate' a message? Several pieces of vital information are missing here.  We have no idea what Arya's father did to be considered a traitor, or why his redemption is a driving force for Arya. Why did the daughter of a traitor become the 'savior' anyway? If she was chosen as a disposable sacrifice, your synopsis should state this clearly, not make me figure it out by working backwards.   How is luke suddenly acquainted with the rebels, or at least know how to find them?  Your finale is way too detailed in comparison to the rest. 'Dormant energy pylons', what the hell?   Conclusion  I liked the story, honestly. It's imaginative, and the 'it was all just a dream HAHA JUST KIDDING' is an amusing sequel hook. I'm a little wary about Luke as a protagonist though -- his origin actively works against him. It pushes him toward apathy, and his ignorance of the world seems similar to an amnesia plot device, in the sense that it allows him to ask other characters obvious questions and be fed exposition through dialogue.   This synopsis needs to cut down on details, however. Rather than explain the points of confusion I listed above, write in a way so that they don't exist.    Hope this helps!"
fantasywriters,3e3o7z,Azincourt,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:10:42 2015 UTC,"Hi Seikah,   Thank you SO much for the detailed feedback, it'll be great to guide my revision process. I have answers in the story (good ones, I think) to all of those questions, but as you say, the trick is writing the synopsis is to do it ""in a way so they don't exist"". That'll be quite tricky to do, but I guess that's why good writers get paid for their work, right? Anyway, back to work...  (PS: w/r/t ""falling in love at first sight""--ABSOLUTELY NOT!!!! haha)"
fantasywriters,3e3o7z,wallabingbing,3,Wed Jul 22 05:36:53 2015 UTC,"Hi LAN-awake!  I left comments on the actual synopsis, though I do agree with others that this needs to be trimmed down. A synopsis should be a bare-bones retelling of your plot. What are your characters goals, what do they do, what stops them, how does the whole shebang end?  I'd recommend cutting the exposition. Weave some of this through the synopsis only as it's necessary to understand the story.  Passive voice was a big problem for me throughout. I marked it in most places. If you can add ""by zombies"" to the sentence and have it make grammatical sense, you're using passive voice. ""The pylons are activated by zombies."" If you want your characters to sound active, use active voice. And there's the problem that, by using passive voice, you're obscuring the actors, which makes the plot a bit more hazy...because who's doing this stuff?  I found there to be too many proper nouns. I was having problems keeping track. Can you find shorthand ways to refer to some of these? And there didn't seem to be a plot reason to identify all these companions/Knights, except maybe the Enforcer.  Good--your characters are moving about, doing stuff, actively working toward their goals. I can see something of the plot through the chaff, but I think you need to trim and clarify. Say as much as possible in as few words as possible.  The synopsis is basically so that the publisher can see that you know how to plot, that you've got a good structure, and your ending doesn't jump the shark. Focus on delineating the plot.  I hope this helps! I've done the synopsis thing several times; I know it's hard to distill the story down while still making it clear--especially for fantasy/sf."

I really do like your comment about focusing on the characters' goals as well, definitely gives a better feel for the ""human element"" of the story.   The main problem with removing the passive voice stuff is that I was obscuring the actors on purpose, because they're entirely different characters causing some of these plot points that would have just added more pronouns...I'll have to be creative to fix that. Hmmmmmm. That ""by zombies"" test will be useful for sure.   Reducing pronouns will be helpful. What this process has done for me is to highlight the really necessary actors/information for the basic story, and it's great to hear from someone who's done this before in the genre!"
fantasywriters,3e4lxr,LJAE,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:31:22 2015 UTC,"There are no fantasy elements apparent in this story.  I assume that something supernatural is going to take place later on.  I didn't find this scene believable.  A woman has been followed and watched by a man, so much so that she has gone to the police about it, but when she sees him watching her in a club she... tries to get off with a stranger?  The thing possibly most likely to make things worse?  Assuming his motives were sexual in nature, which is what you'd assume, then this would no doubt be inadvisable.  I just don't believe that a woman would act this way.  She could call the police, or she could try to get lost in the crowd and get away as fast as possible, call a cab - but instead she makes out with a guy?  Her plan is to just go home with him so she's not followed, but of course the stalker could follow her and the guy then just wait for her to leave and follow her then instead, right?  I enjoyed some of the descriptions and thought you set the scene well.  The writing style was generally enjoyable, although I think that the dialogue needs some work."

fantasywriters,3dwgni,MeggieMoo17,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:43:01 2015 UTC,"Hey! Great job on a rough draft. I can see that you really have a clear vision for this story.  A few things:  First, I found the descriptions a bit distracting. It's just, in my opinion, a little over the top. Is it relevant to the story exactly what the protagonist is wearing, and exactly the layout of the room? Probably not.  Your readers have imaginations! For example, when you tell us they are not well off, and are a farming family, that already implies that the clothes are plain and well worn.   Second, I understand that this is a rough draft and you are sure to expand on this, but the big reveal here seemed so casual. ""Grace-Louise, how is your supper? Oh by the way, you're not really our kid, I found you in the woods. You know how your not-dad hates you? Well his parents are coming to town, so he is going to have you killed. K?"" ""K.""   Why would a farming family kill off an able bodied worker? Why now? Why would the villagers just accept she is a changeling and go after her? Why would the mother reveal the whole story instead of sending her to live with a relative?   Anyways, I'd be happy to expand more if you're interested, and help out where I can. Keep writing!"

This was the thing that I had the most trouble with out of all the writing I've done so far: I couldn't for the life of me decide why Grace-Louise was forced to leave her home. I settled on this, but it's by no means permanent. It's important (vital, actually) to the development of the story that she leave the country, not just the small area where her family lives."

fantasywriters,3dwgni,Rapscallion84,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:19:55 2015 UTC,"It is certainly description heavy. This is probably just a personal preference, but I'm not fond of narrative that leaves no room for imagination.   I hope you don't feel too offended by my next criticism. After the second paragraph I was already emotionally distancing myself from Grace-Louise. Let's list her qualities:   'Cheerful' auburn hair  Double-barrelled name  Tall for a girl, yet still in proportion  Well muscled, but lean and still very feminine  Cheerful face  Large brown, sparkling eyes  Narrow nose  Freckles  Has a ready smile   As if the description wasn't enough, you then directly state that she is objectively pretty. I couldn't help roll my eyes at the next statement:   'Grace-Louise herself was much loved and adored by all, her family and the people of the nearest village'   For me, it's just too much. Grace-Louise reads like another double-barrelled named trope that I shan't mention.   Granted, a 30 year old man is probably not your target audience, however by the second paragraph you've already alienated me. Given the narrow market share of fantasy (and the abundance of my particular gender/age combination within this genre), is that something you can afford to do? Just a thought."
fantasywriters,3dwgni,Rapscallion84,1 point,Mon Jul 20 11:01:31 2015 UTC,"Hi, thank you for taking the time to read my work! I get what you're saying about having too much description. I guess I just feel like in a lot of my other works there's not nearly enough description; there are quite a few characters who even I don't know what they look like, their age, their attitude, etc. I guess I overcompensated a bit in the beginning of this story, though it does even out a bit as the story progresses. I'll see what I can do about reducing the amount of description while still giving the audience a glimpse of Grace-Louise."
fantasywriters,3dwgni,ArcaneRedguard,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:01:23 2015 UTC,"May I suggest that you do a little more showing and a little less telling? For example, have Grace-Louise working alongside her sisters, however they are lazy and she does most of the work. The father comes out and invites the girls in for lunch (rabbit stew?), all except Grace-Louise, whom he hands some bread and a slice of cheese. Moments after they go inside, Rhea comes out and sneaks her some of the stew.  In this way, you're showing the reader that Grace-Louise works harder than her sisters, the father seems to dislike her, that Rhea is more compassionate towards her, and that the family may be struggling to survive."

I only read scene 1.   In general, I liked what you wrote. I read all of it. There are a few grammar mistakes here and there, a few missing commas or full stops, a few wrong contractions or wrong verbs, but we all make those mistakes, and they're not important now on in the writing process.   The only thing I had a problem with, especially on the first few pages, was the pacing. It was supposed to be a battle scene, and in battle scenes things go and move quickly and suddenly, not slowly while taking in the surroundings. I understand you want to show your readers the setting, but you can leave many things to the reader's imagination as well. Some things are important, the muddy ground, the mist, but other things... not so much. I suggest you cut out a few sentences.   Berek seems like an interesting character. How he treats Thim at the end tells us a great deal about him. His type of person, proud and highborn, is a great type of character to develop over a journey, as I suppose you will be doing in your story.   Overall I say keep up the good work, watch your pacing though."

Would you believe the pacing was much worse in the first draft? I removed several paragraphs, but maybe there's still more to do. I'll make a note in the doc about revising the pacing.   Yes, Berek is in for a complete transformation. I think under it all he's a decent guy, but he'll need to have his corners knocked off before the real Berek can shine through.   Thanks again!"
fantasywriters,3du2bo,RedFern900,2,Sun Jul 19 17:56:52 2015 UTC,"i get that you're trying to start off with some action to get things moving, but i felt a little lost in the beginning. i think you need to set the scene a bit more first before you start the ambush. i don't really know who Berek is or what he's doing or why it's important, and then you throw him into a battle.  i think it would help if you explained in the beginning where Berek and his group are supposed to be taking the weapons. when i'm reading this, i don't know if they're important for some kind of war effort, or if it's a really valuable and important trade shipment, or what.   in fact, i honestly feel like you could just cut part 1 and have the story begin at part 2, with Berek cold and miserable and remembering how terrible the attack went and thinking about how pissed everyone is going to be that the weapons got stolen. i liked part 2 a lot more than part 1, i feel like you explained things much better about who everyone is and what's going on.  one of the biggest things i notice is you have a lot of spelling and grammar problems like unnecessary commas, awkward sentence structures, sentence fragments, typos, etc. these are only a few things from part 1, but there's a lot more of the same issues throughout everything.   ""hair's breadth"" not breath. ""gasping to catch his breath"" not breathe. ""headlong"" not head-long. ""it's"" is a contraction for ""it is"" and you're using this form instead of the possessive ""its"" many times throughout the story like when he finds the dead troll. try to bone up on how to structure dialogue. you don't need punctuation after the end quote. like the sentence    ""Get your dirty hands off me slave."", Berek spat.   should be   ""Get your dirty hands off me, slave,"" Berek spat.   Part 1:   what is the relevance of Berek finding the half-troll corpse? seems like kind of a pointless scene. i don't understand what Berek means when he's explaining his family. he's son of King Tallagh AND foster son of Lugga ? what does that mean? i'm assuming this was some kind of peace deal between the two clans...? (ok i see you explained this more in part 2, but reading it at the time was confusing) so at first i wasn't sure if Frisk had deserted and joined the bandits, but it seems like he was one of Berek's men, right? why is he almost about to kill Berek even after Berek identifies himself? that scene is really confusing.   Part 2:   you say ""nine out of fifteen men"" survived the ambush, but in part 1 you said  ""their group of twenty were outnumbered.""  Aghrugh told Berek to get rid of his nice warm cloak in part 1 because it's no good for the road. then in part 2 Berek is cold and miserable and wrapped up in a smelly horse blanket to defend against the ""harsh elements""...? why didn't he just keep his cloak? who is Ward? you bring him up a few times but don't explain who he is."
fantasywriters,3du2bo,hazardp,2,Sun Jul 19 16:56:23 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your feedback. My grammar skills are certainly lacking, but your notes have really helped, and I've already applied some changes to the first scene.   Confusion at the start. I added a line to try highlight the importance of the cargo, but will come back to this section, see if I can clear up the confusion.  Part 1: The Half-Troll is there for foreshadowing. Trolls and Half-Trolls come more into the story later. There's a clumsy attempt at symbolism here, Berek loses the bronze sword, and finds the flint axe. This ties in later with a change in his circumstances. I'll make a note in the document to revisit this.   The fostering section had an explaination in draft 1, but feedback suggested it was too long. I thought I could safely hint at it in sc1, then expand in sc2, maybe that doesn't work too well. Made a note in doc.  Frisk is making an assassination attempt on Berek. This ties in with the plot, the motivation is revealed (probably before the end of chapter 2...I'm still working on that)  I tried to show there was something wrong with his behaviour, but maybe it's still not coming across clearly enough. Maybe Aghrugh might ask Berek if there was any reason he knew of why Frisk would want to kill him?  Part2:  You have found another weakness; after grammar comes maths. I have corrected this, thanks!  The cloak question - yes good point. I'll have to figure this out. Great feedback.  Ward is Berek's foster brother. He was explained in the first draft, but feedback pointed out it slowed the pace, was too much of an info-dump.  I thought I could push the explanation out, but mention him here. Kind of a foreshadowing attempt."
fantasywriters,3du2bo,Oduku,2,Sun Jul 19 17:51:11 2015 UTC,"Hi U/bluebeardreturns,  I read and commented on the previous draft of scene one.  I've just read the revised version of that scene, I'll try and get back to the next scene later.  This new draft is a whole lot better.  It flows much more naturally.  Pulling the info-dump sections out has made it feel a lot more organic.  I think the overall structure now works much more effectively.  A few minor points to think about:   watch your tenses.  Sometimes you slip between the past and the present.  E.g. ""Hooves trampled and skid in the rich black mud, a hair's breadth from his face."" Don't overload the reader with adjectives or overly-descriptive language.  Less is more.  As you get into the action sequence the writing gets better, this is particularly a problem in the early paragraphs. Berek is saying a lot less stuff out loud than in the last version, but there's still quite a lot of things that are put in quote marks that are a bit distracting.  E.g. ""There's something familiar about him"", Berek thought.  This would be more immediate and effective if it were simple: ""Berek recognised the man."" In terms of plot, I still don't quite buy the scene where Frisk is killed.  I think there needs to be something earlier that establishes either:  a) Aghrugh is arbitrarily violent, and willing to act wildly to defend Berek. OR  b) Frisk was not entirely oblivious to the identity of the man he was about to kill. At the moment, it reads as though Frisk made a mistake in the middle of battle, and is rather purposelessly killed for it.  I also think the line that Arghrugh speaks is a bit cheesy and unconvincing.  It sounds like something from a 60s Bond movie.  Maybe this would be more effective if it was turned into a threat against the rest of the (living) assembled warriors?     I think the main take-away is that this is a huge improvement on the previous draft - the changes you've put in have made a big difference.  Hope those comments are of some use!  Will try and get round to the second scene later today."
fantasywriters,3du2bo,Oduku,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:29:25 2015 UTC,"Hi Hazardp, thanks for commenting.   The tenses thing - thanks for pointing that out. It is something that creeps in from time to time, I'll make edits. I'll make note to revisit the earlier paragraphs with a view to streamlining them. I'm struggling with dialogue at the moment, writhing chapter 2. I can be a 'bit of a talker' myself, but talking, and writing believable dialogue are two different disciplines. ""Berek recognised the man."" - why didn't I think of that? :) Frisk's death: I tried to describe Frisk's actions as being a bit more shady in this draft, but it's not working for people. His death is an important part of the plot, as the thirst for revenge motivates Frisk's father to pursue Berek (thus putting him under pressure) throughout the rest of the story.    Do you think it would work if Aghrugh, after killing Frisk, asks Berek if he knows why Frisk would want to assassinate him? Not that exact language, but that would be the gist of it.  Thanks. I hope you can read scene 2. I moved some of the exposition (info-dump) in there, and think it works okay."
fantasywriters,3du2bo,p01yg0n41,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:29:55 2015 UTC,"I think you use commas far too often and it makes your sentences hard to read. You should rework many of them and in the rest drop most of the commas. They're not needed and disrupt the natural pace at which the reader goes through the sentence.   One of Berek's guards toppled to the ground, a few feet away. He was thrashing violently on his back, his bloody hands clawing at a broken spear jutting out of his chest.   You could easily remove that comma or put that chunk in the beginning. ""A few feet away, one of Berek's guards toppled to the ground and began violently thrashing, his bloody hands clawing at a broken spear jutting out of his chest."" That sentence sounds much better in my opinion."

I'm going to be brutal about this; your ideas are so heavily based on computer games that you are really just taking the ideas wholesale.  I'd recommend that you try writing it as fan fiction, instead of going through the difficulty of having to rename all the elements of Final Fantasy.  I get the impression that you probably haven't read many fantasy books before, and that's not necessarily a bad thing or a problem in itself, but all your posts indicate that you want to write up the games you've really enjoyed into a story.  By all means enjoy writing it, but don't worry about the legalities.  I don't think you need to worry about copyrights.  It's not going to be publishable anyway, and even if you self publish it's going to be too small fry for Square Enix to worry about it."

Exercise your writing muscles and see how you go, because the fact that you are:   borrowing from other things   needs to made very clear and not only that, acknowledged.  Credit to the creative work of others is respectful and should be standard practice for anyone writing.  And then, as you say, when you feel more confident, you can give it a go to try your hand as creating and being original. :)  Good luck!"

fantasywriters,3dtqfs,Bitsworth-,3,Sun Jul 19 11:03:09 2015 UTC,"I would strongly suggest using different terms for your classes, as Red Mage in particular is very specific to the Final Fantasy franchise, and White and Black Mages are close on the border there. You can probably get away with using the terms Black Mage and White mage, since the concept of black and white magic existed long before Final Fantasy came out, but even then I'd suggest trying something a little more original. You might keep your color divisions solely amongst your magic users, while using the fact that the warrior wears armor and bristles with weapons, the thief dresses in light armor that blends in, and the unarmed martial fighter dresses in simple cloth as ways to distinguish them via uniform. The best way to distinguish your characters of course being to have them each be strongly developed, individual characters in their own right."
fantasywriters,3dtqfs,Wordsmithgirl,2,Sun Jul 19 11:58:12 2015 UTC,"White/Red/Black mages were also a key component of Dragonlance. The idea is sound, but I think it's also overdone, and audiences (which include publishers) are looking for different things."
fantasywriters,3dtqfs,crowqueen,6,Sun Jul 19 12:01:28 2015 UTC,"Sounds more like Power Rangers than LOTR to me.  I don't know what a 'Red Mage' or a 'White Mage' is supposed to be - is this something you've taken wholesale from another medium?  Final Fantasy or something like that (I don't play it)?  With the colours applied these aren't 'typical' RPG classes so I don't really know why a white mage is different to a red anyway.  However, in purely writing terms, if you call a character a 'white mage' then I'm going to assume that it's because they wear white.  It would be very odd if they were then wearing pink whilst the red mage wore white.  You might want to consider whether this is really a very strong element of a story, though.  Real people don't just wear a single colour all of the time unless it's specifically to identify themselves as being part of a particular group (e.g. goths), and even then they probably wear different clothes to go to work than they do when they get to choose their own.  Do your characters get together and say ""hey let's all be a different colour!"" or are we meant to assume that they just happen to all wear monochrome outfits?  Either way, it seems daft."
fantasywriters,3dtqfs,Azincourt,2,Sun Jul 19 11:14:37 2015 UTC,"Yeah I should have clarified a bit. A lot of these terms are from Final Fantasy. The name of the color of mage is just based off what kind of magic they use (a white Mage used white magic, black uses black magic). A red mage doesn't actually use red magic (there's no such thing) but they use white and black magic along with swords. Yeah, a white Mage wears white but they're called that more for the type of magic they use (like a black Mage in final fantasy almost never actually wear black)."
fantasywriters,3dtqfs,crowqueen,7,Sun Jul 19 11:22:55 2015 UTC,"FF is a visual medium - a video game. In prose, the characters' appearances are secondary to the characterisation, plot and setting; not many people will see the characters exactly as you imagine them, and while sometimes it's a good idea to have a peg on which to hang a visual identity on them, it's not something that really works quite as well without you being able to show us an objective image. Unless it really has an impact on the plot - say, an identifying livery that marks someone out as a 'white' mage, like in Dragonlance - then I'm not sure that it's needed, particularly not if it's linked purely to personality rather than is something that is part of a setting.   Also, I saw your post on /r/writing where you go into more detail about your characters. They sounded very archetypal and not really the sort of characters I'd expect to enjoy in a book: you need to think how this flows naturally from your keyboard or pen and how these characters develop when you write their story, rather than having fixed archetypes. I think it's a real challenge to make something based on LOTR and FF work well in a genre where people are writing about anthropomorphic, humanoid insects, blood and guts and slavery (there is a LOT of slavery in modern works - it's not actually endorsed, but it's the one thing that people are actually being honest about), moody blokes with cloaks and swords standing on piles of bodies, and so on. The characters you're writing sound like archetypes that would make sense in a 1980s books (e.g. Dragonlance), but not one published recently. I felt a bit curmudgeonly about posting that on the other thread and deleted what I said, but I think you're going to get similar answers here, as /u/Azincourt proves.  Also, gaming fiction doesn't focus on strict classes. Even the D&D books acted as if the traditional distinctions weren't there - they might drop in things like a bard being able to cast arcane spells, but they'd do it so the character background made sense (some minor magical talent or tuition with a wizard who was frustrated at his pupil's light-hearted take on their craft and lack of dedication to the more esoteric ars magica in favour of minor illusions, cantrips, magic missiles and flashy showy stuff, and the character independently learns to cast spells while singing and playing; the guy has a natural skill with a rapier and was able to combine his magical and musical training with a bit of fencing) rather than saying 'Danilo is a Bard so he can cast X spells through Y instrument and can wield Z weapons'.  The market is radically different and I think you need to have a look at some modern fantasy before you commit to this story in its current format. Obviously, if it's just for fun, ignore what I'm saying - you and your hard drive can enjoy it together. You may find in writing you gain other influences from more modern works that help smooth over some of the rigid definitions in there, and develop the characters away from purely stock gaming characters. But writing for the modern market...the times have changed radically and even if you want to reject those newer works and work with a more enlightened and upbeat idea, you need to start with what's out there now and examine how you can orientate your work towards that audience. There's room in the market for non-grimdark work, but I think there needs to be a bit more input into your output because of the vast shifts in the fantasy market between LOTR and modern writing."
fantasywriters,3dtqfs,crowqueen,2,Sun Jul 19 11:57:45 2015 UTC,I realize now I probably should have said that this isn't just a story as in for a novel it's actually more for a comic... I didn't realize there would be a difference in the possible response. Also I went under the guise of just a regular story because I wasn't sure if anything other than traditional novels were allowed here. Also another reason why I went with colors is since it's also a visual medium (being drawn and all). Sorry for the confusion
fantasywriters,3dtqfs,crowqueen,2,Sun Jul 19 18:57:12 2015 UTC,"No, that's fine. Comics are good and some of us do them as well as prose. As far as the mods are concerned, anything that could be construed as writing is fair game. (We have screenwriters, game-writers and freeform forum role-players come here, so comics are welcome :) :) :).)  The graphics are up to you, and that does change something. However, again, think about what's more natural. If the colour codes are subtle, it could work fairly well. If it's obvious...I dunno. They might start to look like chess pieces, and you'd have to take account of what the background characters are wearing.   I guess the solution is that the more natural-looking you can make it while incorporating the colour schemes into it, the better; I think the trend as I said is towards realism and more subtle gradients of characterisation, rather than archetypes/stock tropes/etc. The more reading you can do around this the better, because the more influences you have, the better you can blend them together and the better you fit in with what's being done around you."
fantasywriters,3dtqfs,Azincourt,2,Sun Jul 19 19:03:06 2015 UTC,"Yeah, like if the warrior was to wear red I mean it more like his chest plate and boots would be red or something, not like all of him."

In the list of things I look for in a fantasy, that's not even on the 1st page.  I want interesting, well-developed characters, fresh, liquid dialogue, tight action scenes and a plot with a sense of dread urgency, among other things.  It's easy to get too wrapped up in worldbuilding, because it's the easy, fun part of writing.  I think there's a very real danger of getting so involved with the details of worldbuilding that you neglect working on the difficult, more important part of writing: practicing your writing skills.  Just like with any other sort of of writing research, you only need as many background details as are necessary to tell the story."

That said, the magic system OP describes seems filled with inconsequential details that I don't see becoming important for either plot or character.

I didn't read your magic system - since there's no story attached to it, I can't see what could possibly be interesting to me about it.  I can't follow any characters, I can't be interested in a dialogue or some kind of danger... who exactly would be interested in it?  When you get around to writing your story, everything on that Wiki is just so much chaff in the wind.  You'll probably ignore most of it.  Most of it won't even be relevant to the story that you have to tell.  Draw up a plot, a few characters that you're going to tell a tale about and start thinking about a plot to write!"

fantasywriters,3dka3q,Atheose_Writing,3,Thu Jul 16 23:45:28 2015 UTC,"Cool. Okay. Now I've pulled it apart, so if you are not ready for that, do not read on. The premise is interesting and the content appropriate for a prologue. If you want a break-down of where I think things can be improved, do read on.  So you have the poem, which is sort of a prologue in itself. Don't mind it.    One star to die, never to be seen again.   This line could do with work as it falls a little flat.  The questions are a bit over the top for me. A bit superfulous and blatant. Not very subtle. But then I like subtle, so there you go.   A city was ablaze,    'The' is more appropriate here as we have no other cities in view.   thick soot clogging the once pristine air.    I just want 'smoke' here, which caused me to look up soot and see why it offended me so. I am no science scholar but from what I did understand, I think soot does not come from fire but fuel burning.    Virens, the once proud capital city of Lothe (I think you need a comma here)   was besieged by feral men garbed in furs and leathers.    Well, no sure you need the plural, unless they are massively layered...   They had come from the far north,    Okay I'm being pendantic as you don't have comments turned on your doc, so doing it here. 'far north' as opposed to the close north?   invading the once gentle nation   They are not gentle farmers anymore?   of farmers like a horde of locusts, and leaving the city smoldering ruins.   Personally I think the juxtaposition of locusts (chewing little devilish beasties) does not work with the burning to ruins image.   scraggly black hair damaged by ash and soot   Ash and soot does not really damage hair. Embers, hot ash possibly does by burning it. Just makes it dirty, can wash it out.   Tears fell from dark gray eyes   Whose? Hers? You can say. :) You mention ash and soot far too many times in this paragraph.   soot stained a once beautiful, now torn to rags gown   If it is torn to rags, I don't imagine she will be worried about a little soot. And now with all this mention of soot and ash, I'm thinking how did she get this way? Close encounters with the smoke and fires obviously, so she'd be coughing her little lungs out by now. Extend the image, bring us right in.   A signet ring was upon her finger, showing a majestic multiple-winged crow.   I get your are going for a trad fantasy archaic kind of tone, but 'upon her finger' sounds a little bit pretentious. And to tell us among all this doom and gloom, ash and soot the crow is 'majestic', well. Not sure you need to.   Though she had lost her baby brother in the process, sacrificing himself for her   You nearly lost me here. She is small. Sure I've now idea how old, but her 'baby' brother sacrifices himself for her? Um. How noble. I would either say how, so we we are not thinking, yeah - right, or just say she lost him. I feel like I need a point for this to be even mentioned. This bit is about her, not him, imo.   The walls were in the classical style   Which was? Prologues, if you are going to do them, need to be to the point. They need to include info I need to know. So either tell me the style or don't mention it.   Iconography of a phoenix-like creature   Okay, pov is little girl. Would she not know what this creature was, and would she be noticing it? And 'iconography', not sure if this is the word you really want here?    ""Won't anyone come save us?"" she begged.   'us'? It is a city of ghosts. Everyone she knows is dead. Wouldn't it more likely to be 'me'?   A grandfatherly voice reached her   Can you show how it is grandfatherly rather than tell us?  I think you need to read through and think about the progression of events as you have shown them to us.    She looked up as her chin was cupped, forcing her to look up.   Look is repeated. And a second ago the voice reached her, indicating distance and suddenly some stranger is lifting her chin. I'd be slapping the thing away.   The princess's hopes were answered...maybe.   ... maybe? Ooh. Not loving this. Show us don't tell us.    It was an obese old man   'He', not it.   sickly green orbs   Orbs can actually mean a lot of things. If you mean eyes, say eyes. If the orbs are dangling around his neck, say that too.   He wore gray robes that looked like the plumage of a bird, looking like a fat vulture.   ""looked"", ""looking"". Try and think of a way of avoiding repitition.   he looked at the altar, seeing a twisted resemblance   By now I've forgotten there is a phoenix thingo on there, so I'd consider saying she is looking at the carving, or painting or whatever it might be.   He shook his head,   I have trouble remembering this, but I'm pretty sure actions before dialogue is a period, not a comma. :)   Do not fear child...I offer you a chance to live.""   Why the elipisis? I think a period offers the same pause you are thinking of. Unless you are indicating missing speech.   She felt as if she had no choice but to take it.   Sensible girl. But how old is she? I might deliberate on her choice a bit. She does not immediately think this stranger is in any way responsible for the ruin and burning, which surprised me. I would have thought she would been a bit more afraid. Men have tried to grab her already.   she wanted vengeance,    I think you might just be going for something a bit too simplistic here. Why? Up to now she has wanted mostly to be saved and is sad her family is dead. Did she see her baby brother hacked to bits? I'm imagining a quite young girl here. I need a bit more to take this on board.   He snickered   He did? Mate, horses snicker, but hey if that is the sound you are going for.   Rules as the queen of the Court of Ghosts...   Not a complete sentence.   She nodded, ""My life is yours, my god.""   Well she is easily persuaded...   ""There is no turning back now,""   Bit cliche.   Zebal's emblem branded itself where he touched. The symbol of a stylized vulture's skull and scythe appeared there. She couldn't even feel it, the pain was nothing compared to what she had already faced.   Okay, first two sentences need reworking to flow together. And is her stomach bare? I really need to know how old she is because that is not creepy at all! And pain? What pain? Not mentioned up to now. Are we talking metaphysical or literal?   She inquired, ""Ghost Queen?""   Not enough info for this sentence to make sense, it reads as if she is enquiring of the the Ghost Queen.    ""It shrouds you in mystery,""    It does? Why? Is that his only reason? He's a God, I thought he might have more to say.   living servants of you kingdom,   'your' little typo. :)   ""This is your ruler, your lady! Your princess returned from the depths of anguish!""   This is your ruler! Your lady! - Queen surely?   They all kneeled. So this was power?   Um, she is a princess, they don't normally kneel to her?    He became a cloud of locusts before    I like this, did you mean it echo the locusts at the beginning?   and glowing sickly green at the joints rose   Something whacky happening with your construction here...  Hope this is useful, you've got some interesting content to work with here. Good luck!"

You'd run out of words for a start. ;P But also you could also end up with a thesaurus, not a book. As with everything it is balance, you want a tone and style and you want consistency. Key word repetition can be the foundation for this. The trick is not using too many or too few.   I'd love to know where you read that...

fantasywriters,3ddw6h,showmethebluprints,2,Wed Jul 15 14:40:21 2015 UTC,"First of all, you're right, this works more as a prologue to me than a 1st chapter.   The good thing about this chapter is that you're got the POV down. We're seeing everything through Gareth's eyes.   There's a few things you should work on. One is work on showing and not telling. Here's an example.   Gareth Tarlow was among the crowd on the streets. He blended in seamlessly, the long sword at his side hidden beneath a woolen cloak that was fashioned in the current style.   If you did something like:    Gareth Tarlow slipped between the gathered throngs that dotted the street, careful that his longsword that hung by his side didn't jab anyone. Using his woolen cloak as a shield, he blocked stray liquids that sometimes strayed from a merchant's cart.    that would be more showing than telling. See the difference?  Also, another suggestion is to vary your sentences a lot. Most of your sentences are subject-verb-object. Read it out to yourself and you'll see that the pattern gets repetitive.  Lastly, stop rewriting if you want to finish. It's a hardest thing to do but that will be the biggest step towards getting a project done."
fantasywriters,3ddw6h,WovenMythsAuthor,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:56:07 2015 UTC,"Wow, thanks so much.  It's so hard for me to see this stuff until someone points it out.  I understand what you mean with the show don't tell.  Especially if it is Gareth's POV, I should be showing it from that perspective, right?  Like, how could he be looking at himself to know he was blending in seamlessly?  I'm totally guilty of a repetitive sentence structure as well, which is something I will work on.  I think I should move on to the next chapter, instead of fixing these things now in order to avoid my perpetual rewriting.  Is that what you would recommend?  I am new to this, so thanks for all the advice!"
fantasywriters,3ddw6h,WovenMythsAuthor,2,Fri Jul 17 22:12:08 2015 UTC,"Especially if it is Gareth's POV, I should be showing it from that perspective, right?   Well, this is true if you're using 1st person. You're using 3rd person so that gives you a little bit more leeway in that you can be a narrator as well. I wish I can better explain showing vs telling. Maybe someone here can. Okay, here's a try. Telling is the director of a movie telling an actor what to do, what's going on. Showing is what the actor does. So in your sentence, you were the director telling the audience what they're seeing. In mine, the character is the actor. I hope that helps.  And YES, a thousand times yes. Stop editing and go on. After you're done, you can go and edit because you'll know more of the story."
fantasywriters,3dcb54,Artemis_Aquarius,2,Wed Jul 15 03:52:31 2015 UTC,"nice. reads like a dresden files book. I was a little skeptical about one days tide would be so foreign that the mc doesnt even know about ant dragons and that a tavern full of people would shout him away... but by then I was getting a sense that there might be more to the mystery than I first thought. so id be willing to suspend my disbelief till I find out why so close is so far away.   id also recommend more sensory details. we get the trees are different here, but how? dresden files is set in present day chicago, so we can imagine it. we knkw the snells and sounds... but here we dont, especially when its presented as a new experience to the mc.  the voice was awesome. the ideas and quip were fun and endearing. as were the main characters urinary antics. it flowed well, it moved quickly. it wasnt confusing.  definitely an excellent start! id recommend it to my publisher.  edit: assuming the middle and end are as strong...."

I like the idea they didn't travel much so didn't know, especially Derek. I thought it could be a feature of this specific world. I'll see if I can hint at that more clearly. And, yes, definitely has more. Is an entire story, just didn't want to overwhelm people with the whole thing. I'll consider adding the rest.  Thanks so much for your time, really appreciate it. :)"
fantasywriters,3dcb54,neophytegod,2,Wed Jul 15 05:21:57 2015 UTC,my pleasure. and i liked it. ...i dont usually click excerpts and when i do i dont usually get very far... maybe im not the best team player...
fantasywriters,3dcb54,showmethebluprints,2,Wed Jul 15 06:02:46 2015 UTC,"The beginning was a little clunky for me - I didn't feel like the MC was really in much danger.  But once I found out the MC is out on his first time ""warrioring"" (I like that word), I began to connect with him more.  I am curious as to what the mission is - the mystery of it is a nice hook and would keep me reading.  When you are ready for punctuation and grammar proof-reading, I can try my hand at that.  I would like to read the end as well."

fantasywriters,3d6mr3,Seikah,5,Mon Jul 13 22:54:46 2015 UTC,"I think you might be best up parcelling the magic up into smaller chunks. Introduce a little bit of it; let the main character (and the reader) get used to it, and familiar with it. Then introduce the next bit. Rinse and repeat.  Also:   I've shown what I can, but I feel an 'education' chapter confirming what I've shown is necessary.   Why do you feel that chapter is necessary? Perhaps you should go back to showing how the magic works in the earlier bits, and make them feel more ... well, if you feel that an education chapter is necessary then maybe those earlier bits aren't doing their job."
fantasywriters,3d6mr3,h2g2_researcher,2,Mon Jul 13 23:08:36 2015 UTC,"That's what I've done so far: I've gradually shown the effects and limitations of magic, but that concerns only the output, magic as seen by a bystander, which one of my protagonists starts out as. The other end, the invisible input, that I can't show. As an unintuitive system, I'd break my own rules if magic could be learned through instinct, through feeling.   To offer a comparison, it would be as unrealistic as learning the Latin alphabet by hearing someone sing.   Edit: I might consider spacing it out, but that'd require repeated visits to a classroom setting. Considering the goal is the reader's understanding, I can't quite have the protagonist learn offscreen either. Thanks for the suggestion though!"
fantasywriters,3d6mr3,h2g2_researcher,2,Mon Jul 13 23:19:15 2015 UTC,"I might consider spacing it out, but that'd require repeated visits to a classroom setting.   Is there any reason they have to learn the inputs in a classroom setting? Vary the locations (and maybe vary the teachers too) and the situations.  When we're (the reader) learning a new bit about the input ask yourself: ""why do we have to know how to do this?""  That will avoid the problem of an infodump. As more is revealed about the inputs the more control and the more power, or the more options they will have available to them, right? (Right? If not ... how?!) So you can space out sections where the protagonist meets a task that they don't know how to solve, and then have them learn what ""inputs"" they need to get the desired effect.  That way every new bit of information feels like it has a point to it."
fantasywriters,3d6mr3,cefor,5,Mon Jul 13 23:58:45 2015 UTC,"Hey, so from the little you've explained here it sounds fun and I'd be up for reading about it if I were reading your book.  For an example of a published novel which did this, and quite well, assisted by diagrams and illustrations actually, is The Rithmatist by Brandon Sanderson.  In fact, Sanderson's other books, the Mistborn trilogy, were pretty good with this aspect too. They used a new system that hadn't been used before, was complex (in its way), but was also interesting to learn about.  But, give the reader information as and when they need it. Only if it would be detrimental for them to not know how something works should you really give them the bare bones rules.  Otherwise, I'd break up the rules and show them in a story meaningful manner. Say one rule is that you can't create food from nothing, have the character stuck without food for a day or so, boom, story meaningful reason to talk about the limitations on the magic system.  There is also the option of having a full blown info-dump in the appendix. It removes the need of having it ruin the flow of a story and has the added benefit of letting the readers peruse the rules if they need to.  If you think it's absolutely necessary for the reader to know the rules, then you will have to find a way to tell them which doesn't bore them."
fantasywriters,3d6mr3,actionlawyercomics,2,Mon Jul 13 23:27:42 2015 UTC,"I came in here to suggest Mistborn, but you beat me to it. Let's see, what else can I suggest? How about a prologue in another character's pov, where he is fighting with magic and loses because when he casts fireball, he adds an extra ""goto 10"" line? You see magic in action, how it works, and how it fails, all while  (hopefully) setting up the plot."
fantasywriters,3d6mr3,cefor,1 point,Sat Jul 18 13:52:31 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the recommendations! I'll borrow / reread some Sanderson books. I'd not heard of Rithmatist before.   Concerning my issue though, it's not so much the rules of magic I struggle with, it's the fundamental way magic is cast. It isn't quite thought-operated -- as a man-made process, it has tools, tools that no one understands well enough to make them convenient.    I've been spouting random analogies all day, so why stop now? Imagine giving someone who can't touch-type at all a keyboard without visible letters. Tell them to type a word. The keyboard explodes if they make a typo. It's kinda like that, yeah."
fantasywriters,3d6mr3,WELLinTHIShouse,2,Mon Jul 13 23:40:14 2015 UTC,"Well, that sounds exciting and would work in a story... as long as it wasn't a complete guide to casting magic in one info dump haha.  If it's the way it's cast, that constitutes character actions, so people will want to read about that. If they don't, they aren't the target reader anyway."
fantasywriters,3d6mr3,cefor,1 point,Mon Jul 13 23:50:35 2015 UTC,"I listed to The Rithmatist as an audiobook. I need to get my hands on a print copy, because that would certainly help fill in the blanks my imagination couldn't supply. :-)"
fantasywriters,3d6mr3,Useless,2,Tue Jul 14 00:33:22 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah, definitely. They were quite cute, really. There were actually pages between chapters which showed diagrams of the specific defensive and offensive marks the Rithmatists could use.  Very helpful for imagining the scenes!"
fantasywriters,3d6mr3,UncleTaco,4,Tue Jul 14 00:55:06 2015 UTC,"Have a magician royally fuck something up early as a sort of what-not-to-do, the results of either inexperience, lack of forethought, or overconfidence.  After all, if magic was easy, everyone would do it."
fantasywriters,3d6mr3,cefor,6,Mon Jul 13 23:31:34 2015 UTC,"Simple, but overlooked. Going to try this. (Although generally, my mages suck at basic magic so much, royally fucking up would still count as a success.)"
fantasywriters,3d6mr3,cefor,2,Mon Jul 13 23:44:53 2015 UTC,"think of it as a program written in three different languages, debugged in only two of them, in a world where user-friendliness isn't yet a thing.   Lets map a program to a spell as I understand it from your analogy: the spell is written in three different magical languages, the arcane focus or spell casting device can only really read two of those languages, but the third language ""compiles"" into one of the first two so the device might not catch errors coming from it. Am I in the ballpark? If so, read on.  With real life programs execution may be sloppy, but the theory underlying the task at hand is not. With real life programs you can ask the question ""can a Turing machine perform the task?"". If the answer is yes, more than likely so can the language you're using because a programming language is nothing more than a representation of a Turing equivalent machine. Or a subset of one. If the answer is no, then the language you're using can't perform the task. That's because a Turing machine can perform all computable tasks. If a Turing machine can't perform the task, then it is not computable as per the Church-Turing thesis.   If your spell crafting is analogous to program writing, then it may work to tell the audience about the theory of spell-crafting itself. It could be elegant in abstraction from real world implementation and inform the reader of exactly what the characters are trying to do when they try to cast a spell. That could potentially save you from a chapter long info-dump. You could then show the frustration your protagonist endures while trying to actually implement the theory.   I'd personally love to read about a character's struggles to learn something like what you're talking about."
fantasywriters,3d6mr3,Adrewmc,3,Mon Jul 13 23:39:12 2015 UTC,"I didn't mean my analogy quite so literally, but the system is certainly based on human logic, so it is on some level comparable.    If your spell crafting is analogous to program writing, then it may work to tell the audience about the theory of spell-crafting itself.    The theory is in fact what I'm trying to explain! I'm afraid it'll be unclear if I explain it succinctly though -- reader confusion is one of the more prevalent criticisms of my writing when it comes to magic. (Further complicated by the fact that even practiced magicians in my story don't entirely grasp what they're doing.)   I'd personally love to read about a character's struggles to learn something like what you're talking about.   Me too! It's why I'm writing it. It's reassuring I'm not the only one! :D (Having a ball with my characters' heartbreak when they realize how slipshod a system their idolized magic truly is.)"
fantasywriters,3d6mr3,Adrewmc,3,Tue Jul 14 00:01:59 2015 UTC,"If the mages don't understand the magic, then why is it necessary for the reader to?  I know I said this in my own comment, but if your reader doesn't need to know, then you don't have to tell them.  Perhaps some mystique surrounding the whole thing would be a good part of the book. Obviously, if beta readers are saying it's not very easy to read, then you need to sort that out, but perhaps you can reduce confusion by removing the explanations?  Something to consider, anyway."
fantasywriters,3d6mr3,InFearn0,1 point,Tue Jul 14 00:57:26 2015 UTC,They don't understand why they their specific actions cause magic -- but I do have to describe what those actions are. Most books simply go for focused thought and concentration but that doesn't fly here.

fantasywriters,3d78qe,bfaz39,3,Tue Jul 14 01:48:27 2015 UTC,"Overall Points  There are some really good things to say about this chapter, then some niggles.  I won't spend too long praising up the good, but the things I liked about it were:   solid, clear prose Well edited, lacks spelling/grammar/punctuation errors You open with an interesting situation that gets us into the heart of the story immediately. I knew at once this is a story about a sneak thief and that's really important. There is a sense of tension and threat to the character throughout You avoid including a cast of hundreds, letting us only see those that we need to see The character is doing something of interest and is the active participant, not just an observer You end the chapter with a cliffhanger   Ok, so on to the niggles!  You describe Amina as running past rows of shelves, but also that the shelves aren't paralell.  This seemed inconsistent, and it also stopped me for a moment, thinking ""Eh? The shelves aren't paralell? Why would they put them in any other manner?""   thin shafts of starlight   Stars (the sun excepted :P) don't really give off light sufficient to enter a room and see by.  The room would be pitch black if that's all the light coming in.   leaping across the gap and landing softly on two feet.   The two feet seemed like an oddity.  When you leap, you'd rarely land both feet together - was that what you were going for?   Her ear twitched   It's these little details that are bothering me and really stopping me from enjoying the tense situation and the interesting mystery that you've created. I want to read on and know what Amina is doing there, why her hands are cut, who's coming for her - but these little 'poetic licences' keep stopping me.  In this case, why would her ear twitched? Human ears do not have this response to sound, they don't move to adjust to it like a rabbit.  The starlight, the jumping, the rabbit ear - they keep kicking me out of the narrative because they can't be true.   There were two men below her   This can be assumed from the dialogue, it seemed erroneous.   “It’s now or never,” Amina said to herself.   Do people really do this?  Talk to themselves in this way?  I know that I don't, but maybe that's just me.  I was enjoying the build up of tension but this is a really cliched line, and I think it should go.  Are rabbits very rare in this world?  In England in the middle ages, rabbits were one of few wild animals that peasants would have permission to hunt and trap, so rabbit fur wouldn't be expensive. Rabbits are also plentiful and breed like... rabbits.  Going for a really expensive, rare fur - mink, weasel, polecat etc would suit the point better in my opinion.  Once out of the library, the blood on her hands is forgotten.  I'd like to know that she at least bound them up with a bandage or something because my mental image of Amina is a woman with bloody hands.  I didn't get the joke for a little while about mutually beneficial relationships and had to work it out.  There's no sexual innuendo there, but I assume that's what's being aimed at?  Ordinarily, the phrase has no sexual connotations at all.  Although this is a short piece, I didn't get much of Amina's personality coming across.  She's a thief. She knows magic.  She likes the finer things in life.  That's pretty much all I managed to get from her.  I'd recommend either giving her a couple of choice phrases - catchphrases, almost - that help show me a little more of her personality.  She's currently fitting into the femme fatale lady thief"" mould rather too accurately for my tastes.  I wasn't so sure about getting drugged and blacking out.  I feel like I've seen/read a lot of stories where characters get drugged and black out.  Is there any other way to put her into the situation without her having to drink drugged wine?  There's a certain Brandon Sanderson feel to your writing. Overall it was pretty enjoyable and I feel there's lots of positives to work from."
