LifeProTips,3duv5u,GravityWillNotHold,437,Sun Jul 19 18:25:50 2015 UTC,This is a good tip. I have tried this before and I recommend that people stick to water when they are crutching around. Unless you like really foamy beer.
LifeProTips,3duv5u,MarmadukeHammerhead,243,Sun Jul 19 19:08:39 2015 UTC,Clearly this is a time for luquor

LifeProTips,3duv5u,thebrokendoctor,85,Mon Jul 20 00:21:20 2015 UTC,Yeah but that's not moonshine that's speedboat varnish stripper
LifeProTips,3duv5u,BoomMichaelScoon,109,Mon Jul 20 00:24:48 2015 UTC,"Where I'm from, growler means something else. What does it mean here?"
LifeProTips,3duv5u,987414567412369,25,Mon Jul 20 01:16:23 2015 UTC,"Large glass bottle meant for transporting draft beer. Usually used as a means for craft beer takeout at bars or for storing homebrews. Usually 64 ounces but I've seem various sizes, 32 ounces, 1 liter, 128 ounces, and so on."
LifeProTips,3duv5u,Average_Emergency,11,Mon Jul 20 01:24:15 2015 UTC,"Thanks! TIL.  For reference in Britain, 'growler' is slang for a vagina"
LifeProTips,3duv5u,987414567412369,16,Mon Jul 20 01:34:45 2015 UTC,As an American I love British slang. Hopefully the love is reciprocated.

LifeProTips,3duv5u,Blackout75th,7,Mon Jul 20 02:14:57 2015 UTC,"So his mother clamchugged herself full of moonshine, then Ron drank it out to prevent the three women from fighting over him."
LifeProTips,3duv5u,regypt,12,Mon Jul 20 03:22:29 2015 UTC,Amazing.  Thank you.

LifeProTips,3duv5u,RinconDrone,3,Mon Jul 20 06:06:26 2015 UTC,Hm.
LifeProTips,3duv5u,Patternsonpatterns,2,Mon Jul 20 02:08:06 2015 UTC,I am the liquor.
LifeProTips,3duv5u,Who_Is_Mike_Jones,2,Sun Jul 19 22:50:26 2015 UTC,As good a time as any.  Have you ever tried to hobble across a busy street in crutches before the light turned red? It's embarrassing. One needs some ethanol to have the will to carry on.
LifeProTips,3duv5u,MarmadukeHammerhead,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:59:00 2015 UTC,Filthy luquor.
LifeProTips,3duv5u,thecactusman17,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:12:25 2015 UTC,One of my fraternity brothers shattered his ankle and while on crutches would remove the handle to put a ring of the plastic 6 pack holder thingys on the handle and just carry his beer like that.
LifeProTips,3duv5u,bootstraps_bootstrap,4,Mon Jul 20 01:06:08 2015 UTC,"Interesting idea, but I just wore my backpack a lot when I was on crutches. I also still wore pants, so phone and keys could stay in their regular home"
LifeProTips,3duv5u,Duuhh_LightSwitch,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:31:16 2015 UTC,"I wear a backpack too, but it saves a lot of time if its hot out and your ""walking"" and want a sip of water."
