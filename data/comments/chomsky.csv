The account comes in, makes a strong, sensationalist rhetorical statement and leaves. When any 'facts' are provided they are either blatantly false, bending the truth, or very selective, as can be seen here:   https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/3atut9/new_pentagon_manual_declares_journalists_can_be/csg9l9k  https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/3dpn6l/iran_lauds_indian_assistance_during_period_of/ct86duj  https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/3dfx1r/cuba_is_prepared_to_break_with_the_contentious/ct5jigm  https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/3djqaj/retired_general_drones_create_more_terrorists/ct7aycj  The things this account posts:   Support for TPP, TTIP and attacks on those who are against. Apologetics for any US crimes or actions of state terrorism. Denouncing of non pro-Western establish media (democracynow, rt) and praising/supporting CNN etc. Denying there is a large amount of poverty and homelessness in the US. Denying the US applies any pressure on its 'allies'. Attacking Snowden and supporting NSA spying programs.   etc.  That being said, I have my doubts about whether this is a professional propaganda account because I would expect those to be more subtle."

So there's no moral equivalence.   The problem was Harris and the interviewer were disputing the claim of equivalency under the pretense that those certain U.S. action were comparatively better(which isn't to say they were justified), so for Chomsky to respond that there was no moral equivalence because those actions were actually ""worse"" was just utterly pedantic and beside the point(that's why the interviewer kept finding himself saying ""but..."").

chomsky,3dhea5,Bleuski,2,Thu Jul 16 22:49:32 2015 UTC,"Harris works under the thesis that all moral evaluations are ultimately concerned with the well-being of conscious creatures. What Harris means by some societies having different degrees of ""moral wealth"" is that, for example, some societies accept throwing acid in women's faces, and that this, by all objective standards(though maybe not some religious standards), is not as conducive towards any standards of well-being that can be empirically established.  That being said, Harris is basically arguing from the position that a direct intent to murder innocents is generally more harmful towards well-being than a more benign intent that just happens to kill innocents. On those grounds, Harris contends that there is no reasonable standard by which Chomsky can suggest that Al-Shifa was a more immoral act than 9/11."

Either I'm still missing the point :), or that argument is unfounded.   Harris is basically arguing from the position that a direct intent to murder innocents is generally more harmful towards well-being than a more benign intent that just happens to kill innocents.    So Harris argues that it is morally more beneficial for a society to have State actors or anyone from that society kill innocents by accident rather than intent. The only problem with that theory is that that's all it is, the examples Chomsky uses are not without intent, the US government knew of the consequences of bombing a pharmaceutical plant in Sudan. Come to think of it, it's even a terrible argument for mistakes, as if killing thousands by mistake is any better than by intent, the results is the same on the devastated populations. The problem with Harris' argument is that Chomsky was talking about a geo-political issues, while Harris is trying to stay strictly within the narrow confine of theory.

Either I'm still missing the point :), or that argument is unfounded.   That was just an example. Take the systematic denial of education for women, oppression of homosexuals, whatever you want. The point is that there is a reasonably objective measure for saying that some societies have less ""moral wealth"" than others.

Harris is not justifying U.S. actions, he is simply saying that they are better in comparison. If you go back and read the original exchange, he illustrates the differences with his perfect weapon analogy. If the U.S. has a weapon that would only destroy exactly what they wanted, there would likely only be a few deaths. If an Islamist group with the goal of killing as many apostates as possible had such a weapon, the destruction would be catastrophic in comparison. Citing U.S. power and influence in order to compare it's morality to terrorist groups is apples and oranges."

Harris wasn't particularly concerned with what the actual intentions were in this case, or any other specific case(He even assumed Chomsky's perception of the actual intentions for sake of argument). Rather, it was just the basis for him to question Chomsky's general moral philosophy, in which he was willing to say that the sorts of intentions behind Al-Shifa were ""arguably worse"" than those behind 9/11. Chomsky simply did not substantiate his position beyond that.  Also, to address your edit, please read my post again. The full sentence, with the numbers removed: ""Harris' core contention was with the perceived equating of 9/11 and Al-Shifa, and from there he went on to speculate that, in order to be able to make such a comparison, Chomsky wasn't taking intentions into account.""

chomsky,3dhea5,buttdevourer,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:29:33 2015 UTC,"(1)the perceived equating of 9/11 and Al-Shifa   I think Chomsky wasn't interested in saying which was morally worse on the whole because it's almost completely subjective and can easily be taken out of context later.  If he says 9/11 is worse, then it looks like he's contradicting his previous statements.  If he says Al-Shifa is morally worse, then it looks like he doesn't care about the 9/11 victims.  So instead Chomsky tried to bring up specific objective measurements which can be verified: (1) the body count was likely higher in Al-Shifa, (2) the relative economic damage in Al-Shifa was higher (while the absolute economic damage was higher in 9/11), (3) the intentions are difficult to judge because we don't actually know what the intentions of the US leaders were at the time, but we can make some guesses.  So for Chomsky, before you say ""moral equivalence"", you have to explain what aspect of morality you are looking at, and how do you measure it.  If you just say one action is ""morally worse"" than another without giving specific reasons, then you are just making an appeal to emotions and instinct, and it's very easy to be swayed by propaganda.   (2)Chomsky wasn't taking intentions into account   I think Chomsky made it pretty clear that he did consider intentions, but it's very difficult to know what the real intentions were because politicians tend to lie.  What we do know is that in the Al-Shifa case, there was information easily available about what the consequences would be, so the US leaders making the decisions either didn't care about the consequences, or were willfully ignorant, or were completely incompetent (less likely)."

So instead Chomsky tried to bring up specific objective measurements which can be verified: (1) the body count was likely higher in Al-Shifa, (2) the relative economic damage in Al-Shifa was higher (while the absolute economic damage was higher in 9/11), (3) the intentions are difficult to judge because we don't actually know what the intentions of the US leaders were at the time, but we can make some guesses.   That's exactly how he's setting himself up though. By saying that the numbers are ""worse,"" what is he saying other than that...the numbers are worse? Nobody's denying those. He is implicitly making a moral evaluation based on the body count, which is precisely what Harris is accusing him of doing. Dismissing the factoring in of intentions because we can't be sure of them would be consistent with him claiming to not making moral assessments, but again, what is he even talking about then?   So for Chomsky, before you say ""moral equivalence"", you have to explain what aspect of morality you are looking at, and how do you measure it. If you just say one action is ""morally worse"" than another without giving specific reasons, then you are just making an appeal to emotions and instinct, and it's very easy to be swayed by propaganda.   That's precisely what Harris was trying to get at throughout the entire conversation, but Chomsky didn't seem at all interested in making himself clear. Harris original contention involved Chomsky citing of ‚Äúbody count‚Äù as a moral measure, but Chomsky made no effort to justify that as any sort of valid method. Chomsky also claimed that he took intentions into consideration, but again, made no effort to justify how he put them into a moral framework despite there being clear disagreement.   I think Chomsky made it pretty clear that he did consider intentions, but it's very difficult to know what the real intentions were because politicians tend to lie. What we do know is that in the Al-Shifa case, there was information easily available about what the consequences would be, so the US leaders making the decisions either didn't care about the consequences, or were willfully ignorant, or were completely incompetent (less likely).   Sure, Chomsky claimed that he did, and implicitly that he did so in a way that made sense, but Harris' point was that even if  he assumed Chomsky's view of what the intentions probably were for the sake of argument, he still didn't see any of those possibilities as being morally worse that a direct intention to murder innocents. That Chomsky might've technically taken intentions into consideration but did so in a way that Harris disagreed with wouldn't have changed the thrust of Harris' argument at all, which is why Chomsky's response came off as entirely pedantic."
chomsky,3dhea5,ppcnt,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:09:40 2015 UTC,"Noam Chomsky addressed (1), to cite him, ""I did not suggest that they were ‚Äúmorally equivalent‚Äù and in fact indicated quite the opposite"". He described 9/11 as a ""horrendous crime"" carried out with ""wickedness and awesome cruelty"". If there was a moral equivalency, then there should be an equivalent moral description of the Al-Shifa incident - there was not.  Therefore, the only logical conclusion we can reach, is that Harris considers the Al-Shifa attack as a ""horrendous crime"" carried out with ""wickedness and awesome cruelty"". This is of course, a necessity if he is serious about his claim of moral equivalency. From this it follows that, if he agrees with Chomsky's moral description of 9/11, then he must consider them to be morally equivalent.  There are other aspects of ""moral equivalence"" that can be mentioned, but I don't think it's necessary.   As for (2), Chomsky raised some ""very basic questions"", such as seriousness, all ignored by Harris. There was also another interesting issue of Japanese and German intentions, that is, historical examples of professed ""humanitarian interventions"" in Sudenteland and East-Asia. Succinctly put, Harris contention is that U.S propaganda has moral significance because we are ""good"". Though honest, this isn't novel in history, and needs no further comment."

To repeat myself, there is no moral equivalency between the U.S and Al-Quaeda. To even consider it, is quite astonishing.   ... so questioning stated intentions was a moot point.

Business power is very far from benign and it‚Äôs completely unaccountable. It‚Äôs a totalitarian system that has an enormous effect on our lives. It‚Äôs also the main reason why the government isn‚Äôt benign.  There‚Äôs a feeling in the country that people are under attack. I think they‚Äôre misidentifying the source of the attack, but they do feel under attack. The government is the only power structure that‚Äôs even partially accountable to the population, so naturally the business sectors want to make that the enemy ‚Äì not the corporate system, which is totally unaccountable. After decades of intensive business propaganda, people feel that the government is some kind of enemy and that they have to defend themselves from it. It‚Äôs not that that doesn‚Äôt have its justifications. The government is authoritarian and commonly hostile to much of the population. But it‚Äôs partially influenceable ‚Äì and potentially very influenceable ‚Äì by the general population.   .  I leave it up to you, whether you have the intellectual self-defense to understand these things or whether you will continue believing Koch funded shill getting rich by inciting rage against democracy is a good guy who deserves respect."

I'm no fan of Greenwald, I don't consider him a journalist. But I think it's fairly obvious how closely his and Chomsky's views align.   The quote you provided seems just as conspiratorial as anything Greenwald has said on surveillance. Both these guys endlessly talk about shifty, mysterious systems or cabals of people that secretly manipulate world events to satisfy their own evil desires.   And if not Greenwald - Aslan, Werleman, Hedges et al, all seem to plug the same moral relativism that underpins this narrative of the US being the worlds leading terrorist/surveillance state."

But, if they (for example Russia) does it, then it is a violation and shall be treated as such (as in sanctions).

Of those who said the U.S. is a threat, 31 percent are worried about the possibility of an American invasion and occupation of Russia.   That is obviously quite different from the 1 in 3 claim in the title.  At best, it could be construed as a 1 in 5.  Even that is a great stretch.  This isn't very good journalism.  The piece misconstrues its evidence in an attempt to convince Americans that WW3 is just over the horizon, and that ordinary Russians are worrying about a US invasion.  Well, why does Vox want us to believe that so badly?  It obviously isn't because it's true - if that were so, they would have cited evidence that actually supported their claims."

The series originated in 1963 as Mister Rogers on CBC Television, and was later debuted in 1966 as Mister Rogers' Neighborhood on the regional Eastern Educational Network (EEN, a forerunner of today's American Public Television), followed by its US network debut on February 19, 1968, and it aired on NET and its successor, PBS, until August 31, 2001. The series is aimed primarily at preschool ages 2 to 5, but has been stated by PBS as ""appropriate for all ages"".  Mister Rogers' Neighborhood was produced by Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, public broadcaster WQED and Rogers' non-profit production company Family Communications, Inc.; previously known as Small World Enterprises prior to 1971, the company was renamed The Fred Rogers Company after Rogers' death.

Not implying you always have to agree with Noam but why don't you Glennbots go make an r/Greenwald and post your pro-racist shit there?  Citizens United isn't just about money corp donations, btw.   You're literally on a Noam Chomsky forum advocating on behalf of the Koch brothers.  I know it's cliche to say but the 1st amendment was adopted by slave owners in the process one of the largest genocide / ethnic cleansing in history.

chomsky,3beaef,Chomskie,5,Mon Jun 29 15:03:14 2015 UTC,"Bush's decision to invade Iraq   In his Patriot book he admits this himself (while alluding to a certain political apathy at the time as I well I guess), saying he loved his country and trusted the president's judgement. Later when he started blogging he wrote a piece ridiculing an article detailing how the global opinion about America has fallen under Bush II. It includes the following quotes:  ""If people around the world believe that the U.S. has shed its values and has become a dangerous threat to the world...completely besides the point, if not downright irrelevant, when it comes to debating what measures the U.S. ought to pursue and is justified in pursuing in order to defend its national security and protect its national interests.""  Thinking otherwise ""is corrupt and dangerous"".  ""That America faces real dangers in the world is beyond dispute for rational people"" - Chomsky often claims the people of the U.S. haven't been in danger since 1812, apart from say 9/11, which was a direct response to our own violence abroad that Glenn is defending here. Chomsky must be irrational, then.  ""Brazil is now a full-fledged, healthy free market democracy which makes it a natural U.S. ally in South America""  Hahaha. Yes, U.S.A. LOVES democracy in Latin America!!!  Motivation of any non-American who is critical of U.S. foreign policy is ""their desire to promote the interests of their country is the engine""  ""The U.S. can and should pursue whatever measures it deems appropriate to protect its national interests.""  ""when asked who the biggest threat is to world peace...Brazilians will now almost always point to the Bush-led U.S. rather than to, say, Osama bin Laden, North Korea, or Iranian mullahs. While such trends may be upsetting to some, they cannot reasonably be used to argue that American foreign policy is misguided....Any nation would be acting foolishly, and self-destructively, if it allowed its foreign policy to be guided by the threat perceptions of people in other countries. When it comes to facing the profound threat posed to American interests by Islamic extremism, it is naturally the case that people in other countries will view the danger posed by that threat as being less serious and important than Americans perceive it to be.""  And of course there is this infamous post. The entire post is ridiculing an anti-Bush anti-war demonstration. So... yeah.   campaigns for racist Libertarians   If you follow his Twitter feed, say since the formation of First Look Media, he's been on a constant campaign to bury Hillary Clinton. Which is fine on the surface and I certainly agree with many of the complaints about her centrism. But when you compare it to his defense and promotion of the likes of Ted Cruz and Rand Paul and how he's never critical of say Koch favorite Scott Walker, it's clear what his agenda is. (I think Glenn made a couple of tweets back in 2011 critical of Walker coming out against gay marriage - since then not a word. While in that time he's probably made 1000s of tweets blasting Hillary.) Same with Paul. Maybe one or two tweets where he objects to something horrendous but 99% of his tweets about Paul are positive and promoting him. That has to be unacceptable to actual leftists.  Here on Democracy Now:  ""GLENN GREENWALD: Right, so there‚Äôs basically three factions in the Congress. One is the Rand Paul-led faction that says that this new law, the USA FREEDOM Act, doesn‚Äôt go far enough in limiting the NSA and that in some cases it actually strengthens the NSA, which is a classic Washington tactic, to call something a reform when it in reality is strengthening the institution to be reformed. Then you have this other faction, the right-wing kind of neocons in the Republican Party, the national security hawks, who say, ""We don‚Äôt want any reform at all of the NSA, and therefore we‚Äôre opposed to the USA FREEDOM Act, because we don‚Äôt think anything should be reformed."" And then you have the big bipartisan coalition in the middle, that includes the Obama White House, that says, ""We like this new law, the USA FREEDOM Act. We think it provides just enough reform to limit some of the abuses of the NSA, while at the same time keeping the NSA strong and vibrant.""  This plays into the most important factor of the Propaganda Model - Selection of Topics. What has Greenwald insisted is the most important issue in the world the past two years? NSA surveillance.   Human beings with souls believe the most important issues are poverty/income inequality and climate change. But you don't get to say nice things about Rand Fucking Paul when you talk about poverty and climate change. So he NEVER talks about those things. Neither does he ever bring up reproductive rights, gun control, the racism of the Tea Party, predatory lending, the list goes on. NSA - the U.S. spy agency - spying on people is all that matters. Never mind that Google can legally and does do more spying than the NSA could ever dream of - we'll never mention that.   But that Rand Paul is pretty cool, isn't he?   and who never criticizes corporate power - instead only ever attacking democratic power   http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2015/02/ken-silverstein-the-intercept-115586.html   And working for an internet billionaire is hardly reactionary in itself   Which is perhaps why it was part of a larger sentence which also included the above quote. You're right, Chomsky did work for MIT when the US military was very interested in linguistics for use in translation and code breaking in their genocidal wars in SE Asia and Latin America. Just because it's Chomsky does not erase this. But there is a difference between someone teaching linguistics and someone being paid to be a pro-business propagandist.  I've written a lot about this here and elsewhere. The Koch magazine Reason even stated, quite openly, the propaganda strategy of focusing on issues that overlap with the left in order to sway the ""disillusioned"" kids toward right-wing libertarianism."

There is no doubting that he has dedicated his career to checking the power of the state, which is the most admirable thing a journalist can do. Of course Chomsky will have no successor in terms of overall quality, because people just usually aren't that smart, clever, and able to memorize the seemingly endless amount of information that Chomsky has - but issuing a blanket condemnation on Greenwald is just plain old irrational - he has done so much good in his reporting, who cares about a blog about Argentina 10 years ago."

The same spammer who posts all the Greenwald articles here also posted an article by Justin Raimond that had nothing to do with Noam Chomsky. Who is Raimond? He's an fanatical Ayn Rand fan who once wrote an article about how clueless Noam Chomsky is. One would hope there would be no need to moderate against such postings on a Chomsky forum but it was upvoted more than Chomsky's most recent article was.  Whoever runs this subreddit can certainly do it however they want but unless you do moderate against pro-business propaganda - which Greenwald and Raimond most certainly are - it will dominate. I am all for banning any Greenwald content that is not directly related to Chomsky. Unfortunately it's not up to me and we have a site where Ayn Rand nuts are featured ahead of Chomsky.   has dedicated his career to checking the power of the state, which is the most admirable thing a journalist can do   No, it 100% is not. To quote NOAM CHOMSKY   At the deepest level, the media contribute to the sense that the government is the enemy, and they suppress the sources of real power in the society, which lie in the totalitarian institutions ‚Äì the corporations, now international in scale ‚Äì that control the economy and much of our social life. In fact, the corporations set the conditions within which the government operates, and control it to a large extent.  The picture presented in the media is constant, day after day. People simply have no awareness of the system of power under which they‚Äôre suffering. As a result ‚Äì as intended ‚Äì they turn their attention against the government.  Business power is very far from benign and it‚Äôs completely unaccountable. It‚Äôs a totalitarian system that has an enormous effect on our lives. It‚Äôs also the main reason why the government isn‚Äôt benign.  The government is the only power structure that‚Äôs even partially accountable to the population, so naturally the business sectors want to make that the enemy ‚Äì not the corporate system, which is totally unaccountable. After decades of intensive business propaganda, people feel that the government is some kind of enemy and that they have to defend themselves from it. It‚Äôs not that that doesn‚Äôt have its justifications. The government is authoritarian and commonly hostile to much of the population. But it‚Äôs partially influenceable ‚Äì and potentially very influenceable ‚Äì by the general population.   The ""power of the state"" as you put is also sometimes called democracy. You're lauding him for ""dedicating his career"" to checking the population's power against private corporate tyranny - and he's gotten extremely rich and famous doing this. Did his heroic dissidence prevent him from going to the Academy awards, or his nationwide book tour?   but issuing a blanket condemnation on Greenwald is just plain old irrational   I've been studying this for over two years using Herman and Chomsky's propaganda model. I've posted 1,000 of words about this here over the past week and that old blog post has been like 1% of what I've had to say.  By implying that was all I have to say on the matter is nothing short of a lie - which, coincidentally, is all Greenwald supporters ever seem to do. And yes, that may well be a blanket statement but again one that is supported by careful study and much evidence.  In an interview once Greenwald said the reason he is better than Chomsky is he doesn't drone ""on and on"". He says he doesn't allow himself to be marginalized like Chomsky. You know how he accomplishes that trick? He avoids saying anything that the powers that be would object to. Billionaires don't object to advocating for smaller governments with less power over billionaires. They often pay people, like Glenn, to say such things. So great trick - never threaten the real power of oppression and amazingly he isn't marginalized. Ridiculous.   PS - Thanks for your permission to be able to disagree with Greenwald that Latin America's economy is a result of the poor national character, as the racist Greenwald says."
chomsky,3beaef,comix_corp,3,Mon Jun 29 19:43:06 2015 UTC,"The Chomsky article your quoting is referring to a separate ""power of the state."" There, he's talking about how the media obscures the word and gives people hopelessness about ever affecting it because it is one evil entity, ""the government."" That's a narrow definition for the purpose that he was trying to accomplish there. But I was referring to actual state power, that is, the practice of state power, which Glenn has played a great role in deteriorating and placing into check.  No - Glenn is not marginalized because he can't be. He has the leaked documents, he has the golden goose. Before he met Edward Snowden, he was a nobody, and yes, marginalized. They need him now as a source of extremely important documents. Snowden didn't pick him out of a raffle hat, he choose purposefully.

Google does more spying than the NSA. Google, unlike the NSA, can access your private communications without a warrant legally. Google knows every website you visit. Google know what you do on every website you visit. Insurance companies are going to start offering lower rates if you install Google's thermostat. Google knows everywhere you go.  The old ""corporations can't arrest you"" is meaningless because, hey, we actually want criminals to go to jail. What we don't want is the most powerful corporation having access to every conceivable piece of data available about you - down to your current heart rate - which they then sell to anyone who can pay.  What you said about Chomsky makes no sense. There's nothing narrow about what he said. He specifically chose words which are not narrow so that I could point that out to liars who want to claim otherwise.

chomsky,3beaef,Chomskie,1 point,Mon Jun 29 23:58:13 2015 UTC,"That article was written ten years ago. You don't think he could've changed his opinion?   You specifically asked me for a citation. Should I not have given it? The point is - again - IF he had changed his mind one would have to assume he would therefor reject Koch funded propaganda outfits like Reason magazine and would reject the propaganda of Koch-owned assets like Radley Balko. Not only does he not reject the propaganda of the the biggest contributors of climate change denial he still constantly promotes them.  Again, YOU asked for the fucking citation. Sorry I was able to give you one - but I didn't write it.   Moreover, making tweets vaguely supportive of aspects of one candidate is not the same as campaigning for them.   I disagree 100%. Again using the Propaganda Model - by selecting topics he can praise Paul and he's able to sucker young people, who would normally lean left, into supporting racist libertarians. As I've said this strategy was literally spelled out in the pages of the Koch's Reason magazine.   And I don't accept your dismissive ""tweets vaguely supportive"" comment. The propaganda model was developed prior to social media. You know how journalists ""internalize the values"" of the media owners and those who do make it through the ""filter"" to become featured in corporate news? In social media users don't do this for money or career advancement (some, like Adam Johnson, certainly do) but rather they do this for Retweets and Followers. It's a significant aspect of Glenn's pro-business libertarian propaganda.   He gladly promotes avowed right-wing racist journalists like Radley Balko while his lying piece of shit Glennbots smear, slander, sexually harass actual leftist journalists. On Twitter his most ardent supporters - the so-called Glennbots - spend all day sexually harassing transgender leftists. I'm not making that up. These are people Glenn retweets and interacts with often. If you're an actual leftist on Twitter Glenn Greenwald's biggest fans will target you for sustained sexual harassment - and he encourages these people and promotes their accounts.   He's said much nicer things about Bernie Sanders.   He has made some positive tweets about Sanders. But it's like 10% of the amount he's made about Paul. In no way were they ""nicer"" much less ""much nicer"". Again people he promotes like Adam Johnson have come out to say they can't support Sanders because when Bernie loses the nomination all his support will be sucked up by Hillary.   Again, people who aren't pro-business Libertarians can say nice things about Bernie Sanders without saying 10 nice things about Rand Paul.   I see nothing wrong with the DN quote. Do you disagree that Rand Paul said that about the act?   I've already explained it's about selection of topics. After the murders in South Carolina Greenwald felt the biggest aspect of the story was the definition of a word. Not the open racism of Libertarians like the Paul, and in fact the entire Libertarian movement.  I'm sure you could find things that Bill O'Reilly has said where technically true. If you dedicate yourself to only ever talking about those things you could give someone the impression O'Reilly isn't so bad.  Again, you asked for a citation. I've already explained the significance of the Propaganda Model's selection of topics (offensive I have to do that on a Chomsky forum). You're either incapable of understanding or you, like all other Glennbots, are just willfully deceitfully.   Focusing on one issue does not impact the importance of others. This has absolutely nothing to do with the selection of topics as part of the Chomsky/Herman model.   This simply makes no sense. Chomsky has been a world famous anti-authoritarian since Glenn was in diapers. But there's a reason for every time he mentions the NSA he mentions private corporate power and income inequality 10 times. With Greenwald it's the exact opposite. When you add to the fact that Greenwald's favorite Libertarian billionaires are the main force in climate change denial - something Chomsky has been claiming for years will most likely end human civilization - and Glenn chooses to never talk about climate change is supremely significant.   You want to pretend otherwise I certainly can't stop you - all I can do is point out your lies. But unless you are literally being paid by Glenn or the Kochs to do this I have to assume you're mentally ill. And that's not an insult. That's 100% serious.   Again, the fact that he's writing for a news outlet run by a megamillionare does not mean he's a paid shill.   You're right - it doesn't. It's what he writes that shows this.  10 years ago he was a raving neocon blogger. Then he worked for the Koch's Cato institute for a year and probably met right-wing libertarians like Radley Balko. Balko used to teach right-wing journalists how to get the Koch's message across. The Koch's Reason details the methods of swaying the ""disillusioned left"" toward neoliberal candidates and policies. Over time Greenwald is suddenly a Left hero - yet he never cuts ties with Reason, and racist Balko, and never talks about climate change, abortion, gun control, the bigoted Tea Party, etc.  THAT, and much more, is what indicates he's a paid shill.     Calling him a shill is a serious claim and you've shown no evidence for it.   All I've done is provide evidence. You demanded citations like some intellectual invalid. That my replies were commonly known shows you're ignorant going in. I provided ample citations for each request. For you to say that's not good enough exposes you as a clown. I answered your questions. I didn't say that's the end of it. I could give you a lot more. As I say I've been writing about this - using the Propaganda Model, which is insanely reliable - for years. I provide clear evidence and all the relevant citations.   All you do lie. ""Give me a citation."" Here's a citation. ""That doesn't prove anything!"" Then why the fuck did you ask for it? Just to run fucking flak for the Koch-backed propagandist. You can't make valid points, all you can do is say; it doesn't mean anything. It does.  The fact you try to paint me as someone with no evidence or significant study to back up my claims is comical. See here. For more this is the post that proceeded that one."

And for that I thank you.  Here is Greenwald publicly criticizing corporate influence on C SPAN:   ...you look across the government and what you see is the financial industry... poring money into the campaign coffers of members of congress... each and every policy [promulgated under the Bush and Obama presidency in response to the financial crisis] has as the prime beneficiaries the financial elites who fund them and who control them and to whom they are inextricably linked...it's a form of extreme corruption in general."
chomsky,3beaef,aromero,1 point,Tue Jun 30 07:51:26 2015 UTC,"That was 2009. It wasn't actually controversial to say the banks are bad in the spring of 2009. In fact even the most extreme right-wing Tea Party members were saying that. In 2005 he was defending Bush and the Iraq War. By 2006 when Bush's approval rating was down to 30 Glenn started to blog about how maybe this George W. guy isn't so good.  Since 2013 Glenn has worked for Pierre Omidyar. People, like myself, questioned whether The Intercept would report only on the government, something that would benefit neoliberal billionaires.  This is not insignificant. Pierre Omidyar, through is Omidyar Network, has funded regime change in India and Ukraine to implant more business-friendly (meaning hostile to the actual people who live in those countries) governments. In Ukraine he did this working with CIA-front USAID.  The method Omidyar Network uses is via funding propaganda which highlights or exposes government ""corruption"". (It's ironic that the first thing Greenwald says in your clip is about government corruption.)  If you see that tweet I linked above, Glenn's response to it (the reply wasn't to me, whom he ignored) he called my question a ""false claim"". But I hadn't made a claim. I had made a prediction - one based on Herman and Chomsky's Propaganda Model.  Several months later Omidyar's First Look Media hired Matt Taibbi - known for his great work on the finance industry. This hire was pointed to as proof that FLM wasn't intended to work as Omidyar's projects in India and Ukraine were - that is: propaganda to promote a neoliberal agenda.  Greenwald himself seemed to mock me personally when Taibbi was hired. And so we waited. Kept an eye on The Intercept. They never criticized tech companies for-profit spying. They only ever attacked the government. They never wrote about banks or corporations. But we waited for Matt Taibbi to prove Omidyar, and Greenwald, weren't frauds.  It's not simply that Taibbi was fired without ever publishing a word at FLM. What's significant is that he clearly produced a story about corruption at JP Morgan while he was at FLM - meaning Omidyar Network paid for that story. It was finished when he was fired because he published it in Rolling Stone a couple of days later - complete with a whistle blower and everything!  What's worse is the crime Greenwald and Scahill and the repulsively sleazy John Cook committed when they trashed Taibbi who was clearly under a non-disclosure agreement (possibly agreed to as part of a deal that would allow him to publish the story he had produced while working at FLM) and therefor couldn't defend himself from their shameless innuendo. Everything Greenwald claimed then, as before, was shown to be lies by later revelations, like the expose by Ken Silverstein.   A few months after Taibbi was prevented by the Omidyar Network run First Look Media from publishing a story about JP Morgan it was announced they had entered into a partnership with JP Morgan. No one blames you for not actually noticing this since you couldn't see as your eyes were full of tears over Snowden's heroism.  So what does Taibbi have to do with Greenwald?  Nothing! Which makes Glenn and Jeremy's disgusting tabloid hit piece on Taibbi so unforgivable.   I don't think you could ever find an example of something like that ever occurring between journalists. It's quite clear WHY Glenn and his then-editor Cook wrote that. Because they know they're paid shills. People who aren't paid shills don't think that way. They stand up and defend their colleague. They don't tamp the dirt down over their coffin.  It's funny how I cite a blog post from 2006 and Glennbots fall over themselves suggesting he's changed his mind. Then they turn around and cite a 6 year old comment - the least controversial thing you could have said in 2009 - as though it's the ultimate proof.   Specifically about Glenn's comment - that's why his defense of the Citizens United ruling is so offensive and unforgivable.  .  But so anyway - back to my predication about The Intercept using the Propaganda Model. I was 100% right. And Greenwald lied about this. He smeared me claiming I'd made a ""false claim"" - I hadn't, I had expressed a concern brought about by my understanding of the Propaganda Model. And his army of trolls have continued to lie about and smear me to this day.  But, as always, the Propaganda Model was right. And he's a corrupt shill."

Astonishingly, the students (""cadets""), really do listen and think about his presentation.  In short, remember we have (at least in the U.S.), this idea that there are some wars that are ""Just Wars"", such as WWII, vs. other wars that are not so, such as Vietnam.  Under this thinking, it is claimed, that the role of military leadership is to help only with wars that are ""Just"".  ...And it turns out that there's quite a sizable body of literature out there talking about so-called good wars & bad wars, etc.  In this talk, Chomsky reviews a lot of these works, which presumably the students are studying, and basically shows that pretty much the whole concept of a Just War is a bunch of baloney.  ...In fact, I don't know of any other talk from any other person that more completely blows this whole concept away.  The highlight of this video is the Q&A when the students ask about this, and I kept thinking they weren't going to pay attention or they would shut things down.  ...But, right there in West Point, you get one of the more fascinating philosophical discussions you'll hear.  ...Classic Chomsky:  Sounds so plain and goes through all the facts & details almost enough to put you to sleep, but actually it's just outright incredible and ground-breaking."

chomsky,3b3by2,Chomskie,-1,Fri Jun 26 07:08:13 2015 UTC,"Selection of topics is the most important factor in Herman and Chomsky's propaganda model.  You don't like ""Mass surveillance""? Have you noticed that Saint Glenn has never written about Google's for-profit surveillance? Google, Facebook, Microsoft, etc. have it in their terms of use that they can legally read your private correspondence (emails, chats, PMs) WITHOUT a warrant. And they in fact do - Microsoft doing just that to a French blogger's emails - they read them without a warrant - and had someone arrested due to the contents. Add to this the frightening move for facial and voice recognition tech - by the private sector. As you (and most everyone else) praise Glenn's neoliberal assault on government regulation the for-profit surveillance industry has tightened its stranglehold on humanity.  There's a reason Glenn has waged a 2 year long propaganda campaign about something everyone knew about already. $$$. If he ranted about Google and Facebook the way he does about our democratically elected government he wouldn't be getting rich working for an internet billionaire.  As I wrote here a few days ago I know the people who found Dylann Roof's manifesto on Twitter. The guy once tweeted that he feels Radley Balko is a good ""strategic ally"" to the left. Well, Roof could have cited Balko's reporting on the George Zimmerman trial (when it's a civilian shooting a black youth Balko defends them) as being behind his murderous rage. Balko advocates that private colleges should be allowed to discriminate against blacks and also happens to believe there should be no public colleges. These people are NOT strategic allies.  I've written extensively about this. Reason magazine, a Koch funded extreme right wing racist mag which Greenwald recommends every day, once detailed how to sway the ""disillusioned left"" toward pro-business (which Greenwald certainly is) libertarianism - what they advised doing is exactly what you just said is good about Greenwald.  All I can say it keep these things in mind. Selection of topics IS the propaganda model."

chomsky,3b3by2,Chomskie,-4,Fri Jun 26 08:44:35 2015 UTC,"The other day The Intercept ran an article about Google refusing to carry an app that blocked Google's tracking in their app store. At first glance it would seem they are being adversarial to corporate power. But you need to understand the broader context - as Chomsky warns.  You'll notice that in the U.S. there is no call to regulate for-profit surveillance. Why should their be? These companies, like Google, have become THE biggest lobbyists in Washington. Do you know how easy it would be to pass laws saying Facebook can't legally track what pages on the internet outside of Facebook you visit simply because they put a cookie on your device? There is no call for this type of regulation - especially from Greenwald. Why is that kind of spying okay? It's not, he's being paid to sway the public against taking these actions by convincing them their own government is the enemy.  Now about the story at the Intercept - the app company is filing a complaint in Europe (because no one cares in the U.S.) saying Google is violating anti-trust or whatever. The reason this doesn't counter The Intercept's pro-business / neoliberal propaganda is because the app is a technical solution to something very simple regulations (re: laws) could address. That's what right-wing libertarians don't want (Chomsky, a left-wing libertarians does want this - at least in today's world, he acknowledges it's needed to counter concentrated private power).  There is irony here as the anti-tracking app needs to turn to the government to battle Google's monopoly power. If, as right-wing libertarians want, there was no government regulation and everything was left up to the free market, the app would have no recourse. And Google could simply bury the app, not only in its store but it's more important search results all it wanted - with no fear of anti-trust action from the public's democratic power.  Again, everything that app can do we could do by passing laws saying you can't do this shit anymore, assholes. Greenwald / The Intercept never mention this. As horrible as the New York Times is you'll occasionally find this stuff discussed. Rare, but there are no rules against it. At the Intercept Jeremy Schahill once threatened to quit because someone was publishing something that wasn't portraying the government in a negative light. The reporting was accurate, just neither he, nor Greenwald nor their billionaire boss, want to ever publish ANYTHING that isn't portraying our democratic power as the only enemy."

It's real big and took me a few months to read (it's not the size itself, but the depth of the material, the amount it 'opens your eyes', that you need to give time to settle in).  The great thing about it is that it's well edited transcripts of him answer questions and in interviews throughout the late 80's‚Äî90's. It covers a vast amount of ground, and is very conversational in its tone. You get that great Chomsky lecture, but you can read it about 5 times faster than it takes him to draw it out as you'll notice in recordings of his lectures. He is not the most inspirational speaker.  This book really was an education, and has completely changed the way I look at world affairs and media.  http://www.amazon.co.uk/Understanding-Power-Indispensable-Chomsky-Noam/dp/0099466066/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1435160941&sr=8-1&keywords=indispensable+chomsky"

chomsky,3ay7il,Azsu,8,Thu Jun 25 08:16:53 2015 UTC,"There are two types of Chomsky books, roughly, and both types are worth reading:   Large-scale, detailed accounts of American atrocities: these books are quite dense, though very good for an overview of the facts Chomsky repeatedly cites. I would read any of the books he wrote with Ed Herman. Manufacturing Consent would be a very good start.  Abstract political commentary: these books are good for a review of the moral and philosophical underpinnings of Chomsky's political thought. I recommend For Reasons of State and On Anarchism as places to start. The lecture ""Language and Freedom"" is particularly good.    Also, if you're not averse to audio recordings, I highly recommend his lecture ""Government in the Future"", which you can find on YouTube."

chomsky,3ay7il,wamsachel,2,Wed Jun 24 15:44:02 2015 UTC,"I would start with his website.  Also, check out his various talks/lectures on YouTube.  A few films have been made about him, a few you'll be able to find in the documentary section of this site. 'Rebel Without a Pause' is fantastic. There's also the Michel Gondry animation/biopic/documentary 'Is the Man who is Tall Happy', there's much more focus on philosophy than politics, though. When I recommend his work to friends, the films have really helped humanise him, which is important if you find his criticism of the west uncomfortable at first. 'The Essential Chomsky' is excellent as it covers the framework of his thought on nearly everything (the chapter on Vietnam blew my mind).  I would also highly recommend 'How the World Works', this is a compilation of various talks he has done around the world, edited for concision. Because it's based on talks, the prose is less weighty and you can be a 'chomskyite' after a couple of nights reading.  Enjoy! And you should know, he's actually extremely witty and funny at times, this was something I was not told. He's portrayed as a curmudgeon by the western media, I actually think he writes with surprising levity given the frustration he must regularly experience.  Edit: I done spell bad."

It's portions of his writings concerning the Catalonian anarchists, US politics, anarchist critiques of Marxism, language and freedom, the Enlightenment, and broader anarchist theory. It's a tough read if you're not familiar with anarchism (you might want to read up on the writings of Mikhail Bakunin, Rudolph Rocker, anarchist and Marxist intersections, and Revolutionary Catalonia), but if you can get through it, you can read practically any of his political/social related books. I only recommend it if you want a challenge though. If you're interested in On Anarchism, you might want to read Peter Marshall's ""Demanding the Impossible: A History of Anarchism"" and ""Anarcho-Syndicalism: Theory and Practice"" to get a little bit of a head start so you're not drowning in the content.   Profit Over People, on the other hand, is an easy book for sliding into the kind of content he covers and the style in which he writes and speaks, ranging from free trade agreements, resistance, US domestic and foreign policy, and some interesting sections on capitalism as a whole. It's his most accessible. If you want an easy read that's not too frustrating, this is your place to begin. It does not entirely modern, and the fact that it was written in the 90's makes some of the info on NAFTA and other events prior to it's publication makes it almost readable as history."

The recent billionaire who publicly said he feared the public rising up with pitchforks is a classic example of rich capitalists fearing the mass of people who are not capitalists. So who can the rich count on to defend them and their capitalist system?  The ruling class does not want to smear or demonize those right-wing nuts because one day they may be seeking them out as allies, perhaps even putting them into power to protect the rich.  We see the US government doing this all across the world to bolster capitalism in countries threatened with socialism and populist democracy, for example, the way the US used fascists in Chile after our 1973 coup there, or the way the US uses right-wing paramilitaries/death squads all over the world.

Take this exchange from the TV show The West Wing in their first aired episode after the 9/11 attacks:  BOY 1   What was the first act of terrorism?   TOBY   [to Josh] What was the first act of terrorism?   JOSH   I could answer, but I think he's asking you, man.   TOBY   [sighs] I-I know it's not new. I know in the eleventh century... I'm gonna have trouble pronouncing this, in the eleventh century, [sighs] secret followers of Al-hassan Ibn-al-Sabbah, who were taught to believe in nothing and dare all, carried out these very swift and very treacherous murders of fellow Muslims, and they did it in the state of religious ecstasy.   .  That's rather shocking, but also a fairly common attitude. I mean the idea that no one ever engaged in political violence prior to the eleventh century? No one, especially one of the most popular television writers of this century, could be that mistaken (or stupid). He wrote that because to him, that's what the word means - a Muslim who blows things up or kills people for Islam.  I'm not saying he's right.

Do we have any evidence supporting the existence of this thought-process? To me it seems more plausible that right-wing extremists are ignored simply because there isn't much for the media to gain by reporting on them (other than, you know, journalistic integrity).

chomsky,3aj6oa,Chomskie,-1,Mon Jun 22 16:45:13 2015 UTC,"When examining the media using the Propaganda Model the most important factors are: who is paying for the news - the incentive for journalists (and editors) to internalize the values of those paying - selection of topics. The first two are internal mechanisms, the last is the end result. It's what we see.  An example from my own work is the recent story about China's (supposed) hacking of Federal databases. I wrote about a similar story over two years ago. In one week the NY Times ran a dozen articles about this report that came out claiming much the same thing about China. This was shortly before the Snowden leaks. When I wrote about this I noted that China had released a statement in response to the story claiming that their state websites were attacked hundreds of thousand times per month, with most of the attacks coming from the U.S.. As we would learn when the leaks came out the U.S. does indeed do this (as I also noted they were pretty open about it and no leaks were needed to tell us this). Yet among the dozen stories and over 10,000 words in the week I analyzed the Times coverage, they did not report about China's statement.  That's the significance of ""selection of topics"". Again, a stark example considering what we now know. When you say you can't see any right-wing propaganda at The Intercept I must assume you are not considering this all important aspect of Herman's Propaganda Model. But I must assume, as I no longer read The Intercept - even to add to my already damning applications of the model to it - because it's just too upsetting for me.  Last month someone posted a link to an article hosted on Antiwar.com. The article was written by Justin Raimond and it did not mention Noam Chomsky. Justin Raimond is a Libertarian. That's Libertarian in the American / Ayn Rand sense of the word.   Well what‚Äôs called libertarian in the United States, which is a special U. S. phenomenon, it doesn‚Äôt really exist anywhere else ‚Äî a little bit in England ‚Äî permits a very high level of authority and domination but in the hands of private power:  So private power should be unleashed to do whatever it likes. The assumption is that by some kind of magic, concentrated private power will lead to a more free and just society. That kind of libertarianism, in my view, in the current world, is just a call for some of the worst kinds of tyranny, namely unaccountable private tyranny. - Noam Chomsky   You don't have to agree with Chomsky about that. But if you don't that's pretty much all you need to know. If you are promoting this American libertarianism by promoting the likes of Ron and Rand Paul - which Greenwald does, you are very much promoting a right-wing ideology. As, indeed, the Pauls run as Republicans.  Back to Justin Raimond, who a few days ago was unironically asking people to petition the White House to put Ayn Rand on the $10 bill, he once published an article titled: MANUFACTURING DISSENT - Noam Chomsky: He's really an interventionist ‚Äì and also completely clueless. Not only was his more recent article that had nothing personally to do with Chomsky posted to /r/Chomsky but it was upvoted, with 80% voters recommending the article.  Now, you may well agree with that article (I did not read it). You may well agree with something Rush Limbaugh or Alex Jones says. I don't think that means people should be submitting their works to /r/Chomsky however - and I hope you agree on that. Selection of topics allows the worst elements in our system to appear to be allies to Leftists. This was detailed rather openly in the pages of a magazine Glenn Greenwald often promotes, the Koch's Reason magazine, when an Israeli Libertarian politician called for the ethnic cleansing of Gaza. Greenwald's beloved Reason offered this advice on how he could counter the backlash:   Feiglin‚Äôs hard-line views might be an easier sell in the eyes of the skeptical Israeli left when accompanied with emphasis on freedoms such as privacy, voluntary military service, and legalized marijuana. His libertarianism on economics and social issues puts him at odds with the Israeli mainstream, but might also add to his appeal to the disillusioned left, still in search of its post-Oslo identity.   Why would Reason defend and offer advice to someone like this? Because, as I say, Reason (like the Cato Institute - also endlessly promoted and lauded by Greenwald) is funded by the Koch brothers. They do not do this because they love freedom but because they love money. It's a front. It's a sham. It's a fraud. Sharing their love of ""free markets"" trumps being in favor of ethnic cleansing.  If you examine Greenwald's output, both in what he has written at The Intercept and his social media account on Twitter, you will find he adheres to Reason's advice for appealing to the disillusioned left perfectly. And again, when you say ""The Intercept is hardly right-wing for an American political site"" I cannot agree seeing as I adhere to Chomsky's assessment of American libertarianism. As bad as the New York Times can be they often report things critical of corporations that you will NEVER see discussed by Greenwald or published by The Intercept.  When you say ""show me some articles"" I ask you to look for references to the likes of libertarian Radley Balko, to Reason magazine, and to the Cato Institute in their reporting. Chomsky has written quite a bit about civil liberties over the years but he manages to do it without promoting right-wing libertarians.  Go through the past two years of Greenwald's Tweets and count how often he is critical of Hillary Clinton (who hasn't even held an office) compared to tweets about extreme right-wing libertarian Rand Paul. I'll bet that at least 90% of Glenn's mentions / links regarding Paul are favorable, while 100% of mentions / links about Hillary are negative.  ""Well Glenn is mostly writing about something Paul agrees with, so that stands to reason""? That is why selection of topics is so vital to understanding the propaganda model. Actual human beings with souls feel inequality and corporate domination of our lives (and ironically of the internet specifically) is far more important than the fact with have a government which has defense and intelligence agencies. But if you never mention these things it makes it easier to con the disillusioned left, as the Reason article advises.*  John McCain (whom libertarians voted for 3 to 1 over Obama in 2008) is constantly criticizing Obama for not being aggressive enough in places like Syria and Ukraine. Does Glenn Greenwald ever mention this? McCain is backed by the all-powerful Chamber of Commerce and often the Obama administration is engaged in legal battles against these corporate interests on our behalf. Is this ever mentioned? And I'm far from an Obama supporter (as I'm sure few at /r/Chomsky are) but if you only attack Obama and never the extreme right he is fighting with you are right-wing.  I have written a lot about this myself. After The Intercept reached 100,000 words published I counted the words to examine their selection of topics. No surprise 1 out of every 100 words mentioned law enforcement - all of it critical, while they only had a handful of mentions regarding tech companies like Google, Facebook, Apple, etc. None of their mentions of these tech companies were critical of their for-profit surveillance which goes far beyond what the NSA can do (email services owned by the likes of Google, Yahoo, and Microsoft have a legal right to read your emails - not just scan, which they do do and have had people arrested for illegal content - but actually open and be read by an employee of these companies - Microsoft once having someone arrested by reading a blogger's email). These aren't concerns for the anti-state, (U.S.) libertarian The Intercept. No surprise since they are wholly owned by internet billionaire Pierre Omidyar.  There were no mentions about gun control, abortion, austerity, or any left cause that doesn't happen to overlap with Ron Paul style libertarianism. Glenn singles about Elizabeth Warren for supporting Israel - not that she doesn't deserve criticism for that - but when all 100 Senators have exactly the same stance it's telling that he targets her specifically. (Recent hiring of Lee Fang was a positive but hey, Glenn had already done his work leading up to the disastrous midterm elections so an attempt to try reestablish their left cred is to be expected over the next year or so - until the real push against Democrats once again picks up)  Greenwald supporters online who favor themselves to be extreme leftists mock those of us who are critical of the Koch brothers, Reason magazine, and racists like Ron and Rand Paul. That's how total his manipulation has been. The silence from independent journalists about this is stunning - all hoping to be hired by Greenwald and start receiving paychecks from the billionaire. (I would like to write more about this but this reply will be long enough without it)  Again, I've written about this a lot. But rather than link you to my stuff I'd just ask you consider that quote from Reason magazine and understand that selection of topics isn't always about the New York Times ignoring China's claim the U.S. is spying on them. More often than not it's about not writing about the corporate interests paying the journalists and editors."

chomsky,3aj6oa,Propertronix6,1 point,Tue Jun 23 05:02:33 2015 UTC,I hear you but Glenn seems principled though. I think your biggest gripe with him is that he is an American libertarian. He is a consistent critic of Israel. The fact that he said something nice about someone's economics who happens to want to ethnically cleanse Gaza doesn't mean he supports that persons view on Gaza.
chomsky,3aj6oa,Chomskie,0,Tue Jun 23 06:13:36 2015 UTC,"Lastly, regarding this submission we are talking in. Greenwald not only actively promotes racists like the Pauls but also defends the likes of Ted Cruz. Again, not that Ted Cruz can't say something you agree with but it's selection of topics. People like Radly Balko try to portray themselves as champions of African Americans because of their anti-police writing. But when Zimmerman shot a black teen he defended Zimmerman. It's not about defending blacks, it's about attacking the state, like a good right-wing libertarian (which Balko openly admits he is) should. On issues like poverty and inequality, state protections against discrimination, social services - most importantly education, Balko takes positions that harm blacks considerably. But through selection of topics he has managed to con many on the left to thinking he is an ally.  That last link is to a tweet from the man who found Dylann Roof's manifesto online. Ironic since said manifesto all but mentioned Balko's reporting on (defending) Zimmerman in his murder trial. So go on, keep defending racist libertarians who only support leftist policy that happens to overlap with Ron Paul-style libertarians while not only ignoring the real causes of our oppression but actively providing flak against anyone who does. And so he, and The Intercept's new minor league affiliate FAIR, selected this topic to write about. And not the fact that the leader of the conservative group that Roof claimed caused him to murder 9 blacks in a church donated to the campaigns of Rand Paul and Ted Cruz."
chomsky,3aj6oa,Chomskie,0,Tue Jun 23 05:02:40 2015 UTC,".* I think it's at least worth noting that Glenn Greenwald was an unabashed neocon when he first started blogging. Later he worked for the Koch's Cato Institute and surely began to mingle with that crowd. So did Glenn really do a 180 in his political views? Or was he instructed by the likes of Balko on how to better influence those disillusioned leftists - again, using selection of topics like those advised by the extreme right-wing Reason magazine? This is worth thinking about, I feel."
chomsky,3aj6oa,ijvsld,-1,Tue Jun 23 05:17:43 2015 UTC,"I did't know that, but you already said it. I don't think Greenwald himself wrote anything about the Roof case.  You are too hostile, especially with people on /r/chomsky. I happen to agree with most of the things you say, but the way you say some things leads many people to misunderstand you or dismiss your opinion.  There is definitely a large amount of varying opinions, biased media coverage, and misinformation being poured out which can confuse and distract people that in general agree with Chomsky into supporting right-libertarianism, Marxist-Leninism, and the like. You have to understand that most people here aren't experts and are in the process of learning.  Also, just because people may have differing opinion does not mean they are your enemy. There is a lot of variation among socialist and anarchist thought - dividing up and being hostile to one another only benefits the elite."
chomsky,3aj6oa,spock84,-4,Mon Jun 22 15:34:49 2015 UTC,"Personally, and I'm of course pulling this straight out of my ass, but to me this guy seems borderline retarded, or that he at least has some serious mental issues. I think we are often very correct in such assessments, and that the real problem here is that we are too careful or too prejudiced to make such assessments about, say, islamists. As for ""persons unknown"", everyone in the west has been force-fed with the threat of islamic terrorism, so we just assume that's what it is whenever someone goes on a rampage. A murderous rampage isn't necessarily an act of terrorism."
chomsky,3aj6oa,armin199,2,Sat Jun 20 22:55:15 2015 UTC,"Why are you assuming he must have ""some serious mental issues""? Is he too white to conduct a terrorist attack consciously?"

I don't even know where to begin if I were to respond to that last question of yours, but I'll abstain, because it's an obviously prejudiced thing to say to someone, especially someone you don't know.  All I'm saying is that he really, really looks like someone who isn't fully there, and I'm even admitting up front that I'm guessing (just with a different choice of words). It's just a hunch. And there's of course also the fact that he very likely acted alone in attacking a random group of people that he hated, which is something we've seen quite a bit of from people with his type of background, and many of them have proven to suffer from mental illness.  That wasn't even the point I was making.."
chomsky,3aj6oa,armin199,5,Sun Jun 21 02:31:52 2015 UTC,"""it's just a hunch. And there's of course also the fact that he very likely acted alone in attacking a random group of people that he hated"".  that paragraph captures my point exactly.   The fact that you think he's either a lone-wolf or mentally ill or not ideologically driven is because it's deeply rooted in your unconsciousness that white people can't commit systemic acts of terrorism, and thus you look for alternate explanations.  Btw if you still think he's a lone-wolf, read:   http://america.aljazeera.com/articles/2015/6/20/website-features-racist-manifesto-photos-of-charleston-shooting-suspect.html  Edit: Also:  http://fusion.net/story/153144/why-doesnt-south-carolina-have-a-hate-crime-law-given-its-past/  ""there are 19 Racist Groups actively Operating in South Carolina"", but you're right he's a mental lone wolf /s"
chomsky,3aj6oa,spock84,-1,Sun Jun 21 03:02:23 2015 UTC,"No, again you're being prejudiced and assuming at least just as much as I do. I strongly believe that a lot of those that carry out such acts in the name of islam (or other typically ""non-white"" causes) may very well be mentally ill too. Being brainwashed by religion, to the point that you're so delusional that you think killing innocent people and yourself is morally right and good, is in itself a form of mental illness - it's just too sensitive a topic for anyone in the field of psychology to suggest or do research on.  Again, that wasn't even my actual point in the first post. My point was, again, that we're deliberately conditioned into assuming that any shocking act of violence is most likely terrorism."
chomsky,3aj6oa,Propertronix6,2,Sun Jun 21 11:20:05 2015 UTC,"Except he specifically decided to attack black people in a historically important black church associated with the civil rights movement, similar to church attacks on black people for a long time.

Since its founding The Intercept has done nothing but attack the ""state"" while promoting business interests (often specifically praising Apple / Microsoft).

In fact, the corporations set the conditions within which the government operates, and control it to a large extent.  The picture presented in the media is constant, day after day. People simply have no awareness of the system of power under which they‚Äôre suffering. As a result ‚Äì as intended ‚Äì they turn their attention against the government.  Business power is very far from benign and it‚Äôs completely unaccountable. It‚Äôs a totalitarian system that has an enormous effect on our lives. It‚Äôs also the main reason why the government isn‚Äôt benign.  There‚Äôs a feeling in the country that people are under attack. I think they‚Äôre misidentifying the source of the attack, but they do feel under attack. The government is the only power structure that‚Äôs even partially accountable to the population, so naturally the business sectors want to make that the enemy ‚Äì not the corporate system, which is totally unaccountable. After decades of intensive business propaganda, people feel that the government is some kind of enemy and that they have to defend themselves from it. It‚Äôs not that that doesn‚Äôt have its justifications. The government is authoritarian and commonly hostile to much of the population.

For instance he often points out that Martin Luther King survived the Civil Rights movement. He wasn't assassinated until he had moved onto the Poor People's Campaign. There it met with the racism and class domination of the North and was quickly crushed.  In the same way Libertarianism is perfect for white middle-class and up. Not perfect if you actually want to change anything - like the economic oppression of Blacks in America - but perfect for feeling good about oneself on internet forums while not having to make any sacrifices yourself.

Now I get a lot of guff from the left for how critical I am of Greenwald - but the fucker openly defended Citizens United - and has never backed off that defense.  Plain and simple we already had a political system dominated by rich / corporate interests. Greenwald the lawyer didn't feel they had enough control and advocates that corporations aren't just people but Super People - as they are immortal and not bound by citizenship as us mere mortals are.  What I mean is people like Radley Balko, so beloved by the fake Left, writing about police oppression while at the same time advocating nothing change economically - unless it's change that favors business interests. The average black in America owns 6 cents of wealth to every dollar the average white in America owns. No matter how many articles one writes / reads about police brutality NOTHING is going to change for blacks without some form of wealth redistribution - even if just in the form of expanded social services / more funding for education and health / minimum wage raises.  There are trillions and trillions of dollars sitting in off shore tax shelters. When I said sacrifice in that context basically that could simply me some Alex P. Keaton not wanting to sacrifice his chance at maybe owning 50 billion dollars in personal wealth some day. I don't mean people who don't have very much giving up what little they have.

I've studied his twitter feed (laugh at that if you want but the Propaganda Model was developed prior to social media but it does apply just as snugly as it does to print media) and since he was hired by Omidyar I'd say he makes 100 tweets critical of democrats to every one he makes of republicans.

Add to that he's written over 100 books, changed the face of linguistics, certainly could collect enormous sums of money in speaking fees.  Hillary's speaking fee is $225K.  I wonder if in fact he has charged speaking fees when he's dealing with sponsors that can afford it and he's given it all away.  The fact that he has so little at this point suggests that he has given much away.  A common rule of finance is that you can withdraw 4% of your assets annually in retirement and this ensures that it will last.  Chomsky lives in Boston, an expensive area.  Probably owns his home, so that's a good chunk of his net worth.  Maybe some other assets.  Assume $1.5 million is capital.  That means he lives on $60K a year.  That's a decent life if your house is paid off, but not extravagent."

I actually have relative that most here have never heard of that gets speaking fees in the $3K range very often.  He's a union organizer and uses the money to fund his efforts and also put food on the table I suppose.  If Chomsky had chosen he could have been a person that had a net worth in the hundreds of millions in my opinion.  He must decline a lot of speaking fees or give a lot away."
chomsky,39pwpv,fifteencat,10,Sat Jun 13 17:57:02 2015 UTC,"First of all, I don't think this question should be prematurely downvoted as it raises an interesting point.   Yes, Chomsky could give most of his money away. He could also forgo all use of fossil fuels or leave his emeritus position at MIT to work in a soup kitchen in Falloujah. It is very easy to point out how a privileged person, like Chomsky, could abandon his normal life to live a more saintly one. Many of the readers of this subreddit, including myself, could probably give more to charity, spend more time protesting, etc. But, I believe this misses the point.   Each of us strikes a balance between our normal lives and our activist lives every day. Chomsky is no different, except for the fact that he is a towering figure of science, philosophy and political commentary. His life as a successful academic has indeed brought him great wealth, though his wealth pales in comparison to that of America's super-wealthy. However, I for one think that his  role as a leading left activist and tireless hero for the rights of working people and the oppressed balances his relative affluence.   Others, even Chomsky, may disagree. After all, he was famous in the 1960s for including himself among the ""weak and miserable men"" who didn't do more to temper America's terrorist war in Indochina. He even said he ""hated himself"" for not doing more. Also, Chomsky is the first to admit that he is really nothing more than a voice. The real power of left activism is in just those people who lack Chomsky's wealth: the poor, the marginalized, the oppressed. Chomsky admires these people, though he does not join their ranks per se. Bertrand Russell was a similar case.   I'd be interested to hear others' thoughts on this issue."

It doesn't give you any perspective; a rate of return over a 50 yr period could vary from 20% to 2% for example, giving vastly different figures."
chomsky,39pwpv,peteav,6,Mon Jun 15 08:47:35 2015 UTC,"Two million net worth isn't that much. If anything it's surprisingly low given Chomsky's fame and the volume of his books/appearances. Net worth isn't cash in the bank, that includes his retirement savings & investments, the value of his house (which could have easily appreciated a lot given his age), etc.  I think Chomsky understands we are dealing with systemic problems, and his meager earnings aren't going to make much difference in solving the problems he talks about. I won't speak for him, but personally I think activism is way more important than donating to charities. In a properly functioning society charity would be unnecessary.

Now, defending an academics right to interpret history, an academic that was sentenced to prison time for his opinion is very different to defending /r/fph's ""right"" to a hate circle-jerk on Reddit. I'm sure you understand that Reddit is within their rights to censor anything they want and a users real power is to leave the website, since that's what you're suggesting. I'm perfectly fine staying on a board which is actively censoring something as worthless as /r/fph even if they weren't leaking into other boards and shitting them up.  This is all assuming that it's suppressing an opinion just because they don't like it. I'm actually fairly satisfied in the explanation that /r/fph was imposing negatively on other boards, brigading and harassing.

Greenwald had some sort of confrontation with a mod.  Seems like this sort of stuff is just going to happen sometimes. What does a mod have to gain by banning him? Even if the mod had some political motivation there's obviously nothing to gain and so much to lose by censoring.

Read what Chomsky says about what is considered Libertarianism in America today. It's the worst possible thing there is.   Greenwald is a Libertarian propagandist. Not Libertarian Socialist as Chomsky might claim to be but a Cato Institute / Reason Magazine Koch funded American Libertarian.  It's 100% Anti-Chomsky. It's violently against everything the man stands for. It's oppression by the ruling class.  BTW I'm pretty used to people who spam American Libertarian propaganda not understanding my criticisms of them. Because you have no argument.

He has to admit it's not but then he, Chomsky, is effusive in his praise and tries to more than backtrack any perceived slight of Glenn.   The business world is also quite willing to tolerate exporsure of governments intervening in personal life and business life in a way that they don't like, as they don't want a powerful and intrusive state. That's not to criticise The Guardian and The Post for providing an outlet for the Snowden / Greenwald material...   I believe Google has become the largest lobbyist in the U.S.. Tech companies like they and Apple and platforms like Facebook don't need anything from the government. The people invented computer tech / communications and the internet - thanks - but it's all ours now. And just day after day a tech billionaire pays Greenwald to advocate against Democratic control of the web.

One who has used his assets in a similar fashion places like India and Ukraine to sway the democratic process in favor of his business interests. All Greenwald reports on is NSA data collection - never mentioning tech corporations data collection for profit.  You can add the 3rd filter, sourcing, into evidence of this obvious fact as well, as Snowden leaked confidential information about the government, not say Google's data collection for profit. Snowden, like Greenwald, is a right-wing Libertarian (this is Chomsky's own distinction, as he says Libertarianism in the U.S. is unique - Ron and Rand Paul are the most dedicated toward corporate power - these are candidates Snowden and Greenwald endorse. Racist, pro-corporate American Libertarians.)  If you don't understand the first 3 filters of the Propaganda Model maybe you should read up on it before asking me to explain it."

The same can't be said for Al-Qaeda, Saddam Hussein, and other tyrants.   I don't think you can take two for granted.   Perfect weapons would be the preference of both and used based on the same criteria: ""How would this serve my interests?"". We can test this with drone policy which is not all that far removed with exception of the bystander. Theoretically in his assumption, the tyrant would just have less people considered innocent bystander. Unless someone wants to claim that some of these tyrants would be happy to accidentally off someone they consider friendly.  So what is the best case scenario for Harris?  Something like:   Hold fair court hearings and invite the accused to defend themselves. The defendant is absolutely guilty of all accused crimes. The defendant does not show (for court) but embeds themselves into a populous area with devastating weapons.   With these criteria met I think we have a sufficient case to justify use of such a tool.  How does this compare to actual policy?   There are many examples of actual targets being hit who were never formally charged and never received a day in court. The evidence is often shaky and troops are used as pawns in local tribal conflicts where they are actively being deceived. Many targets were not participating in violence or were driven by violent crimes against them and previously they had never even left their immediate area.   I would prefer the US to have such a power of the two having to make a choice, but I can't approve of either.  You might even argue the bystander point if you are Vietnamese for example."

So just go to Democracy Now and check the headlines.  Why doesn't Bill O'Reilly talk about the same stories?  Fracking protests, forced schooling of indigenous people in Canada.  These are stories ordinary people might be interested in, but not what the rich want to see discussed.  So suppose you're an Amy Goodman or a Juan Gonzales.  You're an extremely intelligent hard working person that's produced content of interest to ordinary people, but you're not likely to get a promotion into a place like MSNBC.  As Phil Donahue and Cenk Uyger learned, it doesn't matter that you produce good ratings.  You need to not step on toes of the powerful.  Cenk was criticizing Obama a bit from the left.  Donahue was against the war, hosting the top rated show on the program, but that didn't matter, he was canned.  Goodman or Gonzales can still conceivably be interviewed by mainstream sources if their journalism produces a story of interest that an ordinary network wants to cover, but they won't make it far within any major network because they've demonstrated that they have not internalized the preferences of the rich.  Nobody has to tell Bill O'Reilly not to talk about COINTELPRO and the FBI's war on the Black Panther party.  He's truly an apologist of the rich.  He believes what he's saying.

I do however think that despite all the indirectness and systemic nature of effects, and despite the separation (and emotional detachment) of the owners (the ""1%"") from the results of their economic stewardship and preferred policies, these people who wield influence disproportionately and to the inclusion of others are thus able to get the government and media to service their interests, however indirectly.

Unless, like in the case of the NSA leaks, it's something corporate power wants. Then, as you hopefully see, they are powerless to stop them.  The 3rd filter, sourcing, is where the state does have some control. David Sanger of the New York Times is a perfect example of this. He is given great access to Dem White Houses (Clinton and Obama) and in return for this he never prints anything they don't want him to.  White House wanted to brag about Stuxnet so they gave Sanger the info and he wrote an entire chapter in a book about it. Just last week I saw something about the U.S. trying and failing to do something similar in North Korea. WH didn't want to advertise that so there was no scoop by Sanger. Sanger has a good career and he does get a lot of inside stuff but it's exactly and only what the WH wants reported.  And that's the most important factor. Journalists know that if they act like Thomas Friedman or Glenn Greenwald and do exactly what the powers that be want them to they'll win Pulitzer. If they don't and report what the powers that be don't want reported they'll end up like Gary Webb.  .  As far as COINTELPRO, I don't think that really became a story until people started winning court cases about it. And when compared to the much less significant story of Watergate it was more or less buried. I have no recollection of ever hearing about COINTELPRO until I got into Chomsky a few years ago. Obviously I knew ever detail about Watergate even though I didn't really care. As Chomsky says that's because half the political power in the U.S., the Democratic party, wanted the Watergate story told. Neither party wanted COINTELPRO reported and, relative to Watergate, it was basically buried."

Secondly, I don't think you need to engage in a comparative analysis to determine whether this is true or not. It seems rather obvious: if young people leave university with debt, they are likely to look for work, and then conform to our system, instead of, for example, becoming more politically active in their communities.

The citizens of America are unique in their consumerism culture and the market driven society in general. Its a natural conclusion, that in such a society; those in power will have more leverage to oppress than other countries. The war on terror is a good example of this. Look at the war mongering countries. The same argument flows. Why did the US illegally invade and murder innocent people?  Why is the US torturing people?  Spying on all citizens? It seems obvious that those in power in the US enjoy far greater power in their actions then in other countries such as Germany of Greece."

As a result, the degree I chose to get with zero fear of college debt?  Philosophy.  My yearly income is below the poverty line in the United States, but I've also managed to live on my own and by myself without a day job for over the past half a decade and counting, so the majority of my time is almost exclusively spent on deeply thinking about and investigating those topics I'm most interested in, and in working out."

We should do something about it.... o wait I cant, my debt is crushing me along side the cost of just living. I hope history remembers them for this greatest of crimes.

Many professors are temps now and living on food stamps to get by. Meanwhile, students are paying absurd tuition. Who gets rich? The boyz on top. Everybody else suffers, just like the average corporation."

However, this state of affairs would never have been possible without the willing & eager support of the boomer generation & their parents;  that much is certain. We know that that segment of the population has been heavily propagandized."
chomsky,384c96,myxopyxo,2,Tue Jun 2 02:17:09 2015 UTC,"the willing & eager support of the boomer generation & their parents   Unfortunately that's true. The average member of any generation doesn't do a lot of thinking, unless they have to (if circumstances are bad enough). It's the nature of the human race to be easily distracted by toys, and manipulated by fear.  But a lot of the real assholes of American politics were elected by narrow margins. All it takes is 51% of the numskull vote, and America is rife with numskulls. But what of those 49%, or even 20% who know what's going on and want to do the right thing? They are numerous and ignored."

chomsky,384c96,myxopyxo,2,Tue Jun 2 07:21:18 2015 UTC,"I think it's about a false sense of security and a bit of supply and demand. Everyone wants to go to college and are thus prepared to pay the hefty fees for it, and believe they'll be able to pay of the debt with the huge paychecks their future jobs will land them.  I actually have a problem with this side of Chomsky's theories, it's so often some kind of active conspiracy but I really don't believe it needs to be. For the most part I think the capitalist system is self-regulating and simply favors the top by it's very nature. Occasionally of course there is an actual conspiracy or conspiracy-like situation such as the bailout of huge banks and stuff.  It's a matter of occam's razor to me, you don't really need the conspiracy to explain this problem. It could serve to explain why it doesn't get regulated, but then again I think it's more a matter of strong lobby organisations than some active scheme by the bourgoise.  The effects are as he describes though, on that point I agree."

He isn't saying its a conspiracy (at least not in the way you're thinking) hes saying that the education-induced debt is beneficial to the elite. That's it. He's not saying they are explicitly secretly working to raise education prices. Chomsky is not a conspiracy theorist at all, most of his conclusions are based on the belief that the elites acting within the current system will naturally work against the benefit of the majority.   For the most part I think the capitalist system is self-regulating and simply favors the top by it's very nature.   This is a recurring idea in Chomsky's thinking. Of course calling a system where elites collude and form cooperative centers of power that act in their benefit a 'capitalist system' is an oxymoron."
chomsky,384c96,myxopyxo,3,Mon Jun 1 19:55:09 2015 UTC,"Hm, perhaps I'm misunderstanding him then. I don't think that's clear at all from what he's actually saying in much of his work.  For example I saw Manufacturing Consent recently and got about the same feeling as I described above, the feeling that he was making stuff a lot more complicated than it needed to be and put a face to a faceless problem. I'm with him on capital controlling the media, but it seemed like he was saying the capitalists were controlling the media in their favour. Especially when using words like propaganda which usually refers to attempts at deceiving the public (which I think he said too), while I personally believe that the effects he are describing is true but that it's almost completely unintentional.  I've seen other stuff by Chomsky where he talks more along these lines though, so I'm not exactly sure what to make of it. I've seen videos where he talks about the educational system for example making sure that people who aren't inline with the system never get anywhere - that's the more self-regulating model as opposed to magazines being literally owned by capitalists (which they of course are) and therefor running a capitalist agenda (which they also are, but not for that reason)."
chomsky,384c96,poopaloopar,2,Tue Jun 2 15:01:34 2015 UTC,"The elites do heavily influence and mostly control the media in their favor.

Chomsky rarely judges the motives behind action and tries not to assume anything, but saying these things are unintentional is just absurd.  Lying about events in Vietnam to justify war? - Unintentional?  Lying about events in Vietnam to garner public support for the war. - Unintentional?  Spreading massive propaganda to garner support for wars. - Unintentional?  Arresting and oppressing anti-war activists, 'reds', 'commies', 'reds'. - Unintentional?

Just call them 'elites'.   that's the more self-regulating model as opposed to magazines being literally owned by capitalists (which they of course are) and therefor running a capitalist agenda (which they also are, but not for that reason).   'Self regulating' in what way? Most important political and economic decisions are made by a small group of elites, and these decisions are not made unintentionally or by accident. Saying that making such decisions is beneficial for the elites in the system therefore the system is 'self regulating' because it keeps the powerful in power is really not saying anything at all (and these decisions are not made unintentionally at all), nor does it contradict what Chomsky says. In my opinion we can't just ignore the fact that a few people are oppressing and exploiting the vast majority and blame it on 'the system' alleviating the elites of the responsibility - 'the system' does nothing, people in 'the system' do things."

Lying about events in Vietnam to garner public support for the war. - Unintentional?  Spreading massive propaganda to garner support for wars. - Unintentional?  Explicitly filtering journalism in order to fit a certain agenda. - Unintentional?   Well, sort of yes. By unintentional I mean that I do think, for the most part, that the people who write this really believe what they write or it's just not economically viable for them to print the truth. This is where the self-regulation of the system comes into play, if they were not susceptible to believe those things they wouldn't be put into those positions to begin with.   Arresting and oppressing anti-war activists, 'reds', 'commies', 'reds'. - Unintentional?   That's not the role of the media though, but again I do believe the people who did that thought they were doing the right thing. At least originally.  This is sort of a gray area because in this case I do think there are some people who definitely know what they're doing is wrong and that they're doing it to retain power, but only at the top. Right below the top they've just put the right kind of people, the kind that will believe that it's the right and just thing to do.   Who are you referring to here? Just call them 'elites'.   Sure, elites work too. By capitalists I refer to people with lots of money and thus lots of power to manipulate and control.   'Self regulating' in what way? Most important political and economic decisions are made by a small group of elites, and these decisions are not made unintentionally or by accident.   Yes and no. Some of the decisions, such as those of central banks and pretty much all economic decisions are clearly run by the elites. But basically I'm against the idea because it makes it sound as if the whole system was designed top-down, which it wasn't. It's a collection of ideas that grew out organically and have been fit together because it works.  Take the image in this post for example, it says that college is expensive because it leads to a desirable outcome for the elite. Sure, it is. But it didn't become that way because of the elites, it just stays that way because of them. It could easily be mended with a few governmental decisions, but it's not because the outcome is favourable.  The reasons it became that way are manifold. The disciplinary techniques grew out of what was believed to be a good method of teaching, they stay because the outcomes are favorable. The loans grew out of wealthy people finding a way to make their money grow. The price of education grew out of people being willing to pay the price, and if you steadily increase the tuition fees people won't react to the growing trend. Or something like that.  All this combined gives a favorable outcome for the elites, and therefor they think it's a good system. I don't even believe that the mechanism described by Chomsky here is necessarily that well known to within the elite (some of them will have thought of it, no doubt).  This is a lot simpler than the picture I feel Chomsky is painting. It simply boils down to conservatism. For some decisions they may be thinking of the consequences, but for the most part they just don't wish to change a system that's doing them good. Thus, the precise mechanisms are unintentional."

If you actually read Manufacturing Consent then you would know that Chomsky presents several cases where elites, journalists, media outlets, politicians have purposefully lied while knowing they were lying, all with sources, citations, and evidence. Furthermore spreading propaganda because you believe it and spreading propaganda because it is beneficial to you are very different reasons the latter being 100% intentional.   That's not the role of the media though, but again I do believe the people who did that thought they were doing the right thing. At least originally.   Those 'commies', 'reds', 'anarchists', (notice that 'reds', 'commies', etc. are not what these people called themselves for the most part - these are classifications and names given to them by the propaganda system [including the mainstream media] in order to arouse public sentiment against them) were a part of the media, and they were systematically arrested, oppressed, killed because they had something to say that didn't benefit the elites. Originally this grew out of anti-war (pre-WW1) sentiment in the US and the Russian revolution was used as a tool to group anyone that wasn't supporting the state under the banner of dangerous radical 'commies' and 'reds' for the purposes of propaganda. How this is a good thing or how this was unintentional is beyond me.   But basically I'm against the idea because it makes it sound as if the whole system was designed top-down, which it wasn't. It's a collection of ideas that grew out organically and have been fit together because it works.   No, actually you are blatantly wrong here. The US system did not 'grow out organically because it works' in some democratic and free-spirited way. Not at all. The US system started as an extremely oppressive and exploitative class-based society where the vast majority of whites were in extreme poverty and lived in a serf-like condition, many without voting rights. Attempts to change the system (often by rebellious coalitions of whites and blacks) were met with violence and executions. From the late 17th century onwards, propaganda systems for the purposes of arise suspicion and contempt between blacks, whites (even between different groups of whites) and Indians were already in place mostly for the purpose of keeping the lower classes struggling with each other and paying less attention to the elites. The revolt of the mass of impoverished against the few elites was one of the biggest issues in the minds of the elites back then and a system to keep this from happening was developed since then. Read 'A People's History of the United States' for a detailed account of this.   Take the image in this post for example, it says that college is expensive because it leads to a desirable outcome for the elite.   No it does not say that, even though this may be the case. It says the indebted students are beneficial to the elites. Note: not 'it is so because...' but 'it is beneficial to...'.   But it didn't become that way because of the elites   What are you basing this on?   This is a lot simpler than the picture I feel Chomsky is painting.   Like already said, he did not say 'the elites did this because it benefits them'. It may be the case, but that is not what he said.   but for the most part they just don't wish to change a system   How is raising tuition not a change. That's a direct change."

The latter is intentional, yes. But that's not the whole picture is what I'm saying. And no I haven't read Manufacturing Consent yet, I'm sure it will tell me a lot more than the documentary.

How this is a good thing or how this was unintentional is beyond me.   I think I pretty clearly defined what was meant by unintentional in my last post. It's not that it's done by mistake, it's that it's done without an agenda. I.e. that the intention is not to uphold the system. I've also said that there are exceptions, to which this is probably one of them.  But even here there are gray areas. And good is very subjective, I wholly believe the majority of the people hunting down the reds believed they were saving people from tyranny - not that they were hunting the enemies of the elite to uphold their own opression (because the elite themselves didn't hunt, a big part of it is that they do very little themselves).   No, actually you are blatantly wrong here. The US system did not 'grow out organically because it works' in some democratic and free-spirited way. [...]   The US is bit of a special case here, I'm speaking mostly from a European perspective being European myself. But many parts of the US system did indeed grow organically in Europe before it split of in the US. But you're correct that much of the system was indeed constructed top down.   Read 'A People's History of the United States' for a detailed account of this.   I'll put it on my list, thanks.   No it does not say that, even though this may be the case. It says the indebted students are beneficial to the elites. Note: not 'it is so because...' but 'it is beneficial to...'.   Fair enough, so that's pretty much what I'm saying then. It stays because it's benificial to them, otherwise it would go.   What are you basing this on?   My reasoning above. It's like you're asking me why I don't believe flowers were invented by a creator, it's simply that the creator isn't needed. There's a much simpler explanation that doesn't require a creator.   How is raising tuition not a change. That's a direct change.   Not really. Prices of everything increase all the time based on what people are prepared to pay for goods and services. With tuition prices can rise faster because people are prepared to go into debt to pay for it. Note that I'm not talking about a free market, I don't think it's free in any way, but the part about rising prices for goods and services demonstrably works in this case.  I have a question. You earlier told me to be more specific and use elites instead of ""capitalists"", so I want you to be more specific. Who precisely is it that controls the US or the world according to you? What are their names? Do all super rich people take part in it, or just some of them? Is the president one of them? Is it a fixed set of people, or does it vary? How many are there?"

Who precisely is it that controls the US or the world according to you?   Mostly the elites who hold the majority of power and wealth. The general public also has a small say.   What are their names?   Bill Gates, Warren Buffet, Donald Trump are some.   Do all super rich people take part in it, or just some of them?   I don't know the case of every person, but I would say the vast majority of elites work intentionally to give themselves a bigger piece of the pie at the cost of others.   Is the president one of them?   Obama is, of course.   Is it a fixed set of people, or does it vary?   Varies.   How many are there?   Everybody has some economic and political power. But those at the top have exponentially more wealth and power than those at the bottom. The interests of elites sometimes also interfere with interests of other elites. I would guess 10% of the population hold 90% of the power in the US.  This is a good study on the matter:   http://scholar.princeton.edu/sites/default/files/mgilens/files/gilens_and_page_2014_-testing_theories_of_american_politics.doc.pdf  The conclusion is basically that the vast majority of Americans have almost no effect of policy whatsoever.   Thus when popular majorities favor the status quo, opposing a given policy change, they are likely to get their way; but when a majority - even a very large majority - of the public favors change, it is not likely to get what it wants. In our 1,779 policy cases, narrow pro-change majorities of the public got the policy changes they wanted only about 30 percent of the time. More strikingly, even overwhelmingly large pro-change majorities, with 80 percent of the public favoring a policy change, got that change only about 43 percent of the time."

This is telling US corporations that it is ethical to exploit workers in other countries (begging the question of if they can even be called US-corporations) and that is moral to lay off a workforce in order to increase profit margins. People that oppose the agreement will surely be called isolationists which is only fair to a degree.

People were outraged by the lack of support Veterans were receiving after returning from two wars the public majority had turned against. Supporting veterans and dealing with the failures of the VA had become a moral obligation, especially after evidence revealed the VA was unable to accommodate the growing mental and physical health problems facing the military population. The public response had nothing to do with continuing military policy in the Middle East and abroad, but rather, the slogan encapsulates the moral significance of the idea that policy is irrelevant to the support of Service members. This is why the VA has faced such harsh criticism, and why VA services are being improved drastically across the country.  Perhaps more importantly, the ""support our troops"" Yellow Ribbon graphic was created by a Canadian Service member and family support program, and it is still understood to generalize the sentiment people ought to support Service members irrespective of policy. In fact, it seems to me the slogan may have the opposite effect of Chomsky's assertion: it may have allowed more people to disagree with military and federal policy as the notion allows for a delineation between an individual's stance on policy and their support of Service members.   Likewise, the slogan may also have the benefit of promoting a view that separates Service members from the policy they are ordered to carry out."

chomsky,36zogs,Propertronix6,1 point,Mon May 25 03:04:13 2015 UTC,How do you feel about this article on the slogan's use?
chomsky,36zogs,TheTimespirit,1 point,Sun May 24 14:10:10 2015 UTC,"Not an argument against anyone genuinely concerned about the troops welfare, no, but against people who abuse the term, primarily hawkish politicians criticising those who criticise the use of military power."
chomsky,36zogs,Propertronix6,0,Sun May 24 15:30:13 2015 UTC,"I think Chomsky's argument is flawed and simply wrong. If anything, politicians use the slogan to appease their constituents; constituents who have been and remain quite patriotic where military service is concerned. I don't necessarily think valuing military service and feeling morally obligated to Service members implies unconditional acceptance, support, or passive support for federal policy. I just can't get behind his view, especially since he does little to support his contention or examine it in any meaningful way."
chomsky,36zogs,TheTimespirit,1 point,Sun May 24 16:35:15 2015 UTC,"Look, what Chomsky is criticizing is particular politicians using that slogan, like Bush, Wolfowitz etc. and the media using it to argue against dissent. And they did. If good-intentioned people are genuinely supporting the troops that doesn't fall under his criticism."
chomsky,36zogs,RonjinMali,0,Sun May 24 16:52:27 2015 UTC,"Listen to the Chomsky audio again. You're wrong, and Chomsky is wrong. The purpose of the slogan, its history, and its creation is nothing like his argument. It's flawed and has no evidence or research to support it."
chomsky,36zogs,samsterlicious,1 point,Sun May 24 16:57:47 2015 UTC,"No, we aren't. It might very well be that the slogan originated from somewhere that was not ""planned"", but it cannot be questioned that the aforementioned politicians and media in general hijacked the term and started to use it to argue against dissent and brand anti-war people to be unpatriotic. AND it worked as well. This is all very well documented, I realize this is personal subject for you."

chomsky,36zogs,TheTimespirit,1 point,Wed May 27 23:00:41 2015 UTC,"You didnt have an argument, how do you think that discussion went?  You basically said that the slogan did not originate from where Chomsky implied it was coming from. This could very well be true but when people point out to you that regardless who initiated the ""campaign"" it is impossible to deny that it was used heavily for propaganda and the term nowadays is much more strongly associated with that than it is with the perhaps original cause."
chomsky,36zogs,RonjinMali,1 point,Mon Jun 8 23:15:18 2015 UTC,"Again, I disagree the slogan was implemented as a public affairs campaign aimed at quelling dissent of the Iraq War. If it were the case, it would seem to me that there would be quantitative evidence indicating a rise in support for the Iraq and Afghanistan wars.  Consider this evidence from PEW research conducted in 2011: http://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2011/10/05/war-and-sacrifice-in-the-post-911-era/  ""The public makes a sharp distinction in its view of military service members and the wars they have been fighting. More than nine-in-ten express pride in the troops and three-quarters say they thanked someone in the military. But a 45% plurality say neither of the post-9/11 wars has been worth the cost and only a quarter say they are following news of the wars closely. And half of the public say the wars have made little difference in their lives.""  Also consider these PEW research polls indicating that support for the Iraq and Afghanistan wars continually fell from 2003-2008:   1) http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2014/06/12/more-americans-say-us-failed-to-achieve-its-goals-in-iraq/  2) http://www.pewresearch.org/2008/03/19/public-attitudes-toward-the-war-in-iraq-20032008/  3) http://www.pewresearch.org/2007/03/15/trends-in-public-opinion-about-the-war-in-iraq-20032007/  What else can I say for any of you to actually consider my argument and the existing evidence? Just because Chomsky said it, doesn't make it true. Research public opinion and attitudes to the war, towards Service members, and reevaluate arguments... Blah."
chomsky,36zogs,TheTimespirit,1 point,Wed Jun 10 09:52:07 2015 UTC,"Yes people can make the distinction between the actual soldiers fighting and the people in charge of the wars. This is hardly surprising.   But you're focusing on wrong issues here, the point is that despite the fact that the public is against the wars - which was the case from the beginning and with a good reason might I add.   Yet these same people view positively the soldiers fighting in Iraq? Why is this? Why are people thanking these soldiers for instance?  The whole notion of ""support the troops"" is nothing more than empty rhetoric and it doesn't mean anything. Your gang of murderers in Iraq are being ""supported"" by the public which gives a positive framework for the whole operation. Also at least from my experiences in the States you cannot even plausibly state that you do not respect the vets or that you have no support for soldiers, this is something that many people might think but you simply cannot state out loud."
chomsky,36zogs,TheTimespirit,1 point,Wed Jun 10 14:35:39 2015 UTC,"Again, no evidence, unsubstantiated claims, and an invalid argument.   ""Murderers,"" you call them. I see your bias. I've already declared mine, and I've produced data to support my claims.  You do raise larger ethical questions: are Service members responsible for their actions when carrying out orders and/or are defending themselves in conflict? When are orders just? When is conflict just?"
chomsky,36zogs,TheTimespirit,1 point,Wed Jun 10 15:50:20 2015 UTC,"You're right, calling Service members murderers is socially unacceptable in the United States, but it's doubtful it's related to the slogan, and it's more likely due to America's long military tradition of service and national pride.  I don't see how this is related to my argument, or defends Chomsky's assertion."

So government is actually a lesser evil than global capitalism, which was a perhaps surprising development, not anticipated by philosophers like Adam Smith and Von Humboldt. They suffered mostly due to government oppression and did not anticipate the rise of global corporations. If they did see what was happening today, they would criticize it sharply, Chomsky says.

Even if they‚Äôre anarchists who regard the state as totally illegitimate, as I do, they realize that it is necessary to protect the public arena, which means state power. The reason is, when you eliminate the public arena and the one institutional structure in which people can, to some extent, participate, namely the state, you‚Äôre just handing over power to unaccountable private tyrannies that are much worse. So you protect the public arena, recognizing that it‚Äôs illegitimate in its current form, and that you ultimately want to eliminate it.

It's a whitewashing of history of massive proportion to say that it was a righteous, honourable war, and glorious war. It was not.  If you look at the history of the war, Vietnam was fighting for freedom from it's colonial rulers, France, who was supported militarily by the USA from 1945-1954. The vietnamese eventually won that war against the French/Americans, and there was a peace accord, the Geneva convention, which the Americans refused to sign, calling for a democratic election in South Vietnam. That election was never held. The USA then supported extremely harsh dictatorships in South Vietnam, repression so harsh they killed over 60000 civilians before 1961. Then in 1961 the US invaded South Vietnam, to maintain these dictatorships. In 1965 the war was escalated hugely.  This escalation was provided for by the Gulf of Tonkin incident, which was almost certainly a fabrication. There is no evidence that US naval forces were ever fired upon. It was an aggressive war, the US invaded South Vietnam based on a false flag attack. Even the official history acknowledges that.  It was an extraordinarily brutal war. The level of damage caused by the American military machine unleashed on a tiny poor nation is just staggering. Do you even know how many Vietnamese were killed? It's estimated at 3-5 million. Out of a country whose population was about 20 million people.  So it's virtually a Holocaust. The devastation is just staggering. I'd say it compares with Poland and the Soviet Union under Hitler.  Now as you can see it was a war of aggression against a national uprising, against a neo-colonial dictatorship/military rule.   Now I don't have anything against ordinary soldiers, they did not cause the war, it was the US government which started this war, which sent US soldiers to go and kill and die, cynically. It's the institutions which are wrong. There is no honour in aggressive war."

Hell, waaay back in the 1960's, (where were you?), in high school I studied it on my own then wrote up an essay on the '54 Geneva convention, the fraudulent elections, Kennedy weighing it out with advisors giving him poles apart recommendations along with the very real Red Scare domino effect that Eisenhower had brought up, to phuckin' LBJ escalating the shit out of our involvement, to Tricky Dick dragging his self-serving heals to end the goddammit thing. Fair enough?  All of which disregards the title, (once again), of this post.

Which atrocities in particular were you thinking about, because by far the most that I'm aware of were committed by the South Vietnamese regimes under the auspices of US control.   Most Vietnamese were innocent civilians and defending themselves from attack, those are the ones we should honour, and who are forgotten.   Anyway as Chomsky points out its all good and well to point out the atrocities of other governments and condemn them, however there's not much we can do about it. What we should condemn if we are want to make a difference, are those crimes of our own government, even if the others are far worse! Because it is in our power to change that."

Along comes the Viet Cong, supplied thru the Ho Chi Minh trail by the NVA back as far as the late 50's, long before the US major escalations of the Johnson era. (And you erroneously stated the US started this war).  Viet Cong ruled the night in these hamlets, through threat, coercion, whatever it takes. The US, the ARVNs, along with other countries military's, ruled the day. The hamlets were caught smack in the middle.  From either side, if they were found to be friendly to the enemy, then these the simple living rural people paid the price. Get it?  The Viet Cong's actual ruthlessness? .... ""Many Viet Cong units operated at night, and employed terror as a standard tactic. Rice procured at gunpoint sustained the Viet Cong. Squads were assigned monthly assassination quotas. Government employees, especially village and district heads, were the most common targets. But there were a wide variety of targets, including clinics and medical personnel. Notable Viet Cong atrocities include the massacre of over 3,000 unarmed civilians at Hue, 48 killed in the bombing of My Canh floating restaurant in Saigon in June 1965 and a massacre of 252 Montagnards in the village of √ê?k Son in December 1967 using flamethrowers. Viet Cong death squads assassinated at least 37,000 civilians in South Vietnam; the real figure was far higher since the data mostly cover 1967-72. They also waged a mass murder campaign against civilian hamlets and refugee camps; in the peak war years, nearly a third of all civilian deaths were the result of Viet Cong atrocities. Ami Pedahzur has written that ""the overall volume and lethality of Viet Cong terrorism rivals or exceeds all but a handful of terrorist campaigns waged over the last third of the twentieth century"".(Source - Wikipedia - 2013)  So once again, phuck that Chomsky ass-wipe telling others who they should honor while brushing aside the whole picture. goodbye.

Here is what they found on the issue of Islam, the Middle East, and the U.S.:   ""Thus, for Americans, 'U.S. values' are in reality 'world values' ‚Äî exemplified by the United Nations‚Äô Universal Declaration of Human Rights or the 1975 Helsinki Accords ‚Äî so deep down we assume that everyone should naturally support our policies.

In other words, they do not hate us for our values, but because of our policies."" (2004, pp. 45 - 46).

This is easily derived from a quick analysis of his actual arguments though as well.
chomsky,366twb,Tumbleweed_Alley,0,Sun May 17 14:42:33 2015 UTC,"Ok, well read this (which I bet you won't, because your beliefs have already crystallized): http://www.samharris.org/blog/item/response-to-controversy#views_on_islam  But if you do, please free me from my delusion and explain what is wrong with Harris' position on Islam."
chomsky,366twb,Just-R,1 point,Sun May 17 23:06:03 2015 UTC,"I cannot free you from the delusion you share with Harris, but I can perhaps point you in the right direction by quoting Sam from the very article you linked. He states: ""Anti-Semitism is, therefore, a specific form of racism that, as everyone knows, has taken many terrible turns over the years (and is now especially prevalent among Muslims, for reasons that can be explicitly traced not merely to recent conflicts over land in the Middle East, but to the doctrine of Islam)"".   So, according to Harris, we are to believe anti-semitism is prevalently found with Muslims and it has little-to-nothing to do with the illegal and immoral (according to the international community; Israel and US aside) 'land conflicts' (convenient language to express Israeli occupation of Palestinian land and the execution of thousands of innocent Palestinians) but it has everything to do with Islam. Does this seem like an informed and accurate analysis of Muslims and current affairs to you?"
chomsky,366twb,SteinerRecliner,1 point,Mon May 18 15:29:32 2015 UTC,"Ok, well I either disagree or don't understand your reading of this statement in two respects (but perhaps we can make progress).  The first is that I don't understand why you object to the statement that anti-semitism is ""especially prevalent among Muslims"". This seems like a reasonable statement. For example, in a Pew poll from 2005 (I don't know if there is anything more recent), there is a clear trend among the Muslim countries surveyed about views towards Jews: http://www.pewglobal.org/2005/07/14/islamic-extremism-common-concern-for-muslim-and-western-publics/#views-of-religious-groups  The study says the following: ""Anti-Jewish sentiment is endemic in the Muslim world.""  So I suspect that you would not contest that ""anti-Jewish sentiment"" is ""especially prevalent"" among Muslims, but rather you would contend that it doesn't amount to ""anti-semitism"". I would like to hear your views on why not.  However the biggest issue I have is that you said: ""according to Harris, we are to believe anti-semitism is prevalently found with Muslims and it has little-to-nothing to do with the illegal and immoral . . . 'land conflicts' . . . but it has everything to do with Islam.""   This is not a reasonable reading of what Harris said. Harris said ""and is now especially prevalent among Muslims, for reasons that can be explicitly traced not merely to recent conflicts over land in the Middle East, but to the doctrine of Islam"".  ""Not merely"" has a clear meaning that you seem to be ignoring. The point that Harris is making is that there is some connection between the doctrine of Islam and the anti-semitism he perceives among Muslims. Nowhere does he say that it has little or nothing to do with 'land conflicts' and everything to do with Islam. In fact, his wording makes it clear that he most certainly does NOT mean this.  I do take issue with his presentation of information. Most obviously, he does an inadequate job of preventing misreadings such as yours. He never talks in any detail about what proportions he thinks doctrine vs. other factors are responsible, perhaps because there is no way to know. However, he most certainly does not exclusively blame the doctrine of Islam."
chomsky,366twb,Wisewoodwon,2,Mon May 18 21:23:04 2015 UTC,"My objection to Harris‚Äô statement should not be difficult to understand, but given that you did and I believe much of his readership would find it difficult is quite unfortunate for it means Harris is somewhat successful in his attempts to masquerade very complex, contextual issues as having primarily one simple causal source: Islamic dogma. This reasoning, grounded only in non-reality, embraces perpetual ignorance of the world, its history and how it works while it simultaneously justifies the actions of the equally dogmatic secular-utopian drive to ‚Äòbring democracy to the Middle East‚Äô, even if that requires illegal invasions, airstrikes, permanent military occupation, drone attacks, economic and arms support to extremist dictatorships and so on.  Firstly, the poll you linked states ‚ÄúIn Lebanon, all Muslims and 99% of Christians say they have a very unfavorable view of Jews.‚Äù So here we have two groups of Lebanese citizens of different faiths expressing the same opinion: an unfavorable attitude towards Jews. What are we to make of this? As Harris asserts, Islam is the 'explicit' cause of anti-Semitism among Muslims, not 'merely land conflicts', so are we to believe from this logic that Christianity is equally but separately the cause of anti-Semitism among Christians of Lebanon too? Perhaps there is more to this story. If we bother to look at the historical record (a step one could only wish Harris would do), we find that Israel has invaded Lebanon five times since 1978. Now is it anti-Semitism to have an unfavorable opinion towards those who have invaded your country five times in the last 37 years? Does it seem meaningful to say that it is? What causal inference can be made with confidence from this information?   Perhaps you too could look at a Pew poll: http://www.pewglobal.org/2008/09/17/unfavorable-views-of-jews-and-muslims-on-the-increase-in-europe/. Here we find the opinions of various demographics in European countries in regards to both Muslims and Jews. We find both are viewed negatively in Europe, but anti-Muslim attitudes are by far the majority. And it is worth noting that these unfavorable opinions towards Jews are found outside of the Muslim demographics. Why doesn‚Äôt Sam address these findings in his analysis? Why is he so focused on Islam at the expense of ignoring the prejudices of the West? How exactly is he making a causal inference?   Again, to your point about the phrasing of Sam‚Äôs statement ‚Äú‚Ä¶(and is now especially prevalent among Muslims, for reasons that can be explicitly traced not merely to recent conflicts over land in the Middle East, but to the doctrine of Islam"", I‚Äôm afraid you are the one who is ignoring the clear nuanced bigotry here. He is clearly using ‚Äúnot merely‚Äù to say ‚Äúnot just‚Äù, as you correctly point out, to claim a causal connection to Islam, but you are missing the point. To say there is Muslim prejudice against Jews because of Islam, ‚Äúnot [just because of] conflicts of land‚Äù undermines and trivializes the great atrocities Israel has been committing towards Palestine by regarding such events as ‚Äúland conflicts‚Äù when they are one-sided atrocities. Would you find something alarmingly dishonest in the following statement ‚ÄúThe Poles are anti-Nazi, for reasons that can be explicitly traced to not merely conflicts of land, but to the beliefs held in Poland"" if it appeared in an American newspaper in 1939?  To your last point, you are right in that he doesn't pull numbers out of a hat in an attempt to actually quantify the factors involved in extremism, but he does argue that Islam, the beliefs of some 1.57 billion people, is largely to blame if it is read ‚Äòhonestly‚Äô:   ‚ÄúThose who adhere most strictly to the actual teachings of Islam, those who expound its timeless dogma most honestly, are precisely the people whom Greenwald and other obscurantists want us to believe least represent the faith.‚Äù  In his ‚ÄúVersion 2.4‚Äù defense of endless ‚Äúmisreadings‚Äù, or ‚Äúactual readings‚Äù as some may refer to them as, he continues:  ""My point, of course, is that beliefs matter. And it is not an accident that so many Muslims believe that jihad and martyrdom are the highest callings in human life, while many Tibetans believe that compassion and self-transcendence are. This is what Islam and Vajrayana Buddhism, respectively, teach.""  So here we have Sam, in a careful defense against his generally less careful claims, plainly saying ‚Äúso many Muslims believe that jihad and martyrdom are the highest calling‚Äù. To be clear, this is not a misreading. Yet he pathetically dismisses Robert A Pape‚Äôs work (where Pape examines the causes of suicidal terrorism (or alleged martyrdom in Harris' view) and concludes the causes can be mostly attributable to military occupation, not Islamic beliefs) by saying:  ""Pape‚Äôs narrow focus on suicide terrorism also allows him to ignore all the other barbarism in the Muslim world that has its origins in religion. Was the fatwa against Salman Rushdie the result of foreign occupation? The Danish cartoon controversy? The calls for blood over a poorly named teddy bear? The movement to hang atheist bloggers in Bangladesh? What about the internecine murders of apostates in Pakistan (accomplished, all too often, by suicide bombers)?""  This is quite confusing. Is it a misreading to infer that Sam thinks that so many Muslims believe in martyrdom because of Islamic dogma and he thinks evidence suggesting otherwise is a ‚Äúnarrow focus‚Äù that ignores ‚Äúother barbarism in the Muslim world‚Äù? Perhaps I am guilty of misquoting here, as all of Sam‚Äôs critics apparently are. So let‚Äôs instead go the other way and use a source from one of his followers: you. The Pew poll you linked states:  ‚ÄúThe latest survey by the Pew Global Attitudes Project, conducted among more than 17,000 people in 17 countries this spring, finds that while many Muslims believe that radical Islam poses a threat, there are differing opinions as to its causes. Sizable minorities in most predominantly Muslim countries point to poverty, joblessness and a lack of education, but pluralities in Jordan and Lebanon cite U.S. policies as the most important cause of Islamic extremism.‚Äù   The confusion, at least for me, grows if we are to take Sam at his word. We find that so many Muslims believe in martyrdom yet so many Muslims oppose it. The causal link between Islam and extremism seems more and more grey and Islam as the primary cause seems black, non-existent. This is the case unless of course you actually want to believe, as Harris wholeheartedly does, that thousands are reading Islam honestly while the other 1.57 billion are reading it in a dishonest way and such dishonest interpretations 'merely' happen to be found in vastly different conditions but these conditions nevertheless do not affect the variable 'Islam', at least not to the degree to which one would render it meaningless in serious conversations involving US foreign policies. And remember, this is all coming from his ‚ÄúVersion 2.4‚Äù defence of critics and a source kindly provided by one of his truth-bringers (you), this is not to mention his innumerous writings that are much more blatant in showcasing his immoral apologetics to empire, Islamophobia, ignorance and inadequate intellect for meaningful critique on such important matters. But of course quoting those are forever protected under the label ""misreadings"".   Religious dogma is not the cause of radicalism nor is it even a main cause. It is utterly naive to think human affairs can be attributable in large part to them and to do so with conviction is simply ignorant parroting of the propaganda put forth by the elites; a distraction from the main factors at play. This is unfortunately what Sam‚Äôs work amounts to."

He stated it's because during the first Gulf War against Saddam, the US put ""infidel armies"" on Muslim holy lands in Saudi Arabia. The Prophet Muhammad fought against infidel armies on these locations, which is what pissed off Al Qaeda. That's a purely religious reason.  Fast forward a few decades and all the fucked up shit the US has done since then, it's easy to argue they hate us for our foreign policy.

They view Israel has having colonized Palestine, kicked out the native population and not allowed them back, and then expanded aggressivelly. 90% of land in Israel belongs to the JNF and is reserved for Jews.

Bin Laden focuses on the US and its role in enabling Israel to do whatever it does, I was mainly referring to his problem with the United States only and not Israel or the situation in the middle east. However on your point about Israel/Palestine specifically I think that it's really not a valid argument to say that 'because other countries are worse than Israel, grievance with Israel is illegitimate.' That line of argument doesn't really hold in my opinion.  Also I'm not justifying or legitimizing his reasons, I'm saying that these are the reasons he used to carry out 9/11. Whether you (or I) deem them legitimate reasons or not is irrelevant. To Bin Laden, and his supporters, they are very legitimate.  A couple of notes...   I'm not informed enough to talk about Jordan in the 1950s, but I don't believe and neither do I imagine Bin Laden believes that the point you raised would be too relevant to their goals currently or during the 1990s/2000s. Al Qaeda are absolutely not ignoring Yemen, Al Qaeda have had an active insurgency in Yemen for a decade and a half now. Make no mistake, Al Qaeda are not afraid to kill other muslims, in fact they don't believe that these people even are muslims happily labeling them infidels. They don't speak out about it because they are engaged in it."
chomsky,366twb,DeafDumbBlindBoy,1 point,Sat May 16 23:12:50 2015 UTC,"Regarding Israel/Palestine, yes thousands of Muslims have died by Israel, but in 1950 the King of Jordan killed tens of thousands of them   1950? Do you mean Black September in 1970? That stems from the problems created by refugees from the Israeli conquests. It was done because of pressure from Israel (they made incursions into Jordan and killed Palestinians and Jordanians) and the US. So the conflict Jordan has had with Palestinians is not separate from the Israel-Palestine conflict."
chomsky,366twb,Reprobates,3,Sat May 16 23:54:01 2015 UTC,"Your claim about bin Laden is pretty far off the mark. He wrote a letter to the American people, enumerating the motivations for the attack.

chomsky,366twb,DeafDumbBlindBoy,9,Sun May 17 05:01:24 2015 UTC,"What did US foreign policy have to do with the development of Wahhabism / Islamic literalism?   I'm not an expert on any of these things, but surely the British had a role in securing the Saudi control over the oil resources in the Arabian Peninsula, a relationship the US has mostly taken over since WW2. The funds from that control have since been used extensively to promote Wahhabism internationally.  I do agree that foreign policy doesn't cancel out or excuse the role of Islam, but it does shape it."
chomsky,366twb,armin199,1 point,Sun May 17 14:56:33 2015 UTC,"Oil wasn't discovered in Saudi Arabia until the 1900s, whereas Wahabbism / Salalfism / Literalist Islam come around in the 1700s, completely unrelated to Western intervention in the Middle East."
chomsky,366twb,Reprobates,7,Sat May 16 21:34:51 2015 UTC,"The U.S. was the very first country to recognize Saudi Arabia when it was created and ever since then has enjoyed a ""special relationship"" with them. They are close political allies, very strong economic ties. This despite it having a terrible human rights record, and oh course promulgating this vicious and extreme form of Islam.  The U.S. has been involved in the Middle East for a long time, ithat long maintained a presence there and has allied with various vicious dictatorships. Britain used to dominate the region in the beginning of the 20th century but the U.S. has to a large degree replaced it in its colonial role."
chomsky,366twb,armin199,8,Sat May 16 21:36:30 2015 UTC,"The rise of Wahabbism in Arabia can be directly linked to French territorial demands prior to the collapse of the Ottoman Empire. See, France and Britain were plotting between one another, even before the outbreak of the Great War, how the Middle-East would be divided between them. Britain had already wrested de facto control of Egypt away the previous century, and France dreamed of returning the Holy Land under her dominion.   The problem was that nobody bothered to tell the Arabs that Sykes/Picot had guaranteed control of Syria to France. Meanwhile, T. E. Lawrence and Faisal Hussein, son of Sharif Hussein the then ruler of Mecca, had led the Arab revolt into a position where the Arabs reached Damascus first, and not the French.   At the Treaty of Paris, Fasail and Hussein were royally screwed over, and they thus lost much influence in Arabia. This created a power vacuum that Saud was able to viciously step in to, and this is the condensed story of how the Wahabbists came to power.   The Americans, specifically FDR, would come along later in the closing days of WW2 and work out an arrangement between the tribe of Saud and the West.   There is much, much, more to the story. Start with Lawrence if you don't feel like going back at least 1,000 years."

In other cases, I didn't really feel sorry for the poor s.o.b. who had such a run-in, but in this case, it could be a career-altering encounter for Harris.

You know, he questions a lot of religious stuff and we need as many of those voices as we can get.  But, as the author of this article illustrates, in this case Harris has lost his way and gets nailed -- and I mean flattened -- by Chomsky, since he (Harris) tries to argue for American Exceptionalism.  In fact, it seems that Harris is actually unfamiliar with the concept of A.E., and basically says that Chomsky is too hard on us, and we're kind of like a ""Benign Giant"" that might accidentally step on an anthill, but you know, we ""meant to do good"", it just didn't end up that way, and so on, and so forth.  Well, probably everyone on this sub knows that Chomsky doesn't go for that silly stuff at all.  He notes that the ""profession of benign intent"" is claimed by everyone, even the biggest monsters -- and America is no exception.  ...Just like to finish by saying that it might be possible that Chomsky could have taken a hard-line with Harris in this case since he expected Harris to know better."

They mostly argue against other rhetoricians from the other, less popular side of the debate whose entire arguments are completely unscientific and have already been debated and criticized many many times throughout history. I don't follow Harris much, but watching Hitchens debates or reading his books its pretty obvious that he argues just like the 'other side', with a belief based on faith, and rhetoric as the only tool of expressing it. When it comes to logical deductions, analysis of evidence, discussion of real, complex issues, flamboyant rhetoric does not work anymore and they fail miserably."

Reeks of laziness and narcissism if you ask me, which is why he ended up getting so emotional in the email exchange, someone finally called him on it.

chomsky,363uoy,tedemang,9,Sat May 16 03:41:47 2015 UTC,"When you say that Chomsky has ""never allowed the issue of intentions to factor into his thinking"", you are precisely right -- and for two important reasons (which are detailed in the article):  As stated, the Profession of Benign Intent is essentially universal.  ...It is an interesting aspect of humanity that the greatest evils are typically committed by people who claim to be doing things ""in the greater good"" or for a ""righteous cause"" or for the ""one true god/king"", and so on.     For instance, when Emperor Hirohito invaded Manchuria in WWII, he wanted to ""create an earthly paradise"". Or when we invaded Iraq, it was to ""bring democracy"" or whatever the line was, depending on the day.   There's almost never an exception.  As Chomsky says, if we had records from Genghis Khan, you'd probably find professions of him doing things ""in the greater good"" as the Khan of Khans, etc.  The concept of American Exceptionalism gets to this in our case and says that we're different / special / better / morally superior, etc., we only mean to do good things, but sometime make a mistake, and so on.  Beyond the fact that it's demonstrably not true, almost every other major power had the same pathology.  ...Before us, of course, it was the British, who were the best & most benevolent, most civilized, etc.  ...Before them, it was the Spanish or the French... or the Anglo-Saxons, or the Romans, and on and on.

Unless you can give me some kind of method by which we might test whether Clinton's actions were sincere and 'benign' when he bombed Al-Shifa, resulting in the deaths of tens of thousands of people who could not get the much needed medical supplies the factory made. It's not very useful, which is precisely what Chomsky was arguing for. What is more fruitful is looking at the consequences (that were known beforehand through pleas made by human rights groups etc), and then concluding that Clinton simply did not care that tens of thousands of Sudanese would die, as African lives do not matter. That seems much worse than intentionally killing someone, which at least treats the victim as human."

There's a story from St. Augustine, I think, called ""The Pirate & the Emperor"" that he always talks about.  It's a true classic for the ages:   In the story, Alexander the Great captures some small-time pirate and they haul him up before the throne.  The Emperor asks him, ""How dare you molest the seas?""  The pirate replies, ""How dare you molest the entire world?""  ...""Because I do it in a single ship, I'm called a pirate, but since you do it with a grand armada, you're called an emperor.""   There's a great truth in the parable, and we need to remember that the common people are molested by both the pirates & the emperors.  But, it's been demonstrable -- from the time of the Romans, right to the Iraq Invasion -- that the Kings/Emperors/Lords, etc. do the much greater violence."

chomsky,363uoy,TuringOption,-3,Wed May 20 15:54:59 2015 UTC,"I actually agree with him. I'm beginning to understand more fully how people like Chomsky actually think.   Basically he believes that the United States is a bad thing.   The United States is, like no other entity on the planet, the wholesale exporter of international terrorism. And that's what the history of the United States consists of - one genocide after another. The idea that the United States is by ethical standards a ""well intentioned giant"", is a myth.   That could sum up Chomsky's entire careers writing on this subject.   If you actually believe this then it makes sense for you to believe also that there is an easy comparison to be made between the United States, and say, theocratic death cults like al Queada.   In fact, you could even be tempted to believe that the actions of theocratic death cults are nothing compared to what the United States is guilty of.   This is something that Christopher Hitchens realised about Chomsky, and now it seems Sam Harris also. I think thats what Harris means when he says    I now see that to the extent that he does weigh intentions, he may do so differently than I would...   ""Differently"" is putting it mildly."

It has no basis in reality and isn't even an argument against anything Chomsky has said.   That could sum up Chomsky's entire careers writing on this subject.    Oh please, tell me you've reread all his books several times just like the Chomsky-Harris emails which you just lied about. You are a clueless clown and you probably haven't read a single book by Chomsky. Which is not surprising given you have zero arguments against anything the man has actually said.

Chomsky I'm sure is a decent man with flaws like the rest of us.

Before you proceed any further, acknowledge your lies either about reading the Chomsky-Harris emails, or about what Chomsky said about Harris's accusation that Chomsky hasn't spoken on the moral implications of intention - which Harris himself acknowledges he was wrong about.

He kept to his usual, temperate self.   which is why he ended up getting so emotional   DAE Harris>Chomsky because Chomsky was a bit curmudgeonly at times while Harris was ostensibly cordial? I'm (mildly) surprised a group of self-professed rationalists are having such trouble compartmentalizing the tone and content of Harris'/Chomsky's arguments.   Chomsky, in his fifty odd years of public discourse, never allowed the issue of intentions to factor into his thinking   Chomsky's spoken repeatedly about the issue of intent, even in the exchange with Harris, so I have no idea where this canard comes from. I think the ultimate point of difference between Chomsky and Harris (and the reason Chomsky is so reluctant to indulge Harris' strange fantasies about the cordiality of brutal US intervention) is that Chomsky, unlike Harris, doesn't defer his judgements of American policy to official state rhetoric. With regards to Stalinist officials, Japanese fascists, Hitler, etc. Chomsky says this, ""These cases shed great light on the ethical question of how to evaluate 'benign intentions'.  As I‚Äôve discussed for many years, in fact decades, benign intentions are virtually always professed, even by the worst monsters, and hence carry no information, even in the technical sense of that term."" So yes, any conversation about US intention that launches from official rhetoric is totally farcical and not worth pursuing.    Sam has developed a better thesis   ""Muslims r barbarians, America #1 occupier bcuz Kant, etc."" Wow, someone give this guy a Nobel prize."
chomsky,363uoy,TuringOption,0,Wed May 20 20:29:34 2015 UTC,"Right. Hitler, Stalin, Mao, Bin Laden - they all claimed to be acting with the ""best intentions"", and so you can't really say that the United States' ""best intentions"" are really any better. It's all relative in this regard. From this it follows that no important ethical distinctions can be drawn from looking at the factors that motivate people.   ISIS want to impose a theocracy and will kill anyone who opposes them, and the United States is essentially doing the exact same thing, regardless of what it is purported to be founded on - secularism, freedom for the individual, equality under the law etc - all of that is meaningless, apparently. So any talk about the so called ""crimes"" of our enemies and their evil motives towards the U.S can immediately be deflected as blatant hypocrisy. Because look at how bad we are! We're the worst!   I get it...   And I think it's complete bullsh*t that Chomsky readers have blindly lapped up.   I can imagine this stuff appeals to people who have a penchant for conspiracy theories, like Alex Jones, who tended to find an embarrassing level of agreement with Chomsky on a number of issues.   The problem with Chomsky's position is that it's not one with any kind of explanatory power. His argument, it seems, is just a way of maintaining a biased attitude he has toward the United States.   To Chomsky, the United States is the bastion of evil, and is a fundamentally bad enterprise. All the United States has done, and continues to do, is export terrorism.   He, like you I presume, is no longer able or willing to distinguish between a secular entity like the United States - with its hamburgers and iphones - and nihilistic death cults that crucify children in public, or kill people for drawing cartoons.    I don't know about you, but in my opinion, if you cant work out the difference between guys like Obama and al-Baghdadi, or Cameron and Kim Jong Un, you're delusional. It's that simple.   It has got nothing to do with promoting ""official"" or ""state"" rhetoric, or as Chomsky moronically asserted of Hitchens that he -""worshipped the religion of the state"" - and its got everything everything to do with peoples glaring moral blindness.   I don't think people who buy into Chomsky are ready for the really difficult conversation to be had about theocracy, morality, the imperfect history of western expansion, and the reality of who the true enemies of civilisation are.

It just demonstrates the impossible task Chomsky has set himself, that of also claiming the United States is the worlds ""leading terrorist state"", and that the forces of islamic jihad are themselves functions of U.S foreign policy intervention.   Why do people who believe this continue to live under such oppressive, terroristic regimes? Why not stop living in the United States and go escape to the liberal calm of Bangladesh for instance?"
chomsky,363uoy,anstephs,1 point,Thu May 21 11:23:15 2015 UTC,"If you had read anything by Chomsky, you'd know that he praises the civil liberties of the U.S, it's democratic movements and has even defended it's view on freedom of speech in international cases.  He considers the U.S as the greatest country in the world, something you are still unable to understand because you adopt a false dichotomy - one that is arguably totalitarian in nature, as you would know if you'd read anything by him.  These tantrums therefore serve as comedic relief.  Enjoy : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKPtwYzehYM"
chomsky,363uoy,ThePerdmeister,1 point,Thu May 21 12:17:25 2015 UTC,"From this it follows that no important ethical distinctions can be drawn from looking at the factors that motivate people.    I don't think I suggested anything like this. Rather, my point was that if you, like Harris, approach the notion of ""intent"" from the point of official rhetoric, you're engaging in a fool's errand. I mean, we (the US) professed totally benign intent when we, say, levied a brutal terrorist campaign against the democratically elected Sandinista government of Nicaragua; we professed benign intent when we overthrew the democratically elected government of Chile in 1973 (and, we professed benign intent when we, as a corollary, supported a brutal military junta, concentration camps, death camps, etc.); we professed benign intent when we bombed a radio tower in Serbia (a war crime/terrorist act by nearly all accounts but our own); we professed benign intent when we invaded Vietnam and herded rural folk into ""strategic hamlets"" (what were more or less concentration camps) by way of air raids to ""protect"" them from the guerrilla forces who the rural folk happened to be supporting; we professed benign intent when we supported the brutal dictator Saddam Hussein; we then professed benign intent when we sought to depose him; we professed benign intent when we committed the ""supreme international crime"" of aggression by invading Iraq (described in the Nuremberg tribunals as ""differing only from other war crimes in that it contains within itself the accumulated evil of the whole""), razing a great deal of infrastructure, killing upwards of 1-2 million civilians, displacing millions more, etc.; going back a bit further, we professed benign intent when we slaughtered or displaced millions of aboriginals and enslaved millions of Africans (familiarize yourself with ""white man's burden,"" ""manifest destiny,"" ""the great chain of being,"" and so forth); perhaps especially relevant to this conversation, we profess benign intent when we politically, militarily, and economically support the brutal dictatorship in Saudi Arabia, the global ideological centre of Islamic radicalism, the principal financier of Jihadist groups, and America's second greatest ally in the region; hell, we professed benign intent when we gathered a disparate bunch of radical Islamic groups, armed them, funded them, then set them loose in Afghanistan to kill Soviets.   I think it can be useful to account for intent, but examining intent and examining professed intent are two totally separate endeavors (this is why it's especially ridiculous to see you compare some PR stunt by the Bush administration -- an administration responsible for the greatest atrocity of the 21st century -- with the leader of some radical Islamic group).    ISIS want to impose a theocracy and will kill anyone who opposes them, and the United States is essentially doing the exact same thing  He, like you I presume, is no longer able or willing to distinguish between a secular entity like the United States - with its hamburgers and iphones - and nihilistic death cults that crucify children in public, or kill people for drawing cartoons.    Re: the first quote, this might be the most germane thing you've said in this comment thread, and it wasn't even sincere. Yes, ISIS is a monstrosity (something Chomsky has readily admitted on more than a few occasions), and yes, it follows a brutal fundamentalist interpretation of some given text; on this matter, I don't think the US is substantially different. Generally speaking, the sort of ""religion"" we follow (and violently impose, if necessary) is some global variety of the Monroe Doctrine or ""free market"" fundamentalism (and this has been especially apparent in the last 40-50 years or so). In the case of free market fundamentalism, take, for instance, the conditions we imposed on Iraq shortly after invading: the full privatization of public enterprises, full ownership rights by foreign firms of Iraqi businesses, full repatriation of foreign profits, the opening of Iraq's banks to foreign control, national treatment for foreign companies and the elimination of nearly all trade barriers. Now, these orders were disastrous for the general population of Iraq and, some argued, in violation of the Geneva and Hague Conventions, since an occupying power is mandated to guard the assets of an occupied country and not sell them off, but the US generally operates outside the mandate of international law. What's more, we saw very similar orders in, say, Nicaragua, Chile, Brazil, Guatemala (much of South and Central America, really), Indonesia, and so on. We also see/saw this in US client states, generally run by US-backed dictators, military juntas, etc. Generally speaking, when the US intervenes in the affairs of some foreign country, it isn't as some great humanitarian pursuit, rather, US intervention is principally undertaken to secure US political/economic hegemony and implement policies that are beneficial to US (and global) elite. This isn't some wild conspiracy theory: this is just how nation states operate at this given time in history. The most exceptional aspect of US hegemony/foreign policy/etc. -- that is the major difference between the US and, say, Britain -- is that it has the wealth and power to act pretty well in whichever way it'd like. If given the unique position of power and security the US occupies, I don't doubt that just about any other nation would commit similar atrocities with similar frequency.  To return to my point, though, sure, when we kill millions of civilians, impoverish (or kill, in the case of US sanctions against Iraq, Nicaragua, Cuba, etc.) hundreds of millions more with brutal economic policies, support repressive dictatorships, and so on, our intent might not be to kill millions of civilians, impoverish hundreds of millions more, support brutal dictatorships, and so on; rather, our goal is to secure US interests abroad, and the above atrocities are just a corollary of establishing our interests (refer to Chomsky's ""ant squashing"" metaphor for a discussion of what this might mean ethically). I mean, this sort of instrumental thinking isn't significantly different from German or Italian fascism, and while it might be an interesting theoretical pursuit to compare Nazism with ISIS' brand of violent fundamentalism, I hope you'll forgive me if I find myself more concerned with the savagery of the richest and most powerful nation in history (and a nation that commits atrocities with my tacit support) than with some group of lunatics halfway across the world -- a group of lunatics who happened to crop up as a fairly predictable consequence of 70+ years of US intervention, I should add.  Just as an aside, the US has the highest rate of religious fundamentalism in the economically-developed world, and this fundamentalism is often mobilized to drum up support for brutal intervention. Take, say, Bush Jr.'s famous claim that ""God told [him] to end the tyranny in Iraq"" (the tyranny we'd supported for a couple decades, no less), for instance. This notion that the US is secular, despite its rates of fundamentalism, despite the prevalence of religious imagery and terminology in official political rhetoric, despite its continued support for Israel, despite the fact that a large subset of the population literally believes we're fighting some sort of holy war in the Middle East, etc. -- I mean, this is just totally farcical.    To Chomsky, the United States is the bastion of evil, and is a fundamentally bad enterprise. All the United States has done, and continues to do, is export terrorism.    This sort of rhetoric is no better than propaganda terms like ""anti-American"" or ""anti-Soviet,"" so could we please drop this sort of disingenuous language? Chomsky's never said anything like ""the US is pure evil"" and ""all the US does is wrong,"" and to make such senseless points belies your ostensible familiarity with Chomsky's work.   I can imagine this stuff appeals to people who have a penchant for conspiracy theories, like Alex Jones, who tended to find an embarrassing level of agreement with Chomsky on a number of issues.    This is just intellectual hackery. Jones and Chomsky also disagreed on a number of significant points, and I'm certain I could sit down for an hour and find substantial points of accord between Jones and Harris or Jones and any sort of political thinker. I might think Lenin's writings on Imperialism are especially informative, but this doesn't mean I'm thereby a proponent of Bolshevism, etc."

And it's only an important question if you argue compulsively, as Harris does, that ""we"" are ""morally superior"" to our ""enemies.""  Whereas Harris would like to focus on the latter, Chomsky would rather we focus on where we act immorally, and that we do something about it.

So your puzzlement about my attitude towards intentions generally is quite understandable.  There can be no general answer.  Accordingly, you give none.  Nor do I.

He's concerned with judging the outcome intended by Japanese fascists, or the American government, or Islamic fundamentalists, and the earnestness of their beliefs doesn't really factor in to the importance of intentions that he's interested in.  Fascists want to create a certain kind of world, and the fact that they consider it a ""good"" kind of world (because of course they do) shouldn't stop us from disagreeing with them. Sam isn't advocating that we tolerate every action that is argued for earnestly, he's advocating that we look at intentions in terms of what people want to happen, and judge that outcome based on our own value systems. Then we know what kind of actors we're dealing with, at least in that one narrow sense.  It may be pedantic to focus this extensively on a parenthetical, but is that really out of place in this discussion? I'm happy to hear how I'm full of it."

Even then there are different ethical systems to judge intentionality by (strict utilitarianism, etc.).   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalization  Maybe I can give a better example, if you say ""in general I go to the bar every monday"", everyone understands that means there are exceptions.

To even consider it is to give any validity to that position. I suggest you review the evidence and tell me why the US would block a UN investigation.  The second and biggest problem with the question is that it was only posed in order for Harris to say ""look we might be terrible but certainly you cannot say we are as bad as Al-Qaeda"". That depends whether you take for granted that someone who shoots an automatic rifle into a crowd with the intent to kill people because he considers them his enemies is worse than someone who callously shoots an automatic rifle into a crowd and doesn't care if someone dies or not. (If someone doesn't die he is not less or more pleased than if someone did die.)

And no, WangkorWat may or may not have learned from Chomsky to perceive your comments as nonsense, thus it's patronizing to assert such.  So it's ironic you're telling him that he learned well from Chomsky to assert nonsense where they may or may not be any, considering you could say you've learned well from Chomsky to assert he's learned well from Chomsky too.  I'm all for conversation and am glad you submitted your post here for the discussion that has followed. However, these are some the same exact reasons Harris and Chomsky's ""curious non-exchange"" wasn't a very productive conversation--not enough effort and care went into the execution of what was said and how it was said. The interest wasn't there from both sides, and the disinterest that was there became contagious.  Think about something like ""Letter From Birmingham Jail,"" and think about how it would have come across if MLK wrote what he felt. That letter is a masterpiece of how to filter words in favor of civil productivity. Chomsky didn't filter his words, which led to Sam's disinterest in his tone. Think about if you're guilty of the same thing that caused Sam himself to derail his conversation with Chomsky beyond how far it was already derailing.  Maturity is a skill, and for most if not everybody it's a difficult as fuck skill to master. But if you're not trying as hard to master civility as hard as you're trying to change minds, get a point across, or trying to understand someone else's point, then you're just grasping at straws. If productive conversation is your goal, then you'll likely miss the mark when you stoop into assumptive assertions of others knowledge.

I can‚Äôt think of a historical exception, even the worst mass murderers view the world that way. So pick the Nazis. They weren‚Äôt carrying out terror in occupied Europe. They were protecting the local population from the terrorisms of the partisans. And like other resistance movements, there was terrorism. The Nazis were carrying out counter terror. Furthermore, the United States essentially agreed with that. After the war, the US army did extensive studies of Nazi counter terror operations in Europe. First I should say that the US picked them up and began carrying them out itself, often against the same targets, the former resistance. But the military also studied the Nazi methods published interesting studies, sometimes critical of them because they were inefficiently carried out, so a critical analysis, you didn‚Äôt do this right, you did that right, but those methods with the advice of Wermacht officers who were brought over here became the manuals of counter insurgency, of counter terror, of low intensity conflict, as it is called, and are the manuals, and are the procedures that are being used.

chomsky,36164u,Searth,12,Fri May 15 08:43:49 2015 UTC,"I don't think that's a charitable summary. I think Harris can reasonably call the conversation a failure well beyond his human desire to influence Chomsky's opinion. In his own words, the conversation was a failure for Harris because it was not civil or productive. It was indeed unproductive because both of them walked away without changing their mind (not just Chomsky), keeping the same position about the discussion at hand, about eachother and about how to have discussions like this. If the conversation were to be repeated it wouldn't go much different. Not much was gained, probably because from their starting positions there was not much to gain. The other failure for Harris was that it wasn't civil. I think this makes sense if you think civility requires that we say things such as 'I respect your position but...' or 'Thank you for this conversation.' even if we don't mean it. I think Chomsky does not go that route because internalizing even small lies as a social norm is challenging to your internal consistency. For Chomsky being civil means being calm, composed and non-violent, but it not an odd norm to require little offers expressing gratitude and complaisance."

He's obviously used to a certain decor in his musings with other academics.   Chomsky is not just an intellectual of an entirely different caliber, he's from another world. He has spoken out against intellectual elitism throughout his career, and there is no argument that he hasn't already encountered. Harris has nothing new to offer Chomsky, so his insistence on having his inhumane views heard (inhumane to Chomsky certainly) rubs Chomsky the wrong way, as it should. Harris feels hurt and decides that's what the debate is about now. Conveniently so, because by claiming that Chomsky was rude to him, Harris can then effectively brush aside any prospect of ever having to realize the distortions of his own points of view."

Chomsky has always addressed accusations of anti-Americanism by making the (reasonable) argument that we should be more critical of our own government, given that we're a democracy. American history in the Middle East is not beside the point, and pointing out the hubris is not left wing masochism, but merely an honest admission of our mistakes and suggesting that we correct the things that are within our power to do so.  All of the actions we have initiated: sanctions, invasions, drone strikes, etc have had huge collateral damage. It defies the imagination that those consequences were unanticipated, and the degree to which they've been ignored or denied is an insult to the American people and the world at large. The Bushes, Clinton and Obama have all held the position of being the most powerful individuals on the planet and there's a burden of responsibility that comes with that. Chomsky is right to be skeptical, we all should be.  The apologists for US policy always describe us as being well intentioned victims of unintended consequences, but even if that is sometimes, and to some degree, true the burden of proof falls on us."

To suggest Chomsky ""seems to think he's made a great moral discovery"" is completely disingenuous and unreasonable. Chomsky repeatedly describes his analysis as framed by ""elementary moral principles"", not some esoteric morality that he has ""discovered"". Namely, one, that we hold ourselves to the standards that we hold others; and two, that we evaluate our actions in terms of their likely consequences.   The reason why Chomsky suggested one case is arguably worse is to make the rhetorical point that both acts are morally heinous. If Chomsky thought picking a side was important, he would. Whereas Chomsky would like us to identify our crimes so that we might stop committing them, Sam needs to cling to this useless ""moral"" question of ""which is worse"" in order to maintain his problematic narrative that ""we"" are ""morally superior"" compared to our ""enemies"".

He didn't intend to kill anyone when he started drinking that night. But is that a defense in a court of law? Or should the law punish the man regardless of what his so-called intentions are?"

We need to keep in mind that what mainly drives foreign policy are economic and geopolitical goals, not neutral goals, and certainly not humanitarian ones.   Finally, it's a shallow and even depraved point of contention. What does Harris want us to do, pat ourselves on the back because even though the collateral damage was predictable, it was not ""intended"", and this somehow makes us better than those that murder intentionally?

Wouldn't you know to read at least the major works written by someone of Chomsky's caliber before approaching him? I feel like that's a basic demonstration of seriousness right there.  Secondly, he should have been 100% upfront with his intentions from the start. He wasn't. He was vague about his desire to publish the exchange and should have stressed his lack of desire for a formal ""debate"" more concretely. He opens his email with suggestions that fans say Chomsky isn't willing to debate him. That made me read the exchange as an informal debate no matter what Harris was saying about ""conversation.""  Lastly, the conversation could probably never get going because Harris mischaracterized Chomsky, and that's going to offend the guy. One, because it's an attack on his position and his character. Two, because Chomsky has worked his entire life to educate people about American foreign policy and mischaracterizations of that nature allow people to dismiss criticisms of the US's actions. In fact, Harris' mischaracterizations show how much he doesn't understand Chomsky.    Take the bombing of the Al-Shifa pharmaceuticals plant: according to Chomsky, the atrocity of September 11 pales in comparison with that perpetrated by the Clinton administration in August 1998. But let us now ask some very basic questions that Chomsky seems to have neglected to ask himself: What did the U.S. government think it was doing when it sent cruise missiles into Sudan? Destroying a chemical weapons site used by Al Qaeda. Did the Clinton administration intend to bring about the deaths of thousands of Sudanese children? No. Was our goal to kill as many Sudanese as we could? No. Were we trying to kill anyone at all? Not unless we thought members of Al Qaeda would be at the Al-Shifa facility in the middle of the night. Asking these questions about Osama bin Laden and the nineteen hijackers puts us in a different moral universe entirely.    Harris outright states that Chomsky has failed to ask questions that he either did ask or dismissed. Not only that, but Harris' questions carry assumptions that Chomsky outright denies. By using these questions, Harris inherently characterizes Chomsky's position as one that views the US as a benevolent clutz whose mistakes are morally equivalent to the actions of Islamic fundamentalists.   Nothing in Chomsky‚Äôs account acknowledges the difference between intending to kill a child, because of the effect you hope to produce on its parents (we call this ‚Äúterrorism‚Äù), and inadvertently killing a child in an attempt to capture or kill an avowed child murderer (we call this ‚Äúcollateral damage‚Äù)   This is not the case. Chomsky sees the US as a calculating machine that uses force and power to further its national interests, like any and all countries that have come before. The question isn't ""Did the Clinton administration intend to bring about the deaths of thousands of Sudanese children?"" It's ""Did the Clinton administration intend to commit a military act with sufficient resources to understand said military act will bring about the deaths of thousands of Sudanese children?"" The above analogy would be correct if the avenger acted with no care about potentially killing a child in the quest to kill the child killer and if the avenger's motivation had to do with itself.  The problem is that such mischaracterizations further apologia for American atrocities. They allow people to not really delve into what Chomsky is saying. They further the view that America is a benevolent clutz. Harris demonstrates this in his writings. His apologia and naive patriotism are on display.   ""But we are, in many respects, just such a ‚Äúwell-intentioned giant.‚Äù And it is rather astonishing that intelligent people, like Chomsky and Roy, fail to see this. ""  ""This is about as bad as human beings are capable of behaving. But what distinguishes us from many of our enemies is that this indiscriminate violence appalls us. The massacre at My Lai is remembered as a signature moment of shame for the American military. Even at the time, U.S. soldiers were dumbstruck with horror by the behavior of their comrades. One helicopter pilot who arrived on the scene ordered his subordinates to use their machine guns against their own troops if they would not stop killing villagers.46 As a culture, we have clearly outgrown our tolerance for the deliberate torture and murder of innocents. We would do well to realize that much of the world has not. ""   The difference can be seen by reading what Chomsky says on My Lai:   More revealing was the massacre at nearby My Khe, with ninety civilians reported dead, discovered by the Peers Panel inquiry into the My Lai massacre; proceedings against the officer in charge were dismissed on the grounds that this was merely a normal operation in which a village was destroyed and its population murdered or forcibly relocated, a decision that tells us all we need to know about the American war in South Vietnam, but that passed without com- ment.  So while the nation agonized about the sentencing of Lieutenant Wil- liam Calley for his part in the My Lai massacre, a new ground sweep in the same area drove some 16,000 peasants from their homes, and a year later the camp where the My Lai remnants were relocated in this operation was largely destroyed by air and artillery bombardment, the destruction attributed to the Viet Cong. 81 These events too passed with little notice, and no calls for an inquiry-reasonably enough, since these too were normal and routine operations.  Medical workers at the nearby Canadian-run hospital reported that they knew of the My Lai massacre at once but gave it little attention because it was not out of the ordinary in a province (Quang Ngai) that had been virtually destroyed by U.S. military operations. The highest- ranking officer to have faced court -martial charges for the massacre, Colonel Oran Henderson, stated that ""every unit of brigade size has its Mylai hidden some place,"" although ""every unit doesn't have a Riden- hour"" to expose what had happened. 82 Knowledgeable elements of the peace movement also gave the My Lai massacre no special notice, for the same reasons.  The reasons why this particular massacre became a cause celebre were explained by Newsweek's Saigon bureau chief Kevin Buckley, referring to Operation Wheeler Wallawa, with 10,000 enemy reported killed, including the victims of My Lai, who were listed in the official body count:  An examination of that whole operation would have revealed the incident at My Lai to be a particularly gruesome application of a wider policy which had the same effect in many places at many times. Of course, the blame for that could not have been dumped on a stumblebum lieutenant. Calley was an aberration, but ""Wheeler Wallawa"" was not.  The real issue concerning this operation, Buckley cabled to the U.S. office of NewsweeJ; was not the ""indiscriminate use of firepower,"" is often alleged. Rather, ""it is charges of quite discriminating use-as a matter of policy, in populated areas,"" as in this operation or many others, among them Operation Speedy Express, with thousands of civilians murdered and many others driven to refugee and prison camps by such devices as B-52 raids targeted specifically on villages.  An experienced U.S. official, cited by Buckley, compared My Lai to the exploits of the U.S. Ninth Infantry Division in a range of similar operations:   The actions of the 9th Division in inflicting civilian casualties were worse. The sum total of what the 9th did was overwhelming. In sum, the horror was worse than My Lai. But with the 9th, the civilian casualties came in dribbles and were pieced out over a long time. And most of them were inflicted from the air and at night. Also, they were sanctioned by the command's insistence on high body counts .... The result was an inevitable outcome of the unit's command policy.53   In short, the My Lai massacre was ignored when it occurred, and the substantial attention given to it later is a more subtle form of cover-up of atrocities. An honest accounting, inconceivable in the media or ""the culture"" generally, would have placed the responsibility far higher than Lieutenant Calley, but it was more convenient to focus attention on the actions of semi-crazed G I's in a gruesome combat situation with every Vietnamese civilian a threatening enemy. My Lai did not prompt the media generally-there were some individual exceptions-to take a deeper look at the nature of the war, or to display an interest in reports of similar events in nearby areas that suggested its unexceptional char- acter. This particular massacre was made exceptional by an arbitrary cutoff of attention and refusal to investigate beyond narrowly circum- scribed limits. The limited but dramatized attention to My Lai was even used to demonstrate the conscience of America, in the face of enemy provocations. Thus a 1973 New York Times report from My Lai de- scribes the ""battered Batangan peninsula,"" an area where the inhabi- tants were ""generally supporters of the Vietcong,"" now demolished by U.S. bombardment and ground operations: ""big guns fire into the pe- ninsula as they have again and again over the eight years that American, South Korean and South Vietnamese forces have been trying to make it safe."" The report quotes villagers who accuse the Americans of having killed many people here: ""They are in no position to appreciate what the name My Lai means to Americans, J) the reporter adds thought- fully.  Manufacturing Consent   Harris points to how people decried My Lai as a testament of virtue, and Chomsky points out how My Lai wasn't a lone atrocious act and how patting yourself on the back for understanding its terror is condescending toward the people these acts affected."

And Chomsky immediately pointed out that the context of the quote taken from 9/11 shows that the US did not have good intentions.  Harris took the quote from Chomsky and misrepresented his views.  I think part of the problem is that Chomsky has a hard time with the term ""moral equivalence"" because it's basically a propaganda term.  There are different ways to measure morality and it's too easy to set up the comparison to make one event look better or worse than another.  In one case you compare the stated intentions, in another case you measure the body count, in another case you look at the economic damage, etc and you can pretty much always say that one event is morally better than the other just by choosing the right criteria.  In the Al-Shifa case, Harris is ignoring body count, relative economic damage, general suffering, and simply choosing professed (not actual) intentions to determine that the Al-Shifa bombing was morally less evil than 9/11.  On the other hand, Chomsky stated in his book that the body counts were likely similar or more in Sudan, than the 9/11 bombing.  In the email discussion Chomsky stated that the professed intentions are not likely accurate based on the available evidence.  So comparing intentions in this case (and probably in most cases) is not as simple as listening to what each side says they want to do."
chomsky,36164u,Brickus,2,Fri May 15 15:18:50 2015 UTC,"Harris read 9/11 and a few references Chomsky threw out in this exchange. That's barely scratching the surface. It's already ""poor form"" to comment on an individual like Chomsky and make generalizations about his positions in a published work while only have knowledge of one book or a couple passages of said book.   Again, wouldn't it be good form to read up on an individual with Chomsky's resume before challenging/engaging him? I know I would have read Harris's major works before engaging him.   This failure is highlighted by Harris' mischaracterizations. Also, it's telling that Harris now dismisses Chomsky's beliefs (now that he has a better understanding) as absurd or laughable.   I have already criticized Harris for his ""apologia and naive patriotism."" Harris' worldview is so clouded by this that he cannot imagine modern American leaders having anything less than benign intentions. Chomsky's beliefs are backed up in his writings. In fact, it's Political Science 101 to view states as having no greater intentions than to further their interests.   As I've shown, the difference in their writings about My Lai illustrates the disparity between their thinking, and in my opinion, Chomsky has the more grounded, researched comments on his topic."

In that situation, they weren't drunk, confused, misinformed, etc., they just simply did not care. That, Chomsky states, is arguably worse than purposeful killing. Legal discussions about the nuances of mitigated killings aside, we need to focus on the actual, real-life example they are debating."

The Taliban grew out of the mujahideen, those brave anti-soviet patriots that resisted the Soviet Invasion, and were given all the Stinger missiles they could ask for. ISIS grew out of the power vacuum left by Saddam's death and US withdrawal; Saddam whom the US propped up during an 8 year war with Iran because Iran became a major enemy when it bucked American control. Saudi Arabia traded its oil for US petrodollars, meanwhile oppressing its people horribly. When the Saudi dynasty collapses, and it will, either due to political turmoil or because the oil dries up, the Saudi people won't see the US too fondly either.

Anyone who thinks Sam Harris was earnest about having a mutual exchange should again read the email exchange carefully and keep in mind this was a private exchange of letters where each party had all the time in the world to write a reply. Ask yourself if you would be so evasive and ignore the points the person you are corresponding with is making.  Harris might be so delusional it's possible he believes he made a genuine effort. But the record stands. Let's look at Chomsky and Harris. One of these things is not like the others. One endeavors to answer all the private emails he gets from nobodies.

The sole content he does bring up references how the 'left' is masochistic for saying that 'we' created ISIS. Jeez Sam, this notion is not some abstract speculation - evidence is at your fingertips. How can you not see 'us' as being responsible for ISIS. The US (et al.) invaded Iraq. They disbanded the largely Sunni Iraqi military. They installed a highly partisan/sectarian Shia president who outright persecuted Sunnis. Fleeing in despair - this disenfranchised group (many of whom had military training) became ISIS.

He uses the classic language of apologists, e.g. ""good intentions"", ""moral equivalence"", while I have no doubt at the same time thinking he is immune to propaganda.  Language can have a very significant effect in our thinking and this is manifest in Harris. All these nice phrases floating around and he makes great use of them. While using them he betrays to Chomsky exactly where he is coming from, which is why it is not difficult for Chomsky to make the conclusion he is another state apologist.  Harris seems blind to what he looks like; a simplistic parrot, a mouthpiece; a regurgitator, a propagandist.  At least Buckley seemed to know what he was doing."

Sam may want to debate that point philosophically, but I hope he starts looking into specific cases to see what U.S. intentions really are. Sam's a philosopher, not a journalist, but when he steps into political matters he needs to support his premises with hard evidence or else he'll continue to come off as a neocon to liberals who only hear of him when his otherwise liberal views are being attacked from the left on the role of Islam in terrorism. This caricature of Sam Harris as an evil and irrational right winger that comes from the far left is really rather odd when you're familiar with Sam Harris, and I say this as a big Chomsky fan."

Unless being a philosopher amounts to calling yourself one even if you have contributed nothing to the field.  He doesn't come off as a neoconservative because he isn't one. That is obvious. But it doesn't mean he is a liberal either.  Someone who entertains the idea of torture and profiling, despite evidence that neither work; that doesn't condemn the Iraq war (as an American citizen!); that believes in ""benign dictatorships""; that is unsure about Edward Snowden; and that entertains the idea of thoughtcrimes is not a liberal.  Would you call an Arab Muslim who writes an article titled ""In defense of suicide bombing"" outlining a fantastical and original hypothetical in which suicide bombing can be justified a liberal? And if we're being fair you could make a better case for suicide bombing than you could for torture given that the latter just doesn't work. But who cares about facts? Not Sam Harris."

The wifi it connect to the Internet on was developed by the Australian governments scientific R&D body the CSIRO.  The Internet was developed by the Pentagons DARPA program.  The LCD screen it uses was developed by the British military.  Its wafer circuit boards and computer technology in general were spun off from the guidance computers on ICBMs and the Apollo space capsule.  The diodes were developed by Bell Telephones laboratory when they had all the money pouring in from a government granted monopoly.  The automated assembly of the circuits began life in the Pentagons mantech program - the military itself took on the job of developing automated manufacturing.  The containerised shipping that distributed its parts around the world and then brought the final product to me was developed by the Pentagon to speed up logistics in the Korean War.  The us military has taken on advanced scientific R&D funding because such things wouldn't last 2 seconds in the free market and because doing it through the military is extraordinarily wasteful ensuring loads of money for the rich.  You could purely develop a computer, or you could develop a missile that needs a guidance computer and build thousands of them and store them and test them which means more money and more white collar engineering and management jobs - and also heightens tensions.

chomsky,35v0xu,ThePerdmeister,5,Wed May 13 19:14:08 2015 UTC,"Government is ultimately required to operate in the open, even if it is several steps into the process. Government has to have an open meeting, to which anyone can either attend, get a transcript, or get audio, or video. Your local city council has fairly strict open meeting requirements, where citizens can make comments on proposals, and counselors can't have an unannounced or closed meeting (for instance, of three or more members on a golf course) to discuss any city business.   Meanwhile corporations have closed meetings from beginning to end. The public ultimately only gets to know what they publish in their annual report, or what is reported to the secretary of state, or the IRS. For all we know they are plotting with terrorists.  BTW, this unaccountability is ten times worse for religious corporations. They don't have to show what kind of money they have, or what they are doing with it AT ALL. That is why you almost never hear about any kind of internal scandals concerning religions. They are well able to cover up almost anything, because they don't have to call police about it. What would they do if they did? You can't steal from yourself. Very often, they will designate a tiny fraction of money to be controlled by a board of deacons, just to give the illusion that they are totally accountable, but it amounts to almost nothing. And women? If a women's group of some religion gets to control any money at all, it is an extremely tiny bit compared to the whole."

In our current system, corporations have run completely amok, and it's going to take some significant reforms in terms of governance and maybe even switching to co-op's or non-profits or something else.  ...yes, my friend, I'm afraid we'll all have to join those darn long-haired, dirty hippies, on a farm with some free love or something.  ...Not sure, but we're really going to need some big changes.

Since the bulk of societies resources are owned by corporations, which are controlled by tiny groups of managers exclusively, we are shit out of luck. They can only be controlled via the State, which is actually how they derive their power in the first place e.g. property law, corporate law, labor law, etc. The managers/CEOs might respond to public opinion to a degree, but that is mainly for PR reasons, or they respond to consumer demand, but that is limited only to those consumers who buy their products, so long as the consumers are not totally dependent on the product e.g. fossil fuels. Either is marginal in the grand scheme of things. Whereas in theory any person can have a say in their government, there is at least some degree of transparency, and to the extent this doesn't happen it is because corporations use their ownership over resources to control political actors."

chomsky,35l6sd,Brickus,8,Mon May 11 12:12:15 2015 UTC,"[Harris believes] The act is judged simply by its intentions. If the intention was to destroy a terrorist training camp via a Hellfire missile, and civilians were accidentally killed in the process, the civilians do not enter into any moral calculation.   I think this kind of misses the main point of the argument between Harris and Chomsky.  They both agree that intentions matter ethically.  Where they disagree is on the actual intentions of the Clinton administration in the Al-Shifa case, and Chomsky's view of intentions in general I think is more nuanced.  Harris believes that the Clinton administration acted responsibly on sufficient evidence that the factory was producing chemical weapons, and that the resulting loss of lives and resources was minimal compared to the goal.  Chomsky, on the other hand believes that if the Clinton administration had done a minimal amount of research they would have found that the factory did not have any link to chemical weapons and destruction of the factory would cause significant lose of lives and resources.  So the Clinton administration either did not do a minimal amount of research before hand (less likely), or they chose to ignore the evidence available to them (more likely).  Chomsky seems to believe they ignored this evidence because casualties and economic damage in a relatively poor and insignificant country like Sudan do not have the same value in their minds as the larger more powerful countries.  Chomsky describing how the Clinton administration values the people of Sudan: ""just as we don‚Äôt care if we kill ants when we walk down the street"".  Harris' view of intentions seems to be fairly black and white.  I.e. did we intend to hurt innocent people or not.  Chomsky adds another option which is whether we considered the possible humanitarian costs at all, and asserts that this is sometimes worse than intentionally hurting them.  It's kind of like the difference between intentionally hurting someone because they wronged you, and dumping toxic waste into a poor neighborhood's water supply because you want to get rid of the waste, and you just don't really care what happens to people in that neighborhood.  Chomsky believes the Al-Shifa bombing is more like the second case than the first.  I think this is why Harris was struggling to understand what Chomsky was saying.  Because he hadn't previously considered something like negligence as being related to intention in this case."
chomsky,35l6sd,buttdevourer,3,Mon May 11 19:09:08 2015 UTC,"Harris' view of intentions, as proved time and again, is that ""we"" do good or try do good. That's what a lot of people seem to be missing. There's rarely malevolence in western actions according to Harris. From that it follows that if we're intending to do good, then deaths of innocents that are caused as a result do no enter into the calculation because they're supposedly accidental and were never taken into consideration in the first place.  Harris' view isn't even black and white; it's purely white, i.e., we always intend to do good. If that's the case, and it is, then it follows that civilian deaths can be ignored, which he does, because they're an externality.   His comments on Hezbollah and Israel are examples of this. It was known at the time about the cluster bombs yet he wrote what he did.   Thanks for your comment btw, although I think we agree more than not."

chomsky,35l6sd,Bleuski,3,Tue May 12 00:35:51 2015 UTC,"Harris was simply addressing what he considered a relatively black(to reference your ""purely white"") assessment of the U.S by Arundhati Roy:  ""[T]he U.S. government refuses to judge itself by the same moral standards by which it judges others. . . . Its technique is to position itself as the well-intentioned giant whose good deeds are confounded in strange countries by their scheming natives, whose markets it‚Äôs trying to free, whose societies it‚Äôs trying to modernize, whose women it‚Äôs trying to liberate, whose souls it‚Äôs trying to save. . . . [T]he U.S. government has conferred upon itself the right and freedom to murder and exterminate people ‚Äúfor their own good.‚Äù  And Harris' response was just a little more nuanced than you made it out to be: ""But we are, in many respects, just such a ""'well-intentioned giant.'"""

chomsky,35l6sd,Azsu,2,Tue May 12 01:45:23 2015 UTC,"In this view, because collateral damage is not intentional on the part of leaders, what we do that causes civilian deaths in the first place is therefore not judged by the supposedly unexpected outcome of collateral damage.   Where does Sam ever say collateral damage is unexpected?   The act is judged simply by its intentions. If the intention was to destroy a terrorist training camp via a Hellfire missile, and civilians were accidentally killed in the process, the civilians do not enter into any moral calculation. The initial act was carried out for the correct reasons, at least according to those in power and their supporters, therefore the unintentional deaths of civilians do not enter into any moral calculation of the hypothetical missile strike.   Actually, this is included in Harris' correspondence with Chomsky:   Are intentions really the bottom line? What are we to say, for instance, about those Christian missionaries in the New World who baptized Indian infants only to promptly kill them, thereby sending them to heaven? Their intentions were (apparently) good. Were their actions ethical? Yes, within the confines of a deplorably limited worldview. The medieval apothecary who gave his patients quicksilver really was trying to help. He was just mistaken about the role this element played in the human body. Intentions matter, but they are not all that matters.   So this is also wrong:   The apparent intention, which Harris takes for granted, was to destroy a chemical weapons factory, with the resulting suffering unleashed on the country being of no concern. What matters are intentions, nothing else.   But this is good:   Harris simply takes it for granted that what we do is right and proper simply by virtue of the fact that it is being done by us. Harris presumes, with no evidence, that ‚ÄúClinton (as I imagine him to be) did not want or intend to kill anyone at all, necessarily.‚Äù   That is Harris' primary shortcoming. He seems unwilling to look into the details of particular conflicts to determine what real intentions were. Instead, he clings to unexamined views about pure U.S. intentions, which is rather dogmatic for a self-proclaimed skeptic and rationalist who talks so much about the value of evidence.   In Harris‚Äô view, this is a perfectly acceptable tactic, Western, and in this case Israeli, intentions being what they obviously are: noble, righteous, and always in self-defence.   I suppose the author forgot to read the two paragraphs preceding Harris' introduction of the Al-Shifa bombing, or perhaps conveniently neglected them:   Before pointing out just how wayward Chomsky‚Äôs thinking is on this subject, I would like to concede many of his points, since they have the virtue of being both generally important and irrelevant to the matter at hand. There is no doubt that the United States has much to atone for, both domestically and abroad. In this respect, we can more or less swallow Chomsky‚Äôs thesis whole. To produce this horrible confection at home, start with our genocidal treatment of the Native Americans, add a couple hundred years of slavery, along with our denial of entry to Jewish refugees fleeing the death camps of the Third Reich, stir in our collusion with a long list of modern despots and our subsequent disregard for their appalling human rights records, add our bombing of Cambodia and the Pentagon Papers to taste, and then top with our recent refusals to sign the Kyoto protocol for greenhouse emissions, to support any ban on land mines, and to submit ourselves to the rulings of the International Criminal Court. The result should smell of death, hypocrisy, and fresh brimstone.  We have surely done some terrible things in the past. Undoubtedly, we are poised to do terrible things in the future. Nothing I have written in this book should be construed as a denial of these facts, or as defense of state practices that are manifestly abhorrent. There may be much that Western powers, and the United States in particular, should pay reparations for. And our failure to acknowledge our misdeeds over the years has undermined our credibility in the international community. We can concede all of this, and even share Chomsky‚Äôs acute sense of outrage, while recognizing that his analysis of our current situation in the world is a masterpiece of moral blindness.    So what this article amounts to is a poor Chomsky imitation in the form of a summary that lacks the brilliance and subtlety of the original correspondence. It's poor work in secondary sources like this that contributes to misconceptions and unfounded ill will directed at political commentators left, right, and center. I'm sure people on the left who cheer Chomsky because they agree with him but lack subtlety in their analysis eat up articles like these, which is probably why it has 95% upvotes."

How about a book publisher, should they not be able to look at speech in deciding what to publish?   Take a look at the Levant interview I referenced in my comments.  Capitalism does create conditions where very few wealthy people are able to control, to a large extant, the information that is available to ordinary people.  Chomsky talks about how a corporate executive became aware of a book Chomsky had written.  The publisher had already generated 20K copies.  The corporate executive put the publisher out of business and had the books destroyed.  Would you agree that's problematic?  A few wealthy individuals have a lot of control over speech and information that is available.  I think a publisher should be allowed to make decisions about what is published, but I don't think those decisions should be exclusively in the hands of a tiny wealthy minority.  There are more democratic ways of making decisions like that.   Any pointers to what he has argued on this topic specifically?   I'm not sure I understand your question.  Do you mean do I have any pointers on what Chomsky has said about the kind of corporate censorship I'm highlighting here?

Basically, the Clinton administration made some some claims about there being a link between the factory and the production of chemical weapons.  However, the evidence for such a link is pretty weak.  And no attempt was made after the bombing to investigate whether chemical weapons were actually produced there.   Directly after the strike the Sudanese government demanded that the Security Council conduct an investigation of the site to determine if it had been used to produce chemical weapons or precursors. Such an investigation was from the start opposed by the U.S. Nor has the U.S. ever let an independent laboratory analyze the sample allegedly containing EMPTA. Michael Barletta concludes that there is no evidence the al-Shifa factory was ever involved in production of chemical weapons, and it is known that many of the initial U.S. allegations were wrong."

No point in bringing up the moral relativism again. Like I already mentioned neither is a moral philosopher (though Harris likes to claim he is) and there is nothing to say to a moral relativist except to label them what they are, hypocrites. When we do it it's nothing worth remarking but when they do it it's a --to quote Harris' footnote verbatim-- ""terrorist atrocity"".  Oh right, you probably meant Harris is supposed to be the moral objectivist and Chomsky the relativist. Except he isn't that, or a pacifist, or a genocide denier, or any other smear that has been used against him. If you pay close attention you will see the only moral relativist is Harris."

Why not statistical evidence and specific examples showing either angle? If you can't back up your belief system with concrete facts - then you have no business believing it. Surely one of the two individuals would catch the other in an actually debate and not let them get off the hook with it.  I am actually a Chomsky fan - I just find it quite absurd that people who ONLY like Chomsky believe he has no reason to get in the ring with Harris. I have this strange feeling that many of you feel like he wouldn't last, and honestly I would agree. Harris is a very articulate and coherent debater and Chomsky is scared to risk his lifes reputation on a public debate of this kind."

chomsky,356ezl,Just-R,0,Fri May 8 13:27:01 2015 UTC,"It's not about his age. It's about the fact that Harris has not shown himself to be able to produce one iota of fair criticism against Chomsky. How can you accuse someone of moral blindness and ignoring intentions when they were writing about these very same things since before you were born? It's very lazy scholarship. You can't just say Harris ""missed them"" when they came into existence before he did.  You could probably find many college students all more capable of having any sort of meaningful debate with Chomsky, and all of them younger than Harris.  My main point is that Harris is woefully unqualified.  PS I don't care what Steve Jobs did or did not say. He is another man who is morally bankrupt."

chomsky,356ezl,WangkorWat,-8,Thu May 7 14:23:18 2015 UTC,"Salon has a long history of bias against Sam Harris's work, and this ""article"" in particular is ridiculous - a handful of slim paragraphs taken out of context. I honestly don't think Chomsky or Harris came off as well as they could have in that exchange, so it's really weird to me to see all these follow-up comments about how Chomsky ""destroyed"" him or ""took him down"". It seems like both of them let their egos get in the way honestly, and both of them contributed to how unproductive the discussion was."
chomsky,356ezl,throwaway,19,Thu May 7 15:55:24 2015 UTC,"I think this view, though unfortunately quite popular it seems, is quite wrong. There isn't any other way, if one reads and understands the exchange in full, to interpret it other than Chomsky made Harris look like an utter fool. If we actually take what was said, we find that Chomsky addressed the argument Harris raised, clearly and convincingly showing precisely why Harris is incorrect (in taking the state's professed intentions at face value), while also communicating to Harris that his accusation was false (not only has Chomsky been writing about intentionality for decades, but he had written so about the precise case in which Harris criticized Chomsky of not doing, though Harris pathetically tried to apply it more broadly to Chomsky's work in general as well). So by challenging Chomsky to a debate based on a wrong accusation (which he did not even retract upon request!) and undergoing this exchange, Sam not only showed us his ignorance of Chomsky's work and lack of due diligence when challenging an opponent, but his position spoke volumes to his ignorance about historical knowledge, about how the world actually works and how he has a stern willingness to defend atrocities despite these shortcomings (as shown by evading Chomsky's points, not understanding that professed intentions from nation-states shouldn't be considered as relevant, etc.). So, unless you consider Sam's evasiveness, expressions of apologetics to empire and ad hominem attacks as enough to counter the facts and points Noam raised to make this a 'draw', Chomsky did indeed destroy him."
chomsky,356ezl,WangkorWat,11,Thu May 7 17:25:29 2015 UTC,"I read it three times very carefully and I have to say that I can only find fault with one thing Noam Chomsky did, namely try to get Sam Harris to say that he (Chomsky) had not written anything about him (Harris). I don't know why he played that game since Harris had no reason to be dishonest about that. Chomsky comes across as stingy and maybe even a little bit petty.  But other than that it is Sam Harris who embarrasses himself not only intellectually but morally.  People who complain that Chomsky was being grumpy are not lying but if they fault him for it they are ignoring the context. Particularly the very egregious way in which Harris trapped Chomsky into a public conversation.  After saying he didn't want a public debate but was open to a private conversation Harris responds by making it clear that he intends to publish their exchange and in his magnanimity informing he will allow Chomsky to edit his bits (not condescending at all to someone with Chomsky's impeachable record of integrity), and then in the very email he quotes all the accusations he has made against Chomsky.  So now Chomsky must either refuse to answer them, and not defend himself, or be obliged to give Harris the public debate he wanted.  That's easy to miss without a careful reading but it is there. It would be good for Harris if that was the worse sin he committed, but his inability to answer the role reversal question after Chomsky reasoned how even if you accepted our professed good intentions, we still left them to die after bombing the plant, even if it had been manufacturing nerve gas. Harris then could not answer the role reversal question without either lying or exposing the West's hypocrisy. So he concocted that red herring he tried to pass off as a thought experiment on how intentions predicate moral judgement. Except as Chomsky points out it was either irrelevant or a ludicrous analogy where our bombing the plant and subsequent actions were humanitarian in nature."
chomsky,356ezl,4grams,3,Thu May 7 20:32:17 2015 UTC,"After rereading the exchange, I agree with you. I'll admit that I bought into Harris's narrative that ""the debate didn't even get a chance to start"", etc. True, a proper debate didn't really happen, but it's more clear to me now that Harris was the one who didn't meaningfully engage with the facts here. But, we're on /r/chomsky, and I bristle a bit when I see people use this one public example as a reason to dismiss Harris's entire body of work outright.   I still think Salon is bullshit on this topic as they constantly play favorites and have a strange and specific vendetta against anyone who can be called, or has ever been called, a ""new atheist""."
chomsky,356ezl,jimmifli,3,Thu May 7 18:40:56 2015 UTC,"Isn't Harris's ignorant, self-serving, extended tone-argument exemplary of why the new atheist movement is so despicable?

chomsky,34yvtu,fifteencat,5,Wed May 6 01:29:39 2015 UTC,"Yeah I replied to a dubious fact check in /r/atheism with text from 9-11:.     With these truisms in mind, let's have a look at some of the material that was readily available in the  mainstream press.  I disregard the extensive analysis of the validity of Washington's pretexts, of little moral  significance in comparison to the question of consequences.    A year after the attack, ""without the lifesaving  medicine [the destroyed  facilities] produced, Sudan's  death toll from the bombing has continued, quietly, to  rise... Thus, tens of thous ands of people-many of  them children- have suffered and died from malaria, t uberculosis, and other treatab le diseases... [Al-Shifa]  provided affordable medicine for humans and all the loca lly available veterinary medicine in Sudan.  It  produced 90 percent of Sudan's major pharmaceutical  products... Sanctions against the Sudan make it  impossible to import adequate amounts of medicines requi red to cover the serious gap left by the plant's  destruction... [T]he action taken by  Washington on August 20, 1998, con tinues to deprive the people of  Sudan of needed medicine.  Millions  must wonder how the International  Court of Justice in The Hague will  celebrate this anniversary"" (Jonathan Belke,  Boston Globe,  August 22, 1999).    Germany Ambassador to Sudan writes that ""It is difficult to assess how many people in this poor African  country died as a consequence of the destruction of  the Al-Shifa factory, but several tens of thousands  seems a reasonable guess"" (Werner Daum, ""Universalism and the West,""  Harvard International Review,  Summer 2001).   ""[T]he loss of this factory is a tragedy for the rural communities who need these medicines"" (Tom  Carnaffin, technical manager with  ""intimate knowledge"" of the destro yed plant, quoted in Ed Vulliamy,  Henry McDonald, Shyam Bhatia, and Martin Bright,  London Observer , August 23, 1998, lead story, page  1).   Al-Shifa ""provided 50 percent of Sudan's medicine s, and its destruction has left the country with no  supplies of chloroquine, the standard treatment fo r malaria,"" but months later, the British Labour government refused requests  ""to resupply chloroquine in emergency  relief until such time as the Sudanese  can rebuild their pharmaceutical  production"" (Patrick Wintour,  Observer,  December 20, 1998).   The Al-Shifa facility was ""the  only one producing TB drugs- for more  than 100,000 patients, at about 1  British pound a month.  Costlier imported versions are  not an option for most of them- or for their  husbands, wives and children, who will have been infected since.  Al-Shifa was also the only factory  making veterinary drugs in this va st, mostly pastoralist, country. Its specialty was drugs to kill the  parasites which pass from herds to herders, one of the Sudan's principal causes of infant mortality"" (James  Astill,  Guardian , October 2, 100).   The silent death toll continues to mount.   These accounts are by respected journalists writing  in leading journals.  The one exception is the most  knowledgeable of the sources just cited, Jonathan Belke, regional program manager for the Near East  Foundation, who writes on the basis of field experience in Sudan.  The Foundation is a respected  development institution dating back to World War I. It provides technical assist ance to poor countries in  the Middle East and Africa, emphasizing grassroots locally-run development projects, and operates with  close connections to major universities, charitable organizations, and the State Department, including well- known Middle East diplomats and prominent figures in  Middle East educational and developmental affairs.   According to credible analyses readily available to us, then, proportional to population, the destruction of  Al-Shifa is as if the bin Laden network, in a singl e attack on the U.S. caused ""hundreds of thousands of  people-many of them children-to suffer and die from easily treatable diseases,"" though the analogy, as  noted, is unfair.  Sudan is ""one of the least develope d areas in the world.  Its harsh climate, scattered  populations, health hazards and crum bling infrastructure combine to make life for many Sudanese a  struggle for survival""; a country with endemic malaria, tuberculosis, and many other diseases, where  ""periodic outbreaks of meningitis or cholera are not uncommon,"" so affordable medicines are a dire  necessity (Jonathan Belke and Kamal El-Faki, tec hnical reports from the field for the Near East  Foundation).  It is, furthermore, a country with limited arable land, a chronic shortage of potable water, a  huge death rate, little industry, an unserviceable debt,  wracked with AIDS, devast ated by a vicious and  destructive internal war, and under  severe sanctions.  What is happening within is largely speculation,  including Belke's (quite plausible) estimate that within a year tens of thousands had already ""suffered and  died"" as the result of the destruc tion of the major facilities for produci ng affordable drugs  and veterinary  medicines.     This only scratches the surface.   Human Rights Watch immediately reported that as an immediate consequence of the bombing, ""all UN  agencies based in Khartoum have ev acuated their American staff, as ha ve many other relief organizations,""  so that ""many relief efforts have been postponed indefi nitely, including a crucial one run by the U.S.-based  International Rescue Committee [in a government town] where more than fifty southerners are dying  daily""; these are regions in ""southern Sudan, where the UN estimates that 2.4 million people are at risk of  starvation,"" and the ""disruption in assistance"" for the ""devastated population"" may produce a ""terrible  crisis.""   What is more, the U.S. bombing ""appears to have shattered the slowly evolving move toward  compromise between Sudan's warring sides"" and termin ated promising steps towa rds a peace agreement to  end the civil war that had left 1. 5 million dead since 1981, which might  have also led to ""peace in Uganada  and the entire Nile Basin.""  The attack  apparently ""shattered...the expected  benefits of a political shift at the  heart of Sudan's Islamist government"" towards a ""pra gmatic engagement with the outside world,"" along  with efforts to address Sudan's domestic crises, to e nd support for terrorism, and to reduce the influence of  radical Islamists (Mark Huband,  Financial Times,  September 8, 1998).   Insofar as such consequences ensued, we may  compare the crime in Sudan to the assassination of  Lumumba, which helped plunge the Congo into decades  of slaughter, still continui ng, or the overthrow of  the democratic government of Guatemala in 1954, which  led to 40 years of hideous  atrocities; and all too  many others like it.   Husband's conclusions are reiterated three years later by James Astill, in the article just cited.  He reviews  ""the political cost to a country  struggling to emerge from totalitari an military dictatorship, ruinous  Islamism and long-running civil war"" before the missile  attack, which ""overnight [plunged Khartoum] into  the nightmare of impotent extremism it had been trying to escape.""  This ""political cost"" may have been  even more harmful to Sudan than the destruction of  its ""fragile medical services,"" he concludes.   Astill quotes Dr. Idris Eltayeb, one of Sudan's handf ul of pharmacologists and ch airman of the board of  Al-Shifa: the crime, he says, is ""just as much an act  of terrorism as at the Twin  Towers-the only difference  is we know who did it.  I feel very sad about the loss of life [in New York and Washington], but in terms of  numbers, and the relative cost to a poor c ountry, [the bombing in Sudan] was worse.""   Unfortunately, he may be right about ""the loss of lif e in terms of numbers,"" even if we do not take into  account the longer-term ""political cost.""   Evaluating ""relative cost"" is an enterprise I won't try to pursue, and it goes without saying that ranking  crimes on some scale is generally ridiculous, though comparison of the toll is perfectly reasonable and  indeed standard in scholarship.     Chomsky. 9/11."
chomsky,34yvtu,Sociological_Theory,6,Tue May 5 19:49:36 2015 UTC,"On another point in this postscript from Harris, I think he's sort of indignant that for Chomsky it's not so much that 9-11 and al-Shifa we're equivalent.  The later is (gasp) even worse.  Chomsky rejects the whole notion of moral equivalence.  To pretend two events like this are in some way equivalent doesn't even make sense.  But with respect to the number of innocent dead people, if the number from al-Shifa is higher than the number from 9-11 doesn't this mean al-Shifa must be worse in this respect.  It's like Harris is indignant at the numbers."

It seems fairly obvious what this is supposed to mean. What do you think is worse: the man who purposefully poisons a town well, killing many of the villagers, or the man who accidentally poisons the well while trying to make the water cleaner, killing many of the villagers?    I think his reasoning literally follows like so: ""Clinton's not a bad guy in the way I have conceived of bad guys, so his actions must always be with good intentions (right?).""   I think his argument is entirely the other way around: ""There is not enough evidence that Clinton intended to do anything but bomb a weapons manufacturing facility, we know that 9/11 was an intentional attack by Al Qaeda on civilians, so it follows that Clinton's actions are less immoral that the Al Qaeda's actions."" Under Harris's own rules, had Clinton intended to kill civilians, he would be just as morally culpable as the perpetrators of 9/11.   We rightly treat intent as mattering all the time. It is a huge component of the American legal system. Someone who attempts murder and fails is routinely given harsher sentencing that someone who accidentally kills another person through negligence or even recklessness."
chomsky,34yvtu,Benine,2,Mon May 11 12:38:16 2015 UTC,"You can't truly ""prove intentions"" despite the fact that we attempt to. Even if the offender tells us his/her intentions, there's always a number of other variables to consider when analyzing their actions. This is especially true when the offenders in this case, state actors, will tell the public whatever best deflects criticism of their actions. Just because it's a taken-for-granted aspect of a legal system doesn't mean it makes sense as a standard for judging state violence. The two are on entirely different scales and involve incredibly different circumstances, with disparate levels of competency and expectations of behavior.  The hypothetical constructs are also quite useless in debating the practical consequences of actions taken by the state. It simply doesn't matter if we can conceive of a scenario in which the actions could be justified because we have the facts and can judge actions with concrete information based on real standards of behavior (that we hypocritically hold others to while violating all the time ourselves)."
chomsky,34yvtu,Azsu,1 point,Mon May 11 13:11:32 2015 UTC,"Whether you can prove intent or not is sort of beside the point. I think that we try to get at intent the best we can using the available evidence. And of course we don't just believe what the offender tells us; we consider everything that we can as a whole. It may be true that we should more closely scrutinize state actors for what they say their intent is, but none of this amounts to intent not mattering.  I'm also not sure why you would have an entirely different ethical system for state actors. The circumstances are different, sure, but the measure by which something is right or wrong isn't any different. Again, we might hold a state to a higher standard because of the nature of the consequences of their actions, or because of the amount of information they know, and all of that. But the same goes for any person, state actor or no.  The hypothetical constructs are there to help understand the moral principles in place so that we can better understand the foundations of ethics before applying them to real-world situations. I have no idea how you think they are useless. Sure we have all the facts in a hypothetical, and we don't always have them all in the real world, but it is the same ethical framework that we use in both situations. We try to uncover the facts as best we can about the real-world situations so that we can properly judge them according to those standards."

Chomsky isn't on board with many of the claims of evolutionary psychologists as far as I know, but there is nonetheless agreement here on how self-deception is a convenient(and adaptive) mechanism.

chomsky,34w066,KtotheG123,12,Tue May 5 00:45:38 2015 UTC,"What an awful article. This just is a clear example of a false compromise, buying into harris' bizarre 'limits of discourse' narrative. Like most Harris acolytes and apologists of western terrorism, this authoer focuses on chomkys' tone, while neglecting the actual arguments being made, which categorically debunk Harris' position.   Regarding the sudan attack, From Wikipedia:  ""Officials later acknowledged, however, that the evidence that prompted President Clinton to order the missile strike on the Shifa plant was not as solid as first portrayed. Indeed, officials later said that there was no proof that the plant had been manufacturing or storing nerve gas, as initially suspected by the Americans, or had been linked to Osama bin Laden, who was a resident of Khartoum in the 1980s.""  So they knowingly bombed a facility which they knew contained thousands of innocent people based on conjecture and zero solid evidence. This is beyond gross negligence; of course top government officials and analysis's could anticipate how bombing a central pharmaceutical institution in a third-world country would ravage the population; they just didn't care.  Also  ""Sudan has since invited the U.S. to conduct chemical tests at the site for evidence to support its claim that the plant might have been a chemical weapons factory; so far, the U.S. has refused the invitation to investigate""  So not only was there no solid evidence for these claims, the U.S refuses to actually test the ground, even after being invited to, in order to maintain plausible deniability and avoid any accountability.   ""Directly after the strike the Sudanese government demanded that the Security Council conduct an investigation of the site to determine if it had been used to produce chemical weapons or precursors. Such an investigation was from the start opposed by the U.S. Nor has U.S. ever let an independent laboratory analyze the sample allegedly containing EMPTA. Michael Barletta concludes that there is no evidence the al-Shifa factory was ever involved in production of chemical weapons, and it is known that many of the initial U.S. allegations were wrong""  And they've also prevented anyone from determining the truth! Such benevolent intentions.   How on earth can any one argue this attack was well intended? Only by dogmatically following the religion of the state, as Harris does.  This article reminds me of those people who say classrooms should give 'evolution' and 'creationism' equal consideration in schools.

It was officially opened on July 12, 1997.    The industrial complex was composed of around four buildings. It was the largest pharmaceutical factory in Khartoum and employed over 300 workers, producing medicine both for human and veterinary use.  The factory was destroyed in 1998 by a missile attack launched by the United States government, killing one employee and wounding eleven. Critics of the attack have estimated that up to tens of thousands of Sudanese civilians died throughout Sudan as the supply of necessary drugs was cut off.  The U.S. government stated several reasons for its attack:   Retaliation for the 1998 United States embassy bombings against the U.S. embassies in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania and Nairobi, Kenya. The alleged use of the factory for the processing of VX nerve agent. For alleged ties between the owners of the plant and al-Qaeda.   These justifications for the bombing were disputed by the owners of the plant, the Sudanese government, and other governments.

chomsky,34w066,mmcakes,11,Tue May 5 04:34:56 2015 UTC,"It's not a complex or fleshed out explanation of his ideas but is he wrong in saying Harris was ignorant? We can make a couple fairly uncontroversial conclusions:  1) Harris thinks intent is just about the only moral element that matters  2) Harris has very naive ideas about how well intentioned the Clinton administration was  3) Harris is liable to take claims of altruism from heads of state at face value  That's the majority share of the topics he covered, the rest seemed to be policing the tone of the conversation and passive-aggression."

The difference between intending to harm someone and accidentally harming them is enormous‚Äîif for no other reason than that the presence of harmful intent tells us a lot about what a person or group is likely to do in the future.   Now I've read it carefully repeatedly and I'm going to say that no matter how I try and interpret this I come away from this understanding that Harris believes as I stated that ""intent is just about the only moral element that matters."" It's really just the difference between saying, ""intention is (nearly) the whole story."" and ""intent is just about the only moral element that matters"". I thought my rephrasing carried the original meaning correctly.   He is referring to future actions when discussing intentions... And I certainly agree with this statement.

That wasn't the point he was trying to make here.."
chomsky,34w066,tedlove,4,Tue May 5 12:44:54 2015 UTC,"His point in this paragraph is that ""the presence of harmful intent tells us a lot about what a person or group is likely to do in the future"".   Yeah, he's actually talking up the importance of intent further. He's basically saying, ""Hey guys, also intent tells us about their future actions as well."" Which I suppose is right... I suppose a persons current intent CAN tell you about their future behaviour.   He's talking about future intent and not philosophically what is wrong or right.    That's a pretty creative way to read it I think. Let's look at what he said again so we can all reach consensus:   Ethically speaking, intention is (nearly) the whole story.    Ok we all know what this means. Let's look at context.   The difference between intending to harm someone and accidentally harming them is enormous‚Äî   Expanding on his previous statement and intensifying his belief that ""intention is (nearly) the whole story"".   if for no other reason than that the presence of harmful intent tells us a lot about what a person or group is likely to do in the future.   This is actually in itself kind of a funny argument from Harris. Someone on the wordreference.com forum defined ""if for no other reason"" as: ""There is usually more than one reason for what is being discussed, but the one being referred to would be sufficient."" Which I think is a pretty good definition. So essentially Harris is saying that, ""intention is (nearly) the whole story"" presumably for many reasons but even if we ignored all those (perfectly valid I'm sure) reasons the fact that it tells us about future actions gives the idea of intent based morality enough validity on its own.  Let me rephrase so we all understand and are on the same page, he is saying that regardless of all other reasons for intent based morality, even if all other reasons didn't exist, intent based morality is STILL ""(nearly) the whole story."" because it tells us about what people may do in the future. I can appreciate this is probably just him being creative with language (a sophist) so perhaps a semantic deconstruction of what he said isn't the best way to capture his intent. But what it certainly doesn't do is imply or explicitly state in any way that Harris doesn't actually believe that, ""Ethically speaking, intention is (nearly) the whole story.""  I want this to be clear so lets recap since these things can get out of hand quick. I said, ""Harris thinks intent is just about the only moral element that matters."" You said you have ""never once seen Harris state anything even remotely similar to this statement"". I responded quoting Harris, ""Ethically speaking, intention is (nearly) the whole story."" You then cited his next sentence or two as evidence of how I had taken his words out of context, therefore he didn't actually literally mean ""Ethically speaking, intention is (nearly) the whole story."" I've now gone to some effort to break down why no sentence that you cited even suggest that he doesn't believe that ""Ethically speaking, intention is (nearly) the whole story.""   So for you to say that ""it is the only moral element that matters"" isn't truthful. That wasn't the point he was trying to make here..   And all this time you're telling me I'm misrepresenting Harris when you go ahead and misrepresent me. Not sure if this was a silly mistake or not. My original post was, ""intent is just about the only moral element that matters"" not as you wrote ""it is the only moral element that matters"". Funnily you left out the ""just about"" otherwise they're basically identical sentences, a small but very significant difference. If I did write what you quoted (which I didn't at any point) you could rightly say that I'm misrepresenting Harris' as being absolute in his belief in an intent based moral system. I made very sure that I put ""just about"" to keep it as close as possible to ""(nearly) in Harris' statement."

How much moral value should intention hold (obviously not asking for a finite number) and is it more important than the resulting consequence?"

If the driver says ""it was an accident, I swear"", we don't just take him at his word anyway - we investigate. If we find that the driver had previously attempted to kill the victim before, that should inform our judgement. Just saying ""we can't know, so let's forget about intention"" doesn't work, else the pedestrian deaths would always be treated as a 1st degree murders.   The important point is that: in many cases though, we need not worry about the problem of stated vs. actual (i.e. insincere vs. sincere). Take ISIS, Hitler, etc. for example - their stated (sincere) intentions are objectively awful* (*unless you are a moral relativist, which is untenable). No need to wonder if ISIS are being honest about their intentions. So the confusion over actual vs. stated intentions can be disposed in many cases, because we can judge the transgressor at their word.   (... I'll take your second point in a bit)"

chomsky,34qn6s,Brickus,7,Sun May 3 21:45:23 2015 UTC,"Further reading?  It's from a different book.  Harris brought up Chomsky in The End of Faith because Chomsky's passage about the bombing of the pharmaceutical plant was ambiguous and is an isolated case that could help the point Harris was trying to make, that intellectuals can sometimes fail to recognize the importance of intentions.  I think Harris is wrong about Chomsky, and his addendum to the exchange basically says as much, but the idea that Harris was doing any kind of intensive critique of Chomsky is silly.  It was just a small example.  He doesn't need to read everything an author writes to use an example of their writing.  Besides, the passage Chomsky cites of his from Radical Priorities demonstrates that Harris was incorrect when he said Chomsky did not reflect on the intentions of the situation, but even then, Chomsky was not clear on what he believed the role of intentions really was.  He merely acknowledges that the question of whether or not Clinton thought it was a weapons plant, exists, but then says it doesn't really matter because Clinton knew it was a possibility.  This demonstrates one small piece of what Harris assumed about Chomsky's position was false, although not dishonest, because it was a criticism of the book, he never claimed to have read everything Chomsky had written.  But I guess that's the lesson to be taken.  Harris thought they were there to have a discussion about ideas, and Chomsky was there to call Harris out for being incorrect on one small line of his brief reference to Chomsky."
chomsky,34qn6s,AnotherMasterMind,4,Mon May 4 08:09:44 2015 UTC,"You're implying that because it was from a different book, Harris can't have spent 10 minutes researching to better understand Chomsky's views? Harris published criticisms of Chomsky without doing his due diligence in reading and understanding Chomsky's views. It is indeed non-serious and in fact irresponsible to not spend more time reading who you are criticizing before accusing them of ""moral blindness"" among other things. Not sure why you're giving Harris and his unfounded ""criticisms"" the benefit of the doubt here.    even then, Chomsky was not clear on what he believed the role of intentions really was.   Chomsky has been abundantly clear about ""intentions"" and has been since publishing American Power and the New Mandarins nearly 50 year ago: every leader claims to be led by high ideals and morals, and it's pointless to speculate as to their sincerity, therefore they should be disregarded and instead we should focus on the outcome of their policies.   Finally, that Harris thought they would discuss ideas is an afterthought. First and foremost he was seeking publicity from this encounter. If he wanted to know Chomsky's views, he could have just read him, like you or I or anybody else would. Fortunately, he didn't emerge unscathed."

So Chomsky is saying that we shouldn't even bother taking intentions into account because it's impractical and pointless, but that's exactly what Harris is accusing him of doing-not taking intentions into account. Chomsky's explanation for WHY he doesn't ultimately take intentions into account serves absolutely no purpose in falsifying Harris' claim that he's working under such pretenses, quite the opposite in fact."

chomsky,34qr4j,raub1,11,Sun May 3 19:05:21 2015 UTC,"His point is very simple: It's that negligently killing ""Africans"" or other ""non-people"" because you don't even see them as people, and therefore don't care to calculate the reasonable outcomes of your actions is morally worse than purposefully killing someone, because when you purposefully kill someone, you acknowledge they their a human victim, perhaps even acknowledge that it's wrong, whereas in the first instance, you just don't even rise to this remorseful level, their lives are just not even a consideration."
chomsky,34qr4j,Dymdez,3,Sun May 3 19:30:46 2015 UTC,"I can understand not letting governments off the hook for civilian casualties, especially when there's an implicitly racist sliding scale where the darker the civilians the more casualties we'll accept.  But I have a hard time with Chomsky's (apparent) idea that intentionally targeting civilians -- e.g., in a terrorist attack that essentially uses victims' corpses as a billboard for the terrorist's political message -- implies any level of remorse or acknowledgment of the victims' humanity.  It's hard to get inside the mind of such people, but it seems more likely to me that they would need to dehumanize their targets in order to do the things they do.  And that many religiously motivated terrorists actually revel in the carnage.  Anyway, this is just my early take on a new (to me) idea that I need to keep thinking about."
chomsky,34qr4j,mikedoo,6,Sun May 3 19:55:59 2015 UTC,"Chomsky is basically just driving home the point that making a decision that you know will kill someone, even if that's not your intent, is at least just as bad as killing them intentionally, arguably worse.

chomsky,34qr4j,FuckWhosWatchin,5,Sun May 3 22:20:35 2015 UTC,"That analogy is not good. It would be more precise to liken it to someone who drinks and gets behind the wheel of a tank. There we can see a more clear analogy. In my analogy, it is overwhelmingly obvious that their disregard for human life is more depraved than an intentional killer, because the drunk behind the tank knows he is going to kill, he simply does not even care. At least the murderer rises to the level of acknowledging his victims. Also, I should say that Chomsky isn't saying it is a fact that the negligent and reckless killer is more depraved, he just said it is ""arguably"" so, like in the case of the Clinton bombing, but he is very clear that it is a fact intensive analysis, and each case will bear a different result."

chomsky,34qr4j,FuckWhosWatchin,3,Sun May 3 23:11:28 2015 UTC,"I think this is the critical difference between the drunk driving example and the al-Shifa story:  The drunk driver in your example kills by accident. It's a thoughtless, negligent, irresponsible, selfish accident, but an accident nonetheless. The drunk driver does not know for sure that he will kill someone and, if he thinks about it at all, probably considers it unlikely.  In the case with Clinton and al-Shifa, Chomsky argues that Clinton knew without a doubt that the bombing would result in thousands of civilian casualties but just didn't care. He was aware of the civilians' existence, and he was aware that he'd be killing them, but it was completely irrelevant to him.  Here's where I'm getting that from:   The bombing of al-Shifa was an immediate response to the Embassy bombings, which is why it is almost universally assumed to be retaliation.  It is inconceivable that in that brief interim period evidence was found that it was a chemical weapons factory, and properly evaluated to justify a bombing.  And of course no evidence was ever found.  Plainly, if there had been evidence, the bombing would not have (just by accident) taken place immediately after the Embassy bombings (along with bombings in Afghanistan at the same time, also clearly retaliation).  There‚Äôs no rational way to explain this except by assuming that he intentionally bombed what was known to be Sudan‚Äôs major pharmaceutical plant, and of course he and his advisers knew that under severe sanctions, this poor African country could not replenish them ‚Äì so it is a much worse crime than if al-Qaeda had done the same in the US, or Israel, or any other country were people matter. [emphasis mine]  I do not, again, claim that Clinton intentionally wanted to kill the thousands of victims.  Rather, that was probably of no concern..."
chomsky,34qr4j,riks9,3,Mon May 4 09:29:32 2015 UTC,"Good points.  My drunk driver analogy is weak for the reasons you describe.  It was a hasty analogy and not meant to be perfect, but it turns out not to be helpful.  I was trying to get away from the concrete example of al-Shifa because then you get side-tracked by factual arguments about what the real state of knowledge and purpose of the attack were.  A better analogy (I think) would be to compare a suicide bombing to a drone strike against an Al Quaeda or ISIS leader, where the Obama administration knows full well that dozens of civilians will likely be killed.  In the drone strike scenario, the moral arguments and trade-offs at least seem clear enough to discuss, if difficult to resolve.  But I'm no longer sure the point is worth arguing.  I had assumed Chomsky was giving a shorthand summary of a point he'd made in more depth elsewhere, but that seems not to be the case.  His point may simply have been that Harris was oversimplifying the moral equation, which is probably fair."

There's no no precedent for a benign occupation; in other words, occupying Iraq was clearly understood to put a large part of the Iraqi population at risk.  It seems clear that knowing your actions will kill people, and undertaking them anyway, is at least as bad as killing them intentionally, but if you insist on having an analogy, a more accurate analogy would be the armed robbery of a bank. The armed robber will not kill people if he does not have to, his intent is simply to enrich himself, but he might have to kill people to get what he wants.

I recognized his serious misreading/misrepresentation of Chomsky's views and knew that there would be no way he would argue him down on anything substantial.  But he actually came out of this exchange making himself look worse than when he went in and Chomsky made sure to call him out at every turn.  And I just took a look at some of the discussion of this exchange on other subs.  It's really quite hilarious to me.  A lot of discussion of Chomsky's tone, and what they view as him being ""condescending"" (completely ignoring Harris' own condescending remarks) and very little disccusion of his actual arguments, and when the conversation does get to his arguments, they claim that Chomsky's points are ""hard to follow"" or, in some cases, that they don't even exist.  It never fails.

From Harris's first message:   ...you were quite dismissive of the prospect of having a ‚Äúdebate‚Äù with me. So I just wanted to clarify that, although I think we might disagree substantially about a few things, I am far more interested in exploring these disagreements, and clarifying any misunderstandings, than in having a conventional debate.     Conclusion: Harris doesn't need Chomsky to refute him. He does so very well himself.  PS: It's quite dishonest what Harris has done here. He wants to engineer a debate, but contacts Chomsky saying, oh, a debate isn't my priority, I mostly just want to clear up ""misunderstandings"". Chomsky says, okay, if you want to do that privately, that's fine. Then at the end of that exchange, Harris comes back with, oh, I do want to publish this after all."

Chomsky declines the debate because he claims Harris misreads him, and Harris then offers what presumably is something he regards as a fair critique of Chomsky.  Chomsky shows how it's riddled with error and misunderstanding.  And Harris never counters the charge, but goes (as he says) off into the weeds.  ""What would you think if Al Qaeda acting on good faith caused harm"" and other such nonsense.  There's just nothing.  How can he think this makes him look good?  And when Chomsky just keeps slamming him for ignoring the arguments and making further errors he just complains about tone.  How can someone be so blind as to think that he looks good here?

If there are things you‚Äôd like to explore privately, fine.  But with sources.   Harris seems to then immediately agree to... his own original request that Chomsky said he wasn't interested in:   Before engaging on this topic, I‚Äôd like to encourage you to approach this exchange as though we were planning to publish it. As edifying as it might be to have you correct my misreading of you in private‚Äîit would be far better if you did this publicly.   Far better for whom? Harris appeals to the interest of his ""readers"" and then launches into his debate as if Chomsky had agreed to this.   In his next email, Chomsky again says he ""do[es] not see any point in a public discussion."" Harris ignores this and goes ahead with his public debate, and so on.   Chomsky is very clear that he is not interested in public debate. Rather, he is only interested in refuting Harris clear, public and (in my opinion) snide misrepresentation of Chomsky's views.   Harris must have had some agenda in continuing this discussion after Chomsky had bluntly said he wasn't interested in public debate. He published the entire exchange and then expressed regret that Chomsky didn't agree to the debate and was, for lack of a better word, mean in doing so.  Harris is the one here who is interested in his public persona and winning some imagined debate that Chomsky neither saw the point of nor agreed to participate in.

So if he USA decided to bomb Al-Shifa pharmaceutical plant in Sudan, it was because they believed there was a Chemical Weapons factory there and it was justified in terms of the War on terror. He dismisses the idea that the Clinton administration knew exactly what they were doing. Sam believes what the US administration said, that it was a mistake or accident.   If he read more about the history of the Middle east, as told by Professor Chomsky he would see how often the US government lies about it's intention and behaves shockingly.  What Sam doesn't realise is that Bin-Laden and Al-Queda also believed that 9/11 was a noble mission and completely justified in terms of the US behaviour in the Middle east for the last 60 years. The intention was also noble, from the point of view of Bin Laden.  As Chomsky says, the professed intentions of perpetrators are not that important in moral questions, as outcomes."

chomsky,34kgsj,JonasTheBold,3,Sat May 2 07:07:56 2015 UTC,"I know I'm a little late to the party, but you are misrepresenting what Harris was getting at. Harris couldn't even get to the question of whether the USA acts with noble or good intentions. Before wading through all the historical facts of the matter, Harris wanted to find out if Chomsky could at least agree that intent makes a moral difference in actions. At that point, then the two could try to discuss the facts of the matter to try to determine the intent. Chomsky never gave a clear answer to Harris's inquiry regarding intent, so the conversation was unable to take off.   Harris incidentally thinks that in this case, the best evidence shows that the US government did not intend to harm civilians in the Al-Shifa bombing. But the conversation never properly got to this point, because Harris could not get Chomsky to state a clear position on what he thought the importance of intention was.   Whether or not Bin Laden thought his actions were noble is also beside the point. Harris never claimed that so long as someone thinks his actions are noble, then they are moral. This is a reductionist way of looking at the issue. While intent does matter, it is the intended action that is evaluated. So Al-Qaeda intended to kill US civilians (because they thought such an act was good or noble). That doesn't make the action alright. Killing civilians is a bad thing, and intending to do so makes such an action immoral. And it is absurd to say that Harris doesn't realize that Al-Quaeda   As Chomsky says, the professed intentions of perpetrators are not that important in moral questions, as outcomes.   I don't recall Chomsky ever even admitting to this, though he certainly implied it. This is what Harris was trying to get Chomsky to admit.  Edit: Typo"

I would have liked to see a good productive debate between these two.

But man, why is this so impossible?"
chomsky,34kgsj,bone577,13,Sat May 2 05:51:40 2015 UTC,"Genuine question. I'm also curious about the limits of discourse. I came here after reading this to see what Chomsky fans thought of it, does anyone think Chomsky came off well here?   It's a tedious read to be sure. I think Chomsky did his typical Chomsky thing. He did his best to stay vigorously on point re-iterating and re-stating his position and made sure not to let the topic blow out in scale. Primary among those is an ethical discussion on intent based morality. Harris repeatedly shows how keen he is to do just that, and while some people may find it an interesting topic Chomsky is right in avoiding it for the most part. The question for Chomsky should never be ""Is intent the most important part of morality?"" Instead he should discredit the idea that the action was well intended and point out that altruism is the rallying call of most atrocities.  I'm familiar with Chomsky's work, his approach is usually to show hypocrisy and double standards. Over and over again he'll talk about applying the same moral standards we apply to others to ourselves. We all intrinsically understand that it's unethical to hold others to a higher moral standard than ourselves and because it's easy to demonstrate this he can avoid long drawn out and useless philosophical debates. This is a key argument he'll make across all his work. This is why he kept mentioning that if a similar attack had been enacted against the US our reaction would be different.  Eventually I think he caves in and engages in limited discussion about ethics. To this end he points out the difficulty in assuming that Clinton was well intentioned. Nobody should be surprised that just about every atrocity committed in human history carried with it a veneer of altruism and we should certainly be cynical of any claims of altruism and gave some examples of past atrocities. This is a solid argument, Harris is making assumptions in saying Clinton is well intentioned. Chomsky doesn't take the bait when Harris asks if he is being ""naive"" in his assumption. It's enough for Chomsky to show the dangers of ""altruism"" and never outright call Harris assumption ""naive"".  Harris is keen on this line of thinking though, he says ""Ethically speaking, intention is (nearly) the whole story."" This isn't a very good point anymore since Chomsky has already made us question Clinton's intent. It wasn't a good point because Chomsky had very early on quoted himself saying   Others point out that the killings were unintended, as are many of the atrocities we rightly denounce. In this case, we can hardly doubt that the likely human consequences were understood by US planners.   however Chomsky says, ""I had already responded to your claim about lack of intention‚Äîwhich, frankly, I find quite shocking on elementary moral grounds"". This is dismissive, absolutely. Chomsky is saying that Harris' reliance on intent is ""shocking"" it barely even warrants discussion. I'll give you an example I wrote in another thread about the over-reliance on intent as a gauge of morality:   Assessments of morality based on the intentions of the actor has plenty of pitfalls, as you mentioned what were the intentions? In lieu of mind reading machines I think another method is probably more prudent. I know in Australian law the question isn't, ""Did the person intend to cause harm?"", instead the question is, ""Is it reasonably foreseeable that the actions taken could cause harm?"". For example, you may like walking in crowded spaces swinging a sword with no malice towards anyone. If you were to harm someone you would absolutely be held accountable because apparently you make really poor decisions.*   This is standard ethical thinking, not ""Did he intend to harm?"" but more, ""Is it foreseeable that the persons actions would cause harm?"" Quite often a psychopaths actions aren't particularly badly intentioned, they just don't give a single fuck about people. This is where the moral Zeitgeist is and Harris is actually way way behind with his thinking. I'd agree with Chomsky, Harris' argument is, ""shocking on elementary moral grounds"". Should Chomsky have explained this? Depends on the audience, personally I think it's trivial but the fact that there are people supporting Harris' argument tells me that maybe I'm mistaken. Regardless I can't blame him for avoiding it, again they aren't ethicists and Chomsky seems to want to keep things on-point and concise.   I'm not sure what Harris' game is here, he conducted himself pretty poorly IMO. I can't blame Chomsky for not wanting to debate him. There really isn't anything of worth to be gained except maybe some ego and publicity for Harris.  I'm not even sure what Harris' arguments reduce to, basically that ""Clinton is in my opinion well intentioned. Intention is important. Therefore his crime isn't significant""? His two assumptions are wrong."

I mean these ""shocking elementary moral grounds"" aren't just in Harris, they are everywhere.   I'd be cautious to say Harris' approach is ""overly moralist"". I'd instead call it ""morally anachronistic"". The flaws of intent based morality have been apparent at least from the point in the bible where it was said that, ""The road to hell is paved in good intentions."" And it pains me to quote the bible as if it's a moral compass but even then the problems with this line of thinking were apparent.  I think it's probably important to give some moral weight to honest self assessment. It's easy to be convinced of your own virtuousness. It's entirely more difficult to assess  your own actions the way you'd assess your enemies. That's what Chomsky is suggesting, and that's probably the moral high road. Just saying that ""Clinton meant well."" is really weak, both because he probably didn't and because if he did then he's being wilfully ignorant of the suffering of others, and a Nobel laureate, rhode scholar and president of the United States should know better."

I also like the quote from the bible, although they are kind of saying different things.  He definitely makes moral assertions where they don't need to be, and it is almost clear that they are headed toward a black and white distinction, especially when he is talking about those hypothetical examples.   It is a fine line between that 'moral anachronistic' behavior and what you call the moral weight one gives to self assessment, (I might call it the moral realism of self assessment, but I might be wrong in that too) and that is what I am wondering about.  Is there any work published on that?  Seems like something in the realm of critical theory, or at least a reaction to critical theory."

Chomsky accuses Clinton of doing this, and resultantly treating the Sudanese like ants.

It's water-tight since we all intrinsically understand that what's moral for us is moral for others. If these two things are different then we're doing something wrong.  I'm pretty sure it was Harris who was arguing for a more or less completely intention based model of morality.   To employ a utilitarian foreign policy strategy is to subscribe to realpolitik.   Utilitarian for who? Do you see the bombing of pharmaceutical plants as utilitarian? Obviously there's some reasoning there, you don't bomb things for no reason at all but I'm not sure the benefits of this utilitarianism was fairly dispersed across all stakeholders. Probably a better example because it's completely uncontroversial all these years later, overthrowing the democratically elected government of Iran in 1953.   Believing that intentions are crucial in ethical evaluations   They are.

chomsky,34kgsj,DyedInkSun,1 point,Tue May 5 14:44:59 2015 UTC,"""Hold ourselves to the same standards as our enemies.""   Isn't analysis of the standards we set going to always amount to analysis of the intentions behind the actions of groups and states? A better question to ask is how we would evaluate all states and groups if we were to judge them by our own standards. Just as a synecdochic example; look at the criticism of abu ghraib under the US  and compare it to the state it was in under Saddam. For decades it was a concentration camp of almost unparalleled evil, 30,000 were executed after enduring systematic limb amputation and rape. The West doesn't demand of other states what it demands of itself and Chomsky is right, it's because we're self-absorbed. Every secular democratic state with a free press holds itself to a high standard and masochistically criticises itself. Repressive regimes which limit freedom of speech don't suffer these problems, and they and their denizens will be happy to be the sadists who'll repackage our masochism for us.    Utilitarian for who?   I was just reinforcing the point that Chomsky's greatest achievements were in his staunch criticisms of the war crimes in South America and South East Asia done under Kissingerian policies aimed only at advancing the US's interests. To analyse the ethics of the US we need to draw distinctions between the criminally misguided but well-intentioned McNamaras from the amoral war criminals like Kissinger.   Believing that intentions are crucial in ethical evaluations, while believing a state or group will never announce its true intentions   What is the most reasonable thing to presume about a state's intentions? That it acts according to its interests, which, in the cases of secular democratic societies, includes acting or being seen to be acting in accordance with the principles its educated citizens believe in. The difference between having a secular, educated citizenry and a free press, and not having either, is the difference that makes all the difference, and we should be proportional in our criticisms until all nations are on level footing. The US is, slowly but surely, heading in the right direction politically (the direction of north west Europe). Much of the rest of the world is not."

Sure, in an ideal world where capitalism is gone there are other possibilities, but in the current state we have yeah, it can be reasonable to support state violence.  No, we don't need to recognize these differences between Bin Laden and Clinton because they don't matter in terms of what we need to be doing to make the world better.  What matters is we need to look at our own crimes <i>and stop committing them</i> as he said in the video above.  If you want to look at Bin Laden and conclude that our leaders are superior kind of people, fine, but it doesn't help anything.  We need to be talking about the kinds of actions Clinton took, which led to the death of tens of thousands probably in this one case they are discussing.  I think the S Korea example is more complex than you may know.  It's not just a matter of everyone in S Korea being treated as they are in N Korea if not for US intervention.  N Korea's current state is largely shaped by the war itself and would be quite different if the war hadn't happened."

chomsky,346q0h,heisgone,1 point,Mon May 4 20:47:55 2015 UTC,"In this discussion Chomsky distinguishes between ""professed"" intentions, which all aggressors assert are benign, and actual intentions, which we have no way of knowing.  All aggressors profess benign intentions, and Chomsky talks about how in the case of the Nazi's and Japanese these were sincerely held.  But that doesn't really matter to us, we dismiss that all immediately as if it's not worth considering.  But when Clinton asserts his benign intentions, though providing not a particle of evidence that it was a weapons factory, and demonstrating a pattern of disregard for the lives of the poor, as in Haiti, Turkey, and Colombia, Harris is ready to immediately accept his assertions of benign intent.  Kind of amazing to Chomsky that someone can display such a double standard.  Intentions can matter, but Clinton's assertions of benign intent should be disregarded as irrelevant, as it is a reflexive assertion all aggressors make.  Here's Chomsky's take on the assassination of OBL definitely worth a read.  Are we prepared to assert that if 6 Iraqi commandos raided Bush's compound and shot him while he was unarmed in front of his wife, would this be regarded as acceptable?  Or do people deserve due process when they can be apprehended without being killed?  Bush's crimes are far more egregious than Bin Laden's if international law is the standard."

He said that if you kill people without intending to kill them but didn't care, it's morally worse than killing those people willfuly. He suggest that he wrote about this dilemma in the past. I am not familiar with his work and I am curious about the more philosophical aspect about it."
chomsky,346q0h,heisgone,1 point,Sat May 2 13:17:43 2015 UTC,"His views on intention were quite clearly expressed in this exchange. He stated that almost every mass murderer in history has expressed benign intentions when committing atrocities. Thus using intention as a metric to judge a moral action is meaningless. If you don't think so, then you would have to justify the actions of Hitler or Mao, because they were very sincere in their intentions to create better worlds etc."
chomsky,346q0h,Hanuda,2,Sat May 2 13:32:01 2015 UTC,"Sure professed intention cannot be trusted entirely, and having ""good"" intention, doing something terrible for the greater good, pose many ethical problems. But many of those case are different. If a despot intent to kill 1 million people to put in place his ""perfect"" ideology, we should note that there is 2 intentions at play there. The intent to kill and the intent of a larger project. It's worth to address those separately.   If you gas 100 people because you wish them dead is different than if you do something that will have to unintented consequence of killing 100 people."
chomsky,346q0h,heisgone,1 point,Sat May 2 14:15:35 2015 UTC,"Yes, there are subtleties. But that involves looking at the details of each case. It won't do to simply say that intentions trump all, as Harris was arguing. In the case discussed (the Al-Shifa bombing), the intention was obviously not to deliberately kill as many Sudanese as possible. However the US bombed the factory knowing full well the humanitarian catastrophe that would result. They simply did not care. That unspoken demotion of Sudanese civilians to less than human objects (""ants"") seems much more vulgar an action than killing with intent (which, as Chomsky argued, at least treats the victims as human beings). But above all, Harris does not understand the simple ethical principle behind Chomsky's writings and actions: we are responsible for the predictable consequences of our own actions. We are not responsible for the predictable consequences of someone else's actions."
chomsky,346q0h,Hanuda,2,Sat May 2 15:04:08 2015 UTC,"For your last point, I don't see it as important from my own point of view. That is, I didn't do those killings. I'm just a Canadian trying to figure out who are the baddies of this world.   Let imagine that Clinton wanted the Sudanese dead in the same way Hitler wanted the jews dead. The matter of recognizing humanity doesn't align perfectly with one case or the other. You can very well kill people the same way you exterminate ants, as the nazis did. This is more a matter of justification than intention.  To want to exterminate people like if they are ants is certainly as bad as killing them as colateral damage even if your feelings are about as strong as  have for ants."

I'm just a Canadian trying to figure out who are the baddies of this world.   Of course you did not do these killings. However, if your government was responsible for committing such an atrocity, you would be responsible for doing something about it (as you can influence the policies of your own government, raise awareness of their actions, and so on). You are not responsible for the actions of another state you are not a citizen of. Thus you should give much more attention to the crimes of your own country, than the crimes of another. This would be true even if your country was killing tens of people. In the case of the US its even more true when they're killing thousands of people, and its the responsibility of US citizens to speak up about it."
chomsky,346q0h,rollawaythedew2,2,Sat May 2 15:46:06 2015 UTC,"I recognize the value of this argument but it's a separate question, and even for citizen action to take place, you still have to be able to recognize the various moral stance of the various actors. For doing so, we need to figure out intention right first and how they matter.   To want to kill civilian is just not the same as killing them as collateral damage and there is a whole discussion to have there.   To want to exterminate the jews is different than bombing a Nazi factory which use jews as slave labor."

He just downplays the causal significance of politics in the radicalization of religious people.  I've been subbed here for longer than I've even been aware of Harris, but the tone of the comments about him are really disappointing.

In fact, in 2005 he appeared less critical of U.S. foreign policy than I am.) The truth is, I have never known what to think about this war, apart from the obvious: 1) prospectively, it seemed like a very dangerous distraction from the ongoing war in Afghanistan; 2) retrospectively, it was a disaster. Much of the responsibility for this disaster falls on the Bush administration, and one of the administration‚Äôs great failings was to underestimate the religious sectarianism of the Iraqi people. Whatever one may think about the rationale for invading Iraq and the prosecution of the war, there is nothing about the conflict that makes Islam look benign‚Äînot the reflexive solidarity expressed throughout the Muslim world for Saddam Hussein (merely because an army of ‚Äúinfidels‚Äù attacked him), not the endless supply of suicide bombers willing to kill Iraqi noncombatants, not the insurgency‚Äôs use of women and children as human shields, not the ritual slaughter of journalists and aid workers, not the steady influx of jihadis from neighboring countries, and not the current state of public opinion among European and American Muslims.

Chomsky talked about the effect of beliefs in politics in his latest interview with Krauss, and mocked the American politicians who support Israel based on their belief in rapture or what not. So I don't think it's fair to make it sound as if Chomsky does not acknowledge the fact that there is a direct relation between radical beliefs and wrong/immoral deeds/policies.   My personal critique of Harris is that he does not provide a pragmatic solution to problems, and his ideas just seem to further alienate/antagonize people of certain sects/religions, Islam in particular. Though Harris is extremely careful about his wording, one can easily see the ill intention behind the flowery rhetoric.   Here's Chomsky opinion on this whole ""New atheist"" movement :  http://old.richarddawkins.net/discussions/616576-noam-chomsky-on-new-atheists  http://attackthesystem.com/2012/03/11/noam-chomsky-on-the-new-atheism/"
chomsky,346q0h,Azsu,3,Mon May 11 01:45:42 2015 UTC,"I thought I'd share a comment I made on intent a while back.  ""I've often thought that the whole collateral damage thing is a moral dodge. In intention, it can be said to be different, so for the perpetrators it is reassuring to say ""we didn't intend to kill civilians"". But, where I differ is that I see, for example the bombing of Baghdad in 2003, as an action that had the certain consequence of causing said deaths. The perpetrators didn't target civilians, but they knew that civilians would die, and will often admit as much. Drone strikes are no different in that regard. They might not target civilians but there is no doubt that civilians will die when the attacks are ordered. I doubt a terrorist targeting a US military installation with an RPG attack that kills bystanders would benefit from the same moral protection we in the West enjoy. We stick a uniform on death and call it legitimate.""  In other words, I feel the intention thing is often just claiming ownership of the perceived positive outcomes of an action while dismissing or disowning the negative consequences, using the authority of state power as the leverage to put across the viewpoint without appropriate critical analysis. I'm sure states could justify any criminal act using the ""we didn't intend evil"" excuse, but it doesn't make the justification right from an objective moral standpoint.  On a more personal note I think Harris musings on international politics are really just an outcrop of his extreme atheist beliefs. If this was a purely political movement I doubt he would be so vocal."

Also, nobody in that thread was able to describe what the goals of the US were in their bombings of innocents that made their actions more noble than the actions of others.

Assessments of morality based on the intentions of the actor has plenty of pitfalls, as you mentioned what were the intentions? In lieu of mind reading machines I think another method is probably more prudent. I know in Australian law the question isn't, ""Did the person intend to cause harm?"", instead the question is, ""Is it reasonably foreseeable that the actions taken could cause harm?"". For example, you may like walking in crowded spaces swinging a sword with no malice towards anyone. If you were to harm someone you would absolutely be held accountable because apparently you make really poor decisions.  Never mind the ability for just about anyone to be convinced of their own moral integrity. Their crime then is usually a lack of honest self-assessment of their actions.

I think you're right that he says a lot of the ""obvious"" things you can find on any youtube channel, but given the people he has debated some of those things bear mention. I also think he's eloquent/sharp-witted in a way that often makes his way of saying those things more poignant/enlightening than others. He's also pretty funny.  I think accessibility is definitely also a factor. I may not be representative of other of his ""fans"", but I frankly feel lost when reading ""pure"" philosophy treatises; they feel a bit ""inside baseball"" for me. The same goes for a lot of other political/moral writers; I find Harris' writing style approachable in a way that I find a lot of other writers not to be (I feel the same about Chomsky). This is to say nothing about my feelings about his conclusions, which I do sometimes disagree with.  Re: leading scholar: I don't know what ""leading scholar"" would mean exactly, but I'll answer as if you are asking genuinely and not to sound like you are tearing him down (I'm not sure): he is probably the most prominent American neuroscientist and likely one of the most well known ""atheist"" writers (a title he likely doesn't want). I'd say if there is a specific thing he is the ""leader"" of (or at least a very prominent figure in), it would probably be morality and free will as they relate to the human brain.

When you try and persuade someone, you're seducing someone to believe something. Chomsky would say you should just give the person the information available and be happy if/when they prove you wrong, because then we all learn something.   Edit: just look up his interview with Lawrence Krauss. He explains this early in the interview. It dates back to Socrates. Socrates simply asked questions and claimed to know absolutely nothing except his own ignorance. The opposite camp was that of the Sophists who taught the art of rhetoric, of persuasion, and Socrates was diametrically opposed to this kind of thought. He, and Chomsky, would say that if you're concerned with persuasion then truth isn't your top priority."

Christianity is not a religion that repudiates human sacrifice. It is a religion that celebrates a single human sacrifice, as though it were effective.  Christianity amounts to the claim that we must love and be loved by a God who approves of the scapegoating, torture, and murder of one man ‚Äì His son, incidentally ‚Äì in compensation for the misbehavior and thought-crimes of all others.

chomsky,33nrf1,comix_corp,7,Tue Apr 28 06:48:18 2015 UTC,"You're simply mistaken. If you have an example, I'm interested in what you think that is.  Here are some policies he supports which are patently not right wing in any sense (notice that just one of these counterexamples refutes your contention): he thinks taxes should be increased on the wealthy, he thinks Israel should never have been created (except to say if we are going to create a state based on a religion no matter what, the Jews needed it most), he is anti-Iraq invasion, pro-women's rights, thinks that we should end the war on drugs (a bit more liberal than most liberals on this count), dispense with legal concern for stem-cell research, he's pro gay rights, and so on, and so forth.  I think I have a general idea of the points you're probably thinking about, so if you want to bring up any specific examples, we can clarify the position on each of these. As far as I know, the only remotely 'right wing' position he holds is on airport profiling, and that is basically 'If we're going to profile (and we should), we should be honest about it; it shouldn't be by race, it should be by behavior, and we needn't waste time and resources on people who clearly aren't terrorists, like granny. Screening should be a mix of randomness and profiling'. Notice that this is a position many many liberals would endorse. (Though I don't think that I do.)"

I was mistaken on the Iraq War point - that was my bad, totally. On Afghanistan and Israel, however, he supports the same policies (as far as I know). He also uncritically supported the killing of Osama Bin Laden.   'If we're going to profile (and we should), we should be honest about it; it shouldn't be by race, it should be by behavior, and we needn't waste time and resources on people who clearly aren't terrorists, like granny. Screening should be a mix of randomness and profiling'   That's nonsense. Why couldn't granny be carrying a bomb? There have been plenty of terrorists who have been old white men.

The reason he gets more attention for his criticism of Islam is because he is undeniable more critical of it than other religions, not because it runs against the meme.   Oh yes it is because it runs against this meme, but you're right to observe that it is part of a complex. The notion that all religions are the same is very related and something Sam gets flak for, for instance.

It seems there's much more inherent moral hazard in the position of Harris, so his arguments should be judged far more critically.  In short, Harris is claiming that US responses were justified and collateral damage was acceptable under the circumstances. Chomsky respond that those claims are unsupportable and callous.

He is not suggesting that the US is justified in breaking the law and using torture, he is making a pretty clear moral argument. It is more of a thought experiment than a suggestion of policy (as is obvious if you read his thoughts on the matter).  If it is not complexity you want, then let me simplify his argument as much as possible.   We currently conduct military actions that can result in death or injuries (that are equally as horrible as torture) of both militants and civilians. We abhor torture, and see it as utter evil. If you think that torture should never be used (due to the terrible injuries/effects it has on its victims), then you should not be able to justify military actions that result in similar or worse consequences of militants or civilians. Obviously the reverse is true, if you think that military actions that have these terrible consequences are justifiable, then it seems silly to place torture on a special pedestal as particularly unethical, when we know that other military actions have similar or worse consequences. The only difference between the two is that one doesn't involve the deliberate infliction of physical or mental trauma, but given that it is a certain outcome throughout an extended conflict, this doesn't seem like a compelling argument.   I know you are using hyperbole, and perhaps you're aware of this too, but if you could link a single sentence in his article that suggests he justifies torture based on ""extreme jihadist belief that the US is exceptional and above the law"" I would be genuinely interested."

Saying that Chomsky agrees with you, when he himself doesn't post any evidence on the matter is just circular. I'm not deliberately being argumentative, but either state your views and justify them, or don't make them.  Here is an except from Harris, demonstating his clear support of turture: ""It is important to point out that my argument for the restricted use of torture does not make travesties like Abu Ghraib look any less sadistic or stupid.  I considered our mistreatment of prisoners at Abu Ghraib to be patently unethical.  I also think it was one of the most damaging blunders to occur in the last century of U.S. foreign policy. Nor have I ever seen the wisdom or necessity of denying proper legal counsel (and access to evidence) to prisoners held at Guantanamo Bay. Indeed, I consider much of what occurred under Bush and Cheney‚Äîthe routine abuse of ordinary prisoners, the practice of ‚Äúextraordinary rendition,‚Äù etc.‚Äîto be a terrible stain upon the conscience of our nation."" The fact that you argue that he is pro-torture, means you either haven't read his work, failed to comprehend it, or are being deliberately facetious.  It seems to me like you dismiss any evidence that doesn't fit into your view about Harris, and while it's unfortunate state of mind to have about anything, here is some additional context if you're interested (which you should be if you're going to post about it).  ""In one section of the book (pp. 192‚àí199), I briefly discuss the ethics of torture and collateral damage in times of war, arguing that collateral damage is worse than torture across the board. Rather than appreciate just how bad I think collateral damage is in ethical terms, some readers have mistakenly concluded that I take a cavalier attitude toward the practice of torture. I do not.""  ""To argue that torture may sometimes be ethically justified is not to argue that it should ever be legal.""  ""I sincerely regret making this argument. Rational discussion about the ethics of torture has proved impossible in almost every case, and my published views have been the gift to my critics and detractors that just keeps on giving: It seems that every few weeks, someone discovers the relevant pages in The End of Faith, or notices what others have said about them, and publicly attacks me for being ‚Äúpro-torture.‚Äù Journalists regularly steer interviews on any subject in this direction‚Äînot so that they can understand my position, or coherently argue against it, but so that readers can be shocked by whatever misleading gloss appears in their final copy. The spectacle of someone not being reflexively and categorically ‚Äúagainst torture‚Äù seems just too good to pass up.""  ""Some people believe that, while collateral damage may be worse than torture, these are independent evils, and one problem does not shed any light upon the other. However, they are not independent, in principle. In fact, it is easy to see how information gained through torture might mitigate the risk of collateral damage. If one found oneself in such a situation, with an apparent choice between torturing a known terrorist and bombing civilians, torturing the terrorist should seem like the more ethical option. And yet, most people‚Äôs intuitions seem to run the other way. In fact, very few critics of the collateral damage argument even acknowledge how strangely asymmetrical our worries about torture and collateral damage are. A conversation about the ethics of torture can scarcely be had, and yet collateral damage is often reported in the context of a ‚Äúsuccessful‚Äù military operation as though it posed no ethical problem whatsoever. The case of Baitullah Mehsud, killed along with 12 others (including his wife and mother in law), is a recent example: had his wife been water-boarded in order to obtain the relevant intelligence, rather than merely annihilated by a missile, we can be sure that the event would have been met by torrents of outrage.""  ""We often drop bombs knowing that innocent people will be killed or horribly injured by them. We target buildings in which combatants are hiding, knowing that noncombatants are also in those buildings, or standing too close to escape destruction. And when innocent people are killed or injured‚Äîwhen children are burned over most of their bodies and live to suffer interminable pain and horrible disfigurement‚Äîour leaders accept this as the cost of doing business in a time of war. Many people oppose specific wars, of course‚Äîlike the war in Iraq‚Äîbut no public figure has been vilified for accepting collateral damage in a war that is deemed just. And yet anyone who would defend the water-boarding a terrorist like Khalid Sheikh Muhammad will reap a whirlwind of public criticism. This makes no moral sense (to me). Again, which is worse, water-boarding a terrorist or killing/maiming him? Which is worse, water-boarding an innocent person or killing/maiming him?  There are journalists who have volunteered to be water-boarded. Where are the journalists who have volunteered to have a 5000 lb bomb dropped on their homes with their families inside? [added 5/1/11]""  Again, I am always open to changing my mind (the whole point of argument), but so far all you have provided is name calling pro-torture, extreme islamaphobe etc, literally linking nothing that he has said, any actions he has committed, or any argument against what I have posted."
chomsky,33nrf1,squanto,-1,Fri Apr 24 16:48:33 2015 UTC,Every one of those quotes is very explicitly pro-torture. I'm not sure what it is you're trying to demonstrate?

I also think it was one of the most damaging blunders to occur in the last century of U.S. foreign policy. Nor have I ever seen the wisdom or necessity of denying proper legal counsel (and access to evidence) to prisoners held at Guantanamo Bay. Indeed, I consider much of what occurred under Bush and Cheney‚Äîthe routine abuse of ordinary prisoners, the practice of ‚Äúextraordinary rendition,‚Äù etc.‚Äîto be a terrible stain upon the conscience of our nation.""  Well if you seriously think that quote is explicitly pro-torture I don't think there's much to argue about anymore. As you seem closed to any serious argument, you should also add that Sam Harris is also pro-rape, so you can add that to your list of hyperbole in future."
chomsky,33nrf1,squanto,-1,Wed Apr 29 23:28:45 2015 UTC,"It seems to me like you're having this conversation as if Harris' having a detailed argument about why he thinks torture is ok in certain circumstances exempts him from being pro-torture. It does not.  Either you are against torture in any context, or you are objectively pro-toruture. Yes, it is that simple. Since you mentioned it, the same could be said for rape. You just don't do it.  edit: I can't spell at 6am"
chomsky,33nrf1,bigguyy4x4,2,Thu Apr 30 03:24:13 2015 UTC,"That is a pretty invalid assertion. Someone isn't 'pro' something, simply because there is any situation in which they support it. It is used as a stance in which  someone who as a whole, or generally, supports something. If I think abortion is unethical and wrong in 99/100 cases, I'm not pro-abortion (but according to your definition I would be).  Even if your use of 'pro' was correct, which it certainly isn't, it still seems disingenuous to label someone as such. He clearly states in the quotes I provided, that torture is unethical, should be illegal, people who use it should be punished, and that the real life examples of America are blights on its record. Yet you seem bent on ignoring all of this.  You seem to constantly ignore the fact that torture as described by Harris is being discussed in the context of a thought experiment, rather than real life examples. Is it ethical to kill someone, if it saves the lives of a billion children? If an individual would never kill anyone in any other situation but in this example, I don't think the most accurate description of that person would be ""pro-murder"", yet according to you, if they are for the killing of a person ""in any context"", then they are objectively pro-murder. I think it should be self-evident what a silly position that is to have.  It seems to me like you refuse to admit that problems aren't actually black and white, and fail to understand that positions can be a lot more nuanced and complicated that a simple pro-anti stance which you seem to zealously give Harris. I would draw you to my first example. Would a fundamental Christian who says abortion is wrong for normal pregnancy, in cases of accident, in cases of child deformity, in cases where it may kill the mother, in most cases of rape, but makes an exception of incest. Would an honest label of this person really be pro-abortion. Would you truly claim, as you have, that ""Either you are against abortion in any context, or you are are objectively pro-abortion. Yes, it is that simple."" Clearly this rhetoric need not seriously be answered, the answer is obvious to anyone having an honest argument."

Your teacher would have to show the opposite, which is impossible.  You can show that under international law, any population under military occupation has a right to resist. That is what Palestinians are doing. Israel is the occupying power. The burden of proof should be on them.   Israel's occupation is illegal under international law. It has been going on for 40+ years with expanded settlements show they are really trying to annex the territory. Why are they building permanent settlements? There is a report by Amnesty International that shows the settlements are illegal. Specifically, mention the wall that Israel built that shows that the territory it is annexing does not have anything to do with defense. I think even the Israeli Supreme Court made a decision showing this.  Secondly, Israeli officials themselves do not believe they are occupying Palestine in order to defend Israel, or at best there are all sorts of other motives.  Maybe you could quote former Israeli officials e.g. Abba Eben, as well as U.S. officials, to show that even the Israelis never believed any such threat existed after 1948. Or other quotes that show that Israel is not acting out of self-defense when, for example, it attacks Gaza every few years.  There are officials that claim the reason is to ""mow the lawn"" e.g. to rally nationalist support, show others in the region it is crazy, or as part of a strategy to antagonize Hamas and use PR to paint them as terrorists and avoid having to negotiate a settlement.  You can read Norman Finkelstein's ""Image and Reality of the Israel-Palestine Conflict"" as well as ""This Time We Went Too Far"" to get the exact quotes/documents, along with much more in-depth info.   Also, cite world opinion as to whether or not Israel has exhausted peaceful means. The entire world outside of the U.S./Israel thinks the peaceful means would entail negotiations and the result being the two-state solution w/Jerusalem going to Palestinians + territory exchange and compensation for Palestinian refugees."

Your professor is dead wrong. Out of curiosity, is he a law professor?  edit: just adding this bit of information that Chomsky has written and spoken about showing Israel's attitude towards Palestine: Also misleading is the question whether the hawkish Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu would accept a ""Palestinian state."" In fact, his administration was the first to countenance this possibility when it came into office in 1996, following Yitzhak Rabin and Shimon Peres, who rejected this outcome. Netanyahu's associate David bar-Illan explained that some areas would be left to Palestinians, and if they wanted to call them ""a state,"" Israel would not object -- or they could call them ""fried chicken."" source: http://www.cnn.com/2013/08/16/opinion/mideast-talks-noam-chomsky/"
chomsky,3399aj,kenjen18,7,Tue Apr 21 18:12:01 2015 UTC,"This would be the relevant section of the UN Charter, which is the law of the land for any nation that is signatory to it, which will include Israel and the United States.  The obvious question to your teacher is who, legally, decides what a ""reasonable threat"" is?  According to the UN Charter it is the Security Council.  Article 51 explains that you legally have a right to repel an armed attack, so if bombs are falling on you you can defend yourself and repel them, but in parallel the Security Council is to convene to determine appropriate action.  Otherwise you are not entitled to use force against another state.  The Security Council has to approve it before it would be legal.  Note here in Article 2 that the threat of force is also illegal, so Netenyahu's statements were flatly illegal.  It's easy to see that when you consider the nations under Soviet domination.  They remained under that domination due to the threat posed by Moscow and everybody in the West recognizes the illegitimacy of that."
chomsky,3399aj,fifteencat,3,Mon Apr 20 21:05:13 2015 UTC,"Ok I researched it for you.  There are 2 main things governing this. No article brings up ""reasonable threats"". Its a modern term thing to justify wars of aggression by claiming actual violence and threats is the solution to theoretical threats. Only the UN requires willingness to peaceful talks.  (1) Customary international law accepted by most every nation to be decided on by the The International Court of Justice states:  The first nation to do any of the following is automatically the aggressor: --Declare War --Invading with armed forces --Using any armed forces to attack territory, vehicles or aircraft --Blocking trade or movement in and out of a territory --Provision of support for rebels or other armed forces in the territory covertly or otherwise. --No exceptions for any reason including economic, political, military or otherwise.  (Israel did almost all of these first from what I have read)    (2) United Nations Articles decided on by the United Nations Council states:    ""Aggression is the use of force by a State or Government against another State or Government, in any manner, whatever the weapons used and whether openly or otherwise, for any reason or for any purpose other than individual or collective self-defence or in pursuance of a decision or recommendation by a competent organ of the United Nations"".    The parties to any dispute, the continuance of which is likely to endanger the maintenance of international peace and security, shall, first of all, seek a solution by negotiation, enquiry, mediation, conciliation, arbitration, judicial settlement, resort to regional agencies or arrangements, or other peaceful means of their own choice. The Security Council shall, when it deems necessary, call upon the parties to settle their dispute by such means.      By default UN would consider ""force when there is a reasonable threat to their sovereign security"" to be an illegal war of aggression. The only way to use force against a nation based of only a purported threat is by a UN resolution and voting.  Imagine if individuals tried to use the same self defense justifications as Israel. ""Im pretty sure this guy is trying to kill me, and I have tracked the suspect to this hospital, so I blew up the hospital and now only a crater filled with bodies is left. Dont worry, I warned the hospital front desk 3 minutes before all those human shields died.""  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_of_aggression http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customary_international_law http://www.worldlii.org/int/other/treaties/LNTSer/1934/95.html  (the Leage of Nations agreement the UN law refers to)"

I think the proper thing to do is to identify all of the people involved in taking on and spending the debt, all people inside Greece or outside to whom any of this money was used, fine them for the amount used, plus interest, plus administrative fees, charge the more serious offenders with serious prison sentences. Collect internally, send the portion of collections that was owed to Germany with the list of people that have transferred their wealth to other countries for Germany and partners to collect themselves.  That, or bankruptcy, followed by serious policy on self-sustainability.

The reason one of these two corporate-state ideologies exist is to keep people coming to the ballot box so that people think that they have some real role in so-called liberal-democratic societies. The majority of people are rendered thoughtless and obedient because they were instructed and constructed to be thoughtless and obedient in that they fostered said obedience to authoritarian structures of dominance and authority in the child so that the adult might never be capable of conscious resistance in the workplace, where he effectively funds the many corporations of illusion so that people might not think about where the $600 dollar iPhone comes from, but rather, look at how shiny it is and so on. Well, the truth is that the established illusions are seen as ""necessary illusions"" by the group of ""cool observers"" who must keep in line the ""bewildered herd."" This is, of course, the liberal intelligentsia's understanding for the maintenance of the status quo. It's rather effective, really, at destroying the rebellious instincts of people to structures of authority and dominance by subjecting them to mindless hours of labor follow by mindless hours of propaganda, only to begin once more. They aren't taught to think any further than that which the authorities want them to think. Hence the efficiency of the ""red scare"" culture in the U.S. in the large amount of people who haven't a fucking clue beyond what the media portrays of radical politics (that is, that communism doesn't work, it is government domination, Stalinism, etc., etc., so that these guys don't challenge the status quo) and their shaping of opinions and thusly the ""manufacture of consent."""

I've recently read The Underground History of American Education where John Taylor Gatto expresses many ideas around the subject of the efforts going into these ""levers and buttons,"" and am about halfway through Manufacturing Consent, but it's always good to learn more and get different source and point of view on the subject. Thanks again."
chomsky,32iom4,audendante,2,Tue Apr 14 04:01:57 2015 UTC,"The many lectures and few films on Noam Chomsky's many waged battles with the propagandism of the mass media can be found on YouTube under the users argusfest and pdxjustice. Alongside this, the documentary, ""Manufacturing Consent: Noam Chomsky and the Media"" is also present for free viewing on the website. However, one can tend to ""lose the forest for the trees,"" as I'm quoting a questioner of Chomsky in one of his lectures, in that we can be absolutely absorbed by such functions of liberal-democratic countries for the maintenance of the status quo, and not even the last resorts (which are the bludgeon through the police force, the national and coast guard, drone strikes, and so on) to which the corporate-state apparatus might use to maintain dominant hegemony over the exploited majority for the service of workingmen to structures of power. The expression of ideological control is made most necessary within so-called ""liberal-democratic"" societies in that it is the rule of ideological management of men which upholds the societal structures insofar as they have lost the ability to bludgeon the society into stupidity and conformity, and must then do this by more covert means.  I'd suggest that you also check out the video ""Education For Obedience"" by Libertarian Socialist Rants on YouTube, and also read the only major publication by the liberal intelligentsia of the Trilateral Commission, a work commonly cited by Noam Chomsky, entitled ""The Crisis of Democracy,"" in which they outline the necessity for the dominance of said aforementioned tools for ideological control and management in that people are made to be susceptible to structures of authoritarian conformity as found in the classroom, early on in life, and the workplace, later on. If you're particular to towing the Marxian party line, as I am, I'd suggest you check out this paper by French Marxist, Louis Althusser, concerning the role of dominant control over ideology in society.  That's pretty much all that I can offer right now. Hopefully, I might be able to offer more in the future. Take care."

chomsky,32iom4,audendante,2,Tue Apr 14 06:08:24 2015 UTC,"Great insight on this topic by both OP and yourself.   Much appreciated.   I've thought about this ""diversion"" concept as well and it's complex. On the one hand, critics of the concept label it as conspiracy nonsense as if some great power is in a dark, secret room coordinating plans to brainwash the public.   That's the goal of the systemic ideological repression of the state: it is in the face of the provision of actual facts (see: the development of the Creel Commission, establishment of the general public relations industry, the fact that corporations own the media and form ideological boundaries, of which the purpose served for ideological diversion from reality before this was primarily religion) that the people dismiss it as ""conspiratorial"" and so on. There's no conspiracy--it's factual. What are the facts? Well, the facts that I can present is that the public-relations industry is effectively a large number of corporations which function, effectively, as propaganda which rouses a cultural implementation of submission to hierarchic and authoritarian bodies which exude control over them. They cannot see the bludgeon that is being brought down upon their heads, because ideology does this. I quote, then, Slavoj  ≈Ωi≈æek, in his latest film, The Pervert's Guide to Ideology.   A few scenes from John Carptenter's They Live, in which the main character, John Nada, tells his friend, Frank Armitage, to either ""put on these glasses, or start eating that trash-can,"" pointing to a dumpster. Slavoj ≈Ωi≈æek appears, saying--   I already am eating from the trash-can all the time. The name of this trash-can is ideology. The material force of ideology makes me not see what I am effectively eating. It is not only our reality which enslaves us. The tragedy of our predicament, when we are within ideology, is that, when we think that we escape it into our dreams, it is at that point that we are within ideology.    You see, the point of ideological control is to hinder the ability of the working-class to see, in reference to the previous metaphor, ""what they are eating."" Ideological control is materialized through the formation of the church, the newspaper, and so on. Their sight, in turn, is obscured by ideology. Ideology is the fundamental driving force by which the ruling classes maintain their hegemonic dominance both domestically and abroad, in that they must first go through the domestic indoctrination insofar as they rouse support by the masses (""the bewildered herd"" lending their weight to support one or the other of the ""cool observers,"" in Chomsky's ""dialectic"") in convincing them that the enemy is the Muslims, or in the case of Nazi Germany, the Jews, or in the case of the Red Scare, the Communists. They effectively drive away the attention of the masses from realizing who the true enemy is: the men and women ruling the world on Wall Street. It is the banker, the corporate-backed state-bureaucrat, the CEO, the manager; in short, the boss, who is our true enemy. Yet, it is in the driving force of ideology that people are effectively unable to understand that this is the enemy. Thus, the political ideology of ultra-leftism, of Communism, of Anarchism, must take hold, to overthrow the current social order. Of course, there are many problems confronting the left, such as organizational tactics, and so on, alongside the fact that many present Communist Parties are split over the most childish of things. The scattered left can be summed up best in the scene of about a minute or two in Monty Python's Life of Brian. I'll let you watch it for yourself.   I want to disagree but I do find the concept of diversion conspiratorial, and somewhat unrealistic because some people are truly happy going to church on Sunday, cheering for their football teams, watching Desperate Housewives, and basically being left alone.   This is the entire point. They are effectively distracted by the football team, stupefied by the church, and propagandized by the television show.   On the other hand, the system of indoctrination is so ingrained in our culture that people aren't even aware of diversion or the more active role that is possible for them to play in society.    If the public becomes conscious, the system will be overthrown. Thus, the tools by which ideology is manifested by the bourgeois ruling classes are maintained, institutionally, to keep them from realizing their true power and their ability to have control over their own lives. The liberal doctrines of the ""bewildered herd"" is both a harrowing truth of their class consciousness, and the functional delusion of said consciousness. They are convinced, much like the Leninists, as Chomsky goes on to say, that they must make decisions for the ""bewildered herd,"" and only convince them that these decisions are by their mandate. Such is liberalism.   I wonder sometimes if every person is born wanting to lead only to be immersed in an institutional structure that rewards submitting to authority and ""good behavior."" And to what extent the powers that be facilitate this societal structure for their personal gain.    This is done through the public schools, man."

You have your belief systems. You have your emotions. To suggest you can somehow make a choice that defies this, is about as reasonable as saying you can make a choice to do something that violates physics, it's the same principle.

Now if you introduce this First Amendment, it means that the government cannot itself restrict the freedom of speech (any further than it already is restricted by non-government forces). That's a negative right. But that amendment doesn't strictly say Congress has to make laws that remove any of the existing systemic restrictions, especially those imposed by private/non-government entities.

chomsky,313r8b,darbyhouston,5,Wed Apr 1 20:12:50 2015 UTC,"Check out his interview with Yarden Katz where he talks about finding the right ""level of abstraction"" for cognitive systems.  There are a series of videos. That's the only thing that comes to mind. http://www.openculture.com/2012/11/noam_chomsky_explains_where_artificial_intelligence_went_wrong_.html"
chomsky,313r8b,0mnus,1 point,Wed Apr 1 23:55:54 2015 UTC,"This is in relation to cognitive science, but he has said that they have the completely wrong approach. He argues that what most of the cognitive scientists are doing is simply collecting massive amounts of data, describing it, and not much more. They are then using this to make claims that he doesn't see as being in line with the actual functionings of our cognitive systems.   He uses artificial intelligence as one example of this. Cognitive scientists know a lot about how certain features of the brain work. This is then used to argue that if only we could replicate those functions artificially that we would then have a proper A.I. He makes the point that this simply misses a deeper, and an extremely important, level of abstraction; probably akin to the ghost in the machine (the latter being my argument, not his).  What it boils down to is this: They're describing how certain cognitive features work, but not why they work.  Oddly enough, this was the exact same problem in linguistics up to the 1950s, after which it changed due to his and Morris Halle's work.

He's an exemplary historian, but I'm still waiting for an explanation as to how a one-state solution can come about.  The simple fact is that Jewish-Israeli turkeys won't vote for Christmas. Both Chomsky and Finkelstein are correct in their assessment in that a one-state solution is premised on the fact that Jewish-Israelis will become a minority overnight in what is their own state. Discussions of Israeli citizenship aside, and the fact that it is an ethnocracy, the state is recognised internationally within certain boundaries and borders. Therefore, it also has the same rights as my home country, Ireland, for example.   Will it eventually be forced to accept the return of some of the Palestinians who were ethnically cleansed, along with their descendants? Yes.   Will it be forced to accept the return of roughly 3 million of them? Absolutely not.   The only way a one-state solution could be imposed, at least as it currently stands, is by force and that would likely end in a regional-wide conflagration.   It will take a generational shift in the attitudes of Israelis if a one-state solution is even to be contemplated, let alone accepted. Such a shift could take place but it takes a long time. Decades at best.  I read the reports on the state of democracy in Israel and such a shift in attitudes is a long way off.   Therefore, if a one-state solution can't be imposed by force, and if it can't or won't be accepted by the Israeli population generally, then it isn't likely to come about, no matter what we want."

There's a divide between European Critical Theory and the North American variant, with the sub leaning heavily to the latter variant. The European variant is associated with the Frankfurt School in Germany and has always combined abstract and theoretical ideas with empirical work of some form.  The North American variant is very different. It includes all the worst parts of social science that you see denigrated often (and rightly so); incomprehensible language, big ideas with little content, etc. There's a heavy reliance on textual analysis (which has been adopted and adapted from English or Literature Studies) and in relying on philosophers who are postmodernists or poststructuralists. This includes the likes of Butler, Foucault, and Zizek as examples of critical theorist philosophers. They wouldn't be considered a critical theorists whatsoever in Europe.

chomsky,2yjn98,Azsu,1 point,Wed Mar 11 08:51:11 2015 UTC,"Yes, linguistics although I'm not an expert in the field so I'll yield to Chomsky in this regard since he refers to his own work as scientific in nature.   I do however use computer science applications from his work such as information theory, natural language processing and parsing. Here is an example of a scientific approach of linguistics originating from MIT.  Modern linguistics as I understand it from the way Chomsky describes it is: when he started in the field the tasks being undertaken were things like documenting a language in ways you might want if you were interested in translating between languages A and B. So once all languages were properly documented linguistics would have been a dead field.  Partially what he did was say that all languages share a common root (an idea he credits to Descartes) based on the shared structure of the brain (he'll often refer to this and similar ideas as a genetic endowment). Then he started asking deeper questions about the nature of language i.e. He doesn't think language's primary purpose is communication but a translation from the medium that the brain uses for thought."
chomsky,2yjn98,Erik_dc,2,Thu Mar 12 06:45:52 2015 UTC,"Yes, linguistics although I'm not an expert in the field so I'll yield to Chomsky in this regard since he refers to his own work as scientific in nature.   It's definitely scientific, though I wouldn't call it STEM. The S in STEM stands for science, sure, but it's science as in ""chemistry, physics, biology"" (the ""hard sciences""). Linguistics is closer to the social sciences. Though it's true that there is some overlap, as you mention computer science applications and such.   Modern linguistics as I understand it from the way Chomsky describes it is: when he started in the field the tasks being undertaken were things like documenting a language in ways you might want if you were interested in translating between languages A and B. So once all languages were properly documented linguistics would have been a dead field.   Hm, haven't heard that description. It's pretty strange. In essence it's true, I think, but it assumes that languages are no longer evolving. It's kind of like saying that social sciences will be finished once all societal tendencies have been properly documented - it's true but the field is always growing so it won't really happen.   Partially what he did was say that all languages share a common root (an idea he credits to Descartes) based on the shared structure of the brain (he'll often refer to this and similar ideas as a genetic endowment).   I'm going into deep waters now, but I don't think that's exactly what he said. It's quite reasonable to assume based on this assumption that it does spring from one original language, but that's not what I've heard Chomsky talk about. What he's talking about is that the basic logic of language is genetically coded, thus the forms that language can take are limited to this genetic coding (thus something like lojban likely wouldn't quite work on a grand scale because it's not how our communication centres work).  From this it's reasonable to deduce that all language has a single origin as well, but likely the first languages would be very primitive and thus not have a huge effect on language as it looks today. Assume the first language got up to a few hundred words before populations split up and started developing languages separately, once the two languages start growing at a faster pace the common heritage will make up a very small fraction.  Again though, deep water. I'm just interested in linguistics as a hobby. I can recommend /r/linguistics and /r/badlinguistics if you're interested too. :-)"
chomsky,2yjn98,Meeso,1 point,Thu Mar 12 08:13:11 2015 UTC,"""chemistry, physics, biology"" (the ""hard sciences"")   (Modern Linguistics) Trying to understand the basis of intelligence and thought is a pretty hard science and sadly we've made very little progress on it.   Hm, haven't heard that description   Have you watched this? It is where I got a number of the things I just mentioned including the part where language is an expression of thought, which is at least part of the focus of the talk. Then this talk complements the previous one where he talks about reasons for progress stalling out due to limitations in our ability to understand things. This might not be exactly science but it is most certainly the philosophy of science which is a mantle that I am very happy that he has taken up.  These talks exemplify what philosophy should be and where science should draw inspiration from.   from one original language   I didn't mean to imply this at any point, can you point to where I inferred this as I would like to clarify what I said. Also, it is pretty clear that Chomsky rejects the strong premise.   Assume the first language got up to a few hundred words before populations split up and started developing languages separately, once the two languages start growing at a faster pace the common heritage will make up a very small fraction.   I think this is the wrong way to think of languages (if you follow Chomsky that is). Language is a reflection of culture as articulated by Humboldt:  The diversity of languages is not a diversity of signs and sounds but a diversity of views of the world."

I got really bad vibes since the first part of the interview and decided to google Ezra Levant.  I am not surprised by his conservative background though I am not sure what that entails in Canadian politics.

chomsky,2xtq92,Imsomniland,1 point,Wed Mar 4 15:42:51 2015 UTC,"Ireland is the one country I've already visited in Europe, so while I loved it I may not go there but I'll let you know if I do, which will be some time this summer."
chomsky,2xtq92,twignewton,2,Wed Mar 4 16:32:57 2015 UTC,Sure thing! Always nice to show people around!
chomsky,2xtq92,Imsomniland,1 point,Wed Mar 4 16:50:09 2015 UTC,"I'm doing all right. That essay sounds really cool. I didn't even know you wrote a blog.  Hey, some folks at /r/anarchism and I are setting up a mailing list at riseup.net: https://lists.riseup.net/www/info/anarchist_list  You're welcome to join us. You don't have to be an anarchist. More colloquial than Reddit, I think."
chomsky,2xtq92,SenseiMike3210,5,Wed Mar 4 18:06:16 2015 UTC,I saw these two at a near abandoned airport terminal waiting to board last year in march (actually exactly a year ago now).   They were sitting close and clearly enjoying just being near to each other. IT WAS UNBEARABLY ADORABLE.

chomsky,2xtq92,twignewton,3,Wed Mar 4 03:33:29 2015 UTC,"I got his signature. He's the only person I have ever asked for a signature from...I felt anything else would be too rude/an intrusion. I asked him if he was Noam Chomsky. He said he was. I said that I was a fan (I think I said something really lame like, ""I really like everything you've ever done"") and I asked if I could get his signature. It's in my diary. I thanked him several times and then left. I felt like I was rude doing that already."
chomsky,2xtq92,TheReadMenace,3,Wed Mar 4 06:32:20 2015 UTC,"Haha, I can relate. When I saw him give a talk at Harvard during Occupy I went up to him and am pretty sure I just babbled incoherently. He was nice though. I asked for a picture with him and he obliged. It was actually pretty funny watching all these anarchist activists from Occupy, decked out in black block garb lining up to take pictures like a bunch of fan girls/boys/non-binary and in general geeking out at meeting Chomsky. He was wicked chill though."
chomsky,2xtq92,fifteencat,2,Thu Mar 5 20:37:34 2015 UTC,... or maybe I'm straight
chomsky,2xtq92,Hootbot,2,Thu Mar 5 20:55:54 2015 UTC,Cool! He probably didn't mind too much.
chomsky,2xtq92,comix_corp,3,Wed Mar 4 06:52:12 2015 UTC,Can't say I expected this. Good for him!
