Have these documented cases of animal cruelty and fraud been brought to the attention of the attorney general's office? If not, why?"
AnimalRights,3e44s9,KlugerHans,2,Tue Jul 21 22:34:04 2015 UTC,Our local news is covering it and I believe the employee who quit her job and brought this to everyone's attention has reported it.
AnimalRights,3e1wx1,anushreesanthosh,0,Tue Jul 21 09:18:53 2015 UTC,"OP: Click on the title to go to my fb page. Blackfish inspired a doodle I drew.   A friend shared a post regarding the spotting of a 103 yr old killer whale ""Granny"", thriving in the wild (as opposed to whales in captivity that die in 20 to 30yrs). The article led me to watch the documentary ""BlackFish"" yesterday.   As a kid, I was a big fan of Free Willy. I have visited Sea World and seen a shamu show too. I remember loving the show, the beautiful black and white mighty whales and I thought the trainers had the best job in the world. Blackfish, was an EYE OPENER!   It revolves around the killer whales and their lives at SeaWorld. They have loving trainers but because of circumstances like being confined in small pools with killer whales of different families, not being able to swim the 100+ miles a day they would in the wild, being trained to perform etc.. it all takes a toll and these otherwise gentle giants, react aggressively among themselves and with their trainers. Several whales and trainers have died because of it.  The documentary touched a chord! While I am a minion and have no decision making authority at SeaWorld. I thought a doodle was in order.. so I can share what I learnt yesterday with family and friends. Do watch Blackfish, tell your friends about it.. and hopefully one day enough ppl know and word spreads to a non-minion, so we can appreciate the beautiful whales for 100 odd years, where they belong.. in the sea! :)"
AnimalRights,3e0vgf,hephaestion2,2,Tue Jul 21 02:28:54 2015 UTC,"I work in wildlife conservation and, while there are a lot of problems I have across the board (rhino horn for ""traditional"" Chinese ""medicine"" etc.), using animals as photo props is one thing that I consider to be really easy to change. To me, it is purely just because people don't think about what they are doing. And I can't blame them. It's so easy to just think of it as an enjoyable experience and not realise the true consequences.   But it is obviously really awful for the animals involved. These animals are kept on chains, often in the hot sun and the trade for the photo-prop trade threatens some species with extinction. They are beaten into submission and rarely properly fed or watered.  And it's not just monkeys. Birds, snakes and tortoises are all abused in the most prominent and famous tourist square in the country. Thus far, the Moroccan government has ignored all of our attempts to contact them but we're still publishing papers and trying to get the word out that this is unacceptable."

AnimalRights,3doxqi,mermlgloop,1 point,Sat Jul 18 01:37:36 2015 UTC,"Not to be a downer, but why does stuff like this get posted? To make people angry? Calls for petitions or action against ongoing cruelty are one thing, but why do we always get news links about some asshole killing a dog or something?  There's nothing that can be done about it, and these links don't rally have anything to do with animal rights, especially if the person is sentenced for this stuff.   Not a criticism on you, OP, just curious why so much of this sub is just random incidents of violence against animals."
AnimalRights,3diuf7,ltsaGiraffe,4,Thu Jul 16 16:56:18 2015 UTC,Um if you come across a case like this ask about the dogs condition maube offer to buy the animal or pay for a lorition of the vet bill. The vet will most likly keep the animal if its being neglected. If all else fails take the damn animal. Its really not uncommon for people to take animals out of bad situations
