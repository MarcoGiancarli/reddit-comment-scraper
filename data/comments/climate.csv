If it's a newspaper article then they will have the information on the study and you can trace it back that way.   The ""current information on science"" is in the 5th IPCC report. It's very accessible reading you don't need a science background. Start with the Synthesis.  Also James Hanson is the gold standard.

So is the idea that warming will cause broad and diffuse obstacles to the global economy, which may be headed for a major fall. He might also have put more attention to the effects of rising warfare in a world like that.   Still, it's probably unlikely that this crisis would lead to McKibben's hippie dream of a peaceful, decentralized global economy of home gardeners and bloggers. Capitalism at scale will probably survive and revive...or the world may indeed decentralize--into poverty, death and constant war. For more on the economic consequences, from actual economists, read William Nordhaus for optimistic scenarios or Nicholas Stern for pessimistic ones (and read Martin Weitzman no matter what)."
climate,3dvxw1,extinction6,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:14:05 2015 UTC,"It looks to me like the book was printed in 2010 and unless it has been updated since then the science is getting a little dated, as climate change has accelerated since then. Bill McKibbens views are spot on in my opinion and while many may think he is alarmist a large methane release in the Arctic may trigger a tipping point that humans cannot survive. The earliest human extinction prediction that I have seen on a graph could occur by the year 2027.  The Arctic sea ice is melting much faster than IPCC projections and unless humans force governments to act, as the sea ice disappears the warmer ocean waters will likely mix down and eventually thaw the permafrost and clathrates which are only 70 meters deep, potentially releasing huge amounts of methane. 1400 gigatons of methane are believed to be frozen in the Siberian shelves offshore.  Perhaps before you spend the time to fact check ""Eaarrth"" you may want to watch one of the most recent and thorough presentations that I have seen, which provides sources and was created by a long term Arctic research scientist Peter Wadhams.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-qdbICw2f8  Ocean acidification is also another 800 lb. gorilla in the room that is seriously affecting the ocean food chains much more seriously now than in 2010.

The uncertainty in climate change isn't our friend.  Is it 0.8m, 2m or 5m ?  We know it will most likely be 0.8m, so we'll stick with that is essentially the IPCC view, rather than some change of 2m, slim chance of 5m, we'll plan for 8m.  We should really be planning for 5m by 2100 and hoping for 0.8m - 2m.  Currently we're not planning for anything really, just reacting eg Miami installing pumps rather than planned evacuation.

On the other hand, she adds, her gut assumption is that temperatures will drop as they did 370 years ago.  The reason, she says, is her belief that the sun is a bigger influence on earthly climate than the effects of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. “I am not convinced with the arguments of the group promoting global warming of an anthropogenic nature,” Zharkova says, adding that she would need to examine more research before she could take a clear stance on anthropogenic climate change.

But the main problem is the original ""Press release"", that said:   Predictions from the model suggest that solar activity will fall by 60 per cent during the 2030s to conditions last seen during the 'mini ice age' that began in 1645.   Wow. Are the PR-Guys over there that stupid? Why on earth didnt they say ""like in the maunder-minimum, that began in 1645""? Or did they go for ""the grand headline"", no matter what?

climate,3d8zjo,Archimid,1 point,Tue Jul 14 22:36:15 2015 UTC,So it's not true but they aren't sure what's going to happen. That's just as misleading as the other articles.
climate,3d8zjo,dirtyapenz,2,Tue Jul 14 20:51:26 2015 UTC,"They might not be able to predict the temperature to three decimal places, but they're completely sure we're not going to get a mini ice age, which is just stupid."
climate,3d8zjo,ItsAConspiracy,1 point,Wed Jul 15 12:04:09 2015 UTC,"Man, I wish I had your confidence in ""they"". There was a little-ice age after the medieval warm period but you say it would be totally stupid for anything like that to ever happen again. At the least it should allow for some more accurate models."
climate,3d8zjo,dirtyapenz,2,Wed Jul 15 12:42:55 2015 UTC,"It's not that I'm confident in ""they,"" it's that the predicted solar variation is very small and the warming from excess greenhouse gases is much larger. If we had the same CO2 level we had in medieval times then sure, bring on the mini ice age."
climate,3d8zjo,ItsAConspiracy,0,Wed Jul 15 13:10:59 2015 UTC,So then yay for global warming which ironically saved millions of people by cancelling a predicted 'little ice age'. And I guess there is no point in my country looking for alternative energy sources (we are mostly hydro) because freezing dams won't be a problem.
climate,3d8zjo,dirtyapenz,-9,Wed Jul 15 20:15:48 2015 UTC,"Well, to say it's not true is a bit premature as you're declaring it wrong without any specific rebuttals showing why their findings are wrong."
climate,3d8zjo,yaschobob,13,Tue Jul 14 17:30:17 2015 UTC,Their actual findings (a prediction of a Maunder Minimum) aren't the problem.  The problem is the leap from 'Maunder Minimum' to 'mini-ice age' - which is neither a part of their findings nor supported by other studies.  See What would happen if the sun fell to Maunder Minimum levels?  tl;dr: Maybe it would shave a decade off the warming trend.
climate,3d8zjo,thoughtso,-3,Tue Jul 14 19:32:31 2015 UTC,Their research says they don't expect it to last for more than 10 years and that it's not that big of a deal in the grand scheme of things. The mini ice-age part talks about Northern Europe; similar events brought extreme cold weather to Northern Europe in the 1600's.
climate,3d8zjo,yaschobob,-4,Tue Jul 14 19:33:47 2015 UTC,"On a side note, their research isn't just about the Maunder minimum. What they believe will happen is more complex than that. I question if you've actually read it."
climate,3d8zjo,yaschobob,3,Tue Jul 14 22:21:22 2015 UTC,"Nobody has actually read it since it's a conference paper and thus not yet published. But everything I've read about it, including interviews with the lead author, indicates that the research only looks at solar cycle conditions—not the climatic impacts of their solar cycle predictions. Have you seen something that says otherwise? :)"
climate,3d8zjo,LasiusAlienus,1 point,Wed Jul 15 01:27:41 2015 UTC,"Yes. The paper doesn't predict an ice age, for starters. What the paper points out though is that the last time this anomaly happened, there was a strong cold trend in Northern Europe. While the anomaly is similar, that anomaly lasted much longer than this one. They only predict 10 years for this one."
climate,3d8zjo,yaschobob,2,Wed Jul 15 01:37:59 2015 UTC,AFAIK the paper isn't the problem.  The problem is that Valentina Zharkova has apparently been doing radio and email interviews suggesting that it will result in a 'mini-ice age' with temps dropping as much as 2C.
climate,3d8zjo,thoughtso,1 point,Wed Jul 15 02:07:53 2015 UTC,"All of that is disjoint to the actual paper.    In the 17th century it led to strong winters and to very cold summers as well. But the Maunder minimum at that time lasted for about five solar cycles, about 50 or 60 years. The upcoming Maunder minimum will be only about three cycles because the sun will quicker pick up activity. Will be cycle 25, 26 and 27 and then the sun will come back again. So we hope it will not be that cold.   Pretty much exactly what I said. She states this in the interview."
climate,3d8zjo,yaschobob,1 point,Wed Jul 15 02:10:17 2015 UTC,"All of that is disjoint to the actual paper.   Yes, it is. It is however what is making the headlines - not the relatively staid 'we think we can predict the solar cycle for the next three cycles' paper."
climate,3d8zjo,thoughtso,1 point,Wed Jul 15 04:14:14 2015 UTC,"None of Zharkova's research infers effects on global climate, and that's the primary problem with the media reports.  How much Zharkova has contributed to the nonsense is debatable.  There is research that analyzes both future effects of a similar drop in sunspot activity this century, and research that analyzes the Maunder Minimum climate period, which coincided with heightened volcanic activity.  http://www.carbonbrief.org/blog/2013/11/solar-activity-and-the-so-called-%E2%80%9Clittle-ice-age%E2%80%9D/"

That’s super-rotation, and it radically alters the entire planet’s climate when it happens.  In some models, this happens in warm climates because the MJO strengthens, creating more Rossby waves. The resulting dynamics lock the climate into a state where the poles are dramatically warmer.  ... the same thing could eventually happen due to human-induced climate change.  ... that isn’t likely to occur in this century,...   Super-rotation could eventually happen. More good news. :("
climate,3d929g,pnewell,3,Tue Jul 14 13:27:53 2015 UTC,"I don't agree with that.  Assuming the authors means dangerous to be inaction on climate change ?  Aside from perhaps Jill Stein and Bernie Sanders (neither having any chnace for the very reason that they want to do something) they'll all ""extremely dangerous"".  To want to shuffle the deck and line up the most dangerous to least dangerous is like saying a 100 t bolder is more dangerous when falling on your head than a 10 t boulder, either way you're screwed...  We know Mr Walkers position, the worst outcome would be people who want action on effective mitigation voting for candidates like Ms Clinton.  They will inevitably be disappointed and we'll get divisiveness amongst those who want action on mitigation, to my mind that's the most dangerous outcome.  Make no mistakes, >80% cuts to CO2e  emissions means a revolution.  No more driving, no more flying, severe cut backs in energy use, meat consumption to be severely curtailed, no meat eating pets (a large dog has the CO2 footprint of an SUV), no cement etc etc  Even doing all of that all we do is kick the can down the road because even ploughing a field releases CH4.  We then have to convince people to not have kids, another few billion won't help.  This will not happen, the majority of people do not agree to any of this, you can see this in their daily action, driving, flying, electricity useage, tax penalties for having children, consumption of goods etc Would Ms Clinton agree ? of course not.  The vast majority of voters are not prepared to accept effective emissions mitigation, until they do, neither will the Politicians they vote for."

Therefore it is open to the imagination and always possible to influence in some way. So yes, it’s hopeless and we’re going all in. The active skeptic gives up the attachment to optimistic hope and simply does what seems called for. There is a deep freedom in that."

But, to clarify my original question, how do we cope? The despair, hopelessness, and seemingly insurmountable challenges of anthropogenic climate change present a complicated mental situation for the concerned citizen of the world. I know we need to not let our hopelessness get in the way, but how as individuals do we get to that point?   Edit: also thanks for the links, and I will be looking into them for some reinforcement!"

I understand the author is coming from the viewpoint of Near Term Extinction, but messages on how to cope that are helpful are along the lines of, ""it may be hopeless, but we still must try,"" or to accept that that is what life has given to us, whereas the message if that essay is ""there is no hope, and no one will ever be able to cope, die while on a mushroom trip."" It's helpful to know that's others feel this hopelessness, but the essay offers no way to move beyond that."

Knowing you have done your best.  You have reduced your personal emissions, you have engaged with family and friends, you only vote for politicians who say they will introduce legislation.  Not being frustrated that you can do it all, be content with that and accept it.  Climate change is a symptom of living unsustainably, like a sore thumb is the result of it being hit by a hammer.  Sustainable living = consumption x population, both multipliers need to be addressed   What else can you do, build some resilience into your home and your life.  We have 50 acres off the grid in rural Australia.  Generate our own solar power, collect rain water in tanks, grow lots of our own fruit and veg, I gave up work and live of my meagre savings, enforced penury limits consumption :)  We're a looong way from having an honest conversation on climate change let alone sustainability.  Even amongst those who want emissions mitigation, there are still people that think electric cars, wind turbines, solar panels and nothing much has to change or that nuclear offers and option.   We have a troika of people aligned against emissions mitigation: deniers, luke warmers and hypocrites (those who want emissions reduction but not for themselves eg they don't reduce their emissions and/or they vote for politicians who won't do anything effective eg the likes of Naomi Klien, your gf and her friend etal))  That's > 90% of the population who don't really give a shit and why we are where we are.  They're going to fly to a meeting in Paris to talk about limiting emissions, that's like fucking for virginity.  We're a loooong way from having an honest conversation about what needs to be done.  tr;dr You can't solve climate change, limit your own emissions, engage with friends and family and vote for politicians with strong climate policies.

Knowledge as in our seemingly voluntary capacity to lower entropy.   3.The will to do it. That's why they say that when there is a will, there is a way.   Humans are very smart and very powerful. We might have the knowledge and energy to save civilization. What we don't have is the will.  The will will become available once the danger is clear and present for enough people.    My hope is that enough people and infrastructure will survive the first wave of change. In that case there is a good chance that the remaining people will be more than willing to make significant lifestyle changes to save their own skin.   To be honest the biggest danger to all life on this planet is war, driven by individual solutions to climate change. If we manage to work together instead of blowing up each other, we will not only survive, we will thrive."

climate,3d75ko,bvanderspoel,4,Tue Jul 14 13:49:30 2015 UTC,"This will be a long post, but lets start with your final question: ""how do you get through the day?""  Over the years I've noticed people are very bad at dealing with uncertainties. Either we feel everything is going to hell, or we feel it will probably be alright, but there's very little in between. But we can not know either for sure, because human knowledge hasn't advanced far enough. So, whenever I feel down and I think civilization will collapse, I tell myself that there's a chance I'm wrong. Every action I take will improve that chance.   Second, I find your story about Jane not at all surprising. When confronted with a frightening message, we can deal with it either by taking action, or trying to forget about it. Apparently Jane's way of dealing with such stress is going on a shopping spree. You can try to prevent this outcome by talking more about how to take action and offering to help her make a change. Once the seriousness of the situation is clear to her, you don't need to continue with the doomsday message. Talk about taking positive action instead.  There's a lot of research on this issue. I got my knowledge from the section ""CONSIDER THE USE OF THREATENING MESSAGES CAREFULLY"" at http://www.cbsm.com/pages/guide/communication:-creating-effective-messages/ but the entire book is well worth reading.  I'll end with a positive note: sometimes societal change can happen remarkably fast. 15 years ago, in my society (the Netherlands) smoking in the home was completely normal. If you were a guest somewhere, you'd ask if it's ok to smoke, but that was normally never refused. Then legislation was passed that banned smoking in public places, including bars. Within 5 years smoking inside a home had become completely unacceptable. Nowadays smokers will go outside to smoke. There was no public campaign to make this happen, it just happened by itself. The pace at which this happened gives me hope that maybe something similar can happen with regard to fossil fuels."

And yeah I haven't read that specific article you linked (though I will), but I used the information I've gained from this chapter in the Oxford Handbook of Climate Change and this CRED report. The story of Jane just seemed to be a good example of how hard it can be sometimes.   I hope you're right about the quick change, although it took political change first. To make a law banning smoking in public places (or burning fossil fuels) their must be sufficient political will (at least in all democratic countries) and to gain political will we need a motivated and active public participating in climate change action. I'm interested in staying motivated to keep fighting to gain that political will.  Thanks for the link too!"
climate,3d75ko,rrohbeck,2,Tue Jul 14 14:01:37 2015 UTC,"Thanks for posting this thread, and for working to stay positive while acknowledging reality. This article about avoiding climate burnout has helped me. As hard as it has been (and still sometimes continues to be) to be aware of ""climate reality"" while being around people from day to day who are disengaged from it, I feel like in some ways I've become a much more mindful and healthy person since I made climate action a personal priority, and am developing a sense of resilience against what's to come. I value my friends and family more deeply now, and make more of an effort to maintain my relationships with them than I used to. I've become more focused on my personal health and well-being, so I can be as efficacious and motivated as I want to be in everything I do.   It also definitely helps to have like-minded and motivated friends who understand what's happening and what's at stake, and sometimes to share morbid gallows humor with them to vent our frustrations.  I've had a bunch of experiences with people like yours with Jane, and as upsetting as some of them were at the time, they have helped me become a better and more patient communicator. Some of those people have, over time, begun to think more deeply about what climate change means for their lives, and to change their habits, and are more receptive to talking about it with me now. Others, of course, haven't changed much and prefer to avoid the topic. I do find that I'm better at sensing how someone is likely to react to the threatening information, and easing them into it without the conversation just falling apart. It's a tough trick to explain the direness of our reality to someone and still give them a sense that there's hope (however limited) for action on the necessary scale (I think this article explains it well), but it's not impossible."

And the divestment movement is creating a generation of students who are defining fossil fuel use as inherently evil.   I read Ishmael years ago as a teenager and was deeply affected, but then sort of forgot about it as I got busy with my studies and working. But more recently as I started paying attention to climate change and participating in activism, my memories of that book were sort of reactivated. We're obviously still a long way from a society that organizes itself according to deep ecology principles, but it's reassuring that that book still retains popularity — one of my young cousins was even assigned it in her high school English class."

As Moore's Law has taught us, technological growth and change that happens exponentially is difficult for us to really grasp because we tend to think linearly.  I don't think it's impossible that we discover or invent something that's disruptive enough that it allows us to turn things around.  At least I hope so."
climate,3d75ko,TeaP0tty,1 point,Tue Jul 14 07:42:04 2015 UTC,"Moore's law:       ""Moore's law"" is the observation that, over the history of computing hardware, the number of transistors in a dense integrated circuit has doubled approximately every two years. The observation is named after Gordon E. Moore, co-founder of Intel and Fairchild Semiconductor, whose 1965 paper described a doubling every year in the number of components per integrated circuit.    In 1975, he revised the forecast doubling time to two years.    His prediction had proven to be accurate, in part because the law now is used in the semiconductor industry to guide long-term planning and to set targets for research and development.  The capabilities of many digital electronic devices are strongly linked to Moore's law: quality-adjusted microprocessor prices,  memory capacity, sensors and even the number and size of pixels in digital cameras.  All of these are improving at roughly exponential rates as well.

Climate scientists do not know the same information as geologists or those specialized in energy. IPCC overestimates how much oil we'll have in the future, we won't have that much, the OPTIMISTIC predictions are that of peak oil in 2030, but that's unlikely.

But he's saying that renewables and storage will improve enough in the next decade that the incentives for developing countries like India will shift completely away from fossil fuels — I hope he turns out to be right.   With renewables already competitive today without subsidy in some markets and the above trends playing out, it is inevitable that before long – maybe a decade – virtually all new electricity generation will be from renewables. Add in the need to be clean – not just for climate change reasons but for local air quality – and the choice developing countries will face will be between large, old, dirty, hard to finance infrastructure that requires heavy government support or small scale, easy to finance, more convenient, popular and clean energy and transport that will get even cheaper over time. Tough choice?  So the very thing that the fossil fuel industry had relied on for its growth – the rapidly expanding need for energy in the developing world – is the very thing that will drive the competition to wipe them out."

These industries are huge and there's a lot of people with money riding on them not failing, and a lot of jobs in them. For instance, my wife has a relative who is retired on her oil royalties and has little in the way of a fallback plan. When this hits, it's going to hit some people -hard-. I don't think it is fair to say that free market forces are the only ones at play here. We're already seeing growing propaganda by dirty energy corporations, and more lobbying spent to change politics in their favour.  I don't want to say these things, let us be clear. I hope they're right. But I think it would be wrong to sit back after reading this and say ""well, they're doomed, good riddance"".

climate,3d4qoj,PMHerper,3,Mon Jul 13 20:57:47 2015 UTC,"It's not enough to be cheaper than coal. All those new coal plants won't reach end of life for 40 years or so, and the investors want their capital paid back. To retire the plants early, you have to be cheaper than the cost of refueling them.  And you have to be that cheap including the storage, overproduction, smart grids, and long distance transmission that you need if you want to run entirely on wind/solar/hydro.  I don't see it happening without either a substantial carbon price or a lucky breakthrough in something like cheap fusion power. I'm not sure which of those two is more difficult."
climate,3d4qoj,yaschobob,4,Tue Jul 14 00:57:54 2015 UTC,"Many industries, for example agriculture, transportation, heavy machinery and steel/cement production, are more than 90% fossil fuel powered.

Corollary: We'll keep burning fossil carbon until the bitter end."
climate,3d4qoj,rrohbeck,7,Tue Jul 14 04:05:55 2015 UTC,Nuclear is a big part of this as it helps keep energy cheap and most CO2 emissions come from coal. I'd it's likely nuclear could be replaced in 50 to 100 years.

climate,3d5lbj,gitacritic,1 point,Mon Jul 13 18:28:13 2015 UTC,It takes 80 calories to melt a gram of ice.  If you think about the molecules that make up the ice then then it takes about 2.710-21 calories to melt each molecule if you estimate there are 31022 molecules in the gram of ice.  Basically this means you don't need to measure the amount of heat fusion in ice but just measure the amount of ice itself.  Simply put the difference between ice and water is that the ice has less energy in its molecules so so the molecular structure (all the H20 molecules sticking together) is a bit stiffer making it solid.
climate,3d5lbj,Burnrate,1 point,Mon Jul 13 19:12:03 2015 UTC,The problem is how does ice really melt. How much of its heat of fusion does it conduct into the inside. (Ice is a good insulator right). So can you simply go by its external melting and assume that each new exposed layer of ice needs another whole 80 calories. Or do you have to suspect that internal ice has already got some heat transferred to it earlier.

The reason I am hopeful is because Obama has already taken action on health care, and that was a big part of Bill Clinton's presidency as well. I think Hilary will want to create a legacy for herself that sets her clearly apart from her husband and from Obama, where she makes clear strides on a issue that doesn't appear to be simply ""following in their footsteps.""  Whereas Obama's experience in the Senate set him up to tackle domestic health care, with Hilary's role as SOS it really makes more sense for her to tackle an international issue, or issues of foreign policy, so climate change fits the bill.   Despite /u/epiphanot's point about her promoting fracking, climate change is a platform issue for Democrats, and I think we can all agree that Hilary will probably stick to the party line if elected. If we get a treaty in Paris this year, we'll probably see mandates for fossil fuels to peak between 2020 and 2030, so there is still room for fracking to play a role leading up to that, so I don't necessarily see her pro-fracking stance to be an issue. Plenty of scientists see natural gas as part of the solution."

""Hoping"" Ms Clinton can is in my opinion delusional bordering on lunancy.  There are other candidates you know will, Sanders and Stein for example.  Ms Clinton is business as usual (similar to Mr Obama) with small tweaks on the side.  If she gets in, it's the death of effective action because those hoping for action will be disillusioned and they will have been complicit in delayed action, yet again, by their dud vote.  I don't think she will win the presidency, a GOP candidate will but in terms of emissions mitigation, either one of those is effectively the same.  We're talking about 85% cuts here by a couple decades if not sooner to be effective.  That needs a revolution."

For example, I agree that I would have preferred a public option with the ACA, but it's still a big step forward. And regardless of whether or not HRC opposes or does not oppose fracking, yes, climate is still a platform issue, and like I said, I still think we can make strides forward in climate even with fracking going on. Natural gas is still a great alternative to coal and oil, that's indisputable.   The fact of the matter is that as a nation, we are unlikely to see climate action happen all at once, in any sort of comprehensive legislation. Environmental activists and policy makers have tried that for decades with extremely limited success. Policy changes almost always happen piecemeal, and it's better than nothing.    won't survive more of the same from current US ""leadership""   Actually, I feel like the executive branch has done a very, very good job using the tools available to them to make progress on climate without the support of Congress. While we can definitely agree that Congress is really hindering progress right now, Obama has made excellent use of executive orders, and the EPA has gotten very creative with reinterpretations of existing legislation. The MATS, Clean Power Plan, and new standards for HDVs are really excellent strides forward. So if current US leadership isn't getting it done right now, what specific solutions would you recommend? What would you have the government do? The public? I'm curious to know what you would suggest, because I imagine that whatever it is you have in mind probably has a number of obstacles and challenges associated, or we'd be doing it already (although maybe for some of the things you're thinking of, we actually already are?).   I'd love to see Bernie Sanders as president, I really would, but I don't think it's going to happen. If it did, he would face the same obstacles that HRC would face in terms of getting an international climate treaty. Yes, the president is a force, but the president is not the government, and the president is not Congress or state governments. While it's also excellent to talk about ousting the entire current US leadership, it's realistically just isn't going to happen, because voters aren't going to make it happen, they're just not. In all likelihood, conservative districts and states will continue to elect conservative representatives and senators, and while we can all hope that swing states will swing left, we have to be prepared to make whatever progress we can in the event that we can't get a Democratic majority in Congress.   Trumpeting our upcoming Mad Max-style doom, pointing to the US' position as a world leader, and saying that scientists are crying out for climate action is all a waste of time. These are things that we both know already. So I'm curious to hear what actual solutions you suggest, and what you would expect or hope to see from either HRC or Bernie Sanders if either of them is elected."
climate,3d1afs,dontforgetpants,2,Mon Jul 13 00:58:00 2015 UTC,"A Hillary Clinton presidency is the most likely outcome, and I'm sure she'll at least continue the types of executive actions that Obama has. Public support already exists for policies that scale up renewable energy, especially as solar becomes even cheaper. I think enough support is building for a fee-and-dividend carbon tax, even among some moderate Republicans, that we might see that policy passed within a year or two of the next presidency. So we'll certainly see progress under a Clinton presidency.  But what we actually need is a WWII-scale mobilization to draw emissions down to net zero within the next decade or two, for a real hope of staying below, or at least not far overshooting, 2°C. That includes, among other things, banning all new fossil fuel infrastructure, massively scaling up renewable (and maybe nuclear) electricity while phasing out coal oil and gas, and Apollo Program-style projects for clean energy, negative emissions technology, and (gulp) maybe even geoengineering.  It will take a fundamental break from incremental politics as usual, and inspiring massive public support to deal directly with the threat of climate disruption in every sector of society, to do all this. It'll mean directly facing down powerful fossil fuel companies and forcing them to accept trillions in losses.   Is Hillary Clinton prepared to spend the political capital necessary to make all this extraordinary stuff happen? Unless she's playing some kind of amazing long game by earning the trust of corporate interests, I'm not convinced that someone who has been such a supporter of fracking and the TPP, and who most often speaks about climate change only to bash Republicans for not believing in it, is interested in doing what's actually necessary."

I definitely think we'll see renewables scale up, especially because a lot of states have upcoming RPS targets they need to hit. I'm in Michigan right now, with a very low RPS... even with a conservative legislature, there is talk of raising it just because it's embarrassing that Michigan's is one of the lowest, and the two big utilities both met their 10% requirements early. So that's a positive.   I agree that we need to see large scale mobilization, but how? This is something I think a lot of people in the industry are talking about. I was at a Q&A with Administrator McCarthy a couple weeks ago, actually it was the day the Pope's encyclical on climate change came out, and we talked about how to bring about large scale mobilization for climate action (even among conservative groups like Catholics) like we've seen in the last few years with LGBT rights. It's hard to equate the two though, because marriage equality has such a profound and immediate impact - with images coming out of adorable couples lining up to get married, it's easy to manipulate people's emotions to wrangle them onto the bandwagon. Even if we passed an international climate treaty tomorrow, there's no immediate effect on anyone's personal lives, so how do we showcase how important it is? It's a tough question. A highly publicized technical Apollo-styel technical program is an interesting idea. Something like Earth Hour comes to mind (I know it's really hard on the grid and wasteful, but something like that can bring awareness to the issue, but I like your idea of something longer lasting, that people can follow along with on the news, etc.   I agree with you of course that I would love to break away from incremental politics, but I feel like I don't see a way forward except incrementally. Even with LGBT rights, it was unfortunately resolved through the Supreme Court, not through Congress as it should be. I think the Clean Power Plan will eventually hold up in court, but I'm afraid that rather than see Congress taking action, we'll see policymakers strategically bringing things through the Courts to interpret/create law.   Tangent... the one upside of seeing change happen more incrementally is that it gives big companies time to react - of course the fossil fuel industry has been studying climate, etc. for years and hasn't taken action - so it's their own excuse if they go bankrupt - but it's not their lowly employees' faults, and the Shells and BPs of the world taking trillions in losses is going to mean ruination of hundreds of thousands of jobs/lives... though of course, more lives will be ruined in the long term if nothing is done.   As for Hillary Clinton, I don't necessarily think that climate action would be her top choice for the focus of her administration, but I think she would grudgingly accept it as her ""cause"" because it's one of the biggest items on the table right now and it's getting riper every year. I'm honestly not too worried about her corporate connections - if she became president, it would be her last job, and once elected (especially on a second term, depending on how things pan out), she wouldn't really be beholden to corporate interests anymore. I (sadly) absolutely have faith in Hilary to choose her own legacy and reputation over any allegiance or agreements she may have with corporate leaders. At any rate, I certainly think we'll have a better shot at climate action with either her or Bernie Sanders over any republican candidate."
climate,3d1afs,dontforgetpants,1 point,Mon Jul 13 06:27:47 2015 UTC,"Thank you for engaging, these are important conversations to have.  I see very limited signs for optimism that the Obama administration is setting up climate change as the defining issue of the next administration — very publicly announcing its policy successes to date as a challenge to Republicans, holding public events about climate change with the likes of Bill Nye and David Attenborough, and strongly linking climate change to bedrock American concerns about jobs, public health, and national security. But he's still touting this goal of 26% emissions reduction by 2025 as if it's a major accomplishment, when it's actually a very low bar. What would actually make a difference is if, in his last year in office, he started speaking frankly about what the next administration actually needs to accomplish.  Re: how we can get to large-scale mobilization, obviously no one has a clear-cut answer, or we'd already be doing it. I think it will take an even more massive and organized grassroots climate movement than what exists now, like what Naomi Klein talks about, with the moral force of the Catholic church and other faith groups that's building after the Pope's encyclical. (This is a good long article about what that might look like.) Ideally it would be paired with a smart, well-funded, and pervasive media campaign supported by recognizable ""mainstream"" sources that communicates the necessity of a rapid, whole-society emergency climate mobilization — not just ""climate action"" — in clear enough terms to counter fossil-fuel propaganda. There's just nobody with a large platform communicating about it as an emergency that requires the U.S. to mobilize as if on a wartime footing. Most public figures are still to various extents ""brightsiding"" the issue, which ultimately de-mobilizes people, when the proposed solutions don't match the necessary scale of action.  If Hillary Clinton, with all her clout and stature as the frontrunner in this race, were to communicate about climate change in starkly honest terms, and inspire Americans to take this on as a national challenge with a rapid timeline to draw down emissions, she would galvanize people. Bernie Sanders is approaching this kind of language, though he is still vague about climate policy and specific timelines (hopefully that changes soon). But I see no signs that Clinton is going to offer anything more than token rhetoric about ""climate action"" while putting off the really necessary hard work. She seems too steeped in the Washington consensus to do otherwise.  I'd love to believe that Hillary Clinton actually is playing a long game with the corporate interests that support her, faking them out by offering deals for free trade and Arctic oil and gas pipelines that are actually meant to fall apart during her administration, and then once she amasses enough power she'll sell out those corporations on behalf of the American people. And then she actually is planning to build a legacy as a new FDR, leading America and the rest of the world through a Green New Deal/WWII-scale climate mobilization/Marshall Plan to fully decarbonize the economy. But even if she does accept climate as her cause (which I expect that she will, out of necessity as you say), I expect that she's more likely to play up the historic FDR comparisons while in reality lowering expectations and still prioritizing ""growth"", pushing the urgent goals of net zero and then negative emissions into the second half of the century.  With all that said, yes of course we have a better shot with her than any Republican — but that's not saying much when scientists are warning of civilizational collapse in a matter of decades unless there's radical action. Whether it's her or Bernie Sanders, it will take a massive popular movement that engages millions of Americans to make real action happen.   Many informed people, including many in this subreddit, are resigned to what one scientist suggested in this article:    ""There's a growing consensus that there must be a shock to the system."" So the darker hopes arise—maybe a particularly furious El Niño or a ""carbon bubble"" where the financial markets realize that renewables have become more scalable and economical, leading to a run on fossil-fuel assets and a ""generational crash"" of the global economy that, through great suffering, buys us more time and forces change.   Hopefully it doesn't come to that, and in any case we can't afford to wait."

So alarming, and upsetting that the science takes so long to catch up when things are moving so fast.   The big outstanding question — and the one that’s most relevant to people living along the coasts — is just how long it could take sea levels to rise to such great heights. The process isn’t linear. It’s currently accelerating and that trend is expected to continue. Dutton said her group is working on new techniques to better define the rates of rise, but other efforts have shown tipping points could cause sudden, rapid rises faster than previous estimates.  “There are some recent modeling efforts that now show you could get a section of the Antarctic ice sheet, several meters worth of sea level rise, to go in a decade.

climate,3csqny,Dave37,-2,Sat Jul 11 01:09:15 2015 UTC,"Where in the report does it say that sea level could raise with 6 meters in a decade? For good reasons I don't trust mainstream media to do an adequate reporting. The article presents a previously upper boundary of 4m/century and states that it might be higher, but not giving a value. I don't see where this ""several meters per decade"" figure comes into play that /u/crackulates is on about. Yes the sea might raise some 6 meters if we hit +2C, we're currently at +0.8C so it's a couple of decades before we even get there, and when we get there it will take a few hundred years before enough ice has melted to raise the oceans by that much. I mean sure the science isn't wrong per say, but the way it's portrayed in this article by Scientific American is appalling and unnecessary alarmist. Unless I'm wrong of course which I'll gladly be proven. :)"
climate,3csqny,Dave37,2,Sat Jul 11 01:08:18 2015 UTC,"Actually the Sci. Am. article if anything does not paint a dire enough picture. I also do not like alarmism, but this new paper based on historical observations is alarming.   the sea might raise some 6 meters if we hit +2C, we're currently at +0.8C so it's a couple of decades before we even get there, and when we get there it will take a few hundred years before enough ice has melted to raise the oceans by that much   The new paper suggests that a 1C rise correlates with 6-9 meters of sea level rise. While we're only at .85C at the moment, 1C is almost certainly baked into the system even if we stopped emitting greenhouse gases today, which is obviously absurd even to suggest.  Again, according to the new paper, a 1-2C change correlates with a 6-13m rise in sea level while a 2-3C change could bring 45m or more. And by the way, the CO2 levels are already at levels correlating to this latter most disastrous scenario.  It's true that we do not know how long it will take to get to 6m or 45m or even if history truly is a guide in this case. However, sea level rise is accelerating so that it's not impossible that many cities will be underwater before the end of the century. It's a signal that we need to employ the precautionary principle.  The new study reminds me of the iconic CO2/methane/temperature correlation figure. In other words, given timelines that humans almost never consider, things may be way worse than our models seem to predict."
climate,3csqny,knowyourbrain,3,Sat Jul 11 14:54:26 2015 UTC,I agree.
climate,3csqny,Dave37,2,Sat Jul 11 15:07:54 2015 UTC,"In my comment above I directly quote the article, in which one of the study co-authors says:   ""There are some recent modeling efforts that now show you could get a section of the Antarctic ice sheet, several meters worth of sea level rise, to go in a decade. We used to think it was centuries.""   She doesn't say 6 meters of sea level rise in one decade, just ""several."" And upon a second reading I see that her quote is ambiguous about whether she thinks in that scenario that sea levels could actually rise several meters within a decade from a collapsed Antarctic ice sheet, or whether enough of the Antarctic ice sheet would collapse in a decade to lock in several meters of future sea level rise. I suspect (and hope) it's the latter, which would give us more time to adapt!  I agree that media should strive to report the best evidence, but given how much more quickly climate impacts already seem to be accelerating than many scientists expected a few years ago, it seems worth reporting when scientists raise the possibility of outliers on the probability curve actually coming to pass. At the rate we're going, shouldn't we prepare for the worst possible risks?  James Hansen has suggested the possibility of 5 meters by 2100, and Paul Beckwith (admittedly an outlier among scientists) suggests 7 meters is possible by 2070. Seeing as how we're currently on track for the IPCC's worst-case scenarios, I'm not comfortable dismissing these extreme projections."

The way I see it, in those  100 years there will be decades where the sea level will rise at nice and steady pace.  But in those 100 years there will also be specific moments where tipping points are reached that will result in instant significant sea level rise.

What I mean by ""alarmist"" is that it isn't made clear that even if/when we reach +1C it doesn't mean that ocean levels will raise 6 meters until then. These are, as you know, dynamic processes and it takes a lot of time for the equilibriums to settle. 6 meter ocean rise will most likely, according to the bulk of science out there, not occur in the coming 50 years and most likely not until after 2100."

An example of this is   a chunk of Greenland or Antarctica breaking off and sliding into the ocean. Think of a cube of ice sliding off a table.

The city of Vancouver, the Pacific Northwest, swaths of BC, Saskatchewan, and other parts of Canada are struggling with unprecedented drought and wildfires. If not for lack of rain, regions are suffering from floods and extreme weather related events. Meanwhile Nestle is trucking our water out of BC for basically nothing. How did we sit back and passively let this happen? Any of this? All of this was largely preventable. We knew fossil fuel emissions would adversely impact our climate decades ago. We had tangible ways of addressing it but were distracted by industry-funded denial groups. And by 'we' I mean 'I'. I feel guilty and ashamed. Even though I live in a small apartment, cycle to work, and bring my own containers to food courts ... I know it's not enough. It's just not enough anymore. It never was.  Firefighters are putting their lives at risk battling these human-caused wildfires. Our oceans are dying.

climate,3cmmeo,AllenIll,1 point,Thu Jul 9 05:45:32 2015 UTC,"Thanks for posting. I've seen increasing support for the Deccan Traps attribution over the last few years as well.   What I've been thinking about for some time—based on various sources—is that Earth in these periods of dramatic climate shifts and volcanism is experiencing tidal forces similar to what happens on Io as it orbits Jupiter.   In Io's case, the tidal forces—or pushing and pulling—are brought about by the gravitational pull exerted on it by Jupiter and the other jovian moons. These continuous forces result in making Io the most volcanically active body in the solar system.   In Earth's case it may be that as CO2 warms the atmosphere—this heat eventually transfers to the crust. Which then results in thermal expansion across the lithosphere. This expansion brings magma up with it and increases volcanic activity. This releases large amounts of sulfur dioxide which quickly cools the atmosphere.   So as the crust is expanding, the atmosphere is contracting and cooling. This then triggers a mechanism similar to what happens on Io through the pushing and pulling of tidal forces acting in a cyclic loop across the surface of the planet. CO2 heats (pulls) Sulphur cools (pushes) in an ever increasing feedback loop. Just as the pushing and pulling heat up the interior of Io, on Earth this may lead to large interior mantle plumes and the formation of large igneous province events like the Deccan Traps.  While in the past the increased CO2 which kicked off such a cycle may have been caused by extremes in the Milankovitch Cycles, this time it may be anthropogenic in origin.   Disclaimer: I'm not a scientist as it relates to these subjects and much of this is pure conjecture on my part. It's just a hypothesis I've pieced together over the years while perusing various sources of information related to the climate, astronomy, and geology.   Edit: Added detail about Io and large igneous province events."

There may eventually be changes along the Continental shelf due to pressure changes brought on by mass shift (SLR).   Thanks for your considered response. It seems that the interaction between the oceans and the lithosphere is poorly understood relative to the oceans and climate due to the lack of observations from what I've seen and read. Many of the beliefs that are given deference are based on inference and not on prolonged and detailed observational records.   Just as much of the oceans themselves are unexplored in any great detail, so too is the relationship between the crust and those oceans—as many of the conditions in these environments make it a difficult and expensive task. This strikes me as a glaring blind spot in trying to get an informed grasp on the interaction between the climate, oceans, and crust.  Also, you have to wonder if there is observational bias in believing that it is just the continental edges that are likely to be effected by pressure changes. Especially due to the fact that these regions are the easiest and cheapest to observe.  There was a concise and simplified explanation of some of this on the NewsHour the other night:  The challenges of wiring up an undersea volcano.

I know that from 2009-2012 there was a drop in the number of eddies spotted by vessels in the north Atlantic, but they stopped counted them I think.  Another problem with eddies is that they have the ability to accumulate a lot of nutrients from the surrounding waters, and kind of turn into an all you can eat buffet for algae. That is all I know.  I think I found the data about decreasing eddies on The Arctic Sea Ice Forum.  They have an insane amount of saved conversations with links to data still up from years past.

I don't know much about the topic at this stage, but will look at the links.   And why can't eddies be counted by satellite (cloud cover?) Eddies are usually of long duration, so the satellite has multiple chances."

The second estimate, considered more realistic, is well within the most recent estimates reported by the fifth assessment report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).

Say hi to your cult leader Ran. ...............................................................    Carbon cycle feedbacks and the worst-case greenhouse gas pathway Posted on 7 July 2015 by Andy Skuce  The worst-case emissions pathway, RCP8.5, is a scenario that burns a huge amount of fossil fuels, especially coal. The model has sometimes been criticized as implausible because of its huge resource consumption and emissions of ~1700 billion tonnes of carbon (GtC) over the century. Those emissions are based in part on carbon cycle model assumptions, which recent work suggests may be too optimistic. New research shows that future plant growth may be restricted by nutrient availability, turning the land carbon sink into a source. Also, permafrost feedbacks (not considered in IPCC CMIP5 models) may also add significant emissions to the atmosphere under the RCP8.5 pathway. In addition, the latest research on the Amazon Basin reveals that the tropical forest carbon sinks may already be diminishing there. Together, these feedbacks suggest that the greenhouse gas concentrations in the RCP8.5 case could be achieved with ~400 GtC smaller human emissions, making the RCP8.5 worst-case scenario more plausible.  ....................................................             http://www.skepticalscience.com/CCFBRCP85.html"

If true you might take a look @ the NASA or http://www.noaa.gov/climate.html. Interglacial periods are one thing.  This is different, this is anthropogenic ( co2 ) forced climate change. The planet has never before been subjected to a disruption of climate caused by it's inhabitants. Frankly we have know idea exactly what is going to happen, only that this is going to have a rather dramatic effect on the Earths climate.     Young people read these papers and are scared.    If they area reading scientific peer reviewed papers, not the nonsense in the tabloids, it's the truth and if it scares them it needs to be explained in a rational way so they understand it.  This has nothing to do with religion or politics, just science and understanding.  Trust me on this one, co2 is the problem and were burning 91.4 million barrels of oil a day.  Along with enormous amounts of coal and natural gas, we are overloading the planets atmosphere with co2 and it's causing climate disruption to the point where we -humans- are going to have an increasingly difficult time adjusting to the changing climate.

For as long as there is still sea ice to melt, the Arctic Ocean will remain relatively cool, in spite of the ever increasing solar heat entering the Arctic ocean due to ever decreasing ice cover. When the sea ice is gone in the summer, as early as the latter part of this decade, the Arctic Ocean’s temperature will steeply rise, and when it does, so will the global mean temperature, and all hell will break lose (sic).”  Between now and then, the Arctic Ocean continues to warm up. Some parts are warming faster than others, and ice is still providing a tremendous cooling impact where it persists.   Then he talks about how shallow the East Siberian Arctic Shelf is, of Shakhova's prediction of an abrupt 50Gt methane release, and of local hydroxyl depletion.

climate,3bidia,DonManuel,2,Mon Jun 29 13:53:33 2015 UTC,"in case you have problems loading the page:   The research, which was conducted in collaboration with Stanford University and the University of California at Davis, shows variability in the increase of greenhouse gas impacts, depending on the type of extraction and refining methods. But generally speaking, fuel extracted and refined from Canadian oil sands will release approximately 20 percent more carbon into the atmosphere over its lifetime than fuel from conventional domestic crude sources.  “This is important information about the greenhouse gas impact of this oil source, and this is the first time it has been made available at this level of fidelity,” said Hao Cai, the Argonne researcher who led the study. “Canadian oil sands accounted for about nine percent of the total crude processed in U.S. refineries in 2013, but that percentage is projected to rise to 14 percent in 2020.”  Argonne is a recognized global leader in analyzing the environmental impacts of transportation fuels, ranging from conventional gasoline to biofuels to electricity and hydrogen. The laboratory’s Greenhouse gases, Regulated Emissions, and Energy use in Transportation (GREET) model is the premier tool for analyzing the environmental footprints of fuels and vehicle technologies. GREET looks at all of the energy inputs for a given fuel pathway, from extraction to transportation, refining and combustion, to determine the full life-cycle energy and emissions impacts.  Cai and his fellow researchers used a life-cycle approach, gathering publicly-available data on 27 large Canadian oil sands production facilities. The study found the additional carbon impacts of Canadian oil sands related primarily to the energy required for extraction and refining, methane emissions from tailing ponds and carbon emissions from land disturbance of oil sands field operations.  Canadian oil sands are extracted using two processes, both of which are energy-intensive. Oil close to the surface can be mined, but still must be heated to separate the oil from the sand. Deeper sources of oil are extracted in situ, requiring even more energy when steam is injected underground, heating the oil to the point it can be pumped to the surface. The extracted oil product, known as bitumen, can be moved as is to refineries in the United States, or refined on site to upgraded synthetic crude, depending on the requirements of the destination refinery.  A new study by Argonne analyzes the life-cycle carbon impacts of fuels derived from Canadian oil sands. The study was conducted by, from left, senior scientist and group lead Michael Wang, principal investigator Hao Cai, energy systems analyst Jeongwoo Han, and life-cycle analysis team lead Amgad Elgowainy (not pictured).  Photo credit: Mark Lopez Generally speaking, the carbon intensity of the fuel is higher for oil extracted in situ and for oil that is refined to synthetic crude. Depending on the extraction technologies (surface mining vs. in situ) and oil sands products (bitumen vs. synthetic crude oil), the carbon intensity of finished gasoline can vary from 8-24 percent higher than that from conventional U.S. crudes.  The Argonne study is the most in-depth look at the carbon impacts of Canadian oil sands ever conducted. It is part of the laboratory’s ongoing effort to characterize the environmental impacts of all types of transportation fuels.  “It was common knowledge that Canadian oil sand extraction was energy intensive, but no study was able to quantify that intensity with this level of detail and certainty,” said Michael Wang, Argonne’s leading expert on fuel cycle analysis. “This information will be important for industry and policy makers as they chart a path forward to meet the fuel demands of the U.S., while minimizing the environmental impact of that fuel.”  The research was funded by the Bioenergy Technologies Office and Vehicle Technologies Office within DOE’s Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy.

I hope continued investment in these technologies works, but I'm not holding my breath.  Gates is also interested in geo-engineering fixes, which, at face value sound nice, but upon a deeper dive, many ethical issues arise (e.g. how do  you test large-scale release of particles in a specific location in the stratosphere to help North America than then causes drought across continents in places affected by the intertropical convergence zone that are already suffering from climate change).   There are also other ""billionaire saviors"" like T. Boone Pickens that have panned out to nothing.  Wind and solar tech is cheap enough and plentiful enough to move the entire US economy to renewables by 2035... this is the direction we should be moving, but alas the political will is the issue due to the influence of fossil fuels and their manipulation of democracy.

It means policies that directly regulate how much carbon can be extracted from the earth.

As long as production is increased, little concern is given to whether it is at the cost of future resources or the health of the environment; as long as the clearing of a forest increases production, no one calculates the losses entailed in the desertification of the land, the harm done to biodiversity or the increased pollution. In a word, businesses profit by calculating and paying only a fraction of the costs involved. Yet only when “the economic and social costs of using up shared environmental resources are recognized with transparency and fully borne by those who incur them, not by other peoples or future generations”,[138] can those actions be considered ethical. An instrumental way of reasoning, which provides a purely static analysis of realities in the service of present needs, is at work whether resources are allocated by the market or by state central planning."

The glaringly obvious yet ignored point is that rich world per capita levels of resource consumption and ecological impact are far beyond levels that that are sustainable, or that could be made sustainable by any remotely plausible technical fixes. People, including most of the green ones, do not grasp the magnitude of the overshoot, nor the significance of the change required to solve the big problems.  The problems are being caused primarily by our systems, not our lifestyles although these are far too affluent. It’s not possible to get resource consumption down to one-fifth or one-tenth of present levels, unless we not only shift to a zero growth economic system, but to one with a far lower level of GDP. That means an economy in which there can be no interest paid.  That means we have to scrap the present financial system, and the forces driving innovation, incentive, work and investment, and the quest for greater wealth. It means much more than scrapping capitalism; it means completely abandoning some of the fundamental ideas (like the definition of progress,) and values (such as getting rich) that have driven Western culture for 300 years.

climate,3bbb75,HumanistRuth,4,Sat Jun 27 17:39:44 2015 UTC,"There are currently three major sources of energy: fossil fuels, nuclear power and renewables. With current technology, none of those three will be able to let the human race have electricity forever. However, almost everyone blindly and tacitly assumes that we'll have access to electricity forever. That leads to some really weird lines of reasoning.  For instance, in this article, the author is prepared to sacrifice (among other things) capitalism, representative democracy and globalization. However, he's not willing to sacrifice electricity:    We could still have electricity grids, (...)   Because he assumes electricity, and because he correctly sees that fossil fuels and nuclear won't give us access to electricity forever, he's blind to the fact that renewables won't give us access to electricity forever either. (Some of the issues that hinder renewables are low EROEI, even lower EROEI if you also want electricity when the sun's not shining, a dependence on fossil fuels for creation and a dependence on rare materials.)  Meanwhile, nuclear advocates correctly see that renewables and fossil fuels won't give us access to electricity forever, so they're blind to the faults of nuclear. (Uranium is not unlimited, nuclear has a negative learning curve i.e. becomes more expensive as it's scaled up rather than cheaper, nuclear becomes more and more dangerous as we use more of it rather than safer and nuclear becomes more and more dangerous as the climate becomes more and more disrupted. Finally, a lot of costs from nuclear power are hidden by government guarantees, government waste disposal and government intervention in case of accidents.)  And Shell correctly sees that nuclear and renewables won't give us access to electricity forever, so they're blind to the faults of fossil fuels. (I don't think I need to argue why fossil fuels won't give electricity forever.)  What if we can't have access to electricity forever?"

Firstly increased volcanism is related to climate change by isostatic rebound - rapid removal of an overlying mass allows the crust to rise, which in turn generates more melt through decompression melting. Volcanism, as it relates to climate change, will therefore be localized to regions in which large masses can be rapidly removed, ie. ice-sheets / caps. Toba, had nothing to do with climate change, and it also never 'nearly wiped out the human species' (http://www.pnas.org/content/110/20/8025.abstract). Furthermore, the type of volcanism related to super volcanoes differs from other eruptive styles, as do they all from one another. Lastly, simply because a super volcano has an eruption, it need not be catastrophic (think about Yellowstone for example and the Pitchstone Plateau).   Personally, I think your idea is too far from reality and based on extremely weak connections, if there even any to be made."

My wording generally cuts to the heart of the material (ie. stop beating around the bush with pleasantries and just get to the point already) so it's easy to see why it may come across as being harsh or abrasive.  My qualm with statements such as yours, in general, is that the ratio of reality based factual statements to pure speculation is far too small. This leads can lead to hysteria, fear mongering, and an unrealistic world view. Skewing reality in such a manner helps no one.   In summary, I won't do a full analysis on where wealthy people are conducting property investments, but currently I'm quite skeptical of your conclusion, because it appears as if you have essentially cherry picked the data leading to a confirmation bias in your statement. I previously cleared up the hyperbole regarding Toba, volcanism, and climate change, and that doesn't leave much substance left to your initial comment. Seismic activity is not up by understanding of the implication and statements such as 'The biggest danger of climate change has always been what we don't know' are meaningless as this statement applies to literally, everything; just remove climate change and replace it with anything else.  What you said that I do agree with:  1)... It's starting to look like this has been one of the feedback mechanisms which has lead to many mass extinctions in the past.  Somewhat, as there is a distinct difference in relation to abrupt climate change, and the outpouring of GHG emissions over tens to hundreds of thousands of years (as is the case for the end Permian & the Siberian Traps).     2)...it's looking like this is going to be the warmest year on record...

climate,3b6y6p,fungussa,1 point,Fri Jun 26 16:03:52 2015 UTC,"This is a weak analysis. If we are to view AGW through the lens of a conventional externality, the order of events matters. As a trivial example, if I move next door to a concert venue, I have no legitimate claim against noise pollution at the level that existed at the point of move-in. The person who came second is the one who brought the suffering into existence.  This is relevant to AGW because of 1) the relative time at which populations industrialized and 2) the relative rates of population growth in different groups. Some parts of the world got to CO2-producting industrialization first. Shortly after this, much of the non-industrialized world saw an explosion of population growth, which is projected to continue for much of the coming century. This makes the situation ethically complicated.  If we treat all extant humans as having equal claims, we end up in the awkward situation of creating new damages in proportion to population. During the time of significant AGW forcing (~1950 onward), the population of Africa has increased fivefold, far outpacing the rest of the world. Does the United States now owe five times as much in climate reparations to Africans? That doesn't seem particularly fair.  China is just passing the United States in total CO2 output, but with lower CO2 per capita. This poses some more weird questions. How do we prorate the damages across time? By the end of the century, the U.S. will certainly fall in rank of total damage inflicted. Do we allocate immigration slots based on aggregate emissions discounted by some net-present-value decay function? Or do we use a per-capita adjustment?  The author is assigning the blame disproportionately on the U.S., ignoring the full context to create a deliberately baiting headline."

One of the suggested policies, Contraction and Convergence, which would require developed countries, which have most contributed to the problem of climate change, to reduce their emissions as rapidly as possible (impact on the economy is not grounds to continually harm people of poorer nations). And developing countries, which have least contributed to the problem but also carry the highest risks, would be allowed to increase their emissions, for the short to medium term, so that their basic human rights can be met.

As I indicated, determining one's fair share is problematic. Do we just prorate shares per-capita? Suppose the safe limit for CO2 is 10 units/yr. The world consists of two countries, A and B, with equal populations, who are each allowed 5 units. Country B's population triples during a period where A stays the same. Does country A now surrender 2.5 units, half of their CO2 allotment, by virtue of B reproducing faster, thereby demanding a higher share? This doesn't seem fair either.   impact on the economy is not grounds to continually harm people of poorer nations   Sometimes, it is.

In 1992, 154 nations signed the UNFCCC, and those countries must, at a minimum, carry responsibility for any further emissions since that time. And now there are no countries that do not understand that burning of fossil fuels carries a high risk.        Developing countries have a right to increase their emissions so that their basic human rights can be met (see the UN1948 - Universal Declaration of Human Rights; everyone has the right to life etc.). That being said, all countries have an ethical duty to reduce their emissions as rapidly as possible. Countries have common but differentiated responsibilities. Ethics needs to be at the heart of collective decisions made in apportioning the limited carbon budget; and the ethics of climate change is a highly complex topic.       They lost      All younger and future generations of all nations will lose, to varying degrees, as a direct result of the current burning of fossil fuels.     their consideration is not proportional to their population on a 1:1 basis with ours      There are no ethical grounds on which you could justify your life as being more valuable that the life of someone in a developing country.

climate,3b6005,Huplescat22,3,Fri Jun 26 20:31:10 2015 UTC,"Global warming is now slowing down the circulation of the oceans — with potentially dire consequences     For nearly three decades now, prominent climate scientists have been warning policymakers that salt and heat driven circulation of the world ocean system (called thermohaline — thermo for heat and haline for salt) could be disrupted by cold water outflows from Greenland. There, in the North Atlantic, salty, dense, ocean water issuing from the tropics along the Gulf Stream begins to cool. The heavier water, burdened with salt, sinks to the bottom in the North Atlantic. This sinking, in turn, drives a massive ocean conveyer belt. It delivers colder, oxygenated water to the deep ocean. It dredges less oxygen rich bottom waters to the surface where they can be reinvigorated. And it drives this ocean revitalizing train of currents through every major corner of the world ocean.  A disruption of this ocean water mixing machine would ripple through the world oceans like a gunshot to a vital circulatory organ, reducing oxygen levels throughout the whole ocean system, and greatly reducing the oceans’ ability to support life. It would be a major shift toward a stratified, less life supporting ocean, and one step closer to the nightmare ocean state called a Canfield Ocean (named after its discoverer — Dr. Donald Canfield).  Warmer, salty water cooling and sinking in the North Atlantic is an essential cog in the wheel of this massive ocean water overturning machine. It has also been described (as Dr Box notes in the video above) as the Achilles Heel of global ocean circulation.

I advocate a WW2-style mobilization.   Those positions are mutually exclusive. If you tell people that there's a carbon budget left, then they'll never agree to a WW2-style mobilization. The only way that you might get people to agree to a WW2-style mobilization is by scaring the shit out of them, even if that risks depressing people into inaction.  There are two internally consistent options:    either tell people that there's a carbon budget left and that we should make a small sacrifice now and accept that we'll be fucked but not as fucked as we'll be if we do nothing; or we tell people that there's no budget left, climate change is going to collapse civilization soon under business as usual and we need WW2-style mobilization now. This option has a larger potential upside but you risk alienating the public completely.   edit: here's an analogy.

There's no inherent contradiction with a small carbon budget plus a big mobilization. It seems to me that ""depressing people into action"" is a more logically precarious position.  Importantly, a carbon budget is, by most accounts, consistent with a 2C increase in temperature, and it's always best to portray the science as accurately as possible. The gloomiest predictions are by definition not the most commonly held opinions. The vast majority of scientists still think we have not crossed any major tipping points and that it's still possible to pull back from the precipice (to add yet another analogy).  As HR said 2C is not necessarily a safe level, and I'm sympathetic to that argument, but that's different than saying there's no budget left for 2C. For better or worse 2C is already the agreed upon target.  By discussing a carbon budget as opposed to (or as well as) a target temperature rise, it allows people to understand how dire the situation is because as you work through the numbers it becomes more and more difficult to see how we can get there short of a WWII style mobilization."
climate,3b0c0j,knowyourbrain,1 point,Fri Jun 26 11:21:03 2015 UTC,"There's no inherent contradiction with a small carbon budget plus a big mobilization.   Well okay, it's theoretically possible that if we tell people the exact message we've been telling them for the last twenty years (""climate change is relatively cheap and easy to fix if we act right now""), that this time they'll suddenly and spontaneously demand a WW2-style mobilization out of nowhere. I just think that chance of that happening is incredibly small.  To be fair, ""let's tell people that climate change is quite easy and cheap to fix if we act right now"" sounds like a good idea while ""let's scare the shit out of people"" sounds like a bad idea. I agree. Twenty years ago, pre-Kyoto and pre-An Inconvenient Truth, I'd be all for the former message. However, how long do we need to see that this good idea doesn't work in practice before we try something else?   Importantly, a carbon budget is, by most accounts, consistent with a 2C increase in temperature, and it's always best to portray the science as accurately as possible.    If you want to portray the science as accurately as possible, then it's important to stress that the scientific consensus indicates the best-case scenario rather than the worst-case scenario. Almost no one realizes this, but it's absolutely crucial if you want to understand our predicament. As an example of this, we hear things like ""arctic ice is melting faster than predicted"" all the time, right? How often do you read stories that climate change is not as big a problem as we thought (by credible sources that don't fudge the data)? Those stories exist, but they're rare.  So yes, I agree that the scientific consensus says that there's a carbon budget. However, I interpret that to mean ""in the best-case scenario, there's a carbon budget."" I don't particularly want to gamble on that best-case scenario.  edit: to be clear, I also advocate a WW2-style mobilization. I'm merely disagreeing with the method of convincing people to join."

climate,3au9vp,bligh8,1 point,Tue Jun 23 16:57:48 2015 UTC,"It's obvious that AGW increases the number and size of oxygen minimum zones, as warm water holds less O2 and reduced thermohaline circulation increases stratification. Consider what's happening off the coast of Oregon."
climate,3au9vp,bligh8,2,Tue Jun 23 17:21:51 2015 UTC,"There are semi permanent OMZ naturally occurring around the planet. Certainly reduced circulation would increase these areas.   The major groups of algae are Cyanobacteria, Green Algae, Dinoflagellates, Coccolithophores and Diatom Algae. Increase in input of nitrogen and phosphorus generally causes Cyanobacteria to bloom and this causes Dead Zones. Cyanobacteria are not good food for zooplankton and fish and hence accumulate in water, die, and then decompose. Other algae are consumed and hence do not accumulate to the same extent as Cyanobacteria.  Dead zones can be caused by natural and by anthropogenic factors. Use of chemical fertilizers is considered the major human-related cause of dead zones around the world. Natural causes include coastal upwelling and changes in wind and water circulation patterns. Runoff from sewage, urban land use, and fertilizers can also contribute to eutrophication.  Notable dead zones in the United States include the northern Gulf of Mexico region, surrounding the outfall of the Mississippi River, and the coastal regions of the Pacific Northwest, and the Elizabeth River in Virginia Beach, all of which have been shown to be recurring events over the last several years.  Additionally, natural oceanographic phenomena can cause deoxygenation of parts of the water column. For example, enclosed bodies of water, such as fjords or the Black Sea, have shallow sills at their entrances, causing water to be stagnant there for a long time. The eastern tropical Pacific Ocean and northern Indian Ocean have lowered oxygen concentrations which are thought to be in regions where there is minimal circulation to replace the oxygen that is consumed (e.g. Pickard & Emery 1982, p 47). These areas are also known as oxygen minimum zones (OMZ). In many cases, OMZs are permanent or semipermanent areas.   So it might be fair to consider Human activities are to some extent responsible for these OMZ, and to a lesser degree AGW would be a contributor as well."

To even have a shot we'd have to start cutting back immediately whereas the climate talks in Paris are about 2020 and beyond. Five more years of business as usual will put the 2C goal that much further out of reach.  I think the best way to demonstrate the difficulty of hitting the 2C target is to talk about allocation of the remaining CO2 budget. There are some differences of opinion about what our remaining budget as a world might be but most estimates come in at around 1000 Gt CO2 equivalents. Assuming we turn our land use problems around and ignoring non-anthropogenic methane emissions, that's around 25 years worth of current emissions. That may sound like a lot, but the devil is in the details of who burns what.  If that budget were divided up evenly on a per capita basis, then every man woman and child would have a budget of about 137 tonnes of CO2e. According to business as usual in the United States that would leave only about 7 years worth of emissions before the budget was exhausted. So how can we wait five years to start cutting?   In contrast China would have something like 30 years to exhaust their budget. Many third world countries would have, at current rates, hundreds of years to give up fossil fuels.   Obviously there is no way that emissions can be divided equitably without Western countries taking a big hit economically. And there're even some people who say Western countries should burn less than others because of historical emissions. Add to that the difference between consumption and production emissions, and the problem starts to seem insoluble short of the developing world giving up their chance to develop."

climate,3aq77r,BwanaPC,5,Mon Jun 22 20:56:19 2015 UTC,"It's like this.  Say they have ship readings, but no buoy readings, for 1900-1950.  Then, they start using buoys in 1950, so they have ship and buoy readings from 1950-2000.  They do a few statistical analyses, and voila!  Looks like the ship readings from 1950-2000 are 0.12°C warmer than the buoy readings.  You can then do one of two corrections:   subtract 0.12°C from ship readings add 0.12°C to buoy readings   The problem with #1 is that you're subtracting 0.12°C from the readings between 1950 and 2000, but you also have to subtract them from the readings between 1900 and 1950, in order for you to be comparing apples to apples.  Now, statistically speaking the trendline is going to be the same either way, but subtracting 0.12°C from ship readings pre-1950 is a bit dubious, because you can't confirm that the readings over that time period actually were too warm by 0.12°C.  For all you know, they could have had a warm bias of 0.14°C, or 0.23°C.  They probably didn't, but you can't be sure, because you don't have any buoy readings to compare them against.  So because we know the trendline won't change at all whether we go with #1 or #2, it's a safer bet to adjust according to the difference you can demonstrably verify.  That means we leave the ship readings intact all the way from 1900-2000 and adjust the buoy readings up from 1950-2000 so we're comparing apples to apples."

The result was that buoy data averaged 0.12 degrees C colder than the ships. We also know that the number of buoys has dramatically increased over the last several decades. Adding more colder observations in recent years can't help but add a cool bias to the raw data. What would you recommend we do about it? Leave a known bias in the data or correct the data for the bias? The resulting trend would be the same whether we added 0.12 C to all buoy data or subtracted 0.12 C from all ship data. - source"

In some cases, they have asked the wrong questions. In other cases, they have used tools that were too crude. For instance, calculations performed in 2014 by another team relied upon climate models that did not have sufficient resolution.  In summary, human warming affects weather in two ways.

climate,3aor2c,pseudonym42,12,Mon Jun 22 07:07:19 2015 UTC,"From another perspective, the difference between 300 ppm and 400 ppm is a rise of 33%, but we'll get to that in a minute. The point here is not so much a matter of climate science, but more about dealing with percentage points and math.  Saying that 300 ppm or 400 ppm or the 100 ppm difference is insignificant is similar to tossing away a million dollars you find on the street after arguing that a million dollars is only 0.0000013% of the Earth's GDP and therefore too small to make a difference in your life and not worth your time. Now, comparing a million dollars cash with the Earth's GDP is kinda stupid. I argue that it's also kinda stupid to compare the amount of CO2 in the athmosphere to that of the other gases in there, but unfortunately it's something that's stuck. I prefer using absolute numbers, there are about 2200 Gigatons of CO2 in the atmosphere. Sounds much bigger, right?  For a gas to be able to absorb infrared radiation (i.e. being a greenhouse gas), it needs to have at least 3 atoms. Otherwise it is too small. 99.96% of the atmosphere is:   nitrogen (N2): 78.1% oxygen (O2): 20.9% argon (Ar): 0.9%   neither of which has 3 atoms in its molecular form. The next most common gas is CO2, which has 3 atoms and absorbs infrared radtiation, next is methan (CH4) and so on. To summarize: 400 ppm of CO2 looks ""small"", because the numerical value is dwarfed by other gases which it is bundled together with who have no bearing at all on climate.  Let's try another example: Imagine If you had a Spaceballs-style planetary vacuum cleaner and you could remove particular gases from the atmosphere. You flip on the switch and remove all oxygen, nitrogen and argon from the air. The new Earth's atmosphere now contains about 95% CO2  without adding a single molecule of CO2, just by changing the base from which the percentage points are calculated. This 95%-CO2-air will absorb just as much radiation and be just as balmy as the 0.04%-CO2-air we have now, since none of the removed gases matter for that. We might have trouble breathing however.  Similarly, the atmosphere of Mars is more than 90% CO2, but the greenhouse effect is hardly bigger than on Earth due to the fact that the Mars air is about 100 times less dense than the atmosphere on Earth. Again, this confusion could be avoided by using absolute figures for CO2.  And another example: Instead of quantifying CO2 as 0.04% or 400 ppm of the Earth's atmosphere, it's just as legitimate to say it is 0.0000000037% of the Earth's total mass -- including the core, mantle and so on. ""Legitimate"", because a molecule in the Earth's core has exactly the same effect on climate as a molecule of atmospheric oxygen: none. You've made the number of CO2 look even smaller without removing a single atom! math magic!  In essence, dealing with percentages in this context is tricky. Percentages are always a sub-quantities of other quantities, both of which can be arbitrary.  Hope this might help. (sorry for my English, not a native speaker)"

Twice as much ink causes a much stronger color, even though the total amount is still only a trace relative to water."

climate,3aor2c,DrTreeMan,5,Tue Jun 23 01:13:01 2015 UTC,"The math you're asking about related to the energy balance of the planet- high energy UV radiation comes in to our atmosphere from the sun- some of it is reflected back into space by the atmosphere - most makes it to the surface where is is reflected by various surfaces back toward space - at this point the high energy UV is changed to low energy Infrared (IR) radiation (think of heat radiating off a surface) - The IR is refected back towards space.  CO2 is a greenhouse gas.  A gas is a low-density cluster of particles.  CO2 particles allow UV radiation to pass through, but reflect IR radiation back to earth - hence the greenhouse effect.  So although the absolute numbers are small, when you increase CO2 by 33% (and growing), you're reflecting significantly more heat back towards earth.  Those CO2 particles are not just 1-and-done, they have a half-life of roughly 100 years.  I'm not going to get into the math myself (I'm not really qualified), but this would be a good place for you or your friend to start:  http://www.acs.org/content/acs/en/climatescience/energybalance.html  Also, ask your friend to show that the increase in CO2 that we're seeing DOESN'T have a significant effect.  I don't think the burden of proof necessarily has to be your responsibility- your friend is the one who is questioning accepted science.  What evidence does he/she have for doing so?"
climate,3aor2c,alkalifly,3,Mon Jun 22 14:40:21 2015 UTC,"That is a nice and thorough explanation, but I wanted to correct the use of the word ""reflect"" when it is actually absorption and emission that is taking place. You are correct that some of the incoming shortwave (solar) radiation is reflected by the surface (and some stuff in the atmosphere, particularly clouds), but that reflected radiation then goes out to space without interacting with greenhouse gases. Meanwhile, the portion that is not reflected gets absorbed by the surface, causing the surface to heat up, and as the surface cools, it emits longwave (thermal) radiation.  At this point, greenhouse gases become important, not because they reflect this longwave radiation (they don't), but because they absorb it, and then re-emit. The key is that the greenhouse gases emit in all directions, so while about half of it is sent upwards (toward space), the other half is emitted back down toward the surface (some people use the word ""trapped"" to talk about this portion of the radiation) where it contributes toward warming"

climate,3ahyon,HumanistRuth,3,Sat Jun 20 18:35:13 2015 UTC,That is correct.  The graphic in the article also assumes that global emission go almost flat within 10 years.  That is never going to happen.

The global model also predicted increases in CO2 weakening the amount of carbon sequestered by land-based ecosystems after 2100, though the degree of weakening wasn’t uniform across the planet.  Over the 550 years modeled in the study (1850 to 2300) temperatures increased 9.3 degrees Celsius (16.7 degrees Fahrenheit), and roughly half of that warming happened after 2100. The warming effect was substantially greater at higher latitudes in the Arctic, where temperature rose a whopping 20 C (36 F). [emphasis mine]   They forsee a more than 4.6°C rise in 85 years."

To the 1% the tax is a mere nothing and they have no change to their old ways of polluting.  The ones who have to stop polluting are the poorest, the ones who simply cannot afford to pay the tax.  So what happens is that the wealthy make global warming not their problem and shift the whole burden onto the poor.  Doesn't sound very fair to me.    Add to that that the reason that we've not had a decarbonisation agreement from any of the UN global get togethers over the last many years is because the agreements have not been fair.  The poor third world countries did not create this problem.  Wealthy countries created it - they should at least recognise their responsibility."

Granted, this is perhaps the first Church document to come out and state its stance on global warming and climate change and that it is mostly man-made, but the Vatican has always urged for the protection of Mother Earth.   After all, some refer to Benedict XVI as the first ""green pope"" as he made Vatican City environmentally friendly.

The Earth warms both when fossil fuel carbon is oxidized to carbon dioxide and when greenhouse effect of carbon dioxide inhibits longwave radiation from escaping to space. Various important time scales and ratios comparing these two climate forcings have not previously been quantified. For example, the global and time-integrated radiative forcing from burning a fossil fuel exceeds the heat released upon combustion within 2 months. Over the long lifetime of CO2 in the atmosphere, the cumulative CO2-radiative forcing exceeds the amount of energy released upon combustion by a factor >100,000. For a new power plant, the radiative forcing from the accumulation of released CO2 exceeds the direct thermal emissions in less than half a year. Furthermore, we show that the energy released from the combustion of fossil fuels is now about 1.71% of the radiative forcing from CO2 that has accumulated in the atmosphere as a consequence of historical fossil fuel combustion."

This, to me, shows how bad our human minds are at understanding the scale of climate adjustments.  Mountain glaciers are fucking huge, so AK alone has lost 75 cubic kilometers of water.  Totten glacier, main cause of EAS melt gives us only 70 with a melt area around the size of half of Texas.  Western Antarctic gives us about 150 kilometers cubed of melt.  Greenland is about 367 kilometers cubed of water loss per year.  With a good portion of the glaciers that meet the sea in AK. while not being a exactly like polar glaciers, they can still be used to help understand the dynamics of glacial collapse elsewhere.  To do this we need as much data about these current events to help us better understand if it will be 1 meter of SLR by 2100 or 5-7 meters.  Downplaying the loss of these ecosystems by comparing them to total SLR, to me, would be very similar to watching the Great Lakes dry up over 20 years and saying its no big deal, its just 1% of our total above ground fresh water, (when you add in the ice caps).  I got my #'s from wiki so they do not add back in the winter snow, hence mine are a bit off of the articles.

Glaciers provide stable water delivery systems for river and massive irrigation systems world wide and are not something to be ignored. They are and have been a strong indicator of our changing climate.  The loss of the glaciers at the third pole that feed the Indus river would be considered a planetary tipping point, and possibly at least a partial loss of irrigation water that provides food for 1.3 billion folks.

Powell, director of the National Physical Sciences Consortium, reviewed more than 24,000 peer-reviewed papers on global warming published in 2013 and 2014. Only five reject the reality of rising temperatures or the fact that human emissions are the cause, he found.  The results include work from nearly the entire population of working climate scientists — close to 70,000 scientists, ...

And the situation you're describing is psychologically much easier to deal with because it's something that you can do by yourself, without needing to rely on other people also cooperating. Even so, there's a global obesity epidemic right now despite doctors telling people that there's a pile of evidence indicating that obese folks can and should lose weight. (Yes, I know it's not easy. I used to be obese myself. But most obese people can lose weight.)

It's not politicians we have to convince, it's voters.  We have 13 years or so to be completely off all fossil fuels.  Not start reducing reliance, completely off them. The scale of that change is now impossible.  Here's a sidebar from nobel laureate on cognitive behaviour and our chances   In one strikingly depressing scene in his recent book Don’t Even Think About It, climate change activist George Marshall interviews the Nobel prizewinning psychologist Daniel Kahneman, the leading scholar of cognitive biases, and tries to nudge him into saying that understanding our brains’ limitations will, at the very least, make it easier to overcome them. “I’m not very optimistic about that,” Kahneman replies, despondently sipping tomato soup. “No amount of psychological awareness will overcome people’s reluctance to lower their standard of living. So that’s my bottom line: there is not much hope. I’m thoroughly pessimistic. I’m sorry.”   We can't even convince the people who say they understand or agree with the science and the need for mitigation to mitigate, what chance convincing lukewarmers or deniers ?"

They will be as vulnerable to droughts, floods, heatwaves and sea level rise as anyone else in the world. However, they are disconnected from the world economy. Their economies are not as vulnerable to losing irreplaceable trade partners to the same calamities happening  everywhere else in the world.    My point is, this is not a problem for the poor.

You're probably right that some populations in economically isolated parts of the world won't be affected too much beyond regional climate effects in the short term, but North Korea is kind of an outlier. Most of the world's poor live in South Asia and Africa, regions which will be subject to especially deadly climate effects and are highly integrated into the world economy (especially countries in Africa, whose food resources are already being bought up by richer countries, which will make local populations more susceptible to starvation when shit hits the fan with droughts, etc.)."

More wealth means more resilience and ability to adapt in the short term, while less wealth means much greater threats to survival and subsistence from similar impacts.  Yes, destructive climate impacts are already hitting all over the world, and California is a great example of current impacts in a wealthy part of the world. But if the superdrought there intensifies, doesn't California have more resources at hand to stick it out in the short term? Compare to the poorly governed and resource-poor Sudan and Syria, where similar drought has already led to food crises, state failure, and mass death. As bad as things might get in California in the next year or two, I imagine we have some time yet before it devolves into horrible ""Mad Max""-style scenarios. More radical and systemic water conservation measures, maybe, and citizens relocating to wetter parts of the country because they've had enough.  Or compare Florida and Bangladesh — both face similar geographic threats from rising sea levels, which will mean large-scale displacement of people in a matter of decades, but people in the latter will face far greater challenges in dealing with the dislocation.  Anyway I don't mean to make this a misery contest. As I said, we're all screwed, and all of us will benefit from a massive post-carbon transition ASAP, while it still might make a difference."

Honestly a lot of the time it doesn't even matter what the numbers represent, because you're just doing trend analyses on them.  Having the background in meteorology and instrumentation mostly just helps for interpreting the results.  Like when I see that there's an unexplained seasonal cycle in rain amounts, I happen to know that that's because of how this particular gauge behaves when it freezes.   My research these days focuses on precipitation and working on better datasets that can be used for future research.  I also dabble in 100-yr temperature and precip trends.    Any graduate program these days is going to get you introduced to coding, which is absolutely a must.  I don't know a single person in the field who doesn't use unix-based systems and coding in at least two languages (Python is getting very popular) every day of their careers.

There are practical applications of understanding a ""Green's function"" of climate, ranging from forecasting on medium- to long-range timescales and the analysis of potential atmospheres on exoplanets.   The reality is that the technical background necessary to work in climate - doing lots of high-performance modeling, working with ""Big Data"" problems that would terrify many tech people, and dealing with advanced statistical analyses - makes a newly-minted climate science PhD a hot commodity.

That's done on appropriations bills that set the relative funding distributions for the different directorates at the NSF, as well as the research budgets for DOE, DOT, and others. The actual grant process is merit-based; you can look up all the grants from the NSF that you want on Fastlane.

Most of the people I know that get outdoor-time work in instrumentation, going out to install new weather stations or check on existing ones.    Since most of climate research focuses on analyzing trends in data that have been collected over decades or working with model projections, it means that the data is already there, and there's no need to go out in the field.  And since there's so much of it, that's why it's become so code-intensive.  There's simply too much data to handle in any other way.    As far as schools, it sort of depends on what kind of specialty you're looking into.  If you're interested in precipitation, then I'd look to places like Washington, Colorado State.  If you're more into severe weather, then Texas A&M or Oklahoma.    Granted, this was the state of things when I started grad school a decade ago, and schools are always changing as faculty retire and others get hired.

This website of the Australian Bureau of Meteorology is quite informative, I think. It's probably helpful to look at qualification requirements of jobs so you can target further studies better."
climate,39s2cm,counters,2,Sun Jun 14 10:22:26 2015 UTC,"For starters, it's climate science that you're interested. ""Climatologist"" is a specific job description which is more of a meteorologist position; it involves the analysis of long-term weather trends for applications in hydrology, agriculture, and other things.   Climate science is a technical field. Most of the people entering it at the  Masters level have rigorous backgrounds in physics, mathematics, or chemistry. Many of them come directly from these fields; a few come from meteorology or atmospheric science backgrounds. The field of climate science is dedicated to understand the phenomena of large-scale (in both time and space) structures in the atmosphere and oceans. It's basically applied fluid dynamics, although depending on your sub-field, you may do things related to other disciplines. For instance, I study the physics and chemistry of clouds, but in the context of how changes in the environment (thermodynamics, chemistry, etc) affect the properties of clouds and how those changes can feedback on the larger scale climate system. I do a lot of chemistry, math, and programming - especially algorithm development for building detailed models of the physical system I study, and a lot of statistics for reducing those models to computationally-efficient, approximate forms in order to incorporate them in global models.  I""m guessing you're more interested in climate and society. You should check out the Masters in Climate and Society at Columbia as a starting point, and spread out from there."

(Not having children certainly helps with this.)  3) A fluency in or ability to examine multiple fields as they relate to the questioning rather than being isolated in one specific field and only applying that knowledge (as an economist would do when drawing up solutions to climate change).  4) A pretty much unhealthy obsession with seeking out (at least more) objective truths - unhealthy in that more objective truths are often unpleasant, which makes even the healthiest and sanest people uncomfortable.  5) A constitutional ability to manage those more objective truths without resorting to self-destruction or self-deception.  All of the above, especially the characteristics you listed, filter down the pool of humans to a miniscule percentage of the total population, and the ones in that tiny pool are almost certain to have very little influence on others due to those very same characteristics. My observations of the most 'successful' people in this world is that they almost uniformly display opposite characteristics to this list."

It is true that the effects are on a logarithmic curve (i.e. you need to double CO2 to have warming of ~2 to 4C), but there is no ""saturation"" per se. More CO2 continues to have an effect by reducing the distance before stray IR photons are absorbed, and by increasing the altitude at which this continues to have a significant impact.  It's also false to claim that CO2 becomes ""opaque to the EM spectrum"". CO2 absorbs IR, but remains transparent to visible light and photons in other EM frequencies."

And with the unpredictable rain, mass rain, drought, and super drought, patterns that this kind of sustained seeding can create locally and I am guessing that it will happen mainly near southern hemisphere countries that lack nukes.  It seems that what we need is new materials that can help us use tethered balloons to input materials up to the 20 kilometer range in the atmosphere for this type of solar radiation management.  Add in trade winds making it hard to stay at 20 k and this idea falls apart as well, even thought it is the most practical method for cost and sustaining constant input.  All my hope is currently on 2nd or 3rd generation EM drive lift vehicles.  These should get the cost of putting massive sun shields in place down to a practical level.

Milanković mathematically theorized that variations in eccentricity, axial tilt, and precession of the Earth's orbit determined climatic patterns on Earth through orbital forcing.  The Earth's axis completes one full cycle of precession approximately every 26,000 years. At the same time, the elliptical orbit rotates more slowly. The combined effect of the two precessions leads to a 21,000-year period between the astronomical seasons and the orbit. In addition, the angle between Earth's rotational axis and the normal to the plane of its orbit (obliquity) oscillates between 22.1 and 24.5 degrees on a 41,000-year cycle. It is currently 23.44 degrees and decreasing.  Similar astronomical theories had been advanced in the 19th century by Joseph Adhemar, James Croll and others, but verification was difficult due to the absence of reliably dated evidence and doubts as to exactly which periods were important. Not until the advent of deep-ocean cores and a seminal paper by Hays, Imbrie, and Shackleton, ""Variations in the Earth's Orbit: Pacemaker of the Ice Ages"", in Science (1976)  did the theory attain its present state.

""Retreat in response to increasing marine melting typically exhibits threshold behavior, with little change for forcing below the threshold but a rapid, possibly delayed shift to a reduced state once the threshold is exceeded. For Thwaites Glacier, West Antarctica, the threshold may already have been exceeded, although rapid change may be delayed by centuries, and the reduced state will likely involve loss of most of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet, causing greater than3 m of sea-level rise. Because of shortcomings in physical understanding and available data, uncertainty persists about this threshold and the subsequent rate of change. Although sea-level histories and physical understanding allow the possibility that ice-sheet response could be quite fast, no strong constraints are yet available on the worst-case scenario.""  ""Mercer (1968) cited the geological evidence of West et al. (1960) (incorrectly cited as West & Sparks 1961) showing that “rise in sea level to above present levels took place during the Sangamon Hypsithermal [MIS 5e] and was very rapid,” which “suggests possible catastrophic disintegration of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet at that time, but further evidence is needed.” Above we summarize some of the more recent data on that rise above present levels, but newer data also provide insight on the rate of rise. Other than adding many better-dated and more widely distributed records to the citation list, a follower of Mercer could write the same sentence today.""  ""If Thwaites Glacier experiences a sustained Jakobshavn-type ice-shelf loss and retreats into the central basins beneath the West Antarctic Ice Sheet that reach >2,000 m below sea level, the resulting cliff would almost surely be highly unstable. If any m ́ lange produced were sufficiently weak, the resulting cliff failure might cause the glacier to retreat much more rapidly than simulated by models lacking this process. Pollard et al. (2014) found that a parameterization for this process increased the instability and collapse rate of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet and of marine portions of the East Antarctic Ice Sheet, with this parameterization and the forcing adopted causing West Antarctic Ice Sheet collapse to occur on decadal timescales once initiated. No fully physical model now exists that includes this process, and given the dependence on poorly known fracture mechanics of ice, a quantitatively well-constrained model appears unlikely in the near future.""  ""The geological record, and modeling targeting the modern setting, indicate that Thwaites Glacier will likely exhibit threshold behavior, with retreat off the sill (Figures 2 and 4) triggering much more rapid retreat that likely will be irreversible over human timescales of centuries or less. The stability threshold may already have been crossed, although the few modeling experiments to date do not provide full agreement on that. Whether the threshold has been crossed, and how rapidly the ongoing retreat may leave the stabilizing sill, may depend on processes and conditions that are not yet fully understood and measured, such that future modeling seems likely to leave substantial uncertainty for some time. Notably, retreat into the deep basins could create conditions unlike any seen on Earth today, with processes that generally are not accurately represented in the current generation of models. In particular, the possibility of cliff failure suggests that Thwaites Glacier retreat and West Antarctic Ice Sheet loss could be much faster than generally simulated.""

What country are you in?   instead our pri ministers crushed the working class and increase the number of ""office chairs"", more paper, more bosses around the factory and less workers, who earn far, far less. please comment :)   The history of the attempts to build socialism up to this point has showed us certain mistakes that can be made by both the people and the leadership of a country that successfully overthrows a capitalist regime. It is fortunate that we've learned them, but very unfortunate that so many socialist countries returned to capitalism before they were able to be learned from and implemented.  Here are two of the biggest mistakes:  First, not recognizing the need to practice cultural revolution--that is, to keep the party intimately connected to and accountable to the people. There are many ways this should be practiced, but the core idea at all of them is making sure that the communist party remains proletarian in thinking. One does this by continuously ejecting bourgeois people and thinking out of the party and constantly bringing in new, genuinely proletarian people and ideas. The people's wars occurring in both India and the Philippines right now, for instance, both accept the total necessity of cultural revolution, and if they win we can expect them to make it one of their core principles.  The second major problem is what we would call economism--a focus on developing the economy quickly without paying enough concern to whether or not doing so comes at a cost of too much compromise. Many people see this as the Soviet bloc's main mistake--they allowed too many capitalist elements back in without keeping them in check, and they gradually took over the political structure of the country. This is especially dangerous for a socialist country that is in a world that is predominantly controlled by capitalism. This criticism was made against the Soviet bloc by Mao--and again both the Indian and the Philippine Maoists take this lesson to heart.  Both of these lead to the restoration of capitalism and the loss of worker, peasant, and formerly people's control over the country.  If I had to guess, I would say your country's socialist government made both mistakes, but I would need to hear the specifics to be sure."

So in your country, although a party that called itself socialist had control of parts of the government, first, it was not an actual Marxist socialist party, and second, despite this, the country never stopped being capitalist. In a capitalist country, decisions are made according to what is profitable for those who own most of the property in the country, often in corrupt complicity with whoever manages to get elected.

Not to mention that your first article doesn't really provide any sources for its claims. Full-employment is useless if the workers aren't actually productive, and if they're only guaranteed a pittance. The joke, ""We'll pretend to work as long as they pretend to pay us"", was very common in Stalinist USSR.  And yes, I see Cuba is #44 on that list, which puts them just in the top 25%, but by no means exceptional. And Cuba's primary industry is tourism--tourists with their dirty capitalist money!"
climate,395ifh,Dirkef88,2,Tue Jun 9 21:44:51 2015 UTC,"my point about authoritarian control   Every modern society maintains a form of authoritarian control over someone. The state is always and only a tool of the rule of one class over another class. In a capitalist country, it's the tool of the capitalist class's rule over the working and peasant classes. In socialism, it's the other way around--the worker, peasant, and former oppressed people's government suppresses the capitalist class and its allies--with the goal of abolishing class and thus the need for a state.  There are many capitalist countries today that are just as authoritarian as the USSR was at its worst, and for low-income black and brown people in the United States, it's equally so.  What you're lacking is an analysis of who suffers authoritarian control and when. It isn't nearly as necessary in the capitalist Global North because the citizens here are happy with the spoils their imperialist capitalist governments bring home. It's utterly necessary in the capitalist Global South because the citizens there are at the mercy of their neocolonial governments, who enforce the Global North's ruthless and exploitative imperialism.  But really, instead of waving your hands, why don't you provide some sources (preferably not ones put out by the sworn enemies of the USSR) to prove the existence and singularness of this authoritarianism instead of relying on Cold War-era cliches to make your points for you?   your first article doesn't really provide any sources for its claims.   .. there are in-text citations and a bibliography at the end of it.   Full-employment is useless if the workers aren't actually productive   As the article points out, the USSR was the fourth fastest-growing country in the world for the span of its existence. There's no basis for the claim that it was unproductive.   I see Cuba is #44 on that list, which puts them just in the top 25%   Pretty exceptional for a country that's been blockaded and under siege for its entire independent existence.   Cuba's primary industry is tourism--tourists with their dirty capitalist money!   A good capitalist would acknowledge that the capitalist consumers are getting something for their money or else they wouldn't be paying it. Cuba must be producing something of value, no?  At any rate, tourism is a--or the--major industry for many other developing countries, but Cuba has managed to parlay it into actual gains for the vast majority of people in the country, not just a few wealthy people. That's what the Human Development Index measures.  That it achieved a comparable level of success to Argentina and Chile, two countries that have had massive influxes of foreign capital--the opposite of an embargo and sanctions--indicates that the Cubans' planning has served them far better than remaining at the mercy of imperialist capitalism like their developing-world peers."

climate,395ifh,rondeline,1 point,Tue Jun 9 17:15:42 2015 UTC,"I think you may be at least partially joking, but just in case, here are the problems with that approach, conceptually and practically:  1. Virtually every industry one might use to amass such a fortune depends on worsening the problem, including the web/tech one, which depends on the massive production of electricity, which right now comes primarily from burning fossil fuels.   2. As I implied above, the problem is systemic. You cannot merely ""influence"" capitalism into not being fundamentally ecocidal. It is ecocidal in its innermost nature.  3. There is already an industry trying to do this to some extent--the green power industry. But unfortunately, its goals are just as perverse because they, too, are based on privatized profit and socialized cost. The big names in green power are fine with developing countries burning shit-tons of coal to make the solar panels and turbines that they sell to people in the First World. This is always the form that capitalist development of green technology and power will take: it cannot solve truly global ecological problems.  4. There already are very wealthy people trying to bring about change in climate policies, but:  a. They are vastly outweighed by the other monied interests, which are unified in their desire that economic growth and business as usual continue unabated.  b. They propose solutions that, if carried out, will keep them rich. The only solution that will work is a planned economy, which would disallow the continued existence of these philanthropists' vast personal wealth. Hence, the solutions they propose are useless."

Germany's subsidy schedule lead to massive installation 3-5 years ago. That schedule is now widely recognized to have been too aggressive, especially in light of staggeringly rapidly falling module prices (which price declines were unimaginable when the subsidies were approved). In short, Europe is now dealing with the consequences of the first mover disadvantage.

And just to unnecessarily hammer home the point that this won't avoid +2C: even if they 100% deliver what they promise (which is unlikely), then it's still insufficient. Prof. Kevin Anderson's saying that we need 10%-20% annual CO2 reduction from 2020 onwards to get to +2C. (He's more pessimistic than most because he's not making crazy geoengineering assumptions.)

You think that being ""alarmist"" will depress people into inaction. I think that being ""alarmist"" will shock people out of inaction.   Sorry, but saying it's too late and that we are doomed will not shock people into action. Basic psychology has demonstrated this.

Why do you think people with kids are less likely to be concerned about AGW? Because they refuse to face a hopeless situation. They'd rather lie to themselves than accept there is no hope.

Right now, the IPCC estimates ECS to be between 1.5C and 4.5C. That is worrying, but it's still workable. You're not going to convince anyone to act if you keep claiming that we are doomed. In fact, actual alarmism can become a self-fulfilling prophecy.

If you want CO2 cutback on the scale that we might limit warming to +2C, then that's almost certainly incompatible with economic growth: 1, 2.

Even if you cry carbon taxes as the way forward, or cap and trade in different words, the underpinning mechanisms still have to be technologies to decarbonise.  Carbon taxes are not a fair way to progress as the rich get to still pollute and the poor get to pay to mitgate carbon production.

In early May, instruments at the Mauna Loa Observatory in Hawaii marked a new record: The concentration of carbon dioxide climbed to 400 parts per million for the first time in modern history. The last time researchers believe the carbon dioxide concentration in the atmosphere reached 400 ppm — between 3 and 5 million years ago during the Pliocene— the Earth was about 2 to 5 degrees Celsius warmer than it is today. During that time period, trees overtook the tundra, sprouting right to the edges of the Arctic Ocean, and the seas swelled, pushing ocean levels 65 to 80 feet higher."

This effect does not seems to be making the Hadley cells smaller, does it? I believe polar wind excursions in the south are also becoming larger or are thusfar unaffected, but certainly not smaller.

We completely disregard Jane Fonda's asinine opinions one the subject and instead listen to the experts. We start using fee and dividend carbon pricing at least in some states and then seek to expand if it if successful.  Not one cent goes to the government.  All fees collected are distributed among tax-paying Americans 100 percent.  The combination of higher fuel prices and extra money in the consumers pocket will fund alternative energy development more in quantity and quality than the government ever could. Feasibility of alternative energy is investigated and employed.  We don't just have blind faith that the technology will continue getting cheaper and more efficient forever because the reality is there is a ceiling on both. We send engineers to countries like China and share our hydro-fracking techniques which has made natural gas so cheap in the United States.

Climate is, essentially, long-term/overall regional weather tendencies and atmospheric conditions that are very predictable. Weather is short-term and more/less unpredictable. Climate is saying, ""Seattle's climate is one of high annual rainfall and stable temperatures. Its climate is different from Arizona, whose climate is one of low annual rainfall and great swings in temperature."" Weather is saying, ""It might rain today, maybe tomorrow. It may be sunny in 2 days, temperatures may be X or Y."" In a sense, climate is the amalgamation of observed and likely weather in a region.  Global warming can/does drive changes in climates, thus we get rapid climate change with rapid global warming.

For example, the poll shows more people support limiting CO2 emissions from coal plants (63% vs 36%) and regulating CO2 as a pollutant (74% vs 25%) than believe global warming is mostly caused by human activities (48% vs 35%).  At most, this suggests an incoherence among a minority of Americans, not a majority as seems to be suggested in the title.  Only those in the 35% box, those who do not believe warming caused mostly by human activities, can plausibly be considered inconsistent if they do not oppose regulation or coal limits.  I'd bet the bulk of the 25% of those opposing CO2 regulation would come from the 35% ""skeptics"" camp, rendering the percentage of incoherent view to be fairly small.  Notice there are 17% who didn't support or oppose the scientific consensus.  Those with no strong view on the science may simply be following the precautionary principle.  In their view it might be a good idea to regulate CO2 in case the science is right and one's dubious media sources that say it's a hoax or nothing to worry about are wrong.  It's possible a few in the ""skeptic"" camp might support CO2 reduction, as the question allows them to acknowledge that human activities are causing some global warming.  Certainly, even climate sensitivity on the optimistically low end is cause for action.  This conclusion also does not follow from the data:  ""The public likes directly subsidizing clean energy and directly limiting pollutants, policies that hide costs from consumers. It doesn't like gas taxes or carbon taxes, policies that make costs transparent.""  A refunded carbon tax gains 44% support.  That seems low in isolation, but yet again note the large gray area.  Only 25% oppose.  The opposition is lower than those who oppose clean energy requirements (38%) and the same as those opposing regulating CO2 (25%).   A higher number (31%) simply didn't answer either way on the carbon tax, presumably because they haven't made up their mind and want to know the details.

This may seem a bit silly if you know your Econ 101 since, according to classic economic theory, who bears the burden of the tax is determined by the elasticities of the supply and demand curves. However, research by Jacob Goldin has shown that consumers pay more attention to taxes included in the posted price than those added at the register, which means taxes levied against consumers are less effective at reducing the quantity of the taxed product.

That charge, called a carbon price, is the amount that must be paid for the right to emit one tonne of CO2 into the atmosphere.  Carbon pricing usually takes the form of a carbon tax or a requirement to purchase permits to emit (also called ""allowances"").

It's rising 3 times faster than it was just a few years ago. That's whats alarming about it.   For example from 2000 - 2012, it went from 1855-1880 (delta 35ppb); then from 2012 to 2015, it went from 1880 - 1920 (delta 40 ppb) in 1/3 the time.  CO2 isn't accelerating, it's pretty much on a linear march. So, the real question is what will methane do going forward? Accelerate more? Stay the same? go backward? The data suggests it's getting amplified -  maybe it's from arctic thawing. maybe its from fracking. Who knows. If you use the same math (100X multiplier), and if it's rate keeps going up, then it will displace CO2 in just a few years as the #1 cause of CC.  I'd further like to add that this graph is definitely NOT recording some statistical abberation. It's systematic. And nobody knows exactly why or how. Whatever it is, it's likely not going to go away if we shut down coal plants and put up solar panels. It could be something much more difficult to solve."

To put that in terms of CO2 multiply by 86 (methane is 86 times worse than CO2) and you get 8,600 CO2 equivalent. In the same period from 2000 to 2015, CO2 levels went from 370,000 ppb to 400,000 ppb, or 30,000 ppb CO2-equivilent.  Compare: CO2 = 30,000 PPB increase vs. Methane = 8,600 PPB increase. Which is more significant and worrisome? Furthermore the methane will mostly dissipate after 20 years while the CO2 will last for 100s or thousands of years, so the real difference is much greater than I have shown. If a CO2 molecule lasts for 1000 years vs 20 for methane then CO2 is about 50 times worse then methane, molecule for molecule. And there are orders of magnitudes more CO2 then methane molecules.   That is why most scientists are not overly concerned about the current methane levels in the arctic. It's to be expected that they will be rising some due to the warming, but the current rate of rise is so small compared to what it would take to make a significant dent in the climate that no one is overly worried about it. Obviously we need to keep an eye on it, due to tipping points, but the current rates of rise are not a sign of global apocalypse."
climate,384a1d,Johnny_Walrus,6,Mon Jun 1 20:24:20 2015 UTC,"You're pretending that both CO2 and methane are linear functions and will stay linear. That's not necessarily true.  People are worried that methane is going exponential. If that's true, then 8600 ppb CO2(e) exponential growth might indeed be scarier than 30,000 ppb CO2(e) mostly linear growth (depending on the growth rate, time scale we're looking at, etc). Also, there's a risk of sudden huge methane burst.  Finally, they're not competing, they work together. If stabilizing at +2C is very hard (at best) if you ignore methane, then it will become almost impossible if you add in methane."

climate,384a1d,Johnny_Walrus,0,Tue Jun 2 05:45:18 2015 UTC,"People are worried that methane is going exponential.   But it's not. Look at the graph look at the numbers. It's not even close to going exponential. In the past 15 years it went up 100 ppb out of 1880 -- one half of one percent . 0.05 in 15 years is not ""going exponential"". Yeah there's fear that it could but most of the scientists looking at it say it will take thousands of years for something to happen. The methane bomb has been discredited six ways to Sunday. It's certainly possible and there are a few out there continuing to beat that drum but it's crazy it's like we have a dam with a hole of the size of bus (CO2) and there's this small group over in the corner freaking over over a leak the size of a finger (methane) saying ""but the damn could break"" .. the dam is already broken."
climate,384a1d,FF00A7,2,Tue Jun 2 14:43:44 2015 UTC,"100/1880 = 5.3%, not 0.05%; even using your own math, that 5.3% increase equates to 28% of the increase we've already seen in CO2 (8,600/30,000)=0.28 and the methane has risen just in the last few years. If it keeps up this pace of rise it will just be a few more years (12 years) before methane equals CO2. As it turns out, the methane forcing will not get that high (as high as CO2) because it's a different, much smaller band that is absorbed, so it may only get to be about 40% of the CO2 warming increase - but it's still a lot and worthy of sounding an alarm IMO. Increased methane from a thawing permafrost sounds plausible to me, which would put it into the positive feedback loop category of changes."
climate,384a1d,Temuzjin,1 point,Tue Jun 2 17:26:54 2015 UTC,"Again sorry I got percentage and decimal notation confused. I made a rounding earlier (""a roughly 100 ppb"") but more exactly it should be 22.9% not 28%. Also this is for 15 years not the past few years so it will take longer than 12 years for methane to catch up to CO2 at this rate.  Methane is already in a positive feedback, it's impossible to separate it out from other GHGs in that regard. The only question is speed. The melting tundra and clathrates makes sense in a common sense way but it could be nonsensical in particular with our difficulty dealing in large scale things. Obviously over long periods we have big problems but in the near term (100 years or more) it's not looking like a methane bomb will happen. At this point."

However, I think we can agree on three things:   If methane releases merely keep increasing in a mostly linear fashion like they have in the past, then methane is (far) less scary than CO2. There are scientists (e.g. Archer) who argue that this will likely happen. If methane releases skyrocket soon (which has a probability of >0% and <100% of happening), then it may become really scary. There are scientists (e.g. Shakhova, Wadhams) who argue that this may happen. Regardless of how scary methane is, CO2 is really scary. We shouldn't focus only on methane and completely ignore CO2.

It is interesting how the UK has agreed to pay £17.6B in state aid, to quite a degree by agreeing to pay twice the market rate for electricity at £92.50 per mega watt hour.  Then to get past the state aid rules, the EU changed said rules in October 2014.  Looks to me that Cameron has already had his favours off the EU.    It would appear that the main lessons learned from the nuclear power dance around future reactors in Europe and globally is that they come in years late (if at all) [9 years late for the French EPR] and billions over budget (2x for French EPR €3.3B -> €8B).  And the technical problems that have to be solved to provide safety look pretty hard to do with tight constraints on time and money.  Why not use on-shore wind and solar panels?  Much safer, faster and cheaper, especially if state subsidised.  You could also get that much power off a Severn Barrage, for which modern designs exist which do not require mountain top removal."

What we need is a global grid so that energy from the sunny side of the planet can be moved to the edges going into darkness, experiencing evening.

It's not actually feasible because one location can't really power the whole country, unless it is HUGE. And making a bunch of locations that huge will cost tons of money. It will actually push the cost of energy sky high.   Energy doesn't travel long distances without losses. A global grid would be nice, but there's really no evidence at all that something like that could be done in such a fashion that it would be cheap.

At LEAST let's look with an open mind at a crash program to develop Generation 4 plant designs, which produce trivial waste because they use Thorium instead of Uranium and use their own waste as fuel. Plus, they rely on much safer liquid sodium for coolant, and have been shown that they can't melt down - turn off the system or lose the human operators and the plant quietly, passively and very safely shuts itself down.  We are making a huge mistake by not realizing how much the poor aggregate economic numbers for renewables and energy efficiency are working against us...

On one hand, the claim is misleading at best and I hate not calling out such statements. See e.g. this and this for a description of what we need to do without geoengineering: at best it'll be incredibly hard.  On the other hand, some people usually yell at me for depressing people into inaction if you get too gloomy, and I can certainly see that point of view.   Indeed, Keith’s analogy would make more sense if the consequences of warming were already with us, catastrophic and irreversible, short of dramatic intervention in the climate system.   Let's see. The consequences are here already, check (see California drought, India heat wave, Syria, etc). It's irreversible, check. The only thing left is catastrophic."

But Skuce says it would take thousands of years to destabilize clathrates. Isn't the methane spike more likely to originate in lakes and bogs?   Andy Skuce, an independent geoscience consultant, explains that methane gas trapped in clathrates — cages of water molecules below seabeds and the Arctic permafrost — certainly sound worrisome: they contain more carbon than can be found in the entire atmosphere, and the release of a fraction of one percent of them would double the amount of methane, a greenhouse gas, in the atmosphere. However, he continues, it’s probably going to take a long time, on the order of thousands of years, before the effects of climate change cause the large scale destabilization of the clathrates."

Faith is a dangerous guide, if there's nothing to back up the assumptions.   The heat content of the oceans dwarfs our civilization's energy flows and, although all the economic activities we accomplish result in a staggering 37 billion tons of annual CO2, our one year's economic output is a mere drop in the bucket when you compare to the planetary problem we have created in the past 100 years.

climate,37s1ow,climateone,6,Fri May 29 23:55:14 2015 UTC,"It's obviously incorrect to claim, that the temperature observations of a country can be used determine global surface temperature.     It's equally incorrect to claim, that global surface temperature (which represents a small fraction of the heat absorbed by the Earth) can be used to determine the amount of heat absorbed by the whole Earth, especially since the oceans account for >93% of warming. And the oceans show continued warming, as can be seen by the long term trend of rising sea levels.     ENSO, PDO and AMO only affect the amount of heat transferred between the oceans and atmosphere, and do not affect the overall amount of heat absorbed by the Earth.     The natural factors which contribute to the total amount of heat absorbed by the Earth, are well known, and include Milankovich cycles, volcanic aerosols and solar variability. And science has a very high degree of certainty, that natural variability cannot account for majority of heat that the Earth is absorbing.       Your relative vastly overestimates his knowledge of the subject, and it shows that he's clearly under the influence of the Dunning-Kruger effect."

climate,37s1ow,DVDAallday,1 point,Sat May 30 03:12:47 2015 UTC,"Remember that relatively small increases in ocean temperature correspond to HUGE increases in energy due to the specific heat capacity water and volume of the ocean. If you're trying to measure energy in a system it makes way more sense to use units of energy (Joules) than temperature.  Also a direct point-by-point rebuttal is going to be hard to come by, he's packed a ton of in-depth topics into a short space. Climate patterns such as el nino and the PDO and their relation to climate change is a very active topic of research, but they (in the context greenhouse gas induced warming) aren't super relevant to Earth's energy budget. Your best bet is probably just to ask him a) to explain why increasing greenhouse gases won't effect Earth's energy budget  b) where all this extra observed energy is coming from, if not from greenhouse gases (don't let him say the sun). Hammer him on these two points. At the level of a Facebook debate, that's really all there is to discuss.

I don't think there are models out there that really stress inter-annual variability. Without anthropogenic climate change, we would still have el nino/la nina events which cause some years to be hotter/cooler than others. If we look at a few years we will see that one has more of an effect than the other, but if you look at 20 years they average each other out. It would be like graphing the average daily commute to work (in a city). If you only look at the data for one day in March, there may have been some sporting events that cause traffic or maybe some parade or road closures. If I graph out the data for a week, then there will be some short commute days and some longer commute days, but in the end it will average out.  Check out this gif from the Cosmos episode on climate change.   Also, something to pick at. He says:   The 'ocean ate my heat' argument is mostly concerned with the top 2000 feet, which shows a steady, if miniscule heating...   Think about how long it takes to microwave a teaspoon of water compared to a cup of water. Now imagine heating up the entire upper 2,000 feet of ocean. That's a lot of energy being stored even if it is miniscule. Think about how much energy has been used to heat all of that water up to a measurable amount.  What's crazy to me is that he even admits that there is a steady rise in heat in the upper layers of the ocean. Something that might be worth pointing out:    Tropical cyclones derive their energy from the warm tropical oceans and do not form unless the sea-surface temperature is above 26.5°C[79.7]   in a given location sea surface temperatures normally fluctuate and at the end of the summer, when conditions are right a cyclone will form. So what happens when we keep adding energy/heat to the ocean? The frequency of cyclones will increase."

I just saw the movie, Merchants of Doubt, and highly recommend it to people on both sides of the ""debate"". It shows, quite clearly (and very cleverly), how the fossil fuel industry (and others) muddy the facts by manufacturing doubt. It is excellent. It is only being shown as limited engagements right now, but try to get it in a theater in your town. Soon.  We also had a wonderful panel discussion after the movie and one panelist said something along these lines: deniers belong to a certain ""tribe"" and that tribe subscribes to certain beliefs, and if you are a member of that tribe and you change your opinion, then you are not longer a member of that particular tribe. (The same can be said for everyone, as we are all members of some tribe or other). Once you change your opinion, then you will likely be ostracized and will have to find a new tribe. Maybe you can find someone who shares the same values, but understands how climate change happens, and have them talk.  These ""merchants of doubt"" are also responsible for the shift in Christian ""end times"" thinking, according to another panelist. They have managed to link climate change to the second coming of Jesus, causing some religious folks to unknowingly promote the fossil fuel agenda. That agenda being: business as usual, and to hell with the consequences.  A little background on conservative Christian (Presbyterian) thinking, as I knew it growing up in the States:  It used to be, when I was a kid (eons ago), that Armageddon and the Second Coming were somewhere in the future, the exact time unknowable to us humans. To try to predict the Second Coming was to be very, very presumptuous: attempting to know the mind of God!... but now, with the shift caused by these Merchants of Doubt, some Christians have been tricked into thinking that they can predict when the End Times are coming because they can interpret Revelations ""correctly"". It is a sick and insidious trick, to make people support their own destruction through manipulation of their religion.  TL;DR: Watch Merchants of Doubt. Seriously. Do it now.

I am seeing a lot of emphasis from skeptics on the ARGO ocean temp data, for instance, which apparently demonstrates a ""pause"" in the rising temp. This is fueling a lot of the debate for skeptics. It seems, however, that ARGO is not in fact demonstrating a pause and that the data needs to be looked at not only from layers of depth but oceanic regions as well. From what I understand the climatologists don't expect a homogeneous rise in temp globally and therefore the slowdown we're seeing in rising temp may not be indicative of anything."

Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 107(21), 9552-9555.   Because combustion of all available fossil fuels could produce 2.75 doublings of CO2 by 2300 (5), even a 4.5 °C sensitivity could eventually produce 12 °C of warming.  We conclude that a global-mean warming of roughly 7 °C would create small zones where metabolic heat dissipation would for the first time become impossible, calling into question their suitability for human habitation. A warming of 11–12 °C would expand these zones to encompass most of today’s human population. This likely overestimates what could practically be tolerated: Our limit applies to a person out of the sun, in gale-force winds, doused with water, wearing no clothing, and not working."

A warming of 21 degrees Fahrenheit (12 degrees Celsius) would put half of the world's population in an uninhabitable environment.   According to the most moderate scientists, we cannot exceed 4 degrees Celsius global average and expect to sustain habitat. Yet this article claims we can keep half the world's population at 12C? Humans will be long gone by the time 12C hits."

Also, according to Kevin Anderson, even +4C means a local temperature increase on the hottest days of +10C-+12C in New York (23min 40s if the timestamp doesn't work). I don't know what +12C globally will do to local temperature extremes, but I imagine it's going to be more than +12C. I suspect this article doesn't consider that."

The ""hockey stick"" doesn't project anything. It doesn't say anything about future climate change. It's not the basis for any projection of future climate change. Period. You literally have no clue what you're talking about. Seriously - almost everything else you can assert can be debunked with one-liners:   How odd however that it entirely misses the medieval warm period!   There was no global medieval warm period; it was a regional phenomen. MBH98 very clearly shows this, as have many other independent studies.

You mistake ""defending"" something for ""calling you out on your pure, unadulterated bullshit"". They're not the same thing ;)   Especially when it has proven entirely inaccurate   Many, many studies have independently verified the hockey stick. I already linked you to three major ones here.   Especially not to the insane predictions of melting arctic (Record level ice in the antarctic, in case you were wondering)   Not sure how anything having to do with antarctica is relevant to the arctic. They are literally polar opposites.   Ice has more mass than water, most of it in the poles is already under the water. Why would ice melting into a less rigid molecular structure and releasing gas pockets and particulates, cause the ocean levels to rise?   Antarctica is a continent. With land. And it is very clearly losing land ice, as is Greenland (Shepherd, 2012). Ice on land isn't floating on water, and causes sea level rise when it melts.   Oh I would love to see what they have to see about that.   Here you go. But seriously - why are you getting on a soapbox and criticizing a paper which you tacitly admit you haven't even read?   Seriously. Your skeptic-fu is really weak. You shouldn't venture too far from /r/climateskeptics until you're more familiar with their memes.     In an address to congress. No wonder you would dump the blame on the other fellow and attempt to distance them! Quite damning indeed.   Yeah, that's called ""hearsay"". The thing is, you could actually try to establish a baseline to support Christy's wild accusations. It would simply involve going through the drafts of TAR and the comments, and tracing how the passage on the Hockey Stick was written. This information has been public available for nearly 15 years now. Yet, no skeptic has ever bothered to present the damning evidence they found which would illustrate duplicity by the IPCC TAR authors?   I wonder why that is? Oh wait, no I don't - it's because they're just part of an innuendo-laden smear campaign, since Christy and other skeptics have no scientific argument to stand on.   Oh then allow me to clarify, provide evidence you think is suitible that provides something contrary to what I have posted   Dude, go back and re-read my original comment. It's six sentences. And they simply point out that the plot you offered was missing important components - error bars and attribution. I'm not disproving anything on that chart. I know it's real, because it's a ripoff of this figure from the IPCC AR5 Technical Summary which was created based off of an original figure from the 0th-order Draft of AR5. But as the final figure from AR5 clearly shows, your bastardized version of the figure is de-contextualized; without error bars, it attempts to highlight a point which is not supported by the complete dataset.   And do you know what? If you had the real, valid version of the graph, you could make a compelling argument that the models are systematically running too hot. Then we could talk some actual science. We could ask why. We could learn something. You wouldn't have had to resort to digging yourself an absurd hole out of a total red herring.   That's what's most pathetic about your defense of the chart. Because if you knew the slightest thing about it or climate science, you'd realize what a powerful argument you actually might have that climate models run too hot. (It's wrong by the way, but getting to that why is far too deep to delve into with someone who doesn't know the difference between a GCM and the hockey stick).   You've debunked nothing, though clearly are enjoying making a fool of yourself while attempting to sound intelligent.    ROFL! Speaking of ""projection...""  This was fun. You seriously think the hockey stick is a projection of future climate change and an input to climate models, don't you? Geeze. It's great that sites like WUWT do such a good job of keeping you so hopelessly misinformed; it means that you are so hopelessly irrelevant to the serious discourse that no one save for procrastinating redditors have to bother wasting their time on you.  Now, run on back to /r/climateskeptics for some moral support, and try again when you're ready to defend charts that would get an undergraduate flunked out of a 101 science class."

As far as I know, when permafrost melts and decays in the presence of oxygen, carbon dioxide is released, but when not in the presence of oxygen, methane is produced and it is much more potent in the short term. Methane is also leaking out of the Arctic ocean from methane hydrates. I can't give you a time frame because no one really knows, but the conclusion should be that this is a complete disaster.

It ends up being affected by completely coincidental things too like whether lightning strikes were getting rained on or not.  That's pretty random.  That it's higher than average (even the average for a busier part of fire season) is kind of pointless too.  The average is made up of a bunch of slow and busy weeks.  Mostly slow ones.  Then you get a big lightning bust and have a stupidly large number of starts.  I remember waking up one morning in June and it had been a fairly unremarkable season so far but that day there were several thousand new fires in my state.  Hi ho, hi ho, it's off to work I go.  Acreage or hectares burned is a bit better of a proxy for climate stuff because it depends a lot on fuel conditions.  But it's also confounded by a lot of dumb luck: whether fires start in spots that will promote growth, whether starts coincide with wind events, etc...  It's interesting talking to old guys with leathery ears though.  They're pretty consistently of the opinion that fire seasons and fuel conditions are typically worse now than when they were young.  In some cases they're talking about fuel conditions that never happened in their life prior to now."

climate,36zra0,Temuzjin,1 point,Mon May 25 15:13:12 2015 UTC,"I totally agree.  Here is some relevant text from the Unabomber Manifesto (which I happened to have been reading recently):   Some people take the line that modern man has too much power, too much control over nature; they argue for a more passive attitude on the part of the human race. At best these people are expressing themselves unclearly, because they fail to distinguish between power for LARGE ORGANIZATIONS and power for INDIVIDUALS and SMALL GROUPS. It is a mistake to argue for powerlessness and passivity, because people NEED power. Modern man as a collective entitysthat is, the industrial systemshas immense power over nature, and we (FC) regard this as evil. But modern INDIVIDUALS and SMALL GROUPS OF INDIVIDUALS have far less power than primitive man ever did. Generally speaking, the vast power of ""modern man"" over nature is exercised not by individuals or small groups but by large organizations. To the extent that the average modern INDIVIDUAL can wield the power of technology, he is permitted to do so only within narrow limits and only under the supervision and control of the system. (You need a license for everything and with the license come rules and regulations.) The individual has only those technological powers with which the system chooses to provide him. His PERSONAL power over nature is slight.   Primitive INDIVIDUALS and SMALL GROUPS actually had considerable power over nature; or maybe it would be better to say power WITHIN nature. When primitive man needed food he knew how to find and prepare edible roots, how to track game and take it with homemade weapons. He knew how to protect himself from heat, cold, rain, dangerous animals, etc. But primitive man did relatively little damage to nature because the COLLECTIVE power of primitive society was negligible compared to the COLLECTIVE power of industrial society.   Instead of arguing for powerlessness and passivity, one should argue that the power of the INDUSTRIAL SYSTEM should be broken, and that this will greatly INCREASE the power and freedom of INDIVIDUALS and SMALL GROUPS."

The ANDRILL program, at the conclusion of drilling it's first borehole in 2007 reported the likelihood of thresholds in the climate system, meaning co2 concentrations.

Other thresholds have been suggested at 405ppm where self sustaining feed back systems kick in. I've been posting positive feedbacks for the last 6 months as I run across them. This, I believe is why the scientific community suggested this is year that we must drastically cut emissions and continue to cut emissions until were at zero, hopefully within a decade. Anyone who suggest that there is a little time left or a little room to continue on this path is delusional.

Here a few days there was a post that said...we've cooked in 6-8 meters of SLR, I don't know who, I dont care about the who.  But where did that come from? Were looking at 80ft or so, the majority of it this century and the next. The IPCC says 1-2 meters by 2100, I'm not sure if they've revised that upward or not. To me, that's just being dishonest. But all the ice is melting all over the planet right now, why would it ever stop? Well, I really should point out that all the ice that is melting is connected to the marine environment, which is Greenland and the wais and some marine glaciers around Antarctica. If we stop soon, like now, we may be spared the melt of the EAIS. I also feel everyone should be alarmed by this and act appropriately.  I'll post something from the ANDRILL program below.  Bibliographic Code: 2013AGUFMGC51A0950H Abstract The ANDRILL Program cored a >2,300 m-thick sedimentary record of environmental conditions spanning the last 20 million years from the continental shelf of the Ross Sea during two drilling campaigns in 2006 and 2007. Integrated data and modeling studies suggest that marine margins of Antarctica's ice sheets (AIS) retreated to the coast repeatedly during the early Pliocene and mid-Miocene when atmospheric CO2 concentrations were >400 ppm. Ice sheets only advanced across the continental shelf when CO2 decreased below 400 ppm. These outcomes support hypotheses for the existence of CO2 thresholds in the climate system. For its next drilling campaign ANDRILL seeks to examine AIS behaviour by recovering a rock record from a prior interval of geologic time in which CO2 concentrations were much higher, and approached values projected for the next century. Oligocene and older Paleogene strata at two sites on Coulman High beneath the Ross Ice Shelf will reveal past physical and biological conditions in the Ross Sea and provide new constraints on ice sheet response to climate change forced by high atmospheric CO2. Ice volume estimates from ice sheet models using BEDMAP2 boundary conditions suggest that ocean-driven melt of marine-based sectors of Antarctica's ice sheets could contribute up to 22 meters to future global sea level rise. Geological records of sea level and proxy-based reconstructions of atmospheric CO2 indicate that sea level was up to 22 meters higher than present when CO2 concentrations last exceeded 400 ppm. These results suggest that Earth's marine-based ice sheets are vulnerable to atmospheric CO2 concentrations above preindustrial levels. Direct evidence of ice sheet dynamics under relevant CO2 concentrations are required to test these inferences. Integration of past and proposed ANDRILL records with proposed and existing IODP and DSDP sites in the southwest Pacific will offer a latitudinal transect that links Southern Ocean processes with polar climate change and ice sheet dynamics under a range of CO2 conditions."

You've got to distance yourself from your hard-wired hope & optimism. You've got to question your faith in technology. And so on. And that is harder than it sounds. It helps if you don't have kids who will have to live in that future.   [the commenter's words] I'll add a few extra characteristics to this list:  1) The willingness to question oneself as thoroughly as when questioning others and to follow whatever conclusions may arise from facts and observations rather than picking and choosing facts and observations filtered to fit pre-determined conclusions.  2) The free time necessary to really allow both the questioning and the searching for answers. (Not having children certainly helps with this.)  3) A fluency in or ability to examine multiple fields as they relate to the questioning rather than being isolated in one specific field and only applying that knowledge (as an economist would do when drawing up solutions to climate change).  4) A pretty much unhealthy obsession with seeking out (at least more) objective truths - unhealthy in that more objective truths are often unpleasant, which makes even the healthiest and sanest people uncomfortable.  5) A constitutional ability to manage those more objective truths without resorting to self-destruction or self-deception.  All of the above, especially the characteristics you listed, filter down the pool of humans to a miniscule percentage of the total population, and the ones in that tiny pool are almost certain to have very little influence on others due to those very same characteristics. My observations of the most 'successful' people in this world is that they almost uniformly display opposite characteristics to this list."

The Earth currently has an axial tilt of about 23.4°.[7] This value remains approximately the same relative to a stationary orbital plane throughout the cycles of precession.[8] However, because the ecliptic (i.e. the Earth's orbit) moves due to planetary perturbations, the obliquity of the ecliptic is not a fixed quantity. At present, it is decreasing at a rate of about 47"" per century.    The obliquity of the ecliptic is not a fixed quantity, so that remark in itself suggest their is room for movement.

Have the recent studies showing that the ice is thinner in many places changed part of this explanation (that part originally discussed in Zhang)? Or is reduced mixing still part of the equation?  It seems to me that it could also be due in part to more glacial ice slipping into the sea but SS does not seem to include this possibility.  In the long run when the Antarctic ice gets thin enough and starts to break up I assume the overall surface area will also decrease following the trend in the data shown here.

We do not attack anyone who disagrees with the IPCC.  We expect them to present a wealth of evidence for claims that fly in the face of what the IPCC has found.  We also expect folks not to jump to irrational, hyperbolic, and emotive conclusions based on a single study that's quoted by a wild-eyed journalist with a penchant for melodrama.

That is, to say the least, uncertain, and where's there's uncertainty there's always hope.  After all, we're talking about scenarios that model economic and technological development out to 2100. It's one thing to predict how the climate system will change over a century — climate moves slowly — but another entirely to predict human development that far ahead. Social change is non-linear; after periods of relative stasis, societies can lurch to a new equilibrium almost overnight (a pattern known as ""punctuated equilibrium""). What will be technologically feasible in 2050, or 2080? What political changes will take place between now and then? We have virtually no idea. So as Koomey says, we can't know in advance whether 2°C will prove to be feasible. We can't see the future.  And in general, I agree. I have written in the past about how the integrated assessment models (IAMs) used to create these scenarios contain such a wide array of contestable assumptions, about developments in so far in the future, that it is ludicrous to interpret their results as anything but thought exercises.  There could be a fundamental shift in consciousness and behavior sometime this century. Many people responded to my post by citing the relatively big recent shifts on gay marriage and marijuana as examples.   Sounds like the author is in the bargaining stage of grief."

Those are mild, passing gusts compared with the mighty wind necessary to blow the entire world economy in a new direction. The shift required to achieve 2°C would have to be enormous — utterly without historical precedent — and it would have to get underway soon.   This paragraph is what makes the four ""science doesn't know everything!"" paragraphs into bargaining and not denial. So for that, I agree it's relevant.   However, it does read like bargaining to me, even when reading the paragraph after: ""maybe I don't have cancer? I feel fine today! [Talk for four paragraphs about how you're fine and doctors can't predict the future for certain.] Yet I guess that feeling fine today isn't a significant factor in the question whether or not I have cancer..."""
climate,36l7an,LegendsOfChange,3,Wed May 20 21:46:37 2015 UTC,"I shouldn't have stated the paragraph afterwards, sorry about that. What I should have pointed out was the further exposition  ""Hoping for a fundamental shift in human consciousness and politics in the next 10 to 15 years amounts to hoping for a miracle. That's what hoping for 2°C means — banking on a miracle.  Which is fine. It's great to have hope! Not that long ago I wrote a whole long post about hope, which came down strongly on the pro-hope side of the debate. (It was popular; you should go read it.)  But particularly when it comes to policymakers and the people advising them, we also need clear-eyed straight talk. ""We don't yet know that 2°C is impossible"" is very different from ""We're on track."" The fact is, based on what we know about carbon budgets, path dependence, and status quo bias, changing the fossil fuel energy system fast enough to stay under 2°C appears increasingly unlikely. We are rapidly losing options, and the ones that remain are unrealistic or unpleasant.""  It is bargaining, but that bargaining the author only applies that to their own outlook on the future. He is very pragmatic about what has to actually be done, and his previous article was written about how unlikely it will be to achieve the sociopolitical climate to combat climate change."

climate,36lkgm,Temuzjin,2,Wed May 20 07:41:08 2015 UTC,"Hence, you should read the RCP8.5 scenario as “if we invent geoengineering, and if we mitigate very little, then this is likely.”   I don't think RCP8.5 contains much in the way of carbon dioxide removal. It is required in RCP2.6 (which under certain circumstances requires negative emissions by 2100). RCPs are confusing though, so I might have got that wrong."
climate,36lkgm,nimbuscile,0,Wed May 20 08:40:39 2015 UTC,"RCP8.5 leads to about +4C in 2100 though, in which the earth has a carrying capacity of less than one billion people. Saying ""yes the IPCC's relatively pleasant scenarios are too optimistic but the IPCC's utter disaster scenario is not too optimistic"" doesn't fill me with great confidence.  Also, if you're right, then RCP8.5 is the scenario in which 1) we choose a business as usual course and 2) geoengineering proves relatively ineffective/doesn't work at all, while RCP2.6 is the scenario in which 1) we choose to aggressively reduce our emissions and 2) geoengineering proves very effective.   In other words, if you're right, then we've changed two variables/assumptions at once. That's a big no-no in science, because then you don't know which variable had which effect.   Because ""change only one variable at a time"" is such a well-known rule in science, it seems much more likely to me that the IPCC did in fact only change one variable at a time. In other words, I suspect that the RCPs assume the same (unreasonably high) level of geoengineering and only vary the aggressiveness of our emission reductions.  That being said, I could be wrong. I couldn't find any references that specifically talked about the RCP8.5 assumptions. Sources are welcome."
climate,36lkgm,LegendsOfChange,3,Wed May 20 09:55:03 2015 UTC,"The RCPs are not different geoengineering scenarios, they are Representative Concentration Pathways, scenarios that model the effects of different concentrations of co2 ppm. In fact in the IPCC report it is explicitly stated that they are not emissions pathways, people just most often show the graphics pertaining to temperature rise at each RCP. RCP 2.6 however, remains unfeasible because it assumes a drop in the co2 parts per million. However every other RCP scenario is not because, because they assumes a leveling off of co2 concentration, which is entirely possible, if improbable. The RCPs are a way of looking at climate modeling based on co2 concentration, they are not a portfolio of geoengineering assumptions."
climate,36lkgm,LegendsOfChange,2,Wed May 20 14:35:16 2015 UTC,"After looking it up, you're right that they're not emission pathways but CO2 concentration pathways. Thanks for the correction. You're also probably correct that RCP8.5 isn't technically the most likely scenario under business as usual and certain geoengineering assumptions.  I have to say though that I don't understand the ""representative"" part of representative concentration pathway. What's the justification for describing a RCP8.5 pathway as opposed to, say, a RCP9.0 or a RCP8.2 pathway? I get that it's technically correct to say ""we don't say anything about how likely this scenario is, we just describe what happens."" Then again, they did explicitly choose to describe a situation with a radiative forcing value of +8.5 W/m2 in 2100. Why that number?  If the answer to this question is ""because a back-of-the-envelope calculation based on certain emission and geoengineering assumptions indicated a RCP8.5 scenario to be likely"" then we've effectively hidden our assumptions in the decision to model RCP8.5 in the first place.  If the answer is ""I dunno, it seemed like a decent number"" then I think that's very irresponsible, because surely the IPCC knows that their worst-case scenario will (incorrectly) be widely interpreted as the business-as-usual forecast."
climate,36lkgm,LegendsOfChange,1 point,Wed May 20 15:20:11 2015 UTC,"It is a bit strange because RCP8.5 is both the business as usual forecast, the worst case scenario, and highly unrealistic. It is the business as usual because it was taken from the current sustained emissions growth at at certain percentage year on year into 2100. This however is improbable because at least in my opinion, we have neither the fuel to last that long nor will humanity be inhabiting much of the planet if we are at that insanely high level of fossil fuel usage. Now it is still could happen, but I'm pretty sure once the impacts are tangible people will mobilize, changing the RCP trajectory. Will it be too late still? Possibly, probably, but RCP 8.5 is unlikely in my eyes.  None of the RCPs have assumed geoengineering in them, however the one that does include negative emissions, which are the 'science fiction' covered in ""survivable Ipcc scenarios are science fiction"" is RCP 2.6. 2.6 is definitely likely impossible, and has only been used because it is the only scenario in which we stay under 2C change, so that is also off the table in my mind.   The other two, RCP 4.5 and RCP 6 are bad, but not apocalyptic. Neither includes negative emissions, and both are possible in terms of emissions scenarios.  However, as many bring up, these scenarios don't take into account certain aspects like positive feedbacks. For information that isn't vague like guy mcpherson's, scientists like Peter Wadhams, who are considered fringe scientists, predicts .8C from methane release by 2050. Still bad, but not apocalyptic. There are many other sources for other feedbacks and their response to climate change but they are a factor that aren't discussed in the literature. Sorry that was a bit of a tangent.  So ultimately the RCPs aren't perfect, as the high and low estimates are most likely not possible, but the two in between seem like likely scenarios that hold up with models and otherwise."

At the end of the study period, they told me that they were going to refuse to act because of political pressure (George W. Bush was president), but it became a model, and most European automakers have switched to non global warming technology for air conditioning, and the American industry is on the way, too.  It is a small step, but it is an example of what just one person can do, and there are many more like me."

climate,364b11,jeffwong,2,Sat May 16 20:03:03 2015 UTC,"Measurements can be made with the use of satellites for a great number of applications. Measuring atmospheric CO2 is certainly within our capabilities.  An excerpt / example:   CO2 has been monitored by taking flask sample measurements at diverse location s such as ocean buoys, tall  towers and onboard aircraft. The weakness of this method is twofold. Firstly, samples have to be measured by many different instruments which have been calibrated in a different way, which questions the accuracy of the measurements. Secondly, sampling stations are sparsely located, often at isolated locations, which eliminate the local sources of CO2. To be able to work out how the Earth responds to CO2 in the atmosphere, many measurements need to be made at closely located points at the surface and higher in the atmosphere.   The SCIAMACHY instrument orbits the Earth 13 times a day in a polar sun synchronous orbit, that passes  the equator at 10am local time. Coverage is best at the polar regions, however complete global coverage  is made every 5 days. The instrument  measures trace gases in columns of the atmosphere, and a combination of forward facing (limb) and straight down (nadir) measurements can be used to  obtain a 3D representation of  the current state of  the atmosphere.  SCIAMACHY is a passive instrument which measures Earth-shine, the  light reflected by the Earth from the sun. Some of this light is absorbed by the trace gases in the atmosphere.  By working out how much light is absorbed, the concentration of trace gases, such as CO2, can be obtained. The University of Leicester, along with collaborators at other institutions have developed a method to accurately obtain concentrations of CO2.   Of course there are multiple satellites, using different methods by different agencies and research groups that can combine their data for greater accuracy as well as ever improving instrumentation, reducing error."
