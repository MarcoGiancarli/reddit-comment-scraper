formula1,3e22hx,RaidenG37ipl,105,Tue Jul 21 10:40:17 2015 UTC,Thankfully it's so rare these days. I remember seeing an interview with Jackie Stewart and his wife talking about how it was totally normal for them in the 60s/70s to attend 2 or 3 driver's funerals a year. Probably part of the reason the paddock seemed so close.
formula1,3e22hx,Chicken_Bake,57,Tue Jul 21 12:19:28 2015 UTC,"I think the paddock is still very close. A lot of the crew share flights together, and since most are based in Britain they share a culture, language and nationality.  Then look at events like when the Williams garage burned down... engineers from all up and down the pit lane sped down the moment an alarm was raised to help out.  Most of the arguments which go on are just for the media like Eddie and Ron recently."

formula1,3e22hx,RaidenG37ipl,4,Tue Jul 21 12:23:38 2015 UTC,I think it was closer because it was also much smaller.  Now you have teams that bring 80 people.  Where before you had teams of like 10-15 people.  Every team would stay in the same hotel.  The pit lane was probably much more intimate.

As for JEV specifically, being french they all were part of the FFSA (French motorsport federation) youth program, so they must have spent a lot of time together in training camps and the like, that and JEV mentioned multiple times that Bianchi was his best friend in the paddock, and that when he got the axe from STR, Jules was very supportive of him."

formula1,3e22hx,MrCelroy,2,Tue Jul 21 15:05:40 2015 UTC,"Regardless of the multi billion dollar business that F1 is, don't overlook some simple things:  There are only 22 drivers, if you include test drivers let's make it 40. Those drivers have 20 races a year, which (including everything) means 4 days at the track. F1 drivers (as well as anyone working in F1) are a very small and tight community and they know each other surprisingly well, they have plenty of meetings every week (including official FIA press conferences, drivers breefing, GPDA meetings, etc.), often enough the teams are only spread over 1-4 hotels, sometimes they have the same sponsors (eg engine manufacturer) or manager, and many raced another during international youth series as well (most famously Rosberg and Hamilton). Older drivers often enough start to be a mentor for younger ones (Häkkinen with Bottas, Schumacher with Vettel).   So yes, if you take away the Ides and Yoongs, they know each other much better than many expect. Being the absolute elite of racing drivers and pretty much being forced to see each other day after day, week after week, the drivers always bond. Bianchi is a special case here because although he was not a F1 race driver for long, he was brought up by the pretty much most powerful and influential connection there is - the Todt family & Ferrari.  I guess it's hard to describe these things, but those who are the best of the best always know each other well, regardless of the matter."

Jules Bianchi's death has greatly affected the Spaniard, who has lived an ordeal thinking Bianchi since the fateful accident occurred Suzuka, and has therefore chosen not to participate in the funeral of Nice, where other riders have indeed been as Lewis Hamilton, Nico Rosberg, Romain Grosjean, Daniel Ricciardo or Spanish Pedro de la Rosa and Roberto Merhi, among many others. Even the four-time champion Alain Prost went to the cathedral to dismiss Nice fellow. Massa, Vergne, one of the best friends of Bianchi and Maldonado were very affected, and could not hold back the tears when he left the coffin. Alonso, however, prefers to mourn his friend intimately. From the night that the news is confirmed, it has been in permanent contact with family, with whom he joins a great relationship since she met Jules in 2010 at Ferrari. You do not want to participate in any public show, and indeed not show his pain, who has much, if you can help. He was one of the first to be that night at the hospital in Mie that Bianchi was moved to after the accident with the crane, and do not forget who they were and who is not. In this Formula 1, everything is so restricted, Alonso will participate in the tributes that are set for this weekend in Hungary. But do not want any personalized show, or be noticed.

formula1,3e22hx,AstralThundercunt,86,Tue Jul 21 12:06:31 2015 UTC,"JEV didn't decide to put it on, it's a customary jacket worn by all drivers in the Ferrari stable for either funerals or certain special events. Has been for a while. There's a shot of Alonso and Kimi wearing the same thing last year at Senna's remembrance ceremony at Imola."

formula1,3e22hx,RouseHouse1013,15,Tue Jul 21 12:13:08 2015 UTC,Thats not comercial at all. Its the customary Ferrari wear for funerals and memorials. Kimi and Alonso wore the same suit in Sennas memorial last year.
formula1,3e22hx,NaiveMind,24,Tue Jul 21 13:27:39 2015 UTC,I don't understand how it isn't commercial if Ferrari drivers are required to wear it. It's promoting and drawing attention to the brand in what is meant to be a solemn occasion.
formula1,3e22hx,c3vzn,13,Tue Jul 21 14:34:12 2015 UTC,"I'm with you.  I understand it's customary, and that there may be some tradition in it... and I even could buy the argument that it's more about the 'ferrari family' than the 'ferrari brand' but I still think it's in poor taste."
formula1,3e22hx,jigielnik,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:42:17 2015 UTC,No way is it poor taste. The intention would be to show solidarity with the families and loved ones of the lost.  Remember the tradition would have started when deaths in Formula One were far more common than they are today. No one back then gave a single fuck about PR.

I was born the same year as Jules, 1989, and I still feel like a kid half the time. I cannot even begin to imagine what his family must be going through.   I'm not a religious person at all, so I hope that instead of praying for him and wishing him a good rest... we can help him to truly live forever by preserving the memory of the man he was, the happiness contained within him, and the life he lived doing the job he loved."

Or Webber in Valencia 2010, had he gone slightly off track it could've ended horribly wrong. Or some others, McNish in Suzuka, R. Schumacher in Indy twice, not to forget of some like M. Schumacher in Britain 1999 where he actually broke his leg.  Sounds brutal, but we had nothing but luck that we got over 20 years without dead drivers, but at some point it was bound to happen. Motorsports is dangerous, they print it on every single ticket, and everyone does the best they can to remove the risks - but on days like this, we have to accept the grim reality that in the end, fatalities are inevitable. The best thing we can do, actually the only thing we can do, is improve further and further so that a driver needs less and less luck to survive a given impact. Between the incident of Peterson and those of Villeneuve/Patelli were only 4 years. From then on until Ratzeberger/Senna, it took 12 years. And now it took 21 years until Bianchi had to pay with his life."

About four years ago I lost my grandfather, kind of suddenly(he went to his state FOP meeting Thursday, died Saturday). When we went to the hospital earlier during Saturday because they where about to administer last rights, I broke down and couldn't even be in the room because I couldn't take my grandfather in the state he was in tubes everywhere unconscious just waiting to die. I was in such a state of despair over it, I almost didn't go to the wake or the funeral. I went because of my mom, and I had to just face it. While some will argue this post saying why didn't he attend for Jules family, its just not that simple; human emotion is complicated, I thought I was going to be able to deal with seeing my grandfather dying it wasn't until I got there that I learned that I couldn't. Alonso might have just not have been able to take laying to rest one of his closest friends, the emotions around a funeral are very strong for all involved. He deals with his emotions differently then you and I and everyone else in the world. Alonso is grieving in his own way the best he knows how, and simply might have not wanted to torture himself by being there."

He only died 5 days ago, if it's hard for us - and we're just fans - then imagine what it must be like for them, and especially Alonso knowing how close they were.

formula1,3e2osk,Indestructavincible,-2,Tue Jul 21 17:05:25 2015 UTC,the jcbs dont work all the time that why there are crains etc if they are towed by a quad etc they could move around the track much faster than the heavy equipment so less would be needed since they are more mobile they could be made slightly larger to accommodate wec and possible gt cars. as for tracks owning them they would be reltivly cheap to make and could be used for other events most tracks have single seaters etc

formula1,3e2osk,Indestructavincible,3,Tue Jul 21 19:08:32 2015 UTC,"JCBs are used because crains aren't in range.  In an optimal world, crains would always be used since don't need to enter the track and it's safe for everyone involved.  Your idea seems very flimsy to me, both from a structural view, and usability.  Since the car can only enter from one side, you're very limited. A JCB just need to get close in order to lift it.  A JCB is highly manouverable across multiple types of terrain, your idea needs to be towed, and has very low ground clearance.  To me the construction looks like it will fall apart from almost nothing. Sure it's quick to build perhaps, but when JCBs are already in use with almost any track, you only need to rent a few of them for a GP. And it's cheap.  I think you're looking at the wrong thing to fix here...  Yes, JCBs have been a safety concern for a lot of years, however Jules accident was more or less the first one involving a JCB, apart from the 2007 european GP where a car nudged one.  The issue does not lie with JCBs, it's with drivers pushing the limit when there are yellow and double yellow being waved. Fix that, and JCBs will not be an issue."

formula1,3e2osk,ceribus_peribus,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:21:58 2015 UTC,it should be light weight enough to be pushed over and the should be enough ground clearance to stop it bottoming out which is what causes the f1 cars to be become stuck

formula1,3e2osk,ceribus_peribus,-1,Tue Jul 21 15:45:07 2015 UTC,Just stick a chain on it and winch it out after they run it out there?
formula1,3e2osk,ceribus_peribus,7,Tue Jul 21 15:52:28 2015 UTC,"Ok sure, but don't bother with this frame contraption then.

formula1,3e2osk,cbung,0,Tue Jul 21 16:05:29 2015 UTC,"ah yes good point... hmm although now that I'm thinking about it I get the feeling the idea of ""picking the car up"" is to prevent further damage? The teams probably don't want it dragged eh"
formula1,3e2osk,ceribus_peribus,0,Tue Jul 21 16:15:06 2015 UTC,"Yeah... here's how you could salvage this:  keep the frame and the winch, but forget about using it as an extraction platform.  Trundle this thing out and use it to lift, then slide the sled under it and lower it down.  Then unhook the frame and trundle it away, and the sled can be pulled with a tow cable."

There's no guarantee that it's a straight line to the opening in the wall from the wreck, so a ""behind the barriers"" winch vehicle would be problematic.    You'll have to get the marshals to man up and form a pulling team like a group of Egyptian slaves transporting a block of marble for the pyramids.  That or bring out a team of oxen, maybe.   Either would make for great TV."
formula1,3e2osk,asoap,0,Tue Jul 21 16:38:04 2015 UTC,Couldn't they just hook a winch onto one of those machines that's basically a big arm and/or a platform on an arm? It would be off the ground then?

formula1,3e2osk,TomF1,7,Tue Jul 21 15:26:51 2015 UTC,Just needs to switch the wheels out for a couple of continuous tracks and even the gravel pits shouldn't be a problem.
formula1,3e2osk,HeikkiKovalainen,3,Tue Jul 21 15:31:21 2015 UTC,True. It's hard to make a low vehicle that'll travel over the gravel.
formula1,3e2osk,_I_AM_BATMAN_,8,Tue Jul 21 15:29:17 2015 UTC,What about gravel traps? With a smaller contact patch and all the weight when lifting an F1 car this is going to sink into the gravel and be very difficult to pull out. You'd need a digger or something to pull it and then you're back at square one.
formula1,3e2osk,HeikkiKovalainen,-4,Tue Jul 21 15:25:33 2015 UTC,f1 cars get stuck since they bottom out this should have enough clearance to not get stuck a quad could help pull it if needed

formula1,3e2osk,HeikkiKovalainen,21,Tue Jul 21 15:38:23 2015 UTC,"These cars are over 700 kg man, there's no way your design will support that, and when we start looking at designs that will we get into concerns about it being 'heavy machinery' again. Further is this thing just pushed out of the gravel traps? Do you have six mechanics pushing it at all times, being very exposed? If a bianchi accident happens against this contraption with a bunch of marshalls pushing it the accident will be worse. If you have a driver on it somewhere they will also be more exposed than any F1 driver is. What about lifting the car out of barriers and stuff? Are we going to just get marshalls to stand behind the car and pull with all their might to get cars unstuck before we can get this thing around the car?"
formula1,3e2osk,ceribus_peribus,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:35:19 2015 UTC,"Dude its a concept. The concept doesn't have to be structurally sound, thats why its a concept. All it is is an idea not a plan."
formula1,3e2osk,graphicsaccelerated,2,Tue Jul 21 17:11:13 2015 UTC,"My point was that I think it'll simply become classified as heavy machinery if we were to ever get it to be structurally sound, negating its purpose."
formula1,3e2osk,graphicsaccelerated,0,Tue Jul 21 17:26:21 2015 UTC,Nope. I work in motorsport and have seen frames made from aluminium RHS that will easily lift an F1 car. The frame can be lifted by 2 guys.  Edit: F1 is a world leader in composite design and manufacture. You could make a carbon structure that weighed under 100kgs that could lift several cars
formula1,3e2osk,ceribus_peribus,4,Tue Jul 21 17:35:59 2015 UTC,"You may be right. As I said I was uncertain and more concerned with his current design. It takes all of ten minutes to do a stress test in CAD but I digress - I accept a static frame could easily lift one, but one that's intended to have some sort of locomotion would be different.  That said, even if you overlook all of that the concept still doesn't work in my eyes. Do you have a man on the back driving this thing? Or do you have a couple of marshals pushing it?  Either way it is more dangerous than the current set up.  An F1 driver hits a crane? He has a significant chance of dying, marshal is fine. An F1 driver hits one of these things with a marshal driving it? Marshal dies, F1 driver has a reduced but not insignificant chance of dying (especially since you have the car being evacuated elevated). An F1 driver hits one of these things with marshals pushing it? Multiple marshals die, F1 driver again might die."
formula1,3e2osk,ceribus_peribus,-1,Tue Jul 21 17:46:11 2015 UTC,i dont think the 700kg is a problem 1 inch steel frame is going to be strong rember in the pits 2 mechanics lift it. pushing it should not be to much of a problem since it could be pulled by a quad or have eletric  hubs which power the wheels. the marshels may be more exposed but the frame stucture should allow better visablity of the track. lifting the car out of barriers would be harder but a the jcb still could be used but they still only pull at the car the which could do the same there could be a secondary which at the rear to help pulling it out.
formula1,3e2osk,ceribus_peribus,8,Tue Jul 21 15:42:08 2015 UTC,"in the pits 2 mechanics lift it   They'll have to be able to a) slide a jack with a long lever under the wreck, b) find a solid base under all that gravel to leverage off of, in order to have two men lift one and half tonnes of car like they do in pit lane."
formula1,3e2osk,HeikkiKovalainen,-3,Tue Jul 21 16:01:28 2015 UTC,the point is that a well designed frame should be able to suport the which
formula1,3e2osk,conman14,9,Tue Jul 21 16:03:48 2015 UTC,"Not 700 kg on a lightweight unsupported strut. Kudos for the idea...but no way in hell it would work in the form you have described. That's going to be a roughly 3 meter unsupported stretch with a point load of 700 kg at the roll hoop, lets say  2 meters from the rear support. Even with a good HSS or pipe that's going to fail any engineering rigor."
formula1,3e2osk,_I_AM_BATMAN_,-3,Tue Jul 21 16:19:47 2015 UTC,this is just the concept it could be a triangular lattice frame that spans the length
formula1,3e2osk,lloydloar,5,Tue Jul 21 16:23:44 2015 UTC,That would make accessing the car and putting in the bottom support hard. Also would make it very heavy. It's a good concept. But half baked at best.
formula1,3e2osk,theballaam96,2,Tue Jul 21 16:36:49 2015 UTC,"Here we go: portable gantry crane.  Won't be able to move while lifting of course, but it could raise the wreck while you put something underneath and then lower it down."
formula1,3e2osk,alenpetak11,3,Tue Jul 21 17:21:16 2015 UTC,Also: of course the condition it's sold in is made to be used on a concrete floor; you'd have to do something to anchor it well out in the sand.  Maybe put wide showshoe-like feet on it so it doesn't sink down instead of lifting.

formula1,3e2osk,jalal-m,11,Tue Jul 21 17:27:53 2015 UTC,"My engineering background is primarily aerospace, I haven't done any real world structural design but at least in that current setup I can be pretty sure it won't hold. Have you done a stress test on it?  And to be fair those mechanics in the pits lift it with a lot of their weight and with a long lever arm. The point remains they're over 700 kg dry regardless of how light mechanics make it look.  I don't know anything about electric wheels, but I doubt they'd be able to move this thing through gravel, at least not with the small wheels you have on this design. But I'm talking out my bum a bit here.  Visability doesn't really matter. If there's marshals on the track they should always have their eyes on the cars. If you have a marshal behind this thing, he'd rather a big heavy piece of machinery there so he doesn't get pinned between it and the wall, if he's on the other side then it doesn't matter visibility is increased.  I don't really understand your last sentence."
formula1,3e2osk,Pascalwb,-2,Tue Jul 21 15:52:51 2015 UTC,now i haven't done any FEA on it yet is was just the first basic concept and i did it in cad to get it out of my head.  wheels aside they where what i had from other designs and just added them quad tires would be better   the last point is that the jcb struggel to remove the cars they just pull it out so a second winch could be on the rear of the structure to pull it out

For that matter, what happens in situations where the car just doesn't roll at all...  I appreciate thought on this subject, but I really don't see how this is any better than what is currently in place.  It seems even more convoluted and difficult to use than present solutions and by the time you make this actually usable in many real-life situations, I really don't think this is going to be any 'lighter' than current machinery."

formula1,3e2osk,mikloise,10,Tue Jul 21 18:53:53 2015 UTC,"Ive had this idea since Jules Bianchi death that there must be a better way to remove the cars form the track with less risk to drivers and marshal's.    The idea is a light weight frame that can be towed , pushed or possablie driven by electric motors to a car which needs recovering.  It would be safer for the drivers since there is less heavy equipment on and around the track.  It would be safer for the marshes who work around the cars since there would be better visibility of both other drivers crashing or being hit or run over by heavy equipment or hit by swinging cars.  The teams may all so be in favour since the car is lifted less and there is less chance of the floor and diffuser being seen  and less chance of more damage due to swinging cars etc  and could be towed straight back to the pits rather than loading it on to a flat bed.    the frame is a simple steel frame that could be bolted together or wielded which either the fia/fom could transport or tracks could make there own   The frame would be pushed over the car with the floor panels slid to the back allowing the car to sit under the frame and allowing the winch to be attached to to role hoop  a small electric winch mounted above the car would be used to lift the car  once the car is lifted the floor panels can be slid back under the floor. an net or mesh could also be used to help support any parts that have broken off like wheels and wings"

The design works for a car that is relatively undamaged, but how about the times where the front wing is completely smashed to one side? Or when any part of the car is sticking out just a bit too much? Seems like the structure that is meant to hold the car in place could potentially obstruct a car thats bent out of shape."
formula1,3e2osk,camoriet,-2,Tue Jul 21 17:45:33 2015 UTC,at the moment its just a concept and could well be larger to fit more several damaged cars (and possable more universaly wec and gt cars) and as i said the could also be a net or mesh which could help support broken off parts such as wheels and wings

I see a system like this being used when a car has lost power but is still in one piece.   You would have to beef everything up significantly to be able to handle extraction from gravel traps and tyre walls.   I think that the safety concern with tractors can be handled reasonably well with crash bars similar to those on trailers.

What I'd do though is have 2 in-season tests 1/3 and 2/3 through the season and have the test selection chosen based on average Q1-3 positions throughout 1/3 of the season.  So average quali position is in Q1 through first 1/3 of season, you get 3 days test, Q2 = 2 days, Q3 = 1 day for the first in season test. The average from the next 1/3 of season goes towards the 2nd test.  Or it could be a combination of average quali and average race, because good quali  doesn't necessarily mean you have a good car.

Cars would be entirely unpredictable in high-speed corners and bottom out constantly.  As /u/M0ntezWalker mentioned, Ballaugh Bridge alone would be impassable at anything near race speed.

formula1,3dxztt,Eswyft,16,Tue Jul 21 01:26:49 2015 UTC,"The distinction, and reason this is different to all those in the past, is that previously the numbers were car numbers. Gilles drove car #27 for example. Jules didn't drive car 17, he was driver 17. It's a subtle difference."

A vast majority of the fan base doesn't give a shit about driver numbers. The drivers don't give a shit as well. They just pick whatever sounds good.
formula1,3dxztt,Porsche_Curves,2,Tue Jul 21 18:13:13 2015 UTC,"Your original point had some argument to it, but your followup was a bit patronizing.  The majority of drivers have some kind of symbology associated with their number.  Button's is the same as he had his championship year.  Lewis karted with his.  You get the idea.  Kimi is the only one I can name off hand that is generally apathetic about his.  Maybe a few other drivers are in his boat but most care a lot."
formula1,3dxztt,r3ynoldswrap,-2,Mon Jul 20 16:12:06 2015 UTC,Are drivers going to get upset if their number gets changed though? Nope.

I for one personally care about driver numbers, and I feel like drivers, teams and fans should embrace them more, as much as we embrace helmet designs now.  If I get into Formula One or another driver does I would like the opportunity if I wanted, to race the number 17 and make it glorious. Sadly the number 17 will for the foreseeable future remain Jules Bianchi's number and be remembered for being the number he died with."

formula1,3e283w,stevenharryw,45,Tue Jul 21 11:49:14 2015 UTC,"I tend to agree that some of the blame for the accident sits with Jules. However, the blame for the consequences of the accident is not his. It should not have been possible for any sort of instance of a driver leaving the circuit, in the manner that Jules did, to result in such a horrendous impact. Bianchi was at fault for the error that took him off track - what he found lying in his path was the fault of the FIA, really."
formula1,3e283w,xv323,7,Tue Jul 21 12:33:51 2015 UTC,"Exactly. It's unreasonable to expect a racing driver to be responsible for their own safety when doing so can negatively impact their results. Safety procedures must take that decision from the drivers' hands in order to avoid incidents like this. Thankfully, the VSC is a good start in reducing the possibility of another accident like this occurring."
formula1,3e283w,d0re,4,Tue Jul 21 15:56:32 2015 UTC,"I agree with you. I don't like the emphasis on the driver's part of the blame and how much it's being brought up.   Yes, he was not going slow enough to be able to stop on short notice, but neither was any other driver at that moment, or any other moment where double yellows were flagged IN YEARS.   A lot of people underestimate the power of pack behavior, and it's a shame that it took a life for the FIA to come up with enforcement and a more suitable/explicit way to slow drivers down (VSC)."

Essentially this would be an oval track approach.  I understand the implications, and see this is far fetched, but I'm interested in opinions, and opinions that don't attack any one's intelligence."
formula1,3e283w,schneeb,5,Tue Jul 21 12:00:12 2015 UTC,Thats what the virtual safety car does but its more precise than the american 'full course caution' with a safety car.
formula1,3e283w,bendingmarlin69,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:36:42 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure how it is more precise than an American full course caution. My point is that the driver still has the ability to go above a certain speed, even if they may be sanctioned for doing so. I'm assuming there are set speeds for each track, or conditions of the track for this virtual safety car."
formula1,3e283w,schneeb,5,Tue Jul 21 13:49:30 2015 UTC,because its actually a precise delta they must keep to; which isnt particularly different to when the normal safety car comes out but it has the advantage of keeping the gaps between the drivers and not waiting for the safety car to pick up the leaders and/or waiting for the safety car to pit after the danger is clear.
formula1,3e283w,bendingmarlin69,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:03:59 2015 UTC,"I can see your point. I'm more for closing the field up, making the racing more enjoyable, and not having a gap that the drivers can ""accidently"" speed through a corner, thus going off track.  Racing Karts in the states (road course) we did this, essentially stopping the leaders, and the back markers going very slowly to catch up, then on.   Hassle, but safe."
formula1,3e283w,schneeb,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:12:17 2015 UTC,Agreed but the lapped cars always ruin that scenario (or if they let them overtake it takes forever); I guess the VSC will be the perfect solution when they have solved the closer racing itself?
formula1,3e283w,bendingmarlin69,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:16:18 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry. I'm not following your last sentence. With lapped cars, they just stay in place. So line up with the lead lap cars. That's how we did it here. When you think of it, the gap to the leaders was decreased, but if there was a lapped car to pass previously, you still have that car to pass, now."
formula1,3e283w,schneeb,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:19:36 2015 UTC,"In F1 they sometimes let people unlap themselves making the safety car last another few laps; otherwise I was referring to the general performance of F1 cars following each other, which would make the VSC keeping the gaps less important for 'excitement' whilst keeping any lead the drivers/teams have earned."
formula1,3e283w,bendingmarlin69,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:21:26 2015 UTC,"And I'm not a fan of allowing cars to unlap themselves. Their performance warranted to be lapped, and I knew of this already. I'm trying to follow you, but struggling. The general performance of F1 cars following each other under yellow does not seem to be an issue - if I'm following you correctly. Erasing the gaps allows for some actual racing between drivers, rather than the track itself. If the lead cars are indeed faster, the gaps being erased should not be of any concern."
formula1,3e283w,schneeb,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:23:58 2015 UTC,Well with these tires the gap they have/had is directly proportional to how much tire performance they have left.  If someone is trying to 1 stop and has a 20 second lead on the 2 stoppers and the safety erases that hes fucked (extreme example).
formula1,3e283w,langer39,0,Tue Jul 21 14:29:25 2015 UTC,So 1 lap before the safety car pulls off lapped cars don't get their lap back the simply on the pit straight or the back straight they simply drop to the back of the line.
formula1,3e283w,exceme,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:32:05 2015 UTC,"More enjoyable? Maybe.  But it'd be very artificial.  I'm for the best racers winning, not someone getting lucky with a safety car and their pit stop lining up perfectly."

It is clear that they felt there was no single cause.

formula1,3dzz61,twotonwhale,9,Tue Jul 21 10:47:43 2015 UTC,"Well, I respectfully disagree.  It was nothing more than a racing incident, and to me with the fault leaning more on Magnussen's side.  Massa could only see Bottas, same for Magnussen. Approaching the corner, Massa brakes to allow Bottas in front and continues normally on the racing line.  Magnussen did the same thing, except he was on the inside carrying a bit too much speed, but to reiterate, racing incident, neither driver drove into each other"
formula1,3dzz61,dpfagent,1 point,Tue Jul 21 10:55:09 2015 UTC,"The difference is that Massa would take zero fault for the incident and blamed Magnussen 100%.  In a race start you need to keep in lanes when unsure of other cars, he made an assumption nobody was on the inside and put his car there, but there was a car there."
formula1,3dzz61,Indestructavincible,-1,Tue Jul 21 11:04:24 2015 UTC,"Did Magnussen not blame Massa as well? What's your point?   In a race start you need to keep in lanes when unsure of other cars   Which is exactly what he did. Magnussen was the one trying to make a move, Massa was simply following the racing line. To me, the guy trying to make the move is the one who needs to be cautious   he made an assumption nobody was on the inside and put his car there, but there was a car there.   I already explained, he assumed Bottas was there, not Magnussen.  That's why Magnussen tried the same as well, he also couldn't see Massa because of Bottas.  What would be the alternative for either driver? They can't assume two cars every time, imagine if Magnussen wasn't there and Massa went straight out for no reason, or if Massa wasn't there and Magnussen braking twice as much to leave room for a car that wasn't there."
formula1,3dzz61,dpfagent,2,Tue Jul 21 11:16:46 2015 UTC,"3-4 other pairs of drivers went through that corner after Massa made contact, not a single driver who was on the outside cut to the inside of the corner presuming no one was there except for Massa.   At every race every year you have pairs of cars going through the first corner, sometimes 2-3 corners before everyone gets in single file. It's absolutely standard that before it becomes single file you can't just cut across the inside line onto the apex if you are on the outside line. No one else did it, drivers further back, none of them attempted the same thing but safely stayed on the outside and went through the corners wheel to wheel without any problems. Massa was literally the only drive to start on the outside and cut onto the inside line with absolutely no right to do so.  It was 100% Massa's fault, Magnussen wasn't carrying too much speed, he was on the inside line, Massa wasn't, Massa turned onto the inside line when there was a 99.8% chance of hitting someone.  http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/formula1/28427577  Watch the video, see how many other drivers started off wide, realised there is likely to be someone on the inside and not a one of them aimed for the apex, only Massa started wide and went for the apex and found a car there instead.   Almost every incident was his fault as well. Hitting Kimi, he locked up his rear wheels and with over half the track(the right side) empty he locked up, panicked spun his car and only the rear of the car hit Kimi. Had he not locked up he would have like the front of the car steered right and avoided any contact. The car in front of Massa with less reaction time managed to avoid Kimi. It wasn't Massa's fault Kimi was spinning around the track, but many drivers have avoided collisions with far less warning than he had. that collision was easily avoidable and should never have happened."

Bottas has Wihuri and Kemppi behind him, who bring a significant amount of money to the team. Hülkenberg has virtually nothing. Williams have made losses of €43m last year and will make losses again this year, despite the expected increase in price money. They need to increase their income to maintain their current level of spending in the long term, and signing a driver without significant sponsorship makes that even more difficult. Williams had to drop Hülkenberg after 2010, because they needed Maldonado's millions to compensate for the loss of three major sponsors. It might be the lack of money again, that prevents Hülkenberg from securing a drive with the team."

I'm saying that there are numbers that are hard to retire like number 1 that goes to the champion. But there is a lot of numbers that are free.

formula1,3dymsk,Tjolo,14,Mon Jul 20 19:57:39 2015 UTC,"MGU-H and MGU-K   MGU-K (where the ‘K’ stands for kinetic) works like an uprated version of the previous KERS, converting kinetic energy generated under braking into electricity (rather than it escaping as heat). It also acts as a motor under acceleration, returning up to 120kW (approximately 160bhp) power to the drivetrain from the Energy Store.   MGU-H (where the ‘h’ stands for heat)is an energy recovery system connected to the turbocharger of the engine and converts heat energy from exhaust gases into electrical energy. The energy can then be used to power the MGU-K (and thus returned to the drivetrain) or be retained in the ES for subsequent use. Unlike the MGU-K which is limited to recovering 2MJ of energy per lap, the MGU-H is unlimited. The MGU-H also controls the speed of the turbo, speeding it up (to prevent turbo lag) or slowing it down in place of a more traditional wastegate."

I remember Hamilton having to pit 3 times vs. everyone else on 2 in Turkey 2008, because he was taking too much out of them.

But his passing affected me so much as a 13 year old that I sought solace in the words written by those who knew him. Their words inspired me to become an F1 journalist.   For a generation of F1 fans, this will be their first real experience of a death within a sport which, while dangerous, people thankfully rarely associate death.   In trying to deal with my own emotions I spoke with a dear friend and mentor this morning, a man whose own writing about Senna was one of the reasons I wanted to become a journalist. He repeated a beautiful quote, that grief is the price we pay for loving someone.   You didn't need to have met Jules to love him. You don't need to have known him to grieve his passing."

To be honest I rarely pay attention to teams or drivers at the back but I kept hearing so many good things about Jules that I did pay attention to him from the start of 2013 with Marussia and saw what spectacular talent he had.     These past days I've tried to locate a handful of tweets I posted during 2013 and 2014 congratulating him about a good race or what not. A couple of them were faved by the Bianchi fans twitter acc IIRC but sadly it's proven to be nearly impossible with 3000+ tweets. Maybe I'm not searching my own tweets right or something but I digress.     I didn't have the pleasure of meeting him in person but I did follow closely his short F1 career thanks to you and other F1 journalists and commentators who always held him in high regard and for good reason.

I assume most riders think that the 98% survival rate is worth the risk to race on one of the world's greatest racing courses.   Personally, I would go for it.

Motoracing is probably the safest it has ever been, especially in cars. Yes, Jules' death was tragic and preventable (and led to some new safety innovation) but simultaneously, drivers now routinely walk away from crashes that would have been fatal in the past.

formula1,3dxfc7,xv323,13,Mon Jul 20 19:06:13 2015 UTC,I feel like saying Magnussen has 'failed to complete' 564 total laps is a bit unfair given he was only entered for a single race this season :P
formula1,3dxfc7,michaelsnutemacher,10,Mon Jul 20 15:56:55 2015 UTC,"Surprised that Mehri is that far up, in particular he's only one lap off from Raikönnen. Adjusting for lapped finishes (which have been 1-3 laps per race for the Manors), that would mean that Mehri's Manor has been more reliable than Raikönnens Ferrari.  Edit: got Merhi and Stevens confused, thanks /u/Beredo for the correction."
formula1,3dxfc7,Beredo,13,Mon Jul 20 10:07:34 2015 UTC,You seem to talk about Mehri. Kimis mising laps are from his collision in the first lap of Austria (not completing 71 laps) and his DNF in Melbourne in lap 41/58 because of a wheelnut that was cross threaded.  Mehri missed Melbourne and retired from Canada beacause of his power unit.  I don't think you can really say something about car reliability out of this.
formula1,3dxfc7,perfecttttt,1 point,Mon Jul 20 10:57:06 2015 UTC,Didnt Kimi accept the blame for that crash? I would consider reliability to also include the driver's reliability.
formula1,3dxfc7,Beredo,3,Mon Jul 20 17:55:58 2015 UTC,"Yeah, he did  Of course you are technically correct. You can say driver and car form an entity and geting the car to the chequered flag is also a form of reliability.   But as far as I can see /u/michaelsnutemacher focussed on the point that a backmarkers car is holding up against a top teams car in terms of technical reliability, while you would naturaly assume it would be the other way around."
formula1,3dxfc7,michaelsnutemacher,2,Mon Jul 20 18:20:51 2015 UTC,"Alright, the faults on Kimis end are definitely lesser than Mehri's troubles - in particular, driver fault being something that might happen to anyone now and then, and thus can be neglected so long as it's not a trend...  However, I still find the numbers interesting - not only is Mehri almost on par with Raikönnen, he's also ahead of both Lotuses, one Toro Rosso and one RedBull. That is a trend, and a surprising one. Granted, the fact that Manor is not too close to matching race pace may still mean that they're running a safer engine mode etc., but I think it deserves merit nonetheless."

formula1,3e1uj5,ColdHardMetal,10,Tue Jul 21 08:45:43 2015 UTC,"Here is the view from those seats.  You want the Kintetsu line, and Google Maps will tell you the route.  Use the Nankai Airport Express from Kansai International, head to Namba, transfer from Nankai to Kintetsu at Namba.  Have your friend book Limited Express reserved seats on Kintetsu for the times you want to go - the trains will pre-book filled with F1 fans, so book ASAP!  (you can change your departure time for reserved seats at the train station if you're early) Arrive 10m early for your train, leave 50 minutes for yourself to get from Shiroko station to Suzuka.  On race day there's a special limited express from Nagoya straight to the nearest train station, but again, that train sells out quick.  From the Kintetsu Shiroko station there are dedicated shuttle buses every 5-10 minutes that's only a few hundred yen. (couple a bucks)  There's a smaller station run by Ise Railway (Suzuka Inou) that's a bit of a hike to the track, but you don't need the buses.  The trains are small and infrequent however.  I recommend Shiroko. Book early early early early EARLY for hotels.  As in now.  If you run out of options in Nagoya do Osaka.  Nagoya is 1h 20m-ish from the track, Osaka is ~2h.  A bit long but not terrible. :)  (I should mention the Kintetsu line running between Nagoya and Osaka runs to Shiroko Station/Suzuka, so... either choice will get you there in 1 line as long as you get a hotel close enough to the Kintetsu station!)   With 5 hours you'll get there in time for quali.  Here was my field trip report, including suggestions on visiting Suzuka.  My #1 tip: If you at all possibly can, take extra days off and go Thursday and Friday.  The open part of the track is the start line straight, the esses, and Degner for the Thursday track walk.  After the race ends, the open part of the track is the hairpin, 130R, and Spoon, and doesn't last very long since the race ends near sundown and light fades fast.  It's also extremely nice to just sit where you want and walk around leisurely, without any big crowds and watch the cars go by during Free Practice instead of being confined to your seats during quali/race.  Here are my photo albums from Suzuka to get you primed for your awesome trip:   360* Photospheres of the views from almost all the grandstands - this should help immensely for which seat you should consider.  The grandstand/section names are in the photo description to the right of each panorama. Thursday/Pre-F1 photos FP photos Race day photos  incl. the shuttle buses and signage to give you an idea   It really is a beautiful track, and I encourage you to soak it all in with some extra days. :)  Bonus post: Here's my tips for photographing cars that I learned at Suzuka."

formula1,3dxn53,starwatto,30,Mon Jul 20 11:55:57 2015 UTC,"Yep. This is Massa who is stereotypically a n average to poor wet weather driver.  Of course it's easy to look good in the wet when you have a car with mountains of downforce, but even so he should be ahead of Felipe.  I know people criticize me as unfair on Bottas but I just can't see this guy as a potential great or a challenge to Vettel. The flashes of brilliance, let alone consistent brilliance are lacking for him to enter the potential champion category."

formula1,3dxn53,JoeyBACON,4,Tue Jul 21 13:08:12 2015 UTC,"Eh, this is why I have a problem with Bottas going to Ferrari.  They dumped massa, because he was drooping and Alonso as trouncing him.  Then they acquire Raikkonen, who is faster than massa (I don't see massa coming within a tenth of a second of Vettel in the same car...whilst Raikkonen still can when he is on the ball), but makes more mistakes.  Then you have bottas who goes back and forth with massa.  Neither are a #1 for williams.  Neither of them outshine each other.  This is why I find it odd to acquire bottas.  They need someone faster than bottas.  Yes, they need someone more consistent than raikkonen, but they need someone who is faster than massa and Bottas hardly is.  And he is about 27 IIRC.  At the same time...massa has a TBI (brain injury) from the spring.  And bottas still can't put himself as a clear cut #1 over him.    IMO...Williams probably has a damn good car.  Better than what it appears.  The way massa did at Ferrari towards the end of his time there (not too well, nothing stellar) and how he stacks up to other drivers in the field...imagine if Vettel or Hamilton were in a Williams.  If this is what bottas and massa can do in that car...no doubt Vettel and guys of the sort could squeeze a fair bit more out of it.  Bottas will always be a #2 in f1 as long as he is at a top tier team, because they will undoubtedly have at least one all star already.  Bottas is solid, but I just don't see the talent in him to win a WDC.  There will always be guys like Vettel, Hamilton, Alonso, and Raikkonen who are in their prime that he is competing with until he retires.  Whether it is them specifically or guys that turn out to be all stars just like those aforementioned."

This is why I find it odd to acquire bottas. They need someone faster than bottas.   Agreed. If he was a potential top driver he'd be beating Massa more consistently imo. I think he will do a better job than Raikkonen, but just due to consistency and his qualifying pace.   IMO...Williams probably has a damn good car. Better than what it appears. The way massa did at Ferrari towards the end of his time there (not too well, nothing stellar) and how he stacks up to other drivers in the field...imagine if Vettel or Hamilton were in a Williams. If this is what bottas and massa can do in that car...no doubt Vettel and guys of the sort could squeeze a fair bit more out of it.   Assuming the Alonso-Massa gap was anything like at Ferrari I think its safe to say Alonso would have won races in the 2014-2015 Williams. Which must irk the team.   Bottas will always be a #2 in f1 as long as he is at a top tier team, because they will undoubtedly have at least one all star already.   They would have went for Ricciardo if they wanted a driver to challenge/beat Vettel. I think at this point its clear they wanted a solid number 2 who is more solid than Raikkonen."

Kind of hard to keep control of an already slippery car in the wet without a bit of rear downforce.  Otherwise, from what we've seen, his wet form in the past has been just fine.

formula1,3dxn53,lintstah1337,-11,Mon Jul 20 12:05:01 2015 UTC,"Bottas is starting to get on my nerves with his constant criticism. That shit won't fly at Ferrari. Alosno used to say 1/10th of this and Ferrari was livid.   Then again, if he joins them, he is joining as a most definite No.2, so I guess he is in for a bit of a shock soon"
formula1,3dxn53,FAFASGR,10,Mon Jul 20 13:45:49 2015 UTC,"He was likely asked a direct question about Williams wet form.  Alonso, Kimi, Massa have all criticized their cars as bad when they were bad.  You know all these statements, like ALL of them, are extracted via questions from media right?  Would you prefer he doesn't speak his mind when asked like a silly robot?  Massa also backs up what he says.  I don't understand why people don't think they should be critical of their rides when asked."
formula1,3dxn53,Indestructavincible,-2,Mon Jul 20 14:01:28 2015 UTC,"Yes, of course he is asked them, thats not the point. I don't want a robot, but going on record saying your team will never win a championship is just extremely unprofessional (not this article, a previous one). Everyone is in F1 because they ultimately dream of winning, even Manor. And he basically shat on them. And this article just adds to it for me."
formula1,3dxn53,FAFASGR,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:05:17 2015 UTC,"So when asked a direct question about the car's performance, what do you think he should have said?  Do you have a source for your article, 'on record'?  Because based on the well trained in the media Bottas, he would say no such thing.  He would say however that ""Williams in its current form can not challenge for a championship"" because it's the harsh truth.  Williams is not his family, he does not have to spend his whole career there and spite his hopes for a championship that won't come while he is in his prime.  There are other drivers on Williams radar, and if Bottas wants a championship he needs to make sure he is in the right place.  RIght now Williams is not that place, despite the delusion Massa is laboring under.  Massa will retire, at Williams, with no WDC.  Williams future title shots means they need more budget building and consistent results in the mean time.  Bottas knows this, is a contracted driver, and looking for a better contract to further his career.  Nico could have stayed with Williams too, but clearly he made the right choice.  There are lots of drivers who can do the same job as he is in a team not at the front.  He thinks his career is more important than Williams keeping him.  He's right."

formula1,3e0vpo,Racer1,11,Tue Jul 21 02:31:04 2015 UTC,NFL teams have budget caps.   Why should someone like Manor get equal pay as someone like Ferrari who spends way more?
formula1,3e0vpo,metamorphomisk,4,Tue Jul 21 02:35:48 2015 UTC,"They shouldn't, however, they should be paid something equatable to their position within the Constructors Championship. I get the whole ""pay to play"", but when you don't even pay the 11th team, then you're constantly flirting with the fiasco we had last season with Marussia & Caterham not being able to continue. F1 needs to think about building from within. i know it's beating a dead horse, but I thought it was interesting to show how the NFL has maintained relative growth, while still supporting the teams that comprise the league. Although the NFL has had it's own PR mess over the last few years, as a whole it is still as strong as it's ever been."
formula1,3e0vpo,metamorphomisk,4,Tue Jul 21 02:43:08 2015 UTC,"hey should be paid something equatable to their position within the Constructors Championship.   I agree with this. But your title something different than this comment. Your title, i dont agree with"

formula1,3e0vpo,metamorphomisk,0,Tue Jul 21 08:13:34 2015 UTC,Ugh. Of course not.   You adjust the rules to work with such a system. Enforce the 107% rule strictly then only get paid per race qualified for.
formula1,3e0vpo,DoomHawk,3,Tue Jul 21 08:19:19 2015 UTC,So it's more than just splitting money. The initial comment I made was talking about OP's title.
formula1,3e0vpo,jetshockeyfan,0,Tue Jul 21 08:28:11 2015 UTC,"You're being deliberately obtuse. OP's title didn't say that this one change would magically fix F1, just stating that in the NFL you have 32 teams competing against each other, year after year, bringing in billions, and yet the league itself and even the worst teams get a huge chunk of the overall money generated by the league as a whole.  The teams who are winning don't typically and shouldn't need the money just for existing. If you're winning, people will pay to sponsor you because they'll get exposure.  Case in point: Marlboro doesn't even get a logo on the damn car and they pay Ferrari a small fortune every year to sponsor the team. Yet Ferrari gets the biggest yearly pay day just for existing. Why?  I'm not saying to create a system which rewards ineptitude, but if the way to improve an F1 team is spend money on dev and the teams at the back have barely enough money to make each race while the front spends buckets of money every day, that gap will always grow and the back teams will have no way of getting higher up the grid to win the prize money they need to develop and get higher up the grid.  I think a system where the top half of the CC collectively share about 30% of the prize money based on the points they scored (with a single %5 bonus amount paid to the winner of the CC) and the bottom shares about 50% of the prize money, prioritized by finishing position regardless of points, it would incentivize everyone to succeed while getting backmarker teams the money they need to develop and try to catch up.  Basing the top teams' (anyone finishing in the top half of constructors is a 'top team') payments on the points they earned (EXTREME hypothetical: say the prize pool for the top teams is 100 Mil and 1000 points were scored by the combination of all the top teams. This means each point scored is worth .1 Mil) rather than their finishing position incentivizes every team to push as hard as possible every race, even if their finishing position won't change. This prevents the last 'top team' tanking to try and get more money by being the 'best of the worst', and also promotes strong racing for every point at every GP on the calendar.  Anyway, that's my two cents, and still right in line with OP's title."

It get/got away with calling itself a 'non profit' because the NFL doesn't make any profits.  The NFL corporate structure exists to collect money from ticket sales, television rights and licensing deals.  It then uses that money to pay the people who run the NFL (refs/comissioners/staff etc) and then redistrubute all the remaining money earned to the 32 teams that make up the league.  Taxes are then paid by the 32 teams which do make a profit. The NFL as a corporate entity does not make a profit.  The NFL as a whole does make a profit and pays a lot of tax.  This is in contrast to CVC/Other owners of Formula 1 who straight up keep ~25% of the revenue for themselves, give 60% to the teams and use the rest for running costs."

formula1,3e0vpo,Phineasfogg,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:17:56 2015 UTC,"Another pay debate.   If I understand the pay structure in F1, the teams get paid a set amount based on their overall contribution to Formula 1, and then on their position in the constructors table.  Your boss at work makes more money than you for two reasons; the first because they've been there longer than you, and the second because they probably do more work than you.*  *Unless your boss is a dickhead."
formula1,3e0vpo,MR_Rictus,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:25:18 2015 UTC,"I think the main takeaway from this is that the NFL takes care of its own. It knows how important each team is to the league as a whole.   In regards to F1, while I agree that the World Championship winning team should get a higher share, there's nothing wrong with paying the the smaller teams a share of the pot. It only increases the competitiveness of the sport, as the teams have more spending money to either develop the car, or seek out a class driver."

If you look at how a lot of these teams operate, their business units are driven more by ""passion"" than sustainable business models.  No one ""tricked"" Marussia or Lotus into thinking this is an easy sport to make money in. All teams understand the difficulties and risks. I think you're going to see Haas Formula 1 come in and show everyone how a conservative, structured approach to the F1 business model can achieve success.  90% of restaurants in the US are out of business in the first 3 years, but people continue to open them every day.

Yes the cars would be faster but I highly doubt the competition would be better. Even with the caps and the engine freeze I still consider this to be the pinnacle of motorsport over wec.   I think the path we're in right now makes for a more  sustainable sport. We do need to get rid of the engine freeze and start deviding the revenues more equally in order to balance the field a bit.

The only good thing backmarker teams like HRT or Marussia can do is providing a learning spot for drivers in a learning program for a big team.

That's fantastic for teams as when you are in the front it's great that other teams are limited generally by their R&D as well as time and effort during setup let alone the driver. If you want competition which all fans do, you'd be looking at other series such as NASCAR and IndyCar that have done better since they focused on getting a competitive field first.  I don't think you should look down on the back markers, it's a by product of F1 and if anything it's amazing they're even there. Not everyone has the budget Ferrari,Mercedes, Williams have so in a series where budget determines the competitiveness then you can be surprised that not everyone had the same resources.

formula1,3dvtp9,Jason3211,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:52:34 2015 UTC,"TBH in this current rules era im not sure you can really put the blame on management. If the money needed to actually show up is much more than the sponsorship + prize money dollars coming in no amount of financial wizardry can cover that hole for long.  When even a barebones team like Marussia has to spend at least $50 million (engines, chassis, personnel) or so just to run around at the back of the field with very little airtime its no wonder that so many are in trouble."
formula1,3dvtp9,roflcopter44444,2,Mon Jul 20 16:24:17 2015 UTC,"Why is it the sports problem that teams are spending outside of their means.  They need to cut costs in how they go about racing, if that makes them less competitive, than so be it, that is kind of how it works.  You see football clubs going into recievership due to borrowing/spending more than they can afford. Leeds in the early 2000's is the perfect example. Yet we don't see people saying we need to change football."

Teams have been dying since formula 1 began (And at a much higher rate than recent history), this isn't a new phenomenon.  If we make the sport cheaper, they will still outspend their means, nothing will change.  The ones that run terrible business models are making their own bed."
formula1,3dvtp9,HandsomeBadger,3,Mon Jul 20 06:29:21 2015 UTC,"You think that we'll be down to 4 teams soon?  Are you kidding?  Ok, so Manor will be out after this year.

So even if red bull stays in F1 it's likely that they won't support two teams in the near future. But it's likely that Toro Rosso is quite more expensive then other teams currently."
formula1,3dvtp9,bTrixy,3,Mon Jul 20 11:52:37 2015 UTC,"Sauber, Lotus, Force India (they become the backmarkers), Williams (in 2014 they announced a 34 million euro loss, could easily happen again) and finally RedBull/Toro Rosso (not for money but Mateschitz isn't happy and might leave).  Just wanted to have some fun, losing 5 teams is easy F1 is very volatile, dozens (if not hundreds) of teams died, very few succeeded. But it will never have only 4 teams, more teams will join as they always did:  We'll already have Haas and Renault, and that's without any of the teams above even dropping out yet"

formula1,3dvtp9,sprulz,11,Mon Jul 20 17:40:16 2015 UTC,"In Formula 1 circles that's a pretty insignificant debt. I'm sure a lot of creditors in the Formula 1 specific industry would love to only have to be chasing $1m worth - that that's likely not a single debtor.  And we're talking outstanding since 19 May, so they've barely hit 90 days in arrears on those debts.  I'm tempted to label this as a non-story."
formula1,3dvtp9,tjsr,2,Mon Jul 20 05:18:10 2015 UTC,Non-story except that we've had 3 weeks in between races. We gotta have something to talk about...
formula1,3dvtp9,Jason3211,9,Mon Jul 20 06:07:11 2015 UTC,Can anyone who's an accountant or who knows way more about money than I do explaing the following to me.      Costs were cut by $5 million but interest payments on the inter-company loans increased from $1 million to $22.6 million.
formula1,3dvtp9,AlexatRF21,13,Mon Jul 20 02:41:48 2015 UTC,"Not an accountant, but have a finance degree.  Costs being cut by $5 million is pretty straightforward: they are spending $5 million less than they used to for running the team/operations.  As far as the loans go, here are a few thoughts:  1) First off, it's an ""inter-company"" loan is where one business unit or the holding company itself ""loans"" money to a different division of the corporation.  This is convenient for a few reasons like not needing due-diligence for credit, cash available on very short notice, repayment terms can be much more flexible than with a commercial  lender.  2) The most likely scenario is not that the $22.6 million in interest payments is high, but that the original $1 million was very low.  Since this is one part of a company borrowing cash from another part of the company, the unit loaning the money most likely charged very little interest to the F1 group. Moreover, the payments could have been ""interest only"".  3) While the article says ""interest payments,"" I highly doubt the $22.6m is interest only.  What is most likely is that their low-interest, interest-only loan was serviced by $1m in payments and as soon as Lotus got back on their feet, they upped the interest to a realistic rate and then added principle repayment in.  4) Also a possibility, that since Lotus was a bit broke when they needed the loan, there could have been a lot of ""deferred"" interest that was pushed back a few years.  This means that when Lotus could start paying it back, they aren't only paying for the current interest, but making up for the back interest that they didn't have the cash flow to service."

EDIT: Question, might be a silly one: I just watched the Italian Grand Prix, and on the start/finish straight Bottas had a huge amount of overtakes. During a lot of them the cars he overtook moved quickly to the right and ""let"" Bottas continue straight using all the momentum from the slipstream. Was this a defensive move gone wrong, as in they were trying to predict Bottas going right to get the inside of the first corner and cutting him off, or were they being nice seeing how much more pace he has and let him though? The latter seems pretty lame and unlikely, but it kind of looked that way on several occasions."
formula1,3dybmm,skd444,2,Tue Jul 21 02:47:59 2015 UTC,"Its not a silly question.  You can only move once when defending, so most drivers choose to defend the inside.

formula1,3dw2e4,Insert_Nickname,33,Mon Jul 20 14:25:34 2015 UTC,"The main issue is you coming in at a break. Next week is the Hungary Grand Prix, then a three week break before Belgium.  Besides that issue, not really. It's going to be pretty sad for a while, but it should pick up soon.  If you are just looking for racing though, I suggest either going back and watching old races (someone should have the link somewhere) or watch the last couple of INDYCAR races left this season."

formula1,3dw2e4,Willham89,20,Mon Jul 20 10:24:12 2015 UTC,"Nope!  The constructor's championship is almost certainly wrapped up, but technically no one is mathematically eliminated, not even poor Kevin Magnussen in the driver's championship :)  Seriously, the top of the driver's championship is still highly competitive, as it was last year, between Mercedes drivers Hamilton and Rosberg.  Last year was very exciting and went down to the final race.  I'm hoping for the same this year.  In any case, it's never too early to start learning the teams, drivers, circuits, and particular rules of the series.  There's a race next Sunday; unfortunately after that there is a month-long summer break; the next race after next week is August 23.    You still get to see a lot of great tracks this year, too: Spa, Monza, Singapore (street course, but a beautiful night race), Suzuka's figure-8, Austin, Brazil, and Abu Dhabi (a dusk race around a .01% marina; more beautiful than a great track).  There's also a wild card left this year - a return to Mexico after a 23-year absence."
formula1,3dw2e4,emeksv,6,Mon Jul 20 01:21:36 2015 UTC,"I don't mean to sound like an asshole, but the fact that a championship where pretty much all but two drivers where discounted at race one is described as highly competitive makes me sad."
formula1,3dw2e4,catmilker,4,Mon Jul 20 08:36:39 2015 UTC,"it is sad, but people tend to forget that is the norm in F1, going back 30 years almost every season has a dominant chassis by far, usually the one spending the most bucks unless it is a Toyota,  but as always  there are still some great midfield battles with good drivers to follow. Maybe the history books just remember the WDC or WCC, but it is the midfield racing that has kept me watching F1 for as long as I have."
formula1,3dw2e4,Kymeera,3,Mon Jul 20 10:41:44 2015 UTC,Well its better than a 2011/2013 2002/2004 Vettel and Schumacher dominance where both championships are wrapped up after a few races.

formula1,3dw2e4,catmilker,0,Mon Jul 20 11:41:36 2015 UTC,2 drivers on the same team fighting for the title doesn't really qualify as highly competitive. 2010 was highly competitive; 2014 and 15 are not.
formula1,3dw2e4,Nikiaf,2,Mon Jul 20 11:59:15 2015 UTC,"If you're going to rule out two excellent drivers in the same car who have been mostly within a single race win of switching positions for the past one and a half seasons as uncompetitive, then I guess I can't help you.  I agree that 2010 was amazing; I can't imagine anyone arguing otherwise, except possibly Alonso.  But it's more competitive than a single breakout, which is what seems to happen more often.  For examples, just look at either 2009 or 2011."

formula1,3dw2e4,romiik,5,Mon Jul 20 22:06:52 2015 UTC,"I've been following since last year's season and I'm obsessed. And last year's season seems to be considered as ""dull"" to most long-time fans, as is this year's. Yet I still seem to get a ton of enjoyment out of it.   That said, I have the following recommendations:    Watch Sky's broadcast if you can. It's easily the best. BBC comes in as a close second, but they don't attend every race. If you're in the 'states, avoid NBC. The commentary is sub-par and there are commercials mid-race.  If you have a decent PC or video game console, pick up an F1 game, or any game that has most of the F1 tracks. F1 sims/games (and gaming in general) get a lot of flak from this sub, as they are seen as off-topic, but I can't disagree more: I see them as very relevant, and almost essential to maximize enjoyment of each race, as you can memorize every corner of a track in just an hour or so with one of those games/sims. This isn't like football, where you can run outside with some friends and learn the rules and flow of the game that way. Sims are the best we've got. That said, avoid F1 2015... it's garbage so far (bugs).  Watch with friends. We have a pretty big group that gets together, and we turn each race into a sort-of ""pot-luck"", with food and beer themed on the location that weekend. It's been a huge hit, and it's made quite a few new fans out of my friends.  Watch the season re-caps if you want a quick cliff-notes on who's who, where everyone was last year, and get a general feel for each of the teams. 2014 would be a good place for you to start:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_0zMVaWl6c   EDIT: Also make sure to catch the last race- the 2015 British GP at Silverstone. Arguably the best race this year."
formula1,3dw2e4,Teslatic,3,Mon Jul 20 04:24:02 2015 UTC,"I would also suggest you watch some old races, the beginner page recommends a few."
formula1,3dw2e4,SirIrishLad,3,Mon Jul 20 01:02:01 2015 UTC,"I'll try to make this as unbiased and as relatively detailed as possible  .  Mercedes  Currently on top of the constructors championship and has won every race bar 1 so far. Lewis Hamilton is currently leading the drivers championship, with Nico Rosberg second. They have had the occasional fall-out due to various issues last year, however, less have happened this year. Lewis won the championship last year, as well as in 2008. Nico nearly won last year, however fell at the last hurdle when reliability issues happened in the final race.  .  Ferrari  If you consider that Mercedes are most likely to come 1st and 2nd in a race (It doesn't happen all of the time though), Ferrari is one of the teams who are contending for 3rd and 4th. Sebastian Vettel has won 1 race earlier this year, and Kimi Raikkonnen nearly won another race a few races after Vettel's win. Vettel came from Red Bull last year to join Ferrari this year. Kimi has been part of the team for a while, and is well-known for his honesty on Team Radio.  .  Williams  Williams is, like Ferrari another contender for 3rd and 4th. Williams have not won a race this year, however, was leading at the start of the British Grand Prix a couple weeks ago. Felipe Massa is one of their drivers and is one of the 'veterans' of the sport. He nearly won the title in 2008, but lost when Lewis Hamilton overtook an ex-driver Timo Glock on one of the final corners. Valterri Bottas is a relatively new driver in the grand scheme of things. He's currently rumoured to be replacing Kimi at Ferrari next year, however, nothing has been confirmed.  .  Red Bull  Red Bull are currently leading the mid-field teams, with their drivers Daniel Ricciardo and Daniil Kvyat placing 7th and 8th (respectively) in the Drivers Championship. They've been mainly having issues with their engine manufacturer this year, and have had unreliability at some races. Daniel Ricciardo won 3 races last year as well as outperforming his then-team-mate Vettel. He is also known for having a very large smile. Daniil Kvyat is new to Red Bull this year, and has done relatively well in the grand scheme of things.  .  Force India  Now we're entering the territory of where the mid-field teams are about equally matched. The first being Force India. They've got a unique nose design at the moment, and occasionally get into the top 5 in a race. Nico Hulkenberg,  their first driver, has been in the sport for 5 years. He had a pole in 2010, was a test driver in 2011 and fully re-entered the sport in 2012. He's been rumoured to be joining the likes of Ferrari numerous times over the years. This however, has been proven wrong every year. Sergio Perez is their 2nd driver. He's been in numerous teams over the years, including Sauber and McLaren. He's currently 9 points behind his team-mate Hulkenberg  .  Lotus  Another mid-field team, occasionally does pretty well in a race despite their position in the championship. Romain Grosjean is currently 10th in the drivers championship and more-often-than-not outperforms his team-mate. He hasn't won a race in his career yet, however, was infamous in 2012 for causing numerous accidents, including this one which earnt him a race ban. However, that crash-streak is over. Then we get onto Pastor Maldonado who is slightly more prone to accidents and even has a website dedicated to that fact . He's also chosen the race number 13 for the remainder of his career as well. Despite this nature, he has won a race in his career, which his team-mate Grosjean hasn't achieved.  .  Sauber  Possibly the most noticeable car due to it's livery, Sauber currently has it's drivers 11th and 16th in the Championship. It has had a spell of bad years and a points-less year in 2014. However, it is doing better this year. They also had a whole problem at the start of this year with who is driving from them when they signed 3 drivers, but only had 2 places (The other driver being Giedo Van Der Garde). Felipe Nasr, not to be confused with Felipe Massa is currently 11th in the championship. He is a rookie for this year and has been outperforming his team-mate Marcus Ericsson. Ericsson has been in the sport for slightly longer, and had a drive with the ex-team Caterham.  .  Toro Rosso  The sister-team of Red Bull, Toro Rosso is seen as the feeder team for drivers who want to drive for Red Bull. They have also had problems with the engine manufacturer due to the fact that Red Bull and Toro Rosso have the same engine manufacturer (Renault). Max Verstappen is currently 14th in the championship, and is a rookie as well. He is well known for being the youngest F1 driver ever (at the age of 17), and will probably keep that title as there is a new rule which is going to be introduced next year to stop drivers younger than 18 getting on the grid. If he gets on the podium before 30th September, he cannot legally drink the champagne due to his age. Carlos Sainz Jnr. is also a rookie to the sport. He is currently 15th in the championship, only 1 point behind his team-mate.  .  McLaren Honda  This team has had a bad spell over the past few years. This year, to improve their chances of getting the championship, they've decided to change engines from Mercedes to Honda (As their philosophy is that Mercedes know their engine the best, so no-one can beat Mercedes with a Mercedes engine). The engine hasn't done quite as well as they would've hoped, and as a result have had several non-finishes due to reliability. Jenson Button is the most experienced driver on the field, as he started his career in 2000. He's gone through several teams (Williams, Benneton, Renault, Honda, BAR Honda, Brawn) and won the Championship in 2009 with Brawn. He also won a race in 2011 which is often noted as the best F1 race by many fans. Fernando Alonso is also another veteran of the sport, and joined McLaren from Ferrari under the same ethos that McLaren had with their change of engine to Honda. He won 2 Championships in 2005 and 2006, nearly won in 2010 and 2012. However, those 2 near-wins have been lost to Vettel.  .  Manor  The team that nearly never happened. They originally started off as Virgin in 2010, changed their name to Marussia to fit their Chassis in 2012 and then had monetary issues late in 2014. They're currently in the news a fair bit at the moment due to Jules Bianchi. If you want to know about this, there is a wealth of articles on r/formula1 explaning. Both Roberto Merhi and Will Stevens are rookies and have placed last of those who finished every race. They have been improving over the races, however, still have a long way to go.  Hope that's enough to get you in-the-know about F1 at the moment. It's a cracking sport! Feel free to ask if I mentioned something that you are unsure about.  :-)"
formula1,3dw2e4,theballaam96,2,Mon Jul 20 12:42:45 2015 UTC,"""Nico nearly won last year, however fell at the last hurdle when reliability issues happened in the final race.""  That's not very clear, to anyone else it would seem like Nico was leading the race to win the championship and his car suddenly broke down. The last hurdle would have been beating Lewis by the 17 points he needed going into that race. It didn't look like he was doing enough to overcome it, reliability issues or not.  Everything else is spot on."

formula1,3dw2e4,theballaam96,2,Mon Jul 20 19:18:50 2015 UTC,"It's never too late to start getting into a season of F1, imo.  The kind ladies and gents here will be able to fill you in on anything you might want to know about the season so far and the sport in general.  The constructors championship will no doubt go to Mercedes again this year as their dominance has continued since 2014, but the drivers championship is still up for grabs. The WDC (World Drivers' Championship) is very close between Nico Rosberg and Lewis Hamilton at the moment. Both are very closely matched in ability and are on the same Mercedes team, so they have the same car.  To find a team or driver you can support will probably take a while, I personally find myself supporting a good 90% of the grid as I have a lot of respect for their skill and dedication.  You'll probably want to check out the Practice sessions and the Qualifying and Race pre & post shows to get the most information and help understand some of the sports finer details. Also, in the coming months we'll start to get a bit more information coming out about the grid for next year. Driver changes and signings, plus Haas is entering the grid next year potentially with another US team if things come together, so there will be a home team for the Americans to support.

formula1,3dw2e4,mrcandyman,-2,Mon Jul 20 01:30:52 2015 UTC,"edit: the first thing you need to know is that if you express a dissenting opinion in this subreddit you'll get downvoted  Little primer from someone who is far less knowledgeable than everyone else here-  Mercedes is dominating this year, as they did. The big ""rivalry"" is between their 2 drivers, lewis hamilton and **nico rosberg. Hamilton won the driver's championship last year and is blisteringly fast. Rosberg came 2nd, and it's hard not to feel like the team sees him as the ""number 2"" driver. Hamilton can seem pretty douchy, whereas rosberg seems nice.  Sebastian Vettel dominated for several years in the dominating Red Bull car. After Red Bull took a turn for the worst last year (slow car), Vettel jumped ship to Ferrari, which is a bit of a dream for many drivers.  Williams is one of the great old teams. they had a few bad years a few years ago, but have come back as one of the most lovable teams and are Threatenning to take 2nd place off Ferrari.   Mercedes is so dominant that everyone knows that they'll come #1, so 2nd is ""the best of the rest""  Although fast, Williams keeps tripping over itself on strategy..  Ferrari is Vettel and Kimi. Everyone loves Kimi because they think he's hilarious, but really he's overplayed and past his used by date  skip a few mid-field teams...  mclaren-honda. Honda has returned to F1 after a long absense, making engines for McLaren. Their engines sound cool but... witghout several years of development (like the other engine manufacturers), they're slow and break a lot. As a result, they're coming 2nd last. McLaren is driven by Fernando Alonso and Jenson Button- both former world champions.  Finally, Manor-Marrusia. Marrusia was one of the ""backmarker"" teams (ie, teams that you only ever expect to finish last), but last year amazingly Jules Bianchi scored 2 points for them. Points are worth a lot of money, so even though they went bankrupt at the end of the season last year, those 2 points have allowed them to live on.  Jules Biianchi was unfortunately in a horrible incident at the Sazuka race last year which put him into a coma for several months and he finally died a few days ago.  So, who to support? I support Williams because they're a fun and fast team. It's so frustrating to watch them sabotage races on bad strategy. I support Manor because I love the underdog, but supporting them is more a matter of ""woooo! they showed manor on the screen for 5 seconds!, because they're far slower than everyone else. They're so broke that they're even using last year's engines .  Finally, I support McLaren because I love that Honda has returned to F1 and it's fun being excited about former World champions potentially scoring points"

Its because there are so many people who almost seem to be ashamed of the sport. What kind of message does that send to the world? What does it tell potential fans? We have one bad half of a year and now suddenly everyone is screaming ""oh my god this sport fucking sucks"". Don't be ashamed of this sport. I present it proudly to my friends who don't follow F1. I have gotten several of my friends in to F1. One of them is following it for the first time this year and he loves it. If you want super close racing then go watch a spec series. The racing itself has almost never attracted people to F1. Its the technology, the competing manufacturers, the high stage drama. I want you to be proud of the is sport but if half a year of ""boring"" racing is enough to make you start complaining then I'm not sure you should be following this sport in the first place."

formula1,3dw2e4,TheodoreP,1 point,Mon Jul 20 06:39:47 2015 UTC,"To be honest most people support a driver, or a group of drivers in F1. I only have a Mclaren flair so I don't get accused of bias in my comments. I support Button, Hamilton, Hulkenberg and Verstappen for example. Only Ferrari fans truly support the team. Of course many people will be different, but in reality barely anyone cares about the constructors championship."
formula1,3dw2e4,TheodoreP,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:08:50 2015 UTC,So what do people care about?
formula1,3dw2e4,SpiralStaircaseMan,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:24:54 2015 UTC,"The drivers championship. In F1 there are two championships. The driver Championship, where the winner is the driver with the most points by the end of the season, and the constructors championship, which is the total amount of points won by a team's drivers. The constructors is where the prize money is won, so it is important, but all the glory comes from the drivers championship. Here is a video of Ferrari thinking they'd won both championships in 2008. About 9 seconds in however, they realize they've only won the constructors. They don't look very happy do they? When Ferrari win there's a huge commotion on this sub reddit but if it's someone else, normally all the focus is on the driver. A lot of people don't support a team because F1 is not like Football(Soccer) where the team is a representation of you, teams change names, get better, get worse, get different drivers or go bankrupt. You might decide to support Red Bull, but in 4 years time they might be a completely different team, called Audi or something. Choose a driver you like, whether it might be their style, their personality, their sportsmanship, then you might become attached to a team overtime.  TL;DR  In F1, the drivers are the stars, not the teams."

They are now crying because they have a crap car and a crap engine and are crying to the press about the crap engine instead of the crap car.   They are also crying to have the rules changed to ""the car made by red bull wins."" Some would even argue that they really rather aggressively find loopholes in the rules to the extent that they somewhat cheat (see the flexible wings hidden behind rubber last year).  The management are all utter mollusks of the highest degree, their attitude stinks and they very clearly aren't in it for the sport.

formula1,3e00lw,Mus7ache,7,Mon Jul 20 22:28:32 2015 UTC,That and in the wet cars can aquaplane which means the speed of impact can be greater even if the original speed isn't.
formula1,3e00lw,oh84s,6,Tue Jul 21 01:06:05 2015 UTC,"Even if the cars are going slower in the rain, Bianchi's crash showed that even at those (slightly) reduced speeds crashes can have terrible consequences (and remember, he was going even slower because he was at the yellow flags). The thing with rain is that it makes it much more likely for there to be a crash in the first place and crashes are often concentrated at one part of the track which makes it very dangerous for marshalls removing cars from previous crashes. Consider the 2007 European Grand Prix where something like five cars ended up in the gravel at turn 1 after it turned into a river."
formula1,3e00lw,thelb4,3,Mon Jul 20 22:31:43 2015 UTC,"Well Bianchi hit a crane, it's not about the rain. If that vehicle wasn't there he would have been as fine as Sutil was.  The European grand-prix crashes were very lights, like you can see on the video only a few cars hit the wall. The intervention of the Marshalls is a rule issue and not about the rain isn't it ?"
formula1,3e00lw,thelb4,5,Mon Jul 20 22:37:18 2015 UTC,I would bet there isn't one example in the history of Formula 1 where somebody has crashed in the dry and then the next lap while under yellow flags somebody else crashed at the same spot. And yet that happens a lot more frequently in the rain. Your premise is that 'crashes in the rain are safe(r) because they're driving slowly' - and yet this is easily shown to be false with reference to Bianchi.  Watch this video of Nürburgring 2007 and you'll see what I mean with cars one after the other going off. Yes they're not slamming into the wall at 200kmh but that doesn't make it safe - it's not difficult to imagine one of those cars hitting a marshal or another driver who's ended up at the same point.
formula1,3e00lw,thelb4,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:44:06 2015 UTC,"Once again Bianchi crashed a crane, it's a rule issue not a rain issue. And once again the intervention of the marshall and the crane at Nurburgring without all cars under safety car is, as well, a rule issue. The fact is, all cars crashed like babies in a bed. Have the driver stay in their cars till the safety car gets everyone and there it is."
formula1,3e00lw,xpen25x,3,Mon Jul 20 22:47:39 2015 UTC,"Are you saying that you would have stricter rules for crashes during the rain so that the safety car is brought out sooner and the recovery doesn't start until the safety car is out? In which case, how is that not an admission that rain makes F1 more dangerous?"
formula1,3e00lw,Carjunkie599,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:53:14 2015 UTC,"Crashes under rain happen more often that on the dry, which doesn't mean the crashes themselves are more dangerous. My point is, there is much more risk of an unpredictable huge crash on the dry than on the wet, where simple rules can be applied to easily avoid any dangerous situation."
formula1,3e00lw,WiredKiwi,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:08:16 2015 UTC,i believe the sc was just deployed as bianchi went off track. again the issue is racing to the yellow to slow this is why the vsc works
formula1,3e00lw,ilikebigsandwiches,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:13:34 2015 UTC,"I think the thing you aren't taking into account is variables.  The rain adds a huge variable to racing, which is already a giant mass of variables.  You can plan for things, make as many rules as you want, but somewhere down the line, a rule will be ignored, broken, etc.  In situations where its raining, you're simply making that specific situation more dangerous."
formula1,3e00lw,xpen25x,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:19:25 2015 UTC,"and rain itself is variable - one moment there's X grip on a spot of tarmac, next moment it's Y. Bianchi patently found a spot that didn't have the grip required for the speed he was going. Sutil had found that spot a lap earlier. Possibly at many other places on the tarmac he would have been able to stop at the speed he was going, just not that spot."
formula1,3e00lw,myurr,2,Tue Jul 21 00:23:42 2015 UTC,"he was going even slower because he was at the yellow flags   Or he wasn't, enough, which was the problem."
formula1,3e00lw,dl064,1 point,Tue Jul 21 08:08:03 2015 UTC,the problem isnt just cut and dry. several factors played into it.    is racing to the yellow to slow.  a vehicle that was higher then the cockpit of the f1 car allowing it to submarine speed   the rain really wasnt all that bad. id have to go back and watch it but i didnt think it was that bad. and you have 2 flags a green and a yellow flag. the drivers will race until the yellow then slow. problem is he went off right before the yellow if i remember correctly. had bianchi not hit the crane he would have most likely killed several corner workers.
formula1,3e00lw,dl064,2,Tue Jul 21 00:11:41 2015 UTC,"had bianchi not hit the crane he would have most likely killed several corner workers   It that final sentence that most people overlook, along with not acknowledging the FIA had been too lenient on the speeds drivers were taking through waved yellow sections.  All they had to do was lift slightly on the throttle, costing a tenth or two, and the FIA wouldn't investigate further giving the drivers no incentive to drive with the safety of the marshals in mind.  Thankfully the virtual safety car has been introduced and appears to work pretty well in giving the drivers definitive guidance on how fast they can drive.  Had this been in place during that fateful Japanese GP then it's unlikely Bianchi would have left the track in the way he did."
formula1,3e00lw,NZImmo,5,Tue Jul 21 10:19:03 2015 UTC,"Kubica once overtook Heidfeld in rain so bad neither of them was aware he had made an overtake. Button said that once he drove an f1 car in the wet, he looked at fellow f1 drivers differently as he now realized they were patently insane.   So yes, there are risks in the rain."

formula1,3dy3rr,DAL1189,8,Mon Jul 20 14:07:47 2015 UTC,"Manor Motorsport is a team that operates(operated) in numerous different categories before F1 and was set up by John Booth (the current team principal of Manor-Marussia). From 2004 they competed in F3 Euroseries and 2010-2014 in the GP3 series. The current 'owner' is a consortium who I don't believe have any rights to the name. As far as I can ascertain, it's Lowdon and Booth who both own the rights to the name but aren't really 'owners' in the Eddie Jordan sense, not since the consortium bought the team anyway. So in short, I think they'd retain the Manor name unless a title sponsor came along and even then they might pull a Vodafone McLaren or Martini Williams kind of deal or the new owner had his/her own company they wanted to title sponsor the team, like Marussia."
formula1,3dy3rr,mastican42,4,Mon Jul 20 14:22:39 2015 UTC,"Depending on when entries are confirmed for the season the names are locked in also, so even if Manor was brought tomorrow, they'd still be Manor Marussia for the rest of the season at least."
formula1,3dy3rr,iRosso,2,Mon Jul 20 16:24:45 2015 UTC,"yeah but AFAIR in the current name Manor is considered as a title sponsor (They couldn't chage the name because it was too late or something like that ). So if the name could be Flexbox Manor Marrusia or Flexbox Marrusia for rest of the season. Correct me if I'm wrong . I know the team name couldn't be changed but the title sponsor can be changed , can't it ?"
formula1,3dy3rr,coooku,4,Mon Jul 20 17:16:54 2015 UTC,Yes I believe so. This is a situation similar to which Sauber found themselves in during the 2010 season.

Probably the best single example of this I can think of was the stint Vettel put in at the end of the.. Chinese GP, he pitted in for options and basically ran quali laps for a 5 lap stint, and finished about 2 tenths behind Hamilton after closing a 10 second gap.  His fastest lap (and the fastest lap of the race) was a 1:36.808, his Q1 lap was only 3 tenths faster.  Basically they had a beast of a car that wasn't at all kind to the tires for long stints."

Go for one scheduled after 9 PM, since that's when it actually gets dark. They light up all the important landmarks in the city. It's extremely beautiful. On a related note, the Hungarian Parliament is a stunningly beautiful structure. If you have some time to spare in the evenings, taking a stroll along the river is a good option, especially on the stretch known as the 'Danube Promenade', between the Elizabeth and Chain bridges.  Lastly, for an excellent view of the city and the river, go to the hilltop of the Citadella, or alternatively Fisherman's Bastion. If you enjoy gardens and peace & quiet, you could also go to Margaret Island.   As for the racetrack itself, I've never been, so I'm sorry I can't help you there. I hope you have a great trip! :)"

Also in 2014 if you have a travel pass for the city (presumably you will if you need to get around) you could use the train out to the circuit for free; presumably they might do the same this year.   As for what to do there, one of the things I was quite surprised at (it being my first GP) was how little there was to do at the circuit itself - there were merchandise shops and a grand prix game thing, but apart from that not much. There's plenty of food and drink there and only reasonably over-priced, but we took some stuff with us.  In Budapest, go to one of the outdoor spas - they're awesome, if confusing to an outsider.

Just compare Murray Walker to any of the commentators from the last few years, that man knew how to run a commentary.

I have no opinion one way or the other - mostly because don't know a thing about it. So what's going on there? What are the downsides of, say, a ""jet fighter style canopy"" that he mentions?  The only thing I can imagine is that it would take longer to get out of the car, but it seems like there would be ways to mitigate that.

formula1,3dsmvg,wongie,13,Sun Jul 19 18:54:20 2015 UTC,It's not like he got any of that because of luck though. The whole reason he in McLaren's sights is because of how impressive his early pre-F1 career had been. It's not like daddy bought him a spot or someone retired with no notice and they needed to the fill the spot. He worked hard for years and that paid off when his big F1 break came.

formula1,3dsmvg,BudParc,2,Mon Jul 20 00:57:42 2015 UTC,"I never implied anything to suggest Lewis wasn't talened or he was given his seat through favouritism or seat-buying.  My comment was more that when he comes to breaking records he has had the distinct advantage of being put into a competitive car straight away and in which the team stayed competitive for many years to come.  Senna didn't have the fortune being picked up by McLaren in 84, what do you think he's statistics would be if he were? Schumacher didn't have the fortune of being up by McLaren in 91, what kind of statistics would he have had if he were? Renault didn't pick up Vettel when he started, what kind of statistics would he have if he had started straight away with them? I'm not sure about those bygone years, but apart from Vettel, I don't think there were any Young Driver programme equivalents in Senna and Schumacher's age, so you could say it was a different time. But Magnusson was deemed to be ready and the car he got was a shitbox.  My point was never to say any of them aren't talened but there is some degree of fortune when comes to having a free seat and being picked up by the right team at the right time, hence why I included his ""blessed"" phrase though that's probably caused my point to get lost."
formula1,3dsmvg,joeryland,2,Mon Jul 20 00:54:59 2015 UTC,"Hamilton got the McLaren seat at a perfectly normal age, which of course his results proved as well. He just started F1 a bit later than other stars because he was required to win every series before by Ron Dennis.  At the same age Hamilton entered his first race Vettel was fighting for the WDC in 2009, Alonso was a race winner with Renault, Raikkönen had a McLaren seat himself. Verstappen will be as old as Hamilton was at his debut in... 2020."

formula1,3dsmvg,GibsonLP86,6,Sun Jul 19 12:47:13 2015 UTC,My only gripe with the statistic is that the Mercedes has been so dominant it sort of nullifies any result.

Sure, he's in the most dominant car, but if the car is .2 seconds faster than every one or .5 seconds faster, they're still in the quickest car. Senna had fast cars almost every year he was in F1, yet people don't say of him oh it was just his drive. He was the best driver on the track, he's probably going to be in the best drive as well."

In every era there are those who stand out above the rest.   You're not bursting my bubble at all, I'm not in one."
formula1,3dsmvg,MlCKJAGGER,4,Sun Jul 19 18:43:22 2015 UTC,"You are right to say that it's difficult to compare drivers from different Era but personally I think it's fair to believe that the average driver in 2015 is stronger than the average driver in 1988 for example. That's just evolution. I'm not saying that Lewis and Sebastian are better than Senna and Prost but just that we all learn from our old peers that the way it is. Formula one drivers are also more ""professional"" it's a fact. They are fitter. They studied their peers, they know what made others successful etc. So of course some great champions would probably still beat the drivers of this new generation but I have always the feeling that some people glorify too much drivers from the past and are unable to appreciate the one they have right now. It's somehow normal that drivers of today are better. They cumulate their own experience and the one of the others before them. Tennis players of today are also better than the one in the 60s. it's not just because of the technology (wooden racket vs aluminum, lighter shoes etc) it's evolution, experience from other champions, learning their techniques, perfecting them, being fitter and above all the professionnalisation of the sports."

I went to Le Mans this year (I'm a big WEC fan, as well as F1), so that was especially cool!  At the end we got to take pictures with Jolyon, Natalie and Ted (Nick had to rush off, which was unfortunate). I got this with Ted; he also signed my autograph book (which, among others, has Vettel's autograph in, from a few years ago).  I also asked Ted about doing a reddit AMA, as you do. He said that he was asked at Silverstone (I, of course, knew this already, being a keen redditor and /r/formula1 subscriber), and that he'd like to do it but is scared of being asked questions he doesn't want to answer (about his personal life, for example), to which I said he doesn't have to answer a question if he doesn't want to. He also said he doesn't really do technology, and Sky might not let him do it anyway. But he promised to ask them about it, so that's good.  Also got a picture with Jolyon, here. Didn't get one with Natalie, unfortunately, as I was listening to what Ted had to say.  If you watched the show, you might be able to see me when Ted and Jolyon do the lap of the Hungaroring.

You can't trust drivers to slow down, they cannot afford to do that voluntarily often.  VSC is a great solution, unfortunately implemented too late."
formula1,3dwby8,vprakhov,3,Mon Jul 20 04:11:21 2015 UTC,"Just a thought, but what if the recovery vehicles have side\rear panels for cases like this. Bianchi went under the tractor, that's what killed him. If he had impacted a solid wall he would be OK.  Also if he was driving 2013 car the high nose would impact first absorbing some of the impact. I'm now on my phone but when I get home I will check out the specs of that tractor and 2013 cars. Why do I get a feeling that it was the new safety  regs that made it worse.  Anybody remember newey talking about the low noses and the possibility of going under a car rather than impacting it."
formula1,3dwby8,longdickstyle,2,Mon Jul 20 10:02:59 2015 UTC,"The FIA did consider these after Bianchi's accident, but they were decided against. They would apparently be far too weak to do anything, and also the issue is it's still a solid wall. If you look at the barriers around the track, they slow the car gradually. In a regular car you have a crumple zone to save you, in an F1 car that crumple zone is effectively removed from the car and placed on track instead. Panels would not have saved Bianchi."

formula1,3dwby8,mrjack2,-2,Mon Jul 20 04:05:47 2015 UTC,I watched that race and was convinced they would either send out the safety car or red flag the race after Sutil's aquaplane. Remember the track was in the direct path of a huge typhoon and after a long delay it was started under a safety car and stopped 2 laps later. Conditions were atrocious. Race officials made that decision not the track. However no recovery vehicles should be allowed inside the barriers without either a red flag or a safety car.

He handled his publicity for a while before he got into F1 (He came up with the whole Roland the Rat gimmick). My dad tells me that Roland was such a nice guy, really humble and down to Earth in every respect. He was always kind and friendly to people and was willing to go out of his way to help others. Obviously when he died it was a huge shock.  In fact, my dad has an indirect link to Bianchi as well. My father was doing the publicity for Luiz Razia at the time when he got replaced by Bianchi. Razia knew Bianchi well and they were good friends iirc.  Both drivers were killed before they could show their full potential, it's absolutely terrible."

I watched his car fly up into the wall, I heard as they announced his death live at the track. Simoncelli's was only a week or two after that, and I was still a little shaken up due to having watched that crash in person. I walked out to watch MotoGP with my dad, boom Marco goes down, gets hit, dead.   It was harder watching it happen and them dying there and now, instead of in a hospital months later. Jules' was easier to me, because the accident happened and we didn't see it. Then a day or so later we saw it, and then months later he has passed. I think it spreads out the emotion, instead of hitting all at once."

I wasn't into F1 back then and so wasn't my dad, but his GF's 18 year old son who was also in the car was and he was absolutely gutted, didn't say a single word during the 1 hour drive to our hometown, I remember thinking ""Ok, someone dying is obviously always sad, but he's behaving a bit over the top...""

When she woke up and heard he was gone she didn't talk to anyone for almost 2 weeks, we still have tons of Senna paintings up around the house, and the only time she's been really into F1 since was when Bruno was driving (she still enjoys it and watches every qualifying/race session, but without the passion she had for it before). Still makes me sad seeing how she reacts whenever Ayrton is mentioned.   At this point I'm just rambling, but it says a lot about how much someone can effect you even if you don't ever meet them (she had the chance once on the grid in Monaco in the late 80's, but he was with his race engineer and she says she didn't want to interrupt and get a bad reaction from him, which is fair enough, but that was as close as she ever came.

These were the first (and only so far) championship points his team has ever scored after four years in Formula 1 with a car that has been something like 4 seconds off the pace on average, which in F1 terms means they would usually end up a race 2 or 3 laps down. Huge disadvantage where competitive teams are separated by tenths of seconds or less. Not the drivers fault but more due to lack of resources and how the game is played really.      This was an extraordinary accomplishment for Jules and the team, there wasn't a single person that day that wasn't happy for them. Those two points earned them enough prize money at the end of the season so they could compete in this years F1 Championship. He saved the team with this drive.     Jules was part of the Ferrari academy and many believe he would be driving for Ferrari in 2016. He had a huge talent which undoubtedly would have made him a race winner and possibly fight for championships one day. A fantastic yet humble character that will be dearly missed by many, myself included."

The box and pole position part is meant to indicate that Jules retired while still at the top of his game. Using an aggressive fuel mix with his foot flat to the floor, adjusting his bias so he's ready for whatever lies ahead.  His position when he left was a standout driver in a backmarker team.

formula1,3drdvu,Spark_77,16,Sat Jul 18 19:25:24 2015 UTC,"As far as I understand it if someone dies of anything but natural causes Italian law deems that there must be someone who was responsible, in the case of motor racing this falls to the person responsible for the car - hence Chapman/Head/Newey being charged.  I'm afraid I don't know what happened in Chapman's case but for Head & Newey they were acquitted in 1997, in 1999 the prosecution launched an appeal to the decision, again they were found not guilty. This went on for some time, eventually in 2007 Head was found guilty of manslaughter, this was all based around the now infamous steering column and modifications.  However, because the statue of limitation for manslaughter is 7 years 6 months Head was never arrested.  I assume that any charges against Chapman also ""timed out""."

The spare car had been built for Andretti, and Ronnie was the tallest man in F1 and did not fit comfortably in the car.  They dropped the green flag early when the back rows were still moving into position and since they had a running start there was an accordion effect to the front.  Ronnie ended up going into a guard rail.  Though a fire started, fellow drivers put it out.  But, Ronnie's legs were badly broken and he died the next morning from a fat embolism.  The Italian legal investigators charged Chapman thinking that Ronnie wouldn't have died if the car properly accommodated him. They dropped the charge because doctors said that he would have broken his legs no matter what height he was.  But, this is hardly the saddest part of the whole story.  Super Swede was a hell of a driver, and thank you for reminding me of him."

I know a lot of the footage I've seen is before the big changes to safety in F1, but is any of that the same today? Where drivers are like a family?

formula1,3drdvu,dragonheat,1 point,Sat Jul 18 19:32:01 2015 UTC,"There are an assortment of answers to your questions.  The first, I think is that modern engineering of cars have reduced the likelihood of fire.  Fuel cells changed all of racing.  The reason drivers would help during a fire, besides they didn't want to see a comrade burn up, was that they have fire proof clothing and were often first on scene.  Fire was and probably would still be the main reason drivers come to the rescue.  Other than that, track doctors and safety crews tell drivers in all racing that they are not the medical or safety professionals and should stay out of the way during an incident.  Yes, I am sure that crews have many cross team friendships since they travel to the same places."

formula1,3duhev,jetshockeyfan,7,Sun Jul 19 16:31:06 2015 UTC,"Because the whole emissions and ""green"" thing is codswallop. Engine manufacturers are only interested in appearing green because it helps them sell cars - hence they all advertise hybrids and fuel efficiency and so on. If it helped them sell cars they will do anything. No-one in F1 really gives a toss. The emissions to get all the cars and people to one flyaway race is more than the emissions the cars actually produce during an entire season.  The other reason is logistics - grand prix dates are set in conjunction with the promoter/race organisers not to clash with other events in the area to ensure maximum draw.  Also things such as weather are also taken in to account, for example it would be undesirable to run at Austin after the Canadian race because it could be very warm 90-100 degrees. You don't really want 100,000 people in the crowd suffering from heatstroke, quite apart from giving the drivers problems.  In fact in Austin you'd probably find a big ticket drop, because if its hot people will simply stay at home rather than spend all day in the sun.  During the season quite often the equipment and cars do get flown straight from one race to another. If I recall correctly the cars didn't go back to the factories until after Bahrain this year. When in Europe the trucks in years past used to stay on the road but with fewer European races and the fact they are broken up on the calendar makes this less likely now."

It really makes no difference what 20 cars are doing when there's so much peripheral travel. A green formula 1 is the same track for each event, with only tv viewing possible.

I think that a good concession is spending about two months or so going to all of the ""European season"", which are generally the best tracks and hey, you also get some time to travel  around Europe and meet other places I guess.   Almost every year from July to mid September, just at the start of the second half of the season, you can go to Silverstone, Nürburgring, Hungaroring, Spa, and Monza by only spending money on one plane ticket (assuming you don't already live in Europe) and using the time between each race to travel by bus/train/car.  Regarding ticket prices, they are vastly different depending on the race, accommodations and day of the weekend. A good full weekend seat is around 300-400 euros, but there are  always still decent tickets starting from around 100.  I think that the aforementioned trip, considering travel/food/hotel expenses  is perfectly feasible with around 10.000-15.000 euros, and it's really the best option if you want to get as much f1 as you can without spending exorbitant amounts of money.   So as many have ealready pointed out, yes it's crazy how much money you can spend if you want to go to ALL of the races (just think only about plane tickets), but if you are willing to ""maximize"" the amount of tracks that you can go while ""minimizing"" expenses, you can still get a fantastic vacation without going overboard with expenditures (I know that 10.000 euros is a lot of money but we are talking about a once in a lifetime journey centered around something that you are passionate about)."

Maybe you wont go that low in for example monaco, but there are still affordable hotels in monaco.  You also dont need to fly everywhere. You can go pretty much anywhere in europe/asia by train/bus, and you can even take a boat to australia and the US if youre really strapped for cash.  Also tickets for the races are available for pretty cheap, so thats not going to be a lot of money either.  without doing any research id estimate you could probably do the whole year with $10k budget if you were really stingy. $20k would already afford you flights or better hotel rooms/eating at restaurants"

Then, food. Then, transportation around the city, which isn't usually next to the track itself. Then, the tickets themselves (General admission only? Grandstand?).  Then, lest we forget, life continues back home... so the mortgage/rent is still due, so are your local taxes, so are your student loans, so are your car loan, cell phone, etc.  Upon further reflection, 100K is a low-ball figure.

Though our paths may never cross, I consider you my friend, just as I consider all of the people here friends.  And with that in mind, please feel free to PM me if you ever need to.  This will be a hard time for all of us, and no matter what happens or where you are, I hope you know you will never truly be alone in what you go through."

formula1,3dp724,Aniro,0,Sat Jul 18 06:50:23 2015 UTC,"/r/formula1 is part of my daily ritual for me on the internet. It's also easily one of the best subreddits out there because of the community. When we look beyond just the fandom of a team or a driver, we all can do some pretty amazing things, and just the humility of the fans and some of you guys are why I can keep up to date with F1.  Watching these magnificent men and women with these magnificent machines traversing all reaches of the world is nothing short of extraordinary. It may sound cliche, but without us, there essentially is no F1...there never would have been anyone like Jules to cheer for and to root for when he crossed the line at Monaco last year, or throughout his fleeting life as he tamed that red and white beast of a Marussia. Bringing the underdog team to the top in a race merely for survival.  It's as what /u/Id1ot3qu3 said, we all come here because we're comfortable to be honest about the world of Formula One, about Jules, about Manor and the others. We're all standing here as friends and it's a dark time, but you aren't alone. He's here for us and so am I. For anyone. For each other."

There are lots of us for whom F1 is something that drives us forwards, something private that is not shared with friends or family, something that is perpetually on our minds.  I had a friend who was in a heavily brain-damaged state for 4 years following an automobile accident.  He passed away, finally, around five weeks ago.  It was an immense burden on his family, and while I was away from home when he finally died, a mutual friend who spoke to his mother after his death described her as ""sad, but relieved.""    The fact of the matter is that there are people on this sub who will endure their sadness in this event in a kind of private prison; I experienced this myself as I told my brother what happened, having to recap things that have not been far from my mind for the last 9 or so months.  Thank you for having the courage to share with us here.  We all share a passion for this thing called motorsports, and while our paths may never cross in the real world, I consider you to be a friend, and I am always here to talk if you need it."

I can't imagine what it must feel like to have your son mid way between death and life and as assumingly Jules wasn't aware what was happening it was just punishing his family."
formula1,3dpoza,oh84s,2,Sat Jul 18 06:47:14 2015 UTC,"Agreed. They were stuck in the same nightmare for 9 months. Today will be a really sad day for them, it will take a lot of time for them to recover from this, but they will get to actually live again."
formula1,3dpoza,ferkk,1 point,Sat Jul 18 10:02:45 2015 UTC,"Pretty much what I've been thinking. Personally I feel more like he died a year ago, his body was just being kept going and has stopped running. That is an outsider perspective, on the inside, you can't grieve when you see your sons heart beating and body living. It's a time of limbo, you can physically see his body not dead so you can't grieve, but with no signs of hope at all you have no hope. Family were waiting an unknown amount of time for anything really, his body to die or for some sign he might wake up.   Today I would say is a sad day but the beginning of their recovery. You can't get better after someones death until you grieve, and for the family they can't really start to grieve till now. However sad they are they will also feel a great deal of relief that a horrific stage of their lives is over. The biggest thing for them will be dealing with that I imagine. Feeling relief of your son finally dieing would be natural but hard to mentally accept as being normal."

All these years we were doing great with driver safety and although we all knew that at one point or the other something like this will happen to break the safety record of last 20 years (formula 1 is still a really dangerous sport), it still hurts to know it was Marussia who was hit by it twice. They lost a driver during race and another one in testing. We can at least draw some solace that the deaths weren't instantaneous and we at least got a chance to save them. I hope they don't get pulled down by the enormity of this catastrophic happening and disappear into the history books being only known as the team which had 2 deaths in a short span of time.

I'm one of the younger fans here, 25 years old and have watched religiously for the last three years. This is a difficult thing, especially for those of us fans who follow F1 and this sub and don't have an immediate friend or loved one who understands what this is.  I found myself having to explain to my brother tonight, in more detail that I wished, what exactly had happened and why I was crying.  I know that F1, and motorsports in general, are something that some of us come to and never leave.    There is something inside all of us here that brings us back to the sport.  I remember vividly when Dale Earnhardt died, I was only 11 at the time, but I remember my father telling me what happened and me crying.  I was just a boy then, and to an extent I still feel like a boy, but to hear the perspective of someone who has endured this kind of feeling before is a reminder that despite how this feels now, life, and racing, goes on.  We should all seek to honor Jules and all others who have passed in racing by living our lives with the kind of strength and courage it takes to drive any kind of racecar.

It was inconceivable that a such a titan could fall. He also remembers Jochen Rindt, Roger Williamson, and Ronnie Peterson, and all those between them and Senna. He was even at the race when Tom Pryce was killed. My dad was raised with a fatal version of Formula 1. Thankfully, I was not.

I was with two other friends who don't watch Formula 1, and as expected they didn't quite understand what I was feeling in that moment- and to be honest neither did I.   All I know is that it hurts, it hurts a hell of a lot, and right now I don't really know how to explain why, but it does.

formula1,3dpkri,123man60,2,Sat Jul 18 22:53:35 2015 UTC,"It's a strange emotion when you feel sadness over somebody you've never met but when somebody with so much potential loses their life doing something they love which you respect and follow it brings a different level of sadness. We mourn as respecting admirers. When Dan Wheldon died I cried. He was the first on-track death I experienced live. A few years ago I had to do a presentation on ""anything"" for my engineering course as part of the business module . I chose to talk about the safety of Motorsport. I tried to hold it but I visibly broke in my presentation when I got onto Dan. It's a powerful effect: the mind's impact on somebody you respect and admire when they pass, especially in un natural circumstances.    When I read the news of Jules in the morning, I felt glum for the whole time I got ready for work but slso while I was at work. The only comfort his family have are that he died doing what he loved and that a non-instant passing. His famiy  had the oppotunity to surround him while he was still alive although unconscious.  Its very sad that he died but to some comfort, he was alive in the presence of his family. They say coma patients can hear their surroundings and that delivers some 2nd hand comfort to me knowing his family could have had some uplifting impact to him.  My own emotions are of expectations of his death but with denial in acceptance of his young death. His accident was much harder than Schumacher's so I had less optimism for his recovery but it's upsetting to witness the news of his death. I downloaded the video of his crash while it was still on YouTube but I cannot watch it.  I feel sad. I won't stop loving the sport but I react to crashes so much more now R.I.P Jules."

I'm feeling very strange right now. I don't feel like this has had the affect on me that it should have done. I feel like I should be crying, and massively upset but i'm not. Maybe its's because I'm young and taking this in a matter of fact way. I'm in many ways glad it has ended. This was the best outcome. For Jules it was guaranteed he would never drive again. It was almost guaranteed he would have had some severe disabilities, bound to a wheel chair or paralysed. That isn't what Jules wanted. I'm sad but also relieved."

All so that the media and cameras couldn't get shots of the internals of the tire.
formula1,3dnbig,Neipsy,2,Fri Jul 17 20:32:51 2015 UTC,"It was covered so that there would not be pictures of a failed tyre, not because they wanted to hide the internals.  Pirelli as a brand cannot afford to be seen producing products that fail, and it is highly likely that the picture of the failed pirelli would have been used in newspaper articles etc.  They race in a one-make tyre series. Who cares if Bridgestone or anyone else knows a bit about their tyres? It's not like they will work out how to do them cheaper and undercut them - Pirelli already makes a loss on the tyres. Its purely an advertising exercise and as such, it is bad practice to allow one of your failed products to be photographed."
formula1,3dnbig,KittehGod,2,Sat Jul 18 15:34:22 2015 UTC,Thats a bullshit excuse. All Bridgestone need to do is find an engineer and offer him 50% more than he earns at Pirelli.  It's to keep the tyres from the mass market and potentially from being misused. Additionally its an easy way to keeps team from testing privately...
formula1,3dnbig,KittehGod,1 point,Sat Jul 18 15:31:41 2015 UTC,Why would Bridgestone care about a Pirelli tyre :')
formula1,3dnbig,JoeBlerry,2,Sat Jul 18 04:25:59 2015 UTC,Not only is there the obvious concerns about a rival getting their hands on the tyres but if teams could keep the tyres they wouldn't waste them on a display car.  They would test them extensively and examine the tyre compound and construction to better understand their wear pattern and how to maximise tyre life and performance.
formula1,3dnbig,Korvacs,1 point,Sat Jul 18 09:19:07 2015 UTC,Well at least they could work on making fake tyres that actually look like real ones. Even my shoes aren't that shiny after I polish them.

They also know whatever the situation was between Alonso and Massa, so I'm fairly certain that for them, Bottas is a rather known quantity. Unlike Hulkenberg or Ricciardo, for whom they don't have a direct reference point. Ric and Vet driving together for one year is not enough yet.  Bottas has also proven he's consistent in all aspects of being an F1 driver: qualifying, race, strategy, PR, playing the team game, working with the team etc.  In reality, they need someone who can push Vettel but not too much. Someone who on a good day can even outdrive him but in general, someone who can be there right behind him picking up points and securing his back.  There's nobody better suited for that than Bottas."

I really enjoyed cheering him on in 2013. And with Maldonado, I know he's done a lot to get the reputation he has, but as you've said it's been a lot of bad luck this year. The car isn't that great, and both of them have suffered from that, but Maldonado, instead of being the one to initiate the crashes, has been a bit of a disaster magnet this year. I'd like it if Spain 2012 wasn't a one-off for his career, or at least he could do as Grosjean did in 2013 and be a podium regular. I'd also still line to see Grosjean on the top step of the podium as well. I hoped Lotus would be fighting amongst the likes of Ferrari and Williams after switching to Mercedes power units."
formula1,3dmwmu,Avellin,5,Fri Jul 17 16:25:21 2015 UTC,I could see Lotus vs Williams but the amount of chassis and engine integration required gives works teams a large lead.

formula1,3dmwmu,Lord_Iggy,3,Sat Jul 18 03:36:03 2015 UTC,"Of the 9 GP's we have run this year he has retired from 6. In the interest of fairness lets have a look at his season so far.  In Australia he crashed on the first corner. Not his fault, i seem to remember a the two Ferrari's banged wheels, it slowed Kimmi down and Nasr tried to go around him but they then banged wheels which knocked Nasr into Pastor who was passing with a decent amount of space and almost made it out of the carnage. Unlucky again.  Malaysia he did well, retiring on lap 46 with brake issues.  In China it was a similar story, retiring on lap 49 with brake issues.  In Bahrain he finished in 15th. But he lined up in the wrong grid spot (17th instead of 16th) and had a penalty for it (oh how i laughed).  In Spain he retired on lap 45 with ""collision damage"" however he acquired that collision damage in the opening laps as he turned in on his team mate, so arguably his fault but i would err on the side of racing incident. You can review the incident yourself here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=couH7_Rcvo4  Monaco he retired on lap 5 with brake issues but still managed a collision with Massa in that time. No idea on who was at fault i dont remember seeing a replay and cant find one.  Canada, 7th and well earned.  Austria is another 7th. And a huge huge moment pulling out of Verstappens slipstream which he managed to save (showing he has some driver skill or it was a very rare case of luck, which it seems is never on his side).  And Britain, retired first lap in a incident which was not his fault (i have not seen any conclusive evidence but i dont think it had anything to do with Pastor).  Another point of interest is that the team seems to blame the brakes for retirements a lot. I am not sure if this is the true reason or if this is just the simple explanation they give. I would love for someone to provide more information on the retirements because i have my doubts about them being all related to the brakes. He has earned his reputation but i must say he has made improvements. I did go back to look over his season so far in a hope to show he was still the same old Pastor but i am happy to say i am wrong. Will he ever be a world champion? I highly doubt it. But i dont think he still deserves his bad rep (however i have been wrong before and we still have the rest of the year to run)."
formula1,3dmwmu,This_Explains_A_Lot,3,Sat Jul 18 03:20:47 2015 UTC,"It's possible that it's actually a brake issue. With the brake-by-wire and all the energy harvesting going on, there's a lot to go wrong. And if either of those systems fail or develop issues, then there's only so much you can do. The energy harvesting actually helps to slow the car under braking and the brake-by-wire is a big change from the past systems and still has teams working out some kinks here or there it seems. With the brake-by-wire, the brake balance is now set using the wheel instead of the manual lever that used to be on the inside wall of the cockpit and was to blame for a lot of lockups and complaints early on last year. While they seem to have gotten the major issues worked out, little bugs here and there can show up and cause issues with the brake balance and with the pressure applied at x point of pedal travel. When these systems act up or fail, it can cause the driver to have be more careful with their brake application, cause them to have to run too much front bias, etc. This can lead to overheated brakes, flatspotted tires, a car that just can't stop quickly enough, and so on. Mercedes brake issue at Canada helped give Ricciardo the win, and if memory serves me, was somehow related to Hamilton's crash at Hockenheim."
formula1,3dmwmu,Avellin,3,Sat Jul 18 03:45:32 2015 UTC,"Ah yes. I forget that ""brakes"" does not mean what it used to mean, or what it means to most of the world in terms of road cars.

That is: as a percentage of the wet races the driver in question contested.    EDIT: The info we want: https://f1metrics.wordpress.com/2014/06/04/who-was-the-best-wet-weather-driver/    Thanks to u/empw for the link
formula1,3dnk5b,SellMeSomeSleep,22,Fri Jul 17 18:56:24 2015 UTC,I think the most interesting metric would be percentage of wet races won/podiumed/whatever relative to the percentage of dry races won/podiumed/whatever. That should show what drivers overperformed in the wet relative to their dry standards.
formula1,3dnk5b,GoCubs10,5,Fri Jul 17 19:28:27 2015 UTC,Nice there you go. /thread.   Senna was the best wet driver while Button was the most improved going from wet to dry.

formula1,3dnk5b,gutom,-6,Fri Jul 17 19:05:54 2015 UTC,Thats the same guy that has this as his top 10 list of GREATEST DRIVERS EVER. His methods and calculations are biased innacurate and cherry picks wich stats he uses and wich ones he doesnt apply. He's yet to fix this idiotic list.   1 Clark  2 Stewart  3 Alonso  4 Schumacher  5 Fangio  6 James Hunt  7 Nico Rosberg  8 Vettel  9 Ascari  10 Lauda  11 Rindt  12 Hamilton  14 Kimi Raikonnen (FFS)  16 Alain Prost  19 Ayrton Senna  And in 19th place everyone Ayrton Senna 19th....I rest my case.   So according to /u/whatthefat Jenson Button is just a hair away from Ayrton Senne because he put him right behind him in 20th. Jus saying. Take this list with a dumpload of salt.
formula1,3dnk5b,NikiLouder,7,Sat Jul 18 00:16:28 2015 UTC,"I remember him admitting that Nico Rosberg's position should be taken with a grain of salt because he's obviously faced Schumacher when he was past his prime, and so the results are not that representative. He also said that he's revising his current model to make it more accurate in the future.  And that article was from 2 years ago, and this isn't made in just a few seconds, so you can't expect him to update this every race.  One last thing, just because Senna is the most loved by everyone doesn't mean he's the best driver ever."

One last thing, just because Senna is the most loved by everyone doesn't mean he's the best driver ever.   So Kimi Raikonnen is better than Senna and Prost? Rosberg was considered better than all of them 2 years ago? James Hunt as 6th best driver ever? C'mon bro you and i both know that list is massivly flawed. His model isn't very accurate nor is it representative of any other list that has ever been made. Do remember that he is an unknown/nameless guy with a blog. WHo is he anyway? Is he active in Formula 1? Has he ever been? I appreciate the work he put in but i cant for the love of f1 except this as truth or absolute."
formula1,3dnk5b,NikiLouder,3,Sat Jul 18 09:23:16 2015 UTC,It's impossible to compare drivers from different eras against each other. The calculations take into account the competitiveness of the grid when they raced. That's why Senna and Prost aren't higher up.
formula1,3dnk5b,Xlariton,-1,Sat Jul 18 09:42:15 2015 UTC,"It's impossible to compare drivers from different eras against each other.   Thats why we have guys like Nigel Roebuck, Martin Brundle, Murray Walker who would all laugh in the face off this list. No?"

The results they were able to get are very impressive and they were the best drivers of their time but the talent in F1 wasn't as high as it is now thus making it ""easier"".   I don't think anyone should just look at this list and think of it as the truth but it's still interesting and should be noted when arguing about driver skill."

Im not claiming it as the truth or saying it's perfect, I know it's flawed because it's based on pure statistics and statistics don't show the whole story. I agree that Rosberg and Hunt shouldn't be that high and that Hamilton should be higher up, but these are simply what the pre-2014 statistics say. It doesn't reflect his opinions in any way and so it isn't biased, which was your original point."
formula1,3dnk5b,ArianaAnzu,-2,Sat Jul 18 09:33:27 2015 UTC,He is in fact very active and he is   Thats new? What position?
formula1,3dnk5b,NikiLouder,2,Sat Jul 18 09:40:19 2015 UTC,"You have to remember that the stats are up to the 2013 season. So not a surprise Kimi is high up after the Lotus years and before 2014. And also Rosberg is highly rated for beating Schumacher but if only Schumacher's results before his comeback are concerned, Rosberg would be 15th which seems reasonable.  There are obviously some stuff that could be done better in his calculations but I don't think they are too bad or wrong."
formula1,3dnk5b,Xlariton,0,Sat Jul 18 00:51:09 2015 UTC,"I did consider all that and still, not under any circumstance should Rosberg, Raikonnen and Hunt be higher rated than Ayrton Senna and Alain Prost. My issue is not only with Rosberg and Raikonnen but dozens off others who are way out of place. Even with a mathematical algorithm its impossible to consider all variables and seeing the result of the list just makes me scratch my head. I cant be the only one who would dare think for himself instead of going by a list that goes against everything F1 fans/past driver/commentators consider to be the best drivers."
formula1,3dnk5b,NikiLouder,16,Sat Jul 18 09:28:13 2015 UTC,Michael was in a Ferrari. Therefore his results are irrelavant. Senna is our God. If you say something bad about him you should kill yourself. /s

Estoril 85, Donington 93 and Monaco 84 even if he didn't win this one. That's something I was thinking about while watching old races. In dry conditions, expect maybe Suzuka 88, they aren't a lot of unforgettable race from Senna, most of the time it's a ""normal"" race and a ""normal"" win, I don't know how to explain.  I mean, if you ask someone ""what was the best senna's race ?"", maybe 95% of the answer will be a wet race."

Schumacher, Senna and the likes of Hamilton clearly are and that's this ability that has them won those races in wet condition most of the time. Jenson is different. What Button has always excelled at in my opinion was the changing condition. Knowing when to change his tyres at the perfect time to maximize his efficiency.  I think that's why he has won so many wet races. And it's amazing in its own right.  Talent always emerges in the rain and Jenson biggest talent is not driving in the rain but driving ""through"" the rain. Between the drops..."

formula1,3dlvk1,oh84s,60,Fri Jul 17 09:21:37 2015 UTC,"Hulk's not fast over three sectors? He's beaten Gutierrez and Perez strongly at qualifying and had a slight edge over Di Resta as well. So, apart from his rookie season, he's been on form in qualifying. He also got a pole position in a Williams in 10, which was way faster than his car was expected to have gone.  If he's referring to races, then how much of it is down to a slower, less developed, less aerodynamic car compared to Williams and Red Bull is another factor to take into mind.  And the amount of off days Hulkenberg has had after his rookie season, can be counted on one hand. Yeah, no. I'll need to see this data for myself before agreeing."
formula1,3dlvk1,seattt,25,Fri Jul 17 10:32:23 2015 UTC,"Hulkenberg is undoubtedly quick in qualifying, but much less so in races. That has been particularly evident against Perez, with whom he has been practically tied in race results."

formula1,3dlvk1,Gyro88,9,Fri Jul 17 15:31:57 2015 UTC,"He means the race result not the actual points gain. Before Hulk's recent streak of good races after le mans Perez was beating Hulk even without taking the china DNF into account. Difference is when Hulk finishes in front of Perez it usually is in races were the Force India is more competitive (Canada, Austria) and he is able to get more points and when Perez finishes in front its usually for 2 or 3 points.   Hulk has a gift in qualifying pace, can't really say he is outstanding in the race though, he's good in races but not mindblowing and I think that's one of his biggest cons. Bahrain 14' he had a clear shot at a podium and lost it out in a battle with Perez, Brazil 12' he had a chance at a great result and lost it into turn 1 and hit hamilton. I have total belief he can be a great driver to maintain consistent points gain but not so sure a world champion with a teamate such as vettel or alonso."
formula1,3dlvk1,mgo9,4,Fri Jul 17 17:06:02 2015 UTC,"Bahrain 2014 was unfortunate for him because of the safety car, but he did hold up Ricciardo for long enough to secure his teammate a podium, which is likely appreciated by the team bosses."

Perez is also not really known for being quick in qualifying, so beating those 2 doesn't tell that much. Hulkenberg does have some great qualifying sessions though (like that insane pole-position in Brazil).  Also I don't really recall Hulkenberg showing some ""aggression"" in his races, he seems to be more of a defensive driver. Maybe Ferrari is looking for someone who is a bit more of an attacking driver and they think Bottas is a bit stronger in that area?"

formula1,3dlvk1,skd444,6,Fri Jul 17 13:24:20 2015 UTC,"Its not the grid thats weak (go look at the names during the schumacher ferrari years), its that the cars arent so close and some of the best drivers are in underperforming cars."
formula1,3dlvk1,Finelinewine,2,Fri Jul 17 13:32:05 2015 UTC,"Definitely Mehri isn't on the same level as those guys (world champions coincidentally) but that doesn't mean that he isn't a great driver and that the difference with the rest of the drivers on the grid would be relatively small. It would be interesting to see where a guy like Mehri would turn up in a middle of the pack car.   In silverstone he had a great race once it started raining (where the difference in the car is less obvious and the talent of the driver comes into play more), gaining a loot of advantage compared to Stevens for instance.   I do believe that there is a small but very defined leap from Alo, ham, maybe Vet (even tho id put him on the borderline between 1/2 tier drivers) from the rest of the pack. You can just see who has moments of magic consistently (which defines the greats), or those who have some magic (most, if not all F1 drivers should possess this quality if they made it there in the first place) but can't get it down or make more mistakes.   This is just my humble opinion.."
formula1,3dlvk1,dramacraft,2,Fri Jul 17 13:58:24 2015 UTC,"You're the one basing it on one year result by saying because Ricciardo beat Vettel. Ricciardo had some great showing last year but the year before that too. Getting that Toro Rosso into Q3 numerous times.  It's easy to just think people like Ricciardo for beating Vettel but look at it the other way, Ricciardo blended perfectly into the team. He performed amazingly in his first year at the big Red Bull, he managed to put the car on the podium and ahead of the Williams when they had the better car. Ricciardo getting third place in championship last year in an car that had so many problems in pre-season and during season is a show of his skill and talent, of course there was luck but there was also a good driver who was always there and kept his cool.  Bottas, just has never convinced me. I think he had a good season last year but it could have been a lot better, they had the car to be ahead of Red Bull for a big part of season and they failed. He was starting to get beaten by his team-mate and currently is struggling to dominant him as well.   So for me Ricciardo has cemented his position at the upper leagues of F1 already while Bottas is still unconvincing for me. That's why I think it is a stretch to even say they're remotely similar or on the same level."

formula1,3dlvk1,HamiltonIsGreat,32,Fri Jul 17 09:44:26 2015 UTC,"Yes he probably is this year.  Last year was a stand out year for Ricciardo but it was built upon a car and set of tyres that he just seemed to gel with perfectly.  Move outside that window and we've seen him struggle to match the same highs.  Bar probably Hamilton and Alonso this is true for every driver on the grid - they're all amazing and perform at an exceptional level, even Maldonado is capable of dominating when given a set of circumstances where he's both comfortable and has a machine that perfectly matches his style.    I single Hamilton and Alonso out as the two that buck this trend as they are probably the most adaptable drivers on the grid.  That's not to say they're always getting 100% out of the car, but when the setup isn't to their liking they'll still get 99% out of it instead of 98% like the other drivers.  As we're always talking about fine margins in F1 both can be beaten by most of the other drivers when those drivers are in their element and Alonso / Hamilton aren't, but the reverse is more often the case.  All drivers have their occasional moments where they shine, where the track conditions and machinery just gel with them that little bit more than their peers.  The best drivers and best teams make that come around more often than their peers, and the greatest drivers are those that still perform even when things are little bit off.   Edit:  This is also why Vettel had his fall from grace last year, where he was taken outside his comfort zone, but also why he has bounced back so successfully this year.  The new environment and new chance to balance everything to his liking, coupled by a renewed motivation to find that final tenth."
formula1,3dlvk1,HamiltonIsGreat,-6,Fri Jul 17 11:11:35 2015 UTC,"While I agree generally, I'm not so sure I'd mention Hamilton and Alonso together. Hamilton has shown some inconsistency in his career, Alonso relatively even less."

It's tough to see given how bad the car is at the moment but I'd also say Button was out performing Alonso at the moment as well.  Rosberg in qualifying last year is a poor example IMHO as for me it was clear Rosberg was chasing the perfect setup in qualifying whereas Hamilton was setting the car up for a wider operating window in the race and then trying to get as much out of it in qualifying as he could.  This is partly why Hamilton was so much quicker in many of the races with better tyre wear.  2013 in the Mercedes was also an interesting case where the tyres weren't being handled properly by the chassis.  Hamilton still had a clear upper hand over Rosberg beating him in all stats except wins."

formula1,3dlvk1,a_lost_irishman,1 point,Fri Jul 17 12:24:51 2015 UTC,A lot of it is probably down to his weight.
formula1,3dlvk1,LUS001,1 point,Fri Jul 17 12:53:45 2015 UTC,"That can't have helped, but doesn't really explain to me why Hulkenberg is fine in qualifying. He's also not the only driver facing such a problem."
formula1,3dlvk1,dl064,6,Fri Jul 17 17:59:15 2015 UTC,Didn't he essentially race Bottas in Austria? When you compare the two cars that was mighty impressive stuff. He has a real habit of putting a car where it has no right to be. That's how i judge most drivers and Hulkenberg has surprised me more than most.
formula1,3dlvk1,attanasio666,5,Fri Jul 17 21:17:22 2015 UTC,"I like Hulk but your statement should really be ""He has a habit of occasionally putting a car where it has no right to be"".    He tends to have a couple of stand out races in any given season coupled to a couple of poor races and a whole heap of middle of the road races.  At his best, and in the right car, he could certainly win races.  But could he pull together a championship season against a Hamilton, Alonso, or even Vettel?  Probably not.  Could he consistently beat a Rosberg or Button?  Again I think he would have his moments of brilliance but would probably end up behind them over a full season."
formula1,3dlvk1,dl064,2,Fri Jul 17 10:35:37 2015 UTC,"Well, that's kind of what i meant. Wouldn't you attribute those inconsistencies to the teams he has driven for? Also comparing him to Hamilton/Alonso/Vettel is a little unfair as no one is saying he is on that level yet. He would need at least a season in a top car to have a chance of achieving that level of driving. I would like to see him get that chance in a Ferrari or Williams, otherwise we will always be asking the question without ever knowing the answer."

formula1,3dlvk1,theantijokef1,4,Sat Jul 18 16:16:06 2015 UTC,"He's probably not on the level of Alonso/Hamilton/Vettel either. But Bottas and Ricciardo need to be bought out of a contract. Hulkenberg is probably relatively cheap and probably a perfect support for Vettel. You don't need someone who is going to set the world alight when you have Vettel, you need someone who can perform at the level of the car i.e. finish 4th or 6th depending on the Williams performance at any given circuit."

formula1,3dlvk1,jopasny,7,Fri Jul 17 09:41:31 2015 UTC,I though they sacked Perez because he was acting like a dick towards the team. He lacked maturity.

formula1,3dlvk1,dpfagent,8,Fri Jul 17 10:20:03 2015 UTC,They can both be true. They wanted to get Magnussen into a midfield team (no sniggering at the back) but no one would take him. Perez wasn't performing as well as they hoped. So they ditched Perez and took on Magnussen.

formula1,3dlvk1,Comradio,1 point,Fri Jul 17 11:32:42 2015 UTC,would be nice to have that 1 sentence about Hulk substantiated a bit. Fairly vague to just say his track performance data has moments of magic. A little more on how this is qualified and where Bottas and Ricciardo outshine him? I'm assuming a lot of this analysis is done in comparison to the teammate in equal machinery.
formula1,3dlvk1,Lord_Iggy,1 point,Fri Jul 17 10:17:52 2015 UTC,"Hulk doesn't have the fire in his belly. He's been beaten down my mediocre teams, always passed over. Finally this year, with an upgraded car, he rocketed to P5 in Silverstone, until a lack of reaction by FI to a tyre undercut from Ferrari. Even in P5 though, he was unable to pull away with that car. But, his ability to hold that position on track was noteworthy. Had FI led the tyre calls, and had it not rained, it would have been interesting if he could have continued to hold Ferrari back."

I'm not going to call bullshit on the data and analysis, but I feel like cross-team analysis is implausible and at the nitty-gritty probably works on basic assumptions of opposition pace, which itself cannot be done because the baseline is the driver who is himself a variable. I just can't see how anyone can look at base statistical analysis and make any definitive statements with too many variables, variables which really cannot be measured unless you put each driver into a simulator in equal conditions. And even then there's the setup variable."
formula1,3dlvk1,Lord_Iggy,1 point,Sat Jul 18 00:56:25 2015 UTC,"I think the analysis of a driver is more advanced than people realize. If the engineers were able to tell drivers where they were losing time and how to improve their lap (before the rules change) then they can easily make software that creates a driver score metric based on telemetry. Moreover, if the Hulk was better than these guys he'd have a car by now."
formula1,3dlvk1,Comradio,1 point,Sat Jul 18 02:25:40 2015 UTC,"Exactly. Its amazing people think they know better sitting on the sidelines. the teams would have complex software that simulates driver times and compares it to optimal time for the car, projects tyre degradation against car benchmarks, looks at lap consistency etc.   Of course its impossible to know for sure from outside the team, but I think most people would be shocked if they realized how advanced the analysis tools of the teams are."

Vettel is #1. In a choice between hulkenberg and anyone else to pair with Vettel I'd feel comfortable choosing:  Bottas(reliable points and fast enough to keep Vettel Honest) Button(reliable points, good team player, not long term) Ricciardo(Extremely fast and reliable, however could create conflict so lower on the list as he's a competitor for #1 as opposed to a supporter) Verstappen(Young, fast and aggressive, room for growth)  Then Hulkenberg  Essentially in that order."

Ricciardo is probably the best option among them, although Red Bull really want to keep him, which may keep him out of the market.

Bottas may be more consistent than Massa, however, Massa has proven that he has faster pace than him. Bottas was also convincingly slower than Maldonado when they were teammates. Lastly, it is impossible to compare drivers from different teams using telemetry, but the people on this sub obviously fail to grasp this simple fact. Ferrari is persuing Bottas because they know he will be a consistent #2 driver. Whereas, there is a slim possibility that Hulk or Ric are capable of beating Vettel in equal machinery."

Because what if the reason Hulk can't always put the three sectors together is the car? Bottas and Ricciardo have cars that are always good, Hulkenberg doesn't. And come on, Bottas often screws his last quali lap, but nah. I think the actual reason here is that FIAT for marketing reason can't have two germans on a Ferrari."
formula1,3dlvk1,PonkyBreaksYourPC,8,Sat Jul 18 00:26:26 2015 UTC,"It's not about the cars being good or bad. It's about driver performance. That's relative to the car. Even in a car that's worse than the Williams you can still put in consistent laptimes. JA's quote suggests Hulkenberg isn't consistent enough, so he peaks for a couple of laps and then drops down quite a bit for a couple of laps. And I'm also quite sure they didn't just analyze his performance in 2015. An F1 team is clever enough to analyze multiple seasons to rule out his inconsistency is because of the car. So really, it doesn't matter whether you put him in a Ferrari, Williams or his current Force India, he still won't be consistent enough for their liking."
formula1,3dlvk1,2years2months,1 point,Fri Jul 17 10:01:27 2015 UTC,"We don't know if the Force India car is capable of being consistent, that's what I'm saying, sorry if I can't express myself any better. What if it's harder to drive and to be consistent with? He could very well do all he can with what he's got, but that wouldn't translate to cold datas. And that expands to the other cars he drove."

Success needs to be better rewarded. It used to be that sponsorship would follow success, but that doesn't seem to be the case any more so FOM needs a fairer distribution of funds with rewards for winning.

At the end of the day you can say all you want about close racing, good drivers, technology, etc... but if the sponsors aren't coming, the reason is always the same: not enough people are watching for sponsorship to be profitable.  If sponsors can't profit, teams have no budget. If teams have no budget, they can't compete. If teams can't compete, people stop watching.

Yes the world cup is global but it's only once every 4 years. There's basically no other yearly sport where you'd naturally attract fans all across the globe.   Think of it this way: while F1 might be globally the 2nd most watched sport... in most of the countries where it is watched, it is not the 1st or 2nd most popular in that country (even England it's behind Soccer and maybe Rugby and Cricket)  it's mostly because it attracts fans from so many countries that it adds up to a lot.  Furthermore, while it retains this 2nd most watched title, it is still hemorrhaging viewers, so there aren't as many as there were, which is something sponsors care about.  The truth of the matter is that the sponsors not being there says it all; it doesn't matter how many viewers you have if they're not the viewers the sponsors want."

I still feel like they're a more effective source of backing than, say, a government-owned energy company, and they do scout based on talent, but I'd love to know what the cost of participation is. Running costs make up more than half of a team's expenses in GP2, which makes sense given the travel costs - particularly when we still had fly-away rounds in Malaysia and Singapore.

formula1,3djhuq,notthestig,1 point,Fri Jul 17 03:51:38 2015 UTC,"Not before he turned around and tried to squeeze another 70k from the buyer.   According to press reports from then, the British driver put the car on sale in his showroom in Dorset and on June 30, he concluded a deal to sell the car to David McKee for a price of £680,000, with McKee paying an advance of £10,000. At the request of Mansell, McKee agreed to let the car remain with him till the official opening of Nigel Mansell Sports Car, Poole, which was scheduled for July 17, 1989. Incidentally, the list price of an F40 at that point of time was about £150 000. So, for Mansell, the price that McKee had offered was a jackpot. But then during the late 1980s the market was a little crazy. Anyway, a few days later, Mansell learnt that McKee was not buying the car for his pleasure, but to sell it immediately after at a profit. Mansell wasn't particularly happy about that, so on July 12th he called McKee to inform him that he was stopping the sale, unless he was paid another £70,000, according to the magazines of the time. McKee furious at seeing his idol not keeping his commitment decided to take matters to court. Mansell, of course had to relent and so on July 19, 1989, McKee got delivery of the car, to immediately sell it to his client, a certain John Collins. McKee profited to the tune of £20,000, which was a pittance in comparison to what the British champion had made... But the story does not end there. Soon thereafter Collins sold the car to Modena Engineering, which put out an ad for sale in the press, where no price was mentioned, but asking for ""substantial offers"". Rumor has it that the next buyer paid to the tune of at least a million pounds to buy this precious automobile."

Overtaking someone around a flowing section like Bottas did in Malaysia this year in the first sector, is normally harder. Long straights to hairpins or slow corners in general are the vest areas like pies said.    Also China and even Russia has at least one really strong overtaking spot. To be honest, the tracks that have the most obvious spots to overtake are generally Tilke tracks. Older tracks have little in the way of these major braking zones with the exception of tracks like Monza, Spa, and Canada, but then again, that may be why they're still around because they combine overtaking with flowing, epic complexes."

formula1,3dmwkh,vfed6234,3,Fri Jul 17 17:54:25 2015 UTC,Abu Dhabi is one of the worst tracks for overtaking due to the severe field spread caused by the chicane-hairin combination and the slow chicane at the end of the first straight. Even with two DRS it's notoriously difficult. The drivers have made similar comments and Jean Todt even said that the layout of the track may have to be changed after the 2009 and 2010 races there.   Ofc the latter never happened as we got DRS and Pirelli tyres.

formula1,3dm7fv,pocono_indy_400,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:36:16 2015 UTC,"The split Quali at Monaco is dictated by the qualifying format. In the F1 Knockout/Shootout Quali, they've got a full hour to sort the grid out; plus, if there is a huge accident happened then the clock can be stopped if necessary - see the lengthy delay to extract Perez in 2011. Q1 is the only time when all the cars are on track, but only for around 15 minutes and the fastest cars only need to do a fast-ish time to proceed. When Q2 and Q3 come, the track gets thinner so that cars have their own space to do a fast lap.  In GP2/3 however, they've got 30 minutes in one session, where everyone tries to speed up and slow down and come in and come out and do a fast lap and whatever. Mind you, this year's GP2 grid has 26 cars, and GP3 has 27. Full grid qualifying on Monaco will turn into the Next Car Game. Furthermore, since GP2/3 are usually the ""feeder series"", usually they are given little time to race to give way to ""main series"" - Formula 1, so split-grid Quali is the most efficient, relatively fair, sacrifice."

It be a shame if Hulkenberg career ends without a podium finish or even an win.   You have an Button flair, until 2009 I wasn't really convinced he would ever be WDC material but he proved us all wrong, I think Hulkenberg, Bottas could do the same in a good car. Massa and Webber almost did the same.

Then to only have a massive steps backwards and almost getting canned from sport. I always liked Button but I also like Hulkenberg for same reasons, they're both very likable, speak well in interviews and seem to enjoy their time in F1.   It's just really disappointing to see a driver who had so much promise before F1 like Hulkenberg to not be able to show that in F1 now, he was getting talked up as the next Schumacher, part of the same management etc. Dominating A1GP at age of 19/20, where there were a few old F1 drivers and other talents."

Alonso has been doing well before 2005, but that was really his breakthrough year, he ended Schumacher's dominance, he was young, fast, confident, cocky. It was hard to see past him at the time.

formula1,3dlq6t,Laymens_Term,7,Fri Jul 17 11:04:49 2015 UTC,"2005 was the year I felt others had begun to finally match or exceed Schumacher. I thought Alonso had taken Schumacher's mantle and if I'm completely honest, at the time I thought Raikkonen was just as good. In retrospect, I think I was mistaken there.  10 years ahead is a very long timeframe -- most top drivers' careers don't even last that long! Of the drivers on the grid in 2005, I probably would have picked Alonso, Raikkonen, Button, and perhaps Montoya as the next generation (although his shine started to disappear at McLaren that year).   I didn't rate Massa at all at the time, and I think he improved a lot under Schumacher's guidance. I also thought Webber and Heidfeld looked like potential race-winners in the right machinery, but it seemed unlikely that they would ever get to a top team.  Of the drivers in the junior series at that time, Hamilton and Rosberg both really impressed me. I also thought Piquet Jr. was destined for great things."
formula1,3dlq6t,whatthefat,7,Fri Jul 17 13:05:48 2015 UTC,"I think Raikkonen was just as good at the time. I think he's just a driver that was at his best with a certain generation of cars. He was an absolute monster at times in the 2000s, but he hasn't been able to cope with the new power units and the brake by wire system. He was better than his results suggested and even Norbert Haug said that poor Mercedes reliability cost him 2 championships."
formula1,3dlq6t,SensationalDuke,0,Fri Jul 17 17:38:25 2015 UTC,"In retrospect, Raikkonen had very quick cars in 2005 and 2007. 2003 was a great performance, but in later years I think he was flattered by the car."
formula1,3dlq6t,whatthefat,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:09:28 2015 UTC,"One thing I do take umbrage with is people suggesting Raikkonen can blame McLaren for losing the 2003 title. He had one mechanical retirement (that unfortunately was when he was in P1), as compared with three occasions where he screwed up qualifying and started at the back.   Of all four drivers in the title hunt in 2007, Raikkonen wasn't necessarily the one I'd have given it to that year. But hey, points mean prizes."

formula1,3dlq6t,git_bazman,3,Fri Jul 17 08:08:03 2015 UTC,"Yes, but Verstappen is 17 and already in F1. At the time, the drivers with the most potential seemed to be Alonso, and (to a lesser extent) Kimi. They were both in their mid-20s, so there would be no guarantee either of them would even be around 10 years later..."
formula1,3dlq6t,mathdhruv,3,Fri Jul 17 08:29:10 2015 UTC,I thought Kimi would be brilliant even 10 years in the future. By 2007 though I was sure that Vettel will be a world champion one day.
formula1,3dlq6t,Mcquiz,3,Fri Jul 17 09:56:56 2015 UTC,"Apart from the obvious Kimi and Alonso, I remember thinking Scott Speed and Nico Rosberg would be the next big things. I think at that point Nico had won the GP2 championship and Scott Speed was the next big American driver."
formula1,3dlq6t,macus16,3,Fri Jul 17 08:36:24 2015 UTC,"I wasn't thinking 10 years ahead and I couldn't say who would be winning because chances are it will be a 90% different field.  Off the top of my head Button, Kimi and Alonso are the only ones left. Button was shit, if you told me he would win a WDC I would have laughed in your face.   It was the year of Alonso's first Championship and he had got a few podiums before that year but at the time he was kind of in the Bottas position. Good enough given the right car but by no means a certainty.  With Kimi you knew that if his car stopped blowing up he had one or two championships in him.  To be honest in 2005 the only future I saw was counting down the years until Schumi retired and someone else having a chance, it's difficult to describe just how unstoppable he seemed. Hamilton is winning but Rosberg is nipping at his heels, Schumacher was in a class of one and when he wasn't the team made sure it wasn't a competition. Obviously Alonso quickly showed his form and won the championship."

You can buy the 3-day and try to sell the first days but they arent worth much (Sunday is most of the cost) and you likely won't sell them at all unless they are in the premium seat areas.  The best seats:   Main Grandstands (premium seats) - See start and pits but have to watch big TV to see the rest of the race. Turn 1 (premium seats) - Can see the entire track from the top, great view of Turn 1 but need binoculars to see the rest of the track. Turn 15 (premium seats) - Fantastic views of Turn 11 - 15.  Close to all the other stuff to to the side entrance. Turn 9 (bleachers) - Good views of Turn 6-12.

Turn 12 gave a great sense of the speed of the cars, but the grandstand is huge so the variance is large from end to end.  Turn 15 gave you a great view, you got to see the cars for probably the longest per lap of any of the seats, but they're also probably traveling the slowest on average through that section to you don't get a great sense of their speed. There is usually some good action with people trying to overtake there though.  Turn 15 is great for all the off track stuff, very convenient for all the vendors, and food, etc."

We stayed in downtown last year, if you can work out AirBNB then you should.  That said I highly recommend trying to be within walking distance of 6th street as Austin is a BLAST.  Last year also fell over halloween so there was a bunch of things to do.  The other cool thing about staying in a hotel downtown is most of the broader team support staff will be staying there as well and you can strike up conversations with them.  What mr_yuk said is pretty much spot on regarding the seats.  Ours were in turn 15 last year and it was an awesome view of the action.  That said, Turn 9 grandstands overlooking the chicane complex of 7 to 10 and back down the hill to 12 is a great viewing point for less money."

formula1,3dlnnb,everyZig,1 point,Fri Jul 17 08:33:43 2015 UTC,"I visited the Ferrari Museum last year. There are now two sites - the Ferrari Museum itself, in Maranello and the Enzo Ferrari Museum in Modena. We were staying in Bologna and caught a local train to Modena, the Enzo Ferrari Museum is about 10 minutes walk from the railway station.  You can buy a combined ticket to both museums at the desk, they provide a shuttle bus between the two sites, IIRC it runs between the sites once an hour. On the return from Maranello the bus first calls at Modena railway station before going back to the Enzo Ferrari Museum.  The Enzo Ferrai Museum is stunning, they built a new visitor centre next to Enzo's father's workshops. There were a selection of historic Ferraris, Lancia, Alfas and Maseratis in the museum when I visited, along with things like a road-going Maserati MC12. In Enzo's father's workshop, there is a display of things like a Ferrari Enzo that was owned by Luca di Montezemolo, a collection of old F1 engines, a 1990 F1 car etc. Also by the entrance there are a load of old F1 photos on the walls, I could have looked at those all day.  The Ferrari museum is as /u/everyZig said - you will need a lot of time in the ""Hall of Champions"" as it gets really busy in there, there are 5 cars Schumacher won championships in on one side and then on the other side behind you are many of the race trophies, plus displays for all the drivers who won a championship for Ferrari - Surtees, Lauda, Scheckter, Schuey etc.  There are gift shops and cafes at both sites, naturally they are bigger at the Maranello site. Great coffee at both.  Oh, and next door to the museum in Maranello is a place called Push Start - they have a shop full of merchandise and scale models, not just Ferrari, and if you have a driving licence be sure to take it with you as you can rent a Ferrari to drive round town for 20 minutes."

Gift shop was way overpriced compared to the next door neighbors. Ducati and Lamborghini are close by (a 30 minute trip by car). Do check to see if the Ducati factory is open because it was closed when i went there. Imola is another 30 minute drive from Ducati. Museum is extremely lacking and overall tourist info is slim.

It's at the very most half an hour away from Milan city centre, and when there's no track activity scheduled for the weekend, the entry to the circuit area costs a few euros. And while you're there, you can check out the rest of the Monza Park, it's beautiful (both the circuit area and the rest of the park) and can be entertaining if you're visiting with someone that's not into racing.  Just make sure there's nothing big scheduled for the weekend that would raise admission fees and cause general chaos (I don't know what's the ""spectator"" admission for track days, for example)."

Had he been declared dead on the day it would have been very different, as with Allan Simonsen at the 2013 Le Mans.   The real sad part happened 9 months ago, really. Him leaving us was the best thing that could happen when looking on what the alternative would be, as we know he would never be back in racing again, let alone have a functioning life. He was severely braindamaged and he wouldnt have wanted to live strongly handicapped. Also, his family can finally find some peace instead of waking up each and every day with ""what if, any news, etc"".   I will remember him as one of the brightest talents at his time, no one can take that from him, but I was prepared for this day so I was not really shocked."

Without it we have no drive as there is no end. The fact we are terminal gives every breath and thought a purpose and beauty that we all cherish. When deaths comes early it is unfair but Jules did what he did as it was his life's purpose that was driven by an end that would inevitably come.   We need death as much as we need air.

Having seen Barrichello's then Ratzenberger's accident we were all a bit down already but we went on to watch the race.  As soon as Senna crashed TV was turned to another channel and there was no F1 for around a year, nearly 2 at our place. We all loved the sport but no one would turn on to watch a race. We'd still buy Autosport weekly and watch Motorsport programmes. Just not live F1 races.  Nowadays when I'm chatting with my mother on the phone she still asks for race results and how's the championship going. She was hyped with Bruno Senna was racing but now she always asks about Hamilton, McLaren and Rosberg (mostly for being Keke's son). She just watches a race whenever me or my brother are visiting or dad peeks the race which isn't often."

However that was the start of Schumachers rise, and thats who i grew up with and learned to love, so his accident hit me hard.  This is the first F1 death that really affected me in any meaningful way. However I cannot imagine what our parents or older fans felt who witnessed double deaths at a race weekend like in '94."
formula1,3dq7lj,27629,2,Sat Jul 18 12:50:16 2015 UTC,"Well, the biggest impact back then was in adults and fans. Mostly people from Portugal and Brazil who had more contact and affinity with Senna. And of course, Senna's death was highly regarded and Ratzenberger's was shadowed in the end.  I still think Max Mosley's decision to attend Ratzenberger's funeral and not Senna's was the best. Everyone was at Senna's. It had state honours. Someone and the FIA didn't forget the young Austrian.  That weekend was terrible but a lot has been learnt from it. If we look back at it, Barrichello, Ratzenberger, Lamy hitting J.J. Lehto with debris flowing into the grandstands. Nowadays the procedures would be totally different.  Unfortunately Bianchi's death  came in the right moment. Now it's time for us to look at it and improve. We have new rules coming soon for 2017 and this accident will have to be in their memory when working on them."

formula1,3dpr1f,xpen25x,1 point,Sat Jul 18 09:59:06 2015 UTC,My point was that outside of racing in a simulator accidents can and will result in serious injury.  As we move forward the FIA will impliment things to help mitigate accidents. The virtual safety car works well for 24 hours of lemans. It has worked well at other wec races and at silverstone it worked well though I think a sc can bring the pack back together and bring more excitment because the restart can result in a change of lead. But the past several years it never really works that way

I'm guessing you're one of the very few who hate the 45 seconds total throughout the entire race that they cut to a pretty girl. It's called the F1 Show. It has racing, F1 cars, pitstops, crew workers, fans cheering, family members of the drivers, race engineers, and very occasionally pretty girls, often times who are related to the drivers themselves. A good TV executive shows all of these things for the sake of the fans watching. Of course the coverage can often be better in many other aspects, but showing pretty women is not extremely detrimental to the race itself. Shit, I know I don't mind it. But anyways."

The feeder series are all Eurocentric or at the very least biased against US open wheel racing. It seems that there isn't one shred of racing talent inside the confines of the United States worthy of an F1 seat according to the likes that post here.

formula1,3dik2i,Thedominateforce,1 point,Fri Jul 17 03:07:22 2015 UTC,Attendance doesn't mean they don't find talent.  What would really open the eyes of F1 teams to US talent (if that's possible) is if IndyCar would get COTA on the calendar.  That would instantly give a point of reference for even comparisons.    Now we know IndyCar isn't a rich series so their abilities are limited in what they can do.
formula1,3dik2i,kukumicin,1 point,Fri Jul 17 05:50:44 2015 UTC,I would love to see other series at COTA but I remember hearing NBCSN saying last year that F1 has a contract with COTA to be the only open wheel series to run there.

Vandoorne is ranked 1st and he's rumored to get a seat with McLaren in 2016 or 2017. It's not beyond the realm of possibility that the guy who finishes second to Vandoorne could end up with a seat on a first year backmarker team in 2016.

Just to put him in perspective before gp2 he was in fR3.5   35 races 2 wins 0 poles  He is a meh driver. Good job to him for getting this far but if he comes into F1 he will be embarrassed

Parker Kligerman went the NASCAR route and it never panned out as he got stuck with bad equipment and luck, but Rossi and him raced in the same series in 2006 when Parker was open wheel racing.

Vergne was briefly hospitalised in 2014 due to being forced into an extreme diet, and he said he was losing about 4 tenths per lap to Kvyat due to his weight disadvantage.   Bigger than teammate and Toro Rosso newcomer Daniil Kvyat, the slight Russian teen, Frenchman Vergne said he committed to losing several pounds over the winter to prepare for F1's much heavier new cars.  ""The weight difference between myself and my teammate was making me lose four-tenths [of a second per lap],"" Vergne, who was given a rare third consecutive season with the Red Bull junior team this year, told French media. ""I did a diet this winter, but you get to certain limits that the body can no longer take.

Bear in mind these aren't normal wets I don't think, they're likely even softer versions designed to run for a few laps, if that, and then turn into chewing gum but provide very good grip for those few laps even on very cold tyres.  They could run on slicks, but pottering up a hillclimb can't really put the energy required into the tyres to keep them safe whereas it can on wet tyres."

Teams are allowed to use cars that are 2+ years old for filming days/giving junior drivers mileage for superlicence requirements/public demonstrations/etc. - if they were allowed to run the normal tyres then the richer teams would probably end up running lots of old cars to use them to test and understand the tyres.

A part time fan has been watching for a short period of time and tell us they will leave the sport if they keep the V6 and don't btring back the 'legendary v8'.  The noises F1 makes are not what makes it amazing.  They are just one thing created FROM the sport of F1.  Making HILARIOUS images with me name in them?  Funny, but sort of making my point for me.

Compared to the wets which work pretty much ""out of the box"" in cold temperatures with very little warmup.  Bear in mind these aren't normal wets I don't think, they're likely even softer versions designed to run for a few laps, if that, and then turn into chewing gum but provide very good grip for those few laps even on very cold tyres.  They could run on slicks, but pottering up a hillclimb can't really put the energy required into the tyres to keep them safe whereas it can on wet tyres."

Then there is Williams where he is is at now. The only team I see with the capabilities (ie driver, team, money, etc.) is Ferrari.  Bottas is in his prime and Vettel is far better IMO.  Yes, Bottas will end up on podiums here and there...but I can't think of a single time where it wasn't due to another team's short coming that day.  IMO bottas and massa are two VERY good #2 drivers that just happen to be driving for the same team.

I get it that Williams doesn't give team orders and allows to race but I think we would've had a way better show on Sunday if they let bottas by Massa in the UK.

The car had all the camo pattern on the back of the car, and we were all standing around admiring it, and talking to the driver who turned out to be the head of dynamics at Jag. He was clearly regretful about being stuck on a train for half an hour with a bunch of car enthusiasts who were probing and prodding his secret car, but he was very relaxed, leaning against the carriage with his colleague.    I made an off-hand comment that ""If you didn't put all this camo crap on the car it'd probably go unnoticed by 99.9% of people, you're drawing attention to the rear of the car.""   ""You're absolutely right."" was the reply.   I stopped, grabbed my buddy, mentioning what was said and we headed off to the front of the car whilst the rest of our group were still at the back.   As soon as we started kneeling down and pointing at the front (just a bit of bluffing) the Jag guy stepped over and practically stood on top of us to see what we were up to, getting visibly agitated.   We didn't see anything of note, other than the massive ceramic brakes and the bigger air-ducts, but it turned out to be the new F-Type SVR."

Either by implementing the vectoring inside the diff, or in less advanced applications by using the wheel brake on the inner wheel (just like traction control/stability control/ABS etc.) to force more torque to the outer wheel, which kind of ""simulates"" a clever diff."
formula1,3djjgd,bacon8,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:45:00 2015 UTC,Well if it torque vectors to the rear during a turn and sends power to the front coming out of a turn then understeer won't be that bad.

formula1,3djjgd,kredep,0,Fri Jul 17 01:11:35 2015 UTC,4wd is about traction in a straight line.  It has nothing to do with limiting understeer.
formula1,3djjgd,332i,-1,Fri Jul 17 12:31:03 2015 UTC,AWD increases cornering speeds. There's a reason the Nissan GT-R and Porsche 991 Turbo S are insanely quick around tracks.
formula1,3djjgd,Porsche_Curves,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:37:41 2015 UTC,"So are a plethora of rwd cars.  Those use awd systems that are not constant at each wheel.  That's not why they haul ass around turns.  When you're not getting wheel spin in the rear, it is physically impossible for the same car at the same weight with awd to be as quick through turns.  You're forcing the wheels to put power down and maintain mechanical grip.  Removing the front wheel drive from an awd system just frees up the front wheels to handle more mechanical grip.  Rather than forcing them to deal with lateral and longitudinal grip, they're just being asked to handle lateral grip.  Basically, you're giving the front tires dual duties with awd and fwd.  If you remove the rwd from awd.  Fwd is obviously slower, so what sense does it make in adding the poor qualities of fwd?  You may as well argue that fwd is faster than rwd around a circuit.  It is the same exact concept at the front axle.  Period.  You're argue against physics.  Please explain why you think awd increases cornering speeds.  I'd really enjoy reading that."
formula1,3djjgd,332i,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:33:42 2015 UTC,"I agree - AWD does not automatically create more grip and make a car have better cornering speeds, especially if you simply add it to a RWD car with perfect balance which doesn't spin its rear wheels.  However, for argument's sake, let's imagine a very powerful RWD car which spins the rear tires often and is prone to oversteer. In this particular case, adding AWD should in theory reduce oversteer, provide better balance and enable the car to corner quicker"
formula1,3djjgd,Stephen-Paul,0,Sat Jul 18 16:55:39 2015 UTC,Because you have far more grip thus enabling you to push more. 991 Turbo S lateral G- 1.05. Standard 911- 1.0. More grip= the faster that you can go. That's why WEC limited at what speeds you could enable electric motors.

formula1,3djjgd,332i,31,Fri Jul 17 19:30:02 2015 UTC,AWD/4WD makes the car heavier and the grip it gives does not make up for the added weight. It has been tried before in the 60s and 70s and none of the cars that had it were particularly successful.

And on FW08's page it says:   The FW08B was a six-wheeled (4 driven wheels at the rear and 2 undriven wheels at the front) variant that originated from the FW07D (also six-wheeled). It never raced. Patrick Head specifically said that the reason it was banned was because ""someone in a FOCA meeting said it would drive up costs and cause chaos during pitstops"".

formula1,3djjgd,Uurloq,3,Thu Jul 16 22:25:29 2015 UTC,"Agreed with most of what's been posted already, but going to throw in some more things (many of it repeats of what's been said already) as well, as this question is quite interesting: Imagine having to shoehorn a driveshaft underneath the cockit = raised seating position, or move the driver off-center. Either option will not have a particularly positive effect on center of gravity and aero I'd imagine. Also consider that a diff of some sort and CV joints will need to somehow be shoved into the nosecone, the same nosecone teams are constantly trying to reduce the size of and raise as much as possible. Then there's the issue as well where a great chunk of the bottom of the nose is not inline with the rest of the car, but considerably higher (thanks Benetton!)... Introducing a driveshaft will mean either some very complex witchery to have a non-straight driveshaft, or more likely that the nose's bottom will need to return to near pre-94' levels again and be much closer to the ground. I wouldn't necessarily complain about that btw.    In addition to the above, there's probably weight distribution, and likely with today's rules, increased fuel consumption to consider. Safety I don't think should be that big of an issue, apart from the increased hard-bits that may penetrate the cockpit in a big crash.    I don't think it would necessarily be an inferior layout to be honest. I just think that the world has progressed so far with the current layout that it's probably become a comfort zone more than anything else. The issues in this very post are based purely on the regulations that evolved along with a mid-engined, RWD layout for a very long time. Had there been AWD F1 cars around for a sufficiently long length of time and the regulations adapted and evolved with it instead of banning it outright, together with some sufficient R&D time to progress it, who knows what might have been.    Another case of F1's regulations perhaps being way too strict and archaic, but that's a rant I'll spare this sub for another day.    TL;DR: I think it would be extremely difficult to work AWD into today's cars and today's regulations. Had the regs been different and the expertise and experience been there, who knows."

formula1,3djjgd,schneeb,4,Fri Jul 17 02:31:04 2015 UTC,"AWD is more expensive but it's also heavier.  In a motorsport where people are desperate to shave off every milligram that they can, dropping in a convoluted AWD system adds a relatively gargantuan amount of weight.  From what I've read, powering four wheels is less fuel efficient than powering two, as well.  Additionally, adding power to the front wheels means more tasks that their finite amount of grip is being tasked with, as with RWD the front wheels brake and steer, but going AWD adds propulsion to that to-do list, as well.  Oh, let's also not forget how tiny these cars are, with drivers effectively wearing them, and the engine and gearbox are behind the driver, from where power will have to pass through the cockpit to the front wheels, but the driver's ass is on the ground already and there's essentially nothing in the nose but the driver's legs, so all this would need rebuilt into something larger of different shape so we can get power up to the front wheels.  Now we have a larger, heavier car."
formula1,3djjgd,IceMan_PJN,3,Thu Jul 16 20:59:50 2015 UTC,Isn't it also because it is more challenging for the drivers to drive a lightweight RWD car with all that power ?

That means two things. One, with a higher minimum weight it is more advantageous to take the weight penalty of powering the front wheels for the increased acceleration it provides. Two, the speed at which AWD stops being beneficial is somewhat higher for LMP cars - a F1 car can apply maximum torque to the rear wheels without breaking traction at a lower speed than a LMP car, because it has more downforce."

Don't LMP1 cars generate considerably more downforce than F1 cars currently? As far as I'm aware the main advantage of the current F1 cars over LMP1 is that they are much lighter.   a F1 car can apply maximum torque to the rear wheels without breaking traction at a lower speed than a LMP car, because it has more downforce.   Admittedly I'm not quite sure how much traction LMP1 cars are getting relative to F1 cars these days, but with the current power units I'm not sure that F1 cars can apply maximum torque at lower speeds than LMP1 cars. Currently, F1 cars are usually at half throttle on corner exits at points where they used to be at 100% throttle in 2013 - drivers often don't reach full throttle until 3rd gear nowadays.

I think everything you said was completely right for the 2013 and earlier cars, but as you say these new PU and aero regulations have drastically changed the characteristics of F1 cars.

Also, when it comes to overtaking, there is such a thing as just too wide. 2 meters isn't it, but 2.5 to 2.8 meters? Sorry, just don't think that's a good idea.

Michael loved going down there and spending the whole day practicing starts and pit stops. His logic was 'If you can make one perfect start, then why not practice it enough so that you can make 16/16 perfect starts?' . When Berger and Alesi joined from Ferrari, they said 'No , no, we don't need to do that, we know how to do starts'. But they weren't consistently making great starts. Once they started doing practice starts, all of a sudden, they were both making consistently good starts.

All they ever found was launch control, which had been deactivated and removed from the menu. As a matter of fact, the Ferrari that year was caught with a traction control system, with a driver even admitting it had been in use in races. The McLaren, similarly, was caught with a program that automated the gearshifts, which was also illegal. I don't see people shitting on them. So why target Schumacher particularly?  Secondly, Schumacher practised those starts. Do you not remember his time at Mercedes, where he was consistently the best starter on the grid? And how do you explain '95, when there was no illegal system found at all?  Thirdly, if Flavio was involved in the driver aid cheating as you imply, why would he put the systems on one driver's car and not on the other? Was the constructor's championship less important to the team? I'd say it was the opposite, since it's the constructor's title that carries the prize money.

He raced GT cars for a while, and wanted something a bit more 'frisky'.  I spoke to him at Gurston Down hillclimb track, and he said he plans on putting a FR3.5 engine (however they went with a Hartley H1V8 in the end) into the back of it, and wants to use it at a hillclimb car. I think it's a bit wide for that, personally, but each to their own. The Hartley engine is a similar size and shape to the 3.0L Honda that used to be in it, and produces around 500bhp rather than ~750bhp, but I imagine that's enough for most people.  I believe it's a pain in the ass to work on. The car is so tight, and built for the exact parts that it used to run with. I think he's done a fair amount of hacking-and-slashing to make everything fit. I think he's essentially cobbled together bits from all sorts of different cars. The steering wheel is from a GP2 car, for example. It's not really got a great deal of F1 car left in it. The new engine won't be a stressed member like the original engine, so it'll sit in a cradle. The gearbox has had an overhaul, so they can last longer (as they'd usually have a lifespan of a couple thousand km, and not much more).  I last heard (in about Jan last year) that he's not really working on it much, as they were waiting to sell another car to fund the project. He was working with some other engineers and companies to do the tricky bits - like hydraulics and electronics. I know that the project was in fairly full swing up until last year - they were wind tunnel testing at MIRA: Here's a video of it. Here's a load of pictures of this test  The tow car is a Dodge viper GTS. They use it to tow the RA107 to events and stuff from their workshop in Bath. I heard he was offered six figures for it, but I think he wants to see the project through rather than selling it.  Edit: Google says that /u/Indestructavincible was an F1 Technical mod, so I guess they'd know a bit about it too. I'm not a member of the website, so I can't check if he's updated the project since. The thread has been dead since last year, so that doesn't bode too well."

formula1,3deg3s,musef1,5,Wed Jul 15 17:57:46 2015 UTC,"Take the setup above as our example.    When he accelerates or goes up an incline, the weight of the trailer will shift backwards, causing the front of the trailer to try to lift up the back of the viper, decreasing drive wheel traction. The higher the centre of mass on the trailer, the worse the problem becomes.    Going down hill or braking does the opposite, causing the trailer to push down on the back of the viper, which also has the effect of lifting the front of the viper, reducing traction on the steering wheels.     Given that the load in this image is probably more than 3000 lbs, and probably more than the towing vehicle, these problems can become quite serious.    The way to mitigate these problems is with a low deck trailer with larger diameter wheels, like this."

It is lowered to the ground in that picture (for loading - you don't tow it like that), and when raised is actually quite high (at least as high as the tandem the Viper is towing) - this video shows it in the raised position: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RflkZn2jP8  While I have no idea what a Viper is like as a tow car, I'd have no problems pulling a ~600kg F1 car on a trailer like that behind my normal tow car. I'd imagine that style of trailer is the only one that an F1 could fit on too - given the maximum width of a trailer (in Australia at least) is 2.5m, by the time you put the bed inside the tyres, there wouldn't be enough width left for the car."

Am I just talking out of my ass? No. I drove a tow truck for about a year. I have experienced the physics of towing first hand.

And even going on into 2016, even if Mercedes is not as dominant as this year, it's very unlikely they won't have the fastest car or at least be neck and neck with someone else. Which again mean that Rosberg would have the highest likelihood of being a non-Hamilton WDC, because there's no way to predict who the mystery team would be that would actually be competitive with Mercedes."

I think you are plenty smart, if you are not, like I was, then you supplement your short comings with hardwork. When I was studying Engineering, most of my grades were A's and B's.   I was also spending 12-14 hours a day studying, or working on assignments, but if you want to good at anything thats what you have to do.   Work at it.   You sound like you might have a confidence problem. Ill tell you this, if you made it into the world championship in robotics (at whatever level), you are already a tonne smarter than probably most of the kids who go into first year.   In anycase, Engineering isnt just about being smart. You need to understand a good deal about Mathematics and Science, yes, but then that would just make you a Scientist.   Engineering is about using Science and Mathematics to achieve some sort of design or operational goal.   Ive been working as an Engineer now for a few years, and I can tell you, the work load ebbs and flows. Some days you might be doing normal 7.5-8 hour days, some days you might be doing 11-12 hour days.   You will get use to the work load.   As far as getting into F1 goes, most people start out in their University Formula Student/FSAE team. Thats basically a sandbox version of F1, where university teams design their own car and compete in time trials.  From there you can look at either grad programs with F1 teams (ideally), or jobs with other motorsport disciplines.   If you want to get an idea of what life working in a racing team is like, wander over to you local track and ask some of the guys if they know people that are looking for volunteer team mechanics.   It wont be the top shit of racing but at least you will get a real idea of what life in that environment is really like (its not all glamour)."

I know a few kids who are in the same mindset as you are. A lot of them are pursuing their mechanical engineering degree and at the same time they're also involved in the Formula SAE team (where university students create mini single-seater cars to race against other universities). As well, they tend to network a lot with auto-manufacturers or any other people in sports/automotive industry to see if they can give some advice on how to go up the career ladder.  It's a long way to go, but very rewarding if you stick to it. Based on the competitiveness and sheer magnitude of sport, a very solid education is how you get the ground running and it's all about building connections and getting exposed to motorsports afterwards (try small, local teams first).  Wish I could have given you a more solid answer, but I'm actually in a finance program haha. Hopefully this sets you on the right foot!

Most of the pressure is from the media. The pundits saw them doing well early in pre-season testing and above expectations at Australia and Malaysia and assume they would be making Merc fight for it in 2015 already.  Now, if internally Arrivabene pivoted from 'let's make a great 2016 car' to 'let's try to catch Mercedes in 2015 when it's already too late,' that's a different story.

This is why Vettel has been left for dead in the opening stints in Canada, Austria and Silverstone.""   These two events outside of Allison's control account for the majority of the gap increase between the two teams, so I struggle to understand how his future with Ferrari should come into doubt. I can't help but think that not renewing his contract could have dire consequences. The absolute worst case scenario for Ferrari, is that they will find that in the the second half of the season that they are consistently battling Williams for second instead of Mercedes for first.

But the win in Malaysia arguably heightened expectations too much in what should be a transitional season for Ferrari. Mercedes can’t dominate for ever and with signs that in-season engine development will get voted through again for 2016 there is every reason to expect that Allison’s team will be able to mount a challenge in 2016 and fight for the title next year, if left alone to do their work.    Yup, the win hyped up the expectations a lot.   Racers would leave them that space. Business men running the operation may see things differently and creating tension before a crucial race can be counterproductive. Time will tell.

I don't know how significant the fuel flow loop Ferrari were abusing was, but its another stupid regulation that places a completely pointless restriction on the teams. Why on earth does fuel flow matter to anyone, total amount of race fuel is a perfectly fine limit on its own.

A mix of being strapped in poorly, no hans device and because she isn't very strong is making her look like a rag doll.  Even driving around in a 125cc karts you can feel there is a bit of  strain on your neck, I've seen girls and even some guys go out with either a friend/family or one of the track staff in the biplace karts and struggle in them so putting them in car with similar power to an F1 car would be rather dangerous."

formula1,3dgnvm,AutoEngineer22,7,Thu Jul 16 08:51:23 2015 UTC,The lack of HANS device isn't that shocking to be honest. On these kind of laps the driver is well below his limits and the car's limit so the risk of crashing is very low. A car like this driven at 80% will still feel unreal to most people.
formula1,3dgnvm,theantijokef1,8,Thu Jul 16 13:54:26 2015 UTC,Also shows the amount of strength that F1 drivers have to hold their neck up under deceleration.
formula1,3dgnvm,sleepyoverlord,-49,Fri Jul 17 01:25:53 2015 UTC,it take very little strength actually. F1 drivers have a hans device that keeps their head from moving basically any direction. especially forward. this passenger didnt have one.
formula1,3dgnvm,Jashmid,18,Thu Jul 16 10:42:21 2015 UTC,Is that from personal experience? Have you seen the neck muscles on some of the drivers?

formula1,3dgnvm,trainspotting2,4,Thu Jul 16 17:34:45 2015 UTC,"Just to be sure though, the hans device allows mouvement of the neck, it just limits the maximum distance it can move. Drivers in F1 cockpits can and do still bang their heads against the sides of the cockpit if they don't counter-act the forces."
formula1,3dgnvm,xv323,10,Thu Jul 16 04:35:20 2015 UTC,Have you ever worn a HANS device? They do not limit the head movement to that degree especially side to side. They are made to limit the heads movement in a front impact.
formula1,3dgnvm,Stigface,3,Thu Jul 16 14:44:39 2015 UTC,"The HANS is there to prevent basilar fractures and other neck injuries in a crash, not to provide support during cornering and braking."
formula1,3dgnvm,TomF1,7,Thu Jul 16 05:27:25 2015 UTC,"That's incorrect. The HANS device, firstly, only stops forward movement, it doesn't stop movement in any other direction. Secondly, it's only really designed to prevent massive over-extension of the neck in a big crash where the deceleration is close to instantaneous - braking is a high-g situation but not so high-g that HANS comes into play.  Thirdly, and specifically with reference to this video - it's designed to work as an integrated system with the shoulder straps of a racing harness, so it would have been next to useless in this case with the straps loose."
formula1,3dgnvm,Woodsy921,6,Thu Jul 16 16:31:57 2015 UTC,"Wrong. The HANS devices still allow movement, just not as much as without one. It still requires incredibly strong neck muscles."

formula1,3df4vi,Dovahklutch,123,Wed Jul 15 19:56:52 2015 UTC,"I posted this in the /r/nba version of this thread, but I guess I may as well do it again here since it applies equally and I spent an inordinate amount of time writing it. Here's how I think F1 teams compare to NBA teams, though I'm leaving out a LOT of NBA teams.  Mercedes/Golden State Warriors - Dominant in all aspects (engine/aero/reliability for Mercedes, offense/defense/staying healthy for GSW), look set for the foreseeable future, and both relatively new to their success. Mercedes saw their first constructors championship last year after a few developmental seasons following their purchase of Brawn GP, and GSW with their first title after decades of wallowing around being generally disappointing.  Ferrari/Los Angeles Lakers - Discounting the fact that Ferrari is quite good right now, and the Lakers quite terrible, these two teams are probably the most analogous to one another. They're both historically very, very successful teams, both having some of the all time greats on their rosters (Schumacher/Lauda/Alonso/tons of others for Ferrari, Magic/Kareem/West/tons of others for the Lakers), have huge fan bases, and are generally disliked by anyone outside of those fan bases. That hate has subsided recently, however, as Arrivabene has taken over for Ferrari, and the Lakers have gotten shitty at basketball.  McLaren/Chicago Bulls - Historically great, with perhaps the single greatest driver/player of all time as part of their organizations (Jordan for the Bulls, Senna for McLaren though I personally disagree with Senna being the GOAT), though both have been generally disappointing as of late. McLaren has been hampered by a somewhat underwhelming chassis and as of this year, a terrible Honda engine, while the Bulls have been held back by constant injuries to their formerly best player, Derrick Rose.  Williams/Memphis Grizzlies - Both generally punching above their weight given their respective budget (Wiliams)/market (Grizzlies), and are fun to root for, however I don't think anybody ever expects either team to make it over the top. Still, both are very good, are more than capable of making noise every so often, and are extremely ready to jump on mistakes that other teams make and are terrific and cleaning those messes.  Force India/Washington Wizards - Both teams are generally on the rise, with a potentially fantastic cornerstone (Hulkenberg/Wall) perhaps being marginally held back by the equipment/roster put around them. Both teams are also kind of run by silly characters (Mallya/Whitman) whose teams have found success probably in spite of their involvement.  Lotus/Los Angeles Clippers - Despite some pretty strong successes in recent years, both seem to be foiled by bumbling mistakes on the part of someone involved with the franchise (Grosjean's constant crashing early in his career, Maldonado's constant crashing all the time, mismanagement of Kimi's salary for Lotus, abhorrent racism from Sterling, DeAndre Jordan turning his back on the Mavs after verbally agreeing to join them, and years and years of ineptitude for the Clippers).  Getting lazy here, so the rest are probably going to be a lot shorter.  Sauber/Sacramento Kings - Teams that were once both quite decent once upon a time, now scarred by laughable management (Kaltenborn for Sauber, Ranadive/Karl/whatever is going on with the Kings).  Manor/Phoenix Suns - Both featuring players/drivers who recently may as well have been killed (Forza Jules/RIP Brandon Knight) and I am going to hell for that.  Toro Rosso/New Orleans Pelicans - Young team with a star driver/player on the rise (Verstappen/Anthony Davis).  Red Bull/Miami Heat - Teams that were very recently dominant, that have fallen back to Earth VERY hard. Also, both had their stars leave them for opposition (Vettel to Ferrari, LeBron James to Cavs)."

They are really fun to root for because they have the ability to do really well, but they don't always do so.   I wouldn't call Williams all that smart though. They are known for making poor strategic decisions during a race. For example, the most recent race we had, a week and a half ago, Williams gave up what may have been a 1-2 finish, but almost certainly would have been a 2-3 finish, by making quite a few bad decisions. They finished 4-5, even after running 1-2 for the first 1/3 of the race."

They're not gonna be bad, but they will drop in the peck order a little.   I've spent the last 20 minutes trying to wrack my brain as to who would go where and my favourite so far is St. Louis - Lotus. Beautiful looking team, perpetually competitive except for very brief spells of awfulness, and a penchant for not being able to go all the way but sometimes put on a god-killing show.

The 76ers are currently among the worst teams in the league, as Haas will likely be in F1 once they begin racing, but as far as we can tell, both are building the ""right"" way. Haas has established a partnership with a known quantity like Ferrari, smartly swooped in on old Marussia assets, and maybe most importantly, been patient and realistic about expectations.  Similarly, while the 76ers are very near the bottom of the barrel at the moment, GM Sam Hinkie clearly has a plan to get the team back on the right path and ideally back into contention over the next decade. By being very particular about their roster moves, they are, at least in theory, maximizing their potential for future success even if it means sacrificing a bit in the short term.  Whether or not it pans out for either Haas or the 76ers, I guess we'll just have to wait and see."

formula1,3df4vi,EdwardMowinckel,60,Thu Jul 16 03:14:17 2015 UTC,"Well, Formula 1 is a very, very nuanced sport. While the car is crucially important, the drivers also play a factor, which is more important depends on who you ask.  So in Formula 1 we have 10 teams right now, Mercedes is at the very tippy top, and Manor-Marussia is at the very bottom. Mercedes cars are 3-6 seconds a lap quicker than the Manor-Marussias, and the biggest reason for this is how much they spend on development. Obviously the best teams make the most money, which means they can spend more money developing their car. The car development is mostly done by improving the aerodynamics of the car, but everything is always in the big picture.  The better the cars aerodynamics, the better downforce, and the better the downforce, the faster the car can go in the corners, the reason for this is all the aerodynamics are forcing the air to smash the car into the road, and as we've all heard, an F1 car can drive upside down, simply because all the fins and wings on the cars divert the air over it in such a way that it's pushing down very hard on the car. This allows the tyres to bite into the road better, thus providing grip, and better cornering.  However Formula 1 is not just the land of aerodynamic development, because too much aero and you have too much downforce, and after a point, it will make the car too slow on the straights, so a balance has to be struck. Enough downforce to make the tyres have enough grip in the corners, but not so much it makes you slow on the straights.  There's also drivers. Not all drivers are created equal, and while there are some drivers in cars that aren't as fast as the leaders, they're still brilliantly talented. There are also drivers in top teams who on pure driving and racing talent, might not be as good as drivers in slower cars. Every driver in F1 is a huge talent, anyone who can get any F1 car around a track at top speed is one of the worlds best, but among the best, there's always going to be a best, better, good, okay, and worst. If you put the worst driver who's still insanely talented in a top car, would they get the same lap times? There's room to disagree here, but I say no. There's a reason the best drivers often end up in the best teams.  Remember when I said car development is mostly done by improving aerodynamics? The other parts of that is everything else. All teams run the same tyres, though they're only allowed to choose between two compounds for every race weekend, and the compounds are decided by Pirelli, the company that supplies tyres. Dry weather tyres range from Super Soft, to Hard. Super Soft tyres offer the most grip, but can run for the fewest laps, and Hard tyres offer the least grip, but can run for the most laps. The wet weather tyres are Intermediate, and Wets. Intermediates are for when the track is wet, but still not wet enough to warrant full Wets. If it's raining big globs of rain, then you're on Wets. When teams go from dry weather tyres, to wet weather tyres is entirely their choice. Another caveat to tyres is that you MUST use both compounds specified by Pirelli (the F1 tyre supplier) during the  race. This requires a pit stop.  Another part of everything else is the engines. Presently Formula 1 cars are running V6 hybrid power engines, this only happened in 2014, and prior to that they were running normally aspirated V8s. The four engine suppliers right now are in order of competitiveness; Mercedes, Ferrari, Renault, and Honda. There is a HUGE difference in engine power between Honda and Mercedes. The engine manufacturers provide engines to their primary teams, for Mercedes it's well, Mercedes, Ferrari, uh, Ferrari, Renault powers the Red Bull Racing team as their primary team, and Honda powers McLaren exclusively. Still, most engine suppliers make their engines for sale, but their primary team gets the best and newest engines and engine parts. Contracts! Lawyers and contracts are very important in Formula 1.  The Drag Reduction System, or DRS is also huge in Formula 1. If you're within one second of the driver in front of you, you can activate your DRS, which opens a flap in the rear wing, and remember my downforce tangent, about how too much makes you slower in the straights? When you activate DRS and open that flap, you lose downforce, but it makes you faster in the straights. DRS is only allowed to be used in (usually) two parts of the track, and right before that part of the track there's a detection zone, usually two to three turns before the DRS zone, which is always the straightest part of the track. It makes overtaking a lot easier, and in my opinion, makes the races more exciting.   In Formula 1, there's presently no refueling, and during pitstops, only tyres are changed. A fast pitstop is about 2.3 seconds, a slow pitstop is 3.5, an average one is about 3.0. During a pitstop, teams are allowed to change the front wing if it gets damaged, as well they're allowed to adjust the angle of the fins on the front wing, this is done just with one little screw, and often doesn't even interfere with the pit stop time. They use a special tool that's calibrated to turn that bolt a precise amount, so say you need to turn that bolt 2.25 times counter clockwise, once you press the trigger on that tool, it turns it 2.25 times really really fast, so you just set it, press, and forget it.  A Formula 1 weekend is comprised of five primary events. Free Practise 1, 2, 3, Qualifying, and the race. Free Practise is there so teams can dial in their cars set up, this is crucially important, and can often mean the difference between a podium, and barely finishing in the points. Qualifying is broken up into three sections, Q1, Q2, and Q3. Everyone is on the track, driving as fast as they can. During Q1 (or qualifying 1), all cars are on the track. During Q1, the cars who post the 16th fastest time and slower get knocked out, and aren't allowed to partake in Q2, which is the second round of qualifying that has 15 cars. Then there's Q1, which has the top ten drivers. However if you do make it to Q1, the final ten cars in the qualifying session, the tyres you qualify on must be the ones you start the race with. This is a big deal, especially in tracks with the Super Soft tyres, because those often have as little as 10 laps in them before they need to be changed!  Formula 1 uses a standing start, which means all the cars start from a stationary position on the starting grid. Once the cars are all lined up, we have our formation lap, which is largely used to get the cars and tyres up to temperature. During the formation they follow the pace car for one lap at very slow speeds, after which they line up on the grid with their engines running and tyres with some heat in them. Then you'll see five unilluminated red lights, they'll all light up one by one, once all five are lit up, there's a delay of between 1-4 seconds (I think, correct me if I'm wrong), and then we're racing! You know how in drag racing the start time is always the same? It's the always the same interval. This lets the drivers train themselves to get on the throttle immediately when the lights go out, you'll often hear drag racers talk about a .000 start time, that means between the time the lights went on, and when they started accelerating is less than one thousandth of a second! Formula staggers their start time because bloody hell it makes things exciting!  During a race you'll come across flags. The most common one you'll see is a blue flag. Remember the Manor-Marussia team I mentioned 4708 characters ago? They see those a lot, because they're so much slower than the top teams. When a driver sees someone at the side of the track waving a blue flag, it means the car behind you is faster, get out of the way, this is a necessity as if another faster car is lapping a slower car and battling for track position, the lapped car who isn't racing either of those cars would just hold them up, and it'd be unfair to the drivers who are battling for position. The next most common flag is a yellow, which means slow down, there's a car off track. Double waved yellow flags mean be very, very careful, there's an incident up ahead that's already dicey, and it could get worse if everyone isn't careful! Whenever there's any yellow flag, you're not allowed to make any passing moves whatsoever There are also black flags, which means report to the pits, your car is too damaged to continue! Or report to the pits, you've been such a bad driver this race you're not allowed to race anymore! It's a very uncommon flag. There's also a red flag, which means everyone to the pits, something has gone terrible wrong. Most fans of motorsports feel butterflies in their stomach when they see a red flag after an incident, because it means something is terribly wrong, though they're also used when there's debris on the track that can't be safely cleared by track staff (the staff who wave flags and pick up debris are called marshals).  We also have the safety car, which when there's an incident that requires a car be moved from a position where it would be dangerous for marshals to recover, a safety car will be initiated, and all the cars will line up behind it, and drive slowly. Once you know no one's hurt, safety cars are very exciting, because it's like a brand new race again! If there was a six second gap between first and second and a safety comes out, second place can get right up behind first, and this applies all the way down. Race restarts after a safety car are very exciting. This year there's also been a Virtual Safety Car implemented, which is sometimes used in place of the safety car, however during a VSC (Virtual Safety Car), all cars must maintain a constant speed and not go over, so remember how I said if there's a six second gap between first and second, a safety car will moot that? With a VSC and everyone maintaining the same speed, rather than queuing up behind a safety car, all the gaps are maintained."

Though wiki says something interesting; ""In FIA International-permitted series, the black flag means an immediate disqualification for the driver involved. The car number of the summoned driver is displayed on the finish line. Some sanctioning bodies wave the black flag at all observation posts simultaneously to order all drivers to clear the track after the starter waves the red flag, often in the case of a serious accident.  When the black flag is used for disciplinary reasons in most races in North America, a driver is required to return to pit lane for at minimum a drive-through penalty.""  I had no idea it was used different in non-FIA series, I clearly need to watch some more IndyCar and USCC! The black and orange one means you have a mechanical issue that is a danger to other drivers.  Teams in F1 seem to be pretty damned good about knowing when they need to pit due to a mechanical problem that's a hazard to other drivers.

But in motorsports in general, the car plays a huge part in how successful you can be. The best driver in the world doesn't stand a chance if the car is shit (much like one LeBron alone isn't enough to win a title, even though it was close, tbh)  A good driver basically proves himself in being consistent, making as few mistakes as possible and interacting with his car (e.g. tire- and fuel-management) the optimal way.

formula1,3df4vi,zeusoid,9,Wed Jul 15 21:05:14 2015 UTC,"Discerning good and bad drivers is tricky for newcomers.  The cars are all different, and the drivers are generally competent.  The best way to compare drivers is to judge them against their current and historical teammates.  For example, Sebastian Vettel beat Mark Webber every year they were teammates.  This shows that Vettel is better than Webber, and probably better than the drivers Webber has defeated historically.  This isn't absolute however, as some drivers will do better with the rules in a given season (F1's car design rules change frequently).    Drivers can also be good at different types of things.  Some stand out as qualifying kings (Hamilton and Vettel), others are great at race starts (Fernando Alonso), others are great in the rain (Button), some are great passers (Hamilton), some are great ""race managers"" (Button, Alonso), and some are simply fast over a certain lap (Raikkonen).    Generally, I think the drivers break down like this:  Top Tier:  Fernando Alonso: Spanish.  Won the 2005 and 2006 championships with Renault, essentially ending Ferrari and Schumacher's dominance.  Since then, he has jumped to McLaren, back to Renault, then Ferrari, and now back to McLaren seeking his third championship, narrowly missing in 2007, 2010, and 2012.  Highly competitive, somewhat entitled, incredibly skilled.  While it is heavily debated, I think a plurality would agree that Alonso is the best driver in F1.  Currently at McLaren-Honda, which is a horrible horrible car, leading to very poor results that can't be put on his shoulders.  Best pass ever.  Sebastian Vettel:  German. Meteoric rise in the late 2000's, beginning his career with BMW as a backup, then Toro Rosso (Red Bull's B-team) where he managed to win the 2008 Italian Grand Prix, making him the youngest driver to win a race, with a team that ""shouldn't"" have been able to win a race.  He went to Red Bull in 2009, where he challenged for the championship against Jenson Button and Brawn GP (now Mercedes).  He went on to win the championship in 2010, 2011, 2012, and 2013, making him one of the most successful drivers of all time.  This is his first year at Ferrari and he's been the most successful driver this season that isn't in a Mercedes.  People got kinda sick of him at Red Bull, but his popularity has increased at Ferrari.    Lewis Hamilton:  British.  Entered F1 in 2007 at McLaren and was instantly competing for the championship.  In his rookie season he tied with teammate and champion Fernando Alonso (beating him in the tiebreaker) for second in the championship, one point behind the winner.  He VERY narrowly won the 2008 championship against Felipe Massa and Ferrari.  Mixed results from 2009 to 2012, including losing to teammate Jenson Button in 2011.  Left for Mercedes in 2013 and has dominated the 2014 and 2015 seasons with a stellar vehicle.  Has an obnoxious personal life.  Friends with Kanye...  Second Tier:   Jenson Button:  British.  At the twilight of his career.  Only really had a competitive car under him a couple of seasons, but won the 2009 championship with Brawn GP (formerly Honda, then sold to Mercedes).  Only driver to beat Lewis Hamilton as teammates.  Statistically the best wet weather driver in F1.  He seems to have a better understanding of the sport than most drivers and ""manages"" races better than almost anyone.  Probably won't accomplish very much this season with Honda-McLaren.  Considered a playboy early on, but now a gentleman of F1, married to a Japanese-Argentine model.    Kimi Raikkonen:  Finnish.  Would have been considered top tier two seasons ago, but seems to be slipping towards the end of his career.  In the 2000s, he challenged Michael Schumacher and Fernando Alonso for championships, winning his first and only championship with Ferrari in 2008.  Took two seasons off and returned with Lotus-Renault, where he saw unexpected success.  Transferred back to Ferrari in 2014, where he was annihilated by Alonso.  It seems that Vettel is getting the best of him as well.  Famously quick in races, setting fastest laps in 42 races, over his career, making him #2 all time behind Schumacher.  Notorious for his hilarious ""I don't care"" attitude and short answers to the media.  Best pass ever  Third Tier:  Nico Rosberg: German/Monaco.  Son of a former F1 champion.  Entered F1 in 2006 and drove for Williams until 2009.  Showed a ton of promise in slower cars.  Went to Mercedes to take Button's seat in 2010 and beat teammate Michael Schumacher (on a 3 year comeback, similar to Jordan at the Wizards).  He's very good, but doesn't quite seem to have the killer instinct of the very top drivers.  Beaten by Hamilton in 2014, but seems to be challenging him again this season.    Felipe Massa:  Brazilian.  Tons of bad luck, including a freak accident in 2009 that almost killed him (a part shot out the back of the car in front of him and hit him in the helmet).  Stuck behind Schumacher, Alonso, and Raikkonen for much of his career.  Almost won the championship in 2008, beating out Raikkonen, but losing out to Hamilton who picked up the last needed point in the last corner of the last race.    Daniel Ricciardo: Australian.  Started F1 in 2011.  Quickly moved from the bad teams up to Red Bull in 2014, where he shockingly beat Sebastian Vettel.  Might actually be a tier up.  Fastest driver this season with a Renault engine.    Valtteri Bottas: Finnish.  Entered F1 in 2013.  Has been showing great promise with Williams.  Possible replacement for Raikkonen at Ferrari.    Nico Hulkenberg: German.  Very successful in other racing series, but hasn't had a great car in F1 yet.  Shows promise.  Could wind up at Ferrari when Raikkonen is done.  Has been bouncing around teams.    Romain Grosjean: French.  Was briefly in F1 in 2009, then returned to F1 in 2013.  His 2012 season was a disaster, causing major crashes twice (potentially costing Alonso the championship).  Has steadily improved, scoring several podiums in 2013, and is pretty safe in his seat.    Everyone Else  Daniil Kvyat:  Russian.  Probably only in F1 because of the sponsorship money he brings.    Sergio Perez:  Mexican.  In F1 since 2011.  Somewhat dangerous.    Pastor ""Crashtor"" Maldonado: Venezuelan.  Dangerous.  Crashes frequently, frequently reprimanded.    Max Verstappen: Dutch.  Brand new and 17 years old, a record.  Has shown signs he could be good, but hard to judge without a complete season or two under his belt.    Felipe Nasr: Brazilian.  Same story as Verstappen.    Carlos Sainz: Spain.  See above.  Marcus Ericsson: Swedish.  See above.  Roberto Mehri: Spain.  See above.    Will Stephens: Britain.  See above."
formula1,3df4vi,oGsMustachio,5,Wed Jul 15 22:25:05 2015 UTC,"Qualifier on the rest, from their junior careers, Nasr should be the best.  Whilst Maldonado crashes frequently, he is a fast driver and also a grand prix winner.  Kvyat is there because of the Redbull driver program, he has been promoted through their ranks and therefore around on merit!   Same with Sainz and Verstappen, part of the Redbull driver program and have been promoted to their junior F1 team from junior formulas.  *And his second and third tier drivers are pretty much interchangeable depending on one's particular allegianc."
formula1,3df4vi,zeusoid,3,Wed Jul 15 22:43:37 2015 UTC,"Kvyat got promoted despite coming in second behind his teammate Jean-Eric Vergne, who wasn't exactly considered a standout driver.  While he did win GP3 in 2013, that doesn't exactly qualify someone for the seat that Sebastian Vettel held for six seasons.    I don't really ever see Kyat or Maldonado being elite drivers in F1 unless they find themselves in great cars with crappy teammates."
formula1,3df4vi,dereksteinke,3,Wed Jul 15 22:54:51 2015 UTC,"I was just pointing out that it's false to say and label him as a pay driver when he has always been a part of their driver program.  And he technically moved into Dani Ric' s seat not Vettel's  Who, how, why and when they get promoted is a Redbull secret, Verstappen should not have got this year's Toro Rosso seat if you compared him to other Redbull junior driver results last year!"
formula1,3df4vi,doxlg,2,Wed Jul 15 23:05:59 2015 UTC,"Red Bull doesn't promote drivers because of sponsorship, so you can't say that Kvyat is a pay driver. He's currently tied at 3-3 against Ricciardo in races where they've both finished and trailing 4-5 in quali. Kvyat's out-qualified Ricciardo in 4 out of the last 5 races as well.  For a driver in only his second season, he seems to be doing pretty well to me."
formula1,3df4vi,ZotoZhaan,1 point,Thu Jul 16 04:30:34 2015 UTC,"Kvyat had a very impressive junior record, look up his exceptional FR2.0 results against highly talented fields. His domination of the second half of his debut GP3 season is also very impressive. He's still raw, but is also still inexperienced and young. I think he potentially could be the best prospect RBR has brought into F1 so far."

It used to be Jenson Button, who spent most of his career driving poor cars, then one year got an amazing car, won the championship. Fairy tale stuff. Nico Hulkenberg is a bit like the new Jenson. Lots of talent, but he's about halfway through his career and never won a race. It always looks like he's gonna get his big break, then he doesn't. He recently took part in the Le Mans 24 hour race, a different sport all together but a very prestigious one, and he amazingly won it. That's like some Basketball player being world class at a slightly different sport. Hopefully next year he gets a good car, but even if he does get it, the team will suddenly become crap :(.

But the overall series underdogs is the Manor team. McLaren, one of the most successful teams in F1 history is running around the back with Manor at the moment because (mainly) of their Honda engine.  Honda has not been in F1 for a handful of years now, and they came back this year but had to build an engine to the new specifications. It seems they tried for an aggressive design which turned out unreliable. There is talk about the team getting things together, and if they ever do this year, it could be a mighty turn around. A lot of doubt around that though. McLaren does have two world champion drivers currently...so they are bummed about it. So in some sense they could be considered an underdog, but in another sense the underdogs are beating this historically successful team."
formula1,3df4vi,-Andar-,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:25:36 2015 UTC,"Consistency. A good driver will turn in lap times that are the same give or take a couple hundredths of a second.

formula1,3df4vi,sleepyoverlord,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:36:26 2015 UTC,"A good indicator is who performs the best in the rain. The performance of the car is somewhat mitigated and it requires more delicate car control (feathering of the throttle and using a lot of counter-steer to prevent spinning). Even though Vettel won his 4 championships with a car that was worlds better than the field, nobody doubts his skill based on what he can do in wet weather (and how he has routinely beat his teammates).  Another great indicator is relative performance to their teammate. If your teammate is generally towards the middle of the pack, but you are fighting for a podium position regularly, you're probably outperforming the car. This is why Alonso is regarded so highly. His teammate, Kimi Raikonnen was much slower and most people thought that Kimi's speed was the true speed of the car and that Alonso was out performing the car."

F1 is a weird one, technical changes to the car are exciting and also dumb things like Lewis Hamilton is at Mens fashion week in New York right now amuse us too.   The fact that its so hard to win, there are so few races and the prize is so big makes the whole 'sport' the a big, international, real life, winner takes all drama.

I'm not talking about your county-fair kiddy karts but real outdoor fast go karts.  Before I moved to the wrong side of the Atlantic, I'd got to Summit Point in West Virginia and while it's not cheap, it's ridiculously fun.  You show up, go through a safety video, grab helmets and drive as fast as you can around a track.  The first time I went, we were all pretty wiped after 4 sessions or so but eventually I got to the point where I did an endurance race with a couple friends and it's super fun.  At Summit Point, if you get under a certain time (depending on weight), you get to drive a faster kart and those were able to get over 75 mph which is insane when you're 2 inches off the ground.    I did a quick search on groupon and found this which definitely seems worthwhile.  With four people, it's $20 each per session and I'd recommend planning on doing 2 or 3.  The first one, you will probably just be trying to stay in control and in the 2nd and 3rd you might be able to start thinking about a racing line and going faster (unless you are a prodigy, expect to be ridiculously off the pace of the faster people even after doing several sessions).    Basically, I imagine you'd agree that the best way to get into and learn basketball is to actually play.  You obviously can't go out and drive an F1 car but you will feel like it if you get into a go kart.  Best case, you go and enjoy it and turn into an addict like the rest of us.

Jordan wins out because he has the championships and individual accolades.  He also blows the ""eye-test"" away.  He was the most dominant shooting guard we've ever seen.  He did it on the offensive and defensive ends as well.   Wilt is a bit of an anomaly.  He played in a very different era where he had the opportunity to put up the absurd numbers he did.  The rules were different, and they were mostly to his advantage.  That being said, Wilt is just one of the best athletes we've ever seen in league history.

Being that it was a manual, I obviously used the hand brake every time I drove the car, so I was used to seeing that light on when I pulled the HB, I assumed the switch for the light was stuck on...Nope, my brake pads didn't need replacing like I though, my rear brake lines had both rusted through and I had, over time, pushed all the brake fluid out of the system until the brakes went from shit to non-existent...and suddenly I realized why the light was 'stuck' on.

formula1,3dg6s6,lintstah1337,24,Thu Jul 16 00:42:22 2015 UTC,"If the car gets a little bit of air for whatever reason, yes the downforce generated by ground effect would rapidly decrease, but that's not really why the cars flipped over in these clips.   I would say that if the nose is a foot or two in the air then the ground-effect downforce is already gone.  The fact that the underside of the car was a solid flat wing is what made those WEC cars rise up the rest of the way and do dramatic backflips.   In WEC they've already mandated wheel vents (example) that counteract this quite well, and now that they've had a couple years they've figured out ways to minimize the adverse effects of the vents on racing performance.  I'm not sure if F1 will mandate vents or not in 2017 -- F1 is open wheel racing, after all, so maybe it doesn't need them -- but I'm (maybe unjustifiably) confident that it's been looked into and some version of them will be implemented if it's needed to avoid a similar ""flying wing"" situation.   (As dereksteinke noted, a car could also be launched from the wrong kind of wheel contact, but that has nothing to do with ground effect really and I don't think the risk/crash would be any worse than it is now.)   The old hazard with ground effect back in the skirt days happened when one side of the car got too much air from a kerb, broke the vacuum soft-seal, and suddenly lost downforce.  The problem wasn't that it lifted the car (it didn't), the problem was that the car suddenly lost cornering grip (since being on a kerb usually means you're taking a high speed corner).  This would make the car dive (understeer - no front grip) or spin (oversteer - no back grip) completely off the track and then, as they say, it would head directly to the scene of the accident.  Those accidents were very high speed trips into the barriers, and that's why those kind of ground effects were banned for safety reasons.  IMO that's the kind of safety hazard that might be introduced with more ground effect aero, instead of the risk of airborne acrobatics."

formula1,3dg6s6,ceribus_peribus,8,Thu Jul 16 16:13:12 2015 UTC,"I agree 100% with your final paragraph. The story of GE cars having an increased risk of flipping compared to current regs is IMHO incorrect, or at the very least overestimated. I feel the risk is relatively similar between current F1 cars and possible 2017 GE F1 cars. You still have a mostly flat surface under the cars currently, and as soon as nose angle increases one or two feet above the ground, most of the aero downforce will be useless anyways. Thats also why Webber went flying when he hit Heikki: in addition to the upthrust that the wheel contact gave, the car underside had become a large aerofoil, and physics took over.  The real risk is cornering downforce loss leading to high speed barrier impact, not really from any increased risk of back-flips."

IMO that's the kind of safety hazard that might be introduced with more ground effect aero, instead of the risk of airborne acrobatics.   Today's tracks are infinitely safer than in the early 80s, though. Most high speed corners have huge asphalted run-off areas, so the risks would be a lot smaller than in the first era of ground effects."

This is not to say ground effects wouldn't be more concerning but just that aero performance by its nature has such problems.

There won't be fans sucking the air in a sealed skirt, that's for sure, so we can already have a less knee-jerky reaction about safety etc.  It will probably be just enough so they can follow each other closely, which is already possible (right on the edge), just not optimal. So it won't be much difference there.  The biggest difference will come from the car being wider with wider tires"
formula1,3dg6s6,dpfagent,0,Thu Jul 16 04:48:18 2015 UTC,"The amount of downforce you'd have to take from the top to put underneath to achieve the results the strategy group wants is pretty significant.  Sure, the FIA could implement very limited ground effects, but that would provide very little benefit.  And just because there aren't skirts doesn't mean it's a-okay, the dangers are pretty similar.  It means taking too much curb could lead spinning off at high speeds, or a relatively small bump could unsettle the car enough to send it off.  Might not seem like much, but a track like Monaco would ve pretty fucking scary when a mild bump at the wrong angle can send you straight into the wall."
formula1,3dg6s6,jetshockeyfan,7,Thu Jul 16 06:05:43 2015 UTC,"I find it hilarious how people think FIA doesn't know the dangers of ground effect or that simply because you are using ground effect, suddenly every other aerodynamic force and tire grip disappears and every bump causes the car to go flying.  Your entire argument relies on the ""fact"" that :   The amount of downforce you'd have to take from the top to put underneath to achieve the results the strategy group wants is pretty significant.    You are not taking stuff from the top to put underneath, you are adding on it.  The reason ground effect was so dangerous in the past is because they relied a lot more on it, the other forces were less important, so naturally if you lost ground effect, you lost the car completely"
formula1,3dg6s6,dpfagent,2,Thu Jul 16 06:30:08 2015 UTC,"If you simply add more downforce you end up with quicker lap times, but the car behind is still losing time from dirty air.  The way to reduce that is by reducing the downforce that comes from elements that are severely affected by dirty air, basically the topside downforce.  Even in your situation where it's just adding more downforce, you still run into the problem of sudden loss of grip.  Sure, the wings and tires are still providing downforce, but that's pretty irrelevant.  If you're going through a corner and suddenly lose a chunk of downforce, you're going to have a problem.  How big of a problem that is depends on how much downforce you lose.  With the current aero kits, the only way to lose that kind of downforce is if a wing falls off, or something similarly drastic.  It's a hell of a lot easier to have issues with ground effects."

Cars can already follow each other closely even in today's formula where turbulent air disrupts the performance completely. The problem is that it's simply not efficient or particularly comfortable.  Just see Bottas vs Massa last race for example.   How big of a problem that is depends on how much downforce you lose.    And that's my point, ground effect won't be ridiculous like it used to be so even if they lose that, which will be on pretty extraordinary cases, not just ""every bump"" like you are saying, since they have tires and suspension, it won't send the cars flying off"

Skirts are what cause the seal to from complete to nothing.  With no skirts, there is no such thing as a sudden loss of downforce with underbody tunnels.  It doesn't matter what you drive, a massive curb hit on the edge of aero of mechanical grip will cause issues.  Lots of series have underbody tunnels generating downforce, with no issues ever."
formula1,3dg6s6,Indestructavincible,1 point,Fri Jul 17 10:27:35 2015 UTC,"the dangers are pretty similar.   They are not.  The skirts meant the floor was sealed to the track.  No skirts means just like now, where they use ground effect and the rake of the car with vortices used to seal it generated from the front wings and amplified by the bargeboards and tea tray.  Right now if a car hits a curb, it upsets the ground effect generated by the front wing and floor and loses grip.  Ground effect loses df every mm is rises up, but it happens gradually when there are no skirts.  This is why Indy Cars have ZERO issues running on VERY BUMPY road tracks.  This is also why that with ground effect and no skirts, F1 cars will also have no issues.  Suddenly experts everywhere."
formula1,3dg6s6,Indestructavincible,11,Fri Jul 17 10:24:41 2015 UTC,"I think the biggest problem would be spinning around and ending up going backwards at a high speed.  The wings and diffuser would end up creating lift as an inherent opposite.  It used to happen all the time in nascar, until they started using roof and hood flaps that open up at high speeds in reverse.  I'm sure they'd lift off like Webber did, if enough air went under them going forward.  I figure anything higher than the actual balance from front to rear beyond a linear line could make them lift a bit.  From pics and watching the past two season, it seems like they're using a lot of rake in comparison to the past to increase the angle of the car with air hitting it overall.  From my understanding, the more rake the more rear downforce you need.  In terms of physics, given that most teams are running 50/50 weight ratio or damn near it..rake should naturally create understand with a lack of rear downforce.  Rules and all that crap come into play with this stuff.  Idk them well enough.  I just remember that older cars looked pretty level from front to rear, compared to these."

These are just a couple examples, and I'm sure someone else with more of an engineering background can give much better analysis.  Edit: It's worth remembering that the P1, LaFerrari, and the Porsche 918 are all over $1 million, so as far as F1's current influence over the majority of road car development/production, I'd say its not really that significant, until all cars can boast such systems for competitive prices."

formula1,3dj3wq,GraemeH,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:12:52 2015 UTC,"Pretty much nothing.  Road car R&D budgets are orders of magnitude higher than F1, anything that benefits road cars comes from the road car R&D with marketing coming from F1. Not to mention there are no arbitrary rules limiting research and development for road cars, whereas there are heavy restrictions for F1 development.  People will talk about hybrids or active suspension and whatnot, but most of these things either appeared on road cars in some way first or were only not on road cars first due to the necessity of keeping the unit cost down when selling cars to the public (carbon fibre, monocoques etc.), not because an F1 team with a $200m budget hamstrung by regulations somehow invented something useful for road cars that a road car division's R&D didn't come up with with billions of dollars of budget and no restrictions..."

formula1,3dc82a,MrSeksy,42,Wed Jul 15 05:31:52 2015 UTC,"The fine in the Webber/Alonso situation wasn't for the ride, but because other drivers had to go around Alonso when he stopped."
formula1,3dc82a,AUS_Doug,19,Wed Jul 15 06:28:52 2015 UTC,"It should be remembered that Alonso received a reprimand for causing a dangerous situation (2 cars had to go round him) and Webber got a reprimand for walking back on to the circuit without asking a marshals for permission, something they would have almost certainly given. Because that was Marks 3rd reprimand he got an automatic grid penalty for the next race.                         It's unfortunate as it makes the stewards look like dicks but the rules are rules and have to be followed. The same happened with Vettel's donuts in India 2013 when he didn't bring the car back to parc ferme and so got a reprimand. Now in that incident the FIA tried to be clever and wrote a new article to allow the winner to do donuts but it is so badly written as to be almost hilarious.   44.3 After receiving the end-of-race signal all cars must proceed on the circuit directly to the post race parc fermé without any unnecessary delay, without receiving any object whatsoever and without any assistance (except that of the marshals if necessary). An exception to Article 30.4 and to the above will be made for the winning driver who may perform an act of celebration before reaching parc fermé, provided any such act : a) Is performed safely and does not endanger other drivers or any officials. b) Does not call into question the legality of his car. c) Does not delay the podium ceremony.   A, B & C were not any different in the old regulations. Under these regulations Vettel would still be given a reprimand for not bringing the car back to parc ferme. The only difference between this and what was written in the old regs is ""and to the above will be made for the winning driver"" meaning only the winning driver can do an act of celebration now.  Only the FIA could set out to write a ruleset to allow you to do donuts and end up with a ruleset which bans them for nearly all of the gird."
formula1,3dc82a,zantkiller,2,Wed Jul 15 09:31:07 2015 UTC,I'm confused as to why you believe the updated rule is worthless. It seems pretty fair to me. Are you saying donuts will be viewed by the FIA as tampering with the legal weight of the car?
formula1,3dc82a,Apex_Steez,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:41:25 2015 UTC,"Before the regulation was added, 43.3 was just this:   43.3 After receiving the end‐of‐race signal all cars must proceed on the circuit directly to the post race parc fermé without any unnecessary delay, without receiving any object whatsoever and without any assistance (except that of the marshals if necessary).     That does not stop a driver from doing a celebration before getting the car back to parc ferme. We saw many drivers do them and no one got a reprimand because they all brought the cars back to parc ferme. Vettel did not bring his car back to parc ferme so quite rightly got the reprimand. With the current rules you still have to bring the car back to parc ferme so he would still get a reprimand.  The addition they made serves no purpose as it was already covered in the rules. The only thing it does is making reference specifically to the ""Winning Driver"" meaning that when Felipe Massa performed donuts at the end of the 2013 Brazilian GP, if that rule was in place he would have been breaching said rule and would have been up for a reprimand regardless of the fact that he got it back to parc ferme.  They wrote a regulation to legalise something that was already legal and ended up banning it for 95 % of the grid. That is just mad."

It would've been really undeserving of the mark he left on the sport and the incredible drives he put in if he had left the sport without winning a championship.

I like his overhaul of Catalunya and Hockenheim. Istanbul and Shanghai are really cool too; Yas Marina and Marina Bay have their strong points as well. I'm not big on Valencia and I'm still trying to give Sochi a fair shot despite last year. I'm not a fan of the Baku layout, but we're yet to race there so I'm not sure on that one.  I also think that he gets the same undue blame that Pirelli get for the tires. He's designing tracks in conjuction with the FIA and with all the regulations and ideas therein. If they told him to make the tracks more punishing, he probably would; just like if the FIA told Pirelli to make the stickiest tires ever, they could."

Sure the revisions to Catalunya and Hockenheim arent great but they could be worse. Tracks like Istanbul, Sepang, Valencia, Buddh, Bahrain, Sochi and the new Silverstone layout are amazing. CotA is one of the best layouts to come along in over a decade. Sure this is more the work of Tavo Hellmund but Tilke had a hand too.   I know Sochi isnt a popular pic but i think the layout has promise. Last year put a bad taste in everyones mouth as Pirelli picked the wrong tyres and it was yet again a Merc runaway. This year will be much better and just like a lot of those tracks they just need some races under their belt. Give them a few years and you will see they are great additions.

formula1,3ddvpn,Mezzos,9,Wed Jul 15 15:26:04 2015 UTC,Isn't also part of that because the Mercedes engine is specifically designed for the chassis of the works team?
formula1,3ddvpn,GalacticPoltergeist,0,Wed Jul 15 19:06:58 2015 UTC,"Possibly to a small degree, but isn't the back end build around the engine anyway, rather than the engine made for the car?"

The Merc chassis was already on the come up in 2013, and once they solved their tire eating woes.  The Merc front wing is the most complex and Ferrari and even Red Bull have abandoned thier previous FW philosophies and are adapting that of the Merc.  That has nothing to do with the engine. The engine route is just a cheap excuse for people to not admit Mercedes have done a fantastic job all round 2 years running now."
formula1,3ddvpn,ngwe23,2,Thu Jul 16 00:02:02 2015 UTC,"People would rather go for the simpler examplanation where possible.  In this case attributing  Merc's domination to the engine is easier than taking into account the rest of the car. I wouldn't be surprised if Mercedes continues to kick ass even when other teams catch up in pure horsepower terms. Indeed, Ferrari is closer in that regard than last year but they are still miles off pace. RB kicked ass even when the rivals copied the EBD.  In many ways I think the engine issue is a red herring."

Indeed - I have seen several respected sources claiming that as of their Canada upgrade, Ferrari's engine is only 15 horsepower or so behind Mercedes'. That's similar to the power gap between Mercedes and Renault in the V8 era, which didn't stop Red Bull from dominating.  The Mercedes works team have consistently been the fastest through high, medium and low speed corners, and Horner claimed that their GPS data suggests that Mercedes' chassis is about 2 or 3 tenths better than the rest of the field's. A good chunk of Ferrari's deficit is still coming from the chassis, which Arrivabene blames the previous regime for. There has been much fanfare around the ""Ferrari revival"", but IMO Ferrari are still yet to prove they can produce a chassis that is the class of the field. Since the regulation change in 2009, their chassis have been missing at least 2 or 3 tenths to the best team every year. The last time they built the best chassis was probably 2008, and much of that was founded on the base they built up during the Ross Brawn/Jean Todt/Schumacher glory years."

In this he is not necessarily wrong."
formula1,3ddvpn,jigielnik,-4,Wed Jul 15 16:15:05 2015 UTC,"And if they had a good n°2 driver instead of Barrichello, they'd have dominated even harder than merc does right now.  Just like RB would have dominated harder if they had someone better than Webber.  Merc has the current strongest driver lineup. Only McHonda has more talent at their disposal, too bad they don't matter. Shows you how much it fucking sucks that McHonda failed to deliver.  Ferrari has Vettel, sure. They also have Raikkonen, who should have retired at least 4 seasons ago. RB has Kvyat (lol).  Williams is the proof to me that Merc still has a lot of room for improvement, car wise. I mean, Williams can somewhat challenge the Mercs even though they have second rate drivers like Bottas and Massa.   Y'all better hold on to your butts, 'cuz we're in for some few more years of Merc winning everything, unless something is done to shaft them just like everything was done to shaft RBR back then."
formula1,3ddvpn,idiotseparator,6,Wed Jul 15 16:49:20 2015 UTC,"I think his point is that if there had been a second Schumacher in Ferrari, at least position 1 wouldn't default to him. Right now Rosberg is close behind Hamilton."

I just added that if Ferrari back then had a lineup like Merc has today, they would have had 99% of the available points.  Merc has had a dominant car these two seasons, but not the most dominant of F1 history  But all this domination talk is pointless, really. Mercedes isn't to blame for the lack of entertainment during the races.   It's shit like shit aero regs, DRS, uninspiring new tracks, the lack of budget cap etc that's ruining the sport."

I agree with you... but my point was more that at least in 2002 and 2004, there were various teams making it to the podium and also various teams winning races, even if Ferrari was super dominant. 2004 had 9 people on the podium. This year it's 6 and looking unlikely to change.   Also, I don't personally find only two drivers battling to be enough ""more exciting"" to make up for the fact that only one team is winning every single race.. but that's just me.  And then there's the final fact, which is that even though they're kind of fighting... it really doesn't feel like a fight this year the way it did in 2014. Yes I know Nico has had some wins, but even with all of it, it just doesn't feel like he stands a chance. Lewis is beating him even when it appears that for the entire week Lewis is out partying while Nico is training. It's not like Prost/Senna level stuff and even in the heat of 2014 it wasn't like that, it was mostly the media making it seem that way."

Now you don't have to like that socialite side of Lewis but it's a little far out to imply that his social life makes him less dedicated/focused than others."
formula1,3ddvpn,Timothy_Claypole,2,Wed Jul 15 21:47:14 2015 UTC,None of the drivers are 100% focussed on F1. They take time off. The difference being that Hamilton's R&R ends up in the news.

formula1,3ddvpn,dpfagent,-10,Wed Jul 15 16:09:06 2015 UTC,"You missed my point - even though Schumacher had no threat from Rubens, it wasn't a 100% guarantee that Ferrari would win every race, the way that this season is with Mercedes.   Furthermore in those seasons the podiums were also way more mixed up. 9 different drivers were on the podium. And I'm not trying to say that 2004 was some totally super competitive season... but this season only 6 different people have been on the Podium and that number doesn't look to be a growing any time soon."

The fact of the matter is simple: there pretty much has never been this dominant of a team in the history of the sport.   Even Ferrari's most dominant seasons were, factually, not as dominant as Mercedes is right now.

Back then you had unlimited spending and unlimited testing. Teams could catch up by simply spending more and testing more.   Today, with all teams having the same token allowance, it basically means whoever starts out ahead can never be caught."

Nearly all of the teams which used tokens have won championships in the past... they know what they're doing.   There are SO many people on this sub convinced that Mercedes is simply smarter and more clever than every other team and that's the sole reason they're winning... I wish that were true because it would make this dominant season easier to swallow, but it just is not the case.    Just because other manufacturers can't produce a decent engine doesn't mean the token system is broken.   If 75% of the engine manufacturers involved cannot produce a competitive engine under the regulations, the issue is not with manufacturers, it's with the regulations."

Mercedes' engine doesn't have some amazing innovation making it faster, or more reliable, they simply started developing before everyone else, knowing that the token system would make it impossible for people to catch up.    I can understand Ferrari not being the top dog here because that V6 was probably the first they built in decades. But what the hell, Renault, Honda? How do you manage to produce a V6 engine that bad?   Both of these points are irrelevant because the PUs used in Formula One have almost nothing in common with any engine that any of those companies has ever produced, V6 or otherwise."

They're closer to the maximum potential of their package and the law of diminishing returns means that, eventually, someone will catch up.   However, due to the hindrance that is the token system, it may be a while until we see that happen"
formula1,3ddvpn,mrzambaking,3,Wed Jul 15 15:28:27 2015 UTC,"But what do we know? Diminishing returns exist but their base package is obviously the best engine. We have no idea how much they can still improve their power-train relative to other teams. While other teams have far more room for improvement, we can never be sure how much Mercedes is pushing the envelope on their engines."
formula1,3ddvpn,Zeta-Omega,3,Wed Jul 15 15:52:55 2015 UTC,"Due to the token system, the manufacturers need to be absolutely sure what they're spending their tokens on is worth it. Tokens are non refundable. There's no point rushing a Turbocharger upgrade for 10 BHP in April, when you can get one for 30 BHP in September (arbitrary figures). They'd have to spend the tokens twice. There is a long lead time on these PU upgrades. I'm pretty certain that Mercedes are still going at 100% to improve their PU, and that they are pushing the envelope to develop their engines. The lag time is so big that if they weren't, it could really hurt them is let's say Ferrari suddenly overtook them. The lag time would be so big that they couldn't just expect to fire out upgrades in the next month.  Currently they have the best package, but due to the restrictive nature of these rules, there aren't that many big conceptual differences between these PU concepts. It's not like the WEC where the top LMP1 manufacturers are all running 4 completely different concepts with less cross-over. These relatively restrictive rules leads me to believe that the PU's will all level out at around the same point, which is what the rules set out to achieve. Mercedes are clearly closer to the performance ceiling than everyone else. Therefore, due to diminishing returns, I find it reasonable to believe  Mercedes have less room to improve their PU"
formula1,3ddvpn,Ronypeg,2,Wed Jul 15 16:18:49 2015 UTC,"...law of diminishing returns...   That's exactly what the pundits were saying last year and look at where we are. That law only works in a stable system - no regs changes AND no revolutionary inventions.  As it is, Merc can still improve their engine, they have the best aero and they have ""a trick"" with their suspension that gives them extra mechanical grip compared to others, so that law doesn't apply.  I'm not saying they won't be overtaken, but it took a massive rule change to stop RB domination."
formula1,3ddvpn,John_Manhunter,2,Wed Jul 15 16:16:00 2015 UTC,"No one expected it to be done overnight. In my opinion, there are two things stopping the other teams catching up. The token system, and the lack of in-season testing.   The lack of testing really hurts them because they're all running relatively new technology that is more or less untested in this environment. They need all the track data they can get, and with limited testing they can't do that. That limits the rate that they can find and fix problems that they already have, and limits the time they can work on improving the PU.   The token system is a hindrance to development. Combined with the fact that they're only allowed 4 PU's per year, development and chances to catch up are limited."

formula1,3ddvpn,fluffleofbunnies,1 point,Fri Jul 17 00:15:11 2015 UTC,I had this thought about the engines today.    There isn't much development going on with engines.  There is probably a crap ton of work going on in the factories designing engines.  But there is no testing of those engines in the car.    So what I see the difference being is that Mercedes gets to spend all of this year planning and making a great engine even better.   Ferrari is probably in a similar situation to Mercedes.  Renault/Honda get to spend all year trying to figure out what's wrong with their engines.  When it comes to Winter testing they will be working on fixing their issues.  While Mercedes and Ferrari get to squeeze out more performance.   I think this is where domination is going to continue to happen.  I could be totally wrong though.

formula1,3dgln7,CauliflowerMAN,17,Thu Jul 16 02:47:39 2015 UTC,"F1 pit crews wear fireproof suits during races, similar to the ones drivers wear. They also wear helmets, though these differ considerably from drivers' helmets. (McLaren's old design looked quite nice, though.) Someone else correct me if I'm wrong, but I think mechanics are still allowed to wear T-shirts and shorts during practice and qualifying sessions.  Teams rely on a mix of custom-made and off-the-shelf tools. You'll see that for most teams, such as McLaren, a semi-automated traffic light system informs the driver when his pit stop has been completed. I don't have a lot of solid information regarding where they come from, but I'm reasonably sure they're custom-made; no other racing series uses them, and I'm not sure where else their technology could be applied.  Wheelguns and jacks are either custom-made or heavily customized off-the-shelf models, all to shave precious fractions of seconds off pitstops. However, you'll often see mechanics using off-the-shelf leaf blowers (albeit debadged due to commercial considerations), such as these, to cool cars' brakes as they're being wheeled back into the garage.  Teams also used to use wrenches to adjust cars' front wing flap angles during pit stops, but teams have moved towards using custom-built wing adjuster tools.  Edit: Added more photos"

The wheel guns used by many teams are made by Paoli, an Italian manufacturer.  The tool used for wing adjustment is a standard Bosch battery-powered wrench but with a custom attachment to ensure the exact number of turns required.  The new swivel-type jacks that are used by every team used to or still use the carbon fiber handlebar from a bicycle with the brake lever used to pull the cable that drops the car back down. The rest of the jack is custom made with a mix of carbon fiber and strong lightweight metal alloy (not sure which one) for rigidity and to make sure they don't break.  The fire proof suits will be the usual pit crew wear sold by companies like Alpinestars, Sparco, etc. But with their own designs and sponsor logos.  The helmets are sometimes custom made if the team/manufacturer has the money, otherwise they are off-the-shelf pieces from companies like Bell.  What else do you want to know?"

formula1,3dgln7,MS308-91,1 point,Thu Jul 16 03:41:41 2015 UTC,"I do not have a technical answer for you. However to my knowledge, the equipment varies from team to team. All members of the teams wear a uniform similar to the drivers' racing suit, the pit crew also wear helmets, gloves, and shoes. The support crew ( I am assuming you as asking about Engineer and the few others who sit trackside and monitor the cars telemetry ) wear similar attire but a more professional looking shirt, pants, shoes.   For the equipment check out this pit walk it will give you a pretty thorough glimpse into the garages of the teams on a race weekend.    Take some time to look at all the subtle and not so subtle differences in the cars, and their unique: front wings, side pod, rear wings, etc. This is an incredibly technical sport in which teams engineer and design their own cars from the ground up based on the engineers' interpretation of the rules. Mercedes and Ferrari are the only 2 constructors who also construct their own engines. Other teams will purchase their engineers from another manufacturer. McLaren, Red Bull, and Scuderia Toro Roso all purchase engines from suppliers not involved in F1 any more (Honda, Renault). While Sahara Force India, Lotus F1, and Williams, all purchase engines from Mercedes. Leaving Manor Marussia and Sauber purchasing from Ferrari.   So as far tools and equipment teams use they vary vastly. The equipment use for pit stops is all designed for speed and efficiency. However only in the hands of an extremely well orchestrated pit crew who are perfectly in sync with one an other are they able to pull off these incredibly quick 2-3 second stops."

formula1,3ddmny,mathdhruv,3,Wed Jul 15 18:12:13 2015 UTC,"Id say many began to question just how good he was back in 2007 actually. Ferrari had replaced Schumacher with Raikkonen and expected him to be the clearly ahead on Massa on raw talent as Michael had been, but that simply wasnt the case. Overall Massa matched him throughout their 2.5 years together and Ferrari's lack of that raw talent like Schumacher cost them the 2008 title when they had the fastest car. 2010 comes and they buy Raikkonen out of his contract and replace him with Alonso - hoping he would fill the ""Schumacher roll"" and dominate against the proven benchmark of Massa and that's exactly what he did for his 4 years against him.   Moreover, during his comeback in 2012 he was instantly put into a quick, race winning car against a mistake prone rookie. Once Grosjean had settled into the sport he was outperforming Raikkonen in the second half of 2013. I dont see his driving any different in 2014 or 2015, its just that he's been placed against ultra competitive teammates for the first time in his career and his come off a clear second best."
formula1,3ddmny,theantijokef1,8,Wed Jul 15 14:28:04 2015 UTC,"Well, one must also remember that 2007 was Kimi's first season on the Bridgestones. Much like Alonso (who also made a similar switch), he struggled through the first half. However, he won 6 races, 2 more than anyone else.  Another factor to keep in mind is that over 2007-08 (and indeed, later), Ferrari developed the suspension in their cars to favour a more understeer-oriented driving style, such as the one employed by Felipe, and later Fernando. This was against Kimi's philosophy, who always went for sharp turn-in, preferring a more over-steery car than Schumacher himself. It also meant that he was unable to get the heat into the tyres when required, leading to poor qualifying performance. Once you start down the field, it is harder to win races, especially in the pre-DRS, crazy winglet aero era.  His race pace was still very good, as evidenced by the high no. of fastest laps. It just took him too long to get heat into the tyres in the first place.  Also, let's not forget his excellent performance in the second half of 2009, where he was the second highest point scorer (after Hamilton) by a single point, in the shitbox Ferrari. This was also after Ferrari tweaked the suspension to his likings, once Felipe had his accident.  In his comeback, I always felt he was missing a little something, since the flashes of amazing pace mid-race had vanished, to accompany the earlier loss in quali form.   its just that he's been placed against ultra competitive teammates for the first time in his career   I disagree. JPM was a top-class driver. I wish he'd stuck around so we could have seen him go against Hamilton, Vettel and the rest. He's comfortably leading the Indycar championship this year, at 39 years of age. Juan Pablo Montoya was (& still is) ultra-competitive, even if he wasn't on his best form in 2005-06."
formula1,3ddmny,mathdhruv,-2,Wed Jul 15 14:46:34 2015 UTC,"Well, one must also remember that 2007 was Kimi's first season on the Bridgestones. Much like Alonso (who also made a similar switch), he struggled through the first half. However, he won 6 races, 2 more than anyone else.   The Ferrari was clearly the best car in 2007 and yet Raikkonen only won the title by one point. Had either Hamilton or Alonso not had eachother as a teammate they could have easily won but they were constantly taking points off eachother. The Bridgestones were a completely new compound from previous years so no team/driver who had previously been using their tires in previous years would gain an advantage.    Another factor to keep in mind is that over 2007-08 (and indeed, later), Ferrari developed the suspension in their cars to favour a more understeer-oriented driving style, such as the one employed by Felipe, and later Fernando.    Yeah i'll need a source on that thanks. The 2007 Ferrari would have been developed using the same principles as the previous Ferrari's. Considering Schumacher and Raikkonen both prefered to have a pointy front end I see no reason why the 2007 car would suddenly have an understeer-orientated front end considering Raikkonen was brought in to do exactly what Michael was doing!   His race pace was still very good, as evidenced by the high no. of fastest laps. It just took him too long to get heat into the tyres in the first place.   I find it remarkable how the only fanbase that cares about fastest laps is Raikkonen's. Literally no other fan base could give a shit about it and its not a great indicator of driver performance - just shows that they were on low fuel with clean tires on a clear track.    JPM was a top-class driver.   There's very few sane F1 experts that would place JPM in the same category of driver as Alonso or Vettel."
formula1,3ddmny,theantijokef1,5,Wed Jul 15 15:15:46 2015 UTC,"clearly the best car in 2007   Citation needed. Also, let's not pretend that the 760 page operation manual to the F2007 that McLaren had didn't help them at all.   The Bridgestones were a completely new compound   Yes, but they were not a different style of construction. The Michelins used a very different construction philosophy to the Bridgestones, and thus, behaved very differently.   The 2007 Ferrari would have been developed using the same principles as the previous Ferrari's.   It was...initially. However, as the season went on, there were statements by Ferrari mentioning the suspension changes, and how they were a major factor in Felipe's improvement in performance.   I find it remarkable how the only fanbase that cares about fastest laps is Raikkonen's. Literally no other fan base could give a shit about it and its not a great indicator of driver performance - just shows that they were on low fuel with clean tires on a clear track.   Except I'm not part of his fanbase. I never particularly liked him, and am mostly indifferent to him. However, you can't deny that setting fastest lap is a measurable factor, since most of the times, teams converged on exactly the same fuel strategies, give or take a lap. In the refuelling era, the fastest lap was an accurate measure of whether people were pushing to the limit in a certain phase of the race, since it was usually set around the time a pitstop was due, and gaps needed to be pulled/maintained.   There's very few sane F1 experts that would place JPM in the same category of driver as Alonso or Vettel.   Well then call me insane, because I think JPM was the same class as Vettel, (who I rate as slightly below Alonso) and just never got the machinery to show it in the same way. People forget how dominant the Schumacher-Ferrari combination was during the years that JPM was in the sport. We must remember that Vettel is 28, while Kimi is 35. Surely that's a factor in why Vettel is winning... IMO, Alonso's domination of Raikkonen, which was much more comprehensive than Vettel's (so far) tells us a good deal about the relative level of Alonso and Vettel."
formula1,3ddmny,mathdhruv,-4,Wed Jul 15 15:29:00 2015 UTC,"Citation needed. Also, let's not pretend that the 760 page operation manual to the F2007 that McLaren had didn't help them at all.   Never said it didnt but why on earth would they copy a design that's worse than theirs? Ferrari won the championship with inferior drivers to McLaren, that should be proof enough that the Ferrari was the quicker car.    Yes, but they were not a different style of construction. The Michelins used a very different construction philosophy to the Bridgestones, and thus, behaved very differently.   They were actually. Once Bridgestone became the sole tire manufacturer it had to ensure that all teams start on a level playing field. They developed completely new tires for the 2007 season to ensure just this.    It was...initially. However, as the season went on, there were statements by Ferrari mentioning the suspension changes, and how they were a major factor in Felipe's improvement in performance.   Again Ill need a source on that, preferably links to the statement and who said it.    However, you can't deny that setting fastest lap is a measurable factor   Fastest laps are as good a measure of how good one driver is relative to another as the total amount of poles, wins, or podiums theyve got. Its largely based on car performance. Considering Raikkonen was driving the fastest/second fastest car for a majority of 2003-2008 its not at all surprising that he's got a very high number of fastest laps.   JPM was the same class as Vettel   Burst out laughing. Funniest thing Ive read all week."

formula1,3ddmny,Ronypeg,5,Wed Jul 15 16:06:51 2015 UTC,He is absolutely the real deal. But he's too big and he doesn't have huge personal sponsorship. That he's managed to get as far as he has is testament to just how good he is. I really want to see him in a competitive car before the end of his F1 career.
formula1,3ddmny,iluvatar,3,Wed Jul 15 17:43:11 2015 UTC,"I also always just thought him being German is probably a disadvantage in terms of getting personal sponsorship. He had the in with Willi Weber at first but then just never got anything again.   With the big competition with other Germans Sutil, Rosberg, Schumacher, Vettel, Heidfeld at the time. Companies were just spoiled for choice and you'd always pick the mega star Schumacher and upcoming star Vettel over the others. Now Rosberg and Vettel are the two Germans who have the lead with this.  Always surprised me though how many personal sponsors Sutil actually had."

I'd be amazed if the engineers had any cross-communication with Honda's F1 engine engineers in Japan. Even the respective management of each division probably don't communicate, nevermind the engineers.  Someone from Mercedes F1 mentioned in a TV interview this year that their engine guys in the UK do have communication with the non-F1 engine guys in Stuttgart and that they will bounce ideas and problems off them to see if their experience can help on various things that come up."

I always loved the shriek, the volume, the visceral noise the cars used to make.  When the cars drove past on full acceleration it physically hurt to listen without protection, it was not PC and it was like that in an age where everything else was, it was a little bit like why people like Jeremy Clarkson.  The new noise is great for family's and a lot of other reasons, but it's just not the F1 that I want it to be.  Edit: change can to can't."

formula1,3dh7jp,Mrfdbirrell,7,Thu Jul 16 06:32:13 2015 UTC,"I've said it before and I'll say it again: The sound of the V8/10/12 used 2 more of the 5 senses to convince the viewer that it was the pinnacle of motorsports. The nearly 20000 screaming RPMs convinced your ears that there was nothing faster. The sound traveling through your body convinced your heart that they were using all of what they had. You can only use vision to be convinced why it is the pinnacle with the current engines.  I'm a huge aviation fan. When I go to an airshow, sure the Mustangs and Spitfires are beautiful to watch fly. They have a certain grace to them. They sound good in their own way, but they are not very loud. However, when the modern fighter jets fly (usually F-16's and F/A-18's here in the US) they might be going the same speed for a particular maneuver as the Mustangs and Spitfires, but the sound literally travels through your body, it takes up all of your hearing, blocks out everything else, and reminds you of the insane power and capability that those planes have. That is the difference between a V6 at ~10000 rpm and a V10 at ~20000 rpm."
formula1,3dh7jp,SE94,5,Thu Jul 16 08:46:42 2015 UTC,"Having been to races during the V8 era I can confirm this is the case. You could feel and hear that the cars were fast and powerful. Now all you have is the visual and with the cars being slower than in the V8 era it all adds up to being slightly unimpressive, and that just isn't Formula 1 to me. Watching some old 2010 races recently confirmed this in my mind. 2017 can't come soon enough."

There are far bigger things to fix than the sound of the engines in this sport."
formula1,3dh7jp,JordanF1,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:57:46 2015 UTC,No one is saying it is the biggest issue in the sport. We're purely talking about the sound and what it has taken away from the sport. Whether you saw a great race or not doesn't make the sound any better to worse. It's a constant and that constant used to bring a great pleasure to many and without it the sport is less than what it used to be. How much less is up to the individual.
formula1,3dh7jp,Deathbynote,0,Thu Jul 16 19:00:33 2015 UTC,You skipped the point. I went to a race and didn't think about the sound once.

I do agree though, I do like the cars' sound now, especially since they're quieter. Means we can hear stuff like the turbo, which is really exciting to me, and if the engines were louder the chances of hearing the turbos would be close to zero. Logically I also enjoy the fact that they are quiet because I know there is immense turbine harvesting happening, dampening the exhaust volume."

They have a bit more scream to them, especially when you hear them in person. I don't miss the V8s honestly. To me they were just high pitched engine notes. But the V10s and especially the V12s were like synphonies of explosions. The last thing I want to say to people is to not trust what you hear on the broadcast. These engines, more so than any other engine formula I've lived through, sound much better in person. On TV they sound bland but IMO in person they have a very rich and interesting sound that I really enjoy. They're not as loud as the older NA engines, but if they were then you couldn't hear that sweet turbo noise :D"

Maybe if we end up with higher fuel flows and consequently higher RPMs they will stand out and the noise will become less of a problem. I visited Silverstone this year. I like the noise. The Honda sounds grim, not smooth and like it is fighting itself to keep turning. But the other cars make a good sound. I actually kind of liked not having to wear ear protection. I could hear the reactions from the crowds around me and there was a nice atmosphere. I think you lose some of that when you're trapped inside some ear defenders."

formula1,3ddjjv,pies1123,12,Wed Jul 15 12:57:32 2015 UTC,"My issue is with development speed. In F1 you develop quickly or falter. I just don't think Honda can develop quickly enough. By the time they perfect this engine, the regs would have changed, and we would be back to square 1.   Honda has a very structured, relentless, low risk approach that works great for reliable, bulletproof, road cars. But with cutting edge tech? that approach simply won't work when the rate of development is so high. Low risk means low return  I think they have done well in MotoGP because none of the engine tech there is particularly new. It is at the end of the day a naturally aspirated high revving 4-pot. It has been around since the 1900s.   Honda is struggling with the energy recovery the most, and unless they change their approach, I don't have much optimism"

While I dont claim to know anything about their inside plans, the general opinion on F1technical.com seems to be that Scarbs was wrong and the axial turbo isn't being used, because ""nobody could be that stupid."" Then again axial turbos have alot of drivability issues, especially when handicapped by the current regs, so maybe Honda was actually that ""stupid"" since drivability is a big issue with them now."
formula1,3ddjjv,FAFASGR,3,Wed Jul 15 15:32:32 2015 UTC,The only way for their engine to make sense is axial turbo to be there and pictures of the real designs have leaked. If they scrapped the axial turbo they'd have to redesign the whole engine.

For starters Mclaren had the f-duct before anyone else, so that helped. I can remember Hamilton capitalising on Webber overtaking another car and ending up passing both of them in Melbourne.

He's old now, and with age your physical ability will go down. It varies by lifestyle choices. Some will still be in their prime when they are 35 years old if they've kept good care of themselves, such as Alonso. Räikkönen is not slow, or a bad driver, or unmotivated. He's old and it will happen to everyone eventually. I don't think the hate against his skills or person are fair. He's one of the best drivers of my own lifetime. He's past his racing prime, but the real reason is age. We shouldn't be yelling at the drivers for not finding a fountain of youth. If you think someone younger should be driving the Ferrari, the hate should be directed at those who make the decisions. You can't expect Räikkönen to refuse a Ferrari spot when he still wants to drive."

I think there is every possibility Schumacher would have won at Monaco, he would have almost certainly been on the podium in China, Australia would have been a high points finish, Canada the wing got stuck open, so many others races.

The 2012 Lotus was probably all things considered the second best car that year, many people criticized it for being poor in qualifying but that was very likely the drivers underperforming and it often had among the best if not the outright best race pace on the grid.  I just cannot believe that Kimi who has looked absolutely lost in qualifying the last 2 years and even wasn't that fast over one lap in his first stint (lost 14-21 to Massa in qualifying) was suddenly qualifying well in 2012. The sad bit is Grosjean was generally even worse over one lap."

Ni matter what that says about his adaptability and overall performance as a driver, linear team mate comparisons don't work 100% of the time.

formula1,3dcfxc,theantijokef1,9,Wed Jul 15 04:57:18 2015 UTC,To be fair to Grosjean he was essentially a rookie when Kimi went against him - highly mistake prone as well.

formula1,3dcfxc,Jones3619,9,Wed Jul 15 12:50:55 2015 UTC,"No we dont have to reassess it. Kimi was able to perform in the V8 and V10 era, hell, he won the 2007 WDC and was close in 2003 and 2005, and got 3rd in 2012 and 2008. Its in the V6T era (2014 to now) he has begun to fuck things up. He got a clear driving style he either cant or dont want to change, and that style suited the V10 and V8 cars perfectly, but this era of cars it simply doesnt."
formula1,3dcfxc,theantijokef1,6,Wed Jul 15 08:14:33 2015 UTC,"this is a good assessment. Kimi has a style where he carries more speed into the corner on entry than most drivers. that was ideal to the high downforce days and with the lower torque of those engines he didnt have to worry about his throttle application as much. Now the cars dont have the downforce so its harder to drive the way he likes and the front is much more sensitive which we all know is Kimi's achilles heel. Add in the high torque of the V6T and he is having issues with that as well. I dont think Kimi is slow, actually i think he can still be one of the fastest if he gets the car he likes. Unfortunately you cant keep waiting until he gets that. you either put up the results with what you have or get replaced if someone can do better."
formula1,3dcfxc,CookieMan0,-2,Wed Jul 15 09:16:58 2015 UTC,"It didn't suit it ""perfectly"" he never beat a really high quality team mate and he was generally outperformed by Felipe Massa. He was a good, not great, but good driver back in the pre turbo era and now he is a below average driver  the excuse of he sometimes matches Vettel on pace isn't a glowing review because who knows how well Vettel is doing. He certainly didn't look that fast before being paired with Raikkonen unless he has improved drastically in the off season."

He has only ever been a legitimate title contender when driving the outright fastest car on the grid (2005 McLaren, 2007 Ferrari).   Even when having the fastest car again in 2008, he got his tail spanked by his teammate - who has always been regarded as a ""second tier"" driver.  He was beaten by Massa over the course of their time at Ferrari, and beaten quite badly post-2007. And Massa is the same guy let go by Ferrari for not being up to the caliber of Alonso/Vettel/Hamilton, so I don't know why anyone has expected Kimi to do anything more than be slightly worse than Massa.   Kimi these days is performing moderately worse than Massa, which seems about right. Against top-flight teammates (Alonso & Vettel) he will almost never finish ahead, he is simply not a top-caliber driver.   Even Ferrari themselves seem to have bought into the myth that Kimi can hold his own with the best on the grid but it seems that the jig is just about up. He was lucky to be in the right place in the right time in 2007."

Then a hilariously huge gap before Rosberg and Nakajima appear, who had only managed to break out of the train a few laps prior.

Came back in 2009. BBC iplayer started showing all the races that year and the phoenix fairytale of Brawn and the chance for Rubens to fight for a championship hooked me back in and not looked back since.

If Bottas ends up at Ferrari it's because Ferrari gave Williams a nice pay cheque  Or teams can buy out driver contacts. Ferrari gave Kimi a lot of money not to drive for them despite him having a contact.   The Red Bull young driver contacts probably allow them to put the kids wherever they want.

formula1,3dcxqn,shamelesscreature,7,Wed Jul 15 18:40:28 2015 UTC,Why were grooved tires introduced/used some years ago? What was its benefit? What was the intention?  Edit: grammar
formula1,3dcxqn,Frothyleet,22,Wed Jul 15 19:50:05 2015 UTC,They were supposed to reduce cornering speeds (smaller contact patch between the tyre and the road) without reducing drag (same outer dimensions as slicks). That worked as intended.
formula1,3dcxqn,ceribus_peribus,10,Thu Jul 16 16:52:41 2015 UTC,"And to elaborate on why that was desirable, it was primarily a question of safety. With the aero developments of that era, the top F1 teams were able to get around tracks insanely quickly, because their massive aero grip allowed them to get through corners with such great speed. The problem is that if there is contact or a car failure during a cornering situation, the faster you were initially taking the corner, the more dangerous the potential impact if you went off. So the FIA figured that by reducing mechanical grip, they could slow the cars down some and increase safety.   Since that time there have been reformulations that leave us with cars with much less aero grip, and many circuits have seen minor revisions to create more runoff in the most dangerous corners, so there is no point to reducing mechanical grip with grooved tires (plus, changing the balance of F1 grip towards mechanical and away from aero encourages overtaking - mechanical grip is not hindered in corners from being close behind another car like aero grip is)."

formula1,3dcxqn,Sghal,22,Thu Jul 16 19:45:07 2015 UTC,You still need good aerodynamics to make the car stick to the ground. And drivers to make the most of the engine.

formula1,3dcxqn,RK79,7,Wed Jul 15 22:33:24 2015 UTC,How do teams like Force India develop their car when teams with a much bigger budget like McLaren seem to be standing still?
formula1,3dcxqn,obillion,7,Thu Jul 16 00:02:37 2015 UTC,"You have to acknowledge the time it takes to develop the cars and the need for actual running not dyno and simulation stuff.   This formula was agreed to at the turn of the decade (those with the exact dates will correct). So the engine constructors agreed to the PU and direction of development. They then had time to develop their entries for 2014. In 2014 they got to race but more importantly to refine their entries. Ferrari, Renault, and Mercedes have had the time both before the introduction of the formula and actual running to develop. Honda is only really having the running experience now and they seem to have taken a somewhat different approach to the formula so they have to deal with the teething there.   You also have to consider that FI is a customer team and different from a works team like mclaren. So while it is not as simplified as I am about to make it, FI has a great PU and their part is to develop the aero and incorporate the PU into the package. Mclaren and honda have to fine tune and work out the kinks in the the PU and the aero at the same time without the benefit of a year of actual running.  honda entered late and decided to take a different approach to the formula and is suffering from that because they are in effect a year behind everyone else. FI is a customer team so while not having the burden of engine development has had a year to refine their aero and packaging approach. However all is not lost. Ferrari on 2015 has shown to some extent that gains can be made and it could be argued that there will be diminishing returns soon enough and everyone will get close enough to Mercedes to threaten for podiums."
formula1,3dcxqn,endymion_frs,3,Wed Jul 15 09:54:36 2015 UTC,"Thank you, I understand that.

formula1,3dcxqn,RK79,3,Thu Jul 16 02:35:25 2015 UTC,This I'm not sure of. I remember a tin foilish sounding theory on this sub that the 2014 mclaren may have been beta testing for honda with the double wishbone. However on a more grounded level budgets while indicative of what can be thrown at development do not equate to actual results. Ferrari and mclaren had huge budgets but red bull had an ingenious approach to their car during the years of their dominance. Sometimes the amount of money had and human resources does not equate to that great idea. It could just be safe to say mclaren is in a slump which is being further accentuated by the honda troubles.

formula1,3dcxqn,RK79,2,Wed Jul 15 11:30:46 2015 UTC,"It's hard to get a measure on how much McLaren are improving though, given the issues with the Honda PUs."
formula1,3dcxqn,mathdhruv,2,Wed Jul 15 11:32:30 2015 UTC,"That's because most of McLaren's woes come down to the power unit, and running a weak and under-optimized power unit causes them to compromize on their aero set-up as well. Even if they could generate bundles of extra downforce by running the ideal aero set-up, the engine power deficit would mean that (due to the extra drag also added), they'd lose shitloads of time when running full throttle down straights.  So the engine (which is, at this point in time, shit) also causes them to run a non-optimal aero configuration, which in turn also loses them time in corners and may lead to increased tyre wear."
formula1,3dcxqn,skgoa,1 point,Wed Jul 15 11:31:36 2015 UTC,"I agree with of all that and you are correct, but McLaren have deeper problems for me, last year they had a good PU yet they were all over the place. I have hopes, but I don't see much improvements next season either."

When there is a collision in a chicane, how does FIA determine who is responsible? Or do both drivers get a warning/penalty? Does a race ever get stopped because of rain? If so, how do they decide? I was watching Canada 2011 as a lot of people on here say it's one of the best races.  There was a re-start in the race.  Can someone please explain why? Why do drivers change so often? So many changed from 2011 to 2014 to 2015. What's the main reason? Just poor performance?   Thanks!"
formula1,3dcxqn,Spark_77,7,Wed Jul 15 14:00:20 2015 UTC,Cutting costs and F1 wanted to go hybrid like other classes. Basic rule is the driver that attemps the overtake is responsible to execute it safely. The overtaking car has to be at least along side to have the right to take the line into the chicane. I hope this explains it a little bit. Yes that has happened in the past. They decide with the drivers if its safe to still race. Because they found it safe to race again. after this race tho F1 made a rule that a race session cant be longer than 6 hours from light out till checkerd ( including red flags etc.) the maximum race time is 2 hours ( without stoppages ) Alot of it is down to performance but also to do with money alot of the midfield/backmarker teams struggle for money so they pick drivers who bring alot of sponsor money with them   I hope this awnsers your questions if you still have questions feel free to ask.   Also feel free to correct me if im wrong.

formula1,3dcxqn,Spark_77,6,Thu Jul 16 06:20:46 2015 UTC,"All from memory, but the normal procedure for poor weather is that the safety car will be out, the cars then have to follow, in race order. This is in the hope that the weather will soon clear, the safety car can leave the track and the race resume.  In the case of this race the weather continued to worsen, with no sign of improvement the race was suspended (red flagged). This is then the cars lined up on the grid. It took several hours for the weather to improve to the point that the race could be resumed. This was the first time that such a long delay had happened - race suspensions (red flags) are quite rare, let alone a suspension lasting that long.  After that race the FIA edited the rules to prevent it happening again - now the race will be declared over if it hasn't been completed 4 hours after it starts."

formula1,3dcxqn,Frothyleet,3,Wed Jul 15 16:13:43 2015 UTC,"1) The engine manufacturers are in F1 to show how technically advanced they are, in a bid to sell road cars. They also use F1 as a research & development arena to come up with new technology. With the road car industry inching ever closer to widescale adoption of hybrid drivetrains its only natural that the manufacturers wanted to use F1 to develop their hybrid systems, turbos are also very common in road cars now. The old 2.4 V8s didn't let the manufacturers work on hybrid systems and weren't really relevant to road cars. They needed F1 to be more relevant.  There was (still is) a sentiment within F1 that it should be seen to be at the cutting edge of technology.  5) Drivers are usually signed for a defined period of time (e.g. 2 years). Quite often nowadays there is a mutual option to extend the contract, often called a 2+1 (2 years and an option on a third year). From the teams perspective they may not want to re-sign a driver if his performance hasn't been good enough or if his wage demands are too high. Sometimes teams may sign sponsorship deals that mean they have to sign a particular driver, in which case the current driver is no longer required.  From the driver point of view if the team can't build a quick car that can bring wins, championships they may leave in order to get a drive at another team who have a better car."

The car leading into the turn on the racing line generally has ""right of way"" but can be challenged by a faster driver Races will be cancelled due to rain if too much water collects on the track, which would cause the car to hydroplane  Didn't see that race, I'm a new fan :) Drivers are like any other athlete with contracts.

I have never heard safety advanced as one of the reasons for the move to the new engine formula. The primary reason always has seemed to be road relevance - the engine manufacturers want their R&D on top-end engines to trickle down to road cars, and much more is applicable when you are talking about maximizing efficiency and utilizing hybridization of smaller engines - more and more modern road cars are going towards smaller turbo engines, even sportier cars."

formula1,3dcxqn,mathdhruv,20,Thu Jul 16 06:48:04 2015 UTC,Impossible as the combustion engine needs air to work. Aerodynamics won't matter at all due to the absence of air. Radiator cooling system will be modified to those found in space. Radiator panels have to be perpendicular to the Sun to dissipate heat from the car.  Drivers have to wear a space suit for their bodies and the ambient pressure to reach equilibrium. Oxygen tanks have to be installed.  This is pretty much explained in layman's terms.
formula1,3dcxqn,TheWotsit,4,Thu Jul 16 07:41:38 2015 UTC,"The cars wouldn't get off the line as the engine needs oxygen to combust the fuel. If you solved this, the cars would still run into problems very quick as they are air cooled.   Ignoring all this though they would be a lot slower in the corners, as they would loose all downforce, but much quicker on the straights, as there would be no drag.   You would need a computer to drive the car though as the drivers would have... problems.  Edit: Removed my ""naturally aspirated"" bs"
formula1,3dcxqn,mathdhruv,9,Fri Jul 17 16:51:36 2015 UTC,"as they are naturally aspirated   Actually, natural aspiration is a term coined for engines. It means that the air reaching the engine (to allow fuel combustion) is going in at atmospheric pressure, and not at a higher pressure.

Not trying to sound stupid but what is the M838T if not a McLaren engine? I mean, I knew that they've used Mercedes engines for a very long time in road and racing cars, but I thought they started producing their own V8's with the MP4-12C?  Anyway, part of it also might have to do with the inherent value of being a PU-constructor. Brands like Mercedes, Renault, Honda all stand to gain a great deal through development of turbocharged V6's since there's a push to make smaller displacement / fewer cylinders engines for their road cars. McLaren (and to a certain extent, Ferrari too I guess) haven't yet reached the point where turbo V6's can help their road car enterprise."
formula1,3dcxqn,xXReddiTpRoXx,2,Wed Jul 15 22:17:40 2015 UTC,"The M838T's story is a bit of a complicated one. It was designed by Tom Walkinshaw Racing, a British racing team best known for their collaborations with Jaguar in Group C. This engine was planned for use in Indycars but McLaren bought the rights to it before it raced. It was then developed further for road use by McLaren in collaboration with the engineering company Ricardo (no relation) and using technology bought from Menard Competition Technologies who are involved in the making of many race engines. So in summary while McLaren didn't single handedly design the M838T in house, they did play a major role in its development, they do have the right to brand it as a McLaren engine, and if it wern't for McLaren's involvement it would still be a distantly related unused Indycar engine."

All I could find is this piece of news from 2011 which says Renault was against the rule but implies that even Renault supported some kind of limited development system (sounds like the current token system).  I didn't follow F1 much between 2004 and this year so I don't remember much about recent history, but AFAIK there was another engine freeze starting from something like 2006 or 2009 until 2013.

formula1,3dcxqn,skgoa,2,Wed Jul 15 23:39:50 2015 UTC,"I saw a post here about ground force making a return in 2017. I also hear wider tyres may make a come back(and less downforce) increasing mechanical grip at higher speed behind a car. There for making it easier too overtake. Is this true? And if so, would this mean we could see nicer looking cars like those of the late 80s? Or is all this just speculation?"
formula1,3dcxqn,redbull9134,4,Thu Jul 16 00:16:41 2015 UTC,"yes it's true,  as for nicer looking that's entirely subjective.  However you wont see cars looking anything like they did in the 80's.  The rear wing will never be low again (makes it a bitch for cars behind) and the front wings will still be multi-element."
formula1,3dcxqn,rr2999,3,Thu Jul 16 00:22:23 2015 UTC,"""Ground force"" (you meant ground effect, strictly speaking ground force is gravity), is downforce generated by the floor. It is the biggest portion of downforce generated by current F1 cars already. The change that is in the works might shift the balance between floor and wings a bit back towards the extreme ""floor"" end of the sliding scale. For the last 30 years the trend has been in the other direction. The chief advantage is that the floor doesn't generate much drag, while the wings do, so it's ""cheaper"". And since the floor isn't nearly as intricate as front wings are, cars with a high reliance on ground effect tend to not suffer as much a loss in downforce when following closely behind another car.   I hate the term ""mechanical grip"" because it leads to exactly this kind of misunderstanding as you showed in your post... ""Mechanical"" grip's influence on cornering ability of the tyres tends to vanish with increasing speed. Roughly from 100mph onwards aerodynamic downforce starts to dominate. That would be a medium speed corner in F1. You can not simply exchange downforce and ""mechanical"" grip. You can't get significantly better cornering ability at high speed from slightly wider tyres. Physics says no. (Also, following another car hurts front grip much more than rear, how are wider rear tyres going to help?) These tyres will be better at dealing with the high torque the current engines put out, though, which should enable drivers to lean on them a little more.  All of this should indeed make overtaking easier. However we won't see many drawn-out fight as long as the tyres stay this soft while refueling stays banned, because drivers can't risk taking too much life out of their tyres. Will these cars look nicer? Honestly I am cynical about that: they will look bad at first but a couple of years later we will remember them as iconic. Just as it always is. And yeah, currently it's all jsut speculation."

formula1,3dcxqn,Frothyleet,2,Thu Jul 16 01:16:43 2015 UTC,why does the break need to warm up so it works at capacity? I thought high temperature brings break fade.
formula1,3dcxqn,AlonsoFerrari8,1 point,Thu Jul 16 02:39:55 2015 UTC,"The amount of kinetic energy that a F1 car needs to turn into heat (i.e., mechanical braking) over a single lap is enormous. When a F1 car, as light as they are, needs to go from 200+ MPH to 40 MPH in the course of maybe 150m (such as at Canada or Montreal), that kinetic energy has to go somewhere. It's getting turned into heat (and, well, partially into electric energy in a battery with modern ERS).  This means that a F1 car uses carbon brake discs quite unlike the steel ones your road car almost certainly uses; a steel disc, even with excellent cooling, simply couldn't handle the amount of heat that the brakes must generate. At peak the carbon discs exceed 1000C degrees. The design tradeoff is basically that these unique carbon brake discs won't work effectively except within a certain temperature range (which is true of steel brakes too, it's just that the temperature range of a traditional steel brake disc in a road car starts at room temp!).  It's still quite possible to overheat these brakes, though, and experience fading performance. Managing brake temperatures in both directions is quite important for drivers."

He doesn't drink,  trains constantly and changes his weight depending on what is needed for the car.  He also has the mentality to work on his own style and his own goals.  He doesn't worry how x manages the car or y,  he worries about how he manages the car.  Finally,  which was very apparent in Monaco last year,   when it comes to the race he never looks behind him only ahead.  Monaco last year ( I think, someone feel free to correct me),  he was stuck in third for a while and finally freed himself up to catch for the win,  he had no chance but it was his first question when he got freed up.

How dare you! ;)  Pics of Powertrain  The cars have looked very similiar for the past 3 years, especially suspension, but powertrain and drivetrain have changed quite significantly over the years.  Sadly, the situation is that Team HARE will probably not exist in the same way as we currently know it. In September we had signed onto the team 17 BEng students, 10 MEng and 2 faculty advisors who were former students to guide us. The team is dependent on the BEng to have their research dissertations drive the design for next year's car and to learn how to develop the car, but none of the students involved were actually interested in getting involved with the team. We often went weeks or months between seeing BEng students during stages we would have really needed their help. (Statics especially)  Currently now, there are 8 MEng students and the 2 faculty advisers left and we are all leaving this year including the advisers, which means there will be no continuity and no students who will understand how to design, build or prepare a car for a competition. And after putting so many hours into this year I just find it emotionally tragic.   So I'd rather share what we've developed rather to develop interest into formula student as a whole rather than keeping it locked behind closed doors."

formula1,3d8rga,vovin,2,Tue Jul 14 21:18:29 2015 UTC,"/u/Crippled_Potato, you may be thinking of a possible reduction in maximum power from 60kW to 40kW at FSUK, the rest of the world is sticking with 80kW maximum. Maximum voltage is 300V at FSAE-Michigan and FSAE-Lincoln, rest of the world competition's are 600V. The rest of the world is sticking with 80kW because in other competitions, EV teams need that 80kW to produce similar torque to the combustion cars.   It is the specific torque of the motors (Nm/input kW) plus the maximum RPM that is the real benefit on an EV powertrain. Even if they keep bringing down the maximum power, the teams will just get companies to help research and develop in higher specific torque motors, as well as using more exotic internal materials to increase maximum motor speed above 20k RPM to achieve higher reduction ratios. I do also get that yes, power and torque are related, but the restriction method of maximum battery power draw doesn't necessarily reduce the force at the wheelprint like with an air restrictor on a combustion car.   /u/Camberrrr, Zurich is not playing with that much money I can assure you, maybe €200k-250k overall with most in in-kind support from companies, but they receive relatively little of their budget in cash. Yes, it is a shiteload of cash, but it is bloody easy to piss it away without benefit, all of those guys working on those teams work bloody hard to get the most out of the resources they have.  I'm from QUT in Australia, but I've done a year with GreenTeam in Stuttgart, their budget was similar to Zurich's as was they type of support they got from companies."

Never said they didn't work hard, it's just MUCH easier when you don't build a lot of the car yourself, and you have such incredible support from large companies and a lot of academics.  Most UK teams are literally just the students and the technician with maybe one medium sponsor such as MAHLE, which IMHO is how the competition should be.  It's a competition to demonstrate how good the students are, not who can essentially make FSAE into Formula1."

formula1,3df5kg,Gugg256,7,Wed Jul 15 20:01:30 2015 UTC,"There's actually some really interesting statistical analysis on this question. You should read it over here.  To quote the relevant section: ""team performances account for 61% of the variance in overall performances, while driver performances account for 39%."" So car design and support constitute a majority of what's at stake but there's still a significant portion left up to the driver. From eyeballing the list the difference between a good driver and an okay driver (for instance, Hamilton versus Kovaleinen) comes out to something like half a second a lap."
formula1,3df5kg,RobGlass,3,Wed Jul 15 22:13:30 2015 UTC,"The cars are by far the biggest performance differentiator in F1. Great drivers will get the more out of the same car than average drivers, but in the end the car is the limiting factor. You can look at the team mate battles to see how big of a difference a driver makes. F1 is a constructor series, which means that every team builds their own cars, and the cars can differ quite a lot in performance because of that. The Mercedes works car is usually faster in the corners than any other car on the grid, because it has lots of downforce, a sophisticated suspension, etc. A driver cannot compensate for that. The Renault- and Honda-powered cars have less horsepower and are thus slower on the straights than the Mercedes- and Ferrari-powered ones. A driver cannot compensate for that. A great driver might find a better setup, make fewer mistakes, be better in on track battles and keep faster cars behind - he generally gets closer to the limit of what the car is capable of. That can make a big difference in some situations. If one car is slightly slower than another a great driver can defeat a mediocre driver in the slightly faster car. But if the performance gap between two cars is quite big - like with Mercedes and the rest - even the greatest driver cannot overcome that difference unless Mercedes make a big mistake. And no-one has a better driver line-up than Mercedes, anyway."
formula1,3df5kg,Moctecus,2,Wed Jul 15 20:29:17 2015 UTC,Fernando Alonso is arguably the best driver in F1 (you will find very few people who say he isn't at least one of the best) and he is still in the backfield with the McHonda.
formula1,3df5kg,FullFrontalNoodly,4,Thu Jul 16 00:05:27 2015 UTC,"As a general rule, I would say: 95% of race time is determined by the car/engine, 5% by the driver."

formula1,3detg8,I_Tell_Penis_jokes,4,Wed Jul 15 18:38:55 2015 UTC,I think you can say that this has happened all throughout F1's history. Williams had a strong era of dominance in the early to mid 1990s and Mclaren before that in the late 1980s. Interestingly even before that there was an extremely dominant constructor in F1... Cosworth.
formula1,3detg8,Laradu,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:44:26 2015 UTC,"The thing is... if you look at every other year where one team was said to have dominated, it was still more competitive than this season.  Even the famous 1988 season where McLaren won all but one race still had 10 different drivers on the podium. This year it's only 6."
formula1,3detg8,jigielnik,2,Wed Jul 15 20:12:00 2015 UTC,"This year it's only 6.    We're half way through the season. That number could easily reach 7, 8 or 9 by the end."

Also, 2005-08 didn't have a clear dominator. 2009 was dominated only for the first 7 races.   In 2010 we had 4 contenders for the title, from 3 teams, in the last race.   In 2012 we had 7 first races won by 7 different drivers from 5(?) different teams and the epic battle between Alonso and Vettel."
formula1,3detg8,JC-Dude,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:45:41 2015 UTC,"Yes, there were definitely years where utter dominance has not been the case. What I'm talking about is an overall trend. Ferrari one 3 back-to-back in the 70s, Mclaren won 4 on-the-trot in the in the late-80'sl/early-90's and Williams took 3 in-a-row after that. But in 1999 the record stood at 4 championships in a row (constructor's), that was eclipsed by Ferrari then matched by Red Bull; now we are seeing a level of superiority that hasn't been seen in decades.   It's easy, for me at least, to forget seasons as recent as 2012 but. I realize that what I've been saying is almost certainly not correct but It's been many years since more than one team has really fought for a Constructor's Championship. Not since 2008 have two teams slugged it out for the championship."
formula1,3detg8,jalepeno,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:00:34 2015 UTC,"its all in the rules. They are written in a intentionally narrow way to prevent loopholes, out of control spending, and whatever other reason the FIA give, but the end result is that there isn't too many special things you can do to a car. All the teams converge on similar ideas. super short noses are one of the current trends. Mercedes is doing the best and everyone is trying to catch up, but mercedes is just pulling further ahead since they have the best refined concept. The teams are only allowed so much wind tunnel and computation time so it isn't good enough to just chase after what mercedes has done. Pretty much, some engineer would have to get lucky with a creative rule interpretation or stumble upon a new aero concept that is within the rules. Catching mercedes power wise is even trickier with the token system since you can't fix your engine without careful testing. any mistakes would also be locked"
formula1,3detg8,Throwaway_May2015,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:36:05 2015 UTC,"I think the issue is how restricted the rules are now, and you could argue that's good or bad (cost, etc...). Ferrari in the early 2000's was able to dominate because of having their own test track, and massive influx of tobacco sponsorship money. Red Bull was able to innovate through loopholes and earned their championships, the car was fast even as other teams adopted the tech. All periods have domination at one point or another, Honda Mclaren (1st go round), Williams in the 90's, and even Team Lotus at some points (Lotus 49,72,78). But the current rules don't allow teams to make massive tech changes over short periods of time, so unless something is done about it, I don't really see this changing until 2017."

It's not the same as points on the licence (although that does also exist in motorsport). Recently the FIA introduced a new points system for calculating who can get their superlicence to drive in F1. Points are awarded to drivers for winning other series like GP2, Formula 3.5 etc, and if they accumulate enough points then they can get a superlicence."
