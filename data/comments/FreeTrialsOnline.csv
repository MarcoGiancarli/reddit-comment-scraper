FreeTrialsOnline,3dbj6g,SHIT_SOUP,1 point,Wed Jul 15 01:26:08 2015 UTC,Bypassing location restrictions and to give you a theoretical layer of privacy.  I'm sure people have other uses but those are the two main ones for the general public. Well the small slice of the general public that uses VPN's.

FreeTrialsOnline,3bhmvv,EarlyBirdUK,5,Mon Jun 29 08:12:41 2015 UTC,"I've noticed a lot of these ""free"" trials are just deals where you pay for X number of months in advance and then receive the first month free. This is not my idea of a free trial. Free trails are try before you buy."
FreeTrialsOnline,3bhmvv,LicenceToBill,1 point,Mon Jun 29 12:07:08 2015 UTC,"I haven't looked into this deal but it looks similar to graze where you get a free sample box, and then you are set to automatically receive more boxes, but you can cancel it once you get the free box and you don't spend anything."

At least two features break various things, specifically their ""Scan SSL"" function breaks virtually all HTTPS pages and another feature meant to hide your system from other devices on the local network makes it impossible to connect to local shares. There's also some reported issues with it causing excessively long boot times on some systems but that's less common.  You can do a lot worse for antivirus/firewall, but take the above into consideration."
FreeTrialsOnline,3baptb,jordguitar,1 point,Sat Jun 27 20:34:03 2015 UTC,"You can turn Scan SSL off (along with other network based scans).  As for long boot times, it can vary depending on how fast your computer is and how much is in your boot.  After it is running, it is very hard to tell it is actually there. They do try and make it as light as possible and only let itself be known when there is a problem that needs your attention."

FreeTrialsOnline,3b1289,Plexiii13,11,Fri Jun 26 04:10:23 2015 UTC,I found it really expensive. The games always seemed to take up to a week to get delivered back to Gamefly. So you'd only get like 4 or fewer rentals in a month.
FreeTrialsOnline,3b1289,Onetwenty7,4,Fri Jun 26 05:04:01 2015 UTC,"I really wish they were faster with every aspect of the service, because it's really awesome to be able to play several AAA games in a month and only spend ~$20.   But, that's rarely the case, as you say."
FreeTrialsOnline,3b1289,blaek_,3,Fri Jun 26 05:47:13 2015 UTC,it's really awesome to be able to play several AAA games in a month and only spend ~$20.    I do that at the public library. I hadn't paid much attention to their selection other than donating a couple of games and glancing over it when they first built the collection. Fast forward a year or two and I happened to pass by the shelf and look it over and realized they preorder big titles.
FreeTrialsOnline,3b1289,gaardyn,4,Sat Jun 27 13:39:59 2015 UTC,"Depends on a few things for it to be worth it, you need to know that you'll actually play the games for one, I'm guilty of renting games then not playing them for 2 months due to being busy. And dependng on how far you live from a shipping center can make a difference too.   But one thing I absolutely found to be worth it, I sign up for the 2 games at a time plan over like September - December, I get to play the new single player games with little no replay value without having to drop $60 a pop. Last year I paid for 3 months of the 2 game plan (so about $60 total) and played probably $300 worth of games"
