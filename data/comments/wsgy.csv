wsgy,3e16s7,ASS_KRACKERS,9,Tue Jul 21 04:13:10 2015 UTC,"It's odd, but, I could try to explain. I know we all like to meme but I just need to let off steam and you guys seem like the only ones I can do it to.   I am afraid of my future and of what lies after that. I am not a believer in God but I have the guilt of a believer. I remember everything I have been taught while growing up in Catholicism and it makes me scared to live the way I want to live.   It is odd. I don't know how to explain it, friend. Though, I just know that I am afraid of living. I know that I am afraid of my future and afraid of the responsibilities that come with it.   I am sorry if that makes no sense. I am not good with words."
wsgy,3e16s7,KezMetch,8,Tue Jul 21 04:20:03 2015 UTC,"For me it is hard to do much of anything without having an end goal, and while life is short, it is long enough such that I struggle to have an end goal.   Would you say you live in the moment or plan ahead?"

wsgy,3e16s7,KezMetch,10,Tue Jul 21 04:54:47 2015 UTC,I set one major long term life goal and work towards it. The short term I am mindful of.  The rest I let flow over me and enjoy the ride.
wsgy,3e16s7,Venomousvillainy,8,Tue Jul 21 05:23:26 2015 UTC,"do you have a goal that's time-dependent (like ""I'd like to see my kids get married"") or not (like ""I'd like to make the world better"")"
wsgy,3e16s7,dukesinbad,9,Tue Jul 21 05:47:14 2015 UTC,My major goal of 'eternal life glory for my children' is non time specific and will never be completed. My secondary life goal is academic and is thus time dependent.

If you skipped you had to make it up by walking a mile at the end of the year for each day you skipped.

For instance I had a friend in NYC who while washing dishes could clearly see a guy across the alley masturbating in his office with some regularity. The dude never closed the drapes he just went for it and didn't even consider the possibility that everyone across the street could see him participating in extracuricular activities

Jacob and his family migrated to Ancient Egypt after being invited to live with Joseph (who rose to the rank of Pharaoh's Moneycounter) in the Land of Big Nose region by Pharaoh himself. The patriarchs' descendants were later enslaved until the Exodus led by Moses, which is commonly dated to the 13th century BCE."

wsgy,3cas5t,lehappyman,10,Mon Jul 6 15:19:16 2015 UTC,My kid is highly autistic and tbh it isn't that bad. I do get really depressed about it because sometimes people point and laugh when he starts flapping his arms and acting weird but I try to be positive about it. Things could be a lot worse. He is a sweet kid and at least he is happy.
wsgy,3cas5t,JollyJudy,5,Mon Jul 6 13:53:04 2015 UTC,I get a lot of autistic people at the pool I work at. And I've always wanted to ask what it's like. Also have you seen 'The Babadook'?
wsgy,3cas5t,NarwhalPlaneFucker,6,Tue Jul 7 00:15:07 2015 UTC,I have not seen it. It is really hard to communicate with my kid. His speech and language is not where it should be so I have no idea what is going through his head.
wsgy,3cas5t,JollyJudy,5,Tue Jul 7 00:46:21 2015 UTC,"That's rough, how old is he?"
wsgy,3cas5t,NarwhalPlaneFucker,3,Tue Jul 7 01:03:00 2015 UTC,He is only 3. He will start talking more but I think there will always be challenges with him. A lot of sounds really bother him. I was at the mall with him yesterday and a song was playing in the store. He started screaming and holding his ears. Lights sounds and textures really mess with him. His senses get overloaded. I did not even realize autism affected their senses.
wsgy,3cas5t,JollyJudy,7,Tue Jul 7 01:15:12 2015 UTC,I guess I never thought about sensory malfunction being correlated to autism.
wsgy,3cas5t,NarwhalPlaneFucker,5,Tue Jul 7 02:46:06 2015 UTC,"Wait, really?"
wsgy,3cas5t,wsgy111,10,Mon Jul 6 14:30:30 2015 UTC,this should not be news to you
wsgy,3cas5t,JollyJudy,8,Mon Jul 6 15:32:20 2015 UTC,"I don't think she ever posted about it, but now I think about it I do recall something vaguely in a distant memory about it."
wsgy,3cas5t,reese_ridley,10,Mon Jul 6 15:54:55 2015 UTC,Yeah no joke. He is obsessed with numbers and he spends at least 3 hours a day counting. He is a little calculator and all my friends and family compare him to Rainman. He is not as bad as Rainman tho. He is very obviously autistic tho people frequently ask me what is wrong with him.
wsgy,3cas5t,JollyJudy,6,Mon Jul 6 14:37:54 2015 UTC,how do you feel about his incessant shitposting on wsgy.de
wsgy,3cas5t,reese_ridley,8,Mon Jul 6 15:46:49 2015 UTC,He doesn't get on reddit. He does like YouTube a lot. When I let him use the computer he always goes to YouTube. He is very tech savvy for a 3 year old

wsgy,3car33,Cespur,5,Mon Jul 6 13:08:50 2015 UTC,"I always used to have some 60 year old Asian couple as a dentist, but they retired a few years back and their practice got taken over by some middle aged polack. But she was out and now I had a 30 year old milf with a bomb ass teen assistant and this is unacceptable.   When I needed surgery in my lip a few years back I had some dude as a surgeon but he had three hot ass assistants too. I will not stand for this."
wsgy,3car33,wsgy111,5,Mon Jul 6 13:16:53 2015 UTC,That picture of Ed eating a sandwich is one of those things that makes me laugh harder the longer I look at it
wsgy,3car33,Generally_Happy_,5,Mon Jul 6 15:33:41 2015 UTC,so insecure
wsgy,3car33,Dirtydirtdirtt,4,Mon Jul 6 19:28:36 2015 UTC,"One time, Probably when I was 12  I had to go to the doctor for my yearly physical. I wasn't really fazed by it because I had an old black lady doctor. Well, She wasn't in that day and some other young attractive doctor was covering for her. When she checked my scrotum to see if my testicles had descended and give them an examination, I had to try really hard not to get an erection.   Another story, A few years ago when I was starting nursing school I had to get a physical and a form signed off for school saying that I was fit for duty. I hadn't been to my doctor in like 9 years, in fact she had died a few years before that. The only doctor that I knew of was the pill pushing ARNP that my girlfriend had been seeing. She was probably in her early 30's, blonde, medium height, in shape. The kind of girl that wsgy could never get.  I went in for my appt. and was waiting for her to do my scrotal examination, kind of nervous about it actually (Thinking back on it now, I realize she probably wouldn't have done one because it was expected that my testicles had already dropped, but thats all I knew since I hadn't been to a doctor since i was a pre teen) Anyway's she didn't do it. I didn't even get to take off my fucking pants.   After watching a 2 hour video during school about how to do an examination, i felt really cheated because the doctor touched the patients scrote and ween for like a solid 5 minutes.   Bullshit."

wsgy,3car33,Kellerbier,3,Tue Jul 7 13:31:06 2015 UTC,yes you can turn it positive but overall it's better to not have a girl see blood gushing down your chin when youre making your first move

wsgy,3ca85o,nope_nic_tesla,3,Mon Jul 6 17:31:52 2015 UTC,I'm interested to see what all the creditors do. It'd probably be better to write off a lot of their debt and accept lower payments than get paid back in a bunch of worthless drachma
wsgy,3ca85o,hgwaz,5,Mon Jul 6 11:41:30 2015 UTC,"giving them the drachma back and heavily devaliung it is the best idea imo. Imports would get expensive, so they'd be forced to buy Greek products which would strengthen their economy"

Nothing at the pier is worthwhile except maybe the view from the lake on the boats I work on, and even then only during the week when it's cheaper. If you're into it they do fireworks every Wednesday and Saturday that you can watch from the shore for free. Wrigleyville is a big bar area. The mag mile is a big shopping area if you're into that"

There is only deep-dish pizza available.  It is not the ""Willis Tower,"" it's the ""Sears Tower."" That's just how it be.  Downtown is fun if you've never been in a city before, just go to the Art Institute or the Shedd Aquarium if you want to look at stuff that isn't boring.  Everyone takes a picture next to the Bean. So should you. Also, there's these cool statue-like buildings with changing faces and water pouring out of them. That's about as interesting as it gets if you don't like shopping. If you do like shopping, and like expensive food, go to Eataly. Just get used to how vaguely Italian everything is there, oh and check out the Nutella shop! Probably one of the best things in Chicago besides the Ghiradelli store.  Never wear a Sox Hat, and remember everyone both hates and loves the Cubs.  Get used to Polish people and black people.   They are the most common, asides from Asian tourists who have no idea what they're doing get the fuck out of the street no you can't cross yet"

wsgy,3bzc0f,mildr3d,3,Fri Jul 3 13:21:35 2015 UTC,"Yes I'm saying your metaphor isn't apt. Food isn't about finding the best thing and then sticking to it, it's about variety."
wsgy,3bzc0f,Kellerbier,6,Fri Jul 3 13:23:03 2015 UTC,"Actually it is. Most major fastfood chain's food is pretty shitty, so when I find something at 'em that I like, I stick with 'em knowing that the rest of the menu is gonna be a disappointment. E.g. at McDonalds I always order either the Big Tasty, or a Big Mac. And when I do I always get it without bacon. Not because I'm scared of change, but because I know McDonalds bacon is fucking disgusting."
wsgy,3bzc0f,lehappyman,4,Fri Jul 3 13:32:07 2015 UTC,"Maybe that's true of maccas or HJs but there are a few different sandwiches at subway that I enjoy, plus they have something new and interesting every month or so. Last time I went there it was Banh Mi."

wsgy,3btrq3,Cespur,7,Thu Jul 2 13:12:27 2015 UTC,"Active investing is a zero sum game. Over the long-term a majority of professional managers fail to beat out market indices. If professionals can't do it then I probably can't either. When I have more money in the future I might make some specific stock picks in industries/companies that I know a lot about, but other than that stock picking is generally a waste of money."
wsgy,3btrq3,nope_nic_tesla,6,Thu Jul 2 13:15:19 2015 UTC,"My parents do it though occasionally, and have some pretty good yields from that. Those aren't complex multinationals usually though. Like when I was in HS they had stock in this massive indoor snowboarding/skiing type of thing and as a result I got to go for free whenever I wanted. Shit was usually like a 100 bucks in total for normal folks, so I'd bring dates there and they were under the illusion I was spending massive bucks on them while really all I paid for was a drink at the lounge afterwards."

I took an AP Spanish test in high school to get college credit for my Spanish class, and one part of it you had to record yourself speaking in response to some prompts. The proctor never submitted my speaking sections (I was given the excuse that ""it must have been lost in transit when uploading to the server"", an excuse which I know is 100% bullshit), so I had to come back a month later after school had let out to record my speaking sections on tape instead. Then, they lost the tape recording so I never got a score for it.

wsgy,3bqeql,hgwaz,6,Wed Jul 1 10:52:14 2015 UTC,it's redistricting voting districts in a way that you can be almost certain you win said district. in america being the corrupt cunts that they are it ends up with voting districts looking like this

wsgy,3bqeql,dukesinbad,3,Wed Jul 1 13:27:03 2015 UTC,nah i just wrote the title weird. but this is the first step to banning it because if this ruling had been the other way gerrymandering wouldn't stop without a a congressional vote which wouldn't have happened. now states can establish these independent committees fairly easily
wsgy,3bqeql,wsgy111,3,Wed Jul 1 14:19:48 2015 UTC,They didn't ban gerrymandering. They upheld the right of states to appoint independent commissions to draw districts. Some states were fighting against this because the Constitution says that Legislatures have to draw the lines. The only rule against gerrymandering that ever gets enforced is that districts have to be contiguous.

This begs the question: ""who are the OG's?"" Would it just be the original handful of people that were here in the first few weeks of this sub's conception? Jess was at one point a newfriend, but it seems she is widely accepted as an OG now. So, how long are you a newfriend before you are accepted as a wsgy OG?"

wsgy,3bk3ko,Kellerbier,10,Tue Jun 30 01:25:29 2015 UTC,Lel. Ruger makes a fine .357 snub but believe me when I say that fucker isn't what you want to take on the range. 25 rounds in and your hands are gonna feel like they were smashed by hammers.   They make a decent choice for home defence though.
wsgy,3bk3ko,Cespur,9,Tue Jun 30 01:29:45 2015 UTC,i wouldnt want to take it to the range too much. i want a compact self defense weapon. i might get something that fires .38 special instead.

wsgy,3b8igw,hgwaz,7,Sat Jun 27 00:25:28 2015 UTC,"I read that Austria and Hungary both are now refusing brown people. Like in EU, illegals are dumped back to whichever cunt they originally cross into. In many cases that is A&H because of their geological location. So illegals caught in France, Spain, Sweden, etc get dumped back on you guys. Only now your government has frozen all new applicants and outright refused any more people going against EU policies lel. About goddamn time you guys stood up and said enough with these fucking trash leeches."
wsgy,3b8igw,Dr_Wiggsel_Maarten,6,Sat Jun 27 00:41:17 2015 UTC,"Correct.  In Hungary one guy got >75% one election ago, so he has absolute power. First thing he did was change the limit to 66% and got elected again. So he can do whatever the fuck he wants. Which contains reinstating the death sentence, which will almost force the EU to throw them out.   Here in Austria the federal districts haven't done enough to be able to take on their quota of refugees, so our minister of domestic affairs (or whatever the term is, internal stuff) wants to dump them into military baracks. People arr fed up with the EU's bs, so right now a petition is making rounds about leaving the EU. Good times might lie ahead."
wsgy,3b8igw,hgwaz,4,Sat Jun 27 00:52:18 2015 UTC,quota of refugees   what the fuck?
wsgy,3b8igw,Cespur,2,Sat Jun 27 02:17:31 2015 UTC,"Ye, we have to make room for a specific amount, depending on the population of each district."
wsgy,3b8igw,hgwaz,2,Sun Jun 28 04:45:30 2015 UTC,That guy Hungary is a fucking cunt who's in love with Putin. There's a reason they call that shithole Russia's Trojan horse into the EU.   Also Austria won't leave the EU.

wsgy,3b4m94,nope_nic_tesla,6,Thu Jun 25 23:24:00 2015 UTC,make an assessment
wsgy,3b4m94,nope_nic_tesla,12,Fri Jun 26 01:21:14 2015 UTC,Based on what I expect it to be...  Conflicted feels  International trade agreements can be good because it provides an even playing field for competition and reduces the incentive for race to the bottom regulatory policies (same reason standardized federal laws can sometimes be more efficient than a state-by-state patchwork)   On the flip side though it will likely contain a lot of regulatory standards that are lower than current U.S. law   I don't think there's enough info out yet to have much more of an opinion than that
wsgy,3b4m94,nope_nic_tesla,7,Fri Jun 26 01:25:06 2015 UTC,Correct assessment  Though sometimes lower regulatory standards are ok.
wsgy,3b4m94,ASS_KRACKERS,11,Fri Jun 26 01:28:26 2015 UTC,Yes but not generally in areas of environmental and safety regulation which the TPP will certainly cover

wsgy,3b3zjl,lehappyman,9,Thu Jun 25 20:44:33 2015 UTC,"""committing war crimes""  implying all the other middle eastern nations are NOT   ignoring the fact that most people in these middle eastern nations sympathize and support the terrorists that oppose Western freedom   In Europe almost everyone is pro-Palestine because they've never even heard of Palestine until like late 2014.  Israel is not racist nor should they be scolded for being extra suspicious. Maybe if we supported Israel more and led to more stable democracies like it, we could see the end of war crimes.   At least then, we'd know if Israel was truly evil or not."
wsgy,3b3zjl,lehappyman,13,Thu Jun 25 20:17:19 2015 UTC,"m8 say about the issue what you want but one thing that doesn't hold up is ""israel isnt racist""  there are so many stories, videos, and statements by prominent israelis about fucking the arabs over  also they disproportionately strike back every time. like a palestinian mortar lands somewhere in an empty soccer field and one israeli bruises his arm or some shit and they respond with carpet bombing a couple of blocks of civilian homes and killing a dozens of people. i mean c'mon now"
wsgy,3b3zjl,reese_ridley,10,Thu Jun 25 20:21:10 2015 UTC,"Israelis being suspicious of Arabs  most Arabs hate Jews  Arabs literally firing shells into Israel because they hate Jews  ""They shouldn't strike back like that.""   Why aren't the Palestinian people tired of their governments and their terrorist organizations bombing Israel and then getting disproportionate reactions?   You'd think there would be civil outcry in these countries because their leaders are pissing off Israel, but it doesn't look like it. In fact, the only thing that these people seem to be angry about is the existence of Israel.  I don't like the deaths of innocents but one must question why these innocents aren't actively standing up against their governments. Almost as if a good majority hate Jews and want to use the ""disproportionate reactions"" as some sort of support-gathering agenda rather than try and help themselves advance as a nation.  I don't love Israel but I will support the emergence of Western Democracy as long as it follows the American Model TM and not the European style ""progressive ideology"" of most European countries, including my own.   mfw I'm arguing about jews on wsgy  what happened to hating the buddhists"
wsgy,3b3zjl,reese_ridley,11,Thu Jun 25 20:26:22 2015 UTC,"m8 most of the attacks against dem jews arent organized attempts by the gubberment, they're just a bunch of looneys. how would you feel if a couple of hillbillies in TX kept firing rockets occasionally into mehico and the mexicans responded by leveling downtown houston? i mean bane would die so that would be pretty sweet but what about normal people"

wsgy,3b3dwj,wsgy111,9,Thu Jun 25 18:15:55 2015 UTC,Most girls I know will get mad if a guy they are around is checking out another girl. I don't care tho because I am usually the one to point out the hot girl.

wsgy,3b3dwj,JollyJudy,6,Thu Jun 25 18:57:43 2015 UTC,that's fuggin weird. I've never seen that before.
wsgy,3b3dwj,reese_ridley,7,Thu Jun 25 20:15:00 2015 UTC,black women are notoriously protective of black men because:   other races don't want to date them as much (at least according to OKcupid) 1 in 10 of their men are in jail (thanks Reagan)   It creates a sort of sexual power vacuum in the black community which is one of the reasons black men can get away with treating them like shit- they are a scarce commodity

He closed the door with the same tender assertiveness as animals lick their newborns and quickly walked away from the hut. He wasn't entirely sure where to go now, as the governor had ordered all signposts to be moved or destroyed, so that the algae couldn't find their palace anymore. As he walked towards where he thought the mouth could have been,"
wsgy,3amm9w,Kellerbier,5,Sun Jun 21 21:50:35 2015 UTC,im joining the military after college tho
wsgy,3amm9w,Cespur,3,Mon Jun 22 17:06:29 2015 UTC,"I'm being serious here, don't.  Although I do reference it often as it was a big part of my life for a long time, it was one of the biggest mistakes of my life, and I've yet to meet a sane person who says otherwise of their own experience."
wsgy,3amm9w,Kellerbier,5,Mon Jun 22 20:13:12 2015 UTC,"Wait, why not?"
wsgy,3amm9w,Cespur,4,Tue Jun 23 00:32:19 2015 UTC,"Everything about the military is a fucking mess of inefficiency. Never dig with a shovel when you can dig with a spoon. Never walk through a door if you can climb a wall. I expected that during my training, but that mindset carries on throughout the entirety,  and through every level of the command structure.  You get NCOs who are literally retarded, but are in charge of your life because they run faster then you. Also you get officers who will make your life a living hell for no other reason then because they can. I don't wanna get too far into it, but for every pleasant memory I've had of it, there are at least 20 that infuriate me. And as I've said, this isn't unique to my country or former rank. I've heard this from literally every serviceman I've ever spoken to, from the US, France, Hungary and even Finland, from all ranks ranging from private to captian. Not to mention the vets I know who are fucked for life and were basically left alone to their memories after their service.  If you want to get into uniformed service, I reccomend law enforcement or intelligence.  I hear less horror stories."
wsgy,3amm9w,Kellerbier,3,Tue Jun 23 01:34:48 2015 UTC,"Hmm, interesting. Because of my education I'll start out as an officer right from the get go though, so I won't have as many retard above me. I'm still undecided on what branch, but I was thinking either the Navy (marines) or the Gendarmerie. If I pick the latter I'll mostly spend most of my days hanging around our airports or protecting the royal family.  However they're also most likely to be send abroad so that kinda blows."
wsgy,3amm9w,Cespur,4,Tue Jun 23 09:20:34 2015 UTC,"Officer ranks get it as bad or worse. Trust me, go law enforcement."
wsgy,3amm9w,Kellerbier,3,Tue Jun 23 11:10:15 2015 UTC,"Why? I thought you were inferring having to take commands from high school dropouts who just happened to run faster than you was one of the main sticking points.   But the gendarmerie here is basically a paramilitary law enforcement force, who just happened to have military training and equipment (e.g. regular law enforcement here doesn't have automatic weapons or heavy machinery, but only pistols). They also guard the embassies abroad and stuff, and serve as border patrol, and as counter terrorism units.   It's not really a combat position in the sense of ending up fighting the Taliban or anything like that, although they do get send abroad to accompany regular troops in order to train local forces, and they serve as the MPs for our own troops.   Like I said, it's basically law enforcement with a military context. But I know some lads who are in different branches of the military, I'll ask around a bit. It wouldn't be for a couple of years down the road anyhow, so I got a lot of time to think it over."
wsgy,3amm9w,wsgy111,4,Tue Jun 23 11:16:15 2015 UTC,"Yeah that was definitely a sticking point, but even I led a chalk for a bit and commanding them isn't much better. I know what the Gendarmes are, I do believe it would be a preferable alternative to the regular army"

wsgy,3ae8zc,DubTeeDub,9,Fri Jun 19 13:22:07 2015 UTC,Ok it did taste a little bit different.  Have to get higher quality coffee once this tin is done
wsgy,3ae8zc,MinosOfKnossus,9,Fri Jun 19 14:09:32 2015 UTC,"Don't grind too fine, don't pour in water while it's boiling (wait a minute for it to cool slightly), lightly agitate it and then let it steep for about 5 minutes before plunging   You can find your ideal amount of coffee to use or let it steep longer or shorter if you like as well   What's nice about french press is you can tailor it more closely to what you like"

wsgy,3ae8zc,noided_man,10,Fri Jun 19 13:04:11 2015 UTC,I don't like it because snobs like nic talk about it like everybody who doesnt use one is a loser
wsgy,3ae8zc,Kellerbier,11,Fri Jun 19 14:08:12 2015 UTC,It's just a fact that stuff like french press and aeropress make better tasting coffee than drip.  It's okay to like things that are good / popular sometimes.

He was a 2014 Allen graduate in business administration.  “He was a quiet, well-known student who was committed to his education,” Cole said. “He presented a warm and helpful spirit as he interacted with his colleagues. Mr. Sanders was participating in the Bible study session at Mother Emanuel church at the time of the shooting.”     He was a more valuable member of society than any white guy     Roof may have had “white supremacist leanings,” the Anti-Defamation League, an organization that fights anti-Semitism and bigotry, said in a statement.     glad they figured that out within 5 minutes of a white guy shooting black people     South Carolina NAACP President Lonnie Randolph said there is still a large racism problem in the fabric of South Carolina. “This is a state that feels that it is okay to fly the Confederate flag in front of our State House,” Randolph said. “Now that is a welcome to have on your State House grounds, isn't it? ... We need to work together to make the lives of (Pinckney's) children better in South Carolina.”     THE ENTIRE CIVIL WAR WAS ABOUT SLAVERY THAT IS THE ONLY REASON THAT IS IT ANNANANANANA I'M NOT LISTENING RACISTS     Neal said he believes the shooting was racially motivated. The state needs to have an “honest discussion about race relations,” he said. Neal said, however, that he does not think there is any support politically for gun control.   Let me say it again, racism!"

wsgy,39yinr,wsgy111,7,Mon Jun 15 20:49:41 2015 UTC,kill whitey tbh
wsgy,39yinr,MaximumCarlos,3,Mon Jun 15 20:49:58 2015 UTC,when I grow up I want to be the only man/woman/carbon based life form alive. it will set me apart from the competition
wsgy,39yinr,Cespur,3,Tue Jun 16 02:11:45 2015 UTC,What were you doing at a HS graduation? Looking for gf?
wsgy,39ybds,Generally_Happy_,10,Mon Jun 15 20:00:26 2015 UTC,Badeo gums
wsgy,39ybds,lehappyman,7,Mon Jun 15 20:02:54 2015 UTC,Sat at home.
wsgy,39ybds,noided_man,5,Mon Jun 15 20:05:31 2015 UTC,I have some doubts about this game but I'm too excited to care
wsgy,39ybds,noided_man,7,Mon Jun 15 20:07:39 2015 UTC,tell me your doubts
wsgy,39ybds,hgwaz,5,Mon Jun 15 20:12:13 2015 UTC,"I'm a bit bummed about the dialogue, which was my favorite parts of the other Fallout games (well, mostly the 2D ones, where you could trick people into cutting their fingers off for no reason and stuff)  for the rest I'm just wondering if the cool parts (settlements, upgrades for your power armor, weapon benches, etc.) won't get tiring too fast  but I just want it to come out already"
wsgy,39ybds,noided_man,6,Mon Jun 15 20:30:10 2015 UTC,"Weapon mods in fo3 New Vegas are still cool imo, and I've played the fuck out of those games. Power Armor crafting is awesome too.  I'm pretty sure my first character is gonna shit on the story and just build a base, loot everything nearby and keep expanding. I'll have to progress a bit in the story to unlock crafting bases though I believe."
wsgy,39ybds,hgwaz,3,Mon Jun 15 20:36:44 2015 UTC,"Weapon mods in fo3 New Vegas are still cool imo, and I've played the fuck out of those games   oh yeah, for sure, but it seems really switched up to a new level here  I mean most of my doubts are baseless anyways"
wsgy,39ybds,noided_man,5,Mon Jun 15 20:43:53 2015 UTC,"I'm trying not to doubt anything at all, so I won't go  into the game thinking x is shit. I wanna find out myself.  Also, I think a voiced protagonist is cool as shit, I don't think it's gonna limit your dialogue options that much."
wsgy,39ybds,hgwaz,5,Mon Jun 15 20:48:17 2015 UTC,"But I'll get to be pleasantly surprised :^)  The limit for me is the dynamic dialogue wheel, not the voice (tho it'd be cool if you could choose it like in, say, Saints Row).   Now that I think about it, a voiced protagonist could offer us fantastic failed speech checks and for that I'm hyped"
wsgy,39ybds,noided_man,6,Mon Jun 15 20:55:08 2015 UTC,Tru  Oh man I hope they do that!  Also voiced low int playthrough could potentially be amazing.
wsgy,39ybds,noided_man,5,Mon Jun 15 21:00:03 2015 UTC,holy shit yeah it would be  maybe that's why the dialogue wheel is evasive
wsgy,39ybds,wsgy111,7,Mon Jun 15 21:02:07 2015 UTC,i'm personally a bit annoyed about the background (married with kid) pushing certain labels on the character  he's supposed to be an asexual degenerate like me dammit
wsgy,39ybds,wsgy111,4,Mon Jun 15 20:46:49 2015 UTC,that too
wsgy,39ybds,Saicotic,6,Mon Jun 15 20:49:03 2015 UTC,I don't much care for the fallout series
wsgy,39ybds,noided_man,7,Mon Jun 15 20:40:03 2015 UTC,die
wsgy,39ybds,memebuck,8,Mon Jun 15 20:43:36 2015 UTC,I'm not into post-apocalyptic settings. I haven't even seen Mad Max yet

wsgy,39ybds,reese_ridley,2,Wed Jun 17 00:09:09 2015 UTC,muh open world  muh crafting  muh redundant resources  muh half these skills are fucking useless  muh clunky guns that can't aim for shit so I wait ten seconds for the instakill meter to recharge

wsgy,39ybds,noided_man,3,Tue Jun 16 08:07:12 2015 UTC,nty I will assassinate the overseer while you collect 30 red flowers to craft medicine for an old woman who holds the only key to a vault that contains a clue to the whereabouts of a furniture salesman who bought your mother a drink at a bar twenty years ago
wsgy,39ybds,Saicotic,4,Tue Jun 16 08:23:20 2015 UTC,I can't think of any quest like that that's part of the main quest line
wsgy,39ybds,hgwaz,4,Tue Jun 16 08:25:18 2015 UTC,I don't remember fallout 3 very well it was pretty boring except for the giant robot mission and all the environments looked the same wow we have brown AND gray color pallettes  I tried starting a new game recently and gave up after trying to shoot fucking radroaches for 20 minutes with the worst pistol in the universe seriously how hard is it to design a functional gun with a billion dollar budget
wsgy,39ybds,Fallen_Angle,2,Tue Jun 16 08:32:18 2015 UTC,"Oh I never played 3, skipped straight to New Vegas. I have 1, 2, and Tactics tho so I might go back and play those."
wsgy,39ybds,Saicotic,2,Tue Jun 16 08:33:45 2015 UTC,does tactics deserve the bad rep it's got? It looks p fun from what I've seen
wsgy,39ybds,Kellerbier,2,Wed Jun 17 21:40:41 2015 UTC,"no idea tbh, never played it"
wsgy,39ybds,memebuck,4,Thu Jun 18 09:21:41 2015 UTC,Watching the live stream. It was amazing.
wsgy,39ybds,pxifrm,7,Mon Jun 15 20:33:36 2015 UTC,"Back in late 2008?  Hmm... probably playing Battlefront 2, the only game worth anyone's time."

wsgy,39uc9b,nope_nic_tesla,11,Sun Jun 14 21:21:31 2015 UTC,A judge.
wsgy,39uc9b,nope_nic_tesla,15,Sun Jun 14 21:24:45 2015 UTC,Why is a judge better than a jury
wsgy,39uc9b,nope_nic_tesla,14,Sun Jun 14 21:26:54 2015 UTC,"Because you got a guy or gal who spend decades building up legal expertise after already being highly educated by going through lawschool, then went through a vigorous proces of being picked to become a judge, then has their entire mental, social, and regular life being looked at with a microscope, then have this candidate being trained in all kinds of things needed to hand out guilty verdicts such as ethics and appropriate response.  Then when a bad apple somehow still slips through the cracks it's easier to detect. E.g. if you got a judge who routinely over the course of a ton of verdicts shows a pattern of let's say giving out higher sentences to black folks than he does with whites, you can detect this. If you just got some random dude who only has one verdict under his belt as a juror, it's almost impossible to proof bias.  This is infinitely better than having Joe the Plumber or the kid behind the counter at 7/11 literally handing out life sentences or the death penalty."
wsgy,39uc9b,pureguavaa,7,Sun Jun 14 21:35:08 2015 UTC,"Or you get a guy who's old buddies with whoever appoints judges and you get a huge good old boy system. Judgeships are mostly political, not meritocratic"
wsgy,39uc9b,dukesinbad,6,Sun Jun 14 23:36:18 2015 UTC,"Here they are though. Politicians don't get to appoint judges here, it goes to commissions composed of both law-based peeps as well as non-law based peeps. It's a real struggle and you need years and years of experience to even be considered.  It's not just one person who appoints judges here and I believe every time a judge gets appointed a new commission gets formed specifically for that purpose, but don't quote me on that.  Also from what I know about judges Stateside is that they have to be elected and reelected. That doesn't happen here. Judges are appointed for life, meaning they don't have to think about the whims of the general public, which, as we all know, is borderline retarded."

wsgy,39ue9f,noided_man,5,Mon Jun 15 07:29:06 2015 UTC,"What do you mean American comics? Like the guys who write the comics?  It has probably something to do with Amsterdam's free spirit. I mean I think it's hard to find a more liberal city in what is already one of the most liberal countries on earth. If you believe in progressive values Amsterdam is the place to be. Aide from that the city is fucking awesome. It has this weird sense of community that reminds you of a tiny village despite it being a metropolitan city, sorta like some neighborhoods in NYC have too."

wsgy,39irpf,MinosOfKnossus,8,Fri Jun 12 00:34:13 2015 UTC,"my uncle is a tech millionaire with a house that's at least 2k square feet with beach views in SoCal, and he wears 20 year old Birkenstocks and t-shirts from tech conventions that don't cover his large beer belly."
wsgy,39irpf,KezMetch,6,Fri Jun 12 01:26:10 2015 UTC,Hello I am your uncle
wsgy,39irpf,MinosOfKnossus,9,Fri Jun 12 02:47:40 2015 UTC,"fuck you and your awful shirts uncle! also when you gave me that iPod from Spain, it wasn't a very good iPod. Also the instructions were in italian, french and spanish, NONE OF WHICH I SPEAK."

wsgy,39irpf,KezMetch,5,Fri Jun 12 04:39:49 2015 UTC,complaining about being given an expensive piece of consumer electronics for free  needing instructions to operate an iPod   Why were you unbanned?
wsgy,39irpf,mildr3d,6,Fri Jun 12 04:16:42 2015 UTC,I didn't need instructions. I am upset when I don't see patriotism in the form of everything on earth being in American. the way it should be

wsgy,39irpf,pureguavaa,7,Fri Jun 12 02:30:19 2015 UTC,i just picture her complimenting the neckbeards on their fedoras in public and they see her cross necklace and they realize no one less than twice their age has complimented them and they can't say anything other than thank you cus she's just a nice older lady. then they go home and shitpost on the internet about it.
wsgy,39irpf,KezMetch,8,Fri Jun 12 02:10:41 2015 UTC,Do you think they tip to each other to acknowledge their excellent fashion sense?
wsgy,39irpf,Generally_Happy_,9,Fri Jun 12 02:22:16 2015 UTC,"i imagine so. i wonder how many people have witnessed it - two fedora fags, complete strangers, out in public and by chance passing each other, a tip here and a tip there. it would be a sight to see i tell ya. i wonder what someone who's unaware of the subculture would think. i'm sure the police have been called before.  i guess if you hang around the mall or somewhere with a card/comic book store you'd see it."
wsgy,39irpf,hgwaz,7,Fri Jun 12 02:33:04 2015 UTC,this world isn't safe for children anymore. two tips and their innocence is gone

wsgy,39ik01,antennanarivo,2,Fri Jun 12 02:31:34 2015 UTC,"I haven't researched this a lot, but it seems it's only an argument against a program for strong AI. It is still possible to build an electronic replica of a brain and I see no reason why that shouldn't function like a brain either."
wsgy,39ik01,hgwaz,3,Fri Jun 12 10:31:11 2015 UTC,"Noone really understands consciousness at this point, so it's too soon to say. But yes, the point is in this kind of paradigm, AI is not at all comparable to human intelligence."

wsgy,39gicw,Rachat21,8,Thu Jun 11 15:59:47 2015 UTC,"yeah, and they developed a sort of weird hatred for reddit over the past few months because of that"
wsgy,39gicw,noided_man,8,Thu Jun 11 16:01:32 2015 UTC,Most of them think that the things that originated on Reddit are actually started by Imgurians (e.g. banana for scale).

wsgy,39grof,antennanarivo,3,Thu Jun 11 17:37:49 2015 UTC,"well, yeah. you want a perfect example, look at Tia or SRS"
wsgy,39grof,dukesinbad,4,Thu Jun 11 17:50:03 2015 UTC,"well yes but what im saying is FPH ramped itself up so much that they are forgot some things and were just in a blind rage. Now that they will get around normal redditors the memes they spout are going to be downvoted and mocked (ideally) and they might moderate their views or gain some self-awareness (again, ideally)"
wsgy,39grof,1Cu14Cu,4,Thu Jun 11 17:57:26 2015 UTC,"Or, they could use sympathy from this banning to generate more support for their hatred, and potentially change popular opinion in their favour.   I honestly don't care, but it'll be interesting to see what'll happen. I know voat's been ddosed as a result of the exodus."

I got this one in particular because all the bad reviews said it was too stiff, so I figured it'd be better to get something that's too stiff and add some more foam to it than get something that is too soft and not be able to do anything about it"

The only reason we starting to see these so often all of s sudden is because everyone has a camera with them nowadays. I have to believe this has been going on for decades if not ever.   There's a city in California that found that the moment it's police officers started wearing cameras, citizen complaints about police abuse dropped by 60%, simply because everyone is on their best behavior. That should tell you enough about how US police operates when they're not being filmed and how they think they can act with impunity."

wsgy,396xi7,1Cu14Cu,14,Tue Jun 9 18:18:16 2015 UTC,fax machines are curiously ubiquitous in the medical world. even as a student i had to fax shit all the damn time. meanwhile surgeons are using 5 million dollar robots to take out your prostate
wsgy,396xi7,wsgy111,11,Tue Jun 9 18:23:08 2015 UTC,Its like certain segments of our nation have not discovered scanning yet.
wsgy,396xi7,wsgy111,10,Tue Jun 9 18:30:49 2015 UTC,I'm not entirely sure there aren't legal hurdles to deal with when it comes to scanning vs faxing. Most of the time the info that is being sent is sensitive and it might be they don't want hospitals to get hacked and leak thousands of people's medical histories
wsgy,396xi7,TherealMarkNutt,8,Tue Jun 9 18:39:07 2015 UTC,"I guess that makes sense, but you can still intercept faxes"

One day it will all be electronic, we just have to give it all time. Its taken the last 20 years for companies to get into electronic charting and still even some companies don't do it."
wsgy,396xi7,KezMetch,8,Tue Jun 9 19:35:55 2015 UTC,I worked at a bunch of gubbernment and ghetto hospitals maybe that has something to do with it

wsgy,396xi7,Cespur,8,Tue Jun 9 19:50:38 2015 UTC,"Literally every place I have been to uses EMR but that doesn't mean you dont need a fax machine. CPRS is the best but you still have to fax things when people went to a non VA or tricare system. Unless the two locations have the same software we had to send physical copies, especially immunization records  I'm exaggerating a bit but it was a shock to me since I literally never used a fax machine until I was 26"

wsgy,396drn,Cespur,8,Tue Jun 9 18:58:10 2015 UTC,"he's still technically right, but it's pretty clear there is a bias for killing blacks on a case by case basis. I mean that chart sort of says if you're black you're 2.5ish times more likely to get killed by a cop but since white people make up a lot more of the population they have higher absolute numbers"
wsgy,396drn,Cespur,9,Tue Jun 9 19:23:46 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's a retarded way of looking at stats. Duke just went full Fox News. I mean the country is 80% white it would be pretty fucking outrageous if blacks were killed more in absolute numbers by da coppers."

wsgy,396drn,nope_nic_tesla,6,Tue Jun 9 21:33:19 2015 UTC,Most people in my high school did not learn statistics. It was an elective class only offered as Advanced Placement credit
wsgy,396drn,Cespur,6,Tue Jun 9 21:40:36 2015 UTC,"Well, actually learning how to do statistics and all the technical terms and all that you don't learn in HS.

wsgy,396drn,nope_nic_tesla,8,Tue Jun 9 22:17:06 2015 UTC,In sheer numbers yeah but whites are like 6x more of the population. On a per capita basis black people are way more likely to be killed by police   Even then the numbers are unclear because most departments do not report this information in the first place
wsgy,396drn,Fallen_Angle,6,Tue Jun 9 18:58:05 2015 UTC,"Well yeah, that's because there's a disproportionate amount of black criminals.  Maybe stop committing crimes, and making media content about committing crimes, and then you won't be treated like criminals?  I know if Polish people in the UK were always suspected of being criminals it would be because of Polish rap and stuff, but the Polish are honest and hard-working so everybody loves us except jealous Russians."
wsgy,396drn,Kellerbier,5,Tue Jun 9 20:23:35 2015 UTC,b8ing this hard
wsgy,396drn,nope_nic_tesla,4,Wed Jun 10 02:07:04 2015 UTC,"Which in itself is an effect of discrimination. As an example, white people and black people smoke marijuana at nearly identical rates, yet black people are more than 3 times as likely to be arrested for marijuana possession. So in this case, black people don't actually commit more crime, they just get arrested and convicted for it way more often.  The statistics here aren't as clear cut as people want you to believe. Black people are incarcerated at far higher rates, but it's hard to tease out how much of that is due to actually committing more crime, and how much of it is due to the fact that they are significantly more likely to be arrested and convicted for committing the same crimes."
wsgy,396drn,nope_nic_tesla,5,Tue Jun 9 20:48:21 2015 UTC,This video gives an excellent depiction of how police treat white and black people differently.
wsgy,396drn,Fallen_Angle,7,Tue Jun 9 20:50:37 2015 UTC,"one town  only two test subjects  only one officer tested   Obviously horrible what happened but you can always sue the cop for going above his jurisdiction. If you fight the ""system"" by using it against itself, you will win. That's what MLK did, after all. The opposite method didn't work out so well for Malcolm X.  Yeah, if this was a more nationwide test I'd accept it. I know I wouldn't judge a black person differently whether or not he was legally armed but you surely will concede that there are a large percent of black criminals out of the black population in America, and that while stereotypes are horrible, they exist for at least a small reason.  I should know, you're probably thinking I'm dumb because I'm a pollack...   also, arguing about race on /r/wsgy   stop"
wsgy,396drn,nope_nic_tesla,2,Wed Jun 10 02:49:07 2015 UTC,"Of course that one video isn't a nationwide indictment, it's just an anecdote to show in practice how discrimination works. When black people are significantly more likely to be arrested and convicted for the same crimes, are more likely to be stopped and searched even when no crime is suspected, receive longer sentences for identical crimes, and are less likely to receive probation or be allowed out on parole for identical crimes, we have to ask why. This video gives a small slice of why.   I don't deny that young black males do commit a disproportionate amount of actual crime, but again it's difficult to establish how much of the statistics are actually caused by more crime, and how much of the statistics is due to simply being more likely to be arrested and receiving harsher sentences for the exact same crimes."

wsgy,3913kp,Metallics,4,Mon Jun 8 14:16:26 2015 UTC,If you have the money for a gold Ferarri and don't buy one I'd question your judgement.

wsgy,3914zo,Metallics,8,Mon Jun 8 16:16:19 2015 UTC,"Nobody defines themselves as ""neoliberal"", it's more of a descriptive term. ""Neoliberal"" generally refers to policies of globalization, deregulation and privatization. For example Bill Clinton's presidency was neoliberal in a lot of ways as he passed things like NAFTA and deregulated the financial industry. It harkens back to the more historical use of the term ""liberal"" which meant basically laissez-faire"
wsgy,3914zo,Metallics,5,Mon Jun 8 16:32:42 2015 UTC,"Good points, though globalization through imperialistic gain (manifest destiny, Philippine-American war) is responsible for America's grand place of ""supremacy"" in the first place. Aside from that, who even wants to be some kind of super-state? It seems like a self-fulfilling prophecy where we have the most power, so other countries ask for our help, and as a superpower our economic system is too interconnected to everything else to just let the chips fall where they may."

wsgy,38zo6e,hgwaz,10,Mon Jun 8 08:04:13 2015 UTC,tell me more about trains
wsgy,38zo6e,Generally_Happy_,9,Mon Jun 8 14:19:48 2015 UTC,"The standard track width in Europe is 1435 mm, measuring the distance between the upper tip of the left and right rail. This is because the wagons used to be pulled by horses. Spain and Portugal got the Iberian wide track with 1668 mm. There are stations in Irun and Port Bou (on both coasts) between Spain and France where the wagon's track width can be adjusted. In Russia, Belarus, Ucraine, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Finland they got the Russian wide track with 1520 mm. Only place where you can adjust track width I can remember from the top of my head is between Cop and Zahony on the Ucrainian/Hungarian border.  What's the Dutch word for Belarus?"
wsgy,38zo6e,hgwaz,9,Mon Jun 8 16:36:55 2015 UTC,Wit-Rusland
wsgy,38zo6e,Generally_Happy_,11,Mon Jun 8 18:33:51 2015 UTC,"White Russia, right? In German it's White Russia as well."
wsgy,38zo6e,Kellerbier,10,Mon Jun 8 19:28:56 2015 UTC,yep
wsgy,38zo6e,hgwaz,2,Mon Jun 8 19:29:41 2015 UTC,it means white russia in russian too  Bela- white rus- russia
wsgy,38zo6e,quillsandsofas,2,Tue Jun 9 21:18:32 2015 UTC,"Oh wow, that's p cool. I think etymology is really interesting, especially in the english language."
wsgy,38zo6e,hgwaz,7,Tue Jun 9 21:36:50 2015 UTC,"Everyone forgets about Ireland and its 1600 gauge.  Speaking of gauges, another interesting thing is the Kleinbahn in Bad Orb, which is really an old abandoned standard gauge branch line that was converted to a small (like half as wide) tourist steam train.   pics of the infrastructure in the conversion process   video is the fully operational rwy"
wsgy,38zo6e,quillsandsofas,9,Mon Jun 8 19:15:23 2015 UTC,"Right, fuck, Ireland.  In a small town near me we got the regular track width east-west (following the valley it's in), a thin one (into a village to the south) and a wide one (into a village to the north). Only town in Austria with three track widths. I don't remember the exact widths though, because I work in a rail-focused forwarding agency and we use neither of those."
wsgy,38zo6e,hgwaz,7,Mon Jun 8 19:34:15 2015 UTC,thats p cool
wsgy,38zo6e,quillsandsofas,6,Mon Jun 8 20:01:43 2015 UTC,"Ty  I don't remember ever having seen a single shipment to Ireland. But that's probably because all my customers were mainly importing wood from all over Europe, not much else."
wsgy,38zo6e,hgwaz,3,Mon Jun 8 21:02:51 2015 UTC,"Yeah, Ireland is not really the world region I'd associate wood industry with. Also I have absolutely no idea about the Irish railways, not even that I'd know how their operator is called or what the main liveries are, guess it's just too remote"
wsgy,38zo6e,Metallics,4,Mon Jun 8 21:36:19 2015 UTC,"According to my google research the bottom line is, it's simply not worth it to get a wagon up there and change its track width twice."

We made ""blackout juice,"" which consisted of a handle of everclear, a handle of Smirnoff, koolaid, sprite, and a shitload of sugar. It did the trick. I don't remember the walk home, but the walk home is when the injury went down. It was February and pretty snowy outside, and our fastest route home was to cross these train tracks and walk down a nearby hill. Apparently I thought it would be awesome to slide down the hill face first on my stomach, ""like a penguin."" Well I must have landed at a bad angle because the next morning my wrist was in searing pain and I had no idea why. My friends told me what had happened, and apparently one buddy of mine had done the same thing, but instead of breaking his wrist he scraped the shit out of his nose and left a puddle of blood all over the snow bank. All because we wanted to pretend to be penguins. Yet another reason why birds are not important."

wsgy,38octg,nope_nic_tesla,4,Fri Jun 5 21:50:15 2015 UTC,Probably because they only read press which confirms their bias.

wsgy,38octg,dangerousbob,9,Fri Jun 5 18:04:54 2015 UTC,Basically the idea is that it's an unfair burden on the southern yuros because they get all the poor Africans and Arabs who cross the Mediterranean in shitty boats and then they have to save 'em. This naturally cost enormous amounts of money so now we patrol the southern coast together to relief the Italian and Spanish coast guard and the EU is proposing a quota system where every country takes in a certain amount of these refugees.   This is bc everyone was initially like ya well 2 fckn bad spaghetti eaters not our problem but then Italy threatened to just give all of them temporary residency papers which would mean that because of schengen they could scatter all over yurop and travel wherever they wanted.

""America has the best healthcare system in the world,"" and then they come up with a asinine way of rationalizing it.   Also the whole ""if it weren't for us you'd be talking nazi right now!!!"" gets used so often."

When used inappropriately, it is a fallacy in which a claim or argument is dismissed on the basis of some irrelevant fact or supposition about the author or the person being criticized.   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straw_man   A straw man is a common form of argument and is an informal fallacy based on false representation of an opponent's argument."

You attacked my character implying I posted this to seem more intelligent instead of addressing the content of the post, the shortcomings of Bethesda games.

wsgy,38behr,NinetoFiveHero,12,Wed Jun 3 03:10:55 2015 UTC,"Naruto is a gateway anime of the worst kind. It's a bad series, a clusterfuck of story and characterization that isn't very well done by any aspect, but which attempts to compensate for its weaknesses by adding in excessive shipping faggotry and DARKNESS. The normal anon can see this as the shit it is, and may enjoy it, hate it or be indifferent to it, but all the while recognizing that the series itself, regardless of their opinion, is plain bad.  However, these very aspects that try to smear over the shit of its core make it a breeding ground for aspie, unsociable underageb& faggots who engage in every kind of faggotry both online and in the real world. The superpowered characters all trying their hardest to look cool, the jutsus, peculiar, colorful clothes, the whole ninja faggotry and everything about the Naruto world fuels their escapist fantasies, while the pity-party character backgrounds, emphasis on revenge, and overall preachiness of the series make it fit just right with the mary-sueish drives of your average preteen and his sense of unwarranted self-importance towards the world. Exactly the kind of shit that makes little kiddies and underageb& retards eat this shit right the fuck up.  Naruto is basically THE series to attract the most hated anime fanbase known to /a/, which is why, regardless of individual opinions, it is the responsibility of every anon to troll the fuck out of this show and everyone who likes it, and ensure that no Naruto threads ever encourage the newfriends to show their faces here."

wsgy,3881te,Kellerbier,11,Tue Jun 2 14:49:38 2015 UTC,"Yeah this annoys me a lot too. I bring this up a lot when debating food policy, especially when people say the obesity problem is because healthy food is just so expensive (which itself doesn't make sense, even with less healthy food you will not become obese if you simply eat your recommended amount of calories). Healthy food is extremely cheap, you just have to prepare it yourself. When I bring this up, then everyone wants to pretend that every single low-income family out there is a single-parent household with a mom working 3 jobs and has no time to cook, which I have sympathy for but really is not the norm. I track my spending pretty closely and last year I spent less than $300/month total on groceries, including alcohol purchased at the grocery store. This could easily be much less, too."
wsgy,3881te,nope_nic_tesla,7,Tue Jun 2 15:02:28 2015 UTC,"I once cut my grocery bill to around 20/wk. Nothing cheaper than rice and beans (even cheaper than ramen), and vegetables are super cheap. When you add fruits it starts rising, berries can be obscene even when on sale. A lot of it has to do with people not regularly shopping, they don't recognize a deal when they see one (my opinion). Add in that they may just pick a random recipe and have to buy all the products they don't have, since they don't shop, and a one time buy looks expensive with all the spices and materials etc."

The past few months my BF and I have cut our food budget to $200/mo -- again, including alcohol -- to save money before he moves for medical school."

wsgy,380g75,dukesinbad,2,Mon Jun 1 05:26:34 2015 UTC,"The Quran: Quran (2:191-193) - ""And kill them wherever you find them, and turn them out from where they have turned you out. And Al-Fitnah [disbelief or unrest] is worse than killing... but if they desist, then lo! Allah is forgiving and merciful.   And fight them until there is no more Fitnah [disbelief and worshipping of others along with Allah] and worship is for Allah alone.  But if they cease, let there be no transgression except against Az-Zalimun (the polytheists, and wrong-doers, etc.)""  (Translation is from the Noble Quran)  The verse prior to this (190) refers to ""fighting for the cause of Allah those who fight you"" leading some to believe that the entire passage refers to a defensive war in which Muslims are defending their homes and families.  The historical context of this passage is not defensive warfare, however, since Muhammad and his Muslims had just relocated to Medina and were not under attack by their Meccan adversaries.  In fact, the verses urge offensive warfare, in that Muslims are to drive Meccans out of their own city (which they later did).  Verse 190 thus means to fight those who offer resistance to Allah's rule (ie. Muslim conquest).  The use of the word ""persecution"" by some Muslim translators is disingenuous (the actual Arabic words for persecution - ""idtihad"" - and oppression - a variation of ""z-l-m"" - do not appear in the verse).  The word used instead, ""fitna"",  can mean disbelief, or the disorder that results from unbelief or temptation.  This is certainly what is meant in this context since the violence is explicitly commissioned ""until religion is for Allah"" - ie. unbelievers desist in their unbelief."

Being the cool grandma like she is, she picked me up and took me. When we got back, some guy was looking through my car with his phone in his hand talking to someone. It was parked on a side street by a little league field.  I got out and asked him why he was doing and why he was looking through my car. Well grandma gets out of the car too. He explains he thought it looked suspicious and called the police. He asked why i left it there and as I was trying to explain what had happened, grandma chimes in and says ""Why dont you mind your own fucking buisness and get the fuck out of here.""   He looked dumbfounded and it was hilarious.  He was on the phone with the police during the whole thing and told them the owner came back and to disregard the call.  Another time a year or so back, she called me pussywhipped when i was to nice to decline a pair of my grandfather's old gym shorts and my mom kept saying no for me.   She was like ""why dont you let him speak for himself"""

Really easy schoolwork stressing me, or it should be hard, but I have zero motivation, me just being lazy more than anything really.  Having lots of trouble sleeping lately, no matter what time I go to bed. Also I can't cry even though I want to all the time, strange feels. Okay your guys turn."
wsgy,37ypi7,ignitablechief,6,Sun May 31 15:12:59 2015 UTC,Same

wsgy,37ypi7,ASS_KRACKERS,7,Sun May 31 15:34:33 2015 UTC,"yes running makes for a good feel afterwards. more people at wsgy.edu need exercise. no wonder half everyone here is depressed, they're sitting on their ass staring at a computer screen all day. go outside, get sunlight, go for a jog, walk the dog, go swimming.   it's hard at first but once you get in the habit of it and see positive results as far as your overall mood goes you'll never want to skip whatever the daily activity may be."
wsgy,37ypi7,1Cu14Cu,5,Sun May 31 20:55:36 2015 UTC,"Yeah, running is good for me because I can kinda see how I can get what I want, if I work for it. You see progress the longer you do it. And that's pretty great, because I feel like in lots of other things your hard work doesn't earn you what you want."

wsgy,37ypi7,Cespur,7,Sun May 31 21:05:32 2015 UTC,"First half of the week was busy an stressful, second half was still busy but better bc I went out with friends the past few nights. With how much I'm working I need to go out a few times a week to stay sane. A few nights ago I went to a coworkers party and most people there seemed chill. Nice to have some new people to hang out with.   Also got my first big paycheck from new job, and it was a nice piece of paper. Nice enough that I want to get my own place in the near future. Of course I'll need to save up for a few months, but I think I can do it by the end of the year."

wsgy,37xlyl,Decalance,10,Sun May 31 08:24:19 2015 UTC,this is not true sometimes you have a deep freeze in the basement for just this purpose and it will be kind of frosty because you onlyi use it for very arctic things

[4.21] And how can you take it when one of you has already gone in to the other and they have made with you a firm covenant? [4.22] And marry not woman whom your fathers married, except what has already passed; this surely is indecent and hateful, and it is an evil way. [4.23] Forbidden to you are your mothers and your daughters and your sisters and your paternal aunts and your maternal aunts and brothers' daughters and sisters' daughters and your mothers that have suckled you and your foster-sisters and mothers of your wives and your step-daughters who are in your guardianship, (born) of your wives to whom you have gone in, but if you have not gone in to them, there is no blame on you (in marrying them), and the wives of your sons who are of your own loins and that you should have two sisters together, except what has already passed; surely Allah is Forgiving, Merciful."

wsgy,37hwad,Rachat21,4,Wed May 27 20:55:41 2015 UTC,"A system image is basically a file that contains an entire operating system, files, configurations, installed programs, etc. I manage a few hundred computers at my job, so I have created a system image that has a set of programs pre-installed, all the Windows updates configured, things configured certain ways, etc so that I can quickly wipe and reinstall a computer and have it up and running very quickly. It takes me about an hour to wipe a computer and have it back up and running again with a full suite of software and everything preconfigured."
wsgy,37hwad,pureguavaa,3,Wed May 27 21:33:29 2015 UTC,That sounds badass
wsgy,37hwad,hgwaz,4,Wed May 27 23:17:16 2015 UTC,I use completely free tools and built in Windows software to do everything. I actually keep backups of my personal machine as system images too.

wsgy,37hwad,shannondoah,2,Thu May 28 12:56:42 2015 UTC,So what did you do after high school?
wsgy,37hwad,shannondoah,2,Thu May 28 12:58:00 2015 UTC,"Went to college. I got a degree in political science and was going to go to law school, but decided against that as the job market started changing and I realized most lawyers have shitty jobs. I managed a few political campaigns and started working at home transcribing and editing financial reports for publicly traded companies. Then I decided I wanted to move into IT work as it had always been interesting to me, and working with electronics was a hobby. I also wanted to go back to school. Here in Georgia if you work for the university system you can take up to 9 hours of classes for free every semester, so I started applying to tech jobs on campus as I did not want to take on any debt for graduate school. I got a low-end position being a helpdesk monkey, then got a better position in the helpdesk as one of the regular full-time staffers (making me benefits eligible) and started my Master's degree. Then I got a new job with this department basically managing all of their devices, computer labs, networking equipment etc"

wsgy,37ixod,1Cu14Cu,2,Wed May 27 23:35:24 2015 UTC,I used to see them a lot more when I was younger. I think they were a thing in the 80's. I have seen pink and sea foam colors.   One time at a drive in movie theater in Washington I came across a really strange toilet. I did not use it because I did not under stand it. I called other women over and we all tried to figure out what this strange toilet was. I took pics and sent them to friends. Turns out it was a female urinal. I tell you this story because if I came across a urinal made for women I have hope you will find your colored toilet.
wsgy,37ixod,JollyJudy,5,Thu May 28 00:06:57 2015 UTC,"I have only seen one colored toilet my entire life.   As for the women's urinal, that's something I have to see as well."

wsgy,36sw0c,nope_nic_tesla,5,Fri May 22 01:13:31 2015 UTC,"Shepherd's pie   Filling   1.5 lb ground meat of choice (lamb, beef, pork, turkey, etc)  Half a sweet white or yellow onion 2 cups mixed vegetables (I usually get a frozen mix of peas, carrots and corn)  2tbsp flour 2tbsp butter 1 cup beef stock (can use reconstituted beef bouillon)    Mashed Potato Topping   2 medium to large potatoes 4 tbsp butter  3 tbsp sour cream salt and pepper    Recipe  Pre-heat oven to 350 degrees.   Quarter the potatoes and boil in a large pot for 15 minutes.   While the potatoes are going, dice half a sweet onion and sweat in a skillet until translucent. If you are using frozen mixed vegetables throw those in too.   Brown ground meat in a skillet and drain excess fat.   While the meat is browning, make a gravy by first making a brown roux with 2tbsp flour and 2tbsp butter. Cook for a few minutes until it is a rich brown. Add the 1 cup of beef stock, mix and set aside until you're ready to assemble the pie. Don't thicken it quite yet.   When the potatoes are done, drain them and put in a large bowl. Mash or whip them with the butter and sour cream. Salt and pepper to taste. I also like to add some garlic or garlic powder sometimes.  Oil a 9 x 9 baking dish and add the meat on the bottom and top with the onion and vegetables layered on top.   Pour the gravy evenly over the dish. Top with mashed potatoes, trying to make an edge-to-edge seal on top of the filling.   Bake at 350 for 15-20 minutes until you can see the gravy starting to bubble up from underneath. Take out of the oven and turn on your broiler on high. Broil about 6 inches away from the top burner for 1-2 minutes. Keep an eye on it because the difference between done and burnt does not take very long.   Take it out and it should look like this"

wsgy,36i0p8,1Cu14Cu,11,Tue May 19 15:13:47 2015 UTC,"good bitstrip  New immigrants move to the low rent district and also tend to cater to their own demographics so that is at least where you can get the most ""authentic"" ethnic food. Personally I prefer americanized chinese to the real stuff but other than that authentic is almost always better imo. The Thai and Indian places around here suck ass because they tone down the spice and up the fat content to cater to midwesterners who don't actually like food"
wsgy,36i0p8,wsgy111,9,Tue May 19 17:55:17 2015 UTC,I find it hilarious that I can go to any Chinese buffet and get the same thing I got at another buffet across town

wsgy,36i0p8,nope_nic_tesla,10,Tue May 19 16:10:37 2015 UTC,Yes. I have a theory of ethnic food which is basically that the quality of an ethnic restaurant is directly proportional to how sketchy it looks.   There are two Mexican restaurants in my town that blow away all the other ones. One is attached to a gas station and the other one is next to a liquor store and across the street from a chicken plant.

wsgy,36hb4g,Cespur,9,Tue May 19 11:42:56 2015 UTC,Not that easy unless you actually have high income or collateral for them to make those loans on. After you take out a few loans they report it to all the credit agencies. Once your debt exceeds your income or assets by a certain amount nobody will loan you out anything anymore.
wsgy,36hb4g,nope_nic_tesla,3,Tue May 19 12:53:56 2015 UTC,lie about who you are :)
wsgy,36hb4g,nope_nic_tesla,2,Tue May 19 23:12:29 2015 UTC,How about you take a medium sized mortgage but instead of giving it to someone you just pack your bags and say hasta la vista baby  200/300k should get you a nice place in some Caribbean shithole
wsgy,36hb4g,nope_nic_tesla,2,Thu May 28 17:56:34 2015 UTC,The bank only finalizes the loan once the title deed has been transferred and it's paid to the seller. They don't just cut you a check and then you go buy a house
wsgy,36hb4g,hgwaz,2,Thu May 28 18:02:43 2015 UTC,so buy the house and then immediately sell it. OR!! rent it out for a small surcharge and use those 500 bucks a month or so to rent a cute house some place tropical
