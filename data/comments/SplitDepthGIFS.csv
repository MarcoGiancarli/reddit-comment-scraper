SplitDepthGIFS,3dkvf0,kushxmaster,3,Fri Jul 17 03:21:19 2015 UTC,"Ehhh, look..   Many posts in this sub have been achieving low quality except for the original high quality posters. I believe it's an event of how popular Split Depth as an idea has gotten.  Like, it's not this subreddit's fault that this got made here, but the creators sure didn't try very hard did they. It's like they just put the white bars over original advertising footage and tracked it assuming that's what people like   I find this issue in lots of [request]'s too. People requesting stuff that just cant be done due to length, nature or aspect of a scene that makes it impossible to do and look good"
SplitDepthGIFS,3dkvf0,ForceBlade,5,Fri Jul 17 06:56:24 2015 UTC,"It's because there's already a lot of debris covering the white lines, so the lines seem pretty far into the scene."

SplitDepthGIFS,3dcms5,noyfbfoad,2,Wed Jul 15 13:31:58 2015 UTC,"I put that left line on purpose. It's good to have the '3D' object go through different parts of the image in different depths, to increase the effect. Without the line or putting it in front only made the final portion of the gif boring.   Edit: the bat just misses the line the first time so it wouldn't take from the effect."

SplitDepthGIFS,3cu9w3,SargeantSasquatch,16,Sat Jul 11 00:03:48 2015 UTC,Digisuper 86 II seems to have been about $90k in 2010.

SplitDepthGIFS,3cu9w3,guinapo,0,Sat Jul 11 20:35:02 2015 UTC,It does. It clearly shatters the glass over the second line. It can't shatter a hole over the second line without crossing that line.

SplitDepthGIFS,3cb5gx,bebe13,50,Mon Jul 6 15:36:21 2015 UTC,Thanks! I shot as wide as I could (17mm) and had the bat end up as close to the lens as possible in order to create a magnification effect. Pretty happy with how it turned out.

SplitDepthGIFS,3cb5gx,Sventertainer,7,Mon Jul 6 20:16:52 2015 UTC,During my first few attempts at masking the bat the line break was extremely obvious. I decided to feather the mask a bit for the few frames where it breaks and that seemed to disguise it a lot better.

SplitDepthGIFS,3bm5sv,MagnarHD,31,Tue Jun 30 09:50:50 2015 UTC,A suggestion. Perhaps make the lines diagonal to the plane so that the plane passes through them rather than goes through them.  I think the effect could work well.

SplitDepthGIFS,3bm5sv,W0rldcrafter,10,Tue Jun 30 10:15:18 2015 UTC,Since the plane escapes the bounds of the gif I don't think any vertical lines are needed.
SplitDepthGIFS,3bm5sv,Dolfan0925,9,Tue Jun 30 15:02:12 2015 UTC,"Yeah it's not the line that creates the effect, the border is doing it in this case. The lines and/or borders tell the brain this is the boundary of the gif. When an object crosses over it that creates the effect. Passing right through the vertical line ruins the illusion. Unless you want to animate the vertical line breaking."

When adding white bars, one must assume it's a physical object, because it divides the foreground and the background. Any object that breaks through the line ruins the immersion and effect immediately because it fails our expectations.  The GTA one didn't need that line down the middle. It was probably added to appease some people, but it ruined the immersion right away. The white box however worked as intended.  There was one with the bartender. A use asked why the bartender isn't in front of the line. The bartender is part of the background, while the customer is the foreground. The drink is the actor that passes two planes, between the bartender and customer.  To everyone else. Don't be afraid to give honest critiques. It's a two way thing. Not giving a critique because you're afraid of hurting the artist only hurts the artist more in the long run. At the same time, it makes the critiques and future makers more aware of what they're looking at and/or working on.  You have to learn the rules before you can break them."

SplitDepthGIFS,3a7zfi,xylotism,2,Thu Jun 18 12:38:48 2015 UTC,"You know, I don't think they have to be! I think this is a great thickness for showcasing the depth, because I can tell very easily when they're behind or before without much of the action being blocked. It's possible this gif can get away with thinner lines than some because the anime drawing style makes different depths in the image more distinct, compared to a real life scene where there would be objects in the background at a variety of different distances."

Also have a mobile crew there for certain shots.  Step three: Hire Falconer.   Step four: Send hawk to do chase mouse.  Step five: Record the encounter.  Step six: Call the hawk back.

SplitDepthGIFS,3a46cn,Mortensen,6,Wed Jun 17 15:20:00 2015 UTC,It's implausible that a mouse could remain in sight of a diving hawk and outrun it.  A mouse never sees a hawk coming.

SplitDepthGIFS,3a46cn,Yackberg,1 point,Wed Jun 17 16:47:25 2015 UTC,"Wow amazing it's really hard to tell how they cut this scene together.   However after 2-3 reviews you can tell that the hawk and mouse were recorded separately. The hawk always is in his own part of the picture as is the mouse. On scenes showing both protagonists, you can ""see"" that those are two scenes merged together (with impressive editing skill though). It might get a little more obvious if you focus your eyes on the border where sharp foreground meets blurry background and the speed on which each part moves.  Very impressive though!!! Love it!!! The way this was recorded and merged together already kinda do the ""feel-of-depth""-trick though, imho."

SplitDepthGIFS,3a3wzu,dyolLkcaJ,3,Wed Jun 17 03:57:48 2015 UTC,yeah it was going on tumblr so I had to make it under 2mb which murdered the frame rate :/ depending on how much imgur can hold I can do it much better/longer/smoother
SplitDepthGIFS,3a3wzu,jesuriah,2,Wed Jun 17 05:21:38 2015 UTC,how do people have such quality gifs on Tumblr if they are under 2mb?
SplitDepthGIFS,3a3wzu,ZurichianAnimations,3,Wed Jun 17 06:32:48 2015 UTC,"High quality vids, most of the time they have short frame rates as well but scenes like this where the action happens quickly yet still has a lot of frames ( the moving backround is what gave this a lot of frames) aren't that good to make gifs under 2mb from cause as you can see here it just looks frame-skippy lol I don't know how to explain it better but I hope it makes sense"

SplitDepthGIFS,3a3wzu,UsePreparationH,1 point,Wed Jun 17 07:44:53 2015 UTC,Try something like a webm video instead. Since webm uses modern codecs you can fit alot more in 2MB than you can with GIF. webm is whats used by gyphy and imgur's gifv

Here's the instructions from the sidebar.  How to Make a Split Depth GIF   Open it in Photoshop, find the animation toolbar.(Window➤Animation) Click on first frame in animation window and find the active layer in layers toolbar. Make a new, empty layer above active layer, draw the white lines in it. Copy the white lines layers above each frame. (about 50 additional layers in this GIF.) With eraser tool, remove white lines from parts where the object overlaps them. Make sure that the right white lines layer is activated for each frame.

SplitDepthGIFS,38sytd,WulfTek,67,Sat Jun 6 15:34:43 2015 UTC,You chose a ridiculously hard one for your first gif. Having two different levels (the near fighter and the far fighter) both crossing the lines at appropriate times gives this incredibly effective depth.

The fly landed in front of him, he quickly got behind it. As the fly would turn, he stayed behind it so it couldn't see him. He'd only move when the fly was cleaning it's hands. Then, when the fly took off, he jumped into a half inch or so and grabbed it, landed on his back, holding the fly, and bit the little bastard.  So damn cool.  I'm glad there aren't big spiders...or dinosaurs."

SplitDepthGIFS,386s0l,THLycanthrope,5,Tue Jun 2 16:29:13 2015 UTC,Easy and subtle fix would be to have the back of the house be behind the lines.
SplitDepthGIFS,386s0l,Hammerhart,1 point,Tue Jun 2 11:53:57 2015 UTC,"That's what I was going for originally (so it would look like the white lines were at the midpoint between the front and back of the house), but the house face also rotates a bit and overall I just couldn't get it to look right."

SplitDepthGIFS,386s0l,protestor,26,Tue Jun 2 23:22:06 2015 UTC,"Nice try. But the lines are behind the man and the house. It's already established he's in the foreground so the lines don't do anything.   Maybe try putting the lines in front of the mans body. And when the house moves, the front of it will pass in front of the lines whilst the back of the house will go behind the lines.   Edit: An even simpler fix, like /u/THLycanthrope suggested, is to keep the lines where they are but to make the back of the house pass behind them."
SplitDepthGIFS,386s0l,Profanex,8,Tue Jun 2 10:15:13 2015 UTC,The trouble is that there is no object passing through a line (going from background to foreground or vice versa)

SplitDepthGIFS,35r5op,Oberus,19,Tue May 12 20:50:01 2015 UTC,Its really well done nice work. Have you tried putting the bar higher to make it look like he goes through it?
SplitDepthGIFS,35r5op,nukedhunter,25,Tue May 12 22:05:31 2015 UTC,Wouldn't that break the illussion of depth if we see something pass through the bar?
SplitDepthGIFS,35r5op,alienfrog,18,Tue May 12 22:12:03 2015 UTC,"I wish more people understood this. The bar shouldn't have an object pass through it. That pulls us out of the illusion so quickly. The object should start behind it, then as it moves forward, show that it is on top by overlapping the bar. But never through. It never looks as good."
SplitDepthGIFS,35r5op,Sleightly-Magical,6,Wed May 13 02:35:02 2015 UTC,"It seems there's not really a consensus about this. I agree entirely, I hate it when the bars are broken, it destroys any illusion."
SplitDepthGIFS,35r5op,Plastonick,10,Wed May 13 07:59:30 2015 UTC,I think that's what causes the illusion of depth.
SplitDepthGIFS,35r5op,GingerHero,11,Tue May 12 22:28:21 2015 UTC,"I think it would break it. The object has to go over or around the bar to show it's travelling. If the object went through the bar there would only be a difference of one frame, where in the previous frame the object is in the distance and then suddenly in the next frame its in the foreground. It would seem like it's teleporting."
SplitDepthGIFS,35r5op,Cylus923,4,Tue May 12 22:37:33 2015 UTC,"I think /u/nukedhunter is still right though. Overlap has to happen at some point, and there isn't quite enough here. Needs more overlap. Either before or after.   I would maybe put the bar just under the bug, looks like whatever this critter is jumps high enough that there wouldn't be any through the bar action"
SplitDepthGIFS,35r5op,Strixxi,1 point,Wed May 13 04:24:37 2015 UTC,"Ah. I was trying to find differnt ones that went through the line and you're right, it really is just one frame. Good call"

SplitDepthGIFS,35r5op,Wrinklestiltskin,7,Wed May 13 12:21:30 2015 UTC,"After reading through the comments today morning, I decided to tweak it a little bit.   https://gfycat.com/VioletWindyJellyfish  Any opinions?"
SplitDepthGIFS,35r5op,Section37,9,Wed May 13 12:21:08 2015 UTC,"Man I don't think it's you but this just isn't doing it for me... I thought the original untouched gif had more of an effect. Obviously other people see it though. It's crazy how differently these effect people. I'll see just as many people say ""this is amazing"" as ""this is crap"" in comments on this sub. I think it has to do with differences in our brain's pattern recognition."
SplitDepthGIFS,35r5op,Plastonick,5,Wed May 13 12:45:11 2015 UTC,Preferred the original. Breaking the bar on the back-hop ruins the illusion for me (I'm firmly in the object-should-go-around-not-through-the-bar camp).

SplitDepthGIFS,35bls2,Buttcheeks_Sampson,17,Fri May 8 19:50:36 2015 UTC,the camera pans down showing the boxer laying down and kinda ruins the effect after the end of the gif. Would just slowing it down make it more convincing?

SplitDepthGIFS,35bls2,TeaGuru,5,Sat May 9 18:08:56 2015 UTC,The ones that really do it for me are the ones where the split depth image is made a bit smaller than the original and the movement actually leaves into the space outside the image.
SplitDepthGIFS,35bls2,prchm,3,Fri May 8 21:05:35 2015 UTC,You did about the best you could with that gif.  Maybe have the rope at the very beginning break the line on the left
SplitDepthGIFS,35bls2,skolrageous,1 point,Sat May 9 01:37:50 2015 UTC,My thoughts exactly
SplitDepthGIFS,35bls2,Baschoen23,3,Sat May 9 02:37:23 2015 UTC,there is very little line break on left so i would try a bit closer together
SplitDepthGIFS,35bls2,fatty_fatshits,3,Sat May 9 05:26:40 2015 UTC,"lines closer to the action, and thinner too."
SplitDepthGIFS,35bls2,mitch13815,3,Sat May 9 06:41:54 2015 UTC,Make the bars thinner so there's less separation.
SplitDepthGIFS,35bls2,j4390jamie,3,Sat May 9 14:06:29 2015 UTC,At the beginning the rope should be in front of the white line

He was like an unbeatable monster, and the only one who really beat Mike was himself. Even he says he didn't respect the people he lost to, and so didn't train properly leading him to defeat, which became a downward spiral of drama depression and financial issues."
SplitDepthGIFS,357ah4,avelertimetr,1 point,Fri May 8 13:32:22 2015 UTC,"I kind of feel like that fight showed that these guys are just too small for the kind of hype their fight got and for the kind of money they got.  If they're bigger boxers, they're stronger and the potential for knockdowns, knockouts, and just plain big punches is greater.  Those are the only fighters who should get the big paydays.  The next time 2 great fighters come along who are small, we should expect that it's going to be a rather boring fight."
SplitDepthGIFS,357ah4,subwade,1 point,Fri May 8 18:25:23 2015 UTC,"Wow, this guy is an absolute monster.

My favorite part is that you have the concept correct that the objects should move over the bars, not through them. Maybe next time make the right bar a bit thinner to give it the view of it being further."
SplitDepthGIFS,357ah4,jimworksatwork,2,Fri May 8 00:18:04 2015 UTC,You can see where Mike calculated that blow.. Fuck.
SplitDepthGIFS,357ah4,robase81,1 point,Thu May 7 20:58:38 2015 UTC,When you watch the fights it's scary how fast Mike actually CHOOSES his punches. He was so fucking fast sometimes.

Also, I finished the story line once and then modded it with the infinite jet parachute and unlimited ammo mods so that made it much more fun and less frustrating.    But, you are going to be blowing up the same things over and over.  That never goes away.  If it's not your cup of tea then I'm not sure modding will help."
SplitDepthGIFS,352mzj,mavirick,18,Wed May 6 16:18:29 2015 UTC,"They should never pass 'through' the stripes, it breaks the illusion, the only time it works is when there is a white border and the object passes to the top of it."

SplitDepthGIFS,32eb2m,pfafulous,17,Mon Apr 13 03:10:53 2015 UTC,Only reason was that the clip is so dark that it almost bleaches out the image. Well that was my thought on it..
SplitDepthGIFS,32eb2m,SarahC,17,Mon Apr 13 03:14:17 2015 UTC,"The entire point of the split depth GIF is convincing your brain that the white bar is part of your computer screen rather than part of the image. Then, when the subject appears in front of the bar, your brain understands that as being in front of the screen and thus coming out of the screen at you. Using the gray bars just has the same effect as Mama say bursting through a door at you in the movie. Spooky scary, but not split depth, not as much as the white."

SplitDepthGIFS,326vtx,Fuqor,20,Sat Apr 11 02:22:20 2015 UTC,If the bow is behind the left bar and the arrow flies between the bars and into the walker's head it would make way more sense. Perhaps slow it down the moment he fires to give more time for the effect to take hold on the viewers mind.
SplitDepthGIFS,326vtx,Synnerrs,35,Sat Apr 11 04:23:26 2015 UTC,It doesn't make sense really. Daryl's bow crossing the white bars implies that it stretched all the way to the same plane as the walkers head.
SplitDepthGIFS,326vtx,Toastalicious_,8,Sat Apr 11 03:50:19 2015 UTC,I normally make one bar slightly behind the other. I guess i'm wrong in doing so.

It nailed the comic book style and it handled emotion superbly. Fair enough they skimped out with Goblin and Rhino, but that stuff was mostly for Sinister Six... which we might never see.   Prepares for epic downvote into Oblivion :P"
SplitDepthGIFS,3221z8,Khalexus,6,Fri Apr 10 12:39:12 2015 UTC,"That movie gets so much hate, but I really enjoyed it. I do understand some of the complaints people have about it, but I just don't understand why it's so overwhelmingly looked down upon. It's much better than a shitload of blockbusters that come out, yet even those movies that are acknowledged as being shit, don't cop anywhere near as much flak as ASM2. That recent Transformer movie... With the dinosaurs and stuff? Possibly one of the worst movies I've ever seen in the cinema, but you don't hear it get anywhere close to the amount of flak ASM2 gets.   I don't mean to get ranty, but I just don't really understand it. And I'm sad that it's likely not going to continue, because of this.   As for the best superhero movie I've seen... I feel like I'd probably give that to Guardians."

SplitDepthGIFS,30xsn9,Geekos,14,Tue Mar 31 17:18:41 2015 UTC,"from the wikki   Based on the examination of 130 specimens and of beaks found inside sperm whales, giant squids' mantles are not known to exceed 2.25 m (7.4 ft).[14] Including the head and arms, but excluding the tentacles, the length very rarely exceeds 5 m (16 ft).[14] Maximum total length, when measured relaxed post mortem, is estimated at 13 m (43 ft) for females and 10 m (33 ft) for males from the posterior fins to the tip of the two long tentacles.[14]"

SplitDepthGIFS,2zxxaq,RJPennyweather,15,Mon Mar 23 03:07:51 2015 UTC,Louis has stated repeatedly that the movie he wrote and the movie he was forced to make are two completely different things.

I still like the movie though.  I imagine it would have been a lot more awesome if Louis maintained control of it through to the end.  I also heard that his experience with Pootie Tang is why he got the deal he has with his current TV show.  The deal is, give me some money and I'll give you a TV show.  You (FX) are not allowed to have any input on the creative process.  He got away with asking for this deal by only asking for a relatively small amount of money."

SplitDepthGIFS,2zzjkd,Atrapenna,2,Mon Mar 23 11:27:03 2015 UTC,"hmmm I think if someone had the patience, you could do single pixel lines with opacity and 1px gaps and get a 3d effect because the masked object would be going over the lines and if done right it would look like monitor lines. Does that make sense in my wording?"
SplitDepthGIFS,2zzjkd,brihamedit,3,Sun Mar 29 19:06:45 2015 UTC,Blur might be an option if properly done.
SplitDepthGIFS,2zzjkd,greatdominions,2,Mon Mar 23 20:35:07 2015 UTC,"This may not be the answer you're looking for but it can work with a white border around the gif instead of lines through it. It looks a little more ""realistic"" than having two random white lines. For example.  And sometimes, it can work without the lines. For example this would still work even without the lines (the comments replace the white lines).  The optical illusion is the object is coming out of your screen, so some sort of white line/border is necessary (or, in the cat's case, the comments.) Someone posted this as an example, but I don't think it works as well. The bars still look like they are within the scene."

SplitDepthGIFS,2zzjkd,Fuqor,1 point,Mon Apr 13 06:29:13 2015 UTC,Ah ok must have read wrong. But I doubt it would work. When it's flat over the comments it doesn't really pop looks more like a 2d image.
SplitDepthGIFS,2zzjkd,greatdominions,1 point,Mon Apr 13 11:16:17 2015 UTC,The point is that the cat jumps up onto the comments. The bars are really doing nothing that the comments section isn't already doing.
SplitDepthGIFS,2zzjkd,Fuqor,1 point,Tue Apr 14 05:22:58 2015 UTC,I'm not sure I beg to differ. The white lines give it a break to that level. Once the cat passes them although only slightly covering the lines it gives it a stronger effect than if it just jumped onto the comment section.
SplitDepthGIFS,2zzjkd,reddell,1 point,Tue Apr 14 13:25:28 2015 UTC,"So just the original gif? Are you asking about other ways of creating the illusion of depth? All there is is white lines, that's the whole thing, without that it's just a regular gif... You can't create depth without doing anything to the image."
SplitDepthGIFS,2zzjkd,Coliformist,1 point,Wed Apr 8 13:15:17 2015 UTC,You could do a sort of faux parallax effect with background blurring.

SplitDepthGIFS,2zrn2n,Poromenos,10,Sat Mar 21 11:01:43 2015 UTC,"I can answer this from a personal perspective!  I didn't start pole vault until I was 18 which is later than many people. I had already come from a background of long-jump which is similar to pole vault in the take-off technique so I started with a small advantage.  The way we started was by first only doing a 3 stride run, with a small pole and holding low on the stick. Just to practice committing to a jump and landing the pole in the box, a metal target thing in the ground. After this phase you work on your ""rock-back"" which is when you drop you shoulders and get your feet about your head. If you get these two steps you generally get to move back on the runway, use larger sticks at higher grips. And get to practice vaulting over a bungee cord.  This is a huge crash course description of vault, there's more technique involved but this should hopefully answer any remaining questions you had.  Edit: it was also initially created by jumping over rivers with sticks in Europe I believe. Otherwise Wikipedia should be able to help."
SplitDepthGIFS,2zrn2n,WOWEY_MACARONI,3,Sat Mar 21 15:17:25 2015 UTC,"Aha, yes, this clarifies things, thanks! It makes sense that you'd start low first."
SplitDepthGIFS,2zrn2n,Poromenos,11,Sat Mar 21 15:47:09 2015 UTC,"I threw shot put and discus on my high school track team, and all of the pole vaulters I knew pretty much started in middle school or early high school. I don't know much other than what I saw with their training, but the heights they can clear at first are much shorter than more skilled vaulters. So I assume that means they use shorter poles to begin with, and as they gain experience they work their way up."
SplitDepthGIFS,2zrn2n,jtpo95,2,Sat Mar 21 12:50:09 2015 UTC,"Ah, thanks, that makes sense."
SplitDepthGIFS,2zrn2n,Poromenos,2,Sat Mar 21 14:23:55 2015 UTC,"I pole vaulted in high school and college.  In addition to what others said below, we also had a training pole which was like the regular poles except it was filled with foam.  This allowed for it to bend a lot slower so it would still work if you came in to slow.  On my team, most guys used it for a couple practices when starting and either moved to a regular pole or quit.    There's a certain mild insanity required for the sport, so if you aren't comfortable committing to the full speed charge on the box, you're probably not cut out for it.  That being said, it was my favorite sport from school."

SplitDepthGIFS,2zp3b8,Asmor,4,Fri Mar 20 14:40:32 2015 UTC,Such heroic nonsense.
SplitDepthGIFS,2zp3b8,SuperVoodoo,35,Fri Mar 20 16:39:16 2015 UTC,This doesn't work at all. Like not even a bit.
SplitDepthGIFS,2zp3b8,jago1996,4,Fri Mar 20 16:12:24 2015 UTC,I agree.  Good effort but its like theyre walking through the lines like they are doors.
SplitDepthGIFS,2zp3b8,Import,2,Fri Mar 20 17:42:07 2015 UTC,The sliding sideways makes it look weird to me.

I'll admit that not all of the effects are apparent but I disagree that it ""doesn't work at all.""  I'll gladly accept constructive criticism on how it could be improved but it's hard to really do anything about it when all you're offering is just some shitty negative remark."
SplitDepthGIFS,2zp3b8,I_HaveAHat,3,Fri Mar 20 16:19:45 2015 UTC,It makes no sense for something to be in front of one white bar but behind the other. The two white bars are meant to be very close to us and side by side
SplitDepthGIFS,2zp3b8,I_HaveAHat,1 point,Fri Mar 20 19:03:20 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure what you are saying, can you please clarify?

SplitDepthGIFS,2zp3b8,I_HaveAHat,1 point,Mon Mar 23 14:06:27 2015 UTC,"Its best when they break through both white lines not just one. Otherwise its doesn't seem like its coming at us so much, but instead it seems like we're at a weird angle with the side by side white lines"

SplitDepthGIFS,2zp3b8,seattleandrew,1 point,Mon Mar 23 14:23:05 2015 UTC,"Sorry I misunderstood what you were saying. Yes I think it's best when the lines aren't broken. What I meant was things should pass both lines at once, not just one."

SplitDepthGIFS,2zp3b8,Heliosthefour,3,Mon Mar 23 14:36:17 2015 UTC,I would say that camera panning/movement breaks the effect. The last one (purple) seemed to be one of the better produced effects.
SplitDepthGIFS,2zp3b8,jago1996,1 point,Sat Mar 21 00:22:18 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I figured so but wanted to try to see sometimes when I don't really notice any effect, it works for others and vice versa."

SplitDepthGIFS,2zaaq0,RogerDeanVenture,12,Mon Mar 16 22:57:54 2015 UTC,Ya I thought they did a really good job on it.
SplitDepthGIFS,2zaaq0,Wrinklestiltskin,4,Mon Mar 16 23:16:45 2015 UTC,Wait... So this is an undoctored ad? Or did you make the ad split depth?  If split depth gifs become a major advertising component that will be pretty interesting.
SplitDepthGIFS,2zaaq0,Gunslinger_,6,Tue Mar 17 18:46:19 2015 UTC,"Undoctored. It came straight from their instagram page. I just downloaded it and put it on gfycat. I think it's can be a really cool idea for advertisement, especially if they do it right like this one."
SplitDepthGIFS,2zaaq0,krashmania,48,Tue Mar 17 19:00:08 2015 UTC,"If they're going to have the glass cross the outside white border (which works well), then it shouldn't cross the middle line while on the way there, imo."

SplitDepthGIFS,2zaaq0,adamdevigili,3,Mon Mar 16 23:36:59 2015 UTC,"I agree with you, but I think in all circumstances it shouldn't pass through the line. The line is a frame in 3D space, you shouldn't break the frame, but pass through it."

SplitDepthGIFS,2zaaq0,DtotheOUG,2,Tue Mar 17 18:47:09 2015 UTC,I can hear the glass sliding on the bar.
SplitDepthGIFS,2zaaq0,supergalactic,5,Tue Mar 17 21:58:35 2015 UTC,"Constructive Criticism: 1. Get rid of the bar in the middle. Having it go off the ""edge"" perfectly gets the 3D effect across. 2. Cut the gif short so the hand never appears to grab it. The dismembered hand throws it all off.    EDIT: Fantastic gif though. One of the best I've seen."
SplitDepthGIFS,2zaaq0,were_elephant,0,Tue Mar 17 04:50:47 2015 UTC,I guarantee that the ad agency tried it with and without the white bar and determined that the illusion was stronger with the white bar.

SplitDepthGIFS,2zaaq0,sextc,2,Mon Mar 16 23:35:28 2015 UTC,I agree. On one hand it's nice that it's in every bar. On the other I have to keep sending drinks back because it's in a shot glass instead of a short tumbler.

SplitDepthGIFS,2z9jab,gaylordqueen69,-18,Mon Mar 16 22:54:06 2015 UTC,"Either the article is full of shit or Facebook or Jameson, but they are claiming they invented split depth gifs and theirs is the first ever."
SplitDepthGIFS,2z9jab,Podunk14,15,Mon Mar 16 19:27:00 2015 UTC,No they're not. They're claiming to be the first to use the style in an ad on FB and Instagram.
SplitDepthGIFS,2z9jab,getborn,2,Mon Mar 16 19:40:15 2015 UTC,"Anyone else reading this ""Jameson says it has created the first 3-D video ad for Facebook and Instagram, using a technique that makes it appear as if a bartender is sliding a whiskey shot your way."" could easily be forgiven for thinking that they created split depth gifs though as that's kind of how it comes across."

Then this gets uploaded  (and it looks great), and no one complains.  Sometimes, I just don't get reddit.  Edit: shit was not lost, I thought I was downvoted much more than what I was on the other post.  I didn't mean to sound so aggressive, so sorry about that."
SplitDepthGIFS,2yxi3e,iambeard,1 point,Sat Mar 14 15:34:37 2015 UTC,"Nothing should ever pass through the depth lines is the thing. It's supposed to go around, over, above. Never through. This split gif is also breaking the rules and I am also surprised no one has said anything.  Edit: realizing I was the person that ""lost my shit"" to you in the other post (that's exaggerated a bit isn't it?) I don't think you quite understand how a split gif is supposed to work. I just wrote out a whole lengthy explanation but I think it may help to imagine the bars like jail bars and the gif is within the ""jail cell."" The object in the gif is supposed to pass through the bars, not break them. Breaking them ruins the effect. This one is extremely well done (as is the other gif I commented to you on) because it treats the bars as objects that cannot break. This one is not because Taylor passes through the bars like a goddamn magician. It could have been better if they were vertical and it acted as ""doorway"" she was dancing through. Get it?"
SplitDepthGIFS,2yxi3e,greatdominions,-1,Sun Mar 15 02:54:24 2015 UTC,"Lose their shit is probably inaccurate, but I'm really not following your logic for the bars.  The bars are only to express a fixed depth point.  Objects temporarily passing through those lines do no ruin the effect, and in fact, better demonstrates which parts of an object are beyond the depth that the bars are positioned at.  The bars should be understood as outside of the image, not jail bars.  This will probably boil down to a matter of opinion, but I fail to see how the effect is ruined."
SplitDepthGIFS,2yxi3e,cocksuckingfaggotry,0,Sun Mar 15 03:59:11 2015 UTC,"I don't think it's a matter of opinion and I think you're wrong. :) It's an optical illusion. The illusion is thrown away when the bars are ""broken"" and passed through. If for example, in the Taylor Swift gif, she was dancing in front of the bars the whole time, and the party scene was behind the bars - fine, it works. Because the bars are treated as real, as part of the scenery.  Furthermore, if the bars are supposed to be understood as outside the image, how does it make sense for objects to magically pass through them? That integrates them into the image and the effect is no longer 3D. The bars are supposed to be fixed objects themselves. For example, the top gif on this subreddit shows a cat jumping up onto the ""comments"" of the gif. The bars are an extension of those comments. The cat is jumping out of its own world, into the audience's world, on top of the comments/bars. Imagine if it just jumped through the comments/bars. It would indeed, ruin the illusion."

They grow to 30–90 cm (0.98–2.95 ft) long, and their distinctive first dorsal fins take the form of a modified oval, sucker-like organ with slat-like structures that open and close to create suction and take a firm hold against the skin of larger marine animals.  By sliding backward, the remora can increase the suction, or it can release itself by swimming forward. Remoras sometimes attach to small boats. They swim well on their own, with a sinuous, or curved, motion.    Image i - Some remoras, such as this Echeneis naucrates, may attach themselves to scuba divers.

When the car flips over Martin Lawrence's head and breaks the bars, the illusion of depth doesn't really work. Don't know if it's just me. It's a cool effect, but I think it has to deal with both of the bars breaking at the same time?"

SplitDepthGIFS,2y4wyd,Mancaveaccount,0,Sat Mar 7 09:34:31 2015 UTC,You lost some points for not having bars in the internal shots; but you gained a few for making the flying car break the top of the bars.
SplitDepthGIFS,2y4wyd,corbygray528,-1,Fri Mar 6 17:29:14 2015 UTC,....why not have the Ferrari shatter the line in the beginning as well? Really weird that it just transports through it
SplitDepthGIFS,2y4wyd,Mancaveaccount,2,Fri Mar 6 16:12:33 2015 UTC,Because after the ferrari goes through there are still scenes that use the lines. After the car shattered the lines that was the last of the splidepth segments.
SplitDepthGIFS,2y4wyd,kushxmaster,1 point,Fri Mar 6 16:22:32 2015 UTC,"The lines already disappear when we cut to Martin Lawrence, they're not continuous through the whole gif (the shattered remnants also disappear when we cut to Will in the fourth shot) so it wouldn't matter if they came back whole in the third shot.   Split depth is also meant to add depth to a scene, this gif (while cool) isn't really split depth at all.   this is a perfect example of how you're suppose to use the lines to add depth to the scene, OP use of the lines doesn't do that at all."

SplitDepthGIFS,2y15s1,dino-sour,29,Thu Mar 5 21:15:26 2015 UTC,"Haha, that does actually ring true. Seems to work in the context for an absurd ""break the fourth wall"" presentation of this illusion."

Eliminating the right-side content wouldn't really add much, but eliminating the left side would give an added affect of the arm busting out of the frame.  There would be an opportunity cost by uncentering Groot. I might expect that it sort of disrupts the balance of the gif and may lessen the surprise factor of the pop out. I looked into testing it, but it'd take too much time for me to cut around the arm in the flattened layers of the gif.  If /u/hero0fwar still had the original .psd it might be mere seconds of work depending on how he masked the original masterpiece. But he's probably busy beating on /u/preggit."

SplitDepthGIFS,2xxuup,mubashir1337,4,Thu Mar 5 00:33:37 2015 UTC,"It's changed up in the movie universe as Hank Pym hasn't been introduced yet. Makes more sense in the MCU if Tony was the one who created Ultron.   However, in the synopsis, it says he awakens a dormant peacekeeping program, maybe hinting a younger Hank Pym created it and then left it alone. Tony finds the program and uses it to help the Avengers and the rest is history."

SplitDepthGIFS,2x73t7,_jamiegilder,2,Thu Feb 26 04:11:06 2015 UTC,"You need to have your white bars layer on top of whatever layer it is you want to edit.

Then, for the parts of the source video where the line breaks occur, you'll need a duplicate of your standard for each frame that you need to change.  Edit: I noticed in the image you posted, your white bar layer is at the bottom. You want to move that to very top in order for it to show across all the frames. For the frames where the line breaks occur, you need to turn off visibility and have a duplicate white bar layer for that specific frame for you to edit."

I actually attended a talk with one of the stereoscopic artists on this film and he said that ""most didn't notice it"". I know I noticed at the cinema, and it's even more jarring here without the glasses.  They did it slightly better in Mockingjay where they slowly moved the bars up and down in anticipation of the scene, even hiding it with using slightly darker shots. It was as they were risen into the arena, but can't remember exactly what they had go out of the screen."

SplitDepthGIFS,2wl93c,DryEagle,88,Fri Feb 20 21:28:16 2015 UTC,"The main problem I see in doing something like this would be that the camera moves at the same rate as Franco, so there's no real change in depth that could be emphasized by adding the lines."
SplitDepthGIFS,2wl93c,XanMan11,23,Fri Feb 20 22:06:47 2015 UTC,Imagine he is walking into a white hallway. Decrease the size of the white box and it should give the illusion that he walks towards the camera.

SplitDepthGIFS,2wgcpa,TheRagingRavioli,4,Fri Feb 20 00:16:49 2015 UTC,"Basically, but the thing that makes or breaks them is the fact that you have to decide what is background and foreground and when that transition should happen/match the transition with the speed of the object"

SplitDepthGIFS,2w2c0q,Shosray,5,Mon Feb 16 13:44:24 2015 UTC,I think the lines should be a little closer together and the one on the right should be thinner so it looks like it's more forward from the other one.

SplitDepthGIFS,2vq7ee,ctmedic,6,Fri Feb 13 09:50:12 2015 UTC,"No, I used this as a test case to learn automatic motion tracking in After Effects. I had the idea when I saw the camera pan left at first, then stop and focus. I thought it might look more natural, somehow making the white line part of the scene. I think it kind of worked, but I want to try to make the tracking even smoother if I can figure it out.  Thanks for noticing!"

I think it works pretty well, but as with all of these, you really can't know until you try it.  I thought this source clip worked well with the principles I outlined -- smaller to bigger (toward the camera) and some kind of left-right or up-down motion in order to break in front of the line.

SplitDepthGIFS,2vma5h,viperex,14,Thu Feb 12 06:44:15 2015 UTC,"I was gonna say I thought it was both distracting and didn't create the intended effect, but looking at it again a few times it really worked."
SplitDepthGIFS,2vma5h,moonra_zk,5,Thu Feb 12 13:38:30 2015 UTC,"I don't think it worked at all. Look at the original, it's just a really cool gif, I feel like the bars in this added nothing but distraction."
SplitDepthGIFS,2vma5h,Never-On-Reddit,4,Thu Feb 12 15:52:19 2015 UTC,The original gif looks like it doesn't even need the bars to achieve the desired effect. I gave it a second chance but it's still distracting. Maybe if the background was moving as well?
SplitDepthGIFS,2vma5h,viperex,5,Thu Feb 12 18:25:05 2015 UTC,If you completely ignore the white bars you'll see that the effect is achieved through clever use of letterboxing rather than the white bars.
SplitDepthGIFS,2vma5h,Ignizzz,3,Thu Feb 12 21:07:00 2015 UTC,"Here's a version without the white bars. It's been really interesting to read all of the comments - some people love it, some think it was awful. (owlful?sorry ) I think this version definitely still works and has merit, although IMO the white bars help to bring the illusion in a moment earlier, and help to amplify it further. Also, to me it feels like the bars help to divert attention away from some of the rougher roto edges, which become more apparent in this bars-free version. Even so, it seems to work either way, and it raises an important question about which method would look better to the majority of viewers.   In the OP version, I included the initial foreground pass of the white bars to sell it even more, by providing a foreground sweep over the owl, followed by the pass in the background to help punch it more into the ""3D"" space. Another option might be to eliminate the first pass of the bars and just show the background bars sliding in when the owl gets closer to the viewer.   I had also experimented with a version where the background white bars came in behind the letterboxing, but that didn't work well.   Any way you look at it, this has been a great learning experience for me. I'm pretty intrigued by this illusion and I'm planning on making a whole split depth video. I'll definitely be referring to this thread's comments and feedback as I start that edit.  EDIT: I went ahead and rendered out versions of the ""second bars only"" and ""bars behind letterboxing"" versions that I mentioned so that everyone can see what they look like."

SplitDepthGIFS,2vjq5z,encompassion,1 point,Wed Feb 11 20:07:03 2015 UTC,It's the general consensus that slower>fast due to issues with motion blur screwing up the effect. You are correct in that a poorly done slow sdg is very distracting at that point.

SplitDepthGIFS,2vlfal,Merle55,3,Thu Feb 12 01:46:35 2015 UTC,Is naurto worth the watch?  In terms of db and dbz filler how bad is narutos?
SplitDepthGIFS,2vlfal,Vivo999,2,Thu Feb 12 04:02:27 2015 UTC,"First series (Just Naruto, no shippuden) is definitely worth it. Not many fillers. The fillers are mainly just like...the last third which you can completely ignore.  Shippuden isn't awful but...it's found ways to add padding without fillers which arguably make it worse. In the later episodes they will repeat the same flash backs over and over and over and it literally devalues those flash backs/moments, as well as it being way too obvious what they're trying to do. If you don't mind skipping over this stuff it's not so bad.  I watched the original Naruto as a kid and loved it. Finally I stopped when they had the 3 year or plus filler arc and didn't return until many years later. When I eventually came back to Shippuden I basically skipped through any slow parts because there was just so many characters and so many seemingly meaningless plot points (also again...they have unnecessary padding). Most people don't watch anime like this and I've only ever done it with Naruto, but with all of that said I would say it's 100% worth it. I loved Naruto, Shippuden was ""meh"" to me for the first half but has finally been finding it's roots again, and I look forward to finishing the series.  With all of THAT said though, I just recommend you watch all of Hunter x Hunter 2011 instead. No fillers, super kick ass, and...no fillers. Or padding. (Technically there are 2 recap episodes but these are immediately obvious and can be skipped)"

SplitDepthGIFS,2vj8d8,npinguy,5,Wed Feb 11 15:18:43 2015 UTC,I feel like if he moved the bar on the right just a little further right so he kinda steps between to the other side of the bars instead of straight through them then the effect could be enhanced. Because of the way Leo's left shoulder moves to the right juuuust slightly I'd imagine you could create the effect that way. I'm fairly new around here though and I'm not a photowizard  so maybe I'm wrong.

I think it illustrates my point about choosing source material, however -- these really need left and right (or up and down) motion to work as well as smaller to bigger.

Although that would effectively bring the entire visible dog in front of the lines, the good work at the moving mouth & teeth keep the effect working.

SplitDepthGIFS,2v6h4u,FarleyFinster,2,Sun Feb 8 20:34:35 2015 UTC,On of the big things that always comes from this is images posted on imgur. Part of the user agreement is that imgur owns the rights to the pictures. There was a similar situation a few months ago when ESPN used a graph someone made and uploaded to imgur to post on the nfl sub.
SplitDepthGIFS,2v6h4u,Purdaddy,3,Sun Feb 8 22:39:10 2015 UTC,"Part of the user agreement is that imgur owns the rights to the pictures.   No! This is NOT what they claim and even if it was, it's not actually what the law allows for. Imgur actually has a really good terms of service agreement: first you confirm that you have the rights to anything you write or upload including the rights to distribute. That indemnifies them -- they're off the hook when Hegre comes a-knockin' about all those ripped-off galleries.  The very next thing is plain text, nearly void of lawyerese, explaining that your uploading pics or text gives imgur the right to further distribute it. They themselves limit this, saying it's non-exclusive (you can sell the rights to someone else) and more importantly, they agree this can be terminated by you. The next line prevents them getting screwed by ex post facto if you do in fact revoke their license by deleting the images/content.  That's it. That's what you're misunderstanding. I don't know about the ESPN kerfuffle -- first I've heard of it -- but if it went the way you say, then ESPN is into the creator who can demand watever he wants unless he put up some CC license on his account (can you do that on imgur?) and screwed up.  However -- there's almost always a ""however"" -- the very simple terms imgur has means that neither the guy who made the graph nor ESPN can drag imgur into their pissing match. They can join if they want, maybe even send an amicus, but they gots no horse in that or any other race."
SplitDepthGIFS,2v6h4u,FarleyFinster,-2,Sun Feb 8 23:01:39 2015 UTC,"I am not a Lawyer, my lawyer told me I had too much integrity to venture into the field.  That being said, as I have read the link, the case of Basic Books Vs. Kinkos does not support what you said.   ""The distinction between common-law protection for unpublished works and statutory protection of published works received increasing criticism in the twentieth century, particularly as the notion of publication changed greatly with technological innovations in communication. Congress removed this distinction in the landmark Copyright Act of 1976 (17 U.S.C.A. § 102(a)). According to this statute, an author receives copyright protection as soon as a work is recorded in a concrete way—when, for example, it is written on a piece of paper, recorded on an audiotape, or stored on a computer disk. Any unauthorized copying of the work is subject to an infringement suit and criminal charges. The 1976 act also allows copyright protection of works that derive from the original, such as motion pictures, CD-ROM multimedia editions, and other adaptations. These subsequent creations are known as derivative works.""   Seeing as the gifs are derivative works, don't the movie studios own all rights to all products derived from them, aside from those that are comment, criticism, or parody?  Also, nowhere in the link was the phrase ""transformative work"" used.  Care to break it down for me?"
SplitDepthGIFS,2v6h4u,jesuriah,0,Sun Feb 8 21:04:56 2015 UTC,"Basic Books Vs. Kinkos    Dafuq does that have anything to do with the market price of freshly cut sloth toenails? Kinko's was flat-out copying entire chapters of published works and selling them. This is not a transformation nor does it fall under Fair Use for all sorts of reasons that your lawyer really ought to know about.  What's most troubling is that my initial assessment is correct: you have no understanding of what a ""transformative work"" is. Nor ""derivative"" in either the linguistic or the relevant legal sense. A transformation must necessarily be derived from something. The doctrine of Fair Use allows for all sorts of derivations based on the four tests codified in the 1976 law and further clarified in Campbell v. Acuff-Rose.  Fair Use is complex and touchy. If there was an admission fee {snip} that would be different. The snip is because I'm not going to write a long treatise on Copyright law here. The GIFs are short and all arguably fall under Fair Use provisions. The transformation itself is the copyrightable aspect: modifying the individual frames in such a way that viewing them as an animation now gives them a richer 3D appearance with no other technical means.  Note that this is dealing with Copyright; I'm not addressing anything involving Trademark law (and lawyers mix the two up all the time, sometimes intentionally). Ain't no Fair Use, ain't no transformations, ain't no four fried chickens or dry white toast. But trademark is also much narrower and requires believing that the potentially offending work could confuse a ""moron in a hurry"" such that he's likely to avoid the real item for the unofficial one.   I hope that answers your questions. If not, I may get back to you tonight, I may not, in which case I'll try tomorrow. But I gotta tell you, I'm trying to clear my shit out so that I can do a few of these myself. I can advise others but I just don't have the uninterrupted time that I need and I have some really good source material."

SplitDepthGIFS,2v6h4u,DIRTIEST_NIGGER,-5,Sun Feb 8 20:47:52 2015 UTC,"It's still good enough to submit a DMCA take down request.  edit:  To the people down voting, you do not have to be the original creator of whatever the item was that was turned into a gif in order to file a take down.  You need to show them that you were the creator of the copyright material that they stole and published as their own.  Just because a gif was created by something that is copyrighted does not automatically give the person who owns the copyright 100% rights to the created project.  Yes, they can tell you to take it down and stop using it but they cannot claim the object as their own."
SplitDepthGIFS,2v6h4u,Decyde,2,Sun Feb 8 16:08:29 2015 UTC,"No it's not. I handle DMCA requests as a part of my job; you have to be the copyright holder of the images in question to submit a DMCA takedown request, and the situation cannot be covered by ""fair use"" doctrine. IGN using it to drive traffic is likely not fair use, but you still need to be able to prove ownership of the materials"
SplitDepthGIFS,2v6h4u,masaoshigeta,5,Sun Feb 8 18:07:06 2015 UTC,It doesn't matter who owns the original copyright. These 3D gifs are a derivative work and as such the creator of the gif owns copyright to the gif as a new creative work based on the original image.  think of Andy Warhol and the Campbells soup paintings.
SplitDepthGIFS,2v6h4u,Alacritous,1 point,Sun Feb 8 19:20:39 2015 UTC,"As far as the submission of a DMCA request goes it does matter who the original copyright owner is. Either it's considered an original work, as you said, and DMCA isn't an option, or it's considered the same or derivative of the original work, and the copyright holder (or someone acting on their behalf) is the only one who can request a DMCA takedown"
SplitDepthGIFS,2v6h4u,masaoshigeta,3,Sun Feb 8 19:58:47 2015 UTC,With a derivative work both the original copyright owner AND the creator of the derivative work have the right to file a DMCA takedown request.
SplitDepthGIFS,2v6h4u,Alacritous,1 point,Sun Feb 8 20:02:58 2015 UTC,"I think all I have learned from this thread is that our legal system needs to be overhauled.  I've maintained for years that it has been written purposely abstruse, and I think this differing opinions over the same laws prove my point."
SplitDepthGIFS,2v6h4u,jesuriah,1 point,Sun Feb 8 21:10:29 2015 UTC,Thanks for the clarification
SplitDepthGIFS,2v6h4u,masaoshigeta,1 point,Mon Feb 9 02:05:28 2015 UTC,Technically they have to get permission of each original clip used!  I'm assuming ignore just does whatever the fuck they want to.
SplitDepthGIFS,2v6h4u,FarleyFinster,2,Sun Feb 8 16:27:39 2015 UTC,"They do not. Campbell v. Acuff-Rose Music, Inc., 510 U.S. 569 (1994)  Two Live Crew was explicitly denied permission to use the Pretty Woman lyrics. That they still ended up paying some money out has to do with other stupidities of the beast that is music licensing."

I would have never even heard about this if it wasn't posted on ign the first time along with the link to this subreddit.   just saying... It's not all bad
SplitDepthGIFS,2v6h4u,j5NR,9,Sun Feb 8 13:35:15 2015 UTC,"I agree, I said I'm my other comment that at least they mentioned the subreddit name and it will surely drive more traffic to the sub."

SplitDepthGIFS,2v6h4u,j5NR,3,Sun Feb 8 15:19:22 2015 UTC,There are a few options over on the right side bar.   Also someone just posted a way to make them using after effects which is what I'm doing today.   The first one I made I used photoshop

SplitDepthGIFS,2v2447,derpoglan,9,Sat Feb 7 07:07:30 2015 UTC,I'm curious how that works. I thought the white bars that matched the page background were necessary to create the illusion.

Thinking about space makes me a tad queezy and uncomfortable as well."
SplitDepthGIFS,2v16jw,Jarton,5,Sat Feb 7 05:34:20 2015 UTC,Very interesting. Would you say you feel fear in addition to queasiness? Can you induce the same feeling by imagining that you're floating out in space? Do you have trouble with terrestrial wide open spaces as well as celestial? Or is it the stars themselves that invoke the bad feels?
SplitDepthGIFS,2v16jw,TheCommissarGeneral,5,Sat Feb 7 06:43:13 2015 UTC,"Warning: boring astronomy lesson ahead, feel free to skip.   I think the nausea is stemmed from the fear and it's just the way I feel it. The idea of leaving good ol' Terra Firma is really suffocating and I've had nightmares of falling into the Sun that have kept me awake for two nights straight. I'll feel lightheaded staring at the sky for too long at night and just thinking about the vast expanse of the unknown I'm looking at. I am a horror junkie but space is one horror I will be happy to stay away from.   The floating in space is my absolute worst fear - the idea of it makes my chest tighten and my breathing difficult. You have absolutely nothing to push off of once you begin floating away except for solid bodies that will more than likely kill you before helping you, you'll be baked by solar winds if you're still in our solar system, and in the off chance your suit depressurises you'll enjoy the feeling of your body freezing solid while any liquid in your body boils and your body ballons to three times its original size for the last three seconds of your life.   You can kill me in any torturous way imaginable for however many years it would take and I will still die happier than if I was in space.   Terrestrial open spaces don't so much make me as scared as they make me paranoid. I feel more comfortable in a cramped elevator than I do in an open field. Flight is absolutely terrifying, but I have flown before and open water is nerve-racking but at least in the event of whatever I'm on sinking there are still ways to get to safety.   I think it all stems from the fact that the environment is so unusual and uncontrolled as well as insanely deadly. I have seen beautiful videos of deep space objects and photos that made all my problems feel insignificant. While I don't believe Martian colonization would be possible, the fact that we can explore beyond our planet is both amazing and horrifying, and I'm honestly looking forward to the data planned to come from the Pluto Express and the Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer (because while still terrifying, Europa has always been the most interesting interplanetary object).  But beyond all that there's still that fact that every 11 years our Sun will erupt in tonnes of solar prominences that fling balls of ionized helium bigger than itself off into space, it rains sulfuric acid on Venus, our own magnetic field which protects us from Solar radiation is slowly flipping its polarization and will become practically inert mid-flip, Jupiter is nearly large enough to become another star and its magnetic field extends beyond Saturn's orbit, it rains helium on Saturn, Europa is an ocean 10x deeper than our own with the highest potential for extraterrestrial life, and something hit Venus and Uranus hard enough during planetary formation to stop Venus' rotation and throw Uranus on its side. There's also that weird Black Knight Satellite that may or may not be real locked in polar orbit around Earth and the unsettling ""sounds"" of Jupiter and Saturn. Not to mention the horrors of hyper-velocity stars, pulsars, and the huge amount of exoplanets with unusual characteristics outside of our solar system. Did you know there is a planet made of burning ice? Ugh.   I've taken astronomy in high school to try and understand where the irrational fear comes from and plan on taking it again in college. After learning about what I did, I have gained more understanding and while I learned more personal nightmare fuel,  I also learned so many amazing things I otherwise would not have if I had just let my fear get the best of me."

SplitDepthGIFS,2uta0f,TerroristOgre,47,Wed Feb 4 23:53:41 2015 UTC,Just want to add that I think a lot of the effect is taken away when whatever is popping out goes out of frame of the gif.
SplitDepthGIFS,2uta0f,mrbudha1456,15,Thu Feb 5 02:49:14 2015 UTC,"Word up homie.  This sub reddit is fantastic, and soon as we get a few more contributors here I think the problem will go away itself. Right now people are still figuring out what works and what doesn't. Getting a feel for it so to speak."
SplitDepthGIFS,2uta0f,TimVicious,19,Thu Feb 5 03:59:41 2015 UTC,"Also, I've submitted nothing, but I also notice that a lot of the gifs end rather abruptly after breaking the white lines. They are really good but they end too soon"
SplitDepthGIFS,2uta0f,-Wrenegade-,8,Thu Feb 5 04:03:28 2015 UTC,"I too am a person contributing my two cents before contributing a gif! There are a few rules that will help immensely atop what OP brought up:  Don't break the frame with anything that is supposed to have depth unless it quickly leaves the frame entirely. Any portion of the frame covering something in the foreground loses the effect immediately. Using a ""false frame"" can actually enhance the effect of you have to break frame.   The white lines are for depth cues, treat them as if they move forward/towards the screen plane and the effect works it's own magic.   Lastly treat the screen plane as a window. Make everything feel like it's behind the screen as opposed to having the screen be the furthest potion in the scene and having the subject jump out too far. (EG: try for Pixar's Up, don't do Journey To the Center of the Earth 3D)  Please, this is just in the spirit of making better art, I do not mean to offend."

SplitDepthGIFS,2uta0f,Wrinklestiltskin,1 point,Thu Feb 5 04:56:52 2015 UTC,"The first one seemed to have the effect a bit, but there wasn't really any depth to the tongue. At least not that I perceived."

SplitDepthGIFS,2uta0f,daveodavey,3,Thu Feb 5 22:22:02 2015 UTC,Now we know how to do it right. So who's going to man up and just split depth the whole Avatar film?
SplitDepthGIFS,2uta0f,Bamres,3,Thu Feb 5 03:42:05 2015 UTC,"I agree, ive seen many submissions with good intentions that just don't do it for me"
SplitDepthGIFS,2uta0f,cinematek,3,Thu Feb 5 05:46:04 2015 UTC,"Adding to the trend of commenting-before-submitting. (Although I do have something special in the works.) That being said, I have also noticed that the ones that seem to work best are the ones where the white lines aren't broken, which can happen in two ways:  1) The main subject shouldn't ""break through"" the white lines, but should come around or between them and pass in front. (I think there was a Cheshire Cat one where the effect worked really well once his head was out front, but wasn't so good for the transition from the background due to his face passing through the white lines. In that case, animating the white bars in from the sides during the transition phase may have helped to preserve the illusion.)  2) Once in front, the main subject shouldn't unnaturally cut into the white bars. This happens, for instance, when someone sticks their head in front of the white lines, but then moves over far enough that it feels like the white line has passed through their neck.   In general, the depth bars should be treated like real-world objects that happen to be in front of the screen. You can go around or between, but not through.  I'm planning to experiment with a few new techniques including varying the width and color of the lines, moving the lines during the GIF and playing with additional frame breaks, such as false hard-matte letterboxing, which might let the subject ""come out of the box"". We will see. This is going to be my next project.  EDIT: I just saw the Jurassic World GIF by /u/ArkadySvidrigailov which breaks the white line rule, but plays nicely with false added matting at the top and bottom. The black bars add a second 3D reveal to that GIF that works really nicely."
SplitDepthGIFS,2uta0f,PM_ME_DOGECOINS,3,Thu Feb 5 08:57:04 2015 UTC,The most important part is that your source video should not look like shit. Sometimes a lot of work ends up being for naught simply because the source material is in bad quality or has low resolution.
SplitDepthGIFS,2uta0f,MagmaBiscuit,2,Thu Feb 5 17:12:11 2015 UTC,"One problem with slow-motion shots is the constant adjusting you have to do with objects.  As an example, here's my own one, which I fucked up at the corner. If you look at the ""O"" key, the constant adjusting was much more difficult in slow motion, so I kind of cheated by blurring the edges of the bar. Slow moving objects are difficult to use, but the effect will be really good when done right."
SplitDepthGIFS,2uta0f,MagmaBiscuit,1 point,Thu Feb 5 18:38:34 2015 UTC,That's a fantastic example of one that works bro. Good job

SplitDepthGIFS,2uta0f,shijinn,5,Thu Feb 5 09:56:28 2015 UTC,the original is already 3D    I came to this sub because I can't see 3D well (one eye did not develop properly) and split depth helps me actually see more depth on a gif than I do IRL.  So no. The original is not already 3D. The lines do add the illusion of depth.
SplitDepthGIFS,2uta0f,AyaJulia,2,Thu Feb 5 09:39:03 2015 UTC,"oh, the two vertical trees aren't equivalent to the two white lines?"
SplitDepthGIFS,2uta0f,shijinn,3,Thu Feb 5 15:41:11 2015 UTC,"Look, I know when I'm getting a sense of depth. Combatively trying to convince me that the trees suffice in place of the lines isn't going to suddenly change my perception of depth. I see trees all the time, and I see stuff moving in front of trees, and the only reason I know the thing in front of the tree is closer to me than the tree is if it wasn't, they'd briefly be hidden behind the tree. But it's still a flat 2D picture. Even IRL when it's not. I also suck at sports because I have absolutely no sense of how close the ball is to my face.  Maybe it has something to do with the white lines blending into the background of reddit that gives objects the illusion of popping out of the screen. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯"
SplitDepthGIFS,2uta0f,AyaJulia,1 point,Thu Feb 5 15:47:59 2015 UTC,"not trying to be contrary, just curious. is it something i can replicate by covering one eye? i can't find a good video of the original but it appears to make little difference.   edit: ok, choosing not to go full screen so that the white lines blend with the background seem to make it better, but at this point i've rewatched it so many times i'm no longer partial. will check again later if i find a better video of the original."
SplitDepthGIFS,2uta0f,shijinn,2,Thu Feb 5 16:11:51 2015 UTC,"Pardon my snark in response to your imagined combativeness then. So used to having to defend myself everywhere.  Yes, you might be able to replicate it by covering one eye.  Here are some of the ones that have had a really profound illusion of depth for me.  Example 1 I think the big thing with this one is focal length. The head doesn't go out of frame like the eagle's wings do, and the camera's focal length causes the seal's head to look slimmer as it approaches the lens.  Example 2 this one is a REALLY strong illusion of depth for me, and I can't quite pinpoint why. I thought it had a much stronger depth of field effect (blurred background) that really forced you to focus on the guns, but now it doesn't seem that way. Regardless, still super strong.  Example 2a Another example of depth of field helping the illusion.  Example 3 this creepy fucker shows how crazy effective a false frame the same color as reddit's background can be."

Or in other words, when the wings cross over the lines.  The lines are positioned to be in front of everything else in the picture.  Which is noticeable by the bushes.  Yet the wings cross the lines just after the trees.  So basically our brain doesn't get tricked because we visually see the depth isn't right."

They are inefficient as a result, compared to a helicopter that has more mechanical articulation points. For a larger machine, currently, a helicopter makes more sense."

So it's like we're looking through a window at something deeper than the screen. But then the object appears to cover the white lines, so our brains quickly decide that the object is in front of the lines, and therefore closer than the screen! It's tough to get it just right, and few of these GIFs have the right combo of source material and technique (almost all of mine don't!)."

When we first see the white lines, our brain connects them to being part of the foreground of the screen. We expect the wings to go in front of the trees, how could they not? But we don't expect the wings to go in front of the lines. I guess we do now because we've seen many of these and we're jaded.

SplitDepthGIFS,2unh9s,tburn1,1 point,Tue Feb 3 16:56:20 2015 UTC,Nice tutorial! I notice you didn't go i to blurring out objects to give a depth of field as they move towards the camera. Can this be done in AE as well?
SplitDepthGIFS,2unh9s,36DD,1 point,Sat Feb 7 08:19:04 2015 UTC,"You could, yeah, though I haven't done it. That hawk GIF that I did had the blur in the source material due to the shooting!  You'd duplicate the footage layer, mask the main thing, then apply a blur effect from the default list."
SplitDepthGIFS,2unh9s,TheNumerOne,2,Sat Feb 7 16:38:52 2015 UTC,"Great job on this.  You mentioned the PNG sequence, that's the best way to preserve the colour of the gif, it saves more of the colours than normal Photoshop will allow, so the best quality way of doing it.  Also, if you have the option (which I think you do), if you do the PNG sequence, use File--->Open, instead of the Import Video Frames to Layers, it allows you to set the specific frame rate, instead of the frame delay on the import frame timeline.    Also, since you are learning AE (which I am as well), and love gifs, you should come over and hang out and post some gifs on /r/highqualitygifs.  There are some good resources on the sidebar there for making gifs in AE, and some good content."

SplitDepthGIFS,2uizxq,Slappamedoo,29,Mon Feb 2 19:32:43 2015 UTC,Gotta give some credit to the camera man. I've always wondered how can they possibly know where and when an animal is gonna do some awesome shit.
SplitDepthGIFS,2uizxq,MelAlvarado,35,Mon Feb 2 20:25:15 2015 UTC,"It's not luck really, you position yourself and up to dozens of camera's in a location that you know is an active lifestyle spot. And you sit there for days, to weeks, to months, to maybe even years waiting for something to happen. Then after that long as hell time you browse through your collection and get the 10seconds of footage out of days worth and present it. It's amazing how dedicated the nature documentors are and far they are willing to go to get the most interesting shots."
SplitDepthGIFS,2uizxq,TheBananaPuncher,7,Mon Feb 2 20:39:24 2015 UTC,So... luck?
SplitDepthGIFS,2uizxq,naukofox,8,Tue Feb 3 13:30:45 2015 UTC,"If you throw 100 darts at a target and hit at least 1, I wouldn't call it luck."
SplitDepthGIFS,2uizxq,ReiBob,3,Tue Feb 3 14:25:28 2015 UTC,"I'd say waiting for years for an animal to make just the right shot is the very definition of luck. I'm not trying to belittle the work that goes into it, but at the end its still a chaotic, infinite amount of possibilities that lead to an epic nature shot"
SplitDepthGIFS,2uizxq,naukofox,3,Tue Feb 3 14:32:49 2015 UTC,"But they don't just sit in any random rock and wait for something, that's my point.  Sure, there's always luck in the line too. But they know the spots where they are, the animals they're trying to shoot. But yeah, I think in the end they do feel lucky :)"
SplitDepthGIFS,2uizxq,ReiBob,2,Tue Feb 3 14:44:32 2015 UTC,"It's a mix of both. I can throw 100 darts at a dartboard and hit it every throw, but I may never hit the bullseye even though I know where to throw it. I'll still make a lot of decent/good throws, but might not get the perfect throw. Same thing - they know where to take the shots and might get 100 decent/good shots that people will think are impressive, but that doesn't mean they'll get that perfect shot."
SplitDepthGIFS,2uizxq,dvaunr,1 point,Tue Feb 3 15:43:24 2015 UTC,True
SplitDepthGIFS,2uizxq,ReiBob,2,Wed Feb 4 16:14:17 2015 UTC,"It's luck in the same way that winning in poker is luck. You can do all you want to maximize your odds, but it still comes down to animals happening to do something in front of your cameras.  Like poker, you can manage the odds to make a profit in the long run, but you still have good and bad breaks in the short term."

Badass gif by the way, thanks for posting it.   Have you tried that tool someone made? I think they have a link in the sidebar. Edit: just double checked and they do."

SplitDepthGIFS,2uizxq,Mercinary909,6,Mon Feb 2 23:01:00 2015 UTC,"They add depth to the image, but not a ""coming out of the screen"" kind of effect. That could only happen if you believed the trees to be part of your screen rather than in the image itself, which the white bars would accomplish.

SplitDepthGIFS,2u7gzu,thebbman,2,Fri Jan 30 18:16:03 2015 UTC,I'm a little confused. So you mean there should be a thin line on the right that he's already in front of in the beginning? Or have him pass over the left one and under the right one?
SplitDepthGIFS,2u7gzu,peteyboy100,5,Fri Jan 30 19:01:55 2015 UTC,"I think it would work better if you change the left one instead.

SplitDepthGIFS,2u7gzu,plasmav2,3,Fri Jan 30 20:59:42 2015 UTC,I honestly don't know how to describe it. Basically you need some kind of overlapping with the two lines to create the depth.

SplitDepthGIFS,2tbbxa,bcn_dbl_chz_brgr,9,Fri Jan 23 02:48:07 2015 UTC,Is the right bar needed in this particular gif? Seems like it would still work with just one since all the action is on the left side. For the record I know nothing about this subject.
SplitDepthGIFS,2tbbxa,CookieFish,4,Thu Jan 22 19:05:02 2015 UTC,I think it helps because your brain assumes the bars are the same distance away so it makes her head look like it's behind her hand.
SplitDepthGIFS,2tbbxa,IamGrimReefer,6,Fri Jan 23 04:24:09 2015 UTC,but the bars are different widths which ruins the illusion.

SplitDepthGIFS,2tafsi,SPNR128,6,Thu Jan 22 14:21:13 2015 UTC,"Here is my overly critical reply. Simply put between the death star and the explosion itself, no white line is needed. It's a neat effect to be sure but the Falcon is already jumping off the screen at you and that's the point of the vfx in this scene.   I'd have to see a version without the white line to be certain but I'll bet it doesn't add much with the shortwave and everything being there to sort of backdrop it already."

SplitDepthGIFS,2tafsi,the_enginerd,3,Thu Jan 22 17:53:57 2015 UTC,I think you could Do this horizontal at a deeper depth but then the shock wave would need to cross it too.  Maybe add white border where the explosion and the Falcon pop out?

I would suggest lower that one, shrink it and have it interact with the vehicle close to the rear of it. Go so far as to fill in the inside of the truck since it is open.  Add two more lines that are thicker (not so thick as this one I think) which cut it in thirds and use that for the cop car.  I might even crop out some of the sides a bit. Horizontal bars are a touch awkward in really wide gifs in my opinion.  Oh, almost forgot to say; You did do an excellent job of cutting it together, it was just placement that I disagreed with was all."

SplitDepthGIFS,2t6a8a,Chieron,116,Wed Jan 21 17:32:52 2015 UTC,Here's a quick job.
SplitDepthGIFS,2t6a8a,FarleyFinster,56,Wed Jan 21 15:56:05 2015 UTC,The blurry fence needs to break through the bars. What do you use for general editing/masking each frame?  Edit: and why would someone downvote this? The fence is foreground. The camera is right at it; the imaginary plane is around halfway between it and the thrower. Therefore needs to be visible over the white bars for the illusion to be consistent and work.

SplitDepthGIFS,2t8ozo,FarleyFinster,1 point,Thu Jan 22 03:08:11 2015 UTC,"The real problem is that the bars are moving too much to allow for the effect to work well. What this needs first is a really good fix from r/ImageStabilization/, one which makes the static bits persistent when they're out of view on any particular frame. Then you can put in the bars and lack of motion in the background will work.   For extra goodness, when she's in the left or right third, make any text you can see in the middle slightly blurred. You can also blur edges of the middle column for the few frames when she's completely forward to increase the effect."

Like right near the end, when the button goes from being perpendicular to the viewing plane to being parallel to it, have the left edge cross the left line and then the right side break through the right line.  Rewatched it a couple times, looks like you could leave the interaction with the left line as it is, and just let it start behind the right line, breaking through it as the button straightens out."
SplitDepthGIFS,2t6b55,knwr,1 point,Wed Jan 21 18:43:08 2015 UTC,"It would be best if you move the lines to the right a bit, so the face moves onto the line after moving upwards a bit. Instead of starting on the line. When it just flashes onto the line in v2 it doesn't work as well. I think it's best if it doesn't start behind the line, but out of field with the line. Or if you were really crazy you could have it in field and behind the line at the beginning, and then peel the line away with one of the flips that the coin does. Just my two cents"

SplitDepthGIFS,2t9g0f,zorga,2,Fri Jan 23 14:42:02 2015 UTC,Its called a dolly zoom. You start the shot zoomed in and far back and zoom out while you move forwards at the same rate. Or vice-versa. Was famously used in Jaws  Heres the wiki
SplitDepthGIFS,2t9g0f,Kolione,1 point,Fri Jan 23 23:11:21 2015 UTC,"Dolly zoom:       The dolly zoom is an unsettling in-camera effect that appears to undermine normal visual perception. It is part of many cinematic techniques used in filmmaking and television production.  The effect is achieved by zooming a zoom lens to adjust the angle of view (often referred to as field of view or FOV) while the camera dollies (or moves) towards or away from the subject in such a way as to keep the subject the same size in the frame throughout. In its classic form, the camera angle is pulled away from a subject while the lens zooms in, or vice-versa. Thus, during the zoom, there is a continuous perspective distortion, the most directly noticeable feature being that the background appears to change size relative to the subject.  The visual appearance for the viewer is that either the background suddenly grows in size and detail and overwhelms the foreground, or the foreground becomes immense and dominates its previous setting, depending on which way the dolly zoom is executed. As the human visual system uses both size and perspective cues to judge the relative sizes of objects, seeing a perspective change without a size change is a highly unsettling effect, often with strong emotional impact.

SplitDepthGIFS,2t6li7,AndaleTheGreat,2,Wed Jan 21 21:59:39 2015 UTC,"I think the original was better. In the original you presume the distance to the lines is set from the camera, which moves away from the character rather than the character moving back.  I think the second version is making the assumption of the rockets reaching a distance close to the camera's end destination, but the lines are still attached to the camera. I think that to make this look right you would have to move the lines into position as the camera backs up. Bring them in from the sides might be difficult as the harsh white lines might just create a weird looking wipe effect. I would think that having them fade in and shrink in width over a couple frames then after a few frames after full opacity have them fire thru. I would suggest to keep shrinking the lines and having them close in to add to the effect as well."

I don't think that your 'fading' method is working too well. Maybe if it were black lines instead.  The ground should be overlapping as well. You cannot just use the subject, you also need to see the background has depth. This might benefit from horizontal lines rather than vertical ones that disappear into the ground.

Also, in my opinion most people are basing these on the lines being a set distance from camera but often forget that they should be equidistant if there is no distinguishing feature to the lines (like one being thinner to be farther).  I'd really have to stare at it more but I feel like she comes to much thru the left and not enough thru the right.  Make sure you go thru your frames carefully to check for clean edges as well.

I really wish I could easily frame by frame these things or that people would post gifv or html5 versions. Its just I swear there is something off with the right side. Maybe it is the frame rate that is making me think that. It feels like there is no in between state on right side. Like it completely drops thru the line between two frame with no overlapping moment. Which could easily be true.  I wonder if it would add to the effect if a third, thinner line were placed to the left. Pass the object thru it a few frames before it would be level with the pole. Maybe halfway up the full arc.  Just a thought I had."

SplitDepthGIFS,2szu1t,BookwormSkates,4,Tue Jan 20 03:29:26 2015 UTC,"Despite knowing this, my brain will always be surprised. I'm not convinced our brains are all that smart..."
SplitDepthGIFS,2szu1t,SonicFrost,6,Tue Jan 20 06:57:03 2015 UTC,"First of all, you need to understand the concept that everything we perceive is first processed by our brain, which then constructs our view of the world based from the 'raw' signals that come in. This happens without us being aware of it (thankfully), but it can lead to 'weird' or interesting perceptive errors.  The most prominent examples of those perceptive errors are optical illusions. In those, an image is set up in a way that specifically causes the brain to make false assumptions, which results in an incorrect perception of what's on the image. That's why straight lines may appear jagged, or two exact same shades of grey may appear to be of different brightness. Your brain picks up all of that information, then interprets it, and gives you a view of reality based on that interpretation - and that interpretation may (and does) not always match up with what's actually there.  The same principle applies to these types of gif. Normally, our brain creates our perception of depth by processing the visual data coming from both our eyes, comparing them and constructing an 'inner three-dimensional view' of the scene; you can try it by pulling out a sheet of paper, drawing a dot onto it, placing it a bit away from you, covering up one of your eyes and attempting to place your finger exactly on that dot from a short distance. You'll struggle with it! However, your finger will generally be pretty close to that dot, and when you close one of your eyes, the whole world does not suddenly appear two-dimensional, so there's obviously more to depth perception than just having two eyes.  Imagine being a prison guard. An inmate is sitting behind iron bars in a nearby confinement cell. The inmate is clearly behind the bars, as you can see the bars in front of him; they cover up your view of him. Now, the inmate puts his hands through the gaps between the iron bars. Suddenly, his hand blocks your view of the iron bars, so your brain interprets that the bars are now behind the hands instead of the other way around. And that's how the gifs work - even though you don't have the necessary information to construct an 'inner view' of the scene in the gif (since you only have one 'eye', or perspective, of it), you do have other information that can be used to infer depth. In this case, it's the white bars that cover up the view of what's behind them. When, later in the gif, something suddenly covers up the bars, your brain interprets that it has moved closer to you, since now, your view of the white bars is covered up. And that interpretation becomes your perception, which is why it looks like something's coming out of the gifs!"

SplitDepthGIFS,2t3wft,jerkstoresup,4,Tue Jan 20 23:29:59 2015 UTC,Might do more if anyone has requests for a good scene. Here's my process if anyone is interested:   Open video scene in Virtualdub Export frames to still images Open still image sequence in Photoshop CC Create video group layer with the two white lines Split that layer for each frame Erase each frame's white line where needed Save   Took me less than 20 minutes for each one. Photoshop work looks like this.
SplitDepthGIFS,2t3wft,_Cid,-3,Tue Jan 20 23:37:05 2015 UTC,http://np.reddit.com/r/SplitDepthGIFS/comments/2t3h5j/mark_it_zero/ Better than both of your attempts.
SplitDepthGIFS,2t3wft,Pseudoboss11,0,Wed Jan 21 00:31:16 2015 UTC,"Not at all. The color is blocky and downright awful, the animation has been slowed and the framerate lowered to the point where it's painful to watch.   If you're going to pass judgment over gifs, at least make sure that the gif you're claiming is better is, in fact, better."
SplitDepthGIFS,2t3wft,redgarrett,3,Wed Jan 21 16:41:51 2015 UTC,"It's better because Walter's hand breaks the split depth line at the end. Without that, the gif just looks weird. Especially when his forearm breaks it earlier in the gif, like in OP's attempt. The animation quality in this one isn't as great, but the split-depth effect is a hundred times better."
SplitDepthGIFS,2t4r19,SpareLiver,2,Wed Jan 21 03:33:37 2015 UTC,"Ball should come outside the bottom white edge. The two white lines appear to be at the same level as the white outside. So essentially it looks like it goes past the white edge, then, without moving, appears flat.   new to the sub, but I understand the concept. Sadly I can't fix it just yet."
SplitDepthGIFS,2t4r19,Trail_of_Jeers,2,Wed Jan 21 04:55:43 2015 UTC,"Add more lines for the small ones on the side, I don't see what the obsession is for just two vertical lines...  Sometimes you need horizontal ones, or just to move the lines  Here's the best example of what to do: http://oyster.ignimgs.com/wordpress/stg.ign.com/2015/01/NAr5qeJ.gif  You want to make it look like the orbs are going through a plane, window, etc, and because they are so small you need to make the white lines bigger to contrast that effect.  Hope this helps."
SplitDepthGIFS,2t4r19,Shayz_,2,Wed Jan 21 07:41:57 2015 UTC,"I'd say a part of the problem is a gif.  These work well with a static background, making the lines appear as physically there, rather than a part of the frame.  When the only things moving are the things changing depth, it works perfectly.    Still, quite well done."

My right eye is almost the same as the left one. But if I close my right eye nothing happens and if I close the left eye everything slightly moves to the left and further away ( I feel like I'm looking further away than with my left eye and I start to feel that I'm constantly concentrating). As well as if I start paying attention to the differences I can sometimes see that one eye is seeing things kinda brighter but I don't think that matters.  So yeah, isn't this what a lazy eye is? :("

I used to think ""what hoax is this...? I'm not seeing anything different than a normal movie"". I seriously used to think that 3D movies are placebo effect and people claim they are seeing 3D because studios are telling them they are seeing 3D. Then I started having more trouble focusing IRL and got diagnosed by a ophthalmologist. Yep, busted 3D vision. :( Already had a surgery to correct it but the surgeon further fucked it up.  I see real world in 3D just fine though. No problem with depth perception there."

SplitDepthGIFS,2sz6g0,AffectedRyan,33,Mon Jan 19 21:16:24 2015 UTC,"This would work better if he didn't move over the line on the right. Part of the illusion is that the lines are the same distance from the viewer, to your brain. Since the camera pans but doesn't appreciably move forward or back it is strange that the guy goes from being behind the lines to being in front of them. It appears that the right line is farther away in 3D space, yet it is the same size as the other line and just as in focus.  edit: Here is an image version of what I mean. The illusion arises because the white bars are like ""jail cell bars"" on the fourth wall that is your computer screen. But when the boy in the gif moves over the right bar, your brain repositions it behind him instead of in the same plane as the screen and the left bar, where it should be (the red line in my image).  In fact, this isn't really an optimal scene to use for this effect at all because neither of the characters move forward or back relative to the camera, they only move to the side. To do this effect right, you really need an object that moves ""diagonally"" through space—both forward so it comes out of the bars, and to the side so it moves over the bars."

SplitDepthGIFS,2sz4zt,bluetaffy,1 point,Tue Jan 20 07:00:35 2015 UTC,"They're probably brown because that was what your background colour was set to when you saved the file.  GIFs have one bit of transparency, but it also saves background colour information for programs that can't do transparency. Typically this background colour is determined by the background colour set for use with your tools in whatever program you use to save it, if I remember correctly."
SplitDepthGIFS,2sz4zt,Sophira,3,Tue Jan 20 03:17:57 2015 UTC,"I didn't save it though. It's just that in RES it showed up brown for me for some reason (using subreddit style) and when click the link to open the imgur direct page, it was white, just like the default background of webpages in my Chrome"

SplitDepthGIFS,2sz4zt,gnarvin,11,Tue Jan 20 03:40:40 2015 UTC,Whatever is going around the lines would prolly also need to be blurry.  The effect is created by the fact that the bars are clearly inbetween you and the object and then the object extends past that boundary.  If you blur the lines but not the object your mind will probably accept the bars as the background behind the clearly focused object as opposed to the foreground which i think is necessary for this effect.

SplitDepthGIFS,2t0mpc,CandyJar,2,Wed Jan 21 00:27:06 2015 UTC,Also helps if the focus changes. It's what your eyes would do if it were coming out of the screen.  Like this one http://38.media.tumblr.com/26a6341b3d3b102477e27acef2fe69ea/tumblr_n3z9r68f001siwk80o1_500.gif

SplitDepthGIFS,2sze2p,MrClimatize,30,Mon Jan 19 22:11:26 2015 UTC,"My hypothesis is that the best 3D effect is felt best when the object doesn't intersect the lines. It should rather move between them. So basically - the scene in GIF is what should affect placement of the lines. The thickness doesn't play any role, I think of them more as an UI element which defines your screen boundaries (those get ""broken"" when object passes them, thus making the 3D effect). Keep in mind that this is nonscientific guess.  Edit: To clarify - the object doesn't intersect the lines:  http://i.imgur.com/Afkkhrx.gif - the guns move almost perfectly inbetween lines  http://i.imgur.com/ZaskDW7.gif - the same here  http://i.imgur.com/oWQxngO.gif - here the some parts of object intersect the lines, but it is a thing you most likely can't avoid completely. However the effect still works brilliantly!   The object intersects the lines : http://i.imgur.com/3BnqfnH.gif"
SplitDepthGIFS,2sze2p,L77,6,Mon Jan 19 22:42:49 2015 UTC,"This was the conclusion I had come to as well, having seen all the gifs on this subreddit. I think the best way to do it is to position the lines specifically to avoid intersection.  So essentially, this effect is a type of breaking the fourth wall. Having done a considerable amount of research into comics, I've seen that this effect can be very powerful, if done correctly. /u/L77 seems to have the right of it, in explaining that the lines are a UI element, not a part of the scene. It's the actual act of actually breaking what has been established as ""the boundary"" that causes an interesting effect. Intersecting them makes them feel less real, and more like a guideline than a boundary."

Because this is ultimately an illusion where the lines trick your brain into thinking that the ""screen"" is where those lines are, anything that is perceived to be ""in front"" of the lines gives the effect.   This makes me think that both the background and the proximity of the subject to the camera have a significant impact on the apparent depth."

SplitDepthGIFS,2szgbg,Dreadp1r4te,9,Wed Jan 21 14:56:14 2015 UTC,"It's actually a combination of depth of field and the white bars as a static reference plane. While the effect will work with just the white bars and the focal object moving behind/in front of them, the effect is even more magnified by the object being out of focus and moving into it, or back ground objects drifting out of focus. We see in binocular vision, and as a result can only focus on a certain distance away at a time, so our brains are used to things being out of focus when farther/closer than what we're looking at. By making part of the image out of focus, it tricks our mind into assuming it is in fact farther/closer than the object we're looking at."
SplitDepthGIFS,2szgbg,fookee,9,Tue Jan 20 17:10:26 2015 UTC,"It's not the splitting of the GIFs, but the fact that sometimes, the subject of focus is behind the white bars, and sometimes in front of them.
