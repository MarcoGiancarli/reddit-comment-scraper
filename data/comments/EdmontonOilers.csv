Here's the description:  Sept. 28, 1997   ""The Oilers have started their first preseason game a while ago. They played against the Anaheim Mighty Ducks. The Oilers of course beat Anahiem (sp) 4-1. Their regular season start on October 1st. Before summer started the Oilers beat Dallas Stars. But they got beat by Colarado (sp) Avalanche. Detroit won the Stanley Cup. But this year the Oilers are going to win the Stanley Cup. Some local owners have offered to keep the Oilers in Edmonton. They are still working on what they are going to do. Some people in other places don't believe in the Oilers. But they don't know them. We fought Dallas when the score was 2-0. We won 4-2 when their (sp) was only 4 minutes in the game.

EdmontonOilers,3e08u8,Tylemaker,3,Tue Jul 21 04:00:31 2015 UTC,"IIRC,   McDavid's father basically told him ""Don't be a Lindros."" (in regards to how Lindros didn't report to Quebec and forced them to trade him.)"
EdmontonOilers,3e08u8,Oilfan94,3,Tue Jul 21 15:21:21 2015 UTC,"I think it was more of a statement that McDavid is nothing like Lindros, I don't think Connor had to be told that."
EdmontonOilers,3e08u8,McEirhead,2,Tue Jul 21 15:48:24 2015 UTC,"I remember that it was in an interview, Connor was speaking about how his parents raised him.  The topic was something along the lines of how he could basically choose where he wants to play by refusing to show up, in Junior (which is fairly common) and in the NHL, like Lindros did.  When the Erie Otters drafted him, they were a bad team, and some people suggested that he could choose not to show up and force them to trade his rights to another team...maybe even a team of his choosing.    Connor said that his father told him that he didn't want to be 'that guy'.  So to him, it was never an option not to go to Erie, and it was never an option not to come to [Edmonton]. (the interview was after the lottery, but before the draft).    So they never used the line 'Don't be a Lindros'....but that is basically what was implied."
EdmontonOilers,3dzx36,rundatlife,9,Mon Jul 20 21:55:02 2015 UTC,Are we going by players on ELC are automatically protected?
EdmontonOilers,3dzx36,areyouhappynowethan,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:27:28 2015 UTC,"According to what I can find; not protected unless you decide they are; but each team only lost two players, with two new teams coming in simultaneously."
EdmontonOilers,3dzx36,A5hcrack,9,Mon Jul 20 22:39:58 2015 UTC,"Nope, in 2000 all players under ELCs were protected. At least as far as I remember."
EdmontonOilers,3dzx36,shweet44722,2,Mon Jul 20 22:43:11 2015 UTC,I don't think elcs as they are now existed then. Weren't they part of the nuclear lockout where they torched the season or were they in the one where they only torched half the season?
EdmontonOilers,3dzx36,haterbehatin,3,Tue Jul 21 00:26:42 2015 UTC,"I just checked wiki but honestly couldn't find it. I'm on mobile, so that may be part of it, but used certainly possible that ELCs were implemented during one of the two (the full season lockout being more likely I think. Certainly wouldn't be the first time I'm horribly mistaken."
EdmontonOilers,3dzx36,shweet44722,2,Tue Jul 21 00:57:42 2015 UTC,I can't remember the specifics and I'm frankly too lazy to search but I think it was the ones with the massive overhaul that saw the age of free agency lowered and ELCs became standardized and capped.   It'll be interesting to see what rules they put into place for the next round of expansion because it's basically a whole new league with the cap and various rule changes around contracts.   Even things like NMC's I can't really remember during the last round of expansion.
EdmontonOilers,3dzx36,haterbehatin,2,Tue Jul 21 01:08:34 2015 UTC,Actually that would be my question... what about any players with NMCs?
EdmontonOilers,3dzx36,arcticcatherder,2,Tue Jul 21 19:07:27 2015 UTC,I'm not sure. There seems to be speculation by people but nothing concrete. Here's an /r/hockey thread on this topic with some info but none of it seems conclusive.   Hopefully this expansion draft is like past expansion drafts and teams lose nothing of value now that the Oilers finally have some valuable pieces.
EdmontonOilers,3dzx36,haterbehatin,2,Tue Jul 21 19:31:21 2015 UTC,"I can't find anything documented to support that, but Tom Poti was in the second year of his ELC equivalent, was coming off his second full season in the league, had 35 pts, was +8, and wasn't on the oilers protected list. That seems like the kind of player you would lose, certainly over Jim Dowd (9 years older, journeyman, had never played over 60 games in an NHL season before 99-00, and Bert Robertsson (had never played a full NHL season despite being 3 years older than Poti, 50+ GP, 4 pts in 99-00) which were the two players that the Oilers lost in that Draft. There must have been something protecting players on their first contract."
EdmontonOilers,3dzx36,A5hcrack,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:40:31 2015 UTC,"Hmmm, certainly seems that way. I find it odd that it's incredibly difficult to find concrete rules and background for all this."

EdmontonOilers,3dzx36,A5hcrack,2,Tue Jul 21 04:59:21 2015 UTC,"First off, that was a damn good find, thanks.  And yeah, that would make sense. Any unsigned RFA or ELC player would likely be off limits."

EdmontonOilers,3dzx36,A5hcrack,9,Mon Jul 20 22:21:48 2015 UTC,"Using the 2000 parameters: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2000_NHL_Expansion_Draft  Goalies: Cam Talbot  Defensemen: Sekera, Klefbom, Fayne, Nurse, Reinhart.  Forwards: Eberle, Hall, Nugent-Hopkins, McDavid, Pouliot, Yakupov, Lander, Letestu, Draisaitl.  I think the only Argument you can have is do you give them Fayne or Schultz? Whichever you leave unprotected is almost a lock to be selected. If Ference's NMC would mean that you had to keep him, he would be a buyout prior to the expansion draft, since the earliest this will happen is next year, he's probably gone anyway. Maybe a prospect jumps out to supplant Letestu on the list."
EdmontonOilers,3dzx36,Tylemaker,7,Mon Jul 20 22:26:38 2015 UTC,Would definitely protect Schultz over Ference. Especially with the age gap
EdmontonOilers,3dzx36,A5hcrack,6,Mon Jul 20 23:28:33 2015 UTC,Absolutely. That's not even a question. It's just a matter of his No Move Clause possibly forcing the team to protect him. I'm not sure how that would work. He would have to be bought out if that were the case.
EdmontonOilers,3dzx36,learn2die101,2,Tue Jul 21 02:11:24 2015 UTC,I imagine we would buy him out in order to protect assets if we had to. That our her could waive his nmc for the event of an expansion draft.
EdmontonOilers,3dzx36,A5hcrack,0,Tue Jul 21 20:51:17 2015 UTC,"unless there is a drastic change in his life off the ice I don't think he's going to waive that NMC. He came to be a part of this community and be close to his family. The massive pay raise helped I'm sure, but he is unlikely to voluntarily move.  With the wrinkle of ELC's being exempt from the draft that opens up five of the slots. With Klefbom (depending on how they rule on players that have not yet become restricted free agents), Reinhart, Nurse, McDavid and Draisaitl all being ELC players. So you fill those slots with Schultz, Davidson, Pitlick, Hunt, and Miller? I don't think it's particularly likely that the last two would be going anywhere if left unprotected and if they were it's not a particularly heavy loss. I would think that barring a massive resurgence in a real professional level defensive system, Ference is likely to be bought out next year anyway. If that resurgence were to happen, and by that I mean that if Ference were to rebound and play like a legitimate third pair guy under McLellan, the organization is so young that it doesn't really hurt anything to use a spot on him. Brad Hunt is never going to play another game for the Oilers anyway barring four injuries to the D-core"
EdmontonOilers,3dzx36,trippymane9,4,Tue Jul 21 21:27:21 2015 UTC,"You don't need to protect Drai, McDavid, Nurse because they are still on ELC's then."

Nurse and Reinhart will spend less than half the season in the nhl in an attempt to hamper their earnings as they are both heavy on the bonuses.

EdmontonOilers,3dv0dp,SNPmarty009,17,Sun Jul 19 19:09:59 2015 UTC,I honestly think Jultz will have a very good season that shuts up a lot of the haters. Talbot will play well but nothing too insane and we'll end up 10th in the west. I think the safest bet is that Hall will miss about 20 games and Nurse and Reinhart will spend the majority of the season in the NHL due to injuries and solid play.
EdmontonOilers,3dv0dp,eatingasspatties,3,Sun Jul 19 20:07:14 2015 UTC,"My guess would be about 10th place, as well, with the current roster.  If we can get another top 4 d-man and a bigger power forward, I think we'll have a chance at the playoffs."
EdmontonOilers,3dv0dp,darkstar107,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:17:12 2015 UTC,"10th is exactly where I would peg them as well.  The goalies should push each other as Talbot is a UFA in the summer and Scrivens wants that number 1 spot.  If we are close to a playoff push maybe the Oil make some moves at the trade deadline, otherwise 10th this year and playoffs next year in the new building."

EdmontonOilers,3dv0dp,WarmBagOfLotion,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:33:35 2015 UTC,In case you're interested here is a projection by Sportsnet on how well he might do in terms of points. Its based on stats and not some frivolous sense of attachment to him as I've seen done on a few other articles.
EdmontonOilers,3dv0dp,RedOilSaints,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:08:44 2015 UTC,77 points seems pretty reasonable. I'd assume that'd be around 28 G - 49 A - 77P
EdmontonOilers,3dv0dp,IGOR_ULANOV_55_BEST,4,Mon Jul 20 16:17:50 2015 UTC,"I swear to god i am a very realistic person, and i havent thought we would make playoffs for maybe 6 years.  Having said that, i think McDavid gets 80 points, Hall around the same. Yakupov has a breakout season. Not sure about Talbot.  Mclellan is a breath of fresh air for the entire club, and the Oilers end up in the playoffs.  BUT even if i am wrong. There is no way it can be worse then last few seasons so i am happy regardless."
EdmontonOilers,3dv0dp,RedOilSaints,3,Sun Jul 19 21:02:09 2015 UTC,"I'll be honest, I'm really hyped about this season. Moreso than I have been in the past. I think McLellan is going to have a massive effect on a number of players. Paramount of them is going to be Schultz and Yakupov. Yakupov will develop under McLellan and show what made him 1st overall. Schultz I think shows a better defensive game. CSP under McLellan is probably the most ideal situation you can have for a rookie. 65 points i my projection, but I could see him obliterating that number. I think Hall and RNH boom under McLellan too. PPG is my guess for both. I think Pou, Eberle and Purcell kind of hold steady of their production, but round out their game more. I think Kelfbom is seen as a top pairing guy by the end of the season. Nurse-Reinhart will develop into a top pairing.....in the AHL. Yes they spend the entire season down there and develop their games properly. I think Talbot continues to track into an above average goalie.   I think we snag a wildcard berth."
EdmontonOilers,3dv0dp,awful_astronaut,3,Sun Jul 19 22:02:09 2015 UTC,"I'd love to be that optimistic but I just don't see how adding a generational centre, continuing with a below average defense core and hoping/praying for league average goaltending translates into a 33-38 point increase needed to fight for a wildcard.  No question Vancouver falls out of a playoff spot, but I fully expect the Kings to pickup their slack. Who else declines enough for us to snag a playoff berth? I can see Winnipeg regressing if their goaltending slumps. I would have picked Calgary to come crashing back to earth, but with the addition of Hamilton I'm not sure sure.  I feel like for us to make the playoffs we need Vancouver to fall like they're expected to, Dubnyk to come back down to reality, and Pavlic to go cold. Kings, Stars, and Oilers squeak into the playoffs.  Realistically I would like to see us somewhere in the mid 80's for points. I would be ecstatic if we touched 90 at year end. 2016-2017 we should be fighting for our division."
EdmontonOilers,3dv0dp,Moosecavalry,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:19:44 2015 UTC,"I think coaching is going to have a massive effect on this team. McLellan not only represents an NHL caliber coach, but a top-10 NHL coach in my opinion.   You're absolutely right we're hoping that Talbot turns into a legitimate goalie and a sub-par defense can atleast play at an average level. My thinking is McLellan's system is going to help that. He plays one where his teams hold on to the puck and generate lots of shots. His Sharks have been top 10 in GA for every season but the last one. While he had decent players, I don't think it was a top-10 defense he was rolling out.   Where we should really see some dominance is from the forward group. Like you said, a generational center added to a roster filled with young talent. McLellan's system should see most if not all of these guys flourish.   IIRC, we were playing at a 70 point pace under Nelson. This is without adding a top-pairing PMD (Sekera), generational C, potential starting goalie (Talbot) and a top 10 NHL coach. I could see that being a 20 point swing."

EdmontonOilers,3dt4vp,Lemon_Cola,15,Sun Jul 19 05:06:09 2015 UTC,"Assuming the roster as of today:  Canada: Hall, McDavid  Russia: Yakupov  Sweden: Klefbom  Slovakia: Sekera  Finland: Korpikoski  Outside shot: Lander (SWE), Eberle (CAN), Nugent-Hopkins (CAN), Fayne (USA)"
EdmontonOilers,3dt4vp,YouJagaloon,5,Sun Jul 19 05:13:23 2015 UTC,"I could see Eberle/Nugent-Hopkins winning the Matt Duchene slot in the 2018 roster. They might need a player or two to take an injury to crack the main roster, but Eberle might get a Hall/McDavid bump (assuming they make the team) and Nuge fits the young-gun riding shotgun mould pretty well."
EdmontonOilers,3dt4vp,Icekommander,7,Sun Jul 19 07:54:22 2015 UTC,"For Canada - After his showing with Crosby: Hall for sure. Eberle maybe but probably not. McDavid definitely could, but Crosby didn't play in 06 so I wouldn't be surprised if he was left out due to experience. Nurse might just have a shot depending on how he and the Canadian defensive scene develop. From this years team, I wouldn't be completely surprised if none of Keith, Hamhuis or Bouwmeester come back next Olympics and even Weber/Seabrook might just be past their prime. I'd guess Pietrangelo and Giordano make it next time around. I also hear Fowler is pretty good. The other replacements are too much of a toss up to predict at this point in my opinion. Ekblad, Rielly, Hamilton and maybe Murray are probably in Nurse's group as ""the next wave"" of Canadian defencemen. I'd bet that most of them wait til 2022 though.  Love Nuge, think he probably has the talent but I get the feeling he won't get the recognition in time.  Todd Mclellan?  Sweden - Klefbom certainly could. Lander has an outside shot based on his performance at the WHC. If Nilsson is competent then he could sneak in as a backup goalie. Sweden has pretty bad goalie depth with Lundquvist as the only established tender.  Russia - Yak obviously has a reasonable shot.  Slovakia - Sekera for sure. (sidenote: I get weirdly excited when I remember Sekera is an Oiler)Marincin again.  Germany - Draisaitl obviously.  I think USA will be too strong at defence for Fayne to cut it with Jones, Myers, Trouba all coming up."
EdmontonOilers,3dt4vp,oddspellingofPhreid,10,Sun Jul 19 05:32:21 2015 UTC,"I don't think they'll sit McDavid in 2018. He'll be in his third year of the NHL in 2017-2018, whereas Sid was only in his first in 2005-2006. Another comparable might be Drew Doughty, who played in his second NHL year in 2010."
EdmontonOilers,3dt4vp,Icekommander,2,Sun Jul 19 06:59:57 2015 UTC,"True. It also depends on just how good McDavid is. If he's Crosby-level then he'll likely make it. If he's Kane-level, maybe not."
EdmontonOilers,3dt4vp,oddspellingofPhreid,5,Sun Jul 19 07:03:50 2015 UTC,"If he and Hall end up playing together on the Oilers roster, I think they both make it even if he is ""only"" elite and not generational. Hockey Canada seems to like their duos -- most famously Kunitz got the Crosby bump, but I think from the 2014 roster Sharp and Bouwmeester both made it over other edge players from their familiarity with Toews and Pietrangelo respectively. But even if Hall and McDavid end up separate lines, I still think any non-bust McDavid beats out guys like Duchene for the 13th/14th roster spots."

EdmontonOilers,3dqf9d,IamMcLovin2015,14,Sat Jul 18 13:14:40 2015 UTC,"An easy one is Griffin Reinhart (he's technically a prospect, right?). Aside from having one of the coolest names in the NHL he's proved that he can be a sturdy defenseman. He was dipping in Long Island so a change in scenery and a new system might help his development. From the outset, we knew that a lot of his problems started with his skating. He's not awful at skating, but he's nothing special. (If you've got Patty Kane and Reinhart wheeling towards the corner to get a puck, nine times out of ten, Kane is going to get it.) If his skating improves and he ups his confidence/drive (I personally did not see him play in NYI, but I heard one of his issues was playing with the tenacity that he had in junior) then this polarizing trade could be called a win for us. Well, that's mere speculation for the most part.   I like Dillon Simpson, as well. He's in the same mold as GR -- stay-at-home D with questionable skating and inconsistent puck skills, but that's all stuff that can be learned. He's still young; he's still a project, but let's take our time with him."
EdmontonOilers,3dqf9d,imnotswedishreally,3,Sat Jul 18 13:59:57 2015 UTC,"The thing I like about Reinhart is that he plays a very smart & reliable game. I wonder if sometimes his ""skating issues"" are over-stated? Because often times big men can look a bit slow just because it takes them less effort to get up to the same speed as a smaller guy. In any case, he's not a guy who's going to be caught out of position very often like I worry about Nurse. I think he'd be a perfect partner for Schultz... Schultz would definitely thrive playing with someone as dependable as Reinhart."

But I guess we'll see where everyone is at in comparison to each other at training camp. There are a few very good prospects battling for maybe 1 spot."
EdmontonOilers,3dqf9d,McEirhead,4,Sat Jul 18 19:49:59 2015 UTC,"I watch the Islanders a lot so I can back up what you were saying, he's definitely a project in that sense (which is why we were able to get a former 4th overall in a trade where we sent 16th overall) but his upside is huge (much like he is) and I think it's too early to say we ""won"" the trade but I think it was, at the very least, a mutually beneficial one."

EdmontonOilers,3dn363,Icekommander,2,Fri Jul 17 20:05:34 2015 UTC,You might be onto something! 32 percent of the Oilers picks played 50+ NHL games which is the most of all teams I've studied so far (tied with Columbus and Anaheim who also have 32 percent).   From the 32 percent only 23 percent played more than 100 games which is pretty low compared to Anaheim and Columbus who both have 26 percent playing 100+ games.
EdmontonOilers,3dn363,Icekommander,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:14:09 2015 UTC,"What percentage was typical in terms of players who had more than 200 games? Just at quick perusal, McDonald, MA Pouliot, Jean-Francois Jacques, Troy Bodie, Rob Schremp, Liam Reddox, Chris VandeVelde (who is a unique case as I think this last season was his first full season, but probably got some games in Edmonton he shouldn't have) and Theo Peckham all got stuck in the 100-200 game zone. Those guys were all drafted from about 2003-2006, and would have been playing in the late 2000s and early 2010s when the team sputtered out, and then started the rebuild with Hall."

Edmonton and Anaheim are tied for the biggest percentage drop between players who have played 100+ GP and 200+ GP.  The average is a 7 percent drop between players who have 100+ GP and players who have 200+ GP.

EdmontonOilers,3dkatk,imnotswedishreally,9,Thu Jul 16 23:23:46 2015 UTC,"I don't know about being better than Seth.  Seth's game is really solid all-around.  He's like Bouwmeester - not especially flashy - but very effective, but with a higher ceiling - Ryan Suter is a great comparable.  Hard to beat that.  Nurse is going to be more in the Subban mould.  Likes to hit, likes to shoot, likes to get physical, skates fast.  He's way, WAY too aggressive positionally so he'll have the same positioning issues.  Doesn't have the scoring touch, but is bigger and just as fast.  Nurse will be flashier and will hit and please the crowds, he'll be the kind of guy who gathers attention through style of play. He'll be Subban with half the offensive numbers and just as many big hits.  If he ever learns patience and calms down, his upside is Pronger but I don't think he's likely to achieve it.  IMO I'd take Ryan Suter over a 30-point Subban any day.  But it sure will be fun to watch Nurse play and if he ever learns to be calm on the ice, he will be the better player.  As for Ristolainen, I can't speak of that because I haven't seen him enough."
EdmontonOilers,3dkatk,defeatedbird,2,Fri Jul 17 02:36:09 2015 UTC,Yeah Nurse takes way too many risks and that stuff isn't gonna cut it in the NHL. He definitely needs time in the AHL to learn to cut that stuff out.
EdmontonOilers,3dkatk,tsn123456789,0,Fri Jul 17 15:16:09 2015 UTC,Good comparable.  I'd add Nurse is a better skater with Subban having a better shot.
EdmontonOilers,3dkatk,parecon,9,Fri Jul 17 13:33:32 2015 UTC,"i think the first couple years of Nurse's career are going to have an equal number of instances on sportscenter where he is smiling, and where he is very angry with himself. He has been a reckless player so far in many cases, with his incredible athleticism making up for it at lower levels. It's about to get a lot harder to make up for a mental error and I suspect he'll have to learn that the hard way. Most young Defensemen have some growing pains.   With that said I think he's the kind of guy that will get through it, and I'm very excited about his prospects for being a true number one D-man. He has done everything the team asked so far in an effort to get to the league, and there has been no indication that his attitude is going to change. He obviously has the tools, and he hasn't been called out for a lack of intelligence anywhere. He'll do what he's told, and with this staff it'll be the right thing.   As far as not being in the league faster: Jones was more ready out of the box and RR was rushed up; I don't think it's an issue at this point. If Nurse spends a chunk of this year in the AHL it still shouldn't be a concern. Now if they have the opportunity to call him up and they don't, I'll start to worry a bit, I mean if Schultz gets hurt, Hunt could be the call up for that role, but outside that one instance I think Nurse is your guy if he's not already on the big club."
EdmontonOilers,3dkatk,A5hcrack,15,Fri Jul 17 00:21:10 2015 UTC,"Personally I think nurse is going to be the best defensemen in that draft, and I'm pretty sure it won't even be close."
EdmontonOilers,3dkatk,munzi187,14,Fri Jul 17 00:03:39 2015 UTC,"I feel like there is a bit of home team blindness here. Don't get me wrong, I fully expect Nurse to be a beast but Seth Jones is no shitebag.   I'm not saying I don't think Nurse can be better but the ""Won't even be close"" isn't giving Jones the respect he deserves I feel."
EdmontonOilers,3dkatk,KingDave46,2,Fri Jul 17 14:06:27 2015 UTC,"I'm not saying I don't think Nurse can be better but the ""Won't even be close"" isn't giving Jones the respect he deserves I feel.   This is the most important part. Nurse is a great prospect and down the road could have some seasons better than Jones but Jones is already establishing himself as a core part of Nashville's Defense, which is tough as fuck to do all things considered. Jones is a real up-and-coming player in the NHL and discounting him is just bad hockey sense."
EdmontonOilers,3dkatk,foucaultliker,1 point,Sat Jul 18 19:44:08 2015 UTC,"Just because nurse hasn't cracked the lineup yet, and Jones has, doesn't make him the superior player. There was a reason he dropped 3 spots to number 4 in his draft year.   Jones is going to be a hell of a defensemen, but he's not the all around player Darnell nurse is. If everything else is equal between them, Jones may get a few more points, but nurse is a hell of a lot stronger, meaner, faster and better positionally. I'd call that a better defensemen.   Let's gather after next season and compare notes."
EdmontonOilers,3dkatk,munzi187,3,Tue Jul 21 16:45:09 2015 UTC,"I can't tell if our boy's development is slower than the 4th and 8th picks in 2013 or if we're taking our sweet sweet time with him.   The latter. His numbers and success in junior has progressed very nicely.   But I think if you watch him, you can see why management might be hesitant bringing him straight up to the NHL. He appears to be modelling his game after bobby Orr, when honestly, he'd be better served modelling it after Chris Pronger. Orr loved carrying the puck, and I got nothing against a defenceman who wants to carry the puck, but his results will diminish in the NHL... And on top of that, teams will punish you for your defensive mistakes. A 2 on 1 from Kane and Toews is almost certainly in the back of the net.  Pronger was a monster on the blue line, he could skate in the puck like the best of them, but more often he gained zone with his laser pass to his forwards. Now I know Nurse is never going to be Pronger, but at the NHL he's going to need to balance out the passing portion of his game. If he can do that, he'll be a #1 for sure!! But if he doesn't, he'll be a defensively liable, 2-way, top4 guy with a lot of grit."

EdmontonOilers,3dj40v,envague,3,Thu Jul 16 18:47:54 2015 UTC,"According to Stauffer it's a 2-way contract, 585k."
EdmontonOilers,3dj40v,oil83,3,Thu Jul 16 20:33:04 2015 UTC,"Hold onto him, see what he's got. Maybe we are finally successfully developing defenceman"
EdmontonOilers,3dj40v,JimRoepcke,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:38:01 2015 UTC,"The $85K AHL salary is disappointing. That'll make him an attractive waiver option. If they wanted to keep him they should have offered him more.  Then again, perhaps Davidson knew he wouldn't make the Oilers and wanted to be an attractive waiver option, so he negotiated a lower salary????"
EdmontonOilers,3dj40v,A5hcrack,2,Thu Jul 16 21:28:30 2015 UTC,"I would have been pushing for buyouts in the defense even without the Reinhart trade, and if Nurse had been traded somehow, because of how this kid played when he was brought up. He was a solid looking player, unlike a lot of the call ups at the end and I personally think he's going to spend significant time in the league. Unfortunately (or fortunately depending on perspective) he's buried behind a big free agent signing and three prospects for his natural position in the league. Unlike Reinhart or Nurse who I would like to see getting minutes, or in the AHL, I'd be perfectly comfortable with Davidson as the seventh D-man if it shook out that way."
EdmontonOilers,3dj40v,TweetPoster,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:47:16 2015 UTC,"If there was no politics or big contracts influencing decisions, I think our best opening night roster would be     LD RD    Sekera Fayne   Klefbom Schultz   Nurse Gryba   Davidson     Unfortunately it's going to be really tough to bury/move both Ference and Nikitin."

EdmontonOilers,3dffxm,ShittiusMaximus,6,Wed Jul 15 21:13:42 2015 UTC,"If it worked for Thornton, Marleau, Burns etc... I'm sure it'll work out well for them. Veterans adjust much easier than younger players, and I don't think it'll be a problem for them at all. If Nikitin stays, I think he'll bounce back, but he won't ever live up to that $4.5M contract. As for Purcell, I think he'll bounce back as well. He had by far the worst year of his NHL career last year, and I think he'll be very motivated to be better. McLellan is a Vet who will help him get back on track and if all goes well for him he should get 45+ points."
EdmontonOilers,3dffxm,Shottaz83,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:11:12 2015 UTC,"If it worked for Thornton, Marleau, Burns etc.   That's sort of the question I have about McLellan.  Did he work out for those guys, or did they work out for him?"
EdmontonOilers,3dffxm,defeatedbird,5,Fri Jul 17 21:46:59 2015 UTC,"I'll take your question another direction... McLellan's system will help our veterans play better because they will know what they need to do. The Oilers under Eakins played confused. No one knew what a swarm was, or how to play it effectively... and I don't think Eakins really knew how to teach that. The communication with Eakins was substandard for this club. Eakins was like Mr. Burns in the Simpson's Softball episode where he kept telling Roger Clemens to shave his sideburns and Clemens had no idea what he meant.  McLellan seems to be a much better communicator."

EdmontonOilers,3dffxm,Andy-Martin,3,Sat Jul 18 20:43:21 2015 UTC,"I would say Purcell has the better chance of the two to rebound. The depth of the forward group is significantly better than it was a year ago, despite the relatively few moves. This year's potential line mates being Draisaitl and Lander,  Hall and McDavid, or Pouliot and Nugent-Hopkins give him a much higher chance of producing than he had last year if only by virtue of better line mates. At the very least he is more likely to build value for a trade deadline deal on any of those three lines.   If you swap Sekera for Petry; it's not that much better if Nikitin is on the roster. Just having Nikitin on the roster means Nurse and Reinhart are likely not, which puts the D-group not much better than last year. A better system in place will help, but last year's defensive core was brutal."
EdmontonOilers,3dffxm,A5hcrack,3,Wed Jul 15 23:20:25 2015 UTC,"I think as whole we will see a better product. If players like Purcell, NN, Ference  and Shultz have any pride  at all they'll be putting in a better and hopefully more cerebral effort this year. I say cerebral because these players need to think about how they can play within their abilities more than anything."

EdmontonOilers,3df0bt,Shottaz83,22,Wed Jul 15 19:26:29 2015 UTC,"The more I hear about Eakins, the more I dislike him. It seems like nobody liked playing for him at all. He somehow came in and made a bad team even worse. I didn't even know that was possible when we hired him. Mac-T really fucked up by hiring him, especially the way he did it as well. Everything I've heard about McLellan has been the exact opposite though. Players really like playing for him, and he's had a lot of success as well. Schultz did have a bad year last year, but he did still lead our D-Men in points. If McLellan can get him back on track and not play him nearly 25 minutes a night, he could have a big year. Our D-Core is better this year, and Schultz wont be relied on so heavily. All signs point to him having a good year, so I really hope he does. I'd like to see him hit 40+ points this year."
EdmontonOilers,3df0bt,ShittiusMaximus,13,Wed Jul 15 19:57:31 2015 UTC,"Me too. I thought krueger was awesome, and his career since has just done more to reinforce that idea. They chose an unproven guy over what looks to be one of the great minds in sports right now. Worse than that it kinda looks like they did it all over a bit of pride. Like it was all just so MacT could have his guy coaching instead of tambo's. It really bums me out."
EdmontonOilers,3df0bt,falsekoala,11,Wed Jul 15 20:09:56 2015 UTC,Eakins always said all the right things in interviews and pressers. I think he really pulled the fast one on MacT and all of us convincing us that he was an NHL coach. His ironman background and being a fitness nut gave a lot of hope to the fans  Remember when it made headlines that he had just healthy food for members of the press. Didn't want his players eating doughnuts
EdmontonOilers,3df0bt,tsn123456789,6,Wed Jul 15 21:21:35 2015 UTC,Eakins ran out of things to say about the team sucking pretty quick though.
EdmontonOilers,3df0bt,NeverEverComments,2,Wed Jul 15 22:05:50 2015 UTC,"I don't even care about his offense, if he can just shore up his defense that's a big plus in my books."

EdmontonOilers,3df0bt,ProfessorScribbles,1 point,Thu Jul 16 01:33:30 2015 UTC,"This makes perfect sense to me. It's a tear down/build up mentality. Old school type mentality. Some people don't react well to it. Schultz obviously didn't. I imagine for Schultz it was just confusing and tiresome. Being on the ice for five minutes straight and thinking, ""but this guys just said how shit I am and we are down four goals."""
EdmontonOilers,3df0bt,shweet44722,3,Thu Jul 16 16:43:27 2015 UTC,Mild hype? I don't like the lasting implications of a Nikitin buyout and him being on the books for another year but at least he'll be gone.
EdmontonOilers,3df0bt,shweet44722,4,Wed Jul 15 19:39:11 2015 UTC,"My flair says otherwise, but we should wait for the news IMO rather than going with what Bob says, considering what happened prior to, and during, the draft."
EdmontonOilers,3df0bt,shweet44722,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:30:10 2015 UTC,"I know, but it's fun to talk about this stuff in the off season.   Honestly I'm hoping he's wrong. I'd rather they buy out ference."
EdmontonOilers,3df0bt,notsoyoungpadawan,2,Wed Jul 15 20:35:49 2015 UTC,"True. It's just that Bob has lead fans astray as of late is all.  I'd rather bite the bullet on both for the time being. We can bury Nikitin in Bakersfield if someone kicks him out of his position, and Ference's buyout will be much cheaper next season. On top of that, we lose Purcell and Nikitin's contracts next season, which frees up a lot of cap. Buying them out this year doesn't make a whole lot of sense unless we have someone to replace that, and although Reinhart or Nurse may be close, we don't know how well they'll be able to handle NHL play as of yet."
EdmontonOilers,3df0bt,notsoyoungpadawan,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:55:09 2015 UTC,No but someone like erhoff could be a good pick up if we get some off that money off the books.
EdmontonOilers,3df0bt,supertroll1999,2,Wed Jul 15 21:04:58 2015 UTC,"Not for the money he's asking, and we'd still have a good chunk of Nikitin's money for this season."
EdmontonOilers,3df0bt,notsoyoungpadawan,4,Wed Jul 15 21:15:26 2015 UTC,"he said that Dallas "" beat the shit out of him"" in the room last year.   Interesting claim. If Dallas really hated him that much why did he constantly play him on the top pairing and the top PP? Doesn't really add up."
EdmontonOilers,3df0bt,papercutpete,3,Wed Jul 15 21:21:56 2015 UTC,"Well in terms of scoring defensemen for the PP he didn't really have many options did he? But top minutes yeah you're not wrong there, especially when you consider how little ice time yak saw when we all know eakins didn't like him.   But that having been said yak wasn't our star defensive prospect, he is a young star but we have lots of forwards in that category. Maybe eakins was under instruction from management to let Schultz play but didn't really like him so he took the opportunity when he got it to rip into him.   Of course that is a TON of speculation for which I have no basis. So don't think I'm trying to misrepresent any of this as what was actually happening."
EdmontonOilers,3df0bt,falsekoala,-4,Wed Jul 15 21:36:27 2015 UTC,"Well in terms of scoring defensemen for the PP he didn't really have many options did he?   I think anyone who was capable of not turning the puck over from point would've been a much better option.   Maybe eakins was under instruction from management to let Schultz play but didn't really like him so he took the opportunity when he got it to rip into him.   If that's true, I'm glad MacT has fucked off to whatever interim position he's in now.   Of course that is a TON of speculation for which I have no basis. So don't think I'm trying to misrepresent any of this as what was actually happening.   Oh, I know. My post was about Bob's claim's inaccuracy, not yours."
EdmontonOilers,3df0bt,McEirhead,2,Wed Jul 15 21:39:56 2015 UTC,"Well it could be that Bob is just doing what Bob does, which is building excitement for the team he works for. But I've heard good things about the assistant coach tmac hired in terms of defensive development so I'm really hoping he can do great things with Schultz, nurse, klefbom, and reinhart. I just can't even imagine how strong our d could look in a few years time if those four guys develop to their potential. It makes me feel things in places haha."
EdmontonOilers,3df0bt,falsekoala,0,Wed Jul 15 21:56:50 2015 UTC,"I remember reading somewhere that it was included in his contract; minimum amount of ice time, PP mins, etc. Take it with a grain of salt though, I have no idea where I heard that.   Still a definite possibility though, and it makes sense."

EdmontonOilers,3dejx0,TheWildRover_,7,Wed Jul 15 20:04:54 2015 UTC,"I agree with you, he was picked on quite a bit for playing outside his abilities.

EdmontonOilers,3dejx0,InvisibleEnemy,4,Wed Jul 15 20:41:13 2015 UTC,Fellow Jultz supporter checking in.  No doubt he's gonna figure it out defensively.  It's not like every single D man during Voldemort's reign wasn't brutal.

EdmontonOilers,3dejx0,highflyer83,2,Wed Jul 15 20:14:49 2015 UTC,"I believe the majority of fans are in the same boat as you, it's just the other 29 teams."
EdmontonOilers,3dejx0,Rulebreaking,19,Fri Jul 17 00:28:41 2015 UTC,"Its a no risk win/win deal for us. If he performs well under McLellan and with a stronger D-Core around him, then we extend him. If he doesn't, we flip him at the deadline and get some assets for him.  Edit: Also you can blame this all on Mac-T for giving him so much and forcing Chias hand here. Chia did exceptionally well with the mess Mac-T made of Schultz' contract."
EdmontonOilers,3dejx0,Shottaz83,7,Wed Jul 15 17:36:29 2015 UTC,Schultz was interesting last year. He wasn't signed until really late in August so my guess is he was holding out for a long term deal and MacT didn't want to give it to him so he negotiated an 800k raise (cap hit wise) on a prove-me contract.
EdmontonOilers,3dejx0,tsn123456789,4,Wed Jul 15 18:35:39 2015 UTC,"Most of MacTs contracts were pretty terrible. Nikitin, Ference and Gordon. Pouliot and Fayne are slight overpays for what we got, but not terrible. The 1 good one is going to be Nuge's."
EdmontonOilers,3dejx0,McEirhead,7,Wed Jul 15 18:48:59 2015 UTC,Fayne was a steal at his cap hit. Pouliot was an overpay at the time but now it looks okay. Gordon was a little overpaid but he was a solid addition to the roster and actually earned his paycheck. You can debate Ference but at the time I think the opinions were split about him; don't mind the cap hit but do mind the term plus NMC. Nikitin was universally panned though.
EdmontonOilers,3dejx0,tsn123456789,2,Wed Jul 15 18:59:10 2015 UTC,"Disagree about Fayne. Ya he looks like a freakin Norris candidate compared to the rest of Edmonton's defence, but guys with his production numbers usually sign contracts on winning team in around the 2 - 2.5M range. I'm not saying it's terrible, but I'd bet you it was the highest offer his agent was able to wrangle."
EdmontonOilers,3dejx0,McEirhead,3,Wed Jul 15 19:16:36 2015 UTC,MacT also had to deal with no mcdavid and no new management staff to assist in luring talent here. He had zero leverage.
EdmontonOilers,3dejx0,MixBlender,2,Thu Jul 16 00:08:52 2015 UTC,"Yep, his contracts we're really bad. Chia had no leverage here because of what Mac-T did, so I think he did great given what he was dealing with."
EdmontonOilers,3dejx0,Shottaz83,15,Wed Jul 15 19:02:34 2015 UTC,Just so everyone here knows. We could not sign him for less then his previous contract. It had to be greater than or equal to his old one
EdmontonOilers,3dejx0,A5hcrack,3,Wed Jul 15 18:05:08 2015 UTC,Unless the arbitrator had decided otherwise; correct? If it was happening before then it had to be the same or more.
EdmontonOilers,3dejx0,TheTravellingMan,4,Wed Jul 15 18:07:24 2015 UTC,The Mediator can only lower his pay by 15% and that would have been a tough thing to convince him of considering Jultz was our highest scoring D-man and had the most TOI (or near it). I'm not a fan of the contract but the Oilers were between a rock and a hard place on this one.
EdmontonOilers,3dejx0,A5hcrack,2,Wed Jul 15 18:54:51 2015 UTC,"and by the time of the hearing, it's likely that anyone worth spending the cap space gained in buyouts would have found a new team to play for. And realistically the buyout window is likely the main reason for the arbitration in the first place. I'm glad it's done, looking forward to the weekend."
EdmontonOilers,3dejx0,ProfessorScribbles,8,Wed Jul 15 19:24:41 2015 UTC,Nobody needs a 'show me' contract more on this team than Schultz.  This eats up almost all of our remaining cap space; hoping we get a trade or buyout coming.
EdmontonOilers,3dejx0,Wurdfurd,15,Wed Jul 15 17:46:50 2015 UTC,Small price to pay for that buyout window...
EdmontonOilers,3dejx0,McEirhead,4,Wed Jul 15 17:44:36 2015 UTC,"Wager on who's gone this weekend?  Forwards are pretty good contract-wise, but there's a log-jam on defence - Nikitin would probably clear waivers, while Ference is stuck on the main club, and there's still a couple decent defenders available through free agency."
EdmontonOilers,3dejx0,9Bains,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:25:58 2015 UTC,"If there's a forward to go, Purcell would be the one on the way out, but Nikitin almost certainly, and Ference maybe, but I'm not sure."
EdmontonOilers,3dejx0,A5hcrack,1 point,Wed Jul 15 23:00:41 2015 UTC,Almost completely covered by a buyout of either Nikitin or Purcell alone. the wait begins.
EdmontonOilers,3dejx0,ryspot,3,Wed Jul 15 18:10:58 2015 UTC,Will he still be a RFA or will he be an UFA at the end of this?
EdmontonOilers,3dejx0,oddspellingofPhreid,6,Wed Jul 15 17:46:32 2015 UTC,Off the top of my head I believe he'll have one more year of rfa.
EdmontonOilers,3dejx0,shweet44722,5,Wed Jul 15 17:48:27 2015 UTC,"Yup, in 2016 he'll have 3 years experience and be 26, so still one more year of RFA."
EdmontonOilers,3dejx0,bigfatphony,5,Wed Jul 15 17:56:37 2015 UTC,"Even though they signed, I believe this still opens a second buy-out window. I think we may see more happening in the next little bit."
EdmontonOilers,3dejx0,YouJagaloon,6,Wed Jul 15 17:38:16 2015 UTC,"I find it hard to believe they needed to threaten arbitration to convince underperforming, overpaid Schultz to only get a $225k raise. Nikitin buyout has to be imminent."
EdmontonOilers,3dejx0,bigfatphony,6,Wed Jul 15 17:41:08 2015 UTC,"Ya, I'm sure they set this whole thing in motion specifically for that buyout window. Schultz was probably informed of that too.   Could be because they have something planned, could be just for flexibility. We'll see..."
EdmontonOilers,3dejx0,pheoxs,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:08:34 2015 UTC,While I agree Schultz under-performed. Him / his agent were probably trying to argue that being the #1 D on the team (based on TOI / points / usage last year under Eakins) that he deserved more
EdmontonOilers,3dejx0,trippymane9,5,Thu Jul 16 15:54:07 2015 UTC,Great value and better term. Prove the doubters wrong Schultz!
EdmontonOilers,3dejx0,Wurdfurd,13,Wed Jul 15 17:36:04 2015 UTC,Good term? Yes.  Good value right now? Not by a long shot.  Potential for being good value later this year under TMac? Decent
EdmontonOilers,3dejx0,broccolifucker,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:45:35 2015 UTC,"Agreed on the first two, especially the second. Won't be holding my breath on the third at all. Personally, and I know this has got to be nutty to most, but as long as he's here at all, I'd love to see, even for just a five game stint or something, what he'd be like as a winger. I just don't see his defensive play improving, and he's not even at least a big, heavy guy, back there. Petry surprised me with his improvement last season, and I used to hate him, so that's cool, but I honestly don't even know if I care for Schultz to 'prove me wrong.' This whole 'superstar offensive-defenseman' experiment has run its course."
EdmontonOilers,3dejx0,oddspellingofPhreid,3,Wed Jul 15 18:26:17 2015 UTC,Oy. Not practical but good value would have been 2.5-3 imo. Here's to hoping he earns it. I'd love to find out he's a top 4 defenceman.
EdmontonOilers,3dejx0,smexeh,5,Wed Jul 15 17:44:42 2015 UTC,you can't offer RFA's less money than their previous contract
EdmontonOilers,3dejx0,9Bains,3,Wed Jul 15 18:28:50 2015 UTC,"You can bring the price of a contract down, it's called reverse arbitration, but the type of arbitration case that Chiarelli agreed to enter didn't allow a reduction in pay for Schultz."
EdmontonOilers,3dejx0,oddspellingofPhreid,0,Wed Jul 15 23:25:38 2015 UTC,That is not even close to true.
EdmontonOilers,3dejx0,YouJagaloon,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:46:25 2015 UTC,I think the difference in that case is the 1-way vs. 2-way. By RFA rules he would have been entitled to a 10% raise ($990k) but it would have had to be the same 2-way contract as his previous deal. Instead he accepted a lower value for a 1-way contract.  There was never a chance Schultz took less than $3.6M considering he was guaranteed it by the qualifying offer.
EdmontonOilers,3dejx0,oddspellingofPhreid,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:15:09 2015 UTC,"Exactly my point with Lander.  You don't have to qualify a RFA to sign him. See: Riley Nash.  Hence the ""practicality"" mention in my op.  Edit: in case readers are still confused, a qualifying offer is NOT a minimum offer. It's a minimum offer that can be declined where the team can still maintain a players rights. You can offer less if you think a player will sign for less."
EdmontonOilers,3dejx0,answerphoned1d6,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:22:57 2015 UTC,"So I have a poor understanding of all this.  If we don't qualify Schultz before July 1, we lose his rights, correct?  Then he's free to sign with anyone, including us?  Qualifying him though means we have to pay him at least as much as he made last year?"
EdmontonOilers,3dejx0,oddspellingofPhreid,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:43:29 2015 UTC,Exactly. I believe he's also free to sign for a lower salary as an RFA if he thinks it's in his best interest. That one I'm a little hazy on though.
EdmontonOilers,3dejx0,morwr,0,Wed Jul 15 20:47:20 2015 UTC,"I'm always surprised by what a drastic difference there is in AHL/NHL pay. Playing in the AHL he makes less than me, playing in the NHL he makes 10 times my salary."

EdmontonOilers,3dejx0,notsoyoungpadawan,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:50:16 2015 UTC,"When I heard Chia speak about Jultz in one of his interviews, it was clear that they had already agreed to terms (i think it was on the same day we announced we would go to arbitration). This whole arbitration thing has been a tactical ploy to give us a chance to buy-out one of the D-men to facilitate a trade IMO.  Side note: Buy-out window lasts for 48 hours after Jultz signs his contract, so if Chia really did do this to buy someone out, expect some news in this regard by later tonight or tomorrow and news of a trade by Friday at the max."
EdmontonOilers,3dejx0,9Bains,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:27:45 2015 UTC,"I thought the exact same about the deal being all but signed, but I expect that the buy out to happen towards the end of the window for 2 reasons. One, Chia seems like he's very calculating and would want to make sure he's doing the right thing, and two, I think he wants some big news to separate the two so he doesn't seem as calculating. If Franson gets signed for big money in the next few hours, or the Leafs do something expect him to make his buyouts as it wouldn't even make the news."
EdmontonOilers,3dejx0,notsoyoungpadawan,1 point,Wed Jul 15 23:22:13 2015 UTC,"I don't think Chia will buy out anyone just for the sake of buying them out. We really have no need to buy out Nikitin, as we could just as easily bury him in the minors for a year if we can't find a good deal. Only reason we would want to buy Nikitin out is if we manage to get another defenceman on a 5m+ contract, since our cap space right now is around $3.5m only. Buying out Nikitin would give us the cap space we require to sign an elite D-man."
EdmontonOilers,3dejx0,9Bains,1 point,Thu Jul 16 00:10:37 2015 UTC,"What I meant was that Chia would do a kind of cost/benefit thing for the overall team to determine what's best.   As I see it:  The cost of a buyout $1.5M on the books next season, the benefit is he frees up a space as we have potentially 9-10 Dmen that can play in the 7 spots right now.  The cost of burying him in the minors is that the AHL is a development league and having him in a league where the number of games have been contracted from last hinders player development. The benefit is that the $4.5M contract frees up more space.  The cost of doing nothing is we have an ineffective $4.5M player on the roster, the benefit is that he is a veteran that can help the the young guys and buy them time, and who knows, he might be better next year."
EdmontonOilers,3dejx0,SuperMurabitoBros,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:10:17 2015 UTC,"ONE MORE YEAR OF NORRIS! Jokes aside: I think with less swarm, more organization, and not top minutes with shoddy 3rd pairing d-men (cough Nikitin, Ference, Hunt) or rookies..Schultz will be good and serve a niche."
EdmontonOilers,3dejx0,stitzy1,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:22:54 2015 UTC,It sucks that occurs Oduya went for so cheap...Jultz is a bust in my opinion
EdmontonOilers,3dejx0,McEirhead,3,Wed Jul 15 19:59:30 2015 UTC,"Give him another year... I know he won't suddenly turn into Chris Chelios or Shea Weber, but he's definitely shown the potential to be a top producing defender in the league. So even if that means we gotta cut back his 5on5 time, you know he'll still be on the #1 PP unit. 3.9 is hardly an overpay for a PP specialist if he can produce north of 40 points.  The entire team regressed under Eakins. I expect production rates at least as good as his 2012-13 season this year, which puts him at 46 points or better."
EdmontonOilers,3dejx0,stitzy1,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:18:08 2015 UTC,"Ya, I have hope for him, and with the way the team is shaping up this year I feel that everyone will be motivated to train/play their best, gonna be an interesting year for sure."
EdmontonOilers,3dejx0,oddspellingofPhreid,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:29:04 2015 UTC,Oduya would be another Ference. He's 34 already and is basically baby-sat by Hjalmarsson. 3.9 mil for two years is going to make him a whipping boy in Dallas.
EdmontonOilers,3dejx0,YouJagaloon,-1,Thu Jul 16 14:26:59 2015 UTC,"I can't believe he got a raise. He was overpaid last year, and was outperformed by a mile by his closest comparable last year, Tyson Barrie, who makes $2.6M."
EdmontonOilers,3dejx0,Arunatic5,5,Wed Jul 15 17:38:35 2015 UTC,"We can't pay him any less than $3.675M. It's only a one year deal. When Barrie turns 25 (Schultz's age in 2 years time), he'll likely be paid $4+ in a new contract."
EdmontonOilers,3dejx0,YouJagaloon,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:42:46 2015 UTC,"I know we can't pay him less, but he did not deserve a raise at all. Age aside, they have similar NHL experience, TOI, and are both RFAs for the length of the deals so they should have at least been in the same ballpark at the initial signing (especially since they were signed about a week apart). I'm mostly angry at MacT for paying him on potential instead of merit."
EdmontonOilers,3dejx0,Arunatic5,6,Wed Jul 15 17:48:09 2015 UTC,"I'm mostly angry at MacT for paying him on potential instead of merit.   If we didn't offer him that much, he would have signed elsewhere. There were numerous teams that recognized his potential and were willing to pay him for it. Unfortunately, he hasn't lived up to it so far at an NHL level. MacT offered him maximum possible (along with ever other team in the running for Schutlz) because we had no other defensive prospects outside of Klefbom and possibly Marincin at that time. Also important to remember that Schultz potential stock was so high, he was considered a Calder favourite at the beginning of the lockout shortened season."
EdmontonOilers,3dejx0,wallsallbrassbuttons,3,Wed Jul 15 18:15:41 2015 UTC,"That's not the problem. Schultz's first contract was laden with bonuses that he didn't meet, and qualifying offers are based only on actual paid salary. MacT by no means had to pay Schultz $3.675 million on his second contract. That's where the screw up was."
EdmontonOilers,3dejx0,Arunatic5,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:20:17 2015 UTC,Ah. My mistake. It was a 1 year $3.675M show me contract then. It'll be interesting to see how things work out from here.
EdmontonOilers,3dejx0,wallsallbrassbuttons,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:22:43 2015 UTC,"No problem. And yep, it was an expensive show-me contract. I'm quite interested to see what Chiarelli does with the buyout window."
EdmontonOilers,3dejx0,YouJagaloon,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:40:40 2015 UTC,"But when he signed his last deal he hadn't progressed at all from his decent rookie season. I would argue he took a step back. MacT signed him to a massive deal way over every other comparable with the promise that he would win a Norris one day. If a team offer sheeted him for a 1st and a 3rd, I would have taken that in a heartbeat."
EdmontonOilers,3dejx0,tsn123456789,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:25:16 2015 UTC,"That's a bit hyperbolic. Schultz last year was about 1M overpaid. It's certainly not ""a massive deal"" especially considering that it was one year. We all like to shit on Schultz for not improving after his rookie year but are okay with giving Yak a pass. Schultz has gone through a coaching carousel too and plays a much tougher position. We badly misused him; he was playing top pairing minutes at the end of last year and we never actually had someone to teach him how to play defense. He's a third pairing offensive D like Green or Franson, putting him in the top 4 is setting him up for failure."
EdmontonOilers,3dejx0,YouJagaloon,0,Wed Jul 15 18:52:59 2015 UTC,"The problem is it wasn't really just a 1 year deal. Paying him $3.6M last year means we had to pay him at least that much this year and next. Comparing him to Yak is a strawman argument. Yak isn't getting paid like a star so the standard he should be held to is lower.   Its not Schultz's fault that he was overpaid and overplayed. MacT and Eakins fucked up and there wasn't much Chia could do about it short of walking away or trading him for peanuts. Like I said above, I'm mostly angry at MacT."
EdmontonOilers,3dejx0,tsn123456789,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:01:36 2015 UTC,"I mean, 3.6M isn't being paid like a star, there are some ELCs who are higher than 3.6M and those are for 3 years, not one. It does suck that we have to qualify him at 3.6M but Schultz held out last year and this was the compromise; besides I don't think anyone predicted the entire team to regress this year (even Hall). He's certainly a better player if used and coached properly.  I agree Schultz is overpaid, but I'm surprised the reaction MacT is getting from fans when realistically 3M would be a pretty fair price for Schultz last year and even this year, so we're only lookin at a <1M overpayment. I could understand Nikitin, Eakins hiring etc. but Schultz is nowhere near the top of that list."
EdmontonOilers,3dejx0,tsn123456789,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:08:54 2015 UTC,"While overpaid, he's certainly not the worst value for his contract, I'd give that to Jake Gardiner. Barrie and Brodie were steals."
EdmontonOilers,3dejx0,shweet44722,-1,Wed Jul 15 18:39:09 2015 UTC,"So he got a .225M raise after a shitty season. Huh.  Well, better on the team than off I suppose. At least it's a 1 year, and he better damn well prove he's worth that money or he knows as well as anyone that he's not coming back."
EdmontonOilers,3dejx0,WilburTronix,4,Wed Jul 15 17:38:33 2015 UTC,If that doesn't put a fire under his ass than I don't know what will.  I'm rooting for him this year to get to the next level of his game.
EdmontonOilers,3dejx0,shweet44722,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:42:46 2015 UTC,"We're spending 3.9M on him and have him as an RFA, I certainly hope so too or he's not going to be worth anything in the trade market at that point."
EdmontonOilers,3dejx0,Arunatic5,7,Wed Jul 15 17:45:36 2015 UTC,"Well, he may have had a shitty season, but offensively, he was our best D. And we can't give him any less than last contract, so the raise is quite reasonable."
EdmontonOilers,3dejx0,ProfessorScribbles,5,Wed Jul 15 17:40:10 2015 UTC,"Actually, offensively Klefbom was our best D in 5x5 scoring per 60 minutes TOI.  Schultz got fed some pretty easy minutes and big opportunities on the PP.    That said, Schultz I think has the highest offensive potential of all of our young D barring maybe Nurse, so hopefully he can turn it around this year under new management and with better defensive teammates."
EdmontonOilers,3dejx0,Arunatic5,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:50:38 2015 UTC,"I consider PP to be an important part of the offence, when I made my statement, but I understand what's being said. People are being so emotional about the $3.9 for 1 year, when we only gave him a 225K raise and a show me contract to prove himself (and get rid of if he doesn't achieve the necessary level of play)."
EdmontonOilers,3dejx0,shweet44722,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:18:08 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I mean don't get me wrong I didn't see him getting less money, and the raise isn't actually as bad as I was expecting, but I guess for me it's still the issue that he hasn't improved at all in the last 3 years, even while being our best offensive defenceman.  That can be said for a few players though, so we'll see what happens this year."
EdmontonOilers,3dejx0,haterbehatin,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:46:54 2015 UTC,By this one he seems to be improving although he still has a long ways to go before he'd be a good top 4 rather than a guy who should be your offensive 3rd pairing guy.
EdmontonOilers,3dejx0,shweet44722,2,Wed Jul 15 17:59:27 2015 UTC,"Well that's the issue for me, is the value. I mean we couldn't really pay him less, which sucks. but 3.9M for a guy who hasn't proven he can defend well enough to play the top 4D minutes we need is an issue. Then again, it's only a 1 year term so I guess if he ups his game and proves his worth than the contract isn't bad.  Biggest issue above all for me is the trade aspect. If he sucks again this year, then whatever team wants to acquire him needs to foot the bill for the 3.9M+ and we're going to get very little in return."
EdmontonOilers,3dejx0,haterbehatin,2,Wed Jul 15 18:03:53 2015 UTC,His shot generation one seems to have grown a lot too.   I think he's had an issue that he's been played too much often with poor partners and struggled at least in part because of that.   It's a big year for him but given that he should play less and with either Klefbom or Sekera he'll be given the chance to succeed.   The trade aspect I don't think matters as much because the options were to not qualify him or to pay him something like this so if he sucks and they trade him for a 4th round pick I think that'd still be better than walking away from him this summer.
EdmontonOilers,3dejx0,shweet44722,2,Wed Jul 15 18:10:28 2015 UTC,"Well he did play a good amount with Klefbom, which I mean led to tons of minutes but probably did lead to some improved numbers too. He did also have cushy zones starts this season, but with the amount of minutes he played before Nelson started reigning that in it wouldn't really have mattered all that much.  That's true, but I guess for me it ends up a net loss with a gap on the right side...buuut then we'll also have the 3.9M to throw towards someone so there's that too."
EdmontonOilers,3dejx0,haterbehatin,2,Wed Jul 15 18:15:00 2015 UTC,"Yeah he seemed to play a lot better with Klefbom and I think his metrics back up that boost.   I think the problem with him is the visual because when he fucks up it's usually a glorious fuck up.   Yeah I guess they could've walked away from him and pursued another free agent but then you could be stuck with a guy like Franson who may end up being a more expensive Schultz or he could be good, this way is less risky.   I could see if Schultz doesn't improve this year Nurse moving into his spot next year."
EdmontonOilers,3dejx0,shweet44722,2,Wed Jul 15 18:21:27 2015 UTC,"Yeah, and the issue with that is we need Klefbom to play big minutes...which Schultz in his present state cannot handle.  Oh yeah, I think I'd agree with that. Guess he subscribes to the theory that if you're going to fuck up, you might as well do so royally.  That's true. And the other side is it does give time for the draft picks and prospects to develop rather than being forced into the lineup before they're ready."
EdmontonOilers,3dejx0,haterbehatin,2,Wed Jul 15 18:43:41 2015 UTC,"I'm hoping now that they can have a real top 4 not just Klefbom and Schultz he'll improve with less minutes, more powerplay time and less being ridden into the ground in games where they're trailing.  Yeah nothing wrong with Nurse and or Reinhart getting a little time in Bakersfield plus I don't know what next years free agent class looks like but it should also leave some time for other defense to become available in trade."
EdmontonOilers,3dejx0,Loire55,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:56:49 2015 UTC,His defensive downside outweighed his offensive upside. He cost more goals then he accrued last season. Personally I think McLellan can turn that around though.
EdmontonOilers,3dejx0,tsn123456789,2,Wed Jul 15 18:16:54 2015 UTC,"Not saying your wrong but when someone says his offense doesn't make up for his defense, what metric are you using to make this determination?"
EdmontonOilers,3dejx0,Arunatic5,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:47:00 2015 UTC,I agree. Especially since TMac's system heavily relies on offence from D-men.
EdmontonOilers,3dfcsp,InvisibleEnemy,6,Wed Jul 15 20:52:09 2015 UTC,"That's pretty normal process. Last year was a little different with the lack of centre depth and unknowns as far as a defense goes, but this year seems a little more solid. There may be a few guys sticking around after the preseason, but it's unlikely."
EdmontonOilers,3dfcsp,shweet44722,3,Wed Jul 15 21:01:39 2015 UTC,"With McLellan here, I have a feeling they will. I'm sure they want to get the roster set as soon as possible. Their will obviously be a few guys who get cut later, but most of the cuts will be made pretty soon into camp/pre-season I imagine."
EdmontonOilers,3dfcsp,Shottaz83,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:07:22 2015 UTC,It's very rare for any team to be at a final roster through pre-season games. Tend need to final looks for decisions and even then that can creep into the season.  It might be a lot different this year as there seems to be more sure things on what the line up will be. Only a few uncertainties.
EdmontonOilers,3dfcsp,putzeh,2,Thu Jul 16 16:05:15 2015 UTC,"I understand that for sure, it seemed to me they iced a lot of riff raff last year for way too long. I'd just like to see them rotate in some of the more established players near the end of training camp so they can develop some chemistry. Our starts of been abysmal the last few seasons and I like to see them get off to a good start for once."

I mean there are morons everywhere, but I'd imagine the Oilers would be fairly accepting (or so I hope!).  If we're talking acceptance and including race and religion go...I don't know if that matters anymore. I mean I've never had an issue, I've had some nasty things said to me while on and off the field in the states but that was expected, and rare. Have yet to have anyone say anything about me or my parent's religion in the hockey world, so there's that. I think the nice thing about Edmonton is that it's such a hockey based city that if you like hockey, and are on the Oilers and can play, you'll generally be loved by most people in the hockey world."
EdmontonOilers,3dfbzz,shweet44722,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:00:21 2015 UTC,"All good things to know.  And mind if I ask what your religion is, and for more about your experience with it as a fan? I'd be really interested to hear it if you're willing to talk more about it."
EdmontonOilers,3dfbzz,shweet44722,2,Wed Jul 15 21:01:48 2015 UTC,"Well, I mean my views are different than my parents, but I'm half Indian and my Dad's side of the family is very traditional Muslim (Boras). My parents are pretty lax and easygoing about beliefs, but my mother had to convert to Islam in order to marry my father originally. As for me, I prefer to say I'm more of a man of science. I know people who practice, and I went to a Catholic school for a few years since it was the only school that had french in the city (still have the Lord's prayer memorized), but I don't really practice....unless we're in Edmonton with my family. It's nothing major, our family won't really do much other than Eid or the occasional prayer during Ramadan, but we always do Salvat (more or less like saying grace) at big family dinners and I still consider it part of my heritage.  As for part of it being a fan...well I guess it's not really easy to identify per se. I mean I get asked more often if I'm Jewish or Lebanese than anything else, and no one really bothers me about anything. So as a fan...I'm just another Oilers fan. Which I love. It's not often that people can completely ignore who you are and focus on a sole thing that brings people together, which may be part of why I love sports. There's a video that comes to mind of a guy with a very strong Chinese accent leading Man United chants at a crowded bar in Old Trafford. Doesn't matter where you're from, if you love the game and the team, you're part of the group.  I guess I should clarify about the states part...we lived in a very, very conservative part of Colorado near a lot of military bases. So while I wasn't okay with what people said, I kind of understood where it was coming from."

EdmontonOilers,3dfbzz,ProfessorScribbles,2,Wed Jul 15 23:10:05 2015 UTC,"My experience with Oiler fans is probably similar to any sports fans. There are intelligent, open minded and progressive thinking people everywhere. But there are also Ignorant, mean spirited and sometime even homophobic or misogynistic people everywhere. Having said that, i work in the oil Industry in Alberta myself, and i have met a ton of moronic rascist and homophobic redneck Oiler fans. I worked in Calgary for over a year, and there are not even close to as many. Its sad but it has alot to do with the low education level needed to work in the oil and gas industry and it being such a huge factor in central and northern Alberta. It's a little sad, but then again i have met way more Oiler fans that are tons of fun to be around."
EdmontonOilers,3dfbzz,Shottaz83,2,Thu Jul 16 00:43:57 2015 UTC,"I'd heard rumors that there were a lot of ignorant Oilers fans, and this may have been where they got started and it's a shame that people give the team this reputation because of it.

EdmontonOilers,3deqfr,McEirhead,5,Thu Jul 16 14:09:55 2015 UTC,For about half a second I thought you were serious. I think I'm getting paranoid.
EdmontonOilers,3deqfr,shweet44722,7,Wed Jul 15 18:50:22 2015 UTC,"I love the idea of Ference being gone particularly if they still plan on Reinhart making the team but his buyout penalty although not that much the length is still reason for pause to me. It'd be the only option I think makes sense though.  Purcell is a useful player and it makes no sense to buy him out, Nikitin is a far less useful player but with only 1 year left I think it makes more sense to retain salary or bury him in Bakersfield if need be.   edit- I forgot to say that I think a Nikitin buyout could make sense but only if it's to make cap room for a deal they want to make immediately either a trade or free agent signing otherwise it's not worth his penalty."
EdmontonOilers,3deqfr,haterbehatin,0,Wed Jul 15 18:27:18 2015 UTC,"Purcell is in their because of his cap hit. He gets way too much for how much he contributes. I like him as well, but not for that price.  Like I said, Ference would make the most sense. The buyout penalty is just over 1M a year, and it would only go for 2 years after his actual contract is over, which isn't all that bad. His 3.25M cap hit is whats bad, especially for 2 more years.  Edit: Also like you said, Niktin would only cost 1.5M for the next 2 years if we bought him out, thats really not that bad. Especially considering it would free up a roster spot, which is more improtant than the cap space right now."
EdmontonOilers,3deqfr,haterbehatin,4,Wed Jul 15 18:32:38 2015 UTC,I think he's a bit overpaid but if you buy him out you have to replace him and the guy has to be either better at 3 million a year or make less than 3 million for it to make sense.   I think if he was going to go he's another one that a trade with salary retention if necessary makes more sense than having 1.5 million in dead cap next year.   I do agree though Ference is the best option for a buyout not so much because of his cap hit but for his spot on the roster.
EdmontonOilers,3deqfr,haterbehatin,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:47:13 2015 UTC,"We have young guys coming up that could easily replace him. Nurse and Reinhart for instance. I'd much rather have them on the ice, however inexperienced they are, than a guy who is only getting worse. Give the young guys a chance."
EdmontonOilers,3deqfr,DocDiggler,2,Wed Jul 15 19:01:25 2015 UTC,That's what I'm thinking too if Ference is gone it gives Reinhart or Nurse a chance to fight for a spot in camp as well as guys like Oesterle and Davidson.   If they're not ready Nikitin and Gryba isin't the most ideal bottom pairing but I would argue it's about as good as Ference and Gryba.
EdmontonOilers,3deqfr,Slippy1st,3,Wed Jul 15 19:50:48 2015 UTC,Would it make more sense if Oduya was still available? Right now it just seems like a waste to buy someone out to carry over some contract dollars into next year (I'm thinking Nikitin).  Unless we're actually interested in Erhoff? We don't have any use for the cap space at this point in time and we got 9 mil clearing up next season anyways.
EdmontonOilers,3deqfr,tsn123456789,3,Wed Jul 15 18:36:51 2015 UTC,"We have a lot of room coming up, but I think this is more about roster spots than anything."
EdmontonOilers,3deqfr,tsn123456789,3,Wed Jul 15 19:00:15 2015 UTC,"I think the question is, what would be the motivation to buy someone out? We aren't up against the cap so we may as well keep them until it's a necessity."
EdmontonOilers,3deqfr,jordanrhys,2,Wed Jul 15 18:44:36 2015 UTC,Freeing up roster spots is the motivation. At least thats what I think.
EdmontonOilers,3deqfr,Slippy1st,3,Wed Jul 15 18:59:23 2015 UTC,We can just send Nikitin to the AHL

EdmontonOilers,3ddu2y,envague,7,Wed Jul 15 16:50:24 2015 UTC,"It's a tough call. If we start retiring numbers that aren't in the HHOF, where do we draw the line? Will Hall switch numbers so that Lowe's #4 can be retired? Do we retire Smyth's #94 despite him never winning anything with the Oilers? If we retire #94 we have to retire Weight's #39, right?   Hamilton's number in the rafters is the only real reminder we have of the WHA days. I don't mind him being a special case."

EdmontonOilers,3dc9h6,haterbehatin,-3,Wed Jul 15 05:31:23 2015 UTC,I don't think we've witnessed the same transactions. He's made two quality free agent signings and several questionable trades in my opinion.
EdmontonOilers,3dc9h6,Icekommander,1 point,Wed Jul 15 05:40:42 2015 UTC,Several questionable trades? Which ones?
EdmontonOilers,3dc9h6,maasd,8,Wed Jul 15 05:44:53 2015 UTC,"I'm not /u/haterbehatin, but the Gordon and Reinhart trades are the two that come to my mind as pretty questionable -- I'm willing to suspend judgement for now, but I don't feel very optimistic about them. The Marincin for Gryba exchange I'd just call bad."
EdmontonOilers,3dc9h6,papercutpete,3,Wed Jul 15 07:35:24 2015 UTC,"I didn't feel the Gordon trade was bad AFTER we signed Letestu and had a serviceable LW in Korpikoski which must have been their plan, given Gordon was traded the night before free agency."
EdmontonOilers,3dc9h6,haterbehatin,5,Wed Jul 15 18:20:45 2015 UTC,I wouldnt
EdmontonOilers,3dc9h6,falsekoala,2,Wed Jul 15 14:07:40 2015 UTC,"16th overall plus 33rd overall for Griffin Reinhart, Marincin for 107th overall and Brad Ross, 107th overall for Eric Gryba and Gordon for Korpikoski.   The Reinhart one he could look good if Reinhart turns into a 2/3 defenseman but thats a fairly lofty target. Otherwise he paid too big of a price after missing out on Hamilton.   Trading Marincin could've made sense given the abundance of bottom pairing defensemen on the Oilers and him being waiver eligible but doing so to bring in yet another bottom pairing defenseman wipes out the entire rationale for such a move.   Gordon it makes sense to deal him if you're bringing in Letestu as they were but getting someone like Korpikoski in return who wasn't good for Arizona last year and has 2 years left at a 2.5 million cap hit is questionable.   The only trade he's made so far that you can immediately say it was a good move was the Talbot trade the rest were all questionable."
EdmontonOilers,3dc9h6,Loire55,8,Wed Jul 15 05:55:20 2015 UTC,"The Reinhart one he could look good if Reinhart turns into a 2/3 defenseman but thats a fairly lofty target. Otherwise he paid too big of a price after missing out on Hamilton.   Since when is the Hamilton trade the benchmark for the price it takes to get defencemen? I guarantee you that if the Flames hadn't pulled that move and picked up Hamilton for peanuts, we wouldn't be here discussing this issue. Did we pay too much for Reinhart? Honest answer is I don't know. Why? Because he hasn't even played a game for us yet! I mean for a group of fans who preach about not rushing to judge players, this is some seriously hypocritical shit. I mean the guy is 21 years old and has the potential to be a real leader in this team and we're here discussing how Chia blew the picks to get him when not him, nor anyone from the picks has proven squat for you to jump that conclusion.    Trading Marincin could've made sense given the abundance of bottom pairing defensemen on the Oilers and him being waiver eligible but doing so to bring in yet another bottom pairing defenseman wipes out the entire rationale for such a move.   Marincin was going no where. He only ever had half a good season for us and after that regressed so badly that he was getting benched at OKC. He had a work-ethic problem and wasn't taking good care of himself either. What we got for Marincin was less than ideal, but we replaced him with Gryba, who has a solid 3-5 years in him at the top level. Its not the worst thing in the world, especially since Marincin was never going to be much better than Gryba. We gave up a potentially 4/5 guy for a solid 5/6 guy. So I have no qualms about that.   and Gordon for Korpikoski.   I have no idea how you think this is a questionable trade. It was a clear win in my book. We replaced Gordon with Korpi + Letestu.   but getting someone like Korpikoski in return who wasn't good for Arizona last year   lol, are you seriously going to judge players from a team that was trying to tank last season? I mean come on.."
EdmontonOilers,3dc9h6,falsekoala,8,Wed Jul 15 06:48:41 2015 UTC,"Marincin was soft as baby poop.  And there's no guarantee that we would've picked at 16 would've panned out.  Letestu is younger and better than Gordon at a lower price. Korpikoski, while a 2.5 cap hit, isn't bad. He'll benefit from a new market.   Gryba will be fine.   My big thing is that we didn't lose many assets. Marincin and Gordon.   Chiarelli has done fine."
EdmontonOilers,3dc9h6,Loire55,3,Wed Jul 15 07:31:59 2015 UTC,It will never cease to amaze me how the fans of a sports franchise will talk up a player one day then put him on blast the second he's traded.

EdmontonOilers,3dc9h6,Arunatic5,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:54:10 2015 UTC,"He wasn't an eyeball player, he was a statistical. But if you had to eyeball him watch how he keeps shots to the outside. He doesn't hit anyone, that's for sure, but he adeptly kept plays to the outside. Second, you had to watch his stick work. He was exceptionally good at breaking up or blocking passing plays.  But yes he never hit, looked soft, had a big long stride so he looked slow and couldn't score to save his life. His eye test game wasn't great."
EdmontonOilers,3dc9h6,Arunatic5,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:07:23 2015 UTC,"I'm not an advanced stat guy, so that's probably where I form my opinion."
EdmontonOilers,3dc9h6,MaxxLolz,2,Wed Jul 15 17:24:41 2015 UTC,"Marincin is soft as baby poop.   What the actual fuck? Is this the only measure of defensive abilities - how physical you are? Marincin's strength from the very beginning was always his puck possession ability. Considering he didn't contribute that much to offence, his impact was shot suppression a.k.a. the opponent did not shot as often if Marincin was on the ice. He had capacity to be top 4 (and was in his rookie season), but he had a bad sophomore campaign (exceeding common in the NHL). So in short, we traded a player with capacity to be a top 4 D in the league to a team that will coach him to that ability and beyond, while getting a top 6/7 D, of which we already had plenty. We lost this trade badly. This is fact."
EdmontonOilers,3dc9h6,papercutpete,2,Wed Jul 15 13:28:28 2015 UTC,"There is a difference between the sophomore slump and regression. When you play well enough to still be playing at the NHL level but don't produce the same type of performances from the previous season, that's the sophomore slump. When you go from being a top 4 defenceman for half a season to not even making the line-up for an AHL team, that's called regression. Also, don't forget that Gryba is still only 27, so only just hitting his prime. We did not lose this trade badly, and that'll only be evident once the season starts. Plus, I can confidently say that he won't ever be a top 4 D-man for a team aspiring to win the SC."
EdmontonOilers,3dc9h6,oddspellingofPhreid,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:44:22 2015 UTC,"Problem was Marincin was traded at the value when he was scratched, not including his potential. When you trade in the offseason, the value of players should include both components. Problem was in Chia's trade assessment he traded only on the basis of current player stock. When trades like these are being proposed, the trading team proposes the players potential stock, and the receiving team downvalues it with the most current stock. Whatever Yak deals were on the table in past years fell through because teams would refuse to acknowledge Yak's potential stock. The difference in Marincin's case was Toronto assessed Marincin's stock as a 4th round pick and a DHL player, and Chia said OK. At the very least Marincin is worth a 3rd round pick + extra based on his potential stock, but not the value that he fetched. Hence, we lost that trade.  Also,   Plus, I can confidently say that he won't ever be a top 4 D-man for a team aspiring to win the SC.   That's a bold statement to say about a 23 year old. Last time tall Slovakian defender got assessed poorly by his own GM, he went on to put up 13 seasons of great play (first few seasons of which he was still on considered a tall defender), and will likely be a HoF. If you're wondering that player was Chara and he was 24 when he was traded to the Sens from NYI."
EdmontonOilers,3dc9h6,papercutpete,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:08:51 2015 UTC,"I understand all of that, but its also important to look at the bigger picture. If you begin to overanalyze every part of every trade, you're never going to be in a position to build a team. And really, that's what we need to look at. Its not like dealing Marincin for a 4th rounder and a contract dump was a colossal mistake. He knew he wanted a gritty 3rd liner who could support the younger guys and thats what he got in exchange for Marincin in my view. If you say he lost the Marincin trade, I can say he won the Gryba trade, because we traded away a nothing prospect plus a 4th round pick for a RHD who will be an excellent third pairing D-man for years to come... Or he might get flipped for someone better at the trade deadline.  Problem with Marincin's trade value was, as you say, that nobody wanted him for the price we wanted to trade him for. Considering the fact that we picked up Reinhart, odds were Marincin would start next season in the AHL if we had decided to keep him. Teams knew that too, which further lowered his value. So, when considering two situations (leaving out performance based considerations):   We have too many left-handed D-men prospect We would essentially have Reinhart, Nurse & Marincin competing for that 3rd line role   Chia was pretty much forced to trade him. Now you could argue that maybe he could've included Marincin in a trade for someone like Seabrook, but the draft day is one of the days where teams are most likely to cave in and deal. What I'm trying to say is, its hard to move pieces effectively on days that aren't Trade Deadline or Draft Day. Given these facts, I think Chia did well to get what he did for Marincin and flipping those assets to get Gryba.   As for Marincin's potential.. I don't think there would be too many Oiler fans who would be confident enough to tell me with 100% certainty that he is going to be better than Gryba, especially considering the fact that he'd have to fight for that 3rd line spot with Nurse and Reinhart. If getting demoted to the AHL from camp is enough to crush his confidence, I mean more competition isn't something I think he would be able to cope well with. And mind you, Gryba is only 27, so only 4 years older than Marincin.   If you consider the fact that Marincin will most likely start the season with the Marlies again (unless Leafs are in tank mode again), it will take him about 2 more seasons till he is in the position that Klefbom is in right now, i.e. 100% certain to start in the NHL (so by the time he is about 25), I really don't believe he will be a top 4 D-man. I could be wrong, but there is a plethora of LHD in the NHL, and the Leafs could give up on him at any time. And don't forget that the chances of a 3rd rounder working out and fulfilling his potential is less than 30%.  What I'm trying to say is, there are just too many 'ifs' about him, while in Gryba we're getting a very very good 3rd line D-man with some play-off experience who is capable of playing a ton of minutes for us for several more years."

Other defensemen arguably passed him on the depth chart, plus we might want to find places in our line-up for other young defensemen. He was expendable, and it was his own fault."
EdmontonOilers,3dc9h6,Loire55,2,Wed Jul 15 14:12:51 2015 UTC,Dallas Eakins said Marincin was out of shape. Considering how this sub decided Eakins is the devil I find it odd you are trusting his perception of Marincin.
EdmontonOilers,3dc9h6,Vlykeron,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:44:04 2015 UTC,In that case should we suspend judgement on Nikitin? Because it was said he was out of shape at his arrival to camp as well.
EdmontonOilers,3dc9h6,LuckyCanuck13,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:53:07 2015 UTC,"I'd call Reinhart risky, but questionable isn't an incorrect way to put it. In a vacuum the talent at 16 and 33 is probably superior to that of Reinhart, but if Reinhart can fix his skating he'd be at least a solid No. 3 guy which would help us tremendously than the two (likely) skill forwards would make. If Reinhart can't fix his skating then it's a bad deal. I don't agree that Hamilton is a good comparison though, since Sweeney went full retard there.  Gryba for Marincin is bad IMO. I know Marincin is soft and regressed this year but his upside is higher than Gryba's, who really should be a 7D on most teams. Marincin showed some promise the year before and he just turned 23, we all know D man takes long to develop and yet after one bad year we threw him away for a 4th rounder.  Gordon for Korpikoski made no sense to me. Unless there's absolutely no one willing to take Gordon into cap space, we only saved 500k in cap this year and lose 2.5M in cap next year. I would have rather retained salary and get greater flexibility this year and next year, given that we are a surplus of bottom 6 guys anyways. I'd be surprised if no one takes Gordon for a mid-round pick with 1.5M retained. Chia is basically banking on a Korpi returning to 3 years in the past. Obviously you can't say it's impossible for him to have a bounce back year, but it's a gamble and if it fails we lose cap flexibility for next year. Given his performance the past 3 years, Korpi is nowhere near as impactful as Gordon, so Chia in my mind overpaid in that trade. I would prefer having 2.5M of cap space that I can do anything with than a Korpi who really isn't a rare commodity."
EdmontonOilers,3dc9h6,Shawing85,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:51:44 2015 UTC,"but his upside is higher than Gryba's, who really should be a 7D on most teams.   Gryba isn't a 7D on most teams. He had 57 appearances in 2013/14 - which was only his 2nd season in the NHL - and 75 this season with 6 play-off games. 7Ds don't make that many appearances.   I also disagree that his upside is higher than Gryba's. He is a better possession player than Gryba, yes, but there was absolutely no room for him to fit in and grow here next season as a LHD. Chia was pretty much had to deal him after that Reinhart trade, and tbh, I'd have Reinhart over Marincin in my team.   Marincin showed some promise the year before and he just turned 23, we all know D man takes long to develop and yet after one bad year we threw him away for a 4th rounder.   I don't think people here realize just how much he had regressed. He wasn't working for a spot on the team at all. From everyone that I've spoken to who watched him on a regular basis for OKC have said he was no where near the level at which he played last season. He did not work on his conditioning, as he was asked to do, for a second consecutive season. And I personally do not like players who aren't willing to take their career seriously.   Unless there's absolutely no one willing to take Gordon into cap space, we only saved 500k in cap this year and lose 2.5M in cap next year.   We traded a 4th line C with a $3m cap hit to a 3rd line LW (an area which needed reinforcing) with a $2.5m cap hit. I don't see what's so criminal about that. If anything, we now have 2 players instead of 1 with just $1m extra in cap hit. And I think Korpi will end up surprising a lot of people here.   Obviously you can't say it's impossible for him to have a bounce back year, but it's a gamble and if it fails we lose cap flexibility for next year. Given his performance the past 3 years, Korpi is nowhere near as impactful as Gordon, so Chia in my mind overpaid in that trade.   And if he does have a bounce-back year and gets 30 points, do you think he'd be worth the $2.5m in cap hit?"
EdmontonOilers,3dc9h6,oddspellingofPhreid,3,Wed Jul 15 18:44:49 2015 UTC,I can see why it could be Yak compared to the other Top 6 players but I'd freaking kill to keep Nail on the team.  I'm thinking maybe dumping Purcell for someone who is more of the typical 3rd liner (though I do love that he can step in in case of injury) or a Scrivens move.

Wholly shit Edmonton, that downtown is going to be amazing in a couple years.  Really great for the city and the province.  I wouldn't get too caught on that trade talk because he barely said anything about it.  I hope you guys listen to that interview, if you can, just to see hear what's in store for that Ice District.  As a guy from Saskatchewan my ears definitely perked up and my first thought is that I need to make a bigger effort to go visit Edmonton.  Those that live there should be really happy about this."

EdmontonOilers,3dc9h6,IGetComputersPuting,3,Wed Jul 15 03:38:00 2015 UTC,McDavid for David Clarkson confirmed. This lineup needs more veteran grit.
EdmontonOilers,3dc9h6,supertroll1999,3,Wed Jul 15 09:28:56 2015 UTC,I'd think you see a 500 million dollar arena get torn down in a night.

EdmontonOilers,3dc9h6,falsekoala,2,Wed Jul 15 07:13:39 2015 UTC,"Why is everyone saying ""Please not be Yak!"" if it's a trade? Who else would we trade that you'd rather get rid of? You have to give up quality to get quality. We're not going to get a top pairing defenseman by shipping away Purcell, Nikitin, and a 1st round pick. I think we get a top flight defenseman, we need to give up Yakupov or Eberle - and I'm fine with that if it actually fills a need long term."
EdmontonOilers,3dcnbw,trippymane9,15,Wed Jul 15 05:52:14 2015 UTC,I'm tired of this fan base feeling like a teenage boy who needs constant validation that his new girlfriend actually likes him.  I wonder when that will stop.

EdmontonOilers,3dcnbw,falsekoala,8,Wed Jul 15 07:45:25 2015 UTC,"I was more making a joke. If you want my serious answer, I see this more as mental masturbation than approval seeking. It's not like if he didn't do this specific interview, or the one before, we would think he wasn't proud. It's the offseason. Content, especially team specific content, is limited. Tiny news becomes big news. When I see interviews with McDavid, I don't go ""SEE! He likes us!"" I go ""man, I can't wait to watch him play."""

Gotta love his attitude though he doesnt put on no front and hes just a chill guy and doesnt feel any need to play into any hype or anything you can tell and doesnt seem to be bothered by the pressure or anything and is just taking everything in stride. sooo ya mcjesus is awesome and i think they gonna have a great time as a team"

EdmontonOilers,3db6ab,kodefoo,19,Tue Jul 14 22:29:54 2015 UTC,"Welcome to oil country. We have one of the most storied histories in the NHL with 5 Stanley cups. 4 were led by the greatest player of all time Wayne Gretzky, as well as other great players Mark Messier, Paul Coffee, and Grant Fuhr in the 80's. Arguably the most dominant team of all time played in this era of the Oilers. However ownership had money problems and sold Wayne Gretzky to the LA Kings which led to the dissembling of the dynasty.   In the 90's and early 2000's money was tight which led to a hockey style that was distinctly Edmonton Oilers. A rag tag group of hard working Oilers consistently over achieved to make it in the playoffs which then they got beat by the very powerful Dallas stars in the first round. In 2006 on the back of defenceman Chris Pronger and Dwanye Roloson goaltending led the to the Stanley cup finals. Roloson got hurt and the Oilers lost in game 7 and have not been to the finals since.  After this a dark time of mismanagement began. Plagued by injuries, bad free agent signings. Trading solid NHL players for poor return has caused the worst record in the NHL over the last 10 years. The Oilers had to rebuild twice, once with gagner, cogliano, Gilbert, and nillson. Who were all traded away and a full blown rebuild began. Now we have 4 first overall draft picks, Taylor Hall a speedy goal scoring winger, Ryan Nugent-Hopkins a great passing and also defensively responsible center, Nail Yakupov a goal scoring winger who has been scruntized for not playing up to potential, and most recently Connor McDavid an extremely highly touted Center who has been named to be the next generational player.  We have an owner who is willing to spend to get a winning team. A new building in our downtown core to open in a year. A new GM who has won a Stanley cup. A president who was Hockey Canada's president for a long time. A new veteran coach who has had significant success with the San Jose Sharks. And a great pool of young prospects. The Oilers have come a long way from a very small town to having a team of the best players ever, then going to finicial difficulty, and finally a terrible decade of mismanagement. There are so many story's of pain and joy with the Oilers, I would love to answer any specific questions if you have any."
EdmontonOilers,3db6ab,TylrP,6,Wed Jul 15 02:11:18 2015 UTC,"Wow sorry for going on a rant I just got excited... Edmonton was just another small hard working city until the Oilers came into town, and then they joined the NHL and became known in north america. Then the Oilers started winning Cups and Gretzky put us on a stage. The fans have been through hell the past 10 years but we sell out every night regardless."

A few videos of recent Oilers History  Taylor Hall: Fastest 2 goals in Oilers history  Sam Gagner: 8 Point game  Ben Scrivens: 59 save shutout  can't think of any others, but there are more from the last 5 or 6 seasons.

EdmontonOilers,3dacka,envague,5,Tue Jul 14 19:12:24 2015 UTC,If you can't tape your stick orange....I don't think you can make your pads the pattern of the net.
EdmontonOilers,3dacka,WorkThrowaway91,2,Tue Jul 14 19:16:30 2015 UTC,"i remember seeing a video of some kid a few years back who made his own gear with netting over the white pads. there seemed to be scientific evidence to back up the idea too. players only taking a quick look to see where to shoot were more likely to shoot into his pads, thinking it was open net."
EdmontonOilers,3dacka,Girthworthy,3,Tue Jul 14 20:56:36 2015 UTC,"Not sure about ""official-ness"" but the reason so many pads have white as a base colour, especially on the inside angle, is to make the five hole appear bigger than it is."
EdmontonOilers,3dacka,HarfNarfArf,2,Tue Jul 14 19:20:02 2015 UTC,I think there's merit to it.  I recall several years ago it was determined that Fleury's yellow pads led to a slight increase to his GAA because it was easier for shooters to spot them quickly.

For those interested, here's a link to the stadium cam for the New Mosaic Stadium. Comin' along! It'll technically be ready around this time next year, but the Riders won't play their first game there until June 2017. They want to avoid a Winnipeg/Hamilton type of situation. This webcam is mounted on top of the ""old"" Mosaic Stadium."

Herbers was absolute gold at the U of A and is probably one of the biggest reasons why the Men's team is one of the best in the CIS, especially with the back to back championships.   I had a buddy who played under Herbers and had nothing but great things to say. Excellent hire for the Oilers, a big blow to the Golden Bears."
EdmontonOilers,3d6sky,WildcardKH,3,Tue Jul 14 00:10:05 2015 UTC,"As a Bears fan, Shit! As an Oilers fan, Yay!"
EdmontonOilers,3d6sky,Berding,6,Tue Jul 14 04:54:52 2015 UTC,Apparently Herbers was also close to being named head coach of the Kelowna Rockets until he decided to accept McLellan's offer. He also just recently won the past two CIS championships with the Golden Bears (who are also in need of a new coach).  *E: There were minor rumblings that Pisani was looking for the assistant position with the Oilers. He was on Herbers staff last season - maybe he takes over?
EdmontonOilers,3d6sky,shweet44722,3,Mon Jul 13 23:42:37 2015 UTC,"I could see Pisani taking over at U of A, and it'd be pretty cool to see. I'd definitely watch him coach U of A vs. Carleton...so long as the Golden Bears lose."
EdmontonOilers,3d6sky,Shottaz83,11,Tue Jul 14 00:47:15 2015 UTC,"I really like the hire. Has a very good track record at the U of A, and if T-Mac feels like he's a good hire, then he probably is. It still feels weird trusting your management/coaching/president. Nicholson has done an incredible job this past year. Praise be to you Bob Nicholson."
EdmontonOilers,3d6sky,HarfNarfArf,2,Mon Jul 13 23:56:36 2015 UTC,"Interesting. Don't know much about him, but having somebody who was not a TMac boy could be a good thing, assuming this counts entirely as an outside hire.   Edit: Former Oiler, but I don't see this as an OBC type of hire."

EdmontonOilers,3d6sky,RedOilSaints,1 point,Mon Jul 13 23:40:48 2015 UTC,"Great hire. He made the Golden Bears into a powerhouse. IIRC, he also was in Nashville's system before coming to the UofA, and they were disappointed in losing him.   We're building a really nice coaching staff of guys who can help develop players mixed in with getting the most out of them."
EdmontonOilers,3d68b0,Shottaz83,12,Mon Jul 13 21:08:14 2015 UTC,"That's one thing Nuge has always been credited for though, it's not like people underrate him, they underrate his shot as they kind of expect him to pass more often than not. But when he rips it, he can rip it.   I'm more impressed by the elite level finish by Hall, the speed which that comes of his stick in a split second is the real thing of beauty to me in the video."
EdmontonOilers,3d68b0,Frostdavid,10,Mon Jul 13 21:14:44 2015 UTC,My favourite Nuge moment: when he walked Nick Lidstrom as a rookie.
EdmontonOilers,3d68b0,HarfNarfArf,5,Mon Jul 13 23:40:07 2015 UTC,Yea thats my favorite highlight of him. Schooling one of the best Defenders of all time and then setting up a great scoring opportunity as well.
EdmontonOilers,3d68b0,HarfNarfArf,2,Mon Jul 13 23:43:55 2015 UTC,"I'm also looking for one from this year. Against Philly I believe. He picked a clearing pass out of mid air, quick pass to (Hall?) and a goal. So nice. Great awareness by Nuge."
EdmontonOilers,3d68b0,notsoyoungpadawan,4,Mon Jul 13 23:45:25 2015 UTC,Credit to Pitlick there too for getting his foot out of the way.
EdmontonOilers,3d68b0,imnotswedishreally,5,Mon Jul 13 22:45:29 2015 UTC,"If Leon makes the Oilers this year (probable), then we'll have 2 other guys who can pass as well as RNH.   Think about the duos:  Hall-McDavid (offensive hilarity)  Pou-RNH (big dude with a good passer)  Leon-Yak (IDK but if McLellan doesn't misuse Yak then we could be an offensive juggernaut)   (These are Lowetide duos)  Throw in the other pieces like Ebs and Lander...   Goddamn"
EdmontonOilers,3d68b0,Loire55,15,Mon Jul 13 21:15:48 2015 UTC,"I'm usually on the Lowetide train but we need to stop fucking around with Yak. Hall can play next to anyone, Yak needs McD until he he pulls his game together."
EdmontonOilers,3d68b0,shittybillz,10,Mon Jul 13 21:54:00 2015 UTC,"Yea. Second line of yak, Mcdavid and hall. More like a line 1b instead of line 2."
EdmontonOilers,3d68b0,Malarkeyhogwash,3,Mon Jul 13 23:12:19 2015 UTC,"Exactly keep Pou Nuge and ebs together, they did well last year. I sincerely hope these are our opening two lines at the start of the season, and if it needs a shakeup, so be it. Yak Hall and CSP would be a speed show."
EdmontonOilers,3d68b0,TheMildTroll,3,Tue Jul 14 03:29:55 2015 UTC,I find it pretty funny that we could potentially have a 2nd line made of only 1st overall draft picks.
EdmontonOilers,3d60tm,shweet44722,21,Mon Jul 13 20:15:25 2015 UTC,"Not sure how I feel about the new name.

EdmontonOilers,3d60tm,8Milesofshade,14,Mon Jul 13 20:18:23 2015 UTC,"The name itself is definitely kind of corny, but the fact that the city is forcing a name on the district is even cornier. It's like a kid trying to give himself a nickname. Let the people come up with their own name for the district over time, that's how it's supposed to happen.

The ""c"" in McDavid is a bit small on the home blue, but I ordered an orange one where the problem seems to be fixed. All in all, good budget buy. But that's just my experience."
EdmontonOilers,3d2ii5,Swank_Magazine,3,Tue Jul 14 07:56:07 2015 UTC,If you're happy with it that's great.  For anyone else using this as a comparable to a real jersey.. it's not even close.
EdmontonOilers,3d2ii5,b0r0n,7,Mon Jul 13 02:17:21 2015 UTC,I never compared it he asked for a cheap jersey and I said if he doesn't care if it's fake
EdmontonOilers,3d2ii5,Jeffw54,2,Mon Jul 13 02:24:00 2015 UTC,Checked your post history to see the jersey. Even for a fake that looks like shit.
EdmontonOilers,3d2ii5,Wurdfurd,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:55:01 2015 UTC,Really how so? Every where else I posted I got pretty good comments
EdmontonOilers,3d2ii5,Jeffw54,0,Mon Jul 13 21:03:54 2015 UTC,He said cheap but quality. The one on aliexpress right now looks like a grade schooler drew the logo. I love quality fakes but that one is embarrassing
EdmontonOilers,3d2ii5,ribozyme90,0,Tue Jul 14 05:09:26 2015 UTC,Well maybe you can check out mine cause seems like everyone liked it and I could give a shit what you think about it cause I payed 30 bucks
EdmontonOilers,3d2ii5,Jeffw54,0,Tue Jul 14 13:38:40 2015 UTC,Haha! I saw it! The logos and numbers are fucking wrinkled! Get real man. Return it and get a better quality fake  And for $30 you got ripped off. There are jerseys there for $30 that have great logos and numbers
EdmontonOilers,3d2ii5,ribozyme90,0,Tue Jul 14 15:49:53 2015 UTC,"Sure man I will take some idiots opinion online and send it back to that Chinese site, I'm just saying if the guy wants to buy one I never asked your opinion"
EdmontonOilers,3d2ii5,Jeffw54,0,Tue Jul 14 16:23:05 2015 UTC,Lol you told me to check out your pretty jersey and I did. Looks like shit. I'm trying to save you the embarrassment of wearing that rag in public
EdmontonOilers,3d2ii5,ribozyme90,-1,Tue Jul 14 17:17:51 2015 UTC,Thanks but I never asked for your help and I live in Nova Scotia so I don't think there will be many dicks like you picking me out of the street and saying it's fake
EdmontonOilers,3d2ii5,Jeffw54,0,Tue Jul 14 17:20:58 2015 UTC,"Thank god! And again, the issue is not that its fake, the issue is that the logo is misshapen and wrinkled"
EdmontonOilers,3d2ii5,ribozyme90,0,Tue Jul 14 17:46:02 2015 UTC,you are an idiot
EdmontonOilers,3d2ii5,Jeffw54,0,Tue Jul 14 17:47:03 2015 UTC,With a good lookin jersey ;)
EdmontonOilers,3d2ii5,ribozyme90,3,Tue Jul 14 17:51:22 2015 UTC,Saw em at jersey city in WEM for $99
EdmontonOilers,3d2ii5,WickaWhat,4,Mon Jul 13 01:22:06 2015 UTC,Gonna go ahead and call BS on that since Jersey City is affiliated with Game On (Official Oilers retailer)
EdmontonOilers,3d2ii5,Wurdfurd,2,Mon Jul 13 12:10:45 2015 UTC,Thats the price tag that was on the jersey.
EdmontonOilers,3d2ii5,WickaWhat,5,Mon Jul 13 12:46:16 2015 UTC,Jersey city tags the name and number separately than the jersey. There's a 134.99 tag for the jersey and 99.99 for the name and number because another company does their lettering for them
EdmontonOilers,3d2ii5,olgoods,3,Mon Jul 13 15:15:51 2015 UTC,Thanks for the clarification. That price seemed too good.
EdmontonOilers,3d2ii5,WickaWhat,2,Mon Jul 13 15:44:49 2015 UTC,"You get what you pay for.  If you buy a cheap jersey, you'll get a cheap jersey.  Keep an eye out for sales.

All those cups don't lie!   I also loved his retirement ceremony. Seeing the spotlight on the net, with Fuhr in his gear and stance, was just awesome.  Looking forward to the next one!"
EdmontonOilers,3cxloh,tvberkel,8,Sat Jul 11 21:30:51 2015 UTC,"Bonus anecdote: I’m too young to have seen Fuhr play in his prime, and I never played ice hockey, but Fuhr inspired me to play goal in my middle school ball hockey league. I must have read his book a dozen times. Reading about the mindset and process of one of the all-time greats (even if it’s absurdly out of date) was fascinating to me. If you can get your hands on a copy, it’s definitely worth a read."

EdmontonOilers,3cxgch,KidsAndTheHall,19,Sat Jul 11 17:19:24 2015 UTC,"I really like the current blue and orange home jersey. They stand out a lot more than the old copper and blue ones. I also really like the McFarlane alternate - it was great seeing a different style on the logo and I thought that one was really cool. I wouldn't want it as our logo, but I thought it made an amazing third."
EdmontonOilers,3cxgch,Sidetrakkd,1 point,Sat Jul 11 17:40:54 2015 UTC,What were the McFarlane jerseys?
EdmontonOilers,3cxgch,firesofpompeii,5,Sun Jul 12 04:57:45 2015 UTC,These ones.
EdmontonOilers,3cxgch,AtomicMeltdown0,12,Sun Jul 12 05:19:37 2015 UTC,"I dunno, I kind of like them all in varying degrees, except for those stupid minimalistic pajama jerseys they switched to when converting to reebok.  When they first introduced the McFarlane jerseys, I wasn't a huge fan, but now I really miss em. I think that logo is pretty tight and they should consider bringing it back. I would ignore the symbolism and not fudge with it too much."
EdmontonOilers,3cxgch,McEirhead,5,Sat Jul 11 17:30:42 2015 UTC,"I think the whole ""3D overdesigned stylistic logos"" have really gone out in sports. I am definitely a fan of the retro/minimal era we are in. There were a lot of tacky logos and brands in sports during the 90's/early 00's."
EdmontonOilers,3cxgch,Panencephalitis,1 point,Sat Jul 11 19:15:48 2015 UTC,"I didn't mind them, but wasn't a huge fan of them, until somebody posted a revamped version here a few months back, it used white as a secondary colour to greater benefit and it looked far more crisp because of that, a little less muddy. I'll try to find it because it didn't look hugely different but really made me like the jersey more."
EdmontonOilers,3cxgch,HarfNarfArf,7,Sun Jul 12 16:34:45 2015 UTC,"I grew up in the Copper and Midnight Blue era too and although those jersey's hold a place in my heart, I feel the Orange and Blue will always be the Oilers ""proper"" colours.   I do miss the McFarlane logo though."
EdmontonOilers,3cxgch,Loire55,4,Sat Jul 11 17:41:12 2015 UTC,"In a couple more years, the copper and blue will be vintage, so then i can rock my Jason Smith jersey again. Fired up about that"
EdmontonOilers,3cxgch,anderhyo,2,Sat Jul 11 17:54:06 2015 UTC,I actually really like our new orange jerseys. They're different and just a bit edgy. I've grown to love the numbers on the shoulders too. Can't wait until I can get mine.
EdmontonOilers,3cxgch,firesofpompeii,2,Sun Jul 12 04:59:17 2015 UTC,"Copper and blue. I like the current blue and orange, but I'm not old enough to remember the last Cup, and the current team hasn't been very successful, so my favourite memories are with the copper and blue."

EdmontonOilers,3cxgch,VanPerstrings,4,Mon Jul 13 05:04:14 2015 UTC,I love the copper and blue too! I kinda miss them
EdmontonOilers,3cxgch,Floklo,2,Sat Jul 11 17:39:22 2015 UTC,I actually like these a lot. However they were used during some of our worst seasons ever.  I definitely enjoyed the blue/orange we have had the last couple seasons but despise the inverse we debuted at the draft that's mostly orange.
EdmontonOilers,3cxgch,Panencephalitis,3,Sat Jul 11 19:20:09 2015 UTC,"It's not an inverse jersey dude, it's a full on retro jersey. Those orange jerseys are a throwback to the WHA Oilers. We had those jerseys before we joined the NHL. I absolutely love that we're bringing them back and can't wait to get one!"
EdmontonOilers,3cxgch,YAK_ATTACK_CALL_911,1 point,Sun Jul 12 09:11:53 2015 UTC,Oh nice! TIL. I still don't like them that much but it's good to know there's a history to the design.
EdmontonOilers,3cxgch,Panencephalitis,1 point,Mon Jul 13 18:17:12 2015 UTC,The away version of that jersey is my favourite one.
EdmontonOilers,3cxgch,mpaw975,2,Sat Jul 11 19:30:55 2015 UTC,Fair enough. I'm never a fan of white jersey's of any hockey team as basically every team in the league has one. It's just boring.
EdmontonOilers,3cxgch,Panencephalitis,1 point,Sat Jul 11 19:40:06 2015 UTC,"Is there any rules stating that the away jersey has to be white? The Blue Bombers, as much as I hate them, have gold away jerseys instead of white so I've always kind of liked that about them, as sacrilege as that sounds coming from a Saskatchewanite."
EdmontonOilers,3cxgch,Tyaust,1 point,Sun Jul 12 06:41:30 2015 UTC,I don't think so no. It's just an easy color to choose that you know won't clash with the home colors of most teams. For a while in the late 90s/early 00s white was actually the home color. Which I disliked.
EdmontonOilers,3cxgch,Panencephalitis,1 point,Sun Jul 12 06:45:01 2015 UTC,Is the oilers shop (http://shop.nhl.com/Edmonton_Oilers_Jerseys) in american Currency?
EdmontonOilers,3cxgch,Goregutz,1 point,Thu Jul 16 07:03:07 2015 UTC,I don't run the Oilers shop so I wouldn't know. I imagine there is an option for displaying the price in CAD or USD. I would imagine the default is CAD but who knows.
EdmontonOilers,3cxgch,Panencephalitis,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:51:33 2015 UTC,"I love this one, although it's probably primarily because it's the only Oilers jersey I own that fits, and mine is a Smytty jersey."
EdmontonOilers,3cxgch,shweet44722,4,Sat Jul 11 18:19:27 2015 UTC,What jersey is that? I've never seen it before.
EdmontonOilers,3cxgch,Goregutz,4,Sat Jul 11 18:48:27 2015 UTC,"It was a Reebok promotional thing. They never got worn on the ice, but every team got a black jersey with their identifying colour as an accent."
EdmontonOilers,3cxgch,Girthworthy,1 point,Sat Jul 11 18:53:15 2015 UTC,Did those even go up for sale anywhere? The only place I've seen jersey's like that is on Knock-off jersey sites like aliexpress.
EdmontonOilers,3cxgch,Panencephalitis,7,Sat Jul 11 19:16:48 2015 UTC,I remember seeing them for sale in the merch shops at rexall. I wanna say they were available at the WEM jersey city also.
EdmontonOilers,3cxgch,CeleryDistraction,2,Sat Jul 11 20:03:08 2015 UTC,They were definitely available at game on sports. They were all over town when they first came out.
EdmontonOilers,3cxgch,b0r0n,1 point,Sun Jul 12 04:51:31 2015 UTC,"I'll be honest, no idea if they actually did. My dad brought it back for me from Afghanistan. Jersey feels and looks authentic, was definitely a knockoff just due to the price, but it fits well and I love it."

EdmontonOilers,3cxgch,Goregutz,1 point,Sun Jul 12 06:03:11 2015 UTC,Copper and blue is my favourite as well.
EdmontonOilers,3cusi1,OMGGGEEEE,31,Fri Jul 10 23:12:47 2015 UTC,That was a solid read.
EdmontonOilers,3cusi1,Cr4ve,3,Fri Jul 10 23:41:19 2015 UTC,The Rich Clune article is an excellent read. Scott Gomez tells and hilarious story about Ken Daneyko as well.
EdmontonOilers,3cusi1,WarmBagOfLotion,3,Sat Jul 11 00:28:07 2015 UTC,"""I'm 36 years old, how can I look this fucking good?""   I laughed hard."
EdmontonOilers,3cusi1,tvberkel,18,Sat Jul 11 14:55:46 2015 UTC,Unfortunate that sheepish fans bought into managements narrative and turned on Souray.
EdmontonOilers,3cusi1,Oat,8,Fri Jul 10 23:28:33 2015 UTC,"Tambellini's incredibly awkward press conferences, and the way he answered questions, was exhibit A on what a poor communicator he was. The way he handled the Souray situation was exhibit B."
EdmontonOilers,3cusi1,answerphoned1d6,3,Sat Jul 11 00:46:39 2015 UTC,Agreed.  I was one of them.
EdmontonOilers,3cusi1,arcticcatherder,8,Fri Jul 10 23:49:01 2015 UTC,"I initially fell for it too, ashamed to admit. Although I didn't hate the guy. Just was frustrated with him. Kind of wished it hadn't gone public at the time, only because I knew it would cause more problems getting players to sign here. But I think, internally, I knew Souray was right."
EdmontonOilers,3cusi1,9Bains,3,Fri Jul 10 23:51:01 2015 UTC,"Souray absolutely was right, but the problem was that he put the teams business out there and and made the oilers look bad publicly. Tambos original suspension made sense, even now, but it wasn't necessary to send him to the AHL in Hershey. The sad thing about it all was when we got Smytty back Colin Fraser was cleared by Oilers doctors, but was deemed to require surgery by the Kings docs, proving Sourays's point.   I had my torch out ready to burn Soura as well, until I was reminded how great he was in Anaheim."
EdmontonOilers,3cusi1,Loire55,2,Sat Jul 11 14:32:34 2015 UTC,"I thought most of us turned on him because he was paid big bucks to play, underperformed, and then publically asked for a trade.  We were all coming to realize what an inept management group we had but it still wasn't like Souray was a misunderstood saint."
EdmontonOilers,3cusi1,Oat,5,Sat Jul 11 00:16:29 2015 UTC,"He was one of our best players, stuck up for his teammates, and many wanted him to be captain before the shit-storm hit."
EdmontonOilers,3cusi1,Loire55,3,Sat Jul 11 00:30:48 2015 UTC,"It wasn't hard to be one of the best players on those teams.  We paid him 6.25 million to play 27 games and put together 10 points in 2007-08.  We paid him 5.5 million for 37 games and 13 points.   He then went on the recieve a contract worth 1/6th what we paid him with his next team.  He was our best player in 2008-2009, yes, and he was paid handsomely for it. He then took his (likely reasonable) grievances public demanding a trade. It was unprofessional and that's why the reasonable among us were upset with it."
EdmontonOilers,3cusi1,Oat,7,Sat Jul 11 00:46:14 2015 UTC,"I don't think it's ""reasonable"" to crucify and label players ""unprofessional"" for dealing with chronic injuries and speaking honestly.  He was doing fans a favor by speaking out and shining a light on the gross incompetence of our management."
EdmontonOilers,3cusi1,haterbehatin,-3,Sat Jul 11 01:14:21 2015 UTC,"My issue with him is that he's a meat head who demanded to be traded and then stupidly got in a fight and broke his hand so that he couldn't be traded.   If you're a player who wants off a team in a bad way you should be smarter than that, particularly when he wasn't a fighter like Gazdic who needs to fight to keep a job."
EdmontonOilers,3cusi1,falsekoala,2,Sat Jul 11 00:46:00 2015 UTC,I knew that Lowe and Tambellini were full of shit.
EdmontonOilers,3cusi1,ninjaspy123,10,Sat Jul 11 02:03:21 2015 UTC,"I once set up a computer in Sheldons house the summer he was aquired by the Oilers. I ended up getting to know his sister and mother a bit as well, and fixed some computers for them.  I have to say, he was just a really nice guy, very down to earth. He didn't have an overly extravagant house despite the raise the Oilers just gave him. And we chatted for a while about hockey and Edmonton, and it was so casual.   We put these guys on pedestals, but Sheldon's right, they are mostly just small town guys in the spotlight. Super normal dudes once you get to know them.  Always was a fan of his after that, and the loved the bionic wrist slap shot he had."
EdmontonOilers,3cusi1,Starsky686,3,Sat Jul 11 02:20:27 2015 UTC,Great read. It is too bad he didn't turn out to be a hometown hero.   Interesting he didn't say too much about Montreal in that letter.

EdmontonOilers,3csyrw,tvberkel,4,Fri Jul 10 15:09:28 2015 UTC,"They have to rid themselves of their dead weight first, like Bozak, JVR, and Neon Dion."
EdmontonOilers,3csyrw,MacerV,7,Fri Jul 10 15:11:08 2015 UTC,"JVR and Bozak's contracts are up in 3 years time. I imagine we'll be trying to move Bozak, but JVR is definetly tradable, and not really deadweight."
EdmontonOilers,3csyrw,metalhead4,1 point,Fri Jul 10 15:18:08 2015 UTC,JVR was dead weight for the last half of the season. He killed it for the first half though.
EdmontonOilers,3csyrw,MacerV,2,Fri Jul 10 23:05:52 2015 UTC,Everyone was dead the last half. A season under babcock will fix that.
EdmontonOilers,3csyrw,defeatedbird,2,Fri Jul 10 23:10:57 2015 UTC,"It seems as though Babcock wants to work with Dion. We like JVR, but Bozak will be on his way out. I like him, but he is not a 1C. And by the time we've rebuilt, he'll be approaching the end of his prime/declining."
EdmontonOilers,3csyrw,ghztew,0,Fri Jul 10 15:13:47 2015 UTC,"Bozak, JVR, and Neon Dion   I'm not sure.  Bozak can do the Horcoff role here - sheltering the young kids from the worst.  No reason to throw Nylander to the wolves.  JVR is an effective player and helps Bozak or Kadri out.  Dion is a player that the Red Wings tried to acquire two seasons in a row, and the rumors died down only when Babcock made the move to the Leafs.  The trade talk around Phaneuf in general has died down since Babcock got there.  He obviously trusts and wants Dion for a reason.  Given how the Oilers struggled without a #1 dman since Whitney's foot problems became insurmountable, I also think there's value in keeping Phaneuf around to keep the Leafs rebuild from spiraling out of control."
EdmontonOilers,3csyrw,ExtremeFlourStacking,1 point,Tue Jul 14 04:14:34 2015 UTC,"We also traded Marincin to you, which will be a big boost to your top 4 D. He's a young player that has been consistently getting better. For whatever reason that us fans don't know about, the Oilers and him didn't click .. but man is he good. Played some of the toughest minutes on the team and held it together. Like Petry going to the Habs, you guys will be very happy with Marincin."

EdmontonOilers,3csyrw,Shottaz83,15,Fri Jul 10 15:08:59 2015 UTC,A Leafs fan not trying to come up with contractually legal ways of stealing McDavid from Edmonton? Refreshing!  I like the cut of your jib.
EdmontonOilers,3csyrw,tvberkel,3,Fri Jul 10 15:39:49 2015 UTC,"Hahah, you did give us Marincin, so that's plenty to be grateful for. I'm happy with Marner too, once he puts on some weight and size, kid should be an absolute beauty."

EdmontonOilers,3csyrw,metalhead4,2,Fri Jul 10 17:07:36 2015 UTC,Thanks for the support. Ive actually been regularly checking out the leafs subreddit. Im glad they've finally committed to a complete long term solution for the team. Theyre my second fav team so its been a shitty decade for me watching the oilers and leafs lol. Good luck

Maybe I'm wrong. It seemed like he was leaned on in ways he shouldn't have been leaned on the first half of his rookie NHL season. He is/was one of the best d men in the KHL.

Of course not available to be woren in Edmonton, but much like Pitlick, has made his mark and can now wear the jersey he wants.  It's sort of a rookie/young guy thing. Unless you're some top prospect, you usually don't get the number you want (right away.) Same thing in major junior. I wanted 4 at the time when I played in Kelowna, but was not available. Ended up wearing 6."

EdmontonOilers,3cphtq,Lemon_Cola,1 point,Fri Jul 10 02:08:35 2015 UTC,He chose 64 because 6+4=10 obviously Yak was of high enough stature entering the league that he could pick his number

EdmontonOilers,3coxze,tsn123456789,2,Thu Jul 9 18:27:13 2015 UTC,They must be thinking about the previous year to that. He was bad and injured.  Shouldn't see much of that from the new management. (ie trading/signing players with injury history.)
EdmontonOilers,3coxze,KingDave46,2,Thu Jul 9 19:20:34 2015 UTC,I honestly see a heap of compliments for our offseason and other teams saying how good we are looking though.

Still a lot of idiotic trades making me annoyed though.

I'm not expecting us to make the playoffs, but I am expecting a lot more wins, which is very exciting.

EdmontonOilers,3cpnqy,YouJagaloon,6,Thu Jul 9 19:54:21 2015 UTC,"I don't think we're a playoff team yet (unless Talbot Dubnyk's us into the postseason) but I could see us finishing 4th in the Pacific, losing the wildcard to the Central.   We're not better than the Flames or Ducks, but while the Kings, Sharks, and Canucks are still hanging around for now (though they could all implode at any moment), they all seem very beatable. If we don't beat Arizona, something is very wrong."
EdmontonOilers,3cpnqy,Judedeath,6,Thu Jul 9 20:32:39 2015 UTC,"So 4th in pacific lose the wildcard to central, do we then go on to win the lottery and pick 1st overall again?"

EdmontonOilers,3cpnqy,Loire55,4,Fri Jul 10 00:48:41 2015 UTC,"Honestly, the Stars haven't really improved where they need to, the Avs are the same, the Sharks continue their slow slide into nothingness as does Vancouver, Arizona seems set to take tanking to a new level.  I honestly don't see us below 9th in the west but it's the Oilers so who knows, maybe we'll get Mathews."
EdmontonOilers,3cpnqy,But-Seriously-Though,7,Thu Jul 9 22:10:46 2015 UTC,"I don't know how far behind the flames we really are, they got lucky last year IMO, they have one forward line that would be our 2nd line and their D is hella good, you replace their D with an average team (I won't say ours yet) they would be looking at the lottery.... Maybe that's to much rivalry bias but my jaw wouldn't hit the floor if they take a step back and finish behind us."
EdmontonOilers,3cpnqy,But-Seriously-Though,2,Thu Jul 9 21:19:42 2015 UTC,Truthfull the Canucks finishing last then losing the lottery all 3 times so they have to pick 4th would almost be as satisfying as us finishing between 9th and 12th in the division
EdmontonOilers,3cpnqy,RoboNerdOK,2,Thu Jul 9 21:17:34 2015 UTC,"Honestly I see our total points increasing by 16-28. Goaltending upgrade worth between 4-8, centre upgrade 2-4, blue line 4-8, coaching 6-8 (heck, probably more considering the lingering effects from the Eakins experiment). Less than 20 points improvement would constitute a failure in my opinion, while greater than 24 would constitute a successful development of the team.  Seeing as how we would need 37 additional points to place 8th in last season's standings... I have a hard time believing we can jump that far ahead in one season. Not that I'd complain if proven wrong!"

EdmontonOilers,3cqw1h,defeatedbird,8,Fri Jul 10 01:27:21 2015 UTC,I like Sekera better as a long term option. 5 years max for Seabrook but we also don't have a Keith to compliment his style of play.
EdmontonOilers,3cqw1h,DocDiggler,1 point,Fri Jul 10 02:23:30 2015 UTC,I think he'd be a guy who might be interesting in free agency but he's not interesting at all as a trade target unless it's a Boychuk type trade.
EdmontonOilers,3cqw1h,haterbehatin,2,Fri Jul 10 02:29:06 2015 UTC,To me it just seems like he's making up for the money he lost signing with Chicago for a discount. If he were UFA the situation would probably be no different than Franson asking for too much money and term and having to wait for a deal to get done.
EdmontonOilers,3cqw1h,DocDiggler,1 point,Fri Jul 10 03:05:40 2015 UTC,Yeah he could be even worse than Franson too because he has a better reputation but he'll be signing that deal at 31 vs Franson I believe is 28.   I wonder what will happen with Franson if he'll sign a 1 year deal with somebody and try to get paid next summer or if he ends up in say Arizona on a 4 or 5 year deal at less money than he was hoping for.
EdmontonOilers,3cqw1h,haterbehatin,2,Fri Jul 10 03:12:31 2015 UTC,It also seems like the trend towards stupid money being thrown around is starting to die out as well. Most of the contracts signed this offseason seem to be for reasonable money and term.   Cap space is at a premium going forward and the fact there was an escalator in place isn't making the argument for contracts being a good value down the road realistic.
EdmontonOilers,3cqw1h,DocDiggler,2,Fri Jul 10 03:31:09 2015 UTC,"Yeah there's been a couple articles lately about teams valuing cap space for another Leddy and Boychuk situation as well as RFA's getting paid and locked up now. Friedman mentioned people snickering at the Oilers for locking up Hall, Eberle and Nuge but admitting in retrospect that they were good deals.   The other potential factor with the Canadian dollar sinking and being projected to sink another 14 cents teams should be planning on the cap not growing as it had been projected to in the past."
EdmontonOilers,3cqw1h,haterbehatin,2,Fri Jul 10 03:51:52 2015 UTC,"I remember thinking Nuge making ROR money was insane but even the price of ROR money went up within that time. I'm just wondering what that point in the future will look like when we can't afford to keep all the core players together. A contract like Seabrooks could put us in the same hole as the Hawks except with no cups to show for it.   Damn, unless we buy out a few players we're pretty much done with the free agent market and we only have a couple mil left to play around with."
EdmontonOilers,3cqw1h,DocDiggler,1 point,Fri Jul 10 04:20:19 2015 UTC,I think in a few years they'll be able to move Pouliot and that should help create some room long term to keep the big names. So hopefully there's room to keep the core together.
EdmontonOilers,3cqw1h,haterbehatin,13,Fri Jul 10 04:51:12 2015 UTC,We're likely not sniffing a cup within the next 3 years which is when McDavid's ELC expires and by then Seabrook will be pushing 35 so I don't see how it's possible that he doesn't become an anchor by that time.
EdmontonOilers,3cqw1h,tsn123456789,8,Fri Jul 10 01:40:20 2015 UTC,"He'll be 33 not 35, and I highly doubt he'll become useless at 33."
EdmontonOilers,3cqw1h,notsoyoungpadawan,1 point,Fri Jul 10 03:30:38 2015 UTC,"I never said he'll be useless, just not worth the big contract he's looking for. Same reason Flames fans don't want to give Giordano 9M who's far better than Seabrook. By McDavid's 4th season (18-19), he'll be 34, he's certainly going to drop off. If he wants an 8 year contract (which likely will include a NMC) that's only the start of the 3rd year. Plus we have Yak, Nurse, Klefbom, Reinhart coming off of ELCs within the next 3 years and Hall/Eberle/Nuge needing new deals; at that time do you want a 34yo Seabrook taking up 10% of your cap space? Do you think a 34yo Seabrook will be good enough to be worth 10% of your cap space?"
EdmontonOilers,3cqw1h,tsn123456789,1 point,Fri Jul 10 14:49:39 2015 UTC,"Far better than Seabrook? Uh, I don't know about that. Just because he scores more doesn't automatically make him ""far better.""  By McDavid's 4th season he'll still be 33. His birthday is in April, so if we sign him this summer he'll spend an entire season with us aged 30. And top pairing defencemen like Seabrook don't drop off at 34 anyway. After 35 maybe. MAYBE. You look at Chara and how he only had his worst season at the age of 37/38.  On the issue of his contract, read this article by Gregor. He suggests offering $8-$9m AAV for 5 years, which would put us in a very good position considering the cap and his age, while delivering virtually the same amount of money he'd accumulate over a 7 or 8 year period.   Plus we have Yak, Nurse, Klefbom, Reinhart coming off of ELCs within the next 3 years and Hall/Eberle/Nuge needing new deals; at that time do you want a 34yo Seabrook taking up 10% of your cap space?    You are assuming our team stays exactly the same for the duration of 5 years. There is a chance Reinhart doesn't pan out. There is a chance a certain dynamic of the team needs to be improved to make us more efficient, for which we may have to give up Yak. I mean, there are so many different variables and possibilities that when you say we have to renew those contracts, I don't see how we'd be able to renew all those contracts to keep everyone AND get new players in too. Something has to give. We only have about $7m in cap space this year anyway. That increases by $9 next season after Purcell + Nikitin are done. If Yak does well he'll want a $5-$6m contract. Drai will want good terms. Nurse will want a good contract. Talbot needs a new contract. Brossoit needs a new contract. What if Schultz has a breakout season and we need to sign him? Plus renewing McDavid on a bumper contract. I don't see how we'd be able to keep everyone anyway.   Do you think a 34yo Seabrook will be good enough to be worth 10% of your cap space?   Yes I do. Ignoring your opinion about Seabrook dropping off at 34, I really don't understand what your solution is for our defence. What would you have us do? You don't want us to pick up a top pairing defenceman when that is exactly what we need and what we've needed for like 9 years. Would you really have said no to Seabrook before we got McDavid? Because there is literally no other way we can get a proven top pairing D-man. I also don't agree with you that we are incapable of winning the cup in the next 5 years. Crosby won it after his first 3 years in Pittsburgh on a team that was much farther behind on their rebuild schedule. I mean, do you seriously not see Nurse, Klefbom, Hall, Nuge, Drai being elite players in 3-4 years? I just don't get the reason behind your negativity."

His birthday is in April, so if we sign him this summer he'll spend an entire season with us aged 30. And top pairing defencemen like Seabrook don't drop off at 34 anyway. After 35 maybe. MAYBE. You look at Chara and how he only had his worst season at the age of 37/38.   Well that's just getting nitpicky IMO. He'll be in his mid-30's and 34 by the time playoffs start in McDavid's 4th year. Besides, it's not like there's a specific date that a guy's performance falls off a cliff. Chara's longevity is a special case, it's far more common to see D declining once they are in their mid-30's than not. Also keep in mind that Seabrooks' played a ridiculous number of games the past few years when including playoffs, he has a lot more miles than most D.   On the issue of his contract, read this article by Gregor. He suggests offering $8-$9m AAV for 5 years, which would put us in a very good position considering the cap and his age, while delivering virtually the same amount of money he'd accumulate over a 7 or 8 year period.   Phaneuf got a 7x7 two years ago, Seabrook will easily beat that. An 8x8 is not out of the question. Besides even at a 5 year deal, 9AAV doesn't help us at all because we'd still run into all of our ELCs plus Ebs/Hall running out in during time. The only difference is that Seabrook's contract might be easier to move, but chances are its' gonna have a NMC attached to it. In any case none of this matters, because we're talking about trading for Seabrook, not signing him in UFA.   You are assuming our team stays exactly the same for the duration of 5 years. There is a chance Reinhart doesn't pan out. There is a chance a certain dynamic of the team needs to be improved to make us more efficient, for which we may have to give up Yak. I mean, there are so many different variables and possibilities that when you say we have to renew those contracts, I don't see how we'd be able to renew all those contracts to keep everyone AND get new players in too. Something has to give. We only have about $7m in cap space this year anyway. That increases by $9 next season after Purcell + Nikitin are done. If Yak does well he'll want a $5-$6m contract. Drai will want good terms. Nurse will want a good contract. Talbot needs a new contract. Brossoit needs a new contract. What if Schultz has a breakout season and we need to sign him? Plus renewing McDavid on a bumper contract. I don't see how we'd be able to keep everyone anyway.   Yes and that is exactly why you don't sign a guy like Seabrook to a large cap hit. If what you say is true, adding a large cap hit makes things even worse. In the cap era you sign large contracts and NMC/NTC to elite young talents you build your team around for the next decade, not someone over 30. Outside of maybe Chara there isn't many cases where that kind of a signing didn't start to back fire at least half way into the deal. Phaneuf's already backfired 2 years in, amongst others. We have to maintain flexibility with a hard cap, that's the only way to not walk ourselves into a corner by cap locking ourselves like Chia did in Boston. Flexibility is key; when you have flexibility you can deal with the scenarios you mentioned above and more that you don't see coming.    Yes I do. Ignoring your opinion about Seabrook dropping off at 34, I really don't understand what your solution is for our defence. What would you have us do? You don't want us to pick up a top pairing defenceman when that is exactly what we need and what we've needed for like 9 years. Would you really have said no to Seabrook before we got McDavid? Because there is literally no other way we can get a proven top pairing D-man.    In this league you simply don't get an established top pairing D without overpaying, and in a cap era it is key to not overpay, whether it be with cap or assets, especially on a team that is still rebuilding and not a legit contender (and adding McDavid doesn't make us contenders).   The only way to get a top pairing D is to develop them yourself or trade for one before they are established. That's what Chia tried to do with Reinhart (though I don't like the move); that's what COL did with Erik Johnson. You could even add Phaneuf to that list until Toronto decided to overpay him. It doesn't take a genius to dump a bunch of assets and overpay for Seabrook, MacT could've done that. We brought in Chia to make smarter decisions and finding value in places where no one else has.   I also don't agree with you that we are incapable of winning the cup in the next 5 years. Crosby won it after his first 3 years in Pittsburgh on a team that was much farther behind on their rebuild schedule. I mean, do you seriously not see Nurse, Klefbom, Hall, Nuge, Drai being elite players in 3-4 years? I just  don't get the reason behind your negativity.   We're in a different situation. Lemieux didn't make it until year 7. Lindros never won a cup. The West is stacked; ANA, CHI, LAK will be at the top for a couple more years; there's up and coming teams like the Jets and Flames, and you can even throw the Stars in there if they can get a D corp. I'm not being negative, I'm being realistic; outside of Hall none of the guys you listed have proven themselves enough on the NHL ice to attach the elite label to them, now or 4 years from now. Will they be? I really hope so, but I'm not going to put ridiculous expectations on 18-20 yos."

Why are you still using 34? 33. 33 is not mid-thirties. Its not nitpicking because it means 1 additional full year of service. I'm also correcting all the false numbers you're throwing out to exaggerate the issue to suit your argument.  What guarantee can you give me or anyone that Seabrook's game will fall off after he's 33? Absolutely none. What are the chances of his game falling off by the time he's 33? Very low.

Actually its not examples, its only 1 example which I've seen you cite over and over again on this sub. Let me just say that there is no way Seabrook gets an 8x8 contract unless he moves to a team like Buffallo. 9x5 is very achievable for signing Seabrook.

Flexibility is key; when you have flexibility you can deal with the scenarios you mentioned above and more that you don't see coming.   Firstly, wrong. Seabrook is exactly the type of D-man you build your D-core around. Wingers are the most expendable in such a scenario because they are also the most easily replaceable.   Give me some more examples aside from Phaneuf. Phaneuf was shit before he signed that contract too, so your point again is moot.   In this league you simply don't get an established top pairing D without overpaying, and in a cap era it is key to not overpay, whether it be with cap or assets, especially on a team that is still rebuilding and not a legit contender (and adding McDavid doesn't make us contenders).

It doesn't take a genius to dump a bunch of assets and overpay for Seabrook, MacT could've done that. We brought in Chia to make smarter decisions and finding value in places where no one else has.   Ok firstly, even if you develop a #1D, by the time he becomes a #1D he's going to demand big bucks. So I don't know what point you're trying to make. The only reason people say you need to develop top pairing D-men is because no team is ever willing to trade one unless they're under threat from the cap. Secondly, it is very difficult to develop legit top pairing D-men without someone with experience mentoring them. Does this mean I think Nurse will flop? No. But do I think Nurse would end up being a better player with Seabrook than without? Fuck yes.  Third, Both Eric Johnson and Phaneuf (again) are poor examples of top pairing D. Let me also add that Toronto didn't develop Phaneuf, Calgary did. Eric Johnson is no where near the level Seabrook is at. Would he be top pairing in a team like Chicago? Highly doubt it. Would Phaneuf be a top pairing D on a team like Chicago? Hell no.    We're in a different situation. Lemieux didn't make it until year 7. Lindros never won a cup.

I don't understand what point you're trying to make. Whether we win or lose isn't dependant on the other teams' quality. It is dependant on our team's quality.  In 3 years, Nurse will be 23, Draisaitl will be 23, Nuge will be 25, Hall will be 27, Ebs will be 28, McDavid will be 21, Klefbom will be 25. So I really don't know which 18-20 year olds you're referring to. And if you don't think these guys will be elite by that time then I really don't have much to discuss here with you.  Finally, you didn't answer my question. What is your suggestion? How do we improve our D core?"

So you think that Seabrook via UFA will command less money than extending a younger D who is an RFA? Buying out RFA years is always cheaper than buying out UFA years. And established talent is always more expensive than potential. If I had a choice between overpaying for a top pairing D in his 20's vs 30's I go with the guy in his 20's.     Secondly, it is very difficult to develop legit top pairing D-men without someone with experience mentoring them. Does this mean I think Nurse will flop?

I consider 33 mid-30s, you don't, agree to disagree.   Good god man, how hard is it to understand this. Seabrook’s birthday is in April, so he just turned 30 three months ago. So if we sign him for the 2015-16 season:  2015-16: McDavid’s first season - Seabrook is 30.  2016-17: McDavid’s second season - Seabrook is 31.  2017-18: McDavid’s third season - Seabrook is 32.  2018-19: McDavid’s fourth season - Seabrook is 33.  If 33 is mid-30s what is 35 and what is 36? I don’t agree to disagree because you’ve presented no reasoning behind your statement.   What guarantee can you give me that his game doesn't fall off after 33? I mean for every Chara there's a Wade Redden. If we were a legit contender I would go for it, but we're not even a playoff team right now and we can't be walking ourselves into a corner with bad contracts.   Wade Redden didn’t win the Stanley Cup three times. In fact, he didn’t even win it once. So no, he doesn’t compare to Chara or Seabrook. I can’t guarantee that his game won’t fall off after 33, but based on the type of player he is and how competitive and disciplined he is, the chances of that happening are low. What I can guarantee is that our D-core gets better in the long run.   I used one example from recent times for illustration purposes. You criticize me for giving too little examples yet you're counter argument only includes two examples (one of which is a bad one).

I don't see how the Boychuck example helps your case when he hasn't even started his contract yet, that's a discussion left for 2-3 years from now.   Call it what you want, it was an atrocious example. I gave you the example of Marc Staal because he’s a top pairing D-man who recently agreed to a $5.7m six year contract. The reason the extension only takes him till 33-34 is because he’s only 28 years old. Your argument is poor.  Again you continue to inflate numbers. Have I or have I not been quoting an $8-9m FIVE year contract? So why are you still continuing arguing about a deal over six years for? Complete strawman.  Why are we still talking about Wade Redden? The guy doesn’t compare to Seabrook. Girardi’s contract is giving Rangers fans headaches? What? Niskanen is 28 years old and again, does not compare to Seabrook, especially since he doesn’t play anywhere close to top pairing minutes. Brian Campbell is a worse example. Matt Carle is a third pairing D-man, not to mention his contract is a $5.5AAV, so no where near your “Phaneuf gets paid $7m” argument.   I’ll tell you how the Boychuk example helps my case. 6x7 = $42m. 8x5 = $40m. Would I be ok if we offered Seabrook an $8mAAV for five years? Abso-fucking-lutely.   Having Seabrook at a 9AAV for 5 years actually is worse, because during that time all of our younger guys will need new deals anyhow. It will be easier to dump but in terms of cap hit it doesn't help us at all. And as far as what type of contract he's going to get, we have no idea, so I'm not sure under what basis you can put so much absolute terms behind your argument.   Again, you’re assuming we’re going to keep all of them. We most likely aren’t keeping everyone. And this type of contract was a possibility speculated by Gregor. You would’ve known that had you read the article I linked to earlier.   Where in the section you quoted did I say anything about wingers? Where did I say anything about building around Seabrook? I was talking purely from a cap standpoint. How am I ""wrong"" when (per my interpretation) your response here has nothing to do with what I said? Please clarify this for me.   You didn’t but you’ve failed to understand my point. When you build around a team around player, you make that player one of the highest paid players. Because that player is one of the most important players in your team. You speak about flexibility, but you fail to realize that the role we’d be signing Seabrook for is not flexible. You don’t adjust your team to have an ‘OK’ defence. If we face cap issues due to Seabrook’s contract, we trade wingers. That was my point. That’s how we’d end up being flexible. You cannot compromise with a top pairing defensive structure of a team. It just doesn’t work if you want to win the cup.   So you think that Seabrook via UFA will command less money than extending a younger D who is an RFA? Buying out RFA years is always cheaper than buying out UFA years. And established talent is always more expensive than potential. If I had a choice between overpaying for a top pairing D in his 20's vs 30's I go with the guy in his 20’s.   I don’t think I said that anywhere. What I said was Seabrook would cost us less in cap space if we traded for him instead of signing him as a free agent.   You absolutely need a mentor. However I disagree on the price you need to pay for said mentor.   We aren’t paying for just a mentor. He’d be able to shore up our defensive structure for years. This wouldn’t be an Andrew Ference type signing.   Both examples are gambling on top pairing guys via trade, not about developing, could add Leddy to that too. And there's the rare case of Pronger being moved. The fact that there's so few examples shows how hard even trading is. And it's not like getting top pairing guys from UFA (and overpaying at that) and building around them is a common occurrence path to playoff success. There's Chara, Niedermayer (who took less to win with his bro and needed Pronger), maybe Gonchar? That's all I could think of.   Ok for the last time.. Are Eric Johnson or Phaneuf comparable to Seabrook as players? Why should I add Leddy to that? He has done well for Isles and is far from being a Phaneuf. Is signing Seabrook really a gamble? I mean how many other defensemen can you name who play in the league who are better than him? Not more than 5 or 6. So how is getting a player such as him a gamble?   No my point is that you think we're going to win a Cup in 3 years by adding Seabrook because Crosby did it.   Pretty sure I said we can win it within 5 years not 3 years. What I said was, if Crosby can win it 3 years out of the block with a worse team then I don’t see how we can’t win it in 5 years.   IMO that's an unfair expectation to put on the team with how stacked this Western conference is.   You need to explain this further. Once again your argument is hinged on other teams’ quality rather than our team’s quality. If we play well and build a solid team, how stacked the conference has become is completely irrelevant.   I meant 20's, made a typo there, but had little to do with my overall point.   Actually it had everything to do with your overall point. here is what you said:   but I'm not going to put ridiculous expectations on 18-20 yos.   Thus suggesting that some how our players will be too young to be labeled elite. Tyler Johnson at 24, would you call him elite? How about Palat? Ryan Johansen? Brandon Saad?   Nurse and Drai has barely played in the NHL. Klefbom has one season. Ebs and Nuge each had one fantastic years and I'm hopeful they can replicate that. Please read my response again. I never said they won't be elite, I'm saying that I'm not going to start labelling these guys as elite players until they are consistently great players. And your first post didn't even include McDavid and yet you're inserting him here.   Erm, which is why I said ** in 4 years time**. And I may have missed McDavid but why wouldn’t I include him on that list?   Didn't I say either develop your own or via trade?   Lol could you be any more vague? Your solution is follow one out of the only two methods to get a top pairing defenceman, but you don’t want to specify which method, or which defenceman or how you’d go about it.   I mean take a look at past teams who's gone deep into the playoffs and look at how many of them didn't develop their own top pairing D.   Which is why are are developing our own D-men. Seabrook will be just one part of the defence. I don’t understand what you’re trying to say here at all. Maybe you’re trying to deflect I dunno."
EdmontonOilers,3cqw1h,notsoyoungpadawan,5,Sat Jul 11 07:42:08 2015 UTC,"Because I have a feeling Chia might view Eberle's contract as the window. Ie 4 years. Then Eberle, Hall and RNH have expiring deals and if Tarasenko is any indication, will cost a fortune.   Sekera-Seabrook gives us a legit top pairing in front of a potential starting goalie. We could potentially see us challenging for the playoffs from next season. We need to stop taking it slowly and amp up the pace."
EdmontonOilers,3cqw1h,RedOilSaints,1 point,Fri Jul 10 05:42:01 2015 UTC,"I'm not worried about Eberle, he's a 60pt guy, he won't get the Tarasenko contract and if he does we can move him. In fact I would move him now if I can get a good young D back. I'm all for amping up the pace, but I'm not inclined to mortgage the future to go from very far from the Cup to being slightly closer to the Cup. Cap locking yourself and destroying your flexibility will end our window for contention before we even reach it."
EdmontonOilers,3cqw1h,tsn123456789,1 point,Fri Jul 10 15:25:59 2015 UTC,"Is it mortgaging the future though? Right now our only hope of adding another top pairing dman is one of the kids developing into one. Seabrook is a legit top pairing guy. Him and Sekera is a damn good top pairing for atleast 3 seasons. If Talbot can anchor the net, we might actually accelerate our window. Ie playoffs this season.   We really can't afford to be super patient. Now I'm not saying trade one of the Crown Jewels, but other peripheral parts and cap space? I do it without thinking twice. We have the original core on cheap deals. We need to take advantage of it.   With Seabrook only having one year left and a limited NTC, I also doubt he returns one of the big names (Nurse, Drai, Klef).   If we take it nice and slowly, were gonna lose our depth of high end talent simply because we will be priced out of it. That's mortgaging both the future and the present."

Now I'm not saying trade one of the Crown Jewels, but other peripheral parts and cap space? I do it without thinking twice. We have the original core on cheap deals. We need to take advantage of it.    I never suggested being super patient, but that doesn't mean we can be super impatient because that's how you make mistakes that will cost you later on. Being impatient would be overpaying for aging FAs to win a few more games with a more dire long term consequences.   In the cap era you overpay for young elite talents, get value contracts to fill the roster, and make smart trades. You have to get the most value out of every dollar. Take a look at the last few Cup Finalists (or even Conference Finalists), how many of them got there by signing big name UFAs to big contracts.   With Seabrook only having one year left and a limited NTC, I also doubt he returns one of the big names (Nurse, Drai, Klef).    If I can get him for 2 2nds like Boychuck I'm all for it. I'm against giving him a large cap hit and a long term deal at a high AAV."
EdmontonOilers,3cqw1h,tsn123456789,1 point,Fri Jul 10 20:14:19 2015 UTC,Maybe I'm naive but I'm hoping for playoffs this year and a deep run the next or at the latest the year after that. With the young talent we have now if it's more than 3 years I think it's safe to say we've royally screwed up the rebuild... again.
EdmontonOilers,3cqw1h,bezjones,-3,Mon Jul 13 22:31:47 2015 UTC,Yay upvote for common sense.
EdmontonOilers,3cqw1h,haterbehatin,7,Fri Jul 10 01:42:16 2015 UTC,One Hawks fan thought he was worth something based around Nurse. A leafs fan said the Oilers should trade Eberle and Klefbom for him.
EdmontonOilers,3cqw1h,KingDave46,8,Fri Jul 10 02:21:48 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure I know  exactly the comments you're talking about and it got me super annoyed!   ""Also thinking they wouldn't have to give up someone like nurse in this supposed deal lol.""   It's not even the wanting Nurse that upset me, it's the fucking ""lol"" at the end their like it's laughable to believe otherwise.   FUCK THAT GUY! Absolute wankbasket on his high horse with his shitey trade ideas.  Klef + Ebs too is just silly talk. Seabrook is 30 and one year from FA. If we traded Klef and Ebs for that I would impale my stomach with an opposite boner."
EdmontonOilers,3cqw1h,Colotech,4,Fri Jul 10 02:50:45 2015 UTC,That type of shit is why I sometimes hate leafs and hawks fans. Not just the retarded ignorance of the real value of players regarding contract and age but the little arrogant digs they throw in that assume we are all idiots.
EdmontonOilers,3cqw1h,haterbehatin,3,Fri Jul 10 03:27:17 2015 UTC,Yeah it was awkward the guy made some lame justification about the Bruins giving up value which was totally irrelevant because the point was that the Oilers wouldn't do it for Dougie and he has far more value than Seabrook.   The guy who said the Klefbom and Eberle one is just an idiot. I think way too many people suffer from that same problem though in that they think every player on the Oilers is completely worthless and every player on a team like the Blackhawks is a stud because they won.
EdmontonOilers,3cqw1h,haterbehatin,0,Fri Jul 10 03:07:50 2015 UTC,And what do you believe?
EdmontonOilers,3cqw1h,oddspellingofPhreid,7,Fri Jul 10 02:30:18 2015 UTC,That both of those suggestions are completely retarded.   If they weren't willing to give up Nurse to get Hamilton there's no chance they'd give him up for Seabrook.   I wouldn't give up Klefbom or Eberle straight up for Seabrook let alone both.
EdmontonOilers,3cqw1h,oddspellingofPhreid,5,Fri Jul 10 02:34:38 2015 UTC,"Liked it originally but as others have pointed out, he doesn't fit with the cluster.  Depends on the price. If we see him as a stop gap rental and pay that price then awesome."
EdmontonOilers,3cqw1h,Rifick,-3,Fri Jul 10 02:30:20 2015 UTC,If we see him as a stop gap rental and pay that price then awesome.   Would you consider 7x$7.5m a stop-gap?  Would you even bother with a stop-gap before McDavid is ready?
EdmontonOilers,3cqw1h,Rifick,8,Fri Jul 10 02:31:12 2015 UTC,"No. Because then he wouldn't be a stop gap.  edit: And yes, because the point of a stop gap is to make the team competitive before the core matures."
EdmontonOilers,3cqw1h,Rifick,2,Fri Jul 10 02:34:29 2015 UTC,"I actually think a rental top pairing d makes sense. Gives the youngenz time to develop behind an established top pair defenceman before reassessing whether their ready to step into that role a year or two from now. The downside would of course be the price.  I'm sure the hawks are not asking rental price,  and Seabrook may not be willing to come here without the payday,  so this deal is probably off the table,  but I still think if a rental top pair D makes himself available for the right price oilers should hop on that. Feeding undeveloped defencemen top competition could set back the development of our blueline quite a bit.          Cough shultz Cough"

But unless it's cheap and all that business then I don't think he solves enough long term problems to be worth paying for.

EdmontonOilers,3cqw1h,AsOneAce11,3,Fri Jul 10 05:09:54 2015 UTC,Win now move on a win later team. It costs you Eberle in four years. Or maybe you figure out Eberle and it costs you Hall. Don't see the logic of giving that guy that money.
EdmontonOilers,3cqw1h,tsn123456789,2,Fri Jul 10 03:29:08 2015 UTC,"Would he be good? Sure, for maybe 3-4 more years max. Then you end up with an old pylon getting paid $8 million dollars a year for the next 3 years. He wants too much for too long. So I don't want him for that reason alone."
EdmontonOilers,3cqw1h,AsOneAce11,2,Fri Jul 10 01:47:46 2015 UTC,"Might've been a better option a season ago. Now we have CSP to pay and our D actually has at least one top pairing player.  He's a bit of a pipe dream now; besides, I don't want to do the Hawks any favors."
EdmontonOilers,3cqw1h,bigfatphony,2,Fri Jul 10 01:59:33 2015 UTC,"Seabrook would be a good pick-up.  But Chicago is going to want one of Klefbom or Nurse, which will be a non-starter for Chiarelli.

Probably that they were the best players available in the draft and it would be foolish to pass on the top players just because they're forwards.   The only picks you could really argue are Paajarvi and Yakupov and if people saw Trouba coming he would've been selected a lot sooner.

EdmontonOilers,3cqw1h,orionus,0,Fri Jul 10 04:39:14 2015 UTC,"You guys... Let's be reality. We cannot develop four stud defencemen at once. Klefbom, Nurse, and Reinhart all play the left side, and are all going to need top 4 minutes. Schultz needs to be developed too (if we keep him).  It's just unrealistic for us to be sitting here going, ""Derr... Keep all the prospects!!"" at this point in our rebuild. We have four dmen that are ready to take the step, and there simply will not be enough minutes for all of them to reach full potential. Aside from that, we only have Fayne on the right side who is an experienced and consistent defender that can provide on ice support for one of our kids.  With all that in mind, it's just the smart thing to do to say, ""okay we need to sacrifice a really good prospect for the good of the team"". It's where we are in our development. Klefbom could become amazing, but it's time to trade that ""maybe"" for a sure thing.  We know what Seabrook brings, and what he will bring for the next 5 years. Will he decline? Maybe, but his peak has been extremely high. Barring a freak injury, he will be a top 4 dman well in to his 30's, that's just indisputable. People are sitting here talking like he doesn't have one of the best all around toolsets in the game, and he'll become a 7th dman when he's older. That's unrealistic, that doesn't happen to dmen of Seabrooks calibre. See Francois Beauchemin, top 4 minutes at 35. And hard minutes too.  People are saying if we trade for Seabrook, it's a ""win now"" move. But really it's a ""win now, and make sure our prospects have the support they need to win later too"" move. It's absolutely mind boggling to me that there are people here saying, ""Seabrook? Nah, we'd rather have just Fayne to take care of our 20-22 year old left side d-men."" That is just a brutal way to look at development.   Seabrook makes us better now, and in the future. If we can, we need to go for it."
EdmontonOilers,3cqw1h,tsn123456789,4,Fri Jul 10 05:42:10 2015 UTC,Let's indeed be reality. No GM in his right mind trades Klefbom+ for a pending free agent. If he doesn't sign here that makes us slightly better for one year. After that you've given away Klefbom for literally nothing.   Bad asset management.
EdmontonOilers,3cm0jc,envague,24,Wed Jul 8 23:19:57 2015 UTC,"Darnell Nurse   Ceiling - Chris Pronger (mean, intimidating, 2-way Dman, stands forwards up at the blue line and triggers the offense with the perfect, outlet pass) Floor - Jason Smith (hard, dependable, leader in the locker room, blocks every shot possible but doesn't appear often on the score sheet)"
EdmontonOilers,3cm0jc,Tylemaker,20,Wed Jul 8 23:24:02 2015 UTC,"I've been thinking long and hard about this for CSP.   Floor - Patrick Kane. Barring any injury, I don't really see McDavid being any worse than Kane. I say Kane, as they are a little similar, mostly in that they are dynamic offensive threats. McDavid will be a dangerous offensive threat in this league. Ceiling - Connor McDavid. I couldn't pick a current player. He plays a different style than Crosby, and he has a small chance of being better than Sid. To me, his ceiling is perennial top scorer in the league, and consistent Hart Trophy winner. Expectations - For me, I think he'll be somewhere in between. Similar numbers to Malkin kind of thing."
EdmontonOilers,3cm0jc,areyouhappynowethan,12,Wed Jul 8 23:40:22 2015 UTC,I agree with this. If CSP is Crosby+ he falls in a category all by himself below 99 and 66.

EdmontonOilers,3clioi,McEirhead,2,Thu Jul 9 14:56:36 2015 UTC,I don't see Chia thinking like MacT and handing anyone anything. I expect Darnell to beat out a couple vets based on effort alone. The kid has intangibles that guys like Ference and Nikitin don't - hunger.

EdmontonOilers,3cimos,br4ndnewbr4d,6,Wed Jul 8 17:57:55 2015 UTC,http://oilers.nhl.com/club/news.htm?id=772311  There's a link to the pre-order on that page as well.
EdmontonOilers,3cimos,LordVarian,3,Wed Jul 8 05:35:12 2015 UTC,"For those who cant open the link    (Edmonton, AB) – A special addition to the Edmonton Oilers Farewell Season at Rexall Place was unveiled today as the Oilers presented their new orange jersey to Connor McDavid, the Oilers first-overall selection, at the 2015 NHL Draft.  The design of the new jersey was inspired by one worn by the Oilers early in the franchise’s life as a member of the World Hockey Association. The orange jersey will be worn for seven select home games during the Farewell Season at Rexall Place, including Opening Night on Thursday, October 15 against the St. Louis Blues.  “This new orange jersey is an exciting addition to the roster of jerseys worn by the Edmonton Oilers over the last 40 years. It is both contemporary and fresh, while also paying homage to the great history of the organization,” said Oilers Entertainment Group CEO & Vice Chair Bob Nicholson. “The wave of orange is going to look great during our Farewell Season at Rexall Place, and beyond.”  Fans can pre-order the new Oilers orange jersey now by clicking here or the Oilers Store in Kingsway Mall. The jerseys will be available for purchase in store this fall.  Edmonton Oilers hockey is presented by Molson Canadian, Rogers, Ford, Scotiabank and the Rexall Family of Pharmacies."
EdmontonOilers,3cimos,Girthworthy,3,Wed Jul 8 14:07:27 2015 UTC,"During our farewell season at Rexall Place, and beyond.   So, longer than one season?  Edit: well I certainly hope we add it for future seasons. It's a fine looking sweater."

EdmontonOilers,3cimos,Girthworthy,5,Wed Jul 8 05:47:15 2015 UTC,"i would be disappointed, but i could see them doing it as like a ""farewell rexall"" jersey. i imagine now with Mcdavid, they will try all sorts of new jerseys to milk as much money out of the crazed fans as possible. Which as one of those aforementioned crazed fans, i would buy every one"

EdmontonOilers,3cimos,Fremore,3,Thu Jul 9 05:24:12 2015 UTC,I'm so glad they've decided to do a third like this and I really want to get one.    I'm really hoping I can get a McDavid one in the fall from the NHL store
EdmontonOilers,3cimos,IAMA-CANADIAN-AMA,2,Wed Jul 8 14:37:52 2015 UTC,No its going to last more than one season
EdmontonOilers,3cimos,putzeh,2,Wed Jul 8 12:01:49 2015 UTC,The contract with Rebok with the NHL for the jersery's expires after this season.  Potential for new home/away in the new arena. If the jersey ends up being as popular as expected. Could become the new staple jersey.
EdmontonOilers,3cimos,haterbehatin,2,Wed Jul 8 14:19:07 2015 UTC,"I hope it doesn't become the new regular home, it's fine as an alternate though."
EdmontonOilers,3cimos,putzeh,2,Wed Jul 8 14:47:16 2015 UTC,I'm hopefully not one of the few who wants the league to go back to white's for home and dark's for away.
EdmontonOilers,3cimos,YouJagaloon,10,Wed Jul 8 15:26:34 2015 UTC,I want the league to allow everyone to wear their colors unless there's a conflict. The Detroit/Toronto winter classic looked amazing with both blue and red on the ice.
EdmontonOilers,3cimos,LuckyCanuck13,2,Wed Jul 8 15:47:32 2015 UTC,"That's how it works in Euro soccer. You wear your coloured jersey unless there is a conflict, in which case the home team switches jerseys.   It my be more difficult in hockey just because the game's pace is so much quicker."
EdmontonOilers,3cimos,stelts94,1 point,Wed Jul 8 20:48:15 2015 UTC,The away team switches jerseys. The home team can wear whatever it wants. The away team has to make sure the colours don't conflict. I hope this happens with the NHL
EdmontonOilers,3cimos,haterbehatin,2,Thu Jul 9 20:02:43 2015 UTC,I'm a huge fan of teams wearing whites at home. I would love for the league to go back to that.
EdmontonOilers,3cimos,Spoonfeedme,1 point,Wed Jul 8 16:19:12 2015 UTC,"I for one am still hoping they do a U of A golden bears homage jersey at some point.  I know some might disagree with me, but I think the green and gold is a perfect tribute to sports in general in this city."
EdmontonOilers,3cjltf,AlpineVW,38,Wed Jul 8 12:34:47 2015 UTC,Hopefully nobody.  That ship has sailed; stick optional players are done.
EdmontonOilers,3cjltf,Dr_Marxist,13,Wed Jul 8 12:52:56 2015 UTC,"Completely agree. The NHL is becoming a much faster, harder hitting game where all 4 lines need to be able to compete and score. Whereas in the past the 4th line/energy line was out there to enforce .. now it may be slightly specialized more toward being a defensive line that takes tough defensive zone starts. (I.e. what Boyd Gordon's line did since he was really good at face offs).  Will miss Boyd."
EdmontonOilers,3cjltf,ghztew,5,Wed Jul 8 13:25:34 2015 UTC,"Don't expect TMac to run that hard zone start line. He never did so in SJ, and the trading away of Gordon basically ensures that idea is dead.  Those obscene own zone start lines are, IMO, only useful if they can actually generate something in the opposing end. Gordon was great at winning face offs but outside of PK you can just wire it off the glass and end things there. You throw him out against the Kanes and Crosbys of the world and you might force them to regroup, but you haven't actually forced them back into their own end.   In this regard, a hard skating, hard hitting 4th line who can take and make a pass is far better, and that's what it looks like we'll have this year. Even if you only force the play in the neutral zone, wasting a shift of Crosby can be the difference between a GA or not."
EdmontonOilers,3cjltf,Spoonfeedme,4,Wed Jul 8 19:31:57 2015 UTC,One look at Letestu and we'll be wondering who that Boyd fellow was. Can handle the tough starts while also bringing a two-way game.
EdmontonOilers,3cjltf,wallsallbrassbuttons,1 point,Wed Jul 8 15:48:19 2015 UTC,I hope it's true and we don't have opponents taking cheap shots at our guys.
EdmontonOilers,3cjltf,fudgeyouman,2,Wed Jul 8 13:23:16 2015 UTC,"Do you remember MacIntyre? Eberle, Gagner and Hall were run frequently while he glared at the opposition from the bench.   They have to be able to play."
EdmontonOilers,3cjltf,IamMcLovin2015,0,Mon Jul 13 03:01:13 2015 UTC,I assume Nurse will be the guy if needed hes probably most willing and able to fight if someone does a dirty hit or something i could see nurse going crazy and pummeling anyone in sight
EdmontonOilers,3cjltf,DJ80,5,Wed Jul 8 13:33:35 2015 UTC,"Nurse can't be that guy.  We need him on the ice, not spending 1/4 of a period (plus time til stoppage) with his butt stapled to a bench."
EdmontonOilers,3cjltf,gum-,6,Wed Jul 8 14:14:19 2015 UTC,Doesn't mean he has to fight. Pronger rarely dropped the gloves but he was effective AF at protecting his team.
EdmontonOilers,3cjltf,IamMcLovin2015,2,Wed Jul 8 15:35:50 2015 UTC,its not like it would be expected to be a regular thing im talkin bout those moments when you need to get back at someone like ference finally did to kassian which are pretty rare i would say he will be an iginla type enforcer good player but scrapper too
EdmontonOilers,3cjltf,YouJagaloon,10,Wed Jul 8 14:20:19 2015 UTC,Nuge
EdmontonOilers,3cjltf,br4ndnewbr4d,6,Wed Jul 8 15:16:24 2015 UTC,I actually thought Nuge won that fight. Maybe im just biased.
EdmontonOilers,3cjltf,Loire55,1 point,Wed Jul 8 17:52:34 2015 UTC,"Hamhuis landed quite a few bombs while Nuge was throwing soft jabs, a couple of which missed."
EdmontonOilers,3cjltf,broccolifucker,1 point,Wed Jul 8 18:30:51 2015 UTC,"This is true of that fight, but he lost in a different way than some of our 'kids' lose. I think he's got thirty more lbs to put on, and he throws the odd good check while not getting wrestled off the puck in the corners that often. He's not going to be a scrapper or enforcer like we remember from years gone by, but he might be a bit of a tough guy in the next x years. Hall and Yak will get heavier, too, Eberle is the only one who I don't see becoming much of a physical player, but he has hands and a style which don't need him to be, especially if he gets better. If the league is going to a point where straight up enforcers are extinct, fights will still happen; they'll just be the toughest of the skilled guys."
EdmontonOilers,3cjltf,papercutpete,9,Thu Jul 9 08:41:30 2015 UTC,All it takes is a few teams to start bullying other teams and the arms race is on again.
EdmontonOilers,3cjltf,shweet44722,5,Wed Jul 8 13:56:46 2015 UTC,"And those teams gets smoked by teams like Anaheim, Chicago and really any team with players that have a combination of size, skill and a bit of speed.  If you have an ""enforcer"" who can keep up with the skilled guys, can produce points and not be a severe liability every time he's on the ice, then great...except that's no longer an enforcer by definition, that's a power forward. Power forwards are the new enforcers. They hit, play hard in the corners, and don't take shit from anyone, produce points but are still effective players on both ends of the rinks. There are very few players who can simply play one way games, or have a set role on the ice nowadays. You have to be a multipurpose player, or you'll get pushed out of your position by someone who is.  Guys like Parros, Laraque, and unfortunately Gazdic are no longer useful to teams because they're weakpoints to be taken advantage of. 10-15 years ago Gazdic would be perfect for the Oilers, playing a big part in defending the fast, skilled players and to play with energy. Nowadays, those guys just get walked around and cause more problems than they solve, especially with the instigator penalties."
EdmontonOilers,3cjltf,papercutpete,-6,Wed Jul 8 16:35:47 2015 UTC,"Do not over think it,  you just need an enforcer who will not hurt your team.  Easier said than done,  yes."
EdmontonOilers,3cjltf,shweet44722,5,Wed Jul 8 17:19:54 2015 UTC,"If you can find one of those nowadays, they're deemed power forwards. Simply not hurting a team isn't a good enough reason up keep players around in the faster NHL."
EdmontonOilers,3cjltf,papercutpete,-1,Wed Jul 8 19:43:05 2015 UTC,"For now,  that can change if teams deliberately dress very tough guys.    It has been an effective strategy in the past,  the rules have not really changed to stop it and it will take one team to do it.  There would be a response.  Especially once you see a team's ""power forward"" get their asses handed to them by a true fighter.   You watch,  some one is going to do it."
EdmontonOilers,3cjltf,shweet44722,1 point,Wed Jul 8 20:33:47 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry, I just have to fully disagree. Any team that dresses players like that is going to get their asses beat into the ground. Most fighters don't have good enough foot speed to keep up with 3rd liners let alone the best players in the league. The holding, hit to the head, instigator and generally more stringent regulations on hitting and fighting are making the pure bred fighter a thing of the past.  It could happen...for a game or two maybe, but a team that has pure fighters won't win. Mainly because the score will get run up on them, but primarily because there won't necessarily be takers for a fight. It won't intimidate players, they just won't drop the gloves because it's more costly than it does good now. There's a place for fighting, but you don't need fighters like Boogard or Parros to fill your lineup in order to be successful. That's just the reality of the faster, bigger NHL."

EdmontonOilers,3cjltf,gum-,5,Wed Jul 8 15:37:52 2015 UTC,"Last year was pretty embarrassing for that. I strongly feel McClellan is going to refresh the group, give clear, simple instructions, and the boys are going to thrive. It's going to be fun to be an Oiler again!"
EdmontonOilers,3cjltf,br4ndnewbr4d,2,Wed Jul 8 15:55:17 2015 UTC,Agree 100%!  Don't remember the last time I was this excited for a season to start.
EdmontonOilers,3cjltf,defeatedbird,-2,Wed Jul 8 17:54:13 2015 UTC,I thought they got better under Nelson.
EdmontonOilers,3cjltf,shweet44722,2,Thu Jul 9 13:19:03 2015 UTC,"Maybe 'enforcer' isn't the word I should have used, but we all saw what happened last year when Scrivens was run into.  No one did anything to have his back.    I don't want the same thing to happen if someone takes a cheap shot at McJesus.  EDIT: Confusing grammar"
EdmontonOilers,3cjltf,notsoyoungpadawan,6,Wed Jul 8 13:40:38 2015 UTC,"There's a difference between complete apathy and needing an enforcer though. Yes, someone should have stood up for Scrivens and there were many instances where players were left alone in scrums, but that doesn't mean we need a guy who can't skate or play at an NHL level to lay down the law."
EdmontonOilers,3cjltf,But-Seriously-Though,2,Wed Jul 8 16:37:20 2015 UTC,I remember that. Schultz was on the ice and I remember him just looking at what had happened and just skating off to the bench. It was so infuriating to watch. Even if you are the smallest player on the ice you get into the other team's face if they run your goalie. I don't give a shit what happens to you. You stand up for your teammates. This is one of the main reasons why I can't stand Jultz. His compete and passion level for the team and his teammates is close to non-existent.
EdmontonOilers,3cjltf,haterbehatin,2,Wed Jul 8 18:38:20 2015 UTC,"Gazdic is still around, I get the feeling that if there is a game Coming up against a team with a history of bad blood or a team that took a shot at one of your guys earlier in the year Gazdic would play and GAZDIC SMASH"
EdmontonOilers,3cjltf,putzeh,5,Wed Jul 8 14:56:13 2015 UTC,"I hope Gazdic is in Bakersfield where he belongs, he's just not an NHL level player so there's no reason for him to be on the roster."
EdmontonOilers,3cjltf,Capsluck,0,Wed Jul 8 18:03:59 2015 UTC,Don't forget the Oilers picked up Gryba. 6'4 222 lbs. http://www.hockeyfights.com/players/6564
EdmontonOilers,3ci4sc,bigfatphony,20,Wed Jul 8 02:20:09 2015 UTC,"Okay shoot me down here, but I heard from someone who played golf with an employee of seabrooks agency a few weeks ago that he had two teams on his ""will trade to"" list and that Edmonton was one of them.   Yes I know if I read this comment I wouldn't believe it either."
EdmontonOilers,3ci4sc,lyrapan,11,Wed Jul 8 03:04:08 2015 UTC,"I don't really want them to trade for him either way, I don't think he's worth the assets it would take to acquire him and Edmonton isin't in a real win now situation at the moment anyways.   If he wants to sign with Edmonton as a free agent next summer that'd be cool though."
EdmontonOilers,3ci4sc,haterbehatin,5,Wed Jul 8 03:40:11 2015 UTC,I would only give picks for any rental.  And low rounds.  Maybe a shite prospect.  Nobody is gonna pay more to help the Stanley Cup Champions out of their cap troubles.
EdmontonOilers,3ci4sc,Dr_Marxist,1 point,Wed Jul 8 05:10:22 2015 UTC,"I don't think anyone should anyways, the rumoured asking price for Sharp is just nuts possibly why he's still there.   I do think with Saad out of the picture now they can probably manage the cap for this year at least just by moving Bickell.  The logical thing would be for them to keep Seabrook and take another shot at the Cup but then again I said the same thing about Boychuk and the Bruins so who knows."
EdmontonOilers,3ci4sc,haterbehatin,2,Wed Jul 8 05:13:02 2015 UTC,"I agree.  It's not worth it.  MacT was right: this is a rebuild year.  It just can't be one without forward momentum.    There are good options next year to bolster the blue line.  No reason to jump the gun when we can buy out TCAF and then trade Nikitin for beans at the deadline.  And Purcell is gone next year, and can be easily replaced from the farm.  Buyout TCAF, trade NN for beans at the deadline, bolster the blue for a serious push next year, and a Cup run the year after."
EdmontonOilers,3ci4sc,Dr_Marxist,2,Wed Jul 8 05:45:32 2015 UTC,What are the chances of him hitting free agency next and not being offered mammoth deals? Probably next to none. Odds are we'd have to overpay quite a bit more next summer than if we traded for him this season. A deal where we give up Reinhart plus Scrivens and a pick would be A-OK with me.
EdmontonOilers,3ci4sc,notsoyoungpadawan,1 point,Thu Jul 9 01:59:31 2015 UTC,"If you trade for him now you're mortgaging the future for a 30 plus defenseman who's made it be known he wants a massive extension.   If you try to sign him as a free agent he comes without costing any assets so if you can sign him for a reasonable deal you do, if not you simply see what else is out there.   Why would Chicago want to trade for Scrivens?"
EdmontonOilers,3ci4sc,haterbehatin,3,Thu Jul 9 02:14:56 2015 UTC,"I get the feeling that people are really underestimating seabrook as a player here. If the Oilers have any shot at acquiring him, they should take it. I get that we're not in a position to win now, but that's just based on last season, and to be fair, the last two years were absolutely botched by dallas eakins. I think if we had seabrook, mclellan, chiarelli, sekera and didn't have mcdavid, the oilers would make the playoffs next year. With CSP, I think seabrook would be that stabilizing anchor that would make us as tough defensively as chicago is."
EdmontonOilers,3ci4sc,SNPmarty009,2,Thu Jul 9 00:39:23 2015 UTC,"Vague as fuck, as always.  It's not that I don't think Seabrook is an option, I just don't see why Chicago would let him go. Let other guys walk to make cap."
EdmontonOilers,3ci4sc,falsekoala,1 point,Wed Jul 8 09:21:30 2015 UTC,"Plenty of good young defense prospects would be the reason they would consider letting him go, and he is an aging asset who plays on their second pairing. If he's not giving a home town discount in negotiations, he's out the door at some point. It becomes a matter of whether they think they can get return worth more than a final season of Seabrooke's services. If he wants money and term he's not getting that from Chicago."
EdmontonOilers,3ci4sc,A5hcrack,1 point,Wed Jul 8 14:10:39 2015 UTC,He plays on their top pairing with Duncan Keith.
EdmontonOilers,3ci4sc,haterbehatin,1 point,Wed Jul 8 14:41:04 2015 UTC,He used to. This season they split them up.
EdmontonOilers,3ci4sc,A5hcrack,1 point,Wed Jul 8 15:18:25 2015 UTC,"When? Their combos in the playoffs were Keith and Seabrook, Oduya and Hjalmarsson and then third pairing fodder."
EdmontonOilers,3ci4sc,haterbehatin,2,Wed Jul 8 15:24:21 2015 UTC,"They were split up for the majority of their ice time in the playoffs and Quinville had been using them apart for a ton of the second half, trying to get more than two pairings going. Keith spent most of his time with Roszival 5on5 in the playoffs until Roszival's injury, then Runblad and finally Hjalmarasson, Seabrooke switched out Oduya and Timonen for most of his ice time 5on5.  There was no real third pairing, it was just a constant diet of Keith, with 5-10 per game being Seabrook beside him, the rest whichever other guy had been shoved up there, with Oduya and Timonen sharing, admittedly unevenly in Oduya's favor the 30 minutes Keith wasn't on the ice, 15-18 of that time with Seabrook. When neither Keith nor Seabrook were on the ice it was invariably Hjalmarasson and Oduya in a shutdown role for that 15 or so minutes. They kept either Seabrook or Keith on the ice for 45 minutes of the game.   Honestly it was brilliant coaching in Quenville's part. The two were on the ice together, but only for Four to six shifts per game when they needed some offensive punch. If you look at articles about Chicago's blue line through the season, from real sources, not copy post bleacher report stuff gushing about how Keith and Seabrook are the greatest defensive pair in the history of hockey, you'll see a ton of tinkering in the top four all season. They played different partner groups situationally throughout the game in the playoffs which allowed them to shield their lackluster 5 and 6 defenseman without playing them at the same time. I would actually be surprised if that didn't start happening a lot more in the future. That's how their terrible 5-7 defense are all statistically pretty good, they weren't playing as a traditional third pair all that much for most of the season."
EdmontonOilers,3ci4sc,A5hcrack,4,Wed Jul 8 16:32:06 2015 UTC,"A big run at Seabrook could explain picking up Reinhart and Nilsson. The Oilers now have the luxury of being able to ship out a stud defensive prospect, and Scrivens in a package to the Hawks for Seabrook.   In my opinion, the Oilers having two up and coming studs in say... Nurse and Reinhart + Seabrook is a lot better than having Nurse, Klefa and Reinhart all looking for minutes."
EdmontonOilers,3ci4sc,tsn123456789,15,Wed Jul 8 02:51:25 2015 UTC,"I really hope they don't start shipping out prospects for a 31yo looking for a 8M deal long term after next year. Besides, Nurse and Reinhart could very well start in the AHL (Nurse pretty much for sure, Reinhart is iffy). There's plenty of minutes to go around if we just sit Ference."
EdmontonOilers,3ci4sc,notsoyoungpadawan,5,Wed Jul 8 02:55:21 2015 UTC,"He's 30. And no offence but if I have to choose between Reinhart and Seabrook, I'm taking Seabrook all day everyday. We'd be trading for a guy who could easily give us another 4-5 years of great service (I'd even offer him a 6 year deal), and his leadership and experience will be more beneficial to this team than developing Reinhart. I mean, can you imagine how much Nurse and Klefbom's game would improve? Don't forget, he's also a RHD and scores 30-50 points a season. We actually need someone exactly like Seabrook in this team, but whether Hawks want to give him up is a different question altogether."
EdmontonOilers,3ci4sc,tsn123456789,9,Wed Jul 8 03:08:10 2015 UTC,"You missed my point. I never said anything about preferring Reinhart over Seabrook as a player. The question is, what happens if this guy wants an 8x8 or even a 7X7 like Phaneuf (I'm 100% sure he's getting more than Phaneuf)? He'll be 31 by the end of next year. Giving up assets and tying up our cap is going to kill us when all of our ELCs are up. By the time we're actually competitive he'll be on the decline with a large, immovable cap hit. Leadership and experience can be bought for a lot cheaper than Seabrook (see Justin Williams at 3.25x2), and if I have to overpay I overpay for young elite talent, not an aging one.  And the guy is still an elite shutdown defender but no longer an offensive force (can still chip in here and there), his career high is 48 points 5 years ago. In any case the Hawks are not moving him, we're better suited to not give up assets for him and wait and see in UFA."
EdmontonOilers,3ci4sc,notsoyoungpadawan,1 point,Wed Jul 8 03:17:30 2015 UTC,"There is absolutely no way he gets 8x8. 7x7 is also quite unrealistic considering his age, so I doubt that could happen either. A 6x6 or 6x7 contract is much more realistic, similar to Boychuk, but in Seabrook's case, because he'd be older when signing, the term could be shorter.  I'm talking about leadership and experience to our D core. And defencemen hit their prime at 30, so we'd have Seabrook for his best years. A defenceman's age should only be a factor if he is past 35.  He had 8 goals last season, and had 41 points in 2013-14 season, so again, I don't see how you can claim he's not an offensive threat.  Also, he'll be 31 next April, so in a year or 7 months into the season, which is still a pretty much full season."

EdmontonOilers,3cfka5,AsOneAce11,2,Tue Jul 7 15:28:13 2015 UTC,"Connie Mack:       Cornelius McGillicuddy, Sr. (December 22, 1862 – February 8, 1956), better known as Connie Mack, was an American professional baseball player, manager, and team owner. The longest-serving manager in Major League Baseball history, he holds records for wins (3,731), losses (3,948), and games managed (7,755), with his victory total being almost 1,000 more than any other manager.  Mack managed the Philadelphia Athletics for the club's first 50 seasons of play, starting in 1901, before retiring at age 87 following the 1950 season, and was at least part-owner from 1901 to 1954. He was the first manager to win the World Series three times, and is the only manager to win consecutive Series on separate occasions (1910–11, 1929–30); his five Series titles remain the third most by any manager, and his nine American League pennants rank second in league history. However, constant financial struggles forced repeated rebuilding of the roster, and Mack's teams also finished in last place 17 times. Mack was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1937.

EdmontonOilers,3cfpmd,ipooblood,13,Tue Jul 7 15:40:05 2015 UTC,I don't think that's a very good idea it's like the suggestion of moving Schultz to forward.  Instead of a defesneman with offensive potential you end up with a forward who's not good enough to be an NHL level forward.
EdmontonOilers,3cfpmd,haterbehatin,10,Tue Jul 7 15:59:38 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's pretty high-risk meh-reward"
EdmontonOilers,3cfpmd,Meowingtons-PhD,2,Tue Jul 7 16:19:57 2015 UTC,"There are only a handful of players who can make the transition.  Burns has done it well, as has Big Buff, but they both struggle in their own ways.  Strudwick use to do it for the Oilers, and I believe he (if not him, then someone else who had done the transition) commented on how much more stamina it takes to play the wing, because you have to basically skate back and forth up the sides of the ice from your own goal line to the other, sometimes multiple times in a shift.  Winger and D man are definitely different beasts."
EdmontonOilers,3cfpmd,DJ80,1 point,Tue Jul 7 17:39:55 2015 UTC,Toby Peterson used to play defense for the Oilers sometimes back when they were decimated by injuries but he was more of a fringe guy trying to do what was best for the team though.   The most notable one I know of is Wendel Clark moving from defense to left wing but I think he didn't play defense in the NHL at all he moved to wing right after he was drafted.
EdmontonOilers,3cfpmd,haterbehatin,10,Tue Jul 7 19:58:39 2015 UTC,It's not easy moving from D to forward. Instincts are different. Does laleggia have the hands and dekeing skills. Is his first step quick enough?  Not saying it's impossible but there's a reason it doesn't happen more often. I don't know Joeys playing style well/skills to know if he's got it in him.

EdmontonOilers,3cfpmd,Meowingtons-PhD,2,Wed Jul 8 00:39:37 2015 UTC,He dangled through a group of likely not even AHLers in a no hit game. Plus we're talking a sample size of 1 game.
EdmontonOilers,3cfpmd,Scottishstalion,7,Wed Jul 8 02:17:40 2015 UTC,"Laleggia might be small, but that's not going to hold him back one bit. He'll have a long, successful career in the NHL, and hopefully it's with the Oilers.   Love Nurse, love McDavid, but I think Laleggia will emerge as a huge piece of the puzzle on D. He'll be our Rafalski."
EdmontonOilers,3cfpmd,bigfatphony,2,Tue Jul 7 16:44:41 2015 UTC,"I don't know, man, he is really small and the Oilers play in the West - the Pacific nonetheless. I hope you're right, but have my doubts."
EdmontonOilers,3cfpmd,champion_dave,1 point,Tue Jul 7 22:11:12 2015 UTC,"Detroit played in the west when Rafalski was ripping it up too.  Jarred Spurgeon is one of Minny's best d-men at 5' 9"" (and that's being generous). Kris Russel and Sami Vatanen are both the same height and weight as Laleggia, both very effective top 4 defenders in the Pacific.  The thing that I see in Laleggia that is really unique is the maturity in his game and in his off ice attitude. He plays and sounds like he's a pro already, and he's only 23 years old.  I know I'm pretty high on the kid, but you don't really see the kind of game he plays in a late round prospect very often."
EdmontonOilers,3cfpmd,bigfatphony,1 point,Tue Jul 7 23:14:44 2015 UTC,Good points. I would be ecstatic if he could make the team at some point and contribute. That would be terrific scouting.

EdmontonOilers,3cfpmd,notsoyoungpadawan,5,Tue Jul 7 18:48:29 2015 UTC,"Dude seems like a pretty legit prospect.  Put up great numbers all four years in college, was a finalist for the Hobey Baker and is besties with RNH.

EdmontonOilers,3cfpmd,howler1994,3,Tue Jul 7 17:52:54 2015 UTC,He's bigger than Krug. He needs to get stronger but size isn't going to hold him back. He can be an offensive minded guy on the third pairing like Schultz is now.
EdmontonOilers,3cfpmd,tsn123456789,3,Tue Jul 7 17:40:07 2015 UTC,"It's definitely something to consider, but I think he should test the AHL as a defenseman first.

EdmontonOilers,3cfpmd,ClintonsDix,2,Tue Jul 7 17:47:27 2015 UTC,"It's not usually this kind of player that succeeds in that kind of move.

EdmontonOilers,3cdjux,shweet44722,9,Tue Jul 7 03:33:00 2015 UTC,"As if we weren't hype enough already... Holy shit is McDavid good. The puck looks like its glued to his stick when he handles it. He can make moves in such tight spaces and also has some killer instinct when it comes to finishing. Drai also looked amazing. Such phenomenal vision and passing ability. He makes the passes he makes look so easy. And Nurse was just a beast. Carries the puck well, has great speed and strength, and makes great first passes. Imagine him playing at full speed. He was playing at 50% tonight and was still crushing guys and making great plays. Can't wait to see him at the actual camp this year."
EdmontonOilers,3cdjux,Shottaz83,2,Tue Jul 7 02:10:59 2015 UTC,He gone have to do dat e'ry night in the bigs if he wants to break the team record 50 in 39

McDavid looking mad tidy and Drai looking great too!  They clearly weren't giving 100% but it was a fun time. Well worth staying awake for. 3am though so that'll be all for me tonight.  Was I right in seeing that the full team camp will also be streamed like this camp was? I have loved watching it so I will get in about it if it is!"

EdmontonOilers,3cd3da,Meowingtons-PhD,5,Mon Jul 6 23:44:46 2015 UTC,"http://imgur.com/a/9vgXQ  Those are some pictures of mine from the last few days.  It's hard to read into too much with the Billy Moores cup because it was 4 on 4 and everyone was pretty clearly not going 100% except for maybe the goalies. However, McDavid and Nurse looked absolutely terrific. Nurse looks and moves like an NHL player, and wasn't afraid to rough up the opposition a little bit.  It's the first time I had ever seen McDavid play a semi-competitive game, and he's so much FASTER than I thought. It seems kind of stupid to only realize that now, but wow. His speed really is on a different level, and seeing him in person really shows it off.  I thought that Draisaitl looked uninterested and almost bored for most of the game. He had that 1 powerful drive to the net and got a pretty assist, but then promptly gave it away to McDavid for his 2nd goal on the ensuing play. I'm not worried about it though, he probably just wanted the camp to be over after playing a really, really long season.  Caleb Jones looked decent, as well as Svoboda. There might actually be something there with him, but he's definitely a few years away.   If anyone has any questions, pls grill away."
EdmontonOilers,3cd3da,paul-mccartney,2,Tue Jul 7 04:58:35 2015 UTC,"Nurse looked awesome, he was the only guy throwing people around."

EdmontonOilers,3cd3da,edmontonmatty,1 point,Tue Jul 7 01:06:21 2015 UTC,"They don't seem like that similar of players to me. I haven't seen the nastiness to Nurse's game like Pronger had, Nurse is a much better skater but I don't think he has anywhere near the shot that Pronger had either."
EdmontonOilers,3cd3da,IGetComputersPuting,2,Tue Jul 7 01:10:54 2015 UTC,Ohhhh it's there. This guy is dropping people (big or small) on this game. He was literally the only guy hitting out there tonight.
EdmontonOilers,3cd3da,haterbehatin,1 point,Tue Jul 7 01:25:27 2015 UTC,"I'm not saying he's entirely not physical, but Pronger was nasty, just all over the ice vicious."
EdmontonOilers,3cd3da,dblkll,2,Tue Jul 7 02:55:00 2015 UTC,"Watching him play the way he was in a scrimmage, yeah he was being nasty."
EdmontonOilers,3cd3da,haterbehatin,3,Tue Jul 7 03:22:06 2015 UTC,"I don't think that nastiness pronger played with can exist in the nhl any more, maybe Nurse can become the nhl of today's pronger (a slightly less meaner player)"
EdmontonOilers,3cd3da,Arunatic5,1 point,Tue Jul 7 03:23:55 2015 UTC,"I think he can be a very good player, I just don't think Pronger is a very good comparison for play style.   If he becomes a guy who can play nearly 30 minutes a night though like Pronger did that would be amazing for the Oilers."
EdmontonOilers,3cd3da,areyouhappynowethan,2,Tue Jul 7 01:33:28 2015 UTC,"Yea I agree I doubt he can actually play like that, he'd be suspended all the time. I was making the comment based on him liking Pronger's game/wanting to shut down opponents like him"
EdmontonOilers,3cd3da,Icekommander,2,Tue Jul 7 01:40:35 2015 UTC,Ah fair enough.   Yeah if he can play anywhere close defensively to how he did against McDavid in the series with Erie and continue to jump into the play and create offense like he did with the Greyhounds he'll definitely be able to make an impact all over the ice.

EdmontonOilers,3ccm6m,YouJagaloon,26,Mon Jul 6 21:33:48 2015 UTC,I'm willing to take a chance on a goalie who did well in Russia in exchange for a guy who had an outside shot at being an ahler
EdmontonOilers,3ccm6m,oddspellingofPhreid,4,Mon Jul 6 21:37:34 2015 UTC,"He had good stats in the AHL as a 21/22 year old too. I think Chia won this deal simply because we've gone from possessing a nothing player to an NHL ready goalie, but I get the feeling it must be part of some other deal he's building towards."
EdmontonOilers,3ccm6m,notsoyoungpadawan,3,Mon Jul 6 21:48:24 2015 UTC,I'm guessing scrivens is gone either before the season starts or early on.
EdmontonOilers,3ccm6m,oddspellingofPhreid,11,Mon Jul 6 22:03:03 2015 UTC,"I'm not that high on Scrivens but a Talbot, Nilsson tandem is a bit risky.   Nilsson seems to have progressed well in the KHL so he might turn into something.   On the other hand it's possible that Nilsson never even signs with the Oilers."
EdmontonOilers,3ccm6m,haterbehatin,15,Mon Jul 6 22:04:43 2015 UTC,"My guess is he's here to light a fire under Ben at training camp. If he outplays Ben, then he's the new backup. Younger, and came off of an outstanding season and almost won a Gagarin Cup as well.  EDIT: Bonus highlight reel save"
EdmontonOilers,3ccm6m,DocDiggler,19,Mon Jul 6 22:19:31 2015 UTC,The Oilers also need to hire that video editor.
EdmontonOilers,3ccm6m,falsekoala,5,Mon Jul 6 22:32:51 2015 UTC,"Haha that video is pretty funny, but yeah, he could do well. His stats are quite good. Its hard to see us going into a season with 3 goalies, but its possible. Certainly makes things a bit more interesting now."
EdmontonOilers,3ccm6m,notsoyoungpadawan,3,Mon Jul 6 22:36:15 2015 UTC,"I looked into him a few weeks ago, I'm not sold on him. From what I hear his numbers are inflated (KHL being a goalie friendly league and all) and his teammate Garipov has a higher potential than he does. I thought there were better options in NA we could've pursued (Hellberg for example)."
EdmontonOilers,3ccm6m,tsn123456789,4,Mon Jul 6 22:37:35 2015 UTC,"He had the 2nd highest save% in the regular KHL season (#1 played 17 games less) and 5th highest in the playoffs. Goalie friendly league or not, that is impressive, especially for what we gave away to sign him."
EdmontonOilers,3ccm6m,notsoyoungpadawan,3,Mon Jul 6 22:46:48 2015 UTC,"Not saying it's a bad move, but just saying to temper expectation. I personally thought if Hellberg was worth a 6th round pick we could've nabbed him. It's not like Nilsson was Carey Price carrying his team, he was on a pretty stacked team on a bigger ice surface. Garipov also put up insane numbers (especially in 13-14)."
EdmontonOilers,3ccm6m,tsn123456789,4,Mon Jul 6 22:53:01 2015 UTC,"Garipov's numbers were 0.3 lower than Nilsson's in fewer games :)  And there was a reason Nashville traded Hellberg.. He's had 2 very mediocre seasons, so I'm not very sold on the argument that we should've picked up Hellberg instead."
EdmontonOilers,3ccm6m,notsoyoungpadawan,3,Mon Jul 6 22:57:07 2015 UTC,It would be cool if he was willing to fight for a spot in camp and accept a spot in Bakersfield battling with Brossoit if Scrivens beats him out.  That way if Talbot takes off like we all hope Scrivens could be dealt if Nilsson plays well in the AHL.
EdmontonOilers,3ccm6m,haterbehatin,3,Mon Jul 6 23:32:40 2015 UTC,"I'm not that high on Scrivens but a Talbot, Nilsson tandem is a bit risky.   Talbot/Scrivens was about equally risky, and $1.5 million more expensive, is probably the thinking here.   Chia is putting together a nice little pattern of replacing bit players with same-or-marginally-better equivalents with better contracts than the OBC handed out. Making the team more efficient per dollar spent is an excellent way to get better."
EdmontonOilers,3ccm6m,senj,2,Tue Jul 7 02:14:41 2015 UTC,That's assuming he can move out Scrivens without taking back money though and even then Scrivens has a much better track record in the NHL than Nilsson does at this point.   Nilsson might be better as soon as this season but that's not guaranteed by any means.   It's hard to say because previously Nilsson didn't want to play in the AHL but it would seem reasonable to go to camp with these three goaltenders.   He could've promised him a spot though and be planning to move out Scrivens.
EdmontonOilers,3ccm6m,haterbehatin,1 point,Tue Jul 7 02:23:28 2015 UTC,"and even then Scrivens has a much better track record in the NHL than Nilsson does at this point.   ehhh...  57 games last year and Scrivens finished below the Mendoza line. I tend to think the only thing his ""track record"" says is that he's not cut out for NHL play. And his contract is ludicrous, considering that.  Nilsson's numbers aren't noticeably better, but at least with him you're not paying top backup dollars for AHL quality."
EdmontonOilers,3ccm6m,senj,3,Tue Jul 7 21:24:09 2015 UTC,he already signed with edmonton
EdmontonOilers,3ccm6m,IAMA-CANADIAN-AMA,2,Tue Jul 7 00:25:29 2015 UTC,I'm surprised it was so quick unless they were able to talk to him and have it worked out that he'll sign.  I'm not sure what the tampering rules are in the case of unsigned guys like this although maybe they had it worked out with the Hawks to try and sign him and the trade was conditional on Nilsson being willing to sign.  The Hawks have no place or real interest in him as far as I can tell so it made sense to move him.
EdmontonOilers,3ccm6m,haterbehatin,14,Tue Jul 7 00:27:30 2015 UTC,UPDATE: The Oilers and Nilsson have agreed to terms on a one-year contract.
EdmontonOilers,3ccm6m,notsoyoungpadawan,9,Tue Jul 7 00:08:23 2015 UTC,"1 year, 1 way, $1M.   This is getting very interesting. If Scrivens isn't moved, I assume Nilsson has clause that lets him go back to the KHL if he loses the backup job."
EdmontonOilers,3ccm6m,notsoyoungpadawan,4,Tue Jul 7 00:16:02 2015 UTC,"That's a wonderful bridge contract. I think Scrivens will get moved, personally. Don't see why we would have offered Nilsson a contract if he wasn't going to stay in the NHL. Also, supposedly Nilsson was getting offered a lot of money to stay in the KHL but he had already decided to move to NHL this season."
EdmontonOilers,3ccm6m,bigfatphony,8,Tue Jul 7 00:28:27 2015 UTC,"An interesting deal.  Maybe it's in prep for a bigger move shipping Scrivs off somewhere?  Maybe they bring him in for camp to push up the competition level, see if he outplays Scrivs?   Maybe Nilsson just can't stand Russia anymore and wants to come back. Maybe the AHL in California is more appealing to him than Bridgeport, and he's there to be our new Richard Bachman?  Let's take a step back though...  How is it that in one off-season we went from having no defensive depth and no goalie depth, to not having enough spots for all our goalies and defencemen?"
EdmontonOilers,3ccm6m,But-Seriously-Though,6,Mon Jul 6 22:06:26 2015 UTC,"We should also limit the joy we take out of that last point and realize none of the goalies are proven starters (debatable point I know but ben is unproven and Talbot has never had that role longer than a month) and we still dont have a guy on D that is an undisputed top pair guy. We have some that might be that some day in Nurse and Klefbom, but as of now we dont."
EdmontonOilers,3ccm6m,bigfatphony,2,Mon Jul 6 22:10:44 2015 UTC,"True true. It's just odd, given how completely dry we've been for so many years. Like... Our top goalie prospect used to Tyler Bunz! And then... Ty Rimmer? I dunno."
EdmontonOilers,3ccm6m,bigfatphony,6,Mon Jul 6 22:14:21 2015 UTC,"Stauffer just tweeted ""....and of Nilsson is coming back to North America logic dictates it is for an NHL job""  Usually when Stauffer gets all hinty and enigmatic, there's something going on."
EdmontonOilers,3ccm6m,teddybadman,2,Mon Jul 6 22:44:03 2015 UTC,"idno, Stauffer also said we wouldn't be going after a big name Dman (then we signed sekera) and right before that said we wouldnt be trading for a goalie @ the draft (and then we traded for Talbot)"
EdmontonOilers,3ccm6m,haterbehatin,4,Tue Jul 7 03:04:28 2015 UTC,Looks like he played in the KHL last year and had a lot of success. Never did much in the Islanders system here in North America.  Wonder if he'll stay in Russia or be Brossoit's backup incase Laurikainen is a bust.   Profile
EdmontonOilers,3ccm6m,But-Seriously-Though,3,Mon Jul 6 21:37:55 2015 UTC,"He left originally because he didn't want to play in the AHL, seems like he wouldn't be a good fit to be fighting for time in the AHL."

EdmontonOilers,3ccm6m,haterbehatin,2,Mon Jul 6 22:54:50 2015 UTC,So if he originally left because he didnt want to play in the AHL is he being brought in to actually push for the NHL back up job? has he had a change of heart? or is this a contract dump to free roster space?

They used to have autograph sessions all the time. Me, my parents and my brothers would go every year. I walked up to the table and Janne had a huge smile on his face, and had a big black eye as well. I sat in his lap, he signed my jersey and my mom snapped the pic.

Can't ever think of why, maybe I liked how number 44 looked on his back, maybe because he was a left defense like I was in my novice days, but I loved the guy. Got my dad to buy a puck from the gift shop at Skyreach (weird to call it that now)during the skills competition and waited in that mile long line for him to sign it.

EdmontonOilers,3cbt2b,Arunatic5,7,Mon Jul 6 19:30:19 2015 UTC,"I think you're making a lot of generous assumptions (particularly in goal) that are compounding and your numbers are high as a result.  I don't think Talbot plays 60 games considering he's never started for more than a month before. We have no idea what his conditioning is like. I would say 50 is more reasonable, with Scrivens playing 30 and Brossoit playing 2. I also think a .920 sv% is generous for any goalie playing behind Ference, Schultz, and Nikitin. I would hope for a .915. Your estimate for Scriven's .910 is above his career average, but if we ignore last year's tire fire it's a reasonable guess.   Using these numbers (and assuming Brossoit gives up 6 goals in his 2 games):   Talbot: (1 - .915) * 29 * 50 = 123.  Scrivens: (1 - .910) * 29 * 30 = 78.  Brossoit: 6  I have us letting in 207, putting us in the top 10 Goals Against. Which still sounds like a generous estimate.   Goals for is fairly reasonable. I don't think it's unreasonable to suggest that swapping Roy/Arcobello with McDavid should net ~30 extra goals. That alone gets us in the ballpark of your estimate. Depending how Yak does and if the top 6 can stay healthy, we could see up to 40 more than last year.   So I'll say 207 against (although I don't like it) and 235 for. [+28 differential]"
EdmontonOilers,3cbt2b,YouJagaloon,1 point,Mon Jul 6 18:34:23 2015 UTC,"I don't think Talbot plays 60 games considering he's never started for more than a month before   Talbot played all but 1 games during the entire month of Feb and March for the Rangers, including 2 back to backs (3 back to backs total last season). In addition of those B2Bs and 2 in 3 nights, he played 3 in 5 nights 9 times over that stretch.   So I'll say 207 against (although I don't like it) and 235 for. [+28 differential]   I think that's pretty reasonable, and that still gets us into probable playoff territory.  EDIT: Also...   Your estimate for Scriven's .910 is above his career average, but if we ignore last year's tire fire it's a reasonable guess.   Scrivens in a backup role put up .915, .931, and .916 in the three previous seasons. I think .910 is actually pretty reasonable!"

EdmontonOilers,3cbt2b,tsn123456789,0,Tue Jul 7 01:34:34 2015 UTC,"This is where I really dislike analytics. You can't just put a team on paper, do a little additive and subtractive math, and predict the future. A big part of team sports is the team aspect. A team without any mental fortitude will cave in after they're down 2 goals. You flip out 3 or 4 of the right pieces and the attitude of the team can really change where they'll scrap and claw for those 2 goals deep in the third to get those extra points instead of just mailing it in and losing by 5.  Not that I think miracles will happen overnight, but the idea of ""making up a goal differential"" from last season when one third of the player personnel from last season is going to be changed, is absolutely rubbish to me."
EdmontonOilers,3cbt2b,McEirhead,2,Mon Jul 6 18:50:45 2015 UTC,"Not that I think miracles will happen overnight, but the idea of ""making up a goal differential"" from last season when one third of the player personnel from last season is going to be changed, is absolutely rubbish to me.   Well, clearly we are taking into account personell changes, particularly in the goaltending dept.  As for the idea that using GD is analytics, I can't disagree more. This is just basic math. Teams with a negative GD do not make the playoffs. Teams with a +GD of <10 do not make the playoffs normally. Every team outside of Anaheim and PITS had a GD of at least +20. No team with a GD of +20 or more missed the playoffs this year, and as far as I can tell, **no** team with a GD of >+20 has missed the playoffs in the past ten years.  So, if the Oilers can get to +10, they have a chance at playoffs. If they can get +20 or more, they are pretty much guaranteed playoffs. Nothing in sports is assured of course, but ten years of data is enough to give us pretty good certainty."
EdmontonOilers,3cbt2b,McEirhead,-1,Mon Jul 6 19:19:43 2015 UTC,At no point did I disagree that having a positive GD is a good metric for determining whether or not a team can make playoffs. I simply implied that predicting the GD for next season is absurd.
EdmontonOilers,3cbt2b,McEirhead,1 point,Mon Jul 6 19:27:28 2015 UTC,"Why do you say that?  Predicting forward Gs is simply a matter of taking previous totals and making an educated guess as to how they will perform this season.  Taking GA is primarily a factor of goaltending and defensive systems. As mentioned above in the links I posted, there is a very good argument to make that the biggest culprit on the Oilers last season was very very bad goaltending. Combined with terrible offensive numbers last season for most of the roster, a big turnaround is very possible. While the defensive corps was pretty bad, they actually only contributed to about 15GA over an average defensive NHL defensive corps. Projecting Talbot is the tricky part. If he puts up .920 like the good starter many have predicted he will be, the Oilers can make huge strides in GA. Remember that all our starting goaltenders last year had less than .900 SV%. That is just atrocious.   Now, given, suggesting that Talbot puts up .920 is somewhat bold, but not even close to outside the realm of possibility."
EdmontonOilers,3cbt2b,tsn123456789,1 point,Mon Jul 6 19:32:53 2015 UTC,"If you look at the advanced stats of goalies, you will also see that they can be victims of poor teams. Scrivens was not bad 2 years ago, but completely tanked last year after consecutive losing seasons. With that, I defer you to my original post about it being a team game."
EdmontonOilers,3cbt2b,stitzy1,1 point,Mon Jul 6 19:35:59 2015 UTC,"Actually, if you look at the advanced stats of goalies, they remain remarkably consistent from team to team within a set range. Team effects have little demonstrable effect on a goalie's SV% (particularly EVSV%). They do have an impact on GAA and GA though, as more shots=more goals. The Oilers at 29 shots against were pretty near to league average last season, and I don't see how that will get much better or worse this year.   The only question is not team effects, but to what extent Talbot can be a starter. His underlying stats are excellent, and for people who have dug, he is very reminiscent of Cory Schneider before he became a full-time starter. That is not a gaurantee at all, but him putting up .920 wouldn't have even put him in the top ten starters this season. The GA is simply so massive for the Oilers because our goalies were that bad last year."

EdmontonOilers,3c88l3,LiamMcFearson,16,Sun Jul 5 20:42:45 2015 UTC,"Lander - I'm really looking forward to seeing what he can do in a full time role. McLellan will do wonders for his game like Nelson, and he'll have a breakout season this year. He's not going to put up a ton of points, but he has the ability to score well for a 3rd/4th liner and is also very responsible in his own zone and on the dot. He's coming into this season with a lot more confidence than seasons past, and that should be great for him.  Draisaitl - The same goes for him as well, he's coming into camp extremely confident right now. Him, McDavid and Nurse we're clearly ahead of all the other prospects at the rookie orientation camp, and he's going to be pushing hard for a spot on the team. Right now he's not sure where he fits, but he's said he's willing to move to the wing, as long as he plays in the NHL. Thats his main goal. He doesn't care where he plays, as long as he helps the team win and plays in the big leagues. I'm very curious to see what he can do with McLellan. We need to all remember that the only coach he's played for under us was Dallas Eakins. Say what you will about Eakins, but pretty much every player on the team improved when he left and Nelson came in, and I expect the same to happen with McLellan. Drai was also forced into a spot he was not ready for at the time, and this time around he'll be playing more sheltered minutes against weaker opponents with Nuge and McDavid taking top line minutes. This will be a breakout year for him if he makes the team.   Nurse - Nurse is coming into camp in the best shape of his life. He was playing 30+ minutes a night in the playoffs, and played the best hockey of his career. His speed and strength on the puck is impressive, and he has the ability to shut down some of the best players in the league. He'll be pushing extremely hard for a spot on the team, and I have a feeling he might just make it. On top of all of his skills on the ice, his commitment and hard work off the ice is even more impressive. The biggest thing with Nurse is his compete on the ice. He plays physical all the time and he never gives his guy any space. He frustrates people, is a natural leader and sticks up for his teammates whenever something goes down."
EdmontonOilers,3c88l3,Shottaz83,3,Sun Jul 5 21:06:48 2015 UTC,"I don't expect Draisaitl or Nurse to make the Oilers to start the season.  I actually don't want Draisaitl to make the roster because I feel he'd be better served playing in Bakersfield and sticking in the middle, he still needs work on parts of his game and the AHL would be a great place for him to learn.   Nurse I think might deserve to be an Oiler but is going to be blocked by all the garbage at the bottom of the Oilers defense, Ference, Nikitin, Gryba.   Nurse will be doubly blocked if management is still set on Reinhart making the opening night roster although I could see that changing with the addition of Sekera and I would argue it would be better for both he and Nurse to play 20 minutes a night in Bakersfield to start the season.   With the bigger names blocked from the roster I could see Pitlick making an impact as a decent bottom 6 guy provided he's healthy. He brings exactly what the Oilers need to the bottom 6 with his size and skating ability.   That said he could also easily end up on waivers depending on how TMAC views him."

EdmontonOilers,3c88l3,notsoyoungpadawan,-6,Mon Jul 6 00:19:59 2015 UTC,"Only in the minds of Oiler fans (im one) we over rate most of our players, Petry being another one of them."
EdmontonOilers,3c88l3,koho_66,13,Mon Jul 6 01:26:37 2015 UTC,If you think Petry was overrated by Oilers fans then how do you justify Habs paying him $33m?
EdmontonOilers,3c88l3,notsoyoungpadawan,3,Mon Jul 6 01:49:39 2015 UTC,"Well, I can't speak for the other guy, but my impression is that people think Petry is over paid at 33$. I do however not agree with his statements. Lander did well enough to be a part of our roster and I have no doubts that he will be."
EdmontonOilers,3c88l3,Samegeir,10,Mon Jul 6 12:24:07 2015 UTC,"Lol what? Lander is built for a heavier game. He isn't the stereotypical ""skilled European"" who only plays on the outside and relies on a wicked shot to thrive. Lander was drafted to play a 3rd line centre role and has excellent leadership qualities, as evidenced by his captain role in OKC for 3 seasons."
EdmontonOilers,3c88l3,AllisGreat,7,Mon Jul 6 00:35:48 2015 UTC,Heavier game doesn't mean hitting more. It means being more assertive with the puck. You don't have to hit more to be successful in the NHL. Case in point: Chicago. Out hit nearly every series but they're have the 3 cup in 6 years.
EdmontonOilers,3c7lyb,Shottaz83,22,Sun Jul 5 17:22:56 2015 UTC,We probably won't host one soon but we'll probably participate in one as the visiting team against Montreal or Toronto. More likely we get the all-star game in 2017 or 18 to show off the new arena.
EdmontonOilers,3c7lyb,envague,6,Sun Jul 5 17:39:48 2015 UTC,Ya the unwritten rule seems to be that teams get the ASG within three years of a new arena. Are we the only club with a new rink next year?

EdmontonOilers,3c7lyb,bigfatphony,12,Sun Jul 5 18:35:28 2015 UTC,The one in Vancouver failed because it wasn't even an outdoor game as the roof was closed. It was basically an indoor hockey game in a bigger arena with worse sightlines  more expensive tickets and zero atmosphere.   The best thing to come out of that game was the goalie controversy of Tortorella starting Lack over Luongo. It basically ruined the rest of their season.

EdmontonOilers,3c63w1,Icekommander,5,Sun Jul 5 06:02:26 2015 UTC,"Great resource and links compilation. I have to say though that I have no idea what PDO is after reading its description. That being said, thanks for putting in the work."
EdmontonOilers,3c63w1,Icekommander,4,Sun Jul 5 05:02:47 2015 UTC,"Sorry! I'm rather crappy at explaining stuff.  PDO basically tries to account for luck. I'll try for an analogy of some sort.....  Okay, so let's say you're standing in the hashmarks facing a net with a goalie and you have 100 pucks. There's 3 possibilities (in theory). You either miss the net entirely, the goalie stops the puck, or you score. Let's say the average is 50 goals for 100 shots. You're not necessarily going to get 50 goals, you may get more, or less, but an average (or at least a non-skewed bell curve average) dictates that if you shoot enough pucks, you'll go back towards the mean eventually (50%). You may be higher, or lower, but you'll be around there eventually.  It's the same thing with PDO. For PDO, you add sv% and sh%, both of which should average around 100 (or 1.00 if you're using decimals). A team above that likely either has fantastic goaltending, or really, really high team shooting percentages. That stat won't necessarily stay that high, and vice versa for a team below. Since stats are often theoretical, or saying what ""should"" happen, a team isn't necessarily going to descend or ascend back to 1.00. Like the Oilers from this past season. We had terrible sv%, worst in the league by quite a  high margin, but higher sh% under Eakins, so our PDO shouldn't have been terrible...but because our sv% was so low, our PDO got dragged down with it.  I think I just repeated myself like 4 times over and I really hope I didn't confuse you further. It's almost guaranteed someone has a better explanation than I do...remind me not be a teacher.  Edit: Also, it's my pleasure! I just hope the links are useful to other people as well."
EdmontonOilers,3c63w1,tsn123456789,2,Sun Jul 5 05:11:23 2015 UTC,"I don't think viewing PDO as luck is really the right way to go. The assumption behind that is that every single team is the same; same players, same goaltending, same playing style etc so theoretically they should all perform equally given a large enough sample size.  However, this isn't true, it's quite possible that a certain playing style, roster etc. will ""peak"" at a specific PDO under or over 1 and remain there. If you have a team full of 4th liners and an AHL goalie, your PDO will probably be bad, vice versa with a team of all stars + Price. Hard to imagine that these two teams with large enough sample size will perform equally, or else star players would be useless."
EdmontonOilers,3c63w1,Icekommander,3,Sun Jul 5 05:17:10 2015 UTC,"To be honest, got the ""luck"" description of the stat from this.  That's true, but a high enough sample size, in theory, solves all problems (like you said). Thing is, PDO isn't necessarily useful for evaluating a team, but rather evaluating where at team may go. A team with an abnormally high PDO can be predicted to regress towards the mean...but then again that can also be evaluated by simply looking at the sh% of sv% and seeing how high above the league average it is. So yeah, I'd have to agree that luck isn't really the best way to describe it, but I'd more say it's a predictive stat."
EdmontonOilers,3c63w1,tsn123456789,2,Sun Jul 5 05:25:17 2015 UTC,"The ""luck"" aspect of PDO comes from looking at small samples relative to larger ones. You'll notice that the lock-out season had the most extreme PDO values (1.032 at the top, 0.965 at the bottom) -- over the course of an 82 game season no team has finished further than 0.03 away from 1. However, in something like a 4-0 shut out a team could potentially have something like a 1.15 PDO. Thus over a smaller sample (say ten games) if a team has a PDO of something like 1.05 we know either their goalies or their shooters are performing at an unsustainable level (and are thus 'lucky').  It isn't really a predictive stat, because you can't predict when the goalies and shooters will start performing better, you just have pretty good evidence that it will eventually."
EdmontonOilers,3c63w1,Icekommander,2,Sun Jul 5 05:39:48 2015 UTC,"Well, then it's predictive in the sense that you know numbers aren't sustainable.....which can be said a number of stats. Hmm.  So realistically then...PDO doesn't have as much as value as it's credited for."
EdmontonOilers,3c63w1,tsn123456789,1 point,Sun Jul 5 05:57:11 2015 UTC,"Well, on a practical level it isn't terribly useful to know how lucky your team has been. At best, PDO tells you that you've had some exceptional results, and it's pretty hard to plan around that."
EdmontonOilers,3c63w1,drawnfawn,0,Sun Jul 5 06:13:31 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't even say it's a predictive stat. Our PDO was horrible the whole year while logic dictates that it should regress towards 1. The issue is people assume that teams will regress towards 1.0. Why not .9? 1.1? What exactly is too high and too low? Who knows maybe with the personnel/coaching/goaltending that the actual PDO of a team is maybe at 1.05 instead of 1. Typically we're not going to see .800sv% and 1% shooting percentage, most teams have a reasonable PDO not equal to 1, and it's really hard to predict from that point which way they'll trend."
EdmontonOilers,3c63w1,tsn123456789,5,Sun Jul 5 05:40:14 2015 UTC,"Because no team has finished more than 0.03 away from 1 in as far back as I've been able to find, except in the lockout year (when the furthest away was 0.035). While each team probably has a ""true"" value, that value at most is going to be something like 1.01, while PDO can vary by much more than that on a season by season basis. Continuing your example, our PDO this year was a tied for league worst 0.971, but last year it was 0.991 and the two seasons before that it was above 1. If you expand the sample beyond this season that regression does occur. Maybe not exactly to 1 but certainly closer than 0.971."
EdmontonOilers,3c63w1,Oilfan9911,2,Sun Jul 5 05:55:48 2015 UTC,"I wasn't pointing to specific numbers, just a general abstract view. I think you're really understating how important that 0.03 separation is, given the low variance of PDO (which is another reason why I don't find it useful but that's a different convo). In your example above, the 0.971 figure can be take to be our ""true"" PDO; is there any basis to think that if we used the same roster/coach that we're going to get a significant deviation from that value? If we had a stretch of game where our PDO was say 0.98 (and no other information) we would think that we were unlucky and should perform even better (towards 1) when in reality our true PDO is even lower at 0.971. This is what I was getting at, your PDO to date really doesn't say very much to predict what your PDO in the future may be. Sometimes PDO hold steady around a certain value not equal to 1.0."
EdmontonOilers,3c63w1,tsn123456789,3,Sun Jul 5 06:04:37 2015 UTC,"If you were consistently at 0.03 below league average, sure that would be a problem. But those are the extreme outer markers, not where teams finish with any sort of consistancy. And how exactly are you coming to the conclusion that PDO is low variance? To continue to use us as the example, we've been tied for 30th, 24th, 6th, and 10th in the league for PDO over the past four seasons. This is much greater variance than our positions in the standings (28th, 28th, 24th, 29th).   Also, we do have evidence that our 0.971 is a statistical aberration. The first is that teams do strongly correlate near one. Not exactly one, sure, but closer than 0.971. The second is that averaging this season with last season we get 0.981. The rosters aren't exactly the same, but they're as close as you can get in a practical scenario. The third is that most of our PDO loss came from goaltending. Both Scrivens and Fasth posted numbers well below their career averages (even after this season both are at ~0.905 SV%). If we replayed the season and they posted numbers at their career averages we'd already see something like a 0.015 increase in PDO, and that's still bottom of the league goal tending that probably underestimates their true value."

This is much greater variance than our positions in the standings (28th, 28th, 24th, 29th).   I wasn't referring to low variance for a team specific historical trend. I'm talking about the league as a whole from year to year, in general there's a second decimal variation from 1.0. When you say something like 0.99 is very close to 1, well the difference between a 0.99 and 1.01 this year is Florida/Buffalo to playoff teams. Because PDO numbers for each team is not so spread out from 1.0 (numerically), every little decimal counts quite a bit (another reason I don't like this stat). Are you saying that every team with a 0.99 PDO is just unlucky? That they should be playoff teams who only have a PDO slightly above 1 (so numerically they are relatively close)? I don't feel that these ""small"" jumps in PDO is a result of statistical fluctuation, if that was the case then we should have fluctuated ourselves into a playoff spot once in the last 10 years.   Also, we do have evidence that our 0.971 is a statistical aberration. The first is that teams do strongly correlate near one. Not exactly one, sure, but closer than 0.971.

Here's the problem, you're looking at the numbers in a vacuum. If you bring up a Junior team to the NHL, and they post a bad PDO, is that statistical abberration? Do you feel last year's Oiler team underperformed per PDO or did they perform right where they should've been, just that they were that bad. As far as career SV%, I don't feel career to date is an accurate indicator of current ability, nor is SV% an individual stat. You can call it an off year, but our defense certainly didn't help that number, and I don't think even if we played 1000 games that number is going up, which is what PDO suggests.   If we replayed the season and they posted numbers at their career averages we'd already see something like a 0.015 increase in PDO, and that's still bottom of the league goal tending that probably underestimates their true value.   We can say this for a bunch of guys. If Yak/Hall/Ebs etc. scored a few more goals closer to their career shooting percentages our PDO should go up too. The assumption you have is that our performance was an anomaly because you are using past performance to project future performance when there's so many moving parts. Just because a team had so and so PDO in the past few years doesn't mean anything going forward; extrapolation like that is dangerous."
EdmontonOilers,3c63w1,tsn123456789,2,Sun Jul 5 06:52:36 2015 UTC,"Here's the problem, you're looking at the numbers in a vacuum. If you bring up a Junior team to the NHL, and they post a bad PDO, is that statistical abberration?   That is where the value of PDO comes from, you aren't playing junior teams. The base assumption is that the talent is even enough (throughout 30 teams) that players can still bury the chances that they generate and the goalies are talented enough to stop most of the chances. So if a team was to post a high or low PDO they would need to have a talent level a lot higher than the rest of the league. IIRC the last team with a high PDO that was sustained over a large sample size was the 83-88 Oilers. I think we can agree that those teams had a talent level higher in comparison to the rest of the league."
EdmontonOilers,3c63w1,mkwong,3,Sun Jul 5 08:58:11 2015 UTC,"Well, I mean again it's a theory. The law of averages dictates that teams will should regress towards 1, and the league should be 1, but not every team will be at 1 and the average may not even necessarily be 1. Just like how a sample size of 30+ should, in theory, mimic a populations' data results in a study, but won't necessarily do so.  IceKommander made some good points too. At this point I think I'd leaning towards PDO basically being more or less useless, with the exception of extreme cases as mentioned by jagaloon."
EdmontonOilers,3c63w1,YouJagaloon,2,Sun Jul 5 06:01:02 2015 UTC,"Yes, the basis of that 1.0 number comes from the fact that as a whole, the league shooting percentage and the league save percentage will always equal 1 and from that basis assumes every team is equal, when this isn't true. Each team will regress towards a different number whose sum is 1, but we dont know what this number is for each team. I agree in extreme cases this is probably useful but every once in a while there's a team like CGY who blows all of these adv. stats out of the water."
EdmontonOilers,3c63w1,notsoyoungpadawan,3,Sun Jul 5 06:10:17 2015 UTC,"You're off base. Think of it as running hot or running cold. As an example, we know that a coin flip is 50-50 between heads and tails. If in a string of coin flips 9/10 were heads, we would expect the next 10 flips to feature more tails and eventually regress to the mean.   So apply it to hockey. Shooting percentage typically averages out to 8.5%, save percentage 91.5% ... Higher or lower, it will eventually regress to the mean."
EdmontonOilers,3c63w1,ClintonsDix,1 point,Sun Jul 5 05:44:48 2015 UTC,"Again it goes back to my first point. The 1.0 number assumes every team is the same, roster, goaltending, coaching etc. This is not the case. Bring up an ECHL team to the NHL, they're going to have a terrible PDO, are you going to tell me that it's from luck? That they'll regress towards 1.0? My point is that the expected PDO of a team over large sample is not necessarily 1.0. They might regress but the regression point isn't necessarily 1.0. If this was true then it implies the quality of your roster doesn't matter, you can count on luck to push you to an average team."
EdmontonOilers,3c63w1,Dr_Marxist,1 point,Sun Jul 5 05:48:26 2015 UTC,"Again, shooting percentage is not repeatable. It bounces up and down during the course of a season, year over year. This is true if a player is Sidney Crosby or Zack Stortini. This is true for teams on the whole regardless of where in the standings a team finishes. Yes, some players will naturally have a higher shooting percentage than others, but everything will revert to average and you can tell pretty easily if they're running hot and cold.   The only thing that will give PDO a bump that's sustainable is year after year elite goaltending. Take a look at the goalie save percentage leaders this year, then go to last year, and the year before ... You'll see tons of variation. Goalies run hot and cold just like skaters (see Dubnyk, Devan).   So where does talent, roster composition, coaching, etc, come in? Driving possession. Talented teams and players possess the puck more and generate more chances on net which cancels luck out to a large degree, but not entirely (think Scrivens stealing that game against SJ two years ago)."
EdmontonOilers,3c63w1,defeatedbird,1 point,Sun Jul 5 14:15:22 2015 UTC,"I think we're basically saying the same thing. However, I wouldn't necessarily say that historical figures for a player is necessarily an accurate indication. Take a look at Foglino this year, he had sustained double his previous career average for shooting percentage for the past two years. Steen on the other hand regressed after one hot year. People said the same about the Flames and they've sustained their ""unsustainable"" play for a year and two rounds. My belief is that treating players like a statistical object is not always accurate; who knows maybe a guy just worked really hard and improved his game, that his new shooting percentage isn't because he's getting lucky. Maybe the system in place drives a higher team shooting percentage.  My point is that PDO really doesn't tell us much; if a guy is shooting ridiculously hot then PDO says ""chances are, he will regress"", but we're not 100% sure if it will (because maybe the guy actually improved) and it doesnt give us timeframe for when it will happen. It doesn't take a genius to draw this conclusion.    So where does talent, roster composition, coaching, etc, come in? Driving possession. Talented teams and players possess the puck more and generate more chances on net which cancels luck out to a large degree, but not entirely (think Scrivens stealing that game against SJ two years ago).   And in turn this affects PDO so they're not independent. The other issue is the current possession numbers don't always reflect the quality of play on the ice."

But I don't think we should have any reason (for the moment) to doubt Chia. He's already done way fucking more than any of our ex-GMs in the last 8 years and he's has had a very decorated career, so I'm pretty sure he knows what he's doing."

EdmontonOilers,3c4v4y,MolotovBeta,14,Sat Jul 4 22:11:19 2015 UTC,"I'll put it this way, I'm not concerned about the direction of the team with Dellow in management as he is now. I think that the advanced stats guys belong under the management tree structure, and not in coaching. Management works for procurement, which is what I see him doing, but the coaching staff sets lines and the teams day to day which if the teams goal is only to get a high Corsi and sets lines to maximize that, then chemistry and other important things things fall to the wayside.   I'm not saying that that is what happened with Eakins, because Nelson didn't do a whole lot to the lines, what I'm saying is I didn't understand what his role would have been while Eakins was here, because if it was just post-game reports he would have been under valued. I mean he was pretty much doing that for free on his website."
EdmontonOilers,3c4v4y,9Bains,5,Sat Jul 4 21:24:55 2015 UTC,"I think he may have been advising on breakouts, increasing PP shot attempts, etc. I completely agree with you, having Dellow advise on coaching didn't make much sense."
EdmontonOilers,3c4v4y,answerphoned1d6,2,Sat Jul 4 21:56:20 2015 UTC,"well then I hope he took a pay cut for his new position, because he wasn't very good in that role."
EdmontonOilers,3c4v4y,9Bains,8,Sat Jul 4 23:03:53 2015 UTC,"Yes and no. He's not an AGM or anything, so we can't know how much say he has in anything. For all we know he could've vehemently argued against one of these moves and the Chia/MacT/Howson (sp?) team could've overruled him. So while I think it's a good thing that he gets a voice in the management, i still wonder how much they value his input or rely on the eye test."
EdmontonOilers,3c4v4y,jkbrodie,5,Sat Jul 4 22:24:51 2015 UTC,I am not sure how much input he has. I know he would have never thought the Marincin and Gryba trades where a good idea. I would guess he would also push to get Franson and dump Schultz and Nikitin.

EdmontonOilers,3c4v4y,ghztew,4,Sun Jul 5 05:47:05 2015 UTC,"No, it doesn't.  Dellow provides some value, but I find that he and many of his followers are dogmatic on the idea of shots and shot attempts to a counter-productive degree.  The refusal on his part and some of his supporters like Lowetide or especially Woodguy to see that there is in fact a significant difference between shots and scoring chances is really frustrating.  They say ""Oh yeah, sure, but there's an incredibly strong correlation between shots and scoring chances"" or ""In the long run, over several seasons it evens out"", which misses the point.  I can point to no better example than the Oilers before, during, and after Dallas Eakins to explain that a shot may be correlated with a scoring chance - but only so long as people aren't shooting for the sake of a shot.  The very moment that coaches start preaching Corsi rather than hockey, or that players start to feel they're being judged by Corsi rather than on-ice results, the value of those statistics becomes skewed.  With Dallas Eakins, for example, he markedly improved Corsi over Ralph Krueger but the results on the ice fell off.  Way off.  We allowed fewer shots (a good thing) and we made more shots on net (also a good thing), but the quality of chances against us improved and so did their number.  So, too, the quality of shots the Oilers took and the number of quality shots they attempted dropped.  Now in a Corsi world, we were just ""waiting"" for on-ice results to catch up with the Corsi number, because there was the underlying assumption that the horrible goals-for/goals-against was a statistical anomaly since the higher-event shots on net/shots against which was highly correlated with scoring was stating that the Oilers were better.  However, the steadfast refusal to acknowledge that the quality of chances for and against had changed in an attempt to improve the correlative but not causative metric (shots) meant that the results stayed shit for one and a half seasons.  Suddenly, Todd Nelson goes in behind the bench and the Oilers start playing normal hockey - they're getting outshot like a bad team does, but they're winning more games because despite being worse than average, they were still much better than how they had performed under Eakins.  Even with the loss of Petry and without Hall, Nelson posted a better record than Eakins had.  Tyler is so stubborn that I'm not sure he fully realizes all this.  He's a really, really smart kid but the way his disciples (Spoiler, speeds, and especially Woodguy) talk, it's clear that at least they aren't grasping it.  Lowetide remains tactfully quiet and evasive but he's never - to the best of my knowledge - accepted that the improved Corsi % under Eakins was not just masking but the cause of bad hockey.  Tyler himself remains quiet and doesn't post much evaluative stuff, even under his new pseudonym."

None of them would argue that simply out-corsi-ing your opponents is a way to win. All they would argue is that corsi is a predictive stat that correlates with winning.

With Dallas Eakins, for example, he markedly improved Corsi over Ralph Krueger but the results on the ice fell off. Way off.

Lowetide and Woodguy in particular kept mentioning how it was a good sign, how results will catch up with the Corsi trend, and later that they only need a goalie.  It was a case of blame everything, but don't acknowledge that the team and players are chasing Corsi rather than playing hockey.  This continued even as Oilers scoring went down, and reliable forwards like Eberle and then, later, Hall began slumping.  First defence and then scoring started trending away from the Corsi prediction because as we all know, correlation is not causation.   And those bloggers you called out agree with that, and even suggest that Eakins's efforts to improve Corsi actually hurt the team.   I do believe I still hear otherwise.  LT will still comment about how ""Well, for all his faults, Dallas Eakins did improve shot differential"".  He'll do it on the radio, at least once a week.  Well, maybe once every two weeks.  If you can find a Woodguy post where he ever admits he's wrong on anything, that'll be a world first.   There isn't really anything at all to this statement: I challenge you to back it up. As far as I can tell, what actually happened is we had historically bad goaltending - again.   To which I reply with your own comment:   There are of course a hundred other variables that are difficult or impossible to measure, at the moment.   Nobody is measuring the quality of the chances because it's subjective.  However, it doesn't take even an experienced hockey eye to contrast the disaster that was The SwarmTM and its subsequent iterations, or notice the instant and immediate improvement in scoring by players like Jordan Eberle, Nail Yakupov and RNH upon Eakins' departure.  Shot differential suddenly was down to -6 or -7 per game and yet the team started winning a bit.  Even their worst slump of the Nelson era - a 7-game slide, happened after the trade of Petry and, IIRC, with Hall out.  This sounds bad, until you realize that Eakins won 1 of 15.  In the same season, the short one, the one where he got fired.  In the previous season he'd won 4 of his opening 21, and then managed to find another stretch where he won only another 4 of 21.  I find it somewhat interesting that people who see correlations everywhere can't quite see the one where in 1.5 seasons of Dallas Eakins we had ""historically bad goaltending"".  Was it bad after Eakins?  Sure, but I'm willing to say that a great part of that was the loss of our #1 defenceman (who would be at best a #3 on a contender), and the damage already done to the confidence of our goalies.  I will be very surprised if Scrivens doesn't post a .910 SP next season."

After investigation, posters like Woodguy found the truth: Eakins was making sacrifices to win the Corsi battle that were detrimental to over-all results.   Well then, why ask me to source it? Apparently your resources are better than mine.   Lots of work is being done to measure the scoring areas thanks to the technology increases in the last 3 years. In fact, it is one of the key areas of analysis used to identify just how good Price was this year (he faced more high-danger scoring chances than any other tender, and it wasn't close). But for the record, that doesn't make Eakins look worse, but better. His team actually reduced the number of high-danger scoring chances against compared to Nelson's team. But the sv% was actually laughable. Our goalies let in more soft goals from the hashmarks out than any other team, and it wasn't close."
EdmontonOilers,3c4v4y,Spoonfeedme,2,Sun Jul 5 16:03:13 2015 UTC,"Very possibly true. What's your point exactly?

Players and coaches - especially Eakins - were not blind to Corsi. This affected their play, and in Eakins case he actively coached it   So what we saw is an artificial improvement in Corsi.  The Oilers improved their shot totals in the belief that Corsi is causative rather than correlative.  Normally, of course, more shots taken and fewer allowed is better.  Except when the quality of shots taken drops in order to increase their quantity, and the quality of opposing shots permitted increases.   Two year old article when Corsi was just developing?

After investigation, posters like Woodguy found the truth: Eakins was making sacrifices to win the Corsi battle that were detrimental to over-all results.   I believe those improved Corsi numbers coincided with a 1-for-15 effort that sealed his career with the Oilers.  The entire season's numbers came with an Oilers record that was inexplicably worse than it had been the year before.  I'm sure Woodguy eventually found the evidence, but I also know that it took a kick in the teeth from 110 games of disaster and arguments with posters who are skeptical about Corsi.  Hey, remember how we were discussing how bad the goaltenders were?  How about that Dubnyk bum? :)"
EdmontonOilers,3c4v4y,defeatedbird,0,Sun Jul 5 16:36:32 2015 UTC,"So what we saw is an artificial improvement in Corsi. The Oilers improved their shot totals in the belief that Corsi is causative rather than correlative. Normally, of course, more shots taken and fewer allowed is better. Except when the quality of shots taken drops in order to increase their quantity, and the quality of opposing shots permitted increases.   But there is no actual evidence that the quality of shots that Edmonton faced for most of the season was all that bad. This is the opposite but equally absurd argument that Colorado fans used last off-season. The reality is not that quality of shots Edmonton faced were terrible (the high danger sv% of our goalies was actually not bad either), but that our goalies couldn't stop a beachball in general. The same way that Varly was outstanding in 2013/2014; despite the Avs fans saying it was because they limited 'shot quality' the reality is that their goalie was just hot as hell.   Corsi is a predictive stat, but it still is using very limited information, and everyone involved in the analytics movement knows that. The interesting thing is that, despite your claims to the contrary, the fact that results did not match with the Corsi in 2014/2015 led to the deeper investigation of Eakins's strategy that revealed the problem: too many shots taken from bad places. It's the same reveal that saw why FO% increases were actually costing the Oilers wins. Indeed, that seems to have been Eakins's biggest problem; focusing on a few important stats (conventional or otherwise) and trying to pump them up without actually working on the fundimentals that lead other teams to excell. It is, in a way, like prepping for a test. Sure, you will do good on the test, but the actual progress and learning you make will not be great.   Advanced stats were well under way two years ago. Come now, we were talking Corsi in 2010-2011. Not just Corsi, but CorsiRel, ZoneStarts, etc. Random link from then: http://lowetide.ca/2011/05/09/zack-stortini-10-11-too-much-of-nothing/   I meant the team Corsi under Eakins.   True. And how's that Dallas Eakins system work out? Did they forget how to play it for the next 86 games?   Okay, but WG didn't have a crystal ball, so that's a pretty fucking weak complaint.    I asked you to look at the Home numbers. Our Home record wasn't much better.   Corsi in 2013/2014 was bad. Bad bad bad. Our team was bad. Bad bad bad. Articles from 2013/2014 aren't a good place to go. 2014/2015 has quite a few articles from LT that talk about Corsi improving but results on ice not. As the year went on, this led to the investigation by several posters to find out why. And it seems they did.   I believe those improved Corsi numbers coincided with a 1-for-15 effort that sealed his career with the Oilers. The entire season's numbers came with an Oilers record that was inexplicably worse than it had been the year before.   And historically bad goaltending. Historically bad.   I'm sure Woodguy eventually found the evidence, but I also know that it took a kick in the teeth from 110 games of disaster and arguments with posters who are skeptical about Corsi.   No it didn't. The reason the evidence was found was precisely because of sustained belief in the predictive power of Corsi over the long term.   Hey, remember how we were discussing how bad the goaltenders were? How about that Dubnyk bum? :)   Dubnyk was bad for us. Did you watch him play? Just because he improved after a year of hard-work to fix his game doesn't mean he wasn't terrible for us."

Sorry for quoting out of order, but these are related.  I don't see how Dubnyk goes from a career .915-920 SP before Eakins, to terrible under Eakins, then to Vezina finalist the season after he leaves, and this isn't somehow related to Dallas Eakins and what he did to the Oilers.  I have no doubt that Dubnyk worked extra hard in the offseason, but I also really doubt that it was entirely his fault that the Oilers sucked with Eakins.  Just like it wasn't Scrivens' or Fasth's fault this season.  Indeed I look forward to seeing Scrivens next season so we can put this issue at rest, and my bet is that Scrivens gets back to .915 or so and that will settle the Eakins Effect.  I disagree with your assessment that the quality of shots the Oilers faced weren't tough.  They were.  The Oilers were mind-bogglingly awful in 2013-2014 under the Swarm and slightly better in 2014-2015.  Analyst after analyst didn't just comment on the Oilers' defensive breakdowns, they made fun of them in a way that would be unprofessional if it would have been any other team.  All you have to do is search for ""oilers defense"" in Google, go to images, and then the first two rows are more or less unique images of the most shit-for-brains breakdowns, all entirely under Eakins.   Okay, but WG didn't have a crystal ball, so that's a pretty fucking weak complaint.   He didn't need a crystal ball.  He needed to get a bigger sample size.  For a stats guy he sure loves to find something in a 3-10 game stretch and make a bold proclamation about it.  And God forbid you criticize it and get into an argument with him, because then he'll dig up 20 boring numbers about that stretch, 10 iffy comparables, plant his flag on that hill and fight to the death on it.  That's the most frustrating thing about that entire group of key Oilers fan thinkers.  Calgary makes the playoffs?  PDO!  PDO!  PDO!  It's like the Benghazi chant on Fox News.  Over an 82-game sample.  Like, yeah, sure, Calgary was probably not as good as their record the way Colorado wasn't the year before, but isn't it a little strange that these same folks are willing to proclaim Eakins a savior 27 games into the season after the team won 4 of 5 (or whatever it was), just because Corsi numbers are better?  I mean, 2013-2014 and early 2014-2015 broke my bond to that group.  I was watching a disaster on the ice, then I'd come to the comments section and read about how the shot totals were better than under Krueger.  I can handle arrogance - I read Dellow's blog and his arguments with Staples and Spector on Twitter and supported him - but when not just the results but the product on the ice are contrasting so badly with what the fancy stats say, I have to say they've lost for the forest for the trees.  I didn't post more than 20 comments in 2014-2015 between ON, LT, and Coppernblue combined.  I'd read the posts, I'd skim the comments, but 10 games into 2014-2015 I was done.  http://lowetide.ca/2014/11/01/canucks-at-oilers-g11-2014-15/ - I'm pretty sure that was my breaking point.  The dissonance between the product and the numbers was too much.   And historically bad goaltending. Historically bad.   That coincided perfectly with the Eakins era.  Dubnyk, Labarbera, Scrivens, Fasth.  Four goaltenders with career worst numbers under him.  Only Bryzgalov produced close to his career average.   No it didn't. The reason the evidence was found was precisely because of sustained belief in the predictive power of Corsi over the long term.   Right, but the reason the question was asked was because Corsi was failing so hard.  The better Corsi got the worse the team was doing.  That's the ""kick in the teeth from 110 games"" part."
EdmontonOilers,3c4v4y,Icekommander,0,Sun Jul 5 17:40:18 2015 UTC,"I don't see how Dubnyk goes from a career .915-920 SP before Eakins, to terrible under Eakins, then to Vezina finalist the season after he leaves, and this isn't somehow related to Dallas Eakins and what he did to the Oilers.   Well, I didn't say it isn't related at all, just that 'shot quality' was not the culprit, at least as far as the information we have tells us. For comparison, his 2 games with the Preds that year (a team with amazing D) had even worse stats, while his 8 games with Hamilton were ECHL level stuff. I like(d) Dubnyk, but something happened that year that destroyed his confidence. I suspected he would rebound, bu also suspected he would need a serious change of scenery for it to happen. That said, he was unequivicoably bad that year for every team he palyed for, not just Edmonton.   He didn't need a crystal ball. He needed to get a bigger sample size. For a stats guy he sure loves to find something in a 3-10 game stretch and make a bold proclamation about it.   Oh fuck off with that. There is no bold proclamation in that quote. It is a ""things are going well at the moment."" Nothing more.   t. And God forbid you criticize it and get into an argument with him, because then he'll dig up 20 boring numbers about that stretch, 10 iffy comparables, plant his flag on that hill and fight to the death on it.   The only honest thing you said here is boring numbers, and it reveals a lot about you. You're clearly bored by numbers, so that should be the end of this. You don't actually have any idea about analytics, nor seem interested in learning. If it bores you fine, but don't pretend you have any idea what you are talking about.

And now you're pissing me off with more bull crap. Nobody was proclaiming him a saviour. In fact, everyone was simply showing cautious optimism.     but when not just the results but the product on the ice are contrasting so badly with what the fancy stats say, I have to say they've lost for the forest for the trees    This is how I know you are just full of it and are cherry picking. I have already pointed out that when that situation arose, work was done to investigate why, and a likely candidate of an explanation was found. No one on that blog who is involved with generating these types of statistics said ""WELL IT MUST BE THE DEVIL BECAUSE THE CORSI SAYS THEY ARE GOOD!"" What they said was ""Corsi is good but results still suck. What is the cause?"" They are interested in learning more, unlike you apparently.   That coincided perfectly with the Eakins era. Dubnyk, Labarbera, Scrivens, Fasth. Four goaltenders with career worst numbers under him. Only Bryzgalov produced close to his career average.   So? Still incredibly small sample sizes. Do you believe that it was all Eakins doing or something? Scrivens didn't bounce back after Eakins left. More-over, there has been a lot of work done to try to figure out the relationship between sv% and coaching/systems, and the results have all shown that there isn't really a link. Good goalies are good, bad goalies are bad, and middling goalies can have hot or cold seasons. Your ideas here are the same ones that proclaimed Roy an Adams trophy winner because Varly had a career year, and called him a terrible coach this year because his goaltender wasn't Hasek-esque again, when everyone with a brain was calling for a steep regression (in fact, you can search my postings from a year ago to see me calling for them to miss the playoffs).  Honestly, you don't seem to have any clue what you are talking about, and are disparaging commentators who have put a lot of work into trying to understand simply because you are too lazy or too stupid to try to. If it makes you feel better to blame Eakins for everything that happened in the last two seasons, go for it. You have a lot in common with Avs fans who want to string up Roy for his shitty coaching, and about as much respect from me."

EdmontonOilers,3c4xbx,ClintonsDix,10,Sat Jul 4 21:34:37 2015 UTC,"They love trying to trade for Yak too. ""Eller for Yak, straight up, great deal for the Oilers! They should even throw in a 3rd, we're doing them a favour""  How bout no."
EdmontonOilers,3c4xbx,shweet44722,9,Sun Jul 5 00:17:59 2015 UTC,I hate ALL Yak trades. Literally every single one of them. They all think they can fool us into thinking he's a bust and grab some sort of a low-balling bargain deal. Fool us. The ones who actually watch him play every game.
EdmontonOilers,3c4xbx,notsoyoungpadawan,5,Sun Jul 5 02:14:56 2015 UTC,"I mean, there's a solid chance the vast majority of us overrate his trade value and how much teams would be willing to give up for him, but that's part of being fans. We love the guy so if we're hearing trade offers we feel they have to be massive overpayments to justify letting him go.  With that said, pretty much every offer I've seen for Yakupov has severely underestimated his potential and value. It's about finding that happy median, which can be difficult to do, but it doesn't help much when people throw out offers so shit that you can't help but laugh."
EdmontonOilers,3c4xbx,shweet44722,9,Sun Jul 5 02:19:45 2015 UTC,"You know what, its not even my love for Yak that's inflicting this kind of a reaction. Its the swindling attitude with every trade that is offered to us that I have a problem with. Its the ""yeah they're at the bottom of the league, so they'd love to take our worst player and give us one of their top prospects"" that I absolutely fucking abhor.  If someone actually bothered to offer a sensible, well thought out trade involving Yak, I'd be perfectly OK to discuss it. Imagining Chia's job just makes me think he has to deal with this kind of bullshit everyday."
EdmontonOilers,3c4xbx,notsoyoungpadawan,4,Sun Jul 5 02:29:30 2015 UTC,"Fair point. Guess that's part of the online culture?

EdmontonOilers,3c4xbx,shweet44722,3,Sun Jul 5 02:35:02 2015 UTC,"Definitely is.  And I'm not so sure about that. I'd imagine some of the stereotypes do carry over into the business like in every facet of life. Ultimately, GMs are only going to offer what they feel is the right price for a player based on their own evaluation of the player, rather than a scout's or anyone else's."
EdmontonOilers,3c4xbx,notsoyoungpadawan,3,Sun Jul 5 02:39:43 2015 UTC,"I'm sure some do, but if they take too much of an elitist attitude it would limit their potential acquisition of assets. I mean you're always going to try to lowball in trades, you want to get the best deal you can, but any GM with any sort of sensibility is going to have to approach a team with some sort of a reasonable offer or they'll get shut down and lose their chance at the player(s) or future trades. Unless you're Sweeney apparently.  I'm sure everyone has a different view of a price on a player, but it's about coming to that middlepoint, and if GMs can't realistically do that, I'd imagine the seller would be more likely to back out unless they reeeeally need to get rid of the player. Almost always a secondary buyer after all."

EdmontonOilers,3c45rk,onekneedown,11,Sat Jul 4 16:31:19 2015 UTC,"I don't think there's any benefit for him to ask for arbitration, it's not all that likely that he'd get a raise as he's not undervalued on his current deal.   He's not as overvalued as most around here believe because contrary to popular opinion he's not a 2 million dollar or less defenseman but he's definitely not undervalued.   He could be waiting to see if they want to work out a long term deal.   Do the QO's expire or can he wait it out before accepting it?"
EdmontonOilers,3c45rk,haterbehatin,4,Sat Jul 4 16:44:57 2015 UTC,"He has until December 1 to accept. if he doesn't accept, he is ineligible to play this year, and I have no clue what happens after that"
EdmontonOilers,3c45rk,YouJagaloon,2,Sat Jul 4 16:52:42 2015 UTC,Has the arbitration date passed? I remember the deadline is sometime in early July.   I don't see a big deal. Remember he and Petry weren't signed last year until almost September. It's still early; a lot of the top UFAs haven't even signed yet.
EdmontonOilers,3c45rk,tsn123456789,2,Sun Jul 5 05:04:00 2015 UTC,I found this site but I coulldn't find a date on the article to say for sure if it's current. It says July 5th is the deadline for players to file for arbitration.   I don't see Schultz filing for arbitration though. If the club isin't offering a multi year deal he's probably best to just accept is QO and hope to improve his play and land a multi year deal next summer.   I think it's definitely not a big deal either way because unlike the Petry situation a 1 year deal won't screw the team.
EdmontonOilers,3c45rk,haterbehatin,2,Sun Jul 5 05:13:21 2015 UTC,Yeah I think they agree on something. It's still really early into the summer; Schultz was signed last year on Aug. 28.
EdmontonOilers,3c45rk,tsn123456789,7,Sun Jul 5 05:18:43 2015 UTC,I think youre right. He will sign. He has no leverage. He knows he need to have a big bounce back year or his nhl future will be in question.   I believe if he plays roughly 15 easier minutes a night he can be a solid offensive contributor. His AHL numbers were no accident. I think he will be a lot better this year than most of us expect.
EdmontonOilers,3c45rk,shittybillz,5,Sat Jul 4 17:58:58 2015 UTC,"Could the team convince him to go to arbitration so we open up the ability to buy out Nikitin? That would be sweet, but I'm not sure how arbitration would go..."
EdmontonOilers,3c45rk,likeBruceSpringsteen,1 point,Sat Jul 4 16:57:46 2015 UTC,"As I understand it, if he goes to arbitration he will get a raise, as the idea is that he thinks he's worth more than what he's getting, and so few would be OK with Schultz getting $4M, even if it means sending Nikitin out."
EdmontonOilers,3c45rk,9Bains,4,Sat Jul 4 18:22:59 2015 UTC,I'm wondering what the delay is as well. I don't see a benefit to him waiting unless he is intending to take the Oilers to arbitration. I don't think he'd win a case to make more than his QO though.
EdmontonOilers,3c45rk,falsekoala,2,Sat Jul 4 17:34:22 2015 UTC,The team also has the option to take him to arbitration don't they? So they can actually bring his cap hit down to close to 3?
EdmontonOilers,3c45rk,bigfatphony,2,Sat Jul 4 17:17:31 2015 UTC,I think 10% below last year's value is the minimum arbitration could settle on (I think that would be a hair under 3.3).  I'm pretty sure the only way he could be paid less than that is if he hit the open market.
EdmontonOilers,3c45rk,MostlyHarmlessEmu,2,Sat Jul 4 17:53:00 2015 UTC,"I still think Chia is not done with deals, we have 1 too many d men, maybe 2. If Schultz doesnt want to sign and makes a big hubub about it I see Pete might try to move him. I really doubt that situation though, I think he signs and I see either Nikitin or Ference moving before him. But I wouldn't be opposed to shipping Schultz + out if Pete finds a top dman for a return.   Schultzy is still young and fits into the lower 4 pairing well. I think last year was a write off for him and a lot of players, I want to see how he and the other core guys perform under Maclellan."
EdmontonOilers,3c45rk,Spencerhutch,2,Sat Jul 4 18:45:20 2015 UTC,"I know that we want either his production to improve or his defence to get better... preferably both. But I hardly think 3.6 is steep for a defenceman who has consistently put up over 30 points, and has showed potential as a 50+ point player.  I know we want more from him, but let's not completely devalue his body of work. I think a 4 mil contract would be fair, and I'd even be cool with a 4-6 year contract on that as he has the potential to far exceed his contract value. Worst-case scenario he's a 3rd pairing PP specialist, and you'll be hard pressed to find player like that in the league for under 4."

He had wheels and a sense for zone entry and puck control. In his time here he got older and lost his speed, combine that with a limited skill set in his own zone has just turned him into a liability.

Saskatoon (Oilers), Regina (Jets), Red Deer (Flames), Victoria (Vancouver), Thunder Bay (Senators).  I think Saskatoon, Regina, Victoria and Red Deer can all support an WHL team as well as an AHL one.  Attendance would be better too.  I think those locations would do better than many of the US locales.  I'm sure we'll read in three years time that the AHL expansion into California will be a bust."

The CSP hype is incredible.  Edit: McDavid takes a rebound shot that bumps off Nagelvoort's glove and dribbles into the net, people cheer and Nurse turns and gives him heck for it and Connor's all smiles.

EdmontonOilers,3bx1pb,WobblyHobbly,17,Thu Jul 2 21:21:26 2015 UTC,I'm glad were sticking with Scribbles. He deserves a shot here with an actual defense in front of him. His numbers will improve.
EdmontonOilers,3bx1pb,YAK_ATTACK_CALL_911,2,Thu Jul 2 23:10:17 2015 UTC,"He's had good career numbers.  He regressed last season, but I don't see why he couldn't excel in a backup role."
EdmontonOilers,3bx1pb,putzeh,2,Fri Jul 3 15:54:34 2015 UTC,I'm not sure Chia wanted to stick with Scribbles until Neuvirth and Ramo got picked up -- his interest in these guys would imply that.  Maybe he wanted a guy who'd been proven in a 1a/1b situation so that there was an upgrade in case Talbot needed the safety net?
EdmontonOilers,3bx1pb,Roughly6Owls,6,Fri Jul 3 17:48:47 2015 UTC,Oh well hopefully scribbles will try hard this year to try and prove himself in front of a more competent defence. Being behind the worst defence in the league tends to make you look bad.

EdmontonOilers,3bw22q,Shottaz83,5,Thu Jul 2 16:56:38 2015 UTC,"I agree he's better than Petry, but contract wise Petry's is actually structured a little better here.

He has a 15 Team NTC the last three years (instead of 2), so essentially MTL can move him in the 4th year of his contract (instead of 5) and his salary is only 3M (or 4M if year 3) to the team taking him vs 5.5M cap hit. He's also a little younger so chances are he starts declining later into the deal than Sekera does."
EdmontonOilers,3bw22q,9Bains,2,Thu Jul 2 17:00:41 2015 UTC,"Petry may be worse as a player, but he is worth that contract as much as Sekera is worth his. Teams wants both right and left handed D, and there are less RHD than LHD, so supply and demand laws says that he gets more than a LHD with the same skill.  As for those who don't believe in the importance of handedness in Hockey, we got rid of Gordon (a LHC) and got Letestu (a RHC) to replace him, and the Oilers are more versatile for it."
EdmontonOilers,3bw22q,A5hcrack,2,Thu Jul 2 18:22:51 2015 UTC,Gordon shoots right.
EdmontonOilers,3bw22q,9Bains,1 point,Thu Jul 2 18:37:46 2015 UTC,"I remembered hearing Chia say something about handedness when talking about getting Letestu and replacing Gordon and how it's ""another tool for the coach to use."" Here's the quote, starting at the question I didn't check until just now, but you are correct. I guess I didn't get the quote, or the situation, I guess."
EdmontonOilers,3bw22q,A5hcrack,1 point,Fri Jul 3 01:17:33 2015 UTC,I just listened to it an hour ago. Chia screwed it up. Lol if he can't keep it straight how can we be expected to?
EdmontonOilers,3bw22q,9Bains,1 point,Fri Jul 3 02:01:54 2015 UTC,"Yeah, when I got the response and listened to it again, I was so confused. weird that he didn't have it straight, he seemed like the kind of guy that has his stuff straight and well studied on these things. New organisation though, so I guess he gets some leeway."
EdmontonOilers,3bw22q,9Bains,1 point,Fri Jul 3 03:15:10 2015 UTC,"Well Gordon shoots right as well but I personally think it is a factor, helps with versatility, but it's not going to be the end of the world if we have one extra guy who shoots one way vs another way. I mean Tampa has one rightie on their blueline and they made the Finals. Same with the Ducks. Hawks also only played with two righties. DET has only one right shooter on their entire team until they added Green etc. etc. There's some teams with too many RHD and not enough left; it's not uncommon to not have perfect handedness pairings but those teams are still succeeding."
EdmontonOilers,3bw22q,But-Seriously-Though,1 point,Thu Jul 2 19:12:43 2015 UTC,"You're right, of course, it doesn't matter as much as people make it out to be, but it definitely is a factor. The fact is that there are less RH players than LH players, which is why there's the disparity in teams. This simply makes it easier for the RH skater to play the right side than a LH skater. Skill and ability is more important than handedness, of course. I quoted where my mistake came from in another comment in this tread, if you're interested."
EdmontonOilers,3bw22q,Loire55,8,Fri Jul 3 01:26:09 2015 UTC,Yeah but.... Its Petry

EdmontonOilers,3bw22q,Backfire16,6,Thu Jul 2 19:33:50 2015 UTC,"for 31 games, and they underperformed in the playoffs. Listening to team 1260 this morning they mentioned his contract as a most likely to be bought out, haha. I don't really understand the love affair for him, he makes way too many mental mistakes.  Hell, you get into advanced stats and he was still a negative corsi after moving away from Edmonton. His on-ice save percentage is terrible with the best goalie in the league backing him, and he's a negative on/off ice +/-. Which basically all tells me he's the cause of high percentage scoring chances against - which corresponds exactly with what I saw when he played for us.  Montreal can keep the giveaway machine."

EdmontonOilers,3bw22q,pan0ramic,5,Thu Jul 2 16:56:22 2015 UTC,"the salary may drop to 4.5 but the cap hit always is the same throughout the length of a contract, no matter the yearly salary"
EdmontonOilers,3bw22q,El_reverso,3,Thu Jul 2 21:18:02 2015 UTC,"I know, that's why it's easier to dump"
EdmontonOilers,3bw22q,haterbehatin,1 point,Thu Jul 2 21:42:05 2015 UTC,"That's true, but I bet that most teams are more concerned with the cap than the actual salary amount?"
EdmontonOilers,3bw22q,DocDiggler,2,Fri Jul 3 01:27:33 2015 UTC,"If we're looking to dump Sekera, I doubt he has much hockey value (or else we would keep him on the roster), so such a trade would be closer to a cap dump in which case the salary is more important than the cap hit since it's most likely a tanking team trying to get him. If cap is an issue we can always retain part of it."
EdmontonOilers,3bw22q,haterbehatin,1 point,Fri Jul 3 01:50:38 2015 UTC,"Yes, you are right. But for teams like Florida and Arizona, teams with self imposed caps, who can spend less money on an aging asset and reach the cap floor for less by piling a few of these assets together."
EdmontonOilers,3bw22q,DocDiggler,4,Fri Jul 3 11:58:36 2015 UTC,"I think that's a pretty reasonable limit for those NTC, if they desperately need to move him because of Klefbom, Nurse and Reinhart all excelling it should mean that he's movable unless his play completely falls off a cliff."
EdmontonOilers,3bw22q,haterbehatin,4,Thu Jul 2 17:36:18 2015 UTC,Best case scenario is we're in a position where we don't need to unload his contract because we'd like to retain him for depth. But it's nice to know we're open to options. Hopefully he ain't Ference in 5 years which I don't think he will be.
EdmontonOilers,3bx097,But-Seriously-Though,23,Thu Jul 2 21:09:49 2015 UTC,"You may not be sold on Yak, but after next season, you will be. We've been waiting for 3 seasons but he is finally going to break out next season. I have 0% doubt about that. And especially if he plays on a line with McDavid. My God, the tingles are taking over!"
EdmontonOilers,3bx097,notsoyoungpadawan,2,Thu Jul 2 22:11:33 2015 UTC,Dont get me wrong Im hoping he puts in 50 this year but im expecting like 12
EdmontonOilers,3bx097,notsoyoungpadawan,15,Thu Jul 2 22:12:42 2015 UTC,Nah. No way he scores anything under what he got this season. I expect him to be a 60 point player next season.
EdmontonOilers,3bx097,DocDiggler,2,Thu Jul 2 22:16:25 2015 UTC,"Im hoping im wrong, im a huge fan of his, I got a #10 Yakupov jersey at home, Im just aiming low hoping to not be disappointed, I have been all aboard the Yak train since his draft day and he has let me down thus far, im going with a different approach in my love for him."
EdmontonOilers,3bx097,notsoyoungpadawan,9,Thu Jul 2 22:18:23 2015 UTC,"You have to remember, this is the first year Yak has had a center. The Yotes gave up on Gagner and that's the guy he had his best (rookie) production year with. He's going to be playing with Connor effin McDavid man. He's putting up points this year."
EdmontonOilers,3bx097,9Bains,2,Thu Jul 2 22:33:52 2015 UTC,Hes also had stretches with Nuge that showed very little difference
EdmontonOilers,3bx097,AlleyBj,4,Thu Jul 2 22:36:07 2015 UTC,"Nuge wasn't as quick before this season, so he had a tough time keeping up. Watch McDavid and Yak blow teams apart. If Hall is on that line too it might just be the fastest line in hockey."
EdmontonOilers,3bx097,9Bains,2,Thu Jul 2 22:52:01 2015 UTC,fastest line in the NHL? Hall-McDavid-Yak are all speed demons and I can't think of a line with 3 guys as fast as them.
EdmontonOilers,3bx097,9Bains,2,Fri Jul 3 01:30:15 2015 UTC,Cogliano and Hagelin are both very fast on the Ducks but thats all I can think of.

EdmontonOilers,3bx097,McEirhead,4,Fri Jul 3 17:02:16 2015 UTC,"I guess you don't remember his rookie season when Kruger finally put Nuge, Hall, and Yak together and they were scoring. Being shifted back to the third line was Eakins fault, not Yaks, and he regressed because of it."
EdmontonOilers,3bx097,putzeh,3,Thu Jul 2 22:56:23 2015 UTC,I suppressed all memory of the Kruger and Eakins eras
EdmontonOilers,3bx097,broccolifucker,1 point,Fri Jul 3 00:40:34 2015 UTC,"I'm kind of expecting McDavid to hit between 70-100 points (lofty expectations I know) so if Yak holds down a top 2 line winger position, he should be above 70 points I think."
EdmontonOilers,3bx097,Berding,1 point,Fri Jul 3 13:32:44 2015 UTC,"Thats expecting way to much out of both in my opinion but I hope your right, I tend to be more of a pessimist on these types of things though"
EdmontonOilers,3bx097,AlleyBj,1 point,Fri Jul 3 15:46:40 2015 UTC,"Connor's the type of guy who makes everyone around him better. So even if his rookie numbers are in the lower bracket of 50-70 points, I do expect most of the rest of the forward group to have career highs this year. But as a result of that effect, I'm pegging my predictions around the 90-100 point mark. Officially I'm predicting 97, haha.  The last player to have a more productive junior playoffs before going pro (afaik) was Mario Lemieux. Crosby had 31 points in 13 games and then had a 102 point rookie season. McDavid had 49 points in 20 games.  The league goal-scoring average is down to 2.73 from 3.08 when Crosby was a rookie,   If you take (Crosby's rookies season point total) * (McDavid's draft year playoff pace / Crosby's draft year playoff pace) * (Last Year's goal-scoring average / Crosby's rookie year goal scoring average) you get 93 points.  And my personal opinion is that the goal scoring averages are going to be up next year because of 3 on 3 OT."
EdmontonOilers,3bx097,tsn123456789,1 point,Fri Jul 3 18:28:24 2015 UTC,"wow, you put alot of thought into that, I really do hope that your right, but Im predicting around 67 points for McDavid this season. On the other hand, Now that Nuge is no longer the biggest threat at center to the opposition and will be facing the other teams second pairing Dmen most nights in what will be his 4th(?) year in the league, im predicting he comes in at 80-100pts"
EdmontonOilers,3bx097,LafayetteHubbard,1 point,Fri Jul 3 18:32:02 2015 UTC,Could you imagine if we had 2 centers sniffing at 100 points? If they produce that good you have to think that playoffs would be an inevitability.
EdmontonOilers,3bx097,tsn123456789,1 point,Fri Jul 3 18:47:27 2015 UTC,"Yeah doubtful there is enough ice time to go around for that to happen but hey, why not hope right?"
EdmontonOilers,3bx097,LafayetteHubbard,10,Fri Jul 3 20:51:26 2015 UTC,I think PC's job through out the year and into next season will be to find bottom 6 scoring.  Purcell and Korpawhatever won't be enough.
EdmontonOilers,3bx097,tsn123456789,2,Thu Jul 2 21:15:15 2015 UTC,"Yeah, now that Gordon's gone. Am I the only one who thought that our 'wagon' line was the only part of the team that didn't need any adjusting at all when the season ended? What a shame."
EdmontonOilers,3bx097,supertroll1999,1 point,Fri Jul 3 00:22:13 2015 UTC,I felt that way as well until we signed Letestu. I will hold my judgement on the wagon line until I see what happens with it.
EdmontonOilers,3bx097,tsn123456789,1 point,Fri Jul 3 06:09:39 2015 UTC,"exactly my thoughts, thats where im thinking we should take a run at glencross or ward or maybe chris stewart, see if we can get one of them at like 3-Mil per year and play them on the 3rd line, knowing that if need be they can play top 6 but hope they stay bottom 6"
EdmontonOilers,3bx097,ABirdOfParadise,3,Thu Jul 2 21:21:18 2015 UTC,I don't think we do. Yak is certainly good enough to play 2 RW and if anything ever happened I'm confident enough that Purcell could take the spot for an injury. If we were going to get anyone it'd probably be  a 3 LW but that would mean a) Drai would 100% be in the AHL and b) Korpi wouldn't have a place cause Hendricks is our 4 LW.
EdmontonOilers,3bx097,tsn123456789,1 point,Thu Jul 2 21:15:26 2015 UTC,"Im okay with both of those consequences, Drai will not be harmed at all by playing the majority if not all of next season in the A, and if Korpisominthingorother ends up as a scratch or on waivers then so be it.   EDIT: I would also disagree on your point that Purcell is capable of stepping into a 2nd line role, I think at this point in his career hes an extremely over paid 3rd line guy."
EdmontonOilers,3bx097,ABirdOfParadise,4,Thu Jul 2 21:18:55 2015 UTC,"We already have too many bottom six wingers and we're right at the cap right now so there's no way to add more unless we manage to dump Purcell or Nikitin. I don't like the Korpi acquisition but we're stuck with him. As far as offense there's no affordable wingers on the market right now that's worth our time. Purcell got 34 points last year splitting between the 2nd and third line, most of the guys on the market right now couldn't even match that."
EdmontonOilers,3bx097,DocDiggler,1 point,Thu Jul 2 21:49:30 2015 UTC,I thought we were 11 million under right now
EdmontonOilers,3bx097,Main_man_mike,1 point,Fri Jul 3 01:21:36 2015 UTC,We're 9M under without Schultz and McDavid. Those two probably cost around 7-8M.
EdmontonOilers,3bx097,Colotech,2,Fri Jul 3 01:45:53 2015 UTC,McDavid will be on a rookie contract
EdmontonOilers,3bx097,AlleyBj,2,Fri Jul 3 01:53:05 2015 UTC,"His rookie deal carries a 3.75M cap hit  Edit: actually probably a little higher than that, 3.775M"
EdmontonOilers,3bx097,stelts94,0,Fri Jul 3 01:53:55 2015 UTC,"That's only if he hits all the bonuses, like if he were to win the Art Ross and things like that."
EdmontonOilers,3bx097,haterbehatin,3,Fri Jul 3 05:10:38 2015 UTC,"Well we have no idea what the bonus structures are, but typically it's not ridiculous. I believe Gaudreau hit his bonuses for this year. I know we get a cushion for the bonuses so that saves us a bit of cap, but suffice to say McDavid should hit all of his bonuses (likely points, rookie scoring, Calder nomination etc.). But whatever the case we don't have much cap to work with. Normally you'd like at least 5% of cap space to work with in case of trades mid-season etc."
EdmontonOilers,3bx097,bigfatphony,0,Fri Jul 3 05:25:58 2015 UTC,"No probably won't hit all his bonuses (this year at least)  Some of them are insane like,   First, or second Team All-Star, being top 3 in +/- on the team, All Star, All Star MVP, Hart, Rocket, or Selke nominee, Conn Smythe winner, and depending on how well you think he'll do, top 10 in league scoring."
EdmontonOilers,3bx097,bigfatphony,2,Fri Jul 3 09:36:21 2015 UTC,"Like I said, we have no idea what the bonus structure is, from what I hear about rookies (your list is for vets like Toews, Kane etc.) most of them are generally reasonable (or his agent must suck), especially for a guy as good as McDavid. He's not going to agree to a bonus structure that's impossible to hit. Remember that Chia made the mistake of not excepting a guy to hit his bonuses before (Iginla). In any case, it's bad management practice to assume something is impossible when it is possible, so we have to leave ""room"" in our cap just in case rather than spending that extra 1-2M on a grinder we don't need, which goes to my first point where I said that for all intents and purposes we're near the cap or have less cap space than we think."
EdmontonOilers,3bx097,MixBlender,1 point,Fri Jul 3 16:51:35 2015 UTC,Meh I copyed the reward structure from Malkin's rookie contract.
EdmontonOilers,3bwwk5,wildcard_bitches,6,Thu Jul 2 20:40:59 2015 UTC,As long as he's better than Matt Fraser I guess. His gloves aren't filled with concrete which is a good thing. Landers line needs more skill to succeed.  EDIT: Found another article that isn't so bleak and explains a few things about why he's being sold so low. Link here
EdmontonOilers,3bwwk5,DocDiggler,5,Thu Jul 2 22:25:22 2015 UTC,What I get from this article is that he is avg defensively and has some decent offensive tools particularly as a complimentary player. Usually I would prefer the 3rd and 4th liners be better defensively but in todays NHL it seems puck possession and driving play are more important rather than and in that respect maybe Korpi could be useful.
EdmontonOilers,3bwwk5,Colotech,4,Fri Jul 3 00:19:03 2015 UTC,"Also, TMac doesn't use a shutdown line, so he would prefer more skilled players."
EdmontonOilers,3bwwk5,Arunatic5,3,Fri Jul 3 02:43:44 2015 UTC,I like TMac's philosophy as the whole 2 lines scoring-3rd line checking-4th line energy is so old school.
EdmontonOilers,3bwwk5,Colotech,3,Fri Jul 3 02:55:42 2015 UTC,sssoooo hes gordon but faster and cant play D
EdmontonOilers,3bwwk5,But-Seriously-Though,2,Thu Jul 2 22:04:18 2015 UTC,"Has speed and the ability to occasionally dance around a defense is a big plus in my book. I think he'll be better than next season, as it was a bit of a strange year down in Arizona, no one really got any traction except OEL."
EdmontonOilers,3bwwk5,9Bains,1 point,Fri Jul 3 04:56:37 2015 UTC,So keep the expectations low. Got it.
EdmontonOilers,3bwwk5,YAK_ATTACK_CALL_911,0,Thu Jul 2 20:48:08 2015 UTC,not bad for a jR. B player from northern A lberta
EdmontonOilers,3bvj84,likeBruceSpringsteen,18,Thu Jul 2 14:26:21 2015 UTC,You can always go for three A's instead of two and a C.
EdmontonOilers,3bvj84,Reintegration,6,Thu Jul 2 16:59:25 2015 UTC,Which I think would make a lot of sense right now.
EdmontonOilers,3bvj84,StealAllTheInternets,10,Thu Jul 2 19:03:16 2015 UTC,"Rishaug suggested on TSN that what we might do is take Schultz to arbitration and we might buy out Nikitin through that process because it opens up a buy-out period. Chia said we're not done yet with moving people in/out, so its quite possible something happens on that front in the next few days.  As for who'd be my captain... I'd pick Hendricks. He's the only captain worthy player on this team in my opinion. Has passion, gets fired up, defends his teammates, works like a horse.   I don't think we need any of those free agency players now. What we need to do is buy out Nikitin and maybe look for a trade that would improve our roster. Maybe win a few picks or something."
EdmontonOilers,3bvj84,notsoyoungpadawan,3,Thu Jul 2 16:40:45 2015 UTC,The team gave Schultz a qualifying offer and can't take him to arbitration.
EdmontonOilers,3bvj84,grumpyoldham,3,Thu Jul 2 18:30:35 2015 UTC,They can if he rejects it.
EdmontonOilers,3bvj84,notsoyoungpadawan,2,Thu Jul 2 19:07:32 2015 UTC,Oilers need one more player going to arbitration for the second buy out window to open.  Franson honestly is the only UFA who would make sense. He pushes Reinhart and Nurse's development to be more focuses and possibly play (and likely) of playing in Bakersfield.
EdmontonOilers,3bvj84,putzeh,4,Thu Jul 2 17:02:32 2015 UTC,"To be honest, the more I think about it, Franson will want a long term contract, and both Nurse and Reinhart will be in the team in the following season. So it wouldn't be too wise to sign Franson now IMO."
EdmontonOilers,3bvj84,notsoyoungpadawan,9,Thu Jul 2 17:05:11 2015 UTC,"Ference will play out his contract.  Only way you move Nikitin is you either find a team that needs to get to the cap floor (Florida or Arizona.) OR (big or) you find a trade partner for a 7th round pick and you eat some salary. Or bury him in the minors, where only 1/3 of his cap hit will be a problem.  Franson's asking has to have come down now, may be. It is only day 2 of free agency.  Singing anymore than one of those three is too much. This will still be a development year. Team expected to be more competitive but still need young guys to develop."
EdmontonOilers,3bvj84,putzeh,7,Thu Jul 2 15:04:47 2015 UTC,"I'm starting to embrace the idea of keeping Ference and Nikitin unless there is another addition like Franson.   It let's Reinhart and Nurse play in Bakersfield to start the year and there's also the potential that Nikitin could be moved if a defenseman goes down and somebody wants a depth guy.   I base that largely off the assumption that Ference won't agree to be moved, TMaC won't scratch his captain regularly and that they have Gryba penciled in as their bottom pairing right D so I don't think Reinhart or Nurse being in the pressbox Eakins style is a good plan."
EdmontonOilers,3bvj84,haterbehatin,11,Thu Jul 2 15:25:16 2015 UTC,"Ference will still be captain but its debatable as to how much playing time he's going to get. The guy is 36 and headed downhill FAST, and I imagine that management wants to get the young guys in there sooner rather than later. I thought that he only had 1 year left on his contract until a couple of weeks ago. God, that was a nasty surprise.  As far as captaincy goes, it's gotta be Hall. If Hendricks was a few years younger, I think there might be a bit of an argument for him. But not now.  As far as Nikitin goes ... just suck it up. It's only 1 more year, and they might be able to get a late round draft pick for him at the trade deadline. Who knows."
EdmontonOilers,3bvj84,paul-mccartney,1 point,Thu Jul 2 15:22:08 2015 UTC,"For a defense who's 36 and declining fast, what about retirement? Can Ference still play at an NHL level?"
EdmontonOilers,3bvj84,jordanrhys,3,Thu Jul 2 23:42:11 2015 UTC,"I think he can still play, just not top 4 minutes. I dont mind him as a 3rd pairing guy, but if we have the chance to get someone better i wouldnt be upset."
EdmontonOilers,3bvj84,thesublieutenant,4,Fri Jul 3 00:54:04 2015 UTC,"Ference will not waive his NMC, and will likely remain as captain, unless he gives it up, which might happen. Hendricks is a leader, but I don't want him to get it because he isn't gonna be a permanent fixture on the team, so if he does give it up one of Nuge or Hall should get it. They drive play on the Ice and will be around for their entire career.  Moving Nikitin could happen. There are 3 teams that are below the cap floor, and New Jersey only has 4 defensemen according to General Fanager. so maybe there, other options are cap crunched teams and we retain money., Chicago is the only real option up there. Purcell may also be treated in a similar manner.   The Oilers probably can get them, but shouldn't. We hace 9 D right now, getting another will cause more problems. We'll need to give away D now, more than we need more of them."
EdmontonOilers,3bvj84,9Bains,1 point,Thu Jul 2 16:49:08 2015 UTC,That must just be who they have signed because New Jersey has:  Greene-Larsson  Gelinas- Severson  Merrill- Moore  Those are just off the top of my head so I'm probably missing somebody.
EdmontonOilers,3bvj84,haterbehatin,2,Thu Jul 2 16:54:36 2015 UTC,"I just read it off their cap space page, It didn't seem right, but I just thought that there were trades I missed or they were UFAs that I didn't keep track of over the past few days. thanks for the update"
EdmontonOilers,3bvj84,9Bains,6,Thu Jul 2 18:26:32 2015 UTC,"Ference will be our Captain next year because he would not move his NTC and even if he would who would want him?  We lost out on Dougie Hamilton so I doubt he gets the C (if we have another Hamilton in the system that your referencing Im sorry) For the sake of argument I actually think Nugent-Hopkins would be a good choice, obviously Im not in the room but I get the sense we dont have many vocal leaders so you might as well give it to someone who plays the game the right way and Nuge does. However we would probably be better off keeping it on an older player that will retire in 3-4 years than do the whole give it to your best player thing ala Pittsburgh, Washington, Islanders etc and give it to McDavid   I think questions 3 & 4 somewhat tie together, I hope they can off Nikitin, I dont know if its possible with that ugly contract and buying him out isnt a good option because he only has a year left so we might as well let him try to do something somewhat useful. However if my prayers are again answered and we get rid of that Potato then I think maybe the oilers would look at a guy like Franson, not for the type of contract that Sekera got though, but Im pretty much thinking they are out on the latter two, they dont fit the system and are honestly only minor improvements over the likes of Klefbom and Fayne and probably cost alot more."
EdmontonOilers,3bvj84,But-Seriously-Though,4,Thu Jul 2 15:01:38 2015 UTC,"Stupid autocorrect. Hendricks, not Hamilton. Fixed. Thanks for the reply though!"
EdmontonOilers,3bvj84,McEirhead,4,Thu Jul 2 15:11:15 2015 UTC,"You gotta think that sometime over the next 16 months, McJesus is going to be named captain. Maybe not this year, but certainly by next year assuming he's all that (and from what I saw of him in the ohl playoffs, he is)."
EdmontonOilers,3bvj84,But-Seriously-Though,3,Thu Jul 2 15:27:25 2015 UTC,"Im guessing Ference retires at the end of this contract and then McSaviour takes over, that will be for the start of his 3rd season I believe"
EdmontonOilers,3bvj84,haterbehatin,2,Thu Jul 2 16:05:43 2015 UTC,There's a lot of potential leaders aside from McDavid. He'll probably be a candidate but I don't think he's the de facto captain.
EdmontonOilers,3bvj84,But-Seriously-Though,3,Thu Jul 2 17:24:15 2015 UTC,"Today's nhl thats kinda what happens tho, yes there are other candidates, Jordan Eberle and Taylor Hall have been through it all with this team and deserve some sort of internal recognition (and they already have the As) Nuge, who would be my choice but its not up to me, seems incredibly quiet but we arent in the room and maybe thats not the case, he does however play this game the way that its meant to be played, he works hard in both ends, doesnt take stupid penalty and if the whole team would follow his work ethic it would be great. The point I made however is that teams often give the captaincy to their best player, I think its almost symbolic at this point as to say ""hey this is our guy, stop him if you can, he has our teams support"" look at ovechkin in Washington, does he seem like a leader? not to me.... but again we arent in the room so who knows"
EdmontonOilers,3bvj84,McEirhead,2,Thu Jul 2 20:39:22 2015 UTC,"I do prefer that the guy who's putting up all the points is also the one who's allowed to talk to the refs when it matters. He'll be the one teams will focus on, and he seems like a pretty mature non-whiner who's going to lead by example. Also, you want a guy who's going to be on the ice a lot to be wearing the C and not a 7th d-man. So that's basically 5 for 5 on my checklist of requirements. Assuming he shows like our best player, I think it's a slam dunk."
EdmontonOilers,3bvj84,haterbehatin,1 point,Thu Jul 2 20:46:03 2015 UTC,"It's possible, I'm not saying he definitely won't be, just that there are many candidates.  The other thing is it hasn't exactly been the Oilers way to name their best player captain, it's been years and years of journeymen hard hat guys like Ference who have been named captain.  If they keep with the trend, expect Hendricks to be the next captain."
EdmontonOilers,3bvj84,A5hcrack,2,Thu Jul 2 21:48:49 2015 UTC,"1) I think you go with a bunch of A's until Christmas and then put it to a player vote. Where has Ference's leadership taken this team? His appointment as Captian was indicative of everything that has been wrong with this team.   2) nope. He wanted stability for his family and loves the City. It's not happening.   3) half salary retained and a return of a prospect another team has written off completely during training camp will probably get it done.   4) I don't think we should. At least not with any term. I mean if Franson would sign for 4 AAV on a three year term. Sure, then we take Schultz to arbitration, ditch Nikitin, send the kids to the AHL for the year and call it a day."
EdmontonOilers,3bvj84,br4ndnewbr4d,2,Thu Jul 2 17:37:05 2015 UTC,"I think Nuge is the choice for Captain. Young, but the most talented/motivated/team leading player on the oilers I believe. Hall has shown that hes not leadership material, plenty of evidence and opinions out there that he doesnt say much in the dressing room and has a general bad-ish attitude in there. Nuge all day."
EdmontonOilers,3bvj84,tsn123456789,4,Fri Jul 3 03:39:16 2015 UTC,"1&2. Ference has a NMC so he's not going anywhere. And there's no way we're gonna be like the Sharks and start stripping the C off of guys who's still on our team. Also I don't think we have a Hamilton on our team.....  3 Very unlikely, if we retain half his salary and attach a pick to him maybe  4 I don't think we have enough cap space to offer Franson (and I don't want him anyways, he's a bottom pairing guy). Ehrhoff and Oduya have their own share of risks but anything over 3M and/or long term I would say no."
EdmontonOilers,3bvj84,shittybillz,3,Thu Jul 2 14:42:39 2015 UTC,"Stupid autocorrect. Hendricks, not Hamilton. Fixed. Thanks for the reply though!"
EdmontonOilers,3bvj84,StraightDegan,1 point,Thu Jul 2 15:11:31 2015 UTC,"As much as i like Hendricks, im sick of having a captain that rarely contributes to offense. Once Ference is gone I'd like to see three A's instead of a captain right away, unless someone steps up in a big way. Hall, eberle and Hendricks as our A's."
EdmontonOilers,3bvj84,Dr_Marxist,1 point,Thu Jul 2 18:50:05 2015 UTC,"Ference has always been a knowledgeable and mature hockey player. Even though his game has slipped a lot I think he stays on as captain. I think this because he has a great relationship with Chia, and also his knowledge, experience, and demeanor will be great for the young prospects looking to make a jump to the NHL, especially on the blue line, specifically Nurse. I think he stays and plays this year then retires. Why not send him out with another cup?"
EdmontonOilers,3bvj84,IGOR_ULANOV_55_BEST,1 point,Thu Jul 2 20:16:37 2015 UTC,"Let's not pick a captain.  Strip it from Ference, because he's gonna spend all season in the press box.  He's somewhere around #8 in defensive quality if we go on merit.  He's well below some guys on the AHL squad.  Just run four Assistants.  No reason to jump the gun and pick a Captain.  I mean, the Habs did fine with rotating Assistants, finishing first in their division.    I think it's fundamentally something that could be needlessly divisive and a team headache.  Just rotate the Assistantships, and then let the players vote the training camp after next when TCAF is finally gone.  Ference was a bad signing from the get go (this isn't sour grapes, I screamed it from the rooftops) and we're paying for it.  I suspect he sits the majority of the year this year, and retires or gets bought out the next.    Also, unpopular opinion: I watched 75 games last year.  When NN was healthy, he actually was far from the worst defenceman on the Oilers (which, was, yes, the worst Dcore in the league).  Also, he only has one year left.  We bite the bullet, keep Griff and Nurse down in California, and bring them up for injuries.  The target for movement has to be TCAF, full stop.  No reason to mortgage the future (NN+3rd for a 7th) to free up cap space we can't move because of TCAF, NN, and Purcell."
EdmontonOilers,3bvj84,haterbehatin,5,Thu Jul 2 17:01:50 2015 UTC,"I agree 100% on Nikitin. When his back wasn't acting up he was a useable piece. I don't think it makes sense to buy him out, but I also would be fine with trading him. He's not as big of a liability as some of the guys we have had on the blueline in the past."
EdmontonOilers,3bvj84,Dr_Marxist,2,Thu Jul 2 19:50:11 2015 UTC,"They all seem like reasonable points to me and if Gryba is going to be the bottom pairing guy and it seems like he's penciled in to be unless there's another add Nikitin is likely a better partner for him than Ference.  Sending out three A's is a completely reasonable plan particularly for a team like Edmonton that has many young leaders but maybe the captain has yet to emerge, perfectly reasonable to allow any of Hall, Nuge, McDavid, Nurse, Reinhart, whoever to step forward and claim a leadership position.   They could even have 6 A's and rotate them.  I just have a very hard time believing that Ference will a) resign as captain or b) be stripped of the captaincy and that makes the politics of it a lot more difficult in terms of his playing time."
EdmontonOilers,3bvj84,haterbehatin,2,Thu Jul 2 17:22:03 2015 UTC,"I just have a very hard time believing that Ference will a) resign as captain or b) be stripped of the captaincy and that makes the politics of it a lot more difficult in terms of his playing time.   Herein lies the rub.  Is the new leadership a ruthless bunch who wants to win, start afresh with a new locker-room vibe, and ergo leave a trail of semi-destruction - or do they want to coddle a broken-down guy who is great for the community but a vitiating problematic and perturbing presence for procuring potential wins?"
EdmontonOilers,3bvj84,But-Seriously-Though,2,Thu Jul 2 17:34:44 2015 UTC,"Yeah it will be telling to see how they approach Ference. Based on his play in his two years in Edmonton it's probably for the best that he's the 7th d man, a buyout this year is impractical in my opinion but as you say choosing to utilize him as a regular would seem to be bad for the team.   McLellan's Sharks weren't shy about stripping captains but rumours that I've seen are that that came more from Doug Wilson than McLellan."
EdmontonOilers,3bvj84,Dr_Marxist,1 point,Thu Jul 2 17:46:32 2015 UTC,But... Who lifts the up when we win it this year?
EdmontonOilers,3bvj84,dcmcderm,2,Thu Jul 2 21:47:54 2015 UTC,Jesus Christ lifts the cup.  Because they only way we're winning it this year is if he drops from the sky and pots 100 points as a Defenseman.
EdmontonOilers,3bvj84,VanPerstrings,1 point,Thu Jul 2 23:22:09 2015 UTC,"Ference is a problem, and a big one.  He has a no movement clause and is unlikely to waive it since he's from Edmonton and firmly entrenched in tons of off ice stuff he seems to love.  Plus even if he waived it, who would take him?  The fact that he's a D means we can't hide him.  A team needs all 6 D to succeed over a full season (Chicago's cup run notwithstanding).  When our past captains stopped performing (Moreau and Horcoff) they could just slide down to 3rd/4th line roles and have a minimal impact.  With Ference we can't do that, nor can we get rid of him.  Even if we end up with 6 competent D, he's still going to be on the roster either blocking someone better, or being a frequent healthy scratch."
EdmontonOilers,3bvj84,bigfatphony,0,Thu Jul 2 18:35:09 2015 UTC,"Give it to Ference for this season, give it to McDavid the season after."
EdmontonOilers,3bvj84,haterbehatin,0,Thu Jul 2 20:34:29 2015 UTC,"Stauffer has been hinting at a ""vet"" d-man getting moved out, and the only two vet d-men we have are Ference and Fayne. Fayne we need.  If that happens, you can't give the C to any of the young guys, because it would be a slight to eventually remove it and give it to McDavid when he's ready. I think you have to give it to Hendricks. And then next season, or the season after, it's McDavid's.  As for moves... I would be happy if that was it. Personally, I'd be a huge fan of an Oshie/Yak swap, but I know that's kind of a pipe dream.   Rishaug brought up a great point, in that a new GM will want to watch the players and see what he has before moving people out. So now that we look more like an NHL hockey club front to back, wouldn't mind seeing how our goats from last season (Nikitin, Yakupov, Ference, Schultz) respond to all the changes."
EdmontonOilers,3bvj84,bigfatphony,2,Thu Jul 2 17:18:18 2015 UTC,You don't consider Nikitin a vet?
EdmontonOilers,3bvj84,haterbehatin,2,Thu Jul 2 17:22:57 2015 UTC,"Well, I guess technically he is, but he sure isn't established like a vet. I just got the sense from Stauffer's comments that he meant Ference, but ya, could be Nikitin too.  I've learned that when Stauffer hints at something, there's more meaning to it than what he says. Like yesterday he specifically said, ""Right shot center"" in his tweet, while mentioning Letestu and nobody else said anything quite as specific as that."
EdmontonOilers,3bvj84,But-Seriously-Though,1 point,Thu Jul 2 18:01:35 2015 UTC,"That makes sense. Isin't he one of the guys that the team leaks info to?   Sort of how they all have stooges in the media to sell their moves.   I agree though that they really need Fayne, if Chiarelli could find someone to take Ference without paying that team to do so or taking back a worse contract that would be amazing."

EdmontonOilers,3bw7oy,paul-mccartney,11,Thu Jul 2 17:37:04 2015 UTC,The thought of this powerplay gets me pretty moist  1) McDavid - Nuge - Hall  Sekera - Eberle  2) Pouliot - Lander - Yakupov  Klefbom - Schultz
EdmontonOilers,3bw7oy,AlleyBj,6,Thu Jul 2 18:05:16 2015 UTC,I'd like to see something like this:  ---------------- BLUE LINE ----------------                       Sekera Nuge/McDavid                              Hall/Yak     Eberle                                 Pouliot
EdmontonOilers,3bw7oy,envague,1 point,Thu Jul 2 17:50:24 2015 UTC,It makes more sense to swap Eberle with Hall/Yak because of handedness.
EdmontonOilers,3bw7oy,parecon,5,Fri Jul 3 12:17:32 2015 UTC,Both of our pp units could be number one powerplays. Maybe this is the over excitement talking but ill be very surprised if were not a top 3  unit in the league
EdmontonOilers,3bw7oy,shittybillz,6,Thu Jul 2 18:40:32 2015 UTC,They'll have to figure out zone entry first. It was the achilles heel of the PP last year.

You need to be mobile because the puck is constnatly moving, so its more about how you position yourself + how well you can battle the D-men. Boyd Gordon was just marginally bigger than Letestu and he pulled off that role extremely well, so I think Letestu should be fine. He's a tough guy."
EdmontonOilers,3bw7oy,notsoyoungpadawan,1 point,Thu Jul 2 22:06:03 2015 UTC,"yeah but you need to be big and strong enough to stand your ground when someone like Byfuglien comes and tells you to move. and truly I think we should maybe hold back on expectations for the test tube, Im super happy we signed him, hes a good role player but his point production has never been anything to think twice about in his career  EDIT: Buff isnt a good example because nobody could fight him off but you get what I mean"

And more often than not, D-men aren't going to be stuck to him trying to shove him off the perimeter because they'll be to worry about the other 4 players on the ice who have the puck."
EdmontonOilers,3bw7oy,notsoyoungpadawan,2,Thu Jul 2 22:17:54 2015 UTC,"First unit: Gazdic, Hendricks, Klinkhammer, Pouliot, Gryba.   Second unit: McDavid, RNH, Hall, Yak, Ebs.

I've never been a fan of four forward PP units. They tend to give up short handed break always. Better to have a Howitzer from the point in my opinion.   Edit: forgot PK. Hendo - Lander, Nuge - Letestu for forwards and Gyrba - Fayne, Klefbom - Reinhart on the point."

EdmontonOilers,3bt75w,ilikecakeeating,10,Wed Jul 1 23:34:54 2015 UTC,I always find it strange when hockey players claim a place is too cold to play hockey in.
EdmontonOilers,3bt75w,johnedeadly,10,Thu Jul 2 00:40:45 2015 UTC,"It's not about the time at the rink. If you could either hit the starter, wait ten minutes while you bundle up, drive home on icy, pot holed roads, park in your garage and stay indoors all night in January after a practice; or buzz home with the top down and jump in the pool by your aspiring actress SO, and her friends......... Edmonton's beautiful in the summer, but jan-March is brutal."
EdmontonOilers,3bt75w,pan0ramic,2,Thu Jul 2 02:34:24 2015 UTC,I just find it funny how their career involves them spending large amounts of time in sub-zero temperatures but then they turn around and claim they don't like the cold.

EdmontonOilers,3bti1d,papercutpete,17,Thu Jul 2 00:45:03 2015 UTC,"As hard as it is for me, I'm tempering my expectations. I have belief that we can be a top team in the NHL again, but nothing is  ever guaranteed in this business. Excitement is good, ridiculous expectations are not. With that being said, this feeling is amazing."
EdmontonOilers,3bti1d,Shottaz83,14,Thu Jul 2 01:01:01 2015 UTC,"When the season starts, McDavid will be 18. Draisaitl will be 19 (turning 20 in late October), Nurse will be 20, Reinhart 21. All of them rookies (well, not Draisaitl, but he might as well be). Yakupov will have just turned 22, Klefbom will be 22, as will Nuge.    I've heard that most players hit their prime somewhere in the 24-27 range; that is over a year away for all those guys. With the possible exception of Nuge, this upcoming season should be seen primarily as a developmental season for all of them -- yes even McDavid. In other words this upcoming season should be a very exciting one, but not necessarily a very winning one. More winning than last season -- but that really isn't saying much.  Also, he didn't really fit into my ramblings on age, but Talbot is another exciting guy fans should maintain some scepticism towards this season. He has the makings of an elite goaltender, but the really elite guys like Rinne and Price played more games last season than Talbot has played in his whole career. Even if he is the goaltender we hope him to be, there are likely going to be some bumps along the way."
EdmontonOilers,3bti1d,Icekommander,3,Thu Jul 2 01:55:53 2015 UTC,"Personally, I expect Hall, Nuge, Yak and Shultz to have career highs this year elevating us into a playoff spot. Without beating around the bush, McJesus is the catalyst... Maybe he doesn't lead the team in points, but his presence will take us to the post season.  The existing core of this team is STARVING for a playoff birth. I think the moves this summer should do it. As long as everyone is on board, we'll do it... I don't see why not?"
EdmontonOilers,3bti1d,McEirhead,5,Thu Jul 2 07:01:44 2015 UTC,"I as well would love the Oil to make it to the post-season and give Rexall Place one last run, but honestly I can't say I have my expectations that high.  With all the moves we made, I'm very excited for next season, but look at our defense.  It's a mix of inexperience, and dead weight  (Nikitin, Ference).  And that's just not a defensive core that can support an essentially unproven starter.  There's still time to make more changes but I feel in two years we have a team to be feared both offensively and defensively."
EdmontonOilers,3bti1d,Ausgebombt,7,Thu Jul 2 14:47:39 2015 UTC,"This. It seems like every year we get excited only to be let down. Even though much has changed this year, I'm in the cautiously optimistic crew. Until TMac has started coaching these players and his philosophies are ingrained into them, nothings really changed."

EdmontonOilers,3bu2c2,Scottishstalion,1 point,Thu Jul 2 14:47:05 2015 UTC,"Yeah the only way I could see it is he got sent back to Jr this year and Erie was either eliminated quickly or didn't make the playoffs, and I can't see that happening."
EdmontonOilers,3bu2c2,haterbehatin,11,Thu Jul 2 14:54:17 2015 UTC,"Probably 0%. He still isn't even old enough to go down to the AHL right now.

EdmontonOilers,3bu2c2,haterbehatin,1 point,Fri Jul 3 01:58:18 2015 UTC,McDavid can't start down there because of the agreement between the NHL and CHL.  McDavid wouldn't be eligible to play for Bakersfield until the Otters season is done but I can't see him not making the Oilers to begin with.
EdmontonOilers,3bu2c2,tsn123456789,2,Fri Jul 3 02:19:39 2015 UTC,No. I don't even remember the last first overall who played in the AHL. Draisaitl is 50/50. Nurse is a safer bet. But a lot is up in the air right now.
EdmontonOilers,3bu2c2,Lemon_Cola,3,Thu Jul 2 03:56:34 2015 UTC,There were Nuge and Hallsy for the lockout but that doesn't really count...
EdmontonOilers,3bu2c2,haterbehatin,3,Thu Jul 2 04:10:03 2015 UTC,I think they were only eligible because they were still on their ELC's but I'm not sure if that applies to all 2 way contracts or just ELC's.

I don't know where what game will be played this preseason, but every season there's a chance. He'll likely never play for the Condors, unless he gets an injury and the staff want him to do a conditioning stint, but that didn't happen to Hall or Nuge when they were injured."

EdmontonOilers,3brq75,IAMA-CANADIAN-AMA,5,Wed Jul 1 17:21:05 2015 UTC,D men start falling off at around 32 (see Bouwmeester)
EdmontonOilers,3brq75,tsn123456789,7,Wed Jul 1 17:21:59 2015 UTC,Yah because bouwmeester dropped off at 32 all defenseman drop off at 32. #logiked.
EdmontonOilers,3brq75,Xx69LeMemer69xX,5,Wed Jul 1 17:30:41 2015 UTC,...I was giving one example. I can give more but I don't have the time to. There's plenty of D who at their mid 30's had their play start to drop off.
EdmontonOilers,3brq75,tsn123456789,6,Wed Jul 1 17:32:10 2015 UTC,"I'm no hockey expert, but I always felt like D men pique later in their careers like goalies."
EdmontonOilers,3brq75,Wickedmoose,2,Wed Jul 1 18:08:49 2015 UTC,Usually their mid to late 20's (obvious exceptions exist like Gio and Chara) while forward usually peak in their early 20's. They can still be serviceable for a longer time than forwards but it doesn't mean age doesn't catch up to them once you hit the mid-30s range.
EdmontonOilers,3brq75,tsn123456789,2,Wed Jul 1 18:11:52 2015 UTC,"Fair enough.  I suppose by the time his contract  runs out, he'll have slowed down, but I'm pretty happy with this for now."
EdmontonOilers,3brq75,Wickedmoose,3,Wed Jul 1 18:22:43 2015 UTC,Forwards peak in early 20 so hall peaked?

And before anyone complains about the money, this is a fantastic deal for us. This isn't an old D-man looking for one last pay day, this is a guy in the prime of his career and he'll only be 35 when the deal ends. Those are prime years for D-men and for a guy who eats 23+ minutes a night, this is a huge pick up for us."
EdmontonOilers,3brq75,Shottaz83,5,Wed Jul 1 16:50:08 2015 UTC,I nearly had a heart attack when I saw we got him. I didn't even think we were close to being in contention!

Now I know there's a subset of Oilers fans who see a 6'3 guy and are upset when he doesn't throw his body around, but that's not a necessary skill to defend.

EdmontonOilers,3brq75,midnightrambler108,2,Wed Jul 1 21:48:39 2015 UTC,"One of the best value contracts in the league.. are you serious? Holy fuck.  edit: to clarify, I don't mind the contract at all, but to say that it is one of the best value contracts in the league is nothing short of absurd. Off the top of my head I could easily rattle off 50 players with contract value better than this."
EdmontonOilers,3brq75,Dallash717,5,Thu Jul 2 00:24:53 2015 UTC,Hmm you're probably right. Perhaps phrase it to one of the best value contacts relative to an unrestricted free agent signing?
EdmontonOilers,3brq75,VanPerstrings,2,Thu Jul 2 00:33:00 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's an important point -- it's an excellent contract from a UFA point of view -- compared to contracts like Roman Josi's or TJ Brodie's, maybe not as much."

Then they were mad that this team wasn't amazing leading into free agency and were angry that Chiarelli wasn't broadcasting his intentions through the media.   He works differently than MacT.

EdmontonOilers,3brq75,Giggleplex,10,Wed Jul 1 17:28:58 2015 UTC,Two years of Nikitin was two too many.
EdmontonOilers,3brq75,paul-mccartney,-2,Wed Jul 1 17:37:59 2015 UTC,"Pretty steep overpayment, imo. But that's the nature of the beast when it comes to July 1st. Always got to overpay for UFA's."
EdmontonOilers,3brq75,ProfessorScribbles,8,Wed Jul 1 16:50:01 2015 UTC,How much of a overpayment do you think this is? He got the same as Petry and most people think he's worth it and they have a pretty comparable game.
EdmontonOilers,3brq75,paul-mccartney,-6,Wed Jul 1 16:53:34 2015 UTC,"I guess that ""steep"" was a bit inaccurate. He's got decent possession stats so I suppose I can stomach it for now. Still think overpayment by at least $1 million though.  He's going to be expected to log A LOT of minutes and I just don't know if he's going to be up for it.  In Carolina, he got to play behind Faulk and Liles. In Buffalo, he was behind Myers and Leopold. Edmonton is going to be a different beast and if he's still in the 3-4 hole. Well then, we overpaid."
EdmontonOilers,3brq75,tsn123456789,7,Wed Jul 1 17:07:20 2015 UTC,"Not sure why you're so caught up in the salary. The cap will go up in 3 years. The main issue is the term which is 1-2 years too long but that's a problem 3-4 years from now.   In Carolina, he got to play behind Faulk and Liles. In Buffalo, he was behind Myers and Leopold. Edmonton is going to be a different beast and if he's still in the 3-4 hole. Well then, we overpaid.   I'm not sure where you got that from. He led the Canes in TOI/G in 13-14 and 3rd in EV TOI/G (by like 40s). He was second last year in EV TOI/G (also by around 40s). He got sheltered in LA, not with the Canes. Liles played a solid 3min less than he did. I don't see how his time with Buffalo is relevant here. He's also a year removed from scoring 44pts.  Edit: He was 2nd in minutes in EVTOI in Bufallo and 1.5min above Myers. Ehrhoff led the team in TOI with 1.5min more."
EdmontonOilers,3brq75,haterbehatin,1 point,Wed Jul 1 17:14:20 2015 UTC,"I think the NMC with the term is a bit of a concern but realistically that's what it took to get him and I think it's worth it.  Worst case scenario they have to convince him to leave in a few years if Nurse, Klefbom and Reinhart all take off and command big money."
EdmontonOilers,3brq75,tsn123456789,3,Wed Jul 1 17:37:33 2015 UTC,"Yes the NMC is the main concern; i'll have to see how the contract is structured (ie NMC only in some years and declining salary would benefit us). My impression is that Klefbom will be signed long term to a cheaper AAV this summer, that leaves Nurse in 3 years and Reinhart in 2 years. I think both need another year in the AHL so the next contract are likely bridges unless they make a quantum leap in development."
EdmontonOilers,3brq75,haterbehatin,1 point,Wed Jul 1 18:02:52 2015 UTC,Yeah I thought that too about those guys starting in Bakersfield.  I think it goes back to that philosophy they were talking about years ago with guys having to fight their way into the lineup.
EdmontonOilers,3brq75,paul-mccartney,-1,Wed Jul 1 18:30:18 2015 UTC,"I don't see how you can just brush off ""that's a problem for 3-4 years from now."" The decisions that we make TODAY absolutely affect us 3-4 year from now.  When McDavid is done his ELC and asking for 9 million a year, combined with prepping to re-sign Hall, Eberle, Nuge, Nurse, etc. This is the sort of contract we're going to look at and go ""Hmmm...""  1 year removed from a 44 point season? He's also 0 years removed from a 23 point season. The rest of his career indicates he's closer to a 23 point guy than a 44 point guy."

The decisions that we make TODAY absolutely affect us 3-4 year from now.   Huh? I even said in my post that the issue is the term because you are the one who didn't even consider it as an issue (focusing on AAV instead). I didn't brush anything off. But I think a 5 year deal is fair for him, so I'm not going to bitch over an extra year. Of course it's a problem, but my point is that it's not as big a problem as you seem to make it. Worst case scenario we package a pick to move his contract.    When McDavid is done his ELC and asking for 9 million a year, combined with prepping to re-sign Hall, Eberle, Nuge, Nurse, etc. This is the sort of contract we're going to look at and go ""Hmmm...""   Did you look at our cap situation at all?   http://stats.nhlnumbers.com/teams/EDM?expand=true&year=2016  In three years Ebs is one year removed from his contract and Hall two years removed. Neither guy is going to need new deals when McDavid's contract is up. Nurse hasn't even started his ELC yet and typically RFA D gets a bridge; even Dougie who most thought was getting 7.3 only got a 5.75x6 so even if Nurse blows our minds off he likely will sign a reasonable long term deal. Sekera is only signed one year past Hall and expires with Nuge. Also keep in mind the cap going up and if you do a trend projection the 7.6% cap of Sekera's contract will probably fall to around 5% so it won't kill us as long as he's a roster player.  We currently have 20M of cap space needing to sign Schultz and Pitlick (before the FA signings so far). This is with 4 cap anchors (Ference, Nikitin, Purcell, Korpikoski) on this team. Subtract those guys we open up 14M. I'm not exactly sure why people think we're screwed cap wise. Even if we are we can easily move Eberle and get a decent return.    1 year removed from a 44 point season? He's also 0 years removed from a 23 point season. The rest of his career indicates he's closer to a 23 point guy than a 44 point guy.   Or..he's somewhere in between, a 30-35 point guy. If you're going to use the career argument then Petry in your mind must be a terrible D, because by your logic he should be closer to his earlier years than later years. D men develop late, the later years are a more accurate indication. Besides, you completely changed your point; your original argument was that he can't handle the big minutes because he was sheltered; this wasn't the case at all."

Show me the calculations that you can't fit McDavid's 9M figure into our cap space 3 years from now because of Sekera's 5.5M deal. We can fit McDavid at 9M right now if we package a few picks to ship out Purcell and Nikitin. Worst case scenario you eat some of Sekera's deal in a buyout if he absolutely cannot stay on the NHL ice. 5-7.6% of your cap hit isn't going to cripple your team, not sure where you're getting the impression otherwise. There's tons of bad contracts that's been moved. Boston and CHI are getting screwed because they have multiple guys on bad deals AND NMC/NTC plus they view their guys as assets. We only have two NMC and one is Ference who expires before McDavid.   You used a lot of words to say absolutely nothing at all. Congratulations.   You're the one who didn't do his own research.

The price is great but the term is terrible for us and shows Chia really hasn't learnt from his Boston days. By ~2020 we are going to be right straight fucked concerning cap  and we're going to end up giving up a 26 year old Reinhart or 24 year old Nurse or 26 year old  Klefbom because we're contractually obligated to.keep a 34 year old Sekera.  Great. We'll win one cup and then flame out. Call me selfish but I'm hoping for more of a Chicago scenario. You don't build dynasties by giving 29 year old non core pieces six year NMC's. Who knows, hopefully Sekera is better than Reinhart or Klefbom until his mid thirties otherwise we just set ourselves up for a Boychuck just to get into the playoffs as soon as possible.  Edit: I'm super happy with Sekera now I just don't think any of us will be happy with him in 4 years."
EdmontonOilers,3brq75,koho_66,4,Wed Jul 1 17:51:43 2015 UTC,"Yup term is a big deal plus the NMC. Good thing about MacT/Howson is that he didn't hand out NMCs like candy like Chia did. One NMC isn't going to kill us, it's multiple NMCs plus overpaid guys, so hopefully MacT can hold Chia back from handing those out. I would like to see the contract structure, maybe it's a declining salary scale with NMCs at the beginning (like Dubnyk's contract, designed to be traded at the end). This is deal is far better to me than moving Marincin for Gryba.  I'm not too concerned about Reinhart and Nurse, it will be 2 years and 3 years respectively for the two and the cap will have gone up by then and both will likely get bridges unless they blow our minds off (meaning we'd likely be contenders).  Regardless we needed to bring in somebody and if you want a guy to eat minutes he won't be cheap. It's tough to not overpay if you dip into the UFA market. One bad contract isn't going to cripple us (makes life difficult yes). It didn't even cripple Boston, they had room for Dougie. PIT still added Kessel for scraps. CHI was the exception but that was their own stupidity for not moving Sharp quicker."

EdmontonOilers,3brq75,HarfNarfArf,1 point,Thu Jul 2 00:21:40 2015 UTC,If the cap crunch comes we could always trade Sekera and include a draft pick to get him off our hands. One silver lining about playing in Edmonton is that well... I imagine a lot of players don't have any qualms about moving to a bigger american city. Now Im not saying that Edm is a crap hole but a lot of players wouldnt mind going to Nyc or a warmer city. As for Sekera at at 35 he should still just... be effective. Sure he could have a drop off but most defencemen seem to hang on till at least 35.
EdmontonOilers,3brq75,Ferocian,0,Thu Jul 2 01:17:04 2015 UTC,Tweet from Elliotte.   https://twitter.com/friedgehnic/status/616285912167804928
EdmontonOilers,3brq75,AlleyBj,0,Wed Jul 1 16:45:39 2015 UTC,"How much does which side they shoot from factor into it? This is yet another left shot defenseman. Almost every good D we have shoots left. Is it as easy for a D to play on the right when they're a left shot as it is for a forward?   I mean Nurse, Ference, Reinhart, Sekera, Klefbom, Nikitin all shoot left. Only Gryba, Fayne and Schultz shoot right. That's a pretty weak right side if they all play the side they shoot on compared to the left."
EdmontonOilers,3brq75,haterbehatin,5,Wed Jul 1 17:25:22 2015 UTC,"A few of those players (Nurse, Klefbom and Reinhart) have all said that they can play both sides with no real problem. Reinhart played it in the AHL and Nurse played the right side during the World Juniors."
EdmontonOilers,3brq75,Spoonfeedme,1 point,Wed Jul 1 17:37:40 2015 UTC,"Nurse played the right side with the Barons as well.  I thought Theodore played the right side at the World Jr's with Nurse, I could be misremembering though."
EdmontonOilers,3brq75,Ferocian,2,Thu Jul 2 03:49:17 2015 UTC,The real challenge is allocation/cycling of pucks. A LH defenseman on the right point is better for ripping pucks but way worse for holding the line.
EdmontonOilers,3btuis,Shottaz83,8,Thu Jul 2 02:38:22 2015 UTC,so fun to watch how many awesome people are part of the organization now and are happy to be a part of it #tingles

EdmontonOilers,3brqea,IGetComputersPuting,7,Fri Jul 3 00:29:03 2015 UTC,Chia is on fucking fire! He also chose us over 3 other teams!
EdmontonOilers,3brqea,Shottaz83,5,Wed Jul 1 17:11:06 2015 UTC,If what the CBJ fans are saying is true we basically just gave Gordon 1.2 paycut and got a Korpeedo.
EdmontonOilers,3brqea,HarfNarfArf,5,Wed Jul 1 17:08:17 2015 UTC,For sure. Chia pulled a stunner here. Watched a bit of Letestu last season and he's a very hard working player.
EdmontonOilers,3brqea,notsoyoungpadawan,4,Wed Jul 1 17:11:43 2015 UTC,Holy shit that's cheap
EdmontonOilers,3brqea,Eyo27,1 point,Wed Jul 1 17:07:36 2015 UTC,"Shit, that is good value. Nice signing."
EdmontonOilers,3brqea,OdinPBH,18,Wed Jul 1 17:58:07 2015 UTC,Letestu is a better player than Gordon now IMO.     52% on the dot.
EdmontonOilers,3brqea,VanPerstrings,21,Wed Jul 1 16:50:50 2015 UTC,he's basically Gordon in his prime
EdmontonOilers,3brqea,tsn123456789,5,Wed Jul 1 16:53:40 2015 UTC,Yup. Here's a breakdown of his stats (including faceoffs): http://faceoffs.net/player/mark-letestu  Very good pick up. Could put up some good points for a 3/4th line C. We have excellent C depth now. Chia working his magic.
EdmontonOilers,3brqea,notsoyoungpadawan,9,Wed Jul 1 16:56:55 2015 UTC,A lot of us were pretty sad/mad to see Gordon go but this makes it better.
EdmontonOilers,3brqea,AlleyBj,5,Wed Jul 1 17:38:18 2015 UTC,"He's younger, cheaper , and with way-way-way more offensive upside. Think the pre-interview went well enough for Chiarelli to think a deal was pretty much confirmed. Imagine if we waited until after this deal to trade Gordon - we'd get absolutely nothing."
EdmontonOilers,3brqea,AlleyBj,7,Wed Jul 1 17:50:54 2015 UTC,"Agreed. Chiarelli did a really great job flipping Gordon for a younger, more offensive one plus a 3/4 LW."
EdmontonOilers,3brqea,9Bains,9,Wed Jul 1 18:06:07 2015 UTC,"weaker in the dot, but a lot more offense. Good pick up."
EdmontonOilers,3brqea,haterbehatin,6,Wed Jul 1 17:07:39 2015 UTC,"Based on last year their PPG are fairly close but if people are right about him being injured and he bounces back this year, he's does bring a ton more offense."
EdmontonOilers,3brqea,9Bains,2,Wed Jul 1 17:11:55 2015 UTC,"less than half his previous weakest season (11-12) I think its true. Need to check his QualComp, see what type of players to expect to see him line up against"
EdmontonOilers,3brqea,haterbehatin,2,Wed Jul 1 17:29:50 2015 UTC,"Yeup .40 ppg with Pittsburgh and Columbus, then he put up .47, .59 and .41 before his dip this year.   Maybe his usage changed a bit this year too with Anisimov and Jenner?  Either way he seems to add a lot of flexibility and at a great price."
EdmontonOilers,3brqea,MrSlipp,3,Wed Jul 1 18:31:24 2015 UTC,still +50%. 52% is nothing to sneeze at.
EdmontonOilers,3brqea,9Bains,2,Wed Jul 1 17:57:14 2015 UTC,"no, absolutely not. 52% is impressive, but what Gordon did best was play the toughest guys and the toughest zone starts, and I don't know if Letestu can do that for us. Still great pick up, still love the deal."
EdmontonOilers,3brqea,tsn123456789,2,Wed Jul 1 18:14:28 2015 UTC,I wouldn't trust last years numbers for any CBJ player outside their top line. That team was banged up real bad and had half their AHL team in their lineup for most of the year. His previous years numbers put him at a 20-30pt guy and play Gordon's game defensively and on the dot.
EdmontonOilers,3brqea,9Bains,2,Wed Jul 1 18:36:53 2015 UTC,"He got the toughest ZS, but not the toughest competition. Ignoring last year he gets a bit of everyone it seems."
EdmontonOilers,3brqea,paul-mccartney,5,Wed Jul 1 18:50:12 2015 UTC,Big fan of this signing. Good Tarawna boy. (or the Alberta equivalent)  Should slide right into the 4C spot that Gordon left. Do you guys think that Lander can handle being #3C?
EdmontonOilers,3brqea,TheTravellingMan,6,Wed Jul 1 17:55:06 2015 UTC,Lander will be a good 3C he's responsible enough on D but still able to provide a bit of offence. The question now is how we organize our bottom 6.
EdmontonOilers,3brqea,crazycatman69,3,Wed Jul 1 18:26:56 2015 UTC,Can anyone give me a report on him? What type of player he is?
EdmontonOilers,3brqea,HORSEtheGAME,4,Wed Jul 1 16:48:03 2015 UTC,Responsible 4th line center. Low cap hit.  EDIT: 1.8m AAV  https://twitter.com/TSNRyanRishaug/status/616289280512688128
EdmontonOilers,3brqea,tsn123456789,-2,Wed Jul 1 16:49:13 2015 UTC,"AAV not confirmed, would not be surprised if it's 3M"
EdmontonOilers,3brqea,HORSEtheGAME,2,Wed Jul 1 16:52:23 2015 UTC,"Yeah I was just assuming it would be low. On CBJ it was like 1.25, and he is already 30 years old."

EdmontonOilers,3brqea,haterbehatin,2,Wed Jul 1 16:58:16 2015 UTC,Looks like two good signings to me.
EdmontonOilers,3brqea,justthetip751,2,Wed Jul 1 17:10:20 2015 UTC,"Columbus fan here. He's a good player who, when paired with the right guys, can put the puck away. Good pick up on your part, because I sure am sad to see him go."
EdmontonOilers,3brqea,ranatalus,2,Wed Jul 1 23:30:39 2015 UTC,"CBJ fan here. Important thing to note about Letestu is that his most frequent linemates 5v5 were Jared Boll and Corey Tropp and they absolutely dragged him down. His CF% dropped 10% when he was on the ice with Boll, and 15% when he was on the ice with Tropp.  Paired with bottom 6 guys who can actually play hockey, Letestu is a possession driver and can easily put up 10G, 30P. You guys are getting a real solid player."
EdmontonOilers,3brqea,ProfessorScribbles,1 point,Thu Jul 2 14:27:44 2015 UTC,"No word on cap hit yet, speculation was 3 million.  Not really sure how I feel about this signing, I don't know anything about Letestu."
EdmontonOilers,3brqea,HarfNarfArf,6,Wed Jul 1 16:48:44 2015 UTC,I know Columbus really liked him as a good 4C and people hoped he'd resign after Anisimov was shipped.
EdmontonOilers,3brqea,ProfessorScribbles,2,Wed Jul 1 16:49:57 2015 UTC,"That inspires a bit of confidence, then. If we get him for the same as Boyd or less then we basically robbed Arizona."

EdmontonOilers,3btiaf,Shottaz83,3,Thu Jul 2 00:58:55 2015 UTC,He's clearly having a terrible time. We should trade him for some team's worst player in a one for one. That'll fix him!
EdmontonOilers,3btiaf,ProfessorScribbles,3,Thu Jul 2 02:43:39 2015 UTC,That new stick of his is going to be as iconic as Ovi's laces.

EdmontonOilers,3bsq2s,stelts94,1 point,Thu Jul 2 21:56:24 2015 UTC,I like Pouliot with Connor just cause he's older. I guess it doesn't really make a huge difference but that was my thought process.
EdmontonOilers,3bsq2s,AlleyBj,1 point,Thu Jul 2 21:59:42 2015 UTC,You don't think Drai cracks the lineup this year?
EdmontonOilers,3bsq2s,Robbap,3,Thu Jul 2 02:21:37 2015 UTC,"At this point no, but if he does I wouldn't be sad about it. If we could deal Purcell or flip Korp I could see Drai taking the wing next to Lander.  I really like that 4th line because last year the wagon line was great and Letestu more or less =/= Gordon so it should be great once again. Plus, I'd much rather see Drai playing 17+ minutes in the AHL than playing 8 or so on our 4th line. The same applies for Nurse."
EdmontonOilers,3bsq2s,AlleyBj,9,Thu Jul 2 02:33:34 2015 UTC,"As an aside, I have to say we seem like one of the most level headed subs on /r/hockey. Not sure if thats because of the mods or because our years of sucking have weeded out all the bandwagon jumpers and fair weather fans. I went over to the Bruins sub and tons of ppl ate up that shit about Hamilton being a locker room cancer let alone understand the true value of a young stud #1 D. Then I went to the leafs sub and ppl losing their minds that Maatta wasnt included with the Kessel deal, a huge bloated contract was taken on the by the Penguins why would they toss in their best young D on a value contract?"
EdmontonOilers,3bsq2s,Colotech,6,Thu Jul 2 00:14:38 2015 UTC,Bruins fans aren't the most polished to begin with. And Leafs fans are generally as uneducated about other teams as their local media.
EdmontonOilers,3bsq2s,notsoyoungpadawan,5,Thu Jul 2 00:33:44 2015 UTC,"Interesting observation of the day:   Oilers sign Benoit Pouliot for 5 years @ $4M and gets shat on by /r/hockey  Flames sign Michael Frolik for 5 years @ $4.3M and gets praise heaped upon them.   I am so glad the ""Oilers can't do anything right!"" circlejerk on /r/hockey is slowing down."
EdmontonOilers,3bsq2s,notsoyoungpadawan,5,Thu Jul 2 00:06:20 2015 UTC,"The general consensus of the hockey world (and just all of sports in general) will never align itself with the factual truth simply because they base all of their opinions on what the media feeds them.   Only reason they're moving away from the ""Oilers can't do anything right"" rhetoric is because the media is saying it too."

EdmontonOilers,3bsq2s,notsoyoungpadawan,2,Thu Jul 2 00:06:19 2015 UTC,Exactly!! This is exactly what I noticed too. Glad he's already on board.
EdmontonOilers,3bsq2s,haterbehatin,3,Thu Jul 2 00:35:12 2015 UTC,I like the idea of the defense being deep enough that Reinhart and Nurse are forced to start in Bakersfield next year unless they force their way onto the roster.  What I don't like is that it's not unreasonable to think that they'll both belong on the roster next year and Ference seems like he'll be in the way.
EdmontonOilers,3bsq2s,arcticcatherder,2,Wed Jul 1 22:29:48 2015 UTC,"Ference has a NMC, right? I think he'd be easier to move but if he has that, then that would be problematic."
EdmontonOilers,3bsq2s,haterbehatin,1 point,Wed Jul 1 22:45:34 2015 UTC,Yeah he's not that NMC so it'll take some kind of convincing to get him to move on.   Maybe he's in the plans for this year and then they explore their options from there?
EdmontonOilers,3bsq2s,arcticcatherder,2,Wed Jul 1 23:07:32 2015 UTC,"Could be. How long is left on his contract? It's still a long while isn't it. I know he really likes it here, he has his family, and now CSP is here. I can't see him wanting to move."
EdmontonOilers,3bsq2s,haterbehatin,2,Wed Jul 1 23:18:23 2015 UTC,Just two years but I'm thinking by that 2nd year Reinhart and Nurse should both be ready to be Oilers and their likely won't be room for him or at least their hopefully won't be room for him.
EdmontonOilers,3bsq2s,arcticcatherder,2,Wed Jul 1 23:21:20 2015 UTC,It's too bad really. The guy is awesome but he just can't keep up anymore. Nikitin will be difficult to move. I heard there's another window for buyout if they bring Shultz to arbitration? I wonder if that will happen then.
EdmontonOilers,3bsq2s,haterbehatin,2,Wed Jul 1 23:30:21 2015 UTC,"Yeah it's not too bad it's just I'm not sure how well he fits.  This year I can see it if it's something like  Sekera-Fayne  Klefbom-Schultz  Ference-Gryba  But by next year assuming Reinhart and Nurse are ready:  Sekera-Fayne  Klefbom- Nurse/Schultz  Reinhart/Nurse- Schultz/Nurse/Reinhart   depending on how they slot, I just don't see where Ference fits in year two.  Even if Schultz gets moved at some point they're still going to need someone better than Ference to complete that d, even as it is it relies pretty heavily on all Nurse, Klefbom and Reinhart taking big leaps as well as Schultz if he's still an Oiler."
EdmontonOilers,3bsq2s,arcticcatherder,2,Thu Jul 2 00:39:20 2015 UTC,"Could they just push Nikitin down on waivers or something? I mean, that's probably crappy but just trying to think what options they might have. They can't do that with Ference though."
EdmontonOilers,3bsq2s,haterbehatin,2,Thu Jul 2 00:44:25 2015 UTC,Yeah they could put him on waivers and send him to Bakersfield if he clears or depending on what they choose to do with Reinhart or if they add another defenseman they could just have him be the 7th defenseman and then maybe trade him midway through the year if another team needs a defenseman.

EdmontonOilers,3bsq2s,tsn123456789,2,Wed Jul 1 22:31:37 2015 UTC,No he's not an NHL level goalie but does have potential. At the draft he was very highly touted (as much as Gibson) and was picked one pick before Gibson. Had a bad year the year before but rebounded this year. His first two pro years were solid. Him and Broissoit would've made a good tandem in OKC. I remember recommending looking at him as an option on goaltending for the farm yesterday. Nashville is too deep in net and have Saros coming in so he got forced out.  Not sure about waiver eligibility.

EdmontonOilers,3bsq2s,DocDiggler,6,Wed Jul 1 22:11:41 2015 UTC,The intensity of Drai and McDavid along with the confidence of Nurse with the potential of Chase. That's it I think. It's fucking gorgeous.
EdmontonOilers,3bsq2s,notsoyoungpadawan,2,Wed Jul 1 22:26:13 2015 UTC,Don't forget Platzer. Another player with a ton of potential.
EdmontonOilers,3bsq2s,shweet44722,2,Wed Jul 1 22:29:22 2015 UTC,I gotta throw Yakimov and Slepyshev in there. I've come to love our Russian prospects.
EdmontonOilers,3bsq2s,notsoyoungpadawan,2,Thu Jul 2 07:08:12 2015 UTC,"Oh yes, definitely. Really excited about Slepyshev personally. Yak2 has kind of taken a step back because of his injury unfortunately. But Slepyshev is hopefully going to be epic."
EdmontonOilers,3bsq2s,shweet44722,1 point,Thu Jul 2 07:28:03 2015 UTC,"True, but when he was playing in the 2nd half of the season, and healthy, he played much better than he did in the first half, which is reassuring.  Can't wait to watch them. Add in the potential for Reinhart, Draisaitl and Nurse to be in Bakersfield depending on how camp goes and that could be one hell of a damn good AHL team."
EdmontonOilers,3bsq2s,Shottaz83,23,Thu Jul 2 07:47:31 2015 UTC,"And this is why people need to calm down when trades are made. When Gordo got traded yesterday people completely freaked out. You need to trust our management now. I know its difficult with what we've been through the past 9 years, but you need to trust them. They have a plan in place, and they're executing it. Let them get to the start of the season before freaking out."
EdmontonOilers,3bsq2s,haterbehatin,6,Wed Jul 1 21:45:59 2015 UTC,"You need to trust our management now   Why?  I like both signings today, that doesn't mean I have to like all of his moves and act like he's infallible.   Sometimes mangers make good moves and sometimes they make bad moves, making good moves doesn't turn bad moves into good moves."
EdmontonOilers,3bsq2s,HarfNarfArf,3,Wed Jul 1 22:21:40 2015 UTC,"For me, whether I trust Chiarelli or not is irrelevant. I have trust in the fact that he and his cohorts have an actual plan, and I have trust in the fact that Chiarelli is a guy who can, has, and judging by this past week or so, just did evaluate the areas of weakness and need that an NHL level club has in terms of player personnel, and is capable of going out and addressing those needs (individual piece judgement withheld until games are played, of course). That is one thing I feel hasn't really been done competently for the past decade.   For the first time in a long time, I feel the club has a solid plan, as opposed to just band aids for when problems appear. So again, my feelings on Chiarelli don't matter, but the sense I have seen in his moves thus far indicate that he is assembling a cohesive team that the likes of MacTavish and co did not really come close to building, and I wasn't exactly a MacTavish hater."
EdmontonOilers,3bsq2s,haterbehatin,1 point,Thu Jul 2 00:29:28 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure it's necessarily fair to say MacT didn't do that though.   This roster is in a much different position this offseason than it's ever been.   It's a lot easier to identify needs and try to address them when you have 3 major team needs, two top 4 defense and a starting goaltender vs 5,6,7 plus needs as the team has had in previous years.   Credit to Chiarelli that he's filled two of those needs and added another maybe if Reinhart produces right away he's filled all the team needs plus some side moves that put his own stamp on the team.  I just don't think it's as easy of a comparison as you're making it seem."
EdmontonOilers,3bsq2s,arcticcatherder,2,Thu Jul 2 02:44:09 2015 UTC,"Agreed. It's way too soon for me to trust him yet. Has Chia brought me back some hope? Yes. Do I trust him yet? Nope. This time next year, if all is proving to be on the upswing, I'll start trusting him. I am not expecting the Oilers to miraculously be playoff bound even if I did have 100% faith in him. So I don't have crazy expectations either. But once I see real results on the ice, THEN I can start trusting them."
EdmontonOilers,3bsq2s,Shottaz83,9,Wed Jul 1 22:51:17 2015 UTC,"I'm not saying you need to like all of his moves, because thats unrealistic. But you need to give the management group a chance. The team hasn't even played a game yet. We're still over 3 months away. Wait to pass judgment until we actually see the team play, and how the players he acquired perform."
EdmontonOilers,3bsq2s,haterbehatin,1 point,Wed Jul 1 22:38:53 2015 UTC,"If I think it's a good move I call it a good move if it's a bad move I say it's a bad move, sometimes I'm right, sometimes I'm wrong.   If I call one of his moves shit and it turns out to be great for the team, I'm happy to be wrong but I don't think that should prevent me from having an opinion until months into the season."

EdmontonOilers,3bsq2s,shweet44722,10,Wed Jul 1 21:36:23 2015 UTC,"Sekera: The money is about what he was going to get, if not a little less than expected, and the term is okay for a Dman who is entering his prime years. He's solid defensively, has a great shot and can still produce some points. Good pickup. Koripikoski: Eeeeh. Not my favourite pickup. He's likely a 3LW and 2.5M is a lot of money for him. It's only 2 years, and I'm guessing Chia wanted to bring him in as a more experience forward. He's 6'1, so big but not overly so. Idk, it's kind of a ""meh"" signing for me personally. Letestu: Fantastic! A younger, more offensive Gordon at 1.8M for 3 years? Job well done Chia.   Overall I'd say today was solid. Fuck the Flames for picking up Frolik and re-signing Ramo. Flames have apparently decided they don't want to be the Avs next year."
EdmontonOilers,3bsq2s,notsoyoungpadawan,3,Wed Jul 1 21:36:21 2015 UTC,"I like what Chia said there, ""The off season is a lot different to the first 10 games of the season, and that's a lot different to the next 10 games of the season""..

EdmontonOilers,3bsq2s,YAK_ATTACK_CALL_911,6,Wed Jul 1 21:24:40 2015 UTC,Doubtful. You don't bring in a coach like TMac and then make the decisions for him.

EdmontonOilers,3bsq2s,eatingasspatties,3,Wed Jul 1 21:11:46 2015 UTC,"Who would ference waive his NMC for? Boston maybe he loves it there but left to sign in his home town. I honestly don't think Ference would waive for anywhere, we might have to just buy him out."
EdmontonOilers,3bsq2s,arcticcatherder,1 point,Wed Jul 1 21:30:28 2015 UTC,"Yeah that's an issue, I thought it wasn't a full NMC though, just one where he has a list of ten teams or so. I would hate to buy him out, but I really have no idea how many teams are out there that want him and that he would want to go to."
EdmontonOilers,3bu26c,NO_NAME_BRAN,7,Thu Jul 2 03:51:50 2015 UTC,"Well first of all, we're not moving Draisaitl for Phaneuf or Lupul, especially seeing the return Kessel got  Our lines will probably be:  Pouliot - RNH - Eberle  Hall - McDavid - Yakupov  Draisaitl/Korpikoski/Pitlick - Lander - Purcelll  Hendricks/Korpikoski - Letestu - Klinkhammer/Gazdic  Bottom six has a lot of moving parts. Draisaitl IMO should start in the AHL. Pitlick doesn't really fit the 3rd line. I really don't like Korpikoski there either but he has the most offensive upside if Drai is down."

EdmontonOilers,3bu26c,haterbehatin,2,Thu Jul 2 04:01:12 2015 UTC,A deal based around Rielly for Draisaitl would be great for the Oilers.
EdmontonOilers,3bu26c,tsn123456789,5,Thu Jul 2 04:42:55 2015 UTC,Problem is he's another leftie and Toronto would never ever let him go
EdmontonOilers,3bu26c,haterbehatin,2,Thu Jul 2 05:12:11 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I don't think they'd let him go either, the lefty part maybe isin't too huge of deal and he would bring the type offense the team could really use."
EdmontonOilers,3bu26c,AlleyBj,3,Thu Jul 2 05:14:07 2015 UTC,"Pouliot - Nuge - Eberle  Hall - McDavid - Yakupov  Korpikoski* - Lander - Purcell  Hendricks - Letestu - Klinkhammer  Sekera - Fayne  Klef - Schultz  Ference* - Reinhart  Talbot - Scrivens  *if Drai makes it out of camp i'd like him to go there. If Nurse does, I'd like him to replace Schultz and move Schultz down (Reinhart - Schultz)"
EdmontonOilers,3bu26c,ProfessorScribbles,3,Thu Jul 2 05:31:06 2015 UTC,"I think the Korpikoski trade was designed to both save a little cap and to force Drai to stay in the AHL. Look at our forward core, and you can see exactly zero spots open for young guys who could probably use more time in the minors.  Let him get seasoning down there, then when someone gets hurt he can be the first call up and he can dominate."
EdmontonOilers,3bu26c,LuckyCanuck13,3,Thu Jul 2 08:23:08 2015 UTC,"Not to be a total homer but if we're moving Drai it would be for a Rielly type player, young first pairing dman. Sure we'd have to add a bit, but Drai has the makings of a #1C. You don't just give those away. It's more likely we keep him and either next year trade one of them. I'm half hoping for an RNH/Seth Jones trade.  As for line ups I can see this:  (copied from tsn guy below as i agree with nearly all of it)  Pouliot - RNH - Eberle  Hall - McDavid - Yakupov  Draisaitl/Korpikoski - Lander - Purcell  Hendricks/Korpikoski - Letestu - Klinkhammer/Pitlick    Sekera- Fayne (he is our best defensive right D)  Klefbom -Schultz (Klef is the only one I trust to keep Schultz useful)  Ference- Reinhart     Talbot  Scrivens    However in my ideal world I'd have the defense look differently:  Sekera- Klef (has played right side in the past)  Nurse- Fayne  Ehrhoff (I want another German okay?)- Reinhart/Schultz"
EdmontonOilers,3bu26c,haterbehatin,1 point,Thu Jul 2 04:21:55 2015 UTC,"I think that's a pretty realistic lineup although I think if the Oilers d is made up of the group it is now, I'd rather see Reinhart and Nurse start off as Condors unless they have a monster camp."
EdmontonOilers,3bu26c,LuckyCanuck13,2,Thu Jul 2 04:41:43 2015 UTC,"I'll be honest, I included Reinhart mostly because I'm not sold on Gryba being better than Reinhart on the right side."
EdmontonOilers,3bu26c,haterbehatin,1 point,Thu Jul 2 05:06:11 2015 UTC,"I don't really like the Gryba deal or Gryba at all, I'm just thinking it might be better for him and Nurse to play more minutes in the AHL and then force their way onto the roster.   Nurse was the first guy I thought of when Chiarelli said there were some guys who might not start with us but might finish with us. Seems like Reinhart could be in that group as well."

I hope that McDavid plays on the Ebs line just because I want to shelter him a little bit and I wanted to change it up from what everyone else was saying. I put Leon and Nurse in the minors to begin with because it cant hurt and they are honestly somewhat log jammed behind older players"
EdmontonOilers,3bu26c,ABirdOfParadise,1 point,Thu Jul 2 15:17:38 2015 UTC,"What I wanted  Pouliot - RNH - Eberle  Hall - McDavid - Yakupov  Tlusty - Lander - Comeau/Frolik  Hendy - Gordon - Klinkhammer  Martin/Sekera - Franson/Green  Klefbom - Fayne  Ference - Gryba  Nurse - Schultz  Talbot - Scrivens  What I hope we will still have  Pouliot - RNH - Eberle  Hall - McDavid - Yakupov  Tlusty - Roy (really cheap)/Lander - Lander/Erat (really cheap)/Pitlick/Okposo  Hendy - Letestu - Klinkhammer  Korpikoski extra  Sekera - Franson  Klefbom - Fayne  Ference - Gryba  Nurse AHL - Schultz extra  Talbot - Scrivens  Basically if we can get Roy cheap put Lander on the wing, if we can get Erat cheap forget Roy, if you can't get either slap in Pitlick, if you can get Okposo via trade then do that instead of any of the aforementioned things.   Schultz/Gryba are the extra D, Nurse can be the call up, Drai, or any other rookie has to earn his spot and the spot he takes becomes an extra forward."

EdmontonOilers,3briqd,CrimsonScars,1 point,Thu Jul 2 01:50:38 2015 UTC,If the price on Franson is down enough in both AAV and term he could be a good addition.  Sekera-Franson  Klefbom-Schultz  Ference- Fayne  Nikitin- Gryba   Would have a very nice mix of offense and defense.
EdmontonOilers,3briqd,haterbehatin,2,Thu Jul 2 05:17:36 2015 UTC,I am right there - Franson would add much needed depth and secondary scoring.  Which also leaves it open to making a trade involing say Nikitin (would have to eat some salary is my guess.)
EdmontonOilers,3briqd,putzeh,1 point,Thu Jul 2 14:30:21 2015 UTC,"I'm wondering too if since he didn't go day 1 maybe the price would be a little lower.  If they could grab him for say 4 years and an AAV anywhere from 4 to the 5.5 Petry got he'd be a nice add, I think he if he wanted more money and term (particularly term) he's probably not worth it though."
EdmontonOilers,3briqd,haterbehatin,2,Thu Jul 2 15:09:04 2015 UTC,"at 27, I would be happy with 4 years at 4/4.5.  He gets overlooked due to his foot speed, but he hardly gets beat one on one. Plays the body."
EdmontonOilers,3briqd,putzeh,1 point,Thu Jul 2 15:23:13 2015 UTC,"His foot speed would definitely be a concern but I think on a short term deal he should be alright, he'd be a big power play addition and Chiarelli would love him because he's big and throws the body around.   I would love him because it should mean Gryba being a healthy scratch on a regular basis at least I would hope they'd go with a right side of Franson, Schultz and Fayne."

EdmontonOilers,3briqd,notsoyoungpadawan,1 point,Wed Jul 1 20:12:50 2015 UTC,The money will be tough without dumping 2 of Nikitin/Purcell/Ference/Schultz.   I say no to Oduya. His numbers away from Hjalmarsson are pretty terrible and he's at that age where performance drops off a cliff.   Ward was my top choice for a forward but only on a 2 year deal max. Stewart is an interesting idea but he strikes me as Purcell 2.0. Sure he can put up points but we don't need guys coasting out there.

EdmontonOilers,3briqd,plahcinski,2,Wed Jul 1 19:42:54 2015 UTC,Can't tell if they're holding out for big money and are going to get paid or if they're getting squeezed down to levels where they'd be interesting.
EdmontonOilers,3briqd,TweetsInCommentsBot,2,Wed Jul 1 19:21:53 2015 UTC,My guess is the latter. Cap strapped teams not interested in shelling out multiple millions.

EdmontonOilers,3briqd,haterbehatin,1 point,Wed Jul 1 19:16:32 2015 UTC,I would think at least a 2016 2nd and a prospect like Yakimov. Probably closer to a protected 1st.

EdmontonOilers,3briqd,notsoyoungpadawan,1 point,Wed Jul 1 19:16:43 2015 UTC,Yeah I think he's a UFA after this coming season. I'd be a little surprised if they moved him after the big deal to acquire him and they made other moves for cap space but you never know.   He'd be a great puck mover which is definitely needed but I'm not sure if he plays right d or not.

EdmontonOilers,3bqzym,YAK_ATTACK_CALL_911,4,Wed Jul 1 14:52:57 2015 UTC,Hop on the Sekera hype train bro! We have room! ;)
EdmontonOilers,3bqzym,Dr_Marxist,3,Wed Jul 1 15:10:03 2015 UTC,This fence is looking like a good place till something concrete rears its head :)
EdmontonOilers,3bqzym,notsoyoungpadawan,3,Wed Jul 1 15:24:10 2015 UTC,That's fair!
EdmontonOilers,3brd2d,WobblyHobbly,12,Wed Jul 1 15:09:44 2015 UTC,"He had a horrible year last year. So he can only get better, but I wont be too upset if we lose him, if we get Neuvirth in return. I love Scrivvy as a person, he's a great human being, but Hockeys a business, and if you don't play well you get replaced."
EdmontonOilers,3brd2d,Shottaz83,6,Wed Jul 1 15:15:11 2015 UTC,"Toss him outta here like that bum Dubny............. Ohh wait a second. I think the Oilers team/goalie  relationship over the last few years has been a bit of a ""it's me not you"" break up.   I'm okay with giving Scrivens a try on this team with a competent D, competent coaching (both head and goalie). Before we send him off to be another teams Vezina candidate."
EdmontonOilers,3brd2d,Starsky686,3,Wed Jul 1 15:59:43 2015 UTC,I think the whole Dubby think might actually inflate Scrivens value higher than it would otherwise be after last season. Prospective trading partners can still look back to the year he came and see his record setting shutout and get the idea that they can scrub the oil off of him...
EdmontonOilers,3brd2d,nuttybuddy,3,Wed Jul 1 16:37:47 2015 UTC,"True, it would just be a real shame if the team ""scrubbing the oil"" of him was right."
EdmontonOilers,3brd2d,Starsky686,11,Wed Jul 1 17:00:54 2015 UTC,"I hope Scribbles stays. He had a rough year, but what goalie hasn't had a rough stay in Edmonton since Roli?  Beef up the blueline and watch them improve."
EdmontonOilers,3brd2d,YAK_ATTACK_CALL_911,3,Wed Jul 1 15:18:13 2015 UTC,"I hope that he stays. He's got a strong personality and I think that he's really well respected in the locker room.  He's just not a true #1, hopefully Talbot can be that."
EdmontonOilers,3brd2d,paul-mccartney,3,Wed Jul 1 17:56:34 2015 UTC,"If you're filling your roster with prospective goalies who have had good numbers as backups, it's probably a good idea to have 3 of them I figure. When you got a real proven starter who can carry the load with 60 games or so, then you go with 2 goalies."
EdmontonOilers,3brd2d,McEirhead,3,Wed Jul 1 19:07:47 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't be remiss if Scrivens left and we picked up either Ramo or Neuvirth. With that said, Scrivens had a shit year last year but can be a competent backup. He may not be starting material, but he's definitely serviceable as a 2nd goaltender.  Edit: well, never mind about Ramo."
EdmontonOilers,3brd2d,shweet44722,5,Wed Jul 1 19:28:35 2015 UTC,"I don't think Scrivens is a bad goalie. If I recall, he had pretty similar numbers as Talbot before joining the Oilers. If you put a really weak defence in front of any goalie, they are gonna look bad. Hopefully we get a good D-man or two and maybe we won't be giving up so many odd man rushes this year which led to so many goals"
EdmontonOilers,3brd2d,0001000101,7,Wed Jul 1 15:45:39 2015 UTC,I think Scrivens is a decent backup. I'd sooner see him stay than Ferrence.
EdmontonOilers,3brd2d,midnightrambler108,2,Wed Jul 1 15:58:31 2015 UTC,I think they'd be able to flip him to somebody looking for a backup goalie maybe for a third or a 4th or perhaps a depth forward.   Before anyone says the Bruins won't trade with Chiarelli they could be a fit for a guy like Scrivens and Chiarelli probably covets someone like Chris Kelly because he's one of his guys and because there's a vacancy now.
EdmontonOilers,3brd2d,haterbehatin,1 point,Wed Jul 1 15:16:48 2015 UTC,"I like Scrivens, I think that he had a horrendous end to his already awful season, but it makes me think that there is no way he can be as bad as he was this past season. I want to keep him and see if he can improve to what he was capable of in LA again and show that he is a 1B/ good backup that can cover for injured starter. Maybe flip him at the deadline."
EdmontonOilers,3brd2d,9Bains,1 point,Wed Jul 1 15:41:21 2015 UTC,Neuvirth ain't that much better. He certainly isn't worth the salary we pay him + the Scrivens buy-out.
EdmontonOilers,3brd2d,notsoyoungpadawan,1 point,Wed Jul 1 16:00:25 2015 UTC,"Well, the antique name would have to go, but Scrivvy probably isn't our best option and I won't get too choked up about it. :("
EdmontonOilers,3brd2d,ProfessorScribbles,1 point,Wed Jul 1 16:23:28 2015 UTC,"Scrivens is a great guy, and has proven to be a good goaltender in years other than last year.  I want him to stay."
EdmontonOilers,3brd2d,DJ80,1 point,Wed Jul 1 18:42:02 2015 UTC,"If they can upgrade him I expensively, and move him for something back worth having, I wouldn't complain at all. If they can't I wouldn't complain at all. Unless they need the space for something I don't see a massive need to move the guy."
EdmontonOilers,3brd2d,A5hcrack,1 point,Wed Jul 1 19:59:53 2015 UTC,"I think hes a very capable backup and if Talbot were at all proven to be a starter they wouldnt be looking at anyone else, I think the tire kicking was more so the oilers trying to land a plan B in case Talbot doesnt turn out. I hope the best for Scrivens, Id like him to stay, He's a hometown guy that is incredibly passionate about this team and he wants to play here and win here, and after the decade we just had, players like that should be treasured"
EdmontonOilers,3boy3f,YXxACExXY,43,Tue Jun 30 23:33:22 2015 UTC,"Goodbye faceoff wins, we hardly knew ya"
EdmontonOilers,3boy3f,Mysteri0n,5,Tue Jun 30 23:44:57 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but he would win the draw then hobble off the ice 80% of the time. Not that effective in terms of establishing some flow."
EdmontonOilers,3boy3f,LevSmash,7,Wed Jul 1 00:07:30 2015 UTC,Huh? The only draws Gordon would get off the ice after taking was during powerplays. And only about half of those.
EdmontonOilers,3boy3f,Icekommander,3,Wed Jul 1 03:04:32 2015 UTC,It's the 'make him a worse player than he is' schtick to make ourselves feel better about the trade. Remember how Petry was only a #5 Dman and we're lucky to get a 2nd for him.
EdmontonOilers,3boy3f,RedOilSaints,1 point,Wed Jul 1 09:24:42 2015 UTC,"Personally, I like the trade. I was never much of a Boyd Gordon fan. I don't know much about Korpikoski, but from my research, he hits and he's fast; he can dangle too, but doesn't have much of a shot. We all know Nuge and McDavid are going to be our 1-2, and despite how young that is, I don't think you need to fill out the centre corp with old veteran types. Usually the 3 and 4 spots are for up and comers from the farm anyway, and lander + Draisaitl is pretty tantalizing anyway.  I do think picking up a guy like Brodziak is pretty much a necessary move, but it's not like Gordon was irreplaceable. This trade made us more physical, and that's the meat of it."
EdmontonOilers,3boy3f,McEirhead,17,Wed Jul 1 03:33:32 2015 UTC,"I think another shoe is about to drop trade wise. This trade doesn't make sense other wise. Our C depth is green as hell. Unless we planning to tank for Chtulu (or whatever that D-man's name is), going green on D and C is a recipe for disaster.   Gordon played a big part with his defensive zone faceoffs and PK work. I think we're adding a vet C tomorrow."
EdmontonOilers,3boy3f,RedOilSaints,7,Tue Jun 30 23:42:58 2015 UTC,"That was my first thought on reading this - this has to be part one of something bigger. Chiarelli has already done that once this trade cycle, and I don't think he's silly enough to erode what little centre depth we have for a winger, that we have plenty of. Has to be more coming."
EdmontonOilers,3boy3f,conflare,3,Wed Jul 1 01:10:22 2015 UTC,"Please don't be Vermette, please don't be Vermette.."
EdmontonOilers,3boy3f,Chuffalo_Bill,6,Wed Jul 1 01:27:58 2015 UTC,Not Vermette
EdmontonOilers,3boy3f,eedok,1 point,Wed Jul 1 02:49:18 2015 UTC,lol
EdmontonOilers,3boy3f,IGetComputersPuting,2,Wed Jul 1 02:54:59 2015 UTC,"I think it's Letestu. RH C, 50+ on the dot, but the difference is he can put up more offense."
EdmontonOilers,3boy3f,RedOilSaints,3,Wed Jul 1 08:38:14 2015 UTC,I think I'd be okay with Vermette
EdmontonOilers,3boy3f,321DrTran,-3,Wed Jul 1 02:18:29 2015 UTC,"Its impossible to ""Tank"" anymore with the core the Oilers have. Thank fucking god."
EdmontonOilers,3boy3f,WarmBagOfLotion,3,Wed Jul 1 01:36:46 2015 UTC,"Have you seen our D and G? Reinhart is a rookie, klefbom is a sophomore and Schultz can't play D. Gryba and Ference is bottom pairing guys. You really can't imagine that leading us to a low finish? You're crazy."
EdmontonOilers,3boy3f,RedOilSaints,1 point,Wed Jul 1 07:31:01 2015 UTC,"Modest expectations would place this team around 10th to 13th place, thats unlikely to get 1st pick. Plus im sure Chiarelli isnt finished improving the club either. I think you're forgetting that Eakins is gone and its a fresh start with new management. Talbot is a good addition especially if he excels. Oilers are closer to playoffs then the lottery. But only time will tell, i don't know everything but i hope i am right. I want excitement from October to April, not June 10th to July 1st."
EdmontonOilers,3boy3f,WarmBagOfLotion,2,Wed Jul 1 07:53:29 2015 UTC,"If he doesn't add anything to the D, I think we're looking more at 13th to 15th place finish. I'm not forgetting Eakins, I'm just not going to pretend coaching can cover up for lack of experience (Reinhart, Klef or Schultz) or ability (Gryba or Ference). Our forwards should be strong, but it means nothing if we keep hoping our goaltending bails us out defensively. With this current D, we're closer to the lottery than to the playoffs."
EdmontonOilers,3boy3f,RedOilSaints,36,Wed Jul 1 08:36:55 2015 UTC,This one fucking hurts! Gordon was such a god damn trooper for us!  This one sucks. Fuck this trade.
EdmontonOilers,3boy3f,YAK_ATTACK_CALL_911,1 point,Tue Jun 30 23:34:59 2015 UTC,"Man, as a Rebels fan, this one really hurts."
EdmontonOilers,3boy3f,bezjones,22,Wed Jul 1 11:31:06 2015 UTC,NOOOO!! GORDON!!!!
EdmontonOilers,3boy3f,Vlykeron,3,Tue Jun 30 23:33:56 2015 UTC,"This fucking sucks.  He would have been valuable trade bait at the deadline, and now our centre depth sucks again.  Fuck.  And the return is a fourth line plug making $2.5X2 with zero trade value?  What.  The.  Fuck."
EdmontonOilers,3boy3f,Dr_Marxist,1 point,Wed Jul 1 01:04:04 2015 UTC,Yeah we haven't traded for one guy where the other fan base were sad to let go. Korpi was horrendous last year. We saved 500k and lost cap flexibility and added another bottom 6 winger that we don't need.
EdmontonOilers,3boy3f,tsn123456789,3,Wed Jul 1 01:11:03 2015 UTC,Cam Talbot?
EdmontonOilers,3boy3f,Giggleplex,2,Wed Jul 1 01:58:23 2015 UTC,"That's the exception, but I'm so far not impressed with the three other trades he made."
EdmontonOilers,3boy3f,tsn123456789,8,Wed Jul 1 02:03:29 2015 UTC,"Seems like good value but we better get a replacement. Dude was brilliant in his role and leaving it vacant makes no sense.  That said, if there was one area we were set I think it was forwards."
EdmontonOilers,3boy3f,oddspellingofPhreid,25,Tue Jun 30 23:44:27 2015 UTC,"Clears up $500K in salary, adds a younger asset with an extra year on his contract. Probably a 3/4LW. Gotta imagine Chia is looking at another centre tomorrow. No chance we go Nuge-CSP-Lander-Drai down the middle on opening day.  I am so confident something else is coming, that I'll bet my flair on it. If our centres opening night are RNH-CSP-Lander-Draisaitl, I'll wear Nikitin flair until Christmas."
EdmontonOilers,3boy3f,YouJagaloon,16,Tue Jun 30 23:41:27 2015 UTC,Nuge-CSP-Lander-Drai   Oh god... such skill/inexperience... it could go so horribly either way...
EdmontonOilers,3boy3f,mkwong,14,Tue Jun 30 23:46:34 2015 UTC,Sounds like an Oiler thing
EdmontonOilers,3boy3f,Vlykeron,8,Tue Jun 30 23:49:52 2015 UTC,He was already in talks to trade for Mike Richards on Friday so I wouldn't be surprised if we pick up a new centre
EdmontonOilers,3boy3f,WobblyHobbly,9,Tue Jun 30 23:48:35 2015 UTC,so do we split the bail with LA?
EdmontonOilers,3boy3f,Oil-and-Strippers,16,Tue Jun 30 23:57:02 2015 UTC,We are in talks with his new agent.. His probation officer
EdmontonOilers,3boy3f,WobblyHobbly,3,Tue Jun 30 23:59:19 2015 UTC,He lose flexibility just to save 500k on a guy who can't contribute who plays a position that we have too many of.
EdmontonOilers,3boy3f,tsn123456789,1 point,Wed Jul 1 00:53:38 2015 UTC,Tagged.
EdmontonOilers,3boy3f,Dr_Marxist,-2,Wed Jul 1 01:07:47 2015 UTC,"Not disagreeing with you, but Korpikoski was -27 this past season. Gordon was -5."
EdmontonOilers,3boy3f,notsoyoungpadawan,22,Tue Jun 30 23:56:20 2015 UTC,Using plus minus... lol
EdmontonOilers,3boy3f,LevSmash,-1,Wed Jul 1 00:06:38 2015 UTC,I don't see what's so wrong in comparing plus/minus of two players who were on teams so close to each other in the table.
EdmontonOilers,3boy3f,notsoyoungpadawan,5,Wed Jul 1 00:20:21 2015 UTC,"How they are deployed is totally different, ice time, line mates, etc. Gordon would win draws and book it to the bench right away most of the time."
EdmontonOilers,3boy3f,LevSmash,3,Wed Jul 1 00:23:18 2015 UTC,"Gordon has been on the ice for our most vulnerable periods in the game. Blocks a tonne of shots, works like a horse. In fact, I've never actually seen him book it to the bench after winning a defensive zone faceoff."
EdmontonOilers,3boy3f,notsoyoungpadawan,0,Wed Jul 1 01:09:42 2015 UTC,"Well, if he wins the draw in the D zone, that means the 4th line is simply getting it out, typically a short skate up ice for a dump-in, then they change. If he loses the draw? Yeah, he blocks shots, but he can't exactly chase guys down and retrieve the puck."
EdmontonOilers,3boy3f,LevSmash,1 point,Wed Jul 1 02:02:34 2015 UTC,What about the face-offs he wins in the d-zone and someone like Jultz/Nikitin give it away in the neutral zone? What about the face-offs he wins in the offensive zone and has to support the defence?
EdmontonOilers,3boy3f,notsoyoungpadawan,1 point,Wed Jul 1 04:07:24 2015 UTC,"Sounds like our defense is shyte, that's what. Here's hoping tomorrow brings good news."
EdmontonOilers,3boy3f,LevSmash,1 point,Wed Jul 1 04:15:30 2015 UTC,Eh. Its probably not going to go how we're all expecting it to go.
EdmontonOilers,3boy3f,notsoyoungpadawan,1 point,Wed Jul 1 04:51:38 2015 UTC,"Ya, that's the problem with Gordon: he's one-dimensional. He could win faceoffs and block shots but doesn't bring much in terms of offence.   It would be great if we could sign a two-way center tomorrow who may not be as good at faceoffs but makes up for it with offence."
EdmontonOilers,3boy3f,Giggleplex,7,Wed Jul 1 03:19:58 2015 UTC,"If I had to bet, I'd imagine Chia brings in Gregory Campbell (or Broadziak) tomorrow. Cheap veteran center, with (probably) a pretty low cap hit."
EdmontonOilers,3boy3f,blakehall,3,Tue Jun 30 23:51:51 2015 UTC,"Dear lord you do not want greg campbell (Bruins fan chiming in.) Campbell can kill penalties and that's it. He is absolutely awful at 5 v 5. It says something that dan paille was most of the reason he ever looked good.   That said, it would be a total Chiarelli move to bring in a veteran guy he's familiar with. He'll eat minutes on the 4th, probably be overpaid, and hopefully McClellan isn't as enamored with him as Claude."
EdmontonOilers,3boy3f,bwadams12,1 point,Wed Jul 1 03:34:53 2015 UTC,"I was counting on cheapness and familiarity, not pointing out someone I'd actually want ;)"
EdmontonOilers,3boy3f,blakehall,2,Wed Jul 1 11:30:19 2015 UTC,"The idea of Campbell on a team I like just sets me off.  I just can't handle any more Greg Campbell in my life.  FFS, he got more minutes per game last year than David Pastrnak."
EdmontonOilers,3boy3f,bwadams12,2,Wed Jul 1 13:41:47 2015 UTC,"Gregory Campbell is terrible, Chris Kelly would make a lot more sense."
EdmontonOilers,3boy3f,haterbehatin,4,Wed Jul 1 00:00:02 2015 UTC,"except Kelly isn't a free agent, and we've already established the B's aren't going to trade with Chia..."
EdmontonOilers,3boy3f,blakehall,-1,Wed Jul 1 02:06:05 2015 UTC,If they want a free agent replacement then a guy like Riley Nash would make a lot more sense.
EdmontonOilers,3boy3f,haterbehatin,6,Wed Jul 1 02:09:56 2015 UTC,"Fuck me I can't wrap my head around this, why mess up that amazing 4th line from last year?   Also once again there left with 4 NHL quality centres which basically guarantees Leon a spot on the team and doesn't give them an option to send him down if he's not looking ready.  Obviously the off-season is far from over but still it's a weird move for the moment."
EdmontonOilers,3boy3f,CeleryDistraction,4,Tue Jun 30 23:39:52 2015 UTC,WHAAAAAA? NOOOO!
EdmontonOilers,3boy3f,likeBruceSpringsteen,6,Tue Jun 30 23:47:28 2015 UTC,I'm really going to miss him.
EdmontonOilers,3boy3f,TheWildRover_,7,Tue Jun 30 23:53:41 2015 UTC,You win this round Ace.
EdmontonOilers,3boy3f,AlexStuart,3,Tue Jun 30 23:34:19 2015 UTC,Haha I beat you to it by about 10 seconds
EdmontonOilers,3boy3f,AlexStuart,2,Tue Jun 30 23:34:43 2015 UTC,....and so it begins..
EdmontonOilers,3boy3f,smexeh,3,Wed Jul 1 00:02:55 2015 UTC,The only thing I can think is that chia has his sights set on Richards? So he did a little salary dump which will allow us to have korpi and Richards for around what were paying for Gordon?
EdmontonOilers,3boy3f,WobblyHobbly,5,Tue Jun 30 23:46:18 2015 UTC,"So this basically comes off as :    Korpikoski plays 3rd line left wing and we go out and grab a 4th line centre tomorrow, meaning Drai starts the year in AHL Drai and Lander will be our bottom 2 centres, and Korpikoski starts at 3rd line regardless   damn still pissed that we had to give away Gordon"
EdmontonOilers,3boy3f,IAMA-CANADIAN-AMA,6,Tue Jun 30 23:37:00 2015 UTC,"It is worth noting that apparently Chia in talks for a trade for Mike Richards on Friday before the news came out, so maybe he was looking for another center and was already planning on losing Gordon?"
EdmontonOilers,3boy3f,Giggleplex,3,Tue Jun 30 23:44:57 2015 UTC,Isn't Purcell our third line left winger
EdmontonOilers,3boy3f,Vlykeron,6,Tue Jun 30 23:39:38 2015 UTC,Purcell normally plays on the right.
EdmontonOilers,3boy3f,Tylemaker,2,Wed Jul 1 00:45:05 2015 UTC,Guessing Purcell plays rw and Korpikoski plays lw
EdmontonOilers,3boy3f,Shottaz83,12,Tue Jun 30 23:43:32 2015 UTC,First trade I don't like  edit: since PC
EdmontonOilers,3boy3f,HarfNarfArf,15,Tue Jun 30 23:43:32 2015 UTC,"Why not? I mean I liked the Commish as much as everyone else here, but he really doesn't do all that much. He wins faceoffs, but he doesn't play very much, and he does absolutely nothing offensively. I should also add we're paying him $3 Million a year for that. Korpi is younger and has much higher upside, and he's cheaper. He'll be good depth for our bottom 6 and can put up decent numbers. Chia has also said he wants to add another veteran player, so I imagine we'll be signing someone very soon."
EdmontonOilers,3boy3f,Trollingitis,7,Wed Jul 1 00:00:05 2015 UTC,"I agree with this, and I love Boydo. He has value to the team, but it is replaceable value. I see Chia signing Letestu tomorrow for the 4C spot."
EdmontonOilers,3boy3f,HarfNarfArf,2,Wed Jul 1 00:06:46 2015 UTC,He's a local boy and would love to play in edm. Has it happened yet?
EdmontonOilers,3boy3f,haterbehatin,1 point,Wed Jul 1 17:14:30 2015 UTC,"Just happened! 1.8 million for 3 years. Boyd was signed for 3 million for 3 years, this coming year being the final year. Similar player for 1.2 cheaper, with the term reset essentially."
EdmontonOilers,3boy3f,Arunatic5,-12,Wed Jul 1 17:17:27 2015 UTC,You liked his other shit trades?  Edit-apparently people thinking overpaying for Reinhart and selling low on Marincin to get Eric Gryba of all people were actually excellent trades.  Good to know.
EdmontonOilers,3boy3f,haterbehatin,8,Tue Jun 30 23:51:03 2015 UTC,Yeah. His trades so far have been lack lustre.
EdmontonOilers,3boy3f,B0mb-Hands,3,Wed Jul 1 00:11:19 2015 UTC,"I really liked the Talbot deal other than that it seems like a lot of meh.   Reinhart needs to excel as in be at least a number 3 defenseman or Barzal and Carlo/Blackwood or whoever need to do poorly or it's not a great deal for Edmonton.  The Marincin for Gryba swap was a whole lot of meh it's adding a bottom pairing guy while gaining a bottom pairing guy. So it's adding another guy on a team that already has too many particularly now that they added Reinhart instead of a more established guy and he'll likely need to be on that bottom pairing if he cracks the roster.   Then he pulls this Gordon for Korpikoski deal and Korpi seems to be nothing special. Corsi, Shot generation, Hero.  So instead of a 4th liner who wins draws, kills penalties etc etc the team gets a 4th liner who does jack shit and for an extra year and now they need to go out and find someone to replace Gordon."
EdmontonOilers,3boy3f,haterbehatin,-1,Wed Jul 1 02:07:45 2015 UTC,Who says we'd have taken Barzal?
EdmontonOilers,3boy3f,B0mb-Hands,0,Wed Jul 1 03:39:37 2015 UTC,Top guy available.
EdmontonOilers,3boy3f,Dr_Marxist,-2,Wed Jul 1 03:41:56 2015 UTC,So? Lots of teams don't take the top ranked guy
EdmontonOilers,3boy3f,envague,3,Wed Jul 1 03:58:06 2015 UTC,"I don't know where the downvotes are coming from.  Marincin had pretty decent upside, and Gryba is not as good today as Marty, and his upside is decline.  And Reinhart...I dunno.  My gut says it was not good value, and it reeked of OBC.  We wait."
EdmontonOilers,3boy3f,MaxxLolz,6,Wed Jul 1 01:06:48 2015 UTC,"It sucks that people are downvoting opinions. We can't whine about it happening in r/hockey while practicing it here.   Anyways, I just think we're well past trading for value. The team should be improving now and not concentrating on winning trades on an individual basis and perpetually building for the future. Chiarelli came into the job saying he wants players who play hard and heavy which Marincin really isn't and Reinhart is."
EdmontonOilers,3boy3f,haterbehatin,4,Wed Jul 1 01:15:02 2015 UTC,Gryba is not as good some ways and better other ways.
EdmontonOilers,3boy3f,goilers97,1 point,Wed Jul 1 01:46:54 2015 UTC,"My gut says it was not good value, and it reeked of OBC. We wait.   That's the big one looking at what they gave up Barzal and one of Carlo/Blackwood/Dermott/Sprong it seems to me that those guys have to either not pan out or Reinhart has to become at minimum a #3 defenseman.   He might make it to that level and I like every Oilers fan hopes he does but that's a pretty lofty floor for that deal to be worthwhile.   Particularly when the main draw seems to be how he performed for the top scout in Jr, it doesn't get more OBC than that."
EdmontonOilers,3boy3f,tsn123456789,1 point,Wed Jul 1 01:45:23 2015 UTC,How can you say a guy who was getting scratched in the ahl playoffs last year is better than a guy that was playing in the nhl playoffs. Marty had zero trade value because of his drop off in play. He has all the tools to be a pretty do of dman but he needs a lot of work to get there.
EdmontonOilers,3boy3f,haterbehatin,0,Wed Jul 1 04:58:23 2015 UTC,If this was MacT everyone would've ripped the management a new one (I mean Reinhart back to EDM??). We haven't traded for one guy where the other fan base was unhappy to let go. It seems that most Oiler fans are giving Chiarelli a lot more leeway because he's not OBC and trying to justify his every move as great even when they've all been questionable.
EdmontonOilers,3boy3f,tsn123456789,0,Wed Jul 1 01:18:00 2015 UTC,"I think he gets a lot of rope because the Bruins won the Cup but based on his actual transaction history in Boston I think there's a lot to be skeptical of.   I guess people don't like hearing that, I really hope he does a good job, his history says that's not a guarantee."
EdmontonOilers,3boy3f,haterbehatin,1 point,Wed Jul 1 01:45:06 2015 UTC,"Yup he's trying to turn this into a ""heavy"" team while we were built off of speed. He got 2 guys on D who can't skate on a team built to beat the other team with skating. We're just going to end up with a mish-mash of a forward group who can skate and a D core who acts as an anchor. All four teams who made the CF this year are built on skating especially from the backend so maybe Chia should focus on guys who can do that instead of guys who's sole skill is big and can throw hits."
EdmontonOilers,3boy3f,tsn123456789,0,Wed Jul 1 02:02:24 2015 UTC,"Yeah I thought he was on the right track when he talked about heavy meaning guys who can win pucks, then he went heavy as in guys who are boat anchors that hit.   Hamilton would've been a great addition for that, Reinhart seems questionable in terms of skating but maybe he'll get there.  I just don't get adding Gryba when Ference is still on the team, if Reinhart is going to need bottom pairing minutes there's no room for Gryba and Ference unless one of the two is going to be a regular healthy scratch.   Then you're looking at Nikitin? I guess being on a pairing with either Schultz or Fayne.   I think Schultz needs to be put in the best position to succeed so that's either with Klefbom who he's played better with or some sort of addition.   Unless Chiarelli has some ace up his sleeve to get rid of Ference and Nikitin, I just don't see any scenario where moving Marincin out in order to bring in Gryba was a good idea."
EdmontonOilers,3boy3f,haterbehatin,1 point,Wed Jul 1 02:31:12 2015 UTC,"That was my thought as well but then he went full Bruins on us...guess you can't take the Bruin out of Chia.   My best guess is that Reinhart starts in the AHL. There's absolutely no way he starts in the NHL, he'll get killed; he needs to be able to keep up in the AHL before thinking about the NHL. No idea about Nikitin but I hope that even if he stays on the roster that he doesn't touch the ice. I think our top six as is will be Klefbom Fayne Schultz Ference Gryba and we will probably add one or two guys via FA on shorter term deals who can hopefully move the puck and push Gryba to the 7D and Schultz to the bottom pairing."
EdmontonOilers,3boy3f,HarfNarfArf,1 point,Wed Jul 1 02:49:54 2015 UTC,"Yeah I would hope Reinhart and Nurse both have to earn their spots rather than being handed a role, conversely they seem to be blocked by Ference and Nikitin for the spot they should be able to fight for.   I'd love Gryba to be the 7th guy but I'd be surprised if he traded for him with that role in mind, it's the role he should have but I just don't know what Chia has in mind.  Case in point trading for Korpikoski who according to war on ice is basically awful at everything."
EdmontonOilers,3boy3f,Ferocian,3,Wed Jul 1 05:19:48 2015 UTC,"Boydo :( So what, maybe Draisaitl 3C? Maybe Chia has an FA in store for tomorrow?"
EdmontonOilers,3boy3f,MaxxLolz,3,Tue Jun 30 23:35:14 2015 UTC,Shit I loved Boyd Gordon. Him and Hendricks were our best competitors every night.
EdmontonOilers,3boy3f,eatingasspatties,3,Wed Jul 1 01:37:46 2015 UTC,"Dont like this one at all.  Too early to move him out.    Yea yea his offensive numbers weren't great but he did ALL of the heavy defensive lifting, all the keys faceoffs and never took a night off which I'm not really sure I can say about any other forward not named Hendricks or Klinkhammer."
EdmontonOilers,3boy3f,IAMA-CANADIAN-AMA,4,Wed Jul 1 01:49:29 2015 UTC,I mean I liked Gordon a lot but I have no issues with the trade at all.
EdmontonOilers,3boy3f,Reintegration,2,Wed Jul 1 00:04:38 2015 UTC,What a weird move.... Why we get rid of our best faceoff and defensive forward?  Also mods am I banned from submitting things to this sub?
EdmontonOilers,3boy3f,Dr_Marxist,6,Tue Jun 30 23:34:47 2015 UTC,His body doesn't have a whole lot left and they probably think Lander can take his place.  I'm still sad though.

Something like Slater, Campbell, Letestu, Beagle should come in cheaper than 3mil."
EdmontonOilers,3boy3f,RedOilSaints,1 point,Wed Jul 1 02:24:12 2015 UTC,"I don't know why Hendricks can't slide into the 4C role Korpi becomes 4LW. We lose a few more (a lot more) faceoffs, but we might have 4 lines that can score with a line up with Drai-Lander-Purcell as our 3rd, and Korpi-Hendy-Klink/Gaz/Pitlick as our 4 + 13th/14th forwards"
EdmontonOilers,3boy3f,TDE_NoJoke,1 point,Wed Jul 1 02:52:37 2015 UTC,"I expected either more cap relief or better return when the commish was eventually moved but I think the negativity toward this deal springs from Stockholm syndrome. Last year's team was a train wreck, but damnit it was our train wreck how dare they break it up?   The overpaid fourth line Center wasn't part of the solution; but I'm having difficulty seeing how the 2.5 million dollar left winger who scored one even strength goal last year is an upgrade at any spot."

EdmontonOilers,3boy3f,VanPerstrings,1 point,Tue Jun 30 23:59:44 2015 UTC,"I like this one. He's younger, fills the hole we had in 3LW (which then opens another, but I digress) and he shaves a bit off the contract.    Stop getting mad about the state of the roster, guys, there's still fucking months to go.  Strictly on a trade value basis this wasn't a terrible move."
EdmontonOilers,3boy3f,sameermcfly,0,Wed Jul 1 00:03:19 2015 UTC,WHAT?! WHY?!! NOOOOOO  Hmmmm Oil needs veterans that play heavy game... Trades Gordon. WTH!!!! I don't get this at all. What's next? A trade for a young AHL forward for Hendricks???? What about veteran defence??? Augh!  Having trust issues again...  Edit: OK never mind about the defence. Chia got us some. Thank goodness.

But anything over 4M for Oduya and $4.5 for Sekera is too much and we might as well wait for next off season to go big game hunting when the UFA class is much, much deeper."

EdmontonOilers,3bnyht,MrSlipp,6,Wed Jul 1 01:33:08 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't trust much of what Stauffer says. Most of his views are just based on his hunch and nothing factual. For example, on Friday he said he couldn't see us picking up Talbot because we'd given up all our top picks.   There are rumours circulating that Chia might be looking to trade. Whether that's what actually happens, we'll see. I personally expect him to, though. Can't see us going into next season with the same top pairing D."
EdmontonOilers,3bnyht,notsoyoungpadawan,4,Tue Jun 30 19:57:30 2015 UTC,"The top pairing defenseman was out there, they missed out, it sucks but that's how it does.   What top pairing defense are available in trade?   Hamilton was the only guy I can think of or Buff or Seabrook but those are both short term players that the Oilers should stay away from same with Phaneuf.   I just don't see a ton of options of guys who would make sense for this year and subsequent years."
EdmontonOilers,3bnyht,haterbehatin,2,Tue Jun 30 20:05:56 2015 UTC,"Adam Larsson or Seth Jones, there would be conversations if we throw in Eberle's name. Or get Del Zotto (not top pairing but good top 4). There are options out there if you look hard enough."
EdmontonOilers,3bnyht,tsn123456789,4,Tue Jun 30 20:18:11 2015 UTC,"I don't think Larsson is available. He's finally turning the corner for them, it'd be surprising if Shero of all people was willing to move him.   Jones is interesting but they need a centre more than a winger and Poile loves defensemen so there might be some potential there and credit to Chiarelli if he can get Jones for something based around Draisaitl but he too isin't necessarily available and I'm not on board with giving up Nuge for Jones. The team still needs Nuge too much to move him.   Del Zotto is just kind of pointless in my mind based on what he'd cost to acquire and where he'd slot onto the roster. If he wasn't qualified he'd make sense but given the teams need I don't think Del Zotto would be worth pursing."
EdmontonOilers,3bnyht,haterbehatin,2,Tue Jun 30 20:25:10 2015 UTC,"I was just listing some examples that are possibilities off the top of my head, there's probably a lot more. There's always undervalued guys or guys who were given a fair shot/need a change of scenery (ie Ribeiro last year) that are not obvious.  If Devils strike out on Kessel then there's a realistic chance that they'd be willing to listen for Larsson (who by the way, has no contract and we can straight up offer sheet).  Del Zotto could be the man out with Phillys D being so crowded. He's not elite but he can slot pretty nicely beside a guy like Fayne. He played well in Philly last year."
EdmontonOilers,3bnyht,tsn123456789,1 point,Tue Jun 30 20:31:52 2015 UTC,"Jones is interesting but they need a centre more than a winger and Poile loves defensemen so there might be some potential there and credit to Chiarelli if he can get Jones for something based around Draisaitl but he too isin't necessarily available and I'm not on board with giving up Nuge for Jones. The team still needs Nuge too much to move him.   I don't think its that cut and dry. Forsberg is a centre (even though he played on the wings this season) and I'm sure they'd be looking towards him to lead the line for the future. Plus if players like Hall or Eberle are available, I'm sure Nashville will listen to what Chia has to say. Nashville desperate need offence, and either of those two could help them out.  That being said, Poile is extremely shrewd with his trades, so I'd be wary."
EdmontonOilers,3bnyht,notsoyoungpadawan,1 point,Tue Jun 30 20:33:40 2015 UTC,I think at this point Forsberg is probably a centre like Eberle is a centre. I haven't heard any rumblings about him being moved to the middle anyways.   The other issue is that trading Hall and Eberle should be considered but there really aren't any internal candidates to fill their roles unless Leon is moved to left wing but he seems more like a Pouliot replacement to me.
EdmontonOilers,3bnyht,haterbehatin,1 point,Tue Jun 30 21:35:02 2015 UTC,"Not even slightly. I watched pretty much every Nashville game last season and he is nothing like Eberle. His work rate is off the charts and he isn't afraid to throw hits and battle in the corners. He is literally nothing like Eberle.  Finding replacements for wings isn't much of an issue. There are a bunch of quality wingers available almost every year. If we can sign a #1 D-man like Weber in exchange for Hall, I'd do it."
EdmontonOilers,3bnyht,notsoyoungpadawan,1 point,Tue Jun 30 22:43:44 2015 UTC,"Not even slightly. I watched pretty much every Nashville game last season and he is nothing like Eberle. His work rate is off the charts and he isn't afraid to throw hits and battle in the corners. He is literally nothing like Eberle.   I never said he was a player like Eberle. I said he was a centre in the same way Eberle is one meaning he started off as a centre, moved to wing, in the NHL plays the wing and is likely to never play centre in the NHL.    I think you're greatly underestimating how hard it is to find a player like Taylor Hall or Jordan Eberle."
EdmontonOilers,3bnyht,haterbehatin,1 point,Tue Jun 30 22:47:52 2015 UTC,That would be like saying Mackinnon is a centre in the same way Eberle is a centre because they both started off as centres but got moved to the wing. Rookie Centres often get played on the wing. Doesn't mean they're going to end up as wingers.
EdmontonOilers,3bnyht,notsoyoungpadawan,1 point,Tue Jun 30 22:57:09 2015 UTC,"What top pairing defense are available in trade?   I'm not talking about defencemen that are available. I'm talking about an outright trade, and its very possible. Chia has thrown Hall's name around quite a bit since he's taken over (supposedly) so if he is in the mix, then don't rule anything out. Of course, all this is just speculation at this point, but like I said, I think Chia is looking to sign 2 more D-men."

RHD who is thick (225 lbs) and is physical. Will hit everything. Decent defensively and has a cannon of a shot. Plays a little like byfuglien.   Both I think get signed if they show decent ability.

Good in the defensive end, stocky, and has a cannon of a shot. I think he has top-4 upside."

EdmontonOilers,3bn0om,Ferocian,1 point,Tue Jun 30 19:13:16 2015 UTC,"Do we still have Ty Rimmer under contract? If so, any idea why he's not there? Too old, maybe?"
EdmontonOilers,3bn0om,9Bains,2,Tue Jun 30 16:12:22 2015 UTC,He's under contract with Bakersfield so he'll either play for them or Norfolk.
EdmontonOilers,3bn0om,haterbehatin,2,Tue Jun 30 16:25:55 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the info, wasn't sure what his contract situation was."
EdmontonOilers,3bn0om,9Bains,2,Tue Jun 30 18:22:26 2015 UTC,"List of their current signees, I don't think they've added anyone since then.  I'm not sure how many of the Barons they'll be bringing back or when those signings usually happen."
EdmontonOilers,3bn0om,haterbehatin,1 point,Tue Jun 30 19:59:13 2015 UTC,Who's this Sanford kid?
EdmontonOilers,3bn0om,critercat,1 point,Tue Jun 30 16:32:28 2015 UTC,"50 goals and 95 points. Looks like he's an over-ager and was likely passed over due to his size (5'9"" 165 pounds).  He look like Andrew Miller's twin bother."
EdmontonOilers,3bn0om,Giggleplex,1 point,Tue Jun 30 18:50:15 2015 UTC,Hopefully I can make it out for one of the days. I've never seen any of them play live.
EdmontonOilers,3bn0om,Shottaz83,1 point,Tue Jun 30 16:38:52 2015 UTC,Anyone going? I'm going to be there on Sunday.
EdmontonOilers,3bn0qg,envague,17,Tue Jun 30 15:10:56 2015 UTC,"One Sekera please. That's it.   Everyone is gonna get overpaid as per usual, So I'd rather we just pick up one contract this year instead of saddling ourselves for a couple years of overpaid players. Next year we have Nikitin and Purcell off the books. That's when we should spend a bit more.  This is where I hope Chia learned from past mistakes when it came to putting himself in Cap Hell."
EdmontonOilers,3bn0qg,YAK_ATTACK_CALL_911,10,Tue Jun 30 15:30:17 2015 UTC,I'm so impressed with his draft day I'm not even worried any more.  I know people hate the Marincin trade but I honestly think we as Oil fans might overvalue him because our defence has been such shit.
EdmontonOilers,3bn0qg,StealAllTheInternets,1 point,Tue Jun 30 16:11:48 2015 UTC,Anything changed?
EdmontonOilers,3bn0qg,FreyWill,5,Wed Jul 1 04:20:59 2015 UTC,"Unless he really wants a change of scenery, I don't see him moving from the Kings especially now that the Kings have cap space due to the nullified Richards contract.  :("
EdmontonOilers,3bn0qg,mooky1977,3,Tue Jun 30 16:48:30 2015 UTC,Worth a shot. I think he fits us better than any of the other guys. Franson and Green would be good additions but they'll cost too much.  EDIT: According to an /r/hockey thread he does intend to go to Free Agency.
EdmontonOilers,3bn0qg,YAK_ATTACK_CALL_911,2,Tue Jun 30 16:55:54 2015 UTC,So. Uh. God damn!
EdmontonOilers,3bn0qg,shweet44722,2,Wed Jul 1 18:50:02 2015 UTC,"I stand corrected....   a bit expensive for a guy that is a # 2 or #3 but the length is worse than the money.  Not terrible, but I would have been more comfortable with a 4 or 5 year contract.   I guess it won't seem so bad once Nikitin (and to a lesser degree Ferrence) are gone though."
EdmontonOilers,3bn0qg,mooky1977,2,Wed Jul 1 18:52:40 2015 UTC,"Yeah, thing is he was going to get that somewhere else too, even potentially more. FA's this year are gonna get paaaaid despite it being a rather weak FA class. I'm inclined to agree, but we are getting him in his prime years. Would've preferred maybe a more front loaded contract so we could buy him out or trade him more easily towards the end of his contract but eh, either way.  Agreed. I feel like they'll being pushed out more and more, which is fine by me."
EdmontonOilers,3bn0qg,shweet44722,4,Wed Jul 1 19:00:38 2015 UTC,Question: why Sekera and not Beauchemin?
EdmontonOilers,3bn0qg,notsoyoungpadawan,5,Tue Jun 30 16:52:32 2015 UTC,Age difference. Sekera is only 29 while Beauchemin is 35. We could possibly be adding a long term piece in Sekera.
EdmontonOilers,3bn0qg,YAK_ATTACK_CALL_911,4,Tue Jun 30 16:54:35 2015 UTC,"I don't think age should be our primary concern right now. Sekera isn't a defensive defenceman, which is what we really need for our top line right now in my opinion. Also, I wouldn't want to sign Sekera for on a long term contract. He's only had one season where he's posted above 30 points.. The rest have been around 20. So paying top dollar for an offensive defenceman who isn't really proven would be a bad move. I would rather offer Beauchemin a 1 or 2 year deal and sign some big time defencemen in next season's market, because there are going to be a tonne of them."
EdmontonOilers,3bn0qg,notsoyoungpadawan,4,Tue Jun 30 17:26:22 2015 UTC,"Beauchemin has peaked. Sekera is hopefully just entering his prime. We just picked up Gryba plus we have Fayne as a defensive guy. We need a puck mover to get it out of our zone. Sekera is much better at that than Beauchemin. The aging defensive guys haven't worked out for us. (Ference Nikitin Foster Barker Sutton...)  And as far as next year goes, like I said in another comment, we have Purcell and Nikitin off the books which will give us enough room to deal with a Dman in next years FA class.   Don't get me wrong, if we do sign Beauchemin I won't be upset or anything, but I think a guy like Sekera just fits our mold better."
EdmontonOilers,3bn0qg,YAK_ATTACK_CALL_911,1 point,Tue Jun 30 17:36:33 2015 UTC,"That's not the point. Sekera's potential at the most is a top 4 D-man, not top 2, so giving him a large contract only makes things worse for us since we're loaded with top 4 and top 6 D-men. What we need is someone who is able to bring stability to the defence. We're going to have to pick up 2 D-men before the start of the season, because we literally don't have a #1 RHD at the moment. I won't be surprised if Chia tries to go big with a trade."
EdmontonOilers,3bn0qg,notsoyoungpadawan,2,Tue Jun 30 17:41:51 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry but, what?  Since when are we loaded with top 4 dmen? Last I checked we had a buttload of bottom pairing guys. A 35+ defensive Dman who's on the decline isn't going to stabilize anything.  And not once did I say we needed to sell the farm for Sekera. I said he could be a fit for us long term, not that he will be our #1 Dman for years to come. I also made no mention of where he would slot into our lineup although he would be an improvement on most of them.  As far as the RHD goes, the Stanley Cup winning blueline has barely any RH guys on it. There doesn't need to be a perfect balance."
EdmontonOilers,3bn0qg,YAK_ATTACK_CALL_911,3,Tue Jun 30 17:57:07 2015 UTC,"Plus Sekera is still only 29. I think Ehrhoff or Franson would be decent too, but we really can't take on any other contracts without buying out or trading defensemen."
EdmontonOilers,3bn0qg,ClintonsDix,13,Tue Jun 30 16:27:31 2015 UTC,"I think Sergio Ramos would provide some much needed intensity he just needs to work on his skating, stick handling, passing, shooting and basically every other hockey skill. Could prove to be a good signing though."
EdmontonOilers,3bn0qg,stelts94,8,Tue Jun 30 17:23:21 2015 UTC,"Idk, thats a ton of D we dont need.  1) NIKITIN - GRYBA 2) SCHULTZ - FERENCE 3) REINHART - FAYNE   What else do we need? /s"
EdmontonOilers,3bn0qg,plahcinski,8,Tue Jun 30 16:13:42 2015 UTC,There's no way that we don't have Brad Hunt playing on the top pairing. That's what we signed him for.

EdmontonOilers,3bn0qg,Lemon_Cola,6,Wed Jul 1 04:56:13 2015 UTC,Did Dusty Neilson post this? Sergio Ramos lol...
EdmontonOilers,3bn0qg,El_reverso,14,Tue Jun 30 15:44:08 2015 UTC,Are you suggesting that he wouldn't immediately slot into our top pair?
EdmontonOilers,3bn0qg,El_reverso,2,Tue Jun 30 15:52:03 2015 UTC,He probably would lol.
EdmontonOilers,3bn0qg,shweet44722,1 point,Wed Jul 1 01:16:38 2015 UTC,Yet again Man U would be used for a player to increase their eventual stock. tsk tsk.
EdmontonOilers,3bn0qg,partysanTM,5,Wed Jul 1 18:52:06 2015 UTC,Still better than Nikitin.
EdmontonOilers,3bn0qg,AlleyBj,7,Tue Jun 30 16:09:30 2015 UTC,"Rumour has it that Chiarelli wants to add a veteran winger this off season too, I wonder who he is after"
EdmontonOilers,3bn0qg,VanPerstrings,0,Tue Jun 30 16:20:47 2015 UTC,"I want Yak/Drai to have success here, but if one of them nets a young top pair RHD, it opens up the room to sign a guy like Justin Williams to be McDavid's winger. Might not be the popular move, but I think it'd be the right one."
EdmontonOilers,3bn0qg,DriArcher,1 point,Tue Jun 30 18:36:54 2015 UTC,You think Yak could net a young top pairing defensman?
EdmontonOilers,3bn0qg,VanPerstrings,1 point,Wed Jul 1 02:51:32 2015 UTC,"Yak+ perhaps. Mark Dano was a key piece in the Saad deal, so who knows."
EdmontonOilers,3bn0qg,smexeh,4,Wed Jul 1 03:37:35 2015 UTC,one Sergio Ramos please
EdmontonOilers,3bn0qg,YouJagaloon,8,Tue Jun 30 17:42:44 2015 UTC,"If Calgary doesn't sign Dougie by tomorrow, I still think we should offer sheet him at 5x$7.3M. They'll almost certainly match, but if that's more than they wanted to pay him it could hinder their chances of signing Franson or a part of their core next year. Win/win."
EdmontonOilers,3bn0qg,champion_dave,10,Tue Jun 30 15:51:17 2015 UTC,Guaranteed that Brian Burke challenges Chiarelli to a barn fight in that scenario.
EdmontonOilers,3bn0qg,Lemon_Cola,1 point,Tue Jun 30 16:15:06 2015 UTC,Can we still have this arranged?
EdmontonOilers,3bn0qg,stelts94,3,Wed Jul 1 04:55:35 2015 UTC,"I would love that, please make it happen Pete  Dammit"
EdmontonOilers,3bn0qg,notsoyoungpadawan,3,Tue Jun 30 17:26:00 2015 UTC,I have a feeling Dougie will wait it out and see what offers are on the table before committing.  EDIT: Never mind.
EdmontonOilers,3bn0qg,YouJagaloon,6,Tue Jun 30 17:56:50 2015 UTC,That contract is a real kick in the crotch. The idea that we could have him for only 1.3 Nikitins never even crossed my mind.   Can't believe he didn't wait for a $7.3M offer sheet.
EdmontonOilers,3bn0qg,notsoyoungpadawan,3,Tue Jun 30 18:51:39 2015 UTC,"Wow, it just makes Nikitin's contract look that much worse when you put it like that."
EdmontonOilers,3bn0qg,VanPerstrings,4,Tue Jun 30 19:47:37 2015 UTC,Stauffer is saying the Oilers aren't expected to make moves in free agency for a dman.    Are you kidding me? The defense is still the worst in the league by far.

EdmontonOilers,3bn0qg,notsoyoungpadawan,3,Wed Jul 1 01:52:31 2015 UTC,Indeed
EdmontonOilers,3bn0qg,AlleyBj,2,Wed Jul 1 01:55:01 2015 UTC,"I find it infuriating that Eberle and Yak's names come up in exchange for Sutter. Sutter is a 3C at best, while both Eberle and Yak are top line material. I hope Chia doesn't pull something stupid like that, because Pens are desperate for a winger. I'm basically in the Olli Maatta or gtfo camp."
EdmontonOilers,3bn0qg,KingDave46,3,Wed Jul 1 06:18:13 2015 UTC,"I agree. Id be willing to give up Yak if Maata was involved cause him, Nurse, Klef and a FA would be a good top 4"
EdmontonOilers,3bn0qg,DriArcher,1 point,Wed Jul 1 06:36:37 2015 UTC,"All I can say about that is that at least nobody mentioned CSP.  Hall, Yak and Ebs all talked about although there were people saying how terrible the ideas are at least.  Plus who is that source?"
EdmontonOilers,3bn0qg,AlleyBj,1 point,Wed Jul 1 01:54:09 2015 UTC,What is frustrating exactly?
EdmontonOilers,3bn0qg,DriArcher,2,Wed Jul 1 02:52:01 2015 UTC,"Haha I'm pretty sure we talked in the other thread on /r/hockey, but there were a few offers that were insane."
EdmontonOilers,3bn0qg,AlleyBj,1 point,Wed Jul 1 03:06:04 2015 UTC,"Yeah there were some bads ones. What do you think about Sutter Dumoulin and a pick for Yak? If the rumor that you guys are looking into Sutter is true, who do you think it's for?  Because he has one year left on his contract.  I don't think Edmonton takes that deal, I wish though."
EdmontonOilers,3bn0qg,DriArcher,1 point,Wed Jul 1 03:09:29 2015 UTC,Most of us here have really high expectations for Yak and think he is pretty much untouchable unless we're getting a top pairing defenseman.
EdmontonOilers,3bn0qg,AlleyBj,0,Wed Jul 1 03:24:56 2015 UTC,I don't think he's worth that at this point in his career at all.
EdmontonOilers,3bn0qg,YouJagaloon,1 point,Wed Jul 1 03:26:57 2015 UTC,I'm hoping that he excels under TMac.

EdmontonOilers,3bn0qg,0ILERS,3,Tue Jun 30 15:54:08 2015 UTC,"With Gordon leaving, what do you guys think about Shawn Matthias as a depth center signing for cheap?  Or is Edmonton just going to rely on their ultra skilled centres in the bottom two lines too?"
EdmontonOilers,3bn0qg,speedonthis,2,Tue Jun 30 23:41:47 2015 UTC,My dad just texted me saying Martin St Louis was spotted at WEM today. Wtf? That sounds like maybe a top 6 winger is on the way out
EdmontonOilers,3bn0qg,YouJagaloon,5,Wed Jul 1 00:32:09 2015 UTC,His kid is playing in the Brick tournament.
EdmontonOilers,3bn0qg,speedonthis,2,Wed Jul 1 01:09:18 2015 UTC,Hooo boy...
EdmontonOilers,3bn0qg,arcticcatherder,2,Wed Jul 1 03:12:35 2015 UTC,Trading Yak before he has a chance to play with a real centre and under a good coach would be asinine. We have him for 2 years at dirt cheap and don't need to make any big contract decisions for 3. Pass.
EdmontonOilers,3bn0qg,speedonthis,1 point,Wed Jul 1 03:23:20 2015 UTC,"Agreed. Eakins never used him properly and in some ways shunned him, he began to shine under Nelly so I'd love to see how things pan out with MacLellan at the reigns."
EdmontonOilers,3bn0qg,arcticcatherder,1 point,Wed Jul 1 03:53:01 2015 UTC,FUCK THAT. If Chia trades Yak right now without seeing how he does with proper centremen and with CSP I'll be FURIOUS. Now is not the time to trade a guy like Yak. OMG. Who is this guy and his source? This better not be true.
EdmontonOilers,3bn0qg,speedonthis,1 point,Wed Jul 1 06:28:48 2015 UTC,The source is some Marlies beat writer so I'm not really buying this one bit.
EdmontonOilers,3bn0qg,shweet44722,1 point,Wed Jul 1 15:13:19 2015 UTC,I hope you're right. I'm nervous now. I love Yak. I really don't want him traded. I want to see his potential before any rash decisions are made.
EdmontonOilers,3bn0qg,speedonthis,2,Wed Jul 1 16:09:35 2015 UTC,I don't think this is going to happen so you can relax.
EdmontonOilers,3bn0qg,shweet44722,2,Wed Jul 1 17:21:27 2015 UTC,"Dude. You know me, don't scare me like that with Yak rumours!"
EdmontonOilers,3bn0qg,Meowingtons-PhD,2,Wed Jul 1 18:55:29 2015 UTC,Thankfully that's all they are: rumors. TJ Oshie is not the player we want or need so hopefully this just fades into nothing.
EdmontonOilers,3bn0qg,haterbehatin,1 point,Wed Jul 1 19:31:49 2015 UTC,I'm glad. And agreed. He's got great hands and is good at shootouts but that's about it.

EdmontonOilers,3blle9,tsn123456789,6,Tue Jun 30 05:28:33 2015 UTC,He'll probably go for around 5.5+

EdmontonOilers,3blle9,slefob,6,Wed Jul 1 19:37:06 2015 UTC,"He's my favourite UFA defenceman this year, but there's no way he goes cheap. If we're gonna pick up a defenceman this year, it's gonna be an over-payment unfortunately."
EdmontonOilers,3blle9,shweet44722,5,Tue Jun 30 05:33:14 2015 UTC,"The cheapest defense man this free agency is likely gonna be Ehrhoff, due to the string of underwhelming seasons in Buffalo, and the injury plagued season he had with Pittsburgh he'd likely be the cheapest and we might still be looking  at $4M/yr. If he can get his stride back, and play like he did in Vancouver he would be a great teacher for Schultz, and a countryman for Draisaitl too"
EdmontonOilers,3blle9,9Bains,2,Tue Jun 30 05:50:37 2015 UTC,Ehrhoff's also going to be more willing to sign a lower-value contract because he's got buyout money coming for like the next 8 years.
EdmontonOilers,3blle9,Roughly6Owls,2,Tue Jun 30 17:15:03 2015 UTC,"Very true. It's a lot coming his way too, if I remember his situation he's getting somewhere in the vicinity of $4M for the next 8 yrs, but even at $4M/yr from us hell be the cheapest top pairing d available. Honestly I expect something around $1.5-2M on a longer term, but I'm being conservative."
EdmontonOilers,3blle9,9Bains,3,Tue Jun 30 18:29:15 2015 UTC,"He's one of maybe three most talked about UFA D, he'll probably get 6 mil, and he'd be in our top pair with who ever else we can get.  If we can get 2 of Sekera/Martin/Green/Franson at under $12mil, reasonable term for their age I'd be happy."
EdmontonOilers,3blle9,ABirdOfParadise,2,Tue Jun 30 05:58:41 2015 UTC,"If we can get 2 of Beauchemin/Ehroff/Sekera/Green ill be ecstatic  Fayne/Sekera  Ehroff/Klefbom  Gryba/Schultz  Reinhart/Ference  Still not great....but serviceable!  Edit: Forgot Fayne and Gryba! I like Fayne, very solid defensively"

EdmontonOilers,3blle9,LuisBitMe,1 point,Wed Jul 1 18:13:33 2015 UTC,"No shit?  :P  Still a bit long of a contract at 5.5 AAV.  Would have been more comfortable with 4 or 5 years max, but tolerable once Nikitin is gone I guess."
EdmontonOilers,3blle9,mooky1977,2,Wed Jul 1 18:53:46 2015 UTC,"I would prefer Beauchemin simply because Sekera isn't as defensively solid as Beauchemin, and right now that is what we need from our D core."
EdmontonOilers,3blle9,notsoyoungpadawan,1 point,Tue Jun 30 06:14:29 2015 UTC,"Beauchemin is being carried defensively by Lindholm. He has a bad tendency to go in for bodychecks that he misses and then turn into bad breaks. Without a good defensive partner, I would prefer the 29 year old defenceman over the 35 year old."
EdmontonOilers,3bkezb,stelts94,14,Mon Jun 29 23:07:11 2015 UTC,"Lombardi halted talks when he found out that whatever was terminating Richards' contract would come out? That tells me two things.   Lombardi is pretty honest, which is cool. That and I'm guessing the Kings would have been punished had it been found out that they traded him and knew whatever caused them to terminate the contract prior to the trade. Whatever the hell Richards did must be pretty damn serious if it completely stopped trade talks with two teams at the freaking draft.   That or he found out they could terminate his contract for whatever reason and avoid the buyout, saving them cap space which is a possibility."
EdmontonOilers,3bkezb,shweet44722,5,Mon Jun 29 23:37:09 2015 UTC,I prefer to think of Lombardi as an upstanding guy. He did trade Ryan Smyth back to the Oilers.
EdmontonOilers,3bkezb,azure_888,2,Tue Jun 30 04:41:50 2015 UTC,"It makes hating the Kings a little harder, but easier to deal with them winning at the same time, so I'm okay going with that theory."
EdmontonOilers,3bkezb,shweet44722,4,Tue Jun 30 04:50:18 2015 UTC,"Apparently it was because of some ""off ice antics"""
EdmontonOilers,3bkezb,shweet44722,4,Mon Jun 29 23:41:13 2015 UTC,"I'd imagine it'd have to be to warrant a termination that they think will be valid.  Wondering what it could be. There's been no reports of arrests or anything which seems to accompany off ice antics quite a bit, and I don't think being casually late to practice or having a massive ego would cause a GM to suddenly turn his back on two interested parties, especially if he was trying to rid himself of a locker room cancer."

EdmontonOilers,3bkezb,Eyo27,1 point,Tue Jun 30 00:49:49 2015 UTC,Both McKenzie and Rishaug have said that Chia will most probably be looking to add a veteran forward as well from UFA.
EdmontonOilers,3bkezb,notsoyoungpadawan,2,Tue Jun 30 00:47:06 2015 UTC,"I'm gonna take a guess that, if anything, we'll likely (hopefully) pick up a LW seeing as we don't exactly have a 3rd one right now. I mean Draisaitl is a possibility, but if management are set on having him season in the minors with Nurse then they may be looking for another LW."
EdmontonOilers,3bkezb,shweet44722,2,Tue Jun 30 01:52:55 2015 UTC,I hope its Williams or Ward.
EdmontonOilers,3bkezb,notsoyoungpadawan,1 point,Tue Jun 30 03:32:19 2015 UTC,Vermette is a UFA too.
EdmontonOilers,3bkezb,shweet44722,1 point,Tue Jun 30 03:51:37 2015 UTC,"Vermette would be great, but I think there's a good chance he signs with the Hawks. They'll want to retain him, especially if they're losing Oduya and/or Seabrook. Mind you, he wasn't phenomenal for them and you never know..."
EdmontonOilers,3bkezb,classyinthecorners,2,Tue Jun 30 04:41:30 2015 UTC,"I read somewhere that they're probably not going to renew Vermette and he should hit free agency. They don't have the cap space to renew his contract either I don't think.  He wasn't phenomenal during the course of his Hawks career, but he was amazing in the SCF. Plus he's a defensive forward who gets points, so he should be a positive influence on this team, and he can play in a couple of different positions too."
EdmontonOilers,3bkezb,falsekoala,1 point,Tue Jun 30 06:11:11 2015 UTC,"Hm, interesting then.  True, but for the money we'll have to spend on him, is he going to be worth sticking on Lander's left? Because atm that's where he seems to fit, unless we get rid of Purcell or move Yakupov down to the 3rd line.  I don't know if Vermette is a great fit. There's a few teams who will want his services and they'll likely be more willing to pay big money and play him in position. I mean it may be worth a look, but he's not high on my list if I'm honest. Course he's a vet, and if Chia was interested in Richards you never know."
EdmontonOilers,3bkezb,notsoyoungpadawan,1 point,Tue Jun 30 06:15:23 2015 UTC,"He's a face-beast too. Which always helps your team, (even just to mentor Mcdavid and help nuge out with face offs) good things happen when you start with the puck :)"
EdmontonOilers,3bl2ov,haterbehatin,11,Tue Jun 30 02:27:19 2015 UTC,Visentin is definitely worth looking at. Worst case he plays in the ECHL or backup to Brossoit. Best case he gets his groove back and is pushing for NHL time.
EdmontonOilers,3bl2ov,YouJagaloon,6,Tue Jun 30 03:13:43 2015 UTC,Especially without Bunz in the system anymore.
EdmontonOilers,3bl2ov,Meowingtons-PhD,3,Tue Jun 30 03:16:35 2015 UTC,"Yeah he seems like he'd be a good third to push Brossoit and Eetu, somebody has to play in Norfolk so Bunz and Bachman out and Visentin and Eetu in.   The other potential option for that could be one of the undrafted guys like Appleby although the advantage with Visentin is he's further along and you're not obligated to sign him for three years."
EdmontonOilers,3bl2ov,tsn123456789,3,Tue Jun 30 03:26:34 2015 UTC,No thanks. He was out the entire 14-15 season with an ankle injury and he had terrible AHL numbers the two years before. He's at best a ECHL guy at this point but there's guys with higher upside than him.
EdmontonOilers,3bl2ov,Meowingtons-PhD,2,Tue Jun 30 04:23:51 2015 UTC,there's guys with higher upside than him.   Like? Genuinely asking.
EdmontonOilers,3bl2ov,tsn123456789,2,Tue Jun 30 04:47:29 2015 UTC,"Honestly using Visentin as a bar isn't really great. The guy is 23 and missed an entire year of development, we're probably looking at one year to get back into things and one year to makeup for the essentially two years lost before he can even get back on track.  Appleby's already mentioned. I would even take a shot at Godla before Visentin or try to convince one of the KHL goalies to come over (Garipov for instance or even Nilsson) or try to nab a guy like Hellberg out of Nashville."
EdmontonOilers,3bl2ov,ProfessorScribbles,6,Tue Jun 30 05:05:57 2015 UTC,I think it'd be fun to get Riley Nash back.
EdmontonOilers,3bl2ov,ProfessorScribbles,2,Tue Jun 30 03:20:42 2015 UTC,They didn't qualify him? That's surprising I thought he was doing well there.   He didn't want to sign to begin with though so I'd be surprised if he'd want to be an Oiler particularly with no clear role available.
EdmontonOilers,3bl2ov,YouJagaloon,2,Tue Jun 30 03:37:49 2015 UTC,Could grab him for the 3rd line LW spot. It'd be interesting if nothing else to contemplate.
EdmontonOilers,3bl2ov,paul-mccartney,7,Tue Jun 30 03:52:45 2015 UTC,We're trying to get out of the basement. Picking up other basement teams' castoffs to actually play in the NHL isn't going to do that. If we can't grab a two-way veteran in free agency that spot should go to Draisaitl or Slephyshev with cushy zone starts.
EdmontonOilers,3bl2ov,AlleyBj,1 point,Tue Jun 30 03:56:08 2015 UTC,"I think Slephyshev will need time in Bakersfield.   Actually I'm not totally opposed to the third line being Purcell-Lander-Pitlick  I think things get complicated if they don't want to run Hall-McDavid-Yakupov because I like Pitlick but don't am not certain he should play on the 2nd line and I don't like the idea of moving either Yakupov or Pitlick to left wing.   Nash seems to be good defensively not great offensively so I'm surprised they cut him lose, looks like a decent enough role player."
EdmontonOilers,3bl2ov,A5hcrack,1 point,Tue Jun 30 15:02:38 2015 UTC,"They didn't qualify him? Wow, I missed that one.   He seemed to be doing decent in Carolina but still. 25 points on a lottery team doesn't exactly work in your favour at the bargaining table."
EdmontonOilers,3bl2ov,Meowingtons-PhD,3,Wed Jul 1 18:00:13 2015 UTC,I haven't really read up on who hasn't been qualified but anyone that could play 3 LW for cheap would be nice assuming Drai isn't ready next year. (He said he could 100% play wing)
EdmontonOilers,3bl2ov,shweet44722,3,Tue Jun 30 04:34:14 2015 UTC,"Yanick Weber would at or near the top of my list. When he got playing time last year he was great. Solid PP QB for them, and when he was paired with Hamhuis their possession numbers both skyrocketed. I think there's a player there and a pretty good price point."
EdmontonOilers,3bl2ov,Meowingtons-PhD,3,Tue Jun 30 18:06:38 2015 UTC,Arcobello!
EdmontonOilers,3bl2ov,shweet44722,6,Tue Jun 30 03:11:10 2015 UTC,He wasn't qualified? Who the flying fuck do the Coyotes have at centre after trading Gagner and not qualifying Arco?  Other than Strome of course.
EdmontonOilers,3bl2ov,AsOneAce11,2,Tue Jun 30 04:37:39 2015 UTC,"¯\_(ツ)_/¯  General Fanager says they have Vitale, Hanzal, and Chipchura left under contract. So...."
EdmontonOilers,3bl2ov,shweet44722,6,Tue Jun 30 04:40:41 2015 UTC,"lol.  I know we can't really comment on centre depth after what we started this past season with...but god damn Arizona. Cap circumvention, trading their top centreman and not qualifying Arco, who at one point was their 1C for a couple weeks this past season. Then again, that was likely tanking as much as anything else."
EdmontonOilers,3bl2ov,AsOneAce11,1 point,Tue Jun 30 04:45:19 2015 UTC,"Why not bring him in and see if he still has the touch he showed in Arizona? If not, trade for a low pick!"
EdmontonOilers,3bl2ov,shweet44722,2,Tue Jun 30 05:15:06 2015 UTC,"Because Arco isn't better than any of our centreman currently filling up the 4 NHL spots and he'd still have to compete with Draisaitl if anyone. Maybe try him on the wing, but I'm guessing Chiarelli is going to look for more veteran players, seeing as he was looking for Richards at the draft and he's a centre as well."

EdmontonOilers,3bjtfm,tsn123456789,2,Mon Jun 29 21:37:37 2015 UTC,Reading your headline I immediately got panicked that something like this had happened to us.
EdmontonOilers,3bjtfm,notsoyoungpadawan,1 point,Tue Jun 30 06:13:33 2015 UTC,wtf was the point in getting Ross?
EdmontonOilers,3bjtfm,Man_Without_Fear,12,Mon Jun 29 20:51:40 2015 UTC,So we basically traded Marty to Leafs for #107. And basically traded Marincin + Ewanyk for Gryba. That's a bad return.
EdmontonOilers,3bjtfm,notsoyoungpadawan,12,Mon Jun 29 21:03:58 2015 UTC,Sucks when you think that it started at the 21st overall pick in 2007.
EdmontonOilers,3bjtfm,ABirdOfParadise,4,Mon Jun 29 21:09:23 2015 UTC,"Well, I don't think that should be taken into consideration too much because just because Marincin was a 21st overall pick shouldn't reflect this trade because talents don't always develop in the manner they're supposed to. It happens all the time in sports. In an perfect ideal vacuum environment you would be right, but there are so many factors that affect the development of a young player, especially a defenceman. And towards the end there it was clear that there were issues with his work ethic, since he was out of shape and getting benched by an AHL team etc."
EdmontonOilers,3bjtfm,goilers97,7,Mon Jun 29 22:14:10 2015 UTC,Marincin wasn't a 21st overall
EdmontonOilers,3bjtfm,LunarLion,3,Mon Jun 29 22:31:54 2015 UTC,Yeah pretty sure he went 46th

EdmontonOilers,3bjtfm,A5hcrack,6,Mon Jun 29 21:33:31 2015 UTC,"Leafs were at 50 contracts apparently, they couldn't take on a contract without moving one"
EdmontonOilers,3bjtfm,LevSmash,17,Mon Jun 29 21:36:50 2015 UTC,"Those are the only 3 guys I wanted to get offers, so I'm happy.   As much as we all shit on him, I really hope Schultz has a good year. With McLellan coming in and Chia making moves to strengthen our D-core, I think he'll bounce back. Todd will be able to get a lot more out of him than Eakins did I think. Eakins gave Schultz way too many minutes and forced him to play out of his comfort zone. If Todd can use him solely for 5 on 5 and the PP, I think he'll have his best year as an Oiler.  Pitlick was good for us when he played, but he didn't play all that much. If he can stay healthy, I think he can be a good depth/energy player for us.  Davidson is good as well. He still needs to develop more, but I believe he can be a future 5/6 D-man for us if all goes well."
EdmontonOilers,3bjtfm,El_reverso,7,Mon Jun 29 20:38:30 2015 UTC,I think I can speak for the Schultz haters when I say that we now also hope he has a good year. I'd rather the team win than I be right about how terrible Schultz is.
EdmontonOilers,3bjtfm,haterbehatin,3,Mon Jun 29 21:07:58 2015 UTC,"Yep. Hater here, and I sincerely hope he improves. The better he does in an Oilers uniform, the better it is for everyone. Anything to sweep away the reputation of being a laughing stock, both him personally and the team, is a good thing."
EdmontonOilers,3bjtfm,parecon,2,Mon Jun 29 21:17:26 2015 UTC,"I'm not really a Schultz hater, I've always liked his offensive upside. I hated the way Eakins used him, but MacT didn't give Eakins anyone to play ahead of him. Eakins loved to ride his horses. He basically rode Schultz into the ground, burnt him out and destroyed the confidence Justin had built in the lockout season. My friend and I talk about this on many occasions. Eakins was the worst possible thing to happen to the team during this rebuild. He stagnated the play of all the young players and cost many o them confidence."
EdmontonOilers,3bjtfm,learn2die101,9,Tue Jun 30 12:00:24 2015 UTC,I thought Curtis Hamilton might've done enough to land himself another contract but other than that I'm glad they kept the three they did and let the rest go.
EdmontonOilers,3bjtfm,parecon,6,Mon Jun 29 20:26:06 2015 UTC,Couldn't agree more.  I thought he brought speed and physicality that is much needed on our roster.
EdmontonOilers,3bjtfm,shweet44722,5,Mon Jun 29 22:23:13 2015 UTC,"I think they see him as an AHL lifer, so let him walk."
EdmontonOilers,3bjtfm,paul-mccartney,2,Mon Jun 29 22:26:11 2015 UTC,"Too bad he didn't get more of a shot.  He got thrown out of the one game early and I didn't see much more of him, unfortunately."
EdmontonOilers,3bjtfm,VanPerstrings,1 point,Mon Jun 29 23:00:13 2015 UTC,"That was actually the only game he played for the Oil this year apparently.  He'll probably get a shot elsewhere. He's still fairly young, was at about 0.5PPG for the Barons this season and is a good sized player."
EdmontonOilers,3bjtfm,YouJagaloon,9,Mon Jun 29 23:51:34 2015 UTC,"No surprises there.  I'm really disappointed with how Bunz has turned out. I mean, the writing has been on the wall for the past year, but it still sucks. I remember really liking him during his time in Medicine Hat and thought that he was robbed of a spot on the WJC team a few years back."
EdmontonOilers,3bjtfm,bigfatphony,3,Mon Jun 29 21:50:58 2015 UTC,Former WHL Goalie of the Year...
EdmontonOilers,3bjtfm,ksieben,5,Mon Jun 29 23:30:25 2015 UTC,Schultz and Davidson were a given. I'm a little surprised they qualified Pitlick given his injury troubles but I'm glad they did. If he stays healthy he can be a good energy player.   No Fraser is interesting considering how little depth we have on the wings. He probably wanted a 1 way contract that management didnt want to pay for a fringe guy.
EdmontonOilers,3bjtfm,But-Seriously-Though,6,Mon Jun 29 20:26:28 2015 UTC,"We've got decent depth on wing right now:  LW: Hall, Pouliot, Purcell, Hendricks, Pakarainen RW: Eberle, Yakupov, Pitlick, Klinkhammer  All those guys have shown much more than Fraser did in his time here. And with either McDavid or Draisaitl likely to start out on the wing, things get really crowded really quick."
EdmontonOilers,3bjtfm,Shottaz83,8,Mon Jun 29 21:10:17 2015 UTC,Not to mention Chia was the one who put him on waivers last season
EdmontonOilers,3bjtfm,Loire55,4,Mon Jun 29 21:53:59 2015 UTC,why did we trade marincin for ross only to not sign him?
EdmontonOilers,3bjtfm,But-Seriously-Though,11,Mon Jun 29 20:39:29 2015 UTC,Because we used the pick we got to land Gryba in return. Doing so also frees up a roster spot.
EdmontonOilers,3bjtfm,Namtsua,9,Mon Jun 29 20:44:46 2015 UTC,To get the 107 so we could trade it for Gryba. Taking Ross of Toronto's hands was for Toronto's benefit.
EdmontonOilers,3bjtfm,ProfessorScribbles,5,Mon Jun 29 20:45:07 2015 UTC,why wouldnt they just let him go to free agency themselves?
EdmontonOilers,3bjtfm,Giggleplex,7,Mon Jun 29 20:49:36 2015 UTC,They might have been planning a trade and didn't want to gain an extra contract
EdmontonOilers,3bjtfm,bigfatphony,7,Mon Jun 29 21:00:00 2015 UTC,No contract room. They had to lose a contract to take another one.

EdmontonOilers,3bjtfm,bigfatphony,-1,Mon Jun 29 20:44:11 2015 UTC,I don't get this either. What did the Leafs gain from trading him? The only way I can see this making any sense is if the Leafs somehow still retained his rights even without a QO because he's in Europe?   Weird.

The qualifying offer is the club issuing a 1 year offer at that guaranteed salary to retain control of the player.  RFAs making under $660k are guaranteed a 10% raise, under $1M are guaranteed a 5% raise, and players making over $1M are guaranteed at least their salary from the previous year.

EdmontonOilers,3bjt6z,notsoyoungpadawan,3,Mon Jun 29 20:32:41 2015 UTC,"That's pretty bold. We essentially still have the same defence. Our offence too only has 1 new piece, maybe 2 if Drai is ready to make the jump. The new coach's effect also won't be as immediate as most people seem to think."
EdmontonOilers,3bjt6z,bigfatphony,1 point,Mon Jun 29 21:33:00 2015 UTC,I think for sure we're going to see an immediate effect. The team is going to be loose and relaxed going in to the season. I think we'll see that right away.

EdmontonOilers,3bj70c,teddybadman,35,Mon Jun 29 17:43:35 2015 UTC,"I don't get this fetish of LH/RH D balance. Chicago has had the best D corps over the past forever and they're loaded with LHD players playing out of position. We simply can't afford to discriminate against good players, if there is a quality LHD player out there capable of strengthening our top 4 we should go for him.   Otherwise, I only really want to see us go for Sekera in the UFA market. I'm also glad that we got Talbot so that we won't replay the scenario of overpaying for a goalie. If it comes down to trades, I'm more than willing to see us try to pull a deal for someone like Seth Jones or even Seabrook and willing to move Draisaitl, Schultz and picks to do so."
EdmontonOilers,3bj70c,envague,7,Mon Jun 29 17:54:52 2015 UTC,Speaking of Chi's LHD. How does /r/EdmontonOilers feel about Oduya?
EdmontonOilers,3bj70c,mkwong,4,Mon Jun 29 17:56:08 2015 UTC,"I think he's going to be way too expensive for a guy his age, similar to Ference."
EdmontonOilers,3bj70c,envague,5,Mon Jun 29 17:58:06 2015 UTC,He's nothing like Ference.
EdmontonOilers,3bj70c,DocDiggler,6,Mon Jun 29 17:58:58 2015 UTC,A 33 year old top 4 D-man from a championship team. Same description applied to Ference when we signed him.
EdmontonOilers,3bj70c,envague,9,Mon Jun 29 18:01:02 2015 UTC,"I'd disagree. Ference wasn't relied on as Oduya was throughout the playoffs. The Hawks won the cup with 4 d men including Oduya. I'd say Oduya was the third best D man thorughout the playoffs for the Hawks and when the Bruins won, Ference was playing third pairing minutes. He was on the decline for a period of time before we got him which isn't the case for Oduya."
EdmontonOilers,3bj70c,DocDiggler,3,Mon Jun 29 18:12:10 2015 UTC,"Not that I disagree with your stance, but Ference was a pretty big part of shutting Crosby and the Penguins PP down in 2013 ECF."
EdmontonOilers,3bj70c,HarfNarfArf,2,Mon Jun 29 19:34:59 2015 UTC,"I'm not saying Ference is a scrub but Oduya was relied on heavily and played equal quality of competition with the other three top D guys in Chicago. His job wasn't to shadow anyone, he had to defend everyone. And did a damn good job doing it and got a ring for his troubles. That period of time where they didn't think Oduya would be back because of injury would have been a game changer for the Lightning and I can't see the Hawks winning without him."
EdmontonOilers,3bj70c,DocDiggler,2,Mon Jun 29 19:43:06 2015 UTC,"You should recalibrate the chart for Ference's last season in Boston and it'll show he was in the top 4.   I'm not trying to defend his contract or quality. The fact is that players past 31 move towards decline. Oduya would help us in the short term, but as a UFA from a dynasty team he is going to command big dollars for 4+ years with a NMC attached at the least and I'd rather not repeat a Ference-type situation and look for alternatives."
EdmontonOilers,3bj70c,envague,2,Mon Jun 29 18:18:58 2015 UTC,It would be foolish to not get a guy that would improve our team for nothing but contract dollars. And my chart represents the year Ference won a Cup. He didn't have the same role as Oduya and was on the decline by the time he made his way here.   We'd only need these guys signed for a couple of years at the most anyways. After that we'd always have the option to trade. We aren't paying 5.5 x 6 for Oduya so I don't think that's an issue at all.
EdmontonOilers,3bj70c,DocDiggler,1 point,Mon Jun 29 18:34:50 2015 UTC,"Ference was coming off surgery the year Boston won the cup which affected his minutes. Ask any Bruins fan what he meant to that championship winning team and it would align with what Hawks fans would say about Oduya.   Still, we agree that Oduya is better than Ference, no question. The more central debate though is whether we should overpay in both dollars and term for another depreciating D-man rather than looking elsewhere - in which case I'd rather go for Sekera or pull a trade."
EdmontonOilers,3bj70c,envague,1 point,Mon Jun 29 18:48:12 2015 UTC,"My own opinion on priority going into free agency is to get a partner to play with Fayne. Oduya would fill that need. I think we're pretty well set on the back end and it's now into the development stages with such a young D core going forward.   We'll be in good shape cap wise next year with Purcell and Nikitin off the books so contract dollars shouldn't be much of a concern. Landing a couple guys, Sekera included would be a game changer to our season next year. I want Talbot to have a fighting chance as an Oiler."
EdmontonOilers,3bj70c,DocDiggler,1 point,Mon Jun 29 18:58:53 2015 UTC,"Ference wasn't a top 4 defenseman though, people around here just acted like he was and then he played like Ference and people realised he wasn't that guy."
EdmontonOilers,3bj70c,haterbehatin,5,Mon Jun 29 18:09:01 2015 UTC,He played top 4 minutes his last season in Boston.
EdmontonOilers,3bj70c,envague,6,Mon Jun 29 18:09:35 2015 UTC,"TBH, My fetish for LHD/RHD balance only comes from the EA games cause i like to go for one-timers from the point and that's just easier to do with one of each handedness on the blue line. I'm not 100% sold on its importance in actual gameplay, though. Detroit has a D-core of all Lefties if i'm not mistaken and they seem to be doing just fine so i don't think it's that big a deal. ...So long as the player is comfortable playing both sides. Some left handed dmen just don't play as well on the right cause they struggle to accept passes on their backhand and stuff like that.  But even if you're not looking at handedness, I still think next year's FA D crop looks better than this year's.  And I'd love to go after Sekera. I had him with the ""aging"" group in the OP but 29 really isn't that old, especially for a defenseman."
EdmontonOilers,3bj70c,firesofpompeii,3,Mon Jun 29 18:02:47 2015 UTC,"Okay so (off topic), on EA games I tend to play RHD on the right side and LHD on the left side. I find that this help out a lot more defensively, being able to defend the wide boards on an opposing rush, easier at the expense of the inside a little bit. But, it messes up one timers because all the D shoot from the outside in. It's easier to get shots off on the inside.   What do you do?"
EdmontonOilers,3bj70c,But-Seriously-Though,2,Mon Jun 29 21:51:48 2015 UTC,I do the exact opposite haha I have RHD on the left and LHD on the right. In my own zone it can cause a bit of panic but when i'm in the offensive zone it opens up a LOT cause there's always a one-timer threat and I'm more of a full-on offense kinda player. I'm more likely to win games 6-5 than like 3-2 or 2-1.
EdmontonOilers,3bj70c,envague,3,Mon Jun 29 22:14:51 2015 UTC,You can thank hockey Canada for this way of thinking because they took Hamhuis on the Olympic team over guys like Seabrook because of the hand he holds his stick with
EdmontonOilers,3bj70c,bigfatphony,1 point,Mon Jun 29 20:00:54 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I remember the controversy about playing Bouwmeester off-position in Turin and why we got knocked out so early. This is the first time I even considered that d-pairings could be composed by balance. Everyone I played hockey with growing up was left shot (I was the only one who was right)."
EdmontonOilers,3bj70c,AllisGreat,8,Mon Jun 29 20:07:25 2015 UTC,"The biggest change in our D this season will be Todd McLellan and his team. We're going to be a better defensive team this year, and we're going to be better on the PP. Our defencemen won't seem so uninspiring after this year, mark my words."
EdmontonOilers,3bj70c,vanillaacid,6,Mon Jun 29 18:36:38 2015 UTC,"No that's a terrible idea. By next trade deadline you could be looking at a whole different picture. Players could get traded, and re-signed. I'd bet most of those players won't hit free agency on July 1st, and all of a sudden you're looking at a really dry FA pool."
EdmontonOilers,3bj70c,tsn123456789,6,Mon Jun 29 19:19:12 2015 UTC,"We NEED to go for it this year. Most of those guys won't be available next year, nor is there any guarantee we could sign any of them if they are available.   Don't put off until tomorrow what you can do today."
EdmontonOilers,3bj70c,AllisGreat,6,Mon Jun 29 18:13:46 2015 UTC,Overpaying for mediocre talent is how you get screwed cap wise like Boston.
EdmontonOilers,3bj70c,vanillaacid,2,Mon Jun 29 18:26:38 2015 UTC,You hardly ever get elite talent in FA anyways. Suter/Parise doesn't happen in free agency every year.
EdmontonOilers,3bj70c,shittybillz,1 point,Mon Jun 29 19:20:25 2015 UTC,"Exactly. And while a trade for an elite D may be unlikely, Chia has to try. Kick some tires, see what's out there. If nothing comes of it, then yeah, what are you gonna do. But he can't just sit back at this point and say he's done."
EdmontonOilers,3bj70c,rBit,5,Mon Jun 29 19:47:43 2015 UTC,"Really good question. I didn't know so many top tier defensemen were available next off season. I personally am so tired of saying ""next year"" every single year. I really want us to go for it this year. Also, I don't want the oilers to kill Talbots confidence with a sub par defense. We got the goalie, we got the forwards, we just need a couple more improvements on defense and were going to be serious. This team needs to win more than it needs perfect timing to pick up better defensemen next year. Lets just go for it"
EdmontonOilers,3bj70c,Arunatic5,6,Mon Jun 29 17:57:14 2015 UTC,"Also, I don't want the oilers to kill Talbots confidence with a sub par defense.    That's another pretty serious problem I hadn't thought of. If we let him get bombarded this year then sign some great Dmen next summer, it won't really matter if our starter has become an under-confident sieve after ~60 games of getting assaulted by opposing teams."
EdmontonOilers,3bj70c,rBit,4,Mon Jun 29 18:06:03 2015 UTC,"I'd spend some money on Franson on a 3-4 year deal.  RHD, good on the power play, decent defensively according to fancy stats.  Maybe just shy of Petry money (4-5M per)?"
EdmontonOilers,3bj70c,El_reverso,5,Mon Jun 29 19:41:50 2015 UTC,He'll get more than that.
EdmontonOilers,3bj70c,A5hcrack,1 point,Mon Jun 29 19:53:55 2015 UTC,"Unfrotunately, you're probably right."
EdmontonOilers,3bj70c,El_reverso,2,Tue Jun 30 17:52:05 2015 UTC,I've been saying this for a while too. Franson played top minutes in Toronto and just fell out of favour with the coaching staff for some reason.  Colby Armstrong talked about it one time. Said he couldn't understand why Management played games with him and that very often Franson was the best D-man on the ice for them.
EdmontonOilers,3bj70c,A5hcrack,3,Mon Jun 29 20:34:22 2015 UTC,"He fell out of favor because the pairing of him and Pfaneuf was a train wreck. Pfaneuf was playing on the side he's less comfortable, and isn't as good offensively. So they were playing two offensive defenseman against top competition, and one of them was playing his off side (by player preference, not handedness).   Huge part of how Carlyle got himself fired despite having his team in 8the place in the east."
EdmontonOilers,3bj70c,El_reverso,1 point,Mon Jun 29 20:42:10 2015 UTC,Exactly. Franson was never given a fair chance to succeed. I think he could perform very well opposite Klefbom. I think a pairing combo of; Klefbom - Franson Nurse/Reinhart/Nikitin - Fayne/Schultz Ference/Nurse/Reinhart - Schultz/Gryba Could potentially be enough to compete hard next year.
EdmontonOilers,3bj70c,bumbuff,2,Mon Jun 29 21:02:08 2015 UTC,"A significant step up by Klefbom and Franson would be required for it to be a good top pair, he's not exactly an Elite shut down guy, just the best we've got. Franson's treatment by the Leafs reminds me of how Petry was treated by the Oilers. I think that given a better team and yes I would call the Oilers roster better than the leafs right now, he could thrive."
EdmontonOilers,3bj70c,putzeh,1 point,Mon Jun 29 21:18:23 2015 UTC,"Exactly. I don't expect them to dominate. Just build some chemistry and show signs of growth. They could compliment each other really well and both have size, even though Franson doesn't play that gritty. As you said, he's more of an offensive guy."
EdmontonOilers,3bj70c,falsekoala,1 point,Mon Jun 29 21:57:41 2015 UTC,How much hate would you have for the Flames if they picked up Franson?
EdmontonOilers,3bj70c,VanPerstrings,2,Tue Jun 30 06:36:23 2015 UTC,"Cody Franson should be a target. Big RHD. Has some scoring touch, plays similar to Fayne. Can be physical sometimes."
EdmontonOilers,3bj70c,A5hcrack,2,Mon Jun 29 21:35:33 2015 UTC,Chiarelli isn't done on D yet. More tweaks will come. My only fear is overpaying a UFA.
EdmontonOilers,3bj70c,haterbehatin,2,Mon Jun 29 23:29:26 2015 UTC,"Let's be honest, the Oilers have the worst defense in the league at the moment and if it doesn't get fixed this offseason, they'll be in the running for Austin Matthews."
EdmontonOilers,3bj70c,A5hcrack,1 point,Mon Jun 29 19:32:22 2015 UTC,"Standing pat is insane. But they have to get guys who fit, not just bodies willing to sign. That's how they got Nikitin, Ference and Fayne. I'd rather have a four million dollar player at 6, than a 2 million dollar player at 4. It's the same overspend but one of them actually helps your team and the other stunts the development of your prospects by holding down a lower role. Would you rather have Pfaneuf or Nikitin? Because in free agency that's your two choices other than old men."
EdmontonOilers,3bj70c,haterbehatin,2,Mon Jun 29 20:45:36 2015 UTC,I don't think Fayne fits with those others.  Phaneuf or Nikitin on the deals they have now I'll take Nikitin every single time.
EdmontonOilers,3bj70c,A5hcrack,3,Mon Jun 29 23:21:46 2015 UTC,"Well that's where we differ. I'd rather have the player that has some ability to contribute to an NHL team. I'm not saying they're not both shit sandwiches, because they are, but Pfaneuf is at least a player who deserves to be on an NHL roster. Nikitin isn't. Put Pfaneuf back in an offensive defenseman role in stead of a shutdown role and his deal isn't so bad."
EdmontonOilers,3bj70c,classyinthecorners,1 point,Tue Jun 30 01:20:24 2015 UTC,"The problem with Phaneuf is contract, I'm not on board with moves that make the team slightly better now but also most definitely harm the team in the future.  That's what Phaneuf is, Nikitin on the hand sucks now but is gone after only 1 more season."
EdmontonOilers,3bj70c,acompletesmeghead,2,Tue Jun 30 01:41:20 2015 UTC,"The amount cap space of terrible contracts (players who add nothing a prospect already in the system couldn't provide) coming off the books in the next two seasons is over 20 million. It's about a four year period before serious money is going to need to be thrown around to retain anyone but talbot next season, Yak in two years. And McDavid's bridge deal in three. Ebs and Pouliot in four. The cap isn't going to be an issue until at least then. If it keeps going up, not at all."

EdmontonOilers,3bjar3,notsoyoungpadawan,17,Mon Jun 29 18:10:13 2015 UTC,"The thing I've heard about Reinhart is that his Hockey sense is by far the best aspect of his game. That to me is the most important part. The fact that his skating isn't incredible doesn't bother me as much, because that can be improved, whereas elite Hockey sense is something you either have or don't. If he can improve his skating, he can be a future top 4 D-Man for us."
EdmontonOilers,3bjar3,Shottaz83,6,Mon Jun 29 18:21:10 2015 UTC,"His skating is actually pretty good for his size. He's not as agile as say,  Klefbom, but he's got a larger wingspan to compensate."
EdmontonOilers,3bjar3,0ILERS,3,Mon Jun 29 19:45:20 2015 UTC,"I have to agree with this. Plus, big slow defensemen can sometimes grow into their big ugly stride once they reach comfortability at the NHL level."
EdmontonOilers,3bjar3,HarfNarfArf,2,Mon Jun 29 19:38:05 2015 UTC,Good hockey sense can help him overcome his skating ability as well. Obviously it will hurt him every now and then but if he knows how the plays developing it becomes much less of an issue.
EdmontonOilers,3bjar3,CeleryDistraction,2,Mon Jun 29 19:39:40 2015 UTC,"When people say his skating is bad does that mean his technique sucks, or he just doesn't have the leg strength/power/endurance and aerobic/aerobic capacity?"
EdmontonOilers,3bjar3,edmonton3,1 point,Mon Jun 29 22:07:53 2015 UTC,"He has a good stride, so I'm guessing the problem is that he lacks the leg strength. He said it himself that he needed to improve his lower body strength.  It's not his top speed that is bad, it's his acceleration. A similar problem with Draisaitl, too."
EdmontonOilers,3bjar3,Giggleplex,7,Tue Jun 30 00:03:27 2015 UTC,"The more I hear about him, the more he sorta reminds me of Seabrook. If he can improve his skating, I could see him being that sort of player."
EdmontonOilers,3bjar3,RedOilSaints,5,Mon Jun 29 19:58:12 2015 UTC,"I find that to be a pretty ridiculous thing to say. Brent Seabrook is a world class defensemen who averages 30-40 points per season. Nothing at all suggests Reinhart could be that caliber of player, we will be lucky if Reinhart turns out to be half the player Seabrook is."
EdmontonOilers,3bjar3,Dallash717,1 point,Tue Jun 30 00:56:29 2015 UTC,You're reading way too much into a comparison of playing styles. It's similar to every draft where prospects are compared to players. All I'm doing is comparing his playing styles. I'm not saying he's going to be as good as Seabrook.
EdmontonOilers,3bjar3,RedOilSaints,0,Tue Jun 30 06:11:53 2015 UTC,If he becomes a Seabrook would the trade be worth it?
EdmontonOilers,3bjar3,Giggleplex,2,Tue Jun 30 00:00:06 2015 UTC,would trading a 16th and 33rd pick be worth acquiring Brent Seabrook...? How is this even a question? He is without question one of the best defenseman in the league. If Reinhart is anywhere near that caliber of player (which seems unlikely) this would be a huge steal.
EdmontonOilers,3bjar3,GetStapled,0,Tue Jun 30 02:01:12 2015 UTC,That's...not going to happen.  His best case scenario is...20 points a year.  And that's if everything breaks juuuuuuuuust right.  I see him potting 8-15 a la Fayne.
EdmontonOilers,3bjar3,Dr_Marxist,2,Tue Jun 30 14:07:13 2015 UTC,"I'm very, very okay with that statement."
EdmontonOilers,3bj6sr,Finn_the_human_buoy,11,Mon Jun 29 17:42:00 2015 UTC,"Hopefully we target Sekera, and possibly even Beauchimen or Ehrhoff. If we can get them for 2-3 years I'd be pretty happy."
EdmontonOilers,3bj6sr,Shottaz83,7,Mon Jun 29 17:59:03 2015 UTC,Sekara for the right price for 2-3 years would be a big win in my mind
EdmontonOilers,3bj6sr,crazycatman69,2,Mon Jun 29 18:06:35 2015 UTC,"With Nikitin and Purcell done after this season, it frees up a ton of cap space. So I wouldn't mind signing him for pretty high, as long as it isn't more than 3 years. Even something like $4.5-5 Million per would be perfectly fine."
EdmontonOilers,3bj6sr,Shottaz83,6,Mon Jun 29 18:10:35 2015 UTC,Even something like $4.5-5 Million per would be perfectly fine.   You're not getting Sekera at 5M and 2-3 years if Petry is getting a 5.5x6 and guys like Soderberg 4.75x5 and Niemi 4.5x3. A lot of teams will screw themselves by overpaying for a weak FA crop.

EdmontonOilers,3bj6sr,RedOilSaints,1 point,Mon Jun 29 19:44:35 2015 UTC,"Even five would be fine.  He has value and is reasonably young, and could always be traded for picks later as long as his rate isn't too high."

EdmontonOilers,3bj6sr,shittybillz,1 point,Mon Jun 29 18:58:51 2015 UTC,"Of those guys I see Ehrhoff coming in at the cheapest price point, even if it's for something like what we gave Ference a couple years ago, except a NTC instead of NMC, if we need to. He's had a string of underwhelming seasons that would have brought down his price, but I think he can bring it back to something resembling what he had in Vancouver."
EdmontonOilers,3bj6sr,9Bains,5,Mon Jun 29 23:24:39 2015 UTC,"I'd target D Andrej Sekera for 6 years. The guy has been an absolute rock defensively and is by far the best D-man on the market. He's a good #2. Can play both sides. Can play in all situations.   In advanced metrics, hasn't put up a negative CF% in like 6 years."
EdmontonOilers,3bj6sr,RedOilSaints,1 point,Mon Jun 29 19:47:31 2015 UTC,"Be prepared to pay $5.5 for 6, easily more. Petry is a decent comparable, and you know teams like Buffalo will be pursuing him hard. Too much imo."

EdmontonOilers,3bj6sr,RedOilSaints,2,Tue Jun 30 06:15:35 2015 UTC,I'd be okay with Oduya if the term is good. Him and Fayne would be a pretty adequate shutdown pairing. I'm more so hoping we can pick up some decent defenseman right before training camp the way NYI did with Boychuk and Leddy.

Martin for more money less term if needed, ideally of course low money, low term, 2 players for less than $12 mil hopefully. Schultz if he'll take the same, or less (which he won't) money.  Nurse it the call up, hopefully can unseat Ference. Ference is there cause I don't think he can be moved.  Martin/Sekara - Franson/Green  Klefbom - Fayne  Ference - Gryba  Nurse - Schultz"
EdmontonOilers,3bj6sr,ABirdOfParadise,1 point,Mon Jun 29 20:36:12 2015 UTC,"I think we'll be targeting quite a few. We have enough chefs in the ""front office"" kitchen that we should be able to toss out our fair share of lines.   I just think that Chiarelli is far more comfortable trading our way to players than overpaying for a UFA. Which, is actually what I prefer.   Though, Franson and Green are two UFAs I like."
EdmontonOilers,3biazc,RedOilSaints,11,Mon Jun 29 13:29:16 2015 UTC,"I know a few people aren't sold on Reinhart (and not to say I am too), but this eased my nerves a fair bit. It's based on his NHL stint (brief as it was) and it's from a guy like Willis, someone who knows their hockey.   It's broken down into different areas so we can clearly see how he shapes up into each area. I thought it was worth sharing."
EdmontonOilers,3biazc,wildcard_bitches,9,Mon Jun 29 13:30:34 2015 UTC,"Personally I am cautiously optimistic.  I have a hard time writing off any player that is 21 years old, especially a defense man!  He may not ever live up to his 4th overall hype, but I certainly see him as a workhorse type player that has many of the skills the Oilers have sorely lacked for awhile...size, strength, defensively minded."
EdmontonOilers,3biazc,LevSmash,2,Mon Jun 29 15:26:04 2015 UTC,"Same here. Yes, Hamilton is farther ahead in his development and therefore would have helped us out more immediately, but Reinhart is a year younger. My cautious optimism is that Reinhart could be following along the same path. If so, this would be the year he could take a big step in his game (and yes, making absolute hypothetical comparisons). With better coaching and more opportunity, he is an interesting storyline for me going into this year."
EdmontonOilers,3biazc,IGOR_ULANOV_55_BEST,2,Mon Jun 29 16:39:19 2015 UTC,"I honestly don't think it matters that Reinhart is a year younger. Do you take a 32 year old Johnny Boychuk over a 33 year old healthy Chris Pronger?  I think there's still room for him to be an above average player, but if he was going to become the perennial Norris candidate that Hamilton will be I think we would have seen more out of him by now. I'm being cautiously optimistic that we've got a Roman Hamrlik v.2.0 on our hands."
EdmontonOilers,3biazc,LevSmash,5,Mon Jun 29 19:40:27 2015 UTC,"When they're this early in their careers, a year is a bigger deal, yes. A lot can change in a year when a young player is adjusting to the pro level. Like if one player has 3 years experience and the other has 2, that's 50% more experience. But if one player has 11 years experience and the other has 10, the first guy only has 10% more.  But I see what you're saying. And honestly, I liked Roman Hamrlik, so I'll take it! Haha"
EdmontonOilers,3biazc,putzeh,8,Mon Jun 29 20:05:39 2015 UTC,"I tried finding some posession numbers from his junior career.  I was a Oil King season ticket holder and one observation watching him play, he was a posession monster. Always seemed to come away with the puck.  As he learns the game at the NHL level, if he can adapt enough, he should return to strong posession numbers.  Really it's a sink or swim, with high potential."
EdmontonOilers,3biazc,StealAllTheInternets,5,Mon Jun 29 14:23:44 2015 UTC,He sounds excited to be moved here so that should hopefully help.
EdmontonOilers,3biazc,oddspellingofPhreid,3,Mon Jun 29 17:04:28 2015 UTC,"I like Reinhart but I don't think he has the potential to be the elite player that (in my opinion) the #16 and #33 in this draft is worth. I see the #16 and #33 in this draft are closer to the #7-10 and #18-25 in most other drafts. Lots of amazing talents left on the board. To me, Reinhart would have been a late first round talent in this draft.  When I think Reinhart's top end I think of a rich man's Mark Fayne. A solid #3, maybe, maybe, maybe #2 who (usually) shuts down top players and puts between 10-20 points a season. Great player but not elite.  Reinhart might have the talent to win this trade but it's not a bet I would have made."
EdmontonOilers,3biazc,oddspellingofPhreid,4,Mon Jun 29 20:07:03 2015 UTC,"See I disagree. Honestly at first thought I was pretty disappointed with the trade, but given more time, I've warmed up to it significantly.   The highest comparison I can find IF he can fix his skating is Seabrook, but a far more likely comparison in my opinion is Alzner. A guy who has terrific hockey sense defensively, and while won't put up a ton of points, but can make a break out pass and has a decent shot. That is worth the 16th and 33rd to me.   I'm ok with making this bet because we've done a tonne of homework on this one. Between Green's extensive history, and Chia mentioning they've monitored him for a while, add in this organizations favoring him, I think they've literally gone about this through every angle. If he ends up as an Alzner for us, it's a VERY good bet we made."
EdmontonOilers,3biazc,El_reverso,2,Mon Jun 29 20:29:47 2015 UTC,I agree if he turns into Seabrook that would be awesome. Totally worth the trade.
EdmontonOilers,3biazc,oddspellingofPhreid,1 point,Mon Jun 29 21:44:47 2015 UTC,"We won't know until he plays, but it seems to me that the Islanders were never high on Reinhart anyway.  Remember that draft? They tried to trade every pick they had for the #2 spot, in order to grab Murray. They never even met with him before drafting him. They gave off the sense of dissatisfaction from the start. Here Reinhart will be encouraged to flourish, and held to higher expectations. This regime will do it right though. They'll find the right people to surround him with."
EdmontonOilers,3biazc,A5hcrack,2,Tue Jun 30 02:32:24 2015 UTC,Which also never made sense because the rankings all had reinhart around 7-16 ish. It was a reach pick for a guy they didn't seem to like.

EdmontonOilers,3bi904,shweet44722,2,Mon Jun 29 21:51:01 2015 UTC,I think this is exactly what's going to happen. The reason that there's rookie camp/the Penticton rookie tournament/pre-season is to see what the new guys are like in different situations.
EdmontonOilers,3bi904,speedonthis,1 point,Mon Jun 29 21:59:24 2015 UTC,I wouldn't say he's NHL ready mentally. He needs to build some of his old confidence back. If he's brought up and gets skinned in his first game that could have a more lasting effect that his season in the AHL.

Big, gritty, good speed. Sign Kristo 1.5x2 two-way deal: Danny Kristo is a 25 year old Rangers prospect. He has very respectable numbers in the AHL, and has immense, blazing speed.

EdmontonOilers,3bi904,Ferocian,6,Mon Jun 29 16:22:05 2015 UTC,Gryba is a bottom-pairing defenceman and was brought here to fill that role.

EdmontonOilers,3bh3k9,Jon_Cake,3,Mon Jun 29 06:34:42 2015 UTC,This is why I take anything from SI with a grain of salt (in regards to hockey.)  I'll only follow for the swim suits.
EdmontonOilers,3bh3k9,putzeh,8,Mon Jun 29 14:30:32 2015 UTC,"Meh, I definitely dont think we deserve an A+, Id say a B at best. The only reason we would even get a grade like that is because of drafting McDavid. The reason I dont think we had an amazing draft is because I feel like we made a couple of mistakes or overpayed in some of the trades. I think that we overpayed a little too much on the Reinhart trade, and Im pretty sure we could of got it done for mabey #16 and a prospect. I do wish we did more drafting this year and mabey have used our #16 on Barzal ( although we dont really need another center, he is just too good to pass up on for dropping to #16). I also really think that we mabey should have kept our #57 and drafted Kylington, or just got him somehow. The Talbot trade wasnt that bad tbh, but Im still slightly questioning the Marincin trade.   All in all It wasnt that bad of a draft (especially with McDavid), but it could have been better."
EdmontonOilers,3bh3k9,Scyse,2,Mon Jun 29 05:03:46 2015 UTC,"I agree with you for the most part. I didn't like trading Marincin for so little, and overpaid for Reinhart. Talbot came cheap enough so it was a good trade, although risky because we are relying on an unproven goalie again.   The part where I disagree is wanting to keep our draft picks. I was/am a supporter of trading the picks for help now. We need to start improving the roster so we can be competitive while we can still afford all of our stars. We are stacked at Center so why keep Barzal? Trade him for immediate help. My problem with what went down was I don't feel we got fair value for what we have up."
EdmontonOilers,3bh3k9,vanillaacid,2,Mon Jun 29 15:05:06 2015 UTC,"Yeah I know what you mean, but the only reason I would want to do more drafting is because this draft class was just so deep. It would have been nice to draft even a second rounder instead of trading them all"
EdmontonOilers,3bgmbz,notsoyoungpadawan,6,Mon Jun 29 01:27:10 2015 UTC,People have to realize too that he played on one of the worst teams in the ahl. Hard to play great when your team isn't
EdmontonOilers,3bgmbz,PuIp,9,Mon Jun 29 04:38:44 2015 UTC,"I feel like we used our first round (besides McDavid obviously) and a bit of our second just to ultimately switch prospects in Maricin and Reinhart, and that worries me honestly. I don't think it's a clear L (like the Bruins), but I feel like we could've done more with those picks in a deep draft like it was this year.  I think Bob kinda looks at Reinhart, like I do with a lot of girls from my past... I just hope we don't end up regretting it like I usually end up doing."
EdmontonOilers,3bgmbz,IGetComputersPuting,7,Mon Jun 29 02:12:38 2015 UTC,"This was a high risk high reward move. Barzal IMO is the better player but we dont have a need for him. I do feel the 33 was too high, i wouldve been more comfortable with the 57. If Reinhart can improve his skating he could be a top end 2nd pairing guy like Girardi. We certainly bought low on him though."
EdmontonOilers,3bgmbz,tsn123456789,3,Mon Jun 29 02:48:42 2015 UTC,"It was an overpayment in my mind, but had we retained the 33rd we would have shipped it to the Rangers for Talbot anyways."
EdmontonOilers,3bgmbz,parecon,1 point,Mon Jun 29 12:52:59 2015 UTC,"Not really, we would've traded down for another pick in that 50's range (or traded up into the 50's range) and given that pick to the Rangers."
EdmontonOilers,3bgmbz,tsn123456789,6,Mon Jun 29 14:57:43 2015 UTC,"I think Reinhart has more upside than Marincin and is probably a better long term prospect. Griff may have developed a bit slower than he could have but that's not unusual for Dmen, especially on a full islanders blueline.    I look at the whole draft and see they sent a bunch of picks, marincin and ewaynk (B grade prospects at best) to get Talbot, Reinhart & Gryba. Not to mention that McDavid guy. I like this situation a lot better than giving up higher end assets / keeping picks for more prospects that we can live without for the short term"
EdmontonOilers,3bgmbz,Spencerhutch,2,Mon Jun 29 03:00:37 2015 UTC,It's very concerning that he never actually saw him play with Bridgeport and he's basing his opinion off what he did in Jr.
EdmontonOilers,3bgmbz,haterbehatin,11,Mon Jun 29 02:31:11 2015 UTC,"He only played in Bridgeport for one season, and not even on their top pairing, while he spent 5 seasons at the Oil Kings where I'm sure Bob saw him in virtually every game. Plus sometimes for some players to succeed they just need to be in an environment where they're happy. I may be wrong, but I feel Reinhart is one of those types of players.  Besides, that Bridgeport team is pretty horrible. They finished last in the Eastern Conference this year and missed playoffs for the third consecutive season. Its hard for a young defenceman to succeed on a team like that."
EdmontonOilers,3bgmbz,HarfNarfArf,2,Mon Jun 29 03:16:11 2015 UTC,"Agreed. Bob drafted this kid in Bantam at 14 did he not? That's a long time for trajectory. And beside, wasn't Bob amateur scouting this past season? If so, his job isn't to watch guys like Reinhart."
EdmontonOilers,3bgmbz,Spencerhutch,4,Mon Jun 29 15:54:35 2015 UTC,"It's was Chia's call though, and he did see him play and must have liked what he saw."
EdmontonOilers,3bgmbz,McEirhead,6,Mon Jun 29 03:02:35 2015 UTC,"Well I saw him play a bit as an Oil King, and he was definitely the cornerstone of their success. Dunno if that translates into NHL success, but I was really hoping the oilers might trade for him over the last couple years. I think he's got top pairing potential for sure."
EdmontonOilers,3bgmbz,paul-mccartney,9,Mon Jun 29 01:45:02 2015 UTC,"Blaaaaaah struggled in his draft +3 year in the AHL. Just doesn't bode well for me.  I really hope to be proven wrong though. Hopefully we can get a 2-way d-man in the 3-4 hole out of him. At this point, I feel pretty comfortable saying that being a true #1 is out of his depth."
EdmontonOilers,3bgmbz,IamMcLovin2015,6,Mon Jun 29 03:02:11 2015 UTC,"Here's another way of looking at it. If Nurse went to Bakersfield next season and had an average/poor season, would you call him a bust? At the end of next season, he'll be the same age as Reinhart is this year. I personally feel like people are overreacting to his one poor year in the AHL, and to be honest, there could be a lot of factors behind why he was poor this season.  But lets be clear. He probably won't ever be a Norris trophy calibre defenceman. What I do see him being, however, is a very good top 4 D-man on a Stanley Cup winning team. If he turns into a 20-30 point shut down defenceman, an excellent leader and someone who the team can rely on for PKs, logging big minutes, etc, he will have justified his trade value. What people shouldn't be expecting out of this trade is a Shea Weber."
EdmontonOilers,3bgmbz,Colotech,9,Mon Jun 29 05:49:57 2015 UTC,"In an interview he said he mostly played well but probably not as good as he could sometimes due to confidence and he sounds really excited to come to edm and work hard. My thoughts are maybe he wasnt happy with Islanders since he was expecting to make the team and then their depth chart pushed him back out of the NHL, maybe lost some confidence. Just a thought. He is still young and I really think he could have a major impact on the Oilers so only time will tell."
EdmontonOilers,3bgmbz,AllisGreat,3,Mon Jun 29 04:27:48 2015 UTC,"Here are the bridgeport stats for last season. Every defenceman with decent pts had a negative plus/minus. However Reinhart seems either 2nd or 3rd in terms of pts. Obviously there are other lots of factors and advanced stats that might be hidden but just going on his pts he didn't stand out immensely. I hate to say it but Pulock looks really good here vs Reinhart, again thats just looking at the stats line."

EdmontonOilers,3bgmbz,0x4849,2,Mon Jun 29 01:50:34 2015 UTC,"I'm a little worried, but he is still very young and is really excited to come back to Edmonton and play. Maybe it will give him some more motivation to work hard and try and make the team."
EdmontonOilers,3bgmbz,defeatedbird,3,Mon Jun 29 05:36:39 2015 UTC,"I don't like the deal. The #16 and the #33 had real value -- if NYI wanted Barzal so bad, we should have demanded additional picks rather than throwing in another of our own. I'll avoid comparing to the Dougie Hamilton deal because that was just stupid on Boston's part, but surely we could have found somebody who had already established they could handle a top-4 defenceman role? Reinhart fills the exact same organizational role as Nurse, except Nurse has more upside as a potential #1. Plus Reinhart shoots left like every other defence prospect we have.  I guess overall my problem is that this deal has a huge opportunity cost with a bunch of risk that doesn't cleanly solve any problems. We have defence prospects, we don't have defence; I'd have much rather have seen those picks sent to Minnesota for Spurgeon (for example)."
EdmontonOilers,3bgmbz,parecon,3,Mon Jun 29 06:12:14 2015 UTC,"It really bothers me that people are labeling him a bust because he hasn't produced immediately. If you know anything about the history of the game, you'd know that there is a long line of great D-Men that struggled in their first few years as a pro, so we need to be patient with him.  I feel like he's still right on track to be the player he was expected to be. In my mind, Reinhart will probably make the team next season(as a third pairing) and he will begin his rise into becoming a top four DMan for this team. Eventually, I think that Reinhart will end up on the top pairing. Players with his high intelligence level and coolness under pressure don't come around too often.  Much like Ryan Suter, Reinhart was thought of as a very good(maybe can't miss) prospect by scouts(first DMan taken in their drafts). While Reinhart isn't the skater that Suter is, the similarities are there. When Suter first entered the NHL in 2003, he really struggled. It took him a long time to come around.  Meanwhile, Dion Phaneuf(who was drafted a few picks later) was much more quick to have a bigger impact in the NHL. As a result, fans were all over Suter with their knee-jerk reactions calling him a bust and praising Phaneuf as the obvious better draft pick.   I think that Matthew Dumba could be the Dion Phaneuf of this story as he has had a bigger early impact in the NHL from that 2012 draft class, and fans have already been quick to proclaim Dumba the better draft choice, but as history has shown repeatedly, it isn't always the guy who makes the biggest impact early on that winds up having the better career. There are countless examples that show otherwise especially when it comes to D-Men. They all tend to preach patience.  The only point that I'm trying to make is that you need to be patient with D-Men, not that Griffin Reinhart would necessarily become Ryan Suter or that Matthew Dumba would become Dion Phaneuf.  While I am less sure of Griff's potential than I was of Suter's when he was getting shit on by the the knee jerk reactions of fans, I still think that Griff will pan out. Time will tell who is right.   By the way, I think this is a pretty good recent article on Griff with a few prospect experts chiming in on him as recent as this month: http://islesbeat.com/2015/06/a-reality-check-on-griffin-reinhart/"
EdmontonOilers,3bgmbz,Boxerboy02,2,Mon Jun 29 12:56:34 2015 UTC,"Here's what bugs me about this.  Bob Green is kind of a homer on the Oil Kings.  It's possible his connection with the team clouds his judgment.  Also, remember, there were scouts that said the same thing about Cam Barker, Jack Johnson, Erik Johnson.  These aren't ""long, long ago when scouts made sure to drink a mickey and smoke a joint every game"" picks, either.  The number of high-pick defencemen who struggle to make the team out of the gate and then become impact players is pretty low.  Reinhart got passed by almost every other d-man picked in the top 10 and a few outside of it."
EdmontonOilers,3bgmbz,haterbehatin,1 point,Mon Jun 29 05:20:11 2015 UTC,"The only look I got of him was in the WJCs two? years ago, and I have to say he was very underwhelming.  Hopefully, he can reach the potential of his draft pick."
EdmontonOilers,3bg2zb,Shottaz83,8,Sun Jun 28 22:29:55 2015 UTC,The top line combination possibilities are arousing.
EdmontonOilers,3bg2zb,72douchecanoe,6,Mon Jun 29 00:23:05 2015 UTC,"I've changed my mind over the last few weeks. I really want to see him playing with Ebs on that top line along with Pouliot, rather than with Hall and Yak."
EdmontonOilers,3bg2zb,notsoyoungpadawan,6,Mon Jun 29 00:58:03 2015 UTC,How come pouliot and ebs over two goal scorers like hall and yakupov?
EdmontonOilers,3bg2zb,Muffy1234,1 point,Mon Jun 29 01:11:23 2015 UTC,"I just feel CSP's personality will fit better with Ebs than Hall. Plus Ebs is a potential 30+ goal scorer with the right partner. Sans-Hall it was quite apparent that Ebs can score a lot of goals but feels obligated to dish out when on a line with Hall. So, if CSP and Ebs form a good partnership, it could mean we add more goals to our team. Hall already has a good record playing with the Nuge, so things shouldn't change very much on that front, especially being the type of player Hall is where he'll collect points no matter which line he plays on."
EdmontonOilers,3bg2zb,notsoyoungpadawan,6,Mon Jun 29 01:16:38 2015 UTC,They should double shift CSP for both those lines. Nuge can centre everyone else. Why do we need more than 2 centres???
EdmontonOilers,3bg2zb,McEirhead,2,Mon Jun 29 04:22:22 2015 UTC,Those are some good points. Honestly I don't think either combination of lines would be all that bad. I feel/hope CSP would have very good chemistry as well
EdmontonOilers,3bg2zb,Muffy1234,1 point,Mon Jun 29 01:24:28 2015 UTC,"Neither combination will be bad, but I'm just looking at it from the perspective of optimal output."
EdmontonOilers,3bg2zb,notsoyoungpadawan,2,Mon Jun 29 01:30:23 2015 UTC,I've never seen much chemistry between Yak and RNH whereas regardless of if there's chemistry Yak will probably put away 25 goals just tipping in McDavid passes.
EdmontonOilers,3bg2zb,Loire55,2,Mon Jun 29 02:15:04 2015 UTC,"You forget though, that Hall will be on that line too. There could be conflict there, not because of any attitude issues, but because both Yak and Hall are goal scorers, and goal scorers like to score goals, not pass. So unless Hall isn't on that line, I'm having a tough time envisioning that line. Maybe break that line up further and play Hall on the third line with Lander? Dunno."
EdmontonOilers,3bg2zb,notsoyoungpadawan,4,Mon Jun 29 02:55:49 2015 UTC,You and I see this completely differently man. Yak is the natural fit for Hall and McDavid. He's a reflex and coordination guy which means when Hall and McDavid draw the defensive coverage off he's your man for a quick one timer or quick release wrister into the net from the other side of the ice.
EdmontonOilers,3bg2zb,Ferocian,3,Mon Jun 29 16:04:53 2015 UTC,"You gotta give Hall a better center than lander to work with (no disrespect to anton), McDavid may be our most marketable player but until he proves himself, Hall is still the best player we have and should be treated as such"
EdmontonOilers,3bg2zb,But-Seriously-Though,2,Mon Jun 29 21:08:19 2015 UTC,"I know, that's why I said maybe, but its starting to seem like we have to fit him into this team, rather than build around him."
EdmontonOilers,3bg2zb,notsoyoungpadawan,1 point,Mon Jun 29 21:34:36 2015 UTC,"Well hes a very hard player to build around, and thats not to call him selfish but more to say that his style of play is almost unique in a way, I cant really think of any players in the league I would compare it to."
EdmontonOilers,3bg2zb,But-Seriously-Though,1 point,Mon Jun 29 21:36:21 2015 UTC,"He is definitely one of the best players in the league, but if there was an offer on the table for him that included someone like Weber, I would take it. Its so much easier to replace wingers in this league, and we have a surplus of goalscorers in this team."
EdmontonOilers,3bg2zb,notsoyoungpadawan,1 point,Mon Jun 29 21:57:54 2015 UTC,"Only thing I trade Hall for is a big time undisputed, number one D-man (like Weber) but then again McDavid is probably the only one I wouldnt trade for a guy like that. But Hall has been forced to be the face of this franchise throughout the beginning of his career, I would find it difficult to discard him right at the beginning of what should be his prime years, now that he has a guy like McDavid to take more of the attention."
EdmontonOilers,3bg2zb,But-Seriously-Though,2,Mon Jun 29 22:08:18 2015 UTC,"I think Hall's reputation as a pure goal scorer has carried over from his junior days when he had to carry the bulk of the scoring for the Spitfires. He's become much more well-rounded offensively since he joined the league (53 assists in 13-14). I think he, Yak, and RNH would do just fine on a line together. The pure speed of the wings might even give Nuge a bit more space with the puck than he got with Ebs and Pouliot. At the end of the day though, any combination of those 6 will be brilliant and I can't wait for it!"
EdmontonOilers,3bg2zb,L_Beaud,3,Mon Jun 29 04:57:28 2015 UTC,"I honestly feel like Hall is more McDavid's style, but we'll see how that pans out. One thing I can tell you though is that Hall and Nuge don't work well together and that'd put Nuge as Hall's center and I don't see that working out."
EdmontonOilers,3bg2zb,Ferocian,8,Mon Jun 29 02:12:16 2015 UTC,One thing I can tell you though is that Hall and Nuge don't work well together   I find that an astonishing claim considering the fact that Hall put up 80 points playing next to Nuge.
EdmontonOilers,3bg2zb,notsoyoungpadawan,3,Mon Jun 29 02:52:03 2015 UTC,Their styles clash. Nuge likes to try to exploit a gap between the forwards and D where as Hall likes to try to get behind the D and crash. It doesn't work so well when your LW is trying to make something happen with speed and pressure whereas your center (and frankly RW) are more trying to make something happen with passing and shooting. McDavid on the other hand is also a speed/pressure style of player. I'd be surprised if he wasn't a better fit.
EdmontonOilers,3bg2zb,Ferocian,2,Mon Jun 29 15:43:48 2015 UTC,"Hall can create lots of points by himself, but there are those out there who think that hall isn't the easiest player to play with."
EdmontonOilers,3bg2zb,McEirhead,4,Mon Jun 29 04:25:46 2015 UTC,"Halls gotta be the fastest oiler, (maybe 2nd fastest after friday) but that combination of speed could be ala kariya selanne"
EdmontonOilers,3bg2zb,classyinthecorners,3,Mon Jun 29 04:30:49 2015 UTC,Sorta my thoughts as well.
EdmontonOilers,3bg2zb,Ferocian,3,Mon Jun 29 15:42:43 2015 UTC,"Now that you mention it, the Oilers desperately need a RH shot in the top 6 IMO. Hall, McD, RNH, Pou and Yak are all left handed - only Eberle the righty.    Heck Draisaitl and Lander are LH as well lol."
EdmontonOilers,3bg2zb,VanPerstrings,2,Mon Jun 29 04:28:21 2015 UTC,"I dont put alot of stock into who shoots which way, I heard a stat once that said when Detroit won one of their more recent stanley cups they only had 1 right handed shooter on the whole team, I don know if thats true or not but I do know that it just comes to a matter of whos comfortable playing where, I think Yak for example is more comfortable on his off wing."
EdmontonOilers,3bg2zb,But-Seriously-Though,1 point,Mon Jun 29 21:16:19 2015 UTC,Still think adding a RH threat is crucial on the PP. It creates a lot of space for one-timers with a RH shot on the left side.
EdmontonOilers,3bg2zb,VanPerstrings,5,Tue Jun 30 19:05:18 2015 UTC,"I haven't seen much of McDavid's play before, what really impressed me in that video wasn't the goals, it was the assists. His ability to see an opportunity and execute is impressive, but the level of hockey smarts required to see someone else's opportunity and execute is something else entirely. We're in for some good hockey."
EdmontonOilers,3bg5bi,tsn123456789,8,Sun Jun 28 22:50:33 2015 UTC,"You're right, the deadline is tomorrow, and as of right now there has been no announcements on any of our RFAs."
EdmontonOilers,3bg5bi,9Bains,4,Sun Jun 28 23:25:55 2015 UTC,I hope the management aren't too hung over from the post draft party and forget about this...
EdmontonOilers,3bg5bi,shweet44722,1 point,Mon Jun 29 00:32:01 2015 UTC,"Deadline to file for arbitration is the 5th as well. Certainly is an interesting, idk, tactic (?) that we either haven't heard anything or nothing's been done about the QO's.  Mind you, didn't a team submit like 6 QO's in one day? Maybe they've been working on them behind close curtains? I hope so at least."
EdmontonOilers,3bg5bi,Shottaz83,3,Mon Jun 29 03:35:30 2015 UTC,"Who do we need to qualify? Schultz, Pitlick and Davidson are all that I see. Fraser and Aulie are gone for sure."
EdmontonOilers,3bg5bi,McEirhead,1 point,Mon Jun 29 01:12:49 2015 UTC,I wouldn't be surprised if they cut ties with Pitlick.
EdmontonOilers,3bg5bi,VanPerstrings,-2,Mon Jun 29 01:32:35 2015 UTC,I hope Jultz isn't qualified.
EdmontonOilers,3bg5bi,VanPerstrings,11,Mon Jun 29 02:01:52 2015 UTC,"Well I dont see how letting him go to UFA is a good idea. Hes still an NHL level D and right handed, both of which we lack."
EdmontonOilers,3bg5bi,Colotech,1 point,Mon Jun 29 02:32:13 2015 UTC,"I would still like the Oilers to retain him, but if they lose him, I won't lose sleep over it. I just don't think he's worth what his qualifying offer may be.     At the same time it's tough because if he develops, he is exactly what the team needs. If Mike Green comes knocking to play here, It think that would be the end of Jultz Edmonton career."
EdmontonOilers,3bg5bi,paul-mccartney,4,Mon Jun 29 04:26:22 2015 UTC,"It's just terrible asset management to let a 24yo D man who's as talented as Schultz go for nothing. Even if you don't want him, sign him and use him as a trade chip, I guarantee you theres at least one team willing to give up assets for him. He's cheaper than Mike Green and has a lot more upside."
EdmontonOilers,3bg5bi,VanPerstrings,2,Mon Jun 29 04:55:26 2015 UTC,Agreed lets not give something away for nothing. Considering how weak we are still on D we should keep all the D we have and see how they all pan out during training camp. If we managed to sign him to a cheap 1-2 yr contract we could always flip him for a late draft pick.
EdmontonOilers,3bg5bi,ProfessorScribbles,6,Mon Jun 29 05:04:40 2015 UTC,"Why? Because he hasn't performed to expectations?  Putting a d-core together is a lot tougher than saying ""this guy hasn't performed to expectations, so fuck him.""  Schultz isn't the perfect d-man, but I don't see a ton of better options out there."
EdmontonOilers,3bg5bi,Eyo27,1 point,Mon Jun 29 02:56:00 2015 UTC,"Because he isn't worth his qualifying offer. Try to re-sign him at a lesser rate and if he doesn't want to, there will be some other defensemen available on the market."
EdmontonOilers,3bg5bi,A5hcrack,1 point,Mon Jun 29 04:24:30 2015 UTC,"Because IIRC we have to pay him at least $3.5 million per year to keep him due to RFA rules and Schultz is not even close to playing worth $3.5 million per year.    Signing him is basically committing one of our 6 D spots to being someone who can't play defense.  Maybe he learns, maybe he finally starts to play NHL defense. It's a pretty expensive gamble for a team that can't afford to have wasted slots."
EdmontonOilers,3bg5bi,haterbehatin,3,Mon Jun 29 05:59:54 2015 UTC,"3.5M for Schultz is high but not ridiculous if it's a short term deal. Ference makes 3, Nikitin makes 4.5. There's a ton of D who makes a lot more than 3.5 and worse than Schultz (Gardiner for instance). He was badly developed, not because he lacks the skill."
EdmontonOilers,3bg5bi,A5hcrack,5,Mon Jun 29 15:09:40 2015 UTC,"Give him a chance under a top nhl coach, and see what happens instead of giving up on him so fast."
EdmontonOilers,3bg5bi,A5hcrack,2,Mon Jun 29 05:38:17 2015 UTC,"I agree: I hope they offer him a contract that makes sense based on where he is in his development arc, and let him decide if this is where he wants to be, then take the rest of that money and put it toward getting players to push him down the depth chart. A third pair of Reinhart and Schultz wouldn't bother me in the least. A second pair including Schultz would definitely not put a smile on my face, and a top pair would infuriate me."
EdmontonOilers,3bg5bi,A5hcrack,1 point,Mon Jun 29 02:17:46 2015 UTC,"So Gryba is a healthy scratch then? Because I would be very happy with that.  A d core with no Ference , no Nikitin and no Gryba."
EdmontonOilers,3bg5bi,haterbehatin,2,Mon Jun 29 02:29:02 2015 UTC,"In my ideal world, one which I don't really expect to come true, we sign Franson to fit the top pair role beside Klefbom, who takes a big step up and actually deserves top pair minutes under competent coaching, as he did in the World Championships.   Darnell Nurse kicks the door in, taking the second pairing spot on the left side, and Fayne is beside him to cover for the kid defensively. I think athletically Nurse is ready, and I think if a kid can handle it physically, he's better off being coached by the best coaches the organization has, as long as he's going to get some minutes. If he's not going to play 20 minutes a game, he should be in the AHL. That's my opinion. But I think he's the most gifted athlete   The third pair is Reinhart and Schultz (under the above mentioned lower contract) Schultz gets to work on his game and gets dropped back to the second power play unit while he gets his game back together, that's the unit where I'd have Hall McDavid, and Yakupov, as my forwards. And I explain to Schultz that after two years of that; someone will probably give him 6-7 million per year when he's scoring 50-60 pts a year.   So yeah Gryba is the seventh D-man.   What I think is far more likely is that they sign nobody in free agency worth mentioning, Fayne plays top pair with Klefbom, Schultz plays second pair with Reinhart, and the third pair is Gryba with Ference. It's a much less pretty picture but I don't think Chia is going to bring in D-men just because ""they need to bring in someone"" that's the old way of doing things, and I'm hoping he changes that. That's what got us Nikitin at that ridiculous number, Ference at all, etc..."
EdmontonOilers,3bg5bi,A5hcrack,2,Mon Jun 29 04:09:08 2015 UTC,"In my ideal world, one which I don't really expect to come true, we sign Franson to fit the top pair role beside Klefbom, who takes a big step up and actually deserves top pair minutes under competent coaching, as he did in the World Championships.    Can you explain your logic of wanting Franson to play top pairing but yet wanting to shove Schultz out the door at the QO?"
EdmontonOilers,3bg5bi,haterbehatin,1 point,Mon Jun 29 15:23:30 2015 UTC,"Ok. Fanson isn't perfect Defensively, but he is a million miles beyond Schultz in that regard. He is a legitimate professional Defenseman. He also has a much harder shot and isn't completely useless in front of his own net. I would put Franson on par with Petry, and put him as the best available Free agent for this team right now due to age, and skill set. He's a good character guy who isn't afraid or incapable of doing things like blocking shots. He isn't going to cost the team games with his complete ineptitude in his own end.   I would not put Franson on the list of reasons that Toronto had a bad year, and I would Definitely put Schultz on the list of reasons that Edmonton did. I'm not against bringing Schultz back at a salary commensurate with his abilities, as the cupboard is bare in terms of prospects, and he may still develop, but the cycle of enabling players that show no improvement needs to end. Offensively I'd put them at about the same production level, though they play a different game. And Defensively one is capable, the other should probably just be put on a wing.   Ideally over the next year or two someone with better defensive acumen than Franson will be brought in to push him back to the second pair, but right now he's best available. In my opinion."
EdmontonOilers,3bg5bi,A5hcrack,1 point,Mon Jun 29 15:54:27 2015 UTC,"No offense but have you seen Franson play? Because everything you say is the complete opposite of what he actually is. He is nowhere near Petry defensively. The dude is a disaster without the puck. He can't skate. He's more physical than Schultz but that isn't saying much. You say Franson is a shot blocker, but Schultz had about the same block totals as Franson. Schultz is the far better puck mover compared to Franson. And why is Franson not on the list of reasons Leafs had a bad year? He was the top pairing D (and 2nd pairing last year) that allowed a historic amount of SOGA the last two years, he's absolutely one of the reasons for it. His 5on5 point generation the last 3 years is on par with Schultz despite the gong show this team has been. He's solid on the PP and has a great shot so I'll give you that.   I'm not against bringing Schultz back at a salary commensurate with his abilities, as the cupboard is bare in terms of prospects, and he may still develop, but the cycle of enabling players that show no improvement needs to end.    Would you bring Franson at a salary higher than his abilities? What would that salary be, because he's going to get 5-6M long term. As far as Schultz goes, I don't understand the logic of shoving the player under the bus when the organization has done a poor job of developing him. Everyone's an apologist for Yak under Eakins but Schultz who plays a much difficult position gets flamed for not developing fast enough. Ever think that maybe if we didn't have 4 coaches in his first 3 years and someone to actually mentor him (like Mitchell w/ Ekblad) that he might improve a little faster?"
EdmontonOilers,3bg5bi,notsoyoungpadawan,1 point,Mon Jun 29 16:26:21 2015 UTC,"First: skating is only key if you're playing a system where the defense are the ones carrying through the neutral zone, and based on every move they've made in this offseason I would speculate they're moving away from that. They're bringing in Trees who can pass on the back end. Schultz doesn't look like a fit because outlet passing is about the worst part of his game. Franson does. Objectively would Franson be better if his skating was better? Well yeah, but it's looking like they're devaluing that going forward.   Secondly you can't give Schultz a pass for bad team and shaky coaching and then not do the same for Franson. And Franson's time on the top pair in Toronto was exclusively with Pfaneuf playing on the left side, where he sucks, with their top line of chumps who cant or won't play defense in front of him the vast majority of the time. Pfaneuf is suspect when he's comfortable, on the left side he's an epic turnstile. Is Franson a shut down defender? No. Nobody would say that but if you think Petry was I've got nothing further to say. Petry knew where to stand, and had a great view of many goals while he did nothing but stand in the right place. The 2-0 goal of game six against the Lightning was perfect Petry. Right there, not playing the puck or the man while the puck is put in the back of the net. Me putting Franson on par with Petry is saying he's below average in the defensive zone but not terrible. But I'll take the physical guy who doesn't know where to stand over the finesse guy who won't do anything when he gets there.   and yeah, I'd rather overpay for a top four defender than a bottom pair defender. And I would say it's not even questionable that Franson is worth more than Schultz, if the price was 5 per and the term 5 years I wouldn't even blink. The Petry deal? Can't say I'd love it but I'd understand where they were coming from in doing it. there are no bargians to be had in free agency. Other than trading a key piece overspending in Free agency is the only way that hole is getting plugged. I'll take the physical guy with the rocket off the point over the finesse turnover machine. And I'll happily pay more to do so."

EdmontonOilers,3bexr2,ribozyme90,-15,Mon Jun 29 03:26:06 2015 UTC,That fantastic beauty is going to really make the potholes that riddle all the streets around it stand out. City council could repave the roads too but they put all their money into the building.  Edit: you fellas are cute thinking downvotes mean anything to anybody.
EdmontonOilers,3bexr2,Loire55,7,Sun Jun 28 16:52:30 2015 UTC,The arena was largely paid for with the CRL and arena user fees with very little public money being used. The arena district will increase revenue for the city for decades to come. Potholes are a completely separate part of the budget. With the oldest and shittiest arena in the league and without a new arena the Oilers would have risked being relocated. I don't see how any Oiler fan could be against the new arena unless they are sorely misinformed.  Here's the actual financing information
EdmontonOilers,3bexr2,johnedeadly,9,Sun Jun 28 18:05:04 2015 UTC,"Uninformed people always stand against change. The people that complain about the new arena have never been downtown except to pass through. They don't see the kind of change revitalizing Jasper ave has  caused. They don't read how the downtown airport was hindering development. They don't look into the economic benefit of the buildings going up in the arena district. They think because Rexall hasn't caved in on itself that the Oilers have a ""perfectly fine place to play"".  The arena is going forward regardless, there's no point in arguing with them about it, and when despite all their worldly knowledge and experience, the former wasteland that was downtown Edmonton is better for it, they will reap the benefits unironically."

EdmontonOilers,3bexr2,jessetherrien,1 point,Mon Jun 29 02:06:54 2015 UTC,I never see any potholes on the south end of gateway or Calgary trail and CT has that black asphalt. Whatever it is we should be using it around the rest of the city because it it awesome.
EdmontonOilers,3bexr2,Loire55,1 point,Sun Jun 28 20:16:32 2015 UTC,The problem isn't the cap (asphalt) but that the city didn't even design the older roads to handle big trucks because it's cheaper to do so. So it's what's underneath the cap that's the problem.   Edit: and I believe that end you are talking about is done by the province and they seem to design and build the roads properly.
EdmontonOilers,3bexr2,anotheronedown,3,Sun Jun 28 22:28:24 2015 UTC,The city of Edmonton is underlain by clay deposited by a glacial lake way back when. The clay is terrible for the freeze frost cycle. The reason we get so many more potholes in the older parts of town despite them being repaved every 5 or so years is because the old roads aren't built up like in the modern area's. They just tear out the old cement and repave in the same way.  It's like how old areas have low hanging overhead power lines. It's the way they were originally built and the city deems it to difficult or too expensive to rectify the issue.
EdmontonOilers,3bexr2,jessetherrien,2,Mon Jun 29 00:34:25 2015 UTC,It could be the province but it starts right around south common so it's still in the city.
EdmontonOilers,3bexr2,johnedeadly,2,Sun Jun 28 22:37:48 2015 UTC,"Yes, but the city has no say in how it's built or when. Like the Henday."
EdmontonOilers,3bexr2,goilers97,-5,Sun Jun 28 22:48:45 2015 UTC,"I never said I was against it, I said the potholes are going to be more visible against the backdrop of a shiny new multimillion dollar building."

EdmontonOilers,3bezud,tsn123456789,2,Sun Jun 28 17:19:03 2015 UTC,"Yes and no. Only $925k comes off the books if he goes to the AHL,leaving about $3.5M on the cap. This may or may not be a problem for the Oilers, depending on what else happens in free agency.  So a buyout would have less impact on the cap, but it would spread it out over two years."
EdmontonOilers,3bezud,fudgeyouman,5,Sun Jun 28 17:54:18 2015 UTC,"I'd rather bite the bullet one year. 1M is still a decent amount of cap relief, even a buyout will cost us 1.5M of cap so we're only gaining 3M of cap space this year vs 1M and lose 1.5M of cap next year. We'll be under the cap this year anyways so it won't hurt us too much. At this point I don't think any team is willing to take him unless we give up assets."

EdmontonOilers,3bezud,A5hcrack,1 point,Sun Jun 28 23:29:47 2015 UTC,"Even if they retained half his salary and got nothing back but future considerations from a team looking to hit the cap floor, it would be a better move than a buyout. They don't really need the cap space after this weekends moves, at least not immediately, and stretching out Nikitin's cap hit in to a year where some key young pieces (Talbot, Klefbom) are getting deals, limits options too much.   Based on the moves they've made I'm guessing the D-men are not going to be playing the same role they were last year. It's also possible they think Nikitin will thrive in the new system and we don't really know how bad his back was all year. Back injuries tend to linger until they get extended care."
EdmontonOilers,3bezud,Eyo27,1 point,Mon Jun 29 02:34:11 2015 UTC,"Just wait it out, its only one more year or try and move him at the trade deadline."
EdmontonOilers,3beyyh,Eyo27,11,Sun Jun 28 16:51:30 2015 UTC,Burns would cost more than the Oilers are willing to pay.
EdmontonOilers,3beyyh,falsekoala,3,Sun Jun 28 17:13:25 2015 UTC,That's basically it.  He'll be available in a year when we're looking to compete.  Get him on the draft floor next year for picks and prospects.
EdmontonOilers,3beyyh,Dr_Marxist,5,Mon Jun 29 04:29:32 2015 UTC,"I'd maybe give up a pick or two next year, but not too much. Burns would be perfect on this team to replace Schultz, but he's also a UFA next year so we need to be careful not to over pay."
EdmontonOilers,3beyyh,0ILERS,4,Sun Jun 28 17:09:14 2015 UTC,He has two more years left on his deal. Sharks are not moving Burns for picks.
EdmontonOilers,3beyyh,tsn123456789,2,Sun Jun 28 17:22:06 2015 UTC,"Oh you're right. Somehow I was thinking he was UFA next year. Yeah not sure what we could give up for him then. Not sure if Burns is worth working out a deal for Yakupov, as Yak will still be RFA once his deal is up."
EdmontonOilers,3beyyh,0ILERS,2,Sun Jun 28 17:26:52 2015 UTC,"Hard to imagine Sharks letting go of Burns after he just had his best ever season. The price would be too steep, and I can't see us letting go of high end draft picks again in next year's draft, which is also supposed to be a very deep draft."
EdmontonOilers,3beyyh,notsoyoungpadawan,2,Sun Jun 28 17:25:31 2015 UTC,"I really like Burnsy, but we'd have to give up too much to get him. It just isn't worth it right now."
EdmontonOilers,3beyyh,Shottaz83,1 point,Sun Jun 28 21:23:45 2015 UTC,"I expect the Sharks to re-sign him to a long term contract.  To get him would cost one of our core, and don't think people will be willing to give up that."
EdmontonOilers,3beyyh,oilernut,1 point,Sun Jun 28 17:38:21 2015 UTC,I'd give up a lot for him. But the Sharks have literally no reason to give him up.
EdmontonOilers,3beyyh,bigfatphony,1 point,Sun Jun 28 22:13:30 2015 UTC,"There's no way they'd deal him. But that's not what you asked. I suspect that Chia could make a call. That's his job to find out if the guy that fills a pretty big need is available. I would guess that he called everyone that had a guy like that and didn't like the answers or we'd already have a guy. From his availabilities I would guess that the deals that have been done are the ones that are getting done unless someone calls him with something. I would guess he'll still be hunting defenseman in free agency, but I'm thinking that the trades are pretty much done.   As for what I'd give up: I wouldn't be willing to weaken the roster three years from now to bring him over, the young Core needs to be built around, not replaced with older guys. This isn't a team on the cusp of a cup run, hell even a playoff spot would still be a long shot next year. I like Burns but he's not Pronger. So basically not McDavid, Draisaitl, Nugent-Hopkins, Lander, Pouliot, Hall, Eberle, Yakupov, Klefbom, Nurse, Reinhart,  or Talbot. The rest of the roster is replaceable. Picks don't matter all that much next year, they'd be up for grabs, I'm not overly fond of the vast majority of the prospects in the system, at least not fond enough I wouldn't trade them for Burns."
EdmontonOilers,3beyyh,A5hcrack,0,Mon Jun 29 03:04:58 2015 UTC,"No.  Burns didn't want to play defense on the Sharks; McLellan knew he was better as a power forward but Wilson, refusing to make moves to replace Boyle and help Vlasic, forced Todd to move him back to D.  As it stands I don't think we need another power forward on that kind of contract."
EdmontonOilers,3beyyh,ProfessorScribbles,3,Sun Jun 28 18:37:00 2015 UTC,Is that why he played D on Team Canada or could Canada not find D men to replace him?
EdmontonOilers,3beyyh,ProfessorScribbles,1 point,Mon Jun 29 00:11:47 2015 UTC,"He's capable of being a good offensive defenseman, but he shines as a forward.  I just think people expect him to he a saviour for our D when he's really not much more defensively capable than Schultz."
EdmontonOilers,3beyyh,awful_astronaut,1 point,Mon Jun 29 02:11:39 2015 UTC,He is plenty defensively capable again as seen on team Canada (since I don't watch the Sharks) he was trusted with a lot of minutes playing top pair. I have no question he is a top pairing guy on a lot of teams.
EdmontonOilers,3beyyh,silverlegend,1 point,Mon Jun 29 17:20:23 2015 UTC,"As far as offensive defensemen go, Burns tied for second in points with Subban last season, had more shots and was more physical.  He is a serviceable forward, but his real value is defense, in my opinion."
EdmontonOilers,3beyyh,Icekommander,-1,Tue Jun 30 19:09:29 2015 UTC,"A conditional deal upon him signing an extension. Maybe a 3rd round pick + prospect that becomes a 2nd round pick + better prospect if he signs an extension.   Edit: Upon further investigation, I see that Burns is NOT a UFA after this season. So yeah. This isn't going to get him in an Oilers jersey."
EdmontonOilers,3beyyh,silverlegend,4,Sun Jun 28 17:13:26 2015 UTC,"Sharks would never do that, unless the prospect is somebody like Draisaitl. But a third and Platzer for Burns will never happen."
EdmontonOilers,3bevyp,notsoyoungpadawan,25,Sun Jun 28 16:23:09 2015 UTC,"No. We really don't need a centre at this point in time. If we did, we would have re-signed Roy, given that he already had chemistry with the team."
EdmontonOilers,3bevyp,gwaksl,11,Sun Jun 28 16:34:58 2015 UTC,"No, if we wanted a guy like that just sign Roy for a lot cheaper, and he already has good chemistry with Yak."
EdmontonOilers,3bevyp,Eyo27,2,Sun Jun 28 16:40:40 2015 UTC,Difference being Richards is a SC winning captain and is much more defensively disciplined than Roy.
EdmontonOilers,3bevyp,HarfNarfArf,6,Sun Jun 28 17:27:20 2015 UTC,Technically he is not an SC captain. But he is (was at one point) a great leader. He just hasn't been the same since that one hit a few seasons back.
EdmontonOilers,3bevyp,RightOnEh,1 point,Sun Jun 28 20:33:59 2015 UTC,Dustin Brown is/was the captain
EdmontonOilers,3bevyp,Moosecavalry,2,Mon Jun 29 04:00:27 2015 UTC,You're right. Not sure why I confused the two.
EdmontonOilers,3bevyp,areyouhappynowethan,3,Mon Jun 29 04:02:10 2015 UTC,No chance
EdmontonOilers,3bevyp,fudgeyouman,3,Sun Jun 28 18:12:04 2015 UTC,"No, he's finished"
EdmontonOilers,3bevyp,tsn123456789,3,Sun Jun 28 16:34:12 2015 UTC,No.
EdmontonOilers,3bevyp,edmonton3,3,Sun Jun 28 16:34:40 2015 UTC,1) If we can unload Purcell  and  2) If hes super cheap  The difference between him and Roy is that Roy can't play wing or defense. Richards can move from 1st to 4th line (he did that last year). His point production and adv stats sucked ass because he was stuck on the 4th line most of the year. For say 1M he's a low risk high reward kind of guy like Ribeiro was for NSH last year
EdmontonOilers,3bevyp,DadWizard,2,Sun Jun 28 16:48:52 2015 UTC,Do we really need him?
EdmontonOilers,3bevyp,McEirhead,2,Sun Jun 28 16:28:56 2015 UTC,If we can move Purcell and/ or Nikitin and he's extremely inexpensive I don't think I would be against it. Either he turns it around and provides depth and insulation for our young guys or he is not great and gets sent down or walks in a year. No harm there
EdmontonOilers,3bevyp,B0mb-Hands,1 point,Sun Jun 28 20:40:33 2015 UTC,"Naaaa... Small centre, who's last 3 years with LA hasn't been very positive, all the while his production has been trending down. Pass"

EdmontonOilers,3bevyp,LunarLion,1 point,Sun Jun 28 17:40:03 2015 UTC,"No, this city has had enough of washed up formerly good players coming to town.   Besides, who the hell wants another center."

EdmontonOilers,3bevyp,Main_man_mike,1 point,Sun Jun 28 18:48:28 2015 UTC,Personally I don't think he is the right fit for the team. There isn't enough of a strong character presence in the oilers locker room to be able to handle a personality such as his. I think if we could unload Purcell that Patrick Sharp would be a much better fit and would still leave them well under he cap.
EdmontonOilers,3bevyp,speedonthis,1 point,Sun Jun 28 19:03:59 2015 UTC,We've got plenty of centers already and while there's no such problem as having too many what we really need is a top line RHD.
EdmontonOilers,3bevyp,DeuceBuggalo,1 point,Sun Jun 28 20:31:33 2015 UTC,I think we're all good for centers at the moment.
EdmontonOilers,3bevyp,stelts94,1 point,Sun Jun 28 20:51:58 2015 UTC,"He's one of my favourite players but I don't think we need him at this point. Lander is cheaper, Commissioner's still here, Nuge and McD with LD waiting in the wings."
EdmontonOilers,3bevyp,VanPerstrings,1 point,Mon Jun 29 01:49:44 2015 UTC,"I love the Kenora Kid, one of my favourite players! I legitimately think he has some gas left in the tank.

EdmontonOilers,3bda73,TheBlackLight,12,Sun Jun 28 06:58:51 2015 UTC,Sounds to me like you need a Ference/Nikitin/maybe Schultz flair.
EdmontonOilers,3bda73,HarfNarfArf,2,Sun Jun 28 10:11:59 2015 UTC,"Maybe if we add flair for other teams' stud d men, he can use that and we'll end up with a Keith or a Subban."

EdmontonOilers,3bdmtr,tsn123456789,11,Sun Jun 28 05:44:08 2015 UTC,Kid's got a great hockey name
EdmontonOilers,3bdmtr,B0mb-Hands,7,Sun Jun 28 07:50:41 2015 UTC,With a name like that you'd think Boston would've picked him.
EdmontonOilers,3bdmtr,Allamure,3,Sun Jun 28 08:23:55 2015 UTC,Nah he was ranked way too high
EdmontonOilers,3bdmtr,Shottaz83,8,Sun Jun 28 19:00:43 2015 UTC,"This pick is looking like a steal for us. He looks really good, and isn't afraid to shoot the puck. He has an absolute Bomb from the point as well!"
EdmontonOilers,3bdmtr,Loire55,8,Sun Jun 28 06:57:48 2015 UTC,"Yeah he's really young too. June 26, 1997 so he just turned 18 over the weekend"
EdmontonOilers,3bdmtr,highflyer83,3,Sun Jun 28 07:09:07 2015 UTC,Kid's got good footwork and an incredible release. Now I just need to see sime highlights on the other side of the puck.
EdmontonOilers,3bcseg,notsoyoungpadawan,9,Sun Jun 28 00:12:31 2015 UTC,"Nice to see Talbot and Gryba are excited to come here. I have high hopes for Cam. He's been training and learning from one of the best goalies in the league, and thats a huge deal. Hopefully he comes into camp, plays great in the pre-season and just takes the reigns. I wan't to see him run with it."

EdmontonOilers,3bb3a6,jimmeh44,9,Sat Jun 27 14:55:36 2015 UTC,Rangers must have seen all the teams getting the goalies they want and lowered their asking price
EdmontonOilers,3bb3a6,WobblyHobbly,20,Sat Jun 27 14:59:48 2015 UTC,Great deal considering they turned down 2 seconds at the start of the draft
EdmontonOilers,3bb3a6,Jeffw54,4,Sat Jun 27 14:58:49 2015 UTC,Apparently they turned down a first as well
EdmontonOilers,3bb3a6,IGetComputersPuting,3,Sat Jun 27 15:38:32 2015 UTC,Didn't know what year that first was. No one reported if it was this year or next.
EdmontonOilers,3bb3a6,irishguy42,37,Sat Jun 27 16:02:05 2015 UTC,I wonder if Chiarelli got all the scouting reports and they were so bad he just decides fuck it I'm going to trade all the picks and fire everyone.

EdmontonOilers,3bb3a6,notsoyoungpadawan,5,Sat Jun 27 14:53:55 2015 UTC,I'd like to keep Marincin if possible. He's looked better and better each time he's been up.
EdmontonOilers,3bb3a6,MrSlipp,3,Sat Jun 27 15:07:03 2015 UTC,"He has, but at this point he's our weakest LHD, so it kind of makes sense to trade him for a piece that fits better.

EdmontonOilers,3bb3a6,Imonahorsebigguy,2,Sat Jun 27 15:01:27 2015 UTC,Does Reinhart play the right side? He shoots left.
EdmontonOilers,3bb3a6,Anonymau5_,2,Sat Jun 27 15:20:49 2015 UTC,He played there in Bridgeport last season for 20 games. His last 18 games he was showing well I guess. Not sure when he played his right side stretch though.
EdmontonOilers,3bb3a6,chopsjohnson,12,Sat Jun 27 15:46:28 2015 UTC,"I feel like if it was MacT making all these moves there would be mass outrage. Lack goes for a 3rd and a 7th. The Oilers spend a 2nd, 3rd and 7th. Flames get Hamilton, a legit top 4 RHD, we get Griffin Reinhart. Deepest draft in years, and we trade a bunch of picks.  I'm not saying I don't like the moves, because I do (would've preferred a more proven goalie maybe). But I know for sure Chia is getting way more rope here with Oil country than MacT would've."
EdmontonOilers,3bb3a6,bigfatphony,7,Sat Jun 27 15:14:51 2015 UTC,"Deep draft but a lot of that is media hype too due to McEichel. After 40 (well 60ish due to Boston making weird picks) I think the talent starts to tail off anyways. Also given the position of the picks we gave up it's more like a 3rd, 3rd-4th, and 7th. Chances of you getting a NHL player at those positions are rather low (like under 1 in 10 or something)  I agree that MacT gets a ton of unnecessary hate here due to our team record, individually most of his moves were pretty good, but fans tend to judge management based on win totals alone."
EdmontonOilers,3bb3a6,tsn123456789,3,Sat Jun 27 15:20:59 2015 UTC,"Vancouver was never sending him to Edmonton and hes not that good, Talbot has some upside."
EdmontonOilers,3bb3a6,koho_66,2,Sun Jun 28 06:24:58 2015 UTC,You do know that last time when we wanted a goalie from Vancouver they wanted us to pay an arm and a leg ? There's no way the Canucks were trading Lack to us for so little. You don't strengthen a division rival for peanuts.
EdmontonOilers,3bb3a6,Frostdavid,1 point,Sat Jun 27 17:02:11 2015 UTC,"It's not really about Lack vs. Talbot. It's about the optics of trading for an unknown, and not just that, but trading for an unknown that is basically exactly the same in results as another unknown, but paying more for him.  Those kind of excuses of, ""oh well, it was a division rival"" or ""they didn't want to take our offer, even though it was better"" are the kind of excuses MacTavish wouldn't have gotten the benefit of."
EdmontonOilers,3bb3a6,bigfatphony,0,Sun Jun 28 00:37:19 2015 UTC,Eventually we have to stop rebuilding and start winning.
EdmontonOilers,3bb3a6,Main_man_mike,3,Sun Jun 28 00:20:02 2015 UTC,"Griffin Reinhart is a win now move? Talbot has never been a true #1, that's a win now move?  Seems to me these are moves with some question marks, and both these players will have some growing to do to. I'm not saying they won't grow, and they won't be successful, because I think they will. But the fact is, other teams got established players and we did not. If MacTavish had made those moves, he'd have been tarred and feathered. But because it's Chia, it's, ""ya! The Oilers are finally trying to win now!""  I just find that kind of funny."

If anything Ference should be bought out, Nikitin should be moved for nothing (Hello Coyotes) and Purcell should be allowed to play out his year with us. His contract is the least bad of the crop."
EdmontonOilers,3bb3a6,Loire55,0,Sat Jun 27 16:05:46 2015 UTC,Ference has two years left. Nikitin 1.
EdmontonOilers,3bb3a6,Gump_Worsley,2,Sat Jun 27 21:16:10 2015 UTC,I meant another year after this one.
EdmontonOilers,3bb3a6,Loire55,1 point,Sat Jun 27 21:21:07 2015 UTC,"I would be down with that. Nikitin needs to go, I don't want to see him on this team this season."
EdmontonOilers,3bb3a6,Gump_Worsley,1 point,Sat Jun 27 23:29:15 2015 UTC,I don't think he'll play but it might be better to keep his contract unless we badly need the money. One season and we're done with him or multiple seasons we're dealing with a portion of his contract.
EdmontonOilers,3bb3a6,Loire55,1 point,Sat Jun 27 23:43:58 2015 UTC,never happen in the cap era

EdmontonOilers,3bb3a6,Eyo27,4,Sun Jun 28 06:21:54 2015 UTC,Kylington's still on the board really hoped we took him with 57
EdmontonOilers,3bb3a6,tsn123456789,6,Sat Jun 27 15:12:41 2015 UTC,Kylington just got picked up by the Flames. Fuck. So that's a thing.
EdmontonOilers,3bb3a6,speedonthis,4,Sat Jun 27 14:56:20 2015 UTC,At this point their defence is just impossibly good. Them picking up Kylington didn't even sting after Hamilton.
EdmontonOilers,3bb3a6,Loire55,2,Sat Jun 27 14:57:38 2015 UTC,"Good point, good point."
EdmontonOilers,3bb3a6,speedonthis,4,Sat Jun 27 15:35:40 2015 UTC,This is great. Significantly lower than the asking price. I'm sure he and Scrivens can hold down the fort next year.
EdmontonOilers,3bb3a6,Arunatic5,3,Sat Jun 27 16:08:42 2015 UTC,Not gonna lie if we could somehow sneak in and snag Kylington I would be so stoked

EdmontonOilers,3bb3a6,blakehall,2,Sat Jun 27 15:02:57 2015 UTC,"Between this and the Hagelin deal, whatever was in the water in Boston yesterday seems to have gotten to New York today.  I was worried about an overpayment for Talbot given his contract status, but the way the Oilers have failed to pick decent players in this range of the draft this feels like a win to me."
EdmontonOilers,3bb3a6,tsn123456789,1 point,Sat Jun 27 15:58:33 2015 UTC,"Hagelin is an RFA, he was asking for too much  The third and whatever the last picks are is basically worthless. Talbot absolutely goes in before the late 2nd round if he enters this draft so this is a good deal."
EdmontonOilers,3bb3a6,jordanrhys,2,Sat Jun 27 14:59:10 2015 UTC,I hope Talbot keeps his mask. That thing will become a legendary oiler mask.

EdmontonOilers,3bb3a6,envague,1 point,Sat Jun 27 15:56:38 2015 UTC,I am fine with this. More than overpaying with draft picks in a trade I was worried we would resort to overspending for a goalie in the UFA market.

We get a current roster player in our most needed spot in exchange.   Great move by the management to leverage the amount of goalies that were available to either get a good deal or shrug it off and get someone else."

Definitely wouldn't expect him to be our saving grace"

EdmontonOilers,3bbb5i,ipooblood,9,Sat Jun 27 16:13:20 2015 UTC,I knew the Marincin trade was part of something bigger.
EdmontonOilers,3bbb5i,TheAngryBartender,25,Sat Jun 27 16:25:01 2015 UTC,"Ottawa: ""We want a fourth round pick for Gryba.""  Edmonton: ""Shit. We don't have any more... let's get one from Toronto.""

EdmontonOilers,3bbb5i,Andy-Martin,12,Sat Jun 27 18:42:05 2015 UTC,"so basically Marincin and Ewanyk for Gryba, which is a lot better"
EdmontonOilers,3bbb5i,tsn123456789,16,Sat Jun 27 16:08:42 2015 UTC,"Neither marincin nor ewanyk were playing for us next season, Gryba is RHD and a big defensive d man. He's better than Nikitin and 3 million cheaper"
EdmontonOilers,3bbb5i,ipooblood,-3,Sat Jun 27 16:14:56 2015 UTC,Than Marty? No its not. Gryba is a 3rd pairing dman at best. Marincin is much better with the puck. We downgraded from him to get a RHD instead of a LHD
EdmontonOilers,3bbb5i,callmenighthawk,8,Sat Jun 27 16:14:40 2015 UTC,I mean a lot better than a 4th rounder and a goon
EdmontonOilers,3bbb5i,tsn123456789,2,Sat Jun 27 16:15:52 2015 UTC,Ah. Yes true that. Just disappointed in essentially moving Marty for him. Should've gone for a better target if we were gone move Marincin.
EdmontonOilers,3bbb5i,callmenighthawk,2,Sat Jun 27 16:28:18 2015 UTC,"Yeah I thought Marincin had far more value, even a future 3rd or something is better than a 4th or even add a later pick for a future 2nd. Gryba is a 6/7 guy so at best we wash on this deal (if Marincin doesn't improve at all). Bad asset management if you ask me."
EdmontonOilers,3bbb5i,tsn123456789,8,Sat Jun 27 16:29:34 2015 UTC,"The only people high on Marty were us fans. Literally everwhere hes played, his coach has said he has problems with compete. We have enough coasting as is."

EdmontonOilers,3bbb5i,ksieben,1 point,Sat Jun 27 16:30:43 2015 UTC,I agree.  I was hoping we'd land Lucic just so that we'd have someone that can drop the gloves if someone tries to run one of our young guys.  Gryba can do that though too.
EdmontonOilers,3bbb5i,darkstar107,3,Sat Jun 27 20:31:12 2015 UTC,More trades to come I'd have to think.  Ewanyk and Marincin for Gryba isn't a great trade but Marty probably wanted out after last season.  I'm not too jaded about this now that I know we had more in store besides just contract/pick trades.  I'd REALLY like if we actually made a few picks this draft. Just to not totally empty the cabinet for this age group of draftees.
EdmontonOilers,3bbb5i,ProfessorScribbles,3,Sat Jun 27 16:18:45 2015 UTC,"Mark Fraser, Keith Aulie, Eric Gryba. I really hope one of these things is not like the other."
EdmontonOilers,3bbb5i,DeuceBuggalo,6,Sat Jun 27 18:34:17 2015 UTC,Wut? Gryba is a 3rd pairing RHD at best.
EdmontonOilers,3bbb5i,notsoyoungpadawan,12,Sat Jun 27 16:08:47 2015 UTC,Which means we can buyout Nikitin and his stupid contract
EdmontonOilers,3bbb5i,B0mb-Hands,3,Sat Jun 27 16:17:02 2015 UTC,Or eat it. I would rather just eat it and bench his ass while we have the cap instead of having to have that extra mil a year linger.
EdmontonOilers,3bbb5i,learn2die101,2,Sat Jun 27 17:18:48 2015 UTC,Yeah I'd rather have a useless veteran sit up in a press box than one of our prospects who would be missing out on valuable playtime down on the farm.

EdmontonOilers,3bbb5i,ksieben,9,Sat Jun 27 16:41:11 2015 UTC,Ference on the 2nd pairing with Schultz... you high?
EdmontonOilers,3bbb5i,Interwebzking,3,Sat Jun 27 16:49:47 2015 UTC,No kidding! That would be like -1 every two shifts
EdmontonOilers,3bbb5i,mauriceh,5,Sat Jun 27 17:25:03 2015 UTC,I'd have old Ference there on the bottom and then have Nurse or Reinhart play with Schultz
EdmontonOilers,3bbb5i,Interwebzking,2,Sat Jun 27 17:33:19 2015 UTC,"I don't think the order really matters right now, does it?"

EdmontonOilers,3bbb5i,Interwebzking,1 point,Sat Jun 27 17:03:47 2015 UTC,"I have a feeling Chia is going to overhaul that 2nd line. Might get rid of all Niktin, Ference, Schultz and might trade for a RHD and sign a LHD like Paul Martin or Ehrhoff on free. Even if that second line looks like Martin - Franson, we'll be in an infinitely better position going into next season."
EdmontonOilers,3bbb5i,notsoyoungpadawan,2,Sat Jun 27 21:48:36 2015 UTC,Hmm I like the way you think son.

As a long standing club legend there's absolutely no doubt that CuJo loved his time in Edmonton, so I like to imagine that after we won the lottery he related to CSP and his family that he's going to love playing here."

His numbers in New York is comparable to Lundqvist so we have that going for us. He actually had a pretty bad stretch this year but had a lot of shutouts which helped his overall numbers. Right now he probably splits with Scrivens."
EdmontonOilers,3bbnce,McEirhead,6,Sat Jun 27 18:05:17 2015 UTC,"I'd be betting that Talbot starts between 50-60 games this year. His numbers and advanced stats have generally been better than scrivens...

EdmontonOilers,3bbnce,tsn123456789,5,Sat Jun 27 19:06:26 2015 UTC,True true. I do think scrivens could still be an NHL starter in front of a better D. I do have some questions about his wherewithal now though.

EdmontonOilers,3bbnce,Ferocian,12,Sat Jun 27 18:13:39 2015 UTC,Whats a..playoff series? Is that that weird thing where you play hockey in June? Sounds interesting.

EdmontonOilers,3bbnce,Goregutz,5,Sat Jun 27 20:44:09 2015 UTC,"The talbot trade was the best move we made at the draft, best move since Chia took over. He waited until the price was favorable for us then pulled the trigger. Honestly we paid more for Reinhart and we needed a goalie more. Not to mention Talbot is the safer bet on being a contributing roster player, there's still some element of gamble for Reinhart. Excellent move."
EdmontonOilers,3bbnce,Boxerboy02,6,Sun Jun 28 04:13:13 2015 UTC,Are you sure drafting Connor Mcdavid wasn't the best move?
EdmontonOilers,3bbnce,Loire55,3,Sun Jun 28 05:25:03 2015 UTC,It didn't take more than a forrest gump esque iq to figure out to do that.
EdmontonOilers,3bbnce,ProfessorScribbles,3,Sun Jun 28 17:39:35 2015 UTC,"I forgot about how moves were ""do something"" not organize a really good trade or situation. Simply acting upon a first pick that any team would of done, give the same pretense, is a ""move"" apparently?"
EdmontonOilers,3bbnce,TweetsInCommentsBot,9,Mon Jun 29 09:27:55 2015 UTC,"Small sample size, but the numbers are such that bare minimum he's league average.  He could be a real home run, standard goalies are voodoo caveat though.  Idk how he'll be behind our current defense.  He's a smart bet."
EdmontonOilers,3bbnce,Loire55,6,Sat Jun 27 18:00:08 2015 UTC,His sample size wasn't too bad. Fifty-seven games across two seasons isn't great but it's no flash in the pan.

EdmontonOilers,3bbnce,vanillaacid,11,Sat Jun 27 18:13:01 2015 UTC,"Partly because they were running out of chances to trade him, partly because he wanted to be a starter right now, partly because Sather's a bro."

EdmontonOilers,3bbnce,9Bains,5,Sat Jun 27 18:22:24 2015 UTC,Fucking Sather just didn't want to admit the Lack trade and the passing of the second round forced his hand.  Still love the old Codger.
EdmontonOilers,3bbnce,Spoonfeedme,4,Sat Jun 27 21:47:07 2015 UTC,"Talbot is up for a raise at the end of this year, might as well work on a new backup now that the King is healthy again."
EdmontonOilers,3bbnce,El_reverso,3,Sat Jun 27 18:21:10 2015 UTC,"Trade hm while he still has value. He had a great season where he filled in for Hank when he was injured. If they keep him for another season, he won't get many games to drive his value higher (assuming good health for Hank) so he may drop off people's radar. Not to mention a bad streak or injury will drive his value way down.   A case of getting what you can, while you can. Just turned out for NYR the return wasn't as much as the wanted."
EdmontonOilers,3bbnce,Spoonfeedme,2,Sat Jun 27 20:21:03 2015 UTC,"He's a backup. Yes he stepped up when Lundqvist was injured, but then again the Oilers already have 2 goalies who were backups, stepped up big when their respective team's starter went down with injury.  My concern is that Edmonton still hasn't addressed a need for a legitimate starter. Scrivens, Fssth and Talbot I don't think can start 60+ games a season for the Oilers. They aren't pressure goalies if you ask me.   New York had a great defines that limited and blocked a lot of shots. In 57 career games Talbot has faced 1600 shots. In his 78 games for the Oilers Scrivens has faced 2283 shots and Fasth in 32 games has faced 690. The Oilers give up a lot of shots and they haven't improved defensively enough to expect their goaltenders next season won't have to see 2100+ pucks come their way.  It's a lot to expect from a guy who has as little experience as Talbot does."
EdmontonOilers,3bbnce,TheRealKozi,3,Sun Jun 28 04:34:16 2015 UTC,"Your numbers kinda skew the facts I think, so I'm gonna try and flush them out a bit.   Talbot faced an average 28.07 shots per game, there as Fasth, according to your numbers, faced 21.56 shots per game, and Scrivens faces 29.27 shots per game. I'm not sure why Fasth faced so few shots a night, maybe getting yelled at that one game straightened out the D a bit, but either way I'll ignore it because of sample size and because it is such an outlier.  Scrivens faces the most shots per game, but the difference is 1.2 shots a game, the difference of 6 shots every 5 games. That isn't a lot. Another concern the defense, and though it may be the worst in the league, Talbot is one of the better goalies at saving higher risk shots according to this blog. Now there are no numbers to support this, but if it is to be believed our porous defense could be aided by Cam Talbot.   As far as his career games goes, yes they are low, but everyone starts at zero and goes up from there. Give him time and see what we actually have. Before Bishop was traded he had 38 NHL games and Schneider only had 98 games, so that number shouldn't worry you so much."
EdmontonOilers,3bbnce,Spoonfeedme,1 point,Sun Jun 28 05:55:07 2015 UTC,"Talbot, unlike Scrivens or Fasth, has put up stellar numbers every step of his career. There is a lot of pedigree here to be optimistic about."

EdmontonOilers,3bbq12,ProfessorScribbles,8,Sat Jun 27 18:21:13 2015 UTC,Pretty sure we can. Same situation as last year I think. We can invite him to camp and sign him again if he plays well. He's old enough now as well. I didn't even think of that.
EdmontonOilers,3bbq12,Shottaz83,11,Sat Jun 27 18:29:15 2015 UTC,"Pleeeease invite him. There's literally almost no risk in bringing him to camp. If he performs the way he did last year, offer the kid a contract (an actually legal one this time around) and see what he's got.  He said he loved Edmonton, even months later. I mean I don't think it'll be a huge loss if we don't' take a shot at him, but I'd certainly be happy if we did."
EdmontonOilers,3bbq12,shweet44722,8,Sat Jun 27 18:44:01 2015 UTC,"Yeah and he turns 20 this October so he's AHL eligible. Worse be worse, we send him down there to keep working on his chemistry with Yakimov and Bakersfield gets even more stacked."

EdmontonOilers,3bbq12,Eyo27,2,Sat Jun 27 21:39:52 2015 UTC,"I would love to see us invite Appleby. He was immense in the playoffs and his numbers have been good for 2 seasons now. In fact, I'd offer him a contract before camp because I feel he's going to get a lot of interest in a few months."
EdmontonOilers,3bbq12,notsoyoungpadawan,7,Sat Jun 27 22:17:21 2015 UTC,"Little surprising. Would've hoped we could have got him with a late pick. We know what he can do, so why not take the risk with him? Not too bothered with it though, but it would've been nice."
EdmontonOilers,3bbq12,Shottaz83,7,Sat Jun 27 18:20:22 2015 UTC,We can grab him for free-ish now. I'm positive he'll get an invite.

EdmontonOilers,3bbq12,ipooblood,4,Sat Jun 27 20:46:53 2015 UTC,"I watched him here in Quebec. He's really weird. He makes dumb plays or his completely invisible for a lot of games. He's doing too many fancy plays that waste good scoring chances. But when he's on a good night and use is great speed and skill, he can explode and play like a 1rs star.   Here in Quebec we also had a lot of dept in offense and our coach didn't like him. He played a lot on the 3rd line, and in the Memorial Cup, he played 5 min per game."

EdmontonOilers,3bbfrl,oddspellingofPhreid,3,Sat Jun 27 19:04:43 2015 UTC,"Yes, but Marincin for a suspended 4th liner is a pretty significant undervaluement."
EdmontonOilers,3bbfrl,Loire55,4,Sat Jun 27 18:11:19 2015 UTC,Clears a roster spot we can use on a FA though. We need RHD more than LHD right now. Marty was just getting lower and lower on the depth chart and he was getting outplayed by everyone. We are seriously overvaluing him right now. People here are expecting him to be the next Chara and thats just ridiculous.
EdmontonOilers,3bbfrl,dblkll,4,Sat Jun 27 18:13:49 2015 UTC,"He was getting outplayed by Klefbom. That was it. No one else on our defensive squad was outplaying Marincin. That comment in itself damages the rest of your argument There's no guarantee Reinhart is going to turn out let alone out perform Marincin.   There's no vital need to have three RHD is just preferable. Many sound NHL teams, such as Detroit make due with LHD on the right. Essentially replacing Marincin with Gryba was a huge step down by all metrics."
EdmontonOilers,3bbfrl,DeuceBuggalo,2,Sat Jun 27 18:38:18 2015 UTC,"Say what you want , but Marty took a huge step back last year and looked very unimpressive when he played for us.

EdmontonOilers,3bbfrl,arcticcatherder,3,Sat Jun 27 18:28:29 2015 UTC,"We don't ""need"" to do anything.   I love the player in Reinhart, but not the price paid. Also because MacT Howson and Green are still around, it really smells of a classic Oilers lock-on to one player and get him no matter what move.    Green's quotes (""I didn't see him play in the AHL last year"" but what a great player he was for me in junior) are not at all reassuring that due diligence was done.   That said he remains a great prospect and I hope his size and meanness help us compete in a very big and tough division/conference.  The Talbot trade was pleasantly surprising, got him for less than we thought the price would be.  These two moves in concert however got us only 1 pick in the top-100 of a draft people are saying rivals 2003 in depth. That is a huge risk. I get that we have holes that need to be fixed now. But we will also need great skilled cheap young players to step into the lineup in a few years when McD's ELC is up and we face cap casualties (Hawks have been great at this).  And to sacrifice a shot at those players for Reinhart (yet to establish himself in the NHL) and Talbot (love the potential but not yet established as a starter, so far playing behind our shit D) is riskyyyyyy business. Maybe some of the teeth-knashing online is over the top but these moves are justifiably being criticized IMO."

Even in MacT's first year people were pissed after every move he made. My point is that we're giving Chiarelli a lot more leeway than he probably deserves.   The Marincin deal is terrible, Gryba is 27 and he's a 6/7 guy at best while Marincin, despite playing poorly, still has upside. Our D core is now full of guys who can't skate or move the puck on a team that's designed to be a fast paced skating team. This is why I have no idea why people want to get rid of Schultz for ""toughness""."
EdmontonOilers,3bbfrl,mooky1977,5,Sat Jun 27 17:02:44 2015 UTC,"Because Schultz can't make outlet passes and it is painful to watch.  *Agreed with all your other points though, Gryba at first glance is the new Keith Aulie/Mark Fraser player type (although more established). Hope I am wrong"

Do you think Marincin has no potential of being a top 4 guy? By your logic, D men has until 30 to hit tier prime Marincin has 7 more years and Gryba has 3 more, so which guy has more potential? Defenseman don't take 10 years to develop, they should start hitting their strides at around 25-27, name me some D who actually got better after 30."

I like how hes 6'5 and has a mean streak. Most of all i like how gryba can play for us next season, even if it is on 3rd pairing.   Marincin is a lhd who has a rep for being a little soft and tenative. Marincin had prospects pass over him on the left side (klefbom, reinhart now, nurse im sure is better). I didnt like marincins play in the olympics when he was paired with chara at the start, then dropped to 3rd pairing by the end.   And d men dont hit potential till 30-31, its literally been studied upon. Im not saying every guy doesnt get good till theyre 30, but most improve until so.

So your argument is that he has 2 years of experience, size, and decent plus minus? How does any of these things correlate to whether he's good or not? He's a 6/7 guy of which we have too many.

I didnt like marincins play in the olympics when he was paired with chara at the start, then dropped to 3rd pairing by the end.   I mean the guy is 23, I don't understand your logic that Gryba has potential at 27 and yet Marincin at 23 has all these flaws that can't be fixed. He was great the year before, so it's not like he hasn't shown that he's a good D.   And d men dont hit potential till 30-31, its literally been studied upon.

EdmontonOilers,3bbwz2,modest_rodent,4,Sat Jun 27 19:43:40 2015 UTC,That would be awesome if we offer sheeted Hamilton away from Calgary. It would make their trade completely useless.
EdmontonOilers,3bbwz2,johnedeadly,2,Sat Jun 27 22:53:33 2015 UTC,"depending on how much the Oilers offer, if its above 7.3 mill per year and Calgary does not match, then they get 2? first round picks ( I may be mistaken but at that $$ the picks are a lot the oilers would give up) in next years draft. The flames are smart, they did not make this trade without considering offer sheets, they will match or sit on a lot of picks in another deep draft."

EdmontonOilers,3bbwz2,tsn123456789,1 point,Sat Jun 27 19:46:27 2015 UTC,If it's not your natural position it quickly downgrades a defenceman. How you position your body and your stick all changes. How you dump the puck off the boards etc...all changes. It's ok for a little while (like while someone is out hurt) but I think it's a poor strategy going into a new season with that set up.
EdmontonOilers,3bbwz2,tsn123456789,6,Mon Jun 29 15:54:21 2015 UTC,"This UFA class is terrible, a lot of mediocre guys are going to get overpaid and I hope we're not one of those teams."
EdmontonOilers,3bbwz2,MacerV,1 point,Sat Jun 27 19:23:14 2015 UTC,Do you like any scenario where we sign Franson? I didn't really follow Toronto or Nashville but it seems like people dislike him a lot.
EdmontonOilers,3bbwz2,tsn123456789,2,Sat Jun 27 19:25:39 2015 UTC,"Depends on the salary. If we can get him for 4M (we won't) on not too long term he'd be solid, but someone is going to give him 5M+ and term. He's okay with the puck but horrendous without it. He also cannot skate and we have enough guys who can't. His ideal position is as a 3rd pairing offensive guy/PP Specialist like Schultz is right now, except people look at his point totals, hit totals, hard shot, and good CorsiRel and thinks he's a Top 4 guy. He also got worse when he went to Nashville which tanks his value even more."
EdmontonOilers,3bbwz2,MacerV,1 point,Sat Jun 27 19:29:47 2015 UTC,All signs point to him being a solid 2nd pairing guy who can quarterback your power play. If Franson is on your 3rd pairing you'd have to have a lot of depth.
EdmontonOilers,3bbwz2,tsn123456789,1 point,Sat Jun 27 19:33:19 2015 UTC,"What signs? I know he has good advanced stats, but so does Jake Gardiner and he was costing the Leafs games and getting benched by Carlyle. Franson leaves a lot to be desired when your team doesn't have the puck.  Edit: On EDM he can probably be a 2nd pairing, but that's not really saying much. If you want to compete for a playoff spot you can't have Franson as your 2nd pairing guy."

EdmontonOilers,3bbwz2,tsn123456789,1 point,Sat Jun 27 19:39:29 2015 UTC,"Which is what I said above, he's good with the puck and a solid PPQB, which is ideal on the third pairing. Points aren't everything. 46 of his 94 pts came off of the PP or 49% of his offense, so his PPG in 5on5 situations is 0.268. Justin Schultz has 0.256 PPG (over 3 years) in 5on5 situations, and people give him a ton of shit on this board. Schultz is also younger and cheaper than Franson. The main issue with Franson is his play without the puck, which is terrible. Plus his skating is pretty bad and the Oil is a team that's built on skating.  Edit: You also left out his time with Nashville where he put up 4pts in 23 games."
EdmontonOilers,3bbwz2,A5hcrack,1 point,Sat Jun 27 19:47:32 2015 UTC,"You mean in Nashville where despite being loaded with right shot defenseman they traded for another one at the deadline to get through an injury, and barely put him on the ice once they got their boy back? His play didn't fall off in Nashville, his ice time did. Wasn't on the power play, was behind Jones and Webber for 5on5 ice time. Third pair guys not on the PP don't put up points. When their third Right shot D-man came back from an injury he got squeezed out even further because they wanted to go with the guy that had been in the system all year.   And the Oil was, repeat was, a team built on skating. Not sure if you caught the trades the last couple days but everything they brought over was a tree on the back end. I think Oiler hockey as we know it just died."

I understand the circumstances in Nashville, he was badly misused, but the point of the poster above is that he can put up points but just ignored the last 23 games of the season to fit his narrative. Regardless my point is not his offense as I've said, but his play without the puck.   And the Oil was, repeat was, a team built on skating. Not sure if you caught the trades the last couple days but everything they brought over was a tree on the back end. I think Oiler hockey as we know it just died.

EdmontonOilers,3bbwz2,ProfessorScribbles,1 point,Sat Jun 27 22:36:20 2015 UTC,"The point is; new management, new coach, drastic changes in the make up of the defense probably means a new style of play. They want trees, that leads me to believe that what they're doing system-wise, requires big, gritty guys that are going to pass, rather than carry on breakouts.   And while I agree that ignoring games to fit your narrative is usually BS, his situation here would be absolutely nothing like his situation in Nashville. Which makes the games completely irrelivent to whether he's a fit for the Oilers."

Martin for more money less  term if needed, ideally of course low money, low term, 2 players for less than $12 mil hopefully.  Tlusty, Fleischmann or someone better to slot in as our third line LW, hopefully $3-3.5 mill or less.  Comeau or someone better for third line RW. hopefully $1.5mil or less, unless it's Frolik, than if he can take similar money to this year.  If you can't fill a wing spot, I'm not adverse to bringing back Roy for 1.5 mil or less, shifting Lander to the wing, putting Yakupov on his wing, and trying Tlusty/Fleishmann,Comeau on 2nd line RW for a little bit.  UFA winger signing could be an extra forward if a prospect shows he can stick.  Pouliot - RNH - Eberle  Hall - McDavid - Yakupov  Tlusty/Fleishmann - Lander - Comeau/Frolik  Hendy - Gordon - Klinkhammer  Martin/Sekara - Franson/Green  Klefbom - Fayne  Ference - Gryba   Nurse  - Schultz  Talbot - Scrivens  I'd look into trading for players better than the top  two D, and third line wingers instead of signing if possible.  From a conservative Moneyballesque standpoint the team is good for at least 210 goals in my opinion. At least 23rd in the league if it was 2014-15.  20/25/25  25/20/20  15/10/10  5/5/5  5/5  5/2  2/2  2/2"

EdmontonOilers,3bbn3x,envague,8,Sat Jun 27 19:26:43 2015 UTC,"On Marincin, he simply disappointed last season. It was hard to reconcile his current form (soft and lackadaisical) with his emergent potential and quantum leap in play for Slovakia during the WHC (smart, composed with bursts of excitement). Chiarelli's dictum that he wanted players who played ""hard and heavy"" resonate here. If the final sum total of the deal is Marincin for Gryba while making room for Reinhart this deal makes sense."
EdmontonOilers,3bbn3x,Shottaz83,7,Sat Jun 27 18:07:08 2015 UTC,"Agreed, people are overvaluing him a lot. Hes good, but people expect him to be the next Chara, and thats never going to happen. He was getting passed by everyone on the depth chart and simply getting outplayed."
EdmontonOilers,3bbn3x,eatingasspatties,7,Sat Jun 27 18:15:56 2015 UTC,He got the Smid treatment here. He wasn't bad which made him a God compared to the other scrubs.

EdmontonOilers,3bbn3x,notsoyoungpadawan,5,Sat Jun 27 18:30:56 2015 UTC,"Apparently he was quite out of shape too and at loggerheads with the organization. Getting Gryba was an obvious upgrade. Marincin has a slightly higher upside, but not that much higher, so I'm ok with this. Gryba is going to teach our kids how to stick up for your teammates and not take shit from opposition guys."
EdmontonOilers,3bbn3x,Shottaz83,2,Sat Jun 27 20:09:30 2015 UTC,"Well said, I like the move, even though others may not. Gryba is a big strong defensive defensman, who will help our young group a lot.

EdmontonOilers,3bbn3x,Shottaz83,1 point,Sat Jun 27 18:20:49 2015 UTC,"Are they comparable? Gryba has played 132 games in the past 2 years and is a +20. Marty has played 85 games in the past 2 years and is -6.  Gryba is 27 to Marty's 23, but Gryba is actually physically ready for the NHL. Marty seems quite far off when it comes to that."
EdmontonOilers,3bbn3x,tsn123456789,4,Sat Jun 27 21:08:22 2015 UTC,"How does GP and plus minus say anything? Trouba played 130 games in two years and is plus 6 and he's one of the best young D in the league. Those are terrible metrics you are using to compare players. It's not like Marincin is super old and an career AHLer, he spent his earlier years in the A to grow like every D not in the first round. By this logic Reinhart is not as good/proven as Marincin because he's played 10x less NHL games than Marincin and actually scored less than Marincin in his first pro year. Gryba might be physically ready sure, but he's also peaked while Marincin isn't."
EdmontonOilers,3bbn3x,Shottaz83,1 point,Sat Jun 27 21:13:41 2015 UTC,"The point I'm trying to make is, the deal right now makes us better. Marty may not have peaked yet, but if you look at his stats and physical development it looks like it won't be much higher than it already is. Marty is being seriously overvalued by Oilers fans because he played decent a couple years ago. He isn't a future top 4 guy, as much as people here seem to think so. Best case scenario for him, he plays 3rd pairing."
EdmontonOilers,3bbn3x,tsn123456789,4,Sat Jun 27 21:17:13 2015 UTC,"He's really just a year removed from playing well so it wasn't a couple of years ago. As far as Gryba goes, he's at where Marty is now, he's a dime in a dozen player. None of us can tell the future, Petry came into his own this year at 27, I have a hard time believing that after one year of regression we should expect Marincin to stagnate for the next 4 years; he definitely has potential, Gryba doesn't, best case scenario is that this trade is a wash. Could it also be that Oiler fans are overvaluing Gryba? From what I hear he's been crap in Ottawa."
EdmontonOilers,3bbn3x,0ILERS,2,Sat Jun 27 21:23:59 2015 UTC,"Great point. Marincin, while not a small guy, did  not play hard and heavy. Gryba and Reinhart certainly do, as well as have the ability to make a good first pass. I see Gryba as a better version of Smid, and Reinhart as Matt Greene (in his Oilers days) type."

His value is too low right now because of his performance (or lack there of) under Eakins.  He started playing a lot better when Nelson took over though.  I would hope that, under TMac, that he can continue to improve and his value goes up to the max of his potential."
EdmontonOilers,3bbn3x,BouquetofDicks,1 point,Sat Jun 27 20:42:18 2015 UTC,"He could be seen as a bit of a wildcard now with regards to his potential (ie: the blame lies on Eakins, not Yak).  If he were to have a disappointing season under TMac , then his trade value would really drop.   That being said, Yak is awesome and I really want him to grow with the Oilers organization."
EdmontonOilers,3bbn3x,azure_888,5,Sat Jun 27 22:41:39 2015 UTC,"If you have a look at what Chia did this draft, you can see that he's looking towards the future. Instead of picking up Barzal, who could have spent another 2-3 years in juniors, he traded for Reinhart, someone who already played his first pro season. Instead of developing Marincin (who definitely has more upside), he moved for a RHD in Gryba, someone who was a regular roster player. Chia is looking at the Eberle-Hall-Nuge contracts and sees a closing window, and he looks like he's not afraid to trade some picks to improve the team now."
EdmontonOilers,3bbn3x,envague,4,Sat Jun 27 18:01:15 2015 UTC,"Good point. I was watching the draft with a couple Edmonton pals and got into a debate about the deals made yesterday and what's best for the team. At this point I'm not interested in winning trades on an individual basis. MacT did well in loading us up with a ploughshare of draft picks, if we turn them over into players who are able to play for us now and make us better in the near rather than distant future I'm happy."
EdmontonOilers,3bbn3x,notsoyoungpadawan,3,Sat Jun 27 18:21:14 2015 UTC,"I also don't think he had much faith in our scouts' knowledge. It was probably always his plan to trade those draft picks (its probably why he fired all those scouts right before the draft) and his fall back option was just to pick BPA. He'll probably bring his people in for next year's draft so there is a good chance we draft a lot more kids next year.   On Reinhart, I think people need to give him time. He's still very young and I liked what Chia said about how sometimes its not simply about the quality of a defenceman, but also how his situation plays out.. And Reinhart himself said that he was low on confidence throughout the year. I could totally see Bob Green revitalizing him in the next year or so back to being very good a top 3 D."
EdmontonOilers,3bbn3x,oilernut,5,Sat Jun 27 20:16:49 2015 UTC,the fact of the matter is we are a much better team than we were a few days ago.
EdmontonOilers,3bbn3x,0ILERS,1 point,Sat Jun 27 18:02:41 2015 UTC,Our top 4 is still a major concern though. Hopefully PC has something cooking on that front. Whether it be a trade with a cap-strapped team or picking up Sekera in FA.
EdmontonOilers,3bbn3x,Hipst4r,6,Sun Jun 28 02:28:56 2015 UTC,2015 NHL Roster as of today. $7.7M in cap space. Lots of room for another defenseman.
EdmontonOilers,3bbn3x,dcmcderm,4,Sat Jun 27 18:24:58 2015 UTC,That's enough room for a contract dump to get rid of Ference/ Nikitin and another defenseman
EdmontonOilers,3bbn3x,Dr_Gd_N_Sxxy,3,Sat Jun 27 18:29:37 2015 UTC,"McDavid has a $3.75 M cap hit?  That doesn't sound right, won't he just get a standard ELC for peanuts like all other rookies?  EDIT - found this.  There are a bunch of performance based bonuses included in ELCs, and for the purposes of the cap calculation it's assumed all will be reached...So this seems to be saying that all ELC's count as $3.75M cap hit in case?  Still doesn't seem right to me."
EdmontonOilers,3bbn3x,notsoyoungpadawan,4,Sat Jun 27 20:08:49 2015 UTC,"$925,000 cap hit, plus I expect him to reach all if his bonuses to a max of $3,775,000."

EdmontonOilers,3bbn3x,0ILERS,7,Sat Jun 27 19:06:00 2015 UTC,Nah. $7m for Mike Green would be spending a ridiculous amount of money on the type of D Chia doesn't like.
EdmontonOilers,3bbn3x,notsoyoungpadawan,2,Sat Jun 27 20:20:11 2015 UTC,"Who knows though, maybe grewn likes the idea of playing in a very offensive minded system"
EdmontonOilers,3bbn3x,shweet44722,1 point,Sat Jun 27 21:09:52 2015 UTC,"Man, that's one pricy 7th defenseman..."
EdmontonOilers,3bbn3x,haterbehatin,6,Sun Jun 28 02:30:08 2015 UTC,"Comment from OilersNation:   It's more likely that the 16th and 33rd would be like trading Marc Andre Pouliot and David Musil for Griffin [Reinhart]   I like this outlook. Sure, we may have traded Perry and Karlsson for Reinhart, but statistically speaking its much more likely we didnt. Reinhart looks like a real player. Not a top 2 guy, but a good top 4 defenseman.   I'm happy with this draft. Sets us up well in the next few seasons."
EdmontonOilers,3bbn3x,notsoyoungpadawan,3,Sat Jun 27 19:34:17 2015 UTC,"He is a very good leader as well, and can eat up a lot of minutes. He was projected to become a top 2 D-man when the Isles took him. I don't believe that is out of the question even after this past season, because regardless of how that went, he is still only 21. I still expect Yak to become an elite winger, so at 21, a defenceman is way too young to be projected as a bust or anything like that."
EdmontonOilers,3bbn3x,haterbehatin,5,Sat Jun 27 21:10:31 2015 UTC,"Gryba...not sure how I feel about Gryba. He's not bad, but watching him while in Ottawa he has his moments of brillance but incredible incompetence too. Buuut he's a good size RHD entering his prime and was 3rd on the Sens this past season in iCorsi/60 which isn't half bad. At a $1.25M cap hit he'll be better than Nikitin and Ference for far less, but, like Talbot, is going to be a UFA next offseason."
EdmontonOilers,3bbn3x,shweet44722,1 point,Sat Jun 27 18:15:34 2015 UTC,"I don't like it at all. He's another bottom pairing guy.   Unless it means that Nikitin is gone and Ference is the 7th defensemen.   But that still means you either have to get rid of Schultz for an upgrade or your right side sucks.  Plus they added Reinhart yesterday who is also a big slow defenseman, so now the d core in general is getting bigger and slower but the team needs guys who can create offense.   It's like the league is getting quicker and more mobile on the back end and Chiarelli is saying wait I know, we'll get bigger and slower instead."
EdmontonOilers,3bbn3x,haterbehatin,9,Sat Jun 27 19:46:17 2015 UTC,"I could see Nikitin and Ference gone by October for picks.  Size is still a huge strength in the NHL, and Reinhart isn't slow for his size. Moreover, he has said he's working with a trainer on his coaching in this off-season, so in a year or two I'm sure his foot speed will increase. And our offense is so quick that it won't matter. We just need a d-man who can move the puck and get it to our forward guys. We have enough speed in defence with Klefbom and Nurse. There needs to be a balance. Look at how Ducks built their defence."
EdmontonOilers,3bbn3x,shweet44722,5,Sat Jun 27 20:27:16 2015 UTC,It'd be great if Ference left but he has a NMC.   I think it's a misconception that guys can just get great at their foot speed if that was the case Luke Schenn would be a great player and Alex Plante wouldn't be just another in a long line of Edmonton Oilers first round busts.   If the offense is quick the defense needs to be equally quick to stay with the play.  I think the Ducks have a large number of young excellent skating defensemen.They definitely have more than two of them.
EdmontonOilers,3bbn3x,haterbehatin,5,Sat Jun 27 20:32:56 2015 UTC,"Well that's kind of how I see it at this point. Gryba isn't exactly ideal, but he's better and much cheaper than Nikitin and Ference, which means it pushes one of them down the depth chart and partway out the door.  I thought one of Reinhart's strength was his speed? That's what eliteprospects mentioned at any rate I think."
EdmontonOilers,3bbn3x,darkstar107,3,Sat Jun 27 19:50:46 2015 UTC,I've just heard he's big and slow. I just checked out his profile.   It says skates well for his frame but looks to be a 2011 scouting report.  So maybe he hasn't progressed as expected since then. I'm not sure I hope he turns out to be an excellent skater but I think if that's the case he would've cracked the Islanders lineup and they wouldn't be moving him.
EdmontonOilers,3bbn3x,haterbehatin,2,Sat Jun 27 19:56:18 2015 UTC,"I hope so. Well, not necessarily, the Isles are stacked at D and have good prospects on the farm. But I guess we'll see. I know a lot of people like him from the Oil Kings, but the dub and the NHL are obviously very different leagues."
EdmontonOilers,3bbn3x,shweet44722,5,Sat Jun 27 20:03:40 2015 UTC,I hope he works out but I'm a little concerned by the quote I just saw of Green saying he never saw him play this year but he was good with the Oil Kings.  Like are you fucking kidding me your scouting report is based on how he played in Jr not how he played at a much higher level.   Surely someone actually saw him play... I hope and they're not just falling back on what they saw him do in Edmonton.
EdmontonOilers,3bbn3x,TheTravellingMan,6,Sat Jun 27 20:21:05 2015 UTC,"He only played 8 games with NYI, had 1 point and was +1.  This trade could go either way, but he has more potential than any defenseman that we could have taken with the picks that we traded for him.  Seems like a lot of people don't like the trade for Reinhardt, but I do."
EdmontonOilers,3bbn3x,RussellsFedora,2,Sat Jun 27 20:46:55 2015 UTC,Sure but that doesn't mean it wasn't an overpay.   Obviously I would've preferred the Hamilton deal to have worked out but it didn't so oh well.   I wouldn't have minded this one if it was 16th pick straight across but with that 33rd pick I think it was too much.
EdmontonOilers,3bbn3x,Shottaz83,2,Sat Jun 27 20:51:35 2015 UTC,I mean...I hope someone actually saw him play. Really hope. Maybe they went with Garth Snow's word or something...idk.
EdmontonOilers,3bbn3x,tsn123456789,4,Sun Jun 28 02:18:55 2015 UTC,"Well it was certainly exciting. Someone is probably going to look real stupid on the Reinhart trade in three years but hell if I could tell you who. Talbot was a great pick up, but I don't know why Vancouver refuses to trade with us no matter the cost. I reconciled Marty leaving a while ago so that wasn't really a surprise, he doesn't play Chia and Tmac's game and was a healthy scratch for part of OKC's playoff run. Gryba isn't exactly someone I'd say I'm excited to see play but if he does his job I'll be happy enough."
EdmontonOilers,3bbn3x,Giggleplex,2,Sat Jun 27 18:22:29 2015 UTC,"OP, can you put the picks that we shipped out and revived as well?   EDIT: I'm just blind :P"
EdmontonOilers,3bbn3x,tsn123456789,2,Sat Jun 27 17:58:39 2015 UTC,"Really really happy with how it all went down. Got Talbot for less than NY wanted. Got Reinhart who is close to being NHL ready, and drafted McFuckingDavid #1 overall. We also drafted really really well late in the draft with Jones, Bear and Marino. All good young D-men with a lot of upside. We lost Marty, but he wasn't a fit here anymore, which was pretty clear, while also freeing up a contract spot. So happy right now, and Free Agency hasn't even begun yet! Can't wait to see what Chia does in the coming weeks with all of the UFA's on the market."

EdmontonOilers,3bbd9j,oddspellingofPhreid,8,Sat Jun 27 16:25:41 2015 UTC,This is a good pick. He was ranked in the top 100 in every ranking. RHD and puck mover. Weird the Bruins didn't grab him due to the name.
EdmontonOilers,3bbd9j,tsn123456789,8,Sat Jun 27 16:32:39 2015 UTC,He was ranked too high for Sweeney to select him.
EdmontonOilers,3bbd9j,arcticcatherder,3,Sat Jun 27 16:42:05 2015 UTC,"Yeah, seems like a good pick to me."
EdmontonOilers,3bbd9j,tsn123456789,2,Sat Jun 27 16:33:44 2015 UTC,"He also just turned 18 yesterday, so he's one of the younger guys in the draft"
EdmontonOilers,3bbd9j,Loire55,6,Sat Jun 27 16:34:29 2015 UTC,18 year old Ethan Bear?
EdmontonOilers,3bbd9j,shweet44722,2,Sat Jun 27 16:35:42 2015 UTC,How was Sweeney today in comparison to yesterday?
EdmontonOilers,3bbd9j,ProfessorScribbles,6,Sat Jun 27 19:21:56 2015 UTC,IIRC Lowetide was saying we should grab this guy with our first 3rd.  Getting him here seems pretty good to me.
EdmontonOilers,3bbd9j,ipooblood,7,Sat Jun 27 16:30:56 2015 UTC,Can't believe he fell to us. This guy played top line minutes with Theodore and excelled in the position. He needs a couple more years in the dub but I believe he could represent Canada at the WJC even next year. His offensive game is beginning to flourish.
EdmontonOilers,3bbd9j,BringBackTheWhalers,4,Sat Jun 27 16:37:25 2015 UTC,"Hey Edmonton fans! I've seen this kid play in Seattle over the last couple of years and FWIW, I really think he'll end up being one of the steals of the draft. He played very calm and collected as a 16 y/o last season and contributed well to our team. He is a good skater, makes a great first pass, and rarely makes the wrong decision. This season he took his game up a notch and improved on all areas of his game. He also possesses a great shot from the point and was a regular on our team's power play. He looked comfortable playing top line minutes when our D core was depleted but also slotted in on the 3rd pair later in the season (coaching decision paired with chemistry for first two D pairs) and still played great. Barzal and Theodore were our best two players this year (no shit, I know) but I honestly put more stock in Bear than anyone else, including Gropp and Kolesar (though they are both good players as well). I think he could take some years of seasoning but I really think he could make it to the show some day."
EdmontonOilers,3bbd9j,Shottaz83,2,Sat Jun 27 18:15:50 2015 UTC,I like him already! Thanks for the insight.
EdmontonOilers,3bbd9j,DocDiggler,2,Sat Jun 27 18:25:39 2015 UTC,Thanks man. Should be interesting to see iwhen Theodore moves on. is he going to be the next top pairing guy for Seattle you figure?
EdmontonOilers,3bbd9j,BringBackTheWhalers,1 point,Sat Jun 27 23:35:46 2015 UTC,"Yep, I assume so. Theodore will almost certainly be elsewhere and they're also losing another defenseman(Evan wardley) who is aging out. So he'll slot into that top defenseman role, just a matter of who he pairs with. I think(and hope) they make a push for this to be our season based on our team and who is returning as well as how other teams probably will be regressing. And bear should be a huge part of that success!!"
EdmontonOilers,3bbd9j,Ebs14,3,Sun Jun 28 01:43:38 2015 UTC,"YES! I don't follow the draft past the first/early second round or eligible players too often, but the Oilers draft primers all mention Bear as a pick of interest to the Oilers. Seems like a great fit. Chiarelli with a monster weekend"
EdmontonOilers,3bbd9j,Shottaz83,3,Sat Jun 27 16:47:18 2015 UTC,Wow! Amazing pick for us. Was very highly ranked and is a RHD which we desperatly need. So happy he fell to us.

I don't think many of us expect a playoff team next year, but our new look back end gives me a whole lot more confidence going forward. They're a young group with a lot of size, and if Klefbom, Nurse, and Reinhart continue to develop, and McLellan can unlock Schultz, we look pretty good 2 years down the line."
EdmontonOilers,3bayhe,notsoyoungpadawan,2,Sat Jun 27 17:05:29 2015 UTC,A day that started off so well ended quite poorly. All we've done is sign more 3rd line D-men instead of trying to grab some top 2 pairing D-men. I'm quite disappointed.

EdmontonOilers,3bayhe,BasketballNut,2,Sat Jun 27 16:20:20 2015 UTC,we just traded for Eric Gryba from the Senators for 107th pick and Travis Ewanyk.
EdmontonOilers,3bayhe,haterbehatin,1 point,Sat Jun 27 16:06:08 2015 UTC,Oh look another bottom pairing defenseman. Another winner by Chia.
EdmontonOilers,3bayhe,IAMA-CANADIAN-AMA,5,Sat Jun 27 16:08:47 2015 UTC,Let's us maybe lose nikitin
EdmontonOilers,3bayhe,haterbehatin,1 point,Sat Jun 27 16:26:37 2015 UTC,They could've done that anyways though.   Marincin for Gryba is sideways at best.
EdmontonOilers,3bayhe,Robbap,2,Sat Jun 27 16:27:15 2015 UTC,"It's a downward trade IMO, but it removes a LHD and brings in a RHD which is where we're shallow"
EdmontonOilers,3bayhe,haterbehatin,1 point,Sat Jun 27 16:43:59 2015 UTC,"I like the lefty righty thing too if possible but I don't think it validates this move.   If you move Marty out because he's not part of your plan for the roster that makes sense, but why go get a Gryba?   Why not use that roster spot and find a guy who can play with Klefbom."
EdmontonOilers,3bayhe,IAMA-CANADIAN-AMA,2,Sat Jun 27 16:47:51 2015 UTC,Wasn't marincin going to be a free agent? Maybe he was asking for to much
EdmontonOilers,3bayhe,haterbehatin,1 point,Sat Jun 27 16:35:26 2015 UTC,He's restricted but he was also going to be waiver eligible this year so if he wasn't part of the plans it made sense to move him.  But why replace a bottom pairing guy with another bottom pairing guy?
EdmontonOilers,3bayhe,El_reverso,2,Sat Jun 27 16:44:46 2015 UTC,"Gryba is supposed to have the grit that Marty lacked. I imagine they are trying to match grit with skill and keep size all around.  I really hope they take a run at Cody Franson now. I really like his game. Colby Armstrong had nothing but good things to say about his time on the leafs, and Nashville gave up a first to get him back. Teams rarely trade for a still young player they once had. I'd like it if our pairings next year went; Klef - Franson Nurse - Fayne Reinhart/Ference - Schultz/Gryba"
EdmontonOilers,3bayhe,haterbehatin,2,Sat Jun 27 20:04:09 2015 UTC,Yeah those pairings would be a lot better Gryba wouldn't be terrible if he's the 7th defenseman but Ference should ideally be in that role.   Franson or Green could both work depending on price and term.  I have the feeling Nurse starts in Bakersfield next year or maybe Reinhart does.
EdmontonOilers,3bayhe,El_reverso,2,Sat Jun 27 20:46:13 2015 UTC,"That's what I think too. Chiarelli basically got Reinhart so that Nurse has to beat him out. I honestly wouldn't put it past him, probably has a chip on his shoulder over the hockey canada snub two years ago. (They took Reinhart instead of Nurse even though Reinhart would have to serve a 3 game suspension before playing)"
EdmontonOilers,3bayhe,speedonthis,2,Sat Jun 27 22:44:44 2015 UTC,So are we legit going after a RHD now or something? Because that's the only way I can wrap my head around this trade.
EdmontonOilers,3bayhe,speedonthis,3,Sat Jun 27 16:04:13 2015 UTC,Eric Gryba is an Oiler.

EdmontonOilers,3bayhe,YAK_ATTACK_CALL_911,2,Sat Jun 27 17:09:34 2015 UTC,That's what I'm wondering. I can see moving Marincin but why move Marincin to bring in Gryba? Just seems dumb. Why add a puck mover to a team that can't score goals when you can add big slow and useless.

EdmontonOilers,3bayhe,mkwong,2,Sat Jun 27 15:07:14 2015 UTC,So where does Chiarelli turn his sights next? Is there another defenseman available? perhaps Spurgeon? or do they look to free agency to add another defender?

EdmontonOilers,3bayhe,notsoyoungpadawan,4,Sat Jun 27 15:26:28 2015 UTC,Jesus christ. Speculation that this is could be among the best drafts of all time and we trade away 4 picks in the top 90. Good deal for Talbot but can't help and be a little disappointed. Two years in a row with very few mid round picks.
EdmontonOilers,3bayhe,notsoyoungpadawan,3,Sat Jun 27 14:55:01 2015 UTC,"The Talbot deal is a 2nd, a third and a 5th? or 4th?  I like this Talbot deal, still not a fan of the Reinhart deal. I don't mind acquiring Reinhart but it seems like a ton for a guy who is a defense prospect, he's also hugely overrated around here because Oil Kings."
EdmontonOilers,3bayhe,jessetherrien,3,Sat Jun 27 14:57:32 2015 UTC,"Would you be fan of the Reinhart deal if Calgary didnt steal Hamilton? I feel the same but it was said the Oilers had the same deal but Boston also wanted Nurse, so in that case i think the Trade was probably a win win for Oil and Isles. Also Calgary will have to pay Hamilton like 7 mill, Griffin has more potential and could be signed for around 4 million."
EdmontonOilers,3bayhe,notsoyoungpadawan,2,Sat Jun 27 15:30:40 2015 UTC,"I would've liked it if it was the 16th straight across.   The Bruins wanted Nurse as part of a package, the Oilers offered the three picks that were basically better than what Calgary ended up getting him for.   Hamilton is worth 7 million because he's 22 and already a top 2 or at the very least top 4 defenseman.   Reinhart is a prospect with 8 NHL games, he might be great but he's not anywhere close to where Hamilton already is. So I don't think it's fair to say Griffin has more potential, you hope Reinhart becomes what Hamilton already is.   I don't think trading for Reinhart was a bad move, I think including that 2nd rounder made it just a bit too much."
EdmontonOilers,3bayhe,jessetherrien,2,Sat Jun 27 15:36:33 2015 UTC,I'm in total agreement with you. It especially hurts with the Hamilton deal with Calgary for just one more second rounder. Reinhardt isn't proven for both picks. And now we have hardly any left with Talbot. I like him too but Lack went for less again (though I'm sure our price was higher being a rival).
EdmontonOilers,3bayhe,AlleyBj,1 point,Sat Jun 27 15:48:22 2015 UTC,I really would have liked Kylington but Talbot can be our guy for a long time.

Other than that, hopefully we can sign one of Mike Green or Cody Franson because those are the only two RHD who are good enough to improve our defence. I'd sign Franson (even if its around $5-$5.5m) and try to move Nikitin. We would absolutely have a much better defence than last season."
EdmontonOilers,3b9roy,AllisGreat,5,Sat Jun 27 05:39:21 2015 UTC,Can't believe the same people who want to get rid of Nikitin because of his 2 year contract want to sign Franson for 5m+.
EdmontonOilers,3b9roy,tsn123456789,6,Sat Jun 27 06:28:42 2015 UTC,There is a stark difference between Nikitin and Franson. You can't even compare the two.

EdmontonOilers,3b958v,envague,5,Sat Jun 27 00:05:48 2015 UTC,I'm sure they're expensive enough to cover the $10 in fabric it will cost to make them. Keep in mind the teams can make these at cost.

EdmontonOilers,3b9k4p,IamMcLovin2015,5,Sat Jun 27 02:25:58 2015 UTC,"I really hope he works out. Such a risky move in my opinion. Two early picks in a deep draft for a guy who hasn't been developing as quickly as he should have been. Hopefully it works out though, but it seems like a lot considering Barzal was still available. If he can turn into a top 4 guy for us, I'd be thrilled. I trust our management though, and that feels good.  Now the question is about our goaltending. What the hell does Chia have planned? Do we sign a free agent? Do we trade one of our LHD for a proven goalie? Do we draft one at 57? What kind of package do we need to put together to get a legitimate #1?  Also on top of all of this, we have fucking MCDAVID!!! Lets not forget about that! The McDavid era has started, and I can't wait for the next couple months too see what happens with our team."
EdmontonOilers,3b9k4p,Shottaz83,4,Sat Jun 27 02:29:42 2015 UTC,Well last guy Isles gave up on early (Nino) is doing pretty well. I think he partly didn't develop quickly and partly was buried with the addition of Boychuk and Leddy. Isles has like 10 guys who should play in the NHL.
EdmontonOilers,3b9k4p,tsn123456789,1 point,Sat Jun 27 02:33:19 2015 UTC,"I forgot about Nino, good point. They did give up on him really early, hopefully it works out for both of us. But more D prospects is never bad for us. We just need more NHL ready guys and a starting goaltender and we'll be set for next year."
EdmontonOilers,3b9k4p,Shottaz83,3,Sat Jun 27 02:39:31 2015 UTC,Personally I think Barzal will be the the better player and whoever goes at 33 will be solid as well so at best this trade is a wash and worst we threw away two really valuable picks for nothing.
EdmontonOilers,3b9k4p,tsn123456789,2,Sat Jun 27 07:03:38 2015 UTC,"Here is a comment from an Isles fan in 2014 on an oilers blog when Oilers were thinking about trading our 3rd overall 2014 pick for Reinhart:  They'd be stupid not to take the deal? Why is that, exactly?  Like the Oilers, the Islanders have a bunch of young, exciting prospects, and a lot of people believe with a few changes (such as an upgrade in goal), we can compete ASAP. We'll need to, as Buffalo will most likely have our 2015 1st rounder as part of the Vanek trade.  With many smallish defensemen in the system, the Islanders badly need a defensive anchor who can protect a lead. Obviously Reinhart is a physical defenseman, and there are many others in our system who have the potential to bring offense from the blueline. Reinhart is not one of those players: we're more looking for him to turn into our team's Ryan Suter.  In terms of development, he's done nothing but exceed expectations since being drafted two years ago. He's captained the Oil Kings to a WHL final and has been praised for his shutdown defensive work all series. Beat reporters for the Islanders say Reinhart is the favorite to earn a spot out of training camp next year.  Why then, would we trade him for the third overall to pick another forward? The way this draft is shaping up with high-end forward prospects in the top 10, we're already going to pick up somebody with the fifth pick. We don't need another, not with Tavares, Okposo, Strome, Nelson, Lee and other young talented forwards who've already cemented themselves in the lineup.  Trading Reinhart for the 3rd overall sets back the rebuild. Do we take Sam Bennett, wait until 2017 and then trade him for a 1st round pick? At a certain point you have to trust in the blue chip prospects you draft, and I fully believe the Islanders have enough trust in Reinhart that it would be a very easy pass from Snow on this proposed trade.  Nevermind not a single person close to the Islanders has made any mention of Reinhart being on the trade block or the Isles looking to get rid of him. When Nino was acting up, the story leaked everywhere. All I've heard from anybody involved is that there's definite hype surrounding this kid's NHL debut.  I doubt you can come up with some proof from Long Island sources saying Reinhart is on the outs, or that Snow would look to move him in the offseason. Like the Oilers, the Islanders have spent too many years rebuilding and taking quality prospects in the draft to once again delay the rebuild and move NHL-ready assets for draft picks."
EdmontonOilers,3b9k4p,Icekommander,3,Sat Jun 27 03:26:06 2015 UTC,Risky does indeed seem like the word. And frankly I'm not sure that risk is what this franchise needs at the moment.
EdmontonOilers,3b9k4p,oilernut,3,Sat Jun 27 02:43:13 2015 UTC,The safe move would be doing nothing. And how has that worked for us so far?  No team is going to give us a sure bet improvement in a trade.
EdmontonOilers,3b9k4p,crazycatman69,2,Sat Jun 27 14:36:56 2015 UTC,Sitting on our hands is what has got us here. We need risk now.
EdmontonOilers,3b9k4p,notsoyoungpadawan,2,Sat Jun 27 15:16:31 2015 UTC,"Its really not that risky. I just think everyone's overreacting because he's not progressed as well as everyone expected him to this year. But defencemen take longer to develop anyway, so its nothing too out of the ordinary. Take a look at this article on Reinhart from a pro-Isles website: http://islesbeat.com/2015/06/a-reality-check-on-griffin-reinhart/  Another link: http://lowetide.ca/2015/06/26/oilers-trade-no-16-for-griffin-reinhart/  From everyone who's watched him regularly say they're excited by this deal and that we've done well. He's going to be a very good player for us."
EdmontonOilers,3b9k4p,Frostdavid,1 point,Sat Jun 27 05:43:48 2015 UTC,I personally believe this is regaining another D prospect to replace whomever it is that we will be shipping out in a trade for a goaltender. Had to take it while it was there so we weren't left out to dry.
EdmontonOilers,3b9k4p,Giggleplex,1 point,Sat Jun 27 02:32:03 2015 UTC,"risky maybe but there is more pluses than negatives in my opinion....hes huge and i think oilers really need that big presence on the ice, him and darnell are gonna be beasts i think. Also we want to have all of our players hitting their stride at the same time so its good he has had some development time already and we didnt draft another 18 yo ...lots of potential and fills a huge need for oilers. For goaltending i honestly dont care that much, good goalies are easy to come by and the players infront of them have a big impact on performance.. our D problems were way more important and now thats starting to look better and better."
EdmontonOilers,3b9k4p,MrSlipp,1 point,Sat Jun 27 02:42:12 2015 UTC,I foresee Reinhart being the stay-at-home defender and Nurse being the guy who can jump into the rush. Reinhart possesses very high hockey IQ that Nurse lacks and has a hard shot from the blueline (as you can see here).   Perhaps many of us are undervaluing his abilities?

EdmontonOilers,3b970t,Loire55,2,Sat Jun 27 03:14:17 2015 UTC,Smytty is synonymous with Captain Canada. I never saw Paul Henderson play but I'm not dumb enough to recognize his elder statesman status and that it might align with a patriot like Smyth.
EdmontonOilers,3b970t,Loire55,1 point,Sat Jun 27 06:38:05 2015 UTC,"Again, the last time Smyth played in a serious international role McDavid was 7. Unless the kid follows the Spengler cup he has zero knowledge or memory of Ryan Smyth. I love and cherish Smyth as much, if not more, than the next Oilers fan but he doesn't mean much to non-fans anymore and there's very little reason the reporter should have thought McDavid would have any serious reaction to the idea of living with Smyth."
EdmontonOilers,3b970t,notsoyoungpadawan,1 point,Sat Jun 27 06:45:01 2015 UTC,And yet I was never alive when Henderson scored against Russia and as a simple fan I'm plainly aware of his contributions. Gretzky was infamous for his knowledge/fetish of Canadian hockey history. Future Canadian Olympians/National team captains only sleep on Smyth at their own peril.
EdmontonOilers,3b970t,lyrapan,2,Sat Jun 27 06:47:52 2015 UTC,"You know what, I love watching him talk about the Oilers, but at this point I really don't think he knows enough about us to be saying anything worthwhile. Whenever journos ask him questions like ""what do you think about the Oilers"", he ends up dishing out a canned line. I'm sure he'll end up researching us throughout the summer, so I'm not worried on that front.  I do truly believe that he was just in shock at that moment (Draft Lottery). Like his dad said, they never expected Oilers to be one of the teams to win the lottery, so his reaction wasn't out of the ordinary."

EdmontonOilers,3b866y,VonIndy,3,Fri Jun 26 20:52:13 2015 UTC,"If a player signs an offer sheet, a team can simply match that offer sheet and take it right then and there.

I'm positive Chiarelli would have offered more than what the Flames paid if he was let in.  McDavid is much better, but he's gravy, we have two great centerman. We need a defenceman like Hamilton to be competitive and there's no guarantee on Nurse being that guy while Hamilton is already there. Hell we could have had Nurse - Hamilton as our top line!  Now Calgary has three franchise defenseman and they already made the playoffs. Any chance of last season being a fluke for them went right out the window.

EdmontonOilers,3b866y,callmenighthawk,1 point,Fri Jun 26 20:12:23 2015 UTC,"I think what I was trying to say was that just because the flamers got Hamilton, it shouldnt ruin today, as we are getting the best player in like 10 years.   Teams are always going to get better players than other teams. It's just how the NHL works. Today is about us. It's about mcdavid. It's about years of futility finally paying off.   Hamilton going to the flamers sucks. Their top 3 d now is probably best in the league. I'm just saying we have nurse coming up. And I think you'll find, in 2 maybe 3 years, nurse will be way ahead of Hamilton in most categories. And we didn't have to give up 3 picks in the first round to get him  Edit: first two rounds"
EdmontonOilers,3b866y,munzi187,1 point,Fri Jun 26 20:18:01 2015 UTC,"No not really although its not out of the question because Nurse has shown that he has a lot more puck talent than a lot of people  initially gave him credit for.    Right now Hamilton is more established.  He's probably better with the puck (although, again I think Nurse has surprised a LOT of people there recently) and he's bigger.  But Nurse has more of an edge and mean streak already.  And he's more physical.  These are attributes this club needs desperately.  I would have swapped Nurse + maybe a 2nd for Dougie but no more.  If Sweeney was asking for Nurse PLUS our 16 AND 33rd then he was smoking the good stuff."

Yak is two years out, Nurse and Drai will get bridges since they will stay in the AHL for at least a year or two. Klefbom will be signed to an extension this july for below market value long term. McDavid is the only concern but that's 3 years out.  Calgary is in a much worse cap situation than us in the short term, them getting Dougie means that they're letting Giordano go which makes them a far worse team."

In 3 years things will be a little different but as far as next year goes their cap space isn't as high as it seems. I know they have more cap space but they have a lot of ridiculously cheap deals expiring after next year and they can't afford to spend to the cap right now or they won't have space to extend their core. Giordano, Monahan, Gaudreau plus a starting goalie are all needed. The only reason this makes sense is if they feel Giordano isn't coming back next year."

EdmontonOilers,3b721x,the_jon_snow,2,Fri Jun 26 18:13:23 2015 UTC,Roy reinvigorated Yak's confidence (and Marco's ceiling suggests a project player). Scrivens and Fasth were traded for late round picks. Purcell had better numbers than Gagner. Paajarvi was turned into Perron who turned into Klinkhammer and 16th overall. How are these not wins?
EdmontonOilers,3b721x,tsn123456789,1 point,Fri Jun 26 18:15:46 2015 UTC,"Because they underperformed where they were supposed to succeed. Scrivens and Fasth have lost us more games than they've won. Purcell has underperformed as a top 6 forward and is trending down, not up. Roy is gone all together.  Perron is gone all together.   The only win I'd consider is Klink so far. Unless Scrivens or Fasth somehow turn into Price next season they're both loses"
EdmontonOilers,3b721x,haterbehatin,2,Fri Jun 26 18:20:24 2015 UTC,"Let's face it, the entire team underperformed. MacT's overall trade record is marked by prospects/picks for small improvement.

EdmontonOilers,3b721x,Loire55,1 point,Fri Jun 26 18:30:16 2015 UTC,"We could have traded for Price, and still lost games. A goalie might save you a few games, but eventually you need to look at the rest of the supporting cast. Edmonton was a -83 goal differential, and one of only 5 teams to not have more than 200 goals on the season. By that stat, one could argue the offence never won us any games and we should trade all of the kids.   Edmonton was also 20th with 30 shots against per game. That is asking a lot from your goalie. In fact, there is not on stat where Edmonton is in the top half of the NHL. Lets face it, Edmonton sucked this year, and its not one player, coaches, GM, trainer, or scouts fault."

EdmontonOilers,3b721x,notsoyoungpadawan,6,Fri Jun 26 14:37:56 2015 UTC,You look at any and all advanced stats on Girardi and he's literally the worst dman they have. And that's straight from a lengthy Rangers fan post.
EdmontonOilers,3b721x,shweet44722,1 point,Fri Jun 26 15:09:43 2015 UTC,Legwand has a similar length contract and we need a right shot d-man. Not to mention the worst Rangers d-man is easily in the oilers top four as it sits.

That #16 could give us close to an elite player if we draft and develop correctly. I cannot stress that enough. That trade would be a perfect example of how a team would throw away its future for a nominal present. We want to win the cup, not just get out of the bottom 5."
EdmontonOilers,3b721x,Whalers7997,3,Fri Jun 26 16:38:04 2015 UTC,Sorry but I'd rather keep that pick and sign niemi if that was the offer on the table.

EdmontonOilers,3b721x,haterbehatin,1 point,Fri Jun 26 14:38:50 2015 UTC,If he truly wants to sign McQuaid going after Eric Gelinas with that pick could make sense.  Klefbom-Schultz or other upgrade  Gelinas-McQuaid   Marincin- Fayne  I don't really want McQuaid but he makes a target like Gelinas make more sense to me adds a guy with some offense and offensive upside.
EdmontonOilers,3b721x,notsoyoungpadawan,2,Fri Jun 26 14:58:04 2015 UTC,How about Gelinas and Matteau plus Florida's 2nd for Yaks?
EdmontonOilers,3b721x,haterbehatin,1 point,Fri Jun 26 16:06:17 2015 UTC,I'm not sure if Chiarelli would make that kind of move or not.  I don't really like it because we haven't really seen the best of Yakupov yet and right wing depth in the organization is really thin although Miller might be able to stick. The free agent market is also shit unless you want to overpay for a Ward or Williams.
EdmontonOilers,3b721x,notsoyoungpadawan,2,Fri Jun 26 16:11:58 2015 UTC,You still want Schultz in the top pairing?
EdmontonOilers,3b721x,haterbehatin,1 point,Fri Jun 26 16:34:40 2015 UTC,If the guys brought in were McQuaid and Gelinas then yes.
EdmontonOilers,3b721x,notsoyoungpadawan,2,Fri Jun 26 16:39:04 2015 UTC,And you'd have Schultz ahead of Fayne?
EdmontonOilers,3b721x,Andy-Martin,1 point,Fri Jun 26 17:14:24 2015 UTC,"It's because of the combinations.   Klefbom is a steady guy with some offense, Fayne is a steady guy without much offense.  It's not necessarily a reflection of minutes, just combinations.  Schultz played better with Fayne, Gelinas is an offensive guy needing a defensive partner, Fayne is a shutdown guy and plays well with Marincin."
EdmontonOilers,3b721x,haterbehatin,1 point,Fri Jun 26 17:24:05 2015 UTC,But our top priority with defence is stability and reliableness. Putting Schultz back on the top defensive pairing where he has failed so miserably during the last season will only ensure further damage. I don't see him improving defensively from last season because he isn't a player who likes to commit when defending.
EdmontonOilers,3b721x,PM_ME_UR_SECRET,1 point,Fri Jun 26 18:22:18 2015 UTC,"So who goes on the top pairing? McQuaid? Fayne.  Again you're getting stuck on the ""top pairing"" unless the Oilers get a big upgrade on defense again they're not really going to have a top pairing.  Klefbom and Schultz played well together, at least Schultz played better with Klefbom.    If that group I posted was the group they had I think they'd be the best option.  Ference likely plays and Ference and Schultz was a complete gong show because Schultz gets lost and Ference is a pylon.   They don't have a Pronger or a Chara or a Keith who can eat the big minutes."
EdmontonOilers,3b721x,Frostdavid,2,Fri Jun 26 19:16:07 2015 UTC,"I would still give Fayne higher minutes before I do Schultz. I also feel that playing Klefbom with Schultz for another season could really hamper his development, especially offensively. He has the potential to be a 30-40 point D-man."
EdmontonOilers,3b721x,Ebs14,2,Fri Jun 26 22:18:34 2015 UTC,No way I want Jultz anywhere near the top pairing.

EdmontonOilers,3b7eou,notsoyoungpadawan,2,Fri Jun 26 16:49:01 2015 UTC,The more I observe Tim Murray in Buffalo the more I begin to think that he is an actual moron. He treats his team and the sport like he's playing a game of Hockey Manager 2015 (see: Football Manager 2015).
EdmontonOilers,3b7eou,shweet44722,1 point,Fri Jun 26 16:54:59 2015 UTC,"We'll see if it pans out. He's made some interesting moves but appears to be in the ""offense and only offense wins games"" mindset. Which, if he wants advice, I'd recommend avoiding unless you're team is Tampa. He better acquire some defenceman or they'll be in mot much different of a position come next season."
EdmontonOilers,3b7eou,notsoyoungpadawan,2,Fri Jun 26 17:07:23 2015 UTC,"I mean, he humiliated himself and the Sabres by tanking, then by throwing a hissy fit in the media - granted the media sympathized with him but it was still a dick move - then throws Eichel under the bus by leaking his ""I'm the best player in this draft"" comment.. Now despite the fact that the have enough prospects and probably don't need the 21st pick, he's pulls a bad trade out of the hat.   I don't know. I can really see him throwing around some crazy offers for other players during free agency, especially since Sabres have a lot of cap space. I also won't rule out him deciding to tank for a second time next season if they aren't where he wants them to be in 6 months."

And they still need a backup...Sabres may have some prospects and some offensive talent, but that's not a recipe for success (where have we seen that formula before)."
EdmontonOilers,3b7eou,shweet44722,2,Fri Jun 26 17:40:56 2015 UTC,"Yeah I thought Lehner wold go for quite a bit less and the Sabres took a cap dump too which really makes it interesting, unless TM just really liked Legwand?"
EdmontonOilers,3b7eou,shweet44722,2,Fri Jun 26 17:26:37 2015 UTC,"Yeah as did I, didn't think any goalie would get a 1st without solid sweeteners alongside. Lol he must, which if so I'm confused as to why. Legwand was like an anchor this year. Just filled up space and skated about as fast as one too."
EdmontonOilers,3b7eou,shweet44722,1 point,Fri Jun 26 17:32:24 2015 UTC,They just did a deal. Wait maybe not I just saw it pop up Martin Jones to the Oilers and then it disappeared.

EdmontonOilers,3b676q,envague,7,Fri Jun 26 08:16:57 2015 UTC,My day today will consist of a journey across Scotland heading home so I won't be able to keep up with stuff going on today but god damn I'm excited!  Any reminder of how lucky we are has had me smiling for weeks. I saw a dude in a (surprisingly beautiful) Colorado jersey the other day and I felt wonderful just thinking of the seasons ahead.  Actually looking at time difference I will be in Edinburgh by your  midday and home about an hour after so I guess I won't miss too much I guess.
EdmontonOilers,3b676q,KingDave46,10,Fri Jun 26 10:32:04 2015 UTC,"As a heads up for those who haven't heard, and who want to avoid SN like the plague (I know I do), the TSN hockey crew will be on NBC for the draft. I don't know about y'all, but I'd much rather watch Duthie and the boys than Kypreos, Stock and the sad sack of shit that is Healy.  Just gotta say, it's been ~2.5 years since I've been in this sub, and while I have no doubt in my mind that the thread is going to be a shitshow when everyone comes storming in, I'm excited to be able to experience what will surely be one of the best moments in recent franchise history after having gone through some of the worst with many of you.  I think we're gonna be okay, folks. Oh, and for anyone who tries to shoot us down today? Just remember to upvote, and throw some of  these their way.  Edit2: My NBC station in Ottawa is playing Jeopardy and Wheel of Fortune instead of the Draft. May want to check your TVs to be sure, but I may actually have to resort to watching SN, if not a stream."
EdmontonOilers,3b676q,shweet44722,2,Fri Jun 26 09:17:23 2015 UTC,I'll be watching online.Will TSN.ca be broadcasting it live there? or is there a better site to head to?
EdmontonOilers,3b676q,arcticcatherder,4,Fri Jun 26 16:49:14 2015 UTC,"Think NHL.com will have it live. TSN may not, but even if they do, their usual crew won't be there. Don't think they got broadcast rights this year though, so it's likely NHLN, NBCN and SN.  If you're okay with using a streaming site, it appears blabseal will be streaming the event. That site always has HD, no lag streams for games, it's how I watched a good number of the playoff games while on campus this year. Otherwise, maybe try NHLN or NBCN's site, and if they have a country requirement I'd recommend Zenmate for a VPN."

This is shaping up to be that.  Either cgy signs Hamilton or they get at least a 1st, 2nd and 3rd from the offer sheet and it's pretty much a wash."

I mean correlation doesn't necessarily mean causation but if the p value is high low enough.....in this case, I don't think it's an overly wild speculation to say that Chia may not have had his say in a good number of the deals done during his time there."

EdmontonOilers,3b4pcg,shweet44722,2,Thu Jun 25 23:56:19 2015 UTC,"I think its 4 coaches total, Head coach, Associate coach, and 2 Assistant coaches. I think Kreuger only had Buchburger, and Smith, and he was short only one coach, or am I wrong?"
EdmontonOilers,3b4pcg,9Bains,2,Fri Jun 26 01:53:20 2015 UTC,"I don't remember under Kreuger, but apparently it varies per team.  Some teams choose 1, 2 or 3 assistant coaches, some choose 2 and a goalie coach, some have 1 and a goalie consultant...so for all we know TMac and Chia could go with Rocky, Jay and Jim, fire Rocky or hire Paulrus as an extra...  Edit: Well Paulrus appears to be signing with Anaheim as an AC, so Todd McLellan, Jay Woodcroft, Rocky Thompson and Jim Johnson appear to be our coaches for this season."

EdmontonOilers,3b4pcg,shweet44722,3,Thu Jun 25 23:30:20 2015 UTC,It sounds like Johnson is for developing Defence. I'm concerned about goal coaching (see what a good coach did for Dubs).
EdmontonOilers,3b4pcg,IGetComputersPuting,9,Thu Jun 25 23:39:00 2015 UTC,"Well we have Schwartz at the moment, he's only been on staff for a little bit. But there's also Burke in Arizona, who's a legend in the goalie coaching world, reportedly talking to teams. Never know where he may end up."
EdmontonOilers,3b4pcg,shweet44722,5,Thu Jun 25 23:58:10 2015 UTC,"Doesn't Burke want like a GM job now? that's what I remember a few weeks ago, which would make sense as to why he hasn't been picked up by anyone."
EdmontonOilers,3b4pcg,arcticcatherder,2,Fri Jun 26 01:34:25 2015 UTC,"Hmm, you may be right. I completely forgot about that."
EdmontonOilers,3b4pcg,shweet44722,3,Fri Jun 26 01:39:46 2015 UTC,"Oh right@ Schwartz... was he the UofA guy? He wasn't pro, right? I think he was big on some of the technology that some of the pro's use, so that was a plus. I don't know how he compares though. Would potentially like a really strong goalie coach with a proven history."
EdmontonOilers,3b4pcg,arcticcatherder,3,Fri Jun 26 00:11:54 2015 UTC,"According to the Edmonton Sun (blech, I know), he was teaching part time at Vimy Ridge Academy and a part-time goalie coach with the Oil Kings. Used to play for the U of A I think, and worked with Brossoit when he was with the Oil Kings. Whether or not he's made a difference is debatable, although the goalies did improve slightly under Nelson, but he hasn't had a lot of time to work with them and is still an unproven goalie coach. I wouldn't be surprised if Chia shops for another one, simply, like you said, to find a proven, strong goalie coach.  Burke would be fantastic. He's a god damn goalie Wizard, but whether he comes here or not is up in there air, and I honestly haven't seen any rumours about him since the report came out about him being given permission to talk to other teams."
EdmontonOilers,3b4pcg,shweet44722,2,Fri Jun 26 00:16:51 2015 UTC,"Oh man, one can hope, right? Burke worked with Dubs, didn't he? If he did, I would REALLY love it if they could convince the guy to work here."
EdmontonOilers,3b4pcg,HarfNarfArf,2,Fri Jun 26 02:42:59 2015 UTC,"He did, but /u/igetcomputersputing made good point that I completely forgot about. Burke seems to want to be in a management position, like GM/AGM kind of role, rather than a goalie coach. Since all of those positions are kind of filled....yeah. Unless he wants to coach again but for another team, which you never know but seems unlikely, it doesn't seem like he'll come here.  But then again, a lot has changed as of late. Anything seems like a possibility nowadays."
EdmontonOilers,3b4pcg,TweetPoster,3,Fri Jun 26 02:48:37 2015 UTC,"From what I remember, TMac either said right after we hired him that Jay would come with him, or, he said after leaving the Sharks (before joining Edmonton) that Jay would follow him wherever.

EdmontonOilers,3b5ljp,shweet44722,2,Fri Jun 26 05:39:17 2015 UTC,Might be to just talk about the coaches they just hired along with a short rundown of the draft plan.

EdmontonOilers,3b5ljp,silverlegend,1 point,Fri Jun 26 04:11:36 2015 UTC,"Would anyone be that upset if the pick was traded for a kings ransom, similar to the haul for the Lindros deal?  Say if The Leafs (as an example) made a Lindros pitch for it that included the #4, Rielly, Kadri, Komorov, Percy, Bernier, Polak and their 2016 and 2017 firsts...would that be something that should be summarily dismissed? I don't know."
EdmontonOilers,3b5ljp,silverlegend,2,Fri Jun 26 12:28:16 2015 UTC,That kind of deal is simply impossible in a salary cap era. No way could any team afford to add that many players without even giving up any contracts.

My dad, brother and I were all sat down by the tv with beers, waiting for the rest of my family to show up for dinner.  As the draft got to the top 5 and closer to Toronto I started to get nervous, to the point where I had to close my eyes for their pick (I really really hate the leafs) the relief after that pick flooded my body, and I really didn't even entertain the idea that we could possibly win. So when Bill pulled that next card, and had that shit eating grin on his face before he said we have a winner, I said no fucking way. Looked over to my dad, leapt up and started yelling we got MCDAVID WHEUUUUU.  We then all proceeded directly to the liquor cabinet to pour out some expensive rye and celly hard! Best part was my uncle showing up a half hour later (Habs fan eww), and when we told him we won he got so fucking mad, he said the draft was fixed and they should do a re-draft hahaha"

A small crowd gathered around me and one of my friends said it would be totally hilarious if we won it because all of the other teams would be so pissed off at us. As soon as I saw Toronto pull the 4th pick I was like ""Sweet, we get Hanafin!"" I was not expecting us to win at all.

They don't have TV so I couldn't watch it live, but I was planning on following it on Twitter.  However I fell asleep on the sofa, and when I woke up I had a bunch of texts screaming that we got McDavid.  I wondered if they were being cruelly sarcastic, or if I was dreaming, life couldn't possibly be this sweet.  If I'm dreaming I hope to never wake up.  Tomorrow I'll be watching the draft with my best friend from highschool.  We watched countless games in his parents' basement, including Marchant's OT series-clinching goal against the hated Stars.  Years later we hung a poster of the Sedins on the wall, and every time the Oilers would score we would pour beer on their ugly faces and dance to Herbie Hancock's ""Rock It"", except when the song went ""Oh rock it"" we would instead sing ""Rem Murray"".  And now I'm crying."

For some reason my friend and I thought they were just announcing the teams involved and would announce the winner after all the positions had been established. Well, we turned the TV to mute and put on highlights of Provorov and that Dergachoyov (I don't think I'm spelling that right, but it's the Russian guy Nurse battled in that famous clip) on his phone. Anyways, we look up after and see the golden Oilers card and we say, ""ha ha NHL, good one. Play a joke on us and do the real draft afterward."" We then turn on the sound after seeing it's not changing and everyone's saying, ""McDavid to Edmonton."" And they are interviewing him; and I think we sat there for a good fifteen minutes listening in disbelief, just asking over and over, ""did we actually get McDavid?"" Before we jumped up and laughed. It was glorious! We'll be doing the same thing tomorrow. He's going to be a bit late but I think we know what's happening at #1, I think he just wants to be here for the #16."

I wanted to pretend as though I actually watched it so I went on Reddit before I answered the texts.

It got down to Toronto and my heart started beating faster; they lost too and I muttered 'thank christ' or something to that effect.  Then they said 'we have a winner', I rose in my seat and said 'oh my fucking god', they flipped over that gold card and we both stood up and shouted 'YES!!! HOLY SHIT WE GOT MCDAVID!' and hugged each other and shouted for a good minute.  After telling my mum why we were shouting like madmen I walked around the house in a stupor for five or ten minutes while talking to my dad, then came back to my PC and started talking about it everywhere.    I'm going to be doing the same thing tomorrow too. It'd be sweet to hang out with the subreddit squad at a bar or something but my dad and I have talked about the Oilers excitedly for weeks straight for pretty much the first time in my life since the Hall draft."

When the gold card flipped over I was confused at first, until I saw Edmonton slide up to first in the graphics package. I lost my shit, started dancing and spinning around on the hardwood while screaming. It took me over a week not to laugh out loud whenever I thought of that moment.   Now, I'm out in the Okanagan for a family thing, typing this by the side of the pool in the shade of a mountain.

So I had the draft on for 2 reasons, the main one was to make sure we didn't lose our spot in the draft and lose Hanafin, and background noise while I talked online to someone.   At the start I honestly didn't really care, but as the draft went on I got more anxious and anxious. For a second I even thought those goddamn Leafs were going to get Mcdavid, and I was like fuck life!!! but thankfully that passed. So we finally got to us, and at that moment I was totally content we just didn't get bumped down a spot yet still didn't think we could win in million tries. (Hell, I even zoned out for bit).  This is burned into my memory, I remember Daly looking over at his side and after pausing a bit longer than he did for everybody else. I knew then some shit was up right there, but I still wouldn't let my self believe. ""And we have a winner"", I sat there in disbelief for a solid minute or two staring at the gold card, and straight up just burst out laughing.  Then my laughter turned to celebration, then I started doing both, then I started drinking, then I remembered I had to text and call everyone and also rub it in everyone's face who wasn't an oiler fan irl or even online for all the shit we had to put up with. I don't think I've ever shitposted that much in my whole life.  I still enjoy the hate like 2 months later, and I always will. I'm 100% sure its all thanks to Swizzy too!!!"

Similar to a lot of posts here, when Daley opened up the Oilers envelope I said ""No fucking way"" either in anticipation of seeing the golden ticket, or maybe something about his mannerisms tipped me off, I don't know. But we won, and I shouted with joy, kissed my girlfriend, told her how good of a player we just got, then ran upstairs to tell my brother we had won the lottery - he was too busy playing Destiny."

If I wasn't nervous it was only because I honestly didn't think we would win. I was just hoping that a team I hated, like Philly or Toronto, wouldn't come out on top.  As the other teams were getting eliminated, I oddly became more and more relaxed. After Toronto got fourth, I quietly went ""oh shit"" and suddenly all that tension and nervous energy I was probably repressing just hit me in one giant wave.   When it came to the Oilers in the 3rd position and Bill Daly said ""We have a winner"", I kind of blanked, I just robotically input ""1st"" in the title of the thread and hit the submit button. Immediately after I just fucking screamed. I ran around the apartment and yelled out the window ""YEEEEEEEAAAAAAAAHHHH MCDAAAAAAAVIIIIIID"".  I lifted my gf up the floor and then called one of my best friends from Edmonton who I knew was on a drive up to Whistler and missed the lottery. I screamed into the phone ""WE WON! WE FUCKING WON! WE GOT MCDAVID!"" and had the pleasure of giving him the news.   After much hooting and hollering I sat back down, posted a SWIZZY in the thread, and breathed in a giant gasp of air, after which my gf looked over at me and said ""Your life isn't going to be the same.""  I'm watching the draft with a couple Edmonton friends tomorrow. For the past long while I've been following a personal rule which dictates that I won't allow myself to drink before 6pm. I am exempting myself from the prohibition tomorrow afternoon. The plan is nothing less than to get Gucci Mane wasted."

And Tomorrow since I'm under medical orders not to drink (and the fact how I'm only 17) I'll be drinking some Coke if I can be bothered getting some whilst watching the draft and if I can't be bothered I'll be drinking some Ginger beer.

It felt like he suffering from the past 9 years was worthwhile. And the good news just kept coming after that.  As I live in Vancouver I will be down at the Black Frog in Gastown. It's rain city's Oilers bar and I will be drinking happy pints!
EdmontonOilers,3b312g,FreakPirate,1 point,Thu Jun 25 20:29:32 2015 UTC,"Had totally planned on watching the Draft coverage. Got busy, completely forgot because I am an idiot and was starving. Had just sat down with a couple people to eat when one of their phones had a notification sound. They looked at it. Went white with the look of shock and mouthed something about the Oilers won the lottery. I swear all of us screamed in unison ""ARE YOU FUCKING SERIOUS"" in disbelief, gabbed out phones to search for the draft, and one ran straight for the TV to find any sports channel that may possibly be covering it. No one believed it until we stared mindless with open mouths at the TV while they were discussing it. Then, of course, maniacal laughter. Not one of us was remotely anticipating winning this draft. We had resigned ourselves it was not us and all we hoped for was it wasn't the Leafs or the Kings. We actually never even wanted to look up McDavid to be disappointed more and only looked up the guys who ranked 3-8.  As for the actual draft tomorrow... I am working, but if it's not too busy, I'll be streaming it with no sound in the background on my computer. LOL I won't forget this time. But damn, I was still sort of pissed I missed the build up of the actual draft lottery that day. I ended up trying to locate the countdown video to at least try to recreate the moment and suspense. It's not the same but I got entertainment watching all the home made videos of other teams' fans getting all salty."

I'm working tomorrow but I'll be spending most of the day on my phone getting updates"

When I saw the gold Oilers card, followed by our pick rocketing up to #1, I literally jumped from my seat with my hand in the air.  About 3 seconds later some random dude stands up and yells ""I'm an Oilers fan too!"" and runs towards me. I went for the hand out bro-hug and he hugged me like there was no tomorrow. It was kind of awkward seeing as I didn't know him and the whole restaurant saw but it was also funny."

Then we walked to the eaton center and ate at Jack astors , still high from the win. We went back to the hotel , I had the tv on not expecting to see the oilers to get better than third.  one thing led to another and I was balls deep in my wife, when tsn said ""this just in the oilers have one the draft"".

EdmontonOilers,3b3pr0,dacanadian,25,Thu Jun 25 18:41:07 2015 UTC,Darnell Nurse   Are you nuts? Thats literally our future you're selling
EdmontonOilers,3b3pr0,plahcinski,15,Thu Jun 25 18:52:38 2015 UTC,Klef too. Giving away 2 young defenders and a low pick in a deep draft... Nah...
EdmontonOilers,3b3pr0,OdinPBH,13,Thu Jun 25 19:00:52 2015 UTC,"I don't think my heart could take us being fleeced for Darnell nurse, Klefbom, and the 16th. Maybe if Hamilton was signed for 8 years at 2 million a year I'd consider that trade."
EdmontonOilers,3b3pr0,ClintonsDix,6,Thu Jun 25 19:48:57 2015 UTC,That would be an overpayment of an asset that doesn't have a contract. We would be trading for the exclusive right to negotiate with him until July 1.
EdmontonOilers,3b3pr0,azure_888,2,Thu Jun 25 19:27:28 2015 UTC,"Jesus...at the expense of every single decent D prospect. No friggin way. I might give up Klefbom + Picks + b prospects but no way I give up Nurse.    I'm also against trading Dr Drai. We're going to need some ""cheaper"" forwards in the future. Honestly...Klefbom (who's top 4 potential) + #16 pick + next years first rounder is probably the most id give up...maybe a shitty B level prospect as well.   It's not enough to get Dougie though. But I'm not willing to gut for him...especially our D prospects."
EdmontonOilers,3b3pr0,Scottishstalion,4,Thu Jun 25 19:03:00 2015 UTC,"If he agrees to sign with us at something like 6x8 I'd give up a first and Marincin. You don't move anything valuable for a guy without a contract, another team can easily come in and offer sheet him and we're in a worse position than we started with."
EdmontonOilers,3b3pr0,tsn123456789,2,Thu Jun 25 19:58:33 2015 UTC,"I would try Marincin, 16th, a 2nd, Schultz, Purcell with retained salary I'm sure thats not enough but who knows."
EdmontonOilers,3b3pr0,Eyo27,2,Thu Jun 25 19:23:27 2015 UTC,"To be blunt those deals are terrible for the oilers. you could argue Draisaitl being a bit of a luxury makes him a better fit, but if it was him, it would be him, and the 16th, or him Marincin and a second. If they traded our best roster defenseman and best defensive prospect for a single defender it better be a guy who was nominated for an award last night.   Part of Boston's downfall this year was Hamilton being shoved in to the number one slot, when Chara wasn't there. He looks poised to become that guy, but he's not that guy yet. Nurse is the guy you want beside Hamilton in a couple years, and Klefbom the guy you put beside him right now: you can't give away both to get him."
EdmontonOilers,3b3pr0,A5hcrack,3,Thu Jun 25 20:14:38 2015 UTC,"I'm not giving away Klefbom or Nurse. I'm pretty sure that Marincin played with Chara at the Olympics. They might have interest there. I'd try and sell them on the 16th + Marincin + 2nd rounder in 2016. I think that might do it, but I'd be willing to go up on that last piece. Maybe Schultz instead of the 2nd rounder. If they wanted to up it to a 1st rounder, I'd try and come back with making it in 2017 or 18."
EdmontonOilers,3b3pr0,El_reverso,3,Thu Jun 25 19:16:14 2015 UTC,An offer sheet. Fuck giving them value
EdmontonOilers,3b3pr0,RedOilSaints,0,Thu Jun 25 20:12:32 2015 UTC,Nurse would be a non starter.    Playing armchair GM: Klefbom OR Draisaitl + the 16th + some other depth peices would be about where i would be comfortable at.

He said he felt hurt when he left, he was really invested here, started a family and had a house, and management threw him under a bus and out the door, so I wouldn't be at all surprised if he didn't want to come back. That may be different with the change in management, but I'd imagine that Dubnyk is going to want to get paid, and paying $5M for Dubnyk when it's a buyers market for goaltenders doesn't seem wholly necessary at the moment."
EdmontonOilers,3b0nje,shweet44722,4,Thu Jun 25 01:43:04 2015 UTC,"and management threw him under a bus and out the door, so I wouldn't be at all surprised if he didn't want to come back.   What if we hung a sign up outside the door that said ""Under New Management"" ?"
EdmontonOilers,3b0nje,learn2die101,1 point,Thu Jun 25 05:21:34 2015 UTC,"I mean....ya never know.  Although MacT is still with the organization, albeit under an unknown role.

EdmontonOilers,3b0nje,shweet44722,1 point,Thu Jun 25 05:57:46 2015 UTC,Things we had to do for McDavid
EdmontonOilers,3b0nje,greenbasterd,8,Thu Jun 25 15:43:52 2015 UTC,"Personally I don't want anything to do with Dubnyk. He went back to his career levels that he was at in Edmonton with Arizona and then spiked with the Wild.   I would be very surprised if he doesn't regress.   I think there are many options available that can bring roughly what he brought at his peak in Edmonton and hopefully more consistently, time for everyone to move on.   Good for him that he did so well this year, hopefully he keeps it up but if he doesn't I don't see why any team wants to be the one giving him 5x5 or whatever he's looking for. That's Jimmy Howard level pay and production and I don't want anything to do with Jimmy Howard either."
EdmontonOilers,3b0nje,haterbehatin,2,Thu Jun 25 03:21:09 2015 UTC,"Yep. Good on him for righting the ship; I have no problem giving someone credit for their achievements, and if you're gonna do that, you can blame them for their stumbles too. But the situation was messy. It's like if your ex went crazy when you were together, you both move on, they fix up their life and become a better person, and you start to think ""maybe we should get back together...?"" Yeah it could work, but if it went wrong again, it will look twice as bad this time, because people will assume there's something toxic about one, the other, or both parties."
EdmontonOilers,3b0nje,LevSmash,6,Thu Jun 25 16:24:55 2015 UTC,"We might have a small chance of getting Dubnyk back because of the new management and McDavid, but I doubt it. I assumed Niemi was our primary target if we didn't trade for a goalie before the draft."
EdmontonOilers,3b0nje,ClintonsDix,7,Thu Jun 25 01:23:53 2015 UTC,Nah don't want Dubnyk back. MIN goes through a different goalie every season and statistically he's due to regression plus he wants a long term deal.
EdmontonOilers,3b0nje,tsn123456789,3,Thu Jun 25 05:08:08 2015 UTC,MIN goes through a different goalie every season   And we don't?  We go though a new coach every season too.
EdmontonOilers,3b0nje,learn2die101,1 point,Thu Jun 25 05:22:28 2015 UTC,I don't really get what your point is. I'm just pointing out that ever year a different goalie steps up for MIN.
EdmontonOilers,3b0nje,tsn123456789,2,Thu Jun 25 15:54:02 2015 UTC,No way Dubnyk comes back. MacT is still part of the organization.

Hell, even if it isn't like that one I'll probably still be happy cause I'm a fan of orange jerseys.  I wonder if this is just to capitalize on McDavid jersey sales.

I hope they keep it classic and make it look exactly like our current home jerseys, with the Blue and Orange switched.  Also, I'm really glad Chia is handling things like he is. That 16th pick is valuable and he knows that. He's also taking his time because he knows the Goalie market right now is over saturated and the Rangers and Sens will have to settle for less than they want. If we can wait Vancouver out and bring Lack to Edmonton with a couple of picks I'd be really happy."
EdmontonOilers,3aydzd,envague,5,Wed Jun 24 14:49:38 2015 UTC,"Does anybody really think this is anything more than a cash grab?  ""Our fan base is excited right now.  How we can use this to take more of their money? """
EdmontonOilers,3aydzd,nuttybuddy,18,Wed Jun 24 16:02:19 2015 UTC,The very concept of a 3rd jersey is because it's a cash grab.

""How do I take advantage of an eager market?"" is definitely the thought process on 90% of all decisions made by teams. Oilers organization won't have to worry too much about it though I think, they'll be swimming in ticket and merchandise sales for the next 7+ years with McDavid coming to town. And if the team starts winning again? Even more so."
EdmontonOilers,3aydzd,gum-,1 point,Wed Jun 24 17:45:33 2015 UTC,"I get that it's a business. What bugs me is they try to have it both ways.    We  are supposed to support the team out of civic pride and all that other crap, & we are supposed to pretend phrases like 'maximizing revenue streams "" don't mean 'taking our loyal fans for every dollar we can get'.  I love the hockey side, but the business side is sleazy, imo, and the more I learn, the more frustrated I get."
EdmontonOilers,3aydzd,KeesVanLoo-Macklin,4,Wed Jun 24 18:22:20 2015 UTC,No one is forcing you into the mall to buy one.

EdmontonOilers,3aydzd,KeesVanLoo-Macklin,3,Wed Jun 24 20:47:12 2015 UTC,"Well, I mean that's any pro sport. They have ads so they can make money, they sell streaming services so they can cash in on away fans, they increase ticket prices when interest goes up, and will have sales when interest peaks. At the end of the day, hockey is still an entertainment industry.  I mean it feels bad to get fucked in the ass by high ticket prices that only increase as a team gets better, but you're also paying for quality of product. It's like with the cup finals, how the prices get jacked up to $1000+ for standing room only tickets because there's just so many people clamoring to get them.  From a business standpoint, it'd be incredibly stupid not to make money of that venture. It's like a lemonade stand on a hot day. You may decrease your prices a bit to raise interest, but at the end of the day you're still going to try to maintain solid profit margins.  It's a little sleazy, and at the end of the day the person who benefits most from the team being good is Katz, but that's part of the entertainment industry. The little fish get to enjoy the show while the big fish get the cash."
EdmontonOilers,3aydzd,shweet44722,1 point,Wed Jun 24 18:27:15 2015 UTC,"Again, I understand how business works.   What I hate is for-profit businesses masquerading as part of the public good ie supporting the Oilers is part of being a 'true'  or 'real'  Edmonite.  To me, it's similar to Tim Hortons, the foreign owned chain, pretending to be the ultimate in Canadiana. This practice works, but it is sleazy, and difficult to support, imo.   If someone likes the Oilers or shitty coffee, great, but don't try to make it more than that."

EdmontonOilers,3aw3ie,RightOnEh,14,Wed Jun 24 00:16:38 2015 UTC,Sekera would be a fantastic pickup IMO.  I'd take Oduya too if he doesn't demand an exorbitantly high pay day.
EdmontonOilers,3aw3ie,shweet44722,2,Wed Jun 24 00:27:57 2015 UTC,"I feel like his market price will be around $5mil, which I wouldn't be comfortable with."
EdmontonOilers,3aw3ie,anderhyo,2,Wed Jun 24 04:59:56 2015 UTC,"Well he was a .668 cap hit with the Kings, and made 2.75M/AAV with the Sabres and Canes. I have to imagine he'd demand more, he's 29 with 8 years of experience and still a useful defenceman, but I can't see him getting 5M to be honest. Maybe 4-4.5, but not 5. Whether he's worth that much to us is debatable, but that's not at terrible price for a solid defenceman."
EdmontonOilers,3aw3ie,shweet44722,4,Wed Jun 24 05:08:19 2015 UTC,"I'd be shocked if he signed for less than $5mil. If we sign him as part of a revamped blueline where he wont be playing on the top pair and we utilize him in his role as a solid depth guy, then I absolutely agree with you. If we sign him and we go into October with Schultz and Sekera as our 1 and 2, then we're in big trouble."
EdmontonOilers,3aw3ie,anderhyo,1 point,Wed Jun 24 05:18:41 2015 UTC,"Oh god no. If we pick up Sekera I hope Chia is still hunting defenceman. He'd be a good edition, but certainly shouldn't be the end all, be all for this offseason."
EdmontonOilers,3aw3ie,shweet44722,2,Wed Jun 24 05:27:30 2015 UTC,It's a sellers market. With Petry getting 5.5 AAV I can't see Sekera getting less than 5.

EdmontonOilers,3aw3ie,IGOR_ULANOV_55_BEST,2,Wed Jun 24 05:30:28 2015 UTC,"Shit I forgot about his 5.5. In fairness, that deal was exorbitant and even shocked a lot of the analysts Although it worked out well for the Caps this season, Orpik played well."
EdmontonOilers,3aw3ie,shweet44722,30,Wed Jun 24 05:32:02 2015 UTC,Lets sign this Dubnyk guy.
EdmontonOilers,3aw3ie,Vlykeron,6,Tue Jun 23 23:56:30 2015 UTC,In all seriousness though I would love to have Dubnyk back...
EdmontonOilers,3aw3ie,learn2die101,3,Wed Jun 24 01:08:34 2015 UTC,I wouldn't   For the Oilers sake and for his own. He needs to be somewhere else
EdmontonOilers,3aw3ie,WooTs_67,0,Wed Jun 24 14:35:50 2015 UTC,He floundered behind our D and cost us more games than he won. Do you really want him back if we're gonna get a (more than likely) regressing Dubnyk?
EdmontonOilers,3aw3ie,B0mb-Hands,2,Thu Jun 25 00:22:58 2015 UTC,"He's developed techniques which he did not have here under arguably the best goalie coach on earth, left that organization and then only got better. He changed his game so much that he's a Vezina candidate. Even if he regressed to an average goalie that's still much better than what we have now and what he had when we had him before."
EdmontonOilers,3aw3ie,learn2die101,2,Thu Jun 25 00:37:34 2015 UTC,He was average when we had him before and look what we got. One good season is not worth it
EdmontonOilers,3aw3ie,B0mb-Hands,2,Thu Jun 25 00:40:48 2015 UTC,I think we're just going to have to agree to disagree on this one.
EdmontonOilers,3aw3ie,learn2die101,8,Thu Jun 25 00:49:41 2015 UTC,"Andrej Sekera is the highest ranked player I'd want from the list, others include Oduya, Ramo (if we don't trade for a goalie, or trade away Scrivens) Ehrhoff is interesting, as is Chris Stewart. On a 2-3 year deal maybe Michalek."
EdmontonOilers,3aw3ie,9Bains,6,Wed Jun 24 01:18:09 2015 UTC,"One name that isn't tossed around that often is Curtis Glencross. He'd solidify us down the LW, really compliment the third line. Could be great with Ladner"
EdmontonOilers,3aw3ie,Ebs14,2,Wed Jun 24 12:54:09 2015 UTC,Plus itd be nice to have flames talent coming this way instead of vice versa
EdmontonOilers,3aw3ie,omguard,4,Fri Jun 26 01:55:58 2015 UTC,Ramo and Franson. They're the only ones young enough and good enough to make any difference to us in year 4 and 5 of the deals they'll want.
EdmontonOilers,3aw3ie,wallsallbrassbuttons,3,Wed Jun 24 04:18:38 2015 UTC,"Mike Green and Mark Letestu. Sweet baby Jesus that would be a great offseason. Both players are criminally underrated, and I think they're the best fits out there for our needs at 1D and 3C (shift Lander to 3LW) there are.    If you don't agree with me, ask for an explanation before down voting. I think those two would go a LONG ways towards turning this team around.    And yes, I realize Letestu isn't on the list, which is criminal. Or awesome, if you're the team signing him."
EdmontonOilers,3aw3ie,haterbehatin,1 point,Wed Jun 24 05:02:30 2015 UTC,"I thought about Letestu, I don't see the wisdom of moving a defensively reliable centre who is good at faceoffs out of the position though.   Now if Letestu can play right wing that would make him a lot more appealing in my view.   Mike Green is a tough one if he's getting a big money deal with a lot of term he's not worth it in my opinion now if he gets a big AAV and it's for 2 years I could see him making sense.   But if he's getting a Phaneuf like contract and I've seen some speculate he might but I have no idea if he will, Chiarelli needs to stay the fuck away from him particularly with his injury history."
EdmontonOilers,3aw3ie,wallsallbrassbuttons,2,Wed Jun 24 05:19:35 2015 UTC,"Letestu is another defensively reliable center who is good at face-offs. Been one of CBJ's top face-off guys for years, and he takes a ton of them too. Would even the lineup at 2 RHC and 2LHC with Lander able to slide in in case of injury. On top of that, previous to this year, Letestu had 3 years in a row of near-0.5PPG production while getting 4th line minutes and huge penalty kill minutes. He's a gritty bugger too. Versatile, relatively cheap, and would work great with Lander on a line.    As for Mike Green, he's had two years in his career where he hasn't played top pairing minutes and come out on top, a year in which he was injured and played 3D minutes, and this year, after the Caps added Niskanen and Orpik. Even then, he put up 45 points in #5D minutes. He's twice been a Norris finalist. Has led the playoffs-making Caps in ice time more times than he hasn't, and has been a 1D on a Presidents Trophy winning team. He's young enough that he has 4-5 years of excellent play left, he's from Alberta, and for a team badly lacking offensive production, his presence at the point would be a godsend.    He's good defensively too, which is the crazy part. Only once in his career has he not had positive possession stats, despite having a career 48% OZS (i.e. he starts in the defensive end more than the offensive end - not what his reputation says). Mike Green is a fantastic defenseman. The fact that we could get him for only money is incredibly exciting."
EdmontonOilers,3aw3ie,darkstar107,1 point,Wed Jun 24 15:33:46 2015 UTC,I would love for Mike Green to join the team.  I think that there's going to be a lot of teams in on him though and am scared about what we'd have to pay him to come here.
EdmontonOilers,3aw3ie,learn2die101,6,Thu Jun 25 15:35:03 2015 UTC,"Cody Franson and Mike Green are standouts. Wouldn't mind a guy like Mike Fisher for a veteran depth guy. Lots of other good Dman that would be definite upgrades for the Oilers like Beauchamin, or Oddya."
EdmontonOilers,3aw3ie,Hipst4r,9,Tue Jun 23 23:44:58 2015 UTC,Mike Fischer   If we get Carrie Underwood with him it sounds like a good signing.
EdmontonOilers,3aw3ie,Loire55,10,Tue Jun 23 23:54:30 2015 UTC,Swizzy > Underwood
EdmontonOilers,3aw3ie,learn2die101,1 point,Wed Jun 24 00:30:58 2015 UTC,I would debate that. Swizzy is a great spirit animal but Carrie Underwood is a stone cold fox.

EdmontonOilers,3aw3ie,haterbehatin,6,Wed Jun 24 21:11:35 2015 UTC,Fisher is staying in NSH. No thanks on Green or Franson since we already have Schultz.
EdmontonOilers,3aw3ie,haterbehatin,2,Wed Jun 24 00:49:33 2015 UTC,Then suggest someone you'd like to see. Schultz isn't a long term option in my opinion. I honestly don't think he would make any other team in the league after seeing his regression from last season.
EdmontonOilers,3aw3ie,Loire55,3,Wed Jun 24 01:01:04 2015 UTC,"I honestly don't think he would make any other team in the league after seeing his regression from last season.    I honestly have no idea what you're talking about. Led the teams defense in scoring, 7th on the entire team in scoring yet you don't think he would make any team in the entire league?  We'd all like to see more from Justin Schultz but this idea that he's not even an NHL player is just ridiculous."
EdmontonOilers,3aw3ie,haterbehatin,1 point,Wed Jun 24 01:43:36 2015 UTC,"Playing defense isn't just about the stats. I watched around 70-75 oilers games this year and I did not see a softer player on the ice in any given night. He stick checks like he's in peewee, he's too easy on opposing players, no compete, no battle. From a defensive stand point, I can't think of a player who would rank lower then him."
EdmontonOilers,3aw3ie,tsn123456789,1 point,Wed Jun 24 01:53:11 2015 UTC,"You need guys who can move the puck and create guys who can create offense.   I can't think of a single defenseman who can do what Schultz does for the team, Klefbom would be the closest.   Does his defense leave a lot to be desired? absolutely but you always need a balance of having guys who can defend like Fayne and having guys who can move the puck and create offense like Schultz."
EdmontonOilers,3aw3ie,Loire55,2,Wed Jun 24 01:59:07 2015 UTC,"I can't think of a single defenseman who can do what Schultz does for the team, Klefbom would be the closest.   You're reaching here. Klefbom moves the puck as well as Schultz and does so without the negative defensive impact (Petry did as well). There are plenty of puck moving defenceman we can pick up with significantly less defensive down side that Schultz.   Does his defense leave a lot to be desired?    That's one way to downplay it. Schultz has very little defensive ability. He is a literal fourth forward. You can watch just about any game this season (except for the two or three where he came out and played like a demon) and watch him get beat wide for a goal opportunity, beat inside, out muscled along the boards, muscled off the puck, caught deep in the offensive zone while the puck is already passing into the defensive zone, dipsy doodled because he tried to make an ineffectual poke check. Multiple times a game, every game.  Nobody is expecting Schultz to step up and be Pronger but we need significantly more from his defensive game before we are going to be a winning team. His offensive game is awesome but he is not scoring enough to overcome how many goals are afforded by his defensive lapses. Let's hope McLellan can sort that out."
EdmontonOilers,3aw3ie,tsn123456789,1 point,Wed Jun 24 17:49:29 2015 UTC,"Miscommunication on my part, I meant single defenseman on the team that can do what Schultz does offensively. Not in the entire league. That's why I pointed out Klefbom as being the closest in terms of offensive ability.   I've watched all but a couple Oilers games this year and there's not another player on the team that gets unfairly credited for fucking up than Schultz does. Which is a shame because he fucks up enough on his own.   I'm hopeful that Chiarelli can find him a partner to help cover for him and someone for Klefbom to play with so he doesn't have to shoulder the responsibility of lifting Schultz and covering Schultz.  Then it's up to TMaC to get the best out of him and Schultz to make the most of it.   I think he needs to step up his play I just think the idea mentioned that he's not an NHL player is laughable and I think it's in the best interests of the team to bring him back for at least another year to see if they can bring out the player he shows flashes of and then goes back to being frustrating to watch."
EdmontonOilers,3aw3ie,9Bains,2,Wed Jun 24 18:00:12 2015 UTC,"Who I'd like to see? Jones/Larsson/Hamilton etc. This UFA market is terrible and the guys on that list are going to get massively overpaid.    Schultz isn't a long term option in my opinion.    And 30yo Mike Green is? 28yo Franson? This is also ignoring the fact that both guys will make 1-2M more than Schultz.   I honestly don't think he would make any other team in the league after seeing his regression from last season.   So in your opinion, he's not even an NHL player? What league do you think he belongs in then?"
EdmontonOilers,3aw3ie,Loire55,1 point,Wed Jun 24 02:04:25 2015 UTC,"Just as an aside: What's wrong with 28/30? That's prime life for a defenseman and we're not looking to keep them for eight years. Thirty isn't old bud, you're just too used to a team composed of 20 year olds."
EdmontonOilers,3aw3ie,9Bains,1 point,Wed Jun 24 17:51:54 2015 UTC,"I wasn't referring to age specifically, but age + the player in question. Franson already cannot skate and if he gets a 5-6 year term like Petry he's only going to get worse. Green is presently a 3rd pairing D and aging with injury history, I don't see how he's a better longterm option than Schultz."
EdmontonOilers,3aw3ie,JuanSpiceyweiner,1 point,Wed Jun 24 17:56:28 2015 UTC,"So you want to give away a 24 year old who had a bad season for players on the decline (as you said 28 is the prime, so there's only one way to go from there)? Don't take that the wrong way, I'm not opposed to getting an older player, I'm one of the few that are in favour of bringing in Pheneuf to play on the top pairing, so long as the Leafs retain some money($2M) on that trade, I just don't see why people want to give up on Schultz. Last guy Oilers gave up on is in the running for the Vezina this year.  Schultz is a perfectly serviceable 2nd pairing Dman that was playing top pairing minutes. If he plays 2-4 less minutes a game, and and the Oilers get a real top pairing Right Dman then we're laughing. Schultz needs some cushion to protect him from playing more than he can and a someone that can show him how to do things right."

EdmontonOilers,3aw3ie,haterbehatin,3,Wed Jun 24 16:56:09 2015 UTC,Justin Williams would be just fine by me.
EdmontonOilers,3aw3ie,Eyo27,3,Tue Jun 23 23:48:46 2015 UTC,"Justin Williams would be a really good pick up by us. I know he's getting up there in age, but he's a gritty vet who has Stanley Cup experience and can still put up decent numbers. He's worth a look for sure. Maybe a 2-3 year deal for $2-2.5 Million per?"

EdmontonOilers,3aw3ie,wilyquixote,4,Wed Jun 24 01:13:26 2015 UTC,"He could be great but not at what he'll actually command in terms of salary and term.   If he could be had for what Shottaz said he makes sense, for what he'll realistically command, pass."

Hopefully we dump Nikita, Purcell and Ference  If we don't get Talbot, or a goalie in a trade, then Niemi would be my choice for goal."
EdmontonOilers,3aw41l,Eyo27,10,Tue Jun 23 23:46:53 2015 UTC,"He's not getting past the Sharks, but even hypothetically I say no.  More picks > better picks in this draft and I din't want to give up those depth picks just to grab another guy we'll have to pay heavily down the line."
EdmontonOilers,3aw41l,ProfessorScribbles,6,Wed Jun 24 00:02:33 2015 UTC,Depends on the deal and what we'd have to do. Right now as it looks Provorov is a top 6-7 pick. There is no way he drops out of the top 10. So we'd probably have to give up something pretty substantial.
EdmontonOilers,3aw41l,Shottaz83,5,Tue Jun 23 23:52:09 2015 UTC,"Fowler dropped out of the top 10 in 2010,it's possible he could fall if other teams want offense.The trade up would cost to much for the oilers especially this year"
EdmontonOilers,3aw41l,JuanSpiceyweiner,3,Wed Jun 24 00:25:50 2015 UTC,"Oh man I remember wanting Edmonton to make a play to get a pick and grab him, I guess they probably didn't have anything of value to pull that off unless they moved Eberle."
EdmontonOilers,3aw41l,haterbehatin,5,Wed Jun 24 01:19:11 2015 UTC,If the price is reasonable then definitely we should do it. Ive read that Provorov's potential is an elite #1 and those guys are impossible to get through trades. Also he seems quite well developed and could step in relatively early into the lineup. Probably not next year but one of the following two years.
EdmontonOilers,3aw41l,Colotech,3,Wed Jun 24 01:03:00 2015 UTC,"Trading up from 16 would be a big hit, as in 16 + 33 may not even be enough to do it. I think I would rather have the two picks instead of the one."
EdmontonOilers,3aw41l,learn2die101,6,Wed Jun 24 01:10:00 2015 UTC,"Look at the value of a Neidermeyer, Pronger, Doughty, Suter, Weber, etc. etc.  There's a very real chance that Provorov or Hanafin could be one of those kind of impact players. Much more risk with lower picks turning into a bust. Yes, I know either could also go all Jack Johnson on us, but there's also a chance 16th and 33rd overall are the second coming of Alex Plante and Rob Schremp"
EdmontonOilers,3aw41l,IGOR_ULANOV_55_BEST,2,Wed Jun 24 05:24:57 2015 UTC,"Trade a prospect and 16? Depends on the prospect. Trade multiple picks for a higher pick? Naw.. An actual NHL player? Naw. Moving up is pretty devalued this year. I'd rather they drop back to the twenties, grab a couple slightly later picks and stock the farm with guys Chia likes."
EdmontonOilers,3aw41l,A5hcrack,2,Wed Jun 24 05:19:45 2015 UTC,I like this idea. I've seen Chabot rated everywhere from 16 to 30. That tells me the talent pool is really tight in that range. Picking up two for one might not be a bad idea when talking about this draft class.

EdmontonOilers,3aw41l,notsoyoungpadawan,-1,Wed Jun 24 04:19:22 2015 UTC,I don't think we need him. He'll be another #1 LHD and IMO Nurse is going to be epic. A better question would be should we trade up for Hanifin. The guy is a stud and his stock has fallen in the last few months. He could slip down to 7-8 and I might be ok trading up to grab him depending on the deal.
EdmontonOilers,3aw41l,gpaine93,3,Wed Jun 24 01:12:24 2015 UTC,"So you don't want Provorov, who may end up a #1 LHD? But Hanifin, who may be a #1 (#2 more likely) LHD is the guy they should trade for? Colour me confused."

Yes get the first overall. It may be shitty to other teams in the league and I even feel a little guilty about it (I'm not sure why but a few beers seems to fix that) but it's done. McDavid isn't going to ""pull a Lindross"" and the league isn't going to abandon the draft just because the Toronto media feels entitled to Connor mcdavid!  Edit - I feel I should let op know I'm not directing this at him just frustrated with seeing articles like this and he said he was from Toronto and I zeroed in.

EdmontonOilers,3aw378,shweet44722,10,Wed Jun 24 18:51:22 2015 UTC,"No, but see any good player born in Toronto is, by default, theirs. It's only logical guyz.  Also, he wants to talk about fair? Bullshit. How many players are going to go to cities like Edmonton, Winnipeg, Ottawa unless they severely overpay when they have a chance to go to places Anaheim, San Jose, Carolina, Flordia, Tampa Bay, Dallas, etc? Not many. Players would avoid Toronto if given the chance because the Toronto media is bloodthirsty and ruthless, not to mention it's still not fun in the winter and it doesn't matter how big the city is, that media is a no go. Even if you're a home town boy, it's daunting. Besides all that, the NHL right now has decent parity. Yes, the Hawks and Kings have dominated the league for the last 4ish years, but if you compare it to leagues like the MLB, NBA (kind of), NFL, the perennial champs remain competitive year in and year out. The only team that's really stayed incredibly consistent for the playoffs has been the Wings.  There are arguments to both sides of this, but at the end of the day players are going to be more likely to go to climate friendly environments where they can play than to northern cities with cold winters and more media attention. That's not going to create fairness, that's just going to give players, especially UFAs, more reason to go to southern teams than before.  It's like what Ladd said the other day. ""If a player has a chance to go to work in shorts and a t-shirt, they're going to take it"" (or something along those lines)."

EdmontonOilers,3aw378,shweet44722,2,Wed Jun 24 01:04:42 2015 UTC,"Agreed, but most players prefer warmer weather. That and, with some of the women they marry, they prefer to be in places where they can work (models, actresses, etc). Which means big cities, generally on the coast or with big markets (LA, SJ, ANA, TB, NY).  Nope, but how often do they do those? It's better than driving to practice every day in -20 to -40 weather and living in that for the majority of the season. I mean a lot of us are born and raised in Edmonton, so we have a bit of a bias towards the city and know the lifestyle/what to expect. I could see why the guys would want to live in a warmer climate, even if a lot of us wouldn't necessarily want to do the same."

EdmontonOilers,3av77p,Arunatic5,13,Tue Jun 23 19:40:46 2015 UTC,"According to Stauffer Bruins will match 6M easy. Dougie wants 6.5x7 and the fact that he's not signed means that they're not comfortable with that cap hit or above.  As I've said before, we should go 7.3x5. I fully expect Boston to match, but that doesn't mean we shouldn't try, and he's nowhere near good enough to give up four firsts. Worst case scenario we lose nothing and Boston matches."
EdmontonOilers,3av77p,tsn123456789,1 point,Tue Jun 23 20:40:25 2015 UTC,"That number would sneak him in under the 7.305 number that would cost the oilers extra compensation.  I think I took something different from Chia's press conference than everyone else. Chia said, (when talking about past RFA's) ""I had to deal with one that was pretty public an one that was private, and now I might be in a situation that sees me on the other side of that.""  That last part is the most important. (I might be in a situation that sees me on the other side of that) It's what leads me to believe that he may already be preparing to make an offer on someone, and he's negotiating with a GM before coming out with it.   I think, if they go under the 7.305 on Dougie, it's because he wants Boston to sign him and shake someone else loose. If he goes over that 7.305 it's because he definitely wants to pull Dougie out of there. I jut do see him being alright with the compensation. (Two firsts and a second, plus.)"
EdmontonOilers,3av77p,El_reverso,1 point,Wed Jun 24 13:57:16 2015 UTC,"I really hope that's not the case, if we give up two firsts, a second, and third, it will leave us with no picks in the first three rounds for the next two years. As a guy who got Seguin and Dougie for Kessel Chia has first hand knowledge about how tossing away multiple consecutive picks can backfire hard especially with the new lottery rules. With McDavid and others needing new contracts, we are heavily reliant on ELCs to fill the rest of the roster, that won't happen if we move all of our picks."
EdmontonOilers,3av77p,tsn123456789,1 point,Wed Jun 24 14:38:41 2015 UTC,"That is a really good point. I agree with you, I don't see it happening but something hit me while reading your comment. They have guys who will be looking to break in still on ELC's they'll have control for years over guys like; Draisaitl, Yakimov, Khaira, Moroz and Chase. Not to mention Klefbom and Nurse. They might be in the best position ever to do something like that, still don't think it'll happen though lol."
EdmontonOilers,3av77p,El_reverso,6,Wed Jun 24 17:05:49 2015 UTC,"Does the compensation default to 9.8? I think, although I may be wrong? It's just the cap hit that would default. Not the compensation.   Four first would be too much, however, it doesn't hurt to throw an offer sheet his way. As long as the compensation doesn't end up being that much, best case scenario, the Oilers get Hamilton for around $7 million per year; worst case scenario, we force Boston to match him for more money than they would like, hammering a couple nails into their wheel. That's not a bad worst case.   I just wouldn't be getting my hopes up for him."

They want to give him a two year bridge deal and go from there, hoping he will turn in to that kind of player and give him the money when he has, not hoping that he will. Hamilton is a good player and I fully support the Oilers doing it, because even if he doesn't turn in to a number one Defenseman, I'd rather have a 7 million dollar number three than a 4.5 million healthy scratch; and that's what I see most of the free agent market being in three years."
EdmontonOilers,3avbcj,_TheConsumer_,14,Tue Jun 23 20:09:50 2015 UTC,"Hes really tall so he has a long reach, hes passable offensively but thats not exactly his strongest quality, hes a decent skater, not scared to throw a hit or block a shot, when he first broke into the league some said he was a Chara light, I can kinda see it but thats got its flaws too I think chara is a bit better offensively. IMO he projects to be a 2nd pairing guy. Im struggling to think of a good comparison for him outside of a Chara lite. Hope this helps a little."
EdmontonOilers,3avbcj,But-Seriously-Though,4,Tue Jun 23 20:18:01 2015 UTC,"Pretty much exactly this. Probably tops out a a 4-5 guy but he does need to really make strides this year or he'll be traded, imo."

EdmontonOilers,3avbcj,haterbehatin,3,Tue Jun 23 23:08:58 2015 UTC,Chara being a bit better offensively might be a bit of a understatement haha
EdmontonOilers,3avbcj,CeleryDistraction,2,Wed Jun 24 02:47:52 2015 UTC,Right now he seems more like a Fayne to me unless he develops some offense to his game so he'd top out as more of a bottom pairing shutdown guy who could play on the 2nd pairing but the teams probably better off if he's not.
EdmontonOilers,3avbcj,haterbehatin,1 point,Tue Jun 23 20:48:39 2015 UTC,"To add to this, he doesn't have a mean streak like Chara obviously does. He plays a very calm, cool game.

EdmontonOilers,3avbcj,HarfNarfArf,1 point,Tue Jun 23 23:26:51 2015 UTC,"While he may hit from time to time, the consensus knock on Marincin is that he doesn't make the hard nosed play when he needs to."
EdmontonOilers,3avbcj,beevbo,5,Wed Jun 24 04:05:30 2015 UTC,"Misused player. He can play both sides and was one of the few players that didn't improve under Nelson. I rate him higher than JSchultz, but below the likes of Nurse and Klefbom. He is seen as n expendable asset because Nurse and Klef are both LHDs as well. He has pretty good shot differential totals, although his point totals are lacking, he plays good stickwork defense, but needs to muscle up to handle a forecheck.  I think it's a mistake moving him - just like it was with moving Hejda."
EdmontonOilers,3avbcj,VanPerstrings,4,Tue Jun 23 21:23:36 2015 UTC,"Marincin is a 6'4"" lenky 23 year old. Last season he was paired with Jeff Petry and was basically put in the shutdown role. Marincin did great along side Petry, they were often our only defencemen who showed up most nights. But the 2014-2015 season came along and Marincin unexpectedly did not make it out of camp but was later brought up playing 41 games this year.  This year Marincin has shown more offense in his game than last year. Possibly from being with Mark Fayne and now having to defend by himself. He's getting better with his breakout passes, but they still need work. Although his defensive skills might have regressed this year, I believe he became a more well rounded player more suited towards a #4 role."
EdmontonOilers,3avbcj,Hipst4r,2,Tue Jun 23 20:20:18 2015 UTC,"He has all the tools, he just needs to get stronger.

Building some more muscle in the off season should help his strength and confidence."

EdmontonOilers,3avbcj,shittier_unidan,1 point,Tue Jun 23 21:15:53 2015 UTC,"The one thing Marincin does really well, is he stays calm under pressure. Behind the net, in board battles where he has the puck, and a forechecker is attacking, he makes it look easy. A little pivot, a little fake, and he's bought some time to make a play.  With his toolset, and his calm play, Marincin should be a top 4 dman on any team for a very long time, but only if he works on those very glaring deficiencies in his game. Eakins, Nelson, Fleming and MacTavish all wanted him to be stronger, and all came out and said he wasn't strong enough. Some of those guys don't have a lot of credibility, but Nelson and Fleming do."

EdmontonOilers,3avbcj,Tylemaker,1 point,Wed Jun 24 04:01:13 2015 UTC,"Still very raw, but is already a serviceable bottom pairing guy with top 4 potential. If you guys get offered an NHL defence an for a goalie who either can't repeat what he did last year in a far more open system and that you were going to lose next July anyway, you'd be dumb not to take it, and the Oilers would be dumb to offer it."
EdmontonOilers,3avbcj,A5hcrack,1 point,Wed Jun 24 04:21:33 2015 UTC,"He's good enough that unless the trade brings back a top pair defenseman from a team that needs to dump salary, I'd rather they just kept the kid. Tall but not big for his height. Not overly strong but plays a good positional game usually. He always showed flashes of offensive ability before Eakins beat him down when he came up from the AHL. He was a high energy offensive defenseman as a rookie but showed none of that during last season's dumpster fire. He was good when he played with a steady partner, but isn't a shut down guy you can pair with someone who doesn't protect the puck. If he put on weight and worked on his conditioning it's possible he could be."
EdmontonOilers,3au7hg,putzeh,24,Tue Jun 23 15:25:49 2015 UTC,"And for that price, in this draft, the NYR can keep Talbot. Maybe we can just pick him up in free agency next year.  It's just bad asset management to throw those picks at a guy you can't even negotiate a new contract with until January.  I think Talbot would be a great fit in Edmonton, but if we're shipping out two second round picks, even if one is in 2016, I'd rather just upgrade the defense and sign a ""quick fix"" goalie like Ramo until we can land a established number 1 for other assets."
EdmontonOilers,3au7hg,Ebs14,4,Tue Jun 23 15:34:27 2015 UTC,"I would actually be very happy with Ramo.

As their duties get divided and as we improve on our defence - Chia talked about this yesterday saying he plans to blend goalie + defence together to form one unit that functions in cohesion with each other (I'm paraphrasing) - I'm sure Scrivvy's performances will improve."
EdmontonOilers,3au7hg,notsoyoungpadawan,27,Tue Jun 23 16:24:34 2015 UTC,I think this is where I would turn away from Talbot. NY are trying to inflate his price based on the interest in him and we should be taking a stand against it. Lehner or Lack for me at this point.
EdmontonOilers,3au7hg,notsoyoungpadawan,14,Tue Jun 23 15:32:36 2015 UTC,Eddie! Eddie! Eddie!
EdmontonOilers,3au7hg,Ebs14,5,Tue Jun 23 15:40:50 2015 UTC,"Lack is my favourite goalie on the market, but the Canucks hate trading with us. Especially for a guy who should be our #1 for hopefully at least a couple 9f years"
EdmontonOilers,3au7hg,ipooblood,3,Tue Jun 23 17:16:10 2015 UTC,"I mean sure we're rivals, but both of our GM's are new and Benning said it doesn't matter"
EdmontonOilers,3au7hg,AlleyBj,2,Tue Jun 23 17:46:40 2015 UTC,"I'd just look into Niemi. Solid veteran who has proven he can handle a starter's workload (so not like Scrivens...). And he has cup experience, and he's only 31.  I would stay away from unproven goalies who have only had short hot streaks. Ie, Lehner/Lack. I'm not saying they're bad goalies, it just isn't worth the risk. We could also go after Anderson, although word out of Ottawa was they'd rather move Lehner than Anderson."
EdmontonOilers,3au7hg,AllisGreat,1 point,Tue Jun 23 22:08:09 2015 UTC,"Niemi's numbers are very average, so I really don't understand why everyone keeps saying that he's proven. Not to mention the fact that he tends to choke in big games."
EdmontonOilers,3au7hg,notsoyoungpadawan,1 point,Wed Jun 24 02:23:17 2015 UTC,"Niemi's numbers are average, but that's over a 60+ game season, and in multiple seasons. I'd take that over a 20 game stretch of .925 sv% any day.   He chokes in big games? That must be why he was able to win a cup right?"
EdmontonOilers,3au7hg,AllisGreat,0,Wed Jun 24 03:08:04 2015 UTC,"36 game stretch actually, and I don't understand why you'd purposely take an average goalie over a potential great goalie. Worst case scenario Talbot ends up like Niemi.  He won the cup in 2010. He was 25/26 then. It also had a lot to do with the team in front of him. Oh btw, Niemi only played 39 games that season excluding the play-offs, so about the same as Talbot this season, except Niemi's numbers were still just as bad."
EdmontonOilers,3au7hg,notsoyoungpadawan,2,Wed Jun 24 03:18:42 2015 UTC,I'd say worst case scenario Talbot performs like Scrivens did this year.
EdmontonOilers,3au7hg,haterbehatin,3,Wed Jun 24 03:55:29 2015 UTC,"The chance of that happening is very low. I'm assuming you're assuming that based on Scrivens in LA - Talbot in NY. Only Scrivens had 19 games TOTAL for LA, while Talbot has been consistently good for NY in 57 games over the past 2 seasons."
EdmontonOilers,3au7hg,notsoyoungpadawan,2,Wed Jun 24 03:59:13 2015 UTC,"Oh I don't think it'll happen either but I'm just going off actual worst case scenario.   Could you imagine if Chia gave up the 16th pick for Talbot to play like Ben Scrivens did this year, that'd be awful."
EdmontonOilers,3au7hg,haterbehatin,2,Wed Jun 24 04:09:10 2015 UTC,"If that happened, it would be the anti-McJesus. No way does Chia give up the #16 for Talbot though, so we can both rest easy!"
EdmontonOilers,3au7hg,notsoyoungpadawan,1 point,Wed Jun 24 04:11:14 2015 UTC,"Except Niemi's played 60+ games every season since then, AND he's familiar with Todd McLellan and did very well under his system."

EdmontonOilers,3au7hg,Loire55,2,Tue Jun 23 17:01:02 2015 UTC,"2014-15 season was so bad all of us is just trying to pretend the year didn't happen, but hey! McDavid!"
EdmontonOilers,3au7hg,mkwong,2,Tue Jun 23 18:00:48 2015 UTC,"I don't know why this keeps coming up though, Benning has dealt with division rivals, there haven't been any clear divisional prices, that was a Gillis thing, Gillis is gone."
EdmontonOilers,3au7hg,haterbehatin,3,Tue Jun 23 17:18:44 2015 UTC,Poor memory on my part mostly.
EdmontonOilers,3au7hg,Loire55,2,Tue Jun 23 17:28:40 2015 UTC,You're not the only one though it seems a lot of people around here cite that divisional premium.   Actually depending on their relationship Benning and Chiarelli could make great trading partners after working together in Boston.
EdmontonOilers,3au7hg,haterbehatin,1 point,Tue Jun 23 17:30:19 2015 UTC,I'm pretty sure Chia won't give away a 16th for a one year rental.
EdmontonOilers,3au7hg,parecon,1 point,Tue Jun 23 16:41:16 2015 UTC,"Lehner is like Fasth 2.0 with his injury problems, and Lack's advanced stats show about exactly the same as Scrivens'. Talbot is clearly the best available asset on the market, and the Rangers are going to get the most possible value out of that asset whether you like it or not. I'm sure Slats will hold out til drafting starts when the desperation plays start happening.  Calgary has three 2nds, it was probably their offer. Two 2nds from the Oilers would probably be worth a little more with our 33rd pick.  IMO, you should be going after the best possible upgrade you can make. I agree that you shouldn't mortgage the future too much. But maybe if there was a deal like Oilers' 16th pick for Talbot and New York's 59th, there's a deal to be made there?"
EdmontonOilers,3au7hg,notsoyoungpadawan,1 point,Tue Jun 23 19:25:50 2015 UTC,"Except Lehner is like 10 years younger and his injury problems have only been concussions.  And I would still not be happy giving up 2 seconds for Talbot. That's overpaying in this draft. A 2nd and a 3rd is the highest that I'd go for him, especially in this goalie UFA market. There are plenty of other options who would work well for us. We only have to hold out till Brossoit is comfortable enough to be brought up to the team."
EdmontonOilers,3au7hg,Arunatic5,7,Wed Jun 24 02:28:21 2015 UTC,Eh. It's Dreger. Not sure how much I actually believe this rumour.
EdmontonOilers,3au7hg,haterbehatin,1 point,Tue Jun 23 15:35:58 2015 UTC,Yeah but I think the Toronto Maple Leafs wouldn't even trade James Reimer for Nail Yakupov at this point.
EdmontonOilers,3au7hg,haterbehatin,10,Tue Jun 23 17:19:15 2015 UTC,"Two 2nds for Talbot? and they want more? Yeah that's a big no thanks Glen, if the Oilers are paying that price I want Bernier or to roll the dice on Ramo."
EdmontonOilers,3au7hg,haterbehatin,12,Tue Jun 23 15:33:02 2015 UTC,I hope Slats heard what Chai said yesterday - There are more goalies than teams who need them.
EdmontonOilers,3au7hg,DocDiggler,3,Tue Jun 23 15:37:52 2015 UTC,"I'm cool with Talbot being traded elsewhere though if someone wants to pay that price.  Squeeze down the number of teams looking for goaltenders and then Edmonton can poke around, Lack, Lehner, Bernier and look at free agents.   I like enough of the guys available that I'd be totally cool with waiting out the market."
EdmontonOilers,3au7hg,haterbehatin,4,Tue Jun 23 15:42:07 2015 UTC,"Wouldn't it be funny if we missed out on Talbot this year cause someone paid a second then managed to sign him long term when he goes UFA next year? There's also a goalie market next year, I think we should be hedging our bets on Talbot so we can't miss out on potential players in the future because we don't have valuable picks. There's always the chance he could go full Scrivens for us."
EdmontonOilers,3au7hg,DocDiggler,3,Tue Jun 23 16:21:39 2015 UTC,"Yeah I like Talbot I don't think he'll go Scrivens hell I don't even think Scrivens will go full Scrivens next year... but for what they're rumoured to be asking HELL NO!    There's too many guys available to fall in love with one of them and pay a stupid price.  Good point about the picks too I'm assuming 2 years from now is when they won't have a 2nd and third and if there are trades available for a big name like Hamilton (unlikely I know) they might not have any picks in the first 3 rounds for a couple of years.   Hell if that's the asking price for Talbot give me Blackwood in the 2nd, go after Lehner (not for a 2nd) and Ramo or Niemi in free agency.  Then you get Present, potential future, potential long term future and all for less than the cost of Cam Talbot."
EdmontonOilers,3au7hg,haterbehatin,3,Tue Jun 23 16:26:50 2015 UTC,I'm confident McLellan will get us playing hockey rather than having a 60 min game of shinny every night. I blame Eakins hard for all of our goaltending problems. If it wasn't for the swarm Dubnyk wouldn't have fallen off so far so fast. Better team systems and (hopefully) some acquisitions on our back end will help Scribbles and whoever we manage to get this off season.  I'm totally turned off of Talbot now. I want nothing to do with him. Sather is clearly trying to milk the situation and I hope Chia isn't desperate enough to sell the farm. Our rebuild is far from over. We aren't in a position to be getting rid of picks for players.   I'd totally take Blackwood or even Vladar with a second. i'm pretty sure Samsonov is heading to either Buffalo or Arizona anyways unless we draft him with the 16th  (we won't).   We still need to build the secondary core that will grow with McDavid and replace the inevitable departure of the present core that we can't hold on to forever.
EdmontonOilers,3au7hg,DocDiggler,3,Tue Jun 23 16:41:26 2015 UTC,"Our rebuild is far from over. We aren't in a position to be getting rid of picks for players.    I think this is the key, no overpaying even if it might make the team a little bit better right now.   The emphasis has to either be on trading for long term players (which Chiarelli has said) or trying to pick up players so that there's an influx of talent in coming years whether that be defense, goaltending or forwards.  I'm still not convinced they'll have to move one of the big names for cap reasons, maybe for positional need but if there are cap issues you need guys in the pipeline.   The other concern is that even when the team gets good I'm not convinced it's going to be the most desirable location for free agents or young college free agents. End of the day it's still Edmonton not Chicago or New York.   I think it'll get better as the team grows but probably not to the point where Chicago is and they can just recruit reinforcements seemingly at will."
EdmontonOilers,3au7hg,haterbehatin,3,Tue Jun 23 16:54:44 2015 UTC,"The McDavid effect got us Chiarelli and McLellan. I'm not ruling out the impossible anymore and if McD is the real deal, people are going to want to play with him. That's just the way it works.   It seems people who play here love the city and the people and also like having a fanbase that has passion for hockey. I don't think it's as bad a place as we make it out to be. It's just the fact we haven't done anything significant since 06 and not really anything since the late 80s. Once we can prove we can win, it'll be easier on our cap and attracting free agents. But we have to win, not get marginally better. That's why we need to take advantage of the draft and not try to make a playoff team from other guys leftovers and castoffs."
EdmontonOilers,3au7hg,DocDiggler,2,Tue Jun 23 17:30:41 2015 UTC,"I don't know that it's necessarily that Edmonton is bad it's just if you have the option of a big well known US city like Chicago or New York there's a draw there or if you have the option of living in Florida with no media and living on the beach all winger there's a draw there.   So I don't think the problem will be keeping guys in Edmonton, I think it's the hurdles of luring the guys with options to Edmonton."
EdmontonOilers,3au7hg,parecon,2,Tue Jun 23 17:36:07 2015 UTC,"There's a bit of truth in that which explains why all the California teams are so damn good but that doesn't explain why the Lightning and Panthers have had so much trouble finding success. The lightning used the draft to get their core players, Hedman, Stamkos, Kucherov and the Panthers aren't at that point yet but might be soon. It's not really the free agents we should be concentrating on anyways. But signing players long term once they're here hasn't really been a problem with the exception of Pronger. Chicago wasn't a place free agents wanted to go until they had the young core that enabled them to win. NY is the only city you can't use as a comparable to Edmonton but there are advantages to being here rather than there if you can believe it.   I don't know, if I'm an athlete that passion from the fans and seeing hockey on the front page of the papers would be very appealing to me. It would feel shitty to think Nascar has a bigger following than an NHL team I bleed for every game as an athlete. What's the point in that scenario? Athletes want to win and are very competitive. We don't want the players that are here for the paycheque and that's for damn sure."
EdmontonOilers,3au7hg,But-Seriously-Though,2,Tue Jun 23 18:28:18 2015 UTC,"Hell if that's the asking price for Talbot give me Blackwood in the 2nd, go after Lehner (not for a 2nd) and Ramo or Niemi in free agency.   This is proper asset management.  Although unlikely, maybe we snag Samsonov with the 33rd too."
EdmontonOilers,3au7hg,haterbehatin,2,Tue Jun 23 16:38:32 2015 UTC,"Thats not much of a goalie market next year when you consider many of those guys will have extensions signed, backstrom will probably retire, and the rest are all RFAs that will be hard to lure away from their current teams, your looking at a similar maybe slightly watered down version of this year."

You also have to factor in that there are some promising guys coming up from the AHL who will become more known as well and be available in trade."
EdmontonOilers,3au7hg,haterbehatin,2,Tue Jun 23 17:17:46 2015 UTC,"I like enough of the guys available that I'd be totally cool with waiting out the market.   Hell, I'd be fine waiting a year rather than overpaying.  This draft is too good to squander the 16th."
EdmontonOilers,3au7hg,TheTravellingMan,1 point,Tue Jun 23 16:24:31 2015 UTC,"Even 2nd rounders I don't know enough about the goalies but if they like Blackwood or Booth they can take some shots to address the long term future of goaltending.   Either way they have to address defense and goaltending, no need to overpay for a goaltender and then have less assets to find defense.   I think I'd rather use those two 2nds to get a defenseman and just sign a goalie."

EdmontonOilers,3au7hg,notsoyoungpadawan,7,Tue Jun 23 16:09:41 2015 UTC,it could also be a conditional 2016 second on the chance he signs a contract for the team that traded for him. That's the only scenario that makes any sense to me.

EdmontonOilers,3au7hg,parecon,2,Tue Jun 23 17:33:10 2015 UTC,"Sather can fuck off, then. Chia's too smart to play such an extreme price for a guy who's been behind such a good defense for all of his career, not to mention the other 10 options out there that'd cost less or literally nothing but money.  Trying to rig the price so high in a buyer's market is an attempt at highway robbery and I don't want Talbot that badly.  Neuvirth, Enroth, Ramo and Nemo would all be nothing but dosh and term.  Eddie or Gibson please, let's not take a risk on a guy with concussion and injury issues like Lehner."

People may call him boring, and part of it may be media training, but at this point it seems that being humble, quiet and giving ""boring"" interviews is just his personality. He may not be like Ovi where he'll get hammered at the all-star draft, but it's not like he lacks confidence (like he said). Seems like he just prefers to do his talking on the ice.  It's funny, prior to the draft lottery I remember a lot of people on the sub saying that Smytty was this generation's Gretzky, that Oiler that everyone looked up to and admired, and I still agree with that...but we're going to be incredibly lucky that another generation will get to watch this kid wear the blue and orange. It'll be that thing where, in 25 years, we'll be able to say ""I remember when McDavid still had a baby face and when the lottery draft happened. I remember him suiting up as an Oiler, all of the hype, anticipation and excitement"", similar to how older Oilers fans who got to watch Gretzky talk about those 80s teams.  God I'm excited. I feel giddy just talking about all this. I shouldn't react this way to something so trivial, but at the same time it's important. It's funny the impact sports can have on a city, a culture and an identity, and it's going to be amazing how much McDavid will become part of Edmontonian pride.  3 days away from a historic day in Oilers history. Can't wait."
EdmontonOilers,3arta2,shweet44722,5,Tue Jun 23 06:58:01 2015 UTC,I don't know if you saw the other article but his former teammate in Erie Stephen  Harper not the Ottawa dB told a story about McDavid wearing his Toronto equipment in training camp his first year in Erie because in his mind he hadn't made the team yet.  No presumption just wants to go out there and prove it.   edit- the article about soon to be superstar Connor McDavid just in case anyone missed it.
EdmontonOilers,3arta2,haterbehatin,2,Tue Jun 23 12:02:22 2015 UTC,"That's incredible, thanks for the link!"
EdmontonOilers,3arta2,shweet44722,2,Tue Jun 23 17:22:22 2015 UTC,"I always like those articles, it's weird to remember these guys are just kids. They're exceptionally skilled at hockey but they're still so young and just normalish high schoolers."
EdmontonOilers,3arta2,haterbehatin,3,Tue Jun 23 17:27:08 2015 UTC,"No kidding. I mean he went back to graduate high school.......after playing in a massive tournament where he was the centre of attention, going to the NHL combine and singing a marketing contract with Reebok CCM. 4 years ago I was watching midnight premieres of Marvel movies and eating pie. It just blows my mind how these kids can be ridiculously skilled high schoolers, and like you said, normalish high schoolers.  I still love the bit about how Connor doesn't really get recognized at his school as the hockey talent he is. If he was in Canada he'd be hands down the most popular kid but he got to lead a semi-normal high school life in Erie."
EdmontonOilers,3arta2,shweet44722,2,Tue Jun 23 17:31:17 2015 UTC,Yeah I think we probably all have those feelings like oh what was I doing in high school? and Connor McDavid was playing in front of 18 thousand plus at the ACC as one of the guys with the hope of a Nation on his back trying to bring a Gold medal to Canada.   Yet there I was watching a bunch of Jackasses smack each other in the nuts eating smuggled in candy.
EdmontonOilers,3arta2,haterbehatin,2,Tue Jun 23 17:36:51 2015 UTC,"lol forgot about that...coming back from a broken hand that got more attention in Canada than most NHL action that day.  Yeah, but can Connor smuggle candy into movies? NOPE. Mainly because he doesn't have to anymore....."
EdmontonOilers,3arta2,shweet44722,2,Tue Jun 23 17:42:39 2015 UTC,"I'm still impressed how well he was holding his own in that fight up until he smacked the boards.. yet some people think they should stick him with Gazdic to ""protect"" him."
EdmontonOilers,3arta2,haterbehatin,2,Tue Jun 23 19:39:42 2015 UTC,"He was throwin haymakers too. I think we'll see a couple NHL fights from him. I mean even the Nuge went full goon at one point.  I don't understand that. Gazdic is great and all but the guy can't play hockey. Crosby and Stamkos don't have enforcers with them, why would we stick a guy who can't compete at the NHL level on our second line? Besides, it's not like it's going to stop people from hitting or taking runs at McDavid, it'll just mean he can retaliate, which hasn't stopped anyone in the past. Besides all that, McDavid can take care of himself, and if he's playing with Hall/Yak/etc, I don't see whoever goes after him getting far.  There were suggestions of having Hendo play with him...better option than Thor but still no."
EdmontonOilers,3arta2,Girthworthy,2,Tue Jun 23 22:57:18 2015 UTC,"That's what I thought too McDavid is an elite talent he'll probably get a few good shots but he's going to be able to avoid the majority of them.   Gazdic just isin't an NHL level skater so there's no way he's going to keep up with a skater like McDavid.   I hate the idea of giving him an enforcer in general, Hendo is great where he is doing what he does no need to try to force him out of his comfort level with McDavid.   I think if they want some toughness on McDavid's wing it'll come from maybe Purcell or Pitlick or I've seen some suggest Ward but he only works if it's a 2 year deal in my view.   Generally speaking I like the forwards they have and if they pick up another one I guess I've said a few times but I'd prefer they pick up some depth after free agent frenzy is done.   There's usually some underrated guys available who could contribute. The Leafs did really well with Winnik and I think Santorelli last off season."
EdmontonOilers,3arta2,shweet44722,3,Tue Jun 23 23:07:12 2015 UTC,thanks for the chills and goose bumps. i cant wait to tell my kids about the day Mcdavid came to town.

I'll be honest, I may have to buy the tickets well ahead of time if I want to see the Oilers vs. Sens this year, although I'm not even sure if I can afford the tickets. McDavid's going to increase prices and I had a hard time affording the 300 level tickets I got last year as is."

EdmontonOilers,3asfal,shweet44722,2,Tue Jun 23 04:01:19 2015 UTC,"Thanks! What's a hard camera side? Is that where video cameras are located?  I noticed on a map of the seats, that there are a bunch of camera operators on the side with the benches. That made me curious if they do any presentations or special nights, that they may be facing the benches."
EdmontonOilers,3asfal,shweet44722,5,Tue Jun 23 04:43:43 2015 UTC,"I see you've never been a GDT! (running joke)  Rexall is the opposite of literally every NHL rink and has the camera on the same side of the ice as the benches, so they'll be broadcasting from that side regardless of event."
EdmontonOilers,3asfal,Tyaust,3,Tue Jun 23 04:46:27 2015 UTC,"Ok I feel really dumb now... GDT? Lol is that game day... Thread?  Oh man, ok so in that case, because Rexall is backwards, does this mean the benches side is better or really, it's all the same?  I wonder if that's changing for the new arena? I should pick wisely because whichever I choose may be the side I end up on there too lol..."
EdmontonOilers,3asfal,IamMcLovin2015,5,Tue Jun 23 04:52:43 2015 UTC,"Yup, no you got it! It's just the threads that get posted about an hour before game time during the regular season where people can watch the games and comment. Most of us are in there because we don't otherwise have people to watch the game with. I know for me it's how I recognize a lot of users around r/hockey and got to know an number of people on this sub, was via those threads.  Uhm, good question. It's honestly been a while since I've been to Rexall, but if you're higher up, either side shouldn't be a major issue. When you say Upper Level, you mean like 200 level seats right? Penalty box side is probably a good bet IMO.  That's a very good question. I imagine they'll change to suit the rest of the league, but that they'd let you re-pick your seats? Idk, I'm guessing you could probably call the season tickets services for that questions because I haven't the foggiest and the last thing I'd want to do is lead you astray."

Wonder if that means one or more of the RFA's are on the trading block, specifically Marincin or Schultz. If there's been no rumours of talks and the deadline is quickly approaching...  I'd obviously like to see them re-sign Marincin, but I think Schultz and Davidson are worth re-singing as well."
EdmontonOilers,3ar750,shweet44722,6,Mon Jun 22 22:04:46 2015 UTC,"I think the deadline is the 25th of this month so I would expect news soon. Schultz may be y'know himself but I think he's too valueable to just let walk so I hope they qualify and then trade him.

EdmontonOilers,3ar750,TheTravellingMan,5,Mon Jun 22 22:16:32 2015 UTC,"Pitlick would be an okay re-sign, he's had some bad luck and I'm not sure if we've really been able to see what he can do at an NHL level. I don't hate Schultz as much as I used to, but he has a big contract for what he does. If we had him at 2 mil I'd be perfectly happy to keep him. I trust the new management whatever they decide though (when was the last time you could say that!)."
EdmontonOilers,3ar750,haterbehatin,4,Mon Jun 22 22:35:53 2015 UTC,"I don't really see his contract as an issue, it's short term and the Oilers aren't a cap team currently.  Unless the plan is to spend like drunken sailors they can easily absorb Schultz even if he is a bit overpaid.   He'd be heavily underpaid at 2 million though, Ference makes 3.25."
EdmontonOilers,3ar750,Ebs14,2,Mon Jun 22 22:46:31 2015 UTC,"We likely won't be taking him to reverse arbitration, so a 2 million dollar contract is probably out of the question, but that would have been perfect with a ton of bonuses if he hit the targets of his first season."
EdmontonOilers,3ar750,haterbehatin,1 point,Mon Jun 22 23:45:00 2015 UTC,2 million contract is definitely not happening. If we take him to team-elected arbitration it'll still cut him down to just north of 3 million minimum.

EdmontonOilers,3apqgg,Shottaz83,10,Mon Jun 22 16:33:12 2015 UTC,"Let me guess, we'll also have to forfeit a pick to Ottawa even though he hasn't worked for over a year now, and they fired him. If this rule isn't tweaked to fix this colossal oversight, then the NHL is really fucking dumb."
EdmontonOilers,3apqgg,Arunatic5,9,Mon Jun 22 15:03:17 2015 UTC,Rule no longer applies. The change was enacted after the Oilers hires were done.
EdmontonOilers,3apqgg,Shottaz83,3,Mon Jun 22 15:22:33 2015 UTC,Really? I guess I must've missed it.
EdmontonOilers,3apqgg,haterbehatin,3,Mon Jun 22 15:23:27 2015 UTC,I never heard that so I'm not sure about that. I know they were planning on discussing it.  There wouldn't be compensation because there is no compensation for the role he would be taking.
EdmontonOilers,3apqgg,Arunatic5,5,Mon Jun 22 16:11:46 2015 UTC,"Technically going to be official on Wednesday, but the plan was in motion for a while now. Just needed a BoG meeting to make it official."
EdmontonOilers,3apqgg,haterbehatin,3,Mon Jun 22 16:25:09 2015 UTC,"Oh nice, good news that the league pulled its head out of its ass bad news that Edmonton got fucked before that happened."
EdmontonOilers,3apqgg,shweet44722,2,Mon Jun 22 16:28:37 2015 UTC,Lebrun is skeptical that it's changing on Wednesday
EdmontonOilers,3apqgg,haterbehatin,2,Mon Jun 22 19:55:56 2015 UTC,Oh snap. They need to get it done but they need to do what they should've done in the first place and get it done correctly.
EdmontonOilers,3apqgg,shweet44722,2,Mon Jun 22 19:57:55 2015 UTC,"They should fix it Wednesday. That means there's a good chance any team that picks up Paulrus is going to lose a pick, because I don't see Murray shying away from taking advantage of a stupid rule. Unless the NHL announces that the rule won't change yet but compensation is no longer in effect.....like that'll ever happen."
EdmontonOilers,3apqgg,haterbehatin,3,Mon Jun 22 20:01:42 2015 UTC,"Compensation is only for Head Coaches and General Managers, I've heard President as well but I'm not sure about that one because I've only heard HC and GM.   That's why the Oilers aren't getting compensation for Nelson.   So the good news is the Oilers don't have to worry about getting fucked anymore, bad news is it's a little too late."
EdmontonOilers,3apqgg,Arunatic5,2,Mon Jun 22 20:03:58 2015 UTC,"I mean Toronto didn't give compensation for Babcock, and he was signed before his contract with Detroit ended."
EdmontonOilers,3apqgg,shweet44722,2,Tue Jun 23 00:31:43 2015 UTC,"So wouldn't Ottawa be able to get compensation for Paulrus then, seeing as he was a HC?"

EdmontonOilers,3apqgg,Arunatic5,3,Mon Jun 22 14:35:52 2015 UTC,I'd Paulrus in a non-HC role. He key attributes is knowing how to coach and lead a young team. His problem was giving minutes to bad players just because.
EdmontonOilers,3apqgg,B0mb-Hands,3,Mon Jun 22 15:23:41 2015 UTC,I'm down for the Todd and Paulrus Show
EdmontonOilers,3apqgg,arcticcatherder,1 point,Mon Jun 22 17:23:57 2015 UTC,"I didn't follow Ottawa or Paulrus much other than seeing his clone in the stands behind him. Anyone care to give me a briefer on him? Is this good? And if so, do you think he'd be interested in coming to the Oilers?"
EdmontonOilers,3apqgg,shweet44722,2,Mon Jun 22 17:44:11 2015 UTC,"Well, there's no more HC jobs and I don't see Maclean going to the AHL, so we have a shot.  As for how he coaches...he's not bad. He's definitely a good coach, but he loves his gritty veterans. To the point where he'll play them rather than the younger, more skilled and more effective players (like Phillips and Neil playing over Pageau, Stone and Hoffman earlier in the year)."
EdmontonOilers,3apqgg,arcticcatherder,2,Mon Jun 22 19:39:51 2015 UTC,"Grit is good but finesse players need to be played as well. It sounds like as long as he isn't the HC, it should work out? Thanks for some insight!"
EdmontonOilers,3apqgg,shweet44722,2,Mon Jun 22 20:04:38 2015 UTC,"Grit is needed, but not when the grit would be the equivalent of playing Ference as a forward (Phillips may as well be the Ference of the Sens).  Seems that way! He was experience with young star players, he's had past success and would bring knowledge to the team. Sens got their ""pesky Sens"" moniker under him, so bringing that tenacity to the organization would certainly be beneficial for us. I'd be happy with him as an AC! HC I'd have some reservations, but he'd make a good AC.  No problem!"
EdmontonOilers,3apqgg,arcticcatherder,2,Mon Jun 22 20:15:12 2015 UTC,OMG yikes when envisioning your Ference reference LOL!!! I guess we shall wait and see where he goes. Is it just us and Anaheim that are in talks with him right now?
EdmontonOilers,3apqgg,shweet44722,2,Mon Jun 22 20:53:00 2015 UTC,"I think we're the only two that have asked permission, so I believe so for the moment.  Chia came out and said we'll have 2 assistant coaches by Friday, and Woodcroft is already pretty much confirmed to be one of them, so I'd imagine that he has either Paulrus or someone else lined up."
EdmontonOilers,3apqgg,arcticcatherder,2,Mon Jun 22 20:55:56 2015 UTC,"You just answered a question I just posted! You must be a mindreader too LOL! Thank you!  I just read about Chia saying we should hopefully have two by Friday, and I wanted to see who the other one was. That explains it. So much stuff happening right now it's been hard for me to keep track! Exciting times!   I wonder if Chia has a backup plan for AC if Paulrus doesn't come to the Oilers. Has there been talk of other possibilities he may be after?"
EdmontonOilers,3apqgg,shweet44722,2,Mon Jun 22 20:59:37 2015 UTC,"Haha convenient timing! No problem at all.  Agreed! It's pure chaos to keep track of but very exciting!  Not that I've heard of, but I wouldn't be surprised if he's got something in mind/lined up. I'm sure he knows it's not a guaranteed thing and he wouldn't make a statement like that without having something already worked out. He maaaay also be talking about Woodcroft and Rocky Thompson. He hasn't announced he's firing Thompson or hiring Woodcroft, so it may actually be those two that he's confirming and potentially whoever else he may hire between now and then, if anything."
EdmontonOilers,3apqgg,arcticcatherder,2,Mon Jun 22 21:05:05 2015 UTC,"Good to know!  I just watched the replay of Chia's presser, and I noticed that he said ""2 ADDITIONAL assistant coaches"" but friday. So did he mean three total or I wonder if he was referring to just the two..."
EdmontonOilers,3apqgg,shweet44722,1 point,Mon Jun 22 22:39:41 2015 UTC,"Hmm, 2 additional makes me think that it'd be 3 total. Thompson would be one, and Woodcroft is likely one of them so there's one we don't know of yet which could be Paulrus or someone else."

EdmontonOilers,3apz2q,notsoyoungpadawan,1 point,Mon Jun 22 15:46:08 2015 UTC,I'm fine with the just the 33rd or the 16th for Talbot and Klein (at only $3 and better than most our D corps) though Staal would be equally awesome (and equally unlikely).
EdmontonOilers,3apz2q,greenbasterd,8,Mon Jun 22 16:20:23 2015 UTC,"I would NOT be ok with us trading the #16 pick, especially for a goalie who is UFA in a year and an average defenceman. That #16 pick could get us a stud defenceman or a quality C. I'm not willing to give that up for Talbot."

EdmontonOilers,3apz2q,Arunatic5,6,Tue Jun 23 06:36:15 2015 UTC,Klein is a 3rd pairing guy. The last thing we need is another overpaid 5-6 defenseman.
EdmontonOilers,3apz2q,YouJagaloon,3,Mon Jun 22 16:34:14 2015 UTC,"He's also better defensively than everyone on our team except Klefbom and Fayne, while being $1.5M cheaper than Nikitin."
EdmontonOilers,3apz2q,learn2die101,8,Mon Jun 22 16:37:54 2015 UTC,"He plays 3rd pairing behind a very good NYR team. If we thrust him into our 1st or 2nd pairing here, he's going to flounder the same way Ference did.   That 16th overall pick has way too much value to trade it for a 3rd pairing defensemen on the wrong side of 30, and an unproven, pending UFA goaltender."
EdmontonOilers,3apz2q,haterbehatin,0,Mon Jun 22 16:45:40 2015 UTC,"Right, but if we shove Him on second pairing (or O-zone start pairing) with Jultz, it could be a good fit."

EdmontonOilers,3appgt,Lucz1848,11,Mon Jun 22 15:06:07 2015 UTC,"Eh. I mean drafting hasn't been our forte, but it was remarkably improved since 2012. I mean we have guys now that can be called prospects even though they were drafted in the 3rd round (Khaira, Zharkov, Slepyshev, Yakimov), 4th round (Platzer), 5th round (Laleggia), and even the 7th round (Chase). Hopefully we keep at least SOME of the right people."
EdmontonOilers,3appgt,Arunatic5,10,Mon Jun 22 15:29:46 2015 UTC,I was listening 1260 this morning on my way to work and they were attributing a lot of drafting failures to Tambellini overriding the scouting staff.
EdmontonOilers,3appgt,haterbehatin,6,Mon Jun 22 16:51:12 2015 UTC,"I think 2010 wasn't that terrible. Pitlick looks like a player likely a bottom 6 one but a player, Marincin I haven't given up on yet and I thought Curtis Hamilton was done but he had a good year this year so maybe he's not a lost cause yet although like Pitlick if he makes it he's a bottom 6 forward."
EdmontonOilers,3appgt,Arunatic5,3,Mon Jun 22 15:48:35 2015 UTC,"I started from 2012 cause 2011 was fairly poor in terms of actual success, and 2010 was just OK."
EdmontonOilers,3appgt,haterbehatin,1 point,Mon Jun 22 16:17:04 2015 UTC,Yeah I think that'd be fair. You're right about those other rounds having some potential though.
EdmontonOilers,3appgt,arcticcatherder,2,Mon Jun 22 16:27:44 2015 UTC,"Ya, I know we needed some fixed in the scouting department, but this worries me that so many are going. I would have thought some of them did give us some good picks. I am moreso hoping these are in the pro-scouting area. I feel like the people we trade for or get as free agents etc seem more problematic than the drafting... or am I wrong on this?"
EdmontonOilers,3appgt,parecon,2,Mon Jun 22 17:41:35 2015 UTC,"From the Oil Change vids I recall Frank Musil as one of our Euro scouts, so I'm guessing he had a hand in the Russian picks.  If so, hopefully he sticks around based on Slepyshev and Yakimov alone."
EdmontonOilers,3appgt,tsn123456789,1 point,Mon Jun 22 18:14:09 2015 UTC,My impression was that Slepy and Yakimov were MacT picks. Everyone knew they were better than 3rd and 4th round talent. The risk wasn't from a hockey standpoint but whether they'd come over or not (the Russian factor).

EdmontonOilers,3ak9lw,Icekommander,1 point,Sun Jun 21 05:04:27 2015 UTC,Because you can't pin Lander on McGregor. Lander is actually a talented player under the right coach. Eakins isn't that coach. You get the most talented players possible and they'll flounder under a shit coach
EdmontonOilers,3ak9lw,B0mb-Hands,8,Sun Jun 21 05:13:21 2015 UTC,"Sorry, but doesn't that just prove the point that MacGregor can find talent? The reference to him being in OP's flair by /u/ipooblood to show he's brought in more depth than just Ebs."
EdmontonOilers,3ak9lw,white_franklin,2,Sun Jun 21 14:07:05 2015 UTC,You're arguing the same point. /u/ipooblood is using Lander is an example of solid drafting.

Stu's been gifted with top draft choices and the team still hasn't improved their god awful bottom 6.    Pitlick, Moroz, Hamilton, Martindale and Musil were all terrible picks. You have to hit a homerun with at least some of those picks past the first round in a 7 year span."
EdmontonOilers,3ak9lw,ipooblood,-1,Sun Jun 21 15:09:15 2015 UTC,"Players drafted outside of the 1st usually take 3-4 years to make an impact.

(Maybe Pajaarvi, but that was a weak draft class and he had a great draft year)  Misses Musil #32 Khaira #63 Marco Roy #56 Houck #94 Moroz #32 Perhonen #62 Musil #31 (only because he's been passed over by so many other players, I still think he can be a top 6 one day) Pitlick #31 Hamilton #48 Ewanyk #74 Martindale #61  A common theme amongst the misses is they are two way forwards who seem to put up a fair amount of PIMS."

Plus the 2013 draftees look sweet with Yakimov, Slepyshev, Platzer and Chase. It's too early to call, but we could well end up with 3-5 reasonable depth players from the McGregor years."
EdmontonOilers,3ak9lw,9Bains,1 point,Sun Jun 21 04:39:38 2015 UTC,"First Eberle was 22 overall, hardly a ""depth"" pick, second the Oilers have had plenty of good picks after the first that were mismanaged Hartikainen, and Reider come to mind, and the soon to be departing Marincin. As far as helping the team, there's Lander, of course, but also Simpson, Pitlick, Davidson, Khaira, Laleggia, Yakimov, Slepyshev, and Chase who are all depth picks that could help out within the next couple seasons. MacGregor has hit quite a bit more than people gave him credit for."
EdmontonOilers,3ak9lw,VanPerstrings,1 point,Sun Jun 21 18:57:32 2015 UTC,"Simpson, Pitlick, Davidson, Khaira, Laleggia, Yakimov, Slepyshev, and Chase    Until they prove something in the NHL, the jury is out from my perspective.    Bunz, Hamilton, Olivier Roy all looked good in their draft + 1 seasons."
EdmontonOilers,3ak9lw,9Bains,1 point,Sun Jun 21 19:47:54 2015 UTC,"Pitlick did make the team last season, but got injured. If he gets qualified I think he'll be a decent 3rd liner for the Oilers, which he showed after he returned I thought, but other than him, I agree. I can see Davidson as a 7th defenseman this season assuming we don't resign, or pick up another Aulie.  Those Goalies did show promise, but I think Hamilton's injuries held him back from being considered promising though."

EdmontonOilers,3ak9lw,rundatlife,2,Sun Jun 21 20:57:09 2015 UTC,"I posted MacT's history the other day I think his is actually pretty solid. There was a ton under Kevin Lowe that were just terrible though well except that one time the Blues wanted to move Pronger and he was able to fleece them.   Actually his trade of Pronger to the Ducks was pretty good, what he turned around and did with those pieces was just terrible move after terrible move though."
EdmontonOilers,3ak9lw,ATinyBoatInMyTeacup,3,Sun Jun 21 22:06:08 2015 UTC,"That seems to have been the hallmark of the Oilers trades. Make decent deal, turn them around for shit.

EdmontonOilers,3ak9lw,WobblyHobbly,3,Sun Jun 21 22:19:19 2015 UTC,"Yeah that was a bad one.  Credit to Cogs for turning his game around, he never looked good on wing in Edmonton, he always seemed to me to play the best at centre but wasn't good enough at the responsibilities of a centre to stick there.

EdmontonOilers,3ak9lw,TweetPoster,2,Sun Jun 21 05:25:18 2015 UTC,I could have sworn I read a quote before the Oilers wouldn't be looking at their scouting staff until after the draft.
EdmontonOilers,3ajo0c,envague,21,Sat Jun 20 21:16:50 2015 UTC,So that's Ference's way of making sure he isn't traded away? Just jokes though....  not really though
EdmontonOilers,3ajo0c,IGetComputersPuting,5,Sat Jun 20 21:22:41 2015 UTC,He's not going anywhere without his consent. Including put on waivers.
EdmontonOilers,3ajo0c,haterbehatin,3,Sat Jun 20 22:44:55 2015 UTC,He only had a NMC for the second year of his contract IIRC.
EdmontonOilers,3ajo0c,supertroll1999,5,Sun Jun 21 02:21:00 2015 UTC,I know he has a NMC this is the first I ever heard of it only being for 1 year though. It would be great if that was the case though.
EdmontonOilers,3ajo0c,haterbehatin,15,Sun Jun 21 02:25:14 2015 UTC,"After a game in Guelph, Bassin tried to steer him out a side door and away from a huge crowd. Showing the disposition of an elite player who is conscious of his acclaim, McDavid ignored Bassin and signed autographs for 45 minutes outside in –28 C temperatures.  “He stopped me and said, ‘No, Bass, I was a little boy once, too,’” Bassin recalls. “How many 17– or 18-year-olds, when given an out, would say that? In getting him, the Oilers didn’t just win a lottery, they won the jackpot.”"

He's the opposite of a stereotypical jock. His parents did a great job raising him, and he seems very wise beyond his years. Man am I getting excited, the hype just cannot stop."
EdmontonOilers,3ajo0c,Shottaz83,6,Sun Jun 21 06:34:27 2015 UTC,"He's been exceptional from a young age, he's been groomed for years for this. No telling what he's really like, he could be a giant asshole or he could be the greatest guy in the world, but when in public he's going to put he best face forward.   With these sort of stories he feels a bit like Jonny Towes, which is pretty damn awesome."
EdmontonOilers,3ajo0c,MrTheFinn,16,Sun Jun 21 07:32:44 2015 UTC,I think he should live with Hall and Eberle in the party house.

EdmontonOilers,3ajvo6,ClintonsDix,1 point,Sat Jun 20 23:36:21 2015 UTC,He's the future of the Oilers though!
EdmontonOilers,3aix7f,shweet44722,13,Sat Jun 20 17:11:53 2015 UTC,"Obviously we draft that MacDavidson kid, and then we either trade the 16th pick in a package for a top 4 RHD or we draft Brandon Carlo unless someone that's too good to pass up falls to us. With the 33rd pick we should draft samsonov if he's there or really best player available at that point. If talbot is cheap we trade for him. Some interesting players to look at in other rounds are Ethan Bear, Conor Garland, and Vladimir Tkachev, as is tradition."
EdmontonOilers,3aix7f,ClintonsDix,7,Sat Jun 20 18:46:18 2015 UTC,"Assuming teams not named ""The Oilers"" take players in the order of Bob Mckenzie's list, here are my first and second choices for each position in the first two rounds:  #1. CSP - C - No shit.  HM: Literally impossible for him to have been taken.  #16. Oliver Kylington - LD - He was ranked in the top 15 at one point but has started to fall. From what I've heard his fall completely baffles Euro scouts and fans. Amazing skater with excellent puck movement abilities. One of my favourites from this draft. I think he'd be a great pick at 16 and a steal if he somehow falls to 33 (apparently not out of the question).  HM: Nick Merkley - C/RW - High end play making center. Sounds like a Henrik Sedin-esque player from what I understand. I don't think he gets this far.  #33. Daniel Sprong - RW - Incredibly skilled winger. ""Arguably one of the most skilled players in the draft."" Seems like a good bet with a solid development coach (damn you Grand Rapids!). Also, I took him as a late 1st in NHL14 a year ago because of his awesome name and he turned into a beast.  HM: Dennis Yan - LW -  Solid two-way guy. Listed as a LW but it's implied he's a center? Either way, it sounds like he has a lot of untapped potential. If see him as a (2014-15) Lander-type player.  #57. Mitchell Vande-Sompel - LD - High potential offensive defenceman. Also plays forward. An Eric Karlsson-type player apparently. I get the feeling Detroit selects him. Vande Sompel is such a ""Detroit name"".  HM: Rasmus Andersson - RD - Scouting report makes him sound like another Klefbom. Seems like a really solid defensive player with serious offensive upside. The only reason he's the HM instead of MVS is because I actually watched MVS play (and was impressed).  As you can probably tell, I'm biased towards high potential players as opposed to safe, solid players.  Holy fuck I love the draft. This one could stock us up Red Wings style."
EdmontonOilers,3aix7f,oddspellingofPhreid,5,Sat Jun 20 18:56:19 2015 UTC,I think Anderson would be the better choice if he is still available. We only have 2 RHD in the system (Schultz and Fayne) and he seems to have a lot of upside.
EdmontonOilers,3aix7f,Giggleplex,2,Sat Jun 20 19:05:51 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I had a lot of trouble figuring out who I'd prefer to take.  I like Vande Sompel just slightly more because he seems to have more raw talent but Andersson is a better fit. In the end, they could call out either name and I'd be happy."
EdmontonOilers,3aix7f,oddspellingofPhreid,2,Sat Jun 20 19:09:03 2015 UTC,"This one could stock us up Red Wings style.   If the draft goes your way, I absolutely see this happening. I'm too all-over-the-place to make one of my own but I definitely like your high potential approach and think that if our front office thinks like you we could see one hell of a team being built from this draft year."
EdmontonOilers,3aix7f,foucaultliker,4,Sat Jun 20 21:05:25 2015 UTC,"I'd like Lehner for the right price (3rd and Miller) or there abouts, I wouldn't mind trading a 2nd for Talbot although I'm not at all impressed with the idea of targeting Klein and Talbot for the 16th as I've seen tossed around on /r/hockey.   I like the idea of talking to the Devils for a defenseman but it'd have to be a pick and prospect trade if they're looking for guys to step in this season there's probably not a fit. I like the idea of trying to pick up Spurgeon but again picks and non big name prospects.   I wouldn't mind if every pick other than the McDavid pick was dealt but I also wouldn't mind if every pick was used, no reason to make a deal just to make a deal."
EdmontonOilers,3aix7f,haterbehatin,4,Sat Jun 20 18:48:56 2015 UTC,Klein/Talbot is what the Rags are offering us reportedly
EdmontonOilers,3aix7f,B0mb-Hands,1 point,Sat Jun 20 19:47:17 2015 UTC,Yeah I don't like that idea.   I'm not sure how credible that is because the source from it didn't seem overly credible.  If that was the deal on the table I don't really see the point of it for Edmonton. Klein isin't terrible he's just not a piece I would aim for but I'm in the camp that wants to give Schultz at least another year. That deal would make a lot more sense to me if the plan is to move Schultz.
EdmontonOilers,3aix7f,haterbehatin,2,Sat Jun 20 19:52:12 2015 UTC,CSP - no otter choice (get it?.. ill let myself out) Oliver kylington- i have a feeling he'll turn into a klefbom type of defender in play and time it takes to develop trade for eddie lack. He held his own with a weak defense core in vancouver and god knows we have a weak one even if we add a piece or 2 to it
EdmontonOilers,3aix7f,mojiece,2,Sun Jun 21 15:24:13 2015 UTC,"With the #1 CSP, obviously.  With #16, I'd say Kylington. Only problem with him is that he is, another, leftie."
EdmontonOilers,3aix7f,LuckyCanuck13,1 point,Mon Jun 22 01:41:56 2015 UTC,"I think one of Barzal, Svechnikov, Meier or Rantanen will be there at 16, one of them has to slip because of the depth of the draft. Take whichever one is still there. Barzal is going to be a Patrick Sharp type and the other three are all big strong power forwards. There will be a defenceman available at 33 whether it be Roy, Carlo, Larsson, Carlson etc.   Then trade Montreal's 2nd rounder for Talbot."
EdmontonOilers,3aix7f,gpaine93,1 point,Sat Jun 20 18:05:07 2015 UTC,I want to see an actual mock draft where the Oilers pick Eichel.  I want to see the world burn.

Draft a Dman I dont care who    The rest of the picks can be used on whatever could be desired but thats the plan I would go with if for some reason I ended up with control of the first 4."

EdmontonOilers,3aix7f,tvberkel,1 point,Mon Jun 22 17:58:12 2015 UTC,Me either I dont see talbot as the answer and if we are giving up the 16th pick in a deal with him as the primary target then Id hope to see more back than Talbot and Klein
EdmontonOilers,3aix7f,RoboNerdOK,0,Mon Jun 22 19:19:45 2015 UTC,"Obviously McDavid.   After that, at 16, I think it's Samsonov time. However, it's a big big risk. Goalies are rarely good right away, and some first round goalies never really get good. Therefore, pick BPA. I don't think you can trade that pick for a reasonable return based upon the goalies that are available. Cam Talbot is worth the 33, but an unproven 27 year old is not worth a 16+. After 33, it's a shit show. Trade em all, move em around, at that point it's down to the scouts trying to figure out who Detroit likes."
EdmontonOilers,3aix7f,tvberkel,6,Sat Jun 20 17:16:03 2015 UTC,"I'm firmly in the ""no first round goalies"" camp. That said I'm really torn on the 16th pick. I don't know how to use it to improve the NHL roster within what I think is our window to become a legitimate contender (5 years).   Maybe the best option is a trade. I'm stumped... but maybe that's a good problem to have."
EdmontonOilers,3aix7f,tvberkel,2,Sat Jun 20 19:05:33 2015 UTC,"Are there are particular players you think would be worth going after? Jones with the 16th+, offer sheet Hamilton, trade for Bernier or Lack, something like that?"
EdmontonOilers,3aix7f,haterbehatin,2,Sat Jun 20 17:22:40 2015 UTC,"Jones is even less proven than Talbot,and LA really shields their goalies. Look at Scrivens when he came over from LA. His numbers were skyhigh, but behind our defence he crumbled like feta cheese.  Of the goalies available, none of them are worth a mid first round pick in a deep draft. Vancouver will trade Lack so that they don't lose Markstrom, and Toronto will trade Bernier because they're exploding everything. You can get those guys for a second round pick and, say, a current AHL defenceman. You just have to wait a bit.  Now let's say the Oilers don't get their goalie at the draft, there's plenty of time after that to get one. Free agency, trades, etc.   Don't offer sheet Hamilton. Not worth it. Boston will certainly match. Sure they'll be in cap hell, but how does that help the Oilers? They'll trade Krejci to the Flames as a big ""fuck you"" to Edmonton."
EdmontonOilers,3aix7f,notsoyoungpadawan,3,Sat Jun 20 17:30:07 2015 UTC,"Shit, sorry, meant Seth Jones, defenceman! I should really clarify that more often...."
EdmontonOilers,3aix7f,koho_66,2,Sat Jun 20 17:31:41 2015 UTC,"Oh! I can't see Nashville giving him up. Why would they? That would be like us giving a team Draisaitl for the 16th and a prospect. Same spot... They have Weber and Josi, we (will) have Nuge and McDavid."
EdmontonOilers,3aix7f,vanillaacid,1 point,Sat Jun 20 17:38:03 2015 UTC,They might be interested in something around Draisaitl plus for Jones emphasis on might.

All the best to Nellie. Hope to see him coaching in the NHL soon but hopefully it's in the east so I can cheer for him guilt-free."
EdmontonOilers,3ag13l,teddybadman,4,Fri Jun 19 22:21:41 2015 UTC,"To be (un)fair, Nelly wasn't interviewed because MacT wasn't looking for a head Coach, and subsequently fired the coach with the most success in the past 6 seasons of Oilers hockey."
EdmontonOilers,3ag13l,9Bains,3,Sat Jun 20 02:00:50 2015 UTC,"Yea although Mac-T did make some decent trades, he made a lot of really stupid decisions no experienced GM would have made. Hiring a rookie coach with 0 NHL experience to lead a very young team was a huge mistake, especially considering he didn't even speak to anyone else, he just hired him instantly. Look at how that worked out for us... Eakins somehow made one of the worst teams in the league even worse. I didn't even know it was possible to regress even more. The players mostly disliked him, as a lot of players have said. Some of the players who left even said his practices were terrible compared to other teams they played for. On top of all of that some players just flat out didn't want to play here with him as coach. Look at Belov for example, he wasn't a great player, but the guy straight up said with Eakins as coach he didn't want to play for us. He also handled our young guys very poorly by benching them for every mistake they made instead of telling them how to get better and putting them back out. Man am I so glad hes gone, and Mac-T is no longer making those calls. I mean look at Chia, he came in and took a solid month looking for a new coach and interviewing several people."
EdmontonOilers,3ag13l,Shottaz83,1 point,Sat Jun 20 00:25:55 2015 UTC,I had no idea that Nelly didn't even get an interview with MacT. My respect for MacT has really been diminished by the way he handled the Oilers. Terrible.
EdmontonOilers,3ag13l,RoboNerdOK,5,Fri Jun 19 23:53:45 2015 UTC,"That was a good read. I was sure I had heard previously that he was always interested only in being a head coach, but of course hoped he would stay on with Todd2. I thought it was really cool of him to also give Nelson questions to think about to determine if he wanted to work as an assistant for him or not. It sounds like Nelson could have been convinced but TMac helped Nelson figure out which direction would make him happy in the long run. Totally sucks about losing him here, but glad he went to Detroit's affiliate where he will be treated very well."

EdmontonOilers,3af9gp,But-Seriously-Though,13,Fri Jun 19 17:45:50 2015 UTC,Side note: Drai just tweeted last week that he was glad to be back home in Cologne. After spending all his time with Yak-Yak in Edmonton last summer and going through a long playoff run with Kelowna I would have guessed he would want to chill out in Germany for a longer while. If he's already coming back for the draft maybe this is a sign that he's planning on sticking around again and preparing for camp – which shows an incredible level of commitment.   It would fucking suck if he got traded on the draft floor.
EdmontonOilers,3af9gp,envague,3,Fri Jun 19 17:57:43 2015 UTC,"Yea I saw that as well, but the Oilers twitter account confirmed he would be at the party. Drai is a very committed guy, and I think he's going to have an amazing camp this year after how well he played for Kelowna.   Also they better not trade him, at least not right now. Maybe later down the road when the cap is more of an issue, but right now trading him would be a mistake."

Higher take home pay if you play in Alberta was seen as a positive when compared to other places. But, players have to pay taxes for what ever tax jurisdiction they play in.

EdmontonOilers,3aerc4,Berding,3,Fri Jun 19 16:42:03 2015 UTC,These guys have experts at minimizing their taxed owed.  They'll be ok.
EdmontonOilers,3aerc4,But-Seriously-Though,3,Fri Jun 19 15:51:33 2015 UTC,"First off, the way taxes are calculated for pro athletes is extremely complicated.  It's not based on what team they play for exclusively, but where the games are played.  So when completing one of these returns they have to pay taxes in multiple jurisdictions to start with, so a tax increase in one place is already mitigated due to the spread of where income is paid.  Second off, from a personal tax point of view, Alberta has one of the lowest tax rates in the country for high income earners (flat 10%) and for simple terms if it goes up to 12% it would still be lower that  all other provinces with hockey teams.  (13.1% in Ontario, 16.8 in BC, Quebec is to complicated to explain due to additional rules with federal rates)."

EdmontonOilers,3adaqs,tsn123456789,11,Fri Jun 19 04:33:17 2015 UTC,Bob Mckenzie's latest draft list has these guys in the top 60:  19th Ilya Samsonov  35th  Mackenzie Blackwood  47th Daniel Vladar  51st Callum Booth  I reckon we should pass on Samsonov but consider Blackwood with our 33rd as obviously a 16th pick is far more valuable and thus we would be incurring more risk by taking a goalie with that pick.
EdmontonOilers,3adaqs,Colotech,11,Fri Jun 19 05:39:19 2015 UTC,"Blackwood had a 3.09 GAA and .906 sv%, I think there are better impact skaters at 33 or even flipping it for Talbot is better than Blackwood."
EdmontonOilers,3adaqs,wilyquixote,3,Fri Jun 19 05:50:10 2015 UTC,"Save percentage and GAA is a pretty dangerous way of evaluating a goaltender.  Save percentage in particular can fluctuate year to year on a significant basis - look at the difference in save percentage with Carey Price from his draft to his draft + 1 year.  Practically the same shitty team, practically the same mediocre record, huge drop in save percentage.    But despite putting up a .906 sv% in his draft + 1 year, Price turned out okay.    I don't know enough to recommend or disavow Blackwood, but his statline doesn't really clarify that."
EdmontonOilers,3adaqs,shweet44722,2,Fri Jun 19 06:33:28 2015 UTC,"The issue is without considering those stats (sv%), you have to evaluate the quality of shots he's facing, which isn't an option with the availability of CHL stats.  Aside from that sv% is actually better for rating goaltenders than GAA. A number of analytics experts have stated previously that they don't like how dependent GAA can be on the team they're playing for. There can be nights where you'll stop 35 shots but let 3 in. In a vacuum, you have a 3.00 GAA but a .914 sv%. That's an average save %, but an above (generally) acceptable GAA for a starting goaltender.  Edit: For context"

As an aside, I agree we shouldn't disregard Blackwood but if all we have to go on is his stats, which is true for the moment, then it's not encouraging with him. He's still young though of course."

EdmontonOilers,3adaqs,shweet44722,1 point,Fri Jun 19 07:20:31 2015 UTC,"I'm simply stating the fact that without evaluating stats in situations like these, you're severely handicapping yourself, especially if you're not going to use sv% and when looking at goaltenders in a league like the CHL that don't really keep track of stats aside from the basics."
EdmontonOilers,3adaqs,wilyquixote,1 point,Fri Jun 19 07:22:23 2015 UTC,"Ok. I'm stating that sv% is still a poor way to do evaluate, with which you seem to agree (certainly the article you posted does, which literally refers to as sv% as ""slightly better"" than GAA, which it calls to scap).  So where does that leave us?  Watching the games, listening to scouts, and reserving opinions.  Based on the latter two, I wouldn't write off Blackwood at 33 based on his save percentage.  That's all.       I don't know what you mean by ""severely handicapping"" yourself (or myself)."
EdmontonOilers,3adaqs,shweet44722,1 point,Fri Jun 19 07:32:04 2015 UTC,"What I mean is that through all this, we're attempting to evaluate Blackwood as a potential draft pick, right? Since we both agree GAA is crap, and we haven't seen him play enough for that to matter, IMO we should use sv% to evaluate his performance, albeit with some prudence.  So while not writing him off, I wouldn't go near him until late 2nd-early 3rd round with those stats. But we're also not scouts, who would know a hell of a lot more than we could ever hope to and ranked him there for a reason...  Edit: By ""yourself"" I just mean anyone looking at the stats for him in a similar context to how we are at the moment, sorry."

EdmontonOilers,3adaqs,shweet44722,2,Fri Jun 19 16:01:48 2015 UTC,Talked to some of my friends who follow the OHL a lot closer than me and their opinion is that the goalies this year blows which is another reason he doesn't trust a lot of the offensive numbers from guys in the OHL this year. He might be 11th statistically but that's not really saying much if the entire crop was weak.

Not sure there's a whole lot of point to it, but interesting piece I found was that out of the 20 goalies drafted in 2007, only 3 ever played a single NHL game. One goalie played 1 game, another played 11 (York) and the final goaltender is Scott Darling, who's currently played 14."

Clear losses: Petry trade, maybe not moving Hemsky earlier?  The rest are kind of a push, you could argue the way Dubnyk played this year that that's also a loss but I think getting a roster player for a goalie with a sub .900 save percentage is decent. You could also argue some of the other push trades were pretty solid.   His trading record seems pretty decent to me. Some of his contract signings on the other hand..."
EdmontonOilers,3acyvj,Starsky686,6,Fri Jun 19 03:19:24 2015 UTC,"Would you call the Horcoff trade a win? I don't recall a lot of winning before the trade, but certainly less wins after his departure.  So unless we count all the bad moves as a win because of the direction the Oilers are headed in finally I don't like the Horcoff move. Lost a veteran centre didn't get shit for him."
EdmontonOilers,3acyvj,koho_66,3,Fri Jun 19 05:43:48 2015 UTC,I'd say it was a win just because at that point he was despised for his contract and it was time for the team and him to move on from each other.   Moving that much cap without having to take on junk cap is a pretty good trade in my view.   That and he wasn't that good at that point of his career he was a third line centre (at best) on a 1st line centre's salary. I liked Horcoff I thought his contributions got minimized because of his deal but I think it was a good trade.

EdmontonOilers,3acyvj,Ferocian,5,Sun Jun 21 04:04:27 2015 UTC,"I remember him getting slammed on that Smid deal but its looking ok now. In such a tight cap era, Smid is on a pretty expensive contract for what he is. Bonus pts too for player goodwill that he send Smid to the closest city to Edmonton.   In addition to the bad contract signings we have to hang the Eakins signing on MacT too. For whatever reason Eakins was just not the coach for us and ultimate responsibility lies with MacT for picking him."
EdmontonOilers,3acyvj,ClintonsDix,1 point,Fri Jun 19 06:11:43 2015 UTC,"Yeah Eakins was definitely a mistake. I just see comments frequently along the lines of good thing MacT is gone because he would've traded Yakupov for a pair of 3rd pairing defensemen when his trading history suggests he wasn't actually bad in terms of trades.   The Smid trade looked bad at the time, I thought it wasn't good but at this point getting rid of Smid's contract and Roy for a promising player in Brossoit even if he doesn't pan out was a good trade."
EdmontonOilers,3acyvj,envague,2,Fri Jun 19 14:11:57 2015 UTC,"Yeah MacT's trade history actually shows if anything him being over-prudent if you're looking for negatives. He was very cautious not to give up too much in terms of assets. If you want the real story with bad management with the oilers, look at the time under Tambellini. Give up Erik Cole for Patrick O Sullivan? Lubomir Visnovski for Ryan Whitney? How about giving up Brodziak for basically nothing?  I actually just found a stat on this that's pretty damning. NHL games played by players traded away by Tambellini after the trade: 2237. Games by players gained by Tambellini post-trade: 1454. The Oilers were also the easier team to make statistically speaking. So, MacT was stuck trying to clean up Tambo's mess.   By the raw measure of games played, the Oilers were the huge loser overall.  The players traded off have played 54% more NHL games than the ones acquired, and if you only count games played for the Oilers that difference soars to a shocking 133%. (Playoff games are excluded, though naturally those would make the situation appear even worse.)  Even before taking into account the quality of those games — e.g. 1 GP for Erik Cole >>> 1 GP for Patrick O’Sullivan — that’s a huge deficit that reflects badly on Tambellini and by extension, on the Oilers pro scouting department.   If that doesn't convince you, not a single NHL player acquired by Tambellini remains on the Oilers roster today. The only exceptions to that weren't players, they were draft picks. One good and one middling in quality (Klefbom and Marincin)."
EdmontonOilers,3acyvj,koho_66,1 point,Sat Jun 20 00:09:34 2015 UTC,"I think that part is hard to judge because given the situation the Oilers were in when he was in power I think if he would've been aggressive he likely would've lost trades.   Only now does the team have picks and 2nd tier prospects of value, at the beginning of his term it was still a situation of the kids that shouldn't be traded and then basically nothing."
EdmontonOilers,3acyvj,shweet44722,7,Sat Jun 20 00:12:04 2015 UTC,Found this when I was looking for Glen Sathers trade history to see if he lives up to his reputation as a master of fleecing teams.   Thought people would be interested in checking out Chiarelli's trades as the Bruins GM.

EdmontonOilers,3acyvj,shweet44722,3,Fri Jun 19 02:41:22 2015 UTC,"I only looked at his recent ones here's his link and the source link.  Personally I found Sather's recent deals to be not that great. I don't think the Yandle one was bad but the St. Louis was really bad. The Klein trade worked out for them and Brassard I think played better in New York.   I don't think he deserves the reputation of a guy who will definitely win every trade though, he has a few clear losses, a couple wins and some solid hockey trades."
EdmontonOilers,3acyvj,shweet44722,4,Fri Jun 19 02:48:11 2015 UTC,"He was great for the Oilers - CuJo, Guerin, Weight, etc."
EdmontonOilers,3acyvj,shweet44722,2,Fri Jun 19 03:14:31 2015 UTC,I was only looking at his Rangers history just because there seems to be a feeling that if the Oilers want Talbot they're going to get fleeced.
EdmontonOilers,3acyvj,koho_66,1 point,Fri Jun 19 03:21:00 2015 UTC,"Peter Klima, Bill Ranford, Dave Brown, the list is endless, Craig Simpson was pretty good also."
EdmontonOilers,3acyvj,shweet44722,4,Sun Jun 21 03:53:19 2015 UTC,"Forgot how bad that Boychuck trade was, and considering how good he was this past season...damn. That right there is exactly why you don't get yourself in a cap crunch.  Timmy Thomas trade was pretty good, all things considered.  That Hendo for Boychuck trade though? Daaaamn Colorado, ya done messed up.  At the end of all this I'm not sure what to make of it....Chiarelli wasn't kidding when he wasn't afraid to make moves, which is good. Sitting on your ass and doing nothing is a recipe for disaster. Hindsight is 20/20, a number of these trades are good, and some are bad. Seems like most GMs at any rate, some trades work out while others fall apart."
EdmontonOilers,3acyvj,mcbordes,3,Fri Jun 19 02:44:53 2015 UTC,"Yeah he has a nice mix of oooh that's not good, hey wow he did really well there, that's surprising (Soderberg for Toivenen) and a fuck ton of meh that trade didn't make a difference either way."
EdmontonOilers,3acyvj,koho_66,3,Fri Jun 19 02:49:38 2015 UTC,"I think there's a disconcerting lot of giving away a good player for a lesser player in this list.  Of course, some of those are driven by outside concerns (like the aforementioned Boychuk-out trade), but that's also true of a lot of his good trades (like escaping the Thomas caphit, or Brian Burke refusing to really leverage the offer-sheet in order to get Kessel).  Look at how good players like Wheeler and Sobotka and Colborne have become, and man, I hope Chiarelli learned some lessons from sending these guys away but signing Chris Kelly to long-term deals at $3 million per."
EdmontonOilers,3acyvj,ksieben,1 point,Fri Jun 19 04:43:47 2015 UTC,I think there was some contract issue with Wheeler but I don't remember the exact situation. Colborne is a little tough to be too critical for because I don't think he was much of anything in Toronto either and is only now catching on as a decent player with Calgary.   He did definitely have some whiffs aside from the big ones with moves like the Versteeg trade.
EdmontonOilers,3acyvj,B0mb-Hands,2,Fri Jun 19 05:28:30 2015 UTC,"Yup, that's a pretty good summary I'd say. I suppose at the end of the day there weren't toooo many devastatingly bad trades, but man when Chia makes a bad trade, he goes all out."
EdmontonOilers,3acyvj,B0mb-Hands,2,Fri Jun 19 02:51:41 2015 UTC,Yeah that Boychuk one really stands out because it's from a situation that they put themselves in. The more moves Benning makes the more I wonder if there's some truth to the notion that he is largely responsible for the Bruins cap issues.   I'm hopeful that that's the case but maybe that's just unrealistic wishful thinking of an Oilers fan who doesn't want the team to end up in cap hell.
EdmontonOilers,3acyvj,Colyer,3,Fri Jun 19 03:01:13 2015 UTC,"Agreed. I'm surprised they didn't even force the Isles to give up a single 1st, Snow done good. Yeah, it definitely will be interesting to see how this offseason and the following season goes for the Bruins. If some more bad trades are made/they're still making poor cap decisions than we get a bit more of an indication that maybe Chiarelli didn't have as much to do with it as we thought.  Maybe, but we're all thinking the same thing at any rate. Let's hope that if Chia was primarily responsible, that at least he learned his lesson."
EdmontonOilers,3acyvj,Ferocian,3,Fri Jun 19 03:04:04 2015 UTC,"Yeah I want to see what a top 6 of Hall, Eberle, Yakupov, McDavid, Nuge and Draisaitl/Slepyshev/whoever can do with a decent d core.   If it has to be broken up I want a hockey trade not a signed too many 30 plus scrubs to unmovable contracts trade."
EdmontonOilers,3acyvj,Ferocian,2,Fri Jun 19 03:25:59 2015 UTC,"Can't imagine Edmonton fans will take a trade of any of the top 6 very well at this point, but if it's a poor trade it'll go over even worse."

EdmontonOilers,3ac5pv,AlleyBj,4,Fri Jun 19 03:17:54 2015 UTC,Not sure why I expected anything else.   Can a hockey player please say something sometime?
EdmontonOilers,3ac5pv,ghostcoins,10,Fri Jun 19 02:27:08 2015 UTC,"....what did you expect him to say?  ""Nah fuck that kid, he's a little shit and he's gonna come in here and ruin our losing streak""  or  ""Holy shitbiscuits I can't wait, we're all nothing compared to him and he's going to demolish everything in his way""  There's a time and a place for the dramatic and funny, but interviews aren't always them. There's a good reason behind media training, and it's not to make the players boring but to prevent PR disasters and backlash from sponsors, fans and management. When you play for the team you don't just represent yourself, you represent the organization as a whole. Saying something outside the box is a good way to soil your reliability and reputation as a player with responsibility, let alone get you more media attention than you could ever ask for."

Dead serious people thinking that Hall, Eberle, Nuge, or Yak for Talbot is a reasonable trade. These people get to vote and drive cars, unbelievable."
EdmontonOilers,3aaogl,Starsky686,12,Thu Jun 18 17:44:28 2015 UTC,Why is Calgary interested?
EdmontonOilers,3aaogl,Arunatic5,3,Thu Jun 18 16:01:14 2015 UTC,Hiller is 33 and has one more year on his deal. Ramo is on pace for UFA. Probably want to pass the torch.
EdmontonOilers,3aaogl,oddspellingofPhreid,2,Thu Jun 18 16:48:40 2015 UTC,Ah! That makes sense.
EdmontonOilers,3aaogl,Arunatic5,2,Thu Jun 18 17:37:54 2015 UTC,They have Ortio as well though and he will have to clear waivers.
EdmontonOilers,3aaogl,haterbehatin,4,Thu Jun 18 17:52:10 2015 UTC,"Joni Ortio doesn't seem very impressive to me. Given the choice I'd much rather stick my apples in the Talbot basket than the Ortio basket.  Besides, when is an extra NHL options a bad thing?"
EdmontonOilers,3aaogl,oddspellingofPhreid,2,Thu Jun 18 17:56:31 2015 UTC,I'm just going by their fans being high on him. If he's as good as they believe seems unnecessary to risk losing him to give up assets for a guy who might be available next summer for free.   Then again every fan has overrated at least one prospect who they thought might turn out.
EdmontonOilers,3aaogl,haterbehatin,2,Thu Jun 18 17:59:20 2015 UTC,"I just did a quick perusal of his sv% and GAA. He only really has one AHL season that suggests starter to me (2013-14). At the very least, he won't be a reliable starter for another three years at least."
EdmontonOilers,3aaogl,oddspellingofPhreid,1 point,Thu Jun 18 18:12:54 2015 UTC,He's expecting to back up for the flames next year otherwise they'd be forced to put him in waivers which they won't.

EdmontonOilers,3aaogl,Hyperion4,9,Mon Jun 22 10:21:25 2015 UTC,With talks heating up it sounds like the trade will go down by the end of the week.  This off season is going to be fun as hell!

EdmontonOilers,3aaogl,YAK_ATTACK_CALL_911,9,Thu Jun 18 17:25:11 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't mind picking him up, but not if the price is a first rounder. There are other goalies on the block and a few set to hit UFA as well."
EdmontonOilers,3aaogl,notsoyoungpadawan,3,Thu Jun 18 17:47:03 2015 UTC,Whom would you rather have? Genuinely curious because I've seen a couple of these type of posts around but nobody ever seems to specify who they'd rather we went after.
EdmontonOilers,3aaogl,B0mb-Hands,1 point,Thu Jun 18 20:20:31 2015 UTC,"Any proven NHL starter. Bernier, Niemi, Miller, Lehtonen, Anderson. Someone who actually has experience playing 40+ games"
EdmontonOilers,3aaogl,notsoyoungpadawan,1 point,Thu Jun 18 20:49:14 2015 UTC,"Bernier would be a really good signing, but I feel like we'd have to give up the #16 pick to get him, which I don't really want to do, especially because Bernier isn't really worth that pick in this draft.  Niemi's is going to be Scrivens 2.0 in this team. San Jose have a much better defence and he still hasn't been anywhere near the top. Lehtonen is the same.  I doubt we will be able to get Anderson from Ottawa for a resonable price, and given the fact that he's 34, I really don't want us to overspend on him.  Given these factors, I feel Talbot is our best option. He's cheap and actually has the potential to be a world class goalie. His sample size is also much larger than Scrivens'."

EdmontonOilers,3aaogl,paul-mccartney,1 point,Thu Jun 18 19:37:07 2015 UTC,Why Calgary? Wat.  Hiller and Ramo seems like a pretty good tandem for at least a few more years.

EdmontonOilers,3a7l5x,callmenighthawk,15,Wed Jun 17 21:17:54 2015 UTC,"The Dallas, Toronto and LA ones are laughable. For NYR, I'd rather give up the later second rounder for whichever goalie the Oilers target (unless they can grab Gibson I guess).   The Vancouver one actually doesn't seem too too bad though. I'd like to see Yak play with a real centre for a whole season, but I'm convinced Lack is a starting goalie.  I probably wouldn't do any of them though."
EdmontonOilers,3a7l5x,gpaine93,5,Wed Jun 17 21:25:03 2015 UTC,"In a draft like this, there's so much quality.  More picks > higher picks. Trade down not up imo.  two 10% chances vs one 15% chance."
EdmontonOilers,3a7l5x,oddspellingofPhreid,0,Wed Jun 17 21:51:10 2015 UTC,"Could not disagree more. It doesn't progress linearly, there is usually a big drop off of talent after the first 10-15 picks or so. After that, the chances of really contributing in the NHL at a high level decrease drastically."
EdmontonOilers,3a7l5x,kapacj,4,Wed Jun 17 22:47:57 2015 UTC,"Here's the thing. Experts are saying that there isn't really a huge drop off this draft after the top 10 or so until the late second round. The top 100 players list is absolutely crazy this year with kids posting >ppg into the triple digits. The more 1st, 2nd and 3rd round picks we can get the better (within reason)."
EdmontonOilers,3a7l5x,oddspellingofPhreid,5,Thu Jun 18 00:11:58 2015 UTC,"Personal thoughts.  Trade 1. Only players I'm interested in is JVR or Reilly. One is too expensive following a poor season, and the other is not in play.  Trade 2. lol  Trade 3. I like this one. It's not about Lack (who could start btw). It's about Edler who is arguably the Nuck's best or 2nd best (Tanev) defender atm. He's only 29 and at a cap hit of $5M. Maybe we can ask for salary retain to even the trade?  Trade 4. lol  Trade 5. I'm willing to wager our 57th for Talbot. Perhaps give them Scrivens in return to sweeten the pot. Perhaps 79th and Scrivens with half salary retained (1.25M). Ensures they get a servicable back up.  I'd do trades 3 and 5 if we (myself included) can work them out. We'd lose Yak and Scrivens, but we'd get 2 goalies, and a top 2 defenceman."
EdmontonOilers,3a7l5x,Arunatic5,1 point,Wed Jun 17 22:20:55 2015 UTC,"I think 3 and 5 would be the only ones worth doing, I wouldn't do both though. If you wanted a 2nd goalie I think it'd make more sense to go after Lehner.   You'd have to find a right winger in trade or free agency though because the Oilers are really thin down the right side."
EdmontonOilers,3a7l5x,haterbehatin,2,Wed Jun 17 23:42:49 2015 UTC,"I'll ask, but with Lehner, I'm guessing they'll still want Yak while still only giving up a 1st or something else that doesn't come to value of this trade."
EdmontonOilers,3a7l5x,Arunatic5,2,Thu Jun 18 00:01:19 2015 UTC,"I think Lehner is worth at most a 2nd round pick, I'd like to see Chiarelli send a 3rd and a prospect like Miller for him.  The mock draft is harder because Sens fans seem to crazily overrate the value of their goaltenders and think Anderson plus Cowen gets them Taylor Hall."
EdmontonOilers,3a7l5x,haterbehatin,10,Thu Jun 18 00:18:40 2015 UTC,I think Talbot for #33 is a decent deal.
EdmontonOilers,3a7l5x,TheTravellingMan,7,Wed Jun 17 21:43:01 2015 UTC,Try shopping Teddy Purcell fam
EdmontonOilers,3a7l5x,myniggagotammo,9,Wed Jun 17 23:06:36 2015 UTC,"Trade 1   We shouldn't be interested in any of those players. Kessel and Phaneuf consume too much cap space, and Polak, Robidas and JVR don't have high enough ceilings to pursue.    Trade 2   It isn't worth giving up 16 and 33 to trade up 3 spots   Trade 3   you can get more for Yak I think. Not terrible but Edler isn't really all that interesting. We should be targeting younger guys. I think selling low on Yak is a bad idea.   Trade 4   Lehtonen had a horrible year and isn't worth 16.   Trade 5   This one might be interesting but it concerns me that Talbot is 27 and is only now being thought of a potential starter."
EdmontonOilers,3a7l5x,kapacj,4,Wed Jun 17 22:02:34 2015 UTC,Edler is only 29.
EdmontonOilers,3a7l5x,Arunatic5,12,Wed Jun 17 22:14:18 2015 UTC,"Edler is also on a ridiculously good contract for an excellent defender who has a howizter and a NTC.  I think we, Oiler fans, are hugely undervaluing Edler."
EdmontonOilers,3a7l5x,parecon,2,Wed Jun 17 22:43:29 2015 UTC,"I imagine we undervalue players of rivals teams a bit, but we're getting that top 2 defencemen we so desperately need. Combine with a counteroffer to retain some salary, we can offer sheet Hamilton, and solidify our D-core for at least 2-3 years."
EdmontonOilers,3a7l5x,Arunatic5,2,Thu Jun 18 00:06:51 2015 UTC,And I still think we should target younger defenseman to establish a defensive core we can build around.
EdmontonOilers,3a7l5x,kapacj,3,Wed Jun 17 22:34:55 2015 UTC,"We have plenty of young defencemen that can eventually become top 2 or solid top 4 defencemen. The one thing we lack is bonafide top 2 defencemen. Other than Hamiton, there aren't any young top 2 D-men available. I would rather get Edler giving time for Klefbom and Nurse to become the top 2 in 2-3 years."
EdmontonOilers,3a7l5x,Arunatic5,3,Thu Jun 18 00:04:46 2015 UTC,"Goalies dont really hit their prime until 26 or 27, your gonna be hard pressed to find many in the NHL right now younger than that. Especially starters"
EdmontonOilers,3a7l5x,But-Seriously-Though,1 point,Wed Jun 17 22:38:05 2015 UTC,"So his prime is a fringe starter? There's lots of goalies who would make more sense.    Winnipeg has too many young goalies and could look to deal one of Hutch or Comrie.  Tampa has Bishop and could possibly look to move Vasilevskiy.  Boston has Rask in net and could look to move Subban.  Detroit has Howard and could move Mrazek Vancouver also has a surplus of goalies.   To me, a 27 year old goalie who is only one year removed from his rookie season isn't that interesting."
EdmontonOilers,3a7l5x,kapacj,2,Wed Jun 17 22:45:38 2015 UTC,"no no no! this is why I have warmed up to the idea of talbot is because hes already developed, These younger names that your throwing out are all A, Going to cost way more than we should be willing to pay in trade. B, they are all way to young and still need another 2-3 years to develop in most cases (mrazek is the exception but GFL getting him from detroit for a price less than your first born child) we dont need a goalie that we will have to develop, not only because we tend to be terrible at developing goalies but because we need an NHL ready goaltender who is better than scrivens now or else we are going to be a bottom feeder team in the NHL again even with CSP and the rest of the young guns up front."
EdmontonOilers,3a7l5x,But-Seriously-Though,1 point,Wed Jun 17 22:53:00 2015 UTC,"That's true for some of them, but not all. Lots of those guys were playing in the NHL last year, and I forgot about guys like Allen in St. Louis and Gibson or Anderson in Aneheim. I think we just have different strategies that we think would be best.   Talbot could be a good guy for a few years, but you still need a long term option at the position."
EdmontonOilers,3a7l5x,kapacj,2,Wed Jun 17 23:07:27 2015 UTC,"I don't disagree on the talbot point because im not totally sold that a guy with 1 season NHL experience is the answer either, my opposition to this point is mostly that I don't think we should go young here, we should get someone proven"

EdmontonOilers,3a7l5x,But-Seriously-Though,2,Wed Jun 17 22:18:38 2015 UTC,"I actually like the deal with Dallas I dont know what everyone else might think but lehtonen with salary retained is a good deal. However I would try to squeeze more out of them draft pick wise get another 2nd or 3rd rounder  If all you have to give up for talbot is 33rd than do it, I was of the opinion that Talbot is to big of a gamble but I have been convinced otherwise, especially if thats the cost"
EdmontonOilers,3a7l5x,shweet44722,3,Wed Jun 17 22:36:30 2015 UTC,"Lehtonen with salary retained is a good deal for like a 2nd and a 4th/5th. That 16th is worth a metric shit load this draft and Schneider went for a 9th overall, coming off a good year. Lehtonen played like absolute dog crap this past year so his selling point should be lower, not higher. Whoever is doing Dallas' trade either thinks Lehtonen is a highly sought after commodity or is trying to fool themselves by playing hardball. The 16th overall with 7.5% salary retained is a joke.  That comes off strong, but if the Oilers ever did that deal I'd be livid. Lehtonen isn't a bad goalie but that 16th is way too much to pay for any goalie actually available right now, let alone one coming off a season where he was just awful."
EdmontonOilers,3a7l5x,Arunatic5,2,Thu Jun 18 02:13:21 2015 UTC,"Also it's a buyers market for keepers. Dallas, NYR, Vancouver, Ottawa, and possibly Anaheim are selling keepers while only Edmonton, San Jose, and Buffalo are buying."
EdmontonOilers,3a7l5x,shweet44722,2,Thu Jun 18 03:25:37 2015 UTC,That too.
EdmontonOilers,3a7l5x,shweet44722,2,Thu Jun 18 04:15:06 2015 UTC,"Dallas...wtf. Seriously? Like for real? What the hell.  Edit: Like the Talbot deal, maybe try to bargain for the Montreal's 2nd and a later round pick instead of the 33rd, but at least it's not terrible. The Nucks trade is honestly kind of intriguing. Edler is a good defenseman and Lack will be a solid goaltender one day, arguably the best of the 3 goaltenders they have in Vancouver at the moment."
EdmontonOilers,3a7l5x,shweet44722,2,Thu Jun 18 02:08:07 2015 UTC,"Yeah aha, I thought maybe Montreal's 2nd and one of our d prospects.. But I think they forgot how old and what a monstrosity Lehtonen's contract is"
EdmontonOilers,3a7l5x,dacanadian,2,Thu Jun 18 02:10:48 2015 UTC,"I'd say picks alone even, Lehtonen's stock is at an all time low.  They must have because that's just...wow. That's like saying ""Nikitin for Petry please""."
EdmontonOilers,3a7l5x,Arunatic5,2,Thu Jun 18 02:17:04 2015 UTC,"The Vancouver deal is the most interesting.   Edler: Those saying that Edler is old and not good enough are wrong. He's 29 and is a #1/2 defensemen. He's not Brent Seabrook, He's not Duncan Keith. But he's a good defenseman who can play in all situations and is signed until he's 32 at a 5 mil cap hit. That's good value for that kind of guy. You won't get that unless you rob another GM blind.   Lack: Lack isn't amazing. But he looked as much like a #1 goalie as any of the other guys we're looking at. And we don't lose the 33rd for Talbot, who had very similar stats to Lack behind a weaker D.  Yakapov: This is more than generous for what Yakapov's value is right now (read: as low as it's ever been). That doesn't mean you should trade him, only that if anyone thinks we could get a better deal than this ATM they are kidding themselves.  I think this deal breaks down too ways. Either you think that Yakapov is too valuable to give up on at this point. Or, you realize that we NEED capable defense and a goalie. This deal more or less solves both of those issues and we didn't give up any drafts picks or any other assets.   I go with the second option because I don't think it's good for our kids to play in front of the kind of defense we have now. We don't need more potential, we need a foundation. And to get good defensemen we're either going to have to overpay in free agency, if they even wanted to come here, or give up serious assets in a trade. In this trade, we're giving up one asset (though, a good one at that) and we plug two of our biggest holes."

EdmontonOilers,3a7l5x,bigfatphony,1 point,Thu Jun 18 00:23:55 2015 UTC,II feel like the Nucks deal addresses our biggest weaknesses and puts us in the best position to compete in the coming season while taking some pressure off our youth on the blueline. Salary retained or a better pick would be icing on the cake but I would strongly consider this one either way. Also I like how it doesn't require us to give up 33.  That pick seems to be undervalued around here with CSP on the way. Though expendable it should be treated like a mid first.

EdmontonOilers,3a41c8,AlleyBj,13,Wed Jun 17 01:59:24 2015 UTC,He's making the team this year. AHL is great if/when people need it but he's one of the few young guys who's actually NHL ready.
EdmontonOilers,3a41c8,Ferocian,14,Wed Jun 17 05:50:58 2015 UTC,"I honestly don't see why not. He was a beast in junior, playing at an extremely high level for that peer group. Looking at the 2013 draft class, everyone else in the top 10 is already playing in the NHL. Don't get me wrong, I think it's good that Nurse was given the extra time in junior, but barring the acquisition of like 3 legitimate NHL defensemen this off-season, I think Nurse makes the Oilers for season opener."
EdmontonOilers,3a41c8,BorschtFace,6,Wed Jun 17 06:47:24 2015 UTC,"Hell, he was major part of pretty much the most dominant Canadian World Junior team since the 2005 team with Weber, Seabrook, Phaneuf and Crosby just to name a few.  I think that right there paints a very strong picture of him in relation to his peers. He'll be a stud in the NHL I'm sure."
EdmontonOilers,3a41c8,AlleyBj,3,Wed Jun 17 16:39:11 2015 UTC,I hope you're right. Even just having him play with Fayne as the third pairing to start off would be nice. It all depends how he does in camp I suppose. Hopefully he comes out strong.

EdmontonOilers,3a41c8,IGetComputersPuting,17,Wed Jun 17 03:13:04 2015 UTC,"That isn't the type of muscle that = strength   Well first thing, there are 3 types of muscle (Smooth, Skeletal, Cardiac). What we're talking about here is Skeletal, the same kind that everyone is talking about when they about talk about muscles. All Skeletal muscles are functional and will in fact like you said ""= strength"" (despite what most crossfitters love to say).   Looks like puffy bodybuilding muscle, not the dense strength training muscle.   These are both the same type of muscle...  what you mean here by ""puffy"" and ""dense"" has more to do with diet then preferred training styles. No, bodybuilding does not make you retain more fluids than a strength based program. I can't stress that enough, please don't go around saying that again."

EdmontonOilers,3a41c8,IGetComputersPuting,3,Wed Jun 17 15:19:36 2015 UTC,"Ahhh the old non functional sarcoplasmic training myth. Although, yes you can mostly target sarcoplasmic or myofibrillar in training, its really impossible to isolate one over the other (you cant have one solely over the other).  Most modern research on the subject leaves your way of thinking thoroughly debunked, notice how your sources have barely any scientific sources at the bottom of their articles?  http://www.kropblog.dk/en/sarcoplasmic-hypertrophy/  This sums up why powerlifters are usually stronger perfectly, and should pretty much end the debate right here. The tldr of it all is basically, motor skill adaptions (so neurological and it is probably the biggest factor), also more type 1 muscle fibres compared to type 2, and the fact that bodybuilders don't usually train the 3 big lifts in the same manner that powerlifters do. Not to mention it even goes over the whole ""fluid thing as well......  This article, talks about it as well, although has some errors, (like misquoting a study)  http://www.higher-faster-sports.com/nonfunctionalmyth.html  This also goes on about the myth of ""weak fluid muscles""  http://danogborn.com/are-bodybuilders-just-glycogen/"

EdmontonOilers,3a41c8,notsoyoungpadawan,-1,Wed Jun 17 07:03:01 2015 UTC,"Bodybuilders are different to powerlifters. I mean for someone who is so well versed with biology and fitness should understand this. Bodybuilders mainly utilize hypertrophy, i.e. higher reps with lower weight. Their large muscles are mainly filled with fluid rather than dese muscle fibres like powerlifters, who use lower reps and higher weight. Most powerlifters can deadlift over 3 times their bodyweight. Most bodybuilders don't deadlift. Note that I am not implying by any means that bodybuilders are weak. If you put a 6 foot 200lbs bodybuilder next to a 6 foot 200lbs powerlifter, the powerlifter will be much stronger than the bodybuilder. This is well documented and as someone with a (presumably) firm foothold in biology and fitness, you should know this."

EdmontonOilers,3a41c8,notsoyoungpadawan,-4,Wed Jun 17 04:38:28 2015 UTC,"Honestly, its quite easy to tell dense muscle from puffy muscle. A bodybuilder's arm will be more shaped with cuts because of isolation exercises like bicep curls, tricep extensions etc which work specificailly to increase a particular type of muscle's 'size'. On most powerlifters (or strength trainers) you can't distinguish the individual muscles on their arm unless they have a really low body fat %. From that picture you can tell Nurse's body fat % isn't under 10% and yet you can still see clearly defined triceps and biceps. Check out this guy's arm and compare it to Nurse's. That's what I mean by dense muscle.  And you know what, maybe I'm wrong about Nurse's training program, which is why this is just my opinion based on what I'm seeing. You don't have to agree with me."
