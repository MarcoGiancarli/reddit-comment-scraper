If instead you're honestly offended by cautionary PSAs intended to curb poor lifestyle choices, you might consider reevaluating why overeating is so important to you.

Fph,39dnxs,Sausagecock,4,Thu Jun 11 01:56:59 2015 UTC,"Hardly the true reason though. Automoderator was set up to delete anything that linked to another reddit and even deleted comments containing the name(but no link) of certain subreddits. People were banned for circumventing it and all submissions that didn't anonymize identifying info was quickly deleted.  Yet subreddits like SRS, SRD and their brethren are actually linking to the drama and actively brigading and somehow don't get banned,"

Mocking our Chairman or making fat post hit the front page is fun while the lulz last, but we need to think of something more long lasting. And effective. How about we go after the Reddit sponsors?

Write to them, call them out on social media. Make them know of the unhappiness and anger here. Make sure it becomes common knowledge that to advertise on this site is to get your name tainted in a newer ending series of memes and abuse.  If the admins thought that their draconian censorship would make this site more packageable to the corporate sponsors, let's make them think again.
