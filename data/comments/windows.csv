windows,3dz4f7,BobHogan,9,Tue Jul 21 06:30:36 2015 UTC,In the olden days font rendering was moved to the kernel for performance reasons. It stayed there until Windows 10 where I believe they started moving it to the user space. The Windows 10 patch might have something to do with the user mode component rather than what the other versions are dealing with.   Basically the Windows NT kernel is old and decisions were made through its development that didn't seem like a security risk at the time (or they didn't care). These choices can become issues in the future.
windows,3dz4f7,Stryker88,0,Tue Jul 21 07:10:23 2015 UTC,Really? They are still using Windows NT? I thought Win8 came with a new kernel. Either way thank you for explaining

In order to do the upgrade, you will need an activated windows 7/8 copy, as otherwise there is nothing to verify against.  It is also easy to transfer stuff. Either use windows easy transfer, which will let you export your settings too, or remember that all your old files will still be there, and you can just drag n drop to your new drive.  This seems harder than it is, but i'm going to put it in more depth ;)   Make a note of your license key. Make sure you have an installation CD (clean install is better than recovery; it's a few hours to reinstall programs, and settings, if exported can be moved over easily. You still have all your old files on the old hard drive, too, so no need to go a roundabout way to put them on the SSD. Better clean install now than have potential issues further down the line.) MAKE SURE YOU CAN ACCESS DRIVERS. Be it on your motherboard software CD or on your manufacturers website, in which case download at least the wifi/ethernet ones and put it ON A CD, as USB can be iffy and may not function. As a side note, if you have a mechanical keyboard, it may not work with your clean install before USB drivers are installed, so make sure you have a basic one to hand. Turn off computer. TURN OFF THE POWER SUPPLY AND UNPLUG SHIT. GROUND YOURSELF.  Open the case. Fully unplug the old drive (but don't remove it from the bay, obviously) Connect the new SSD, making sure it is connected to the Intel SATA 3 6.0GBps ports on your computer. Consult your manual to figure out which one this is. If you don't, the SSD won't run at full speed. Close up the case and replug shit in. Turn on the computer and jump straight into BIOS. Look for a setting that changes the sata mode from IDE to AHCI. Many SSD features, such as TRIM, are reliant on this. If you have a newer computer you may find that this is the default. Change the boot order to boot from CD first. Insert the CD Exit BIOS, then reboot. Install Windows. Install drivers, restarting whenever prompted. Take this time to enjoy the speed of your SSD. As a side note, if it's a samsung, I actually recommend installing the ""magician"" software, which has a lot of powerful tweaks easily accessible to save you time. Disable indexing on the drive.  Turn off, turn off the power supply, unplug shit, ground yourself, etc. Open up the case, reinstate the old HDD Boot up, using BIOS to make sure the SSD is being booted to first to save a bit of time. If the old drive doesn't appear in windows explorer, press start and search for ""partition,"" then open partition manager, right click on the old drive then activate/make a simple volume. It should then immediately appear in windows explorer and you should get a prompt as if you just inserted a USB stick.   Job done."
