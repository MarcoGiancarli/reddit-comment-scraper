LawSchool,3e39hd,MrFordization,35,Tue Jul 21 16:56:43 2015 UTC,"The thing about the bar exam is that most of us know how to do this. We did it successfully for three years. What really makes the exam hard (besides the amount of information) is the ramifications of failing. However, most people don't fail regardless of what state they take it in, even California. Parts of law school suck, parts are hard and the bar is the final hurdle. As I sit here reading professional responsibility (how many damn times do I really need to be tested on this stuff) I still don't regret my choice. Enjoy the next 3 years as much as you can, it isn't as bad as people would have you believe."
LawSchool,3e39hd,quasiinrem,28,Tue Jul 21 17:39:41 2015 UTC,"I regret going to law school, even before I started studying for the bar. I regret going +$100K in debt.

I regret everything over the last 3 years except marrying my husband and meeting and becoming friends with some of the smartest, coolest, most driven people I've ever met."

Country (and maybe state/province?), which university you get into, how you do out of your graduating class, and if you have good connections.

LawSchool,3e39hd,atonyatlaw,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:58:00 2015 UTC,"I also just want to throw out there that if you have debt like mine paying it back is incredibly hard anyways.  I had +$140K ($100K was low balling it) upon graduating (not including our medical debt now). My situation is a little unique in that I haven't really been able to make any significant repayments on my loans and medical deferment is much more limited than people realize. We received some financial help from our friends when they found out my husband had cancer too, which has helped us make a small payment on medical bills and the loans but we are still royal FUCKED because of the way the federal student loan system capitalizes the interest on graduate student loans.  Not being able to make the same type of payments we would have been able to had I been employed combined with my husband having to take time off, etc. has basically made a bad situation worse.   I really only recommend you go to a school where you are either offered a guaranteed full ride for all 3 years (so you don't come out with debt) or have your rich relatives pay because the reality is no matter whether you get cancer or not, it is a lot of debt to take on. I think I didn't fully understand the magnitude of what I was doing when I made the decision and I regret it but I did it so I am going to own up to my responsibilities, but I highly suggest anyone thinking about law school take a serious look at the financial situation you would be in upon graduation and what your true passion is. Even if you start law school with a passion for law, you may not always come out wanting to practice."

I hated those, and I still have nightmares about my 1L Property Exam (5 hours, closed book).  But finals period lasts maybe 3-4 weeks at most and then you're done, you're off to winter break or your summer internship. The bar exam is just...study. As /u/quasiinrem noted, there are potential major consequences to not passing the bar exam.  You have until 2018/2019 to worry about this, it's all good.  To be honest, I'm having one hell of a time watching the descent into madness on social media from friends (Facebook and whatnot) in my law school to friends in other law schools.

Decent, filling, healthy food.  For me, this meant peanuts, almonds, protein bars, meal replacement bars.  It kept me from crashing and subsequently binging.  I found that when I was extremely busy with finishing the reading, getting to class, participating in class, I'd forget to be hungry until I was starving.  You need to make sure you're eating at somewhat regular times.  So at dinnertime?   You need to get some calories in your body.  And this goes for all meals."

You can put it on ANYTHING; rice, pasta, salad, wraps, sandwiches. And it's lean. Buy the bulk bags of chicken breast, or buy it fresh. Whatever works best for your budget/storage situation. Fresh will be cheaper in bulk than frozen. Go to the store on days they sell the ""dated"" chicken! Freeze it immediately. It will be fine.  I also bought protein bars in bulk and ate one for breakfast each day. Quick. Easy. No cooking or mess. Structured amount of calories.  As far as working out goes, you just gotta try and make some time as best you can. I always told myself a 20 minute workout was better than a 0 minute workout.

Get ready and be at work/law school 8:30-9. You'll feel more alert throughout day. Only downside is you get tired fast at night, so part time might be harder."

Food wise, I've cut out drive-thru fast food entirely and only try to order out once a week (better than the three times a week I used to). I don't have the best metabolism in the world, but my first two years of law school I was so lazy. I changed that up once I felt like I became a blob.   I gained about 15lbs (doing the part time program and working for a firm). I lost that weight (still being a big guy), but have gotten way more active. I play tennis for a hr a day when I can, and I make sure I go for walks as well. A fit bit may be a great alternative since it makes you conscientious of walking/steps etc...  For food wise, they're not the best alternative, but doing the smart choice meals help you with portion control (or any of those lean cuisines etc). Also, meal prepping, which I'm terrible at, will help you portion control since your dinner may be smaller, but you have a healthier meal for the next day (then say going to buy something from subway).   Just a few things I've picked up because I've felt very similar. There's great advice from everyone here (the internet/tv one's are the worst habits for me when I want to decompress after a day of work). Good luck!"

LawSchool,3e2j53,spirit_spine,2,Tue Jul 21 14:15:14 2015 UTC,"I ride a bike. It's good exercise. It's great thinking time.  I like getting exercise in this way because I don't need to make time to go to a hot room filled with sweaty people I feel like I need to compete with. Riding a bike is just part of my day. I want to be stronger so that I can ride farther and see more with less effort. It is a means to more than one end.   At first riding can seem too difficult, but if you can stay at it for a couple of weeks the hills are much less daunting and the seat stops hurting your butt. As an added bonus, since I started regularly riding a bike I have a much more detailed geographic knowledge of my area - which means while the other guy is pulling up google maps I'm already thinking about the intersection.  There are downsides. Bicycles are not weatherproof and there is some danger riding them. I was in a rather serious bicycle accident almost 2 years ago and had six months in a sling due to the negligence of a moped rider. After the accident I went from around 220 lbs to 250 lbs. It took me awhile to get back on my bike even after I healed partly because it was expensive to repair my bicycle and party because of how depressed I was about what a fpos I had become. When I finally started riding again, it took me about 2-3 weeks to drop 30 lbs.  Many people will prescribe running but I have heard far too many old men's regrets about high impact exercise to take on that risk. Plus you see so much more, and meet so many more interesting people on a bicycle. I see an athletic guy in my community who could possibly kick my ass all around town on a bicycle. He's almost 90 years old and he always has a big smile on his huge face."

Someone told me you have the freshman 15 and the law school 25.  That same person told me that most people who gain that weight lose it by the end of their third year.    What I took out of that was to not worry about your weight.  The first year is stressful and busy for everyone and gaining weight is a by product of that.  All that said you know what to do to lose weight and as you find yourself with more free time, do those things.  Anyways good luck."
LawSchool,3e2j53,MetalFace127,2,Tue Jul 21 17:37:32 2015 UTC,My advice: don't expect immediate results.  Personal fitness is a journey - you will need to experiment and see what works for you. You didn't get fat overnight and you wont get skinny over night either.

No. Seriously. 12 donuts. I ate them all. It was fucking delicious.  I wholly recommend controlling your food intake and start counting calories. MyFitnessPal is amazing at that. Furthermore, get out there and start exercising. A good ""no excuse"" program is C25K, you can find how to use it via Google or check out /r/C25K. Basically, it helps you gain stamina to run 5k (3.11 miles) without stopping over the course of a couple months. You don't need to invest in any special athletic gear, just wear a tshirt and shorts.  There are good FAQs on /r/fitness and /r/running that can help you out as well.  Granted, I was full time (and lived with my parents) so it was much easier making my transition since they'd have dinner ready for me when I'd come home from the gym during 1L summer.  But it's doable. Portion control + 30 minutes of running/jogging should get you down from 235 real quick.  You need to do this as well, because the healthier you get, you will feel better, more alert, and ready to take on 2L like a bat out of hell."

Just start a jogging or a lifting routine and stick to it. Don't try to lose all of it on the first run/workout. Also cut out stress eating if that's a problem. In my first year I would always eat too much fast food during exams because I'd convince myself I didn't have enough time to prepare something healthier. Or I'd tell myself it was okay because I was stressed. Just stopping that helped me lose a few pounds. Also if your law school is big on intramurals try joining a team. Having fun almost makes you forget you're working out.  If you start and stay consistent you'll be surprised how much you enjoy taking some time away to run or workout.

I once entered into a bar and approached someone and offered them $500 dollars to ""take out"" a high school teacher that accused me of cheating on a spelling test.  The man at the bar agreed to this arrangement.  When he went to the home of the teacher at night,  he entered through an open window and went through the house until he reached the bedroom.   The man shot 5 times and each bullet hit the target.  Unbeknownst to the hit man,  the figure in the bed was the teacher's wife and her neighbor whom she was having an affair with.   The hitman ran out of the house.  2 hours later,  the teacher gets home after drinking with his friends because he planned to kill his wife and neighbor because he anticipated they would be banging at home.  The man walked into the bedroom and shot the figures in the bed.  The police arrived shortly after due to being called by another neighbor after hearing the first shots by the hitman.   In a jurisdiction that follows the common law definition of murder,  what is the most severe crime the teacher can be charged with?     A- Murder.  B-Attempted Murder. C-Burglary.  D- Go fuck yourself."

LawSchool,3e04ru,jawathehutt,20,Mon Jul 20 23:44:38 2015 UTC,"It is likely that the most severe crime the teacher will be charged with is attempted murder. The issue here is whether, under the common law, the teacher satisfied the level of culpability required for the commission of attempted murder. In order for the charge to succeed, the teacher must engage in purposeful and knowing conduct which would constitute murder if the attendant circumstances were as he believed them to be. Despite the fact that both his wife and neighbor were already deceased, the teacher acted with malice aforethought. The teacher shot at both bodies, with purpose, under the impression they were both alive. While the defense may argue heat of passion, it is likely to not succeed because a reasonable person under the teachers circumstances would have cooled off and the provocation was no longer in effect to exculpate the teacher.  Moreover, the teacher, prior to finding his wife in bed with his neighbor, intended to kill them both. Therefore, it is likely the most severe crime the teacher will be charged with is B, attempted murder.   Edit: a word."
LawSchool,3e04ru,KING_UDYR,20,Tue Jul 21 02:08:21 2015 UTC,"Purposeful and knowing are mens reas listed within the MPC, not the common law.  Rather, the issue in dispute is whether legal impossibility or factual impossibility are a defense to excuse the teacher's attempted murder.    Attempted murder is a specific intent crime, i.e., the defendant needs to have the specific intent to commit a murder, which he was unable to complete for whatever reason.  Generally, a defendant will be liable for an attempt so long as (1) he has the specific intent to commit the crime, and (2) the defendant takes an overt act towards the commission of that crime.  Overt act is simply defined as something beyond mere preparation.  Legal impossibility IS a defense to attempt, and is available to the defendant where the defendant has committed no crime, even if he attempted all the acts he had intended.  Factual Impossibility, however, is not a defense, and it exists where the crime is impossible due to some physical or factual condition, unknown to the defendant.    Here, the teacher's shooting of the dead body is more appropriately deemed ""factual impossibility.""  The teacher intended to shoot two people, not to shoot two dead bodies.  By contrast, legal impossibility would exist where the defendant intended to shoot two dead bodies, which wasn't actually a crime.  Thus, legal impossibility is not available to the defendant.  Moreover, factual impossibility is also unavailable to aid the defendant. Here, the teachers actions would be deemed a factual impossibility, because completion of the substantive crime (murder) was impossible due to some factual condition (their already being dead) that was unknown to the defendant.  However, because such impossibility does not eliminate the defendant's mens rea, he can still be said to have satisfied the elements of attempted murder.  Specifically, the defendant (1) intended to commit a murder; and (2) the defendant took a overt act towards the commitment of that murder, by shooting them.  This act was clearly beyond simple preparation for the murder.  Just because the defendant was not ultimately able to commit the substantive crime, he can still be liable for attempted murder.    Thus, the defendant is liable for Attempted Murder.   I'm so sorry, I can't stop myself. This was helpful practice, don't feel the need to respond."

LawSchool,3e04ru,CycleChi,7,Tue Jul 21 14:38:53 2015 UTC,"Voluntary intoxication is only a defense where the defendant is so intoxicated, he lacks the ability to form a specific intent. Here, this defense would be unavailable because the facts do not suggest the defendant is so inebriated he would be unable to form the intent to murder the two deceased.  The facts state he ""he planned to kill his wife and neighbor,"" which suggests he still maintained the specific intent to commit the murder.  Thus, voluntary intoxication is not a defense.  You're so right, I should have discussed it. This si why I'm going to fail."
LawSchool,3e04ru,Enderdejorand,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:13:35 2015 UTC,"I'd suggest another angle to consider... The mens rea and actus need to coincide at the same point.  Thus, for an attempt charge to stick - we need to ask, when had the defendant moved beyond simple contemation and actually begun to put his plan into action (ie actions beyond mere preparation or contemplation).    It is at that point that the defendant was committing the offence.  Now, I would argue that point is well before the shooting.  It may have been before he stepped into the bar for some ""Dutch courage"".  It may have been when he loaded the gun, it may have been earlier when he discovered his wife and her lover where going to meet that night for a tryst.  The point is, when the intent to murder was formed is relevant as it may indeed lead to a claim of legal impossibility.  If (say), he came home and saw the neighbours car in the drive way, he decided that enough was enough and he enters the home and loads his gun (thus moving beyond mere contemplation)... But the victims were already long dead.  Thus, a legal impossibility to intend to kill someone that is already deceased.  I'd suggest that he can only make this claim of he can prove (on a balance of probabilities) that he formed the necessary intent after they were already deceased."
LawSchool,3e04ru,cdnbroker,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:56:42 2015 UTC,"But the victims were already long dead. Thus, a legal impossibility to intend to kill someone that is already deceased.   But that's not what a Legal Impossibility is.  Legal impossibility exists where you accomplish what you intended to do, but it simply isn't a crime under the law.  Here, he intended to murder people.  He didn't intend to shoot dead bodies.  You can certainly intend to kill someone, even where they are dead, if you are unaware they are dead.  Thus, he didn't accomplish what he intended to do, and legal impossibility isn't available.  Also, as to the ""Dutch courage,"" if you go to a bar to work up the courage to commit a crime, you still have the specific intent to commit that crime.  You'd argue it on an essay, but that's at least the MBE answer."
LawSchool,3e04ru,Enderdejorand,5,Wed Jul 22 00:05:05 2015 UTC,"I dunno... The impossibility angle is high here... Can you be charged with attempted murder if you have the appropriate Mens Rea to kill Julius Ceasar?  Even though he died millennia ago?    Ok, a bit reducio ad absurdum, but the point is, the impossibility of the actus is relevant.  I know of a few unusual cases where people were acquitted of attempted smuggling because what they thought was contra banned was actually legally allowable, and thus, while they had the intent to smuggle, they didn't actually smuggle anything, and thus they cannot be guilty."
LawSchool,3e04ru,cdnbroker,11,Tue Jul 21 03:01:57 2015 UTC,"contra banned    FYI, on the off chance that wasn't an autocorrect fail, it's actually ""contraband.""  Also, you're conflating legal impossibility, a valid defense, with factual impossibility, which generally is not. The Wikipedia article actually gives a fairly good account of the difference.   Essentially, your intended act is what matters. If what you're trying to do is a crime, then you're committing a criminal attempt, even if it's impossible for you to succeed. But if your intended act is lawful, then you aren't breaking the law, even if you think you are.   Obviously the line between the two can get a little fuzzy in some situations, but that's the basic idea."
LawSchool,3e04ru,jpb225,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:23:51 2015 UTC,"I agree - but the other factor (at least in my jurisdiction) is that the mens and the actus need to be coincident.  So, the question becomes at what point was the attempt made?  And, at that point, was it legally impossible for the actus and mens to coincide?  E.g. If he could prove that he formed the intent at a point in which the victims were already deceased, then surely it cannot be a crime to wish to kill someone who is already dead..."

It's okay to get a 50 (I got a 57, so not much higher than you). I'd say just spend this past week relaxing instead of trying to cram. This is a test where showing up with sharp logical reasoning and reading comp. skills will be more important than having crammed the week before. So just relax this week, get in a comfortable groove and work through what you can, but don't stress. It'll be better to show up well-rested than having done an extra 200 problems but being burnt out."

LawSchool,3e03f9,infamousthey,6,Tue Jul 21 00:14:55 2015 UTC,Best time to miss a question or 50 is on the practice exams. If you've spent the time to figure out you got it down to 50/50 then you've done all you can. Next time you won't be as hesitant on picking an answer you liked more than your back-up.   I'd keep up the essays and MBEs. You don't want to try anything new on the bar--including recognizing your bad habit.

Don't get down.  Keep doing MBE practice (pays off more than essay practice, as far as I can tell), and keep your head up.  And take /u/suchacleverguy's advice and relax a bit too."

The multi-subject question sets seem to only have one or to very difficult questions per subject, with a smattering of easy ones and moderately difficult ones."
LawSchool,3e03f9,spirit_spine,4,Tue Jul 21 13:48:10 2015 UTC,"Hey, I scored the exact same as you! Same background scores too. I've decided to focus on my strongest subjects and only lightly review my weakest ones for the MBE. It seems unreasonable at this point that I'm suddenly going to become a Real Property/Torts genius. Along with my strong MBE subjects, I'm also getting around to studying for the essays, but only those subjects most likely to appear on the exam.  At this point in the game you're not going to make any huge leaps or improvements in a weak area. Do your best to maintain what you're good at, get a little better at some things, and then just wait it out until about a week from now when everything will be out of your hands."
LawSchool,3e03f9,DietCokeMachine,5,Tue Jul 21 00:01:47 2015 UTC,I'm sorry but I respectfully disagree. People tend to focus on their strongest subjects because it makes them feel better when they take practice quizzes in these areas and see higher scores. It makes them feel warm and fuzzy inside. But this is a false sense of comfort and I think this practice is detrimental. You really should focus on your weakest subjects (in order of their likelihood on the exam) so you can make the greatest gains in the time you have left. Lets say someone is scoring 85-90% in ConLaw right now. If that person continues to focus on ConLaw and pushes their score to +95% (basically mastery level) how much is their MBE score going to change between if they took the bar exam today and later this month? Probably not much. Maybe they would get an additional 1 or 2 questions right on the exam but probably not much more. I think if that same person focused on their weakest areas (especially if those areas are one of the more commonly tested subcategories) then they can make a much larger improvement in their score with the limited time they have left.

LawSchool,3e03f9,yeradolt,3,Tue Jul 21 04:27:03 2015 UTC,"My uneducated recommendation is this: have you been doing pretty well on MBE so far? If so, focus more on essays (I'm still blowing it hard on essays) and don't let the refresher today fuck with you too much.   It was designed in part to give you wonky questions, the answers to which were harder and rarer than usual. The goal (I think) of combining something hard, that you will very likely get wrong, with it also being unique, is that it's the perfect time for that random fucking rule to stick in your mental craw.   Their hope (I think), which is founded on more research than any of us here (I think), is that you will pick up a few extra points next week because you'll have those left-field rules / exemptions / subrules / yaddda stuck.   So instead of spending 3 minutes on a long ass question next week with a really hard answer, you might just make the quick association to the same correct answer from today, and move on."

Got in the 55th percentile on the full day MBE, but I got 70% on the half day and 70% on the 50q given to me today.  I improved my score by focusing on my weak subjects that occur frequently on the MBE, like property and contracts.  Figure out the subjects that you are lowest in and practice those.  I think the key here is to not panic.  If you got 76% correct, you are already within passing.  The only thing that is going to fuck you are your nerves and confidence.  You know enough to pass, just keep trucking and make notes on what you missed.  Additionally, Barbri has been throwing some really tough questions in the practice questions, like venue rules for interpleader.  How the fuck am I supposed to know that shit?"

The University even secured funding from SUNY and was taking steps to get the necessary accreditation, etc. Many were disappointed when the plans were shelved, but it's better for the market in the long run.

LawSchool,3dzqwx,newprofile15,3,Tue Jul 21 01:35:16 2015 UTC,I think you are right when you say the Binghamton law school plan was all about prestige.

In addition to the law school plan was the move to Division I athletics and we know how that turned out with the resulting scandal involving the basketball team.

As you say New York State has plenty of law schools some of which a very prestigious and I don't see how Binghamton would every compete with those schools.

The students starting Fall '15 shouldn't be compared to Fall '14, since who they're actually replacing is Fall '12. You can have increased 1L enrollment and still have a decrease in total enrollment. It takes year of rebound to bounce off the bottom.  Here's a quickie example to illustrate the idea, class sizes being 3L-2L-1L, respectively:  2014-15 school year: 200-150-120, total of 470 students.  2015-16 school year: 150-120-130, total of 400 students.  Bigger 1L class, but smaller overall enrollment. Ain't hit bottom yet.  2016-17 school year: 120-130-140, total of 390 students. This is probably the bottom."
LawSchool,3dzqwx,RippyMcBong,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:53:43 2015 UTC,"It's probably evening out to ~35K students competing for ~25K jobs.  Nothing from the statistics indicates that law was ever as job secure as medicine, despite the perception.  Third and Fourth tier schools have probably always struggled to place their students in legal jobs, whereas all but HYS have had students who end up unintentionally unemployed."
LawSchool,3e0167,HolySheed,4,Mon Jul 20 22:25:28 2015 UTC,"For firms that are not on your school's OCI list, the first thing to do is check and see that they have a summer program.  Most larger firms will have a ""careers"" section on their website where they indicate whether they have a summer program and, if they do, provide contact information for a recruiter or hiring partner.  If they have a summer program and give you contact information, unless told otherwise, use email rather than post. If it's a smaller firm that doesn't have any information about a summer program and doesn't explicitly state that they hire experienced laterals only (or something to that effect), reaching out won't hurt. Send an email indicating that you're interested to see if they are looking to hire summer associates, let them know why you're interested in their firm, and attach your resume and transcript.   OCI is not the only way to get interviews. I interviewed with a number of firms that I contacted directly -- some of these firms were coming to OCI but allowed me to interview during the summer (Quinn does this a lot, but I had such interviews with a few other big firms). Additionally, if your school's OCI system is lottery-based and you don't get an interview with a firm you wanted, feel free to contact the firm's recruiter directly and explain the situation -- they may or may not ask why you didn't bid their firm higher if you were so interested, so have an answer ready for that. FWIW, I summered at and will be returning to a firm that I reached out to after not getting an interview through the lottery selection process."

One risk is hiring people without the three-month interview, where it's harder to hide things than in a 20-minute screener or one-day callback. But now Quinn will get to see far more grades before they commit -- I imagine this would change the 2L/3L atmosphere at many schools."

At my school they had a list of firms who weren't doing OCI that had summer programs along with who to send your resume to/contact in general.  Otherwise, you can obviously look at the firm's websites, but that was a really convenient way that I went about applying to firms that didn't interview at my school--and I ended up as an SA at one too, so it was definitely worth it for me!"
LawSchool,3e0167,loveconduit,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:49:12 2015 UTC,"Different firms prefer different means for applying to be a SA. The important thing is that you contact the firm to express interest and to find out the application process so that you do it properly. It is usually stated on the website, and is easy to find with a little research that you should be doing on every firm to which you apply anyway.   In my personal experience, the more steps you can take to actively pursue a SA from non-OCI firms, the more successful you will be. For my 2L summer, I landed a SA position at a firm that wasn't on my school's OCI list. I am from the southwest and went to law school in the midwest. I always planned to go back to my home state to work, but there was only 1 firm from my home state that did OCI. I created my own interview week to remedy the OCI situation. I researched all the firms in the area I wanted to be and booked a trip back to my home state in August (before normal OCIs). When I applied to all the firms in which I was interested, I informed them in my cover letter that I would already be in town on X dates. This helped tremendously, as many were very willing to meet with me without having to fly me out to do so. I was able to book Monday through Friday of my week trip with interviews. Some of the interviews were 30 minute initial interviews, but some firms took advantage of me being in town and were willing to jump straight to callback-style interviews. I still did OCIs at my school after my trip, but my SA position came from one of the firms from the interview week I created myself. All of this said, I understand that this approach would work best if you know you want to go to a specific area, but it was a very successful way to find a position.  Edit: just to clarify, the firm from which I received the SA position is not the same 1 firm that did OCIs at my school."

And for law school, ""shitty"" is more than half the schools that are available. Get a good LSAT score - your veteran status will help get you into a decent school, and the GI bill will make school more affordable (which gives you flexibility in choosing a decent career path without a huge debt burden). From there, your veteran status will help you get a look at more jobs than your peers. That's the path I'd recommend (and it's the one I took).   But first things first: get your bachelor's if you haven't already, and kill the LSAT."

LawSchool,3e2ee3,honskampf,4,Tue Jul 21 15:29:23 2015 UTC,"Are you trying to say that you don't think it's worth your time to try to major in something rigorous for undergrad? Or are you under the impression that you can go to law school without graduating from college first? You are 7 years of schooling away from completing law school, and the GI bill will only cover 4, maybe 5 if you play the loopholes just right. Throw in the fact that you mention elsewhere that you live in the only state that doesn't have a law school.  My recommendation is for you to get a bachelor's degree with your GI Bill. Then worry about law school if you get to the point where it makes sense. But right now, you're asking about running technique when you haven't even learned how to walk yet, to borrow from the common ""crawl, walk, run"" analogy that's popular in military training. So learn to walk. Running can come later."

LawSchool,3e2ee3,intend,2,Tue Jul 21 13:36:17 2015 UTC,"As annoying as it is, the actual price of a school is heavily dependent on your LSAT scores, and GPA to a lesser extent. While some top ranked schools can cost ~40-50k a year in tuition, a lot of students get scholarships so probably only pay 15-25k, with some getting full rides as well. Before you think about budget reasons or anything just take the LSAT, and do as best you can. If you can get 165+, you can get a very good scholarship to any regional school, well within any military budget."
LawSchool,3e2ee3,UntimelyOccurrence,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:50:58 2015 UTC,Didn't realize the LSAT had that much influence on college costs.  I've heard about how the SATs could get you decent scholarships but you had to usually get insanely high to knock out 50% of the costs.  Also my GPA from my high school years is very mediocre and from over a decade ago so I'm not sure how all that's going to play out.
LawSchool,3e2ee3,yeradolt,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:27:47 2015 UTC,"Your GPA won't matter much considering the length of time you've been out and your military service (heard from a top law school admissions officer that GPA matters less when you've been out for awhile. It matters more to recent college grads. The LSAT (totally different than the SATs) still matters, despite it having really no relevance to law school itself, but schools use it frequently to decide admission/scholarship info.  Also you specified highschool GPA, do you have an undergraduate college degree? If not have to do that first. Don't even consider law school things until you have a undergraduate degree. Law School + Undergrad is minimum ~7 years of school and lots lots of money. A lot can change during that time, whether personally or professionally.  I just saw you posted down lower about fears of transfer credits, etc. Don't be worried about that. Some of the best schools in the country don't have law schools, and the reputation of a college can often be radically different than the reputation of its law school. If you're going to undergrad in Alaska, just make sure it is an accredited university. BUT DO NOT GO TO LAW SCHOOL THERE. There is not an accredited law school in all of Alaska, and you should never ever go to an unaccredited law school (may not even be able to take the bar to become a lawyer from an unaccredited school).

They recently started a Veterans Clinic where law students help veterans connect to benefits and resources.  Good hands-on experience, and some ex-Army guys in my class really enjoyed it.

If the school doesn't give exact ranks then nobody knows exactly where something in the middle falls. Based on the curve, a grade .2 above the top 25% cutoff might be top 10% or it might be top 20%. People's grades tend to clump up when schools enforce certain numbers of As, Bs, and Cs. Employers are likely to give you the benefit of the doubt.

I never got called for those positions, but my plan was to explain the situation and lack of info if asked for my transcript.  And seriously, what a stupid practice. Why not at LEAST include top half as a band?  Like its not relevant?"
LawSchool,3dyhvi,rita-poon,3,Mon Jul 20 17:25:31 2015 UTC,"In a T25 and even a lower T14, having a top 50% designation has the capacity to screw over people that are below that.  It's probably much better to keep the firms guessing what the top 50% is than to have it written.  It won't help people that are vastly below the average, but if your school's 1L curve is a 3.2, employers will probably assume 3.1 is median, even if it probably isn't, which gives the middle third of the class a shot."

I'm guessing they do this precisely because it is so relevant to a lot of employers. The school knows that a lot of attorneys will ask if you're in the top half, and it would rather have you answer, ""I don't know, my school doesn't rank the top half"" instead of a definitive ""no."" They're trying to cover the bottom 2/3 of the class by obfuscating rankings rather than help out the people  between the 50th and 65th percentiles.  And because our grades are so damn inflated and the cutoffs aren't published, this allows us bottom 2/3ers to say ""sorry i don't know my rank but look at this high GPA -- it would definitely place me in the top half if they published that sort of thing."" It's pretty fucking frustrating not knowing this information, but for all I know I wouldn't make the cut anyway and am better off like the majority who delude ourselves into thinking we rank higher than we do."

Leaving one's rank off of a resume makes this process more difficult.  Apply your forego listing it because it's bragging philosophy to admissions.  Wouldn't it be harmful to the admissions (and sorting) process if everyone left their UGPA and LSAT off of their applications?  Why would it be harmful?  For those same reasons, it's harmful to the employment ""admissions"" process to leave it off."

If you have a paragraph somewhere about your background or what led you to law school or whatever it's easy enough to say that the disability played a role in your drive or w/e it is you want to say.   I had a callback and offer from a biglaw firm based on the fact that I obliquely referenced the fact that my sister has a mental disability as one of the reasons that I initially pursued medical school instead of law school (my resume has a lot of biomedical engineering stuff on it then I seemingly ""randomly"" turned to law school). The hiring partner had a nephew with the same disability, so we talked about it during our interviews."
LawSchool,3dydef,TreacherousBeagle,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:30:13 2015 UTC,"So I've been following the standard format where I introduce myself/say why I'm interested in the firm in the first paragraph, talk about my strengths and some experience from my past jobs and how I could utilize those working for x firm in the second and third paragraphs, and sort of signing off in the last paragraph. This summer in working at a disability law nonprofit, so I could sort of shoehorn it in there?"
LawSchool,3dydef,ec2xs,2,Mon Jul 20 19:32:01 2015 UTC,"You could do that. I didn't know that was a standard format. As I recall my cover letters were always like  ""I'm a student at X. I got into law this way. I want to work for you because you do this and that and are in this city, and because I have these abilities. Sincerely, me.""   So it was easy to stick into the ""why I got into law"" part.   You could say something like ""working at disability law nonprofit X has been a meaningful experience because it has afforded me the opportunity to help those with disabilities; I experienced the difficulty of growing up with Y disability and I understand, to some extent, what they are going through."" Obviously that's not very polished but you get the picture."
LawSchool,3dydef,ec2xs,4,Mon Jul 20 20:16:09 2015 UTC,"I'm surprised at the advice you have received here.  You should absolutely disclose it, and while firms don't have ""quotas"" it does make you a diversity candidate.  As someone with a disability myself, you've overcome something significant and you can incorporate it subtly into your cover letter."
LawSchool,3dydef,ec2xs,2,Mon Jul 20 16:51:27 2015 UTC,"And I don't want to seem like a whiner or anything. My disability is not readily apparent (I'm deaf but use hearing aids) so I know I don't have it ""as bad as I could"" but I know firms do have an emphasis on diversity, and honestly law school has been harder because of my disability. So."
LawSchool,3dydef,onionmancer,2,Mon Jul 20 19:33:59 2015 UTC,"Understood (mine is not readily apparent and does not effect 99% of my work life).  In my opinion, it's not a merit system based on how difficult a given disability is, it's just an aspect of your self that may be pertinent to their consideration of you.  And it certainly won't do any harm.  Besides, as much as it would be great to have a perfectly meritorious system, everyone you're up against is using everything in their arsenal to get jobs - nepotism, wealth, privilege, playing tennis with a partner's niece, going to the same undergrad as a founding partner, being from the area, being affluent, liking sports, sexual orientation, being a parent, whatever.  Nobody else is stopping to say, ""you know what, I shouldn't use this to help my career or give myself as much opportunity as possible.""    There are subtle ways to work it in without looking like you're pandering for diversity points.  I was reluctant to even ""check the box"" for a long time, but your experience and what you've had to deal with is a testament to a lot of positive attributes.  It may be hard for you to see it for yourself, but for the layman it's something to be considered, and since an employer will learn of it eventually may as well be up front with it."
LawSchool,3dydef,onionmancer,2,Mon Jul 20 20:07:20 2015 UTC,"Thank you so much for your advice. And you're totally right, eventually someday they're going to figure out I'm deaf and it's better to be up front about it and spin it as positive than try to act like it doesn't exist."

(2) is it a visible disabiltiy? assuming that you have an OCI bid system, then your screening interview will show it before someone has to amke a decision ab out you."
LawSchool,3dydef,ec2xs,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:16:06 2015 UTC,"To answer your questions, there aren't any job fairs near me that I know of, and my disability is not readily apparent.

LawSchool,3dydef,onionmancer,2,Mon Jul 20 19:36:08 2015 UTC,"Yeah, then you'll be an attractive candidate because you'll count for everyone's diversity statistics but your disability doesn't significantly impair your ability to perform at the job.    I don't know how public agency hiring works in most places but you may get a huge bump in hiring there too.  Especially with a state job, you may get a sweet pension/vacation schedule out of that even if you make less money."

LawSchool,3dx2d1,LSthrowaway2014,4,Mon Jul 20 18:13:18 2015 UTC,"A lot of white collar litigation requires extensive review and audits of financial records for things like billing rates, Compliance with sec or other regulatory agency regulations, compliance with cost accounting standards or claim determination in federal contracts, or trade regs/statutes (tarrifs, itar. Etc).  So beyond tax, you could find a niche in fields like m&a, federal contracts/general construction, international trade, securities regulation, or just general litigation consultants.   PWC, deloit and baker tilly are 3 big acounting firms with offices in DC that would probably be fairly interested in CPA/JDS for this type of consulting. Outside major cities though, you'd be much less valuable, compared to what you could potentially make in a major white collar market like DC, NYC, chicago, or LA."

They had two associates and one left a little over a year ago, they said they have discussed hiring a second associate but haven't made a decision. She said if the fit was right and they needed someone, their certainly could be an offer. At some point one partner said that there it is a reasonable possibility that a year from now, the would be considering bringing on another associate.   The firm was just in the news for some high profile clients they just brought in so as of now, it seems like there is work. It is also encouraging that they had two associates but one left, so their is an office open!!"

Even if you find that this is a waste of time early on, that's because you're at a point where you've learned how to read the material well to pick out holdings/etc.    E&Es probably don't need to be purchased until a month in, and are, as the name suggests, a supplement, not what you should be learning off of.  It's very hit and miss to assume that the E&E will ever be able to replace learning from recitation and going to professor office hours.    Old outlines are probably also about a month in for good measure.  Get them from upper classmen acquaintances, or your school might have an outline bank as well.  They should point you in the right direction, but I wouldn't just read off of them entirely.  Again, not every class is the same; some of them you can just modify the model outline whereas more confusing courses require you to more thoroughly digest the material."
LawSchool,3dw8mp,Isentrope,0,Mon Jul 20 01:58:25 2015 UTC,"It's more about mastering the testing process, which will be intensified on the bar. About half-way through 1st semester, when classes become redundant and exams are on the horizon, look into test prep books like Seigel's for nailing down concepts and getting familiar with test questions. The best resource, however, is getting your hands on past exams. Memorize rule statements and master the IRAC process."

This sale could happen before the semester starts or after the semester starts.  The EEs will be around $12.  Buy supplements for the year on that day.  As to which supplements to buy, get the QA, EE, and Glannons.  Don't read the entire books.  Just run through practice problems on your phone or ereader any chance you get.  Reading the casebook is kind of meh for acing exams.  I wouldn't not read it 1L year but don't spend forever trying to look great on call (unless your class actually has a participation component for your grade).  Instead, figure out the 1-2 sentence holding and the reasoning for that holding and then do as many practice problems as you can.  Lastly, always critique your supplements.  Some will disagree with your professor.  Really, though, you should be critical of anything you read anyway.  You're training to be a lawyer."

The only thing being a lawyer is good for is practicing law. There is a cheaper and better route to any other endeavor than law school if your goal isn't practicing law.  As far as politics go, the best way to get into it is connections. The only way to make connections is to do campaign work. Start volunteering with local politicians or even on national campaigns. You'll begin doing lowly grunt work, and you'll mostly work for free the majority of the times, but they do reward the best campaign workers with government appointments later on. Another route would be to work for a member of congress in various summer positions open to high school and college kids. That's another great avenue to get your foot in the door. If you dont' want to work in a politicans office, you could also work for an NGO or other non profits and do public policy analyst type work.   Basically politics is all about who you know, not your degree or what you know, for the most part. You should start rubbing shoulders with important people. Good luck.   One thing to look into is the George Washington university semester in Washington program when you're in college. Their applied politics courses are awesome and you'll get to know some really good players within Washington.

LawSchool,3dvdqu,newprofile15,2,Sun Jul 19 21:20:00 2015 UTC,"It's probably correct to say that GPA is more important than school rank/prestige. However, with HYS admissions, quality of the undergrad institution might factor in more than people suspect, especially at the margins. I went to a ""miscellaneous state university"" and definitely feel like an exception. Looking at our class year book, there is such a concentration of high ranked schools listed (e.g., MIT, Princeton, Berkeley, Yale, etc.,), that I suspect that, along with selection bias and smarter students with higher LSATs at elite schools, the quality of the schools factors into admissions.  As far as I know, there hasn't been a study that analyzed admissions data to calculate what, if any, weight the qualify of the undergrad institutions are given during HYS admissions, but I'd be surprised if admissions were truly ""prestige blind."""
LawSchool,3dvdqu,incaseyoucare,2,Mon Jul 20 01:00:16 2015 UTC,"Does the university you receive a degree in prior to law school matter in the law school application process?   People like to say no because it's not hugely important but the answer is yes.   Law Schools mostly care about the raw numbers. If you have a 4.0 and achieve a 180 on the LSAT, you're probably going to get into whatever school you apply to -- even if you went to a mediocre school and had an easy major. But do you think a student who had a 3.8 GPA while majoring in communications at the local community college is going to have the same sway in the professional school applications process as a student who had a 3.8 GPA while double-majoring in nuclear physics and electrical engineering at MIT?  Law schools care a ton about their reputation which is mostly determined by ranking which is in turn heavily dependent on the index of the incoming student body (undergrad GPA + LSAT). But law schools have dumped a lot of money and effort into research that helps them find the cream of the crop. They have numbers that tell them everything they need to know about people who graduate from your school with your major.    Could I attend a miscellaneous state university, get an amazing GPA, and score well on LSAT and still theoretically attend a top law school such as Yale or Harvard?   Absolutely. A 3.75 GPA and a 170 LSAT will get you into a great school with a substantial scholarship regardless of where you went to undergrad. To get into HYS you'll likely need higher scores than that, regardless of where you went to undergrad."

It may be that prestigious undergrads attract the smarter/overachieving types => create competitive environment => work harder/better grades/maybe grade inflation => admitted into better schools. Or it could just be that HYS do care about undergrad somewhat. Speaking with current 1Ls and 2Ls at H and S, everyone (9 people) was from a prestigious undergrad or a regional best. Of course, this could also be biased in that people from competitive, extracurricular-heavy ""prestigious"" undergrads are accustomed to reaching out (sort of an extracurricular).

Journals and moot court will be pretty difficult if not impossible to do and still maintain your sanity. Study smart, find out what works and what doesn't and don't waste your limited time on non effective study strategies. Finally, keep up your health, try to get enough sleep, exercise, and eat right, this will go a long way in making sure you have enough energy."

There should be plenty of opportunities for you to do your 1L summer in Korea though (not an SA at a biglaw firm), so you can certainly give that a shot before deciding whether it's a good fit for your 2L SA/eventual job.

Paul Hastings comes to mind, though I think theirs might be teamed up with Kim & Chang or something, and I know there are others out there. Research them. At OCI, these firms set up interviews separately for those interested in foreign offices, for which you apply at that time. I have a friend who was always set on a foreign country, did a 2L SA in an office in that country, and got an offer for that office at the end of the summer. I also have a few friends who interned at Korean law firms during 1L summer, though they were native speakers and none of them have gone on to a career at these Korean law firms after graduation. I don't know if this was by choice, or because the firms didn't hire American JDs. You can also probably start out in a US office and transfer.   Take everything I said with a grain of salt, remember that job search is actually an incredibly individualized process despite the indistinguishability of the process itself, and do a ton of research.

You will know the rules of evidence like the back of your hand and you can say you know how to try a case."

Can cut both ways though. Mock trial members have a tendency to be over dramatic in their opening/closing/questioning, too quick to object, and over argue every facet for points. Mock Trial is not great for teaching the tact of trial and definitely does not prepare you for the terrible witnesses and clients you will encounter in the real world.  I would suggest a student practitioner at a DA/PD office if someone wants to gain trial experience. A mock trial member plays trial while a student practitioner lives it."
LawSchool,3dsxwc,rockydbull,2,Sun Jul 19 13:47:52 2015 UTC,Well yeah but isn't that a little like saying 'The best preparation for being a lawyer is being a lawyer'?

LawSchool,3dsxwc,rockydbull,1 point,Sun Jul 19 14:25:05 2015 UTC,"Okay, let me clarify here. Knowing the mechanics of trying a case because you learned them in a practical setting (like mock trial or a trial class) is the benefit I am referring to. I am not suggesting that anyone should actually conduct a real trial in the same way a mock trial student would, that would be ridiculous. Real world experience is certainly the preferred way to gain proficiency and useful knowledge. Having said that real world experience and a mock trial experience are not mutually exclusive experiences."

LawSchool,3dsxwc,HoobidyMcBoobidy,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:57:21 2015 UTC,IMO what is learned in mock trial imparts some bad habits that lean on (or go over depending on the person) the edge of negating the usefulness of the experience. A trial class is better on this scale because it is typically taught by a practicing lawyer or judge and not conducted in a competition like setting.
LawSchool,3dsxwc,rockydbull,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:29:19 2015 UTC,"There is no right answer, it all depends on what you want to do after law school.

LawSchool,3dofc7,onionmancer,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:30:23 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I don't know if any of my clients have had the wherewithal to even look me up on the internet. If they did, they would not be able to determine where I live without some financial records. I'm not personally worried."
LawSchool,3dofc7,NurRauch,4,Mon Jul 20 12:42:45 2015 UTC,"My mentor says in his 30 years as a PD he's only had 2 people attempt anything. But he's had friends who have been spit on and had clients attack them. Whats odd he says, is it wasn't the asshole PD's that got attack.  That being said, for the most part the only danger you would be in would be from someone with mental problems. And unfortunately that is the bulk of the people PD's help. Or the victims family if you do too good a job."
LawSchool,3dofc7,thelunchbox29,12,Sat Jul 18 06:14:21 2015 UTC,"Ok not a lawyer, but I worked for the PD's office in a small town for a year. Now, being a small town, pretty much everyone had a general idea of 1) who i was, 2) where i lived and 3) there were only 2 schools in the entire city my child could go to and based on where i live they would know which one. I'm also a young 20's, unmarried, female.   It is absolutely fine. Are there people I worry about? Absolutely. Did I make sure that I never walked out of the courthouse into a dark parking lot alone? Sure. (although normally whoever was there for the day walked out in a group anyway so no worries.) Did I hear A LOT of things from clients I don't want to hear - yes, I was the only female attorney in town under the age of 35 and theyd been in jail with only men for long periods of time.  But, I have never felt truly unsafe. I still go running, even in the rougher areas of town, by myself. (with a cell phone of course). I've had clients come up to talk to me at the YMCA, Walmart, my daughter's school functions, whatever. And it really wasn't a big deal.  You know who the clients you need to watch out for are. You know when a client is upset enough to possibly be a danger. But 95% of your clients would never lay a hand on you. I actually had a client threaten to beat his ""buddy"" for yelling at me as I ran down their road. Most of your clients are good people. If criminal defense is what you want to do, you need to realize that. One bad crime doesn't make them a vengeful, violent predator/attacker.   BUT, if you are nervous and you do worry about it, the criminal law is not for you. (And you don't really know until you try it. 3 years ago I would have said the same thing.) If you treat your clients like you are afraid of them or like you arent willing to share even little things with them (ex,, sure I grew up in Memphis or Yes I have a child - w/o giving the name) then you just won't be able to develop the connection and rapport you really have to have with that client and they will see you as just another part of the system that has already judged them.  Edit for TL;DR: Threats happen, but not like you would think and 95% or more of your clients would never even consider coming after you. But, if you arent ok with getting random walmart approaches from wife beaters/drunk drivers/ arsonists/ thieves, this is not the type of law for you"
LawSchool,3dofc7,lazymarathoner,30,Sat Jul 18 00:44:22 2015 UTC,You start by saying not a lawyer then go on to call yourself the only female attorney in the town. I'm confused here.
LawSchool,3dofc7,Unicorn_Ranger,26,Sat Jul 18 03:33:09 2015 UTC,nice issue spotting.
LawSchool,3dofc7,jojammin,10,Sat Jul 18 11:05:24 2015 UTC,"I was technically still a 3L working on a restricted student license, but it was a small town and I got a LOT of freedom as I worked my way up into proving I could handle it, so for many of my clients I truly was their attorney. But the distinction I was trying to make is, I'm not a fully licensed attorney speaking from 10 years experience in the business.  My bad, I realize that was unclear. 12+ hours of bar prep had fried my brain."
LawSchool,3dofc7,lazymarathoner,2,Sat Jul 18 14:39:05 2015 UTC,This was very refreshing to read as I study for the bar.
LawSchool,3dofc7,LupeTheKiller,2,Sat Jul 18 01:37:05 2015 UTC,glad my procrastination from bar prep helped :)
LawSchool,3dofc7,lazymarathoner,3,Sat Jul 18 01:42:02 2015 UTC,"Where I worked the DA's got way more death threats than the PD's. We had a guy show up at one of our attorney's house once, with a gun."
LawSchool,3dofc7,gnf01,2,Sat Jul 18 12:25:07 2015 UTC,I was recently reading a trial transcript online of proceedings for two criminal defendants who had informed on El Chapo and the Sinola Cartel.  The lawyers names were redacted so someone thought they might be subject to some danger.  I do criminal work as an intern but most of our clients are strung out on heroin and therefore not too determined to carry out some revenge plan.
LawSchool,3dofc7,DeweyCheatamAndHowe,2,Sat Jul 18 14:06:20 2015 UTC,"It's a hard call. I work with mentally ill folks, and there have been occasions when I will take off my wedding ring or claim that I live in a different state. I also don't have Facebook or any traceable social media footprint."

LawSchool,3dofc7,barksaxa,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:51:36 2015 UTC,"I figure criminal defense is a step up from average, but still less risk than I grew up with.   My dad was a cop, at least now I'm on the same side as the alleged criminals. I won't say the bad guys, because I'm not sure who the bad guys are anymore."
LawSchool,3dofc7,stopemocide,2,Sat Jul 18 19:07:40 2015 UTC,How does your dad feel about your occupation?
LawSchool,3dofc7,areasonableusername,4,Sun Jul 19 01:35:30 2015 UTC,"He doesn't love it. Not from a safety stand point, but simply because it does put me on the opposite side. He keeps pushing me to apply for jobs with various prosecutors, and I do apply, but I don't think that is where I will end up.  Basically, we don't talk about it much. I honestly believe that if all cops were like him, the world would be a better place. He is scrupulously honest, doesn't like violence, and has never worn a pair of aviators in his life. He honestly believes that he is the norm and that his coworkers share his moral values. He won't believe anything else, because doing so would invalidate most of his life.   He does have some local defense attorneys he likes and respects. He tries to tell me what makes them different and I pay close attention. It's a small world, and I want to be respected by both sides of the aisle."
LawSchool,3dofc7,stopemocide,2,Sun Jul 19 02:22:34 2015 UTC,Thanks for sharing. I'd love to hear what makes those defense attorneys different if you have the time.
LawSchool,3dofc7,areasonableusername,3,Sun Jul 19 04:26:55 2015 UTC,"post bar exam I'll give you a longer answer, but basically it's the ones who respect personal boundaries and don't nitpick stupid things.   IE, if the detective whose name is on the evidence for chain of custody is sitting in the courtroom, don't fuss because he isn't physically holding the evidence. He can see it, he knows if anyone messes with it."
