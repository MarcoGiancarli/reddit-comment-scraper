redditsync,3dzpji,Moter8,8,Tue Jul 21 10:20:35 2015 UTC,"Just going to answer this right as nobody seems to understand it...  Reddit Sync uses an open-source library called Subsampling Scale Image View.  If you don't believe me, open Reddit Sync, open the settings, click on Other and on Licenses, scroll down and you see ""Subsampling Zoom Image View, the owner renamed the repo apparently  Its own description (""Highly configurable, easily extendable view with pan and zoom gestures for displaying huge images without loss of detail. Perfect for photo galleries, maps, building plans etc."") already tells you what it is, kinda.  Without this library it's very tricky to display images on Android (and to zoom into them without it crashing on low-RAM devices). It does some magic in the back, which can sometimes cause bugs such as displaying the image in greyscale only and not in color.  This library does NOT download images in lower/higher resolution at all, that is done by reddit sync itself or another library. Also, Imgur is NOT the culprit of the images showing up wrong."
redditsync,3dzpji,augustuen,6,Tue Jul 21 12:18:55 2015 UTC,"Like /u/jayl265 said, it allows you to zoom deeper.

redditsync,3dzpji,SolarLiner,1 point,Tue Jul 21 10:53:06 2015 UTC,"^ This. Exactly, what it does is that it loads a smaller version of the image, and then as you zoom in, selectively downloads parts of the original image.  Example: Take this 6044x1995 panorama of Mars made by Curiosity (2 Mb), and load it. Notice it will always be smooth if you pan, zoom in and out. Without deep zoom, your phone will struggle to show it properly because such resolutions are a pain resources-wise to work with and kills your battery faster than you can post about it.

redditsync,3dy28c,bublz,2,Mon Jul 20 17:58:28 2015 UTC,"From its description:   The view optionally uses subsampling and tiles to support very large images - a low resolution base layer is loaded and as you zoom in, it is overlaid with smaller high resolution tiles for the visible area. This avoids holding too much data in memory. It's ideal for displaying large images while allowing you to zoom in to the high resolution details. You can disable tiling for smaller images and when displaying a bitmap object. There are some advantages and disadvantages to disabling tiling so to decide which is best, see the wiki.   Basically, it does some magic which can sometimes cause bugs. People should report the bugs at the library's repo and NOT here."
redditsync,3dy28c,Moter8,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:21:36 2015 UTC,"Oh okay.  Thanks a lot for posting that.  I just assumed that Sync for Reddit was downloading the image file, then doing some stupid algorithm to make the filesize smaller.  This clears that up."
redditsync,3dy28c,bublz,2,Tue Jul 21 22:14:49 2015 UTC,Deepzoom resamples the image when you deepzoom. Meaning it literally asks the website for another higher def version of the image. Imugr's compression algorithms may have decided that the best way to make the image smaller is to turn it grayscale or something weird. Automated compression is actually really tricky.

redditsync,3dthnk,Lpbo,45,Sun Jul 19 08:20:25 2015 UTC,"My solution would be to have the UI only appear once the picture is tapped, so that it doesn't take up vital screen space. When the UI does appear, it should be overlaid over the image, not cause the image to shrink.   The ads should also be overlaid over the image, rather than cropping out screen space."

redditsync,3dthnk,10000_Spoons_Irony,9,Sun Jul 19 15:24:34 2015 UTC,That's good to hear. I just view all images on the mobile imgur site since that handles the sizes and albums better (IMHO).
redditsync,3dthnk,Agent_McMuffin,2,Sun Jul 19 13:05:13 2015 UTC,Yeah I have premium so no ads but even with just the ui its pretty bad.
redditsync,3dthnk,thang1thang2,3,Sun Jul 19 23:03:53 2015 UTC,"The main driving idea behind the UI/UX of Sync for Reddit is to build a reddit app that conforms as much as possible to the design guidelines of Google. Because of that, I would probably just use immersive mode for all images (portrait and landscape). The benefit of that is that you can keep the tap to dismiss behavior the same and just swipe from an edge to bring up the UI.  I think removing the bottom bar and sticking the options into the 3 dot menu would also be good for removing space. The toolbar on the top can also contain several different icons. I think it might look much better if the top toolbar was themed with the app and looked material and had maybe a few of the buttons currently in the bottom toolbar while putting the rest in the three dot menu. (Maybe stick an option in the settings to pick which two out of four buttons you want on the toolbar and put the rest in the three dot menu)  Doing that would remove pretty much all of the extra space possible to remove while removing none of the functionality. Ads shouldn't be overlaid over the image because then they can potentially crop part of the image out of view. As it is right now, the ads are about as well placed and well designed as they can be."
redditsync,3dthnk,HJGamer,4,Sun Jul 19 20:42:59 2015 UTC,"Informative post with good ideas. I still believe overlaying the ad is a good solution. Viewing the part of the image hidden by the ad  could be done by zooming out until the image does not extend to the bottom of the screen covered by the ad, or by swiping upwards, making the bottom image scroll up above the ad."

redditsync,3dthnk,zombies8mybrain,26,Sun Jul 19 15:13:15 2015 UTC,Being ad-free makes about 20px difference. You still get the huge black bars top and bottom.
redditsync,3dthnk,thepineapplehea,-2,Sun Jul 19 17:06:22 2015 UTC,"I'm not saying that UI is better without the ads, but you can't complain and make demands/requests of a dev you don't support. Now if he had actually bought the app, that I'm sure OP uses many hours a day, then he would be in a position to make requests."
redditsync,3dthnk,AltansarSpiritseer,6,Sun Jul 19 17:14:39 2015 UTC,That is true. It just seems like any time this topic comes up a lot of the responses are 'go pro to lose ads' - I wonder how many people saying that have bought Pro as well?

redditsync,3dq7q7,Technikderp,2,Sat Jul 18 14:23:18 2015 UTC,"I have a similar problem  Using the YouTube app, videos sporadically stop playing and instead it says, an error occurred, tap to try again. If this happens, redditsync also doesn't work. The video begins to load. Tries to play. Then loads again and keeps in going like this. Twitch also doesn't work then. The problem can begin either in redditsync or in the YouTube app but never started in the twitch app.  I have to reboot my phone every time this happens. Then it works for some minutes.   I don't know what to do anymore. Have been searching everywhere and don't find any fixes.   Got an Nexus 4 with the newest stock lollipop build with newest Franco kernel. These errors occur for some weeks/months now."

redditsync,3d9iel,TboxLive,46,Tue Jul 14 22:22:22 2015 UTC,Deep zoom is disabled by default for this very reason. It works great on large infographics but fails on some more common images.

redditsync,3d9iel,emarkd,3,Tue Jul 14 21:02:59 2015 UTC,That's just how the library works I'm afraid.  https://github.com/davemorrissey/subsampling-scale-image-view
redditsync,3d9iel,ljdawson,2,Sat Jul 18 17:21:56 2015 UTC,Thank you for the answer.  That looks like a very clever image view.  Too bad it's underlying library has those unresolved bugs.
redditsync,3d9iel,emarkd,15,Sat Jul 18 17:47:39 2015 UTC,Can you trigger the feature based on image resolution or proportions?
redditsync,3d9iel,massDiction,13,Tue Jul 14 22:13:20 2015 UTC,Out of curiosity what does deep zoom do that is so fancy that it can cause these issues? I'm a dev too.
redditsync,3d9iel,onthefence928,2,Tue Jul 14 23:15:06 2015 UTC,It uses a custom decoder that has these issues.

There's probably easier tools to use for the job, but tasker is probably the most powerful once you've got it figured out.  Check out /r/tasker, they know more than me.  But basically all I did was setup was setup a net based location near my work, and linked a task to set my ringer and notification and media volume to 0.  And an exit task to put ringer volume to 4.  There's a few different location options, the net one isn't super accurate but eats less battery than GPS location.  I find it usually triggers within the first 5 minutes of being at work.  I actually have a couple of profiles for work that work together, since I don't want my media volume set to 0 while headphones are plugged in (my car uses headphone aux jack)."

redditsync,3cwzxy,sirmanleypower,10,Sun Jul 12 00:07:25 2015 UTC,"Exactly, I just hope this feature will be general enough to use whatever your default browser is.  If not it's certainly a clever way to get more people using Chrome when most apps will have a hard dependency on it. I do wonder if it gracefully falls back to intents if Chrome isn't installed."
redditsync,3cwzxy,Spivak,7,Sun Jul 12 00:22:14 2015 UTC,"Chrome Tab is specifically a feature of Chrome. I don't think it would work with other browsers, though I'm sure if you don't have Chrome installed it would either open your default browser or fall back to the standard Android web view."
redditsync,3cwzxy,swissarmychris,0,Sun Jul 12 00:29:14 2015 UTC,"Essentially replacing webviews (which will stick around). Apple launched this as well for iOS 9. Things like cookies, passwords and extensions (eventually) carry over inside of apps. So browsing apps like Twitter and Reddit will be much more cohesive if you get kicked to a site you visit often."

redditsync,3coebc,n_body,10,Fri Jul 10 02:26:58 2015 UTC,"However I bet those devs do not have the type of community that we have here for sync. Also, it's better to get started earlier than later for this type of thing. And frankly, the boats app for voat absolutely sucks."
redditsync,3coebc,KmatthewC,7,Thu Jul 9 19:31:57 2015 UTC,"The apps like boats sucks because voat has a very shitty api in the moment. They plan to release a api v2, which makes it possibly to develop a good working app."
redditsync,3coebc,l3d00m,8,Thu Jul 9 20:02:26 2015 UTC,"The app sucks because the UI is terrible. I don't mind missing features because it's understandable with the current API. I do mind a clunky and ugly UI, though, because that's entirely the devs shortcoming.  Ninja edit: this goes for both Voat apps, really."
redditsync,3coebc,TheRealKidkudi,2,Fri Jul 10 02:34:40 2015 UTC,"For now, voBrowser is pretty good, although a Sync for Voat app would be much better"
redditsync,3coebc,SOD03,1 point,Sun Jul 12 13:14:05 2015 UTC,"Is that a new app? It looks nice, I'll have to give it a shot. I hadn't seen it until now."
redditsync,3coebc,TheRealKidkudi,1 point,Sun Jul 12 15:09:15 2015 UTC,"Yeah, its what I'll use until Sync for Voat comes out, if it comes out."
redditsync,3coebc,SOD03,4,Sun Jul 12 15:19:27 2015 UTC,Which is understandable. But regardless of this I think it's a good idea to get into the market for voat because the design of sync is great. Apply that to an app for voat with an already established following and you've got yourself a formula for (at least mild) success.
redditsync,3coebc,KmatthewC,0,Thu Jul 9 20:17:24 2015 UTC,"Never spent any time with boats. I did use versa for awhile. It seemed to work fine, although I haven't really been back on voat for about a month."
redditsync,3coebc,dare_you_to_be_real,2,Thu Jul 9 20:31:21 2015 UTC,You would make me stop using reddit if it worked for voat
redditsync,3coebc,TheSingleChain,23,Thu Jul 9 19:19:09 2015 UTC,"I would use the hell out of it. I've been using Boats lately, and it is a serious downgrade from how amazing Reddit Sync is, to the point where I have just been using their mobile site. If I could use Voat Sync (or whatever) I would buy the hell out of that app."
redditsync,3coebc,keeganspeck,10,Thu Jul 9 15:54:08 2015 UTC,Isn't the fucking goat on every goddamn row annoying as hell? We really need a good Material app for Voat.

redditsync,3coebc,Rachmaninov43,69,Sat Jul 11 00:50:40 2015 UTC,"I honestly think it would be a bad move. I know it is the popular opinion that reddit might be a sinking ship but I think it takes much more to take it down. If you look at google trends the hype for voat has allready droped down a lot. And if you take a look at alexa to compare the visitor numbers it just isn't even comparable (voat shows to have fewer visitors than a week ago there too)  It is possible that we see reddit going down slowly. But I just don't believe it. There was a (hype-)hate-train last week, that is sure. And not everything is perfect with this platform.  But people have settled here now. It is going to take quiet a lot of dramas for voat to grow.  So why do I advice against doing an app for it? It just isn't worth it. Redditsync might suffer in the process and with all the alternatives we have for apps I think that you could quickly fall behind (even though you are ahead now). I think people might be jumping to another app quicker than they might be going to voat. I just thought I'd give a counterpoint to all the postive answers I saw here. In the end we know nothing for sure and it is down for your decision.  Oh and I know this is reddit and you all gonna want sources for my statements:  http://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/voat.co http://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/reddit.com https://www.google.com/trends/explore#q=voat&date=today%201-m&cmpt=q&tz=Etc%2FGMT-2"
redditsync,3coebc,akafallenhero,5,Thu Jul 9 15:39:03 2015 UTC,It would give the dev more money with ads or a pro version. And it's good to brand out. Sync for Voat is a great idea.
redditsync,3coebc,chromeand,9,Thu Jul 9 20:11:54 2015 UTC,I unterstand the idea. The probleme I see is the time it's gonna take. The reddit app would surely suffer from it. And if users switch to another reddit app because of that it wouldn't be worth it.   It is the same logic with not doing an app for Windows phone. Sure it would get new users but would that be worth the time used for it? Even bigger companys dodged that platform for that reason. I know this isn't the same thing. Think of it as an analogy
redditsync,3coebc,akafallenhero,7,Thu Jul 9 20:31:53 2015 UTC,I just looked at a few subreddit and their voat depended. It seems that all voats (? no idea how they are called) have grown a bit in the last week and show some subscribers. But the numbers of active users in the last 15 minutes is laughable. Most subreddits have around 200-500 times more active users in that timespan than the subvoats.
redditsync,3coebc,akafallenhero,9,Thu Jul 9 15:47:00 2015 UTC,"I just wanted to show how small that site still is. I am sure everybody is aware that voat is not as big as reddit.   And the most important thing in those statistics is that voat is at a hight and already losing users and interest. Sure those things can change.   Sure things can change. But as a dev I would think carefully how I dedicate my limited resources.   I mostly wanted to give a argument against doing it for the sake of a discussion.  Also I find it quiet telling that most users here say that they aren't using voat but just considering it. Everytime a site fucksup I see a load user voice calling for a change to a new site (for example facebook updating their user agreement), it just never changed something.  I could even argue that all the publicity is going to help in the long run. I see articels all over the major newssites. Many people might just be getting to know reddit. Here in germany not to many people use or know about reddit. But with sites reporting about it reddit has the highest search interest it ever had on google trends."
redditsync,3coebc,akafallenhero,8,Thu Jul 9 18:40:49 2015 UTC,One of the reasons why it isn't popular is because it doesn't have a mobile app.  It's one of those chicken and egg things I guess.
redditsync,3coebc,horrorslice,-2,Thu Jul 9 19:23:09 2015 UTC,"I mean there's a small user base, then there's 500 people in the entire world using it... For a site that everyone is jumping ship to, it isn't very populated."
redditsync,3coebc,boganhobo,0,Thu Jul 9 19:50:55 2015 UTC,Don't ask me how I did it but I thought the guy above you meant 200-500 people...       Awks.
redditsync,3coebc,boganhobo,3,Thu Jul 9 23:57:00 2015 UTC,The site hasn't been stable for current traffic let alone growing. They have been doxxed to high hell and plauged by issues. Their original web host dropped them completely with no warning. It's hard to grow a user base under the conditions they have. Reddit has had all the same issues in the past and still grew.
redditsync,3coebc,Harag5,12,Fri Jul 10 00:46:22 2015 UTC,I use reddit pretty much exclusively on mobile so I'd actually give voat a shot if you developed an app for it.
redditsync,3coebc,Metroidam11,15,Fri Jul 10 02:20:51 2015 UTC,Hell yes. More so if you left everything the same besides what needs to ba changed due to differences between the sites/APIs.
redditsync,3coebc,balducien,6,Fri Jul 10 05:29:20 2015 UTC,"I agree, if it's possible then this exact app but for Voat would be perfect."
redditsync,3coebc,thejenkmeister,4,Thu Jul 9 17:58:14 2015 UTC,"I don't plan on using Voat unless there is a massive change in circumstances. Having said that, I support any move you (ljdawson) would make, especially if it increases your brand exposure and earning potential. My only hope is that you can continue to improve sync for reddit fairly regularly even as you work on a hypothetical Voat app."
redditsync,3coebc,GinDaHood,3,Thu Jul 9 15:01:37 2015 UTC,"Reddit sync is a top shelf app. If a Voat app with similar functionality was created, i would buy a pro version."
redditsync,3coebc,bleedingjim,5,Thu Jul 9 15:37:05 2015 UTC,I would.  Mostly I live on mobile devices and lack of a good client keeps annoying me
redditsync,3coebc,BorisCJ,6,Thu Jul 9 16:15:22 2015 UTC,"I do, and a Voat app by you would be top notch."

redditsync,3coebc,Mynameisnotdoug,7,Thu Jul 9 18:35:48 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I miss the hate that Victoria spewed."
redditsync,3coebc,Trinition,0,Thu Jul 9 21:53:32 2015 UTC,Exactly. Thank god we have admins on Reddit who protect us from dangerous ideas.  Throughout history the restriction of ideas and information have done wonders for humanity.

redditsync,3coebc,DrDexterMorgan,4,Fri Jul 10 01:03:21 2015 UTC,"Yeah, admins trying to keep the site they run from being used to incite hate mobs is totally ""the restriction of ideas and information."""
redditsync,3coebc,haircut74,3,Fri Jul 10 03:37:08 2015 UTC,"I dont use it actively, I made account, I was there few times, but it lacks people, it lacks people who would send interesting content, and I am ok with only one ""reddit-type"" site - that's reddit.  by the way: people say Voat doesnt have any apps, but if you search on GP, it has  few apps and they.. look fine."
redditsync,3coebc,phespa,3,Fri Jul 10 03:48:54 2015 UTC,I use voat but the apps on the play store feel very bare bones. I would def download a voat app by you in a heartbeat.
redditsync,3coebc,ventusvir,3,Fri Jul 10 08:36:10 2015 UTC,"To be honest, I hadn't heard of voat until all of the controversy forced it in to the public eye over the past weekend, but I did try to check it out (emphasize try as the site was down).  Reddit is primarily a consumption app for me, and if there is no more good content to consume, I'd gladly follow the current user base if they started posting the good content elsewhere. That being said, Reddit Sync is one of the only apps that I would even think about using to add comments and posts to Reddit as the interface is clean and reliable.   I think making an app such as Sync for Voat could be worthwhile and could be the ""killer app"" that helps to get the platform started. Unless a good app exists to consume and contribute, users aren't going to migrate to the platform, but then again putting the cart before the horse could waste a lot of your development time.  Can you benefit at all by reusing layouts and methods from Sync for Reddit in Sync for Voat? If it's as simple as changing a couple of API keys and rewriting methods to handle different JSON responses, I'd say go for it and get it out there ASAP, I (and I think the community as well) would forgive the shortcut if it led to a usable app. If you can't reuse code, I'd probably suggest to just keep an eye on the user base to see if it seems worthwhile (LOL, I realize that is the point of this post) but also to take in to account that your excellent app milkshake may bring all the boys to the yard for you ;)  Thanks and keep up the awesome work!"
redditsync,3coebc,GmoneyKricket,3,Thu Jul 9 17:47:28 2015 UTC,"I have no interest in it at all. I'd rather you spend your time on this app, obviously. It would suck if development on this suffered for a very very niche product."
redditsync,3coebc,Mynameisnotdoug,6,Thu Jul 9 18:03:03 2015 UTC,How about an app that aggregates both sites :-)
redditsync,3coebc,allinfinite,5,Thu Jul 9 22:17:59 2015 UTC,I'd use it.
redditsync,3coebc,Trolltaku,3,Fri Jul 10 04:24:24 2015 UTC,I'm actually really glad you weren't picked up to be the Android dev at Reddit for the official Reddit app. I was really disappointed that RS wasn't going to be the official app at first but now you get to do things like make a Voat app if you want!  I say follow the crowd and make some money along the way. Make something nice for the Voat users. I will buy every version of Voat Sync that you release.
redditsync,3coebc,UndeadWaffles,-1,Fri Jul 10 03:33:01 2015 UTC,"""Follow the crowd""?  That means stay here, you realize, don't you?  Voat is hardly a crowd."
redditsync,3coebc,Mynameisnotdoug,2,Thu Jul 9 16:02:04 2015 UTC,Are we not in the same comment thread or something? There seems to be quite a few people here that would like a Voat app. I didn't say give up on the Reddit app. I just would like to see a Voat app. There is no reason both can't exist as long as the dev can handle them both.
redditsync,3coebc,UndeadWaffles,1 point,Thu Jul 9 20:13:02 2015 UTC,"If you think voat is following the crowd, by all means believe that.  The user counts would disagree.  A bunch of like minded people in this one thread tend to want a voat app.  There are 30k subscribers in this subreddit.  Does voat even have 30k users, in total?"
redditsync,3coebc,Mynameisnotdoug,2,Fri Jul 10 04:52:50 2015 UTC,"Well, I'm glad you asked. As far as I know, Voat doesn't have a statistics page like Reddit does right now. So I can only base this answer off the little bits of information that I'm getting from here and there. So I'm going to give you what I've found.  Now, there are a few things to consider before looking at this data:   Victoria was fired from Reddit on July 2nd and this is when all the non-sense started about boycotting Reddit altogether. In the days following her being fired, a large amount of traffic moved to Voat.co. There was so much more traffic than usual that this caused Voat's servers to completely shit the bed. The site was only up for a few minutes a few times a day because when it was up, so many people attempted to get on and create accounts that the server could not handle it all. It wasn't until Voat found funding from an outside source that they were able to come back online with much larger bandwidth and now they are pretty stable as far as servers are concerned.   Please remember that this all happened after July 2nd. Before that, Voat was a much smaller community with fairly stable servers.   On MARCH 16th, Atko posted this thread on Voat showing compiled server stats. The stats show a total of 22,345 user accounts had been created up until that point. In JUNE, Voat.co had about 3.6 million page views. That's about 120k per day. NOW, based on stats created about an hour ago from statout.com, Voat.co has 83,485 unique visitors a day and about 501k daily page views. Voat.co has gone up 48,135 page rankings in the last 3 months on Alexa.com's page rankings.   Now, considering the traffic Voat had before and also considering that it was not able to handle the amount of traffic and new user sign-ups it had after the Victoria-pocalypse, I would say that it is safe to assume that Voat.co has a lot more than 30k users. With just the data on unique page views alone, I would say that it is a good business decision for Dawson to create an app to bring in revenue from Voat's viewer base.  I know you are worried about development on Reddit Sync decreasing if an app for Voat were to be developed. This isn't something you need to worry about. Dawson has already developed a few other apps alongside the development of RS. Those are apps that needed to be created from scratch in some cases and other versions of RS that have (I can only assume) a majority of the same code. If Dawson were to create an app for Voat, it would not take much effort (it would just require some time) to port RS into a version of the app that would support Voat. The APIs will be different but the functionality of Reddit and Voat are mostly the same. Voat is nearly and identical clone to Reddit as far as how the user interacts with the site. Dawson would be able to use the same code for image handling, video handling, voting, subreddit/subverse user management, post handling, and the GUI would be nearly the same once all the API changes were made. This does not seem like a huge task for someone with the experience Dawson has to manage himself. In fact, it could bring new features to RS that would have been made during the development of the Voat app.  Dawson has shown he can handle developing multiple apps at once and it should not be overly complicated to develop and app for Voat users (as long as there isn't some insane code structure that I don't know about, of course). Voat also has the user-base that would be lucrative for Dawson, which only encourages continuing development for apps like these. It would also be a good business decision to diversify the demographic that he caters to in order to have a backup in case one or the other fails eventually. I see no reason why an app for Voat should be made and I believe Dawson is the best man possible to have as a developer on that project."
redditsync,3coebc,UndeadWaffles,1 point,Fri Jul 10 05:20:40 2015 UTC,"That's quite a wall of text.  I'd like to counterthat of the 30k subscribers to this particular subreddit, what percentage of them are in this thread saying ""yes""?  Edit: You know what?  Let's just drop it.  I'm a bit tired of a vocal 1% (if that) claiming that reddit will be a wasteland in a few weeks once Voat gets up to speed because of some drama that only that 1% cares about.  I'm out."
redditsync,3coebc,Mynameisnotdoug,2,Fri Jul 10 14:01:33 2015 UTC,"Ok! So out of 103 parent comments in this thread, 74 say they would use a Voat app developed by Dawson, 23 say no or that they would rather have that development time put into Reddit Sync, and 6 are neutral/did not say/didn't understand the question.  That means 71.845% vote yes and 22.330% vote no."

redditsync,3coebc,kynibe,5,Fri Jul 10 18:57:45 2015 UTC,The only reason I don't use voat as much as I want to is because there are no good voat apps. If there was one by you that would be a dream come true.

redditsync,3coebc,Iknoright,5,Thu Jul 9 14:40:28 2015 UTC,Just having an app ready to go in case Voat really does kick off would probably be a good idea. You'd be one of the first players with a decent app. But not if it takes a substantial amount of time away from your primary userbase (reddit).  EDIT: voat support in reddit sync could be cool - even if it only allows you to view content and nothing else (like as an IAP or something).

There is a little content but it's not great. I have no interest in voat until it grows into something more usable.   If you want to make a voat app, I say go for it. You'd be breaching a market mostly left open. Apparently the voat APIs aren't as good yet but with time they'll get better.  If you manage to put out a clone of Sync for Reddit, but as ""Sync for Voat"", I'd buy it right away and wait until I can enjoy that site.

redditsync,3coebc,GobtheCyberPunk,2,Thu Jul 9 17:14:48 2015 UTC,Voat is too similar to reddit and this whole thing is just a faze IMO. If you have free time go ahead but I wouldn't invest too much into it
redditsync,3coebc,nivadia274,2,Fri Jul 10 04:36:37 2015 UTC,I don't use Voat. Its never loaded anytime I've tried anyways and I get the impression it's Reddit with more child porn.

Spreadit - https://spreadit.io/ - Uses reddit's open source codebase, but in a darker theme.  Snapzu - http://snapzu.com/ - Invite only (but there are invites everywhere?) Unique functionality takes some getting used to. Some people swear by it, others can't seem to ""get it"".  Empeopled - http://empeopled.com/ - Karma is not just a meaningless number here. It represents influence over the future of the site. Still not sure how this will play out. May be prone to even more hardcore vote gaming.  Hacker News - https://news.ycombinator.com/ - A side project of the YCombinator startup incubation program, it has a heavy focus on entrepreneurship, especially based on web technologies, but other technology news occasionally make it here. Resembles the first few years of reddit.  Slashdot - http://www.slashdot.org/ - The original tech news aggregator from the late 90s, its readership has always been smart and incisive, but its recent takeover by DICE has not done it any favors. An unsuccessful attempt at a redesign ended up with a bunch of community-sourced Slashdot clones being launched (https://pipedot.org/, https://soylentnews.org, http://technocrat.net/) and the redesign effort being rolled back.

You don't need to delete it all the time unless you're really low on space. It helps your apps open faster."
redditsync,3cogz3,Mocha_Bean,2,Fri Jul 10 01:57:36 2015 UTC,"I honestly didn't know that. To most people it would seem like a necessary app, right?   I mostly use it to clear cache every couple of days, which can get over a gig in a couple days. With my 8gb storage and it doesn't take SD cards, it seemed pretty useful to me."
redditsync,3cogz3,Silent_Shadow_117,5,Fri Jul 10 02:32:45 2015 UTC,"Ah. If you have only 8GB of storage, then a cache cleaner would probably be useful.  If you want, you can uninstall Clean Master and install this app instead.  It's much smaller (CM is 15 MB; this is 245 KB), and it performs the only useful function of Clean Master: clearing app cache.  It also can clear Dalvik cache and partition cache, but those aren't useful for freeing storage and you can't do them without root. You just want to press ""clear app cache."""
redditsync,3cogz3,Mocha_Bean,3,Fri Jul 10 03:27:10 2015 UTC,Just downloaded it and Uninstaller clean master.   Thanks!
redditsync,3cogz3,Silent_Shadow_117,2,Fri Jul 10 03:33:53 2015 UTC,"What about something like CCleaner?  I've used it on my desktop and my phones, and it seems to work?  I mean it just clears whatever I want it to clear, and tells you how much space it'll free each time."
redditsync,3cogz3,Mocha_Bean,4,Fri Jul 10 04:01:51 2015 UTC,"Yeah, CCleaner is fine, but I thought you might like that one due to its small size. Do whatever you want; I don't particularly care. :P"

I want x ads to appear when the user scrolls through a photo gallery..."" and so on. You can control the placement of the ads, when they pop up, etc., to some extent.  Every now and then there will be an ad that says ""hey, I'm a small banner add that's 100x1080 pixels"" but is actually a full page popup that's very aggressive and annoying. Those ads should be banned by the ad network in charge of the ad library, but they slip through occasionally.  * This following description is not guaranteed to be 100% pedantically correct, it's merely to get the idea across."

redditsync,3cbwe9,spennnyy,2,Tue Jul 7 01:29:58 2015 UTC,Yes but he could use something like Google Adsense which doesn't use bullshit ads like this
redditsync,3cbwe9,whizzer0,1 point,Tue Jul 7 08:16:08 2015 UTC,He probably does use Google Adsense. It's not bulletproof and stupid ads get through the filter every now and then until they're banned.
redditsync,3cbwe9,melodicsyrup,2,Tue Jul 7 14:33:52 2015 UTC,Does the developer even have the ability to blacklist certain ads?  The ads that randomly popped up in the gallery view is was pushed me to purchase the full version. So worth it seeing as I use the app at least once a day.

Possibly earlier than it does with Google's."
redditsync,3cace7,notmax,3,Mon Jul 6 18:26:09 2015 UTC,I've also experienced this. Droid Turbo and Google Keyboard. Feels like Google Keyboard may be the common factor here? I don't have Fleksy and can't test.
redditsync,3cace7,KillerBeeSting,2,Mon Jul 6 14:18:00 2015 UTC,I get this same behaviour in Reddit Sync. However I also get it in the gmail client when typing a long email. I do not think this is specific to Reddit Sync.  Pretty sure its a Google keyboard issue. Maybe I'll find a long web form to see if it happens there as well.
redditsync,3cace7,ImmortalSlacker,3,Mon Jul 6 15:54:48 2015 UTC,"It happens to me when I write long texts using Google keyboard on my OG Moto X. Though I feel like it'd probably also happen if I was using the stock keyboard, but maybe not..."
redditsync,3cace7,KillerBeeSting,2,Mon Jul 6 16:52:39 2015 UTC,"Yeah,it's odd behaviour. It definitely involves Google Keyboard. Maybe depending on how the data being typed is cached in certain apps. No clue but one component definitely is the Google Keyboard."

redditsync,3ca8zn,TJ_McHoonigan,4,Mon Jul 6 17:46:00 2015 UTC,I'm sure it's just using the file name that it loaded from the website and not the app willy nilly naming the file randomly.

In many ways, this backlash against Reddits upper echelons of governance models a real life revolution. You have a catalyst, a spark that incites dissent. Some people are out for blood and willing to tear down Reddit by abandoning it for something that they perceive to be a better alternative to the Reddit govt. While others like me, have no real say in the matter, we are apolitical, and simply wish for things to get back to the way things were before this dissension.

redditsync,3brqga,IanSan5653,10,Thu Jul 2 03:10:22 2015 UTC,It's just how Reddit works.
redditsync,3brqga,sup3rlativ3,3,Thu Jul 2 06:39:54 2015 UTC,"yes but sync is a gui for reddit and developers can put a ""saved"" button wherever they want. they aren't forced to put it under user profile like reddit.com does."
redditsync,3brqga,jiminiminimini,3,Thu Jul 2 09:22:24 2015 UTC,Why don't they make a subreddit for it? Because it didn't make sense. Conformity means that you don't need to learn each app and how it works. If you know how Reddit works you know how sync works. It's a principle for software design.
redditsync,3brqga,sup3rlativ3,4,Thu Jul 2 19:21:04 2015 UTC,"i use ifttt and save function together. when i save from sync, ifttt automatically saves the post to my pocket account. it's really nice."

redditsync,3boz7f,GinDaHood,3,Sat Jul 4 10:08:15 2015 UTC,"What do you mean by 2? And for 3, I'm sure the dev will implement something good in the upcoming material redesign."
redditsync,3boz7f,armando_rod,2,Wed Jul 1 01:30:20 2015 UTC,2 is already implemented I think

redditsync,3bmw7r,jkgao,2,Tue Jun 30 15:39:16 2015 UTC,I think there's a keyboard shortcut for RES

redditsync,3bk3k6,d3vourm3nt,20,Mon Jun 29 21:37:27 2015 UTC,"Usually that's because they end up going to the subreddit's wiki. Unfortunately, Sync doesn't support wiki links currently. Maybe this'll be fixed in the Material update?"
redditsync,3bk3k6,GiveMeOneGoodReason,8,Mon Jun 29 22:31:28 2015 UTC,Gotcha
redditsync,3bk3k6,geekamongus,3,Mon Jun 29 22:40:48 2015 UTC,"That would be really good if wiki support were added. I run a subreddit that relies on the wiki, and it sucks not being able to use it with my favorite mobile reddit app, Sync."
redditsync,3bk3k6,GinDaHood,2,Tue Jun 30 00:00:59 2015 UTC,Wiki support has been on the issue tracker for a long time. Hopefully the dev can figure out how to effectively implement it.

redditsync,3bk3k6,pikaribbon,2,Wed Jul 1 01:43:30 2015 UTC,Wiki support would be GREAT. Reddit's wikis are one of the most useful resources on the internet.
redditsync,3bk3k6,mightymaus,1 point,Wed Jul 1 11:58:19 2015 UTC,What's the alternative for the time being? It's frustrating not being able to read wikis via the app.   The only thing to do is open the subreddit in the browser?
redditsync,3bjzla,Robot_Ross,1 point,Mon Jun 29 21:06:23 2015 UTC,I believe this is a known issue that the dev is looking into.
redditsync,3bh8hl,ASmileOnTop,13,Mon Jun 29 05:04:48 2015 UTC,Add this to the issue tracker.  Edit: Did it myself.
redditsync,3bh8hl,GinDaHood,3,Mon Jun 29 05:40:12 2015 UTC,I believe this will be in the material update.
redditsync,3bh8hl,Piovertau,1 point,Mon Jun 29 17:11:16 2015 UTC,Isn't it material already?
redditsync,3bh8hl,Allavaz,6,Mon Jun 29 17:52:45 2015 UTC,Kinda. The next big update will have this. If you go back through dawson's posts in this sub you can find some sneak peaks.
redditsync,3bh8hl,Piovertau,3,Mon Jun 29 18:27:26 2015 UTC,Do you mean 'Sneak Peek'?

redditsync,3bh8hl,Piovertau,3,Mon Jun 29 18:28:43 2015 UTC,This. My biggest annoyance after switching to Sync was the fact that modmail from many months/years ago bombarded me as new. Kept getting new modmail alerts for old mail.

redditsync,3bk24m,massifjb,2,Mon Jun 29 21:27:24 2015 UTC,Frequent crashes on my S5 as well. I submit a crash report whenever it prompts me to.  I can't find a common link between all the crashes. It feels random.

redditsync,3bk24m,GinDaHood,2,Tue Jun 30 00:19:08 2015 UTC,Latest Pro one. 10.7.21.
redditsync,3bk24m,taario,1 point,Tue Jun 30 00:56:10 2015 UTC,"There's a newer one out, 10.7.21. Not sure if it addressed the crashes but worth trying."

redditsync,3bk24m,ljdawson,3,Mon Jun 29 22:51:40 2015 UTC,I've had several crashes after today's update. Happens after a link opens in the built in browser. Images and YouTube videos work fine though
redditsync,3bk24m,UJ95x,2,Mon Jun 29 23:44:10 2015 UTC,"I actually wasn't, I just updated it. Will report back if crashing continues."
redditsync,3bk24m,taario,2,Mon Jun 29 22:53:13 2015 UTC,"After today's update, I had a crash immediately after it by opening the app and tapping on comments for a post. Nothing since then though. Fingers crossed.  Edit: Still having the crashes. :/"
redditsync,3bk0il,nawanawa,14,Mon Jun 29 21:13:43 2015 UTC,This release is just a stepping stone on the route to the new material redesign. Shouldn't be too much longer!
redditsync,3bkwe2,jkgao,3,Tue Jun 30 01:35:13 2015 UTC,Nope

redditsync,3bgjaq,madboymatt,3,Mon Jun 29 00:59:10 2015 UTC,maybe disable the in-app youtube player (settings>link handling)? or enable it if it's disabled for you.

I'm going to keep typing a long reply here just to see if it will actually still prevent the lag.  I was getting really bad lag as well, and it was the only thing I could think of that had changed before it started happening. So perhaps if you have dictionary sync on, then it could be causing the problem, but I don't know for definite.  I'm this far into my reply and it hasn't been lagging for me, whereas before, any typing of this length would cause really bad lagging.  Hope my long explanation helps!"
redditsync,3bf3eq,legitwantdis,2,Sun Jun 28 22:43:37 2015 UTC,Thanks. But honestly it has to be somehow fixed by the developer. I mean it also works in WhatsApp flawlessly...

redditsync,3bc0ep,navjot94,2,Sat Jun 27 23:03:03 2015 UTC,"Kinda off-topic but a couple of years ago (like pre-reddit sync era) everyone would complain about how there were no good reddit apps for Android while Alien Blue on iOS was so nice. I remember at one point, people considered reddit sync to Android, what Alien Blue was to iOS. Interesting how that has changed."
redditsync,3bc0ep,IdkwtS,1 point,Mon Jun 29 12:58:24 2015 UTC,"I noted this as well. I was browsing /r/apple while searching for an alternative to AB and one thread was titled ""Why are reddit apps for iOS so bad?""

redditsync,3bc0ep,navjot94,1 point,Mon Jun 29 15:23:57 2015 UTC,I'm pretty sure Flow came out after reddit sync. Prior to reddit sync it  was Reddit is Fun or Reddit News (now Relay for reddit). This was about 3-4 years ago AFAIR.

redditsync,3b5y4m,ljdawson,47,Fri Jun 26 20:51:32 2015 UTC,This is caused by your ad blocker.

redditsync,3b5y4m,1stonepwn,3,Sat Jun 27 05:17:10 2015 UTC,I've also started getting it without an ad blocker
redditsync,3b5y4m,ljdawson,4,Sat Jun 27 13:31:33 2015 UTC,Sometimes it can be caused by switching from wifi to wireless.
redditsync,3b5y4m,1stonepwn,2,Sat Jun 27 23:21:23 2015 UTC,"My proxy was actually still configured from when I had an adblocker on my old phone, I fixed it"
redditsync,3b5y4m,ljdawson,4,Sun Jun 28 01:54:34 2015 UTC,So it was the adblocker setup after all?
redditsync,3b5y4m,1stonepwn,0,Sun Jun 28 11:05:26 2015 UTC,"Well, it was the proxy setting but I had that proxy setting because I had an adblocker"
redditsync,3b5y4m,ljdawson,7,Sun Jun 28 15:15:11 2015 UTC,The ad blocker is causing the issue. I'd rather focus on developing the app then supporting third party apps.
redditsync,3b5y4m,Mynameisnotdoug,2,Fri Jun 26 17:40:08 2015 UTC,"True, but I see this behavior in other apps as well, so it's not on this particular app developer to fix it."
redditsync,3b5y4m,Devian50,2,Fri Jun 26 17:47:48 2015 UTC,Honestly it is a flaw in all the other apps it happens in as well. HTML is by nature supposed to be able to load with missing parts. There's no reason to report a bigger error than there really is. It just causes confusion on the part of the user as this thread is evidence of.

redditsync,3b43m7,BoringHusband,1 point,Fri Jun 26 06:38:10 2015 UTC,I suppose that's up to the developer. I'd imagine image sizes are available in the metadata and that you don't need to actually download an image to know the size. I could be wrong though.

redditsync,3ay394,inate71,29,Wed Jun 24 12:56:20 2015 UTC,Congrats Dr. Dawson! I love your app. Keep up the good work!
redditsync,3ay394,WalkinGhost,24,Wed Jun 24 13:15:00 2015 UTC,"So Dr. Dawson, I've been dealing with this rash that doesn't seem to be going away. I'd post a photo in this comment but it's in a kinda NSFW spot.. I'll PM it instead.  I will anxiously await your advice. Thanks very much."
redditsync,3ay394,thelostdolphin,42,Wed Jun 24 16:39:34 2015 UTC,Unless your rash pertains to parallel processing I'm afraid I'm the wrong sort of Dr!
redditsync,3ay394,Natanael_L,13,Wed Jun 24 16:45:47 2015 UTC,"Well, he wants to know if he can scratch it with multiple fingers. Parallelized enough? Any suggestions on how to achieve maximum efficiency and ensure proper load balancing?"

redditsync,3ay394,The_MarBeanEz,22,Thu Jun 25 00:23:45 2015 UTC,"The struggle is real... I'm finishing mine up by August 1 and the stress is hitting hard!  Can't wait to see the new changes, though I should probably stay away from reddit for a few weeks."
redditsync,3ay394,The_MarBeanEz,24,Wed Jun 24 13:07:28 2015 UTC,Handing in the thesis by August? Good luck! It becomes a bit of a sprint towards the end!
redditsync,3ay394,1chriis1,11,Wed Jun 24 13:12:33 2015 UTC,"I've been publishing as I go along, so it will mostly be a matter of reformatting for the school. I still have to write the intro, though. Not to mention that I'm still finishing some experiments... This should get interesting."

redditsync,3ay394,Tokihanate,10,Wed Jun 24 14:35:31 2015 UTC,What prompted you to go after a phd? Curious because I'm in school for my BSc now.
redditsync,3ay394,anonymous-bot,5,Wed Jun 24 19:12:13 2015 UTC,Most people that pursue doctoral degrees so if our of a passion for the subject.

redditsync,3b3nzr,asaini007,1 point,Thu Jun 25 18:28:24 2015 UTC,"That's a monospace font, so it looks to me like the person who wrote the post had 4 leading spaces on that line of text.    4 leading spaces will cause reddit to interpret that line as code and will format it as such.   Here is an example."
redditsync,3b3nzr,sd271,1 point,Thu Jun 25 19:37:51 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the reply, I see. In your example though the Reddit website also recognizes that it should be formatted as monospace, but in my linked example, if viewed on the web, it is not formatted as such. Should sync still be interpreting it this way?"
redditsync,3b3nzr,sd271,1 point,Thu Jun 25 20:17:02 2015 UTC,"Ah, I didn't know the detail about it not rendering as code when viewed online.  That lends much more credence to the bug theory.   Hopefully they look into it!"
redditsync,3b0lfk,ibyrd,5,Thu Jun 25 00:28:24 2015 UTC,"Yeah they're incredibly frustrating because they seem to open randomly, for me anyway"
redditsync,3b0lfk,-insignificant-,4,Thu Jun 25 07:27:31 2015 UTC,Maybe buy the app? Support the Dev?
redditsync,3b0lfk,Ballsnaps,3,Thu Jun 25 12:56:32 2015 UTC,I bought the app a while ago as I hate ads. Money well spent.

redditsync,3axs8w,SpajX,5,Wed Jun 24 11:14:40 2015 UTC,Same for me.  Never used to crash before.
redditsync,3axs8w,DiscipleOfAltair,2,Wed Jun 24 11:50:50 2015 UTC,I get crash whenever I try to open something in external browser I am on nexus 4 5.1.1.

redditsync,3b0sg9,destroyman1337,4,Thu Jun 25 01:28:13 2015 UTC,I think this might be an issue with the reddit site itself. In your post I see the number 1 (first example) but in the comment source I see you typed 500.
redditsync,3b0sg9,anonymous-bot,1 point,Thu Jun 25 02:58:33 2015 UTC,It's a reddit-side issue.

redditsync,3b0sg9,okayyyyyyyyyyyy,1 point,Thu Jun 25 15:04:34 2015 UTC,This is an issue with markdown. Unless reddit decides to fork it (is Markdown open source?) it will be a problem forever.

redditsync,3avf6a,skyflyer747,24,Tue Jun 23 20:36:35 2015 UTC,"I may be in the minority, but I'd prefer not to do two actions to upvote/downvote. I'm all for this so long as there's a view that keeps upvotes and downvotes within easy reach. That's why I use the small cards view right now."
redditsync,3avf6a,jwhatts,9,Wed Jun 24 02:16:28 2015 UTC,"It already takes two clicks to upvote/down ote in list view. This idea just cleans it up a little, maybe it could just be ""swipe left to up vote"" instead..."
redditsync,3avf6a,jwhatts,5,Wed Jun 24 02:29:06 2015 UTC,"You're right, I was mistaken. However, I do love the idea of ""swipe to vote."" Interesting options for animations there."
redditsync,3avf6a,rauldzmartin,16,Wed Jun 24 03:12:11 2015 UTC,This is the kind of gestures that make me prefer Relay over Sync.
redditsync,3avf6a,h_zee13,8,Tue Jun 23 22:51:20 2015 UTC,Yeah same here. I love what Sync looks like but the gesture controls of Relay are just better in my opinion.
redditsync,3avf6a,rauldzmartin,5,Wed Jun 24 00:20:37 2015 UTC,"Yes, they just achieve a better experience, more natural."
redditsync,3avf6a,mbirth,1 point,Wed Jun 24 01:07:04 2015 UTC,"Not to forget the ""pull action bar down to load website"" gesture."
redditsync,3avf6a,gearee,1 point,Wed Jun 24 07:57:18 2015 UTC,Nah I can't stand that feature. It makes the app look really inconsistent. Sync's beta feature where you slide right to load content is better imo
redditsync,3avf6a,godly967,1 point,Wed Jun 24 08:35:23 2015 UTC,"I like this better. If relay had the vote buttons on the right instead of the left it would be a lot better. I usually use my phone in my right hand, and because it's the note series phone it gets annoying to reach over after swiping to vote."
redditsync,3avf6a,anonymous-bot,13,Sun Jun 28 13:35:14 2015 UTC,It looks similar to how Relay works and I actually like it.

redditsync,3avf6a,FirestarPwns,2,Wed Jun 24 04:45:46 2015 UTC,I like your idea. Definitely feel like the list view needs a revamp - it's been neglected for a while.
redditsync,3avf6a,rolandsdrktower,6,Tue Jun 23 22:42:15 2015 UTC,It's going to be in the 2nd stage redesign.
redditsync,3avf6a,navjot94,2,Tue Jun 23 23:01:12 2015 UTC,Sweet! Looking forward to it.
redditsync,3avf6a,naalty,1 point,Tue Jun 23 23:17:11 2015 UTC,"Hmm, not sure how well this would work in practice but something similar to this where the length of your swipe changes your action would be cool.   Like you swipe until you see upvote and let go. That would upvote the post.   Swiping more until you see downvote would allow you to downvote. Etc, etc."
redditsync,3avf6a,robochicken11,0,Wed Jun 24 14:48:03 2015 UTC,This is confusing as a vertical swipe is usually used to remove an item from a list.
redditsync,3avf6a,naalty,1 point,Wed Jun 24 15:24:13 2015 UTC,That's normally with cards though
