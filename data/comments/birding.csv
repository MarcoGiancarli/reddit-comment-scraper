birding,3e3xvm,johnnie_ornithology,7,Tue Jul 21 19:41:27 2015 UTC,"Cape May is a great spot, as of July 1st a White Ibis was spotted there, but there's so much in the Cape May area you could spend most of your birding there! The Ibis was the most recent rare bird posted for that area, it's possible something could come in while you are here so make sure and monitor this twitter account from the Cape May Bird Observatory which will give you a decent idea of what's going on in the area.  Pelagics, birds of prey, warblers, other passerines can all be found in the area, plus there are decent trails and parks to walk in and around Cape May.    For your future travel plans!  You really really really need to come to Cape May in the Fall, specifically in the first two weeks of October, sometimes even starting at the end of September when the migration starts!!  For Cape May, the geography of the land sort of forms a funnel for the many species traveling south and a huge concentration ends up passing in CLOSE range of birders that will flock to the area for migration(just like the birds!). So yea, come back in the Fall too!"
birding,3e3xvm,canneddan,2,Tue Jul 21 21:40:02 2015 UTC,"Thank you so much for the tips! Sounds great. I'll definitely try to come back in a few months to catch the migrating birds.   My most desired bird is to see a Common Loon, which apparently I can see during the winter along the East Coast and the Chesapeake, but they won't have their beautiful breeding plumage. Might have to trek farther north during the summer at some point."
birding,3e3xvm,canneddan,2,Tue Jul 21 21:50:53 2015 UTC,"Just another note, if you do get some storms while you're there, don't stop birding!  If you can find a sheltered area during or shortly after the storm you have a good chance at seeing yaegers!(The storms tend to drive them closer to shore where we can see them)  The most common is the Parasitic, but it is possible to get all three(long tailed and pomarine) if you watch the rips and follow the other birds, look for particularly aggressive behavior and really fast birds.  Also, you will probably need bins with a power of 8-10 to see those guys semi-clearly, they like to hang farther out.  Ultimately a spotting scope will be something you want, but may have to save up for, unless you already have one!"

birding,3e3xvm,smeeg101,2,Tue Jul 21 21:51:14 2015 UTC,"This is the right time of year if you want to sneak a peek at Piping Plovers, Least Terns, and Oystercatchers in Sandy Hook.  There will be roped off areas on most of the beaches.  If you go on the weekend, chat up the sunburnt intern next to the rope near the water.  They can tell you which beaches are most active for each species.  There are probably also tons of tiny adorable baby terns and plovers, some of the world's cutest chicks.    Then hike up the trail to North Beach, where on a lucky day, you'll see pretty much every species of tern, heron, egret, sandpiper, and pelican possible for the area.  Ok, most likely no Brown Pelican, but we did see one up there once.  It hung out for a couple days before going on its way.    On the shore side you may get lucky and find some Ruddy Turnstones, but I think they show up a little earlier in the year.    Take a walk down the boardwalk for some warblers.  Earlier in the year is better for them, but plenty are still there singing.  Walk down any of the cement paths for more than 100 yards and see and hear more freaking Grey Catbirds than you've ever wanted to deal with ever.  Anything that sounds interesting or out of the ordinary in those bushes is probably a Grey Catbird mimicking something, just to warn you.    There are also a ton of 20' or so high poles with a platform on top.  These are nesting platforms for Osprey.  There are probably awkward teenager Osprey in those nests right now.  You should see tons if you look for them.   Birding in Sandy Hook is just easy mode.  Even better if you can get in on one of New Jersey Audubon Society's outings to the area.  Super friendly and informative."

birding,3dzih1,pananan,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:55:24 2015 UTC,How long after you put it up before you saw more than 1-2 types of birds per day? And do the birds get scared off when they realize you're behind the screen? the setup I have is about 10ft away from my big clear glass window (about 4ftx4ft) so I wonder if me standing next to the window makes birds avoid coming to the feeder as much.
birding,3dzih1,paisleyterror,3,Tue Jul 21 04:21:45 2015 UTC,"It might also be the time of year. If it's hot, rainy, or both where you are, then suet can quickly become rancid in the summer. I'd recommend putting it back up in the fall."

When birds are ready to leave the nest, their bodies and wings will be fully feathered (and their tails are usually just a little stub, waiting to grow in more). At 5 days, you probably have a pretty naked little guy - not ready to be out of the nest yet. Pop 'em back in; they'll be happy to be fed and be attended by their parents!  Thanks for checking :)"

You can also introduce bird-friendly landscaping."
birding,3dsc2i,asomrof,4,Sun Jul 19 00:00:57 2015 UTC,"In the early stages of backyard bird feeding patience can't be stressed enough. It's a very peculiar hobby in that way: you buy your feeder and maybe a pole set up, you get the seed, you put it all up in the perfect spot, sit down in a comfy chair aaaannnndd...wait. ""Where the hell are my birds? I'm feeding they should be eating!"" It's all good, it happens. I'd give it around two weeks before being concerned regarding activity.   As for the seed, I'm not personally familiar with Wagner's Greatest, but if it's something you can get at a Walmart or Hardware store, I'd be at least skeptical. Those blends have a tendency to be filled with a lot (sometimes 70%+) of filler seed (grass seed, milo, rape seed) that song birds simply won't eat. If you don't have access to something like a Wild Birds Unlimited or Wild Bird Center, you'd be best served buying only black oil sunflower or safflower. A 50/50 blend of just those two seeds is my personal favorite for backyard feeding."

I have it in a tray feeder and a hanging feeder, and a lot of birds seem to like to eat the ones that fall to the ground.  Just be vigilant about mowing and about raking away the fallen ones or you'll have literally hundreds of sunflowers trying to grow from what the birds miss.  With black oil sunflower and thistle I've seen brown cowbirds, bluejays, common grackles, mourning doves, european sparrows, starlings, (those last two you really can't get away from,) house finches and the occasional robin who seems to just come over and see what the hubbub is all about.  I live in the middle of my smallish town though, there's probably more in the country."

If he stays interested in birding for very long, he's going to want to upgrade pretty soon. There is a pretty big quality gap between the $50 range and the $300 range. But those would be better when he's old enough to take care of them. Most young birders will need lighter, smaller bino's like these 6x30's that I would recommend. They're $89.00 with free shipping. Also, a field guide would be really helpful. Or if he has a tablet or smart phone they have some great birding apps like iBird Pro. Good luck!"

It sounds like she just left the nest and is overwhelmed.

After a few sips he would flit over to different plants and things, hover there for a couple seconds to check them out, then back to the feeder for a few more sips. He did this for a minute or so as I stood there and watched him.  Most birds startle pretty easily and will fly off if you're around, but hummers mostly don't care."

I had the cheaper model and they were awesome, just ordered the ed3's last week and am waiting for them to arrive. I've heard nothing but great things.  Edit: Additionally, FOV of view makes a huge difference, in my opinion. I didn't realize how important it was until I went from using my old Zen-Rays for years (wide FOV), to a pair of Vanguard Endeavors. The Endeavors produced a very bright, clear image, but I ended up returning them because of the more narrow FOV. It just makes it so much easier to find, track, and identify birds when you can see more. If you don't go with the Zen-Rays, def still go for a wide FOV."

I wouldn't recommend trying to buy one because they're expensive and often sold only by specialty companies.   One thing you can try is to lure in the bird somewhere by playing a recording of a robin. If it's a male it will swoop in towards the song, thinking it's another male invading the territory.  Your best bet, though, is to call your local wildlife rehabber. They might have someone with the proper equipment, or they might be able to give some suggestions specific to your situation. It can be quite tricky to safely handle wild birds if you don't have the experience or knowledge of the proper technique. Hope this helps!"

I drove up to Provincetown MA twice and walked miles up and down the beach to only be disappointed. After reviewing the photos I took I saw two black birds with similar features in the background of a picture of a Northern Gannet I took. Sadly, they weren't in focus enough to tell apart from a few different kinds of Murre and a Razorbill.  The Brown Thrasher is my current nemesis bird, I've made many a drive to a certain location where they're reported to be nesting, only to be eluded. My last trip I caught quick glimpses and got blurry photos enough for a positive ID but I really wanted a shot of that heavy, decurved bill. BVD, bigtime.  Today I was going to go on a birding adventure to chase after a Brown Thrasher but decided to stay home and clean up the house instead, and as I walked to my garage I heard the 'tea-kettle' calls of a Carolina Wren and was shocked to find my first sighting of the bird hanging out in my birdbath. Not a particularly rare bird, but one I haven't been lucky enough to see thusfar.  I don't recall the article mentioning this, but oh boy does it feel good to twitch a nemesis bird and come out victorious. The greater the struggle, the better it feels when you get a glimpse."

birding,3boq3q,kmoonster,1 point,Tue Jun 30 22:48:38 2015 UTC,"This is not the greatest picture, but from what I can make it it strikes me as some sort of swallow or swift. If they are a swallow the nest is either up on the side of a building, in a partially enclosed area like a barn, eaves, or under a deck. A few species also nest in bird houses/hollow cavities.  If it is a swift the nest would almost certainly be in a chimney or similar shaped/sized pipelike thing--chimney, top of a broken off tree, building air vent, or similar.  It is just old enough to fledge based on the tail and beak 'look', my guess would be the parents are likely around, but...a parking lot is no place for a baby. Any bushes in the area there where you could put it? The parents will be small, fast, and darting--something like bats except out in daylight."

But, the next day, after a heavy storm, I found him dead on my front walk. Broke my heart. Wish I had taken him in.  We took care of baby birds frequently as kids, this is back in the 50's and 60's before people knew the p's stuck around.  So, it is hard to know what is the best thing to do. Maybe call your Ag Extension - they are everywhere. They might be able to point you to an experienced tender.  Good thoughts going out to you and the little one."

I think birdfeeders in an area with a large roaming cat population can create a buffet for the cats rather than helping the birds. Cats learn quickly there will usually be a cluster of birds on the ground under a feeder, a short dash away from a flowerbed or shrubbery where the cat can lie in wait.      My cat goes outside -- on a leash. I took down my feeders because of the neighbors' cats. I had better luck with a birdbath because the birds stayed off the ground.

birding,3beatt,DanN58,2,Sun Jun 28 13:06:59 2015 UTC,Peanuts!
birding,3beatt,typosensei,3,Sun Jun 28 15:30:42 2015 UTC,"Our Jays (and our finches, cardinals, grackles, doves, chickadees, titmice—I could go on), like the Black-Oil Sunflower Seed. It attracts the maximum number of birds, and there is minimal waste."
birding,3beatt,lessthanthreesquared,4,Sun Jun 28 13:38:33 2015 UTC,"Just gunna say this. In Vermont they love that stuff. We have two feeders with just black oil, one's like yours and the Jays get in it, the other's a tubular feeder and they and the squirrels can't get in. Point is, nothing likes those little seeds (millet?) and they always get wasted, so we switched to just black oil. Now, even though a lot gets knocked on the ground, the birds just pick it up. No waste, ever."
birding,3beatt,iwantttopettthekitty,2,Sun Jun 28 14:22:55 2015 UTC,"Jays looooove peanuts. You can try feeding that. Or, try looking at a few feeders that allow only smaller birds. (Normally they're used to deter grackles, but jays are big enough.) You can try feeding safflower but I'm not sure if they eat it or not. Safflower is a good seed if you don't want blackbirds or squirrels, but due to its tough shell you'll lose your buntings, goldfinches, and bluebirds if you get them. What seed do you feed?"
birding,3beatt,Saphine_,2,Sun Jun 28 14:15:05 2015 UTC,"For now it is just a mixed seed from Lowes. Sunflower seed still in the shell, deshelled sunflower seeds, cracked corn, and a few other little seeds that I am not sure what the are, round whitish ones, round reddish ones and oblong dark brown/blackish ones. I think it is this one, but it is a smaller bag, and looks a bit slightly different so I could be wrong. I don't think any of the birds eat the red seeds, except the collared doves, because usually the basin ends up with only those, and I have to periodically clear them out (or it was that way til the jays came.) I started spreading those on the sidewalk nearby, and the doves would come and eat those."
birding,3beatt,Saphine_,2,Sun Jun 28 14:39:28 2015 UTC,"Ah, this is another reason you have a mess. Those little red round seeds sound like red millet, which is almost never eaten by birds. The cracked corn isn't a good seed to feed either. The reason they do that is because it's cheaper for them (and you) to use these filler seeds that the birds don't eat in the mix. Also, the edible seeds (in your case, sunflower seeds, sunflower chips, and white millet) tend to be a lower quality. The reason the jays dish out all the food is because most of it is stuff they won't eat!  I do work at a Wild Birds Unlimited so I am a bit biased, but our seed has no fillers and is always fresh! You can probably get some more advice at one specifically for your area, too. It doesn't have to be just a WBU- there are a few smaller bird shops that should be able to help, too!"
birding,3beatt,lessthanthreesquared,2,Sun Jun 28 14:59:31 2015 UTC,"Okay, I will look into a different feed. The only WBU near me is apperently 'permanently closed' according to Google..."
birding,3beatt,KyoFoocha,1 point,Sun Jun 28 15:08:05 2015 UTC,"I get my black oil sunflower seeds in bulk bags from Lowe's. They might not be as fresh as WBU, but it's convenient, and the birds seem to love 'em."
birding,3beatt,stfuirl,2,Mon Jun 29 17:35:40 2015 UTC,"As a fellow WBU employee I agree with this post. <3 For your situation, if you're going to buy a birdseed blend, look for mixes that are high in black oil sunflower, especially. The millet is okay too, though it's designed to be thrown on the ground for ground feeding birds when its put into blends. (Jays wont be interested in it but doves/ground feeders love it) It's the fillers like red millet, milo and oats that can make up 80% of some big box store bags that you need to be careful of. Most birds don't like em at all :)  Try peanuts in the shell for your jays. They love those things like nothing i've ever seen. It's incredible. <3 It might just give your jays a place of their own to eat and they'll leave your little feeder alone so you can focus on smaller finches and whatnot there. :)  WBU sells great seeds, but if there isnt one near you, Audubon and Natures Song are two brands that I buy in a pinch when I'm off and dont feel like going into my workplace to buy seed, haha. :D"
birding,3beatt,mallorypallory,2,Wed Jul 1 20:39:11 2015 UTC,"We have the Squirrel Buster which also keeps put big birds like blue jays. You can also get or make a seed hoop to hang under the feeder to catch the seed. We have one and it brings in a bunch of birds, like chipping sparrows, that don't like to sit at a feeder but can still bounce around in the hoop."

If you're looking for long range, the 10s might be better.  The following link leads to a Cornell Lab of Ornithology list of best binoculars and their prices. They do have a ""budget"" section. Go check it out! It was made in 2013 but they're all great nocs; two years isn't a long time when it comes to binocular advancement.  http://www.allaboutbirds.org/bbimages/lb/2013/autumn/bins/Binocular_review_full_spreadsheet.pdf"

After posting my thread I went off and did as much research as I could find on my phone and found some nice 10x42's I think he would like. I'll check out this link and see what I can find there.   Thank you!
birding,3ajavh,man_sandwich,1 point,Sat Jun 20 23:30:42 2015 UTC,I have a pair of Nikon Monarch 8x10 and they really are the best you can get for a reasonable price
birding,3ajavh,ruk_hai,2,Sun Jun 21 11:01:09 2015 UTC,I assume you mean 8x40 or 8x42 rather than 8x10...? Because 8x10s would be very dark since the eyepiece is too small.
birding,3ajavh,wanderingfalcon,2,Sun Jun 21 16:21:49 2015 UTC,"If he's watching an eagle nest from the house, maybe a starter spotting scope would be better. Higher magnification, more stable, better for nest watching."
birding,3ajavh,Alchemisthim,1 point,Sun Jun 21 07:07:30 2015 UTC,"I just did a lot of research myself, and I ended up buying the Nikon Trailblazer 8x25. I love this binocular. Compact, light, great clarity, and fairly inexpensive. Compared to x42 bins, an x25 won't let in as much light (e.g., less detail in low light), but I'm not really using them during crepuscular hours, so I don't notice much difference. When deciding between 8x and 10x, I found the 8x had better stability (i.e., less shaky) and field of view (i.e., wider viewing diameter).  My other finalists were the Pentax DCF LV 9x28 and the Nikon Monarch 5 8x42.  I chose the Trailblazer over both of these due to size and price."
birding,3ajmoh,catroaring,8,Sat Jun 20 21:04:26 2015 UTC,You should let her handle it. She and her man will make another nest or clean out this one. Doves are especially good at having more than one hatch per year. Nature can be a little unsettling sometimes. She'll be fine.

No Spectacled Owl for me yet unfortunately. I am not much of a photographer. I was in a jeep going offroad, it was night and we had the lights on.

birding,3a7ix9,ruk_hai,3,Thu Jun 18 15:02:37 2015 UTC,"We were on a boat in the Pantanal, the greatest wetland in the world. We were looking for Giant Otters, but after a long day we had only seen loads of Cayman, Capybara and loads of Herons and Kingfishers. I was a bit bummed out and so was the rest of the boat. Then all of a sudden I see something in the bank of the river. I am the only one on the boat who has binoculars, and after raising them I start shaking as soon as I see what we're dealing with. I almost yell it out at the top of my lungs, but then I realize it's probably a better idea to whisper. So I do. JAGUAR! I whisper in my lowest voice. 4 other heads collectively snap into the same direction and 4 pairs of eyes get as large as plates. The guide kills the engine and lets us gently drift downstream, past the jaguar. It is just sitting there on the bank of the river, walking around a big every now and then. The guide got its attention by making baby Capibara sounds, making the jaguar stare us right in the face. We have a stare off for around 5-10 minutes and then the Jaguar gets up and leaves, leaving us shaking with adrenaline and unbelief in our boat. I took some shitty pictures with my iPhone through my binoculars as proof."

birding,3a7ix9,V_Codwheel,1 point,Thu Jun 18 18:25:46 2015 UTC,"Jaguarundi:       The jaguarundi or eyra cat (Puma yagouaroundi), is a small, wild cat native to Central and South America. In 2002, the IUCN classified the jaguarundi as Least Concern, although they considered it likely that no conservation units beyond the megareserves of the Amazon Basin could sustain long-term viable populations. Its presence in Uruguay is uncertain.   In some Spanish-speaking countries, the jaguarundi is also called gato colorado, gato moro, león brenero, onza, tigrillo, and leoncillo.  The Brazilian Portuguese pronunciation of its common English and Portuguese name is IPA: [ʒɐɡwɐɾũˈdʒi]. It is also called gato-mourisco, eirá, gato-preto, and maracajá-preto in Portuguese.

Eg. I upload my list and set the scope to north america, and it would spit out a few regions (or even a heatmap combined with the roadtrip tool) of where the most ""lifer dense"" areas would be. No idea how easy this would be to implement, or if it's even possible with what ebird provides, but it would be a cool way to optimize trips dedicated to filling out your list."

birding,39nijr,squirrelsonfilm,2,Sat Jun 13 02:50:07 2015 UTC,"See, his books are excellent if you're a beginner. As you get better, look into getting the East/West Sibley guides. They're handier and hold a lot more info."

I'm a bookworm so when I made my transition from one of Stan's books to a full-blown Peterson's guide (another great guide, but I got the full N. American edition) I absorbed it like a sponge. I now recommend a regional Sibley's due to how light they are (not carrying a textbook with you everywhere),  the illustrations, and how easy it is to use. You might get a bit confused at first since the birds are arranged taxonomically and not by color. If you feel that you can get the hang of the book after a few looks, I'd recommend getting it!"

Either my phone if I'm going to be somewhere with a signal or a field guide, usually Sibley's it's what I was taught with.  IBird is hugely inconvenient in places with no signal as it tries to connect to the net on start up.  At least this was the case last time I was somewhere where this mattered.  I've never been much of a notepad person, I memorize what I see and where while I'm out there.  I've never been a good enough Lister/birder to get to the point that I can't remember everything I saw.  If I'm looking at exact numbers for Christmas bird counts and the like I will definitely bring a pad.    Typically I also bring a Cliff bar or something else along those lines and water.  My supplies also really depends on how I'm birding.  If I'm doing a ten mile hike while birding I'm going to be bringing a long a whole different pack than I would if I was wandering down main street.  edit: personally I find book field guides way easier to use than digital field guides in general, but once I started photographing birds it was just too much to carry.  Now I tend to bird and do photography separately though so I can enjoy both, so I use the field guide way more."

This means it is in between the stage of leaving the nest and learning to fly. The parents are most likely still caring for it, so you did a good thing leaving it be. That being said; even if I found an injured bird I would still leave it die peacefully. It's just a part of life in my opinion and its corpse would make a nice meal for other animals. Circle of life and all."
birding,39ndhg,ruk_hai,4,Sat Jun 13 00:20:49 2015 UTC,"Last week I found a short eared owl fledgeling with a broken wing. Usually I'm all the circle of life and stuff but I just couldn't help it and took him home to give him some water. They are pretty rare in germany, so I thought if there is remotely a chance to help him I should at least give it a try. Besides, where should one draw the line? If I would find you in the desert with a broken leg, I wouldn't say 'Welp, that's the circle of life, your corpse will be a nice meal for the vultures, bye' Why should we value one life more than another?   Well the end of the story was, I brought it to a vet, but the wing was too damaged and had a bad infection, so we had to put him down. But at least it hadn't have to die miserably in the cold alone eaten alive by the crows.  Goodbye little friend."

birding,394u6g,Eitth,2,Tue Jun 9 07:10:22 2015 UTC,"Birds don't normally pick up or carry their offspring while flying (though Loons and other waterbirds may carry young on their backs in the water!). Most songbirds aren't strong enough to lift their young, much less carry them.   However, as soon as young birds leave the nest (""fledge"") they are capable of hopping and fluttering short distances. IF your baby bird was a fledgling, he was probably still being cared for by his parents, who were regularly visiting him with food.   So no, his parents couldn't ""pick him up"" but they could certainly encourage him to flutter to a different bush or area of your yard as soon as he was strong enough."

So apparently cranes prey heavily on red-wing blackbird nests. As a result the blackbirds have developed a natural and healthy hatred of the cranes and will attack them, and drive them off, at every opportunity.

The other one is a mix of wild mallard and the domestic duck. Most domestic ducks are descended from mallards, which is why they can hybridize, and many birders consider mallard/domestic crosses to be ""barnyard"" or ""bastard"" rather than true hybrids. The domestics are usually bigger than wild ducks, as they have been bred for size (to be food for humans)."

When the chicks leave the nest they won't be able to fly very well yet, so they might not be able to get out of the window as easily as their parents! Keep an eye on the room, and if you find any fledglings on the floor put them outside under the window where the parents can find them. Hope this helps!"

Good thoughts on the food though! We use soaked cat chow at the rehab center I work at for some bird species."

This is what we gave baby birds when I volunteered at a wildlife rehab center. They are very needy and do best with dedicated caretakers at rehab centers. It was not a fun job.   Edit: you have to use blunt tweezers to carefully place the food far enough down their throats. If you place it too shallow, they can asyphxiate. they also need to be warm and not blasted with 65 degree  AC   Edit 2: if you can, keep it outside in a spot where it can get shade/shelter and be out of the reach of predators. The parents were probably taking care of it from the ground when you took it."

Wind isn't exactly a GOP darling, and wind developers are typically only constrained by the USFWS for bald and golden eagle events and other typical T&E issues. MBTA isn't really factored into development plans unless a site poses a T&E risk that happens to be a migratory bird.  Upstream oil and gas and the coal industries, however, often build open containment or tailings/ash ponds that are toxic enough to kill flocks of migratory birds that land in them. I'm curious to know who sponsored this as well."
birding,38phym,birdiesss,1 point,Sat Jun 6 12:09:59 2015 UTC,"I'm sure the oil and coal have something to do with it, too, but just because wind isn't a GOP darling doesn't mean that it isn't a big enough commodity to have lobbyists. It's all about energy giants when we should just be building solar panels on all of our roofs, no harming any wildlife or currently untouched land. :("
birding,38phym,SlideRuleLogic,-2,Sat Jun 6 19:29:38 2015 UTC,"Wind blows mostly at night throughout the U.S. - we need wind to complement solar for the next two decades while storage comes up to speed (and because the Midwest has so much wind that it's practically a crime not to generate with it).  Also, distributed solar isn't going to drive either tech improvements in solar or conversion to solar. ~80% of added solar capacity in the U.S. is at utility scale."

It's far better for the environment than gas generation, which is the source with which wind primarily competes. I've never understood why so many environmentalists see wind as a threat to solar - they are complementary because of the diurnal time patterns I mentioned in my last.   Any time I hear arguments like yours, all I think is ""Another environmental idealist who is sacrificing the forest for the trees."" There's no excuse for birders to be so anti-wind. Wind power is infinitely better for birds than coal and gas generation, and only marginally worse for birds than solar."

birding,382wqx,Carpocadus,1 point,Mon Jun 1 14:03:54 2015 UTC,"Yes, may bad...meant Eastern Towhee. What I saw...overall buff, darker on top, streaks on upper and sides of breast, sorta big and broad yellowish bill, overall larger than a sparrow but smaller than juvenile Towhees, with a longish tail with white outer feathers that run the full length of the tail. It was sticking close to or under a low rhododendron bush foraging in the leaf litter and mulch. Behavior was much like the Towhees...erratic movements, bobbing/twitching tail action in that Towhee way in which the tail feathers are very briefly flared wide, showing off those long white outer tail features. I will certainly check out the juveniles you suggested. The way in which the bill seemed large and broad caused me to instinct towards a bird between fledgling and juvenile. eBird shows a sighting about 20 miles away, but includes no data attached, like a date."
birding,382wqx,Carpocadus,2,Mon Jun 1 14:27:14 2015 UTC,"Sounds like a juvenile towhee to me. They'll change in appearance a lot as they grow, try google images and see if there's any similar photos."
birding,382wqx,Carpocadus,1 point,Mon Jun 1 14:44:13 2015 UTC,"Okay, you're convincing me.  The typical juvie Towhee I recognize here still has a hood (although brown, not black), and usually sports a brown patch on the side breast/flank (although duller brown, not the adult's bright brown-orange...both of which this mystery bird was lacking.  But a late fledgling, before typical juvie appearance could easily fit example and example-bottom of page, and here-bottom of page as those distinctions don't seem to have developed at fledgling's point of development.  Plus, the presence of breast streaking fits, as does that too-big-for-its-head broad yellowish bill that fledgling tend to have before they take on that older juvie/adult darker, more conical bill.  And the typical towhee behavior and preferred habitat jives, too.  Thanks a ton...now I can go on about my day."

birding,37w2oh,p4rus,3,Sun May 31 19:03:39 2015 UTC,"Back in the 90's, before I got into birding, my job sent me to Naples, and I took the chance to do some touristing at Herculaneum.  It was pretty cool.  Afterwards I was sitting up on an overlook of the site, and off to one side I noticed a hummingbird on some flowers, which was really cool.  Then later I learned that Europe doesn't have any hummingbirds.  So I have no idea what I saw."
birding,37w2oh,SquidgyTheWhale,6,Sun May 31 05:03:57 2015 UTC,It would have been a Hummingbird Hawk Moth.  And we thought the Naples/Sorrento area was disappointing bird wise when we went in 2012... but did enjoy the rock thrushes at Herculaneum.
birding,37w2oh,Saphine_,2,Sun May 31 09:13:13 2015 UTC,Fantastic.  This was a mystery I'd carried around for 20 years.  I love insects as well so this revelation is interesting that way too.  Thanks random internet person!  (Here's a sample video of the moth for those interested.)
birding,37w2oh,Saphine_,3,Sun May 31 09:26:59 2015 UTC,"That's interesting! I remember the first time I learned there were no hummingbirds outside the Americas I was kind of shocked. Rufous hummers fly so many miles during migration, though, I'd expect at least some species to show up further outside."
birding,37w2oh,Gladiator96,2,Sun May 31 07:38:15 2015 UTC,"HI!! Oh man, I never thought I would see a fellow birder in Italy... I'm going for 5 weeks this summer, it's my third time. Where in Italy will you be? I'm more experienced with the northern areas than the south."
birding,37w2oh,pilotw09,1 point,Sun May 31 00:15:14 2015 UTC,"Hi! I'm going to Florence and Rome (with my choir). It's not for birding, but I figured I'd take the chance to get some lifers."
birding,37w2oh,TextofReason,2,Sun May 31 01:30:21 2015 UTC,"If you can, try to get to the Po Delta. You can see thousands of Greater Flamingos, along with Northern Lapwings, Black-winged Stilts, Squacco Herons, gulls (like Mediterranean, Slender-billed) and a lot more! Spotted Flycatchers are pretty numerous, as are Yellow-legged Gulls, Black-headed Gulls, Italian Sparrows (they aren't House Sparrows!) Blackbirds, coots, and moorhen. Some warblers you might get are Sardinian, Subalpine, and Blackcap. Of course, you're going at a much better time than me (I'm going in late summer) so you should see a lot! One thing I really noticed was the lack of raptors- in Italy I've only seen Common Kestrel, Common Buzzard, and European Honey-buzzard. Oh yes, and don't forget about Chaffinches!"
birding,37w2oh,cuginhamer,2,Sun May 31 10:22:13 2015 UTC,"Thank you so much! I will definitely see how close I am. If I'm not able, I guess I'll just have to make another Italy trip for birds..."
birding,37v1yo,budgiebum,12,Sat May 30 17:12:53 2015 UTC,"Saying hummingbirds are territorial is sort of like saying that they're small and hyperactive.   It could not be more true.      Generally if you put out a feeder, you'll probably get a hummingbird who develops a proprietary interest in that feeder and tries to chase all other hummingbirds away (with a possible exception, briefly, for any offspring).    This leads to quite possible the cutest dogfights ever as the hummingbirds zip around the yard chasing off interlopers."
birding,37v1yo,DanN58,5,Sat May 30 17:47:10 2015 UTC,"Forgot to mention -- one tends to think of hummingbirds as being in constant motion, flitting from flower to flower and never stopping.   But males, particularly, will frequent just roost in a nearby tree and guard their ""nectar"" source.     So if you look carefully, you may be able to spy your hummingbird's favored perch."
birding,37v1yo,DanN58,2,Sat May 30 17:49:50 2015 UTC,I've seen this one do that. He flies to the nearest tree in the woods and will sit there for a bit and come back. how stinking cute!
birding,37v1yo,ruk_hai,3,Sat May 30 18:10:45 2015 UTC,I'm assuming not all species are territorial? I have seen feeders with many different hummingbirds feeding peacefully together.
birding,37v1yo,FineAsABeesWing,3,Sat May 30 19:50:46 2015 UTC,"I've wondered about this too. If you go to a place like Patagonia, AZ you see 100s of hummers at the dozens of feeders. I think once the density of birds reaches a certain point they just give up and eat."
birding,37v1yo,steve626,5,Sat May 30 21:19:40 2015 UTC,"I lived in New Mexico and have seen a hundred or so HBs at a series of feeders.  They still bother one another and chase other ones off, despite there being plenty of spots to feed.  Here's a shot that shows 2 Rufous HBs, on the left, harressing one another despite there being plenty places to feed."
birding,37v1yo,kmoonster,3,Sat May 30 22:16:51 2015 UTC,"I've noticed this, and wondered if they differentiate between a spot to eat while migrating and a 'home base' when they get to where ever they are headed."
birding,37v1yo,FineAsABeesWing,1 point,Sat May 30 23:23:28 2015 UTC,That would make sense. They would be most territorial when they're nesting. But they have clearly evolved into 'much nastier than they need to be' most of the time.
birding,37v1yo,kmoonster,1 point,Sat May 30 23:36:25 2015 UTC,Of this there is little question! Couldn't agree more.
birding,37v1yo,ruk_hai,2,Sat May 30 23:45:24 2015 UTC,"Yep, same here in Colombia at places like this one"
birding,37v1yo,TheGeekyHummingbird,2,Sat May 30 23:10:26 2015 UTC,I hand no idea. It really is amusing to watch! I just never thought they would try and Chase others off. Most pictures and videos I see of feeders features a few birds at once. Maybe that have multiple feeders. That what i want to end up with. A few feeders and friendly plants for them. Thanks for the info! The fights are adorable.
birding,37v1yo,TheGeekyHummingbird,4,Sat May 30 18:00:35 2015 UTC,Very. Hummingbirds have been known to fight each other for feeder spots even though there is plenty of nectar to go around.
birding,37v1yo,zugunruh3,1 point,Sat May 30 17:52:35 2015 UTC,"How amusing, thanks for the info!"
birding,37v1yo,ssdivot,3,Sat May 30 17:58:41 2015 UTC,"It can be very cute. But if you see this often, and done by the same hummingbird it can be problematic to your feeder environment and to the other local hummingbirds. At that point you have several options: Let nature do its thing and leave it alone (easiest solution), Set up another feeder some distance away, or look into resources on how to alleviate the avian dispute in your yard (this can be difficult)."
birding,37v1yo,steve626,2,Sat May 30 19:20:27 2015 UTC,I will do option 1 and 2. I'm not going to funk with the birds and I already wanted multiple feeders :) thank you the info
birding,37v1yo,Kiwibirdee,3,Sat May 30 19:28:33 2015 UTC,"For the best results set up the second feeder out of sight of the first if you can, that way he can't just sit and chase birds away from both feeders."

birding,37u7ox,autowikibot,1 point,Sat May 30 13:08:51 2015 UTC,"White stork:       The white stork (Ciconia ciconia) is a large bird in the stork family Ciconiidae. Its plumage is mainly white, with black on its wings. Adults have long red legs and long pointed red beaks, and measure on average 100–115 cm (39–45 in) from beak tip to end of tail, with a 155–215 cm (61–85 in) wingspan. The two subspecies, which differ slightly in size, breed in Europe (north to Finland), northwestern Africa, southwestern Asia (east to southern Kazakhstan) and southern Africa. The white stork is a long-distance migrant, wintering in Africa from tropical Sub-Saharan Africa to as far south as South Africa, or on the Indian subcontinent. When migrating between Europe and Africa, it avoids crossing the Mediterranean Sea and detours via the Levant in the east or the Strait of Gibraltar in the west, because the air thermals on which it depends do not form over water.

birding,37po5l,sirshartsalot,3,Fri May 29 12:29:23 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately, not a lot of critters actually eat bees. Their stings and bright warning colors are a pretty effective deterrent!    Also, as you discovered, in northern North America there aren't that many bee-eating birds. I'd recommend encouraging things like swallows; they are aerial insectivores and sometimes take bees and wasps. However, I'd even more thoroughly recommend dragonflies and bats! Both are vicious predators of insects. Dragonflies will eat bees, small wasps, and mosquitoes, and bats will eat mosquitoes.    The best way to attract dragonflies is to have a pond, but that's a pretty tall order! Short of a pond, I'd recommend putting up a bat house, swallow boxes (if there are Purple Martins in your area, a martin house would be ideal), and a water source. A wide, shallow bird bath - especially one with a drip system to keep the water's surface slightly rippled - is the best. If you don't want the hassle of a drip system, just make sure to change the water frequently.    Absolutely try to attract woodpeckers too, but in my experience they aren't terribly effective at wasp control (source: had lots of woodpeckers and lots of wasps at the same time). That's just anecdata though; your experience may be different! Woodpeckers like black oil sunflower seeds in the warm months and suet in the cold months (cold enough to keep the suet from getting oily). You can buy fancy seed/fruit-filled suet blocks, but you could also just go to your local grocery store butcher counter and ask for beef suet (tell them it's to keep your pot roast from drying out; sometimes they'll give it to you for free). Stuff the suet strips in a wire suet basket and you're good!"
birding,37po5l,Nantosuelta,2,Fri May 29 14:51:29 2015 UTC,"Do you have bees, or wasps? Bees are literally harmless and won't hurt you, but some wasps will. You can google to ID what species you have to see if they are any threat at all. Simple honey bees are a good thing to have around!  Another possible solution if you do have wasps: You can buy praying mantis egg sacs from your local nursery or online, and release them in your backyard - they will eat pretty much every single other bug out there."

If you save a baby bird from the snake, you are simply saving it for the worms.  You said the baby birds flew away?  Their ability to fly means they have a significantly higher chance of survival.  I know I am being cynical, but if they could fly their odds are probably as good as any other animal.  After all their mother could fly and it didn't save her.

birding,37cca3,whaddup_pup,1 point,Wed May 27 01:18:19 2015 UTC,Ukraine (western part) Camera is 6D. (Full frame) I was extremely close and the light was quite good... Sunny with a small bit of the clouds.  In case of using cropped sensor you are forcing only part of your glass to provide a picture for almost the same amount of megapixels. So in general you would need to have a clear sunny day to have that picture made with almost the same parameters. Also there are glass that are specially made for cropped sensors.   One word. One would never outsmart the laws of physics. Making the better/sharper picture would require you to have a bigger sensor and better glass (like Canon EF 500mm L f4 II) that is around 10k USD...  Crop in general is darker/softer on the EF glass due to the way EF lenses are made. You could get a sharp pictures with normal light. But it would be exlusion of rule unfortunately.  Also note ISO 100 was providing a lot of noise for me on this lens.  I know this because of using 650D with this lens. I did sold it now because 90% of photos made by crop were unsuitable by my quality meter. However I'm only close to cleaning out my RAW files from those days....  Anyway. My suggestion is to move to FUll Frame sensor. Or at least new 7D mk II...

birding,376i5e,Br0shaan,1 point,Mon May 25 07:41:14 2015 UTC,"Birdsong is mainly a territorial display. Birds use it as a sort of ""Here I am! This space is mine!"" kind of signal. So if bird A were to fly into bird B's territory and start singing, it would be like getting up in his face and going ""Yeah, so what? I'm gonna sing wherever I want! Whaddaya gonna do about it?"" So bird B is going to immediately try to find bird A and chase him out of the territory.  Chances are, your whistles sound a bit like magpies and they're swooping in to check out a potential intruder. Hope this helps!"
birding,376i5e,Kaeleira,2,Mon May 25 12:55:19 2015 UTC,"There is also pishing.  Making the sounds that birds make in distress/when confronting a predator.

birding,376i5e,ruk_hai,1 point,Mon May 25 22:26:43 2015 UTC,"I think it's a combination of you attracting its attention with the whistling and it being the breeding season so the birds are more territorial than normally, but that's all just speculation on my part."
birding,376i5e,Jaemad,2,Mon May 25 22:30:04 2015 UTC,"Well, so far they just keep around for a minute or two and then look around the area for another few minutes and just leave.  Maybe I shouldn't mess with them too much either way."

birding,3756sw,asoiaf_fan,3,Sun May 24 23:50:25 2015 UTC,"I bet you anything it's a fledgling, and not really injured. Fledglings usually spend at least a few days after leaving the nest awkwardly hanging out on the ground before they actually learn how to fly. Does it look like a cranky old man, with a frowny-looking beak and fuzz around its head? Here's a chart that shows baby birds at different stages of development. Hope this helps!"
birding,3756sw,Kaeleira,1 point,Mon May 25 01:05:42 2015 UTC,"Could you give some information on what the bird looks like? That could give us some clues as to what kind of bird it is and what it eats.   If you have it in a safe warm place, you're doing a lot already. :) Perhaps provide a little shallow dish of water for it to drink out of if it would like, and maybe keep it somewhere it can see the sun and hear other birds outside. If you can tell me what it looks like I can tell you what it eats, but otherwise-- if there's nothing seriously wrong with it internally we don't know about-- it should be fine until Tuesday!"
birding,3756sw,bagelsandcoffee,2,Mon May 25 00:21:17 2015 UTC,It is greyish black with a cream breast that has black spots on it. It's wings feathers are mostly solid grey with cream tips except for maybe the top inch behind it's neck is cream with grey/black spots.

birding,3756sw,birdiesss,1 point,Mon May 25 01:36:16 2015 UTC,It's night time now. Should I put it back now or wait until morning? I have it outside in my car port in the makeshift nest from the picture I linked. I do have things barricading it from the stray cats that roam my neighborhood at the moment. When I did move it to begin with I had watched it for at least 30 minutes but initially I had to chase a cat away from it.
birding,3756sw,bagelsandcoffee,1 point,Mon May 25 01:44:02 2015 UTC,"It might be okay until the morning. In fact, if it's outside on your deck the parents might even find it yet.

birding,374bbj,TheFerricGenum,4,Sun May 24 19:21:35 2015 UTC,I have no experience with that particular pair. I can say an 8x42 will not be as compact as an 8x32 which might be nicer for bicycling. I'm personally a huge fan of Vortex and Eagle Optics. They make good products that are warrantied extremely well. Worth a look at in my opinion.
birding,374bbj,WiOutdoorsman,3,Sun May 24 19:58:09 2015 UTC,"Best bang for your buck: Nikon Monarch 3 8x 42 mm (if you can find them) but they're not that compact. They are really nice though. If your budget allows it, Leica Compact Ultravid 8x20 are tiny miracles, amazingly sharp, but glamorously priced."
birding,374bbj,AgaveNeomexicana,3,Sun May 24 20:39:07 2015 UTC,"I have the Nikon Monarchs and love them. My buddy (he is a dentist and doing well financially) has a pair of Swarovski nocs that cost around $2800 I think. We bird together frequently and while his are amazing and just super clear, I dont think the difference is 10x the Monarchs (mine were like $250). I agree with Monarchs. Great for the price."
birding,374bbj,thewitt33,2,Sun May 24 21:33:18 2015 UTC,"The nice thing about alpha binoculars (strangely, since they cost so much) is that you don't have to worry about them. If anything goes wrong, their manufacturers will make them right. In some cases, they will even replace them if they are lost or stolen. Plus, they are really nice to look through. But paying for them is no joke."

birding,374bbj,thewitt33,1 point,Tue May 26 20:26:11 2015 UTC,Check out this review . I would suggest the Nikon Monarch 5 8x42 for him. Just my opinion though.
birding,374bbj,epare22,1 point,Tue May 26 21:05:06 2015 UTC,"If he's going on his bike, I would recommend monoculars. They're much lighter and easier to carry around. I've switched to monocs for birding, one handed operation, most of the outdoor ones are waterproof and somewhat shockproof. They're a big improvement from one I had years ago."
birding,374bbj,feelingproductive,1 point,Sun May 24 20:59:49 2015 UTC,"I personally have a pair of Zen Ray ed3 8x43 binoculars that I got at a great deal because they were a display pair and they are wonderful. The brand is not as well known as Nikon, Vortex or Pentax, but they are legit and in my opinion, the glass performs nearly as well as binocs that retail for twice the price.  They cost a bit more than the ones you are looking at, but if you spot a deal, you should consider them."

I've used them and liked them.  I've also found the more expensive binoculars to be worth the extra money."

birding,374bbj,randyelmer,1 point,Wed May 27 03:24:05 2015 UTC,"I don't know, I'd suggest some searching (I found this - http://www.birdforum.net/showthread.php?t=157316 ) to try and answer these questions.  My experience has been that the difference between a $200-300 and a $500-600 is very noticeable and that the difference from there to a $1000 pair is also very noticeable.  Best advice is to try them - find a local store with a good selection if you can.  I've seen some amazon reviews which indicate they ordered 15 and returned all but one - as another option."
birding,374xat,birdiesss,2,Sun May 24 22:26:08 2015 UTC,"I gotta say this is really weird. Male cowbirds don't do ANY parental care, so it's actually really odd that they would be responding to begging in this way. It would be weird for a cowbird of either sex to be feeding a juvenile."

birding,374io6,m4gpi,1 point,Sun May 24 22:57:26 2015 UTC,I kinda hope they do nest in my planter (and I hope your pair nests in yours!!). The only thing I'm worried about is a nest of starlings in the downstairs neighbors deck rafters...
birding,374io6,m4gpi,2,Sun May 24 23:14:27 2015 UTC,"Right on time! Last year I had two consecutive house finch nests, starting around this time.   As the others said, be cautious about watering; you may just have to sacrifice the plants for a few weeks. They are quite skittish, so do your best to avoid the pot as much as you can. If it's near a door, you may want to try to move it away to give them some space (before the nest is done, that is).   Also, if you can hear the nest from the house, you'll get to know their songs very well. The mother has an ""I'm laying an egg!"" song, kind of a long, loud ramble with a lot of chirping at the end (because, of course), and when she approaches the nest, you'll hear her make some repeated ""pee-eep? Pee-eep? Pee-eep?"" sounds. The male may do this as well, I'm not sure, but the female for sure."
birding,374io6,fb97e4ad,1 point,Mon May 25 03:44:50 2015 UTC,"Should I start putting seeds out for them? I know this would attract other birds, so it's probably not a good idea...."
birding,375aj4,SlasherMassacre,2,Mon May 25 00:24:51 2015 UTC,"Is your timeline pretty solid? Northern mockingbirds usually fledge (jump out of the nest and live for a week or two on the ground so they have room to grow their flight feathers) at about 10-12 days old. It's very possible (and most likely without any other sign of gore) that the fledglings are hiding in the bushes nearby and the mother who was watching you knows where they are and is feeding them.   If they were only 7-8 days old or so, it's still possible they ended up on the ground - no trace of them though means that something maybe did get them. A cat or a crow or a blue jay is a likely suspect. But no need to give up hope, keep an eye out for them, you may see them yet!"
birding,375aj4,birdiesss,1 point,Mon May 25 00:40:29 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'd put them at around the 7-8 days old mark. I didn't know that about Northern mockingbirds, isn't them going on the ground very dangerous?   It's pretty dark now, tomorrow I'll look more thoroughly. If they were eaten, I'd say it has to be a bird that took them. If it were a cat or snake the nest would have to be disturbed and I'd imagine there would be some sign of struggle.   I really hope their okay ):"
birding,375aj4,birdiesss,3,Mon May 25 00:48:24 2015 UTC,"It is dangerous to be a baby bird. Almost all nesting birds go through this stage. They are unable to fully develop their feathers in their tiny nest so they have to be on the ground for a couple weeks while they grow more and learn to fly. Unfortunately, this is where many birds' lives end (outdoor cats are the big one here). It's very sad indeed but the bright side is that maybe their death helped another birds' babies to survive?   The other good news is that it's still early in the year and if the parents have lost their babies, they might try again to raise another clutch. Good luck, and I hope you find them in the morning."
birding,375aj4,birdiesss,1 point,Mon May 25 01:04:02 2015 UTC,"I got a good update! This morning we noticed that the mother was nowhere to be scene in our backyard, so we pretty much assumed she moved on now that her babies were dead. Later I went to check the mail and there was loud chirping and I noticed the mother in the front of our house near a bush(Her nest was in our backyard). Sure it could've been any other Northern Mockingbird, but I decided to investigate.   In the bush she was nearby was one of the baby chicks! It was alive... But I don't know how it got from a bush in our backyard, to a bush in our front yard. My mom told me that the mother obviously carried it, but I googled and most mother birds can't carry their young. We started to look for the second baby bird, but he was nowhere to be seen. A few hours later we tried checking on the baby bird again, and it wasn't in that bush anymore. The mother is still near though. Maybe the mother is teaching them to fly already?(They would be at the 9-10 day mark... Though I still think that's a bit too early to be able to singlehandedly perch itself on a bush.   What are the chances for the other one to be okay?"
birding,375aj4,UptownFunkLyrics,1 point,Mon May 25 19:43:01 2015 UTC,"Pretty likely, yay!! They can still hop around and mosey pretty good, and are great at hiding with their first flight feathers' camouflage. In fact, since you found the one, I'd avoid looking too hard for the other (definitely keep an eye out though!) - while mom can't physically pick them up and move them, she CAN move them away by leading them while they hop on the ground. If you are poking around TOO much she might move them out of your looking range. The last thing she wants is ANYONE to know where they are.   They are going to definitely hang around though. Do you have feeders in your yard? If not and you want to keep watching them as they fledge, you should put up some feeders so they learn your location is a prime food source. They you can watch the babies grow up until this fall (if they migrate). Good luck and thanks for the update!!!"

birding,375aj4,Kaeleira,2,Mon May 25 00:48:45 2015 UTC,"This may be hard to hear, but it's possible that a predator found the nest through your frequent checks. Squirrels and raccoons could follow your scent trail to the bush, and jays or crows could have seen you looking into the bush. For this reason it's best to leave birds' nests alone as much as possible. I really do hope that these guys are okay though, just something to think about in the future!"
birding,374w7f,sucnirvka,6,Sun May 24 22:17:30 2015 UTC,"Stay away from them, they're trained to stay still when predators and humans who try to wake them up with music are around."

I got up to close the window and the sound was still clearly heard, I just had no idea where it was coming from. So I checked the other room and there it was, cleaning its feathers like a smug little bastard, just standing there looking at me. Well sadly I couldn't just leave it there in the room to poop on stuff and keep me awake, so I moved it to the balcony. It couldn't fly higher than 20 cm and it just looked confused, also no idea how it got into the room since the window was only tilted on the top, slightly open. It's clearly still a youngling, since it has fuzzy feathers all over, and it didn't fly at all, just hopped awkwardly and tried to flap to no avail. I left him some breadcrumbs with seeds (only thing I had) on the balcony and hopefully its parents will come to its rescue."

Also now the house has rusted to the mount its screwed on to. I use shaved wood you buy at pet stores to fill the nest box up so the flickers have something to excavate. The first year about mid-summer a wren nested in the box. This year we got a pair of flickers and they spent weeks excavating and spending time every day in the nest box but they just suddenly disappeared. This coincided with some feisty encounters with Starlings. I'm not sure what happened. If you only want flickers nesting and have either wrens or starlings around I'd look into using a wren guard. I also have a squirrel baffle on the pole.
