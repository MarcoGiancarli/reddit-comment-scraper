amiiboSwap,3e36np,Lennypoco,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:36:11 2015 UTC,"Don't know, amiibo aren't really worth more than MSRP even at first print. Any value given higher than that is merely a scam artist trying to make profit off of currently low supply. They've only been out a bit less than a year, so first editions and full collections don't really mean anything until, like most collectibles, time passes and a true value is shown. I'm not really a major collector of things like these, so I'm not completely sure if what I'm saying really holds weight. You may want to pose or search this question to somewhere else in order to get a better answer, as I'm kind of talking out of my ass. Again, sorry for the long response."

amiiboSwap,3ds27p,Radiodisease1900,2,Sat Jul 18 22:34:27 2015 UTC,"Sorry, just giving some advice here. This is honestly a pretty good trade in your favor in terms of trade value, Marth goes from 50 - 70 on a first print run, while Captain Falcon goes for around ~30 - 35. Asking for two of your wants is sort of uneven for anything besides like Dedede and a common, maybe. Everything else is basically around the same if not more in terms of trade value (I think Robin/Lucina are up to your discretion, but I value them a bit more than CF, Shulk is worth around the same, and Dedede/Marth are worth ~$5 - 10 less.) Anyways, collection wise for you, this might not be the best offer, but first print Marth will just keep on rising in terms of value, and if you hold on to it, it can be worth a lot of amiibo. Sorry for giving my two cents, though I just sorta wanted to help you, it might seem like a bit of a rant..."

Please send King DeDeDe first, and once I receive confirmation that you sent it after a day, I will send you Rosaluma in return. If you still want to go through the trade after reading this please send me a PM  with pictures of the amiibo's condition, and we will discuss shipping addresses and etc. Also another condition is that we exchange shipping updates at a time most convenient for both of us, if this condition is unfulfilled I will immediately cancel the shipping the next day.  If you feel that this is unreasonable I understand, and the lack of a message will tell me that you are not interested in the trade."

amiiboSwap,3dldc8,Bossman1136,1 point,Fri Jul 17 13:50:59 2015 UTC,Thank you for your reply but I'm gonna pass on this trade proposal. I know Villager is unicorn but I feel it's a bit too much for a reprint. Splat Pack even at MSRP is equivalent to the price of 2 1/2 normal amiibos at MSRP.
amiiboSwap,3dldc8,Bossman1136,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:26:10 2015 UTC,No prob!  Is there anything else you're looking for to even things out?
amiiboSwap,3dldc8,Bossman1136,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:30:14 2015 UTC,Hmmm what would you be willing to throw in? And are you in NYC?

amiiboSwap,3dldc8,Grimlock316,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:04:35 2015 UTC,I would consider the villager re print and possibly Lucina for the splat pack and captain falcon providing that they both are NA and new in box. Can you PM me the pics please. Once I receive your pics I will send you pics of the splat pack and falcon when I get home tonite.   I see that you have a lot of trades but I  am just a bit apprehensive about trading through the mail. I'm sure you understand.

amiiboSwap,3djpss,DontReadMyNameSwine,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:36:56 2015 UTC,"I have to ask you something before we conduct the trade: Would you feel comfortable with shipping Wii Fit Trainer to me before I ship Ness to you? I always feel more comfortable being the one to get their item first when it comes to conducting trades over the Internet. Also, I would want to Skype so we can both see the other has the figure NiB and isn't trying to scam--that way we could both feel a little safer.   EDIT: I forgot to mention that this Ness is the newest print. I went to get my first amiibo at GameStop two days ago and saw they also had Ness, so I picked him up. I'm not sure if this will change whether you want him or not, but I had to make sure you knew. I've also edited the thread for other people, in case this changes your mind. I apologize for not being clear in my first post."

amiiboSwap,3dgsic,Lennypoco,1 point,Thu Jul 16 04:44:23 2015 UTC,"No problem! I've seen Little Mac go for much less these days, between $35-50. Printing doesn't really come into play for me unless that amiibo hasn't seen a reprint at all. I'm not really concerned with dollar amounts. My attitude is, ""Can I find it in a store? Did that store have a lot on the shelf recently? Can I order it at MSRP online?"" I've always based my trades on that.  I appreciate the courteousness of your responses."

amiiboSwap,3d1apt,Bronypon3,1 point,Sun Jul 12 20:35:50 2015 UTC,"Imgur so here i only showed this because this is the biggest flaw in of the box is that its slightly curved probably from hanging on the shelf, but I dont think its a huge deal not even to the NIB collectors. Its very minor i can get better pics of it if you like. Imgur Picture of the eyes so you can see that they are going generally in the same direction and not derped out. Imgur and thats the whole box. If you need any pictures further from this let me know. Yours looks plenty fine to me. All i care about is that i get a WFT and that the backing is in realitivly good shape so i can put it behind the amiibo someday."

amiiboSwap,3d0u11,SirShades,2,Sun Jul 12 20:12:53 2015 UTC,Just letting you know that when it comes to the people you want you would either need to do 3:1 or actually get some rares yourself. Also don't ask people to ship first because that's the first sign of a scammer. Follow the recommended trade list and get some rarer amiibo and you'll get some trades. Make a post like this and you'll just get down votes
