DumpsterDiving,3dyki8,pnoque,17,Mon Jul 20 16:13:09 2015 UTC,I've worked with food my whole life. Restaurants and retail grocery. It is so hard watch the trash cans overflow with food waste.    I've seen some employees where I work sneak fruit out of the trash cans and hide in place where the cameras can't see them and eat it. If a manager ever caught them they would be terminated on the spot.  I had a coworker recently get fired because she got caught putting candy bars in her pockets that she found in the trash can. She was going to give them to her kids.   She was escorted out of the store by the police and charged with theft. It makes me angry.
DumpsterDiving,3dyki8,Kokana,5,Mon Jul 20 21:43:10 2015 UTC,"What makes it hardest for me is the seeming utter lack of concern for the food waste by most of the employees. The place I work at tosses out several pizzas worth of slices t the end of the night. Never a thought toward donating to a free kitchen.   I'm going to ask about implementing a program. I'm worried about the reaction. Until then, I've been salvaging what I can before it gets tossed and putting it in boxes and bags, and placing it in a relatively clean place near or atop the dumpster. I'm fairly sure the local homeless know it's being put out for them. It's the least I could do and I need to do more."
DumpsterDiving,3dyki8,YarnYarn,4,Mon Jul 20 22:42:05 2015 UTC,"I actually used to get extra large trash bags full of Einstein Bros bagels from the trash and donate them to the food bank that I also frequented.  I always had a feeling that someone left them there to be taken. Both because the bags contained only bagels and no other trash as well as the fact that others sometimes beat me to the bags.  The food bank I dropped them off at specifically told me that they don't care where the food came from. That's just how hard up they were/are?  I live in the country now and there are no dumpsters here, but man, if I miss any part of city living, it is the diving.  Also, fuck those people that lock their dumpsters or pour bleach on good food."
DumpsterDiving,3dyki8,isaidputontheglasses,2,Tue Jul 21 03:08:40 2015 UTC,"I started sequestering the soon-to-be-tossed pizzas in their own clean bags/boxes when one day after my day shift, a homeless man came up to me where I was smoking a cig by my car (the employees all park adjacent to the dumpster), and said ""you guys throw out a lot of good food. I come by here a few times a week to eat. It's great."" and I realized that he had to have been picking the leftover slices out from the same bag that all the dish washing scraps get scraped into, which also included myriad other gross stuff. I couldn't believe I hadn't considered the possibility sooner.   Ever since then I make sure that I always grab whatever's slated to be tossed and put it in its own separate bag, or ideally an actual pizza box if I can snag one, and put it out separately. I felt so guilty that this human being had to dig through actual garbage to find perfectly good, edible and frankly, tasty food. Hell, I take some toss able slices home myself most nights. Why shouldn't they get the benefit of it being clean?  So much good could be done with just a little forethought and minimal effort... Our society has been conditioned incorrectly."
DumpsterDiving,3dyki8,YarnYarn,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:53:26 2015 UTC,I'm glad to hear you are doing that. :)   I worked for a top pizza chain for 14 years. In my store the our employee's cared about the waste and worked together to reduce it or distribute it. My boss allowed us to bag and box leftover buffet as often as we could and take them to people we knew with low incomes. Legally if she or we had ever been caught doing that we would have been fired.  I'm glad she let us.   Honestly though it still is theft. Those bags and boxes used to transport the food wasn't free to the owner. I started to feel guilty after having had done it for a few years and started to bring reusable containers.

DumpsterDiving,3dyki8,mywan,4,Mon Jul 20 21:36:01 2015 UTC,"I work at a gas station / C-store. I'd estimate that we throw away about $300 worth of prepared food weekly. Not stuff we make on-site, but stuff that is delivered thrice-weekly - pre-made fresh sandwiches, yogurt cups, fruit cups, donuts, etc. Lots of milk goes straight down the drain, probably 10% or more of what we order. Burritos, breakfast sandwiches, you name it. And then there is the regular packaged food that gets tossed - stuff past its best-by date, like energy bars, snack chips, nuts, juices, etc. All of this straight into the dumpster. I salvage what I can, as safely as possible, but I'd certainly be written up by my Ops Manager if he found out. I'm a good employee, and they're not super hard-asses, so I wouldn't (I think) be fired for a first offense. But it's all just so fucking disgusting. Nothing gets donated or distributed to those who need it, because of fear of lawsuits."

It's great to finally learn that it is complete and utter bullshit.   I have to give credit to my local Earth Fare though. They actually give me a car load of produce every time I stop in. I freeze it, can it, use it to feed my livestock, and if anything is left, it gets composted to use on the garden.  The produce manager actually thanks me for taking it. I'm not sure if this is company wide policy what they are doing, but if anyone is thinking about saving loads of organic and natural produce from the landfills, be sure to check with Earth Fare."

DumpsterDiving,3dw95z,FifthGateOpen,13,Mon Jul 20 01:35:13 2015 UTC,"Go alone. Ride a bike. It's much easier and the bike lets you get in deeper without actually having to dive.   Bring a lot of plastic bags and an exacto knife. Cut rotten parts off veggies so you're not carrying a around a lot of rotten food. I also like wearing gardening gloves. It's just nice than getting ick all over your hands.   Generally I don't dumpster salad greens or anything that I would eat raw. It's also good to know what are safe-ish levels of rot or mold. Generally a mold spot on a hard dense veggie like pepper, carrot  or a zucchini is fine if you cut off a 1""area around the mold spot. On soft fruits and veggies no mold is acceptable. Use your good judgement  and sense of smell.   When you get home with your haul wash everything immediately in white vinegar and rinse with water. Process everything right away. Cut off rot. Throw away bad pieces. Turn everything into salsa, soup, sauce etc ASAP as it tends to keep better this way and is more acceptable to your roommates or whoever. Generally it's better to cook dumpstered food since it will kill most of the anaerobic bacteria that it might have come in contact with. Packages foods are generally fine even if they are past their best before dates. For everything but meat if it smalls good and looks good and you can wash it you probably won't have a problem. If you have to make judgement call err on the side of your health and caution.   If you run into someone be polite. Say hi. If they tell you to leave leave. Be clean and respectful and usually you won't have problems. It's always best to go shortly after businesses close for the best hauls.   Good luck."
DumpsterDiving,3dw95z,Erinaceous,5,Mon Jul 20 03:09:04 2015 UTC,"Depends on curfew laws. Either, my answer to number 1 assumes nighttime diving. Yes, but you may end up making a few trips. Depends on the area and time you go, also depends on if you are a girl. No offense, but someone may see a young girl hanging out near the dumpsters and be more likely to mess you than if you are or are with a boy. Avoid restaurants, and stores that share dumpsters with restaurants...   And since you're 15, make sure your phone is fully charged and your parents know where you're going."
DumpsterDiving,3dw95z,Dick_n_a_Box,3,Mon Jul 20 03:09:03 2015 UTC,"Miscellaneous advice: Tape your flashlight to a magnet, stick it to the dumpster (it's less conspicuous than a headlamp).  Make sure the employees are all gone before diving (places like Panera has employees hanging out way after closing time).  If you're biding time, just pull out your cell phone, it makes you pretty much invisible to passers by.  Start a little journal to record what days you find empty/full dumpsters, so you can find out the garbage pick-up days, and at what time stores clear out.  Most importantly, don't give up.  I still have bad nights, just don't get discouraged.  Try a different night of the week, try new dumpsters, and learn to enjoy the Zen of diving."
DumpsterDiving,3dw95z,BerlinSpecimen,2,Mon Jul 20 14:16:40 2015 UTC,"1A. There is no age limit 1B. Depends on the area 2.

At your age, make friends that would go with you to be on the safe side, if your area is ""safe"" then you can probably go alone. 5. Depends whats in your area.

DumpsterDiving,3dw95z,novack64,2,Tue Jul 21 06:06:49 2015 UTC,"I think so, most they do is tell you to leave or call the cops. Nothing like a walmart/target/<insert store name> employee that thinks they know more then you and the laws.  Also look out for cameras. Walmart has a shit ton of them same with other big name stores/malls.  But one thing with cameras, some places put up fake ones or if they are real security cameras, there is a chance that its not hooked up. Nothing like walking past a security camera and notice that there are not cables or have those cheap ass stickers on the sides with a fake brand name or just generic as hell."

The mantra is ""Reduce, Reuse, Recycle"" and that order is explicit. If you really must use more, then do so. If you really can't re-use, then dispose of. If you must dispose of it, do so safely.  This could easily be re-used. It should not have even touched a recycling box. I see no ethical/moral issue here.1     It's probs illegal though shrug"

DumpsterDiving,3doah5,lordloss,1 point,Sat Jul 18 01:26:44 2015 UTC,"I would also argue that to maximize the utility of this phone you should reuse it, or sell it, after wiping clean. That phone provides veryyyy little recycling ""power"". It's a few grams of plastic and metals. It can make a substantial difference to an individual however. Furthermore, there was no explicit contract between either party for this device, since it was left in a presumably public location in an open box. Neither party could make a legitimate claim to ownership, since the recycling plant doesn't know it exists yet and the previous owner abandoned it."
DumpsterDiving,3doah5,Warrior77777,2,Sat Jul 18 04:22:40 2015 UTC,"It's pretty crazy how much new usage you can get out of a phone by wiping it clean. Tons of people have been dumping their iPhone 4S lately because iOS updates have been getting sluggish. So I got one for my wife, and the first thing we did was upgrade it to the latest version. Absolutely no problems, all that ""instability"" that people moan about on the internet isn't even present.  This is a well-known fact in the Android community (explicitly people who get deep into Android). It applies to any phone, with any software updates. Hardcore Windows users know it too. You will always get better performance from a clean wipe than trying to update while holding onto everything. There's always kinks in the upgrade process.  But the average end user doesn't know about this, so these ""recycling"" companies conjure up fancy images of green grass and the moral highground, and people happily drop off their phones. And they end up turning these massive profits because they simply reset the phone as we all should've done."

DumpsterDiving,3doah5,Warrior77777,40,Mon Jul 20 05:07:47 2015 UTC,"The person put it in the recycling box because they no longer wanted it, so you should not feel guilty about the former owner. As yolostein said, you are kind of taking it from the company who profits off the items inside the recycling box, but I would not consider taking it unethical. It is similar to taking something from the trash on the curb. The garage company stays in business because they are paid to pick up everyone's waste, but if they have a little less waste to remove, it is not like they will go out of business."
DumpsterDiving,3doah5,bigblacksquirrel,12,Fri Jul 17 22:56:48 2015 UTC,"To play devil's advocate, OP might be interfering with the previous owner if he disposed of the phone specifically to benefit the recycling service."

DumpsterDiving,3doah5,Swiftdaggers,13,Sat Jul 18 09:44:23 2015 UTC,"If their intent was to recycle it, seeing it wiped then reused is better for the environment. The recycling places would end up disassembling it, smelting it, and sending the materials in ingot form to buyers. Recycling cell phones is way better than putting them in a landfill, but way worse than reuse. Smelting is not exactly a green industry."
DumpsterDiving,3doah5,adamdreaming,0,Sat Jul 18 13:48:46 2015 UTC,"But if you think about it, that recycling company spent time and money setting up a business and advertising that that's the place people can recycle things.  Even though they get them for free, they paid a lot of money to have that opportunity.  Taking things from their box is like the same as stealing donations that were left outside a goodwill.  That being said, I probably would have taken it as well.  we can all be a bit unethical at times."
DumpsterDiving,3doah5,Barbaric_Emu,2,Sat Jul 18 05:33:10 2015 UTC,"wtf is this? Setting up a business means everyone has to readjust their lives to respect your business' goals?

We spend lots of money on commercials and magazine ads to advertise that we are the place to go to sell your phone.  If people want to compete so be it but don't mooch off our hard work.  Find your own way to do it.  I'm not saying it's illegal but unethical"
DumpsterDiving,3doah5,Barbaric_Emu,6,Sat Jul 18 17:41:28 2015 UTC,"I don't think that's even minutely unethical. We are material girls living in a material world and people don't owe it to you to not compete with you just because there are some problems with your business plan. The business you work at does not have some moral primacy over other people's economic activity just because you advertise. Your hard work is merely revealing that you're uncompetitive. Frankly if we're talking about ethics, the most unethical thing I can see is that you guys are using advertising muscle to give people less money for their phones.  EDIT: In my neighborhood, the corner delis buy and sell old (and stolen) phones (on the down-low). If your kiosk came in and set up shop, how much money would you have to spend on advertising before you got the right to complain that they were undercutting you with better offers? Answer: It's a ridiculous complaint and the amount you spend on advertising clearly has nothing to do with the business you're somehow entitled to."
DumpsterDiving,3doah5,grumpenprole,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:15:55 2015 UTC,"Sounds like you work at a mall kiosk. You need to report this activity to mall security so the people doing it can be asked to leave. It is private property and you are paying a premium to rent that space and run your business. No solicitation rules apply and the non licensed competitors cannot legally do that.   With that said, you are comparing apples to oranges in the case of the recycle phone in this thread. I agree that taking it is fair game, not unethical at all."

The fact that they wiped it lets you know they didn't drop it in there on accident.    But recycling is the same as trash, unless it's like a specific drive to benefit some charity.  But otherwise, it's just another form of trash, and there's nothing unethical about getting things out of it.    We know that some people judge us or think it's unseemly to dig through trash.  But in this community, we see that if there is something in the trash of value, it makes logical (and moral!) sense to use it or improve it.    So more power to you.  Good find.  Maybe change the cover or something, since you'll be using it and live in the office of the donator (avoid judgement)."

You don't even know what their wishes were, but if we were to speculate (which, to be clear, you've already done), what's more likely: That this person deposited the phone here in the hopes that this company could profit off of it, or that this person deposited the phone here because trashing it is bad for the environment? You're assuming the former. No assumption needs to be made, but the former makes much less sense than the latter. If someone leaves trash on the street, is it unethical to move it, because they left it there with a specific intent? Why is this different from anything else you might snag from a dumpster? How can you dumpster-dive while believing that (a) previous owners have specific arcs in mind for the items they throw out and (b) their wishes have some kind of ethical primacy over their trash? Why is this scenario framed as the diver imposing their justice on the person who threw out the phone? That sounds insane to me. Even assuming that the previous owner has an idea of a just arc for this phone that precludes someone else using it -- which is an absolutely ludicrous assumption -- why is that the just outcome, and taking it a somehow unjust outcome?"

OP intercepted property that was exchanged in a business transaction.  The original owner made a choice of what to do with their property, and who to give it to.  It wasn't discarded as ""trash"".  It was recycled for a fee and with an intent.  You dont get free dibs on items that are still going through a business cycle.  OP is interfering with the recycling process for personal gain, instead of letting the related businesses thrive from the business.   This isnt dumpster diving.  This is stealing."
DumpsterDiving,3doah5,Empyrealist,1 point,Sat Jul 18 19:41:39 2015 UTC,"If property rights and business transactions are the basis of your ethics, whatever. If the fee has been paid, it's now pure profit for the company. They probably wish all the phones would be stolen between the fee being paid and the actual recycling process happening -- unless, of course, they make more money than the processing costs from reselling the materials, in which case charging a fee is scummy in the first place, a blatantly unethical cashing-in on people's environmental concerns. If they aren't profiting from the resale, then all actual recycling is a loss for them. The ""theft"" is better for the company. Even if the ""business thriving"" was supposed to be an ethical priority, the ""theft"" is better for the company.  Now, the original owner. They did this because they care about the environment. Of course you know that recycling is massively more wasteful than reusing. Recycling is the last of the three Rs. Reusing is the first.  I really don't like that your idea of ""ethics"" comes from property rights, and businesses pursuing profits get some ethical primacy. But in this case, even from the business' point of view, this is a perfect profit."

I'm seeing too much rationalization going on. You don't/can't know the motivations or intentions of the original owner, unless you speak to them directly. If you really want to be ethical, contact the original owner if you can, explain to them how you came into possession of the phone, and whether it's ok with them for you to have it. For all YOU know, they may have had some sensitive data on the phone that they wanted professionally destroyed. I would hope they took their sim card and any memory cards out, but there's still the possibility some of the phone ID numbers could be connected to this person & their account.

A few questions I have/you might want to ask yourself: -what kind of garbage are you interested in? retail, residential, office/industrial? -what time of day are you diving? -how often do you go treasure hunting? -do you keep track of when trash is picked up at your preferred location(s)? -are there local laws against interfering with discarded items? -how do you feel about confrontation with observers and/or law enforcement?"
DumpsterDiving,3djbn1,misterthriftster,2,Fri Jul 17 10:55:10 2015 UTC,Curious about your answers to these:  -what time of day are you diving?  -how often do you go treasure hunting?  -how do you feel about confrontation with observers and/or law enforcement?
DumpsterDiving,3djbn1,DreadsMcGee,4,Fri Jul 17 11:58:01 2015 UTC,"Edit: I'd like to know your answers, too!   I go mostly stupid late at night or stupid early in the morning for the pharmacy hauls. For residential, I like to go around 6am on trash day. Just realized, IT'S TRASH DAY! Sadly, I only make it out a couple times a week. I aim for Fridays for residential. I have so much food right now that it's hard to justify getting more and bringing it home...but I'd love to go daily. Until my brush with law enforcement, I didn't mind and I'd do it pretty matter-of-factly cause I thought it was legal. Now, I'll still do it blatantly in Las Vegas, rather than in Henderson. I've been telling people I come into contact with about my recent finds...I think most people just don't realize what kinds of things are being tossed. I didn't for a really long time. I'm respectful but not apologetic about my hobby and I'm working to be open about it. I'm hoping that by educating the people I have contact with, eventually there can be a real discussion and hopefully a change in my municipality's laws... eventually"
DumpsterDiving,3djbn1,DreadsMcGee,2,Fri Jul 17 13:04:03 2015 UTC,You get all of this in Vegas?? I never find anything at the pharmacies D;

DumpsterDiving,3dl9zv,Diverfree,3,Fri Jul 17 04:41:11 2015 UTC,"Not from Phoenix (I'm in NV) but you should check out chain pharmacies for some snackage! I respect you for not taking more than you'll use but if you find that you're probably the only one doing the recovery, you might consider trying to take as much as you can and finding a place to share the love :)"
DumpsterDiving,3dl9zv,vividfix,1 point,Fri Jul 17 11:25:55 2015 UTC,I appreciate the recommendation! Will give chain pharms a try. I also appreciate your thought about giving it away if it seems I'm the only one recovering the stuff - I'll do that.

DumpsterDiving,3dgjtx,Dorinthian,6,Thu Jul 16 02:31:31 2015 UTC,"I live in a college town and usually go between 2:30-4AM. Late enough that the bar crowd has gone home, early enough that the morning delivery trucks haven't started arriving yet. I don't like to be disturbed.  Holding a flashlight is no problem when you have a headlamp! Best diving purchase you can make if you plan on going after dark."
DumpsterDiving,3dgjtx,Von_Moistus,10,Thu Jul 16 15:19:34 2015 UTC,"I go in broad daylight. I'm just looking for boxes or cans if anyone asks. No one cares, though you get some funny looks sometimes. Way less sketchy. And no one is going to take you to court for looking for some boxes at 5PM."
DumpsterDiving,3dgjtx,Warrior77777,3,Thu Jul 16 04:38:01 2015 UTC,I prefer nights because it a lot cooler and not that much traffic. You also get first dibs on the trash as its taken out plus no weird looks. Lol
DumpsterDiving,3dgjtx,paolobabe99,3,Thu Jul 16 05:56:06 2015 UTC,"I usually go at night. But now when I stop at Aldi's for groceries I'll scope out the dumpster. No one really cares much, I usually just park and walk to the dumpster. But I haven't ran in to an employee at all yet. I haven't tried any other places in the day time though."
DumpsterDiving,3dgjtx,brianpepinski,2,Thu Jul 16 08:20:51 2015 UTC,So far going late at night has worked well for me. Haven't encountered anyone at all and I've been to places both out in the open and closed off.
DumpsterDiving,3dgjtx,mistaek,2,Thu Jul 16 04:11:55 2015 UTC,"Day is much much easier, no flashlight to hold. Personally I like to go around dusk or early morning. Its easier to play off why you are there imo."
DumpsterDiving,3dgjtx,criosphynx,2,Thu Jul 16 04:19:54 2015 UTC,"Day:  more likely to get caught, but if you do get caught you'll probably just be asked to leave at worst.  Night:  less likely to get caught, but if you are caught it will probably be by police since you seem suspicious or something.  Depends on the location, its hours, and how visible you are."
DumpsterDiving,3dgjtx,imnotminkus,2,Fri Jul 17 18:20:09 2015 UTC,"I prefer nights as well, around 2am. Especially since it's summer and night is much cooler (and fewer people). I've also gotten a lot of chocolate, so if it's thrown out and retrieved at night, you don't have to worry about melting as much."
DumpsterDiving,3de8ot,mistaek,23,Wed Jul 15 16:13:57 2015 UTC,They do this to prevent people from taking a slightly broken chair and repairing it instead of buying a new one.

DumpsterDiving,3de8ot,sarahabea,5,Wed Jul 15 21:21:26 2015 UTC,"I work for a company that renovates restaurants and we always take out pristine, beautiful furniture. We used to donate it all but about a year ago a child fell off one of the chairs we donated and got hurt. The mother sued and now we are no longer permitted to donate our furniture so we have to throw it all away. It kills me every time.  I am allowed to take furniture for personal use, but I can not sell it, or I would be fired."
DumpsterDiving,3de8ot,FishTamer,5,Thu Jul 16 13:29:04 2015 UTC,So one rotten person ruined it for the rest. That's so frustrating.

DumpsterDiving,3de8ot,FishTamer,3,Fri Jul 17 03:27:40 2015 UTC,Something to do with taxes and write offs.
DumpsterDiving,3de8ot,cesariojpn,7,Wed Jul 15 21:51:57 2015 UTC,I think they get the same writeoff for donating.
DumpsterDiving,3de8ot,Dick_n_a_Box,5,Wed Jul 15 22:59:02 2015 UTC,"Can you source this? They write it off as a loss means they take the whole price that it could have sold. If they wrote it off as a donation, it's just a percentage."
DumpsterDiving,3de8ot,DrSphincter,2,Thu Jul 16 04:40:34 2015 UTC,In fact a better writeoff

DumpsterDiving,3de8ot,3rdLevelRogue,14,Wed Jul 15 19:41:12 2015 UTC,They also do this because some customers steal take these chairs and try to get a refund for it.

DumpsterDiving,3dggok,JasonKraisins,1 point,Sat Jul 18 02:32:14 2015 UTC,"Aw man. Trash compactors suck. I would stay away from them because more than half the time they are locked up tight, and the ones that are not, can be pretty dangerous. I see ones that have two openings, one inside the store and another outside. So someone throws something away in the store while you're digging around, and then starts the compactor. It would be terrifying at the least. If you didn't loose you legs instead. So I just stay away from them. But awesome I'm glad my video was a small inspiration! :) Haha."
DumpsterDiving,3dggok,JasonKraisins,1 point,Sun Jul 19 02:43:43 2015 UTC,"Haha yeah I have a small fear of getting crushed to death, for sure. Where can you access the contents from outside?

DumpsterDiving,3dggok,JasonKraisins,1 point,Sun Jul 19 02:46:21 2015 UTC,"Sometimes they have a door on the side of it. Like I said before though, they are normally locked up tight.

DumpsterDiving,3dcxa3,jaynarg,7,Wed Jul 15 07:56:32 2015 UTC,"I know it's not the only disease to worry about but it is certainly the worst. HIV does not live long outside the body (dies almost instantly upon contact with the air) and cannot live on surfaces. It can remain live in the barrel of a needle for ""some"" time (lets call it X), but if you were to get poked, chances are that needle has been in the dumpster for longer than X time and the blood has shifted around, exposing the virus to the air.   Now I'm not saying there is absolutely no risk. There are always freak accidents that occur. But it should put your mind at ease a bit.   With that said I'm still concerned about my own safety. Beware of rainwater, that shit has enough stuff breeding in it to make you sick for days. My diving gear is a poor mans hazmat suit. Raw denim jeans with elastic affixed to the bottom which goes over my boots. For up top I have an old Carhartt jacket I found attached to some thick snow gloves. Pretty rigid material, not easy for a syringe to poke through unless I was laying down making garbage angels."

Worst thing I have seen was some broken glass.   Jumping into a dumpster is your own choice. There have been a few which had some shelving thrown out, which made a stable platform. The large majority of the time though we access the dumpster from the main hatch or the side hatches, the side hatches are typically much better."
DumpsterDiving,3dcxa3,criosphynx,3,Wed Jul 15 12:10:46 2015 UTC,I find medical waste on a steady basis and never have seen blades or needles. Personally I don't jump in. I have a stick with a hook to bring things up to me.
DumpsterDiving,3dcxa3,nocontroll,3,Thu Jul 16 04:18:15 2015 UTC,That is a very good question and I want to hear an answer from someone.
DumpsterDiving,3dcxa3,Warrior77777,3,Wed Jul 15 11:15:29 2015 UTC,I never just jump in. I move stuff gently so I have a platform of wood or metal and then only step there while I throw a few bags around. It's pretty easy to only touch the things you know are ok like the tops of bags and only grab surfaces that are clearly not hiding anything.
DumpsterDiving,3dcxa3,Asminja,2,Thu Jul 16 04:41:22 2015 UTC,"Luckily I live in a pretty nice area. But I know not everyone is considerate, and I heard horror stories growing up about these things. I think I'm going to look around for some sort of fireplace poker or something to move stuff around, and if i need to absolutely go in maybe some rain boots for my feet? I'd feel safer if my ankles and feet weren't completely exposed. I've never even really looked inside of a dumpster so I'm not sure how realistic it is to even get inside."
DumpsterDiving,3dcxa3,vividfix,2,Thu Jul 16 00:37:39 2015 UTC,"For poking around, I just bought a cheap wooden dowel from the craft section of walmart and added these little wall hooks to it. That way if you have to ever leave it behind or replace it, it's super cheap and easy."
DumpsterDiving,3dcxa3,thesurfingwalrus,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:55:19 2015 UTC,Yeah i was thinking about just staying on the outside unless I see something really worth it that's out of reach. I don't want to take unnecessary risks.
DumpsterDiving,3dcxa3,Scraplington,2,Wed Jul 15 20:14:16 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately, the retailer that I have the best luck at seems to have a majority of the goods at the very bottom of the dumpster- and usually buried beneath bags of stinky, wet, and/or dirty garbage.    With that being said, my lucky retailer also happens to be a pharmacy. I'm happy to not have run into any detectable medical waste from those bins, although seeing a dead animal (cat, maybe) was enough to send me home for the night.    A couple weeks ago, I was a bit perturbed when an intriguing bag of residential trash from the community across the way turned out to be medical waste. I was genuinely disgusted last week, as I frollicked in a large dumpster that appears often in the same area. By the amount of large furniture and other household items the container has, I suppose it is used to dispose of abandoned items following an eviction or move-out. In this instance, it smelled like crap, literally, and when I unveiled a full box of used adult diapers I understood why.   I think I need a folding stool of some kind to get into dumpsters..I lack the height + upper body strength to hoist myself in. Then there's always the fear of being able to get out. I definitely try to stand on something hard and I try to move everything I'm not working with out of my way so there's no accidental pokes, jabs, or stabs.  In all, I'm happy to say I've not found needles (or any other paraphernalia, aside from a few remnants of cannabis plants in the aforementioned dumpster across the way) in the short time I've been personally diving, nor in the years that the trash has been brought to me to sift through!"

DumpsterDiving,3dcxa3,vividfix,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:00:23 2015 UTC,"I never thought about that until now! I thought it was common knowledge to always dispose of needles/knives in sharps containers and taken to a pharmacy.   Depending on the areas class, i'd say stay away from any low income areas where people would throw out heroin needles, shivs, blades or weapons. Even if it sounds insane, my friend found a pair of bladed brass knuckles that could have cut his finger off.  Broken glass is expected, its what dumpsters are for. Knives or needles however are possibly illegal or demonstrate a very dangerous part of town"
DumpsterDiving,3d9d3v,Schiffty5,7,Tue Jul 14 14:57:17 2015 UTC,"Check the office supply chain stores, dollar stores, and smaller grocery stores (big supermarkets will have compactors) near you. People find stuff at video game stores, too. Keep trying pharmacies, even though a lot of them have locked dumpsters you might find a few that are accessible. Another good one is the ""BBB"" store which has items to fill your sleeping room, showering room, and...beyond! They throw away items returned by customers.  If you know of a freeway exit just outside the city that has a whole ton of big box stores, go scout it out.

Make a route out of the productive ones. Craft stores (watch out for glass), thrift stores (vintage and clothes), music stores, malls and strip malls, stuff like that. The office stores are dead, adapt or you will find nothing."

DumpsterDiving,3d6ry3,publicradio,9,Tue Jul 14 00:48:32 2015 UTC,"I have an old kodak camera from that same line. They're fairly common lower to mid range cameras from that era. If it's the model that takes 620 film, you can respool 120 film onto the old reels and still use it. The frame numbers will even line up properly. If it's 116 or 616, 70mm motion picture stock could be used, but you'll need to come up with your own backing paper. I've also run 120 film through 116 cameras, but I had to cut down some old spools to make a shim so it would be wide enough. You end up with a more panoramic format this way, since the film format is narrower than the original.  Due to age, the bellows are likely to have developed pinholes and will likely bleed light. Put a bright flashlight inside and you'll see whether it's light-tight or not. Black nail polish usually works for very small holes, but any larger rips will need to be taped. Most people use black hockey tape for bellows repairs."

To me it seems like the need for computer-power have leveled off, and even though you got Mores-law and all that, computers that are a few years old run more or less all programs and many games without a problem.  Since I'm a bit of a /r/pcmasterrace/, I'd not bother too much with anything less than a dual core. But an old single-core pentium is more than enough for a file-server or whatnot.    If you check benchmarks for the different CPU's/GPU's, and add a little experience, you'll quickly learn what's good enough for your use."

Include drug stores nearby and auto parts stores and whatever else. Then just do a drive by. Find the bin for each place, and make note of any security cameras, locked gates, no trespassing signs etc so you can mark those locations off the list.

My mom and I used to go on ""trash night cruises"" through the apartment complexes and housing developments in my small hometown, it was always a blast. Good luck!"

If you're going to try curbing, I usually check for ""clues"" at the curb. One or 2 bags at the curb usually means food type stinky garbage, people usually keep that type of trash in cans as well so animals don't get to it. Once you start seeing multiple bags, it means there's been a clean up going on. Better clues I usually look out for at the curb are boxes, lamps, large picture frames and furniture. If you see any of this stuff, it's always worth stopping to take a quick peek at what's in the accompanying bags. Good luck! :)"

Well just as we stopped and were going to jump out and look at the dumpsters there we saw headlights and unluckily it was a cop. So as quick and discreet as we could we slipped off our headlamps and gloves. He motioned for us to head back out and so we did and took a left to get to the street and he followed us. We wanted to hit our next destination a street over from us so we stopped in the parking lot and acted like we were Gpsing directions,but luckily he stopped following us and we were good. We hide next to a dumpster another time while a guy walked to his car right in front of where we were.

DumpsterDiving,3d5cey,Xkimberxkae,3,Mon Jul 13 17:26:41 2015 UTC,"Last night I made a board on all sorts of pins from tips to dive to what you can do with what you find. https://www.pinterest.com/Ambermsj/diving/ I would recommend you try cvs. They don't use compactors. If you live in the city it is a great place to hit. Been finding so many snacks with my boyfriend there and the food isn't expired plus the dumpsters are a lot cleaner. Another place I would check is a home furniture store like bed bath and beyond or Trader Joes. If you don't mind getting more dirty than check small chain grocery stores since they don't have compactors normally. For places to stay away from I would say any restaurant or pizza place,those are the places that smell the worst. Make sure you wear thicker shoes and gloves that wont rip easily,than a headlamp is convenient so you wont need to hold anything and use both hands."
DumpsterDiving,3d5cey,ambii92,2,Tue Jul 14 01:23:55 2015 UTC,Forgot to mention that it's best to go an hour after places close or in the early morning.
DumpsterDiving,3d5cey,ambii92,2,Tue Jul 14 01:37:01 2015 UTC,"places like gamestop=always worth checking  if you're looking for food try those health places that sell snack bars and drink formulas. grocery stores are always worth it. there is no right or wrong! every store is different from town to town. just get right into it. don't go to places that are gated off, you're gonna have a bad time if you trespass. wear gloves, any gloves will do."
DumpsterDiving,3d5cey,DRoyLinker,1 point,Mon Jul 13 22:45:50 2015 UTC,"Figure out what you are interested in getting first.    Big chains like Wal-Mart and Food Lion, as well as most malls, will have trash compactors, so it might not behoove you to go there.  If you want clothes, go dive residential areas instead of big box stores. People throwing their clothes out tend to wash them. Not only that, they also don't take knives to their garments.  Always go to Game Stop, Vitamin City, and GNC. Their product tends to do well.  See a broken flat panel tv, take it home with you. Apparently, it's an easy fix, something about capacitors, but also because it's still worth something to people who repair them for a living."

DumpsterDiving,3d2oy9,chuggZ,3,Mon Jul 13 06:39:09 2015 UTC,"They're almost impossible to chop once you freeze them (a lot of water in a potato, surprisingly!) so I'd recommend chopping them how you like first (fries, home fries, etc.) and taking off skins if those aren't your thing.  Also, don't deep-fry frozen potatoes. Thaw them first. Otherwise you may die. (Frozen water + fryer oil = explosive vaporizing)"
DumpsterDiving,3d2oy9,ShadeJackrabbit,2,Mon Jul 13 21:01:03 2015 UTC,Do storebought frozen fries have something in them to prevent this? Totally did that a thousand times as a kid

DumpsterDiving,3cz99q,Mentalish,14,Sun Jul 12 04:32:39 2015 UTC,"I used to work retail. We buy candy (usually way too much of it) to stock at the registers. It never all sells before it expires.

DumpsterDiving,3cz99q,EmilyamI,3,Sun Jul 12 04:37:21 2015 UTC,Is it good past expiration date?
DumpsterDiving,3cz99q,Mentalish,11,Sun Jul 12 04:43:10 2015 UTC,"I would say so. Expiration date on non-perishables is more of a suggestion, I think."
DumpsterDiving,3cz99q,EmilyamI,14,Sun Jul 12 04:47:00 2015 UTC,"If candy has peanuts or any kind of nuts and it's expired, it tastes awful. Found that out with Payday, I work at a gas station where we throw out a fair amount of expired candy, and stale peanuts are gross"
DumpsterDiving,3cz99q,scabdick,1 point,Sun Jul 12 05:45:45 2015 UTC,They shouldn't be stale immediately after the expiration date unless they were stored in a warm place.

DumpsterDiving,3cz99q,scabdick,6,Wed Jul 15 05:50:39 2015 UTC,Like Ive always thought stuff like chocolate would be safe past expiration cause its just a chocolate bar no bread or what ever with it like a cookie (half awake here roll with me).
DumpsterDiving,3cz99q,Mentalish,11,Sun Jul 12 04:51:19 2015 UTC,"The biggest issue pushing the expiration date would be oxidation.  Expired chocolate might taste a little off if it's really old, but it's not going to kill you.  If it's full on spoiled it'll be obvious."

DumpsterDiving,3crcnd,frozensalad,3,Fri Jul 10 03:51:15 2015 UTC,"Try going to places other than the big box stores, as they almost always have compactors. Also try locations in strip malls, as they usually have shared dumpsters (hopefully not next to a restaurant! Those are usually pretty nasty inside) and not compactors.   Also, keep track of where you go and what days. You'll have to figure out the stores garbage cycle. Most of the time they throw inventory away the day before garbage pick up.   For example if you go and the dumpster is empty or only has a bag or two, it's safe to assume that was probably just picked up, so next week go the day before.   Before long, you'll see a pattern and can  make a ""route"" of sorts."

DumpsterDiving,3cq7ro,retrobuddha,3,Fri Jul 10 18:54:50 2015 UTC,"As a general rule if the dumpster smells really bad I won't dive in. Depending on what you're looking for/where you're diving will depend on if you need to get into the dumpster or if it will be bagged etc. For instance, an office store I frequent throws away returns without destroying them. These are often thrown away in their original box and not in a garbage bag. However, a world market in town throws away packaged foods in a large garbage bag. Depending on how you're feeling it's sometimes worth tearing open a few bags (just don't make a mess)  Any specific questions you have that I didn't answer?"

DumpsterDiving,3cq7ro,uma100,4,Tue Jul 14 05:21:28 2015 UTC,"It really depends on what you want to look for and how far you want to go. In my city, I've found that food places are disgusting, and I can barely bring myself to check the GameStop dumpster because it's attached to a food place. For me, there's a few different ways I like to go about diving:   Business and Retail dumpsters These are where I do a lot of my diving, simply because I can find new or like-new items that are being tossed for minor defects. Some places that people tend to find hauls include GameStop and five below. I can message you a list of my top spots if you like. Apartment and Residential diving Occasionally I will make rounds out to the apartments around me, but the last few days of the month are usually when people move out. Move-outs mean people toss things they can't fit into their moving vans. This brings me to my next point: College move outs College kids are some of the most wasteful people around. Come May when they are graduating or going back home for the summer, there's a lot of items that they just leave behind because, I assume, they have no room for it, or they have one at home already (mini fridges come to mind). I've found lots of clothing, even some beer that was never drank. Get a look at your local college's schedule, and keep an eye on the apartments around it towards graduation. If you are feeling brave enough, you could even look around the dorms on campus for dumpsters, as they tend to rent huge roll away dumpsters. And that brings up another point: Rollaway dumpsters If you see one of these, it usually means the person who rented it has a lot to get rid of. Now, I've had only a little experience with them, but if you see them on Residential property, you should ask the owner before taking a look. It could be considered trespassing and theft if you are caught on their property taking stuff like that. If it's behind a business, it may be a goldmine, or it may be remodeling crap like broken floorboards and counters. Either way, businesses are typically regarded as public areas, but if there are posted no trespassing signs, I'd say don't chance it.  Curb Alerts While not technically dumpster diving, I find that in my city, every week when the trash is set on the curb for pickup the next morning, there is usually a couple places that have piles of stuff out. I tend to go for these more often because I can usually just walk to them. These can also be a lot of fun since collectibles and such aren't usually tossed commercially.    There's no general rule for dumpsters: items can be in boxes, bags, out in the open, or some places even set things in a cart next to the dumpster. If you see something at the bottom of a dumpster that you want to grab, only get in if you know you can get out. NEVER go into a compactor. Clothing, I typically wear whatever to make it look like I'm just a regular person. I'm not trying to look like a burglar that's casing the place, and I also don't want to draw too much attention to myself. Shoes, I wear my usual sneakers unless I know there's gonna be water at the bottoms of the dumpsters, which is when I wear boots."
DumpsterDiving,3cqij2,AbbyJaneway,3,Thu Jul 9 23:34:48 2015 UTC,"Also from the East bay near El Cerrito (but leaving the area soon). I have found the best results from rich areas that are low-traffic. I tried El Cerrito mall once and found locked dumpsters everywhere except outside Trader Joe's was accidentally unlocked, but didn't find much good stuff there.   I talked to a homeless guy once while diving and gave him some food I found, and it was pleasant. I don't think you need to worry about homeless people treating you badly anymore than non-homeless people. If anything, homeless people might treat you nicer because they may not judge you for diving like a non-homeless person may. I also have dived (trash bins on streets)  in front of random bystanders at night, who were like 10 feet away. Usually they walk away because they feel uncomfortable, and sometimes they ask me if I'm finding anything good - so don't worry about that either.  Recycling vs. trash: other than color, I don't know.  Good food dumpsters come from bakeries, pastry places. Anywhere that needs new fresh food every single day. Also anywhere that sells pre-packaged things that expire, such as Starbucks (bistro boxes, sandwiches, etc.). Starbucks is very wasteful and if you can find one with unlocked dumpsters, such as the one on Solano, you've hit a goldmine. Noah's Bagels is also great every few days. They will often fill up the top of a trash bin with bagels, and most of them will just be touching other bagels, = clean. Let me know if you have more local questions.  EDIT: I just remembered a guy I met at a rock show recommended the Asian Ghetto in downtown Berkeley. I only went once, and there were homeless people scavenging when I was there so I didn't look further so as to take away from their opportunity. But for what it's worth he said he got fresh Asian food there every night."
DumpsterDiving,3cqij2,Diverfree,2,Fri Jul 10 05:58:03 2015 UTC,"First off, I'm not a food diver.  I dive for electronics and other non-edible items.  I would recommend suburban areas more.  They're more sleepy and less likely to have others around.  Don't worry too much about the homeless people.  I ran into one homeless guy who set up shop at the REI dumpster, he even had a mini display tent!  Nice set up!  I respected his 'territory' and left.  No confrontation.  Although, if I were you, I would still have something I could use to defend myself with, when a smile doesn't work, just in case.  Like your trash-poking stick.    In my experience, people will ignore you while you're diving.  You become a homeless person, or beggar to them and it's embarrassing to look at you.  I've even had security guards drive by me in their cars and just keep on driving.  Not even a second glance.  Just walk up to the dumpster with confidence and no one will question you.    In my area, most rubbish dumpsters are green and most recycle dumpsters are white.  But I have found xbox 360's and wireless headsets in cardboard only (white) dumpsters, so it's good to glance either way.  I would grab a journal and keep notes on when you go out, what areas you go to, and what you find.  It's also good to note if things are locked or if the dumpsters have trash pick up days written on the outside.  (So the day right before pickup, the dumpster will be quite full!)  Every trip I go on, I find something good.  So in my experience, it is a very good hobby.    Also, last thing, remember your safety first.  Get some cut proof gloves, and have a first aid kit in your car.  If possible, it's also way better to go with someone else rather than solo."
DumpsterDiving,3cnp2s,trmbnplyr1993,4,Thu Jul 9 09:13:49 2015 UTC,"Glad you found all that. Sadly, there once was a time when the office stores actually tossed electronics. Now days its just candy, used ink, a broken chair or two, and maybe some pens if you are lucky."
DumpsterDiving,3cnp2s,Jamesfire,3,Fri Jul 10 05:58:44 2015 UTC,"Yeah, now they have a electronics recycling program so anything electric pretty much gets tossed into a giant bin and gets sent to a recycling warehouse. Same with a lot of the ink. I'm actually very surprised OP found candy/food because when I used to work there, the managers didn't care if it was expired, they always tried to sell it. As far as office chairs, they'll only throw one out if it's a broken floor model. If it still works, they often sell the floor models to the staff for ridiculously low prices ($5-$10). If its not a floor model and it gets damaged or is opened, it gets shipped back to another recycling plant to be destroyed (we called this Code 16 disposal).  Source: Used to work at Staples"

About 3-4 weeks after I started looking in dumpsters, I got my biggest haul ever (still to this day a year and a half later). It was like 500 games in giant stacks (90% or so were Madden 2012/2011 and Sports Champions for PS3. There were also quite a few better games (Killzone 2, Borderlands 2, and a few others I can't think of the name of). Like 4 USB controllers (3 wired and 1 wireless, all work). 3 or 4 xbox 360 headsets, and some other odds and ends (including one of those Portal things like you have, the white disk thing that goes with some game).  A year later and I haven't found a single item from that dumpster. I don't check it much anymore (maybe once every couple weeks) because it's like a 15-20 minute drive and it's the only store out there that has a dumpster I can get to).  Also found an Office Max that I got a nice computer chair out of (it was thrown away because the allen wrench was missing from the package lol)...but it closed like a week later and combined with Office Depot which uses a compactor.  GL in the future, hopefully you keep getting big scores like that."

DumpsterDiving,3cuiut,otterland,446,Fri Jul 10 21:57:33 2015 UTC,"I work in a grocery store. When we find meat that a customer left out in another area we take it back to the meat dept. so the manager can take it off of their inventory. It is put in a designated area of the ""cold room"" until this can be done. If the mgr. is off, the bad meat sits in a box getting cold again until the mgr. comes back to work to mark it off and throws it away. So just because someone finds cold meat in a dumpster,  I wouldn't assume it was still good."

Empirical evidence?   http://www.ext.colostate.edu/pubs/foodnut/09300.html   Food intoxication results from consumption of toxins (or poisons) produced in food by bacterial growth. Toxins, not bacteria, cause illness. Toxins may not alter the appearance, odor or flavor of food. Common kinds of bacteria that produce toxins include Staphylococcus aureus and Clostridium  botulinum.      When Staphylococcus bacteria get into warm food and multiply, they produce a toxin or poison that causes illness. The toxin is not detectable by taste or smell. While the bacteria itself can be killed by temperatures of 120 F, its toxin is heat resistant; therefore, it is important to keep the staph organism from growing.  Foods commonly involved in staphylococcal intoxication include protein foods such as ham, processed meats, tuna, chicken, sandwich fillings, cream fillings, potato and meat salads, custards, milk products and creamed potatoes. Foods that are handled frequently during preparation are prime targets for staphylococci contamination.   Just because you've worked in dirty kitchens and eat out of a dumpster doesn't mean you know what you're talking about.    How about I call you an amateur who's jealous of my mad chicken harvesting skills?   There's the talk of a food scientist who's an expert on food illness with his empirical evidence.

The problem with meats, particularly raw meats, is that it's rather important they're constantly kept at an appropriate temperature (called the cold chain) you have no idea how long that's been in the dumpster, or how long it was out of the fridge before that!  Ever walked around a supermarket and see some asshole has left some meat he didn't want anymore in a non refrigerated part of the supermarket? Are you picking that shit up and buying it? Fuck no!  At the end of the day it's your chicken, your decision... But Salmonella is no fun man."
DumpsterDiving,3cuiut,RedShirtDecoy,-96,Sat Jul 11 07:05:31 2015 UTC,"Read the title again. COLD chicken. It goes straight from the cooler to the dumpster. Ill even grab it if it's cool, not cold, but cook it to temp immediately upon getting home.   Most meat has bacteria on it, ya chicken littles--even that ""sanitary"" stuff you buy in the front of the house. The idea that an hour in a dumpster is going to make it worse is silly. You still need to handle and cook it properly.  I worked in kitchens years ago, sous, grill, and pastry. I saw far far ""worse"" meat handling issues day to day than what ya'll are getting your Hanes in a knot over. Thing is, while letting meat come to room temp might propagate bacteria, fire kills it.  Ultimately the only thing that matters is decomposition. Use your nose. It's usually very obvious if something isn't right.  Meat is one of the most wasteful things to eat on the planet, that's why I feel better if nearly all the animal protein I eat is meat that was on its way to the landfill. It's perfectly good. The dates aren't some science fiction code, just like they aren't on milk. Meat and dairy last several days beyond. They keep the dates short to cover their asses is all.  The fear and outright shitty mean attitudes expressed in the comments baffle me. This isn't my first rodeo. Been diving for many years. Never sick...been plenty sick on restaurant food which I paid good money for."
DumpsterDiving,3cuiut,BillyTheBaller1996,92,Sat Jul 11 14:58:30 2015 UTC,"(tldr at the top now)  tldr: this guy's advice is terrible and dangerous. Don't trust raw meat sitting in a dumpster even if it is ""cold"" and smells ok. you can get very seriously ill. You never know what has happened to the meat and it could be very dangerous.   TLDR2: Toxins (poisons) are produced from bacterial growth. The toxins make you sick (in the case of food intoxication). The bacteria can be killed by heating (cooking) the meat, the toxins cannot be. The toxins may also be odorless and flavorless. OP has no idea what he's talking about.  ...  So the supermarket comes in to find there was a power outage the night before. All their frozen goods de-thawed and it's a huge mess. The power was out all night and the raw chicken that wasn't frozen just sat heating in the summer temps all night building dangerous toxins that aren't ""killed with fire"".   Power came on in the morning but it was obvious from the huge mess of frozen goods that there was an outage. Everything got ""cold"" again, but obviously spoiled.   After cleaning up the mess they toss out their last 18 pounds of raw chicken that was baking in the heat all night (however is now cold again). Luckily /u/otterland happens to by strolling by at this point and finds his awesome score of toxin-laden (toxins you can't cook out) raw dumpster chicken and figures, ""eh, it's probably good, it's just expired today"".   Sure, there's a higher chance it's just expired and you'll be ok because you found it at the right time just out of the fridge, but there's no way to know ever where your raw dumpster chicken came from and why it was thrown away, even if you have worked in a kitchen for years. You don't work at that supermarket, you have no idea.   And it's pretty damn irresponsible of you to go on the internet to a sub about free dumpster stuff and tell everyone that eating chicken that has been sitting raw in a dumpster is perfectly ok and has no drawbacks because of your kitchen experience, and is even good for the planet, etc.   You have no idea where it came from, how long it potentially had been sitting out in the heat acquiring toxins you can't cook out and your nose doesn't detect, or any other huge variety of circumstances where the poultry is not safe even though it is ""cold"" and maybe smells ok.   And some kid reading this is going to think, ""I like free stuff, I like chicken, I like doing good things for the planet"" etc and maybe goes out and finds toxic raw meat that smells ""ok"" and is more or less ""cold"" in a dumpster and gets very seriously ill based on your terrible advice.   The meat industry has a huge amounts of standards and procedures  for a good reason (The Jungle by Upton Sinclair and all that), for safety and health reasons. Just because you got lucky and haven't gotten sick on your raw dumpster meat, and you have worked in some dirty kitchens that skirted health regulations, doesn't mean it's a good idea to advise people online to be digging raw meat out of dumpsters, doing a quick temp and smell check and then assuming everything is all good and you're doing right by the planet. It's a terrible idea and someone will get seriously ill following your advice.   tldr: this guy's advice is terrible and dangerous. Don't trust raw meat sitting in a dumpster even if it is ""cold"" and smells ok. you can get very seriously ill. You never know what has happened to the meat and it could be very dangerous.   Edit:    Read the title again. COLD chicken. It goes straight from the cooler to the dumpster. Ill even grab it if it's cool, not cold   There's absolutely no way this guy knows that. It's a huge assumption and a big risk to take. Again, he doesn't work in that supermarket and doesn't know what has been going on with the raw poultry, he just worked in some dirty kitchens and has been eating from dumpsters for awhile. This by no means makes him any sort of expert on the safety of raw meat, instead he's just some guy telling you things on the internet with lots of assumptions.    And even if it is ""cool"", since supermarkets are air conditioned, for example, it could have been sitting out in the back in a corner for days by accident and still be ""cool"" from the general temperature of the place and still not decomposed enough to really smell that bad, but be very dangerous. Or another million scenarios on how the chicken could be bad and still be cold and smell ok, because nobody knows what has happened to it except the employees. the dude digging it out of the trash outside certainly is not the expert on the safety of the meat.   If you need to save money on food that badly buy a 10 pound bag of rice and beans etc.  /r/budgetfood /r/eatcheapandhealthy /r/frugal etc etc   Edit2 With a source:  TLDR2: Toxins (poisons) are produced from bacterial growth.

While the bacteria itself can be killed by temperatures of 120 F, its toxin is heat resistant; therefore, it is important to keep the staph organism from growing.  Foods commonly involved in staphylococcal intoxication include protein foods such as ham, processed meats, tuna, chicken, sandwich fillings, cream fillings, potato and meat salads, custards, milk products and creamed potatoes. Foods that are handled frequently during preparation are prime targets for staphylococci contamination.   Etc..."

DumpsterDiving,3cuiut,CodyWiedenbein,12,Sat Jul 11 18:09:58 2015 UTC,"OP... Seriously, DO. NOT. EAT. THAT.  You have no idea what the history of that meat is. For all you know, those 18 lbs. of chicken could have been recalled for some reason.  Poultry, as with any other food product, must be stored to have an internal temperature of 41°F or lower. If it has off odors, sliminess, stickiness under the wings, or is discolored, you are likely to get food poisoning. Poultry products support the growth of disease-causing and spoilage microorganisms, including salmonella and campylobacter jejuni. The near neutral pH, among other factors, make it an ideal material for bacteria to grow in and on.   In case you're wondering what the slime is on your chicken, yeah, that's the massive salmonella bacterial colony.  If poultry that contains campylobacter jejuni is consumed, you can expect to start experiencing symptoms in 2-5 days, lasting 2-7 days. You'll have watery, bloody diarrhea.  If poultry that contains salmonella is consumed, you can expect to start experiencing symptoms in 6-48 hours, lasting 2-3 days. You'll have nausea, fever, vomiting, abdominal cramps, and diarrhea.  In the end, you should ask yourself if your health is worth so little as to consume food which is likely to be poisoned. Your call."

Then either throw all the keys into the middle of the crowd or then say the keys are hidden all over the mall. Watch the fun. Rent a couple of those big sumo suits and announce that oh behalf of whatever company, there will be a Sumo competition. Say that Everyone who joins gets a key, only one key opens the door. You only have one opportunity to open the car door, but you may use as many keys as you possess. If you lose a sumo match, you must surrender your keys to the winner. Matches are chosen by luck of the draw. Use either names in a hat or one of those lottery cages withthe pingpong balls.   Then get a thing of Auntie Annie's preztel nuggets with marinara sauce and sit back and enjoy a sumo competition that gets more and more brutal as people become more and more desperate.

Some places even just give you food if you say you're lost/have no wallet, and if you're in a situation where that's true it could work."
DumpsterDiving,3cctt0,NoneStar,2,Wed Jul 8 02:43:05 2015 UTC,Good reform. I wonder if we could network these initiatives with more radical solutions like counter-economies and co-ops.
DumpsterDiving,3cc3t5,ktbhey,14,Mon Jul 6 19:25:30 2015 UTC,"I sent an Email to the company asking them. Don't worry, there are no Aldi locations near 2000 miles of me, so me asking them won't affect your ability to dive the place."
DumpsterDiving,3cc3t5,JosephFurguson,1 point,Mon Jul 6 22:49:54 2015 UTC,any response?
DumpsterDiving,3cc3t5,trollboogies,3,Wed Jul 15 00:41:24 2015 UTC,"No official policy on Dumpster Diving itself.   They follow local and state laws in regards to the practice.   They do throw away food for reasons beyond just expiration dates. (safety recalls.)  Anything that can be donated to local food banks routinely is.   If you ask, the manager for food for a charitable cause, they might be willing to give some (same as Wal-Mart.)"
DumpsterDiving,3cc3t5,JosephFurguson,2,Wed Jul 15 01:38:39 2015 UTC,thanks!
DumpsterDiving,3cc3t5,trollboogies,9,Wed Jul 15 01:42:16 2015 UTC,"One time an Aldi's higher up did an AMA and someone thanked him for all the good food they put in dumpsters. His response was something like ""well we try to donate a lot too, but glad it's not going to waste!"".  (I'm sure the link is out there somewhere but I'm on mobile.)  Obviously that's not official corporate policy, but I think they're pretty okay with it as long as you don't make a mess or be an asshole about it."

DumpsterDiving,3cc3t5,kopedan,2,Wed Jul 8 00:44:06 2015 UTC,"At my local Aldi we go an hour after they close so that anything they have thrown out that day is right on top. I don't like climbing in or local one all that much because of the amount of rotted fruit along the bottom, makes for a pretty big mess. But yeah we just pull up to ours, hop out and lift the lids and take a look for some things on top. We have never had anyone say anything about it but if they did we would tell them sorry and leave."
DumpsterDiving,3cc3t5,brianpepinski,1 point,Mon Jul 6 22:26:27 2015 UTC,Aldi is pretty easy to get stuff from. I've never encountered someone day or night while diving.

Aldi started off being the best place in town to buy groceries, and now the average store around here carries bottom-of-the-barrel produce and cheap, highly-processed packaged foods, not to mention being a very dirty environment (spilled food, ruined packages, cockroaches). I wish Aldi Süd cared enough to straighten up their stores here, but they seem content to let them decline and shut down instead. Oh well, off to Trader Joe's (Aldi Nord)!"
DumpsterDiving,3c95lk,TheWiredWorld,2,Mon Jul 6 14:53:18 2015 UTC,Oh wow that's really bad! I'm sorry your aldi is like that! The one around my home is much much cleaner than all of the other chain grocery stores around and has great produce.

DumpsterDiving,3c9fx7,Meziroth,2,Mon Jul 6 06:05:20 2015 UTC,"Edit: OP are they T12 or t8? Check the side of the bulb, then consider my writeup below.   I sell lights.  Those are T12 bulbs. They stopped production in 2012, and their ballasts were stopped in 2010. They use an offensive amount of electricity compared to the newer, thinner T8s (40% more). Additionally, you can't put these into a T8 fixture (they fit but won't work), or vice versa.   These are junk. They are only expensive in box stores because they are no longer used. They are pretty bad for the environment as well. Please consider throwing them out.   Next:  Throwing these out (you're losing money by keeping them) is a pain, and legally they aren't allowed in dumpsters because of the mercury. Just an FYI."
DumpsterDiving,3c9fx7,JustAHerpDerp,2,Mon Jul 6 17:31:42 2015 UTC,They are t8's.
DumpsterDiving,3c9fx7,Meziroth,2,Mon Jul 6 18:38:52 2015 UTC,I have reported several companies that have these lights in their dumpsters. These need to be recycled correctly.

DumpsterDiving,3c9fx7,Meziroth,1 point,Mon Jul 6 20:39:03 2015 UTC,They are better than the cheap t5 or LEDisease replacements. The lower wattage preheat (14-20 are pretty good to use on tubes t8-12. I have a few of the preheat strips with aforementioned ballasts installed running f17t8 octrons. They are pretty bright and they work considerably better than on appropriate rapid start ballasts.

DumpsterDiving,3c6hvh,jack_lax,7,Sun Jul 5 08:12:08 2015 UTC,"Do not, by any means, speak to a store employee or manager about it.  People have awesome finds because stores are lazy about destroying the goods.  Usually, in order to get compensated for merchandise from the manufacturer or write it off on taxes a store has to render the goods unusable but it's much easier to just throw it in the dumpster and call it a day.  If they know someone is going through the dumpster then they will most likely start destroying it and make it harder on you."
DumpsterDiving,3c6hvh,sir_richard_head,3,Mon Jul 6 19:01:17 2015 UTC,"I would honestly rather just dig through the dumpster. It kinda takes the romance out of it if you just go pick it up from an employee. Also, I promise that's against their policy."
DumpsterDiving,3c6hvh,derkman96,2,Sun Jul 5 09:34:41 2015 UTC,"90% of the time it won't happen, let me tell you that asking doesn't always get it for you, I asked about a poster once and they tossed it on me, I did manage to get one from another location though so I was still happy"
DumpsterDiving,3c6hvh,mattd121794,1 point,Sun Jul 5 13:26:55 2015 UTC,"If you let the employees in on any idea of what you would be trying to do, they might start watching or making sure they actually destroy stuff before putting things in that dumpster. Sometimes you can ask them to hold or if they would be willing to give you""promotional"" items , ask if you can come to pick them up, and there was a guy who had luck with that and got a full xbox 360 demo playstation. Other than that though, it's best not to ask."
DumpsterDiving,3c6hvh,VeganMinecraft,1 point,Sun Jul 5 14:53:42 2015 UTC,I agree with what everyone else has said. Most places wont hold stuff for you or will even go so far as to start destroying things if they find out you are diving their bins. That being said i have heard tales from other divers that said that some gamestop managers will hold specific promotional signs and displays if you ask bit just signage and displays. But personally id rather just dive for it. Always remember 100 empty dumpsters makes the one good find feel like finding porate treasure. :) hope this helps!
DumpsterDiving,3c3hnx,BoringNormalGuy,32,Sat Jul 4 12:06:45 2015 UTC,"Carpenter here.  If someone were to sneak onto my jobsite after hours and took stuff from my dumpster, I would be happy.  You would be saving me money.    If, however, you ask if you can take things from the dumpster, they may well be obligated to tell you no, because if they say yes, they would be incurring liability if you were to get hurt while grabbing all the construction debris goodies.  They might let you, but they probably shouldn't, legally speaking.    As long as nobody is living in any part of that house, just hop your fence on a Sunday evening and go to town...

Joke staus:  fail  That said, I do know people who have a strong urge to save... stuff.  To save it from going to waste, to save things which have family memories attached to them from getting thrown out, to save things so they can be recycled, etc.  The results are mixed, and not all of these people are having big problems with this.. some just have a lot of shit laying around their properties, some are in worse shape and you have to kind of 'crab-walk' through their apartments for all the junk stacked up, and some are attending Clutterers Annonymous meetings.  Yes, that's a thing.. and if you've ever seen ""Hoarders"" the TV show, you'll know why.    And this can obviously be a huge strain on marriages.

DumpsterDiving,3c0qwd,VeganMinecraft,4,Fri Jul 3 18:36:33 2015 UTC,"Soldering and electrical repair is one of the most useful things you can learn. Just a couple weeks ago my musician friend came to me with a nice electric keyboard (worth ~$400) that his work was just going to trash because the power jack had broken. I ran to Fry's, grabbed about $9 in parts, popped the guy open and replaced the power jack (I also had to place a new tip on the AC adapter since the selection of power jacks at Fry's is horrible) and we were in business. Under $10 in parts and thirty minutes of time and now we've got a nice weighted-key keyboard that I can play around on and he can use for playing shows.  You can get a decent soldering starter kit for $20. It's definitely worth it."
DumpsterDiving,3c0qwd,MagnaFarce,2,Sat Jul 4 23:29:13 2015 UTC,very smart. I would have loved to do that with a keyboard my dad found in a storage unit. It's actually nicer than mine. I'm not sure what they did with it. Probably got trashed. I will definitely be trying to look at how to repair things now. I feel like I could have saved it possibly. Do you have any soldering or electrical videos you might recommend for a complete noob?
DumpsterDiving,3c0qwd,MagnaFarce,1 point,Sat Jul 4 23:49:21 2015 UTC,"There aren't any videos that come immediately to mind. I would always look up specific jobs as they came along, so I don't know any general soldering videos. After you do a few projects you start to get an idea of how things work, though.  I started by tinkering around with an old Atari Video Pinball console I found at the flea market. Game consoles from the early '80s to early '90s are good for practicing on because they're not too complex and are readily available. It's a gradual process, learning how to solder and diagnose problems.  Most of the time it's a problem with the voltage regulator or with the capacitors. I would get some pieces of cheap electronics (early '80s-'90s game consoles are readily available and aren't too complex inside) and just try to replace those parts. You will likely have to look around on various forums or do google/youtube searches to find the information you need.  I hope this was helpful. I just got back from a July 4th shindig and have had several drinks, so if this doesn't make sense or sounds rambley let me know and I can reply again tomorrow when I'm sober."

If you go persistently, then you're sure to find great stuff in a lot of the more common spots.  As for legality, I've only been stopped a couple of times by police.  Middletown Township gave me the go ahead, acknowledging the grey area.  Abington Township, in Mont. co. told me that diving there was a no-go and to move along.    I've only run into other divers once or twice, and generally I'll make way for folks who need the food more than I.    If there's anything else you need help with let me know.

DumpsterDiving,3bmxny,crustybreadneck,8,Tue Jul 7 14:58:58 2015 UTC,"My advice is to go for it. Very rarely are you going to get the cops called on you, and if you do it is rare that they will do anything more than tell you to leave. Just be smart; don't carry anything illegal, bring the bare minimum(bag, knife, headlamp, gloves), and be considerate by leaving the place better than you found it. Businesses throw things away because management sees it as a loss of profits and a liability to donate. Going through their trash is subverting the problems that all parties have, and can be beneficial to both of you. Also, once you establish history of diving a particular area, it is easier to talk your way out of harassment."

DumpsterDiving,3bmxny,VeganMinecraft,2,Tue Jun 30 15:27:47 2015 UTC,"Go after 10 pm if  you are worried about being seen. Most people in the stores have left by then. If you get caught by ""ordinary people"" just say you are looking for boxes because you are moving, and most people will carry on. Listen to music while you are doing it if you are still nervous.  If you are stopped by cops, and they seem cool you can tell them what you are doing, show them pictures maybe of some of the stuff you found, and if you found anything cool already, show it to them, maybe offer them something, tell them why you are doing it, and it could end up perfectly fine. Mostly it's just illegal if it's on private property. And worst case is a cop will ask you to leave and then you just leave and move on to elsewhere."

DumpsterDiving,3bljmv,ued222,3,Tue Jun 30 05:03:01 2015 UTC,This post is really confusing to me. Are you using receipts that you dumpster dived for or?
DumpsterDiving,3bljmv,eventually_i_will,1 point,Tue Jun 30 07:07:47 2015 UTC,I'm guessing they're using promos and coupons found on packaging. For example I often buy granola bars that have cut-out coupons on the box for free milk.
DumpsterDiving,3bljmv,alittlekink,-1,Tue Jun 30 07:46:56 2015 UTC,I hope not because that's why businesses destroy products.
DumpsterDiving,3bljmv,TheMegaBenson,5,Tue Jun 30 14:20:29 2015 UTC,"That is not why businesses destroy products. Businesses destroy products because they can get full reimbursement from a company for products that aren't selling, have small defects/whatever, if they field destroy them. Companies get ""credit"" for destroying them, as wasteful as it is. They don't see the money in knocking prices down a whole lot for items, so they'd rather destroy them and get money back from the company. They may also not want to bother with the cost to send them back to the manufacturer so they destroy them.  It has nothing to do with receipts that could be left in the trash from anybody. Don't take your receipt when the cashier asks? Where do you think your copy goes? Plenty of folks over in /r/beermoney who are cashiers do this very thing where they make bank by snapping the receipts of people who didn't want theirs and getting cashback, discounts, credit or content. The receipts that got thrown away could have been used by the original buyer on the same app to get rebates, discounts, coupons, or content. But likely they don't know or care about the hidden money in receipts, so instead someone else came across that receipt and was able to get that rebate, discount or what have you for themselves."

Like others said, you might want to elaborate on what you are saying because it's not very clear to people who have no idea of these apps or the hidden money and content in receipts."

DumpsterDiving,3biwfw,RRRRRK,4,Mon Jun 29 16:26:57 2015 UTC,That is super awesome! Such a charitable person! I too and getting so much stuff from dumpster diving I rather don't know what to do with it. Currently it's mostly whiteboards (like 8 of them!) and home products so maybe I'll just go around my campus and set up my own little free store for a day.
DumpsterDiving,3biwfw,VeganMinecraft,3,Mon Jun 29 22:18:05 2015 UTC,Man I want to do it so bad where I live but I'm scared...ugh. I live right next to a VERY busy grocery store.
DumpsterDiving,3biwfw,TheWiredWorld,2,Tue Jun 30 14:41:27 2015 UTC,"I understand the feeling! I'd be scared too. It's not something a lot of society does and you don't want to be seen as a weirdo, unstable, smelly, or dirty. By dumpster diving I was actually saying for me it was more ""trashroom"" exploring. I was too nervous to go out into actual dumpsters myself during move out when everyone and their mother is around, so I just went around to our floor trashrooms and scavenged. Now I've got a new wireless printer and let someone have my old one, a new vaccum, travel kit, donated a huge box of ramen, big pillow, makeup kit, fish tank (one of my happiest finds as I have 2 fish!).  I'd say start with something that you think you'd feel comfortable doing and pick times a lot later at night when almost no one will be out."

What is she supposed to do? Go to the store and buy them hundreds of dollars of the same food when she already does and COULD get it for free? The lack of action by the government or society to help the poor people and the fact that it is often up to individuals is what is most sad about this piece. Most people have no problems with food when dumpster diving, you just have to be smart about it, and if you are hungry, you really aren't going to care."

If I have a few gift cards that only have a few dollars or cents, is it possible to transfer the balance on to just one card to have one card with ~15 dollars?"
DumpsterDiving,3bj09r,Navi401,8,Mon Jun 29 17:50:15 2015 UTC,"Depending on the state, you may be able to redeem them for cash.  For example, in my state of California, state law stipulates that a merchant must convert a gift card into cash if the balance is less than $10."

DumpsterDiving,3bj09r,cops-and-queers,2,Sat Jul 4 02:41:49 2015 UTC,"Most chains will consolidate cards. My experience is that this is where cards get tossed and still retain a balance. Some places, like Regal cinemas (at least near me) won't allow employees to discard them. Often they're just adding the Vaud up and making a new card with the total. The old partial cards should be cleared out, but someone's aren't."
DumpsterDiving,3bj09r,Ubelaffe,1 point,Mon Jun 29 23:17:00 2015 UTC,"Just go to the place in which you have the gifts for and purchase a $15 gift card.  Then, use all the smaller gifts towards the purchase of the single gift card. Cards consolidated!"

DumpsterDiving,3bj09r,Navi401,3,Sun Jul 5 13:13:59 2015 UTC,"They might get suspicious, but I don't think there is much they could do about it. A giftcard is like a bearer bond: the person that holds it, owns it. The only risk I could think of is that if the cards were stolen. Can you maybe e-mail a few different stores like ten card numbers at a time? Ten isn't a highly suspicious amount to me and if you spread it out over a few stores I think you'd fly under the radar."
DumpsterDiving,3bj09r,trugrit03,3,Tue Jun 30 02:01:27 2015 UTC,"That's not right. Normally a gift card in the store has no value on it until purchased. When purchased it leaves the store typically. If a store is tossing gift cards, they're probably blank. If a person is tossing gift cards they're probably stolen."

DumpsterDiving,3be2kj,TheWiredWorld,3,Mon Jun 29 02:13:01 2015 UTC,Unless they had mold/mildew they could have offered to charity and still got the write off that way.
DumpsterDiving,3be2kj,Svx_blue,4,Sun Jun 28 16:06:24 2015 UTC,"Loss would also mean destroyed merchandise so not quite the same. You see this in books too if you ever see books with their cover torn off. The merchandise has been recorded as ""destroyed"" and they were almost certainly required to.  They don't get any tax write off for tossing merch, to ""write something off"" is just a phrase."
DumpsterDiving,3be2kj,kateh01,1 point,Sun Jun 28 17:24:09 2015 UTC,I used to frequent a an open air flea market that had two or three vendors that sold only books without covers. There is a name for it that escapes me right now. Cheap way to get your read on

Could have given it away with other pre order stuff, sold to off price retailers our given away to charity which there is tax incentives for. Sure,  pennies on the dollar but the would have made more than distroying and tossing them."
DumpsterDiving,3be2kj,Svx_blue,5,Sun Jun 28 19:24:58 2015 UTC,"You might have seen it elsewhere, but they destroy it like this so they can be paid back fully.  I don't agree with it either but it's a very ingrained system at this point."
DumpsterDiving,3be2kj,kateh01,0,Sun Jun 28 19:28:34 2015 UTC,I think /u/Svx_blue meant they could have written it off as a charitable donation.
DumpsterDiving,3be2kj,KetchupKakes,0,Mon Jun 29 19:44:27 2015 UTC,"I know, which was a misunderstanding of what SpartanMonkey was saying, which is that GameStop would write the slashed t-shirts off as a loss."
DumpsterDiving,3be2kj,kateh01,10,Mon Jun 29 19:48:17 2015 UTC,"Most corporately owned businesses make destroying items that are no longer being sold (for whatever reason) part of standard practice to deter internal theft. For example, if Ricky Employee knows that an item will be thrown away and written off for any little thing that makes in unsaleable (damaged packaging, missing pieces, slight but repairable damage), and he knows that the item will be simply placed in the dumpster outside, he is more likely to ""accidentally"" damage things he might want so that he can later retrieve them from the dumpster. HOWEVER, if the items being discarded/written off are irreparably ruined (such as in the case of these t-shirts), there is no incentive to this kind of theft.   This practice is systemic in big retail. Examples in my direct experience include:  - Picture frames and broken canvases (for painting) slashed and broken into pieces (Michael's Arts & Crafts) - An entire 53' storage container full of summer-themed wicker baskets still in their original manufacturers case packs crushed in a compactor (Michael's Arts & Crafts). There was nothing at all wrong with them, only that the season had passed and they were discontinued.  - Fourteen lawn and leaf bags of yarn compacted (Mike's again).  - Untold hundreds of pounds of dog, cat and other animal kibbles and dry foods mixed with bleach before being put in the dumpster (PetSmart).  - Pet toys, clothes, beds and accessories all slashed, broken or otherwise destroyed beyond use before being discarded (PetSmart).   I thought I had more, but I suppose that's it. Stick around long enough and you'll see a parade of office chairs that have been slashed up, too. And, well, these shirts.   In the case of the dog food especially, folks often ask ""Why not donate it to shelters/rescues that genuinely need these things - especially company's like PSmart that works directly with local rescues to home animals?"" Because they don't want to get sued. If Rescue Mutt gets sick and dies because he was eating donated food from PetSmart, it suddenly becomes PetSmart's fault. How could they give away bad food like that? Don't they know better?   It's all about profit. There's no profit in giving things away."

I've worked in home depot and we'd be forced to dump tool sets (and just about any item  we sold) cause one tiny piece was missing or was returned for whatever reason.   I hated doing it, but my mgr would say well get credit for it.  They would make less donating it or selling it at a reduced cost. You think gamestop wants to sell shirts for a penny? When they know they'll get a full refund from the company? It sucks and is wasteful, but big company's look at the big dollar sign not the little ones (even if it's unethical or stupid)"

DumpsterDiving,3be1ze,whocareswhatever,2,Mon Jun 29 04:31:06 2015 UTC,I figured they probably didn't really 'expire' I have yet to taste them to see if I taste a difference.
DumpsterDiving,3be1ze,kopedan,2,Mon Jun 29 05:56:41 2015 UTC,"I passed on cases of that stuff on my last Staples dive, I got a lot of food & coffee but it's all expired by 3 months at least. Still eating it, but is that normal for Staples to wait so long?"
DumpsterDiving,3be1ze,ayek8,3,Sun Jun 28 18:13:42 2015 UTC,"I used to work at Staples, and what we do is mark that stuff WAYYY down. Employees get first dibs, and the rest is put in a bin near the front of the store marked down as expired. We leave it there for quite some time and once it hits 2-3months expired, we toss it."
DumpsterDiving,3be1ze,Staciex327,2,Sat Jul 4 09:47:00 2015 UTC,I've always been curious about this. Thanks for sharing!

DumpsterDiving,3bc2o1,Ubelaffe,7,Sat Jun 27 20:10:39 2015 UTC,"I don't have a car, so I'm limited to non-interstate roads, but I've managed to find quite a few goodies. Lots of tools, ratchet straps, various random objects, a $20 bill once. Toys are my favorite. Here's a random duck I picked up while bike touring. My father has also picked up a really nice fiberglass ladder after driving past it every day for a week.   Waterways are similarly full of stuff. I never have to buy toys for my dog anymore. Every time I paddle down the local bayou, I grab a few balls to take home. There's a local group that cleans waterways, and they once came out with an entire canoe full of balls. (seriously)  Also, since I live in the south, the road shoulders are often covered with sugarcane. I'll pick up the occasional fresh pieces to suck on sometimes. Even cooler is when there are pecan trees on the side of the road and I'll get a free snack."
DumpsterDiving,3bc2o1,Lady_Bernkastel,4,Sat Jun 27 22:15:10 2015 UTC,Lol. That duck is awesome.

Turns out that picking up debris off the side of a freeway is not a good idea mostly because shit can go pear shape in a hurry. Also, I was a needless distraction from the Patrol offices from real crimes and real dangers.   However, I've picked up stuff from country roads, highways, and the like for years without incident. The roads down here in the desert have so little traffic on them that if I get hit by a vehicle I deserved it."

I mean, even I do this at home with meat that has gone long passed its life. I put it in the freezer and toss it on garbage day  You just got some meat that was likely sitting on a shelf someone left there or some boxes that were never put into the fridge section...that is why its still ""cold""   I mean yeah, its all good (given your update) but man...that is literally NOT worth it unless you are destitute."
DumpsterDiving,3b8lxs,3rdLevelRogue,13,Sun Jul 12 02:10:24 2015 UTC,Welcome to the world of never having room in your freezer for shit. My freezer has been fully packed for so long at this point that I just began to donate stuff a couple days ago to a homeless shelter (only shelter for men in a huge radius) so I could have some ice cube trays. The guy gave me a weird look when I dropped off about 15lbs of hamburger and I just shrugged and told him my fridge was on the fritz and I didn't want it to go to waste. I'm hoping the few guys I saw lingering in the parking lot waiting for meals got fed some good stuff.
DumpsterDiving,3b8lxs,badrussiandriver,5,Fri Jun 26 22:14:27 2015 UTC,If you have the space you can get a big chest freezer for around 100 bucks off craigslist
DumpsterDiving,3b8lxs,arbivark,6,Fri Jun 26 22:55:49 2015 UTC,"I don't really have the space and the place I dive tosses out meat and stuff either every night or every other night, so I can refill pretty often. I just feel bad seeing it all go to waste when it could go to a soup kitchen or something, so I try to freeze it and donate it. I'm not sure if that's a good thing to do or not though."
DumpsterDiving,3b8lxs,DonPoppito666,2,Sat Jun 27 02:33:27 2015 UTC,OMG I didn't even think to look on Craigslist! I FREAKING LOVE YOU!!
DumpsterDiving,3b8lxs,funchy,2,Sat Jun 27 11:21:37 2015 UTC,i got my chest freezer off craiglist's free section. it's usually full of dumpstered stuff.
DumpsterDiving,3b8lxs,Numinak,13,Tue Jun 30 03:48:33 2015 UTC,"From Target?  Something is probably wrong with it.  The only reason we would throw that out is if it was out of temp for too long, otherwise it would have been donated.  Someone probably left it out of the freezer too long, then put it back and re-froze it before someone told them to toss it."
DumpsterDiving,3b8lxs,ldbc12,4,Sat Jun 27 05:48:45 2015 UTC,I can't help but wonder why they had to throw this out?   It's not expired and the packaging appears ok.   Perhaps it was stored improperly?   Be careful on meat products.
DumpsterDiving,3b8lxs,micuss,2,Sat Jun 27 01:43:36 2015 UTC,Likely some store credit issue or command from on high to replace them with different products.

DumpsterDiving,3atyfc,ediblesprysky,4,Tue Jun 23 14:13:57 2015 UTC,"Have you ever had a confrontation with other people (who weren't cops or store employees) while diving, and if so, what happened?   The other divers in my area tend to be former and current heroin users and they tend to get stabby angry, if you catch my meaning.    What kind of precautions do you take to make sure you're safe?   Well, I tend to know my limits. Unless I can carry it home, I leave it behind.   What time of day do you think is the safest?   There's no time that 100 percent safe. You just need to go when you feel comfortable.    What's the best piece of advice you can give me that I haven't even thought to ask for?    Go to Harbor Freight and buy the following: Disposable Gloves, 1 or 2 of their cheap flashlights, head lamp, and their a grabber. This should cost you 20.00 dollars at retail, but every item on this list is always on sale.   Bring a knife with you. For some reason, a folding knife is less suspicious than box cutters.  Wear clothes you no longer care about. Long Sleeve is best.  If you want clothes, you are better off going to apartments and thrift stores than big box stores. Big Stores tend to destroy their product before trowing it into the skip."
DumpsterDiving,3atyfc,JosephFurguson,3,Tue Jun 23 19:49:41 2015 UTC,"I forget how I was inspired but I've been diving since Nov '14. I normally Day-Time dive, no one cares. Unlike many fellow divers, I do not dive for edibles. I wear gloves as my safety precaution. Advice? Avoid compactors besides a waste of time, HELLA dangerous."
DumpsterDiving,3atyfc,CanDoBlue,2,Tue Jun 23 18:03:49 2015 UTC,"I was also inspired by Just Eat It - great to see others following the same path!  I'm an average sized man and I live in a relatively safe, suburban area, so I am pretty comfortable looking around behind stores at night. It's easy to dumpster dive during the day, too, though. If I were you, I'd make a list of small-ish grocery stores (Aldi, Trader Joe's, etc) near your home and just go scout them out in the middle of the day. Figure out which ones have dumpsters that are easily accessible and unlocked. You can choose to take a look inside a few of them if there are no employees around, but you should be quick about it if you go during store open hours. You don't want some overzealous employee to put a lock on the dumpster because he/she saw you poking around in there.  Once you have your area scouted out, try getting up at the crack of dawn (5:00 am or so) and hitting all the dumpsters. Take notes on when they are emptied. Look out for garbage trucks if you go on a weekday. This way it'll be mostly deserted but still light out and you'll have some traffic around the streets so you won't feel so alone.  Once you get comfortable with that, try checking it out at night - ~1 hr after stores close is a good time. Just drive by and see if the lights are off and the employees' cars are gone. Does it feel safe? Go look in the dumpster. Are there sketchy people wandering around? Drive on. Eventually you will learn what the best times are for your area.  I've never been stopped at a dumpster either by employees, cops, other divers, or homeless people. I think just by figuring out a good schedule you can pretty much avoid all these encounters. I have only been doing this for a few months, though, so it's possible that I've just been lucky!  Hope that helps."

What kind of precautions do you take to make sure you're safe? I wear long pants (my work pants have built in knee pads, this is a huuuuge plus) Always wear thick gloves because of glass, razors, needles, etc who knows!  What time of day do you think is the safest? Safest as of what? Raccoons? go during the day. I usually go during the day because I find it to be that people dont care anyways. You look more suspicious when divin at night IMO  What's the best piece of advice you can give me that I haven't even thought to ask for? Sometimes places you wouldnt think to go are the best ones.

DumpsterDiving,3asnw2,Huw2k8,7,Tue Jun 23 04:47:55 2015 UTC,"Big stores are really hard, you have to know the area pretty well and it can take some time. I suggest trying some urban scavenging first off. That being said, it's usually pretty universal that the bins are either in the back alleyway or, uncommonly, collection is put curbside 10pm+ on collection night(we have some buisnesses that do that here because of how cramped some of the older locations are).  That being said, you'll find more success if you go to more outskirts big box stores, as they tend to be more lax(in my experience)."
DumpsterDiving,3asnw2,Nymall,3,Tue Jun 23 05:50:11 2015 UTC,"Just keep scouting you'll find something. You'll find certain dumpters that are very consistent are more consistent than others. What are you looking for? I mainly go to pizza places, grocery stores, and bakeries."

Major department stores often use compressors, sadly. Petco/Pets mart is good if you have pets.   I've had the coolest finds from dumpsters that are easily accessible to the public, e.g. visible from a parking lot. People will go and use these dumpsters and throw away lots of cool shit.   I also have a specs near me that throws out liquor without breaking the bottles sometimes, but from what I've read this is really rare."

DumpsterDiving,3aenzs,Swayhaven,11,Fri Jun 19 15:23:10 2015 UTC,my friend was actually attacked by a homeless man while out diving. Which is why I always bring a gun with me when I go.

DumpsterDiving,3aenzs,Mckee92,0,Fri Jun 19 23:16:50 2015 UTC,"Edit: Just to be clear, this is not an anti-gun rant.  Until this week (I hope) I was homeless`for a few years and dumpster dived for a living. Actually still do for my living.   Not a smart move to think you can scare me with a gun. I can only imagine why some random homeless guy tried to ""attack"" your friend... Most probable best case scenario is that it wasn't strictly your friends fault. Just ignorance combined with fear coupled with an attempt to bluster as if courageous. Yeah, like your gun, I can totally see that going smoothly.. /s  Bottom line is that if you need a gun to alleviate your fear, yet don't intend to actually use it, that makes you more dangerous than any criminal on the street, who wouldn't hesitate to use a gun, without even trying. Don't think I'm exaggerating either, I live this life day in and day out."
DumpsterDiving,3aenzs,mywan,8,Sat Jun 20 04:27:03 2015 UTC,how exactly does that make me (someone who doesn't want to shoot you) more dangerous than someone who does want to shoot you?  I don't see absolutely any logic in this.
DumpsterDiving,3aenzs,stealer0517,2,Sat Jun 20 04:31:19 2015 UTC,Never carry a gun unless you are prepared to kill someone. Guns are NOT for show.
DumpsterDiving,3aenzs,Daffodils28,-3,Sat Jun 20 07:35:54 2015 UTC,"That is such bullshit. There is a massive amount of unofficially reported crime prevention, simply by brandishing."
DumpsterDiving,3aenzs,TheWiredWorld,2,Sat Jun 20 13:04:17 2015 UTC,"First off criminals (which are quiet rare to begin with) don't want to shoot strangers, and the exceptions are so rare your better off worrying about meteors. They are also not generally subject to acting out on fear alone. A head node and the interaction is over.  On the other hand you take some average Joe who carries a gun explicitly to pacify their fear, then in the moment it's not very effective at actually pacifying that fear. That fear then induces a form of tunnel vision that turns every inane action into an adrenaline rush. Even highly trained people are subject to this tunnel vision in the heat of an adrenaline rush. Someone who carries a gun as a pacifier has no chance.  Add to this the fact that this scared person with a gun is explicitly trying to induce fear in a person who doesn't scare easily, and can read them (even with a gun in their face) better than this scared person can read someone on their best day."

Feel free to take surplus home seems to be the general attitude down there. The laws are more concerned with sanitation and not making larger problems for the cities.   You really need to consult locals divers to find the specifics about your particular city. Canberra has different concerns than Tazmania, and Sidney takes a different view on it than Adelaide.

Things like lawn mowers, snow blowers, and other yard appliances, bicycles, etc are hot items and someone could drop one off and 5 minutes later someone is loading it back up.

The fact that you find food waste at Wal-Mart's and Food Lion's dumpsters isn't the corporation's fault. They have to programs in place to prevent that from happening. The are numerous facets to the food waste problem in this country.    Managers who don't follow the corporation policies about food waste. Some managers don't give a shit and chuck it out every day. Food banks not having enough space. My local food bank would love to get everything they can from stores, but cannot simply because the facility isn't big enough.    There's also one thing that most people don't do that's more effective than they realize. Ask the manager of the store. Tell them about the local food bank services.

DumpsterDiving,39wx1v,Lady_Bernkastel,3,Mon Jun 15 16:01:43 2015 UTC,"Awesome. I've never had any luck on LCDs, but people in my area throw away a LOT of working DLP sets, usually just needing a $20-30 bulb. I picked up a 46 inch samsung a couple months ago and gave it to my father, since he was still using an ancient CRT in his bedroom. Ended up being a nice upgrade for $27 (cost of a new bulb.)  By the way, if you pick one up and it doesn't work, there's a giant fresnel lens immediately behind the screen. It makes an awesome solar death ray. You can melt metal with them."
DumpsterDiving,39wx1v,S3DTinyTurnips,3,Mon Jun 15 21:49:36 2015 UTC,"I curbed my DLP a year ago.  Had it for close to ten years, and the reason I curbed it was because the bulbs were no longer made by Toshiba.  The only replacements were some third party shit ones.  Bulbs were not enclosed completely so when they blew, your internals would be covered in broken glass.  These shit bulbs lasted at most 60 days.  I had many returns to Amazon and replacements sent.  Got real annoying after six months and four replacements with many days of down time waiting on bulb replacements to come in the mail."
DumpsterDiving,39wx1v,Lady_Bernkastel,1 point,Mon Jun 15 22:36:43 2015 UTC,"Wow, that's crazy. I've had a Dell DLP projector for at least five years now, and it's still on the original bulb. It doesn't get used a whole lot, but there were something like 1200 hours on it last I checked. Whatever bulbs you were buying for your TV must have been underspecced for that set. Wouldn't surprise me given the shoddy quality of some generic components."
DumpsterDiving,39wx1v,S3DTinyTurnips,1 point,Tue Jun 16 07:29:52 2015 UTC,"Yeah, they were definitely shit.  Toshiba stopped making my models bulb, so I was SOL.  I tried many different bulbs and eventually had to chuck it.  I replaced it with a 55 inch Vizio.  But man do I miss the Side mounted speakers and look of a DLP."
DumpsterDiving,39wx1v,BigBear1107,1 point,Tue Jun 16 13:00:08 2015 UTC,What is this lens you speak of. Will it really melt metal?!
DumpsterDiving,39wx1v,Lady_Bernkastel,1 point,Mon Jun 15 23:56:30 2015 UTC,"It's a fresnel lens. There's a very large one as the rearmost layer of the screen on DLP TV sets. Yes, it will melt many metals.  Basically, you can think of it like using a magnifying lens to burn stuff. Except instead of being 5cm diameter, it's the size of the TV screen. It's a very awesome project if you ever feel like doing it. Just be very careful and wear eye protection. That thing will instantly set anything near its focal point on fire. Definitely don't use it anywhere near young children or animals, and treat it with the same respect you would an acetylene torch."
DumpsterDiving,39wx1v,autowikibot,1 point,Tue Jun 16 07:23:37 2015 UTC,"Fresnel lens:       A Fresnel lens (pronounced /freɪˈnɛl/ fray-NEL_ or /ˈfrɛznəl/ __FREZ_-nel) is a type of compact lens originally developed by French physicist Augustin-Jean Fresnel for lighthouses.   The design allows the construction of lenses of large aperture and short focal length without the mass and volume of material that would be required by a lens of conventional design. A Fresnel lens can be made much thinner than a comparable conventional lens, in some cases taking the form of a flat sheet. A Fresnel lens can capture more oblique light from a light source, thus allowing the light from a lighthouse equipped with one to be visible over greater distances.

In other words, the gates are probably there for a reason, too.  However, I've still checked out a few areas like this and haven't had any issues.  If you need some extra peace of mind, look up your local area's laws regarding dumpster diving, to get a base understanding of whether diving in general is illegal or not."
DumpsterDiving,39b2bg,akavino,2,Wed Jun 10 16:38:04 2015 UTC,"Fences are definitely a grey area. If they're unlocked, I personally consider them fair game - on the off chance that a cop comes by, it's easy to say ""I'm sorry sir, I thought that because it was unlocked it would be okay to take a look. I'll move along now.""  If they're locked, it's a no-go."
DumpsterDiving,39b2bg,MajesticVelcro,1 point,Wed Jun 10 18:04:26 2015 UTC,"It depends entirely on state and local laws.  Even the locked/unlocked thing is dependent on local laws.  There are many states where dumpster diving is illegal even if the dumpster is in a wide open area just at the side of the road.  Google the laws in regards to your city/county/state and you may want to print out anything that comes up to have on hand in case you get stopped.   Always remember, though, that when you are on private property if you are asked to leave you should comply."
DumpsterDiving,39b2bg,sir_richard_head,1 point,Wed Jun 10 16:35:22 2015 UTC,I thought it was a grey area.  I have avoided them so far but alot of the good places have fences around them

DumpsterDiving,393m34,jenkinsonfire,6,Tue Jun 9 00:42:33 2015 UTC,"Just make sure you can identify why it was thrown out, and work from there. The things I pick are thrown out for one of three reasons:     One thing in the bag has gone bad. (i.e. a bag of apples, one has some mold or has been crushed but the rest are perfectly fine) The printed expiration date has passed.  In this case, it's generally always still good for at least a day or two, but you should use your best judgement.  Something in the case has broken. A case of beer, but one has broken open. Just last night I grabbed 5 things of applesauce, because the sixth in the pack had broken open and they couldn't sell the others.    If it isn't expired and nothing is wrong with it, you'll want to look online for possible recalls because that can be fishy.  But most of the time, if you can identify exactly why it was thrown out you can determine from there if it's safe to eat."
DumpsterDiving,393m34,MajesticVelcro,2,Tue Jun 9 01:07:20 2015 UTC,"Other reason for throwing food out is they don't have enough space, i.e. They order too many bananas and so throw the older (perfectly fine) ones out.   Another thing to note is that bruised produce is usually still consumable. Unless the whole thing is destroyed, you can just eat around/cut out the bad bIt. I make jams and chutneys with fruit that has particularly heavy bruising."
DumpsterDiving,393m34,blanky1,1 point,Tue Jun 9 19:59:09 2015 UTC,"I've always wondered, what exactly is chutney?"
DumpsterDiving,393m34,Aladayle,1 point,Mon Jun 15 05:47:35 2015 UTC,"The way you make it is essentially the same as jam, but has a higher acid content (usually vinegar). I suppose it's almost like a savoury jam - although they're usually still a bit sweet."
DumpsterDiving,393m34,blanky1,2,Mon Jun 15 06:02:37 2015 UTC,Yes to everything thats been sugested the only thing i would like to add is about meats and dairy products. For dairy if the item is not still cold i generally leave it behind but you can generally tell by smell if its still good. For meat if its not frozen or literally just thrown in the trash i dont even touch it. Thats just my two cents.
DumpsterDiving,393m34,charverine,1 point,Tue Jun 9 20:47:56 2015 UTC,"Fresh things can be a challenge, the 'defects' are often cosmetic so they might be a little ugly. So for loose produce I go with things with no obvious mold or decay that I'm confident I can clean. For fresh stuff in containers, bulging (producing gas) or anything that looks obviously off (funny color/moldy/slimy) are a no go. Any dry product in a sealed package is almost certainly still good, though potentially a little stale. Huge hauls of dry goods are good to check against recalls. This guide to expiration dates could be helpful. :)"

Started close to my house and only found garbage, aside from some nice furniture and broken instrument equipment.

I was able to go through after the end of the year, once students were done, and cleaned up! 2 pairs of Air Force One's, some nearly new Adidas sneakers, and a hilariously gaudy Ed Hardy shirt with studs and panthers on it.

Take note of it. Call Samsung customer service (1 (800) 726-7864), go through the annoying prompts, eventually get a human operator. Tell them that the phone won't turn on anymore and won't respond to being charged, you don't know why. Follow any troubleshooting tips they give you. If it works, yay, if not, go on. They will offer to check warranty. Give them the IMEI. If the warranty is still covered, they will send a UPS slip to your email. You put the slip on a box with the note it is and hand it to UPS when they come by or at the UPS store. Free of charge, samsung will pay for it.

DumpsterDiving,38z1e0,paolobabe99,2,Tue Jun 9 02:00:24 2015 UTC,"yeah go figure since it's an older phone. I think having it fixed would be better than trading it in at a dirt cheap price on your next upgrade. I remember I found two iPhones on one of my escapades and was only offered 30 for one on the upgrade because of 'water damage' to the button, even though it was perfectly fine otherwise.   So basically I would suggest getting it fixed and then just keeping it around as a spare phone/basically an ipod"
DumpsterDiving,38z1e0,Justus222,2,Tue Jun 9 02:16:43 2015 UTC,"Hmm, I'll really have to think about it.

If they asked where you got it just tell them you bought it. If you want to PM the IMEI I can look it up and see if it's not reported stolen. If you don't feel comfortable doing that then just to the nearest T-movile and asked if they can look it up. Have you tried to do a master reset or is it not powering on at all?"
DumpsterDiving,38z1e0,ArcticKeys,3,Tue Jun 9 04:14:26 2015 UTC,"I know it isn't stolen. There's no activity at all with the phone.

DumpsterDiving,38t9qi,Markaleto,2,Sat Jun 6 17:01:30 2015 UTC,How do you tell the open vegetables or fruit aren't bad? Like why do these stores throw these vegetables and fruits out
DumpsterDiving,38t9qi,Markaleto,2,Sat Jun 6 22:27:25 2015 UTC,"You just look at them! A lot of times, it's just by expiration date - so, the wrapped mini cucumbers and bell peppers in my pictures have an expiration date of yesterday (the day I dove them) so the store was basically going on that. The big cucumbers were all in a box, there were like 20 of them, and it was pretty clear that some worker had gone through their big pile of cucumbers and pulled out any with ANY issue (small dents, a little wrinkly on the end, etc.). Some were really bad, but the ones that weren't very bad we grabbed.  As for the apples and potatoes, they were all in bags (you know, 10 apples in a bag or whatever), and in their case one or two of the bag were bad so they threw the entire bag away. In the case of those, we just grabbed the ones that were okay and washed them well when we got home."
DumpsterDiving,38t9qi,Markaleto,2,Sun Jun 7 00:16:53 2015 UTC,"I've never been diving so thanks for the reply. I wasn't exactly sure how it all worked and that explanation provided context. Honest question, and no offense intended, do you think its worth the time and risk associated with taking this discarded food? Time in that you must drive and find this food and risk as it could have been sneezed on or dropped or make you sick or something of the sort. How do you justify taking this when produce is so cheap and the risk seems much higher than the potential award?"
DumpsterDiving,38t9qi,blanky1,3,Sun Jun 7 00:31:06 2015 UTC,"No offense taken! It's so, so worth it. Produce is NOT cheap. I bring home between 30 and 50$ worth of produce each time I go out. And I probably use maybe $5 worth of gas, tops. I've just started so I haven't gotten sick yet, but I also haven't heard of anybody else getting sick. Everything I bring home gets thoroughly washed, scrubbed with a scrubber brush if applicable, and anything questionable gets thrown out. I also peel just about everything if it's peelable - full size carrots, cucumbers, apples. I wouldn't peel them if I bought them from the grocery store, but since I'm pulling them from a dumpster I'm not taking any chances.  There's also pretty much no risk. It's just pop over, look in, see stuff you want? grab it. It's really not dangerous and I'd never get in a dumpster if I were alone.  If the cops pull up, it's ""Sorry officer, there are no trespassing signs and the dumpster wasn't locked, my bad I will leave!""   Also, from what I've found over this past week of diving every day, it's not a 'potential award' - it's basically definite. Of course there are bad days, but I've come home with a haul every single time I've been out.  It's not just a monetary effort for me. I can certainly afford food and produce, but I'm sticking with it for two reasons: it's really fun, like a treasure hunt; and it hurts my soul to know that perfectly good food is going to the dump.  I was raised in a house that had a flourishing garden, composted everything, and nothing was wasted if we could help it. When I heard about diving and people rescuing food from dumpsters, and then I saw it for myself, I just couldn't justify letting perfectly good stuff go to a dump when I could get it and eat it or, in the right circumstances, pass it on to a food bank."

When they opened here I would dive with my grandmother and take all the bread in large black bags so she could feed the birds but then they started allowing shelters to pick it up from there at the end of the day. That's just epically awesome and it's a model that more businesses really need to follow for the benefit of recycling and helping others out. It costs nothing to post on CraigsList or call somewhere and say ""we have chairs out back for free!"", plus if they go to the paper and tell them ""we just donated 100 chairs"" and it gets published then it looks really good for them and everyone wins... except the dumpster company maybe ;-)"

DumpsterDiving,38gu2q,dorchet,7,Thu Jun 4 02:57:25 2015 UTC,"Food diving is the best! But also the worst. Nothing like seeing so much beautiful food in one place. On one hand, you're lowering your grocery bills and getting delicious food. On the other hand, you KNOW you will never be able to take it all, and ultimately all of this food, which is headed to a landfill, could be a life saver for MANY others.  Here's a few advice from me:   If you like fresh food, I'd advice looking at Subway dumpster. Many of their stores throw their bread away after a single day, because they only want to serve the fresh stuff. Others have told me many stores keep their bread much longer and only throw them when they're borderline moldy, but it's worth a check.  Also try to see if there's an independent distribution center / food warehouse. The Veggie warehouse near my place almost always has tons of food. Lastly, try to spot your nearby convenience stores with ready-to-go lunches (sandwhich, etc...). In my experience, most of those ends up in the dumpster. I tend to freeze them so I have sandwiches ready to pick whenever I need them. Not as delicious as homemade ones but certainly very convenient."
DumpsterDiving,38gu2q,AerisaFoxFeather,1 point,Thu Jun 4 13:18:46 2015 UTC,"Other food diving advice: chain drug stores and smaller groceries often throw away items with damaged outer packaging, like cereal, but there is often inner packaging keeping everything inside clean.  If people see you diving food, sometimes they will ""feel sorry"" for you thinking you are broke and offer to put stuff aside for you. Or they for some reason get very personally insulted that you are eating ""their"" food. Responses vary.  Lots of packages of fruit look nasty, but only some of the fruit is over ripe, just do a little sorting.   Get a compost pile, some stuff will look great in the field and turn out to be nasty when you get home."

He ended up being tremendously annoying (Aren't you going to turn off your car? Wait there are people over there. We should be going later the manger is probably still in there. What if we get stopped by the cops and I know the cop? Seriously what if we get stopped by the cops?? Lol.)  It was zeros across the board at our first few stops, but I was saving the best for last - Aldi's.  We get to Aldi's and there's a semi truck backed up over at the loading dock, which is where the dumpster is, and I wasn't ballsy enough to risk it.  So, at this point we're walking away empty handed and I have not remotely shown my dad the diving experience he deserves.  I see a Dollar General in the distance, and figure what the hell? Pull in, he stays in the car and I run up to the dumpster and the dumpster gods decided to give us a small blessing. Inside, there were tons of donuts that we passed up, but also 8 packs of these (my dad's favorite!) and a few boxes of ritz-like crackers. We only brought home one box of the ritz crackers because the rest of the packages were soggy from the rain, but oh well.

My go-to response is that I'm ""looking for my cat""(he likes to dig in the trash), but if you don't think lying's the way to go then I've also communicated pretty well with people by just telling the truth and saying something along the lines of ""you wouldn't believe some of the stuff people throw away"". I've also heard that ""I'm just looking for cardboard boxes""  works pretty well as an excuse in a pinch. Generally, though, the best way is to avoid confrontation.  -If anything, just calling your local police department would be fine for figuring out the legality. Generally, dumpster diving at businesses is illegal, but I think I can speak for a lot of folks here when I say that cops rarely give anyone trouble for it. I myself have encountered cops only once while diving, and they slowed down, saw what I was doing, and just kind of carried on. I think they're more worried about dumpers than divers. The thing to remember if you do get confronted by a cop, however, is to be polite and compliant, and you'll most likely just get off with a warning. Something to always be sure of, though, is that you're not trespassing, because that's a considerably more serious offense. Also, if there are signs saying things like ""no scavenging"" or ""resident use only"", or especially if there are locks on the dumpsters, don't go for it because it generally isn't worth the risk.  -I don't think there really is an ideal clothing choice, just something that isn't going to make you look completely homeless or look like you're going to break into someone's house but that you also don't mind getting a little dirty."
DumpsterDiving,38c3d8,Shastafication,8,Wed Jun 3 07:50:29 2015 UTC,Thank you. I am really excited about this. I see all the food people get on here and I have never been more excited about going to the store!
DumpsterDiving,38c3d8,scabdick,4,Wed Jun 3 07:55:08 2015 UTC,Share with us your experience! I'm scared to go out and dive D:
DumpsterDiving,38c3d8,MajesticVelcro,1 point,Wed Jun 3 09:29:41 2015 UTC,"Definitely wouldn't advise asking the police about the laws, I've read too many stories on this sub of people calling and asking and then getting grilled to the third degree on stuff. Research online, the cops don't need to know because that will seem more suspicious."
DumpsterDiving,38c3d8,dorchet,5,Thu Jun 4 05:15:29 2015 UTC,I was like you 4 days ago. I've been diving 3 times since. Each time has been successful in its own way (you can read my stories in my post history). I highly recommend just biting the bullet and going for a ride.  I was super nervous at first but as soon as I was checking out my first dumpster the nerves went away and it was a blast!
DumpsterDiving,38c3d8,dorchet,4,Wed Jun 3 18:02:29 2015 UTC,"first: google your city/state/country and look up the laws on dumpster diving. ""kansas city dumpster diving"" etc. also consider phoning your local city cops and ask them if its legal, tell them you saw some hippies digging in the garbage and were wondering about the law. haha  time: daylight, so you dont hurt yo self in the dark on some broken glass nonsense.  questioned: truth, you were looking at trash. or stay silent if you dont mind being harassed a bit (this is tougher)  best thing to wear? a thrift store business suit ($5), or white lab coat with clipboard. no one ever questions a guy wearing a lab coat. just kidding. forget looking conspicuous. you are going to look like that anyway. wear grey/black , tight fitting clothing-nothing that will get hooked on sharp dumpsters. wear tight fitting shoes that wont get pulled off by trash. bring gloves, possibly a paint mask type thing to keep dust out of your mouth.  oh and wear cheap/used clothes you dont mind throwing out. i've ripped many clothes on many things. or if you get smeared with some goo, you dont want the goo in the wash with your good clothes. damn goo!  bring hand sanitizer bottle to wash your hands. also spray that on any scrapes/cuts you get. infections are no fun.  tips: dont jump any fences to get to dumpsters. dont make a mess, consider picking up any mess you see- so you cant be blamed for others' messes while you are searching. never get into a dumpster with a racoon."

DumpsterDiving,38c3d8,dorchet,2,Thu Jun 4 02:33:09 2015 UTC,"anytime during the day, but i guess i avoid the busy rushhour times. depends on the location too.  early morning- no one is awake yet so no one cares. 9-12noon people start getting irritable until they get lunch. then after lunch 1-2pm is the sweet spot.  after closing, 6-7pm is also a good time.  if you'd rather go at night, bring a flashlight. head-mounted flashlights keep your hands free."

DumpsterDiving,3868wb,cops-and-queers,5,Tue Jun 2 03:39:46 2015 UTC,"I literally started this week, so I guess I can't be of too much help, but:  1. I've only been going at night (like, after 10 pm)  2. I'm a girl and I've been going by myself, I was expecting to fear for my safety but I really didn't at all. I have found that the places I've gone (strip malls, Aldi's, CVS) are all really well lit, and if there are other divers around I just move on to the next bin and come back later to see if they left anything of interest. I live in the suburbs but some of the places I've been going are in the more notably sketchy parts of town and still no issue. I also have an apartment in the big city so when I get back there I'm going to do some scoping, but that's definitely going to require more cautionary measures."
DumpsterDiving,3868wb,MajesticVelcro,5,Tue Jun 2 17:17:02 2015 UTC,"I go when ever convenient, so if that means after work or on the way to the grocery store, then that's when I do it. This way I am not wasting gas to only dive and not find anything.  Depending on the area you probably have nothing to worry about but be careful with bringing weapons places that you could possibly be trespassed from. Trespassing with a weapon makes it a higher offense most times."
DumpsterDiving,3868wb,jse1988,2,Wed Jun 3 00:25:18 2015 UTC,I usually go at night and it's been great. You don't have people bugging you and its peaceful.  Also during the day try to scout the areas you are going to dive at night. It helps to know where you are going. 2.I am a male and I haven't feared for my safety yet. That's awesome that your boyfriend is going with you. I wish I could take someone with me at times. But take pepper spray with when he doesn't feel like going. Also trust your gut if you feel like you need to go then just leave. I've left a few times when I heard a strange sound or I think I saw something move.
DumpsterDiving,3856wv,MajesticVelcro,3,Mon Jun 1 22:57:52 2015 UTC,"After all that, I did forget to go to the other CVS. I guess that's on the to-do list for tonight (if it would just stop raining!)"
DumpsterDiving,381vjd,anonindy1,3,Mon Jun 1 06:37:00 2015 UTC,"Why not just stick around and explain this..? I enjoy talking to other divers. All of my interactions are 100% positive. If people are there sometimes I'll just walk up and say hello, one time I snuck up on a guy and said something like ""security!"" and then shine a light in their face then gave them the jk and they got a kick out of it. But you just say hey, grab afew things and move along. Also I typically just go for groceries so usually there is plenty to go around."
DumpsterDiving,381vjd,brinnswf,3,Mon Jun 1 19:36:16 2015 UTC,"Yea, the bad apples ruin it for the whole bunch. Some people are just dense and don't get it, and never will. They dive like a bull in a China shop and are begging to get hassled by police and management. If they would be discreet, quiet, pleasant and respectful of property, and if they would not blab all the good spots to everyone so the police and non serious divers know exactly where to go so that pickings are now much slimmer, then diving would be a much better activity. And yes, you tube videos are destroying dumpster diving. The more people that know about it and know the spots because of blabbers, the more the finds will dry up. Finally, try to give back to others, especially the poor. We get lots of stuff, no reason not to donate some of it to charity and help people."
DumpsterDiving,381vjd,Jamesfire,3,Tue Jun 2 04:20:31 2015 UTC,"Maybe try to gently educate him. I did this once successfully with a guy who backed his pickup truck into a trash/recycling bay behind a store I frequent. He was taking cardboard (probably to resell.) I pointed out to him that it was broad daylight and he wasn't being very discreet. I also told him they would start locking the gates if he took so much stuff and/or they realized someone had been there. He thanked me and moved his truck, then only took a few boxes. I'm still SMH at how someone could be so clueless, though."
DumpsterDiving,381vjd,pixelated_fun,3,Tue Jun 2 07:00:21 2015 UTC,"I was dumpster diving with a buddy a few weeks ago when we saw a white minivan pull up so we ran off, thinking it was security or something. Pretty soon we saw them digging through trash too, realized they were fellow divers, so we hung out with them and showed them a couple spots, including a local thrift store that seems to throw half their donations into the dumpster. Issue was, when we told them to meet us there, we were waiting for them in the back, until we realized they were in the front, raiding the donation box. That definitely pushed my buttons a bit, it's one thing to grab what they throw out, but stealing donations? That ain't cool. Weird thing was tho, there was a camera in the back on the dumpster, but zero up front by the donation bin."
DumpsterDiving,381vjd,scabdick,1 point,Thu Jun 4 05:11:53 2015 UTC,"Was there a back dock and door also by the roll off? That's probably why the camera. I have a thrift I hit too just like that, and yes they throw out some good stuff sometimes. They also have a compactor with gaps that I can get my dive tool into to pull out even more."
DumpsterDiving,381vjd,Jamesfire,1 point,Thu Jun 4 16:25:51 2015 UTC,"The dumpster is at the back along with a back door and stuff, yeah, but the building is gigantic and the camera is clearly pointed right at the dumpster. My buddies and I just wear hoodies, plus I doubt the camera has very high resolution, nor do they probably check it often. Best thing I've found so far was a 12"" Audiobahn subwoofer, planning to sell it but I'm kinda worried it was originally stolen, cuz who the fuck donates something like that to Savers? I don't wanna pawn it off and end up in jail, so I might try Craigslist once I test it out."

DumpsterDiving,381cd5,slovenry,5,Mon Jun 1 03:21:55 2015 UTC,"I can only tell you about dumpster diving in Copenhagen. Food: Quite a lot of good spots behind supermarkets, bakers, gas station (they dump a lot of sandwiches, pastries and bread). Supermarkets usually dump vegetables and fruits but also meat (good on winter), dairy products and sometimes non-food. Non-food: In the cities, there are special containers or garbage rooms for the big non organic wast (storskrald in danish). They are usually located in the yards of the buildings. Some of them are accessible from the street, some not. Some areas collect bulky waste 1 or 2 times a month. So people set their stuff in front of their houses. Grab a bike and a trailer and enjoy the ride :) You can find some very nice non-food things in ""storskrald"". A lot of electronics, furnitures, cloth ... Law: It is not illegal to dumpster dive if the container is accessible from the street without trespassing a private area. But I think picking up ""storskrald"" is considered stealing. EDIT: my experience is mainly in the close suburbs of Copenhagen. I don't know about dumpster diving in the city center.  It might be more difficult."

This even includes private property and businesses. If it's not trespassing to get to the dumpster it's not trespassing to dumpster dive. Though any property owner or manager may trespass you if it's off public property or public right of way that just means you have to leave when informed you are trespassed. Note that roads have an easement such that within so many feet of the road you have a public right of way even on private property. Check your muni codes.  There are times when a cop gets a call from a tenant, or just takes it upon themselves, to tell you that they are going to have to ask you to leave. A tenant has no authority to trespass people from commons areas. Yet the best approach is to just say ""sure."" What this does is if you choose to come back another day and this cop attempts to arrest you you have a defense in that agreeing to a request to leave by someone who has no authority to trespass you does not convert it into a trespass. Trespass is not consensual.   Go crazy, be accommodating, don't leave a mess, don't trespass, and everything will be fine."

DumpsterDiving,37u2ht,axc86,4,Sat May 30 11:49:19 2015 UTC,"I use to dumpster dive (or ""skipping"" as most people call it round here) consistently as it was my main source of food for several years. The only advice I can give you really is find a store, find their bins and start rummaging! The big four supermarkets (Tesco, Sainsburys, Morrisons and Asda) are probably the best places to look though the bigger the store the more likely they are to have a trash compactor rather than a bin. Smaller chain stores (Tesco Extra etc.) are usually better in my opinion.  I've never been arrested for dumpster diving, the only times I have ever been stopped by the police I have explained what I've been doing and they have generally been quite supportive! I have known people be arrested and charged for ""theft by finding"" or ""vagrancy(!)"" but neither charge stuck and they were mainly arrested for climbing fencing and trespassing on company property.  I always go at night, not only because there are less people around, but because most stores throw out their food at the end of the day. If you start rummaging through the bins at midday not only are you going to draw more attention to yourself but you're going to be sifting through day old food that has been left to bake in a warm metal bin.  If you're uncomfortable going on your own at night try and find one more person to go with you. Just that extra person can help give you the courage you need and can act as a look out while you've got your head in the bin!   One last thing, I'd always advise bringing gloves, a head torch and carrier bags (sometimes you find something that is either split or covered in god knows what that you don't want staining your bag). Other than that, good luck and good diving!"
DumpsterDiving,37u2ht,dirtysquatter,2,Sat May 30 13:32:38 2015 UTC,"Never ask permission, the answer is no due to liability concerns. Don't worry about getting caught.

DumpsterDiving,37r9z7,YesWizard,1 point,Fri May 29 19:27:27 2015 UTC,"You mean entering the employee-only sections inside the mall that you dress up like an employee to access? That sounds like trespassing, as opposed to walking up to a dumpster outdoors."
DumpsterDiving,37r9z7,dublzz,4,Fri May 29 20:28:27 2015 UTC,"As a diver, and former mall security, it varies by location. Sometimes the compactors break and they'll bring in a regular one. For legal liability reasons they don't allow diving on the premises and stores usually have a policy on destroying things before they throw it out especially promotional or marketing items. If you are courteous, you won't get much hassle out of them but after a few times you might get banned/ criminal trespass. Some stores might have their own dumpster, as well as after close you'll sometimes find things next to it as tenants don't hit the compact button and it fills up causing them to lay it down next to it."
DumpsterDiving,37r9z7,Absolving_Truth,2,Fri May 29 21:52:35 2015 UTC,"Mall security tends to be a little touchy, and often don't have much better to do than look around for people acting in ways that they consider strange, and most people think diving is strange."
DumpsterDiving,37r9z7,Scraplington,1 point,Fri May 29 22:12:49 2015 UTC,"It really depends on the location, Not all malls are alike. You just would need to look at the area, figure out if it's worth it, and try or move on."
DumpsterDiving,37r9z7,cesariojpn,1 point,Fri May 29 22:30:00 2015 UTC,"Mall dumpsters are actually gold mines if you can get past the security and cameras. The key is to dive enough that you discover which stores are the wasteful ones, and then having a path to diving without being caught. An inside job sort of thing really helps (As Absolving_truth kindly pointed out)."
DumpsterDiving,37r9z7,Jamesfire,0,Fri May 29 22:51:35 2015 UTC,I guess it really depends on the location that you go to. The one that is around in my area the security/surveillance wing is RIGHT were the compactor is. Wither if they would stop me or not I have no idea.

DumpsterDiving,37mnwm,stinkycretingurl,32,Fri May 29 15:09:21 2015 UTC,"wow! awesome! some of those products are discontinued so you're a lucky duck!   word to the wise - I would get rid of anything you cant sharpen or chop off an end. These could have been thrown out because the person it was used on had infections or some other health concern. I would toss anything with a wand as the entire product could be contaminated. I would say the same for anything that's a ""pot of goo"" i.e. liquid foundations, gel liners, or crème blush/eyeshadows. Lip sticks - You can slice off the top layer and you should be fine. Eyeshadows, blush and other powders - wipe these down with cotton balls soaked in alcohol. You'll save the integrity of the product while ridding it of all those nasty germs. And anything pencil - over-sharpen (just to be sure). And don't forget to give your sharpener a good alcohol bath after the fact.  Excellent haul! Very lucky!"

I only dive enough for one book bag size. Bringing a friend along especially one whose ethics is not to go into the dumpster but wants everything like my friend does, not highly recommended haha."
DumpsterDiving,37nn06,DeMiDeViL1,7,Thu May 28 23:51:26 2015 UTC,"Why is everyone saying go alone? Bringing a friend is always the best idea for many reasons. The first and most obvious reason is to help you such as carrying things to the car or doing the driving so you can hop out, check the dumpster and get out as fast as possible. Other advantages include being a lookout while you are in the dumpster and finally the most important is to have someone there incase something bad happens. I have heard countless stories of people who dive in the morning (which I don't recommend) almost dying because it was pickup day and the pickup crew didn't hear them screaming in the dumpster. Diving with a friend or two is always the best (And most fun) way to dive."

DumpsterDiving,37nn06,alb404,2,Fri May 29 05:43:42 2015 UTC,I'd go alone as well. Just remember basic safety rules. http://www.reddit.com/r/dumpsterdiving/wiki/safety
DumpsterDiving,37nn06,Empyrealist,2,Fri May 29 18:27:41 2015 UTC,"I recommend 2-3 max.  It can be dangerous going alone with no one to watch for police, and particularly; no one to watch you back from miscreants.  Anything over two, I recommend that you have some distance between each other.   Any additionally paired people that are standing close to each other can appear suspicious.  What looks normal walking down the street or otherwise hanging out, does not look normal behind a building or in the shadows."
DumpsterDiving,37nn06,Jamesfire,2,Fri May 29 20:36:08 2015 UTC,"Go alone. Why? Put yourself in the position of a police officer, security officer, or store employee out back on smoke break, or retail manager. If they see a vehicle drive behind a building with one occupant, it looks less suspicious. If you see two people in the vehicle, all of a sudden it seems more suspicious. I know this is a little thing, but it is true. Diving alone is much less risky. Lower chance of being seen or heard. Plus, it is best not to have to split the finds. I used to want to find a dive partner to help me with the fear of being caught. Then I got over it and my finds improved dramatically."

DumpsterDiving,37klfm,JosephFurguson,1 point,Thu May 28 12:39:20 2015 UTC,"As someone who works in a grocery store, we can get in trouble for selling food that has passed the printed expiration date. People can get food poisoning(or claim they did). It may be technically legal to do it, but it's less of a headache to not do it. It's also not an ethical thing to do in general. My store throws out anything that's ""out of code.""    I'd also like to add, if stores throw food away and it's not past the printed date, then there's a damn good reason its in the trash. Like recalls or something affected the food batch.  Just today I saw that we had a whole batch of grapefruit juice that had rotten pulp floating around in it(it was dark brown and chunky). I notified someone in the dairy dept and they quickly chucked it all.  I don't even think it's good that people get fresh produce out of dumpsters. Produce absorbs whatever toxins that are in that dumpster in just a short time.   TLDR; I work in a grocery store, don't eat the food in our dumpsters, it be dank and nasty."

I notified someone in the dairy dept and they quickly chucked it   Using one example of seeing a batch of grapefruit juice for  every single garbage ever thrown out is a poor argument, and actually a fallacy of appeal to common practice. Some people live off of eating garbage, I'm pretty sure you have never been into a dumpster because most of the food I have ever found is in a bag, inside of another bag, which doesn't actually touch the dumpster it self. Some products are completely sealed, some products have more ingredients than  we can count. I feed homeless people, I give to charities, I even eat the food my self and I have a horrible stomach and the food I find doesn't irritate it at all. I appreciate your insight but it's not going to stop the majority of us from diving for items or food."

Also, who, other than homeless people and divers would naturally be going through trash for food/etc?"

DumpsterDiving,377at5,sarahmedlin,0,Wed May 27 11:28:41 2015 UTC,"The premise of not mentioning store names is that stores may begin to lock their dumpsters or damage their goods to prevent dumpster diving.

(I'm a bot)     French supermarkets will be banned from throwing away or destroying unsold food and must instead donate it to charities or for animal feed, under a law set to crack down on food waste.  Some supermarkets doused binned food in bleach to prevent potential food-poisoning by eating food from bins.  Members of the Gars'pilleurs, an action group founded in Lyon, don gardening gloves to remove food from supermarket bins at night and redistribute it on the streets the next morning to raise awareness about waste, poverty and food distribution.

DumpsterDiving,36uk98,autotldr,5,Fri May 22 22:11:49 2015 UTC,Not sure why this is news. It's already illegal in France's constitution to stop people from eating out of dumpsters. It's also illegal to prevent people from going to fields and collecting food waste from them.
DumpsterDiving,36uk98,JosephFurguson,7,Fri May 22 11:18:45 2015 UTC,"Now they might be forced to not even throw good food out in the first place, but send it to charity. Which is amazing and I have no idea why it took so long to enforce it and why it's not worldwide."

Supermarkets have said that charities must now also be properly equipped with fridges and trucks to be able to handle the food donations.""  Lol is this supposed to be a problem?   I help set things up at a church every week  that hooks up about 20 people with about 5 days worth of food or more(trader joes, safeway and a small local shop donated food). one truck, one standard fridge, for perishables about 5 people to set up tables, toss some bad fruit and put food on the table .

Fumigated the shit out of the mattress on that bed for like a week.  College kids moving out always leave the best stuff behind.  That reminds me, when I was 10-12 I lived in a pretty dense apartment complex that happened to boarder farmland, a wooded trail, and a creek, so while it was a dense area (and thus a lot of trash and big industrial dumpsters) we had plenty of woods right nearby to build forts and bases with all the crap we pillaged.  We got kitchen tables, chairs, two sofas, and at least two armchairs over the course of all those years, in addition to basically everything else. We ripped apart steel bedframes and locked them together and covered them with holey sheets to make enclosures. We also found a working microwave and toaster. Was the best."

Turned out it was working perfectly - headset powered up fine and beeped (there even were rechargable batteries inside), but transmitting base was dead. I sniffed power socket, which smelt burnt, took it apart and found destroyed cap right at power port. Replaced and now I have pretty fancy headset. One of those days I'll replace weak AAA batteries with li-ion and maybe add hardware from cheap BT headset so I could use mic (it's only support X360 via wire). Funny thing, now I have three headsets (this one, original Beats Studio 2.0 I got for 2 bucks from some guys selling stuff from repair shop (discharged too low (easy fix), ripped cushions (asked mom to make new one out of leather - replacing them is pain in the ass since everything is on glue)) and Senheiser HD555 my friend gave me when moving), which I planned to turn into wireless, but they turned out to be working. Otherwise, I haven't found much aside from some scrapped materials, but I live in Russia, DD here is hard - most of trash bins picked clean by hobos and elderly during the day, stores almost never throw anything away - it's either stays forever or sold cheaply to some other buisnesses, and people tend to keep shit until it's broken irrepairably."

DumpsterDiving,36n6n7,fieryroach,1 point,Wed May 20 16:42:17 2015 UTC,"I went to my local gamestop and found a bunch of Nintendo DS game cases. I was pretty stoked because there was at least 20 or more games there. Opened up the first case, the game was gone. Everything else including the instruction manual was there but no game. Checked about 10 other boxes and same thing.   That left me wondering if they are throwing out the boxes, why not throw out the games as well?"
DumpsterDiving,36n6n7,almondcookie,4,Wed May 20 16:46:35 2015 UTC,"Usually because these are old DS games that people have traded in, and those cases take up a lot more room than the little game cartridges. Inside the store there is a display case with all the games, and sometimes they put them in envelopes (like those CD sleeves) so you can look through them and buy them cheap."

DumpsterDiving,36il8d,hilhil83,1 point,Tue May 19 17:34:03 2015 UTC,I will take a look at this; I will get back to you once resolved.
DumpsterDiving,36gybr,BorangeX,4,Tue May 19 08:53:28 2015 UTC,"Some advice.   Wear comfortable clothes you no longer care about. Long Sleeved Shirts and pants are the best. Wear a hat of some kind, mostly to keep stuff out of your hair. Use work gloves, or thick 5 ml disposable gloves.  Have a flashlight. A headlamp is best, but any that's small, lightweight and portable will work. A reacher grabber of some type. Just because it's called Dumpster Diving doesn't mean you have to get inside dumpsters. It also helps with keeping the place tidy after your done.    Start out cheaply, then upgrade. Most of the tools I use come from Harbor Freight. They work just fine for my current needs, but I'll probably upgrade to better tools as soon as I can.   If it smells bad, avoid.   If it's heavy, consider a look. It probably won't be food.   If it's heavy and smells bad, then avoid. It's probably spoiled food."
DumpsterDiving,36gybr,JosephFurguson,3,Tue May 19 14:10:20 2015 UTC,Be careful. Protect yourself. If it smells bad stay away. Check the sidebar>>>> http://www.reddit.com/r/DumpsterDiving/wiki/index

DumpsterDiving,36gybr,reciounet,2,Tue May 19 20:52:12 2015 UTC,"I'm new to diving too, I made a post awhile ago that has some good tips.   If you don't have a car or truck use a bike and a backpack or just a backpack. You'll have make sure you're not carrying anything heavy though.   As for figuring out where to go, just walk around and look. They're everywhere. I usually drive my car so I see tons of opportunity and remember where those dumpsters were.   Also google maps can help you find them too.  Also depending on city you can check the dumpster map the subreddit has by looking on the sidebar"
DumpsterDiving,36gybr,Shastafication,2,Tue May 19 11:23:28 2015 UTC,"I recommend diving during the daytime, it makes you seem less suspicious to cops/workers, also you don't have to carry a flashlight."
DumpsterDiving,36gybr,CanDoBlue,2,Tue May 19 19:22:05 2015 UTC,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51fJQV9wFfL.jpg  Who needs a truck? This has been my solution for 8 years.  Just start. Find some shops near your house where the bins are outdoors and just look in. Gloves and a flashlight are about the only things you need.  Don't leave a mess. Leave the place at least as clean as you found it. Check laws for diving in your country.

I've found some GREAT things in their dumpsters!!! What makes me really sad though is that there's hungry people out there who could be eating this stuff but it's cheaper for a place like that to just destroy all that food.
DumpsterDiving,36d0db,jedi3881,4,Mon May 18 15:56:08 2015 UTC,This is a recent development with our store. It didn't use to be this way.
DumpsterDiving,36d0db,Nut_Cluster,3,Mon May 18 17:03:27 2015 UTC,"I know someone that works in a store where divers visit frequently for food stuffs, and was instructed to dispose of any food by opening the product in such a manner, but he puts each item (as he opens them) in individual bags and then puts them in a single black bag going into the dumpster. He even goes one step further and marks it with a pink tie wrap so particular divers know which bags have salvageable food.   He works the night shift so, nobody is the wiser."
DumpsterDiving,36d0db,Yooksi,5,Tue May 19 12:09:36 2015 UTC,"Could you explain the last part please? So the diver who were actually store employees were taking the food packaging from the trash and trying to get a store refund, right?  If this is the case then this is pretty bad.  Any idea why would these people do such things?"
DumpsterDiving,36d0db,henry82,8,Mon May 18 12:52:56 2015 UTC,"The divers were contractors working on the roof.  The Lig Bots moved to a new location, and I assume some repairs, or installs, needed to happen.  They saw the loot, and tried to rip off the store."

DumpsterDiving,36d0db,Yooksi,2,Mon May 18 14:59:45 2015 UTC,"Solution: mark up the package as ""garbage"" or ""expired"" and write a alphanumerical code in marker on the package that only the staff know what it means.

I haven't spent a dime on dumpster diving out of my own pocket. The things I would find like my vitamin shoppe haul around 110 sports bars, i would give some to homeless and sell 30 for 10$.

Office supply store.   What reactions do you get?   Guy offered me a beer once.  Typically, nobody ever saw me though.    What results do you expect?  The place I frequented, I'd expect to see a ton of broken paper shredders, boxes of flyers, a bag containing the employees' fast food containers, and a few times a month, a desk, chair, filing cabinet, etc.  Several times a year they'd throw out a box of ink cartridges.

DumpsterDiving,36at5q,icyhotonmynuts,5,Mon May 18 05:52:21 2015 UTC,"What do you guys take?   I usually go for food items these days. Got plenty of furniture/electronics/knock-knacks cluttering up the house as it is.    Where are the best places to go?    For beginners, I usually recommend a dollar store, drug store, or thrift shop. They each have a wide variety of goods that they toss on a fairly regular basis. Any food you find will be the pre-packaged variety.   What reactions do you get?   I go out between 2-4AM, so the only ones that I come across are the police. They don't care. Any earlier and I run into the drunken bar crowd; any later and I get in the way of the early delivery trucks.   What results do you expect?   Often, enough food to supplement meals for another week. Got a nice haul of biscuits-in-a-tube and some bags of pre-shredded chipotle cheese, so it was biscuits and quesadillas for a while. Good cheese, that was. Yum."

DumpsterDiving,36at5q,Jamesfire,6,Mon May 18 09:15:30 2015 UTC,"Pretty much. If it looks okay, smells okay, and feels okay, it's probably okay.

I live in a good town but bad stuff can still happen. Trust your instincts.  As far as protective clothing, I wear jeans, work gloves, and an old t shirt that I don't mind ruining. My diving jeans permanently smell like cucumbers, no matter how much I wash them.  I have a headlamp which leaves both my hands free for sorting through stuff. I have a grabber stick for getting things deeper inside if it's a dumpster I would rather not climb into.

Heck, if you have time this year you could even start now...a lot of college students, especially graduates, throw out still-edible food at the end of the year, like packaged soups and cereals, teas and coffees, and also things like protein powder.

DumpsterDiving,369fdi,PretzelMeister,3,Tue May 19 12:19:48 2015 UTC,"The best time at certain grocery stores is in broad daylight on Saturday or Sunday afternoon when all employees are inside dealing with a huge rush of customers and no one is out taking a break or taking out trash. Customers getting out of their cars and going inside might see you but if you're confident and quick and make no mess, no one seems to care. At my favorite grocery store, night time is actually not so great: the employees are outside taking breaks and dealing with trash and walking back and forth from their cars from sundown until 1am, and after they are all gone, I am the only person around, so it's easy for a security, police, or maintenance to spot me. Often better to blend into plain sight. Cold winter days and rainy days are often good because no employees want to stand around outside.  Also, very early morning, just before sunrise, especially if the store in question won't be open that day or will be opening late, is sometimes good. Retail trash tends to accumulate on Saturday and Sunday, with early Monday morning being the usual time for garbage trucks to be roaming a city.  Always case the area, and look around the dumpsters in an enclosed place, before getting yourself into a corner. Always peek out of the dumpster and listen carefully when you're in it to make sure no one is approaching you. Often, standing at a distance while faking looking at or talking on your phone makes it look like you're doing something normal when in fact you're casing the area. The places I go often have employee break areas nearby, and if I see employees outside I'll wait, look at my phone, or find a place to sit and read a book until they go away.  As a guy, I can't really speak to what a girl should look out for. Maybe carry pepper spray and a knife? In 8+ years of diving, security has only approached me twice and let me continue diving, employees have asked me to leave only a few times, cops have never approached me, and all the bums in my area refuse to eat trash so they keep their distance. Sometimes I see fellow divers, but I've only been approached by a normal customer once or twice -- normal people with money aren't interested in trash-pickers. But then again, I'm a guy.  The backside of stripmalls and big box stores are pretty sketchy. Buddy system is probably best for those places. Trader Joe, Aldi, pizza chains, donut shops (watch out for cops!), and any bagel place or bakery are probably good places to start solo."

As for protection, I have an Uzi Taser (pink!) that I carry in a case strapped to my belt. The only times I've unholstered it, simply activating the charge was enough to scare off my ""attacker"" (it makes a very loud crackle). I've had one for years and highly recommend it because it does not necessarily need to be revealed to your attacker until you actually need to use it, making it less likely you'll have it taken from you. $58 on Amazon."

I think I spotted an LG Xenon in that list of phones. I think those phones are right around 5+ years old. No SIM slots? They're CDMA - Telus doesn't really run on CDMA anymore, they're HSPA and LTE now. I mean, I haven't seen a single phone offered by Telus that still runs on CDMA, at least in my market. If any of them DO have a SIM slot, they're probably just 3G as Telus never ran on the GSM network (they're towers were CDMA compatible). It's Rogers and Fido that were GSM+3G.

DumpsterDiving,366h27,FlockinOnTheseWakas,2,Sun May 17 17:39:53 2015 UTC,It's a public university and therefore there is only trespassing for areas that are restricted to the public. Outside dorms or whatever isn't trespassing.

DumpsterDiving,366ibp,awalktojericho,1 point,Sat May 16 17:05:34 2015 UTC,"With this pitcher, the bypass is simple. You see the lid ""locks"" down into place, there is only one way to put the lid on. The lid has a flap like a pail/bucket with a handle. When that handle locks into the closed position, it has a little nipple that presses down on the top part of the handle of the pitcher. The pitcher has a long piece of spring loaded plastic which then extends to the bottom and pops out. When it pops out, it pushes down a sensor button in the base of the blender that enables the user to use the functions of the blender.   Make sense?"

DumpsterDiving,366ibp,-Baconella-,1 point,Sat May 16 22:41:37 2015 UTC,"Hey OP, what's the model number of the blender?   You assume incorrectly about using generic cups/pitchers. Just about every model uses specific to the model of the blender pitcher/cups. For example you can't use the pitcher from a BL820 in a BL660 because the drive is different and the blade system is different. In the BL660 the pitcher has no blades built in, and you slide your pipe of 6 blades onto the drive motor (plastic). In the BL820, the pitcher has 2 blades built in, and you can attach a pipe of 4 more blades. The gear drive on this one is metal. So their respective cups are different. The BL660's inside of the cups are plastic, whereas the BL820's is metal. I haven't seen the new BL682 which tries to compete directly with Vitamix and Blendtec with their ""push for auto mixing"" feature. IMHO the BL820 ""Ultima"" package was their best, but they went too ""organic"" with the BL682 trying to appeal to the health conscious. Hit me up with a PM if you have more version specific questions. Although, I have to say I don't have any experience with their pre ""square pitcher"" blenders, so if that's what you have, sorry bud."

DumpsterDiving,364qa9,blanky1,1 point,Sun May 17 06:41:50 2015 UTC,"I'm sure there are ""homeless"" people out there who do eat out of the trash, but I've had many short conversations about how to get food out of dumpsters with people who appear to be homeless and are asking for food, and they have always refused the idea. This has happened dozens of times, including when they've found me in the trash, offering them food from my bucket -- they don't want it. It's weird to me. If I were homeless (and I've been close!) I would be relying on dumpstered food even more than I do now -- and right now I'm getting 90% of my diet from the trash.   I wonder if any large survey of this has been done. I'm sure my conversations aren't representative."
DumpsterDiving,364qa9,blanky1,1 point,Tue May 19 11:39:26 2015 UTC,Yeah my experience is similar. It's a strange attitude to me: you can get bountiful food for free without bothering anyone... But you prefer to pan handle?
DumpsterDiving,364qa9,jetercrazy,4,Thu May 21 23:27:08 2015 UTC,"Wow. That is A LOT of food. If you don't mind me asking, where do you find all of it? Is it from one specific dumpster, or several dumpsters? Do you travel far, or do you dive right in your town? Lastly, you don't have to give specific names or locations, but does this all get thrown away at supermarkets or restaurants or a mix of both, or some place completely different? I've always been fascinated by this, and I am amazed that businesses would rather throw out unspoiled food, rather than donate it or give it away once it's ""sell by"" date has passed."
DumpsterDiving,364qa9,Aladayle,3,Thu May 21 23:48:24 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't mind telling you where this is from if we were talking in person, but nothing good comes of saying it so bluntly on the internet. Anyone who knows this list will know where this food is from. Most of this came from just one grocery store that has a compost dumpster (the employees remove packaging and dump food all together in one big bin along with some cardboard). For a while there was another grocery store that threw away the craziest things, but they moved their bin to a locked location.   Most really large grocery stores have compactors. Mid-size or small stores usually have dumpsters you can go in. My main spot is a few miles from my house in my city. On my way back from that grocery store, I stop at a pizza place (a dozen pizzas on top of the dumpster most evenings) or if there's no pizza, then I go to the bakery (every bakery/bagel/donut shop in town throws away bag after bag of food). I haven't found any good restaurant dumpsters, though there's a brewery near me that sometimes throws away truckloads of beer.   :)  If I could afford to operate a pickup truck, I would totally try to start a food waste hauling / composting service. I'd do it for free and raise pigs on what I can't eat!"
DumpsterDiving,364qa9,Aladayle,2,Sun May 17 03:43:01 2015 UTC,I am going to take a guess and say that this is from a grocery store with insane standards that throws out shitloads of stuff which it is said you can spend a whole paycheck.
DumpsterDiving,364qa9,Yooksi,2,Sun May 17 04:03:41 2015 UTC,"Ah, you know, that particular establishment has a compactor! They do indeed trash thousands of pounds of perfectly good food each week, but none of us divers want to go in the compactor, if it's even possible. If it's any solace, that compactor appears to be headed to a commercial organic waste composter rather than a landfill... not a total loss for planet earth!"
DumpsterDiving,364qa9,queeragnosticvegan,2,Sun May 17 06:41:29 2015 UTC,Well at least one store has the sense to do that stuff then! Good news there.

Taking an order with a nice pen (I'd never let a guest use it to sign their check or it would disappear) makes you feel and look more professional and lends a bright spot in a day where you're working a rather thankless job.

If asked to leave, leave, or then it becomes trespassing. Don't dive at crazy hours until you are good enough to know an area like the lines on your hand. Finally, give back.

It is instead those who take it that are successful to some degree or another.    You should just break the law and get mad when consequences are enforced?    Sure. If you have no respect for the law, who cares if you break it? Laws against dumpster diving and the legal infrastructure's privileging of 'private property' above the needs of individuals are ridiculous and deserve no respect. If you can break those laws and get away with it, certainly do so. If you do not get away with it, why not use whatever repression you experience as a place to describe your position that the hegemony of the state is illegitimate. You speak as though the law and its implicit social contract have some sort of metaphysical legitimacy or something greater than the complacency of citizens.

Chemical exposure of article  Microwave oven:       Some magnetrons have ceramic insulators with beryllium oxide (beryllia) added. The beryllium in such oxides is a serious chemical hazard if crushed and ingested (for example, by inhaling dust). In addition, beryllia is listed as a confirmed human carcinogen by the IARC; therefore, broken ceramic insulators or magnetrons should not be handled. This is obviously a danger only if the microwave oven becomes physically damaged, such as if the insulator cracks, or when the magnetron is opened and handled directly, and as such should not be a concern during normal usage.

The microwave has 2-3 motors in it. The capacitor is solid copper, but be careful removing it. There's also a wire bundle that could potentially be copper or aluminum, depending on how cheap it is.

DumpsterDiving,35mga6,brinnswf,18,Mon May 11 18:34:27 2015 UTC,"Don't bother asking permission. It's a waste of time and garners unwarranted attention. Dumpster diving is one of those things people just don't need to know about. First off, it does weird some people out. It's harmless and most people realize this after some thought, but they don't like the idea of someone running around grabbing things out of their trash can. Secondly if you get hurt you could technically sue them so that's another reason to not officially condone it. But since you're not actually breaking in or hurting the business financially they don't have strong reasons to do anything about it ESPECIALLY if they don't know. Just do it during times you probably wont run into people and make sure to not leave a mess. If you follow those two steps you'll be fine. The one time I got questioned by police (out of hundreds of other dives) was 11:30 on a sat and a cruiser saw me pull behind a store. He had to check it out cause it probably did look suspect, I just explained I was looking for food in the trash and offered him my license. My lack of shady behavior and cooperation made it a very quick transaction, I said I would be leaving and we were both on our way."

DumpsterDiving,35mga6,thatvoicewasreal,0,Tue May 19 04:32:16 2015 UTC,"Secondly if you get hurt you could technically sue them so that's another reason to not officially condone it.   It's also a reason to prosecute for trespassing. Why should the business leave itself open to a suit? Depending on the state and municipality, if you are on their property after business hours with no good reason, it is in fact against the law and they are within their rights to call the cops if they don't want you doing it. Sure, it's better to ask forgiveness than permission, but don't kid OP. The cops in OPs town are clearly hostile to it and told OP so; further, for some reason OP isn't taking trespassing, larceny, or disorderly conduct as specific enough laws. If he wants to pull the municipal statutes for those infractions to check, that's one thing, but to get that answer from a cop and keep asking the same question takes a special kind of...well, call it whatever you want.  Not asking permission, if one is determined to do it anyway, is sage advice. Pro tip: don't ask permission to illegally download files, either. Don't ask permission to deliberately park in a no parking zone. Don't ask permission to shoplift that candy bar."

By being ignorant of the laws, you can always plead ignorance and promise not to do it again. Most police officers have better things to do as long as they do not get a call from an angry store manager or neighbor at midnight complaining about the noise.  Also, as much as you are new, do not brag about finds and tell everybody the stores we get our scores at. Make new divers earn it. Otherwise, next thing you know your finds are gone and the police know exactly which stores we frequent so they can stake it out one night when they are slow. Its just dumb.

DumpsterDiving,35i3yq,EntyAnne,14,Sun May 10 19:55:17 2015 UTC,I have a feeling they're going to go to the recycling center. That's why I'm reluctant to take much from it.
DumpsterDiving,35i3yq,l33tSpeak,2,Mon May 11 12:10:56 2015 UTC,"If they are in a recycling container, chances are it has a sign on it telling you to stay out of it. Which would make entering the container illegal."

DumpsterDiving,35i3yq,elongated_smiley,2,Sun May 10 23:33:42 2015 UTC,"Why? It's significantly better to reuse than to recycle. First reuse, then recycle. Why would this be morally questionable in your view?"
DumpsterDiving,35i3yq,Consor,7,Mon May 11 02:13:17 2015 UTC,"If it is a recycling company, or even supposed to go to a recycling company they get money for it, so you are directly taking away (part of) a company's business.

Basically, I would stick to maybe pizza's tossed at closing time, and chips or anything in a can or bag should be fine as long as no punctures. Save the meat and juices for winter time."

Produce sometimes good if you peel it, but even produce that looks good tends to decay really quickly in the heat, which means I end up composting a lot, which is better than seeing it go in the landfill."

I suppose big lots doesnt donate anything expired so I'll be making a weekly trip to their dumpster. Where are some of the best places to find more food/useable items?

For other places to get food, I would recommend seeing if you have a food warehouse / Distributor nearby. I get a lot of fresh vegetables and fruit there. If you like bread, Subway restaurants are also very good, but sort of a hit or miss. Restaurants have different policies, so some only throw away their very old and stale bread, while others throw all of their bread away after each work day. It's worth checking, just be aware that they likely will be in garbage bags, and there may be some trash mixed in with them."

DumpsterDiving,35gp6d,Mrninjamonkey,3,Sun May 10 15:40:15 2015 UTC,Went yesterday for six hours. Only hit the apartments and did pretty well. We ignore the dorms for the most part as we've never had much luck.
DumpsterDiving,35gp6d,Ashe400,3,Sun May 10 17:29:15 2015 UTC,"I usually have the opposite experience, around here it seems like the younger kids who live in dorms are usually more wasteful and yield better hauls.."
DumpsterDiving,35gp6d,plinth19,2,Mon May 11 19:44:16 2015 UTC,At our university the campus dorms are hounded by people waiting for the stuff to get thrown out. It's sort of insane. We ran into maybe five other people doing it this weekend and we were all having a bad day due to the weather.
DumpsterDiving,35gp6d,Ashe400,2,Mon May 11 20:28:24 2015 UTC,Which university?
DumpsterDiving,35gp6d,Ashe400,3,Tue May 12 01:02:52 2015 UTC,Oh and grab any textbook you can find. Avoid those covered in gunk. We found about $150 worth this weekend. You can sell them to buy back websites. Find an app like bookstar that searches multiple sites.
DumpsterDiving,35gp6d,Ashe400,2,Tue May 12 01:10:53 2015 UTC,Central Michigan.
DumpsterDiving,35gp6d,TheTimeTravelersWife,3,Tue May 12 01:10:00 2015 UTC,"I would definitely NOT do what FrenzalRomb1 is suggesting. You're trespassing in the dorm building, and if you feel the need to use a disguise you probably don't need to be there. It seems deceptive. The stuff stacked at the end of the halls might be stuff the students are moving out of the room and leaving there til they can load it or something."
DumpsterDiving,35gp6d,DallasTruther,3,Sun May 10 19:55:41 2015 UTC,Sweet! Thanks! So I should physically go in to the dorms and not just look in the dumpsters?
DumpsterDiving,35gp6d,SpartanMonkey,7,Sun May 10 05:36:19 2015 UTC,"Don't trespass into the dorm. Don't search inside student areas.  Please follow the regular tip: if a dumpster is outside, it's fair game unless enclosed within some sort of barrier.   Disguises and DD'ing don't mix.  Neither does walking into a community center as if you reside there, and removing items.    This advice is dependent on what you mean by ""should."""
DumpsterDiving,35gp6d,HellbornElfchild,2,Sun May 10 06:31:08 2015 UTC,"That would really depend on the school/dorm. I just moved my daughter back home from her freshman year. If the door is left open more than a few seconds, an alarm starts going off."

DumpsterDiving,35gl92,IsThatWhatSheSaidTho,2,Fri May 15 01:01:04 2015 UTC,I'll also add that a lot of hotels are going through some remodels right now too so they have stuff they're throwing out. Specific ones that come to mind are the Mellinium and Alex Hotel both on Spenard near Lake Hood.
DumpsterDiving,35gl92,IsThatWhatSheSaidTho,2,Fri May 15 01:07:53 2015 UTC,"Not so sure, but you could check midtown around where the nicer homes and generally more walkable urban stuff is. At the moment it is garage sale time, so you could find some nice stuff for cheap, but I don't know about people just putting stuff out for free. I live in Anchorage myself obviously, and I have found that good furniture is hard to come by. People seem to try and get every penny out of every bit of furniture they can instead of just giving it away. This is why I would check the more well off places as they would be most likely to put stuff out for free being better positioned economically. Even so, they will probably still try to sell it to you, even if it is just a few dollars. I've only been living here a year and it has been very different from what I was used to living in a much larger city in the lower 48. Dumpster diving has been a hard nut to crack here.  I lived in Fairbanks a bit before I came here. That place was amazing for dumpster diving. You didn't even have to try very hard as everyone took their trash to one of two transfer stations, which was basically just a big muddy lot with dumpsters in it. There was even a covered area where people could dump stuff that they thought others might want to use. There would be clothes, furniture, books, kitchen appliances, all kinds of useful things. It definitely was a more sensible way of getting rid of trash as it gave everyone else easy access to something that could be reused.  I'm afraid you may have to settle for garage sales. This isn't a terrible thing though, as the transient nature of much of the people in Alaska means that every summer a whole bunch of people leave. Either they were there for military or some heavy industry or something, but they are going now and they sell off everything. I'm a bit of a snob and I've managed to get some excellent solid wood furniture(which is lucky as nobody here seems to give a shit about aesthetics. Seriously Alaskans will decorate their house in flimsy plastic lawn furniture as it's all the same to them)."
DumpsterDiving,35czj0,queeragnosticvegan,24,Sat May 9 03:00:26 2015 UTC,"..they dump at a CHURCH!? Would it kill them to make a few more steps, ring the door and DONATE the food there!?

DumpsterDiving,35czj0,AerisaFoxFeather,16,Sat May 9 04:14:40 2015 UTC,It is possible that church members are failing to donate these items and trashing them instead.
DumpsterDiving,35czj0,patchgrrl,8,Sat May 9 04:27:20 2015 UTC,"Stupid food safety laws most likely. At my church the city prohibited us from giving out any food to the homeless, unless it had come through the City's food bank. Places still tried to donate food directly to us, and we would pass on what we could to the food bank, but if it was something like what OP grabbed eg: fresh veggies, stuff that requires refrigeration, bread etc... by the time we got it and had made it ready to send to the food bank it was off temp, or already molding. It was unfortunate at the time because a lot of food ended up being wasted but eventually people have started to donate directly to the food bank. Also ""round about"" donations through other organizations still exist but only for non-perishables."
DumpsterDiving,35czj0,517634,2,Sat May 9 14:30:59 2015 UTC,... or perhaps the supply to the church just exceeded their demand?

I recently found this mens hair regrowth serum and sold just one of the serums inside of the still sealed box for 55$.

DumpsterDiving,3593wi,longjonesilver,6,Fri May 8 03:20:47 2015 UTC,find stuff students are throwing away now and trade for skateboard.
DumpsterDiving,3593wi,arbivark,4,Fri May 8 05:40:38 2015 UTC,"When I worked at a skateshop the only thing we ever tossed was literal trash, nothing that could be used. We were all skaters as well so anything damaged we couldn't sell one of us took to use. I'm assuming that would be the mentality of most people who work at them as well."
DumpsterDiving,3593wi,pxmatt,6,Fri May 8 14:12:42 2015 UTC,"The chances of them throwing away anything good (specifically sellable) are slim to none, of what I've heard they just throw out scraps of grip tape (the pieces that are cut off the edge) and just plain garbage."
DumpsterDiving,3593wi,scabdick,1 point,Fri May 8 03:47:31 2015 UTC,"Ok I skateboard and haven't ever checked the dumpsters of a Skateshop but I wouldn't see how anything good would be there. Your best bet would to ask some people at the skatepark for any old decks they have,( also check with your Local shop because sometimes depending on the shop  they give out old boards that people don't want or at a lower price or something) The Deck is the easy part to get what is hard is The trucks, bearings and wheels. Not many people are willing to give you those so they'll probably cost you around 70 or 80$ the non deck part of the skateboard really lasts for I would say 4 years or longer so it's a good investment.  In my own case I went to the skatepark made friends with the people there and got a deck and then just bought the rest of the gear.  Hope that helps."
DumpsterDiving,3593wi,TheRedPlum,1 point,Fri May 8 17:40:58 2015 UTC,"learn to resell on ebay then you will have $. Just clear out some junk you already have. As for diving a skateboard shop, probably will net you zero but it is definitely worth a check. Your best bet is if something gets returned and tossed and you are able to fix the defect somehow."

DumpsterDiving,356lok,charverine,5,Thu May 7 15:34:30 2015 UTC,I would say no because most likely what happened is their power went out and the food thawed and was refrozen so they threw it out.

DumpsterDiving,3528lg,Aladayle,2,Thu May 7 02:13:39 2015 UTC,I suspect they would let you off with a warning before doing a formal arrest. Maybe they are looking specifically for people who make a mess or are taking scrap metals which may be a crime in your area.

DumpsterDiving,3528lg,anonwithpaneer,3,Wed May 6 17:26:13 2015 UTC,I live in a very bike friendly city so bikes often show up in dumpsters or on the curb. They ussually just need a little TLC to get them running. My last cool bike find was an 80s vintage Peugeot racing bike. Gave it to a bike tech friend and he sold it almost immediately and we split the cash.
DumpsterDiving,3528lg,weirdal1968,2,Thu May 7 00:16:19 2015 UTC,It's probably worth checking if they are stolen first though... could be an owner looking for his bike.
DumpsterDiving,3528lg,elongated_smiley,1 point,Thu May 7 09:55:36 2015 UTC,He checks every bike when he gets it but still gets burned once in a while because stolen bikes get dumped in the suburbs which are under a different police dept.  The Peugeot had enough basement funk in the frame to prove it had been in storage for years.
DumpsterDiving,3528lg,weirdal1968,2,Thu May 7 18:01:50 2015 UTC,"Ok, I'm  not sure where you live. Maybe there's a national bike registry for stolen bikes."
DumpsterDiving,3528lg,elongated_smiley,9,Thu May 7 18:51:23 2015 UTC,"Not sure if this counts because it wasn't necessarily in a dumpster but in the trash...  Found about 100 old comic books, late 80s early 90s I think. All wrapped in plastic and never opened (by me).  Put it up on Kijiji and someone offered $900 for it but I think I'll just hold on to them for a while. They might even be worth nothing though!"

Honestly they had never crossed my mind but I know everytime I go to the Targets near me there are always employees at the CS Desk or otherwise nearby. I can't imagine getting 15 seconds in the bin without drawing attention let alone enough time to check anything is working or not.

DumpsterDiving,3528lg,AvieLikesThis,4,Tue May 12 06:12:58 2015 UTC,"My best hauls were from college. I was a non-traditional (NT, read: almost 30) student on a campus with a mix of NT and regular college students in 2004-2007. The NT students were financially conservative, brought bottled water or coffee in travel mugs from home/convenience store. Regular students usually bought everything from vending on campus.  This attitude carried over to everything the regular students did. They didn't want it or were 'finished' with it, they tossed it out. Luckily, classroom trash cans were usually very clean, with only paper in them. So I would check between classes, and found notebooks with only a few sheets torn out, practically brand-new binders, sometimes even money. (The money was usually crumpled in a receipt from the bookstore, or a nearby restaurant.)  MyCokeRewards started during this time, and I went nuts, grabbing any and every bottle cap I could find. During campus events, I'd get the 12 pack codes.   I think the best finds were the freebies being handed out at campus events. I ended up with a box full of tampon samples, from one event, and travel sized cans of Axe from another. They were donated for promotional consideration and once people decided they didn't want them, I asked Student Affairs what they were going to do with them, and once they said they would throw them away, I took them off their hands.  As you can note from the posts here on /r/DumpsterDiving, college is usually some of the best pickings."

DumpsterDiving,350smr,CyanWolf96,0,Thu May 7 03:19:39 2015 UTC,"Yeah, what I've done is started really going through the dumpsters that I know have stuff in them. Try electronic repair shops. I found a ps3, macbook, and a working tablet tonight with a few GPS systems and external DVD drives."
DumpsterDiving,350smr,glooberz,1 point,Thu May 7 03:22:28 2015 UTC,"Honestly for me I honestly feel it is what exact town or city you decide to do this in. I have been to numerous towns where they wasn't anything to find for weeks. However there were other ones where I was pretty much guaranteed to bring home at least something. So I would just do my research and explore some different town that are near your home. Granted this will cost gas money and time but it may be worth the plunge.   Certain stores will pay out and certain ones will NEVER EVER have anything. Like my best buy for example, never has anything at all."
DumpsterDiving,350smr,DeMiDeViL1,-1,Sat May 9 03:04:45 2015 UTC,"If you want to find good stuff without having to dive every day find the schedule of garbage day for the location. I come the last day when it's OVERLOADED, and the top usually has the most meh stuff, my vitamin shoppe haul in the thread before was all the way in the bottom in a sealed box. Just get some DD clothes, I bought some 99 cents worker gloves that work swell! I wouldn't dive chain restaurants because of the foul smell, the worse kind of smell I have to really go through is expired throw out coffee which is quite sickening. But with the up coming heat it's almost better to check daily if you're going for food because you don't want a bag of overheated dumpster goodness :D.   Why I love dumpster diving, it's Christmas every week and  I never celebrated Christmas haha."

DumpsterDiving,34v1uy,carputt,3,Mon May 4 23:28:19 2015 UTC,Car transponders are passive and don't require a battery.
DumpsterDiving,34v1uy,subtlefarts,2,Tue May 5 01:47:33 2015 UTC,"Transponders are powered by the receiver, not a battery in the key. The remote would be dead, but not the key."
DumpsterDiving,34v1uy,mdneilson,1 point,Tue May 5 00:49:26 2015 UTC,Do car keys really have both a traditional manual key and a transponder? This car key looks a little old to have a transponder in any case.
DumpsterDiving,34v1uy,modernbenoni,2,Mon May 4 23:31:09 2015 UTC,Nearly every car since 2000 have transponders in the key. I think you're confusing transponders with keyless entry transmitters.

Lets check out the car places maybe they threw out ....a....car....or something"" Realizing as I said it how idiotic that was.

At natural grocers I found some really cool organic stuff like pro bacteria pills and extra virgin coconut oil. The shopko is no good, the walgreens is no good because they have like 10 foot fences around the dumpsters, the hyvee is no good, I was thinking about checking the hyvee gas station dumpster, what do you think about that? Neither trader joes or whole foods looked promising, and whole foods is definitely out. I think there might be a staples on dodge. Game stop is no good... I don't know, I'm just gonna keep hitting up ALDI when I'm in the area and natural grocers about once a week. I might take a look at the vitamin superstore though, I don't know why I didn't think of that. And what's at the CVS? I didn't check there.."

Everything below is too old. I try to dive only on days that were a bit colder or cloudy, not on sunny 30°C days.  I definitely dive less often in summer because it's just more unpleasant.

I started bringing pens and stuff of that shape, to stick in the knot in the garbage bag to get it to open quickly without tearing. i feel like i'm on the verge of inventing a useful tool but I'm not there yet (still takes too long)."
DumpsterDiving,34ozlv,Jamesfire,3,Sun May 3 14:41:13 2015 UTC,"Just rip the bags open but not so much that all the contents spill out. When you are done checking contents, flip the bag over so the non ripped side is up. Less likely anyone will notice your rummaging. Also, you could simply dive on the night of pickup. Rip as you like since the whole dumpster will be emptied before employees are back."
DumpsterDiving,34ozlv,mywan,2,Sun May 3 23:33:51 2015 UTC,Dumpster diving is legal with few exceptions. Littering is not legal. I rip bags open and make my living on the cans mostly. I also bring my own broom and dustpan and get on good terms with the managers and maintance people. I make myself quiet visible and work with any issues they might have. I do quiet well this way.
DumpsterDiving,34ozlv,mywan,1 point,Sun May 3 11:23:04 2015 UTC,If the dumpster if well off the road the business can choose to trespass you but can't do anything about it short of that. If its in the road right of way then they can't even do that. But it's best to be as accommodating as is reasonable regardless of legalities.

DumpsterDiving,34ozlv,starrynightgirl,1 point,Sun May 3 16:42:00 2015 UTC,Plastic cans and water bottles sometime have a 5 cents refund if you return them to a place that recycles them (you pay a 5 cents deposit at the store and you get it back if you return them to a place that accepts them to recycle instead of trashing them) most people trash them. You still need to acquire lots of cans for it to be economically viable. A New York Times report says that most people who do that full time make at or below minimum wage.

DumpsterDiving,34ozlv,weirdal1968,2,Mon May 4 00:38:49 2015 UTC,During summer moves along my route sometimes the dumpster areas get absolutely TRASHED. Just so I don't get blamed for the mess sometimes I'll toss stuff in the rear of the dumpster when the front is full. Apparently nobody thinks of that. One time a resident walked in on me cleaning up and absolutely FREAKED and apologized over and over. I guess she thought I was a groundskeeper and was going to report her for the mess. It was hard keeping a straight face.

DumpsterDiving,34ml7g,arbivark,-2,Wed May 6 00:26:14 2015 UTC,"it would be a bit like if they through away checks. if they think, foolishly, that throwing something away is like destroying it, they werent trying to make you a gift of the card.   one time i had cops called on me at a store dumpster, and one of their talking points was that if i got stuff from their dumpster, maybe i would bring it back in for a refund.  of course i would neer do that, but they dont know that. to me taking a gift cad from the store dumpster would be too much like that. one time i found what would have been, oh maybe $30K of gift cards, but they werent activated. (so yes, i checked.)"

No, they're not painted or dyed! Purple cauliflower gets its beautiful hue, which can vary from pale to jewel-toned, from the presence of the antioxidant anthocyanin, which is also found in red cabbage and red wine.  Orange cauliflower was first discovered in Canada in 1970, although it took years of crossbreeding before it was widely available. The color comes from a genetic mutation that allows the plant to hold more beta carotene. It also contains about 25% more vitamin A than white cauliflower."

I found lots of furniture, some games, and lots of text books (mostly written in so less for resale value). Def. worth a check."

They put one of those shallow (~4 feet high) roll-off bins somewhere near each set of dorms and let everyone dump their stuff into there.  It's handy for us divers because if need be, we can jump in and jump right out!  Over the past day of diving, I've found three printers, a damaged microwave, a few textbooks, gospel CDs, a poker Xbox game, a couple of unmentionables, a Shark vacuum, a shallow bookshelf in nice shape, some brand-new notebooks...and a slightly bent-up metal handtruck!  I gave the electronics to a guy in my dorm hallway who tears them apart and sells the innards, he has more use for them than I do.  Yes...all that, in 24 hours. It's incredible.

When I started, I made a list of stores that carried products I would be interested in recovering, then surveyed those store's locations in my area and record what type of dumpster they have, if there are obvious cameras around, etc. I avoid stores that have compactors, as they are typically locked for liability reasons (so divers/employees/etc gets compacted accidentally...) and the compactors most commonly ruin whatever they compact.  It's pretty much a game of consistency. If you swing at 1,000,000 pitches, you're going to hit the ball eventually. If you check 1,000,000 dumpsters, odds are you'll find something you consider worth your time--eventually."

The N64 controller broke my heart, literally the only thing that seems to be wrong with it is the joystick which can be replaced so easily, but yet they cut the cord for it. I hope I can splice the wires and salvage it.  The posters are in mixed shape, the folded display boxes are significantly better for sure. The Splatoon display has a few punched holes, so I might hang it up, but the Star Wars one has three pretty nasty creases in the center. Still looks nice from afar though.  And finally dog treats. My buddy and I don't normally check the pet stores, but figured we were in the area.

Great game, vehicle-based combat with a variety of classes, powers, weapons, and customizations for your vehicle. It even utilized (then new) nVidia PhysX. When it was launched, New accounts were given their first month for free. During that time they were doing a promo with W00t Radio, and I won a swag pack from a trivia contest. The game was a lot of fun, and had a lot of potential. I miss it sometimes."

With all of my finds my friends all have huge bags of dog food(even stuff like Blue Buffalo) and I have a 60 lb tub full of expensive cat food.  I've even found litter for our cats.  It's a normal thing for stores to chuck them if they get nicked or ripped.  They can't ""guarantee"" safety so they chuck.  Having to do so at a grocery chain I worked at made me realize the potential haul."

DumpsterDiving,342dbp,akavino,14,Mon Apr 27 19:34:54 2015 UTC,"90% of the time when stores change to a lockbar, it isn't to keep people from taking stuff out, but to keep anyone from putting stuff in. Lots of places have problems with people throwing tvs/matresses/whatever in dumpsters, and the customer is the one getting charged overage fees. Most stores don't go back to non-locking cans after the switch. Wind is the less common reason, but it's not unheard of depending on the area.  As some people on this thread said, check occasionally to see if the bar is actually locked or just shut. Employees will even leave the lock in place but unlocked (hanging open on the bar) so they don't have to unlock it every time.  Please don't take others' advice to bend the lockbar or the lids. These are paying customers and refuse businesses just doing their jobs. Damaging their property to get stuff out is pretty rude to both parties, regardless of whether what's in the trash should be put to better use or not."
DumpsterDiving,342dbp,MrTrashSalesmanToYou,3,Mon Apr 27 21:15:20 2015 UTC,"You can keep an eye out for when the employees get lazy and don't lock it, or leave the dumpster lids ajar from the lock bar.  At that point it's fair game.  That said, it they just switched dumpsters, it may be a while before they get that lax...."
DumpsterDiving,342dbp,Blues2112,3,Mon Apr 27 20:22:19 2015 UTC,"I find that after a while the employees get lazy and start leaving it unlocked, so just keep an eye out. Does suck though."
DumpsterDiving,342dbp,Scraplington,2,Tue Apr 28 01:12:01 2015 UTC,Lame sauce. From what ive seen once a lock goes on they tend to stay on atleast for a while.
DumpsterDiving,342dbp,charverine,1 point,Mon Apr 27 19:54:05 2015 UTC,"Right after my friends and I started diving, someone vandalized dumpsters at the two Dollar Generals in our town. We were pretty sure the stores knew we were doing it, and until then they didn't mind. Someone snapped the lids in half to get into them the one day out of ten that they happened to be locked. That happened at both stores. For about two weeks they had two dumpsters at each store, the new ones being locked and without the nice side slots or lids loose enough to even peek in. Luckily for us they reverted back to the old dumpster at one store, but not the other. I'd say there's a chance the old one could come back, but it's probably situational and still unlikely. Don't give up hope, but don't let it get you down either."
DumpsterDiving,342dbp,Future_Visions,5,Tue Apr 28 01:01:57 2015 UTC,Your alibi weakens if you get caught breaking into a locked dumpster. I try to avoid bins that aren't open and welcoming
DumpsterDiving,342dbp,EricDotW,-3,Mon Apr 27 20:21:59 2015 UTC,"Yes, give these a shot. A lot of times the back bar has a pin holding it in place, and the pin needs to be bent into a straight line for removal. You can bend it with a pair of pliers or your hands if you're willing to take the time and possibly hurt your fingers. After you're done, replace the bar and pin and from then on you can access the dumpster without damaging it (except the pin but it still functions), and can go in and out without a trace.  Edit: words"
DumpsterDiving,342dbp,yes2plants,3,Mon Apr 27 22:03:07 2015 UTC,"Some diver(or illegal dumper) did that where I used to work and didn't replace the pin,when the dumpster got emptied the lid fell off into the garbage truck. No one was happy and work then had people staking out the area to prevent trespassing and ensuring the bin was always locked and eventually moved into a sealed shed because they kept getting vandalised. Don't modify the bin, it's locked let it go."
DumpsterDiving,342dbp,wordplayar,-1,Mon Apr 27 21:16:56 2015 UTC,"Some diver(or illegal dumper) did that where I used to work and didn't replace the pin ... Don't modify the bin, it's locked let it go.   Or you can be a considerate diver and make sure to replace the pin.   It's pretty easy to say ""let it go"" if there are lots of good unlocked dumpsters in your area. But if you're somewhere where they're all locked, and not pulling the pin is the difference between eating fresh produce or not, it's not such an easy decision.   Just be careful and courteous, as always."

DumpsterDiving,33wg6y,The_Wanderer_Xain,2,Sun Apr 26 07:41:04 2015 UTC,"I routinely hit a pet store dumpster and a retro gaming store dumpster on my way home from work.  I have boxes of things I've picked up(they seem to push new cords/controllers rather than first party) but this is by far my best haul from the game store to date.  I usually jump into their dumpster because they share it with an aquarium shop, a frozen yogurt spot and a tanning salon without a lot of messy trash if there's any in the bin at all.  Somebody else has been able to get to their bags first lately since I get out of work at 11pm and my trip back across town to get home takes about 30-45 minutes but I figure they're inspired by YouTube vids because they never take any of the older retro stuff and cords I look for.  So tonight I roll up to the dumpster and find the remains of their trash dumped into the front left side of the dumpster(it's open on the left side because I started opening it, it's how I know if somebody else has been there recently) but since they sometimes throw out bigger items(they cleared out Rock Bands and Guitar Hero last week) I looked over to the right.  Box of games.  Whoever else is competing with me didn't spot the box of games sitting on the right side of the bin.  The loose cords are Wii component, Wii sensor bar, an Xbox component and a N64 AC adapter.  The only caveat is that the box smells like dog, which is why it got chucked.  The games are already outside sealed in a bin with a box of baking soda.  The Destiny trapezoid thing is a 3D cardboard stand topper where the characters are layered onto it.  Detail-less photo because I wasn't thinking about showing it off when I snapped it.  I found it chucked into the compactor at my apartment complex a couple of nights ago and since I'm a fan of the game and a collector, I snagged it.  Don't know if I'll keep it or offer it up to somebody that has the space."

DumpsterDiving,33vd5u,Future_Visions,2,Sun Apr 26 00:03:30 2015 UTC,"Last weekend a few good friends traveled with my to my home town just so we could get away from campus for a night. While in town, we decided to go diving, since my town is larger than the one we go to school in. During the last leg of our adventure, we met other divers. This was only the second time this has happened to me. The first time, an older man beat me to a dumpster and was pretty polite regarding his luck that night, but he kept to himself. This time was a little weirder. It was late, about 2:30 and we were at the last strip mall. There were four of us, two in the truck, and two riding on the running board. We were slowly making our way down the back road when I saw a flashlight bobbing around. We made our way closer because nothing discourages us. I hopped down and walked toward the other divers. Let's call the driver ""Crazy Eyes"" for her especially lazy eye, and ""Leather Tits"" for her low cut shirt and severe need to find lotion in those dumpsters. I asked Leather Tits if they had found anything or had anything to trade. She promptly said no and hopped in the truck. I told her that the next dumpster down had produce if they were looking for food. She shot back some sarcastic remark like ""Ohh yeah that's what we're lookin' for."" Crazy Eyes' window and our driver's window had lined up and the conversation went something like this: ""How old are you kids?"" ""19."" ""You's just a baby. Why you trash pickin'? Do y'all do drugs?"" Then they sped off. It was pretty obvious that they were tweakers once we got closer, and they only had two large, used mattresses in their truck. (Disgusting.) Has anyone else had such an experience with less than pleasant people while diving? I'd love to hear some stories."

DumpsterDiving,33nowb,FriscoGuy,2,Fri Apr 24 04:52:49 2015 UTC,"Well the keys in OP's picture are tubular lock keys, but I've used a regular sentry safe key on more than one and it worked.  They're all keyed alike or similar enough that it will move the mechanism enough to open the lid. Either way the mechanism is incredibly easy to destroy."
DumpsterDiving,33nowb,bretstar,2,Fri Apr 24 15:27:23 2015 UTC,Tubular keys are mostly skeleton keys. And seeing how this is a fire safe and not a regular safe (which often are fireproof) it's pobably just a key lock to make it less likely that unwelcomed people will look through your stuff. The key lock is probably more likely to stay closed during a fire as well.
DumpsterDiving,33nowb,8mmphilosopher,2,Fri Apr 24 16:39:25 2015 UTC,I see. I just think it's funny people think these are safes.
DumpsterDiving,33nowb,Love_Indubitably,4,Fri Apr 24 16:51:24 2015 UTC,So what was inside?
DumpsterDiving,33nowb,tallornot,5,Fri Apr 24 01:51:51 2015 UTC,Nothing.
DumpsterDiving,33nowb,Love_Indubitably,11,Fri Apr 24 02:08:46 2015 UTC,At least OP delivered.
DumpsterDiving,33nowb,Guitarjake921,10,Fri Apr 24 04:00:42 2015 UTC,"if only they wrote ""Defective"" on the packaging only and not the actual safe (-_-)"
DumpsterDiving,33nowb,Vaelzan,11,Fri Apr 24 01:31:33 2015 UTC,One of those eraser things will take it right off.
DumpsterDiving,33nowb,Guitarjake921,9,Fri Apr 24 01:32:13 2015 UTC,Rubbing alcohol is also pretty good for removing permanent marker!
DumpsterDiving,33nowb,brizzyy,2,Fri Apr 24 04:00:28 2015 UTC,"Acetone is really good. I work in a chem lab and use permanent marker to mark flasks and such all the time. I clean everything with water then acetone, the acetone takes of the permanent marker with almost no wiping! You can get a bottle of acetone at a home improvement store for super cheap."
DumpsterDiving,33nowb,chybaby7,2,Fri Apr 24 04:31:39 2015 UTC,"Only problem is that Acetone can melt some surfaces. It's great on glass or metal, but beware with plastic or painted surfaces.  Got the right surface to use it on though and it's amazing stuff. I use it to strip paint off metal Warhammer models and they come up clean in a minute or less."
DumpsterDiving,33nowb,GeorgeAmberson,1 point,Fri Apr 24 10:45:22 2015 UTC,"If you put a little acetone on a paper towel and rub the plastic surface, it should be fine."
DumpsterDiving,33nowb,weirdal1968,2,Fri Apr 24 15:13:56 2015 UTC,"or in the nail polish section, it might be more expensive per gallon but a bottle is still only about $2. Especially if storage is a issue or if you dont use it regularly."
DumpsterDiving,33nowb,ccosby,1 point,Fri Apr 24 12:19:08 2015 UTC,"Or hand sanitizer. I have to take marker off stuff all the time (retail and and people dont want writting on the box, wants discount). Works like a charm."
DumpsterDiving,33nowb,ccosby,2,Fri Apr 24 13:12:00 2015 UTC,Basically the same thing.  Ethanol instead of isopropyl though.  Same solvent qualities.
DumpsterDiving,33nowb,carlsnakeston,1 point,Fri Apr 24 16:32:34 2015 UTC,For removing adhesives/paint markers without damaging the surface lighter fluid is the go-to solvent. Alcohol and acetone can easily destroy any decals/lettering on surfaces depending on how fragile they are.
DumpsterDiving,33nowb,TankSpank,2,Sat Apr 25 18:14:39 2015 UTC,A dry erase marker will remove the marker as well. Run the dry erase marker over the existing marker than wipe both off.
DumpsterDiving,33nowb,KptKrondog,1 point,Fri Apr 24 13:02:34 2015 UTC,Thanks! I'll try it later
DumpsterDiving,33nowb,Ay_u_wan_sum_fuk,1 point,Fri Apr 24 13:44:09 2015 UTC,I've done this a lot with permeant marker in the past. We use marker to tag work machines. If someone buys an old one being trashed I remove the inventory number this way. Might take more than one try but usually works really well. Afterwards just wipe off any residue with a wet paper towel.
