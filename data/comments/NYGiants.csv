NYGiants,3e2886,tercra,3,Tue Jul 21 11:50:44 2015 UTC,"1)  Rookie contracts cannot be renegotiated until after the player's 3rd year  2)  Teams just can't just choose to negotiate contract extensions when it is convenient or advantageous to them.  The player has to be a willing participant in these kinds of things.  (And the players know full well when the team's leverage is high or low, and what they can expect in terms of salary cap growth.)"

Hopefully it's saved somewhere and I'll find it next time I move.  What.  A.  Game.  I still remember just being amazed thinking that we were really there and holding our own - we made them 'bleed' that night, and then there was no fear at the super bowl.    Thanks for the good memories!"
NYGiants,3dz79d,ccomm1,8,Mon Jul 20 19:34:47 2015 UTC,"I had the exact same experience.  As you said, the Giants made them bleed that night. I had to leave that game a little early, so I left as soon as they lost the lead, but I still remember being irrationally confident the Giants would beat the Patriots if they played again.  Seasons like 07-08 make every other year worth it."
NYGiants,3dz79d,50_shades_of_winning,3,Mon Jul 20 21:32:45 2015 UTC,"I was working with a patriots fan and he was so smug going into the playoffs that year... I remember say ""watch out, we're coming for you"". He didn't believe me at the time."

NYGiants,3dz79d,boobers3,7,Mon Jul 20 20:09:42 2015 UTC,Biggest half time defect that Pats team faced all season if I recall. Just couldn't hold on. Made the Super Bowl all that much more special though.

NYGiants,3dz79d,meerkulture,2,Mon Jul 20 21:27:40 2015 UTC,"True. But. Imagine how much the patriots would be our bitch if we ended their historic season in the regular season and then went on to beat them AGAIN in the sb. And then won another sb against them. Shit, they might be called the New England Giants at that point."
NYGiants,3dz79d,etweetz,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:08:53 2015 UTC,I think they would have taken the Giants much more seriously in the SB had they lost the regular season finale. You could see by their play that the Pats were not expecting to get punched in the mouth the way they did in the SB.
NYGiants,3dz79d,boobers3,6,Wed Jul 22 00:44:24 2015 UTC,"I was there too. That game was the one that made John Madden call Coughlin with this message:   Just called to congratulate you and your team for a great effort last night. Not good, but great. I think it's one of the best things to happen in the NFL in the last ten years, and I don't know if they all know it, but they should be very grateful to you and your team for what you did. I believe so firmly in this: that there is only one way to play the game, and it is a regular season game and you go out and win the darn game. I was just so proud being a part of the NFL and of what your guys did and the way you did it. You proved that it's a game and there's only one way to play the game and you did it. The NFL needed it. We've gotten too much of, ""Well, they're going to rest their players and don't need to win, therefore they won't win."" Well, that's not sports and that's not competition. I'm a little emotional about it. I'm just so proud. It's something we all need to thank you for, and I believe the NFL needed that."""

NYGiants,3dzz8d,TheCowgirlCrusher,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:28:26 2015 UTC,"I am in a debate and my argument is that Hill is not a top 5 safety. The opposition posted that PFF chart as his proof and I am saying stats don't tell the whole picture, even PFF's."
NYGiants,3dzz8d,TheCowgirlCrusher,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:30:29 2015 UTC,How did he do last year?
NYGiants,3dzz8d,TheCowgirlCrusher,3,Mon Jul 20 22:31:29 2015 UTC,"In my opinion he was fine. My case is that he is a fine safety, but that the stats make him look better then he really is. I wanted this fan bases opinion on if they felt Hill was a top 5 safety in 2013, or not. I personally don't think he was ever a top 5 safety when there have been guys like Thomas, Chancellor, Weddle, McCourty, and Smith being more impactful. Would you consider his 2013 enough to consider him a top 5 safety?"
NYGiants,3dzz8d,dagaboy,3,Mon Jul 20 22:36:54 2015 UTC,"Just cuz he was a beast who played hard and was never out of position. He would blow up runningbacks in the backfield before they got started, he blew receivers up without drawing flags, he allowed hardly any yards after the catch for receivers he was responsible for, he was responsible with his field assignments, his tracking skills were excellent and he could get passed multiple blockers to the ball carrier, and I remember he forced turnovers with both interceptions and forced fumbles when he got chances. The only thing he didn't really seem to do was blitz, and that was because it would be a waste to have our deep threat deterrent blitzing. I don't know many safeties that can do all of that consistently."
NYGiants,3dzz8d,dagaboy,2,Mon Jul 20 22:53:25 2015 UTC,"I did not keep up with him last year, but yes he was amazing in 2013. Even as a rookie he was clearly a rare talent. He has a keen football mind and was never out of position. He outplayed Stevie Brown by a wide margin, despite Brown's 8 interceptions that year. Mostly, as a rookie, he played slot/nickel, and had no trouble in man coverage on slot receivers. In 2013 he got to play more safety and he was a beast. His ceiling is crazy high."
NYGiants,3dzz8d,50_shades_of_winning,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:53:50 2015 UTC,"I agree that he has a high ceiling. He is still young. My argument is that he isn't top 5 right now. Sure there is definitly a possibility that he does reach that but I don't see it right now. What I see is a guy slowly rising up and right now just around the Top 10. The Safeties I think are better then him are guys like Weddle, ET3, Kam, McCourty, Harrison Smith, Glover Quinn, Gipson, and maybe Bethea. His upside is crazy."
NYGiants,3dzz8d,50_shades_of_winning,2,Tue Jul 21 00:58:19 2015 UTC,"Like I said, I didn't see him last year. But I was not shocked when PFF rated him second to McCourty in coverage in 2013. He was that good. What really amazed me was his performance in man over the slot. Of course, before he came to the NFL Ray Buchanan (who coached him privately) said he had the cover skills of an NFL corner. I also would not be surprised if he wasn't as good last year. Short season in a new system, etc.   EDIT: 2013 highlights."
NYGiants,3dzz8d,beyerself,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:30:20 2015 UTC,"Obviously stats don't tell the whole picture, but that's why you put his production in context.   I feel like this goes without saying, but safety is two positions, free safety and strong safety. Will Hill is a free safety. Will Hill had a bunch of off the field problems, including some hilarious tweets, and was signed for basically nothing as a why not he's really talented kind of thing.  Fast forward to 2013, I don't remember the exact duration, but Will Hill started the season suspended, so his snap count is lower than most people on that list. The Giants' defense was struggling badly, until Will Hill and Jon Beason entered the lineup, and I would actually say the defense became the strength of the team soon after that.   Will Hill had off the field issues, was cut, and was signed by the Ravens at vet min. He had to learn a new system, but he started the season late again because of suspension. He had a very solid year, not as strong as 2013, but he played a more demanding role.  TL;DR: He's had a lot of off the field problems, but I think he has the talent to become a top five FS. He's not there yet, but he definitely has the talent, and he's an absolute steal at vet min."
NYGiants,3dzz8d,EliTheGod,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:11:11 2015 UTC,I agree very much so. I am going to hijack this post by giving a shout out to /u/outphase84 He backed up what he believed with stats and I commend him on the great debate. I hope there are no hard feelings just love to debate about football! Hill is a great player and will hopefully reach that top 5 spot very soon because we know he can. Go Ravens!
NYGiants,3dzz8d,3rdAnnual,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:39:51 2015 UTC,"No problem. I'm not sure my opinion ends the debate, because only time will tell. I do think he will develop into a top 5 FS in Baltimore though. I guess I'm slightly biased though, because I like Will Hill and I see the Ravens as the Giants of the AFC."
NYGiants,3dzz8d,SevenwithaT,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:35:33 2015 UTC,Thanks man! I think he can be a top 5 safety but I think saying it based off his current body of work is too premature. I am from CT so I actually watch a ton of Giants games. You guys have a very interesting roster this year. Almost like a Boom or Meh. Either a very good season or just the middle of the pack 7-9 > 6-10. I am hoping for a 10-6 year for you guys.
NYGiants,3dzz8d,HowYaGuysDoin,3,Tue Jul 21 11:41:16 2015 UTC,"The guy is a flat out football player. He's one of those guys that the game definitely comes natural to. I remember when he got playing time for the GMEN he looked like the best player on field. He's just an absolute moron.   There's a rumor that right before he got cut, he was renting in West Orange, NJ. He literally played paintball in the house with his friends and then refused to pay for all the damages that ensued.   I mean, seriously?  But yeah, he's a stud on the field."
NYGiants,3dyqzb,Izcila,13,Mon Jul 20 16:58:44 2015 UTC,"Stay in NJ. Couple decent hotels nearby, around $175-200 a night. Call them and book earlier for a discount if I were you.

NYGiants,3dyqzb,SaxySwag,3,Mon Jul 20 19:18:14 2015 UTC,You wouldn't even need to go that far south. You could definitely find a nice/cheap hotel in Essex County that would be 10-15 min from the stadium.

NYGiants,3dyqzb,nyg1,2,Tue Jul 21 09:44:48 2015 UTC,"i take public transportation into NYC every day from a couple towns over and its very easy.   The easiest way would be to just take a cab to Secaucus Junction (Train station)  and taking the train to NY penn station. It will drop you off at Madison Square Garden at 34th street and 8th avenue.  If you want to take a bus the 163 line (there are others, this is just the one i know) goes through East Rutherford straight to Port Authority Bus Terminal, which will drop you off at 40th street and 8th avenue.  Edit: This also works pretty well"

With my business travels, I have stayed at other Extended Stay America Hotels and have not been disappointed.  I am very happy that a dedicated fan (all the way from Norway) is coming to MetLife to cheer for Big Blue.  Enjoy the game!!  The particular details for this hotel is as follows:  Extended Stay America - Meadowlands - East Rutherford  300 State Highway Route 3 East, East Rutherford 07073  Telephone:  (201) 939-8866"

NYGiants,3dyqzb,hijinks,3,Tue Jul 21 14:57:38 2015 UTC,"Hmmm.  I wouldn't recommend going to Dallas or staying in Philadelphia.  If you're coming all the way from Norway, you probably want to experience New York City.    Have you looked at hotel discount sites like Hotwire?  Have you looked at the cheaper areas of NYC for hotels, like Long Island City, Brooklyn and the Financial District?  Or, what about doing an Airbnb?"
NYGiants,3dyqzb,hijinks,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:54:33 2015 UTC,"I've already experienced NYC, so thats not so important now. I just wanna go there for MetLife again. But yes, I can't say that Dallas is one of the city's that's on top of my list of city's I want to visit, haha.. Yes, they have a nice stadium, but what more could I do in the city?   I will check out the areas like Long Island City, Brooklyn and Financial District! The most important for me, is to get a quite ""cheap"" room, and it should be comfortable, but also I need the taxi og bus to be easy and cheap from my hotel to the city and MetLife."
NYGiants,3dyqzb,streetfish,2,Tue Jul 21 10:32:54 2015 UTC,"Oh, well if you are simply visiting to see the game, stay in New Jersey.  There's a Hilton, Hampton Inn and a few other chain hotels right near the Stadium.  That would save you a cab ride to the game.  If it was me, I would stay at the Hampton Inn right near the stadium.  It won't be fancy, but Hampton Inns are usually run pretty well, they have free breakfast and they have nice beds.  Or, if it were me, I might want to go to Miami for the Dec 14 Monday night game.  Winter in Norway and all, right?"
NYGiants,3dyqzb,Camehereavl,3,Tue Jul 21 16:58:41 2015 UTC,NYC explodes from late November to Christmas with tourism so most hotels are pretty expensive then. Your best bet is probably October to mid November for pricing. If you don't care on the place you stay you can try priceline.com and pick an area and name your price and see if that works.

But this year, every hotel seems to be a lot more expensive. Maybe it's because of the Norwegian Krone is so weak now. Last year I payed 6NOK for 1$, but now I have to pay 8NOK for 1$..   I'll check out princeline.com too. Never heard about them.."

NYGiants,3dt2m8,HowYaGuysDoin,51,Sun Jul 19 04:38:31 2015 UTC,All I read are stupid finger puns about JPP
NYGiants,3dt2m8,SevenwithaT,19,Sun Jul 19 04:44:04 2015 UTC,"It's half finger puns and half threads stating that anyone who doesn't have full confidence in JPP's ability to dominate post-maiming is a terrible fan.  I personally think we should be outraged at this guy. When Josh Gordon got wrongfully suspended for smoking a little pot (pretty much the most harmless thing currently banned in the NFL aside from celebrations), Giant fans couldn't get enough of talking about how he was soooo dumb and how it was all his stupid fault for electing to break a law when the team relied on him.   JPP bought a van full of illegal fireworks and blew bis hand up. What a fucking idiot."
NYGiants,3dt2m8,AtlasRodeo,3,Sun Jul 19 10:56:51 2015 UTC,"Agreed. He's fucking stupid and unless he has 15 sacks this year, we should let him walk. I don't think he's been all that great. He shows flashes of being the best DE in the league, but he's not consistent enough to be $15 mil"
NYGiants,3dt2m8,_ShutThatBabyUp,24,Sun Jul 19 19:25:43 2015 UTC,"Well, to be fair... The last couple of season's we haven't know which JPP we had until game day - each week he was different. Not gonna lie, before the loss of his finger, before his contract hold out, before last season, I had serious questions about his value to the team.   Previous to the 2014 season, I was willing to give him a pass due to his injuries. Back and shoulder issues are no joke. He deserved the chance to prove he was still something special.   But, most of last year, he was inconsistent. He did not always seem to be in the game mentally - and that caused me to reevaluate his actual production throughout his career.  Frankly speaking, JPP's production were a direct result of his teammate. When he was a force to be reckoned with,  Tuck and Usi were out there. They drew the attention and the special blocks. The main play that elevated his was the blocked kick that got us to the playoffs in 2011. But seriously, that's about all he has done.   Quote stats all you like, but the reality is that he is only an above average Defensive End. He's nothing special. No Strahan, definitely not a Watt. Yet he wants to be paid as if he is.   Now he's injured, without a contract. He has not shown good faith this entire off season. The injury and his reaction highlight that fact. I think we need to seriously reevaluate the franchise tag. Pull it. If he wants to test the market, I say let him. Maybe it will open his eyes a bit and bring him back to reality. Then he can start working on being part of a team, rather than focused on himself. Team first, everything else will fall into place."
NYGiants,3dt2m8,BigBlueWookiee,4,Sun Jul 19 06:19:07 2015 UTC,"That was the conclusion I drew as well. I think the countervailing point is that:   If he does sign you can nfi him for the time he doesn't play. If he doesn't sign it, the cap space all comes back and gets rolled over anyways, but he can't go and sign with any team. You don't get the cap space now... But how are you going to pick up with it? Which aging player who's holding out for a bloated contract are we going to sign in the meantime?"
NYGiants,3dt2m8,Elided_Ego,1 point,Sun Jul 19 13:41:33 2015 UTC,"I can see that point. Still though, I am of the mind that it's time to look to the future. That cap space could either be spent securing Eli or signing a somewhat promising rookie. Thinking less cap space and more roster wise."
NYGiants,3dt2m8,BigBlueWookiee,2,Sun Jul 19 14:28:08 2015 UTC,Well. The benefit to the roster is that the other DEs get to play first team snaps now.
NYGiants,3dt2m8,Elided_Ego,-1,Sun Jul 19 15:16:37 2015 UTC,"This, exactly this."
NYGiants,3dt2m8,BigBlueWookiee,4,Sun Jul 19 21:56:03 2015 UTC,"I think we need to seriously reevaluate the franchise tag. Pull it.   But in the end, how does that benefit the roster?  At this point, the tag is there due to desperation.  If Spagnuolo continues to run the NASCAR packages he was successful with in 2007/08, we need a lot of fast defensive ends on passing downs. Getting rid of the tag and risking losing him doesn't do anything for us from a roster perspective.  It's not like this is February and there are other guys on the market... it's July, and there are no defensive ends left, which is not something you really screw around with.     Losing him puts us a bunch of money ahead in the 2016 season, but if Reese were the type of GM to only go all in when you're projected to win, 2008 and 2012 never would have happened.    You don't cut off your nose to spite your face.  Thankfully, Reese understands that."
NYGiants,3dt2m8,CarlosFromPhilly,1 point,Sun Jul 19 15:41:16 2015 UTC,"I agree, I would also like to see them pull the tag and let him test the market. The downside is that this happened so late in the off-season that there's no realistic better option to spend the money they had set aside for him. If there were still some free agents on the market it might have changed their response, but now I think they're sort of committed."
NYGiants,3dt2m8,napalmx,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:14:17 2015 UTC,I think we should be friends
NYGiants,3dt2m8,wooktrees,6,Sun Jul 19 21:47:19 2015 UTC,Holy strawman.
NYGiants,3dt2m8,CasanovaWong,4,Sun Jul 19 17:01:46 2015 UTC,"I'm not saying he's going to come back stronger any more than I'm saying Cruz is going to come back stronger.  I think what you're seeing in this sub and misinterpreting as homerism is a realization that we don't actually know what the impact of his injuries are going to be, and that we can't speak about it-- one way or the other-- until he starts suiting up.  Will it impact him so negatively that an increased work ethic and drive cannot overcome the injury?  No idea.  He's not a cornerback, he's not an offensive tackle.  He doesn't require grip the way some of the other positions do, and his index finger might not be as big a part of his ability as we're thinking.    The thumb is obviously the weak link here, and he will require recovery when he gets back, but to say that he is undoubtedly going to be worse off is just as silly as saying he's going to be better.    Until we can see him play, we have no real basis to form an opinion.    I will say this:  when the injury first happened, i watched every JPP highlight reel i could, and I honestly don't see him using his grip nearly as much as someone like an O Lineman does.  Correct me if i'm wrong, but the thumb seems to be the only question mark here because it's used so heavily when pushing off of a o tackle.  Otherwise, he could probably get away with a stump.  In fact, using a club cast a la Clay Matthews would actually do a great job keeping his thumb from being exposed while pounding off of linemen.    Again, if you can explain how grip is essential at his position or show tape, i'd love to see it because i am having trouble understanding this in the way that a lot of other people claim to."
NYGiants,3dt2m8,CarlosFromPhilly,6,Sun Jul 19 15:30:28 2015 UTC,"Yeah people don't realize his thumb is probably fucked up too.  I imagine him holding the firework when the accident happened, and you need more than one finger to hold something."
NYGiants,3dt2m8,SameShit2piles,2,Sun Jul 19 04:49:24 2015 UTC,"Exactly, and plus he can't lift with his hand that fucked up. He may come back and be able to play with a missing finger eventually but you can't just get a finger amputated then go back to lifting heavy. Then add the thumb on top of that and he won't be able to really train for a while. I wouldn't expect too much out of him the first few weeks he's back (whenever that may be) because he's not gonna be in shape and he's gotta get used to playing with a different hand."
NYGiants,3dt2m8,KingDusty,2,Sun Jul 19 15:10:27 2015 UTC,He has to relearn how to play basically
NYGiants,3dt2m8,noahruns,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:47:04 2015 UTC,The finger was always the least of my worries.  If the reports are true about the rest of the injuries he's got a lot of healing and most likely rehab to do before he can even think about getting ready for football.   I've had small fractures that took months to feel 100% again and not in a place as vital as my thumb.  (granted - i don't have the medical resources available to me that an NFL superstar does).   The guy did something really stupid and should be thankful that he didn't hurt anyone else AND that he still has a good chance to at least play at a competitive level in the NFL eventually.
NYGiants,3dt2m8,EGriffi5,2,Sun Jul 19 11:08:06 2015 UTC,Reports said his thumb had multiple fractures - no way his grip will be as strong.
NYGiants,3dt2m8,BigBlueWookiee,3,Sun Jul 19 06:19:47 2015 UTC,"How i see it, he wont come back better,  however he is our best DE.  The finger lost, index is probally the best to lose on his hand as its more used for dexterity over stength.  Make a fist, then make a second one without usng your index finger, the grip is still strong  What worries me the most is injury to his thumb and not being in OTAs or preseason to learn spags system"
NYGiants,3dt2m8,Big_lt,3,Sun Jul 19 12:25:29 2015 UTC,"JPP does have something to prove, that he's capable of playing.    Gmen will give JPP a year deal.  If he's incapable of making an impact, they won't resign him long term.  I think it's pretty simple."
NYGiants,3dt2m8,DudeFalcone,2,Sun Jul 19 19:25:15 2015 UTC,And in the mean time I feel it would be best to be positive about the situation. I have no idea why people are running around with their hair on fire. Even through the positivity I know JPP has a LOT to work through. I'd just rather stay on the bright side of things and hope for the best
NYGiants,3dt2m8,moldy_films,7,Sun Jul 19 19:37:38 2015 UTC,I spoke to an orthopedic doc friend about JPP.  He was not optimistic.   Neither am I.   He will never be the same.  He is such a great athlete it is possible he will have an NFL career.  No way is he a 15 million dollar franchise D end this year.  Probably not ever.
NYGiants,3dt2m8,philasurfer,6,Sun Jul 19 05:13:56 2015 UTC,"You could argue he really wasn't one before he lost the finger too. I mean, I love the guy, but you generally look for more consistency before you pay a guy franchise DE money."
NYGiants,3dt2m8,xenongamer4351,7,Sun Jul 19 05:20:09 2015 UTC,"1) it's our team. Unless your a shithead band wagoner your going to wish for the best and stay positive. We don't need no negative nancy undercover Peyton manning fans!   2) jpp is the best person on our rather unimpressive and cherry picked defense. Losing him hurts.   3) he's young, he's full of life, he's charitable and fun. No one wants to see this happen, especially as a result of wowing underprivileged kids   4) personally, jpp is my fav. I've always been partial to the d and the run game. That doesn't exist anymore and hasn't since our last Super Bowl win. I NEED JPP to be ok."
NYGiants,3dt2m8,Baitdoll,2,Sun Jul 19 08:16:41 2015 UTC,"I hear ya, but I am not optimistic. I think our best shot is that we end up looking like the 99 rams. Yes, I am saying that we need Cruz, ODB, and Randle to all have 1000 yard seasons and Vereen is going to have to be lights out. I love a defensive team, but I think this years offense will be one of the highest scoring that we've ever seen."
NYGiants,3dt2m8,JustAteAPizza,7,Mon Jul 20 13:23:42 2015 UTC,"All I can think about is how shitty he must feel about the whole thing. He busted his ass to get where he was, and was finally about to get an amazing contract. Now he's got a mangled hand and sliver of a chance of staying in the nfl. We all do stupid yet seemingly harmless things, but not many of us have as much to lose he did."

NYGiants,3dt2m8,choochooape,2,Sun Jul 19 15:45:10 2015 UTC,"If the price were consistent with ""taking a flyer,"" that'd be fine.  But you don't throw 10% of your salary cap space at a ""flyer."""
NYGiants,3dt2m8,3rdAnnual,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:24:43 2015 UTC,"Given his attitude prior to his injury, his lack of team spirit and a sluggish few years after his great rookie year, I'd say that the Giants need to find a way to get rid of JPP and focus on nurturing its current talent pool.   I'm not optimistic on a full recovery and elite play -- but prove me wrong JPP, I'd be happy to be wrong."

NYGiants,3dt2m8,VTFD,1 point,Sun Jul 19 15:25:42 2015 UTC,"By lack of team spirit I am referring to JPP not participating in voluntary camps set up this year. Instead of joining these camps such as other veterans, he decided to work out of Miami that eventually led to his recent incident."
NYGiants,3dt2m8,Wonginit,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:20:15 2015 UTC,Well first off him working out in Miami didn't lead to this incident.  He's from Florida and would have likely been there for the holiday anyway.  Second it is very common for a tagged player to skip out on team activities.  In this day and age players do not like being tagged and this is one of the ways they show it.
NYGiants,3dt2m8,FootballGiants,2,Mon Jul 20 16:26:52 2015 UTC,find a way to get rid of him.. yea just let him leave in FA. If he balls out or shows promise sure lets sign him but he's got one foot out the door already.
NYGiants,3dt2m8,toofastkindafurious,5,Mon Jul 20 14:01:14 2015 UTC,2011 (his best year) was his second year.
NYGiants,3dt2m8,SevenwithaT,3,Sun Jul 19 08:43:29 2015 UTC,"And it was also his only year with a supporting cast (Tuck and Osi). He's been pushing down with a decrepit Kiwi that the Giants kept on the line for reasons I can't fathom. Even with that he was still a monster against the run all season barring the game the entire defense shit the bed in Seattle. As soon as he had support with Hankins and Ayers when Kiwi went out he exploded with 5 sacks. Or maybe I should just revert to the ""JPEEPEE SUCKS HE CANT GET 15 SACKS A GAME"" mentality."

I highly doubt we're realistically going to the SB.   That means it's TC's last year. We're going through a coaching staff change next year. McAdoo will most likely take over, being in his own people, including DC (which means Spags gone again) so the defense will change again.  No sense getting locked into JPP (with all his various issues) if we'll be restructuring the D again."

NYGiants,3dp3qo,3rdAnnual,2,Sat Jul 18 02:35:55 2015 UTC,"Because cap resources are transferrable to 2016, 2015 was never likely to be a year when NYG makes a serious run, and Jason's performance is now hilariously unlikely to be worth $900K per game."
NYGiants,3dp3qo,3rdAnnual,2,Sat Jul 18 10:43:57 2015 UTC,His entire salary comes off the books in 2016 though... so how is it not transferred either way? It's a one-year contract
NYGiants,3dp3qo,CarlosFromPhilly,1 point,Sun Jul 19 00:33:25 2015 UTC,"By ""transferable,"" I mean that, if the Giants finish with $15M in unused cap space in 2015, their cap in 2016 is $15M higher than it would otherwise be."
NYGiants,3dp3qo,3rdAnnual,1 point,Sun Jul 19 00:42:00 2015 UTC,Right but that would also mean essentially forfeiting this season lol if JPP can play I'd rather have him play
NYGiants,3dp3qo,CarlosFromPhilly,4,Sun Jul 19 00:44:42 2015 UTC,"That is /u/3rdAnnual's point-- if the Giants are not in a playoff eligible year, just cut the losses and put money in the bank for 2016.    However: 1) If the Giants only played to win if a ring were ""likely,"" 2008 and 2012 never would have happened, and 2) Reese+Coughlin simply aren't wired that way    So it's moot.    Believe it or not, Reese and Coughlin how to win a super bowl.  If they are keeping JPP part of the roster, it's for a good reason.  If they thought his money would be better spent in 2016, they probably know enough about their five year plan to do it."
NYGiants,3dp3qo,HerpIES,1 point,Sun Jul 19 13:49:55 2015 UTC,"1) If the Giants only played to win if a ring were ""likely,"" 2008 and 2012 never would have happened, and   I'm not so certain.  I'm not saying that the team shouldn't ""play to win"" or should do nothing for 2015 alone.  Low-cost short-term investments are reasonable.  Kenrick Ellis, for example, is only on a 1-year deal, and I think that was one of the best moves the Giants made this offseason.  Keeping a guy on a franchise tag is another thing entirely-- it's a very high cost, short-term-only investment.   I might be forgetting something, but I don't recall any moves like that helping the teams win championships in the '07 & '11 seasons.  They had some low-cost short-term moves, like Sam Madison and Kawika Mitchell in '07, or maybe Chase Blackburn in '11, but not any superstars-level investments that weren't expected to last beyond that year.  (Maybe accommodating Strahan's holdout?  But he didn't really get any extra money, IIRC-- they just waived most of the fines from missing Camp.)  I'm fine with reasonable expenses to ensure that a starting spot is filled with an at-least-competent player.  It's dedicating 10% of the salary cap to a guy who almost certainly has no future with the club beyond 2015 that bugs me."
NYGiants,3dp3qo,ConcedeDota,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:19:59 2015 UTC,"I might be forgetting something, but I don't recall any moves like that helping the teams win championships in the '07 & '11 seasons     I hear you, and I agree completely on Kenrick Ellis (he's slimming down which makes me really excited to see him transition from NT to DT), but context is important here:    It's obvious, especially given the way the Giants have handled JPP that a lot of DE bodies will be a returning theme in Spagnuolo's offense.    You say you don't remember moves being done like this in 07, and from a business/contract perspective i think i agree, but the end result was being able to rush four defensive ends on a passing down.  As crazy as that seems to me, it worked over and over and over again.  However, something like that is impossible without a guy like JPP. I'm not saying that we have Four Aces potential going into this season, but without JPP the whole thing will likely have to be scrapped.      I know next to nothing about what the bones in JPP's hand looks like, nor am i a doctor, nor can i really go off of anything other than the wild speculation doctors who have never even met JPP are making for the opportunity to get paid spots on ESPN. What i do know, however, is that i don't think Reese is the type of guy to throw millions and millions of dollars at a guy who he sees as a high risk.  The giants are notoriously conservative, and rarely gamble with roster money.    I'm far more likely to believe that if JPP is not worth the money, hey would not be a part of the roster.  You don't have to go back too far to see this concept in action.  Remember how we handled Thurmond and Rolle at the start of free agency?"
NYGiants,3dp3qo,3rdAnnual,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:34:21 2015 UTC,"I'm really tired of these claims. What makes you so sure that he is ""a guy who almost certainly has no future with the club beyond 2015?"" You don't think that maybe, just maybe, this injury could be a wake up call to JPP? You don't think that because of this incident he is embarrassed and wants to prove himself? You don't think that if he comes back and crushes it that it's not worth the 1 year investment? You don't think that if he crushes it, he'll be signed to a long term deal? You don't think that if he crushes it, you'll be happy that he was franchise tagged this year? Stop being so pessimistic and have faith in the front office that has won us two Super Bowls in the past 8 years. You don't get paid to make these decisions, they do."

The only information we have is that one pic from Schefter, and the info that Jason's agent has chosen to leak.    If an explosion was bad enough that his index finger had to be amputated, what are the chances that his other fingers don't also have some structural damage? What are the chances that the thumb is a simple break, and doesn't involve complicated nerve, muscle, joint, and tendon issues?

In both cases, when the injury happened in an explosion, chances are very good that other body parts within a couple inches of the finger in question also sustained heavy damage."

JPP is exceptional against the run and pass. He handles the very very good LTs in they NFC east. If we had a real LB corp and he could just get after the passer more you would see some serious sack numbers.
NYGiants,3dp3qo,3rdAnnual,-1,Sat Jul 18 14:55:28 2015 UTC,2011 JPP would be worth $900K/game.  2014 JPP would be worth a little less than that.  2015 JPP isn't even going to be close.
NYGiants,3dp3qo,Rutawitz,2,Sat Jul 18 17:19:07 2015 UTC,Ok well 900k a game is 14.4 mm/year. I wouldn't disagree that's more than we want to pay. But these posts act like $6mm/year would be fair value. We have no pressure without JPP last year.  Hopefully this year Ellis and Hankins help fix that.

A huge part of his stellar performance against the run was being elite at grabbing his blocker and moving them into the running lane, not evading them. That aspect of his game is almost certainly gone. His value now lies primarily with his ability to speed/bull rush, which probably won't suffer, but hasn't been very impressive in years."

NYGiants,3dp3qo,DXGypsy,1 point,Sat Jul 18 19:52:43 2015 UTC,"He has to prove he can do it with one less finger. That is so backwards to think otherwise.

But the amount of people questioning those who are skeptical about his performance is ridiculous. I know this sub is very homerish, but these past few weeks have been the worst. It is seriously worse than /r/nfl in here now."
NYGiants,3dp3qo,uzi716,1 point,Sun Jul 19 04:21:43 2015 UTC,well the index finger contributes the least amount of strength to the hand;s overall grip.  i like this sub too but like r/nfl it likes to go with a story and take it waaaaayyy out of proportion

NYGiants,3dp3qo,k3ithk,2,Sat Jul 18 16:44:20 2015 UTC,"Even so, when taking together everything he's up against -- amputation, fractured thumb, skin grafts, missing invaluable time practicing and learning a new defensive scheme, the media shit storm that will whirling around all season, the distraction of ravenous fans going into an uproar when he evenutually steps onto the field, and then, the inevitable booing when his play isn't up to snuff, not to mention the purely psychological aspect of learning to function (let alone compete against other NFL players) without a finger and, lastly, but certainly not least, the stark realization that he'll be playing for his financial future in a lot of ways -- it's just hard to imagine he can overcome it all. Especially (and cover your eyes if you can't handle a dose of upcoming reality, kids) after a string of seasons which may have revealed that JPP may not be as dominant as once thought.  I don't see him being an impact player this season. I don't think he gets onto the field until October. By that point it may be too late to rally for all the reasons stated above."
NYGiants,3dp3qo,Wonginit,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:37:51 2015 UTC,"His biggest obstacle will be pain... anything else after that will be irrelevant... Trust me, when I say that the thumb/missing index, will cause massive amounts of pain and strain on his hand and that will limit is play, but other than that, he will and should be in playing shape come game 1, doubt he is used too often but will be part of a System which is what Spags was brought in to do. I am confident JPP will play 100% effort wise as we hill be under the microscope. Come October he should be used more frequently. He has the organization, teammates and veterans of the league behind him... I don't doubt in his ability and I sure as hell don't doubt in his effort."

He HAS to do the best he can with what he has not, in a sense he is backed into a corner with the Giants, and if they let him go, he will play somewhere else and have a chip on his shoulder on top of it all which only makes for more fuel.. Keep him, help him rehab and watch him flourish for the next 4-5 years in blue hopefully."

NYGiants,3dp3qo,JewJitzutTed,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:56:48 2015 UTC,"The thing is, I don't think the team sees this as a freak accident.  Jason is not a smart man, and they know it.  This can't be the first example of his dumbfuckery they've witnessed.  They lowballed him in negotiations over a long-term deal in large part because they think he's an idiot with questionable drive to succeed-- they were only interested in keeping Jason around long-term if he signed at a serious discount.  They were content with the Tag because they still thought he had the talent to be a gamebreaking playmaker, but I don't think they ever envisioned him taking on any kind of leadership role.  And all that was before he shook hands with an m80.    IMO, motivation can only get you so far.  He's physically damaged, he'll be doing zero training between now and the regular season, and he'll be months behind in learning the defense (which is not a strong point of his to begin with).  It'll be an interesting season, but probably not in a good way."

Come September he will be able to practice fully (pain withholding). And in terms of learning the defense, this is Spags we're talking about here, he should be very familiar with what they want him to do as a pass rusher and run blocker... he will have if anything a lot of time next month to stay in the film room w/ the line and understand things better. I'm the optimist here because I don't think things are as bad as many people who always want to expect the worst feel they are. A lot of his issues just revolve around half of his hand are strength/grip/and pain related you know? I can't see that limiting him too much unless his mind isn't in the game and just wants to leave to begin with."

He can still DO EVERYTHING ELSE, he isn't dead. The point is, will underperforming be significant to the scheme of the Defensive line? How long will he underperform due to his weaker right hand and learns to use new techniques etc... that come with injuries.

NYGiants,3dns5w,Danimal252525,2,Fri Jul 17 20:39:20 2015 UTC,I was listening to the game with headphones at work.   I fell to the ground on the verge of tears listening to the punt return.   People thought i was having a heart attack.
NYGiants,3dns5w,out_of_time,8,Fri Jul 17 23:41:36 2015 UTC,"Nov. 16, 2008. Somewhere in this game Plax tweaked an already bothersome hamstring. That kept him out of the following game but he was 50/50 for the game the following week, vs. Washington. He then shot himself.   Had he never tweaked his hamstring, we go on to win out - finishing 15-1 and rolling through the playoffs. And repeat as champs.  2009 - Sure we miss out on a few good years of Nicks because we wouldn't draft him the following year, instead we get Patrick Chung. Thus avoiding the Aaron Rouse year. But we finish 11-5 and make the playoffs. We of course threepeat (because this is fantasy time.)   2010 - We still draft JPP - much later because teams are afraid to draft such an unknown product. We do miss out on Phillip Dillard but O'Brien Schofield is there waiting. He doesn't become a super star but thrives under Spags as a pass rusher. Fortunately we pick up Ben Tate too. Marcus McNeil comes to us in FA market, not a perfect player but decent. Instead of 10-6, we finish 11-5 even though Plex is starting to lose a step. We do make the playoffs though...so we go all the way and win, obviously.   2011 - This is tough. We know Plex is getting older and we know it. With that in mind we trade him to move up to the 20th pick and still get Prince (see flair...I'm not going to get rid of him!) In the 2nd round though we get Randall Cobb (who went at that pick.) At the end of the 3rd we take Jordan Cameron. We also snag Jason Kelce.  We now have Cobb, Cameron, Cruz, Manningham, Bradshaw, Jacobs, and Ballard to help out Eli. We snag Marshall Yanda in the FA market. 14-2 with a Super Bowl victory. (In reality we lost most games by less than 10 points that season, we were very close to being a playoff team.)  2012 -  We don't take David Wilson because Ben Tate is starting to come into his own. Coincidentally, Wilson goes a few picks later to the Colts where he and Luck become an unstoppable force in the AFC, the hit that ended his career never happened and we all wish we picked him even though we had Tate/Bradshaw. We pick up Carl Nicks in FA market because the line needs help...but not much; we have Beatty - Yanda - Kelce - Nicks - McNeil with Diehl as a swing player. In this plan Snee is able to retire a bit early. Although he could still start this year and then retire at the conclusion...regardless...Super Bowl.  2013 - (I should note that at this point, I just took an hour off to make a wall sconce. I cut apart the plug to a vacuum cleaner and some hardwood plywood. More importantly though, I drank 4 IPA's.) We drafted Pugh but in my world we don't need him so we take Gio Bernard. Also, yadda yadda yadda we still end up with Hankins. But Eli gets dinged up and has to sit after game 3 because Diehl never got the notice that he should retire to the booth and he had to play for Yanda. First play, he fucking screws everything up and Eli gets blowed the fuck up. Nassib (who plays okay, but not great) we go 6-10. Because....  2014 -  We still draft OBJ!!!! Also sign Zach Strief. Blah, blah, blah...Super Bowl.  2015 - Redraft: Landon Collins, AJ Cann, Owa,,,and whoever else we got because drunk.  Roster for this year:    WR: OBJ, Cruz, Cobb, Randle, Washington, Talley TE: Cameron, Donnell, Robinson QB: Eli, Nassib RB: Bernard, Williams, Vereen...because I want it to be so. Starting OL: Beatty - Yanda - Richburg - Schwartz (because I said so) - Strief.   Ugh...I'm sick of this game. But you can see that if we didn't let Plax hurt himself it would make us the greatest dynasty of all time. Get it?  Now...accepting downvotes."

NYGiants,3djf9b,loldi,2,Thu Jul 16 19:26:11 2015 UTC,"1995 & 1996: EVERYONE WAS ON VACATION, NOTHING BAD HAPPENED:      The Giant's pretty much took a hiatus during these two years, finishing 5-11 and 6-10 in 1995 and 1996, respectively.    Notable Things:     The Snowball Game - in the final game of the 1995 season against the San Diego Chargers, fans bombarded the field/players with snowballs leading to 175 fan ejections and 15 arrests.   1996 Draft - In the 2nd round of the '96 draft, the New York Giants selected Amani Toomer, WR, Michigan with the 34th Overall pick.  Toomer would go on to hold the Giants' records for most career receiving yards, receptions, receiving touchdowns, and most consecutive games with a catch.       1997: The Jim Fassel Era Begins:  Owner(s):  Wellington + Robert Tish  Head Coach:  Jim Fassel  General Manager:  George Young    Record Place Leading Passer Leading Rusher Leading Receiver    10-5-1 1st NFC East Danny Kanell (1740 Yards) Charles Way (698 Yards) Chris Calloway (849 Yards)   Total Rushing Yards Total Passing Yards Total Yards Points Per Game Turnovers   1988 (7th) 2525 (28th) 4513 (27th) 19.2 (21st) 19 (1st)   Total Rushing Yards Allowed Total Passing Yards Allowed Total Yards Allowed Points Per Game Allowed Takeaways   1451 (3rd) 3616 (26th) 5067 (18th) 16.6 (6th) 44 (1st)    The 1997 season brought about changes that would begin to lead the Giants’ on a path back to the Super Bowl.  On January 15th, 1997, Jim Fassel was named the 15th head coach in Giant’s history.  Thanks to a staunch run defense and forcing a leauge-leading 44 turnovers, the team finished 1st in the NFCE with a 10-5-1 record.  For the first time in 4 years the Giants’ qualified for the playoffs, where they lost in the wild card round to the Vikings (23-22).  For his efforts, Fassel was named the 1997 Coach of the Year.    The running back trio for the ‘97 Giants consisted of Tyrone Wheatley, Charles Way, and rookie Tiki Barber.  These three rushed for 583, 698, and 511 yards, respectively.  Additionally, all three players averaged over 41 yards/game and had at least 3 touchdowns.  Total yards from scrimmage for the trio was 723 (Wheatley), 1002 (Way), and 810 (Barber).  These numbers would put them in the top 4 for total yards for the team with WR Chris Calloway coming in 2nd with 848 yards/scrimmage.  First Round Draft Pick:  Ike Hilliard - WR - Florida - 7th Overall  Other Notable Draft Picks:  Tiki Barber - RB - Virginia - 36th Overall      1998: At Least We Beat the Broncos:  Owner(s):  Wellington + Robert Tish  Head Coach:  Jim Fassel  General Manager:  Ernie Accorsi    Record Place Leading Passer Leading Rusher Leading Receiver    8-8 3rd NFC East Danny Kanell (1603 Yards) Gary Brown (1063 Yards) Chris Calloway (812 Yards)   Total Rushing Yards Total Passing Yards Total Yards Points Per Game Turnovers   1889 (12th) 2566 (28th) 4455 (29th) 17.9 (23rd) 24 (8th)   Total Rushing Yards Allowed Total Passing Yards Allowed Total Yards Allowed Points Per Game Allowed Takeaways   2004 (23rd) 3167 (23th) 5171 (19th) 19.3 (8th) 26 (19th)    The 1998 season was a letdown after their previous seasons revival.  Finishing 8-8 and missing the playoffs, the Giants’ only point of pride during the season was a week 15 victory over the previously undefeated, and eventual Super Bowl champion, Denver Broncos.    Amani Toomer makes an incredible catch late in the 4th quarter to seal the victory for the Giants.  First Round Draft Pick:  Shaun Williams - DB - UCLA - 24th Overall  Other Notable Draft Picks:  Joe Jurevicius - WR - Penn State - 55th Overall      1999: A Disappointing Decade Comes to An End:  Owner(s):  Wellington + Robert Tish  Head Coach:  Jim Fassel  General Manager:  Ernie Accorsi    Record Place Leading Passer Leading Rusher Leading Receiver    7-9 3rd NFC East Kerry Collins (2318 Yards) Joe Montgomery (348 Yards) Amani Toomer (1183 Yards)   Total Rushing Yards Total Passing Yards Total Yards Points Per Game Turnovers   1408 (24th) 3719 (8th) 5127 (17th) 18.7 (20th) 32 (16th)   Total Rushing Yards Allowed Total Passing Yards Allowed Total Yards Allowed Points Per Game Allowed Takeaways   1560 (13th) 3421 (14th) 4981 (13th) 22.4 (23rd) 24 (26th)    1999 closed out a disappointing decade for the New York Giants.  Memories of the 1990 Super Bowl victory were long gone by this point, and instead Giants' fans were left scratching their heads.    Filled with coaching and quarterback changes, the team made the playoffs only once and lost it’s only game.  However, promising draft picks during this decade would build a foundation that would see the Giants’ make several Super Bowl runs over the next 10 years.  First Round Draft Pick:  Luke Petitgout - T - Notre Dame - 19th Overall  Other Notable Draft Picks:  Dan Campbell - TE - Texas A&M - 79th Overalll"

Before the season the Giants had a lot of uncerainty because LT and Phil Simms Giants stalwarts for over a decade were gone. And out QB was Dave Brown.  That season the Giants would start 3-0 , lose 7 in a row, and then win the last 6 games of their season. The Giants highlight win was that season was when Dave Brown lead the Giants to a last second comeback vs Bill Belichick's playoff bound Browns in the dog pound."

NYGiants,3dgg80,Elided_Ego,2,Thu Jul 16 04:56:44 2015 UTC,He could walk but it probably would be a bad career decision. At this point he either signs and plays off the franchise tag with the Giants and makes a good salary this season and proves he's worth a big contract or he rolls the dice and sees what other teams will offer him now that he's a totally unknown commodity with his injury.  I think he would be lucky to get anything more than a one year prove it deal from another team and that would be significantly less than he's get from the tag deal. Excuse the pun but he lost all leverage by blowing his hand up. Now both him and the Giants are basically stuck with each other and they both desperately have to hope he can still play at a high level or they are both in big trouble.

NYGiants,3dgg80,Mayo841,2,Thu Jul 16 20:52:50 2015 UTC,"As someone who has no idea who Mo'ne Davis is, can anyone explain to me why she won Breakthrough Athlete over Beckham? I guess not quite why she won it, but rather why did she have so many votes?  Thanks."
NYGiants,3dgg80,pierovera,5,Thu Jul 16 03:49:52 2015 UTC,"Because she's a girl playing in a boys sport.  It's ridiculous.  If a boy hits a ton of bombs in the LLWS and is an ace pitcher they don't even get recognized.  She doesn't even want to play the sport in college, she wants to play basketball.  No chance should she have won it over the best golfer since Tiger, let alone the best WR since Randy."

NYGiants,3dgg80,darkeagle91,5,Thu Jul 16 04:03:18 2015 UTC,"I give her credit for playing well, I just don't think ""Breakthrough athlete"" is the appropriate category for her to win.  I don't think U14 little league is as hard to break through into as a professional sport, and I think the title infers you have ""broken through"" into a level of sustained and long-term future success, whereas she has no plans to continue playing baseball long term.

NYGiants,3disoe,Frosssty,14,Thu Jul 16 16:42:59 2015 UTC,"I know that JPP bashing is in vogue right now, but without him for an extended period of time, there's certainly a problem."
NYGiants,3disoe,Flavor_Flavius,4,Thu Jul 16 18:32:56 2015 UTC,The real issue is the Giants have no idea what the depth behind JPP can do in real games.   DaMonster could be a valuable rush DE in the tune of what Osi was. But he hasn't had a lot of snaps because he was a run liability and had assignment issues in Fewells scheme.  Ayers is a guy who has looked good in limited duty but coming off a major injury. Can he return to form and can he handle a full time role?  Selvie is more of a run stopper than a real pass rusher.   O-Diggy is a 3rd round rookie.  Wynn looked pretty good in limited duty last year but he is a young guy that we don't know much about.   There are plenty of options to put on the field but as much as JPP can be frustrating you also know what he can be. We don't know very much about anyone beyond him. You feel a lot better thinking only 1 of those guys has to stick as a difference maker instead of two of them in starting roles.
NYGiants,3disoe,xinik,5,Thu Jul 16 18:52:00 2015 UTC,Moore has looked totally undisciplined
NYGiants,3disoe,KingDusty,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:13:28 2015 UTC,Thus the reason he doesn't see the field. He can clearly get after the QB but can he learn to do it in a controlled way so as not to be a liability in other ways? He is still so young too... if I am not mistaken he is younger then Odighizuwa!
NYGiants,3disoe,xinik,1 point,Fri Jul 17 02:05:45 2015 UTC,"Its scary. But I rather suck, save the cap space, and get these young guys snaps, then freak out chasing after a JPP who may never be the same again..."
NYGiants,3disoe,Elided_Ego,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:59:58 2015 UTC,So the thing is he won't play unless he is physically capable and the Giants will have something like $60 million in cap space next offseason. They don't necessarily need the money and you are not going to use it to replace JPP. There are no guys available that would be difference makers at this point. Maybe you sign Evan Mathis as a 1 year rental? Does that really make this team a contender?    But either way the Giants used the Franchise tag to determine if they were ever going to throw long term money at JPP. I don't think that has changed. They obviously have more to consider now but the Giants are a class organization. They won't cut bait and abandon the guy now. It's not how they do business.
NYGiants,3disoe,xinik,6,Fri Jul 17 02:09:39 2015 UTC,He's a rookie though. JPP had 12.5 sacks last year. I'd be surprised if Owamagbe got half of that
NYGiants,3disoe,domspart,6,Thu Jul 16 16:52:23 2015 UTC,"With 9 of them coming in the final 5 weeks, against really shitty teams (Jags, Titans, Redskins, Rams and Eagles). He probably realized that having 3.5 sacks in the first 11 games he was about to get fucked royally in terms of contracts and turned it on a bit.  I love me some JPP, but it's starting to get more clear that this dude just doesn't get it. Not consistent enough, doesn't bring it every single game like some of the greats do (see JJ Watt). Losing JPP could be a blessing in disguise, let the hungry rookies get these reps."
NYGiants,3disoe,xinik,9,Thu Jul 16 16:55:03 2015 UTC,Those may be bad teams but the Skins and the Eagles have top LT's in the league. JPP fights it out with those guys and manages to win some of those fights. JJ Watt also feasts on lower competition -- the bulk of his numbers come against sub par teams just like everyone else.  JPP is a frustrating guy but it's hard to imagine a 3rd round pick coming in and doing what he is capable of.   Plus O-Diggy seems to do his best work with inside moves. In the pro's edge rushers are expected to contain and don't use inside moves very much because it blows contain. His hip issue deprives him of bend around the edge which hopefully continues to get better as he separates himself further from those surgeries. I think the best case scenario for him this year is to get mixed into the rotation and an effective rusher from the inside in obvious passing plays. You would have to be happy if the guy gives you 5 or 6 sacks as a rookie.   The Giants simply don't have anyone that offers what a healthy and interested JPP gives. But will he be either one of those things in 2015?
NYGiants,3disoe,saudade44,3,Thu Jul 16 17:09:58 2015 UTC,"Skins also lost Trent Williams to injury in that game, so JPP was roughing up a backup LT for the majority of the game (if I remember correctly)"
NYGiants,3disoe,rexanimate7,2,Thu Jul 16 19:46:14 2015 UTC,"Those may be bad teams but the Skins and the Eagles have top LT's in the league.   Keep in mind, both the Eagles and the Skins also had absolutely decimated interior lines.  If all your starting guards are hurt, it doesn't matter how good your tackles are because the line won't be gelling, and the middle will be weak.  See our line in 2013 if you need an example of what that ends up like.  Also, if you look at us playing the Eagles last year, there were several plays where JPP got handled by Brent Celek.  That's not something that should happen when a guy is supposed to be an elite pass rushing DE.  edit - Regarding JJ Watt... lets just remember how much feasting he gets to do.  He plays in the same division that Peyton Manning played in, and 90% of the time the Colts are the only team winning anything in that division.  He is a great defensive player, but it's not quite the same as the NFC East or even the NFC North.  AFC South is a lot like the AFC East where you can just bet most of the times the Patriots will run away with it."
NYGiants,3disoe,xinik,2,Thu Jul 16 21:03:02 2015 UTC,Good point about the Skins and Eagles and yeah JPP also can disappear. Part of why he is so damn frustrating as a player is everyone expects him to be a dominating player but he just never elevated to that level.   As for Watt -- don't get me wrong he is a one man wrecking crew. But he had 20.5 sacks last year 10 of them came in just 4 games. The two times he played the Jags and the Titans... Throw in the 4 he had against the colts and the man had 14 sacks in his 6 division games and 6.5 sacks in the 12 games outside the division...
NYGiants,3disoe,rexanimate7,1 point,Fri Jul 17 02:18:56 2015 UTC,"Yep, and when you see how we played the Texans last year, our O line handled Watt rather well."
NYGiants,3disoe,LeDudicus,2,Fri Jul 17 02:23:57 2015 UTC,Mostly because Jadaveon Clowney went down early in the season and the Giants could afford to just triple team JJ.
NYGiants,3disoe,rexanimate7,1 point,Sun Jul 19 06:47:32 2015 UTC,"I won't deny that at all, and was actually talking with my brother about DEs over beers this afternoon.  Watt is definitely impressive, and he also doesn't have much help.  When one other guy on your defense goes down, and it affords teams the ability to focus on one end and be ok, it just shows how absolutely important Watt is to the Texans."
NYGiants,3disoe,xinik,0,Sun Jul 19 22:15:40 2015 UTC,"Tuck was a third round pick, Osi was a second round pick, Strahan was a second round pick, etc. Doesn't matter where youre drafted, it's about talent, motor, and willingness to get better. Seems like Diggy has all the intangibles."
NYGiants,3disoe,The_Other_Manning,3,Thu Jul 16 17:17:46 2015 UTC,I know but you also need to be realistic about what to expect out of a third round rookie -- which would be a contributor who manages a handful of pressures.   If he has a ceiling as high as Tuck we will be very happy with the selection but our last 3rd round DE -- DaMonster -- has barely seen the field thus far. And this is fairly normal for Giants DE's though if he has the talent and the drive this should be the year it materializes.  At the moment OO is buried on the depth chart and has to play his way onto the field before we can expect to count on him for anything. There will be opportunities but its a tad hasty to make it sound like it's a sure thing.   Strahan struggled early in his Career and it took him about 4 years to put it all together. Osi had a single start and no sacks in his rookie season. Tuck only had a single sack his rookie year. The JPP issue is about 2015 not two or three years from now.
NYGiants,3disoe,The_Other_Manning,5,Thu Jul 16 17:28:32 2015 UTC,"It's not a blessing in disguise. He is our best player in the d line. There's being optimistic and looking at the silver lining, then there's being delusional"
NYGiants,3disoe,moldy_films,-4,Thu Jul 16 17:40:24 2015 UTC,The blessing if we get to keep Prince and not pay JPP 100 million bucks to mail it in in year two of his deal.
NYGiants,3disoe,moldy_films,3,Thu Jul 16 17:56:40 2015 UTC,"I disagree with your thought that he was mailing it in. I don't get that thought. 2011 was amazing, 2012-13 he was injured, last year he still did really well and started doing even better when he wasn't the only good DE on the line. JPP is a great player"
NYGiants,3disoe,rsmjr,3,Thu Jul 16 18:11:35 2015 UTC,9 of them also coming when a decrepit Kiwanuka was taken off the line and replaced by Ayers who gave JPP some actual pressure to support with. Also they might not have been the beat teams but a lot of those lines had pro bowl players on them.. How do people over look this? JPP had NO support and as soon as he did he exploded.
NYGiants,3disoe,domspart,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:21:21 2015 UTC,"fair point. never understand why they kept running Kiwi out there when he was clearly worthless. Ayers is gonna be a great signing, dude is underrated as fuck"
NYGiants,3disoe,TheCowgirlCrusher,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:28:16 2015 UTC,They kept him out there because he was a valuable player before we destroyed his body switching him to sides and positions that weren't native to his skill set. I think it was partly because he had sparks of greatness and partly because they had no other options and owed it to him in a way..

NYGiants,3disoe,rexanimate7,2,Fri Jul 17 02:26:06 2015 UTC,"You can't just look at sacks to evaluate a defensive lineman.  Give me a break.    JPP has had injury problems and has been hindered by lack of consistency on the entire defense.  He's also a tremendous DE against the run.  Remember when we had Osi and he was a straight up turn-style against running backs?  Run defense matters too.    That fact is, this just sucks and we're going to have to play it by ear with JPP and our entire D-Line.  Let's hope for the best."

NYGiants,3ddud6,EliTheGod,18,Wed Jul 15 14:25:45 2015 UTC,An underrated safety with great coverage skills who was able to shine under Spags tutelage in Baltimore. Giants made a smart move to add talent and a veteran presence to one of their weakest/inexperienced position groups. Hopefully he comes in and amps up competition for the a starting job.
NYGiants,3ddud6,kinghayden,8,Wed Jul 15 14:46:04 2015 UTC,I would not say great coverage skills
NYGiants,3ddud6,ed2rummy,10,Wed Jul 15 14:58:47 2015 UTC,"Well, usually when news about a new signing happens people get a little overhyped no matter who it is... so we'll see what happens when training camp actually starts"
NYGiants,3ddud6,te3referee,5,Wed Jul 15 15:27:03 2015 UTC,if it means anything i like him more than the  FS Rookie Terrence Brooks and SS Matt Elam from the Ravens but all three were miss tackle extraordinair
NYGiants,3ddud6,ed2rummy,8,Wed Jul 15 15:30:20 2015 UTC,"Not a bad thing at all, even if it does end up just being camp competition.  Just a subtle reminder for everyone, who were the safeties on the Giants roster when Spags last coached the D in 2007? 2008?   2007 - Gibril Wilson (only notable one in the bunch, left in free agency after the season), Michael Johnson, James Butler, and Craig Dahl 2008 - Kenny Phillips (rookie year), Michael Johnson, James Butler, and Sammy Knight   How many household names did we have at the safety position?  Phillips would have been one of the NFL elite had he not suffered from the degenerative knee condition he had, and Gibril Wilson was a serviceable NFL safety that left in free agency for big money to only fizzle with most of his best playing having been done in blue.  We never had a big name at the back end of the defense under Spags, and Collins and Phillips are the two best players that he has coached for the Giants at the position.    This isn't Fewell's system of ""coverage sacks,"" and the onus is really on the linebackers making the right calls while the D Line gets to the QB as fast as possible.  Extra competition in camp will only ensure we end up with the best 4 at the position on the final roster."
NYGiants,3ddud6,rexanimate7,1 point,Wed Jul 15 15:52:40 2015 UTC,If I recall correctly he liked more physical than cover safeties in his scheme as they were often involved in blitz and such. This might explain the recent moves we've been making in regards to the safety position.
NYGiants,3ddud6,DezBryantsMom,4,Thu Jul 16 00:30:03 2015 UTC,"I have to imagine it'll be a veteran-minimum-type deal.  The guy hung around in free agency for a really long time; signing now screams ""settling for the least-bad option to get on a roster before camp.""    More competition at a weak spot on the roster is a good thing, but I'll hold out hope that the young guys can outperform a guy with 3 starts in 6 seasons."
NYGiants,3ddud6,3rdAnnual,3,Wed Jul 15 14:54:19 2015 UTC,"Pretty sure he is decent on special teams, too.  Definitely a depth-add and probably expected to help the rookies learn Spag's system."
NYGiants,3ddud6,chron67,3,Wed Jul 15 19:11:51 2015 UTC,"Well, Spagnuolo was a DBs coach in BAL, not the DC.  Miles was playing in Dean Pees' system.  Spagnuolo's might be similar, but it's not necessarily so.    That said, it does say something that the DC has personal experience working with the guy, and (presumably) wants to keep doing so."
NYGiants,3ddud6,3rdAnnual,4,Wed Jul 15 19:15:47 2015 UTC,I read Ravens Safety and immediately thought of Will Hill.    :(

NYGiants,3ddud6,CarlosFromPhilly,3,Wed Jul 15 21:28:13 2015 UTC,"I really like the move. Worst case scenario he is veteran depth at a position that is very low on game experience. In a best case scenario he becomes sort of a player coach. Since spent the last two years under Coach Spags, he knows what he wants from safeties and how to take that and translate it to players. A quality get. Also he is a Jersey boy so it must feel great for him to come home."

NYGiants,3ddud6,ablebodiedmango,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:57:35 2015 UTC,"I really did not get the impression that anyone thinks of this as the next coming of Jesus.  What it is, is adding a serviceable veteran in what is almost certainly the team's weakest area.  We were looking a potential lineup of four safeties who had combined started a total of zero NFL games; while Miles raises this number all the way up to 3!, he at least has some experience in the league.  So given that the investment is probably minimal, and the potential for some sort of return is there, not seeing why we should be pissing and moaning about it."
NYGiants,3ddud6,shadowaic,1 point,Thu Jul 16 01:27:25 2015 UTC,The comments indicate he's a great signing yada yada... as with pretty much every single other free agent signing.  It's setting yourself up for disappointment if the guy gets cut before the season starts.
NYGiants,3ddud6,ablebodiedmango,0,Thu Jul 16 01:30:23 2015 UTC,"Some of us are happy to be adding depth at our shallowest position.... But fuck us, right?"
NYGiants,3ddud6,VTFD,0,Thu Jul 16 03:34:33 2015 UTC,Yayyyy camp fodder.  Yayyy not really a solution or answer to the safety problem. Yayyyy
NYGiants,3ddud6,ablebodiedmango,0,Thu Jul 16 03:36:32 2015 UTC,You wouldn't be happy unless we did somehow pry Earl Thomas away from Seattle.  Enjoy your insufferable pessimism. That'd make 1 of us.
NYGiants,3ddud6,VTFD,1 point,Thu Jul 16 03:39:49 2015 UTC,"roflmao yeah this offseason has been FULL of optimism.  From losing the starting left tackle to the best defensive player on the team losing a finger, this has been a fucking amazing offseason.  Anybody who is not optimistic should be shot on sight, right?  I'm a realist, something folks like you detest because it intrudes on fantasy.    And FYI, just because I don't get giddy over a shitty roster filling move doesn't mean I wouldn't be enthused by legitimate free agency signings, which has been sorely lacking.  Aside from Vereen and overpaying a special teamer and a couple of linebackers, this has been a pretty awful offseason for signings.  The safety position is STILL completely unaddressed for proven talent.  Your hyperbole aside, the REALITY is that it has been quite a miserable affair."
NYGiants,3ddud6,ablebodiedmango,1 point,Thu Jul 16 04:29:57 2015 UTC,"What if I told you that optimism vs pessimism is attitudinal and not based on facts? The only thing you can really control in this world is your reaction to stimuli.  Your posts demonstrate a shitty attitude characterized by consistent negativity.  Nothing is ever as bad as it seems; nothing is ever as good as it seems.  It's possible to acknowledge both strengths and weaknesses, good news and bad, without being totally sarcastic with negativity or blinded by idealism."
NYGiants,3ddud6,VTFD,1 point,Thu Jul 16 04:36:43 2015 UTC,"Yet again, you avoid the idea of ""realism.""  I am realistic that for the past 4 years this team has been consistently... well bad.  The Giants have been a bad team.  The front office consistently makes head scratchers for moves in free agency, consistently fails to address core positions, and often draft players with injury histories so by the time their development is finished they aren't even good enough to stay on the team for depth.  Not to mention 3 years of miserable drafts which have lead to the past 2 seasons of scrambling for replacements and depth.    I wasn't really disappointed by last season because it was obvious it wasn't going to be a very good one.  Just becasue I didn't jump on the McAdoo bandwagon doesn't mean I was 'pessimistic'.  I saw a reality where the offensive line was horrendous and the defense was clearly giving up and stopped caring.  That's not Giants football.  Whatever is going on with this team it's troubling, and I'm not going to just ignore that because some people don't like to read opinions contrary to the consensus.  And to get to a finer point - I am not going to laud the signing of a guy who has started 3 games over the past three seasons, especially since there's been months where a LEGITIMATE depth signing could have been made and this is the best they could do.  I'm not happy with the team. Sue me."
NYGiants,3ddud6,ablebodiedmango,1 point,Thu Jul 16 04:43:28 2015 UTC,Is there a better FA S you'd like to see the Giants sign on July 15th?
NYGiants,3ddud6,VTFD,1 point,Thu Jul 16 04:46:40 2015 UTC,July 15th? Probably not.  But the offseason didn't start today.
NYGiants,3ddud6,ablebodiedmango,1 point,Thu Jul 16 04:47:09 2015 UTC,"Then build a time machine or chill out.  There's nothing to be gained by complaining now about what happened in April, May, or June.  I hope you can accept where this team is and look forward to better times like I have, because it's a lot more fun.  It's a lot more fun to look to the future and hope for better times than it is to dwell in the past and wallow in what 'could have been'  If your team is in the news this time of year, it's generally bad. Let's decide that adding a backup S is good news, learn about newest Giant, and give him a chance to surprise us.  I'm going to bed - tomorrow is going to be a great day. I hope you decide the same."
NYGiants,3de1rm,Highway395,14,Wed Jul 15 15:22:03 2015 UTC,"The injury he suffered last year was really kept quiet but he had a better pre-season than Jerry, Richburg, and Baas. He was drafted as a project who only really played 2 years of OT in college. In JC he played DE and TE. He's very athletic.   Side by side he's 15-20 pounds heavier than Pugh, 2 inches taller, 2 inches extra arm length and stronger. It seems like, coming out of college, he was a bit slow (with good, athletic feet) because he packed on a lot of weight to transition positions. It was always going to take him some time to learn to use his ""new"" body.   Who knows. But I've always thought he would be the guy. Over Herman, Brewer, McCants, etc. I also have high hopes for Hart as well, but you know, in 3-4 years."

Seriously people.   http://www.fantasypros.com/2015/07/2015-fantasy-football-10-things-you-dont-want-to-repeat-from-last-years-draft/   Recycling a Popular Team Name – C’mon guys. We’ve all heard the “punny” players team names and the crude, sexual innuendos that you have to live with for the year. Get creative this year. Stop googling “Best Fantasy Football” names and reach back and find a team name that will set your team apart. This obviously won’t give your team points on the board. But when you’re drafting and you see your team in the on-deck circle, you can get excited about unleashing your next pick. Last year I was “Borgognonis Jabronis,” a play on the phrase Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson used to say. I loved calling my guys a bunch of Jabronis, especially during a rough week. Don’t be sitting inside the box this year people. Reach outside.   Make your team stand out. Don't be afraid to offend people. Depending on what type of people are you your league, certain topics can be a comedic gold mine, like sodomy, jerry sandusky (or standard child molestation), more sodomy, racism, confederate flags, gay rights, living in a broken home/being adopted, etc. If someone is SO offended over a joke team name then that is their problem and you can kindly redirect them to the ESPN public league directory  Good luck this year everybody"

NYGiants,3d93av,ConcedeDota,23,Wed Jul 15 01:10:43 2015 UTC,"Well first of all, I see absolutely no chance of Dez sitting out.  It just won't happen.  It would be a fuck up of epic proportions and I just don't see it happening.  That being said, a regular season win is a win, always - they can play without Romo and Dez for all I care, it's not the Super Bowl.  I wouldn't want to win the Super Bowl against a team missing a star player, because then that deserves an asterisk, but a regular season game.....fuck it.  You think come week 17 if the Giants make the playoffs people around the league are going to say ""But they played week 1 against the Cowboys who didn't have Dez, they don't deserve to be here.""  No, they'll be saying ""Giants made the playoffs, the Cowboys didn't."""

NYGiants,3d93av,JFLTreb,2,Tue Jul 14 13:50:12 2015 UTC,"The way I see it, the whole organization is the team. If those responsible for contracts can't figure it out then that's a team weakness, its not the Giants' problem that they avoided similar situations."
NYGiants,3d93av,nklim,3,Tue Jul 14 18:23:57 2015 UTC,"Here's how I see it: you line up and play the team who lines up against you. You try to win. But beating a better team feels more rewarding. I will be happier if we win when the Cowboys have Dez. A win is a win, but some wins feel more rewarding than others. Do I want him to play? I'm not sure, but it wouldn't feel quite as good to win with him not playing.  Also, he's almost sure gonna play week 1"
NYGiants,3d93av,Iamyoutwo,3,Tue Jul 14 13:57:35 2015 UTC,"Sure, but we actually have to beat the Cowboys without Dez for any of this to matter. I'm not convinced that will be a simple task the way this offseason is going."

NYGiants,3d93av,InconditeMudlark,-18,Wed Jul 15 14:39:11 2015 UTC,I can't see how NYG can beat Dallas even without Dez. Your offensive line wasn't great without Beatty and now he's out for a while. There's no run game to worry about. The defense couldn't stop our run game and had a lot of trouble getting pressure against our o-line.  I think dez plays week 1.
NYGiants,3d93av,out_of_time,7,Tue Jul 14 14:15:11 2015 UTC,"Before the Beatty injury our line got better by drafting Flowers, moving Richburg to Center and shifting Pugh inside to OG. Unfortunately Beatty's injury will hurt us but you're DL isn't exactly top 10 (even with Hardy.) Although, it's improved, it's not improved enough. Go watch the tape of Flowers completely shutting down Gregory before you reply to this.  Your run game was not 100% because of your line. Murray is a very, very good back. As of now, you have 2 guys who strike zero fear into anyone.   Dez will play. Good for Dez. You guys are vastly overrating your team this year. You're the best in the East (barely) but you're far from the unbeatable force many of you think."
NYGiants,3d93av,InconditeMudlark,-8,Tue Jul 14 14:56:45 2015 UTC,"Go watch the tape of Flowers completely shutting down Gregory before you reply to this.   Do Giants fans really feel this way? I know there's this false narrative going around in this sub how ""Flowers forced Gregory to stay on the RT."" If you watched Gregory last year in every game he would go back and forth between the left and the right. Against Miami he had success on either side.  Here's Gregory pushing Flowers into the lap of the QB  Here's Gregory stout against Flowers, sheds the block and gets his hand on the ball carrier   People worry about Gregorys size against the run but in that play he shows he can handle a guy who outweighs him by about 75 lbs or more and still make a play.   Your run game was not 100% because of your line. Murray is a very, very good back. As of now, you have 2 guys who strike zero fear into anyone.   No not 100%... more like 75% on the o-line. Murray has repeatedly said in interviews he credits the offensive line for all his success last season. Murray didn't strike fear into anyone until a few games into the 2014 season. Randle and DMC will do the same.   Dez will play. Good for Dez. You guys are vastly overrating your team this year. You're the best in the East (barely) but you're far from the unbeatable force many of you think.   You're right, Dez will play but we aren't ""vastly overrating"" our team. No one thinks we are unbeatable. We are just confident with the team we have right now which hasn't been the case for a few years."
NYGiants,3d93av,out_of_time,4,Tue Jul 14 15:34:05 2015 UTC,"I see a lot of people posting you'll go undefeated in the East, which I think is crazy. Not just for your team but for any team, any year, to think that. The East always plays up/down to each other. It's been 10 years since anyone ran the table, it just doesn't happen that often. Even when we're at our very best, I assume 3 loses just to keep myself honest.  Yeah, 2 plays of Gregory vs. Flowers doesn't really tell the story. I think Gregory will be a good player, and he'll probably come out better than Flowers in his rookie season. Rookie LT's don't often come away smelling like roses. I'm realistic about how well he'll do for us this year. I'd much rather have him at RT. But thems the breaks. Hopefully he'll prove that he's the guy for the future. But I also hope that Beatty can come back quickly (something he doesn't generally do from injuries) and allow Flowers to move to the right. I've never really heard that narrative you speak of honestly. But like I said, Gregory will be a fine player. I didn't love any of the pass rushers who came out in this draft though. I think they'll all be fine players but none of them will be the complete package.   Of course Murray said that, he has to say that! And believe me, your line is very good. Very, very good and very, very scary. I don't think that Randle and DMC will be able to do the same. Maybe DMC, when healthy but Randle just isn't going to get it done. To say Murray didn't strike fear in anyone is way off. I think our board, collectively, has always thought of him as a top tier RB.   Lastly, you should be confident! You won the East last year and your defense got better. I think your offense took a small step back but not enough to effect you that much. Thinking DMC/Randle = Murray from last year is a stretch. Although, DMC could be a scary player. If Lee stays healthy (I hope he does) your Defense gets better right away just because of that! He's a great player and fun to watch."
NYGiants,3d93av,InconditeMudlark,-2,Tue Jul 14 15:45:58 2015 UTC,"I see a lot of people posting you'll go undefeated in the East, which I think is crazy.   They don't speak for the majority of fans. It is crazy to think any team would go undefeated in their division.    Yeah, 2 plays of Gregory vs. Flowers doesn't really tell the story   It may only be two plays but it counters this statement   Go watch the tape of Flowers completely shutting down Gregory before you reply to this.   Gregory spent a lot of time over the RT that game but even with his minimal plays against Flowers he was effective   Rookie LT's don't often come away smelling like roses. I'm realistic about how well he'll do for us this year. I'd much rather have him at RT. But thems the breaks.   I appreciate someone who is realistic when talking about their team. Ideally Beatty LT, move Pugh inside and have Flowers at RT but now you have to either move two players who played on opposite sides the year before or you force Flowers to play LT who looks more like a RT in the pros. Either way isn't good which is why I'm critical of your o-line.    I didn't love any of the pass rushers who came out in this draft though. I think they'll all be fine players but none of them will be the complete package.   I felt Gregory was the best pass rusher in the draft but dropped because of his off the field issues. People question his ability in the run game strictly because of his weight but as I showed you his length and power can make up for it. I've watched all of his games on draftbreakdown and noticed that even if he doesn't win with his speed and length against the run he doesn't stay blocked for long. I'm not worried about his run defense during his rookie season as Dallas will use Gregory primarily as a pass rusher which will give him time to add some bulk.   I don't think that Randle and DMC will be able to do the same.   Dallas doesn't need them to match Murray's production. They are going to split carries which allows them to both be successful. If one of them emerges as a ""bell cow"" then so be it but right now it's a committee approach that will get the job done.   Lastly, you should be confident! You won the East last year and your defense got better. I think your offense took a small step back but not enough to effect you that much. Thinking DMC/Randle = Murray from last year is a stretch.

NYGiants,3d93av,out_of_time,4,Tue Jul 14 17:00:45 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure 2 plays counters my statement and I think the tape I saw was a year before that anyway because I don't remember Brad Kaaya being the QB in the tape I saw, but I could be wrong. It was a while ago in all honesty. I tend to scrap tapes from college and I know that contradicts my original point but until the first pre-season game we really can't scrap them altogether.   I disagree. Flowers is a LT. Just not yet. We drafted him to eventually replace Beatty. Although, we only really keep OLmen around who can play multiple positions, Beatty being the exception to that. But he could age into a G position at some point too, who knows (a la David Diehl.) Flowers was able to use his size and strength to make up for footwork problems in college. But players rarely come out of CFB with perfect footwork. Especially when they don't really need to develop that part of their game because they're already dominating.   I understand the hope for Randle but I just don't see it, from the (very limited) 2-5 times a year I've seen him. And DMC is just such an injury risk. At some point Randle may have to be the bell-cow and that's not going to help your record. I feel like you guys finally figured out that Romo is at his very best and most dangerous when the threat to run is real. I could see you regressing to the play calling of 2 year ago and beyond. That won't be good for you. Good for us. Not good for you.   Are you sure you are a Giants fan? I haven't enjoyed talking with an opposing fan of any of NFCE team. I've tagged you as GGGF, good guy giants fan. Not creative but at least I'll know to read your comments.   Dude, I've missed maybe 10 games since 1985. I'm a fan. I'm also old enough to realize that the other teams in our divisions aren't evil, they aren't any different than our players, and the fans are just as passionate. I get rivalries, they're all in good fun but that's it...just fun. If you spend time get angry about them or come on reddit just to downvote than you're probably a real miserable fuck. We can disagree like adults and let a bunch of other (mostly) adults settle in on the field while we sit at our respective homes and get drunk all the same.

Flowers used his size/strength to be successful, like a lot of college LTs but he looked slow and doesn't have the best feet. He should be more successful at RT from the start to get used to the speed of the NFL and work on technique. I think it's advantageous for opposing teams if Flowers is the starting LT but we'll have to wait and see.

NYGiants,3d93av,InconditeMudlark,-3,Tue Jul 14 17:08:47 2015 UTC,Ya so did I. Count the snaps Gregory engaged Flowers. These two plays are too many to be made against a top 10 pick at OT.

It's pointless if you just get voted into hidden because you have an opinion.  That being said, I'm a huge Nebraska fan and was at the game in Lincoln against Miami.  Gregory did seem to have a pretty effective day imo, but I can say Flowers clearly got in his head.  Gregory was abandoning his run assignments to prove he could beat Flowers 1 on 1 by the end of the game, not disengaging at the whistle, and taking dumb personal foul penalties, in a game Nebraska led handily throughout.  It was very frustrating and one of the reasons I wanted the Giants to stay away from him (the other being he's not a good fit in a conventional 4-3 scheme, like the Giants run, I think he'd be best utilized as a Von Miller/Bruce Irvin type OLB.)"

He is not likely to sign it until he's actually able to come back and play because if he were to sign it now he will just end up on the non football injuries list, which will allow the team to not pay him for any time missed.  As far as options go, the Giants can withdraw the offer, or they can just let this situation play out. Thus far they have not responded by withdrawing the tender, but they did take the potential long-term offer they had for him off the table. I personally don't expect any action to be taken at least not until camp if they do anything."

Content is slower now since we are in the dead period (except you know the whole JPP thing) but Ed who runs the site always has something brewing. The community has pretty lively discussions as well. They have a handful of writers so you get some different perspectives on the same issues as well which is nice. Their draft coverage was really strong this year.   Inside Football had been my go to for a long time before Big Blue View took over. http://insidefootball.com/ The Blog Bits series that Pat writes every summer is always worth a read. She writes for bleacher report as well so the content is kind of spread out. I follow her on twitter now and selectively read her stuff. @Patricia_Traina She does Q and A's with fans a lot. She is good but very conservative when it comes to her analysis. Not much she is going to offer is going to be a surprise.   If you ever stumble across the big blue chat podcast on BigBlueView it is actually Ed and Pat that record it.

Ended up he could not make it because of work, so I went alone. Once I got the to game the fans there were amazing...we talked about the old days, current players, and our playoff hopes it was awesome. I will never forget the whole stadium in the 3rd qtr. chanting  ""Philadelphia Sucks! Philadelphia Sucks!  ESPN won't let me forget about us blowing the lead and DeShawn Jackson returning a put to put the game away.

NYGiants,3d69a6,KidSniffer,4,Mon Jul 13 21:27:44 2015 UTC,"Depends on the cost.  There's a price at which each one makes sense (maybe not JPP, depending on the medical), and a price at which you say goodbye.  The Giants will decide what their reservation prices are and act accordingly.  Frankly, I think all those suggested prices are on the high side of reasonable.  Amukamara is closest, but he needs to show that he can play a full season first.  It's a boring non-answer, but it's how the team operates."
NYGiants,3d69a6,3rdAnnual,3,Tue Jul 14 00:24:00 2015 UTC,Let Randle go. I'd fix prince and Paul's contracts so that we won't pay 25 mil between the two of them in one year.
NYGiants,3d69a6,MASKED_relish,3,Mon Jul 13 21:34:49 2015 UTC,"Prince and if we are top 15 in the draft, get a pass rusher to replace JPP, he'll probably cost more than it's worth."
NYGiants,3d69a6,bu77munch,2,Mon Jul 13 22:10:08 2015 UTC,Prince- Definitely  JPP- Depends on how he performs this year with the injury and his work performance
NYGiants,3d69a6,Manning2Cruz,2,Tue Jul 14 03:25:17 2015 UTC,"I think we franchise tag Prince because Eli gets a long term deal settled during the season or shortly afterward because he has the guts to play on a tag and hit FA, let Reuben walk because we are so deep unless he takes a discount, and JPP is anyone's guess right now but Moore, Diggy, and Wynn control as much of his destiny as he does right now."
NYGiants,3d69a6,xSxHxAxRxPx,2,Tue Jul 14 03:58:00 2015 UTC,"I want to keep Prince (see my flair lol). If he stays healthy he is one of the top corners in the league no doubt.   Randle played well late in the season. I think he's an above average third option and he has a chance to contribute a lot behind Cruz and OBJ. I don't think he's worth that much though, so I say let him go.   I really don't know enough to say anything about JPP."

NYGiants,3d6ji9,halsteve,2,Mon Jul 13 22:29:51 2015 UTC,Eli and Flacco are my two dark horse fantasy QBs for 2015.
NYGiants,3d6ji9,italian_trojan,2,Tue Jul 14 14:32:26 2015 UTC,"With Odell and (if healthy) Cruz, Eli can have a bounce-back year."
NYGiants,3d6ji9,JaquiskiTaterTartt,2,Fri Jul 17 02:32:15 2015 UTC,"I like the fact the writer thinks Corey will be the 4th WR. Even if it's speculation or just off of pure hope. Put that man on the field and let him go up for balls. Still high on my Corey kick, still not fading... He should be in the end zone though."
NYGiants,3d6ji9,UnityvsDivision,2,Wed Jul 15 17:15:31 2015 UTC,It's mostly hope at this point. I really liked what I saw from him in the preseason. Only thing that scares me is the money they paid Harris. I feel like that's a lot for just a kick returner.   I think Washington is a sneaky play in DFS preseason games.
NYGiants,3d56o6,I_Eat_Your_Pets,13,Mon Jul 13 16:45:46 2015 UTC,"Don't get duped by last season's final numbers. You had to watch the games to get the real story. Nine of JPP's 12.5 sacks came in the final five weeks of the season, when the Giants were completely out of the postseason race. Plus, of those five sack-happy games, four came against opponents ranked among the 10 worst teams in the NFL when it came to sacks allowed.   This has been at the front of my mind all offseason. I haven't seen a single reason to increase any offer to him, and the only reason to tag him has been a serious lack of quality players at his position on the roster. And I'm fine with that. Give him another season. Watch his health. Watch his play. Then gauge his value.  And if he has another banged-up, lackluster season, why keep him around to suck up cap space? Let the Raiders or the Titans or the Bucs throw a ton of money at him. If he plays well, fine. At least we won't have overpaid a guy who is lacking in everything our management values.  I don't necessarily think he should be crucified for being dumb. He is pretty young. But I also think he should have someone around him who he trusts and listens to that would keep him out of dangerous situations."
NYGiants,3d56o6,dbosse311,8,Mon Jul 13 17:02:29 2015 UTC,"Because this is a prevalent idea on this sub that ignores critical pieces of information I want to give some counter points.   That 9 sack streak coincides with Kiwi's injury, the backup DEs actually started causing pressure from the left side for the first time all year and JPP is suddenly showing up.  Shockingly moving JPP to the left side also got him ~4 sacks.  4/9 sacks are off Jason Peters, Tyron Smith and Trent Williams, all pro-bowlers, and a 5th was off Taylor Lewan. (Lewan has better stats than any of our lineman not named Beatty.)    So, what kind of player has Lewan been in his first year for the Titans? A pretty darn good one, actually. Pro Football Focus gives him a +2.2 grade. He has a +5.2 run-blocking grade and is hurt by having committed five penalties. Lewan has surrendered four sacks.    Let's put those numbers in some perspective.  How does Lewan compare to the offensive tackles taken ahead of him? Greg Robinson, taken second overall by the St. Louis Rams, has a -18.9 PFF score . In weeks 11 and 12, against Denver and San Diego, Robinson had a combined score of -15.4. That's Charles Brown-esque. Jake Matthews, taken sixth by the Atlanta Falcons, is ranked worst among 77 tackles graded with a -34.6 score. Yes, -34.6! He has committed 10 penalties, allowed six sacks and surrendered 33 hits or hurries.   Source"
NYGiants,3d56o6,Capt91,5,Mon Jul 13 20:56:17 2015 UTC,"Also given how he was one of our few competent run defenders last season I would not be surprised if Fewell put him in position to sell out the pass in order to defend the run.  Furthermore when saying he or any player got X sacks against bad teams you can't just leave that out of context, how many other players premier pass rushers even get a significant portion or even a majority of their sacks against bad teams."
NYGiants,3d56o6,Engineers_Disasters,3,Mon Jul 13 21:18:56 2015 UTC,Agreed. the FO let Tuck go after the same type of season
NYGiants,3d56o6,KidSniffer,3,Mon Jul 13 20:02:27 2015 UTC,And they were right. How much a force has he been in Oakland? Let JPP join him. The Raiders can become a graveyard of former Giants greats. I'm okay with that. I've always had a soft spot for the silver and black.
NYGiants,3d56o6,dbosse311,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:08:56 2015 UTC,I think this is a pretty level-headed point of view. agreed.
NYGiants,3d56o6,joesephed,3,Mon Jul 13 18:43:35 2015 UTC,"The only reason I think the tag made sense for this year was how devoid we were of talent on our defensive line. The cupboard is bare, and we were left with little choice. But, I completely agree that's he not  worth $14M/year let alone a long term deal. Luckily, we know the Giants FO don't overspend on their own guys for the most part."
NYGiants,3d56o6,saudade44,3,Mon Jul 13 17:58:56 2015 UTC,"I think the Giants are pretty much screwed.  JPP is not likely worth the franchise tag right now, but the alternative is to let him go for nothing -  not even a compensatory pick. Best option is likely exactly what they are doing...  Wait and see."
NYGiants,3d56o6,AlfredRWallace,6,Mon Jul 13 21:16:23 2015 UTC,"I personally am sick of JPP. He has been less than stellar but he doesn´t seem to have much drive or desire to really improve, from what I´ve seen. This was the icing on the cake for me. Realistically we need him to have any shot at the playoffs, but after this season I would have no problem with cutting his ass and letting some other team overpay him."
NYGiants,3d56o6,Octodab,2,Mon Jul 13 17:20:05 2015 UTC,"Realistically we need him to have any shot at the playoffs,   What if we used the 15 million to pick up Evan Mathis, Jake Long, and a veteran defensive lineman?

NYGiants,3d56o6,Octodab,5,Tue Jul 14 22:56:29 2015 UTC,No one is taking JPP's actions personally. It's all business in the FO. All spags needs to do is move him to the left side and stop letting his ego play against left tackles then his numbers will shoot up. It doesn't matter that he's over paid because there are no other free agents who would be better investments this year.
NYGiants,3d56o6,xSxHxAxRxPx,2,Mon Jul 13 18:29:43 2015 UTC,Evan Mathis and Jake Long?
NYGiants,3d56o6,philasurfer,5,Mon Jul 13 20:07:56 2015 UTC,"The reason we didn't sign Jake Long is because he isn't healthy.  The reason we wont sign Evan Mathis is because we need a left tackle, not a left guard."
NYGiants,3d56o6,muhalphabuild,3,Tue Jul 14 02:21:16 2015 UTC,One is over paid and the other is over weight
NYGiants,3d56o6,xSxHxAxRxPx,0,Mon Jul 13 20:08:41 2015 UTC,"Maybe so, but we would have a top 5 offense with them."
NYGiants,3d56o6,philasurfer,2,Mon Jul 13 20:11:45 2015 UTC,That makes zero sense
NYGiants,3d56o6,KidSniffer,3,Mon Jul 13 20:01:19 2015 UTC,"I agree that it was always unlikely that Jason was going to be a $14.8M-level player for the Giants in 2015, and the explosion of his dominant hand makes that unlikelihood into a near-impossibility.    The endgame might well play out with a rescinded Tender, but there's no reason to rush.  They could save some cash, but Jason isn't going to sign the Tender any time soon, and there is no immediate use for which that cash is needed.  No free agents out there right now represent a good value proposition, or would be so expensive that the Giants would need the Tender money to sign them.  If they end up saving the money, they'll be doing so to extend a veteran or to carry space forward to 2016-- nothing that needs to happen in the next 2 months.    Plus, it's pretty skeezy to cut a guy loose while he's still in the hospital.  Let him go home and settle in first before reaching out again.  Float that they'd be open to some contractual NFI protection, but condition any negotiation on their medical folks getting a look at him.  See how that goes and make a decision only when you have to."
NYGiants,3d56o6,3rdAnnual,3,Mon Jul 13 23:25:39 2015 UTC,i think after this season people will feel silly for doubting JPPs ability to be an absolute monster.  spags is going to give us back 2011 JPP.
NYGiants,3d56o6,poorlytimed-erection,4,Mon Jul 13 19:42:16 2015 UTC,"I'm sure he's going to 'return to 2011 form' any minute now!  He has been lackluster since 2012. I understand the concept of optimism, but this is a guy who gave us one great season in 2011, followed by 3 arguably crappy ones, and is now going to go into a 5th with 4 fingers after a careless accident. What have you done for me lately, JPP? The answer is not much"
NYGiants,3d56o6,KidSniffer,2,Mon Jul 13 20:04:20 2015 UTC,"the reason for JPPs return to form will be due to a better scheme that will play towards his strengths, a better rotation at DE to allow him more rest between snaps, and the motivation of earning a large contract, if not with the giants, with another team. seeing as he may not be playing every game this season, he has even fewer chances to earn that contract.   he is a freak athlete and will quickly learn to compensate for the loss of his index finger.   not to mention, JPP was a force against the run last season, to call his season ""crappy"" because he didnt put up eye popping stats is ridiculous."
NYGiants,3d56o6,poorlytimed-erection,0,Tue Jul 14 03:20:33 2015 UTC,"a better rotation at DE   What offseason have you been following? We have a disappointing Moore, a rookie, and Ayers.    JPP was a force against the run   Yeah he was great containing Russel Wilson."
NYGiants,3d56o6,KidSniffer,2,Tue Jul 14 13:01:35 2015 UTC,"if you dont think our rotation at DE this year is better than last year than thats ridiculous. to call moore ""disappointing"" is also ridiculous, he is one of the most promising young players on the team. and to insinuate that the giants inability to contain a QB with a 4.5 40 (who rushed for over 800 yards last season) is an indictment against JPPs run defense is just stupid."
NYGiants,3d56o6,poorlytimed-erection,0,Tue Jul 14 13:56:00 2015 UTC,"If you watched that game you'd know it was repeated lack of discipline, not lack of athleticism that made JPP bite on the run every time instead of containing the QB (doing his job). The announcers were even all over it"
NYGiants,3d56o6,KidSniffer,1 point,Tue Jul 14 22:00:52 2015 UTC,I wouldn't say JPP was crappy last year.  He was one of the best run defenders in the league and by the end of the year was looking good rushing the passer.

NYGiants,3d1mrw,ConcedeDota,2,Mon Jul 13 06:41:06 2015 UTC,"Here is what I can tell you:  You best bet at this point is to get tickets from www.StubHub.com or the NFL ticket exchange. Keep in mind that this is going to be THE most in-demand game of the whole season for tickets. The two teams share a stadium, thus you have twice as many fans from the same geographical region all trying to fill the same exact stadium. Don't expect to pay less than $150 - $200 per ticket.  Secondly, as others said, it's December so it is going to be cold. Like...freezing cold. Make sure you wear the right clothing. Many layers upon many layers, especially if you sit in those upper levels with the wind it gets brutal.  As of right now it's a 1pm game (I believe this is one of the Flex games) meaning that the NFL might decide (If both teams have a good record) to move the game to the 4pm time slot (This time slot is reserved for the ""game of the week"" on FOX). Just keep that in mind as the season goes on.  Lastly, soak in the atmosphere! Get to the game by 10am via NJ Transit (Train) or by Taxi (Or Uber). I would bring some beer with you and roam the parking lot getting friendly with the fans. Keep in mind since both teams are in the same area, you're going to have a wide mix of Jets and Giants fans. I have never had a problem with Giants fans, best fans in the game IMO, so if you have some beer I'm sure someone would be willing to trade some warmth and food.  As far as accommodations go, there should be affordable hotels in the Jersey City area."

NYGiants,3d1mrw,I_Eat_Your_Pets,2,Tue Jul 14 06:07:11 2015 UTC,"Looks like you've got just about what you need.  So as far as the beer: Yes you can bring it on the train and you can even drink it on the train (be somewhat discrete...but plenty will be drinking). HOWEVER: Do not walk around drinking an open can between the train and the parking lot, bring a bag for your empties. It's fine to drink open containers within the parking lot but you might have a hard time if you're drinking a beer while walking from the train to the parking lot."
NYGiants,3d14m8,lolibet,1 point,Sun Jul 12 17:32:06 2015 UTC,So realistically he might not be playing until maybe week 4-5? I'm basing this from 8 weeks to heal from this coming week plus after (hopefully) passing a physical and practicing with the new defensive scheme until Spags/Coughlin is comfortable starting him. If he's smart he should get together with Spags now and start going over the play book while he's doing rehab and healing. Learn the routes and the set up for plays. That way when he comes back to practice he'll have some knowledge of what Spags is doing so he can get back in the game faster. I know he's a UFA now but if the Giants are willing to keep him after this shit show then he should at least be preparing for his job somewhat while he's sitting out healing. Either way I hope he gets better real soon and can be able to have a somewhat functioning hand both on and off the field.  Edit: I just realized that he might not be able to go over the playbook with Spags since he isn't signed with the team technically. He might not be allowed to look at it. Does anyone know if that's true or not? If so then he should actually sit down and talk with the FO and see if they'll pay him if he ends up on NFI list.

But Mara is one of the most respected people in the history of the league (even the ball is nicknamed after him). Gifford is really the ""face"" of the 50s when the Giants, and the NFL, started becoming absolutely huge.

NYGiants,3czit2,theverybest27,5,Sun Jul 12 12:55:53 2015 UTC,Tarkenton was in no way a better QB for the Giants than Eli is though and you couldn't even make the argument. This is a Giant's MT. Rushmore so I'd say you'd have to ignore any bits of career players have had with other teams when considering them.

NYGiants,3czit2,BBBelmont,3,Sun Jul 12 13:25:36 2015 UTC,"His career with giants was very short, but he did win us 3 Eastern Division Titles, eventually losing 3 consecutive championships. He won the mvp multiple times as a gmen and set the nfl record for passing touchdowns in a game and in a season in a giants uniform (season wasn't broken until Marino in 84 and he still is tied for 7 in a single game - he threw no INT's in that as well fun fact), he was the first qb to ever throw for 30 touchdowns in consecutive seasons.  He's not the franchise qb that Eli is and has been, and you're correct in saying he likely doesn't deserve a spot in the 4some over Eli, but he did have several huge contributions to the qb position in a giants uniform, and the bloody picture of him is badass as hell.  I'm fine revising my fearsome foursome to: Eli, Strahan, lt, huff - just thought this chain was less about the actual 4 people and more about remembering some giant greats."
NYGiants,3czit2,dagaboy,0,Sun Jul 12 13:51:27 2015 UTC,"During his four years with he Giants, Tittle was the best QB in the NFL. He set the season TD record in 62, then broke it in 63. That record stood until Marino. He set the team season yardage record that stood until Simms in 84. He had a 505 yard 7 TD game (second most yardage at the time and still tied for most TDs), and a 6 TD game when injured. He still hods the Giants record for yards per attempt.

NYGiants,3cy7x2,3rdAnnual,2,Sun Jul 12 02:12:00 2015 UTC,"I want to believe that he would never leave the Giants no matter what, but I would have said the same about Peyton and the Colts a few years back too. I'm getting kind of nervous that there might be something going on between Eli and the organization that's holding this up."
NYGiants,3cy7x2,KingDusty,5,Sun Jul 12 04:10:57 2015 UTC,Peyton had a career threatening neck injury and Andrew Luck was waiting to be picked first in the draft. Those 2 reasons combined are the only reason Peyton isn't retiring a Colt. The situations are vastly different. Eli will most likely (I only say most likely because it is the NFL and you never truly know) be a Giant for life.
NYGiants,3cy7x2,theverybest27,2,Sun Jul 12 13:18:28 2015 UTC,Eli needs to retire a Giant.

They don't need additional cap space this season and he's not going anywhere. I could see him playing this season getting the franchise tag the season after that and if he doesn't suck at this point you can give him a new contract. Unless he gets injured or his play declines noticeably, I'm pretty sure he's going to be our QB for another 4 years or so"

NYGiants,3cy45a,SevenwithaT,8,Sat Jul 11 20:47:45 2015 UTC,I want Landon Collins to impress  I think Corey Washington will impress the most
NYGiants,3cy45a,_newyorkgiants_,3,Sat Jul 11 21:10:03 2015 UTC,Yessss. Landon Collins and Ereck Flowers both have HUGE roles to play this year. I would be ecstatic if either of them was impressing during TC/preseason
NYGiants,3cy45a,Sexterminator,2,Sun Jul 12 05:48:27 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I can't wait to see Flowers against some real competition in the preseason.  There are going to be some major growing pains, especially in the passing game, but I have a feeling Flowers is really going to excel in the run game.  Maybe not at first, but he'll get the hang of it pretty quickly I bet.  The kid did 37 reps in the bench press at the combine, 98th percentile among OTs.  If he can be an effective run game and the core of Pugh, Richburg, Schwartz is a good as the coaches seem to think it is then we might see a huge turn around in our run game.  I'm very excited for what this OL could do in the run game even with Beatty gone.  Pass protecting is another story, and I'm a little scared to find out what that's going to be like.  But again, if the interior of the line plays well in pass pro and Eli has a pocket to step up into then we should be ok given how quickly he tends to get the ball out in the new offense."
NYGiants,3cy45a,THATBUSFROMSPEED,1 point,Sun Jul 12 14:40:43 2015 UTC,I'm big on Collins. Great pick atop the second round.
NYGiants,3cy45a,JaquiskiTaterTartt,4,Fri Jul 17 02:33:53 2015 UTC,I want it to be Victor Cruz with Ereck Flowers being a close second (at LT).  I think it will be Larry Donnell.

NYGiants,3cy45a,luckyshamrok19,3,Sun Jul 12 03:25:17 2015 UTC,"Offensively, I want it to be Reuben Randle. He's gotten better every year he's been in the league and came on strong to end the season, so I'd love to see him take that next step. I bet most of the focus will be on Flowers though, especially if he holds his own (as I expect him to, for the most part).   Defensively, it's difficult to say. I don't expect Collins to be a stud from Day 1. I love his tenacity and drive, but rookies tend to make mistakes.. especially in coverage. I'll say it'll be Devon Kennard- With his speed and athleticism, I bet Spags will have him blitzing a lot more often than he did last season, and he'll prove why he belongs on the field this season."

I use my index finger a lot and it's not life-threatening to him in any way.  The index finger isn't particularly important for grip strength and his middle finger (assuming it was a full amputation which I've heard it was) will move down and function as his index finger.  Honestly, it sucks and I'm sure he's kicking himself every hour of every day but his broken thumb is more threatening to his season at this point. Then again, I'm not a doctor so I'm just basing this on what I've heard on the radio and read in reports."
NYGiants,3curih,out_of_time,2,Fri Jul 10 23:32:09 2015 UTC,"Maybe I have missed it, but one thing no one is talking about is that JPP isn't going to be able to do his weightlifting program- at least any time soon. It's all behind the scenes, and it's easy for everyone to forget, but the weightlifting is essential to competing on an NFL defensive line.  I have a funny feeling that we're going to see a weak version of JPP this year.  EDIT: It's been a while. I need to change my 26 flair. It's sad. Rolle and JPP were my 2 favorite Giants. Yeah, and I guess Eli is pretty cool."

NYGiants,3csuor,3rdAnnual,10,Fri Jul 10 14:25:35 2015 UTC,I don't blame him. It's good for both the Giants and JPP to know whether he can perform the right way or not
NYGiants,3csuor,Sailor_Chris,6,Fri Jul 10 14:50:09 2015 UTC,"Definitely not good for the Giants.  They want to get their medical folks to take a look at him as early as possible so that they know where they stand.  They also want to get him into the meeting room so that he can start learning Spagnuolo's defense.  If he shows up physically ready to play the week before the opener, he's probably not getting much playing time at all for the first several weeks of the season because he won't know his assignments."
NYGiants,3csuor,Engineers_Disasters,4,Fri Jul 10 14:57:31 2015 UTC,They already said they are keeping him and that probably means the tag is staying on the table.  So whether the medical folks look at him or not that probably won't change anything.  Missing the meetings are important but more important is missing practice time which he can't do until he is healthy anyway so not signing the tag doesn't change that.  Overall I'm more encouraged by his attitude to avoid the NFI list than I am dismayed that he will be missing meetings.  This situation sucks but it could have been so much worse.
NYGiants,3csuor,ProbablyJustArguing,3,Fri Jul 10 15:08:39 2015 UTC,"Alternately, what if the leaked recovery prognosis is wildly inaccurate, and the Giants would probably revoke the Tender the minute their doctors got a look at him?  You'd see exactly the same behavior from JPP as you do now.    He's treating the team as his enemy.  There's no evidence that the team would use an NFI designation to withhold salary-- they would have the right to, but they don't have to.  He's assuming the worst about management without even having a conversation with them."
NYGiants,3csuor,Sailor_Chris,3,Fri Jul 10 16:23:45 2015 UTC,"He's treating the team as his enemy.   I've always thought that Osi must have sat him down and told him something to the effect of ""don't trust the front office here, no matter what"" because he's playing the Giants like Osi did."

NYGiants,3csuor,xinik,1 point,Fri Jul 10 16:39:36 2015 UTC,Yeah but JPP signing tag means that NYG can put him in NFi list and not pay him some of his contract ... which is why JPP wants to avoid NFi as much as possible.
NYGiants,3csuor,ProbablyJustArguing,2,Fri Jul 10 15:14:38 2015 UTC,There was a leaked story saying the Giants would pay him if he would just sign the damn tender and show up -- NFI or no. Teams don't have to with hold pay for a player on NFI but they can. They can also come to an agreement like Jason Peters did with the Eagles in 2012 -- Peters agent is the same as JPP's. Those details could be agreed to before the tender is signed.
NYGiants,3csuor,derpoftheirish,1 point,Fri Jul 10 17:08:19 2015 UTC,"So whether the medical folks look at him or not that probably won't change anything.    It will, it stops the Giants from being able to put him on the NFI list, which I think they'd want to do if he can't go right away.  If he can't play/practice until week two, then he might as well sit for 4 more weeks because the Giants can have his Roster spot for someone who's ready to go day one.   Overall I'm more encouraged by his attitude to avoid the NFI list   I'm not.  Either he can go or he can't.  If he's just dragging his feet to make sure he makes his money, then I'm not encouraged by that at all, because as I said above, we don't get his roster spot until it's likely too late to leverage it."
NYGiants,3csuor,ProbablyJustArguing,2,Fri Jul 10 17:49:25 2015 UTC,"Week 2 of preseason is the target, not regular season.

If he signs it's either tie up the roster spot or sit him for 6 weeks."

NYGiants,3csuor,nyg1,2,Fri Jul 10 16:02:06 2015 UTC,"My opinion is that once the Giants and JPP come to an agreement about his recovery time and not putting him on the NFI he will sign.   The broken thumb will be healed around the 21st of August, his Split thickness skin graft will heal in 2-3 weeks as long as it takes and doctors don't have to redo the blood supply connection.  Our first game isn't until Sep 13th so JPP will have three weeks to rehab that thumb if it's needed, kinda get used to hitting again and sometime to adjust to his new hand.  Best case scenario is he gets our of the hospital Sunday or Monday and meets with the Giants shortly after.  They work things out, he signs and is in the film room and with the team at the start of camp.  He starts suiting up the last week of August and starts week 1."

Embarrassment is a strong motivator to hide your mistakes."
NYGiants,3cut6z,zach1209,2,Fri Jul 10 23:44:16 2015 UTC,"I agree, the Giants have already set aside that chunk of the salary cap for him. So let him play out the season and see what he can do. If it's a disaster, well just let him walk after the season."

NYGiants,3cut6z,ProbablyJustArguing,1 point,Sat Jul 11 01:37:09 2015 UTC,"Ok, so then you make the case for me.  Why keep him?  Do it with some statistical argument with his play over the last 2 years."
NYGiants,3cut6z,moldy_films,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:33:35 2015 UTC,"Because this is a prevalent idea on this sub that ignores critical pieces of information I want to give some counter points.   That 9 sack streak coincides with Kiwi's injury, the backup DEs actually started causing pressure from the left side for the first time all year and JPP is suddenly showing up. Shockingly moving JPP to the left side also got him ~4 sacks. 4/9 sacks are off Jason Peters, Tyron Smith and Trent Williams, all pro-bowlers, and a 5th was off Taylor Lewan. (Lewan has better stats than any of our lineman not named Beatty.)   So, what kind of player has Lewan been in his first year for the Titans? A pretty darn good one, actually. Pro Football Focus gives him a +2.2 grade. He has a +5.2 run-blocking grade and is hurt by having committed five penalties. Lewan has surrendered four sacks.   Let's put those numbers in some perspective.  How does Lewan compare to the offensive tackles taken ahead of him? Greg Robinson, taken second overall by the St. Louis Rams, has a -18.9 PFF score . In weeks 11 and 12, against Denver and San Diego, Robinson had a combined score of -15.4. That's Charles Brown-esque. Jake Matthews, taken sixth by the Atlanta Falcons, is ranked worst among 77 tackles graded with a -34.6 score. Yes, -34.6! He has committed 10 penalties, allowed six sacks and surrendered 33 hits or hurries.  Source  You can thank /u/capt91 for that"
NYGiants,3cut6z,ProbablyJustArguing,1 point,Tue Jul 14 00:00:49 2015 UTC,Okay fine I'm still not sold on spending 14 million dollars on this year given that it's likely his production will go down considering his loss of strength in his hand. I just don't see the value.
NYGiants,3cut6z,moldy_films,1 point,Tue Jul 14 00:02:54 2015 UTC,I would completely agree with you... At the end of the year. Let's see what happens first.
NYGiants,3cut6z,ProbablyJustArguing,1 point,Tue Jul 14 00:06:48 2015 UTC,So you don't get to get your money back at the end of the year...
NYGiants,3cut6z,3rdAnnual,5,Tue Jul 14 00:32:42 2015 UTC,"I was one of those who thought that it was a mistake to use the Tag this spring.  To me, it came down to 3 points:  1) I didn't (and don't) see 2015 as a year when NYG is particularly likely to be a contender, 2) I really don't think it's likely that a tagged JPP signs an extension in 2016 to stay with the team that tagged him, and 3) I didn't think his play in 2015 would live up to the FT salary.    Overpaying a guy for 1 more year makes sense when you're a 12-4 contender, but not when you're a 6-10 team looking to rebuild.  Invest that money in a long-term resource that will still be relevant when the team is ready to compete seriously again, not in a 1-year patch to make the short-term less painful.  Plus, letting him walk would get the comp pick a year earlier than otherwise.  Now, he's even less likely to live up to the Tender contract, and the comp pick is no longer a factor.  There are only 2 real reasons to hang on to him right now.  First is the reputational effect-- the rest of the League will see NYG sticking by their player even through a devastating accident.  That helps in recruitment and retention.  (Just to pick one example, Steve Weatherford has mentioned that he agreed to terms with the Giants in part because another veteran kicking specialist recommended the organization so strongly.)  Second is the one that I don't want to think about-- that the Powers That Be in the organization are too invested in short-term success to do the right thing for the long-term best interests of the club.  It's cruel to cut a guy loose while he's in the hospital, so I wouldn't do it just yet.  I can forgive him spurning the Giants' envoys as a side effect of his being too distraught and/or doped up after his accident to talk business.  After he's home and settled in, though, try to talk again, and reassure him that the team wouldn't use an NFI designation to dock his pay.  But if that doesn't work and he still doesn't show for camp (which seems likely), retract the Tender and cut him loose.  The cost is too high and the potential return is too low."
NYGiants,3cut6z,Rutawitz,3,Sat Jul 11 01:20:27 2015 UTC,and the other 31 teams will all try to pick him up.
NYGiants,3cut6z,3rdAnnual,2,Sat Jul 11 00:53:45 2015 UTC,"Perhaps, but none of them will offer $14.8M for 1 season.  They know he's not worth that much."
NYGiants,3cut6z,ablebodiedmango,2,Sat Jul 11 01:33:51 2015 UTC,"The article is dumb, short sighted, and doesn't take into account anything about the logistics of the current issue.  Schein completely ignores almost every aspect that would favor the GIants keeping him - including the NFI list and not paying JPP for games he doesn't play anyway.  They won't pay him for as long as he can't perform and coaches will be able to evaluate if he can do his job.  If he refuses to sign the tender he doesn't play anywhere else anyway.  That locker room cancer shit is overrated.  Coughlin has a firm enough control of this locker room now.  Schein doesn't seem to get paid for 'analyzing' anything."
NYGiants,3cut6z,ProbablyJustArguing,-1,Sat Jul 11 16:09:35 2015 UTC,"Valid points here. While I don't think we should cut him loose, I do think we need to keep it in perspective exactly what kind of player JPP really is. He's not Strahan. And according this this article, he's barely the equivalent of an aging Justin Tuck.  Do I think he can be great? Well despite being underwhelming the past few seasons, when given his freakish natural ability, yes I still thought he had time to ascend. Now, though, its tough to envision anything like that.  I'm sure the Giants brass are weighing similar things at this very moment."

It's not like this guy was snorting a line and running a sex trafficking ring.

He might have had another when the Giants accidentally sent 10 defenders to cover 11 Bengals in the second half.

It was fine when it was keeping David Wilson or Chad Jones on the roster for an extra year of pity salary and on-the-house medical care-- the cost there was basically a rounding error in the team's cap calculations.  This, on the other hand, is a pretty serious pile of cash.  (There's no worthy use for it out there right now, but it'd carry over to 2016, when the team is more likely to be a contender, anyway.)"

People like to forget that Plax was carrying a gun for self protection. Steve Smith (not Carolina) was robbed at gunpoint for his chain 1-2 weeks prior and I know another Giant player was either robbed or attempted to be robbed (may have been Michael Johnson?) in that same month. Plax was only carrying that gun that night as a reaction to what was going on with his teammates.  Neither JPP nor Plax wanted to hurt themselves, their team, or the organization but it's so easy to pile on top of them for making a mistake when we'd all want to defend ourselves if we could and we would all light off fireworks on the 4th of July if we had mortars and a lighter. I view both of those things as completely normal. At the end of the day it's impossible to strip all of the NFL Players off-the-field rights for activities without putting them in a literal bubble."

JPP broke the law by using fireworks (hurts thousands a year, is illegal) and straight up blows up his hand, now we should coddle him and anyone who criticizes him for doing this blatantly stupid thing is a bad fan.   You're goddamn hypocrites. And let's not forget JPP refused to meet with the Giants, trying to hide or some shit. As a Giants fan and not a JPP fan this entire situation pisses me off to no end."

It really sucks for him in life but I'm not that concerned about it affecting his play physically, he's not a QB, WR, C or anything like that.  Obviously I'd rather he be whole but I'm more worried about how long it will take him to get used to playing without it mentally."

Repairing a damaged nerve and leaving the hand intact would likely have taken a lengthy rehabilitation process, not to mention no guarantee that it's ever even close to the same.  Taking it off shortens that recovery time significantly, and puts it all on JPP's brain being able to compensate and getting comfortable with his new hand as quickly as he can."

NYGiants,3clyyp,BradyandBondscheatin,1 point,Thu Jul 9 03:40:08 2015 UTC,"Kevin Roenbeck, New Jersey hand surgeon, cautioned against expecting too much too soon. Based on the medical chart, which the doctor said was an operating room schedule, Roenbeck noted the entire bone was amputated, all the way into his palm, including his entire knuckle. The strength in JPP’s right hand may never be the same. “That cannot be dismissed,” Roenbeck said. “There’s no guarantee he can be the same defensive end he was. It changes your hand forever and narrows the palm.” Some people lose up to 35 percent of their strength when losing an index finger, others as little as 5 to 10 percent, Roenbeck said.   That is gangsta talk for JPP will never be a pro bowler again!"

NYGiants,3clyyp,petwar83,1 point,Thu Jul 9 12:30:27 2015 UTC,"My Dad made a good point, and I think the original source was the Post:  It'll be interesting to hear why JPP shut out the Giants when they came down, or if he was even aware that they were there (given all the surgeries). The Giants traditionally do the ""right thing"" in these situations:   Remember Chad Jones? Drafted, car accident, almost lost his leg. The Giants knew he wasn't going to play but kept him around and on the payroll so that he didn't have to worry about finances during his recovery. David Wilson. Great future, let him retire and I believe still paid him quite a bit after the fact, and even if they ""had"" to I don't remember hearing anything about a dispute or anything even remotely negative about the situation from the Giants; well-being came first.   I'd have to think that JPP would've been dealt with in a similar fashion, especially with a long-term deal on the table. If I had to guess, I'd think the Giants would have been fine signing him to a long-term deal and allowing him to take the route towards a longer recovery, with hopes of keeping the finger and being stable for the future, rather than going the quick route and hoping to play right away to earn the money. Now I don't know what's on the table."

None of us know the exact circumstances of what happened, so we should reserve judgment until we know the facts. Even then, we should try to sympathize with a young man and father going through a difficult situation.   Secondly, JPP is an elite professional athlete. He is taller, faster, and stronger than all but a few hundred people on the planet. His job is to find and tackle the man with the football. That shouldn't be much of a problem for a freak athlete, even one with nine fingers. It's rare to see plays where DEs are hanging off a QB or ball carrier with just one hand pulling the jersey. If JPP is otherwise healthy, there will probably be one or two plays maximum per season where this hampers his ability to make a tackle. His back injury was much more of an impediment than this will ever be.   tl;dr: We need JPP to demolish people, not play the fucking piano."

I've been to 4 Giants games and have had the VIP parking for 3 of them, It's very much worth it. You're very close to at least one of the entrance gates for the stadium so there's not too much walking to be done. As for the general pass I'm not exactly sure if that grants you access to the premium lots. I'm not sure about shuttles either since I drive to games myself.

I have a sick giants cornhole and a grill that I set up with friends so we all split the cost ($20/person) and I covered food. It makes for a great time especially during the night games. You can get blue for about $40 on stub hub and red for about $80 on stubhub/ticket master. As for getting out after the games, it's never taken me more than 30-45 minutes to get to the turnpike so 2 hours is pushing it. If it's a blowout win/loss then getting out will be easier because you/other people are leaving before everyone is. Good luck and go big blue :)"

He's not the sharpest tool in the shed, but he needs to prove he can still play to get that pay day. I think he will have a pretty good year considering this, and the fact that he'll have a general chip on his shoulder for not being paid already/ and beeing seen as an idiot. I am calling it now. 15 sacks from JPP."
NYGiants,3cmu4p,Lextreme21,3,Thu Jul 9 04:10:14 2015 UTC,I hope to god you're right. We need JPP back and pissed off. He can be a beast with the extra drive to prove to himself and others that he can overcome shit like this.

NYGiants,3cmu4p,ZeroAntagonist,2,Thu Jul 9 16:23:19 2015 UTC,Doesn't matter though. He has to perform if he wants a good contract from ANY team. This is the year all the teams will either use for or against him in negotiations. He'll have to show he can perform at a high level with a missing finger if he wants a big pay day anywhere.
NYGiants,3cmu4p,EliTheGod,2,Thu Jul 9 23:50:17 2015 UTC,I really hope this puts a chip on his shoulder and he goes out there and fucks shit up with 9 fingers.

Then we sign him for like a 3 year 9-10 mill/yr deal TYAT allows him to get another shot at FA after proving himself again. Then he goes out and beasts it for two years to prove he's still got it.

NYGiants,3cmii2,12thsonofthelama,2,Fri Jul 10 01:54:49 2015 UTC,"Pretty similar. The source I read earlier saying it was an automatic six games seems to be wrong but this article outlines it pretty well. •  It's for injuries that occurred away from the field. This obviously applies to Pierre-Paul. Lighting fireworks had little to do with his job of playing football.   • Players on NFI do not get paid, or get compensated an agreed amount less than their full contract.   • Since Pierre-Paul technically wasn't under contract, the Giants need to get the active/NFI designation approved by the league.   • The NFI designation is similar to the PUP list. Once the season begins the player can return any time after Week 6. Teams have s three-week window after Week 6 to make a decision.   • Players do not count against the 90 and 53-man rosters on the NFI list during the regular season.  http://www.nj.com/giants/index.ssf/2015/07/jason_pierre-paul_fallout_what_is_nfi_and_why_he_s.html"

I really hope I'm wrong and JPP just turned them away because he wanted some privacy with his family. I doubt that's the case though. If it truly is that bad of an injury to where he refuses to meet with officials for fear of losing his spot on the team this season/next season then maybe we should start looking for temporary (permanent?) replacement for him."
NYGiants,3ckpy0,Lextreme21,16,Wed Jul 8 18:01:40 2015 UTC,"I doubt it's because he's so horribly injured he doesn't want the Giants to find out.  They'll find out the extent of his injuries eventually anyway, he's not getting a dime from them no matter what until they do, and if it was so terrible you'd think he'd want to be with the world-class physicians in NY, as opposed to those in South Florida.  I think this is more about him being a whiny baby about getting his long term offer sheet pulled, and freezing out the front office.  He's handling it extremely immaturely, and I'm personally sick of his shit.  EDIT: Fuck me, I was wrong"
NYGiants,3ckpy0,darkeagle91,3,Wed Jul 8 18:53:48 2015 UTC,"I hope you're right about him being a whiny baby, since that means his injuries aren't too bad. If he is doing this for attention or just being a dick then he needs to grow the hell up."

NYGiants,3ckpy0,Alicenator,5,Wed Jul 8 21:14:10 2015 UTC,The big question is if this injury is catastrophic what does he gain by the team not seeing him.  The only thing I can think of is that (and I'm not 100% on this) is that the Giants can't withdraw the franchise tag after July 15.  However whatever time he spends on the non-football injury list is money we get back so if my knowledge on this cap stuff is correct he still gains nothing or only gains money relative to how much he can play.  Right now I'm just confused at what JPP thinks he is doing.
NYGiants,3ckpy0,FootballGiants,3,Wed Jul 8 18:56:57 2015 UTC,I'm glad the organization isn't getting screwed out of money over this. What kind of offer from the Giants did he turn down? I think I read 60 mil but I never saw for how many years.

NYGiants,3ckpy0,JeffersonPutnam,8,Wed Jul 8 18:06:52 2015 UTC,"We can be pretty confident in a few things:  He hurt himself on 7/4.  He's still in the hospital on 7/8.  NYG sent Ronnie Barnes and Jessie Armstead to check up on him, and they left disappointed.  Jason had no legal obligation to see them, and decided not to for whatever reason, whether it's embarrassment, fear, resentment, or self-interested calculation.   Altogether, it doesn't paint a pretty picture."
NYGiants,3ckpy0,3rdAnnual,4,Wed Jul 8 18:16:19 2015 UTC,"For sure, it looks very bad.  You can certainly infer it's a very, very serious injury.   It's just silly to speculate about motives and a potential time-table for his return.  We don't even know what the injury is yet."
NYGiants,3ckpy0,JeffersonPutnam,2,Wed Jul 8 18:18:17 2015 UTC,"When you jerk around an NFL football team/your employer in a hospital lobby for 3 days, something isn't right. Sure it's dumb to speculate on specifics but it is 100% fair to speculate that shit is not good."
NYGiants,3ckpy0,cracked6,3,Wed Jul 8 18:38:22 2015 UTC,"I'm trying not to jump to conclusions here, but I can't think of a reason why JPP wouldn't let team doctors see him if he wasn't hiding something. I could understand him wanting privacy, but idk if that's warranted in this situation where his employers, who are paying him millions for his physical abilities, want to see him to make sure he's ok. Regardless, I hope he's not seriously hurt."
NYGiants,3ckpy0,relive,6,Wed Jul 8 18:12:26 2015 UTC,"Basically, apart from being a courteous guy, Jason has no real incentive to cooperate with the team right now.  This is true regardless of the severity of the injury."
NYGiants,3ckpy0,3rdAnnual,2,Wed Jul 8 18:33:22 2015 UTC,"While he doesn't have incentive, he also doesn't have incentive to keep them in the dark unless shit is horrible. The Giants are not going to revoke the franchise and let him just hit free agency, he's on the Giants till 2016. He can either play for the Giants or not play at all. Of course the Giants will probably put him on NPI list which saves them money, but being antagonistic with the Giants when they have almost all the leverage seems stupid and not beneficial to JPP. The Giants after having guys in So. Florida for half a week and getting shutout are less likely to be sympathetic and pay him the least amount possible for sure.   Either way I don't see this working out good for 2016 negotiations and JPP is probably gone regardless."
NYGiants,3ckpy0,cracked6,1 point,Wed Jul 8 18:43:17 2015 UTC,"IMO, the almost-certain futility of 2016 negotiations was decided months ago when they tagged him in the first place.  He was never going to be coming back after the FT contract expired."

NYGiants,3ckpy0,cracked6,1 point,Wed Jul 8 18:55:35 2015 UTC,"That was the case I made at the time-- overpaying for just 1 more year can be a smart move for a 12-4 team looking to extend its championship window, but for a 6-10 team looking to rebuild, it's better to devote those resources to rebuilding, rather than marginally improving very weak championship odds in the interim year(s)."
NYGiants,3ckpy0,3rdAnnual,1 point,Wed Jul 8 19:07:49 2015 UTC,I agree. This whole firework mess really ruined his chances of getting a good contract with the Giants next season or other potential teams. You made a good point about the Giants having all the leverage right now. Who knows if he's being dumb and just refusing to talk or if he's hiding the fact his hand is severely injured. Either way I wish this didn't happened. I'm worried about JPP but I'm also worried about our already unstable team.
NYGiants,3ckpy0,Lextreme21,1 point,Wed Jul 8 18:55:15 2015 UTC,"Not that it's much different, might be worse actually, but they didn't send doctors to look at him, they sent Ronnie Barnes and Jessie Armstead to check on him."
NYGiants,3ckpy0,klitchell,3,Wed Jul 8 18:57:27 2015 UTC,"More than likely his agent is telling him not to meet with the giants brass under any circumstances until he's out of hospital. JPP currently has no legal obligation to meet with the Giants until he's a contracted employee. He can sign tender, but Giants will put him on non football injury list, which essentially negates the guaranteed money of the franchise tag.  This is so sad. Can't believe one of our leaders and defensive captain put himself and his team in this situation."
NYGiants,3ckpy0,Frosssty,2,Wed Jul 8 21:41:15 2015 UTC,"Guys, this doesn't automatically mean JPP didn't want to meet with the Giants. We don't know why they didn't meet."

NYGiants,3cnv5o,Markey_v,3,Thu Jul 9 10:41:56 2015 UTC,"C'mon, every one needs to calm the hell down and just wait for an actual report to come out.  ""Amputation"" on a medical chart could mean the tip of his finger, he could be absolutely fine, or he could have a nub and no feeling in his palm....who the hell knows.  Why not just wait a few weeks instead of this wild speculation every single day."

NYGiants,3cnv5o,3rdAnnual,3,Thu Jul 9 11:19:58 2015 UTC,"As far as staying on the team after this season, who knows?   There's a reason why the team wasn't willing to offer a long-term deal to Jason in line with what the market generally bears for DEs of his caliber.  I guarantee you that this was not the first evidence they've seen of his general dumbfuckery-- the other stuff just didn't make the papers.  I'd be shocked if they're willing to sign up for more of that at other-than-total-bargain prices."
NYGiants,3cnv5o,derpoftheirish,3,Thu Jul 9 12:19:26 2015 UTC,"in line with what the market generally bears for DEs of his caliber.    I don't think the deal was far off from what he deserved. Certainly he seems to have the talent to be a top paid DE, but in reality he's had 1 great season (2011), one very good season (2014), and three just ok seasons (though to be fair one was his rookie year with limited action). If he wants JJ Watt money he has to play to his enormous potential every single season."
NYGiants,3cnv5o,TheCowgirlCrusher,-1,Thu Jul 9 13:04:38 2015 UTC,I wonder how much of his potential he just squandered.
NYGiants,3cnv5o,derpoftheirish,2,Thu Jul 9 13:34:17 2015 UTC,"He doesn't have a year left on shit. He's a free agent who we have given the franchise tag (which he has not yet signed the tender for). We or any other team can negotiate a long term deal with him until July 15th. If nothing is signed by then (with us or another team who would have to give us 2 1st round picks in compensation), then he his options become only to play for the franchise deal or sit out the year. Also after July 15th we can no longer negotiate any new deal until after the season is over.  He's going to sign his tender and play this season, but right now he is a free agent."

NYGiants,3cl3vl,SapCPark,3,Wed Jul 8 19:22:38 2015 UTC,"For those unfamiliar, here is a scouting report.  Short version: He's a little under-sized (played around 280-290 lbs), but moves well. He'll need to bulk up and needs some more polishing before being NFL ready but he's definitely a decent prospect.  His big problem is off the field issues:  He was suspended in 2013 for striking an opponent during a game, and again by his team in 2014 for undisclosed reasons. He was also arrested over the summer for marijuana possession, and has a baby on the way. So there's a lot going on for him right now.  My guess? I think we pass, but maybe a 4th/5th round flier. That would almost assuredly get outbid."

NYGiants,3ch7co,Yes-I-Lift,2,Wed Jul 8 19:25:11 2015 UTC,I'm actually thinking this is starting to be a ploy to get the Giants to drop the tag so he can become a free agent.

Edit: if the updated cap space figures that I looked at are correct looks like there are a handful of teams with room for a 12+ mil per year contract. Still I doubt the Giants will pull back the tag and even if he wanted them to, I feel like teams would be hesitant to sign long term after this incident."

NYGiants,3ch7co,3rdAnnual,1 point,Wed Jul 8 00:04:08 2015 UTC,"My take:  JPP doesn't yet know what his recovery timetable will be.  This uncertainty means that he has no motivation to keep the team up-to-date.  Consider the possibilities:  Best case:  If he can be ready for week 1, it really doesn't matter much whether he communicates with the team or not.  He can wait to inform them when he shows up to sign his tender.  And, hey, if the team rescinds the Tender out of frustration in the interim, well, he gets to market his services all around the League, which is what he wanted from the beginning.  Middling case:  Ready sometime between week 1 and game 6:  Huge advantage to not sign the Tender.  If he signs, shows up, and gets put on the NFI list at the start of the regular season, he's out of games 1-6 (and likely out of game checks 1-6) no matter when he's ready to play.  By holding off on signing the Tender until he's healthy, he can return to play (and receiving checks) that week, rather than waiting unitl week 6.    Somewhat worse:  recovery sometime between game 6 and game 10.  Again, not signing the tender is advantageous here.  There would be some risk that the team moves him to full-season NFI list, if he were under contract, which would ""toll"" his contract.  (I.e., the year wouldn't count towards its expiration, and he'd be under contract for 2016 under the same terms.)  But, as an un-signed franchise player, he can return at any time prior to game 10 and still have the season ""count"" towards his free agency rights.  (Mike Wallace did this in his last year with the Steelers.)  Really bad:  recovery timeframe post-game-10.  Doesn't matter.  Whether he's an unsigned Franchise Player or a player on the NFI list, his contract tolls, allowing the team to apply the FT contract in 2016 if they want to.    DOOM: Career ending.  Letting the team evaluate him would just lead to them revoking the Tender.  His agent and creditors start calling to try to get back any money they've loaned him.  Unpleasant.  Best to put off until the last possible moment.  In no instance is letting the team evaluate him and signing the tender before he's completely healthy in JPP's best interest."

NYGiants,3cg87u,Lextreme21,1 point,Tue Jul 7 18:51:38 2015 UTC,"Fortunately, DE is our deepest position on defense. We have 3 DEs other than JPP that can start from day 1(Moore, Ayers, Selvie) and we also have Kennard who's greatest strength is his pass rushing. Add to that we have Diggy and Wynn, and I think we should still be pretty solid even if JPP misses 6 games."
NYGiants,3cg87u,3rdAnnual,3,Tue Jul 7 19:01:52 2015 UTC,"That's... optimistic.    Moore and Ayers both had serious struggles in run D last year, and Moore compounded his problems with consistent mental errors.

The Giants are an especially stingy team when it comes to change in the uniform.   What I'm getting at is if you find an OBJ jersey from last year it will be the same as this year because I'm 99% sure that we didn't make any changes, though I guess we did wear a patch last season and I don't think we'll have one this year. The only changes I remember over the passed 10 years or so is the aforementioned occasional patch on the left breast (as seen in the banner above) and I believe we did wear white pants on a few occasions. Oh and the red jerseys that were really bad and I don't think we ever won in them."
NYGiants,3cemrl,klitchell,2,Tue Jul 7 11:37:12 2015 UTC,"That's really helpful thanks a lot. Yeah, I was coming at it from a soccer point of view where they change every year.

NYGiants,3cemrl,klitchell,3,Tue Jul 7 13:17:44 2015 UTC,Reebok jerseys would be pre 2012 season.Nike took over the contract in 2012.

NYGiants,3cbln4,50_shades_of_winning,8,Mon Jul 6 23:12:48 2015 UTC,The article I read said he wasn't planning on signing the offer prior to accident. Maybe the injury is serious enough that the team is backing away
NYGiants,3cbln4,keystonehap3,10,Mon Jul 6 17:23:10 2015 UTC,"He was never likely to sign it-- he had already rejected it.  But the situation right now is that Pierre-Paul has more and better information about his condition and prognosis than the Giants do. If JPP suddenly changes his mind about this being a good move for him, it's a sign that his situation is worse than the team thinks it is.  Officially rescinding the offer protects the team from that possibility."
NYGiants,3cbln4,3rdAnnual,2,Mon Jul 6 18:12:38 2015 UTC,"Seems to me the team could void the offer even if he signed it.  This is like the definition of an off-the-field, non-football-related injury.  I don't really know what the Giants gain by rescinding other than embarrassing JPP (and maybe hypothetically avoiding doing some paperwork)."
NYGiants,3cbln4,VTFD,5,Mon Jul 6 18:49:00 2015 UTC,"It's always easier to prevent a payment than it is to claw it back after the fact.  For example, the Giants lost on appeal when they tried to rescind some of Plaxico's bonus money after his explosive incident."

He isn't really expected to be doing much more than swatting balls down, fine dexterity of the fingers doesn't really seem all that necessary to me as a DE.   Am I missing the boat here? This shows some poor judgement which in general the Org (and myself) frown upon deeply, but I am not seeing how this is going to have a major impact on his playing ability."

To that I say that (given Cruz being healthy) I'm betting OBJ's numbers fall off a bit. Not due to his skill, but due to the fact that he will likely be drawing extra coverage leaving Cruz a bunch of 1 v 1 match ups that he can dominate. And THAT I think is the real gift here. Cruz's really only great season was when he was on the field with Nicks and Manningham - both who drew more attention than Cruz allowing him the weak match ups. This will be a similar situation, and one I hope and expect Eli and co. to take advantage of."

I'm not trying to talk sh!t, but I'm a buy low and sell high kinda guy.  It's almost as though JPP has decreased production over the years, lowering his value.    Is he effective?  Yes.  But I'm not sure a franchise tag should be used on him."
NYGiants,3c952a,DudeFalcone,1 point,Mon Jul 6 13:29:59 2015 UTC,I agree I wasn't exactly thrilled about paying him the amt he wants to begin with. This depending how it goes down makes the decision much easier.
NYGiants,3c952a,cracked6,1 point,Mon Jul 6 14:25:52 2015 UTC,To be he's been playing through injuries the past 2(3?) seasons.  BUT this injury is pure stupidity.  I'm ready to move on.
NYGiants,3c952a,lolibet,1 point,Mon Jul 6 14:57:26 2015 UTC,"Yeah but that reason, in and of it self, is why I don't think he's worth the money.  IF he can stay healthy he could be a monster but he can't.  Even when playing through injury he isn't productive.  I know he graded out as a good end last year and was great against the run but do you pay a guy that much money to be good against the run?  These nagging injuries with the Giants are so frustrating and I fear the same will happen to ODB (praying it's not).  It just seems anytime we have an All-NFL talent they rise and fall within 3 years which is insane."

NYGiants,3c952a,caveman_chubs,0,Fri Jul 10 05:30:44 2015 UTC,"I dunno about the rest of you, but if possible I'd like to see the Giants revoke the Franchise tag. JPP has demonstrated this year that he is not about the team - and this is just one more injury an already historically injured team just doesn't need and certainly could have been avoided. Not to mention that a good portion of the hype about JPP came year ago when he came up big with that blocked kick. Is he a good player? Yup, sure, I'd even go so far to say above average. But, he is no LT, Strahan or Tuck (in his prime) - Big Blue is foolish to treat him the same."
NYGiants,3c952a,BigBlueWookiee,2,Mon Jul 6 12:24:53 2015 UTC,Chip would have traded him already.

NYGiants,3c952a,_newyorkgiants_,1 point,Mon Jul 6 13:26:35 2015 UTC,"Yup, he's been working hard for the last 3 seasons as well, but look at the production. The frank fact of the matter is that the VAST majority of his sacks (which is his main selling point) we gained the last 6 weeks of the season; when we had an easier schedule and most teams slacked on playing us, mostly because they could.   I just don't think he is anywhere near the player he wants us to pay him to be. I can accept injuries, and even respect playing through them. But at the end of the day, he is no JJ Watt - though that is what he expects to get paid when he has never (even his healthy years) performed at that level.   As a fan base, we really need to take a cold hard look at him, his production, work ethic and decision making skills. Is he a good fit for the Giants? Does he care about the team? Where is his focus? In a year with a new defensive coordinator, how will he (after missing so much preseason) work into the mix? How long will it take him to learn his role and achieve his potential, if at all? The answer to the majority of these questions is I don't know. And that speaks volumes right there."

NYGiants,3c85q3,TweetPoster,2,Sun Jul 5 20:19:58 2015 UTC,"For those wondering about his franchise tender/contract:   Pierre-Paul is currently a franchise player for the Giants, but does not have an active contract with the team.  He had been hoping to negotiate a long term extension with the Giants that would pay him in excess of $14 million per season. His one year tender offer was worth $14.8 million and now it could be worth nothing.  The Giants can opt to pull the tender offer from Pierre-Paul at any time which would, in turn, allow him to become an unrestricted free agent, at a time when he may be completely unable to play football. Even if he had signed the contract he would have no protection since the guarantee in the contract is for football injury only, meaning the Giants could place him on a non-Football injury list and avoid payment completely if they so desired."

Put Pugh and Flowers in at LT and LG, it would still be worrisome in terms of the LT situation, but at least we'd shore up the entire right half of the line with that move... I don't see any DE who can make us competitive. Might as well let our young guys all have a shot.  The problem with Mathis is he's so old.... and I don't see him competing for another 3 years. The contract would have to be a 2 year deal... or a 3 year deal with the third year completely un-guaranteed. I don't know if he'd go for that."
NYGiants,3c8fe1,Elided_Ego,1 point,Mon Jul 6 00:41:43 2015 UTC,"His age isn't a concern with me. Beatty is a solid LT, so the Giants need a bandaid more than they need a long term solution. Flowers likely is the long term option for LT, and RG shouldn't be that hard to fill.  There are no free agent  DEs worth it, which is why I would want the Giants to trade for one. But, that's only if JPP is actually significantly injured."
NYGiants,3c8fe1,50_shades_of_winning,1 point,Mon Jul 6 01:26:31 2015 UTC,"I'm curious as to whether this injury and the fact that he hasn't signed his tender yet will make JPP realize what he is putting on the line by not doing a contract extension this year. Hell probably only get 10-12 mil/year if he resigns this offseason and he wants 14mil range, but those extra 2 mil a year mean nothing if you don't get any long term contract. Maybe he will realize he needs that guaranteed money now and he will agree to a contract more in the range the Giants want."
NYGiants,3c8fe1,THATBUSFROMSPEED,1 point,Sun Jul 5 23:13:35 2015 UTC,"I'd rather keep JPP and spend the $15MM than sign any one of those guys. Early signs indicate it isn't career-ending, so I think we'll still allow him to sign the tender because if we don't he'll become an UFA and sign somewhere else"

See you on the field week 1 or in another uniform making 1/3rd what you would have made with a great organization in the Giants who have won 2 Super Bowls in ~10 years.  When you have the great Michael Strahan to live up to, and this is the  type of shit you pull (after 2 solid but at least a little disappointing seasons btw), I question how much you want to be on the Giants and play for a winning organization.

To be a serious 2015 contender, this team would need quite a lot of rather unlikely things to break their way.  I think they're making progress, but unless some unexpected players seriously overperform reasonable expectations, it'll be incremental progress, not sudden success.    (This is a large part of why I've long thought that tagging JPP wasn't the right move-- if 2015 is unlikely to be a success, it makes little sense to overpay a guy for just 1 more year.  If you need to rebuild and you don't think he's part of the long-term solution, then rebuild, and don't waste resources trying to make it look pretty in the interim.)  Edit:  Year corrected.  To be a 2014 contender, they would need all of the above, plus a time machine."

NYGiants,3c2l09,fudmuffin,1 point,Sat Jul 4 13:40:39 2015 UTC,"Avoiding NFC East Players is a fatal fantasy mistake.  Let me tell you why:   No disrespect but the NFCE cannot play defense.  NFCE matchups are always high scoring.  So lets say you draft Tony Romo or Odell Beckham Jr, you basically guaranteed 6 money matchups where they rip the score sheet apart. With the exception of this upcoming season, NFCE teams tend to play one another in the season's last few weeks and this is the fantasy football playoff schedule.  These teams tend to go all out and you even see guys like Mark Sanchez and DeSean Jackson suddenly blowing up.   Side note: I am a 49ers fan and I will tell you that repeatedly lose fantasy title games for this very reason.  Ive seen my fantasy team get destroyed by other guys who had mostly cowboys or eagles on their fantasy teams.  Stockpile NFCE players on your fantasy team and also stockpile AFC+NFC North RBs.  Weather gets very cold in December (during Fantasy playoffs) and these north teams resort to running the ball.  If you noticed that Leveon Bell, Jeremy Hill, Forte, Lacy, Forsett, and even Joique Bell all had a field day during that time last season."
NYGiants,3c2l09,Metfan722,1 point,Mon Jul 6 18:30:24 2015 UTC,"This was in a non-standard league. You had an extra position of everything (two QB's, two RB's, three WR's, two TE's, two flexes, two kickers, and two DEF's), where it was also one point PPR for both the QB and the WR with yard bonuses as well. So a QB goes over 300 yards he gets an extra 10 points, a RB or TE or WR goes over 120 yards, they get a 10 point bonus. All this with only 8 people. So that's why I can afford to skip out on other NFC East players.  So really if you get a couple of good QB's you're at the very least competitive."

NYGiants,3bwnfg,TheCowgirlCrusher,2,Thu Jul 2 20:53:34 2015 UTC,He played really well last year.
NYGiants,3bwnfg,dagaboy,2,Thu Jul 2 22:42:47 2015 UTC,Our Defense was noticeably different when he was in the games last year. He was one of our top defensive players.  Hitchens will most likely be starting at MLB now. He is good but not nearly as physically dominating as Rolando.

Weatherford is a professional athlete and expected to act like a professional .. not get butthurt from some comments by an eagles fan on twitter and reduce himself to insulting someones wife.  People justifying it by saying ""the guy was harrassing him for days on end"" or some shit, who cares? isn't that part of the business? everyone with a big following base on twitter has these people, doesn't excuse him for his actions.  I doubt anything will come from this because he removed it quickly and across the board of the NFL he's a low-profile player but could you imagine the shit storm that would happen if Tom Brady or Peyton Manning tweeted this?"

NYGiants,3bvtir,DriverPatel,4,Fri Jul 3 02:14:04 2015 UTC,"Steve Weatherford not only represents himself but a brand. He represents the New York Giants. Calling some dude's wife ugly is childish and is scooping down to the level the guy he was responding too.   It doesn't make Weatherford right at all. However, it does is make him look like an idiot and tarnishes his and the Giants brand. He takes up $3 million in cap space and the 9th most cap space on the Giants. Do you see punters make that much money ever? He's expandable and can be cut at any time. He has everything to lose."

No. This is the problem with social media, if you want to call someone a bitch multiple times a day from the comfort of your phone where he can't touch you then you should prepare for shit to come flying back. I don't blame Steve at all. The fact of the matter is everyone can dish shit out but if you can't take it when it comes back then you shouldn't be talking in the first place."
NYGiants,3bvtir,KidSniffer,18,Thu Jul 2 16:47:22 2015 UTC,Weatherford is the guy with everything to lose.  He should just stop.

Making a crude insult about a man's wife is a low blow, all he could have done is taken a picture of his ring, or taken the high road and not engage.   If he's serious about his career in broadcasting he needs to be a little more responsible and he obviously realized due to how fast he deleted this tweet."
NYGiants,3bvtir,KidSniffer,-5,Thu Jul 2 17:02:11 2015 UTC,"And calling him a bitch multiple times isn't any less crude?  I'm sorry, but I'm of the opinion that if you can't take shit, don't talk shit."

Absolutely bring as much alcohol and food. Bring a few bottles and no one will turn you away from food. In fact most legit taiglate people are so proud of their homemade recipes or grilling prowess they will FORCE you to try their food.   Parking pass is crucial if you want to drive in your own car.   I typically leave my parking spot 15 minutes before game time. But if you want to watch warm-ups, then go in 90 minutes before kickoff.  Not sure about the DSLR, that may be a problem and last thing you don't want to run back to your car when already at the gate.  Quick Tip: No bookbags, camera bags, or anything other than a purse is allowed. Everything must be in CLEAR Plastic bags.   HAVE FUN"

NYGiants,3buo83,combatjohnny,2,Thu Jul 2 13:18:41 2015 UTC,"Oh you wanted real advice. You can drink on the trains if you really want to. Bring a brown paper bag but I've seen ppl give no fucks and drink it in the open. No one cares. Bring as much drank as you like. If they offer you something to eat you don't have to give them cash. You could offer them a beer tho.  Better off asking someone else as I usually stick to my crew when tailgating.  It's very laid back. Ppl only get pissed of an oposing fan starts talking shit but usually banter is all just teasing in good fun. Giants have really classy fans in my opinion    And as for showing up, if tailgating I'd say maybe 2-3 hours before game.  3-4 if you want to see warm ups. Never really taken the train in but my experience with nj transit is that the depart and arrive tines are pretty spot on"

NYGiants,3buo83,combatjohnny,2,Thu Jul 2 14:58:00 2015 UTC,"One note about the train is you have to take the Meadowlands shuttle from Secaucus,which means coming from most places you have to transfer at Secaucus. If you have an open beer when you transfer they'll make you throw it away, so don't open a fresh one right before you get to the transfer station."

NYGiants,3buo83,I_Eat_Your_Pets,1 point,Thu Jul 2 13:54:17 2015 UTC,"So if you're not driving, then take the train, you will have to transfer at Secaucus. Be aware, if you have open alcohol they will likely make you throw it out, so make sure everything is closed until you get on the train from Secaucus to the Meadowlands.  I would say walk around, certainly offer some beer in exchange for food, however there should be plenty of people who are willing to open their tailgate to you without askng for anything in return.  If it's a 1pm game, I would get there by 10:30am or so, so you have enough time to feel the crowd in the parking lots and then enter the game around 12:45 or so. You can watch warm-ups if you want, but frankly I don't find them too exciting.  Also you can't bring anything into the game...literally everything has to be in a clear bag, no cameras, backpacks, nothihg...that's pretty annoying.   You will be walking a lot in the parking lot so find a good way to carry your beer and wear comfortable shoes (And especially clothes if it's cold...the Meadowlands seems to have a permanent wind in the area).  I would also try to make yourself somehow identifiable, if people know it's your first game and tailgate they will be much more open. Giants fans in general, however, are very open and friendly so you won't have a tough time."

So be extroverted, jovial, and a little bit extra loud, and that will work wonders for you."

NYGiants,3bvr9a,HowYaGuysDoin,6,Thu Jul 2 15:34:48 2015 UTC,"1) I decided this season to do something interesting-- buy the #1st round jersey and only wear that jersey until he is traded, released, or retires.  Then, my replacement jersey has to be whoever is drafted in the first that year.  This way, i have an emotional connection to a rookie going into his first season.  Is it a smart use of money?  Not at all.  But i don't smoke, don't gamble... my vices are pretty minimal, so this could be an exciting way to rep my squad.    Best case it's a jersey every few years; Worst case, it's a jersey a season.  People buy a lot more, so i'm probably still ahead of the game!  2)  I'm really into the idea supporting rookies.  He's not going to have a shitload of jerseys sold, so it would be cool to support the new guy-- especially given that I think he's going to be with us for awhile.    3)  There's always duct tape."
NYGiants,3bvr9a,_newyorkgiants_,4,Thu Jul 2 15:38:37 2015 UTC,I learned from my buddy a few years ago with David WIlson. He bought Wilsons jersey from camp and preseason which was 34. When the season started he changed it to 22. My buddy was stuck with a very expensive jersey of a non-existant Wilson #34...  Obviously all the tragedy of his injuries aside...that still sucks
NYGiants,3bsyqu,pumadude321,42,Wed Jul 1 22:05:15 2015 UTC,I really want to beat them twice
NYGiants,3bsyqu,_ShutThatBabyUp,15,Wed Jul 1 23:53:33 2015 UTC,Amen.
NYGiants,3bsyqu,pinkshortsarecool,14,Thu Jul 2 01:49:48 2015 UTC,"I completely agree. I think they will regress. I also think their o-line is overrated, people think they're a moving brick wall. The line is fantastic, but not magical.   I think they will regress for the same reasons you brought up and I honestly think Romo may even get injured. But to be fair Dez has been fantastic and I wouldn't be surprised if he had a career year or close to it."
NYGiants,3bsyqu,3rdAnnual,5,Wed Jul 1 22:20:42 2015 UTC,"No doubt Dez has been fantastic, and definitely agree with you!"
NYGiants,3bsyqu,pinata_penis_pump2,4,Thu Jul 2 01:56:12 2015 UTC,"Nah, they'd have gotten very good run protection from backups even if DeMarco had gotten hurt again.  With a very good QB, a very good OL, and 2+ passing-game threats that scare defenses, the RB is a secondary factor.  With good health at all those other positions, they were a near-lock to be an incredibly prolific offense.  And they still are, assuming that age doesn't catch up to Witten and/or Romo.  The reason Dallas surged last year was that their defense exceeded expectations.  Look at any of the commentary that was out there this time last year-- the most common take was that they had taken what was one of the worst defenses in NFL history, and somehow made it even worse.  Turning that into an average-ish unit through good coaching and player development is what got them from 8 or 9 wins up to 12."
NYGiants,3bsyqu,idgaf_neverreallydid,12,Wed Jul 1 23:38:53 2015 UTC,"They're delusional if they think they're not going to see some sort of regression.  I think they're truly undervaluing how much Murray played in their success.  Just look at the Thanksgiving game.  You guys completely stuffed Murray and that put lots of pressure on Romo, and we all know how that game ended up.  Also, while their offensive line was good for the run, they were still league average in sacks allowed.  Their defense did not improve, contrary to what they think.  They have a rookie CB from UConn that they expect to start, and let's be real here, ""athleticism"" doesn't equate immediate impact.  Sean Lee is coming off an ACL injury, and their D-line isn't spectacular.  They all hype up Demarcus Lawrence, but just because he has the same name as Demarcus Ware doesn't make him All-Pro."
NYGiants,3bsyqu,GragasBodySlam,4,Wed Jul 1 22:59:26 2015 UTC,Our former running back got stuffed other games and our offense had no problem. Namely against the Eagles and Colts. Our offense was great both of those games without him playing well.
NYGiants,3bsyqu,idgaf_neverreallydid,3,Thu Jul 2 01:22:27 2015 UTC,"Great?  In the Dallas-Eagles Thanksgiving game, which is the game I think you're referring to when DeMarco didn't do well, Dez had 4 receptions for 73 yards with no TDs.  Is that great in your eyes?"
NYGiants,3bsyqu,idgaf_neverreallydid,0,Thu Jul 2 01:54:07 2015 UTC,A game on short rest flying back from new york playing vs the most conditioned team in the NFL. Calm down
NYGiants,3bsyqu,TheCowgirlCrusher,-2,Thu Jul 2 02:12:58 2015 UTC,OK no offense but which game did our offense go off against yall? On Thanksgiving or Sunday night football? We played two games not one.
NYGiants,3bsyqu,leandroc76,2,Thu Jul 2 01:59:55 2015 UTC,"Well you referenced when DeMarco got stuffed which was really only the Thanksgiving.  He didn't have a great game on Sunday Night Football, but he still had 2 TDs.  If we are talking about all offense, Dez went off on Sunday Night, with 6 receptions, 114 yards, and 3 TDs.  He didn't do nearly as well on Thanksgiving."
NYGiants,3bsyqu,tercra,2,Thu Jul 2 03:05:09 2015 UTC,He had two touchdowns from the goal line. He averaged like two yards a carry.

NYGiants,3bsyqu,CarlosFromPhilly,0,Thu Jul 2 03:37:43 2015 UTC,"It's about 2 yards, but over the course of that game the difference between 2ypc and the yardage he had is about 23.5% of his running total.  Pretty large difference.  With that being said, I was clearly being a dick to him because he's a cowboys fan. So.........."
NYGiants,3bsyqu,TheCowgirlCrusher,2,Thu Jul 2 03:42:34 2015 UTC,"It won't be the lack of talent at RB, it will be lack of talent at Head Coach. A better coach would have won a SB or two already with Romo, Witten and that offensive line alone."
NYGiants,3bsyqu,SameShit2piles,1 point,Thu Jul 2 02:46:59 2015 UTC,Very true.  Their defense has been horrible as well.
NYGiants,3bsyqu,derpoftheirish,2,Thu Jul 2 11:32:33 2015 UTC,"On paper they are probably the best team in the division, however I think DAL/PHL/NYG are all pretty close and any of those three could win the division handily.  WSH is a bit further back but not as much as people think.  Its gonna be another crapshoot year.  I do not think the Cowboys are going to enjoy the kind of success they did last year, the loss of Murray will be felt and teams are going to focus on taking Dez completely out of the game.  He's a beast of a player but has a tendency to kind of disappear for stretches of games/the season, without him and without Murray they lack a real threat offensively.  I also don't see their defense as anything above average.  That being said, they are still a good team and the preseason favorite to take the division for sure."
NYGiants,3bsyqu,Tuckason,2,Thu Jul 2 16:17:12 2015 UTC,Tony Romo is basically a glass cannon one more heavy shot to that back and hes out
NYGiants,3bsyqu,dagaboy,3,Thu Jul 2 18:06:07 2015 UTC,"They lost one of their top two offensive weapons, but they still have one of the top (if not the) best pass protecting offensive lines in the NFL, a QB who is finally capable of recovering  from his back ailments and easily one of the best WR in the game. That said, they are going to be missing one of their newly acquired defensive presences for a few games off the bat, and have question marks at the RB position.    I don't know 100% what to think about what the F went on with DeMarco Murray last year, but i do not think that another back will be able to run the ball and catch passes as consistently as him for as many games as him.  It's just not going to happen.  Murray's 2014 season is an outlier.    How that will impact their passing game, i have no idea.  But i don't believe they are going to have the season this year that they did last year.    I would like to  think it's more likely that they will continue to have the trouble at home, throw a lot more short pass incompletions without Murray's 92% receiving rate which will lead to more pressures which will lead to more hurries which will lead to more incompletions which will lead to 8-8."
NYGiants,3bsyqu,SameShit2piles,4,Thu Jul 2 00:36:08 2015 UTC,I think their running back was the least important piece of their offense by far. They can get plenty of production with RBBC
NYGiants,3bsyqu,dagaboy,1 point,Thu Jul 2 03:33:04 2015 UTC,"To me the bottom line is Romo.  IMO he is the toughest QB in the league.  If he can get out there, he will be.  One huge plus is the offensive line dictating games.  If they continue, Romo will be upright and get the job done.  That being said I could easily see him missing some games this season.  We really need to enjoy our matchups.  Our games are always ridiculous and you never know who is going to win it.  We will look back at these games when we suck again."

NYGiants,3bsyqu,DudeFalcone,1 point,Thu Jul 2 02:33:09 2015 UTC,"There's no doubt that the Oline is great, but the RB talent is significantly different. According to PFF Murray had the second most yards after contact last year, so a lot of the running success was from him alone. I would not be surprised if they don't have any RBs hit 1000 yards, which will seriously change their game plan. Romo had a great season last year, due, at least in part, to the success of the run game. I think that Romo can lead a team, but they will be forced to resort to the game plans from all the 8-8 years. Can Romo's back hold up? The defense got a lot of attention becasue they outperformed the predictions, but that meant average when they were expected to be horrid. I give them credit for that, but that defense does not scare me. I expect them to improve a little this year, but they also benefitted from the success from the run game. I don't see how they can expect to get 12 or more wins this year. I think 10 wins is the ceiling and 7 is the basement."

Odell is just technically near-perfect and is great at fooling CBs and getting them to bite on false reads. Plax didn't have to be perfect because of his size - Odell does.  I could definitely be wrong, though."

NYGiants,3bxpeg,XxSexyLatinaMaidxX,3,Fri Jul 3 03:43:04 2015 UTC,I don't think so. I think that modern receivers coming into the game are different altogether. Odell is simply remarkably talented as Plaxico just had the right height and QB. Plaxico was never that special to me.

NYGiants,3bxpeg,cellcell,1 point,Sun Jul 5 21:38:41 2015 UTC,"The term that best describes OBJ is ""Grace Under Pressure"".  The coverages he makes those circus catches in are pretty damn good.  Which is one reason why they look so damn impossible sometimes.  Plax was taller, ran more jump ball routes and was, in my humble opinion, not quite as mentally acute as OBJ.  You can practice routes, drill position, develop schemes and prepare as best as you can.  But you cannot teach grace or intelligence.  And if by some miracle OBJ is reading this...DON'T BUY A FUCKING GUN!!!!"
NYGiants,3btrrr,RickSmith123,4,Thu Jul 2 02:12:04 2015 UTC,"I think we should temper our expectations... He had a good rookie season, but he's below average athletically and that can hurt someone so young. What he lacks in athleticism he makes up for in versatility though. He's a very good pass rusher from the LB position, and I think that's where he will have the biggest impact. If he can improve his pass coverage, and become a good run stopper, he can be a pretty good player for us for years. I don't see him ever leading the team in tackle, but maybe I'm wrong. His max potential is a Jamie Collins player, which is great and better than Id expect. Personally, I expect anywhere from 80-100 tackles, maybe an int or two, and 6-8 sacks. That's better than anything we've had at linebacker in a long time."
NYGiants,3btrrr,OBJesus,4,Thu Jul 2 03:57:48 2015 UTC,"I would love to agree with you about the athleticism of Kennard but I can't, the kids only gotten bigger and faster. He is a natural DE and played that all the way up until his SC days where they had them at that hybrid OLB/DE so he's got natural pass rushing skills, but is still quick in the flats. His football smarts alone should put him notches above other guys. In good health, DK could be one of the best LBs we've drafted in the last 25 years."

NYGiants,3bu7tj,out_of_time,7,Thu Jul 2 04:48:11 2015 UTC,"Donnell and Fells both make roster 100%. Giants love veteran guys that can produce, and Fells fits that perfect. I would say it's about 40% for both Robinson or Lacrosse to make the final roster spot, and about 10% for Tye."
NYGiants,3bu7tj,OBJesus,3,Thu Jul 2 07:27:01 2015 UTC,Robinson is not a better TE than Fells.
NYGiants,3bu7tj,SevenwithaT,2,Thu Jul 2 15:13:48 2015 UTC,"Robinson is bigger, faster, more agile, and younger.  Fells' advantages are all between the ears.  Which isn't to be discounted, but there's room for some optimism that Robinson can catch up in that department with his second year in this offensive system."
NYGiants,3bu7tj,3rdAnnual,1 point,Thu Jul 2 18:40:57 2015 UTC,Robinson had a very good spring too.
NYGiants,3bu7tj,dagaboy,2,Thu Jul 2 19:39:28 2015 UTC,Cunningham has been the one taking first team snaps while Donnell is sidelined with achilles tendonitis. so if i had to bet unless he sucks in the preseason he will make the team
NYGiants,3bu7tj,nyg1,2,Thu Jul 2 15:17:13 2015 UTC,"I would say Donnell is 100% and Fells is right behind him at 95%. Fells is the only complete TE on the roster that we can have even a modicum of confidence in as both a blocker and a pass catccher. Plus all of his catches last year were on very important plays (like 80% were TDs or 1st downs or something like that).  Donnell is the guy with the highest ceiling, or if not that, then at least the highest likelihood of reaching his ceiling this year.   Assuming those two make the roster and we keep 3 TEs, then the remaining 100% of likelihood is, in my mind, distributed thusly.   45% Cunningham 35% Robinson 15% Lacrosse 5% Tye   From what I've read this offseason it sounds like Cunningham has been the most impressive of those last 4 guys and he's been taking the most 1st team reps (though he still seems to get overlooked all the time).  He's younger than Robinson, and it seems like he has more upside as a pass catcher than Robinson does, which is why I give him the edge. They may decide they want to keep Robinson solely because of his blocking abilities though and that they are happy with Donnell being the pass catcher and Fells being the well rounded low ceiling veteran and Robinson being the primary blocker. I think that's a pretty short sighted view though and Cunningham is the guy with the best future outlook.   Between Tye and Lacosse I give Lacosse the edge soley based on what I've read which has been more complimentary of him. I think I saw some coaching assistant quoted as saying Lacosse never makes mental errors and that Tye has struggled with that a bit. The is also on the small side 6'2"" (?) For a pass catching TE and I think that hurts him. I think both Tye and Lacosse end up on PS if they clear waivers (which they should)"
NYGiants,3bu7tj,THATBUSFROMSPEED,2,Thu Jul 2 17:33:46 2015 UTC,"Donnell is 100%.  He's the starter, unless Robinson really starts to set the world on fire.  Robinson is probably 90%+.  He gets 1 more year to make good on the potential that made him a high draft pick.  Fells, it'd put at around 40%.  He puts a floor under the #2 TE spot, but his age and lack of developmental potential mean that the team won't hesitate to drop him if Robinson gets reliable enough in his assignments to be trusted as the #2 guy and one or more of the young folks shows enough potential to make the team worry about getting him through waivers to the PS.  If he makes the team, it's a bad sign about the young guys.  Cunningham 30%.  The time he's already spent with the team means that he's the most likely of the other 3 guys to make the active roster, IMO.  They'll be more confident in things like his ability to contribute on Special Teams than they will with the rookies.    LaCosse & Tye, 20% each.  If everyone stays healthy, the PS is a more likely destination here."
NYGiants,3bu7tj,3rdAnnual,1 point,Thu Jul 2 18:34:56 2015 UTC,"Fells does not in my opinion have a 5% chance to make this roster. He's not only the most well-rounded TE we have, but also the only veteran on the team. I give him a 75% chance because I honestly don't see them opting for 3 young guys unless all of those guys really impress or if Fells gets injured"

We have season tickets and things come up the day of the game, someone gets sick, kid has a game, etc. and there's a ticket floating around that it's better to get something than nothing for.  We've sold tickets for $20 (face $120) just to get rid of it.  Worst case scenario, you spend a day tailgating, but highly likely scenario is you can score a ticket for well below TM prices."

NYGiants,3bsru6,Coldhandles,4,Wed Jul 1 22:27:21 2015 UTC,"The Giants' primary MO is to go for excellent athletes who have strong work ethics, with college performance as a secondary factor.  It's not universal, and you'd love to have the full package, but all else being equal, they'll use their premium picks on hard-working, high-ceiling guys instead of guys who were big NCAA producers.  They trust their coaching to build the skills necessary, if the player is sufficiently devoted to his craft.  So an underclassman who hasn't yet achieved his full potential is going to be a bit more attractive to them than he is to some other teams."
NYGiants,3bsru6,3rdAnnual,1 point,Wed Jul 1 23:48:22 2015 UTC,Our team was one of the oldest in the league around 2011 and after.  The fallout of injuries and declining performance since then has definitely pushed the Giants to draft younger.

I'm also from the UK.  Gameday - Take the bus from Port Authority, along with all the other fans that turn up. Good atmosphere and somehow the bus service is rather organised (or at least compared to buses here in England). A quick search will give you the details of what the service is - I think its the 351 Express. Don't quote me I have not been for about a year.  NJ Rail service can get you there too, but I have never actually used it.

Football is a competitive industry, where you need to keep advancing your techniques or you'll get left behind.  I'm not a doctor or a trainer, but there is a lot being learned about preventing injuries.  There are guys like the Stanford strength coach, Shannon Turley, who are moving away from pure strength building to focus on injury prevention, mobility, balance and stamina.  Think about why people get injured on the football field.   It's often that a player puts themselves in a compromised physical position due to lack of flexibilty, mobility or stamina.  This is a really interesting article on the Stanford strength coach's philosophy.

They then went into periods of recovery stretching to prevent the soft tissue injuries that occurred during the 2013 season. In 2014, there were bone breaks, tendon tears, muscle tears, and a different type of injury profile. The monitoring devices are also gathering player information to help the team medical and training staff better condition the players and prevent injuries.

Al - I mean, does it base (?) with his thumb and his fourth finger... Heh that's ridiculous. Collinsworth - Tom Coughlin said that young man has given all of his (?)."

NYGiants,3bia9z,The_GOAT_,14,Mon Jun 29 13:22:18 2015 UTC,Drafting good LBs has been so foreign to this team for a while. Thank the Lord for Kennard.
NYGiants,3bia9z,SevenwithaT,5,Mon Jun 29 13:46:18 2015 UTC,"We had a good season last year with our rookies. Kennard,Williams, and we can't forget OBJ"
NYGiants,3bia9z,_newyorkgiants_,5,Mon Jun 29 14:08:13 2015 UTC,"Berhe was also named one of the best on special teams in the league by PFF, we got a lot of production from that draft class."
NYGiants,3bia9z,nyg1,2,Mon Jun 29 14:32:34 2015 UTC,"If Bromley shows some improvement it could go down as our best draft of all time. Odell, Richburgh, Bromley, Williams, Kennard and Behre."
NYGiants,3bia9z,Capt91,2,Mon Jun 29 14:14:30 2015 UTC,Hard not to improve over barely seeing the field.  Just hope I don't have to see Kuhn in that role getting blown up over and over.
NYGiants,3bia9z,pierovera,3,Mon Jun 29 18:59:58 2015 UTC,"As in every B/R article, there are some weird inconsistencies. For example:   McClellin had just two missed tackles while accumulating 40 total tackles over 12 games in 2014. He makes some sloppy arm-tackle attempts when he is on the move in space but was nonetheless one of the NFL’s most efficient tacklers last season.   VS   Shembo recorded 50 total tackles and only had two missed tackles in his rookie campaign. Able to keep himself around the ball consistently between the hashes, Shembo is a sound wrap-up tackler who is consistent with his form.   You would think the 2nd one would have the better grade, as he had a better percentage of made tackles compared to the 1st one, and he has no criticism over his form. Well, guess again. First one gets a perfect grade (35/35) while the 2nd one gets 34/35. It makes absolutely no sense.  IDK, just noticed it.  EDIT: Also, this one:   Even in the prime of his career, Lance Briggs (6’1”, 244 lbs, 12 seasons) has never been known to be much of a pass-rusher. He can occasionally blitz through a gap to bring pressure, but that ability has diminished to some extent as his explosiveness has decreased with age. He only had two total pressures in 2014.   VS   Although he was primarily used as an edge-rusher during his collegiate years at Notre Dame, Prince Shembo (6’0”, 254 lbs, one season) only played sparingly in that capacity with the Atlanta Falcons as a rookie. He has enough athleticism to create pressure around the outside and recorded five total pressures in 2014. If he had more length, he might have been used as an edge defender with more regularity.   Supposedly, B/R is rating the LBs by their performance in 2014 only, so it comes as a surprise when both of these players get the same grade (14/20), while one has clearly declined and did not perform as well this year, as well as having less than half the production as the other one."
NYGiants,3bia9z,SapCPark,2,Mon Jun 29 14:13:05 2015 UTC,I take all of the grading of Bleacher Report with a major grain of salt but their actual analysis of the player is pretty decent.

NYGiants,3bia9z,Capt91,2,Mon Jun 29 22:32:37 2015 UTC,Ayers was highly ranked by PFF but didn't qualify because he was sub 400 snaps or something like that.

We already started seeing it at the end of last year.  I don't want this guy to miss 4 games because someone takes a cheap shot at his head on a throw over the middle.  I know he's still young, I just hope he matures into a classy player that the Giants are known for instead of a Desean Jackson type.  The first time he has a critical 30 yard catch called back with a taunting penalty a lot of people are going to turn on him."
NYGiants,3b4tqy,TheFotty,4,Fri Jun 26 11:32:21 2015 UTC,"I would be interested to know where you saw showboating in that video? He has his little TD dance, and there were 2 shots of him reversing into the end zone when he had 20 yards between him and the secondary. Is Cruz showboating when he does his salsa? Last season it always seemed to me he played with a sense of urgency when on the field. I never felt like he was acting immature. I will grant that being a rookie and being considered one of the best receivers in the league is a lot for a young guy to handle, and it will create some pressure this season to have another solid performance this year, but I don't think this guy is taunting anyone. Certainly not in the video posted above."
NYGiants,3b4tqy,ZeroAccess,1 point,Fri Jun 26 14:13:21 2015 UTC,"When he made the catch over Burley at 2:55 for one,, the running backwards into the end-zone....it's all unnecessary.  It's not all necessarily illegal, but it's dumb and makes him look bad.  You don't want to be on Jackson's level.    I'm not talking about dancing in the end-zone, you can do that all day.    I'm not saying the guy is a clown at all, but there were definitely a lot of instances last year where he did some questionable, unnecessary shit that he needs to stop quickly."
NYGiants,3b4tqy,TheFotty,-1,Fri Jun 26 14:23:54 2015 UTC,"He would never get a flag drawn over 2:55. He just gave a shoulder pump ""yeah I caught it, what's up?"". You will see something like that in almost any game from any team. The guy might need to mature a little, but aren't all rookies supposed to mature in the league?"
NYGiants,3b4tqy,ZeroAccess,2,Fri Jun 26 14:34:56 2015 UTC,"I think he absolutely would get a flag over 2:55.  Standing over a downed player alone is enough to draw a flag now, but the shoulder pump would just seal it.    All rookies are supposed to mature, which is what I hope he does."
NYGiants,3b4tqy,TheFotty,2,Fri Jun 26 14:48:16 2015 UTC,I think he absolutely would get a flag over 2:55   Did he?
NYGiants,3b4tqy,ZeroAccess,1 point,Fri Jun 26 14:51:19 2015 UTC,"No idea.  I don't mean 100% of the time.  Are you saying he wouldn't 100% of the time?   If he doesn't change his attitude, when he gets a flag this year we can revisit this conversation."
NYGiants,3b4tqy,TheFotty,0,Fri Jun 26 14:57:29 2015 UTC,"I've seen flags thrown for nothing, and flags not thrown for blatant penalties, so nothing is 100%. I just don't think what he did there was showboating. For all we know Burley was talking shit to him. ""You won't catch one over me rookie!"". It is certainly what I would call a minor celebration, but I believe the flag they throw is for excessive celebration. Spinning the ball, running around like an idiot. I just don't see something flag worthy here."
NYGiants,3b4tqy,ZeroAccess,1 point,Fri Jun 26 15:07:20 2015 UTC,"Talking shit is always going to happen though, I just want to see Beckham mature past responding.  You don't want them to get in your head.  If they stop you from making the play, or if you taunt them and get flagged after making the play, then they've won no matter how it ends up.  A mature player wouldn't let them inside.    And knowing how wishy-washy the NFL is with their flags sometimes it doesn't make sense to give them ammo.   Note 3: Violations of (b) will be penalized if any of the acts are committed directly at an opponent. These acts  include but are not limited to: sack dances; home run swing; incredible hulk; spiking the ball; spinning the  ball; throwing or shoving the ball; pointing; pointing the ball; verbal taunting; military salute; standing over  an opponent (prolonged and with provocation); or dancing.    I've definitely seen it called before, and they are on a mission to crack down on it the last 2 seasons."
NYGiants,3b4tqy,jkess04,2,Fri Jun 26 15:10:51 2015 UTC,"I do believe towards the end of the season, after two consecutive games that he had personal fouls, he began to notably stop with anything, but you could always see him catching himself. he made it a point to keep handing the ball to the refs, which I guess keeps him from doing anything else he shouldnt do with it.   hes gonna have his moments, but hopefully he really does learn from it all, as it appeared he started to"
NYGiants,3b4tqy,jkess04,1 point,Sun Jun 28 19:59:25 2015 UTC,"hes not that bad, but he does spin the ball after most of his catches, and is going to become  major target just because of how foolish he makes people look, that he doesnt need to add any fuel to that fire"

NYGiants,3avg8d,ablebodiedmango,1 point,Wed Jun 24 11:18:48 2015 UTC,He said Pugh is hands down best active lineman right now. However flowers is a monster and it was a great pick and he should be great for us in the future just based off his size and athletic ability. Didn't ask about schwartz but I don't think he's practicing at the moment. We didn't talk about Newhouse either. But since he didn't bring him up I guess he's nothing to write home about.
NYGiants,3avg8d,dagaboy,1 point,Wed Jun 24 14:35:43 2015 UTC,Did you ask about their strength and conditioning and whether he feels their workout technique is weird or awkward?  Whether they seem to work too hard during practices?   Whether the coaches and management seem to pressure them to play through injuries?
NYGiants,3avg8d,kissmeimcumming,1 point,Wed Jun 24 01:34:24 2015 UTC,Nah wasn't really thinking about that when I was talking to him. Mainly asked about tackles and tight ends since that was where I thought he'd of gotten the most exposure and would have the most knowledge about everything.

NYGiants,3au16b,nyg1,11,Tue Jun 23 14:36:48 2015 UTC,"It's crazy how people doubt whether Kennard will be a starter this year, among our own fanbase. I have no doubt in my mind he'll lock the SAM position down. He's decent in coverage, good against the run and phenomenal rushing the passer. He's instinctual and a student of the game, is he the best athlete? No. But he makes up for it. If you asked me to name one player I expect to continue to make strides throughout his career, I'd pick Kennard"
NYGiants,3au16b,Sexterminator,7,Tue Jun 23 17:21:28 2015 UTC,He's Jessie Armstead 2.0 and I love it.  I wanted to be Armstead/Strahan when I was a kid.
NYGiants,3au16b,SapCPark,1 point,Tue Jun 23 20:06:53 2015 UTC,"Honestly I think the ""phenomenal"" rushing the passer is why some of us worry. Is he a good pass rusher? He was in college, so he may very well be. But last year his sacks were when he went uncovered or had Denard Robinson (I love DR, but he was a QB... he can't block) trying to block him. I'm not totally sold on him as a stud LB yet, but I think he's going to be our clear 2nd best LB if Beason's healthy"
NYGiants,3au16b,KingDusty,3,Wed Jun 24 02:22:50 2015 UTC,He also had good production against TEs in run stopping. If he develops his game in coverage we could have a our future at one of the OLB positions
NYGiants,3au16b,KingDusty,2,Wed Jun 24 03:16:56 2015 UTC,"Yeah he's a good all around LB I think, I just don't think based on last year we can say he's a great NFL pass rusher. He certainly took advantage of his opportunities but I'd like to see what he does when teams don't forget about him"

NYGiants,3ar1ge,Boxasauras,7,Mon Jun 22 20:31:41 2015 UTC,"I can do position groups, I'll update this comment when I've finished Position Group Strengths:  WR: Perhaps the most talent-rich position on the team and surely the deepest, the Giants have to be feeling comfortable with their WR Corps heading into 2015. If Odell Beckham Jr can do as well in 16 games as he did last year in 12, he will find himself in the top 10 in receiving yards yet again. Beckham not only possesses speed and agility, but a route running prowess and ability to catch damn near anything that is almost unparalleled. There is much reason to be hopeful for the young budding star, but also reason to think his production might take a slight step backwards. That reason? Victor Cruz. You gotta think that with Cruz coming off of a serious injury that teams will be double/triple covering OBJ and hoping that Cruz, Rueben Randle and company can't beat one-on-ones. There is reason to temper expectations for Cruz, but at the same time he has been way ahead of schedule in terms of his rehab. If he comes back as 90% of the player he was that is still a very solid slot option who will help stress opposing defenses. Rueben Randle, meanwhile, is one of the better WR3's in the league. He has had some issues in the past (route running, being benched due to missing meetings), but really came on at the end of last year to put together two outstanding games to finish the season. If he can keep that production up, watch out. Beyond the big 3, the Giants are anything but devoid at depth at WR. Cory Washington is our resident Preseason Superstar who just needs more contribution on Special Teams to get out of Tom Coughlin's doghouse; Dwayne Harris will take another roster spot although he will be a huge factor on Special Teams. Then you've got veteran Preston Parker, fellow Preseason star Marcus Harris and 6th round rookie Geremy Davis vying for the final roster spot. This team has 8 players that could be on an NFL roster, and will likely only be keeping 6.   DE: The Giants lost their identity a bit in 2012-2013, failing to maintain their status as a DE factory with a declining Tuck and oft-injured JPP. 2014, however, was totally different. JPP was healthy and had a huge resurgence, showing up as a dominant force against both run and pass. FA acquisition Robert Ayers was a very pleasant surprise, notching 5 sacks over 13 healthy games. While he wasn't an asset against the run, Ayers actually was more impactful against the pass than his sack numbers indicate. Ayers actually scored higher than JPP per his PFF grade, receiving an incredibly high +18.8 in Pass Rushing grade. Behind Ayers, young up-and-comers Owamagbe Odighizuwa and Damontre Moore should see significant playting time. Owa looks to be a signature 4-3 run-stuffing DE prototype, who needs work in pass pro but will surely help to bring the Giants' run D out of the gutter. Moore is something of an enigma: at times he can be a phenom, blocking punts on STs and making plays with sheer athleticism. Other times, though, he leaves fans scratching their head. Still, there is much hope for the developing end, especially in a Steve Spagnuolo defense that loves to get after the QB. George Selvie and 2nd-year player Kerry Wynn round out the depth chart as solid-but-unspectacular depth pieces.  QB: After what can only be described as an abysmal year in 2013, facing mounting criticisms of his age-based decline, Eli Manning had the bounce back season he needed to quiet critics and give fans hope for the future. In Ben Mcadoo's WCO, Manning enjoyed one of the best statistical seasons of his career. Throwing to a healthy Cruz, OBJ, RR and Shane Vereen would do a lot to help him see improvement in year 2 of the new offense. Additionally, while Will Beatty has been lost for a portion of the season, the Giants went and spent a top-10 pick on a player to help keep Eli upright in Ereck Flowers.  While he isnt top 5 at his position and only arguably top 10, Eli possesses a trait that is underratedly important among QBs: durability. Aside from being an ironman, he has the uncanny ability to turn on a switch inside of him and go Super Saiyan once he makes it to the postseason. If we can improve the pieces around him and make a run at the playoffs, fans everywhere know that Eli is a very real threat to take his team all the way. Backing up the younger (and more of a better lover) Manning is Ryan Nassib, who has shown flashes during preseason but has never really got his shot. Still, looking at some of the other QBs to come out of that draft (Landry Jones, Matt Barkley, Tyler Wilson in the 4th round alone), I'm definitely happy with the Nassib pick.  Starting CBs: I considered throwing OG and RB here, but when it comes down to it the Giants have one of the best starting CB tandems in the league. DRC and Prince Amukamara are both top 20 corners (Prince I'd put top 15), and Trumaine McBride is probably the 2nd most underrated player on our defense after Johnathan Hankins. The duo of DRC and Prince is exciting, as Rodgers-Cromartie can cover the longer, faster WRs (think Desean Jackson), while Amukamara will match up with the bigger, more physical WRs (think Dez Bryant). It isnt a #1CB/#2CB scenario, and that allows us to be much more flexible in how we scheme against opposing offenses. DRC has bought into the Spagnuolo defense so much that he has added nearly 20 pounds of muscle in the offseason, going from roughly 190 pounds last year to weighing in at 208 during OTAs. Now, you'll notice I've only talked about the starting corners and neglected to speak about our depth... well it's going to stay that way. Because who needs depth at the DB position anymore, right?! Haha, ha. Ha... sobs internally"
NYGiants,3ar1ge,Sexterminator,6,Mon Jun 22 21:39:51 2015 UTC,"Position Group Weaknesses  Safety: Right now the Giants have 4 legitimate safeties on their roster. One is rookie Landon Collins, picked in the 2nd round of the 2015 NFL Draft. The other 3 are all 5th round picks still on their rookie contracts... Mykkelle Thompson (2015), Nat Berhe (2014), and Cooper Taylor (2013). That group doesnt inspire a whole lot of confidence, and I do believe that between them they have 0 combined starts. There is reason to be cautiously optimistic about this group: Taylor was looking like a stud in 2014's preseason before succumbing to a year-ending injury. Berhe is a bona fide Special Teamer with the willingness to play whatever role he is asked to. Collins was believed to be by many the best Safety in the draft, and should be a huge boon to our run defense. Mykkelle Thompson is rangy and athletic, a Jerry Reese pick if I've ever seen one. But the lack of experience is just overwhelming. We've had Antrel Rolle holding the spot of defensive captain for years, setting the defense up and showing a great sense of leadership on and off the field. Who will take that role now? Who can call out the defensive audibles in the secondary? Are we really putting all our eggs in the Landon Collins basket? And let's say Collins is everything that we're hoping he can be, okay, great... who is our starting FS? Thompson is as raw as raw gets, Taylor will get injured stepping on a lego and Berhe, for as much love as he gets, is a very prototypical SS who I cannot see having much success in the FS role. It's possible, I suppose, to try and play Collins at FS as well if need be. But I foresee many big plays being given up by this defense due to the lack of game experience by this young, growing safety corps. I mean, things are bad enough that we're converting a former WR-turned CB into his now 3rd position in an attempt to add S depth.  3-tech DT: While Johnathan Hankins is one of the few stud NTs in the league, the DT spot opposite him is looking like one big question mark right now. Kenrick Ellis, while a nice FA pickup and a sure cause for improving our maligned run defense, has never been a full-time starter in the NFL and possseses little pass-rush capabilities. Cullen Jenkins, meanwhile, has become only really useful against the pass and is growing very old for a DT at 34. Jay Bromley was picked in the 3rd round in 2014 and is effectively a complete unknown at this point. Markus Kuhn is... well, he's Markus Kuhn. Hopefully, Bromley can take a step forward this year but as of right now, there appear to be no standouts in this DT rotation.  TE: Last year's uninspiring trio of TEs looks to be returning as the Giants will be likely to yet again field one of the worst TE groups in the NFL. Larry Donnell is average to above-average as a receiver, but is abhorrent in run-blocking. He also has a frustrating tendency to do flips every time he is tackled, which I am almost certain is directly related to his fumbling issue. Meanwhile, both veteran Daniel Fells and 4th-year man Adrien Robinson are solid in run-blocking, yet neither offers much in the way of receiving. It's possible that an Undrafted guy comes up and makes the roster (Matt LaCosse, I'm looking at you... seriously please bro we need you), but I wouldn't bet on it. All we can really do is hope Donnell shows some progression in his second year as a starter.  OT: After the draft, our Offensive Line was looking pretty set with a starting combo of Beatty-Pugh-Richburg-Schwartz-Flowers. After Will Beatty's untimely injury, though, Flowers was forced to shift out to LT prematurely. Now we have a very raw rookie playing the most difficult position on the OL. Additionally, the Giants now have something of a hole at RT. The possible candidates to fill it are: Justin Pugh, who played the position last year at a below-average level and projects much better as a Guard; Brandon Mosley, who came out of college as a Tackle but has switched to Guard since coming into the NFL; Marshall Newhouse, whose name says everything you need to know about him; and some undrafted guys. Suffice it to say, with the injury bug to continuing to plague their O-Line, the Giants are looking at fielding at least one and possibly multiple depth-level players as starters in 2015.   There we go. Hope it's good enough; kind of rushed it at work but it ended up being too long for a single post."
NYGiants,3ar1ge,Sexterminator,2,Tue Jun 23 01:28:29 2015 UTC,"Sex for prez.  Also, I bet Wynn does well this season. Unexpectedly well."
NYGiants,3ar1ge,TheCowgirlCrusher,2,Tue Jun 23 09:48:17 2015 UTC,"Yeah, if we keep 5 DEs I think he makes the cut over Selvie. And he can play DT too. I guess our boner for Richmond players is finally paying off!"
NYGiants,3ar1ge,Sexterminator,3,Tue Jun 23 11:12:28 2015 UTC,"I'll take a stab at the Training Camp Battles. I've been following OTAs and camps pretty closely, so I feel pretty good about these. You can cut/paste or use whatever you want.   Offensively, the most interesting are probably at RB and TE.   Most Interesting:   RB: The Giants are likely headed for another 3-headed monster of an attack led by Rashad Jennings, Shane Vereen and Andre Williams. The split between this group could be anywhere from 40/40/20 with Vereen seeing the least carries but more targets in the passing game, or 60/30/10 with Williams relegated to the bench in favor of the veteran Jennings. There's a chance we cut Henry Hynoski, but I think he's likely to stay. Dark horse candidates Akeem Hunt and Orleans Darkwa may pop up in training camp but are unlikely to make the final 53. It should be interesting to see how the workload falls out.   TE: The Tight End situation is probably the most fluid at the moment. Larry Donnell saw the most action last season but was often taken off the field in blocking situations in favor of Daniel Fells. Adrien Robinson, at one point dubbed ""The JPP of Tight Ends"" spent another year failing to live up to expectations. With Donnell in a walking boot for OTA's and minicamp, the Giants brought in UDFA's Matt Lacosse and Will Tye, as well as Jerome Cunningham off the practice squad. As of the end of minicamps, Cunningham was making the most noise, but Robinson and Lacosse had seen success as well. Until Donnell is out of his walking boot, we're likely to see these 3 battle for a roster spot. Cunningham appears to be the dark-horse, while Robinson is the most likely candidate to back up Donnell (who had been making an effort to improve his blocking this offseason). I think Fells is a camp casualty, and Lacosse looks like he would be a good practice squad addition if he doesn't make the team.  Somewhat Interesting:   WR: To a lesser extent, the low end of the WRs should see an interesting position battle. Beckham, Cruz, and Randle are basically assured to make the team. The Giants gave KR/PR/Gunner/WR Dwayne Harris $17.5 million over 5 years this offseason to lure him away from Dallas, so he'll likely be the 4th option. Whether the Giants keep 5, 6 or maybe even 7 WRs is yet to be seen (and probably depends on other positions - TE/RB) but Corey Washington and 5th round pick Geremy Davis seem like the next two up. Preston Parker shows a lot of grit and could sneak in as a coach favorite, and Marcus ""Soup"" Harris, a fan favorite, showed flashes at minicamp as well. Ben Edwards and Julian Talley are possible practice squad additions. The real question will be how many WRs the Giants choose to keep on the final 53 - I'll bet it's 6, and I'd bet they'll be OBJ, Cruz, Randle, D. Harris, Washington and G. Davis. Parker will be someone to keep an eye on in case of injury.   OL: There appear to be 4 starting positions locked up: Ereck Flowers will step in from Day 1 as the LT, Justin Pugh at LG, Weston Richburg at C, and Geoff Schwartz at RG. Marshall Newhouse is slated to start at RT and has been receiving reps with the 1st team all of OTAs and minicamp. Until further notice, that's the OL - but OT Brandon Mosley might push Newhouse if he struggles out of the gate. In an alternate scenario, John Jerry could fill in for either OG spot with Pugh or Schwartz kicking out to RT. The situation here is touch and go until pads go on.  Defensively, there is quite a bit in flux...  Most Interesting:  FS/SS: The biggest question mark is actually two positions- the Safeties. The Giants moved up to draft Landon Collins in the 2nd round, and he seems primed to start at one of the two. Nat Berhe was the most likely candidate to step into what is likely the FS role, but has been injured all spring. 3rd year FS Cooper Taylor, a former 5th round pick from Richmond has shown promise in his career and in the spring, but injuries have held him back so far. With the injury to Berhe, he appears to be the next man up to be given the opportunity. If Cooper falters, the Giants have played 6th round pick Mykkyle Thompson, Free Agent addition Josh Gordy, and converted CB Bennett Jackson at FS. Thus far, no one has stood out as the clear starter opposite Collins, and the Giants may look to add someone after the first round of roster cuts. Right now, I'd say Collins/Berhe start, but it's Collins/Cooper until Berhe can play. Interesting to note though, Berhe and Collins are both more known as run-stoppers and less as coverage safeties. Not to say they can't play both, but the Giants might rely more heavily on Prince and DRC if the Safeties are played to their strengths rather than asked to conform to the team's needs.  To a significantly lesser extent:   LB: Will the Giants play a 3-4 of a 4-3? Spags defenses are usually out of a 4-3 base, so we're likely to see 3 LBs. To the extent that will mean 1 MLB and 2 OLBs, Beason is the best bet to start in the middle. His injury history could mean the positions become interchangeable, but barring injury he should guard the middle of the field. My best bet for the OLBs are Devon Kennard and JT Thomas. Thomas was added this offseason after underwhelming performances from Jacquian Williams and Jameel McClain. Williams is now gone, replaced by Jonathan Casillas, who should push Thomas for the other OLB spot. Mainstay special teamer Mark Herzlich is likely on his last leg if he wants to stay with the team, and should be feeling the pressure from UDFA Cole Farrand. Farrand isn't likely to make the team, but definitely has a shot, as does Victor Butler who could see time as a special teamer. My best guess would be 6 LBs - Beason, Kennard, Thomas, Casillas, McClain, and Herzlich.   DL: JPP's holdout is bound to end eventually - either with a long-term deal or the signing of his franchise tag. Either way, he'll be rushing the passer on one side as soon as he gets to camp. The other side is up for grabs, and right now I'd guess Damontre Moore and Robert Ayers are the closest to getting it. That being said, if veteran George Selvie or rookie Owa Odighizuwa started it would not surprise me. Moore showed promise last year but missed OTAs to finish his college degree. This might have helped Selvie, Ayers or Owa, but I still think he's in the best position. As for DT, the Giants drafted Jonathan Hankins and Jay Bromley in 2013 and 2014 respectively to be the DT's of the future. Both have shown progression but the team also kept veteran Cullen Jenkins to provide some leadership, and signed Kendrick Ellis from the depths of the Jets DT spot. Any of these four could start or see time, and I am excited to get to training camp to see if one emerges. Until the pads go on, it's harder to judge these positions.   Nickel CB: Just to round out the defensive concerns, the Giants chose not to resign CB Walter Thurmond who was injured last season after being signed to be the Nickel CB. They also let Nickel CB and special teamer Zack Bowman walk. This left the position in the hands of Jayron Hosley, Trumaine McBride, and Chykie Brown. McBride seems like the odds-on favorite coming out of minicamp, but Hosley has been hanging around long enough to be considered. Chykie Brown showed promise at the end of last season and may earn the spot ahead of McBride and Hosley, but I'd put my money on McBride until someone else steps up. This could be another position that the Giants watch the final roster cuts for."
NYGiants,3ar1ge,luckyshamrok19,1 point,Tue Jun 23 02:35:19 2015 UTC,"I can see where your coming from on the cuts but I don't end up in the same spot. Preston Parker has had some big days at OTAs and I think he finds a way to persist on the roster. Davis should have a niche as a big safety target but he is a 6th rd rookie - whether he stays or goes depends on how many TEs we keep IMO. Also orleans darkwa was very effective in limited snaps, much more so than Andre.  Darkwa is threatened by vereen being signed but  I'm not as convinced he can't make the 53 man roster.   Ellis, when healthy, is very good. He could easily be a starter if we are willing to roll out hankerson and Ellis together."
NYGiants,3ar1ge,yakoos,0,Tue Jun 23 18:30:03 2015 UTC,"How the LB depth chart plays out with the free agents we brought in could be interesting, it'd be great if JT Thomas or Casillas could contribute meaningful snaps even though they were primarily brought in to be STers."

NYGiants,3aiwds,Sexterminator,5,Sat Jun 20 18:07:01 2015 UTC,"Since Donnell has been in that boot for awhile, Fells who just resigned with us this offseason looks like he'll be taking over till Donnell gets back. I feel like Fells might be able to compete for a starting spot this season."

I wouldn't be surprised if Fells didn't make the cut. Donnell, Robinson, and Tye are my top three as of right now. I also feel like Robinson will eventually win the starting job. Donnell just happens to be a great 2nd TE, a guy who can make the catches but can't block.   Regardless of everything, TE is still a weak spot on our roster."

NYGiants,3aiwds,pedro_gmen,1 point,Sun Jun 21 03:14:06 2015 UTC,"The TE's on our roster are: - Larry Donnell (Most likely starter) - Daniel Fells (most likely will back up/share reps with Larry) - Adrien Robinson  - Jerome Cunningham  - UDFA Matt LaCosse - UDFA Will Tye  So far through Mini-camps and OTA's, Donnell is still seen as the first guy up even though he came down with some type of minor Arthritis type symptoms in his left leg and was held out. I am actually unclear in Fells but I am sure he and Adrien Robinson have been splitting 1st team reps and Robinson has been impressing after a very underachieving 2014 season. Not much on Matt LaCosse and Will Tye (mostly running with 2nd to 3rd teams) but I know early during practice, LaCosse showed off his ball skills.

NYGiants,3ah6u2,DarthReilly,8,Sat Jun 20 05:46:13 2015 UTC,"You know, I was wondering about our cap situation the other day. In 2016, we are projected to have $91MM tied up in cap space. 91 freakin million. Lets say the cap increases a few million to $145MM, that gives us $54MM in cap space to play with. Assuming Eli, JPP and Prince all play lights out theyll all want lucrative contracts.  Completely ignoring the fact that the first year of any multi-year deal is usually the lowest $$ amount, we would probably be looking at the following yearly totals for the aforementioned players:  Eli Manning: $20MM  Jason Pierre-Paul: $16MM (assuming he really does play lights out)  Prince: $10MM  So thats $46MM. Still leaves us with cap space. And then you have to account the fact that a player never, ever, ever makes their yearly average in their first year unless a team has an overabundance of cap or its a very short deal. So really we're probably looking at around $30MM next season to lock these guys up.   As for RR, what is lights out? 1200 yards and 10 TDs? Good for him, he'll earn hjmself a nice pay day. I highly doubt we bring him back at that point though. Cruz is being paid big bucks and OBJ will hopefully be in the team's future. If Randle has a solid year and we can keep him for $3-5MM per year, then I'm all for it."
NYGiants,3ah6u2,Sexterminator,3,Sat Jun 20 05:54:03 2015 UTC,"Amukamara appears to be the prototypical cover 2 CB who can cover AND play the run extremely well. Cover 2 teams would value him more than we would IMO but I hope not. Honestly, I think he has more of a chance of being franchise tagged than Eli because I think Eli would be willing to play out the tag and try to hit free agency. If the team is going to try to haggle over how much he's worth and not meet him in the middle, than he's going to make them pay. And we already know that he's going to play for who ever he wants to."
NYGiants,3ah6u2,xSxHxAxRxPx,3,Sat Jun 20 06:56:06 2015 UTC,"I'd imagine Randle will go somewhere and try to be the #1 guy (see: Nicks, Smith, Manningham, etc.) but I don't think he'll get that kind of money from anyone so we'll have a chance to sign him for #2 money. Although he could get better money than we're willing/able to give him. He's very, very young for his years of experience.   JPP is as good as gone in my opinion. I don't think we'll match the open market, it won't be possible for us. And if he does play lights out would it be because of him or because of the system? Moore, Diggy, Selvie, Ayers, and Wynn need to step up this season and I think they will. I'm not actually as concerned about replacing him as I should be. I think the level behind him (Kennard, JTT, and Beason) are better than they have been for years. So that will help as well.  Eli - we'll do whatever is needed to sign him. I also don't think there is a team in the league right now who is 1 vet away from bing a great team. Bills are the only team you could make that argument for, perhaps Denver (because PM will retire.) But neither of those teams would value Eli as high as we do.  Prince - he should be priority 1a after Eli.   Also, if Flowers blows up this year, if he turns out to be a fucking stud, we may be able to get out from Beatty's contract. We'd have 3 lineman on rookie contracts, and potentially be able to draft another."

This year could change that, however.   Randle...again, unless he has a break out year, I think he knows he's a WR3 with more likelihood of moving back rather than forward.

NYGiants,3aeyud,autowikibot,1 point,Fri Jun 19 22:20:19 2015 UTC,"West Coast offense:       In American football, the ""West Coast offense"" is an offense that places a greater emphasis on passing than on running.  There are two similar but distinct offensive strategic systems which are commonly referred to as ""West Coast offenses"". Originally the term referred to the Air Coryell system popularized by Don Coryell, but, following a journalistic error, it now more commonly refers to the offensive system popularized by Bill Walsh, characterized by short, horizontal passing routes in lieu of running plays to ""stretch out"" defenses, opening up the potential for long runs or long passes.

NYGiants,3ab7ks,ablebodiedmango,3,Thu Jun 18 23:05:51 2015 UTC,I'm still holding to my belief that there is a contract year fire under Eli.  He's never been in a position where he has no contract security in front of him.  It might be giving him a rough edge he hasn't before.
NYGiants,3ab7ks,Dizzlecizzle,4,Thu Jun 18 21:03:36 2015 UTC,Fourth quarter Eli the whole season?!?
NYGiants,3ab7ks,Lextreme21,2,Fri Jun 19 07:48:19 2015 UTC,I'm sure all teams do this during the mini camps/practices but I'm glad to hear that they are reviewing tapes from last year and perfecting the simple plays. I know they're all learning a new offense still but seeing how they screw up certain plays from last season will hopefully help prevent them from making the same mistakes this year. Also hoping Eli has the best year of his career this season and signs a long term contract with us again.

NYGiants,3a7apb,ablebodiedmango,3,Wed Jun 17 21:26:21 2015 UTC,Honestly I think part of the reason Beckham came on so fast for a rookie was that he missed football for about two months.  The man clearly hates missing any football whatsoever and that kind of frustration makes you all the more grateful and determined when you're back out there.  I don't mind him being in the same kind of mindset to start this season.

NYGiants,3a80a0,ConcedeDota,2,Thu Jun 18 00:55:46 2015 UTC,Players don't have helmet restrictions in off season practice I don't think
NYGiants,3a80a0,Manning2Cruz,1 point,Thu Jun 18 02:17:25 2015 UTC,"IMO, when the NFL implemented the helmet restrictions I thought it was stupid. I really liked the different designs of the face mask. I remember Justin Tuck's helmet a few years back looked really intimidating as well as few others across the league."
NYGiants,3a80a0,afin33,2,Thu Jun 18 06:46:36 2015 UTC,Chris Canty actually started all of that. It was for a legitimate reason. He could have lost his eye. From that players started making crazy cool face masks. I live in Baltimore and hate the Ravens. People started raving about the Ray Lewis when he adapted the shredder mask when Canty went there. Pissed me off
NYGiants,3a80a0,Manning2Cruz,1 point,Thu Jun 18 19:22:26 2015 UTC,I appreciate the history. I slightly remember Canty being the originator. In general though I thought it was cool to see defensemen look intimidating to the offense.   What was wrong with his eye(s)? Injury or something else?
NYGiants,3a80a0,afin33,1 point,Mon Jun 22 23:18:52 2015 UTC,I forget exactly but something about if he got it in the eye area ever again he could lose his eye sight for the rest of his life. His helmet mad it next to impossible to get hit there because fingers and all of that could not get through. I agree it adds a gladiator aspect to the game and looks awesome. It allows creativity. You know the NFL won't allow that. Only thing is it must be terrible trying to see the ball or see the ground with all of that mask.  I just got irritated when people would think it was Ray Lewis coming up with it when Canty and then Tuck had been wearing it for years
NYGiants,3a80a0,Manning2Cruz,1 point,Tue Jun 23 12:52:34 2015 UTC,"""Only thing is it must be terrible trying to see the ball or see the ground with all of that mask."" That makes a lot of sense.

NYGiants,3a6kx4,Yes-I-Lift,13,Wed Jun 17 17:03:06 2015 UTC,"I'd swap Collins for Moore, and I like Moore a lot. But I think Collins is future defensive captain. Cannot fucking wait to see him on the field."
NYGiants,3a6kx4,CasanovaWong,1 point,Wed Jun 17 18:06:00 2015 UTC,"I thought  Collins as well, I think he can be a big time player for us. I was not sure about taking a guy that never played at this level though."
NYGiants,3a6kx4,DezBryantsMom,5,Wed Jun 17 18:32:07 2015 UTC,Moore as in the guy who hasn't even earned a starting role? You'd take him over Pugh or Richburg or Cruz?
NYGiants,3a6kx4,The_Other_Manning,3,Wed Jun 17 19:04:31 2015 UTC,"He has as good a chance as Richburg, maybe not Pugh, and Cruz can be argued. Richburg was bad last year, we hope he does better in his natural position this year but all this is right now is hope. Pugh is alright to above alright. Not great, and good if he improves this year. Cruz is 28, a slot receiver, and coming off a real bad injury. Not a great person to build a team around imho if you can only choose 5."
NYGiants,3a6kx4,DezBryantsMom,1 point,Wed Jun 17 20:52:57 2015 UTC,Moore hasn't shown anything to establish him as anything but a backup. Richburg I understand. Reports about Cruz are positive and Pugh is too young to write him off as an ok player. I know OP said he considered Kennard and Kennard was 10x better a rookie than Moore was in his third(?) year. I just don't think Moore is very good.

NYGiants,3a6kx4,The_Other_Manning,2,Wed Jun 17 20:25:52 2015 UTC,"Hankins - Young, can solidify the d-line, great talent and getting better  OBJ - No explanation needed, 2nd year explosive offensive weapon  Collins - Risky because we haven't seen him play yet, but a highly touted Safety with a full rookie contract can do wonders for developing a secondary  Flowers - Same as Collins for the o-line. Can be a future LT.  JPP or Prince - What do you wanna help, secondary or the line? Both are good/great. Prince I think is safer but JPP has more potential."
NYGiants,3a6kx4,gpost86,2,Wed Jun 17 20:56:32 2015 UTC,"OBJ, JPP, Prince, Hankins . . . the last one is tough. Either Flowers or Pugh  Kennard and Landon are honorable mentions"
NYGiants,3a6kx4,JFrey,3,Wed Jun 17 21:03:05 2015 UTC,Replace Moore with Eli and I'd say you got it.
NYGiants,3a6kx4,swagchef1,9,Wed Jun 17 18:17:47 2015 UTC,"I love Eli, but you don't rebuild with a 34 year old QB. Eli is the perfect QB to trade to a team in win now mode that's lacking a QB. Could probably get a few picks for Eli"

NYGiants,3a6kx4,kamiikoneko,1 point,Thu Jun 18 04:31:42 2015 UTC,"Prince. It's a passing league and he's damn good against the pass. Hankins, when it's a passing league and you build your D around that you need a guy in the middle who can eat up the run. He can do that in spades and he can even rush the passer. Richburg. I originally was going to say Flowers because he's got the best chance to be a LT and he's young but Richburg is young and I think LT (as a position) is ranked too high in importance by most NFL fans. Center is the most crucial member of the line. Lock down a stud (which he may or may not be) and go from there. OBJ. He's pretty good. Randle. Toughest call here. I won't even be sad if he doesn't re-sign after next season but the way I'm looking at it is that we'll have a new QB. How do we make sure he can grow into a franchise guy? Well, there's no silver bullet but giving him two weapons is helpful. Randle is much younger than Cruz and has two working knees.    Consolation round: I think keeping Eli in the 5th spot (although I didn't put the above in a specific order) would be beneficial for bringing up a new QB. Get 3 years out of Eli as player/groomer/coach. Collins hasn't played a down. Pugh has the ability to be a serviceable T and probably (hopefully) a stud at OG. I'd hate to see Kennard go but he's a LB and we don't care about them."
NYGiants,3a6kx4,JaquiskiTaterTartt,0,Wed Jun 17 19:57:38 2015 UTC,Randle sucks
NYGiants,3a6kx4,creamspinachplz,1 point,Thu Jun 18 01:49:34 2015 UTC,"OBJ, JPP, and Hankins are the three obvious selections. After that it gets pretty blurry. Ayers looks to have what it takes to succeed in an expanded role, but he's 29. I like what Kennard can be. DRC is great but aging, something similar can be said for Schwartz, McBridge, and Beatty. Both Flowers and Collins are good prospects (not too high on the others tbh), but they are risks considering they are rookies. Prince is probably the safest option after the first three. I'd have to go with OBJ, JPP, Hankins, Kennard, and Prince.  OBJ is one of the best young talents out there, and plays at a premium position.  JPP hasn't had consistent production (injury held him back for some time), but has the ability to be a quality edge rusher and is still young (26).  Hankins really came into his own in 2015. He's an already great tackle with plenty of room to grow.  Not much was expected out of Kennard considering he was a fifth-round pick, but he shined in limited action. He definitely has starting potential (possible starter this season).  Prince is not great imo, but he gets the job done, which is what you need at corner.  That means I'll be starting with an elite receiver, two quality d-linemen, a potent linebacker, and a solid corner."
NYGiants,3a6kx4,cfl1,1 point,Sun Jun 28 23:59:15 2015 UTC,"How do you not take our 2nd best player? Eli. I realize Carson isn't as proven, and he's injury prone, but he was 8-0 as the Cardinals QB this past year. an accomplished veteran QB is better than a young unproven one. Also better than a 3rd year DE."
NYGiants,3a6kx4,creamspinachplz,3,Wed Jun 17 18:53:59 2015 UTC,"My picks were not based on who has done the most for this team. If we lost all our current roster except 5 I am going for youth and highest ceiling to REBUILD a team. Moore is my one risky pick, possibly Kennard."
NYGiants,3a6kx4,donredd,4,Wed Jun 17 19:12:23 2015 UTC,JPP is your risk pick.
NYGiants,3a6kx4,Fedor1,1 point,Wed Jun 17 20:23:34 2015 UTC,"I'd agree that Moore is your risk pick, I personally like Kennard better. But it's not even close, your QB is the most important position. You don't win without a quarterback. A good one."

NYGiants,3a4tnp,EliTheGod,3,Wed Jun 17 14:16:31 2015 UTC,"If diggy can stay healthy, spags is going to love him and get absolutely all the production he can out of him.

NYGiants,3a4tnp,yakoos,-1,Wed Jun 17 15:49:33 2015 UTC,Complicated schemes have little to do with the basics like communication and play recognition.
NYGiants,3a4tnp,yakoos,2,Wed Jun 17 15:53:39 2015 UTC,"Communication and play recognition requirements definitely are impacted by scheme.  The more everyone's role changes based on the offense the more sophisticated both those things have to be.  In fact, the communication and play recognition are what make a defensive scheme complicated."
NYGiants,3a4tnp,CarlosFromPhilly,1 point,Wed Jun 17 17:00:49 2015 UTC,"You're kind of going with chicken and the egg circular logic here.    One guys a rookie the other is a second year player.  Neither knows how to take control of a NFL backfield.  Neither knows how to call out what they see or take control of their zones.  The complication of a scheme has little do with the fundamentals.  According to the coaches they are having trouble grasping the basic stuff and not just scheme dependent.  Blaming a ""complicated scheme"" for a rookie having trouble learning how to control the backfield is essentially blaming football for being football.  One of the basic skills a safety needs to have is recognizing their position on the field, the route being run and whether they need to peel off and follow another receiver or whether someone else has that assignment.  That isn't scheme dependent. That's a basic skill that requires your own eyes and ears."

NYGiants,3a2ywq,an-internet-stranger,3,Tue Jun 16 22:46:09 2015 UTC,"You can make jokes, but the reality is that we only have a few more years left in this window for another SB because Eli has only a few more years left before we have to build towards the future. If Collins pans out and FS is a big hole for us, it would make a lot of sense to go after Weddle cause he could teach the other guys things and would make our secondary amazing for a few years with Prince, DRC, Collins and Weddle. If we just don't have the money that's one thing, but if you don't want to sign him just cause he's an older player that costs a lot that's ridiculous."

Can Eli Manning pull it off?     Date Posted: Feb 3, 2008 1408 Time for Manning to show what he's got...does he have a little Brady in him??

[face_plain]     Date Posted: Feb 3, 2008 1410 Can you actually imagine what would happen if Eli led this drive?  I think my head would explode.     Date Posted: Feb 3, 2008 1415 Eli is forcing the ball to plaxico..     Date Posted: Feb 3, 2008 1416 They seem to be playing a little too conservatively right now. They need to try and pick up a bunch of yards here.     Date Posted: Feb 3, 2008 1419 He's forcing passes, he needs to calm down before he throws a bad pick.     Date Posted: Feb 3, 2008 1421 Plaxico isn't your only receiver, Eli. [face_worried]     Date Posted: Feb 3, 2008 1422 Theres that manning face...

NYGiants,39zuet,ZeroAccess,5,Tue Jun 16 15:21:52 2015 UTC,"""That day"" being the crucial point there.  I don't care if Brady had a better year, or if the Patriots were the better team all year, or anything else.  That day, that game, the Giants played better and won.  Period.  Anything else is just ""yeah, but what ifs"" which is useless.  It essentially comes down to ""If NY played worse today and the Patriots played better than we would have won""....well no shit, that's how it works.  But you didn't."

I hope JPP has some sense and realizes that he needs to go ahead and sign the franchise tag and learn as much as he can before the season starts. If he plays great this season he will get his payday."
NYGiants,39xn1t,Manning2Cruz,2,Tue Jun 16 02:17:51 2015 UTC,"Well, he's never been ready to start the season any of his other past years. Why should this be any different?"
NYGiants,39xn1t,pickleops,2,Tue Jun 16 05:08:32 2015 UTC,All i can say is I am glad Wilkerson is showing  up. i Know your guys pain
NYGiants,39xn1t,ocyries,2,Mon Jun 15 20:25:23 2015 UTC,I really don't want to see the Giants give him a long term deal yet. He should be happy taking the franchise tag.
NYGiants,39xn1t,SoulCrusher69,12,Mon Jun 15 17:40:55 2015 UTC,I want them to give him the long term deal because I believe after this year his value will be much higher.
NYGiants,39xn1t,The_GOAT_,6,Mon Jun 15 18:05:09 2015 UTC,"I have a feeling he's going to have a good season and then have a random drop off. Why I'm against a long term deal. He's had two, health noted, seasons."
NYGiants,39xn1t,SoulCrusher69,1 point,Mon Jun 15 19:18:24 2015 UTC,"Well, if he has a good season we're going to pay him anyway. If it's good, he's going to ask for more. In both of these scenarios we are paying him. Paying him now just costs less."
NYGiants,39xn1t,The_GOAT_,1 point,Mon Jun 15 19:52:47 2015 UTC,"Not if we let him walk if he prices himself above what we can afford, which is entirely acceptable at this point. He isn't Eli, who will be paid by the Giants regardless. There is a limit as to how much we would pay him before telling him he should look elsewhere.  He is going to get his Top ~3 money this year (which is generous). He peaked at a perfect time - we wouldn't have our 4th SB without him. But his health and consistency have both been huge issues, and every offseason it's a new ""Here is why JPP will return to form"" song, when it really hasn't happened. He had a good year last year, don't get me wrong, but his inconsistencies drop his value to below what he will most likely want from a second contract."
NYGiants,39xn1t,HowYaGuysDoin,1 point,Mon Jun 15 20:39:30 2015 UTC,No one is happy with a franchise tag  if they think they can score a big contract.  If he gets injured he is fucked and so are the giants
NYGiants,39xn1t,ConcedeDota,1 point,Mon Jun 15 23:41:58 2015 UTC,"There has to be a reason why JPP has been with the team 5+ years compared to jon beason's 2, and yet Jon Beason is a captain on defense. Maybe, for as good as JPP is, he isnt necessarily the kind of guy whose presence (or absence) impacts the team atmosphere. Let the guy do his own thing. If you follow him on Instagram he's doing pass rush drills every day. I'm sure he'll show up ready to ball out."
NYGiants,39xn1t,squirtle28,0,Wed Jun 17 20:28:19 2015 UTC,He's so lazy. We should just cut him and be done with him. He hasn't played well in years anyhow.
NYGiants,39yrpd,BlackSails666,3,Mon Jun 15 21:53:36 2015 UTC,"My favorite beat writer is Jordan Raanan of nj.com. I think he covers general Giants news as well as anyone, but I like his analysis better than anyone else's, and he seems to be really well tuned in to what's going on with the Giants FO. He knew the Giants were very high on Ereck Flowers very early in the draft process and he called the Flowers pick when all the writers were putting their final picks in.  He has two recent articles about Evan Mathis that I think we're great and are a good example of his work.   I also like the Giants SB Nation site BigBlueView. There's good coverage there from Ed Valentine and the other BBV contributors. The comments sections are very active and will give you a good sense of how some of the online Giants community feels.   Most Giants fans seem to hate Dan Graziano, ESPN's Giants beat writer, but I like him. He is generally lower on the Giants than most other writers, but the Giants have had a lot of problems these past two years and he has given what he feels is an honest assessment of the team. I think he is a good contrast to the more homeristic perspectives from BBV.   People also like Ralph Vacciano (sp?) from New York Daily News but I don't read him much so I can't comment on the quality.   Hope this helps."

NYGiants,39y0pb,ablebodiedmango,11,Mon Jun 15 18:44:36 2015 UTC,"It's probably worth the cost of a plane ticket and a steak dinner to let the medical folks take a look at his knee, but I wouldn't count on anything coming from it.  The timing of this by the Falcons screams ""we don't expect him to be healthy for the season.""  If it was purely a cost move, he'd have been released months ago."
NYGiants,39y0pb,3rdAnnual,5,Mon Jun 15 19:11:58 2015 UTC,June cuts make it cheaper than cutting him before.
NYGiants,39y0pb,THATBUSFROMSPEED,1 point,Mon Jun 15 22:41:41 2015 UTC,"Yes, but during FA can't you stipulate players as ""post-June 1st"" cuts?  I seem to remember us doing that with some people last offseason."
NYGiants,39y0pb,3rdAnnual,1 point,Mon Jun 15 23:43:54 2015 UTC,"Yes.  David Baas was designated as a ""post-June-1"" cut, but released sometime in the Feb-Mar timeframe. IIRC, teams can use this twice per offseason, so unless ATL had 2 other expensive cuts that they wanted shifted to 2016, there was no Cap-related reason to delay Baker's release."
NYGiants,39y0pb,squirtle28,0,Tue Jun 16 00:44:23 2015 UTC,Could also coincide with them genuinely not knowing whether they wanted to release him or not.  Factor in whether they wanted to hold on to the two exceptions and they didn't really have much to lose by waiting.
NYGiants,39y0pb,TheWolfmann,2,Tue Jun 16 18:11:30 2015 UTC,"Are there any examples of where moves like this have been successful? Signing a free agent left tackle or other OL as a stopgap? I'm just skeptical of the marginal increase that adding a Jake Long or a Sam Baker can provide.  I think the best long-term solution is to just place faith in our coaches as well as our OL depth.  Then again, we open in a HUGE game at the cowboys, then we're home against washington 2 weeks later. We cant have the g-men starting off the season in a big hole again."

NYGiants,39u8b2,3rdAnnual,1 point,Sun Jun 14 22:28:15 2015 UTC,"When a free agent remains unsigned for this long, there are 3 possible explanations:  1) the gap between the player's expectations and what teams are willing to pay him; 2) medical concerns; 3) he's just not an NFL-caliber player anymore.  Jacquian was never a great player.  An adequate backup-caliber WIL and ST guy.  He got his shot at starting, and never developed the instincts and toughness to go with his speed.  (Ever watch him blitz?  It's almost like he actively seeks out a blocker to knock him on his butt.)  Maybe he's holding out hope that an injury will push a team to offering something better than a veteran-minimum deal; maybe he's still hurting; maybe teams would rather throw a UDFA with more potential to develop out there as their backup WIL."

NYGiants,39lus3,overbored47,16,Fri Jun 12 17:20:39 2015 UTC,"Long. He would be way more affordable, and directly address our need at left tackle.     Mathis would be an upgrade at left guard, but the money he will eventually get would put us in a rough place.  Furthermore, it still doesn't address the LT issue (though it would alleviate some of the stress of putting a rookie tackle there).    IF Long is healthy, then Long. All day.  Not really a question, IMO.    The only question is how his ACL will recover, and if he gets healthy whether or not we will be able to win the inevitable fight for him. Check out the Broncos LT situation to see what I mean."
NYGiants,39lus3,CarlosFromPhilly,3,Fri Jun 12 17:44:09 2015 UTC,"Taking the money out of the situation, same answer?"
NYGiants,39lus3,CarlosFromPhilly,6,Fri Jun 12 17:46:13 2015 UTC,"I think so. Long has been a multi pro bowl LT. Top 5/10 LT last time he was able to play, in 2013.    We have athletic, starting caliber guards, we don't have the same at tackle, esp. not left.  Flowers was going to be an interesting if not great fit at RT with Beatty at left. Now that he is hurt, the situation gets complicated.    A healthy long addresses that directly. Mathis-- again, while an upgrade-- still leaves us with a young, inexperienced left tackle and a guard playing right tackle. Two mismatches. Not good at all.    Long all day."
NYGiants,39lus3,ActualBreck,7,Fri Jun 12 17:51:23 2015 UTC,"No offense dude but Long is probably a shell of his former self at this point. Nobody signed him this offseason, and that's while he's supposedly healthy. Those tears just killed him."
NYGiants,39lus3,CarlosFromPhilly,3,Fri Jun 12 18:28:14 2015 UTC,"He's not ""supposedly healthy."" He is still going through recovery and rehab, on schedule and supposedly slated to be healthy by pre-season. That has been known. He hasn't been signed because it would be silly for him to sign before his recovery.    Remember-- ACL surgery is not the risk that it used to be.      Read up on his progress. You're a bit off with this one.  http://www.sportsmedia101.com/newyorkgiants/2015/05/31/new-york-giants-in-no-rush-to-sign-free-agent-jake-long-report/"
NYGiants,39lus3,luckyshamrok19,3,Fri Jun 12 18:43:55 2015 UTC,"Not only this, but I think people are looking at this backwards. It's not so much that no team has signed him - it's that he hasn't signed with a team yet. His lack of a current job is not the result of a lack of interest.   And yes, he's still recovering - so there's no incentive for him to pick a team quickly. In fact, the longer he waits, the more likely a desperate team will offer to pay him more for his services (even if it's only a 1-year rental because of the injury concerns).  I think you're spot on, and I'd be surprised if he signed with any team before training camp. It's not like he needs to relearn the position."
NYGiants,39lus3,rockyroad99,0,Sun Jun 14 18:59:19 2015 UTC,This is his second tear though. Frankly we just need quality bodies out there. I rather have a healthy pro-bowl caliber guard than ex-pro bowl LT coming off two knee surgeries.
NYGiants,39lus3,CarlosFromPhilly,2,Fri Jun 12 18:53:49 2015 UTC,"If he's healthy enough to start, I want him. Remember-- this isn't a career signing. This would be a contract designed to get us a starting, quality tackle to hold down the position for the 6-8 weeks that Beatty is out, and after that to be a veteran presence capable of substituting on either side. No one is arguing that he would make sense as a little big term roster position, but that's not what this is about.      Mathis is an upgrade, but it doesn't address the mismatches at the tackle positions.  We need a tackle. We don't need an overpriced guard.  Comparing them is strange, but if Long is healthy it's not really a logical comparison.    If long does not recover, the point is moot. If he recovers in time for training or pre season, then signing him is a no brainer.    He's either healthy and we sign him, not healthy and we don't.  Walking away from a healthy Jake long is absurd."
NYGiants,39lus3,Ny80giants,1 point,Fri Jun 12 19:14:10 2015 UTC,"Neither of these signing would be a career signing seeing as Mathis is 33 or 34. Give Mathis the money  he wants for a year, he may even take a little less with the aspect of playing his former team. Longs past really is irrelevant because of his injuries. In my opinion Mathis would be a better signing but I do see your points"
NYGiants,39lus3,rockyroad99,1 point,Fri Jun 12 19:28:56 2015 UTC,Yeah I just don't know if he will be ready a lot earlier than Beatty. And I never said we should overpay for Mathis. I just thought signing Mathis would provide us with a G with Pugh and Flowers at the Tackle spot. Massive upgrade from whoever the hell we start there.
NYGiants,39lus3,CarlosFromPhilly,1 point,Fri Jun 12 20:23:22 2015 UTC,"I don't either. If he is, there will be a war over him. If he's not, we have issues on our O Line that Mathis cannot not fix.  That said, Mathis will probably get 3-4mil. That is a luxury we likely cannot afford."

Beatty just tore his pectoral muscle, which should keep him out for 6 months or so and is hard for an OL to deal with. Long is recovering from what has become a 'nominal' surgery in the NFL, and is far removed from his surgery (7 months or so)... Long will most likely be ready around August-September, Beatty not until late November."

NYGiants,39lus3,CarlosFromPhilly,1 point,Sun Jun 14 02:42:05 2015 UTC,"You realize he has to agree to the contract, right? If his rehab is on schedule, and he's going to be fine this summer (which is expected for his injury), then he will be in massive demand.    There is no reason for him to sign a low end contract when he can potentially end up being a top ten left tackle.    His agent is going to want a big contract as much as a team wants him to have a cheap one.    If he is going to be healthy, he has the keys. Not the teams."
NYGiants,39lus3,toofastkindafurious,0,Sun Jun 14 03:22:32 2015 UTC,wow he has to agree to the contract? i had no idea. Please tell me more.
NYGiants,39lus3,RickSmith123,3,Sun Jun 14 03:48:57 2015 UTC,"At the same price? Mathis just because he's reliable. Long would be a cheap pickup though and could start at LT, but his health is a factor. We can't really afford Mathis, so I'd take Long."
NYGiants,39lus3,Makes_Poor_Decisions,3,Fri Jun 12 18:01:58 2015 UTC,"We NEED a LT, don't necessarily need a guard at this time. It would be nice for some depth and probably an upgrade, but at this point I don't think it's worth spending that much money on Mathis. Long has the advantage of being both a tremendous talent when healthy and available for a much lower pricetag, AND fills a need on the roster. Mathis is great talent as well, but is much more expensive and doesn't make the comparative impact that Long would.  This is of course assuming we can somehow keep Long healthy, which is somewhat dubious at this point."
NYGiants,39lus3,3rdAnnual,2,Fri Jun 12 18:03:12 2015 UTC,"With Long, everything depends on the medical.  How healthy is he, when will he be in playing shape, and how much have his injuries put a ceiling on his probable level of play, going forward?  Nobody knows the answers to those questions except for actual physicians who have examined him (maybe).  If he's healthy, you sign him, throw him in at RT, and let him compete with Beatty if/when he comes off the PUP list.  Mathis could certainly help in 2015, but, IMO, the fit isn't strong enough for the Giants to offer as much as other teams are likely to.  He's best at LG, and the Giants are convinced that Justin Pugh is their guy at LG-- they want the Flowers-Pugh-Richburg left side of recent high draft picks to bond and be the cornerstone of the offense for the next 3+ years.  I don't think they would interrupt that to bring in a 34-year-old short-term fill-in.  If they went for Mathis, they'd probably play him at RG, where his value is somewhat lower.  A team with a burning need at LG will likely be willing to bid more than NYG would.    To answer the question, I guess it's Long, if he's healthy, and Mathis if he's not.  But, IMO, you don't get much in the way of useful discussions if you simply disregard the cost issue."

With him dedicating himself full time to the event, he could be really good."

You're still dead on though, he's going to be great with some pro coaching.    I also thought it was weird that the article never says what kind of jump.

I was a huge fan of his even though he had a slow start to his football career due to multiple reasons.  I knew he was going to be a special player once the line and the team got together.  I was so disappointed when his injury happened.  The way he handled it was very inspirational though.  He always stayed positive and set a new goal immediately after he retired.  Really happy for him and wish him the best in his new career.

NYGiants,39hnwf,CarlosFromPhilly,5,Fri Jun 12 20:51:21 2015 UTC,"I don't think that the Giants would abandon or postpone their ""Pugh to LG"" plans because they signed a short-term fill-in.  That's where they see Justin's long-term best fit, and its also Mathis's best position.  If they sign a Guard now, it'd be either for depth or for the RG spot.  (And it would be a sign that Schwartz's health is worse than they're letting on.)  Either way, Mathis wouldn't likely be a great fit in terms of price and skill set."

Flowers playing along side Mathis with Pugh on the right side would be an upgrade all around, esp. if Beatty comes back strong and gets Flowers to the right side.    I don't think we would pay the premium to sign Mathis, but if we did he would not be a right guard."
NYGiants,39hnwf,CarlosFromPhilly,1 point,Thu Jun 11 20:07:28 2015 UTC,Does Schwartz play RT in this scenario?
NYGiants,39hnwf,Engineers_Disasters,1 point,Fri Jun 12 00:29:24 2015 UTC,"Yes, until Beatty comes back.  Then Beatty LT, Flowers RT Schwartz vs Pugh for RG."
NYGiants,39hnwf,CarlosFromPhilly,1 point,Fri Jun 12 00:34:35 2015 UTC,If Beatty comes back.
NYGiants,39hnwf,KingDusty,2,Fri Jun 12 12:26:59 2015 UTC,Yes. If.    :\
NYGiants,39hnwf,hensen41,5,Fri Jun 12 12:52:45 2015 UTC,If we could afford him it would. He's one of the best guards in the NFL even if he's kind of old
NYGiants,39hnwf,SourMgk,5,Fri Jun 12 12:58:38 2015 UTC,Agree! What happens when Beatty comes back though? That'd be interesting...

NYGiants,39hnwf,CarlosFromPhilly,0,Thu Jun 11 23:21:59 2015 UTC,Yep
NYGiants,39hnwf,therealjerseytom,4,Fri Jun 12 03:25:14 2015 UTC,Don't think they would do that. Richburg is a young guy that needs to be developed and they expect him to be a long-term starting center.
NYGiants,39hnwf,rockyroad99,3,Fri Jun 12 03:26:52 2015 UTC,"Totally Agree, Richburg should be a great center as this is his natural position, he played pretty well at left guard (although there were a few times he faltered) so going back to his natural position should positively effect his play tremendously"

NYGiants,39hnwf,izokronus,1 point,Thu Jun 11 20:09:32 2015 UTC,Mathis PFF was great and he knows the division well. We need to keep Pugh at T since we don't have capable bodies out there.

NYGiants,39hnwf,Elided_Ego,5,Fri Jun 12 11:27:38 2015 UTC,How much cap space do we have left?
NYGiants,39hnwf,Frosssty,6,Fri Jun 12 12:44:59 2015 UTC,About $7 million total. Not sure we have enough though because we can't give it all to Mathis. Gotta have room for other transactions that must occur after the inevitable injuries.
NYGiants,39hnwf,EliTheGod,4,Thu Jun 11 20:20:30 2015 UTC,"He was on a 5 year, $25 million deal, so you have to figure that's his floor. If he would be willing to come down to say, $4 million for this season with raises to kick in next year and possibly the year after, that would be the way to sign him.  All that being said, you're still right - we don't have the space nor will this happen."
NYGiants,39hnwf,Sailor_Chris,3,Thu Jun 11 20:32:39 2015 UTC,"Only way he goes below that is if there's genuinely zero interest at that price range around the league, which is actually possible given he's 34 years old. I wouldn't bank on it though."

NYGiants,39itqc,cocacocacocaine,32,Fri Jun 12 00:41:59 2015 UTC,"Without question he's going to have his number retired by the Giants.  Simms has his number retired, and Manning is not only ahead of Simms now (in multiple ways), he will only add to his legacy.  He is the all-time passing leader for the NY Giants (and holds several of the individual stat records); he has won (and MVP'd) in 2 Super Bowls; he will finish with the most games played by a Giant.  He can conceivably break Brett Favre's consecutive game played streak.  The list goes on and on (without getting into his demeanor on and off the field).  This is a no-brainer."
NYGiants,39itqc,briankev,2,Fri Jun 12 01:50:39 2015 UTC,"I don't think Eli will break the consecutive starts record, he will have to play another 8 seasons plus two games into a 9th season to tie the regular season record.   Eli would be playing at 43 years old while Favre stopped at 41.  Favre's record is pretty much untouchable.  Everything else stands though, Eli has smashed almost all the Giants QB records and the Giants will absolutely retire #10."
NYGiants,39itqc,Capt91,3,Fri Jun 12 16:00:54 2015 UTC,"Simms should not have had his number retired, his career has not aged well."
NYGiants,39itqc,cracked6,13,Fri Jun 12 03:00:38 2015 UTC,"Simms deserved it. He had a very good career, brought the Giants their first Super Bowl and when he retired was the greatest QB in Giants history."
NYGiants,39itqc,DarthReilly,7,Fri Jun 12 04:24:48 2015 UTC,I agree with you. It had been 30 years since a championship and 20 since they were relevant. We think too little of him probably.
NYGiants,39itqc,Tuckason,-2,Fri Jun 12 11:27:27 2015 UTC,"I really do thinl he was more a product of his defense. Letting a backup step in and win another super bowl without a sweat, kinda shows that."
NYGiants,39itqc,cracked6,10,Fri Jun 12 06:20:43 2015 UTC,He went 22/25 in his MVP Super Bowl. Please.
NYGiants,39itqc,Tuckason,-5,Fri Jun 12 11:25:55 2015 UTC,"Ok a good Super Bowl performance isn't worthy of getting your number retired. He was a good player, but he had more of an impact than Strahan or Carson? Both of them don't have their numbers retired."
NYGiants,39itqc,cracked6,6,Fri Jun 12 13:44:17 2015 UTC,Strahan will eventually have his number retired. You don't seem to wonder why nobody has worn #92 since he retired
NYGiants,39itqc,ablebodiedmango,1 point,Fri Jun 12 15:54:36 2015 UTC,"They tried to retire Simms number the year after he retired but he refused and did it the year after, it's been 8 years since Strahan has been gone. Of course they're gonna have to retire it, but maybe they should wait this long for everyone. Simms seems like it was rushed because he was able to play competent QB with one of the greatest defenses of all time, not that he was one of the best players in Franchise history."
NYGiants,39itqc,cracked6,1 point,Fri Jun 12 18:55:53 2015 UTC,A SB performance got Namath into the Hall of Fame. Career 50.1 completion percentage. If that's HoF worthy Simms definitely merits getting #11 retired. Injuries also hurt Simms' career numbers. Anyone think Bo Jackson was a crap player for only playing 3+ seasons due to injury? Let's give Simms the benefit of the doubt.
NYGiants,39itqc,BriscoMorgan,1 point,Fri Jun 12 18:56:08 2015 UTC,"What does NFL HOF have to do with anything? Namath's numbers are good enough for the era and he is a historical figure, you can't tell the story of the NFL without Namath. They have nothing to do with what the Giants do. What most hurt Simms is that another QB was able to step in and win without missing a beat. Simms is good, but not no one wear his number ever again, atleast for this franchise."
NYGiants,39itqc,cracked6,2,Fri Jun 12 18:59:32 2015 UTC,Simms' arrival marked the start of a turnaround for a franchise that had 13 non-winning seasons from '64 through '78. I think his career and his SB performance merit hanging 11 up at the stadium.
NYGiants,39itqc,BriscoMorgan,1 point,Fri Jun 12 19:32:02 2015 UTC,So should they make Eli a sportscaster on CBS too?
NYGiants,39itqc,SassyMoron,11,Fri Jun 12 17:02:52 2015 UTC,Be aware that we have a lot of retired numbers. Can't retire them all.

NYGiants,39itqc,Elided_Ego,1 point,Fri Jun 12 02:41:33 2015 UTC,At least with the Yankees players don't have like 20 numbers to start with.
NYGiants,39itqc,TheWolfmann,1 point,Sat Jun 13 00:54:50 2015 UTC,They can just un-retire old numbers like Syracuse just did.   Bleh.
NYGiants,39itqc,Capt91,7,Fri Jun 12 16:54:21 2015 UTC,Absolutely. Best quarterback in franchise history both statistically and in terms of championships.
NYGiants,39itqc,RickSmith123,6,Fri Jun 12 03:20:26 2015 UTC,"The Giants have pretty much stopped retiring numbers.  Simms and LT were the last ones to get in.  The intent being that the ""Ring of Honor"" will take its place.    Now, they haven't given out Strahan's 92 since he left, but they also haven't formally retired it.  At some point, they'll let guys start using it again.  I expect the same thing with #10.  Permanent retirement would probably take another Al Blozis situation.  (Blozis was a Tackle, drafted in 1942, and an All-Pro in 1943.  But in '44 he finally convinced the Army to waive its size limitations to let him sign up.  He was killed in action in France in 1945.  No Giant has worn #32 since then.)"
NYGiants,39itqc,3rdAnnual,4,Fri Jun 12 14:06:51 2015 UTC,I would be surprised if we ever see another player wear the number 10 again.
NYGiants,39itqc,Syncharmony,5,Fri Jun 12 02:00:18 2015 UTC,Who else is more worthy? But it won't happen because Eli will play forever.
NYGiants,39itqc,InspectorBlack,5,Fri Jun 12 02:54:30 2015 UTC,"Yes.  And on ""the we cant retire all the numbers debate""  Oh yes we can, theres always more room for a 10a 10v2 etc..."

NYGiants,39itqc,cellcell,1 point,Fri Jun 12 17:18:08 2015 UTC,I'd say retiring Eli's number 10 is pretty much a given.  The only thing that would complicate it is if he doesn't end up signing an extension with the Giants and somehow plays somewhere else for the rest of his career (which is also unlikely).
NYGiants,39itqc,jbl429,1 point,Fri Jun 12 14:10:31 2015 UTC,"Here is the list of the retired numbers - and after review, I think he has a strong case for them to do so."
NYGiants,39itqc,overbored47,1 point,Fri Jun 12 17:11:38 2015 UTC,Definitely. But the problem is we kind of have too many numbers retired already. What we might do is just unofficially retire it: we don't retire the jersey but we don't let anyone else wear No. 10 ever. Kind of what the Lakers are gonna do with Kobe's No. 8
NYGiants,39itqc,Cylon2910,6,Fri Jun 12 01:10:22 2015 UTC,What's the point of that? The number still doesnt get used?
NYGiants,39itqc,onebandonesound,3,Fri Jun 12 01:30:13 2015 UTC,"Yeah, if anything that's disrespectful to Eli. ""Oh we're sorry, you're good enough to get your number retired, but we're not going to honor you with the ceremony or formality"""

NYGiants,39gj8q,smushkreeg,7,Thu Jun 11 18:25:40 2015 UTC,PFF had him as one of the more reliable safeties in the NFL the year we won the Super Bowl. He wasn't the huge playmaker we thought he would be but he was still good.

NYGiants,39i3rg,SaintMongoose,4,Thu Jun 11 21:45:18 2015 UTC,Fair enough. I'm really interested to see how he pans out.
NYGiants,39i3rg,SaintMongoose,2,Thu Jun 11 21:48:00 2015 UTC,"So am I. That said, I don't see him winning a starting job this season. He really seemed to be slow to deal with speed from the CFL tape I watched of him, and I think he'll need time to adjust. I see him as the backup center this season."
NYGiants,39i3rg,3rdAnnual,3,Thu Jun 11 22:23:36 2015 UTC,"His struggle will be making the team.  If he beats out Dallas Reynolds to be the #2 Center, it'll have been a good pickup for the Giants.  Expecting him to push for a starting job is unreasonable at this point."
NYGiants,39i3rg,luckyshamrok19,2,Fri Jun 12 00:19:28 2015 UTC,"Ralph Vacchiano, the Giants beat writer for the Daily News wrote this  a few days ago about Jones.  In short: He's coming from the CFL where guys have to line up at least 1 yard off the line of scrimmage so he has a lot to work on technique wise, but he definitely shows promise and seems motivated.   My guess? Long shot to make the roster as a backup, more likely than not a practice squad stash."

Romo had ""black elvis"" I forgot who was pretty generic, might have been stafford, but the ""hurry hurry"". I've heard the ""LETS GO"". Just to note that the play clock is down and we have to get this snap off. The issue with using the same call over and over is that guys get good jumps on the other side of the ball. Then again, that also helps with the hard count. You win some, you lose some."

NYGiants,39c483,darkeagle91,8,Wed Jun 10 21:28:31 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't write off the Pats just yet. And the Cowboys will have to prove they can run the ball again.

NYGiants,397oa5,ArabianGoogles,2,Wed Jun 10 00:25:49 2015 UTC,"The article brings up a good point that I manage to keep forgetting when I think of Vereen.  He's one of the better blocking RB's in the league which is a trait that doesn't get enough love.  A great blocker like we had in Bradshaw really adds another level of security for the QB and Bradshaw didn't have as good of hands as Vereen has.  So he will help to open up the passing game in two ways, by being an extra target that needs to be guarded and by also picking up blitzes and helping with protection to give extra time when he's not a target.    I really like the pick up, I think a good blocking back is something we have missed with Bradshaw left and is one of the reasons why our O-line has looked so poor."
NYGiants,397g1y,RickSmith123,6,Tue Jun 9 20:18:32 2015 UTC,"I like him, and the fact that he is from Southern. But I reserve judgement until I see him block. He is not known as a blocker, but maybe he picked some things up on the practice squad."
NYGiants,397g1y,dagaboy,0,Tue Jun 9 20:52:55 2015 UTC,We have Fells to block. I'd like Cunningham to take Adrien Robinson's spot.
NYGiants,397g1y,noahruns,4,Tue Jun 9 21:42:45 2015 UTC,A-Rob is our best blocker
NYGiants,397g1y,dagaboy,0,Tue Jun 9 23:11:34 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't expect Fells to make the team this year. He is a great run blocker with good hands, and a decent pass blocker, but he gives you nothing at all athletically. Based on what I saw last year, Robinson should be able to beat him this out this year. And so far he has made the most of Donnell's absence, working with the ones. If Donnell doesn't really pick it up as a blocker this season, he will not start for long. He was literally one of the worst in the NFL last year, which is OK for a converted QB, but not for two years in a row. He says his biggest problem is poor hand placement, and that he worked hard on it over the winter. Matt LaCosse looks like he could develop into a two way threat."
NYGiants,397g1y,Manning2Cruz,3,Tue Jun 9 23:31:32 2015 UTC,"He looks good, but it's only OTA's. I would like to see what he's like when they're in pads and there is actually contact."
NYGiants,397g1y,pinata_penis_pump2,3,Tue Jun 9 21:28:05 2015 UTC,I'm not going to make any judgement on an unproven player until training camp.

NYGiants,3968wo,WeTarScientists,2,Tue Jun 9 18:41:38 2015 UTC,We should be able to stash Davis on the practice squad. I don't see any team signing him to the active roster. I am in love with his size and hands.

NYGiants,3968wo,Manning2Cruz,8,Tue Jun 9 18:05:06 2015 UTC,"Marcus Harris, who was generally thought to be ahead of Washington t the end of camp last year, and expected to play a significant role during the season, but ended up IRed. Soup had a great preseason, and also stood out on special teams. While Washington was a playmaker in preseason games, the coaches were not blown away by his grasp of the offense or route running skills, and were openly critical of his special teams play. He kind of whined about it at the end of the season. This year, they have nothing but praise for his offensive play. Special teams do not yet factor of course.   I didn't mention Cruz, because they planned for for his absence and stocked up accordingly. Harris and ODB were expected to be practicing and this point."

Absolutely wrecked."

NYGiants,393ot2,noahruns,6,Tue Jun 9 02:29:10 2015 UTC,He's old as fuck and starting him over in a new offense probably wouldn't be that beneficial.
NYGiants,393ot2,KingDusty,5,Tue Jun 9 01:24:16 2015 UTC,"WR is already our most crowded position, as we have 12 on the roster competing for probably 6 spots. We don't need a 37 year old Reggie Wayne learning a new offense when we have a lot of young talent to develop."

NYGiants,392ose,The_Other_Manning,6,Mon Jun 8 20:43:18 2015 UTC,"Actual answer: Joe Buck. He's asleep in the booth, I think. Takes the air out of the game with his lazy, monotone announcing.  Homer answer: Troy Aikman. Fuck that guy. Shouldn't be allowed to call NFCE games, and certainly shouldn't be allowed to call Cowboys games, that biased fuck.  And FWIW, Collinsworth is one of my favorite color guys. Are you ready to to change your mind about Collinsworth? Don't forget this.   ""Oh my goodness! ... You have to be kidding me.

Yeah he lacks excitement of Gus Johnson (who totally overdoes it), but the guys the #1 play by play. He's supposed to be like that. Summerall, who most people consider the best, was the same way. 20 years from now we might look back on Buck/Aikman the same way as we do Summerall/Madden. And Buck's improved on that in recent years anyway. Sometimes less is more.  Drunk uncle applies to Dierdorf pretty well, but in a way makes him entertaining.  Simms is a Giant legend but he seems to have lost his marbles in recent years.  The worst I always thought was Bryant Gumbel when he did games on NFLN.  Michaels/Collinsworth is still the best team though. Al is what he is, Collinsworth is smart and also brutally honest."

I've lived my whole life in this town, so when I was 9, he was dominating the Gateway Conference.

NYGiants,38ybk2,Travkin2,5,Wed Jun 10 18:54:02 2015 UTC,Mhmmm. And where do I make these bets? I'd gladly put down $20 for them to win the SB and rake in $640.

NYGiants,38wrkx,IShouldWorkforESPN,10,Sun Jun 7 16:04:28 2015 UTC,"Contrary to what keeps getting parroted here, /r/NFL actually recognizes that Eli is a solid franchise QB and has had some of the best playoff performances in years.  The clutch articles get posted there pretty regularly... They just don't recognize him as a current top five guy, which he hasn't been in the discussion for in a while.    They're not a very anti-giants sub, despite the fact that there is an inordinate number of Cowboys and Patriots fans there right now.  If all falls into place, and McAdoo's second year playbook magic starts working, they will absolutely give him the credit where it's due.     In the meantime, guys like Rodgers, Brady, Big Bro, et al are going to get all of the love.  It only makes sense.  Once Eli has another top ten season, it won't be an issue."
NYGiants,38wrkx,CarlosFromPhilly,5,Sun Jun 7 16:50:09 2015 UTC,"Plus, I LOVE the underdog/ unrecognized attitude  the Giants take on."
NYGiants,38w8lq,xSxHxAxRxPx,12,Sun Jun 7 10:26:07 2015 UTC,Jennings was pretty much the primary back last season because Williams was a rookie. I think his touches are cut back with Vereen in the lineup as well and hopefully he can have a healthy season. I think Jennings has the bigger year if this is true.
NYGiants,38w8lq,SevenwithaT,2,Sun Jun 7 11:29:03 2015 UTC,"Agree with this. Not like Jennings had a particularly great year or anything, but Williams was just... bad. On a lot of plays.  Basically, if the OL can create a big enough hole, I'd rather have Williams for that speed/strength combo. But with a bad run-blocking OL, I'll take the RB with some vision, in this case Jennings. Hopefully Williams develops more this year though, he actually wasnt as bad in the passing game as I was expecting."
NYGiants,38w8lq,Sexterminator,6,Sun Jun 7 18:53:31 2015 UTC,"Jennings got off to such a hot start last year before the injury bug bit him. If he can stay healthy, I think he could be the real deal."
NYGiants,38w8lq,atmosphere-,5,Sun Jun 7 12:51:13 2015 UTC,All I can think about is 2008 Earth Wind and Fire.  I really hope we can sort out the situation at LT...

NYGiants,38w8lq,cincodelavan,6,Sun Jun 7 17:40:47 2015 UTC,Andre Williams had a rough start to his career running behind hot garbage.  He showed me enough flashes of his true talent that I'm confident he'll develop into at the very least a solid RB1.
NYGiants,38w8lq,LeDudicus,3,Sun Jun 7 21:49:06 2015 UTC,"I'll be the contrarian who says Andre Williams has a better statistical season.  Williams' shortfall was in his vision, primarily. He impatiently smashed into his own lineman instead of waiting for blocks to develop.  If he had waited for the blocks to develop..... he wouldn't have done much better, because the blocking was pretty awful.  Good news:   That's a coachable rookie problem. It's fixable. I think the o-line will improve this (even sans Beatty) this year in rush-blocking   With that said, all signs point to a real rotation happening this year. This team can field a competent RBBC, and I hope they embrace it."
NYGiants,38w8lq,VTFD,2,Mon Jun 8 13:07:45 2015 UTC,"I forget which game, but I distinctly remember AW bobbling a handoff.  After a moment he got control and busted a big run up the middle.  The announcer made a point of the fact that if he was more patient waiting for holes to open, he would get more big runs."
NYGiants,38w8lq,the_man_who_nox,2,Tue Jun 9 20:56:18 2015 UTC,"If Jennings can stay healthy, he will. If not, it'll be a mix up Vereen and Williams, possibly picking up a free agent as well. Honestly, I don't think Williams is very good, and I don't see him becoming a good primary RB."
NYGiants,38w8lq,serfis,12,Sun Jun 7 12:08:35 2015 UTC,"Yeah you know, a rookie RB running behind a piece meal, oft injured offensive line probably isn't the best showcase of his abilities.. Give him a chance"

NYGiants,38w8lq,the_man_who_nox,1 point,Tue Jun 9 20:56:38 2015 UTC,"Jennings can fight through tough spots, so if the o-line isn't blocking well then he will have a bigger year. If the o-line plays better, then Williams and Vereen become more effective.  I'm hoping we use all 3 guys as much as possible because I don't think any of them are feature back material. That's not a knock against them, just saying they are all capable of being great in a system as opposed to being used 15+ carries a game."
NYGiants,38w8lq,yallcorny,1 point,Sun Jun 7 16:25:47 2015 UTC,"Who has a bigger year   The Giants.  Remember 2008?  There's a new Earth Wind and Fire in town, y'all.    Between Vereen, Jennings and Williams, McAdoo is going to set some 2015 season records for Big Blue!"
NYGiants,38w8lq,CarlosFromPhilly,1 point,Sun Jun 7 17:09:05 2015 UTC,"I think Williams' biggest problem last year was patience. He attacked the ""hole"" without ever first looking for the hole or waiting for it to develop. I think he improves on that this year, big time.   Jennings is a savvy vet, he really picks his spots and is the exact opposite of Williams in that he almost waits too long sometimes. I think that he loses more snaps to Vereen than we all think at this moment. While Williams loses touches to both.  I think the numbers, towards the end of the year will be close, Jennings 750 with 3 TDs, Williams with 700 and 5 TDs, Vereen with about 350 yards and 5 TDs but all of them coming in the air or on 2rd and goal from the 5 on a draw type situations."
NYGiants,38w8lq,out_of_time,1 point,Sun Jun 7 20:28:29 2015 UTC,Jennings and Vereen easily. Williams is not in the conversation barring injury
NYGiants,38w8lq,noahruns,1 point,Sun Jun 7 23:23:57 2015 UTC,"Andre Williams is like Trent Richardson with lower expectations. He seems good, but isn't actually getting yards."
NYGiants,38w8lq,tootie,1 point,Sun Jun 7 23:41:42 2015 UTC,Jennings. He was third in the league in rushing yards last year before he got hurt. I think he'll have a big year as long as he's healthy.
NYGiants,38w8lq,RickSmith123,1 point,Mon Jun 8 01:19:56 2015 UTC,"I'm not expecting much out of either with the state of our line.  Hope they both work a lot on pass blocking.  That being said, this offense doesn't need a huge running game to be successful.  We are going to live and die on the health of OBJ, the comfort and consistency of Eli, and the ability of the line to pass block.  A decent running game and healthy Jennings would be great, but its not going to make or break the season imo."

NYGiants,38w8lq,yakoos,1 point,Wed Jun 10 04:34:54 2015 UTC,"If Williams can get into the second level without getting tripped up at the LoS, he becomes a weapon. There aren't many defensive backs that can square up and take him down when he has a full head of steam. Him getting passed the LoS depends on either his vision improving (which it naturally should) or better run blocking from the line, which we solidified by sliding Pugh in.  Jennings is our primary back still, but Williams should become a future Jacobs."
NYGiants,38w8lq,TheCowgirlCrusher,1 point,Sun Jun 7 14:13:39 2015 UTC,I definitely agree that Williams can be the next Jacobs. He has the power to mow over a defensive line when he has his momentum.
NYGiants,38sr7s,baseballallday,18,Sat Jun 6 14:26:48 2015 UTC,"He was invaluable to us with our safety situation. The best safety in the draft right when we needed to rebuild our safeties, and he was a leader on the best defensive college in the SEC. It was a knockout home run potential wise."
NYGiants,38sr7s,TheCowgirlCrusher,4,Sat Jun 6 14:52:27 2015 UTC,I just hope they did enough to patch up that O-Line. Gotta keep Eli on his feet this season.

NYGiants,38sr7s,DutchingtonNJ,6,Sat Jun 6 17:32:01 2015 UTC,"Doesn't mean that follows him to Washington. Could have been a scheme issue, or he just didn't like his situation in Tampa."
NYGiants,38sr7s,Sexterminator,0,Sat Jun 6 19:02:17 2015 UTC,"So he doesn't like doing his job so much that he purposely plays like garbage? Why would a player do that and decrease his value?  I understand scheme plays a huge part of how well he plays, but let's not pretend like he wasn't horrible the past two years. His coverage skills are almost non-existant, and he's extremely overpaid. I hope he turns his career around, but this seems like a kick the tires kind of move. Not a long term solution"
NYGiants,38sr7s,LeDudicus,7,Sat Jun 6 19:11:42 2015 UTC,"I did not say he was a long term solution. What I said was I would have liked my Skins to have drafted Collins, but they did not so I would settle for Goldson considering he is an upgrade to our Safety unit no matter how you slice it."
NYGiants,38sr7s,Rutawitz,4,Sat Jun 6 19:32:02 2015 UTC,"Yeah you guys had kind of a quiet offseason but sometimes those are the best offseasons. Took legitimate steps to improve the OL, Secondary, and STs units. Also, for as much as we shit on Perry Fewell here, I think him as a Secondary Coach is an underrated hire."
NYGiants,38sr7s,realdealdynasty,2,Sun Jun 7 00:50:56 2015 UTC,"Agreed, Fewell's overall defensive performance may have been asstacular, particularly in the front 7, but he developed Prince Amukamara into an excellent starting CB(even though he misused the fuck out of him) and the back end of the defense has been strong for years with Rolle back there."

NYGiants,38sr7s,DXGypsy,4,Sat Jun 6 16:21:36 2015 UTC,"Flowers may have been a reach at 9 but Reese made up for it with Collins. Overall, we addressed our two biggest needs with the first two picks so I can't complain. If Collins can show versatility and not just a ""in the box"" defender, he will be a steal. He will definitely have every opportunity to take over as the leader in the defensive backfield."
NYGiants,38sr7s,_newyorkgiants_,3,Sat Jun 6 15:25:52 2015 UTC,"Collins also has a tendency to get over-aggressive on plays and then get beat badly. He's a great tackler, and can get into the backfield, just needs to work on making better reads."
NYGiants,38sr7s,Sexterminator,2,Sat Jun 6 15:53:04 2015 UTC,I had bad feelings over the pick but every fan besides me seems happy with him so I'm trying to relax and think happy thoughts about him.
NYGiants,38sr7s,danfromeuphoria,3,Sun Jun 7 01:16:26 2015 UTC,"Best steal of the second round in my opinion, we basically got two first round picks."
NYGiants,38sr7s,cfl1,3,Sat Jun 6 21:25:50 2015 UTC,Him and Randy Gregory are both up there for sure
NYGiants,38sr7s,DutchingtonNJ,1 point,Sun Jun 7 00:52:57 2015 UTC,"Simply a tremendous steal. Not only are you getting a great player who has succeeded on the highest stage of the college game but you are getting a leader. The safety group is young - Cooper Taylor, Nat Berhe, Bennett Jackson, etc and Collins will establish himself as the leader of that group. Although a young man himself, Collins' passion and skill should help forge the group. This is much more than you would get for a Safety taken in later rounds."
NYGiants,38sr7s,bwsmg718,1 point,Mon Jun 8 16:17:42 2015 UTC,"I'm sure Collins will pile up tackles, which makes him big in fantasy.  But we have to hope that Cooper Taylor or someone else can stop the home-run balls that could cost us games."
NYGiants,38sdtx,JoeAllan,9,Sat Jun 6 11:58:13 2015 UTC,For players this is perfect. I honestly wouldn't change a thing. I wanna add a coach in there too but it's too hard to take any of those four players off.

NYGiants,38sdtx,_ShutThatBabyUp,2,Sat Jun 6 22:10:20 2015 UTC,Only if he agrees not to have sexual relations with his secretary.
NYGiants,38s3vv,xSxHxAxRxPx,22,Sat Jun 6 09:36:16 2015 UTC,I think the oline and refusing to move on to short passes to alleviate the pressure lost him his job.
NYGiants,38s3vv,TheCowgirlCrusher,14,Sat Jun 6 11:09:49 2015 UTC,"No. I'm also not sure OBJ would've broke out like he did. Not saying he isn't as talented as he has shown, just that Gilbride's offense is tough to pick up and heavily reliant on timing and the receivers and QB reading the defenses the same.   Overall it was the new offense that brought about Eli's resurgence, which in turn brought about our offensive resurgence as a whole."
NYGiants,38s3vv,theverybest27,1 point,Sat Jun 6 12:53:45 2015 UTC,Also given that Eli missed time early due to his ankle and OBJ missed time later in the summer/preseason that could have created more problems with timing between the two in that offense.  Then again I think both Eli and OBJ are pretty smart players and they did get on the same page in the WCO fairly quickly all things considering.
NYGiants,38s3vv,Engineers_Disasters,10,Sat Jun 6 19:27:56 2015 UTC,How would ODB save him when he calls a draw play on 3rd and 17 lol.
NYGiants,38s3vv,xenongamer4351,3,Sat Jun 6 14:02:57 2015 UTC,I just laughed and cried at the same time
NYGiants,38s3vv,spike1203,2,Sat Jun 6 21:27:23 2015 UTC,"I'm really glad you guys don't coach football.  Playing conservative on 3rd and long isn't a unique philosophy.  Eli has a the tendency to throw picks, and if Gilbride called a forced long ball every time and Eli got picked you'd still find a way to blame KG.  Let me guess, 3rd and longs were totally revolutionized under McAdoo.  1st down throws all the time."

NYGiants,38s3vv,xenongamer4351,3,Mon Jun 8 13:24:21 2015 UTC,I bet public opinion would have changed about him.  I've got a feeling ODB would have fit very well into Gilbrides scheme.  However the front office and Coughlin may have already had their mind made up well in advance.
NYGiants,38s3vv,MasterCronus,-11,Sat Jun 6 20:45:01 2015 UTC,Another stupid post by this guy. When will it stop
NYGiants,38ro8u,nyg1,7,Sat Jun 6 05:54:35 2015 UTC,"What specifically are they going to do across the board including coaching, practice techniques, training, nutrition, whatever, to lower injury rates? Or do they think the crazy injury rates are just dumb luck?"
NYGiants,38ro8u,Ghopper21,6,Sat Jun 6 13:10:50 2015 UTC,For Eli ask him if he's going to make another rap video.
NYGiants,38ro8u,_newyorkgiants_,9,Sat Jun 6 13:21:24 2015 UTC,"Just a few suggestions  For Eli: ""With the emergence of Odell Beckham Jr. as a rising star in the league, Victor Cruz returning, Ruben Randle showing an increase of production, what is looking to be a solid offensive line, and the second year in the system of Ben McAdoo do you strive to have your best statistical season yet? If you were to make a prediction of your end of the year statistics what would they be?""  Cruz: ""What has the most difficult part of the rehabilitation process been? With the hype surrounding Odell Beckham Jr do you feel pressured to perform and prove yourself once again?""  Coughlin: ""Problems surrounding the defense last year came from a lack of depth at a number of positions. How does the new defensive unit under Steve Spagnuolo plan to dissect such a problem? On the same token,  for the past 2 years statistics have shown the Giants ranking last in the NFL for injuries, and by a large margin. At what point does it turn from ""bad luck' to simply something is wrong with the training staff of this organization? It is clearly a determent to the success of this team, year in and year out.    Personally I would like my question for Tom Coughlin to be asked, Thanks!"
NYGiants,38ro8u,celestial_turtle,5,Sat Jun 6 10:59:08 2015 UTC,This question for Tom Coughlin is the most important. With losing players pretty much week in week out this needs to be addressed. Whether it's the training staff or something else the stability of our players will positively impact the feel of our season; I'm really curious how he will answer this. I'd love some feedback if you ask this!
NYGiants,38ro8u,chopsoffury,2,Sat Jun 6 14:54:41 2015 UTC,"He probably won't answer it in a way that we want, but it should draw more attention to the problem which may force Mara to step in."

NYGiants,38ro8u,spennell89,2,Sat Jun 6 13:33:31 2015 UTC,"But really though, maybe ask him to come do an AMA sometime!"
NYGiants,38ro8u,spennell89,2,Sat Jun 6 13:37:55 2015 UTC,"That would be awesome if he did an AMA! I would like to ask few questions regarding his injury, his success (being a super bowl champ and one of our best UDFA), and maybe the JPP hold out. The reason behind JPP hold out is he did the same thing a couple years back but eventually both came to an agreement.  OP- The question about his success I would like for him to answer the most. Thanks!"
NYGiants,38ro8u,Manning2Cruz,2,Sat Jun 6 18:20:36 2015 UTC,"I went and it was great! Pretty insightful and a lot of fun. Eli is HILARIOUS and had the room hysterical just about every time he spoke. Reese had some really neat things to say about how we trad ed up for Collins. Coughlin shut down any talk of a qb sneak, and Beason denied any involvement  with the infamous 7th crew song. Vic was laughed at by Eli when he claimed to be 5'11"". He and Diehl made little kids day when they scooped him up to bring him on stage, after seeing that he was upset that the time ran out before he could ask Vic a question.  Edit - also regarding us being the most injured team in the league: basically Reese said they are incorporating 5 or 6 new ""sports science"" metrics to help reduce injuries. Coughlin seemed a bit complacent to questions about it (not rude, just a little pithy) saying that injuries happen and we have to learn to move forward with them."

NYGiants,38ke0k,pee_diddy,7,Thu Jun 4 20:07:25 2015 UTC,"Relevant section:   ""Odell Beckham Jr., WR, New York Giants  In a way, this is my favorite entry on the entire list, because, like Steph, Beckham has a totally singular skill set, and I think we’re on the brink of him shattering any standard approach a defense would normally take. Even when you move past the ridiculous ball skills, Beckham is already among the best route runners in football. Few guys I’ve ever seen can do the type of damage he does all over the formation. He’s a force on in-breaking routes, he can torch corners on the outside, and he can win balls up high — all of that together shouldn’t be possible.  This is where I remind you that we haven’t even seen a full season of Beckham. And there are plenty of factors that point to Year 2 being even better than his rookie campaign. Even with left tackle William Beatty out for the beginning of the season, I expect the Giants line to be healthier and better than it was a year ago. Shane Vereen gives Eli Manning another quality pass-catching option. And Manning will have another full year in Ben McAdoo’s offense. Considering all of that, I don’t know if there’s any part of this season I’m more excited for than the weekly Odell Beckham show."""

NYGiants,38l1fz,misterTaco,9,Thu Jun 4 22:28:45 2015 UTC,There were a ton of circlejerky threads praising OBJ during the season and after he won OROY (deservedly so). Now we're in counter-jerk mode because people are sick of hearing about how great he is in every thread. It's also happening with JJ Watt. It's just part of the natural reddit popularity cycle and we'll be back to full-on OBJ jerk as the season starts up again.   People here are way too sensitive.

I personally think the reasonable range assuming his good health is something like 1200-1550 yards on like 130-150 targets. People undershooting 1k yards are hating or haven't watched him play...
NYGiants,38l1fz,Elided_Ego,2,Fri Jun 5 00:06:08 2015 UTC,"The offseason always gets like this. During the year, people say one thing, then around this time they get tired of constantly saying that thing and start saying the opposite. I've seen Titans and Raiders fan argue over which team was worse (they were both arguing for their own team btw) on /r/NFL during this time of year. Just ignore it because all logic goes out the window in the summer."
NYGiants,38l1fz,xenongamer4351,2,Fri Jun 5 02:51:11 2015 UTC,I don't see a bunch of hate. I think people are just trying to pump the brakes a bit. The hype has gotten completely out of hand.

We have people calling him the best WR in the game, predicting a HOF career.   ....much like you do in the rest of your post.

Even with his rookie numbers, he wasn't the in the best of 2014 discussion.  I haven't heard statements this silly though... While he does have the potential to be the best in the league from year to year, that is a left field comment if i've ever heard one.   He has to be the best before we can call him the best.     much like you do in the rest of your post. It's just a tad ridiculous to anoint him after 12 games played total in the NFL.       I'm not anointing him.  If we look at the numbers, everything I said was true.  He would be an exception to the rule if he didn't have a historic sophomore season.  Is it possible for him to slump?  Absolutely.   Is it likely based on historical examples?  If we stick to history, no.  It's not."

When the team does succeed, we are told it's a fluke. Our QB has answered the challenge multiple times and we are told he's an idiot. We are the only recent multi-year Super Bowl winning team since 2000 who doesn't have a national bandwagon fan base like the Pats, Steelers or Packers.  We have a lot to be bitter about when it comes to how NFL fans and talking heads treat our team."

NYGiants,38l1fz,EliTheGod,-2,Thu Jun 4 22:33:13 2015 UTC,"I am a NYG fan. There is no doubt in my mind about that.  But the speculation is justified at this time.  We have reason to worry in his hamstrings (Yes both, even if it seems the other one is the problem this time around), we have only 12 games to go on from last year, a shaky offensive line again cause of injuries. And there just isn't concrete proof at this time (Until pre-season or possibly even the season) saying he is 100% and will return to is rookie self.  And when he he enters his Sophmore year, there isn't again concrete proof he wont be like RG3 and do a complete flip, or be outstanding. So right now there is reason to hate on him, and reason to love him, just cant be overwhelmingly one or the other until the season starts and we see just how well him and the rest of the Giants perform..  Plus.... They just jealous they dont have OBJ on their team :)"
NYGiants,38l1fz,Lostmortal,3,Thu Jun 4 22:29:29 2015 UTC,"To be fair the rg3 situation was pretty unique in that anyone with eyes could tell rg3 was seriously injured and couldn't move at all, yet the Redskins kept sending him out there and watching his knee buckle, until it got absolutely shredded.  One of the worst mismanagements of a franchise type player (let alone one that cost 3 1sts) I've ever seen."
NYGiants,38l1fz,darkeagle91,1 point,Fri Jun 5 01:45:27 2015 UTC,"I disagree that its equally likely that he improves as it is that he regresses. When your talking about a rookie player, the assumption should be they will improve unless there is a distinct reason to think they should regress. These guys are professionals who work incredibly hard at their crafts. There is also a pretty steep learning curve to the NFL, so when sepne succeeds as if there is no learning curve (like Beckham, Donald or Martin did last year) it shows they are far ahead of their peers. The kinds of players that can do that typically are more polished and refined players than their peers coming into the NFL. There is essentially no reason to think that type of player would regress in the second year. If they have a change in coaching or off season legal problems/injuries then maybe you have a reason to think they will regress, but otherwise the assumption should be that they will improve.   Now when we talk about Beckham improving upon last year we have to consider that his pace over the last 6-8 games of the season would have been the best season any receiver ever had if he maintained it for 16 games. So its not really reasonable to expect his numbers to improve. In fact there are a lot of reasons to think that his volume will go down, so a reduction in volume stats is expected. That doesn't mean we won't see Beckham improve his game, bit just that the volume statistics might go down. I expect his efficiency stats to rise"

NYGiants,38gbhq,TheCowgirlCrusher,3,Thu Jun 4 13:23:22 2015 UTC,"It's hard to put guys like Taylor, Moss, Brown, et al up against one another.  They were so overwhelming in their respective positions... Football is such an incredibly team dependent sport, it's impossible to compare guys who were so good that they literally dominated the game completely on their own.    When you look at guys like Jordan, Curry, LeBron, you can immediately see what each person's limits are and it's a lot easier to compare them.  Their greatness comes from shooting, blocking, assists.  You can immediately see them in one on one or one on two situations and measure them against almost every opponent on the floor. But when you have players like LT who is playing behind-- depending on-- three offensive linemen, you have to wonder-- how would he have done as a DE in a 4-3?  How would he have done on the 89 Jets?  the 86 Bears?      I think you almost have to stick to positions or at the least side of the ball when comparing GOAT."

NYGiants,38gbhq,apreche,11,Thu Jun 4 03:28:26 2015 UTC,"When you hear the nickname “LT” the first name that should come to mind is Lawrence Taylor. There has been no player in NFL history that has changed the game quite like Lawrence Taylor. Coming into the draft, many GM’s claimed that he was the greatest college linebacker since Dick Butkus and knew he was going to take the NFL by storm. He had no prior injury concerns and luckily fell 2nd overall to the New York Giants. In his rookie year, the Giants knew they had a future hall of famer and was coined the name Superman on the practice field because nobody had seen pass rushing even close to as effective as LT’s. He would go on to be the first player in NFL history to win both the Rookie of the Year award and the Defensive Player of the Year award in the same season. LT’s skills were devastating and he became unstoppable blitzing the quarterback. Lawrence Taylor went 7 straight seasons with double digit sacks including 3 of those seasons winning the Defensive Player of the Year award, 2 of those winning the Superbowl and 1 of those winning the MVP. Even while testing positive multiple times for cocaine in his career, LT would help form “The Big Blue Wrecking Crew” which is widely known as the greatest line backing core in NFL history. Lawrence Taylor created such an impact at the OLB position that blocking schemes would be changed forever to account for the quarterbacks blindside. He is also the reason that the Left Tackle is one of the highest paid positions in the NFL because teams need to protect the Quarterbacks from animals like him. Not only is Lawrence Taylor the best linebacker in NFL history, but I also believe he might be the best player in NFL history"
