If its anything like the new gen hiluxs in Australia. Your gearbox/Tranny generally shit themselves at 60,000Kms.  Having a 4x4 thats robust, twin solid axes, can fix everything with a spanner, screwdriver and duct tape.. THATS PRACTICAL."

4x4,3dyv27,IrLoserBoy,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:36:55 2015 UTC,You say they'll last forever but we all just looked at op's link to a company that put in a ton of work to rebuild them and is selling them for a huge price. Any thing will 'last forever' when you put that kind of effort into it.
4x4,3dyv27,hoak,3,Tue Jul 21 01:53:56 2015 UTC,"Price reflects the condition. Plenty of older rust buckets still running. To be able fix it with spit,grease, and chicken wire is what makes it simple."
4x4,3dyv27,I_CUM_BACON,3,Tue Jul 21 03:46:30 2015 UTC,"Well you've got to remember that certain things start to fall apart after 30-50 years. Like everything rubber, paint, interiors, etc. The draw of these is their simplicity and nostalgia, not so much their reliability. They're not gonna be perfect all the time but they will be easy and (fairly) cheap to fix."
4x4,3dyv27,irish1185,6,Tue Jul 21 02:01:05 2015 UTC,"I have a 1978 Fj40.

They are awesome in their own right. Sure they lack all creature comforts, but driving one of them you focus on the drive. You hear the engine, feel the heat/vibration, and notice more about your surroundings. There are no distractions since you cannot hear a stereo or your phone, haha.   This is coming from a guy who has had other Toyotas: 1981 pickup, 1988 4runner, 1990 FJ62, and my current DD: 1999 Tacoma Xtra Cab. I love my Fj40 for what it is. I bought it when it was a pile and built it back up. The 60-series is also a great way to go. Both are ruggedly simple and surprisingly capable. The 80 is too soft for me and too big, also lacks the simplicity to fix easily in the field."

4x4,3dyv27,DeepSouthTJ,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:44:44 2015 UTC,IIRC the FJ40 is a good bit smaller and the top doors and windshield all come down/off. Basically set up pretty similar to a Jeep.
4x4,3dyv27,zigzaghd,-1,Mon Jul 20 20:47:21 2015 UTC,"IRW :    Hard to find parts. Hard to repair. Old motor technologies. Old suspension technologies. And Hard on fuel.   Over everything they are only copies of the original Jeep Willys.  The Wrangler have the same look, but a better motor, better suspension, very better MPG...."
4x4,3dyv27,Melburnian,3,Tue Jul 21 01:09:31 2015 UTC,"Better drivetrain and a lot bigger than a Willys.   Everything else you said is mostly true but thats not what collectable cars are about. A camry is faster than most 60/70s muscle cars but they dont have anywhere near the same experience.   A stock JK is heaps more capable than a stock FJ40, but no one is spending $50k on a FJ40 to smash rocks. Its all about the experience of travelling for the sake of it.   Parts for FJs and Series Land Rovers arent hard to get. You can get almost everything, people still make new panels."
4x4,3dyv27,irish1185,2,Tue Jul 21 09:14:36 2015 UTC,"The Wrangler have the same look, but a better motor, better suspension   Not to pick a fight on the internet. Here are my thoughts on the comparison.    Do you mean the JK? TJ? YJ? CJ? If you are talking the latter (CJ, and to some extent YJ) they have the same engine and the same suspension. Otherwise you are comparing apples to oranges. Sure a vehicle that was built last year has better MPG than one built 35 years ago. There are CAFE standards now that didn't exist when the CJ/Fj40/Willy were built.  If you are talking the Willys/MBs then the FJ40 is leaps and bounds in comfort, engine, and suspension above that. Not to mention finding Willys parts is a serious pain. Look at crash test videos from the first MBs. Four wheel independent suspension worked well for the fields of Europe, and beaches of Asia at slow speeds, but on US highways after the war they had a habit of launching passengers from vehicles over bumps at highway speed if they hit them just right.  As for ease of working on or hard to repair: have you trouble shooted electronics in a modern engine? Have you tried that on and an older engine? Its FAR easier to figure out what is wrong on an older engine. There tends to also be more space to work on them since the engine bay is not filled with other components, AC parts, power steering pulleys, emissions control equipment, etc."

4x4,3e0e96,BeerRunner77,3,Tue Jul 21 02:15:49 2015 UTC,"Personally I would disregard any 3.0 regardless of the deal. I've bought cars with ""the bad engine"" and it always ends the same for me, an expensive swap that's more problematic and expensive then if I would have just bought the one I wanted to begin with.

4x4,3e0e96,tranquil_lemur,3,Tue Jul 21 01:33:26 2015 UTC,For $1000 I wouldn't recommend it. The 3.0 v6 was notorious for blowing head gaskets and plus it's a 26 year old vehicle with a quarter million miles so it's bound to be problematic. Plus new rims and tires will run you at least $400 for new ones. Chances are it will end up being a money pit for you.
4x4,3e0e96,magichobo3,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:31:21 2015 UTC,That's what I was thinking but by the sounds of it it is running pretty well and being driven. It passed MA state inspection and it's fairly strict here so I think that's a good sign.

I view quads as a luxury item and while I agree that they are very fun, you can't really do all the things you can do in a truck. You can also use a truck for utility more than a quad.   Also personally I like being in a cab sitting on a seat and I prefer a steering wheel, so it's also personal preference"
4x4,3dz0sv,showmehomie,3,Mon Jul 20 19:10:02 2015 UTC,"Alright thanks for the advice.  I think will just stay with my truck.  Now that I think of it, it's like I could either spend thousands on a basic quad, or spend less and have a much more capable and powerful truck toy."
4x4,3dz0sv,MC_117,2,Tue Jul 21 03:01:03 2015 UTC,The only purpose Ive ever scene for quads is on farms for herding/fence repairs what not. Costs a fortune and exposed to weather with no storage. With a beater truck you can probably go most places a quad can as well.
4x4,3dz0sv,r9we290xnow,3,Mon Jul 20 22:34:05 2015 UTC,"Farmer here, quads are great. I have a honda fourtrax 300 2x4. Will run 60 mph. Has an insane amount of torque, will haul a trailer, or a tree. Small enough to chase cattle through the woods light enough not to sink in mud. 1500$ for it I've used it more then all my other vehicles combined. It will push a sprint car. If anyone has one I'd recommend swamp fox tires. Insane grip on everything . I prefer my four Wheeler for work as it has plastic body that can take a beating. Along with the fact at 400ish pounds I can pick up 3/4 of the Wheeler to move it /pull it out of a mud pit. Finally when it rolls on me I can jump to safety and flip it back over myself. Everything is cheaper on this thing than a truck. That being said we also have a identical one that is older 4x4, and a newer honda Rubicon 4x4. Both are great but not mine."

4x4,3dwbrt,soggysecret,2,Mon Jul 20 04:54:46 2015 UTC,The cheapest winch bumper for the 2nd gen xterra is Iirc the arb bumper at $950 so $1300 isn't that much comparatively. And it is kind of sad when the arb bumper is the cheapest option.
4x4,3dwbrt,DrChaosPHD,2,Mon Jul 20 17:29:05 2015 UTC,"I think it is a significant price jump if you think about the difference in fabrication; this is essentially a beefy prerunner bumper that they slapped some diamond plating on to look cool.

4x4,3dyy8y,StonedMasonry,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:40:25 2015 UTC,The extra weight both for the fuel economy which might not be that bad with my 33x12.5 tires and because the truck currently sits around  4000lbs The rv has a 6500lbs hitch on it and i don't want to be too close to that. I'm not sure how much vehicle haulers weigh. Having the extra length constantly there could be a pain in the ass. Plus the trailer needs insurance too so three vehicles worth of insurance.  I'm considering it now but it could be a pain.   I'm also considering selling my truck and buying a cheapo jeepo that can be flat towed more easily. Which makes me sad as she's my baby.  though the backing up with a trailer sounds better than not being able to reverse at all with a flat tow.  If you have any thoughts on all of this I would love to hear them as I'm pulling my hair out with options.
4x4,3dyy8y,SnuffThePunkz,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:55:36 2015 UTC,I'd always trailer over flat tow. Looked into renting a u-haul trailer? If you don't need it constantly I'd save you some headache.

4x4,3dwfpx,olfitz,3,Mon Jul 20 02:57:39 2015 UTC,"Yeah I carry the boards as bed extenders if I need them haha, also have recovery ropes and snatch blocks, I've learned all my offroading knowledge from jeep guys.   To mount the winch I have a front mounted receiver, like a trailer hitch. Then I have the winch on a harbor freight mount that goes into the receiver, the only thing that sucks is I have to carry and put it in the receiver (its about 85lbs) and then have to hook it up to the battery, I might but some quick connects though that would make it a lot easier."

4x4,3dw6e1,DragonsNightmare,2,Mon Jul 20 01:10:46 2015 UTC,I see the 2.5 comes with front control arms and the 6 comes with a lot of other stuff (they usually do) i would bet there is something different in the rear suspension/axle between year ranges and you are getting longer/bigger parts for back there as well with the 6 inch. I'm no expert but that is what I would assume.
4x4,3dw6e1,gen1lwb,2,Mon Jul 20 01:27:05 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the reply it means a lot, and I didn't think about axle or suspension differences. How would I be able to get the 6 inches of suspension lift I desire?"
4x4,3dw6e1,gen1lwb,3,Mon Jul 20 01:35:35 2015 UTC,"Okay i just thought of this. Call a chevy dealer and ask what the difference is and if that doesn't work call a junkyard they can cross parts so they may be able to help. You could do a body lift beyond that spacers, add a leaf, longer torsion bars. Look at some extreme offroad rigs and get some ideas for a custom build. If you get stuck I've talked to energy suspensions engineers while doing repairs on my monty they were very helpful with how to actually set up and level a suspension system during custom fabrication. I'm curious now so I'll be doing some research on your problem and try to help if I can. Be creative. Good luck"

4x4,3du3sl,moleman0401,7,Sun Jul 19 14:10:03 2015 UTC,The fan is just an aux cooling fan. If it's real hot where you live and you see the temp climbing you can click it on or its real useful just chugging through trails because you loose that airflow for cooling.

4x4,3du3sl,SgtBrowncoat,5,Mon Jul 20 04:23:24 2015 UTC,"If it is the only fan then what you have is a kill switch.  When entering a deep water crossing the fan can spray water all over the engine bay, or worse, act as a propeller and pull itself into the radiator.  Spinning fan blades hitting the radiator can chew it up and leave you stranded.  If there are two or more fans, then it is a secondary fan for additional cooling.  Either way, turn the fan off if the water is deep enough it get your bumper wet."

4x4,3dsimi,TrenchTownRocker,3,Sun Jul 19 01:05:33 2015 UTC,"Do you know if it is a D22 or D40?  If it is the D22 with a ZD30 (3.0l diesel), they can be troublesome. If it is the YD25 (2.5l diesel), they have some issues too, but a 2005 is pre-DPF, so any problems that do come up shouldn't be too bad. Look for it smoking at low revs with lot of throttle.  Given you are using £ for price, I am not overly sure what other vehicles in the class were sold there. All of the Japanese makes of these utes of similar vintage are good, very reliable vehicles, although of the Japanese makes I'd put this generation of Navaras near the bottom of the reliability list. Also this generation of utes definitely aren't as nice to drive as the more recent ones.  If you are looking for simple reliability, a Ford Courier/Mazda B-Series, Hilux (the 1KD powered ones are probably the nicest of this generation vehicles) or Isuzu/GM Pickup would be your best bet."
4x4,3dsimi,Flys_Lo,3,Sun Jul 19 04:05:42 2015 UTC,UK only got the yd25.   D22 versions were vp44 injection pump and had issues with single row timing chains wearing out and oil pump pickups that didn't seal and caused crank wear.  Edit: I'm not 100% sure about the single row timing chain. That may be the d40 issue.
4x4,3dsimi,Kiwibaconator,2,Sun Jul 19 04:45:56 2015 UTC,It's a D22 with a 2.5l diesel engine 2005. The original engine shot a conrod through the block and has been replaced. The seller claims the replacement engine has had some sort of kit added which stops this sort of damage happening again. Checked on google - i think the kit has something to do with replacing faulty bolts on the conrod bearings.  I am in the UK. I am looking for something that can be comfortable enough to also use as a family car. Any suggestions?
4x4,3dsimi,Flys_Lo,3,Sun Jul 19 22:22:37 2015 UTC,"I personally would avoid the D22 if looking for a family car, particularly one with stories like that. They are very cramped inside. The Mazda/Ford and Isuzu GM's are better vehicles. The Hilux is the best of that era (again, if you get the 05+ with the 1KD engine, I would avoid the ones prior to that), but if resale values are like they are over here, you pay for it."
4x4,3dsimi,deprivedchild,2,Sun Jul 19 23:17:15 2015 UTC,"Add on question if you guys don't mind: What about the gas versions of the D22? IIRC in the U.S. where I'm based, they were available with the KA24 4 pot, and a VG33 N/A or supercharged."

4x4,3dqnvy,discretion,3,Sat Jul 18 14:53:32 2015 UTC,"Sounds to me like it's locked in 4H. Try dropping it, engaging 2H and drive forwards/backwards, maybe go round a corner or two. Probably just jammed up in 4H and needs some encouragement.   If that doesn't work for you and you're set on changing the CVs, you should be able to disconnect the front prop shaft at the transfer case, which will allow the wheels to spin freely (if it truly is stuck in 4H)"
4x4,3dqnvy,BigBlueRam,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:19:25 2015 UTC,"The more I played with it the more I leaned towards the same conclusion as you. At low speed turns, the wheel lopes a bit, making the steering wheel jerky back and forth. I've changed in and out of 4H and 4L a number of times, driven it forwards and back, no change. I'm still pretty sure the CVs are bad because of the click while turning, so that and the UBJs are still on the to do list. My guy at Advance says there's a solenoid on the transfer case that may be bad. Since the 4wd dash light is off when the lever is at 2H, does that mean it's not the solenoid? Being an electrical component, that's where I'd bet on the sensor living."
4x4,3dqnvy,BigBlueRam,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:46:45 2015 UTC,"This does sound an awful lot like a solenoid issue. I couldn't put my finger on it before, but I'd bet that's what it is. I had the same issue with an old Mazda pickup, the only difference is that mine was stuck in 2H and wouldn't engage into 4H.   The dash light, unfortunately, probably just reads whatever your 4H/2H shift lever tells it, it'll probably light up regardless of whether or not the solenoid is blown. That has been my experience, anyway. I'd get that solenoid checked, or if it's really cheap, just throw a new one in."
4x4,3dqnvy,BigBlueRam,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:30:07 2015 UTC,"That's what you would think, but the light stays on for about 10' in 2H coming out of 4H, so I'm not sure it's linked to the lever. Doesn't mean it's on the solenoid, or that the circuit isn't just reading it as 2H when it's not and has mechanically failed!"
4x4,3dqnvy,BigBlueRam,1 point,Sat Jul 18 19:33:06 2015 UTC,Also it's worth mentioning that I've probably been driving around the city like this for 2 weeks around town and maybe 30 minutes on the highways.
4x4,3dqnvy,MaxDerps,2,Sat Jul 18 18:15:31 2015 UTC,"Ah, this is falling together (in my mind, anyway). If the solenoid blew 2 weeks ago, leaving the transfer case locked in 4H, that would likely be why the CV joints have gone."
4x4,3dqnvy,MaxDerps,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:35:38 2015 UTC,"My Chiltons doesn't mention the solenoid, is this something that's internal and would be replaced in a rebuild? Probably cheaper to just buy a new transfer case at that point...  What if I drop the front drive shaft and drive around like that from now on? Obviously it's 2wd all the time now, but at least it won't grenade the dif and cook the axles. This is a daily driver 90% of the time and is going on a road trip in 6 weeks for my wedding anniversary..."
4x4,3dqnvy,92PathSE,1 point,Sat Jul 18 20:07:32 2015 UTC,"That's not a bad idea. If you pull the front prop shaft and leave it out til you can get her fixed, you should be fine. I'm no mechanic but that's what I would do.  From what I know about tranny/transfer case solenoids, they're supposed to be easily accessible. They fail often enough, I'd hope the manufacturer put them in a good spot."
4x4,3dqnvy,92PathSE,2,Sat Jul 18 20:45:09 2015 UTC,Does your transfercase diff lock when in 4H? Driving on pavement with a centre locked diff is a quick way to cook your shafts

Cheap to buy, good offroad and quite reliable, the owner had no problems with it but the consensus seemed to be that after 100k drivetrain issues became more common, as well as rust (over here, at least). Not too sure about whether Jeep have improved or not but I can promise you it'll be more reliable than the Discovery, which is good off-road and super cheap but you should only consider buying if you have lots of disposable income for repairs and a plentiful supply of junked Discoveries to cannibalize (like the UK does).

4x4,3dl75v,4x4newby,9,Fri Jul 17 04:12:11 2015 UTC,"Turning will be impaired slightly, but nothing to worry about. With the centre diff locked, you need to be on loose surfaces, otherwise after doing some turns things will start twisting and grinding until something shears. By having the centre diff locked on a loose surface the tyres can slip and release any of this wind-up before things break.  L gear in a Toyota auto just means hold in 1st gear, no higher.  It may help to select PWR for the extra torque at higher RPMs, but there is no real need to do it.  Locking the centre diff does more or less the same thing as selecting 4WD in a part-time 4WD (Jeep Wrangler, Landcruiser 105, 70 etc).  Further explanation:  You've got two gearboxes in your car. Straight from the engine is 5 speeds and a reverse. This is identical to a normal car. You've also got a two-speed gearbox behind that gearbox. You leave it in high-range for normal use, but when in technical off-road situations you can switch it to low range for extra torque.  You've got three diffs - one in the front axle (locking this, if available, will severely limit steering), and one in the rear axle, and one inbetween the two axles (the centre diff).  The power goes from the transfer case to the centre differential. A differential provides power to the side with the LEAST resistance, which is why when you lift a wheel on an unlocked axle that wheel will spin and you've got no power to the one that is still in contact with the ground.  Locking this centre differential will provide a guaranteed 50% torque to both the front and rear axle. When driving on a hard-packed surface, both axles follow different paths when going around corners. As one axle needs to cover less distance than the other, but can't because of the 4WD system providing 50% of torque at all times, the wheels need to slip to avoid winding up. Obviously this slippage cannot occur on a hard packed road. It is also why it is safe (but not recommended) to use locked-centre 4WD on a straight bit of sealed road."

4x4,3dl75v,Kiriesh,3,Fri Jul 17 17:57:45 2015 UTC,"Drive is drive. Your gearbox functions normally, select the best gear to be in for your speed and situation. L usually locks it into 1st gear. This is completely unrelated to whether you're in 4WD or 2WD."

The only time that they're ""ok""  is in snow and rain, the rest of the time they feel like open differentials. My buddy had one in his 4runner, he'd get on a off camber section and start spinning one tire in the front and rear just like he had open diffs.   For the rear I'd get a Detroit locker, grizzly locker or ARB. You won't even realize it's there when you're driving on the street. Lunchbox lockers work fine but they often make a clicking sound when you turn corners on the street.   You'll get way more performance out of a rear locker and open front than you would from a rear LSD and locked front. So I'd spend your budget on a nice rear locker.   You also need to consider drive train strength as well. What size engine, tires and gears are you running on what axles? Depending on how you 'wheel, adding a locker is going to cause you breakage if you don't make other upgrades to your drive train.   All that said, lockers are the shit and you'll be blown away by how much more you can do once you're locked up. Lockers really take it to the next level."

Think about dragsters, front wheel drive dragsters can only go so fast because under acceleration the weight all shifts to the back tires. Rear wheel drive dragsters have far more traction for the same reason. It's all about leverage. A rear locker is exponentially more effective than a front one.   A grizzly or detroit locker in the rear would be completely invisible."
4x4,3dh99q,Eat_sleep_poop,1 point,Fri Jul 17 03:51:23 2015 UTC,"Drag racing and wheeling are completely unrelated. You will always have better traction out because of physics (which makes the case to NOT have a locker back there because of the ""natural"" traction you get with weight transfer to the rear tires), but you NEED the locker up front. I've driven with selectables front and rear and have rarely is the rear locker making or breaking getting over an obstacle. Sure, it no doubt helps but the front will always pull you over. Think... It is easier to push a wagon of rocks up a hill or pull it? Why try and muscle nearly 100% of the vehicle weight on the OPPOSITE side of your traction device? It is much easier to have grip in the beginning of the vehicle, and constantly keep that grip, rather than push dead weight.  Also, any auto locker in the rear is never invisible. It is not a nuisance (most of the time) but you always know it's there. I can tell you have never had one."

We had reached a point of no return so we pushed on and came to a small but steep incline which was quite muddy and had deep ruts.  I was rather inexperienced at this point and so it looked like staying out of the ruts was going to be the wisest move.  I drove forward to the left of the ruts but quickly lost traction and the car started to go further left on a downward slope (and the causeway behind us).  I braked and asked my mate to spot me while I reversed back to get in a better position.  Neither of us realised the bad angle that my landcruiser was on but thankfully he noticed I was about to go over the edge of the causeway, in fact the rear left wheel was hanging off.  I stopped just in time and we strapped a winch extension strap to the bull bar and around a big tree, so the car wouldn't go any further.  Got everyone out of the car and we spent the next 2-3 hours digging a path for the car to go back into the ruts.  It was so slippery on the hard clay that we just couldn't get any traction.  Our wives were in the other car behind us with all the kids going crazy.  My mate's wife decided to call the State Emergency Service in the hope that they would rescue us.  Turns out we were pretty close to the end but had to go through private property to climb out.  They sent two fire trucks with 6 guys to come and find us.  We managed to find the way out and made it up onto someone's property.  It was an asphalt road so I thought it was public but after walking about 100m I realised it was someone's property.  I walked to the end (took about 10 mins) and came to a big ass wrought iron gate, this was some serious medieval shit with a giant padlock on it.  The fire crews were on the other side of it!  They got out their pneumatic bolt cutter and got the lock off then sent the trucks down to pickup the others.  We organised a lift home and left our cars there for the night (it had started to go dark just after we got out of there).  I posted in the forum on the website that I found the track on, explaining the situation and asking for help.  I got a quick reply and next thing I knew it had 4 serious 4wd's ready to come out the next day for a rescue mission.  They got us out relatively easily and we had a great time doing it.  I am forever thankful for their help!  There's some damn nice people out there!  TL;DR Tried avoiding ruts, ended up almost going over a 3m drop, lots of kids with us, had to get rescued, some awesome dudes helped to get the cars out the next day."

The Nissan 4.2 is far better, but quite rare to find a good one in a good vehicle at that budget.  Get a Landcruiser 2H, or 1HZ - both far more tractor-like engines, but as long as you're patient on hills will serve you better in the long run. A rust-free 61 series with the 12H-T 4.0 DI turbodiesel is also a possibility, but once again towards the top end of your budget.  If you can afford a 1HD-T (as long as the big end bearings have been replaced) or 1HD-FT you'll be laughing although you probably will have trouble finding a reasonable one at that budget.  EDIT: some more thoughts:  If you want to use it for camping to central queensland, you'll want a decent fuel range. The off-road capabilities will not be tested significantly, so a stock or almost stock (apart from suspension/tyres) will suit fine.  You'll want some level and comfort for those distances, and seeing as you're looking at Patrols something like a Troopy would not suit your needs despite being an excellent touring machine. An 80 series is your ideal Landcruiser, in 1HZ diesel.  I hate them, mostly because of their image, but have you considered a dual-cab ute with canopy? A 1KZ Hilux is a very plain, but very functional choice.  The Mitsubishi Pajero does not come to the top of /r/4x4 's mind, but if you're using it to access camping spots instead of really offroading it, or abusing it day-in, day-out it is a fine (albeit slightly dorky looking) choice. With some decent tyres you'll be surprised where they'll take you. They're supremely comfortable on-road and on corrugations, really quite reliable (if a little underpowered, although if you're talking Diesel 4WDs in your budget you'll have to get used to that), have a good load bay and are excellent around town."
4x4,3dda2z,BiasedBIOS,4,Wed Jul 15 13:09:56 2015 UTC,"Definitely.  It is pretty much a miracle that an early (pre-2004) ZD30 Patrol has reached 370k without at least one new engine.  OP, Google ""Nissan hand grenade"" and read up.  I would also add that if camping (rather than the tougher tracks) is your intention, you might want to look at a ute rather than a wagon.

If you are mechanically minded, try an auction. Not sure if a ex-mining vehicle would be worth the trouble.   I have a ZD30DDti 2007 Patrol. The only real issue I have with it is that low end is non-existent. Need the turbo for the torque. But I couldn't justify a 76 series in which I would be buying just for the engine. If the engine goes in the patrol, I'll be getting a 4.2L engine to throw in.   Just a minor inconvenience is that it is huge to be a daily driver. Turning radius is about the same as USS Washington and takes up the parking bay, edge to edge."

It has a terrible approach angle, unacceptable rampover angle, poor ground clearance, and is not particularly well constructed.  The Hilux is much better, although if it is going to be really used then it needs some help with larger tyres and suspension. By the sounds of it though a stock one will suit your needs fine. 75L fuel tank is quite limiting though.  Don't bother with the specs on the bit of paper - if it looks low, it is.  Fortunately, unlike a lot of 70 series or single-cab patrols, quite a lot have been in private hands so you shouldn't have too much hassle finding a decent dual-cab for the right price.

Fit an egt gauge and drive to safe limits and you won't have a problem.    The meltdowns are caused by how they are driven in combination with the factory tune being too hot.   The way I see it is a uni student shouldn't be looking at any vehicle they can't afford the repairs on. Which to be frank is most 4x4's."
4x4,3dda2z,BiasedBIOS,1 point,Sat Jul 18 07:57:00 2015 UTC,"ZD30 at 390,000km though is waiting to die, no matter how its tuned or been looked after. Same with any modern diesels of its vintage.  The TD42, 2H & 1HZs (all manual, driven reasonably well but not hard) I've experienced have burnt fuel at 12.5-13L/100km all day, no more, no less. Add 2L/100km for towing 1.5T.

Obviously this is the exception to the rule, but a lot of both 2Hs & 1HZs reach 750,000 without thinking about it as long as they've been cared for. I also have it on very good authority of an original 1HZ with 1,200,000 so far, although I haven't seen it in the flesh."

But it's an artificial situation as noone else uses a vehicle that way.   The problem with both those engines is overheating as the idi heads put a lot of the heat from your burning fuel straight into the cooling system.  people who turbocharge them to try and out accelerate bicycles find they can't keep them cool and also have piston problems when running tunes that wouldn't hurt any other engine.   Even the oil change interval for those idi engines is a problem for a student.  My direct injection engine from 85 was running 16,000km intervals.  I'd take the zd30 over both those engines every time.   All four of my diesels are direct injection."

I own a diesel Jeep Cherokee that's a tonne lighter and even it struggles sometimes while off-road with a 2.8L.   As someone who is also at uni, I know about budgeting. Remember that you want a car that's decent on road, too. There's nothing worse than trying to park a land barge in the uni car park every day. I used to own a GQ Patrol. Got so sick of the fuel costs and trying to park the damn thing I sold it and bought a KJ Jeep instead. I'm a girl, though, so maybe it's just my parking skills. 😜   Anyway, I'd go for something ever so slightly smaller. Perhaps a Pajero, or a mid 2000s Hilux ute. Or even a Land Rover Disco. All great cars, all reliable when you pick the right engine, and parts are cheap. Whatever you do, stay away from a workhorse like a troopy. Great cars, but real bone rattlers on the tarmac."

Just make sure you go online beforehand and check what to look for when you're buying that particular model. Each car has its own quirks and sometimes something really small like steering wheel shimmy can be an indicator of a much larger problem.

Unless its had a full reconstruction in the last 100,000kms or so i would stay away.   If your going for a full size 4wd your gonna be paying alot in fuel anyways so i would suggest a diesel 80/105 series crusier (which you can pick up with a few little mods and less kms for around the 7,000-9,000 grand mark.

4x4,3dda2z,sparky7720,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:58:29 2015 UTC,"Yeah I'd steer clear of that patrol. It's liable to have some issues, I own the later model version and I'm still praying they got things right. Avoid anything petrol, it's more a preference thing, but also if you're out west or up the tip petrol can be more expensive by a significant amount, and they also have issues with water.  Any of the landcruisers would be a go. If you're looking for a wagon, 80 series all the way, coil overs all round, decent solid truck with no real consistent issues. If it's a Ute, stick to anything after 95-96. The HJ75 is a great engine, but they had a piece of crap rear end. Half axles always shooting out. The later model ones used a larger stud to keep the axle in. The best thing with landcruiser is with a 10mm 17 and 14mm spanner and a half decent knowledge, you can fix nearly every component on it, so it's handy for keeping service costs down."

I saw someone post something on facebook earlier this week (from a run this weekend) with a JKU with 35s, or best I could guess somewhere in that range- and the water looked to almost go to the top.   Now, back in the day Coney Flats was the harder of the two trails (see FunTreks book), I've noticed over the last 10 years or so that MSV has become increasingly tough- mostly just after the hairpin turn near the end of the trail. The few crossings on the way up are not that big of a deal, and there is really only one section with a big boulder that you've got to pay attention to, but once you make that left hand hairpin, it gets much more interesting. Granted- I'm on 32s so that makes my tire placement more important, but everytime I find myself really using the skids and sliders, and for the last 4 years I've gone up every year it gets just a little bit rougher."

I've done it in bone stock TJs (open/open) in the past and I didn't see any changes that would exclude such a rig these days. You'll have to pick your line carefully with open diffs on the one big rock obstacle on MSV and again at the mini rock garden on CF. Otherwise, it's a cakewalk."

I haven't done the section that starts in Camp Dick in a long time - I prefer to start at the Bunce School side, then head up and around the Ironclads loop and come back out at Bunce School again. There's a couple fun spots on Ironclads, but the whole thing will feel mild compared to MSV/Coney Flats. It's also a much shorter trail. I've done Bunce several times after work, whereas MSV/CF can be a full day trip.  Different story in winter, though. Bunce is a hoot with a few feet of snow."

This was in Tucson, the dealership was Precision Toyota, and they were in need of a part that I could not provide for at least six weeks (Yes, you can access non-USA LC parts via Ontario, CA, but it takes a little know how). Well anyways, they just came out of Mexico, and they told me they trekked all the way up from the tip of Argentina. I'm not certain where exactly they were heading, but they told me they were going North. I was under the impression  they were traveling from tip to tip.   I remember when my co-worker called me up to the front counter to help them out, and  I had no idea what I was in for, thought it was just another Cruiser. I wish I could remember the part they were in need of, but it was so long ago. When I went out to the parking lot to further inspect I was taken aback at how large the 70 troopy was; it made my 60 seem tiny. Cool couple, at the time I thought they were German based on their accents, and how awesome it was they were for making  such a journey. I only dreamed of doing such a thing. The world was a safer place back then.  Thanks for this post, it brought back memories, and I doubt it's the same couple, it was almost 20 years ago. But cool regardless."

4x4,3dbijs,roadrash1992,6,Wed Jul 15 01:30:00 2015 UTC,"That V8 is a great engine. Keep an eye on the transmission, there was a problem with the bell housing, iirc, that could lead to 3rd and 4th going out.   The 4x4 on that truck is awesome and if you've got the Z71 package (I'd lookup the VIN, tbh) you have an insane amount of suspension travel.   If the stock radio is still there, be careful with the radio buttons, they fall off/break ridiculously easy.   Uh, oh, if you're having heat problems, like no heat, it's likely that the heater core is clogged. It's a pain in the ass to fix, but if you're cold enough it's worth it.

The only thing that really sucks is general maintenance. Expect the spark plugs to take longer than you think. That engine sits low and back, so the last 2 spark plugs will give you a run for your money.   Oh, I would get a bottle jack with an axle cradle or buy a cradle to fit over the top of the stock bottle jack. Trying to change the tires by jacking up the frame will just piss you off and tire (heh) you out.  If you have any questions feel free to PM me. I'm pretty sure I told you every thing I've dealt with on my dad's rig.   If you don't have dual exhaust, I would look into getting a Flowmaster system.

Had to borrow another jack from a Kia because I decided to lift the truck by the frame in a grocery store parking lot after puncturing a tire on the trail and not noticing for 10 miles.  I have a '98 Z71 and the suspension travel is sufficient. Front end travel is nothing to write home about, and half-ton front differentials (AAM 8.25"" IFS) are not lockable.  Z71 rear ends often come with the Eaton G80 Automatic locking differential, ""Gov-bomb"".

They have very little ground clearance, and the skid is plastic.  Take your front air damn off, that will help with entry angle. Make sure you don't have a stinger (trailer hitch) in. Mild trails with moderate rutting I'd say go for it. Make sure you have recovery gear and go with a buddy just to be safe.

4x4,3dblib,saltydeed,2,Wed Jul 15 00:26:26 2015 UTC,"Whatever you do, do not put a lumpy/lopey cam in it... you will have trouble with low end torque.  It'll sound cool but it will be a dog with horrendous gas mileage.  Stick with an RV (low RPM) cam.  RV cams are known for torque and fuel economy.  A college budget?  You're gonna be lucky to spend less than $3000 on a complete rebuild.  (new gaskets, seals, crank bearings, rod bearings, piston rings, water pump, etc.  It all adds up real fast, regardless of what brand engine it is)  If you can afford it, buy a hydraulic roller cam, it gives a little more power and torque than a comparable hydraulic flat tappet cam in the same powerband, and can give slightly better gas mileage as well.  Go with aluminum heads if you can afford it, and be sure to use ARP head bolts if you use aluminum heads.    Do not expect more than 4500-5500 RPM out of this engine.  Cam: Flat tappet... http://www.summitracing.com/parts/cca-sk35-231-3/overview/make/ford         Roller cam... http://www.summitracing.com/parts/hrs-cl220225-12/overview/make/ford  Heads:  Flat tappet... http://www.summitracing.com/parts/edl-5023/overview/make/ford  These are sold as a pair of heads...

Intake:  http://www.summitracing.com/parts/edl-2181/overview/make/ford  Carb:  http://www.summitracing.com/parts/hly-0-93670 or for fuel efficiency, pick this one and use an adapter... http://www.summitracing.com/parts/hly-0-4412c  Heads are where you make your power and efficiency... too big of an intake runner will kill low rpm get up and go, which is what you want in a 4x4.  160cc to 180cc is what I would stick with.  Not sure what your compression, hp, and torque would be as of yet, I would have to run the numbers through my desktop dyno, which gets a rough estimate of hp and torque.  Better thing to do is find a low mileage 351W... the lower the better, and just do the top end and cam on it.  Best thing to do is keep driving your 302 until it dies, by that time... you'll have enough money to build a 347 that puts out 400+ hp.    Or if you're thinking about roasting all four tires in 4x4 on flat pavement, think about a 427 Clevor... that will run you around 15 grand to build but would put out in excess of 650 hp.

That is with small tube headers, mufflers, and a 500 cfm two barrel carb.  Numbers for the roller cam are 450 ft lbs of torque and 370 hp.  Small tube headers, mufflers, and 500 cfm two barrel carb.  In either set up, you should be happy with the output."

4x4,3dblib,DrunkenMechanic,1 point,Sat Jul 18 08:01:37 2015 UTC,"350 at least at the wheels might be a bit much for a college tight budget.  My suggestion would be to get a newer efi 351 as it will be a roller motor. Try and shoot for something with 150k and under and pull a valve cover to check it out at least first. Since you have a working motor already I would hold out for a good deal on one. Then tear it down and inspect everything and figure out what it needs. you might get lucky and just need to hone it and throw new bearings/rings in it. Id lap the valves its cheap and easy to do, you can probably rent the tool to take the springs out for free. Inspect the heads thoroughly guides seats and look for any cracks. Most likely you can just lap them and throw new valve guide seals on and be good to go. If you feel ballsy do research on porting the bowls out on the heads and do that. Don't hog the ports out huge just real simple bowl work and pick up a couple hp for not too much money but you could fuck up the valve guides or valve seats. Do your research if you plan to do that. If you just hop in with no experience you will fuck it up. I'm just throwing it out there as a cheap way to make a few hp. You might be able to shave the egr bumps in the exhaust ports as well but you need to see what heads you have and do your research once again before you do that. Then Id do some headers intake and pick the proper cam for your needs/combo. You really probably want to shoot for down low torque. Dual plane manifold for sure probably a low rise. Eddy performer or something similar. The cam is another part you want to research to death. Too big of a cam and you wont have anything down low. Picking camshafts is really an art form. So in short my advice is get a nice roller motor to start with hopefully not have to do much machine work, then do intake/exhaust/cam and maybe do very minor port work if you feel you could do it. You can pull that off for cheap maybe 1000 if you get good deals on everything. Probably closer to 2000 though.   What is your 302 even? stock flat tappet 302 with a 2 barrel is a turd. roller 351 with minor mods will feel like a race engine in comparison."

They are line of site so the range won't be good in valleys or thick woods. Make sure you buy a good antenna and cable and mount it good. Don't fuck around with magnetic antennaes. Also mount the antenna with a spring so it will bend back if you go in a parking garage or branches or what not.

They were using CBs and when we got a little split up, I broadcasted on the ham. My buddy realized how far I was and how clear he could hear me. He started telling everyone that he was going to get his license because it was on a whole nother level. He threw my radio into another friends 4x4 and they took turns holding onto it and listening to how much clearer my broadcast was than on the CB. You can't just tell them, show them."

I prefer to stick to the older hiluxes and cruisers, but there's a huge export market here where they buy them to ship to Libya, Afghanistan, etc. They pay for even bad condition ones and it has decimated the used market and pumped the price of what's left. When this one goes, i'll be getting one of the newer models, I guess. I'd love a crewcab like yours, hardly any of them made it over here. They were more or less all doublecab."

4x4,3d6w8y,_dtch,2,Tue Jul 14 00:08:38 2015 UTC,"If memory serves, the front ends were wider by 1.5"" on either side. 1"" spacers should get you close enough.   Also, the reason they did this was to decrease the turning radius, since the narrower rear end would track tighter than an equally sized rear end. Since the General's truck turning radii blow universally across the board, I'd advise leaving it, especially if you wheel it."
4x4,3d6w8y,-Thunderbear-,1 point,Tue Jul 14 01:36:52 2015 UTC,I don't plan on a lot of wheeling. The reason for wanting to space out the rears is because I do a lot of highway driving and I keep getting thrown in and out of the ruts.
4x4,3d6w8y,Gnarnar,2,Tue Jul 14 01:40:30 2015 UTC,Wheel spacers are not the best if you're doing a lot of highway driving.

4x4,3d80sb,Kiwibaconator,1 point,Tue Jul 14 11:29:38 2015 UTC,"I guess bottoming out damages internals, what about full extension? Does it break internals too or worst case scenario the weld breaks and everything rips out?"
4x4,3d80sb,Kiwibaconator,2,Wed Jul 15 01:42:54 2015 UTC,Full extension doesn't break anything as long as the rebound damping matches the load and the springs get close to zero preload as the shock tops-out.  If there is a mismatch in rebound damping the shock can hit full extension with significant speed and that can damage not only the shock but it's mountings.
4x4,3d80sb,Kiwibaconator,1 point,Wed Jul 15 02:45:07 2015 UTC,But since these conditions will be at low speeds I assume the risk of such things are minimal?

4x4,3d4llf,1makfly,6,Mon Jul 13 14:03:31 2015 UTC,They think it was a shackle connected to a towball. Not a rated recovery point. The shackle hit him in the head.
4x4,3d4llf,viddles,2,Mon Jul 13 18:25:11 2015 UTC,"I never understood the reasoning for this... laziness I guess.   The end of a strap fits in the receiver, and then put the pin back in like normal.   Of course it's not ideal but it's a lot less likely to kill someone."
4x4,3d4llf,Gatodeocho,2,Mon Jul 13 22:08:38 2015 UTC,No no no.   The pins don't have enough strength when used that way. They need a block in the receiver to load the pin in double shear.
4x4,3d4llf,Kiwibaconator,1 point,Tue Jul 14 11:32:02 2015 UTC,"Let me clarify, I absolutely do not advocate this as an acceptable recovery practice. I have a winch with synthetic line, multiple shackle mounts front and rear, and zero hooks on my straps or anything else I'll ever be involved with.   All I'm saying is if you're out there like these guys and all you brought is a hitch and a strap, it might get you by.   Worst case the pin will bend and you cut it out when you get home. Maybe it even snaps in half, and the strap comes out with nothing attached to it and dents a panel. If there's no hunk of steel it won't kill anyone."
4x4,3d4llf,Gatodeocho,0,Tue Jul 14 14:39:29 2015 UTC,"Got to be careful with the pins, they don't always hold up to that abuse.  Especially the type that clips around a groove in the pin instead of the through-hole types.  A grade 8 nut/bolt combo with washers would be best if using the hitch for recovery."
4x4,3d4llf,McSnarkson,1 point,Mon Jul 13 22:40:01 2015 UTC,No no no.   Never load bolt threads in shear like that. It has to be a pin without threads.
4x4,3d4llf,Kiwibaconator,1 point,Tue Jul 14 11:32:49 2015 UTC,"Might I ask why?  Personally, I've never seen a pin or bolt let go.  I have seen the pins with the groove going around push the clip off.  Genuinely curious here."
4x4,3d4llf,McSnarkson,1 point,Wed Jul 15 01:24:18 2015 UTC,"Because the root of the bolt threads not only directly weakens the bolt (smaller remaining diameter), but it also is a stress riser which greatly increases the stress at the surface and causes cracks to start.  Things go wrong and the bolt shears in half suddenly."
4x4,3d4llf,Kiwibaconator,1 point,Wed Jul 15 02:46:48 2015 UTC,Or a hook that mounts in the receiver instead of a tow ball.
4x4,3d4llf,raevnos,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:56:32 2015 UTC,"Sure, but you're expecting people who would use a ball as a recovery point to carry the necessary hardware?  The pin's already in there. Unless it's a bumper mounted ball, then they deserve whatever happens if they use it.   Hell even a shackle in the ball mount would be better."
4x4,3d4llf,Gatodeocho,5,Mon Jul 13 23:19:57 2015 UTC,And this is why I tell my family member to not go 4wding until you buy rated recovery points. OEM tow hooks don't count.

4x4,3d22ld,UnDweeber,11,Sun Jul 12 22:10:10 2015 UTC,"Because it has traction control - which means that when a wheel loses traction they will brake that wheel, redirecting the torque to the wheels that do have traction.  Works surprisingly well - without the disadvantage of difficult steering you have when difflocks are engaged."
4x4,3d22ld,Flys_Lo,3,Sun Jul 12 22:51:52 2015 UTC,so a regular live axle will transfer torque if opposite wheel is stopped with breaks? I though that only worked with torsen diffs like in range rover
4x4,3d22ld,Flys_Lo,3,Mon Jul 13 09:54:06 2015 UTC,"Yes, but unlike the torsen/detroit diffs where an application of the brake briefly is enough to ""activate"" the locker, the brake has to be applied continuously to the wheel/s with no traction - but not to the wheel/s with traction."
4x4,3d22ld,_none_,-1,Mon Jul 13 11:34:01 2015 UTC,"oh cool didnt know that, explains why that car has huge break disks for heat and what not, it has extremely intrusive traction control, it jerks the car on turns like ""oh no way too fast"""
4x4,3d22ld,_none_,6,Mon Jul 13 16:22:47 2015 UTC,"Pretty sure they come with a viscous center diff and open diffs front and rear.  Driver can electronically lock the center, rear and front in that order.  the traction control systems work ok.  they have their limitations and work best to keep momentum going.  Open diffs send the power to the wheel with the least traction.  Traction control works by individually applying the brake the spinning wheel, making the opposite wheel get power and hopefully find traction. Still doesn't make up for true locking diffs."
4x4,3d22ld,Kiwibaconator,1 point,Mon Jul 13 01:51:14 2015 UTC,"no it actually has the fully locking 3 diffs, none of the cars 100k+ come with cheap awd system, range rover has a pretty clever clutch diff to prevent winding and it works really well, but i am not interested in it.  As far as I know, G63 has 3 old style fully locking differentials, they take a military car off the production belt, put a shiny engine inside, and make it look nice inside, the rest of it is the same thing they send off to armies around the world."
4x4,3d22ld,BaboonRockFighter,4,Mon Jul 13 09:57:45 2015 UTC,"right.  but when the diffs are unlocked, the front and rears are open, center is probably a viscous.  then you can hit the buttons to lock them."
4x4,3d22ld,BaboonRockFighter,2,Mon Jul 13 23:46:54 2015 UTC,Traction control works anytime the diff locks aren't engaged.
4x4,3d22ld,BaboonRockFighter,1 point,Wed Jul 15 00:10:23 2015 UTC,I would guess that once you lock 3 ways the TC becomes irrelevant. Who even drives G63 outside UAE and Saudi Arabia?

My old man's truck still has the original engine, but mine has been swapped out, the dude who owned it before me over heated it. The rest of the drive train is good, but it is starting to make a little rear end noise. The good thing is that so many of these trucks were produced, there are trucks in the salvage yards all over the place.

I guess it could have turned out different, but I wouldn't see a good old fashioned iron block not being able to take a bit of heat.

4x4,3czece,Gatodeocho,1 point,Sun Jul 12 15:51:28 2015 UTC,"Seems like it would just shear off if you're not perfectly level, figure out a way to have some telescoping legs. I'd do a piece of square steel tube with holes marked at various points and a pin to hold it there. Tabs on the top and holes in the mount so you can put a pin in there and move it around to adjust the angle too. The weight of a person is a lot to be rocking around on a piece of steel welded to 2"" square steel tube, no matter how good of a welder you are. Even if it holds for a few uses, it's going to fatigue and just rip off eventually.  Edit: The things in red other than on the hitch should be made removable and maybe even adjustable.

I think its a 3"" lift xd series wheels (if anyone can identify what xd wheels they are that'd be awesome I need a spare). The steps are aftermarket www.purefjcruiser.com has some that look similar. And 33"" cooper S/T maxx tires. That's all that's been done to it. I did a pioneer avh-2700bs double din dvd deck in the dash. Also the doors don't have the yellow trim inside, not sure if that was an option or not. There's really not much done to it as far as I know.

It can get very deep and if your tires are not at the right pressure you can get bogged down quick. Mud holes are the other problem, some trails get tight and the only way through them is the mud, I suggest staying on the sides of the holes it's usually the shallowest.   If you have time check out the Caranza Memorial pretty neat spot in the middle of no where!"

Now, if I bought it, I think in most cases, I would use it as a DD with a bit of off-road fun thrown in. For me, the Trail is much better.   Sure, the TRD Pro has the Bilstein shocks, but with just 270 HP from the engine, I just can't imagine people really taking it out and pounding on it all day. I know I wouldn't."

4x4,3cunae,CanineMutiny,2,Sat Jul 11 03:11:22 2015 UTC,"Right. My point is, with the TRD Pro, it seems that setup is more about to Baja race than rock crawl."
4x4,3cunae,Flashthunder,2,Sat Jul 11 13:17:06 2015 UTC,You don't need a massive amount of horsepower. You can tune a stock v8 half ton up to 400-500 hp but without the added modifications you won't really ever push it hard enough to see the difference from the power. 270 is plenty if you're trying to drive a stock vehicle in the desert.
4x4,3cunae,CanineMutiny,2,Sat Jul 11 21:55:11 2015 UTC,"It is plenty of HP, but it doesn't feel fast with the setup. Now, if you tuned the V6, you could get a lot more out of it for sure. I just think this setup is much better for lower speeds and rock crawling."
4x4,3cunae,Flashthunder,2,Sun Jul 12 02:13:21 2015 UTC,I don't know what your used to driving but my jeep with 200k miles was rated at only 190 factory and will go faster than I ever want to go in nearly all situations.

He had a few issues with fuel pump and wheel bearings, but the engines were strong as heck until the 2wd blew a head gasket at 860k miles (he replaced it with a 2wd Ford, yuk!).  He put the 2wd in the yard for parts to support the 4wd.  It was a custom order and remained stock until the day it died.  The 4wd is still rolling strong with around 600k miles.

They run the mail 6 days a week (someone else does it on Sunday).  They don't run the mail on Thanksgiving and Christmas Day.    So 12 years would be:   250 * 2 * 6 * 52 * 12 = 1.872 million miles   Believe me now?  Didn't want to say 2 million miles as I only knew one truck had 860k when it went boom, the other one had 600k miles when I was out there in 2014.  It's still running and still racking up miles.  He also has two other trucks, both Fords. A 2wd and a 4wd.  The mail contact requires him to have three trucks, but he tries to keeps four.

The little places in between are clay trails that are total soup when they're wet and hard rutted cement when they're dry.   When I haul ass off-road here, I break shit. The ruts on the trails are so hard and deep that tie rods exploding apart is a common occurrence.

4x4,3cr3ut,deprecated,2,Tue Jul 14 00:51:41 2015 UTC,The 03 would be a 4th gen. This is when the 4runner moved from a utility SUV to a luxury SUV. Way more fancy interior and drivetrain options. You're not going to get one of these for $5000. The 3rd gen is what you want for your price point.

4x4,3cr3ut,deprecated,1 point,Tue Jul 14 01:40:29 2015 UTC,I dont have any personal experience with anything beyond the 3rd gen but I know that the 4Runner finally getting a V8 was a big deal. Th drivetrain is AWD like the FJ80. These would be really awesome if you have to drive in snow in the winter where always on AWD is way better then selectable 4x4. Also if you ever want to tow anything the V8 is what you want. 8k sounds really reasonable.

4x4,3cqdjq,IggyWon,2,Thu Jul 9 23:07:21 2015 UTC,"You can get the mounts for the inside of your bed, but you will sacrifice bed space. Some people mount them on the roof, but it looks merpy in my opinion. You can also get a bumper with tire rack, which is expensive."

A roof mount would be ideal for me, but problem is physically lifting the spare tire, as I am a fairly lanky person. A hitch mount would likely be the most practical."
4x4,3cqdjq,magichobo3,2,Thu Jul 9 23:37:38 2015 UTC,Maybe a stronger underneath mount. My Toyota pickup uses a chain to hold it up
4x4,3cqdjq,SportsmanJake,2,Fri Jul 10 04:07:06 2015 UTC,I have a spare 33 shoved in the stock spare location on my f150. I ran an old ratchet strap around it and the frame for extra support since it is about 25 pounds heavier than the stick spare. It's worked fine. I'd replace the hoist and then add some additional support.

4x4,3cmtxl,3linkedyota,1 point,Fri Jul 10 01:27:46 2015 UTC,No issues as of yet. I'm not running the twin sticks so I can't chime in on that. The 4.7s could be very beneficial depending on what kind of wheeling you do. I'm glad I did it but I am constantly running trails like Fordyce and the Rubicon
4x4,3cmtxl,battlebattlehooah,2,Fri Jul 10 03:37:25 2015 UTC,"I see what you mean, the whole idea is that slower is better, but money was a factor, and I can always install the 4.7s after the fact if I want the extreme crawl ratio.  Thanks for your input."

4x4,3cmtxl,ihasfip,14,Thu Jul 9 04:12:23 2015 UTC,"Its a dual transfer case adapter.  This allows you to engage a second ""crawl box"", which effectively doubles your crawl ratio.  With a single factory transfer case and 5.29 gears in the diff, your crawl ratio is 47:1.  So with double transfer cases, it increases the ratio to 108:1.  Basically what that means is that your vehicle will go twice as slow, which can be of great benefit for increased traction, and you don't need to carry as much momentum to make it over obstacles.  Instead, you crawl over them very slowly, which gives you better control.  Also pictured is the twin stick setup.  This takes the place of the factory shifter for the rear case, and has two individual shifters for the high/low shift fork and the 2wd/4wd shift fork.  This makes it so you can be in 4 low low, but still just 2wd.  Hope that answers your question!"

4x4,3cmtxl,rednuck,6,Thu Jul 9 03:45:55 2015 UTC,"Excellent!  But I was wondering, if I want to put one case in high and one in low, does it matter which is which?  Would it be better one way or the other, or is it essentially the same?"
4x4,3cmtxl,rednuck,5,Thu Jul 9 03:53:33 2015 UTC,"I don't recall but the way my shifters were setup, I think I used low on the rear case, and then for double low engaged the front case. I could be mistaken. Been a few years since I had it."
4x4,3cmtxl,NorthernSpectre,4,Thu Jul 9 03:59:48 2015 UTC,"Alright, thanks anyways.  I was just thinking it might put more strain on one case than the other, depending which one is low or high, but I guess I'll have to try it for myself and find out!"
4x4,3cmtxl,NorthernSpectre,8,Thu Jul 9 04:13:40 2015 UTC,"You want to put the last one in low so that the front one isn't under as much stress. It multiplies torque through the gear reduction so anything after that reduction will see the increased torque, but anything before it won't."
4x4,3cmtxl,elitegunslinger,5,Thu Jul 9 04:19:23 2015 UTC,"Perfect!  Just the answer I was looking for.  I knew one way must be better than the other, but it makes perfect sense when you explain it like that.  Thank you!"

Getting late in the day, my mate from work got his Cruiser stuck in a sticky pit. We were all hooked in for a winch when a guy in a pretty worked sounding GQ Patrol rolled up and sat parked looking frustrated for a few minutes before asking if we wanted help. After assuring him that we should be okay, he boosted off around the corner and came up a few holes behind the stuck Cruiser. Didn't check the depth, didn't assess a line, just booted it into the first hole he saw. Stuck. Winch well and truly under water in pretty cold conditions.  We offered him a snatch, which he begrudgingly accepted as his girlfriend (in completely inappropriate clothing BTW) sniggered at his idiocy from the sidelines. He calls out quite aggressively ""Hey babe, make sure the iPad doesn't go missing!"" >Implying I would offer help then steal a shitty iPad.  Snatch connected, we go for a slow pull first, him window all the way down, head craned out looking backwards. Absolutely floors it. Mud straight in his face, all over the dashboard, windscreen, center console... Everywhere. He opens the door once he's out and the thing just drained for the longest time as we lost our shit laughing at his ego driven stupidity. That thing will take months to fully dry out, and the stink of bog water may never go away.  Hot tip: Don't be a douche, because karma's a bitch."

Anyway, I'm coming around a corner on a graded access road (takes you to Hurrah Pass and Chicken Corners) and hit the most slimy, slippery mud I've ever seen right before a water crossing.  I am so focused on not losing momentum and keeping it on the road that I don't get my window up.  A wave of mud comes in and completely coats the inside of the door, covers me, and makes it all the way to the inside of the rear hatch.  Years later when we sold that Jeep, you could still see the Moab stains on the seat belt.  I did get some thumbs up back in town from some guys in rock buggies.

4x4,3clkg3,ihasfip,5,Thu Jul 9 03:54:39 2015 UTC,"Have two at this point, a 5 ton and a C304 Volvo.  They are very different animals.  I bought the Volvo first, I was looking for a replacement for my venerable XJ Cherokee, for off-roading and camping up in the rockies.  The downside of the cherokee for me, was a lack of room for stuff.  I started looking at older suburbans that I could maybe lift and keep relatively nimble off-road,  then someone pointed me to a Pinzgauer.   I took a look at the pinzgauers and got to see a few of them up-close and personal, they were still a bit smaller than i wanted, but I found the Volvo C304 around the same time, and it wound up being ideal for me, size-wise.  Not too big, not too small, and ooooh baby can this thing off-road like nothing I've ever seen.   I wanted to turn it into a camper for the Rocky Mountains here in Colorado, and I'm almost finished - I can seat 6, plus have a lot of storage and a full queen size bed in the back, which is usable without even having to fold the rear seats.  (I do fold them, because I'm 6'3"", and I like having some extra room for my feet to dangle.)   I don't daily drive it, but it could certainly be used for that task - Its a manual transmission and non-powered steering,  so it's a bit of a workout going slow and in parking lots, but you get used to that.   Parts for the Volvo were in a really bad state earlier,  however there's now a company that bought up the rights to the old trucks, and all the spares, from volvo (tatanka.nu), and are actively working with suppliers to make new spares for everything that had run dry.  I cannot thank these guys enough.    In the Volvo's case, it also has Portal axles, so that adds a small layer to maintainence,  but it's still doable with two people.  We just replaced the CV boots on mine as they were leaking,  and last year we replaced the entire brake system.  Next up is going to be body work and paint, and electric wiring.  Almost done!  The other truck we have is an M923A2 5 ton truck.   This ... is a completely different animal from the Volvo.  The Volvo feels like you're driving a pickup or van,  with the 5 ton, you are driving a TRUCK. The nice thing about it is, unlike the volvo, it's got an automatic transmission and power steering.   Which is good because I can't imagine trying to move that thing around town without both.  Blind spots are huge and everywhere on it, and it's so insanely large you're constantly worried about encroaching someone else's lane.   But it is a giggle.    Maintainence is also a completely different story - parts are everywhere and cheap,   but when you do fluid changes, you are dealing with GALLONS instead of Quarts.    You need AT LEAST two people just to move a tire. To do work on the engine, you crawl into and on and around the engine bay.  It's like working on a damn Tank.   While the Volvo COULD be a daily driver, (I'd rather drive my C304 than say a VW Microbus, seriously it's easier),  the 5 ton is not.  In my opinion of course.    We got the 5 ton for a specific task, which will be moving a lot of heavy machine equipment halfway across country.   We may keep it afterwards as a toy, or we may sell it and buy something else fun.     Registration and Insurance was interesting as well.  The Volvo is old enough to be emissions exempt, which is very nice, in that normal emissions stations cannot test a 6x6 drivetrain.   Due to it not having a standard vin, and California (where I bought it) and Colorado (Where I live) wanting to use two different parts of it's ID plate as the vin, it took me 2 months and several calls and a letter from the state IRS to allow me to register it (basically a waiver saying ""The vins don't match but that's ok, it's not stolen, go ahead and register it as a new vin"").  Thankfully insuring it was easy - I called up Geico, who my jeep was insured with, and they just insured it.   I even had to stop the guy and say ""Wait a minute, let me explain just what this thing is..."" to make sure he wasn't confused.   But no, Geico insured it straight up.  The 5 ton.... Was easy to register. Uses standard US Vin info. They had to record the manufacturer as TRUK (yes literally TRUK) because BMY wasn't in the system, (but TRUK was I guess), but that's fine.   Ours was pre-registered elsewhere at 26,000 lbs GVWR - 26,001 requires a CDL.   The real capability is of course far above that, but so long as we do not exceed 26,000 GVWR,  we're good.  (and even moving our equipment, we won't).   Insuring it though...   Oh man. Nobody would touch it. Nobody would touch it with a 10 foot pole.   We wound up temporarily getting ""Parade vehicle"" insurance from a specialty insurer,  which requires some insane restrictions on where you can park it, when you can drive it, what you can do with it, etc etc etc.    We won't be able to use it to move our stuff when we move,  but by that point we're going to add a small fiberglass cover and bolt a folding cot to the floor.   Because at that point, according to the insurance companies, it's an RV!  and RV's are exempt from just about everything thanks to the AARP, and we can just insure it as an RV and use it however we want.    Yes, ""Is there a bed in it"" is literally the only thing keeping it from being an RV according to 5 different insurance agents we talked to.   It's bizarre.   Anyways, message me or reply if you have any questions."

4x4,3cfnhr,RockyMountainRider,18,Tue Jul 7 18:24:10 2015 UTC,Slap a roll cage onto the Ranger and no one will say anything about your doors. I wouldn't run doorless without one personally.
4x4,3cfnhr,jcdj1996,4,Tue Jul 7 15:58:44 2015 UTC,You ever look at the stock cage on a wrangler? It is no more sturdy than a sheet metal cabin of another vehicle. It is super thin gauge pipe that is bolted together.   Example: http://www.genright.com/images/Content/Landing%20Pages/Roll%20Cage/Untitled-1.jpg
4x4,3cfnhr,DogFarm,20,Tue Jul 7 18:28:28 2015 UTC,"In that picture, the cage itself is still pretty much intact, the windshield and front bars folded but that is because they aren't part of the roll structure. The roll structure of most vehicles includes the door, and removing that compromises it.   I'm not arguing that Wranglers are necessarily going to be much safer doorless, but that they'll handle a rollover similarly with or without doors, whereas a Ranger will benefit from having them."
4x4,3cfnhr,jcdj1996,2,Tue Jul 7 18:39:46 2015 UTC,"Not half as much as you might think. The tops of doors are not structural to any point above keeping the window located and the door seal tight. You can deform a door frame by hand. When we unlock vehicles, we put a little hand pump airbag between the body and the door and simply spread the door away from the body. It has happened the the door will get stretched and not close just right which can be fixed by leaning on it. The glass itself is more energy absorbing in a wreck that the top of the door.  /r/hookit"

That said, I wheeled the snot out of mine for many years with no suspension-related problems. It didn't perform as well as a higher quality kit, but it wasn't a liability on the trail, either.

When you are inches away from a cliff with large boulders, stumps, logs, ect... lining your path being able to see what is happening 6 inches to the left of your clutch foot outside the vehicle can make the difference when trying to get unstuck.  2:airflow... When using an older beater vehicle that you don't care about filling above the windows with mud chances are your not going to spend money to install an AC system if it never had one from the factory or replace the system that hasn't worked in years.  3: easier to get out of... When driving up mountain passes it is real easy to unclick the seatbelt and throw yourself in the direction that the door used to be when the ground gives way and the vehicle starts to flip thousands of feet into a chasm. As for fjording rivers their are no doors to bucket the water turning the vehicle into a mobile hot tub complete with cup holders. Instead it allows the water to drain immediately.  And for the cold this is an off road vehicle ment to be driven in summer or year round In Georgia or other warm places. I enjoy driving in the snow probably more than most people but I'm going to be focusing on keeping on the road not driving through multiple feet of snow on non visible trails.  Edit:  1:Easier to see if he had back doors he could look over his shoulder then look almost directly at his rear tire  2:River crossing with door Notice at the end they opened the door to drain the water  3:Where it would have been useful to not open a door and fling yourself out"
4x4,3cfnhr,croastbeast,0,Tue Jul 7 23:06:40 2015 UTC,"Counter counter argument-  1) if you are traversing such dangers as large boulders and cliffs within inches,  you should be using a spotter, and are being reckless if not. This makes this degree of ease of visibility moot.   2)  honestly, if you are genuinely saying that they only way to not overheat yourself is to remove the doors, because your vehicle is such a beater POS that there's no other way to cool yourself, you have bigger issues. And doesn't at all explain how removing doors makes for ""significant benefits in off-roading.""  It shows me you care less about safety that a marginal amount of additional airflow over open windows.   3) this is absurd. Are you saying that if your vehicle was gonna roll, you could unbelted and jump out before falling into a chasm?  Seriously?  Why wear seat belts?  Why not remove the roll cage? That's a weak argument. VERY WEAK. Water crossing?  Done them. Got water inside. It drains from the floorboard regardless of doors. Lack of doors just guarantee water inside. No benefit. Weather changes. It gets cold. Buggy. Rainy. Wild animals arrive.   You have made 3 poor rationalization a for removing doors. Using unrealistic, unsafe, or inapplicable evidence."

Given, this is coming from someone whose car very much has all four doors on it. I'm sure someone with more experience with this could give you more benefits. But, from a less functional standpoint, there's just something about being more open to the air when my windows are all down and my sunroof is open, so I can assume having the doors off would be even better in that respect. From my standpoint, anyway, having the doors off a car has its own set of benefits and drawbacks as having the doors on the car does. Frankly, both methods are used by a lot of people who offroad a lot more often than I do,  so there must be some merit to either."
4x4,3cfnhr,Gnatshit,5,Tue Jul 7 23:29:29 2015 UTC,"Lol calm down its reddit, I didn't vote anything. People are going to have different opinions, and it's a beautiful thing.  Well the biggest benefit would be line of sight viability. I don't know how many times I have opened my door to get a better view .Second would be  less possibility of body  damage . Third, off the top of my head would be weight reduction. Lighter is always better.  Nothing wrong with doing it just for fun, those guys that have modified jeeps and don't use them support your ability to have so many options and progress the aftermarket options by spending money. Just an opinion tho."
4x4,3cfnhr,croastbeast,-3,Tue Jul 7 21:57:53 2015 UTC,"FYI-I wasnt aiming that at you.  I was talking to everyone EXCEPT you who cant even comment.  Its frustrating, because Im just asking a viewpoint, and I get little or no input.    1) visibility- Ive already addressed this a couple times.  I dont see how  a removed door makes anything MORE visible  It makes it visible without having to move your head outside the door or window.  To me, thats not an advantage.  Its a laziness cheat.  2) Sure less possibility of vehicle body damage.  But, if thats an argyument, then theres more chance of human body damage.  Thats an unequivocable argument.  And thats a stupid tradeoff.  3)Weight savings- OK I can buy this one.  Albeit a nominal saving. AGain, beneficial enough for the potential drawbacks?  Not even close in my book.  Ill just leave the shovel and axe and Hi Lift etc if Im that worried about weight, and leave the parts of the vehicle that protect me.  4)DOing it for fun- THIS is why I think most do it.  They believ it looks COOL.  And again, if thats it, so be it.  But again, thats a stupid tradeoff for safety.  The doors protect the driver from injury, insulate the inside of the vehicle from debris.  Opening the footwell (and throttle and brake controls) to outside factors is a foolish act in my book.  Especially if its to ""look cool"".  AGain, if thats what it is, so be it.,  But then dont try to paint it as having huge benefits."
4x4,3cfnhr,Gnatshit,2,Tue Jul 7 22:10:25 2015 UTC,I can see both sides to the argument for sure.

4x4,3cfnhr,DeepSouthTJ,2,Fri Jul 10 04:36:19 2015 UTC,"The same benefits that taking the top down provide, it's a fun open experience with slightly better visibility, no more no less. I can't think of a single real disadvantage to going doorless except maybe the potential to get muddy."
4x4,3cfnhr,croastbeast,-1,Fri Jul 10 08:06:50 2015 UTC,"What about the vast array of driver injuries that can easily be had without the protection of a door?  Yeah, inconsequential. Far better to be ""cool""."
4x4,3cfnhr,DeepSouthTJ,2,Tue Jul 7 23:32:00 2015 UTC,"My Jeeps doors won't do much in a wreck (theres even a warning telling you this), I'm sure the bolts holding it in would pull right out of the sheet metal rendering the door all but useless. Besides Jeep safety test the Wrangler without doors and it passes, even in 2015. And about the ""looking cool"" and ""poser"" comments, I don't give two shits what people think about my doors, I just enjoy the open feeling like I already said in my original response.  And even if going doorless is unsafe, so is going on the trails in the first place but I'm not going to stop that either."
4x4,3cfnhr,croastbeast,0,Tue Jul 7 23:46:44 2015 UTC,"Youre proving my case.  The doors apparently wont do ""much"".  But theyll do 1000000X more than NO DOORS.  And theyll prevent contact from brush, rocks, branches, debris, etc from the driver, the floor pedlas, the interior instruments when offroading.  If youre referring to vehicular collisions, again, even remotely suggesting that removing bodywork that is ""rendered all but useless"" is safer for you is patently fucking absurd dude.  And yes, IM sure it ""passes"" with the safety inspection.  It doesnt mean its safer without.  And thank you for validating my point.  You do it because you LIKE it, and dont care if it's unsafe.  Thats your admission.  Fine so be it.  I dont care.  But dont try to convince me it makes it somehow safer or better."
4x4,3cfnhr,DeepSouthTJ,1 point,Wed Jul 8 00:21:42 2015 UTC,"I never implied it was somehow safer without the doors, just that the difference isn't significant enough for me to worry about.

They're not allowed to sell them to the public since they basically just get ragged on for a few months and they will sometimes not be exactly the same as the production model. It'd be cool if they were allowed to sell them as vehicles not for road use so they at least get to live off road for the rest of their lives.

I settled for the L200 because I also love it deeply, and also it's way more practical. Then the engine died on me with 6 months of use. Thanks for never changing the oil, mr. previous owner. Now I'm saving up for a new engine. Which I can't afford at all. /rant  Anyway I love those things."

4x4,3ccckm,KayakBassFisher,2,Mon Jul 6 21:02:58 2015 UTC,"Yeah, for sure, much more cost effective to swap out the stock suspension on a Trail for upgrades.

When the wheel came back down it was all over for the diff. BANG BANG CLUNK BANG BANG    Still drove it up the last leg of the climb ... and 60 miles back home. It tried to lock up a few times at 75mph but I made it to the house.   Apparently TOYOTA IFS spider gears are known to be pretty weak."

4x4,3cdg62,matth1,1 point,Tue Jul 7 04:04:21 2015 UTC,"I drive a TD42 GQ Patrol on 33's. It gets me pretty much anywhere. But it's not fast, and it's not great in sand, it lacks power.  Maybe I'll turbo it one day, but for now it suits as a decent tourer and weekend warrior.  Patrols have a pretty bullet proof drivetrain, and with solid axles and coil springs all round its nice and flexy. The TD42 is also pretty much bullet proof, provided its been taken care of. It's a popular motor choice so you might have to look around a bit to find one in good shape.  You can get a petrol much cheaper, but it'll drink a bit more. Lower servicing costs though.  If you're not doing anything too extreme though pretty much anything will work. Find something with a few mods you want already done, it will save you some cash."

4x4,3cdg62,NorthernSpectre,2,Tue Jul 7 06:29:27 2015 UTC,Id go a solid axle Hilux. Early to mid 90s are tough as nails and should be able to get something reasonably good for around the 10k mark. And the amount of aftermarket parts is crazy good. But it also depends on if you want a ute or full size 4wd. If wanting full size I suggest an 80 or 105 series diesel.
4x4,3cdg62,Reqel,1 point,Wed Jul 8 11:03:41 2015 UTC,"Yeah I mean no doubt the lux is great man, but in all seriousness the only things I do know, is that I want a wagon. Cheers anyway 👌"

4x4,3cdg62,Kiwibaconator,1 point,Fri Jul 10 23:26:06 2015 UTC,"Meh, I prefere a wagon where I can transport people, don't need that much space for cargo. The fuel capacity might make me reconcider, depending on the difference."

4x4,3c8yxb,Kiwibaconator,0,Mon Jul 6 10:57:49 2015 UTC,They couldn't handle anything more than a twig. Go push in the middle of the wire and watch your sheet metal buckle.

The way these are attached, the other crap he keeps bolting to the vehicle and the rake on his windscreen makes them both not going to work and not needed.   Plus the fact he's been promising photos of them in use and has none.  Doesn't even have pics showing tree debris wedged in the wires.  Do you also think rolling coal looks cool?"

Don't get me wrong, I'm not knocking people who find it fun and entertaining, but doing most my exploring in sensitive mountains or deserts means no ripping up the place - that's how trails get closed.  Clearly this is at a farm or something, so that's not an issue.  I try to avoid mud if possible, it gets into the u-joints, alternator, and seals and starts grinding them down.  I used to go splash in the mud at the OHV park until I got tired of having crap fall in my face at every oil change and any moving part start to wear prematurely.    Again, not knocking it as something people like to do (as long as they are not ripping up the meadows and getting trails closed off), it's just not my thing."

It loaded all the weight and power onto my Dana 35 and snapped off the 4 bolts holding the ujoint.... Which then dropped my drive shaft on the ground as I started rolling backwards. I almost shit myself when it spun sideways as I was rolling backwards. Fuuuuck. That shit is scary!

4x4,3c4yo6,Tiny311,2,Sun Jul 5 14:17:01 2015 UTC,"I'm guessing that the back doesn't flex well because the springs are too stiff, since it's a 3/4 ton.   The front probably doesn't move well because it's a radius arm setup. The only articulation you get out of radius arms is from the bushings allowing the radius arms to twist. If you want lots of articulation you need to go to a linked setup. Or you could go with leafs in the front, that would be kinda cool."

My only gripe is the drop in power above 5000'. Even the relatively bad turbo of the 6.5 would help out a ton at elevation.   I plan on putting together an HX-35 setup with relatively low boost. More horsepower would be cool, but I really want it for consistent performance in the mountains."
4x4,3brts9,tcdent,3,Wed Jul 1 20:58:18 2015 UTC,"Reliable, but you could honestly get more power out of a potato. The earlier humvee's had them coupled with either a th350 (6.2, 3 speed, these have no park) or the th400 (6.5l, 4 speed with an actual park, but they still make us use chock blocks) and both combo's were (are) just awful for power. I used to be stationed in the desert and low was the only way to get enough torque and power to all 4 wheels to get through the stuff."
4x4,3brts9,kizzlebizz,2,Wed Jul 1 21:18:40 2015 UTC,"The used engines are cheap. Nothing really wrong with the 6.2/6.5 for the time period they were engineered and made. Compared to modern diesels or the old 5.9 Cummins they are dogs. But the military doesn't build trucks to go fast.  They were put into ALOT of applications during the 90's. School buses, Boats, box trucks, Hmmwv's, etc.  Most of the problems started creeping up when GM introduced the turbocharged version, problems with the block design became apparent when they switched to the '506 casting for the turbo diesels. The cooling jacket design combined with the metallurgy lead to cracked webbings and the common #8 cylinder failure.  This wasn't really fixed in the 96-00 time frame until a newer casting was designed by GM, at that point they switched to the Duramax.   The 6.5 at that point was sold off to AM General, who redesigned the block again [the casting date code was changed from A 000 to A 00 00 which is a easy way to id these blocks]. This was the ""fixed"" design that started appearing in military HMMWV's in the 00's. The Civilian Hummer H1 was pretty much used as a guinea pig for the military as they figured out the turbo issues [early Turbo H1's had plenty of issues with cracked blocks].  A few years ago, the 506 GEP casting used for the Optimizer 6500 engines [AM General trade name for their redesign 6.5] was replaced with a newer design, designated P400. That engine has the same bolt hole and accessory layout but it was a new design, featuring a totally new lower girdle that surrounds the main bearing caps along with other upgrades. These can be identified by the squared off bottom end that is completely flat with a cast aluminum oil pan.  These can work in chevy/gm applications but with 4x4 you'll need an special aftermarket oil pan since the OEM is designed for the HMMWV running gear.  They make a detuned 6.5/P400 for installation into older 6.2 trucks.  I'd stick to the US made engines and avoid the import versions which are based upon old casting designs but are often sold as ""the newest casting"". The imports are usually missing the casting numbers.  Legit engines will have Detroit Diesel, GM, Navistar or GEP markings/badges somewhere on the block."
4x4,3brts9,Oblagon,1 point,Sat Jul 4 18:42:14 2015 UTC,"I had an 83 blazer with the 6.2L and I'd consider it one of the worst purchases I ever made.  Maybe it was a fluke since everyone loves theirs.  I was told the engine is based off a gas engine, which is why it sucks compared to other diesel engines.  I thought it was underpowered on flat ground.  My injection pump failed, that was a fun expense in college.  Definitely was not a good vehicle for short trips around town = frequent dead batteries due to how many amps it took to start it up vs what alternator would replace.  Mine also had transmission issues.  I think I spent 6 months and 3 rebuilds before it was finally ok, then I sold it and ran before something else came up.  Aside from the diesel, the k5 blazer was one of the funnest vehicles I ever owned, but sold it because I couldn't afford to keep putting money into it.  When I got it, there were 35s and a ridiculous 8"" of lift.  ditched the body lift, built a front and rear cattle killer bumper, painted it camo (different than the military ones), stripped the interior and Herculined it, always ran with no doors or top.  Exhaust with glasspacks exiting before tires was loud enough to set off car alarms, so of course I had to crank my simple stereo sytem everywhere (infinity plate speakers in dash, 12"" sub in back)."
4x4,3brts9,the_perkolator,2,Wed Jul 1 21:28:46 2015 UTC,This... I worked on a lot of vehicles. The bottom end is manufactured for gasoline applications. They were not built to take that kind of compression. There is not a whole lot of these left due to this reason.
4x4,3brts9,abowlofvirus,2,Wed Jul 1 22:31:28 2015 UTC,"That is not actually correct. The 5.7 Oldsmobile diesel engine was based of a gasoline engine (and had a world of problems as a result).

I once bought an old International Travelall that had been sitting for a while in the woods for a couple hundred bucks, took it home, put fresh gas in the tank and gave it a new battery, then pressure washed and waxed the outside. Went from looking like the bottom of a lake to looking like a really shiny brown suv. Got a couple grand for it, most money I've ever made for such little work."
4x4,3bl5om,My_Name_Is_Santa,1 point,Tue Jun 30 04:44:21 2015 UTC,I need to do that soon. Though when you start it up you can hear that it has a loud exhaust leak which gives away the fact the truck has issues
4x4,3bl5om,magichobo3,1 point,Tue Jun 30 05:07:44 2015 UTC,Where's it leaking from? Exhaust leaks aren't usually that hard unless it's a broken stud in the head(of which I have 2 that I'm just leaving alone)
4x4,3bl5om,magichobo3,1 point,Tue Jun 30 05:10:06 2015 UTC,One of the studs is missing in the head. I tried to replace it but the hole has been drilled and retapped bigger. So now I have to drill into the manifold to fit a larger bolt through.
4x4,3bl39a,po_toter,16,Tue Jun 30 02:32:00 2015 UTC,"Mud = hp / big tires / dif clearance/ lockers . Just keep it leaf sprung . swap a  sbc 350, 383... whatever. Beefier trans. Rebuild axles with chromo axles ,gusset the housings. Regear, add lockers. Lift springs/ cut fenders. Orrrrr buy something not Toyota for mud bogging. Something already equipped with more than 120 hp and Dana 60s or 14 bolt rear ends."
4x4,3bl39a,Gnatshit,2,Tue Jun 30 02:56:57 2015 UTC,"I'm not looking to just play in the mud. I dont want a mud bogger. I'm wanting to put on 35's, nothing really bigger than that. I just want a general off-road truck that can take abuse an isn't a crawler build."
4x4,3bl39a,Gnatshit,1 point,Tue Jun 30 14:20:40 2015 UTC,"Okay , I would still keep it leaf sprung. Look at marlin crawler kits, you could do Chevy springs in rear . Keep the 22r and regear. The best way to know what you want is to wheel the stock rig for awhile .That way you will know what you need for your style of wheeling."
4x4,3bl39a,Sick4747,1 point,Tue Jun 30 15:17:41 2015 UTC,"yea, Im going to keep it stock for a bit. drive it around, see if there are any problems I need to fix first.    I am going to be learning a lot with this truck so Im going to take my time. My first bit of work will probably be learning to weld and making bumpers.     What is the difference between leaf springs, and say, a 3-link kit?    again, Im not looking to mud bug. Just want to be able to hand a little bit of mud and not worry too much."
4x4,3bl39a,A_KingofSpain,1 point,Tue Jun 30 16:20:59 2015 UTC,"http://imgur.com/CVR9LP1 Here's my 85 4Runner. It's mostly stock 270,000 on 22re with 31 m/t. I agree you should wheel it stock until you know where your lacking. I don't crawl it I also don't romp it either both of those will break things. I about to upgrade to Old Man Emu leaf springs. Then regear and up tire size. But it still currently gets me up trails I'd never want to walk up. I think old toyotas are the best all around trail rigs( reliable/capable). Just go wheel and see what is lacking then upgrade that."
4x4,3bl39a,My_Name_Is_Santa,4,Wed Jul 1 16:29:58 2015 UTC,"First, what engine trans and transfer case are under your yota?   Second, you need to know exactly what you plan on doing with your truck. Hill climbing? Mud bogging? Mud racer? Once you know what you want out of it then you start with your build.   If money truely isnt a problem then the possibilities are endless."
4x4,3bl39a,A_KingofSpain,4,Tue Jun 30 03:46:28 2015 UTC,"It's all stock right now.  22r engine, manual.  I'd like to be able to drive through mud and water.  Not really mud  bogging, but I would like deep mud/water.     I'm willing to  go  20k into this, but it ain't be all at once."
4x4,3bl39a,you_know_how_I_know,8,Tue Jun 30 03:56:19 2015 UTC,"That engine doesn't make enough power to go fast, especially not with bigger tires and through mud. What I would do is toss and sbc in it and stick a turbo 350 or 400 trans in it depending on how much power it makes. Make it taller, stick some bigger tires on it, you might have to throw different axles under it, but I'm not sure how strong the stockers are. Is the body in good condition? If it is, I'd say you should find a more beat up truck to do this with, but it's up to you. IMO if you are building an old truck to get beat up off road you should start with a beat up truck. Let the good ones stay good for future generations to enjoy and take the ones destined for the scrap yard in a few years and build them into something. Oh yeah, and you're probably going to want to cage that thing, exocage because they're just that much cooler. Do you have any pictures of it?"
4x4,3bl39a,A_KingofSpain,1 point,Tue Jun 30 04:36:40 2015 UTC,The rear axle has the same shaft diameter as a ford 9 inch. If he was keeping the 22r i would recommend the stock solid axles with cromolly but since he wants deep mud he needs 36+ tires 1ton axles beefy trans/ transfer case Exocage because its safe and looks cool If he really wants some low gearing he can twin stick his transfer case
4x4,3bl39a,Boogge,1 point,Tue Jun 30 12:53:51 2015 UTC,"Definitely agree on an engine swap, but why cage a bogger? If he isn't crawling or doing technical trails it seems like the rollover risk is low, especially once he gets wide tires.  Also, +1 on show us the photos!  edit: nevermind, I just saw his post above saying that he isn't building strictly for bogging."
4x4,3bl39a,hookydoo,1 point,Tue Jun 30 16:56:01 2015 UTC,Deep mud calls for more power. My recommendation is sbc with a turbo 400 and a beefy transfer case (I would use a np205). The problem you will have with this setup is the front axle should be a dana 60 and those are hard to come by. Chevy front dana 60 is gonna run you about 1k. I would be more than happy to guide you along with this if you want to PM me from time to time
4x4,3bl39a,magichobo3,2,Tue Jun 30 12:46:13 2015 UTC,Here's the trick. Join an offroad club and go on trail runs with them. Don't think your truck will make it yet? I'm sure anyone would be more than thrilled to have you ride a long for a few bucks for gas. They will probably even let you drive it a little. Join an offroad forum to look at what others have done. Pirate4x4 is a good place to see what others have done with a variety of vehicles for a variety of terrain. Even if you start with a small lift kit and some mud terrain tires and a Lincoln locker you will see and learn what you need before spending all your cash on a huge project. When you get to the point of knowing what you want an idea would be to buy a donor 1 ton 4x4 truck and put all the running gear/engine into your Toyota. I'm guessing you really like the Toyota to be willing to put so much money into it. If not then look at other vehicles. A benefit of joining a club and knowing which direction you want to go is you haven't  sunk all your money into it yet.
4x4,3bl39a,Flys_Lo,1 point,Tue Jun 30 06:45:04 2015 UTC,the money im will to spend is going to be over years of using it. not all at once. I just gave the number because I dont want to buy something cheap now then replace later on down the road.

4x4,3bhuj6,reefza,74,Mon Jun 29 10:09:30 2015 UTC,"So obviously this guy has no business on that obstacle or even moving his transfer case into 4WD. However rather than simply saying that and going about our day. Lets start a discussion on how this situation can be avoided.   First and foremost skinny pedal is for muddy hill climbs, not for climbing rocks and step ups. Yes there are times when you will need to provide a bump to get over an obstacle however it should be done once you have settled your tires against said obstacle rather than trying to do it all without stopping like this guy. On this particular instance the proper method should have been to bump over the first step up, slowly crawl to the next one and attempt to crawl with lockers first and then bump again if unable to crawl it. He simply bumped over the first step up and just kept it hammered down.   He also made the mistake of hitting the brake once his hood began to raise. You can see this when his truck is standing upright like a bear standing up on 2 legs. He also does not appear to be listening to his spotter at all and if I had to guess I'd say he is a ""I've got it don't worry"" kind of guy."
4x4,3bhuj6,sqWADooSh,29,Mon Jun 29 14:06:25 2015 UTC,"Thank you for this. I'm new to 4 wheeling and although I might recognize when someone is doing something wrong, I might not know what exactly that wrong thing is. Thanks for explaining it!"
4x4,3bhuj6,cme884,9,Mon Jun 29 16:05:35 2015 UTC,"That was my thought process, that new guys could hear the proper way to go about it. Glad to help."
4x4,3bhuj6,sqWADooSh,11,Mon Jun 29 16:38:11 2015 UTC,He also looks like he's running with his tires at full pressure and I am wondering if he's using a low gear range at all.
4x4,3bhuj6,Zaskoda,4,Mon Jun 29 17:53:41 2015 UTC,I wouldn't be surprised.
4x4,3bhuj6,sqWADooSh,4,Mon Jun 29 20:14:33 2015 UTC,"Mind explaining what's wrong with hitting the brakes when the hood came up? I assume that would be better than hitting the gas, is the best thing to just let off the pedals entirely?"
4x4,3bhuj6,ssschillings,10,Mon Jun 29 20:04:31 2015 UTC,"I imagine the reasoning is that by braking you lock up your tires which would create a pivot point for the backwards momentum, making it easier to flip up as opposed to staying on all 4 tires. If you dont brake immediately the momentum would push you back down the hill and bring your front end back down."
4x4,3bhuj6,wellLUCkyme,5,Mon Jun 29 20:17:16 2015 UTC,Let go of the brakes and the rear wheels would roll down allowing the front to stay on the ground. Press the brakes and the wheels lock up but the momentum keeps going. Pretty much the same thing the other guy said just a little more ELI5.
4x4,3bhuj6,yota-runner,2,Mon Jun 29 21:51:54 2015 UTC,"Mind explaining what's wrong with hitting the brakes when the hood came up? I assume that would be better than hitting the gas, is the best thing to just let off the pedals entirely?"
4x4,3bhuj6,ssschillings,6,Mon Jun 29 20:04:31 2015 UTC,It creates a pivot point for the momentum of the front of the truck to tip over just like you see in the video. This is another reason that manuals are better for wheeling. You can give it a touch of clutch when it starts to raise which will cause your rear tires to roll backwards which will bring the front end down.
4x4,3bhuj6,sqWADooSh,2,Mon Jun 29 20:12:15 2015 UTC,"Your natural reaction is gonna be to hit the brakes.  Hitting the brakes or the gas is the wrong decision when the hood is rising like that.  At least with hitting the brakes you have have a second or so to correct, while hitting the gas will send you upside down and tumbling down the hill asap.  Anyways, moral of the story. if your spinning your tires to get over an obstacle prepare for something to break."
4x4,3bhuj6,NotAnExpertWitness,2,Mon Jun 29 22:46:30 2015 UTC,Correct it is the natural reaction. You have to train yourself to not follow that natural reaction.

4x4,3bhuj6,ididnotdoitever,2,Tue Jun 30 01:08:06 2015 UTC,"I've seen this happen a couple times. It's a noob move, bouncing the clutch because the vehicle is bucking, and then it happens a couple more times, each more violently until they jump on the brake. Usually it ends worse than this."

4x4,3bhuj6,captanoblivious,5,Mon Jun 29 13:26:04 2015 UTC,Yes. That tire saved his ass because he was incredibly lucky.    Not to mention he had ages to pop it in reverse and bump it back down.  (Anyone smart enough for that wouldn't have gotten in that situation though)
4x4,3bhuj6,MountJEEP,2,Mon Jun 29 13:35:23 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty new to all this but he seemed like he was just gunning it with no control of his vehicle!? I don't think your front tires should ever pop in the air like that and if they do, you shouldn't try it again going even fast."
4x4,3bhuj6,captanoblivious,3,Mon Jun 29 16:56:19 2015 UTC,"His initial speed wasn't really too fast it was him not staying on the trail and letting the front tires hit the wall and drive up tipping him back, all while not slowing down. He was completely out of control."
4x4,3bhuj6,V4refugee,9,Mon Jun 29 17:03:52 2015 UTC,"Don't go on a trail you can't handle, start slow, know your limitations, watch youtube videos, take an experienced friend, join an offroad club, gain experience, and then maybe you could consider going up an incline like that."
4x4,3bhuj6,captanoblivious,6,Mon Jun 29 18:46:07 2015 UTC,"Start small and work your way up,  think before you drive,( dont just start blindly driving up something, look at it and compar it to your vehicle)  go with someone who knows (this guy even had a spotter) and always go slow until you know what your doing.  Very little damage happens sub 5mph, many obstacles can be done at a dead slow speed. Wheeling is about maintaining a balance between traction and momentum. But really the only way to learn is to start very small on almost dirt roads and just slowly find what your vehicle is  capable of and how YOU need to drive it. For this reason I also advocate starting with a stock vehicle and learning what it needs rather than buying parts and having to learn in a vehicle that is more capable than you can drive it. I started in a stock grand cherokee and quickly learned I needed some more clrearance and bought a tiny lift as cheap as possible. Than needed tires since I had tiny highway tires that slipped easy. After that it was sliders, than shocks/swaybars. And it just escalated from there. But ive noticed that I have always been wheeling in groups that have wayyyy more built rigs and I keep up just fine, I atribute that to me knowing my vehicle extremely well due to slowly testing the limits. I also havent spent too much money because I only have the parts that are actually nessesary."

Use the DMV fee calculator they have in their site, fill in the blanks with what you know. My bigger concern is swapping in a diesel to a non-diesel (smog required) vehicle. In California, this is VERY difficult to LEGALLY do. Go talk to your local referee station at the nearest CHP office. 4BT is a medium duty engine. You're swapping it into a passenger vehicle. Not sure that's allowed. Never found the 4BT to be a good swap for smaller vehicles anyway. It's like 150 pounds heavier than the 4.0, which is already a heavy engine. Your life though."
4x4,3bh9ef,Billy_VW,3,Thu Jul 2 23:00:36 2015 UTC,Thanks.  I knew it was heavier but just not sure how well the Jeep will handle the extra weight.
4x4,3bh9ef,aussie_jason,4,Mon Jun 29 14:59:41 2015 UTC,"Well it's definitely not impossible. I quick google/youtube search shows that it's been done. In California? That I don't know. Getting your gauges to work will be tough, and necessary to pass visual inspection. Plus I don't know if those guys actually wheel their 4BT. The amount of torque that it has also means you'll have to get a new transmission (maybe), new transfer case (definitely) and new axles (most definitely). However, if you DON'T intend to wheel it, it would be fine for street use without having to swap all that stuff out.  If nothing else, think about this. I swapped in a small block chevy into my smog exempt CJ5, and it was a massive pain. This is a swap that has tons and tons of documentation, it's been done many times, and all of the adapters that I need for it are out there, plus I don't have to worry about emissions or visual inspection..... and it was STILL a massive pain. BUT today I'm really REALLY happy with my Jeep. Just throwing it out there man, I wish you luck and hope it all works out for you."
4x4,3bh9ef,Gnatshit,2,Mon Jun 29 22:50:14 2015 UTC,"Thank you!    I earlier googled ""LS swap Cherokee"" and came across this build and holy mother, this guy did some of the best work I've ever seen.  I'm going to try and contact him, because I'm in love with this combo.  He didn't seem to complain about the difficulty.  I'm curious, what were the real buggers that gave you pain?"
4x4,3bh9ef,Gnatshit,2,Mon Jun 29 23:15:22 2015 UTC,"For my build specifically (early CJ5, which is 71 and older) the main issues were clearing exhaust and clearing the steering column. This required the steering column and shaft, with a ujoint, from an 80s Chevy Blazer. Exhaust required trial and error, then giving up, buying new headers that go over and outside the frame instead of hugging the block, and a little fender cutting. Then there was lining up the clutch linkage and making a custom floor section to go over the new transmission and tcase shifter locations. It actually looks nice and clean now (the swap, not the actual Jeep, lol) but it was a battle. Painless Wiring is a god send! I would have to do an LS swap, but I'd opted for an 80s Small block Chevy, then just convert it over to fuel injection."

If you get that much mud on the truck and take the time to power was the engine bay and undercarriage, there's no reason not to take a few minutes to at least get some of the mud off the truck. I know it's a little more than a few minutes (from my own experience), but he doesn't have to make it spotless.  Whether he power washes it or hoses it down and scrubs he'll be doing his paint job a huge favor. Even if he's going to get it detailed later it will still help.  So, basically because he's wining about problems with his truck that he could (and should) be preventing himself.  I don't agree with the downvotes, but it only has one more than upvotes currently (which probably means it has 1 d/v)."

4x4,3bd5vl,ChevroletAndIceCream,5,Sun Jun 28 02:32:20 2015 UTC,Why do I see so many people running around with a length of chain dangling from the front bumper? Would the noise not drive you crazy?

4x4,3b3ojk,pickle_meister,1 point,Thu Jun 25 23:45:57 2015 UTC,"If you have an automatic, be sure to do the radiator bypass mod to save your transmission.    If you go up in tire size, you will also need to melt-mod your fender liners.  Just warm them up with a heat gun and push those plastic liners back a bit on the rear section to prevent rubbing.  I used a sledge hammer head to remodel it a bit (not by hitting it, it was just the right shape).  There is tons of stuff you can do, but I would avoid spacer kits.  They often make things worse; I consider them to be a cosmetic mod.  Old Man Emu has some great kits, also check out PRG Products.  A rear bumper can add a lot of utility, I did my rear first and am only now getting to the front.  Being able to carry the spare, fuel or water, tools, jack, Trasharoo, etc. is really nice for overlanding."

4x4,3b7io8,Boon_saints,1 point,Sun Jun 28 02:01:50 2015 UTC,A lot of people like to have off road tires to be able to pull on rugged terrains without worrying about damaging their tires. It does not effect the way you pull the trailer at all.
4x4,3b38jp,1972super2110,5,Thu Jun 25 16:38:26 2015 UTC,I get why snorkels make sense on a diesel. But wouldnt the electronics fry on most gas engines before the snorkel became useful?
4x4,3b38jp,ellevehc,5,Thu Jun 25 18:47:43 2015 UTC,"That seems to be the common opinion on reddit as of late, but having driven my '83 CJ-7 and '13 JKUR through some fairly deep water (deep enough that water was detectable on the air filter) both engines got wet, and neither had anything electronic fried.  If I had a snorkel on either one, I wouldn't have had wet air filters.   Edit:  When you drive through water, you form a wave, just like anything else moving through water.  That wave can even occur inside the engine compartment, and be invisible to the driver.  When that wave fills the engine bay, you get water up near your intake, even though the water level may be a foot or two lower than that.  In situations like that, a snorkel would prevent your engine from sucking water from the wave."
4x4,3b38jp,PigSlam,2,Thu Jun 25 19:26:13 2015 UTC,Thats what its seems to be. Electronics especially on jeeps seem to be pretty water resistant and the snorkel keeps you from hydro locking. Ive got small traces of water in my jk from deep crossing which may be enough to justify a snorkel before I kill my engine.
4x4,3b38jp,bigtoedontknow,2,Thu Jun 25 19:32:25 2015 UTC,"So I have a diesel defender,  no electric components at all, how deep can I get? Like water over the hood?"
4x4,3b38jp,Ivan_TerraVagabundo,1 point,Thu Jun 25 22:03:44 2015 UTC,If you dont have a snorkel i would think you cant go past air intake. Theoretically i guess you could drive underwater with a tall enough snorkel

4x4,3b0kw4,you_know_how_I_know,4,Thu Jun 25 00:55:23 2015 UTC,"You have good taste, a duramax and solid front axle is a match made in heaven."
4x4,3b0kw4,OMGnanerpus,3,Thu Jun 25 01:10:31 2015 UTC,I agree! Should have came this way from the factory. Would have saved me a lot of trouble lol.

4x4,3b0kw4,Duramaximizer,2,Thu Jun 25 03:05:13 2015 UTC,Ford axle? I'm very very jealous but can't justify the cost of the swap.
4x4,3b0kw4,Duramaximizer,2,Thu Jun 25 04:17:36 2015 UTC,"Yes, 2007 Superduty Dana 60. Used all the stock stuff. Ford tie rod, drag link, steering stabilizer, brakes. Needed a conversion U-joint to use my factory GMC driveshaft and I used a Chevy drop pitman arm reamed for the Ford draglink.  I can get anything that is designed to wear out from any auto parts store. The only custom stuff that would need to be ordered are the heims / end links on the track bar and radius arms. And the coilovers."

4x4,3b0kw4,luckybone,1 point,Thu Jun 25 14:00:37 2015 UTC,"Dana 60 Kingpin HP would be nice. I DD my duramax so I wouldn't be able to do the swap, let alone the cost. Not sure when but my 85 is passenger."
4x4,3b0kw4,BlokeInTheMountains,2,Thu Jun 25 17:44:58 2015 UTC,"I considered using a kingpin D60 but decided against it because of the brakes / ABS.   WFO sells some brackets to mount the duramax brakes and ABS on the kingpin D60, but it still takes significant machining that I did not want to deal with.   I DD my truck as well. I just made damn sure I had everything I needed before I started tearing anything apart.  The swap only took 4 days. I just took off work for a long weekend.   It's cheaper than you think. I could have done this swap for well under 2000 bucks using slightly different components. Including the axle (350 from the junk yard)"
4x4,3b0kw4,Turbo_unicorn,1 point,Thu Jun 25 14:44:03 2015 UTC,"That's impressive. I didn't realize it could be done so cheap and retain most of the ford parts. Now you have me thinking! You must have had to get a different yoke for the transfer case, no? Now that the axle will droop I would think it could pull the stock yoke right out of the transfer case since it's set up for IFS. How's the ride? I've had to put a new rear axle in my truck and the 11.5"" AAM cost me $600 from a junk yard... hard to get stuff in Canada cheaply."

4x4,3ayc3f,ShinyCrayfish,3,Wed Jun 24 17:25:52 2015 UTC,"They are very cool trucks. Of the period, the G60 Patrol's probably are the most durable (compared to the FJ/SIIA Landrover/Scout/CJ/Bronco) with the strongest drivetrain.  Given they are much less common in Australia than the FJ's/Landrovers of similar era, and their reputation, they have become quite collectible here."
4x4,3ayc3f,Flys_Lo,3,Wed Jun 24 23:19:40 2015 UTC,That's a nice old rig there.  Only criticism is the tire/wheel choice.

4x4,3azamh,BeerRunner77,1 point,Wed Jun 24 21:41:46 2015 UTC,"Use raptor liner. It is by far the best diy bedliner that I know of. Herculiner and rustolium are way to rubbery. Since its a diy, you can always touch up."

4x4,3aztd3,Flextime,1 point,Wed Jun 24 20:46:42 2015 UTC,"This trail is not too hard. I've seen plenty of stock rigs on it.   Done it a few times on AT tires.  There used to be a gatekeeper step in the first 100ft. If you made it up that then you were good. But it's gone now, I think they even paved that part.  Elephant hill itself is really pretty easy. It's just steep and narrow.  There are 2 or 3 parts where you either have to do 3 point turn on the switch back or reverse down the next section (signs direct you to do this and it's not hard).  Make sure your descent technique is good. Try not to pulse the brakes.  I don't need a spotter on any of this trail but it might be a good idea in some spots. Check that no one is coming up before starting the descents.  Once you are over Elephant Hill there rest is pretty straight forward. Be prepared for the squeeze rock which may be tight in a LC.  Devils kitchen is a great camp spot.  You can drive out to the joint and to the confluence of the rivers.  No need for a winch or high lift. I doubt you would get stuck, but you will see other off roaders out there if you need a tug. Worst case is a 5 mile hike back to the trail head. Most tourists do the few mile hike to the joint.  Last time out I rescued a guy in a Jeep that was towing an off road camp trailer. He had no lockers and had high centered himself by taking a stupid line and the trailer was limiting his options.  I think this was just before Devil's kitchen.  http://i.imgur.com/q3WJhMV.jpg  Take lots of water."

4x4,3aztd3,BlokeInTheMountains,1 point,Thu Jun 25 02:49:51 2015 UTC,Forgot to add that there is a tiny general store out there at the edge of the NP.  You can get fuel and water and even take a shower there.  I think I paid like $6 a gallon for fuel there once.  So probably better to fill up in Moab or Monticello as well as bring a few gallons in a jerrycan.  Also surrounding the NP is BLM land where you can camp and there is plenty of trails. When we go out there we usually don't even try to get a campsite in the park. We just go straight to Hamburger rocks on the BLM and camp away from people.  Canyonlands is probably my favorite NP. Enjoy.
4x4,3aztd3,Motheroftheworld,1 point,Thu Jun 25 13:54:12 2015 UTC,"My family drove Elephant Hill several times in a stock FJ80 (1993 version) and we did it without damage on Michelin all terrain tires (can't remember what they were since that was a number of years ago. The wing mirrors had to be pulled in for some areas but, really doable. The area where you ""Pull forward, Back down"" seems a bit daunting but, read the signs and drive carefully and you will be fine. Like BlokeInTheMountains said take lots of water. Water for each person and water (just in case, you never know) for the vehicle. I figure you cannot have too much water in Utah. Have a great trip and enjoy a beautiful area of the state."

4x4,3awtcp,you_know_how_I_know,1 point,Wed Jun 24 15:14:59 2015 UTC,Toyota mini truck axle approximately equal to a Dana 44.  Dana 44 RCV:  http://www.rcvperformance.com/product-details-axles.aspx?sku=CVJ44-JK  $1185.  RCV for Toyota mini:  http://www.rcvperformance.com/product-details.aspx?sku=CVJ2851-PU  $645.  Assume approximately similar amount of material.  Yet half the price for the Toyota RCV. Why? Probably because TG is selling Birfs for ~$600.  Competition is good. Without TG I would expect RCV to raise the birf price to match the Dana 44 price.

4x4,3awtcp,rockfrawg,1 point,Wed Jun 24 13:18:05 2015 UTC,I want Nate's bumper in a bad way! Winch with no brush bar? That is the best looking aftermarket front that I've seen -- it has all the utility without any of the stuff that mars the Yota's pretty face.
4x4,3awtcp,BlokeInTheMountains,1 point,Mon Jun 29 12:37:01 2015 UTC,He made that himself. I'd rather have the bull bar. You can see that not having it has cost him his front fender.
4x4,3awtcp,rockfrawg,1 point,Mon Jun 29 13:06:47 2015 UTC,"If I weren't 3000 miles away and he wanted to upgrade, I would be knocking on his door daily to haggle.  It looks to me like the fender took a direct scrape at the front of the wheel well and that a bull bar would have been irrelevant. Was it a front impact? Having just replaced a fender on my 84 a couple months ago, I have to say that the driver's side replacement is easy to get but a clean passenger side is a rare animal indeed."
4x4,3awtcp,MaxDerps,3,Mon Jun 29 13:21:36 2015 UTC,I have the weirdest boner right now
4x4,3awtcp,BlokeInTheMountains,3,Wed Jun 24 14:37:18 2015 UTC,Its called a Toyota boner. Once you get one you'll never be happy with anything else.

4x4,3awtcp,markalicouss,2,Wed Jun 24 06:51:05 2015 UTC,"What are your thoughts on running a larger/ stronger front 9.5"" iirc compared to the rear 8.0"" ring gears? The 8"" is pretty strong, but the LC axle is beef."
4x4,3awtcp,markalicouss,2,Wed Jun 24 13:10:17 2015 UTC,Its funny you say that. The guy's truck you see more towards the bottom of the driveway is doing an SAS and this is what he is using for a front axle : http://oppiz.net/pics/4runner/06212015/20150621_205149.jpg    FJ60 axle! It is the perfect width to pair with an IFS wide track rear end so you don't have to run spacers. It just requires some relocation of spring perches and other small things. It is definitely what I wish I could have gone with but I didn't have the money and they are tough to find.
4x4,3awtcp,Koadster,2,Wed Jun 24 13:21:59 2015 UTC,"I guess I did not answer your question. There is no doubt that a 9.5"" axle is immensely stronger. That is not to take anything away from a Toyota 8"" axle. Toyota 8"" axles have been a staple of wheelers for over 30 years and hold up to a lot. Especially when they are trussed (84 and 85 have the longest lower factory truss) and gusseted like you see on mine. When you combine that with Chromoly axles, quality ring gear (I went a step further and got mine cryoed), and quality hub gears you have a very strong axle."
4x4,3awtcp,01hair,2,Wed Jun 24 13:32:40 2015 UTC,"Yep, everything on the mini truck axles can be upgraded but that 8"" R&P.  So the practical limit is around 37"" tires and not too throttle happy.  The problem with the LC axles is that they are hard to find and expensive.  For about the same money you can usually find domestic 1-ton axles.  They are of course full width, which can be good and bad.  Good:   Width is great for stability. Reduces chance of rollover. Heavy: down low weight also enhances trail stability and reduces rollover. Practically unlimited large tire size with some upgrades on these light Toyotas More locker options. 14 bolts come in Full Float flavours. Super strong with extra pinion bearing.   Bad:   You give up your 6-lug pattern. New wheels needed. Wheels will be sticking far outside the guards. No removal 3rd member makes gear setup more of a pain. Heavy. A set 1-ton axles weigh ~1,000 lbs Clearance - bigger pumpkins means you need to run ~40"" tires before you start to see any clearance benefit over Toyota axles on 37s. Your weak point moves to your t-case outputs. Breaking a R&P is one thing. Breaking a t-case output is another."
4x4,3awtcp,Koadster,1 point,Wed Jun 24 14:01:06 2015 UTC,"LoL...this is the first time I've read that weak point moves to the t-case outputs. I always assumed it would be the u-joints, and I was right the first two times, but after replacing really old u-joints, t-case is exactly where my weak point identified itself.  I sheered off the rear output.  Spot on sir.  http://i.imgur.com/AHH5CaR.jpg  Replacement parts are not financially viable to rebuild it, and it took me months of passive looking to locate a reasonably priced used t-case in my area.  Hopefully the replacement will last long enough until I can justify Atlas money in the budget.  Before and after build pic:  http://i.imgur.com/BcvBBBV.jpg"

Oh i know there capable...... but jve also seen one have to reverse 2kms because the was nowhere for it to turn around on the tight tracks"
4x4,3apw2v,Flys_Lo,1 point,Tue Jun 23 02:13:15 2015 UTC,"I only ask - because that is where I am from. I regularly take my F250 up to the high country, and it's turning circle isn't much larger than my friends Defender 90 that I also go offroad with, and similar to my Courier too.  Mine is a later model with coil front springs however - the older ones (2001-2007) with leaf front springs do have a really bad turning circle, but a lot of the thoughts about them being poor off-road or using lots of fuel (both of which are comments I regularly get) are just misconceptions."
4x4,3apw2v,Koadster,3,Tue Jun 23 03:04:18 2015 UTC,Ah right fair enough. Yea this was an 05 model and on 37s so it had the turning circle of a mack truck.  Really i thought they would have been shocking on fuel. Especially with that massive engine.   Either way doesn't matter what you drive its a beautiful place up there
4x4,3apw2v,Flys_Lo,1 point,Tue Jun 23 08:20:32 2015 UTC,Ha. On 37's it will chew thru the juice! But I can eek out 11l/100km on the hwy empty. Mines on stock 34 tyres though.  It is a very beautiful place.

4x4,3apw2v,Kiwibaconator,0,Tue Jun 23 08:51:59 2015 UTC,Video please. I have doubts a F250 can do some of the tighter tracks.  How does it handle steep decents which turn into steep acsents such as some creek crossings. Id imagine youd bottom out trying to get out of them.
4x4,3apw2v,Flys_Lo,1 point,Tue Jun 23 10:47:21 2015 UTC,"I'll aim to get some video next time I am out.  It actually works really well on both ascents and descents as the longer wheelbase puts the rear wheels further back behind where the Landcruiser/Patrols have dug out ruts.  Its primary downfall is its turning circle (which is about equal to many other larger vehicles) and the longer wheelbase/side steps over drains. I also don't have a winch/bar for it, so if/when it gets stuck, my mates are going to have fun getting me out."

4x4,3apw2v,Kiwibaconator,2,Tue Jun 23 08:25:26 2015 UTC,Its not really significantly wider than a 200 series Landcruiser in my experience.
4x4,3apw2v,Flys_Lo,2,Tue Jun 23 08:29:13 2015 UTC,That would be true.  But the 200 is a whale and bigger than most would offroad with outside a desert or beach.

I think it looks kinda cool and it also serves the purpose of deflecting more sun heat than a darker color. Besides, it's the roof. You could probably paint it yourself with acceptable results with a cheap paint setup in that garage.   That's what I would do. Sweet 60, BTW :)   Edit: I see a bit of cancer starting on that dog leg. That's always the first spot to go on the 60 Series. I would get on that ASAP, even if it means you have to touch that area up. Is that a factory color? I've seen blue 60's before, but I can't tell if yours has been resprayed."

4x4,3ag7ns,bigtoedontknow,2,Fri Jun 19 23:07:12 2015 UTC,"If you can get the paint code, a body supply shop should be able to mix you a spray can that you should be able to use to touch that up. I bet if you buffed it properly after the fact, most people wouldn't be able to tell. If your truck was more beat up, I might suggest something like a Monstaliner coating on the lower part, as 60's have a natural line that can be used to make it look pretty alright.   Paint should be done last, after you have the mechanicals and electricals sorted the way you want, but in your case, I think I would really try to salvage the paint you have. I like the white roof and by having the rain gutters as a natural paint break, painting that part separate would be pretty simple. Chrome and white go well with blue."

I drive a 2wd Tacoma now and I would buy another Land Cruiser, if the price was right, but they've gotten so expensive and most of the ones I could afford are either rust buckets, or the interiors are just hammered.   Where you live, finding trucks like yours is possible. Where I live, I know or have seen all of the Land Cruisers and I just can't justify buying a rusty one. Been there, done that.

4x4,3absg9,BlokeInTheMountains,3,Fri Jun 19 02:54:27 2015 UTC,The TRD Pro 4Runner is an amazingly capable machine. Probably more so than an FJ40.
4x4,3absg9,jeepmb,9,Thu Jun 18 22:10:50 2015 UTC,"I agree, i like the newer design techniques for frames, bodies and engines with light weight like toyota did with the new 4runner. They made a bold look that will be remembered in the future, provides solid body/ground angles for an OEM build. The modern chassis are so much more resistant to vibration, flex, and rust that I would put them up against old for driving confidence, speed, and reliability on and off road. Also just more comfortable to drive!  BUT I do strongly believe in the benefits of crude simple design. When old parts are stressed outside of the parameters they were designed for (like being winched out of a gultch over fallen trees and logs), old cast iron and steel handle the stresses better. Bent or chipped components are OK and easily repairable in the field with ample working room and simple tools. Electrics are basic, components are easy to repair or bypass, and can even be modified to limp home when compensating for other systems. Engines, transmissions, t-cases, and axles in old rigs can be equally crude and robust.   On the trail, too often overlooked by modern SUV's is the concept of WHEN it breaks down. Be it accident, driver error, breakdown, or nature, you travel the backroads enough and know something always will break eventually. I want the one I can fix quickly now, 5 years from now, 20 years from now, even if I have to open the hood more in between."
4x4,3absg9,BlokeInTheMountains,1 point,Thu Jun 18 22:33:27 2015 UTC,"No doubt. Simple is often easier and more reliable.  However, I think we're nearing the point where we can look at the technology and say: ""this is getting pretty reliable.""  Remember when carbureted engines were the only engines that were reliable? And EFI was some weird black magic not to be trusted?  But EFI is pretty much accepted as the norm. I tend to think solid axles are the place to be, but IFS has come a long way and the advances they are making in terms of materials and manufacturing are so widespread that I'm beginning to think it's okay to have technology on the trail.   I mean, who here has done the Pan-American highway? Or from London to Pakistan? Or a trip across Aus? Or the Mojave Road?  I've done Mojave road, which is pretty isolated. I did it in my 11 JK, which, according to most guys, has too many bells and whistles to be reliable on the trail. But I was fine.   My point is that we typically run trails that have trailheads on graded or paved roads and we wheel in groups or with buddies. We should never be stranded on a trail if the IFS breaks somehow."
4x4,3absg9,You_chose_wrong,8,Thu Jun 18 23:16:52 2015 UTC,"Technology only improves in the direction it's pointed.  In modern times, that is in the direction of on road ability and better MPG.  I have seen a Jeep dead on the trail because an unseen small stick/rock came up and knocked a hole in the lower tank on the radiator. Because they are plastic. Kinda hard to fix on the trail.  Meanwhile my heavy 20 year old brass radiator would have laughed it off. When it leaks I can point a flame at it and some solder and fix it up.  Which would you rather when crossing the Australian outback and your life depended on it?"

4x4,3absg9,L8sho,2,Fri Jun 19 00:33:32 2015 UTC,I think the point is even with 1k in mods you don't scratch the surface if the TRD 4runners price.  Although 1k would go a lot further towards upgrading leaf sprung solid suspension as opposed to IFS and coil sprung(?) SRA.

Throw $1k at the TRDP, and all you will get is either a front locker, or a little bit of lift, with no appreciable articulation.   $1k in the FJ will get you two Aussies and some revolver shackles, which will bring with it a drastic improvement.   Edit:   And anyway, since the TRDP is being made in limited numbers, the resale value and vehicle appreciation will most certainly improve.   Right. I hope you aren't a financial advisor. Find me a stock Rubicon or TRD (anything) that sold for more than the new retail price, a few years down the road.  I'm not sure why you seem so butthurt.

So to comment to that guy, no, I'd want the TRD Pronto the drive to the trail and then the trail, too. I have no need for a 40 year old or older leaf sprung, lawnmower motor on a trail.

You can't really crawl well in a 2wd, and because of this you'll be relying on momentum to get over obstacles, which can cause damage. You can make a 2wd into one hell of a prerunner with loads of suspension travel, but trying to do more difficult trails in a 2wd is like rock climbing without arms, and even with a locker you don't have anything up front to pull your heavy vehicle up over an obstacle. Great read though, thanks for sharing."

The people you talked to all had interest in selling lockers, ARB is well known for pushing their overpriced items.   My Isuzu went off road a lot before it had a locker, and it was great. It came down to picking my lines and being careful not to push it into a position it did not belong. Adding a locker mean it could crawl easier and I could be a bit more reckless with what I did.   The locker added peace of mind in sticky situations, but it was not absolutely needed.   A nice tight LSD helps as well, the rear LSD works great.  Its important to know the capabilities of your 2WD or 4WD before you ever go ""off road""  Also talk to Zuk owners, they are so light Lockers are nice, but wow they go far without them."

4x4,3abm1d,L8sho,3,Fri Jun 19 01:21:49 2015 UTC,"Sorry, wrong thread. I was arguing with a moron elsewhere.  A locked 2wd can potentially still have one driven rear tire with traction while lifting a rear tire. You can get a vehicle crossed up where you have one front and one rear off the ground, rendering the 4x4 with open diffs immobile.   The open diff 4x4 wins when the rear tires can't find traction, but both of the front tires can."
4x4,3abm1d,Kiwibaconator,5,Fri Jun 19 01:24:17 2015 UTC,A 4x4 has to be perfectly balanced to lose traction on both ends.  Normally one end will pick up a wheel (like the uphill end) and the downhill end is still driving with both.

4x4,3abm1d,lukefwjross,12,Fri Jun 19 01:26:21 2015 UTC,One other thing that needs mentioned is weight distribution.  A 2wd pickup truck can get stuck on a grassy lawn because all the weight is on the wrong end.  Where a 2wd beetle with the engine over the wheels can go amazing places.  Particularly in sand and snow.

That way you can wheel it near stock to get the nuances of the vehicle down. Always wheel your rig stock first, so you know its capabilities.   I've never encountered a 2wd Jeep on any trails here in Colorado, unless you count when things have broken. I think a lot of people aren't really well educated on how capable a stock Jeep can be. I see lots of stockers up in the mountains and besides some fairly gnarly obstacles, they do pretty well.   In fact, overbuilt rigs here get laughed at more than regular joes with a few mods. Guys who drop $5k on suspension upgrades and don't know what half the components are, or how to field repair them are more irksome to me than guys in stock Jeeps having some fun.

Many serious offroading rigs wouldn't have one because they're built only for pulling their own weight  but you should never winch or tow strap from one because it could break off and fly at the recovery vehicle.

4x4,3a8jc5,Swiss_Army_Penis,0,Sat Jun 20 02:27:52 2015 UTC,It's called a stinger and intended to let the front end ride up and over obstacles.   But 90 %  of people building bumpers with them weld them on too far back so the front face will catch on any obstacle.  Totally missing the function and leaving them ornamental only.

What I had in mind for the project was swapping in a Cummins 4bt, but those are heavy and it now it seems that would be a bad idea.    I currently have an '86 K5 Blazer (M1009 CUCV) with a 6.2L diesel.  I have no idea how many miles are on that engine even though the odometer reads 53K miles, because who knows what happened while it was with the military.  I feel like something is off with it, but I'm a diesel beginner so learning as I go.    With that said, it's not worth fixing if the engine goes, it'd be better just to swap a 4bt in it and keep it.  The other option would be to throw an LS 5.3L or 6.0L in it and go nuts, because it is federally emission exempt, and then sell it.  This is why I started looking at the FJ's because I'm really keen on having a diesel wheeler."

4x4,39ut4e,weeder57,5,Mon Jun 15 23:14:59 2015 UTC,"I dont go by mileage, i go by the hour, anywhere from 5 gallons an hour to 12-13 if im working her hard."
4x4,39ut4e,ReptilianOver1ord,2,Mon Jun 15 23:58:28 2015 UTC,Big diesels are usually measured by operating hour. I used to work on Tugboats. We measured fuel in hundreds of gallons of fuel per hour while towing.
4x4,39ut4e,weeder57,2,Tue Jun 16 21:42:14 2015 UTC,"Well everything we do in alaska up here is in hours. Mileage doesnt matter, whether it be a diesel pickup or a d10 dozer. The trucking companies dont even use mileage per gallons, they do everything by the hour."

4x4,39ut4e,r9we290xnow,6,Mon Jun 15 12:23:47 2015 UTC,"Actually, the front tires are the backwards ones. The main reason I know of tires in opposite directions like that is to rock back and forth in the mud. The five tons are impossible to get stuck because they can rock back and forth so well."
4x4,39ut4e,avid_novice,2,Mon Jun 15 16:42:23 2015 UTC,"Isn't the point of the directional tire to self clean, though?"
4x4,39ut4e,RyEnd,2,Mon Jun 15 17:06:39 2015 UTC,No.... The point of a directional tire is to dig in and get traction. I think you are talking about how a street mud/snow tire is designed to push out the stuff from underneath it in order to get traction.
4x4,39ut4e,snotrokit,1 point,Mon Jun 15 17:11:53 2015 UTC,Then why are tractor tires all mounted the same direction as every other directional tire?
4x4,39ut4e,avid_novice,6,Mon Jun 15 17:23:35 2015 UTC,Because tractors are only meant to pull in one direction. Forward.
4x4,39ut4e,PigSlam,2,Mon Jun 15 19:19:54 2015 UTC,"Not quite impossible.  Takes work, talent, or some really bad luck."

4x4,39ut4e,Jonny_Challenger,5,Mon Jun 15 13:11:15 2015 UTC,Duh.  The back tires are supposed to be mounted that way.    Front tires -> Frontwards  Back tires -> Backwards
4x4,39ut4e,Jonny_Challenger,2,Mon Jun 15 14:53:26 2015 UTC,Don't you mean:  Back tires <- Backwards

Unfortuantly you are going into this with an almost non-existant budget. Ultimately you have to decide whats more important - travel to and from work, or going camping.  For your budget I would look at an import (4 runner or land cruiser) as they last much longer than most of the vehicles that are available for that price.  Your other option is a pickup - you can buy used trucks all day long at that price, throw on a camper shell and parts are dirt cheap."

When you get up to about $5k-$7500 price range you start getting lots of inflated prices due to the increased demand for offroad vehicles. This means he will pay quite a bit for not a lot of a vehicle.  The diesel truck market and import tuner market is the same as well. You can find a massive POS that has 2 dead cylinders and a blown trans go for outrageous amounts of money.   By sticking with less known/modded vehicles the chances of getting more for your money increases.  Don't get me wrong - mechanically they are good, but its a hyper-inflated market."

4x4,39o1jf,Tim_Teboner,2,Sat Jun 13 04:13:25 2015 UTC,"I own a 2007 Xterra OffRoad (precursor to Pro4X) and a 2004 4Runner V8, so I can given an unbiased opinion on both.    The 4Runner is amazingly comfortable and great as a daily driver.  The rear seats have a ton of legroom and it's easy to get in and out of.  With a V8 it has plenty of horsepower and torque... and I absolutely love the full-time 4x4 system for daily driving.  Here in Texas we get torrential rainstorms like I've never seen elsewhere, and the traction I have is awesome.  When we get that once a year ice storm, no worries about if it's slick enough for 4H, it's always on.  Now offroad it has good enough ground clearance stock and I've never gotten stuck, but it's never felt as nimble as the X on trails.  With some modifications I'm sure I can make it just as capable, but as a stock vehicle I'd be hesitant to take it on some of the same trails as the X.  The X wasn't bad as a daily driver... much more comfortable than other trucks I tried like a Wrangler or Liberty.  The back seat is really difficult for adults to navigate with it being right over the wheel.  The interior feels cheap compared to the 4Runner, it's not horrible, but not my favorite.  On the road it rides nicely, but with ATs in the rain it was always a bit squirrely (tried 3 different tires over the years with similar results).  Offroad it's always been a champ... never got stuck.  I never needed to use the locking diff, but it's always good to have.  I took it on some pretty wicked trails near Ouray, CO and it didn't flinch.    Maintenance-wise they have both been fantastic... no major issues, only routine preventative maintenance apart from replacing the radiator on the X to avoid the known leaking problem which can kill the transmission.  Wasn't seeing issues, but didn't want to risk it either."
4x4,39o1jf,Tim_Teboner,3,Tue Jun 16 21:23:12 2015 UTC,"The 4 runner has become too bloated in my opinion. I highly considered a frontier or tacoma, but I've always preferred suv's. It was also cool that I got the last year the xterras are made. It was everything I was looking for."
4x4,39o1jf,Tim_Teboner,8,Sat Jun 13 04:33:14 2015 UTC,"Only compared to other 4runners. The 4runner and Xterra are within a  hundred pounds of each other and ony 3 inches dif in width... The 4runner is a touch longer, not by much though. The xterra is a nice rig though enjoy!"
4x4,39o1jf,mango-roller,3,Sat Jun 13 05:26:15 2015 UTC,The new 4runners are very similarly sized to a 3rd gen.
4x4,39o1jf,mango-roller,2,Sat Jun 13 14:37:50 2015 UTC,"It was a little too big in my opinion. Don't get me wrong I love 4runners, we used to have a gen 1 back in the day. It just wasn't what I was looking for."
4x4,39o1jf,You_chose_wrong,3,Sat Jun 13 17:24:44 2015 UTC,"The new 4runner is just barely bigger than the 2015 xterra. The early 5th generation 4runners were indeed bloated, but they've shrunk back down to a reasonable size for an offroad SUV."
4x4,39o1jf,You_chose_wrong,2,Sat Jun 13 17:27:31 2015 UTC,"That would explain it then, I actually didn't look at 2015 4runners because I'm not a fan of the front design ha-ha. I looked at the 4th gens."
4x4,39o1jf,Well_thats_cool,3,Sat Jun 13 17:34:40 2015 UTC,"4th gens (early ones at least) were still relatively small. For about 3-4 years 4runners got obnoxiously large, but luckily they slimmed down again in the last two years."
4x4,39o1jf,baldwadc,2,Sat Jun 13 18:15:36 2015 UTC,So Nissan just won't be making Xterras for 2016 and beyond? Or do you mean that there will just be a new gen in 2016?

So far Nissan has no plans to replace it with a body on frame vehicle. It's being canceled because of its poor sales, due to its poor gas mileage, and truck like ride...

4x4,39o1jf,Echo_one,8,Sat Jun 13 19:28:48 2015 UTC,I think the 4-runner will be the best bet.  Personally I think the grand Cherokee is becoming more of a luxury suv. I don't really see them as heavy duty off-roader. The trd pro is a very capable off-roader.

4x4,39l52m,Vagicles,6,Fri Jun 12 21:11:41 2015 UTC,I've seen more buried diesels than any other vehicle. Those bitches are front heavy so they sink extremely quickly. I can't do much for them either since my ZJ is pretty much a ton lighter so they get to stay stuck if I'm the only rig in the area.
4x4,39l52m,the_native,3,Sat Jun 13 01:13:25 2015 UTC,"That's a half ton though so it should have independent front suspension still and I believe the new Eco diesel is relatively small, something like 3.4L turbo."

With all that, it'll dig a hole if 4-Low with the quickness.  OPs yota weighs as much as a fart, is a manual with tall gears, and doesn't have nearly as much torque. That's why 4-Low works well for her."

Didn't catch anything of note, the biggest fish was a 14"" Grey Sea Trout.  Caught a bunch of small dogfish, small flounder and small sheepshead.

I was describing to my wife while we were driving in our '13 JKUR back from Moab that I'd love to do half of a JK-8 conversion, but have a soft top for the back.  That way, I've have the option to remove the top, or have it on, but I could still have my dogs and cargo with me, and covered (if I needed to).  Yesterday is when I realized from some other post that soft tops for those things are a thing, and that's pretty close to what I'd turn my JKU into if money were no object, and I'd solved all the other problems in my life."

I ended up throwing it in reverse while I was winching and it worked fabulously.  The winch did overheat at the very last second when I was spooling the line back on, with only 3 feet left to go.  We got lucky."

4x4,39l52m,jballen5,4,Fri Jun 12 16:45:23 2015 UTC,"I really didn't have that much line out, and I think it would have overheated no matter the amount of rows of line I had out.  That was a heavy truck and it was VERY stuck."

4x4,39l52m,Gnatshit,3,Sat Jun 13 03:00:46 2015 UTC,"Should have used a snatch block to pull that much weight, run the line through the snatch, attach it to their tow point with a shackle, loop the line back to your vehicle and attach it to a front recovery point."

A lot of people with other Jeep models modify their doors to do the same.  But then again, why not?  The breeze is quite nice when on the road and while off roading it gives you a great view of the trail."

4x4,39hw96,diablo_man,3,Fri Jun 12 10:46:55 2015 UTC,Have you ever noticed how much twisting you get from the body with the doors off? It's a uni-body so there's no frame that the body rides on. I've been riding in my friends Cherokee while 4 wheeling with the doors on and you can feel it twisting.
4x4,39hw96,thegalli,3,Fri Jun 12 12:53:42 2015 UTC,"Haven't had time to take it on a trail since I had them pulled off. Around town though I don't notice anything. And honestly idk if I'll wheel it with the doors off because of that twisting theory. They've gotta go back on this winter so if they twist too much it'll be bad, cold news lol."

4x4,39iysa,stephen217,6,Fri Jun 12 01:22:36 2015 UTC,The geometry of traction bars has to be right to stop excessive squat or antisquat.   Otherwise your rig will start humping rocks instead of climbing over them.  Pirate 4x4 had good squat calculators. But I've never used them.

4x4,39gvg5,LtBenben,12,Thu Jun 11 17:07:21 2015 UTC,I would say pick up a cheap beater 4x4 and join a local club to have fun. You will learn so much and not have to worry about abusing it. You don't need to have a ton of $$ with all the best parts to have fun. I would suggest to start with a bronco or Cherokee because they are a lot less than a jeep. Build up your skills and with experience you will know what you like/want/need when the time comes to drop the $$ on a nicer newer 4x4. Save the escape for your daily driver.
4x4,39gvg5,Boogge,3,Thu Jun 11 18:08:29 2015 UTC,"As much as I would like to do that, unfortunately, thats not really an option. I'm going to community college and don't that have the space or money to get another car."
4x4,39gvg5,stabzmcgee,15,Thu Jun 11 19:00:32 2015 UTC,"Think about that when wanting to take your daily driver on the trail. Can you afford to lose your current daily driver? Then don't take it on any trails that anything bad can happen.  Not that you will lose/damage it, but its a possability when going off highway."

4x4,39gvg5,ChickenKickin,4,Fri Jun 12 20:04:31 2015 UTC,"Dirt roads, trade it in haha. Sorry I dont have too much ecoerience with escapes."
4x4,39gvg5,iwasinthepool,2,Fri Jun 12 20:40:10 2015 UTC,"Sounds like your best option would be to trade/sell and buy a slightly older 4x4 that has an off-roading pedigree. Idk what the blue book value on the Escape is but you could probably get a good truck/SUV for the same money. Save some money, fix it up a bit, get some all terrain tires and find a logging road (or whatever you have where you live). Just don't do anything crazy for now."
4x4,39gvg5,iwasinthepool,6,Thu Jun 18 04:07:15 2015 UTC,"OME makes a 1.75"" lift for it, for a decent price. I would start there, and maybe get a slightly larger tire under it. That will give you a couple extra inches of clearance. That will be a good start. I don't really know much about the Escape, but I think it's a full time awd with independent front and rear suspension. You're basically looking to off-road a Forester. You aren't going to get many places with it, but you'll get much farther than if it were stock."
4x4,39gvg5,SnuffThePunkz,2,Thu Jun 11 17:28:49 2015 UTC,"Any recommendation as to what to do stock? I'd like to try before i buy, so to speak.  And its not full time awd"
4x4,39gvg5,gatogrande,3,Thu Jun 11 17:41:37 2015 UTC,"Well, you should be able to do any dirt roads and stuff. I've seen some Subarus get pretty far down since trails. I would imagine you have about the same clearance."
4x4,39gvg5,EinsteinRidesShotgun,2,Thu Jun 11 18:13:48 2015 UTC,"My wife has a 01 4cyl/5speed that we put 30's under it.  It's fairly capable, no real complaints other that when I had to rebuild the transaxle, we are looking at the OME lift some time this year.  Nothing crazy, but it has some better clearance. Watch out for the carrier bearing though, it hangs low and can easily take a blow.  http://imgur.com/a/1Jf4S  With the lift and some trimming, I'm thinking it'll clear 32-33"" tires."
4x4,39gvg5,pyroboy101,5,Thu Jun 11 19:45:40 2015 UTC,"Hate to be the bearer of bad news, but your Escape was never meant to be an offroader....Isn't it labeled a ""softroader"" by the car mags?  It gives the perception of ruggedness, but is best suited for commuting on lightly snow covered roads, gravel driveways, forest service roads, etc.  You're gonna start breaking things otherwise.  On the plus side, it prolly zips down the highway nicely, quiet and comfortable with decent mileage"
4x4,39gvg5,sirtjapkes,2,Fri Jun 12 14:03:51 2015 UTC,"Nicely, yes. Quietly, not so much; as soon as I get over 55-60, its started to get a little noisy. Mileage wise its meh, I get around 215-225 per tank."
4x4,39gvg5,pyroboy101,4,Fri Jun 12 17:32:29 2015 UTC,You can't offroad an Escape.
4x4,39gvg5,4lowgo,3,Sat Jun 13 23:39:33 2015 UTC,"Something to be aware of on the Ford Escapes is that the alternator is on the bottom side of the engine behind the passenger side tire. I fried mine going through a stream last year. I'm pretty sure it was about to go anyway, but it's still something you want to be aware of. Other than that, it did just fine in the mud and rain in Northern Arizona."

You'll be fine on gravel/dirt roads but once things get rocky or the tracks get rutted out you'll probably get stuck or break something.   however there's lots of folks at /r/battlewagon who wheel the shit out of their Subarus.

4x4,39ftjz,Kiwibaconator,6,Fri Jun 12 08:48:47 2015 UTC,"Whole lot of bitching in here, but the global Ranger platform is a solid performer and is competing with the Navara and Hilux overseas.  The only reason it isn't in the states is because it would compete against the F-150 in most aspects and Ford is not as interested in competing with Jeep or the Tacoma for off road use.  The F-150 is already beating the midsize market in hauling and towing and the new aluminum chassis only makes it compare more favorably in the MPG tests."

Bilstein shocks front/rear and new rear leafs, bushings, shackles, and bolts.   While i was doing the rear i went ahead and did the ZUK mod.

4x4,39cle5,SubcommanderMarcos,2,Thu Jun 11 04:17:38 2015 UTC,"Yeah but now you're missing a whole wheel and assembly, and there's like a creek underneath the car, how do you pull it out without messing it up a lot more?

There is a pretty good risk of more damage or increasing the severity of preexisting damage. We'll run chain around something structural (harder to find on these cross overs than true SUVs) and pull it out with hydraulic winches and steel cable.  The real shit is that if the driver was simply stupid and has full coverage, we will be paid. If it is under criminal investigation, it may be sitting in our yard for a long time before we get paid."

4x4,39cle5,dirty_hooker,3,Thu Jun 11 07:16:50 2015 UTC,"No, not exactly.  Though we try to limit further damage, it is in the nature of the beast. We didn't put the vehicle in that predicament but we are tasked (often by law enforcement) to remove it. To get it out of that spot will likely involve hooking to the rear and pulling it out which may cause damage when the front end drops or as it drags over the rocks that it likely flew over when it went down. From there you would spin it around and chain the busted end to the stinger. Since it is AWD you'll have to use dollies to elevate the rear axle and protect the transaxle. Even if it is totaled it will make a big difference in how it tracks behind and that transaxle is worth money to the scrap yard. If the trail is too rough for dollies then you'd have to pull the driveshaft. If it's a long way from home, you might do that just for the ease of towing.  /r/hookit"

The really high horse and expensive rigs run 4 wheel disc brakes, to get rid of the chatter.

There is also the GM 2.5t which is ford 9 inch style, and still retains the same shafts and housing just is turned 90 degrees. Then there is old school 2.5t rockwells which are again ford 9 inch style, then there are F106 axles, which use the same style of housing, but are almost the exact same as a ford 9 inch except is way bigger and also come in front varietys too. There are more but they are very uncommon. Most deuces from the late 50s till the mid 2000s came with them. Then there are 5 ton rocks, 10 tons, planetaries, and lots more."
4x4,39eyok,weeder57,3,Thu Jun 11 14:40:07 2015 UTC,"Sorry but what do you mean by ""top loader?"""
4x4,39eyok,DeepSouthTJ,3,Thu Jun 11 15:09:18 2015 UTC,The drive shaft connect on the top of the axle instead of the front face.
4x4,39eyok,Boogge,3,Thu Jun 11 17:54:45 2015 UTC,"The drive flange is up top, horizontal, which drives a ring and pinion up top, which then runs a bull gear, its called double reduction. So you have 4 gears vs 2 gears inside. This also lets you turn the axle around and it will still drive forward. Also lets you change the direction of the pumpkin, so it can be passenger side left or right, or driver side left or right. Also you can flip which side the pinon gear is so the axle is a reverse rotater, for rear engine trucks."

4x4,39f1z9,benly1,1 point,Thu Jun 11 19:16:48 2015 UTC,Get a mazzulla kit instead.
4x4,39f1z9,benly1,1 point,Fri Jun 12 05:54:24 2015 UTC,"Looks really good but I can't seem to find the price and it looks expensive. If the kit cost more than 4,000 I wouldn't have enough money for coilovers"
4x4,39f1z9,My_Name_Is_Santa,4,Fri Jun 12 06:15:50 2015 UTC,"To be honest, if you can't afford a quality long travel kit, you are better off with a mid travel one."
4x4,39f1z9,AceFahrenheit,2,Fri Jun 12 15:15:37 2015 UTC,"I can't assure that btf fab,  dixon bros,  jd fab,  Camburg, lsk and any other long travel kit for sale is quality.  The kit you showed me is literally the most expensive bolt on kit for my truck. Including coilovers and double bypass shocks plus a legit engine cage also bump stops that kit would end up close to 10k."
4x4,39f1z9,Boogge,4,Fri Jun 12 16:02:07 2015 UTC,"I don't think you could go wrong with either of the companies listed. They've all got history of building great kits and the steel isn't really going to go wrong, they're all very overbuilt to take all kinds of abuse that they probably wouldn't see on even a race truck. The things you really need to spend money on are the moving components. Uniballs/ball joints, bushings, shocks, springs, etc."
4x4,39f1z9,Boogge,2,Sat Jun 13 02:25:17 2015 UTC,After searching around I'm pretty sure that lsk 4x4 lt kit is the kit for me. They're the only kit that have fabricated spindles that doesn't destroy my budget. I called them up and it should be around 6k with king coilovers which is in my budget.
4x4,39f1z9,Kiriesh,1 point,Sat Jun 13 04:45:07 2015 UTC,This.
4x4,39f1z9,Boogge,1 point,Thu Jun 11 17:08:00 2015 UTC,"Are you looking for a long travel kit? I believe that the 4x4 checked had torsion bars in the front so it might not be worth it to make a long travel without going full custom. Or are you just wanting the ""prerunner"" look with a lift in the front and fiberglass fenders?"
4x4,39f1z9,Boogge,3,Thu Jun 11 17:31:31 2015 UTC,"Also I hope you are adding up the costs here and realizes how much $$. Those kits are over $4000. Then another $2000 for the shocks and bumpstops. And that's just the front Without shipping. Then the rear. Leaf sprung or 3 link? You can easily dump another $4k into the rear and that's just to get it about on par with the front. Then you have to get bigger tires and wheels, that's another $1300 if your lucky. Then fiberglass fenders  ~$1k plus paint to match your truck. So now you have ~$15k into the truck without even having the parts put on. Labor is going to be $$$ if you are not welding and fabricating yourself. Now you can go fast ish. Safety? Roll cage so you don't kills yourself? 4 point seat belts and better suspension seats? Buying the actually truck is the cheapest part. Make sure you get the engine and cab and year you want before putting in the money for all the other stuff. You won't get it back out."
4x4,39f1z9,Boogge,1 point,Thu Jun 11 17:52:33 2015 UTC,Yes I know. I'm willing to spend 7k in the front including fenders of course. I actually have a 2003 ranger edge and I'm selling it for this project. The rear isn't that expensive. I'm not planning to put coil overs on the back. Maybe 2k or 3k for the rear. Also I'm not painting the truck because that would be a waste of money since I get sandblasted at the dunes every once in a while.  You exaggerated the prices by a bit but I do know it's expensive. My brother and I are installing the kit and my brother friends can make me a roll cage.
4x4,39f1z9,Gnatshit,1 point,Thu Jun 11 19:19:43 2015 UTC,why not build up the ranger? A ranger prerunner is pretty popular and will have more equipment to choose from
4x4,39f1z9,9087876,1 point,Thu Jun 11 20:02:02 2015 UTC,No power to spin 33s or 35s. Doesn't matter if your get the 4.0 they just lack power. I know I can switch the gearing to 4.88 but the gas mileage would be absolutely terrible. The space is also very small in those trucks and really not comfortable for when I go to college. I don't want to do an engine swap because that will give problems with the dmv and it's a pain in the ass to find a good 5.0 where I live. The Silverado already has the power to pull 33s and maybe it will push 35s with 4.10s. 4x4 was just an added bonus when I found this truck on Craigslist so I just decided to build a 4x4 prerunner.
4x4,39bhkw,Jimnyzuk,16,Wed Jun 10 17:10:51 2015 UTC,Someone did this with a Tacoma. It looks awesome.
4x4,39bhkw,ABro503,4,Wed Jun 10 17:48:21 2015 UTC,That's what gave me the idea. That Tacoma is awesome.
4x4,39bhkw,Kiriesh,8,Wed Jun 10 18:50:14 2015 UTC,"As neat as that is, if you're doing that much custom work (or spending that much cash in the case of an adventure trailer) why not go with a resq1 style utility bed? You'd be able to customize it more for your needs, have better departure angle, and you get more storage room to boot."
4x4,39bhkw,Kiriesh,1 point,Wed Jun 10 21:18:00 2015 UTC,"A resq1 bed would be awesome.  The chaser trailers are spendy, another option would be a m416 trailer (what the chaser is based on)they are 6' long but I could cut it down to 5' or even 4.5' and still fit a RTT on it. that should give a great departure angle. it might be hard to find a good deal on a M416"
4x4,39bhkw,Kiriesh,1 point,Wed Jun 10 21:49:33 2015 UTC,Most m416 around me will run $700+ for a rusted out piece of crap. If you want to go lightweight Dinoot offers fiberglass tubs for M416. I'm sure they could give you a shortened model.
4x4,39bhkw,PigSlam,1 point,Wed Jun 10 22:27:11 2015 UTC,"Yeah I have seen those. part of me worries that fiberglass wont be that strong, but really it should be just as strong. Plus like you said a lot lighter."
4x4,39bhkw,PigSlam,1 point,Wed Jun 10 22:33:57 2015 UTC,"It all depends on how you reinforce it. If done right the fiberglass panels shouldn't be carrying load. I don't know exact weights for real M416 tubs, but I know even when I tried designing lightweight metal tubs for my 6' offroad trailer they were weighing in 300lbs+. The full 6' fiberglass is a whopping 48lbs."
4x4,39bhkw,pavester,4,Wed Jun 10 22:39:28 2015 UTC,"It took me a few seconds to figure out why you were calling a JK8 a Samurai.  The proportions look great in your photo, but a Samurai is a long way from what you've shown.  It would be quite a feat if you pulled it off.  Good luck."
4x4,39bhkw,dirty_hooker,4,Wed Jun 10 21:55:42 2015 UTC,"This is the samurai that I chopped the trailer onto. https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/01/e9/c4/01e9c42c788690692d5c6fa45e7794ff.jpg Pretty cool on its own. wish I knew more about it.  Stretching the wheel base would not be to hard. could be done with Toyota springs with the off-set pin, plus some fab work for the spring mounts or a simple 3 link."
4x4,39bhkw,facepillownap,6,Wed Jun 10 22:00:49 2015 UTC,"I guess if you can get your hands on that particular Samurai, then it's not much more to stretch the body, but if you're starting with this samurai, you'll have a bit more work on your hands, and suddenly, something like a 1987 Toyota pickup will look a little more reasonable as a starting point.  Like I said, if you're in it for the long haul, then I wish you the best of luck.  Unfortunately, projects like this are probably conceived about 100x as many times as their started, and then probably 1 in 10 of those are ever completed.  So if you're the 1 in 1000, I'm glad we got to talk."
4x4,39bhkw,facepillownap,3,Wed Jun 10 22:03:42 2015 UTC,I agree. I will probably never do this. it would not be worth the work. I would start with a Tacoma. Just thought it was a cool idea.
4x4,39bhkw,mongy,3,Wed Jun 10 22:12:26 2015 UTC,"might as well start with a better vehicle, something like a tacoma/ranger/s10 etc. Not saying the samurai is bad, just seems like alot of work to use the samurai when you can start with a better truck/suv and not have to go and swap out motors/lengthen frames etc."
4x4,39bhkw,mongy,3,Wed Jun 10 21:34:05 2015 UTC,You're right. Even a 2.7 Tacoma is a much better start then this. And would be much less of a head ache. But it would not have the street cred that this would have.  it would be a fun project but in the end I would probably wish I started with a Tacoma. If nothing else just for the AC.
4x4,39bhkw,bragis,4,Wed Jun 10 21:45:08 2015 UTC,"trail cred  Besides, everybody has a Tacoma. Where is the fun in that.  Tin top Sammys and Trackers sometimes had AC."

4x4,39bh44,Kiwibaconator,3,Thu Jun 11 01:13:40 2015 UTC,Mud terrains are not really known for their longevity. They are softer to give you more flex and traction. Get some all terrains if you want something that will last a bit longer. If you are off-roading and spinning tires in the dirt/rocks this is going to happen with any tire.
4x4,39bh44,rucipher,-2,Wed Jun 10 18:58:26 2015 UTC,Thats the thing. I am really intentional about not spinning them.

4x4,39bh44,mparnelly,2,Wed Jun 10 19:25:15 2015 UTC,"Everything I've heard about MTR's says that they are great off road, but leave a lot to be desired on-road unless you have a heavy rig over them (which of course accelerates the wear, but helps with traction).  The compact (Toyota, Nissan, jeep, Suzuki, etc) guys where I live run them, but have traction issues on road when it's wet and slick, but decent wear life. Full sized guys and up have excellent traction but terrible wear life.  I'd only ever run them as an off road tires, and a AT like Geolander AT-S (or your equivalent) for on road."

Really its just easier to buy an old diesel.  I haven't looked through this whole article in awhile, but it has some good tips.  http://www.fourwheeler.com/how-to/129-0706-waterproof-your-4x4-rig/  Edit: I mean that it's a good start for figuring out the issues that might arise.  They ignore the fact that really, every electrical part (lights, electric windows and locks, any stereo equipment, all of your cigarette lighters, electric 4wd -- if you have a switch instead of a stick -- literally every wire, fuse, and relay under the hood and in the car) needs to be waterproofed.

4x4,396gt8,sp4rse,6,Tue Jun 9 18:58:14 2015 UTC,"You are right, they do not have a distributor anymore, they use the engine computer and coil packs as well as I believe a crank position sensor.

I mean, basically any newer vehicle that relies on digital or electric signals will fail in water like that, and I doubt modern American diesels would make it either."

It's unlikely that these sensors are sealed? Waterproof?   They aren't, at least not for submergence like that.  You can try and seal them, but its difficult to seal every connector.   Are snorkels really only for looks?   90% of the snorkels I've seen outside of work (4 wheeling the sahara for soil gas surveys) may not have been installed for show, but its all they're good for (see dust mitigation above as a caveat).   you seem pretty knowledgeable on this stuff, and I'm always curious, thanks!

4x4,396gt8,thepasttenseofdraw,3,Tue Jun 9 19:10:38 2015 UTC,"For water and a gas engine, they really are mall gear.    Not really true.   While diesel engines do better in deep water, all of the newer ones also have lots of fancy electronics on them that will die when under water. Old fully mechanical diesels will work better under water.  Petrol engines will also work in very wet environments for a short time. Think of short river crossings. With the right speed, you create a bow wave in front of your vehicle, and the engine compartment retains a good air pocket. But water does get into the engine bay and splashes around. This water splashing around can be sucked into your air inlet. Enough water (and we are talking about relatively small amounts) entering the engine through the air intake will destroy your engine as it is not compressible.  Also the default air intake location for many vehicles if through the inner guards of the very front of the engine bay, relatively low. Good for the coolest and freshest air, but not good for crossing even relatively shallow water.  So a diesel (old one) is the best for deep water crossings, but a petrol one can also tackle deep water too. In all cases, getting the intake up above the water level is important.  Then there is dust. In Australia we do lots of long distance travel in the outback. Water is generally not the problem, but dust is. Getting the the air intake up high lets the engine breath the coolest and cleanest air."

So a diesel (old one) is the best for deep water crossings, but a petrol one can also tackle deep water too. In all cases, getting the intake up above the water level is important.   Of course. but the issues I'm addressing really apply to deep slow crossings, not those which you can ford with speed (which I will also point out require you to know the actual depth of the water, or else risk the chance of losing your rig).   Then there is dust. In Australia we do lots of long distance travel in the outback. Water is generally not the problem, but dust is. Getting the the air intake up high lets the engine breath the coolest and cleanest air.

None of these are all that hard, but the views are really nice. The only problem is the tour jeeps, which are constantly on the trail and can sometimes act like they own the place, but whatever.   Also in the area, but not in Sedona or Flag is Smiley Rock and Smasher Canyon. Didn't look too closely and what rigs you guys had, but you need pretty well equipped for those.

4x4,395h3f,Undercontrol710,5,Tue Jun 9 16:20:40 2015 UTC,Sounds to me like they don't sell a title with the vehicle and you sign something saying you have no intent on using it for anything other than offroad. So if there is a way around it i don't know.....
4x4,395h3f,ptrain377,2,Tue Jun 9 16:43:41 2015 UTC,"It states no title, only a bill of sell.   I looked it up and it depends on the state you are trying to register it in. Some just have the police check the VIN and an ID to register. Others have alot more."
4x4,395h3f,Oblagon,2,Tue Jun 9 17:01:15 2015 UTC,"Yeah that's a thing with surplus HMMWV's.  Until Gov Planet came along and snatched the contract from Gov Liquidations [who were frankly just lazy and shredding everything], HMMWV releases were pretty rare.  The first major release of surplus HMMWV's was the United Defence auction in the late 1990's, about a 1000 or so got out via a contractor swap with the military. Since the contractor owned the HMMWV's they were legally allowed to sell the trucks to the public, a minor loophole. These trucks were sold with Special Form 97's [SF97] which officially released the vehicle from ownership by the federal government and would allow you to obtain a title.  So if you have a HMMWV with a SF97 it's generally not an issue to title them for tags. HMMWV's in public hands in good shape with SF97 history and plates tend to go for a lot more money.  The gov planet HMMWV's do not ship with a SF97 so that is one reason why they are cheap. Whatever you can title them or not depends on the state.   AM General used to send nastygrams to every state DMV reminding them that HMMWV's do not meet FMVSS regulations and were meant for government use only, but these days AMG doesn't give a shit anymore. Because of that some states have gone on to revoke plates on previously titled HMMWV's.  It's not isolated to HMMWV's some states may decide to remove the ability to tag military vehicles for on road use, but that is an on going issue within the surplus vehicle community. Generally no one cares about a CUCV or an M35 truck, but now with HEMTT's popping up in some negibhourhoods, eyebrows are being raised.  Back to the issue, I have heard a few people had luck registering Gov Planet HMMWVs in Arizona, Alaska and Montana, but do your research and be prepared to treat the rig as a trail only truck as a backup.  The Gov planet trucks are generally great rigs, they have gone through the reconditioning program for a lot of rigs. I've friends that have received ""6.2L diesels"" when in reality they received 6.5 detuned Optimizers with 4L80E's instead, basically getting a 1990's M998A2 chassis with 2006+ running gear.  There's still 4000+ trucks planning to hit gov planet over the next 2 years if they keep up the schedule as is. A lot of runners seem to go for around 10g's [keep in mind there is a 7% tax and 10% buyers fee on the final bid].  If you get something oddball like a slant back, those sponsons and turret roof tend to go for 8-12k by itself, so a good complete truck like that could sell for 20-30k without a SF97.  But back to the point, SF97 paperwork with the HMMWV with no restrictions? No real problems to get a plate. If you get an already plated truck that has had a SF97 at some point in the past you are good to go. Bill of sale only?   It depends. Good luck!"

4x4,3983g6,Doctor_M_Toboggan,3,Tue Jun 9 22:56:19 2015 UTC,"Short answer, yes and no!  Longer answer, you'll probably be fine depending of how hard you push it, however anything even pavement driving can take your alignment out. I have an old Ford TTB front axle, it's spend more of its life out of alignment than straight I'd reckon. If I so much as look at a puddle the wrong way I can feel it go out.  Solid axles primarily kingpin go out less than ball joint solid axles, followed by a IFS front end, then a TTB IFS.  Take it careful and be safe and you should be fine, but if something feels off when you get off the trail get it looked at.  Try hitting up Groupon, where I live shops put alignments on there all the time for dirt cheap, (so they can sell you on other work), but it helps the wallet, especially since you are stock. If I didn't have a awful setup that required extra love I'd do it myself."

4x4,395oh8,dirty_hooker,2,Thu Jun 11 07:23:01 2015 UTC,"Almost never. The p38s had huge issues with the air suspension that were common, and costly to repair. The DII is on coils, and as such has none of these problems. The main pitfall of the DII is ABS faults, but you can still drive it without ABS. If your suspension compressor goes on a p38, you are driving home on the bump stops. The 4.6L v8 in the p38s and the '03 and '04 DIIs, frankly, is a terrible motor. At that point, Land Rover was running out of money, and their quality control went downhill. However, as the vehicles get older, the ""bad seeds"" of the bunch are being weeded out, and if you are very careful not to overheat it, they can last a long time. The temp gauge on the dash is way too insensitive. Most people with these engines buy a Scangauge, and a lower temperature thermostat off of a TD5 motor. A diesel Discovery is fairly bombproof, other than the easily fixed issue with the front propshaft, and the ABS issues. Of course they decided not to sell those in America, so the Land Rover name has been sullied."

I was looking at a 2003 d2 with less miles (97k or something) and we were working on getting the out the price down to less than 6k (keep in mind this thing was pristine, swapped 4.6 when the first oil pump grenaded, full service records from a LR dealership from the single previous owner, and over 14k put in service and maintenance, over its life, as well as many features and stuff from the factory, i.e. bull bar, etc). Probably would have even bought it, drove it and everything and had a deal (or so I thought) with the dealership, but they sold it to someone else who was willing to go to 6400.  Still kinda wish I had that truck, but considering I have no garage, and limited tools with me at my apartment in Chicago (lucky enough to even have a designated parking spot) it would be pretty tough to do any maintenance on my own if I were to get into a bind due to something failing, so I went with the ole reliable trusty 3.4l v6 4runner.   This way I can drive it as I please in the city and when I need to do something serious I just drive home to Kansas where my dad has a garage that is meant for working on cars, because besides preventive maintenance and regular service, this 4runner truck runs perfectly. If it werent for those things though, you bet your ass I would have pulled the trigger and grabbed an LR.   /end rant, if you cant tell it was a process and I still think about it haha."

Picked it up on a trailer, had it running that night, spent an unnecessary amount of money on so-called specialists to get the LPG system running right (which is why it didn't run), they didn't manage, I found the problem by accident (crossed wiring to the LPG injectors).  A year or so later I had to replace the ABS modulator, not sure why as this is pretty much the only later-style modulator I've known to fail, but I bought a second-hand one off a friend for €500 or so, and swapped it in in an evening.  Apart from that, I've had 2.5 years of fairly trouble free motoring, everything that needed fixing was due to accidents or off-roading. I bought it at 245k km, it has 326k km now. Changed the oil every 5k km, filter every 10k km. Only retired it from daily duties a few weeks ago.   I think, even adding in maintenance, I didn't spend more than €5k on it since I bought it.

4x4,392jg1,BlokeInTheMountains,4,Tue Jun 9 13:34:21 2015 UTC,This is a good plan but is more complicated than this.  Just remember that trails are dynamic movement and not static. You may be at an angle that was safe with the forklift but a small bounce tips you over because you don't have enough compensation to stop the momentum.  1) Have the tires at the pressure you will be wheeling at.  2) subtract at least 10 degrees due to the difference from static and dynamic stability.  3) the closer you are to the angle the slower you need to be moving.  4) If you start to roll turn downhill and give it power! But only briefly and try to stop against something. Better to dent your truck than roll it. Any braking should be very gentle until you are out of danger.
4x4,392jg1,BlokeInTheMountains,1 point,Tue Jun 9 16:46:47 2015 UTC,Points well made.
4x4,392jg1,fastdbs,5,Tue Jun 9 20:13:21 2015 UTC,"Yeah there is no quick answer, it will just have to come with experience.  Also you've discovered the reason you should nearly always build your rig only just high enough to clear the tires you want to run. Any extra lift just makes you more tippy.  Hence why the supper high mall crawlers are pretty useless.  The only real antidote is widening your track width. The cheapest way being wheel spacers. But they cause their own issues.  The other option is wider axles. Which is why the ultimate is a narrow truck (Zuk, Toyota, Jeep) on full width 1-ton axles. Check this out https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoK883JgKE0  As far as clearance goes, it's better to scrape your belly or high center than flop.  If you get into a situation when you feel tippy, have the missus get out and stand on the slider on the high side. That extra weight out there can make all the difference and if you do go over she will feel it and can just step off. Just remember to go super slow.   Even better, tie your recovery strap around your b-pillar and have some people pulling on it.  Also be well versed in what to do if you start to go over. i.e. steering the direction you are tipping if you can, and accelerate into it. Stepping on the brakes can cause a weight transfer that makes things worse.  Some of the scariest situations I have been in have been on high rocky mountain shelf roads. No room to steer or correct if she starts to go over, and usually a very large drop."
4x4,392jg1,RichardLillard1,4,Mon Jun 8 21:48:18 2015 UTC,"so a 3"" lift with the stock size in tire (with wrangler tires) is not as good if i had made my wheels and tires bigger?"
4x4,392jg1,fastdbs,4,Mon Jun 8 21:56:58 2015 UTC,Bingo.  Usually if you go up from stock size you'll also be getting a wider tire (e.g. 33x12.50r15). The extra width counters the lift needed.
4x4,392jg1,RichardLillard1,2,Mon Jun 8 22:00:44 2015 UTC,"would you go as far to say its not safe as is and going on a off camber hill? or would i just be better off with different wheels and tires?

4x4,392jg1,Kiwibaconator,3,Mon Jun 8 22:18:42 2015 UTC,Don't worry about it too much. I doubt you are wheeling trails that will roll you over.  Just be aware and go slow and steady.

The cans you can buy online are not what we use in the military in the U.S, a NATO country. The cans we use are not camlock or metal. They are plastic and have a screw on cap with a rubber seal. They do in fact leak (Personal Exp) because our equipment is built by the lowest bidder. If OP found cans that do not leak at all than good on him, but they are not anything used in the military that I have seen, and they may also be magical... cheers to building stuff because you want to, regardless of how dangerous."
4x4,38yxm3,CoGa,1 point,Tue Jun 9 06:16:01 2015 UTC,"""NATO-style"" is universally used to describe any can that is the same as the original Wehrmacht design, presumably because no-one can spell the latter. This means: 1 fully welded seam - no flat bottom like Blitz cans. 1 cam-locking spout, with rubber gasket.  These two design features makes it leak-proof provided the gasket is kept in good condition and the can is not split."
4x4,38yxm3,06Wrangler,8,Tue Jun 9 09:00:03 2015 UTC,You may say they never leak but never light a lighter in your car. When I was a fire investigator we had a guy with jerry cans go up in flames lighting a cig. Past tense for a reason. He was super dead.

4x4,38z4ei,PesareSabz,1 point,Mon Jun 8 09:58:32 2015 UTC,"Yep, factory lift to smooth the ride out. It's just the way the Dutch army wanted it to perform. I was considering getting a ex-mil G-Wagon because it's a relatively cheap and awesome off road rig that's ready to go. Personally I would rather spend the extra 3-4k for the Bundeswehr for the 5 cyl engine because I love how German diesel 5 cyl sound. I also wouldn't mind having a 5th gear, a low speed and reserve tank, even if the ride is a little rougher. The Dutch has one less gear, one less cyl, and no low speed, but the taller suspension gives it a smoother ride. There is no noticeable difference in performance  from what I hear.   I've been wanting an off roading rig (I'm still a poor student) and an ex-mil G-wagon is the top of the list. I just need to find 10k or more for a Bundeswehr. I'd love to see more pics of the G-wagon once your buddy takes it out and gets it dirty."

In the end I reasoned that the SAS was going to cost about the same as a tow out of some of the places I was breaking.  Budget on the SAS first. It will solve a bunch of problems. This will lift the front end enough for 35s easily. Your front locker options will be better and you won't have to worry about breaking steering components or control arms or ball joints or CVs.

I think looking into this would be your better option rather than emptying your wallet with parts and taking up all your time installing and fixing. A manual tranny swap into an automatic would be very stressful and costly and would require experience. Your best bet would be to buy a new vehicle that was built around the kind of driving you want to do instead of trying to wrench something out of a vehicle that wasn't.

You can expand carrying capacity by pulling an off-road capable trailer.  Bigger, heavier trucks can be great for overlanding.  What are your goals? What's the most difficult terrain you plan to traverse?"
4x4,38xv2i,M3moogle,1 point,Sun Jun 7 21:13:55 2015 UTC,"I'm going for something that can do as much as possible.   A vehicle I can sleep/overland in, something I can use day to day (road legal, can still handle highway driving), but also handle more than just dirt roads. Where I am now gets very muddy in the summer and tons of snow in the winter, so I'd want something that can handle a lot.   I was thinking a half ton truck would be ideal, or are they too big?"
4x4,38xv2i,Kiriesh,2,Sun Jun 7 22:04:51 2015 UTC,1/2 tons aren't really preffered for off road because of their size.
4x4,38xv2i,BamboozlingBooty,1 point,Sun Jun 7 23:55:48 2015 UTC,"It depends on what you're wanting and your budget. Half tons are great but are definitely big so you risk more body damage on tight trails. In addition while they're great for moderate towing and hauling moderate loads, their fuel economy will suffer. Seeing as how you're in an SUV currently, Id say don't rule one out. They can be set up fairly cheap, and offer a large enclosed space without modifications if you get a 4 door model. A 4.0L Cherokee (XJ) is cheap with large aftermarket support and can usually get high teens fuel economy even modified. Similarly an older 4Runner with the 22re/5spd combo while a bit pricier will be great on gas and has a large community support. Both will perform well onroad and offroad while giving better fuel economy than most 1/2 tons and fitting better on trails. Don't rule out 1/4 tons too, Tacomas, Rangers, frontiers, etc are all very good trucks too that will be much easier to drive than a larger full size. This is all coming from a guy who wheels a wrangler, used to DD a ram 1500, and just got a tacoma to take over the DD/overlanding duty."
4x4,38xv2i,PraisinDaSun,1 point,Sun Jun 7 22:43:44 2015 UTC,"I'm not personally familiar with the quarter vs. half vs. heavy duty question. But as far as a hardcore offroader goes, to access as many trails as you possibly can you want your rig to be smaller so, you would want to either get a light truck or, if that isn't what you're interested in, get a full sized single or extended cab truck."

They do way better offroad except for rocks, where they suck. The rear can have more weight on it and not sink in, and pull the front out if that gets stuck. Also they stay more stable, and the tires wont dive into a hole as easy.

4x4,38rtxr,trainergames,2,Sat Jun 6 07:06:36 2015 UTC,"Looks like you're into Ford Rangers. Anything pre 1996 (don't count me on that number) will have fords awesome TTB front suspension. Really tough, drives kinda like IFS, but has the clearence similar to a SFA. Easily upgradeable, and shouldn't break the bank too much.   You can find 2wd and 4wd versions with TTB but I think the 4wd ones only came with the V6 at the time, the little 4cyl engines will run forever though.   If you want to get into off-roading, you're going to need at least 4x4 w/o lockers. 2wd off-roading is just asking for trouble"

Here is an example of a different brand of truck,but that gives idea of how i would like the truck to look after i am done.  http://www.yotatech.com/attachments/f199/88946d1347520123-1986-toyota-4x4-sr5-xtra-cab-back-future-replica-truck-alpine-2.jpg  I all i really care about is,i would perfer a 4cyl engine,because of gas mileage a 6cyl would be fine as long as it gets really good gas mileage. Other than that i want to haul stuff in the bed and tow,like i said before lol,and the lite offroading,i can pm a google maps link to the trails i want to try,and i at least once a week i see people entering or leaving it.  Also my plan for the budget to get the truck,i will save up up once i get to $600 then start looking for a truck that needs some work that i can fix,if i am unable to find one in that budget in 2 weeks,i will then add a little more to my budget from my paycheck and keep looking. I want to do that until i can find something.  Now i just need to find out what kinda of trucks to look for. That is why i am asking you guys.  So what trucks would be what i want in a truck,and be fixable for a beginner? What engines should i look for? Which should i avoid? I am wanting to know so i can be ready when it is time,i have already done the research for what i pick as my daily driver car."
4x4,38rtxr,dmartin16,1 point,Sat Jun 6 19:17:34 2015 UTC,"The rangers are going to be the most affordable small size pickup trucks. You can also look into the Mazda b series, they're just a rebadged ranger. Stay away from the 3.0 V6, as I've heard nothing but terror stories about them. I had a 92 with a 2.2 4 banger that would only hit 75mph going down hill, so if you're going to tow more than 5-600 pounds, get the V6. The 4.0 is a damn solid motor and is very very hard to kill.  I also had an 03 Nissan Frontier, and of all ~20ish vehicles I've had, it's the one I miss the most (that and a 99 acura integra). The king cabs (extended cab) are roomy enough for a kid, but laughable if you think you'll ever fit an adult back there. The single cabs usually come in a bench seat config, and can fit 3 average size adults without much of a problem.  2wd is ok to start with if you're going on dirt roads, but anything beyond a regular dirt road you'll have trouble with (you can overcome most stuff that 4x4 would get you out of, IF you use speed, which will likely cause you to damage stuff.)  I'd say aim for a mid 90's 4x4 ext cab 4.0 ranger or b series, but don't hesitate if you see one of the nissan hardbody's, or toyota pickups jump up. Even the chevy S10/GMC s15's are good (the 4.3L is a chevy 350 missing 2 cylinders and is very very reliable.)"

4x4,38qhvc,sirtjapkes,2,Sat Jun 6 03:18:33 2015 UTC,"Look into the Hobart handler 190. It's a good entry level 220v mig, as long as you have 220v available id recommend it. If you only want to do body work, get something smaller. But If you want to weld random jeep parts, get this one. Want to turn a nut into a weld nut? Weld it. Exhaust hanger broke? Weld it back together. Buy a bumper kit you weld yourself? Get this one."
4x4,38qhvc,Gvfytghjjjjhhh,5,Sat Jun 6 03:45:16 2015 UTC,"Don't bother if you don't have 220V in your shop. Seriously. 110v is barely enough to weld 1/8"" steel.  But from there take a look at the Hobart 210 MVP and Lincoln 210 MP.  The Hobart is a bit cheaper and will last forever (transformer based, little electronics, simple, robust, nice soft arc, I have one it's great).   The Lincoln is newer, inverter based, and has an optional (overpriced) TIG package available. The user interface is pretty nice on it."
4x4,38qhvc,BlokeInTheMountains,2,Sat Jun 6 00:05:07 2015 UTC,I completely agree. I have a 220 Lincoln buzz box that resides at my buddies shop because I'm still working on getting 220v at my place.   I bought a Hobart 125 mig to do little stuff and hold me over but I'm seriously regretting it. It has a hard time welding exhaust. Very big buyers remorse with that one.   But my buzzbox kicks ass. Bonus it's from the 60s. I'd be willing to bet the damn thing will outlive me. Still welds great after all these years.   But I really want a 220v mig too. 110 welding is a waste.

4x4,38qhvc,asadog,1 point,Sat Jun 6 17:00:03 2015 UTC,I have a 110 mig wire. I used it to build a crossover pipe for 5vz swap and to put body patch panel on. I welded up a crack on a law mower deck. That's the max of what it can do. A little 220 Hobart would be ideal.

Dirt cheap  (mine was 75 on cl), they work in practically any condition, and you don't have to worry about gas. Grab some 6011 and some scrap steel and you will get it down in a few practice sessions."

Find some beefier springs(if you're going to be using the truck to haul anything, especially a plow). Figure out if you need a new tail housing for the trans, if so, get one. Find a way to mount the transfer case. Put your springs on the axle, put tires and wheels on the axle and decide where you want it to sit. Once you've done that, build mounts for the leaf springs. If you're building this thing into an off road rig, now's the time to build a link-type suspension."

I'll look at the leaks and all, didn't ask what or where yet, was just texting (we were both at work lol), so I'll get the info when I look at the truck. Thanks for the good news of it looking to be strong! I'll check out the weld points and all that, I'm sure he's good for it though. THanks!"
4x4,38lzft,God_HatesFigs,3,Fri Jun 5 02:50:11 2015 UTC,"For a Ford Ranger, yeah shackle lift is probably just fine. Heavier trucks or ones that are always hauling means that you have to worry about the leafs flattening over time."
4x4,38lzft,God_HatesFigs,1 point,Fri Jun 5 04:06:32 2015 UTC,"interesting, so for a heavier trucks does putting in coils/shocks prevent the flattening?"
4x4,38lzft,Boogge,2,Fri Jun 5 04:07:28 2015 UTC,"I hear different things on how people believe shocks effect your leafs. Some think that longer shocks help the lift, but some people think that adding them actually flattens your leafs down faster.   I did a lot of research when I was looking for lifts for my truck. And a lot of forums push towards AAL kits (Add A Leaf) because they can add some flex and increase carrying load. I have a Frontier but this is a good rundown on what kits do and each of their pros and cons"

4x4,38epb0,Tim_Teboner,0,Thu Jun 4 03:09:25 2015 UTC,"Jeep Grand Cherokee (ZJ):       This is the first generation. For overview of all models, see Jeep Grand Cherokee  The ""ZJ"" models, manufactured from 1992 to 1998, originally came in three trim levels: base, Laredo, and Limited. The base model included features such as full instrumentation, cloth interior, a standard five-speed manual transmission, and was given the ""SE"" name for the 1994 model year. Power windows and locks were not standard equipment on the base and SE, although they were finally included in 1995. The minimal difference in price resulted in low consumer demand, so the low-line model was eventually discontinued. Additional standard features included a driver-side air bag and four-wheel anti-lock braking system (ABS). The Laredo was the mid-scale model with standard features that included power windows, power door locks, and cruise control. Exterior features included medium-grey plastic paneling on the lower body and five-spoke aluminum wheels. The Limited was the premium model, featuring lower body paneling that was the same color as the rest of the vehicle. The Limited also had standard features such as leather seating, power sunroof, heated mirrors, heated power seats, and a keyless entry system. The ""Up-Country"" version was also offered between 1993 and 1997, often painted ""Champagne Pearl"" or black. It came with 4WD and a 4.0 straight-6. Package groups with the various trim levels included: Convenience, Fog Lamp / Skid Plate, Lighting, Luxury, Power, Security, Trailer/Towing.  When it was first introduced in April 1992 as an early 1993 model year vehicle, the Grand Cherokee only had one powertrain choice: the 4.0L AMC-derived 4.0L Power Tech I6 engine that produced 190 horsepower. This became the ""volume"" engine for the Grand Cherokee. Transmission choices included a four-speed automatic transmission (early production ZJs used the AW4 - the A500SE (later 42RE) replaced the AW4 during the latter half of the 1993 model year) or an Aisin AX15 manual transmission. Low demand for the manual transmission resulted in its discontinuation after the 1993 model year for North America but it remained on the option list for European ZJs (ZGs sold in Europe with the diesel powertrain retained the AX15). The drive train choices included rear-wheel drive or four-wheel-drive. In 1995, the engine lost 5 horsepower to 185 due to new EPA regulations imposed on the 1996 model year.

4x4,38epb0,DennyCH,5,Thu Jun 4 15:37:44 2015 UTC,Why would you leave the sway bar attached?
4x4,38epb0,snoopycrafter,6,Wed Jun 3 21:19:53 2015 UTC,It doesnt appear to have disconnects so it might be something like an anti-rock off road sway bar.   It also wasn't that difficult of a trail at all. He coulda done it in 2wd if he wanted.
4x4,38epb0,DennyCH,3,Wed Jun 3 21:50:41 2015 UTC,"That's definitely an ""anti-rock"" sway bar"
4x4,38epb0,jshea,2,Wed Jun 3 21:53:43 2015 UTC,Whats that?
4x4,38epb0,Tim_Teboner,3,Thu Jun 4 01:25:07 2015 UTC,I'm not right sure but it sounds like it keeps the body roll down while still allowing articulation. Not really sure though

4x4,38epb0,MattyB4x4,2,Thu Jun 4 02:17:39 2015 UTC,"I wasn't questioning its capability, it's just strange to see a ""built"" offroad vehicle that still has a sway bar, or no quick disconnects at least"
4x4,38epb0,dirty_hooker,1 point,Wed Jun 3 21:51:51 2015 UTC,Yeah once you drew my attention to it I noticed how strange that is. I think its gotta be an antirock or something
4x4,38epb0,LanceGoodthrust,2,Wed Jun 3 21:55:36 2015 UTC,"This isn't the type of swaybar that you're used to.  Allows articulation, yet limits body roll.  Adjustable with a different bar.  Allows for greater overall driveability."
4x4,38dh9h,TK44,8,Wed Jun 3 14:36:49 2015 UTC,"This is a 1974, purchased a few years ago for about 15K.   The guy that owns it was nice enough to explain to me how pretty much everything works on it, though I did not want to be weird and take pictures of everything.   It's all pretty neat: Seats 10 in back, back seats can be removed by removing a total of 6 bolts. All components are modular- so if you break an axel- you can easily just strip the different layers of axel down to the part you broke and swap in a new one in about an hour- front can be used in back also. The entire body is held on by 6-8 bolts. There is a center 'frame' section that goes from the winch mount to the tow receiver and all of the drivetrain and body is mounted directly to/ inside of this.   This is the same model as everyones favorite gif of one of these climbing that vertical wall.   For anyone that has an extra $15K or more lying around I can give you the number of the guy who imports these and Unimog 404s locally. Apparently you can take them in rough shape, or pay to have them completely stripped and refurbished."

4x4,38dh9h,stu8319,3,Wed Jun 3 18:24:00 2015 UTC,The best part about it IMO is that this guy actually uses it on the trails here in Colorado. He has a cabin in the mountains that he claims to access requires him to cross multiple 3' water crossings. He even took all the back stuff off one time and hauled a side-by-side ATV and claims that it was incredibly stable and somehow gave him the best mileage he has ever gotten before: 14mpg!

4x4,38dh9h,bricksinthewall,4,Wed Jun 3 18:47:08 2015 UTC,"Basically, much of the vehicle is symmetrical. That being such, you can just take say part of the front axle assembly (which is built in these bolt on sections) and move it to the rear. The driveshafts for instance are both the same front and rear. The entire idea behind the vehicle was to build something that could not be stopped in the battlefield, and is incredibly easy to repair. In a nut shell, anyway."

I'm about to move to MA (Boston, specifically) and I was reading up on the vehicle modification rules, and I notice that you follow, well, none of them.   I think that the calculated maximum suspension lift for an XJ came out to be around 2.5"". I have a 4"" lift. Although that's really the least of my worries since who's going to check that? Fender flares covering the tires. I have the stock ones, which don't extend out far enough. You don't have any (I know that the reading of this one could make it not apply to 4WD vehicles). Mud flaps. Which you also don't have.   I know that you're in Western MA and inspections are probably more strict in Boston, but have you ever had any trouble passing inspection?"

4x4,38gc4i,Gnatshit,3,Thu Jun 4 20:18:44 2015 UTC,"Limb risers aren't road legal in many places due to the pedestrian safety issues.  Just imagine someone flying through the air, and suddenly all that force (perhaps two or more times their body weight) is suddenly concentrated in a 1/8""-thick metal cable. If it somehow didn't break the skin, it sure as hell would hurt.  Of course, if you got hit by a lifted vehicle (especially one as boxy as a Jeep), chances are that you would end up under the tires rather than on the hood."
4x4,38gc4i,01hair,-1,Thu Jun 4 20:40:07 2015 UTC,I understand the mechanism of injury. Simple advice such as making them quick disconnect would be more productive.  Blunt force trauma is more likely to kill you over anything in  a MVA.
4x4,38gc4i,Gnatshit,1 point,Thu Jun 4 20:45:34 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah, the ""slicing pedestrians in half"" is terribly dramatic. I wasn't the one who said it. I'm curious how fast you'd have to be going for that to actually slice you in half...  Adding tensioners would also be a good idea..."
4x4,38gc4i,01hair,1 point,Thu Jun 4 20:50:57 2015 UTC,"True, fair enough."
4x4,38gc4i,Gnatshit,1 point,Thu Jun 4 20:52:39 2015 UTC,There is no need for a disconnect as this rig has never needed brush wires and never would never need them.  The windscreen slope is sufficient to do the job without wires.  They are there for looks alone.

4x4,38gc4i,Gnatshit,1 point,Fri Jun 5 01:24:32 2015 UTC,"I really don't understand this mind-set.  You want to see an example of someone dying with that exact dangerous modification before you can see it is dangerous?  Are you volunteering?  Are the cases of motorcyclists being literally cut in half by wire rope barriers not enough for you to see the danger in exposed wires on a vehicle used on public roads?  If this guy did actually have a vehicle which needed brush wires (he dosen't, the windscreen slope is plenty) and used the vehicle to push through low branches (he dosen't, the snorkle and rack show that clearly) then there might be some reason to have them.  But instead these are poser modifications which serve no purpose other than endangering the public."

4x4,38h6gx,DoctrVendetta,5,Thu Jun 4 04:33:54 2015 UTC,You're way in over your head. If you want to make a long travel move fast desert truck it needs to be light. A 12v is not light at all and is certainly not ideal for a desert truck.   Your suspension will limit you. Not your motor. Focus on deciding what you want.

4x4,38eand,_dtch,2,Wed Jun 3 17:25:56 2015 UTC,"That cage in top is called a safari rack, it does increase body roll a bit but not as much as you'd think. Removing the tire is a bit of a nuisance. I have one and im quite happy with it."
4x4,38eand,Highfrutosepornsyrup,1 point,Fri Jun 5 22:22:26 2015 UTC,"Having a spare on top increases body roll around corners, and makes it more difficult to remove in the event that you need it."
4x4,38eand,Tim_Teboner,1 point,Wed Jun 3 23:28:30 2015 UTC,Never thought of that. Maybe a rear spare? I've seen rear mods for XJs where the spare folds down to open the hatch. Maybe there's a similar mod for the Path.
4x4,38ejfv,yoda7326,5,Wed Jun 3 18:14:19 2015 UTC,"I have a dual t-case setup and usually run open diffs.  The t-case gives the ability to ooze slow and control front, rear or both.  Gives great control but if your spinning, a tap on the front or rear locker will usually get you going again.  I always use my gears but I seldom use my lockers.  Of course it depends on what type of wheeling you do, where your do it (middle of nowhere by yourself with others) and if your okay stacking rocks or pulling a winch line."
4x4,38ejfv,lgrt,1 point,Thu Jun 4 04:05:31 2015 UTC,"That makes a lot of sense, this is exactly the type of response I was hoping for.  I appreciate your input.  I don't have a winch, so as a rule, I generally never go wheelin unless I'm with at least one other truck.  I prefer rock crawling, although there isn't a lot of it in my area, so its mostly a mix of forest/river beds n such."
4x4,38ejfv,Muffgoodman,3,Thu Jun 4 04:37:56 2015 UTC,"There's s bigger question that needs to be answered first. Why do you have free parts laying around that you could put on to your truck? Just do it. The opposite is true if you had a set of arb lockers laying around and you thought to yourself ""I should have dual tcase first"". Your crazy not to do it. Even if it applies too much power to the wheels it's one more thing you can check off the list of badass 4x4 parts needed on your truck."
4x4,38ejfv,Muffgoodman,2,Wed Jun 3 19:43:55 2015 UTC,"I totally agree with you, but it won't be completely free.  I will still need to buy the adapter which is like $500, plus having the shafts modified, so I'm not sure if that money would be better spent on a locker, seeing as the t-cases aren't going anywhere.  But you do raise a very good point."
4x4,38ejfv,Muffgoodman,2,Wed Jun 3 21:29:09 2015 UTC,What lockers would you buy? Front and rear?
4x4,38ejfv,Muffgoodman,1 point,Wed Jun 3 23:33:24 2015 UTC,"Ideally I'd like to go for something selectable, either cable operated or e locker, but my brother has a diff with a luchbox locker that he would likely sell me for cheap, so that may also be a viable option.  I'm currently in the middle of a frame swap, so I figured if I'm doing my tranny cross member anyways, I might as well upgrade some other shit while I'm at it, but funds are limited, as I'm sure you can understand, so I have to be very selective about which way I go with it.  If it proves to be too expensive, I might just stick with my current setup, although I've been dreaming of dual cases for a long time, and I don't plan on tearing it apart again anytime soon, so now would be the best time to undertake a task such as that.  Sorry, I kind of went on a tangent, I hope that answers your question haha."
4x4,38ejfv,BlokeInTheMountains,1 point,Thu Jun 4 00:22:27 2015 UTC,If your doing frame swap definitely do the tcase mod now! Later on it will be a pain the ass and you will put it off till tomorrow then tomorrow turns into 5 years. However lockers is something you will definitely want and that's something you won't put off like you would the tcase mod. In the mean time buy your bros lunchbox diff and fun with that till funds are back. Just be careful not to over load the lunchbox diff. If it blows it will cost more for repairs than just buying a selectable locker right away.
4x4,38ejfv,BlokeInTheMountains,2,Thu Jun 4 00:47:36 2015 UTC,"Solid advice.  Thank you for reaffirming my plans for duals.  I will take your advice and order myself an adapter plate :)  I can throw lockers in at any time, but I'll only be doing a frame swap once.....hopefully.  I'll be sure to post some pics of the whole procedure!"

4x4,3897pi,Kiriesh,5,Tue Jun 2 19:35:52 2015 UTC,Save the airing up and down for when you get to the spot. Driving that low on most tires at speed isn't particularly good for your sidewalls.

4x4,388csf,M3moogle,6,Tue Jun 2 15:59:26 2015 UTC,Between those 2 the big difference would be space/size. That 4Runner is going to be way more comfortable as a daily driver. The Jeep will be cheaper to build up (assuming you stay with leaf springs). The length of the 4Runner will help on climbs but the YJ will be more nimble. Depending on what type of wheeling you are looking to get into I'd think 4Runner will be more like to get body damage. Although a lot of that comes down to good spotting and being careful.
4x4,388csf,jc80,0,Tue Jun 2 17:08:48 2015 UTC,"This.  We all have to get to and from the trails.  One thing I'd add though is that the auto can be easier for noobs on the trails. With an extra reduction box (atlas or doubler) manual is king, but in stock trim auto can make a big difference."
4x4,388csf,BlokeInTheMountains,1 point,Tue Jun 2 18:23:46 2015 UTC,Im going to end up skipping this 4runner at this time.

I still want to test drive a 4runner and two more just popped up online that I'll go check out. I'd Love a manual but they're rare
4x4,388csf,you_know_how_I_know,2,Tue Jun 2 20:14:23 2015 UTC,The best piece of advice I can give you is to take your time and don't pull the trigger until you know it's the right one.

4x4,38321s,GreenTJ,4,Mon Jun 1 15:57:36 2015 UTC,Tops are removable from factory
4x4,38321s,trchili,3,Mon Jun 1 17:09:52 2015 UTC,"Some minor modifications are needed however. You must cut the weatherstripping that seals the driver and passenger doors, plus the tailgate/liftgate weatherstripping as well. The wiring for the dome light must also be cut. Also you're gonna need two strong people or a lifting mechanism. The tops (like everything else IHC) are really fucking heavy."
4x4,38321s,IvanLyon,3,Mon Jun 1 19:37:22 2015 UTC,Sweet. This is an old favourite of mine in Iceland.
4x4,38321s,xCAPTAINxTEXASx,1 point,Mon Jun 1 17:42:30 2015 UTC,There's one that's rusting and wasting away in a yard here.  Missing doors and hatch.  Anybody have a reasonable idea of what I should pay for it?  Assuming the frame isn't rusted out and the motor is still in it.  I'd hate to see it waste away.
4x4,38321s,trchili,2,Mon Jun 1 18:03:21 2015 UTC,"The motor surprisingly ain't worth shit. You can find them all over the place because they're very stout and the vehicles they were put in were used up and thrown away. If the frame is good and not cracked (check around the body and spring mounts!), and it's got a good running motor with a heap of a body, I'd say $250-300. If the motor is shot it's just scrap. Probably worth about the same honestly..."
4x4,38321s,xCAPTAINxTEXASx,2,Mon Jun 1 19:50:09 2015 UTC,"Gotcha.  I've been watching it for a while, but I'm nearing the end of my Ramcharger project so I wouldn't mind taking it on if it isn't too far gone."
4x4,38321s,trchili,2,Mon Jun 1 20:02:29 2015 UTC,"You can buy just about everything to build a Scout from the ground up these days. It's really quite surprising. Even fiberglass tubs (bodies) are available from Super Scout Specialists. The only problem with that route is that most everything you can buy inexpensively isn't factory correct. There is little OE repro parts available, so if you want to do a factory-correct build, then things will get very expensive and it will take a very long time to find all the NOS parts you'll need. It's easier and cheaper to just buy a good survivor in that case.   If you just want a fun truck to drive, then going to after-market is what you'll want to do and building a ""street-modified"" class truck is easier and cheaper (and better, because a lot of the factory parts you'll need are shitty and prone to failure). Thankfully these are mostly all shitty little things that don't really affect the actual operation of the truck. Exceptions being the TC-134 single-speed transfer case (you don't want this thing anyway), and the lock-o-matic hubs (these aren't quite as terrible, but they're close and they will eventually bite you in the ass without plenty of good maintenance, if you actually off-road you'll want to dump them quick)."
4x4,38321s,xCAPTAINxTEXASx,2,Mon Jun 1 20:32:49 2015 UTC,"Interesting.  I had plans to just get things working, swap in a reliable V6 and just clean it up a bit.  My mother has told me stories of her father taking the family to the beach in one of these so I was just going to get it running and give it to her."
4x4,38321s,trchili,1 point,Mon Jun 1 21:11:52 2015 UTC,"Interesting thought. I've not seen any v6 swaps. The 304 and 345 are pretty darn reliable, just thirsty. Best reliability mods you can make on them is an HEI distributor and Holly 2300 list 7448 carburettor.   There were also two four-cylinders engines available that were just half of an IH SV 304ci or 392ci v8, they're reliable as well but not very refined and fairly well unloved.  Stock six cylinders were the AMC/Jeep inline 232ci and 258ci engines. Those are the same engine family as the well-loved AMC/Jeep 4.0 and I've long suspected it would be a pretty easy swap to a Jeep 4.0 HO fuel injected motor.  Finally there was a diesel option. IHC sourced their small diesel from Nissan. Both the SD33 and SD33T are found in Scouts. Insofar as diesels go, they're not all that great. Parts are hard to find, they're not super reliable, or stout, nor do they produce much horsepower or torque. There are plenty of guys that love them and I wouldn't hesitate to own one, but I'm also perhaps a bit touched in the head when it comes to obscure vehicles."
4x4,38321s,xCAPTAINxTEXASx,1 point,Mon Jun 1 21:44:18 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I imagined the parts for their stock engines would've been hard to find.  That's why I had planned on swapping in the 6 cylinder.  That and the gas mileage vs a V8.  Just turn it into a fun, plucky little beach goer."
4x4,38321s,trchili,1 point,Mon Jun 1 22:32:48 2015 UTC,"The IH SV-series of v8 engines are actually pretty easy to find parts for. You can still go to a Navistar International dealer and buy straight from the parts counter. Those engines were used in all sorts of industrial applications, and for a long time after the Scout was discontinued."
4x4,38321s,xCAPTAINxTEXASx,1 point,Mon Jun 1 23:53:30 2015 UTC,Really?  That's interesting.  I'm gonna have to look into that if I can get the truck
4x4,38321s,mcthreadski,1 point,Tue Jun 2 03:04:50 2015 UTC,I had one that was in rough shape that I paid $300 for. I sold a year or so later for $300. It was just too far gone to waste time and effort trying to fix up. It did run though.
4x4,38321s,trchili,2,Mon Jun 1 19:08:05 2015 UTC,"They always run. The real unicorn Scout is the one with a good body and bad motor. I know guys that have traded hundreds of Scouts and have seen one, maybe two with good bodies and bad motors. The IHC ""SV"" series of motors are just stupidly stout for duty in a ""lightweight"" 4x4.   The biggest problem IHC had was getting the stupid things to break-in. Lots of early Scouts with the IHC 304 or 345 ""SV"" motors couldn't get the rings to seat because the chassis didn't offer the engine enough load to properly break-in. IHC's solution was to tell dealerships to dump a tablespoon of Bon Ami down the carb with the engine running."

4x4,3851o2,-Thunderbear-,1 point,Tue Jun 2 15:39:40 2015 UTC,Front right on 94-97s. It's the shaft that comes out of the diff leading to the passenger CV axle. Reasonably sure it's the same on 98+.
4x4,3851o2,Avoidingsnail,1 point,Tue Jun 2 19:22:48 2015 UTC,Does  it lock the front or anything like that?
4x4,3851o2,-Thunderbear-,1 point,Tue Jun 2 19:46:38 2015 UTC,"Sort of. Doesn't function like a locker, but removes the driveshaft disconnect, meaning that now your front shaft spins, so you want to make sure the u joints are good.   When you press the button to shift, the vacuum actuator under the battery pulls the shift fork to engage the front axle, while the electronic motor on the t case shifts into 4HI.   The Bravada mod removes the vacuum actuated part of the 4WD shift system, leaving just the electronic transfer case shift part."

4x4,382kb5,in_the_blender,3,Mon Jun 1 11:54:44 2015 UTC,"Depends on the terrain you are wheeling.  For the rocky terrain in CO and UT I wouldn't be without my selectable lockers front and rear.  But I know Oz had more gravely trails, mud and rut holes than rock crawling.  We all wheel on a budget. So I forgo the light bars, pre-fabbed bling and other niceties to sink money into the functional bits like lockers and gearing.  Buy once, cry once.  I'm not a fan of the auto lockers, especially the lunchbox lockers. They are brittle and prone to breakage. Put stress on your diff cross pins. Don't behave that well at the best of times. If one grenades and takes out your diff you'll be in for far more than doing it right in the first place and never having to worry about a locker breaking.  LSDs usually only engage after a good bit of wheel spin. So you'll be tearing up the trail a bit and won't have the same control as a proper locker."
4x4,382kb5,BlokeInTheMountains,1 point,Mon Jun 1 17:48:41 2015 UTC,"I ran an aussie in the front and lsd in the rear in my YJ. The lsd did good work when it wanted to, but it seemed to act like an open diff a bit of the time. Once I got it locked it was night and day between the two. It would probably be okay for a street setup I geuss it depends on what trails you run.   My rear axle with the lsd was an 8.8, which is a pretty aggressive lsd.   Right now I've got an aussie/lincoln locker setup and it works extremely well but is interesting to say the least on pavement. I've taken it up to around 60 mph ish on the pavement and I didn't notice I had lockers. Going slow turning in parking lots is the only time I noticed chirping on pavement."
4x4,382kb5,asadog,1 point,Mon Jun 1 16:21:37 2015 UTC,"Go the Autolocker if that is what you want,   There are advantages to then, like a lot less maintenance. But do not by a cheap one from America.  Yes they are ALOT cheaper from the US, but there is no support if it grenades. There is absolutely no recourse.   I got mine installed by a professional as well, he was able to set it up right. I have had zero problems with it. Its just important to treat it with respect and understand its limits.  Get Manual locking hubs as well for the front if you go Auto,  My setup is the LOKKA in the front, LSD in the back. The LSD is tightened up and serviced recently. The damn truck goes anywhere I point it.  With how light a Jimny is, an Autolocker should be fine."

4x4,382kb5,lukefwjross,1 point,Tue Jun 2 03:36:15 2015 UTC,"Don't drop the clutch?  The dog gears will disengage well before the CV's snap, you wont have a problem there, and if you are not applying power it will be unlocked.  I have never seen a CV snap with one from anything other that a bad installation (Preventing Unlock) or someone giving it way to much power (With good traction). One would argue if anything they save the CV's from alleviating the shock load when the wheel suddenly gets traction in bad conditions."

He slid off the road doing about 35mph last winter to avoid a deer and ended up going through a telephone pole and walked away unscratched. It still ran but it was totalled.  I would say it's a safe, kickass, off roader.       The xterra is also an awesome off roader. I've been through swamps, mud, sand, you name it, and have only gotten stuck a handful of times.

After market support isn't near what there is for Toyota or jeep but it is still doable. Of you are looking to be doing serious climbing or hardcore off road it won't be as good as a XJ since it doesn't have a solid front axle. The suspension works well for desert Style off roading and with good driving can do decent in bigger stuff. The engine in these are rock solid, just make sure the timing belt is changed (every 100k.) if you pick one up head over to the pathfinder forum, search Google for NPORA. Lots of good info on upgrades and general knowledge."
4x4,380cob,whitemagic420,2,Sun May 31 23:27:56 2015 UTC,Your 1991 was body on frame also. This 1998 would've been a unibody vehicle and that kind of had me worried.

4x4,37xn85,ikidd,6,Sun May 31 13:44:50 2015 UTC,A bit of story behind it. Drive lost control and went over the edge of the road. He rolled once and landed about 25 feet down the ravine. Took 4 winches with snatch blocks to pull is back up. Truck started just fine afterwords. The owner fire sold all the aftermarket stuff off the truck at camp and then insurance came and claimed it a couple days later. All the aftermarket stuff was replaced by the buyers oem stuff.
4x4,37xn85,hillna,2,Sun May 31 15:48:30 2015 UTC,"I've been wondering how insurance handles cases like these, off-road, where you're pushing your limits. Is it basically the same as any other 'accident,' or is there a way they can deny the claim? I'm getting into off roading with a 2014 Jeep and while I do not push my limits, I am curious how this is handled."
4x4,37xn85,BlokeInTheMountains,2,Sun May 31 19:31:14 2015 UTC,"He wasn't really 4wheeling when it happened, he went off the state run road on accident. So in this case they just totalled it out and will give him enough to repurchase the vehicle in stock from. It's a conversation you should have with your insurance company if you are concerned about it."
4x4,37xn85,mkosmo,0,Sun May 31 21:21:03 2015 UTC,"In this case he was on a county road. So insurance covered it.  Had it been on the trail, no chance.  But he only had insurance for the base model truck and not all the bolt-ons and upgrades. Hence the fire sale before handing the truck over to the insurance company."
4x4,37xn85,coldzer0,2,Sun May 31 19:53:47 2015 UTC,Depends on your policy.  Mine would cover it.

4x4,381425,creature_feature,2,Mon Jun 1 02:11:34 2015 UTC,"I just took my club to TSF for Memorial Day weekend. Took an extra two days off of work because I figured there would be a snowball's chance in hell of getting a camp site at Browns Camp on that weekend. Turned out that wasn't enough and the campsite was still full even on Thursday. This may have just been because of the holiday weekend but I would still have a plan B. Ours was to stay at Elk Creek campground and we all left at the end of the weekend thankful that Browns Camp was full as Elk Creek was a much more serene atmosphere and was over all just a great place to camp. For the trail information see this .pdf : http://www.oregon.gov/odf/tillamookstateforest/docs/OHV_Maps/OHV%20Guide%202014.pdf  You will want to stop at the ranger station, lees camp store, or one of the gas stations on HWY 6 and get the physical copy of that map. I also highly recommend downloading the gps tracks to a tablet and utilizing a gps app such as Gia, Backcountry Navigator Pro, etc. That made trail navigation a breeze for us. The tracks can be found here: http://www.oregon.gov/odf/tillamookstateforest/docs/OHV_Maps/TSF%20OHV%20Trails%20(Class%20II%20and%20IV).gpx  As far as your vehicle and what trails will be suited to you. I highly recommend the Archers Firebreak trail system, cedar tree, hogs back, hood raiser, and saddle up + dog leg. Be prepared for a lot of hill climbs. That is the main thing you will find on those trails. There will be some rock crawling sprinkled in as well however there are intense hill climbs on almost every one of those trails. Just keep the smooth consistent throttle through and you'll have a great time. Best of luck.  P.S. I took a GoPro with me so you will find very up to date footage of all the trails here: http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtuUSteXtoBRXIX61yHYsqw/videos"

It's really fun, but there are some things I don't like:   the plot isn't my favorite, as I prefer to be out in the wilderness rather than by a barn. If you put this engine into a forest/rocky trail style holy crap that would be the perfect game. traction takes getting used to, but isn't too bad. I feel like it would be a really cool add on to be able to control F/R lockers. Ledges seem impossible.  while I really love the first person view, I've always wished that there was a view looking out the window towards the front tire so you see the side of the vehicle. That's how I've seen lots of people wheel, myself included.   The majority of other things are spot on though, such as vehicle movement/body roll, the driveline looks accurate, the difficulty varies which is nice. Upgrades are nice although it would be cool to add more non performance addons, e.g. Lights, removable top where applicable, bumpers, etc. Just for the personalizing aspect. I'm hoping there will be updates, but I haven't noticed any real annoying bugs as of yet.  TL;DR: worth the 4 dollars IMHO, there is still room for improvement though."
4x4,37vkv0,AtlasOffroader,2,Sun May 31 07:33:20 2015 UTC,"Awesome, thanks for the feedback!  Im one person working on this by myself, so i had to make some decisions for the sake of time. I had originally planned on small island that had sections of different terrain types, a foresty area, a rocky cliffside, ect. Its just way too much work for one person unfortunately :/ Truck Trials is something id like to continue though, more offroadyness is certainly on the agenda for a future game, or maybe even an update to this one (id love to expand it so you can leave the farm through that front gate and explore the forest)  Lockers were originally planned as well, i realized early on though that the majority of people didnt understand them and had no idea what they were so i kept it simple for the sake of making it more accessible to a larger audience. Id love to just go all out with a full on hardcore game, all the way down to adjusting gearing or welding your diff when youre tired of wheel spin. but alas, gotta make money and build a reputation first. one day ;) I agree ledges are annoying without lockers, i tried to keep them to a minimum in most levels for exactly that reason  More visual upgrades are certainly on the list of things id like to add in the future. Offroad lights, metal bumpers, exocages, bull bars, ect. At very least i am planning on adding a ""offroad body kit"" where you could just install it all at once. Just gotta find that fine line between intuitiveness for people who dont get offroading, but yet enough in depth stuff for the people who do  There certainly is room in all aspects of the game for improvement, and ill definitely be updating it in the areas where i can!"

4x4,37t9ru,guerochuleta,1 point,Sat May 30 11:08:54 2015 UTC,"Center locking diff would make it AWD, not 4WD, correct?"
4x4,37t9ru,PartyBusGaming,6,Sat May 30 16:04:01 2015 UTC,It will basically be an AWD vehicle until you lock the center diff. Locking it puts you in 4wd. Land Rovers operate on the same principle.
4x4,37t9ru,SuperTraxxasman123,5,Sat May 30 23:29:45 2015 UTC,Best of both worlds. Cool.

4x4,37t9ru,beneficial_eavesdrop,1 point,Sat May 30 19:59:25 2015 UTC,You are all kind of half right. The amarok has a 2.0L biturbo the biturbo means it can tow 3 tonnes or 6600lbs. The manual has high and low range 4wd gear boxes while the auto is high range. They have a 4wd button that changes the breaking and such and enables hill descent control as required. They both also come with a rear diff locker electronicly controlled.

4x4,37l6kf,uglymud,2,Thu May 28 18:43:58 2015 UTC,You can tell it's pre-86 due to the factory front spring hangers.  86 was the first IFS year so and an 86 with solid axle would have an after market spring hanger. They usually have a tube that sits under the front cross member.  Now you can also see the axle has the long factory truss on the underside. This narrows it down to 84/85.  The more you know.

4x4,37idz2,whydidilookthatup,62,Thu May 28 01:20:58 2015 UTC,Disgusting tune.   He needs a better turbo and to learn what those fuel screws actually do.   I'd recommend a Holset he221.
4x4,37idz2,Kiwibaconator,6,Wed May 27 23:16:18 2015 UTC,Can you go into more detail? All my knowledge is with gas engines. What do the screws do? Why do you recommend Holset?
4x4,37idz2,theginger3469,23,Thu May 28 02:50:05 2015 UTC,I recommend the Holset HE221 because I've done a huge amount of work turbo matching for diesels this size and the HE221 is the best match.  The screws on the pump control maximum fuel and how fuel is introduced as boost increases.  These need tuned so max fuel produces safe EGT and minimal smoke at full load.  Then you need to tune the AFC so fuel is introduced in a way to match air-flow.  This gets you maximum performance and mininum smoke with a tune that won't kill your engine.  The amount of smoke shown is overfuelling to the point he's going to melt pistons.
4x4,37idz2,Kiwibaconator,8,Thu May 28 02:55:11 2015 UTC,So overfuelling causes more heat without more power i gather?
4x4,37idz2,MaxDerps,7,Thu May 28 03:42:34 2015 UTC,"Yes, more heat because you don't have the air going through the engine to take heat away.  Less power because all that black smoke is fuel that hasn't been burnt and can't make any power."
4x4,37idz2,Kiwibaconator,1 point,Thu May 28 04:52:52 2015 UTC,Overfuelling causes raw fuel to exhausted with combustion gasses also diluting oil within seals and rings amongst others. Not advised
4x4,37idz2,Vanderlust06,2,Sat Jun 13 09:11:46 2015 UTC,"So that's how people make it so that their trucks can ""roll coal"""
4x4,37idz2,truckmanjones,-4,Thu May 28 19:00:35 2015 UTC,"While I agree with your statement on tuning, I do not agree with the statement about over-fueling. Over-fueling in diesel engines is a practice that has been used for many years. There is a measurable benefit associated with the practice. Introducing an excessive volume of fuel to the combustion chamber actually cools combustion temperature, in turn reducing the temperature inside the combustion chamber and direction on top of the piston. Meaning that the risk of melt down is less likely.   With modern common rail injection and piezoelectric injector systems, calibration (timing or injection and injection quantity) is far more advanced and can develop large HP numbers with virtually no smoke. The 4bt in the Runner is most likely a VE pumped 4bt, not the superior P-Pump model. The VE pump is great, but lacks fine tune-ability.  Smoke or not, diesel swaps - Cummins especially are awesome. Plus, diesel smoke is a great mosquito killer!"
4x4,37idz2,danthehandyman13,1 point,Thu May 28 14:22:00 2015 UTC,This will be a P pump.  A VE pump can only put out ~180cc/1000 shots of diesel which shouldn't create a cloud like that.  But regardless of A pump or VE pump.  The tuning is complete and utter shit.  He's likely got an A/F ratio around 5:1 to do that.  Where best efficiency (best use of injected fuel) is around 18:1.    Is overfuelling to cool combustion good?  No.  Not in any way. It is combustion heat which produces power and drives the turbo.  Adding so much fuel that you suppress temps is one of the dumbest things to do.  Especially for a 4x4 play truck where the goal is a big fat torque curve.  A VE pump 4BT is capable of 300hp completely clean simply by using the right turbos.  It is bullshit like this that will prevent people doing diesel swaps.  The authorities will outlaw it because of dickheads who do a swap and then blow smoke everywhere.
4x4,37idz2,Kiwibaconator,1 point,Thu May 28 20:20:12 2015 UTC,"I am in no way condoning said owners actions or choice on tune. I am simply adding to the conversation.   Can you please explain (as I do not know the answer) why ""performance"" diesels, like those in pulling tractors/trucks and drag trucks produce massive amounts of black smoke? Is it because they are all tuned wrong?"
4x4,37idz2,danthehandyman13,1 point,Thu May 28 22:52:37 2015 UTC,It is because it's harder to tune properly as it takes a lot of brain power to size turbos correctly and ensure you've got enough boost to drive the required airflow.   Those guys dumping fuel are taking the hack method. Look at drags and you'll find the occasional diesel running with virtually no smoke. That's how it is supposed to be.  Their engines last much longer too.
4x4,37idz2,Kiwibaconator,1 point,Thu May 28 23:57:38 2015 UTC,Diesels have to run lean of stoichiometric.   18:1 is as rich as you can run sustained without egt hot enoughto risk melting pistons.  They start to smoke at 16:1 even with best injection equipment.   One of mine cruises at 35:1  and idles at 80:1.
4x4,37idz2,Kiwibaconator,0,Fri May 29 12:05:38 2015 UTC,You are competely and totally wrong.   The garret article you linked to is exclusively for petrol engines and has zero relevance to diesels.   Your figures for ford and international diesels are made up.   Go and drive a diesel with a wideband O2 gauge plugged in and you'll see how wrong you are.   Even looking at the construction of diesel engines should be enough for you to see the massive problems with your claims. They are not air throttled and hence have no ability to maintain a specific a/f ratio.   Seriously. Go learn something before spouting bull shit like this in topics you know nothing about.

I know someone has a shit ton of pictures from Saturday, hopefully they get them up in /r/jeep since I suck at taking pictures.   Saturday a broke a flange adapter and u joint on my 8.8 and has to run Seven mile in front wheel drive. Also wrecked some shock mounts.   Drove clear up to Lehi that night to get a part from my buddy and early Sunday morning on my way to the trails I had a blowout on my tow rig about 10 miles from Moab. Had to wait for a tire shop to open on Monday.   Monday I ran some easy trails solo down Onion Creek where I was camping. Managed to not break anything.   Tuesday we ran Fins and Things and of course me being an idiot taking all the hard lines I ended up breaking another flange adapter and u joint, as well as my leaf pads, a leaf spring bolt, sheared of my exhaust downpipe right at the flange that meets the manifold. Also ended up with a good 7 inch Crack in my transfer case, so that's cool too.

4x4,37dsdz,MattyB4x4,3,Wed May 27 01:40:59 2015 UTC,"I know right?  I've actually gotten a lot of comments about that.  It's a huge problem when we film that hill climbs always look flat, so I have been playing with different techniques to make it look right.    Here the key was to get some of the pre-slope in frame, then I had a guy kneeling below me, and I was leaning over the slope to lend perspective.   The funny part was when she said she wanted to take the ""hard line"" lol.  Kid cracks me up."
4x4,37dsdz,SnuffThePunkz,2,Wed May 27 05:48:08 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that was my first thought too.  I know a lot of people wheel without seatbelts, and hell, I've learned that a lot of people wheel while drinking.  It's bad enough to do that when it's just you and your idiot consenting adult friends, but with a 6 year old?  You should really know better.  Hell, the whole jeep looks fairly custom anyway, build a harness so she can sit in your lap.  It wouldn't even be that hard."
4x4,37dsdz,xpkranger,2,Wed May 27 01:06:00 2015 UTC,"I crawl without belts, but it depends on the trail.  If its above a 20% grade, high speed, or has a rollover chance on they go.   We don't wanna give people heart attacks so we are gonna work on a safety rig to avoid the negative impression in the future. There was pretty tight control over her the whole time."
4x4,37dsdz,this_is_your_dad,5,Wed May 27 05:56:07 2015 UTC,"I crawl without belts   I'm hardly one to cry for the safety police, but that right there is dumb as fuck.  I don't care how careful you are, how slow you're going, how well you know the trails....buckle your damn seatbelt.  People get hurt and die in ACCIDENTS, not carefully orchestrated events where you just flop onto a pallet of pillows.    A lady died in her rock bouncer in a parking lot a couple months ago, a guy died while doing some engine tuning in his mega truck a month ago, I know a guy that dislocated his shoulder and got all f'd up cutting a donut in a parking lot without a seatbelt, I know another guy that was backing off the trailer and his rig slid and he flopped.....I could go on, but I digress.  The point is that ACCIDENTS happen.    My rule is if my rig is moving, my harness is on.  It takes seconds to do and could save your life.  Make it a habit and make it a habit of others around you.  Sorry for the rant, but....too many people in the offroad community are dying because they're too damn stupid to utilize the most simple and effective driving safety device that's ever been made."
4x4,37dsdz,CasinoJustice,2,Wed May 27 14:09:18 2015 UTC,"I have buddies who don't wear them when driving through the mountains or wheeling and it drives me crazy. I was raised to wear them, feels wrong when I'm not wearing it, even when hooking up to a trailer solo and I'm in and out a bunch."
4x4,37dsdz,Balves426,2,Wed May 27 16:52:39 2015 UTC,"Its a valid opinion. It is a good practice. And should that be the message to put out in public, a resounding yes. It is mentioned in the video description for that reason.  That being said.  Its always personal choice what you do. I vary between lap belts or full harnesses. I could be safer, but I think being able to look out the side of the vehicle and pick proper lines makes me safer than being immobilized.  So lets agree to agree. The internet has enough arguments.  Also understand there were precautions and safety concerns taken for the kids, but they aren't really visible in the video, and that trail is not nearly as steep as it looks.  We have discussed it already and are going to make a highly visible seat belting system to avoid complications in future shoots.  Cause she wont ever quit wheeling lol.  :)  Ranting is always ok.

Well it wiped something in his head unit which caused a fan in the back of it to cycle on and off constantly at full speed. Can't hear it when the jeep was running, hemi/loud music. So they got to the camp site, and it kept running after he turned it off... All night... They were stranded for a few days till someone came along and gave them a jump. Had all kinds of crazy electrical issues getting home.  Day before he traded it in (a Sunday when everything is closed) his cv blew on the freeway, so I had to come pull him to the local part store and then in the pissing rain we swapped it. He drove it home and somebody backed into it 5 minutes after he got out of it....  I equated it to a clingy ex who knows her time is up, but is holding on tooth and nail."

They would be stupid not to compete against the TRD Pro and Fiat's Wrangler Unlimited.  Even the Rams are coming with 5-link at this point.   Leafsprings are going the way of front solid axles.     The positives of the new tech way outweigh the negatives.  When a CV axle started costing ~100$ and taking less than an hour to swap in a 4Runner, and breaking less than manual hubs or u-joints, the writing was on the wall.      Now every manufacturer has figured out that rear coils are easier to replace than leafpacks and provide a better ride.     Eventually, RWD with IRS is going to be durable and cheap enough to stick in real offroaders that aren't H1s."
4x4,379m1c,DogFarm,2,Tue May 26 12:37:22 2015 UTC,IRS and IFS still have the problem of lack of articulation because of their short arms in factory setup.  Sure you can get a chinese CV joint for $100 but it will break at the drop of a hat.  RCV CVs seems to start in the $1100 range of IFS rigs versus $600 for a set of birfields for a solid axle.

Which it sounds like you already have done. When you do this, a longer shock isn't going to make any difference since max uptravel and max downtravel don't change unless your front shocks is your limiter for droop, you just lose droop to gain static height.  Lift it off the ground then Disconnect your shocks  if you have more droop with the shocks disconnected than longer shocks may be beneficial.  http://www.pirate4x4.com/forum/newbie-general-4x4-discussion/486331-lifting-1990-daihatsu-rocky-se.html#/forumsite/21027"

Though I've got a question or two that I think you might be able to help me with.  The main reason I was looking at changing/upgrading the front suspension is because it has no uptravel. I did a flex test, for lack of a better term, on a small mound (about a foot tall) and instead of getting flex it just popped the 'roza up with the front left and rear right off the ground. There was no up-travel in the suspension.   I get the feeling this is from the torsion bars being would right out, since they would be massively preloaded. Am I right in thinking this?  Since the car is lifted should I be replacing the shocks also? I doubt this has been done as judging by the other mods the previous owner has done it was all done on the cheap."

4x4,37cr63,deprivedchild,1 point,Sun May 31 21:46:51 2015 UTC,For the rear shocks do I just get the stock length and look for a pair 50mm longer?  I'll likely be replacing the torsion bars with an upgraded pair so I can wind them down while keeping the height. If my research is good then I should be able to maintain my lift with only a 30% wind up on the new bars. Not sure the reference point for the 30% though.  Should the front shock be replaced with longer ones as well since the torsion bars are providing some lift?

I have a Mitzi Canter 4x4 6t Dual cab truck,l have set up with a slide on camper body l custom adapted for it.We have done some great trips into some of the most remote areas of Australia,l set mine up to carry 4 Kayaks and be able to tow my 6mtr dive boat. Then when we get home the Camper comes off and it goes back to my work/farm truck."

I used every inch i could find and gave it a purpose. Im still hooking all the systems up. The side doors im still firguring out how I want  to set them up they offer a ton of space to play with. i designed it with lifting  points i could remove the camper in around 30 to 45mins and have a flatbed truck. It  takes longer to remount and get all bolt holes lined up. This also has a giant pass through from cab to camper that i am really proud of. I left a 4ft flat deck on  the rear to haul things and i may build a sliding tailgate to extend the deck a few extra feet."

The bathroom is in the rear and i could shower on the  back deck by slipping the showerhead out the bathroom window.

Since you said you enjoy building them, and will likely do another maybe some of his techniques will work for you.  He basically took a smaller rv, and reinforced about everything. I can't recall exactly what he used, but basically a rubbery spray in truck liner kind of stuff. This made sure it was mostly leakproof as it was secondhand. He then had a basic tube frame he built reinforcing it to the frame he put it on to make it easier to take on/off his flatbed. Then spray in insulation which helps with the weather, maybe 4""? Then put new siding on the outside of this all. He liked this because it left his windows recessed so tree branches on smaller trails didn't break anything. The rv base gave him all of the basics prebuilt inside so he could focus on making it tougher, but still have the luxuries. Also, you can usually find small rvs for just damn cheap when people get tired of them.   He later on out it onto a tough off duty trailer rig, I think it was surplus, and then towed it with a smaller vehicle to get it more places. I hope to pick up one of these surplus trucks in the not too distant future and do something similar."

If you break down you can call the number on the card and Land Rover will send a flat bed to come get it and bring you and the vehicle back to the nearest dealership. From there you will be issued another Land Rover to drive until your repairs are completed.

4x4,37a4xe,jalpp,2,Tue May 26 21:34:18 2015 UTC,"LOL I have an FJ80 HP elocker and TRD Tacoma LP locker awaiting my gears to come in and a weekend to put it all in. Its not as simple as throwing money at your truck. Got to find the time and the resources to put it all in. Didn't get it done before Tillamook. I wasn't about to let it stop me from going. As you can see I did just fine without them.  Also lockers should be the last thing you put in. Teaches you how to properly wheel your truck without the easy mode that lockers are. I opted for suspension, engine, armor, winch, and high steer first and I'm very happy I did."
4x4,37a4xe,BlokeInTheMountains,1 point,Wed May 27 00:56:50 2015 UTC,"Glad you have the lockers.  But I would not call this ""doing just fine without them"".  You were stuck on the first row of rocks for the first 2.5 minutes of the vid. Spinning tires, stalling, slipping the clutch, rocking back and forth. You only made it over after doing a bit of a dodgy bump that go you tippy.  You can hear the people in the foreground go, ""whoa"" and nervously giggle.  Now, all that didn't break anything this time. But it does fatigue things. R&P, birfs, TREs, trunion bearings etc.  Also, lockers are not easy mode. They don't solve everything. You still have to pick a good line to avoid hanging a diff or DS. You still have to avoid rollovers.  Learning to wheel without lockers doesn't teach you good habits. You get used to doing throttle bumps and avoiding unloading diagonally opposite wheels. Both tend to put you closer to rollover.  Spinning wheels tears up the trails. Landing spinning wheels causes things to break.  We all build on a budget and have to make choices, so I'm not faulting you there. Just hoping you don't become one of those guys who avoids using his lockers for silly reasons and so spins tires and tears up the trails.  There will also be hard trails that are a challenge even with lockers. If you take the easy mode argument to the extreme, then 4 wheel drive is also easy mode and we should be all wheeling crown vics.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KFwPXEeJ3aI  Next thing you need will be a crawl box. Highly recommended. Especially for Moab."

The ""Whoa"" is from my girlfriend who says that to everything because she is like a cat on a hot tin roof when it comes to wheeling. As I said below I was being spotted by a FJ80 driver who had just gone in front of me. He attempted to take me on the same line that he took with his truck that simply did not work for mine. You can hear me in the video tell him that when I walked the obstacle it looked like the right line was better for my truck. Soon as I change to that line things start going a lot smoother for me.  I am stoked for my lockers and look forward to using them and trust me I am not going to not use them because I enjoy wheeling like in this video. I don't enjoy wheeling like this but you have to do your best with what you have and I made it through one of the tougher trails in Tillamook so I'm happy with that.   I got the rear axle with Elocker put in this weekend after a couple of 12 hour days with my buddies. I opted for Nitro 5.29 gears which I then sent off to have cryo treated as well as sending in the side gears to be cryoed as well. Next up will be my complete overhaul of my front axle with RCV, Nitro 5.29, HP FJ80 Elocker and knuckle rebuild."

4x4,375d1d,LetsDoPhysicsandMath,2,Mon May 25 00:47:35 2015 UTC,"Would be helpful to have some info on you're vehicle, but here goes my little blurb on shocks and springs. Shocks act to control the compression and rebound of your springs. If you were to just replace your shocks, you would have more control over your springs and likely wouldn't bottom out as easily. However, under harsh bumps and compression, that spring will still bottom out. A stiffer spring rate will better resist harsh compression, but if you're going to increase your spring rate, you're going to want better shocks that are going to control that spring and keep you from bouncing down the trail and chipping your teeth. Old Man Emu makes great kits that have variable spring rates paired with quality shocks. Again, I have no idea what kind of vehicle you have, but suspension options range from the cheap and easy shocks and springs to full blown race ready coilovers."
4x4,375d1d,rucipher,1 point,Mon May 25 02:38:10 2015 UTC,It's a 2000 Isuzu trooper but unless if I shed out 600 dollars for font springs I can't change the spring rate in the front which I really don't want to do. It's a torsion bar which is why it's expensive. I put new and longer springs in the back but I will do the shocks and go from there. I was looking  at getting the doetsch 8000 which will hopefully improve things a bit.
4x4,375d1d,Boogge,2,Mon May 25 03:43:40 2015 UTC,"Are you bottoming out from fast driving? Springs are suppose to just hold you up at ride height. The shocks should be doing all the work of dampening. The problem with stock shocks is they are small and loose their ability to damped properly after driven offroad for a bit. All the energy they absorb from dampening turns into heat which decreases their effectiveness. If it's slower driving offroad I would suggest some stiffer valved shocks. If it's faster I would suggest some larger shocks such as fox or bilstein, or less expensive FOAs. The bonus for these is that they are rebuild able and you can valve then exactly how you want them. The larger shocks will dissipate the heat faster and not fade as fast. Also look into better bump stops to prevent damage to the suspension from bottoming out."
4x4,375d1d,Kiwibaconator,1 point,Mon May 25 06:15:17 2015 UTC,Yep.   Spring rates are calculated using sprung mass and a natural frequency of around 1hz for the front axle and about 10 to 15% faster frequencies in the rear axle.   Then you need to calculate spring length using desired ride height and the above spring rates.

O2 sensors are not hard, and ball joints are somewhat minor.   I'd say stick with what you know. Depending on how bad this rust is though.   A pickup bed is useful, and you have to be critical about why he wants to trade you.   If you do decide to trade take it a mechanic and have a total look over done; not his mechanic."

4x4,37019l,-ll--ll-,2,Sun May 24 01:23:51 2015 UTC,Pre 95 there was no such thing as a Toyota Tacoma. It was just called Toyota Pickup in the US. Available with 22re (2.4 4 cycl) or 3vze (3.0 V6) with torsion bar IFS.  Hilux was still solid front axle and had more engine choices (diesels).  Not sure if the extra cab made it to Aus -- mainly the 4 door ute and surf (4runner).
4x4,37019l,roflmaohaxorz,2,Sun May 24 01:32:00 2015 UTC,"Extra cab did make it to Australia but only as an SR5, so it had a solid front and was only available in 2.8d straight4 or 3.0 V6 petrol engine."

Money better spent elsewhere.  Only mall crawlers need massive lifts past what is need to clear rubber.  Jump on any serious off road forum and the name of the game is building as low as you can as wide as you can with the biggest tire diameter you can.  Tall trucks roll over.

It still has a shorter roofline than a stock Full Size Bronco with a similar stance.  I don't feel its unsafe at all as I pushed it to its limits this past weekend and drive it to work all week."
4x4,36xnuj,You_chose_wrong,1 point,Sat May 23 03:30:06 2015 UTC,Yup.  I'd actually prefer my truck lower. Unfortunately the frame on the IFS trucks doesn't hoop up that much at the front so you need a certain amount of lift just to get a solid axle under there.  I'd also rather drag guts than worry about flopping.  Did you have factory fuel tank armor?

4x4,36shc9,V4refugee,9,Thu May 21 23:12:56 2015 UTC,It's the angle. Just look at the left wheel.
4x4,36shc9,ELI7E,6,Thu May 21 21:09:12 2015 UTC,The pivot point would put the tire into the end of the bumper. Those wheels are on spacers and/or on aggressive offset wheels.
4x4,36shc9,BlokeInTheMountains,7,Thu May 21 21:49:36 2015 UTC,The wheels are probably on backwards.

4x4,36r620,Hansafan,2,Thu May 21 16:55:53 2015 UTC,EPA regulations I guess.  And I guess they assume no one will buy one.  And Manual trans is on its way out too. They are offering that less and less in cars and trucks here. Its all EPA gas mileage regulations.
4x4,36r620,ruheorama,2,Thu May 21 17:01:40 2015 UTC,"Previously automatic transmissions were easier to operate but were outperformed by manual transmissions in both gas mileage and power. Automatic transmissions have been gradually increasing over the years (like the difference between my 4 spd auto wrangler and an 8 spd auto Ram) to a point where they are beginning to surpass the performance of manuals. Combine that with the decreasing popularity of driving stick and it's really a no-brainer that manuals are being transitioned out. That's why I'm going to drive the wheels off my manual '15 Tacoma, I fear that even a manual tacoma's days are numbered."
4x4,36r620,Kiriesh,2,Thu May 21 19:26:13 2015 UTC,"where they are beginning to surpass the performance of manuals   Yep, in the Ford Falcon BF XR6. The gearbox is the German ZF 6 speed auto with tiptronic, same used in BMWs.  Ive read and heard having 2 stock BF xr6s, 1 with the ZF gearbox and 1 with manual, the ZF is a whole second faster in drags, while thats not huge it goes to show the high end autos are better then manuals. I guess these days a human cant compete with a computer."

4x4,36r620,ruheorama,1 point,Fri May 22 10:25:22 2015 UTC,"It has more to do with production, and the notorious chicken tax.  If a vehicle can be labeled as a commercial vehicle, the import tariff like triples over normal. So Toyota would have to invest in not only making the truck in north America, but the diesel engine as well.   Ford had to import their transit connect vans from Turkey with glass windows and seats as passenger cars, then remove the seats and glass to make them commercial vans. Just like how Nissan is buying Cummings diesels for the new titan rather than using one of their own engines from around the world."

4x4,36r620,live9free1or1die,1 point,Thu May 21 20:52:17 2015 UTC,This is STILL the case? Usually I just hear about the 20+ year old ones.
4x4,36r620,BiasedBIOS,3,Thu May 21 16:51:21 2015 UTC,"Landcruiser ute is the king nowadays, unlike 20 years ago when they were both very reasonable tough trucks. The modern hilux is very complicated compared to the 70 and the hilux of old, but works well when it isn't broken. If it does break however, you're stuffed - IFS & shonky engines, unlike the more robust & repairable 70 series."
4x4,36r620,IvanLyon,0,Thu May 21 21:41:07 2015 UTC,"they're still pretty good and certainly the truck to get if you want reliability (and don't want to spend G-Wagen prices, or you don't live in a country where they sell Landcruisers in pickup form), but the build quality isn't what it was and there's a ton more electronics just sitting there waiting to go wrong. I've a mk4 at the moment, and whilst it's got a bit more power than my old mk3, it's definitely not as robust.   The D4D Hilux engine is pretty stunning and like 90% of Hilux engines (the exception being some of the earlier 2.4L) if you look after it properly it will go for a long time. Not quite as bulletproof as the straight 6 Landcruisers, but they're twice as good as what else is normally found out there."

4x4,36o7lk,duwap73,18,Wed May 20 20:41:06 2015 UTC,The lift is fine; it just needs bigger tires.
4x4,36o7lk,fsacb3,1 point,Wed May 20 23:51:35 2015 UTC,Bigger tyres would need a guard chop.
4x4,36o7lk,Kiwibaconator,25,Thu May 21 06:59:58 2015 UTC,Looks cool but I would be concerned about stability with that much lift.
4x4,36o7lk,mcguinness91,1 point,Wed May 20 22:33:58 2015 UTC,As a former 60-series owner I would be too. They can be a bit top heavy already. Hope they at least went with wider wheels or spacers for a little added stability.
4x4,36o7lk,irish1185,1 point,Thu May 21 15:46:37 2015 UTC,Lift is fine as long as the spring over was done correctly.  Cut and turn the axles and so on..

4x4,36o7lk,Kiwibaconator,3,Wed May 20 21:11:13 2015 UTC,I see this rig a couple times a month and to me the best part is the fact that it had a diesel in it. Sounds like an old Frito Lay truck passing you by. So sick!
4x4,36o7lk,Melburnian,1 point,Fri May 22 03:09:59 2015 UTC,That could explain the ridiculous lift. The 4bt engines are quite tall and in some vehicles need a lot of lift.

Now I know stuff all about that particular engine as they weren't available in Australia, from memory we had the R28 and the diesels. Running gear, chassis, body ect: one word would be bulletproof. They barely changed them at all in 20+ years. I prefer coils over the leaf springs, but each has its own merits. I've got a 2012 y61 version, and I'm pretty sure it still uses that same diff/transfer/and gear box. Solid car.  Price though?? That seems oddly high for an old car. But seems like it's warranted from what you say. You'll enjoy it"
