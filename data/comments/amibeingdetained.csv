But if you use Zip Codes to send mail (not making this up), obtain a driver's license or file a 1040, then you have consented to being defrauded by the government.  In truth, the government is operating fraudulently.  The original secret version of the Constitution makes it clear that we are all independent citizens of our own personal sovereignty.  Also, the only official whose authority you must obey is your county sheriff, or a posse lawfully appointed by the sheriff to sit as a jury in judgment of you.  And all attorneys are traitors, by accepting the foreign nobility title of Esquire.

Read the PDF linked here:  http://ablawg.ca/2012/10/30/the-organized-pseudolegal-commercial-argument-opca-litigant-case/  I'm interested because I became fascinated by them in law school after reading US v. Cheek, 48 US 192.  It's about a guy who actually got an evasion conviction overturned.  His arguments were crazy, but the supreme court agreed that a higher standard of proof was required. The government didn't prove that Cheek knew he was committing tax evasion.  Cheek was convicted again on retrial -- jury found that he did know.  You can also google for ""idiot legal arguments"" and find a link to an exhaustive list of arguments that have been attempted and shot down by federal courts.  It's mind-blowing.    Oh, and the 14th Amendment doesn't apply to white people.  And the income tax is illegal because Ohio was not lawfully a member of the Union when the 16th Amendment was ratified."
amibeingdetained,3e0mah,taterbizkit,4,Tue Jul 21 02:25:50 2015 UTC,"Holy cow. You're my new favorite person.   Also, I don't understand that tax evasion case. Or, to be more accurate, I understand it a little better because after someone asked an explain it like I'm five question the other day about whether or not ""ignorance of the law"" is a valid defense. I sort of understand it, but I'm pretty sure it won't get me out of a speeding ticket (which has to be about the least offensive crime in the world), so I don't know how it could get someone out of tax evasion. But, that's neither here nor there.   Thanks for the reading material. I'm going to prepare myself to be very, very annoyed."
amibeingdetained,3e0mah,the_cornell,7,Tue Jul 21 02:47:35 2015 UTC,"There are some crimes that require ""scienter"" -- that is, specific knowledge that what you're doing is illegal.   The upshot of Cheek was that SCOTUS decided that tax evasion requires scienter.  Without scienter, you'd still have administrative penalties (a tax penalty plus extra interest), but wouldn't be jailed for it.  When Cheek was re-tried under the new rule, the second jury decided that he did in fact have scienter.  Take bank fraud:  Bank fraud does not require scienter.  It requires that you lie on a loan application.  If you knew it was a lie, and you knew it was a loan application, then you can be convicted.  You don't have to know that lying to a bank about a loan application is illegal.  In both cases, though, it is true that ""ignorance of the law is not an excuse"".  With fraud, ignorance does not excuse you from culpability, so it's not an excuse.  With tax evasion, ignorance makes it not a crime in the first place.  Excuse is a type of ""affirmative defense"".  After the prosecution proves each element of the crime (you lied, it was a bank form, the bank could have used the false information to make their decision) you get to put on your defense.  ""I didn't know this was illegal"" is not a defense.  But if scienter is an element of the crime, and you were ignorant, then the prosecution can't even make its case (in theory).  You don't need to present a defense.  You don't need an ""excuse"".  Speeding tickets do not require scienter.  They don't even require knowledge that you're speeding or knowledge of what the speed limit is.  On the far opposite end of the spectrum from crimes that require scienter, are the strict liability offenses.  It only has to be true that you were going 70 in a 60 zone, or whatever.  You ran the red light -- even if you were legitimately distracted and didn't see it change, you ran the red light so you're guilty.  Most strict liability crimes are summary offenses (infractions) or very minor misdemeanors.  Statutory rape is (in most places) a significant exception.  It only has to be true that there was sex, and that the other party was too young to legally consent.  The state of mind and behavior of the minor is irrelevant -- even if the minor lied or deceived the other party into believing they weren't a minor.  Strict liability.  Boomboom?  Yes. Minor? Yes. End of analysis.  One last comment about the crazy people:  This crap persists because there's just enough of a hint of maybe it could be true, that people will fall for it.  Cheek is used by these nutters as ""proof"" that you can win if you do it right.  The OP video is another one.  I'm sure that sheriff deputy wanted to tase the guy, but chose not to.  Dude's a nut, but it's his property and all he's done is yell.  You can imagine what the nut thinks, though.  He's going to tell his friends ""Just yell INDICTED at them"" or keep repeating ""UNDER PROTEST"" or whatever and they'll totally back down."
amibeingdetained,3e0mah,taterbizkit,3,Tue Jul 21 05:08:57 2015 UTC,The problem is this is having a bleed over effect on those who are legitimately trying to improve civil rights of people out there.  I've seen legitimate activists try and pull some of these SC cards such as the three forms of ID without realizing no such thing exists on the federal level and in most states.   Number one thing I try to key in on these days is to see who's the nutter and who is the real deal.  I've generally been able to weed them out by confronting them and asking the specific law they're using to justify certain actions or orders of the government.  So far I've been noticing that the worst bleed over is happening over in a few of the Cop Block chapters but that isn't too much of a surprise there since Cop Block is aimed at being decentralized and would naturally be an attractive thing to gravitate for the SC type people.   One of the other things I've been noticing is the SC are quoting the UCC a lot which definitely doesn't cover the area that they're going off on.
amibeingdetained,3e0mah,davidverner,2,Tue Jul 21 12:31:17 2015 UTC,"SCs believe that all interaction between people boils down to contracts, so the UCC applies to everything.  Even Canadian SCs do this -- they argue that UCC means Universal Commercial Code, and that it applies everywhere in the world.

amibeingdetained,3dky0x,Lampmonster1,3,Fri Jul 17 15:12:52 2015 UTC,"Watching a lot of freemen videos, it was my impression that most of them were attempting to circumvent the consequences of the laws by denying that the law had authority over them. Like, I assumed that they thought they had a good case by reciting certain legal sounding phrases, and so therefore could not be legally detained, or arrested, or tried, or what have you.   What always confused me about that, though, is that surely their denial of personhood, or of ""driving"", or informing arresting officers that they are under protest has never worked, and so at some point you'd think they would realize they got their facts about the law wrong, and that they truly did not have the type of legal authority they thought they had. I mean, if you're lawfully tried and sent to jail enough times (and others in your group are as well), you'd figure whatever legal case you think you have is not as airtight as you thought.  But watching this video made me realize that that's not exactly the point. They may never expect to be taken legally seriously. What they're really are is a member of is a sort of anarchist cult. Their protest is more ideological than it is practical. Which, in my opinion, is sadder, and scarier. Basically its a dangerous cult of people who think they are literally answerable to no one no matter the consequences."

I guess it wouldn't let longer in the US as long as you comply with these simple questions...  I had one control on the road that lasted almost half an hour. After checking my license they asked me to step out of my car and searched me and the car for drugs because I drove through the  Netherlands.

Because you have no reasonable suspicion to believe she's wanted, that's why. Are you mental?  She's a random passenger in a random vehicle that you stopped for a totally unrelated reason. And you're demanding identification so she can prove that she's ""not wanted""?  That's some batshit fucking crazy logic right there.    We can all make fun of Freemen who obviously break the law and refuse to provide the legally required identification.  But it is not ok for police to randomly stop innocent civilians on the street, without any basis for suspicion of illegal activity, and demand documentation proving their innocence.   That's a seriously fucked up mentality for an LEO or anyone in a position of power to have. It's literally ""guilty until proven innocent"" and (supposedly) the absolute antithesis of the entire US justice system. It's also a major driver behind the us vs. them mentality that is becoming such a problem with law enforcement in the US.    The driver could've made things easier by just cooperating from the start but technically he did nothing wrong. And the officer is absolutely in the wrong trying to pressure the passenger with unfounded accusations of criminality. If you're sympathizing with the officer about that part, it's time to step back and reevaluate your stance on policing in the US."

amibeingdetained,3d6kkb,stultus_respectant,3,Tue Jul 14 14:27:27 2015 UTC,"So if I'm not mistaken (and I could be because these fools are nuts) -  The defendant pulled the standard ""How do I know you're a real police officer, show me three forms of ID, are you a peace officer etc!"" sovereign stuff.  Cop wasn't having it and arrested him.   Defendants Trial comes up. He's apparently tight with the Seims so they decide to show up and film. I think there purpose for being there is to present normal sovereign arguments against traffic stops  and act as lawyers. They notify the judge in writing that they want to film, and I guess they took the lack of a reply as assent. When the judge says 'turn off the cameras' they refuse and Nathan Seim gets arrested for refusing to turn of the camera. I imagine the judge was about to rule on the request and didn't get a chance to do so. Of course before the ruling you can't actually film. So once Nathan Seim gets hauled out for Contempt, Gavin Seim runs in, jumps on the chair, yells at the judge and gets arrested, also I'm betting for contempt. The rest of his nutball family also got arrested apparently. Plus a few people were warned about filming after the trial had restarted.   So this video is Gavin's lawyer's closing argument at Gavin's contempt trial. Judging by an earlier posted video the jury didn't buy the argument and convicted him, Gavin seems to think this is because of the miserable jury pay and free doughnuts."

amibeingdetained,3d3fss,TheDroopy,-29,Thu Jul 16 02:16:04 2015 UTC,"I think it's perfectly excusable.   It's incredibly easy to kill someone with a punch to the head. In fact, a family friend killed someone in a bar fight from doing just that.   Self defense exists only as long as until you can make your escape. Camera guy threw the security guard off of him - that's when he had his chance to bolt.   After he threw him into the wall, he jumps on him, and starts drilling him in the face.   This means that the security guy has the chance to defend himself. He took that chance by trying to shoot the guy that could very well have killed him.   Don't want to be shot? Don't attack the guy with the fucking handgun.   I think that's pretty goddamn straight forward.   I don't think the occupancy of the room factors into this at all. This is a risk everyone tacitly accepts when they're in an area with armed guards. If you don't want to find yourself in a situation where you could be potentially be caught in the crossfire of a gun fight - don't go places where armed security is present. Or into warzones. Or into gang territory. Or any night club where Puff Daddy is present.   EDIT: Thanks for the downvotes. Here's hoping some idiot punches you in the face a shitload of times. It's completely safe, doncha know."
amibeingdetained,3d3fss,gasfarmer,17,Mon Jul 13 13:33:18 2015 UTC,This wasn't a barfight in a dangerous neighborhood. This was an assault in the middle of the day in a courthouse full of officers. In fact by the time he pulled his gun and fired he was already being helped by another officer.

Firing a gun is no joke and much more dangerous than receiving a couple of blows to the head from an old skinny man.
amibeingdetained,3d3fss,ATrustworthyPuppet,-27,Mon Jul 13 18:03:24 2015 UTC,"This wasn't a barfight in a dangerous neighborhood.   So being punched in the head is only dangerous in a bar fight in a dangerous neighbourhood? Sweet. I'll get the word out.    This was an assault in the middle of the day in a courthouse full of officers.    One of which was being assaulted. So I'm not entirely sure what your point here is.    In fact by the time he pulled his gun and fired he was already being helped by another officer.    It took his partner forever to react. He isn't omnipresent and all knowing. All he knew is that he had to stop the assault on him now.   He knew the following: I'm being punched in the head.   You act as if he was able to 'sense' where his partner is or some bullshit.    He fired while falling and not even looking at his target or whether there was an innocent behind his target.   Again, I really fail to see how this becomes a part of the criticism.   Do you think that the situation was in his control? That shooting while falling was a conscious decision?   Christ Almighty. I'm not physically capable of this level of cognitive  dissonance.   Here's what buddy knew:  1- He was being attacked.   2- He's probably not going to survive this if the attack continues.   Everything else couldn't be more irrelevant. It doesn't matter if he was in a crowd, or they were alone on the arctic tundra. He felt his life was in danger - so he was doing everything in his power to protect himself.   As is his right as a human being.   There's no time to sit back and consider outside factors. A situation like that happens in seconds. All he knew is that he had to shoot to survive; which he did.   You can argue the morality of it all you want; but the ethics are on lock.   He carries a gun for a reason, and that was the reason in its entirety.    Firing a gun is no joke   I'm glad we agree.    much more dangerous than receiving a couple of blows to the head from an old skinny man.   Bullshit.  1- I strongly disagree with how you're twisting the narrative here by saying ""old skinny man"". That's as bullshit as saying that Mike Tyson should be okay with being punched repeatedly in the face by someone, because ""he's Mike Tyson.""   That's shitty arguing, and I won't allow it.   2- Here's a crazy thought - if you don't want to risk being shot, then don't attack the guy holding the fucking gun. The ""journalist"" is the stupid fuck who brought fists to a gun fight.   This all would've been avoided if he didn't attack buddy against the wall; but instead took the exit from the situation when it presented itself. That's when he turned the corner from victim to assailant.   This is like being mad at me for chopping your arm off, because you attacked me while I was holding a machete.   3- Bullshit about blows to the head not being dangerous. I'll have my grandfather punch your face into the wall a shitload of times, and then you can tell me how not dangerous, and actually quite pleasant, it felt."

I agree in the sense that the guard probably should have said ""You can't be filming in here, put that down or we're going to confiscate it"" or something like that. He shouldn't have just reached out and tried to snatch it.   But to respond to that interaction by launching up into the air and repeatedly punching the guy in the head over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over was an extreme overreaction.

If you are attacked by a person with a firearm, you don't push them away and hope for the best. Once you react in self defense you have to incapacitate your attacker and eliminate the threat to your person.  In this case, mr. Camera man failed to do that. His attacker was still able to draw his firearm and continue the threat with deadly force. He was very lucky he missed.

That would have to be some major disruption in the court proceedings.  There have only ever been three people in the entire United States to be charged, both, civilly and criminally with contempt of court.  A friend of mine was one of those people. He refused to answer questions of a federal grand jury, so they made an example out of him and gave him jail time and fined him.  Federal grand juries have some fucked up rules.

amibeingdetained,3cxrft,nerogenesis,5,Sun Jul 12 14:46:08 2015 UTC,Is that possible?
amibeingdetained,3cxrft,ShigglyB002014,103,Sat Jul 11 19:52:11 2015 UTC,"No, it is not possible. Here is why.   These people, sovereign citizens or freeman people, believe they only have to abide by common law (basically case law, which are laws passed by judges in cases), and do not respect statutory laws (laws made by legislature and governments, so basically state laws). They are radicals who believe in radical ideas that don't actually work, they just believe it does. Most of them get their research from google, and if you google ""Driver license vs the right to travel"" you will get a crap load of websites that are dedicated to their cause, most of them are copies of each other. So basically they copy the work of another and post it like its accurate and legit. Just like most of these videos you see, they believe if they spout off certain verbiage that will confuse police and judges and get away with whatever law they are breaking.  So the issues that you typically see in these videos are:  1)I am traveling, not driving. 2)I'm in an automobile, not a motor vehicle.  Now those explained and why they are wrong:  1)Using their logic, they don't believe they need a drivers license because they have a right to travel. They believe drivers license are only required for commercial use, not personal travel. They also believe that drivers license came from the statutory law (which they don't believe in) and not common law so they have no requirement to get one (which is wrong).  They get their logic from case law, most of which is archaic, dating back late 1800's or early 1900's. They basically look at rulings or opinions by judges, and look for unique sentences or paragraphs that fit their cause, and then cherry pick them to make it sound like they have a leg to stand on. Example:  Routh vs. Quinn, 20 Cal 2d 488 ""No statutory duty lies to APPLY for, or to POSSESS a driver's license for personal travel and transportation as as defendant is not within the class of persons for whose benefit or protection the statute was enacted.""  However... Routh vs. Quinn, 20 Cal 2d 488 (http://scocal.stanford.edu/opinion/routh-v-quinn-25634) had nothing to do with drivers' licenses and you will not find the passage quoted, it's about tax law. So it's just a bad quote entirely.   The next one they typically use for right to travel is:  Thompson vs. Smith, 154 S.E. 579 at 583 ""The right of a citizen to travel upon the PUBLIC highways and to transport his property thereon in the ordinary course of like and business is a common right which he has under his right to enjoy life and liberty, to acquire and possess property, and to pursue happiness and safety.""  Which is an accurate quote from the opinion, however, Thompson v. Smith did not rule that requiring a driver's license was unconstitutional. In fact, immediately following the part quoted, the court stated that it was well within the city's right, under its police powers, to regulate the use of its streets by private automobiles by issuing, refusing, and revoking such permits. http://scholar.google.ca/scholar_case?case=3467100988685921366&hl=en&as_sdt=6&as_vis=1&oi=scholarr&sa=X&ei=-KDeUpqOEonyoASJ-YDoDQ&ved=0CCwQgAMoADAA  So they claim that it's a constitutional right to travel, which nowhere in the constitution does the words travel, drive, automobile, or motor vehicle ever appear. They are just dead wrong, and instead believe they get the right from case law, again which is wrong as you can see above, because they misquote or omit, opinions so that it fits their cause.    They get the idea that driver license is only required for people conducting commerce, and cite this:  DRIVER  The term ""driver"" in contradistinction to ""traveler,"" is defined as:  ""Driver -- One employed in conducting a coach, carriage, wagon, or other vehicle ..."" Bovier's Law Dictionary, 1914 ed., Pg. 940  As you can see they are quoting a dictionary from 1914! Hence, they say they are traveling, not driving because driving is regarding commercial use only. WRONG. They also prefer to say they are not driving, because, in most state laws, the term used is driver or driving, so they believe if they use a different term it helps them circumvent the law.  Also most of the opinions they quote about traveling, are pertaining to cases regarding passports and judges ruling that no one state can deny access of any US citizen into their state, that they must have the right to travel between them freely. Which we do enjoy, I can go to Arizona, Florida, New York, and not worry about a damn thing. And they are also right when they say they have a right to travel, they can, they can travel by foot, horse, bicycle, or hire a taxi or bus. But that does not mean they are free to drive on the roads without paying their fair share of taxes (vehicle registration fees and such) which go to maintaining the roads and building them in the first place. Hence driving is a privilege, not a right.  2)Now on to why they are in an automobile, not a motor vehicle. They say that according to case law, as well as 18 U.S. Code § 31 - Definitions, (6) Motor vehicle.— The term “motor vehicle” means every description of carriage or other contrivance propelled or drawn by mechanical power and used for commercial purposes on the highways in the transportation of passengers, passengers, and property, or property or cargo.  So again you see reference to motor vehicle applies to anyone using it for commercial purposes. What they fail to understand is that Federal law is and only governing commercial drivers which only applies to those engaged in interstate commerce. Federal Laws do not govern driver license for all citizens because otherwise there would be a Federal driver licenses, instead of individual State driver licenses. State law applies to everyone in the state, regardless whether they are engaged in commerce or pleasure use. So the definition you see above, 18 U.S. Code § 31, only talks about commercial purposes because that is all the Federal government can regulate.  Also, they prefer to say automobile instead of a motor vehicle, because most State laws use the word motor vehicle, instead of an automobile. So they avoid saying they are a driver of a motor vehicle, instead they are traveling in their privately own automobile. They believe this somehow circumvents the state laws and thus they don't apply to them.   But time and time again, they get pulled over, cited, even arrested. Court happens and they are found guilty. They also think they can make outrageous claims of money being own to them for their time, $250,000 for each 15 minutes they are detained on a traffic stop because it's in their paperwork. Yet you notice how none of them are ever rich? Because plain and simple none of this works.   TL:DR, No this isn't possible. They are misinformed people who pick certain sentences from opinions by judges that fit their cause, even though majority of the time they are either misquoted, not about driving/traveling, or about driver license, or they fail to quote the opinion in its entirety, which gives the foundation of why a judge would have said that sentence in the first place. Most of the cases aren't even about driving/traveling/license, but instead about passports, tax issues, etc.  The best things police officers can do is ignore them, ask for what is required, and if they try to hand them any of their crap paperwork that they try to make look official, to not accept it and only deal with their driver license, registration and proof of insurance. Makes these go a lot quicker."

All the laws were created by other people, mostly now long dead.   I think a lot of these people have strong ideas about freedom and individuality and then it just takes a push in the right direction and off they go. I mean, some of the questions are reasonable ones. For example - I'm Australian but I was also born on Earth so why can't I go stand on some other bit of the Earth without a piece of paper saying I can? Why are other members of my species so hung up on rules about where I stand?  That's just one example of an almost philosophical question that is perhaps enjoyable to think about but if you take it too seriously you start deciding to accept or reject laws based on whether you like them or not.  Some of them are probably a bit crazy too but it's important to remember that many of them are earnest in their beliefs, are not entirely mental and sometimes their ideas are worth examining. For example, right now our Government is discussing making us show ID to fly interstate within our own country because terrorists. A sovereign citizen might have a problem with this and this isn't entirely unreasonable."

I did it also because like you when I first encountered them I was curious and didn't have a good explanation as to who they were and why they acted like that. I just like to be able to intelligently argue with them, so I did a few hours of research and found others who argued with them as well, and compiled rebuttals. I feel I understand them better now, and if I wanted to be like them, and I did a simple Internet search, and I found what sounded like intelligent arguments as to why their way was the right way, I would believe it too. But that would also mean I would have to take for granted whatever they posted online from all these copy and paste websites rather than verifying what they claim, most of which don't go verify otherwise they would realize it was all bat shit crazy stuff.

amibeingdetained,3cpgvc,mc_hambone,6,Fri Jul 10 12:05:54 2015 UTC,"The cop gave him plenty of chances, it was only after the point of no return, where he was going to hand over his information.    You know what would have been easier than doing what he did? Handing over his information, taking his tickets, and going about his way. Instead, he thought it was a great idea to waste their time, not give up his information, get arrested, go to court, pay more money than he would have if he just took the tickets.    Remember that these people vote and reproduce."
amibeingdetained,3cpgvc,AlexatRF21,3,Fri Jul 10 14:26:11 2015 UTC,"I wish more cops would resort to arresting these bozos. I think they are within reason to arrest them after just one or two refusals. Once it's obvious they are just arguing for arguments' sake and not being cooperative even though they understand exactly what is being asked and why, just book them. Once they get a couple of marks on their record and wasted a few half-days at the station, they'll stop (maybe)."
amibeingdetained,3cpgvc,mc_hambone,2,Fri Jul 10 20:56:44 2015 UTC,"The problem is that many of the people involved with this type of legal loopholes will take enormous amounts of time for the officers, judges, clerks, etc. They are essentially leveraging their only commodity, time. When an officer / judge / clerk is sued and a lien is placed against his their primary residence - it's a big waste of time. Several of these arrests have incited massive amounts of personal legal issues with the individuals involved in the matter - none of it can actually stick in court, but it's a wager. 1) Is this encounter worth the hassle of me defending my ownership of my home? 2) What is the outcome if I do nothing? It's a tough decision - which is why so many of these videos end with the officer doing nothing - it's simply not worth the hassle."
amibeingdetained,3cpgvc,TapThemOut,3,Sun Jul 12 01:49:22 2015 UTC,I believe there is an issue once you start placing someone under arrest by opening their door and putting your hands on them and then taking it back because of claims that he will give you the required documents. Use of force is only really required to issue an arrest and if they stopped that he could claim 'why do they have to assault me to issue me a ticket.'  Not to mention he would probably just go back to arguing and wasting more time of the officers. You also give him the upper hand to invoke violence if he wanted (considering he knows he is going to jail now).
amibeingdetained,3cpum1,Townsend_Harris,6,Thu Jul 9 20:30:54 2015 UTC,"What kills me about these types are that they say things like, ""Hey, I know you are just trying to do your job and we don't want to interfere"", and, ""we don't want to detain you either..."". Yet, everything they are doing here is solely for the purpose of frustrating the officers and, hopefully, irritating them till they are simply let go because they are not worth the trouble. All their rhetoric and all their arguing is meant to delay the system. Regardless of what they say, we all know they would never accept any answer, law, or higher authority that didn't already agree with their own established legal doctrine."

amibeingdetained,3cpum1,mesopotato,5,Fri Jul 10 16:35:09 2015 UTC,"Sovereign Citizen types use the phrase ""motor vehicle"" as a sort of euphemism for non-commercial vehicles (e.g. personal cars). Many, if not all, State DMVs issue a Commercial Driver's Licence for vehicles that meet or exceed certain requirements and engage in commerce (e.g. poultry delivery trucks).   SCs use of travel instead of driving because travelling is a broad, general term that does not require direct operation (e.g. passenger travel by train, ship, plane). Driving is more specific since it requires direct operation upon something (e.g. driving a car).  Both are inefficient attempts at circumventing traffic, road, etc. laws. All a LEO has to do is point out that they are using public roadways hence SCs are obligated to meet requirements to use them and comply with all applicable laws."
amibeingdetained,3cpum1,Qolx,2,Fri Jul 10 16:54:53 2015 UTC,Thanks for the explanation. Didn't know the part about the CDLs. Is there a law about this or are they being intentionally convoluted to try and confuse LEOs?
amibeingdetained,3cpum1,theaartzvolta,2,Fri Jul 10 17:00:33 2015 UTC,"I'd say that the majority of LEOs with 2+ years in a police dept. are familiar with the basics of traffic laws so it may be difficult to confuse them. Bottom line is the officer will request a driver's license, registration, and proof of insurance. Don't have them or won't show them? Just gave the LEO enough justification to investigate further and take appropriate action.  SCs operate in an echo chamber and believe that specific phrases or words will magically work (amibeingdetained? free to go? blah blah). Most of their philosophy just doesn't work."
amibeingdetained,3cpum1,Nova_Phoenix,1 point,Fri Jul 10 17:11:30 2015 UTC,The closer thing to an answer I've ever heard is something like Admiralty Maritime Jurisdiction deals with commerce and since I'm not being paid to drive I'm only travelling and not under Admiralty Maritime Jurisdiction and thus can travel freely which means I don't need a license and registration.

amibeingdetained,3cfzjs,Mejari,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:40:21 2015 UTC,It's an inanimate object. I don't fear objects for their mere presence. The presence of an object itself shouldn't invoke fear. People on the other hand can be terrifying. People can invoke fear. I don't fear an officer merely due to him openly carrying a pistol. I also didn't fear the first man I met openly carrying a pistol who wasn't an LEO. Because each of these two people presented themselves in a non threatening manner.
amibeingdetained,3cfzjs,Feral404,1 point,Tue Jul 21 07:02:11 2015 UTC,"You honestly find no reason to have some level of fear for an object that has the capability and purpose to kill people? I understand your whole ""guns don't kill people, people kill people"" thing, but I just don't find that argument convincing because I have trouble thinking that any situation without guns would be made better with guns.  I mean, if you saw someone carrying around an anthrax vial, would you not fear it? Even if the person carrying it had it in a safe little box on his belt, having the capability to cause massive destruction just sitting around is still pretty scary.  I don't freak out if I see people with guns, but they do make me generally uncomfortable (except for where they make sense, like hunting or skeet shooting or at the range or whatever), and someone walking around with an AR15 would definitely make me scared, and I don't find that unreasonable."
amibeingdetained,3cfzjs,Mejari,1 point,Tue Jul 21 07:17:18 2015 UTC,"I never said a situation without guns would be made better with the introduction of them. However there are some self defense scenarios where that would have been the case.   A perfect world would be one without the presence of any weapons. But we are humans, and inevitably will create vile ways to destroy one another.   I love my firearms. When I see them, I don't think of murder or violence. I think of a prized possession. A tool. One that I take out to the range and have a relaxing day with. I also think it could be a device that could save my life one day be it from a person or a wild animal.   I wish they didn't exist. But there will always be something out there. Me having one levels the playing field for me.   As a end thought: I don't agree with the open carry of a rifle. Despite the fact I own an AR-15 I wouldn't dare carry it outside a case unless I was out in the sticks and thought I may need it. But the reality is it doesn't have a whole lot of stopping power so there are better options.   An openly carried handgun however: that I firmly believe that if done in a respectful manner is acceptable and shouldn't invoke fear. In fact I was at yet another meet up this month and there was 34 of us, roughly half openly carrying handguns. Many other patrons came up and asked questions while we ate. It was a fun occasion and providing learning opportunities for others."

amibeingdetained,3cfzjs,anonomys1,5,Thu Jul 9 05:44:00 2015 UTC,"You are both correct and incorrect.  I wouldn't use the statistic 'people who should have been shot' though.  To start off with, let's look where you are right.  To do that, we have to look at some statistics about total homicides in England pre and post gun ban.  I drew this up a while back while talking about this exact subject, so I'm going to re-use it.  The green line shows without the trend line without the Shipman adjustment, the red with.  The Shipman adjustment shows where the curve would be without this guy, who was a notorious serial killing doctor. He was suspected to be responsible for 250 homicides, but was only convicted of 15.  Anyway, as you can see, the total homicides in England peak around the time of Shipman (even adjusting for him), and steadily fall back to pre-gun ban levels by around 2009. Accompanying this however, is a 20% increase in the size of the police force. Whether or not you think that's a good or bad thing is up for debate I suppose.  On the flip side of that, 2014 looks to be the lowest number of homicides in England in over 40 years, and it seems to be following that trend in 2015.  Lastly, I would add that it is always preferable that a suspect be brought in than killed.  Not only do I think it's more ethical, it's better for the morale of the state/country, and more than anything else, as a self interested person, I'd prefer getting beaten by the police than shot.

Then they told them they were doing him a favor by giving him a warning-and that things would play out in the courts.  This would really concern me - as I said in another post, there are local cops/courts that are refusing to grant marriage licenses to same-sex couples using this same argument."
amibeingdetained,3cgjau,TheHundredAcreWoody,1 point,Wed Jul 8 17:40:00 2015 UTC,They didn't say the ordinance trumps state law. They said that would be determined in court. They are literally not overstepping their legal territory.

amibeingdetained,3cgjau,TheHundredAcreWoody,1 point,Thu Jul 9 19:10:44 2015 UTC,"You're missing the point. Clearly he is correct that the city ordinance is illegal under the state law. That doesn't matter until court though. The cops still have to follow the rules they are told to follow and that includes city ordinances. These conflicts aren't settled on smart phones in the park, they are settled in court and THEN the standing orders to the sheriffs change."
amibeingdetained,3cgjau,Sgt_ROFLcopter,1 point,Thu Jul 9 19:14:16 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry but as most police officers would agree, ignorance of the law is no excuse.  ""Hey guys, local ordinance says I am allowed to knock down your door if I think you are smoking pot, despite the new state law legalizing marijuana.  I have to let a judge handle it!"".  They do NOT have to enforce an unlawful ordinance, and would be WAY in the wrong if they did so.  In fact they probably opened themselves up legally by admitting that they know that the state law supersedes the local ordinance.  You are 100% correct though, these conflicts are not settled on smart phones in the park.  They are settled by duly elected representatives writing/changing law that is then signed into law by the governor of the state.  NOT in a local court AFTER harassing a (newly) law abiding citizen.  Can you imagine the chaos if every Sheriff/Police Department handled cases like this?  A new law is passed allowing/banning something but they continue to ticket and warn citizens by claiming that despite the fact it is the law they still have to go to court?  I can't think of a single situation where this would be ok with anyone-marriage licenses,  pot legalization, take down of confederate flags from state buildings, red light cameras, etc."

amibeingdetained,3cgjau,TheHundredAcreWoody,-2,Thu Jul 9 17:52:24 2015 UTC,Huh.  Can't tell if serious or sarcastic.  No such thing as a semi-auto machine gun.  Reading the YouTube description it sounds like he was highlighting how the local/county cops were trying to usurp the state law by restricting his rights.  Kind of like what is happening now elsewhere with licenses for same-sex couples.  The local law enforcement have no authority to declare that they their local ordinance trumps a state/federal law.
amibeingdetained,3cgjau,depakoitvs,2,Wed Jul 8 17:37:17 2015 UTC,"Yes, I messed it up. I meant rifle or something. Still, it is a machine gun, right? Kinda like what's happening with marriage licenses? Are you serious? I hope you understand that those licenses are getting denied because people don't like gays. It is discrimination, it is nothing like some retarded walking around with a machine gun expecting that nobody will call the cops. You know, you can't know if it is somebody planning something or just a retarded that wants attention. So the easiest way to deal with it is to call the cops on him anyway."
amibeingdetained,3cgjau,TheHundredAcreWoody,-6,Wed Jul 8 17:42:10 2015 UTC,"No, it is not a machine gun at all.  It is impossible for a civilian to own a machine gun.  If you wanted to purchase a pre-1986 fully automatic (not a SEMI-automatic), it would run you in the $20,000 to $30,000 range.  Basically you are seeing a hunting rifle that looks scary.  Thank you for making my point - discrimination is a matter of denying civil rights to individuals.  In the US the right to bear arms is a literal civil right, codified in the US Constitution.  I don't care if a cop doesn't like it (or the 1st Amendment, etc.).  I don't care if your local ordinance prohibits it (or gay marriage, or the assembling of yourselves together for the purpose of worship or dissent).  The simple fact of the matter is that their opinion does not matter.  It is a right. We might disagree with it but that doesn't make it any less of a right.  To deny someone their right and then try to legitimize that denial by hiding behind a local ordinance is wrong."
amibeingdetained,3cgjau,depakoitvs,3,Wed Jul 8 17:57:58 2015 UTC,"Are you seriously comparing the right to own a gun and carry it to the rights gay people have been struggling to get? Seriously? Hunting rifle? That looks like a sub machine gun for me. But yeah, I cannot disagree, I'm not an expert. Is it a semi auto rifle?"
amibeingdetained,3cgjau,TheHundredAcreWoody,-6,Wed Jul 8 18:05:15 2015 UTC,"I don't need to compare it - the rights to marry (and the pursuit of happiness) again are contingent upon rights that governments are not supposed to deny.  Unfortunately gay marriage was a longer fight.    Would you compare defending freedom of speech as important as the freedom to marry whom one chooses?  Yes, it is a hunting rifle, if not something even less powerful.  ""Machine gun"", ""Submachine gun"", ""assault rifle"", etc. have legal definitions based on their destructive capacity (whether realistic or not).  What you are seeing is not a machine gun of any type whatsoever.  It is the same caliber and performance as a rifle used to hunt deer, coyote, etc.  It requires you to pull the trigger multiple times.  It would be stupid to classify how ""dangerous"" a weapon is just by how scary it looks, so looks simply do not matter."
amibeingdetained,3cgjau,depakoitvs,2,Wed Jul 8 18:10:26 2015 UTC,"But you are comparing it. It is not just about the rights they've been denied, it was not just a ""longer"" fight. You can't be that obtuse about it. Seriously. Have you ever been killed/beaten just because you like guns? Freedom of speech is another sensitive and complex subject, spcially because most people don't really know what it means. But still, not sure what's your point there. What is your point? What does freedom of speech have to do with open carrying guns?"
amibeingdetained,3cgjau,TheHundredAcreWoody,-2,Wed Jul 8 18:16:12 2015 UTC,"Of course I am comparing!  A right is a right!  Just as it would be wrong to deny someone the freedom of speech, the freedom to marry, etc. it is just as wrong to deny them their 2nd amendment right.  Why do you feel that it is different in the case of someone who exercises a right that you do not agree with or feel is important?  Are rights only valid if you as individual agree with them?  Are rights only valid if you are killed or beaten in their defense?  In which case there have been plenty of times in past history where the defense of rights (including the right to bear arms) has resulted in death and injury.    I said nothing about open carry of guns.  But this particular instance is despicable because the officers knew that the man was in his rights under federal and state law (they acknowledged it!) but harassed him anyway under their own authority.  Which is wrong, and an abuse of authority. Which is my point."
amibeingdetained,3cgjau,depakoitvs,1 point,Wed Jul 8 18:21:12 2015 UTC,"A right is a right. But you are comparing a right to be treat as a human to a right to carry an inanimate object unnecessarily. I mean, I'm relatively conservative with guns, but I don't see any explanation as to why you want to carry a rifle on the streets. Was he going to hunt? Or is it just a park? I get it if you want to carry your gun for personal protection, but usually a small gun, pistol, makes way more sense. Not a fucking rifle. And there are videos of some guys walking around with auto rifles like colts and whatnot, that's just stupid. All rights are valid, but some of them are just trivial and dumb, and to be honest, abused."

amibeingdetained,3cgjau,spritef,-1,Wed Jul 8 08:53:14 2015 UTC,"this is true. it was de-escalated almost as fast at it was escalated at the beginning.  i don't doubt the fear that they could have had when they first approached, seeing a guy with an AK and a handgun on his hip.  it just seems that the uniformed cop had his shit more together to approach the guy without a weapon drawn. however, that was likely because he knew that his partner DID have his weapon drawn."
amibeingdetained,3cgjau,twalker294,2,Wed Jul 8 08:59:03 2015 UTC,"For sure. Also if you've got a pro and a reservist, I'm pretty sure you'd want the pro making contact."
amibeingdetained,3cgjau,spritef,-1,Wed Jul 8 09:32:14 2015 UTC,"agreed. i think this is evidenced by the way both of the cops approached the situation.  I'm just talking shit saying he's a reservist. who knows why he's really in civilian clothes, maybe an off-duty cop, and was all that was available in the area.  my whole point to responding to this was, I've seen several videos of these dumb asses that handle themselves poorly, and this guy in the video feared for getting shot by the cop who had a bead on him. i don't think either of them are wrong considering the circumstances though.  if you don't want fucking attention, don't do shit like sling what could be an automatic weapon over your shoulder. At the same time for the LEO side, don't draw down on someone that has done nothing to indicate hostility and is being completely cooperative and isn't shouting fuck the police, and fuck you pig, etc. etc."

Pretty much any of the bases which there is a decent amount of civilians that come inside will have displays all over the place.  Fort Jackson is another one that has a few scattered around and Fort Gordon had one or two floating around also.  I haven't been to those bases in a long time so I don't know if they're still there or not.

Also I am guessing this guy bought a fake uniform because OSI doesn't fucking play with twat donkeys, so the only reason they didn't have him on the ground being tazed is because he is a civilian and outside OSIs jurisdiction.

So everything from articular 4.1.1.1-4.1.1.1.0 we can do while in uniform. 4.1.2.1-4.1.2.16 are all things we can do while we are not on duty (aka out of uniform). 4.2.blahblahblah talks about holding office, which I cannot do due to conflict of interest. This doesn't  keep me from holding office though, it just means I would be separated from the military if I were to run for office. 4.3 is more of the same. 4.4 appears to be specifically for the executive branch of government as well as 4.5. 4.6 talks about how we can separate from the military if we want to hold office.

Suffice it to say I have more experience in military matters, and have attended briefings held by the Area Defense Council (aka Air Force lawyers) for issues that arise from these exact preconceived notions of restricted rights. Briefings where they explain in plain freaking English what we can and can't do. Briefings that we have to attend at least once a year.

Well, if I'm just walking along on my merry way, or carrying an item I have a completely legal right to carry, they don't.  And I don't need to feel like I'm on trial with them, or need to justify my actions with them, unless I am doing something illegal.  I don't need to tell them where I'm coming from, where I'm going, or even why I have said thing that made them stop me (again, as long as it's legal).

It may even be in your best interest to do so.  But half the time with these videos there's no reason other than ""because I can.""  That is being a dick.   What if that person is well within his rights to refuse, then the cop decides to compel him to ID in direct violation of the man's rights and the officer's own department policy? Is the cop being a dick?   Of course. I doubt anyone here would suggest otherwise. This isn't a cop apologist sub.  From what I've seen, the people in this sub don't believe everyone should just bend over and do anything a cop says, only that people should be reasonable, mature adults. They also believe these nitwits who don't think the rules apply to them and who go out looking for confrontations just so they can create these videos are worth mocking.  And let's face it, when you're playing those ""I'm not driving, I'm traveling"" games or go walking through the neighborhood with a rifle and a camera, you are looking for a confrontation.  Even though those people are within their rights -- the latter are, at least, maybe not the former -- they're still dicks. They're dicks because their whole purpose is to create confrontations.

Is the civilian in question blatantly doing whatever the fuck it is he's doing for attention? No one likes an attention whore and no, getting yourself arrested for the most avoidable thing possible doesn't make you an activist. Go lobby your representatives and actually y'know change things. Is the civilian openly hostile? It's usually pretty obvious when people are more interested and ""giving it"" to those 'evul pigz' because they have the mentality of a 16-year-old stoner or a paranoid schizo.   Does the civilian deliberately start shit? I'm not an idiot, like all groups some cops are gigantic pricks who'll go off over nothing. But more often than not the people who make these go out of their way to annoy cops and try to purposely goad them into a 'gotcha' moment which just makes them an asshole.   Going out of your way to piss off police officers doesn't make you a patriot, it makes you a retard whose just asking for it. If you believe a cop has overstepped his authority in some way (which does happen way too often), fight it in court. Videotaping yourself acting like a fuckhead has never helped anyone's case. Ever.  My issue has never been about people having legitimate issues with certain encounters with police. My issue is people acting like spastic cunts and acting shocked when they're thrown in jail. I'll say it again, just follow their orders, give the stupid ID and fight it in court."

This is called reasonable suspicion. It doesn't mean he knows you're doing something illegal. It means he merely suspects you. It's a very low, easily obtained standard. Any jury would see reasonable suspicion from that video.  Once an officer has reasonable suspicion, he can detain you until he alleviates that suspicion. How long he can detain you varies by state, but if the nutjob refuses to provide information that will alleviate that suspicion, he'll be hauled before a judge to decide whether he's released or remains detained (in jail, this time) until he provides such information.

amibeingdetained,3c551k,megabits,3,Mon Jul 6 03:46:48 2015 UTC,"The Fourth Amendment cabins government's authority to intrude on personal privacy and security by requiring that searches and seizures usually be supported by a showing of probable cause. The reasonable suspicion standard is a derivation of the probable cause command, applicable only to those brief detentions which fall short of being full-scale searches and seizures and which are necessitated by law enforcement exigencies such as the need to stop ongoing crimes, to prevent imminent crimes, and to protect law enforcement officers in highly charged situations. Terry v. Ohio, 392 U. S. 1, 392 U. S. 30 (1968). By requiring reasonable suspicion as a prerequisite to such seizures, the Fourth Amendment protects innocent persons from being subjected to ""overbearing or harassing"" police conduct carried out solely on the basis of imprecise stereotypes of what criminals look like, or on the basis of irrelevant personal characteristics such as race. Id. at 392 U. S. 14-15 and n. 11 (citation omitted).  To deter such egregious police behavior, we have held that a suspicion is not reasonable unless officers have based it on ""specific and articulable facts."" Id. at 392 U. S. 21; see also United States v. Brignoni-Ponce, 422 U. S. 873, 422 U. S. 880 (1975). It is not enough to suspect that an individual has committed crimes in the past, harbors unconsummated criminal designs, or has the propensity to commit crimes. On the contrary, before detaining an individual, law enforcement officers must reasonably suspect that he is engaged in, or poised to commit, a criminal act at that moment. See, e.g., Brown v. Texas, 443 U. S. 47, 443 U. S. 51 (1979) (to detain, officers must ""have a reasonable suspicion, based on objective facts, that the individual is involved in criminal activity""); Terry, supra, at 392 U. S. 30 (reasonable suspicion exists only where policeman reasonably concludes, inter alia, ""that criminal activity may be afoot"").

Remember, the SCOTUS 1st Circuit ruled in Glik v. Cunniffe that a private citizen has the right to record video and audio of public officials in a public place. Also, reasonable suspicion is evaluated using the ""reasonable person"" standard. Knowing that citizens have this right and with no evidence to the contrary, I don't see how a reasonable person could conclude that a crime is being committed. Failing the reasonable person test, there is no reasonable suspicion to detain this man."
amibeingdetained,3c551k,not-personal,16,Mon Jul 6 02:14:35 2015 UTC,"I'm well aware of the SCOTUS ruling and am a big fan of it. That being said, I did articulate before the reasonable suspicion:   Standing partially obscured just outside of a police station in the middle of the day, videotaping for no apparent justification, is surely something you can concede the average person would consider suspicious   I was also applying the reasonable person standard to it as well. We just got different results. The reason activity like the gentleman's is considered suspicious in a general sense is because it's very uncommon. We can probably come up with a number of kumbaya reasons for why someone might film a police station at shift change, but the number of potentially more worrisome reasons is inarguably longer. Domestic terrorism is a very real threat, and I find it hard to believe that the majority of people polled on the street as to whether or not someone would probably be up to no good if they're filming a police station under similar circumstances wouldn't say that is suspicious and worthy of investigation. The same exact concern would be warranted at a bank or a junior high volleyball game or a daycare.   As I said in another post, this man is there for no other purpose than to directly antagonize. His only reason for being there is to rouse suspicions and cause trouble. Are police officers flawless paragons of virtue? No, of course not, but the man filming isn't some noble warrior out to right wrongs. He wasn't targeted for being black or being from another country or being a male or for his orientation or his religion or because he was in the wrong place at the wrong time or because he was a civilian and cops love just pickin' on civvies. He went looking for trouble and he found it. That doesn't make him a martyr; it makes him a moron.  How many innocent people on death row could benefit from his fervor? The prison system needs massive reformation. What's he done about that? If he was wrongfully detained, I anticipate reading in the Austin-American Statesman about his forthcoming lawsuit. That's what he needs to do, right? If cops are really getting away scot-free on things like this, it's because of a more pervasive, more institutionalized problem in the larger criminal justice system. If he were really concerned about this issue, that would be where he'd focus his efforts."

I agree that the guy acted ""oddly"", ""weirdly"", ""strangely,"" and even ""unusually.""  And by that definition, we can throw in that he acted ""suspiciously."" But this is all just layman's understanding of the term.  None of that amounts to rising to the legal definition ""reasonable suspicion"" that permits a detention.  I've read every comment in this thread.  But I don't see anyone able to articulate a specific criminal act that we reasonably suspect he was poised to commit."
amibeingdetained,3c551k,not-personal,1 point,Sat Jul 4 23:48:43 2015 UTC,"I read it more as a combination of factors, which is how I expect officers judge most events.   Was he recording video? Yes. If he was at a Walmart, recording people coming and going, and maybe zooming inside the store every now and then, it would be weird without being particularly suspicious.  Similarly, there's nothing particularly egregious or wrong with the occasional act of loitering. People loiter inside/outside restaurants. People loiter at/near bus stops without ever having any intention of riding a given bus. People loiter at gas stations. Again, perhaps a little weird, but not overly suspicious.  People stand outside police stations. Maybe they were there filing a report and are now waiting for their ride to come pick them up. Maybe they have to go in and make a statement and are reluctant to do so. Maybe an officer asked them to be there at a certain time, not realizing they're going to be arrested when they walk in the door. There are many legitimate reasons for someone being outside of a police station, none of which are weird or suspicious.  That being said, we have to take things in context. We have to take a number of seemingly disparate elements, discern a pattern, and infer an explanation (or a number of possible explanations.)  Loitering outside a police station.  Under a tree nowhere near the entrance.  For a while, it seems.  Filming.  Just filming.  All of those elements coming together raises eyebrows, as it should. Was there one specific action? No, but it's also not illegal for someone to loiter around a bike rack. It's not suspicious for them to somewhat discreetly look at all of the bikes, paying special attention to their locking mechanisms. It's not illegal to look a bit shifty, constantly glancing around more than the average person does.  That's still reasonable suspicion enough to stop and question the person. ""Mind if I check your backpack, sir? Oh, wow. Nothing in there but bolt cutters. ID, please."" Arrested for Class A theft for a bicycle before, it seems. ""Hands behind your back, please.""  Sometimes those suspicions turn out to be nothing. They don't get much press, though there was one floating around today of someone who was stopped on suspicion of carrying an automatic gun because it looked exactly like an MP5. Officer checked it. Placated the guy, who was very obviously only looking to rile people up. And then they were on their way. No false arrest. No illegal search and seizure.  There was another one floating around on this subreddit a few hours ago, I believe, of someone filming a military post/base of some sort. Pretty similar conditions, from what I understand, though I haven't watched the video. Same premise, though, isn't it? Domestic acts of terror are real. Don't forget that the worst instance of domestic terrorism to-date was carried out by a white, American Constitution-loving gun-fanatic. There's a lot of (unnecessary) anti-establishment anti-LEO sentiment being fomented lately. Eventually there are people who decide to do something about that.  Having rights doesn't mean there aren't consequences. Yes, people have the right to say what they think. We also have the right to ridicule them or (if they work in the private sector) fire them. You have the right to Google how to make a bomb. No one's saying you can't, but as a legal consequence, the government's ears will perk up. Yes, you have the right to be a creep-o outside a police station and film shift change for no discernible reason. Consequence: they'll try and figure out why."

It's good because you've demonstrated actual reasonable suspicion.  The bike theft guy reasonably appears to casing bikes and is suspected of planning to commit a theft of a bicycle.  That's articulating a suspicion to commit a specific criminal act:  bike theft.  But your example illustrates exactly my point about this video, which is why it's a terrible example for your case and undermines your argument.  Nobody here, you included, seems to able to articulate the exact crime this guy is suspected of being ready to commit.  And that is the legal standard for an investigative detention.  The video guy is just taking a video.  In a public place of police activity.  We know this is a protected activity.  So what is the crime?  Now, having said all this, I am going to attempt to answer my own question.  And maybe we should bring this conversation to an LEO or legal forum and see if we can get some feedback.   Because I am an LEO supporter, I wondered, ""maybe there is a crime that we can conclude they are investigating?""  This leads me to 18 USC (2331-2339) chapter 113B.  These are the ""terrorism"" criminal codes.  I think, that it would not be unreasonable for LEO to tell the defendant or a judge or jury, ""based on your behavior, and based on our LEO experience, and based on the history of the public's behavior in this location, it appears you are conducting a surveillance of this area for the purpose of finding security weakness in this public building.  We suspect that you may be planning, attempting or conspiring to commit an act in violation of 18 USC Chapter 113B, Acts of Terrorism against places of public use, government facilities or infrastructure.   We are investigating and you are being lawfully detained while we investigate.""  CASE CLOSED MOTHERFUCKER    You see, now we have a reasonable suspicion of a crime.  The guy seems to be surveying a police station in a suspicious manner that suggests he may reasonably be planning a terrorist action.     I think judges would eat that shit up and that's the end of the ""You Tube First Amendment Audit"".    Edit: formatting & spelling"
amibeingdetained,3c551k,megabits,1 point,Sun Jul 5 00:22:52 2015 UTC,"""based on your behavior, and based on our LEO experience, and based on the history of the public's behavior in this location, it appears you are conducting a surveillance of this area for the purpose of finding security weakness in this public building.   You're still making the could be argument. This guy could be doing any number of things for any number of reasons.  What specifically about his behaviour leads you to think this guy is a terrorist. Is his behaviour typical of terrorists. What terrorists have been known to do this? Is recording the activities of public employees something that terrorists do?  What specifically about your LEO experience leads you to think this guy is a terrorist. Do you have training on identifying terrorists? Have you identified terrorists in the past? How many terrorists have you arrested?  What specifically about the public's behavior in this location leads you to think this guy is a terrorist. Are terrorists known to frequent this location? Have there been a number of terrorist attacks in this location? Have there been threats of terrorist attacks on this location?  Let's look at the definitions in §2331 of the code you cited...  ""international terrorism"", ""national of the United States"", and ""act of war"" don't apply here. That leaves ""person"", which certainly applies and ""domestic terrorism"". Let's take a look at that one:   (5) the term “domestic terrorism” means activities that—   (A) involve acts dangerous to human life that are a violation of the criminal laws of the United States or of any State;  (B) appear to be intended—   (i) to intimidate or coerce a civilian population; (ii) to influence the policy of a government by intimidation or coercion; or (iii) to affect the conduct of a government by mass destruction, assassination, or kidnapping; and   (C) occur primarily within the territorial jurisdiction of the United States.    His activities don't appear to be dangerous to human life or in violation of any criminal laws. His intent does not appear to be to intimidate or coerce the civilian population, to influence government policy by intimidation, or to affect the conduct of a government by mass destruction, assassination, or kidnapping.  He appears to be watching police. His reasons for this are ambiguous at best. Is he a student working on a project? Is he someone interested in law enforcement? Is he plotting to kill the police? We don't know and there's nothing here that suggests he is likely to be doing any of these things, just that he could be doing one of them. His intent is unclear.  That being said, he could be doing any of these things which is what makes him suspicious and gives police a reason to approach him, but there are no articulable facts here that would lead a reasonable person to think that this guy is a domestic terrorist intent on doing any of the things define above. Behaving suspiciously is cause for investigation, but being suspicious alone does not constitute the legal definition of reasonable suspicion. You need more than could be or a hunch.  Not only was there no reasonable suspicion for detention there was no separate reasonable suspicion that he was both armed and dangerous, making not just the detention, but even the frisk illegal.  Going further, if we were to consider the act of observing and recording public officials doing the public's work in a public place as reasonable suspicion for detention, it would have a very chilling effect on government transparency and accountability as well as foundational civil liberties. It would also be contrary to the SCOTUS ruling in Glik v. Cunniffe from the 1st Circuit.  I get that you don't like some guy fucking with police, but your stance has clouded your thinking. Even the cops that confronted the guy on the scene know he's trolling cops for YouTube videos. They even poke fun at him for it, talking about his ""YouTube education"" and acknowledging that the situation ""makes great fodder"" for YouTube.   CASE CLOSED MOTHERFUCKER   Not so much."
amibeingdetained,3c551k,Myrmec,0,Sun Jul 5 06:13:08 2015 UTC,"You're equating being suspicious with reasonable suspicion. It doesn't work that way.  Reasonable suspicion must be based on ""specific and articulable facts"", ""taken together with rational inferences from those facts"", and the suspicion must be associated with the specific individual in question.  You've made some rational inferences, but have no specific facts and none of it is specific to the individual. You've even suggested as much yourself:   Was there one specific action? No   With these things fresh in mind, try again. What specifically was the crime that was committed, was being committed, or was about to be committed? What specific facts lead you to believe that this specific person committed that crime.  That's what you need to detain someone. Without at least that much it is a consensual encounter and the person must be free to go."

amibeingdetained,3buniv,theansweris_fortytwo,3,Thu Jul 2 14:41:01 2015 UTC,Unnecessarily put his hands on him? You have to put hands on someone to arrest them.
amibeingdetained,3buniv,ThroughThePlanets,1 point,Thu Jul 2 15:11:38 2015 UTC,"Just rewatched it to check this.  The guy in red is told he's under arrest and tells them no (you can't do that). Then he tries to walk away. The cop is plain clothes and appears to only have a gun, instead of pulling it out he tries to keep the (large) man from leaving by pushing him back. This escalates.  His three options are to do what he's doing, drawn his firearm (which he shouldn't as there's no deadly threat) or to let him go. He can't let him go, simply walking away from police when told ""you're under arrest"" is not something they can allow.  At some point the cop pushes him into the fence, he's TRYING to keep the guy in place until backup arrives and the guy can be safely arrested  The guy then screams ""don't punch me"" however the worlds worst cameraman decides that the 5-6 seconds before that should be spent filming the sidewalk. There is no evidence the cop hit him first and it's likely one of his attempts to push the guy back to where he wants him resulted in his hand hitting his face.  So the first punch thrown on camera is clearly done so by the guy in red. He lands a solid jab to the cops face at 1.34. Now I'll admit that after that the cop seemed to ""see red"" a bit and moved from trying to keep the guy in place to punching him back. It's hard to critisise too much, being smacked in the face has that effect on people, thought I again point out that he doesn't drawn his firearm despite the fact he's now actually under attack. He continues to keep the guy at bay while waiting for backup.  So before you say this...   I guess if this sub is all about circlejerking then it doesn't really matter what was actually in the video.   Maybe make sure what you're saying is in the video. Because what you claim (that the cop threw the first punch) is not there. What is there is a guy was told he was under arrest and refused, then attacked a police officer.  There may be more to it, because the video starts at the resisting and misses the timeframe where the cop would have thrown the first punch (if he did so, like I said, it's far more likely one of his attempts to push the guy back glances up and into his face). But everything in that video supports the police, not the guy being arrested."

amibeingdetained,3buniv,TheDarkLordisAlive,-1,Thu Jul 2 09:21:43 2015 UTC,"Ok, so it's NYPD. Therefore in NY. Which mean we're in the land of the glorious DeBour Levels for Police Interactions (see also, the explanatory narrative about the levels).  Don't freak out. Just don't fucking freak out. You're giving police in NY a reason to bump the the goddamn level because they are trained in how to clearly articulate the reasoning and criteria needed to justify the rise the in DeBour levels. He started freaking out, giving the police an articulable reason to raise it to level 3, and brought out the handcuffs to do a frisk for weapons because HE WAS FREAKING OUT! I know it may be hard sometimes to not call bullshit on the NYPD (especially with me living in and born/raised in NY, the NYPD are the brunt of jokes of being the worst trained police in NY) but keep your cool and shit together, regardless."
amibeingdetained,3buniv,ViviMan65,2,Thu Jul 2 11:44:42 2015 UTC,Don't freak out. Just don't fucking freak out.   It seems that a good portion of the videos on YT the show arrests are from people who escalated the situation themselves by reacting poorly. Do they honestly think it will help them by freaking out?
amibeingdetained,3buniv,ThroughThePlanets,3,Thu Jul 2 13:20:43 2015 UTC,"Heh, it really doesn't. My friend/colleague in law school, who works part time as a cop, has specifically told me that if he sees that someone is acting strange or freaking out over a simple command, he will take advantage of that (and properly articulate that for the police report) and will end up frisking someone because:  1.) he doesn't want to get killed, and   2.) he always gives people a verbal ""take a moment to breathe and calm down"" before he goes into the routine police work, and if they're still twitchy and freaking out, he's bumping up the DeBour level.   Honestly, my crimpnal procedure professor always says, keep your shit together and always remind people to keep their shit together with police."
amibeingdetained,3buniv,overfloaterx,6,Sat Jul 18 12:05:56 2015 UTC,"Yep.. if you're confused you can simply ask ""am I free to go or am I being detained?"". It may seem cliche now (""AM I BEING DETAINED?!"") but honestly if you don't want to talk to the police you don't have to. Just ask them if you can leave, if they say you're being detained then ask them to inform you when that ceases to be the case.  If they say no then shut the fuck up. Perform any and all actions they ask you to and sort out if it was justified with a lawyer. Don't argue with them, just chill out and do what you're told.. literally nothing you can say or do will help you, only hurt.  I got stopped while out for a run a few months back. Cop pulls over and gets out, starts asking me all kinds of random questions. After about 30 seconds I said;  ""Hey man, I'm happy to help you out but honestly I just want to get back to my run.. is there something you need or am I free to go?""  He apologised and said someone matching my description had been involved in an assault a few streets away and he was stopping me to see how I'd react, but yes I was free to go. All perfectly civilized, no yelling and screaming about rights.  Was it a mild annoyance to my day? Sure. Do I care? Nope! Losing 2 minutes from my day so the cops can try find someone who's going around punching people is fine by me."
amibeingdetained,3buniv,biohazardforlunch,1 point,Thu Jul 2 14:23:55 2015 UTC,"Guy definitely shouldn't have resisted like that and swatted the cops arms away.   However the cop appears to be the first to throw an actual punch aimed to injure or debilitate, which was entirely unnecessary, going straight for the face. Also pretty clear he was itching for a fight and wasn't interested in deescalating.  The cops already had backup less than 90 seconds away. The guy was walking away, did not pose any threat to the public, and was not instigating contact or aggression toward the cops. They could have followed along with the guy until sufficient backup appeared for an overwhelming display of force so the guy knew he was cornered, and subdued him without throwing any punches.  The guy was stupid to offer any physical reaction, yes, but the cop was unnecessarily antagonistic. This kind of conduct and physicality from a cop would be absolutely, 100% shockingly unacceptable in many countries. Anyone defending it without question needs to seriously consider the standards to which they hold US LEOs.   I'm seeing an increasing number of posts in this sub devolve into ""cops can do no wrong"" circlejerk just because the subject did something stupid. These situations aren't either/or scenarios where only one party is capable of guilt or irresponsible action."

amibeingdetained,3buniv,tomokapaws,2,Thu Jul 2 21:39:14 2015 UTC,I thought stop and frisk was ruled unconstitutional. How can it be a lawful stop for nothing
amibeingdetained,3buniv,MundiMori,7,Fri Jul 3 11:34:33 2015 UTC,"Not in the slightest. In fact, stop and frisk is another name for a Terry Stop, as defined by Terry v. Ohio, a supreme court case that said police can stop individuals based on reasonable suspicion. If they also have reasonable suspicion that they individual is armed, they may frisk them.   What was ruled unconstitutional was NYPD's application of the law in a manner that unreasonably targeted minority communities. That is a matter of policy, not law."

That cop showed some balls going fisticuffs with a guy who had a lot of reach and at least 50 lbs on him."
amibeingdetained,3buniv,dvaunr,4,Thu Jul 2 20:12:51 2015 UTC,"He apparently had a pen knife on his possession (5:58).  Think the original problem rose when the suspect in this one refused to comply on the grounds that they had no reasonable suspicion to believe he had a knife on him (They were yelling something about the officers not having seen the knife at all).  At 1:34 the suspect's fist appears to connect with the officer, however it looks as though he only intended to push the officer away - the officer immediately strikes back after that.  Can't really hear a word the officer says during the video, so no idea if someone called in that he had a knife or if they had previous knowledge of him carrying weapons in the area (or if no reason for suspicion was given).  I think the only thing we can say for sure is that he has everything on camera, man."

But you may not have the right to stop them from searching you given the circumstances. Example, you can refuse a search during a Terry stop. You cannot when you're being arrested.   Four. You probably won't see your lawyer until arraignment, but you definitely won't be able to talk to them before you get booked (wherein you will be asked a series of questions that you must answer even if you wish to exercise your fifth amendment right to remain silent). If you want to talk to a lawyer prior to arraignment, that one will not be court appointed and has to come out of your pocket. Additionally, they do not need to tell you why you have been arrested until the arraignment.  Six. Depends on department policy, but they really only have to provide proof that they are actually a police officer. They don't need to identify themselves further (unless, again, their specific department has a policy regarding that).  Seven. Police Officers are allowed to swear at people for a variety of reasons. There are limits to this, but you can't report them for just saying bad words (Well, you can, but the complaint will be thrown out).  Edit: Reddit doesn't like lists I guess. So I had to do this."
amibeingdetained,3bntqn,DegenerateMutt,21,Tue Jun 30 18:59:32 2015 UTC,From what I understand (which isn't much) it is correct but it definitely needs a user guide! Every point on this card needs to have a LARGE asterisk.

amibeingdetained,3bntqn,doggy_styles,6,Wed Jul 1 00:00:22 2015 UTC,It's not correct on some of them.  Just flat wrong.  An arresting / detaining officer does not have to tell you why you are being arrested or detained.  Period.

It also misconstrues Sixth Amendment rights to counsel for indigent defendants (right to counsel doesn't attach until after formal charges are brought so - as was said before - any lawyer pre-arraignment is out of your own pocket.)

amibeingdetained,3bntqn,onemessageyo,2,Wed Jul 1 12:54:37 2015 UTC,"Always tell them you do not consent. Especially if you are in handcuffs. They will likely still search, but it may be enough.  When I was 18, I was pulled over in a full felony stop, guns drawn hands out the window, backing up to the police and facedown in the street while cuffs are put on. My passenger and I were asked if we could be searched and my car searched. I was the driver. My passenger told them "" do what you want, it's not my car"". I told them simply no, I do not give them permission to search me or my car. They told me they didnt need my permission and searched anyways. They found a Pellet Gun on the floorboard of the back seat. We were arrested and charged with all kinds of crazy felonies. Being involved in a drive by ahooting, knowingly allowing a passenger to discharge a firearm from my vehicle, carrying a concealed firearm, etc.   When everything against me was dropped, my public defender basically told me it was because I did not consent to the search and there was a question as to whether it was legal. The DA didn't want to fight it. I have no doubt it was a legal search, but this muddied the waters enough 25 years ago to make it not worth it for the DA . Even if the search was legal, the fight may be more than the DA wants to deal with."

Just found out about this sub, seems great to make fun of these ''I know my rights'' types, but there are also incidents where cops are unnecessarily rude and I don't think they should be celebrated either.  This cop seemed to come out agressive right from the start, raising his voice, commanding that lady to take her hands out of her pockets, and then that line which definitely came across as a threat. Not saying the sovereign was being anything but stupid, but this cop seems like an asshole as well."
amibeingdetained,3bi3fo,YetAnother_WhiteGuy,32,Tue Jun 30 17:31:19 2015 UTC,- Good day  - Good day how are you?  - Great. License and registration please  - Well now. You see. There is no driver here. This isn't a vehicle. We're actually travelling you see. So we have no reason to give you anything whatsoever and you can just fuck o-  - Shut up. Gimme license and registration now.  I'd say that the cop was in the right tbh. Maybe he wasn't sucking on the sovereign dude's pecker and all but everyone who opens a conversation with such an overwhelmingly moronic statement has it coming to them
amibeingdetained,3bi3fo,sapunec7854,-24,Tue Jun 30 18:03:46 2015 UTC,"Uhm....that's not what he said, at all, and I'm sure you know that. I could just as easily spell the conversation out so the cop started like ''good day peasant scum, I am here to dominate and abuse you'' but I'd rather focus on what actually occurred if we're going to be talking about this at all, agreed?  Anyway I already said the sovereign was being stupid but 1, he's only one dude in the car, the cop was immediately hostile to all of them and 2, he's just a guy, if he's a moron it's inconsequential, I like to hold law enforcement officers to a bit of a higher standard then that. When I worked in a bar I sometimes had to kick people out, I wasn't a bouncer so people were almost always rude about it, but I kept my cool no matter how rude or moronic they got, because I was the one there in a professional capacity. A cop should be able to do the same."
amibeingdetained,3bi3fo,YetAnother_WhiteGuy,11,Tue Jun 30 18:31:20 2015 UTC,"Uhm....that's not what he said, at all,   Just rewatched it. It's pretty much how it went down man... Are you sure we're even talking about the right video?"
amibeingdetained,3bi3fo,sapunec7854,-8,Tue Jun 30 20:58:27 2015 UTC,"He said ''there's no driver'' which is super weird and also the only thing that kind of fits with what you said, he never came close to telling the cop to go fuck himself, he stuttered out his little freefolk speech respectfully, if a little hastily. He never sounded rude just...dumb.   That's when the cop was there of course, when he left the dude went full on crazy with his ramblings, but I'd wager a guess that's because nothing triggers a sovereign like encountering a cop that actually is a little bit unnecessarily rude and dominating."
amibeingdetained,3bi3fo,YetAnother_WhiteGuy,5,Wed Jul 1 03:06:41 2015 UTC,"Oh my god dude are you twelve? Of course that condensing 4-5 sentences worth of conversation into less than a paragraph will result in inconsistencies!  As for your actual idea - that saying what he said (and don't even get me started on the tone that idiot was using) was merely dumb it's just not true! He's like the idiot who argues with a manager over $0.25, he's like the moron who you paid to fix something in your house but fucked up bad and demanded to be paid in full regardless, he's such a typical condescending yet utterly clueless lummox who's really old enough to know better that I felt frustrated listening to his voice alone before the cop told him to STFU  I'm done with this conversation. I know that sometimes people who get downvoted in a sub are in the right and are just disagreeing with the hive mind but you, dude, are just ultra, mega, super-duper wrong."
amibeingdetained,3bi3fo,sapunec7854,-7,Wed Jul 1 08:14:59 2015 UTC,"It's not just condensing. You basically assumed he was telling the cop to go fuck himself in different words but there was nothing close to that in what he said, obviously if you assume that's what he meant then the cop was completely in the right, but if you look at the situation realistically the story changes a bit. Seems like you started watching the video with the assumption that the cop did everything right and bent what happened to fit that narrative.  I used to work in retail, that guy you mentioned that argues over 25 cents? Yeah when I called my manager over and was trying to explain to him but the dude kept talking over me I was not allowed to point at him and go ''I'm not talking to you, don't open your mouth again''. That shit would get me fired, that's just not how you treat morons when you're on the clock. But yeah never mind me, go rejoin the hivemind."
amibeingdetained,3bi3fo,YetAnother_WhiteGuy,8,Wed Jul 1 12:15:50 2015 UTC,"I was not allowed to point at him and go ''I'm not talking to you, don't open your mouth again''.    Yeah bro but you know what - I don't think that why this convo was taking place you should've been doing something the purpose of which was specifically to protect the lives of others, literally. Cops who watch for drunk drivers better be doing their job right and often lest I end up with a two-dimensional relative or friend. You've seen these videos - those retards take 20-30 minutes worth of time for at least two cops and their supervisors. During this time any dangerous driver could've passed unimpeded and this is most certainly not OK. So, yeah, someone working at retail needs to be nice to clients even when they are cunts but people who are supposed to do things that save lives should be able to do this instead of wasting half an hour arguing with retards, who more often than not are doing something illegal and trying to hide it by acting like jackasses on purpose as was the case in the video  I'm done with this dude, I'm done"

amibeingdetained,3bi3fo,the_cornell,5,Tue Jun 30 18:59:54 2015 UTC,"A similar thing actually happened to me. I got a speeding ticket which I more or less forgot to pay. (I say more or less, because I did occasionally remember it, but always at times when I was away from home, and then promptly forgot again.)   So, one day I roll through a stop sign, and I get pulled over. I give the cop my license and insurance, and he comes back a few minutes later and says, ""hey the_cornell, did you know your license was revoked and you have a bench warrant out for our arrest?""   And I replied, honestly, ""no, I had no idea.""   And then I paused and I said, ""wait, I had a ticket I totally forgot to pay like a year ago, is that the issue?""   And the cop says, ""yep, that's it.""  So I apologized profusely for being so stupid, he writes me a ticket for driving on a suspended license, and he told me if I got pulled over again between then and when my court date was, that I just needed to show the officer the ticket and let him know I know about my court date.   That was it. And then he sent me on my way.   Maybe if I'd waxed philosophical about my sovereign rights, he would have arrested me! Dang! Well, there's always next time!"

He was pleasant to the cop and the cop wrote it up, then frowned and said he had to tow the car because his licence had been suspended.  This was the first my father had heard of this.  Apparebtly he had some other traffic violation from 9 months previous in the same town that he wasn't aware of. They hadn't notified him of it, but it was on record. The cop was very apologetic, but had to tow and impound the car. The impound yard would open on Tuesday.   My father spent a long weekend and most of the next week in a bureaucratic nightmare some town in NY that he'd passed through twice. In order to get the car back he had to speak to a judge and he still didn't leave there until Thursday. He was livid, and everyone he spoke to (cops, impound guy, judge, other judge, lawyers) agreed the situation was farcical but couldn't do anything about it.  A week after he got home he got a letter from a different judge with an apology, a refund of fees, and an explanation of how things were going to be changed so the same thing wouldn't happen again.

They're trying to get off on technicalities. It's like a murderer who walks free because an officer didn't recite the Miranda rights correctly, or made some other mistake. Now, the officer or detective or whoever should be held accountable, but it doesn't mean that the murderer didn't commit a crime. (And I'm talking about when we know the crime was committed -- like there is video evidence, or multiple witnesses, that type of thing. I'm not taking about police planting evidence or something like that.)  I'm a frequent speeder, I'll admit that. But if I get pulled over, guess what I do? I say, I'm sorry officer, and I accept and pay my ticket. That's what grown-ups do.   These guys want to use one very specific definition of traveling, completely ignoring the fact that on the back of their licenses, it stated clearly that they must provide proof that they can legally drive in whichever state they're driving in."

amibeingdetained,3bhd6n,goingthruit,3,Tue Jun 30 00:48:18 2015 UTC,"Arresting sovereigns is a huge pain in the ass. Prosecuting them is a bigger pain in the ass. Even if they don't physically fight you, they won't cooperate with any part of the arrest and identification process. They'll file retarded motions in court. They'll file liens against public officials including police. Just arresting this guy is gonna tie up police manpower for hours, probably the rest of the shift.  The warrant in question, if the guy is not from Nevada, is probably a no-extradition warrant, meaning that if they arrested him for it the other state that issued it won't come get him because it's too minor.  Most cops, especially in larger cities, do traffic stops to look for drugs and guns or other major crimes. Given that this guy's warrant is non-extraditable, and that the only laws they can tell he's breaking are traffic laws (minor misdemeanors), and the huge pain in the ass presented by arresting him, they let it go. They shouldn't have, in my opinion, but they did."

amibeingdetained,3bhd6n,MyTooSense,3,Tue Jun 30 17:26:08 2015 UTC,"It might not have been for a serious crime. There are some jurisdictions where if the warrant isn't for anything major, arresting the person is at the officer's discretion. They'll just inform you that you have a warrant, tell you that you should get it sorted out before it becomes more serious, and may note on the record that you have been informed. There are other jurisdictions where the officer is obligated to arrest a person with a warrant regardless of the severity.  For example, my cousin missed a court date for a minor possession citation and had a warrant issued on him for it. He got pulled over for speeding shortly after and the officer brought up the warrant. Because my cousin wasn't being a dick, the officer just told him to take care of it and sent him on his way."

amibeingdetained,3be622,well_thats_dope,22,Sun Jun 28 11:46:45 2015 UTC,"Newp. Texas lawyer here, the city should have paid her some amount in a settlement, despite what everyone here thinks, the officer was in the wrong and acting outside the law in Texas for two reasons:   She didn't violate the Texas Stop & Identify law. She refused, but it is only a violation if you refuse while under arrest. She was detained. It is only a violation if she had given a false name while detained. See Tex. Pen. Code Ann. § 38.02. You cannot be arrested for two things in TX and two things only while operating a motor vehicle; speeding and having an open container.   Since she couldn't be arrested for speeding, which was the offense he stopped her for, and refusal to ID while being detained is not against the law in Texas, the Officer has 0 law enforcement authority to arrest her here. His threat was illegal, and his arrest was illegal. Had she given a false name? He would have been in the right. But they don't get to arrest you for acting like a jerk.  EDIT: As the bobby below points out, she did violate a part of the transportation code, but I've never known an officer to arrest someone for that offense. I talked to a couple of colleagues and we came to the conclusion that the officer overreacted but was technically within his scope of authority. Most law enforcement jurisdictions have rules departmentally that they don't arrest for certain offenses. If the department typically doesn't arrest for that offense, and they do suddenly, it is going to be a hard civil case to fight which ultimately ends in a settlement in favor of the arrested Plaintiff. Apparently, nearly these same facts happened to a grandma in my county and she too was awarded a settlement by the city."

Ask her for her name and date of birth instead, insist that the sooner she provides the info, the sooner she can be on her way. If she continues to refuse, run the license plate and see if her info matches up to his system (photo, general age, sex, etc).   She could be legitimately subjected to a speeding fine and a Ch 521 transportation code fine not to exceed $200.   It was just handled very very badly. I've refused to show my DL in the past (because I left it at home accidentally) and was just asked politely for my name and DOB, which I never refuse to provide. Never had any problems.  In most situations like this, the suspect turned complainant against the city receives a settlement. Hot headed LEOs are problems for everyone."

Does Texas not have a similar offence?  EDIT:  Sec. 521.025 of the Transportation Code makes it an offence to fail to produce a driver's licence when required to do so by a peace officer.  Can she not be arrested for that?"
amibeingdetained,3be622,for_shaaame,3,Tue Jun 30 18:29:27 2015 UTC,"The difference being in the UK you can present it at a later date, right?"
amibeingdetained,3be622,WillOnlyGoUp,3,Tue Jun 30 23:42:37 2015 UTC,"Yes, the police can issue you with an HO/RT 1 form which requires you to present your documents within seven days to a police station of your choice. It is a defence to the crime to prove that you provided the documents to a police station within seven days in accordance with such a requirement.   However, if the officer has reason to doubt that you are who you say you are, you may find yourself being arrested. I don't expect people to carry their insurance certificate, MOT, or V5 certificate with them in the car; generally I will just check on the computer that the documents are in order, and only issue an HO/RT1 if there is a problem (e.g. The computer says the car has no MOT but the owner is adamant that it does).  If someone says they aren't carrying their driver's licence or any form of ID on them - not even a bank card in their name - it makes me suspicious immediately, and I will probably want to dig deeper before I issue an HO/RT to a false name and address."
amibeingdetained,3be622,for_shaaame,0,Wed Jul 1 20:35:02 2015 UTC,"IIRC, the transportation code makes your first failure to produce your driver's license on demand a Class C fine; but specifically excludes confinement as a punishment unless it is your 2nd offense.  The insurance question is a bit trickier, as the specific vehicle requires coverage, but the person operating doesn't necessarily have to be a driver on the insurance ID card (they could be borrowing the vehicle). You could be subjected to a fine for ""failure to maintain or carry proof of insurance"", but these get dismissed if you go to the court with proof of insurance.   The officer in this situation simply lost his patience far too soon."
amibeingdetained,3be622,gr33nm4n,2,Tue Jun 30 18:36:38 2015 UTC,"The officer in this situation simply lost his patience far too soon.   I am forced to agree with you there.   the transportation code makes your first failure to produce your driver's license on demand a Class C fine; but specifically excludes confinement as a punishment unless it is your 2nd offense.   I edited my last post to put the link to the Transportation Code in there - confinement is a punishment for a third offence within a certain amount of time.  ""As a punishment"" - but confinement post-arrest and pre-charge/sentencing is not a punishment... is it?  That might be different in Texas, but here in the UK only the courts have the power to make ""punishments"", and only after guilt is proven beyond reasonable doubt - and there is a clear distinction between detention after arrest and imprisonment after conviction.  Are the police in Texas able to hand out confinement as a punishment at the roadside?  I don't see how any criminal justice system could convincingly work if there were offences for which a person couldn't be arrested - if stopped for one of those offences you could simply refuse to provide your name forever (or until the officer's shift was over) and walk away scot free, because they can't arrest you for it and can't summon you to court and process you there without a name.  He arrested far quicker than I would have done, but (and I will defer to your experience here, obviously) I don't see yet what part of the arrest itself was unlawful?  EDIT:  I don't mean to question you when you've dedicated your career to understanding Texas law, I'm just interested in the differences between British and American criminal law.  We seem to put a lot more trust in the police to do the right thing here without protections like search warrants etc."
amibeingdetained,3be622,for_shaaame,2,Tue Jun 30 18:47:02 2015 UTC,"No, actually, you raise really valid points and so I had to confer with some peers. You are absolutely correct; the confinement is the punishment, not the arrest. He was technically within the scope of his authority for the arrest, but we think the issue in this case is that the officer's department probably didn't have a standard procedure in place to arrest people on this violation. Nearly all law enforcement departments in Texas have a unspoken rule that they don't usually arrest for Class C offenses.  The fact he overrracted and that the department probably doesn't usually arrest for this offense is what likely resulted in the settlement.   We started talking about the scenario where this happens and the officer, for whatever reason, doesn't use the system in his car to look up the vehicles info; what happens in a stand off between a driver failing to comply w/ 521 if the city wanted to avoid a lawsuit. No one really has an answer."

And I only used body language as a general term. She was clearly not looking for her ID, just sitting there staring at the officer and defying his request which he was in the right to give.  And, of course, the final straw is that he told her he would have to arrest her if she kept being non-compliant, and then she told him to go ahead, which de facto meant she admitted to resisting to the point of needing arrest. Whether or not that's what she meant, that evidence will hold up in a court."
amibeingdetained,3be622,chevybow,-2,Sun Jun 28 22:44:48 2015 UTC,"I didn't care at all, to be honest. She should do it anyway. And no, the fact that he said he would have to arrest her, doesn't make it justified, because if you think straight, he didn't ahve to arrest her. It was completely unnecessary. If you can't deal with that kind of people and be just a LITTLE patient, then you should not be a cop. A troglodyte with a gun is never a good idea, unless I get mine too. Justifying his behaviour because of hers is almost the same as trying to justify a crime with another one. The best example I've seen in this sub is the one where a guy was shot dead. The cop did everything right, extremely patient. Unfortunately the guy was a dickhead and ended up getting himself shot."

But it was clear she wasn't planning on complying and I can't think of a better way for him to arrest her, she didn't want to leave the car then he has to pull her out, he used just enough force to do that (note, at first he was only holding her arm, and waited to apply more force until she continued to resist). It isn't going to be comfortable but it's the only option that doesn't involve yelling at an old lady for half an hour or escalating beyond pulling.  The other objectable spot would be how quick he went from talking to arresting her, but after her refusing to give her license several times he said ""Give it to me now or you're going to jail"", to which she said ""Go ahead"". He decided not to continue to argue and to do just that, and I think that was reasonable. It's a situation that would be nice to avoid, she put herself into it.  TL;DR: Eh. ¯\(ツ)/¯"

You are required to have a driver's license to drive a car so LOE's are allowed to verify that you do in fact have a driver's license when they pull you over.

However a lot of people seem to take it a bit far, and start to believe that they should have the freedom to do whatever they want, whenever they want. It's an oversimplified understanding of the concept of freedom. They start to believe that whenever an authority figure restricts their freedom (in this case, his freedom to stand up), it's a violation of their constitutional rights.  Essentially it's a poor grasp of how the legal system works, a poor grasp of how society works, and a poor grasp of the US constitution. Damn entertaining though."

I'm aware that it's their courtroom and you have to obey their rules and this guy may have been an ass before but it seemed like the judge got pissed with the guy and sent him to jail over something trivial.  In my opinion the judge shouldn't have done something as serious as having the man arrested for not sitting down which he appeared to be doing so before the judge called on him and had already done before  the judge had him arrested him.

Then when you finally think they're listening they just have to push that little bit more? They know you're angry and you told them to put away their toys... but instead they just pushed it behind the couch and pretended they didn't hear you?  That is what happened in there. That guy had been fighting the judge on every little point from the very start. Refusing to comply, refusing to confirm his name, refusing to simply follow the legal proceedings properly as though he had a choice in the matter... the legal system doesn't work so well if people can just opt out.   There are a dozen employees in that room. Every second he fucks about is costing taxpayers money and delaying the proceedings for other people who are waiting on the judge.   Not only that, the judge knows this guy is doing it on purpose. He's a self proclaimed ""freeman of the land"" and is doing everything he can to say that he isn't a part of the system and that the court holds no authority over him, or trying to 'outsmart' the judge on legal technicalities. Notice the lack of a lawyer? It's because actual lawyers know the law and are of no use to these guys.  I've been in a court room and seen some real etiquette fuck ups from people simply because they don't know what they're supposed to do/are nervous/whatever.

amibeingdetained,3b4isu,ghosttrainhobo,4,Fri Jun 26 03:36:07 2015 UTC,"Obstructing Justice. I got the same charge once. Cops called a K9 to sniff my car, and when the K9 came, they told me to leave. I had my windows open and all my stuff in my car so I told them I was going to watch. They told me to go away, I took a few steps back and said I wanted to watch; it was my car and my stuff and I wanted to see what would happen. They arrested me for obstruction of justice by means of intimidation specifically by refusing to leave the scene of a criminal investigation (the cop said he smelled weed and didn't have PC to search the vehicle; I didn't want the cop to plant something or for the dog to fuck up my interior, etc). The charge didn't stick but it gave him a reason to arrest me and impound my car."
amibeingdetained,3b4isu,onemessageyo,6,Fri Jun 26 15:10:22 2015 UTC,Where did they expect you to go?  To just start walking down the shoulder of the road while they rifled through your car?

amibeingdetained,3b4isu,dieorlivetrying,-4,Fri Jun 26 03:37:03 2015 UTC,"It's my property. I wanted to know what was going to happen. That kind of stuff does happen. Half a gram of weed isn't shit, and it wasn't in plain sight so he needed a warrant to find it. He could have planted coke, he could have had the dog fuck my shit up, he could have opened the center console, pulled out the weed and wrote on the police report that it was sitting there on the seat in plain view. It's sketchy when a hyperactive dog shows up and the cop is already pissed at you for not consenting to a search and then he wants you to turn your back on your personal belongings and walk away while he does whatever the fuck he wants with no supervision. He was going to try to arrest me for having a crowbar in my car and charging it as a weapon. I don't give a fuck about a minor possession charge, and like I said, it got dropped in court because it was bullshit, and the prosecutor could tell from the police report. Getting arrested for obstruction of justice just made it easier to get the whole thing dropped because it showed the officer's frustration and determination to inconvenience me.  The dog didn't find shit, by the way."
amibeingdetained,3b4isu,baseddogpatrick,11,Fri Jun 26 11:32:11 2015 UTC,"So in the end you indeed left the scene, the cop did NOT plant anything and you got charged for obstruction of justice for no reason at all.  Smart plan."
amibeingdetained,3b4isu,freelandford,-5,Fri Jun 26 11:50:33 2015 UTC,"No. I witnessed the dog walk from the back seat of a police car and watched the dog find nothing and the dog handler dodnt get a hit. In the end I was convicted of nothing. My adherence to protecting my rights and property paid off. Even though they found weed in the end, they were not able to convict me for it."
amibeingdetained,3b4isu,businessmansa,6,Fri Jun 26 12:39:50 2015 UTC,"So what would you have done if you caught them planting more drugs in your car? Would you have said, ""Ah-HA!"", and then taken it to court?  Because literally nothing in that scenario separates you from someone who would just lie in court. All you have to go by is your word. And if they found a brick of heroin in your car while you were a mile down the road with a blindfold on...you'd know they planted it. And still have no proof.  You were powerless either way; should have just been compliant--as that was the one thing you had control over at that moment. And you controlled it off a cliff."
amibeingdetained,3b4isu,Skridg,7,Fri Jun 26 12:09:08 2015 UTC,So you were afraid they'd plant drugs on you even though you already had drugs in there? That doesn't make much sense.

But I'm intrigued by this.  I wonder if there is legal precedent for the government revoking citizenship under certain circumstances.  I'm sure that most law enforcement officers from any branch have very little interest in these sovereign types save for being aware that a lot of them are violent nutcases.  The expense of deporting people is probably also a reason they wouldn't bother without tons of public pressure.

I got into it with some of these guys recently over at another subreddit (I think they might have read a crosspost, gotten angry and  us making fun of them and poked around people's thread history). Anywho. Their whole thing was that the government didn't owe them shit. That was a reoccurring theme. They want all of the benefits, but don't want to contribute towards any of the responsibilities (some of these guys argue they don't have to pay taxes under similarly nebulous grounds of 'individuals earn wages not income', they object viscerally to the draft that has been amended very specifically to facilitate and all volunteer army for the last fifteen years of war, and just generally being twats to cops).

Here's what would theoretically have to happen:   1-You perform one of the actions listed in your passport that could cause loss of US citizenship  2-the US government finds out about it. And cares enough to bring charges.  3-THe standard of evidence for losing your citizenship is basically that you had to perform one of those actions and know and intend to lose US citizenship by doing so. And it's the government's job to prove intent. There's almost no way to do that.   So essentially the law (the INA I think) says you can lose your citizenship, but in practice its pretty much impossible."

WHOS WRONG!? ENDED WITH AN ARREST..... ALL OVER A TRAFFIC INCIDENT WOW I WAS TRAVELING SOULFULLY WITH MY OWN KNOWLEDGE WITH INTENTIONS OF USE OF THE PUBLIC HIGHWAY'S WITH A VEHICLE THAT WAS BOUGHT ON 02/4/2013 FROM A PRIVATE PARTY FOR PRIVATE USE. TRAVELING SPEED TO MY KNOWLEDGE WAS APPROXIMATELY 65-75MPH DUE TO A KNOWN FACT OF MY AKNOWLEDGEMENT AND EXPERIENCE AS A PREVIOUS ""DRIVER"". I WAS VERY WELL IN CONTROL OF MY VEHICLE, WITH IT HAVING MECHANICAL/ TRANSMISSION ISSUES. ALSO I WOULD LIKE TO SAY I WOULD NOT EVER PUT MY FAMILY IN ANY SITUATION IN WHERE THEY MIGHT BE INTRODUCED TO BEING HARMED ON MY BEHALF. THE C.H.P OFFICER WAS OUT DOING HIS JURISDICTIONAL ENFORCEMENTS, FIRST & FOREMOST DURING THIS INCIDENT THAT OCCURRED THE TIME HE ""THOUGHT"" HE CLOCKED ME IN AT 80MPH/OR THE VEHICLE'S THAT I WAS SURROUNDED BY. DURING THAT TIME THERE WAS A GREAT CONFUSION OF WHO WAS THE ONE BEING ""PULLED OVER"". FIRST THERE WERE NO CORPUS DELICTI OR SIRENS/ALARMING THE EMERGENCY/OR CRIME THAT OCCURRED AS ONLY THE LIGHTS BEING VISIBLE AS HE CAME UPON MY VEHICLE THAT LED TO MY DETENTION. RIGHT OF WAY I FELT ACCUSED OF BEING SOME KIND OF THREAT OR CRIMINAL TO THE PUBLIC AS HE APPROCHED MY VEHICLE DEMANDING FOR WINDOWS TO BE ROLLED DOWN WITH HIS GUN HELD NEXT TO HIS WAIST. AS IF HE IS TO DO SO FOR HIS OWN SAFETY WHEN THERE IS NO THREAT SEEING MY 2YR OLD DAUGHTER IN THE BACKSEAT. HE APPROCHED MY GIRLFRIENDS/ PASSENGER WINDOW, HE RIGHT OF WAY DEMANDED FOR IDENTIFICATION. I FIGURED HE SAID THAT AS IT BEING A BUSY HIGHWAY. MY REPLY WAS ""I HAVE THE RIGHT TO REMAIN SILENT"" AND HANDED HIM MY SECURED PARTY AND NOTICE OF TRUTH. WHICH I SUBMITTED A COPY FOR PUBLIC CA RECORDS, I REFUSED TO ANSWER ANY OF HIS QUESTIONS DURING THAT TIME. HE KEPT FORCEFULLY DEMANDING FOR HARD COPY IDENTIFICATION/DL WHEN I WOULD REPLY "" IM NOT DRIVING TODAY, IM TRAVELING WITH MY FAMILY, SIR"". THAT BEING SAID TO THE OFFICER THEN AND THERE HE SHOULD HAVE AKNOWLEDGED WHAT HE HAD IN HIS HANDS. SO I PRAYED HE WOULD HAVE, BUT HE DID NOT. SO THEN I REQUESTED TO SPEAK TO  HIS SUPERVISOR WHICH HE WALKED BACK TO HIS CAR TO DO SO LIKE HE SAID HE WOULD. LEADING TO THE OFFICER TO MAKE FUN OR JOKE ABOUT MY AFFIDAVIT, TO HIS RIDE-ALONG HE HAD THAT DAY. AS MORE OFFICERS APPROCHED MY VEHICLE ALSO DEMANDING ME TO GET OUT OF MY VEHICLE WHILE THERE WAS ALL THAT TRAFFIC GOING ON. I FELT MY SAFETY WAS BEING IN MY VEHICLE WITH MY FAMILY, SO I CONTINUED TO IGNORE THEIR ""DEMANDS"". THEY CONTINUED TO THREATEN TO BREAK MY WINDOWS AND PULL ME OUT. SO I ENDED UP GIVING UP UNDER DURESS THAT DRIVERS LICENSE THAT I DO NOT CONSENT TO OR HAVE THE NEED FOR IT IF IM NOT OR EVER USED IT IN COMMERCE. SO THEN I DECIDED TO GET OUT OF MY VEHICLE FEARING FOR MY FAMILIES LIFE AND MINE. SAME TIME ALL THIS IS GOING ON IM RECORDING VIDEO/VISUAL AS THEY ARE WELL AWARE. I KEPT ASKING THE OFFICER ""WHAT EXACTLY DID I DO WRONG?"" I FELT LIKE THEY WANTED TO BE IN CHARGE OF THAT SITUATION AS THEY FELT THEY HAD GREATER POWER OR AUTHORITY OVER ME AS WE THE PEOPLE ARE ALL EQUAL. SO HE DECIDED TO STOP/PUT AN END TO IT BY TELLING ME TO JUST TURN AROUND AND PUT YOUR HANDS BEHIND YOUR BACK AS HE REFUSED TO ANSWER ""MY QUESTIONS"". THEN HE SLAMED ME ON THE BACK OF HIS VEHICLE'S TRUNK AND BY THE OTHER OFFICERS AS WELL HURTING MY BACK IM CURRENTLY ON DISABILITY, SAYING THAT I NEED TO STOP RESISTING ARREST WHEN IN FACT I WAS NOT AS ALSO SEEN ON MY FOOTAGE. SO THAT BEING DONE I WAS DEBRIVED OF MY FREEDOM TO MOVEMENT(TRAVEL) AND KIDNAPPED/ DISPOSITION OF SEIZED PERSONAL PROPERTY AS WELL.     Holy shit."

While I'm definitely not the biggest gun advocate, I could understand, and maybe even appreciate, concealed carry. You are armed to protect yourself. Can you tell me why there is such a thing as open carry? Why do they need their gun to be visible? Is it an intimidation move? Thinking they won't get mugged or hassled if they have a pistol strapped outside their coat?"
amibeingdetained,3b06f8,CanadianGuy116,2,Thu Jun 25 12:31:12 2015 UTC,"I think that some states require a permit for conceal carry, and no permit for open carry. So you can carry a firearm on your person as long as it is visible to people and police officers. This way concerned citizens can call the police and the police can check on the carrier and make sure everything is okay. I think that the reasoning behind this would be that hiding your gun can be viewed as more dishonest and possibly dangerous than displaying it, or that the person might be hiding it in order to commit a criminal act and have the element of surprise on their side.   Yes, I'm sure many people do it as an intimidation move. If some mugger is picking his targets he's probably going to pick the guy without the gun on his hip over the guy with the gun on his hip.   However other people don't like to open carry because they think it invites or incites danger."

When a citizen starts getting really angry at police and it's escalating maybe, just maybe the police should be taught to think ""wait a second, does he/she have a point?"" first.

The Constitution was flawed. It used to legalize slavery and count women and black people lower than white men. We all agree that is wrong, and it was fixed. The second amendment is no different. It was included as a military strategy so that militias (regular people self organizing into local armies) could form when needed. That need is gone as we have a professional military that we fund massively. Secondly, the second amendment is too general. It can remain but be modified to exclude guns altogether. The US can then become safer. Plenty of countries lack a second amendment and are safer than the US. UK cops usually don't carry guns, they don't need them! I don't want civilians with guns of any kind. The US gun culture is outdated and extremely dangerous. Historical analysis in the far future will make our current culture seem barbaric."

I mean, I obviously disagree, but I don't think your opinion is stupid or anything, we just have different ideologies.   However, and I am by no means a constitutional scholar, but I do think you are factually wrong about the intent of the second amendment. Militias were not a stand-in for military or law enforcement. One of the reasons for militias in the constitution is that if the government, for example, is taken over by a dictator or something, that civilians have the right to be armed in order to protect themselves. So, they can protect themselves from outside threats, or inside threats.   Now, I don't foresee every needing to do that. And I certainly hope that never happens. I'm not a far right wing nut job waiting in the wings to take down the government. And I highly doubt I would take part in it even if it were needed. But I would want to be able to protect myself or my family from either a hostile government OR a hostile militia. Either way, I believe it is our right to arm ourselves.   That said, I could be wrong about militias and the intent of the second amendment. But I don't believe I would group the right to bear arms with slavery or lack of suffrage. Owning guns does not infringe on anyone's rights like those two things did."
amibeingdetained,3b06f8,the_cornell,-1,Thu Jun 25 23:36:22 2015 UTC,"I am by no means a constitutional scholar, but I do think you are factually wrong about the intent of the second amendment. Militias were not a stand-in for military or law enforcement.   The Second Amendment consists of just one sentence: ""A well regulated militia, being necessary for the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed."" This sentence is often interpreted differently because of the unusual comma placement, but the way it is most commonly translated to other languages is: ""Because a well regulated militia is necessary for the security of a free state, the right of the people to bear arms shall not be infringed"".  On June 8, 1789, James Madison—an ardent Federalist who had won election to Congress only after agreeing to push for changes to the newly ratified Constitution—proposed 17 amendments on topics ranging from the size of congressional districts to legislative pay to the right to religious freedom. One addressed the “well regulated militia” and the right “to keep and bear arms.” We don’t really know what he meant by it. At the time, Americans expected to be able to own guns, a legacy of English common law and rights. But the overwhelming use of the phrase “bear arms” in those days referred to military activities.  There is not a single word about an individual’s right to a gun for self-defense or recreation in Madison’s notes from the Constitutional Convention. Nor was it mentioned, with a few scattered exceptions, in the records of the ratification debates in the states. Nor did the U.S. House of Representatives discuss the topic as it marked up the Bill of Rights. In fact, the original version passed by the House included a conscientious objector provision. “A well regulated militia,” it explained, “composed of the body of the people, being the best security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed, but no one religiously scrupulous of bearing arms, shall be compelled to render military service in person.”   One of the reasons for militias in the constitution is that if the government, for example, is taken over by a dictator or something, that civilians have the right to be armed in order to protect themselves. So, they can protect themselves from outside threats, or inside threats.    That is of course very different today, because the guns you're allowed to own legally won't help you against modern tanks and drones in case some dictator would really want to take over the government. And against outside threats, we have our professional military.  After the Civil War, there were a lot of freed slaves who were terrorized by white vigilantes. One of the purposes of some of the framers of the 14th Amendment was to make sure that they get guns. Now, the Reconstruction government that enforced the 14th Amendment also had very strong gun laws, such as prohibitions on carrying concealed weapons. Just like the colonial period and the early revolutionary period, it was a very different time. What you had in the South was low-grade guerrilla warfare between the races. In my opinion, it's hard to draw the lesson of what we should do now, in our urban society where assault weapons are available for sale, from the Reconstruction era.  By the way, I’m not suggesting that all guns be summarily abolished. Like any product that carries certain dangerous consequences, I’ll concede that guns should still be available for purchase but regulated accordingly, not unlike automobiles, tobacco or liquor. In terms of revising the amendment, I would suggest coupling the notion of constitutionally-protected firearm ownership with military service, assuring proper training and use of firearms. Plus, military service provides a specific and unquestionable need for firearms: combat in the name of national defense."
amibeingdetained,3b06f8,IAmNotARobotNorHuman,-1,Fri Jun 26 00:07:34 2015 UTC,"Well it'd be hard to conceal carry an AR15.   I think that it's a good idea to be allowed to open carry an AR15.

I wouldn't like to be stopped and arrested by police and have my gun confiscated in that situation. The right to bear arms becomes rather limited if it is restricted to my house and my property.   That being said, I think most of these guys are asshats. They seem to do it for attention and little else. I don't really see a need to walk around with an assault rifle on chest during my day-to-day encounters.

I wouldn't like to be stopped and arrested by police and have my gun confiscated in that situation. The right to bear arms becomes rather limited if it is restricted to my house and my property.    When the Second Amendment was written, there were plenty of guns. There was the right to defend yourself, which was part of English common law handed down from England. But there were also gun restrictions at the same time. There were many. There were limits, for example, on where you could store gunpowder. You couldn't have a loaded gun in your house in Boston. There were lots of limits on who could own guns for all different kinds of reasons. There was an expectation that you should be able to own a gun. But they didn't think they were writing that expectation into the Constitution with the Second Amendment.  Put another way: the Second Amendment is no longer a necessary means of self-preservation, as perhaps it might’ve been in a rural, agrarian, semi-hostile, slave-holding, post-colonial America. Absent the hazards of the late 18th Century, it’s strictly become a means of protecting the availability of a retail product. Hardware. A hobby. Guns are a product that we don’t absolutely have to own in order for democracy and liberty to flourish — and, in fact, owning a gun is statistically bad for you, that is unless you earn your living manufacturing and selling them."

You think guns are not a necessary means of self-preservation. I do.   You think that my owning guns is bad for me. I do not.   I think that guns in the hands of citizens are a deterrent against tyranny and a means of suppressing or overthrowing tyranny. I think the right to own guns for that purpose is necessary for a free society.
amibeingdetained,3b06f8,ProductofUnreality,2,Thu Jun 25 23:39:30 2015 UTC,"Absent hazards? Home invasions aren't a thing? Have people stopped murdering each other?    Look at England, Germany or Australia for example. These countries have banned guns, and the amount of gun violence and suicides from guns have gone down. Look at Israel, where they have strict gun laws. The Israeli soldiers are not allowed to take their arms home and the amount of military suicides from guns has gone down. We should make gun laws stricter. They are not a toy. They are really not even a tool. They are a killing device. As I said in another comment, ""I’m not suggesting that all guns be summarily abolished.

In terms of revising the amendment, I would suggest coupling the notion of constitutionally-protected firearm ownership with military service, assuring proper training and use of firearms.

Is the threat of tyranny foreign and domestic absolutely and certainly gone? Is there no longer a right for the people to defend the security of a free State?   If the government becomes tyrannical it is the people’s duty to take it back. This was a very relevant cause when America was trying to run from King George’s overpowering governance. The founding fathers wanted to ensure their government does not take the form of the one they just escaped from. Today, Americans do not need to fear the tyrannical rule of kings. In fact America has a government on the complete opposite side of the political spectrum. Besides, even if you were to attempt to take back the government, you would have no success. Your Smith & Wesson does not exactly help you when fighting drones or tanks. The founding fathers certainly did not anticipate the types of weaponry accessible today. The US also invests more in military than other countries, even compared to countries where guns are banned. I'd say every citizen carrying a gun is not necessary for the security against outside attacks.   Owning guns hasn't been bad for me or anyone I know. Maybe because the people I know and I are responsible with their guns and trained in gun safety and trained in how to use them.    I wasn't saying everyone who has a gun is unqualified to handle them. But the fact that everyone can get a gun without the proper training in gun safety that you and your friends had is concerning, which is why there should be restrictions like I mentioned above.   I think that guns in the hands of citizens are a deterrent against tyranny and a means of suppressing or overthrowing tyranny. I think the right to own guns for that purpose is necessary for a free society.    Sorry, but protecting the availability of firearms does nothing to foster a healthier democracy or perpetuate the existence of the United States. Nothing. The freedoms outlined in the Bill of Rights and the further amendments beyond it generally augment the sustainability of basic human rights and American democracy. Gun ownership, however, does not — at least in the modern context. Yes, we’re a nation founded upon liberty and freedom, but the freedom to buy a specific product, in this case, firearms, no longer has any bearing on those values (if it ever did in the first place). There aren’t amendments pertaining to the freedom to purchase any other product, yet our freedom to buy things is as healthy as ever. In fact, more than anything else we’ve become a consumer nation — and without any constitutional amendments protecting the right to consume. Oh, and by the way, isn’t it ironic that the same political faction that’s the most hell-bent on protecting gun ownership and, in their words, “liberty,” are the same people who are making it more difficult to cast a vote — heaping new layers of government regulations and restrictions upon our most vital human right.  What country fetishizes, idolizes, and sacralizes guns as much as does our United States? Possibly Mozambique — the only country with an AK47 on its flag, but really, it's long past time to end this obsessive ""My Precious"" attachment of Americans to instruments of death. There is no reason why people that went through no training in gun safety whatsoever should be able to own guns."

The socio-economic issues in the US and the size of the US is not comparable to those countries. Anyway a more revealing statistic would be the number of homicides and aggravated assaults of any manner before and after the ban of guns.    If the government becomes tyrannical it is the people’s duty to take it back.   Cool, so we agree there.    Besides, even if you were to attempt to take back the government, you would have no success   But we disagree there. It would incredibly difficult for a standard military power to root out an armed population from their home land. Combine that with the thought that American military personnel would likely not enjoy the idea of killing American citizens. Sure the death toll rises high for the ill equipped, but the cost rises and the will falls for the military power. The goal of war is not to cause more death, but to achieve objectives. Anyway, even I can't succeed it's within my rights to try.

I don't care. You have no idea how I vote or my stance on that issue, so that's irrelevant. For the record I think that it should be easier to vote and I think that voting should be encouraged.    it's long past time to end this obsessive ""My Precious"" attachment of Americans to instruments of death.   Teach your kids whatever you want about guns, and I'll teach mine what I want.   I don't think we need government regulated training in order to own guns, and I certainly don't think we should be required to serve in the military to own guns. What I would not mind, however, is registering guns in the same way we register cars, but without the fees. That way at least we'll know whose guns are illegally ending up in the wrong hands. I also think that firearm training and safety classes should be sought ought if one can afford them, if not at least you should find someone who can teach you that stuff before you purchase a gun. But I think that comes down to personal responsibility, not governmental responsibility."

The guy with the gun is asking for trouble carrying a rifle around like that, but he's not breaking the law. If the officer was concerned about whether he carried the proper licenses for the weapons he could have asked for them up front instead of trying to take the weapon by force. I honestly failed to see where he deserves to be arrested - sure he was verbally complaining every step of the way but he complied with their orders the whole time - how is he resisting arrest?

Or, do you mean that I should just be agreeing with your version of what the fifth amendment is?  In reality, you are referring to the Miranda Warning, which is not the same thing as fifth amendment rights. In fact, an officer can ask you all of the questions he wants without giving you a Miranda Warning. He just can't then use those answers as evidence against you in court. Big difference.   Yes, the border patrol also patrols the borders. Since the video disappeared, I assumed this was a more central checkpoint.   Wait, you didn't even WATCH the video, and yet you feel qualified to respond to my question about people IN the video?? I'm not even sure I have words for that...

And I say, show me some sort of proof that this is true. How can you possibly know that there are exactly zero reasons other than the one you gave? The audacity to think that you -- whatever your profession or area of expertise is -- know that out of a seemingly infinite number of possibilities, there is EXACTLY ONE, and you know what that EXACT ONE is is just amazing to me.

It's just hard to tell how much the other person knows about the topic sometimes.  As I said, the video was taken down before I could watch it, so I assumed it was one of the many ""random pointless checkpoint at which I refused to answer fishing questions.""   Be well! :-)"

The officer has no right to know where I have been, or where I am going, or why; So why tell them if they ask?  Same with searching my cars, homes, or any other property, why would I consent to a search?   As for the border, yes a nation has the right to protect it's boarder, but this is not at the boarder is it? This is a public highway; and is a clear violation of the 4th amendment."
