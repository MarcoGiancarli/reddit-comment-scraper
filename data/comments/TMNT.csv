TMNT,3e4zhb,CaraMcS,3,Wed Jul 22 00:18:39 2015 UTC,"The regular toy line is probably just a bit above his age.  But from the Half-Shell Heroes line there are a number of cool options.  (The links go to my reviews with photos and more info on each item.)  The Super Sewer HQ is pretty cool and a great choice if he already has some Half-Shell Hero figures.  Mega Mutant Leo is a nice stand alone figure and could be a nice transition into the larger, 11"" figures from the regular toy line.  But my first choice would probably be the Ninja Practice Pals.  They came out in the regular line a while ago, but they were rebranded as part of the Half-Shell Hero line when it started a year ago.  So they are safe for a younger child, but will still be something that they won't feel the need to ""outgrow"" since they are a preschool toy.  They are also fairly affordable at $20 each, so you could get just his favorite Turtle, or a couple of them.  The only downside is that they aren't stocked in every store anymore.  So you may have to look a little harder or order online."
TMNT,3e4zhb,tmntman,1 point,Wed Jul 22 01:43:46 2015 UTC,Wow. Great suggestions. I really like the all 3 options. I am going to take a look online at where I can get them. Thank you!
TMNT,3e4zhb,Superkaiju,1 point,Wed Jul 22 02:10:47 2015 UTC,"honestly i'd just say get him a bunch of the action figures. maybe keep a handle on the smaller bits so he wont lose them (container to hold them in and stuff). but for 100 bucks you can get all 4 turtles, splinters, shredder, april, casey, bebop and rocksteady, a foot solider, kirai. they cant be more than at most 10 bucks each."
TMNT,3e4zhb,ninjanomad196,1 point,Wed Jul 22 03:41:40 2015 UTC,"Heh, it's awsome that Ninja Turtles has lots of merchandise to pick from, but at the same time, it stinks that there is so much because it's also hard to pick from. I'd highly recommend Half-Shell Heroes, too. Save the action figures for a few years, because I have experience from my childhood that all the parts will get lost quickly, even if you try to keep an eye on them."

TMNT,3e3v19,Banagher-kun,2,Tue Jul 21 19:55:54 2015 UTC,ya i kinda am leaning towards buying the classics version. I heard  revoltech ones are super fragile even the real ones. I do like that i could also get rocksteady and bebop.
TMNT,3e3v19,MiCK_GaSM,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:16:27 2015 UTC,"Can't speak for their TMNT ones (I have the NECA turtles, which is about as good as you're going to get), but have several of their Transformers ones. The first run of Optimus and Megatron are the oldest in the bunch, and I've had no issues with fragility."

TMNT,3e3v19,twopinacoladas,2,Tue Jul 21 23:12:04 2015 UTC,"You can get much more dynamic poses with the revoltech Turtles, but they really aren't for playing with. Once you get a good pose, you might as well keep them that way for a while in a display, cuz you have to take your time posing them. If that sounds like a drawback, I didn't mean it that way. The revoltech Turtles are amazing and must haves, IMO.  The classics are worth getting, too! It's just they've been known to have a few qc problems. Either joints are too stiff, or too loose... or have poorly painted eyes (Donatello). So you need to be careful with buying those."
TMNT,3e3v19,Charlie8090,1 point,Wed Jul 22 06:07:23 2015 UTC,I haven't gotten the Revoltech ones but the classics are neat I particularly like the Classic 1990 movie figures better I think but both sets are good.  I'd say the 1990 ones are great with exception of Donatello's expression his head sculpt should have been done better I know what they were going for from the film but it doesn't work its to goofy and cartoony.  I have heard a lot of negative comments on the classics line and mostly the 1990 movie figures but honestly I like them they are also affordable where the Revoltech ones will cost $60 per figure unless you get the China bootlegs.
TMNT,3e3v19,tmntman,0,Wed Jul 22 04:20:20 2015 UTC,"I would go classic because you can get all 4 turtles, bebop, rocksteady, and they're working on krang & shredder. Plus there is the movie line that fits to scale with the classic line if you're interested."

If that makes sense.  • Descent: Journeys In The Dark - Created first edition, not sure what capacity he was involved for second edition. Basically a fantastic board game dungeon crawler.  • Fury of Dracula - One of those out of print games that people rave about. Think Letters From Whitechapel except Jack fights back when you find him. In fact, that's almost exactly what it is.  • A Game of Thrones - I just finished playing a game of the second edition about an hour ago. The perfect theme for the perfect backstabbing simulator.  • Sid Meier's Civilization: The Board Game - How do you create a board game based on a video game that was based on a board game? This is how.  So, basically, laid a lot of the groundwork for some of FFG's most successful franchises."
TMNT,3d04xa,NickGauss,3,Sun Jul 12 10:46:48 2015 UTC,Also for a bit of reference for anyone unfamiliar. An adventure card game is a relatively new concept. The most prevalent being the Pathfinder Adventure Card Game (https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/133038/pathfinder-adventure-card-game-rise-runelords-base).

TMNT,3csrdr,LordofMylar,2,Fri Jul 10 14:07:41 2015 UTC,"Value and worth are relative terms. If you love these statues, then yes, they're worth it. $129 for a statue is a very reasonable price."
TMNT,3csrdr,LordofMylar,3,Fri Jul 10 14:32:00 2015 UTC,Especially since I've seen every turtle statue that sells always shoots up in price once they are available and sell out!
TMNT,3csrdr,tmntman,2,Fri Jul 10 14:44:06 2015 UTC,"That's also true. If you're looking for an investment piece, good tmnt statues are almost always a safe bet."
TMNT,3csrdr,LordofMylar,2,Fri Jul 10 14:53:54 2015 UTC,"That could change quite easily.  For one thing, these are not based on an official version of the Turtles, so they may have less appeal in the long term.  I get the sense that this series is also going to be produced in far greater numbers than previous statues.  And each time there is a new set of statues produced, they saturate the market a little more.  That may seem like a minor point, but there have only been two major series of TMNT statues thus far.  But there are at least three being released this year.  (Prime Studios movie versions, the toon based ones from Ikon and these.)  I would be too quick to assume that any of them will increase in value too drastically."
TMNT,3csrdr,tmntman,1 point,Sat Jul 11 04:46:35 2015 UTC,Good info. I didn't realize these were so massively produced.
TMNT,3csrdr,tmntman,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:07:17 2015 UTC,"I don't know what the production numbers are.  I do know that the Playmates statues were suppose to be limited to no more than 2222 pieces each, and I believe that the number produced dropped with each release.  The Sideshow statue had production runs of under 1000 each if you combine the number of exclusive and regular versions.   Those statues sold out very quickly.   The Good Smile Co. ones have been up for preorder for quite some time so I'm assuming that they have sold more than a 1000 of each of them."
TMNT,3csrdr,vernonpost,2,Wed Jul 15 19:31:42 2015 UTC,"If you want a nice display piece, statues can be quite impressive.  And they tend to hold their value well, or at least the TMNT ones have since there have been so few of them.  If you are on the fence, these seem to be up for preorder everywhere.  So you should be able to wait and see the final product and still find them for a decent price.  If the style is an issue, there is another line coming from Ikon that are based on the original cartoon designs.  (listings on BBTS)  They are going to be slightly more expensive, but still under $200 each."
TMNT,3csrdr,vernonpost,1 point,Fri Jul 10 17:59:20 2015 UTC,I've seen these they look great but a little expensive not to much vs the ones I've been wanting to get.

TMNT Comics Primer  I prefere the IDW series honestly. As /u/tmntman said, it's better paced, and puts a really unique spin on the origin. It might be my favorite version of the turtles and I've consumed them all.  As for stand alone stories, the IDW run doesn't really have any unless you count the micro-series. The two I always suggest are the Soul's Winter trilogy for a completely different, but really beautiful interpretation of the core concept, and Tales of Leonardo: Blind Sight mini-arc from the Mirage series if you can find it. The art is simple, but really great and the concept is so well executed. I've always felt kind of blah about Leo, but that was the first story that made me really consider his character as having some real depth.  Good luck on your comic journey!"

TMNT,3crbjv,llikegiraffes,2,Sat Jul 11 01:29:08 2015 UTC,"Either the original Mirage comics or the current IDW series would be fine to start with.  The IDW series is probably easier to track down and better paced overall.   While the first volume of the Mirage comic ran for about 67 issues, only a limited number of those issues were by Eastman and Laird and form the core story line.  Those stories were collected into the Ultimate Collection hardcovers."
TMNT,3crbjv,tmntman,1 point,Fri Jul 10 04:23:39 2015 UTC,"The IDW series is just wrapping up, it'll have a total of 50 issues, and several spinoff stories total. I would suggest reading those first. I hadn't read any of the TMNT comics and I started with the IDW ones, and I thought they were amazing. It's great because they had around 30 years of material to go through to  make the comics. They use lots of characters from the original show, and the new show, and they have a lot of original characters too. It's probably my favorite comic series. Here's where I'd start off. It includes the first 12 issues, and a few of the spinoff comics."
TMNT,3crbjv,Charlie8090,2,Fri Jul 10 07:01:15 2015 UTC,I tweeted at Santolouco and he confirmed it is continuing past 50. It's terrible marketing by IDW to make it sound like it is ending.

I don't recall the price of the Lil Mikey figure but when it came out people were freaking out about the price so much they actually lowered it (which I'm guessing was really in them getting not many preorders so they lowered it.) but I don't think that will happen in this case. I'm sure their Madballs will be expensive too, but I remain hopeful they'll be somewhat affordable since they have no moving parts."

TMNT,3co8nh,tmntman,1 point,Thu Jul 9 23:11:53 2015 UTC,"I can think of two reasons.    1) Most people have a limited amount of disposable income per month.  Given that Mondo requires upfront payments on preorders, there are going to be a lot more people who can come up with $150 each month for four months than can come up with $600 all at once.  2) Mondo is not a big company and doesn't have much of a track record for action figure production.  I'm guessing their resources are limited.  So spacing out the production of the figures by a month probably helps on their end as well."

If I don't pre-order am I screwed/ eBay prices will be sky-high?  I loved the NECA figures when they were introduced, but I didn't want to spend that much on figures. I ended getting some knock-offs shipped to me about a month ago and am very pleased.  Any chance something like those could surface in a few years. I feel like their size alone would prevent any replication.  I need more deets MONDOOOOO!!"
TMNT,3co8nh,TTrain77,1 point,Fri Jul 10 14:46:08 2015 UTC,"It depends. They never did sell out of the Iron Giant preorders (still available at sideshow.com and mondotees.com) The first sketch mondo turtle has the limited edition (which is a certain quantity being procduced, and the rest are made to order. So those will most likely not appreciate more than what they are being sold for. The limted first sketch will most likely appreciate. Collecting is always a gamble and without any idea on how these will be released, it's really hard to say."
TMNT,3co8nh,MiCK_GaSM,1 point,Fri Jul 10 15:12:30 2015 UTC,"Thanks man!! that was really informative. I appreciate it! How'd you find out the the the rest of the first sketch turtle are made-to-order if you don't mind me asking. I would love to know if these are going to be made to order as well.   I'm thinking the Iron Giant has less of a fanbase and even less of a fanbase willing to spend $300 on a figure, cool as it may be.  Have you ordered from Mondo before?  Sounds like no one has any of their figures in hand at this point from the comments."
TMNT,3co8nh,vandamage2112,-3,Fri Jul 10 15:34:01 2015 UTC,"They look great until you look closely at them. For $150 ea. and at that scale, I expected better. My age is showing here, but this is kind of what I see.  I'm happy the OG turtles are getting so much love lately, though."

TMNT,3clee5,awoods5000,3,Thu Jul 9 01:42:45 2015 UTC,I love the IDW series. It's just the right mix of dark moments and light hearted moments that TMNT needs to be. Plus it does a great job of bringing in old stuff in a new light. While introducing completely new characters and ideas as well. I also love Bebop and Rocksteady in this series as well.

So are you looking for the cartoon based Turtles released in 2012 or the movie based ones released in 2014?  The Movie based ones are not that hard to find.  Big Bad Toy Store still had them in stock the last time I looked.  The toon style ones are tougher to find.  There are knockoffs available through eBay,  but it doesn't sound like the quality is great."

TMNT,3co98g,jestergoblin,0,Thu Jul 9 14:49:54 2015 UTC,"Makes sense, like $20 each then. Thanks. I'll think about it. I don't know if I need the movie ones though. Amazon has the classic toon ones for around $25 each, which isn't terrible... but Bebop/Rocksteady are really expensive."
TMNT,3co98g,Spidrmn1234,1 point,Thu Jul 9 15:10:07 2015 UTC,"Honestly, if Amazon has the classic ones for $25 - I would get them there. I paid $22 each when they came out.  As for Bebop and Rocksteady, they were/are Toys ""R"" Us exclusives, so that's why they are harder to find - but I've heard TRU Canada is overwhelmed with them so it can be cheaper to order from Canada and ship to the states."

TMNT,3cjyq6,IMMARUNNER,5,Wed Jul 8 14:30:32 2015 UTC,"I got the box set awhile back and have been making my way through them. I gotta say, they don't hold up these days. Every episode is just Shredder and Krang invented some new gadget that basically ignores the laws of nature/physics and can just do whatever it wants (like change any electronic device into a killing machine, or something that gives them ""infinite power"" or something) and then somehow either Shredder or Bebop and Rocksteady fuck everything up and their plan gets ruined, and then the turtles come in somewhere and do some fighting.   Every episode is compartmentalized too. There's really not that much continuation in the main story. Its just, This week shredder tried to do this and we stopped him.  Besides all that, its kind of frustrating with all of inconsistencies. Like changing voice actors episode-to-episode. And even completely changing animation styles to something kind of Looney-tunes-ish for a little while. It's strange watching them these days with an adult's awareness. It really makes me appreciate the job they've done with the newest Nick series. Kind of blows these old ones out of the water.   Having said all that, they are still one of the biggest parts of my childhood and I still love them.  *edit - I also forgot to mention that almost every joke is either a pun about pizza or turtle shells."
TMNT,3cjyq6,thrustinfreely,3,Wed Jul 8 17:43:26 2015 UTC,"The first season holds up pretty well and is vaguely connected. The animation is beautiful in it - but the rate that the series goes downhill is astounding.  Second season worked well too, and had a bit more running through it from a story standpoint.  But season 3 is where the show goes insane. Season 1 was 5 episodes, season 2 was 13 episodes.  Season 3 was 47 episodes. Everything took a hit with that insane schedule. Season 4 ramped the schedule up even more with 39 episodes in THREE MONTHS."
TMNT,3cjyq6,jestergoblin,1 point,Wed Jul 8 21:02:43 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I wish Playmates would have put the money into the show to make it all look as good as the original intro/first season animation looked."

I watched the show maybe a few times before it went off the air. It's almost too cheesy for my liking. I prefer the 2003 show."
TMNT,3cjyq6,Y2Spade,1 point,Wed Jul 8 22:29:04 2015 UTC,"Watching it with my kid right now. We just broke out my old toys that I dug out of the attic at my parents house too.  I think from an adult perspective it's not as good as it was when I was little. She's enjoying it a lot. I really like it for a trip down memory lane, and some episodes are surprisingly good.  The first 7 episodes in particular were very, very high quality. After that it started to waver a bit. We just started S3 (where I know the production schedule caused everything to take a hit).  I wanted to watch this series with her because she's a little young and the new turtles seem a bit dark for her age. This show is serving it's purpose and is a fun trip back to my childhood.  From a quality writing/animation perspective, the first 5 definitely hold up pretty well. Most of the Eye of Sarnath storyline is pretty good, though I must have missed a line somewhere because they seem to collect 4 crystals. The wiki seems to imply Shredder somehow lost one of the crystals and then it ended up at the amusement park (WTF?). Particularly enjoyed ""The Incredible Shrinking Turtles"" and ""The Curse of the Evil Eye"" from that set. Other gems from S2 are ""The Case of the Killer Pizzas"", ""Enter the Fly"", ""Invasion of the Punk Frogs"", and ""Splinter No More"". The finale was good too.  Anyways, I'd say the hit/miss ratio in S2 is probably about 70/30, which is not bad. We'll see how S3 goes, started it last night. Got 3 episodes in, the only one that was a little bonkers was the 50 foot Irma one >.<"

Over the years I more or less ignored it. I saw plenty of episodes but never really gave a crap about them or the flood of toys that came along with it..  A week or so ago my son said he wanted to see the old cartoon... Don't as me how he even knew it existed... Did they show a clip of it on the Nick show maybe? Anyway, I downloaded the first six for him to watch. They weren't as awful as my angsty teenage self thought. Its a good show but gimmie my old school Mirage Turtles any day."

TMNT,3cjyq6,Rheul,1 point,Thu Jul 9 02:25:14 2015 UTC,I hate them. I grew up with the live action movies and the 2k3 series before discovering the comics. After seeing and reading all those I tried giving the '87 series a try because it's so popular with other fans and it's terrible. All of the childishness of looney tunes without the comedy.
TMNT,3cjyq6,bionicragdoll,0,Wed Jul 8 19:52:30 2015 UTC,"I see a lot of hate in this sub for the '87 show. I grew up on this with no knowledge of the comic so it is my personal baseline to compare all other tmnt to. I like the fact that it is ""compartmentalized"", allowing an easy rewatch or first time view without requiring a large back story, every episode has some underlying moral to it, most of the time relevant even in today's standards, and although must of the jokes are puns, that's a lot of puns to think of, credit to the staff. In regards to the different animation styles, I view it as something similar to celebrity cameos in the animation department or an homage to those who inspire the animators. Lastly if watched and listened to closely enough, the writers ad in little jabs at the producers and others for lack of funding or being hurried and including references only parents could truly understand.   All in all I great show."

TMNT,3bphhw,AnIowaPunk,2,Wed Jul 1 02:44:37 2015 UTC,I would guess that it's going to be like the other two Turtle figures they have done.  They will open preorders for a limited time and then not make anymore. They say that they won't sell them after they fill the preorders. Mondo is a great company that does well by the license that they do. It'll probably be 60 to 90 dollars based on the other two that they've released.

Even though I know if changes weren't made to the script/screenplay of the last movie, it would have been a complete train wreck. But my curiosity would compel me to watch the original version just to see the ideas they were going with.  I love seeing concept arts, and ideas for things. That's a big selling point for me if that kind of stuff is included in a dvd's special features."
TMNT,3blmja,Delonce,1 point,Wed Jul 1 04:26:51 2015 UTC,I remain mad that we haven't gotten a comprehensive DVD release for ANY of the TMNT movies. Excluding the fourth one's deleted scene stuff.
TMNT,3blmja,Delonce,2,Wed Jul 1 04:33:23 2015 UTC,"Agreed. I was pretty disappointed that the bluray collection of the first 3 movies + the cgi movie that released for the 25th anniversary, was a bit bare-bones. It was just the same dvd's that had been released before.. Just in a different box."
TMNT,3biir5,TMNT-Fan-Site,2,Mon Jun 29 14:39:39 2015 UTC,"Considering the sudden inclusion of so many familiar characters in this sequel, I think that these ""easter eggs"" are just added fan service, as I predict the whole of the film will be one giant fan service. If the first film was any indication, the characters and devices in this sequel will be just as hollow in an attempt to play on nostalgia as a means to profit."
TMNT,3biir5,axlkomix,1 point,Tue Jun 30 13:53:41 2015 UTC,Couldn't agree more. I get down voted to hell every time I disparage the current film franchise. I don't get it.
TMNT,3biir5,joerdie,3,Tue Jun 30 15:33:52 2015 UTC,"I try to be unbiased, but it is very hard, being as invested in the characters as I am.   However, even looking at the film outside of my personal interests, and viewing it from a critical standpoint, it still isn't good, at all. All of the things that we know to make a good movie (writing, acting, etc.) are not there.   I don't alienate those that do like the movie, but I really don't understand how anyone can say it's ""good."" ""Enjoyable,"" maybe, if that is one's opinion, but to call it ""good,"" or ""not that bad,"" is a discredit to good film making and good storytelling."

TMNT,3b3z23,cobrashadowjoes,3,Thu Jun 25 19:50:01 2015 UTC,"I've never bought a con-exclusive before, but I remember when the new TMNT figures had just been announced, and SDCC (or maybe NYCC?) did a set with ridiculous paint apps. Like, even going so far as to airbrush on freckles for Mikey. And then I think they even did a vacu-chromed version of the Shredder figure? In any case, yeah the last few con figures I've seen have been rubbish. A ""stealth"" Leo figure, a b&w version of those shit-tastic comic figures from 2014, and now this. I mean, I understand cuts to make production costs (and therefore price points) low for mass retail releases. But these con figures are specifically supposed to be collector's items. They're not going for under ten dollars. So why not put a little more effort into them? I mean, can you imagine a set of Mystic Turtles with proper and over-the top paint apps????"
TMNT,3b3z23,DoktorFishopolis,1 point,Sat Jun 27 19:25:05 2015 UTC,"Why put more effort in if people will still buy just because they are exclusive? They can pocket the cash they would have spent on a new sculpt and just repaint something already set to for release.  Playmates is a company with stakeholders, they only truly care about the bottom line. People should put their cash towards incredible items like the First Gokin Krang or even Revoltech Turtles."

But I've already been buying them singly so it's either wait a couple years to get it all or just keep dishing out the money. Oh well. I don't really buy any other season on disc so I guess wasting it on one really good series isn't the worst."
TMNT,3ayoyr,umdraco,1 point,Wed Jun 24 17:22:32 2015 UTC,It was so difficult collecting the 2003 series. They really played with out patience and emotions.

I don't understand what's so difficult? There are hundreds of TV shows that properly put out box sets. Animated shows, or at least TMNT, suck at it."

Though there were Metal Mutant versions of Bebop and Rocksteady shown but not released here.    The Super Mutants were based on the design, but as you said, they did not have the transformation feature.  And the Dark Devil Shredder shown in that commercial as well as the Turtle Saint (the combined form of all four Turtles) were only released in Japan.    The final series was the Mutant Masters.  They did have a transformation feature similar to that shown in the ad.  They were released both here and in Japan.  Japan also got a few exclusive Mini-Mutant sets around the same time."

TMNT,3aqqty,DoktorFishopolis,1 point,Tue Jun 23 05:45:21 2015 UTC,They are sort of an oddity.  They don't show up in the OVA as far as I've seen.  But they seem to have been created at the same time and were released in Japan.
TMNT,3aqqty,tmntman,1 point,Tue Jun 23 18:35:09 2015 UTC,"I wish Playmates would re-release some of these. Or at least do more rereleases than the standard ""first two waves of the old toys"".

TMNT,3aqqty,DoktorFishopolis,2,Tue Jun 23 18:37:09 2015 UTC,"I don't think there is much of a market for this type of reissue.  They weren't exactly huge sellers the first time around.  And while I have some model kits based on the original series action figures, I haven't seen any for the Super Mutants.  There is however a company that showed off some small, stylized vinyl figures last year at SDCC based on the Mutant Masters.  I don't know if they'll ever get released though."

TMNT,3adhj3,IvorySwings,2,Fri Jun 19 12:54:59 2015 UTC,"Yeah, #13 and #18 aren't in there because they weren't produced/created/what-have-you by Eastman and/or Laird.  Be aware that the ultimate collection hardcovers do not collect the complete Mirage Vol. 1, despite what the marketing may lead you to believe.  They actually collect only those issues that were directly created by the original creators, Eastman and Laird.  Thus, after Vol. 3, they skip way ahead to issue #48, which is when Eastman and Laird began working on the series again."

TMNT,3adhj3,IvorySwings,2,Mon Jun 22 00:21:46 2015 UTC,"Yes.  As I said, the Ultimate Collection hardcovers only collect Eastman's & Laird's original work.  But virtually all of the other issues produced by Mirage are collected in the TMNT Classics line of trade paperbacks.  They seem to be collected thematically, which means they aren't necessarily collected chronologically, unfortunately.  But they're pretty much all there.  At this point, they've released enough trades that I believe they're currently in the midst of releasing the second run of Mirage comics."

TMNT,3a8op0,gothams_shadowknight,9,Thu Jun 18 02:43:09 2015 UTC,"I don't know about casting, but as for the story, I'd actually stick close to the 1990 movie, although maybe integrate Baxter Stockman and the Mousers into it, allowing me to drop the April-as-reporter schtick. And change the injured turtle back into Leo instead of Raph.  For sequels, something with the Utroms. Maybe a little bit of the ""Turtles in Space"" arc from the Mirage comics. Perhaps work Leatherhead into it somewhere. Then to cap off the trilogy, ""City at War"". Introduce Karai and have the Turtles caught in the crossfire between her faction of the Foot, what's left of the Shredder's faction, as well as the Utroms and perhaps Stockman, to tie it all up.  So, basically, a trilogy of movies based on the Mirage Comics, more or less."
TMNT,3a8op0,DrFurball,2,Thu Jun 18 06:48:52 2015 UTC,"Mirage comics all the way. Also, make it rated R with cursing and the turtles actually killing people.   Maybe even make it a Netflix series, not movie, rated R. Like Daredevil. Dark and gritty."
TMNT,3a8op0,Danny_Disco,0,Thu Jun 18 12:28:57 2015 UTC,"Forgive me for just stepping in to rain on your parade, but an R-rated TMNT just would not work. Not that it wouldn't work as a story, but you can't market an R-rated TMNT. Regardless of its adult fandom, the mass fan-base is still children; if I could go back and change things so that the '80s cartoon was never made I would, but such is the world.  The best we could ever hope for is a PG-13 rating that pushes the limitations.  EDIT: Re-thinking it, the series option isn't out of the question. I suppose there is an option of running two or more products for different audiences simultaneously. However, I just don't see a studio doing that. The execs are likely to stay in their comfort zone and continue to market these characters to children, as that's where the most profitability lies."
TMNT,3a8op0,axlkomix,2,Thu Jun 18 13:41:33 2015 UTC,The Dark Knight was PG-13 . . . you can have a lot of violence nowadays and keep the movie PG-13.
TMNT,3a8op0,ShawnisMaximus,2,Thu Jun 18 20:22:32 2015 UTC,"Realistically, I agree with you 100%. The question was posed hypothetically, so my answer was as well.   I think with all the success of Daredevil and Orange is the New Black, a Netflix original series is the way to go. Daredevil is rated R, as is Orange is the New Black. The format also allows for so much more story. More origin story, more story arcs. It's such a better format for TMNT media that will follow closely to the original source. Also, with no cursing, drinking, and nudity you have yourself a PG-13 rating. Win-win."
TMNT,3a8op0,Danny_Disco,1 point,Thu Jun 18 22:59:11 2015 UTC,"Now would this be a 1980s PG-13, which is closer to R today? Or a PG-13 today, which is closer to a PG rating in the 1980s?"
TMNT,3a8op0,lsmucker,9,Thu Jun 18 16:32:44 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I would Rather just do animated movies of the new IDW Comics.  Straight to DVD releases just like DC with their IPs.  As for the voices, just use the Nick TMNT voices, those guys know how to fill the positions correctly (Napoleon Bonafrog, Mondo Gecko, perfect!)"
TMNT,3a8op0,przacjames,2,Thu Jun 18 12:23:39 2015 UTC,I'd buy the shit out of them. I know everyone is getting tired of crowd-funding but if there was a campaign for this I'd back it without hesitation.

TMNT,3a8op0,natnotnate,4,Thu Jun 18 15:05:53 2015 UTC,"I always liked the idea of making a trilogy in which splinter dies and fractures the brotherhood of the turtles.  First one ends with a showdown in which splinter dies. Hear me out. Leo blames himself and takes off to Japan to become a better leader. Raph, furious, teams up with Casey and tracks Shredder down across the country, eventually finding him in LA. Mikey and Donnie and April just keep doing their own thing in NY, no clue where their brothers/Casey are. While in Japan, Leo wanders the countryside, broken, and one night during a terrible storm takes refuge inside an old Shinto temple and really breaks down. He then befriends an old, blind sword maker, who happened to be in the temple and takes care of him. The sword maker becomes a father figure to him, very sage-like, helps him to understand life and loss.  Raph and Casey find Shredder working with the Yakuza or someone similar. One of them gets captured forcing the other to contact April to tell the turtles where they are. Mikey, April and Donnie still no clue where Leo is, set off across the country to find Raph/Casey in LA.  Back in Japan, the sword maker passes away due to old age, and reveals that he knew Leo wasn't human the whole time, and let's Leo know that his father's death wasn't his fault, that it was just another part of life and Splinter will always be with him.  After burying his friend, he boards a boat bound for America, LA in particular.  Mikey, Donnie and April, meet up with Casey/Raph in LA, and track down the captured one. April gets a call from Leo letting her know he's coming home, he's landed in LA, she fills him in on everything. He meets up with them. They see Shredder in the room with the captured person.   The turtles rush in and let their rage fill them. Shredder just backs away and fights on the defense, April frees Casey/Raph. He runs between them and stops the fight. Big reveal is Shredder didn't kill splinter. Kraang did, Shredder respected Splinter blah blah blah. During this Kraang shows up and we're left with a bit of a cliff hanger.   Third movie Shredder and the Turtles team up and chase Kraang into Dimension X, maybe through time.. That one I haven't ever really laid out.. I just liked the idea of having the turtles in LA and Leo in Japan."
TMNT,3a8op0,Popea1icious,2,Thu Jun 18 13:56:02 2015 UTC,"awesome thread is awesome.  all good points from the appropriate audiences and how an ""R"" rating would work... however i would give my right arm to see 'Return to New York' as a full-on blown out panel for panel film.  Either that or an interpretation of the IDW franchise presently running.  On that note - I got a little carried away a few weeks back and did a major fantasy voice cast for that whole idea... I would love it if anyone took a look, criticized, conversed, whatever with me about it!  http://www.reddit.com/r/TMNT/comments/2ydfyh/fantasy_voice_cast_the_idw_movie/"
TMNT,3a8op0,bryanvangelder,2,Thu Jun 18 15:20:04 2015 UTC,"I would not direct the movie myself. Basically, I'd be filling the role of the producer. I'd choose Joss Whedon to direct because he's great with ensemble casts. Too many TMNT movies tend to focus on one turtle more so than the others, and I think Whedon wouldn't make that mistake. I'm looking at you, 2007!  I'd get Ang Lee for cinematography, because he'll make it beautiful to look at, and I'd try to get Eastman and Laird to work on the script to try and stick to the original concepts of the turtles' characters as much as possible. I'd bring in the IDW staff (which I believe includes Kevin Eastman) for storyboarding and ideas.  As for voice actors for the turtles, I'm not sure. I would want them to sound the part, so I'd probably listen to them blindly - not looking at their faces or knowing their names. I'd also want them to be fans of their selected character prior to being hired - or at least a fan of some incarnation of the franchise. I guess I'd put Andrea Romano (who, incidentally, is in charge of the current 2012 series) in charge of casting.   As for the story, I'd probably want to adapt the IDW series, both because it's fucking awesome and it hasn't been adapted to the screen yet. That, or go with /u/DrFurball's idea and utilize major arcs from the original Mirage comics. (There's a reason Leo's been injured in different incarnations more often than Raph; it's part of his character development, and it's the original canon.)  Lastly, I'd give all the turtles Lower East Side accents - not just Raph."
TMNT,3a8op0,CalicoFox,2,Sat Jun 20 19:41:41 2015 UTC,Probably wouldn't do a movie. I'd like to see a Daredevil-esque show that bounces between flashbacks of their childhood with Splinter and their present day adventures based of the Mirage comics. Keep that same dark gritty feel that they had. No idea who the cast would be though.
TMNT,3a8op0,bionicragdoll,4,Tue Jun 23 14:47:47 2015 UTC,"Jay Baruchel as Donnie  Channing Tatum as Raph  Christopher Mintz-Platz as Mikey  Jensen Ackles as Leo  Who's a famous Japanese voice actor who can speak English? Cast him as Splinter.  Do the same for Shredder but drop the ""voice"" out of the previous statement.  AnnaSophia Robb as April? Maybe? I dunno, she was the first name who popped up into my head. If her acting abilities aren't up to snuff how about...Chloe Moretz? She could be a good April, I guess.  As far as what it would be about, I don't know if we could do a full origin movie on TMNT. Origin stories are played out, yeah but we've never quite gotten much out of TMNT other than montages (1990 and 2014), so I would like to see an origin story where we watch the little turtles grow for at least 20 minutes.  If that's out, then I'd just pluck a story arc from the 2K3 series, flesh it out, and there you go. It'd be a good combination of bullshit popcorn summer flick and coherent storytelling with pacing that will make you leave the theater feeling like you got your money's worth.  (Then, I'd sell the fuck out and try and get a Mighty Mutimals spin-off movie off the ground.)"
TMNT,3a8op0,Y2Spade,4,Thu Jun 18 03:13:53 2015 UTC,"I'd like the 20 minute origin story as well, Excellent Casting Choices! Darren Dunstan could voice splinter (not japanese but he voiced him in the 2004 cartoon). I was thinking of Casting Jet Li as shredder what do you think? Good choices for April I would kinda want to see Emma Stone as April as well."
TMNT,3a8op0,Y2Spade,3,Thu Jun 18 03:39:28 2015 UTC,"I'm not all that into Emma Stone, but Jet Li as Shredder could be really cool, good suggestion. As far as Darren Dunstan, I'd hire him in a heartbeat. Or anybody who could mimic his voice from the first two movies."
TMNT,3a8op0,ShawnisMaximus,1 point,Thu Jun 18 03:49:13 2015 UTC,I would like a spiritual sequel to the first two ninja turtles movies from the 90s.  Get rid of the over the top ridiculous action of the Michael Bay movie and have more realistic stunts performed by stunt men in similar suits. Less CGI. Skip the orgin story and have the turtles already established and have them already defeated Shredder. Concentrate on Karai and maybe Baxter Stockman. Keep it somewhat campy but also a little dark (like the first one).   Emma Stone for April I'd have to think a bit for voice actors for the turtles.
TMNT,3a8op0,paintnwood,1 point,Thu Jun 18 20:30:10 2015 UTC,"Current IDW comics and Idris Elba as Baxter, Ken Watanabe as Shredder AND the voice of Splinter but two very different voices, Elizabeth Olsen as April, Jake Gyllenhaal as Casey, Tom Hanks as Honeycutt, John Goodman as Herman, Sean Astin or Josh Pais as Raph, Greg Cipes as Mikey, Jensen Ackles as Leo, and Corey Feldman as Donnie.

TMNT,39cqp0,purpledrag67,1 point,Thu Jun 11 03:00:18 2015 UTC,"I can get onboard with these suggestions. I would have preferred if they saved shredder for the sequel. Give more of the first movie for character development. Introducing Casey in the first one would have been great. Baxter as the main baddie in movie 1 would have been a good choice. After he fails to take care of the turtles, he requests the help of the foot clan. When that goes badly, shredder himself gets involved.  Second movie would deal with the turtles dealing with the aftermath of Baxter. Leo goes on a training run. On this run, he comes across shredder and the foot. Even though they have never met, Leo knows exactly who he's facing due to the stories he's heard from splinter. Shredder damn near kills Leo. Leo's body gets delivered to his family.  That would be an amazing way to introduce shredder to the turtles. Movie ends with an amazing battle against shredder and his clan on rooftop. Shredder gets ""killed"". Turtles celebrate. Next movie shredder gets krangs help, and he goes supermutant."

TMNT,38yl8o,Not_a_Horse_Tornado,4,Sun Jun 7 23:07:35 2015 UTC,"This is just my observation/speculation, but I think it comes down to Playmate trying very hard to keep the price of TMNT action figures low.  While most lines have seen the price tags grow considerably in the last 10 to 15 years (Marvel legends figures have more than doubled)  TMNT figures have remained under $10.  That's great for parents who don't want to break the bank every time a new mutant is released.  But for collectors, the sacrifices that have to be made to keep the prices that low can be a real turn off.  The most obvious sacrifice lately has been with the amount of paint applications that figures have.  Personally, I would be fine with a slight price increase to improve the quality.  But if they are going to make compromises to lower costs, I'd rather it be in the paint which I could realistically touch up/improve if it really bothered me instead of compromising articulation or sculpt which I lack the talent needed to successfully alter.  But getting back to the issue of the apparent variation in quality, I suspect it is a matter of budgets.  With certain characters/variations of characters, Playmates can reasonably expect to sell more of that figure and keep it in circulation longer.  And sometimes they can reuse parts of figures to cut down on the cost of future figures.  In these instances, they are probably willing to spend more per figure than average knowing that they will recoup that cost over the long run.  But with more obscure characters or variations like the LARP Turtles, there's little chance that Playmates will be able to reuse those parts in the future.  So they have to be able to recover the full cost of creating those figures over a much smaller production run and the quality suffers."
TMNT,38yl8o,tmntman,1 point,Mon Jun 8 02:52:47 2015 UTC,Marvel Legends have more than tripled. They used to be $5.99-$6.99 when the series debuted.

Like, great paint apps, decent accessories, not to mention loads of articulation. It's like they made that first wave just to get people back in, then said ""Well, we've got a license to print money again, so let's just put out whatever""  I really wish someone good and affordable would get the movie license."

TMNT,38yl8o,CJSchmidt,1 point,Tue Jun 9 05:11:04 2015 UTC,"My theory is that these figures were designed while the show was still in development. No one knew if the show would be a success or not and there was probably an internal debate about the style. The first round of figures were good looking hybrids designed to appeal to everyone so that even if the cartoon was a flop or didn't get picked up they would have a really nice run of turtle figures that would appeal to everyone and were guaranteed to sell.  When the cartoon became a hit, they realized that they were going to spend a lot of time and money making the figures NOT look like they do on TV. The simplified designed are cheaper, easier and make for better kids toys (no excuse for the crappy paint jobs though).  I really hope they go back and do detailed figures in the style of the original set for more of the core characters later. Even if it costs a few more dollars."

If you keep an eye on comixology, they seem to have a sale of everything up to a current volume periodically* for about half price. People usually post on this sub when it happens. Aside from being the best TMNT comics, it's one of the better series I've read in general. Don't skip out on the miniseries either. There are a few volumes of hero and villain stories plus some one shot backstories that are just as good. I haven't read a bad issue in the series yet. Of course you can get the volumes in print too but it will cost much more, but is still worth it if you have the funds and the space."

Donatello and Mikey were the hardest for me. Mikey always had really derpy eyes, and Don would often have a few purple smudges and his mask would be off. The more common problem with Leo would be his mask. It wouldn't have enough blue in it, and you could see green bleeding through. And it was a little bit hard to find one without party of his eye printed onto the mask.  No problems with Raphael though."

I'm really looking forward to a TMNT tabletop game, so I hope this one is worthwhile and appeals to fans of all ages and not just children."
TMNT,38djx3,wallcrawlinghero,2,Wed Jun 3 15:35:07 2015 UTC,"I'm actually co-host on one of the most popular Heroclix podcasts! I'd be happy to answer any questions about the game anyone might have.  Effectively the figures are on bases called clix, as a figure takes damage you click the figure to the right one for each damage taken and their abilities/stats change. IE: Most figures lose stats and shift powers as they take damage, but some (like a Hulk for instance) might grow stronger.  The primary stats are Range, Movement, Attack, Defense, and Damage. You play on a gridded map and one player makes actions with their team (choosing to move, attack, or such for each figure), then the other player does the same.  Attacks are resolved using a 2D6 system, you have your attack value (let's say a 10) you look at your opponent's defense value (Let's say 17), you have to roll a 7 or higher to hit, and when you do, they take damage equal to your damage value.  What makes the game complex and deep is the powers system, there are a variety of powers that are designated by colored squares around a number, IE:  A red box around your Attack stat indicates you have Blades/Claws/Fangs, an ability that makes it so that when you roll a melee attack, after hitting you roll a D6 and replace your damage with that value.  A light green box around your defense stat means you have Combat Reflexes, which gives you an extra +2 defense when you're attacked in melee.  Overall its daunting at first, but really simple when you get things down pat. Honestly the game plays at its absolute best with martial artist like figures (the Street Fighter set, Assassin's Creed set, and most of the martial artists in the comic universes are absolutely my favorite pieces to play with) so I'm totally hype not just as a TMNT fan, but as a fan of those kinds of clix."
TMNT,38djx3,__xylek__,2,Wed Jun 3 15:42:19 2015 UTC,"Wow, awesome! Thanks for the in-depth reply. I've seen these around for years, but never got into them or knew anyone who played. So, the game is pretty much just fighting your team against other teams, right? I used to play Mordheim with a friend, which sounds similar, but with lots of charts and tables instead of the clix bases; just two (or more) teams trying to take each other out on a small map.  Is there any sort of narrative built in, or even lasting leveling effects for your team across fights, or is it just purely battling each other match to match with stats resetting at the end?  And lastly, on the figures, it sounds like there is a rarity system built into it. How hard do you expect it might be to find some of the rare figures in a set like this and how expensive do they get? And do the figures always come painted, or can they be removed from the bases and repainted?  Sorry for all the questions, but I'm very excited at the prospect of a new TMNT tabletop game. I started reading through the HeroClix rules, but it's a bit daunting without the figures in front of me."
TMNT,38djx3,soliddrake83,2,Wed Jun 3 16:05:09 2015 UTC,"No problem! Ask away.  Each match is independent, the running gag is that its ""Superhero Chess"" and its the best way to explain it. You place your pieces to start, play a match, based on results go play the next match. Typically you play it almost like a TCG when it comes to tournaments (Swiss or Single Elimination.)  Rarity is interesting, the typical larger Heroclix sets come in 5 figure booster packs that MSRP $12.50 each, with a full ""brick"" of boosters being 10 boosters.  At absolute minimum a pack will have 1 Rare, 2 Uncommon, 2 Common figures. On average one booster per brick has a Chase figure (which usually there are 5-7 per set) that are typically ""alternate universe"" characters or special versions of major characters. They aren't typically power pieces though, and are usually more of collector things.  There are also smaller ""Gravity Feed"" sets, each package contains one single figure at $2.50 each. The rarities on these fluctuate wildly but a brick of 24 of the packages usually always contains a chase if there is one in the set (although sometimes its every other brick.)  I'm not sure which they'll do for TMNT, they'll probably do a gravity feed first to test the waters on how well the property will sell. Typically side-properties get a gravity feed set or two (Yugioh has 3 gravity feed sets now for instance.)  I hope they'll do a 5 figure set right out of the gate, but that would require like 50-70 unique characters immediately. Typically sets also have ""generic"" figures at common which means like Foot Ninjas or such, characters that aren't specific characters and you'd want a ton of.  Figures come prepainted, but I've repainted a ton of them personally. You definitely have to prime over them (I use Citadel spray primer) before repainting though as their sealant they use does NOT like to keep paint on it. They can be ""broken"" off of their clix bases easy for painting though."
TMNT,38djx3,Superkaiju,2,Wed Jun 3 16:15:21 2015 UTC,"Cool, thanks! It makes much more sense now. I guess I'll wait and see what happens with it. Maybe I'll pick up a few sets to familiarize myself with the game in the mean time."

TMNT,38bpcv,_tylerthedestroyer_,2,Wed Jun 3 18:32:03 2015 UTC,I am by no means excited for this film considering my feelings towards the first but it really does bother me that they keep talking about things being cannonically correct and then comparing said elements to the 80's cartoon...it seems as though the writer has no knowledge of the Mirage comics and that those comics are the source material
TMNT,38bpcv,danhimself36,1 point,Thu Jun 4 02:39:25 2015 UTC,"You're right, but for most people that know TMNT, they are much more familiar with either the 80s cartoon or the 2003 cartoon.

TMNT,37x710,Eurymedion,2,Sun May 31 19:14:40 2015 UTC,"I don't have a favourite turtle because it's so easy to identify a bit of myself in all of them, making it difficult for me to pick just one. I love them in all in equal measure.  I share Leo's sense of responsibility, of family, duty, and honour, but, like him in some incarnations, I also have a bad tendency to brood.  I, unfortunately, have something akin to Raph's explosive temper, which I've gotten better at controlling, thankfully.  I have Donnie's thirst for knowledge and naturally curious mind. Too bad I don't have any of his super genius qualities!  And, as I grow older, I'm becoming more relaxed, fun-loving, and spontaneous like Mikey.  That's the wonderful thing about the Turtles. Everybody (or maybe almost everybody) can find an identifiable trait in one - or all - of them and quickly become fans."
TMNT,37x710,BridgetheDivide,3,Mon Jun 1 03:07:38 2015 UTC,Mikey- His upbeat attitude in the face of impossible odds is refreshing.  Leo - You have to respect him for being able to balance his responsibility as leader and his desire to goof off witb his brothers ever now and again.  Donny - Reptile Reed Richards is pretty cool.  Raph - not often than not he is just the generic hot headed rebel.
TMNT,37x710,Scubetrolis,2,Sun May 31 05:28:52 2015 UTC,"Well, as a kid my brothers and I would always pretend to be the turtles, and I was always Donnie because I liked purple. So, he's been my favorite."

I always thought Leo was a bit annoying back in the old days.  2014 movie... Leo, Mikey, Raph, and Donny.    I can relate to all of their personalities - I think we all can - but it's the way it's presented in each movie version that differs.  Like in the 2014 movie I went in, Oooh, can't wait to see Raph and was slightly disappointed.  And then was surprised with this version of Leo, cause he was more intense and less whiney than the 90's version --- Or maybe I'm just older and prefer that tempo.  lol!"

TMNT,37x710,sonofseriousinjury,1 point,Thu Jun 4 16:37:34 2015 UTC,"Leo is definitely my favorite. He's always been the one I identified with/idolized the most. He and Raph are both kind of the loners of the group, but for different reasons. While Raph is a loner due to his anger/angst, Leo is a loner because of his responsibilities/empathy. He knows that he has to step up and be the one to guide them when Splinter isn't around and that takes a lot out of him. He always wants what is best for his brothers and generally everybody else involved in their lives.  Leo's very hard on himself, a problem I have, but it's because he knows he needs to be better for the sake of those around him. He isn't the impulsive one, the reactionary one, or the analytical one; he's the one that balances everybody else out and creates the bonds that hold their family together."

I'm just hoping they remove Donnie's glasses.  To answer your question straight-up, we haven't heard anything yet."
TMNT,37thv4,Y2Spade,3,Sat May 30 07:08:05 2015 UTC,"Donatello was the only one that looked really stupid, to me. The others were decent, but those glasses were just so over the top."

It doesn't even make sense to have him wear glasses, considering he's a mutant - and funny enough bullet proof! so why doesn't he have perfect vision?!  ah-hah. I thought Leo looked by far the closest to the original 90s turtles.  Raph's aesthetic bugged me tho.  Can't pin point exactly what it is, but it's just bugs me."

TMNT,37thv4,ninjartist,3,Tue Jun 2 20:21:43 2015 UTC,"I think we'll see a change, partly because they cast new actors for Shredder and Karai. However, I don't think a design change would be drastic (don't want to confuse people into thinking it's a reboot). Hopefully the turtles are at least slightly smaller, with maybe a few less knick-knacks hanging off of them."
TMNT,37thv4,Delonce,3,Sat May 30 21:20:04 2015 UTC,"Making them a little smaller would probably be the best design change. They are way too tall in the first one. And their shells are massive. Their overall proportions are ok, I think. But jeez... How the hell would they fit through a manhole to get into the sewers? You can't be that stealthy when your a hulk."
TMNT,37thv4,jestergoblin,2,Sun May 31 06:06:11 2015 UTC,"If the turtles were Tokka or Slash, the scale was fine, but as creatures that live in the sewer... how the hell did they get out of manhole covers?"
TMNT,37thv4,AnIowaPunk,2,Sun May 31 21:55:21 2015 UTC,"Like Y2Spade said, they haven't said anything, and we probably won't know till a trailer is released.  As someone pointed out in another thread, it looks like on the motion capture suit the shells aren't as big and don't ride as high as when they filmed the first one.  This may mean that they have redesigned the characters a bit or it might just be something different about the tech they are using.  I personally think that they will change the appearance a bit.  It make sense from a business side and it will also please fans as well.  If they change the designs then it gives kids another reason to get the new toys and merchandise.  They have to do something different so kids aren't buying the same exact toy they bought a year ago.  And remember they changed the designs in the original 1990 movie to the sequel.  It was still Jim Henson Studios, but the turtles were tweaked a little.  So it's not unheard of to change the design."
TMNT,37thv4,DoktorFishopolis,1 point,Sat May 30 08:06:16 2015 UTC,"I just feel like when you've made a commitment to an aesthetic, you should stick to it, or at least to the parts of it that worked. Personally I would like to see less ""flair"" on the designs. The sunglasses and beads and whatnot. Or at the very least trim Donnie's gear down a little. If he's got Splinter Cell goggles, does he really need glasses?"

She would sing the songs, wear the suits, you name it. You could tell her family was a bit embarrassed, but she gives no shits.  I almost felt embarrassed for her, but on the other hand.... A part of me wants to be like that a little bit."

TMNT,37rw36,TN_Tony,5,Fri May 29 22:02:10 2015 UTC,"I think some necessary measures are being made with this sequel in response to the negative backlash from the first film. There might be some retconning and/or ignoring certain things from the original to try to produce something much better, which I'm very okay with so long as they succeed."
TMNT,37rw36,axlkomix,2,Mon Jun 1 15:46:51 2015 UTC,Its almost as if shitty writers and directors don't care about continuity.
TMNT,37rw36,Soperos,10,Fri May 29 23:08:51 2015 UTC,"There was so much wrong with the first one, I'd actually PREFER they broke continuity just to get things back on track."
TMNT,37rw36,brittonk,0,Fri May 29 23:59:09 2015 UTC,"I agree with you completely on that. But we both know that won't be the case with Michael ""the childhood killer"" Bay.   I will never be able to look past ShredderTron."
TMNT,37rw36,Soperos,2,Sat May 30 00:00:57 2015 UTC,Bay wasn't even the director of the first one! Calling these movies Michael Bay movies is like calling Transformers a Steven Spielberg movie.
TMNT,37rw36,bacobits,1 point,Wed Jun 3 05:24:02 2015 UTC,Either way. Any movie he is attached to (minus Bad Boys and Armageddon) is usually shit. I personally did not like the movie at all and I was really excited going into it so its not like I convinced myself I would hate it.   Edit: Just checked my post. Where did I say he was directing?

TMNT,37nhfu,TheImplausibleHulk,5,Fri May 29 00:57:06 2015 UTC,"Finally some movie positivity in this sub!  I really enjoyed the first movie and I am looking forward to the sequel. I don't think the first movie had a good script, but the action,humour and the turtles were great..so more turtles and less people in the sequel and the sequel will be great!"
TMNT,37nhfu,dragonsky,11,Fri May 29 01:49:35 2015 UTC,"I didn't like the first one - weak story, grotesque turtles, pointless changes to the origin, and Eric Sachs? Ugh. But I will forgive all of that if they make up for it by giving us a big screen adaption of the classic cartoon...which some of us have wanted to see for almost 30 years! I'll never forget how disappointed I was that Tokka and Razhar weren't Rocksteady and Bebop!"
TMNT,37nhfu,cartoonistaaron,6,Fri May 29 02:45:07 2015 UTC,"I in the same boat in that I didn't care for the new movie at all. Everything I've seen about this one has gotten my hopes up- Old April O'Neal, Foot Clan ninjas,  new Shredder, Stephen Amell as Casey Jones, new director, and now this.  I... I may see this in theater with my kids."
TMNT,37nhfu,Samoht2113,3,Fri May 29 03:32:56 2015 UTC,I would love for them to adjust the Shrek Turtles into something more palatable but I highly doubt that's going to happen.

Joe 2 opens with them basically killing off the entire cast of the first movie then showing you Cobra Commander that looks like Cobra Commander.  If TMNT2 opens with the turtles dropping all their excessive gear and clothes, the true Shredder showing up and killing off the impostors from the first movie and then goes straight into mutant mayhem, I will be thrilled."
TMNT,37nhfu,jestergoblin,3,Fri May 29 14:04:58 2015 UTC,I've never understood why it's so difficult for movies to actually be faithful to the source material
TMNT,37nhfu,fidelio123,3,Fri May 29 14:23:57 2015 UTC,"Because ""that won't translate well onto the silver screen"".  Yes it fucking will. You're just too lazy to actually try and make it work and would rather phone it in with rehashed movie tropes because you don't actually give a shit about the source material. If Hollywood can make Guardians of the Galaxy work as a movie, then anything can work with the right treatment."

I still really like and own the 2014 one. These pics are awesome and It's just as exciting for me as the first without the people crying over the fact that it wasn't the same exact movie as the 90's with some better graphics.

TMNT,37nhfu,_tylerthedestroyer_,8,Fri May 29 02:19:01 2015 UTC,"YES! The minute I saw that picture of Bebop and Rocksteady getting coffee in mostly cartoon-accurate outfits, it was like I accepted their apology."
TMNT,37nhfu,cartoonistaaron,2,Fri May 29 02:46:09 2015 UTC,Tyler Perry as Baxter Stockman though?
TMNT,37nhfu,LOUCIFER_315,9,Fri May 29 03:06:14 2015 UTC,Tyler Perry's movies are crap.  Tyler Perry acting in movies he's not directing - pretty damn decent to very good.
TMNT,37nhfu,ilikemyteasweet,3,Fri May 29 04:28:01 2015 UTC,He's great in Gone Girl.
TMNT,37nhfu,annoyinglyclever,8,Fri May 29 14:10:52 2015 UTC,He might do a good job. Slightly crazy yet intelligent black guy(only mentioning race cause comic and new nick series) seems right up Tyler Perry's alley.
TMNT,37nhfu,Samoht2113,2,Fri May 29 03:35:11 2015 UTC,I know absolutely nothing about the new shows and I'm just remembering the classic cartoon. I also haven't seen the first movie so again I know nothing about it or the fact that Baxter Stockman was remade as a black character. I'm too old I guess
TMNT,37nhfu,LOUCIFER_315,9,Fri May 29 03:46:17 2015 UTC,"Baxter Stockman was black in the original comics, but was made white for the cartoon to avoid any slavery implications considering his relationship to Shredder. I like having a black Baxter because that's how he was originally imagined."
TMNT,37nhfu,lukenog,3,Fri May 29 04:04:19 2015 UTC,"The show is what I watched first as a kid. Didn't read the comics until about two years ago. If you have time,  I highly recommend the originals. I'm pretty far behind on the new show but season one did a hell of a job with the Turtles. Assuming the quality continued,  it's my favorite  version of the Turtles yet.  And as someone else pointed out,  Baxter was originally black in the comics."
TMNT,37nhfu,Samoht2113,6,Fri May 29 05:41:53 2015 UTC,"I think the 2012 tmnt series after the first season got better the story lines with karai and the other side characters like xever, stockman and the others also the creators and the writers of the show fuck with your emotions season 2 and 3 but I love the show and it's one of the best shows since Korra ended"
TMNT,37nhfu,Phantom133,2,Fri May 29 06:01:46 2015 UTC,I was REALLY hoping for Vondie Curtis-Hall. Loved him in Daredevil and I think he'd make an awesome Baxter Stockman.

However, if this movie is supposed to be taking place in 2015, I'm not sure how many '80s looking punks are running around. I know trying to modernize would be met with extreme backlash (look at Jared Leto's Joker with all the tattoos as an example). I think it'll look out of place with the rest of the modern setting. Unless it's some weird hipster punk movement?"

I think we ARE going to get some kind of connection between Shredder and Splinter in this movie, unlike in the previous one. That was my biggest problem with it. Splinter and Shredder were just...fighting. There wasn't any emotional connection between them, like in the cartoons and 90's movie. So happy that by the look they're fixing it. And the Foot Clan looks great too. As they're ninjas again, and not terrorists, we might get more hand-to-hand combat, which is nice. Seriously can't wait for the movie."

The other is that they keep adding more and more characters, how will it actually fit together as a plot."
TMNT,37hzt2,vandamage2112,2,Wed May 27 21:39:59 2015 UTC,Yes I have an issue with the same writers and also I'm excited but scared thinking this movie will be our TMNT spider-man 3 film!  Excited! but scared at the same time.

TMNT,37hzt2,manfly,2,Wed May 27 21:55:10 2015 UTC,Or it could be the classic hollywood tradition of casting a younger actress over an older one.

IIRC, this is from the same time period, give or take a year, as the Bucky O'Hare cartoon. (With a great, forgotten theme song.) I guess they thought rabbits in space was going to be a thing."

Looks like they're setting up the Pantheon endgame, which means I should probably go read the Ghostbusters tie-in.  But damn, am I sick of the Casey/Hun storyline.  I feel like it keeps halfway resolving, then falling apart all over again.  Hopefully it wraps up for good next time...   On the bright side, lots of great character moments with Mikey, Donnie, Alopex, and Angel.  And Santolouco's art is as drool-worthy as ever."

TMNT,37ge8t,spookycookies,2,Sun May 31 23:59:47 2015 UTC,I like Stockman as a big villain. As a guy who never really read the original comics this Stockman is so so much better then any other version ive seen.
TMNT,37e7a2,voltron1776,5,Tue May 26 23:51:56 2015 UTC,I'm shocked that they managed to keep krang so obnoxious even in a different language.

TMNT,37e7a2,CameronMcCasland,3,Wed May 27 02:13:26 2015 UTC,I remember the toys when they came out. Ronin Warriors also came out the same time. I wanted them but decided to go with Ronin Warriors since the show was airing at the time. Never knew this show even existed until a few years ago.
TMNT,37e7a2,WorgRider,3,Wed May 27 12:38:14 2015 UTC,I've got the whole set. They are a prized part of my collection. Shredder was a real bitch to get.
TMNT,37e7a2,Delonce,2,Thu May 28 07:00:20 2015 UTC,"Wouldn't it make sense if Splinter, the turtles and Shredder all spoke Japanese normally? I mean, I guess you could make the argument that they picked up English off da streets, but you'd think the turtles would learn from splinter's probably more-than-occasional use of his first language while he raised them. And Shredder obviously shows interest in his Japanese heritage considering his wardrobe. Just a thought lol"
TMNT,37e7a2,soundtraq,1 point,Wed May 27 12:53:17 2015 UTC,"I agree! I actually really liked that the Turtles, Splinter and Shredder were speaking Japanese. :)  The rest of it was batshit crazy though."
TMNT,37e7a2,sea_of_clouds,1 point,Wed May 27 21:47:45 2015 UTC,In a lot of fanfictions they all do speak Japanese on occasion. I think having them speak English is simply because the turtles are an American creation with a primarily English speaking fan base.

TMNT,36ya66,sanjurotsubaki,1 point,Sat May 23 16:15:35 2015 UTC,Your list is making my heart hurt because it is a microcosm of Konami's glory days and that hurts my heart because that reminder only reminds me that the Konami of today is systematically murdering themselves by destroying Kojima and looking to mobile games as the future of gaming. The nostalgia only amplifies the torment of today's situation.

TMNT,36ieen,Pyramidhead97,1 point,Tue May 19 18:57:33 2015 UTC,"I see it in how he's become a lot more reliable and focused on missions than he used to be. Would episode 1 Mikey have been able to save his brothers like he did in ""parasitica?"" We don't have as many moments where Mikey messes something up for everyone. And he has grown as a fighter as well. He didn't do  much in the beginning, but do you remember when he bitch-chucked Shredder in the face during a fight at the docks not too long ago, or how well he fought before he was knocked out in ""the wrath of tiger claw?"""

In fact, all the times he has overreacted it has been both when he was unaware of her state and when the situation wasn't very serious to begin with. For example, Casey losing her in the sewers in ""Fungus Humungous."""
TMNT,36fsq9,Pyramidhead97,2,Tue May 19 01:42:03 2015 UTC,That's a good point. Although he took it pretty well that the love of his life was dying before his eyes. I just feel like the show has become more of a 'monster of the week' type deal and is spending less time in each episode showing each turtle's idiosyncrasies.
TMNT,36fsq9,Pyramidhead97,2,Tue May 19 20:53:23 2015 UTC,"You know, you bring up a good point. Though I think that really is just another subtle character trait of his, because I remember both in the season 1 and 2 finales, when Leonardo ""dies"" (S1) and is almost dead (S2), I couldn't help but notice that Donatello just seemed a little too ""okay"" with the situation. In my mind, I really do think that he makes himself strong in these situations, but he also really does care a lot more than it seems."

TMNT,36c829,metalflygon08,4,Tue May 19 11:36:12 2015 UTC,"Good episode. Better than the last episode, and many others this season.  It had some drama, but kept it subtle and didn't get too annoying with it. Shredder crossing a big line with Karai, and April's dad putting his trust in the turtles (and possibly showing disapproval of Casey?).  It was rather abrupt just casually starting with Karai already cured.  Also abrupt how Leo gets ninja healing now with very little build up, but I like the mystical ninja element here.  It seems to make for good fight scenes too.  Karai's look, with the snake eyes and the occasional hint of scales, is also cool."
TMNT,36c829,Tyrfing42,3,Mon May 18 22:15:04 2015 UTC,"I took me few seconds to get the ""bite marks on Casey's butt"" thing, that was pretty funny. Get it, cause she has snakes for hands!? :D"
TMNT,36c829,purpledrag67,3,Mon May 18 15:46:27 2015 UTC,"Agree with y'all. Definitely an improvement on the last couple in my opinion. But I was surprised that Donny reacted so calmly to April being on the verge of death.  I wonder how often Leo's ninja healing technique is gonna be used in feature episodes. I feel like many shows include similar ""main character learns amazing plot-cure-all for one episode"" things that are never again mentioned or used in the series."

Nickelodeon is starting to release the series with the first two releases due out on June 9th  ( NYC Showdown  and  Search For Splinter )     Beyond that, you are either looking for bootleg releases or hunting down the original releases.  If you go the route of hunting down the original releases, the first three seasons were originally released in small sets of around 5 episodes per disc.  And they were not in order.  (Season 1 and 2 weren't too bad.  Season three skips around a lot.)  Season 1 and 2 were later released in sets with half a season per set.  The Season one sets were fairly common.  But the season two sets are quite rare and expensive.  ($100+ each)  A few of the Season three releases are harder to find as well.  After that it does improve.  Season 4 was released as a set, as was the fifth season, dubbed the Ninja Tribunal, that was dropped in favor of the Fast Forward season.    The fast Forward season was released on two sets with the episodes in order.  Finally the movie, Turtles Forever was released on DVD as well.  There was a final season when the show was relabeled ""Back to the Sewers"" which has not been released on DVD."

TMNT,365mwf,SilentSniper646,28,Sat May 16 11:02:33 2015 UTC,"they were at their best in the 1990 movie, and i'll tell you why.  most incarnations of the turtles make them caricatures, which i dislike. michelangelo is often written as a simpleton who is ""funny"" because he doesn't get the joke. in tmnt1990, mike is funny because he makes the jokes. similarly, the tendency with donatello, especially of late, is to make him a weak nerd. whereas in tmnt1990, his smarts make him basically the funniest of all the turtles. he cracks jokes, he rides a skateboard, and he is above any drama. leonardo is too often written as a stoic downer, but tmnt1990 leo is also occasionally silly. and i don't like raphael as the biggest and best fighter, like they seem to be doing in the 2012 nick show and tmnt2014. i like when they are all equal fighters, and their differences come from their personalities. that way, if your favorite is don or mike, you don't have to feel shame about their inferior physicality or ninja skills.  tmnt1990 is so rich with moments that make the turtles feel like real people, as opposed to exaggerated archetypes. it's a beautiful film that i think may never be topped.  oh, and for what it's worth, i also always loved the 1987 series's sarcastic sassy raph. a rare departure from the typical aggro moody raph"
TMNT,365mwf,terminatah,2,Sat May 16 16:50:06 2015 UTC,"Really? I feel like it's one of the worst incarnations of the brothers. Mickey and Donny barely have personalities, and most of Raph's character is just angst, which is way overplayed in every movie portrayal they've had for him. Donny's only references to his intelligence is that he uses bigger words than the rest, and his one scene with Casey where they're coming up with burns in alphabetical order. For the most part, though, him and Mikey are pretty much absent.   I watched it recently after seeing the latest movie just to compare. Plot is awful in the latest, but I feel like it's done the best with their characters, obviously most notable in the elevator scene."

I want to say Mirage comics but let's be honest, they were only good half of the time... half might be being generous. But when it was good, it was very good.  2003 and 90s movie can tie for third place.   EVERYBODY will have a different answer to this question,  but that's okay.

TMNT,365mwf,ahmedleo414,9,Sat May 16 13:26:59 2015 UTC,I don't think anything tops the Nickelodeon cartoon.
TMNT,365mwf,88episodes,5,Sat May 16 12:33:13 2015 UTC,Agreed. All versions are good but only in the nick cartoon does each turtle have their own look. Not just color swaps with the bandana/skin tone.
TMNT,365mwf,theborbes,3,Sat May 16 13:46:49 2015 UTC,"Although I'd love to see how the Nick turtles would look with the 2003 individual skin tones, too."
TMNT,365mwf,themosquito,-1,Sat May 16 18:19:30 2015 UTC,"Yeah that isn't true at all. 2003 had differences  like this, as did 2007 movie! You could show me them in black and white in either verse and I could tell them apart."
TMNT,365mwf,Winnychan,3,Sat May 16 19:36:10 2015 UTC,"I googled them to see if i was being hasty... The differences are pretty slight. I know it's fun to be snarky on the Internet but if what I said is not 100% true than its at least mostly true. The 2007 version of turtles were pretty close to identical as well. I don't think that takes away from those series at all, but with the nick series the differences are stark."
TMNT,365mwf,theborbes,1 point,Sat May 16 20:21:19 2015 UTC,"Sorry, I wasn't trying to be snarky. I just completely disagree (and that's okay)! They have distinctly different skin tones in 2007, Mike has freckles and blue eyes, Donnie has lovely greyish hazel eyes, Raph's are almost amber, the eye shapes and head shapes are completely different.  I like the 2012 series okay but I find Raph's Harry Potter lightning bolt and Don's gap tooth both annoying visually. It's just personal preference l guess. But if you grew up trying to tell them apart in Mirage, you would find telling them apart in ANY newer version of turtles to be quite a breeze."
TMNT,365mwf,Winnychan,0,Sat May 16 20:43:19 2015 UTC,Really that probably is a matter of opinion- I personally find raph's shell-crack to be cool and that gap-tooth gives donnie the most amazingly adorable smile
TMNT,365mwf,ClumsyVampire,2,Tue May 19 12:59:34 2015 UTC,"Oh it's definitely a matter of opinion, without question!  I fully realize I am in the minority here."
TMNT,365mwf,Winnychan,2,Wed May 20 14:48:33 2015 UTC,"I think the original series of comics from Eastman and Laird has the best ""serious"" version of the turtles.  The current Nickelodeon has the best ""funny"" version of the turtles.  And the 1990 movie has the best blend of the ""serious"" and ""funny.""  Honorable mention to the character interactions in the 2007 movie, and I do like the ""serious"" version of the turtles in the current IDW comics.  Last place: the turtles in the 2014 movie.  Or maybe The Next Mutation live action tv show."
TMNT,365mwf,tower100,2,Sat May 16 21:30:02 2015 UTC,2003 Turtles. Not as super dark and gritty as the Mirage Comics but not as goofy as the 80s or Nick Turtles. A great balance.
TMNT,365mwf,OtakuMecha,1 point,Sat May 16 13:40:50 2015 UTC,Nothing better than 2003
TMNT,365mwf,Animal31,1 point,Sat May 16 13:51:26 2015 UTC,"Personally, none of the tv series have gone where I want the turtles to go. My ideal series would be based off of the Souls Winter comics."
TMNT,365mwf,Rizonknight,3,Sat May 16 14:53:12 2015 UTC,"Huh. Never got what people see in those comics. I LOVE Mirage, don't get me wrong! But when you make the TMNT so beastial, it no longer matters that they are teenage brothers. It obliterates their individual personalities, thus killing the aspect of TMNT that I cherish the most: the normalacy of their brotherly interactions in spite of being sewer dwelling  mutant outcasts."
TMNT,365mwf,Winnychan,1 point,Sat May 16 19:40:42 2015 UTC,"I appreciate that part of the turtles as well, I guess what I'd like to see is a super dark version of the nick or 2k3 turtles."
TMNT,365mwf,Rizonknight,2,Sat May 16 21:43:05 2015 UTC,"Oh, hell yes. I can't tell you how many years I have been waiting for someone to write some content for TMNT that is aimed strictly at the millions of adult fans. Movie, TV show, comic book, novel... I don't give a fuck! Give me katanas sliding into non-robotic ninja bodies.  Give me sais that stab, give me nunchucks crushing skulls! Give me turtles joking openly about sex, or at least the boatloads of sexual frustration they must feel. Give me masturbation and dick jokes. And while we're at it, give Mikey a bong because we all know he's got one.   There is so much that could be explored -- so much that could be AMAZING -- if, just once, they would take a chance and NOT market TMNT to little kids."
TMNT,365mwf,Winnychan,1 point,Sat May 16 23:37:18 2015 UTC,"Did you read Volume 2 of Tales of the TMNT? There's some issues in there that'll touch base on some of those things.   Honestly, if they did Netflix Daredevil but in Turtle suits, that'd be a cool Mirage-based series."

I keep coming back to Grizzly Bear. But I also like the idea of flying, so may an Eagle. Maybe mostly bear attributes with eagle wings...and possibly talons."

TMNT,362m57,DrakonFyre,1 point,Wed May 20 11:44:52 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I wouldn't mutate myself into any kind of animal or anything like that, but I'd experiment with it to see how it reacts to certain things, like cancer or AIDs and go from there.

TMNT,35o1ed,BastardJack,1 point,Tue May 12 15:00:14 2015 UTC,NICE! Years ago my mom called to tell me there was a TMNT arcade machine at a shop near her house (3 hours from me) for a hundred bucks! I drove to get it and arrived to find a Nintendo PlayChoice machine with a tiny TMNT header - apparently they loaded the NES game onto the machine. So disappointing and I kind of hate you for living my dream.

TMNT 2014 is essentially a re-imagining that doesn't (can't) fit into the existing continuity. Look at it like that and the movie's not bad.   My only major gripe - and I'm sure I'm not the only one who feels this way - is there was too much April and not enough of the turtles. Also, Will Arnett's ""Vern"" felt tacked on. He was basically the guy who drove April around, stared at her ass, and had his car blown up."
TMNT,35bbjg,Eurymedion,3,Sat May 9 07:58:55 2015 UTC,"Okay, I really enjoyed the movie. I thought it was fun, but it's not perfect. There are more than a handful of flaws. Michael Bay only produced the film, he did not direct, he did not write it. I understand a produce has some creative control, but not all of it. Don't blame him entirely. Also, the movie is not 2 hours long, I wish. It's only like 1:40 unfortunately."

The biggest thing that bothered me (besides the constant plot holes) was the turtles and shredder's design.  They are all WAY too big.  Shredder isn't supposed to be a guy in a samurai mech suit, he's supposed to be a super awesome ninja!  I have hopes for the next movie, but I'm not holding my breath."
TMNT,35bbjg,ProdigyScar,-3,Fri May 8 18:31:26 2015 UTC,"It's impossible not to blame the insolence of Michael Bay for all the glaring errors, but even more culpable are Laird and Eastman. These guys licensed our collective childhood to Michael Bay's company when it was foreseeable, based on his previous productions, that he would sacrifice the important personal elements of TMNT for vapid, overdone explosive CGI bullshit."
TMNT,35bbjg,llikegiraffes,2,Fri May 8 18:36:46 2015 UTC,"I have been under the impression that Eastman & Laird have been completely out for years. In fact, last year was their first public signing together in 20 years. They aren't very close anymore. From what I thought, Laird is essentially completely out, and Eastman only does IDW comics now. I think it may have been in the contract to say ""created by Eastman & Laird"" at the top of movie covers and stuff as part of their buyout (no source, my assumption).  Source On October 21, 2009, it was announced that cable channel Nickelodeon (a subsidiary of Viacom) had purchased all of Mirage's rights to the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles property. Mirage retains the rights to publish 18 issues a year, though the future involvement of Mirage with the Turtles and the future of Mirage Studios itself is unknown.[4] Nickelodeon has developed a new CGI-animated TMNT television series and partnered with fellow Viacom company Paramount Pictures to bring a new TMNT movie to theaters. The TV show premiered on Nickelodeon on September 29, 2012.[5] The live action film, produced by Platinum Dunes, Nickelodeon Movies and Paramount Pictures, directed by Jonathan Liebesman and produced by Michael Bay, was released on August 8, 2014.[6]  edit: please correct me if I am wrong.

The concept arose from a humorous drawing sketched out by Kevin Eastman during a casual evening of brainstorming with his friend Peter Laird.  Using money from a tax refund together with a loan from Eastman's uncle, the young artists self-published a single issue comic intended to parody four of the most popular comics of the early 1980s: Marvel Comics' Daredevil and New Mutants, Dave Sim's Cerebus, and Frank Miller's Ronin.

TMNT,352wsi,BabyUGotAStewGoin,2,Wed May 6 23:00:08 2015 UTC,"Wait until it's in stock.  Some people who preordered on eBay are well beyond the 45 day window to open a claim, with sellers keeping them on the hook.  It was supposed to ship back in April, and if those early buyers never receive their order, there is no recourse."
TMNT,352wsi,TVsRobLowe,2,Wed May 6 19:42:22 2015 UTC,"They could have got their money back by opening a claim with eBay within that 45 day window and not receiving any item, even on a pre-order. The buyers should have known the risk by allowing the order to stay open past 45 days.  PayPal gives you a 180 day window to open a claim now (which is complete absurdity), so there's a good chance most people paid with PayPal and can get their money back if they want it back."
TMNT,352wsi,IAmTheWalkingDead,2,Thu May 7 05:24:14 2015 UTC,"One issue with that is that eBay removes the record of your sale after 45 days if you don't leave feedback.

TMNT,352wsi,CrookedNinja,2,Wed May 6 20:24:46 2015 UTC,I think it's going to be up to a company like NECA to give adult collectors what they want.
TMNT,352wsi,goluphi,1 point,Thu May 7 15:41:49 2015 UTC,"It's more complex than that.  Playmates doesn't have the relationships with small retailers and may not have the infrastructure to operate as a distributor to sell direct to specialty shops.  They would also have to do it through official channels, getting approvals and paying for licensing, all of which would add to the cost.  And in the end, pieces like this are more a labor of love than an opportunity to make much profit.  So there isn't a lot of incentive for Playmates to take such a risk.    Also remember, Playmates did venture into higher end items with their Cold Cast Statues years ago.  And while they may be highly prized now, at the time they were more or less a failure.  (They barely even got Donatello produced.)  Granted, that was a decade ago and the market for TMNT items is different now.  But I can certainly see why they may not be interested in going down that road again."

I've noticed there's a fairly sizable TMNT-Zombie following on the Internet and it makes me wonder why there isn't an official, serious story arc yet. The turtles have crossed dimensions, traveled back in time, and even fought Eldritch horrors, but why no zombies?  (The New Animated Adventures one-shot and Pizza Face's minions don't count!)"

I didn't jump on buying them all right away when they were cheap. I got most of them for a good price, but that pink ranger was a real pain in the ass to get.

TMNT,34egci,xGhostCat,5,Thu Apr 30 18:39:38 2015 UTC,An actual story about the turtles is what I want. The last movie was more about toe thumbs Mc greasy face and Job from Arrested Development. The story was both convoluted and dumb. Shredder was shoe horned into the movie in a way that makes it clear a 5 year old wrote it. The movie sucked. I'm sorry if you liked it and this offends you but it really sucked. The cartoon has been totally great as has the comic. But Holy shit that turd of a movie franchise.   Dropping in more characters that have been good in the past isn't going to help.
TMNT,34egci,joerdie,5,Thu Apr 30 18:46:44 2015 UTC,"Oroku saki was shoehorned, not the shredder"

TMNT,34egci,joerdie,1 point,Thu Apr 30 19:42:42 2015 UTC,The franchise is as strong as ever. Yes the movie was...disappointing but the Nick reboot has made the turtles hugely popular again.
TMNT,34egci,bionicragdoll,0,Fri May 1 13:40:20 2015 UTC,"I am making the argument that the movie actually hurt the cartoon. Last time I saw sales figures, the action figures were starting to cool. It's still big, and that's great. But it's not as big as it was, and I am making the argument that this was caused by the film."
TMNT,34egci,joerdie,1 point,Fri May 1 13:50:37 2015 UTC,Yeah I got that but I don't agree since they are targeted to two very different audiences. I haven't looked at the sales of toys and such but there could be other factors that you're not taking into consideration. Correlation =/= causation.
TMNT,34egci,xGhostCat,0,Fri May 1 16:21:45 2015 UTC,True. Most of my thought on the subject comes from the opinion of my 8 year old and his friends. I'll read the comic and watch the shows / movies almost no matter what.
TMNT,34egci,joerdie,1 point,Fri May 1 16:44:06 2015 UTC,"Eh?! They are pretty much fixing a lot of the shit from the last film, Actual Ninjas and Oroku saki. Fan backlash fucked up any chance of the first being anygood so Its going to be better than the last one atleast"
TMNT,34egci,xGhostCat,1 point,Thu Apr 30 18:44:08 2015 UTC,"I think the film itself did the damage. The fans just saw that it sucked, and didn't keep quiet about it. And this version is basically dead to me at this point. And I am not alone."
TMNT,34egci,joerdie,1 point,Thu Apr 30 18:48:36 2015 UTC,"They wanted to do something original with their incarnation of the ""shredder"" with an amazing actor.Too many fans bitched about whitewash without knowing the full story behind Eric sachs and it ruined any chance of that part being good. They then rushingly CGID some random Asian dude in and deleted a bunch of scenes explaining Eric sachs was trained by Oroku saki and was his chunin and it fucked up all that side of the plot.  They could of had something original and awesome setting up Oroku saki for Resurrection in the sequel."
TMNT,34egci,xGhostCat,1 point,Thu Apr 30 18:55:58 2015 UTC,"I don't believe that for a second. He wasn't going to be in it at all, they realized it wasn't going to test well, then they shoehorned him in. I assume it happened around the time they decided not to make the turtles aliens."
TMNT,34egci,xGhostCat,1 point,Thu Apr 30 18:59:22 2015 UTC,"Eric sachs had backstory scenes explaining to April that he was raised in Japan and showed her a set of the original shredders armour. Theres a bunch of screenshots of this scene around the net.  And the they never decided to have the turtles AS aliens, They have always had an alien origin since the first incarnation.  A script years ago had them come from another planet but that wasnt for this itteration ""bay"" film, Bay said they were going with the alien origin like every TMNT always has"

But thankfully we are getting that anyway..
TMNT,34egci,joerdie,1 point,Fri May 1 10:41:38 2015 UTC,"It's pretty obvious there was a lot of stuff just missing that could have made it a lot better, like the whole Kappa subplot that was released before the movie and only briefly touched on. I'm really looking forward to the new movie, I think they know what we want now and are trying to deliver.

According to a photo of her I saw from April 2013, she did apparently try to dye it red. But once she started shooting, somebody must have told her to go back to brunette.  So at least she tried. Which is more than most other people did in that production."
TMNT,347ofq,TheImplausibleHulk,1 point,Thu Apr 30 02:43:18 2015 UTC,"Fox's brunette hair did have a reddish tinge, so if that was her doing then good on her."
TMNT,346zlb,Bdizzle420247,2,Tue Apr 28 20:15:36 2015 UTC,I had it but then my ps3 died and I couldn't re download it on my new system because it's no longer available due to konami losing the rights. I hate digital only content.
TMNT,346zlb,JimmyNaNa,3,Tue Apr 28 23:05:26 2015 UTC,I thought it would be in your download history that you could always redownload just not buy new.

TMNT,34673e,CaptConstantine,2,Tue Apr 28 16:53:50 2015 UTC,"Honestly, this is the best part of ninja turtles; picking your turtle and kicking ass with your friends. I grew up doing that on NES and some of my favorite early memories involve playing these games with my friends. Its a tragedy that all the latest games have been 1 player. 4 turtles... 1 player. Ok?"

TMNT,347oct,danny00d,1 point,Tue Apr 28 23:19:45 2015 UTC,"Well this Casey Jones is older... This is like the prologue for a longer film we want te make. A more brutal, adult Ninja Turtle movie.  No longer Teenagers, this is for the fans that grew up and want more realistic feel to it.   But thank you for your comment."
TMNT,347oct,TheImplausibleHulk,1 point,Wed Apr 29 14:47:48 2015 UTC,"Yes of course this is a reflection of the way we see Casey Jones, brutal, and has fun doing it... He's not really living in the same reality. Also proven as he asks the girl out. even I wouldn't go out with him after that. He thinks she should and doesn't seem to have a problem with his actions. A rated R film, wasn't the main reason.  There are a lot of different Turtles, different Shredders and a different Casey Jones. We made him the way we wanted to be. Not necessarily a portait of the comics.   And yes I read the comics they were brutal and I liked it."
TMNT,347oct,bobbyjanniro,1 point,Mon May 4 11:26:03 2015 UTC,"Not a bad concept, but the acting was shit. Needs better blocking and editing."
TMNT,343ht8,vandamage2112,25,Tue Apr 28 00:33:16 2015 UTC,I'm still hopeful for Key and Peele to play Bebop and Rocksteady. That would be hilarious.

TMNT,343ht8,_tylerthedestroyer_,7,Tue Apr 28 16:39:05 2015 UTC,I dont mind this.  I cant wait for a casting announcment for bebop and rocksteady though!

TMNT,343ht8,Dazed-n-Confused,5,Tue Apr 28 03:19:15 2015 UTC,"It wouldn't surprise me if we see the turtles designs softened, shrunk, ever so subtly. Then another step down into normality in the 3rd film.   The problem with the turtle designs is that they wandered WAY too far into the grotesque for the sake of being scientifically/anatomically ""correct."" The ninja turtles as we know them, don't look like turtles. They're friendly-headded, round things with colored bandanas. They should be left that way."

It's pretty obvious that he auditioned for Casey Jones, so it'll be interesting to see if he's cast as anyone else."

TMNT,340yhp,Eurymedion,3,Mon Apr 27 18:14:14 2015 UTC,I think it was cool that Joe eyeball was just an eyeball. And I really dig how much of the original design of muckman was kept. Especially that damn sewer lid stuck to his foot and the gaping whole in his abdomen.

While lighthearted through to about where Ninjara makes her first appearance, the issues before that really laid the groundwork for the darker stories later on.
