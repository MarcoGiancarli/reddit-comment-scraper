kodi,3e4gbx,maxsteel85,3,Tue Jul 21 23:12:26 2015 UTC,I think you would just have to sideload Kodi again. (Maybe someone else can confirm this)

kodi,3e4gbx,HalfandHoff,2,Wed Jul 22 00:49:31 2015 UTC,Use adbfire  - http://www.jocala.com/    Use the Amazon FireTV Utility App - http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=2736774    if you use the adb command line - don't forget the -r to do an upgrade.  http://www.aftvnews.com/how-to-update-an-app-on-the-amazon-fire-tv-or-fire-tv-stick/
kodi,3e4gbx,iamofnohelp,3,Wed Jul 22 03:29:44 2015 UTC,You just sideload the new .apk with a -r switch..  adb install -r .apkSource  Edit: This keeps your current addons and settings. For a clean install just remove the package and then sideload like normal.

Kodi is a ""front end"" for lots and lots of ""back end"" things.   Kodi doesn't really come with much right out of the box. You gotta spend some time setting it up how you want it.   It can be the UI for your media library, all completely legal as long as you own the content and rip it into a digital library.   You can also stream many legal things like TWiT.tv or YouTube.   If you get an hdhomerun tuner and plug it into your network, kodi can be your cable box, totally legally. And if your cable company aren't cockholes you can make kodi the front end for your pvr.   Or you can install all the add-ons that let you watch the illegal stuff. Will you get caught? Eh.... Prolly not. But you can never be sure. You can do things like use a VPN and such if you want to be more sure you don't get caught.

Kodi itself is perfectly legal, but you can point it to other things on the internet using third party add-ons (none of which are included by default) that are made by various people.

I'm at work right now but in an hour or so when I'm home I'll update here and let you know the tricks I've discovered over the years.  EDIT: Alright so the first thing to do is set the filenames as usual (from thetvdb or wherever). An easy way to do this is to name each file in a series as S01E01, S01E02, etc. and then run the files through the renamer: http://www.therenamer.com  For movies, just put each movie in a folder and name both the movie and folder as the name of the movie (imdb and themoviedb have the exact names).  Then, after making sure the directory structure is correct as usual, use Ember Media Manager to download the nfo files and posters/fanart, etc.: http://wiki.embermediamanager.org/index.php?title=Download  After this the files will be the same directories as your media, and can be modified directly if desired. Nfo files can be opened with any notepads application to make changes.  Lastly when scanning/importing the media into Kodi be sure to select local only for the metadata source and it'll use all the info you downloaded and set up."

If something still isn't scraped, create an .nfo file. Plugins, skins, great stuff out there.  However, major customization such as custom playlists as menu entries, a common movie database for all clients on a server and things like that still require a lot of background knowledge. Maybe Kodi will allow this to be configured by a noob someday, maybe not.  It's pretty awesome that these things are possible at all, so I'm not complaining that I lack the knowledge to implement it.

Go to Videos > Files > Add Videos > Browse > Home folder > userdata > Addon_data > plugin.video.NAME OF YOUR ADDON > movies or tv shows (depending on your add-on) > OK > OK > Tell it if your directory contains movies or tv shows > OK   Step 2 only needs to be done once for each path (i.e. In genesis, once for movies, once for TV), afterwards you only need to do step 1 to add a new show/movie to your library The path for part 2 should be the same across devices, hunt around if it isn't - you're looking for the userdata folder. You may have to select show hidden files and directories from Settings > Appearance > File lists. To add your local media, do step 2 but direct it to the folder containing your files after the ""Browse"" step.  Genesis automatically updates the library with new episodes, I don't know about the others.

I'm not sure what do you mean by paying extra to make your IP address static, you can do that from your devices or router using simple configuration that you can google depends on you equipments. Don't misunderstand the dynamic and static IP's from you ISP and the IP's from your local network, read a bit about that.

It is also trivial to add shortcuts to specific parts of addons (i.e. search) on the submenus of the main screen. Integrate addons to the libraries and the shows/movies will be in the main movie/shows sections.   If you're setting up 2 firesticks, use backup to save the first one and to restore onto the second."
kodi,3dv1tg,summitorother,2,Sun Jul 19 22:58:08 2015 UTC,"I think your easiest bet is to use the default skin or something like AEON.  At least with the default you can add shortcuts to plugins like Genesis onto the home screen.  Same for any live TV apps you install.   If there just going to use Genesis you can of course implement there favorites into the actual ""Movies"" and ""TV Shows"" section.  The addon comes with the ability to automatically choose a source or you can choose and show only the best sources but you'll have to experiment with that for yourself.  As far as backups, best thing to do would be to probably use the XBMC Backup addon. If you want help PM and I can gladly put together a video."

I remapped my FireTV remote ""bars"" button (the one to the right of the home key) to show codecinfo during playback, try setting that (kodi wiki has instructions for remapping keys on remotes) so you can look at the Resolution/FramesPerSec/Bitraite of streams. Sometimes it doesn't report the bitrate, but flip around to a few different broadcasters and see if they use different settings, it might help you narrow it down.

kodi,3dma71,Narcoleptic_red,3,Fri Jul 17 14:35:44 2015 UTC,i still think that my raspberry pi is good enough for me :D
kodi,3dma71,techzoneuk,2,Fri Jul 17 20:04:53 2015 UTC,so this thing is terible?
kodi,3dma71,420Loop,5,Fri Jul 17 21:54:57 2015 UTC,Ethernet: 10/100 BASE-T...Nope.
kodi,3dma71,wespitzer,2,Fri Jul 17 16:57:31 2015 UTC,"Because you're streaming videos with a higher bitrate than 100Mbps?  This is a client, not a server."
kodi,3dma71,elmerohueso,0,Fri Jul 17 18:17:09 2015 UTC,"Understood, but I have definitely seen a difference pulling from my server on my Fire TV side loaded with Kodi (10/100BASE-T) and my HTPC with a gig nic card. But since I'm using a MySQL database AND hosting all my 2000+ movie's art on the server the biggest problem I have is access time."
kodi,3dma71,wespitzer,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:29:36 2015 UTC,not a raspberry in a nice looking case?
kodi,3dma71,cdmove,2,Fri Jul 17 14:08:47 2015 UTC,Nope it looks like it has a quad-core 64-bit Allwinner chip.
kodi,3dma71,druuconian,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:34:38 2015 UTC,Raspberry Pi doesn't run Android at the moment does it?
kodi,3dma71,DJ-Snafu,2,Fri Jul 17 14:34:15 2015 UTC,"Wait, why do you need android? Can't you put a stand alone version of Kodi on a Pi?"
kodi,3dma71,illogical_cpt,4,Fri Jul 17 14:58:41 2015 UTC,Yes you can. OpenELEC  & OSMC.
kodi,3dma71,DJ-Snafu,2,Fri Jul 17 15:04:26 2015 UTC,"Oh, sorry, I misunderstood."
kodi,3dma71,illogical_cpt,0,Fri Jul 17 15:08:06 2015 UTC,Have you tried Android on Pi ? I have on the Pi 2. It was a terrible UX. This actually looks promising. Looking forward to running Spotify and other non Chromecast supporting apps
kodi,3dma71,funkdified,4,Fri Jul 17 14:37:43 2015 UTC,"OP may be wrong, but my impression is that the Pi suggestion was for running Kodi specifically, not necessarily Kidi for Android. If so, OP was correct, since the allwinner chipset sucks hard for Kodi video playback."
kodi,3dma71,natethomas,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:42:09 2015 UTC,just backed
kodi,3dma71,ryanholt98,1 point,Fri Jul 17 23:06:03 2015 UTC,I just blew $60.00 on this. Well report back in October 😊
kodi,3dpb7f,ogrehatescomputers,1 point,Sat Jul 18 03:45:42 2015 UTC,Try getting it from a different source
kodi,3dpb7f,illgame,1 point,Sat Jul 18 11:51:35 2015 UTC,Their servers are down at the moment.
kodi,3dpb7f,itsfruity,1 point,Sat Jul 18 13:43:59 2015 UTC,And it's back.
kodi,3dpb7f,usemy,1 point,Sat Jul 18 15:04:10 2015 UTC,what's back?
kodi,3dpb7f,Nethris87,1 point,Sat Jul 18 16:54:13 2015 UTC,Their service
kodi,3dpb7f,NaughtyKielbasa,1 point,Sat Jul 18 20:50:28 2015 UTC,Thanks man. It's working again.
kodi,3dn81b,swo_ope,3,Fri Jul 17 17:19:32 2015 UTC,Also interested in this. It seems like pandora has a custom interface (although terrible in my opinion). It would be nice to have more modern looking apps on kodi.
kodi,3dmf6l,Kodisuperstore,2,Fri Jul 17 13:29:36 2015 UTC,Is this build available to download?
kodi,3dmf6l,nawo69,2,Sat Jul 18 10:08:20 2015 UTC,"Like as a community build on tr? No not as of now, would people be interested?"
kodi,3dmf6l,nawo69,2,Sat Jul 18 13:28:52 2015 UTC,Yeah looks great
kodi,3dmf6l,call1800mixalot,1 point,Sat Jul 18 14:06:17 2015 UTC,"I'm not entirely finished with it. There is no option to add widgets for apps or else I would have program addons and android apps stacked on one another under the ""Programs"" tab, and find a way to add music box, mp3 streams, and spotimc widgets to the music. I was also going to theme the guide to match the ftv colors. Once complete I'll upload a build."
kodi,3dmf6l,jimbocalvo,1 point,Sat Jul 18 15:49:07 2015 UTC,Looks sweet
kodi,3dmf6l,jimbocalvo,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:51:19 2015 UTC,"Been using this skin for a while, really like it, nice and clean. What plugin is used for the ""In theatres"" movie menu? Thanks"
kodi,3dmf6l,NoNamesNoGames,2,Fri Jul 17 15:17:50 2015 UTC,"Follow Joe Rodriguez's video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-zlwy3t8rA&list=WL&index=2 The ""In Theatres"" is done by favoriting it in Genesis and adding it as a widget. Be sure to enable fanart and logos in skin settings for a better look"

kodi,3dkcds,nicgentile,2,Thu Jul 16 23:36:56 2015 UTC,Export the data from Kodi
kodi,3dkcds,kaipee,1 point,Fri Jul 17 00:07:15 2015 UTC,"The first thing I tried. Kodi did an export, but when I searched the HTPC, there were no files."
kodi,3dkcds,msangeld,2,Fri Jul 17 06:11:00 2015 UTC,You don't mention what kind of system you're using at home. On linux you could mount the drive with SSHFS and then use Tiny Media Manager. Not how to mount remote drives on Windows though.
kodi,3dkcds,msangeld,1 point,Fri Jul 17 03:09:49 2015 UTC,"I use Debian as well. Tiny Media Manager, as far as I can tell, does not have a setting that supports SSHFS."
kodi,3dkcds,msangeld,2,Fri Jul 17 06:12:41 2015 UTC,As far as I know you shouldn't need a setting in Tiny Media Manager. You just mount the folder like a local folder and browse it.
kodi,3dj2eo,DanielDC88,3,Thu Jul 16 17:54:02 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure if this applies to OSMC, but on linux in general, you should be able to just use the mount command with no other flags or options to get a list of the current mounts. Your hard drive should be near the bottom of the list and will probably have a block device something like ""/dev/sda1"" and might have the hard drive's partition label as part of the mount point."
kodi,3dj2eo,theblindness,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:17:38 2015 UTC,"Yep, that works. Thanks!"
kodi,3dj2eo,d4nm3d,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:10:26 2015 UTC,what do you mean where are they mounted?  Are you trying to find the location in SSH?  Plus you might find it easier to ask in /r/osmc
kodi,3dj2eo,d4nm3d,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:47:28 2015 UTC,"Yes, I'm trying to SSH to the Pi and browse the media folders there.  Thanks!"
