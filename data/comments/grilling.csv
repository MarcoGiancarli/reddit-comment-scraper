After cooking for 3 hours at 135F, I took it out of the bag and seasoned it with Memphis dust (recipe from amazing ribs.com) that I had added salt and coffee to. It came out awesome! Everyone loved it! Did a hit seat for about 5 minutes on the grill.   Imgur"
grilling,3dokrz,MyName357,8,Fri Jul 17 23:39:24 2015 UTC,There's like 0 marbling on that steak. How did it taste?

grilling,3dokrz,kankles22,2,Sat Jul 18 11:02:13 2015 UTC,"This is what a lot of the steaks look like when they are on sale at my local grocery. For those of us who love this hobby but are on a budget, such is life."
grilling,3dokrz,isprobablyatwork,2,Mon Jul 20 18:12:50 2015 UTC,You must not have a Wegmans. I usually end up getting a bulk pack or going to the butcher and vacuum sealing.

grilling,3dpfb8,XxClover13xX,3,Sat Jul 18 04:26:39 2015 UTC,"I've had an S-330 for about two years now and I go through about a tank per month. I grill almost every day for my wife and I. It had the porcelain grates for a year and I switched to stainless, which I find preheat faster and hold heat longer. You can preheat with two burners, but I recommend three because I like the grates to have consistent heat before anything gets slapped on 'em.   No experience with the S-470. Either way, Weber makes a great product and you'll be satisfied. It's a great investment.   And get the gourmet grilling system with pizza stone insert. Pizza fo' days, my friend."
grilling,3dpfb8,NoodleyDoodle,2,Sat Jul 18 12:20:19 2015 UTC,Very nice!  I definitely want a sear station in whatever I get.  The 3 burner seems like the logical selection for cooking for 2.
grilling,3dpfb8,NoodleyDoodle,1 point,Sat Jul 18 14:54:36 2015 UTC,"Mine doesn't have a sear station :(  Luckily, the 330 with the stainless grates gets to 625F in about 10 minutes. So I guess I can sear. BRINGO!!  Years later, I've also had cookouts with 20+ people and it handled the load nicely. Burgs, chix wyngz, tips, dawgs with room to spare."
grilling,3dpfb8,NinjaCoder,2,Sun Jul 19 12:18:40 2015 UTC,"The 470 has an extra burner, and an IR rotisserie burner (also good for searing steaks if you like that sort of thing). It is also 580 square inches, vs 507 of the 330.  If money is no object, I would get the 470."
grilling,3dpfb8,Geoff_Sanderson,1 point,Sat Jul 18 13:19:58 2015 UTC,That's what's weird the weber site says the 330 actually has more space.  That seems incorrect.  Maybe a mistype?
grilling,3dpfb8,blackleper,2,Sat Jul 18 14:53:07 2015 UTC,"It's possible, the 470 is not as deep as the Genesis S-330. I'd personally go for the Genesis, the S-470 is nearly double the price but you don't get double the grill IMO."

grilling,3dna4w,ess0ess,3,Fri Jul 17 17:34:29 2015 UTC,Best option is to just go with the SS grates made specifically by Weber. I believe they run around $120 but they should last 10+ years easy. Seems like a worthwhile investment to me.
grilling,3dna4w,Redbird274,1 point,Sat Jul 18 03:59:15 2015 UTC,Why the stainless steel instead of the porcelain cast iron?    I ask as a curious owner of a Genesis 330 for a bit over a month.
grilling,3dna4w,ljapa,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:55:15 2015 UTC,They heat up quicker than the cast iron and they last about twice as long.
grilling,3dna4w,Redbird274,2,Tue Jul 21 14:24:24 2015 UTC,"I've got the gourmet system SS grates from Weber. Had them for about a year and they are still just as good as the day I bought them. Worth the money, and get the pizza stone insert while you're at it."
