thinpeoplelove,39s754,xyjames,2,Sun Jun 14 19:09:13 2015 UTC,"No, not really lol It just means my heart beats at a faster pace than normal. A normal heart rate would sit between 50 and 80 beats per minute. Before I was diagnosed and started taking meds for it my resting heart rate was around 120 beats per minute. Now at this very moment on meds my heart is at 75 beats per minute, a huge improvment. According to wikipedia    IST is viewed by most to be a benign condition in the long-term. Symptoms of IST however, may be distracting and warrant treatment. The heart is a strong muscle and typically can sustain the higher-than-normal heart rhythm, though monitoring the condition is generally recommended.   I think the only reason meds are given to people with IST is because, as my doctor described it, ""Your heart has a life bar and the faster your heart beats the faster it runs through said bar"""

Of course you could have a bit less, but your biggest problem is your posture. Your hips are tilted too far forward, which pushes out your stomach and butt and causes lower back pain."
thinpeoplelove,39mpgu,jagabomb09,2,Fri Jun 12 20:50:52 2015 UTC,"Not to put this down, but 3000 calories is like DYEL territory as far as athletic dieting goes"
thinpeoplelove,39mpgu,nfshaw60,1 point,Sat Jun 13 03:14:48 2015 UTC,out of curiosity can you explain what this means?
thinpeoplelove,39mpgu,AtomicCrayola,2,Sun Jun 14 00:36:43 2015 UTC,"Sure, the acronym ""DYEL"" stands for ""do you even lift?"".  This phrase was first used in some random bodybuilding forum and people started using it as a joke for a lot of other things, even outside of lifting itself to call somebody out.  Basically it's used when someone says something that they think is impressive, when in reality it's pretty average.  I used it just to pick fun at 3,000 calories being a lot, because in reality that's on the low end of the spectrum for an athlete.  Like 3,000 calories is maintenance for me, no need to burn anything off.  However, it is very impressive if OP is a girl!   Edit: it also depends on lean body mass, I'm fairly muscular at 6'2 195lbs, if OP is like 160lbs 3000 calories is a lot, pro athletes usually are heavier than that which leads much to higher calorie intakes than 3,000, though."
thinpeoplelove,39mpgu,nfshaw60,2,Sun Jun 14 00:49:08 2015 UTC,Thank you so much for the explanation! I am an active girl who regularly eats 2500-3000 and I was worried I was eating too much but now I realize I'm just fine haha.
thinpeoplelove,39mpgu,AtomicCrayola,2,Sun Jun 14 01:15:26 2015 UTC,"Yup yup everybody is different(to an extent)!  Can't stress that enough, in my opinion one of the best positives to being active is being able to eat a ton and stay lean ha"

You have to have complete self control and be able to use it only in the amounts necessary. While you posses the will power to do that very easily - it does not come as easily to everyone. If someone has an addictive personality and stay away from alcohol because they know they will abuse, it is much more challenging for that person to handle taking something they HAVE to do in moderation. They have just that - an issue with moderation and self control."

If the Reddit admins are willing to fuck over its userbase to get their hands on that sweet, sweet advertising revenue, well here's what we can do.  Let's go after the Reddit sponsors. Write to them, call them out on social media. Make them know of the unhappiness and anger here. Make sure it becomes common knowledge that to advertise on this site is to get your name tainted in a newer ending series of memes and abuse.  If the admins thought that their draconian censorship would make this site more packageable to the corporate sponsors, let's make them think again.

Perry holds dual American-Canadian citizenship.   Perry completed a 28-day program in 1997 for a Vicodin addiction. His weight fluctuated drastically over the next few years and once dropped down to 145 pounds (66 kg). He lost 20 pounds in 2000 because of pancreatitis.  Perry again entered rehab in February 2001 to treat an addiction to opioids (specifically vicodin and methadone), amphetamines and alcohol.    Perry was in Dallas, Texas, filming Serving Sara with Elizabeth Hurley when he had such severe stomach pains that he called a local doctor, who advised rehab. Perry flew to Los Angeles and checked into Marina del Rey's Daniel Freeman Hospital. Perry's publicist Lisa Kasteler confirmed his rehab stay.      Interesting: Matt Perry (rugby union) | Matthew C.
