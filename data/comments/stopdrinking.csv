stopdrinking,3dqoba,notgonnabemydad,1 point,Sun Jul 19 02:22:14 2015 UTC,Great username. I would also be interested in hearing about your experience with SMART.
stopdrinking,3dqoba,TheOtherScottishOgre,3,Sat Jul 18 20:24:59 2015 UTC,"I've only been to SMART once and AA twice, so my impressions are still relatively nascent. AA seems to focus more on admitting to helplessness over alcohol and finding freedom and peace in surrendering willpower to a higher power that provides the strength to quit. You share your story and struggles, but feedback is not encouraged during the meeting, more during one-on-ones with a sponsor. SMART seems to focus on achieving power over the addictive behavior, has no discussion of a higher power, and provides coping tools to handle life without the crutch of substance abuse. They encourage cross talk during the meeting to flesh out ideas, and provide group wisdom and support. It's both good and bad - great conversations ensue but can be dominated by one strong personality. Luckily, there is a facilitator who keeps things moving along. They also provide support for any addiction, not just alcohol. Apparently it's also taught in prison, as there were quite a few ex-convicts there, which really gave me perspective on my choice to quit while I was ahead. I liked the easy comeraderie that seemed to pop up more rapidly than in AA, probably because of all of the group convo.  I've resonated more strongly with SMART thus far. Hope this helps!"

stopdrinking,3drn6r,MenstrualJackson,16,Sat Jul 18 20:10:34 2015 UTC,"Good job on keeping it under control, but I've gotta tell ya--I have seen a TON of these posts (drank, not too much, it taught me that I wasn't missing out on anything) and I'd say that a good 90% of those folks were back to daily drinking within a week or two.   I've also gone through this myself a bunch of times.  Yay, I proved I could quit, now I know that a couple drinks aren't worth it, I won't do it again.  It never ended well for me, either.  One thing it took me a very long time to learn: For me, quitting had nothing to do with willpower.  Willpower was a red herring.  Stay vigilant."
stopdrinking,3drn6r,offtherocks,9,Sat Jul 18 20:34:40 2015 UTC,"I am not drinking today. I know you've heard this 90% of the time. But I honestly do not intend to . I know that I can not moderate just because I was able to yesterday does not in any way represent my pat drinking patterns .. It was a flook . I should have drank at least 2 bottles of wine not to 2 glasses , history dictates this.   Thank you for the advice ."
stopdrinking,3drn6r,bizzygreenthumb,3,Sat Jul 18 21:01:44 2015 UTC,"I kinda agree with you, but I don't necessarily believe willpower is a red herring. Willpower is great, and on its own can motivate you to action, but may or may not fail you in the end without developing discipline. I've disciplined myself to avoid habits, thought processes, and environments that could lead to a failure of willpower to stay sober. That discipline has kept me sober now for almost three years, but without willpower, there's no meaning behind the discipline. Without discipline, there's no force behind the willpower."
stopdrinking,3drn6r,offtherocks,4,Sun Jul 19 08:41:18 2015 UTC,"I think we might have the same opinion.  An example to demonstrate my take:  Ever drive by a guy out there jogging in the freezing rain?  People who don't run drive by that guy and think, Wow, what great willpower that guy must have!  But that's completely wrong. That guy isn't motivated by willpower. Willpower has nothing to do with it.  What's going on is that that guy has developed a running habit.  It would take willpower for him to NOT be out there.  It's been my experience & observation that it takes about 6 weeks to develop a running habit.  In those 6 weeks, you absolutely need willpower to get out there there each day.  You've gotta force yourself.  You do that long enough, and eventually there comes a time when willpower is no longer required.  Which is quite fortunate, because willpower doesn't last forever.  Same thing with the drinking.  It took me great willpower to get through that first month, and I had to use willpower off & on for the next few months too.  But there came a time when I was no longer relying on willpower.   That's not to say that there won't be some days where I might need to use willpower to get through.  Theoretically speaking. On those days, I'll muddle through. But for my day-to-day life, it's just not sometimes that comes up.    Willpower indicates that there's some sort of struggle going it.  It's hard to not drink when you want to drink. Once you lose that desire to drink, it's not a battle at all."

stopdrinking,3drn6r,pretendingtobenormal,7,Mon Jul 20 23:02:18 2015 UTC,"I am going to view this past week as evidence that I CAN abstain if my will power is strong enough.   For me, will power is very finite. It will only be a matter of time before I either decide that I'm not really an alcoholic, or I get a terminal case of the fuck-its. I have to actively apply myself to a program of recovery that addresses all aspects of the insanity that precedes my first drink. Drinking is just a symptom of my disease, not the disease itself."

stopdrinking,3drn6r,soberlifebeckons,5,Sat Jul 18 22:27:53 2015 UTC,"Forgive me. I didn't mean to discourage you. I just know that willpower is a dangerous idea for me, especially long-term. Short-term, it did save my life a few times in the beginning, but my experience was that it can be very fickle and can come and go when it wants. Today, as someone who is trying to cut back on refined sugar, I can say that my experience with it hasn't changed. I truly wish my office had a no-pastry rule."

Just because we survived an experiment with moderation one time, we conclude that we can survive an experiment with moderation every time. And it just ain't so.

It took me a minute to think though the drunk - I had to remember the hangovers, the depression, the shaky hands, the missed days of work, the knowledge that I'm going to drink again and again and again, the humiliation around friends and family, and so much other shit.

I didn't stop until I actually wanted to. If your brother is addicted, I really do not know what you can say to him that will make him see what he's doing. It doesn't sound like he considers this a problem. You can tell him how you feel and let him know that you're worried. But I don't think there are any magic words that will convince him to chill out.  Your parents, and maybe you, could possibly benefit from going to some Al-Anon (/r/alanon) meetings and getting advice from other families of addicts. It sounds to me like your parents are enabling your brother's addiction by shielding him from the consequences of his behavior, and Al-Anon could help them learn how to set some boundaries.   Congratulations on your year of sobriety, by the way. Wish I'd made that decision at 25!"

I agree that my parents enable him and I have tried to talk to them about it. When we were kids I was a troublemaker and was always given tough love, my brother was quiet, kind, and spoiled. Now the roles have reversed and my parents don't really know what to do. They did try to actually punish him before he went to college, but his punishments never really lasted longer than a weekend.  The problem with my brother is that I feel like I can never have a serious conversation with him. He treats a conversation about having to go to court the same as a conversation about what to have for lunch. If I try to talk to him about his behavior he gets extremely evasive. Its like there is a switch in his head where we are good friends and brothers until I try to have a serious conversation with him, then I have turned into parent #3 and am summarily ignored."

It wasn't until I came face-to-face with my own mortality that I was ready and willing to do whatever was necessary to make a change.

Then drunk me would come along and sometimes be a lot of fun, but occasionally would act like a drunken buffoon and ruin the reputation I had worked for myself. They said I needed to pick which me I wanted to be because they were conflicting personalities. It didn't work right away, but did plant the seed.  The issue I see with my brother is that I don't see two people, I only see one. My kind, quiet younger brother died when he was 16 and someone deceitful, manipulative, and with no self control took over. I don't know where I can find the common ground with him."

Quitting drinking isn't like quitting nicotine. It's more than just being irritable and losing a few nights of sleep. People hallucinate, have seizures, and can even die from the withdrawal if their intake was heavy enough and for a long enough time. If I had to give any non-doctor advise, it would be this, taper down. Until you can see a doctor, have no more than 2 standard size drinks (that means no 40oz-ers). And drink them SLOWLY with SMALL sips. If done right, your (inevitable) withdrawal shouldn't be anything major or life threatening. You can expect a loss of appetite, motivation, and sleep for a few days though."

stopdrinking,3ds6y0,RecoveringGrace,2,Sun Jul 19 00:14:06 2015 UTC,"Narcotics withdrawal makes you wish you could die, but you don't.  About the same for speeds.  Sedative withdrawal, and alcohol is a sedative, can kill, and does, often.   Sometimes it kills directly, often indirectly, like by having a seizure at the top of the stairs, or while driving, or in the bathtub/shower and more.   Usually withdrawal is progressive - the first time bad, the second time worse, the third time even more so, etc, etc.  You are playing with lit matches in an oil soaked dynamite factory.  Your business, not mine, but I'd recommend a doctor's evaluation - soon.  FTR: My first known seizure was in the chow line at Clarke AFB Hospital, 1965 - good place to have a seizure   My second known seizure was in a hotel room in San Francisco in 1966 - bad place to have a seizure, not the first or last time it was not my fault that I lived through it.  I say 'known' because some times some people have seizures and for various reasons do not know it. Some have had them in blackouts, others have post seizure memory loss. They just know they're banged up, cut, bruised, cuts/bites on tongue and inside of mouth and have no clue as to what happened.  There are better ways to spend a life."

If I do get sick from withdrawal I'll be on a plane, in an airport, alone in a motel in a strange town, in a meeting, or in a car on a remote road.

I don't feel bad about myself nor do I think I'm super awesome. It's just ""this is average.""  Lately I've been trying to figure out what makes me excited. Traveling, skydiving, or something novel. I also thoroughly enjoy working on projects/common goals with people more than simple conversation. I find I learn more about them as people when I see how they react and deal with different things.  So it's not a dis on anyone. It's more my personality IMO. And I'm inclined to try mind altering drugs because it makes me feel and experience things in such a different manner.  I'd like to find out how I can enjoy talking to people because I enjoy it a lot more when I do drink. So do I have some sort of issues that blunts my emotions and I only let it out when I drink or what?"

Since quitting drinking, I've a new job, in a new town, in a different state. I discovered, to my delight and amazement, that by not spending $800/mo (US) on booze, I could easily afford a new house in this new town, so I bought one. Everything is totally different than it was almost 700 days ago.  The strangest twist, to me, is that I'm okay with that. Reflecting on my mindset of two years ago, my current situation would have been unimaginable. Past me would have literally had a panic-attack at the thought of moving 50-ish miles away, no matter how good the reasons for doing so were. I used to resist change like this with every fiber of my being, now I find myself accepting, even embracing, fundamental shifts in my situation.  Totally agree - it's no minor miracle at all!

The only times I ever really panic and freak out about sobriety is when I think about the future. But I do it again and again, so I totally 100% can relate to what you are going through.   I've told this story a few times, but I keep reminding myself of it because it makes me laugh and not take things so seriously. When I was about 3 weeks sober, I was feeling pretty good about things. I live in Melbourne, and it's a particularly shitty winter this year, and I was thinking about how nice a Thailand holiday would be. Then I just got really, really, really depressed that I won't be able to drink Chang beer in Thailand. Nearly picked up a drink right then and there.  I don't even have a trip to Thailand planned or booked! That's when the whole ""I don't care about tomorrow, I'm not drinking today"" thing started to make sense to me.   Sounds like not drinking and going to bed is the right call. I hope you feel better about things tomorrow."

I have been stuck in that cycle and am trying to come out of it or die trying. I thought a lot about dying and what it would be like to end my life last night, and a drug or alcohol relapse would have lifted me out of that pain temporarily. If I continue to sabotage, I don't have to face the darkness and insanity and faults. However, sometimes it's hard to know if this is just my pattern and others process is entirely different. People talk so much about relapsing and wanting to drink on here, but I'm curious as to why and what's underneath, beyond just the compulsion to get drunk."

stopdrinking,3dq6my,randoker,1 point,Sat Jul 18 14:06:59 2015 UTC,"When you say alcohol will lift you out of that pain temporarily, you could not be more right, because it will give it back sevenfold. Alcohol is a central nervous system depressant; it's basically the worst thing in the world for someone who's chronically depressed. I finally started addressing my usage when I realized that I was basically in a semi-permanent episode between binges due to alcohol, to the point where I was getting the self-harm impulses I thought I left behind years ago.  I haven't had a single depressive episode or anxiety attack since I got sober, and I'm happy almost to the  point of giddiness all the time. Alcohol is the band-aid that quickly falls off; sobriety is the surgery that cuts the poison out. It's a lot harder but it's as permanent as you want it to be (and oddly for a surgery a lot cheaper than the alternative!).

As you say, it can lead to life threatening situations and a very ugly death. I liken it akin to swimming in the ocean, Don't go out to far/deep, Don't get to tired, or swim alone, lest you cramp up, or get caught in a rip tide and that ocean WILL drown you."

I've read countless times about people who want to yell at their own brain for trying to convince them that they're cured. Right now, this is sort of like that. I guess I'm just asking about that revulsion feeling because I know that alcohol literally makes me uneasy to think about. It's like envisioning yourself eating something disgusting. I do get urges for that calming buzz, but alcohol itself disgusts me.  Ive had experience in relapsing with cigarettes in the past. The only time I quit smoking made me feel this very same way. I was absolutely repulsed by cigarettes until I decided to have ""just one"". I ended up having several more after that and getting hooked. So I know what youre saying because Ive been there."

I could drink right now...but I won't.  I'm an alcoholic.  Alcohol ruled my life, and I hated the person I became as I rode that liquid downward spiral.  The day I decide ""I'm fixed now, I couldn't drink even if I wanted to"", I'm pretty sure I'll be drunk that night.    To stay sober, I must keep working on myself.

We will seldom be interested in liquor. If tempted, we recoil from it as from a hot flame. We react sanely and normally, and we will find that this has happened automatically. We will see that our new attitude toward liquor has been given us without any thought or effort on our part. It just comes! That is the miracle of it. We are not fighting it, neither is we avoiding temptation. We feel as though we had been placed in a position of neutrality - safe and protected. We have not even sworn off. Instead, the problem has been removed. It does not exist for us""  For me, this passage doesn't mean I can sit back on my laurels and not work on my recovery anymore.  I know myself, and that doesn't work for me...but in the AA book passage above, it talks about the problem being removed from us after working the 12 steps.

Still extremely vigilant and know I could relapse on alcohol certainly, and I see that's what ur saying as well. I think it might have to do with a sort of allergy to it, beyond just the mental one.

But when I step back I think, it's kind of weird to be so fascinated by whether or not I could bring myself to ingest something, so it probably indicates some lingering maladjustment, so I try not to dwell on it one way or another. I am grateful for any revulsion I do feel, but also the ability to channel it properly.  I remember how much alcohol I forced down while I was still sick and miserable from the night before, and how many drinks I got through while thinking ""I hate this."" Revulsion was not enough for me before. I'm just trying to learn to not drink no matter how I happen to feel about it on any given day."
stopdrinking,3dqtdu,4thBillyGoatGruff,2,Sat Jul 18 17:44:56 2015 UTC,"I think my previous revulsion, while drinking, had to do with withdrawals. If I stopped I couldn't sleep much less stop shaking. I didn't feel it at first, but eventually I lost control of my body. That was it for me. Took me about a week to detox enough to regain control but it took even longer to purge most of the effects that lingered on for months. Now that I'm completely clean that revulsion is directed to the proper source. But I agree, there is something to be said about this fascination we share.

Weekends were never sober; typically, I would drink at least a case of beer over the 3 days. Getting drunk was (and still is, I suppose) my favorite way to pass the time. Last night was the first Friday night since I can remember that I wasn't wasted, and I had no clue what to do.   Everyone that's spoken to me since I came here to publicly claim sobriety has mentioned that over time, it will feel more normal, that you will grow more accustomed to the slow passage of time. One thing I would recommend, and something I am trying personally, is to make a focus of practicing mindfulness. This is something I am hoping will help me re-learn how to be comfortable just... being. I think being drunk, on some level, is the least zen thing you can do; you aren't aware of anything around you, really, you're just reacting to everything happening in your space. Reacting poorly, to boot. Maybe check out /r/Mindfulness this weekend and see if any of the material there resonates with you.  Plus, y'know, there's masturbating."

stopdrinking,3drvkg,Thornkale,3,Sat Jul 18 22:01:55 2015 UTC,"Personally, I kept drinking even when I could see I was harming my relationship, my career, my health, etc. My addiction allowed/encouraged me to ignore those consequences. I didn't stop until I actually wanted to. If your brother is addicted, I really do not know what you can say to him that will make him see what he's doing. It doesn't sound like he considers this a problem. You can tell him how you feel and let him know that you're worried. But I don't think there are any magic words that will convince him to chill out.  Your parents, and maybe you, could possibly benefit from going to some Al-Anon (/r/alanon) meetings and getting advice from other families of addicts. It sounds to me like your parents are enabling your brother's addiction by shielding him from the consequences of his behavior, and Al-Anon could help them learn how to set some boundaries.   Congratulations on your year of sobriety, by the way. Wish I'd made that decision at 25!"
stopdrinking,3drvkg,maple_maureen,1 point,Sat Jul 18 22:11:03 2015 UTC,"Thank you, I will look into the Al-Anon, didn't even know that existed. I agree that my parents enable him and I have tried to talk to them about it. When we were kids I was a troublemaker and was always given tough love, my brother was quiet, kind, and spoiled. Now the roles have reversed and my parents don't really know what to do. They did try to actually punish him before he went to college, but his punishments never really lasted longer than a weekend.  The problem with my brother is that I feel like I can never have a serious conversation with him. He treats a conversation about having to go to court the same as a conversation about what to have for lunch. If I try to talk to him about his behavior he gets extremely evasive. Its like there is a switch in his head where we are good friends and brothers until I try to have a serious conversation with him, then I have turned into parent #3 and am summarily ignored."

Sharing about my experiences and observations about my own life may resonate with someone. I tell them what my life is like now and juxtapose it against what my life was like drinking. I like using specific examples of before and after. Since no one can rationalize with a person who's been drinking I make sure the person I'm talking with is sober. ""I'm here if you ever want help getting sober let me know how I can best support you"" . That phrase seems to work well."

When I was actively drinking and using, I would resist any attempt at help or advice. At first it was all fun, then it was fun with consequences, until finally it was all consequences. It wasn't until I came face-to-face with my own mortality that I was ready and willing to do whatever was necessary to make a change.   What would have gotten through to you when you were at your drinking peak and still having fun with consequences? Perhaps that approach would at least plant a seed in your brother's mind."
stopdrinking,3drvkg,pretendingtobenormal,1 point,Sat Jul 18 22:20:31 2015 UTC,"When I was 22 my roommates had an intervention with me and basically said that there were two me's. I work in a professional setting and was told that sober me had a great reputation and a lot of people liked him. Then drunk me would come along and sometimes be a lot of fun, but occasionally would act like a drunken buffoon and ruin the reputation I had worked for myself. They said I needed to pick which me I wanted to be because they were conflicting personalities. It didn't work right away, but did plant the seed.  The issue I see with my brother is that I don't see two people, I only see one. My kind, quiet younger brother died when he was 16 and someone deceitful, manipulative, and with no self control took over. I don't know where I can find the common ground with him."

O, you should stop that."" He knew it came from a place of concern and a desire to help. But he never listened until one day a recovering alcoholic came to him and said, ""O, I used to do this too, but then I learned a better way.""  So maybe sharing your own experience?

I know I was terrified of telling my family. They were surprisingly supportive. My dad was especially. Most everyone knows someone who has struggled with addiction - your parents probably have friends that have either battled our ""demon"" or former friends that lost to it. Saying you're trying your best and need help isn't an admission of weakness- it's something to be congratulated on. It is, paradoxically, a way of strength. There's that proverb about a cord of 3 not easily broken- and it means that with support, we are stronger.   With my mom, I had to tell her about it from an angle of depression. I've struggled with that before & saying that I was hurting really bad and trying to make a decision to improve my sanity and I needed support was something she could get behind.

I spend time with family now, I try to be kind when I feel angry, I try to be present when I want to isolate. I lean in instead of leaning away. I look for ways to be helpful and as supportive as I can be (now). I admit my faults and live today the way I should have been living before I stopped drinking. At 60 days I was losing my mind, at 6 months my emotions were going crazy. It may take longer or shorter for you, but you will FEEL better... you will feel regret better, feel shame better, feel everything better... including love, happiness, joy, those things will feel better too. It took time to get this way and it will take time to change it.

Two things about this question:  Humans easily reach biased conclusions.  I found that often, much of the room where I was drinking was filled with sober people.  It was just the drunk lens I was looking through that made me think everyone was drinking so much.  Since becoming sober, being in environments where drinking is the main goal, the main reason for being there, are not really that interesting.  Being around drinkers and drinking for the sake of drinking is about as uninteresting as it comes.  The long boring ego filled stories, the very ones I used to be a source of, are slogs to sit through.  The irrational and sometimes dangerous behavior is pointless.  On the other hand, there is a wealth of other activities that I now find more interesting.  So, yes, it's possible to be a sober person in the room.

It's possible to be the only sober person in the room but I usually don't try. It's possible to be in a room full of people who are sober, or at least not drinking to the point of stupidity, but it might require seeking out new places to go.   Quitting did raise my anxiety in social situations initially. It was worth it. I'm getting better now. But none of this mattered for me in the earliest days. Getting to bed sober, today, is guaranteed to leave you feeling better tomorrow than drinking would. It's this sort of incremental physical and mental improvement that allowed many of us to learn how to revisit issues like how to socialize. If I had kept drinking the way I was I would have ended up with no friends anyway eventually, so this version is a lot easier in that sense."

And, yeah, working with other alcoholics and addicts... man, it's not bullshit what they say. It really has helped me more than anything else.   I remember doing a 12 step call on a frequent-flyer (in, out, in, out) at our club when I had around two months of sobriety. The conversation was going really well until he drunkenly fell down and hit his head, then stood up and completely forgot who we were and why we were in his house.

When I could no longer produce, I was no longer in demand. Like a 25 year old teenage pop star, I had outlived my usefulness. I still ""networked"" like crazy. Why wasn't I getting any more job offers? (Hint: because I was a drunken mess).  Then I met a VP of a large oil company who filled me in on a secret. He had never lost a business deal because of his sobriety. People who want to do business will still do business.

When I've encountered them, I have always found out (eventually!) that their behavior is due to insecurities, self loathing or other issues that have nothing to do with me.  It's hard to feel sorry for them and even harder to want to help such people when all you get back is negativity, but I think that is what can make the whole situation better.

I'm new at this quiting drinking thing, but I quite smoking a couple of years back and it turned out everything for me was a trigger. It took two full years to unlearn.   One of the things I noticed was that the seasons changing was enough to make the learned behavior to come back again.  I used to smoke after work before I got in my car. The first few weeks I quit was during the summer. It was tough going past where I used to stand and smoke, but after a couple of weeks I got over it. But when the seasons changed it was like my body was saying ""well I know we don't smoke here when it sunny and 80 degrees anymore, but  now that it's autumn and 40 degrees. It's fair game again."""

stopdrinking,3dpgyt,offtherocks,2,Sat Jul 18 18:27:39 2015 UTC,"I gotcha.    Well, I think the important part here is that other people can't understand how alcohol makes you feel.  If I had one drink today, I would crave another drink for weeks afterwards.  I suppose you could liken this to credit card use.  Maybe you're spending money freely all the time, always buying on credit. When you tell a friend that you have to cut back on spending to save money, they might respond with, What are you talking about?  You always have money! That person sees only what's on the surface. They don't understand what's going on under the hood.  They don't have all of the information.  And, with something like drinking, they can't have all of the information.  That is, unless they also once had the same problem themselves."

stopdrinking,3dpgyt,FlautasDeNada,2,Sat Jul 18 04:44:48 2015 UTC,"did anyone else at some point feel failure is inevitable?   I'm not sure what you mean by this question, so I'll answer a more general question that might be relevant: I felt, as things got worse, that I was chasing failure. I would have described myself as ""high-functioning"" as would most people around me--I built a respected, profitable business with 50 people depending on me for their family's income, health care, and immediate future.   I was chasing failure because I had no idea how long I could keep the balls juggling. And for some reason I kept juggling as I waited for sobriety to show up and force itself upon me.   It never did. And the wheels on my high-functioning life didn't fall off, and I never did get the relief and unequivocal sign that it was over. No big crash for me, no DUI, no hospital or rehab.  Mine was kind of a slow crash, parts falling off, marriage slowly circling the drain and failing, kids starting to doubt me, health deteriorating, mental state more persistently depressed, and just holding on. Juggling and functioning. I was still waiting.   Finally the pain got bad enough that, somehow, I realized that the sign to stop drinking was not going to appear written in the sky for me. I was going to have to decide, and do it not tomorrow, but today. I remember when I took the step of seeking out an addiction counselor. That for me was the step. It led to many other steps, but it was the first one. That's when I decided that failure with a capital F was not inevitable, not for me, and what's more I didn't want failure.   The badge and resetting. That's not failure, if it happens, as long as it's a step. What happened, what should I do differently? That's what the badge reset was for me. That said, I had uncertainty about how long I could do it--maybe that's what you mean--and I managed to counteract that uncertainty by focusing on what I could manage: what I do today. In the early days of not drinking, that's what to focus on in my opinion--not next week or next month or does this mean forever. That's absolutely not relevant until you've dealt with today.   Sorry for the long rambly. Got me thinking."
stopdrinking,3dpgyt,Slipacre,2,Sat Jul 18 07:24:48 2015 UTC,"I still havent told evryone. One buddy was like dude just take a break but honestly im sick of it.  Failure is when you stop trying. I stop trying when im pounding beers. Failure happens, its ok. Sure i dont want to slip. Detoxing sucked. I dont want to go through that again. I focus on right now, this moment, this day.  Glad you're here."

You do not need be in situations where you have to explain, ""got other plans"" is all you need to say"
stopdrinking,3dpgyt,NonnyMouse69,1 point,Sat Jul 18 11:33:11 2015 UTC,"I thought I was fooling people with the amount I drank, but I was only fooling myself. There were many, many sighs of relief when I finally got sober.  And honestly, to hell with what other people think. Your sobriety and the reasons behind it are yours to own; you don't owe anybody an explanation or excuse. People judged me when I was drinking; why do I care if they judge me when I'm not drinking?"
stopdrinking,3dpa73,thehoneybeetle,3,Sat Jul 18 03:35:30 2015 UTC,"I wanted to check this out but couldn't ""find"" a copy.  Generally speaking, I've long thought that drives to alter public perception do far more harm than good.  I think it will drive people AWAY from getting help, not draw them in.  People want to stop drinking.  They don't want to join a cause.  Imagine the issue was herpes.  If people thought they'd be pressured to join a herpes awareness movement, they wouldn't seek treatment.  Treatment, there's another interesting word.  A group like AA can be a treatment group or they can be a public relations group. There is no room for overlap, at least not in any sane person's mind.  Medical treatment is independent of political causes.  People don't go to Susan G Komen to receive medical treatment.  And the local oncology department doesn't get mixed up in trying to sway public opinion. If the people in AA want AA to continue to be seen as a treatment group, they need to steer clear of activism.  We get our fair share of activists here.  You can spot em because they make politically charged statements like, you have the disease of alcoholism.  There is no reason for making that statement unless you're trying to promote an agenda.  Hey friend, I have the disease of cancer.  No one says that.  I don't see how anyone genuinely committed to AA principles can get involved in this sort of activism.  This is, at its core, a belief that if other people do X, their own life will be easier.  I'm stigmatized and that's not right so other people should fix that problem for me.  It's exactly what AA deliberately isn't about.  I really don't think there's any stigma at all about not drinking or being a non-drinking alcoholic.  Active drunks, sure.  I've never seen any stigma at any workplace about people who didn't drink.  Ever.  It exists almost entirely in the addict's head. A public awareness campaign can't fix a problem that only exists in fairy tales."
stopdrinking,3dpa73,offtherocks,3,Sat Jul 18 06:41:41 2015 UTC,"Definitely agree with what you've said here.  Tradition 10 in AA says, ‚ÄúAlcoholics Anonymous has no opinion on outside issues; hence the A.A. name ought never be drawn into public controversy.""

It was really cool. I personally have never been much for anonymity, I figure if someone is going to have a problem with me being an alcoholic then f em! I do like the idea of stamping out the stigma. ""Alcoholism"" is such a loaded term and ""alcoholic"" even more so.  Disclaimer, I still don't shout it from the rooftops and I waited until a little over a year before I started ""coming clean"" to more and more people with the logic being if I make all these bold statements...then relapse...what does that say about AA and about me?  Those are my thoughts."
stopdrinking,3dpa73,Thornkale,3,Sat Jul 18 03:56:56 2015 UTC,"It was an okay movie but I felt they confused the issue of anonymity. You aren't required to stay anonymous in AA, the anonymity means you can't go telling people who you saw in a meeting. Coming out in public about your recovery is a whole other thing. I definitely agree that it's important to share my story outside of AA, so there is less stigma attached with alcoholism. I stalled on quitting for many years because I didn't know anyone else in recovery. Had I known, I may have got sober sooner. I want to be someone people who are struggling can come to for support. So this aspect of the documentary was really good."

Your health matters and it's ok for you to guard it carefully. You don't owe anyone a night out at a bar. If their loved one were miserable in their alcoholism to the point that they couldn't even hang out at a bar with them if they wanted to, that would be a hell of a damper on their plans.

The irritability might be a lot of things, and with a little distance from the deal with your friend, it will likely become more clear.

I've been reading Alan Carr's The Easy Way to Stop Drinking, and it's been helpful, but his whole ""don't stop drinking while you're reading this/ don't read this while drunk"" has been a bit of a catch-22, so it's been slow going.

stopdrinking,3doxpq,Aarmed,6,Sat Jul 18 01:37:21 2015 UTC,"Relapse is all about intent for me. For example, I went out for my birthday a few years ago and got a delicious desert. I LOVED the sauce. It made me feel...funny. When I asked our waitress she advised me their was alcohol in the sauce, despite me specifically asking if their was before ordering it. I don't count that as a relapse. If I had picked up the wrong glass, sipped it, realized what it was and continued to drink it is a relapse.  Sobriety for me is a state of mind, so I don't get too caught up in the semantics of accidental ingestion. Intent is all that matters."

I am currently trying to sort out some family issues that I won't bore you with but it is one of those three sides to a story problems, with the other side being from the perspective of selfish unreasonable active alcoholics. I had a past history of 30 years of heavy drinking with them and also ignoring and deferring the festering issues. As I stayed sober I bit my tongue harder and harder, trying to maintain a sense of humor, and generally deferring to their wishes to make peace. After all it was me that changed.(I am no fun since I quit drinking is their spin, I tend to disagree.) This week I lost my shit, blew up and threw a pile of pent up anger and issues on the table under a spotlight.   Now that this stuff has to be dealt with almost immediately my mind has drifted several times to wouldn't it just be easier to get drunk like we used to and it would all work out. Well obviously not, and I am not going to drink, especially as a reaction to a drunk. That said the desire to just run away is still in a small part of my ol drunk brain, and I have to keep on top of it.  Anyway, a bit of a ramble and I used your thread to vent a bit.

I don't drink, but nobody notices/cares. The biggest thing about sobriety is that you and someone who is not an alcoholic wake up feeling exactly the same. They can drink in moderation, they wake up feeling great. You can't, so you stay sober, you wake up feeling great. I still go out with friends, I'm still a loud, dumb, off-key singing, poorly dancing dummy that enjoys parties and wedding, and on top of that, I'm a cheap date!!

I haven't gone through the steps but I find this sub to be pretty amazing and it was pivotal in me making it through my first week.  It also helped me face the fact that I really did have a problem but that it was okay and there were things I could do about it. Seeing my own experience reflected in the posts of others has been a huge help during this time, and lending my support where I can makes me feel good too, like I am taking something useful and passing it on.  Ah, the warm fuzzies."

Also, anytime you change your life priorities, you risk drifting away from your current friends. At 48, I can also say that most of my friends in life have been temporary.

stopdrinking,3dnrgz,FlautasDeNada,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:55:16 2015 UTC,"What do you journal? I'm feeling very hopeless and I don't know how to begin talking to anyone in person about becoming sober, so I'm giving this online anonymity a shot as my first step.   I've mentioned it to a friend who calls himself an alcoholic, yet continues to drink with certain rules (will never drink during the day, will not drink alone) so he is a very social butterfly. When I told him I had been 4 days without a drink, I got a ""meh,"" as in ""I'm not on the same page as you.   I just want to be happy and I know drinking makes that near impossible apart from surface value. I'm having a very hard time being happy while sober. :(  Thank you for your suggestions"
stopdrinking,3dnrgz,FlautasDeNada,2,Fri Jul 17 20:06:27 2015 UTC,"Good question.  One of my goals is to stop my knee jerk reaction drinking. The key is to develop new thinking and coping mechanisms. I try and read, write, talk and listen to fill my head with the reasons why I am stopping all consumption of alcohol. The more vehicles to deliver this message to my subconscious mind the better.  So maybe start writing about why you want to stop. Analyze any losses, the costs of drinking, the ultimate silliness of this self-destructive behavior.  Try and calculate the long term costs: money, health, relationships, reputation, career, productivity etc.   Next, study those who have been successful in sobriety. I have a pantheon of sober heroes and dare i say even gods!? Yes! Write it down. Grind it into your head!  Next, journalize about your plan. Have you looked up AA or Smart meetings? I have found that just by pounding unsweetened mineral water i can head off most cravings. I am avoiding clubs, bars, parties and spending too much time with my drinking buddies. Anticipate and work through scenarios.  Next, write about what are your goals, dreams, wishes etc?  Next, write about failures. Why did i write out my full legal name (25 letters baby!) in urine on that guys cinder block wall?!  Next, write about successes.  I hope i am successfully conveying my belief that where the mind goes, the body follows.   Here are some examples:  Serious: If youre sober right now  Funny  Ones with the word fuck  Inspirational  Trigger short circuiting  I comment and quote on inspirational nuggets  And I've probably gone too far, however, one last one. u/bbcwfan writes some good stuff that slaps sense into the deepest reaches of my brain! So I shamelessly thank him (or her!?)  Dear Alcohol  I hope my rationale is clear. And I hope these writing examples help inspire you.   Edit  Too long so lots of trimming and tweaking."

Assuming you are close to average you have a basal calories count of ~1800.  Therefore you would have to eat nothing and also actively burn 790 calories/day.  If you ate anything at  all you would have to burn that too.  So how did you do it? Crazy diet on top of tons of exercise?  The average person burns ~ 100 calories while running one mile.

My wife was watching this from on demand: http://realitytvmagazine.sheknows.com/2015/05/26/extreme-weight-loss-recap-an-unbreakable-twin-bond/ So I decided to try to duplicate their results since I'm about the same size.   1) 385 2) 379.5 3) 382.5 4) 377.8 5) 375.8 6) 376.6 7) 374 8) 374.6 9) 375.5 10) 374 11) 371.6 12) 373 13) 371.8 14) 372.4 15) 369.8 16) 373.2 17) 373.5 18) 374 19) 371 20) 368.8 21) 367.8 22) 365.8 23) 367.2 24) 364.6 25) 364.6 26) 363.8 27) 364.2 28) 363.5 29) 363.1 30) 362.8   My food for the day typically consists of a egg and piece of dry toast for breakfast, turkey sandwich/mixed greens/mustard on wholewheat for lunch, skinless chicken w/ mixed veg. for dinner, snacks air popped popcorn w/ indian spice mix (no butter obv), hot and spicy pickles. My exercise started with waddling one mile in morning and one mile at night.  I added a little distance every time I walked.  I'm now at a total of around 3.5 miles a day."

My advice is to have a serious talk with your SO. Two thoughts: First, it seems she doesn't understand what you're up against and what you're trying hard to do, and for that reason is not a good source of support for you. It would help you if she, at least, was not a source of risk for you, and perhaps you can have that conversation with her.  Second, and related, it's nobody's place to decide whether it's OK for you to drink. It sounds like you know this and came through with flying colors, but something rubbed me a little raw in her giving you permission. It will always be your decision.   But--particularly good job of you thinking this through in the moment. I found that having a plan what I would drink at some event before I got there made it easier to not have to make that decision in the moment. For example, if I was going to a eatery I'd decide I'm gonna have a sparkly water with a lime--before I walk into the place. Then I wouldn't have to decide what I wanted to drink when I was standing there looking at the taps."

Don't spend one second beating yourself up over a perfectly natural (and quite frankly, expected) slip up. Almost all addicts have at least one slip up. The important thing is that you're still here, you're being honest about your slip up, and you recognize your mistakes. Try to make something constructive out of it. Get out a pen and a piece of paper (or open up a word processor) and put into writing the events leading up to your slip up. Try to identify what triggered the craving, what your internal dialogue was like when you were deciding whether or not to have that beer. Write down how you felt when you decided to have the drink(s), write down how it felt to take those drinks, then write down how you feel now. You can use this experience to make the chances of a repeat that much less."

If you are interested in working some steps, I would recommend pulling up your local AA meeting directory online, and checking some meetings out.  Be patient and try several meetings, so you can find the meetings and people you like.  It took me a while to find young, energetic, inspiring meetings, as there were many depressing, older, sad meetings with a lot of bitching and complaining, and not a lot of the solution, and joy of a new sober life.  I too had to reconcile my issues with religion to find a spiritual life that worked for me.  Fundamentally AA is completely hands off, encouraging some higher power of your understanding, whatever that means to you, so there is a lot of freedom in that.  Sounds like you are ready for a big lifestyle change.  I found that through regular AA meetings, getting a sponsor, getting inspiring sober friends, and taking up a regular exercise program.  Like finding good meetings, that might mean finding a good, inspiring gym where you can become part of a community.

I've been sober six months now and something just clicked within me recently where a lot of that anxiety has gone away. I still have some, but it's much less now. I can't say it'll be exactly the same for you but I think given time (and maybe just more practice), it'll get better for you too.   Good luck and grays on staying sober!"

I've been there enough times to know not to bother trying to talk you out of it or cheer you up - you'll get there when you get there. But I do want you to know that the only thing drinking will do at this point is make a fucked up situation even more fucked up.  The point of not drinking is that you get to have a life. It's going to be your responsibility and your privilege to make that life, and if you're grateful for it, you'll do great. If you take the other road, I'm sure you know where that heads.

What I had to do was force myself to become more active. For instance, I like visiting local speedways. It can be really difficult to find somebody to join me. Not many of my friends enjoy racing, and the beer sort of made it bearable for them. Now that I don't drink, people don't seem as interested. Anyway, I now FORCE myself to go out. When I come up with a plan to do something, I commit to going no matter who is or isn't going. It's so easy to sit on the couch and sulk; that's when these feelings of hopelessness set in for me. For me, increased activity (in any form) keeps these thoughts away. The activity stimulates my brain, and once I get the ball rolling it's easier to keep it rolling. I'd suggest forcing yourself to do something you enjoy tomorrow, no matter how futile you belive the effort is. If you're anything like me, it might take some deep thought to remember what you liked doing before alcohol, but you've got this! Stay strong!"

For awhile that worked for me and I told people that is what I used.  Everyone was very glad that I stopped resisting and using something that worked for me.

stopdrinking,3di59e,the_pissed_off_goose,1 point,Fri Jul 17 05:55:06 2015 UTC,"I think of the higher power as more of a concept than an entity. I'm pretty open to the idea of a collective unconscious that is brought to consciousness through relational means--human beings working together to uncover mysteries of the universe. This kinda fits in with the 'group' as a higher power, but I look at the foundation of that and it's really the process of relationship building and mental and emotional growth that are indicative of a 'higher power' for me.  Most things are powers greater than myself, and when I relinquish the idea that I have ultimate control of everything around me, I feel more at peace with myself and my actions in the world are more of a benefit to others and my state of being than a burden. Once I 'let go' of fighting the higher power idea and let myself sink into sober thoughts, I found a sense of spirituality that is right for me. I found it in language and the relationships with others, which, ironically, is difficult for me to detail in more words. I figure, you need at least two people to make a language, (based on comparisons and agreements in signs/symbols), so there's a power greater than myself in what is created via communication between the self, others, and the 'higher self', or thoughts and feelings you 'can't quite describe' through language.   I think the AA text is REALLY open to interpretation and is very malleable to any belief system. I actually haven't been to AA since I've been sober this time around, but still found myself inside a spiritual quest I'd never thought I'd find myself in."

I think it would be helpful to stop thinking about 'a whole two day weekend' or ' a nine day vacation' and think about a series of individual days, or even sections of time. So you can say to yourself, I'm not going to drink today or, even, this evening.  Maybe coming up with a plan would be good too. Structure your days to avoid the triggers that usually start you drinking. If you're not going away, could you arrange to see someone (supportive) every day?"

I'm going to tell you a story, that sounds completely unrelated, but stick with me. In the lead up to turning 30, I was like ""my life is fucked, I need to fix it"", and the most obvious thing to fix first was my drinking. So I saw a doctor, re-read the Allan Carr book, started spamming SD constantly, etc.   3 weeks in, I hit my birthday. My 30th birthday. A pretty big freaking milestone. It was hard, but I didn't drink. I am so proud about myself for that.  Now whenever I consider relapsing, I can say to myself ""If I didn't relapse on my 30th birthday, is today the day I'm going to throw it all away?""   I think that going on a vacation in early sobriety can potentially be amazing for you. If/when you get through it, you'll have a huge accomplishment, and then when you have a day when you are thinking of throwing it all away you can potentially have a similar thought process.   Best of luck, and enjoy your vacation, /u/MadMadHatter!"

I'm not making excuses, but I think the worst part of my problem is I am a highly functional alcoholic.

I have a job, a roof, food on the table, but every night and every day and night in the weekend it was the same. Somehow I've eluded hitting some sort of rock bottom all my life and I think that's what's hurt me the most. Well, I'm determined to stop this now.

A lot of people justify their drinking by saying, ""I'm a good person, I don't drive after drinking, so what's the big deal?""  I know I did that for years.  ""I'm not hurting anyone, so what's the problem?""  People spend years telling themselves that, so it is probably hard to break out of that style of thinking.  You see your own addiction as not-a-problem, but when it starts to become a problem, to keep the fallacy alive you have to start putting others down.  Running these thoughts by other people by posting them here is such a valuable exercise.  An outside perspective, particularly from a person who's been there, is priceless."

stopdrinking,3di279,coolcrosby,9,Thu Jul 16 13:26:22 2015 UTC,"To me it sounds like a reason to switch. It doesn't sound like a former womanizer, it seems like he's still active in that defect. He probably finds this girl attractive, and is trying to make sure you don't get involved. It doesn't sound like he's protecting you at all. If he was protecting you he would talk about your sobriety and how it can be effected by a new relationship this early on. And he would leave it at that."
stopdrinking,3di279,debtsetradio,6,Thu Jul 16 13:48:37 2015 UTC,"Hello. I just want to say that if the sponsor made you feel weird, look for another. It's not anyone's business about her friend and okay I get that he's ""looking out for you"" but be weary of the man who gossips. I had a friend in AA who was very pretty. My sponsor told me don't drink and don't get her drunk, but he never told me not to associate with her. To me that is going a bit far. So I will tell you what he told me. Don't drink. Be safe. They recommend not starting any new relationship until you have one year, but that's a suggestion only. it is okay to have friends. The girl is obviously interested, that's fine if you are too. It's looked down upon when men pursue the women who are new. My only caution to you is that a sponsor who gossips about the women will gossip about other men too. My logic is that said girl is probably nice. We are all there for one purpose... The desire to stop drinking and learn how to live without drinking. Peace and good vibes."

stopdrinking,3di279,JillybeanTX,3,Thu Jul 16 16:39:58 2015 UTC,"The thing that sticks out to me is why is this guy talking about her friend having herpes.  As someone who has herpes that is way out of bounds to me and there seems to be an ulterior motive.  There is no need to talk about someone else's sexual health unless you have an agenda.  To me the only reason someone would mention something like that is to attempt to repulse you, which is the common response, and also as a control mechanism in my opinion.  I've had people attempt to do this to me because they didn't like who I was talking to.  Even if her friend or herself had herpes that doesn't mean they are a bad person, check the CDC on herpes rates, I bet you will find it is more common than you think.  It sounds like your sponsor needs to educate himself.    The call after midnight also a little weird but some people are night owls.  I think you are on the right path with focusing on your sobriety and only that and I think a great response to the situation is what /u/JillybeanTX stated."
stopdrinking,3di279,FadedBlaze,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:43:00 2015 UTC,"I completely agree... the gossip thing gave me pause as well.   HOWEVER... if it was true - I might be upset if my Sponsor knew and didn't tell me! LOL  Because typically - what my Sponsor and I discussed STAYED between her and I.   This one is tricky because honestly, I don't have enough information.  If one of my Sponsors told me something - and I loved, adored and trusted her, I'd listen.  But that is because I had AMAZING Sponsors.    Of the 3 main ones I had in the past 20 years, I am still in touch with 2 of them - and the 3rd one passed away some years ago.  (once an angel, always an angel with THAT one.)   So there are a lot of unknowns here.  (Sponsor credibility, intent and agenda - IF ANY - and I have no way of knowing that from this post.)   Has a Sponsor called me at midnight to 'gossip'? NO.   Has a Sponsor warned me about certain men in the rooms? YES   I even recall once... my first Sponsor warned me - gently - when I had 2 years sober and met a man I wanted to date.    She said to me 'carefully':  ""Just remember we don't know much about him yet.""   He has just moved to Arizona and claimed he had 7 years sober (he didn't.  Later he admitted to me he had lied about his length of Sobriety.)   I went ahead and dated him... 3 months later we were both a mess! LOL   So... I am really on the fence with this because I can see it going many ways!"

I've felt like a walking zombie ever since my wife left and I have even contemplated ending things if my kids weren't in my life.  I was drinking almost every night until blacking out, and since I've started the steps with him things have changed.  I don't want to risk screwing this up because if I drink again I might not be able to come back from this."

I feel like if I told him I'm not pursuing her or whatever we can just drop it there, no need to continue calling to tell me that her friend has herpes and all this stuff.  I don't know what to do because This is the longest I've been truly sober without Antabuse.

I would just try to tell him as firmly, but kindly as possible,   ""Hey...  I appreciate your concern but can we table the discussions about this girl because it's kind of weirding me out.  Especially with the late night after-midnight calls.   For now, I just really want to focus on my Sobriety and steps.""

stopdrinking,3di279,JillybeanTX,3,Thu Jul 16 16:15:34 2015 UTC,"My response was based on two things he indicated:   We were compatible in everything until this. He spends a lot of time on me and I appreciate how he goes out of his way to call and meet with me   and    I'm just really needing as few changes as possible.   As someone that has sponsored others... I suspect I have gotten weird a few times too.   Most of us really care and do the best we can!  Is he (the Sponsor) out of bounds?  Kinda sounds that way to me.   Does it have to be a dealbreaker?  Maybe.  Maybe not.   Therefore... if the OP so desires, one phone call to the Sponsor and they all move on.   OR... MAYBE... JUST MAYBE - the Sponsor is acting out a little on some of his own sh*t.  OMG!  That CAN happen.  If the OP hadn't strongly indicated he really wanted the Sponsor-Sponsee thing to work out, I may have replied differently.   But since he said he really just wanted the weirdness to stop...  honestly - it is possible with some direct communication, everything may just be fine.    I know it's hard to believe - but EVEN SPONSORS  - try too hard.  They mess up.  They try but fail.  They have great intentions but overstep.   shrugs   I have been 'fired'. I am also still in touch with my most of my Sponsees. One of them just picked up her 15 year chip.    I think we did well together because we never demanded perfection from each other.  We just tried our best to walk that road of Sobriety together and hope we were doing the best we can. ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•"

It won't come immediately. There's nothing wrong with skipping out on a drinking event and spending some time by yourself. I had missed out on so much personal development while drunk that I was desperate for the space to think.  I decided I'd rather be socially awkward for the rest of my life than miserably dependent on alcohol. I still feel that way, but as time passes sober socialization becomes easier, so it's not going to be a trade-off after all. It turns out that alcohol was only providing me with the illusion of sociability. Sometimes without alcohol a bad mood, or an embarrassing faux pas, or an awkward situation can make a social situation a little difficult and I have to learn how to deal with all those things. There isn't a magic button to turn everything fake fun anymore and that's hard. But on the bright side, I don't wake up with no recollection of whatever humiliation is causing my loved ones to resent me. Some social skills those were...  I wish you strength in your choices; there is a lot of good support to be found here, especially when your friends in person aren't understanding of your situation."

stopdrinking,3di08e,Ihearcolor,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:51:02 2015 UTC,"I stopped for 3 days and noticed I go to bed lonely and thinking about death. Usually that's scary and feels bad. But I feel the trade off is worth the results. I've been looking to get rid of a pot gut and meet women (sober). Three days and my gut has receded a bit already. I know it's sugar that gives me a pot gut, and I know it's sugar especially from alcohol.  Now when I go to bed lonely and thinking about death I think, ""Well, this might feel bad but these are the necessary feelings that will help me lose this pot gut and find a girlfriend.""  A lot of people on this sub say they drank because they were/are alcoholics and they'd find any excuse to drink, eg, ""It's Thursday and 30 minutes to lunch! Time for a drink!"" But for me I know I have specific triggers that drive me to drink. Bedtime approaching, feeling lonely, and thinking about death always made me grab a couple of drinks to buzz-out before falling sleep. The way my brain wired it was, ""Are you kidding? Of course you're having a drink, otherwise you're going to trip the fuck out."" So now I see it as my brain shit testing me and thoughts of being lonely or thoughts of death that come up are like a false punishment for not drinking. All I have to do is be willing to confront those thoughts."
stopdrinking,3di08e,ShitfacedBatman,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:41:13 2015 UTC,"That's it, stay sober today and don't worry about the future. You can do it. In my recent experience, my whole outlooked changed once I stopped drinking. It took a while to really kick in, but day by day things got easier, and my outlook less dark. The things I would tell myself I should be thinking, when I was trying to get out of depression, those are the things I actually think now! I'm now starting to reach out and build connections and embrace the world again. Getting through the first few weeks of sobriety was like fog lifting. Hold in there!"

Don't overlook the fact that before that ""failure"" you succeeded ... 120 times, give or take.  We are quick to beat ourselves up over our stumbles. Try to look at your experience as if it was one of your close friends going through it instead. Would you have told them that they failed after slipping?   And more importantly, would you want to support them if you saw them get back up and make another commitment on the same date a year later? Good. Be sure that you give yourself that same support.   You're back on the path.   Be sure to check back often. Reach out as needed. And if you haven't read it yet, go grab Allen Carr's Easy Way to Control Alcohol.

The thing I find is that if I am allowing a special occasion, then I can make an exception for a few days before. There will likely be alcohol leftover and I don't want to waste that. Then I need some more to taper off that last special occasion. Oh look, there is another special occasion coming up. Suddenly, I find I am just drinking.   The last time I drank after a sober break for a special occasion, I was surprised there was almost zero euphoria or sense of relief. Instead, it felt like a blanket was being pulled back over me. It felt really bad as I felt the clarity, the optimism, the sense of health and well-being, the patience, the motivation all slipping away. It felt even worse with the second drink and I knew it was a bad idea. I don't know how many I ended up having that night. I do know that I ended up isolating because I was slurring my words and was too drunk to participate in any activities. I staggered off to bed and then woke up at 3am.

It doesn't feel that way initially because a big part of me still wants to associate alcohol with relaxation and fun. But that's some serious selective memory. I have nearly no memory at all of most of my birthdays for years beginning with 2 thanks to my drinking, so how can I tell it's a good idea anyway?   I had a birthday around 90 days or so and I was more worried about it before than during. I think venting the concern is wise. It can help you frame it when the time comes.

I don't drink because I said I was quitting forever and yes, Regis, I'll made that my final answer.  There is no way to change the fact that I made that decision so there is no consideration to be had or decision to be made.

It was kind of hard but I told myself that I knew I was doing the right thing, doing what I had to do to have a life again, and the occasion did nothing to change that.

Balance is not something we know much about, we are addicted to more.  Some addictions can be ""healthier"" (at least in the short term)  some like gambling, extreme sports, relationships, food even work, not so much - especially if taken to the extremes we know so well.  Running until stress fractures, working until you fall asleep driving home, relationships where wives/husbands are armed and looking for you, guys named knuckles asking to pay your debts...  Relax, it takes time, and in the early stages, if you aren't drinking or drugging - or in the ER for something else, you are probably ok."

I was not addicted, I did not have withdrawals, but if one drink is good, two is better, 4 is great and 8 is epic!  I am the same way with my exercise. I started with a 5k and that was good.  Next came a half marathon, and then triathlons.  It made me realize that there are healthy, constructive ways to feed my personality rather than destructive ones.  Yes, it might be running and hiding to an extent, but it also keeps me from relapsing.  In moments of weakness I can justify not drinking by telling myself that I can't drink because I'm training.  It also is a way to justify my sobriety to others in a social setting.  It's much less socially awkward to say I'm drinking water because I have a half-Ironman in 5 weeks than to say I 'm having water because I spent 2 decades drinking too  much.

But yeah, it turns out that not having alcohol around to smooth out my emotions can be really hard, and running (literally) away from them does not work for me. I had a lot of self-hate too. It's slowly fading, and the emotional support systems I've invested myself in help with that.  That's not to say that working out isn't important or helpful - exercise elevates my mood and I'm gaining lots of self confidence with my new body.

I started with a weekly me-night where I'd down a six-pack during my Netflix binge.  Over 3 months, I raised it to every other day, and a year ago, I was drinking the same amount daily. Falling into the fantasy world of my favourite shows (while more and more out of it) was an easy way to escape my shortcomings at work. I too felt like I was wasting my life, and this only made me feel worse. I felt awful afterwards and swore to stop - no success. When the 6-packs didn't seem to do the trick, I started earlier in the day, which meant moving to 12/day, and eventually to the hard stuff.   I still don't know how I made it past day 1. I hadn't woken up with any more resolve. Regardless of the why/how, that day of sobreity was a comforting, reassuring pat on the back - one less day I'd feel guilty about. Since then, I've reached out to a close relative, two friends, and this community - anything to remind me of what that seemingly random day kicked off.

stopdrinking,3dicqr,JimBeamsHusband,6,Thu Jul 16 15:17:45 2015 UTC,"I think moderation is a myth.  People who do not have a drinking problem do not moderate.  At least not consciously.  My wife does not count her drinks.  Her body tells her when it's time to stop.  She doesn't crave more or pace out her drinks to ensure maximum drunk.  She has a glass of wine (maybe).  And that's it.  Sure, people with drinking problems can probably set limits and make rules and probably successfully moderate for a finite period of time.  And maybe, for some, that finite period of time is 1 more day than their alive (meaning that the moderate successfully for the rest of their lives), but it'd be a constant struggle.  They'd be counting drinks.  They'd be making rules.  I know for me, if I allowed myself to drink a little here and a little there, there'd be one day that, if my wife was out of town or something, I'd go nuts.  If it was OK for me to have 2 beers last Tuesday, surely 5 beers is OK tonight.  And, well, I had a bad day, so 12 beers is OK now.  Alcohol adds no value to my life.  At all.

I'm guessing that someone who doesn't have an issue with alcohol wouldn't be able to say exactly how many times they got drunk, or even had a drink at all, over the past year?  For me I've always used hard liquor to get drunk. For me beer has always been something I sip and stop after one. I'm fond of craft beers, not the cheap stuff. And, well, more than one hoppy beer doesn't sit too well in my stomach. I really wish my favorite beers came in non-alcohol versions.  I guess my real question isn't if I can moderate hard liquour but if moderating beer is possible.  Edit: I'm not trying to make an excuse to drink. I'm just questioning the method I've used over the past year. Wondering if maybe I should just go none at all, or if cutting out hard liquor and leaving the occasional beer could work for me.

But I decided not to have no control over my temper and within 2-3 weeks I had it under control. That was 9 months ago and while I've had one outburst I've had it controlled.  I guess I kind of see alcohol the same as that. I know that if I'm not careful I'll end up drinking every day again, being in a situation where I'm always drunk. I know I need to make some change, either cutting out all hard liquor or all alcohol and I was hoping to find someone with similar experiences to talk to.  Personally I wouldn't call myself an alcoholic, I'd call myself an addict. I always have to have something that I have an unhealthy relationship with, whether it be video games, a specific type of food, or alcohol. I won't touch drugs because of this (to the point where I refuse anything stronger than an ibuprofen for pain), and I wish I'd never touched hard alcohol. Now it seems so easy to just...take a shot of whatever is in the freezer or cabinet, and then take another shot, and then my control is gone.

For me, If there HAS to be ""something"" external I'm focusing on, then I'm not doing a good job on the inside.

I don't think that hard liquor adds any benefit. I don't enjoy the taste. I enjoy the not worrying about stuff, the lack of stress, and the feeling at first. I don't enjoy the feeling when I'm coming down from drunk or puking in the shower. As for beer, I really enjoy the taste and the social aspect of having a beer with friends. I don't enjoy more than one beer, as I said above it doesn't sit well in my stomach.  I guess the question about the risk would be, is the risk of having one beer and knowing that a few more will make me feel good and not worry worth it?

If you take out hard liquor from the equation, I'd be willing to bet you'd start drinking more craft beer, and although it doesn't settle well for you now, you'll find a way to tolerate it. I know because I was there before too.   You are young, and it's really hard to stop as a younger person. But honestly, do you really want to prolong this process and find yourself at square one/ rock bottom in 5, 10, or 15 years? You have a loving person on your life who doesn't drink, which is a godsend for an addict, and should not be taken lightly.

I used to be the guy that sent embarrassing messages and made a fool of myself when I went out drinking, but I'm not that guy anymore - I'm a guy who DID those things, not a guy who DOES those things. You can change too, and I know it's really, really hard to see that while you're caught up in the web. Have you read Allen Carr's book ""Easy Way to Control Alcohol?"" I'd give it a shot if not!"

I had my girlfriend and family, but I wasn't spending much time outside of the house or just doing things normal people do.  That made me depressed.  I finally had enough texted a guy I was thinking of getting a sponsor, he said he would do it, and I've been trying to spend atleast one or two nights a week going to a meeting with him, and one night a week doing something like disc golfing, grilling and step work, or whatever.

Isolation and self-hatred are also things you can find strategies to work around -- don't despair! Do you have anyone irl to talk to about how you are feeling?

I know it's not for everyone, but AA has been great for me in helping to build a support group of friends that I can talk to about those personal demons on a regular basis.

You just have to find some ways to cope with those feelings for now.  Early on, substituting sodas for beer helped me. That satisfied my urge for a cold, fizzy drink. I also cleaned A LOT. It was a task I could do for 5 minutes at a time, any time, and kept my hands busy."

stopdrinking,3dgxkm,VioletVonStrangt,1 point,Thu Jul 16 04:37:05 2015 UTC,"My last drink was on June 13th. For me to admit that I needed help, took a long time. So long that it cost me my marriage and almost my relationship with my 7 year old son. 2+ years from the time my wife asked me to seek help for my addiction.   Looking back at why I decided to quit...I had a ""higher power intervention"". God (or my brain, whatever you wanna call it) told me to quit or I was going to drink myself to death. Not see my son grow up and graduate.   My first meeting was June 14th. I didn't wait to go. I was nervous, scared, unsure of myself, etc. My first meeting was awesome. Everybody was welcoming and understanding. Most of the meetings I've been to have been that way. I feel so comfortable at them now. I look forward to them. Never would have thought that 34 days ago.  You can do it if you really want to. I've found most people outside of AA that I've told to be very understanding and supportive. My boss' have been great to me.  Good luck and keep coming back to /r/stopdrinking. Lots of help and support here."
stopdrinking,3dgxkm,widmer6969,1 point,Thu Jul 16 05:03:10 2015 UTC,"My first step was to start at a professional addiction counseling program (Rehab After Work). I am lucky to have really good health insurance from my work, so it was mostly covered. Since it is health care for a recognized disease, I knew my anonymity was legally protected, and I would have grounds for a lawsuit if my company fired me for using the service.  That got me started on recovery, but it's been AA that really helped me with building a sold long term approach to sobriety. I was also lucky that my wife was supportive of my recovery, at least partly because she doesn't want to deal with a drunk for a spouse.  I truly hope that your husband would understand if you started a recovery program of some sort. Weighing the alternatives, I'm sure you'll see that drinking will do a lot more damage to your life than recovery will. Keep coming back here for support, and decide for yourself what road will lead to the best outcome for your life."

I would encourage you to go back through your post and comment history and try and get as honest a grip as you can on why you decided to stop drinking and stay stopped.  Why was it important in the first place?  And now, what do you think you're missing?   You know if you ever read my Saturday Share how relapse worked out for me, so I'm not going to lecture you.  I will say that if I knew then what I know now--I would have begged my friends to lock me away until the impulse passed.  I barely averted death, for what?  To pour alcohol down my face!  What a waste.  My friend, I understand the impulse.  If you spend anytime sober you probably can't avoid the thought that you're missing something.  New craft beers, fine wines, parties, events, sophistication--in my experience it was all tears and ashes and tragedy."

I thought I had conquered my problem, and just wanted to get back to how I was before.  I thought I was awesome when I was loaded all the time.  The memories of my drinking days were awesome to me. I thought I did better socially and was a happier person than sober me.  So I did it.  I picked up a bottle and drank it.  No big deal.  Then it got progressively worse and worse.  Here I am four years later on my 10th wedding anniversary with a wife who won't talk to me, a job that's about to fall apart, little relationships left and at my wits end.  I talked to a friend about why I started drinking again and told him my reasoning.  He reminded me that I wasn't awesome before I quit drinking.  I was a sloppy mess.  He kindly pointed out all the failures and mistakes that happened that my addled brain had omitted to trick me into indulging my disease again.  It was never okay, I was never okay. You can do what you feel you need to, and this internet stranger certainly won't be able to change your mind, but just make sure you play out the What Ifs for both sides of the coin."

In other words, alcohol was a way for me to get myself to do stuff I don't like to do. Which, for me, is kind of crazy.   I think I've learned (and am learning) that I can either 1) Learn how I can like situations--like good parties--without drinking; or, 2) Accept that I don't like some situations--like hanging around in bars--and just don't do them much or at all. I do either of these, depending on the situation. Accepting what I liked (good company) and what I really didn't (drunk conversation) was helpful."

So I used to love going to the movies, I didn't and never needed alcohol to make my movie going experience awesome. However, once I was in sobriety, completely abstaining from alcohol and other things; I found that I can not tolerate going to the movies. I am overly anxious and ill prepared to handle the number of people coming into the theater. Since I got sober I have gone to see: DBZ (I forgot which flick, but this was July 2014), Godzilla, and Jurassic World. I will probably steel my nerves for SW VII, but I am missing the experience for maybe 20 other movies that I would like to enjoy at the theater, but I can't bring myself to go knowing that a crush of people will be there.    At most, I can spend 4 hours around people that are not my girlfriend; including my family. When people come over, I end up 'hiding' in my bedroom because I do not want to deal with them. At work I work in the warehouse by myself, and have occasional interaction with truck drivers and my boss. I have lost something, and I have no clue how to get it back."
stopdrinking,3depla,djamberj,3,Wed Jul 15 19:23:10 2015 UTC,"I think this is exactly the point because it's one that I'm still exploring. Getting alcohol out of the way didn't solve my problems--it helped reveal them. Painful as it was and is, this means that I can work on them. I see a counselor--not an addiction therapist anymore, but a general therapist--to work on this stuff. Drinking comes up now and again, but my focus is on all the puzzling stuff that I didn't bother to figure out during the many years when I drank.   I still have these problems, and they're profound to the point of wrecking a marriage. But I know, I know, that drinking again will not solve or alleviate them. There are many ways to deal with life's problems; drinking is not one of them. For me."

I need breaks from social interaction where I can just be alone and restore some sanity and I have pretty bad social anxiety.  Of course drinking helps that A LOT, but I realized it's just not worth it for myself in the long run.  I'm not sure how much counseling can help with my own social anxiety (my responses to social interaction are physiological and it seems like I can't stop it) but it works for some and there are some medications that help.  I regret taking so long to talk to my doctor about it when there are so many options."

stopdrinking,3depla,randoker,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:37:42 2015 UTC,"So let me ask you a hypothetical question:  If I understand correctly, you want to drink because you think it will make these social situations easier/better/tolerable. If there was some other solution that didn't involve drinking, would you investigate it?  What I'm reading sounds like you have a social anxiety disorder. Alcohol is not an effective treatment (though it might hide the problem when you have access to it). There are actual therapies for getting anxiety under control."

I depend on alcohol to socialize and when I was younger people always told me how much fun I was when I was drinking. Now I just drink to kill myself though; Not fun anymore. Hope you can figure all this out in a healthy way. Hey, last night I watched a great BBC documentary about the real effects of drinking on the brain and body. These 2 twin scientists decided to conduct a self experiment. One would binge drink and one would moderate, and they would measure the health effects over time."
stopdrinking,3depla,rose_the_wolf,7,Wed Jul 15 19:03:51 2015 UTC,"Thank you for sharing these thoughts with us. I have definitely had similar thoughts lately, like I drank because I was depressed, but now that I'm not depressed maybe I can drink again. Now that I know what the bad road looks like, maybe I can stay on the good one. It's based on the false assumption that I can control my drinking. It's a denial of Step One.  I've been combating it by reflecting on my former drinking patterns, admitting to myself that I didn't have control every single time I drank, and asking myself what the addition of alcohol would do for me. Would it really make my life better? And if I feel I need alcohol to improve my life, isn't that an indicator of bigger issues? offtherocks had a great quote about this:   Most non-alcoholics wouldn't consider not drinking to be so life impacting. The very fact that you value drinking so highly should tell you something. If you told me today that I could never eat cottage cheese again, I'd probably say, ""No? Oh, that's too bad,"" and move on with my life. I wouldn't spend my days hoping & praying to find a loophole. If I did, I'd have to seriously consider that I just might be an cottage cheeseaholic."

The biggest advantage of using alcohol, for me, is ""OBLIVION"". Big capital letters, underlined, and all. On the CBA I did my first week after stopping, the biggest advantage is ""Buzz."" Underneath I note ""buzz to blackout. Shutting down the brain/emotion."" Even a year ago, I realized that I wasn't drinking for the taste, or like a normal person does. I've proved that to myself, with a couple of beers after my first month and a few celebratory sips. Those tastes did NOTHING for me--the beer tasted like shit.  From my May CBA, my biggest reason to not drink is mental health. Again, big letters and underlines. And I'm the guy that got suicidal 5 months into sobriety. But I'm dealing with that, learning to cope, and feeling better. Booze was just hiding that issue, or allowing me to black out and avoid the pity party.  I wonder what your CBA would look like if you did it tomorrow, after your replies here and re-reading your old posts. Maybe it would change.

So regardless of what your wife says, you can still be happy by engaging in behavior that makes you happy. I needed the 12 Steps. I needed a Sponsor and a Home Group. I needed a counselor. I needed an excercise program and diet that allowed me to feel healthy.  I am no longer a punchline at work. My wife no longer wants a Divorce. I have a wonderfully rewarding relationship with my children.   If you allow this negative feeling to control you your experiences will likely be miserable. It doesn't have to be that way though. Regardless what your Wife or anyone else thinks. You have the key to your happiness not anyone else."

The worst of it is I'm just now realizing how long I've been putting off dealing with her death because it was easier just to get shit-faced and black-out. It's not a long term solution, and it will only make things worse in time. Come see us on /r/widowers it's widows too, and it helped me a lot in the early days after her death."

Going through difficult experiences as a sober person has been somehow satisfying, like diving into a cold pool and coming up for air, clear headed. Hurting, but clear.

Drinking is very expensive, and there are so many better things to do with the money, like taking nice trips or getting a massage (among millions of other things).

I'd give anything if I could roll the clock back and tell my wife how sincerely sorry I was.

When I got sober in 1986 (for the first 15 years) the only ""loss"" I thought I had sustained was my relationship with my first wife who had been my childhood sweetheart.  I did lose that relationship but like JBH I was able SOBER to sit down with her one time and express my sincere regret.  Unlike JBH it was way too early in my recovery and I'm afraid it sounded like nothing but words, meaningless words.  And the damage I had done by then was not repairable with words.  As JBH points out, honest words gain credibility with honest actions."

I waited to talk to my wife about this (and others) until I was already doing the things I said I would do to prevent the mistakes in the future.

I also had a list of reasons not to drink and I'd ignore it all over and over again. Do you want to stop drinking? I sure didn't. I didn't want be an alcoholic anymore but I didn't want to stop drinking. I didn't know what to do. In the end I started going to AA meetings with no intention to stop drinking. I just went to listen to people talk about our shared problem. I went to meetings at lunch during the week and went home after work and drank. Drinking slowly changed for me. I saw a way out. I became more and more aware of how bad my problem was. I went to meetings almost every day for about 4 months before I finally decided I didn't want to drink anymore. I really recommend you check out AA meetings, whether or not you want to quit. Nothing is going to change for you. Start moving yourself into a place where you can make a decision for yourself. Knowledge is power. Evidence of real people who have suffered as you have and overcome the addiction is crucial.   My heart goes out to you.

Don't let those issues give you a ""reason"" to start drinking again.  You didn't lose everything, your life may have changed in a negative way because of your drinking but you're changing that by being sober and fixing things that are fixable.  I quit a ten year fifth/day of vodka habit and my wife likely was ready to move on as well.  When I quit, and after I got out of the ER, I made a list of shit that needed done around the house, stuff I'd half completed but got too drunk to finish and I checked each one off as the new sober me did them.  I started doing more chores without being told/asked.  I started doing more cardio and asked her to join me and she would sometimes.  I built things, took classes in ceramics and glass blowing and shit like that.  I always asked her to join me and sometimes she would.  I bought a canoe so we could go out onto the lake together and read books.  I did a lot of things I NEVER would have done had continued to drink and over time she started to trust me, this was a big issue because the drunk me would constantly lie about my drinking and hide booze.  Hell, when I cleared out the house of the booze I had like 25 water bottles filled with vodka hidden around the house.  I used to put vodka in Vitamin Water bottles and toss them in the garbage can near our house then take the trash out later to retrieve the bottle.  When I quit I told her all my lies and all my tricks and hiding places and she was disgusted with me, rightfully so, I was disgusted with me.  But I didn't quit for her to be honest, I quit because I wanted a better life, I wanted my old life back, the one where I wasn't a slave to booze, where going to the beach didn't mean I better make sure I pack enough alcohol because there are no shops near there, where I could watch a hockey game and not worry about last call.  If you keep sober and change your life for the better your wife will see that, she might not let you know right away, but she'll see it at least and that's all you can ask for from her at this point.  Just keep showing her by showing yourself how you can beat this fucking disease.  Best of luck to you, my man, and for what it's worth I hope your next anniversary is the hap-hap-happiest of all!"

When I finally quit drinking after ten years I remember all the crazy stuff I used to do while drunk fishing, grabbing sharks and dragging them back into the ocean, boating drunk, seemed so freakin stupid now that I was sober.  Also, I have a ton of photos of me with huge catches or just hanging out with friends fishing and in every one I have a water bottle nearby, only, everyone knew that was vodka and not water in there.  Now I take my kids fishing often and it's so much better being sober, it's actually relaxing for once!  Even when nothing's biting we'll go wading for crabs or play catch.

It's your choice if you want to use that blade to continue to cause yourself and others pain, or  to use the other edge to forge ahead through the underbrush and make the most of yourself in your future knowing that nothing can undo the past. It sounds like you've made that choice already, so only look back as a reminder of what you don't want to be anymore. It takes courage to cop to our mistakes, even anonymously on the internet. You clearly have strength, so don't sell yourself short and don't be the one holding your self back. You are worth it :)"

I did some reading on this bc I was really interested in how alcoholic bitters actually is.  I think you may find comfort in this:   When I am taking a break from drinking, I often rely on a very simple drink that almost any bar can make, something that is easy to sip with more complexity and flavor than having a soda. Angostura makes perhaps the most well-known bitters in the world, used in most of the key spirit-forward classic cocktails like the Old Fashioned and the Manhattan. Angostura is a mix of herbs, water, sugar, gentian, and spirit that acts like a binding agent in drinks (bringing all the flavors together). Although Angostura is spirit based (and has 44.7% alcohol), the amount you use in a drink is fairly small. I did some measuring and 5 dashes of Angostura equals ¬º tsp which has 0.550 ml of alcohol. To put that in perspective, a low alcohol beer with 3% alcohol would have 7.09 ml of alcohol in an 8 ounce serving, or 14.0ml in a pint. You can get intoxicating qualities from Angostura, but you need to use a full 1-2 ounces."

My roommate is allergic to coconut oil (but loves it) and I use it extensively. Every so often I offer her something I made and she has to remind me again of her allergy. I don't mean to tempt her, but at the same token I cannot relate to her at all because I don't have the reaction to it as she does.

You can't control the behavior of others.  But you can control your own reactions and realize that their offer is out of courtesy, not animosity.  They may not understand that you have an issue, and quite frankly, they don't have to.  It's not their issue.    One of the things I've learned in sobriety is that your sobriety has to be your concern.  Other people will do what they will do, and that's not a jab at you.  Some of my best friends offer me drinks knowing that I don't drink.  I just shake it off and move on with my life.  Just like someone offering me something I'm allergic to.  If i was allergic to peanuts and someone offered me a pb&j I'd say no, realize the offer was a courtesy, not them trying to kill me, and move on.  You got this!!"

She doesn't have a problem like I do, and if she did I couldn't tell her to stop because there no way she would.     I could tell that my girlfriend was different when she got fired from her job, and by the time I got how, she hadn't already had 5 drinks, honestly she didn't even drink for a week or so after that moment... Old me would of been 3 sheets to the wind in the hour it took her to get home.  I guess What I am trying to say, is people are going to do there thing, and really you can't change them.  My girlfriend knew I was quitting drinking, so she has slowed down a lot, for the most part I think she drank as much as she did because I did.  You can tell your girlfriend it bothers you that she smokes, but it she wants to smoke she will.  If her smoking is getting you off track of staying sober, then it may be time to look at getting a new living situation, or telling her that.  I think the first year stuff is hard, if you have a sponsor talk to them, but really Sobriety should be number 1, you may have to cut some relationships out to make that happen... I hope this can help."

I feel selfish because of the way her smoking makes me feel and in recovery I'm trying not to be so selfish anymore.  It's a fine line though."
stopdrinking,3dekcc,J-Stan,2,Wed Jul 15 18:33:55 2015 UTC,"When I decided to get Sober 10 months ago, I was in a relationship with an alcoholic.  It made it impossible for me to get better, so I cut it off.  I did try to get her help and she wasn't having it.  It's sad, but it's something to consider.  If it was weed, I would have felt the same way.  Ask yourself ""am I capable of getting better while in this relationship?""  I have a feeling you wouldn't be here if this wasn't hurting you."

One thing I try to do when discussing topics like this is not to use gross exaggerations like ""all day every day"".  I would look at myself and determine if the smoking was really, truly bothering me.  Then, I would articulate (to myself) why and how.  Then I'd have an honest discussion with her about those things.  When I had the discussion, I would frame as much of it on myself (""When you smoke so much it makes me feel ..."").  Good luck."

Though not at Betazoid level, some people are naturally more empathic than others (not psychic though).  It sounds like the OP was talking about empathic people who have poor boundaries in relationships and who have a tendency to be co-dependent with narcissists.    I also really like the idea of drinking as taking out a payday loan on your happiness.  What an apt comparison!"

stopdrinking,3ddlgi,crawcraw15,3,Thu Jul 16 13:42:51 2015 UTC,"For me, the process or recovery took a long time (and is still ongoing).  Avoiding labels, my self esteem was twisted, warped, both over and under inflated - and I was drawn to people who were emotionally unavailable.    my tools included the steps of AA ( and yes there are other paths) and slowly I became comfortable in my own skin.  Less dependent on  others approval and with a more reasonable opinion of myself.  It helped that I was no longer doing so much stupid stuff.  Alcohol was the wrong medication for what ailed me.   Learning to breathe was important."
stopdrinking,3ddlgi,glimmeringsea,2,Wed Jul 15 13:49:51 2015 UTC,Alcohol makes it worse.  You know this.  My banged up face and car will also attest to this.    Have you tried meditation?   Maybe some anti-depressants if you still need help.  There are much better drugs than alcohol if you need to gothat route.    Edit:  Also - daily exercise.    You should only use alcohol if you can have one or two drinks to lighten up the mood for social interaction and quit at will.  Using it for stress or pain relief spells disaster.  Remember how you were when you first quit.
stopdrinking,3ddlgi,glimmeringsea,2,Wed Jul 15 13:24:45 2015 UTC,"I don't know what you've tried for depression and anxiety in the past, but talk therapy and CBT can help a lot.  Also if your sleep is really bad, doing a sleep study might be worthwhile. I think anxiety and dread can be symptoms of sleep apnea, too.  Of course these suggestions assume you have insurance that will properly cover them.  Take care. Bad days will pass."
stopdrinking,3ddlgi,tankerraid,1 point,Wed Jul 15 14:06:48 2015 UTC,"My personal opinion of CBT is that it is mainly a placebo effect, you reframe your thinking of the situation on the assumption that your perception is wrong.  However, what if your assessment is correct? Sometimes people are arseholes, sometimes life is very unfair, sometimes the whole situation just does absolutely suck.  How does CBT help then?"
stopdrinking,3ddlgi,IrishOrganic,3,Wed Jul 15 15:31:51 2015 UTC,"Well yeah, sobriety is largely about learning coping mechanisms for dealing when people are assholes. I don't think CBT means assuming your perspective is always wrong; it's a framework to help assess situations and not get mired in things you can't control or spiral into negativity whenever you're faced with a problem.  Anyway it was just a suggestion. Different therapies work for different people."

As regards CBT, I was discussing my viewpoint with my psychaitrist, and he said, ""Well, instead of killing yourself, you could always....(awkward pause) go for a walk?"" - it amused me that his suggestion was so lame, but definitely preferable to my default position.  Strangely, it helps to know that the answers and the way forward are not easy."

stopdrinking,3de0jo,gogomom,2,Wed Jul 15 19:52:02 2015 UTC,"AlAnon helped me immensely when my husband relapsed after rehab and I wanted to stay clean and sober.  The biggest thing I've learned from AlAnon is the idea that you can't change someone else.  I did that co-dependent dance for a long time (still doing it sometimes) and someone said to me in a meeting that I needed to stop circling my addict - but I couldn't stop doing the whole checking the bank accounts, hiding keys, dumping out booze, etc, etc, etc, etc....  and that same person said to me ""You are finding it very hard to change yourself and your own actions, right?  Why do you think anything you are doing will change his actions?  It's hard to change yourself, impossible to change someone else.""  It was one of those ah-ha moments for me. I had to decide - do I want to live with an active alcoholic, or do I want to leave - because the choice I wanted and hoped for - to live with my recovering husband - wasn't going to be an option until he decides for himself that it is an option - but then it will likely be too late, but it made me realize the ONLY person I can change is me, and that's hard enough."
stopdrinking,3de0jo,Ihearcolor,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:27:32 2015 UTC,"The betrayal is that he says he wants to change, he's doing it for him, recovery is his top priority, etc. etc. etc. He's just such a charming liar. So the relapses are all the more bitter. He says he's changing, he says all the right damn things. I've taken a step back but I'm completely resentful of the situation. If he's not paying our bills, it's MY credit that tanks, too. It's MY self that is liable for marital debt, etc. etc. etc. Why do I do everything right and make progress and he gets to do whatever the hell he wants? This is my big problem with AlAnon, and I still go to meetings. This whole ""loving detachment"" thing sure sounds nice, and I'm trying my hardest to practice it, but what happens when the check bounces and they call ME? There are practical responsibilities in life and whether my husband likes it or not, I need to protect my financial standing, especially if I choose to leave. I know in my very marrow that I can't change him, but I'm not going to learn all these tools in AlAnon for living a half-marriage with someone who's acting like a child. Just because I CAN tolerate it with a lot of one-sided work that he's not reciprocating, doesn't mean I want to."
stopdrinking,3de0jo,Ihearcolor,2,Wed Jul 15 19:50:20 2015 UTC,"Exactly - that is exactly the point - you have to look at it as if he's NOT going to change no matter what and make your decisions in life based on that.  It literally took me YEARS to get to the point where I accept he's an alcoholic, he says he wants to change, but does nothing to move in that direction - and he knows what to do to get help, he's been to freakin' rehab - so I've decided 18 years of waiting for him to grow up and take responsibility for himself and his future is enough - I'm out of there end of August - it's not that I don't love him, I simply can no longer live with an alcoholic.  Loving detachment - the whole idea is a challenge to me too.  The way I see it is that I love my AH, I care about him and his well being, but I can do nothing to change anything about him - I pay the bills because I have to (my AH has never paid a bill in our 18 year marriage - he earns the money and sticks in the account, but has never actually paid anything), I take care of ME and my kids, what he does (dinner, laundry, etc) is up to him, because I refuse to be responsible for a grown adult.    The best is when you stop enabling and they look around and wonder why there is so many beer cans beside the bed, or why the car has no gas, or why the lawn isn't cut, or why they slept in a lawn chair last night, etc, etc, etc....  that was actually a little fun for me, not that it changed anything, but I was highly amused when he realized what a slob he was without me picking up after him."

My issue is a little more insidious: He is high functioning. He has a top leadership job, he pays the bills (this took some work, though, he originally didn't do any of that), he does more laundry than I do, he cooks, the lawn looks great, he goes to AA 6 days a week and is in constant contact with his sponsor, he has an individual therapist and we have a couple's therapist...   He's just a liar and has taken his drinking underground ever since ""we"" (meaning me) got sober two months ago. He just lies. He was doing all this therapy and AA and simply omitting mention of his drinking. Or he has been until about three weeks ago when, on the day of the embryo transfer (the ""no turning back"" point when they actually create the pregnancy, if there's going to be one), I found his fucking vodka and there was no denying it any longer. Jut the day before, he'd been telling our couple's counselor how great sobriety was, and it turns out he hadn't experienced a lick of it!  I'd love to expose him to his dark, slovenly self but...he's actually pretty darn put together. Except he's still quite sick, and all the trust in our relationship is gone.   I do recognize that I have enabled him in the past, big time. And that's exactly what his family has always done, so I have sworn not to be yet another voice of ""support"" for what he's doing. (His mother is a huge alcoholic and so any effort on either of our parts to get healthy has been met with incredible hostility, because if we're looking at our drinking, questions about Mama's chardonnay habit can't be far behind!)

There was this woman at my AA group once who was saying all of these affirming things, and then was like, ""Of course, I don't believe a fucking word I'm saying, but I've been told that if I say it enough, it'll turn true."" We all got a good laugh out of that one, but that's exactly how I feel right now. All this ""When you're going through hell, keep going"" stuff sounds REALLY GOOD, but as I'm actually going through hell, I just want to gnash and kick and scream and blame wallow in self-pity and rage. That's emotional relapse for me. I'm addicted to those emotions as much, if not more, than I ever was to alcohol.   Anyway. Thanks for saying the thing about not wanting to burn out, too. I'm just doing so much, and I'm starting to feel like it ""owes"" me something, and it's just not a good scene. I went to AA today and we had a great talk about pride/humility, which helped."

stopdrinking,3dbap7,ikkenorwegian,1 point,Tue Jul 14 23:52:16 2015 UTC,"honestly man / girlfriend , i doubt you will have a craving. i guess it is different for everyone . personally i rarely 'want' a drink. sometimes when I'm hanging out with friends / family at night, they will be drinking, i'll feel sort of awkward as if I want one . . but the urge always passes quickly.   when my friends are doing shots I imagine the next morning, their inevitable hangover. I don't envy that.   as we grow older, we all have to choose our vices carefully. I think , for those of us that can't control ourselves, are in a great spot.   In my early months I used to view recovering alcoholics, including myself, in an almost negative light! as if, wow, we can't drink , but the temptation is always there..  I know this is really rambly but what I'm trying to say is, at 6 months I really don't crave booze . I still think about it.   but as a recovering alcoholic I think I really do have an advantage over most people, whether they drink a little or drink a lot. Not that this is a competition - I'm just thinking, that I am in a really good position as a sober person.   It's such a liberating feeling knowing every day and every night i am making clear, honest decisions. I can be proud of my work because I know I'm not tired or hungover from the previous night. I feel wholesome because I know my friends and family are thinking about me, they enjoy my company and they see the sober me, the recovering me who is more content than he was 5 months ago, who is making progress and becoming a stronger, wiser person.   good for you on 5 months. I know that the emotions can get difficult, and the mental ride of sorting out all the jib-jab in your head is not always a good time. Don't forget to take some time for yourself just to relax , and try to do something you might normally not do (go camping, hiking for the weekend, or buy a spot on a charter and go fishing for half a day) .. Have some fun. without booze of course.   I find that helps. Put yourself in a situation where you really want to have fun, of course without alcohol. then do it. you will come out of it feeling awesome, and also you will feel confident that you can handle other situations in the future without alcohol.  I just had a vacation, was worried that I wouldn't do well without booze. I had an amazing time, and I feel really good about life in general after relaxing and knowing that I can do a vacation sober and find fun, and peace."

I got to a point I was drinking to black out (and beyond) every day despite really earnestly wanting not to drink, but I really loved that sweet spot pre-black out where everything just felt SO good. There's no touching that. The trick is that sweet spot became shorter and shorter and more and more costly. That sweet spot cost me relationships, career progress, safety, financial gain, and a LOT of dignity. That sweet spot was so good it seemed worth it, but the next morning it obviously wasn't. I'd convince myself I'd not drink that day, but by late afternoon I was already back at the bottle shop.  It didn't have to get that bad. I could have stopped much earlier, say around 20, if I admitted that I had lost control over my drinking and it was costing me more than it was giving me.   It sounds like you might be around there, but I get how powerful that draw to drink is. It's SO great that it makes us blind to how costly it really is. Thing is: it's even more costly than it seems, and it's not as good as it feels. I think it felt so good to hit that sweet spot because my life was falling apart. Getting drunk gives me a reprieve from the devastation that getting drunk causes.   Getting sober means that I don't have my hot second of bliss every night before I black out and do something stupid. It also means I have to tell fewer lies to keep it a secret, and that I don't have to scrimp together money from various credit accounts every day to get money get fucked up again. It's pretty slick.   How can we help you? Do you have ideas on how to stay sober or if that's what you really want?"
stopdrinking,3dcp6d,disastermode,2,Wed Jul 15 06:21:45 2015 UTC,"I'd just like to thank you for your reply! I'm at the point where I've been drinking everyday, and know I should not be drinking everyday.  It's scary how much I can relate to that ""sweet spot"". It does get harder and harder to attain while becoming more and more costly.. The workers at the beer store know me, and don't even I.D me anymore. For the last few days I've been saying ""I'm not going to drink today"", but I'll realize I still have alcohol, so it becomes ""Okay, I'll only have a beer or two"", and then my desire to not drink becomes with my desire to hit that sweet spot. Tomorrow will be the first day in a while that I won't have liquor/beer in the house.   I also feel like I'm at that point where I can stop, I won't do anything too shady in the following week, but I will have a strong desire to drink on pay-day and that will make me want to drink the next day, because it's Saturday, why the fuck not? I'd like to be at the point where I don't drink Sunday, and Monday as well..   This is also worse than my drinking has ever been, in the past I've had the ability to drink and then stop for a few days. I've never been drinking for roughly 2 weeks in a row before, I'm worried, because I am very well aware how harmful drinking in excess can be.  I haven't mentioned my problem to anyone before, I am very withdrawn in a lot of ways. I would like to gauge how I feel in the follow week and I'll determine how strong the urge to drink will actually be.   Just getting this out there helped me, your reply definitely helped me relate to you and I cannot thank you enough. I do want to drink less, I don't know if I'm at the point where I will need to be 100% sober, I don't know if I'd be able to manage that, all of my friends drink on a somewhat regular basis and I would feel a bit alienated from the group, probably.  I recently purchased a few books so that will help me get through the week, is there any advice you can give me about getting through the withdrawal symptoms?"
stopdrinking,3dcp6d,disastermode,2,Wed Jul 15 06:52:01 2015 UTC,"I'm simultaneously happy and sorry to hear that you relate to that ""sweet spot"" thing. Sometimes there's a lot of power in knowing that we're not alone in this thing, though.   You might well be at a point where you can develop the tools to drink moderately. I'm afraid I blasted through that point and got in some pretty deep and desperate alcoholism and ended up seeking help through A.A. because I just couldn't stop starting, and when I started I couldn't stop. We identify two symptoms of alcoholism in AA: the physical craving (having one drink and not being able to stop) and the mental obsession (depending on your interpretation: thinking that this time if I drink it will be different despite a lot of evidence to the contrary OR the obsession that I might one day again drink normally despite no supporting evidence of that being sustainable.) Someone with more time and experience might correct me on this, but if these two symptoms aren't relatable, then maybe you're not an alcoholic. I'll admit that I think you might be in some hot water with the family history and the habit you describe, but that is your call to make.   As for withdrawals, I think the safest thing to say is to talk to your doctor. I did it kind of dumb and just shook my way through a itchy, sleepless few nights and convinced myself that the critters I occasionally saw weren't real. It was a horrible experience. People vary in how bad it is, but it can be genuinely dangerous through to mildly uncomfortable. I hear a lot about increased anxiety, depression, and insomnia the first couple little while after sobering up which was part of my experience too. A doc might be able to help with that."

It strips you of everything you believed to be fun and exciting before you were introduced to alcohol. I'll bet that most ctivities you find fun now has alcohol attached to it. It doesn't have to be that way. You can enjoy life in its purest form.   Every day the haze clears more and more and you become a better happier you.

Some people develop it and others don't. For example you could be a heavy drinker for decades and not develop it or you could just binge drink once a week and be slowly developing it. I've read of people on forums diagnosed with Cirrhosis at  very young age that really don't fit the profile of an alcoholic.
