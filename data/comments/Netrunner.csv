I was under the impression that all promos were created by a secondary printer and were made on a different card stock from the mass printed cards.  In regard to topic one, the de-inking thread should absolutely not be removed from this subreddit. It's unfortunate that people can use the process to create counterfeit versions of the card but simply removing the thread won't stop that from happening. It's on the internet so it is now essentially everywhere. If they don't get it here, they'll find it elsewhere (such as Imgur, where the entire tutorial is hosted with photos).

However, as wonderful as it is to have custom cards for personal use; giving more exposure to instructions for how to infringe copy-right protections AND rip off the rest of the community isn't great either.  I'm not saying this needs to be taken off the internet; I'm asking if its something we want easily and readily available on easily the most frequented netrunner community page? If we stomp the thread we risk quashing reativity; but we also risk creating new counterfeiters if we leave it up.  It is a double edged sword. If you can easily make $75-$200 a pop by scamming netrunner promos its bad for the community and for some people who are in need of that money and have the means they might not be able to resist the temptation.

There's definitely differences in size between the early alts even between themselves. Compare your Melange to any regular art card and see if there's a difference in size. It should definitely be noticeable. The new alts have size much closer to the regular cards.  As for the flimsyness, I was surprised that the Melange was a bit flimsier than Kati or Scorch. The colors are also way off in the back.  Hope that helps!"
Netrunner,3e3vn5,Ravengm,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:55:22 2015 UTC,"Hmm, maybe the melanges are just weird; I'll need to compare in person. The cut is the same as a draft card, but the ink is shiny by comparison; most promos & draft cards which use the same printing process have a matte finish that removes any reflection. Whereas the melange is 100% glossy that I have; I don't recall any melanges I've seen being glossy, but they are usually sleeved.  Hoping I'm not crying wolf. Was why I asked to begin with.  The card is not taller than a standard ANR card, but it is slightly wider, by the same margin as a draft card; The coloring is off on the back of the card which is inline with what you're saying.

In this respect, I've been wondering if I should switch to Silhouette, indeed, if I run easily the HQ and expose cards every time I do so, then I can know when agendas are in the remotes and run them immediately especially if the Corp can't protect them fast enough due to Unscheduled Maintenance."

You learn so much more from the games you lose than the game you win. I was piloting an HB fast advance deck for a long time that was highly dependent on Biotic Labor and rezing SanSan City Grid. Neither is cheap. I remember getting absolutely trashed by Desperado/Security Testing builds until I figured out I could not leave open servers. I rebuilt my deck to be able to turtle up if need be and shut down that nonsense. But I could still punish runners who had no way to exploit exposed asset econ with naked PADs, Adonis Campaigns, and even SanSans. Only learned this from getting slapped around in competitive play."
Netrunner,3e2cwz,jkopplin,6,Tue Jul 21 13:10:29 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I always recommend for people to go to their first tournament with the objective to play Netrunner, winning isn't even part of the objective.  After that I advise them to shoot for breaking even for the day - and thats my end goal. Everytime I've walked into a tournament with some illusions of placing in the top I've lost out, and everytime I've been relaxed and just focused on at least breaking even, I've managed to be calm and collected long enough to meet that goal or even get into the top brackets."
Netrunner,3e2cwz,vampire0,2,Tue Jul 21 13:49:52 2015 UTC,"I played in four store championships this spring, which all have a cut to top four. I took exactly fifth three separate times, either by a single point or by strength of schedule. That was frustrating but I still had a good time and knew I played to the best of my ability. I played in the Wausau, WI ANRPC qualifier this last weekend. There were players from as far away as Chicago (about 300 miles away). I took 8th place out of 21.

A lot of top players have videos or streams online. Try to watch as many as possible to learn how they play. Chances are they've done the same thing (there is a lot of group think/knowledge sharing at high levels in Netrunner).   In casual games I feel I make a lot of mistakes that tournament people just would not do and certain cards that everyone has I can't seem to pilot that well.   Everyone makes mistakes. If you are noticing your mistakes that's a huge positive because it gives you room to improve. The way you improve is practice.   The tournaments I've done the best in came off playing at least a few games a day for a few weeks. In addition to making fewer mistakes little things like knowing the cost of certain card combinations sped up my thought process and allowed me more time to mentally focus on things I might have missed otherwise.  Really though, the more you practice the better you will get. No one just wakes up good at a competitive card game."

My favorites are:  Find testing partners and just play a ton.  Go back and talk through your decisions whenever you're not sure.  Get your opponents' testing perspective.  Play people who are better than you are, a lot.  Learn that meta. Watch the videos; Read the lists (stimhack is good for this); And start trying to think on a deeper level about the fundamentals of the game and where you think its going and why.  And finally, keep a journal for your OCTGN and testing games so that you can go back and see what you did/what worked/what didn't. Things to keep track of: -- Cards that sit in your hand that you never use -- Cards that you use that seem to have no affect on the game -- Uses of specific cards -- Credit rates, that is, what parts of the game are you suffering for cash or flush with it. -- Cards that you wished you had, but did not have access to; Things you could have done to replicate that scenario, but gained an advantage."

Netrunner,3e2cwz,SirChimpster,3,Tue Jul 21 22:49:42 2015 UTC,"Play lots. Play top tier decks. Watch games from high level events. Do a bit of reading. But most importantly, play lots. And play against people better than you, and ask them to tell you after what you should have done differently. You can also play against someone better than you whilst someone watches you play and gives you feedback after. Whilst I think it's good to play different top tier decks to understand them, find ones that you enjoy playing and get good at them, again, by playing lots, and by watching videos of the decks being piloted by others"
Netrunner,3e2cwz,firefrenchy,3,Tue Jul 21 12:55:07 2015 UTC,"Play all the big archetypes. Also play against them. This will give a good idea about each decks strengths and weaknesses and allow you have make an assessment of your game plan when you first start to play. Above all remember it's fun! Don't get bogged down on losses, enjoy the learning experience! Hope that helps!"
Netrunner,3e2cwz,danrich2910,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:41:45 2015 UTC,"To piggyback on this, seriously consider ""maining"" one of the big archetypes. While you can definitely do well with non-mainstream decks, I think that its easier to learn to be a competetive player if you can be sure that your deck isn't holding you back. Also, when you play a deck over a long period of time, you become more skilled at playing that deck."

You're playing against people who you feel are better than you; ask them about the games afterwards. Try to get them to identify the places where you made the mistakes, figure out why you made those mistakes.   Do it for every game, win or lose. Do it with every opponent. Sure, there are always going to be times where you lose because you miscalculated the statistics and failed, or you misread the opponent, and improving those parts just comes with more games, but most important is identifying your particular habits and faults and improving on those"
Netrunner,3e2cwz,Mo0man,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:01:24 2015 UTC,"A lot of good advice already. I would emphasize to improve your playing, you should play decks that have demonstrated winning big tournaments (i.e. net deck). Deckbuilding and playing are different skills, so it's better to just concentrate on one at a time. If you don't do well in games, it will be hard to tell if it's your playing or your deck unless you use a known good deck (i.e. control for variables).  You should check out the forums at Stimhack, if you haven't already. It is where a lot of competitive players read and post (~90%+ is about how to get better and build better decks and evaluate cards better). It also, how their forums are set up, they keep one forum on one topic instead of them dropping off people's radar in 1-2 days. So it's easier to go deep into a topic. Instead of dozens of topics on Noise, there's one with ~900 posts, so you can see what people have tried and works well and ask questions.  My observation has been that players seem to migrate from BGG (really casual) to Reddit (causal/intermediate) to Stimhack (competitive); at least that's how it been for me. And a lot of players still have a presence in the other forums."
Netrunner,3e2cwz,tvaduva,0,Tue Jul 21 19:07:14 2015 UTC,"Play what you want and what you like. Try the same boring decks like all the others play, but try to make something on your own.

I hope they can leverage the unique position they're in to grow this game into something bigger.  If you're at a tournament and you require a TO to intervene regarding rules, is that time spent added to the end of the match? It would suck if you spend 10 minutes talking about a ruling and the game goes to time because of it.  Thanks"
Netrunner,3e0n6g,princessspacenix,3,Tue Jul 21 03:29:44 2015 UTC,"Just another reason we need the floor rules!  In MtG events, Judges will often give time extensions if a rules dispute or infraction takes longer than 30 seconds. I don't think there has ever been a case of a ruling taking 10 minutes, but in the case that it did, those players would be awarded extra time."
Netrunner,3e0n6g,TWA_Shielsy,2,Tue Jul 21 03:37:04 2015 UTC,"In short:  Yes, players should always get extra time. This question highlights exactly why consistency and reliability of rulings is integral to running a smooth event.  Every minute spent making a ruling is what's called a ""live"" minute;  one that causes the event to run longer.  Every other minute is called a ""dead"" minute,  and is irrelevant with respect to the events final finishing time.  So the general mantra is to be decisive in live time,  and talk deep mechanics and rules motivation in dead time."
Netrunner,3e0n6g,princessspacenix,3,Tue Jul 21 03:39:50 2015 UTC,That's really fascinating. I've only just gotten to the point where I've actually had to look up FAQs for a rule but because I'm learning I still really worry about going to time. Especially when I'm motivating the runner not to make runs or in decks with a low agenda density. I don't know what a good answer is :<
Netrunner,3e0pwj,sandweiche,12,Tue Jul 21 01:44:12 2015 UTC,Jinteki because I found it less intimidating as a beginner. Also it has never given me a reason to even consider octgn so that can only be good right?
Netrunner,3e0pwj,suhas20,11,Tue Jul 21 01:51:15 2015 UTC,"Try both.  Jinteki is web based, so there's pretty much no setup, and octgn is basically ""copy and paste a link, then hit install"".  I found Jinteki to be more automated, with a little more polish to the interface, and a little easier to pick up.  I found octgn was more like playing a physical game of netrunner, for me.  I had a little more control over every aspect, so while i had to do more, i could always make sure i was doing exactly what I should be.  Once I learned how to do everything, i found it a very capable and robust system with a lot of control.  I dont think you'll have trouble finding games on either system, i've never logged on for a game and not been able to find or create one.  Try them both, and see which you prefer.  If i had to use a metaphor, well, neither one's a sports car. Jinteki is that nice 2 door automatic coupe with gps you just get in and drive most of the time.  It's smooth, nice looking, and handles well and you dont need to do a lot of the work, but occasionaly you might have to backtrack a bit if the gps doesn't realize that road is actually a one way, and hopefully your copilot doesn't just blindly trust the gps.  and rarely you have to take it into the shop.  OCTGN is that 4 door stick shift you've been tweaking yourself, with a map.  If you know your car and where you're going, you're 100% set to have a speedy, enjoyable trip, even if you put a bit more work in with the manual, but if you're not fully used to the car or the route you need to take, you're going to need to spend some time looking over that map and fiddling with the engine.  I ended up liking the feel of octgn, but i know many people who ended up liking jinteki more.  either way, good luck Netrunning!"
Netrunner,3e0pwj,RestarttGaming,4,Tue Jul 21 02:54:38 2015 UTC,The analogy I heard that I found quite pleasing was that jinteki.net's like a Mac and OCTGN's like a PC.
Netrunner,3e0pwj,llama66613,5,Tue Jul 21 06:56:02 2015 UTC,I think OCTGN is much more like something that only runs on RedHat Linux or something.
Netrunner,3e0pwj,vampire0,4,Tue Jul 21 12:09:43 2015 UTC,"Perhaps ironically, Jinteki works much better on Linux than OCTGN does."
Netrunner,3e0pwj,Narcowski,4,Tue Jul 21 16:39:43 2015 UTC,"The main problem for me is I never managed to clear the insane hurdle that is ""try OCTGN"". You have to have the right operating system to even start with or spend an hour setting up a virtual machine, then you have to install OCTGN, then you have to find and install the Netrunner package and THEN you have to go find art-packs for all the damn expansions, which, BTW... aren't actually available on the internet in any specific location. You have to go scrounging around asking people on FB to send you the goods.  Compared to Jinteki, where I just opened it in the browser, pasted in deck from NRDB, and was good to go."

Netrunner,3e0pwj,RestarttGaming,13,Tue Jul 21 19:32:30 2015 UTC,"So, Jinteki's probably nicer for the most part.  For a while, it suffered from awful lag, but it's been cleaned up for the most part.  So it's simpler (usually,) can be accessed from any OS, and has about the same number of people.  HOWEVER, since OCTGN is a little less automated, people tend to know how to play Netrunner there.  Jinteki is simple enough that people just think you can plug and play (you can't, stuff happens weirdly all the time on Jinteki,) so when you wind up having to correct the client, there are a decent number of people who think you're cheating.  I've never had someone accuse me of cheating on OCTGN, but it happens at least once or twice a day on Jinteki.  I'm sure I'll start remembering people soon, but until then, I feel like some people playing on Jinteki tend to think they know how to play, but... don't.  On OCTGN, sometimes you find people that don't know how to play, but they admit it, and are happy to ask when something seems off."
Netrunner,3e0pwj,Stonar,9,Tue Jul 21 02:18:59 2015 UTC,"Wow, really? I play on jinteki.net every day and in several months I have never once had someone accuse me of cheating. It's bizarre that we've had such different experiences."

Netrunner,3e0pwj,vomii,4,Tue Jul 21 10:53:33 2015 UTC,I've had people rage quit when I give myself 6 clicks to install ice and draw as NEXT before starting my turn.  Or they give themselves clicks and start playing after I install the 3 bits of ice thinking my turn is done.
Netrunner,3e0pwj,zombiecommand,2,Tue Jul 21 10:58:30 2015 UTC,"I've had a few problems, but nothing too serious (or at least no one rage quitting because they thought I was cheating.)   My biggest complaint is with Blue Sun and Adonis Campaign. The easy way to do it, starting your turn to get the 3 creds and then bouncing it, is actually cheating since you're not supposed to see your mandatory draw before the bounce."
Netrunner,3e0pwj,SparklingEmoWendigo,2,Tue Jul 21 13:11:39 2015 UTC,"But there's no real way around that, because in real life you can choose to get the money then bounce as part of your start of turn trigger. Jinteki.net doesn't allow for that so you tend to just start your turn then bounce.   You can always ask that they just give themselves 3 credits and bounce before hitting start turn."
Netrunner,3e0pwj,zombiecommand,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:33:12 2015 UTC,"Exactly. When other people do it I don't mind, but I try to be diligent about it, which sometimes leads to some confusion."

Both rage quit.  Entirely possible I just got unlucky, I suppose."
Netrunner,3e0pwj,Stonar,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:17:30 2015 UTC,"Man that's really too bad.

Netrunner,3e0pwj,llama66613,4,Tue Jul 21 21:23:49 2015 UTC,"I do find that I have to remind players of rules on Jinteki, but straight up... not needing to do all that crap that is automated is half the reason to use Jinteki, not the other way around.  I really think that when you're on Jinteki, you're playing people who are distracted - like at work or something. No one installs OCTGN on a work machine, but popping it up in a tab in the browser? Yeah..."
Netrunner,3e0pwj,vampire0,2,Tue Jul 21 12:06:09 2015 UTC,"On the other hand, there is stuff that is  automated on OCTGN but not on Jinteki.   But at least Bad Pub and Stimhack credits where added recently to Jinteki."
Netrunner,3e0pwj,queueseven,3,Tue Jul 21 18:02:54 2015 UTC,"Just chiming in with the chorus of ""never had anyone accuse me of cheating."" My limited OCTGN experience has been pretty mediocre to bad, with other players frustrated that learning how to use the interface is tough. On Jinteki, perhaps because it's so clearly still in development, everyone has been friendly and able to roll with the punches when weird things happen or if one can't figure out how to do something in the game correctly. I never liked OCTGN and always felt like I was missing out on something -- Jinteki is a work in progress, but a wonderful one that I'm happy to spend a lot of time on."
Netrunner,3e0pwj,se4n,4,Tue Jul 21 19:59:51 2015 UTC,"Read the jinteki.net guide that was recently put on the wiki--it will help you understand the current limitations and rough edges of the system. Also have a look at the card implementation list, which is reasonably up-to-date. Most of the unimplemented cards have pretty straightforward manual workarounds, but unfortunately there are a few high-profile cards that are very problematic and won't work even with manual futzing--Crisium Grid is probably the worst offender right now.    If you want a higher quality player pool, OCTGN is probably where you want to be."

I was focusing more on using the interface, and figuring out how to do everything than I was focusing on playing.  Then I found j.net.  I was playing when quite a bit wasn't automated, and I still found it much easier than OCTGN.  I haven't turned back since."
Netrunner,3e0pwj,y-combinator,3,Tue Jul 21 03:30:19 2015 UTC,"Jinteki because I have a Mac and because it's a great way to get new players into the game! OCTGN is ugly as hell and overcomplicates many interactions in a way that can turn off new players --I think this is a fault of OCTGN as a platform, and no knock against the person who codes it all. However, it does seem to be faster and more responsive than Jinteki, whose main drawback is lag.  Also I LOVE the Jinteki.net deck builder! So easy to use!"
Netrunner,3e0pwj,weepinggorilla,4,Tue Jul 21 16:10:18 2015 UTC,"Jinteki, because my none of my home machines run Windows. Sure, I can load up OCTGN in WINE or in a VM, but  when the other option just works - mostly - why bother?"
Netrunner,3e0pwj,Narcowski,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:46:36 2015 UTC,"I can only speak for myself but Jinteki.net is AWFUL. It's very difficult to correct something when it goes wrong. In my very first game I suffered numerous issues including:    Street Peddler allowing me to install Djinn twice, for the same cost, and then only counting one of them while simultaneously reducing my memory to 0. I was able to partially correct this by throwing away a Djinn; but my memory reset to zero repeatedly throughout the match and I could never host or search with djinn -- ended up manually looking through R&D and dragging stuff out.   PW not triggering once at start-of-turn. Had to correct it by taking a free credit and re-using its abilty.   Medium not noticing that hivemind existed. In fact, thusfar NO card of mine has noticed that hivemind exists. WHat's worse, clicking hivemind asks ""where do you want to move virus tokens?"" That's NOT what Hivemind does!    It's made worse by the fact that I pulled off a 15-card access and had to take my NEH opponent's word for it that I saw 0 agendas. To say nothing of how I gained zero information about his deck composition or next X draws.  *) Hosting: No way to indicate hosting-targets prior to installation, particularly when it involved PW in between. The result was further memory loss on installation before retro-actively hosting it. Also made worse when Djinn refused to let me host it, and Jinteki.net did not offer me a way to visually demonstrate that ""it's hosted, k?"" by dragging cards around.  *) Appearance: Personal taste here - not a serious problem per se. But I vastly prefer OCTGN's use of the correct 'chit' images rather than just random numbers on cards to indicate advancement, power counters, virus counters, etc. It's instantly recognizable in a way that flaoting numbers just isn't.  All in all it appears that the automation on Jinteki.net is somewhere between 'somewhat' and 'significantly' worse than on OCTGN. Further, the 'direct control' available on OCTGN is not as readily available as on Jinteki.net. Most egregious is the inability to free-drag cards around in a ""simulated tabletop"" fashion.  I would say there are only two reasons to play on Jinteki.net instead of OCTGN: No installation required, and shalllower learning-curve from a hotkey/menu perspective. That being said, I was able to start playing on OCTGN A:NR immediately and was proficent in less than an hour thanks to a single page cheat sheet.   Let's not oversell the diffiuclty here.  -AHMAD"
Netrunner,3e0pwj,BountyHunterSAx,6,Tue Jul 21 05:25:44 2015 UTC,"Tokens on hosted Hiveminds, Mediums, et al are problematic right now--that's a bug in the hosting code that is a high priority to fix. Hivemind was an extremely tricky card to code, so the ""move tokens to another virus"" ability was a necessary workaround given the underlying architecture. Sorry.   Pretty much all of the cards that can host things have had an option added to them in the last 2 weeks that allows you to host something already installed--this is the workaround to enable hosting of items installed by something other than a click action (from SMC, Clone Chip, PW, etc). Obviously that feature could be misused, so communicate with an opponent via chat to indicate why you are using it that way."

Netrunner,3dzbpv,poorhaus,5,Mon Jul 20 19:23:28 2015 UTC,"New player here and I'd like to check my knowledge of the rules. Here are the rules questions posed in the article:   Sansan, Cyberdex, Clone Chip, and Clot are on the the table. Corp installs, advances, advances. After 2nd advance can the runner do anything before or during the Cyberdex/Sansan rez and agenda scoring?   Well, with Clot on the table, the corp would not be able to score the agenda this turn. The corp can rez Cyberdex and trash it, purging clot off the table, then score the agenda. The runner cannot respond as the corp has priority on paid ability windows during the corp's turn.   If you have negative handsize do you die instantly, or at the end of the turn?   End of turn. This is stated very conspicuously in the rule book.   Tollbooth plus Parasite plus Datasucker. I have 2 credits. Can I run Toolbooth and kill it?   No. The paid ability window happens after encountering the ice. When you encounter tollbooth, it ends the run unless you have 3 three credits. The run ends before the runner has a paid ability window.   Tollbooth plus Parasite plus Ice Carver. Do I pay the 3?   No. Ice Carver happens immediately on encounter. If this would bring the tollbooth to zero strength, it dies to parasite's constant ability. Since it is trashed we now cannot trigger the tollbooth's ""on encounter"" effect.   Tollbooth plus Parasite plus Scrubbed. Do I pay the 3?   No. Scrubbed happens at the same speed as Ice Carver. As long as this is the first Ice encountered this turn and it brings the tollbooth to zero strength, the ruling above applies.   What happens with 2 Daily Business Shows out?   Draw three cards, put two on the bottom of R&D.   Can I use Panic Button after the runner declares that they will access?   Yes, there is a window at 4.3 after the runner has decided they will be accessing.   What happens with 2 Security Testing targeting the same server?   Only one instance can trigger. It would work the same as if you had a single card. ""The first time you make a successful run on that server this turn, instead of accessing cards, gain 2credit.""  Please let me know if I'm wrong! Thanks!"

Infiltration will ruin your day without Zaibatsu Loyalty, and Share! is the trap card.  You'll also want Datamine. While 1 net damage may not seem like much, Datamine is a ""trap"" and not a codegate, barrier, or sentry. this means that, from the Coreset, only Crypsis can break it. A Chum in front of a Datamine is a solid 4 net damage.   I don't know if you need Shadow, since you don't have anything to use the tag for. That might be something worth swapping out."

They can just draw up to have a large enough hand to survive going through the neural katana (or a non-barrier behind a chum) or pay to clear the tag from shadow after the run ends.

Netrunner,3dy1yr,RestarttGaming,5,Mon Jul 20 13:58:19 2015 UTC,"For the lazy, here's the top comment of that thread by u/RestarttGaming.  Lots of really good ideas here.   Eve campaign and Adonis campaign and private contacts get more money. Draco can get more counters. Elizabeth mills removes more bad pub It can protect ice from being trashed by parasite until you clear virus (parasite stays and builds counters, but the ice isn't trashed until it's rezzed ) It can protect ice from cutlery mid run. It can let you reset chimera when the runner thinks they can install the right program then get through. You can de-rez all ice except mother goddess to make it untyped. It can protect things from unregistered 35 if done before the runners turn. It can let you rez a unique card in another server without trashing it the original, like having a caprice on R&D and a remote. Basically anything with an effect on rez or anything that depends on ice being rezzed, like cutlery. You can use breaker bay grid to rez something expensive, then derez your breaker bay to allow you to use blue sun to bounce that expensive thing for full cost (normally blue sun would use the reduced cost if breaker bay was still rezzed, unless you spent a turn bouncing breaker bay first)   Also, /u/Lastro had this delightful observation:   I would add to the list, saving an off the grid. Derez right before the run is successful on HQ, rez after the end of the run.   A few other thoughts:  It can protect people from the handgun, if Unregistered S&W ever becomes popular/necessary.  Also, if Data and Destiny does, in fact, have a NBN ID with the ability ""Runner loses 1c every time an advertisement is rezzed"" then this card could become downright nasty."
Netrunner,3dy1yr,Bwob,2,Mon Jul 20 17:39:13 2015 UTC,It can let you reset chimera when the runner thinks they can install the right program then get through.   Are you sure? I think Chimera creates a constant effect (much like Tinkering or the Kit ID) which will cause the second rezzing of Chimera to still have the type from the first rez.  I'm stupid.
Netrunner,3dy1yr,Salindurthas,3,Tue Jul 21 02:35:55 2015 UTC,Chimera gains that subtype until derezzed.
Netrunner,3dy1yr,musingly,2,Tue Jul 21 04:13:25 2015 UTC,Another lame possibility: derez stuff during an Account Siphon run so you have somewhere to dump your remaining credits and deny the runner any benefit.  Edit: And another: reuse Haas Arcology AI!  Edit: And another! Remove subtypes from Mother Goddess.
Netrunner,3dy1yr,musingly,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:13:06 2015 UTC,"And someone else mentioned derezzing satellite grid mid run in a server with morph ice to match their worst breaker.  Well take it one further, still in blue sun, and use satellite grid to rez constellation ice cheaper and then mid run derez it to change the type of the morph ice, and now that satellite grid is derezed, bounce constellation ice with blue sun for more money since the space ices cost will go back up ( bonus points if you constellation protocol or trick of light other counters off before you bounce)"

Netrunner,3dy1yr,Kandiru,2,Mon Jul 20 13:54:31 2015 UTC,"I think this really has to be compared to Thomas Haas. Both are ""traps"" which give you some benefit instead of hurting the runner, but they can both be used to bait a run and then you pop the ability before they access.  Most of the time gaining 3C from Thomas will be better, but de-rezzing an adonis is worth a lot of credits if you can keep it alive for the full duration.   Unusual uses also involve de-rezzing Arcology AI so you can advance it again."

Best luck was playing stealth andy, losing all my breakers, my opponent being way ahead and just scoring out, it was 6-0 in his favour and he has 8 or so agendas in the deck (in total), with the last one he needs just going down into the scoring remote, and presumably 5 still left in a reasonably sized deck. I inside job on R&D and click through whatever bioroid ice I can't afford to not break, see three cards (two RDIs), score 8 agenda points. Lesson is always play to your outs xD"

Some highlights:   Playing CT Stimshop vs. a funky RP, corp has IAA the winning agenda into a remote I can't get into at all. I'm at 5 points and the only things left in R&D that will win me the game are two TFPs, and there is a Caprice there, with a bunch of expensive ICE in front. I have 2 RDIs, so I get money and YOLO Stimhack R&D last click. I win the Caprice psi game, and the first card is TFP...and I lose the psi game. But the 3rd card is the other TFP and I won that psi game! As ETF, first time playing against Headlock Reina, and I can't find any ICE at all. He hasn't gotten a lamprey down yet, so I Hail Mary biotic ABT, fire it, and get NEXT Bronze, NEXT Bronze, Mother Goddess, which saves me the game. Playing Leela against RP, the corp mulls and first turn gifts me a had of 2 Nisei Mk II and an NAPD, and ETR ICE, and an operation, and 3rd click installs the ICE on HQ. Of course, I run R&D, pull a Nisei, bounce the ICE, and run HQ 3 times and steal the rest of the agendas in all 3 runs to win on my first turn."

Run R&D again and score a Posted Bounty.  Worst Luck (but my best personal victory): Less than a week ago, I was playing a new Blue Sun build, against Noise. I opened with a few cheap pieces of ice, and an Underway Renovation. I quickly shored up my centrals on turn one, then installed and just started advancing the agenda like mad behind an Ice Wall. I managed to ACTUALLY REVERSE MILL NOISE!!! Near the end of the game, he was completely out of cards and recursion. I was holding many agendas in my HQ safely, he runs R&D, sees two cards, and pulls the only 2 pointer left in my deck for the win, with 25 cards and 4 points total left in my deck.  It was still worth it. Definitely an Achievement Unlocked for sure."

Playing a standard Jinteki RP, and mulligan into 3 agendas. Mandatory draw a 4th... 1 ice, 1 econ card.   I need Jackson or I die! Gotta play it cool.. I know I'll not ICE HQ, ice on R&D, play the econ. Draw a card... Agenda yay!  By luck, the Leela I'm versing sets up shop this round, and among other things puts down a Security Testing. I spend the next 2 rounds sweating bullets, searching for SOMETHING not an agenda, while trying not to make it too obvious I have a hand full of trash. Lucky for me he made HQ the testing server for a couple rounds...  Lost that one badly, but not quickly. Definitely the least lucky game I've ever had."

He hits a Kitsune, I show him a Snare. Another Snare was sitting on board and he was holding two cards, so he figured he could afford to access his single card. Topdecked a Snare.  Unlucky: last round of Swiss at regionals last Saturday. My Kate deck had of its programs except for Snowball in the bottom 1/4 of the deck. No SMC, no Mimic, no Zuul, and definitely no Faust.

Netrunner,3dxosx,Vysetron,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:12:27 2015 UTC,"I can't think of any interesting examples of bad luck but I think one of my more interesting stories of luck was at Nationals this year.  I was playing Valencia versus NEH. Now I knew to be careful against NEH after encountering Butchershop in regionals (a game in which I wasn't careful and played two IHW early on and then chose to steal an unadvanced, unprotected NAPD... while they had a bad pub). Or so I thought. See I hadn't seen anything that made me think my opponent was on Butchershop. They had tried to score out an Astro and a breaking news, both of which I stole, and all I saw made me think they were on Astrobiotics. So I let my guard down, play my IHW and continue to greedily steal. They have a Wraparound on both R&D and the server they've been trying to score out of and I have one counter left on my D4V1D. I've got another in hand so I try to bait him into using that server again by spending it on an R&D run. He installs and advances and I think that I've got him. Only as it turns out he was the one baiting me and the breaking news was a trap for a midseasons kill next turn. At this point I'm completely unaware of this and wondering what to do with my last two clicks (having spent one installing a fresh David and another running the breaking news). I figure what the hey, I've got two David counters left so I'll check R&D. An astro off the top puts me to six points so I figure it can't hurt to go in again. Beale off the top.  It's at this point my opponent reveals I would have been dead next turn had I not just skimmed four points off R&D. I really dodged a bullet that day."

I wasn't too worried, as my opponent didn't have any breakers out at the time, and my HQ was iced up.  On the opponents turn, he managed to put in an icebreaker that gave him access to HQ and tried poking in there a few times.  Thankfully he never got access to the GT agenda, and I went on to install it next turn into my scoring remote, sort out cash for the remainder of the turn, and then score it out through advances thanks to my monster glacier server over the next 3 turns after that."

My turn was Sure Gamble, install SMC, run the remote... it's Government Takeover. Lucky break was my last click: Sure Gamble. The only card that could have saved me in my deck aside from the 1-of Plascrete carapace. On his turn he drew, sighed at his cards and played Punitive anyway. If he'd gotten another Hedge or any econ he'd have had enough to murder me turn two. As it was, his nine credits got him a trace 11 and I beat it with a credit to spare and six points in the bank.  Unluckiest? Saturday at ANRPC Wausau, playing against NEH their turn one was Hedge, ICE HQ, install remote (notice a pattern?). My turn one was install Desperado, Dirty Laundry RnD (think I saw NAPD. Not gonna steal that turn one against NEH), draw card, then Dirty Laundry the remote. I figure I'll make some money and maybe trash DBS. It's TGTBT, instead.

Netrunner,3dyb9g,kata124,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:16:58 2015 UTC,"MU is usually ok. I have my 3 main breakers (Faerie, Cerberus and Corroder) and then 1-2 others, often a Crescentus and whatever B&E breaker I need for that run. Sometimes I'll have 2 B&E breakers if I have a clone chip and a crescentus in the heap so that I can burn a B&E breaker on taxing ICE (Lotus field, Tollbooth, etc) and then Clone Chip in Crescentus to shut it down immediately. Draw 3 cards, pay nothing and derez ICE? Yes please :)  I had a 1-of Dyson in the deck in case I wanted to turtle up and go to cloud, but I don't think it's necessary. This deck is burning its B&E breakers for the 4-5 strength taxers, not trying to get them up to curtain wall level. I'm totally happy to use Corroder on Curtain Wall if I know I can crescentus it right away and deny Blue Sun their money from it. I think I'd want to hit more into the 6 strength B&E range if I was playing a lot of Red Coats, but that seems to have fallen off the meta. RP's high strength cards are Tollbooth and Susan, and 5 strength is definitely in range for B&E if I've got the clone chip crescentus play and Susan is pretty cheap to break with Faerie (especially if you Crescentus it).  The ideal rig is the 3 breakers and then either 2 different B&E and a Crescentus in the heap, or Crescentus + whatever B&E I need to break the server I want to get into that turn :) Usually run at 4 mem full and install a card as I prepare for a run, often on HQ to make the siphon pay me and cost the corp, then allow me to try for their remote with me rich and them poor. Gives the psi games a new dynamic when the corp is worried about losing money on it and you're not."
Netrunner,3dyb9g,kata124,2,Mon Jul 20 16:18:29 2015 UTC,Very interesting. I forget that the B&E work even when you don't have 2 link. A 5 strength barrier/codegate breaker for 1 is pretty strong.

I mean heck - not only is it the ultimate safe facechecking tool, it ALSO lets you jack out during windows you can't otherwise normally jack out of.  Did you just run on a suspicious remote, and then, after you declared that yes, you would access, they suddenly rezzed some Dedicated Response Teams?  Oh well!  Poof, run is ended, no potentially game-ending encounters with a snare for you!  Inazuma?  Whatever.  Heck, I think it even lets you get out of chum safely, since you can end the run after they rez the ice, but before you actually encounter it.  (And of course it completely poops on Whirlpool, Port Anston Grid, and Labrynthine Servers, and Ancestral Imager, if anyone ever played those.)

Let it ETR. Archer going to Arch? ETR.  If it worked like Nasir's ability it'd be broken. Fully neutering the scariest type of ICE with almost no cost? You wouldn't see Sentries anymore.  But yeah, not running until you get a sentry breaker if you have other programs is the best idea for most runners. Just like how running without a decoder installed is fine but is silly for Kit. Different runners have different playstyles.  But yeah, cards have downsides. Imagine that! If they're running only gearcheck sentries such as Guard then yeah, not so grand.  Of course...

Edit: It's also pretty horrible against Lancelot, too, because you'll still get hit by the additional Grail.  It'd be slightly better if it was a may (or if it was a Snitch-like effect for Sentries only), but it'd still have limited use and still demand other bonuses. This doesn't allow for running pre-Killer, you can do that already, it means you won't get in without a Killer, which you could otherwise do (and it's important for Criminals to be able to get in without breakers), and Sentries cost more to break.

Yes, sure, in this extremely niche situation where you're playing Torch in Criminal against a deck with Archer in it, I'm certain it does. However, that small upside isn't worth the slew of downsides the ID offers. Paying one more per turn is massive. It's the sort of thing that makes Desperado so good, the small one-credit efficiencies.  It sounds small to only have to pay one more per turn, but it's really not. The numbers add up, and Criminal's already a faction that's strapped for cash as-is.  I'm not saying the ID ability is never good, I'm saying it's a detriment more than a benefit. You can make niche scenarios where it saves your bacon (and I'm sure it can!), but most of the time it just makes runs cost one more and that's horrible.

If I designed a Crim console I'd be leery of making it on par with Desperado. This is a playstyle ID, similar to Noise, Ian, and Leela. It would allow newer players to run more, and experienced players to run even more aggressively.  Right now Crim is bottom tier. No use denying that.

Chat updates: even if you're in a game you will continue to receive chat updates. Chat can either be completely dead or very active, but each update should only be a few kb. Game updates: every single action taken will send the entire game state back to your client. That will start at ~35kb and can only grow over time.

Film Critic completely negates any risk for the runner in accessing R&D, HQ or a remote (in terms of stealing an agenda, obviously ambushes are still a thing).  Film Critic will make kill decks move away from Midseasons, you're right. SEA Source will likely make a comeback, but I think that's a good thing. I don't want kill decks to be gone from the meta, but Midseasons felt like it was WAY too easy for them. SEA Source requires less of an econ advantage for the runner to beat, but is easier for the Corp to play. Interactivity! Plus, if the corp wants to setup the more reliable traffic/scorch, they have to put more effort into it, rather than just landing a midseasons, since SEA Source only gives one tag.  Overall I think this will be a good change. Butchershop is just able to position itself so well by being able to easily score out using the best agenda in the game if the runner decides to be cautious and money up, and can easily kill the runner if they get too aggressive. Knocking them down a peg will make the deck more fun and interactive to play against.  Oh I also forgot, it looks like Critic is only going to be 1 influence.

Netrunner,3dvaaa,alexbaha,1 point,Mon Jul 20 08:37:35 2015 UTC,"I think we broadly agree. The only point I really wanted to make is that ""Click 1 SEA Source, click 2 Scorched Earth, click 3 Scorched Earth"" isn't really a feasible threat against Anarchs anymore. Of course, that's not to say Anarchs can't die. NBN has several good alternatives. Butchershop is one, and Breaking News and/or Data Raven seems like it should be another.  What I am concerned about is what Weyland should do. I think Posted Bounty isn't strong enough anymore, but Snare!, Data Raven and Biotic Labor could all potentially work, the latter turning on triple Scorched. Snare! and Data Raven can both be played around by the Runner, though, so I don't know how well it can work."

Netrunner,3dvaaa,se4n,2,Sun Jul 19 23:33:31 2015 UTC,"Pro Tip: remember that you get 1 tag on Midseaons for every point they out-trace you by. This means you can either pay 1 credit more on the trace now (even if you can't beat the whole thing) instead of paying 2 credits and a click later to drop that same tag.   Go broke if you have a means of coming back with more money next turn (Opus is great for this). You will dig yourself out of tag hell much faster if you bite the bullet and reduce that trace now rather than keeping the money for ""other things"" and get buried. My first game of the last store championship I played (my second tourney ever) I dug out of 2 Midseasons like this. Plascretes bought me enough time to do it, and within a turn or so of each Midseason, I was clear again.  Remember, they can only Midseasons you so many times. If they get you when you steal agenda #2 (lets say putting you at 4 or 5 points), you could potentially win the game before they get another one off."

Netrunner,3dw3ln,zojbo,5,Mon Jul 20 00:45:45 2015 UTC,"I've actually played around with a deck somewhat like that!  I liked it a lot.  Never-advance PE is an interesting archetype, but I think it can work.  Some sugestions:   Don't feel like you have to use nothing but 1-pointers.  Brain trust is a perfectly good agenda in this deck, since you can still score it from nothing.  Having it hard to tell how many turns you are from winning is always a good thing. Brain damage!  If you have some cheap ice, throw in some edge-of-worlds.  If your'e running never-advance, they can get terrifying.  And 1-2 brain damage is almost always worth the 3c. Cerebral Casts - it's a grossly underrated card, but it is a lot of fun in jinteki PE.  Brain damage is almost never something people want to take, especially if your deck has snares.  But tags can be troublesome, especially if they have Katie Jones or other high-value resources. Which brings us to...  Scorched Earth!  What else are you going to use all that influence on?  And it combos REALLY WELL with all that brain damage from cerebral casts and edge of world.   I was playing around with this right when H&P came out, and it seemed quite workable.  Give it a try, and see if you don't get a few more flatline kills!"

Netrunner,3dw3ln,BountyHunterSAx,2,Mon Jul 20 03:16:49 2015 UTC,"My 2 cents:  I'm working on an Argus Security decklist with the same idea - run a ton of agendas and use the cost of stealing them as a tax. One of the things I'm trying to use for economy are assets such as melange mining corp and capital investors but I keep thinking that they'll be a huge drawback if I hand the runner to much bad publicity.  In terms of ice I'm running a mixture of taxing ice (Eli), gear checks, (enigma/ice wall), and some taxing sentries (Archer, Errand boy, Data raven) that don't necessarily end the run. I think the premise of the deck definitely has promise and I agree on a lot of your points - chronos project seems good/ advanceable traps seem bad/ 3/2 agendas still seem worthwhile (I'm running project atlas)."

Netrunner,3dw3ln,TMN8R,2,Mon Jul 20 21:14:02 2015 UTC,"The biggest issue/ ""jankiness"" I see in this deck is that it seems really easy to just steal 1-2 agendas, recover. Steal 1-2 agendas, recover. Steal 2-3 agendas, win.  Running R&D, particularly with medium or Legwork, would just be devastating. Basically go into full anti-trapteki mode and treat your hand as little more than glorified hit-points except as necessary, ya'know?  Plenty of other Shock!-ing ways to 'zap' people without needing to turn half your deck into vulnerabilities.  -AHMAD"
Netrunner,3dw3ln,BountyHunterSAx,0,Mon Jul 20 03:19:27 2015 UTC,"Yes, I expected this problem to be quite severe. With no additional teeth you're right, it's pretty problematic. But it's not actually as bad as you would think. First of all, completely in theory, this deck can be pretty quick to score out. Put down a Gila, score it after click 1 of turn 2, then click on it. Then 12 turns of clockwork later, you win. It could be a lot faster, potentially as little as 6 turns after the initial 2, if you have some 3/2s included as well.  More realistically, the plan is something like this, except with a bit more time spent on ice:  Turn 1: Get an ETR ice on R&D, HQ, and a remote.  Turn 2: Install a Melange. Do something with the other two clicks; if the runner can't break your ice yet, installing another ETR and a Gila would be good.  Turn 3: Melange. (This is mostly to help pay for ice.)  Turn 4 or 5: score the Gila (maybe doing ice or econ in the middle)  Ideally every two turns thereafter: install, Gila, score.   This is pretty quick, if they are having to get the economy to get into your centrals and to draw back from your zaps (and possibly your Snares/Shocks/etc.)"
Netrunner,3dw3ln,BountyHunterSAx,3,Mon Jul 20 03:44:59 2015 UTC,"This is not pretty quick. I know it sounds pretty quick, but it's not. Think of it this way. Say everything you pray for happens, to win by scoring out (NOT flatlining):  Turn 1-4 (setup, initial cash) Turn 5-install Turn 6-adv. score Turn 7-install Turn 8-adv. score Turn 9-install Turn 10-adv. score ---> You have 3-4 points. Assuming the runner didn't interrupt you. Or steal any of your stuff. Or siphon you even once. Or start medium-locking you. And I'm not talking tier-1 tournament-winning runner here; even a basic core-gabe could pull it off.  For point of reference? By turn 5 my Kate deck (which I have taken to tournaments) will have a full stealth-rig set up.  For way of comparison, by turn 7-10 my ""janky"" Valencia deck will be ready for a 16-30 access run on R&D [against most corps. Probably will be going off sooner and for less against this deck . . and with IHW for safety.]  The reason I say this is that I've fought a deck like this out of Argus Security. A deck that ran lots and lots of agendas, plenty of scorch/traffic-accident if I decided to go 'tagme'. . .and otherwise dealt two meat damage per steal. The problem inevitably is that 7 points takes WAYYY less time to steal than it does to score.  -AHMAD"
Netrunner,3dw3ln,BountyHunterSAx,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:01:01 2015 UTC,"It's not quick relative to robust (not even good, just robust) runner decks, I agree, and it's not quick relative to a truly fast corp like Astrotrain. I just meant that it's quicker than it sounds at first, basically because if left alone, it can churn out an agenda every other turn, indefinitely, with no FA tools and no vulnerable economy on the board. At first it sounds much slower even than that.  Again, as I said in the OP, I know this is jank, and I should really even say that I know it is bad jank (whereas ""good"" jank is generally very strong provided its combo comes together, but the combo is hard to draw). I'm just interested in tweaks to create slightly better jank.  The point about the runner being able to cripple this deck with R&D lock or siphon is appreciated."
Netrunner,3dw3ln,ProphetOfCod,2,Mon Jul 20 04:31:56 2015 UTC,":). Fair enough.  Then, in the spirit of enjoying the bad-jankiness of it, let's embrace what this deck does well: constantly 'slow' a runner by plink-taxing and force them to not play their usual game.  Without being able to 'legitimately' present a scoring-out threat you're gonna have a hard time winning unless you are able to commit to the flatline plan, yes?  Let's think of ways to continue to slow a runner, amplify the plink-tax plan, and maybe a serious win condtion.  Snares seem like an easy first point. They run R&D knowing they're gonna take 1 damage to steal. If they hit a snare, that number jumps to '3'. Hold the scorch in hand and now they need to remove a tag too. Neural EMP means they can't end the turn 0 cards. Or Neural x2 to threaten to do it twice.  Fetal AI is another clear choice. A free 'snare' that costs 2creds to steal -- don't worry about scoring it; it's just there to be more punishing.   Ice-wise, yagura and pup. Maybe a cortex lock. You dont have enough money to really support 'real' ice,  And pup/yagura charge 2c a pop for the low low price of just 1 to rez each.  Hokusai Grid on R&D?  -AHMAD"

Netrunner,3dw3ln,Delha,1 point,Mon Jul 20 05:16:52 2015 UTC,"I used to play such a deck, and it's fun and wacky but had serious problems. The first is deck space: you're limiting yourself a lot by having so many agendas because now you have less space for everything else. The first thing I'd suggest is Fetal AI. It locks up an extra point in each agenda while actually putting out more net damage than 2 1-pointers. The Future Perfect similarly locks up points in a hard-to-steal agenda, giving you extra card slots with little additional risk.  Your deck needs to kill or threaten the kill in order to work. Disrupting the runner can have pretty profound effects on the course of the game, but in the end you're going to get dunked on points-wise. Philotic seems like your one path to the kill right now, but you need some more. Neural EMPs and Snare + Scorched Earth are good at punishing a runner who runs late in their turn and can't recover enough. If you're going never advance Psychic Field is good too.  Unfortunately, your counterplay is very simple. If you install either Net Shield or Feedback Filter, or run first click and draw up the rest, there's not much a deck like this can do without more deadly traps. By the time there is a real play to be made, the runner already has the points."

I threw this together for some casual games few months back, ended up enjoying it quite a bit.  First and foremost, these games are a race. The goal is simply to make the runner less efficient at stealing than you are at scoring. They should be constantly taking damage, making them waste clicks on replacing lost tools (or just to keep their hand size up), while you continue pushing through an agenda every 1.5 turns or so. Popups & Shadows tend to go on R&D or your scoring server, since those places see the most action. Those, along with Gila Hands tend to be your primary econ.   This list likes to install things, then act on the turn following. I found that I often followed the pattern of installing then taking money (hopefully via Gila), even when I had a rezzed SanSan and could have scored from hand. This sets up the turns where you plan to drop in Edge of World or Melange, and also prevents Clot shenanigans.  So long as you’re scoring for 2-3 cred a pop, while the runner is paying 4-5 credits each, you should come out ahead. That minor difference combined with the constant trickle of net damage from stealing, scoring, hitting Shocks in HQ/R&D… All of that should help you win the race. You’re never actively forcing a kill, but if the runner is pushing too hard too fast, False Lead, House of Knives, and Neural EMP are all there to capitalize if the opportunity arises. Philotic via SanSan can also often kill out of nowhere. With so many agendas in the deck and so much net damage floating around, you’ve almost always got something else to score while waiting for chance to kill with this.  Possible Changes: Fetal -> Braintrust: I took the former for the damage and extra steal cost. I almost never tried to score it, and it was in many ways, Shocks #4-6. Braintrust could be good in that you pressure the win faster, forcing them to run more recklessly and risking flatline.  No Snare: It’s expensive and you very often can’t afford to pay the trigger anyway.  Edge of World: These should probably come out. I never landed one, and you’d probably be better off with PAD Campaigns or some other econ. Celebrity Gift might work here. At the very least, cut to 1 or 2.  SanSan: Even though you’re not scoring from hand, saving a click lets you score then drop in a new agenda for the following turn. Scoring every turn instead of every other turn is obviously a big deal. That said, NeoTokyo Grid provides the same trash costs and same econ benefit, at a much lower rez cost. That might be enough to let you afford Snares again. The extra influence could probably be well spent on Peak Efficiency or some other econ. I could also see the cheap bioroids (Eli, Viktor 1.0) working."

You had all your All-Nighters out, right? 3 more.   I think that's 43 clicks. I think the answer is obvious with what to do with them: Wait until the corp has 41 cards in HQ and do a Demolition Run. Then, run into Archives and gain 1 million agenda points.  EDIT: Forgot Amped Up. 3x2 = 6 clicks. 3x Stim Dealer = 3 clicks. Joshua B = 1 click.  That's 53 unconditional clicks."

Hyperdriver removes itself from the game when you use it.  Presumably to prevent exactly this sort of shenanigans.  (Also you can only sacrifice it at the start of the turn.)

What can you do with a 7 click turn? Install a lot of stuff for a surprise attack. Gain a lot of money via Magnum Opus or a ton of events. Do a massive setup turn with draw and econ.  Notoriety x3, one of which you can even Same Old Thing! Escher + Tinkerings for an easy remote break. Destroy multiple upgrades with Unregistered S&W. Wanton Destruction for their entire hand. 5 Medium runs followed by a Planned Assault Showing Off. Install Angel Arena and handcraft your perfect grip.   I see a lot of synergy with a massive handsize build where you have ALL the tools and then do a massive one hit turn.   This also significantly increases the benefit of running Leprechaun instead of / alongside regular Memchips because you can now host 4-6 MU of programs for a single 2 cost one MU card. Hell, because Hyperdriver is not unique, a single Leprechaun can nest a series of Leprechauns and Hyperdrivers and you could have a THIRTEEN CLICK TURN.

Netrunner,3ducf0,char2,2,Mon Jul 20 04:55:45 2015 UTC,"The concept of this card is sweet, but its impact is questionable.  It all comes down to click compression. Runners absolutely love click compression, but when you go deeper runners love click compression that consistently works over a period of turns resulting in a significant number of additional clicks.  Professional contacts, symmetrical visage, Kati Jones, Magnum Opus, Desperado, Medium, these are all examples of cards that provide passive, reliable click compression for the runner.  Hyperdriver is a conditional burst of clicks. It's not really what most runners are looking for when we think of click compression. To that end, it seems like it's more of a combo card.  As an example, let's take a look at the idea that most people put forward for use with Hyperdriver: Magnum Opus. First off, you need to have 5 MU to even run this particular combination. Alright, that means you've either installed some form of MU buff or you have no breakers (or are using cloud breakers I guess, ick), or you're running CT and still have no breakers/are using cloud breakers. You can't really afford to let this thing hang around clogging up so much MU, so you likely remove it on your next turn. This gives you a 7 click turn with Opus which lets you get 14 credits, if that's all you do with it.  That honestly doesn't seem like fantastic value for the setup you're going through. 14 credits from a single turn is awesome, don't get me wrong but the beauty of Opus is that it lets you take a tempo hit to be able to set up a bit faster in the mid game and have a solid economic engine into the late. What you're doing here is basically taking a bigger tempo hit to get proportional rewards. But this time it requires two cards rather than one.  Even if you want to use this to setup, then you can't use more of them because your MU is now being taken up by breakers. Which means you're either running one or two dead cards in your deck, or you're burning SMC to find Hyperdriver, which costs three and can't be used until next turn... Ugh.  The best case scenario I can think of for this card is to vamp the corp and then run rampant over their servers for a turn. Combined with run based economy and maybe some multi-access, this could be a good basis for a combo deck, but that does mean you're looking at being able to vamp the corp, then still be able to pay for your accesses and multi-access etc.  One thing that I've heard as a good idea for it is in Kate, as an early means to set up. It comes down for free, then gives you a gigantic turn in which you can use your pro-co/ID ability to really set up your rig. A seven click turn for Kate means she could play Lucky Find/Gamble and still have a number of clicks left to pro-co and/or install hardware and programs. Additionally, because she runs Astrolabe, she typically has 5 MU, and due to her event based econ, she can have two breakers/programs installed AND be able to use Hyperdriver, which means it can theoretically be used in the mid-game to recover, or set up a game-winning turn. It also synergises well with her recursion, because overwriting her ladies/Atman/CC is something that she may want to do."
Netrunner,3ducf0,thesreynatwork,2,Sun Jul 19 22:01:31 2015 UTC,"Hyperdriver is very much a combo card, and I love it! I've been playtesting a deck that vamps the Corp to 0, then goes in for a double Medium dig to finish the game. And it works about 70% of the time. Hyperdriver sets up for one big, epic turn, but also gives some extra versatility just in case you need some extra clicks before the combo is set up. In one game, I popped one early to get enough money to waltz into an RP remote and steal a Nisei that would have given me trouble later. A couple turns later, the combo was ready and I finished it off in R&D. It's certainly not tier 1, nor even tier 1.5 because there are some cards that completely shut it down, such as Cyberdex Virus Suite, but it's an absolute blast to play and can be downright stupid if the Corp doesn't manage to stop it."

She only needs one breaker early game, and typically uses Kati as econ, so it seems like a perfect slot. Might be workable in a Paintbrush/Tinkering situation. And you don't even need extra MU; even if you installed Paintbrush/SMC from hand afterwards, you're still netting 2 clicks that turn (or to be more precise, 'banking' 2 clicks from early game)"
Netrunner,3ducf0,tetristhemovie,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:19:53 2015 UTC,"I like the concept of this card but I'm having a hard time finding any real uses out of it. Lets assume you're trying to use it as a money generator. Magnum is the biggest unless your doing some Crazy Desperado/sec testing/Au Revoir.    so your spending a click to get it out and gaining 3 later. and it costs 1 to install. so basicly your using a 3 MU program to gain 3 credits. using your 2 mu program of Magnum.  So its not money, or you could just sure gamble and have a better profit. So what other instances would a burst of clicks be helpful.    Notoriety decks would be useful here I guess to let you play more of them in one turn Turns with lots of runs, but we are sharper so unless we import showing off/medium/nerveagent/keyhole/dataleak/Demolition run running a bunch of times into the same server is ehh. Combining lots of click items into one turn. for example Dayjob/luckyfind -> run on a White tree deck you need more clicks to use for lots of runs.   Or the best option in Shaper     Using ""untill end of turn"" items in a Better turn, Tinkering, London library/LLDS Processor to make a highly effective turn rather then ""install Overmind - run - run - bounce overmind"""

Netrunner,3dwgrb,Cusengan,8,Mon Jul 20 02:44:00 2015 UTC,"First of all, by choosing astrobiotics, you're accepting that you will lose most games you play against Kate players who know what they're doing. Don't try to use tricks like ""waiting just long enough without explicitly asking for runner actions before playing your SFSS""; it will just lead to feel-bad situations and judge calls where the judge has nothing to go on and decides randomly and gives you a warning. Instead get into the habit of asking ""Install, any action?"" at times when the runner shouldn't clot you, to throw them off and not give tells. Also look for chances to alter your play the same way, like installing jackson on a sansan behind some ice.  Don't expect CVS to win the game for you. It's expensive, fragile, and an extra combo card you have to assemble repeatedly. Occasionally you'll be able to score a first or second agenda with it when kate is still setting up but by the end game you should expect a good kate player to sniff out any installed CVSes. You might be able to get away with that if you got it behind a piece of ice that requires a clone chip to get past, i.e., ichi. But I mostly think of it as a tool for the anarch matchup (mostly because of how well it pairs up with ichi); if I expected to play only kates, I'd just play a 3rd SFSS. Actually, play the 3rd SFSS no matter what (cutting a wraparound).  The way you beat kate is by winning both the gear-check tempo war in the beginning of the game and the clone chip war at the end of the game. A good kate player will prioritize her set-up over checking every remote in the opening, aiming for a juicy legwork and an unbreakable remote-lock in the endgame. A bad kate player will try to clot your first astroscript even if it has 2 ice in front of it, and then find herself submitting to 2 gear checks and going broke. If you can figure out which type of kate your opponent is, you can put them on the back foot by, for example, rushing to 4 points behind a taxing tollbooth remote, or scoring your NAPD when paying the gear-checks will put her under 4 credits while accessing, respectively. Always always always put ice on your remote.  Finally, consider dropping to 1 biotic if you expect to face no criminals whatsoever. Play a 2nd ichi and either a 3rd architect or a 1st ash instead. You will auto lose your crim matchups but the biotic is basically useless against kate (too easy to clot) and anarchs as well (you don't wanna pay to fast advance when it doesn't force them to match you by trashing sansan, because you need that money to defend against medium)."

Netrunner,3dwgrb,bblum,2,Mon Jul 20 19:30:55 2015 UTC,"It seems about as good as CVS against kate, or maybe a little bit better. Cheaper and hardier trash cost but slightly narrower conditions for when it will work. I haven't tested it. Not nearly as good against anarchs, though (unless you go for that anti-maxx blacklist+grail+powershutdown build I've seen floating around which just seems worse overall)."
Netrunner,3dwgrb,bblum,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:33:05 2015 UTC,Also why the 3rd ssfs? I thought two was fine but you make it sound mandatory
Netrunner,3dwgrb,thefalseidol,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:46:43 2015 UTC,"Two is ok, but it's your best tool against clot. You have to play some shell games with installing on your sansan, and when they guess wrong and don't clot you, you need to actually have it to punish.  I also really like it against anarch for rushing/tempo purposes. It lets you set up 2 ice on your scoring remote a turn or so quicker. On paper the card is only worth 2 credits but the intangible tempo boost is usually worth 1-2 more.  I think it's ok to cut the 15th ice for it (from my Philly list) because with 2 tollbooths and an ichi (or 1x and 2x if you've cut the 2nd biotic) there are enough ice beefy enough to count as 2 ice when you get them."

Netrunner,3dwgrb,JohnQK,3,Tue Jul 21 16:42:07 2015 UTC,"well it depends on exactly what you're playing.  The best advice is ""know the timing structure of a turn REALLY REALLY well.""  If they aren't fetching clot but have it out, you can just clear virus's if you have a spare turn, or you can wait to do the following if they have ways to get it back.  If you're playing cyberdex virus suite, there's a strong answer right there.  They can fetch it and you can just advance like normal, then use the virus suite and score in the same window, where they can't use an ability to get it back yet.  If they dont get clot as soon as you install a naked card, you can just use shipment and then immediately use an astroscript token or rez a sansanCityGrid (or if you have both astro and sansanCityGrid but no shipment, just advance once normally then do BOTH astro and citygrid).  They dont have a window to get clot until after you do this.  If you're trying to use biotic labor without any of the tricks above, you can install the card then use biotic labor right away, not as your last action.  often once biotic labor is used they might fetch clot immediately, in which case you'll still have three clicks to purge if you want.  Otherwise, if you strongly suspect it, you can simply bait it out with a less important agenda (either a NAPD which they might not be able to steal or if they do it will set them back, or perhaps a beale).  Finally, you can play smartly.  Know what's in their heap - it's legally available knowledge, so make sure to know if there's a clot (or smc) or not that they can get.  If they have any way to search a program, announce clicks, give a short but definite pause, then say what you're doing with them, then give a fair pause between clicks.  You dont have to specifically ask for a response, but by saying ""For click number 2......."" you've giving them a chance to say ""wait a second"".   If they look like they're thinking, give them a longer pause. if they wait until you say advance, they're clearly doing it to late in response to what you're doing.    Wait until just before your turn to rez assets - you'll make them waste clicks checking them, and if they dont you might be able to sneak an agenda in on the board for a turn in an undefended or lightly defended server.  If there get clot in response to an unadvanced install, you can leave it naked and wait to advance it (maybe they'll think you bluffed or it's an asset/sansancitygrid and then you can advance normally next turn)."
Netrunner,3dwgrb,xanarax,3,Mon Jul 20 07:03:45 2015 UTC,"All great advice, just don't expect the ""biotic->clot->purge"" play to happen often. Not against a good runner.  Another thing you can do vs clot is when it happens, don't let them just have the agenda for free - you will always have at least 1 click left, so either put some ice in front of it, or overwrite the agenda with something - best is jackson(ar some asset if you already have jackson installed in a different remote), so you can pop it back, or if you at least have cyberdex in Archives, put the agenda there so it at least gets rid of the clot for ""free"".  Another thing is, getting the first clot usually slows the shaper a bit - they quite often use their SMC and some credits to get it, then they kinda hoard their clonechips for recursion, so their options for getting other breakers out are quite often limited, you shouldn't just tunnel vision on the FA plan then. Install an agenda behind a piece of ice or two. Or bluff one naked."

I love the choice to not run Sure Gamble in decks where you know it works to do it that way, but I mostly only see it work in decks that do stupid things to get out a turn one or two Magnum Opus (usually CT.) Your MU is also going to be crowded. I would drop Sahasrara and Cache for Sure Gamble (which works great with Profession Contacts; you eventually just draw into a windfall of cash which helps you Hayley out some cool programs unexpectedly) and a one of Magnum Opus to tech against Butchershop and White Tree. If you see either of those IDs hit the table you are going to be in a money war that you can't win with Professional Contacts as your only source of income. If you're playing Lady now (like you said earlier) I would think about some Test Runs or Scavenges just to get a little more tutoring and mileage out of your programs. Even in Hayley without Comet events aren't evil. They just may not be the highest priority. They still offer the kind of utility and benefits you need."

Netrunner,3dqxbe,DarthPositus,8,Sat Jul 18 16:28:11 2015 UTC,"I love how this card is a total reference to Karma Chameleon. First of all, Chameleon returns to your grip at the end of your turn, so it really does ""come and go"". And don't forget that ""loving would be easy if your colors were like my dream/Red, gold, and green/Red, gold and green"". Guess what colors Chameleon's card art has?  As to the card itself, I haven't tested it out much, but I've seen the Hayley Chameleon+LLDS Processor deck in action and it's a beast (or a reptile?).

It's the first raw ""icebreaker"" we've seen yet, outside of spoilers Edit: ... that doesn't have a type restriction on what it can break, but isn't an AI. It's difficult to use as your primary breaker outside of Haley Potentially good combos include: Autoscripter, London Library, LLDS Processor, Ice Carver, Scheherazade, Sahasrara, Cybsoft Macrodrive.

Otherwise hard to make worth.  London Library isnt bad, but you need to play non-Kate to make really worth it. LL-Femme and Install for free via Hayley, especially with recurring install credits is particularly nice.  Personal Workshop is a very important card I feel. The worst thing about the breaker is that you are tied down on clicks. Running PW means you can use that click for the breaker on a turn you don't NEED the click.  Reminder, since its not AI... you can put it on the Dinosaurus."
Netrunner,3dqxbe,hbarSquared,1 point,Sat Jul 18 22:47:23 2015 UTC,"I've been waiting for this card since it's been spoiled, and I've been doing a lot of testing. IMO, personal workshop is a necessity. The biggest drawback of Chameleon isn't the click or cost, it's having to guess at face-down ice. Personal workshop allows you to drop your Chameleon after the ice has been rezzed, removing the guesswork and lost clicks.  The fact that pw is almost as good in Hayley as it is in Nasir is just icing on the cake."

Since 'end of turn' just like 'start of turn' is a phase, you can choose the order you do the triggers in.  Just like how you can trigger Wyldside and then sell it to Aesops, you can discard to 5 and then pick up your Chameleons.  In fact, you can do it in reverse, pick up your Chameleons, then discard to 5, just in case you want to utilize, say, Clone Chip on your next turn and you want your Chameleons in the Heap."

Netrunner,3dqqf6,RogueCarpet,2,Sat Jul 18 18:49:56 2015 UTC,"Yep.  Though it isn't strictly worse than Corroder, or at least not for the first few times you have to pump it.   For example; to break a Hadrians Wall costs 7 with Corroder, whereas it the cost to break with this (without breaking anything else with it, an implausible scenario) would be 4, 5, 7 then 10, only reaching the same cost after hitting -4 strength.  And Eli would be 2, 3, 4, 5 then 7 to Corroder's 4, with the same cost after hitting -1.  Curtain Wall is 6, 8, 11 or 4, 5, 7 to Corroder's 7 or 11, equalling at -8 or -5.  Though not good for repeated runs on high-strength ice; with careful Datasucker support you can slow down the rate at which it deteriorates, and after it does you can just get a new one!  And looking again at the numbers, it seems to be a reasonable 2-3 use breaker for the really big barriers."

Netrunner,3dpuwi,Tempests_Wrath,12,Sat Jul 18 07:43:26 2015 UTC,What's tilt
Netrunner,3dpuwi,TacCom,10,Sat Jul 18 14:00:27 2015 UTC,"Getting angry and unpleasant during competitive play, which often snowballs into making worse gameplay choices and offending the other competitors around you at the event. It's an all around dangerous mindset for the health of the player, the game, and the community.  Examples include complaining outwardly at bad luck and blaming everyone but yourself as to why you lost."
Netrunner,3dpuwi,marimbist11,16,Sat Jul 18 14:24:58 2015 UTC,"No, that's not tilt.  Tilt is a term that has been associated with luck based games for a long long time now.  It is obsessively chasing a win, even when the odds tell you to cut your losses, it's not worth it.  Traditionally it's been assigned to gamblers when they have been losing.  Gamblers who go on tilt will make bad bets they wouldn't normally make, and will stay in when they should fold, for the smallest chance at a win, no matter how unlikely.  Generally a player only goes on tilt trying to 'even up', after they've been losing or have experienced what they deem 'bad luck'.  A Netrunner player might get frustrated and Start running through a server that gives them a brain damage, two tags, and give the Corp two money for single accesses when it won't win them the game and not doing it won't lose them the game, just to desperately try for a point, thinking maybe if the top three cards are agendas I could just win  The term tilt can apply to someone acting outwardly polite and happy or sour and mean.  It refers to the act of taking bad chances you shouldn't because of the obsession for needing a win or a spot of good luck, however unlikely."
Netrunner,3dpuwi,RestarttGaming,4,Sat Jul 18 19:21:04 2015 UTC,"This is the correct definition of going on tilt.   Being a jerk at the table is just being a jerk, regardless of whether or not you're chasing an unlikely victory. Tilt can be one of the most defeating feelings in all of gaming and gambling. I think what OP was saying is good sportsmanship, above all, is what the community is about.  If your opponent is on tilt, that's actually a good thing for your odds of victory! If they pout when they lose, it's because they're a sore loser, which may not be directly related to being on tilt."
Netrunner,3dpuwi,FourDownMagic,3,Sun Jul 19 16:04:51 2015 UTC,"For me it can manifest quietly as well, where I don't think as clearly and a slight feeling of panic causes me to get mental blinders where I don't see all the information. Often occurring when I believe (rightly or not) that the gamestate has turned permanently against me."
Netrunner,3dpuwi,invictus_potato,2,Sat Jul 18 16:28:02 2015 UTC,"It's not being a poor sport, it's losing confidence in yourself and your play. Tilting in a bluffing game makes you take bad risks, either because you're salty and too aggressive, or scared and meek and too conservative."

Netrunner,3dpuwi,methamatician,8,Sat Jul 18 18:14:29 2015 UTC,"definition: on tilt  To gamble recklessly and aggressively after a bad or improbable beat or series of bad or improbable beats. Usually results in losing all of your money and then some. Good gamblers avoid this at all costs, even if it means going home earlier than expected.  e.g After he got beat three straight times, Mike went on tilt and got his whole bankroll taken (source urbandictionary)"
Netrunner,3dpuwi,Murderwagon,5,Sat Jul 18 14:22:40 2015 UTC,"I find that I always have a great time playing Netrunner and never seem to feel 'tilted', even if I lose a few in a row. I can definitely tilt when I'm playing online games like Hearthstone or whatever, but for some reason when I play a game in person I'm always just relaxed and having a good time. I think attitude is a big part of it. You only tilt when you stop having fun."
Netrunner,3dpuwi,Xercies_jday,2,Sat Jul 18 10:19:44 2015 UTC,Yeah this for me.

Netrunner,3dpuwi,Bananaman89,4,Sun Jul 19 03:44:19 2015 UTC,"My favorite thing about Netrunner is how I feel like I learn something almost every game. If you can focus on that one lesson, and how you're going to make sure it doesn't happen again, you'll manage to not go on tilt."
Netrunner,3dpuwi,Horse625,5,Sat Jul 18 14:10:02 2015 UTC,"In Netrunner or any other game in a tournament setting, sometimes it's best to just realize you've lost this round, concede, shake your opponent's hand, and step outside for a few minutes.  It's important to be able to recognize the time for this."
Netrunner,3dpuwi,SevenCs,3,Sat Jul 18 15:50:20 2015 UTC,"Sometimes, yes -- but I also think that a big part of being on tilt is thinking ""there's no way I can win this game"" when in fact, you still have an out, even if it's just ""I need to lucksack an agenda off an R&D access.""  Games are occasionally decided off the top card of R&D!  As long as there's a chance to win, even a small one, aim for it and try your best."
Netrunner,3dpuwi,Horse625,1 point,Sat Jul 18 16:37:14 2015 UTC,"I think if there's like five minutes left in the round, your whole rig just got trashed, and you've scored one point, you're better off spending those five minutes in peace and relaxation, mentally preparing for the next round."

Netrunner,3dpuwi,jkopplin,1 point,Sun Jul 19 00:22:34 2015 UTC,"I think the only time I've ever gone on tilt is against slow players in tournament play. Going to time sucks for both players. There's a guy at our shop who's a newer player. He's pretty good, actually, but takes forever to play. He's very mathematical and I believe he's running through every possible scenario/outcome and crunching the numbers. He often makes the optimal play but it can take him over a minute to complete a corp turn. That's a lot of time when you only have ~50 minutes to play a game. I played in a tournament this weekend and we only had 18 minutes for our second game. He was running Butcher Shop and I was going so fast to make up for lost time I ended up getting Scorched after a careless run. I don't want to discourage him from playing but man it's a real slog in competitive, timed play."

Netrunner,3dpuzl,heffergod,3,Sat Jul 18 10:21:57 2015 UTC,"With both being max and having a wyldside available to you, it's really unlikely you'll want to draw 5 MORE cards in one turn too often with quality time.  Usually slow draws are better in this situation.   my favorite is symmetric visage -easy to install and encourages a good practice of drawing one card per turn, plus helps econ, but isn't a mandatory draw if you dont want to.  Other slow draw includes earthrise Hotel, OR you go to 2-3 wyldsides and run 2 or three adjusted chronotype.    In your deck you dont have much to sell to aesops- you want to keep almost everything you're playing.  I see it's probably being used to turn off wyldside, but how about just getting the click back with adjusted chronotype instead?  Day job is definitely a decent card in this deck, but if you found too often you didn't have the clicks due to wyldside or you didn't want to spend a turn where you couldn't advance kati jones or run, liberated accounts gives slightly more money and you can slow release than money when you need it (although it takes one more click to use fully and takes a larger initial investment.  Do you find yourself running often needing memstrips AND grimoire AND djinn?  it seems to me you might free up a spot by just going to 2 each of your favorite.  have you considered hades shard?  if your opponent mounts a good R&D defense even crypsis might not get in, but one hades shard can be installed on an eater run or just pay 7 (and if you use instantly after installing hades shard, they can't do anything in response, like jackson howard).  if money ends up being a problem, daily casts is always good money no matter what (and works well when you're going to day job in the next few turns).  I'd put in at least one mimic - though not super common anymore, some people still run a swordsman or two (it's an anti-AI card) and the only way for you to deal with it with your current deck is parasite.  mimic also makes a lot of common 3 strength sentries slightly cheaper to break - cadeuceus and architect spring to mind.  Turing is also just run normally in some decks, but has the added benefit of being AI resistant - unless you want to spend 3 clicks on that ice for one run, adding a code gate breaker would be good as well (and if they stack 2, you cant get in without a code gate).  These aren't super common ice anymore, but they really hurt AI decks like eater/faust if they aren't planned for and do make some apperances, so best to plan for them.  If you have any questions about cards, netrunnerdb has a very robust search engine.  You can find cards by type and strength, filter by keywords in the text, and just lookup by name.  You can also actually search for decks that contain certain cards (like ""give me all decks that have eater and maxx and keyhole and parasite"") and sort them by popularity/likes.  You can even limit it to just decks that use the datapacks you have."
Netrunner,3dpuzl,kasusfactus,3,Sat Jul 18 10:57:33 2015 UTC,"I'd cut:  Self-modifying Code, Aesop's, Memstrips. Add in Levy AR Lab Access, Account Siphon, Hades Shard.  I'd probably cut the Quality Times for Femme Fetale and slap in a couple of Retrieval Runs to get them out on-the-cheap, too. It's a hell of a lot more appealing to use Femme than Crypsis.  I don't think Stimhack is great where most runs are initiated by Keyhole, either. I'd try and swap it with something else."

And also to cultivate a local scene, if possible - have a learn netrunner day at the local store if the employees will let you (find the demo decks and see if you can put up a sheet announcing it in store/have them put it on their schedule at least a week and a day ahead of time), post on local gaming forums, hold some newbie drafts or core set only events with people who have just learned.  You can keep checking here for online tournaments - most places post here when they host an online event, but they're relatively new.  Netrunner doesn't have an official online app, so any tournaments that are done are done through jinteki.net or octgn, each of which are pretty darn solid but are fan run and so have slight issues or just aren't quite up to in person play.  In addition to here, you can check out stimhack and boardgamegeek, which are two other sites netrunner enthusiasts gather.  Usually the FFG website has information on the store championships/regionals/nationals/worlds, but those are the 1/year official tournaments (which are mostly already done and most places only have nationals and worlds left).

I think the chip + extras run at ~20mA when it's actively working, which is about the same as the forward current on an LED.  So, standard alkaline batteries, let's pretend that it's not actively running code most of the time, and we can pretend that during your opponent's turn you have no LEDs on, and pull an average of 40mA draw overall (that number is completely coming out of my ass), so I'm gonna say about 50 hours?"

Look for opportunities outside the classroom, I'm not sure how it works for technologists, but in my classes we mostly covered theory, so you had to go outside of them to learn how to apply it.

You have the end of the spectrum closer to Clairvoyant Monitor, then a pretty empty middleground, then Caprice and Batty high fiving each other on their Psychic Tag Team Wrestling World Champion Belt. The poorly kept secret about Psi games is that they are actually really really bad for the corp because firing them consistently relies on an outlay of funding most corps don't have. That is, unless of course they throw a complete haymaker like ETR after you've spent 10-15 creds, or Batty into Gold for a total rig wipe.  I'd be a lot more okay with Caprice if she fired ON APPROACH to a run so she can't in one super-critical card slot, completely hamper the Runner's click and econ advantage while still offering ETR to open up scoring windows and Batty's spoiled version of costing 4 creds was okay because there are manageable real counters to this.

Netrunner,3dngg3,Kopiok,4,Fri Jul 17 19:46:31 2015 UTC,"Runner's advantage via click efficiency is a solid argument that I think I could get behind. Thinking about it in those terms, one of the reasons Butchershop is so good is that you gain click efficiency via NEH's draw ability as well as NBN's ability to reliably fast-advance agendas via San San and Astroscript (saving clicks on advancement and investing in server protection to let an agenda sit) while mitigating the Runner's click advantage by stunting the available actions the Runner can take with those clicks by threatening the kill if they are used to run (SEA Source) or steal an Agenda (Midseasons). And both of these strengths are somewhat independent of the Corp's ability tax the runner out in the mid-game, which Lady and the new Anarch toys (who break ice for very low or even no credits) have mitigated. The lack of Criminal's ability to stretch their mid-game econ by running without paying a ton of money to break may be one of the reasons that they are depressed in the meta these days. Maybe the B&E suite can fill this gap? Who knows.  As a side note, I am kind of frustrated playing against Butchershop since it seems like the only real way to not basically insta-lose against Midseasons is to out-econ the Corp, which stunts less real-credit econ inclined runners (such as stealth setups) who would otherwise do well in any other non Midseasons matchup."

While I still enjoy playing Blue Sun, it's also my sole remaining refuge for an at least pretty good Corp deck - but it really is getting harder and harder and I haven't seen much love for it in the last packs either.  On the other (the Runner's) side, I have the opposite problem, I just have to decide whether I want to go with the aptly titled God tier Kate or some other interesting and fun to play with Runner that's still tier 1.  It's not intrinsically problematic if the game is a bit lopsided for a time since you have to play both Runner and Corp anyway, but the reasons for it are pretty dire and the article sums up the worst of it, I guess. It's even sadder that the Runners actually get more fun to play with with every new toy/ID arriving, but the gap seems to widen for everyone but RP (or Batty powered Next Gold stupidigans) and Butcher Shop, but that's just the casual noob speaking."
Netrunner,3dngg3,the-_-hatman,2,Fri Jul 17 23:52:05 2015 UTC,"This is an interesting article, and I like most of its points. That said, I want to talk about two places where it's weak.  The Anarch draw engine you talk about is pretty intense, but there are ways around it. First, all the draw is based on resources, which can be trashed. Right now, the only way to trash these resources is through some manipulation of tags and traces, but hit them early, and you get a pretty good jump on the runner--even if you had to use a SEA Source to do so. It's the same idea as Supermodernism, but with resources--trash key peices of a rig to tax the runner's tricks.  I'd also want to point out that Corp decks have been slowing down. Even NEH FA is only scoring ~turn 6-7, which gives some of these engines time to set up. Certainly, if you don't pressure the runner early, you're going to have a tough late game. I'd say most Corp players are trying to make safe plays, and we're seeing more strategies that make everything just a little unsafe. To me, that's an improvement. Reliable safety means the Corp always wins."
Netrunner,3dngg3,zagzagal,4,Fri Jul 17 21:44:06 2015 UTC,"I actually just want to point out that there is at least one resource denial card that requires no mainpulation of tags and traces, being Corporate Town.  Now every faction has a 2 advancement agenda, or at least a 3 advance agenda that it's not a big deal to get rid of. I think it may be time for some corp decks go more aggressive and try and stop the econ engine early. Though this is not great against prepaid kate."
Netrunner,3dngg3,AnalysisSitus,2,Sat Jul 18 01:51:39 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure the pancake engine is the real problem here. Frankly, I have far more trouble with Anarchs playing resource econ. I'm not quite sure whether Earthrise Hotel, Clot slowing Corps down or Career Fair was the tipping point, but the fact is that just playing good resources is a ridiculously strong econ package now.  So where does it end? At risk of oversimplifying history, I would say Runners had a definite econ advantage in Genesis, with Corps catching up in Spin and eventually outpacing them by H&P (or at least by early Lunar). While SanSan isn't over yet, it currently seems to me like Runners are looking dominant economically again. While some fluctuation is probably natural, I hope the designers have something better in mind to balance the game than to hope they can tweak the relative econ power level just right."
Netrunner,3dngg3,RogueCarpet,2,Sat Jul 18 00:26:40 2015 UTC,"So... what about Ambushes? From the Core set there were three low influence options for great cards to use for the situation where you can't keep the Runner out, but pretty much no deck plays ambushes. A well-timed Aggressive Secretary can certainly make a scoring window, and a Ghost Branch can lead into a Scorched even when you're too poor for Midseasons / SEA Source.  I mean they definitely have their problems, but it seems like ambushes have almost never been popular in Netrunner despite being a predominant idea in the Core Set.  I guess in some ways ambushes can lead to the same coin-flip scenarios as Psi games. If you IAA a card when it's obvious the Runner can get in, it's a game of ""is this a trap because he knows I can access it, or is it an agenda and he's bluffing?"" For some reason to me this feels more like ""real"" Netrunner than Psi, but I can't exactly put my finger on why."

Netrunner,3dngg3,Ze_ain,1 point,Sat Jul 18 03:49:12 2015 UTC,The biggest weakness of Ambushes is that they have to survive R&D and that runners often don't have to run the remote until the corp is at match point.

Netrunner,3dngg3,Recamen,1 point,Sat Jul 18 20:31:40 2015 UTC,"I kinda wish there were more traps, yes. For remotes, sure, we have plenty: Trashing programs, net damage, trashing hardware, brain damage, even tags if that floats your boat. Sure, most people think ""Oh, you can only IAA, and that's not scary"" - fair enough, but what most folks don't realize is we live in an age where IAA isn't the only option. Government Takeover/GRNDL allow us to overadvance traps. I once had an idea for Gagarin 1-advance - it's all you need to score a 4/2, and it's all you need to trash a piece of hardware. And hell, it's a lot easier to fool the Runner on 1-advance than 2. Oh, and did I mention? I need a credit for an overadvanced Junebug... but none whatsoever for an overadvanced Plan B!  The problem I find is that traps focused on remotes and not so much on R&D/HQ. For centrals, you have Snare!, Shock!, Space Camp, technically Fetal AI, Tag Got Tag But Tag, and Shi-Kyu. This isn't exactly Murderer's Row with the possible exception of Snare!. It makes it difficult to play cards like Kitsune or Shiro.  NBN's Haarpsichord Studios helps out Kitsune - I've given the Runner a TGTBT then scored a Restructured Datapool with Kitsune and this ID, and boy is it gratifying! (You can use agendas as traps. It's pretty sweet!) I look forward to seeing Award Bait and Explode-a-Palooza. Odd, isn't it?

This card is awful. Turn 1, it's completely random if it'll be good. If they drew their pop up window, wraparound, quandary, etc, then you have 3 dead draws in your deck and it becomes the horrible exchange of a click for 2 or less credits. If they only drew lotus field, and the corp rezzed turn 1, then it'll do work. But after turn one, it gets a lot worse. Every card the corp draws puts them closer to Mental health Clinic or pup or whatever is the cheapest card in their deck. And that's the important part, btw...EVERY deck runs something tiny. If RP has Bako and Pups, and MHC, then imagine how dead this is against NBN! Even Weyland runs Meru Mati. I only tested this against RP, but it was always dead draw, and it made siphoning a lot harder, since you are providing the corp with damn good tag-punishment."
Netrunner,3dmlj3,pbrand,6,Fri Jul 17 15:32:54 2015 UTC,"As someone else on the subreddit mentioned last week, Cyber Threat is actually a pretty good combo with this (possibly redeemable?): you sacrifice the Gang Member by trashing him during a run in which the corp declines the offer to rez the ice. Since you're already running on the server and Cyber Threat says ""cannot rez ice"" in general, that limits the scope of rezzable cards due to Gang Member to currently-installed nonrezzed assets/upgrades.  It still seems like quite the edge case, though. I don't know if I'd want to give away a free SanSan Grid or Root."

Figuring out the situations where it WON'T work, (and ways to mitigate them) is probably as important as figuring out places where it will.  You're exactly right - if they have a lot of choices about what to derez, they can soften the blow a lot.  Heck, even if they don't have many choices, if they have a rezzed popup window or something, then it's worthles.  Where this card has a lot of potential (imho) is in a deck where you, the runner, can limit or control their rezzed cards.  Cards with cheap rez costs either tend to be assets (which are trashable in advance) or cheap ice.  Cheap ice tends to be fairly vulnerable to parasite and other forms of ice destruction.  So I think Muertos are going to shine in a heavy denial-style deck, similar to Headlock Reina - Destroy anything rezzed that's cheap, and derez anything expensive that they manage to get rezzed.  I DON'T think it's a card you'd want to just drop into a deck without any support.  But there's nothing wrong with that.  It's still a free derez, with no conditions on it, other than that the corp gets to trigger it.  It may not be as versatile as Emergency Shutdown, but it has enough good aspects to make an excellent supplement to it."

Perhaps the necessary support for this card hasn't come yet or maybe it just doesn't work well in the current meta.  I have found some use for this card against Blue Sun to stop the OAI + Curtain Wall combo or to prevent big bounce backs like Toolbooth or Hadrian's Wall. Blue Sun likes to have a single thing rezzed at a time early game so that they can bounce it back making Muertos a decent way to counter it without wasting a David or spending an inordinate amount of credits.  Will look more into it against other match-ups. I don't it's as bad and unplayable as Cyber Threat, for instance :)  EDIT: I'm testing it in Geist Trash Mob and Iain Connection decks, so that might be biasing my view a tad."
Netrunner,3dmlj3,DarthPositus,3,Fri Jul 17 23:23:38 2015 UTC,"I love this card in my Andy connections deck. First of all, a 0 cost connection is fantastic for Off-Campus Apartment and Calling in Favors. But secondly, when played right this can become an even better Inside Job. A few days ago at a tournament, I was playing against an NBN deck and made sure that nothing was rezzed (didn't run on centrals and trashed all assets, which were unprotected due to their cost). When the Corp started to score out an agenda, I ran their server, got stopped by a Tollbooth, then installed Muertos, forcing the derez of Tollbooth. So when I ran again, the Corp had to go broke to rez it again to keep me out. I quickly drew the other two Muertos and basically ended up costing the Corp 24 credits for installing 3 0 cost cards, all of which gave me free card draw with Off-Campus and provided extra credits with Calling in Favors.  Now, that good of a use is definitely an edge case, but I think that Muertos is an awesome card; all it takes is the right play at the right time."
Netrunner,3dmlj3,BoomFrog,2,Sat Jul 18 05:10:37 2015 UTC,"This works best in a ""few big runs "" deck that often leaves the corp with few rezzed cards. It's an opportunistic card so I usually play only 1 of it so there is no chance it will clog my hand."
Netrunner,3dmlj3,Kopiok,2,Fri Jul 17 16:49:09 2015 UTC,"I like this card, but I like it only with Off Campus Apartment and Geist. This acts like a draw 3 cards with both of those, but it lets you save two of those draws for later, can allow for opportunistic derezzes (but will often just do nothing), works with Calling In Favors, and is instant draw that can save you from a kill.  There are a surprising number of windows during a game to pop the trash effect where you don't have a particular concern about the Corp getting that free rez."
Netrunner,3dmlj3,mdc273,2,Fri Jul 17 15:03:35 2015 UTC,"I feel like everyone is missing where this card becomes particularly obnoxious. The weakness to weak Ice is true, but if you derez and then immediately force a rez on a 1c card, that's 1c less the corp has AND a drawn card.  The card shines when your opponent's whole board is rezzed. This card will be amazing in that scenario. It effectively becomes click to draw a card and force the corp to spend the rez cost of their cheapest card. If you start to focus on controlling out the low rez cost cards, it becomes even better. It may wind up being utterly terrible, but there is a scenario where this card is amazing and very playable."
Netrunner,3dmlj3,kronosdev,3,Fri Jul 17 18:04:54 2015 UTC,"Actually Muertos Gang Member sucks in that scenario. You spend a click to play a card that lets the corp derez anything they want, and then they get it back for free if you ever run that server or decide you want that card. You might as well click for a card, and if you aren't running Muertos Gang Member your chances of hitting that useful draw is better. Nevertheless the card is useful. Think Leela Crecentus Headlock or Off Campus Apartment shenanigans in Geist. Those archetypes offset the downsides and either turn them into early game advantage (where Muertos Gang Member actually shines) or as pieces of an engine that gives you back more value than you put in. 3 cards in Geist with Off Campus Apartment. That makes it worth it."
Netrunner,3dmlj3,The_queens_cat,5,Fri Jul 17 18:49:55 2015 UTC,"This card is good. I've had to re-rez the same Spiderweb 4 times in one game against Geist. Eventually I got corporate town to blow up the off-campus apartment that all his shenanigans were hosted on, and got a free San San out of it, so that was nice I guess."

A lot of people get hooked on its downsides which quite frankly don't exist. If you are playing against NBN and they trash it their estimated value out of it will be a maximum of 4 credits, because NBN doesn't even play Tollbooth.  Did I mention how this is almost as good as d4v1d against Blue Sun?  I would not play this card competitively without Parasite, but in a Parasite deck it goes automatically in because it's very strong. You have to contest assets though."

Netrunner,3dmlj3,AnalysisSitus,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:23:54 2015 UTC,"I'm kind of on the fence about this. If the Corp has cheap ice or assets lying around when you install it, it's not really doing much. Also, even if you nail something expensive with this, you need to either make sure it sticks around, remove all unrezzed expensive stuff or live with the fact that the Corp is going to get a nice windfall at some point.  Now, the reason I am on the fence about this is that there seems to be a lot of support for ""messy rezzing"" around, so it's conceivable that you can meet all of these conditions. I think that one of two things is going to happen - either someone makes a strong deck which causes havoc with forced derezzing/rezzing, or FFG is going to keep supporting it until they do."

Then he hangs around for the rest of the game, threatening to stab you in the back as soon as you get tagged, giving the corp a free Curtain Wall.  ""Santiagold?  I don't know him...""

Netrunner,3dmlj3,steveklabnik1,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:25:49 2015 UTC,"So I was playing Leela yesterday vs NEH, and I'm trying out Muertos Gang Member. It has nice synergy with her ability, because derezzed cards are bounce-able, but rezzed cards aren't. It's also nice to get one run in, so with a field of unrezzed ICE, you make a run, they flip the ice, you play MGM, and now they're back to 100% derezzed.  In addition, they stack up. And the rezzing ability isn't even that bad. Case in point: my opponent and I were both at game point. I had three gang members in play. They IAA something in a two-ice deep remote. I had two out of my three breakers. I trashed all three members, and they rezzed both their ICE. The draws drew me into a Special Order, and I was able to see exactly what ICE were there, so I fetched my third breaker (which I needed, as it turns out) and managed to get in. Without the draw + knowledge, it wouldn't have happened.  It's possible I just hit a number of upsides with little downsides in these first few games, but it felt good."
Netrunner,3dmlj3,vicvonshroom,1 point,Sat Jul 18 13:32:41 2015 UTC,This shuts off sundew before it would fire if it's the only card rezzed and is nice if you want to tax the Corp a bit more. The downside is the giving them a somewhat free rezoning. Its decent protection along with a singleton plascrete in geist.
Netrunner,3dmlj3,SevenCs,2,Sun Jul 19 14:59:03 2015 UTC,"Are we sure it shuts off Sundew? It seems to me that as soon as you spend the click to install the Muertos, Sundew should pay out."
Netrunner,3dmlj3,GardensOfBoydstylon,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:26:56 2015 UTC,"I may be wrong, but I think that since their triggers are simultaneous, the runner's abilities trigger first, so the derez due to Muertos happens before Sundew can fire."
Netrunner,3dmlj3,rumirumirumirumi,4,Fri Jul 17 18:46:47 2015 UTC,"Spending a click to install happens before the install, so Sundew money comes down the pipe before you actually install MGM, which is the trigger for the derez."
Netrunner,3dmlj3,vicvonshroom,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:07:41 2015 UTC,"If it's the only card resized, yeah it shuts it off as it has to be derezzed and no money comes from it. I believe the triggers follow priority order so it depends on whose turn it is, sundew only works on the runners turn so they get to decide which fires fire."
Netrunner,3dmlj3,DrMastodon,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:39:03 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure if that would shut Sundew off.  In the FAQ, it says ""The credits are gained when the Runner spends a click to initiate an action that does not make a run on the server Sundew is installed in, before the click is resolved. If the Runner plays a run event to initiate a run on the server Sundew is installed in, the Corp does not gain 2 credits.""  So the way I read that is you spend the click to install, Sundew triggers on the click being spent, Corp gets their two credits, then the install effect is resolved, and Sundew is de-rezzed."
Netrunner,3dmlj3,vicvonshroom,-1,Fri Jul 17 19:42:42 2015 UTC,"Since it's the runner's turn though, they trigger simultaneously. and it goes to priority order which means The Runner so the sundew would have to derez before it's ability can trigger since it would fire afterward."
Netrunner,3dmlj3,DrMastodon,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:54:26 2015 UTC,"I'm still not convinced it shuts it down.

If anyone knows the artist for some of these (excepting the obvious console ones) let me know and I'll edit the cards to give them credit!  The only ones I think I'm missing as singletons are Aesop's and Troubleshooter (which I wasn't too worried about due to promos of both existing) and Zaibatsu (mostly because I couldn't find a good picture). If anyone has art suggestions for any of these let me know! I'm also looking for good suggestions for Stronger Together, Replicating Perfection, and TWIY* so we have more interesting art for them.

On top of this, you can dig into deck building by customizing all of these decks.   You can get quite a bit of mileage out of this alone, but most people get terribly addicted and the purchases just keep on coming. :)"

Yeah, he ""protected"" it from being trashed, but at the same time, doing that prevented him from using it for most of the game without the corp having to spend 2 credits and a click. As the corp, I might be willing to make that trade: a temporary trash of an important resource for free? Maybe!  I wish it was more clear at the time that it happened, because I remember watching it and being as confused as the commentators. I didn't remember the corp trashing it, but surely the runner wouldn't have trashed it on his own without the corp doing so...it was a weird situation, and it's hard knowing you were there and could have done something about it if you only knew what happened."
Netrunner,3djfjo,Bananaman89,2,Thu Jul 16 20:19:45 2015 UTC,"I agree, but I feel like the best compromise would have been to bring it out during the Weyland player's turn, as it was trashed at the end of the runner's turn.

Netrunner,3djfjo,vicvonshroom,3,Thu Jul 16 20:36:53 2015 UTC,"You had the parasite in heap and having it out earlier(The PW I mean) would have provided a target to trash. Nasir is widely known for needing to have PW out and even if it was empty, it's a threat and most likely would have been destroyed. Especially considering there was another one trashed. If it was out, I really think the Weyland player would have trashed it before.   I realize you asked the opponent if you could bring it back as it's stated in the video but again, that action did help win you the game as it allowed for the clone chip. I'm not saying you wouldn't have won otherwise as you did have the money but it being out did save you credits. Rewatching the video, I was way too harsh and I'm sorry.   That being said, you won with Nasir and that's always a good thing as I do love him. I think the corp player made a fatal flaw not advancing the Orion one more time. If he had, you would have had zero credits and it would have been a different story."

Again, not trying to be harsh but just giving some constructive criticism on the matter. I love the content you provide, I just don't like waiting so long for it if another option is available. Thanks for reading."
Netrunner,3djfjo,BeardedThomas,6,Thu Jul 16 22:07:20 2015 UTC,"In this case, I apologize for taking so long for these releases. For this series, it was partially a matter of me taking too long after the event to cut the VODs (I was feeling burnt out, the event was pretty draining) and being pretty busy at work lately. I usually release the VODs in the middle of my work day, which probably isn't great, but sometimes the day goes by so fast that I completely forget to do the release and by the time I realize it, my release window is closed (I try to release between 3pm and 3:30pm Eastern, which seems to be the sweet spot for me). That timing gets all thrown off on weekends, too, especially July 4th, so I don't like releasing videos on weekends if it feels awkward or inconvenient. Also, this helps to avoid flooding the sub with too many videos, which people have expressed concern with in the past. So, yeah, it's a bunch of excuses, and I'm sorry they didn't come out as fast as you wanted.  Doing a stream like this is a lot of work, and as a result, I want each video to get as much attention as it deserves. It's a verifiable fact that if I dump all the videos at once, they don't get anywhere close to the amount of viewership that releasing videos one by one does. So yeah, my main motivation for making these videos is for fun, but my motivation for continuing to make videos is if people appreciate the videos. If more people are watching them, then more people are enjoying them, which keeps me motivated to keep going. If I dump a pile of videos all at once, it can be pretty demotivating if they don't get as much viewership as my other videos. The reason I know this is because I actually did this once. I released all the FCB SMC videos all at once in one single big post . The viewership on those videos compared to my others has been pretty terrible, except for one particular MaxX vs. RP game. It felt pretty bad to put all that energy into the stream and not feel very rewarded for it.  For what it's worth, the whole event has been on my Twitch channel uncut since the event concluded, so that was always an option as well. Obviously I prefer people watching on YouTube more because I get better feedback, but that is there anyway."

Per Breaking Subroutines rules (pg. 18), ""an icebreaker can interact with a piece of ice (but) the icebreaker's strength must be equal to or higher than the encountered ice's strength."" All of this mixed with the ""icebreakers cannot break subroutines outside of an encounter,"" means so long as Spike meets or beats the ICE's strength prior to you trashing it, the ability will still go through, regardless of the fact it no longer exists. This also solves peoples issues with the way Street Peddler works."

Netrunner,3di3mq,neutronicus,6,Thu Jul 16 16:35:25 2015 UTC,"This is essentially the same question as when people question how Street Peddler works. The rules say that when you trash something, the trash happens first then the effect (that is how Scavenge works, since its a ""cost"" just like the ""cost"" of trashing Spike or Street Peddler).  Now both Spike and Street Peddler trash themselves to do something that can only be done in the context of them being installed, meaning that if the cost is paid first, the effect can no longer resolve (Spike can no longer break Wraparound both because it should now be Strength 7, and Street Peddler because all of the things hosted on it are trashed when it is and are no longer hosted).  Basically the rules break down around these interactions - the only way to really handle this is to state that that you decide the outcome of the ability and then pay the cost so that the outcome becomes frozen before the cost is paid, but in that case Scavenge stops working without some specific errata."
Netrunner,3di3mq,vampire0,2,Thu Jul 16 14:13:49 2015 UTC,"Scavenge isn't an accurate comparison.  Scavenge is a play cost - it can't resolve unless a Program is trashed, just like how you can't resolve Sure Gamble unless you spend 5 credits.  Spike is a paid ability - they resolve instantly based on current gamestate.  Edit for clarity: I appreciate that you can't resolve a paid ability unless you can pay for it either, but point is playing/installing/rezzing and paid abilities are distinct keywords, so rules don't conflict over them."
Netrunner,3di3mq,BrogueLeader,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:33:26 2015 UTC,"Is there a rule that states they are different?

Netrunner,3di3mq,JohnQK,-3,Fri Jul 17 04:56:48 2015 UTC,"It doesn't - that rule clearly states that the card is now inactive, which means for an ice breaker it no longer has strength, and if it did, Wraparound is back to 7. For a Street Peddler, the fact that the card is inactive means all of the hosted cards would have been trashed, this passage only handles effects like Fall Guy where the resolution of the effect does not require referencing the card that is being trashed.  In order for the ability to do what you suggest it would need a clause that states that the ability resolves ""as if the card was still active"", or the more extreme version that Luks has ruled that it resolves ""in the game state"" of when the ability was paid.  Without those clauses, Street Peddler, at least, would not work, and Spike... Probably would (as it would not be illegal to resolve breaking a subroutine)... I'd have to look at how they word the ice/breaker interactions to determine if using the paid ability counts as interaction or the resolution of the effect."

Netrunner,3di3mq,JohnQK,-2,Fri Jul 17 11:54:19 2015 UTC,"But can Spike break routines on a 7 Strength ice? No - so resolving the effect is no longer legal unless Spike is considered to be still active in some way. That is, depending on what portion of the paid ability is considered ""interacting"" with the ice, the cost or the ability. I lean towards the ability, since if paying the costs of a paid ability on an ice breaker counted as interaction, then you couldn't pump-to-break.  For Street Peddler is even worse - the moment she becomes inactive, all the hosted cards on her are trashed, so you can try to resolve her ""text"" all day long, but there is nothing hosted on her to install. Without the Lukas rules-addendum, Street Peddler cannot work.  Lukas's rule addendum makes it clear how these abilities work, but absolutely has to be in an FAQ a, and preferably just an updated rulebook."
Netrunner,3di3mq,vampire0,1 point,Fri Jul 17 12:03:10 2015 UTC,"The Ice was 0 when Spike got over the interaction hurdle.

Netrunner,3di3mq,JohnQK,0,Fri Jul 17 12:39:40 2015 UTC,"Ok, so you claim it ""got over the interaction hurdle"" - when exactly does that happen? At the time the paid ability is used? When the subs are broken?  And, yes card text always trumps - but there is no text on Street Peddler stating that cards hosted on it are still considered hosted after its trashed - that is the ""errata"" that some were asking for on the card. You're right, the rules as intended clearly say what should happen... but the RAW provides rules for trashing with hosted cards and there is no countering text on Street Peddler.  Only Lukas's ruling actually alters that."
Netrunner,3di3mq,vampire0,0,Fri Jul 17 20:18:24 2015 UTC,It could interact when it's strength was equal to or greater than the Ice.   Install 1 card . . .
Netrunner,3di3mq,JohnQK,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:42:36 2015 UTC,"But does the interaction happen when you pay for the ability or when it resolves? The strength of Wraparound changes between those two states in this example. If ""interacting"" is defined as ""using a paid ability on an ice breaker"" then the whole game breaks down (as you can't pump breakers to then break routines). If you count ""interacting"" as breaking routines (or reducing Strength as on Wyrm) then at the time the ""interaction"" occurs Wraparound is strength 7 and Spike, even if it was installed is still only 1 Strength (or 0 since its own text is now blank).  Again, this is all pointless as Lukas has altered the resolution of trash-abilities to allow for both to work (its resolve in which the game state of Wraparound was Strength 0), but as RAW I don't think there is a rule that states what counts as ""interaction"" and when that is triggered within the order of paying for and resolving a paid ability."
Netrunner,3di3mq,vampire0,0,Fri Jul 17 21:07:01 2015 UTC,"I think your confusing the game term ""interacting"" with the actual meaning of the word ""interacting.""

The strength only remains for the duration of the encounter."
Netrunner,3di3mq,JohnQK,6,Fri Jul 17 21:13:37 2015 UTC,"From memory, I believe the wording in the rule book is that a breaker has to have strength equal to or greater than the ice in order to interact with it.  So that would mean that strength is checked before you can activate the ability to break.  To me, that means a trashable fracter should be able to break Wraparound."
Netrunner,3di3mq,Horse625,7,Thu Jul 16 16:55:45 2015 UTC,"Huh, interesting question. A day ago I'd say yes, since you paid the cost when it was possible to resolve the ability, but with the new FAQs out, it seems paying the cost might not automatically give you the effect if the effect is no longer resolvable.  Here's another question: does the icebreaker being trashed have any strength? Because the text on cards is only active when installed (or played), so at the moment of trashing, Spike could have a strength of 0. This is kind of the inverse of your question: either Spike gets 0 STR, or the ICE gets +7 STR. Based on that test, I'd say the answer would almost have to be yes, or else the whole suite is useless."
Netrunner,3di3mq,the-_-hatman,3,Thu Jul 16 13:47:26 2015 UTC,The ice breakers keep their strength but no longer have them after resolving the break ability. The break happens as a result of the trash but that can't be used if it doesn't match strength.
Netrunner,3di3mq,vicvonshroom,1 point,Thu Jul 16 13:56:25 2015 UTC,"Sure, but both Spike's gained strength and the ""installed fracter"" clause are dependent on Spike being installed. For that matter, the actual breaking text is only active if Spike is installed. If you trash first and then get the ability, the new FAQ makes the ability unusable.  Here's my guess for how ""trash:"" abilities resolve: The player declares they are using the ability. This card is then set aside, still installed, therefore still active, so the ability can be resolved. The ability is resolved. Then the card is trashed.  This is a lot like how I understand Overmind works: You declare the install, set the program on the table, paying all install costs. It is not yet installed. Then you trash installed programs at your discretion. After that, you move the program to ""installed,"" and resolve any ""On install"" abilities. (I might have those two middle steps mixed up.) Either way, there's a temporary space where the cards keep their status while resolving the action. I'm tempted to call it something cutesy, like ""swap space,"" but w/e."

Netrunner,3di3mq,Krystman,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:26:25 2015 UTC,"Really good question. You first have to pay the cost (trashing one card), then your MU immediately drops to 0 which is a nested effect, that causes you to need to trash programs, specifically Faust, and now that your game state has moved on to one where the remaining effects (breaking the Quandary) are invalid, then the effect would be terminated as ""fizzle"".  The question is, is the end state of ""break a subroutine"" still valid? The ice breaker is no longer in play, but the ice still exists to be broken (and you are still encountering it, since nothing about this scenario changes your encounter state). I mean, you can't reasonably argue that you can break Ice with a Breaker that is in your heap, which is where the Faust would be at the time that the subroutine completion fires.  I'm honestly not sure of the answer - I think the rules-as-intended are clear, otherwise something like Deus X just doesn't work (a self contained example) - but the RAW makes it unclear.  I'e thought through several ways that there could be a blanker ruling about how to resolve this kind of thing, but I don't know how to word it - basically you'd have to choose all of the outcomes of the ability before paying the cost in order to make the system work properly, and then issue an errata for Scavenge to make it behave as intended."

Netrunner,3di3mq,plopplopplopz,2,Thu Jul 16 17:31:06 2015 UTC,Spike is a Fracter. With it installed Wraparound is strength zero. As a 1 strength Fracter (since it counts itself when determining its strength) it has no problem breaking a zero strength barrier.  Edit: Misunderstood the question. I still think the answer is correct though. I think you only check strength at the point of paying costs to interact.
Netrunner,3di3mq,Rejusu,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:14:08 2015 UTC,"It would make sense for the game to remember the state a card was in when it was trashed. After you trash it, when the ability resolves, the game would use the last known strength of the fracter, which is at least 1."

Netrunner,3di3mq,vicvonshroom,-2,Thu Jul 16 13:53:40 2015 UTC,"That is not actually true though - the rules are clear that costs are paid before effects resolve - this is why when you play Sure Gamble with 5 credits and Order of Sol in play you end up gaining not just the 9 credits but the 1 from Order of Sol - the cost (5c) is paid, Order of Sol resolves, and hen the 9c effect is gained.  You pay the cost (trashing Spike) and the strength of Wraparound immediately goes back to 7 before the effect (breaking) is determined."
Netrunner,3di3mq,vampire0,0,Thu Jul 16 14:20:39 2015 UTC,"Lukas has agreed with me that it breaks it but this is wrong for one thing, effects always resolve in the turn of the active player first so first the break happens then the ice goes back to 7 but is broken.

Netrunner,3dijy2,hanshasuro,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:39:02 2015 UTC,I would totally join that.
Netrunner,3dii0w,nelsormensch,16,Thu Jul 16 15:25:02 2015 UTC,I like that it's mandatory. Holding Snare! in hand while scoring never felt so good.
Netrunner,3dii0w,BlueSapphyre,5,Thu Jul 16 15:39:50 2015 UTC,The hubris of gangs often makes revenge mandatory.
Netrunner,3dii0w,pbrand,5,Thu Jul 16 22:35:01 2015 UTC,"Indeed. I just played against a person who was running 3x Gang Sign and 3x HQI, with a deck that apparently was designed to never run anything. It was a pretty boring match until I got three Snares in hand and laughed all the way to the flatline."
Netrunner,3dii0w,ajpl,12,Fri Jul 17 04:39:06 2015 UTC,"Seemingly simple card with some occasional complexity.  As these are not unique, you can install multiple Gang Signs. They also benefit from HQI and Nerve Agent counters (it doesn't add Nerve Agent counters, but can utilize any already there). However, they trigger one at a time, so with 2 Gang Signs and 1 HQI installed:   Corp scores an agenda. Gang Sign #1 - Access 2 random cards from HQ. Score/trash as appropriate and anything remaining goes back into HQ.  Gang Sign #2 - Access 2 random cards from HQ again, potentially accessing the same two cards you just accessed.   Now if you're playing Leela, things get more interesting. When the Corp scores their agenda, you can choose to use her ID ability and bounce a card back to HQ first or choose to use the Gang Sign first, and things apply as above.  However, if during a Gang Sign access, you steal an agenda, you must resolve Leela's ID ability from that steal before doing anything else. So with 1 HQI and 2 Gang Signs playing as Leela, it's:   Corp scores agenda. Leela opts to use Gang Sign #1 first and accesses two cards in HQ. Leela accesses an Operation and an Agenda. Steals agenda, and now must bounce some unrezzed card back to HQ. Leela uses Gang Sign #2, seeing an Operation and an ICE. Leela resolves her ID ability from the original Corp agenda score, putting another unrezzed card back into HQ.   And of course Leela is welcome to mix up the order of Gang Sign #1, Gang Sign #2 and her ID ability (from the original Corp score) as she sees fit."
Netrunner,3dii0w,sigma83,5,Thu Jul 16 15:34:07 2015 UTC,"To add on to this, the synergy with Logos is pretty brutal.  If you have a couple of gang signs or HQIs installed (not difficult to do in a slow deck that runs Logos) every time they score the following things happen:  You get to access 1-4 cards in HQ (essentially a clickless, runfree legwork) although there might be some access overlap.  Logos will then trigger (since you choose the order of your triggers) allowing you to get the R&D attack card of your choice. Alternatively, denial cards like Vamp or Siphon.  Or, if you didn't get to see a lot in HQ, you can simply go fetch an HQ card.  Hit the corp! Now the agendas aren't really in HQ, they aren't in R&D, and you have a few more turns as a slow deck to set up and really turn the screws.  While the mental image of Iain Stirling doing Gang Signs is pretty funny, it does perfectly jive with my image of Stirling as a badass Private Investigator type. Of course he would have dirty connections with gangs - no one can make it as a runner that long without some underworld contacts."
Netrunner,3dii0w,FricasseeToo,4,Thu Jul 16 17:24:34 2015 UTC,"I had assumed Sterling was ex-CIA (or equivalent), which means it would be highly likely that he could have a number of criminal ""assets."""

Most corps will know to play around this, and to not score when they have an agenda in hand, but that's okay. You get to see what's in their hand, which is nice.  The obvious pairing for this card is HQ Interface or Nerve Agent. A secondary incredible pairing is Imp or Scrubber. Being able to trash the cards that you see (since they won't be agendas if the corp is smart about it) is very nice.   I really wish that this card was less influence.

Netrunner,3dii0w,invictus_potato,3,Thu Jul 16 20:37:19 2015 UTC,"It's expensive to port, but can work well in Ed Kim and Whizzard decks. It allows you to trash something on their turn and lets you threaten more than just agendas."
Netrunner,3dii0w,Joshfullmer,2,Fri Jul 17 03:05:30 2015 UTC,"This card is great for big rig/big connection decks. Only great early, though, if you get is mid-game it could still be worth the install but it may not do anything for you depending on what the opponent is running."

Netrunner,3dii0w,TonyStellato,2,Fri Jul 17 13:40:59 2015 UTC,"The reason I don't think we'll see this in any tier one decks is that I don't see it being much good at all vs. NEH (and it would only be OK against a good RP player)  NEH: Your gang sign may snag you an agenda you didn't want and bring on the midseasons. Also jackson & DBS can keep a low number of agendas in hand.  RP: your spending your time/money throwing down gang sign & HQI may allow them to score a nisei MK II more easily. Even if you see an agenda, it is probably future perfect or NAPD, just the agendas they'd rather have you going for."

Netrunner,3dja0j,haXeNinja,11,Thu Jul 16 18:48:19 2015 UTC,I have run a stimack bagbiter deck. The answer is actually very intuitive. By default the runners handsze is 5. Bagbiter changes this number.  After that all the reductions/increases apply as usual.   Bagbiter at 0 creds?  Hand size 0. bagbiter at 0 with public sympathy?  Hands ize 2 bagbiter at 1 cred with three brain damage?  Hand size -2. Best click for credits before your turn ends or else you'll flat line.
Netrunner,3dja0j,BountyHunterSAx,6,Thu Jul 16 19:00:44 2015 UTC,"Rule 2 (brain damage) does not supersede rule 1(normal), it modifies it. Big difference.  Rule 3 (bagbiter) does supersede rule 1, and is then modified by rule 2 just like rule 2 previously modified rule 1."

Fantasy Flight licensed Netrunner from WotC to make A:NR but WotC has no involvement with the game beyond that.
Netrunner,3dja0j,Rejusu,2,Thu Jul 16 20:51:44 2015 UTC,Some even more additional information. It is android netrunner instead of netrunner as ONR used a licensed setting (cyberpunk 2020) instead of the android setting. Alas I will never get a Loan from Chiba again....

Netrunner,3dja0j,arribous,3,Thu Jul 16 21:19:12 2015 UTC,"To answer your questions:  1) Theo + 5 creds + 2 brain dmg = Max Handsize of 3.   2) Theo + 0 creds + 2 brain dmg = Max Handsize of -2. In your scenario, it's the end of the runner's turn, they have a max hand size of less than 0, so the runner is now flatlined. Remember that there's a special rule for max hand size; if the runner ends their turn with a max hand size of less than 0, they are flatlined.  3) Theo + Closed Accounts + 2 brain dmg = Max Handsize of -2, but the runner is not yet dead because it is not yet the end of the runner's turn. If the runner ends their next turn with at least 2 credits, they have a max hand size of 0, and are not flatlined.  Hand size boosters like public sympathy and brain cage work the same way, adding cards to the total that you get from Theo. Theo just changes your default max hand size from 5 to ""X"", where X is your credits."

PsychoBeale is as well just because it's not as focused as a pure Astrobiotics deck, but can still win because NBN is so strong.   Most of the janky stuff I'd consider to be Tier 3 because they're not yet as consistently powerful as the top decks. A lot of things like PE, IG and Nisei flatline kind of rely on the element of surprise and their opponents making mistakes/getting unlucky hitting Snares in centrals (as an example) to win so they'll carve up one tourney and then not really work again.  (ninja edit): The top decks are so consistent because they have an extremely strong plan that can be pulled off very very consistently. Butcher Shop relies on the opponent making a mistake to some extent, but it can also create no-win situations with Breaking News and Midseasons more consistently than other kill decks."

Their consistent net damage picks off the IHW eventually. A mid to late game Snare! will often knock out 2 at a time. A mid to late game Psychic Field can take them all out. It's a factor, for sure. But not a deal breaker.  Keyhole plus Parasite decks... they are the bane of Personal Evolution."

As stated, tier 2 decks can take games from tier 1 decks, and may be ""tier 2"" just due to being very player-specific. Tier 3 decks aren't strictly ""bad"", but may lack support cards or tuning needed to bring them up.  I often feel constrained by tiers, as my favorite runner is Kit. I don't want to give up on her, and even when I do, inevitably I come back to her. Her power grows with each cycle, and because she's in a deluxe box, she'll never rotate out. She's powerful, and in my mind proves what I've seen some of the top players doing: don't give up on what you love (decks or otherwise in life) and eventually you can find a way to make it work."
Netrunner,3dgjd6,X-factor103,2,Thu Jul 16 15:12:55 2015 UTC,"Her power grows with each cycle   Sadly, I think Marcus Batty was sort of a gut-punch to Kit in particular.  She's definitely the only runner I would have considered running Personal Tough + Yog.0 in, but now, I don't think even Yog.0 is viable."
Netrunner,3dgjd6,Lomar4976,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:16:10 2015 UTC,"Gut punch for what? Program trashing? (admittedly I haven't played against Batty yet)  Program trash has always been tough for Kit. But you're still a Shaper. You have recursion, tutoring, and good card draw/click effiency. If it's damage you fear, feedback filter protects you from 2 of 3 types of damage.  There are tough match-ups, but no obstacle is insurmountable. I'll probably keep playing Kit."
Netrunner,3dgjd6,Kopiok,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:21:22 2015 UTC,"Yeah, man, that Batty'd Program Trash is rough.  Stealth Kit is still fine (except in so far as it's just not that great), but Yog-y Kit is not."
Netrunner,3dgjd6,Isva,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:33:55 2015 UTC,"Yep, I see now. I'd never run Yog personally because I find it too janky. I'm currently using something more consistent, in the form of stealth (refractor), or if I swap those cards out I tend to revert to Zu/CyCy or Gordian (depending on the tempo I want to play at)."
Netrunner,3dgjd6,BinarySecond,2,Thu Jul 16 15:49:30 2015 UTC,"Not sure if its feasible, but it'd be nice to see whats stopping Tier 2 decks becoming tier 1... I'm presuming for instance that the Blue Sun decks are still only Tier 2 due to D4V1D stopping the OAI/Big ice combo piece, but is there more to it?  Personally, I much prefer playing Tier 2 decks than Tier 1 decks that you see everywhere, but I don't have the play experience to know what to look out for as far as 'things that tech my deck specifically' rather than things that are just 'goodstuff' that all decks need to play around."
Netrunner,3dgjd6,BoomFrog,2,Thu Jul 16 07:59:41 2015 UTC,"Good point! Blue Sun (with OAI) has fairly bad Shaper and Anarch matchups (due to Lady/infinite money and D4v1d/I've Had Worse respectively) and they're the most popular runner factions. RP and NEH still have the dynamic where if you tech heavily against one, it causes you problems against the other. Blue Sun can be teched against while maintaining good matchups against other decks.  I'll add it to the original article to make it a bit clearer, thanks for pointing it out!"
Netrunner,3dgjd6,RUBY_FELL,1 point,Thu Jul 16 08:33:50 2015 UTC,Lady is the worst thing that ever happened to Blue Sun. I think the new Spiderweb ice will make a big splash as far as Blue Sun's ability to compete with Kate goes.
Netrunner,3dgjd6,BinarySecond,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:15:27 2015 UTC,"I think Spiderweb is going to make the Shaper matchup a whole lot better. It's cheap and causes real trouble for Lady (double Spiderweb all but locks Kate out of a server), and because you're Blue Sun you can save it from the predations of Parasite if they try and take it out- especially since Kate often forgoes Datasucker."

Elizabeth mills removes more bad pub  It can protect ice from being trashed by parasite until you clear virus (parasite stays and builds counters, but the ice isn't trashed until it's rezzed )  It can protect ice from cutlery mid run.  It can let you reset chimera when the runner thinks they can install the right program then get through.  You can de-rez all ice except mother goddess to make it untyped.  It can protect things from unregistered 35 if done before the runners turn.  It can let you rez a unique card in another server without trashing it the original, like having a caprice on R&D and a remote.  Basically anything with an effect on rez or anything that depends on ice being rezzed, like cutlery.  You can use breaker bay grid to rez something expensive, then derez your breaker bay to allow you to use blue sun to bounce that expensive thing for full cost (normally blue sun would use the reduced cost if breaker bay was still rezzed, unless you spent a turn bouncing breaker bay first)"

Netrunner,3dhpqu,MrSmith2,0,Thu Jul 16 18:13:39 2015 UTC,"No, because use of the gun and use of test ground would be happening in the same paid ability window, and since it is the runner's turn they have priority. If they run on HQ click one and install the gun click 2, then their immediate use of the gun would have priority before you could test ground to derez anything.  EDIT: I was wrong.

Netrunner,3dhpqu,MagnumNopus,2,Thu Jul 16 13:52:50 2015 UTC,"Since the gun requires clicks to use, in your example the corp could use test ground in the paid ability window between the gun installation and use."

Netrunner,3dhpqu,MagnumNopus,4,Thu Jul 16 14:06:22 2015 UTC,I do not think this is correct. Similar to how you cannot spend a click mid run to activate MO or paintbrush. You cannot use S&W in the paid ability window after a successful run. You have to wait until the next click to take click actions.
Netrunner,3dhpqu,azb95,2,Thu Jul 16 17:32:46 2015 UTC,"I thought that was due to a rule on not being able to spend clicks during the resolution of other clicks.  I have further reviewed and found that I am in fact wrong. Abilities with click costs are still classified as paid abilities, but there is a specific exception that paid abilities with click costs can only be used as actions.  Ancur page with paid ability rules  From Core Rulebook Page 11 Column 2 Sidebar   Paid Abilities  Some card abilities have trigger costs that a player must pay before the effect of the ability can be resolved. These abilities are called paid abilities. A card's trigger cost is always listed in its text box before the effect, following the format ""cost: effect.""  The most common costs are spending clicks (Click), spending credits (Credit), trashing the card (Trash), and spending hosted counters.   and from Core Rulebook Page 21 Column 1 Paragraph 5:   Paid abilities can be triggered at the beginning of each turn, before and after each player action, and at certain points during a run, unless the ability requires a click, in which case it must be triggered as an action. An example of a paid ability is the card Magnum Opus, which reads, ""[Click]: Gain 2 [Credit]."""

I don't know when the last time is you played against/as 'classic' HB EtF glacier/FA, but those Campaigns stack up in HQ. Running Test Ground to derez them for more cash just makes them more of a target and if you want to run an Executive Boot Camp or Tech Startup thing you'll end up using the same amount of slots and some influence for practically the same thing.

As well as clarifications:   A card is only considered to have been advanced when the Corp has spent 1 click and 1 credit on the action of advancing it. Placing or moving advancement tokens to a card is not considered advancing the card. Non-Resolvable Abilities Conditional abilities resolve after meeting their trigger  condition. However, if the game state advances past the trigger  condition due to simultaneous effects or a chain reaction, then  the triggered ability cannot be resolved Security Testing is used on HQ and the Runner plays an Account Siphon.

The ""Trash 1 program"" effect a lot of ice has is also more streamlined, and we don't have to worry that Tennin decides to put advancement tokens on cards in hand or the like (not that we ever could, but now it's directly from the rules).  HOWEVER! Industrial Genomics now only increases trash cost on installed cards and Scrubber/Whizzard can only use their credits to trash installed cards.   If this is unintended, FFG should learn to think harder before they make these general sweeping rules changes. If it is intended, it's a huge nerf to all 3 cards. But on the plus side, Skulljack just got comparatively better? (Skulljack specifies all cards).  Edit: And NRE now only works on installed cards. This I believe is intended.

Kim: Specifies ""operation"". Does this count as ""otherwise noted""?  If the answer to all these questions are ""yes"", then the only affected cards are Whizzard and Scrubber. Could be worse. Skulljack has now gone from ""sometimes better, mostly worse Scrubber that's not a resource"" to ""worse scrubber, but works on centrals"". Intendedness: Possibly?  Last Edit(?): /u/CitizenBadger said:   Regarding Scubber and Whizzard, neither affect the card being trashed. The ability to trash a card is on the card itself. They just provide credits which you can spend toward that card's innate trash ability. Neither one has an ability which affects cards. In play or otherwise. Simply resources you can use to pay select costs.   If we're buying this line of reasoning as well, all is saved! Good job guys, crisis averted!  Edit: I lied about that being the last edit.

Netrunner,3dfc0x,CitizenBadger,5,Wed Jul 15 22:47:21 2015 UTC,"You're welcome.  As a logic exercise, say you have Gordian Blade installed and during a run encounter Quandary. When you spend 1C on the Break a Code Gate Subroutine are you affecting Gordian Blade? No, you have spent a resource to use the card's ability which then affects the ICE encountered.  In another case, if you announce you are playing Sure Gamble from hand and spend 5C, does this affect Sure Gamble? No, again you're simply spending the resources required to pay for the card.  Recurring credits function like regular credits with the caveat that the card which generates them specifies what those resources can be used for. So the ability of Scrubber and Whizzard directly affects their recurring credits only. Which is why if you Cerebral Static Whizzard he can no longer spend his credits until Cerebral Static is trashed, since you no longer have the text instructing you as to the manner they can be spent as per the game rules.  Touching on Edward Kim this FAQ doesn't affect him. As Operations explicitly cannot ever be installed by the game rules. So given his ability states to trash an Operation, this precludes the need to specify installed/uninstalled game state and therefore satisfies the condition of 'as otherwise noted'.  Genomics is more grey as you could construct an argument either way since 'each' could mean increase the trash cost of each [installed] card or, as has been played to this point, simply each card. However I believe the intent of the ability is clear. And while it is a fun deck and can be quite strong, Genomics is by no means setting the world on fire. So it wouldn't need a nerf by subjecting it to this FAQ update. I feel we'll see this later clarified by someone at FFG confirming that when it says the trash cost of each card truly means just that."

Netrunner,3dfc0x,BinarySecond,1 point,Thu Jul 16 13:17:15 2015 UTC,"You are confused. The ruling refers to people who are late to a match. It is obvious that somebody who has totally left from the tournament would be dropped from the tournament.  If somebody is 10 minutes late to a round, they are forcefully removed from the tournament in addition to losing that round. Like RS14-2 said below, in Magic you are only dropped from the tourney if you don't show up by the end of the round which makes more sense."
Netrunner,3dfc0x,BinarySecond,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:29:27 2015 UTC,"I think Magic does it pretty reasonably. At 10 minutes, they get a match loss. They're only dropped if they're still missing at the end of the round."

Netrunner,3dg53z,Rejusu,3,Thu Jul 16 01:52:25 2015 UTC,Why? The only reason Breaking News is included is because it can be scored out of hand as it's a 2-1. But if every agenda in your deck is an astro every one after the first is a 2-2. And ultimately you still need to score four agendas to win and the runner needs to steal four. Only it's now slightly harder for them as you have one less agenda card in your deck. Astro has always been NBNs most useful agenda and if you could run an agenda suite that was nothing but Astro I guarantee everyone would.

I'm not saying it's perfect but if your aim is to just burn through as much as your deck in a single turn as Geist then 15 Peddlers and 30 gang members is probably the best you can do. If all you hit is gang members on the peddlers then you can still clear 20 cards with your four clicks. More, the more peddlers you hit.  Or y'know just run 45 peddlers out of any Anarch deck and chain them into each other until you run out of cards. Ooh, and include one Levy and one Same Old Thing so you can do it twice!"

Netrunner,3df8fi,nialbima,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:33:39 2015 UTC,"Not relying on the cloud breakers to get in (ie, having Corroder, Zu.13 and Faerie) means that I don't really need them to get up to strength in order to make sure I get in. Dyson is a card that is nice to see about halfway through the game when I want to pull back on the aggro a bit and build state, allowing me to cache more breakers in play. However, it's not a necessary card by any means since clone chip/street peddler can act as spare memory for the disposables, bringing them into play when I need them rather than having them take up memory beforehand.  If Akamatsu Memchip was in faction, I'd probably run 2 of those instead of the one Dyson, since 6 mem is almost certainly enough to have the cloud strong (5 breakers and 1 crescentus. You don't often need to break anything over 5 strength and when you do, crescentusing it that same run is likely to make the corp farther behind than you) and 1 credit to install is super cheap compared to the 3 from Dyson. Since it's not, I run the 1-of Dyson and install it if I feel the game is going to become a slugfest.  I think I've installed it something like 2 times in 10 games? Activating the cloud ability on the breakers is definitely not necessary to make them useful, as most taxing ICE lives in the 4-5 strength range."

I was looking at crowbar + passport and wondering whether/how it could be an efficient way to get past Tollbooth or Lotus Field on a remote. Are they still useful in the way you outlined above if you only see like one of them?    How many other breakers are you running? The first part (enabling your run events early game) is really a function of just having a crapload of ice breakers in your deck. If you're running 2x Corroder 1x Breach, 1x Passport 3x Crowbar and 3x Faerie, you're still only running 10 breakers and you're being forced to pay 4inf for Corroder and have Breach in your deck (not the worst idea, but still less than ideal). You could run more special orders or some Overminds as other methods of enabling your early run events, but those have their own costs in speed and money. B&E feels like a really good fit for Geist since they're cheap and fast.  For the second point, you definitely don't need all of the breakers to make them valuable as functional non-resource economy. 3x regular breakers plus 1-2 B&E is a neat rig, allowing you to pass Tollbooth for 3 when it would really help, and neatly they all fit in without extra link or memory beyond Desperado. I'd say if you want to run passport and don't want to spend inf on a flexible code gate solution, running 3xCrowbar isn't a bad way to go. Just don't expect them to help you too much in enabling the early game, and also be aware that you're signaling to the corp that they can tax you out of code gates by baiting your runs. This is less of an issue if you're also running clone chips."

The main issue with these breakers is that they are too weak. During a game, they rarely get to more than 5 or 6 strength, and they collectively get weaker every time they are used.

Netrunner,3de1f8,JohnQK,0,Thu Jul 16 12:59:14 2015 UTC,"Okay let me rephrase: how often do you have to break 5 or 6 strength ICE over the course of a single game?  The fact is that while there are plenty of high strength ICE out there that's in regular use the majority of your time will be spent slogging through ICE in the 0-4 strength range. Heck the reason Katman was so popular a while back was because of the predominance of strength 4 ICE in the meta. High strength ICE is costly and thus used sparingly. Yes there's a lot of high strength ICE (though I feel you've inflated your numbers, I'd say perhaps only fifteen of them are common enough to pose a threat) but you're more likely to find a corp running three Eli than three Tollbooths.  At any rate if you're sitting scared trying to get your breakers up to 5-6 when the ICE over HQ is more likely to be Enigma than Tollbooth then you're doing it wrong. And if they do have an Archer (and it's easy to see when one might be coming as it'll be proceeded by a scored HoTay)? That's when you install grappling hook."
Netrunner,3de1f8,Rejusu,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:53:28 2015 UTC,"The scoring server and the second layer of a central server are usually going to have a large Ice in front of it.   By the time enough of the cloud breakers are installed to reliably get through a small ice (and only get through it once), the big ice are affordable."
Netrunner,3de1f8,JohnQK,0,Thu Jul 16 15:12:14 2015 UTC,"You're thinking about this far too fatalistically rather than realistically. When nearly a quarter of your deck is breakers how likely do you think it is that you won't see a couple pretty quickly? I've played this deck a lot lately and can tell you that reliably getting a few breakers out to deal with small ICE is never an issue. In fact getting the right type of breaker is a far bigger problem than getting them to a useful strength. Secondly how rich do you think the corp is? There just isn't any way for them to rez a lot of big ICE quickly. And you exploit that by applying pressure in multiple areas. Sure if the entire aim of the game was to get into one specific server then your argument could work. They could just rez a piece of big ICE and lock you out. But Netrunner is a more complex game than that. Think they've got an agenda in that server and some big ICE over it? Hit them with an account siphon. Either they rez something big over HQ and subsequently can't afford to rez something big over their scoring server or they rez something small which you can get through and siphon them. The end result is the same either way: they can't rez their scoring server ICE and you can get in. See the thing is that not every run has to be successful to be effective. And the opposite is also true, not every successful run is effective.  But either way the quickest way to understand what these can do is to play with them. You'll never get anywhere though if you focus on the worst case scenarios instead of looking at what is likely."

If you are especially good at putting on pressure while not really putting on any pressure, then you can probably time it well with just siphon. Vamp to me seems like the easier play. Forged activation order can help you put pressure on while not actually running and breaking ice, maybe? I'd rather just vamp"

Netrunner,3de1f8,Rejusu,1 point,Thu Jul 16 13:00:35 2015 UTC,"I would guess that their value, beyond an all-in build, depends on how your deck reaches 2 link. While its true that criminal often has an incomplete rig for most of the game, I'm also not sure how much value a 2 strength 1-time use breaker really is, at least from a deckslot perspective. Shiv is perhaps the hardest one to get behind, since in many ways it is an inferior faerie, and for the amount of setup it takes for shiv to outshine faerie, you could also be playing switchblade.  I could see running 1 of the B&E decoders to get past a late game lotus field, but its hard for me to see how these fit into a normal 45 card deck.  Now, if we get a 50/55 card criminal, supposing a comparably good ID to Valencia with a link, then I think we have the space to start talking about these breakers, probably in conjunction with the Dyson drip economy.

Netrunner,3de1f8,ErikTwice,1 point,Thu Jul 16 13:13:36 2015 UTC,I disagree. Being about to bypass Tollbooth or Troll or any ICE in general for cheap is always a good thing.
Netrunner,3de1f8,BlueSapphyre,0,Thu Jul 16 13:51:53 2015 UTC,"Probably the best of the three, just by virtue of having the same efficiency, but for the most taxing sub-type of ICE to break. The suite is now viable, though I'm not sure anyone has found the best way to justify all of the deck slots and set-up time necessary to make these sing. Centrals-only breakers plus these for remotes, either out of Geist for the draw-efficiency or Andromeda for the faster set-up, seems like the obvious call, and it saves influence for other shenanigans, but again it's just a lot of your deck going to breakers."

Tony please, the point I'm making is that you use them to ignore a piece of ICE (meaning, without losing tempo) just like inside job does. Of course it's not a perfect analogy, but while inside job only works with the first encountered piece of ICE, you can decide when to use ""Shiv""."

Netrunner,3defrp,lm721,16,Wed Jul 15 17:04:08 2015 UTC,"It's not post-H&P, but Clone Chips are as close to an auto-include as there is for Runners.  I think Street Peddler may reach that point eventually (especially at 1 inf), but we'll see.  Architect and Tollbooth are probably the most splashed non-Eli ICE around.  Beyond that, I think you need to go faction-specific.  I think Oaktown Renovation is going to be in 90% of Weyland decks going forward.  Pup is in practically every Jinteki deck, same for Sweeps Week in NBN."
Netrunner,3defrp,hbarSquared,3,Wed Jul 15 17:54:51 2015 UTC,"I mean, like Jackson is in almost every corp deck regardless of faction, much like Eli. Corroders tend to be in a lot of runner decks regardless of faction (but it's a core card so everyone has at least 2 copies of it). As you mentioned, clone chips are there for runners and Architect and tollbooth for corps. Are there any cards like those post H&P where regardless of faction you NEED to play them?"
Netrunner,3defrp,tenderbranson301,3,Wed Jul 15 18:02:34 2015 UTC,"ASH and Caprice are extremely common for any corp glacier deck. Also, Same old thing (C&C) is in SO many runner decks."

There are plenty of cards that are necessary for certain archetypes, though. More generally, the Baby in The Valley is a great generalist card for the runner, and True Colors has Sweeps Week, which every NBN deck wants. Pretty much every Weyland deck uses Project Atlas (What Lies Ahead) too."
Netrunner,3defrp,BlueSapphyre,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:03:28 2015 UTC,This was more what I was asking; I get that certain archetypes will require certain cards which won't change until sets come out.

Netrunner,3defrp,subpoenaduece,2,Wed Jul 15 18:29:13 2015 UTC,"Jackson is so ubiquitous because he fixes an auto-loss situation, HQ agenda floods. There's no other aspects of the game that need shoring up as much as that one scenario, so that's why it's the only ""auto-include""."

Netrunner,3defrp,jkopplin,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:23:52 2015 UTC,"iirc, Ahmed Abbasi has said they should be considered for any build. It's a must trash for the runner because 2 credits/turn is so strong good. so even if you put it in a mildly taxing server, it's golden."
Netrunner,3defrp,Eridine,1 point,Thu Jul 16 11:19:17 2015 UTC,Interesting. In all the tournaments I've participated in and different people I've played I don't know if I've ever seen Sundew played outside of Replicating perfection. It works so well in that archetype. But I don't see it being worth the influence out of faction or doing much good other than annoying the runner.
Netrunner,3dfbwe,BoomFrog,3,Wed Jul 15 20:45:58 2015 UTC,"I feel like you want to make sure its a card that will be played in multiples, and they will want to play early and it will slow them down to delay playing it.  Criminals: Account Siphon. This can lose you the game if played early, and marketing negates it's power.  Anarch: Parasite.  Every anarch plays it, and many plan to play it early and often with clone chips and deja'vu.  Vs Noise I might name cache.  Shaper: SMC.  Again every shapper plays it, although admittedly some only play 2x, but they will recur it with clone chips fairly often as well.  No early SMC will slow down their early game."
Netrunner,3dfbwe,Mark5n,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:52:57 2015 UTC,"Wouldn't Account Siphon be helped by Targeting Marketing to some extent? Corp has 0 credits, runner plays Account Siphon and successfully runs. Now the corp has 5 credits and the runner has 10."
Netrunner,3dfbwe,Bananaman89,2,Fri Jul 17 14:49:54 2015 UTC,"I'd much rather have 5 credits then 0 as the corp. Cortex lock+Batty or twins can kill the runner for 4 credits. 0 credits just says, ""come right in"".   Plus you can spend the 10 during the run and maybe leave them with nothing."
Netrunner,3dfbwe,Jusctsch,2,Fri Jul 17 14:57:36 2015 UTC,"It really depends on their ID, but (especially if they don't mulligan) sure gamble is always a great choice."
Netrunner,3dfbwe,ayylmao31,2,Wed Jul 15 20:54:19 2015 UTC,"I was thinking that, but they can just sit on their sure gambles and play their other economy cards instead.  Once the first agenda is stolen, then they cash in those saved sure gambles.  I don't think it hurts enough, you need to name something less replaceable."
Netrunner,3dfbwe,ErikTwice,2,Wed Jul 15 21:01:23 2015 UTC,"That being said, not being able to play an early Sure Gamble will definitely slow the runner down. If you're planning on rushing, it's not a bad option."
Netrunner,3dfbwe,xanarax,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:35:54 2015 UTC,In a competitive setting I wouldn't play the current until I had ICE.  Though if I was forced to:  Anarch: Medium Reina: Lamprey  Criminal: Account Siphon  Shaper: Prepaid VoicePad or Professional Contacts. Magnum Opus if Chaos Theory.
Netrunner,3dfbwe,Vysetron,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:50:19 2015 UTC,"Generally, I would play Targeted Marketing only in decks that can force a very specific play but generally you either name the breaker they need to get in or-if you are going for a flatline- the card that they'll play to fight economically (Normally Cache or Parasite)"
Netrunner,3dfbwe,neoreadinggrid,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:58:08 2015 UTC,"Sure Gamble, unless it's noise then I'd pick cache.  Account Siphon can be pretty funny because it can give them money to steal that they might not have been able to."

Netrunner,3dewxf,noisex,3,Wed Jul 15 19:03:01 2015 UTC,The ice strength is lowered by 1 for every counter on parasite. When you encounter it you may choose to spend (remove) counters from datasucker to further lower the strength. As soon as it gets to zero it dies due to parasite..   so although datasucker only temporarily lowers ice strength this works very well with parasite.   Clear?
Netrunner,3dewxf,Imrahill,4,Wed Jul 15 19:08:04 2015 UTC,Reiterate ice is only trashed when it's strength reaches zero.
Netrunner,3dewxf,Imrahill,8,Wed Jul 15 19:09:03 2015 UTC,"and parasite is on it.  Normally being at 0 strength doesn't trash ice, thats a special thing that parasite does."
Netrunner,3dewxf,RestarttGaming,4,Wed Jul 15 19:45:15 2015 UTC,"The use of datasucker will bring the Ice down to 0, and so the Ice will be trashed. It could be reduced by datasucker, wyrm, ice carver, etc.  You do have to ""use"" (remove) a counter from datasucker every time you use it to lower strength."
Netrunner,3dewxf,JohnQK,3,Wed Jul 15 19:09:22 2015 UTC,"Parasite trashes the ice it is hosted on if that ice is ever strength 0 or less.  This is regardless of why it gets to strength 0.  you play parasite on a strength 0 ice?  trash it immediately.  You are encountering the ice parasite is on and ice carver/scrubed/wyrm/datasucker brings it to 0 or less?  trash it.  Parasite is hosted one one piece of ice.  its counters just build until wiped or that ice is trashed (in which case parasite is trashed).  The counters on parasite only apply to that one ice it's hosted on.  Datasucker uses it's counters.  Datasucker doesn't effect ice until you remove a counter, in which case it gives the ice you are currently encountering -1 strength for the rest of that encounter only.   So if you run on a sever that has 1) eli 2) caduceus with a parasite with two counters on it and datasucker has 3 counters, you encounter eli first.   eli is still strength 4.  If you remove two datascuker counters, eli is now strength2 for this encounter.  after you pass eli, you'll have one datasucker counter left, and eli will go back to strength 4. you'll encounter caduceus at strength 1 (since parasite is reducing it's strength by 2), and can spend your last counter to bring it to strength 0, in which case it is immediately trashed, and you dont have to break it."
Netrunner,3dewxf,RestarttGaming,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:18:37 2015 UTC,"Thanks, perfectly clear. One last thing: does parasite go in the heap when trashed or I can't pick it up anymore with cards like Deja Vù?"
Netrunner,3dewxf,Imrahill,2,Wed Jul 15 20:13:50 2015 UTC,"Parasite goes in your trash when the ice is trashed (either by parasites ability or the Corp installing over), so then you can retrieve it with deja vu or clone chip etc.."
Netrunner,3dewxf,RestarttGaming,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:50:49 2015 UTC,"All runner cards go into the heap when trashed.  Trashing is specifically going into the heap.  Cards that don't go into the heap will specifically say so (like hyperdriver doesn't get trashed, it specifically says it removes itself from the game).  So yes, you'd be able to get it back with Deja Vu.  Also, notice parasite is a virus, so you can get it TWO parasites (or one parasite and one other virus) back from the heap with just ONE deja vu"

It's REALLY fun.       I elected not to use it, but if you swapped a Legwork for an HQI, this deck could make excellent use of Street Peddler. If you do, you might need a Levy, though.      You could also maybe cut Creeper and add a few Faeries, they're pretty stellar with super Clone Chips that draw you cards."
Netrunner,3ddpbn,nialbima,1 point,Wed Jul 15 14:40:07 2015 UTC,"Creeper and Alias as your Killers? This will hurt a lot if you find a Tsurugi on a remote or a Komainu. Even an Architect on a central will bleed you dry.  Other than that it seems ok. The economy is a bit predictable. Card draw seems a bit low. Sure, you get card draw by using trash ability, but how are you going to draw THOSE cards in the first place?"
Netrunner,3ddpbn,Krystman,2,Wed Jul 15 13:50:07 2015 UTC,"I went through my entire deck last night with a different version of it that used the B&E breakers, so I added the Symmetrical Visage to improve the draw econ.  But you're right with creeper and Alias, I think I'd swap the alias for 3 faeries and drop 1x fall guy.

Netrunner,3dbm0r,myth_builder,1 point,Wed Jul 15 14:04:54 2015 UTC,"On the side of the players? The commentators? Please explain.  I thought it was an excellent example of a Corp getting into the Runner's head and slowly grinding them out. That's pretty atypical for a high-level competitive match, where both players are on even footing until one tilts. Dan's amazing with his Andy deck and even he was really struggling here. On top of it, it's a good showcase of Minh's PE deck which came out of nowhere in a Worlds that was threatening to filled with Andy vs. NEH."
Netrunner,3dbm0r,gumOnShoe,2,Wed Jul 15 16:58:30 2015 UTC,"They both make serious mistakes by taking credits when they shouldn't; and it's arguable that when Lukas gives Dan the rollback that he messed up, and that was the call that decided the game. If it had been in the remote instead, maybe minh would have gotten it from the remote and not died on an HQ run he wouldn't have been that tempted to make.  They are both excellent players, but at the end of Day 2 they aren't playing well. And they both ran decks that the runner meta had not adjusted to. There was a lack of parasite at that tournament and criminal was arguably a bad call (though without lady & clot, shaper was certainly harder to pilot).  I the reason that runner piloting was so bad in the final round was because it was bad. Not installing singleton mimic vs Jinteki? Idiotic. Serious mistakes. Giving up cards for credits doesn't make sense in criminal."

Netrunner,3dcsh9,wakkawakkaaaa,20,Wed Jul 15 06:53:22 2015 UTC,"By looking through his deck he is effectively undoing the randomization of all his prior shuffling, because he has re-obtained information about the order of his cards, and then is following it up with a substandard shuffle. A ""sufficiently randomized"" deck does not necessarily mean that duplicates aren't next to each other. In a sufficiently randomized deck, the chances of seeing ""hedgefund, hedgefund"" should be just as likely as seeing ""hedgefund, icewall"".    Going through and splitting duplicates up like that actually de-randomizes things because then whenever you draw a card you can be reasonably sure that the next card isn't the same as the one you just drew, which gives you information about your deck that you shouldn't otherwise have. Information like ""oh, I just drew an agenda, that means I don't need to worry about rezzing ice on R&D this turn because there aren't going to be any agendas for a few more cards because I went through my deck and made sure that the agendas were evenly distributed throughout the deck""  If he's going to look through his deck and move specific cards around, you better make sure that he fully reshuffles his deck afterward."

Netrunner,3dcsh9,_Pandaclysm,2,Thu Jul 16 01:09:46 2015 UTC,"Also in a tournament setting its considered polite to let your opponent cut or even shuffle your deck.

Netrunner,3dcsh9,Sam_Man,14,Wed Jul 15 19:19:10 2015 UTC,who will look through his deck and shift stacked duplicates around   Either he randomizes his deck after that with good shuffling; so shifting around the duplicates does nothing.  Or he does not randomizes his deck after that; in this case one might argue that putting certain cards at certain positions in your deck is cheating.

Netrunner,3dcsh9,Xenasis,3,Wed Jul 15 15:13:30 2015 UTC,"Riffle shuffle doesn't have to be performed in a way that damages cards.  Edit: Also, I think the mash shuffle has a better chance of damaging sleeves.  Willingdone's Video was posted elsewhere, so I removed the link."
Netrunner,3dcsh9,Xenasis,-7,Wed Jul 15 15:22:40 2015 UTC,:S I'm skeptical. I would call a judge over to ask them to shuffle my deck in my opponent's name due to improper handling of my property.  EDIT: LOL someone downvoted this without saying why. xD The only reason you'd downvote this is if you're one of those people who want to sloppily shuffle someone's deck.
Netrunner,3dcsh9,Xenasis,3,Wed Jul 15 16:03:06 2015 UTC,"You can riffle without damaging sleeves. Riffling doesn't damage cards as long as they're sleeved. One way to do this is to not riffle the corners of the cards, just 'drop' them at the right time.  I'd personally mash someone's deck, but I'd prefer someone riffle shuffle mine than not shuffle it at all.  Either way, this is a bit of a silly argument. What constitutes handling your property badly? What about if you took this to the extreme and said that your opponent wasn't allowed to shuffle your deck, just in case they damage your cards? Riffle shuffling isn't synonymous with destroying your cards, and in fact it remains the best way to randomise a deck, and as such can be done without damaging the deck.   Riffle shuffling and mash shuffling are basically the only good ways to randomise a deck. Sleeves will eventually split. It's not the person shuffling your deck's ""fault"", it's just going to happen with time after shuffling a lot.  Addendum: That being said, there is a limit to what you can do with other peoples's cards, obviously. However, any card damage or anything like that is not a result of riffle shuffling, it's a result of that person being a dick."
Netrunner,3dcsh9,Blamsquad,-1,Wed Jul 15 19:18:46 2015 UTC,Shuffling that potentially bends sleeves or cards is not ok with me. I'm concerned with you saying this method is best for shuffling. I hate to be a prick but do you have anything to support this claim? Sleeves don't have to split. Through pile shuffling it is insuring that each card moves away from previously adjacent cards with each shuffle while preventing bends and edge to edge collisions on sleeves.  This being said I do not let players do more than cut my deck. If they want to shuffle I grab a judge to do it. This way they have their opportunity to have my deck randomized while I don't have to deal with people potentially damaging my personal property. If they are allowed to have my deck shuffled I am allowed the same right to have it done by a judge.  I don't play competitively so I don't mind conceding the game if they demand to shuffle. I typically avoid matches with people like that.
Netrunner,3dcsh9,Kusatteiru,2,Wed Jul 15 19:51:04 2015 UTC,"Shuffling that potentially bends sleeves or cards is not ok with me.   All shuffling 'potentially bends sleeves or cards'. Playing with cards 'potentially bends sleeves or cards'. Unless you have a Netrunner collection to just look at it, you're 'at risk' of bending sleeves/cards. In reality, it's not actually going to happen if you play with them.   I'm concerned with you saying this method is best for shuffling. I hate to be a prick but do you have anything to support this claim?   There's plenty of sources I could cite, but there's a nice video that's pretty easy to digest about the subject here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AxJubaijQbI  A mash shuffle is basically equivalent to a riffle shuffle, they're both the same if done 'perfectly'.   Through pile shuffling it is insuring that each card moves away from previously adjacent cards with each shuffle while preventing bends and edge to edge collisions on sleeves.   Pile shuffling is not shuffling. It is not random, it is not pseudorandom. It is deterministic re-ordering of a deck. You can very easily pile shuffle a stacked deck into either itself (you can always pile shuffle something into itself) or an optimal pattern.  Pile shuffling is not random (and not really a 'shuffle') and should not be lauded as a replacement for a real shuffle.   I would be uncomfortable with playing against somebody who doesn't want to shuffle their deck adequately before a game.    insuring that each card moves away from previously adjacent cards   Meaning it's impossible to get the exact same deck two times in a row. If you're ensuring things about your deck other than ""I don't know what order the cards are in"", chances are you've not shuffled it."
Netrunner,3dcsh9,12inchrecord,0,Wed Jul 15 20:20:47 2015 UTC,"I am not saying there is a risk. I am minimizing that risk. You have zero right to handle my personal property in a way that I don't see fit. The rules say I have to allow my opponent to shuffle my deck. I will always comply. Luckily, I don't play competitively so I don't lose anything from conceding. So If someone is about to shuffle my cards in a way that I don't like I can concede right there. If my opponent considers that a victory then by all means."
Netrunner,3dcsh9,Kusatteiru,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:29:56 2015 UTC,"I am minimizing that risk   This is a really silly argument. A better way to minimise it further would be to never play Netrunner.   The rules say I have to allow my opponent to shuffle my deck. I will always comply.    You just said that you won't let your opponent shuffle your deck (bar a pile shuffle, which is not a shuffle) though?    So If someone is about to shuffle my cards in a way that I don't like I can concede right there. If my opponent considers that a victory then by all means.   If you're not prepared to adequately randomise your deck then you're not playing Netrunner by the rules (that is: cheating). I do not want to play against somebody who is intentionally subverting the rules.   It's not that I'd ""consider it a victory"", I sat down to play Netrunner by its rules, and if my opponent does not want to play Netrunner by the rules then I don't want to play with them. You should not expect people to want to play Netrunner with modified rules and they are not at fault for wanting to play Netrunner by its rules.  To me this is kind of like if someone sits down to play chess, asks if they can have a modified army, then gets angry at me for saying no. I wouldn't ""consider that a victory"" either, it's just kinda sad.  Continuing this discussion is fruitless. You don't want to properly randomise your cards before a game of Netrunner (as per the rules), and I don't want to play against somebody who doesn't want to properly randomise their cards. That's the end of it."
Netrunner,3dcsh9,Blamsquad,0,Wed Jul 15 20:37:27 2015 UTC,"Well the goal is to play while minimizing the risk. If I wasn't playing I wouldn't be having this conversation.  Pile shuffling is shuffling which is legal in every card tournament I have attended. So whether it meets your description or not isn't the issue at hand.  Again, I follow the rules. The rules allow for pile shuffling.  Your analogy doesn't apply here. I follow the rules. I give my opponent the opportunity to cut or pile shuffle until they are satisfied. I am not asking to use a ""modified army"" I am asking that you don't damage my set that I strive to keep nice.  You cite the rules and I do the same. Any time there has been an issue a judge has been summoned. All I say is that I don't wish for my cards to be bent. My wishes have to be respected because no one has the right to damage my personal property."
Netrunner,3dcsh9,hiryuu1115,0,Wed Jul 15 20:51:10 2015 UTC,So I watched this video. Statistically speaking I completely agree with this. It's clear and the data collection method is sound. I would like to bring up the fact that riffle shuffling bends cards. This is potentially card marking. Say you're a long time Netrunner player. I'm sure there are some cards that you would be using a bit more frequently than others. If everyone is riffle shuffling your deck. How much of a curvature would those more frequently played cards have? Of course your answer is going to be it's negligible. It has to be otherwise you're agreeing with me that riffling while better for pure randomization also damages cards causing some cards to be more identifiable than others. It's just a thought though.
Netrunner,3dcsh9,hiryuu1115,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:40:32 2015 UTC,"You're not allowed marked cards, regardless of how they're marked. Riffle shuffling does not mark cards, and you I don't know what picture you have in your head of somebody bending their cards all the way to riffle, but that's not the reality at all.  I don't riffle shuffle my decks, I mash shuffle them, but I've never noticed absolutely any card or sleeve marking because I'm not an idiot about the way I shuffle."

Netrunner,3dcsh9,Clamatius,1 point,Wed Jul 15 11:41:33 2015 UTC,Riffle 7 FTW at the start.  Less riffles required as the game goes on due to a shortening deck.  Sometimes I might do a little less and combo it with overhand shuffles then a cut.  Sorta depends on my mood I guess!
Netrunner,3dcsh9,Xenasis,1 point,Wed Jul 15 12:27:55 2015 UTC,yeah that's why I riffle shuffle x7.  as for when people mash shuffle against me.  I just cut the top X cards.  like if that individual you played shuffled like that against me.  if in a tournament I'd call a judge and have him shuffle the deck.  then I'd cut the top 8 cards off the top.  in casual play. I'd just cut the top 8.  we use to have someone do that locally when I was playing l5r.  and the cut the top X cards was our response to him.  not just mine. the entire pool that played against him.  It has become a running joke.

Some combination of mash, overhand and riffles to get a good randomization and I'm done.   For my opponent's deck, usually a few mash shuffles if I think he's been sloppy, a simple cut if it seems okay. Never a riffle because I know some people are very protective of their deck.   I don't mind if they mash shuffle a bit, but I'd definitely say something if they were being really careless or bending cards."

Netrunner,3dcsh9,xanarax,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:54:53 2015 UTC,Mana weaving makes sense. Wish it was standard practice. I've watched so many pros scrub out from simple floods or screws.

Netrunner,3dcsh9,Maert,2,Thu Jul 16 00:59:03 2015 UTC,I actually think I see more people get impatient with how long I shuffle for.
Netrunner,3dcsh9,AnalysisSitus,2,Wed Jul 15 17:11:29 2015 UTC,"a couple mash shuffles   Unless you're understating things, this probably isn't enough. You should do about 10 mash shuffles. Overhand shuffles are relatively useless as is the pile shuffle, but it's understandable if you pile shuffle to count cards in your deck (and as long as you realise that it does not randomise a deck). I personally count cards by just counting the deck in 5s, which I think it faster, but each to their own.   who will look through his deck and shift stacked duplicates around before doing a few overhand shuffle   Yeah this is pretty much cheating. It might sound stupid, but they might not realise it's cheating, due to not understanding that drawing a hand of 5 agendas can happen with a randomised deck or something. Either way, this is cheating and intentionally fixing their deck.   If this would happen to me in a regionals or something, I would immediately call a judge.  I'd talk to this player about it, anyway. Express your concern and tell them that, whether they realise it or not, they're cheating by fixing their deck. Maybe they just haven't realised yet and need someone to talk sense into them. If they don't change their ways after that, there might be a serious problem, but I'm hoping that they will.   making me tempted to pick up his deck and do some mash shuffling.   As a rule, I pick up and mash shuffle everybody's deck after they present it to me after any shuffle. Even if I know them personally and know they'd never cheat or whatever. It gets me in the habit of doing it, so that if I ever do get paired against a cheater, we can still have a fair game of Netrunner. I'd far rather my default action be something that prevents cheating than something that allows cheaters to thrive."
Netrunner,3dcsh9,Xenasis,1 point,Wed Jul 15 14:39:23 2015 UTC,"One thing that pile shuffles do that the mash shuffles don't is separate cards that are stuck together. In a long tournament or using old sleeves, it's definitely possible for sweat or other gunk to glue cards together just a bit. But generally yeah, I agree, pile shuffles are mostly useful just for making sure your last opponent didn't actually steal your agendas, that Jackson isn't taking a nap off to the side there, no card stuck in the edge of the deckbox etc."
Netrunner,3dcsh9,magikot,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:02:18 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I've heard that before, too. It was just a bit worrying that it was grouped in with real shuffles and was in this context:   I often do a pile shuffle followed by a couple mash shuffles and some overhand shuffles to try and fully randomize my cards   I felt the need to clarify that a pile shuffle does not randomise your cards."

I'm not generally a rushdown player as you called it; but at the same time I've played against them and I've also definitely been in the position of accidentally making a mistake which I'd get pointed out to me and fix in casual play.  What I'd do is - since you have elevated suspicion - next time you see a play-error or get report of one, no matter how minor, politely but firmly remind him that in a tournament it is HIS responsibility to know the rules and maintain the game state as well as his opponent's. That ""accidents"" are understandable, but the response to said accident would be a game loss. ""I'll ignore it this one time, but please don't let this happen again.""  Three reasons for this approach: 1.) It gives him a warning which, since you have no proof of ill-intent, he definitely would deserve. 2.) It's 100% by the book; you're not abusing TO power or anything. 3.)

Mistakes are pretty common, particularly when people are playing fast due to time pressure, so I would be careful about assuming malice. Particularly if you're not issuing warnings, players may not even be aware that their play is sloppy and needs to be tightened up.

Netrunner,3dbop6,satellite_uplink,-1,Wed Jul 15 10:54:22 2015 UTC,"Really? The poor state of the Magic judge community is one of the factors that forced me out of the game. Not for any ban reasons (I am moral to a fault,) but because it became clear that enough corrupt judges existed to make playing at events like GPs and GenCon a nightmare. When an off duty judge specifically says to her opponent that he should have won a game, but she purposefully lapsed in her duties in maintaining board state so that a certain judge ruling could take effect and guarantee her the win something is wrong; a large part of the system is broken.   Even so, Magic does things well. Magic players for the most part have much greater board state awareness. If you think that a player is cheating start tracking their turn with a click tracker. Ask for them to clean up their credits, and if they won't do that start tracking their credits too. Board state awareness can solve, or at least help root out, cheating problems. And if this player is still cheating ask why? Prize support in Netrunner is awesome but has almost no monetary value. Why cheat?"
Netrunner,3dbop6,kronosdev,10,Wed Jul 15 18:47:52 2015 UTC,"Personally, I'd ask them to verbally spell out their actions clearly. (eg Draw, Draw, Hedge Fund for net four credits, install corroder for 2 credits). It really does not take long, only adding an extra 5-10 seconds to a typical 'rush turn', and it's just good sportsmanship. Also, if their credits are a messy pile or their current hand size is not easily visible, ask them to tidy that up - it's public information so obscuring it is also poor form.

I played against someone once who, due to illness, really couldn't speak much, and there was so much confusion.  You can't make any assumptions with card abilities being triggered"
Netrunner,3dbop6,ABigDumbBaby,2,Thu Jul 16 00:34:00 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I always say what I'm doing explicitly so that there's no question about my actions. I think it's courteous and friendly. One reason I always hated playing MTG was the guys who'd never say a word, just rotating and playing cards and pointing at things. Drove me crazy."
Netrunner,3dbop6,dios_Achilleus,3,Wed Jul 15 05:06:44 2015 UTC,"We have a guy who does this in Netrunner at the moment locally. We are a fresh community, so I am trying to train that out of him."
Netrunner,3dbop6,Slothmano,6,Wed Jul 15 08:57:01 2015 UTC,"A good general piece of advice for any judging issue is ""Ask a Magic judge how they would handle it"".  Magic has different rules, different situations, but the judge program in Magic is incredible and a huge part of it is about the soft skills of how to communicate to players and defuse situations without having to wield the judge hammer.  In this instance I think they would recommend having a quiet word with the player and saying ""can you please make sure you declare your actions more clearly, and that your opponent is happy with what you're doing and the game state?  I'm sure you're not doing anything untoward but because you play so quickly it's difficult to follow""  From there you've begun a friendly interaction that gives you a base to come back later if there's still issues and swing it more towards ""I doubt you're doing anything shady but the way you play makes it look like you might be"" then ""knock it off or I'll assume you're doing it on purpose and trying to cheat"".  You might also want to approach this hand-in-hand with a couple of other players who you know well and can quietly ask them to make sure they track what he is doing.  Your eyes can't be everywhere, so get more eyes.  Ultimately keep the end goal in mind, which isn't to ban a player and reduce the playerbase by one, it's to improve one player's play style so that everyone is playing fairly and enjoying the game."
Netrunner,3dbop6,satellite_uplink,1 point,Wed Jul 15 10:51:52 2015 UTC,"If we judge by results are you so sure the Magic approach is such a success? Maybe if Magic judges were more willing to ""hammer"" then that community would have less of a cheating problem than it does."
Netrunner,3dbop6,m50d,4,Wed Jul 15 11:10:45 2015 UTC,"Magic has a relatively low cheating problem, IMHO.  It's worth understanding that cheating is often a function of how much is at stake.  Why cheat at Netrunner when there's virtually nothing worth cheating to win?  In Magic the stakes are frequently much higher, and thus there's more incentive to cheat.  That said, I think cheating is very low in Magic because the judges are good.  You go to a 2,000 player GP and there might be just a few players who get in serious trouble with judges."
Netrunner,3dbop6,satellite_uplink,2,Wed Jul 15 11:14:49 2015 UTC,"The cheating problem in magic is their because of the money on the line.  Compared to other big stakes games, it's really not too bad.  Hell, I've heard competitive Chess is worse that MTG."

Some, especially those driven by their competitive instincts, may find themselves doing anything it takes to win.  I know we like to think our is community invincible from such toxicity, but players of all types are drawn to competitive card games, even the cheaters.  Netrunner is no longer the small card game it once was; the game has become quite popular, and while that is almost always for the better, a bigger population also means you get more of the lowest types.  In the future, as the TO you should warn players if you catch something.  ""Hey, you took 5 credits there; you should have only took 4.""  This not only corrects their mistake (which could have been an honest mistake) but also lets them know that you're watching them and that while their opponent might not be as attentive, you sure as hell notice these things."
Netrunner,3dbop6,breadrising,3,Wed Jul 15 04:16:27 2015 UTC,"Tell him to slow the fuck down, since if you've seen him make mistakes from rush playing, he is obviously not good enough to fairly employ that tactic.  If he pushes back, tell him it's because you think he's cheating. There's no reason to make a whole awkward situation about this. Be transparent and direct."
Netrunner,3dbop6,faintpremonition,2,Wed Jul 15 06:49:50 2015 UTC,Keep a close eye on him next tournament and remind him on his mistakes as you go try to keep him honest. If you can't well then you will have to dq him.
Netrunner,3dbop6,rosskane,2,Wed Jul 15 01:17:13 2015 UTC,"I am guilty of making some mistakes in my favor, as are most Netrunner players. The game has a lot to keep track of, and time is a very real concern that leads players to play at a pace at which they are likely to make a mistake every so often.  That being said, if this is happening regularly and the player isn't making any apparent mistakes that hurt him, (a careless player will do this, while a dishonest player might not), I would privately let local TOs know who the person in question is so they're prepared to warn the player or give them a game loss if it comes up again. A game loss would not be the end of the world for this player and it would probably keep them honest, or, in the case that they're just being unreasonably sloppy, to be more careful.  Hopefully, the upcoming FFG floor rules will give us a system for dealing with these situations. If not, Stimhack and the ANRPC are prepared to issue a supplementary TO rules and enforcement guide soon afterwards. Until then, remain vigilant."
Netrunner,3dbop6,Calc3,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:21:35 2015 UTC,"We had one guy like this who was just a nervous player in tournaments. I was TOing and I overhead him correcting missed installs or putting back credits because he either shorted himself a click or took one too many pretty often. When I got a second offense from a game of him playing a Diesel on click 5 I had to let him to know that game was over.  Luckily he agreed that his play was way too sloppy and he needed to calm down. I'd imagine you just have to take a sterner tone against someone who is a bit more childish about it. It's also the opponents responsibility to notice such mannerisms and ask them to slow down, for the good of both of  you.  I think cases like this most of the time are honest mistakes, cheaters typically won't 'play fast' and hope the opponent won't catch em sneaking in a draw or credit. That's not a very reliable way to cheat and (just guessing) a cheater in such a modestly small community as Netrunner will have to be very precise because if he gets caught he may lose his only meta.  Now if you want hear about cheaters, there was a guy who apparently played in our meta back in the first cycle (I wasn't there) who would keep a Scorched Earth and a SEA Source under his mat around HQ, and when he put his cards down to wait out the opponents turn he would slip one in. I think he played the game a grand total of like 2 months. When caught he admitted he was 'on his way out' of the game and didn't really care. Our meta never saw him again."
Netrunner,3dbop6,ayylmao31,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:01:55 2015 UTC,"I don't know if this is bad practice, but my first notion is that there's no reason why you can't issue a warning after the fact, something along the lines of ""I noticed on game day that you like to play fast, which is fine, except you sometimes made mistakes. I'm sure you understand that it's really important to maintain the game's hidden information, so be more careful in the future"". I would think that it's important that whatever you say gets the message across that whoever it was didn't exactly get away with it and that they'll be more closely watched, but on the surface has a certain amount of plausable deniability, so that whether he or she cheated or not, we can all assume it was just a mistake as long as it doesn't happen again.  If you catch this person at it again, mistake or cheating, it's grounds for disqualification."

I just find Netrunner very repetitive, to the extent that even if we played two games with decks that have 45/49 different cards I'd feel they're basically very similar underneath that skin.    I probably have to face RDI/Makers Eye/Medium/Keyhole.  I probably have to face Vamp/Siphon/Legwork.  I probably have to face a combination of Ice whose abilities don't really matter as they're just a number of credits I have to spend to go by.  Behind those Ice I probably have to face a couple of Upgrades who reduce the game even more to a credits race or add a frustrating level of pseudo-randomness with psi that most likely just requires me to burn more credits to try again.  Install breakers every game (often the same or similar breakers), install Ice every game (often the same or similar Ice), generate money (often with the same economy cards), try to create scoring windows (often with the same or similar upgrades).  Rinse, wash, repeat.  A lot of people like the game so it's obviously doing a lot right, but it's not right for me.  I think I'm going to try and get in on the relaunched AGOT LCG at the ground floor, I played the HBO version and liked the mechanics of it a lot."

That said, any game can be reduced to a few lines of simplification. I wouldn't read too much into, or get bummed out by, this deconstruction. What makes Netrunner (or any card game) fun are the decisions involved, and even after hundreds of hours of play every game still has lots of non-trivial decisions."

Often times I will place my hand on the table and watch them and see how they are thinking to figure out where they are weak. This is a game with hidden information that you can discern if you watch  your opponent.

If you start going down the mindgames route you can wind up at a virtual coin toss of ""I think you think I think this, but what if you've already thought that I think you think I think this?""  In the end calculating the risks/rewards of plays is 'more right more of the time'."

Netrunner,3dcxt0,Calc3,2,Wed Jul 15 16:59:44 2015 UTC,"Is it possible the repetitiveness you're feeling would crop up when playing any game highly competitively? If you only play Tier 1 vs Tier 1, in most games this rules out the majority of cards and strategies and you do see the same stuff over and over.  For me, while I do show up at tournaments with my best decks and play to win, most of my favorite moments in Netrunner have been casual nights working on weird Tier 2 brews with my friends and experimenting with different ideas. Surrounding the space of ""optimal"" decks is a giant playground of decks that do something different and are almost good enough to make it.  I can't comment to whether AGOT will be better, but I would imagine it would start out with even less diversity and room for creativity with the initially smaller card pool.  Anyway, if you're looking for new games to play competitively I can recommend Prismata, it's very smartly done. I'm also checking out David Sirlin's ""Codex"" which also looks excellent."

The last few buy-it-nows that sold are usually a pretty accurate pricing. Auction-style listings tend to sell for very slightly less than value on average, but with some variance, and completed listings that did not sell are good for letting you know what price is too high. If you see anything anomalous (lower price than the rest), check to see that the seller is in the USA, as shipping costs might be keeping buyers from paying full value."

So regionals began and a lot of people didn't even have core sets to participate, it was dreadful. I've already pre-ordered 3x AGoT 2.0 Cores in anticipation of it selling out for a good portion of time. Part of the reason for the rotation is to cull the time it takes to get packs back into circulation. When you're printing 6 different LCGs (good thing they killed Warhammer: Invasion), 3 minis games, plus their other board games like their Descent line, I can't imagine how busy their printers are."

Netrunner,3da0vk,Schelome,3,Wed Jul 15 01:13:44 2015 UTC,"I have been thoroughly enjoying this series! Thanks for taking the time and effort to write and produce these ""little"" essays.  I'm REALLY hoping you are considering doing the same thing for each cycle, focusing on each faction as a whole rather than each data-pack... whatever you end up doing, these have been splendid so far.  And yeah, for the record, I agree with your critique of the core-set anarch icebreakers/data-sucker influence costs. Do you think it would make sense for FFG to release a ""2nd Edition"" of the core set with some minor balancing and tweaking (such as your suggestion regarding Gabe's ability in this video, which I also agree broadcasts too much to the Corp)?"
Netrunner,3da0vk,voodoochile78,2,Tue Jul 14 19:31:42 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the kind words!  I don't know if I do something like this for the cycles, but it's not out of the question.  Thanks for the suggestion! I'll definitely do another year-end retrospective at the end of 2015 if nothing else.  Not only do I think it makes sense for FFG to do a ""Core Set 2.0,"" but it's hypothetically supported by their rotation policy.  There's a caveat about ""the most recent version"" of the Core Set and Big Boxes.  In other words, were they to release Core Set 2.0, there is already a framework in place to govern updated versions of existing cards. My understanding is that this has already been done to a minor extent in the Game of Thrones LCG where a very small number of cards received reissued versions for game balance purposes. Maybe someone who knows more about that can chime in?  That said, I don't think we can expect sweeping changes to the Core Set. I highly doubt, for example, my ""better"" Gabe would be printed to replace the old one.  Even if every designer and player could agree that my version is better (which I highly suspect they could not), Gabe doesn't cause enough problems to warrant a fix.  I'd imagine that they'd want to keep the updated versions of cards to an extremely low number so as to keep as much of the original Core Set intact as possible.  I'm a huge supporter of the Core Set 2.0 idea, but we should hope for 2-3 fixed cards (Datasucker + Astroscript?), not a bunch of minor changes even though those might be good for the game.   It's with this perspective that I've supported banning Datasucker.  It's not that I don't think that a fixed version of the card could be printed; much to the contrary, I've seen a lot of good suggestions by the community that would address the core problems with the card.  But it could be a very long time before we see a Core Set 2.0, and realistically that's the only shot we have at getting Datasucker fixed.  I'd rather see action taken much sooner to deal with the Anarch breaker suite, and I see banning Datasucker as the simplest solution.  Sure, it'd be nice if we could get a Core Set 2.0 with influence-adjusted Mimic, Yog.0, Datasucker, Parasite and Corroder, but I highly doubt FFG would be willing to retool a huge block of cards.  It's much simpler to implement the banning of Datasucker, and while that doesn't fix all of the problems, it goes a long way."

Netrunner,3d983a,BoomFrog,2,Tue Jul 14 15:35:17 2015 UTC,"Valencia blackmail with datasucker/parasite and real breakers & 3x clone chip seems to be doing okay for me. I've been able to always do at least one of the following (in order of risk/difficulty):   1) Run regularly when corp is at 8 credits or less with no Golds rezzed protecting an upgrade where I'm running at  2) Blackmail servers with Batty and no rezzed Gold (it doesn't matter much if there's an ETR ice rezzed, it's a waste of a good Batty compared to the golden blowout)  3) Run other servers than rezzed Gold + upgrade  4) Lose psi game only with no other nexts rezzed (and have a clone chip ready to break the Gold after Batty destroys 4tman or Mimic/datasucker). Use blackmail to guarantee no surprise ice rezzes if necessary  5) When all else fails, you still have a 1/3 chance to win the psi game vs Batty  I guess you could also Vamp if there's no upgrade on HQ, but almost everything works better with that card so it goes without saying. :P  Batty takes a lot of setting up to work well, especially the Golden version. You should also hear warning bells a mile away (immediately when you see a single next ice). I'm more worried to face Batty as a surprise in NEH. A first turn remote of Batty + Cortex lock is scary as fuck, you don't expect the corp can (semi-reliably) kill you with just 4c.

Maybe ICE trashing, but that's a lot of ICE trashing (basically, don't let them have more than 5 NEXT ICE up, and have enough recursion to get all your programs back).    FAO will tell you if the unrezzed ICE really is NEXT Gold.  Escher will let you move that unrezzed ICE to a less threatening server, and let you stack things of the same type for Shaper breakers.    Snitch is worth considering, since you can jack out before they can use Batty, even if rezzed.  Indexing or Woman in the Red Dress/Bug can let you know when they've drawn into Batty.    There are counters, but I still think a card that practically ignores the entire game state and can decide the game is a mistake on FFG's part.  You have to plan way too much around this one card."

Netrunner,3d983a,DarthPositus,2,Wed Jul 15 18:43:18 2015 UTC,"Nasir Faust and Argus flatline.  The Argus deck just wins. I have no idea why, but the deck has done really well in all of my casual game nights. People go for multiaccess though it kills you just like in PE: You either overflood with tags, or take damage.   The Nasir is a new build, but wanted to try it out. It started as an Exile deck, but then I deemed Nasir the better ID. I need to test if 2x E3 or 2x Parasite is better (running 1x copy of the other card). But the deck seems promising and DOESN'T rely on Workshop. The deck only uses Clone Chip and SMC as credit dumps. Have to see if I want to use something else possibly (would try Savior, but no influ...). Also not sure on the QT + Game Day split yet. As of now it's 2x QT + 1x Game Day, might swap it around though."

A surprisingly brutal Nisei Division deck that's won most of its matchups. A pretty terrible NBN tagstorm deck that uses jank like pairing Bandwidth and Crisium Grid.   Runner:   Though I might experiment with other runners, my heart will always lie with my first love, Exile, and his wonderful jank (Faerie recursion and Test Run-Scavenge) This really unconventional Valencia deck that I'm actually quite proud of. It uses Stim Dealer, Joshua B., and Amped Up to gain a ton of extra clicks, then gets the Corp broke with Account Siphon and Vamp. Then, when they can't do anything, start milling tons of cards per turn with your Data Leak Reversal, which you protect with 3x Fall Guys. It's really brutal, and has become sort of the new hotness amongst our local players. A stupid but fun Caissa deck that uses Clone Chip and Street Peddler for instant access to the chess pieces and Off-Campus Apartment for draw. A really efficient Andy connections deck that makes a ton of money thanks to Tri-Maf Contacts, Kati, and Underworld Contacts. Rachel Beckman doesn't hurt either."

The Geist isn't anything super special. 3x Faerie, Clone Chip, Forger, Crescentus, Siphon, etc. It needs more Legworks, Inside Jobs and multi-access. I ran out of room and INF, but SOT is so, so good with Geist that I'd love to give it a few more triggers.  Argus Midseasons is fun, I've been thinking about it for a while. It runs SE, Traffic Accident + Midseasons for the kill combo, Oaktown Renovation to force runs to trigger tags, and Checkpoint as a very cheap early piece of ICE (it rules over Melange).

Netrunner,3d983a,TonyStellato,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:55:12 2015 UTC,Mimic is awesome but in my local strength 3 sentries are fairly rare. Certainly too rare for me to spend the MU and card slot on Mimic.  And to get past say two strength 4 sentries Ninja and Pipeline pay the same amount. Two sentries on a single central server is very common and three isn't unusual.  Pipeline is 1 credit more than Ninja to get past the rare strength 3 sentry that I occasionally see.

Because the amount of cards is so huge and I don't know too many of them, I've just straight-up stolen one deck per side and played them on Jinteki the last couple of days. I finally won a game with each late yesterday, which I'm super stoked about because it means that at least my decision making is getting better.  For Corp, I'm using the NEH Fastrobiotics (I love the story/flavor of NBN) deck that won French Nationals 2015) (link). Astroscript seems way too broken sometimes.

On the corp side I'm happy with my Jinteki Biotech deck (without giving too much away let's just say it's a hybrid) but I have no idea what my runner is doing. Stealth Hayley was great against RP but it seems like no-one's running RP any more round here. I tried a Valencia deck tonight and it was ok but I wasn't really feeling it. It might even be time for my notorious Iain Overmind deck to ride again.
Netrunner,3d983a,Angedelo,1 point,Tue Jul 14 23:48:06 2015 UTC,"Corp is a HB:ETF with Mandatory Upgrades and an all-operator economy that's been working really well for me. NRDB link. Once it's out I'd like to try a butchershop build using Harpsichord Studios and Explode-a-Plaooza.  I keep on changing runner, it's the one I'm less sure of. Once the cycle is finished I'm going to try a Leela deck, but right now I'm trying to get Nasir to work with a Whizzard backup plan."
Netrunner,3d9bvc,nelsormensch,15,Tue Jul 14 14:47:48 2015 UTC,"Pros: Wonderful in geist and possibly Iain as well. It allows cloud breakers to be viable and turns on underworld contacts so you can get that drip econ rolling. It triggers geists ability and also helps to deal with weak traces, cadeceus now costs 1 to beat its first trace which is good. It also works handily to avoid sea source scorch plays. It also super cheap for a console.   Cons: it's not Desperado."
Netrunner,3d9bvc,vicvonshroom,7,Tue Jul 14 15:02:40 2015 UTC,"Every deck has that con, with one exception."
Netrunner,3d9bvc,ArgusTheCat,5,Tue Jul 14 17:55:54 2015 UTC,"I like the fact it removes a tag as a paid ability. That's a first in Tag removal and can be exploited with cards like Data Leak Reversal for instance... Another is if you Vamp your opponent to 0 cr with resources on the field, you can carry the tag until he/she gets 2 credits and bam Forge your way out from getting a resource trashed."
Netrunner,3d9bvc,reversezer0,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:31:38 2015 UTC,Also lets you combo with Activist Support. Not sure if Blackmail / BP is viable in Geist?
Netrunner,3d9bvc,Kandiru,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:14:59 2015 UTC,Activist Support's tag can still be avoided with other methods as the tag happens corp turn and the bad pub happens runner turn. I'm highlighting the fact that you remove the tag via paid ability.  And Blackmail/BP could be viable in Geist. Criminal Blackmail decks are around. Used one in Iain Sterling with Logos and some connections a long while back. Muertos Gang Member can help keep Blackmail decks a touch more viable.
Netrunner,3d9bvc,reversezer0,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:50:08 2015 UTC,"You can drop the activist support when the corp is low (0-1) on credits, and then remove the tag only if they click/Beanstalk Royalty up to 2C though. Which is slightly more flexible than using Decoy / City Hall.  HQ Interface, Gang Sign, Raymond Black and BadPub creates a lot of HQ pressure on the poor Corp."
Netrunner,3d9bvc,Kandiru,4,Tue Jul 14 17:01:15 2015 UTC,"If this wasn't a console, it would be awesome and I'd use it a lot.  Because this is a console, I don't think it's going to see much play. It's competing with Desperado and Box-E in faction. It's ability is good, but not ""console good."" Link is good, but there are already great sources of link (Globsec is just as cheap, Dyson provides a memory, etc).   Maybe if it had one more thing, like a single recurring credit for something like events. Thematically, at least, it is similar to a prepaid voicepad in the sense that it's a cheap electronic you pick up at Radio Shack, use until they trace your number, and then throw into a dumpster."
Netrunner,3d9bvc,JohnQK,4,Tue Jul 14 15:39:26 2015 UTC,"If it was not a console, it would be power creep. Decoy exists, from the core set"
Netrunner,3d9bvc,TonyStellato,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:19:59 2015 UTC,"But they have said power creep would occur when a card isn't functioning as it was intended. Like Cortex Lock vs. Neural Katana. not directly power creep, but Mimic invalidates Katana and not Cortex Lock. Since no one runs Decoy, maybe it's because it's an underpowered card and needs to be brought up to the level of the rest of the cards."
Netrunner,3d9bvc,BlueSapphyre,6,Tue Jul 14 18:24:03 2015 UTC,"Cortex Lock and Neural Katana work very differently. I run both in PE. Also, cards like Batty actually make Katana a lot better, which is my preferred method of dealing with underpowered cards. Decoy is fine as it is. In a meta with a lot more Sea-Scorched, it's pretty good actually. Late-spin had both Scorched Imaging and Supermodernism, and I was happy including a 1x tutorable decoy in my deck."
Netrunner,3d9bvc,TonyStellato,2,Tue Jul 14 18:50:24 2015 UTC,"I understand they're different, but the design behind Cortex Lock was because the runner dropping Mimic and running invalidated the Katana while CL still punishes that small of a rig."
Netrunner,3d9bvc,BlueSapphyre,2,Tue Jul 14 18:54:43 2015 UTC,"Yes, but you have to understand that at any given moment not every card will see play in the meta. The design is middle ha rock paper scissors design, which means that some cards will only be good when others are or aren't. Pre-NEH and architect, not EVERY deck had Mimic, and I specifically remember katana being a random splash in NBN because it punished face checking. Cortex Lock would be a lot worse in that Katman meta that won all the regionals last year.   Edit: with that said, architect is so incredibly strong (way too much so) that Mimic is likely the go-to sentry for a LOOONG time"
Netrunner,3d9bvc,TonyStellato,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:11:42 2015 UTC,"I actually think this may intentionally be the first console which is intended to be replaced. I can see some mileage in running 2 or 3x forger, 2x desperado and some other link card, if you're using cloud and/or your econ is underworld contacts dependent for instance. Main reason being it helps you land an early siphon or 2."
Netrunner,3d9bvc,MakersEye,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:53:59 2015 UTC,"In my Geist deck there's no console I'd rather have. I started out with Desperado but Forger is just a much better fit. It's definitely niche I'll give you that but I think that's typical of most consoles. Some are very good all-rounders that you can slot into a lot of decks (Astrolabe and Desperado being the two main ones) but others only really fit within a certain type of deck. Grimoire for decks with a lot of viruses, Deep Red for Caissa (or decks that exploit having a high MU), Toolbox for big rig, Blackguard for Silhouette, etc. That said I think the best place for Forger right now is Geist. Other decks that want a really cheap way of getting an extra link (that isn't Globalsec) might want it. But I think it has the most utility in Geist currently."
Netrunner,3d9bvc,Rejusu,1 point,Tue Jul 14 22:39:59 2015 UTC,It certainly does work well with Geist in that his ID effectively gives it that second ability it needs. It's sort of like a little Lawyer Up in that way.
Netrunner,3d9bvc,JohnQK,2,Tue Jul 14 23:24:53 2015 UTC,"Were you considering a cloud giest build?  Were you running access to globalsec and no console?  Then you are the target market for forger.  Criminals often get away with a 3-4 Mu build so don't need the Mu most consoles provide, so if you need link badly, this could answer the call."
Netrunner,3d9bvc,RestarttGaming,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:14:12 2015 UTC,"Can confirm. I typically only ever use my memory for Grappling hooks, Crecentus, and one or two real breakers like Corroder and Rex. Maybe a sneakdoor if I'm feeling spicy (although I feel like just cutting that as I almost never play it). Everything else lives in the Forger cloud."
Netrunner,3d9bvc,Rejusu,2,Tue Jul 14 22:41:55 2015 UTC,Forger isn't unique...

Netrunner,3d9bvc,ChainnChomp,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:00:03 2015 UTC,It isn't. Does that mean you can have more than one out? I thought that limit of 1 console per player meant you could only have one out. Please say I'm wrong in thinking that.
Netrunner,3d9bvc,DarthPositus,7,Tue Jul 14 15:09:37 2015 UTC,"Correct. It isn't ""unique"" but it is still a console and you can still only have one out at a time."
Netrunner,3d9bvc,TonyStellato,2,Tue Jul 14 15:10:49 2015 UTC,"While Forger is almost always a guaranteed include in a Geist deck, I've been making great use of it in my Andy Off-Campus connections deck.

It's a neat console that is unfortunately a little linear, though it does enable better Underworld Contacts plays across the faction. It's ability to provide a Decoy effect can be quite good against SEA Source, which is still a thing."

Its fine to include the cards anecdotally but you should still focus on agendas. Just my 2$ there are some much more experienced players around here than i.
Netrunner,3d93j0,soundships,10,Tue Jul 14 13:39:00 2015 UTC,"Shapers don't want to mill the Corp. They just want everything in R&D so they can access it. Not just Record Reconstructor, but also Analog Dreamers now put cards back in. Anarchs want stuff in Archives, and Criminals want stuff in HQ, hence Noise and Fisk.  So instead how about a reverse Fisk with something like 'The first time you make a successful run on R&D each turn, the Corp shuffles one random card from HQ into R&D'."

And it'll have to have a tag line using the phrase ""shake things up.""  This gives you a fresh peek at R&D if you don't like what you see, but it shouldn't be too OP since it would require making two solid runs to really get your money's worth. It's not exactly milling, but it's frustrating.  Maybe make it require having made a successful run on R&D previously or something."

Netrunner,3d7yzo,NikRichards,3,Tue Jul 14 15:52:18 2015 UTC,I plan on trying to run 3 of these in a noise Faust/Mill deck.  I think anything that gets me more cards and whittles down R&D quicker is gold for that kind of deck.
Netrunner,3d7yzo,sigma83,10,Tue Jul 14 09:23:37 2015 UTC,"I agree that Fisk Investment Seminar is exciting, but for a slightly different reason.  HQ access is not as reliable as R&D access, because of the random nature of the access. While I agree that the card will help pressure R&D, I think this is not it's best application.  Note Fisk's ability: The first time you make a successful run on a central server each turn, you may force the corp to draw 1 card.  This means that if you play Fisk Investment Seminar and make a central server run, the corp will have had to draw FIVE cards by the time their turn starts: 3 from Seminar, 1 from Fisk's ability, 1 from their mandatory draw. This is a significant portion of their deck.  Therefore, it is more likely that agendas will pile up in HQ, possibly one of the worst places for agendas that the corp is not ready to score. These agendas are going to have to go somewhere - either archives, onto the board, or they stay in HQ - where AFTER they discard down to their handsize, a Legwork will have a higher chance of success.  Compound this with something like Woman in the Red Dress, and HQ bloat becomes a serious problem for the corp that Fisk can easily take advantage of.  HQ bloat is also a great way of clearing a stagnant R&D. Let us say Fisk has just Maker's Eyed R&D and seen nothing. Fisk Investment Seminar on the next turn will flush R&D and give him a fresh card on top.  Again, the combo with Woman In the Red Dress is apparent. The corp reveals a non-agenda card on the top of R&D at the start of your turn. You then play Fisk Investment Seminar to flush the non-agenda into HQ and see a new card. Of course, you can do this to a lesser degree with his ability - run archives, get security testing, draw the non-ice card.  With all these pressures combined it can be extremely difficult for the corp to manage the sheer flood of cards coming through HQ. Legworks: Away!"
Netrunner,3d7yzo,sigma83,3,Tue Jul 14 06:34:46 2015 UTC,"I agree that if you're playing Fisk you certainly want this. What I'm not certain about is whether or not you want to be playing Fisk at all - it's quite possible he'll be very strong, but I want to wait and see before I make up my mind. He's a hard one to theorycraft.  But I think this has application in any criminal build, really. My thinking is that between HQI, Legwork and FIS you can get away without any (or without much) R&D threat, leaving more influence to spend on things like, say, less shitty breakers. You can even ditch the old run-based economy altogether, and use Sneakdoor Beta to pressure archives, and pick a more interesting console."

Netrunner,3d7yzo,Quarg,-2,Tue Jul 14 06:58:04 2015 UTC,"Daily Business Show's biggest drawback is that it helps R&D lock the corp. By removing 2 cards from the top of R&D every turn, you're letting the runner see fresh cards every time if they have an interface or 2.   As it pertains to the Fisk Investment Seminar and HQ bloat, yes it will definitely help, but I can see moments where you'd probably want to switch it off."
Netrunner,3d7yzo,sigma83,11,Tue Jul 14 07:06:56 2015 UTC,"It seems you don't understand what R&D lock is.  R&D lock isn't about seeing new cards each turn, it's about the corp not seeing any cards that havn't been accessed (and therefore not seeing any agendas to score). In that sense DBS can only help prevent R&D lock as the corp is able to see an additional card each turn (thus the runner needs to dig deeper to achieve R&D lock)."
Netrunner,3d7yzo,Quarg,-1,Tue Jul 14 11:31:22 2015 UTC,"If you're not ready to score agendas, you don't want to see agendas. Daily Business Show helps with this but ironically it takes two cards off the top of R&D every time.  If a runner is digging R&D for 2 cards every turn, you're essentially letting them see two fresh cards by letting your DBS stay up, thus giving them better lock. I've seen game states where the corp trashed their DBS in order to slow down the flow of cards from R&D to keep the runner from seeing more unique accesses."
Netrunner,3d7yzo,sigma83,13,Tue Jul 14 11:48:49 2015 UTC,"You arn't wrong about it allowing the runner to see more cards, but that's not what R&D lock means."

Netrunner,3d7yzo,Kandiru,1 point,Wed Jul 15 05:14:58 2015 UTC,"In the same vein of logic, Deep Thought might also be good on Fisk as well, if you can get counters onto it (which is the hard part, I guess). An agenda on top triggered WITRD generally means that the corporation is going to put/leave the agenda in the most heavily defended of either HQ or R&D, to protect it. However in the case of an agenda detected by Deep Thought, the corp has no control. If R&D is less iced than HQ, just run on R&D to snag the agenda. If HQ is less iced than R&D, you can trigger Fisk's passive off Archives or HQ (or use Fisk Investment Seminar) and then run HQ to try to pick it up. I think HQ interface will be mandatory on Fisk for these sorts of WITRD/Deep Thought builds.  Now if we're talking influence, WITRD is 4 and can be Hostaged, whereas Deep Thought is 2 but you'd probably want to run two copies. I'd say it's about even on that front."
Netrunner,3d7yzo,pbrand,3,Tue Jul 14 11:27:10 2015 UTC,Remember than Fisk's Ability fires before you access. So you can just run HQ and make them draw the card before you access.

Netrunner,3d7yzo,AnalysisSitus,1 point,Tue Jul 14 13:43:57 2015 UTC,"This means that if you play Fisk Investment Seminar and make a central server run, the corp will have had to draw FIVE cards by the time their turn starts: 3 from Seminar, 1 from Fisk's ability, 1 from their mandatory draw. This is a significant portion of their deck.   While this will force agendas into HQ, it's also going to feed the Corp econ, ice and whatever other cards they needed to start scoring those agendas. If the Corp has decent amounts of money, I fear that playing FIS is going to end with lead to ""Hedge Fund, install upgrade, install ice"" more often than ""oh no now my HQ has 4 agendas"". Against poor Corps it's probably better, but you're also feeding them the cards they needed to get rich.  So I'm really not sure how good FIS will be. I want to like it, but currently I suspect the biggest beneficiary will be Leela. FIS seems at its strongest when the Corp can't afford to spend their next turn just playing the stuff you give them. Against a Corp who just IA-ed something, playing FIS as Leela and spending your turn setting up econ seems amaing."

That's my problem with Fisk - just because you ran on a central server doesn't necessarily mean you're in a position to take advantage of the corp's draw, meaning you might risk actually helping them along.  It'll also be amazing in any deck that aims to get a solid siphon lock - when the corp has no money it really can't afford to deal with an influx of new cards."

But that's the thing, though - if I pour a bunch of cards into the HQ of a poor Corp, I'm feeding them agendas, sure, but also taxing ice they can slap on HQ and econ cards. You give HB their Adonis Campaigns and Breaker Bay Grids, NBN gets Sweeps Week, and RP gets Sundew, MHC and Celebrity Gift. I'm not sure FIS is a net positive for you in this situation.

You are so completely right about how the current judge situation is overly strict and ruins the experience for so many players. But you're so complete missing why we need a judge program.  Judging isn't -- or at least shouldn't -- be about being the terrifying spectre who drops the DQ-hammer at the slightest infraction. It's about recognizing that mistakes are inevitable, and doing what we can to resolve these mistakes in a fair, but above all consistent and impartial way. We don't need to DQ, or even game-loss people for that.   The current situation comes about because judges don't have any written policy to reference. Magic went through this phase too, back in the pre-IPG days. They're afraid of being seen as soft, or playing favourites, and if they're challenged on their rulings, they don't know how to defend themselves. Without any training or standards, they often feel like they need to come down hard. But with a written policy, it's simple; any accusations of bias or leniency can be deflected onto the written policy. It gives judges the confidence to issue fair and reasonable decisions, and could reign in the current fun-police attitude that far too many self-appointed judges have adopted.   Are you familiar with the Magic IPG (for competitive tournaments) or the JAR (for little events, like Friday Night Magic)? It's much kinder and gentler than you seem to think. And an explicit goal of Magic policy, for a very long time, has been to provide rules that aren't abusable by tricky rules lawyering or angle shooting. If the Magic community is unwelcoming, it's because money as prizes pushes people to win at all costs... not because it has standards for handling errors.   Magic learned long ago that DQ's shouldn't be issued for accidents. That just ruins the experience for everyone involved. It sucks any fun out of the whole thing. No, in Magic, even at the highest levels, DQ's are only awarded for things like deliberate cheating, theft, harassment, or violence. We don't issue game losses except for really serious mistakes, where the opponent had no chance to verify the play was legal, or for players repeatedly making the same error after receiving warnings.   Coming from a Magic background, it seems absolutely fucking insane that I can go to a Netrunner tournament where the top prize is a twenty dollar playmat and have mistakes punished more harshly than they would be a the top tables of a Grand Prix with literally thousands of dollars on the line."
Netrunner,3d67r8,RS14-2,8,Tue Jul 14 06:53:32 2015 UTC,"No! This is all new to me. Thanks so much for laying it out.  My entire knowledge of the judge program comes from Netrunner not having these ""terrifying spectres"" a year ago, we have them now, and we only seem to be having one half of the disccusion about them.  The talk I hear about why we need judges is always ""so we know what happens when someone makes a mistake"". I don't see people talking about the emotional impact of a judging program in a game that's able to recruit new players for no reason other than because it's fun. Judges need to feel like a friendly service, and not an oppressor.  I knew I was out of my depth discussing this on Run Last Click. But I guess I was willing to look like an idiot to see if I could start a discussion.  Amazing to hear that Magic went through the same ""fun police"" period! I guess for me, players sorting out rules errors themselves always seemed like a far quicker, easier solution than a gigantic Infraction Procedure Guide. But I know I'm in the minority on that."
Netrunner,3d67r8,mrquinns,10,Tue Jul 14 08:30:08 2015 UTC,"My background is a competitive Magic Judge. I've been to GPs, I've been to conferences where more experienced judges give seminars on specific topics...  Judges provide Customer Service primarily. Judges have nothing to do without players, so ultimately, we're here for the players. Players should never feel afraid to call a judge! (Seriously, call on us for anything!) We aren't scary boogeymen out to ruin your fun. :)  Next, the purpose of Judges is to arbitrate disputes. If something weird or wonky happens in a game, but both players agree on what should happen, you can just keep on playing! First, because if you're both pretty happy about the result, then you're having fun, which means Job Accomplished. Second, Judges should only get involved if they see a game rule being actively broken, or if called over. They shouldn't get involved because they feel like it. Finally, because trying to enforce 'you should always call a judge' is laughable at best. If two players DISAGREE on the outcome of an event, that's the Primary Task that judges are equipped to handle! Call one over and see what should happen. They're a neutral party!  The IPG and JAR combine to delineate 'Serious Times' and 'Fun Times' tournament types. The IPG specifically is for Competitive, where competition requires that the same remedies be used across the board, in every store, in every tournament. There's a section on cheating in both documents, but for the vast majority of each, the guide is assuming that no cheating is occuring. They cover what to do when something doesn't go according to the rules. They aren't about Punishing infractions. They're about 'This went wrong. Now what?'  The IPG differs from the JAR; the JAR will try to fix any problems that arise. The IPG, at competitive events, will not usually try to 'fix' things. Judges are told, repeatedly, that Fixing the Board State is NOT your job at Competitive events. The board state is already wrong, and anything done to it further is still wrong. The IPG prescribes specific remedies to specific situations, which are deemed to be as fair as possible with the intent of getting players back to playing their game.  We need guidelines in Netrunner so that the competitive experience is consistent. We need guidelines so judges know what to do in specific situations. We need guidelines for judges to point to and say 'You've broken the rules, this is the consequence.' We need guidelines so that judges are not forced to take things case-by-case, delivering varying 'fixes' and penalties.  I'm relatively passionate about this topic because it's relevant to my interests, and I feel this is the one hole in competitive Netrunner at this time."
Netrunner,3d67r8,Gmrxtrme,5,Tue Jul 14 13:12:10 2015 UTC,"Wow! That fills me with confidence, especially the part about players seeing if they can solve the dispute themselves first. Thanks for taking the time to explain all this to me. I feel much better."
Netrunner,3d67r8,mrquinns,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:37:02 2015 UTC,"The fun policing is done as much by the players as it is done by rules and judges. There's people I've encountered in both Netrunner and Magic that I'll avoid playing purely because of their attitude. There was way more people like that in Magic than there is in Netrunner and I've played Netrunner far, far more.  I suspect the problem may stem from the most serious players being the ones who go on the judge program. It's not a massive assumption to think that as they're more serious about the game they'll be less likely to be friendly about stuff. The best judges I've had in Magic have been the shop owners who have the event's success as a priority over applying the rules with an iron fist.  I totally get your concerns, and really enjoyed listening to Chris, Eady and yourself talk about it (it's not their usual thing but there gold in there when you poke them about more serious subjects). I do think however that FFG will get it right enough and the player base will self police enough to hit a happy balance. Hopefully above all else they'll have similar tiers to Magic so that it's only the most serious players who'll have to deal with the strictest rules."

Netrunner,3d67r8,DeebsterUK,2,Wed Jul 15 09:27:28 2015 UTC,"Very well point.  In the very least, we need a Judge Program or IPG so the three 'tiers' of play that FFG push actually have some gravity to them.  As it stands, all the tiers feel identical.  Not only that, but without any PIG or Judge Porgram, there is no consistency across events from store to store, region to region, which can also mess with people's play expreinces.  Getting a game loss for something you saw someone received a warning for at another store during the same level of event feels gross.  We spoke to Quinn's about this when he was on The Winning Agenda."

I will say in my time as a Netrunner judge I've only ever seen one player come close to a DQ for inappropriate behaviour and they were let off with a warning, that was at UK Nationals this year. I don't know where all these DQs are going on but it's a little disappointing to hear they're happening so frequently.    Just wondering if people are using the term DQ and game loss interchangeably?  Game losses are far more common for rules/game infractions in my experience and sometimes it doesn't feel like the right thing to do just because I don't take any pleasure in telling someone they efforts are now void. It sucks, but until we have clearer guidelines that aren't essentially lifted and adapted from MTG but tailored to Netrunner.    Which seems to be quite common, I have the MTG guidelines on my PC as reference to see what the biggest card game thinks is appropriate for rules infractions - It's commonly warnings and game losses - DQs are more reserved for when you're cheating intentionally or being a total pencil - Which is fully in line with what you've said and I think that is the appropriate level.    I guess I'm lucky that the person who helped me learn to judge has a history with MTG and the rules for judging therein.    I might have a little more to add later on :)"

Also, as to the judges program, my background in gaming is a bit different, coming not from cards, but from miniatures gaming (Warmachine/Hordes) where we have official judges. Depending on how they handled, they actually help the game go more smoothly and be more enjoyable for the players. If any issues do come up, they are like the ""agent"" - the judge deals with any potential ugliness and lets the players continue to just enjoy the game.    Granted, in miniatures games the judges are used more often because it is less precise because of the placement of models, charge lanes, etc. but in that regard, they really do actually help the game be much more enjoyable and take any ""rules issues"" out of it and just let the players focus on their strategies and the game between each other."

Your Ice aren't terrible for what's available, but they are a bit expensive considering your only income for most of the game is going to be hoping they don't snipe your adonis/pads.  Experiential Data is kind of a bad card with Bioroids because they can just click through if they ever get too expensive to break, then trash your stacked Datas. I think most people would agree Corporate Troubleshooter is about as effective with less risk, cost and setup on your part.

They use to be called InkedPlaymats as well, if you've heard of them.  Anyone can take a high rez image and turn it into a playmat or set of card sleeves with inked gaming, you just crop it to the right size and they make it pretty easy (or you can pay them to adjust it if you'd rather).

Netrunner,3d6hw5,JediCheese,2,Mon Jul 13 23:50:42 2015 UTC,"I appreciate the recommendations, thanks.  And I did read a bit I the buying guide, though not after I selected a few packs I was interested in.   But I'm mostly looking for something more focused. My budget is around ~60 to 70 bucks, so I was hoping for specific recommendations for first 4 ish packs.  That's the problem with starting to play a game like this, paying for all the cards. Still, almost certainly cheaper than other gaming habits."
Netrunner,3d6hw5,JediCheese,3,Tue Jul 14 00:05:50 2015 UTC,"The problem with suggesting which Netrunner data packs to purchase is that it varies.  It varies based on how much you want to spend and what you want to play.  I found two competitive decks that I wanted to play, found decklists for them, and purchased the required stuff.  If you have a Core Set, True Colors, First Contact, Cyber Exodus, and Order and Chaos, you could build the following decks: http://netrunnerdb.com/en/decklists/find?faction=&author=&title=&sort=popularity&packs%5B%5D=1&packs%5B%5D=28&packs%5B%5D=4&packs%5B%5D=12&packs%5B%5D=24    I'm new to Noise, but I will say that for him at least 2 core sets is nearly required.  Your money in the deck is Grimoire + Cyberfeeder + Aesop's Pawnshop + Cache.  You turn a card and a recurring credit into 7 hard credits.  I've been getting away with 2x core sets until recently and had 2 copies of Aesop's.  The draw situation is Wyldside and Adjusted Chronotype, of which Wyldside is a 2x of in the core set.  Finally to get into servers you need Datasucker + Parasite, and Datasucker is a 2x of in the core set.  Déjà Vu gets you all the core parts of the deck back to be reused and is a 2x of in the core set.  IMHO, to really play Noise you really want 2x Core, The Spaces Between, and The Valley.  The problem is that's nearly your budget if you pay retail.    When it comes to Engineering the Future, it's much the same but with different sets (from my experience for what it's worth, I'm still new at this).  You 100% want NAPD Contract and Ash (Double Time and What Lies Ahead).  Pad, Adonis, and Eve Campaigns are your drip econ but you'll have to get Humanity's Shadow to get the Eve Campaign.  I have found that Encryption Protocol prevents the opponents from trashing your econ but it's from another set (Trace Amount).  So here you are looking at Core, Double Time, What Lies Ahead, Humanity's Shadow, and Trace Amount for your additions.  Again, within your budget (at retail) but only if that's the only deck you build."
Netrunner,3d6hw5,JediCheese,1 point,Tue Jul 14 02:04:49 2015 UTC,"Thank you, that was a very good write up. I really appreciate you telling me which packs things were in, as well.   I'll look into those, and talk to my friend, but I only ever play runner, and my friend only ever really plays corp, so if I'm buying packs I'll focus on getting the cards I want for my runner deck(s).   On an unrelated note, do you remember which set cards are in, or did you check for some of those?"
Netrunner,3d6hw5,Dapperghast,2,Tue Jul 14 03:04:24 2015 UTC,"I checked for nearly all of them.  Only reason I know as much as I do about the core set is I spent last night weeding out my extra cards over 3x of each from the core set.  The tournament decklists I netdecked from above have the sets that each of the cards came from.  I will admit these recommendations are from my newb experiences.  Don't take my word as gospel, it's just my experiences.  Often time having an economy allows you to play subpar cards because you have the money to use them (vs efficient cards you can't use because there is no money)."

Survivors said three guys in a car drove around The Root shooting at it until it finally collapsed.   This card is great for popping those expensive things that you know you're going to have to deal with, like SanSan or even a Crisium. I don't see it getting used too much with Caprice or Ash because, when those go into a server, everyone knows what they are and so they are safe to rez right away.   It's those SanSans, where you don't want to dump 6 credits until you're ready to score something out, where this card really shines."

Netrunner,3d4z8q,sigma83,17,Mon Jul 13 22:19:21 2015 UTC,"This + the gun is the most obvious synergy. It's fairly anti-glacier, since lightly protected or unprotected remotes don't really benefit from being Driven By.   The main upshot though is the continuation of one of Criminal's criminally underexplored strengths: information gathering. We see it in cards like Satellite Uplink, Executive Wiretaps, Expert Schedule Analyzer, Silhouette, Blackguard, Snitch, and my personal favorite : Bug. If you're running an Iain Stirling deck, stick 1x Bug in there. It's amazing.   Criminals have long labored under the difficulties of their underpowered breaker suite. This, imo, is due to the somewhat obvious fact that the designers want certain criminal archetypes to make precision runs - low frequency, high impact runs (where Aurora and Peacock suddenly don't become as horrible). My Iain deck runs all in faction breakers, as does my Leela. The influence is better spent elsewhere if you're not running your butt off every turn and choking the corp with perfect information and HQ bloat (a trend we see continued in the upcoming Laramy Fisk and his card support)   I'm not bashing the run everywhere archetype, but it's damn obvious to me that trying to force every criminal ID down that route is one of the main reasons people are becoming frustrated with the criminal card pool being 75% Genesis Cycle or earlier.   Maybe it's just my inner Shaper showing but IMO force is meaningless without precision. Cards like Drive By allow for greater precision - you don't even have to run! Why bust your credits making it down to the bottom of the glacier server when you can just spend a couple clicks and a sneakdoor to either blast the sysop in the face or have your gang pals take care of it.  Actually running the server feels almost crude by comparison, and if there's one thing I've always admired about the Criminals it's their sense of style and finesse."

Netrunner,3d4z8q,djc6535,5,Mon Jul 13 18:01:23 2015 UTC,I count only eight cards dedicated to support Desperado style run-everywhere   I'd argue that's because Desperado is so darn powerful that they've been effectively trying to design you away from it for some time now.  Similar to the notion that Crims have been given some of the best resources over the last few cycles in an attempt to design them away from Tag-me Siphon assault.    This is what you do with an LCG that has a dominant play style:  You don't give that play style new toys to work with.  Otherwise you're just doubling down on the current strong meta.  RP wasn't very strong until a number of cards with spectacular synergy hit the scene.  Now it's a powerhouse and you're seeing VERY limited support and a lot of hate.    This is good and as it should be.  Know what happens when you don't stop doubling down on the current strong play style?  NEH.
Netrunner,3d4z8q,neutronicus,6,Mon Jul 13 20:16:00 2015 UTC,"RP ... VERY limited support   Criiiiiiicckkkkkkk  Sorry, I spilled some salt."
Netrunner,3d4z8q,sigma83,2,Tue Jul 14 04:57:30 2015 UTC,I would agree with everything you said.
Netrunner,3d4z8q,Xenasis,2,Mon Jul 13 20:40:29 2015 UTC,"I disagree with most of the points you're making.   Similar to the notion that Crims have been given some of the best resources over the last few cycles   Have they? Symmetrical Visage, Earthrise Hotel are both Neutral. Those, Kati, and occasionally Same Old Thing are the only Resources you'll find in Criminal decks.    This is what you do with an LCG that has a dominant play style   Criminals haven't really been dominant for a long time. The only reason they were good last cycle was because they had the best matchup vs NEH, but Clot meant that Kate has that matchup now, too.  It's good to give people other options, but is there really any reason to completely snuff aggressive Criminal out? What about the people who like playing it?   Now it's a powerhouse and you're seeing VERY limited support and a lot of hate.   Really? What's Marcus Batty? Batty's the best Corp card in the pack, and one of the best (if not the best) of the Cycle so far.   a lot of hate.   Even if this were true, it's not a good way to design a game. The best way to design a game isn't to print cards that blank other strategies, it's to make more strategies viable. I'd rather have a few good strategies than a constantly changing ""best"" strategy.  I think it's important to release good cards all around. A lot of people complain about Criminal builds being stale and very much the same as one another. That's because FFG haven't printed many playable cards for them after the Genesis Cycle other than in H&P (where they got Sec Test and Passport)."

The problem here is that there aren't really any redeeming qualities about slow Criminal lists. That is, there aren't any reason to play it over Prepaid Kate. At least, if nothing else, aggressive Andy/Leela decks have HB matchups that are better than Kate.  The reason that almost every Criminal list you see is aggressive is because the other types of Criminals don't have any redeeming qualities and aren't at all tier one playable. It's not because people are scared to let go of their Desperados, it's because people like playing the best Runner decks in the format, and sadly, Criminal don't make it into that category at the moment (and only did last cycle because they were the best against NEH, something Clot stopped). They don't do anything better than Kate, and that's simply because the released cards haven't been on par. I was excited about The Supplier but nothing really followed it.   Criminals have long labored under the difficulties of their underpowered breaker suite. This, imo, is due to the somewhat obvious fact that the designers want certain criminal archetypes to make precision runs - low frequency, high impact runs   Great! I'd welcome some variation! The problem is really that the archetype isn't there yet. It's just a worse version of Prepaid Kate. You brought up Iain, who's a prime example of a Criminal card that should have been pushed a little harder than he was.  I'd welcome some playable Criminal cards, but Criminals don't have an even tier 2 list that isn't aggressive. Drive By's great because it's a Criminal card that might actually find its way into all types of Criminal decks. A card that's playable for Criminal that doesn't come from H&P, the Core Set, or Genesis is always welcome.   and if there's one thing I've always admired about the Criminals it's their sense of style and finesse.   It's kind of amusing to me that you're saying this about a card named ""Drive By""!  To summarise my reply, my points are as follows -   People aren't playing non-Desperado Criminal decks because there's no reason to, they aren't very good in comparison to the Desperado versions and don't do anything better than Prepaid Kate. There are a bunch of Criminal cards that are under-utilised. That's not because people are obsessed with Desperado or something, it's because there's no good-enough deck to put them in. Slower Criminal decks aren't some sort of hidden gem, they're just held back by Criminal's weak card pool. If FFG want them to be 'a thing', they can print some stronger cards for them. Actively printing good cards like Drive By is the best way to help Criminal's card pool along. We won't see any new archetypes flourish if we remain stuck with Criminal's soggy, outdated card pool."
Netrunner,3d4z8q,sigma83,4,Mon Jul 13 20:20:16 2015 UTC,I see your points. My experiments in Criminal haven't given me enough experience to argue against them. I can cite my own successes but that's anecdotal.

Netrunner,3d4z8q,ErikTwice,2,Tue Jul 14 07:08:07 2015 UTC,"It seems very odd for me to argue that there's no reason to play a slower criminal over Kate when they have completely different advantages and completely different matchups. For example, PPVP decks tend to struggle against decks based on asset spam, which Stirling does very well against.  Stirling right now is very well placed in the meta specially after the release of Drive By. It has a huge advantage against Blue Sun, is favoured against Jinteki RP and Genomics and thanks to Medium, Faerie and 3x Legwork it's also good against Butcher Shop. His weak spot -HB FA- is not very common and was forced to slowed down after the release of Clot so I think he's far better now than he was when I was taking him to tournaments.  Of course, I pack 3x Faerie, 3x Inside Job, 3x Legwork and spend influence on two copies of Medium, so I fear it's mainly a discussion of what we mean by ""aggressive"" or ""slow"" than by the actual workings of the identity! :)"
Netrunner,3d4z8q,ayylmao31,2,Mon Jul 13 22:46:04 2015 UTC,"+2 Drive-By, +1 S&W I think is the right ratio. Like Clot in a recursion starved deck (Noise, for example), you gotta slap it down at the right time and might get one good use out of it, but that's good enough for me.

I can think of a few possibilities.  1: Drive-By resolves entirely before Blackguard. By the time Blackguard would fire, there's nothing to rez.  2: Through cascading triggers, Blackguard forces the rez in-between Drive-By's effects. Then the corp must trash it.  3: Nobody plays Blackguard, you idiot. This doesn't matter.  1 seems most likely to be the official ruling, but #2 seems most consistent with the FAQ. #3 is clearly the correct answer."
Netrunner,3d4z8q,chrsjxn,5,Mon Jul 13 16:19:45 2015 UTC,"The sentences are separate, so you do them in order. Step 1: expose the installed card. That triggers the Blackguard rez. Step 2: Trash it if it's an asset or upgrade.  The second sentence doesn't care if the card is rezzed or unrezzed, only that it was exposed and is an asset/upgrade."
Netrunner,3d4z8q,hbarSquared,2,Mon Jul 13 16:31:28 2015 UTC,"Interesting.  So those two cards have a great synergy with Hacktivist Meeting, correct?  Drive-By exposes, Blackguard forces the rez, trashing a card from HQ with Hactivist, then Drive-By finishes the job by trashing the asset."
Netrunner,3d4z8q,chrsjxn,4,Mon Jul 13 17:28:10 2015 UTC,"Actually, no. You can never be forced to pay ""additional costs"" in netrunner. Eg, the runner isn't forced to pay 4 to steal NAPD if they can, counter to the rule that says you must steal an agenda when you access it. And the corp isn't forced to forfeit an agenda to rez an Archer if it's exposed with Blackguard on the table.  So in this case, Hacktivist Meeting works against your Blackguard + Drive-By combo by allowing the corp to decline to rez."

Don't play Crim if corps are building to deny run-based econ.  Denying run-based econ requires going slow, and Anarchs' powerful late game punishes corps who go slow, so play Anarch.  Eventually, corps will figure out that going fast is the way to punish the inconsistent Anarch early game, and the click compression of run-based econ and the early-game versatility of Inside Job will be good again."

In the few months I've been playing (in Australia) I haven't encountered a toxic or hateful person once. As someone coming from the fighting game community it makes me feel so much better about spending my weekends doing events where homophobic and rape remarks are thrown around.  I'm not sure a LGBT community is necessary as I've found even game store events to be safer spaces than most (speaking as a trans woman in a male dominated community). On an important note: if you want to make people feel comfortable and you hear someone using homophobic, sexist or transphobic slurs loudly nearby it would mean a lot to hear that language being called out. Also make sure your stores have unisex or womens bathrooms please.   I've only had positive experiences in NR and if you want more women to play just invite them :3"

I think there's a bit more room to explore why exactly the tournament is constructed the way it is, and whether alternatives have been experimented with elsewhere or in other games. Instead of playing 2 tournaments (Swiss and DE) is there some way to combine them into 1 and still have enough differentiation between players to have a satisfying outcome? If we must have the current structure is there a better way to award topping the Swiss vs coming 8th? Perhaps a different scoring mechanism, something like the match points system we already have in the rulebook? Are slower decks like RP inherently at a disadvantage because they risk draws to time, and is there any way to fix that? Etc."
Netrunner,3d4ck2,Kuhva,1 point,Tue Jul 14 03:22:19 2015 UTC,"I think there are a lot of changes that could be made to the current structure to smooth it out:   removing the DE portion altogether and drafting prizes based on swiss standings. keep DE portion,  but strengthen the advantage of higher swiss standings.  eg:  the higher standing always chooses corp or runner. remove DE portion, and have set prizes allocated to a points at the end of the event.  This would add some variability to the size of the prizepool for individual events,  but it would smooth out in the long run. keep DE portion, but have players play 1 game against eachother rather than 2 during the swiss.    with 2*log_2(|players|)^ - 1 rounds at 35 minutes each the event should be about the same length for less than 64 players and only a bit longer for more.  offer 0 points for going to time.   and theres a lot more that i cant really think of at the moment.  you can really make a tournament do what ever you want it to provided you dont ask too much of it.  just presume that players will always maximize the quality of the prize and go from there."

Netrunner,3d6252,RestarttGaming,2,Mon Jul 13 20:48:55 2015 UTC,"Ok!  First off there are three different kinds of pack  The core set the deluxe expansions the data packs    There's no card crossover in any of them - Cards that are in a data pack are ONLY in that datapack and not in other datapacks or in any deluxe expansion or in the core set.  The core set is the starting point.  It contains a bunch of cards for each faction and semi balanced decks.  You can pick up just that and play the game just like it's a board game.  It's the only product that doesn't come with three of every card (it has 3 of most cards, 2 of some, and only one of a few).  Since there is no card crossover and no other way to get those missing cards, most people start out with one core set, but many end up with 2 or three to have a full set of each card in it (because cards in the core set are ONLY in the core set).  Once you're ready to explore more of netrunner, the deluxe expansions each take one runner faction and one corp faction and really expands on each of those.  They each contain a playest of 55 different cards (so 165 cards total) that you wont find in any other packs.  They are purely from ONE corp and ONE runner faction and a few neutrals.  You probably wont be able to do much with JUST a deluxe expansion, but when combined with the core set it makes the factions it focuses on MUCH better.  Then you have the data packs.   There are 6 data packs in a themed cycle.  Each pack in a cycle has 3 each of 20 cards you will only find in that pack.  Each pack is themed slightly differently, but still fits into the major themes of the cycle, and contains a mix of cards for all factions."
Netrunner,3d5r8o,EnderAtreides,6,Mon Jul 13 19:09:30 2015 UTC,"It's fine to go over 45 when brewing and then do your cuts, but you should just tell yourself no by the time you get to 55. You need to refocus somewhat. First let's look at your core:  2x Corroder 2x Mimic 2x Yog.0 3x Sure Gamble 1x Account Siphon  These are your core breakers and economy (I'm ignoring armitage because playing resource economy in tag me is never a good idea, that should be one of the first cards to go), just 10 cards. And already there's a glaring problem. Even including recursion with SoT your economy is very limited, even with efficient breakers like Yog/Mimic/Corroder you're going to struggle to build up enough money to land a worthwhile vamp. When it comes to Siphon and vamp you should just pick one, and you need the econ from siphon and don't have the econ to support Vamp. The latter is best in decks that plan on always being richer than the corp while Siphon is for creating credit swings to disrupt scoring windows. And while we're on the subject one siphon isn't enough to be worthwhile. Being able to recur it with SoT and Deja Vu isn't worthwhile if you can't find it, and you have none of that all important Anarch draw power beyond IHW (which you don't actually want to be playing unless you're certain the deck you're playing against isn't going to try and kill you).  Let's look at your influence spend:  SMC? Three influence is just too expensive and as good a card as it is it just doesn't offer enough utility to justify that price. You're better off using your in faction draw power to get the cards you need rather than importing out of faction tutors.  Planned assault? Given that most of the time you're going to use this to search for account siphon you're better off replacing it (and something else) with another copy of Siphon.  Clone chip? Most of what you'll be recurring is parasites and Imps and you can do that fine with Deja Vu. It's not necessarily bad to leave it in but I'd reccommend cutting it for that all important siphon number 3.  Net-Ready Eyes? This is fine, it's pretty much mandatory if you want to be running Yog/Mimic actually.  Now let's look at what shouldn't be in there, what we've already covered aside:  Activist Support - This is always going to get trashed and unless you've already made the corp poor before playing it you're basically spending a click and a credit to make the corp spend a click and two credits. It's not very effective. Less effective than DLR and Joshua B because at least they have the potential to do something before they're trashed.  Cyberfeeder - Too slow.  But really I think you just need to break this deck down and figure out what you want it to do. Pick a direction and stick with it, that will give you the best guidance on what to cut and what to keep. Right now it's just a bit of econ denial here, a bit of disruption there, a bit of multi access over there with nothing really tying it all together except the concept of floating a lot of tags. And really tag-me should be a side-effect of what your deck does, not the entire strategy."

Netrunner,3d4w7l,landser92,11,Mon Jul 13 15:28:40 2015 UTC,"Your question is a little unclear. Can you describe a game situation in detail?  To answer what I think you're asking:  The runner runs on R&D with two unrezzed ice, and the corp rezzes an Ice Wall.  The runner breaks it with Corroder. Icebreaker type doesn't matter here, what matters is that Ice Wall is a barrier, and Corroder has the ability, ""Break barrier subroutine"".  The runner now approaches the second piece of ice, and the corp rezzes Enigma. Enigma is a Code Gate, so if the runner has an icebreaker installed that can break code gate subroutines (let's say Gordian Blade), he can pay 2 to break both subs and access R&D. If he doesn't have a code gate breaker installed, Enigma's subroutines will fire: First, the runner loses a click, if able. Then, the run ends.  Let me know if this doesn't answer your question fully."
Netrunner,3d4w7l,daytodave,7,Mon Jul 13 15:35:04 2015 UTC,Thank you for the replies. I see now out confusion started with us doing a run incorrectly.

Netrunner,3d4w7l,Salindurthas,16,Mon Jul 13 15:42:37 2015 UTC,"Something that wasn't mentioned, and should be just in case, is that you can pass ICE without icebreakers!  Some ICE doesn't end the run, like Shadow, Hunter, or Neural Katana. A runner can choose to accept the consequences of the subroutines on the ICE instead of breaking it (eg giving the Corp credits, possibly getting tagged via those traces, and taking net damage. It might not always be the right choice, it might even usually be the wrong choice, but it is a choice the runner can make and should be aware of."
Netrunner,3d4w7l,Horse625,2,Mon Jul 13 16:10:39 2015 UTC,"This is fairly common.  Everybody I've taught has tried to 'attack' with a certain breaker, sometimes even pushing it forward on the table and 'tapping' it, like it's a creature in Magic going up against blockers."
Netrunner,3d4w7l,Mechator_Rex,-1,Mon Jul 13 19:46:53 2015 UTC,"Wait. That would imply that the program does the run, instead of you, the hacker. That does not make any overall sense at all.  Going that track down the full way would imply you need also a program with the ability to ""attack"" the rnd  stack in the end.  That would be a funny redesign of nr. ^^ we should make a redesign about that :D But sending a program on a run is not a valid action. Going on a run onto a server is.

Netrunner,3d4w7l,BinarySecond,2,Mon Jul 13 15:35:11 2015 UTC,"From what I understand of your question: You encounter each piece of ICE one at a time. If the Icebreaker cannot break the a piece of ICE; the subroutines go off, in order."
Netrunner,3d4w7l,thesreynatwork,2,Mon Jul 13 15:42:17 2015 UTC,"From what I can gather, you seem to be under the impression that a Run constitutes ""Looking at every piece of ICE, using breakers then deciding if the run is successful or not.""  This isn't far off, but there are steps in between. Think of each piece of ICE as a checkpoint. You reach the first checkpoint, you have the breaker to beat that piece of ICE and you do so. You then get to choose if you want to approach the next checkpoint (ICE). If you do, the Corp chooses if they want to rez it. It seems in your example they did, now if you have a breaker that can break that ICE, you can do that. If you don't, then the subroutine(s) on the ICE fire.  Each piece of ICE is encountered individually, and if you break through one piece of ICE, but then have the run ended by another piece of ICE, nothing bad from the first piece of ICE happens. As an example, if you run into a Neural Katana and break it, then run into a Wall of Static but fail to break that, you already broke through the Katana and it does nothing to you."
Netrunner,3d4w7l,JohnQK,1 point,Mon Jul 13 15:42:55 2015 UTC,"Each piece of Ice protecting a server is handled individually, in something called an ""encounter.""  During each encounter, you can interact with the Ice using an Icebreaker. Once that encounter is over (the subroutines on the Ice are broken and/or resolved), you can move on to the next encounter with the next piece of Ice.  In the next encounter, you can interact with the Ice using any Icebreaker with the appropriate type, including the one you just used or one you haven't used yet. For most Icebreakers, you'll have to boost the strength again (some, like Pipeline or Gordian Blade, keep their strength for the whole run)."

Netrunner,3d4hvp,flamingtominohead,2,Mon Jul 13 13:32:46 2015 UTC,"For questions like these it's often helpful to refer back to the main rulebook (or faq) section on the timing of a run, as seen here  https://boardgamegeek.com/camo/a9af91b087433571cb3f137eb5ebe1fa82287492/687474703a2f2f63662e6765656b646f2d696d616765732e636f6d2f696d616765732f706963313539373334305f6c672e6a7067  As long as they rez and use Marcus batty at 4.3 or earlier, if he ends the run then the run stops there, and you will never get to 4.4.  You're only successful if you reach 4.4.  So yes, there is a step after all the ice, after caprice nisei psi games, and after the runner says ""I'm going to access cards/I'm going to Jack out"", where batty can still be used to end the run an make it unsuccessful.  It's also with noting that you have to say if your going to Jack out or not before 4.3, so if he knows you are going to access a trap he might choose a subroutine with damage instead, since you're already locked into your choice at that time and can't change your mind."

Netrunner,3d9wpj,Glitch29,4,Tue Jul 14 18:02:12 2015 UTC,"There's a big difference between wanting something for nothing, and wanting your partners in commerce to behave efficiently.  The first is whining that will fall on deaf ears, the second can be constructive advice that FFG might want to do something about.  If a few people are paying $60 for two additional core sets, and it costs FFG $20 to produce and distribute each of those.  FFG is netting $20, and most of the cards are being thrown away.  In this case, FFG is operating inefficiently by failing to address this issue.  And it is causing a loss for both themselves and their customers.  If instead they made a ""Core Completion"" Data Pack, which retailed for $30, and only cost them $10 to produce and distribute, both parties would be much happier.  Each customer already willing to spend $60 would then only have to spend $30.  People willing to pay up to $45 and previously were uninterested in completing their collection would now be getting it at $15 less than their maximum price.  FFG would still be netting $20/customer for people completing their core sets, but would have a greater number of customers doing so."
Netrunner,3d9wpj,vampire0,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:20:09 2015 UTC,"Only the ""paper waste"" argument is worse than this. Cards aren't being ""thrown away"" - FFG prints small batches in order to scale to demand - you may not recall but shortly after release Core sets were unavailable in stores as people snapped them up. It's like Opening Moves now. That's a false representation of the situation meant to make your position look tenable.  On to the ""numbers"" - let's be clear that you've pulled them out of thin air and they largely seem to be in the ""it's a smaller box so it must be cheaper to create"" line of reasoning. That is simply not true. First, it's not only about the cost to print the cards - you have additional costs in developing the packaging for the product, costs for manufacturing the second packaging, etc. you are also going to pay more to produce those things because of economies of scale - if I order 100000 units I'm gonna g to pay less to the printer per unit then if I order 1000 units. The number of these ""supplement packs"" would always be less than a Core set as it still requires a Core set to play, and if some portion of people that would buy 1-2 additional Cores instead buys a Supplement pack then you end up needing less Cores as well - again impacting your economy of scale and reducing profit on the Core sets themselves. Then one you produce the damn things you have a whole secondary set of inventory to track and distribution which causes more work all down the line, and all this is before you think about any impact to product recognition for the buyers.  Also, to finish out, one last simple point : FFG a is a company. If enough people actually had a problem with this setup, then they would loose money and switch tactics, but as someone else here has noted, they aren't. Instead they are releasing more games that are focused on 3x Core Sets being the norm. You may not like it, but it's the ultimate proof that as smart as any of us thinks we are, it's clearly the better economic choice for FFG to keep doing it."
Netrunner,3d9wpj,Glitch29,1 point,Wed Jul 15 00:51:16 2015 UTC,"First of all, you might want to reevaluate your attitude. It's a bit of a blurry line between ""argumentative"" and ""toxic"" but you are way on the far side of it.  The cards being thrown out that I'm referencing isn't an overprinting by FFG. It's the 4th-9th copy of core set cards that most people don't need. While they aren't always being thrown out, they have essentially zero value to the consumer.  A few things: A big part of my job is production management and cost analysis for a printing company. While obviously I've estimated the numbers, they should be reasonable enough for our purposes. Whatever amount I am off by doesn't change the point I've illustrated.  You may have an economics degree, but so do a lot of people. It doesn't mean you know anything about the specifics of FFG's production scale. Yes, there are setup costs for anything that's printed. No, knowing that doesn't make you special, or entitle you to act like a jerk.  Things like data packs have a much higher marginal unit cost that you're giving them credit for. Most of the cost is going to come from materials, printing, cutting, die-cutting, packaging, and distribution. While the setup for offset printing is not cheap (probably $800-$1000 to set up a data pack), it is pretty much the only fixed cost. Beyond that, you're average cost isn't scaling much at all.  The numbers on supplemental core sets versus base core sets were included in my prior comment. If FFG prices them correctly, it won't be a concern that they're competing somewhat with their core set sales.  Lastly, FFG is a small company. To pretend they're always operating at market equilibrium is wildly naive. A big part of operating any small business is listening to customers about what they want, because you don't have the market research capacity to magically intuit it. Sometimes it's right to ignore the customers if you think that someone is seriously misevaluating their own demand. But generally speaking, direct customer feedback provides useful data for finding those better economic choices.  By assuming they're always operating at maximum efficiency, you're assuming that they've made decisions about this sort of thing. But in the real world, it's just as likely that nobody there has had the time or inclination to evaluate the costs and benefits. The fact that they haven't made it yet is not anywhere near being proof of what is or isn't optimal."
Netrunner,3d9wpj,vampire0,3,Wed Jul 15 08:48:20 2015 UTC,"Point ceeded about if FFG has actually done their homework, but I think its still valid to think that so far, not enough customers are actually bulking at their tactics to cause an impact to their projections enough to change course, at least not if they have or are releasing 2 more sets that seem to focus on the 3x Core setup.  It also sounds like you do have more specifically applicable experience with this than I do - I might have missed it, but what are your thoughts on the economy of scale in this kind of printing? Would you say its a non-factor or an actual issue? Also, do you know what kind of packaging costs are involved? Printing is only part of the issue - separating and packing the cards into the boxes is another cost factor.  Also, yes, I realize I've crossed a line on this topic - I kind of mean to do that. I usually try to foster a welcoming environment, but I am still, still, super perplexed by these arguments because I can't find a reasonable motivation that would make people come on to forums like this and whine. My car didn't come with a luxury package - its not unfair that Honda didn't give it to me without paying for it, so there is no way that it is ""unfair"" to ask people to pay more if they want more out of the game (cards). Thats actually the same model as the data packs. As for the idea that these extra cards are ""waste"" - I don't really buy it. Yes you have to purchase the ""duplicates"" to get the 2x and 1x, but then you can deck build, or heck - give them to a friend to get them interested in the game. You get an extra set of tokens (and the single Core size set of tokens can be limited)... in other words I think that people that look at that extra card board as somehow damning need to get perspective. Heck, I played Magic for years and literally threw away cards I had just gotten out of packs because I couldn't even give them to people.  So.. in the end, I'm sorry if my ire was vented overly much on you, this issue just irks me quite a bit."
Netrunner,3d9wpj,_Pandaclysm,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:58:45 2015 UTC,By giving your friend the duplicates from the extra core sets aren't you perpetuating the issue? Your friend would now have to buy more core sets to round out his play set.  Why are you talking about Hondas? Your analogy here leaves me a little confused. I don't think cars are the right way to go. Since you're going that way I'll join you. It's like you have your Honda and you're buying additional Hondas for parts. Now you're left with a bunch of scrap.

Netrunner,3d9wpj,RS14-2,1 point,Wed Jul 15 01:58:11 2015 UTC,I'm re-reading our post history.

Netrunner,3d9wpj,Nevofix,0,Wed Jul 15 02:51:29 2015 UTC,"Alright, so I didn't say I want to pay more for cards. Did you notice I also didn't say I want to pay less? I will summarize my desire for your benefit.    I want a supplement pack because buying 3 core sets for a playset of each core set is unreasonable. Note, I'm not discussing price. If An easy point to make is the wastefulness of creating extra product that will most likely head to the trash.  Another is that FFG is removing the option of having an excess of nearly unusable cards. Another point is new player experience. How do you explain to new people that the best investment they can make is to purchase a second and third core set? ""Example, hey /r/netrunner! I just bought the core set and I am stoked to try out everything the game has to offer! What packs should I buy?? Another core set but I already own those cards. What do you mean I won't be able to build some top tier decks unless I own three of some of the one-ofs in the core set? Hey, I want to try a fast advance deck (which is a pretty basic strategy). what do I need? I need at least two SanSans? That requires a core set each. What about a deck featuring this awesome Criminal, Gabriel? I need multiple Desperados? >_> Gifting a single core set to a new player is like giving someone a puzzle without all of the pieces. Whereas, if you were able to give them a core set plus a core set supplement you'd be able to tell them to try out the game then when they want to try new ideas to open the supplement and experiment.

For the third core set, however, the price for the cards I care about would be $30 for 11 cards, and realistically only 5 of those I'm ever likely to use. Proxying a $6 card is more worthwhile.

Unlike other cards that implement sideboarding, this one imposes a MAJOR downside to your deckbuilding process that you have to account for. Not to mention that you have to track 90 cards, figuring out what is in each. It reduces the ability to ""hate-deck"" something because of the sheer overlap in most runner decks.  I would say that I'd probably add that neutral cards can have 3 of in each deck, or you'll struggle to include enough econ in the decks."

For a long, long time (and still now to a certain extent) corps eschewed big ICE entirely because of the very real possibility that their investment would get nuked by ES. Blue Sun was able to finally bring big ice back into the game regularly because of the lower likelihood of getting shutdown, but if you can get one in it's just ruinous to BS. Redcoats, the premier big ICE deck for a while, ran most of its taxers in the 5 or less money range and featured Vik2 in part because of how cheap it was compared to its tax. This is leaving behind how unpopular Illicit ICE was, given that you could be made to gain that bad pub over and over from Emergency Shutdown.  In short, Emergency Shutdown helped define the kinds of ICE that corps were willing to play by making corps run far far away from ICE that they'd hate to have to rez a few times. It should at least be a 4, and certainly more impactful than HQI which didn't see as much play and died off immediately once Legwork came out."

Netrunner,3d3yya,jontyld,1 point,Mon Jul 13 14:39:29 2015 UTC,"That seems a lot better than the earlier list. Try playing some games and see what you like and what you don't like. It seems to me like the deck might be lacking a direction. What I mean it's got a bunch of different ideas packed into it (drip econ with UWC and DF, cloud breakers, denial, R&D lock). I guess the idea is to mostly set up early game and pretty much only after that run the centrals and the remote if corp tries to score. You might have a problem in early game because you cannot reliably threaten a remote and faster corps (NBN FA, maybe HBFA) could even get away with scoring 7 before you're set up to lock the centrals. Especially vs HB the BnE suite needs a lot of breakers (4+) installed before they get you in.  That being said, against slower corps the possibility of locking R&D is definitely real. However, it still might not be a guaranteed win especially vs RP as their ICE will tax you a lot and the drip might not be enough. Breaking a Tollbooth with Zu or an Eli with Corroder is a pain and you cannot permanently get rid of those. The denial part of the plan does help with that, of course, but if you can't shut down the Sundews etc early, it could easily get way out of hand later.  I could be wrong on the early aggression part, there're 3 special orders and lots of breakers (but BnE are unreliable early), so maybe it is possible to get the pressure on early. That all needs testing though but maybe I've given you something to keep an eye out for when you do. Happy gaming! :)"

Remember, it actually needs the trash icon, so things like trashing Faerie after it was being used or trashing cards with Faust does not count.  And double-remember, to use a card with the trash icon, you need to be able to use actually resolve its ability. So while you can always trash Fall Guy for 2credit and a draw, you cannot arbitrarily trash Deus X just for the card draw."

Spend most of your inf on 3 copies of Levy and 1 or 2 Faust (since you can just throw in 3x Special Order) and no server would be safe. An Icebreaker that's effectively free to use with no real downside (except Swordsman and Turing) would break the game.
Netrunner,3d0uvc,haerik,5,Sun Jul 12 22:18:46 2015 UTC,"I've played a few games with Geist over the last couple days. He seems really good. I've drawn between 5 and 18 cards with his ability, depending on the length of the game. So in terms of pure numbers, he draws more than Andy.

Netrunner,3d0uvc,iamtom16,2,Sun Jul 12 16:29:38 2015 UTC,"Street Peddler is one of my favourite cards when I'm running Geist. It's a brilliant card by itself, and with the extra card draw that comes with Geist's ability, it's pretty great."

Netrunner,3d0uvc,haerik,1 point,Sun Jul 12 17:15:49 2015 UTC,"They're pretty versatile. Against most decks you can play it and immediately trash it for a card and two credits.  However, against kill decks they become even better, because you can trash it to draw after your tagged for a bit of extra protection. Or if they want to trash crash space so I can't prevent meat damage, you trash it to save crash space, which gets you a card and then they have to go to trash crash space again. If you have multiple fall guys and crash spaces out, you become pretty difficult to kill."

I haven't had to use it yet but before I put it in I ran into a few situations where I felt I needed it. Personally I think Forger is better in Geist than Desperado. I feel like you want to make big runs with Geist if you're running the B&E suite rather than frequent runs. And running often is the only way to get the mileage out of Desperado. Plus Forger gives you that all important 2 link so you can cut Dyson from the deck, since you don't get any real benefit out of the extra memory. And it can even be used for emergency tag removal, it can just stop a sea source dead in its tracks or shut down a breaking news traffic accident.  Grappling hook and E3 implants are also good includes in a Geist deck. And I feel like you can swap ZU for Rex to save on influence. You don't need everything in the cloud. Also I don't think I rate Crash Space, even in Geist you've still got the problem that most sources of meat damage require you to be tagged so it can just be trashed. Best case it forces the corp to spend a click and two credits.  I'd definitely add street peddler, and instead of adding another maker's eye add a third copy of Same Old Thing."

Even though Faust doesn't trigger his ability (infinite broken-ness, anyone?) he's already doing the work of replacing cards to mill to Faust faster than most. That alone gives him synergy. Also gives  him two econmoies (economy of creds, economy of cards). Combine with crescentusx3 and clone chip x3, he can potentially derez more ice for free [just card econ] than a corp can rez. Add in the siphon-connections, e-shutdowns/inside job for if he misses, Forged-Activations for if he hits, and the package just gets more brutal.  -AHMAD  EDIT Also should mention the obvious lest people think I forgot it: Street Peddler, GrapplingHook, SoT, and Fall Guy all work gloriously here.

Netrunner,3d0uvc,Xercies_jday,1 point,Mon Jul 13 03:25:06 2015 UTC,I only think you should probably use shiv as your cloud breaker replacing Faeries.

You might even use Tri-Maf because of fall guy and crash space synergy.

It's a slow start, but once you get the rig going it can be incredibly formidable. The deck slots are pretty extensive, but even with extra space given to Career Fair (to help install the drip for a faster return) you're looking at exactly zero influence for an econ engine and a strong set of incredibly efficient breakers. That leaves you with all of your influence for recursion, some back-up breakers, R&D pressure, and other out-of-faction staples.  The biggest weakness by far is the early game, and cards like Earthrise, Street Peddler, and the forthcoming Fiske Investment Seminar can definitely help accelerate.

Netrunner,3d0uvc,iamtom16,1 point,Sun Jul 12 19:52:11 2015 UTC,"At the moment, it's mostly experimental to see what works best. Forger seems to gel well with Geist (and our meta at the moment is pretty Scorched heavy).  I am also very new at deck building (this is one of the first I've published...), so I appreciate the feedback!"
Netrunner,3d0uvc,Rejusu,2,Sun Jul 12 22:33:59 2015 UTC,"It's a bit all over the place. And it's way too many cards. When building Runner decks always try to stick to the minimum number of cards. You might have all this stuff you want to include but the more you put in the lower the chances are that you'll draw the stuff you actually want.  Multiple types of consoles is nearly always a bad plan. Remember you can only ever have one installed and you don't have any cards that can get rid of it once it is (although Forger can be trashed if you ever take a tag). I'm guessing by the 2x Siphon and the 1x Desperado that you only have one core set. I would definitely cut the Desperado (as good as it is you don't have any synergy with it going on and with only one copy in the deck you have bad odds of drawing it early when it's most useful) and the Doppelganger and perhaps go to three Forgers. Or just a different console altogether.  Take out the Retrieval runs and swap them for Clone chips if you have them (they're in Creation & Control which also has another very good Geist card: Same Old Thing). Even if you don't I'd take them out and switch to less disposable breakers. Corroder is less influence than Lady and can be used more often for example.  Gormon Drip isn't terribly useful and you're tight on memory, it relies on the corp making inefficient plays and once it comes out they'll actively try to avoid ever triggering it. You only really need one copy of Sneakdoor, it's a situational card that you won't always want to play.  Ultimately you've got to ask yourself what your deck is trying to do. When you include a card ask yourself if it synergises with your ID ability or another card in your deck. If not is it a generally useful card that you'd always be happy to see (e.g. Sure Gamble). Avoid packing your deck with too many situational cards. Don't focus too much on the best or worst case scenarios. Those sacrificial constructs may save your butt against that rare deck hell-bent on destroying your rig, but they'll be dead draws against pretty much everything else."
Netrunner,3d0uvc,iamtom16,1 point,Sun Jul 12 23:14:51 2015 UTC,"Thanks! This is really helpful.  I'm picking up Creation & Control today, so I'll definitely try those changes."
Netrunner,3d0uvc,RogueCarpet,1 point,Mon Jul 13 08:02:10 2015 UTC,"Why Lady instead of Corroder? Lady costs you two more influence and your only recursion is Retrieval Run. For that matter, why Retrieval Run instead of Clone Chip? Sure, you might be able to cheat out a Femme but Clone Chip works really well with Geist.  Your memory is way too tight. At most you have 5. With your main three breakers up, that leaves only 2 MU left, which would get used up by Sneakdoor. I'd drop your Gorman Drips and probably the Sneakdoors too and use the extra memory on Crescentus and Faeries.  I'd cut the 3xCrypsis. This deck needs to keep up tempo and Crypsis is expensive and slow."

I'll definitely give Corroder a go, hopefully my FLGS gets C&C in soon so I can give Clone Chip a try (as I said, I'm really new, and my cardpool is a bit limited)."
Netrunner,3d0uvc,RogueCarpet,1 point,Sun Jul 12 22:23:49 2015 UTC,"Yeah, Geist with a limited card pool is like deckbuilding hard mode. Good luck with it, but don't be too discouraged if it is rough to get going.

Netrunner,3d0uvc,Rejusu,3,Sun Jul 12 22:44:34 2015 UTC,"I don't think you want drip economy in him, I tried it and it doesn't work. The cloud breakers on the other hand have a big benefit in Geist. They're self-reinforcing. You run, use them, draw more of them. Or you draw clone chips, or peddlers, or SoT which let you draw more stuff. They make for incredibly cheap runs. Most players have gotten into the habit of watching a players credit pool to see when it's safe to score out. A poor runner can't fuel their breakers and so can't get in. Not the case with a handful of cloud breakers backed up with a couple of real breakers and grappling hook. I had a game where I got handed a Government Takeover, the obvious intent to double punitive me next turn (they'd need two as it's trivial for Geist to get to six cards on the corps turn). I had 4 credits and they had ICE three deep on HQ and R&D so they were confident I couldn't get in. Same old makers eye, cloud breaker off the peddler for the first piece, grappling hook the enigma, and then clone chip out another cloud breaker for the last piece. Hit two agendas.  Now while the access was a best case scenario the run is actually how average cloud Geist runs go. You almost play him like a Shaper, you've just got a whole toolbox of options for getting in and it's all hyper efficient."

I've heard good things about the connections version but the breaking & entering tools (what I've been testing) really reactivate Criminal's run economy. Dirty Laundry is almost risk free once you get a few of these down, and you can regularly blind siphon by turn 3 even if they double ICE HQ. If you've got Crescentus on the table, corps really don't like rezzing that archives/empty remote ice to stop your sec testing since you'll break it for free, derez it, gain your money and draw two cards for your trouble.  Note that I feel like you absolutely HAVE TO HAVE some real breakers to back up the cloud, too. If you don't run real breakers (or run the central only ones) then you're giving the corp an opportunity to tax out your breakers with cheap ICE even faster than they can tax Lady, and you have less recursion. Don't make yourself blow Spike on Wraparound; save it for Eli. I run 3x Faerie, 1x Corroder and 1x Zu.13. I had mimic in there before but I pulled it for a 3rd street peddler, since that's awesome. If Architect shows up everywhere again, I'll swap back.  I've also played the B&E breakers in Andy and I think that's strong, too, but you need to put more card draw into the deck and have less room for pressure cards.

Netrunner,3d1of7,grimwalker,2,Sun Jul 12 20:13:27 2015 UTC,"This is based on Scholar of Stealth and I'm determined to differentiate it. Hayley has been my jam from the moment I laid eyes on her, and SoS does everything I've been trying to get the deck to do.  I was convinced by this thread on Stimhack that Street Peddler had a lot of what I was looking for in this deck: Draw power, corp turn installs, click efficiency, economy.   But, that gave me some problems. I needed to pack more recursion, so I upped the Clone Chips to 3 and added a Levy. Influence was a problem, though! I couldn't lose my Silencers or Switchblade. I'll be giving myself fewer Career Fair targets with SP, so I dropped that by one, and gritted my teeth and dropped Corroder.  I could probably bring back the Corroder if I dropped 2 more Career Fair and replaced them with Aesops, that would definitely be a credit swing and less taxing on my card draw, which I have less raw power in having dropped the Earthrises for the Peddler slot.   Comments and discussion over on NRDB?"
Netrunner,3d1of7,SevenCs,2,Sun Jul 12 20:22:57 2015 UTC,"I like the idea.  I think -2 Career Fair, +1 Parasite -- brings you down to 45 cards, and the only thing it looks like Career Fair is good for is Daily Casts, maybe Kati and Visage -- so 5 cards out of 46?  Conversely I think Parasite will be very useful."
Netrunner,3d1of7,HepatitvsJ,2,Sun Jul 12 21:11:23 2015 UTC,"Definitely dropping Career Fair. Without Earthrise around, it's not pulling its weight. So freeing up 2 influence. Corroder or Parasite?"
Netrunner,3d1of7,Nevofix,3,Sun Jul 12 21:53:28 2015 UTC,Parasite is strong with 3 clone chips. You have lady in faction to replace corroder. Parasite by a wide margin imo.

Netrunner,3d0ggw,marimbist11,3,Sun Jul 12 15:13:36 2015 UTC,"So saving a click would be used for getting rid of a potential tag?    One of the short games ended in one of the corporations turns, where he tagged me and played that card all at once."
Netrunner,3d0ggw,treiral,5,Sun Jul 12 17:21:40 2015 UTC,"Exactly. Saving clicks to clear potential tags is one way of dealing with that threat, but also being able to keep up you credit pool to avoid being tagged with SEA source on the Corps turn"
Netrunner,3d0ggw,GarlicSausage,3,Sun Jul 12 17:35:52 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that also happens. Corps have a few ways to place a tag on the runner during his own turn. From the core set:   SEA Source, there's a trace involved, this is the most common way. Posted Bounty, advance, score, and forfeit to place a tag on the runner. Usually in the timespan of 2 turns where the Corp Install, Advance, Advance. Leaving the next turn for Advance and score, Scorched Earth, Scorched Earth. Obviously it's a finisher unless the runner is playing Decoy or Crash Space. Breaking News. Almost like before, advance and score to place 2 tags on the runner. Here the runner can't use a single Decoy to avoid the 2 tags. Data Raven's power counters. Just like that. The Corp don't even need a click to use the power counter. If Data Raven has a counter, the Runner might aswell consider himself tagged already."

You just need to weigh the pros and cons and do the math to make sure you're making the right call.  You'll always remember the few games you lose because you ran on the last click.

Netrunner,3d176m,RS14-2,9,Sun Jul 12 17:52:51 2015 UTC,"It depends on the ice. In this case, Information Overload has a constant ability determining the number of subs from the number of tags you have, so by getting a new tag during the resolution of the first subroutine it is now there to resolve.   That is my reading of the situation.  The answer really depends on what exactly the ""trigger"" for subroutines is, but Lukas has been very doggy with answering that question the half dozen times I've asked him."
Netrunner,3d176m,Jakodrako,3,Sun Jul 12 18:20:53 2015 UTC,"I think that's right.  Given that unbroken subroutines resolve in order, if a piece of ice gains a subroutine during the resolution of one subroutine, I would think the new subroutine would also resolve."
Netrunner,3d176m,SevenCs,1 point,Sun Jul 12 21:25:48 2015 UTC,"That would depend on the order in which the new subroutine appears.  Does it appear above the fired sub or below?  Or do be more precise is the first sub for the first tag and the last sub for the last tag or is the order in reverse?  Actually I am pretty sure cascading effects will be suppressed as much as possible and the new sub would not fire at all, otherwise who knows what broken stuff we might see in the future..."
Netrunner,3d176m,eulennatzer,1 point,Mon Jul 13 08:14:57 2015 UTC,"This is the relevant ruling. This situation is a bit different, but I think similar enough that we can use this as a baseline, implying that the second sub would fire."
Netrunner,3d176m,KnowledgeRuinsFun,1 point,Mon Jul 13 16:25:48 2015 UTC,"Considering that ruling, can you break possible appearing subroutines in advance?  I mean that could result in unbreakable subs by some effects in the future, right?"
Netrunner,3d176m,eulennatzer,1 point,Mon Jul 13 16:51:09 2015 UTC,"I guess you could break more than the current number of subs, just in case more subs appear later, but there are no paid ability windows between ""subs broken"" and ""subs fire"", so the extra subs cannot come from a corp paid ability, it must be because of some other trigger, like what's happening in this example."
Netrunner,3d176m,KnowledgeRuinsFun,2,Mon Jul 13 23:55:05 2015 UTC,"It probably gets a chance to fire, since the new subroutine appears when the first one is being resolved."

Netrunner,3d176m,Lowsow,1 point,Mon Jul 13 02:29:57 2015 UTC,"Well, in THIS case, the corp can't rez TMI until after the runner has finished encountering Information Overload.  So even though it gains a sub, the runner is no longer encountering it, and its subs already fired, so nothing happens.  (Unless something forces the runner to encounter it again.)  There is a paid window when the runner is encountering ice, in which both players can play paid effects.  This is when runners usually break subroutines.  If the corp had some way to throw more tags on the runner during this window, then the runner would still have to break them, or else they would fire.  Once subroutines fire though, any new ones that get added are basically ignored, since that ice already had its chance to ""go off."""
Netrunner,3d176m,Bwob,2,Mon Jul 13 04:02:06 2015 UTC,"In this scenario, Information Overload is important because it lets us trash Muertos Gang Member (and thus rez TMI and give a tag) outside of the 3.1 paid ability window."
Netrunner,3d176m,Bwob,1 point,Mon Jul 13 04:06:00 2015 UTC,"Oh whoops!  I totally misread what was going on!  (Forgot about Muertos's secondary ability.)  Hmm.  Yes, that is a bit less cut-and-dry.  I was figuring it was probably pretty solvable, as long as tags only happened during paid ability windows, but changing the # of subroutines while other subroutines are firing makes things more interesting.  it certainly SEEMS like the new (and hence unbroken) subroutine should fire?  Cool edge case either way!"
Netrunner,3d176m,Salindurthas,1 point,Mon Jul 13 04:24:18 2015 UTC,"I think you should edit the question for clarity. Use bold/italitcs to emphasise the key parts of the logic. The first time I read it I thought that TMI was rezzed when the runner approached it after TMI, and didn't pick up that the gang member was how it was rezzed.  Try something like the following:   They encounter Information Overload, beat the trace, trash Muertos Gang Member to the single subroutine, the gang member triggers so the corp chooses to rez TMI. Infromation overload now gains a second subroutine during the resolution of the first subroutine. Can this subroutine fire?"
Netrunner,3d176m,eulennatzer,1 point,Mon Jul 13 06:28:59 2015 UTC,"Got the question wrong the first time, so I will answer again:  First of all if Overload can gain subroutines while subroutines are firing we get some sort of cascading bullshit that might break the game in the future, maybe. So I am pretty sure any official ruling will disallow that.  Also we do not know the order in which the new subroutine appears. Maybe it will appear on top of the fired one and not resolve at all. (Subroutines fire in order)  3.2 Resolve all subroutines not broken on the encountered ice. If this is a trigger like ""when your turn begins"" then the new sub would not fire.  Overall I think this is one of those edge cases that can not be ruled with the current FAQ because there are too many unknowns.  If the subroutine is gained on top of the old one we have no issue at all. If subs are counted once (3.2 as trigger) and then processed one by one we also have no problem, I guess. If the new subroutine really might appear and fire the game might run into some serious issues in the future..."
Netrunner,3d176m,Jakodrako,1 point,Mon Jul 13 08:24:19 2015 UTC,"Another scenario: Suppose the runner hits Chum, then Information Overload with two tags. When the first subroutine resolves, Chum deals 3 damage. The runner trashes Sacrificial Clone to prevent this damage, and also removes all tags. Does Information Overload still have a subroutine that fires?"
Netrunner,3d176m,eulennatzer,1 point,Mon Jul 13 17:00:52 2015 UTC,"No, there are now no subroutines on Information Overload to resolve.   (But again, the exact timing of subroutine triggers might change the answer. I doubt it tho, as even if all the subs have triggered and are waiting to be resolved, being no longer active would cause them to fizzle [such as Aesop's trashing Wyldside].)"
Netrunner,3d176m,Lowsow,1 point,Mon Jul 13 17:31:17 2015 UTC,"Ice behave like gates:  You approach the gate, maybe unlock it and then once you are past it, you don't care for it anymore.  Once the runner has broken all subroutines he wants to break, he tells you to run any remaining one. After that you only care for the next ice, the passed one is of no more interest."
Netrunner,3d176m,Aramile,3,Sun Jul 12 18:06:00 2015 UTC,"You seem to have misunderstood the question, which involves information overload gaining a subroutine as a result of the execution of it's subroutine."
Netrunner,3d176m,Lowsow,1 point,Mon Jul 13 02:32:25 2015 UTC,"So, while the ICE gains the subroutine, we have passed the point in the run where it can make a difference. Now that the runner has declared which subroutines he is breaking (in this case not breaking), the unbroken subroutines will fire. Any new subroutines that have been created as a result, either directly or indirectly, of a subroutine will not fire. They exist on the ICE but they didn't exist when they needed to.  EDIT: To entertain the idea that it works the other way, Let's say the runner decided to let the one subroutine fire the way your story says it did and IO gains another sub from TMI rezzing yada yada... How then does the runner get to break this subroutine? We have passed the point in the game where ice breaker abilities can be used to break subroutines."
Netrunner,3d176m,Salindurthas,3,Mon Jul 13 00:17:18 2015 UTC,"There is nothing in the rulebook that says the runner should have a chance to break the subroutine, or that subroutines must exist during the use icebreakers step to be considered unbroken."

Netrunner,3cz2ng,dy_over_dsex,5,Sun Jul 12 02:13:12 2015 UTC,"I think this may help.  It's from the guide in this subreddit's sidebar https://www.reddit.com/r/Netrunner/wiki/deckarchetypes  Also, theres are some past ""archetypes"" threads we've had in this subreddit (i searched for things i've commented on with the terms ""archetypes"" and ""deck types"") https://www.reddit.com/r/Netrunner/comments/331di7/thinking_about_getting_into_netrunner_help_with/ https://www.reddit.com/r/Netrunner/comments/32e1w0/newbie_questions_about_expanding_collection/cqbiz4l  In general, Just find some decklists that won or placed in the top 4 in regionals, and read their description, and play them a bunch.  You're going to need to build up netrunner knowledge a bit anyways.  If you have any questions, come back and ask, and we'll point out why some cards are used instead of others, and how you beat X.  In general decks you'll want to know are (in no particular order): Blue sun - big ice, project atlas, and some flatline condition, either gov takeover+punitive or sea source and scorched earth. Replicating perfection  -  cards that make it hard to run successfully and tax the runner hard on clicks and money - caprice nisei, nisei markII, enhanced login protocol, Marcus Batty, excaliber, ash 2x, napd contract, future perfect NEH - fastrobiotics - never let an agenda sit on the table, play and score them in one turn.  AstroScript Pilot Program + san san city grid + biotic labor and etc.  Go fast, win fast.  Small, taxing, cheap ETR ice for the most part.  A big issue with this deck was the release of the card ""clot"", but people just put in cards like shipment from sansan and cyberdex virus to deal with it, and it's not as common to face as a lot of people think. NEH - butchershop - half fastrobiotics, half tagging cards like data raven and guetenburg and Midseason replacements and breaking news.  Then kill with traffic accident/sea scorched. HB ETF - the specifics vary wildly, but generally it's set up a lot of very taxing ice somewhat slowly, like eli and the NEXT ice, then put an agenda + ash2x in a server and score agendas.  Get a lot of money from assets to let you rez all that ice, bleed the runner dry, and sometimes use biotic labor to score an agenda if the runner is being to cautious and trying to stockpile cash to beat your servers. PE death by 1000 cuts -  a lot of small agendas, traps, and damaging ice.  Can flatline, but it's more common to just tax the runner 1-2 cards a turn until they run out of cards, then score when they can't afford to take damage or run out of cards in their deck.  Noiseshop -   Play a lot of viruses to mill a lot of cards.   Make a big turn where you put a lot of counters on hivemind and hit R&D for a big run with the card medium, made even bigger by also using either showing off or demolition run. Keyhole/eater - play some arnarch, use keyhole+eater to put agendas in the trash, use hades shard to go get them.  Has trouble with turing/swordsman, and lots of taxin R&D ice, so uses ice destruction cards like parasite and knifed/forked/spooned, and uses mimic and yog sometimes as well. Prepaid kate - pay any number of different icebreaker suites.  Get a lot of money from cheap prepaid voicepads+money events, then use self modifying code to find the right super efficient breaker at the right time.  very toolboxy. stealth andromdeda - use that big hand size to find all your super cheap stealth cards early.  assemble your stealth rig, then run for free and gain money off of security testing/desperado. also, a wide variety of interchangeable anarch builds using either datasucker+mimic/yog+netready eyes to break things cheap Headlock reina - get the corp low on credits and without good ice and keep them there.  Destroy their early ice with parasite and the forked/spooned/knifed, use lamprey/vamp/account siphon to bleed them dry while you're gaining credits with desperado, use clone chip to get back anything they trash (like lamprey).  Imp can take out any assets or economy operations they might have that might gain them money.  keep them poor and iceless, run early and often."
Netrunner,3cz2ng,RestarttGaming,5,Sun Jul 12 02:55:46 2015 UTC,"In general, archetpes are sometimes a littler harder to pin down card for card in netrunner because of the different parts of the game, especially for the runner.  While your whole deck should be synergistic and work well together, you can also mix and match different economies with different breakers with different multiaccess cards within the same IDs.  So a deck might run one of many economies, from prepaid voicepad +(dirty laundry, lucky find, sure gamble, same old thing, other events) to Magnum opus to security testing+desperado to supplier+(daily casts, liberated accounts, etc), to dripecon like data folding and underworld.  And they can mix and match a lot of those.  Then they can run any breaker suite they want with that (fixed breakers+datascuker, stealth breakers+stealth credits, cheap early breakers, really expensive to play but efficient breakers, etc).   Then with that you can run any of the multiaccess HQ you want (HQ interface, legwork, nerve agent).  Then with that you can run any of the multiaccess r&D you want (R&D interface, medium, makers eye, indexing).  Now some of these combo better than others - prepaid voicepad economy works well with legwork and makers eye, making them cheaper and it's already running same old thing.  Stealth decks mix their economies with their breaker suites.   Magnum opus econ probably doesn't work well with stealth or datascukers because you need a lot of memory.  Security testing/desperado works really well with stealth because your economy is run based, and you can usually make a run for free with stealth credits.  The interfaces work really well with supplier, where as the medium/nerve agent work well with breakers that dont take up much MU.  But even still, theres plenty of room between the different parts of the decks for the decks to have a bunch of different cards.  Then most decks also have ""other"" cards to deal with common problems depending on their meta call.   Plascrete carapice is a favorite vs meat damage flatline decks, cards with expose or deus x often help vs trap heavy decks,  cards that steal credits like vamp and caprice are good against psi game decks that use a lot of caprice nisei (and/or ash 2x).   Cyberdex virus suite is good against virus decks, and also helps fast advance decks vs clot.  I've had worse is great against damage decks.  Theres somewhat similar things going on in corps, to a slightly lesser degree (ice choices, econ choices, agenda choices, other strats (flatline, etc)  So theres SO MANY possible combos that even the popular decks often have a bunch of different cards in them.  I've played magic competitively too, and it's much easier to define an archtype there, and the cards are more similar between decks within the same archetype in magic.  One of the reasons is the bluffing is at the core of netrunner, and theres a lot of relevant hidden information, so it pays for people to deviate from the norm if they're still really efficient.  Never the less, you'll get it.   After playing a few games both as and against the popular decks, you'll start to be able to guess what each facedown card is with at least some level of confidence.  It will take a while to learn, but keep coming back with any questions"
Netrunner,3cz2ng,RestarttGaming,1 point,Sun Jul 12 03:04:07 2015 UTC,"""clot"", but people just put in cards like shipment from sansan and cyberdex virus to deal with it   Newbie here: how does Shipment from Sansan help deal with Clot?"
Netrunner,3cz2ng,stormblooper,3,Sun Jul 12 16:18:14 2015 UTC,"To add on to what Rjayz said - Netrunner's paid abilities are different from Magic. In Netrunner, during a paid ability window, the active players can use all the paid abilities they would like and then they pass to their opponent who uses all the paid abilities they'd like and then they defer back to the active player and this process continues until both players decline to use any paid abilities.  So in this situation the NBN player has a SanSan City Grid face down in a remote server. Click 1: They install an AstroScript Pilot Program face down. In between Clicks 1 and 2: The NBN player declines to use any paid abilities. The Runner has a chance to either search their Stack via Self-Modifying Code for, or retrieve from their Heap via Clone Chip, a Clot. If the Runner declines to do so the NBN player is free to use his next action. Clicks 2 and 3: The NBN player then plays Shipments from SanSan, which is a ""Double"" which requires the player to spend two clicks to use, to place 2 advancement tokens at once on the ASPP, after which, as the active player, has priority to use paid abilities. The NBN players rezzes SSCG and scores the ASPP before the Runner has a chance to react.  As Rjayz explains if the NBN player installs the ASPP on first click, advances it on the second click manually, the runner has a chance inbetween clicks 2 and 3 to install Clot."
Netrunner,3cz2ng,ElderMason,2,Sun Jul 12 19:50:42 2015 UTC,"It forces your opponent to immediately get Clot after you install the agenda, because if he doesn't, you can play Shipment from SanSan and score immediately after with an Astroscript counter or SanSan city grid. This means your opponent can't wait for the first advancement to go get Clot, and everything you put down is potentially an agenda, making the decision to get Clot harder for your opponent."
Netrunner,3cz2ng,Rjayz,2,Sun Jul 12 16:29:13 2015 UTC,"So a lot of times clot isn't actually on the board.  Instead, the runner is waiting for the Corp to play an agenda, then search clot out via clone chip or self modifying code.  Now, the runner doesn't just want to find clot any time a face down card is played, because then they might get it in response to an asset instead of agenda, and the Corp can just purge it.  So, many times the runner will wait till something is advanced once to then get clot, so they're more sure it's an agenda.   However, if you play something face down and the runner doesn't find clot, you can play shipment from San San then use either an astroscript token or rez a San San city grid to get three three advancements all at once, and score the agenda before the runner has a window to get clot.  Normally the runner has a window to do things before and after each click action.  So if you do at least two click:advance actions, there's a window in between them where the runner can get clot.  Shipment helps move all your advancements to one click+ abilities, which means the runner has to find clot every time you play something face down, because otherwise you are going to bring it from 0 to scored before they can react."

In a world in which low-strength ice is already considered Parasite bait, adding yet another way to invalidate them seems bad.  Now, I think a way to fix this might be to add a drawback. A couple of ideas:   make increasing link more expensive for the runner (2 credits per 1 link in traces?) - note that this further incentivizes having link  make the Runner bid first in traces  add some ""if unsuccessful"" clause to each trace - Corp gains X credits?  flat increase to the strength of all ice"

Kinda the way blackguard-snitch or monolith are pretty useless regardless of their abilities because of their price. Though I suppose you'd need to add 3creds to hit blackguard level.  But as you put it - invalidating low strength ice is already a thing we can do and it hasn't broken the game.  That being said, I do think giving all ice +1 str (or making it Trace X+1 -- either way), as well as saying all subroutines  cost +1credit to break (so you can't just mix-and-match console+breaker suite) would be a good idea to combat the runner's natural link. Leave it up to the corp to play the current to reverse the bidding order.  And I didn't think of power tap. Yeah, Power tap is evil. Especially with 3-4 link, the corp will need to trash their own ice on their rezzed, weak servers or let you ""free-magnum"" or worse for days.

Netrunner,3cx429,JohnQK,-1,Sat Jul 18 02:12:57 2015 UTC,"Great card if one of the top three cards of your stack is appropriate for the situation, can be installed, and isn't something you have already installed. Useless/harmful card if not.   This card has a ton of really excited best case scenarios that make it very attractive, but in most games it'll just be a semi-modded."
Netrunner,3cx429,RepoRogue,5,Sat Jul 11 15:37:50 2015 UTC,"Your comparison to Modded is way off. First of all, let's considered some worst case scenarios:  The top three cards of your deck are all events. This is the only time that Street Peddler is bad, and can be avoided by not putting it into event heavy decks. In this case, those events are basically lost. You do get the benefit of cycling through your deck faster for whatever you wanted to install, since you presumably wouldn't have played the card had you not wanted to install something.  The top of your deck contains entirely unique cards and copies of icebreakers. This is actually not a bad thing at all, since it means you've gotten those cards out of your deck, making all future draws more valuable. (This case is very similar to drawing all of those cards with a Diesel, an undeniably powerful econ card.)  More than one of the cards Street Peddler hits are cards you want to install. This could be a problem, but is only really bad if you have; no recursion, lots of one offs which your deck relies on, (a terrible idea) or have already discarded the others copies of those cards. Pretty much all non-Criminals run recursion, or should be doing so, so case one isn't an issue outside of that faction. Case two will only happen if you've built your deck quite poorly, and case three can be avoided by not playing Street Peddler after you've discarded all of your extra key cards.  Those are the three worst case scenarios, and only the first one is bad. (Even then, it's often at worse a neutral effect.) If you're playing Street Peddler with a fair few things which can be installed, then it's usually going to be a pretty big tempo boost."
Netrunner,3cx429,Bwob,1 point,Sat Jul 11 16:47:19 2015 UTC,"No, I think the modded comparison is reasonable.  Playing modded gives you a free click (for the install) and 3 credits.  Playing Street Peddler gives you two free clicks (for the draw and the install) and 1 credit.  The only time street peddler is better is if it hits a card where that you know you'l need eventually, and that is useful to keep hidden.  Early-game, hitting an icebreaker can be useful, since you can put off installing it.  (And hide that you have it.)  But if you hit things like economy cards, (Cyber-Feeder, Liberated Accounts, Daily Casts, etc) then you probably want to just install them right away and start benefitting from them.  Don't get me wrong, I think it's a neat card.  But I agree with JohnQK, that a lot of the speculation on it has focused heavily on the best-case scenarios, and I'm not convinced yet that those will be the average scenarios."
Netrunner,3cx429,RepoRogue,7,Sat Jul 11 17:31:16 2015 UTC,"Unlike Modded, Street Peddler doesn't require you have another card in hand to be played. That's pretty big in and of itself. Additionally, Street Peddler not only saves you the click of drawing a card, but allows you to filter which card you draw. Thinking of it like a hybrid between Diesel, Modded, and Career Fair is probably more appropriate, since it has some of the functionality of each one of those cards."
Netrunner,3cx429,Bwob,1 point,Sat Jul 11 17:37:18 2015 UTC,"Unlike Modded, Street Peddler doesn't require you have another card in hand to be played.   To be fair, I DID say that - Playing Street Peddler gives you two free clicks (for the draw and the install) and 1 credit.  The filtering is definitely a factor, but on the flip side, so is the possibility of having it flat-out fail, if you don't draw anything useful with it."
Netrunner,3cx429,RepoRogue,2,Sat Jul 11 17:57:17 2015 UTC,I would counter the possibility of failing by pointing to my earliest comment in this thread; most of the worst case scenarios are still at least somewhat helpful.
Netrunner,3cx429,Bwob,1 point,Sat Jul 11 18:10:57 2015 UTC,"My point is that if you want to sum up all its effects, it's basically:  + Filtering + 1[c](/c) worth of discount + 2 clicks worth of effort (card draw/install) - chance to fizzle   I (completely arbitrarily) decided that the chance to fizzle roughly balanced out the filtering, which leaves us with something very much like modded/career fair.  (2c less discount, but +click.  A fair trade.)"
Netrunner,3cx429,rumirumirumirumi,3,Sat Jul 11 18:19:10 2015 UTC,"Your breakdown doesn't account for the paid ability install and the fact it can install any type of card, and you get to bank the install to whenever you want. These are aspects of SP that I think are very key to making it one of the best cards in the pack."
Netrunner,3cx429,Bwob,1 point,Sat Jul 11 18:23:19 2015 UTC,"Ahh, dangit!  I meant to include the instant install, and then totally brain-froze.  You are exactly right.  I think what will really make or break SP is how often you can make the instant install actually matter.  For a lot of cards, there is little value in hiding it.  (Econ resources, for example.)  And for some, you actually want them on the board as early as possible.  (Link, if you're running underworld contacts, etc.)  So we'll see!  That said, your Geist deck seems like a good one for that, since instant-installing icebreakers is known to be awesome."
Netrunner,3cx429,rumirumirumirumi,2,Sat Jul 11 19:36:37 2015 UTC,"One should weigh the likelihood of a worst case scenario (events, multiple must-haves, or a bunch of blah) when thinking about including it in their deck. You want to minimize the number of events and ensure you have some level of recursion in your deck if you're going to use this. And even in that case you are taking some risks when you play it. But the flexibility it offers is pretty off the charts.  I think it also comes down to playstyle. I know people who hate to trash cards from their grip, so they'll either keep from drawing up or twist themselves in knots trying to install cards they don't need. A player like that isn't going to value SP very much because they'll be sad to see the cards go unused even at the payout of faster movement through the deck and instant speed install."
Netrunner,3cx429,Bwob,0,Sat Jul 11 18:02:29 2015 UTC,"Sure, but one should ALSO weigh the likelyhood of best-case scenarios when including things in your deck.  I mean, the best case for Kraken is that it can trash a curtain wall for only 3 credits!  Amazing!  But people don't use it much, because the times where it is ""meh"" far outweigh the times where it is awesome.  I'm not saying Street Peddler is like Kraken.  (And for that matter, Kraken is probably better than most people give it credit for being.)  But I think the ""off the charts"" flexibility people are thinking Street Peddler gives is a bit optimistic.  People tend to think about cards in terms of the best outcome, instead of the average.  (I think this is why everyone is freaking out over Marcus Batty too.)  And on average, I think street peddler is going to end up being a lot more like Modded than like clone-chip.  Which is fine!  Modded is still a really solid card, and even if you just use Street Peddler as economy/tempo boost, that's still decent!  I just don't think it will usually end up being the amazing, deck-changing, cycle-defining card people seem to expect.  But I guess we'll see in a few months!"
Netrunner,3cx429,rumirumirumirumi,3,Sat Jul 11 18:34:54 2015 UTC,"The cards that tend to be busts are ones that have big effects. SP doesn't strike me as that sort of card. Ignoring ideal situations like Liberated install on a Stimhack run, or perfect Parasite plays, its average scenario in a deck that fits is really good.  You mentioned how installing econ from SP would be a pretty weak use of it, but there are lots of econ cards you could install that would actually be pretty nice. Saving clocks is good for click intensive econ like Armitage or Kati Jones. It would be good to break even on a Daily Cast the moment it's played, or get essentially anything with an immediate trigger down the moment before the trigger. As long as you have cards in your deck that benefit from SP (which is almost anything you can install), it's going to be useful almost every time.  EDIT: maybe the biggest thug too is you install 1 of 3 cards. This greatly reduces the odds of a bad Peddler."
Netrunner,3cx429,Bwob,0,Sat Jul 11 18:51:16 2015 UTC,"Oh sure, I'm not saying it won't be useful.  Modded and Career fair are useful.  I'm just saying that in most cases, I don't expect Street Peddler to be significantly MORE useful than Modded or Career fair.  (Which ALSO lets you play Daily Casts and break even the moment it's played.)"
Netrunner,3cx429,rumirumirumirumi,2,Sat Jul 11 18:53:59 2015 UTC,"I guess I don't understand your perspective. If Career Fair is just as useful as SP for installing resources, then shouldn't SP be significantly more useful because it can install hardware and programs too? And do so in any paid ability window, and give you options on what you actually want to install? It sounds like it's on par with those events only if you ignore the things that make it unique from them.  But who knows, maybe I'll be eating crow on this. I'm, playing Geist right now so Peddler is even better, but I'm also playing Career Fair too."
Netrunner,3cx429,Bwob,0,Sat Jul 11 19:04:54 2015 UTC,"I'm probably just not doing a good job of describing my perspective.  SP's ability to install anything is great!  But the fact that you're limited to one of the 3 things you find when you install it is its biggest weakness.  Career Fair can only install one type of thing, but it gives you about the same discount as street peddler (2[c](c/) for 1click is a pretty standard conversion).  So one way of viewing it is that SP is career fair, except where you get the ability to install any type of thing, (and the ability to install it instantly) in exchange for most of your ability to actually pick which thing you want to install.  Definitely has a lot of neat potential - (who hasn't dreamed of plays like insta-installing a Forger and sacrificing it to lose a tag, right after the corp spends most of their bankroll on a SEA-Source?) - but it remains to be seen how often that kind of play will actually happen, vs. how often it will just be an an arch-themed modded/career fair."
Netrunner,3cx429,ZoidbergMD,5,Sat Jul 11 19:30:04 2015 UTC,"Useless/harmful card if not.   You have to draw those top three cards anyway, and now you did it for a click and 0 cred (aka anarch diesel), how is that of no use?"

And if none of them are particularly useful right now? Well you've burned through three useless draws for a click.

It essentially forces you to burn two cards on econ instead of just one, less than ideal when you want every card possible for breaking with faust.

Netrunner,3cx5jl,xxayn,2,Sat Jul 11 17:30:25 2015 UTC,"Good thoughts.   Speaking of cards, Zule is one that takes care of Turing on remotes and centrals. Parasite and David seem like a less consistent answer, though parasite may be a good include on account of both Grimoire and Faust.  Career fair helps you get wyldsyde and pancakes up earlier with less risk of dropping below key credit range. Day job also has anti synergy with Wyldsyde. I'd consider lucky find if influence werent so tight. But try career fair if you haven't. It gets you credits via casts or cards via wyldside so fast. If you're low on creds using it on anything can save you 3 clicks or so."

Netrunner,3cwxbg,unitled,2,Sat Jul 11 16:05:04 2015 UTC,"NBN just has a bunch of really good agendas. Astro and Beale are easy 3 ofs. If you include Breaking News, you have a really easy path to scoring out.  I used it in Turtlebacks NEH for a while, but Breaking News can also do a lot of tricks. It's easier to close the game out with BN, and you can snipe resources if you sneak it out on the table for a turn (or SanSan).  I think it'd be better in some sort of glacier NBN where it'd be harder to trash the SanSan after you bring it back. Turtlebacks plays so light on ice that I felt it was just a mild tax on the runner when I scored a License Acquisition."

The reason's in your post:   potentially   The worst case scenario for the card is a blank 3/1 that significantly weakens your agenda suite (and scoring order). The best case scenario for the card isn't something game-breaking, it's 6 credits worth of value and a re-installed SanSan, which you cannot use until your next turn, assuming you fast advanced out the 3/1.  It's not going to stop Clot if you're AstroBiotics, and if you're not, there isn't much you want to re-install and rez that makes scoring this card particularly good value. In both cases it makes for a really dodgy scoring order, though."

PE, Argus, Midseasons, are the primary way to make this work. NEH and Gagarin also seem fine.  A few 3/1s seem to be valuable enough to include in agenda suites without other motive.

I think Director Haas' Pet Project is overrated. I have hope for that new Renovation Weyland has. That's about all I've got on 3/1s.  EDIT: BUH! Silly me. Genetic Resequencing is amazing!

Netrunner,3cwfy8,lordwei,6,Sat Jul 11 13:39:29 2015 UTC,"My first thought is that it's a pretty clear Celebrity Gift, and ICE HQ, (both Crick and Pup on HQ are fine here, actually), and that's fine, but I think there is good reason to consider another play:  Jackson Howard is pretty crucial here in allowing you to keep the pressure on the Runner, especially if you happen to draw into another agenda. Protecting him is kind of a big deal, and we can do it simply by icing centrals with the really annoying ICE we just drew. We also happened to have drawn a Hedge Fund, which can money us up in the short term. We can play Hedge, Pup Archives, Crick HQ, and the runner is almost sure to leave our centrals and our Jackson Howard alone, and assume Crick is on archives for the future, having seen it already. Next turn, we can Jackson to draw 2 once and Celebrity Gift leaving ourselves with 5 cards in hand, or keep it in reserve if we draw a MHC (playing it behind the Eli is a good way to salvage what is now a mediocre tax) or another Sundew (which we can protect with Tollbooth)."

Could you elaborate a bit more on this? While I get that Jackson will help you if you need to dump stuff from HQ, why is drawing especially important here? The reason I ask is mainly that I don't really have a firm grasp on when to draw as Corp."
Netrunner,3cwfy8,Calc3,2,Thu Jul 16 13:10:31 2015 UTC,"It's one of the more complicated things in the game, but it has to do with who is winning a projected long game if nothing much changes. The corp dictates the speed of the game mostly by how much they click to draw and how frequently they move to score agendas. When the corp wants the game to finish or progress to a later stage in their gameplan because the runner might gain some advantage in the late game, (a powerful rig and economy engine), clicking to draw is better. This is part of the reason why NEH's ability lends itself so well to rushy fast advance decks with cheap gear checking ICE, they pretty much always want the game to go faster because they don't really stand a chance once the runner is fully set-up outside of scoring out before the runner gets enough random accesses to win.  A Gabe or Leela deck might run out of steam if accesses get too expensive and the runner can't get in for a profitable account siphon, so against those runners, it might be a good idea just to ICE up and click for credits so you don't flood and give them a shot.  On the other hand, Noise is the sort of runner you want to hurry up against. The combination of Aesop's economy with a lot of cards is very strong, and the more he mills you and you Jackson agendas back in, the more agenda-dense your centrals get and the better shot he has of winning.  RP has an extremely strong midgame setup but can often come under fire late. Usually, against an average-speed runner like Kate or Andy, RP wants to be drawing early to get the ICE they want in the right places and put pressure on the runner by deploying Sundews. Drawing also finds you other economy cards and the pieces you need to score Nisei Mk II, which is the way you gain the edge in the late game against a fully set-up runner. Because you want to get drip econ online ASAP, (the more turns it's in play, the more money you get, and the earlier it comes out, the more painful it is for the runner to trash), RP wants to draw early against almost everything. The difficult to steal agendas help you do this without a huge risk of losing to flood, but Jackson Howard both accelerates your early-midgame drawing power and allows you to draw a lot more cards safely in case you don't find the pieces you're looking for soon. He can also be a pain to get to, as RP's ability and the threat of archives Crick mean that he might stay in play long after you've discarded unwanted agendas, which means you can continue to click to draw 2 and keep NAPDs and TFPs in archives where you won't draw them again until the runner forces you to use Jackson."

NBN+Haas Joint Venture: You may only use agendas from either ""NBN"" or ""Haas"" in this deck. If a card from NBN or Haas does not share faction with an agenda used in this deck it does not count towards influence.  The idea being that since this corp is neither straight NBN or Haas by default all factions would count towards influence. But by only including agendas of a one faction or the other you get to dip into the other factions card pool influence free.   So NBN agendas with mostly Haas cards or vice-versa. Or you could also try your hand at a mix of NBN agendas AND Hass agendas, but doing so would leave you with mostly neutral cards to build your deck from being that both corps would now count towards your influence total.

Netrunner,3cv2w0,rumirumirumirumi,0,Sat Jul 11 04:13:26 2015 UTC,"The real question is, why?  If you use cyber threat against a server where they can't rez ice, you're getting no benefit from it.  So you are investing the deckspace, influence, credits and action to .... Draw a card.  That seems highly inefficient.  Considering if you weren't playing cyber threat, you'd already have a different card so wouldn't need to draw...... Seems not good.  You also could have just left muertos untrashed and used a click to draw instead, and saved the credits, then trash muertos if they ever get everything rezzed."
Netrunner,3cv2w0,RestarttGaming,1 point,Sat Jul 11 02:23:37 2015 UTC,"But now you're making a run, and you get the benefit of Muertos Gang without the downside (plus a free draw if you're Geist). It's not the must powerful combo in the sprawl, but it does work."
Netrunner,3cv2w0,rumirumirumirumi,1 point,Sat Jul 11 12:40:18 2015 UTC,"right, but all you're doing is paying 1 credit and one card to draw one card.  generally thats not a good trade.  If they printed an event that cost one credit and said ""make a run against a server without any unrezzed ice.  Draw a card if you have a muertos gang member installed"", most people would consider that not worth playing.  Its usually better, unless you have all your muertos out already, to just save cyberthreat for it's original intention and draw cards normally than to use cyberthreat just to enable you to draw 1-2 cards (unless you're floating tags or something)"
Netrunner,3cv2w0,RestarttGaming,1 point,Sat Jul 11 13:13:03 2015 UTC,"But that's not what Cyber Threat says. The corp can't rez ice on that run, so you're getting a cheaper run than you wanted plus getting draw for free (no downside). Or the corp is rezzing an ice that you don't need to break. These have benefits beyond simply drawing a card, and you're making an argument ignoring those benefits."
Netrunner,3cv2w0,juliandark,1 point,Sat Jul 11 13:34:09 2015 UTC,"No, OP specifically said ""running a server with no ice or no unrezzed ice"".

You are spending a credit, a card and a click to ask the corp ""if I run here, will you rezz any ICE?"" and unless they were hoping to punish you for facechecking it's the same as if you just run there, saving a credit and a card."

Netrunner,3cv2w0,RestarttGaming,1 point,Sat Jul 11 02:28:12 2015 UTC,"Cyber threat doesn't de-rez.  If you notice i was fine with playing Muertos gang member.  It's playing Cyber threat, especially against a server the corp can't rez ice on, that is the problem.  I get that OP's goal probably was - ok so i'm already playing Muertos gang member.  How can i trash him for a card without the corp getting a rez?  And even if that wasn't your goal, this is a legitimate question if you're already playing cyber threat for some reason (i wont judge) and muertos and you didn't specifically play them for the combo, but it came up.  But combo-ing with cyber threat just isn't the answer if you're not already playing both cards for themselves and would be playing them without the ""combo"".  And most of the time you'll want to use cyberthreat for .... whyever you included it in the first place, and only use it as a last resort when you have multiple muertos out.  Here's why:  Cyberthreat +meurtos is basically spending 1 credit and a card to draw a card (assuming you already want to run on the server in question first click, otherwise it's way worse).  If you notice, you'll end up with the same number of cards, so basically you're paying a credit to go through your deck one card faster.  Cyber threat is doing NOTHING that run but enabling .... replacing itself with another card.  But i've had worse and other cards do this WAY better.  I've had worse is paying one credit and a card for THREE cards, and has a cool alternate effect.  To even break even with what i've had worse can do anytime, you need a best case scenario, you have to assemble a combo of A)1 cyber threat B)the corp has a server they can't rez ice on C)you already want to run first click D) 3 muertos are in play E) the corp has no assets or upgrades to rez and then and only then do you BREAK EVEN with I've had worse (you're actually still slightly worse because, while you get to run for free, your other two Cyber threats are not very useful now, so you've created two almost dead cards).  So it's a big combo and specific setup to do what another card already does better without requiring that setup.  If you're not already playing cyber threat, you can just not include cyber threat, and you'll already have a different card instead of cyberthreat, no need to spend a credit to replace it.  I get wanting to make the meurtos draw happen without the rez downside, but in 99.9% of situations it'll be better to just click to draw unless you absolutely need the free draw or the rez wont matter or everythings already rezzed.  If you've got a cyber threat, it's original use you included it for is probably FAR better than trying to meet the 5 conditions it takes for it to be almost an I've had worse, especially when you'll probably be almost as efficient just drawing.  So, in summary - this is a legitimate rules question that may come up, and it was good that it was asked and answered - but please no one try building around it."
Netrunner,3cv2w0,Kandiru,1 point,Sat Jul 11 02:51:47 2015 UTC,"I am confused by the Huge answer that you just gave.  Not by anything you said like I understand the rules, but I don't understand why you felt the need to make such a huge reply to what I said.  Every time I play A reina deck and i built my own reina deck people use effects that derez cards.  Emergency shutdown requires an hq run, cresenteus requires you to break the ice your derezing and mgm doesnt let you choose, plus it has the free rez downside, if you're specifically planning to play that kind of deck mgm could be good to pack in more of that effect,  and forge activation orders and cyber threat also both see a lot of play in Reina  In short I'm pretty sure he was planning to use them both already, and now that it seems that cyber threat does prevent MGM from rezing ice for free I'm going to throw that together and try it"
Netrunner,3cv2w0,dlcnate1,1 point,Sat Jul 11 04:15:04 2015 UTC,"The point wasn't that the cards don't see play ( though cyber threat rarely does at any high level tournament), the point was the cards are better used separately, since cyber threat can't be used for its original purpose if your using it to draw a card.  It's the fact even when played together, they're usually better used separate than in a combo"
Netrunner,3cv2w0,RestarttGaming,1 point,Sat Jul 11 04:18:13 2015 UTC,"I think the combo is really that you were worried about being Midseasons and having the MGM trashed getting them a free archer, say. If you dispose of it during a Cyberthreat, then that isn't a risk.  Not saying it's great, just that it's a way to safely remove the gang member."

Netrunner,3cv2w0,rumirumirumirumi,0,Sat Jul 11 11:28:54 2015 UTC,"I think you're misunderstanding, or maybe miscommunicating. You still are making a run that the corp can't rez ice on, so you're still using Cyber Threat as it is meant to be used on its own. You're also using Meurtos Gang Member to derez a card. But now you're trashing MGM during the CT run to exploit the no rez situation to get the benefit without the drawback. You're still making a run and still getting the benefit of all your cards, plus the extra benefit if using them together.  In your case against MGM+CT, you're resorting to denigrating the cards by ignoring their useful effects and assuming the runner is playing CT for no reason other than to avoid MGM's uninstall trigger and for no other reason but to draw a card."
Netrunner,3cv2w0,RestarttGaming,0,Sat Jul 11 12:50:41 2015 UTC,"I think you actually might be misunderstanding instead, or at least not recalling the whole conversation.  Remember, the original question wasn't about using Cyberthreat in a way it's normally used and then you happen to use muertos.  I've said in my previous post that's fine.  The original question was about using cyber threat against a normal server with no unrezzed ice or anything special (which normally is just a waste of a credit and card as it wouldn't do anything) for the express purpose of using muertos gang member.     My question is, can I play Cyber Threat, targetting a server with no unrezzed ice (or no ice at all), then during that run trash Muertos to prevent the corp from getting their free rez?   The point of Cyber threat is to either force the corp to rez ice on one server so they dont have the cash to rez it on the one you ACTUALLY want to run, or to check if the corp can rez a piece of ice if you're afraid of what they might rez.  Theres no reason to play cyber threat on a server with no unrezzed ice under any normal circumstance.   So you're using that card for no purpose other than to enable you to use the trash ability of muertos.  you would NEVER normally use cyber threat like that (running a server without any unrezzed ice) without muertos gang member (or another specialty card, like for some reason the corp might have a rezzed but not trashed howler or something, but the point is in normal play, with the absence of other conditions)  Now, if you were using Cyber Threat for a normal use, and they just elected not to rez, yeah, you might as well pop muertos gang member.  This is perfectly fine, as i stated in my previous post     this is a legitimate question if you're already playing cyber threat for some reason (i wont judge) and muertos and you didn't specifically play them for the combo, but it came up   So in summary - you're using Cyberthreat normally and muertos normally and the corp happens to not rez for one of the cyber threats?  great, pop them muertos.  But playing Cyberthreat specifically to allow you to trigger 1-2 muertos (without other factors like Giest or you're floating tags) is usually a very inefficient use of cyberthreat.  Which was also in my previous post     So, in summary - this is a legitimate rules question that may come up, and it was good that it was asked and answered - but please no one try building around it."
Netrunner,3cv2w0,RestarttGaming,1 point,Sat Jul 11 13:31:47 2015 UTC,"The original question wasn't the question you were answering with these walls of text, and so I guess this is a matter of people talking past each other.  I liked your more concise answer to the OP you posted earlier though."
Netrunner,3cv2w0,rumirumirumirumi,1 point,Sat Jul 11 13:37:20 2015 UTC,"Thank you, the original post was the rules answer.  This cluster/thread was addressing the fact that though the rules are technically as OP asked, they should be careful to not just play it for that, as though that technically works, it's usually not worth it.  If those cards are included for just that purpose, it's better without cyberthreat, and if they're being played for other purposes, it's usuallybetter for those other purposes.   I wanted to make it two separate posts because one is a rules answer about what is strictly possible, and one is a opinion piece about what's good, and those have pretty different purposes and should get muddled or confused.    You see, the original question was indeed the one i was answering in the walls of text.  You can tell this because i restated in pretty much each individual post that the problem is specifially playing cyberthreat against a server without unrezzed ice.    My original post in this threat started with     The real question is, why? If you use cyber threat against a server where they can't rez ice, ...   The next comment was about how someone thought the op wanted to use it to just negate the downside of MGM  To which i responded with a post that stated, several times in several different wordings, that it can be a legitimate question that can come up if you're legitimately playing each card for their intended purpose, but playing it for just that combo is usually not good or efficient.  Then you posted your concern that, despite though every post above it in the thread all the way back to OP referenced just using the combo to get around muertos's downside, that maybe that wasn't what i was talking about.  So I thought i made it pretty clear thats what i was talking about, as i explicitly put it in every post.  But apparently its still unclear, as you thought that when i said i was talking about OP's case of using Cyberthreat on a server where ice can't be rezzed, that maybe i was actually meant that i wasn't talking about that, and was instead talking about using cyberthreat in one of it's normal uses."

From the Timing Structure of a Run:  2.3. Approached ICE can be rezzed     Paid ability can be used     cards can be rezzed. 2.4. Check if ICE is rezzed.     If rezzed, goto 3.      If unrezzed, and there's another piece of ICE, goto 2.     If unrezzed, and there's no more ICE, go to 4. 3. Runner Encounters Ice if rezzed.   Ice gets rezzed during 2.3.  Since it's a paid ability window, the runner can also use clone chip here.  Before the ice is ever actually encountered.  It has nothing to do with priority in resolving effects - it's a simple case of ""Quicksand doesn't grow until it is encountered, but there is a window BEFORE it is encountered, but after it is rezzed, in which it can be parasited.""

Netrunner,3cuw38,xxayn,5,Sat Jul 11 07:01:51 2015 UTC,"It is slightly better early because for 1 less credit, the corp can still lock the runner out. Later, Atman at 4 is very common and gets through Bastion for 1 credit. So, Wall of Static stays under the Atman threshold and still taxes Corroder more than say, Himitsu-Bako, or Ice Wall.   If you notice that you have no (or maybe only 1-2) strength 4 ice for some reason, then including Bastion is a great idea."

Also, in the kate/shaper matchup, they both tax 1 lady counter - the extra credit to boost is largely irrelevant. You're better off putting that rez credit toward another barrier to tax more counters."

Netrunner,3cuw38,neutronicus,1 point,Fri Jul 10 23:50:32 2015 UTC,"I didn't think you included it as a tax. It's just Bastion increases the cost to play and break by 1, so if they ever break it, it's worth it.   The answer provided by /u/thecupboardman is what I suspect to be the correct answer."
Netrunner,3cuw38,Lowsow,2,Sat Jul 11 00:23:14 2015 UTC,"I kind of agree. The extra credit isn't huge. Most of the time, that is. But early game, 1 credit can be fairly significant. If you play Bastion, just start counting the times swapping it for Wall of Static would enable a slightly faster turn 1 or turn 3 line of play. For me that happens decently often, so I choose Wall of Static. Of course, the resilience to Atman 4 is also a nice bonus."

Netrunner,3cukci,eulennatzer,3,Sat Jul 11 00:22:24 2015 UTC,"I feel like you might have missed the announcement. They confirmed a while ago that when the first pack of the 8th cycle (expected Spring 2017, will likely be later with delays. We're mostly through the 4th now and the 5th should start late 2015) is released Genesis and Spin will rotate out.   https://www.fantasyflightgames.com/en/news/2014/11/5/when-new-programs-overwrite-the-old/  While it's possible they might reverse this decision there's no indication that they will currently so I don't think it's unlikely that rotation isn't going to happen. But either way there's still at least two years where Spin and Genesis will be legal, two years to build my tomb for Jackson Howard to be enshrined within."
Netrunner,3cukci,grimwalker,2,Sat Jul 11 00:57:30 2015 UTC,"As people have said, the first two cycles have at least 2 years until end of life. But, that said, you're well within your rights to only buy what you want to use. That's the beauty of an LCG system--you know what is in which packs, so you can afford to be choosy."
Netrunner,3cukci,eulennatzer,1 point,Sat Jul 11 14:06:01 2015 UTC,"First of all rotation is still hears ahead.  Second of all even if they announced the rotation and its details, isn't there still a somewhat small chance they might even chance their minds in any form?  Also there are some crucial cards in the first cycles that probably will be played until the last days."

Netrunner,3cukci,grimwalker,1 point,Sat Jul 11 15:31:44 2015 UTC,"The thing is, they have said that rotated sets will be left to go out of print. Sponsoring any sort of Legacy format creates a situation where rarity matters and an aftermarket would be the only place to obtain pricey OOP cards. That goes against the core philosophy of the LCG model: everything is available, everyone is on a level playing field."
Netrunner,3cukci,grimwalker,1 point,Sun Jul 12 16:25:18 2015 UTC,"That's a fair point. Still, I'd consider buying the first two cycles a good idea for anyone getting into the game at this point, less so maybe once we are past the Mumbad cycle, but maybe they are less of a priority than they were."
Netrunner,3ct176,nelsormensch,15,Fri Jul 10 15:17:46 2015 UTC,"I've been waiting for this thread. Faust is an incredible card for a bunch of reasons:  DOUBLE ECON BOOGALOO: Cards as econ has been explored before, but never to this extent. Faust makes Diesel a more versatile Easy Mark, and Quality Time a slightly more expensive Sure Gamble. This doesn't sound amazing on paper, but cards are better than just taking credits. Cards give you options. Cards make you more money. Cards win you the game, and Faust likes cards.  CLOSING SCORING WINDOWS: Faust completely ruins the current notion of the scoring window because your cards in hand are significantly less predictable than your credit pool. Cards like Game Day are incredible because they let you run scoring servers back to back.   An example: I played against a NEXT Design deck the other day. My opponent threw a two pointer in a 4 deep remote and I stole it with Faust/e3, bringing my hand quite low and reducing my credit pool a bit. He still had money, so he figured he had a perfect window to score a different agenda.  Suddenly, GAME DAY BOYS WOO SPORTSBALL WOO  EFFICIENCY LIKE WHAT: So you're going to toss loads of your cards in the bin. That's expected. Sometimes a particularly nasty server will take a few more cards than you expected, but for the most part Faust allows you to adjust your hand to your current needs. Toss in some Clone Chips, Same Old Thing, etc, and your bin is basically a second hand. Then when you need to play all of your econ events again, just Levy.  IDIOT-PROOF: You can make your Faust deck as simple or complicated to operate as you want. A few public sympathies and some card draw can be enough to turn Faust on with a supplementary breaker or two. You can focus more on Faust with Wyldsyde/Pancakes, which you might already be running. You can go a bit more janky and run Pancakes/Starlight for stupid amounts of money and draw, or fully embrace the jank and actually play Duggars in a deck!  The point of my ramblings is that Faust is a legitimately good AI breaker. Its costs are on par with Eater (albeit in its own way) and it allows accesses. Watch for this card, folks."
Netrunner,3ct176,Vysetron,13,Fri Jul 10 17:19:51 2015 UTC,"Can I use Faust outside of runs?  I remember it coming up in discussions of Nasir that you can at least pump icebreaker strength during runs but outside of encounters, but can you do it outside of runs?  A real use for this would be: You have Clone Chip in play and Clot in your grip. Corp checks there's no Clot in the Heap. Corp tries to fast advance an agenda. You trash Clot with Faust, and Clone Chip it."
Netrunner,3ct176,flamingtominohead,11,Fri Jul 10 15:31:25 2015 UTC,"Yes, you can boost strength during any paid ability window. You just can't break subroutines outside of an encounter."

It gives you tags which negates the best draw engine for Faust, Wyld Pancakes. It gives you money, which isn't useful for fueling Faust. Why not just play Eater if you're going that route?  I think Faust does best with Vamp, Wanton Destruction, and Eater."
Netrunner,3ct176,llama66613,1 point,Sat Jul 11 07:46:45 2015 UTC,"i would remove stimhack here. it really doesn't synergize with your breaker suite (doesnt help faust,mimic or yog), and the brain damage will kill faust in the long run. I would also run 3 faust (you can always pitch extra copies to faust). Also cyberfeeder is a waste of a card slot, as you won't get a whole lot of econ engine out of it in this deck. I would replace it with kati jones.  other than that, love the deck."
Netrunner,3ct176,mmc31,1 point,Sat Jul 11 13:21:10 2015 UTC,"It's amazing, but it comes very costly (in either setup or cards) unless those runs are very effective. As in, you need multiaccess, Siphon, etc."
Netrunner,3ct176,flamingtominohead,4,Fri Jul 10 16:41:47 2015 UTC,"The one nice difference i've seen in this case is that you're likely going to be running a draw engine anyways to power faust, and that makes the setup a LOT easier as you'll be planning your space for it anyways.    Normally if you run some absurd draw engine it starts to become dead at some point because you've already got your rig, but with faust your extra draw becomes fuel to break.  Granted this is speaking from the corp side of the table, and my opponent was extremely cash strapped, but I  think it can be done."

Netrunner,3ct176,JohnQK,1 point,Fri Jul 10 16:45:39 2015 UTC,"There are two decent uses for this card. The first is an early game, emergency hop over cheap ice when the corp is trying to rush. I don't see it getting used too much this way, but it's something.  The second is to build an entire deck around it, similar to how other breakers are built around (Eater, Sage, etc). A ton of draw, especially passive draw, combined with a large handsize, E3, and maybe D4v1d to deal with giant ice. I can see this being used pretty well."

Netrunner,3ct176,xxayn,1 point,Fri Jul 10 18:51:35 2015 UTC,"I tried it at my local store a couple nights ago. My thought was Maxx + Wyldside/pancakes + vigil = potentially 4 draws every turn.   It worked better than I expected, but not great. Main problem is the setup still takes a while. And you need money to set it up, trash stuff, steal NAPD, fight Ash, etc, so you can't really skimp on econ.   Vigil almost never triggered, corps always played around it. I guess even with 3 cards coming in a turn they still didn't want to give me one more.  Those 3/4 cards also go away pretty quickly when you start breaking ice with them - I was rarely making more than one run a turn where I actually broke ice with faust. This kind of conflicts with what I see as anarchs ultimate goal - tear down the worst of the ice and run everywhere.  The idea didn't really seem optimal to me. Maybe I'm just too much of a rig builder though - when I draw into good stuff like parasite/datasucker/clone chip/liberated, my first instinct is to throw it down rather than feed everything to faust.  I did find faust as a breaker intriguing, and I definitely prefer it to eater. It seems like anarch's best in-faction answer to lotus field (although i imagine NRE/atman will still be common splashes). It wasn't something I was initially excited by in this pack, but now I'm looking forward to trying it out in other setups."

Netrunner,3ctmey,SonofSonofSpock,28,Fri Jul 10 17:57:08 2015 UTC,"The thing that I think would make BWBI better is making the click to advance a card free, rather than the credit (since I always felt that was the bigger cost for ever-rich Weyland); for example:   1credit: place 1 advancement counter on an installed piece of ice; use this ability only once per turn, and only on your turn.   The side benefit of this wording is that it could be used to advance ice that cannot normally be advanced, which could make ice such as Woodcutter and Tyrant more usable.    GRNDL could really have been a 40 card ID, making it a better ID for the ""supermodernism"" idea.  *edit: I've personally tried using a supermodernism style of weyland in building a better world using the clearences, and found it to be quite effective, *    Gagarin doesn't need changing, it just needs there to be more good Weyland assets (and ambushes)"

Weyland has no real fast advance build, your ice costs you credits while not harming the runner at all.

Blue Sun is so strong, because you don't loose all your credits from rezzing etr. ice and the runner just ignoring it which means he does not loose credits, too.

Or maybe it blows up a piece of advanced (doesn't matter if it's rezed or not) ice and transfers the counters around for free?  I see the main issue is the limit on number of times it can be used on a run. It should be usable while the runner is running, but maybe not making it horribly painful on every step of every turn?  What if it only works by transferring to the outermost piece of Ice?   So it can only be useful once a run?  It would still make it capable of giving a runner pause or slow their pace down, it lets Wayland be dynamic, but it can get very expensive, and where you shift the Advancements around can be useful in a bluff.  It could also work by maybe making click-debt a thing? It costs a click of your next turn to move the counters around? Or it could require spending a click to have active until your next turn?

Netrunner,3ctmey,PaxCecilia,1 point,Sat Jul 11 05:26:32 2015 UTC,Doesn't matter if you have a good agenda if there is no reliable way to protect it.
Netrunner,3ctmey,nialbima,10,Mon Jul 20 12:30:45 2015 UTC,"Weyland core set could be brought back into relevance with a few transactions that not only synergize with having an operation based economy, but maintain and accelerate tempo. As nice as it is to have cash on demand with operations, sometimes you're getting bogged down with clicks. Say something like:  2c - Weyland - Operation Transaction Gain 4c and install a card. If the installed card is Ice, place an advancement token on it.  Maybe that's busted, I don't know, I'm not a designer. I just know that playing operation economy tends to not leave enough clicks to do other good things on your turn. When I play HB I put out an Adonis behind a bioroid and I'll be flush with cash to do whatever I want for a few turns. In Weyland I am struggling to maintain economy and board presence. Something along those lines would help."
Netrunner,3ctmey,PaxCecilia,7,Fri Jul 10 18:34:10 2015 UTC,"Also, we haven't gotten any transactions in a WHILE. The last one was Paywall. Medical Research Fundraiser and Diversified portfolio are a little weird in BABW, and Blue Level takes a chunk of influence. The last one we saw that's of use to core Weyland is Restructure, so there hasn't been much of a reason to do core Weyland in like two years (BLC is probably good, I don't play core). So the ID just isn't super relevant right now."
Netrunner,3ctmey,nialbima,3,Fri Jul 10 19:07:14 2015 UTC,"That's true, and I would argue none of Paywall Implementation, Medical Research Fundraiser or Diversified Portfolio are wanted in BABW. Paywall is better for letting them into servers, which weyland doesn't have great traps to capitalize on with. MRF gives the runner money, which isn't good since most of Weyland's ice is end the run. Finally, Diversified Portfolio makes no sense at all with an operation economy.  Blue Level Clearance is actually pretty solid IMO, filling your hand back up after playing a ton of operations and Ice is useful and 4c + 2cards for 2 clicks is pretty efficient."
Netrunner,3ctmey,PaxCecilia,1 point,Fri Jul 10 19:13:37 2015 UTC,"Yeah, if I were building BABW I think I'd run at least 2, depending on INF.  Paywall's surprisingly strong. I run it in Argus and it's defensive Desperado. I agree it probably doesn't do much for BABW, but that card is fuuuuuun."
Netrunner,3ctmey,ChainnChomp,3,Fri Jul 10 20:11:17 2015 UTC,IMO it's best in Gagarin. Very fun in Gagarin :)
Netrunner,3ctmey,nialbima,2,Fri Jul 10 20:12:03 2015 UTC,"Seriously, having the runner check a remote while you have Paywall and Pop-Up in front of it is a huge 4 credit swing."
Netrunner,3ctmey,ChainnChomp,1 point,Fri Jul 10 20:24:56 2015 UTC,But then they don't run remotes. Only getting that swing on score was why I switched to Argus.  Could be I should've been running Sundew.
Netrunner,3ctmey,nialbima,1 point,Fri Jul 10 20:58:47 2015 UTC,"Exactly. The first time they hit it, there is a four credit swing right away and even more if they trash an asset in the remote. Then you put valuable assets in that remote. The Root, Sundew, Adonis Campaign, etc. You can rest assured that there is a heavy deterrent to running it and, if it is run, the game is going to experience a good sized credit shift in doing it and all you had to do was place a single Pop-Up Window in front of your asset.  Of course, I say this with the consideration that I'm running a Gagarin deck with 6 agendas, 2 Junebugs, and Punitives. I'm not trying to score those agendas and, in my goal to Punitive my opponent, any shift in credits that is in my favor is a great one."
Netrunner,3ctmey,RogueCarpet,1 point,Sat Jul 11 00:23:44 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's where I got into the card, but it's really good with Argus. There are some matchups where it just does nothing (what's up Noise), but in most others it can fuel the entire game. If they steal, it's a Beanstalk or 2 meat damage. If they don't, it's Desperado."
Netrunner,3ctmey,Calc3,10,Fri Jul 10 20:43:28 2015 UTC,"Core Set: Whenever you play a transaction operation or rez a transaction asset, gain 1 credit.    This affects Marked Accounts, Security Subcontract, and Private Contracts. Not a huge buff, but at least expands the scope of the ID. Core Weyland hasn't gotten card support in ages, and this at least gives the designers more options.   BWBI: At the start of your turn, you may place an advancement token an installed piece of ICE that can be advanced.    Removes the click cost from the advancing.   GRNDL: 40/12 deck.   This creates a nice cycle with TWIY, Harmony Medtech, GRNDL, and NEXT Design as 40/12 rush decks.*   Titan: Make Atlas never rotate out. :P  * Edit: NEXT is 45/12, not 40/12. Sad news for symmetry."
Netrunner,3ctmey,MrSmith2,10,Fri Jul 10 19:44:12 2015 UTC,"I think the issue with Weyland is more the lack of cohesion of the cards than the IDs. I would like to see a protection upgrade that can be advanced to be more powerful for BWBI, Subliminal Messaging as a Transaction for BABW, and an agenda that rewards you for having BP for GRNDL."
Netrunner,3ctmey,Bwob,2,Fri Jul 10 21:27:38 2015 UTC,"This. Weyland IDs have seen very little in the way of good synergistic cards: For BABW there are exactly 3 in-faction Transaction Operations. That's crap, especially given one is a current, one depends on advancable ice and the other is Beanstalk. For BWBI there's been some attempts - 3 sets of advanacable ice have been made, but most are best used as examples of why Weyland ice isn't good. ""Advance only when rezzed"" is cumbersome, under-strength and does nothing the first time the runner encounters it. ""Morph"" was slightly better - Wendigo was the first suggestion Weyland might not always suck at code gates, Changeling isn't awful, though atman at 4 runs right over it, but Lycan is terrible. With the Cosmic ice and the Constellation Protocol things are a bit better, but it took a lot of false starts to get here. For GRNDL there was a chance to let Weyland just be bad guys - no morals, no subtlety - but the only BP mitigating card we've seen is the eminently yogable Ireress. Some more in this vein would have been nice, but thus far it's been completely ignored."
Netrunner,3ctmey,ErikTwice,1 point,Sat Jul 11 07:00:03 2015 UTC,"For BABW there are exactly 3 in-faction Transaction Operations. That's crap, especially given one is a current, one depends on advancable ice and the other is Beanstalk.   That's technically true, but a little disingenuous, since there are also 3 neutral transaction operations - Hedge Fund, Restructure, and Diversified Portfolio.  The fact that they're neutral doesn't make them any less weyland's - they're still cards that can be put in to any weyland deck for 0 influence.  (And there are a bunch more out-of-faction transactions while still having some influence left to play with.)"
Netrunner,3ctmey,RepoRogue,5,Sat Jul 11 07:10:15 2015 UTC,"I think Weyland simply has a flawed card pool, his actual identities are (generally) quite solid and diverse, there's simply not enough cards to make them shine.  For example, consider how shaky Weyland's economy is. You cannot spam assets other than PAD Campaign, your playstyle is too expensive for the handful of operations available and you have practically nothing in faction that forces a run to keep the Runner poor. It's no wonder people play Blue Sun, it's the only identity that can bypass this huge issue.  In fact, I built a Blue Sun deck the other day and it's whole design is very telling: Blue Sun, eight influence on Caprice because Weyland has no good upgrades, and 3 Hostile Takeovers without Archer and some BP removal thrown in because I need both the bluff and the money.  The fact that Weyland has good, but non-punishing ICE only compounds the issue but when it comes down to it, I can just boil it down to two problems:  1) Weyland cannot a force a remote run. 2) Weyland doesn't have the economy to win a game without forcing the Runner to run its remote.  Also, Weyland suffers a lot more than any other faction by having to spend influence on Jackson."
Netrunner,3ctmey,Glitch29,1 point,Fri Jul 10 22:35:38 2015 UTC,"I agree with your two points, but I'd like to point out that the public agendas are at least an attempt to remedy that. Oaktown is perfect in that role: it allows you to threaten to click for nine credits in a turn if the runner doesn't run it fast. If they run it, then they risk getting blown up, and if they leave it, then they make it much harder to run in the future without being blown to pieces.  The big issue with what I just described is that Weyland, outside of Blue Sun, has such poor economy that it's very hard to threaten the kill early enough for that play to be effective."
Netrunner,3ctmey,nista002,1 point,Sat Jul 11 05:33:25 2015 UTC,"I wrote a pretty long post that ended up being eaten but it came to pretty much this conclusion.  Weyland has some incredibly powerful, unique, game-warping effects. Things way bigger and swingier than anything the other corps are doing. FFG pretty much had to give Weyland an incomplete card pool to balance this out, which to their credit they did.   As it is, players can choose Weyland and get a lot of powerful cards, but have decks which are squeezed on the fundamentals. Or they can run other corps with better 3/2s, trickier ICE, shell games, and taxing assets, but have limited/zero access to heavy hitters like Scorched Earth, Oversight AI, High-Risk Investment, and Archer.  This is all well-and-good, but a lot of Weylands IDs don't mesh with the absurdity of the card pool. Titan rewards scoring agendas, but it's impossible to form coherent strategy around that when Weyland has comparatively little control over what's scored or stolen. Garagin would work well with assets, shell games, and cheap ICE, but there's no built-in support for that. Argus, while on-point flavor-wise, works with an equally unsupported taxing strategy.  What FFG did do well was BABW, which embraces Weyland's ""big"" theme.  ""Tricky"" and ""Weyland"" are usually mutually exclusive concepts, but Blue Sun does a great job of providing the chance to be deceptive while still using the epic and over-the-top cards that define the faction as a whole.  GRNDL would have been a good design had the card not been woefully underpowered. Being able to threaten Janus on T1 or put on a lot of early-game Midseasons pressure both would open up the gamespace.  Ultimately, I think every Weyland ID needs to do something game-altering. The cardbase is just too out-of-whack to work without an ID that makes the game different, too."
Netrunner,3ctmey,nettu,5,Sat Jul 11 13:38:40 2015 UTC,"Gagarin would have been much better if it required an extra cred to access each card out of centrals, instead of anything to do with remotes.  And BABW would be heavily played today if Subliminal Messaging had been a transaction. RP would be nowhere near as powerful if it didn't have Sundew as a basically ID specific econ card. Weyland version of Sundew would be excellent.  But Weyland's ID's aren't the problem. It all the other cards in Weyland that suck."
Netrunner,3ctmey,Wakks,3,Sat Jul 11 01:44:37 2015 UTC,Weyland just doesn't have good efficient ice like the other corps. Weyland could also benefit from some good in faction assets/upgrades.
Netrunner,3ctmey,RepoRogue,2,Fri Jul 10 19:10:43 2015 UTC,Sounds like a job for influence. Good destroyers and taxing ice exist and Weyland has the cash to support it. See Quinns's splashes in his London Gagarin deck. Cortex Lock and Architect for ice you don't want to run into and Raven for tag pressure.
Netrunner,3ctmey,JohnQK,2,Fri Jul 10 19:49:02 2015 UTC,"Let's look at what Weyland has to splash for: Jackson Howard, (practically mandatory) decent ice, (not mandatory, but highly desirable) econ, (unless you're playing Blue Sun, and sometimes even then) tagging, and glacier supporting upgrades. That is too long of a list, and every Weyland deck suffers significantly from having to ignore one or more item from it. That is the basic reason Weyland is largely uncompetitive, except for Blue Sun, and even then, it's borderline."
Netrunner,3ctmey,Bwob,3,Sat Jul 11 05:36:59 2015 UTC,"The only Weyland ID that I think needs a ""fix"" would be Because We Built It. I think the way to fix it would be to have that free ice-advancement not cost a click. Just say ""once per turn, you may place an advancement token on a piece of Ice that can be advanced"" or something like that.   A little strong? Sure, with the right deck. But even with that I don't think I'll see it used much."
Netrunner,3ctmey,JohnQK,1 point,Fri Jul 10 19:55:57 2015 UTC,You don't think that having ice/firewalls grow forever for free wouldn't be a little strong?
Netrunner,3ctmey,Bwob,1 point,Sat Jul 11 07:13:54 2015 UTC,"If they devoted their free advancement to one for the entire game it would probably get to be pretty gigantic, but there are enough forms of ice destruction to compensate for it."
Netrunner,3ctmey,pimpbot,0,Sat Jul 11 15:07:42 2015 UTC,"Really?  The only real ways I think you'd be able to counter it are Femme, David, or Knifed.  Immolation Script is too hit-or-miss, and good luck parasiting something that grows as fast as parasite gains counters...  And of course, nothing says you have to stick all the counters on just one ice - if you have x3 ice walls and x3 fire walls (which you would), you'd just spread the tokens around.  (And we haven't even gotten into advancing space ice, were this ability would effectively be ""gain 3 credits at the start of your turn"")"
Netrunner,3ctmey,nialbima,3,Sat Jul 11 18:00:35 2015 UTC,"Given the way that card power inter-relates to the other cards in the metapool, this is actually a very complex question. I'm actually partial to Willingdone's recent analysis wherein he argues that the existence of Parasite and Datasucker (in their current form, especially the low inf) is a huge limiting factor on the viability of a ton of other cards in the card pool, including in this case a crapton of what would otherwise be decent and playable Weyland ICE."
Netrunner,3ctmey,McCaber,3,Fri Jul 10 20:51:31 2015 UTC,"RE: Argus, I think turning it into a softer PE would be a huge mistake. That ID relies on scoring anything being a source of stress for the runner as a way to open windows or kill them (which I guess was the idea behind Supermodernism, but Argus defends itself well and Oaktown is really strong)."
Netrunner,3ctmey,Xercies_jday,2,Fri Jul 10 21:10:29 2015 UTC,Cut Grendel down to a 40/10.
Netrunner,3ctmey,zagzagal,2,Fri Jul 10 18:22:41 2015 UTC,I think all those terrible advancable ice we got in the genesis cycle did a bit of damage to the corporation. Basically we got quite a few cards that no one uses because they are really bad and thats a lot of the card pool for the faction taken away. Maybe if they had made the kind of advancable ice in o&c from the start the card pool would be a lot more healthier.
Netrunner,3ctmey,RepoRogue,2,Fri Jul 10 23:29:32 2015 UTC,"I agree with others that the biggest problem Weyland has right now is the drek that they got given in a couple of cycles. The advance only after rez ice have been a complete failure. The power counter theme was a wash. The death of a 1000 bullets got killed with little in faction tagging ability, which is understandable no one wants scorch to be too easy. Of course the biggest problem is the death of archer and other destroyers as people no longer care what the unrezed ice is thanks to fairy and sharpshooter.  That said the problem looks to be resolving itself. The big W has gotten a very good agenda in Oaktown Renovations. Good hate in the form of Corporate Town (god I love this card), and student loans. Playable ice in the form of Meru Mati and Spiderweb.  They are only an answer for datasucker away from being a very good faction."
Netrunner,3ctmey,zagzagal,1 point,Sat Jul 11 02:19:50 2015 UTC,Power Shutdown. Power Shutdown is the answer to Data Sucker and so many other things.
Netrunner,3ctmey,RestarttGaming,2,Sat Jul 11 05:39:28 2015 UTC,"You know I played a whole regional and never hit a data sucker with Power Shutdown, then again I never saw a Data Sucker with more than one token except when it was looking real sad against an Archer.  Now it is the best answer for fairy, or Net ready. Only I feel that the window for power shutdown doesn't hit right for a supermodernism style deck, of which I was not playing.  I was thinking more about an actual virus hate card, in the blacklist/Corporate Town/Student Loans mold."
Netrunner,3ctmey,Quarg,4,Sat Jul 11 06:03:51 2015 UTC,"Or, you could just tone down blue sun a bit.  I dont think it's that the other Weyland ID's are so far underpowered.  They actually seem to be pretty decently competitive with one another.  The issue seems to be the famous ""better in kate"" issue, where most shaper decks are just better if you swap the runner out with kate, unless you're working on a super thematic deck going all in on one idea. if you're going to play weyland, you have to have a HECK of a reason not to play blue sun, because most of the time it's just better."
Netrunner,3ctmey,chrsjxn,4,Fri Jul 10 18:03:18 2015 UTC,"I think the issue is more that Blue Sun is the only Weyland ID that is currently competitive overall.  I really like Weyland as a faction, but before Blue Sun especially they were a complete non factor in competitive play (I started playing a little before honor and profit came out)."
Netrunner,3ctmey,Gammaran,2,Fri Jul 10 18:19:10 2015 UTC,"I agree fully;  Kate, Blue Sun, ETF and NEH are all IDs that I think are past the border of OP; it's just a shame that Kate and ETF won't ever cycle out; rendering any other IDs of those factions nigh useless unless it has a similarly OP (or abusable) ID ability."
Netrunner,3ctmey,ChosinBasin,3,Fri Jul 10 18:16:38 2015 UTC,"The funny thing here is that only Blue Sun has an ""interesting"" ability from your list.  Kate and ETF are both: play a card, get a credit. NEH is: play a card, get a card (with 2 extra influence)."

That way they can make a robust deck of ice, but cant default to the easy tag and bag because most of those cards are on NBN. Also not being able to take Jackson Howard and your opponent knowing that from turn 1 is payment enough for the extra influence"

Reasons:  If they run on HQ and R&D you'll be able to rez both and still have money for a PSI game if there is a Future Perfect on top.  Eli on HQ is win-win. Either it's an ETR and your Nisei Mk2 is safe. Or they'll click through for 50% a costly trash or a 25% score.  Pup is good enough on R&D to stall them long enough. for you to beef up the defenses there.  Next turn you can begin power drawing with Jacko to get an economy server with that Sundew. Also, plug Archives so they don't get free Dirty Laundries there. HQ needs spiky ice on top so they can't bounce. R&D needs beefy ice.  Edit: Forgot the Tollbooth"

As an alternative, though, how about click 1 draw? That leaves you with a 14% chance of seeing a non-NAPD agenda, which would suck, but some 77% of the time you'll be left with a more secure HQ.

Playing it now as opposed to next turn nets you 2 credits, which is a big deal. The way to beat Kate is with remote pressure; if she is allowed to set up at her own speed, she is favored. If she's digging for SMC or something, you're in good shape. You're happy to give up random accesses as RP, so icing centrals is bottom priority. Icing HQ instead of clicking for a credit lets Kate know you probably have Nisei in hand as well as reduces the number of cards in your hand if she does come after HQ and makes it harder if you just want to Jackson or Gift next turn."

Netrunner,3csajn,neutronicus,1 point,Fri Jul 10 14:49:09 2015 UTC,"Actually, does having the Hades in R&D change your mind?  With 9-Agenda RP and 1 Nisei in HQ I feel pretty good about TME for sure and not too terrible about Indexing.  But with the Hades lurking in R&D just waiting to lose me the game I'm actually kind of scared of Indexing and that makes me want to Pup it."
Netrunner,3csajn,Calc3,2,Fri Jul 10 19:59:46 2015 UTC,"Not quite sure I follow - the posted hand is intended to be post-mandatory draw. If you click to draw and see Hedge Fund, you don't have enough clicks for Hedge Fund, Tollbooth, Sundew, and if you don't, you're not going to see any more cards this turn.  Also, this leaves you with an open HQ with a Nisei in it. Is your thinking that if Kate Dirty Laundries some central to get at Sundew this turn, it's probably going to be R&D, or am I way off?"
Netrunner,3csajn,neutronicus,4,Fri Jul 10 12:46:04 2015 UTC,"Sorry, didn't realize this was a 6 card hand.  The logic is that even if she runs HQ, she's going to miss 75% of the time, and she's not going to do it more than once. You can Pup HQ here, but it's something you'd usually rather have on R&D. Playing Pup on HQ stops you from playing a drawn Celebrity Gift, (click one next turn is most likely draw), and and telegraphs you have an agenda in HQ. Playing it on R&D means the Dirty Laundry on HQ is 33% to hit as opposed to 25%. A central run is going to be good no matter where you put it, so you're better off keeping your options open and padding HQ."

Safer play: Eli on R&D, Pup on HQ, take 1 credit or draw. Risky play: Pup on HQ, Eli and Sundew on remote. You either start getting money, force the runner to use whole turn to trash Sundew, or get Maker's Eyed. :p"
Netrunner,3csajn,bblum,3,Fri Jul 10 11:22:13 2015 UTC,"Risky play: Pup on HQ, Eli and Sundew on remote.   If you are to play risky, have you considered skipping the Pup on HQ? If you put Pup on R&D instead and leave HQ open, it's pretty unlikely that Kate can actually afford a good Maker's Eye turn 1. Of course, Kate will probably run HQ at some point, so some of the time you lose a Nisei over it.  EDIT: Also, no matter where you put Pup, the worst case seems to be for Kate to click 1 Dirty Laundry whatever central is open, getting an access, click 2 run Sundew, and click 3 and 4 get through Eli to trash it, leaving Kate with 6 credits and the Corp with 2. Given that PPVP Kate generally plays 3 Dirty Laundry, that's going to happen some 30% of the time."
Netrunner,3csajn,TurbulentSocks,2,Fri Jul 10 11:55:49 2015 UTC,"If Kate wants to get that Sundew she would certainly run on HQ. It could be even for something mundane like Dirty Laundry.

Netrunner,3csajn,breakfastcandy,2,Fri Jul 10 11:59:44 2015 UTC,"No, it's a 1/3 chance of losing a Nisei and 1/3 of losing a Jackson. That said, I agree - trying to rush up a Sundew only seems worth it if you can start scoring fast, and giving up a Nisei seems to contradict that."

I think you almost certainly lose the Nisei if you go the risky route, but you end up in a much stronger board state if Kate spends her whole turn running HQ and trashing a Sundew, or lets you keep it."
Netrunner,3csajn,TheRabbler,2,Fri Jul 10 12:14:30 2015 UTC,"Pup R&D, take 2 credits.   1/5 of stealing Nisei is acceptable for this hand, and Id rather not over invest to protect it when we're this broke and there's no chance of a score for a long time anyway.  Pup helps against random access of NAPD or Future Perfect by hitting their money.  Turn 2, if we draw another agenda, maybe Eli on HQ and take 2. Otherwise, I would like to get that Sundew down behind Eli or Tollbooth soon to present a threat."
Netrunner,3csajn,ErikTwice,2,Fri Jul 10 13:43:18 2015 UTC,"My analysis: Pup is less taxing than Eli, is less taxing than Tollbooth. I want the most taxing ICE on R&D. Eli is better on remotes, but is good as the innermost R&D ICE. I want Pup on HQ because HQ is the least likely to give Good Stuff over the course of the game (It happens to be stacked now, but I tend to play like my HQ cards are all ICE all the time...) Additionally, Pup on HQ prevents a Dirty Laundry HQ, Jackson Trash. So I definitely like Pup on HQ.  I can't fight Kate's economy long-term. I sometimes will run a Sundew out naked to tax runner econ, but that's not acceptable against Kate. So if I play Sundew, I better be putting Eli over it. I look at it from the runner's perspective: If I see R&D open, and an ICE over a Sundew, I'm going to run R&D, then the Sundew. This line of play kills the Sundew at the cost of their entire turn... I don't much like this trade. So, I prefer Eli over R&D to close another central, and then last click for a credit.  I don't click to draw because I have a Jackson in my hand that I can use next turn. My next turn is pretty likely Install Jackson, Use Jackson, Install ICE. This forces Kate to run Jackson or else I'll have a full turn to use him next, which is not a good thing for them...  The only thing I see is that I could put Jackson out naked unrezzed instead of taking a credit. I have no immediate need for the credit, and having Jackson already out is pretty good for my next turn...  So my vote is: Pup HQ, Eli R&D, either Credit or Install Jackson."
Netrunner,3csajn,calimsha,2,Fri Jul 10 13:44:00 2015 UTC,"*Pup on R&D *Eli on HQ *Credit  My reasoning:  1) Leaving either of HQ or R&D open is a huge mistake because Kate can play either Legwork or Maker's Eye and make you lose an agenda. -> Even if she didn't have Legwork, a 33% chance to have a Nisei is not a chance I would ever take. -> Even if she didn't have Legwork, if she hits Jackson the game can spiral out of control. For example, imagine she trashes it and your next card draw is an agenda. Now you have a three-card hand with two agendas and no defenses whatsoever. That's a game-loss right there. -> She might play Dirty Laundry or Datasucker and make a run just to use those cards. So it's not even a matter of she wanting to get into HQ as going to HQ being a huge convenience!  2) I don't want to commit more than two pieces of ICE to HQ and Eli is better than Pup for that. Hence Pup goes to R&D and Eli goes to HQ.  3) I gain a credit because I have everything I need card-wise and Jackson will get me new cards sooner or later.  4) Leaving any server open is silly when have the risk-less choice of playing Sundew behind a face-down Tollbooth the next turn. The chance of having an agenda stolen is not worth two extra credits, specially when you have Jackson to draw more economy cards quickly.  The next turn, I would either use Jackson (Kate is rich and I draw an agenda) or play the Sundew behind a piece of ICE (She won't get hit by a Cortex Luck is she can avoid it and at worst she spend two credits and half of her turn running into it blind)."

Netrunner,3csajn,Vysetron,2,Fri Jul 10 21:42:24 2015 UTC,"Eli on the remote,sundew on remote as well and credit. You want to push a sundew Asap against Kate ."
Netrunner,3csajn,Vysetron,1 point,Fri Jul 10 17:10:58 2015 UTC,"Pup on HQ, Eli on the remote, Sundew the remote.  Reasons:  In the early game, even PPVP Kate likes to take turn 1 to do a little set up. If she kept her first hand, I'm guessing she has a prepaid and a juicy econ event to fire, or bare minimum, a Diesel she'd like to play and an SMC to drop. If she's going to spend a click anywhere facechecking stuff, it's reliably going to be into the unprotected R&D, which we know only has 7 agendas remaining in 43 cards. Even against a Maker's Eye, it's a reasonable choice to let your deck defend itself in this scenario, and you have in hand one of the precious three Niseis, which is often all it takes for RP to win.   If she DOES run HQ (I'd be hesitant in a game where Cortex Lock is a thing) you're going to take a significant chunk of change if she hits one of your remaining 3 cards, and your Sundew is still defensible guaranteeing economic value.  Even if you don't hit an econ card next turn (I'd likely spend click one drawing if I didn't bare minimum a Mental Health Clinic), Draw, Tollbooth over R&D, cred will at least put you in a position to dissuade Kate from being too aggressive about running next turn (where, remember, you should still be in a position to make 2 creds). Shortly thereafter you can use Jackson to stabilize some of the available tools in your hand and get to work setting your scoring remote.  Also a note on giving up a couple early accesses or perhaps losing that Nisei in your hand: If there's one thing that RP is strong at, it's playing from behind. The combined fearsome inevitability of a single token with Caprice in the scoring server can lock out the best runners with the best breakers and the biggest pile of money, so I make my moves in the interest of generating as much value as I can over the course of the whole game.  Case in point: Using a similar list, I was down 6-0 to a Prepaid Kate who'd stolen all three of my Niseis in Chicago, and went on to win the game 9-6. It took some luck, certainly, but there is little to no reason to panic giving up an early agenda as RP, it comes with the territory."
Netrunner,3ctg1v,tbigfish,3,Fri Jul 10 17:11:08 2015 UTC,"Currents are pretty rare from both sides. If your opponent has a current and you don't, your best option for dealing with it would be to steal an agenda. Deep R&D digs or lucky HQ pulls are usually how you would do that.  For enhanced login protocol, specifically, you can work around it by using card abilities for your runs (dirty laundry is a great one). ELP punishes overly aggressive players, and so you will want to make your regular runs worth more in terms of quality rather than quantity."
Netrunner,3ctg1v,JohnQK,2,Fri Jul 10 17:14:43 2015 UTC,"You just make a lot less probing runs, and try to only make impactful runs.

Netrunner,3ctg1v,Kivou,1 point,Fri Jul 10 17:41:11 2015 UTC,Runner currents are far less useful than corp ones because of the simple fact that it's easier for the corp to control scoring than the runner.

Netrunner,3ctg1v,corallein,1 point,Fri Jul 10 17:40:09 2015 UTC,"Well playing keyhole is a pretty strong counter.

But Midori is swapping from the board (where cards can be rezzed vs. unrezzed) and the hand.  (Where nothing is rezzed or unrezzed.)  I think the rule is ""Maintain all state that the two cards share, and define anything else if necessary.""  Moving cards from HQ onto a server requires additional information, since HQ doesn't track ""rezzed vs. unrezzed.""  While it would certainly be nice if Alelle Repression spelled it out, since they don't, I think we have to just fall back on the default - when the corp puts unrezzed cards into archives, they are facedown."

A man rose up in front of me, his arm ending in a gun, his blue body lithe and ready for action. Before I could react, his firearm was angled towards me, ready to blow away my Magnum Opus, and possibly do even more damage depending on how much money HB was willing to dump into slowing down someone like me, who they viewed as a 2-bit punk cutting into their profits. My brain wasn't ready for that kind of punishment.  BAM! I jacked out. I bolted out of my apartment, took the stairs two at a time down to the exit. The New Angeles night was bright, and a great number of people still meandered down the streets.   I turned the corner around my building, and there she was. ""Whaddaya buyin'?"" she asked with a grin.   ""What do you have? And make it quick!""  ""Hmm... Well, I have these E3 feedback implants.""   ""Nah, I already have a set of those.""

It hits you when you suffer the subroutines, when you bypass the ICE, when you trash ICE, etc. It's far more likely for Chum to zap you the moment you derez the ICE. Ask Lukas though.  Also, if Chum is still rezzed (and why wouldn't it be, if its subroutine fired), the Corp probably normally chooses to derez the Chum and let you continue to encounter this boosted ICE."

The Corp knows you can have whatever stings the most out of a Diesel worth of cards at instant speed! Wauw! Instant speed Parasite! Instant speed whatever breaker you need! So much instant!  Of course, the reason this is actually going to see play while Savoir Faire did not is that it's a pretty efficient card (doesn't take up MU and is really cheap) and doesn't require any setup. The ""drawback"" of needing to trash two or maybe three cards isn't that bad, as most events are non-essential, programs can generally be recurred, meaning that you're only really sad if you get two essential pieces of hardware/resources on there AND end up drawing through your deck. And honestly, most of the time neither of those two happen.  So in short, I'm going to play Street Peddler in everything. As the author mentioned, Hayley in particular will love it. Cheap resources are gold for getting mileage out of her ability, and Street Peddler can even be used to trigger her ability. Also, she's liable to run event-light anyway.

Someone tell me if this accurately summarizes the article:   Street Peddler is good by itself because <reasons> and it's specific interaction with <common cards>. As a no-investment card, it doesn't even dilute the strategy of an otherwise focused deck.  As a result, pretty much every Anarch should be running four unless they're <the Anarch equivalent to a hypothetical and probably non-existent Shaper deck that doesn't want SMC>.    Synergy cards that can start to abuse Street Peddler, like Off-Campus Apartment or Hayley Kaplan turn it into the Pokemon-equivalent of Bill, or the M:tG-equivalent of Ancestral Recall.  As a card that's effectively free to include and play in any deck, it will almost certainly be an automatic include for Runner decks on par with Jackson Howard."

Netrunner,3cqiel,Berrr,1 point,Fri Jul 10 22:37:45 2015 UTC,"Well, vinegarymink would have definitely benefited from reading my summary of his article before he wrote it. But he still got most of it right.  The card selection, hidden information, and click transference sections are all reasonably overhyped, but you can't write a whole article on one card without being a little overenthusiastic.  The pro-milling and anti-milling paragraphs were a little contradictory, but all the individual points were accurate.  He nailed the overall power level though. He especially nailed the conclusion, and the predictions about where it will see play. The card provides a relatively minor advantage as an econ card, but it so good even in the decks that want it the least that it's certain to be ubiquitous."
Netrunner,3cqiel,Glitch29,1 point,Sat Jul 11 05:16:50 2015 UTC,"It inaccurately summarizes it. It's great but not a definite auto-include. It improves a lot of decks but it's strictly worse in others. Event heavy decks like Prepaid Kate don't want it as there's too much risk that you'll land three events under there with no way to retrieve them. MaxX is probably the one Anarch that doesn't want it because she already has no trouble seeing her entire deck in a game. And even at one influence it's not high impact enough to be always worth the influence out of faction. It's a grease card, it makes your deck smoother, but it isn't a near guaranteed escape from a bad situation like Jackson is."
Netrunner,3crghw,SashaDreis,14,Fri Jul 10 04:28:05 2015 UTC,"The effects are done all at once, you can't do them one at a time.  This is always the case for ""Do ___ for each ____"".  For a previous ruling/example, see project junebug.  It has the same syntax, and with 3 counters you don't do 2 damage then 2 damage then 2 damage, you do all the damage as one lump.  So you would choose 5 cards in archives, and swap them with 5 cards in HQ.  You can't go one at a time and ""double swap"" some cards.  If you have more counters than cards in HQ or Archives, you take whichever has the least cards and do that many. (this is due to the ruling on partially resolvable effects, where lukas confirmed things like if you diesel with only 2 cards left you still draw the 2, and similar situations).  So if you have 1 card in archives and 5 in hq with 6 advancement counters, you only swap one card.   If you have 4 in archives, 3 in hq, and 6 advancement, you swap 3.  You do the maximum amount allowed, you cant choose do just do one card if you have 5 counters, 5 in archives, and 5 in hq."

Netrunner,3ctiep,sandweiche,8,Fri Jul 10 17:27:43 2015 UTC,"Too many hard counters?   I think that's the short version. Netrunner was not designed around sideboarding. Many cards are balanced around versatility vs strength.  There's also the practical problem of matches in NR being significantly longer than MtG matches, so you can't really do a BO3. You could sideboard after seeing their ID, but I don't think there's many clever decisions to be made there (e.g. bringing in Plascrete vs Weyland is obvious).  Instead you decide to include and remove cards from your deck based on what you expect other people in your area to be playing."
Netrunner,3ctiep,RogueCarpet,4,Fri Jul 10 17:39:08 2015 UTC,"You don't play more than one game with each deck. You play one game as corp and one game as runner. So a sideboard wouldn't do much.   Having said that, I really like no sideboards. Means you have to build your deck with ANYTHING in mind. Does this really popular thing phase me enough that I need to play cards around it, or can I play around it with the tools I have available? It makes deck building and player skill really emphasized.  Here is a link to the rotation policy. Basically, until early 2017, nothing rotates. Core sets and big boxes currently don't rotate."
Netrunner,3ctiep,AngryTetris,2,Fri Jul 10 17:44:35 2015 UTC,"With delays, it'll probably not happen until late 2017 at the earliest. I expect somewhere in the middle of 2018, personally."
Netrunner,3ctiep,chrsjxn,3,Fri Jul 10 20:38:39 2015 UTC,"Sideboarding in Netrunner is kind of a non-starter for a few reasons. The first being that every Runner's sideboard would look pretty much the same with the inclusion of as many silver bullet cards as possible (Plascrete Carapace, Clot, Deus X, Net-Ready Eyes). The other is the way the tournament structure is different from Magic; in Magic, you get a chance to swap sideboard cards between games, once you've seen the opponent's deck in action. But in Netrunner, there's no benefit to doing that, since each round consists of each player playing one game as corp and one game as runner. If they allowed you to make sideboard changes before the round started, you'd have to make an intelligent decision before the round started based on nothing but the opponent's ID. If you're against NEH, do you want the Clot or the extra Plascrete? Both are equally valid choices but it's a coin flip as to whether your opponent is on fast-advance or butcher shop.  It's troubling that Netrunner seems to spiraling into silver bullet roulette; both runner and corp decks need a plan for most reasonable contingencies, and that means sacrificing some others. If you're playing Kate, do you make your Fast Advance matchup weaker by dropping Legwork and Parasite so that you can make your RP/Blue Sun matchup better by including a David? Most Kate decks don't have a way to deal with Susanoo or early oversighted Curtain Walls easily. Do you swap your influence to cover that weak spot? In essence, the influence system IS the sideboarding, allowing you to spend a limited number of deck slots to cover things that your faction isn't good at.  The cards will rotate out, but not until something like 2018. And only the small expansions will rotate out; the Core set and the big-box expansions are permanent."
Netrunner,3ctiep,arribous,2,Fri Jul 10 17:49:33 2015 UTC,"I'd like to see sideboards myself, but as you say, there are some very hard counters.  More than that though, the round structure isn't conducive to sideboards, since you only play each side once in a matchup.   Card rotation is something they announced a little while ago, but won't start happening for a few years yet.  (Basically after a certain point cycles will be retired as new ones come in, though big box expansions will be forever legal)"
Netrunner,3ctiep,Nemisii,1 point,Fri Jul 10 17:39:21 2015 UTC,"There are a lot of counters in the game, and there are a lot of rules for deckbuidling (influence cost, agenda ratio) that would make sideboarding problematic.  This is a game of hidden information, technically you arent even supposed to scout your opponents before a match in a tourney, let along tinker with your deck to create a more favorable matchup.  There is rotation starting sometime in 2017 when the first 2 cycles (genesis and spin) will rotate out.  The core set and all deluxe expansions will be legal forever."
Netrunner,3ctiep,SonofSonofSpock,1 point,Fri Jul 10 17:42:42 2015 UTC,"In Magic you usually play three games each round, so there is an opportunity to gather information about your opponent's deck, then modify yours accordingly. Netrunner doesn't work that way, you play one game as the Runner and one game as the Corp, so, assuming you weren't scouting decks, which is considered unsportsmanlike according to the official rules, there's no real way to know what to board into.  As for rotation, The Core Set as well as any Deluxe Expansions will remain tournament legal while Data Packs will eventually start rotating out, although not until another two or so cycles from now."
Netrunner,3ctiep,AmtsboteHannes,-4,Fri Jul 10 17:47:32 2015 UTC,"I think sideboarding would be an interesting experiment. Here is an idea:  -Raise all minimum deck sizes by 5, without raising agenda point requirements. (Ex: A 54-card Corporation deck would need 20-21 agenda points.)  -At the start of the game, after IDs are revealed but before the opening hands are drawn, both players may remove up to five cards from their decks."

Netrunner,3csxc4,BountyHunterSAx,6,Fri Jul 10 14:47:15 2015 UTC,"Credit totals are seldom so low that 0/1/2 is a big decision for the corporation   This could indicate that you're not running aggressively enough, forcing the corp to rez every piece of ice they install, and trashing every economy asset you see.  The real silver bullet against Caprice is, like you said S&W, and I suspect with Drive-By out it will get stronger. A very convincing stainless steal silver-plated bullet is Vamp, which has the upside of not only guaranteeing Caprice access, but getting you into the scoring server for free.  Trash the ice if you're Anarch or Shaper, expose and trash if you're Criminal. Other than that, it's also viable to ignore the Caprice server, if you can use that time to establish R&D lock."
Netrunner,3csxc4,daytodave,5,Fri Jul 10 15:06:02 2015 UTC,"Your best bet against caprice is usually to control the corps economy so that they have less control over the psi game. A corp with say 2 credits will be very reluctant to bid 2 in a psi game, and if they do they wind up at 0 credits. Typically as runner, you bid 0 every time to make sure they are wasting credits to keep you out, then you make sure you trash any drip econ cards like sundew, pad, mental health etc. because eventually these cards will get the corp to 14+ credits, at which point they have all the money they need to bid whatever they want. Siphon/Vamp/Lamprey and other econ denial cards like crescentus can also work wonders. Try to force the corp to waste credits rezzing ice elsewhere. The poorer they are, the less likely caprice is to work for them. She's a real gold digger."
Netrunner,3csxc4,rubyvr00m,3,Fri Jul 10 15:07:11 2015 UTC,"Psi games are basically a Yomi based skill game.

If you can't outplay them, get better over time. See how other people play Psi games. If you can't do that, make the corp broke then screw them over."

Focus on other servers, etc. I identified these in my OP; but that's NOT what I was asking for. THIS is what i was asking for:  HOW do you 'win' the Psi game? How do you math/read this? How do you 'get in their head'? With the reliability needed to win in a game like this and on runs as critical as runs against RP tend to be.  Thus far, vicvon has proposed one method. Garlic, Kronos, and vysetron have all mentioned they would try to ""outthink""/""win"" the Psi games. I want more advice on this aspect; as it is an aspect of outplaying RP that I don't see.  For the record; I have won the majority of my vs. RP games. But I've done it by R&D lock, or dodging around the caprice. I want to enhance my skills if that were possible. If there IS a Yomi skill to be had here, I want to see how to pick that up.  -AHMAD"
Netrunner,3csxc4,rumirumirumirumi,2,Fri Jul 10 23:48:51 2015 UTC,"I think people responded the way they did to OP because you had a really whiny attitude about a card that's been out over a year and that we've all heard the same complaints about before.  Personally I use my psychic powers to win the psi game, but these are some things I've picked up while playing.  Look at their credits. If it feels like they have a lot, bet 2 or 0. Now it's 50/50.  If it feels like they have a few but not many, bet 0. The odds are good that you'll get it.  If they have 2, bet 0 and be prepared to run again. You'll either win it there or you'll have another sit and you'll win it betting 0.  Betting 1 is a rarity for good corps who don't randomize. If you're hitting 0 a lot, they're will be a timing when they'll choose 1 and you'll have to look for it. When they're on 4-2 credits it's somewhat more likely.  If they notice you linking at their credit pool, use all the same principles except replace 2 with 0 and 0 with 2. Other than that, just do what you're doing and win your games anyway."
Netrunner,3csxc4,hamburglerX,2,Sat Jul 11 13:09:03 2015 UTC,"I don't think you understand how the psi game works. It sounds like you read the card as ""there is a 60% chance the run will end"", so you think it's just bad luck if you get screwed by it and therefore a badly designed card. It's almost never luck, there is far more luck involved in what cards the players draw during a game than what players pick during psi games.  The amount either player is going to spend on the psi game does not exist in a vacuum; how easily can the players regenerate the credits they spend on it? do they need the money elsewhere this turn? Does the runner have reason to believe the agenda behind Caprice is NAPD and therefore need to conserve money?  Going beyond that, think about how the player has been playing; are they a defensive player and therefore willing to spend the 2 credits to supposedly keep you out, or are they willing to risk spending nothing so that they can use the money to advance agendas? Can you trick the other player into reading you wrong by spending zero credits when you have a ton?"

Netrunner,3csxc4,kronosdev,2,Sat Jul 11 17:32:28 2015 UTC,"Most people who roll a die are lying to either you, themselves, or both. If they choose to ignore their own board state and make a choice based on chance in a close game where money is tight and they have things to rez and cards to play, then they are an inferior player that you can eventually deny resources from until you win that psi game. If you let them take off and set up enough ICE on servers and gain enough drip econ to have the freedom to roll a die for multiple accesses a turn and not care about their credit total then you were never going to win anyway. Rolling the die is not the issue. The issue is the presence of three equally viable options during the psi game. For example when the corp is broke there is only one viable option for them during the psi game. The goal is, through economic denial, central pressure, and knowledge of the matchup, to keep the corps number of viable options during a psi game down to 2 if you can. The presence, or lack thereof, of a clairvoyant polyhedral die is irrelevant.  And if they actually do roll a die?... Yolo bet 2 every time. ; )"

I recognize that that's a possibility. Hell, my wins against this abomination when I've seen it online tend to be because I do treat the Caprice server as basically unassailable once it's 1-ice'd. Instead go for Siphons. Mediums. legwork lock. Other win-conditions. And the random 1/3 chance to snipe an agenda from the scoring remote when they finally put one down.  But this isn't about that. This is specifically about dealing WITH Caprice. Not dealing around it. Someone mentioning S&W, for example, would be appropriate to the thread. . . . even if I'd rather not think about the gun.  -AHMAD"
Netrunner,3csxc4,Lluluien,2,Fri Jul 10 14:51:26 2015 UTC,"One thing you can't do is camp on the remote and build up credits. You need to be able to constantly threaten the centrals to force the RP player to react and defend themselves. Ice destruction certainly helps, but you can't expect to destroy every piece of ice: you need to be selective based on what's efficient to break and what's going to stop your runs more often.  Toolbox shapers can have a pretty strong position against RP so long as they can deny Sundews and put pressure on centrals. If you trash Caprice from R&D they can't put it on their remote, they'll have to work harder to defend centrals, and they won't have as much money which keeps them from rezzing problematic ice and hems them in when it comes to the psi game.  I think the psi game is an interesting mechanic because it gives Jinteki an extra avenue to playing the game. It's often difficult to win the money game as Jinteki unless you're holding out for Sundew money in a strong remote. Runners can often enough make plenty of money to pressure centrals and build toward multiple runs down the scoring remote. Psi games give them a fighting chance against such runners, and while it might be frustrating for runners to lose the psi game over and over, one loss by the corp can mean the whole game is over. I think Caprice is interesting design, and Marcus Batty too. In combination they can be wickedly powerful, but the best strategy for the runner is to never let it get to that point."
Netrunner,3csxc4,rumirumirumirumi,1 point,Fri Jul 10 15:14:30 2015 UTC,"I think it's strange that you should say that it's difficult to win the money game as Jinteki, because I think the strength of Replicating Perfection over the last several months is almost entirely tied to how bat-shit insane Sundew is in conjunction with RP.  The deck would work without them based on the strength of Caprice and The Future Perfect, but what really makes it oppressive, in my opinion, is Sundew and Jackson Howard.  I know you specifically mention ""Sundew money in a strong remote"" yourself, but I don't think it's fair to say ""Jinteki"" means ""Jinteki-with-the-exception-of-RP"" since RP is Jinteki right now."
Netrunner,3csxc4,neutronicus,1 point,Fri Jul 10 19:41:16 2015 UTC,"Sundew is strong, but putting Sundew in your scoring remote is a double-edged sword: you're getting money but you're stuck without a chance to score. When you do go to score in that remote you end up trashing your econ, and unless those are the winning points you're installing, you're going to need more money later. This is especially true if they are destroying or derezzing your ice or putting a lot of pressure on your centrals. If you don't defend the Sundew in a substantial way it becomes an immediate target, and every credit you spend defending Sundew is taking away from its returns.  RP can make a ton of money if it is left unchecked, and playing a mid range style of runner requires you have a suitable econ engine to face off with it. But it's possible to deny them a strong economy without necessarily playing a lot of denial cards, and that can make Caprice less formidable.  EDIT: also, Sundew has been out for more than a year. I thought RP was a strong ID at that point, but it didn't become the dominant force it is until ELP really hammered home the click tax. Since then there's been a lot of other cards that have found a good home in RP, and I think it's these plus the fallout from Clot that has made these past months The Season of Perfection."
Netrunner,3csxc4,neutronicus,1 point,Fri Jul 10 22:12:22 2015 UTC,"If runners are contesting Sundew and refraining from making shitty runs on Centrals, they'll usually be out-money-ing RP.  This is in contrast to EtF, who still usually out-money the runner."

Another way is to consider the board state of things. I've played so many games against caprice users and have won a fair amount by thinking as the Corp is the runner is low on econ and you're not then bid 2, if they're high on credits or matching then bid 0 as they'll usually assume that you're willing to spend to stop them. Its not foolproof but also running at caprice a number of times can sometimes be good if only to see the Corp players pattern. Is it wise to do this? Nope, not one iota but you're looking for ways and that's one. Another way is run r&d pretty heavily and you'll hit a caprice to trash it."

It's great that it doesn't require and install and it's a little more user friendly.    However, at no point in its history has it been quite as stable as octgn or quite as fully technically integrated (even if sometimes that usage wasn't very user friendly, you had to do all sorts of targeting the right thing while clicking on the other right thing and pressing some shortcut), even if it was close which is why most previous tournaments were on octgn."

Netrunner,3cq10y,Lomar4976,2,Thu Jul 9 22:31:26 2015 UTC,"Browsing the implementation posts, it looks like at least some of the cards are manual."
Netrunner,3cq10y,llama66613,2,Thu Jul 9 22:48:36 2015 UTC,"Yes.  Some are implemented so you manually have to target cards and double click to use the ability, but they all work correctly.  Octgn in general is a little more manual - it relies a bit more on the player knowing the rules and taking the right steps in the right order.  However, if you do, you are rewarded with a pretty robust experience.  That's why neither jinteki.net nor octgn are ""better"", both offer different experiences with different pros and cons."
Netrunner,3cq10y,JoelCFC25,2,Thu Jul 9 23:12:44 2015 UTC,"as stable as octgn   Actually, the main reason I use it is because I had sooooo many disconnects that rendered the game unplayable on OCTGN."

Netrunner,3covsy,PaxCecilia,7,Thu Jul 9 23:38:13 2015 UTC,"My meta is a total crap shoot. People tend to bring a different deck every Thursday night, however I love that a local player has taken Nisei Division to a completely frustrating realm of Psi-game Godliness.  Typically the only protection I default in my decks is one Plascrete just because there was a big presence of those Blue Sun Government Takeover flatline decks throughout the regionals season. Very rarely do I build decks with Clot or Feedback for casual nights. I've never even played Feedback at tournaments, no one plays brain or net damage..."
Netrunner,3covsy,DarQraven,6,Thu Jul 9 16:40:31 2015 UTC,"My meta, if you can call it that, is core + genesis cycle only for the time being. We've been setting up a local play group and trying to bring in newbies, and have found that running a limited-cardpool league was probably the best way to do it.  Now that we've almost finished the current league, we'll probably add in C&C + spin cycle and see how that goes.  So, to summarize, my meta consists of:   Weird HB:FA with some Archers for good measure Andysucker Janky-ass slow shaper decks, or the infamous Crypsis-only gabe."
Netrunner,3covsy,jkopplin,2,Thu Jul 9 18:09:29 2015 UTC,"That's a really cool way to do it. I've been mulling trying something similar, actually. The really big scene is in the the next town over, about 45 minutes away. My wife and I were the only players in our town. We almost stopped playing. Then, out of the blue, two other couples started playing. So now we have a nice little six-person meta made up of three couples. We're talking about doing some game night kits or something. I'd like them to only have to deal with a limited cardpool. I stopped in the shop the other night and all I had handy was NEH Butchershop. This guy building out of his core set is grasping the game but didn't stand a chance. Core plus Genesis solves almost everything. Adding Creation and Control plus Spin Cycle fixes most of the balance issues. Corp has Jackson and runner has Plascrete."
Netrunner,3covsy,DarQraven,3,Thu Jul 9 18:46:38 2015 UTC,"Yeah, there were several reasons for the restricted cardpool.  Most importantly, Netrunner is as much a game of strategy as it is a game of good guesswork. What could that ICE be? What is the runner trying to do? Is that a trap and if so, how can I avoid it? Learning four cycles worth of ICE, traps and combos is complete overkill and would totally overshadow any positive aspects of the game for a newbie. I've been in that position myself, and your matches feel like a complete crapshoot. A game of hidden information where you don't even know what something could be is not a game anymore.  Second, we did not want to send the message that you either buy hundreds of dollars worth of cards or autolose your games. Regardless of what people say, there is power creep in Netrunner. Not so much on the level of individual cards, but definitely in terms of deck archetypes. A core+genesis Andysucker will lose to a fully tricked-out RP or butchershop. A shaper without C&C will lose pretty much any matchup. Pick any deck type that's been around for a while, and newer decks will outperform it if not stomp it.  Overall, I'd say it was successful. We've gotten several of the newer players buying packs because they are excited about the cards in them (not because they need them), building their own decks and analyzing their play. Several are now 'up to date' with C&C in terms of knowledge and datapacks, so we can just about move on. Can definitely recommend.  One additional note is that we wanted to prevent hardcountering. If a beginner finds a good deck or playstyle, we didn't want it invalidated 1 day later. Similarly, we didn't want anyone stuck for a month with a deck that wasn't working against the 'meta'.  We addressed this in two ways. There was a rule that, while you couldn't switch ID for the duration of the league, you could tweak your deck between nights. Most experienced players made only minor changes, but it allowed newbies to experiment with what works and what doesn't. Second (and we sort of messed up with this in practice) you wouldn't know who you would play against before the games started. This prevents me from including 3 Plascretes if I know I'm playing against a guy who's going all-in scorch."
Netrunner,3covsy,dios_Achilleus,2,Thu Jul 9 19:17:35 2015 UTC,I would be interested in reading about your adventures in starting a league like this if you care to post more details.
Netrunner,3covsy,Elthane,1 point,Thu Jul 9 22:52:34 2015 UTC,"Ditto. We tried something similar a while back, but I think we introduced datapacks too slowly and advertised it as a ""newb league"" and these factors contributed to the overall downfall of the thing since the experienced players didn't want to participate and the so-called newbs got bored."
Netrunner,3covsy,jkopplin,6,Sat Jul 11 02:17:16 2015 UTC,"My meta is weird. I live in a smallish midwestern town. We have a strong, regular group for a metro area of maybe 100k people total. So whenever I make it into the shop I get to play those dozen or so guys regularly. There's some strong players there including several top 16 worlds finishers. But we still get big turnout for Store Championships and have even hosted a regional the last two years. For those, meta concerns go out the freaking window because people travel from all over the state."

We've been expanding into our larger meta centered around a game store and start a league tonight actually.  From what I've played outside my main group, it's pretty similar.

Enjoys flatlining people. She is really good at piloting Jinteki, I think.  My other friend: Loves Weyland more than anything. He really loves brewing and making new decks, but he cannot resist the lure of Argus Security for too long. REALLY enjoys flatlining people. Really wants to Vamp and Account Siphon corps into oblivion but doesn't build that deck as much as he feels like that doesn't lead to as fun games for everyone. What a scrub!  It's incredibly fun!

Last week I didn't play one RP all night, and wished I'd bought Clot because there were a lot of fast NBN decks (two people playing variants of that one from the Bratislava regionals) I could do nothing about. This week I played two completely different Cybernetics Division decks - one killed me with meat damage, the other I scraped the win on -5 hand size.

The opposite, in fact, as runners got a huge FA hate card in the form of Clot.  For general jank-but-actually-good corp silliness, my favorite new deck has been HB Golden Batty, which uses Marcus Batty to force a hit with a NEXT Gold's destroyer sub. Get a few NEXT ice rezzed and any server with an upgrade and an unrezzed ice could mean an instant rig trash. However, it unfortunately requires two data packs (The Valley for NEXT Gold and The Underway for Marcus Batty)."
Netrunner,3cpkep,SparklingEmoWendigo,3,Thu Jul 9 20:03:23 2015 UTC,"I'd suggest Breaker Bay, but any pack in the SanSan cycle has some fun cards.  Breaker Bay gives a nice piece of ice for each corp (Turing, Crick, Gutenberg and Meru Mati). There's also Breaker Bay Grid for cheap asset shenanigans, like free Eve Campaigns or cheap Off the Grids.  The Underway has Marcus Batty that everyone seems to be excited for, with a Caprice Nisei-like effect of forcing an ice subroutine to be suffered. There's also Contract Killer for shooting Kati Jones or the runner. Allele Repression also seems fun (Personal jank: recycling Cerebral Cast or Celebrity Gift).  The Valley would round out your friend's collection of NEXT ice with NEXT Gold. There's also the Jinteki Biotech ID which lets you start mind games right off the bat by picking one of three ID effects.  Finally, Chrome City has the HB identity Cybernetics Division and the agenda Self-Destruct Chips, which support some kind of brain damage/hand size reducing deck. Weyland gets Oaktown Renovation which gives the corp money for advancing it."
Netrunner,3cpkep,Cobalt50,2,Thu Jul 9 20:28:33 2015 UTC,"I think The Source is a good data pack for Corp Jank. IT Department, Industrial Genomics, and Shoot the Moon offer quirky decks for HB, Jinteki, and NBN respectively. Plus Turtlebacks can be great in NEH if he likes that for fast advance."

I'd want to run at least 3, maybe even 4 depending on the amount of burst draw and dependency on the UWC.  UWC really shines if you get it online on turn 1-3..if you have to wait for link to show up until turn 10, it's not really even going to pay for itself when you account for install costs (2c+3c for UWC+Dyson, not to mention the clicks used). Unless of course it's usually a long game (if you're running denial, for example) but sounds to me like you aren't, if you're going for Geneshop and got influence to spare (so not running Account Siphons)."

Netrunner,3coozj,WolfOne,2,Thu Jul 9 15:38:57 2015 UTC,"I had this planned for an eventual Custom Card day on Hardware, but figured it might fit here aswell:    Quantum Manipulator  Hardware - Accessory  2 cost - 0 Influence - Neutral  [Trash] : Win a psi-game. Use this ability before either player has spend credits.  [Trash] : Gain 4 credits.    Wording might need to be looked at, since there's not actually a timing window to use the first ability in. I suppose one would have to use the 'prevent' phrase.  Second ability, because the primary one is fairly narrow in scope (I wish FFG did this more, only Fall Guy and Infiltration does I think).  With a proper setup, the second ability could possibly be decent econ. Replicating Kate with a Macrodrive or some such.  Gaining 4 credits in any activation window is in itself an okay ability I guess.  Edit: Thinking about it -- Thematically I think there should be a click cost associated with the second ability - if you're cheating a casino or whatever for money, you're probably not doing it mid-run."

Netrunner,3coozj,r2devo,1 point,Fri Jul 10 07:10:39 2015 UTC,"Heck, I'd settle for just making the psi-game 2/3 in favor of the runner instead of corp, or just 50-50, instead of absurdly in favor of the corp."
Netrunner,3coozj,DaveyCricket,2,Fri Jul 10 01:24:32 2015 UTC,"What about something like  Probability Curve  Resource - Virtual  0 cost - 1 influence - Neutral  [Trash] : You and the Corp secretly spend 0, 1 or 2. Reveal spent credits. If you and the Corp spent the same number of credits, cancel the Corp's effect. Use this ability only after you and the Corp compare secretly spent credits.    Not sure about the wording - ""cancel the Corp's effect"" seems too broad but I couldn't figure out how else to get it across.  So as Runner you'd probably just spend 0 on the Corp-initiated psi game, and they'll have to spend at least 1 or 2 to beat you, and then you do the psi game over.  But as the Corp - well, you'll know the Runner is going to spend 0, so you'll just always spend 1. But the Runner will know you're going to spend 1, right? So maybe you should spend 0. Aw, hell, spend 2 to be safe.   Basically shifting a little of the psi game burden over to the Corp side."
Netrunner,3coozj,amightyrobot,1 point,Fri Jul 10 09:43:23 2015 UTC,"Wording on that first trash effect is going to get hairy. The cards never ever use the term ""Psi game"" do they? Not even on Nisei Division."

Netrunner,3coozj,Carsten69,1 point,Fri Jul 10 10:16:26 2015 UTC,"Trash: Use this ability only during a run. The first time you reveal secretly spent credits this run, you are considered to have spent a different number of credits than the Corp for the purposes of card effects.

Netrunner,3coozj,Bwob,1 point,Thu Jul 9 20:33:05 2015 UTC,"As every one points out, Quest Complete does bypass Caprice, its just such a wonky card that your deck kind of needs to be built around it.  Here is my idea (taken from the ""Fixing Link"" thread):    Angry Mob (Anarch)  Event: Run • Cost: 6 • Influence: 4  The cost of Angry Mob is reduced by 1 for each [link] you have. Make a run. When you pass the last piece of ice protecting that server, trash one Upgrade in that server at no cost and end the run.    So you still have to break the Ice, but since it triggers at the same time as Caprice, and you have Priority, you get to trash Caprice for free and get booted. You can then run back and access.   This card is designed to be useful in other situations, but also limited in its usage - at 6 cost (5 if you start with a Link) its not going to be much cheaper than just trashing the asset, and since you get booted, its not going to combo with other ""successful run"" triggers, but once you have a few link it might be cheaper than trashing, and its also fine against something like Ash that triggers when the Run is successful (although only if its rezzed)."
Netrunner,3coozj,vampire0,1 point,Thu Jul 9 17:06:46 2015 UTC,"I think it would have to say '...that server, you may trash one rezzed Upgrade in that server at no cost and end the run.'  This way you can still deal with unrezzed Caprice servers. If they don't rez Caprice before you get past the last piece of ICE, you can just succeed/access normally. If they do rez her, you can 'jack out' and kill Caprice."

They had to waste every stealth credit to get a single virus counter and I scored out to 8 points the next turn they did.   I can't count the number of times that I've seen people playing a runner with like 6-7 on datasucker and just don't purge. Especially when all centrals are iced up and on a competitive level when the runner has enough credits for parasite. It's madness to me, tempo loss be damned. I'd rather them not be able to kill anything via parasite and lose maybe 1 turn(Not with cyberdex virus suite or Cyberdex trial) and force them to have to spend actual credits to get those sucker tokens."
Netrunner,3cmmvk,vicvonshroom,1 point,Thu Jul 9 05:16:30 2015 UTC,"I usually remember that I can purge.  The one that I'm annoyed at myself about is when I really needed to purge, really needed to install a piece of ice, and had a scored Mandatory Upgrades. Purge doesn't always use up your whole turn!"
Netrunner,3cmmvk,m50d,1 point,Thu Jul 9 21:06:58 2015 UTC,"yeah, true. It's just that so many times I've seen games go south for a corp because they didn't purge, even when they knew the runner would lose if they did. They played to the idea that it's a massive tempo loss and I think that sometimes you have to just take the loss or plan for the eventual tempo loss. Though it does depend of the local meta."
Netrunner,3cmmvk,vicvonshroom,5,Thu Jul 9 21:37:03 2015 UTC,"Playing to win is better than playing to not lose. If you have a risky play with a 40% chance of success, it's often better than a move that looks safe now but will lead to you losing long term. Sometimes you just need to Fast Track an agenda even with R&D or HQ wide open, or Medium dig down R&D even though they can Scorch you next turn.   Obviously this requires a ton of reading the game state and knowing your deck really well, but this is one of the most important concepts I've learned lately."
Netrunner,3cmmvk,losspider,2,Thu Jul 9 10:12:35 2015 UTC,"Great post. I'll add that if you try to play 'safe' all the time, not only do you miss chances to win but you also become extremely predictable."
Netrunner,3cmmvk,Kivou,2,Thu Jul 9 12:26:15 2015 UTC,Definitely. Might put together something a bit more in-depth about this actually.
Netrunner,3cmmvk,losspider,8,Thu Jul 9 13:57:26 2015 UTC,"I'm an avid teacher of Netrunner. By now, I've introduced at the absolute minimum 50 people to the game. Unlike Chess or Go -- games of perfect information -- it's not always feasible to create a ""teaching game"" to explain everything while still maintaining the game state.  So instead, I just play as a teacher sometimes. Obviously this needs to be done delicately and when the person I'm playing against is interested in learning to run better rather than ""just wanting to play, OK?""  What you do is this. You play your game. . . and then when you see them about to do something silly; like say Inside-Job into R&D because they can't get past your architect yet . . .but just for a random single access at a non-critical juncture. You stop the game. You ask them ""why"". You make them think about the play. Think about the choice. Think about the value of Inside Job. Paint a picture of ""what if next turn I Install-Advance-Advance. Wouldn't you WISH you'd saved it?""  Or, ""you want in to R&D. There's an ice in your way. Why not spend the time (clicks) looking for your breaker instead?""  Back in core+genesis cycle, runners had little reason NOT to run boldly and 'face-check' with perhaps just Faerie for defense. I explain this concept by asking an opponent to look at my credit stack and ask them: ""What's the WORST thing that I could do to you?"" Make them go through the mental exercise of trying to study a board-state and determine the 'right' play.  The truth is, most games most the time there's a learning moment. Especially for an inexperienced runner, because an inexperienced corp can put ice in the wrong spot and just that alone reverse the outcome and flow of an entire game. The trick is being teacher enough to take the time (and yes, sacrifice the game) to point it out to your opponent.  -AHMAD"
Netrunner,3cmmvk,BountyHunterSAx,6,Thu Jul 9 04:49:38 2015 UTC,"I remember playing the last swiss game of the Spanish Nationals and being in an incredible position. I had five points, I had a lot of money and was R&D locking Jinteki RP with R&D Interface. My only worry was a Caprice sitting naked on a remote  So I ran her practically twice every turn, because she was the only thing that could turn the game around and let him win the round. My money wasn't an issue and I couldn't hit R&D harder so that Caprice represented his only chance to win. And after eight failed psi games and a Lotus Field I could break, I lost the game.  For a long time I said this was the only time I felt I had lost a game to Caprice. But looking back to it, I feel I was beyond wrong. I lost that game and for many, many reasons.  1) I should have bid 0 every single time. He didn't have 8 credits to spend, much less 8 credits plus the five of Lotus Field. I had him controlled economically and if he was spending the three credits he could earn per turn on Caprice, he was simply dragging an R&D lock that would lose him the game.  2) I was bidding wrong on a psychological level. I was trying to ""get"" him, trying to outsmart him. In my experience, this is a poor tactic. Most of the time you should bid as the game board dictates and only try to outsmart when you are psychologically certain it's the right move. This is like dropping an Astro naked in a remote, you have to search for the same feeling of ""I know it's going to be one"".  3) I was in a bad situation because I couldn't force a victory. And I couldn't force a victory because my deck was flawed. Had I played Medium over R&D Interface I wouldn't have lost this game because I could have pushed to victory instead of giving the Corp a whole turn per new card I want to see. Of course, this open a new can of problems, but the fact persists: My deck had a flaw that I should have kept in mind but didn't even realize at the time.  So yeah, that's a good example, I think."

It looked like 20 cards left with 10 points on the table. Or 5 if the runner can't take the NAPD. 3 points against a medium with 1 token on it is acceptable to me, if I'm winning next turn   The runner was also pretty lucky with his accesses, I think.

Netrunner,3cl6si,vampire0,3,Wed Jul 8 21:18:57 2015 UTC,"I mean, kinda. Scorch still requires a tag, might as well spend a click to trash Crash Space first."
Netrunner,3cl6si,spiralshadow,3,Wed Jul 8 21:20:47 2015 UTC,"Against SEA Scorch, needing them to trash the Crash Space is as good as a Plastacrete in terms of protection, since they can't kill you in one turn with 4 cards in hand. On your turn just shed the tag.  Against Midseasons its tougher - they can Midseason, trash a Crash Space and then Scorch, but you're still safe holding 4 cards, at least for a turn. With 2 Crash Spaces then they have to trash both and work on you next turn, so that is still a whole turn you get to try to survive. Considering the Corp has to hold back credits from the Midseason so they can trash the Crash Space, that means they either landed a smaller pile of tags, are broke completely, or delayed 1 or more turns in landing the Midseason. Since Midseason has to be played the turn after you scored an agenda, that means you made the Corp's window to land the tag-storm a lot narrower.  Given that it gives free credits to remove tags from Account Siphon to keep up your cash while still trying to go tagless on top of all that, it seems like a good deal. Plastacrete is slightly harder to destroy, but it also costs one more credit, doesn't do anything while installed, and doesn't benefit you when you're not playing against Scorch."

Netrunner,3cl6si,MagnumNopus,2,Wed Jul 8 22:33:55 2015 UTC,"cascading triggers. It's in the FAQ. If something triggers in the middle of the resolution of something else, the new trigger resolves before continuing the resolution of the original effect. So in this case, corp plays scorched earth. You trash crash space to prevent 3 of the damage and trigger geist because you used a trash effect you draw your card to resolve the geist trigger before continuing the resolution of SE. This means that if you had 0 cards in hand, you would draw up to 1 before the 1 point of damage got through, thus keeping you alive"
Netrunner,3cl6si,Raikitm,1 point,Wed Jul 8 19:46:43 2015 UTC,"It's my understanding that the Geist trigger would happen first.

Netrunner,3cicca,RestarttGaming,13,Wed Jul 8 03:34:36 2015 UTC,"the reason is because Lukas said so.   Or, you know, because the rules say so.    FAQ 2.0, Page 3, Column 1, Paragraph 10 A player cannot trigger an action/ability unless he or she is also able to resolve it."

Netrunner,3cicca,Jakodrako,3,Wed Jul 8 05:01:11 2015 UTC,"No problem!  The thing to consider when asking ""does this change the game state?"" is always to ask the effect of the action/ability in question. It doesn't matter if the costs change the game state, it doesn't matter if any further abilities trigger off of the ability, it doesn't even matter if the game ""engine"" itself changes the game state due to the use of the ability (such as the hosted cards on Street Peddler being trashed due to the hosting rules). The only thing that matters is to ask does the effect of this ability change the game state? Is it resolvable?  Hope that helps!"
Netrunner,3cicca,RestarttGaming,2,Wed Jul 8 05:14:47 2015 UTC,"Yes, thats true.  Normally a reading of the rules would suggest you cannot trigger street peddler.  However, rules have been overturned before by FAQs and tweets.  So the most final say is if lukas confirms it.  Regardless of what it says in the rules, when Lukas or an FAQ says otherwise, it's lukas/the FAQ that is Netrunner official.  So if you want the most definitive version that will definitely be true, if lukas has said something on the subject you use that.  Thats where i was going with that statement.  Not to say the basic rules didn't have it, but to say it's been confirmed in the most solid way possible in netrunner, on twitter."

Netrunner,3cicca,NotReallyFromTheUK,-13,Wed Jul 8 18:43:37 2015 UTC,This is garbage.  The events are just stuck there for the rest of the game unless you have some other way of trashing street peddler.  They need to change this rule fast.
Netrunner,3cicca,Rejusu,7,Wed Jul 8 06:12:38 2015 UTC,"This is no different to installing a console or any other non-program card with a downside (the downside of consoles being that you can only have one installed). You simply build around it. You don't include multiple types of consoles, you include Aesop's or Chronotype with Wyldside if you don't want to be down a click the entire game. You don't include Street Peddler if your deck is 50% events.  If you're frequently hitting three events with Peddler that's a problem with your deck composition, not the rules."
Netrunner,3cicca,NotReallyFromTheUK,-2,Wed Jul 8 10:46:02 2015 UTC,No.  It's a problem with the rules.  Just because I cannot resolve the ability should not mean I cannot pay the cost.  That is very different from the way consoles work.  It's not an explicit downside to the card.  It's an implicit one hidden in a bad ruling.
Netrunner,3cicca,Rejusu,1 point,Thu Jul 9 23:10:42 2015 UTC,"By that logic you could argue that just because you can't pay the cost should not mean you cannot resolve the ability. You can't just separate cost from effect when it's convenient for you. And what exactly is bad about this rule? That it makes an already excellent card slightly less excellent? Oh boo hoo. Just because you don't like the way something works and you think it should work differently does not constitute a valid argument as to why it's bad. A bad rule is something that is one of several things: unintuitive, ambiguous, inconsistent, or detrimental to the game.  What's your argument that it falls under one of those categories? And don't say it's bad because it makes Peddler less of a great card. As for consoles that it's implicit rather than explicit is neither here nor there. It's a downside, most cards have them whether implicitly or explicitly. Deal with it."
Netrunner,3cicca,NotReallyFromTheUK,0,Fri Jul 10 08:58:29 2015 UTC,"That's the dumbest thing I've ever heard.  I'm sorry, but I can't keep having a civilized argument if that's the way you are going to argue.  In no way is this the same thing as having an ability resolve without paying its cost.  That is a core part of practically all card games.  Pay the cost, get the ability.  But I should still be able to attempt to activate an ability and have it fail.  An ability ""fizzling"" is a pretty important failsafe in the ""cost: ability"" paradigm.  If you want me to classify it, it's unintuitive.  Oh, and when you respond, please avoid the childish crying noises, they make you sound like an asshole."
Netrunner,3cicca,Rejusu,1 point,Fri Jul 10 18:04:05 2015 UTC,"Oh grow up. The childish crying noises are there because you acting childish by complaining that a rule is ""bad"" and ""garbage"" not because of any valid reasoning (as your comments up to now can be paraphrased as ""this is bad"" and ""it shouldn't work this way"") but because you disapprove of how it functions. If that makes me sound like an asshole, well I really couldn't care less. Sometimes being an asshole and being brutally blunt is the easiest way to get your point across. And please get down off your high horse. You don't get to make a whole speech about being ""civilized"" when you start with ""That's the dumbest thing I've ever heard"" and then finish by calling me an asshole. That's just the pot calling the kettle black.  Now to address your inane argument, but wait! What's this? You've defeated your own argument for me? How kind of you!   Pay the cost, get the ability.   Pay the cost... get the ability. Pay the cost... get the ability. Pay the cost... get the ability.   a core part of practically all card games.   Pay the cost, get the ability. Now tell me. If you trash peddler but don't install which one of those things are you not doing. I've made it easy for you to answer, it should be very obvious to figure out which part of this ""core part of practically all card games"" isn't happening.   In no way is this the same thing as having an ability resolve without paying its cost.   Hmm so how is having an ability resolve without paying its cost ""in no way"" like paying a cost without having an ability resolve? The answer is it's not. It is like paying a cost without having an ability resolve in that you are separating cause from effect. You cannot argue that it's fine to have a cause without an effect and then turn around and say it's ridiculous to have an effect without a cause, because frankly both are ridiculous arguments.   But I should still be able to attempt to activate an ability and have it fail.    Again! This is all your argument as to why the rule is ""bad"" or ""garbage"" boils down to! I should be able to do this, it should work this way, it shouldn't work that way. You never address what should be at the core of any argument: why. You don't say it should work this way or you should be able to do something because x (x being a reason why you should be able to do it). You just make statements and expect everyone to accept your word is law. It's bad because you say it's bad. It should work this way because you say so. Sorry buddy but that's not how an argument works. This is the first comment you've made that has any sort of reasoning (albeit flawed reasoning) and it's still contaminated with unjustified statements. Like this one:   If you want me to classify it, it's unintuitive.   And uh why is it unintuitive? Again you've omitted the most important part of an argument. You say it's unintuitive, no reason as to why that is, and expect it to be accepted. Now I'll show you how it should be done, here's why it isn't unintuitive:  What exactly do you expect to happen when you pay a cost? Nothing? Something unrelated to what you're paying for? No when you go into a shop and you see something for £2 which you then give the shopkeeper £2 for you expect to receive that item. That is an intuitive scenario, it's one we encounter daily. Now other things happen when you pay for that item that are only indirectly related to you receiving that item. Like getting a receipt. Now say that £2 item is out of stock, would you say you should still be able to pay £2 and receive a receipt for it? That it's an intuitive scenario?  Paid abilities in Netrunner are intuitive because they mirror other aspects of life, namely as I've already mentioned: cause and effect. Paying a cost without resolving the ability however does not have such parallels, it's unintuitive and as such it's not something you ever even think of doing except in weird fringe cases like this. Tell me before Peddler (and Geist is actually a similar example) came along have you ever thought that you should be able to pay costs without resolving the associated abilities? No? Is it because it's counter-intuitive? Exactly. You don't consider paying 5 credits for Sure Gamble and not gaining 9 back, you don't consider playing Diesel with an empty stack.  And finally your last ""point"":   An ability ""fizzling"" is a pretty important failsafe in the ""cost: ability"" paradigm.   The keyword here is ""failsafe"". Once again you've failed to get to the why of the matter. Why is this important? Allow me to explain:  An ability fizzling out fixes an error in the game state by ending an unresolvable effect. That's why it's important, because it corrects unstable game states by overriding them. If it was a computer program it would be a way to exit a loop where the normal exit condition fails. But I've got news for you: you don't have to fix errors in the game state if you don't introduce them in the first place. Safeguards come before failsafes and one of the safeguards against this failsafe needing to be invoked is making actions that would introduce errors illegal. Feel free to correct me if I'm wrong (but I'm confident I'm not) but there are no examples in Netrunner where it's legal to use an ability (paying its cost) but it cannot at least partially resolve. If you use an SMC but can't find anything in your deck that you can install (or can afford to install) you have still partially resolved the ability (you've searched and shuffled your deck), you can play Diesel if there's only two cards in your stack as you can partially resolve it, but you can't use clone chip with nothing in your heap. There is nothing I can think of where you need to employ this failsafe.  But hey apparently you feel like you should be able to introduce an error into the game state to exploit a failsafe in order to undo an unfavourable position caused by either a sheer fluke of chance or your own poor deckbuilding. Why? Because the rule is bad? Why? Because you said so.  Give me a break."
Netrunner,3cicca,NotReallyFromTheUK,1 point,Sat Jul 11 00:44:38 2015 UTC,"Effects fizzling are an important part of any game where players aren't perfect.  I can guarantee you at least one player will trash a street peddler with three events on it, being unaware of the rule.  The sensible thing to do is just have the effect fizzle.  But in this case, either we must roll back the game state, even though information has already been revealed, or punish the player with a game loss.  Also, at this point you are arguing semantics.  None of what the arguments I gave amount to any less of a ""why"" than any of yours.    The key reason why we can have a paid cost with no effect but not a free effect with no paid cost is simply because of the order they happen in.  You do not resolve an ability and go back and pay the cost.  You pay the cost, in full, before the ability fires.  Now it's totally possible that the effect you paid for cannot be resolved.  If you really needed an analogy for this, I think you picked a flawed one.  This is the world of Netrunner.  It's dangerous and uncertain at all times.  Maybe you pay a guy up front to get you a piece of hardware, but he gets caught by the cops before he can deliver.  Your money is still gone and you get nothing in return.    This rule is unintuitive because it puts cause and effect out of order.  You have to first attempt to activate an ability, then evaluate all of the effects on the board that an ability would have.  Then, if it has none, you retroactively cannot pay the cost or activate the ability at all.    Allowing the player to attempt to activate an ability and fail is a simple extension of the current rule about partially resolvable effects that simplifies things greatly.  Instead of ""the player pays the cost, then resolves all parts of the ability that can be resolved, unless none of the abilities can be resolved, in which case the player cannot pay the cost,"" say ""the player pays the cost, then resolves all parts of the ability that can be resolved.""

So what... now you're arguing you should be able to cheat? If someone trashes their Peddler without knowing it's an illegal move then yes the sensible thing is to correct the game state and give the player a warning in the first instance (and this is where Netrunner needs a judge program and some proper tournament rules). But that is not your original argument, you were arguing that you should be able to do it deliberately. And if you do it deliberately while being fully aware of the rule that says you can't then you are cheating, no two ways about it.   Also, at this point you are arguing semantics. None of what the arguments I gave amount to any less of a ""why"" than any of yours.   No I'm not. The majority of your comments have been statements, not reasons. Try again. If you REALLY want me to I can repost every single one of your comments and highlight every statement you've made while pointing out where the argument is missing. And to use an example from your last comment to prove my point, you say the rule is unintuitive. Where exactly in that comment is anything explaining why it's unintuitive hm? I really hope that won't be necessary though.   The key reason why we can have a paid cost with no effect but not a free effect with no paid cost is simply because of the order they happen in. You do not resolve an ability and go back and pay the cost. You pay the cost, in full, before the ability fires.   Oh hey, this is actually an argument for a change. But how is paying the cost for an ability you can't resolve (even partially) different from resolving an ability that you can't pay the cost for in any way but the order? You are still executing one half of the equation without the other. That it's the left side rather than the right side is immaterial to this point.   Now it's totally possible that the effect you paid for cannot be resolved.   Actually as I've already pointed out it's not. I believe there are zero examples in Netrunner where you cannot at least partially resolve an ability you've paid the cost for. Again you are free to provide an example here but I really don't think you can find one. The only time you would have to fizzle an effect is if you make an illegal play. So no, not possible unless you are deliberately or accidentally ignoring the rules. Though I fail to see how this is actually even relevant to your original point. If anything this line of argument is self-defeating for you. You are arguing that effects fizzling is important to preserve the game state and yet your original point (well statement) is that the rule which prevents you ever needing to fix the game state is bad. So what you're fine with error correction mechanics but error prevention mechanics are garbage? Make up your mind.   If you really needed an analogy for this, I think you picked a flawed one. This is the world of Netrunner. It's dangerous and uncertain at all times. Maybe you pay a guy up front to get you a piece of hardware, but he gets caught by the cops before he can deliver. Your money is still gone and you get nothing in return.   My analogy was a purely mechanical one, theme has no place in a discussion on rules. Try again.   This rule is unintuitive because it puts cause and effect out of order. You have to first attempt to activate an ability, then evaluate all of the effects on the board that an ability would have. Then, if it has none, you retroactively cannot pay the cost or activate the ability at all.   No it doesn't. Evaluating the game state for legal plays does not change the order of cause and effect. Evaluation is not the same as resolution, never has been. You do not attempt to spend a click and draw a card from an empty stack before figuring out you can't do that and taking back your click. You know that's not a legal play just by looking at your stack. Similarly you know you cannot resolve the ability on Street Peddler when you see the cards hosted on it are all events. The order is: Evaluate, Execute, Resolve. Either way it is not intuitive to attempt to perform actions you already know you cannot do. It never has been, and I fail to see how you're ever going to produce a convincing argument otherwise. Why attempt to perform an action with no benefit? I'll ask again: is it intuitive to trash a clone chip with no programs in your heap? No? Exactly.   Allowing the player to attempt to activate an ability and fail is a simple extension of the current rule about partially resolvable effects that simplifies things greatly. Instead of ""the player pays the cost, then resolves all parts of the ability that can be resolved, unless none of the abilities can be resolved, in which case the player cannot pay the cost,"" say ""the player pays the cost, then resolves all parts of the ability that can be resolved."" It actually makes things simpler.   Does it actually though? As I've already pointed out that with the exception of fringe cases like Street Peddler and Geist potentially benefiting from costs being paid without their respective abilities resolved it's not intuitive to attempt to pay costs for abilities you cannot resolve. So how does removing a rule preventing unintuitive plays actually simplify things? Note that this rule has been in place for a while now and it's only now coming up with the release of this pack. It wasn't complicated before, it doesn't need to be simplified now. What benefit to the game does simplifying a rule that wasn't tripping people up previously offer? Changing the rules can actually make things more confusing as rule changes can take a while to flow down to players. The only justification for it would be if it made a significant difference to the flow of the game (like the ruling about additional costs and NAPD). But so far you just want it changed because it doesn't let you do something you think you should be able to. And that's really not a valid justification."
Netrunner,3cicca,NotReallyFromTheUK,1 point,Sat Jul 11 09:51:48 2015 UTC,"So what... now you're arguing you should be able to cheat?   You know that's not what I'm arguing.  Come on.  The issue is that deliberately doing something and accidentally doing something are not that different when secret information is involved.  For example, The Foundry's ability can be fired even when there isn't another copy of the ICE in the deck.  This is mainly important because if a player picks up their deck and looks through it, and finds that there isn't a copy of the card, the game state cannot be rolled back.  However, this also creates the perfectly legitimate strategy of rezzing ICE to shuffle after an Indexing run.  Similarly, when a player trashes Street Peddler in error, the events that were on it are revealed to the corp.  This means game state cannot be rolled back, as we cannot remove that knowledge from the corp player's brain."

And absent of them being given, as the poster CoolIdeasClub did not, if you have cards you absolutely cannot afford to be locked out, in a normal deck with a fair amount of events, you probably dont want to face that chance if you dont have to.  If you're not playing a lot of events or are playing a lot of rescursion or dont ABSOLUTELY need certain events so can afford to have them locked out, dont worry about it.

Netrunner,3cga6g,vampire0,5,Tue Jul 7 18:03:01 2015 UTC,"The problem in these cards is that the runner's best solution to the Corps' Ice you suggested is NOT to run Link, but to just break the Ice with their existing breaker suite.  Runner's currently control when the Corp can try and trace.  Fearing Midseasons?  Don't run.  Why play Link when you can simply play around Trace a lot of the time anyway?  They need to make Trace much MUCH more proactive from the Corp to force Runners into wasting deckspace on Link.  You need to know that you're getting traced 4/5/6 times per game, minimum, to make the investment in +2 link worthwhile for the credits you'll save on traces.  At the moment Link cards are your worst way to battle traces.  Just having icebreakers, lots of money, or timing your runs well are all better options."
Netrunner,3cga6g,satellite_uplink,1 point,Wed Jul 8 12:46:58 2015 UTC,"Exactly - that is why I'm proposing ice with more subroutines and those being trace - the runner won't want to break 3-4 subroutine ice frequently within a game, so link becomes an option to avoid the tax. If the Corp fears the Runner having link, they can run Trace boosting assets or switch back to non-trace ice."
Netrunner,3cga6g,satellite_uplink,2,Wed Jul 8 14:01:28 2015 UTC,"You need to offset the Trace element with very high strength, IMHO.  You've created Ice that costs the runner 2/3 credits to break, max.  Why on earth would they deviate from simply playing economy and breaking the Ice if it's that easy to break?  You've got look at above Gutenberg levels of Strength/Trace to really get runners taking Link seriously.  Lots of Strength, lots of subs."
Netrunner,3cga6g,satellite_uplink,1 point,Wed Jul 8 14:15:57 2015 UTC,"I think the problem with just making high-strength Tracer ice is that it removes Runner choice - if I can make a deck which is all Gutenburg-level strength, then the Runner can't realistically choose to break everything, or, more specifically, must job through a huge number of hoops to get breakers that can do so efficiently. Adding subs though, for the majority of breakers, adds a simple 1-1 cost increase between breaking and not breaking the routine. In other words, its easier to scale.  The other side of things is that a high-strength, high-trace pattern for Tracers would mean that their effects would have to be limited- Gutenburg works because removing a tag is easy (or can be ignored) - you couldn't have something like say, a trash routine on an Ice with similar strength and trace values (at least not without making the Ice cost like 10+ credits)."
Netrunner,3cga6g,raydenuni,3,Wed Jul 8 16:01:33 2015 UTC,"But isn't that the whole point?  If the runner can choose to use their existing resources to avoid a trace then why do they need to play a specific card to deal with it?  You need traces that CAN'T be easily solved by icebreakers or simply outmuscling them with credits, if you want to drive runners into using Link."
Netrunner,3cga6g,satellite_uplink,1 point,Wed Jul 8 16:12:25 2015 UTC,"I think the problem here is that you're looking for Ice that forces the trace - I'm looking for ice that encourages the trace.   Imagine that you have a piece of ice with 10 strength and 1 trace subroutine - in that case you've pretty much forced the Runner to choose trace as matching a 10 is going to cost more than the Trace even if the Runner has to put 7-8 credits into it. If you have a 0 strength with 10 trace 1 subs then we've reached the point where we force Link - you can't afford to break all of them for 10c when +1 link makes it free.   What we need is to find the sweet spot in between where there is ice that is possible to break but is more taxing than what we have today to those relying on breaking but cheaper to those relying who have +Link. Then it becomes a balance in the meta - if no one is running +Link, run more of those ice and gain advantage for being taxing. If everyone is running +Link shift back to more normal ice to remove their advantage."
Netrunner,3cga6g,raydenuni,1 point,Wed Jul 8 17:38:37 2015 UTC,"Yep. If the cost to avoid traces is low enough, then the solution to more traces is ""more money that can be used to break ice"", not Link.  I'm not sure the only solution is higher strength, although it's certainly an options. More subroutines works as well. What would encourage more link?  A 5 str ice with one subroutine of trace 2 -> give the corp 1 credit  OR  A 1 str ice with 3 subroutines of trace 2 -> give the corp 1 credit  ?"
Netrunner,3cga6g,kgb613,2,Wed Jul 8 18:37:04 2015 UTC,"Neither of those would encourage the runner to play link, partly because they're both so bad that no Corp would ever use them.  You need a card that has an effect powerful enough for the Corp to want to play it, on an Ice tough enough that the Runner doesn't want to break it.  I know where you're going but look at Caduceus/Viper, which are examples of where FFG have tried to makes Trace/Link matter outside of Tags and it just gets treated as ETR Ice and broken.  They've revisited it would Sagittarius/Taurus etc now but it's swung the other way, with the Cost/Benefit too low for the Corp to really play them (pay 5 to rez, then spunk more money on a trace... to deal a net damage.  Wow gee, I wonder why nobody is using this over Cortex Lock).  Ultimately it's tough to push Trace via Ice because runners can ignore Ice.  Unless you're going to run the trace on encounter..."
Netrunner,3cga6g,theg2,1 point,Thu Jul 9 08:32:03 2015 UTC,"I wasn't trying to design competitive ice, just compare the two approaches. I think building traces with very strong binary states is the wrong way to go about it. If you make it really bad for the trace to go off, then the runner will probably just break the subroutine to avoid the chance of the trace going off. More, lighter penalty traces is the answer for link. Link doesn't help you beat really high strength traces. If there's only one trace 6 that goes off the whole game, each link is only worth 1 credit. But if you have 15 2 strength traces that go off in a game, a link is worth 15 credits.  So make an ice with five subroutines of trace 2. Link is PHENOMENAL against that. The goal is to make it cheaper to fight the traces if you have link, than to break the subroutines. You can do this by either making the ice crazy strong, which is definitely an option, or having lots of traces. Making the consequences of not breaking the trace isn't a factor here in my opinion. It's always been more expensive for runners to break lots of subroutines than to break a stronger ice with a single subroutine. It's why stuff like Komainu and Tusurugi are so taxing. Even if you have strong icebreakers, you still have to pay for each subroutine. No way around that.  Increasing the subroutines that trace makes it more expensive to break and more cheap the more link you have."
Netrunner,3cga6g,kgb613,5,Thu Jul 9 15:20:46 2015 UTC,"I think that there are two things that could benefit both sides of the fence. First, I think that there should be an untyped ICE that initiates mid-range traces. Take for example:  Carnivore  ICE: Mythic - Primordial - Tracer - Rez 3 - Str 2 - Inf 1  ↳ Trace 4 - Place one power counter on Carnivore.  ↳ Trace 2 - Do 1 Net Damage for every power counter on Carnivore.  Herbivore  ICE: Mythic - Primordial - Tracer - Rez 2 - Str 1 - Inf 1  ↳ Trace 5 - Place one power counter on Herbivore.  ↳ Trace 3 - The Corp gains 1credit for every power counter on Herbivore.  Omnivore  ICE: Mythic - Primordial - Tracer - Rez 6 - Str 2 - Inf 2  ↳ Trace 3 - Place one power counter on Omnivore.  ↳ Trace 3 - Do 1 Net Damage for every power counter on Omnivore.  ↳ Trace 3 - The Corp gains 1credit for every power counter on Omnivore.  This at least creates a scenario where it is far less likely that the runner will be prepared for a trace.  On the runner side, I think it'd be interesting if there was a breaker that was decent, but then amazing if your link was high enough.  Again, as an example:  Beholder (Anarch)  Program: Icebreaker - Killer - Install - 5 - Str - 2 - Inf - 2  2credit (or 0credit if the Runner has 6 link): +1 Strength.  1 credit: Break sentry subroutine.  Trash Beholder if you lose a trace.  EDIT: Formatting."
Netrunner,3cga6g,kgb613,3,Wed Jul 8 03:20:49 2015 UTC,I love that ICE idea and would love to see more Mythic ice.
Netrunner,3cga6g,neutronicus,1 point,Wed Jul 8 13:18:49 2015 UTC,"I like these ideas - I think in the case of all three Ice though, the Runner will just choose to pay 1-2 credits to break the affect making routines and ignore the power counter ones.  For Beholder, my first thought was ""wow that is strong"" but maybe its not as horrible as I thought - in the end Morningstar breaks 5 str Barriers for 1 credit, and this would break any Sentry for 1 credit per routine but needs a lot of setup. Good idea :)"
Netrunner,3cga6g,kgb613,2,Wed Jul 8 17:25:53 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the feedback! It's a really interesting puzzle.  As far as the ICE, I still think it isn't that easy. I mean, you need an AI breaker, Gingerbread or the SMC/CC-to-parasite combo to get past it without paying that tax every time. If they blow the parasite on this ICE, it keeps your Binary ICE safe as well. Also, remember that if the Corp rezzes these when it wants to, it can catch the runner off guard when he can't beat that trace. Now that power counter is going nowhere and it becomes a significant problem.  I also debated making it ""place a counter on a piece of Primordial ICE"" which might work better.  Either way, fun exercise."
Netrunner,3cga6g,RogueCarpet,2,Wed Jul 8 17:36:51 2015 UTC,"Duh, I should pay attention to the fact its Mythic - in that case the Traces might be a little oppressive. Definitely better that way though - basically its punishing for those that don't have AI/Ice destruction.  Cool :)"

The main thing is most face-checks will slam right into it, which makes traces more viable."
Netrunner,3cga6g,the-_-hatman,4,Wed Jul 8 16:53:32 2015 UTC,"I think the problem isn't really on the Runner side, it's more on the Corp side. Corps have no reason to run cards with Traces since they're pretty weak in general. Trace1 is awful against Andy/Kate, and boosting traces generally favors the Runner since they have better economy options. It isn't too surprising the only traces we regularly see are Midseasons and SEA Source which tend to end the game if they land.  If we give Runners cards that support Link then we'll just see even less play of Traces since more Runners will be using Link.  I think you also need to make more viable traces on the Corp side (e.g. more non-binary traces like Midseasons)."
Netrunner,3cga6g,RS14-2,2,Tue Jul 7 18:28:59 2015 UTC,"I get what you're saying about Trace 1...

That makes it more of a sliding scale."

Netrunner,3cga6g,Lluluien,2,Wed Jul 8 15:56:52 2015 UTC,"The problem is that Data Hound at 2 Strength is too cheap to break for even its 1 credit cost to justify, particularly when the current ice-spread incentivizes playing Mimic in every deck possible. Its fine against just about every other Sentry breaker in the game either by break cost or install vs rez costs.  If the meta shifts, then Data Hound might actually be OK, if not ""good""."

Netrunner,3cga6g,-dr00-,2,Wed Jul 8 19:29:34 2015 UTC,"We've already seen some efforts to help traces on the Corp side: Midseasons-type traces that get better the more you ""win"", and Taurus-type traces that go off if you spend a certain amount of credits. There are a few other dimensions that we could play around with, like how much the runner spends or whether the runner (or corp!) spends anything at all, but that's basically what we're working with.  It seems to me that binary traces should include things that couldn't be standard subroutines. We've already seen this in Shinobi (1 hit KO) and Ash (stopping accesses), maybe we could see more of it in other cards."
Netrunner,3cga6g,GrandLarcen,1 point,Tue Jul 7 21:26:32 2015 UTC,"The Taurus affect is interesting, but I think its just another mechanic that further incentivizes the Runner to break the routine instead of trying the Trace - normally if you beat a Trace you avoid all of the penalty, but with Taurus you still take a penalty even if you ""win"" the trace.  In order for Trace / Link to be a healthy mechanic there have to be situations where the Runner finds it at least cuts even on a risk v reward ration to invest in Link instead of more breakers/money - Taurus seems to push completely in the opposite direction.  Also, the ""Taurus"" mechanic isn't strong in-and-of itself - the other three ""constellation"" ice don't really see play even though they rely on the same mechanic, even though most of them are stronger or cheaper to rez."
Netrunner,3cga6g,BoomFrog,2,Wed Jul 8 17:20:16 2015 UTC,"I'd say the mechanic's got good returns for the corp; Sagitarius would be amazing if it were ever played. The other two are kind of silly, mostly because they don't give a good enough reward for success. (A net damage? A tag? PLEASE.) Tracing is disadvantageous for the Corp, so if they're going to win a trace, it'd better be worth it.  I think you're seeing it from a Runner point of view, which is fine. Basically, we've got a few more parameters we could try, like ""Trace2 : If successful, (BAD THING). If the runner spends 2 credit or more, gain 2credit."" This would reward link or just straight breaking the sub. Basically, we're always going to be incentivizing breaking subroutines, because you don't want them to trigger. Trace adds an additional lever for runners to pull. I'd like to see more high-STR, low base trace strength ice--that would likely fill your requirements. But, as of now, that's not going to happen, unless the traces are like Shinobi and can just win you the game."
Netrunner,3cga6g,Lluluien,2,Wed Jul 8 17:57:48 2015 UTC,"Yeah, you've hit the nail on the head - if we make the routine too weak the Corp wont care if it lands so they wont run it - too much of a draw back and they wont either.  Good feed back."
Netrunner,3cga6g,Lluluien,3,Wed Jul 8 18:51:35 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't play any of those ice. The traces are just a 1c tax on each, except maybe Credit Check which could be worth forcing through very occasionally, and they occasionally gets randomly hosed if you're playing against Kate, Andy, or a few other runners.    The fundamental problem with runner link-matters cards is that their existence discourages corps from using tracers at all. Why put Viper or Caduceus in your deck if even 10% of the meta is Siphon Worm/Underworld Contact Andy running Hound?   It's like printing another Yog.0 that doubles as economy. Why would anyone run low-strength Code Gates ever?"
Netrunner,3cga6g,Lluluien,1 point,Tue Jul 7 18:29:59 2015 UTC,"That is why Hound cost 2 credits per routine - its no more efficient than Darwin.

I mean, the reason people break Trace Routines now is that it is usually cheaper than the trace, or even if its not, the cost of loosing the trace is too high compared to breaking it. Look at Burke Bugs - no one is ever going to let that fire because even if they have 5 link, the Corp getting the option to pay money to trash a program is too good."
Netrunner,3cga6g,BoomFrog,1 point,Tue Jul 7 18:44:16 2015 UTC,"That is why Hound cost 2 credits per routine - its no more efficient than Darwin.   You've missed the point. It's not about whether or not the individual runner cards you've suggested are too good. It's that if this sort of card is good enough to see significant play, then corps will stop running trace ice entirely.    Also... maybe this didn't come out well in the same cards, but the idea was that if Ice mixed useful routines (like those we see on Ice Wall) with minor trace routines that most Runner's wouldn't want to pay to break all of the time, but would drive some benefit to the Corp (the idea behind Credit Check)?   Credit Check is actually okay. You pay a 1c premium over ice wall for the ability to sometimes rez it and pay a bunch to trash their loaded Kati or Liberated Accounts or whatever. I guess it's a bit like Snatch and Grab, but it can be broken with a Fracter and doesn't take up a deck slot. Fine.   Ichi 1.0 is another piece of ice that does this well.  The problem with the other two is that there's no reason to ever boost the trace. The effect just isn't enough to justify the corp spending money on them. So they're effects that the runner will pay 1c to beat, probably, unless they're Kate or Andy, in which case they're blank.    Look at Burke Bugs - no one is ever going to let that fire because even if they have 5 link, the Corp getting the option to pay money to trash a program is too good.    Shit, if I've got money there are plenty of times I'd happily let Burke Bugs fire, even without any link. If they want to pay 10c to trash a program of my choice, they can probably have it. Or maybe they don't spend much and I'll just match the trace; that's fine too. Burke Bugs is terrible because it lets the runner choose their favorite of three different outcomes, none of which are all that bad."
Netrunner,3cga6g,JohnQK,2,Tue Jul 7 19:21:04 2015 UTC,"Burke Bugs is terrible because it lets the runner choose their favorite of three different outcomes, none of which are all that bad.   That's the problem with most trace ICE in the game.  The extra 1-2 strength or -1/-2 rez cost for the purposes of giving your ICE one more vulnerability isn't worth it because the Runner gets to choose which vulnerability is the most convenient for him to exploit at the time.  The base trace strength of almost all trace ICE subroutines in the game except the most recent ones like Gutenburg are far, far too low to make them worth this vulnerability."
Netrunner,3cga6g,WolfOne,1 point,Wed Jul 8 17:15:00 2015 UTC,"Fair point about my other two examples - maybe Credit Check was the only one that really did what I was trying to invoke.  As for the others where the corp wont pay or they are blank... I think it might be a little more grey then that, but I get your point. The problem is that there is no mid-ground between a Trace 1 where the Runner with 1 link views it as blank (unless the Corp pays) and a Trace 2 where the Corp doesn't need to pay to make the Runner pay 1-2 credits and it becomes cheaper to break the ice. I think this is why FFG is now printing tons of cheap, high strength Trace ice (Checkpoint, Gutenburg, etc) because in order to get the runner to even attempt to use the trace you have to make the ice nearly unbreakable.  Maybe Troll like effects where the trace can't be circumvented by breaking?"
Netrunner,3cga6g,sigma83,4,Tue Jul 7 20:29:15 2015 UTC,"imo, most complaints about trace will be moot after Data & Destiny.  Sunny Lebaeu's faction i suspect will support a lot of link cards for runners and have boosts for having link, and for the corp side, Surveillance Sweep will completely change traces and make even a trace 1 useful if the runner can't break it normally.  if you want traces to be meaningful, adding more ICE with trace subroutines is not the way to go.  tracing needs more:  effects like Midseasons, Power Grid Overload, or Data Hound, where the difference in the totals (not just one being higher) makes a difference in the effect.  more on-encounter traces on ICE like TMI or Information Overload.  TMI can sometimes be more taxing for the corp, and honestly, that's why i love that ICE so much.  the trace is meaningful and has an adverse effect for both player depending on how it goes.  and IO can add subroutines right away if it lands a tag.  this design space could probably be explored a bit more though.  overall higher base traces like Gutenburg  more asset-based tracing effects like Broadcast Square or Primary Transmission Disc.  these hardly ever see play because they aren't very good and/or are too situational.  this design space needs to be explored a lot more imo.  the only area where traces are really important right now are in operations.  SEA Source, Midseasons, Punitive Counterstrike, Snatch and Grab, etc. are all great.  things like Foxfire.... no, but i think that's in a good direction (ie: high trace effects with small uses, like Foxfire's trashing of virtual resources)"
Netrunner,3cga6g,WolfOne,0,Wed Jul 8 06:55:20 2015 UTC,"See, I completely disagree with you and think the things you cite as good are exactly what is wrong with traces - TMI a sucks because you don't reliably get a benefit from it, so no one runs it competitively - it's more efficient to pay 1 more credit for a Bastion to know you'll never fail a trace. Cards like Data Hound and Gutenburg are interesting, but Data Hound is too easy to break, so Corps won't ever really choose the trace over 1 credit to break, and with Gutenburg the trace is so high your choice is basically the same as breaking it, so it's cheaper to just take the tag and remove it after the run.  Assets that boost trace will continue to suck until they find someway to make tracing good - until then it's just giving you money for something that will never happen - that is why I'm advocating adding more of them at lower starting strength - running these assets would keep 1 link runners from walking though the routines, but at the cost of deck space - it because a corp deck space choice again vs a non-choice like today,  The operations you cite are good only cause they are a money-fight on the corps terms - they don't even really need to be traces - no one ever boosts them with trace credits or anything."

Netrunner,3cga6g,raydenuni,3,Wed Jul 8 13:58:33 2015 UTC,"I'm hoping/betting that Data and Destiny will include some cards that do interesting things with link, in Sunny LeBeau's mini-faction. Since her only power is having 2 link to start, sure she'll be able to use the cloud breakers off the bat. But what about cards that require 3 or 4 link to turn on? Or cards with X effects, where X is equal to your link? Or cards where SHE can initiate a trace to win an effect.  On the side of current runners, she seems to be most likely to have cards that make sense to spend influence on in the standard factions (since a lot of Adam and Apex's cards may not work effectively, or at all, with a regular runner), and some of those cards may be good enough to make link desirable in a ""regular"" runner deck."

Netrunner,3cga6g,WolfOne,3,Tue Jul 7 20:22:38 2015 UTC,The problem with most trace cards and indeed the cards you propose for the corp are that the traces are too low. Runners IDs got one free link way too easily on several runners and basically that's the default now.  You have to assume your opponent has one link. I would never put a card with trace 1 in a deck since it is blank verses more than 50% of my opponents.
Netrunner,3cga6g,WolfOne,1 point,Wed Jul 8 12:33:24 2015 UTC,"right, but trace 2 is just too much for 0 link runners to consider paying - its chapter to break them in all cases. Lots of people are focusing on this and I don't get it - if the Runner breaks it, the extra routine was an average 1c tax - if they don't then you have the option to pay in - not something you want to do often but at least you have a choice, and if you are talking about something like a sub to make the runner loose a credit - either they break it for one or you can pay one to make them need to send one to beat he race or loose the 1 any way - that could be game breaking, as we all know (especially if the Corp is doing it for free off of a trace booster). 1-2 more credits of tax per run be a huge difference."
Netrunner,3cga6g,X-factor103,2,Wed Jul 8 14:07:09 2015 UTC,"They're focusing on it because if the Runner has 1 link, they don't break it; Corp doesn't spend money because the subroutine is weak, they have enough natural link to counter it because they're playing Kate, and the subroutine does nothing even though it wasn't broken.  The routines are essentially being broken for 0 credits.  Furthermore, if you're going to include weak ICE that only serves as a 1c tax on the Runner after the first few turns, we have way better options for that.  Those kinds of ICE are best used as an early gear check, and if you want a gear check, ETR routines or a really hideous early routine like Cortex Lock work far better.  I don't think people are misinterpreting your goal here; these ICE are just too weak to replace current contenders for their particular deck slots."
Netrunner,3cga6g,Lluluien,1 point,Wed Jul 8 17:24:36 2015 UTC,What about ice that is of similar power level to existing ice but has more weak traces in addition to the other routines? That would make it stronger against breaker-dependent runners but weaker against Link based runners.
Netrunner,3cga6g,Lluluien,2,Wed Jul 8 18:33:44 2015 UTC,"Let's pretend we have some kind of Enigma + Viper jabberwocky where the ICE is exactly the same as Enigma except it has one additional Viper-like subroutine where we run a Trace 1 to remove a second click from the Runner.  In this case, Enigmawocky is obviously the better ICE, because we've just tacked on an additional power, however weak.  But that's power creep.  Somewhere in between what you suggested and Enigmawocky might be a card that is well-tuned enough to include in a deck with slightly more power than Enigma when the traces fire but slightly less power when they don't.  That really seems to be what you're aiming for in the striation of ICE that you chose to build around in your original question (the weaker, early game variety).  I would say, though, that your last sentence:   That would make it stronger against breaker-dependent runners but weaker against Link based runners.   gives you its own guidance as where you should be looking at in the design space if you want players to include a new Corp card in their decks of this type.    I do think that making an ICE that is stronger vs. breakers but weaker vs Link would be a good place to take the design you're looking for because Corps would play that card right now.  However, when you're talking about early-game ICE, most of the goal of that ICE has been to say ""Does Runner have X breaker installed? (Yes/No)"".  I think it's going to be hard to make a reasonably powerful and reasonably interesting card in this vein based on your suggestion of taking an existing ICE and tweaking it by adding weak traces, if the goal is to make it stronger vs ICEbreakers.  I think you're better off looking at mid- or end-game ICE to do this, where simply having the correct ICEbreaker installed doesn't automatically make you win.  Ichi 1.0, again, is a good example of this.  That being said...  What about an early game ICE that's actually a jabberwocky of Wraparound and Viper instead of Enigma?  Wrapawocky  Neutral Code Gate  Strength 0  Rez 3  This ICE gains 7 strength if the Runner has no Fracter installed.  Trace 3: Runner loses [click], if able.  Trace 3: End the Run  This definitely makes it stronger vs. breakers.  You have to have TWO types of breakers out to break it without the cost being prohibitive, but once you have a Fracter and a Decoder/AI, the cost to break it is just about as trivial as you can make it since it's strength 0.  Strength bonus and rez cost could be tweaked as necessary, but this accomplishes what you're after.  This is a very good ICE against 0 or 1 link, but the cost has reached its breaker-trivial point at 2 link and it's junk at 3 link."

It's not a major boost, but it's on par with little benefits like  increased hand size or decreased deck size.   Putting traces on Ice doesn't really do much. No competent runner is running blindly into Ice without the appropriate breaker or means to fetch them. Every subroutine in the game might as well read ""the runner pays 1 credit.""  There are some times, especially when you've got a nice high link, that you may opt to let a trace fire because it's cheaper than breaking it. Outside of that, though, it doesn't do much on Ice.  I do like seeing more things that use link. Underworld Contacts, after all, is an awesome card and almost a necessity when using an ID that has a natural link. I think that your idea for Siphon Worm is also a great idea for a card."
Netrunner,3cga6g,DacianFalx7,3,Tue Jul 7 18:17:30 2015 UTC,"I think your point about ""the runner plays 1"" is exactly spot on - the idea here is that if you stack these minor traces on enough ice then the Runner has a choice - pay 1 each time on lots of ice, or put a a few + Link cards in their deck. Right now the Runner just has too many down-sides for loosing a trace and too few traces encountered, so the easier path is to just break the routine. Putting more and less powerful traces out there also adds a choice when encountering that trace - does the Corp pay money into it to gain a minor benefit, or do they let let the Runner get away with it for free?"
Netrunner,3cga6g,DacianFalx7,2,Tue Jul 7 18:24:23 2015 UTC,"I think you are missing one crucial detail though. Why would the corp build a deck to stack cheap traces when it's already easy to stack cheap ""hard"" subroutines? It doesn't really make sense."

Netrunner,3cga6g,DacianFalx7,2,Wed Jul 8 09:14:30 2015 UTC,"No, tracers are cheaper to rez but their effect is not cheaper because often you have to spend money on it, expecially if the trace STR is low, it will often just be a trade in credits and you won't see effects.   If your reasoning was true, everybody would play TMI but nobody does because it's very hard to rez. Draco is another example. It's extremely competitively costed but nobody plays it anymore because it requires a kind of complete economic dominance that just doesn't happen. Caduceus is probably the best Trace Ice but only because it's always good whether it gets broken or the trace lands and the traces feed into each other and sometimes you can rez it for free."
Netrunner,3cga6g,MasterAir,3,Wed Jul 8 09:32:02 2015 UTC,I agree with you. Since the beginning I've felt that the minimum value for any Trace needed to be 4 or 5 to make it worth running. Low Trace ICE/cards are almost reverse traps for the corp =/
Netrunner,3cga6g,SparklingEmoWendigo,1 point,Wed Jul 8 13:15:08 2015 UTC,"Yeah that's it. The trace value needs to be AT LEAST one point higher than the rez cost, if not two."
Netrunner,3cga6g,neutronicus,1 point,Wed Jul 8 13:27:05 2015 UTC,Ice with low value traces wouldn't be so bad if several of them went off. This would also make link more valuable.

Netrunner,3cga6g,FricasseeToo,1 point,Wed Jul 8 13:09:06 2015 UTC,"That's why I'm suggesting that Ice needs to mix the two - solid routines and trace routines so that over all the number of routines on ice go up to the point where it would be more taxing to Runners to break everything, incentivizing them to find some way to avoid breaking them all, visa vi Link boost so they can afford not to break every trace.  Why would a Corp not run ice with more routines ( Trace or not)? That's a 1 credit tax per run per tracer routine the Runner wants to break. If we print more ice with more routines (which are traces) then the runner is going to have to shift their deck to offset the cost somehow."
Netrunner,3cga6g,jtobiasbond,1 point,Wed Jul 8 11:23:09 2015 UTC,"On an abstract point of view I agree that more subroutines are better, but the quality of a subroutine matters a lot.   You see Enigma much much more than Viper, because Enigma can protect an early agenda while Viper cannot.   Ice taxes both the runner's credits AND its gear. Trace ice taxes your credits first and then the runner's because of the rule requiring the corp to spend first.   If the runner has more credits than you, it's suboptimal to spend money on a trace the runner could let the trace hit and deal with it while having made you poor. That's why caduceus is so good, because it has a built-in refund for your expense. The only way traces will become more prevalent is with the new NBN current that was spoiled from Data and Destiny."
Netrunner,3cga6g,Xenasis,1 point,Wed Jul 8 11:49:33 2015 UTC,"I'm also looking forward to D&D, hopefully it has some answers.  I'm also suggesting that we mix in normal and trace routines - Shadow in the Core does this, and my proposed Credit Check does this as well - that means the Runner still needs their breakers, but one they do they have a choice of how to pay for things - deal with more subroutines by paying to break or more by boosting Link."
Netrunner,3cga6g,Lluluien,1 point,Wed Jul 8 14:11:24 2015 UTC,"What i'm trying to say is that I, as a Corp, don't really want to give a runner choices. I don't want him to be able to get out of nasty effects by just paying a trace, I want him both to pay AND to need a specific card to solve the situation. I want to give him problems.   The harder the problems I give the runner the happier I am.  Having the runner pay first for any trace would be an EXCELLENT problem for me to give to the runner for example."
Netrunner,3cga6g,rumirumirumirumi,3,Wed Jul 8 16:10:59 2015 UTC,"Agree here. The difference between 1 of something and none of it is surprisingly big in this game. Andy/Kate's native 1 link is surprisingly useful compared to EVERY other runner who gets nothing, especially early game when a few extra credits go a long way and I don't want to spend them on traces.  I think the OP has a point though that design space is all that's really key. if we saw more good traces happening, link would be way more valuable.  The counter argument right now is ""why have link cards when you can have cards that make you cash?"" You make money that can be used on traces or other stuff. That argument would fall apart if traces were so much more common that the recurring tax would warrant link over straight money. I wouldn't mind if we saw more good trace ICE or link-based abilities, for one."
Netrunner,3cga6g,rumirumirumirumi,1 point,Tue Jul 7 19:34:41 2015 UTC,"The problem with that one starting link is that those Runners are so good anyway that they already see play.  Therefore, if you really want to make repeated tracing meaningful to the Corp (which is the only way link is meaningful - for one or two really large traces like come out of Midseasons, link doesn't really help you), then the base trace strength has to be high enough that it's still meaningful vs the 1-link Runners.  It doesn't seem like that's going to happen because every time we have this conversation, everyone wants to suggest fixes that have base trace strengths that are too low.  Keep in mind tracing is a WEAKNESS of a Corp card unless it's offset by another advantage somewhere else on the card.  Trace gives the Runner one ADDITIONAL way to deal with a card; all the rest of the standard tricks still apply.   OP is a good example.  All those traces on ICE starting with base strength one?  They're too weak to be meaningful because Kate (among a few other Runners) beat them by default for free.  If the Runner paid first by default, the conversation would be different, and I know there's a card for that in Data & Destiny, but now you're in combo-land, have to defend an asset, have to have the deck space, yadda yadda same problem that all trace boosting cards for Corp have always had since Genesis/Spin cycles."
Netrunner,3cga6g,Xenasis,1 point,Wed Jul 8 16:42:54 2015 UTC,Do you have a suggested solution though? Most of the posts here are focusing on high str/trace ice being the only option - that seems like a really limited design space.
Netrunner,3cga6g,Xenasis,2,Wed Jul 8 17:42:05 2015 UTC,"Personally, I see the biggest problem with including Trace cards as the Corp is that their deck space is too limited to include many cards that are completely invalidated by some set of Runner tech.  For instance, Yog is common enough that while many Corp decks will run either Enigma or Quandry, they won't run both.  Furthermore, if you're already planning on including either one of those cards, you probably don't have enough room to run some other piece of tracing ICE that might be great for some Runners but terrible for other ones (unless this is a meta-hate decision, but the Runners [Kate] that needs hated out of the meta right now are ones with link anyway).  If we accept that this is a problem, then I think the best example we have for the way forward is Ichi 1.0.  That card does something useful enough to include him in decks even if his last subroutine almost never does anything.  The fact that the last subroutine is there gives you one more opportunity to hurt the Runner, similar to what you're trying to accomplish with your ICE suggestions, but the difference is his other routines will sometimes get him included in a deck regardless of whether or not the Corp thinks the trace routine might ever be useful.  The Corp needs more trace cards like that: things they can put in their deck where the card isn't completely obviated by the trace portion of it being made irrelevant.  If the trace routine is strong enough, then a low base strength might be fine because it encourages the Corp to spend on it.  If the trace strength is high enough, then the trace routine can be weak-but-annoying, so the Runner feels harried by having to either repeatedly pay or repeatedly suffer the annoyance.  In either of these cases, the best play for the Runner is still to fight them with money unless it's something that's repeatedly applied - that's where link really becomes relevant.  For that reason, I think the best application for designing a card like this can't be a non-current operation; it's got to be something with more permanence for the Corp:  ICE, Currents, Assets, Agendas, etc.  ICE is really the best candidate, I think, because you're forced to include it in your deck anyway and are already encouraged by several aspects of the existing rules/cards to have various kinds of it.  Some decks won't want assets, each Agenda only works for 1/4 of the Corp factions, Currents run afoul of the deck-space problem for Corps already (though even having a blank current in your deck has some value [namely that they can cancel enemy Currents], so in fairness these do have a natural value of the sort which I am suggesting for designing tracers)."
Netrunner,3cga6g,FricasseeToo,1 point,Wed Jul 8 18:10:56 2015 UTC,Very well said - I think you've identified the same sort of design space I was thinking about. I should have cited Ichi 1.0 in the original article.
Netrunner,3cga6g,Xenasis,4,Wed Jul 8 19:01:57 2015 UTC,"Also, I really really disagree with the idea that Link is on-par with hand size. Imagine if you had a Rabbit Hole like card that boosted hand-size or a version of Andy that had 0 link but a 40 card deck size... that would be insane. At best, Link is worth like half or less of that those abilities and it doesn't really scale - having 1 link isn't really better than having 0 and having 3 isn't really better than 2 - 2 is only good cause its the trigger point for Cloudbreakers and Underworld Contacts."
Netrunner,3cga6g,FricasseeToo,3,Tue Jul 7 18:46:46 2015 UTC,"Link ... doesn't really scale   I'm about to get off lunch break and back to work so I won't bother with the detailed analysis, but I'm guessing that trace strengths follow a power law: lots of 1s, some 2s, and 3+s rarely.  I prefer to think about most NR situations in terms of differential analysis. Corps rarely bother boosting traces they're distinctly disadvantaged on; pay two to make a runner spend one seems like a bad deal. In that framework, every link runner plays shifts the differential of towards their favor. At the same time, winning Runners winning trace by 1 or by 3 doesn't affect the game state.  So rather, I think trace doesn't scale linearly. 1 trace really is better than 0 link, but every increment up in link returns less and less. The 2 link trigger cards add a nice non-linear spike to further confound things."
Netrunner,3cga6g,Xenasis,2,Tue Jul 7 20:40:28 2015 UTC,"Very good points about the scaling. Its interesting too cause its not just Link vs Base Trace, its also based on the value of the routine - if its a crappy routine then even a high trace doesn't matter all the that much - in other words if there isn't incentive to pay for the trace, then a trace of 1 or 100 doesn't make a difference to the runner any more than Link 2 or 200 matters against a Trace 1."
Netrunner,3cga6g,tetristhemovie,2,Tue Jul 7 20:53:42 2015 UTC,"Underworld Contacts, after all, is an awesome card and almost a necessity when using an ID that has a natural link.   Hmmm.

Netrunner,3cga6g,xanarax,3,Wed Jul 8 16:43:05 2015 UTC,"+1 for some good ideas and food for thought.  Some of your card designs are neat, but I think trace 1 cards will have a hard time seeing adoption just because Kate and Andy have a starting link (which I'm sure is something Lucas regrets doing). Likewise, any card that benefits link strength will disproportionately benefit those already-over-represented runner IDs. It's a shame, but I really do think that's the single thing that's preventing them from better exploring the design space around link."
Netrunner,3cga6g,Tyleulenspiegel,1 point,Tue Jul 7 23:22:07 2015 UTC,"Do we think that will be a problem in the future though - Andy will rotate and while Kate will be with us forever, I really think that we will see something before long that kicks PPvP Kate in the face hard enough that it is just one of many decks (that, or I'll find a new game to play any way).  I kind of feel like this argument is stuck in a defeatist chicken-or-the-egg problem. No one likes the way Trace & Link are playing out now, but the best suggestions I've seen from others are to keep doing what we're doing now."
Netrunner,3cga6g,firefrenchy,2,Wed Jul 8 17:10:45 2015 UTC,"Mechanically I think Link works fine.  Ideally I'd like more cards that give me Link while doing other things as well (hello The Helpful AI) because I often find it hard to justify including cards that ""only"" give me Link when I'm already trying to make a deck as lean as possible.  Usually if I include Link at all then it's a set of Rabbit Holes so I don't end up drawing effectively dead +1 Link cards late in the game."
Netrunner,3cga6g,SmilingGak,1 point,Tue Jul 7 18:23:42 2015 UTC,But what if the Corp was running enough traces that the Link in and of itself was useful? Right now Link is kind of a throw away bonus - the other bonus on the card is the more important one (unless you are shooting for 2 link to start up Underworld Contacts).
Netrunner,3cga6g,neutronicus,1 point,Tue Jul 7 18:31:05 2015 UTC,I see your point but I'm afraid I don't see an easy solution.  No Corp will run lots of little-trace ICE because it's near useless against Runners with natural Link and unreliable the rest of the time.    Maybe once Data & Destiny comes out they'll add a few Trace/Link tricks like Surveillance Sweep which could shake things up a bit.
Netrunner,3cga6g,SmilingGak,1 point,Tue Jul 7 18:38:19 2015 UTC,That is why my idea was to pair them onto other affects - Sniffer isn't that useful I guess but the Credit Check is still a 2 credit ETR ice and Quantum Sai still a 1 credit Net damage routine - people run Ice Wall & Yagura today and neither of them is much more than that.
Netrunner,3cga6g,SmilingGak,2,Tue Jul 7 18:40:09 2015 UTC,"I think we have more or less the same idea here except that I'm coming at it from the Runner side of making including a little Link more attractive and you're looking at the Corp side of making Trace more prevalent, both by pairing the mechanic with other things the player finds valuable.  In my opinion it's better from the Runner half because good, versatile defensive options are always considered for inclusion but low-strength Traces (especially in a meta where inherent-Link Runners like Kate and Andy turn up a lot) are too easily dealt with already so most Corps would rather run reliable defenses rather than Trace-flooding and hoping some work."
Netrunner,3cga6g,Horse625,1 point,Tue Jul 7 18:54:38 2015 UTC,"Thats a good point, design wise. Its interesting, as while we currently don't view Link and Traces as a strong mechanic, attempting to make them stronger would reward already strong IDs that were given extra link specifically because it wasn't strong. Honestly, it means we're in a space where the only options are to abandon trace entirely (which sucks cause its very flavorful), know that Trace is a rubbish mechanic (which sucks cause a core ID is built on it), or bump up Traces and errata or ban IDs with link bonuses and strong abilities (which sucks for a number of reasons)."

I'd outright remove Datasucker from the card pool or at least drastically modify it to make it more expensive, cost more influence, and not interact so easily with Parasite. I'd say it's easier to just ditch Datasucker and encourage the use of much weaker cards like Ice Carver, Scrubbed, etc to reduce ICE strength for Parasite.

Netrunner,3cf1lv,imthemostmodest,1 point,Wed Jul 8 19:18:57 2015 UTC,Yep. I believe Lukas has said he didn't expect Mimic and Yog.0 to get as much play as it has. Anarch is supposed to have good fracters and they ended up with some of the best decoders and killers. Datasucker is the big offender in my opinion and should be 3 or 4 influence. That lets others use Mimic and Yog.0 but shuts down the rampant use of Datasucker that works way better in other factions.

Taking Link is too much of a choice based on what the Corp is playing, which means that many games are going to see all that Link being a dead draw.  Cards that reward the Runner for having lots of Link (not just 2) would make high-Link decks a thing. An Icebreaker with Strength equal to Link, for instance."

Link is one of those things that feels really good when you have lots, if you hit a high trace like Midseasons (and can act as a disincentive to things like SEA Source). But there's not really much reason to have a ton of it. Underworld Contacts turn on at 2, but don't get any better after that.

Netrunner,3cf1lv,RS14-2,21,Tue Jul 7 19:33:17 2015 UTC,"Personally, I think the design of Netrunner is pretty solid. There are a few changes I would like to see regarding balance (looking at you, Astroscript), but I think the only design change I would make is to how mulliganing works.  I would use a Hearthstone style mulligan (set aside any number of cards, then draw that many; shuffle the set aside cards into your deck) instead of the current all-or-nothing mulligans."
Netrunner,3cf1lv,mustang255,5,Tue Jul 7 16:53:37 2015 UTC,"I never thought about this but that would actually be great!

Netrunner,3cf1lv,sigma83,14,Wed Jul 8 10:02:37 2015 UTC,"The bad pub mechanic is not granular enough. 1 BP is a huge amount (potentially $4/turn for frequent runners) which results in many BP-granting Corp cards seeing little to no play, and ironically many Runner cards like Frame Job seeing no play because they're priced too high in response.  The trace system is much better than ONR but still not very good. A lot of trace cards are much too weak because (a) Andy and Kate have 1 base link (b) Runners generally make more credits than Corp, so pumping traces in a 1-1 credit exchange is usually bad for Corp unless it's a game-winning situation like SEA Source.  Advanceable ambushes don't work outside of flatline decks. When the Runner can usually decide to win on centrals, a scoring deck cannot afford to spend slots on 0-trash, non-ICE, non-econ cards that require clicks and money to arm and then usually more money to activate IF the Runner goes there. Corps wouldn't need Caprice and Ash as much if Runners were at all scared to run an advanced card in a remote.   The faction system is great in reducing a monoculture of decks, but it breaks down when some cards are so much stronger than in faction alternatives that they can be splashed everywhere (Jackson, Eli) or are neutral (NAPD)."
Netrunner,3cf1lv,Kivou,2,Tue Jul 7 13:34:10 2015 UTC,"I like your point about advanceable traps. What if they just cost a few credits to trash? The corp will usually trash them after they've been hit anyway to use the server (if they didn't get the kill), so the only difference I can see it making is that they'd be sliiiightly better advancement banks for Trick of Light decks.  If Cerebral Overwriter cost 5 to trash, for example, it wouldn't get ditched out of R&D / HQ so easily, making it much more threatening and interesting."

Netrunner,3cf1lv,robots-dont-lie,1 point,Tue Jul 7 21:04:57 2015 UTC,The issue is trashing it from R&D / HQ rather than when it's installed. Presenting runners with a choice between spending X creds now to defuse to trap or possibly running into it later is I think more the point?
Netrunner,3cf1lv,SeaSourceScorch,2,Tue Jul 7 21:13:11 2015 UTC,"Yes I know. But still, an ambush makes for good upgrade protection. It would be bonkers if they were expensive to trash as well. Well, maybe add that an ambush can only fire once."

Netrunner,3cf1lv,codgodthegreat,7,Wed Jul 8 06:10:46 2015 UTC,"The problem with all the calls to make Link more useful to the Runner that I see in this thread is that tracing is already weak for the Corporation.  If you further weaken it by making link better for the Runner, then the Corp has further disincentive to play traces, meaning the counter-tracing aspect of it is even less valuable.  Corp needs a way to include tracing in their decks which aren't completely invalidated by link in order to give the Runner a reason to play it.  My own prediction is that until we see some Corp ICE that has ""Trace X: Do something hideously horrible to the Runner.  If the trace fails, do something inconvenient to the Runner"" or start seeing multiple-use Corp cards that feature a good trace ability as one effect or a weaker non-trace ability as a lesser effect, we're not going to see link being played long-term.  The problem isn't that there aren't good trace cards (Caduceus is a good example of one that's not in the murder suite that'll be played regardless), the problem is that once the Runner starts playing Link, then even those will disappear from Corp lists, because Corp doesn't have the deck space to have many cards that can be completely obviated by Link.  Maybe we need a new subtype of tracing card that says something like ""Discard this card face-up from HQ: Draw a card.  Use only when the Runner has link >= X""."
Netrunner,3cf1lv,Lluluien,10,Tue Jul 7 14:48:15 2015 UTC,"Corp deckspace is the #1 problem with the game, and it's inherent from the game mechanics.  You HAVE to burn ~20% of your deck on Agendas, and then as you start the game with huge vulnerabilities on two central servers you HAVE to burn another ~20% of your deck just to plug the gaping holes you start the game with.  Corp deck design is stunted as a result of this and it's the single biggest problem in Netrunner's design diversity.  If Corps could be more diverse then Runners would have to be more diverse and flexible and niche Runner cards (like Link) would get played, but as Runners know pretty much what the Corp is going to do they've no need to play it."
Netrunner,3cf1lv,satellite_uplink,2,Tue Jul 7 15:43:01 2015 UTC,"+1. I just play casually with a friend, and we have maybe half of the cards, but I have definitely felt this effect the entire time. However, I think it is a little bit overstated: 49 card decks can have 7 agendas, or 6 with Government Takeover, while 44 card decks can have 6 agendas. Here the percentages are significantly lower than 20%, at 14.3%, 12.2%, and 13.6% respectively. These decks have their drawbacks, of course, but it does free up a few slots.  In reading this sub I've noticed phases, such as shortly after O&C released, where these have been very popular. Presumably the strong constraints that higher agenda density brings about is a part of that popularity."
Netrunner,3cf1lv,zojbo,6,Tue Jul 7 16:25:44 2015 UTC,"It's possible to build a deck with lower numbers of agendas, but typically Corps play 9-11 agendas, which would be 18-22%.

I also agree that Link/Traces are a cool part of the game that is basically non-existent. I'm not sure how you'd fix it aside from just putting traces on everything though.   I would change Caprice to be more like Ash, so that at least you could trash her after she fires either way. Of course her trash cost would have to go up to compensate.   After that I'd probably just try to tweak things like making more consoles viable. Thematically I find it kind of annoying that each faction has basically one good one. Consoles could be like this cool extra ID you use when you build your deck to skew it down different paths. Right now you just use Astrolabe if you're Shaper, Desperado if you're Criminal, Grimoire/Vigil if you're Anarch with very few exceptions."
Netrunner,3cf1lv,ChaosHat,8,Tue Jul 7 12:49:07 2015 UTC,"Gonna disagree with Kit. I could see a push for 12 influence, but certainly not 15. With decoders being the best in-faction breaker of Shapers, everyone would play Kit if she had 15 influence. That ability is really powerful."

Netrunner,3cf1lv,X-factor103,7,Tue Jul 7 16:38:13 2015 UTC,"As much as I'd love to give my favourite runner such a boost, X-factor103 is correct. If Kit had 15 influence she would absolutely be the best Shaper and (outside of more specific builds like Nasir) you'd be mad to play anything else.   The release of Refractor made her very competitive. I took her to 4th in the UK Nationals (150-ish players). 12 influence would certainly help to boost non-stealth builds and make my stealth build even tastier. I'd be very happy with 12 influence. If her influence were 15 I'd probably ditch her as my runner of choice to maintain my netrunner-hipster credentials."

She has Inside Job on a stick plus the ability to use it with other run events; she would just run everywhere like the fastest Criminal deck, recurring siphons all over the place, then transition into Magnum Opus big rig if the corp ever managed to stabilize.  For making link more relevant, I'd like to see more repeatable traces like Manhunt. Something like a 0 rez, 5 trash asset with, ""At the start of your turn trace2. If successful, gain 1credit.

Even if you somehow managed to install three copies of each Caïssa, Blue Sun can bounce back anything.  You might get a slight economic advantage from the Corp having to pay to reinstall ICE in that position, but you'll quickly lose card advantage from constant trashing.    At absolute best, you'll end up with twelve turns with diminishing parts of your suite (that assumes that the overly-optimistic case where you can mass install four times (Amped Up and Same Old Thing), they have twelve unique pieces of ICE on the field, and you have the entire Caïssa suite in hand).  That's if everything went perfectly for you, though I can't say things are going particularly well if the Corp has twelve pieces of ICE installed and the Runner is just getting their breaker suite out.    Alternately, the Runner can just use Overmind and Corroder."
Netrunner,3cf1lv,poeir,17,Wed Jul 8 15:54:50 2015 UTC,"Right, in responding to u/rejusu and u/lluluien I think I have hit on an idea that I'd like to try.    I'd like to see the Corp start the game with Ice in front of both R&D and HQ.  The impact is that Corps don't feel ""I must play loads of Ice to see enough to play on turn 1"" and gain a bunch of deckslots to be more creative with, offsetting the restriction on deckbuilding of still having to pack Agendas.  They'd also not have to spend every first turn in some sort of combination of 'Ice R&D, Ice HQ, play economy' which is, let's face it, how a lot of Netrunner games start.  I think starting with a copy of Rainbow over R&D and HQ would be good to trial.  As an Ice choice it's at an interesting point: it's ETR but doesn't force the runner to find a specific breaker type to get in, it's potentially taxing so good on Centrals but any efficient breaker can nullify that tax, it's cheap enough to rez turn one but you can't rez both without doing something to gain cash.  So Corps gain a big boost from having it there, but in the long run by the midgame that boost will have been largely neutralised and you're still playing the same game we play now."
Netrunner,3cf1lv,satellite_uplink,1 point,Tue Jul 7 15:54:20 2015 UTC,"To be honest I don't think Corps would actually get more creative without also rebalancing the 'interesting' cards to be less underpowered (relative to simply having more money to score or threaten a kill with).  With your rule but the current card pool, I'd imagine Corps simply cut 3-4 ICE for more economy and play the same game as now except turn 1 is ICE, money, money instead of ICE, ICE, money."
Netrunner,3cf1lv,Kivou,1 point,Wed Jul 8 13:21:35 2015 UTC,"Maybe, but I feel when I'm making a deck it's not the economy cards that get squeezed because they're pretty non-negotiable, it's the 'other stuff' that makes way for the core of Ice/Agendas/Economy that you can't really mess with."

Netrunner,3cf1lv,Slothmano,25,Wed Jul 8 09:01:48 2015 UTC,"I'd fix the art on dedicated response team, as it's obviously upside down. When turned around the right way, it's a really nice visual joke where at first it looks like the armored guys are running along the ground but then you notice the angle of the skyline and realize they are running up the side of the building. It's really cool. However, the skewed skyline seems to have made FFG put the card art upside down, which is the visual equivalent of bungling the punchline for a joke. Rather than the clarity of a team that seems to be running on the ground, there's a moment of confusion why they seemed to be stuck to the ceiling first, and the angle of the light coming from below makes it hard to intuitively interpret the light and shadow and figure out what's going on. It's not a card I see often, but it's one of my favourite pieces of art right side up and it grates on my nerves every time I see it."

Netrunner,3cf1lv,TribalCypher,1 point,Tue Jul 7 14:54:11 2015 UTC,"I agree that the art would also work rotated 90 degrees, though I still interpret their pose as ""running"". The visible foot of the middle operative is not in contact with the glass like we would expect if they were preparing to go through the window, all of their faceplates are gazing towards the top instead of the glass, and their centers of gravity seem to indicate that they are traveling upwards and not into the glass itself.   Admittedly, my main reason for believing it was upside down is that the art on cards can be more easily flipped than rotated given the size ratio, but I suppose the card might have been cropped in such a way that would have allowed it to be rotated 90 degrees. Without access to the original art, I can't be sure."
Netrunner,3cf1lv,Sunergy,2,Tue Jul 7 15:43:46 2015 UTC,It's makes a lot more sense when you realize that the card art is facing the runner. So it looks like there about to breach towards them.

Netrunner,3cf1lv,Sunergy,11,Tue Jul 7 14:08:10 2015 UTC,"I think the ""redesign"" level fix for link (and not just ""here's a card that makes it better"") is to work traces in to the game regardless of what cards are in the corp deck. Something like a trace at the end of every run (successful or not) based on the number of ICE encounters (which means it would be boosted by encountering ice multiple times via cards like The Twins or Cell Portal), but if the runner's link is equal to or greater than the number of ICE encounters then it bypasses the trace entirely.  I think that this sort of design fix creates an interesting decision point for the runner where they can either:  a)maintain link to avoid the end-of-run traces  b)attempt to maintain economic superiority so they can still beat the end-of-run traces without having to deal with tags landing in the first place  c) let the end-of-run trace fire and just accept an additional tax of click+creds after every run to clear the tag  d)go full on tag-me from the start"

You just sort of build your deck and do your thing regardless of what the corp is doing, where the original purpose of link (and traces and tags etc etc) is to foster an interactive element of the game.  And my proposed solution wouldn't make link essential for all runners in every match up. Ice destruction runners would care less about it by keeping ice on servers low/gone. TagMe runners will armor up and let the tags build up (and maybe trip on some paper every once in a while). Tag prevention (NACH, decoy, forger, etc) or tag removal (crash space, lawyer up) tools can be used to remove/lower the tax for removing the tag after the run if you decide to just let the trace fire. FA/Rush corps don't ice very deep in the first place. Even RP (which is considered a ""glacier"" deck) frequently doesn't ice that deep, instead relying on click tax (ID, ELP) and caprice to keep the runner out for a turn while it pushes an agenda through.  All it would do is guarantee that traces happen on a regular basis, for which link can be utilized as one of many different strategies to fight against it."
Netrunner,3cf1lv,MagnumNopus,1 point,Tue Jul 7 19:07:10 2015 UTC,A general end-of-run-trace would be cool. Even if the runner jacks out. Maybe we get a card for that on nbn.
Netrunner,3cf1lv,Mechator_Rex,1 point,Wed Jul 8 10:13:54 2015 UTC,"Manhunt almost gets there, it's ""first successful run"" only though, so no go if the runner jacks out (and only once if the runner is just spamming keyhole runs or something), and still falls in to the bucket of ""traces are only relevant if the corp deck builds them to be relevant"".  There are certainly any number of ways to make traces more relevant via the introduction of new cards, but they all ultimately fall in to the trap of ""this only matters if the corp includes this card""."
Netrunner,3cf1lv,MagnumNopus,1 point,Wed Jul 8 12:58:31 2015 UTC,"Yes, but for example that new idea… snitch and that one that gives you credits when you jack out… that combo… a general trace would punish such things. It gets destroyed the moment an agenda is stolen. Is an agenda stolen before the run ends, when one is acessed? AFAIK yes. No effect there either. So yes, manhunt gets you there closer, in a sense of throwing a rock into the sky, hoping to hit the ISS."

Netrunner,3cf1lv,Dominion_Prime,3,Tue Jul 7 14:53:16 2015 UTC,What? I agree he is incredibly vital but the already strongest Corp gets him free of influence while everyone else pays. I say nbn pays influence to him too... Ya dig?
Netrunner,3cf1lv,alexbaha,3,Tue Jul 7 14:43:43 2015 UTC,"NBN wasn't always the best faction. Only when NEH was a thing did this really happen, and that was a whole cycle after Jackson was a thing.  NBN needed a buff for a long time and Jackson was a nice one, but it didn't turn NBN into an instant tournament winning faction.  Look at the acoo.net tournament list. About page 12 when Upstalk was released, and then it's all NEH. Before that there was the odd Making News deck, but nothing like the amount of NEH."
Netrunner,3cf1lv,LeverArchFile,2,Tue Jul 7 15:48:36 2015 UTC,"Was it because of Jackson, or because of not needing to spend influence on Jackson? I'm willing to argue the former :)"

In 2014, it's 43% pre-cut, 50% post-cut. And NBN didn't win either year.  Stimhack results have a strong showing for NBN between JH and NEH, but it gets much more pronounced after that.

Netrunner,3cf1lv,RUBY_FELL,5,Wed Jul 8 02:51:40 2015 UTC,"The problem with link is that it does almost nothing in most games, because you're not getting traced very often if at all.  A runner is generally better off just having a good economy to be able to beat the occasional trace, and have a bunch of money for when they're not getting traced at all during a game (which is most games).  Even when you do get traced a lot, you still need to have actual money to beat the corp.  Because if you're gonna get traced a lot, chances are the corp is packing some recurring credits for it, and that's just cancelling out your link anyway.  I think the game design theory from the beginning has been that link will matter more over time as more tracing cards get introduced to the game.  But even when Punitive Counterstrike was at its peak of popularity a few months ago, people still weren't packing link in their decks because it was still better to pack any econ card than it was to pack a link card.  For link to become relevant, we need to start seeing more uses for it.  Things like Underworld Contacts and the breakers that have no memory cost if you have enough link.  But we need more than that.  I'm hoping that once what's-her-name, the 2-link ID, comes out in the next big box, she'll come with some things that utilize link for new purposes.  Maybe like an event that gives x credits, or a tutor for a card that costs x or less, where x is your link."
Netrunner,3cf1lv,Horse625,2,Tue Jul 7 13:46:11 2015 UTC,"If link becomes a think, you think people will start including Net Police? I can barely stifle a chuckle.  Cmon, how many of you remember what this card did before you looked it up?"

Netrunner,3cf1lv,Razalhague,8,Tue Jul 7 17:45:13 2015 UTC,"I would completely redesign the stealth mechanic so that it operates as bypassing instead of breaking ice. For several reasons:   1. Bypassing ice using stealth feels more flavorful and thematic rather than just ""breaking the ice with a different source of credits""   2. continuing #1, it feels weird to me that installing a bunch of extra hardware and resources (making my rig clunkier) actually improves my stealthiness. seems counterintuitive - ""I'm a much quieter runner when I have these extra 6 hardwares running at full power!""   3. Continuing #2 - recurring hardware credits could then be used for ""noisy"" breakers - a new subtype - the recurring credits allow noisy breakers to be very efficient but at a downside of tracing yourself, tagging yourself, etc.   4. 'normal' breakers already use credits to break ice. Having breakers that 'bypass' ice (or individual subroutines?) would be a new/unique style of running that could open up design space.    Femme seems like the original stealth breaker - break sentries normally, or ""stealth"" past a particular ice."
Netrunner,3cf1lv,PubWisdom,2,Tue Jul 7 15:36:18 2015 UTC,"This is definitely nice and flavourful, and would actually be very good.  Stealth shouldn't really care about something's STRENGTH should it?  So yeah I definitely agree that it would be nice to see this, although I'm not quite sure how that mechanic might work."
Netrunner,3cf1lv,satellite_uplink,2,Tue Jul 7 17:51:07 2015 UTC,Not caring about strength is reflected in the massive boosts to icebreaker strength stealth programs get when stealth credits are spent. It just keeps the mechanics of the game simple to require that icebreakers have to match strength.
Netrunner,3cf1lv,Wakks,1 point,Wed Jul 8 00:37:45 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's just it though.  In 'keeping it simple' they 'made it the same'.

I think Netrunner does suffer from only having one currency, which strips away layers of complexity and nuance."

Netrunner,3cf1lv,SmilingGak,2,Wed Jul 8 13:06:41 2015 UTC,"That's resources not currencies.  And you forgot Cards, and MU... etc.  There's only one currency though."
Netrunner,3cf1lv,satellite_uplink,6,Wed Jul 8 13:28:38 2015 UTC,I would want some influence added to core set anarch cards and maybe a few extra creds for desperado and maybe toolbox at 6. link and psi can be fixed by adding more cards that make them relevant or less of an issue.
Netrunner,3cf1lv,Jaggerbyte,16,Tue Jul 7 12:29:37 2015 UTC,"I like these suggestions. Maybe add 1 to Caprice's rez cost.  Have the core set contain 3x of every card. Remove a few chaff cards so that ""starter"" decks aren't too big.  OP, at this point I'd wait until Data and Destiny to decide the viability of link. Admittedly, it was pretty weak in the Core set.  Edit: Astro Script and Nisei Mk 2 also require the corp to spend a credit to use their agenda counter ability."
Netrunner,3cf1lv,JimTor,6,Tue Jul 7 12:50:59 2015 UTC,"Having the core set have 3x of every card would dramatically impoverish the overall card variety for people just getting into the game. We're actually having this conversation over in the AGOT community. The trend is actually in the other direction; Conquest and AGOT 2E actually have mostly 1x cards. It makes a third core set more of a necessity, but it makes for the broadest possible starting card pool and avoids the steep drop-off in value added for the third core set that we have with Netrunner."
Netrunner,3cf1lv,grimwalker,8,Tue Jul 7 14:04:01 2015 UTC,"I believe Doomtown Reloaded handles this the best. They have premade core decks in the box, similar to how Netrunner allows you to shuffle all the cards of a particular faction together with the neutral cards and have a legal, semi-viable deck (at least for learning purposes). But they then also have another sealed pack of cards containing all the “extra” cards to bring you up to 3x of everything. It’s labeled to say you shouldn’t open that pack until you’re ready to start deck building. Imagine if Netrunner did this. Shuffle all the blue cards with the neutrals to make a deck. But when you’re ready to build, pop open that extra pack to find two more of each console, the rest of the SanSan city grids, etc. I love FFG but their “core sets” for their LCGs always seem like such a cynical cash grab."
Netrunner,3cf1lv,jkopplin,2,Tue Jul 7 16:09:27 2015 UTC,"hell, i'd add 2 to caprice. I can under stand there not being 3x in the starter they need the money. Astro and Nisei are fine as of this cycle. But I really get what your saying. I think the Mumbad cycle is going to shake things up more than san san has."
Netrunner,3cf1lv,Jaggerbyte,2,Tue Jul 7 14:19:20 2015 UTC,"They're fine now, but tweaking the core set with a time machine would've allowed the designers to do more with the first three cycles. It felt like they were hampered by the strength of some of the starter cards. I love that there hasn't been power creep, but I think with the changes mentioned, the cards would still be good and see top tier play."
Netrunner,3cf1lv,JimTor,3,Tue Jul 7 14:32:35 2015 UTC,"Hopefully Sunny will be bringing the link mechanics to the runner game. Maybe an AI breaker with strength equal to the runners' link, or events that initiate traces on the runner side. If her link cards aren't too influence-intensive or have trash abilities, Geist might import them.  As for the psi game, I like it. It's a way to give the corp options that aren't tied to winning the money war. It's also a mechanic that's exclusive to Jinteki so far, so it's fitting into a specific set of decks."
Netrunner,3cf1lv,rumirumirumirumi,3,Tue Jul 7 13:43:42 2015 UTC,Extra net/meat damage results in brain damage instead of loss. Would give more design space around damage dealing cards without them being game breaking.

Netrunner,3cf1lv,Bsq,1 point,Tue Jul 7 14:08:49 2015 UTC,I think that's a great solution to what I think is a big problem with the game (Psi mechanic).  Those costs would ensure that 0 is the most common bid and that runners would have a better than 1/3 chance to win.
Netrunner,3cf1lv,voodoochile78,6,Tue Jul 7 20:26:57 2015 UTC,One thing that's always annoyed me is Tracex  The amount that the trace is for is really important- why make it a tiny number? Just because it looks a bit cooler? It just guarantees the runner has to check your trace cards because they don't stand a chance of reading the trace strength without picking it up...
Netrunner,3cf1lv,porphyro,5,Tue Jul 7 15:40:34 2015 UTC,"I definitely think it should have been Trace(x). Looks more code-y, to boot!"
Netrunner,3cf1lv,Azeltir,3,Tue Jul 7 17:25:44 2015 UTC,"1) Either eliminate the Psi game or just be judicious about when to use it.  If they want to use it on cards like Snowflake or whatnot, that's fine, but Caprice and Marcus Batty are just bullshit.  2) Astroscript needs to be a 3/1  3) Desperado needs to not be as good.  Maybe by costing 4 credits?  Account Siphon needs to be not quite as good too.  And Andromeda didn't need the link.  4) Influence of the best Anarch cards has to go way up.  5) Jackson Howard needs to be a neutral 1-influence card  6) NEH was just a middle finger to any sense of fairness.  17 influence in a faction that doesn't spend 3 for Jackson AND card draw?  Get the fuck out of here.  15 influence, at most, plus a neutral 1-influence Jackson Howard.  7) Currents.  I absolutely hate them and want them out of the game forever.  So many of them have absolutely brutal effects that the other player really can't do much about.    8) Kit at 12 influence  9) A better mulligan mechanic.  This is especially necessary for corps.  Maybe you are allowed to keep 1 or 2 cards and mulligan the rest.  And finally, I do not like FFGs card games that have too many card subtypes.  Think of Game of Thrones.  They had to redesign it because card subtypes got so out of control.  In Netrunner, it's subtypes like ""Grail"" or ""Caissa"" or that kind of thing.  I think FFG needs to be really careful about creating too many weird subtypes, or else they are going to make the same mistake as they did with Game of Thrones."
Netrunner,3cf1lv,voodoochile78,1 point,Tue Jul 7 20:19:34 2015 UTC,+1 to Grails and Caissas. I'd so much rather see cards that combo all around than inside their subtype.  What if corp and runner were allowed to choose their starting hand?
Netrunner,3cf1lv,voodoochile78,1 point,Tue Jul 7 20:52:41 2015 UTC,Maybe choose one card that gets to be in their starting hand.
Netrunner,3cf1lv,RUBY_FELL,1 point,Tue Jul 7 21:20:28 2015 UTC,"1) Maybe you're right. I feel like the counters to Caprice might make her slightly less (or greater than?) than bullshit.   2) Yes. Or a 4/2?  3) Desperado should cost more, yes. Account Siphon has proven to be less then OP... the counters make it good/great, not god-level. Andy should have 0 link.  4) Word.  5) Word.  6) Word.  7) I don't think any of them are brutal outside of ELP in RP. That's a mean combo for sure. And along with Caprice (which has been discussed) explains why, despite the bullshittiness of NEH, RP is still top dog.   8) Word.  9) Maybe, yeah.  The ""problems"" with Game of Thrones allows FFG to resell the whole game. Brilliant if you ask me. But, also bad for the consumer. So, yeah."

It would require a bunch of other things being rebalanced (like the cost of removing tags), but ultimately the Runner can choose to attack the Corp and the Corp can't choose to attack the Runner.  click: Trace 0, if successful give the Runner a tag.  With both players able to force interaction the game gets more interesting, you get a whole new strand of Corp strategies around aggressively tagging and disrupting the runner instead of having to sit back in the crash position.    Right now Corps are SO limited by what they can do and the amount of space in their deck to do it.  I think in summary anything I looked at doing would be first around breaking that rigidity in the Corp deck structure that sees you lose 70% of your deckspace before really having to make huge design decisions.  Runners have so much more freedom to attack the corp in different ways and because it's a one-way street the Corp just has to sit there and take it."

Netrunner,3cf1lv,apreche,2,Tue Jul 7 16:07:48 2015 UTC,"I would make ICE destruction, like Parasite, a lot more difficult for the runner.  The fundamental concept of Netrunner is that the corp pays for ICE one time and the runner has to pay for that ICE repeatedly. So even though a Caduceus costs 3 to rez, the runner has to pay 2 over and over again. And thus, corp credits are worth so much more than runner credits.  If the runner just parasites and utensils every ICE, that fundamental conceit is turned upside down. It's the reason runners are dominating right now. Good runners almost never get hit by a subroutine that isn't ETR, and they hardly ever repeatedly pay a large amount to deal with ICE. They always find some way to get by it for almost nothing. Also, Yog is effectively the same as ICE destruction.  I wouldn't completely remove ICE destruction from the game, I would just make it a lot more difficult. Cards like Kraken are fine. Utensils are fine if Eater is a bit less efficient. Yog needs to at least charge the runner 1 credit for TWO subroutines, or maybe make it Str 2 instead of 3. Parasite should decrease ICE str by 1 for every TWO virus counters. Give me some time to find new ICE!  Also, I shouldn't be one to talk about this, because I play full on super Parasite recursion and blow all 'dem ICE up!! I know how strong it is because I use it.  Oh is that R&D unprotected? Why, thank you!"

Netrunner,3cf1lv,zojbo,2,Tue Jul 7 17:51:53 2015 UTC,"I don't think I would actually want the game to change this way, but there is definitely something that wound up being very different from how I expected when I heard about the premise.   Specifically, I envisioned a game with a lot more pieces, each one probably simpler than the ones in ""real"" Netrunner, moving at the same time, especially on Corp side. I envisioned a game where the Corp has a ton of resources but has to get a ton of things done to win, while the runner is nowhere near equipped to stop the Corp from doing everything they want to do. This game would have the Corp's vulnerable ""assets"" (which would include the analogue of agendas that actually win them the game) out on the field for a long time, but on the flip side centrals would either not exist or need specialized tools to get into.  The closest I've seen to this in ""real"" Netrunner has been asset economy HB. Here the corp is getting a ton of money, but until late it doesn't have enough to defend all of it, while the runner also doesn't have enough to tear down all of it, even with some of it left undefended. But then the Corp doesn't have to put the game-winning components out on the board for more than one turn (and with enough money, they can often Biotic Labor to avoid even that), so it's not really the same. On the other hand, Jinteki shell game often has agendas on the board for large periods of time, but that has death traps, which wouldn't be a major component of this imaginary game, if they were there at all.  Sorry if this is a bit off-topic."

Some ideas:   Total agenda points for Corp side goes up. Number of advancements for agendas goes up. Corp econ goes up to balance the above. The Corp gets some initial defenses (hardcoded by the rules, drawn from some sort of sideboard, built into the ID card, or something like this). The result would be something like a Wall of Static on HQ, R&D, and one remote, all rezzed immediately. Successful central runs would carry some automatic penalty (maybe a tag). The point here is that the Runner should not be able to easily win by multi-access solitaire. Flatline would be removed (easy enough to do by just not including the cards) and if need be the Clot effect would be permanent. The point here is that the Corp should not be able to win by covering centrals and waiting for combos, they have to put cards out to win.  To make that central run penalty significant, the Runner will have to be dependent on something that the Corp can threaten using that penalty. For example the Runner might get constrained to resource economy if it were a tag (so Magnum Opus, Au Revoir, etc. would get banned).   That list right now sounds like it would swing the game dramatically in favor of Runner side (using the established card pool with bans and no additional cards). I'm not sure how to fix that in this framework. Perhaps the runner would have to use some sort of ""exposure"" functionality (analogous to advancement) in order to actually ""score"" an agenda, giving the Corp would get time to do things for ""good publicity"" that would get the agenda removed from the game."
Netrunner,3cf1lv,Rejusu,5,Wed Jul 8 18:28:46 2015 UTC,"I don't think any of the games issues really trace back to the games core mechanics, those are solid. Most of the minor flaws tend to be with the card pool. Link is only relatively unimportant because there aren't many good cards that grant it and most corp decks that use trace focus on landing a few big ones (e.g. midseasons, SEA, punitive) rather than lots of smaller ones (which is where link is most useful). As for psi games I disagree that it's disconnected from the rest of the game state. It's tied to your credit pool. Hit a corp with a vamp or a siphon or just bid zero every time and you can break through."
Netrunner,3cf1lv,satellite_uplink,2,Tue Jul 7 13:10:59 2015 UTC,"I think this is broadly true.  Most of what I see talked about here is card balancing issues, not rules issues.  The one thing I'd want to do (as I've posted seperately in the thread) is try and give Corps a way to force interaction.  I feel the biggest problem is how inflexible Corp deckbuilding is as much of your deck structure is prescribed (""I need X agendas from a relatively small pool of options, X to Y ice from a relatively small pool of options, X to Y economy cards from a relatively small pool of options... right what do I do with the last 7 slots in my deck?"").  That's partly because they're so defensive and can't go onto the front foot, while on the flipside the runner has much more freedom in deckbuilding because they don't have these gaping critical weaknesses to plug before they can even get started."
Netrunner,3cf1lv,destrinstorm,3,Tue Jul 7 15:40:12 2015 UTC,I assume you mean Netrunner 3.0 since we're already on version 2?
Netrunner,3cf1lv,TonyStellato,2,Tue Jul 7 16:00:21 2015 UTC,"Very minor stuff, tbh. I don't think Psi is a huge problem (no one was complaining about it a few months back. It only became a ""problem"" when Clot was released). I don't think Fast Advance is a problem. I'm pretty happy where the game is at. If I were redesigning it, I guess one thing I would change is the art for Kate in the Core Set :P"
Netrunner,3cf1lv,m50d,2,Tue Jul 7 18:07:07 2015 UTC,People have been complaining about Caprice (rightly IMO) since before she was released. It was just briefly overshadowed by complaints about NEH.
Netrunner,3cf1lv,grimwalker,3,Tue Jul 7 22:27:14 2015 UTC,"Let's see:   I'd clarify what ""zero"" means. Maybe this is just a templating issue, but I would avoid templating cards like Yog, RSVP, Komainu, and Woodcutter that cause weird interactions and FAQ entries around whether ""zero"" is or is not a thing. True dichotomies. A run which is Successful is Successful. A run which is not successful, is necessarily unsuccessful. Likewise agendas: I was convinced of this in a thread a few days ago by /u/bluesapphyre. The FAQ needs to amend the rulebook to say:    Rezzed and Unrezzed Cards  The Corporation’s installed non-agenda cards have two play states: rezzed, which means that the card is faceup and active, and unrezzed, which means that the card is facedown and inactive. Face down agendas are considered unrezzed, but face up agendas are not considered rezzed.   To decouple that dichotomy, I would probably change the terminology to ""Dark"" versus ""Active."" Something along those lines, so that ""neither"" is a logical option.    To avoid the need for a Jackson Howard, I'd try to bake in some means to deal with agenda flood. Maybe the corp could have the option to discard cards if they're over hand size, or just shuffle all of HQ into R&D and accept the tempo hit of not having many cards to play. Maybe limit this to once per game, and turn your ID face down if you elect to use it. There would be many ways to tinker with this, but Agenda Flood is a weakness of the core game mechanic that I would try and address...somehow."
Netrunner,3cf1lv,Pravinoz,2,Tue Jul 7 15:51:57 2015 UTC,"Add cards or rules for different formats, like a ""Two headed giant"" mode. I love the one on one aspect of the game, but it's hard to bring out netrunner as the ""board game"" that it's billed as with multiple friends, especially those not interested in deckbuilding. If there were a game mode where I could give less initiated friends premade decks to ""support"" hardcore netrunners, like in archenemy or emperor, that would be awesome. Imagine being a runner trying to score agendas against three corps working ""together"", or being a corp with a sysop trying to break into a rival doing the same to you, or being the big bad megacorp flipping over crazy schemes to down three runners."
Netrunner,3cf1lv,BoomFrog,2,Tue Jul 7 15:56:44 2015 UTC,"Give a default action to the Corp:   Click: put a card from archives into R&D.  If you are screwed on economy or ICE you can try to fix it with basic actions which is great.  If you are screwed by agenda flood there is no basic action to help.  Doing it this way would at least require the risk of the agenda sitting in archives for a turn or an extra click to instal over an agenda then hide it in R&D.  This might not be strong enough, I might just make it free at start of turn like the mandatory draw."
Netrunner,3cf1lv,RS14-2,2,Tue Jul 7 19:14:22 2015 UTC,"I think something needs to be done about 3/2 agendas. I don't like that we're stuck with the same 3/2 agendas until rotation. If you want to do fast advance, there is almost no choice to be made in your agenda selection.   I don't know how to solve this. One crude way would be to mark certain agendas as type A and type B, and say ""each deck can include at most 3 type A and 6 type B agendas"", and make all the 2/1s type A and all the 3/2s type B. Or we could mark all 3/2 and 2/1 agendas with a '+' and limit players to 9 '+' agendas per deck.   Any ideas?"
Netrunner,3cf1lv,Wakks,1 point,Tue Jul 7 19:46:09 2015 UTC,"That's kind of the point of fast advance. It's a necessary archetype to counter the slower but inevitable big rig, but suffers from a lack of agenda diversity/usefulness. Weyland fast advance is doable out of only one identity and is spending gobs of influence to run. Jinteki has 4 3/2 agendas and only one that actually does something when scored, and isn't related to continued fast advancing. Medical Breakthrough is also playable, but you're begging the runner to steal the first one. HB has 2 playable 3/2 agendas, one of which does nothing, and another which could either seal the game or throw it in the bin. There is no functioning 2/1 agenda for them, the fake one takes 2 turns to score. NBN has the best agendas, so of course they're best at fast advance, but the issue was money for a long time. If an Astroscript isn't scored, the game remains very difficult for NBN since their ice tends to be porous.  Any choice to add more easily scored agendas would have to account for the fact that good 3/2 agendas are bad for the game if they come with good riders."

Netrunner,3cf1lv,vampire0,1 point,Tue Jul 7 16:36:34 2015 UTC,"Lots of good ideas here - if start with a solid logical rule book that doesn't allow for misunderstandings on triggers, sequencing and things as fundamental as what flatlines a runner.  For Traces I think lots more ice should have low impact cheap traces - something like trace 1 -> the runner looses a credit, or trace 0 -> the runner looses [click]. That would mean that there are more subs on each ice, forcing the runner to make a choice: invest in more link to ignore those routines (or force the Corp to spend to land them) or invest in more money to break them reliably. The problem is that they hav focused mostly on ice that only traces or not and tracer ice that has high-traces for strong effects. Imagine if Enigma's click-loss routine were instead a trace 1."
Netrunner,3cf1lv,Kopiok,2,Tue Jul 7 17:11:05 2015 UTC,"I would love for more ICE to have more subroutines that were not too terrible for the Runner not to break.

This is something that they can just do by printing new cards, though."
Netrunner,3cf1lv,SevenCs,1 point,Tue Jul 7 18:18:04 2015 UTC,"The absolute worst thing one could do, if one's goal was to make traces/link a more active part of the game, would be to introduce a bunch of trace0 or trace1 subs, let alone weaken existing ice by making them weak traces. If Enigma's click loss sub was a trace1, half the popular Runners could ignore it, without even adding +Link cards to their decks.  If you want Link and traces to be more relevant, traces must start at 3, 2 at the minimum. If Caduceus was trace1 on both its subs it would be absolute garbage."
Netrunner,3cf1lv,vampire0,1 point,Thu Jul 9 15:45:14 2015 UTC,"I think you're misreading me, even though your point is valid - if Enigma was straight up converted to have a trace for the Click loss it would be bad, but if it cost say, 2 credits and had a Trace2 on the click loss, that might no be so bad. Or if there was something like Enigma that cost 1 more, did what Enigma does and also had a Trace 1 on it - might be OK (not suggesting they should just print variations, just trying to establish a power level) - if Tsrugi is good cause it has 4 routines for 6, then 3 routines for 4 seems decent, even if one is a Trace.  The point about Trace 1 being bad has been made - that is why I've added a note about maybe having Ice that lowers the Runner's Link by 1 when encountering that ice - it seems counter intuitive to do that to get people to run link, but it means any one with 2 link is still OK, while those with 0 or 1 are going to have to pay if they don't want to break."
Netrunner,3cf1lv,ForgedIron,1 point,Thu Jul 9 16:56:40 2015 UTC,"I don't think i would tweak the rules much at all. Instead I would add more cards that traced. Link would be more useful if there was more tracing. The corp would have to choose between basic cards or more powerful trace based ones. or replace the word powerful with flexible.   Imagine an ambush card that trashes an installed runner card of corps choice on successful trace, but runners choice on unsuccessful one.  I would give the runners cards that interacted with the psi game. A virus that could gain additional counters whenever the runner lost a psi game. A resource that gathers all your credits spent on psi games. you can get it all back for 2c + trash. A shaper program that can be used for a do-over of the psi game. A criminal event which starts a run where the runner chooses and the corp is trying to guess. I think that the mechanic is fine, but needs MORE interactivity."

I'm extremely happy for the existence of Caprice Nisei, Astroscript Pilot Program or Scorched Earth and my only issue with Desperado is that it effectively lowers the trash cost of assets by one, which had a far-reaching effect of huge significance to the card pool."

Netrunner,3cf1lv,umchoyka,1 point,Tue Jul 7 18:02:25 2015 UTC,"Not sure if it would make the game too fiddly, but I'd experiment with making Trace and Link new collectible resources for the Corp and Runner, respectively. Instead of using credits for initiated traces, you'd spend your accumulated Trace and Link instead.  To collect these resources, ""econ"" cards would typically provide drip amounts. For example, Access to Globalsec would be changed to ""When your turn begins, Gain 1 Link"". The reason for the majority of cards being drip would be so that the game doesn't slow down due to having to dedicate clicks to earning multiple econ resources (aside from installs). Recurring trace credits (such as on Making News) could be recurring Trace instead. Cards that initiate traces could still be given values that give the Corp instant free Trace, but the values would have to be rebalanced (i.e. I would probably lower Midseason Replacements from 5).  Anyway, it would essentially force the Runner to have to have link lest even small traces would be devastating. Similarly, it opens the door for trace heavy decks since the (currently) superior Runner economy couldn't be leveraged along with the way link works now.  And you could include cards that convert Trace or Link into Credits. For instance, Underworld Contacts would instead become something like ""When your turn begins, you may spend 2 Link to gain 1 Credit""."
Netrunner,3cf1lv,Stonar,1 point,Tue Jul 7 19:31:49 2015 UTC,"Tags!  Scorched earth makes the design space for tags so limited.  No card will make tagging significantly easier than SEA Source/Midseasons, since Scorched Earth exists, and as long as Scorched exists, a tag + 2 scorched wins you the game (mostly.)  I would love to see more cards like Psychographics and Closed Accounts - I'd love to see tag punishment be more granular - make them a control mechanic to deprive the runner of resources, rather than a kill mechanic.  I think kill mechanics are good, but NBN (the tagging faction) has so little bite in what should be their defining mechanic.  I would love to see more design space in tags, more stuff to do with tags, and less binary - less ""tag and bag"" and more of a decision ""Well, if I keep this fourth tag, he can score an NAPD out of hand,"" or ""If I don't start clearing tags now, he'll play that card that trashes a program with cost less than the number of tags you have,"" or whatever.

Faerie rush really excelled when there was nothing better to do with your influence, most Shaper and Anarch decks were importing Desperado or Account Siphon just because. Additionally, Faerie far and away was the most efficient tool for breaking punishing sentries, and while that may sill be true in a sense, other powerful killers make those sentries less attractive to corps to begin with, who were often importing Archers and the like to ruin somebody's day, and many decks were often primarily sentries.

Netrunner,3cgpsd,thefalseidol,4,Wed Jul 8 00:21:41 2015 UTC,"I think it's obsolete, for a few reasons.  A big thing is not having influence for Lucky Find. The economic advantage that Lucky Find gets you with PPVP basically makes PPVP Kate a better rush ID than CT due to the economic potential alone.  Newer ICE, like Architect, will just burn Faeries unless you put in a Mimic. Then you might as well go Mimic + Sucker with Deus Ex/Sharpshooter support, for not a whole lot of extra card slots.  The strong deck archetype has been RP, which requires multiple runs which also burns a lot of Faeries.  Stealth also got the final piece it needed in Ghost Runner, so now stealth tends to have the best economic advantage and flexibility against sentries thanks to Switchblade.  I just thought of these off the top of my head. I just tried to build a basic Faerie Rush CT and was thinking the whole time ""Why Faeries instead of Mimic + Sucker and throw in Lucky Finds and with those why not PPVP and then why not Kate""... yadda yadda."

Did I say or imply that Caprice wasn't one of the very best Corp cards in the game? I feel like I talk about her in nearly every video.  Are you talking about the part where I mentioned the ""Caprice Nisei hate team?""  I meant that as an off-handed joke but maybe implied more than I intended.  You're right that Batty can do more devastating things than ending the run and also that ending the run is very powerful. My argument was that he's most commonly going to be used to end the run, not that ending the run is the absolute best thing you can do with him.  With the popularity of RP, I see Marcus getting the most play in there.  Perhaps I didn't make that clear in the video."

I don't want to go back and re-watch all your videos to find where you talk about the Psi mechanic (Caprice being the notable example), but I just have this general sense that you kinda like that mechanism being in the game.  A more recent, and therefore easily-findable example was from a recent thread here on Reddit where you were replying to Apreche:    I like Batty. Good Runners nowadays never ever let a meaningful subroutine fire. Give the corp a chance.  Also, just win the Psi game. -Apreche  I agree with /u/apreche. I've found that Runner is much stronger than Corp nowadays (and for the most of the history of the game), and ICE are largely just a number of credits taxed i.e. it doesn't really matter what ICE do, just how much they cost to break. That said, I'd also agree that Batty is kind of a lame way to do this type of effect and that it's largely going to make some of the best decks on both sides (RP and Shaper) better. -Willingdone    So admittedly you say that Marcus Batty is a lame way to accomplish a certain goal, but you did say ""I agree"" to a guy who's advice to not having your entire rig trashed or being flatlined was ""just win the Psi game""."
Netrunner,3cg4cs,apreche,2,Wed Jul 8 06:15:24 2015 UTC,"Thanks for watching my stuff and taking the time to explain where you're coming from! I don't think you're trashing me. We simply disagree.  Perhaps this will make my position clearer. Sorry for wall of text. It's complicated.  First, guilty as charged with the Psi game: I like the mechanic. That isn't to say that I like the particular implementations of it e.g. Caprice. We need to separate these ideas. I think that the Psi game is routinely getting blamed for much more deep-seated issues of the ICE-Icebreaker interaction. The problem isn't the mechanic, but rather that the few powerful defensive tools in the game use it. I take issue with the idea that Corps have to resort to stuff like Caprice to be able defend at all.  Replicating Perfection is one of the few truly Glacier style decks in the game and one of the even fewer decks in Netrunner that can reasonably include and score a 5-for-3. This is at the heart of the problem.  Underlying the necessity for the Psi game effects is that it's too easy to deal with ICE. This is partially because it's too easy to destroy ICE with Parasite, and partially because Icebreakers are too efficient. Most people can agree that Runner economy is better than Corp economy. That's been the case for the game's history. The root cause of this is that ICE don't defend well enough because the Runner effects to overcome them are too accessible.  It's too easy for every Runner deck to play a premium rig because the best rigs in the game cost <10 influence. The baseline rig is Corroder, Yog.0, Mimic, and Datasucker. It only gets better from there e.g. add in DAVID and Parasite; or Femme, Atman, and Sharpshooter; or play more a versatile Decoder. If Runners play such powerful rigs, they should have to spend most of their influence on them. As it is, every Runner deck can play a premium rig and also afford to import the powerful effects from the other factions e.g. multiaccess, ICE destruction, draw and tutor effects, and credit generators. This is especially true of Anarch since the baseline rig is in-faction.  Corp isn't like that. Corp's can't afford to import all of the best defensive tools in the game for two reasons: we can't import agendas and the best non-ICE defensive tools like Caprice cost a ton of influence. Only ICE are affordable with influence, and they're the weakest overall defensive options since every Runner plays the best solutions. A major consequence of this is that it's too difficult to score agendas through a scoring remote. Since Corp can't defend properly with ICE, they are forced to resort to other methods to score. We've only come up with two major solutions: chain Astroscripts + Fast Advance or stack every playable defensive tool you can.    Caprice is one of the main ways that the designers have tackled the remote server scoring problem.  Don't get me wrong: I don't like her as a card and wish that Corps didn't have to resort to stuff like that. I wish we could use very high quality ICE to stop the Runner, but even the very best ICE setups in the game don't stop them reliably enough.  So Corps have to use non-ICE options to stop the Runner because those are the only effects to which the Runner doesn't have a cheap solution.  Why is Future Perfect so good? Because it's the only 5-for-3 that you can reasonably include in your deck without getting devastated by RDI + Maker's, Indexing, and Medium. If Runner couldn't plow through Corp's ICE so readily, we might be more willing to play 5-for-3's with some game effect. As it is, our main criteria for including agendas in a Glacier style deck is ""how easily can the Runner steal this?"" Jinteki is best at Glacier in large part because it has access to twice as many difficult-to-steal agendas.    Here's the core of why I don't agree with most Caprice + Batty hate: everyone focuses on the Psi game and not the reasons why those effects are so strong. The problem isn't that the Psi game is random or that the game's outcome devolves into a subgame though those things can often be true: it's that the Corp can't properly defend and score without those effects. I too wish that the Psi game had been reserved to less powerful tools, but undeniably those types of defensive options need to exist in the game unless we want to play against exclusively Astrotrain. As much as we can take issue that Caprice and now Batty are the form they've taken, they're all we've got, and if we want Corp to stand a fighting chance, we're going to have to accept them or deal with the problems of the Runner card pool that precipitate their use.  TL;DR: Corp can't defend with ICE because every Runner has access to the best Icebreakers, so frustrating stuff like Caprice was printed to make it possible to score agendas out of remotes. The Psi game gets blamed for this much deeper issue."
Netrunner,3cg4cs,Vysetron,3,Wed Jul 8 18:03:53 2015 UTC,"I can empathize with both the corp and runner when it comes to playing ""traditional netrunner"" (i.e. setting up remotes and scoring behind them).  From the corp perspective, it sucks having a bunch of agendas in hand and no way to score them because the runner has a loaded Kati Jones and all breakers out.    From the runner perspective, I disagree that the runner economy is that much better than the corp economy (talking about today's meta game).  All I know is that when I'm playing against HB, Blue Sun, or RP in particular, they can very quickly set up servers where it costs more than 10 credits to bust into.  Once the game reaches that state, then I can't make runs on that server more than every 3rd-5th turn (depending on my econ).    So to me, the solution is that corps need to adopt a play style where you have things you use to bait runs, keeping in mind that runners can probably only run remotes every 3-5 turns.  That's a lot of scoring windows.  Personally, I already think there are plenty of cards that corps can use to do this, but since Caprice exists, it's just easier and more effective to include her.  What I think is an unacceptable solution, because it takes the fun out of the game, is having the runner save up money for 3-5 turns so he or she can run a server, only to face a 2 in 3 chance of getting kicked out entirely.    I guess if we had to summarize our disagreement is that you think it's too easy to get into servers (mainly because of data sucker and ice destruction), and I think it is very easy for corps to set up servers that cost 10 or more credits to break into making Caprice and Batty unnecessary and unfair.  In a strange way, I think we are both right!"

It focuses on fast early-game econ followed by either Breaking News for the kill, AstroTrain, or Midseason for the kill.  2) AstroBiotics. A fast-advance archetype that has been around for more than a year now, I think? Biotic Labor or SanSan City Grid end up with a scored AstroScript, then you ""ride the train"" by scoring the others.  The former is easier to play, the latter is slightly more resilient in my opinion. Let me know if you need deck lists.

I've been trying to find the right constellation of Clone Chips, Desperados and other things in Valencia, I'll give this setup a go.  One thing I'll mention is after playing a lot of Val, in the Wyldside+Chronotype setup, you're almost guarenteed to draw your entire deck if the game goes long. If it does, those I've Had Worse won't keep you safe at all. I've found going 2x IHW and 1x Plascrete is a bit safer if you're worried about meat damage decks.  If your meta is pretty light on those, 3x IHW might be fine.  And yes, if you have only 2x Clone Chip and Wyldside, you don't need Inject. Having to spend a Clone Chip to rescue a binned Corroder when you're much rather use that Clone Chip on D4v1d or Parasite is a bummer indeed."

Netrunner,3cf67p,Destiny_Cloud,4,Tue Jul 7 13:00:44 2015 UTC,"Immediate comments on the deck:  How often do you use Levy? Is it worth the deckslot over something else?  Have you thought about having one Legwork in the deck (possibly dropping one of the corroders)? You have no way of checking more than a single card in HQ at the moment, if you have a single Legwork, you can reuse it with Same Old Thing if you need to, and this will give you a way to pressure both HQ and R&D.  As for a corp deck, I'd probably try building a  kill deck out of Weyland. Core Weyland, all the transactions you can find, SEA source and triple scorched. Some good stopping ice like Ice Wall, try to rush out agendas. If the runner runs, kill them. If they don't, keep scoring. If you want a good win rate vs this deck I think it would work well, you have no protection vs damage, so a rich corp with kill cards in hand is very scary."
Netrunner,3cf67p,KnowledgeRuinsFun,3,Tue Jul 7 13:31:29 2015 UTC,"Good point on the Levy.  I don't use it often enough to warrant the deckslot.  I like the idea of a legwork.  Very strong card and can catch the corp off guard (especially with no Jackson to stop agenda flood).  Not sure what to replace the corroder with.  Battering ram just doesn't seem like a good enough replacement, but maybe I can live with just one fracter?  Keep in mind that 1x Core only has 2 scorched.  I can try to build a big money weyland deck anyway.  Money seems to be a sticking point for most corps with this card pool."
Netrunner,3cf67p,KnowledgeRuinsFun,3,Tue Jul 7 13:45:23 2015 UTC,"I think you can manage with one fracter. If you lose it you can always just Clone Chip it out. How often do you end up using Crypsis? I think most of the time you would have a way to fetch a more efficient breaker with Self-Modifying Code, Crypsis is pretty slow and expensive.  Money might be a problem with the current pool, but with base Weyland you have a lot of transactions. Both Medical Research Fundraiser and Successful Demonstration are 1 influence transactions. Successful demonstration are better earlygame, as once you hit lategame unsuccessful runs are fewer and far between.   You could try the Scorched-plan with only two Scorched Earth, but then you're really hoping they're not too far down the deck. or you need a way to get them. You could try Aggressive Negotiation to fetch one of them, but it's hard to use. Really, you'd normally want Project Atlas for that.  Alternatively you could try a HB fast-advance deck. HB Engineering the Future with money cards, try to score out Accellerated Beta Tests with Biotic Labor, trying to score other agendas behind taxing HB ice if that fails.  Without cards like Sweeps Week, Celebrity Gift and Restructure I think NBN and Jinteki might be too poor. Not sure though."
Netrunner,3cf67p,MagnumNopus,2,Tue Jul 7 13:59:47 2015 UTC,"Crypsis maybe breaks a piece of ice per game, assuming I draw it naturally.  I've just been used to adding it as a one-stop shop, but now that I can play with SMC (C&C was my most recent acquisition), I can see how it's really not necessary.  On the same vein of logic that only having one corroder is okay, then I guess I should drop the second Gordian as well.  Then add the third SoT and Maker's Eye, and something else?  I was looking at BaBW with a ton of transactions, maybe with space-ice?  I tried playing with aggressive negotiation, but it seemed really hard to pull it off.    I'll also try EtF, but I don't have much experience with fast-advance.  Thanks for all of your help :)"

There's no reason to splash Lawyer Up except to help Power Nap, since you can't tag yourself for any benefit. Combo cards like Power Nap are the kind of thing you throw in if you find you happen to have a lot of doubles already, rather than including sub-par cards just because you want to get this one to work. And if you're scrapping that engine you might want to ditch Prepaid Voice PAD as well.  You don't really have any way of getting any use out of Nasir's ability rather than Study Guide and SMC.

Other thoughts: * Same Old Thing has no quality targets, only cash or cards. Cards is better for this deck than others, true, but still very inefficient. * Public sympathy is cheap, but isn't enough by itself to make Beach party worth running. It's rare that you will get 5+ cards out of it, making it less good than Quality Time. * Net-Ready doesn't seem to be that strong here. You'd get the same effect more cheaply Personal Touch on Faust. * Faust without E3 seems weird. * Even if card draw is cheap, runs will be expensive. Almost no multi-access is rough."

If you go the Faust Route you can still do sympathy/game day thats fine, but then you can load up your deck with 3's of because you now have  a way to trash the useless cards in your hand. like 3 katies, or 3 net ready/order of sol that makes sure you get it out and now can use it as Faust bait."

I'll see if i can get a deck list, but he's running:   Box-E and Public Sympathy for hand size E3 Feedback Implants, Net-Ready Eyes and Personal Touch to work with Faust to lower card burn when needed.   Professional Contracts, Diesel, Game Day, I've Had Worse and Quality time for draw.     Personal Workshop and SMC to dump your credits before you lose them. Breaker Suite is just Faust and Mimic to deal with Swordsman.   My Advice:  Lose Lawyer Up, Power Nap and Lucky Find.  As many people have mentioned, it's a little too clever, and too many moving parts. Lose Plastcrete. If you can spare the influence, I've had worse is much better in this deck  Professional contracts works wonders in this deck - you want to be able to draw up, burn your credits on SMC or PW and then burn cards to break.

I also find the Sure Gambles interesting with Nasir, but if it works for you in testing, by all means! It seems you dont run Order of Sol or Personal Workshop so that may be the reason haha. I'm on the fence about them in this build myself given there aren't many targets, but the engine itself could make all that hardware uber cheap to play, and gives you a money dump. Excess copies are easily dumped for Faust :)  As another user mentioned, a singleton Gordian Blade to deal with Turing might be useful.  John Macaroni is a good include here. Keeps the engine rolling. Overall, it's super solid. I think what I like the most about this brew is how it gets around his biggest issue, which is money. Money to pump breakers, steal Fetal/NAPD/Future Perfect, money to trash assets like Caprice and SanSan, money to avoid Sea Scource/Midseasons, etc. That's why I was originally excited for Film Critic.

Its fast, its easy and it shows the game more than sufficiently for new players.  Also, I created some custom mats at Inkedplaymants (created is the wrong word, I used someone else's design and got them printed) because of all the different terminology and play areas, it made teaching people SOOO much easier, and besides, it looks cool.  I always used the HB and Shaper from the Core Set. I would ALWAYS give them the Corp deck as they could then see all cards being played.  Explain the basics ala the Stimhack article (great articles those), then get stuck in. I briefly touched on the runner side and just explain them as I go.   Sure it takes a while, answering questions etc and learning they have not hidden agendas etc but you don't take advantage of them. Deliberately run into traps, deliberately face check ice, run on last click etc etc. Show them the mechanics.   Whoever gets to 4 points first give them the choice of finishing, swapping or trying new decks (easy to do with the core set).  That has worked a TREAT. Every person I have demo'd has started playing. My must do tips....   ALWAYS LOSE. Never win the demo game...well not intentionally. You have to run R&D and HQ to show them the mechanics..luck is what it is. But if you know they have an agenda on that Remote...let them score it first. ALWAYS FOR AGGRESSIVE SEC. Nothing sucks a new player in than causing pain on their opponent. KEEP IT SIMPLE. Demo decks, not too many options...for new players all the new terminology is daunting, so keep it simple. STOCK MUST BE ON HAND. This is a must. Wherever you do the demo make SURE you know of somewhere with stock. An online retailer, a local store. There is no point getting someone interested if you don't hook them with stock to keep playing. This is always overlooked.    Once you have around 4 people...organise games. Round robin, etc. Just play games. We have started something locally combining the LGS and the Local Gaming Club. Its in its infancy...but its working.  One thing I will add. Once you get the point you are running ""organised games"" always have a runner and corp deck seperate for the ""I would like to play guys"". Even if they have only done a demo, get them playing. The Stimhack decks are great for this, and to be honest, use proxies for those decks (if you can't do them normally) just to get them hooked. I am in the process or organising this at the moment.

Netrunner,3cdhnt,Slothmano,2,Wed Jul 8 03:15:04 2015 UTC,"I've been teaching by making a simple corp deck and a simple runner deck and I will play corp and let the runner play with their hand face up. This lets me control how the game goes, I can put ice in educational places, I can give them advice on when and where to run, what cards to play, etc.  It's worked for me. There are benefits and detriments to play corp and runner when learning so there's no right answer."
Netrunner,3cdhnt,raydenuni,1 point,Tue Jul 7 17:33:15 2015 UTC,"Yeh I agree with this. I think it also depends on the experience of the player your teaching in terms of other card games.  Absolute Beginner - Letting them play Corp works, but at this point you are only teaching the basic mechanics, tactics are something for game 2-3.  Semi Experienced with other games - Give them the choice, after a brief explanation of ""fluff"" about the corp and the runner, let them play what interests them.  Largely Experience with say Magic - I have had more success with letting them play corp here. I find magic players struggle with the transition between the concepts and terminology (which is why the mat is perfect) however as an experienced player they can usually interpret the cards quicker.   I think you bring up a good point about doing what works for you and the new player. I have had occasions with my list above where they pick up the basics REALLY fast. Once I see they understand the difference between Agendas and Assets, how to ""score"" the Agendas and how ice work...I will usually see if they want to swap pretty fast, let them try a bit of everything quickly.  It is a unique game, which in turn makes it unique to teach people.   Keep it simple, nail the basics, keep it fun :)...until game 4...than destroy them mercilessly ;)"

Netrunner,3cdhnt,Mark5n,7,Wed Jul 8 01:07:22 2015 UTC,"There's a great little Stimhack series on it, check it out:    http://stimhack.com/teaching-netrunner-part-1/ http://stimhack.com/teaching-netrunner-part-2/ http://stimhack.com/teaching-netrunner-part-3/   That being said, while the decks here teach all the concepts of Netrunner, I find that they lack a hook or some kind of way for the new player to feel smart about what they are doing. For this reason, I have the new players play as Runner and specifically as either Pawnsop Noise or Logos Leela. Why? Because both of these IDs make the player quickly realize the mini-combos and over the course of the game have a chance to capitalize on them. This almost always makes them want to play another game.  Also, it really helps if you play your first few turns open-handed and read out cards whenever they are played. If they are getting stuck, just remind them that you can give them a hint. Note: this depends on the nature of the person you are playing against, if they don't respond well to this the first time don't push further.  Other things that might help are using pop culture to hook them in. Have they run into Neuromacer, Blade Runner, Ghost in the Shell, Tron, The Matrix before? Use these as ways to expose them to the flavor of the game. It helps give them short hands to remember cards. For example, popular names in my group: Raymond Flint - Humphrey Boggart, Kati Jones - Han Solo, Jackson Howard - Praise Jeebus, and Caprice Nisei - That BITCH!!! Whether or not these are accurate is not important, the point is it creates further investment in the game.  Worst-case scenario: play online. OCTGN/jinteki.net are places where there are games up pretty much 24/7. I've managed to meet a bunch of people that way who I now play regularly with. It seems we all have boring day jobs :)"

It would certainly seem that an access via Shiro would trigger R&D Interface and Medium (it would not put a virus counter on Medium).  If Shiro was on top of R&D, they could potentially multiaccess multiple times (though most cards would probably be repeats unless they trashed stuff).

Netrunner,3ceg5m,CorruptDropbear,5,Tue Jul 7 07:21:56 2015 UTC,"Well, right now you have the ""One Card That Everything In It's Type Will Be Judged By"" and then horizontal ""I prefer this because X"" cards. So here's the good utility cards that you will see in 99% of decks:  Runner Money  Sure Gamble - 1 click, pay five to get 9, or a net +4 credits. All money cards are based on this: you have to be cheaper and give less credits, or have a big downside. Aesop's is a good example of this: you have to trash something, and you get 3 credits, BUT you don't lose your click and it's on ""a stick"" (you can use it multiple times).   Runner Damage Prevention  Plascrete Carapace AKA Plastics - Prevents one Scorched Earth. There is no real net damage equivalent as net damage is usually dealt one at a time rather than ""8 damage on Corp's turn"". Yes. This is a silver bullet card. It's also the best utility against tag decks.   Runner Tags  Click, Pay 2 credits, remove 1 tag. All cards need to do better than this, which is why there's not a lot of tag removal in most decks, and instead a focus on just the meat damage prevention right now.   Runner Breakers  Corroder for Barrier  Gordian Blade for Code Gate  Ninja for Sentry  This is the ""Rainbow Suite"". It's all cards from Core Set and almost all Icebreakers are based around either being A) more expensive but more strength and abilities (Femme Fatale replacing Ninja), or B) being cheaper but weaker and having drawbacks (ZU.13/Zuul instead of Gordian Blade.   Datasucker rewards you for running and reduces your hunger for credits, and is the only card with influence that is just chucked in because it's just that damn good. It takes up the fourth slot in your four memory rig and it will win you games.   Runner Card Draw  Professional Contacts versus THE BABY. If you're not shaper, the decision is usually THE BABY, but inside it's a bit of a ""Is the 3 credits worth it?"" question.  Need more card draw, you'll go Wyldside in Anarch to lose a click or Earthrise Hotel to lose money and keep that precious influence.   As for consoles, they're usually faction specific and usually either give you a strong combo with your programs (Grimoire, Dinosaurus) or are good on their own at supporting you (Box-E, Astrolabe, Desperado).   A reminder: THERE ARE A LOT OF COMBO PIECES IN NETRUNNER, especially when considering your breakers. You've got Stealth cards that are useless without stealth credit options, a lot of AI breakers are good for combos but need backup, Eater decks, etc etc. Look at NetrunnerDB for some cool decks. :P"
Netrunner,3ceg5m,Rejusu,4,Tue Jul 7 09:54:41 2015 UTC,"Most of your points were good, though plascrete is a lot less prevalent than it used to be, but you lost me at Ninja. That hasn't been a popular card for a long time (if ever). The most prevalent sentry breaker is easily Mimic. And for card draw Diesel/QT is probably more widely played than ProCo in Shaper."
Netrunner,3ceg5m,CorruptDropbear,2,Tue Jul 7 10:23:11 2015 UTC,"Ninja is the one that is considered a baseline ""this is what to expect from a sentry breaker"". I'll agree that you'll see Mimic and Femme Fatale 90% of the time over Ninja, but they have their own downsides that go into the ""weaker but cheaper"" or ""stronger but expensive"" catagories.   Gordian Blade is the other card that has this issue, most will go Torch if they can afford it or Zuul/Cyber-Cypher combo if they can't afford one."
Netrunner,3ceg5m,Rejusu,1 point,Tue Jul 7 10:43:45 2015 UTC,I would say that Ninja is what to expect from a bad sentry breaker. Killers just don't have an equivalent to Gordian or Corroder. Those cards are the baselines for their types not simply because they are affordable but because of their sheer efficiency. Something which Ninja is sorely lacking. I don't think you can call anything the baseline of its type unless it actually sees play.

Netrunner,3ceg5m,WhoFly,1 point,Wed Jul 8 15:51:11 2015 UTC,"I'm not quite sure what you mean by utility. I think it means cards that can do multiple things or be useful in different situations, but I could be wrong.  Utility usually comes mostly in the form of what's lovingly referred to as ""Shaper BS"". Clone Chip and Self-Modifying Code, or SMC as you might see it called, are primary examples. Both allow you to search for and install cards that you need during any paid ability window. Yes, even during a run! Other ""tutor"" cards that allow you to search for specific cards: Special Order, Test Run, Scavenge, Retrieval Run, Djinn, Logos. Many cards in netrunner are very specific in their usage, so finding whichever card you currently need is the most utilitarian effect I can think of."

It's 11 credits and 10 clicks.  That's basically 9 quality times, except since you bought them in bulk, (and paid up front) you're paying ~1c per quality time, instead of 3c. 5 cards from quality time is already a little unwieldy.  Drawing 7 or 9 cards at once is almost guaranteed to force you to discard, unless you have increased handsize support. If you spend enough money to make it super-efficient, then you now have a pretty expensive resource on the board, that is vulnerable to both tagging, and all kinds of damage.

Ash, last chance (and best time) to rez is right after the runner commits to accessing - at this point you rez Ash and the run is successful, so his trigger is met. This doesn't change if there's no ICE on the server.  Same with JH, last chance to rez & use his 'remove from game' ability is after the runner has committed to accessing the server. No difference if there is no ICE on the server. Although this does open up fun plays - if there's no ICE and you remove Jackson from play, the run is neither successful nor unsuccessful.

This is where you want to rez Ash, Bernice Mai, Hokusai Grid etc.  However, the latest rez window BEFORE 4.3 is all the way back at 2.3. There are some places where you can use paid abilities, but you cannot rez cards. As Caprice is triggered when the runner passes the last piece of ice, and not when the run is successful, 4.3 is too late for Caprice, and you have to rez her at 2.3, in the same window as you rez the ice itself."

Netrunner,3ca4wx,firefrenchy,1 point,Mon Jul 6 09:58:14 2015 UTC,"the most important thing about the committing to access thing is that you can say ""Access?"" and if the runner says ""Yes"" they have passed priority, which is to say their last chance to use clone chip to get deus x, or their last chance to use a shard, or whatever else they might choose to do before accessing. Then you have your priority, and can flip up DRTs, or Ash, or use Jackson, or whatever.   Of course as already said, caprice is the exception so just rez her when you rez or choose not to rez your last ice before a server (although if people start playing drive by then just rez her earlier sometimes)"

Netrunner,3ca4wx,BlueSapphyre,1 point,Mon Jul 6 12:55:34 2015 UTC,"Caprice ends the run, so there's no successful run/access, while with Ash, you still get successful access triggers but can't access anything other than Ash if the trace is successful. It's a subtle but important difference."
Netrunner,3ca4wx,Lowsow,1 point,Mon Jul 6 13:10:24 2015 UTC,"It is deliberate. Wouldn't it be strange if you could use cards like emergency shutdown, or get Gabe's credits, after Caprice ended a run?"
Netrunner,3ca4wx,RestarttGaming,2,Tue Jul 7 10:39:09 2015 UTC,"See the timing of a run chart:  https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1597340_lg.jpg  Ash and jackson can both be used at any point up to 4.3.  4.3 is the usual step to rez it, because the user is committed to accessing at that point and can't jack out, and there's no reason to rez earlier, as if you rez it at any point before 4.3 they MIGHT have jacked out and made it un-necessary.  Caprice must be rezzed at step 2.3 before the last piece of ice encountered (or earlier, but again, no point).  This is when the runner has already committed to encountering the ice (can't just jack out in response, has to encounter the ice), but before they actually encounter/break it.  If there's no ice in front of caprice, she must be rezzed before the run is declared, before you know if the runner is going to run or not.  Once they declare a run on a no ice server, it's too late to use caprice if she's unrezzed.    So the general rules are:  For ash and jackson, you can and should use them after the runner has passed all the ice and after the runner has declared they will continue into the server and not jack out, but directly before the success/access.  For caprice, if theres no ice, she needs to be rezzed before the runner decides they want to run.  If there's ice, she should be rezzed after the runner has committed to encountering the last piece of ice in a server, (basically the same time you're deciding to rez that piece of ice or not)."

What is the last chance for a runner to use a paid ability in a run? I believe it's also before access correct? So, for example, if you have leftover stimhack credits mid-run as a Shaper, the last chance you have to spend those is before you access.

They could even just engineer clones that are absolutely loyal to the political ideologies of their employers, allowing corporations to literally buy votes.

You might not engineer votes directly, but you could create a more easily manipulated population. The specifics of such a program are beyond my capacity to argue, but I don't think it's unreasonable to say that no rules can be applied to Jinteki to keep them from dirty dealings.

PPVP econ gets better and better the later the game goes, and punishing them for not drawing one quickly is the #1 way to get easy wins vs Kate, (and forcing them to run rather than draw for more PPVPs is the hard way)."

Going fast enough with the right icecan force the shaper to greatly inconvenience themselves. You need high impact cards that force Kate to stop auto-piloting her get-all-the-money plan and run your remote. Shapers' board states and tempo can be manipulated if you know how to force them into suboptimal decisions like recurring Sharpshooter early instead of using a clone chip for an SMC to find a missing breaker. Only rezzing 1 mimic-able ice in a key location early (or better yet, changeling to force Atman4 or Datasucker too) is a prime example in a lot of decks now; and each time you force a remote run to make her pull out a heap trick or SMC you ate collapsing more and options for her other than give up an agenda to you which she regains tempo.   Barrier heavy is also key (and the new hotness with NRE Yog around), taxing out Lady counters. This means in order to preserve recursion for Lady they must play slower otherwise, saving Clone Chips and maybe an SMC for back-up Ladys (remember the typical 1-of Scavenge too), and having to draw into other breakers manually. A varied ice selection is key, and RP and Weyland have the best suites of gear checks and recursion punishment right now."

I think it's a neat trap though.  Blacklist. Oh, Blacklist. I think this card should see more play than it does, especially with all the Prepaid Kate out there. I mean, it's really great against any archives digger, which is most Shaper/Anarch in some way. I'd be inclined to at least try 2x for a while and see how they work in practice. So often things in this game work so much better once you finally see them ""in motion"".  In fact, I've been trying to put 2x Blacklists in the new Jinteki deck I'm building."
Netrunner,3c83e4,ItJustGotRielle,1 point,Mon Jul 6 15:47:16 2015 UTC,"High risk is great, the problem is scoring it in the first place. Reversed accounts is sort of the same. The problem is not so much when she gets a billion credits and just sits on it, the problem is usually how she can bullshit twenty credits out of nowhere.  Blacklist is okay, but very narrow and not that good against her - other Shapers have a worse time. Student loans is the same, it's okay, but it's a pretty big investment from you, and won't usually deny the runner that many credits."
Netrunner,3c83e4,miller_highlife,1 point,Sun Jul 5 20:15:10 2015 UTC,"Student Loans as a one-of is substantial and worth running in the right deck. It is exactly the right card for non-glacier Weyland; a card you set behind a piece of ice you want them to find a breaker for. It's fetchable with Boot Camp so it's not crazy to go get it. Once they Atman4 your changeling or Gordian your Enigma, bounce the ice and put it on R&D. Put a new gear check on your remote& drop an agenda in. She'll Maker's you, probably hit a snare, and everyone wins. Now clear the tag and give me my Atlas please."
Netrunner,3c83e4,llama66613,3,Mon Jul 6 15:12:13 2015 UTC,Prepaid Kates usually use The Maker's Eyes (and maybe an Indexing) for R&D multiaccess. Putting a Crisium Grid / Caprice Nisei there after you ice it up decently makes for a very cost-effective defense.
Netrunner,3c83e4,llama66613,2,Mon Jul 6 04:24:33 2015 UTC,"GOING FAST AGAINST THIS DECK IS REALLY, REALLY HARD   Eh, I'd cut the ""REALLY, REALLY"". Two pieces of binary ice + Power Shutdown for SMCs and you can get an agenda out in the early game."
Netrunner,3c83e4,RUBY_FELL,14,Sun Jul 5 20:54:28 2015 UTC,Thats means having:  Two pieces of ice with different types and an end the run  Enough money to rez them  A power shutdown  All while not giving her easy makers eyes
Netrunner,3c83e4,Gammaran,1 point,Sun Jul 5 20:59:59 2015 UTC,"Right, I should say, if your deck is built for it, it's not that hard. If you're a glacier deck with mostly big ice, you'll want to wait for a super taxing remote. But for rush decks, all of those conditions are relatively easily met."

But you Power Shutdown, you install more ice, and you put another one in there.  If you play 3 Snare! and 2 Fast Track you don't even have to ice centrals, especially if she's on 1 Indexing.  I was testing the GRNDL / Kate matchup with a sparring partner and we found that GRNDL could win pretty regularly.  Generally, I think fast play out of HB with a Crisium splash is the way to go, though.  I had a bitch of a time with that at Regionals, more so than with RP or NEH, actually.    it's occasionally possible to OUTLAST HER   If the game goes long you've pretty much lost, IMO.  It's all about making her run your remote before the econ engine comes online.  And it's worth defending centrals lightly to push this issue."
Netrunner,3c83e4,MrLabbes,6,Sun Jul 5 22:18:32 2015 UTC,"As a long time rush/supermodernism deck player and also the main contributor of the PPVP Kate popularity, I think even if it's easy for GRNDL/Supermodernism to get out their 3-4 first points, they will NEVER close out the game against Kate barring perfect draw for the corp and really shitty one for the runner."
Netrunner,3c83e4,neutronicus,1 point,Mon Jul 6 00:13:23 2015 UTC,"I dunno, man, it was playing like a coin toss.  Fast Track and Oaktown Renovation really accelerate that kind of play, since you can go go broke scoring the Atlas and then immediately start scoring the Oaktown."
Netrunner,3c83e4,MrLabbes,3,Mon Jul 6 13:31:39 2015 UTC,"You still haven't close the game with just atlas and oaktown scored ;).  The hard part is always closing out the game in this matchup, not scoring your first two agendas."

Netrunner,3c9uzy,Judge___Holden,21,Mon Jul 6 06:00:01 2015 UTC,"So here's how this works -  The key takeaway here is that none of these things actually happen simultaneously.  Even if you just have three data foldings in play, each one happens one at a time in an order you choose.  When your turn begins, put an imaginary token on every card that has a ""when your turn begins"" effect.  Then, one by one, chose cards with those imaginary tokens on them and resolve their effects.  if a new ""beggining of turn"" card comes into play because of one of these effects, it wont have the imaginary token (because it wasn't in play when everything else got the tokens), so wont take effect.  However, do note that adjusted chronotype doesn't trigger off of start of turn, but off of losing a click, so in your case you can do it so it does or so it doesn't work.  At the start of your turn, both Supplier and wyldside will ""go off"".  You can choose the order.  If you choose to use supplier first, you can install adjusted chronotype.  Then, when wyldside ""goes off"", adjusted chronotype will be in play when you lose a click, so will give you your click back.  If Choose wyldside first, then you draw two and lose a click, Then you install adjusted, so it's not in play when you lose a click, so wont get you your click back.  So always just chose to install the adjusted off of supplier first.  Datafolding and underworld contacts work the same way.    Supplier, data folding 1, data folding 2, and underworld contact will all ""go off"" when your turn starts, and you choose the order to resolve them in.  So you can choose to do your data foldings/underworld first and have the credits to install something off of supplier, or not.  Please note if you have a data folding on a supplier and thats all you have in play, the turn will start, ONLY the supplier will trigger, and it will install the data folding (if you choose to).  Since the turn has already started, you do NOT get the data folding credit this turn, as that specific data folding wasn't in play when the turn began."
Netrunner,3c9uzy,RestarttGaming,2,Mon Jul 6 06:13:53 2015 UTC,This is the best explanation I've seen of this! It also explains how you can install something like a Dyson Mem Chip off the supplier and get to trigger your UC or Data Folding if they're already installed.
Netrunner,3c9uzy,unitled,2,Mon Jul 6 07:40:17 2015 UTC,"Thanks!  I can't take all the credit - I used to know the rules for this backwards and forwards technically but have a tough time explaining it to ""non-rulesy"" people, and someone in reddit used a ""bell ring"" metaphor for the start of the turn, and only those in play heard it, and it just seemed to make so much intuitive sense to non-rulesy people that i've used similar explanations every sense.  Also, for anyone still having doubts, Lukas did in fact confirm what /u/unitled said is true (https://www.reddit.com/r/Netrunner/comments/2pixjs/ruling_clarification_from_lukas_on_conditional/) so it all checks out.  happy day!"
Netrunner,3c9uzy,RestarttGaming,1 point,Mon Jul 6 09:34:08 2015 UTC,"I was running a deck that used Dyson and UC at the Nationals and just about every game that it came up in my opponent wasn't sure of the exact rules (judge had to be called over once to confirm I was right!). I've seen the 'bell ring' metaphor somewhere before, so that was probably you, but the token thing works even better I think. Thank you!"
Netrunner,3c9uzy,unitled,1 point,Mon Jul 6 13:58:03 2015 UTC,"The Supplier is a great teaching example for how start of turn timing works.

Netrunner,3c9uzy,Wily-Odysseus,1 point,Mon Jul 6 17:26:28 2015 UTC,"Another combo based on start of turn triggers is Theophilius Bagbiter and Supplier.  Using supplier, you can install Theophilius from the Supplier before taking credits off of drip economy (UC/DF/Daily Casts) to soften the blow of installing him.  Still not very good, but it's something."
Netrunner,3c9uzy,FricasseeToo,1 point,Mon Jul 6 16:57:21 2015 UTC,"I believe you can remove Adjusted Chronotype from The Supplier before triggering Wyldside. My reasoning is that Adjusted Chronotype is not attached to ""When your turn begins"". It simply triggers the first time you lose a click.  When turn begins:   Choose The Supplier trigger: Install Adjusted Chronotype Choose Wyldside trigger: Adjusted Chronotype is active so it will refund your lost click.    As to your other question. I believe your credit pool can be in flux during ""When your turn begin"" triggers. You can gain credits from one ""When your turn begins"" and use the gained credits to pay for another ""When your turn begins""."

Netrunner,3c7xtt,PoorRover,10,Sun Jul 5 19:09:19 2015 UTC,OCTGN might be a good way to get back in without the price tag (play online essentially) and would let you try out cards before you buy. This would let you decide if you want to buy in to the latest.  It's also on demand provided players are online so you can play around your schedule

Some things are a little annoying (e.g. you can only increment your credits one by one, recurring credits not automatically spent, feels slower than OCTGN....), but other things are better than in OCTGN (like looking at your heap is only a single click, you select decks before the start of the game etc.).   And, being a webapp, you don't need to install something on your machine, and it works on all platforms."

Netrunner,3c7xtt,Xercies_jday,9,Sun Jul 5 21:05:17 2015 UTC,To be honest ive never felt this game you need the latest stuff to be competitive I mean just look at some netrunner videos there are people still playing trad andysucker...just make decks with what you have and try them have fun...the newest cards i feel are like ooo i want to try this super new thing out...there are a load of old cards that can do the same i feel.
Netrunner,3c7xtt,jkopplin,9,Sun Jul 5 22:22:17 2015 UTC,I agree with this to a point. You don't need to own all the new cards to stay competitive but you need to be aware of the new cards. Imagine showing up with an Astro Biotics deck and not knowing that Clot was a card now. But as long as you look at spoilers occasionally you can be fine. We have the full cardpool but my wife just noticed she's not using in anything in her Current CT Stimshop build past the Spin Cycle.
Netrunner,3c7xtt,Xercies_jday,3,Mon Jul 6 01:11:27 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah you totally need to be aware of the cards but thats kind of easier, the internet will be talking about those cards."
Netrunner,3c7xtt,gibed,2,Mon Jul 6 08:30:00 2015 UTC,"You might need the latest packs to win tournaments, but speaking as someone who does not have the full set, you can still do very well against better-equipped players by playing well-thought-out decks and making sure you've at least read the text of new cards."

Netrunner,3c7xtt,WolfOne,5,Mon Jul 6 15:15:49 2015 UTC,"Honestly, the unfortunate fact of the matter is that you will lose if you do not keep up with the meta: not because the new cards that are being released are more powerful, but because you're simply not familiar enough with them to know what they do.  If you were only familiar with Core and I sat you across someone playing Prepaid Kate, you'll very likely lose because the very idea that anyone can bounce back to 9 credits from 0 - or that they can tutor for programs or recur programs mid-run - is insane to you.  IMO, you don't need to keep up with the new packs in order to have fun.  Sure, your win rate may suffer, but you can definitely still have a great time with a limited card pool.  All you'll need to do is find a deck (or type of deck) that you enjoy playing, and play that!  Like mindgames?  Play Cambridge Jinteki.  Like taxing glaciers?  ETF.  You get the idea.  Go in without the expectations and/or pressures of winning, and you'll be fine."
Netrunner,3c7xtt,dodgepong,1 point,Mon Jul 6 01:50:59 2015 UTC,"Yeah, true. It'd also be annoying to play against someone who was always like ""oh, what's that ice do?.."""

Netrunner,3c7xtt,RestarttGaming,2,Mon Jul 6 08:43:13 2015 UTC,"You can play very competitive decks with cards up through The Source if you need to.

Netrunner,3c7xtt,musiccontrolsus,2,Mon Jul 6 07:22:27 2015 UTC,"You definitely don't need ""all the newest stuff"" to be competitive. In fact, as you may have gleaned from other conversations about this cycle, some cards don't really come into their own until their supporting cards are released later in the cycle.   I was going through a slump myself. After a recent store championship, I kept buying the new packs but pretty much didn't play for over a month. I started to wonder the same things. But playing casually last week again with some janky builds was a lot of fun. It just really drives it home for me: buy what you want. Play how you want. Have fun!"
Netrunner,3c7xtt,RestarttGaming,2,Mon Jul 6 18:51:36 2015 UTC,"Online services like jinteki.net and octgn are free ways to play, and are even less time commitment, since you don't have to go anywhere to play.  Some people in my playgroup don't own all the cards and still participate.  Here's how.  A) drafts.  Have everyone pitch in for a draft set or two and run 2-4 drafts a month.  Free after the initial investment(unless you decide to make it a prized tournament with entry fees), everyone plays with the same cardpool, and it's fun and different every time.  B) leagues.  Our area runs a league where each season lasts about 2 months.  At the beginning of the season you get a list of players you have to face and what id you'll have to face each one with( though you don't know your opponents id s).  There's also a list of what packs each player owns, and you can only use cards that both players own for that match.  So the card pools are always equal for each match and you have to use a lot of id's you might not normally see.  C) agree to a cardpool and play like minded players with that.  Either have a core set only league, or core+deluxe expansions, or whatever."
Netrunner,3c7xtt,musiccontrolsus,2,Sun Jul 5 21:10:44 2015 UTC,Hi. Can you expand on the Drafts format a little? I'd not heard of Draft format NetRunner play. Is it something I can get my local shop to bring in?
Netrunner,3c7xtt,RestarttGaming,1 point,Mon Jul 6 11:21:42 2015 UTC,"Sure!  Here's a good reference as well: https://www.fantasyflightgames.com/en/products/android-netrunner-draft-play/  Basically, when playing draft, you dont use any netrunner cards anyone already owns/uses.  Instead, drafts use specially designed ""draft packs"", and you use a very neutral special draft ID.  These only use cards from the regular card pool, but the card pool is limited to certain cards to be balanced and interesting with a draft, so one might feature tracing/trace punishment, and etc.   There are currently 3 different draft sets that take on different parts of the card pool, using different themes and play experiences:  you pick which of the three draft sets you want to play, and each player needs three different packs - a runner pack, a corp pack, and a starter pack.  The starter pack you open, look at, and keep - it's the exact of cards for everyone.  The specific cards depend on which draft set you choose, but they always have enough agendas for a deck, 2 of a runner econ card, 2 of a corp econ card, 2 of some breaker that can handle any type of ice (like crypsis or chameleon), so at the very minimum you can build a deck that has a chance of winning, no matter what.  So you look at this pack of cards where everyone gets the same cards and you know what you definitely have.  Then you crack the corp pack.  It contains 4 mini packs.   You take one card from your mini pack and pass the rest one direction again and again till are the cards are gone from that mini pack.  Then you repeat it with the next mini pack and the other direction.  once all four of the corp ones are gone, you do the runner.  Then you take all the cards you've drafted and make two decks with your neutral IDs (minimum 30 cards 6 agendas).  Then you play!  Usually round robin stlye    When you're done you return all the cards and you can remake the draft packs again through some online randomizers.  So you buy 1 corp/runner/starter draft pack per person, and you can host an infinite number of drafts, which a different experience each time."
Netrunner,3c7xtt,sabreo001,1 point,Mon Jul 6 19:51:42 2015 UTC,Oh wow. That sound excellent.  How does it compare to using a Demo deck to teach Netrunner?  Or is it an intermediate type thing where it's best where people who understand the cards do it?
Netrunner,3c7xtt,WolfOne,1 point,Mon Jul 6 21:35:44 2015 UTC,"Demo decks are still a much better way to teach netrunner.    To draft you want to understand netrunner decently well so you can judge which cards are good or not when you're drafting.  You also need to recognize what a good deck composition is and how to craft good decks on the fly, which is a skill only learned with time playing netrunner."
Netrunner,3c7xtt,musiccontrolsus,1 point,Mon Jul 6 21:41:44 2015 UTC,"Without sounding like a relationship column piece, have you tried talking to your meta friends and asking if they would occasionally play just the packs you own?

Netrunner,3c7xtt,WolfOne,7,Sun Jul 5 21:37:27 2015 UTC,"Honestly, i wouldn't. Not out of spite or elitism, it's just that it's a big hassle to keep track of another person's collection and rebuild your decks to accomodate it. It would take up a lot of precious play time.

Netrunner,3c7xtt,musiccontrolsus,2,Mon Jul 6 08:45:09 2015 UTC,At the moment my current community is going through a recruit and build phase to try and drill up interest so the few of us that still play have dropped back to Single Core Set (SCS) and are building decks from that. It's an experience!  We've had some great results building some not too bad decks from SCS and teaching people how to play with them.
Netrunner,3c7xtt,WolfOne,2,Mon Jul 6 11:20:07 2015 UTC,"I have played core set only way too much to go back at it again, but I get what you mean.

I'm a relatively new player as well, but I know enough to know that this question is super, super broad. There are many aspects to deck building: What is your economy package? How does that synergize with your breaker suite? Event heavy? Resource heavy? How do you plan to deal with damage/tags?  How are you looking to win? The three main runner strategies I've found are the Hunter, Digger, and Harvester. You usually focus on one with another as a back-up. Here is the article I'm getting these ideas from.  Corp decks usually have similar questions: What's your economy package? How does that complement your ICE? Are you using binary taxing ICE? Analog ETR ICE? Fast Advance? Kill? Rush? Some combination thereof?  Again, how do you plan to win? Fast advance agendas out before the runner can threaten them? Tricksy Jinteki mind games? SeaScorched? Here's a good article on ICE types.  I hope this helps. I watch a lot of matches online to get a feel for what common deck types are and what ""the meta"" is doing right now. I really enjoy PeachHack out of Atlanta. Lots of good well-produced videos coming from that channel, and very good players and decks featured."
Netrunner,3c97sw,GarlicSausage,1 point,Mon Jul 6 02:39:36 2015 UTC,I've mostly been going with an Anarchist Noise deck that works with a lot of viruses. It worked against my friends who started me in this game but it tanked against other players in local tournaments. My Corp deck is an HB deck that I have been tweaking with over and over. I like it and I like playing the corp for the structure of the deck and play style. I just started playing with a Shaper deck using Chaos Theory and a Monolith. The Big Girls play with Monoliths is what I based the shaper deck off of. I don't have everything for it but I think I made a nice working build.
Netrunner,3c97sw,TragadorD,1 point,Mon Jul 6 03:27:32 2015 UTC,"Choose a starting point. Do you want to base your deck around breakers, economy or identity? Then add in necessary economy, breaker cards, choose an identity, add in support cards and card draw, and you're sorted."
Netrunner,3c97sw,TragadorD,1 point,Mon Jul 6 09:12:25 2015 UTC,"This.  There are so many aspects to building each deck it really helps to pick a focal point and start there.  Then you can go in bit by bit and build around that focal point.  I usually reserve the last couple cards to shoring up where I see the newly built deck as weak.  Is my economy contingent on landing runs? Will fast advance take me apart?  How do I deal with high strength ice?  Another question I never asked myself when I first started and now ask every single time I get done with a deck.  Would this deck be better with another ID?  If the answer is yes, you have some thinking to do.    Welcome to the game!"

Borrowed Satellite costs the same amount of money and a lot of influence for very little gain. It dies hard to Butchershop as well, which is a huge liability in the current meta. I'd also cut the Breach, since you have Corroder and Spikes. The 1-of Career Fair seems an easy cut as well, since none of your resources really profit from it."
Netrunner,3c8n9i,MrLabbes,1 point,Mon Jul 6 09:42:05 2015 UTC,"The borrowed satellite is wasted influence I feel. The majority of the time Forger should be all you need, and worst case if you have to trash it to dodge a tag you lose a couple of disposable breakers. The influence you're spending on it could be used then for another clone chip or a levy (which will let you stay in the game if it runs long). You should also go down to 45 cards ideally and career faire isn't doing much work without satellite. Also no Peddler? It's a solid include in Geist and definitely has better synergy than the stimhack. What do you need that burst econ for? You're playing criminal.  Consider swapping the Zu for Rex too. You don't need everything to live in the cloud, and you really don't need Breach when you have Corroder and Spike. This again will free up more influence to be spent on stuff you don't already have access to in faction."

Netrunner,3c7a7s,BinarySecond,2,Sun Jul 5 15:56:28 2015 UTC,"This is definitely interesting but I really disagree with your assessment of Geist with Cloud breakers. You aren't meant to build up a big rig of them before you start running. The point of packing in so many of them is that you draw them early, throw down a couple and run aggressively, using them to break and leveraging Geists ability. If you're sitting there trying to install breakers until they're 4-5 strength then you're doing it wrong. Cloud breakers are best used in Geist for early game aggression and for draw power to set up your mid-late game. And once you have a few actual breakers out they're good for efficiently breaking medium strength multi sub ICE that would otherwise be more taxing. Hitting an Ichi with a shiv is particularly delicious.  By contrast I feel that your deck has a longer setup time (Underworld Contacts is always going to be slow in anything expect Sunny decks) and is less aggressive, especially with the lack of multi access."
Netrunner,3c7a7s,azraelng,2,Mon Jul 6 09:21:31 2015 UTC,"I like your ideas, street peddler is a really good fit with Geist, it's almost like a special delivery but with Levy and Clone Chips you don't mind losing some so much. I like the off campus apartment, especially if you're going hard on connections.

Netrunner,3c7a7s,FricasseeToo,1 point,Sun Jul 5 23:38:57 2015 UTC,While the best Geist deck may not need them (though I believe they are good in him) I don't think they're that great in any other deck. Without the card draw that Geist adds to them you may as well just run a normal breaker suite and pack the deck with econ instead.

Netrunner,3c500m,leastfixedpoint,43,Sat Jul 4 21:07:50 2015 UTC,"Ok, so this will be a long one.  We'll start with how statistics work, and move on to external factors and trends that skew them.  ready?  here we go!  So first off we're going to assume completely random opponents and opponents decks for everyone.  When this happens, the amount of games played is just an indication of how trustworthy the winrate is.    If two decks have a 80% winrate, but one won 4/5 games, and one 800/1000, statistically you have NO information that tells you which deck might be better.  More games does not equal better.  You cannot assume either way.  What you can tell is that the true power of the 1000 games deck is probably really close to that 80% mark (maybe 89 or 91).   but that other deck that only 5 games were played with, you're not very confident in that being the accurate winrate.  The real power level could be 99%, and they just got the bad game early, or 60%, and they just got lucky one game.  So, with all other things being equal, if you have the same winrate then you can't tell which deck is better, only which deck is more likely to be accurately defined.  In addition, i believe the 50% luck figure you give is EXTREMELY too high.  The fact remains that tournament after tournament and year after year, the same names keep popping up in the top8 of large tournaments.  This means that player skill is an extremely large factor, and randomness isn't a large enough factor to overcome that.  In addition, in a given timeframe, the top8 of various major tournaments across the globe often include mostly the same several decks, with a few oddities here and there.  That again points to the strength of the deck ALSO outweighing randomness, for the most part.  Thus, even if there were no other factors at all, both piloting and composition are each individually bigger factors than luck, leaving it less than a third (yes this assumes piloting and composition are statistically separate factors, which they often aren't, but considering there are other factors as well that would push back the other way, i've chosen to zero that out in our simplistic analysis)  Now, we dive into some assumptions.  First off, playing casual games is fundamentally different from a tournament.  In a tournament winners are promoted and loser demoted, where as in a casual setting you face a random distribution of opponents.  Thus, a winning tournament deck faces, on average, harder opponents/decks then casual play.  The same deck might have an 80% casual winrate but a 60% tournament winrate.  In addition, often times the online services (jinteki/octgn) are used for people to quickly test out new ideas against a variety of decks before assembling them in real life, arranging a time to meet down at the FLGS, arranging to have a friend build and learn how to play a variety of different decks, and playing through a bunch of games.  Thus, online, you'll face an relatively higher percentage of untested, untuned, experimental decks, making your winrate with a tested deck online higher than it would be in other situations.  even if you play casually in person, you're probably playing several times against the same people and same decks, so your winrate against the field in general will be skewed when compared to facing random opponents at a major tournament.  So what this all adds up to is - amount of games played doesn't make your deck ""better"" or ""worse"" than another deck with the same winrate - just more likely to be an accurate winrate. Online casual winrates are usually artifically inflated vs tournament winrates The consistent performance of a deck across wide areas with different pilots, and the consistent performance of certain players with different decks point to luck being a much lower factor than either of those, and nowhere near 50%.    8-0 in one tournament is still an unreliable datapoint.  Statistically, even bad decks can go 8-0 in a tournament with an extreme amount of luck.  and if your local store only have 8 players and 2 are terrible, 4 are ok, and two are really good, you really only have to get lucky once, vs the other really good person, to win with even an OK ish deck.  On the other hand, going 8-0 in an invitational tournament for regional winners only would mean a heck of a lot.  So really, you'd have to know the story behind it to get any feel for if that 8-0 means anything or not.  But it's no more reasonable to assume they ""got lucky"" then they ""got unlucky"" and still went 8-0, powered by a truely amazing deck and player.  You just don't know, not enough data.  8-0 in a minor tournament might want to be noticed, but doesn't necessarily mean anything.  If the deck goes undefeated or almost undefeated in a large tournament with stiff competition, look at it, and if it or decks like it perform well across multiple tournaments, then take a look.  So if your question is ""Does going 8-0 in one tournament make it an awesome deck?""  The answer is no.  It could be luck, lack of competition, surprise factor, a great player, a weird meta, any number of things.  But it doesn't make it a ""lucky"" deck or a bad one either, you just don't know.  If your question is really ""can I assume my deck, which has a decent casual online winrate, is as good as most tournament winning decks"", the answer to that is also ""probably not"", because casual online winrates are inflated, you're subject to just as much luck as them so if you play enough games you should get just as lucky as some point if both you and the deck are just as good, and a variety of other factors."
Netrunner,3c500m,RestarttGaming,6,Sat Jul 4 21:57:46 2015 UTC,"This is all great.  One thing you don't mention is that a lot of deck performance is linked to how familiar the player is with a deck, and the player's skill.   If a deck went 8-0 in a tournament for you, it's probably quite good for you."
Netrunner,3c500m,SiggNaturStyle,2,Sun Jul 5 00:10:35 2015 UTC,"Also an 8-0 deck may be solid for that meta. If you know everyone is playing Deck X then you can build Deck Y to deal with it, even if it has a terrible winrate against Decks B and C.  Solid writeup!"
Netrunner,3c500m,PJNifty,2,Sun Jul 5 06:46:52 2015 UTC,"So if your question is ""Does going 8-0 in one tournament make it an awesome deck?"" The answer is no. It could be luck, lack of competition, surprise factor, a great player, a weird meta, any number of things.    To take an example of this, recall the Silhouette Quest Completed deck that took down Chicago regionals? At the time, it did pretty well against RP decks, completely subverting the Caprice/Ash lock. However, since then, I don't think anything similar has placed well in any large tournament. While I don't intent to disparage the creator or player of the deck, a large part of the reason why it did so well was surprise. Now that it's out in the open, people know that putting Caprice on the remote won't have much effect, while placing her on a central really messes with Quest Completed."

Netrunner,3c500m,RestarttGaming,6,Mon Jul 6 06:18:54 2015 UTC,A deck going X-0 in a tournament has a lot more to do with the relative strength of the player to the rest of the players in the tournament than it does with the strength of the deck against the alternatives.
Netrunner,3c500m,Calc3,7,Sat Jul 4 23:23:19 2015 UTC,"The ""quality"" of tournaments vary a lot. Just because someone said they went X-0 in a tournament doesn't mean much really, unless you know what kind of decks and players they went against."
Netrunner,3c500m,flamingtominohead,5,Sat Jul 4 21:17:24 2015 UTC,"Going X-0 in tournaments means nothing in terms of a deck's strength. As a quick illustration as to why, if someone goes 7-0 with a deck but also go 0-7 with their other deck, their opponents probably weren't very good and the whole thing seems a lot less impressive.  There's no guarantee about the quality of the players they played against, and certainly, a good player can X-0 with any half-decent deck if they're the best player in the room, or a half decent player can get super lucky with a deck and go X-0 with it.  As far as the ""I went X-0 with this at the past few tournaments!"" is concerned: in short, one person's good experience doesn't make a deck good. There are many extraneous factors involved and I'm sure it's just as likely that they X-0 with another deck. I'm sure that basically every ID and every archetype has gone X-0 at a tournament somewhere throughout the world. Single-tournament results should not persuade you one bit.  As for OCTGN/Jinteki.net, almost exactly half of the field are below-average Netrunner players. If a deck has an 80% winrate against below-average players and a 40% winrate against good players, you could still boast a 60% winrate, but that doesn't really mean the deck is good or top tier competitive. Winrate doesn't mean anything because you don't know the quality of the players you were playing against, and if you're even slightly above average, chances are your deck will have a >50% winrate regardless of what it is."
Netrunner,3c500m,Xenasis,2,Sat Jul 4 22:04:09 2015 UTC,"At high levels winrate is mostly player skill with deck composition being a distant second and luck heavily affecting very few games (65/32/3 if you want arbitrary numbers). However, most of the time I see undefeated at a tournament, and the deck looks outdated or just mediocre, I assume it wasn't a very strong tournament. Stimhack events, large regionals and anrpc finals get consistently strong turnouts, but outside that there's no guarantee of playing against talented players"
Netrunner,3c500m,itsbigfoot,1 point,Sun Jul 5 04:34:34 2015 UTC,"In my experience, to qualify for the top tables of a tournament you need to win around 85% of your games. And yet people consistently make it to the top tables so luck should not be a big factor.  Having a good deck is not much of a factor because anyone who is good will have a one and will probably manage to beat you even if you don't. Having a new, unexpected new deck does give you a huge edge but it's not common, if simply because creating a brand new powerful deck is not something that happens everyday.  Personally, I feel that luck accounts for 1.0-1.5 game losses at my typical tournament. That is, I normally expect to blow up a game (be it as Runner or as Corp) because I drew poorly or had an awful matchup once per tournament. And I'm not a great player, so probably that 0.5 extra loss is caused by my lack of skill more than actual luck."
Netrunner,3c500m,ErikTwice,1 point,Sun Jul 5 07:33:56 2015 UTC,"I think it shows the player strength with the deck. I know a guy who's went undefeated with his corp at Worlds (iirc) and then when I tried piloting it I did terribly. Damage Jinteki is not for everybody, and clearly he knows his deck well"
Netrunner,3c500m,TonyStellato,1 point,Sat Jul 4 23:09:00 2015 UTC,"It shows some of the effect of a deck, I would expect. While overall, a 70/30 data points on like Octgn and Jinteki would be more telling of the true power of a deck, and certainly pilot skill needs to be taken into account, it does matter some.  The fact is that at a tournament most players are going to be playing to win. Round one or two you may get some weird guys who aren't, or who are just messing around, but if your decks are winning, and your at the top, then you are going to be playing against other players who are playing the same way. Pushing hard to get the best scores possible. Saying your deck went 8-0 against that kind of pressure, is respectable. Certainly though, its because the player knew their deck and knew how to pilot it most effectively."

IHW+Pancake Party really isn't enough in my experience, especially when a decently sized server is concerned. If you're going to focus on Faust as your main breaker you're better off dropping your origamis, memstrips, etc in favor of something like Public Sympathy that just works.

But the learning curve for OCTGN is worth it, in my opinion, because it's automation is just better.    EDIT: It should be noted that Jinteki continues to make amazing progress on their way to a full-fledged, fully automated Netrunner client.  It should also be noted that OCTGN is always up to date and has a brilliant and dedicated individual working diligently behind the scenes to keep us playing.  He does it all by himself."

Just make a deck using all the cards from the set, for both runner and corp, doesn't need to be a valid deck. Then load those the the Ogctgn deck builder, and click on each new card in your list. It will create proxy cards in the OCTGN folder. Now go save out images from NetDB and rename those images to match the long numbered names of the proxies, place them one folder up from the proxies then delete the proxies, and leave the proxy folder there but empty. Good stop gap until better scans come in."

They already have a bunch of netrunner themed ones, plus you can just use any super high rez image you like and crop it to the right size.  Search the internet and this forum for awesome past examples (people have replaced the people in famous paintings like the last supper and the nighthawks with netrunner figures, people have done custom netrunner style designs, anything you think of can be done)."

Netrunner,3c0g9e,dormio,13,Fri Jul 3 17:16:52 2015 UTC,"Yes. If you take a look at the timing diagram (back of the rule book/FAQ and available online at Ancur ), you can see that all the paid ability windows [edit: on the corp's turn before the discard phase] are also scoring windows for the corp. Review also the rules on timing priority.   So yes in that situation you never have to pass priority back to the Runner until you are completely done acting in that window (acting = rezzing cards, using paid abilities, and scoring agendas)."
Netrunner,3c0g9e,Jakodrako,4,Fri Jul 3 17:34:27 2015 UTC,Does this mean that the corp can score an over-advanced Oaktown Renovation immediately before the runner accesses it?
Netrunner,3c0g9e,the_offbeat_beat_off,18,Fri Jul 3 18:56:35 2015 UTC,No. Agendas can only be scored on the corp's turn (outside of specific card text like Plan B).
Netrunner,3c0g9e,SeaSourceScorch,1 point,Fri Jul 3 19:00:49 2015 UTC,"Thank you for this clarification! I didn't know if the priority passed back and forth after rezzing, then after paid abilities, then after scoring, since they're presented in that order in the timing structure. I never really understood if each ""procedure"" had its own mini back-and-forth."
Netrunner,3c0g9e,tsarkees,2,Mon Jul 6 17:13:18 2015 UTC,"I never really understood if each ""procedure"" had its own mini back-and-forth.    Just to be clear: there is only one ""back and forth"". The active player chooses to do any number of things in any combination (rez, ability, score). Then after doing any number, that player passes priority to the inactive player. And so on. Anything listed on a ""window"" line is on equal footing with the others. Hope that helps more!"
Netrunner,3c0g9e,Jakodrako,8,Mon Jul 6 17:38:53 2015 UTC,"Your understanding is correct - although the runner will be able to use Clone Chip to recur Clot in that ability window, you get to use your abilities first and that includes scoring the agenda."
Netrunner,3c0g9e,lskalt,3,Fri Jul 3 17:29:57 2015 UTC,"This does in fact work. Agendas can be scored during most of the paid ability windows on the corps turn. Once you have advanced the second time, you get to activate/Rez/score any cards (that don't cost clicks), paying all costs, in any order before the runner can do anything."
Netrunner,3c0g9e,over_who,2,Fri Jul 3 17:32:52 2015 UTC,"Yes.  On page 32 of the main rulebook theres a neat little chart which details when you can do what, and scoring agendas are on there specifically as the same timing as paid ability winows."
Netrunner,3c0g9e,RestarttGaming,-14,Fri Jul 3 18:14:26 2015 UTC,"i think you can activate all the cards you want first since its your turn, so you can go up to the point where you trash the clot, but then you have to give the runner a chance to use his if he wants. So you cant start advancing a card before he has a chance to use his clone chip.  So no, you cant stop the runner from recurring Clot on that situation as far as my understanding goes"
Netrunner,3c0g9e,Gammaran,4,Fri Jul 3 17:21:48 2015 UTC,"You can't start advancing a card before he uses clot, but you can advance a card fully, then trigger cyberdex in your paid ability window, then a score before they have the chance to recur it"
Netrunner,3c0g9e,Mo0man,-14,Fri Jul 3 18:25:10 2015 UTC,"No.  ""Scoring Agendas– When the number of advancement tokens on an agenda is equal to or higher than its advancement requirement, the agenda is fully advanced and the Corporation can score it. The only times the Corporation can score an agenda is right before his turn begins, or after he completes an action""  The scoring happens in a different window than paid abilities, not as a paid ability.  So you don't have the chance to use a paid ability then score before the runner can react."
Netrunner,3c0g9e,Stonar,5,Fri Jul 3 17:30:43 2015 UTC,Look at your timing chart again. Scoring agendas happens in the same window as paid abilities.

You can sort by popularity and search by specific cards in the deck and etc.  Acoo.net is another deckbuilding website, probably the best deckbuilder, IMO, but worse for sharingdecks/searching for other peoples decks/looking up cards.  Stimhack is a forum where you get a LOT of good discussions going about strategy and whatnot.   ANCUR is a site where you can find a lot of the rules interactions and rulings, since FFG doesn't actually keep track of them all (the official rulings are scattered throughout the rulebook, faq's, and twitter, and no one source has all the official ones, so ANCUR consolodates them).

Netrunner,3bxppp,Krystman,8,Fri Jul 3 00:44:08 2015 UTC,"This is a case of cascading triggers mixed with simultaneous triggers. The key thing to remember is that all triggers must completely resolve before you finish resolving what triggered the ability. So the corp scores ABT which simultaneously triggers three abilities: ABT itself, Leela's ID ability, and gang sign. Following the rules for simultaneous triggers the active player (the corp) resolves their abilities first in the order of their choosing, then the other player does the same. If you choose to trigger gang sign first and hit an agenda on the first access Leela's ID ability triggers again.   You must resolve this trigger before resolving the second access.  You can't choose the order at this point or ""bank"" the bounce because nothing else has been triggered from this condition (the agenda being stolen) and your HQ access was triggered by a different condition (ABT being scored). This is essentially the closest thing Netrunner has to a chain or stack (not that stack) and it essentially works similarly: Last in, first out. Except that with Netrunner triggers can enter the stack simultaneously in which case players resolve the order. Plus the fact that you actually start resolving the first effect to enter the chain but you finish resolving it last... Oh and that the chain is multi-threaded so a chain is probably not the best example.  The simple way to think of it is as layers. When you trigger an ability (or multiple abilities) during the resolution of another ability you drop down a layer. You must then finish resolving all abilities on that layer before you finish resolving the abilities on the layer above. And if you trigger another ability on that layer then you have to resolve that before continuing on your current layer and so on and so forth.  Fun fact: with multiple gang signs out each access is resolved independently which could mean you access the same card twice. But HQ interface also triggers twice."
Netrunner,3bxppp,Rejusu,5,Fri Jul 3 12:37:52 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the order of Leela/Gang Sign can be chosen by the runner when corp scores an agenda. After stealing an agenda on the first HQ access, Leela's ability must be used 1x (from the steal) before the 2nd HQ card is accessed. After this, Leela's ability is used again (from the score). And no, there's no ability windows, so no rezzing (though that could've obviously been done before the score). All the ability windows are shown in the turn/run timing structures. The effects of a paid ability must be resolved fully before other paid abilities can be triggered."
Netrunner,3bxppp,RTsa,3,Fri Jul 3 00:48:54 2015 UTC,"Seems like it's the same ruling as normal HQ multiaccess with Leela.  No paid ability windows for either side mid-access (with the ""exception"" of prevention effects)."
Netrunner,3bxppp,embaci,1 point,Fri Jul 3 00:50:46 2015 UTC,"So, as I understand it, here's how triggered abilities work:   Something happened! All active cards check for triggers.  Both players put all cards with abilities in a queue.  The active player resolves each card in the queue, sequentially. The cards can be rearranged at any time before resolving their abilities.  The inactive player resolves each card in the queue, sequentially. (etc.)   So for this instance, we're good up til 3. At 3, there are two cards that fire: Leela, and Gang Sign. Leela chooses to have Gang Sign first in the queue. When she uses that, HQ interface triggers, giving her an additional access. We're still in the middle of the queue, so there's no paid abilities here.   Once Leela finds an agenda in HQ, that's a separate trigger. Leela's the only card that has a trigger there, so she's got to fire it immediately. (There's no may.) Again, we're in the middle of a queue, so there's no paid ability window--much like there's no paid ability window between accesses in runs.   TL;DR: triggered abilities in Netrunner work as a last in, first out system."

If clones were allowed to vote, it would devalue them as products from Jinteki because you can't just sell someone who has voting rights, which would cause people to switch to using androids instead. Clearly HB would be in favor of this, so it makes sense that they are supporters of clone suffrage.)"

You can't have darkness lurking in the shadows without some light to cast those shadows in the first place. And it makes sense that the Valley is squeaky clean. It's not home to secret facilities or factories. The branches there are prominent in the eyes of the public and so a clean image is what they present.

Netrunner,3bsqlj,Azeltir,54,Thu Jul 2 00:28:54 2015 UTC,"Ramujan might be an allusion to Srinivasa Ramanujan who was a celebrated Indian mathematician. What is more interesting about that name is the Reliant bit, which might be an allusion to Reliance which is a telecom company (part of a larger cartel) that has been less than savory in their dealings these past few years (read up on Net Neutrality in India and Zero-Rating services, shakes fist).  Panchatantra is sort of like Indian Aesop's Fables. They have short stories with talking animals that are meant to teach moral lessons by the end of the them. I loved the Panchatantra as a kid, so I'm glad they are getting a reference in Netrunner :) The Jakata Tales are another form of this, which I believe have a more Buddhist leaning to them (please fact-check me on this).  Sadyojata is one of the many forms/actions of Lord Shiva, one of the trinity (Brahma, Vishnu, Shiva) in the Hindu Pantheon. Sadyojata is associated with Creation and the element of Earth. Look out for Vamadeva, Aghora, Tatpurusa, Isana as cards maybe. Those are the other forms in that cycle."

Netrunner,3bsqlj,invictus_potato,7,Thu Jul 2 13:41:58 2015 UTC,I think the Deva mechanic fits super well because any given god or goddess (especially the trinity) have multiple forms and there's a lot of stories about them going between forms (the most famous is that of Vishnu who reincarnates into his different Avatars). I would be curious to see what the other Devas in the cycle are (assuming there is one per faction).

Netrunner,3bsqlj,dinte,27,Thu Jul 2 20:16:27 2015 UTC,"Mumbad City Grid is probably Mumbai (which is in the state of Maharastra) and Ahmedabad (which is in the state of Gujarat), which means that the sprawl is HUGE! Mumbai is sort of like the New York of India, it's a huge financial center and is the home to our beloved Bollywood. When you're not stuck in a Traffic Jam, Mumbai has sort of ""you can do anything here"" sort of vibe. It's also the city that a lot of people from the villages aspire to go to as they see it as a change to reinvent themselves. Ahmedabad is sort of like ... I dunno what an equivalent would be. It's one India's rising cities and is home to India's cotton industry which is still one of our biggest exports. Ahmedabad is nearby the place that Gandhi grew up, so it has that historical influence on it. It's interesting to contrast Mumbai and Ahmedabad because it is sort of juxtaposition between the new and the old, a struggle India has always had.  Chatterjee University seems to be a creation of FFG's, but is reflective of India's crazy relationship with universities (ask any Indian about the IIT craze, also are MBA grooms still a thing?). Chatterjee is a common Bengali last name, so it could refer to any number of famous people from my home state (West Bengal, for those of you keeping score at home). I'm going to guess it's referring to Sourav Chatterjee who is a mathematician. The mechanics are highly reflective of the software field which India is growing rapidly.

I'm sort of judging it on how big SanSan is (according to the maps they gave). Even Mumbai to Ahmedabad sounds pretty crazy given that it is two states over. It also has to do with the granularity of the Data Packs. Kala Ghoda is just a single neighborhood of Mumbai. I'm guessing this is of a similar scale to the packs of the SanSan  Cycle (The Valley, Breaker Bay, Chrome City, The Underway, Old Hollywood) which are each these big neighborhoods within a single sprawling city-like space."

Certain card art evokes this better than others. I like the Kate art on Modded, for example, or the alt art for Chaos Theory. Noise is another great example, with his name ""Ji Reilly"". Megacities have definitely brought more people close and closer together.

The difference between 4 and 5 cost agendas isn't as big. You have to spend another click and another credit scoring it and you have to double advance it when you install it, which means you can't start advancing on the turn you play another card. But none of those things matter that much.  A blank neutral 4/3 would be perfectly fair."

They probably dropped the limitation on rezzing the card for ice like Woodcutter, but it also means this can be used with advanceable assets that you want to rez and trash when the runner runs on them, like Thomas Haas, Expose or Allele Repression.   It's also somewhat useful with Reversed Accounts or GRNDL Refinery to pump them up further then fire on the same turn.

On the corp side, it's going to be easier to accidentally make an invalid deck by doing something like swapping out an econ card for an ice without noticing that you're now 2 influence over your limit. But the thing about the influence system (and agenda point requirements) is that it's always on the honor system regardless because you don't get to inspect your opponent's deck. It's just that now players need to watch out for a few more things when putting decks together if they use Alliance assets.  The runner side's theme bugs me more than the Alliance assets, actually.

Netrunner,3bsqlj,X-factor103,4,Thu Jul 2 10:06:01 2015 UTC,"I was so excited for the SanSan cycle. I feel they really nailed the flavor and theme of grounding this game with a real sense of place for the packs. I didn't really think it could get much better.  But trash my rig and call me John Masanori! If they keep up with the level of theme/flavor in the Mumbad cycle...  Just insert the ""shut up and take my money"" meme right here. In a game where it's all too easy to pick cards for abilities and synergy, stopping occassionally to oogle at pretty artwork, it's really great that they keep an emphasis on grounding the game in solid theme as well."
Netrunner,3bsqlj,X-factor103,3,Thu Jul 2 14:50:13 2015 UTC,"also: the amount of references they throw on these cards continues to blow me away! From the RR550 being the machine on the Inside Job art, to PAD factory saving you a credit, to Improved Protein Source being BUGS (which yes, a larger percentage of the world eats than you'd think if you live in a western country).

Netrunner,3bsqlj,diegofsv,3,Thu Jul 2 15:27:20 2015 UTC,"This alliance type got me thinking, can Weyland and Jinteki be allies against de suffrage, while NBN and HB are in favour of it? Could we see Weyland/Jinteki or NBN/HB cards that are influence free between factions? Like a Weyland alliance card thats free for HB and so on..That would be so awesome..."
Netrunner,3bsqlj,rumirumirumirumi,5,Wed Jul 1 22:40:31 2015 UTC,Alliance seems to be referring not to an alliance between the factions but an alliance between a local firm and the multiplanetary megacorps. The megacorps need to either use influence to get access to these locals or follow local regulations. It's an interesting play on the way location is used mechanically that I think is pretty neat.
Netrunner,3bsqlj,myth_builder,5,Thu Jul 2 00:44:28 2015 UTC,"An interesting thing might be that it is telegraphing to the Runner what the contents of the Corp's deck might be like, allowing them to respond in kind.

Netrunner,3bsqlj,diegofsv,4,Wed Jul 1 23:09:49 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but this time, things seems more aligned. You see, HB is going for a full advertising campaing in favor of the suffrage. It will probably generate a lot of media buzz which favors NBN. Jinteki on the other hand is going for political blackmail, something weyland is very good at. And for weyland, the monopoly of the ""slave market"" in HB hands is probably a bad thing. I can only imagine how the runners will do in this shadow corporate war going on."

Netrunner,3bsqlj,BountyHunterSAx,6,Wed Jul 1 21:21:15 2015 UTC,I am really REALLY hoping that the 4:3 agenda is stupidly punishing AND limit one per deck. Because anything that lets you score 3 points that easily shouldn't be in the game. And shouldn't be given to the Jinteki. And . . .  Sorry. i just hate RP so much :(.
Netrunner,3bsqlj,clarionx,7,Wed Jul 1 23:39:56 2015 UTC,"I don't think RP would play it! They want 3 Nisei and 3 Future Perfect. Replacing 3 NAPD with 2 of the 4/3 Agenda, even presuming it was a blank 4/3, doesn't help them much, because RP often relies on that 4 credit tax to protect NAPD in hand and when they're trying to score it.  I think Tenin's the one to be afraid of, here. That unadvanced card in their scoring server could be 3 points if you don't run this turn... or an Edge of the World if you do.  Though my guess is it's going to be a reverse medical breakthrough. Advancement requirement +1 for each time it's scored/stolen."
Netrunner,3bsqlj,ChainnChomp,2,Thu Jul 2 00:14:36 2015 UTC,"I can see this, though it would be limited to increasing when stolen because upping the advancement requirement when scored and having no other effect means that there is no reason to run more than one in a deck aside from drawing the first quicker (which makes the other one/two huge liabilities)."
Netrunner,3bsqlj,Mushroommm,3,Thu Jul 2 01:19:41 2015 UTC,"How about ""both players require an additional agenda point to win the game.""  It would be almost as good as a 4/2 that gave the runner a negative point: it's still 3 AP when stolen. Jinteki already has  a precedent for changing the points required to win."

I wouldn't play nearly as much Netrunner if I didn't have your site to do it with.   I do have a question, I play on a PS4 through their browser and while the game plays fine, there is no drag and drop functionality with the game. Also, while the PS4 system allows the use of a mouse, they are not compatible with the browser. I've altered my decks accordingly or asked other players for help to work around the problem but would there ever be a way to fix this? I think the same problem happens for people using tablets to play and I assume it would be a similar fix for both. Once again thanks for all you do on the site."

Netrunner,3bsu4n,marimbist11,2,Thu Jul 2 16:40:08 2015 UTC,That would be very helpful :).
Netrunner,3bsu4n,Altoecko,4,Fri Jul 3 15:26:03 2015 UTC,"Cool!  I really appreciate the interest.    Let me preface by saying that I love most aspects of Jinteki.net.  Most of the layout is fantastic, and the support for cards is great.    There are, however, some parts of the design that could use some improvement. My central goal in these recommendations is to remove the dissonance between what the user expects to happen and what happens when the user takes actions.    The largest issue is that the game is partially automated.  I prefer this design approach, but most the actions I take using the interface require trial and error, often in the middle of a nuanced game which doesn't allow for experimentation and errors.   So, I recommend a design which facilitates:    Ability to preview actions before taking them  Ability to reverse most actions before taking them  Ability to see what is and is not automated to facilitate player confidence and learning (the interface and cards)  Removing or making optional UI design choices that focus on mouse hover, double click, and dragging.   So here's my mock up. I'll try to type out most of the written comments as I'm pretty messy in my writing.  Link to mockup album  First page.  Basically, just draw quarter circles of translucent color in the four corners of every card.  Always orient menu color the same, even cross table  If possible only render color while mouse pointer is hovering.  Alternately, have a on/off button for tablet etc.  Blue Quarter:  Open menu for hosting/targeting from other cards.  Menu Options:    Target this card with an ability  host a card on this card (optional, context dependent)  (optional on interface implementation) Target a card hosted on this card.   This would raise the menu/touch region to only the hosted child card, and bring that card to the front of the interface.  Yellow Quarter (Orange?):  Open menu for changing board state/knowledge based on this card    Expose/Unexpose this card  highlight card for chat  Link card in chat(highlighting might just be better?)   Page 2  ""Purple"" Quarter:  Open menu to use this card's abilities/ pay costs    Use abilities as printed on card (this would be several options in all)  Trash/remove/forfeit as a cost  Trash card as part of an install (context dept.)   Green Quarter:  Show current tracked state of card by automated effects.  Should include running totals as well.  Examples of things that this should show:   'Power counters: 1'  Only display count if card usually uses this in context (like money stored on Kati), or if the count isn't 0 or None. 'Femme Targeted'  'Parasite lowers strength by 2'  'Temporarily lowered strength by 1 from [Datasucker] (inactive)'  This would track effects even if they're not active.  When this is cleared would be a design choice.  '""Running total strength: 3'""  This count would ignore temporary effects in its count  'Install cost lowered by 1 (inactive)' Go away at the end of the turn? Start of next click? ""Memory cost: 0"" or whatever   This facilitates players knowing what is active and what is being automated for them.  Page 3  For card interactions, showing a linked card will resolve problems with click and drag actions and using a menu will resolve double click actions.  This also provides clarity to card interactions for both players. The design constraint on this is that it needs to be fast.  I would recommend not updating the game-state until actions are taken, and having the necessary client side ability to make this really fast.   A series of pictograms of depicting how a user would link a Corroder in their grip to the Modded in their grip and Install it discounting the install cost.  Finally showing in pictograph (6) that the info Quarter would show that an effect was previously used to lower the install cost.  at (6)  For some users (and some card interactions) , linking cards backwards may make more sense.  It might make more sense for a user to select Modded first, rather than Corroder first.  I would prefer that the steps order could be changed while still converging on (6), and finally (7)  As a side note, how the menu is rendered, and how the arrow is drawn would be implementation, and perhaps context dependent, change what doesn't work.    For pictogram (7)  both players should see the the relationship that was made between the cards (updating the game-state after the active player makes their confirmation.)  This should last until another action is taken and the screen requires clarity.    I would prefer that most menu options be dropped in (2) - (6) from most cards, and that instead, only certain menus be drawn to guide the user as to which action is acceptable to move to next. The 'Cancel' menu item is important to allow for player experimentation when attempting to learn how to use the interface.  For multiple targets, or cascading events, it may be possible to draw multiple relationships in this way.    Page 4  This is a more minimal pictogram of forfeiting an agenda to rez Archer.  Similar to above, during a run the Corp Player uses the ""target this card with ability"" menu to link Archer to a Breaking News in their score area. The Player selects the Paid Ability of Breaking News (forfeit the card) to satisfy the cost of using the Archer's Paid ability (4credit, forfeit an Agenda): Rez Archer."

Data Raven gives tag or they end the run, Pachinko comes up costing the corp a mere 1credit  to rez, and but costing the runner 4credit with corroder. 4credit isn't a ton of money, but considering the runner is going to be extra pressured from needing to spend credits to remove the tag it could be pretty devastating, especially given its small cost for the corp."

Hunter (vastly underrated I think), Gutenburg, Data Raven, they're all simply better in that ID. You can really tax a runner that wants to stay tag free, then hurt them with Closed Accounts, Psychographics, Bad Times and, yes, Scorched Earth.  EDIT: Here is the ID if you're interested. I think I also see where Victoria Jenkins' ability is going, you limit their ability to clear tags."

Netrunner,3bty3c,Wily-Odysseus,2,Thu Jul 2 15:24:42 2015 UTC,"Agreed that that's pretty sweet, but a lot of people deal with Data Raven just by parasiting it to death. It's ultimately the weakness of most ice combos (e.g. with Chum or Inazuma), you usually only need to destroy 1 of the 2 and you negate the whole thing."
Netrunner,3bty3c,kirklanda,1 point,Thu Jul 2 23:44:45 2015 UTC,The main reason is that my normal way of dealing with Raven is just to Parasite it down - it's the primary use for both Para and Datasucker in that matchup. Gutenberg is much more resilient to that.
Netrunner,3btcc2,grimwalker,16,Wed Jul 1 23:54:19 2015 UTC,"I know of two instances where this happened. Both seemed unintentional. Both were simply related to going over the allotted influence.   In one case it was when the Shards just came out. One player did some deckbuilding while travelling from one tournament to another. They missed the 1 influence on Hades Shard and went to 16 influence. It was spotted by the opponent during a friendly post-match deck discussion. Player had to be disqualified because they already won matches with this. In another case, the player brought a decklist to the tournament which mis-calculated the influence by a point or so. It was a manual decklist. It seemed like an honest mistake. The issue with that was that the TO only realized day after the tournament. And that player actually won. Player additionally claimed that the decklist had been actually faulty in a different way - it supposedly didn't reflect the actual deck he played. Needless to say a monumental clusterfuck for everybody involved.   Haven't heard of clearly intentional cheating yet. It would be probably self-defeating. Top tables tend to get deck-checked first. Especially in prestigious tournaments. So if it really helps you win, you are more likely to get spotted.  Finally: cameras! We already had a case where we successfully consulted the recordings to settle a deck legality dispute."
Netrunner,3btcc2,Krystman,4,Thu Jul 2 00:23:08 2015 UTC,"+1 for cameras. If you cheat on camera, someone on youtube WILL notice it. Public ridicule WILL ensue."
Netrunner,3btcc2,kjncl,8,Thu Jul 2 13:13:34 2015 UTC,"Public shaming is another argument altogether, whether we mix in the interwebs or not. Especially on the internet things can get out of hand very quickly (there have been instances of people losing jobs over comments made via social media which were followed with public shaming).  If someone gets caught ""cheating"" on camera, at least be gracious. We're all human, and unless you were there or know the guy/girl personally, you can't really say you know their intentions. It stinks when it happens, but don't make anyone miserable over it. If they're like most of the players of this game, they're probably bummed about the consequences. And if they're not, they may have a hard time finding local games after that anyway."

When I drew it, I told him I may have fucked up my deck building. We played out the game, checked the deck afterwards for influence, was running 17 inf in a Kate deck. HAD I won the game, I would have had to give it up as a loss, but since I lost the game anyway, it didn't matter.   In any case, I'll check my decks more carefully in the future"
Netrunner,3btcc2,Mo0man,3,Thu Jul 2 00:28:48 2015 UTC,"It sucks anytime someone plays with an invalid deck because it can screw up how the tournament played out if someone loses to this invalid deck and then misses the cut, etc.  However the TO should always closely check the decklist of the winner, maybe even of the players who make the cut. If their decklist is invalid, they're disqualified. As long as this simple check is done, there is little incentive to cheat in deck construction."
Netrunner,3btcc2,Berrr,2,Thu Jul 2 00:53:10 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I get all that. I was just asking if cheating has happened, or if people are worried over something which is only theoretical, not an ongoing problem.   Like ""in person voter fraud."" Not actually a thing that happens."
Netrunner,3btcc2,Glitch29,2,Thu Jul 2 01:45:02 2015 UTC,"To answer your question directly, yes it has happened. But it mostly hasn't been caught.  Every single card game has had its share of cheats. Having seen enough cheaters in enough different card games over the years, it would be wildly naive of me to think Netrunner was an exception.  The fact that the tournaments are relatively low stakes decreases the incentive to cheat. But the this is still the wild wild west of Netrunner in terms of tournament rules and enforcement, meaning it's a lot easier to get away with things.  Most of the cheats will be in things that are easy to shrug off if caught. The most common one will be miscounting clicks or credits, then not correcting it if the opponent doesn't notice either. Some people have certainly been more blatant and dropped a Sure Gamble from their deck into their hand while searching out a program with SMC.  The truth is, even if some of these things get caught, there isn't a great way to keep track of it. The best thing you can do is just be vigilant, encourage precise play, and don't let the fact that cheaters exist ruin your enjoyment of the game."
Netrunner,3btcc2,Berrr,1 point,Thu Jul 2 06:56:33 2015 UTC,"Yeah, sorry, I hadn't addressed your question properly.  I have no exciting details to share, but I know that in my store tournaments there have been misplaced agendas resulting in invalid decks, only discovered after the round. I'm pretty sure there has been the odd deck over influence too.  Actually, I remember one time in early 2013 someone playing me in a very small tournament put Astroscript Pilot Program in their Jinteki deck. I let them play on with it as a blank 3/2 I think (!)."
Netrunner,3btcc2,RS14-2,0,Thu Jul 2 13:11:11 2015 UTC,"However the TO should always closely check the decklist of the winner, maybe even of the players who make the cut. If their decklist is invalid, they're disqualified.   What's with Netrunner judges and the super harsh penalties?  DQing somebody will ruin their day. And for what? A stupid mistake? These will always happen. Reserve DQs for serious issues: like cheating, violence, or harassment. We're not looking for an excuse to DQ people.  It's crazy that I can go to a Magic tournament with tens of thousands of dollars in prizes and receive a game loss for a mistake that would get me booted out of a Netrunner tournament which has as its prize a playmat and some deckboxes."
Netrunner,3btcc2,PJNifty,6,Thu Jul 2 05:13:42 2015 UTC,"There is some difficulty in that there is no floor rule precedent, therefore I understand TOs being harder than they might otherwise be. To give lighter penalties may be seen as favoritism or soft.  An incorrect decklist that, after review, is shown to have been an error rather than cheating should likely be at most a Game Loss. Of course, a deck that is illegal (i.e. running too much influence, or too many copies of a card) should be at minimum a game loss.  But then we have an issue. How do we determine, fairly, what cards were the 'illegal' cards in situations of too much influence. Even if obvious then what do they get replaced with? In MtG, basic lands are an easy solution for illegal cards; they are ubiquous. There exists no comparable card in ANR.  And due to the nature of match points in ANR, a game loss is a much greater penalty than the same in MTG. You can get a GL in MTG and still win a match, not so with ANR.  Anyway, I agree that DQ should be reserved for cheating or making an unsafe playing space. Until comprehensive floor rules are implemented I understand TOs attempting to preserve the sanctity of the rules with an overzealous hammer."
Netrunner,3btcc2,Berrr,2,Thu Jul 2 06:57:36 2015 UTC,"I'm honestly taken aback. I thought invalid/cheating deck construction that has already won games is about the worst rules infraction there can be. (within the bounds of gameplay I guess.)   I'm not a fan of being overly strict either. What about this: if a deck was discovered to be invalid early in the tournament, maybe all games using it so far are changed to losses, then they fix the deck and play on?  How does it work in Magic? And how would you prefer to handle it in Netrunner?  edit: I was saying before that the DQ would be if the bad deck construction was discovered after the swiss rounds are finished, or even the final elimination rounds. I can't see any other choices that late in the day. Before first round or just after? For sure, just a game loss if any played with the deck, fix the deck, and play on."
Netrunner,3btcc2,RS14-2,2,Thu Jul 2 05:23:08 2015 UTC,"I thought invalid/cheating deck construction that has already won games is about the worst rules infraction there can be. (within the bounds of gameplay I guess.)    Lots of people seem to think that the point of judging is to coerce the game or tournament state into what the judge thinks most closely resembles what would have happened had the game or games been played without error. I think these people tend to be overly eager to hand out game losses or DQs. When they encounter anything they can't roll back and fix, they just throw up their hands and go all scorched earth on the offending player.  The problem is that it's not really practical to ""correct"" the majority of errors in a fair and objective way.  And in the end, we're there to ensure that games are fair and that people have a good time. If we throw up our hands and issue harsh penalties whenever we can't ""correct"" the game, we ruin the experience for both the person who receives the game loss and their opponent (who only gets a hollow victory), and we risk determining the winner of a tournament to be simply he-who-fucks-up-last, which isn't satisfying for anyone who came wanting to actually play Netrunner.  So we accept that mistakes will happen, and that someone will probably benefit. To deter players from trying to cheat, and claiming it was an honest mistake when caught, we can start upgrading penalties to game losses after a couple warnings. Most of the time, this will probably be a sufficient deterrent (especially in a low-stakes environment like a Netrunner tournament), but is not so harsh that it ruins the experience for people who make honest mistakes (and everyone makes mistakes).   In Magic, a deck or decklist problem is punished by a single game loss. It doesn't matter where in the tournament we are, or how many games have already been played. Even at professional level rule enforcement. This is harsher than the penalty for most mistakes, and it is harsh because opponents cannot generally catch this error, and because players have plenty of time to carefully check their decks before the tournament. Combined with random (and not-so-random) deck checks, this should be enough to deter players from trying to gain advantage by playing illegal decks."
Netrunner,3btcc2,Berrr,2,Thu Jul 2 06:15:12 2015 UTC,"Huh. Well, TIL that my generally laid back local Netrunner community has a harsher punishment than MTG.  I guess a deckbuilding mistake seems so inconceivable to me because I always design my decks in an online deckbuilder.  I'm thinking about this single game loss punishment, I guess it works because that should be enough to cost the player significant placing in a tournament. And even in the extreme case that it was discovered after the final match, it would cost them the tournament. I assume they must then make their deck legal before playing any further games?"
Netrunner,3btcc2,RS14-2,2,Thu Jul 2 06:28:12 2015 UTC,"I guess a deckbuilding mistake seems so inconceivable to me because I always design my decks in an online deckbuilder.

I assume they must then make their deck legal before playing any further games?   Yeah, if you look at the bottom of the page I linked, under ""Additional Remedy,"" you'll see instructions on how to do this.

Especially on a style of TO problem resolution to support this."
Netrunner,3btcc2,m50d,1 point,Thu Jul 2 07:13:15 2015 UTC,"Honestly it is not hard to get the deckbuilding right, and you have plenty of time to check your own deck. The one mistake that's easy to make is forgetting to put your agendas back in, but that gives you a massive, game-winning advantage and needs to be heavily penalised.  I would turn it around: mistakes will happen, and when they do the penalties are automatic and, in winning terms, severe. So it's normal for people to have game losses and the occasional DQ every so often. That's ok, and doesn't have to ruin anyone's day. If you're DQed that just means you can't win that day, which absolutely should be the case (frankly I'd feel terrible taking a prize if I'd played with an illegal deck, even for just one round). You play the bottom-ranked player each round and they get an automatic win (like the bye when you have an odd number of players). You still get your 6 games, you can still have a fun day. You just can't win the tournament."
Netrunner,3btcc2,Berrr,1 point,Thu Jul 2 12:11:05 2015 UTC,"I like this concept of being DQed for a serious but (seemingly) accidental rule violation, but being able to play on in this way."
Netrunner,3btcc2,Rejusu,2,Thu Jul 2 13:07:13 2015 UTC,"Honestly I doubt Magic would be much different if you took away the judge program. The issue in Netrunner is a lack of structure. There's no little book that tells judges and TO's ""If X do Y"" and so they often just take the easy way out and wipe the slate clean. A judge program and a proper set of rules on how to handle mistakes and suspected cheating would go a long way towards fixing this problem."

Netrunner,3btcc2,m50d,0,Thu Jul 2 11:42:43 2015 UTC,"The absolute worst thing would be to give cheaters an advantage. And frankly whether it's deliberate is beside the point - I don't want people who are careless with their decks to have an advantage over people who check them, and nor do I want it to be about who can give a convincing excuse. The harsh penalties are necessary to avoid silliness from the Sirlin-reading ""cheating is part of the game"" crowd.   Fairness is also vital. The netrunner ""floor rules"" are simple and easy for even a novice TO to apply consistently: any rule violation during play is a game loss and any illegal deck is a DQ.  Fundamentally a DQ isn't such a big issue precisely because the community is friendly and the stakes are small. If I'm DQed for an illegal deck and I still get to play 6 friendly games that day, do I really care that I'm out of the running for the deckbox?"

Netrunner,3btcc2,RestarttGaming,2,Thu Jul 2 22:31:14 2015 UTC,"As Netrunner grows as a competitive game, this should just be handled like it is in other competitive deckbuilding games.  In local and casual level events, you are trusted to bring a legal deck.  You'll only be called on it if an opponent says something and a judge has to verify.  At competitive events that draw more than the hometown crowd, decklists will be required, but they mostly won't be checked unless there's a suspected problem, maybe a random deckcheck or two.  At larger events decklists will be required and there will be random deckchecks between rounds.  In addition, at super high level events the final topx brackect should be subject to deckchecks.  The sad truth is , in any game with hidden information, from go fish to Netrunner, it will be possible to cheat.  Thankfully there isn't a lot if that in Netrunner yet due to its relative newness and low profitability of tournament play.  But as it grows, Your just going to have to trust in the rules, the tournament organizers, and other players, because there's no way to feasably check all decks at big events.  Just trust they'll be caught sooner or later and weeded out."

I have witnessed a lot of little-stuff cheating. Not quite paying the full amount for something, not quite getting the order of events correct, etc. It's the kind of stuff that's probably totally on accident and had a very minor effect on the game, but it happens all of the time. If it is on purpose, it's really easy to play off as an accident and it actually makes the person who pointed it out seem like the jerk."

No penalty was given to the player , since he announced it himself.  Installing two agenda's in the same server.  I think the term is double loading in the French meta.

If he's doing this intentionally, as in he knows his next opponent and seeks out the previous round's opponent to ask him about what he's seen in that specific deck, that's blatantly Outside Assistance, and he gets a Game Loss for sure, and Investigation Ensues to determine if he's Cheating as he's breaking the rule intentionally.    This was done in a Top8 and he was certain that his opponent was going to be that player.  Nobody actually answered his question but nobody called him out on it.  It was a very awkward moment.  Nobody was actually prepared for a question like this.  Nobody answered him as well.     Straightforward Outside Assistance. The player that announced this fact gets a Game Loss. If he was a Spectator, he'd be enrolled in the tournament, given a Game Loss, and asked to leave the venue. His friends might also get Game Losses if this was intentional on their part, as in they were trying to determine who did and did not have H&P, otherwise no penalty. (We don't penalize players for what other people say.)   I never challenged it (hell , i didn't have the rules knowledge i have today) and learned to shut my face about this kind of things.  Or announce that i don't have it when i'm certain its in my deck. I'm having great succes with this Blue Sun that doesn't play scorched earth.  (The Midseasons are just there to kill your Kati)"
Netrunner,3btcc2,Rejusu,1 point,Thu Jul 2 15:57:14 2015 UTC,"Truthfully, you have to kind of just take it on good faith. It might mean needing a sub-TO to check decklists as a QA measure, but the fact of the matter is that there are quite a few, barely enforceable ways for people to intentionally cheat. One such way is to install an agenda as if it were ICE and simply never rez it. We're lucky enough to not really have to deal with that very often in Netrunner, there's no money in it so its sort of like cheating at sport fishing--the only reason is to do it for you and do it legit, if you're gonna cheat you may as well go where the cash is :/"
Netrunner,3btcc2,kjncl,1 point,Thu Jul 2 00:58:29 2015 UTC,If someone is installing agendas as ICE they better hope they never play against a Snitch Au Revoir deck.
Netrunner,3btcc2,thefalseidol,5,Thu Jul 2 11:07:09 2015 UTC,"I don't think there are any rules on it, but at the end of a game where I play as corp, win or lose, I turn up all my installed, un-rezzed cards. I find it to be a gesture of good sportsmanship, especially if I won and the runner wiffed on a couple of makers eyes."
Netrunner,3btcc2,firefrenchy,1 point,Thu Jul 2 13:10:54 2015 UTC,"Haha, good point, I just meant that there are a few ways netrunner falls apart if you have to check for intentional cheating"
Netrunner,3btcc2,BinarySecond,1 point,Thu Jul 2 15:56:34 2015 UTC,"If you intentionally cheat at a gnk you would have to be quite the lowlife. And there are mandatory decklists for anything higher. I suggest that deck checks become mandatory before top 4/8/16, but other than that hopefully people just build correct decks. You should always be keeping an eye on what your opponent is spending influence on anyway, so you should be able to tell if they are likely over. Possibly the same with these new deck building restrictions"
Netrunner,3btcc2,Rejusu,1 point,Thu Jul 2 01:23:16 2015 UTC,Has there been cheating? Of course. It's very hard to detect however.    I've never caught someone intentionally with an illegal deck but a few with accidents.
Netrunner,3btcc2,Imrahill,1 point,Thu Jul 2 08:55:41 2015 UTC,I don't know of any intentional examples but mistakes are always going to be made. I heard of one player who played an illegal deck in a tournament because someone had (literally) stolen two of their agendas a couple of days before and they never noticed their deck was short. The lesson is check your deck before every tournament! It never hurts to be careful.  As for influence I typically use an app to actually brew the deck before I physically construct it. Means my agenda points and influence should always be correct.  Also I don't see how this is more of an issue for TO's. If you're checking someone's deck you check all of it against their list. And if you're not... Well it's not like this creates any more opportunity to cheat than there was previously.
Netrunner,3btcc2,Imrahill,1 point,Thu Jul 2 09:28:24 2015 UTC,"One of the reasons TO's need official floor rules from ffg. In a high level tournament before I've had a game loss for a decklist and actually deck (accidently) differing by 1 card, but both were legal. Seems about right. But if the deck is illegal it is much harder. As for finding this out at top tournaments top tables should be deck checked throughout the day. So at least everyone in the cut has had there deck checked. In a store champs we had a player on 16 inf due to a shard but was on bottom table so TO just turned card round to make it blank and I think a game loss. DQ's are no fun but if ffg give a set of rulings at least the decision is made in advance and doesn't make the TO feel like a dick..."
Netrunner,3btcc2,RS14-2,1 point,Thu Jul 2 15:56:25 2015 UTC,As for deliberately cheating once we have a set of floor rules for TO's it shouldn't make much difference if it was deliberate or accidental. Though I know magic does take intent into account some - like lesser effect if you call TO on yourself as opposed to your opponent. So we may see something like this.

Netrunner,3btcc2,X-factor103,0,Thu Jul 2 16:37:58 2015 UTC,"A TO isn't and shouldn't have to be a judge of character, and to introduce subjective judgement is to invite bias. There are rules and there are penalties for breaking those rules; that way it's simple and easy to enforce."
Netrunner,3btcc2,SiggNaturStyle,1 point,Thu Jul 2 17:35:06 2015 UTC,"Maybe we should also be asking: as it's the TO's job to make sure everything's kosher, what can we be doing to make the TO's job easier?  Obviously, people should check their lists the night before, and check the physical cards to make sure everything matches the decklist. But ultimately it's the TO's job to ensure the tournament is run properly. Maybe apps to manage tournament ladders could be upgraded to ""fix"" strength of schedule and/or rankings for future matches. This would give the TO more leeway to fix things if someone was pulled, even late in a tournament.  I'm also in agreement that penalties need to be perhaps more matching to the greivance. I've not played many tournaments so take it with a grain of salt. I like the idea that if a deck is fixable between matches (say 1 card too many that is causing over-influence), you could cut that card to match your decklist and receive a loss just for that round. But you could keep playing. More serious infractions could result in DQs."
Netrunner,3br7yd,Willingdone,6,Wed Jul 1 14:29:08 2015 UTC,"Good job man :D I really like your videos, I just started playing netrunner and this ""retrospective"" gives me a lot of info about the Core set :)"

Netrunner,3br7yd,Vysetron,4,Wed Jul 1 18:44:19 2015 UTC,"Ichi 1.0 is still one of the best pieces of ICE for providing that early/midgame gutpunch. I think it's only gotten better, at least by comparison to other sentries. It's basically Rototurret but good, which is really sad given that they were in the same set.  Edit: forgot to mention that I have a love affair with NEXT Design and if it had 17 influence I don't think I'd play any other HB ID."
Netrunner,3br7yd,Razalhague,4,Wed Jul 1 19:25:51 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I didn't mean to imply that Ichi 1.0 isn't good, just that it would be even better if not for Datasucker + Mimic.  Even against that setup, it's still a three credit tax. Ichi rules, don't get me wrong. I just think it should've been even more devastating.  I too love NEXT Design, but I've never had a build that I felt was on par with Engineering the Future."
Netrunner,3br7yd,randymagnum1669,3,Wed Jul 1 19:45:49 2015 UTC,"While I agree with most of your evaluations, as an avid HB player I can't help but feel that some of your evaluations are a bit off. Maybe it's a matter of meta and decks, but here's where I disagree with you:   Archived Memories is a perfectly playable card. Particularly so if you have important but cheap-to-trash cards in your deck, like Caprice Nisei. It beats Interns by being able to recur operations (mostly Biotic) and being usable for bluffing (the Adonis/ABT switcheroo). As for Reclamation Order, it is pretty rare for you to be able and willing to recur 3 or even 2 copies of some card. The extra click really makes it much less useful than Archived Memories. I would honestly rate Viktor 1.0 over Ichi 1.0. I simply see more Mimic+Datasucker combos, Sharpshooters, Atmans @ 4 and Switchblades than I do Yogs. Most popular runners have 1 link, so the third sub on Ichi could just as well not even be there. This means that quite often Viktor taxes the runner either the same amount or more than Ichi. While Ichi can win you games almost on its own, it happens so rarely that most of the time the two extra credits just aren't worth it. Viktor was especially good during the Lunar cycle when your opponent was pretty likely a Criminal with Passport or ZU.13, making it as taxing as Eli. Yes, they could definitely have given Experiential Data better stats to make it playable, but I think 0/5 would be too far. Also, I would recommend you actually try the card, it can be fun in casual play since no one remembers it exists."
Netrunner,3br7yd,RS14-2,3,Wed Jul 1 20:20:53 2015 UTC,"Love these videos man. Most videos are pretty boring, full of color commentary that is very ""in-joke"" between the commentators, or you cant even hear the people speaking. Keep it up! Looking forward to the 20 minute video on Criminal ;)"
Netrunner,3bqtjp,Berrr,12,Wed Jul 1 12:11:28 2015 UTC,"The public initiative cards are about forcing the runner to run. Hey this isn't a trap, see, and I'll keep gaining an advantage until you stop me. Come steal it.  Underway Renovation (possibly backed up by Blacklist/Chronos Project/Student Loans) says to the runner, ""you have to come steal me soon"". Once they run and steal it, it activates the successful run condition for SEA Source. And they spent like 6-10 credits to get in there and only gained 1 agenda point for doing so. Another damned-if-you-do-damned-if you-don't scenario.  Having said all that, I think the card will be too slow to pressure the runner into running. I suppose you could advance it 3-6 times and if they aren't going for it, either score it out or let it sit around while you credit back up."
Netrunner,3bqtjp,JimTor,3,Wed Jul 1 13:06:32 2015 UTC,"Yeah I like this thinking.   They're an interesting comparison, Oaktown Renovation can continue to be advanced while also maintaining an economic lead with it, holding that scorched kill threat in play.  However Oaktown Renovation doesn't actually hurt the runner directly, other than building up this econ lead. By contrast Underway Renovation will start properly hurting them after a couple of continuous turns of advancing, potentially forcing a run quicker?"
Netrunner,3bqtjp,satellite_uplink,1 point,Wed Jul 1 13:23:10 2015 UTC,"Well they're very different cards.   Oaktown is an economic benefit, which is something that has already been demonstrated is desirable in almost any deck... but there's competition for those slots from strong existing cards (Geothermal, NAPD).  Underway is a new ability that doesn't directly interact with many existing strategies or decks.  Is it strong enough to create a new decktype or does it just sit on the shelf aside from a few kitchen table games?  I think probably the latter, unfortunately, but if you want a card like Underway then it's not really competing with anything else for the spot."
Netrunner,3bqtjp,JimTor,5,Wed Jul 1 13:30:05 2015 UTC,"Maybe works in Argus? Runners will be drawing aggressively to pay the meat damage tax. This is a perfect 1 point agenda for the deck, as it pressures their stack size, and triggers the ID ability when they do come steal it. Argus just might not have enough money to over-advance this agenda heavily."
Netrunner,3bqtjp,disguise117,2,Wed Jul 1 13:37:18 2015 UTC,"Argus is about overwhelming the runner with different threats.  I think this card would work in an Argus Midseasons/SEA Scorch deck since it does force runners into running instead of just sitting back and building up credits.  This is especially important for Crim or runners who don't pack good recursion.  Maxx or Kate are unlikely to care if you mill a couple more cards, but Leela and Andy are going to be worried if you mill their last fracter."
Netrunner,3bqtjp,HeroOfTheSong,2,Wed Jul 1 23:18:49 2015 UTC,Actually think maxx in particular is in an interesting place with her recurrsion. For the most she walks a tight rope with her recursion because of all of her self mill making additional milling potentially powerful. I think the real Anarch that gets around this are the number that play triple clone chip.
Netrunner,3bqtjp,satellite_uplink,7,Thu Jul 2 01:14:18 2015 UTC,"I'm coming around to actually quite liking Oaktown Renovation.    It's got a better payback than the first Geothermal Fracking counter without any bad pub, and usually pushing an agenda puts you through a brief period of weaker economy just as you want to be able to rez everything to protect the Agenda, which Oaktown actually helps with (so good for Ash/Caprice/Midseasons etc).  I can see why you would play it, especially with Midseasons.  You're waving a red flag that there's an agenda to steal while gaining cash to Midseasons them if they steal it, and if they decide to not steal then you just carry on merrily advancing it for 2credit per click and make your eventual Midseasons even better."
Netrunner,3bqtjp,JimTor,13,Wed Jul 1 13:23:23 2015 UTC,"Oaktown in unreal, as long as your deck is ok with 2-pointers."
Netrunner,3bqtjp,Glitch29,3,Wed Jul 1 13:33:40 2015 UTC,"This.  The card is so good you don't need a nuanced understanding to know whether it goes in your particular deck.  If you're not running a 6/3/3/3/3/2 agenda suite or some bizarre Weyland Mushin build, you should be sleeving up Oaktown.  It's the green Astroscript Pilot Program."
Netrunner,3bqtjp,llama66613,4,Wed Jul 1 17:07:34 2015 UTC,"The green Astroscript Pilot Program is Project Atlas. Oaktown is more like the green Nisei MKII, but the analogy doesn't exactly hold."

Netrunner,3bqtjp,disguise117,3,Wed Jul 1 22:13:07 2015 UTC,"As far as the Fracking vs Oaktown goes, imma do some math real quick.  I'll ignore the ""cost"" of installing each agenda, since it's irrelevant given that you're doing the same action in either case.  Every time you advance an agenda, you effectively lose 2 credits: the credit you spent and the credit that you could have gotten by simply clicking for it.  Oaktown fixes this by giving you both credits back when you advance it, which is awesome.  So, Geothermal:  4 clicks to advance = -8 credits 2 clicks to pull off advancement tokens = -2 credits + 14 credits   That leaves Geothermal Fracking at a 4 credit gain vs clicking for credits.  Now Oaktown:  4 clicks to advance = -8 credits +8 credits   We've already broken even, which is great, and if we decide to overadvance the agenda for the 2 clicks that we would have spent pulling off the 2 Geothermal counters, we end up with  2 clicks to advance = -4 credits + 6 credits   This leaves us 2 credits behind where Geothermal would have left us vs simply clicking for credits, but we don't take 2 Bad Publicity, which is a pretty damn huge deal.  Oaktown is just a bonkers good agenda."
Netrunner,3bqtjp,satellite_uplink,3,Wed Jul 1 20:09:21 2015 UTC,"Great analysis.  The other thing I'd point out is that Oaktown is an amazing card for tempo as well.  If you're close to broke, you usually have to spend a turn clicking for credits to protect/score the Geothermal.  With Oaktown, you can install it and start advancing it and it's the same as clicking twice for credits!  This is huge early game when you can score out an Oaktown behind an Ice Wall or Enigma and still be able to defend your centrals that turn.  It's also incredible for when you've been siphoned or vamped."
Netrunner,3bqtjp,Rejusu,1 point,Wed Jul 1 23:28:02 2015 UTC,If you overadvance it twice and leave it sitting on the table a turn longer than geothermal.  Your comparison was flawed in taking it that far and measure 6 clicks vs 6 clicks. It's reasonable to get Oaktown to 5 by IAA but suggesting you can get it to 6 or more is pushing it as you risk a 4AP swing just for a couple of extra credits.
Netrunner,3bqtjp,satellite_uplink,2,Wed Jul 1 20:39:00 2015 UTC,It works great out of Weyland too because they typically don't run advanceable traps so if they install and advance a card then it's rarely going to be anything but an agenda. Plus most agendas they will advance once after installing anyway. All Oaktown tells them is that it's not an Atlas.
Netrunner,3bqtjp,AnalysisSitus,2,Wed Jul 1 15:50:21 2015 UTC,Yeah exactly.  I'm not slam-dunking it into decks but I've convinced myself that I'm not giving a whole lot away by installing face up and there's money to be made from playing Oaktown.
Netrunner,3bqtjp,X-factor103,1 point,Wed Jul 1 15:52:44 2015 UTC,"I've convinced myself that I'm not giving a whole lot away by installing face up   I think this is really the key point. Provided you advance the same turn you install, I think you aren't giving much if anything away. Most people don't run traps in Weyland anyway, so they half know its an agenda, so the main thing you lose is them having to set aside 4 extra creds in case it's NAPD. Also, you can't pretend it's a 5/3 by IAA-ing. But really, I think these things are more than mitigated by the money you make."
Netrunner,3bqtjp,-dr00-,2,Wed Jul 1 18:19:59 2015 UTC,"I've said it before in other forums, but I'll mention it again here. This is a great point. When you run Jinteki and ask ""how do I make traps hit"", this is the same basic question. You don't do this to create mindgames. You make lose/lose situtations for the runner.  The point is to create pressure and exploit it. If you can incentivise them to run by putting a Blacklist down as well, all the better. You could get really nasty by tossing in a painful upgrade: Red Herrings, Ash, Caprise, Self-Destruct all come to mind. And yes, as others here are saying, capitalizing on the run tax you create is also key (to score or scorch, that is the question)."

Netrunner,3bqtjp,satellite_uplink,14,Wed Jul 1 20:41:58 2015 UTC,"You're using it to mass trash and hopefully hit an important part of the runner's rig that they can't recycle.  The millstone fallacy is bulletproof, but to continue the Magic analogy then in Netrunner every Runner deck is a combo deck to some extent (eg. Yog.0 + Corroder + Femme Fatale = rig) and runners usually play relatively few redundant copies of those essential cards because they're not used to having them trashed.  That's the weapon.  Land it early and trash trash trash.  Of course, Clone Chip exists.  Which is a shame.  I didn't say Renovation was good..."
Netrunner,3bqtjp,vicvonshroom,6,Wed Jul 1 13:19:28 2015 UTC,"Interesting point that every runner deck is in some capacity a combo deck. So after milling a moderate chunk of their deck you have decent odds of actually destroying part of their 'combo' (eg, ability to break code gate ice)."
Netrunner,3bqtjp,satellite_uplink,5,Wed Jul 1 13:25:29 2015 UTC,"Somebody will be able to do the maths of 'if the runner plays two of each breaker how many times to do I need to advance Renovation to have a ~80% chance of destroying both copies of at least one of their breakers?'  I think it's going to be quite a lot of advances, which is a huge investment of both clicks and credits.  And Clone Chip exists.  And Levy.  And Deja Vu."
Netrunner,3bqtjp,vicvonshroom,2,Wed Jul 1 13:33:22 2015 UTC,"Blacklist also exists, as does student loans. Having to pay 7 for a levy isn't great and again with blacklist out, this combo(Blacklist/student loans/chronos project)  could crush a runner that needs to recur."
Netrunner,3bqtjp,satellite_uplink,1 point,Wed Jul 1 13:53:13 2015 UTC,"In dreamland, perhaps.  Blacklist and Student Loans both have a trash cost and if the runner is put into a tough corner they'll trash it.  IF you had the money and time to install and protect Underway long enough to trash both Corroders AND also had time to install and protect Blacklist behind a barrier AND did all this before the runner drew Corroder anyway... then yeah, you might be able to turn that into a win."
Netrunner,3bqtjp,vicvonshroom,1 point,Wed Jul 1 13:57:54 2015 UTC,"Dream land nothing. Wasn't whizzard said to never be competitive? This is a solid combo that could work and I guarantee that someone can make it work. With batty coming soon, a heavy trash/recursion denying Corp is becoming a real possibility. These cards having trash doesn't mean much if the Corp knows how to tax them."
Netrunner,3bqtjp,satellite_uplink,2,Wed Jul 1 14:05:31 2015 UTC,"Anyone who said Whizzard would never be competitive needed their brains testing.  We rave about Kate/EtF's 1 credit per turn advantage and Whizzard clearly has a 3 credit per turn advantage in certain situations.  He will always be a card who waxes/wanes as the meta shifts, I feel.  Back to Underway Renovation - You're trying to play a strategy that has to set up early before the runner naturally draws the cards you're trying to deny them getting, but also has to have a huge lead in economy and infrastructure before you begin to implement that strategy (and have secured your centrals to avoid losing while you piss around milling cards).  That's almost the definition of a win-more plan, because if you get into that position you could play almost anything and win the game with even more certainty... just overadvance Project Atlas seven times instead!"
Netrunner,3bqtjp,Rejusu,1 point,Wed Jul 1 14:11:14 2015 UTC,We'll just have to agree to disagree here. I don't think this requires that much set up at. Two-three turns worth? Maybe if that but I could see milling as early as turn three and putting a single ash in the same server with blacklist means the runner has to spend two clicks and 6 to be able to recur once more. A heavy blow if they have to also find the proper breaker with an smc. Flat line decks don't always go for the win but you can if you wanted. A deck with these cards could do the very juggle. I look forward to seeing the bonkers decks some will make with these cards.
Netrunner,3bqtjp,PJNifty,3,Wed Jul 1 14:53:51 2015 UTC,But how much money does all this need?  I mean why haven't they stolen Underway while you're busy protecting Blacklist?  And two clicks and six credits sounds like a pretty good deal to completely invalidate the corp's plan of overadvancing Underway Renovation to cripple my ability to complete my rig.
Netrunner,3bqtjp,grimwalker,2,Wed Jul 1 15:14:49 2015 UTC,"I agree with /u/satellite_uplink, you're talking about a super specific setup that requires you to have the advantage. It's nice to think about the stuff you can do when the stars align and conditions are perfect but there are just too many factors outside of your control. You say you don't think it takes much setup? Let's examine what you need to pull this off: Blacklist (influence) Ash (influence) At least three pieces of ICE, two to protect centrals and one to protect Underway. Underway Renovation  And let's not forget that you need some econ to fuel these shenanigans. So you're already looking at more than five cards to set this up, at least two of which have to be specific cards.  Then on top of that you have to hope that you mill every possible way they could get in and steal that agenda. Breakers, backup breakers, inside jobs, parasites. And you better hope you mill all their recursion as well because six credits and two clicks to trash or not that blacklist will die. Except it likely won't cost them two clicks because you won't have the econ (because you're spending all your clicks and credits advancing a one pointer) to win the trace. Meanwhile agendas are likely building up in your hand because you're spending your turn advancing (with econ you're pulling out of thin air) instead of playing cards.  Oh and all this is rendered moot if the Runner has what they need in their opening hand.  The deck you're describing would be bonkers, but probably not for the reasons you'd like."
Netrunner,3bqtjp,satellite_uplink,1 point,Wed Jul 1 15:41:50 2015 UTC,Whizzard was said to be uncompetitive at the time because of a lackluster Anarch card pool and and the corporation relying heavily on operation economy.
Netrunner,3bqtjp,AnalysisSitus,3,Wed Jul 1 18:42:54 2015 UTC,"Plus most runner decks either run or at least import some degree of tutoring or recursion. Which makes the statement    In the case when your deck “runs out”, or requires deck searching   Apply to quite a large percentage of runner decks. And for those who rely on recursion, exhausting their methods to do so is very effective."
Netrunner,3bqtjp,jtobiasbond,4,Wed Jul 1 13:35:41 2015 UTC,"You're misunderstanding how that statement applies to the original argument.  In Netrunner few decks REQUIRE tutoring or recursion to win, they just make use of it to support their central non-tutor non-recursion strategy.  The tutoring in Netrunner would usually work against Underway Renovation, not for it, because it would give the Runner additional ways to access the few key cards you're trying to mill.  eg. you're no longer trying to hit both Corroders before they draw one, you're trying to hit both Corroders before they draw one OR one of their three Special Orders.  Where this does work... Self-Modifying Code gets worse if you're playing a load of silver bullets as your options disappear as you get milled, so that's an example of how milling can hurt a tutoring deck."
Netrunner,3bqtjp,satellite_uplink,1 point,Wed Jul 1 14:06:33 2015 UTC,"Well, take PPVP Kate. A lot of lists run 3x SMC, 3x Clone Chip as their tutoring and recursion, and find that good enough. When you mill them, what you really accomplish is turning Clone Chips into SMCs. That is, if the Runner wants a Gordian Blade and you mill that, you ""deactivate"" SMC for them, but ""activate"" Clone Chip.   So it's not obvious to me that milling a moderate chunk of cards would slow the Runner down that much. Yes, you do cause them to spend more recursion cards, but you also let them spend less time on tutoring. That could definitely be a net positive, but it doesn't seem obviously strong enough for me to want to build around."
Netrunner,3bqtjp,myth_builder,1 point,Wed Jul 1 16:07:48 2015 UTC,"Of course, you could mill Clone Chip . . ."
Netrunner,3bqtjp,steevo15,3,Wed Jul 1 17:15:33 2015 UTC,"Oh sure.  But the odds of milling 3x Clone Chip and 2x Corroder are far FAR higher than just milling 2x Corroder, so if somebody is playing Clone Chip then life gets that much harder.  Basically it's a plan, but a really shit plan."
Netrunner,3bqtjp,AnalysisSitus,7,Wed Jul 1 17:29:05 2015 UTC,"This could be pretty awesome in Argus that is also running Chronos Project and/or Blacklist. This isn't so much a mill victory (because that doesn't exist for Corps :P) as it telling the Runner, ""Hey, you have a problem that you need to fix and soon"" and bait them into making a sub-optimal run."
Netrunner,3bqtjp,disguise117,2,Wed Jul 1 13:10:12 2015 UTC,"My thinking as well. Corps can kind of get a mill victory. PE is especially good at it with 1000 cuts playstyle. If you don't have any cards left if your deck, your hand becomes your only life left. Argus could try to play a similar game"
Netrunner,3bqtjp,Paddosan,1 point,Wed Jul 1 17:21:56 2015 UTC,"The thing PE has that Argus doesn't is that against PE, stealing always costs you ""1 HP"", and you can run out of those. Against Argus, you can set aside a click and two credits, which you won't ever run out of. So while I think the idea is really cool, I'm not sure Argus attrition can work. Or at least, it's going to need some more support cards."

You're right that the runner can elect to take a tag rather than the damage.  However, if the runner is multi-accessing that becomes a dangerous proposition.  Even if they aren't, Data Ravens or False Leads make taking tags a very bad idea in general.  Add Snare!s, DRTs and the upcoming Contract Killer to a deck with Underway Renovation and you've got the potential to create some serious headaches for the runner."

You've got to protect two servers with impenetrable ICE to get such a lockout, and you've got to get very lucky to mill something good during your turn to Blacklist it out.  It'd be a bit more appealing if it went 2 -> 3 as opposed to 1 -> 2, but I'm still not sure it's ever worth its deckslots even then.  Oaktown is fantastic, though. I love the idea of these agendas, but this one is definitely not worth putting a 3/1 in your deck, even in a deck that wants Blacklist anyway."
Netrunner,3bqtjp,Quillets,3,Wed Jul 1 14:47:31 2015 UTC,"It's better as bait than anything else.  Play it when you have Midseason in hand, advance it once or twice, just scare the runner into putting resources into stealing it.  Maybe in a server that's taxing but not ridiculously so.  Just enough to get them to spend some credits and be bent over for Midseason."
Netrunner,3bqtjp,spanargoman,3,Wed Jul 1 15:01:49 2015 UTC,"On its own, I think Underway Renovation won't do much. I mean, we consider scoring a Government Takeover basically impossible, which would suggest that advancing Underway Renovation more than (say) 6 times is pretty hard. At that point, you've milled 9 cards. Absolutely something, but it doesn't sound good enough on it's own.  On the other hand, the fact that Weyland gets Underway Renovation and Student Loans seems to suggest that ""heap control"" is about to become a Weyland theme. Maybe I'm reaching here, but if Weyland actually does get some more cards which benefit from the Runner having lots of stuff in their heap, suddenly we're talking. It might also be good balance-wise, as it would probably be good against PPVP Kate."

Netrunner,3bqtjp,The11thNomad,3,Thu Jul 2 07:21:31 2015 UTC,"I'm underwhelmed by Underway Renovation, as a 3/1 it really has to bring the thunder with its ability for me to consider slotting it in over better agendas, and I don't know that it succeeds here. This is because, best case scenario, you are advancing this every turn with Root, you're still not gaining board position nor (necessarily) impacting the runner enough to slow them down. Unless they are drawing for plascrete and you want to try to mill it first, I would rather play a 4/2 and use the extra deck slot for a melange--which to me is a much more threatening use of all your clicks.   Often, the cards you're most worried about as the corporation are ones that are fetchable at instant speed, which to me means that the safest place for them to be (for you) is IN the runner's grip--milling cards just to let the runner play them with clone chip is not great. I really only see this as useful for trying to race the runner to their plascrete, and this feels like a very inefficient and unreliable way to trash it. Though I suppose if you can lock the runner into wasting their whole turn too (drawing for plascrete), they are more actively bleeding  resources by drawing 4 per turn compared to your 1 (mandatory).  It does seem like there is an emergent playstyle where Weyland recognizes the value of the heap to the runner, and hopes to enterprise on it through heavy tax and denial. The goal then isn't that you mill key cards with the hope they have no recursion, as it is to mill cards where you are now aware of them and can control how they enter play. But if that deck becomes a thing, and right now that's still a pretty big if, Underway Renovation still doesn't make the cut to me unless there is a better way to put advancements on it (you can't drop it with a Mushin I don't think, since it isn't being advanced, that would have been a neat interaction :/ )"

Get the runners deck in the Heap and restrict him from using it. Meanwhile score out ice in a light server, or making him miss one of his breakers completely and use this to score out.  Things I'm thinking about:   Back it up with the Sea-Scorch-Scorch as alternative win condition Some program trashing ICE and Powershutdown to get more of the rig in the Heap. Lots of assets to protect, maybe Gagarin will help with this? The Root to make the advancing of Underway Renovation free. A scored Utopia fragment makes the Underway Renovation a bitch to steal. Bad Pub seems to be a bad way to go, considering you have assets to protect. Chronos project seems interesting, but has anti-synergy with student loans and blacklist. Power Grid Overload to target consoles.   Anyone have any other ideas, comments? Cards that might interact well with this setup? Will it be fast enough?"

Netrunner,3bqtjp,the-_-hatman,2,Wed Jul 1 14:20:46 2015 UTC,"In terms of just milling, there are a few cards that the runner just needs to play: breakers and damage prevention. So if you hit those, you're making a huge payoff. On the other hand, you're looking at ~8 cards out of a deck of 45, 40 with most runners after the opening hand. And recursion is a thing. If you somehow end up with everything in the heap, that's a problem unless you're set up.  I guess the thing to compare this to is a DLR deck. Other than the chance to mill agendas, DLR decks put a hard timer on the corp--score out in so many turns, or I just win. This is a lot softer of a timer: get set up in so many turns, or I have free reign over the board. It forces the runner to either speed up or stop you. I'm not sure if milling 3 cards is enough punishment, but when you're hitting for 2 a pop, the threat gets significantly larger."
Netrunner,3bqtjp,PJNifty,3,Wed Jul 1 14:36:06 2015 UTC,"You're bleeding $3 a turn to do mill which isn't a corp win condition, while also spending money elsewhere to protect the board while this is happening. How much money do you intend to have when you start your timer?"
Netrunner,3bqtjp,the-_-hatman,1 point,Wed Jul 1 18:48:26 2015 UTC,"Sure, it does take quite a bit of money. But once you get up to 4, you can mill 4 in 2 clicks, leaving you 1 to do whatever.

There are too many moving parts, you are investing ice, clicks, credits into protecting a blacklist, an underway reno, which you are advancing to mill stuff that the player hopefully doesn't already have on the board, in hand, or just draws. As long as anarchs and shapers are the top runner factions this will do jack. If/When Criminals inevitably become a dominant force again, this agenda may be worth revisiting"
Netrunner,3bqtjp,david_duplex,2,Wed Jul 1 15:51:57 2015 UTC,"Kate and Reg-Ass MaxX are both present in the meta, and both are hurt pretty bad by card trashing IF you can land a blacklist.  A lot of Kate decks run low breaker numbers, and MaxX is of course helps you mill out the breakers.  Both could be practically shut down by a Blacklist behind a lotus if decoders are sniped.  Crim has always had issues with recursion, but they also have tools to get in a server in a pinch.  So you don't need the blacklist as much, but you'll need a bit more ice.  The key, of course, is keeping the runner off the agenda.  Maybe you can threaten a Midseasons, or play Argus and tax the agenda.  Or play Gagarin and tax them with asset servers.  It's not a great combo, but it has merits.  High variance, for sure."
Netrunner,3bqtjp,Kandiru,2,Wed Jul 1 16:08:38 2015 UTC,Milling may not effect the odds of winning but it can effect the players tempo. Milling runner decks that have recursion may not be quite as painful but mill the right cards can slow down their play. Mill away SMC or Clone Chip and you just potentially set a scoring window if they were hoping to face check without a breaker in play.
Netrunner,3bqtjp,Zaknafean,2,Wed Jul 1 16:15:12 2015 UTC,Here is my first pass on a deck using it:  http://netrunnerdb.com/en/decklist/23077/trashiteria
Netrunner,3bqtjp,cwoac,2,Wed Jul 1 18:41:09 2015 UTC,"There are some reason why the ""milling fallacy"" doesn't always apply. Firstly the runner has a lot of card search abilities. Self-modifying code can find you the Femme from the bottom of your stack, but it cannot take it out of your heap. The same goes for Special Order, Hostage, Focussed Assault, Djinn etc.  If you get into a position where you can mill 6 cards from the runner each turn (perhaps with a scored Utopia Shard? That makes Underway Renovation essentially impossible to steal once you've overadvanced it quite a lot.) then you can empty the runner's stack. Then kill them with damage. I don't know if it will be effective or not, but it sounds fun! You can also use it against TestRun to make them discard the top card of their stack."
Netrunner,3bqtjp,Friff14,2,Wed Jul 1 15:22:20 2015 UTC,"Isn't this essentially an agenda with the ability 'pay 1 credit and 1 click to do 1 or 2 quasi net damage'?   While you're hitting their stack, not their grip like real net damage, Jinteki 1000 cuts decks are all about forcing you into mistakes by way of inevitable doom, draining you of your health pool. I'd imagine if this was a Jinteki card, it'd be a must play. 1000 cuts Weyland never really became a thing, but I have to think this card is pointing towards that style of play."
Netrunner,3bqtjp,cwoac,1 point,Wed Jul 1 15:44:40 2015 UTC,"Don't forget Chronos project. I can kinda see a FA style deck that over advances renovation (maybe even mushin no shin if you have a safe server) w/blacklist to stop recursion, then score + FA a chronos to wipe that chunk clean. Pull that off twice and you are sitting on 6pts with 1/3-1/2 your opponent's deck off the board.  [edit:] Yeah, you mushin into a fresh server, so 'safe' in this case means you have a decent piece of ice (or two w/biotic labor!) to slap in front of it. I think in that case, you need a couple of bits of ice and you plan to spend a significant number of turns hitting it. It also strikes me as an excellent 'must-run' target like Corporate Town for slapping something nasty like an archer in front of - that trick has got me more than a couple of wins since it will usually take the runner at least a turn or two to recover then break the archer, which is a couple more turns of trashing all their resources. It does cost two agendas though."
Netrunner,3bqtjp,KaleHavoc,1 point,Wed Jul 1 12:31:13 2015 UTC,"Mushin No Shin does not advance, it 'place[s] 3 advancement tokens' on the card.  So that wouldn't discard cards.  It would, however, get into the range where you're discarding two at a time.  But I like the idea of Chronos-Underway.  I think Titan 20-agenda decks are going to love this, if for no other reason than to get rid of the 3 Vulcan Coverups that they used to have to have."

After all, a Runner must have a Sentry breaker (or at least an AI) to deal with Jinteki. But, if I happen to snipe your Mimic/Atman/Garrote from hand? Now you're potentially stuck digging for three more turns while I'm free to do as I please.  No, you're probably not going to mill the Runner's entire deck. But think of it this way: It's more or less an asset where, for one click, you can knock off a card (or two) from the stack. If you've got enough econ, enough ice, and/or are just plain bored, that's not bad. It's hardly any different than an Executive - except this thing you can score, which gives you an advantage.  Also, worst case scenario: Oh noes, 1 AP to the Runner. Whatever shall I do?  EDIT: Oh, btw. Test Run says what? Nah, Test Run (by itself) doesn't say squat. Play this, and then laugh."
Netrunner,3bqtjp,FricasseeToo,0,Wed Jul 1 23:56:16 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately this is the milling fallacy.  Yes, you might mill that important sentry breaker. But you equally might mill other cards, helping the runner draw the sentry breaker they want faster.  Just knocking a couple of cards off the top of the runner's deck is bad by itself. Unless the runner is decked, those cards you managed to mill might as well have been on the bottom of their deck in a different shuffle."

I do admit I fall victim to a number of these (I'm partial to Shinobi largely because of that one time I won on the Runner's second click of the entire game).  But I have to say, with the fallacy you're quoting: I don't get it. I don't mean that in an argumentative way; it just honestly goes over my head. I don't understand what he's saying.  That's not to say I don't see problems with Underway. You can only advance it so much before you run out of creds (unless you have the Root/Simone which takes some additional setup), plus even when you do score it, it's still just a paltry 1 point.  And I suppose that really, if every card is useful, then even if I snipe an econ card, that's okay because the rest is all programs/hardware/necessities, etc. So if every card is useful, then I'd have to destroy all of it (or at least until you take out all Fracters/Killers/etc), which IS nigh impossible to do.  But yeah, still difficult to wrap my head around."
Netrunner,3bqtjp,MagnumNopus,1 point,Thu Jul 2 01:04:43 2015 UTC,"Yeah that last paragraph of your comment, you're getting there :)  I think I read this article 3 times before I got it all. Worth keeping at it though, your deckbuilding and ingame decisions are improved with this knowledge.  edit: The key things to think about is that in a properly shuffled deck, order is totally random so the next card could be anything - or any one card could be at any place in the deck. And think about those cards the runner didn't draw before they win a game, they still won without them right? - trashing a few random cards is functionally the same as if they were on the bottom of the deck (apart from tutoring/recurring)."
Netrunner,3bqtjp,rumirumirumirumi,1 point,Thu Jul 2 01:14:22 2015 UTC,"The problem with the milling fallacy is that milling can affect odds of certain plays.  A deck with 35 cards and 2 Corroders has a lot better chance of finding their corroder than a deck with 30 cards and 1 corroder (tutor/recursion aside).  Milling can give the information needed to identify those odds.  Random milling may not make a deck better, but if you build it to take advantage of that initiative, you can make it better.    MaxX does well because she can prepare for her mill by including cards like Clone Chip, Deja Vu, and LARLA.  But the corp can also do this by slotting Blacklist, Student Loans, and Chronos Project.  Sure, Underway Renovation is not as reliable as MaxX's ability, but you can certainly use the mill to your advantage."
Netrunner,3brb0y,notminebydesign,9,Wed Jul 1 14:54:03 2015 UTC,"This is one of those topics that it's extremely hard to speak generally about. Where to put ICE depends a lot on the game state, another topic that's very hard to speak generally about. The state-space of Netrunner is extremely large and there are a lot of variables to consider.  I guess you could theoretically go over all of the prominent archetypes for Corp and Runner respectively, but that's pretty laborious to do exhaustively, and it makes for an article that has absolutely no longevity and won't be useful at all in a year because it really depends on where the meta is at.  tl;dr: It's a topic that's game state dependent and hard to write generally about. I've tried writing about reasoning under an uncertain game state before but it's a lot harder than it sounds.  If you do want to get better at this, I'd say a good idea could be to learn to play the runners you're struggling to place ICE against. Other than that, it's something you'll learn over time. Don't be scared of having a ""trial"" game when testing where you try something different to what you'd normally do: if you lose, you learnt something anyway!"

Netrunner,3brb0y,BlueSapphyre,3,Wed Jul 1 16:26:18 2015 UTC,"As Xenasis stated, it's largely context dependent. I'll give a few of the most common cases here, generally speaking, but the best thing to do is play a bunch. You'll see for yourself how things work given your ID/matchup/opponent's preferences.   RnD: typically the runner hits this several times throughout the game. Putting ICE that taxes here is generally good, ensuring the runner either can't access, or can only get in once, every turn. End the Run (EtR) ICE is usually best as the innermost piece. Jinteki loves to put stuff that hurts the runner but doesn't necessarily have to EtR here. HQ: if you're prickly, like Jinteki holding Snares, you can afford for your ICE sometimes to not be EtR (instead maybe damage of some kind). However, against Anarch and Criminal opponents, usually a good first ICE has EtR to protect against Account Siphons, Wanton Destructions, and other nasty stuff. Snare does nothing if you lose all your credits to Account Siphon on turn 1. Consider not rezzing this first ICE unless something nasty is incoming, as runners will often bait you with a facecheck just to see what breaker they need to make SURE the siphon hits. Archives: most people put something to EtR here to stop free accesses for datasuck/security testing/etc. I personally love to put something NASTY here. 1x Archer can be fun, especially if their rig's only half built. Ichi is another favorite along with Grim or anything else that trashes programs. You get the idea. Totally your choice. Remotes: Usually some combination of taxing ICE plus EtR will keep the runner out. If you're going glacier, you'll still need some kind of sysop or upgrade in the server in the end game. The runner can break anything given enough time and money. If you're rushing agendas, usually laying different cheap EtR ICE is good enough (barrier/code gate/sentry).   I change things up when I play too. I had a 1x Ichi 1.0 in my Blue Sun deck. I played 3 games against my friend one night with it. Ichi came up within the opening hand or first few draws, somehow, every game that night (oh, card games). The first 2 times I put it on RnD, as something to keep unrezzed until the right moment, then wreck his rig. He faceplanted it both times at the wrong time. The third game I put it on HQ, since there was nothing in there for him to steal. When he hit it turn one and lost his mini-rig he'd pre-built, he gave up. Moral of the story: if you think you've figured out how your opponent thinks, play counter to it and watch them squirm."

Netrunner,3brb0y,grimwalker,2,Wed Jul 1 19:25:22 2015 UTC,"The bottom line is that you need to know what's in your deck, and what's most likely to be in the opponents. It's a knowledge burden that you just have to overcome. Until then, you need to play more 'just good' ICE to make up for it. That's about all the advice you can give.   Say I have a Rototurret and an Eli in my hand versus Noise, and two rezzed Next Bronzes over HQ/R&D. And the following scenarios/thoughts:  Noise typically has one Corroder and one Mimic, two d4v1ds, and sometimes Knight. Does he have it now and can I play the odds?  Does he have Datasucker counters?  Does he have a Clone Chip with a Parasite in the heap? Do I  even want to bother wasting 4c to rez a Rototurret if it'll instantly die and not allow me to score? Or will it allow me to score?  All of this factors into my Rototurret placement and what else in my hand. The goal here is to perhaps bait Noise to run the NEXT Ice with the intention of Datasuckering it down with Parasite, but stopping/'wasting' a Parasite on the Rototurret instead, or trashing his Datasucker. The Eli 1.0 is good anywhere, but you still need to put it somewhere good. Noise is often willing to click thru Eli to see what's in a remote, so I wouldn't put it there unless you had a couple."

Netrunner,3bqzh4,grimwalker,1 point,Wed Jul 1 13:13:47 2015 UTC,"Actually, I have a CVS semi-question to piggyback here. There's no ""card memory"" in Netrunner. So if you IAA an agenda, the runner tutors a clot, and you are effectively stopped from using an astro token on a 3/2 (lets say another astro), can you then rez and pop CVS to purge, finish astro token-ing the agenda and still score it the same turn?  my thought is ""yes"" as there is no card memory of clot's effect once it's purged away."
Netrunner,3bqzh4,X-factor103,1 point,Wed Jul 1 15:35:26 2015 UTC,"You're right about the 'card memory' thing - card effects only exist if the card is in play. But in your example Clot doesn't really stop the fast advance because the Corp can immediately use the Astro token after the second advancement, as they have priority to use paid abilities before the runner in that timing window. They would need to tutor the Clot after the install or the first advancement, but then you could use CVS to fast advance."

Netrunner,3bnjcz,RestarttGaming,6,Wed Jul 1 12:08:17 2015 UTC,"In my experience, this is not altogether uncommon for Weyland players because they're trying too hard to kill the Runner instead of scoring.  I've actually milled two Weyland players out in tournaments.  That should be eye-opening for people that are trying to play kill decks.  At some point, you have to accept when a Runner is careful enough that you're not going to kill them, then take some risks yourself.  Edit:  I'm not playing solitaire Noise either.  One of those tournament milling wins was with Reina ;) (via Keyhole - if you're not trying to score while you kill me, then I won't either; I""ll just take all the murder cards away)"
Netrunner,3bnjcz,17th_knight,11,Tue Jun 30 18:01:00 2015 UTC,"I'm a weyland kill player.  I agree.  The point of kill cards isn't to kill the runner.  The point of kill cards is to make it so that the runner is punished for trying to stop you from scoring.  Take this to heart , damage decks -  your goal is to score out, and make it so the runner will lose if they let you score, but if they try and steal they lose as well.  The goal of damage decks is to force runners into a damned if you do damned if you don't, not to wait for a lucky kill."

So you have to work to stop me. Working to stop me makes you broke and low on cards in hand (as I plink away at them). I then score. You then have to rearm and attack again to prevent me killing you, which you likely will. At which point I score again. Bit by bit. Drip by drop. Until you either run recklessly and die or I score to the end.   But my deck literally would not function if I was not actively working to legitimately win the game."

I managed 4-1 that day with my version, and I think its a little more... predictable than his version (although that might be a disadvantage as well). My game plan is always just to whittle away resources with the light net damage while setting up a nice little scoring/kill server. I also like Celebrity Gift in this deck despite giving the tell - it builds money fast and sometimes I just show the EMP/Counter-strike to put the fear in the Runner and make them let me have a 3-pointer without contest."

Netrunner,3bmfmb,nialbima,2,Wed Jul 1 13:51:14 2015 UTC,"Downloaded and tried it out and here are my initial reactions:   User interface is gorgeous. It's easy to navigate. I love the sliders. Seeing card stats is easy enough though new users might not be able to see the subtype of a card but that just comes from memory after a short time. The background is perfect. I would say that you don't need the icons on the right to show the factions in your deck builder since the cards are already visible and this would give you a little more horizontal real estate.  Add a way to sort cards alphabetically: Unless you search for every single card individually, cards take forever to find. The cards being sorted by set and set-number just isn't an efficient way to find what I want to add to a deck. I may remember what set cards are from but I won't ever remember that Ichi 1.0 is number 62 so I should look for him after Heimdall 1.0. Add a way to filter cards by type (not even necessarily by subtype, though that would be a nice bonus): If I find that I have space to add an extra asset to my Gagarin deck that plays horizontally, it's really nice to easily see what my options are without weeding through the other types. If I want to add a console to my deck, I would love to filter out all the programs, events, and resources and just see what equipment the game has to offer.  Sort cards by faction: I don't know about everyone but I'd wager that most players sort their cards at least by faction. It makes physically building the deck so much easier if I don't have to constantly move across my binder, for example, from Weyland to pull out Caduceus to NBN to pull out Pop-Up Window to Neutral to pull out Private Contacts and then back to NBN to pull out Jackson and then back to Weyland to pull out The Cleaners.  Definitely find a way to import deck lists from Netrunnerdb: I can't tell you how much of a dream this would be. I spend many lunch breaks at my desk slapping together new deck ideas on Netrunnerdb and would love to have them on hand when I'm at my game store to either throw together real quick or to just show off to friends to get their opinions."

I'm really happy that someone has started working on a deck builder That's compatible with iPhone.   So the things I'd like to see so far are:   Filter by: faction, type, and if possible Custom (to filter by subtype possibly). Also, if you could implement a way to organize either alphabetically, cost, or influence. That could be cool.   Search: might be cool to include this feature separate from the deckbuilder as well. It would be a nice way of referencing cards without having to start a new deck.   Awesome job so far! Thank you for your work. Really looking forward to see where you go with this.

I want to spam my friends with lists. Importing would be nice too, I'd totally carry all my decks around high school-style if I could.      UPDATE: just realized the app can't filter by card-type.

Netrunner,3blzqh,beal2912,8,Tue Jun 30 08:23:16 2015 UTC,Another weird thing. Calimsha is not French but Belgian. So the TO decided to give the flight ticket to Worlds to the runner-up who is French. But the national bye goes to Calimsha. It create a strange situation with the Worlds ticket being sold-out with slots reserved for national champions. It technically means Calimsha has a slot reserved at Worlds and the French runner-up might not be able to play at Worlds.

I think in some netrunner decks, there are key cards that you dont want your opponent to know cause the knowledge will give your opponent an edge. The one Scorched Earth in my PE was one of those cards. If your playing Clot in a Kate is another thing.   But it seems a bit harsh to ban someone from your forums for that.  And as far as i know, there was no announcement that only a french player can win the flight before the tournament.  So it seems there is too much heat at the moment, hopefully it will cool down since its still about netrunner, a game we all love, isnt it?"

I think scouting should be warnings at first, and a game loss is an appropriate punishment for not adjusting your post-game habits if you've been warned (certainly better than a DQ).   The thing with deck scouting is that's a rule totally impossible to properly enforce. If someone want to scout a deck in the elim bracket, he can ask someone else to watch the game and give him the information by skype/facebook/twitter. At this point, we should also disallow smartphone during netrunner competition, or maybe play our tournaments in a bunker without cell which is dumb as fuck.   Everytime I came near a table for any reasons, they gave me a warning, regardless the fact that I wasn't looking at the game or sometime, I couldn't even watch."
Netrunner,3blzqh,Gmrxtrme,2,Tue Jun 30 14:56:18 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the 'up to TO' is the thing that absolutely has to change, regardless of anything else.  I personally disagree with 'Scouting' being an infraction. I have two really good reasons:   First, if I'm playing Netrunner, chances are good that I'm interested in watching games of Netrunner for their own sake and not to try and gain any advantage. Disincentivizing me from doing so is not healthy for tournament success. Second, if I can gain advantage from knowing your deck contents, it may not be a good deck. Security through Obscurity is not a valid defense, and the best decks should hold up even with 100% knowledge of the deck contents. (This is seen when top decks repeatedly win, with near-identical lists, if not straight out copies.) The only exception to this I feel is RIGHT after a new set is released, and before any matches have begun. Once you've started playing and have cards face up on a table, all bets are off. Especially if you're in a feature match and they're streaming your match.   A third reason is mentioned often as being impossible to enforce, which is another good reason, but it also applies to several other things listed as 'infractions', so I'm guessing they aren't using that as a measurement of 'what should be an infraction?'  Oh! I do want to note that while I think that 'Scouting' is ridiculous as a penalty, if a player is uncomfortable with spectators around, he should still be able to ask an official to have the spectators either move off, or be quiet, or what have you.

Netrunner,3blzqh,Argamas_ANR,1 point,Tue Jun 30 16:08:37 2015 UTC,"This seems to fall very much in line with the idea that there is a PERFECT DECK, and the majority of the reason you lose is because your deck isn't perfect enough.

Netrunner,3bmaxy,X-factor103,5,Tue Jun 30 21:43:51 2015 UTC,"I know it's not exactly what you asked for, but after reading about you spending 3 hours of fruitless deckbuilding, I thought I'd offer some general deckbuilding tips. Using these you should be able to come up with at least decent runner/corp decks of most archetypes:  Corp   number of cards. For a 45 deck sized corp, run 49 cards. For a 40 size corp, run 44 cards. These are the maximum sizes you can make, given the required agenda points, before you have to start adding more agendas. This will give you extra slots to put stuff in and dilute your agenda density. ICE balance. Assuming at 45 card deck (at 49 cards), about 14 ICE is ""normal"". Not too much, not too little. 12 ICE is low, and 16-18 is a bit high. Depending on how much ICE you want, use these guidelines. You may want more for certain glaciery identities where you want to stack ICE deep on servers. Make sure you have some cheap stuff, and some more expensive stuff. Economy. You should have 9-12 dedicated econ cards to give you enough money to function. Hedge Fund, Private Contracts, PAD campaigns, and your faction's specific cards (Beanstalk for Weyland, ""Campaign"" assets for HB, etc). If you have supplimental ways of making money, like HB's identity, even better. The Other Stuff. The rest of the deck is yours to play with. Add traps, more ICE, more econ, or fun operations tricks. Whatever you want to play with. Experiment, play, and learn!   Runner   The Basics. Some of the same stuff applies. You'll want 9-12 dedicated economy cards unless you're a Shaper and can tutor out your Magnum Opus early. That thing is an econ engine all by itself. Deck Size. Keep it lean. Unlike the Corp, you gain less by having an intentionally larger deck (unless you're building for it, but lets steer clear of that for now). Try to trim to your deck size minimum, increasing the odds of seeing the good stuff you're putting in it when you need it. Breakers. 2x of each type is typically a good starting point (fracter/decoder/killer). If you don't know what to include for your influence, I'd recommend 2x Gordian Blade and 2x Corroder at the least. Spend your killer slots on 1x Mimic and 1x of something else. Maybe Femme Fatale. The rest of the deck is yours! Toss in tutoring. Toss in ways to get your stuff back out of the trash. Throw in more econ if you love money. Include fun events like Tinkering or Inside Job to ""cheat"" your way into servers. Or just include cards you think would go well with your runner's ID, like Kate and cheap hardware.   Final tips: Visit NetrunnerDB. You can sort deck searches by cards just in packs you have. This will give you a good idea of other stuff you can pre-build given your current collection. Deckbuilding is a great aspect of this game. There's nothing wrong with looking decks up on the net while you learn, but I hope next time you decide to try it you get more from it!"

I need to play a few games with a strategist helping me out so i can get the feel for it..."
Netrunner,3bmaxy,ArgonWolf,2,Thu Jul 2 13:48:32 2015 UTC,"I can try to explain! I'm definitely not the best Netrunner player, but I think I have a good enough grasp of the basics to run it down for you.  Basically, the runner is fundamentally all about access to the corp's servers. The corp wins if their opponent can't get in, and all the points are buried in the servers. So it's about applying pressure, forcing the Corp to spend money defending themselves, figuring out how to see many cards at once (i.e. Medium), or hampering the corp's strategy somehow (Vamp, Imp, Parasite). Where and how to do that varies directly with your deck's strategy.  Generally, the tasks are A) have enough money to run effectively, B) have programs in play that can hurt the corp, C) attack the servers that you can given those first two tasks, D) do all of this efficiently before the corp wins and E) don't die. Very, very broadly, Shaper is really good at A, Anarch has a lot of stuff for B, Crim gets cards to force accesses for C and everybody needs to do D and E effectively.  Let's take Noise as an example, although he has a pretty singular style compared to a lot of other runners. Noise usually uses Aesop's Pawnshop for fuel, and virus spam for multi-access; you can and will mill them out, but Noise gets multiple accesses on an archives run more efficiently than just about anybody else because of his ability. He can advance his win condition with installs alone (task D) and Anarchs are an enormous pain in the ass (B). Slowing down the corp and forcing them to spend money, cards and clicks to stay in the game weakens the corp's servers, allowing Noise access (C) to stuff that would be much more painful if the Corp were allowed to money up, play ICE and establish a stable defensible position. The viruses advance the multi-access, and weaken the defenses, so Noise needs less money to get in (and with Aesop's or Chop-Bot, they turn back into more cards and more options).   This isn't really a ""how to run,"" description, though. You can, however, break it down into a series of questions if you need to. These are completely dependent on each other, so shouldn't be considered in isolation, but thinking them through often helps me get my head around the best play for a given situation. Also, this is not a checklist (i.e. don't run all these questions down, it'll make the game take too long and taking risks is fun).          A) Do I need more money? How much will it cost me to run the breakers I have in play? Do I need it now, or later? B) What tools do I still need? What would improve this situation? What are the odds that I can get by with what I've got so I can run this turn? C) Where can I get in? What's been rezzed? How much face-down ICE is in play? Do I need to deal with remotes (trashing econ, for instance)? What have I seen that might dictate my decision? D) Have I seen an agenda? Could any cards in play be an agenda? If I run a server, can I see more than one card at once? How many? Have I already accessed that this turn, and is it still worth trying again? E) What corp am I playing/what cards do they usually run? Do we suspect meat damage is on its way? What about net damage? Tags? If damage, how much, and do I have enough cards in hand to survive? If tags, do I need to clear them to not-die? Do I have enough money to beat a trace, if necessary? Am I at all protected? Is it my last click, and do I fear dying immediately as a result if I hit a Snare?          Making these kinds of evaluations gets a lot easier the more Netrunner you play (it's a familiarity thing, largely). It's kind of hard to get in that headspace after a text dump like this, but the fundamental question is ""how do I access cards more efficiently than the corp can score them out?"" Every deck has a different answer to that, and I hope this helps break down the ways they can go about answering it.  Let me know if this is useful.  I'm also often on OCTGN, so if you ever want some feedback or to play a game, let me know."

We'd have to do some rebalancing, but the Shoppe's effect could've just been tied to G-Mods and the Parlor's to Cyborgs e.g. Net-ready Eyes said:   When you install Net-Ready Eyes, suffer 2 meat damage unless your ID is a Cyborg.  Whenever you initiate a run, choose an icebreaker. That icebreaker has +1 strength for the remainder of the run   Similarly, the Genetics cards could double up on effects if your ID was a G-mod.

Netrunner,3bku9q,Tekim,2,Tue Jun 30 12:28:25 2015 UTC,Most people don't run exposure anyways; part of the game is reading your opponent/the situation to decide on the correct play.  Sure. But you would have a deck that supports the card in some way if you're using it (I'd go siphon spam tag-me or similar and run 3 plascretes and maybe a body suit) and you're only really vulnerable if the deck happens to run scorch/traffic; you're probably fine against the other 80% of the decks out there. It's not necessarily an early game card but an unstoppable access is pretty valuable.

However, for any pre-recorded and post-produced videos I do, I plan to continue doing commentary for those. The main problem with that is that I've been really busy doing stream-related stuff during Regionals/SMC season, and as a result the pre-recorded stuff has kind of fallen to the wayside, and is starting to become stale (all my backlogged recorded content is from just after O&C's release, pre-SanSan cycle).

Netrunner,3bj96c,dodgepong,6,Mon Jun 29 18:00:02 2015 UTC,"As a Reina player, I can vouch for how much of a pain Crisium Grid on HQ is, because it's so expensive to trash.  For bonus points, put Lotus Field in front.  Then they have a financial burden and a draw burden  in order to deal with HQ defense before they can Siphon you.  Eater won't work for breaking Lotus Field if they have to access Crisium in order to trash it, and Yog won't break this, so they're probably going to have to draw either Spooned, Crescentus, or Crypsis to deal with it."
Netrunner,3bj96c,Lluluien,1 point,Mon Jun 29 18:25:02 2015 UTC,Most Anarch decks will probably be running Net Ready Eyes now so Lotus field isn't the answer to Yog it once was.
Netrunner,3bj96c,Rejusu,1 point,Tue Jun 30 17:17:09 2015 UTC,"Except any Anarch deck running Net Ready Eyes can't run 3 Siphons and 3 Crescentus, so either there are fewer Siphons to use on you, or the draw burden shifts from Crescentus to Net Ready Eyes, and the same argument applies.  I don't disagree with you, but it doesn't change my argument.  The point is, Lotus Field isn't specifically an answer to Yog, it's to cause a draw burden because there are no decoders which handle Lotus Field elegantly which Anarchs consider good enough to include in their deck.  You can argue that NRE + Yog is the answer to that problem, but Lotus Field still causes the draw burden, which was the point of what I said in the first place."
Netrunner,3bj96c,Lluluien,1 point,Tue Jun 30 18:05:36 2015 UTC,"This (upvoted). But actually, I really like tossing a couple Melanges into a corp deck as well. I'll tell you why.  I see you're trying lots of Jinteki. I love Jinteki, and I love how prickly they can make things. Usually I beat Siphons the old fashioned way (I just can't bring myself to spend deck slots and influence most of the time). I leave ICE on HQ unrezzed until the siphon comes in. Then I lock them out. I couple this with, you guessed it, Melange, in a remote. Usually I'm able to get off a turn with it, rezzed in response to the siphon, if I've tossed one into a server with already rezzed ICE (at least 1 piece).  Bounces back very fast if they can't trash it that turn. Works well out of Blue Sun as well, since you can still pick up ICE, rez Melange, click it. Especially with Blue Sun's ability to pick up ICE for cash, you shouldn't have too hard a time retaliating with Scorches, especially if they aren't clearing tags (and tossing in a SEA Source if they are).  Finally, outside of opponents like these, Melange is a great way to generate a quick burst of cash and creates pressure for the runner to trash it. In Jinteki, where every face down card could be a trap, you can usually sneak one out pretty easily."

If soul siphon is the meta, use closed accounts. Shuts them hard and allows you to bounce back. Run 3 crisiums and have 1 on hq as often as possible. Run Tollbooth to really tax them. There's a bunch of tools to deal with siphon nowadays. Crisium is best as its also a five cost. They have to run siphon again, break ice again just to maybe get some money. Also, use things like will o the wisp to get rid of breakers so siphoning is much harder. A ton of ways to deal with siphon. Use them wisely."

Meru Mati is a fairly cheap, fairly taxing ice for that deck.  3-4 credits to rez, and it costs 4 credits to break with Eater/Corroder (although is easy to break with D4vid).  Have outs to keep your credits low to make the siphon unprofitable.  Traces and high trash assets help.  Keeping your credits is key to slowing a deck that relies on Siphon.  Or just run a DRT deck to try and hate it out.  Rez them after to drain credits from the siphon and make them think twice about stealing."

Paywall+ two pop ups means, if he's clearing tags, each account siphon is only runner spends three clicks to gain 4 and have the Corp lose two.  Much less devistating.  Throw another piece of ice In there and it's pretty much not worth it to siphon  And, since this way you almost always end the turn with cash, leaving tags is dangerous if playing a deck where scorched is an option."

Netrunner,3bj96c,kronosdev,2,Mon Jun 29 22:32:51 2015 UTC,Can concur. I have watched this matchup play out and while it is a nail-bitter Tenin almost always has the edge.
Netrunner,3bj96c,PaxCecilia,1 point,Tue Jun 30 00:58:05 2015 UTC,"Yep, this deck really screws over any decks that rely on Eater + replacement effects. It's awesome. I played this exact deck, with no prior practice, at a store championship a few weeks after O&C released, I got 4th place because of how easily all of the Eater + AS + Wanton + Singularity shenanigans got shut down."

Netrunner,3bj96c,x3r0h0ur,3,Mon Jun 29 21:00:33 2015 UTC,"Classic playing around siphon, and its much more effective than the eater-siphon maxx that is good now, because theres less good economy that isn't siphon.    Basically the key plays are leaving things to rez in response putting you to 0.  This combines with the HQ ice and the assets to always dip to 0 until you can suddenly burst so much that the siphons matter less, hopefully after they've burned a few of their siphons.  Without levy, they're very limited.  So the key is not let them make money on the siphons, and eventually outpace them.  Blue Sun is the best ID against siphon spam builds, period."
Netrunner,3bj96c,markusjarlstig,2,Mon Jun 29 23:55:07 2015 UTC,"I'm not really sure how it can be difficult to tech against siphon spam? Tag punishment, Crisium Grids and Caprice.

Netrunner,3bj96c,JohnQK,1 point,Mon Jun 29 19:55:41 2015 UTC,"You beat account siphon one of two ways: have less than $5, or have more than $5.   If you have less than $5, grabbing 2 tags isn't worth it. Account Siphon is effectively a 3 click event that only nets them 6 (if they got in for free). The less they get, the less worth it the turn is. When they run, start rezzing those assets.  If you have more than $5, then the $5 hit isn't that bad. It's like you rezzed a medium sized ice that got parasited."

These kind of Siphon-based decks are very strong, but become very mangeable after you ""get"" how they work. I would try to focus on testing and playing more than in building a deck to beat it.  If not, any HB deck with Adonis, Eve should be a good choice as they are easy to play and more ""normal"" than other denial-resistant decks like Genomics."
Netrunner,3bij37,MagnumNopus,8,Mon Jun 29 14:42:36 2015 UTC,"First time poster but I was at the regional so I thought I'd respond  I'm pretty new to competitive play with the Chicago regional being only my 2nd tournament. It was a great day and Pastimes did a great job running this, at least in my limited experience. I ended up 8-6 (enough for 31st and that sweet big head Reina alt-art) and was pretty much around the .500 tables all day so take this info for what it's worth. The turnout seemed great for an event like this- in total I believe there were 88 players at the start and not too many dropped by the end. It seemed like people were coming from all over the midwest which was a bit surprising, but cool to see. I played someone from Minneapolis, Ohio, and Louisville and heard of some travelling from maybe as far as Oklahoma or maybe even farther.  In my games as corp (playing Butchershop NEH) I faced- 2 PPVP Kates, Nasir w/ stealth, 2 Valencia, Quetzal with account siphon and Reg-Ass Maxx- it was strange to not see any criminal and apparently that was the experience for most people. Anarch was all over and of course Kate was very popular. I heard there were no criminals in the top 8 (that was the cut) but I'm not positive.  As runner (with pancakes Noise) I faced- Harmony Medtech, Jinteki PE, 2 NEH (one butchershop one fastro), 2 blue sun, and a nisei division. There was definitely at least one HB deck in the top 8 so that was out there as well. I was surprised not to see any RP but the eventual winner, third place, and 6th place all were playing it so it was probably just far away from me the whole day (which I'm not too sad about!)   Overall, it was a blast to play in this regional- the field seemed diverse although there were tons of Anarchs. Met a lot of cool people too. Also, The prize support was great, I think they gave the whole field an older alt-art like Wyldside or Plascrete which was pretty sweet. The stimhack forum is great too for a recap but just in case you wanted a more newbish perspective, here ya go."

Well, Chicago pretty much is the most important city in the midwest. St. Louis and Detroit are/were pretty big contenders for that spot too.

Netrunner,3bij37,Ixidane,6,Tue Jun 30 15:34:56 2015 UTC,"Nice turnout, well-run event. I took Blue Sun and Whizzard, ended up taking 10th, missing the cut by .04 SoS. There was a 6-way tie of 20 prestige for 5/6/7/8/9/10! I was the highest-placing Weyland player, bringing Keystone 3.0 after testing 20-some different iterations of it off and on for several months, so it was nice to see some success in that. Ended up playing against 2 Reina, Quetzal, Hayley, Andy, MaxX, and Whizzard. Lots of Anarch on the day."
Netrunner,3bij37,ItJustGotRielle,5,Mon Jun 29 18:29:37 2015 UTC,"I went and had a lot of fun playing a lot of new players. Went with a stealth Hayley build and Grail RP. I usually place somewhere in the middle of most tournaments but that day I just got wrecked. Combination of bad luck, bad draws, and a couple of dumb moves. Can I run R&D turn one and hit snare with a great hand? Sure can. Gonna score out my agenda for the win next turn? Go ahead, top deck my Future Perfect, win psi game, and grab my other 2 pointer that's also after the FP for the win. Blargh. I always seem to overthink stuff in tournament settings and just screw up and it hurt me bad that day. Overall though it was great getting to play so many new players then what I usually play against. I was gonna write up a report but seeing as how I basically dropped to the bottom and stayed there I don't think it'd be that great of a read =P"
Netrunner,3bij37,Dominion_Prime,4,Mon Jun 29 19:10:08 2015 UTC,"I think I got 24th? My last round match result was misreported so that my opponent, who lost both games, was listed as the winner of both, so the standings had me in 51st. We talked to the TO, but he didn't need to correct it since it didn't have any impact on my prize support or the finish of other players. If I did the math correctly, I got somewhere in the 20's. Kind of a disappointing finish but nonetheless it was a well-attended and fun event. I had a blast. My opponents were all cool people, and I had some really interesting conversations about Netrunner and other stuff.  I played a standard RP deck with the only ""tech"" being 2x Interns against the anticipated Anarch-heavy field.  It seemed like Anarch was massively popular, but my Runner opponents were Kate, Kate, Kit, Haley, Andy, Noise, Noise.  I had some really terrible games with RP including one where I mulliganed into Tollbooth, Hedge Fund, Chronos Project, Nisei MK II, Future Perfect.  I chose to ICE RnD against my Kate opponent and then couldn't draw more ICE except a Lotus Field a couple turns later.  I found our lord and savior before I got totally blown out on HQ but unfortunately got re-flooded soon thereafter.  With only Tollbooth and Lotus Field, Gordian Blade did some serious work.  That was against Blain who later made top eight, and we joked about the game after.  His draws were also pretty bad, and the game was the least typical Kate vs RP I've played in quite a while.  I also had a pretty one-sided game against Noise in which he was able to mill most of my ICE early on and I never could defend a Sundew or my centrals. Otherwise RP was rock solid and I wouldn't have changed much with my list.  I played CT Stimshop as my Runner. It performed really well outside of a game in which I couldn't find Magnum Opus. That's definitely a typical problem for the deck and what I get for only playing two Test Runs.  My Corp opponents played PE, Blue Sun, Core Weyland, HB ETF x3, and NEH Astrobiotics.  I feel bad for the ETF guys since CT has a fantastic matchup against HB Glacier.  It's pretty hard to tax out Magnum Opus + Stimhack, especially when you need to build a scoring remote to get the 5-for-3's online. The highlight was my last round opponent (Nick, IIRC) firing an Accelerated Beta Test into Janus 1.0, Heimdall 2.0, and Ichi 2.0. I proceeded to make a ridiculous amount of money from MOpus and fired three Maker's Eyes through his massively defended RnD.  It was costing me something like 15 to get into RnD, even after Femme-ing his Janus.  I was digging really deep with Maker's + RDI, and he never got a chance to draw Jackson to save himself.  Overall the event was a really good time, and I'm glad I was able to attend. The crowd was really friendly, and my opponents played well."
Netrunner,3bij37,Willingdone,3,Mon Jun 29 20:08:58 2015 UTC,"Glad I wasn't the only one who got wrecked by Blain's Kate. He told me after the fact that it was Calimshas 46 card list (card for card I believe). He piloted it extremely well though. Playing NBN, I got excited when he used a clone chip to fetch a lady before his 3rd click to run. Last click he put the clot down from hand and ruined the impending astro train. /dreams crushed."

I was running whizzard which turned out to be a poor decision as most of my opponents were going for operation heavy Econ packages.

Netrunner,3bi96m,EARL_OF_CUTS_MANOR,2,Mon Jun 29 13:11:19 2015 UTC,"I strongly disagree with Hollis's comments on Regionals, and feel he has been seriously misinformed.   Seats are reserved for all Nationals Champions (though they don't necessarily get airfare), and for American Regional winners (though, yes, it would be nice to get reserved seats for regional winners from other countries as well).    I will complain about an invitational format, and I'm not a bad player by any stretch (10th at a 153 player UK Nats, 2nd at a 63 person regional).  I think that it's not inclusive, and I think Netrunner is still too small to be having tournaments that are turning people who want to attend away because ""You aren't good enough"".  It seriously leaves a sour taste in players' mouths.  I don't want to travel halfway across the goddamn world to play in a Last Chance Grinder.  I want to travel across the world to play at WORLDS.  Requiring players to play in that sort of grinder will seriously depress attendance (Attendance at Nats doubled in the UK when they shifted from a invitational system to an open system - while regional attendances only increased by aroudn 50%).  And yes, I bought tickets - I was based in Europe, and it wan't hard for us to get hold of them - 6pm BST/7pm CET.  And I didn't make the decision at 6pm on June 13th.  I had 2 weeks to make that decision after FFG announced how World was goign ot work.  I'd still rather Worlds was completely open, and attendance be uncapped.  Inclusivity is the best way to grow the game.  FFG should really abnadon thier attachment to the FFGC and think about hosting the regional at a more sensible loaction, e.g. a convention centre that can hold at least 500+ playesr; ecuase I genunieyl believe they can run a 500 person Netruunner worlds if they had it uncapped.

Netrunner,3bi96m,Drillsmasher,-5,Thu Jul 2 12:08:10 2015 UTC,"I'll put this from the tourney rules again as it seems you didn't read it  Players must maintain a pace to allow the match to be finished within the announced time limit. Stalling is not acceptable  Considering his deck has no kill then to win he needs to score agenda's. His play with IT made it impossible to finish the game in time, therefore he did NOT maintain a pace to allow the match to finish in time.

Netrunner,3bi96m,TheCheatingAgenda,3,Thu Jul 2 06:38:01 2015 UTC,"Haha, sounds like you've been on the wrong end of the deck a few too many times. What is key in that passage you quoted is 'pace of play'. These rules are designed so that both players have a relatively even amount of time to play the game.  The wording is not 'players must attempt to win' for many reasons. Some of these include leaving judge calls to opinion (""gaining 3 credits? No way hes trying to win with a play like that! Disqualified!"") and Netrunner being a game of  not just you trying to win, but preventing the opponent from winning (there IS a reason for mandatory agenda points in deckbuilding, ya know).  Regardless, the only time the tournament structure supports these defensive decks that can take a long time to win is in top 8 when you are the higher seed. In all other cases (mainly swiss rounds) you are disadvantaged by going to time."

Cards that are hosted on apartments have to be installed, so are active.  You install apartments first.  It is active.  Then you install a supplier, hosting it on apartments.  It is active.  Now you host a second supplier on the first, using the ability of supplier.  Suppliers ability gets around the need to install the card so the second supplier is not installed and not active, so can't host anything or use any abilities, and isn't yet subject to the unique rule.  You can continue to use supplier one as much as you want.  Cards hosted on it are just hosted on it, not installed, and not hosted on apartments, so don't get the draw from apartments and their abilities are inactive.    Once the cards hosted on supplier one get off of supplier and are actually installed, they can be installed on apartments for the draw or not.  If you ever try to install the second supplier, the unique rule kicks in.  The key difference here is what cards are installed and what cards are not installed (regardless of if they are hosted or not)"
Netrunner,3bjolz,RestarttGaming,1 point,Mon Jun 29 20:05:58 2015 UTC,"What's the distinction between the way the cards are worded? The Supplier doesn't specify that you are not installing the cards you are hosting on it, it's only implied in the start of turn effect below.  Off-Campus Apartment similarly doesn't specify that cards hosted on it are installed; you have to infer that from the text below.  It's a little clearer than mud, but still not comfortably clear/straightfoward to me. Why don't they say:    click: Host a card on The Supplier. Install a connection on Off-Campus Apartment as a hosted card.   Am I missing some subtle nuance about the fact The Supplier has a paid ability cost (in the form of a click) and Off-Campus Apartment doesn't?"
Netrunner,3bjolz,itscoolbroh,2,Tue Jun 30 22:59:54 2015 UTC,"There's a distinction you may be missing.  The supplier has a click action that lets you host a card on it from your grip, without installing it.  Apartments has no such ability.  Apartments doesn't have a way to get the card out of your hand, so you've got to get it out of your hand somehow first.  When using apartments, you have to use the basic ability of a runner (spending a click to install a card) to install the card your going to want to host, like you do with every other install.  When installing it, you can chose to install it on a card that can host it or to install it as normal without hosting.  So in short -supplier has an ability that cheats a card onto it without installing.  Apartments doesn't, so you have to install like normal to get the card into play in the first place, and while installing you can decide where to install it to."

I did well with NEH FA at store champs and regionals and just generally, but feel like many of its weaknesses can be shored up with HB ETF FA, especially some of the hybrid builds. The idea of playing relatively cheap but taxing ice, playing biotic in faction, and also being able to effectively import caprice, whilst playing some of the strong asset economy in the game just makes it seem like the deck of all trades. The agendas are what usually make me go back to NEH (and to a lesser extent the infaction sansan, jackson, dbs) but I will def try a bit of HB Glacier/FA hybrid over the coming weeks"
Netrunner,3bj96e,ErikTwice,1 point,Tue Jun 30 02:43:21 2015 UTC,"I think NEH is stronger, but HB offers a much higher degree of control since it allows both taxing and bluffing facedown cards in a remote.

Anticipating your opponent's moves is key, and the way the corp sets up their defenses end up being an interesting puzzle for the runner to solve. If they are being passive players that might lead them to acting slowly, building a board state, and then simply following a game plan, but more aggressive play requires you to think about what your opponent is doing and respond accordingly.  You say they like the deckbuilding aspect of the game. Threat might be an avenue for you to demonstrate the inherent interactions that take place in the game. In corp decks it's harder to do effectively, but in the runner there's ways to turn a set of cards into a many-tentacled beast which requires anticipation of the corp's moves, ways to force actions by the corp, and the skill to read the game in order to choose the best path."

With time and experience of the game you'll come to see other layers to the Noise matchups, but if you've got relatively newcomers then Noise can easily leave them cold.

Headlock Reina, on the other hand, is a deck by Sam Suied that approaches the concept of economical warfare with Lampreys, Vamps, and Crescentus (extra credit for Reina!). While still milling the deck with Keyhole.  Lastly, you could say Soul Siphon is the bastard child of these two. It uses Siphon and Eater/Crescentus to get the same results. Keeping them from rezzing R&D ICE to access big chunks of R&D with Medium.

There's such a huge element of bluffing and hidden information. How I play is completely different based on both who I'm playing against and what I've seen of their deck.  I think the best way to combat this would be to challenge their assumption by playing against their expectation.  If they always try to run remotes, install traps or expensive assets/upgrades behind huge walls of ice to drain their economy.  If they never run unadvanced cards, install naked 3/2s and score them until they realize it's massively important to pay attention to what their opponent is doing and what their deck is capable of."
Netrunner,3bi3h1,Lonailan,2,Mon Jun 29 13:03:17 2015 UTC,"This is a really good question.   As others have already said, playing decks which are inherently more interactive is one way of forcing players to, well... interact, but there are a lot of other things that could help as well. I'll give some advice from my experience which I found helped me engage with the other player more.   A game is a dialogue, and usually the runner is the one who sets the tone. If the runner doesn't pressure the corp early game, but instead focuses on playing passively for too many turns, the game can feel stale pretty quickly. This often leads to the bad experience of staring at a corp with tons of facedown ICE and money, feeling a bit overwhelmed about what to do, and just wanting to play like a turtle even more.  The corp can also try to force the runner to engage with them, perhaps by installing valuable high trash cost assets/upgrades in naked remotes (to give the runner a difficult decision to make) or risking an agenda early game behind a cheap end the run ice.  Overall, one of my favorite aspects of the game is the constant risk/reward decisions on either side of the table, and maybe your friends have just been playing a bit to risk-averse, maybe get them to loosen up a bit :P"

If you come from a highly interactive game like Magic then Netrunner can feel very disconnected.  I think your best bet is to build a very interactive runner, like Headlock Reina.  That should allow them to see how you can impose your will on the opponent, and Reina also runs a lot so that encourages interaction.  Playing something like Kate instead is relatively non-interactive as both of you spend a lot of time focussing on building your own positions waiting for the eventual fights to come.

Netrunner,3bhoca,RogueCarpet,-2,Mon Jun 29 23:03:29 2015 UTC,You need a tag or a trace to hurt the runner with meat damage.
Netrunner,3bhoca,Bsq,12,Mon Jun 29 10:02:32 2015 UTC,"See Contract Killer.   And this is the custom thread. The idea is to create new stuff. If you keep being hung up on old ideas, how's the creativity going to flow?"
Netrunner,3bhoca,sigma83,0,Mon Jun 29 10:10:28 2015 UTC,"I hate contract killer.   It's not to stop creativity, but this is against the principle of the game, you can't hurt the runner if you don't know where he is.   Part of what makes Netrunner good is that the theme is tied to the mechanics. There are some weird things (contract killer is one of them) but most often it follow a logic.  Contract killer at least is kinda ok thematically. The killer is hunting down the runner on it's own and it only takes time. Your card don't, I don't see what is happening here."
Netrunner,3bhoca,Bsq,3,Mon Jun 29 10:19:02 2015 UTC,"I assume that the corp is levelling a city block simply because they don't know where the runner is. Blowing up the newly renovated oaktown, calling up that bounty that they decided to pull earlier and using their new business (that rumours say was taken in an hostile takeover) to get a very approximate location then blow them all up.  The runner bounced off ten terminals to access your server. Time to blow up those ten terminals and whilst we are at it, every terminal that links to those.  The only change (for theme) I'd make is make the card give the corp a ton of bad pub even though it will never come into play, it feels pretty thematic."
Netrunner,3bhoca,SmilingGak,3,Mon Jun 29 10:28:32 2015 UTC,"Well, I think the Corp levels the city block because at least know the runner's approximate location... I mean you need a tag first.  But then a tag also allows the Dedicated Response Team and Private Security Forces to find the runner, so precisely what a tag represents is uncertain.  For me I always saw Scorched Earth as they knew exactly where the runner was but had decided to 'take off and nuke the place from orbit'.  It's the only way to be sure, after all.  Anwyay, I think the original card design is pretty poor, you've got a card that cannot get played 95% of the time, and then the 5% it can get played it's completely non-interactive and unfun anyway."
Netrunner,3bhoca,satellite_uplink,3,Mon Jun 29 12:15:36 2015 UTC,"This is a fair point. I thought the agenda requirements and the fact that if the runner keeps a full handsize (or has a larger than normal handsize) would be enough, but it's hard to say without actually testing it."

My mindset started to change when I started to think of them as programmable Inside Jobs. Telegraphed, yes, but now on-call, only when you really want to, and possibly usable on multiple layers of ice.  I've been messing with a deck that's convinced me of the disposable cloud breakers' power. I'll preface this by saying that this deck is truly janky trash, but I've won more matches than I should have in part thanks to people underestimating the suite. My deck is an Andy deck that runs Scheherazade, cloud breakers (sans Shiv 'cos it hadn't been released), regular breakers (Corroder, Faerie, Femme, Mimic, Zu) and Au Revoir Snitch.  Due to the nature of the deck requiring stupid amounts of set-up, most of your turns involve drawing and installing. Setting cloud breakers onto Scheherazade is surprisingly good. The Corp usually realises that they ought to rush before I finish setting up, starts scoring out behind an ice or two. However, even 1 Mimic, a couple of Crowbars and a Spike out means you can scoot past an Eli for free. I've managed to Crowbar a Turing, then Spike Eli to contest the third agenda, and I think it's in these situations that the suite shines. The power of the suite lies in saying ""Hey Corp, did you think you had a scoring window? You think I don't have enough creds to get in and contest the second agenda? I didn't think I had enough creds either, but let me break this Eli for free, spit in that Enigma's eye while I'm at it, and pay 3 for another Enigma. Welp, turns out I can get in on 3 creds. Who'dathunk?""  Your deck must be able to accommodate the cloud breakers if you want to make use of them to the best effect, but I believe that they're powerful midgame tools that tide you into the lategame. They make long setup times less vulnerable to Corp's just rushing out agendas, and if you still haven't finished using them up by the late game, they work as subsidisers. They do, however, require precision. If you cannot guarantee that you're making a high-value run, then you don't want to pop them. It sucks to pop two Spikes past two Elis, only to see a Jackson get used at the end.  Edit: They're supplemental by nature, but they work well if your deck is able or wants to install many cheap things. It helps if your board state gets super cluttered. The Corp usually stops paying attention to your side of the board quickly, until you show them that you can actually get in for free. Crowbar-ing a remote Turing was probably the most fun thing I've done so far with it."
Netrunner,3bg3xf,Argolquich,3,Sun Jun 28 23:10:22 2015 UTC,"First, I'd like to see a decklist! Au Revoir/Snitch combo, regular breakers, and cloud breakers? This is something I've got to see. I like Scheherazade for the cloud breakers, didn't think of that. If you're installing a ton of cheap programs on it, you're either breaking even or even getting a couple bucks here and there. Makes me a little nervous about using it now that NRE is on the scene, and justifying the inclusion of Power Shutdown more these days. With a monster setup like this, ""Power Shutdown for zero"" might be a phrase that causes me to forfeit a game. Hmm. Maybe the cheap pieces do enough to combat this, but I don't want to not use the Faeries, you know?  Do you use Autoscripter? If you're doing this out of Andy, this is a whole lot of clicks; drawing these pieces, and playing them out, and having all of this not being able to do very much until mid game, in addition to getting money and supplemental pieces. I would think that Autoscripter would save some of those clicks if you're installing so many programs, but it is fragile; you have to be able to effectively guarantee successful runs in order for its inclusion to be worthwhile. I really do think Autoscripter could go a long ways in solving this issue.  This all seems also particularly weak to fast advance strategies. Being Criminal, you won't really be able to threaten Clot, and the corp will know this; rushing to get pieces out or no, you'll have to threaten centrals, otherwise you'll just watch the corp play solitaire, and you've lost, and all you've got to show for it is a lot of installed programs. With all of the pieces you mentioned above in the deck already, do you have the deck slots to combat this problem? I'd be nervous playing a deck like this wherever fast advance might rear its head, and as much as Clot has thrown a wrench in it, I don't think its gone away nearly as much as people have thought.  Lastly, what is your link setup like? I don't think there's a clear answer for what to do about getting up to 2 for the cloud property to kick in. Dyson is a bit expensive, and you probably don't need the memory; Access to Globalsec is cheap, but do you really want a bunch of copies of that in a deck?; Forger uses up a console slot, and gives zero additional memory - that could be a Desperado!; other link options are splashed from out of faction, and so you don't want a whole bunch of copies of them. Also, at that point, do you want Underworld Contacts? I mean, they're right there, you've done all the work at that point. Hmm. Let me know what you think."
Netrunner,3bg3xf,Argolquich,3,Mon Jun 29 00:28:47 2015 UTC,"Arabian Storm (45 cards)    Andromeda: Dispossessed Ristie   -- Event (9 cards)    2 Career Fair   2 Express Delivery   2 Legwork   3 Sure Gamble   -- Hardware (8 cards)   2 Box-E   2 Cybsoft MacroDrive   2 Dyson Mem Chip   2 R&D Interface   -- Program (19 cards)   3 Au Revoir   1 Corroder   2 Crowbar   2 Faerie   1 Femme Fatale   2 Mimic   2 Scheherazade   2 Snitch   3 Spike   1 ZU.13 Key Master   -- Resource (9 cards)   2 Mr. Li   1 Sacrificial Construct.   3 The Supplier   3 Underworld Contact.   Allow me to reiterate: this deck is jank. It's not good. It is, however, one of the few decks I've built from scratch that I haven't seen out there. I'm a little proud of it, but it's still a very early version and needs tons of tweaking to be viable.  You're right about Power Shutdown. That's why I slotted in one Sacrificial Construct. I like that Shiv is 0 cost too, but I don't know if I'd cut Faeries for Shivs. Faeries are just too good.  I don't use Autoscripter, mostly because the moment I use Snitch and jack out, it blows up in my face :P it might be worth a shot, though I frequently test defences early game without committing to accesses. It might actually make you slower, in that sense.  Spoiler alert: this deck folds to Butchershop. You have no cash early on, no plascretes, nothing. The only reason I dare to do this, is because I know my meta doesn't like Butchershop. Against Fast Advance, it's very uncomfortable for you since you have to pressure AND set up. You can put up a struggle, but you frequently have to let the first agenda go through, and if it's an Astro, you're in a really tough spot. Probably the only FA matchup you're sort of alright with is HB ETF glacier FA, those funky hybrids showing up these days. The key is to pretend you're Stealth/Supplier Andy, then throw out a few cloud breakers across a couple of turns and contest the remote unexpectedly, or hit them with Legwork when you suspect they're about to score. Now that I think about it, Gang Sign might have a place in this deck.  Dysons are my main only way of getting link. It sucks to only have 2 link cards, but you can often go to 4 mem on this comfortably, and you're always digging with Mr Li anyway, so you'll hit it rapidly. If you don't, there's Express Delivery to do the needful. I'm running Box-E because I like holding my Au Revoirs in hand. I don't like showing that I have them until I'm ready to throw down two at least, because once you show one, the Corp realises that they have to really rush out before you set up. Installing cloud breakers tips them off to unorthodox plays you might have, but it doesn't compel the same response and can even prompt them to slow down in fear of you sniping through the remote. Underworld Contacts are practically free money, since you have link and you have Supplier. Besides, taking 3 at the start of your turn, then spending 3 clicks to gain 9 and spending the last click to lock R&D is very brutal.  Again, this deck is not good. I want to make it good, but it's primary weakness is being slow as balls and needing a good start. Hence, Andy. If you've got any advice, I'd like to hear it!"
Netrunner,3bg3xf,Argolquich,1 point,Mon Jun 29 01:01:17 2015 UTC,"Hah, this is much more out there than I expected! I like it, but I'm concerned, like you are, about the speed (and really, therefore, effectiveness) of it.  As with any Crim deck that runs Au Revoir/Snitch, you are so frighteningly draw dependent I don't think I'd ever have the confidence to run it. Andy helps, but you have so little card draw, that if you don't see Mr. Li/multiple Au Revoirs early, you'll spend all game drawing and not doing much else. With the new Crim ID, he at least speeds things up by having some innate card draw, speeding things along. Not sure about what to do about that. Earthrise might be more good card draw, but that is pretty expensive unless you see the Au Revoirs early.  Which leads me to the fact that without Au Revoir, this deck is also pretty broke. End game, you're filthy rich, but early game, you're already clicking to draw, you don't want to also be clicking for credits! Hmm. Again, this is all draw order dependent; if you see the pieces to assemble Underworld Contacts or multiple Au Revoirs early, you're broke. So, how rich you are depends on the order the cards come out (of course this is always the case, but here you need multiple combos to make money, which makes me nervous). The deck really feels like a sort of ""If the corp doesn't win by turn 12, he will never win"" deck, but lots of corps can and will do that. I've just recently come off trying to get the Professor to work, and there have been a few games of just watching the corp score out.  Supplier seems good, but it has the same problem as above; if you don't see it early, everything you need to install is around $2, which is terrible if the Supplier doesn't show his face. You'll be fighting your own deck all game long.  This is starting to feel an awful lot like I'm crapping on your deck, so I'm sorry if it comes off that way, it isn't my intention. I've just been soured lately by decks that can't set up in time, especially against the popular decks around. At my regional, I played mostly against Butchershop and NBN fast advance, and like you said, bringing something like this would be a bad idea.  The way I like to think about the effectiveness of a deck is how bad can I recover if the cards come out in the worst order possible? What is my recourse? I feel like this deck folds hard to that kind of analysis; if the bottom 15 cards hold Mr. Li, two of the Au Revoirs, and your Suppliers, you're hurting really bad. Maybe that's not a fair analysis, but it is sort of the reason that Prepaid Kate is all the rage these days: if you don't draw prepaids, you're drawing the money and breakers you need still, so you're down a couple bucks, but you can install hardware for cheap and use cheap breakers to be effective. The combo isn't necessary, it just makes you more effective. If you need combo pieces to even get off the ground, it makes me reaaaaal nervous.  Anyways, I feel like I should add something more constructive here. I think the Scheherazade route is a trap; your pieces are already cheap to install, and things become draw order dependent with it, AND it costs influence. The amount you make off it is totally dwarfed by multiple Underworld Contacts and Snitch + Au Revoir (which is the craziest money in the game once it is firing) that I don't think it is worth the effort. Similarly for the Cybsoft Macrodrive. Both of those could just as easily be two lucky finds, and you've got two card slots to speed up the deck instead. Earthrise + Career Fair + Supplier and baby, you've got a stew going.  JESUS I can't stop typing today, so I'll stop there! Anyways, getting thoughts out through my fingers and onto the screen might be useful."
Netrunner,3bg3xf,Rejusu,2,Mon Jun 29 03:14:43 2015 UTC,"I don't have a lot of time, sneaking words between work, so this reply will be a fair bit briefer.  Broadly speaking, the deck has too many moving parts:   Link. (Dyson Mem Chips) Cloud Breakers. Snitch + Au Revoir. Underworld Contacts.   These are the meat of the deck, so to speak. Then we have:   Scheherazade. The Supplier.   These two glue the deck together. Scheherazade, imo, makes playing both Au Revoir and the Cloud breakers plausible, if not very practical. Dropping Scheherazade means I should go with either one or the other, but both becomes far too unwieldy without the subsidy. The tempo cost goes from bad to untenable.  The Supplier helps to smoothen things. He gets the link out cheaper, he makes UC free. Which means that if I drop the cloud breakers, Supplier and friends can go. Honestly, he's less important in this deck than Mr Li.  My point is that the deck is, well, bloated. It has too many separate packages that can only coexist by virtue of Scheherazade and The Supplier. If I were to tune the deck to a competitive standard, I'd have to cut some of the packages. I'd probably get some replacement econ engine for the Au Revoirs, and cut Scheherazade while I'm at it. But that's a very different deck altogether, and I am aware that the current iteration has many glaring flaws. At its core, it's a novelty deck, or at least a concept deck. My present intention is to tune up the deck as is, without losing the packages core to the idea. That may be a fool's errand, and I'll eventually move to cutting, but that's where I'm coming from with this deck.  Also, I want to fiddle with Geist. But I do think that if I were to play Geist, this deck is definitely NOT the route for him. This deck is barely workable as Andy; it would be atrocious in any other ID."
Netrunner,3bg3xf,Berrr,1 point,Mon Jun 29 04:07:38 2015 UTC,"Haha, I like your perspective on things! Maybe you've convinced me to at least take this thing out for a spin, see how it goes. Probably a fun time when the pieces come online, at least!  I think I agree with your own analysis wholeheartedly (well, as much as one can without actually taking it out for a spin). From the bloat, to what manages to hold the stitches together (even if the stitches are themselves barely holding together), to what you'd lose by taking the scalpel to it. I think I have to agree, Geist doesn't fit well here; the bloated initial hand size is too important to get rolling out of the gate. Definitely unconventional. I like the off the wall thinking!"
Netrunner,3bg3xf,Rejusu,1 point,Mon Jun 29 08:52:09 2015 UTC,The thing is that with Kate you're going to be levying at some point so even if you don't see your prepaids early on the first pass through your deck you'll have them for the second.
Netrunner,3bg3xf,DaveyCricket,1 point,Mon Jun 29 11:36:31 2015 UTC,"Well sure, but your money doesn't depend on prepaids. And, the deck moves so quickly, by the time you go through it a second time, the machine is firing on all cylinders. My point is just that getting the relevant breakers online is already sort of order dependent (you need the right ones from your deck to match the types of ice you're running into, and then simply cash to fuel them), and having your money be order dependent as well is a dangerous game if your deck decides to fight you - doubly so if you don't have huge draw to compensate."
Netrunner,3bg3xf,Berrr,3,Mon Jun 29 19:30:43 2015 UTC,"I'm looking at them a bit like the Cerberus breakers - they're part breaker, part econ. So if they use up a few more deck slots than most breakers, it might be OK because they also help with econ.  I imagine I would combo them with:   Zu13: because for only 1 credit and no MU, you've now boosted all the B&E breakers strength. I'd put 2-3 Zu13, and probably install all of them that I draw. Inside Job: It's almost another B&E - break another ice for free - continuing the theme of not paying (much) to beat ice. But as a surprise event it can work nicely with B&E to close down a scoring window. Drive By: Avoids wasted runs so well. If the card targeted is an Agenda, gogogo you can probably get in. Otherwise, you saved your breakers, and trashed the card as well.   Central-only breakers and Crescentus seem good as well.  I'm not entirely convinced either though. If we do find a way to make it good, it'll certainly be a different criminal deck to the current 'standard' criminal builds."
Netrunner,3bg3xf,TragadorD,2,Mon Jun 29 00:30:53 2015 UTC,"My main problem with Zu13 is the influence cost, otherwise I'm totally on board with your first point. If using cloud breakers (especially with the new Crim ID), Clone Chip is too good a deal to pass up, and that is a good chunk of influence right there. Is 12 inf on Clone Chip + Zu13 the right choice here? I don't know.  Inside Job pairs up with the cloud breakers great, I agree. Doubly so due to the fact that it takes time to set up enough to get to critical mass, and Inside Job can prevent the corp from just abusing your slow start if they go for early agenda rush.  Last, expose still leaves a bad taste in my mouth, extra for a double. However, the threat of trashing what is in the server I think goes a long ways towards getting baited out. Maybe I'm not giving this card a fair chance. A free trash is a free trash, too. Hmm. I think I should reconsider my stance on this.  I am happy that if these breakers come together, that it isn't just ""Security Testing, Desperado, make successful runs"". But really, that is just so damned effective. A different type of economy is required for these breakers. I think Security Testing economy is right out -  otherwise you'll burn through the cloud breakers too quickly, and be unable to make access when it counts. With the requisite two link required, is Underworld Contacts too slow? Runner drip economy is strong, and the problem is usually with how difficult it is to get rolling. If we're bothering with 2 link in the first place, is this the route to go?"
Netrunner,3bg3xf,Whale_Rider,2,Mon Jun 29 02:26:11 2015 UTC,"Just going to point out that drive by is an excellent counter to Caprice, and to a lesser extent, Ash. Given the prominence of RP being able to screw with their taxing scoring remote without having to actually go in there is useful. Killing Caprice before she's rezzed is great as otherwise you have to win a psi game if you want to take her out."
Netrunner,3bg3xf,TragadorD,1 point,Mon Jun 29 12:20:05 2015 UTC,"What worries me here is that once Drive By enters the card pool, stronger players will recognize this as a possibility. In a match against RP, say, an unadvanced card gets put in an already sturdy looking remote; we all know that is either Caprice or Ash, and there's no mystery to it. The only reason the corp doesn't rez it early is because he usually is under no pressure to.   With Drive By, what's to stop them from just rezzing Ash/Caprice early to defend against it? Now Drive By doesn't work, the corp is down 2 credits that they were going to be anyways, and the upgrade is just as hard to access as it would have been otherwise."
Netrunner,3bg3xf,TragadorD,1 point,Mon Jun 29 19:34:23 2015 UTC,"Apparently in a Drive By world, you may also want to bring a gun."
Netrunner,3bg3xf,bkohler13,1 point,Wed Jul 1 23:28:48 2015 UTC,"Yeah you're right Zu13 x3 is a lot of inf. Maybe just 2x. It definitely seems good though.  Agreed about Inside Job. It'll almost certainly be a really valuable card with the B&E set.  Definitely give Drive By a chance, that trash effect is so good, I'm expecting this card to be popular and played quite a bit (possibly only 1-2x, but it's gonna do some work!).  Yeah I think any time you already have/need 2 link, Underworld Contacts is worth considering. You can even just throw in 1-2 copies to install as 'bonus econ'. Depending what other MU-costing cards go in this deck, I can see Data Folding potentially work too. You might have a half dozen programs installed and still 3 MU free!"
Netrunner,3bg3xf,SevenCs,2,Mon Jun 29 07:14:37 2015 UTC,"Hmm, the idea is coming together a bit in my head now. Something that relies a bit more on precision running, and doesn't mind getting the link for the breakers and letting the drip econ roll in a little bit. With Drive By to check for when a run needs to be made/asset needs to be trashed, could be an idea for a runner that waits for the moment to pounce, similar to those Leela Logos decks. Thanks for the input!"
Netrunner,3bg3xf,Wakks,2,Mon Jun 29 08:06:09 2015 UTC,"I played a LOT of Iain in preparation for Geist.  I think they will play very similarly because of the setup times.  With Iain I didn't even bother worrying about his ability half the time, it more served as a boost just in case I got behind.    I used The Woman in the Red Dress as the main check, with spot expose as needed.  Every turn I would start and my opponent would show me what server I needed to hit.  She saves an extraordinary amount of time just by giving you both that small amount of information. HQ Interface is really good with her because if they decide to draw the agenda then you just hit the hand and likely see it.   Drive By is amazing with this setup because not only does it show you if you need to care, it also trashes anything that isn't a point.  Often times Iain would have to spend money just to make sure they don't start some crazy IT Dept shenanigans or other some such.  With DB you just play it."
Netrunner,3bg3xf,PanzerD,2,Mon Jun 29 15:32:57 2015 UTC,"I have yet to put a list together for this, but I really am itching to try making this work with Sage in the new Geist ID.  The idea would be to run 1 or 2 of the code gate and barrier cloud breakers, and 3 of Shiv. Keep your memory as clear as possible, using Desperado or Box-E to be at str 3 or 4 and then Dyson Mem Chips to trigger cloud suite and bring Sage to str 6 or 7.   The rest is up in the air, some faeries to hold in hand until needed and net-ready eyes do seem like a thing. Recursion will be a must so clone chips will eat up 6 influence, and sage another 3 to 6 leaving  just a few options left."
Netrunner,3bg3xf,PanzerD,1 point,Mon Jun 29 05:15:45 2015 UTC,"Sage! Huh, wasn't thinking that! Once set up, this rig could be a monster, but that's the problem I have with this sort of thing - the time to set it up could be unruly.  Other pieces fall together as well; with the extra memory and link, both Data Folding and Underworld Contacts are online, so including those could generate insane cash. Can the cards be drawn fast and cheap enough in faction to get this sort of thing online fast enough to be a threat? Maybe Supplier with Earthrise, judicious use of the cloud breakers and Geist's ID ability to just yank cards out of your deck as fast as you can and get them installed quickly.  Hmm, not sure about the viability (read: consistency) of this sort of idea, but it sure sounds fun. If you come up with a list I'd be interested to see it."
Netrunner,3bg3xf,PanzerD,1 point,Mon Jun 29 08:16:56 2015 UTC,"The Iain deck I was running did all of that minus the sage and I will say it can be really threatening.  The big thing I found is resisting the temptation to ""jump"" on the remotes they are making.  You have to remain calm and really ask yourself what losing those points would cost you.  There were many many games where I left the Corp at 6 points and just hammered them late game with 40+ credits and four runs a turn.  It is hard to score that last point when literally no place is safe.  Iain has gone from 0 points to 7 in a matter of turns if played calmly.  I would take 5+ actions a turn before my first click was even used just from all the ""start of turn"" effects resolving."
Netrunner,3bg3xf,PanzerD,1 point,Mon Jun 29 16:01:40 2015 UTC,"I've always had a soft spot for decks like these, because I like the inevitability; in practice, however, I found that I often just lost straight out to fast advance/rush strategies, and got frustrated that I had no recourse. There were simply not enough clicks for me to spare to be able to put up a fight. I'm not a fan of a deck that simply has no answer to another type of deck, especially when it is a popular archetype.   Considering that some of the most popular deck types can force your hand (fastro, Butchershop, HBFA, and anything else that can move in a hurry when needed), how do you cope with the fact that you take as long as you do to get set up?"
Netrunner,3bg3xf,zagzagal,1 point,Mon Jun 29 19:40:37 2015 UTC,"Getting Woman in the Red Dress out early is key against fast decks. I used Underworld Contacts and the Supplier, so slotting a couple Hostage made getting her out much easier.   I ran 3 Overmind and 3 (1 copy each) of extremely efficient breakers, so if I absolutely needed in a server Overmind would have to do (usually with an Inside Job to skip a piece of ice).  I would mulligan for WitRD and get her in play early and then do what I could to clear out the agendas already in hand.  Once you were relatively sure they no longer had agendas in hand WitRD allowed you to see when they pulled new ones or any additional combo pieces (biotics, fast track, etc).    In most fast games if it works out decently well you can stop a lot of the FA tricks before they start by just being decently aggressive before shifting into high gear build mode.  The others you can usually keep pace and steal agendas from them at the same rate.  I wasn't convinced of WitRD until this deck, but she is really good in a slow criminal build, especially with HQ Interface.  Since she activates on your turn, if they pull an Astro or other 3/2 agenda you can just hit the server it lands in (HQ or RnD) first before they have a chance to score it out themselves."
Netrunner,3bg3xf,catsails,2,Mon Jun 29 20:51:17 2015 UTC,"I'm hoping that the tipping point to make cloud breakers good is the upcoming Data and Destiny runner Sunny Lebeau - who starts with 2 link automatically making the cloud breakers ""on"".  Without having to worry about finding the critical second link, the cloud breakers and underworld contacts stand to be stronger than ever."
Netrunner,3bg3xf,PanzerD,2,Mon Jun 29 16:10:30 2015 UTC,"I like this idea too, but I think it will be important to see what other cards will accompany her. The two link makes it seem obvious that these breakers + UC would pair well, but to bring the full cloud suite is a whopping 18 influence. Even with a bloated 25 for use, if you're going to spend that much influence importing these, they better be effective! You could be bringing a lot of different cards in their place."
Netrunner,3bg3xf,Berrr,1 point,Mon Jun 29 19:43:21 2015 UTC,....Crescentus? That's about all I can come up with.
Netrunner,3bg3xf,Bwob,2,Sun Jun 28 23:22:00 2015 UTC,I went full jank and am using Savoir-Faire to spot install Crescentus and Copycat if I can use them. Drawing cards off ice rezzed with Collective Consciousness is really good. It once got me a topdecked Zu.13 when I used my only Crowbar on a previous run and Savoir-Faire let me install it immediately. I think I'm going to stick with Collective Consciousness when Geist hits since I can be aggressive and draw cards for it instead of only running through the deck when I'm trashing things.
Netrunner,3bg3xf,plopplopplopz,1 point,Mon Jun 29 16:39:47 2015 UTC,"This is the one cards that stands out to me the most in regards to synergy with our new spoiled Criminal friend, but it seems counter to the idea of actually using the cloud breakers. To use Crescentus effectively, we have to run and break ice, and ideally often enough to not simply be a nuisance to the corp. If we use the cloud breakers to do this, we need a bunch of them in the first place, and then they're gone!   Maybe the corp is now too broke to score and defend themselves, but with the money corps have these days (and Account Siphon not being the crippling weapon it used to be), I'm inclined to say that this won't break very many corps. Economic attacks like this need consistent pressure to be effective, and the cloud breakers are antithetical to that. I'm thinking that the cloud breakers can only be supplementary to this strategy - but then, card slots? Are we trying to do too much in one deck now? I'm not sure."
Netrunner,3bg3xf,plopplopplopz,1 point,Mon Jun 29 00:11:38 2015 UTC,I'm going to try to pair the  211 breaker suite with the central only suite. Hopefully when I do eventually run a remote it's because I used the recently spoiled Criminal event to exposed an agenda. Am I skeptical? You bet. I'm fearful that setting up the rig will be time consuming. Hopefully the new ID's ability will work well with autoscripter to speed up setup time.

Data Raven works great with DRT. SEA Source is great for turning on Scorched Earth. You're going to be delving heavily into both Weyland and NBN for all of those cards, so just pick the faction that has more cards you want. I prefer Weyland to NBN out of the core set, but it is your choice."

Weyland does have some means of tagging the runner, but none are as consistent as NBN (Data Raven from the core, as well as Midseasons tend to keep the team active).  Another card that is a must with DRT is SNARE!, as it can win the game outright.  The best use of DRT I have seen so far is the N.E.A.R.P.A.D. (NBN) deck, as well as an RP deck that put data ravens on centrals."
Netrunner,3bg2pp,Majickrat,1 point,Mon Jun 29 01:00:05 2015 UTC,You'll need to beg/borrow/steal a third scorch.  That gives the deck far more consistency.  Run lots of money to make sure you can actually stick tags.  And Snares.

Netrunner,3bfy3s,z4ck38,1 point,Sun Jun 28 22:02:17 2015 UTC,"My friend has this one, which I think is great and am planning on getting myself.  This looks very similar.  They're very useful for organizing by faction, and it's nice to have everything in one box.  Right now, every netrunner card will fit in the core set box."
Netrunner,3bfy3s,VizardpointO,1 point,Mon Jun 29 03:59:43 2015 UTC,"I have bought it and...  It's ok.   The cards fit very well, but some of the inserts are a bit rough to fit in. Some seem to be ever so slightly wider then others, and have to be put in a bit harder handed. Others fit seamlessly.   However, the two center insert slot rows are shared between the middle and outer card rows, which makes fitting everything in right a bit awkward at times.   My biggest gripe, however, is that the insert did not fit into the base of my core set box. I first thought it was just a very tight fit, but broke my core set base box in the process. Luckily I have three :P.  The lid of the core set box fits over it very nicely though, so I just use it that way.   All in  all its a working insert, but did not fit into the core set base box as advertised.   Edit: If you'd want md to, I could take pictures for you of the insert in action?"

Netrunner,3bfy3s,Mo0man,1 point,Mon Jun 29 10:48:37 2015 UTC,It's possible its meant for use as a replacement for the core set box. If you put the lid on top no one will be the wiser  Note: I don't use the product. I went from multiple 400 count cardboard boxes to binders
Netrunner,3bfm2h,noisex,8,Sun Jun 28 20:08:53 2015 UTC,This article is a really great resource that helped me understand basic Netrunner deckbuilding and strategy when I was just starting. Hope this helps and welcome to the game.
Netrunner,3bfm2h,hellolion,2,Sun Jun 28 21:27:13 2015 UTC,Netrunnerdb lets you deck build with a limited card pool effectively. You just have to turn on the filters. It's helped me immensely.
Netrunner,3bfm2h,152515,2,Sun Jun 28 20:52:56 2015 UTC,"That is a SUPER broad question. I am also a new player, and I can tell you what I have kind of discovered in my games so far.   Corp strategies are, very broadly:   Build up a very strong ICE remote server and use that to try and score out agendas.    Set out traps on weakly defended remote servers to cause damage to your opponent.    Use low point but quickly advanced agendas and cards that help give you extra advancement/clicks to drop and score in the same turn, negating the need for much ICE at all.    Use damaging cards to try and flatline your opponent (punitive, snare, scorch, ICE that does meat/net/brain damage), etc.     On the runner side:   You have to play a strange combination of reactionary and proactive. You have to react to what type of game your opponent is playing but at the same time, you have to do your best to throw them off that. What that means often is running early to try and drain their economy by forcing them to rez ICE before they are ready.    You usually want to also be building up your own economy engine and building up your rig, which will help you get through the ICE that your opponent is going to be trying to thwart you with.  Each of the factions will have different ways of doing this.    Criminals will build up a very strong economy engine of their own of actual credits and try to use misdirection on what they are actually trying to do, hitting one server but accessing another, breaking through ICE by avoiding it etc.    Anarchs will try and get your stuff in the archives and then run there. They seem, to me, at least to be the most interactive with the opponent, playing off of the cards that your opponent plays. Other than Noise, that is, that can kind of play solitaire for most of the game until his ""glory run"".  Shapers build up their own rigs very quickly and efficiently and have access a lot of different recurrent credits, so while they won't have the raw number of actual credits that criminal will, for instance, on a run it can seem like it. However, they suffer the most if the corp figures a way to destroy their toys (although they have great tutors and recursion).    Again, this is just the huge overview from another new player and I sure that there are more nuances that I am missing, but that is just how it has seemed to me in my games.  edit: and as mentioned, you can use netrunnerdb to filter just those card sets you have when building and kind of keep in mind the broad strategy you want to go for when building. Something that can help is find a deck you like on netrunnerdb, copy it to your private deck list and then modify it there, filtering for the cards you own."

Netrunner,3ben03,shammieg,3,Sun Jun 28 14:56:32 2015 UTC,"Hi guys, I was co-commentating with Shomar in the videos. We welcome your feedback so please drop us a comment or pm about the match videos.  We tried to stay on top of credit counts more often this time around, but we still forget to fully explain cards though. Still working on that!   During Game 1 (Engineering the Future vs Hayley), at around 32 minutes, Sungho did install a new remote that's just out of the camera frame. It was another IT Department that was never rezzed or given counters, and Maria ran it and trashed it which is why we were confused that she spent money at that point ($6 to $2). Our bad for missing it."
Netrunner,3bf3u2,GodotIsWaiting4U,8,Sun Jun 28 17:34:27 2015 UTC,"In decks with traps like Jinteki PE, you can unprotect basically anything, including 3 advancement agendas, and the runner could ignore it in fear of a trap.  Similarly, NEH can install enough high trash cost cards that you can normally unprotect, like Daily Business Show, PAD Campaign, Marked Accounts, Jackson Howard, and SanSan City Grid, that you can sneak an agenda by unprotected because checking every remote is usually too time consuming for the runner.  Some assets, like Adonis Campaign and Eve Campaign, are best protected once rezzed, but not necessary to always protect when unrezzed, before you sink a lot of money into their rez costs. In these cases, you can install unprotected if you're okay with them trashing it, and if they don't, you can rez it and protect it the next turn. This is a good way to ensure you collect your EtF install bonus every turn, and it also can reveal better ICE options as you draw cards on the following turn."
Netrunner,3bf3u2,Calc3,2,Sun Jun 28 19:49:57 2015 UTC,"Yes, you can wait until the start of your turn (well, maybe technically just before that depending on how you look at it) to rez it and get the income from it.  Part of it is just making the runner waste clicks figuring out what it is.  I'm still relatively new, but as the corp I feel the less the runner knows about what I'm doing the better."
Netrunner,3bf3u2,wpcolorado,2,Sun Jun 28 17:42:52 2015 UTC,It does not depend on how you look at it. You rez it before your turn begins.
Netrunner,3bf3u2,Bsq,1 point,Mon Jun 29 10:21:26 2015 UTC,"No. There is a rezzing window at the start of your turn before ""at the start of your turn"" effects happen. This can be important for ""once per turn"" effects."

Netrunner,3bf3u2,Bsq,1 point,Mon Jun 29 10:57:16 2015 UTC,"But if you rez a card with an ""at the start of your turn"" effect during that time, it wont trigger that turn."
Netrunner,3bf3u2,The__Inspector,4,Mon Jun 29 13:15:33 2015 UTC,"No. If you rez a card with an ""at the start of your turn"" effect during step 1.1 then it can do an ""at the start of your turn"" effect during step 1.2.  The runner can do the same. For example, imagine if a runner has two Parasites in hand and Savoir-faire installed. The runner could install one Parasite with Savoir-faire during 3.3 of the corp's turn, then install the second Parasite with Savoir-faire during 1.1 of the runner's turn, then gain one virus counter on each Parasite during 1.2 of the runner's turn.  It is only if you install or rez cards during 1.2 that start of turn effects are too late to trigger."
Netrunner,3bf3u2,Lowsow,1 point,Mon Jun 29 13:32:48 2015 UTC,Oh I see. I usually just rez at the end of the previous players turn so I was unaware. Thanks

Netrunner,3bf3u2,brainof7,1 point,Mon Jun 29 00:23:36 2015 UTC,"It depends on the matchup a lot, Whizzard is really popular right now just because there are so many good high trash cost assets that people have been leaving around undefended for so long (Daily Business Show, SanSan city grid, Blacklist, Sundew, Mental Health Clinic to name a few). A lot of people will put single ""hate"" ice in front of some of their assets like this (Swordsman, mabye a Lotus Field if it's something that shuts down a deck like blacklist against Noise or something).   In short it's entirely situational if you ice these or not though."
Netrunner,3bf3u2,brainof7,1 point,Sun Jun 28 17:56:59 2015 UTC,"Does cheaper run-ending ice work for that too, or does it have to be nastier than that?"
Netrunner,3bf3u2,unitled,1 point,Sun Jun 28 18:06:46 2015 UTC,"it can work if you are trying to just keep your stuff around for only a small while, but I think most games generally come down to you using whatever your good ""keep out"" ice is on centrals to buy time, or on remotes to advance agendas that they don't have the right breaker out for yet.   It's hard to say just because your ice spread is generally based on your decks strategy though. The problem with having cheap ETR ice on ""value"" remotes is that it encourages the runner spending time to build his rig faster if he wants to get rid of your stuff, and generally it is harder to find scoring windows after the runner has a full rig"
Netrunner,3bf3u2,dugganEE,1 point,Sun Jun 28 18:12:59 2015 UTC,"Enhanced Login Protocols is another nice tool to make checking remotes less attractive, costs them an extra click to check the first one every turn.  I always find sheer volume of assets is good, I had a deck with something like 15 Assets, 5 Upgrades, then a bunch of agendas that could be 'never advanced'. They swiftly gave up checking everything if you're creating 2-3 new servers every turn!"
Netrunner,3bf3u2,JohnQK,1 point,Sun Jun 28 19:34:48 2015 UTC,"That's the general idea. If you rez a PAD in the window before ""start of turn"" effects happen, then it's more like you're out a credit and a click (for installing it). If the runner leaves it be, you'll net a tidy profit in a few turns, which can be downright game-changing if it happens early enough. If the runner trashes it, they're (usually) out a click and four credits. Runner economy is arguably better than corp economy, but in most matches that's a great trade.   As for icing assets, it's a judgement call. If you use a piece of taxing ice (pop-up widnow, eli 1.0), the question is, is the install and rez cost of this ice the best uses of your resources. Typically the answer is no, because ice is only worth anything when its run upon, and you could throw that same ice on a central server and have it run many times. Of course, this is turned on its head with Adonis Campaign, because the runner is almost certainly going to trash it, and you can expect that server to become empty in the near future, allowing you to install something new and get a second or third or fourth use out of that ice.   EtR ice is a different story. If you have a piece of ice that can probably keep the runner out for a turn or two, you typically want to keep that hidden until you're ready to use it to its greatest advantage: to score an agenda. You mentioned Quandry, and with the promenance of Yog.0 and its low strength, quandry is mainly good for forcing the runner to install a breaker, but once they have a breaker, they can typically get past it for 1 or 0 credits. In practice, it's really expensive to get past Quandry the first time, if it's the first code gate on the board, but the rest of the time it's garbage, you really want to score an agenda with it, or else go for beefier ice. The moral of the story to know your ice, and that'll tell you where to put them."
Netrunner,3beu0a,S4tosh1,3,Sun Jun 28 16:05:14 2015 UTC,When you score an agenda it is active.
Netrunner,3beu0a,Reverend_Ape,1 point,Sun Jun 28 16:12:52 2015 UTC,"If the runner scores it though, it is effectively blank.  (They don't get the benefits.)  It is just raw points unless it specifically says it has an effect when scored by the runner.  (Medical Breakthrough for example.)"
Netrunner,3beu0a,Bwob,3,Sun Jun 28 17:51:29 2015 UTC,The runner does not score agendas. The runner steals agendas.
Netrunner,3beu0a,RS14-2,2,Sun Jun 28 17:54:01 2015 UTC,"Technically true!  I was using ""Scores"" as a generic way to say ""placed in the runner's score area"", but you're exactly right, they have a separate term for that."
Netrunner,3beu0a,Bwob,2,Sun Jun 28 17:59:16 2015 UTC,Agendas are active (and face up) in the corp's score area and inactive (and face up) in the runner's score area.
Netrunner,3beu0a,RS14-2,2,Sun Jun 28 16:13:07 2015 UTC,"Yes, agenda abilities are active as soon as you score them unless otherwise stated on the card. Nisei e.g. you can use any time where you could use a paid ability, while PSF you can only do on your turn by spending a click."

Netrunner,3beb8n,Pricklyman,2,Sun Jun 28 12:35:41 2015 UTC,"You have a lot of ICE (19). It might be worth it to drop both of the NEXT Gold for those biotics to give you a win condition outside of Efficiency Committee, or let you score out that EC without having to advance it once and give it away. Otherwise, looks pretty solid to me!  I like how Efficiency Committee can let you Install, Advance, Reclamation Shipment from San San, and use Shipment from San San all in the same turn."
Netrunner,3beb8n,Kopiok,4,Sun Jun 28 12:55:19 2015 UTC,"Having a lot of ICE is sorta the point, but I don't disagree with the sentiment.   And NEXT Gold is a big deal - no one expects it. It's won at least 3 games on its weight alone. (Getting rid of a lone early Corroder - pretty much clinches the game. Putting a Silver over anything just becomes a game win.) Even against PPVP Kates, it either forces a Sharpshooter, or I actually land the hit. At the worst - you just don't rez the things. In summary - nah, would prefer not to cut.  And generally everyone thinks the Efficiency is a NAPD - since who runs Efficiency Committee, right? :P"
Netrunner,3beb8n,shane_ruman,1 point,Sun Jun 28 13:31:14 2015 UTC,"I was surprised by your comment about the NeXT Gold surprise.  Seems strange that anyone would be surprised by a NeXT gold.  You probably not going to rez as the first NeXT and I see any NeXT on the table, I'm pretty suspicious about a Gold being somewhere out there.  Without corporate troubleshooter or IT department I don't think they're worth it.  So many cheap answers to it -- sharpshooter, deus x, atman at 4, mimic + nre -- that justifying the 8 cost is tough even if it does pump your other next ice."
Netrunner,3beb8n,Kopiok,1 point,Mon Jun 29 16:36:14 2015 UTC,"I still think 19 is heavy. Maybe just 1 Gold and 1 Biotic Labor, then. Just as a secondary option."
Netrunner,3beb8n,Kopiok,3,Sun Jun 28 13:54:47 2015 UTC,"I'm loathe to cut Golds to be honest.   Have been chatting with a mate about the deck (he decided to make one of his own, must have been because I beat him over the head with mine today, <3 you mate) and have decided to cut an Eli and Ichi in favor of a Biotic and Troubleshooter. (Finally getting to use that sick alt art!)"
Netrunner,3beb8n,razortoy,1 point,Sun Jun 28 14:03:33 2015 UTC,"Considering you also have NEXT Silver, cutting an Eli makes sense, I'm on board. Ichi, though, I am of the opinion that Ichi 1.0 is HB's best ICE. I'd be very reluctant to go down to one of. I still think NEXT Gold is awesome when it hits, but has too high a rez cost otherwise. Therefore I would still cut one Gold or not put on the Troubleshooter. I haven't played with the deck, though, so you are more qualified to make that decision! Either way I still like the deck and like it even better with a Biotic Labor!  Troubleshooter is awesome with Gold, though, if you have the money, so that slot may very well work put for you. Looks good!"
Netrunner,3beb8n,razortoy,1 point,Sun Jun 28 14:56:29 2015 UTC,"What are your thoughts on maybe swapping out a Caprice for a Markus Batty when he's out? With the great ice subs you have the ability to resolve one of them might just straight up win you the game, and if not possible you can always just choose an etr subroutine instead. It would also let you have a caprice in one server and Markus in another and both rezzed if you were facing something that liked to run a lot of different servers.  Anyway just a thought. I'm pretty new, do it might be terrible but it was something that looked interesting to me and even frees up an influence. Granted you have to trash Markus so he'll probably work better in multiples."
Netrunner,3beb8n,Vysetron,2,Sun Jun 28 19:17:52 2015 UTC,"Markus Batty seems exceptionally strong - however he is less qualified at constantly and consistently keeping someone out. And for this deck - that's what you're looking to do.  You essentially want to get the runner in a position where they just don't even want to make runs on your Super Server anymore - because of all the BS in it. Perhaps eventually they will run - but by that point you've transitioned into FA and the only thing in there is a BS Adonis, or a Jackson, or whatever.  I think Markus Batty is going to be pretty strong - but not for this deck."
Netrunner,3bc4wg,konradhi,11,Sat Jun 27 20:31:35 2015 UTC,"I guess the thing with Exile, is that you can make a strong, pretty standard shaper deck - using all the recursion they have, and also draw cards whilst doing what you want to be doing anyway.   Geist will draw you cards, but only by building a deck around that ability. So instead of building a strong deck with good cards, you're putting in 'weaker' cards just to allow you to draw more of the same cards.  I'm not saying Geist is worse by any stretch, he's clearly untested so far. But I think just looking at the cards available to trigger abilities doesn't tell the whole story. Clone Chip, Scavenge, Test Run, Retrieval Run are really strong cards in their own right (we don't talk about Pawn). You can't say that about most of the ""trash"" cards that trigger Geist. In my opinion. But I'm biased, because Exile is my jam."
Netrunner,3bc4wg,Angedelo,3,Sat Jun 27 21:51:50 2015 UTC,"I like Geist as an idea, because he makes you play those ""weaker"" cards and have different gameplay that way which is very attractive for me as a player who just like different playstyles. If you build standard shaper deck around Exile this is not as exiting as could be.  The same is with Edward Kim/Whizzard, you could make the same anarchs decks for them and just switch ID for some different flavour of pressure. But you take Maxx or Valencia and it's whole different experience."
Netrunner,3bc4wg,Angedelo,2,Sat Jun 27 21:59:00 2015 UTC,"Totally fair. Like I said, I just have a broner for Exile.  I agree though, I like playing non-standard Exile decks. Admittedly, if you do as I suggested, and just make a standard shaper deck out of Exile. Pants. Better off with Kate every time. Give me Aesop's with Cache recursion all day :)  I'll give Geist a shot, but having played with recursion for so long I'm terrified by the prospect of trashing my breakers with no way to get them back!"
Netrunner,3bc4wg,ErikTwice,1 point,Sat Jun 27 22:06:28 2015 UTC,"I don't think Whizzard and Kim are similar in practice. If you play Whizzard, you are going to play the denial game and focus on trashing economic assets and leaving the Corp broke while Kim focuses on getting accesses because accesses are more powerful when you can trash operations."
Netrunner,3bc4wg,vampire0,1 point,Sun Jun 28 09:34:08 2015 UTC,"Yeah, those are differences between Kim and Whizzard. But mostly, you will use similar set of tools to achieve those goals.   But for example Headlock Reina or Valencia requiers much more different approach to deck building to fully take advantege of their abilities."
Netrunner,3bc4wg,AnalysisSitus,11,Sun Jun 28 09:43:34 2015 UTC,"The problem is that recursion is too strong of a mechanic. Have you noticed that C&C is really the last set to include it? They can't add more to the game in order to keep it balanced, and thus Exile will be forever doomed.  Think about it, do you really want them to print more Shaper recursion? Exile is a design mistake."
Netrunner,3bc4wg,vampire0,3,Sun Jun 28 02:25:44 2015 UTC,"One way to save (or at least help) Exile would be to print some heavily restricted recursion, like how Pawn enabled Street Chess. While Pawn alone was probably too weak, I think that if we got some otherwise useless program which installed itself from the heap whenever X happened, it would be at least a start.  All that said, I completely agree with the general point that printing a Runner which wants recursion when we can't really have more recursion is silly."
Netrunner,3bc4wg,chantc,2,Sun Jun 28 10:16:29 2015 UTC,"He was released in the same set as Clone Chip - I think they really didn't expect ""Shaper Bullshit"" when they printed them. Exile is a clear sign that they expected more recursion to exist in the game, but I think once they saw that it really hurt program trashing as a mechanic and had to back off."
Netrunner,3bc4wg,lunatic_calm,10,Sun Jun 28 15:26:12 2015 UTC,"Scavenge off the top of my head, but I agree with you ~33 to ~7 is a little concerning for the Streethawk."

Netrunner,3bc4wg,AnalysisSitus,9,Sat Jun 27 21:15:19 2015 UTC,"I have a lot of love for them, but I think at this point we can admit the Shaper IDs in C&C all had a slightly too low power level.   Kit is by far the best, and Lucas has said in an interview that in retrospect maybe her 10 influence was too low and it has made her weaker than intended.   The Professor and Exile have always been very hard to make successful. And it's hard to 'fix' Exile with new recursion cards without making Kate (eg with Parasite) even better again.  So I expect Geist is likely to be just better than Exile, by design."
Netrunner,3bc4wg,Berrr,3,Sat Jun 27 23:41:05 2015 UTC,"While I agree that Exile and Kit both are slightly underpowered, I think it's too early to say how The Professor turns out. Every new high-influence non-Shaper program is a chance for him to shine. While Exile needs more recursion to become strong, every new high-influence non-Shaper program makes The Professor stronger."
Netrunner,3bc4wg,AnalysisSitus,4,Sun Jun 28 10:11:18 2015 UTC,"Mmm. I want you to be right.  (For the record, I have actually played The Professor quite a bit, including winning a GNK with him.)  It's been a couple of years and hundreds of cards since his release already though. And with his tiny 1 influence otherwise, every new pack potentially brings a meta-defining (eg Legwork) or just solid (eg Career Fair) influence-costing event/hardware/resource that he also can't use.  I guess as long as the game is around, there is always potential for the Professor to get awesome. One day we might just see enough power programs like D4v1D to really unleash the Professor. I'm not confident, but hopeful :)"
Netrunner,3bc4wg,Hell_Puppy,2,Sun Jun 28 11:55:59 2015 UTC,"Oh, for sure. At the moment, at least, he could easily stand to have 5 influence. But one day, fellow academic!"
Netrunner,3bc4wg,pandapersona,9,Sun Jun 28 12:06:41 2015 UTC,"I would like to see a card like this;  ""♢Cupid, 3 - Shaper ••• Program, 1MU  Whenever you install Cupid, Draw a card.  [Click]: You may install this card from the Heap, paying its install cost. Use this ability only as your first click.""  This would give Exile an engine, and possibly gets a look from Hayley, but doesn't help ""Mac"" in her current form."
Netrunner,3bc4wg,Angedelo,3,Sun Jun 28 07:08:26 2015 UTC,"Instead of costing a click to install, I think what might be neat is that it triggers on a successful run either on a specific central or as an access replacement effect. Kind of like the shards except it installs the program in question from the heap. It could even go as far as printing a set of 3, one for each central. e.g. HQ gives you a credit or two on install, R&D gives you a click, and Archives draws you a card.  Forcing these cards to be in other factions means influence expenditure would help keep the power level from getting too out of control."
Netrunner,3bc4wg,Hell_Puppy,3,Sun Jun 28 18:58:39 2015 UTC,"Woah. As much as I love Exile, that card is broken. I play this deck http://netrunnerdb.com/en/decklist/20935/exile-pawnshop-scottish-regionals-2nd-place- , and with Scheherazade & Sahasrara on the board, Cupid is a free install that draws 2 cards and can be pawned to Aesop for 3 creds. Rinse. Repeat. Amazing though!  Not sure the game mechanics allow for a 'click' ability to be active when the card is in the heap either, but I like the thinking."
Netrunner,3bc4wg,EgosNest,3,Sun Jun 28 09:58:20 2015 UTC,"Please don't downvote them. They were expressing an opinion.  I still think it is okay. I had factored in Aesops and Sheherazade, but I didn't consider Sahasrara. Do you think making it cost 4 keeps it playable but makes it not OTT? Do you think that, like Prepaid Voicepad, Sahasrara is just a card that will enable stuff like this to happen?  I was considering making it MU2, which might actually be a balancing factor. What would you do to fix Cupid?"
Netrunner,3bc4wg,Asinus_Sum,2,Sun Jun 28 11:07:07 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure it counts as broken - it still costs a click, and you can only do it once per turn. It gets ""broken"" once you have all four pieces of a combo out, which isn't so easy to do. Then you can't use your Sahasrara credits for something else that turn, since you spent them drawing cards instead of bombing parasites or installing Icebreakers. And you're using 2 MU for cards that aren't going to get into any servers.  Mostly the only problem I have with the card is that it is SO specific to Exile - paying 3 credits and a click to draw a card? Who else is going to use that? Maybe if it had ""TRASH: Draw 1 card."" instead of ""when you install,"" because instant-draw is very appealing (and why Exile has any power at all).  The card I want to use with Exile is the new Shaper program in The Underway. Clone chip it at the end of your opponent's turn, and get ready for some chaos..."
Netrunner,3bc4wg,HandsomeMonkey,3,Sun Jun 28 18:07:34 2015 UTC,"Maybe worth noting that Exile's ability is a little bit stronger; it happens when you install something from the heap, so it's making something that's already good (recursion) a little bit better. Trashing something, though, is generally a negative; so Geist is making a negative  less bad. Exile's use of cards with the trash symbol is mainly incidental, because it plays well with the massive amount of recursion used; but Geist requires it - which means you're likely to shoehorn in cards that don't normally see much play.  So I mean, yeah, Exile could use a little love, but he at least has access to in-faction Clone Chip, SMAC & Levi. He's a lot freer with his influence. Geist is gonna need to do some splashing for them, though, and I have a feeling he'll be wanting them."

Netrunner,3bc4wg,12ItemsOrFewer,1 point,Sat Jun 27 22:07:10 2015 UTC,"But most of the cards that install from the heap are good -- every Shaper deck already has Clone Chips and typically either a Scavenge or two or a set of Test Runs. There may be not enough of these effects to make Exile worthwhile, but it's still a very solid base.  There are a lot more cards that trigger Geist, but they aren't as good or as standard. The only commonly used single-use card in Criminals is Faerie, which actually doesn't give Geist a card because of how it's worded. Crescentus is used in some Criminal decks and will be better in Geist decks, but that's about it. Maybe the home invasion suite is worth using, maybe Street Peddler is worth splashing, but you're paying a deckbuilding cost to do these things.  In other words, Geist has more cards he benefits from but you'll have to do a lot more creative deckbuilding to put enough cards in your deck to trigger his ability often enough to be worthwhile while also maintaining your deck's general quality."

Runner deck construction has no such rule and no such problem to be solved, so there's no runner equivalent to Jackson.  Plascrete is definitely in a lot of runner decks, and for good reason.  But there are other ways to avoid getting flatlined.  I've Had Worse, things that increase hand size, having a lot of money to beat the traces of SEA/Midseason/Punitive, and really just playing wisely.

Netrunner,3bcu7o,phoenixDI,2,Sun Jun 28 00:30:07 2015 UTC,"One important point here is the mechanism behind the way this works out. What actually happens when you Inside Job a Tollbooth is this:   You start a run. You encounter the Tollbooth. The runner's effects resolve first, so you bypass the Tollbooth. The corp's effects try to resolve, but you're already past the Tollbooth, so you are not forced to pay 3.   It goes in this order because the run takes place on the runner's turn, so the runner gets to resolve their effects before the corp does. If you somehow wind up running on the corp's turn, then the corp's effects happen first. So if you were running on the corp's turn with a Femme counter on a Tollbooth, you would pay the 3c and then pay the 1c to bypass.

Netrunner,3bcu7o,zojbo,5,Sun Jun 28 02:56:30 2015 UTC,"Actually, Inside Job is a constant ability, which resolves before conditional abilities no matter who controls them. So Nasir cannot choose to resolve his ID ability before Inside Job bypasses the ice, for instance."

Netrunner,3bcu7o,zojbo,1 point,Sun Jun 28 13:39:02 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure that's correct. By my reading of pg 21 of the rule book Inside Job is not a constant ability, it is a triggered ability (note that a triggered ability does not need to have ""when"" or ""whenever"" in its text, and the bypass is clearly an action triggered by encountering the ice, rather than something that is constantly in effect like being a code gate or having +1 strength). Therefore you can trigger Nasir's ability on an Inside Job.  As for Femme which /u/BinarySecond mentions, yes, you can use that for Nasir's benefit. Femme is 100% definitely a triggered ability and therefore the runner can use Nasir's ability first."
Netrunner,3bcu7o,Lowsow,3,Mon Jun 29 14:53:43 2015 UTC,"Nope, The runner hops over tollbooth without paying the toll. Same with Fem Fatale. If you fem a tollbooth, it takes a credit to bypass the ice without encountering it. Bypass lets you pass ICE without encountering them"
Netrunner,3bcu7o,lordwei,6,Sun Jun 28 00:38:24 2015 UTC,"Yep, lordwei is right.   But one small pedantic note, you still do encounter the ICE with Inside Job (heh, the card even says ""bypass the first ICE encountered""). It's just that the bypass effect resolves before any of the Corp's ""on encounter"" abilities do, and then the runner is past the ICE so it can't do anything anymore.  But if the Runner had other abilities that could or must trigger upon encounter ICE, those still happen. E.g. if Kit uses Inside Job/Femme on some ICE, it also uses her ID ability, so the next ICE wouldn't become a Code Gate. Difference usually doesn't matter, but it does occasionally."

Netrunner,3bb839,Xenasis,5,Sat Jun 27 20:00:07 2015 UTC,"A few things:  First off, Aurora isn't unplayable. It's just the worst-case scenario.  Sort of like Pipeline or Force of Nature:  If you want a general-purpose breaker, without spending influence, that breaks whatever type of ice your faction is worst against - that breaker will suck.  Particularly when compared to the breaker for whatever your faction is best against.  In general, you can expect it to cost on average ~2 more per ice than if you were using the ""correct"" faction's breaker.  2/3 of the breakers in the game are there to give you an interesting choice: How much influence are you willing to spend on breakers?  You can spend zero, but that's going to make one of your breakers suck a little, and one of your breakers suck a lot.  But if you have something else you really need that influence for, sometimes that's worth it.  Giving criminals a good general-purpose fracter that's on a par with Corroder (or even Lady) is not going to make the game better.

Second: I don't really understand where the idea came from that Criminals were somehow the underdogs now?   They're by far the worst of the three factions. There's absolutely no reason to play them over Kate or Anarch. They have no good matchups, and don't do anything better than Kate/Anarch.  If you still don't believe me, have a look at some recent tournament results.   Honestly it feels a little like people are getting bent out of shape about criminals just because criminal decks haven't had to adapt much in the past 9 months.   No, you're looking at it the wrong way. They can't adapt, their card pool isn't strong enough for that. They haven't had basically any good cards from any cycle that isn't Genesis. They can't adapt because the tools they're being given are jokes.  The only reason Criminals stayed relevant for so long was because the meta was perfectly suited to the Criminal playstyle. For a while, GRNDL was big with fast advance on the side, perfect! Then, NEH took over, and Criminal was absolutely the best faction to combat NEH! Perfect! Nowadays, the meta is either NEH or glacier, and Criminal isn't even the best deck to beat NEH any more thanks to Clot.  tl;dr: It looks like nothing has changed for Criminal, and their card pool certainly hasn't (for the past few years), but the meta is completely different to when they were good in the past few cycles."

Winning a GNK or a Store champ with a deck doesn't mean the deck is perfect. They're small tournaments, sometimes with player counts <20, and the best player there can usually take any deck they want and win. A lot of the tournaments you linked don't list players.  Taking a suboptimal deck to a store champs and winning with it doesn't mean the deck is optimal, nor does it mean it was a tier one deck at any given time.  As an example, I was at the GNK you linked that Dave Hoyland won, I came second with Gabe and RP. Dave was the best player in the room, and I'm certain he would have won running any card in Garrote's place. It's worth noting that this was the last tournament he took Leela which had Garrote in, afaik."

I could present an equally extreme example of Hive (12 credits when going from 0 power counters, if you were wondering). As-is, I don't think this would see any play over Corroder, which is sad because the concept and gameplay it promotes is really cool.  Criminal could really use a good breaker right now, and as-is, this is far too expensive to fit the bill.

Criminals don't have much else going for them. Anarch splashes 0 breakers, Shaper splashes 1 Mimic, whilst Criminal needs to splash all 3 breakers. A Fracter would be the best thing to give to Criminal as generally, barriers are the things that stop successful runs. I think the thematic idea of ""Criminal is a Killer faction, Anarch is a Fracter faction, and Shaper is the Decoder faction"" is little more than that, a thematic idea. Having a look at a competitive breaker suite for each faction is all you need to do, really.  As I said, this card has a cool idea behind it but isn't nearly good enough to see any serious play which is sad, because Criminal could use basically any playable card right now. Breakers would be the best as it'd mean Criminals could finally use some influence on something that isn't RDI, Parasite or breakers.  I dunno, I just don't see the point in cards that won't be played, personally. It means that you also can't make a playable card with the same mechanic in the future.

Criminals are the only faction with general-purpose killers that aren't awful.

You can use one Sharpshooter like a Sentry breaker in Shaper, but you can't use Faerie as such in Criminal.   or assuming that Switchblade is Andy only?   Far too slow for any other Criminal. Criminal don't have any decent card draw (aside from Hotel, but that's Neutral), which makes the issue a lot worse. You can play it in other decks but it's worse than importing Mimic.

Netrunner,3bcp8x,Layne_Staleys_Ghost,2,Sun Jun 28 02:27:16 2015 UTC,Presumably he's using the Hayley ability on Chameleon most of the time.
Netrunner,3bcp8x,dodgepong,4,Sun Jun 28 04:29:44 2015 UTC,"So - just to address this - I build decks the way I like them to be and then make them work; I don't net-deck. If it holds up in my meta and holds up for tournaments what more do I need? Other Haley builds doing or not doing something isn't by itself a reason my deck needs to conform.  That said, if most people do something, then there's often a reason why that's the case and it's worth considering.  I would hazard a guess that the reason to include less events and more of 'other things' is to get the most mileage out of Haley's runner ability? Thing is, especially when the rig is down, I'm routinely using Haley's ability for a 2x install as is -- it's not wasted. Further, trying to keep up with the breakneck pace of installing 2x things in a row requires the kind of funding that burst-income only can provide.  My deck's income-engine is daily casts, 3x data folding, and Armitage. Sure Gamble, Dirty Laundry, and Career Fair are there to grease the wheels and get it out reliably, efficiently, and without robbing me the ability to threaten runs with my money.  Lets look at the events themselves. 3 Diesel and 3 QT are fantastic for digging and by extension reliability. When you're dealing with bouncing chameleons and draw-3 or draw-5 abilities, playing multiple cards from hand becomes more important, so 3x Career Fair fits the bill wonderfully as it has 9 fantastic targets in the deck. Example: First click, draw 5. Second click, career-fair out a DataFold/DailyCast and click-free install a SoT/Armitage. Third Click take 2 creds, Fourth click install another card or play a burst income card. Tadaa. Drew 5, played 5, and net profit while building my rig and digging for parts. Efficiently.  3 Sure Gambles hardly needs explanation - great burst income. And as I explain in the NetrunnerDB entry, ""Note the dirty laundry. It's there because click-efficiency for running with London Library is key.""  In an earlier build of this deck I considered running 2 PPvP. In playtesting, I found the resource hit for their install not worth it, especially since they have a total of 10 viable targets and are therefore unlikely to make your money back if installed halfway through the deck. Better to go with 3x Clone Chip for safety/security."
Netrunner,3bcp8x,Kopiok,1 point,Sun Jun 28 03:08:54 2015 UTC,"Events are fine in Haley. Most people are lazer focused on maximizing the value proposition of her ability by including as many 2x installable parts as they can, but she gets enough milage out of her ability even with the events. Especially if you're repeatedly using Chameleon to fuel her ability. The card type composition just has to make sense on the context of the deck as a whole."
Netrunner,3bcp8x,Rejusu,1 point,Sun Jun 28 03:22:39 2015 UTC,"Keep in mind that you can only use Hayley's ability once per turn, giving you ample opportunity to play events with your other three clicks.

Netrunner,3bbhwv,RS14-2,1 point,Sun Jun 28 02:10:40 2015 UTC,"Precognition just doesn't have much impact in my experience, and you don't have anything like Accelerated Beta Test or Mutate to take advantage of it with. Cell Portal, like all ice which needs to be on the inside of a server, is almost impossible to use because it needs to come out at a specific time and then be combined with a bunch of other ice. And then you need to keep paying for it.   I would add one more Pad Campaign. If you need more ice, I'd probably choose Hunter over Cell Portal in this deck.  Your Argus deck needs some way to punish tags, particularly if you're going to use ice like Hunter.   Archer suggests you should be using Hostile Takeover, which is much easier to score than Firmware Updates. Keep in mind that Punitive Counterstrike is weaker with 1-2 point agendas in your deck, and that 3 point agendas mean fewer chances to fire Argus's ability. SEA Source/Scorch/Scorch is usually cheaper and seems like it works better with Argus."

Some people prefer to build their deck around the burst nature of operation economy (Hedge Gamble), while others like the slow consistent engines of Armitage Codebusting/Private Contracts.    Some like a default AI breaker like Crypsis, others prefer one of each of the inefficient breakers.  There's ultimately no hard and fast rules, and the Stimhack is only a rough guideline of what to build to.  As a hard and fast rule, don't give anything super powerful to one side.  The default breakers and agendas should be not ideal, so that it will make those cards more worthwhile in the actual draft."

Netrunner,3b9uov,plopplopplopz,6,Sat Jun 27 04:12:35 2015 UTC,"Every time the runner activates a paid ability on an icebreaker which will break one or more subroutines, they it has an additional cost of +1  If they use icebreakers like Gordion Blade, Corroder, etc, then it basically costs +1 per subroutine.  On the other hand, if the runner is using something like FaerieMorning Star, they'd only pay +1 for the whole thing, when they triggered the ""break any number of subroutines"" ability.  If the runner used Lady, it would cost 1 + 1 power counter to break up to 2 subroutines.  If the runner used Yog.0, it would cost them 1 per sub instead of 0.  And it doesn't affect things that break subroutines but aren't icebreakers, so using things like E3 implants or Grappling Hook or D4v1d are unaffected.  Clicking through bioroids are also unaffected.  It's pretty brutal though, particularly for multi-sub ice.  In a lot of cases, it doubles the break-cost.  I had a NBN deck with grail ice for a while that was hilarious with this card.  Rez a Lancelot for 2 and watch the runner have to pay 6 to get through.  Good times...  It's a pretty obnoxious upgrade though.  I think the only reason you haven't seen much of it so far is because NBN isn't most peoples' first thought for glacier builds, especially with fast-advance and butchershop such strong archetypes."

I just had a bad habit of pairing it with crappy runner decks, so while I'd win nearly all my corp games with it, my poor experimental runners would just get rolled.  It worked well though, because NBN forces the runner to run fast and apply pressure so you don't sail away on an astro train, while Grail ice harshly punishes runners for running without a full breaker suite.  I built it as a primarily fast-advance deck, and mostly used the grail ice for transitioning into a glacier if I didn't win fast enough.  (Or making R&D too expensive to lock.)  I built this a while ago, (before Clot came out) so I don't know how it would do today - runners have much better ways to fight fast advance than they did when I made it.  It might still work out though, especially if you put in some Cyberdex virus suites or something.  Here's a decklist though if you're curious where I went with it!"

But the mutually exclusive regions does generate a little awkwardness sometimes.  Basically, the midways are for keeping centrals super expensive, or for trying to make a scoring server for scoring things out the old fashioned way.  The sansans are for typical NBN shenanigans, where you put them behind a single piece of ice, and wait until you draw an agenda you want to fast advance.  You can afford to be a little careless with the sansans in this deck, because License Acquisition gives you a great way to get them back.  I've had games with this deck where I ended up with 2-3 rezzed sansans, and the runner just gave up on trying to keep them trashed, (because 10c is a LOT of tempo, to go trash them) and just had to go focus on trying to see more cards from R&D than I did.  Looking back at this deck, I think I'd change a few things - probably swap a PAD campaign out for a melange, (Melanges are great for sitting in your scoring server, protected by a Midway while you look for an agenda) and probably swap an ash out for an archer.  (License Acquisition is a good thing to sacrifice to it, and an archer when you're not expecting it is one of the worst things in the world to see as a runner.  The just makes it even funnier.)  That and maybe run some anti-clot tech.  Either some Cyberdex suites, or possibly a Shipment from SanSan or two?  I haven't looked at it for a while, but I think the basic idea is probably still workable, even in today's weird and wacky environments!"
Netrunner,3b9uov,Bwob,0,Sat Jun 27 05:13:37 2015 UTC,I saw a wonderful NBN deck that ran this idea out of TWIY* - which I thought was amazingly smart.
Netrunner,3b9uov,sigma83,1 point,Sat Jun 27 06:11:07 2015 UTC,"I've tried it both ways actually!  (Although this is the first one I've posted online, so the other one definitely wasn't me.)  It's a tradeoff really.  I'm not really using the NEH ability much aside for the occasional architect hit, and TWIY's +1 hand size is great for holding grail ice.  And of course -5 max deck size is always welcome.  On the other hand, 5 influence is a big difference, and basically means the difference between being able to include fun surprises besides grail ice and not.  I think I like the influence (other factions have some way better ice for glaciering) but I think it works well either way."
Netrunner,3b9uov,Bwob,1 point,Sat Jun 27 06:37:06 2015 UTC,"Great. Thanks for the awesome reply!  I thought that's how the card worked, but wanted to confirm. I got into a small argument on jinteki.net about it. It's such a rarely used card. idk why. Decent trash cost, great ability...shrug"
Netrunner,3b9uov,Bwob,1 point,Sat Jun 27 05:05:27 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's just confusing.  It's not always obvious at first glance if it's increasing the cost by +1 per ice, or +1 per routine.  I think the biggest reason it doesn't get used much is just that it costs 4 influence, so it's hard to justify exporting it, and there is very little ice in NBN that has lots of subs.  (Although it could make for a hilarious information overload, in the right situation...)"
Netrunner,3b9uov,unitled,1 point,Sat Jun 27 05:15:13 2015 UTC,"Just a quick note... Faerie actually breaks a single sub for 0 rather than any number of subroutines (it surprised me Too) so what you've said for Yog applies there as well.  I ran it in a TWIY deck with Grail ice and it was pretty brutal, great with Licence Acquisition too to get it into play free. Once managed to catch someone out who ran with no money and a personal touched yog into a Merlin he thought he could break for free. Trashed his yog and dealt damage AND ended the run!"

If the corp has agendas in archives they are trying to protect then the runner can pass priority in the last paid ability window before accessing and if the corp doesn't use jackson, the runner will access all cards in archives but if the corp does use jackson, the runner can then pop utopia shard after jackson is done resolving to drop 2 cards from HQ into archives with the hopes of having hit an agenda in the corp's hand.   However, if there is nothing of value in archives and the runner is running to try and see 2 cards from HQ through utopia shard's ability, the corp can always delay using jackson until after the runner has committed to using the utopia shard.   This is all resolved based on how paid abilities work - the player whose turn it is gets the first opportunity to use an ability but both sides must pass priority during each paid ability window and after each ability resolves before the window closes and you move on to the next step.  Hopefully my reply is comprehensive enough to explain the situation but feel free to ask for more clarification if you're still unsure about something."
Netrunner,3b7usu,firefrenchy,1 point,Fri Jun 26 18:14:15 2015 UTC,"I think the corp more or less always wins out re: utopia shard. Unless they pop jackson unprovoked (or I guess...provoked by the run on archives) then the runner has to decide first, because you don't respond to actions in netrunner, priority happens and the active player does everything, and then the non-active player does everything, and then we move on. For example:  My opponent runs on archives. I say ""Access?"". This is me confirming that my opponent passes priority before accessing archives, which means his window to pop utopia passes if he now says ""Yes, access"". After they commit to access I can pop jackson without fear of utopia for example. If they instead say ""Pop utopia shard"" then we resolve that effect. Then again, ""Access?"" ""Yes, access"", ""Alright I use jackson"".   This is important for things like snares or psychic fields in remotes (or snares in hq if you expect the person to hit them) and their window to get a deus x to prevent damage (too late if you commit to access without fetching) and things like having drt in remotes, which you can flip after they say ""Yes, access"" if you suspect they'll hit a snare or something that inflicts a tag"
Netrunner,3b7usu,dstinct,0,Sat Jun 27 01:41:46 2015 UTC,A smart corp will never pop JH until you announce that you are using Utopia. It is always better for the corp to go after in case Untopia puts something of value in the bin.  Hades Shard is a whole other can of worms.

They will always get to shuffle in whatever they want after you pop the shard."
Netrunner,3b7usu,Dystopian_Dreamer,1 point,Sat Jun 27 22:21:04 2015 UTC,You're saying that a corp shouldn't pop J.How if the runner has a Utopia Shard on the table. I'm saying that isn't necessarily the case. If the corp already has agendas in archives he needs to pop Jackson if he doesn't want you to access those agendas on a successful run. You then have an opportunity to blow your shard to make him discard before access.
Netrunner,3b7usu,dstinct,0,Sun Jun 28 00:29:23 2015 UTC,"Nowhere in the OP did they mention agendas in archives. That is a totally different situation. I answered based upon the information given to me. Without any agendas in archives, there is absolutely no reason to pop JH before the runner fires off US. The corp will always be able to respond to a runner's actions during a run.  If there are agendas in the archives, of course the corp will be forced to shuffle them in. That isn't what the OP asked."
Netrunner,3b7usu,wynalazca,-2,Mon Jun 29 01:06:54 2015 UTC,"It appears all of these comments are kind of wrong. The order of operations is as follows:   Paid abilities window starts Player whose turn it is can use any and all paid abilities they want until they decide they are finished (runner can use US in your example) Other player can use any and all paid abilities they want until they decide they are finished (corp can use JH in your example Paid abilities window closes   There is no back and forth here. The active player uses abilities then the inactive player uses abilities. In no situation is the action allowed to go back to the active player after they ""passed"" and finished using their abilities.  Back to your example:   If the runner runs archives with a Utopia Shard out, does the corp have to commit to using Jackson Howard before the runner decides to use Utopia Shard?   No, runner goes first on the runner's turn.   To put it another way, if the corp declines to take any action, can the runner pop US, and if so, can the corp then decide to use JH?   No to both. The runner has to decide to use US first. If they pass then the corp can decide to use JH. Once the corp has passed there are no more paid abilities. To clarify what is wrong with other posters, if the runner passes, then the corp uses JH, the runner doesn't get to act again."
Netrunner,3b7usu,Krystman,-4,Sat Jun 27 02:03:00 2015 UTC,"As I understand it, Corp has to decide fist. Runner decides after all triggered ability windows, just as he is about to access. Similar to Account Siphon in this regard."

There is a paid abilities window before he decides whether or not to jack out.  After these paid abilities resolve, he decides whether or not to jack out.  Assuming he doesn't jack out, there is another paid abilities window, where the corp may rez the ice. At this point, Nasir has committed to encountering this piece of ice, but hasn't actually done so yet. His ability has not fired. This is where you want to liquidate your money on Personal Workshop, Clone Chip, SMC etc.  Nasir encounters the ICE. Any money he had is now gone, and he now has credits equal to the rez cost of the ice (including increases from Rook/Xanadu or decreases from Brain Taping Warehouse/Weyland space ice). Another paid abilities window. You are also now allowed to interact with ICE using icebreakers to break subroutines.  If there are any unbroken subroutines, they resolve in order.

But, it just occurred to me that this seems inconsistent with how I've been playing Utopia Shard (US) v Jackson Howard (JH).   Suppose it's the runner's turn. There are both a US and a JH on the board.  The runner runs on archives. Since it's the runner's turn, it's up to the runner to decide whether to use US first. If the runner chooses to use it, the corp may elect to use JH. Either way, the corp may elect to use JH. At this point, the runner has already passed on using paid abilities, and so does not have another opportunity to use US.  In the case of Nasir, it seems that at 2.3 (from the FAQ: Approached ice can be rezzed, paid abilities can be triggered, and non-ice cards can be rezzed), Nasir would choose whether to use paid abilities (to bring breakers into play, etc.), and then, the corp would decide whether or not to rez. But, Nasir waits for the corp to decide to rez before he decides what to do.  This seems contradictory. Is it?"

Phase 1 allows the active player to use any number of paid abilities. Phase 2 allows the inactive player to use any number of paid abilities.

Netrunner,3b7047,mdc273,1 point,Fri Jun 26 16:17:10 2015 UTC,Yes I believe your description is accurate. Each player uses as many activated abilities as they want before progressing to the other player. This continues until each player passes this opportunity without taking an action in sequence.  This is what makes using Clot tricky sometimes. The corp can do things like Shipment From SanSan -> rez San San Grid/use Astro Token -> score agenda from 0 advancements before the runner can respond.
Netrunner,3b7047,ltmechanicus,3,Fri Jun 26 16:28:54 2015 UTC,"Corps rez ICE in the approach phase, Nasirs ability triggers in the encounter phase. There's a paid ability window in the approach phase so you can spend all your credits there before you lose them when encountering the ICE that was just rezzed. I recommend downloading the latest FAQ document and going to the last page as that's where the run timing diagram is. Memorising your run timing windows is key to maximising Nasirs ability.  EDIT: Just to clarify you can't spend credits (that you would lose) when you encounter as Nasirs ability is a triggered one and so resolves before you reach a paid ability window. You have to do it before. It also means no using sucker counters to evaporate ICE before it triggers as datasucker can only be used on encounter."

""Be patient and money up to avoid Midseasons"" is challenged as a strategy when the Corp starts scoring out."
Netrunner,3b6qdx,dtelad11,1 point,Fri Jun 26 14:58:30 2015 UTC,"NEH Butchershop usually just autowins. But if you're up against an opponent who knows that you are a kill deck and has matchup experience and you don't open with strong econ and a Midseasons, the runner can be patient and focus on out-moneying you, then check your advanced cards once you are out-moneyed to make sure that you aren't going to Breaking News, while also having the cash to not get Midseasoned in the process.  From this position, your only chance to win is to make your agenda server taxing enough that the runner goes too low on credits to break through and bait the runner with any agenda, but your ice just isn't that taxing and you're pretty weak to Parasites, so this may not win the econ war for you. Or you could go for the Breaking News kill and hope that the runner can't find a breaker, but you don't always have Breaking News when you need it and sometimes they can get in. Or you could try to feed the runner your NAPDs or TGTBTs to hurt their econ, but this is a scenario where the runner is a good player and won't check facedown cards while poor or voluntarily steal NAPDs, so this will not work either. And sometimes the runner has a Plascrete or a similar card to make kills harder to land.  I'll score Astroscripts early whenever I get the chance or sometimes even other agendas because sometimes you play against Anarchs who trash all your kill cards or survive kills with I've Had Worse and you're forced to win through points. 1 Astro counter lets you kill with an unadvanced Breaking News and 2 Astro counters lets you Breaking News-Scorched-Scorched/Traffic Accident from hand. If you draw multiple Astroscripts you can just fast advance them all without any FA tools if you can score the first early when the runner can't steal them without getting Midseasoned. But most importantly, scoring agendas (preferably Astroscripts) early pressures the runner to play breakers and use them (and risk getting Midseasoned) in order to not lose by points or a surprise Breaking News, instead of sitting back and making money and eventually winning.  That said, I'm not sure if SanSans are the way to go because you don't want to pay 6 for it, smart runners who know you are Butchershop won't pay to trash them before they're rezzed (or at all), and Butchershop is really, really tight on deck space. But they might be worth it if you have 3 Beales because they make the scoring plan more viable.  tl;dr Midseasons can't hit good runners unless they're afraid of you winning through agenda points."

Netrunner,3b6z9r,awe_yeah,2,Fri Jun 26 14:06:06 2015 UTC,"+1 for the riffle.  7 good riffles does the trick, but it takes a good amount of time to handle that, so you might need like ten at first.  It depends on how good of a shuffle you want I guess though.   In a casual game I might slot the previously scored/stolen agendas in randomly apart, do a few lazy overhand shuffles, 3-5 riffles, a few more overhand shuffles, then offer a cut.  This isn't good enough for tournament play IMO - but I wouldn't be able to tell you what any of the agenda distribution would look like for casual purposes.  Edit:  for R&D/keyhole/Jackson stuff, in a tournamnent usually I just do around 5 riffles and a few overhand shuffles, then offer the cut...   Less riffles are okay here because your stack is smaller, so it's easier to randomize."
Netrunner,3b6z9r,12inchrecord,5,Fri Jun 26 14:15:43 2015 UTC,"As a point of order, the ""7 riffles"" rule is based on math/studies about shuffling a 52 card deck (standard playing cards). The number goes up with a larger deck, and down with a smaller deck, although in what proportions I'm not entirely sure. The point is, though, that as you're getting along through the game and your deck gets smaller, you don't need as many riffles to ""sufficiently re-randomize"" the deck.  As a further point of order, perfect or near-prefect riffles (deck split precisely in half, cards riffle 1-to-1) can actually put your deck back (or nearly back) to its original order if you do it too much. For this reason, I like throwing a couple of lazy overhands in the middle of my riffle sets as that messes up the riffle pattern so it can't just revert on itself.  Point number five (three, sir) right, point number three is to look in to mash shuffling if you sleeve your cards. It gets a similar intermixing of cards like the riffle does, but without bending the cards at all.  EDIT: others have already mentioned the video by /u/willingdone, but there is another good shuffling video on youtube from Numberphile here where it gets a bit more in to the math behind things."

Netrunner,3b6z9r,BlueSapphyre,5,Fri Jun 26 16:24:54 2015 UTC,"Thanks to all who posted my video and the Numberphile one!  The mash shuffle is my favorite. It's a bit tricky to learn, but once you get pretty good at it, it feels very fluid and is easy to do a ton of times.  The riffle is basically the same idea, just with the cards on the table instead of in your hands.  I want to quickly point out something that I mention in the video but I haven't seen discussed in this thread: pile shuffling isn't shuffling and doesn't randomize the cards. I'm not sure if that's what you mean by ""make about 10 small stacks"" /u/aepe. I want to make sure that you and others are aware that pile shuffling is not a sufficient method to randomize cards. It's actually more of a sorting/organizing process than it is a shuffle. Lots of players use pile shuffling to ""declump"" their deck, but that's either unnecessary or unintentional cheating. If you're randomizing your deck properly with the riffle or mash shuffle, then pile shuffling doesn't do anything since the whole idea of proper randomization is that it doesn't matter which order the cards begin in. If you're not doing enough mashes or riffles because ""pile shuffling counts,"" then you're likely ordering your deck without meaning to. ""Randomized"" doesn't mean ""agendas distributed evenly"" but that can easily be a result of the pile shuffle. Most pile shufflers aren't trying to cheat, but it's easy to conclude that evenly distributed agendas can be an advantage over a randomized deck.   However, that doesn't mean that the pile shuffle is without merit.  I recommend the pile shuffle in my video because it's an extremely easy way to verify that you have all of your cards in your deck. If you're playing Corp and have a 49 card deck, you'll want seven piles of seven. For Runner, I use five piles.  I wanted to point this out because there's been a lot of misinformation about the pile shuffle throughout the years. I learned the pile shuffle from other Magic players who insisted on using it to prevent clumps of mana. I've come to understand that that's essentially a form of cheating, though it's not usually the case that the perpetrator is trying to be dishonest."

Netrunner,3b6z9r,Vysetron,2,Fri Jun 26 14:08:21 2015 UTC,"using a mash or riffle shuffle seven times is enough to randomize a deck of ~50 cards, the smaller your deck the less mashes or riffles you need.  At the start of the game i recommend pile shuffling (preferably in to a number of piles that the deck divides into evenly, to make sure i have all my cards) and then i do 5 to 7 mash shuffles, then offer the cut. The reason i mash after pile shuffling is that pile shuffling by itself isnt technically randomization, but it is good to de-clump cards (like that pile of agendas you scooped up from last game)  When i'm playing shaper during the game i usually do 5 mashes followed by a quick overhand shuffle and then offer the cut.  People have already posted the willingdone video, but i'd also recommend this numberphile video that talks about the math and theory of shuffling. Shuffling and randomization is a very important part of Netrunner and indeed any card game, it's worth it to know the mechanics of it"

Going to steal Willingdone's excellent tutorial like everybody else in the thread: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnVABY_a6IQ  Do not do a ""Hindu shuffle"" or ""Overhand shuffle"", the 'normal' ways to shuffle (Hindu is normal in Asia, Overhand everywhere else afaik). It's really horrible for randomisation and barely changes order.   When starting a new game I do the 'make about 10 small stacks' way of shuffling.   This isn't a shuffle. It's an ordering, and if you organise your deck in a certain way, you could pile shuffle into a perfectly stacked/organised deck. I'm pretty sure that if you pile shuffle enough times, you get the same deck you started with, too. If someone didn't shuffle their deck other than a pile shuffle in a tournament that means something, I'd call a judge.  tl;dr: Mash shuffle or riffle. I'd argue mash shuffling is easier for sleeved cards and on top of being easy to learn, is also less likely to damage/mark your cards/sleeves, but they both work so pick your favourite. I'd always recommend mash to a beginner, though."

Netrunner,3b6z9r,PaxCecilia,2,Sun Jun 28 00:30:44 2015 UTC,"If my opponent does not shuffle their deck properly before a game, they may well be attempting to cheat. If nothing else, they are (even if unintentionally) subverting the rules of the game. It should definitely be at least a warning.  There are a few things wrong with not calling a judge here:   Not everyone will shuffle their opponents deck, notice inadequate shuffling, or tell them to shuffle more before a game. If there are, say, 6 rounds of Swiss, that means they will play 5 more rounds of Swiss with a deck that's inadequately randomised. Inadequate randomisation of a deck is not a joke and is serious cheating. Even in a perfect world where everybody shuffled their opponents deck as much as they did their own, intending to cheat is still a pretty serious offence.  The onus should be on the player whose deck it is to adequately randomise it, not their opponent. Shuffling your opponent's deck is a secondary 'backup', and should not be its primary source of randomisation.  Cheating is bad. If my opponent (intentionally or unintentionally) tried to cheat their deck into a way that affects its distribution, they should absolutely not get off scot free. My opponent should know that what they have just done is cheat and/or subvert the rules of Netrunner, even if only by accident. If they continue to cheat, they should be punished.   I refuse to act in a way that allows cheating to exist in Netrunner. If you break the rules in a serious way, you need to stop doing that or get a game loss/DQ.  If people were to act in the way you described (and if you couldn't call a judge to alert them), cheaters would never be punished for cheating, and a savvy cheater could simply let their opponent shuffle and the opponents that don't shuffle would have an unfair game."

In particular, I remember for last year's regionals we didn't know whether Lotus Field was going to be legal or not until a few days before the tournament. Kind of a big deal when the most competitive runner deck used Yog.0 as its only decoder."
Netrunner,3b3qpg,Calc3,1 point,Thu Jun 25 20:04:13 2015 UTC,"Agreed. My previous post isn't so much describing what I see as the main problem as much as undermining the idea that new card information is uniform among players.  You're definitely right that the main issue is with players not knowing which cards are going to be legal for their next tournament. The example you gave is particularly egregious. I'd really like to see some sort of schedule published at the start of the Regionals season, but I don't think that's going to happen. Using a buffer between release date and tournament legality might be a reasonable compromise.  That way, we'd be able to more accurately guess which packs are going to be legal. Of course, we'd run into some of the same problems, but there'd at least be the buffer period to prepare."
Netrunner,3b3qpg,Willingdone,3,Thu Jun 25 20:21:18 2015 UTC,That's why I just want them all to become legal on the 1st on the month.

Netrunner,3b3qpg,SiggNaturStyle,4,Fri Jun 26 08:32:17 2015 UTC,"You're not wrong. If it was true that all players were on level ground, then I'd probably agree with you.  However, it's absolutely the case that some of the members of the community know about what's coming out in future releases before the public at large due to being playtesters/knowing playtesters/talking to insiders/etc. I'd be more comfortable with some sort of buffer between release and legality to help out those ""not in the loop."""
Netrunner,3b3qpg,Willingdone,3,Thu Jun 25 19:08:31 2015 UTC,"In Magic, Wizards employees can't share information about upcoming cards nor can they attend official events. Playtesters playing in tournaments sounds like a much more serious problem than anything related to pack legality.   On sharing developmental info: I think here you should be striking at the core of the problem - the tattle-tale employees (If I remember correctly, they have taken more measures to catch leaks). Pretty sure the playtesters have signed a NDA, so catching them should be a top priority.   If you are a serious player, being out of the loop is your own problem. Everyone can proxy up upcoming cards to try them out. I think that sets should be not legal for tournament play for supply reasons and obviously there is a lot of work to be done in the policy side, but if you consider yourself a top level player, it's your job to do the homework on upcoming cards."

Netrunner,3b3qpg,Forever_Flaccid,2,Thu Jun 25 21:49:38 2015 UTC,"Nay, packs released early at GenCon aren't legal for Nationals. Last year Spaces Between was excluded from the GenCon Natls even though some people could buy it at the show."
Netrunner,3b3qpg,nelsormensch,0,Thu Jun 25 22:49:09 2015 UTC,"Fairness isn't the only consideration. A die roll is fair. Tournament players generally prefer rulesets to favor skill and preparation over variance. It's not unreasonable, then, to ban things that haven't had time to settle in the meta. I'll use Smash 4 as an example.   EVO has banned the new DLC characters from Smash4, even though the event is a month away. That up front clarity means competitors know that time spent studying the matchup with Ryu is wasted versus prepping against DK custom move sets.    Admittedly, there's also concerns that DLC characters are harder to prepare for, as their moveset and properit , and may be broken. And EVO isn't run by the people who made Smash. But it's at least a valid preference for predictable metagaming.   Translating that into A:NR territory is fairly simple. Adding cards to the meta right before a huge tournament gives advantage to unheard of decks with a hard counter, and also puts stress on players who know a hard counter to their deck is being published. Players want some time for the meta to settle down, for players to determine which counters they can leave at home and which threats they must bring to the table."

While I don't really have a problem with everyone having little time to prepare, as it's a level playing field, I would prefer it if FFG just made the sets legal on the first of the month after their release. This way, if there's a tournament on the 27th, we would know far in advance what sets would be legal, so we wouldn't waste time preparing for the wrong metagame, and we wouldn't have such a mad scramble to find the data pack in what is potentially as small as a two-day window.  Still, there is an understandable argument for ""the cards are out, so they're legal,"" but some clarity in advance about the exact release date would be nice."

It'd be one thing if they spoiled it officially to allow people SOME time to test, but if not, it's going to make people scramble AT gencon, and a lot of them won't want to bring their whole cumbersome collection with them to test/build with if they can help it."
Netrunner,3b3qpg,Willingdone,5,Thu Jun 25 23:26:21 2015 UTC,"I'm largely in agreement. I'll be attending the Chicago tournament, and I just learned that the Underway is legal from your post. It's pretty unacceptable that we have to guess/ask the TO given the fluctuation in release dates.  I had a similar issue at the Madison Regional.  I was pretty sure that Net-ready Eyes was going to be legal, but I didn't know for sure until a few days before the event.  Even as I walked in and signed up, I heard several people inquiring about the legality of the pack. Like with this Chicago tournament, the pack was released essentially the day before the tournament, though the spoilers were a bit quicker.  A Net-ready Eyes oriented build ended up getting second place at the tournament, and it would've been nice if we knew that we were up against that a little bit ahead of time.  I'd been inclined to streamline your suggestions into something like ""Data Packs are legal for tournament play two weeks after their official release date."" I don't think we're going to get FFG to agree to spoiling the cards a week before the release (though it'd be nice), so giving players a two-week buffer would help accommodate late spoilers like we have with the Underway."

You can already blow out people with an unexpected Twins in nearly every faction, I don't see why 20 new cards (most not tournament worthy) is a tournament problem in one as small as regionals.

Netrunner,3b2l0w,SmilingGak,6,Thu Jun 25 14:01:27 2015 UTC,I agree with this. I'm not really sure what they could possibly put out aside from just cloning it though. Because most other things I could think of would be inferior and people would just import Jackson.
Netrunner,3b2l0w,Ixidane,8,Thu Jun 25 14:13:38 2015 UTC,"For as much as I criticized Allele Suppression in the spoiler thread, I think it's a good example of the kind of mechanics that can be used to do the same sort of consistency management that Jackson does, and the more those cards get printed for other factions the more people will have the option to choose something other than Jackson.  It's not even necessary for the new cards to be as strong as Jackson Howard, they just need to be able to perform the function well enough that the corp has a choice: run Jackson at the cost of 3 influence, or run the in-faction card and spend the influence elsewhere. There are probably mechanics that could fit a faction's style more closely than Jackson Howard so they're less likely to be splashed in other factions. In this way I think Allele Suppression is a step in the right direction to creating cards that serve the purpose of Jackson even just a little bit (although I think the rez cost of 2 is a significant and unnecessary dampener). Until there are options for consistency management in-faction, there's no reason for non-NBN decks not to use a little influence on Jackson because it's a hole in their faction's card pool (the same way Criminals splash for breakers or Weyland splashes for code gates). Once there are more options the other corps will at least have a choice.  All this is to say I think you can get slightly worse versions of Jackson in other factions and so long as they reach a certain threshold of utility (Rework, for instance, does not reach that threshold) we'll start to see at least a bit of trailing off from Jackson.  EDIT: I also think DBS is a good example of a card doing something similar to Jackson with a different set of mechanics, but my beef with that card is it's still NBN, so the other factions are left splashing for it anyway."
Netrunner,3b2l0w,rumirumirumirumi,2,Thu Jun 25 14:30:17 2015 UTC,"I really like Allele Suppression for precisely this reason.

Netrunner,3b2l0w,SmilingGak,3,Thu Jun 25 16:10:51 2015 UTC,"I totally agree. I think all the Corps will eventually get their own versions of anti-""Agenda Flood."" We've seen some of those cards already that give us an idea of what's to come.  Shock!, Panic Button, and Corporate Shuffle came out in the same cycle as Jackson and while, obviously, barely like Jackson at all, can do some of the work you want. Shock!, as well as Shi-Kyu which will never go out of print, makes checking the Jinteki player's Archives always a risk. Panic Button, during a run on HQ, can turn a definite loss versus Legwork into a maybe-not loss. Corporate Shuffle changes up your HQ entirely.  The next cycle saw Daily Business Show - yes, another NBN asset, but also a sign of what kind of design space is being explored to counter Agenda flood. NBN, then, is good at countering Agenda Flood through card draw, between JH, DBS, and CS. An upcoming card in D&D allows for 'instant-speed' draw like Panic Button and that will probably also do some counter-flood work. Maybe you could say they are good at it through assets - important, since you could say that HB is good at it through Upgrades and ICE.  Architect came out in the same cycle as DBS. While it collapses to a Mimic, its ability to manipulate installs, and to remove a card from archives and maybe put it behind protective ICE is still an important one to think about. Looking back, HB also has Hudson 1.0 and Ash, two cards which limit accesses - maybe another theme for HB moving forward. Hudson never sees much use, but I think it will now that Breaker Bay super-servers are a thing in HB, and if you happen to have 2, one over Archives can do a lot of work versus Runners fishing for Agendas.  Jinteki now has Crick, a taxing piece of ICE that can remove an Agenda from Archives during a run. Again not perfect, since it can be paid to defeat, but it's there - and combined with Jinteki's natural affinity for ""things the runner doesn't want to see in Archives"" - can make tossing agendas in there pretty safe. EDIT: And I forgot to mention that Jinteki is the only Corp to have native self-protecting Agendas, another key counter to Agenda flood - just make the Agendas that ARE there undesirable, or unattainable.  So NBN has card draw effects. HB has ICE that can move installs around and cards that generally limit how many accesses the runner gets. Jinteki , Crick not-withstanding, says, ""you don't even want to see what's in Archives, buddy.""  Somehow I doubt Weyland will ever get that kind of card. Each faction has some faction-specific weaknesses, and maybe this will be an aspect Weyland will always have to import from other factions. Then again, with Punitive Counterstrike in their belt, maybe Weyland is the ""please, go ahead! TAKE these Agendas,"" Corp."
Netrunner,3b2l0w,EgosNest,2,Thu Jun 25 22:06:28 2015 UTC,I wish the more executives had Jacksons remove from game ability with different click abilities and then maybe increase the influence for them all.  Like Isabelle  McGuire would have been a really good candidate. She still wouldn't be as good as Jackson but HB could save on its Jackson tax.
Netrunner,3b2l0w,CoolIdeasClub,2,Thu Jun 25 14:50:11 2015 UTC,"I think the problem is that card management is an NBN theme, so most cards that handle agenda flood by moving cards around are mechanically good NBN fits.  HB has some cards like Archived Memories and Rework that are close. I feel like it wouldn't be too unreasonable to make a ""Shuffle 2 cards from archives into R&D. Draw a card"" card for HB. It's weaker than Archived Memories for recursion since you don't get the card right away, and it's weaker than Rework for HQ protection since it requires you to drop the card in Archives for a turn, but it lets you hide some cards without losing too much tempo.   Weyland got a bad way of handling flood with Glenn Station. Maybe their agenda flood mechanic could be to remove cards from the game entirely (launch the evidence into space!)? Something like ""remove X card(s) from game, trash the top Y cards from R&D"". I'd be okay with Weyland being bad at mitigating agenda flood since somehow hiding away your agendas seems not like a Weyland thing to do.  I would want to say more agendas that punish on steal could be good for Jinteki, but it seems like NBN is getting a lot of the ""on access, do X"" agendas for their new ID. Jinteki can have so many traps they can hide their agendas on the table at times, so maybe they're the best faction at embracing agenda flood."
Netrunner,3b2l0w,RogueCarpet,1 point,Thu Jun 25 18:09:06 2015 UTC,"That's right. In my opinion, the crux lies in the asymetrical game design itself. I think there must be a finer solution than printing jackson 2.0, 3.0 and 4.0 in the future of the game's life cycle for preventing agenda flood at the start. My suggestions, which aren't really thought out, involve either another mulligan system for the corp or the introduction of an additional click action for the corp ( click: put one of your cards in archives at the bottom of r&d/click: put all cards in hq on the bottom of r&d)"

Jackson Howard is a great consistency machine, and he's a good way to get agendas into and out of archives, but if you slot in a Hades Shard you basically cut out a major part of the Jackson strategy of just holding out on R&D agenda density by keeping 2 or 3 in Archives. Strong corp players will trigger Jackson to spirit away those Archives agendas earlier to avoid Hades Shard and to keep the R&D agenda density from getting too wild, but there have been plenty of tournament games when I've been able to snag a win from Archives that the corp thought was made safe from Jackson."

Before I've Had Worse was printed, I had a Custom Biotics version of Dead Coats, that would Power Shutdown into its punitives. Being able to Restructure - Punitive - Punitive, Triple Punitive, or (with jackson on the table) Punitive - Shutdown - AD into Triple Punitive was good for messing up the runner's trace maths.

We're he Neutral, you could create Corp specific consultants with 3+ influence with the understanding that they could be #4-6 with more tailored abilities.  As it stands JHow is a vital ability that is almost always a 3x in every Corp deck, right up there with hedge fund. He isn't OP, but his yellow border gives unique limitations on design."

If the designers at the time thought NBN was weaker than the other three, then making Jackson an NBN card would've been a buff to NBN or nerf to the other three factions, relative to each other.  Again, whether or not it was a good decision to make him NBN is still up for debate, but his ubiquity is not an automatic indication that he should've been neutral."

Jackson lets you not auto-lose from agenda flooding, not auto-lose from Noise/DLR/Keyhole trashing, and draw into whatever it is you need right now. I think a card will have to do at least 2 of those things before it can even be considered as a replacement."

He could be really strong at that role or very weak and he's still see play because he's one of the only cards that does what he does.  What you're really asking is ""how can we get it so we dont see jackson howard in as many decks""   I dont know exactly why you want to see him less, but are fine seeing cards like sure gamble, hedge fund, and enigma all the time, but if you really just dont like seeing Jhow that often -   The new pack coming out in under a week has drive by, which means you can snipe jackson before he can be used.  It also has cards that get stuff back from archives, so there's another alternative to jackson."

It's easy in hindsight to say this is a problem, but everyone always forgets when making an argument like this that Jackson has been around for quite some time.  It's similar to how sometimes someone that didn't play for the first two years of the game's existence will necro some thread on BGG complaining about Account Siphon and say ""noobs, it's not overpowered"".  That's forgetting that the game goes through massive changes at various stages of releases of cards.  The difference is, in the Account Siphon case, that problem has been alleviated by later Corp economy cards.  In the Jackson Howard case, the problem with his influence cost was actually caused by later releases of other strong NBN cards (NEH and DBS in particular come to mind).  To my eyes, that means we should be criticizing those cards and not Jackson, who in my opinion is just about the best example of card design I think I can point to in the whole game since he solves a problem with the basic rules (agenda flood, as others have pointed out) without having to change the rules themselves."

Netrunner,3b2l0w,aschr,1 point,Thu Jun 25 18:34:07 2015 UTC,"I would agree with you, except Lady has been printed, while no viable cards comparable to Jackson have yet to be.  And reading the context of his post, it does not convey that ""[Jackson] does something that's really important for most corp decks and for which there aren't real alternatives."" I agree with that assessment, but his post most certainly does not convey that. The first poster stated that Jackson effectively removes 3 influence from every non-NBN deck, and Restart responded with ""It only removes 3 influence from decks playing him,"" as if there's an abundance of decks that don't play Jackson, while the truth is, only fringe cases such as Supermodernism don't play Jackson. True, some decks only play two, but that's still fringe. He then made comparisons to cards that have viable alternatives (hell, in his Corroder example he even mentioned Lady and basically said ""you use influence for Corroder if you decide not to use it's only viable alternative""), not to mention that he compared taking up influence to taking up influence-free card slots, which are two completely different things.  The point is, the majority of decks are significantly worse off without Jackson, so non-NBN Corps have to save influence for Jackson, and Restart's post was completely dismissive of that point. Yes, there are fringe cases, but there are also fringe cases for Corroder (it can be argued that Inti is better in some AI decks because of Wraparound), but that's a fringe case and doesn't represent the vast majority of decks."
Netrunner,3b2l0w,RestarttGaming,2,Thu Jun 25 20:44:14 2015 UTC,"Why.  Please don't just say ""my ideas are good, yours are bad"".  Please explain.  There are some cards that do similar things to Jackson.  Anyone can play archived memories or rework.  Corroder is a dominant barrier breaker.  Before lady it was really almost the only one you ever saw.  Yes there were alternatives, just like there are alternatives to Jackson, but they were clunky expensive not quite what you wanted messes."
Netrunner,3b2l0w,aschr,3,Thu Jun 25 18:05:34 2015 UTC,"I shouldn't have to explain why Jackson is better than Archived Memories and Rework at preventing agenda flooding, but okay: Archived Memories and Rework can only remove one card from Archives, they can't be used during the runner's turn, they can't be used during a run, Archived Memories is more influence. Saying they do similar things to Jackson is like saying Aurora and Battering Ram do similar things to Corroder. And before you go and say that you used Corroder as an example, there now exists an actual viable alternative to that in Lady, while there still exists no viable alternative to Jackson. And if we're going to go with fringe cases, then I can just claim, ""Not every deck runs Corroder or Lady; some AI decks prefer Inti because of Wraparound,"" but I didn't say that, because it's a fringe case that doesn't represent the majority of decks. Enigma doesn't even compare in the slightest because a) it already has the very comparable Datapike as an alternative, and b) you're comparing spending influence points to using influence-free card slots. There's no comparison to make there; they are completely different situations.  My point is in that your response to daytodave, you weren't making a good counter-argument, you were just dismissing the fact that the vast majority of (non-NBN) Corp decks have to spare influence for Jackson."

And that card was printed in Weyland at five influence, then you would see how silly it is to say: ""If you want it, pay the influence.""

Admittedly more decks run 3 jackson than 3 enigma, but the point is - every card you put in comes at a cost somewhere else.  More econ cards means less ice and agendas.  more ice means less econ.

Netrunner,3b0m2h,SuddenlyScorched,14,Thu Jun 25 00:34:04 2015 UTC,"This is a good question. Virus counters on Hivemind are, for all card effects, considered hosted on all other viruses. Thus any effect that deals with moving or spending virus counters hosted on a particular virus card apply equally to virus counters on Hivemind. However spending and moving virus counters are two different actions, and thus Hivemind affects them differently. Virus counters that are spent can optionally be spent off of Hivemind instead of being spent off of the other virus, but, in the case of Incubator, you are required to move virus counters off of Hivemind.  Example 1: You have installed one copy of Cache with four virus counters and one copy of Hivemind with two virus counters. It is as if Cache has six virus counters. When spending virus counters off of Cache you can spend the four off of Cache, and optionally spend the two that are hosted on Hivemind. Because when spending counters on a virus card you can choose to spend any number of counters, you select which counters to spend and from where. You are not obligated to spend virus counters off of Hivemind unless you choose to (or are forced to by some card effect).  Example 2: You have installed one copy of Incubator with 5 virus counters, one copy of Hivemind with 2 virus counter and one copy each of Meduim and Nerve Agent, each with 1 virus counter. You decide to use Incubator's trash ability to move it's virus counters to Medium for a big run on R&D. Because Incubator's card text requires you to move all counters hosted on Incubator, you must move all counters on Hivemind as well, because for all card effects, they are considered to be hosted on Incubator. In this example, a much better option would be to move the virus counters from Incubator to Hivemind instead. Then you could follow up your R&D dig with a crushing multiaccess on HQ."
Netrunner,3b0m2h,GardensOfBoydstylon,14,Thu Jun 25 00:57:46 2015 UTC,"Another interesting case is with Gorman Drip v1.0.

Netrunner,3b0m2h,Rejusu,3,Thu Jun 25 08:19:24 2015 UTC,No. The reason it works with Gormon is because you don't spend or otherwise interact with the virus tokens on it. You simply gain credits equal to the number of tokens hosted on it. But since the tokens are actually hosted on Hivemind you don't lose them when you trash Gormon. Incubator is different however because it's effect is that you move all the virus tokens hosted on it. If there are ten counters hosted on Hivemind they also count as being hosted on Incubator. If you then move all the tokens on Incubator to Hivemind you still have ten tokens on Hivemind because that's all you moved.
Netrunner,3b0m2h,RestarttGaming,3,Thu Jun 25 11:03:52 2015 UTC,"Hivemind includes the text  ""Virus counters on Hivemind are considered to be hosted on all other virus programs for the purposes of card effects (and can be spent as if on them)""  You play a cache.  You can remove counters from it as normal.  You can also remove counters from Hivemind, if you wish, for the same effect (due to ""can be spent as if on them"" on hivemind).  If you trash incubator for it's ability, you will move all counters from incubator and all counters from hivemind to the new card (although theres pretty much no reason to move them to anything but hivemind, so thats kind of a moot point).  This is due to incubator moving all counters that are ""on"" incubator.  Hivemind specifically says the tokens count as ""on"" virus programs for these types of effects."
Netrunner,3b0m2h,Sunscorch,2,Thu Jun 25 00:51:33 2015 UTC,"Hivemind tokens exist on all viruses, not any. It's an important distinction.  Viruses can have their own tokens too, of course, which count just for them. Any time you spend virus tokens as a cost, you can spend them from the virus that is initiating the effect, or from Hivemind, or from both.  Spending Hivemind tokens will weaken your other viruses, usually, so it's not normally something you'd want to do. I'm sure there are plenty of strategies that do that, though."

Netrunner,3aytc0,Krystman,3,Wed Jun 24 21:54:46 2015 UTC,"I agree, plus I feel like too often the corp neglects the value of purging all virus counters as a solution to cards like Datasucker. Not only is it a default action you can always do, but there are also some useful cards that clear virus counters. Admittedly, I play casually so I don't know how Datasucker plays out in the tournament scene but amongst the people I play with it's hardly a game maker or breaker on its own, or even comboed. And if it is in a good combo that takes the runner a lot of work to set up, then what's the problem there? Good combos should be powerful."
Netrunner,3aytc0,hellolion,3,Wed Jun 24 21:47:18 2015 UTC,"takes the runner a lot of work to set up   Datasucker is very easy to use. It is just 1 credit to install. It rewards things you want to do anyway - runs on centrals. The way it just deletes ice that should be difficult to break is powerful to the point of being problematic. It is very flexible. It can be used with so many combinations - fixed breakers, AI, normal breakers, parasites etc... It requires 1 influence so you can splash it in easily. You see them used in just about every tournament deck.  Purging virus counters is a huge tempo hit. It gives the runner an additional turn. Also, it does nothing as long the runner can easily get the Datasucker tokens back. So corps will usually need to ice up centrals before they can purge. Can't do both on the same turn. And icing up is actually made more difficult if the runner also plays Parasites with Datasuckers. And they often do.  The Cyberdex virus suite came out not long ago. We see it being used more and more. It is good. But it requires deckspace, money, installs and it's not always a show-stopper for builds that rely on fixed strength breakers. More problematically, it is dead if the runner has no viruses."
Netrunner,3aytc0,Krystman,1 point,Thu Jun 25 08:25:38 2015 UTC,"Datasucker is easy to use, period, but it's hard to use effectively without a good plan and good draws, especially if the corp makes any real effort.   Again, I don't play tournaments, but I do keep up with the meta some, and I can definitely verify that datasucker is used all the time in casual decks in my scene as well. That said, I can see how datasucker is really punishing to some decks. Fast Advance and ""Standard Netrunner"" sorts of decks would seem to be prime targets, but I think both Glacier and Tag and Bag don't have a ton to worry about from it. Plus the corp has two counters they can always do (unless your deck is super low ice in which as you have just one): purge virus coutners, and ice centrals.  Purging is a tempo hit, but so are lots of responses to what the runner does. If you time it right though you can make the tempo hit worse for the runner than it is for you, especially if they have any other viruses out.  The other thing is of course making the datasucker counters cost too much. If you ice your centrals at least twice with decent ice you could get the runner to spend more on the datasucker counters than they're worth.  Also, Cyberdex may require space, money, and installs, but if virtually every deck in the tournament scene uses Datasuckers I can't see how it wouldn't be worth it to put 1 or 2 into your deck if you're feeling vulnerable to them. I haven't played with that card yet (it's actually on its way to me right now) so I'll see how useful it is in practice soon, but it seems like a good little countermeasure."
Netrunner,3aytc0,Krystman,1 point,Thu Jun 25 16:35:10 2015 UTC,"hard to use effectively without a good plan and good draws, especially if the corp makes any real effort.   That is true for any card in this game. Anything particular you struggle with?   Fast Advance and ""Standard Netrunner"" sorts of decks would seem to be prime targets   On the contrary. Fast Advance likes to play low strength ETR ice to keep runners out just long enough to score. Datasucker does little good there. It's the glacier decks where Datasucker really helps. It keeps the runs on centrals efficient even if you have to go trough strong ice. Not sure what you mean with ""Standard Netrunner"". Perhaps an example is due. Here is a Datasucker Kate utterly destroying an HB glacier. This is a good one because the runner depends a lot on suckers here, yet the corp never get to develop their boards state enough to attempt an effective purge:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2IK5CMTOtA   If you time it right though you can make the tempo hit worse for the runner than it is for you   Your are speaking hypotheticals. Before that perfect time comes the runner often has already won. From my experience, I usually welcome 3-click purges as a runner. Means I'm doing my job and the corp is struggling to keep up.   it seems like a good little countermeasure.   It is and we will probably see more of it in the future."
Netrunner,3aytc0,marimbist11,5,Thu Jun 25 22:38:58 2015 UTC,"Really love this new series. I generally agree with your observations. Here are some additional thoughts:   Demolition Run: You've been a bit down on this card. I don't think it's that bad. I think trashing ALL cards in remotes would have been too OP. Singularity has a more reasonable price point for that. And Demo Run card IS great with Medium. Sure, it's a ""win more"" card. But it can end the game when it otherwise could have been prolonged and possibly even reversed by a purge next turn. I recently used that card in Whizzard and it worked as advertised. I think perhaps making it influence 1 would make it see play in other factions. Seems like the shards took that spot now. Corroder: I think the one thing that Netrunner is struggling with is that Corroder is just too good. It is REALLY hard for FFG to develop a Barrier breaker that can compete with Corroder. It could have used a situational downside. Additionally, more influence would have made Battering Ram and Aurora more interesting out of faction. It's worth noting that the Corroder in the original Netrunner (""Hammer"") was ""Noisy"". That mechanic is no longer present in ANR. But it basically had an anti-synergy with Stealth cards. ""Noisy"" also had vulnerabilities to certain Corp cards and the runner could gain some advantages by avoiding Noisy breakers. For example, certain multi-access cards were only possible when no Noisy breakers have been used during a run. It's really sad that this wasn't adopted for ANR. Datasucker: I agree that this card turned out to be way more effective than it had any right to. Again, looking at the Netrunner CCG, the original was called ""Pattel's Virus"". You would put the virus counters directly on a piece of ice when the run was successful rather than collecting them on the Datasucker for later use. You could also only target ice that had all of its subroutines broken during that run. This sounds WAY more reasonable to me. Anarchs would need to use non-fixed breakers on their first run and use the Virus to make runs cheaper on subsequent runs. No Parasite trash on 1st encounter. No charging up on Archives either. BTW, little correction here. In order to kill a Tollbooth with Datasucker/Parasite you have to encounter it. Datasucker only works on ICE that is currently being encountered. Medium: I propose that this is somewhat mis-matched in Anarchs. It is way too good R&D access for it to be not in Shaper. It easily competes with R&D interfaces and Maker's Eye. I think something like Keyhole feels a lot more Anarch. Medium should have been at least 2MU like Keyhole is. Mimic: Again, I propose that this is WAAAAAAAY to good of a Sentry breaker in Anarchs. I would even say it's way to good for ANR period. Even disregarding Datasucker. Sentries are supposed to be expensive, remember? The Netrunner CCG version (""Codeslinger"") costs 7. Back then breakers were a bit costly, admittedly. But I think a cost of 5 or 6 would still make it playable and would make Ninja look less awful. Alternatively, Criminals should have gotten Mimic and Anarchs Ninja. Mimic makes Criminal spend influence on Sentry breakers, which I think is wrong. It also makes more reasonably priced Anarch Sentry breakers like (Cuj.0) look bad. Yog: And yes, I also think Yog should have been Shaper. But generally, I think this is also too good of a breaker for what ANR is. Again, we look at Netrunner CCG. Yog is a reprint of ""Tinweasel"". Back then, a breaker that just runs through Code Gates was ok because Code Gates were supposed to be the cheapest ICE to break - cheaper than Barriers. With ANR, it's the Barriers that are the cheapest. So Yog is out of place. The only Core Set ETR Code Gate that can't be broken with it is Tollbooth.   Anarchs are supposed to be bad at Code Gates and Sentries. Cards like Force of Nature or Cuj.0 reflect this. The core-set breakers just don't. That's why you never see the former cards in play. That's why you see Shapers splash Yog (Yogsaurus) and Criminals splash Mimic. Even if you disregard Datasucker they are just way too efficient for what the strengths of this faction should be.  Now this didn't seem that bad in the early days when Anarchs were lacking economy/card draw. It was the other factions that took these tools and ran away with them (Andisucker says hi). These days these breakers are coming back in-faction and they simply lock out a huge part of the design space. Certain ICE is ""born dead"". Certain ice breakers are never even considered."
Netrunner,3aytc0,konradhi,5,Thu Jun 25 01:25:06 2015 UTC,"A few responses:   Demo Run: I think I said a couple of different things in the video, but I'd be in favor of this card reading like this: ""Make a run. You may trash a card accessed at no cost (even if it cannot normally be trashed)."" In other words, I think it'd be better if you could trash a single card for free and could run any server.  I like your suggestion to make it one influence since that effect would be nice to import into Shaper or Criminal. Noise vs Stealth: It's sad that this mechanic was removed, but the designers seemed to think that distributing the best breakers among the three factions would somewhat replicate this effect. Unfortunately as this video discussed, the best breakers weren't actually distributed as they thought.  I think that's mainly because of the undervaluing of Datasucker + fixed strength, but it's also because the Shaper and Criminal breakers are so terrible.  It makes sense given the card pool that was printed to desire Noisy + Stealth, but if the breakers were distributed properly among the factions, that desire wouldn't be as strong.  If the Icebreakers by faction were done properly, Noisy + Stealth wouldn't be necessary. Anarch Breakers: I like some of your ideas about switching their factions, but I'd rather see the breakers that did get printed in those factions be better. The main issue with the fixed strength suite is that it's much stronger than everything else.  Datasucker is just too good. Sure, the influence thing is a huge problem, Yog.0 is more of a Shaper effect, Mimic is more of a Criminal effect,  but the main issue is that Datasucker is way too good. Fixed strength should have major issues with matching strength with 4+ stuff but Datasucker makes that trivial.  I think that both Mimic and Yog.0 would be okay if we had to use Ice Carver or Net-ready Eyes to match strength. They'd probably still need an influence fix, but without Datasucker they'd be far weaker against 5+ strength ICE. Really, if we just banned Datasucker, I think we'd go a long way to making the Icebreaker vs ICE interaction more interesting.  It's not a complete fix, but it's certainly an easy one. Parasite vs Tollbooth: Yeah, I made it sound like you didn't have to lose the three credits. That's not the case.  I think I used the word ""encounter"" in a non-technical way meaning ""have to break it"" and that's confusing since ""encounter"" is a game term. That's pretty sloppy. Oops. Keyhole vs Medium: I would've rather seen Keyhole in the Core Set than Medium, but I'm not hugely opposed to Medium.  I agree that it feels more like a Shaper effect, but I don't necessarily agree that it should be switched to Shaper because of that. Anarch isn't going to be good enough with just Archive effects, so we're going to have to make some thematic concessions.   In general, Icebreakers don't have high enough influence requirements. This isn't a problem exclusive to the Core Set, but it's most serious offenders are there. The only Icebreakers that should be one influence are those that are really narrow in use like maybe Deus X or Gingerbread.  Three should be the standard for Icebreaker influence. We should have to pay a ton of our influence if we're playing a premium rig. It's far too easy to play the best Icebreakers in the game because most of them are one or two influence.  This is most evident in the example you gave where Criminals, who are supposed to be good against Sentries, import Mimic.  It's so stupid that basically every deck plays 1x Mimic to break Architect.  There are lot of changes I'd make to the Core Set, especially within Anarch, but I'm most interested in what we can do going forward.  Banning Datasucker is the easiest way to deal with the problems we've been talking about. It's not a complete solution, but it goes a long way.  General question: how much should I talk about Original Netrunner in these videos? I've been working on the rest of the series and the impulse is to bring up a few things from the old game -- especially regarding Siphon and a few other big cards, -- but I don't want the videos to turn into a comparison of the two games.  Are folks interested in hearing about the old game? I'll probably splash it in a little bit."

Netrunner,3aytc0,Vysetron,2,Thu Jun 25 11:49:41 2015 UTC,"Datasucker and Parasite are basically cancerous. Every balance decision has had to be made with them in mind, and they still remain incredibly powerful. I'd argue they've become even stronger over time in that they continue to beat a massive amount of things. I love Netrunner, but every time a worm shows up I groan a bit. And I play the damn things."
Netrunner,3aytc0,Kivou,7,Wed Jun 24 18:33:51 2015 UTC,"They were actually totally fine before Clone Chip. It's one thing for Corp to rez a Komainu, make them lose 5 cards or pay $5 to break, and then have it die after that. It's much worse to rez a Komainu and have it instantly explode without doing anything.  That said, now the game is starting to be balanced around Parasite. For example, NEXT ICE are overpowered without the ability to destroy them before they accumulate too many."
Netrunner,3aytc0,Kivou,1 point,Wed Jun 24 19:29:44 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't say that they were ""totally fine"" before Clone Chip, though your point is absolutely correct and one that I talked about in the video. SMC and Clone Chip made Parasite a lot stronger for the reason you describe.  I don't agree that the game is balanced around Parasite, but rather that Corps must heavily metagame against it. You're right that Parasite keeps the NEXT ICE in check, but that has the effect of making the NEXT ICE mostly unplayable since Silver dies so quickly (which makes Bronze smaller and therefore easier to kill as well). Again, I look to Datasucker as a compounding problem. NEXT Gold doesn't do enough because of Datasucker + Mimic.  In my mind, an easier example of Parasite's distorting effect is with Jinteki PE. This deck struggles to compete in large part because its ICE gets completely annihilated by Parasite.  Komainu is one of the most powerful ICE for the deck, and it's really hard to justify with Clone Chip + Parasite + Datasucker everywhere.  Yagura should be a nice deterrent for R&D spam, but it's too easily destroyed.   ICE that have 0 or 1 strength are fundamentally too weak because of Parasite. That wouldn't be so bad if it was more difficult to Parasite higher strength ICE or to play Parasite out of faction. Since Datasucker is an amazing economic tool at the lowest possible influence cost, it's too easy to Parasite big stuff.  Since SMC and Clone Chip are in Shaper, it's easy to play 1x Datasucker + 1x Parasite and get an even better version of Anarch's 3x Datasucker, 3x Parasite.  If you couldn't play Datasucker, 1 strength ICE might be back on the table since you couldn't Parasite them mid-run to kill them.  You'd at least have to play Grimoire or something."

The very fact that you're installing a card into that server is what enables you to trash the installed card. So of course it's the same server. You don't trash the existing card, then install the new one. You Install a card into the server, and as part of that action, trash the existing one."
Netrunner,3az60j,PJNifty,1 point,Thu Jun 25 12:04:58 2015 UTC,"The problem comes from another ruling. Ekomind + LARLA trashes all your rig due to your memory dropping to zero midway through resolution. Since the rulebook says you remove the card in the server before the new card is installed there should (by the Ekomind ruling) be a period where the server is empty. Because of Jackson Howard rulings, we know servers vanish as soon as they are empty and unprotected."
Netrunner,3az60j,grimwalker,2,Thu Jun 25 14:31:04 2015 UTC,"I still don't think it applies. The rulebook is explicit:    When installing a card in a server, the Corporation can first trash any cards already installed in that server.   The definition of an install action dictates that it's the same server. The same condition does not exist with Levy. It says ""Shuffle your grip and heap into your stack,"" full stop. Then you draw back up.  With Jackson, the run doesn't fail as soon as he is trashed. It's effectively that when the runner moves on to the next substep of the run, the server no longer exists."
Netrunner,3az60j,PJNifty,2,Thu Jun 25 15:24:17 2015 UTC,"Right, but the FAQ is explicit and is a more recent rules doc than the rulebook.   If there are no cards installed in or protecting a remote server, then the server immediately ceases to exist. If a server ceases to exist during a run, the run immediately ends. Unless the run has passed step 4.4 of the timing structure of a run, it is not considered to be successful or unsuccessful.   Note: I am not disagreeing with the rules as they stand, simply pointing out that they are a mix of specific cases that are not a unified whole."
Netrunner,3az60j,grimwalker,2,Thu Jun 25 16:43:36 2015 UTC,"That's a better example, and you're right to correct me about Jackson howard, but I think that you're misapplying the pull quote. This is to cover instances where the contents of a server are destroyed and nothing replaces them.

Netrunner,3ay4z1,corpboy,7,Wed Jun 24 13:25:17 2015 UTC,"About half of the cards in the game see very little play. Whether you cost those cards at 1 or 4 influence makes very little difference in balancing the factions. I think the primary considerations when deciding the influence value of cards are (1) flavor, (The executives aren't all super powerful, but it makes sense that they would pretty much only work for their home company), (2) faction-uniqueness (Inside Job is a very criminal trick and is one of their special advantages. The designers felt its uniquely criminal effect should not bleed much into other factions), and (3) card balance (Biotic Labor at 2 influence would be near-autoinclude in every NBN deck).  You are somewhat correct that an abundance of powerful but low-influence cards can lead to a faction being oversplashed but underplayed. For years, Anarch was by far the worst runner faction largely because their most powerful cards were both low-influence and easily tutorable by the other two factions, (Datasucker, Parasite, Corroder, Mimic, Yog.0). This lead to a lot of Criminals and Shapers playing Anarch cards but few players playing Anarch IDs. Lukas has admitted that some of these cards influence values were mistakes; I think they have done a much better job at balancing the influence values on cards in the past couple of years, and Anarch filled a lot of its holes and got some great new IDs to boot when Order & Chaos came out.

Netrunner,3ay4z1,I_am_Mojojojo,2,Wed Jun 24 14:50:03 2015 UTC,"It's also worth noting that Jinteki is specifically supposed to be a bit ""different"" to the other three factions.  Things that get colour-swapped, don't always even arrive in Jinteki.  Eg:   Each faction has a ""trace-snake"" (Uroborous, Viper, Caduceus) but Jinteki get none. Each faction has a fast-play operation (Beanstalk Royalties, GLC, Anon Tip) but Jinteki get none. The Core-Set IDs were all about an economic advantage in their chosen sphere (Installing, Tracing, Operations) but Jinteki were something different.   Etc..."

Netrunner,3ay4z1,ErikTwice,3,Wed Jun 24 21:06:27 2015 UTC,Jinteki's equivalent of the trace snake is mamba. Jinteki almost never gets traces so their trace snake is a psi snake.
Netrunner,3aystg,lm721,2,Wed Jun 24 16:18:22 2015 UTC,Yes
Netrunner,3aystg,Imrahill,1 point,Wed Jun 24 16:22:20 2015 UTC,"Correct.  The reason for the sleeves is that they are printed through a different service, and are slightly different in appearance. If you hold one up next to a regular card, you'll see the difference in the cardstock and color print. Non-see-through sleeves are needed so decks can't be stacked in an official setting.  Of course nothing stops you from not sleeving during casual play, if you don't want to."

Netrunner,3ayc48,TheBizarreBioroid,2,Wed Jun 24 14:23:50 2015 UTC,"Been looking at it. Shame some of the prints are out of stock, because it looks like some very key cards are in them."
Netrunner,3ayc48,TheBizarreBioroid,3,Wed Jun 24 14:45:40 2015 UTC,"That is a challenge at the moment. However, the two most important packs out of print (Future Proof and Opening Moves) are supposed to back in a few months, and until then the ANRPC tournaments (large fan-run US circuit) are allowing proxies. There's a good chance your local scene will also allow them or that someone will have copies of the few key cards for you to borrow."
Netrunner,3ayc48,zombiecommand,3,Thu Jun 25 03:28:23 2015 UTC,"The starter packs are fixed distribution as well and generally just money, breakers and agendas; mostly of they type you'd probably rather not have but will get you through in a pinch."
Netrunner,3ayc48,PanzerD,1 point,Wed Jun 24 16:34:24 2015 UTC,Oh well. they were next to nothing to cost wise. Was thinking the random cards would be nice to help start. Biggest part was price.

Netrunner,3ayc48,GodotIsWaiting4U,1 point,Wed Jun 24 17:38:36 2015 UTC,The starter packs for draft are not random.  The Cyber War starter is nothing but cards you'll have plenty of in your two Core Sets.  Overdrive will provide a few new cards from later data packs that should be helpful until you expand your collection.
Netrunner,3ayc48,Xenasis,1 point,Thu Jun 25 01:53:58 2015 UTC,Oh well. i took a gamble because of price. Thought i might get some thing i would not have till i got a few  data packs.
Netrunner,3avc0a,Calc3,36,Tue Jun 23 20:15:07 2015 UTC,"Thumbs up for you guys!  For other organizers, even if you're not feeling as rebellious as these guys, consider at least allowing proxies of Jackson Howard for smaller events. While these packs have essential cards for many decks, JH is essential for all corp decks. FFG is basically preventing any new person from seriously competing in events."
Netrunner,3avc0a,flamingtominohead,4,Tue Jun 23 20:47:55 2015 UTC,"If FFG can't organise printing packs, doubt they'll have spies at official events!"
Netrunner,3avc0a,grubberlang,3,Tue Jun 23 21:00:12 2015 UTC,"They have them organized very well. They're printed in order, have been since the beginning. There were many times in GoT where people had problems waiting for a pack to return to print. It was like a year before Khazad-Dum got reprinted."
Netrunner,3avc0a,BlueSapphyre,4,Tue Jun 23 21:01:45 2015 UTC,"Very organized, just stupid for a competitive game. I guess it works for casual board games."
Netrunner,3avc0a,flamingtominohead,2,Tue Jun 23 21:04:07 2015 UTC,"The rotation schedule is part of a resolution of this. It caps the reprint schedule. Getting some of the early packs for GoT was a monster, glad it's getting rebooted."
Netrunner,3avc0a,BlueSapphyre,1 point,Tue Jun 23 21:06:49 2015 UTC,Couldn't they just... acquire more printing capability?
Netrunner,3avc0a,flamingtominohead,9,Tue Jun 23 21:11:34 2015 UTC,It's a lot like IAAing an agenda - you better be damn sure you have a window before you commit to it.
Netrunner,3avc0a,hbarSquared,7,Wed Jun 24 00:25:27 2015 UTC,Convincing a supplier to increase production capability is tricky. If a factory expands a line and then the order slacks it can be disastrous. All that capital investiture sits fallow and is possibly becoming outdated while doing nothing.
Netrunner,3avc0a,PJNifty,4,Tue Jun 23 22:56:04 2015 UTC,"You would have to talk to their printers about that. I don't know which company they go through, but currently, all the printers are slammed. Printers can't keep up with this golden era of board games, especially with all the demand generated from Kickstarters. I know PandaGM, the largest printer, halted submissions for printings because the line was so long."
Netrunner,3avc0a,BlueSapphyre,4,Tue Jun 23 21:13:50 2015 UTC,"They're expanding as fast as they can. You don't just buy a factory off the shelf, you have to negotiate agreements and confirm whoever you're buying from can produce at the required quality."
Netrunner,3avc0a,m50d,2,Tue Jun 23 21:16:09 2015 UTC,They should probably reprint based on demand rather than order of release.
Netrunner,3avc0a,Azeltir,4,Tue Jun 23 21:22:31 2015 UTC,"Because of how early you need to submit items to the printers, it's just more efficient to have everything on a set schedule when you have a catalog as large as theirs. There would be too many moving parts if you tried to do by demand, it's a relatively safe assumption that older catalog items need to be reprinted before later items."
Netrunner,3avc0a,BlueSapphyre,0,Tue Jun 23 21:25:25 2015 UTC,JH is essential for all corp decks.    That's a bit of an overstatement. There are a few decks that don't use JHow.
Netrunner,3avc0a,BlueSapphyre,11,Tue Jun 23 20:55:31 2015 UTC,"Out of the last 20 tournament-winning decklists, all but one included 3x Jackson Howard. The exception is a lone maverick Blue Sun player who included 2x Jackson Howard.  We can argue about the merits of Supermodernism and Scorched Imaging - in my opinion, the former isn't viable in a Kate-heavy meta, and the latter is outclassed by Butchershop. But at the least, we can agree that not having Opening Moves severely restricts the kinds of competitive decks you can field, and by extension, your ability to respond to the meta. It's a competitive disadvantage."
Netrunner,3avc0a,keylimetart,2,Wed Jun 24 04:21:19 2015 UTC,Two Jacksons? What a rebel!
Netrunner,3avc0a,Rejusu,-3,Wed Jun 24 10:37:42 2015 UTC,"I agree that having Jackson increases your deck consistency, but I don't agree that it's a mandatory include. I think as a collective, we've relied on him so much for so long that we haven't moved past him to explore other areas.  But I've also played a lot less netrunner since regionals, the deck building just feels stale, and been playing a lot more Star Wars."
Netrunner,3avc0a,BlueSapphyre,4,Wed Jun 24 11:35:23 2015 UTC,Lots of people have gone over the card pool many times. The top players spend weeks testing and refining their decks. If there were other areas to explore someone would have found them. As it stands nothing provides the sheer versatility of Jackson for his cost. Can you think of anything? Because I can't.
Netrunner,3avc0a,Rejusu,-1,Wed Jun 24 13:04:13 2015 UTC,"I'm not saying that Jackson isn't good, that he doesn't provide consistency. Actually, I said he does provide that. I'm just saying he's a crutch and decks can win without him."
Netrunner,3avc0a,BlueSapphyre,4,Wed Jun 24 14:25:05 2015 UTC,"The question isn't whether you can leave him out and win though, of course you can, it's a question of whether you should leave him out. And for the majority of competitive decks the answer to that is no. But if your definition of a crutch is if the deck could still win without it then you could label any card a crutch. Heck ICE is a crutch, you can win without it. You probably won't win, but you can, and that's the important bit right?  Ultimately if you could make any deck work as well as it currently does without Jackson then he wouldn't be played as often as he is. I'm sure HB, Weyland, and Jinteki would love to cut him if they could as it would free up three of their influence. But ultimately in the majority of deck archetypes he provides better consistency than any other card that could take its slot.  If you want an example of a card that's actually a crutch then look at plascrete carapace. A card that many rely on to avoid game losses but is not an auto include as there's other ways to dodge that bullet which don't require clogging your deck with cards that are dead weight against decks without meat damage."
Netrunner,3avc0a,Rejusu,-5,Wed Jun 24 14:41:01 2015 UTC,"The question isn't whether you can leave him out and win though, of course you can, it's a question of whether you should leave him out.   Exactly my point. You can win without him, so having Opening Moves not available to you shouldn't dissuade you from not playing on a competitive level."
Netrunner,3avc0a,BlueSapphyre,8,Wed Jun 24 14:46:14 2015 UTC,"Even if you're right about this, it's awful from a community-building point of view to tell new players they're shoehorned into 1 or 2 possible decks. The whole point is to make new players feel like they have the same deckbuilding opportunities as the veterans. It's about making people feel welcome, not about what's possible."
Netrunner,3avc0a,bblum,-5,Wed Jun 24 15:02:54 2015 UTC,"I suppose, personally I haven't played since regionals. And that is because this is most toxic community I've ever been a part of, can't have a contrary opinion without being witch hunted and burned at the stake. The fact that there are tournament winning decks without Jackson proves that he's not as essential as people assume."
Netrunner,3avc0a,BlueSapphyre,3,Wed Jun 24 15:08:55 2015 UTC,No it's not your point. You didn't read a word I wrote did you?
Netrunner,3avc0a,Rejusu,2,Wed Jun 24 14:49:52 2015 UTC,"Go on, then. Top some major tournaments without him. Prove your hypothesis.  I will stick with the evidence, statistical and empyrical, though."
Netrunner,3avc0a,Hell_Puppy,-1,Wed Jun 24 14:40:48 2015 UTC,Correlation doesn't not imply causation. Do the top decks have Jackson because everyone is running Jackson?
Netrunner,3avc0a,BlueSapphyre,1 point,Wed Jun 24 14:44:23 2015 UTC,"Well, if noone was running Jackson, then the top decks wouldn't have Jackson.  Good argument."

Netrunner,3avc0a,TonyStellato,9,Wed Jun 24 00:49:28 2015 UTC,This is a really good idea.  I've had several people comment on my Youtube channel that they felt discouraged to attend tournaments because they couldn't find a reasonably-priced copy of Opening Moves.
Netrunner,3avc0a,Willingdone,10,Tue Jun 23 21:49:55 2015 UTC,"I am pretty sick of seeing questions like, ""what's the best corp deck without Jackson Howard?"" How can I answer that question in good faith? I usually tell people, if they're just playing at their LGS, proxy the cards they can't get and most everyone will understand. I would certainly rather play against someone with proxied copies of Jackson than someone with a severely nerfed corp deck.  Now players looking to play in ANRPC events won't have to ask this question."
Netrunner,3avc0a,Willingdone,2,Tue Jun 23 22:21:33 2015 UTC,"I too have struggled with giving a satisfactory answer to this question. Pretty much the best I've come up with is ""try to find a friend who has extra copies.""    Major props to ANRPC for stepping up for these players."
Netrunner,3avc0a,Glitch29,2,Wed Jun 24 00:21:05 2015 UTC,"It's just too bad that ANRPC is basically making an official announcement on behalf of FFG.  I'd like the two to have a good relationship, and this could put a strain on it.  FFG seems chill enough, but setting a precedent of proxy use is messing with their livelihood.  I know it's something WotC is incredibly intolerant of, and I don't know  how far FFG will stray from those policies."
Netrunner,3avc0a,RS14-2,10,Wed Jun 24 03:11:42 2015 UTC,"Good, I'm glad you'll be doing this. However, I think you ought to require print-outs or photocopies as the proxies. At the very least, the proxy should have all necessary information.   Suppose I play Makers Eye and access Quandary, Breaking News (which I steal), and a proxy reading only ""Midseason Replacements."" I don't remember the value of the trace, but if I call a judge to ask, my opponent will figure out that they can draw into it for one click."
Netrunner,3avc0a,Amuk3,4,Tue Jun 23 23:41:14 2015 UTC,I agree. Full information on the proxy should be a requirement. It's not an issue if the print out is smaller than the sleeve and it ensures that the card text is there for a new player to read if need be.
Netrunner,3avc0a,dstinct,1 point,Wed Jun 24 15:53:07 2015 UTC,"Slips of paper in sleeves is a no go. It's too easy to bump the sleeve and expose the paper, giving the player hidden information. Blank a card with acetone and either write with sharpie or print with a laser printer."
Netrunner,3avc0a,Rejusu,6,Wed Jun 24 01:34:29 2015 UTC,"I've used proxies in casual play and I've never had this be an issue. As long as the paper is a little smaller than the card then there's no chance of it slipping out unless you're using really loose sleeves. Either way this isn't MtG, most players don't have piles of spare cards to sacrifice to making proxies."
Netrunner,3avc0a,Hell_Puppy,1 point,Wed Jun 24 10:41:14 2015 UTC,You don't have a bunch of 3-of Corp IDs that you are using a max of 1-of?
Netrunner,3avc0a,dstinct,1 point,Wed Jun 24 14:43:11 2015 UTC,"In casual it doesn't matter. This is regarding proxies being used in a tournament setting. As Hell_Puppy stated, if you are buying packs, you should have some extra IDs. You can also use extra 3-ofs if you are buying multiple core sets."
Netrunner,3avc0a,Rejusu,1 point,Wed Jun 24 16:32:24 2015 UTC,"Ultimately it comes down to how much you've bought and how many proxies you need to create as well as what you're comfortable sacrificing. Sure it shouldn't be a problem for most players, but the players it's not an issue for also probably don't have to proxy. As for IDs I actually wouldn't want to destroy more than one copy of any since I prefer to have at least one spare in case I lose or damage a copy."
Netrunner,3avc0a,rumirumirumirumi,6,Wed Jun 24 17:03:51 2015 UTC,"We're doing this for our core set tournament allowing proxies for 2-ofs and 1-ofs from the core set. These tournaments are meant to get new players to participate in competitive play without feeling like they're penalized for not making a large purchase for just a handful of cards, so using proxies in this fashion makes sense for our group. Letting players use proxies of Eli and Jackson makes perfect sense when it comes to letting dedicated players still participate fully in competitive play despite failures in FFG's supply chain.  Good on you folks."
Netrunner,3avc0a,Rejusu,6,Tue Jun 23 21:10:53 2015 UTC,"I'm okay with this but I'd really rather it was printouts only. When you're accessing off R&D as the runner it can be a problem when you see a scrawled proxy and have to decipher someone's handwriting. It can also give information away to the corp if you have to examine particular cards more than others. Plus not everyone playing will have the stats of every one of those cards memorised which will create a slowdown in play.  These aren't a problem when proxying in casual play but for tournaments I'd argue that if proxies are to be allowed then they should be clear printouts only, no handwritten cards. It's not that hard to get access to a printer after all."
Netrunner,3avc0a,Dapperghast,4,Wed Jun 24 10:24:14 2015 UTC,"Wow, honestly doubt I'll be breaking into competitive any time soon, if at all, but that's actually a pretty rad handling of the situation, well done guys (Also note that unlike most of what I say, this a rare gem not dripping with sarcasm :P)."
Netrunner,3avc0a,dy_over_dsex,2,Wed Jun 24 02:52:42 2015 UTC,"Interesting, I wish I'd have seen this earlier. I played Netrunner for the first time earlier this week, and after work today I caved and bought everything that my friendly neighborhood comic shop had in stock. It was a small enough store that I only got 1 core set and 6 data packs - but two of those data packs were Opening Moves and Future Proof! Too bad I can't proxy the other 450ish cards I need, hahaha!  At least it's not like they're getting banned or anything, though - so my purchase was probably worthwhile."
Netrunner,3avc0a,dy_over_dsex,3,Tue Jun 23 23:12:59 2015 UTC,"As long as you didn't pay a ton of money for them, you're in good shape. This rule is in effect only so long as the packs are generally unavailable, so when the reprints hit the shelves, you'd be on the hook for them anyway."
Netrunner,3avc0a,Rejusu,3,Tue Jun 23 23:25:49 2015 UTC,$15 per data pack. It sounds like I got a deal! Definitely looking forward to playing this game a lot more.

It's a temporary solution, but it really gets back to the heart of Netrunner: that we're all in this game to have fun and the community is equally fun and accepting.  The fact that they're allowing temporary proxies on official tournaments is really incredible! I'm just blown away by this. sorry, misread the OP"
Netrunner,3avc0a,azraelng,4,Wed Jun 24 15:48:19 2015 UTC,"We are not affiliated with FFG and this move is made independent of FFG. FFG had no part in this decision; it is just a decision we made for the independent circuit of ANRPC events. Clearly it's a popular move, and we encourage other TOs to follow suit and allow proxies from these sets for the time being. We would be happy to hear from FFG on the matter as well, but I wouldn't expect any official sanctioning of proxies on their part."
Netrunner,3avc0a,Delha,1 point,Wed Jun 24 16:16:35 2015 UTC,"sorry. my fault for misreading the OP. I've edited my post above, but firmly stand in the ""this is awesome"" zone for your ideas.  Considering the thought put into how the proxying would work, I think it's actually very viable. Whether FFG takes to it officially, you're right in that they probably won't, but we can always cross our fingers and hope."
Netrunner,3avc0a,azraelng,-2,Wed Jun 24 17:00:54 2015 UTC,Why limit the proxying to just those packs?  If the goal is to enable competitive play to those without the means to get ALL the cards then just allow proxies in general with TO approval.
Netrunner,3avc0a,wpcolorado,16,Tue Jun 23 22:45:22 2015 UTC,Because that incentivizes people to never buy the real cards. The policy allowing proxies from these two packs will presumably be dropped once they are readily available again.
Netrunner,3avc0a,degulasse,14,Tue Jun 23 23:03:20 2015 UTC,"A few reasons:  First and foremost, FFG does a great job of designing and producing the game, and we don't want to hurt their sales unnecessarily. I actually think this rule will help their sales in the long run, as it will help get people into the game and keep them there.  Second, it's just not ideal to be playing with proxies. They're uglier than actual cards and it's not always easy to tell what they are by looking at them from across a table.  Third, we are not looking to make the game free, we are just looking to keep its cost reasonable and the same for everyone. If we allowed all cards to be proxied, people who sunk a bunch of money into all of the cards up to this point would be on the hook for a lot more money than people who just abused the proxy rule. That is not a level playing field. In due time, these packs will be reprinted and everyone will be able to buy into the game for the same price once again. At that point, we will phase out this proxy rule."

Netrunner,3awnq9,shazzner,6,Wed Jun 24 02:35:20 2015 UTC,"btw, Wraparound still counters Chameleon because it doesn't become a Fracter, just gains the ability to break barrier subs  also, have you tested this?  as for the deck strategy, you seem to be taxing yourself quite a bit with clicks, and you only have one Autoscripter.  once it's gone, D4v1d + Overmind becomes impossible to keep going, and clicking for Kati Jones and/or Symmetrical Visage only further exacerbate things.  imo, you'll be better off with recurring credits from things like Cyberfeeder.  Data Folding is a good choice  also, with no Clone Chip, no SMC, only 2 Test Runs, and no Same Old Things, tutoring and recursion is really low for this deck tbh."
Netrunner,3awnq9,-dr00-,2,Wed Jun 24 03:39:20 2015 UTC,"My first instinct for this, or just about any green deck is to add 3 Replicator, 3 Clone Chip, 3 Akumatsu Mem Chip, 1 The Supplier, and change the ID to Hayley.  I hate myself for that."

D4v1d is a recent addition and isn't needed entirely. After missing on an R&D run, is a perfect time to draw into additional rig or gambles.  In a 40 card deck, two Test Runs was more than enough to get my breaker out and honestly I feel two is one too many."
Netrunner,3awnq9,RTsa,2,Wed Jun 24 03:52:15 2015 UTC,"I tested this idea in Edward Kim. E3 is not needed as you stated, Overmind breaks stuff for free if you have the MU. Of course in Anarch I could run Memstrips, so I had more MU in the end. You might want to do that too, since you can't have 2x Deep Red in play anyway (1 each, or memstrips x2 + astrolabe for console?). Another big thing with Anarch was that I could have 3x medium in the deck too.  One thing that I liked was Ice carver. It's basically a 4th LLDS most of the time (so might not be worth the influence, you've got Net-Ready Eyes for that slot, kinda). However, I think you'll have some problems early when you don't have the LLDS ready. I used Femmes (3x) in my deck to get in remotes (and centrals) early. By the time corp has double icing on everything neccessary you probably have built some more of the end game rig and the Femmes aren't as necessary anymore. Another thing the Femmes do, is they get around all the AI-hate ICE as well as Tollbooth and very high str ICE."

Netrunner,3awnq9,X-factor103,0,Wed Jun 24 14:48:13 2015 UTC,"The problem I have with Femme, is that you're still spending credits."
Netrunner,3awnq9,gandrasch,1 point,Thu Jun 25 03:27:18 2015 UTC,"But with Femme on LL, you can move it around every turn, allowing you to bypass Swordsman, Turing, Tollbooth (for that 3 credit tax), and Wraparound as needed."
Netrunner,3awnq9,JimTor,2,Sat Jun 27 10:40:15 2015 UTC,"Surprised no one's mentioned this combo sooner. With the upcoming release of chameleon I've been musing over the idea of a Kate/Hayley replicator LLDS deck. LL loves Femme, as stated by other replies, which doubles as an emergency bypass when needed and breaks cheap sentries.  The applications of LL are really starting to get interesting.  Also, I tested the femme/LL concept in Kit (following the Trampoline Kit post). It's very fun to include 1x Autoscripter in a Shaper deck. Those 3 influence hurt, but there are SO MANY program installs in Shaper (Test Run, playing SMC, tutoring with SMC, Scavenging to name a few). It really pulls a ton of weight, even outside of its obvious synergy with LL."

Netrunner,3awny4,Notexactlyserious,7,Wed Jun 24 02:37:20 2015 UTC,Hi! Check out the new player guide on the subreddit wiki!. Next up is the buying guide. Some of the resources are a little out of date but its a good place to start!
Netrunner,3awny4,squogfloogle,2,Wed Jun 24 02:47:28 2015 UTC,"Also, learn the game as best you can and construct some basic training decks with the core set and learn their mechanics as best you can. Then, if you don't have someone else you are learning with, go to your local FLGS and watch a few games - see if you can't entice some players to play with the decks you built. After you've observed for a bit, see if you can't get someone to let you run one of their more advanced decks - once you figure out which styles you like, you can look for those decklists on NetrunnerDB or Acoo and find the corresponding card packs. Good luck and have fun!"
Netrunner,3awny4,automatiq_jack,5,Wed Jun 24 06:03:40 2015 UTC,"A:NR tends to have a really friendly, very mature playbase, and (at least in my meta) we tend to view teaching newer players as one of those things that makes us all better in the long run. You should have a pretty easy time of finding people to help you get up to speed."

I wouldn't say it's on the level of League/Dota toxicity, but much more toxic than other competitive tabletop games I've played. If you're not a big tournament winner, no one takes you seriously.  EDIT: I'm glad I'm being downvoted for my experience, just proves how toxic this community is."
Netrunner,3awny4,BlueSapphyre,4,Wed Jun 24 14:33:22 2015 UTC,"I think if the worst case is ""nobody takes you seriously,"" it's still miles ahead of many other competitive games in terms of community. Everyone I've played with has been friendly, respectful, and gracious, such as allowing ""oops"" takebacks (""oops, I forgot to take money off Adonis"") or even actual takebacks if it's for a learning experience. I mean, I don't expect anyone to take me seriously when I'm new to a game, but I do expect them to be sportsmanlike, and I haven't heard many stories that make me think our community is anything but good in that regard.  Edit: and all that being said, I do agree that some parts of the community don't give the time of day to deck ideas that haven't won at least one tournament. I just think that's such a minor thing, I can't consider it ""toxic."""
Netrunner,3awny4,SevenCs,2,Wed Jun 24 16:34:52 2015 UTC,"I agree it's nothing like the League/Dota toxicity, but the community around MtG, GoT, Star Wars, and Conquest have been a lot more friendly to me."
Netrunner,3awny4,BlueSapphyre,4,Wed Jun 24 17:02:54 2015 UTC,"MtG? Really? Wow. I know the A:NR community likes to pick on MtG but for real, I have had some bummer experiences with the MtG players in my area. I guess I'm glad it's not like that everywhere...?"
Netrunner,3awny4,SevenCs,1 point,Wed Jun 24 17:14:56 2015 UTC,"Possibly because (at least as far as MtG goes) the player base is wider, and incorporates more players. Netrunner groups tend to be small, tend to be dominated by one or two players within it, and can be somewhat insular. If you've got a jerk sitting at the tops in your Netrunner group, you're gonna have a bad time."
Netrunner,3awny4,automatiq_jack,1 point,Thu Jun 25 14:41:12 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it could be just a percentage. Since I've played with 1000s of people in MtG over my years and had maybe a handful of bad experiences, it feels more dilute when I've only played 100s of people in ANR and had the same number of bad experience. It's the concentration."
Netrunner,3awny4,BlueSapphyre,3,Thu Jun 25 14:43:02 2015 UTC,"When it comes to competitive events, sure, the douchebag factor goes up a bit. People with more aggressive personality types are likely more interested in tournaments than casual league nights. That's a given.  As someone who played Magic for over a decade (including being TO for FNM at my LGS for a year or two), I've found Netrunner to have a relatively mature and welcoming community. In my personal experience at least, ANR draws people who are on average, much more chill than what I've seen in those met through MtG, wargaming, or RPGs."
Netrunner,3awny4,Delha,1 point,Wed Jun 24 16:57:32 2015 UTC,"I played MtG for 20 years, including being a level 1 and later a level 2 judge for numerous SE Regionals. That atmosphere was always a lot more friendly than ANR. I also play GoT, Star Wars, and Conquest, and I'd have to say that the community around ANR is the worst among them."
Netrunner,3awny4,BlueSapphyre,2,Wed Jun 24 17:00:35 2015 UTC,"What specifically is so bad?  My experience has been that the A:NR crowd is small enough that we know most of each other and are excited to get new folks involved.  We hosted a ""come and learn NR and eat pizza"" event at work to try and grow the player base here (my local group work at 2 large tech companies and we play at lunch and play weekly with the larger Fort Collins meta at a local store on Thursdays).  I've certainly not had a bad experience, but in a small player base a few assholes can ruin the whole vibe, which is unfortunate."
Netrunner,3awny4,duck_dork,1 point,Wed Jun 24 20:25:02 2015 UTC,"My time with Magic was always full of the 18-24ish crowd with ego far disproportionate to skill. I'll be honest and say that I fit in with that crowd pretty well back in the day.  These days, I play pretty much exclusively bad Johnny lists, and not once have I gotten ridicule for the terrible terrible decks I've brought to the table, be it League or Store Champs.  I guess we've just had really different experiences in both games."
Netrunner,3awny4,Delha,1 point,Wed Jun 24 17:28:27 2015 UTC,"Possibly because you're not quantifying your experience sufficiently? How widely have you played? Are you discussing just your meta or have you played enough people in areas outside your own to confidently say you have a representative sample?  For my own part, I've sampled causal playgroups from Louisiana, Texas, Michigan, Mississippi, and California, and have played numerous games on OCTGN and Jinteki (though not as much, lately) and my experience in one area seems to carry over to the next. I'm not saying there aren't assholes, but I also think the DNA of A:NR is such that it makes exploiting new players, or being outright dismissive of them, difficult.  Maybe you just need to find some people to play with who aren't asshats?"
Netrunner,3awny4,automatiq_jack,2,Thu Jun 25 14:38:07 2015 UTC,99% of my games are on OCTGN because there is no local meta here. The only chance I get to play with actual people was Store Champs and Regionals.
Netrunner,3awny4,BlueSapphyre,5,Thu Jun 25 14:41:02 2015 UTC,"Oh, yeah, the jerk count goes up on OCTGN. I've had people outright cheat, to disconnect because they decided they'd won (even though they hadn't), to attempt they'd argue that they'd won after a misplay (""Well, if I had credded up, then run your servers, I would have been able to pay through your Lancelot and then played the Notoriety I had in hand. So, I won."")  I think there, you're just dealing with the problems of life on the greater internet: Normal Person + Anonymity = Complete Fuckwad"
Netrunner,3awny4,automatiq_jack,1 point,Thu Jun 25 14:49:10 2015 UTC,"I too play primarily on OCTGN and I think there's where most of the disagreement is coming into play: sometimes the online community, especially on OCTGN, can come off rather elitist. This is not intended, nor is it recognized by the perpetrators. In person, I've had almost exclusively good experiences. In-person tournament experiences in Netrunner are pretty pleasant IMO.  On OCTGN, I've had recognizable players be extremely rude to me. I've had players accuse me of cheating when it was clearly just a misunderstanding owing to the fact that we're playing on OCTGN. I've had people rage quit. One time I rezzed an Archer that my opponent couldn't break, so I asked, ""fire?"" before I ran the subs out of politeness, and my opponent said ""what do you think?"" waited a few moments and said ""I don't have time for this"" and left the game without saying anything else. These instances were against players I've met in person and found them very agreeable.  My point is that when people play on OCTGN, they behave differently than in real life. It sucks, but it's true. Communication with text is much more prone to misinterpretation than IRL speech. This is something we all understand as heavy internet users. I share your experiences with online play, but do not necessarily agree with your conclusions. The Netrunner community is pretty pleasant overall, though it's not immune to the greater issues of playing games online.  EDIT: Either way, this thread is probably not the best place to talk about this."

Netrunner,3awny4,PostalElf,4,Wed Jun 24 10:09:28 2015 UTC,Don't buy anything yet. The core set is great and has a lot of value in it.
Netrunner,3awcyh,masymase,5,Wed Jun 24 01:02:26 2015 UTC,"Quoting the original guide (emphasis mine):   Opening Moves: [...]  Purchase Tier: This is another hard pack to classify, almost entirely due to the presence of Jackson Howard. Many people recommend this pack as a first buy due to him alone, but the rest of the packs are only moderately powerful. Still, popular opinion is that this pack belongs somewhere in Tier 1; where in that tier you purchase it is up for debate.   Howard Jackson supercharges your decks after you have the cardpool to build goods decks. Core Set + Opening Moves isn't all that great. As the guide explains, it's a very strong data pack for corp, but mediocre for Runner.  Future Proof, What Lies Ahead, and Cyber Exodus seem a lot more fun and engaging for a new player than just a set of Jackson Howard(, Celebrity Gift, and Hostage).  Update post a few months ago if you're interested"
Netrunner,3awcyh,JimTor,2,Wed Jun 24 02:46:46 2015 UTC,"Future Proof, but also because it is hard to get. So, if you can find one get it, otherwise just get some packs with cards that look fun to you."

Netrunner,3awcyh,v3ruc4,2,Wed Jun 24 08:56:32 2015 UTC,"For casual play I recommend to buy the pack in order, not too fast.  No need for a second core.

Honor and Profit and Order and Chaos are good if you like those specific factions, but I feel like there are still a good number of cards in those sets that need support from data packs.  Jackson is still really nice for Corps, but I'd just proxy him until the pack is reprinted. The rest of Opening Moves isn't exceptional compared to other packs out there."

This impacts Paper Wall, Pop-Up Window, etc.    It also has an interesting application in that a card with advancement tokens on it that hasn't been scored no longer indicates a failed trap; Exposé does something similar, as does GRNDL Refinery.

Netrunner,3aulmu,Bwob,3,Tue Jun 23 19:01:36 2015 UTC,"I don't think Drive-by will be that useful against RP, because of all the clicks you'd need. If RP is playing ELP, running a remote on the same turn as playing Drive-By is not very practical.  Playing Drive-By when it's just the upgrade there works, but then RP knows you have it, and will just rez the upgrades next time."
Netrunner,3aulmu,flamingtominohead,3,Tue Jun 23 19:12:22 2015 UTC,"Sure, but that's the point - RP likes to put the upgrades in the server BEFORE they install, so they can do things like Install-Advance-Advance their future perfect, etc.  Driveby is a card you can threaten them with even when they're not scoring.  And again, if they just rez their defensive upgrades early, then in addition to giving you a ton of information in advance, they become vulnerable to the unregistered S&W."
Netrunner,3aulmu,Bwob,5,Tue Jun 23 20:07:20 2015 UTC,"Street Peddler, Drive-By, Los Muertos Gang Members, Chameleon, Contract Killer. These are the cards we've seen so far, and they seem to be quite good. Really, Drive-By is the shining star of this data pack. I estimate Opening Moves levels of popularity here."
Netrunner,3aulmu,Darthcaboose,5,Tue Jun 23 18:45:35 2015 UTC,"Chameleon. London Library. Net Ready Eyes? I've been waiting for Chameleon for so long...  The advantage of it being nearer to the end of the cycle is that many of the support cards are already out to combo with it. So hype! (wondering if this could replace Atman in a bunch of decks for ""that useful breaker slot that's not my fracter/decoder/killer"")  Heck, is a janky LLDS processor deck in the work? Maybe??"

The only thing they didn't add to the spoilers page on BGG was the second Jinteki card in the pack.  I think that is why we haven't seen any full spoiler posts yet.

Netrunner,3aulu5,MogrimACV,12,Tue Jun 23 17:12:26 2015 UTC,"Everything is on a cycle. As the print cycle list gets longer, it takes a longer amount of time to get back around.  Study in Static is next on the list, Future Proof and Humanity's Shadow will be reprinted before Opening Moves.    On a side note, be glad you're not waiting for the Raider for X-Wing. It's felt like a year since it was announced, and will really bring TIE/x1 back into the competitive scene hopefully."
Netrunner,3aulu5,BlueSapphyre,4,Tue Jun 23 17:16:09 2015 UTC,"The owner of my FLGS had a conversation with FFG a few months ago about Opening Moves due to increasing demand, and was told differently. According to the person he spoke to, reprints are done by the cycle, not the datapack. All the cards from the whole cycle share the same sheet, and while Opening Moves was sold out, the rest of the Spin Cycle was(at the time) stocked too deep to order a reprint."
Netrunner,3aulu5,dontmindhim,2,Tue Jun 23 20:11:19 2015 UTC,"Then why would last 3 packs of the genesis cycle be awaiting reprint and not the entire cycle? From previous reprints, it's ~one pack at a time. Maybe they print them all and release them slowly? But that doesn't make sense."
Netrunner,3aulu5,BlueSapphyre,3,Tue Jun 23 20:50:03 2015 UTC,"'Awaiting Reprint' could just be a gentler way of saying 'Sold Out.' I can't say for sure. When we received the Genesis reprints earlier this year, we got the whole cycle at once, which supports what I've heard. Perhaps the manufacturing method has changed in a way that disallows pack-specific reprints."
Netrunner,3aulu5,dontmindhim,1 point,Tue Jun 23 21:16:59 2015 UTC,"Yeah, just looked back at the latest reprint influx, and maybe they split the cycle in half? We got one half in of a cycle in, and then a month later the second half."
Netrunner,3aulu5,BlueSapphyre,1 point,Tue Jun 23 21:34:08 2015 UTC,Previous reprints have never been one pack at a time. It's always the entire cycle. It has always been the case that reprinted cycles always drop all 6 packs to the distributors at the same time.
Netrunner,3aulu5,grimwalker,1 point,Wed Jun 24 04:37:08 2015 UTC,"Interesting, must have been some kind of shipping delay then that separated them."

Netrunner,3aulu5,grimwalker,3,Wed Jun 24 04:35:27 2015 UTC,"If this is the case, they're really stupid. Opening Moves should've been printed before the SanSan cycle started if FFG knew what they were doing. Newer players are going to be at very high-level tournaments while being unable to purchase arguably the most important card in the game."
Netrunner,3aulu5,wynalazca,12,Tue Jun 23 17:44:54 2015 UTC,"With so many competitive games they have in production (GoT, ANR, 40K Conquest, Star Wars, Imperial Assault, X-Wing, Armada), the printers are just overloaded with work, so it's just easier from a business standpoint to have everything on a print schedule rather than try to micromanage the entire catalog."
Netrunner,3aulu5,BlueSapphyre,2,Tue Jun 23 17:49:18 2015 UTC,"And I'm totally fine with a print schedule, as long as it's transparent and I know when to expect it.  But nobody seems to know with certainty when Opening Moves is scheduled to come back around.  That's the frustrating part.  It's all rumours.  Just post the schedule on the FFG website!"
Netrunner,3aulu5,grimwalker,2,Wed Jun 24 03:51:00 2015 UTC,"If they post the schedule, then people bitch and moan when delays happen or dates are missed. They used to do so. Then the fans ruined it for everyone."
Netrunner,3aulu5,TaquitoBandit,6,Wed Jun 24 04:34:23 2015 UTC,"FFG has a massive library of things that constantly need to be printed and re-printed, so they probably have to place their orders with the factory waaaay in advance and then are bound to that schedule regardless of the surge in demand.  The easiest way to fix the Opening Moves issue and level the playing field for newer players would be to release alt-art Jacksons."
Netrunner,3aulu5,Bwob,3,Tue Jun 23 20:30:18 2015 UTC,"What I really wish they'd do is just leverage their Print-on-demand facilities a bit more.  (The ones they use for printing draft packs and alt-art cards.)  If they'd just make a web-interface where you could buy individual cards for like $1 each, and have them mailed to you, that would solve a lot of problems.  I'm sure there are business reasons why this isn't as practical as it sounds in my head (supply chains are weird and hard, and creating and distributing product is seldom as easy as it sounds) but I'd love to be able to buy specific copies of things.  It would also solve the ""how many core sets do I need?"" problem handily as well..."
Netrunner,3aulu5,captainraffi,1 point,Tue Jun 23 21:35:59 2015 UTC,"I'd always hoped that instead of rotation they'd do ""Data Packs on Demand"" where once a data pack cycle was 2-cycles old (so Genesis right now) you could go on line and ""build your own data pack"" of 60 cards. New players can get the cards they need to jump in competitively and grognards can get the duplicates they want to have multiple decks built."

Netrunner,3aulu5,Pricklyman,2,Tue Jun 23 18:03:32 2015 UTC,"X-wing, just like any LCG, is as expensive as you want it to be. The issue is that some cards are in ships that you don't need/want. Like the Raider is MSRP $100, and has the card that ""fixes"" TIE/x1. If you don't fly TIE/x1s then you don't need the ship at all."

Netrunner,3atv2u,junkmail22,6,Tue Jun 23 13:44:45 2015 UTC,"The question I will always ask of Nasir decks is: are they any better/comparable to Solidarity? (this is El-Ad's Nasir deck with something like 50 games of testing behind it before posting).  The thing is an absolute beast. Order of Sol pulling double time for credits to, at the very least, dump into workshop. A breaker for all occassions, and D4v1d for good measure. 1x Cresentus, because making the corp rez something big TWICE in front of Nasir is just brutal. There is an answer to anything in that deck, whether it's fast runs or long game anti-glacier. And just a hint of Stimhack, for when you either need that workshop building boost or a push for scoring.  I'd strongly recommend checking out Solidarity and see if it can do anything for your deck (I can't post the link here as I'm at work). Consider it ""idea hunting""."
Netrunner,3atv2u,X-factor103,1 point,Tue Jun 23 17:40:06 2015 UTC,"The main shenanigan of my deck is Rook + Crescentus in Nasir, so that's fun  I would add D4v1d if I had the influence for it, but influence is fairly tight in this deck, and the same goes for stimhack. I also noticed he has no real HQ pressure, which is extremely important against astrobiotics.   I'm also not a fan of Order of Sol. I've played around with it before, but I feel like it just doesn't quite warrant the deckspace - getting things off of Pworkshop isn't really my problem."
Netrunner,3atv2u,X-factor103,4,Tue Jun 23 18:27:38 2015 UTC,"I suppose it's a personal call there. I've seen Order of Sol pay for itself ten times over. It's quite the workhorse out of Nasir. But if you cut it, it's totally 2-3 more deck slots freed up, and depending on your meta, if you're playing against a ton of glacier you might not miss it."
Netrunner,3atv2u,randymagnum1669,3,Tue Jun 23 18:30:57 2015 UTC,"I would never cut Order of Sol. As you said, it easily pays for itself ten times over, especially if you hit it turn 1. With personal workshop, it's disgusting. I wouldn't run less than 2. I guess it's his big disadvantage/advantage... he has PW and Order of Sol which work so well for him, but dilute his deck where other decks can pack more solid econ/tricks."
Netrunner,3atv2u,Funshade,0,Tue Jun 23 19:32:03 2015 UTC,"Yeah, my meta is mostly glacier. The deck has done well against flatline and FA decks though"
Netrunner,3atv2u,Kivou,3,Tue Jun 23 18:34:42 2015 UTC,"I play Exclusively Nasir and reach top 8 consistently. I dislike a lot of the choices made for this deck.

Netrunner,3atv2u,allemagne,0,Wed Jun 24 06:58:52 2015 UTC,"I've actually taken what people have said pretty seriously. I'm considering making space for 2x order of Sol or 1x Cyber-cypher right now, and I'll probably test those variants out. But yeah, it's way too easy to get defensive on the internet, so sorry if I came across that way"
Netrunner,3atv2u,MattyTrane,7,Wed Jun 24 12:54:45 2015 UTC,"No offense intended, but you can't just claim a deck is good without evidence.  To be constructive, it looks like you straight up lose against Astrobiotics or any deck running cheap ICE like Quandary and Wraparound. Your breakers and console are very expensive to install and the only economy you have that doesn't rely on the Corp deciding to feed you piles of money is 1x Opus and the trickle from Personal Workshop.  There's absolutely no reason for such a fast advance deck to rez any ICE that has Rook on it, they can just let you in, then overwrite Rook after you spend $2 and 2 clicks putting it there."
Netrunner,3atv2u,InHaloBlack,-1,Tue Jun 23 14:31:48 2015 UTC,"Yeah Astrobiotics can be tough without a good opening hand. But remember that if they aren't rezzing ice with Rooks on them, they're giving you free accesses. Usually that pressure is enough until you grab your Opus."
Netrunner,3atv2u,InHaloBlack,1 point,Tue Jun 23 16:09:26 2015 UTC,But that only works for one or two turns until they overwrite.
Netrunner,3atv2u,MattyTrane,1 point,Thu Jun 25 16:57:41 2015 UTC,"That's when you hopefully have another or your opus. You aren't completely crippled without a Rook, but I sucks to play against tiny ice like this."
Netrunner,3atv2u,JohnQK,2,Thu Jun 25 18:03:47 2015 UTC,There's a lot of fat to be cut here.  Nasir needs 2-3 Order of Sol.
Netrunner,3atv2u,neutronicus,0,Wed Jun 24 01:31:49 2015 UTC,I really disagree. It prevents you from effectively using plus and it's just not worth the deck space.
Netrunner,3atv2u,Rejusu,2,Wed Jun 24 02:44:14 2015 UTC,"Order of Sol was basically MADE for Nasir. Even if you ignore Personal Workshop credits, that's an extra credit every time you hit an ICE. On top of that, if you keep track of how much it makes you over the course of the game, it can make you one credit per turn - including the corp's - and will EASILY pay for itself 10-20 times over."
Netrunner,3atv2u,Rejusu,1 point,Wed Jun 24 18:20:29 2015 UTC,"The problem is that I don't really have difficulty getting things off of workshop, and I don't want to include 3 copies of a unique card."
Netrunner,3atv2u,Rejusu,1 point,Wed Jun 24 18:52:43 2015 UTC,"Don't look at it as a way to get things off PW. Look at it as a form of drip economy.   For example, you put Toolbox on PW. At the end of YOUR turn, dump your credits into it, let's say you had 3. You hit 0 credits, and gain one. The corp does its turn, at the end of the corp's turn, you pay your one, drop to 0, gain one back. You take a counter off of it for the beginning of your turn, and suddenly it's down to only 4 counters left the turn after you played it, and you still have a credit leftover.   This is just one example, but as long as you have quite literally anything on PW, it's one credit per turn, (including the corp's.) It's like a better Underworld Contact or Data Folding with no link/mem requirement. You get the added bonus of getting that extra one when you hit an ICE during a run, too, if you don't have anything on PW."
Netrunner,3atv2u,Rejusu,1 point,Thu Jun 25 02:39:50 2015 UTC,I don't know how you could argue against 1 credit per turn (on both runner and corp turn) easily Nasir's most lucrative card.    This card and its synergy with PW is the reason Nasir doesnt care about Sure Gamble.  He makes more money off of being broke.
Netrunner,3atv2u,SevenCs,2,Wed Jun 24 20:52:03 2015 UTC,You have two different barrier breakers. All of the breakers are very expensive but you have no cheese to get them out. You'll either get really lucky and draw it then let it simmer on personal workshop forever or you'll spend a turn and a half using Opus to be able to install them via Self Modifying Code.
Netrunner,3atv2u,JohnQK,10,Tue Jun 23 14:59:57 2015 UTC,Nasir's a moon man.  He's made of cheese.
Netrunner,3atv2u,SevenCs,3,Tue Jun 23 15:06:29 2015 UTC,"I played a lot of Nasir back when Upstalk came out, you can't approach him with the same mindset as other runners. Playing big rig is very viable. If they're rezzing ICE you're getting the money to install your breakers, if they're not you don't need your breakers. Nasir works by forcing the corp to spend which in turn gives you gains.  The problem is if your opponent is just running a bunch of cheap ICE. Then your economy just falters."
Netrunner,3atv2u,X-factor103,2,Tue Jun 23 16:45:18 2015 UTC,That's what the rooks are for. It punishes the Corp for running smaller taxing ice by making them pay a lot more while giving you just a bit more cash that you need. And don't get me started on double Rook. That shit's hilarious
Netrunner,3atv2u,SevenCs,1 point,Tue Jun 23 18:36:18 2015 UTC,"If it was in faction I might agree... but for three Rooks you can get two (which with clone chips is effectively five) parasites. And those are way better at dealing with smaller taxing ICE. Especially since an instant speed parasite (via clone chip or SMC) can nuke anything zero strength that the corp is attempting to use to tank your credit pool. Also no clot means a really bad fastrobiotics matchup since they won't give you the time to get set up and they typically run the kind of ICE suite that offers little gains for Nasir. Rook is just too easily played around, too situational, and too high influence for what it is. Suckers, Imps, parasites, and a one off clot are just better includes."
Netrunner,3atv2u,SevenCs,0,Wed Jun 24 00:24:37 2015 UTC,"Have you played with Rook in nasir?  You get so. Much. Money.  Parasite is okay, but the ability to force to Corp to pay even more for their ice is probably better."
Netrunner,3atv2u,myth_builder,1 point,Wed Jun 24 02:43:32 2015 UTC,"Yeah and then I cut it because I didn't feel it was worthwhile. As for the amount of money the actual net gains aren't as big as you think. Look at it this way: to install it you're effectively paying two clicks and two credits. This means you're not really profiting on it until they rez a second piece of ICE. This only gets worse if you have Opus out because clicking Opus twice will get you four credits with no fuss, a gain which they'd have to rez three Rooked pieces of ICE for (which is unlikely unless you start moving it, which is more clicks spent). But what about the tempo hit to the corp you say? The first rez is actually a bigger tempo hit to you. They've just spent an extra 2 credits, you've spent two clicks. And you may not even get more than one use out of it, you may not even get a single user out of it. If the ICE isn't protecting anything worthwhile currently they may just let you in and then overwrite it after. And yes you get a free access... but so what? You aren't running anything in your deck that benefits from successful runs where you don't get any worthwhile accesses. There's no suckers, no dirty laundries, no desperados.  Also at the end of the day the ICE is still there. This is where it loses to parasite the most. You can make more money, and make them spend more money, by simply destroying their ICE and forcing them to install and rez new bits. Finally Rook doesn't play to the strengths of Shaper, namely their ability to react on the fly. You can't react with Caissa unless you're playing Deep Red, it's simply too slow. You can with parasite."
Netrunner,3atv2u,breakfastcandy,0,Wed Jun 24 10:05:20 2015 UTC,"Crescentus makes Rook really hurt.  But not only that, Rook also gives you money when you need it most and I've easily gotten 6+ rezzes out of one Rook."
Netrunner,3auk7x,grimwalker,3,Tue Jun 23 17:01:02 2015 UTC,"So, the standard questions that every deck posted without an explanation gets:  How is it playing?  What seems to work, what doesn't? What cards are you always/sometimes/never happy to see?  What are good matchups (from your winrate and experience)?  What are poor matchups?  When you lose, what made you lose? Are you flatlining a lot? Traps or operations?  Are you not able to get into big remotes, or not able to police the hand/deck?  Are you running out of cash, or clicks, or both, or just not finding all your pieces in time?  Going fast and running out of steam or going slow and not making it in time?  When you win, is it via remotes, or policing r&d, or stuffing their hand then legworking?  What doesn't the deck do that you want it to do?  What specific area are you looking for suggestions in?  It's much easier for commenters  to help someone who says ""hey all, I have this deck that's been doing well but I have trouble with fast advance scoring from hand.  My hq interface doesn't seem to be enough, since I only get in hq once or twice"".  Then we recommend clot or legwork or siphon /vamp based on the deck, and suggest what to remove for it."

Netrunner,3auk7x,SevenCs,2,Tue Jun 23 19:25:26 2015 UTC,"Isn't that a bit anti synergistic?  A stealth deck is all about recurring credits that you only get once per turn.  So stealth/recurring credits decks get the most benefit out of 1-2 quality runs per turn.  Any more and you run out of those recurring credits.  They're happier making one run one turn and one the next, and not 2 then zero or zero then two  Where as more traditional credit powered decks don't care at all if they run twice in one turn then none the next, or one time each turn, because all they care about is credits.  Basically, what is that one turn boost of clicks going to do for you, since your probably not going to be running more."

Netrunner,3auk7x,RestarttGaming,2,Tue Jun 23 21:31:05 2015 UTC,"The question I always have for Hayley decks is: ""How does gaining these extra clicks help you win?"" In the case of Same Old Thing in a Prepaid economy deck, the answer is obvious. But cards like All-Nighter I'm not sure about. An extra click from a resource install is nifty, but I don't see how it helps move you towards a winning game state. I suspect those slots aren't being used to their full potential."
Netrunner,3auk7x,RestarttGaming,2,Tue Jun 23 19:22:57 2015 UTC,"Overall, what I love about Hayley is that it generally accelerates the Shaper game. Shapers love to assemble a vast array of permanents, and so what they're always fighting against is tempo. Their reliance on installs has multiple avenues for mitigation--they're the best faction for Tutoring and raw Draw power, but there's an underrated theme of click compression--doing things either without requiring clicks, or deferring clicks, or spending clicks in advance."
Netrunner,3aqsl8,RussNP,22,Mon Jun 22 19:26:47 2015 UTC,"Barnes and Noble store management here.  On a break, so I'll get the important bits bullets here quickly.  Core sets are on clearance. That means 50% off.  They will go down to 75% in a month if not sold but ahaha haha good luck with that.  If you call the store, they can check the system and see if it is in the store.  They are not supposed to put it on hold for you, but they might set it aside if you're nice.  If it is still on the floor with the other games, it is still on clearance, someone has just neglected to find and sticker it.  Take it to the register, it will ring up 50% off.

I asked for the reserve date and the end hold date and the employee told me that they were put on reserve on sunday I believe.  The thing is the items all had the red circles on them so the store had to know what was up.

Netrunner,3ar9js,JimTor,5,Mon Jun 22 21:53:55 2015 UTC,"That comment isn't so much about memory usage as tempo. The butchershop matchup is all about making money / finding plascrete as fast as possible, and setting up datasucker to insta-parasite data ravens so you only have to take the tag once instead of many times like you would with mimic. Likewise I'll let a wraparound lock me out of a central for a long time, preferring not to pay 3 for lady until I find plascrete.  You also generally don't want to install mimic vs RP, since their sentries tend to be 3 pup 1 tsurugi 1 susanoo. The ideal endgame rig is lady, zu/cycy/gordian, atman6 (for crick+susan), sucker, parasite. But certain RP players are starting to splash for 1 architect or 1 ichi to force the mimic install and make kate's MU awkward. HB is similar to RP, but of course you want the mimic. Femme gives a lot more flexibility here but of course at the expense of #slottheclot."

Netrunner,3ar9js,Shokujiko,3,Tue Jun 23 10:20:58 2015 UTC,"For HB and RP, rushing behind a tollbooth on remote is key. You can leave your centrals lightly defended and force her to play your remote game, since she's not an anarch and can only hit moderately hard with central pressure. HB's first 5/3 and RP's first nisei are key and worth giving up a lot of tempo for.  For blue sun tollbooth on a remote is still good but you are way more concerned with central pressure. Your econ is a lot more fragile if she can keep sucker loaded so you have to grind it out more. Put ice on archives to foil dirty laundry with gear checks, try to keep hive at 5 subs as long as possible, and protect your late game OAIs with tollbooth in front of them. And play 2 chronos project."

It gets a bad rap because ""oh it's bad at anything other than casual play because you don't know their deck"" but seriously, in most cases you DO know their deck, or at least can tell the general outline of it within the first few turns.  People get hung up trying to hit ""the perfect card"" with it, but honestly, just slapping it down on turn one and saying ""Sure Gamble"" is still super annoying to most runners, and is not going to do anything great for their tempo.  And 90% of the decks out there still run Corroder...  And you can always just use it for piece of mind.  If you're thinking ""I can totally score this, as long as they don't account siphon me to 0 so I can't rez"", then just play your Targeted Marketing it on Account Siphon.  Even if they turn out to have no account siphons in-hand (or even in-deck), you now can proceed KNOWING that they can't zero out your money, rather than hoping.

The targeted marketing had been in play for a while (on inside job, he knows how I love it), and seen 0 use thanks to the fact I NEVER DREW THE DAMN THINGS.  So come the final turn, with three inside jobs in hand, I said fuck it and inside jobbed three times into HQ (ETR ice was three deep in R&D, plus an archer).

I could always take the approach my teacher takes when he's playing Blue Sun - have a stack of credits with credits equal to the amount that the runner's got and then another stack of credits with your extra credits, so the runner can see that if they run and you've got SEA Source then they're in for a fun time :P And by fun I mean Weyland fun, so explosive!"

Netrunner,3arfrq,azb95,3,Mon Jun 22 22:20:13 2015 UTC,"So, this is an interesting deck.  Overall, I like the lay of it.  But I wonder about some of the combos.  Oracle May is a tricky card to try to play with without motivation, as is eureka without test run.  When learning a game, it's nice to have cards that are good by themselves, and then allow combos to follow if you find them.  Scavenge can be useful on its own, but when you see test run, it opens up possibilities.  Similarly, London Library is going to get newbies in trouble.  If you LL your Morning Star, then forget to pull it back?  You just lose.  Or if you scavenge any of your breakers into the heap.  Or if you get hit with program trashing.  This deck looks like fun, but I've gotta be honest, it looks like it'd be hard to pull off really well in a new player's hands."
Netrunner,3arfrq,Stonar,2,Tue Jun 23 07:11:51 2015 UTC,"Losing a breaker to London Library is an excellent teaching moment about click management. Test Run let's you pull cards out of the heap so they are not gone forever. Oracle May is an interesting choice. She used to be a second femme but I found I rarely wanted both femmes to show up. Oracle was thrown in as a ""nice to have"". If she shows up fine, if not, you still have MO."
Netrunner,3arfrq,X-factor103,2,Tue Jun 23 15:38:30 2015 UTC,I will agree that Eureka is probably one of the weaker cards in the deck. Unlike savage and test run it is never good alone. I will think about what it might be good to replace with...
Netrunner,3arfrq,X-factor103,2,Tue Jun 23 16:06:51 2015 UTC,"I'm curious how this would stack up next to my teaching deck. I like to teach people with Kate, as she's got a very simple but useful ability (and getting newbies in the habit of checking constant effects is nice with low-stress Kate). I toss in 2 of each breaker type: usually 2x battering ram or snowball (or 1 of each), 2x gordian blades, and with sentry breakers usually a pipeline and a garrote (to show the difference between efficiencies). I throw in all the Shaper tutors of Test Run, SMC, Clone Chip.  For econ, it's Opus all the way. I brief the new player beforehand about this card and the tutors that will help grab it, as well as why they want it early. I toss in some MU chips to help with the eventual rig.  Then I mix in some cheats to help new runners. They tend to want a full rig before they run, so these help them run sooner. I mix in 3x Tinkering, 3x Inside Job, and a couple of Same Old Things.  I've found that this deck is actually pretty deadly if you ""play nice"" against it as corp for too long. It will have everything a Shaper wants: breakers, money, and tricks to get in almost anywhere. I don't scorch or otherwise intentionally aim to kill my new runner on their first game (we wait until game 2 for that).  You could possibly do something similar with CT. Maybe even with a Stimshop build as a way of saying ""trade a little damage now for the ability to set up your breakers really fast."" Coupled with Box-E and a 1-of Public Sympathy and they won't even blink at a couple points of brain damage."
Netrunner,3arfrq,Stonar,1 point,Tue Jun 23 13:11:10 2015 UTC,"Those are all perfectly valid suggestions. And I like the the idea of contrasting efficiency in breakers.   I try to do that with the first couple games being the FFG demo decks. Then moving to this one. The reason this deck has less recursion/tutors in it is because I use those cards in my ""real"" decks. The point of this was to be a good ""intermediate"" deck that doesn't use too many of the cards I want to use in other decks."
Netrunner,3arfrq,RogueCarpet,1 point,Tue Jun 23 15:44:06 2015 UTC,Yeah. I have that problem as well. Ultimately I end up putting a post-it in the deckbox stating what cards to take out of my main deck and slot into the learner deck (since only 1 tends to be active at any given time). I use the same sleeves so it's no biggie. Some cards like SMC are just too good not to give to a newbie to play with.

Netrunner,3aqje7,shuriken36,19,Mon Jun 22 18:18:22 2015 UTC,"As far as runners go, Criminals have seen a significant drop in popularity in part due to Crick. Anarchs got a huge boost from Order and Chaos from cards like I've Had Worse, Day Job, and Eater. Clearly, I've Had Worse has become a near must have staple for Anarch decks, while Day Job and Eater see less play than when they were first released because...  Net-Ready Eyes. After Lotus Field came out Yog.0 nearly disappeared from play. But now that NRE can boost Yog.0 to break Lotus Field, Mimic to break Ichi 1.0, and Corroder to break Eli 1.0 for 3 credits, the Net-Ready Whizzard archetype has become insanely popular due to it's ability to break almost any ICE for cheap and trash Assets and Upgrades cheaply. This is important because many of the top Corp decks utilize an array of Assets and Upgrades:  RP: Sundew, Mental Health Clinic, Caprice Nisei, Ash 2X3ZB9CY  ETF: Adonis Campaign, Eve Campaign, Breaker Bay Grid, Ash 2X3ZB9CY, Caprice Nisei  NEH: PAD Campaign, Marked Accounts, Melange Mining Corp  Weyland: ...  And, of course, for all Corps, Jackson Howard, in addition to a new near staple of Corp decks: Cyberdex Virus Suite  The most popular NRE Whizzard list has been this one which also incorporates the new card Career Fair: L4J (Looking for Job)  Shapers have seen a resurgence in popularity due to the raw power of the PPVP Kate archetype. The ability of Kate to install Prepaid VoicePad for 1 credit and almost always immediately using that credit means that she rarely loses money setting up her economy.  The most popular PPVP Kate decks have been decks made by /u/Calimsha:  http://netrunnerdb.com/en/profile/57/Calimsha  On the Corp side...  The Fastrobiotics archetype took a big hit from the release of Clot. Clot mostly sees play in Shaper because of their ability to search for it using Self-Modifying Code or recur it using Clone Chip. It seems that nowadays most NBN decks go the way of the ""Butcher Shop"" archetype which threaten tag punishment in the form of meat damage and quickly scoring out at the same time.  For Jinteki RP has remained a powerhouse of oppression. Stopping runs with Caprice Nisei and Nisei MK II tokens. They have only become stronger in this cycle with the addition of Crick (mentioned before) and Cortex Lock: Ridiculously cheap, high strength ICE with often deadly outcomes.  ETF: While I never thought that ETF dipped in power many in the community saw HB as the weakest faction for a short time. But with addition of Breaker Bay the rich have become richer: Adonis Campaigns, Eve Campaigns, Ash 2X3ZB9CY, Caprice Nisei, and Cyberdex Virus Suite all Rez for free.  Weyland: I think a lot of people would agree that Weyland got worse* after Order and Chaos. Blue Sun clearly remains their best ID doing its Same Old Thing: Oversight AI+Curtain Wall.  *The majority of Weyland's new cards centered around the mechanic of advanceable ICE. Unfortunately, the new ""Space/Galatic"" ICE has not been nearly as good as we had hoped. Anarchs also got I've Had Worse which made it harder for Weyland to get the famous one shot kill of Sea Source, Scorched Earth, Scorched Earth.  Definitely look on NetrunnerDB to see the most popular decklists and trends in the game."
Netrunner,3aqje7,ElderMason,2,Mon Jun 22 19:15:28 2015 UTC,Worth noting that clot has played a part in the dip in criminal activity as they lack a way to effectively play it. They don't have the draw power of Anarchs or the tutoring of Shaper and they just lack recursion. On the flip side though Leela has overtaken Andy as the stronger criminal ID.
Netrunner,3aqje7,Rejusu,2,Tue Jun 23 12:29:47 2015 UTC,I don't think Criminals ever struggled to play against fast advance. I don't see many Anarchs running Clot but they are thriving all the same.  Also I disagree that Leela is stronger than Andy. Draw power and set up still continues to be the weak point of Criminal and as long as that is the case Andy will be the Queen of Consistency.
Netrunner,3aqje7,ElderMason,4,Tue Jun 23 19:35:52 2015 UTC,"SanSan Cycle has brought out a lot of neat option for all factions of both sides. The only card I’d say was truly a big shakeup so far is Clot, an Anarch virus that, while installed, prevents an agenda from being scored the turn it was installed and is trashed if virus counters are purged. It’s a hard counter to fast advance.  Beyond that, I’d say the largest trend is more tools being made available to the runner in Order and Chaos that actually force the corp to react to the runner. Eater, for example, is a very efficient AI breaker. The downside is you access no more than zero cards if you use eater at all. But since you’re still accessing zero, you can use replacement effects. Instead of access zero cards you can use Keyhole, Account Siphon, Singularity, etc. Eater Keyhole is a thing and you’ll see corps teching against it with Crisium grid (turns off all the replacement effects you might want to use with Eater) or Swordsman to trash AI breakers like Eater.  Valencia is a new Anarch runner introduced in O&C. Her says the crop starts the game with one bad publicity. That turns on all kinds of nasty cards like blackmail that were nearly unplayable previously. If you’re not running bad pub removal in your deck, you’re going to have a bad time against her. But do you really want to waste deck slots on a card you’ll only ever use against one ID if you’re not already playing bad pub cards?  Personally I feel these are great changes for the game. Playing corp often felt like solitaire and the game had swung into the corp’s favor a bit. This forces you to pay attention to the runner or they can wreck your day real quick.  That’s all I have time for right now. I know that’s not a lot of specific but gives you an idea of how the game has shifted."
Netrunner,3aqje7,jkopplin,5,Mon Jun 22 19:12:22 2015 UTC,"The big ones on the Corp side are the science ICE: Gutenberg makes running R&D against NEH pretty scary, and almost makes David feel better than Corroder as insurance against it as well as a Wraparound breaker. Turing isn't amazing or anything, but it's worth remembering, as a lot of HB plays it as it's on par in power with IQ. Meru Mati isn't any kind of huge deal but it's pretty likely to be Weyland's HQ ICE, so if you want to try to Siphon them into unrezzed ICE at least make sure you have Corroder. Probably the most important is Crick, as it turns running Archives to proc RP's ability into a totally different proposition than it used to be, as well as makes Susano a lot better."
Netrunner,3aqje7,Calc3,2,Mon Jun 22 19:44:05 2015 UTC,I don't think I'd ever splash for Turing but in faction it's a nice include in faction. I put in a one off and I'm almost never sad to draw it.
Netrunner,3aqje7,jkopplin,1 point,Mon Jun 22 20:34:41 2015 UTC,I've always liked running a single Susanoo (or the slightly worse Changeling out of Weyland before NRE hit) just because of how often runners are cold to it.  I saw you with Susan at the Philly finals.  Was that card doing work for you all day?
Netrunner,3aqje7,Glitch29,3,Mon Jun 22 20:53:11 2015 UTC,"I think I rezzed it twice. It's good. It's a very tough gear check, and it's only really bad vs david or a ton of sucker counters. The nice thing about Susan is that you basically never rez it if it isn't good, and at worst youre going to vamp the runner into installing a femme or a huge atman with it. Kate in particular can have a very hard time dealing with a Susan remote."
Netrunner,3aqje7,Calc3,5,Tue Jun 23 01:28:11 2015 UTC,"Some other cards aren't as big but are making something of a splash these days also:   Net ready eyes: lots of people are raving about this shaper hardware. It's a cybernetics card that deals you 2 meat damage when you install it. But every run thereafter you can designate a breaker to receive an automatic +1 for the rest of the run. Splashed into anarch fixed breaker decks, it's seeing a LOT of use (yog and mimic love this card). symetrical visage: it's like pro con, but neutral and only 2 to install. However, as a genetics card it typically only fires once. The first time you click to draw, you also get a credit. Doesn't seem like much at first, but a lot of top decks are using this to retain tempo while drawing. I've recently tried it in place of earthrise hotel in my own deck, and it's pretty sweet in use.   These are just a couple of examples, but I'd encourage you to take a peep through some online lists of what's come out. There may be individual cards that just fit perfectly into your particular style of play (my friend has been trying to run an HB kill deck for a long time now, and the new Cybernetics Division ID was a godsend to him). Check them out!"
Netrunner,3aqje7,X-factor103,1 point,Mon Jun 22 19:40:52 2015 UTC,"IMO all of the deluxe expansions thus far give you awesome value, straight up get O&C because there are a ton of great cards on both sides.  Individual cards from the SanSan cycle:  Symmetrical Visage is incredibly and surprisingly strong, Clot is an interesting power check to fast advance, Adjusted Chronotype is allowing Anarch's to do Wyldside again.  The positional ice (Gutenberg, Crick, Meru Mati, and Turing) are all pretty powerful in their own way. Cortex Lock is an interesting early game Ice but loses steam really quickly. Oaktown Renovations is a really solid Weyland agenda that you can advance without losing tempo (because it's rezzed and gives you 2c when you advance).  Aside from those, I've found the SanSan cycle pretty lacklustre. I've been considering cancelling my subscription at my local shop and being more ""pick and choosey"" in the future. There has been an awful lot of chaff in these packs..."

Netrunner,3aqocz,psytrooper,8,Mon Jun 22 18:55:24 2015 UTC,"Well, that can certainly happen.  If you want to experience it the way early adopters did, starting with Genesis and slowly going down the list is the purest way.  My advice, though, if you want to expand a casual cardpool slowly, is to start with the deluxe boxes. It's the best way to get a radically different feel from each faction in a single go. It broadens your experience in several directions at once. Also, this way, no faction will really be overpowered.  Side advice: Get What lies ahead and Opening Moves ASAP if you get the chance."
Netrunner,3aqocz,treiral,4,Mon Jun 22 19:11:44 2015 UTC,What I would suggest is find a deck that really speaks to you and buy the packs that are needed to complete it. Then continue to do that as you see new decks that you really want to play. This was the advice of /u/nelsormensch on Terminal 7 and I really think it is great advice.
Netrunner,3aqocz,serjfan7,5,Tue Jun 23 05:56:21 2015 UTC,If you're casual you can buy the pack in order. I honestly think it's the best way to expand. You will never have something that'll completely overpower you.   The closest thing to that would be Noise if you don't have Jackson Howard (in opening move). But remember people played without Jackson before.  So go in order slowly.
Netrunner,3aqocz,Bsq,3,Mon Jun 22 19:57:44 2015 UTC,"I'd say buy a given cycle all at once.  A lot of cards seem ""eh, ok"" in datapack 1 only to be ""omfg awesome"" by datapack 6.    I'd recommend trying what I'm doing - make a list of all the cards and attempt to make, and win with, using each card.  I don't try to win with each card, that's not really how ANR works, but just to win with a certain card in the deck - hopefully having used it some how."
Netrunner,3aqocz,Snivy_Whiplash,2,Mon Jun 22 19:03:02 2015 UTC,"If I had to start netrunner today, I'd just buy up the old data packs in a way that suited my budget. There isn't that much change in the card pool from data pack to data pack when you're looking at the backlog, it's the brand new stuff that really has an appreciable impact. Choose the old data packs based on what kinds of decks they support and what kinds of decks you want to play (the exception being Opening Moves, which you will definitely want ASAP). You also don't need to worry about jumping into later cycles because with the exception of a handful of cards there's nothing that is simply broken without specific counters. So when Underway comes out in a week or so, I'd buy that one because it's the brand new business that will give you an idea about the direction the game is going.  The deluxe expansions you need to be more careful about buying because they introduce a massive number of new cards and there are so many synergies between them that you might be giving a major boost to one faction that the other factions don't get. I'd recommend making those expansion a more major event because if you're playing casually and you pick up H&P, for instance, you'll be given a big advantage if you decide to play Jinteki and your opponent doesn't. It'd be worth spending extra time digesting a deluxe expansion before purchasing another."

Typically you could get one scored because of the combination of them being slowed down by both Housekeeping and grail ice gear checking. Rez Galahad, they put down Corroder, bounce Galahad, put down Lancelot, etc.  Biggest problem the deck had was the multitude of Eater builds going on when I built it. Tons of Cutlery events and easy Account Siphons / Wanton Destruction made it feel weak sometimes. But it slowed down 'standard' criminals to a full stop."

Once you get familiar with the card pool, I would look into watching games played on OCTGN. They're not necessarily pretty, but the quality of play tends to be quite high. One of the hardest things about learning Netrunner is separating the wheat from the chaff; it's very difficult to differentiate between pretty good players and very good players, and it's no mystery who you want to be learning from. OCTGN videos also afford you commentary from the players as they play the game, whereas real-life videos are at best commentated by other players, and usually just without commentary at all.  my youtube channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcBJqxcaNx_qesZn369p1Mg  kiv's youtube channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-8Ph6h3pRqpIatKjf5yhdg"

The runner should have been forced to discard down to 5 (keeping the siphon in hand) and committ to account siphoning the corp as the first click of his next turn.  Instead, the runner got to know what he ice on HQ is  for free, which is HUGE if you're trying to siphon him."

Coming from a Magic judge point of view, this could have been a game loss for the runner due to the inability to fairly rewind due to a release of hidden information. Unfortunately, ANR has so much hidden information that this is bound to happen more often, so you have to take that into consideration."

Netrunner,3aocmk,Shokujiko,10,Mon Jun 22 04:13:50 2015 UTC,I believe it would depend on whose turn it is.  Simultaneous triggers always go to the active player first.
Netrunner,3aocmk,ABigDumbBaby,1 point,Mon Jun 22 04:21:36 2015 UTC,"The question of which effect happens first does indeed depend on the player - if they are considered triggered abilities, and not replacement effects or another category of rules.  There are a few leftover questions though - can chronos protocol partially resolve, if going second?  Most things can partially resolve, but is it treated as a partially resolvable effect, or is the whole thing prempted by ribs ""taking"" the damage so chronos can't trigger it, like multiple ""instead of accessing"" effects."
Netrunner,3aocmk,RestarttGaming,1 point,Mon Jun 22 05:19:41 2015 UTC,"Only if they're both triggered abilities. From the wording, Chronos Protocol sounds like a constant ability, which goes before triggered abilities."
Netrunner,3aocmk,level42somacruz,4,Mon Jun 22 14:45:42 2015 UTC,"According to the current rules, when two or more abilities trigger off the same thing, the rules on cards controlled by the active player (player whose turn it is) get to happen first.  Furthermore, even if an effect cannot be fully resolved, the parts that can be are always resolved once triggered.  So we know which effect triggers first, depending on whose turn it is.  However, we dont know if the first effect prevents the second or not.  Does the first trigger invalidate the second?  There's a case for this, as it says in the rules Once an ability is triggered, its effect is resolved immediately and can only be stopped by PREVENT or AVOID effects.    This would seem to indicate that the player whose turn it is gets to chose the card discarded.  So are both of these effects triggered abilities?  or is one or both rules replacements, similar to how harmony medtech works, instead of triggered abilities?   If they aren't triggered abilities, how do rules replacements order of effects work?  Does the first invalidate the second, like replacement effects for accessing?  or does the second overwrite the first?  Can chronos protocol partially resolve at all?  or, if Ribs triggers first, does it ""take"" the damage so Chronos can't use it (similar to how you can't security test and bank job on the same access?)  Or is it similar to other ""partially resolvable"" effects, like how you can play diesel even if there are only two cards to draw, and you will just draw two cards.  The only way to know for sure is to follow the lead designer on twitter and refresh the page at regular intervals until he answers a question about it.  Thats the official netrunner rules resolution method."
Netrunner,3aocmk,RestarttGaming,3,Mon Jun 22 05:17:05 2015 UTC,"I think in this case, chronos protocol would have priority since it's worded as a constant ability, whereas Titanium ribs is worded as a triggered ability (it uses the word ""whenever""). See this thread for some details about constant vs. conditional abilities."
Netrunner,3aocmk,level42somacruz,2,Mon Jun 22 14:42:17 2015 UTC,"I think both are triggered effects (rather than Titanium Ribs being Continuous) as they use the words ""whenever"" and ""first"". Other abilities with those words have been ruled to be triggered conditional abilities.  This means if it's the runner's turn, I think their ability will go first, if it' the corp's turn then theirs will go first. What this actually means though, I don't know. Does the ability going second ""win"" as it selects the card to be trashed last? Does the card get trashed first and so the second ability cannot fire? Who knows!"
Netrunner,3aocmk,Kandiru,2,Mon Jun 22 08:09:16 2015 UTC,"this has been asked a few times.  the general consensus is that it depends on whose turn it is.  i don't think many people have thought about, if Titanium Ribs fires first, does Chronos Protocol still get to look at the runner's grip though.  i don't think we'll get an official response until the card is released.

Mostly that reason is that Criminal fracters suck.  Look at what Criminals have for barrier breakers:   Aurora. It's pretty much functionally equivalent. Except it's 1 more to play than corroder. And 1 less base strength. And it costs 2c per subroutine. And the pump up is expensive, so much so that even if you're going up against it's ""ideal"" target (a 4 strength barrier with 1 subroutine), it costs 1c more than corroder to break the same ice. When it's ""best case"" scenario means that Aurora costs more to use than Corroder, it's easy to see why people would take corroder. Breach. Which is only efficient at breaking multi-subroutine barriers. Of all 28 barriers currently in the game, 8 of them can potentially have 3 or more subroutines. Most of those are conditional (have X subroutines equal to ____). Even there, corroder beats it out for value. Also, breach can't be used on a remote server, severely limiting your options (and giving the corp a good way to hard-lock you out of remote servers if you play it early). Spike. Variable strength based on number of programs installed, trash to use. Very situational, at best."

Supplier Andy/Iain with Vamp. You say not much will change, but there's a good chance the big box will be out by then. The mini-factions are a big unknown.

Netrunner,3ambpk,Forever_Flaccid,5,Mon Jun 22 04:08:44 2015 UTC,"there are two more types of ice within the grail suite which can still tax the runner. as a grail player myself, i'd say parasite recursion is much more dangerous than NRE Yog. i've learned to play around it. my own deck is supported by NEXT ice so i'll usually try Gold + Merlin if there isn't a cheaper way to tax them on a remote. they can't NRE mimic AND yog. and if they have datasucker, then i'll purge."

If it is ... well, then FFG throws competitive play out of the window and the whole thing will be a crapshoot anyway, so any preparation will be in vain.  Good idea with regards to Grail, did any Grail variants placed well in recent regionals? If yes, could you provide a link?  The other two (Stealth Kate, Supplier Andy), did either perform well in recent events?  Thanks :-)"
Netrunner,3ambpk,2414682040998,2,Mon Jun 22 15:14:10 2015 UTC,Magic Pro Tours always come right after a new set release as part of competitive play is deck building. Why do you say it will throw competitive play out the window?
Netrunner,3ambpk,fkevelairn,2,Mon Jun 22 19:18:27 2015 UTC,"Comparison to Magic is troublesome because Magic has a much larger playerbase, including a rather large group of professional players who can work full-time on assessing the implications of a new set. Also, Magic has been around for much longer, so the design space has been mapped rather extensively. If I understand the game correctly, it's very rare that a new card comes out and the professional community says ""I have no idea how this will affect gameplay"".  On the other hand, Netrunner is very young, and does not have a dedicated professional community. We already know that D&D is going to kick the metagame in the teeth -- C&C, H&P, and O&C all lead to significant upheavals, and right now it looks like they were nothing compared to the three new runners that are coming in D&D.   The community has little understanding of the game's fundamentals as they exist now, and even that will diminish with D&D. The end result will be great -- I'm sure tons of new ideas and archetypes will emerge. But it will take months. I would prefer Worlds to remain conservative and stick to what we know. Then take a year to figure out the new runners until Worlds 2016.  Edit: A good example is Hearthstone and Grim Patron. Most professional players thought it will be a jank card. Took a while until the meta stabilized around it. And Hearthstone has many more players, and a core of professionals that Netrunner is missing."

Next to no rez cost, purged Lampreys and scoring with 0cr. Several opponents commented on the rarity of Reina in tournaments. Might just be the German (or Berlin) meta, though. I spent a lot of time just digging for cards, even with Vigil and Earthrise. Definitely didn't feel very consistent."
Netrunner,3ambpk,ElderMason,2,Tue Jun 23 14:07:04 2015 UTC,"That was my impression as well.

Seriously. At one influence it will also see play out of crim and shaper. I'm going to try it in Haley stealth first since the 1 credit save covers the cost of every single ""stealth credit"" card in the game along with Clone Chip/Astrolabe/MemChip and also combos with Haley allowing a free install on the Corp's turn."

Netrunner,3ao9mm,Riizu,32,Mon Jun 22 03:43:03 2015 UTC,"You weren't around back in the day before Jackson.  The corp needs access to all the mechanics he provides, or sometimes it just loses by default."
Netrunner,3ao9mm,neutronicus,12,Mon Jun 22 04:04:59 2015 UTC,"Right. Something I wanted to say in my original post is something you tackle here. Jackson is basically a hard fix for the problem of agenda flooding, which was an issue way back in original Netrunner. Once sufficient Agenda points ended up in the Archives, it became a war of attrition to see if the corp could somehow keep the runner out of there while also attempting to advance in other servers (fun fact, they can't). Jackson makes it so that you don't have to overextend yourself protecting a server that might be worthless in one game, and vitally important in another. J-Howe basically serves to normalize Archives across all games, while providing a little additional functionality to the corp in terms of enhanced draw (which partially helps the runner by moving through RD lock, or milling their deck a bit more)."
Netrunner,3ao9mm,automatiq_jack,8,Mon Jun 22 04:23:27 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I think OP just criticised his ubiquity without really analyzing why he's so common. It's a mechanic that the Corp needs to survive.   What bothers me more than anything else is his influence cost. I think a card as necessary as he is should be neutral, or there should be alternative cards in the other factions that provide comparable effects. As it is, every other Corp has to deal with three less influence while NBN gets a free pass."
Netrunner,3ao9mm,BlueHg,2,Mon Jun 22 10:56:49 2015 UTC,"I think that cards are being printed now that have slightly comparable effects to Jackson, and more will come. Architect and Crick come to mind to protect Agendas in Archives; Daily Business Show helps prevent the Agenda flood in the first place.   I'm sure more will come. But I feel like those three, at least, are the first 'wave' of post-rotation Jacksons"
Netrunner,3ao9mm,EgosNest,2,Mon Jun 22 14:32:33 2015 UTC,"Ice as a method of protection for agendas in Archives is notoriously unreliable. It might fire one time max, often times never against a good player.   DBS is fair, but as noted, influence is still an issue for everyone besides NBN."
Netrunner,3ao9mm,BlueHg,3,Mon Jun 22 16:35:29 2015 UTC,"That's definitely true about the Ice. Still, I think it's a sign of the kind of design space that will be explored - NBN, so far, has assets that counter Agenda flood through manipulating card draw (and Corporate Shuffle, for that matter). Jinteki is able to protect its archives better than most - Crick, plus Shock and Shi-Kyu, might make a runner not even want to check; not to mention two Agendas that protect themselves. HB has Architect but more importantly has a lot of, and is getting more, install shenanigans that allow them to move cards around a bit - but they could get a lot more (and I forgot to include their ability to mitigate accesses, through cards like Ash and Hudson 1.0, probably more later). No idea what Weyland has (other than, ""you don't even WANT to steal these Agendas, buddy."") but maybe that's just going to be one of their intentional, faction-specific weaknesses going forward.  That being said, a part of me does just wish that Jackson's ability, or something like it, were part of the core rules - not even a neutral card, just another 'click' ability on top of the other standard ones - 'click: place one card in archives on the bottom of R&D.'"
Netrunner,3ao9mm,EgosNest,2,Mon Jun 22 17:09:57 2015 UTC,"I agree with you a lot actually. I'd love to see faction flavored alternatives to JH, but no card from the other factions that's out right now is as efficient as it would need to be to patch the hole in Corp gameplay that JH does. I hope FFG designs towards that in the future."
Netrunner,3ao9mm,BlueHg,1 point,Mon Jun 22 21:21:15 2015 UTC,"With DBS, as with Jackson, the influence issue comes into effect again. Free for NBN, and the rest have to pay up. Makes me want to just play NBN, especially with how often I lose as HB. :-)"

Netrunner,3ao9mm,neutronicus,13,Mon Jun 22 16:54:08 2015 UTC,"I guess the question is: why is a card being popular equated with being unhealthy?  I've yet to see anyone have an issue with sure gamble or hedge fund, yet they are by far more common.  Jackson howard isn't overpowered, he just fills a role corps desperately need filled.  I very much think that there are no special actions that are going to be taken regarding Jackson.  The game will evolve with each data pack released, and cards will rise and wane in popularity.    In fact, the very next pack has a card that very much interacts with Jackson and other popular upgrades and assets, Drive by.   It interacts with a wide range of cards and i very much doubt it was designed with a ""we need to knock card X down a peg, lets print a special card against it"".  It's a broad card designed to shift how you deal with certain common situations, but if you had to name a card it is most targeted against it would much more be caprice nisei.  However, as the game evolves and new cards are released, these interactions happen and shift balance."
Netrunner,3ao9mm,RestarttGaming,2,Mon Jun 22 03:59:35 2015 UTC,"It isn't so much that Jackson is popular that is arguably a problem, it is that he is both popular and sometimes difficult for new players to acquire.  Personally I love Jackson Howard and find him wonderfully designed. Playing him properly requires more skill than some players realize.  But Opening Moves is never in stock at any of my local game stores, and new players don't realize how important he is until they've lost more games than they should really have to.  If Jackson was in Core he'd be great and there'd be few complaints, perhaps on the level of complaints about Datasucker and Parasite. He's not in core though and that causes a bunch of problems."
Netrunner,3ao9mm,striatic,2,Mon Jun 22 06:06:15 2015 UTC,It's just that you joined in the time after  opening moves was out of stock and before it got reprinted.  Once the reprint goes out it will all be fine again

New players balk at having to immediately buy a certain Data Pack, even if it is readily available. Instead of picking some packs based on the cards and strategies that interest them, they immediately have to go out and purchase a ""patch"" to fix the game. They also go through a period of losing a bunch of games before realizing they pretty much need him. No matter how available Opening Moves is, this will still rankle new players to a game that already has problems attracting new players. Again, if Jackson was in Core, this wouldn't be an issue."
Netrunner,3ao9mm,striatic,1 point,Mon Jun 22 17:27:16 2015 UTC,"sorry, was in mobile and assumed you were OP.  No matter what Corp you are playing, if you play core set only you won't be able to compete with people who use the full card pool.  Having opening moves or not won't change that.  No ""core + one pack"" deck can compete with a full card pool deck, that's just the nature of deckbuilding games."
Netrunner,3ao9mm,RestarttGaming,1 point,Mon Jun 22 18:03:44 2015 UTC,"I'm not talking about ""core + one pack"" competing with full card pool.  I'm talking about the experience of new players entering the game feeling forced to buy a certain very particular thing first, or very soon, when the first things they should be buying after core are the packs/expansions that intrigue them the most. You know, for fun?  Instead they are essentially obligated to buy a second core set, which is just more of the same cards they already have, and Opening Moves a particular Data Pack that they might be least interested in.  If you can't understand why this is antagonistic to new players, I don't know what to say. It presents a terrible first impression that keeps people at home playing core on the kitchen table - if they continue playing the game at all - instead of seeking out the broader Netrunner community. I organize and attend a couple of Netrunner nights a week, every week, and I can count on a single hand the number of new players who I've met in the past year. The drop off rate is just brutal because the initial expansion experience for new players is brutal. The Jackson Tax is part of that, and bad for the game, even though as an individual card he is good for the game."
Netrunner,3ao9mm,striatic,13,Tue Jun 23 09:07:06 2015 UTC,"First, welcome to the game. You'll be here a while.  Second, Some counterpoints:   To my knowledge, no card in A:NR has been banned from tournament play, and there are probably other cards more deserving of that dubious honor over Jackson. There are give-and-takes to his use, his primary purpose is burned out after trashing him (no infinite Jackson recursion) and his trash cost is low enough that, if encountered in the hand or RD, he can be disposed of easily. As a single card, it's fairly balanced and the rules as written don't set up a kind of bonkers series of exceptions that can tip the game in one player's favor overmuch. As such, probably not ban-worthy for those reasons alone. Rotation probably won't eliminate J Howe for the reason that he or something very much like him will show up in another pack. He's just too useful. Additionally, it's going to be a while before Opening Moves is cycled out, and Jacko's ubiquity is not lost on the devs - this gives us plenty of time to start seeing Jackson-like cards that will fill in his deckslot handily. It's been done (Hades Shard), but the thing that makes J Howe so problematic on the runner end is the timing structure in which he is used. Right now, nothing on the Runner side (save the Shards) fires BEFORE J Howe does, and that's the thing that makes him killer. While it is possible that cards will be published that prevent asset trashing during runs, or lock the composition of Archives, they're just going to be a hate cards for Jackson, and won't see much use because they'll lack any kind of broad utility. There's a reason nobody runs Archives Interface, or Records Reconstructor - and the reason for that is because the problems they solve aren't worth keeping them in your deck. See my first point. Jackson is pretty balanced, and there are already strategies for getting around him, and even for using his ability in your favor (for example, making an archives run to increase RD agenda density, then making a Maker's or Medium run; waiting for the right moment to install then pop a Hades Shard, etc). He's not a silver bullet, and a smart player can think of ways to force the corp to use him, or to play around him. This is literally never an issue, and I don't know of a single FLGS group that won't allow a new player to proxy a card until they get one of their own. If it's a tournament issue, most people have JHowe's floating around that you could probably work something out with a friend (someone I know has four playsets, and one of them seems to constantly be floating to new players entering our meta).   J Howe is a frequent topic of conversation amongst newer players on this board, and the general consensus is that he is somehow overpowered. Once you start seeing the windows, Jackson becomes much less of a threat because you'll know how to manage him."
Netrunner,3ao9mm,automatiq_jack,6,Mon Jun 22 04:10:51 2015 UTC,Jackson is so important to the health of this game. He will absolutely need a functional reprint when it comes his time to rotate. What could possibly lead you to the conclusion that Jackson is a problem?
Netrunner,3ao9mm,notminebydesign,7,Mon Jun 22 04:13:09 2015 UTC,"I've noticed that a lot of newer players tend to think J Howe is OP because they forget to account for him in their runs, or otherwise assume he's a benign presence on the board until he suddenly isn't. It's one of those mindsets that you move past as you grow in skill."
Netrunner,3ao9mm,automatiq_jack,6,Mon Jun 22 04:26:22 2015 UTC,"I think they just see Jackson in every deck, and assume a card that's in every deck must be OP."
Netrunner,3ao9mm,neutronicus,9,Mon Jun 22 04:30:10 2015 UTC,"Probably. Years from now, we'll be telling wide-eyed kids about how we used to play with not one, not two, but THREE Jackson Howards in our deck and there will be a protracted gasp, awed silence, and a small voice that begs us to tell the story again."
Netrunner,3ao9mm,automatiq_jack,2,Mon Jun 22 04:37:18 2015 UTC,"A reasonable conclusion, seeing how Hedge Fund is easily the most OP corp card."
Netrunner,3ao9mm,ABigDumbBaby,4,Mon Jun 22 05:01:46 2015 UTC,"The fact that he is a new player and didn't ""enjoy"" the pre-Savior days of getting molested by Noisemill shenanigans."
Netrunner,3ao9mm,JOJOBASS,5,Mon Jun 22 09:36:57 2015 UTC,"Jackson has become a necessary part of the game. Noise was so incredibly powerful before Opening Moves; if he milled Agendas, your only options were Archive Memories (2 influence, and could only be used on your turn) or Project Virtruvius (which requires an overadvanced agenda and for you to be playing HB). Agenda flooding and a simple bad mulligan was also remedied by Jackson.  Additionally, there ARE cards that combat Jackson; namely Hades Shard (defensive Jackson is common move against a runner with 7 credits) and Scrubber/Whizzard.  The last thing I want to see is any kind of ""utilization"" of cards removed from game (like they did with Yu-Gi-Oh). Removed means removed; it's meant to be a big deal."
Netrunner,3ao9mm,Shokujiko,3,Mon Jun 22 04:00:53 2015 UTC,"You're misunderstanding Jackson. Just because he's used almost universally in Corp decks doesn't mean that he's OP. In many cases, his inclusion isn't to help the Corp win, but to help the Corp not lose, if you get what I mean by that; he can prevent and circumvent situations that would leave a game literally unwinnable by the Corp due to bad draw/agenda flooding. His ubiquity doesn't upset game balance, it actually aids it. The only action that should be taken regarding Jackson is to either allow him to be proxied in to to just reprint Opening Moves already Jesus Christ FFG get on that shit."
Netrunner,3ao9mm,aschr,8,Mon Jun 22 15:54:23 2015 UTC,"IMHO,  The problem with Jackson isn't that he exists, it's that he's an NBN card. He de-facto gives all NBN decks 3 extra influence, and this grinds my gears."
Netrunner,3ao9mm,aerisdead,3,Mon Jun 22 04:55:16 2015 UTC,"NBN were very weak at the time Opening Moves was released, and considered the weakest faction in the game (because, to be frank, they were).  I don't think this is a particularly valid argument though, other factions have other benefits and autoincludes. As a quick example: Jinteki gets access to Celebrity Gift, which otherwise is essentially unsplashable, as well as the sought after Caprice (not even mentioning its agenda suite). All factions get something that's sought after and regularly splashed. There aren't many Corp decks without 3x Eli.  It's worth pointing out too that not every deck wants Jacksons. There are only a few outliers, but they exist: non-Combo CI (which is now dead, but did exist), GRNDL Supermodernism, etc."
Netrunner,3ao9mm,Xenasis,6,Mon Jun 22 14:04:29 2015 UTC,"I find this argument quite pointless. If you claim that ""jackson gives nbn 3 extra influence"" you should also acknowledge that all HB decks got like 30 extra influence because of their ice and economy package."
Netrunner,3ao9mm,RumRogersSr,-1,Mon Jun 22 13:40:19 2015 UTC,"This is problematic for sure. I never understood why both Jackson and that redraw-your-hand card (dont remember what it is and am on mobile) are NBN cards. Maybe they saw NBN as weak at the time, which in hindsight couldn't be further from the truth."
Netrunner,3ao9mm,inglorious_gentleman,4,Mon Jun 22 06:09:07 2015 UTC,"NBN is the ""card draw"" faction, with Jackson, Anonymous Tip, and Corporate Shuffle."
Netrunner,3ao9mm,BlueSapphyre,1 point,Mon Jun 22 11:30:36 2015 UTC,"Yeah I get that, but since the mechanic of getting out of agenda flood is so important to the Corp it makes little sense NBN gets to have that influence free. It would be ok if there were other mechanics that would be so crucial, but there simply aren't any."
Netrunner,3ao9mm,inglorious_gentleman,1 point,Mon Jun 22 11:45:27 2015 UTC,"I agree. At the time he was printed, and still currently, NBN has the highest agenda density (3x Astro, 3x Beale, 3x NAPD, 2x Breaking News) with 11 agendas, which is why they needed the benefit getting agendas they weren't ready to score out of their HQ or out of Archives against Noise the most.   That said, I suspect once he rotates, we'll get a neutral version of HQ flood prevention, as it's an inherent problem to all corps, even when you're running 7-8 agendas in a glacier."
Netrunner,3ao9mm,BlueSapphyre,3,Mon Jun 22 11:58:36 2015 UTC,"The Corp definitely needs it. The problem with JHow isn't the fact that he's overpowered, but that he makes every non-NBN Corp spend influence on him. He most likely should have been printed as a 0 or 1 influence cost neutral card. But since that won't happen, I think the best answer is to print similar cards in all other Corp factions. Even just replacing his draw mechanic with more infactioned flavored abilities would do"
Netrunner,3ao9mm,RichardLocke,2,Mon Jun 22 07:57:57 2015 UTC,"I think the better solution to the ubiquity of Jackson Howard is to print new cards for the other factions that have different mechanics but serve the same purpose and with the same efficacy. Rework is much like this, but it's very weak and inflexible and didn't really see play even before Jackson was released. Daily Business Show could have been reskinned as Weyland or Jinteki and it would have given players some more dynamic choices in utility cards (instead of handing NBN another consistency machine). More forms of agenda/archives management for the other factions would help solve both the agenda flood issues that are ever present in the game and the Jackson Howard problem of being the one good solution."
Netrunner,3ao9mm,rumirumirumirumi,1 point,Mon Jun 22 12:11:05 2015 UTC,"I'd expect that sometime before Jackson Howard is cycled out (still years away) we'll see more cards that each tackle a portion of his functionality.  IMHO, Daily Business Show was maybe the first such card."
Netrunner,3ao9mm,lobotomy42,1 point,Mon Jun 22 14:06:19 2015 UTC,"That creates a new problem. of then running 3 Jacksons, and the new card. Which can make it kind of overpowering."
Netrunner,3ao9mm,t-lor,1 point,Tue Jun 23 12:24:06 2015 UTC,"I don't exactly see how you figure that. We already have DBS, which can combine with Jackson for powerful hand management, but those aren't going to let you score agendas they just help you manage when you have agendas where. The problem with DBS isn't that its combination with Jackson is too good but that they are both NBN, so one faction has access to these kinds of management cards more easily than other factions. Giving a strong alternative to Jackson in the other factions will balance Jackson in the game because the problem isn't that Jackson is too good but that there's nothing that solves the long standing corp problems like he does.  I'd actually be happy to see a deck that piles on utility assets like Jackson Howard. Right now the only IDs that do that are NEH and RP. But if Weyland got an infaction card that can manage agenda flood, it would make Gagarin look appealing as an ID."
Netrunner,3ao9mm,rumirumirumirumi,1 point,Tue Jun 23 13:49:10 2015 UTC,"There is an imbalance in the core set between Noise's power and the lack of Archive recursion (except for the extremely inefficient Archived Memories). The imbalance increased throughout all the Genesis cycle and culminated in Creation & Control with Clone Chip. FFG corrected the imbalance with JH. The problem isn't him, the real problem is Noise."

Netrunner,3ao9mm,mayhemnc,1 point,Mon Jun 22 06:59:54 2015 UTC,"I don't think any of those suggestions are great, mostly beacause they just aren't needed but also because bannings and errata suck.   It's rough that his reprint was messed up by timing and the dock strikes. But its an important card that fixed a design flaw. Sometimes due to the shuffle the runner will just win, and without Jackson it happens so much more often."

Netrunner,3aijtd,Bwob,8,Sun Jun 21 18:47:31 2015 UTC,"This card is really interesting.  It takes 7 runs before it has cost them more than if you'd just rezzed Bastion in the first place.  (Assuming they're using a corroder.)  That's a lot, and is probably not worth it unless you rez it on a central server that they're hitting a lot (usually R&D), and rez it early.  And as people have mentioned, it's like a magnet for parasites and other ice destruction, because no one wants to deal with an unreasonable strength barrier late game.  (Once I even got someone to Femme it!)  It has an interesting psychological effect on people - if people have ice destruction, they usually stop running on it until they can take it out.  (Sometimes they'll run a few times if they're using Knifed, but for parasites, its basically a ""stay out until you get a parasite"" sign.)  If people don't have ice destruction, then they get super careful (usually overcareful in my estimation) about running through it, trying to make sure it doesn't climb up very high.  So.  In most games, it's a slightly-cheaper bastion, that may not end up as good as bastion.  But it's also a 3-cost neutral card that either guarantees that they will spend some ice destruction on it, or makes them run a server far more infrequently.  Tentatively, I think I like it?  It's a good answer to super-aggressive decks, especially ones that use on-successful-run credits/tokens to hit servers repeatedly in one turn.  Just don't compare it to Eli, or you get sad."
Netrunner,3aijtd,cdwols,4,Sat Jun 20 17:53:51 2015 UTC,"why compare it to Eli or bastion? Why not compare it to the other 3 rez 1 sub barrier: wall of static, in which case the 5th run takes it from cheaper to more expensive. If you stick it on the server that's going to be run the most then it could rack that up reasonably quickly, and after that it's a huge profit"

Perform a hostile takeover of part of the city and turn it into a corporate town!  That abandoned warehouse you set up as a false lead for the runner didn't pan out. Why not turn it into some snazzy new lofts for your employees?  Break some news about the latest crime spree and then buy up the property after you've destroyed it's value!  Do some groundwork and acquire the licence for developing an area without underhanded tricks and you don't even have to sacrifice the agenda!  No idea for the interaction with Eliza's Toybox, though. I guess satisfying some exotic tastes for those at city hall gets you some extra consideration when it comes to zoning laws?  As an aside, Celebration, Florida exists as a fairly recent real world example of a corporate town created by a media conglomerate and was apparently just as unsettling as the card art when it was first built."

Netrunner,3aeu4h,MrSmith2,3,Fri Jun 19 16:20:52 2015 UTC,"It's one of those cards like Eve Campaign or SanSan City Grid, where you're pretty happy to see the runner trash it before it's rezzed.  But once rezzed, it's worth putting a lot of effort into defending it."
Netrunner,3aeu4h,Glitch29,4,Fri Jun 19 22:48:16 2015 UTC,"I've had a single copy of this card in my deck for a while now, but I've only gotten to use it once. That said, that game I found it so useful that I'm inclined to keep it in  It's certainly difficult to use. You have to have a scored Hostile (or other 1 pointer), a separate remote from your scoring one, and an opponent whose playing resources. Oh, and you have to draw it.  But if you get those three things, it really smushes them. It'll roll over Security Testings, Daily Casts, Earthrise Hotels, Ghost Runner, and Kati Jones, stuff that people just take for granted if they don't plan on taking tags. And then, they either have to play the rests of the game without resources, or they have to trash this annoying thing for 5 (I guess 4 with the bp from the Hostile) which may have ice they don't have a breaker for. Often the best play is to leave it unrezzed, unprotected to have them check it, and reluctantly trash it because they're deathly afraid of losing their resource econ, even if you don't have an agenda yet."
Netrunner,3aeu4h,llama66613,3,Fri Jun 19 16:33:37 2015 UTC,"Its a bit of an oddity, since I'm not sure which 1-point agendas you really want to be feeding this guy. Hostile Takeover would be the most obvious choice, but then again, BP makes it harder to protect assets, and unless you only need to burn a few resources before overwriting corporate town, it seems unlikely to me you want to give up your scoring remote for it. I don't want to score chronos project every game, and I certainly wouldn't whiff with it just to activate Corporate Town. It seems the best out of maybe Titan Transnational (if you're playing Firmware Updates for Marky Mark to gobble up) or maybe out of Faction.  Breaking News makes for a solid trash target, and helps you manage runners who are keeping up with your economy--allowing you to more consistently threaten Midseason/SEA Source. I could see this as a viable last 2 influence for a Butcher Shop deck that wants to punish rich runners. And if +Hand size decks ever become really strong, then this would be a vector of trashing those assets and getting your kill online."

Netrunner,3aeu4h,serjfan7,2,Fri Jun 19 16:53:17 2015 UTC,"One thing I love about Netrunner is that the game rules support running a few situational cards.  For Corps, having an Archived Memories or Closed Accounts sitting in your hand the whole game still provides a lot of defense against runs on HQ.  For Runners, a card that's worthless in some matchups may eventually be discarded to damage, either saving the flatline or protecting some other card in your hand.  Cards like Net-Ready Eyes and Stimhack reward playing hit-or-miss cards, as they give them some guaranteed use as discard fodder in any matchup.  Of course, with too many situational cards you still end up discarding to hand size for no value."
Netrunner,3aeu4h,Glitch29,2,Fri Jun 19 23:03:33 2015 UTC,"I've been considering this card in Industrial Genomics.

Netrunner,3aeu4h,ErikTwice,1 point,Sat Jun 20 01:07:31 2015 UTC,"This is a very powerful effect and I think there must be at least a couple decks that can take advantage of it.  First, this is a card for glacier decks, the goal is to wipe out the Runner's economy so you can score with impunity behind your Curtain Walls or stack of Bioroids or whatever. It gets rid of Kati Jones and Symmetrical Visage and keeps Daily Casts, Armitage Codebusting and Liberated Accounts off the table, which accounts for most of a Runner's economy. And, most importantly, it requires no action on the Runner's behalf.  Right now I'm playing a slow Blue Sun deck with 2xCaprice and it's a good tutor target. They either smash themselves against Caprice to get rid of a non-agenda or they let it wreck their economy. Win-Win.  As far as factions go, it should be playable in NBN, HB and Weyland though I have only tried the last one. HB benefits a lot from getting rid of Kati Jones and it's not a huge drawback to use Domestic Sleepers in slower FA builds or sacrifice an Accelerated Beta Test. NBN should work, but it's missing the economy options necessary to play a Glacier deck.  Still, very interesting card. Worth testing, at least."
Netrunner,3aeu4h,heffergod,1 point,Fri Jun 19 17:08:22 2015 UTC,"This actually absolutely wrecks Anarchs these days.  Almost their entire economy is in resources, so killing a loaded Kati or a Liberated is really nice.  If they then go broke getting into the server to trash it, you end up way ahead.  I only run 1 copy in my Blue Sun deck, but it does great work when I see it.  Not amazingly useful against PPVP Kate, but can still be good if you can snipe their last Same Old Thing if Levy is in the heap."
Netrunner,3aeu4h,monkeymoat,1 point,Fri Jun 19 17:50:39 2015 UTC,I love the idea of Blue Sun running with this and traps and bouncing this back over and over while installing traps and the runner has no idea where to run to keep their resources  from blowing up.
Netrunner,3aeu4h,heffergod,3,Fri Jun 19 19:48:37 2015 UTC,"The only problem with bouncing this back over and over is that it eats an agenda each time you rez it, and that's not really a thing you want to do."

Netrunner,3aeu4h,PanzerD,1 point,Fri Jun 19 20:48:54 2015 UTC,"I like the theme of this card but I suspect I'm like everyone else in that I'm unsure of what kind of build to put it into. My intial concern is what agenda do I sacrifice to rezze it. I feel Hostile Takeover is the main contender but the BP is undesirable. Secondly, do I bother protecting it? I like the idea of making the runner break into a taxing server to trash it but I have my doubts. Do I include a singleton with  Executive Bootcamp or rely on Project Atlas counters? Does this card want to be in a rush deck or a glacier deck? Thoughts?"
Netrunner,3aeu4h,Mabniac,1 point,Fri Jun 19 19:55:57 2015 UTC,"I tried it with Eliza's Toybox, but the runner has a full turn to react and it's not that great, unless they play a metric ton of resources. As a surprise (with the proper agenda composition), this can do some unexpected damage. But then, why not just play Archer?  I should have opened with that. Why not just play Archer?"
Netrunner,3aeu4h,m50d,2,Fri Jun 19 23:16:01 2015 UTC,"Why not both? If you're already running a Toybox/shenanigans deck (I built a HB deck once with Toybox, OAI, BER, Awakening Center, ABT and a pile of expensive ice (including Archer) - and Mandatory Upgrades to make Toybox much better - and Melange for the same effect).

Netrunner,3afok0,flamingtominohead,3,Fri Jun 19 19:30:17 2015 UTC,"Correct. It's not uncommon to see this fire on the runner's turn if they facecheck an architect out of NEH. Since architect would allow the corp to install a card, and NEH allows the corp to draw the first time they make a new server, DBS can fire off that card draw. It is the first time the corp is drawing that turn (the runner's turn).  Also multiple DBSs stack. So if the corp has 2 rezzed, they can draw 3 and put 2 on the bottom of RnD.

I'm not aware of any other situation in any card game where triggered abilities get collated like that. There rulebook certainly doesn't go into a level of detail that would explain it.

Netrunner,3afok0,TheRabbler,1 point,Sun Jun 21 02:11:23 2015 UTC,"I don't think being a MTG judge is going to help here. I have a very strong rules understanding there, but it's not helping with the DBS template.  If you have two copies of Sylvan Library in play, you draw three, then put up to two back, then draw two more, then put up to two back.  Sylvan Library is a triggered ability though. If you're looking for a replacement effect, there's Chains of Mephistopheles, but that's a different can of worms.  For DBS to be templated in work the way it does now using Magic's more precise templating, it would have to read ""Whenever you would draw a card for the first time each turn, draw two cards instead. Whenever you draw a card for the first time each turn, put a card you've drawn this turn on the bottom of your R&D."""
Netrunner,3afok0,Glitch29,1 point,Sun Jun 21 05:31:24 2015 UTC,"You're right, I guess I haven't read Sylvan Library in a while.  The way it's worded, it probably should be two individual triggers, but doing so in this case would make multiples worthless.  I suspect FFG wanted people to have more reason to play the card rather than strictly adhere to poor templating."
Netrunner,3afok0,TheRabbler,5,Sun Jun 21 07:29:12 2015 UTC,"It's the first time you draw, which is usually the mandatory draw. When you install it, you've already made the first draw that turn, so it will not fire. It's best to wait to rez it until the end of the runner's turn.  An example of when it won't fire on the mandatory draw would be something like being NEH with a DBS already installed and rezzed, and using Tech Startup to fetch an asset and install it into new server, getting you a free NEH draw. Also, it fires when you draw on the runner's turn, such as with NEH again, or something like Fisk Investment Seminar."
Netrunner,3afok0,dodgepong,2,Fri Jun 19 19:30:34 2015 UTC,"To add to what everyone else said, this also applies to Symmetrical Visage. I tried using it after I drew it with a click and realized I could not."
Netrunner,3afok0,serjfan7,1 point,Fri Jun 19 22:25:14 2015 UTC,"Only on your mandatory draw, because the was the first card draw of the turn. The game state remembers the first draw of the turn even though DBS wasn't Rezzed at the time."
Netrunner,3afok0,kjncl,1 point,Fri Jun 19 19:31:45 2015 UTC,"Right now, it only fires on the mandatory draw because that is always the ""first time you draw a card"" on your turn. If there were ever a card or effect that caused you to draw before the mandatory draw, or to not have a mandatory draw, then DBS would fire on whatever was the first time you drew.  DBS does fire during the runner's turn if they make you draw (Errand boy, for example).  If you install DBS, rez it, then draw a card, that's not the ""first time you drew a card that turn,"" and so it doesn't fire.  In short: it doesn't necessarily only fire on the mandatory draw, but it effectively does because that's always going to be the first draw of each turn."
Netrunner,3afok0,JohnQK,1 point,Fri Jun 19 19:33:29 2015 UTC,"It works on the first draw of each turn. On the corp turn that's generally mandatory draw. If you install and rez one for your first click and draw for second click, you don't get the benefit since you've already had your first draw of that turn.  It can also fire on the runner's turn, say if they run into an errand boy or you have some other draw effect that can be activated on the runner turn. But again, only on the first draw, not the first draw after DBS has been rezzed."

Netrunner,3aeimt,tiedyedvortex,9,Fri Jun 19 13:54:51 2015 UTC,You can use Executive Bootcamp on the same turn it's installed.   You can use Executive Bootcamp to counter Blackmail.    You can use Executive Bootcamp to move Ice (By rezzing it and returning it to your hand) even if the runner isn't running there. This can be important with Curtain Wall.  It's harder to trash.
Netrunner,3aeimt,NetrunnerCardAccount,1 point,Fri Jun 19 14:00:18 2015 UTC,"Ah, I hadn't considered the moving ice ability. I knew that the one-credit discount technically worked as profit for Blue Sun but you should already have more money than God so that isn't typically that important. But being able to slap a Curtain Wall down on R&D and then move it to a scoring remote when you need to is huge."
Netrunner,3aeimt,Calc3,6,Fri Jun 19 14:06:04 2015 UTC,"One of the biggest mistakes intermediate players make in Netrunner is assuming that because someone has a lot of money that it shouldn't matter if they get any more.  Glacier, and Blue Sun in particular, needs a lot of money to rez ICE. If someone is sitting on $30 and has no ICE rezzed, they're practically broke in my book."

Netrunner,3aeimt,AnalysisSitus,2,Fri Jun 19 16:08:02 2015 UTC,"Well, Blue Sun only become rich by taking money back from rezzed ice. The fact that you have 30 credits only get you so far when all your ice is derezzed."
Netrunner,3aeimt,Xenasis,3,Fri Jun 19 17:53:40 2015 UTC,"Tech Startup takes a turn longer and the trash cost is quite significant. A 1c trash cost makes R&D extremely porous.  EBC having utility outside of that, e.g. against Valencia, is really nice, too."
Netrunner,3aeimt,robots-dont-lie,4,Fri Jun 19 14:12:02 2015 UTC,"EBC is such a great card.   Tutoring snares against legwork or just diluting HQ with an adonis, denying dirty laundry/sec testing, tutoring jacques howard or just keep it on the table and get a 1 cred discount each turn."
Netrunner,3aeimt,thefalseidol,2,Fri Jun 19 14:22:17 2015 UTC,"EBC is much better for Blue Sun, purely because of its targeted rez, and luckily, the card continues to keep giving:  Tech Start-up is great, but usually you want to be pulling assets without a ""start of turn"" trigger, because they will be missed on that turn. Since your main target is your Adonis campaign, tech startup flounders a bit. If you are playing a variant with Root/IT Dept./Melange, then you could make a better case for Tech Startup, since it is cleaner in terms of clicks to get your asset online.   Tech Startup would occupy your scoring remote for at least a turn and change before you start seeing dividends on you Adonis campaign, which is enough time for you to score an agenda rather than just letting an asset durdle around in there.  You have no Fast Advance options, meaning that denial decks/blackmail abuse can become a real problem early, EBC helps you get those credits invested in ICE and build a secure remote server. Even if they are a minority concern, it costs you nothing to take them into account and play a card that gives you a little counterplay against those decks.   3 credit trash cost is much more resilient and can be a noticeable tax on the runner if they need to keep them off the table."
Netrunner,3aeimt,ayylmao31,2,Fri Jun 19 14:44:42 2015 UTC,"EBC is the luxury Tech Startup. Even if you are using it to bring up Eliza's or Capital Investors (start of turn independent useful assets), it's almost always better to play EBC. It has a few strong side benefits that make it worth the 1c tutor.  Tech Startup is for other factions who can't afford to slot EBC influence but still want that EBC effect.  I love me some Tech Startup though."
Netrunner,3aeimt,PaxCecilia,1 point,Fri Jun 19 16:44:15 2015 UTC,"I suppose that Bootcamp is a little more resilient to trashing, both in play and your deck. Having too many low trash cost cards can make your R&D very easy for the runner to access agendas more often.  Additionally, it lets you rez ice for a discount of 1. That could matter."
Netrunner,3aeimt,Feliks878,1 point,Fri Jun 19 13:58:31 2015 UTC,"1) Lower trash cost...especially important in R&D, but matters when installed as well if you want to tax them. 2) EBC can be used when the runner is making a run on it.  Basically, if you draw it you're guaranteed to get it to fire if you really want Adonis.  You can also use it right after you install it to get Adonis going next turn, rather than having to wait an additional turn. 3) A second ability that is useful in some situations, especially against Valencia Blackmail recursion."

Netrunner,3aeimt,TheSemiotics,1 point,Fri Jun 19 14:02:27 2015 UTC,"This....is an interesting point. I'm curious what other people will say. Certainly versus Blackmail Valencia you'll wish you had Bootcamp, and depending on your meta that might be reason enough. I suppose you can also use it to rez, bounce, and replace an ice (rather than trashing it) if you want to adjust how a server is built later in the game. Certainly could be useful to get Curtain Wall as outer most ice again.   Also, because you control the trash on Bootcamp, you can use it to bait the runner. Again, this likely won't happen most games, but I can see how the added utility might make it worth it.  Here's my question, are people using Breaker Bay Grid with Blue Sun? Rez your Adonis for free, take 3, bounce for 4, net 7?!"

Netrunner,3adjn3,poorhaus,6,Fri Jun 19 06:15:35 2015 UTC,"I think including Quandry and other taxing code gates in the same deck is a bit tricky.  After all, Quandry is pretty much just designed to be a bit of a speed bump that forces the runner to go fetch their Decoder.  However, once out, it's pretty much trivial for any Decoder to break.  Sure, you could trash it and replace it with some other ice, but now they have their Decoder out and can break any of your other 6 code gates in the deck.  Why not drop the Quandries and replace it with some other taxing sentries, maybe 2x Ichi 1.0s + 1x Sagittarius/Lab Dog or somesuch?  Or maybe a big bioroid barrier or two, to give them something to chew over and make their other breakers work a little for their keep."
Netrunner,3adjn3,PostalElf,1 point,Fri Jun 19 09:24:21 2015 UTC,"I don't see what the big deal is.  Gear-check early, tax late.  Punish a quick Zu.13 with taxing code gates.  The real problem with Quandary right now is the Anarch resurgence.  You can't really rush an Agenda behind something that dies immediately to Parasite.  Because of that, I've been preferring Enigma."
Netrunner,3adjn3,neutronicus,2,Fri Jun 19 17:29:11 2015 UTC,"There's no real ""do both at once"" option.  As you emphasize your ability to gear-checking early, your ability to tax late is going to decrease.  Some decks can really capitalize on early protection (I'm looking at you AstroScript Pilot Program), but you get very limited value out of most decks."
Netrunner,3adjn3,Glitch29,1 point,Fri Jun 19 19:42:28 2015 UTC,"Sure there is.  Just have both things in your deck.  Few more copies of the gear-check stuff so you see it early, just a couple copies of the big taxers.  Basically every glacier deck does this with their ice mix."
Netrunner,3adjn3,neutronicus,1 point,Fri Jun 19 19:49:40 2015 UTC,"I'm probably trying to state something too obvious.  Which makes me a little embarrassed to have not gotten the point across.  Your deck has 49 cards in it.  The more gear-check ice you put in, the fewer of something else you're going to have.  Any Quandary you put in could have been an Ichi 1.0, a Successful Demonstration, an Ash, or any other card.  Every Quandary or Paper Wall is there only by a card being cut from some other function of the deck.  I'm not saying that Quandary is wrong.  But you definitely lose out on something else by your decision to include it in your deck.  Your language seems to be dodging the fact that deck-building decisions are ""Either A or B (or C...),"" not ""A or not A"".  Considering that Quandary does little to absolutely nothing (in the case of Yog.0) once a Decoder is in play, it's effect of shutting down a server for a few turns has to have some good value for your deck.  If that Quandary's worth less than Ichi 1.0 (/u/postalelf's suggestion) then Quandary shouldn't be in your deck."
Netrunner,3adjn3,Glitch29,2,Fri Jun 19 22:19:38 2015 UTC,"I know what you were trying to say.  I just think, put bluntly, that /u/PostalElf is wrong.  Early cheap EtR is good, and you shouldn't cut it because it's ""not taxing enough"".  Especially not for Ichi 1.0, which is worthless without ... you guessed it, cheap EtR to force a breaker install.  Big late-game ice is taxing enough."
Netrunner,3adjn3,neutronicus,1 point,Fri Jun 19 23:30:04 2015 UTC,"Fair enough.  I don't disagree with the conclusion.  (Although ""taxing enough"" is a dubious concept when there are no critical thresholds)  It's just very odd to respond to ""+1 X, -1 Y?"" with ""That's wrong. Just use some X + some Y + some Z!""  It took me a while, but I'm beginning to understand your way of speaking where complicated things are obvious, and everything comes with extra hyperbole.  What I saw as a response indicating a fundamentally flawed understanding of the question was really a non-response to the question and a quick transition to broader statements.  Just FYI, because tone sometimes doesn't translate in text. I'm laughing right now. Partly at how much dramatic flare you manage to inject into card analysis, and partly at myself for typing so much about it."
Netrunner,3adjn3,Glitch29,1 point,Sat Jun 20 00:53:41 2015 UTC,True that.  I usually don't try to rush an agenda behind a quandary unless there's a Caprice or Ash for protection.   Personally I'm seeing a lot of Yog because of NRE.  If the ice is going to get blanked I'd rather it cost 1 to make them spend 5 than cost 3.
Netrunner,3adjn3,Kandiru,2,Fri Jun 19 19:36:23 2015 UTC,"I quite like NEXT Bronze over Quandry. The 1 Strength means it is more durable to instant parasites, and against Atman having 3 of them means you can vary the strength a little more."
Netrunner,3adjn3,neutronicus,1 point,Sat Jun 20 10:29:51 2015 UTC,Now that's a very interesting suggestion. I will absolutely try that out. Three extra credits could be worth parasite resistance. Without other NEXT ice it's still blanked by Yog but much better against Zu.13 etc.
Netrunner,3adjn3,neutronicus,1 point,Sat Jun 20 17:31:23 2015 UTC,"If the ice is going to get blanked I'd rather it cost 1 to make them spend 5 than cost 3.   No one's gonna react to a Quandary with a Yog install, though.  It's almost certainly either Parasite (out of Anarch), or Zu.13 (out of Shaper).  I like Enigma for early ice, install, advance plays.  Doesn't die immediately to Parasite, and gives the runner one click fewer to find the breaker they need (which is relevant where Special Order is involved).  And sure, maybe they install Yog or Parasite it, but if I got one agenda out of a 3-cost ice I'm honestly pretty happy."

Netrunner,3adjn3,rwknoll,1 point,Fri Jun 19 20:34:58 2015 UTC,The quandaries are there mostly to protect things cheaply early.   I don't want a 5c hit to protect an adonis and Ichi and sagitarius dont' end the run.  I'd replace them with Ice walls if they were in faction.  I could consider paper walls so getting out a decoder doesn't blank them. But I don't think this deck is that much of a rush deck.
Netrunner,3adjn3,Glitch29,2,Fri Jun 19 19:34:36 2015 UTC,Solid deck with a good writeup. Turing provides lots of problems current Runner decks can't deal with.

The versatility of it isn't worth the Security Testing/Lamprey you're giving the runner.  And it will usually be an outer piece of ice in the early game, which is the only time gear checks matter.  That said, rwknoll's right that it's a wombo-combo behind a Turing.  What I think is more noteworthy is that it has the same combo with ELP.  And that version doesn't require dedicating two ice to a server when you might not want to.  Two clicks to drain 2 creds might still be a good deal for the runner, but it's exceedingly marginal at best.  Chimera probably still isn't worth it (and I definitely wouldn't want more than one), but I'm looking at this deck and I'm a lot less certain about dismissing it than usual.

Is it money, multi-access, end the run ice, taxing ice? Then slot in something that more or less fits from your cardpool, eg replace RnD Interface with Maker's Eye, Howard Jackson with Archived Memories, Same Old Thing with Deja Vu. Some unique effects just can't be reproduced, like Blackmail or Emergency Shutdown. When playing against friends who are using the same cards this doesn't matter. When facing opponents with access to the full cardpool, you might find yourself learning that certain cards would be very useful. This will help you choose the next datapack you buy."

Netrunner,3aclw3,JohnQK,1 point,Fri Jun 19 02:16:41 2015 UTC,"There won't be any competitive decks you can build out of just the core set and one expansion, but you can take the pre-built deck from Order and Chaos (the decklist should be on the box insert) and add cards from the core set to improve it.  Weyland was one of the stronger factions in the core set, so you should have a fairly good base for an in-faction deck.    If you want to know what to buy in order to make a competitive deck, you can find decklists on Netrunnerdb.com and pick up the expansion packs that include the cards you need.  Of the Corp IDs in Order and Chaos, Blue Sun is probably the best and certainly has the most recent tournament activity.  If you would rather build towards something older (which means less datapacks to get), you should look up Supermodernism."

Netrunner,3aaqmg,nelsormensch,30,Thu Jun 18 16:04:40 2015 UTC,"Ok, this agenda is fucking insane. It's absolutely amazing. You get 8 credits just scoring it, and more if you can keep it in the server a little longer.  Seriously, let's compare this to your other 4/2 options as Weyland. You've basically got NAPD, Corporate War, and Geothermal Fracking. NAPD is often unplayable if you're running Hostile Takeovers, which you definitely want to be running for Archer. Corporate War earns one less credit, and earns you those credits conditionally with big consequences if you fail.  So how bout the last one? Geothermal sees a decent amount of play. And it certainly earns you more! At 14 credits, the reward is definitely greater. But wait, you also had to spend 2 clicks. So it's actually earning you more like 12. Still 4 more! ...for 2 bad publicity. So, 2$/bp. Yeah, not a great deal.  The only other options, Glenn Station, H3 Deposit, and Private Security Force, are fringe utility agendas.  However, the best benefit of Oaktown I've yet to mention. Not only does it earn you 8 creds, a ridiculous amount for scoring a 4/2, but it earns you some of those creds immediately. The benefit of this is huge.  Here's a situation: I've got like a Caduceus on R&D, a Quandary on HQ, and an Wraparound on a remote, all unrezzed. I'm at five creds, and because I've got a rush build I want to try to score an agenda before they get breakers and econ. If it's a Geo, or an NAPD in HQ, there's no way I'm going to IA this turn. Rezzing the Wraparound won't even leave me with enough creds to score it next turn!  But if it's an Oaktown, no sweat! You better believe I'm going to IAA, and sit pretty with 7 creds. I can comfortably spend 6 creds rezzing all ice on the field, and still be able to score it next turn. And if they install a fracter and walk right through my Wraparound? Oh well. Didn't lose any time or money on it.  And that's the best thing about Oaktown. It allows rush decks to score agenda points without slowing down, or being set back if the runner steals it. If you play GRNDL or Titan, it's time to put in 3xOaktown Renovation, because it is boss freaking nova for your strat.  Now, all this enthusiasm and I still haven't addressed the one downside of the card: the revealed install. That's because it's basically no downside at all. Every 4/2 in the world is going to be advanced the turn it is installed, usually once. So what is the runner going to think if he sees that in a remote? Not only does Weyland have 0 advanceable ambushes, but no ambush in the game is scary with only a single advancement token. The only possibility other than an agenda is a GRNDL refinery, which also something that want to access and also isn't scary with a single advancement token. So the really information you're giving them is exactly which agenda you're trying to score, and one way or another, they're going to find that out in the next turn anyway."
Netrunner,3aaqmg,llama66613,11,Thu Jun 18 17:45:08 2015 UTC,I love this agenda so much more than I thought I would.  My favorite interaction:  the ability to score it even when I go to 1 credit left rezzing ice or using an ash trace to protect it.    1 credit left: Advance (gain 2 credits).  Now I have 2. Advance (Gain 2 credits).  Now I have 3 Advance (Gain 2 credits).  Now I have 4 and score    I LOVE it

I guess the downside with Melange compared to an over-advanced Oaktown is that Melange leaves another agenda in HQ for the inevitable Legwork.

Netrunner,3aaqmg,Rejusu,2,Fri Jun 19 02:54:47 2015 UTC,"Just a correction, you're not taking into account the cost of advancing it. It will get you a net of 4 for scoring it, typically 6 as most of the time you'll want to IAA and then triple advance with it. It's bonkers with the root though as it let's you convert those recurring credits into real credits. Other great things about it is that you can continue advancing it even if you're on a single credit and it actually increases your capability to rez ICE rather than reducing it."
Netrunner,3aaqmg,Rejusu,1 point,Fri Jun 19 10:33:17 2015 UTC,"Oh, sorry, I didn't mean to imply that you gained a net of 8 credits. Just that it earned you 8 credits when compared to other 4/2s."
Netrunner,3aaqmg,llama66613,2,Fri Jun 19 09:18:08 2015 UTC,"I know, it's just best to look at net gains and losses when it comes to credits. Otherwise it can make a card seem better than it actually is. Not saying that Oaktown isn't good, it's a fantastic card, but saying it earns you 8 credits makes it sound stronger than it is."
Netrunner,3aaqmg,Rejusu,2,Fri Jun 19 16:08:07 2015 UTC,"Your post reminds me of a great piece of advice that upped my Jinteki trap game. How do you get runners to hit your traps?  The answer isn't to play master mindgames. It's to create lose/lose situations for the runner (or win/win for the corp). You get something out of it either way. With Oaktown Renovation, either you get more money than you had while taxing the runner to get into your scoring remote, or you make money AND score. Weyland especially has the ability to combo a larger pool of money into a SEA Source or Midseasons into meat damage.  I was hesitant when I saw this card, but after reading this bit (especially about a faceup install) I'm really optimistic about its use. Who cares if it's face up? You need to create a lose/lose situation for the runner when you drop it. Do you want to run this agenda? Well, either way I'm going to come out on top."
Netrunner,3aaqmg,X-factor103,2,Fri Jun 19 20:12:25 2015 UTC,"Mostly agree, two caveats:  1) Geothermal Fracking. Fracking is a way to bank credits in a way that you can't really do with Oaktown. It also bursts credits super well for you to go click for 7, biotic labor, sea source double scorch.  2) no ambush in the game is scary with only a single advancement token  AggSec can be game ending with 1 trash. Shattered Remains kills plascrete. Reversed Accounts can drain 12 credits the next turn."
Netrunner,3aaqmg,sigma83,3,Fri Jun 19 17:12:35 2015 UTC,"Your Geothermal Fracking play is really weird. You're importing a 4 influence card to net... 3 credits. If you had scored a Oaktown instead of Geothermal Fracking, you'd have 8 more credits, plenty to kill the runner with.  Totally right about that second point though, traps can be brutal with just a single token. I guess I just discounted the power of traps because I'm terrible at bluffing."
Netrunner,3aaqmg,llama66613,4,Thu Jun 18 19:23:55 2015 UTC,"Honestly, Geothermal Fracking belongs in a Midseason Replacements deck. Then you frack for 14 and permatag them"
Netrunner,3aaqmg,lordwei,3,Thu Jun 18 23:26:05 2015 UTC,Really? Oaktown seems perfect for a midseasons deck. You can keep clicking it for two credits and they have to steal it to turn it off.
Netrunner,3aaqmg,llama66613,4,Fri Jun 19 01:46:28 2015 UTC,I'm sorry! You use both. Geothermal to bank 14 creds and Oaktown is bonkers because you can goad the runner into risking their hide. It's been a long day for me haha
Netrunner,3aaqmg,lordwei,22,Fri Jun 19 01:51:08 2015 UTC,"Note, to get credits back from this, you actually have to use the ""advance a card"" action. So placing advancement tokens using other cards (e.g. Shipment from Kaguya/SanSan, Space Camp, Mushin No Shin, Trick of Light) won't get you any credits back. They do get you closer to the higher payout though.  Reoccurring credits for advancing cards via things like The Root or Simone Diego are just turned into legit credits with this though, so $$$."

Truly a corporate agenda if there ever was one.  I also work at a biotech company which  adds even more of a sense that I'm kind of living this game.

Netrunner,3aaqmg,ItJustGotRielle,-2,Thu Jun 18 17:15:32 2015 UTC,"Not quite. It's quite easy to let them score the Oaktown and gain their 4c. If they honestly think advancing Oaktown more than a couple over is any good, I'm fine with that. Capital Investors is basically the same thing, except a little different, and you don't see it starting a new wave of Midseasons decks with infinite money because often times the Runner can outpace 6c a turn. But it doesn't stop Oaktown being the best 2 pointer printed for Weyland outside Atlas.  The two-way lose condition is more with Breaking News and Butchershop, where in typical NBN fashion if they get it at the right time they 'just win'."
Netrunner,3aaqmg,ayylmao31,2,Thu Jun 18 18:47:16 2015 UTC,"Oaktown has far more compression than capital investors, and it activates midseason, where investors does not. Tempo is a big factor here- install advance advance leaves you with 2 points you didn't have next turn if they don't take it, and investors leaves you with net 2 if you install-click-click it (like Oaktown) except they can just out-money you if you get into a money fight (take 3, click Kati, until your density goes up enough for them to win). Oaktown gives them reasonable incentive to run through your taxing/nasty remote or essentially give you 2 free points with no tempo lost. In a midseason deck it's perfect, except the overadvancing idea is still weak, since you get a max of 6 credits per turn triple advancing it, which the runner can stay ahead of easily."
Netrunner,3aaqmg,PaxCecilia,1 point,Thu Jun 18 19:53:59 2015 UTC,"I totally agree. Tempo is Weyland's best and only friend, and Oaktown is off the charts in that category. Spot on. I was addressing some other posts in this thread about people dreaming of overadvancing it reliably."
Netrunner,3aaqmg,dinte,5,Fri Jun 19 16:08:51 2015 UTC,"Crap, I was scrolling after posting and deleted my post... >_>  Oaktown Renovations ends up being surprisingly good. Let's consider cases when you Install Advance Advance (IAA) then the runner scores the agenda: Oaktown Renovations against NAPD Contract. IAA Oaktown gains you 2 credits. NAPD loses you 2 credits and costs the runner 4 credits. If you can leverage a credit differential, then both cases are not bad.  In the case where they don't steal Oaktown it's awesome. Doubling up on actions is the best way to maintain tempo. Compare it to Dirty Laundry, letting you get a successful run and earn credits in one click can help you stack lots of effects together for a big pay off. Being able to advance your agenda and effectively click for credits simultaneously is powerful: you aren't lowering your credit pool for the runners turn.  Overall, I think this is a really cool design space and an awesome card in particular."

Against Blue Sun they're thinking any advanced card is an agenda anyway (at worst a shattered remains) especially when any vegan-side is exposed.  Why not make money off making public what everybody knows?   Oaktown backed by an Ash behind decent ice is wonderfully evil.  The fact that you typically install-advance-advance a 2-pter and are tempted to both advance to 5 and leave it there for advancing to 8 shows just how interesting an addition to agenda pool this card is."
Netrunner,3aaqmg,jottootts,2,Thu Jun 18 16:48:17 2015 UTC,"I LOVE this card. I've been playing it in Gagarin with SEA-Scorch and Ash, and the tax it takes to get in and steal this thing can completely obliterate the runner's cash stockpile. And since it's a bright, shiny, face-up target that pays you to score, the Runner cannot leave it the hell alone. And then the Runner dies. It's fun."
Netrunner,3aaqmg,chrsjxn,1 point,Thu Jun 18 16:32:42 2015 UTC,"Almost every agenda costs you in both clicks and credits to score out. Oaktown Renovation takes away the credit cost, and actually gives you a profit to score this agenda. It's awesome!   Unlike Hostile Takeover, which gives you a Bad Pub, and Corporate War, which can actually make you lose credits, this one lets you get the profit immediately, and keep using it to turn clicks into credits as long as it's out there."
Netrunner,3aaqmg,Terkala,1 point,Thu Jun 18 18:13:00 2015 UTC,"Oaktown Renovation, if you score it out the normal way, even nets you 1 more credit than winning the corporate war. And you can score it as a 5 advance agenda for a net of +6 credits."

It does assume you start the turn with at least 7 credits however, to make the order-of-operations work.  Install>advance>biotic>advance>biotic>advance>advance.  You need at least 7 to start with or you won't be able to advance after playing the last biotic. But you end up with 3 credits.  Edit: Changed zero credits to 4 credits, because I miscounted."

Now we have a 3rd state that's not covered in the rules, face up and neither rezzed nor unrezzed. I'd hate to have learned the game strictly from the rulebook and run into this card.  Pg 12.   The Corporation’s installed cards have two play states: rezzed, which means that the card is faceup and active, and unrezzed, which means that the card is facedown and inactive."
Netrunner,3aaqmg,BlueSapphyre,1 point,Fri Jun 19 14:05:31 2015 UTC,"I don't see an issue with it though. Carving out new design space merits adding to the rules without harming the core set rules. There's always been caveats to the rules (komainu, chum, tennin, caissa, q-chip) so the new player will have some things to tackle, like we all did when we were green and showing up at our first GNKs. I think cards and clarifications like this add complexities to the game to make it more dynamic."
Netrunner,3ac8zp,StabbyJim,9,Thu Jun 18 22:46:54 2015 UTC,"New pieces of ice are always installed in the outermost layer protecting a server. There are cards that contradict these rules, but they specifically tell you where the ice is supposed to be installed. There's also an operation called Sunset which lets you rearrange the ice protecting a server, and asset called Tenma Line which lets you swap the positions of two installed pieces of ice, and a sysop called Midori that lets you swap a piece of ice protecting a server with a piece of ice in your hand."

Netrunner,3aa40c,RestarttGaming,36,Thu Jun 18 12:55:18 2015 UTC,"I see your issue. I disagree with your solution.  From my experience, posting a dump of videos at once usually results only in the 1st video getting the views and almost nobody watching the last ones on the list. Most people have the time to watch a 20 minute video. Hardly anybody has the time and stamina for a 4-hour binge.  This is obviously a problem - not so much from the standpoint of karma, but simply because the effort into the production of the videos is wasted if nobody is watching them.  The strategy most of the established video channels use is to thin out the schedule and only post every 2nd day or so. The previous video has usually disappeared from the front-page by then.  The current pile-up is due to some new channels popping up and posting multiple videos at once. I'm looking at you /u/neoreadinggrid and /u/shammieg . Great job on the videos. Please pump the breaks a bit on subsequent releases. Give people time to watch your videos.  Also, it's regional season and there just have been a lot of tournaments recently. Things will eventually calm down."
Netrunner,3aa40c,Krystman,4,Thu Jun 18 13:13:52 2015 UTC,"I know that /u/neoreadinggrid only posts a video once a week (every Wednesday). Sometimes during the swiss rounds of tournaments 2 videos go up instead, which was the case this week. But never more than 2 simultaneously and then a week between each post..  I think the main issue here isn't multiple posting by any single user but simply that there is a lot of this type of content going up right now.   Luckily reddit has built in solutions to all this. You up and down vote at will so that content people most want to see filters up."
Netrunner,3aa40c,Imrahill,2,Thu Jun 18 15:22:16 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the feedback, it's good to have both sides discuss.  I do see your point - if the current influx is more regionals based and off of new channels backlogs, it probably will die down to more acceptable levels.  I'm just worried that perhaps it's not just backlogs and regionals, and the same number if vids might be posted anytime, just of smaller tournaments, which may or may not be the case - well have to see how it all settles out.  In addition, store championship/regionals season is pretty long, so even if it is seasonal, I'd hate to have this happen a few months every year.  But it could be entirely as you predict - the New channels will settle down and it will be more reasonable even during champs/regionals, and will be perfectly ok during not champs/regionals.  Perhaps video creators could shed light - is the current production rate tied to regionals season/just getting started, or is it pretty normal per your plan?."
Netrunner,3aa40c,Krystman,7,Thu Jun 18 13:25:41 2015 UTC,"Our rate is the same as always. We have been posting a video every second day since a year or so and we plan to continue doing so. We are simply not posting all of the tournaments we've recorded anymore. And from the Regionals we probably won't have the time to post the Swiss rounds. Even with those restrictions, we still already have enough material to keep posting all the way to the Nationals and beyond. We will post excess material on our Patreon campaign page."
Netrunner,3aa40c,shammieg,4,Thu Jun 18 13:33:45 2015 UTC,"Personally, I've just always found it cool to see how other Netrunner metas play and take an interest in seeing the major tournaments from the different countries an areas.

In other words, I didn't want to suggest sanctioning certain people or that certain people were problems, I just wanted to open up a discussion about what could be done about the crowding of the subreddit, regardless of how it happens, because even if no single cause is causing it, the fact remains the crowding is there (in my eyes, others may think it's fine)"
Netrunner,3aa40c,nialbima,3,Thu Jun 18 13:59:19 2015 UTC,"I totally get where you're coming from, but I want to open up the possibility that it's not a very big issue.  There's an upside to having 1-2 fresh videos each day, and not a whole lot of downside.  It's not like some other submission types which can overwhelm a subreddit while not providing anything new (e.g. memes or ""look at the picture of these sets I bought"").  Each of these is high-quality (usually) original content.  For people who like watching matches occasionally, it's a good way to find them.  By following one of those links, it pretty much guarantees you won't be seeing something you've already watched.  That's a big upside over finding content with search engines or trying to subscribe to a bunch of youtube channels.  The downside is that there's only so much room on the homepage.  But /r/netrunner is a pretty slow-moving sub, so anything with upvotes is going to be easily visible for 24 hours.  With the current size of the community, I don't see any issue."

Netrunner,3aa40c,4thstringer,3,Thu Jun 18 14:04:39 2015 UTC,"First, genuinely sorry if I've crossed a line. I'm new to reddit and producing videos and I'm making it up as I go!  I have a large backlog - our (somewhat condensed) tournament season has finished in the UK - and am posting two videos a week and expect to do so for the foreseeable future. For what it's worth, when the backlog has died down, I definitely expect the release schedule to slow.  As others have commented, I think there are just a lot of video producers out there at the moment, but if the community comes to a conclusion on video posting etiquette, I'll stick to it."

If there were three pages worth of content cycling through here every day, I'd totally agree.  But people posting daily videos are like... half of the 15-20 new threads in each day.  New posts immediately shoot to the top of the sub, since they're pretty rare.  And video producers usually post one per day, max, since that's the best way to keep views and sanity.  I would be fine with a consolodated place, but as someone that likes to have all the new videos in one place, I would prefer if it wasn't a consolodated thread/set of threads - that's hard to keep track of what is new, and what isn't, Reddit isn't really designed to show off ""the most recent post by the OP in the comments section of a thread."""

They would be something along the lines of:   Ideally no more than one video posted per channel per day, with multiple videos organised into a self post or a YouTube playlist. Users who don't do this will be reminded through PM, rather than having content removed   Thoughts?"
Netrunner,3aa40c,apreche,8,Thu Jun 18 20:17:12 2015 UTC,If there is a post restriction I think it should be 2. As often people post both sides of a round of Swiss each day - so 2 makes sense.

Netrunner,3aa40c,Pricklyman,7,Thu Jun 18 20:27:23 2015 UTC,"As someone who makes videos (sorry, haven't done it in awhile!) I'll tell you the reason I posted one video at a time. It wasn't because I was trying to get extra karma. It wasn't because I was trying to get more traffic.  It's because I make one video at a time. If there is a tournament on say Sunday, and I actually produce the videos, I'll have one ready on maybe Tuesday, another Thursday, maybe another the week after. I imagine that people want to know about a video as soon as its ready, so I post right away. If I were to wait until I finished the last video from the tournament before making one big post, there would be this big gap where 90% of the tournament was live, but people who find videos via this sub wouldn't know about it yet."
Netrunner,3aa40c,Vysetron,3,Thu Jun 18 14:11:20 2015 UTC,"We could also put together an ""online now"" thread in the same vein as ""Card of the Day.""

Netrunner,3aa40c,Angry_Canadian_Sorry,3,Fri Jun 19 03:29:13 2015 UTC,"As someone who is a content creator - it depends on the format.  I'm just starting to upload the Adelaide Regionals videos, and I'm (planning on) releasing these once a week - one round (2 games) per week. So that's one video and one post. This was mainly to facilitate the live commentary better.  With previous and future GNK videos, I'm producing one game at a time, and planning on two games per week. (So two videos) I'm generally attempting to release these staggered through the week - if anything just to avoid saturation.  Generally speaking, editing, rendering and then uploading the videos takes a bunch of time, so essentially, if I want to post once for the Adelaide Regionals (for example) I'd have to wait two months - or post early, editing along the way. Either way it just inefficient, either to myself or to those interested.  I'll concede some very mild irritation at when people 'block post' like...3 videos at once, within a few minutes of each other. But again, it's a logistics thing. It's not that difficult for me to - if I'm not interested in watching the video - to just scroll past. It's no where near a big enough issue for me to care in any sense of the word.  Also as has (I'm sure - I haven't looked) been said - it's regionals season for a bunch of places. The Adelaide videos are going to be coming out - I believe Oxford and Toronto are rolling vids out, etc etc. Whilst I can say for a certainty that beyond unforseen difficulties, Adelaide will be rolling out a video a week - a lot of channels will be smashing out those Regional videos. Which is fine - Regionals always bring out those interesting match ups - the high level play and all the good stuff.  Also - it's nothing to do with karma - it's about how I think people are going to react. I'm relatively sure that if I amalgamate a tournament into one post with links, maybe the first video gets watched - then the grand finals - that's it. The entire middle order which I spent just as much time on - completely hosed.  I dunno, it's like midnight here and I'm just gushing.

He was disappointed when the game did not sell well, and initially blamed Magic's success and Wizards' inability to support two brands. Later on, Garfield started to suspect that the CCG format is not the right one for Netrunner, and now believes that FFG's LCG format is much more appropriate.  2) The game was ""Corp versus Runner"" from a very early stage of development.  That's about it. The rest of the interview is alright -- they talk about Hivemind, Garfield's new game, and some high-level discussion of design philosophy."

Not having 1 SEA would be (42x41x40x...x20)/(45x44x43x...x23) = ~10%, so you have a 90% chance to have 1 SEA in the top half of your deck. Likewise for SE.

So the numbers don't change."
Netrunner,3ab372,Andarel,2,Thu Jun 18 19:11:57 2015 UTC,"You are slightly incorrect here - the numbers used are the chances of AT LEAST one card in the top of the deck, so also include the possibility of there being two or three of that card in the top half.  So you can't just take the same probability for two plus  What you said would be correct If he had calculated the chance for exactly one and wanted the chance for exactly two, but that's not what happened."
Netrunner,3ab372,RestarttGaming,1 point,Thu Jun 18 19:17:58 2015 UTC,"Ah, yeah.  I only skimmed his math."
Netrunner,3ab372,Andarel,2,Thu Jun 18 19:24:15 2015 UTC,"You have roughly a 44% chance seeing  at least one sea and two scorched.  This assumes you've see 22 of a 44 card deck.  The chance of seeing at least one of each is around 78%  There is an 88% chance to see one or more of a card that you run 3 of.  This is found by finding the chance you'll find none of that card, and taking the opposite.  The chance you'll find none of the card is given by the chance you find a different card 22 times, so 41/44 * 40/43 * 39/42 ......*20/23.  This gives you roughly 11.6 percent you don't see any, so 88.4%chance you see at least one.  The chance of seeing at least two is a little easier.  There's a big math formula I can give you full of factorials that proves this, but the trick is that if you see exactly half the deck, and there are exactly 4 possible outcomes(0scorched, 1scorched, 2 scorched, 3scorched) in an evenly distributed probability curve like a shuffled deck, then there is a 50% chance you'll see the top two outcomes and a 50% chance you'll see the bottom 2.  2+ scorched is our top two, so there's a 50% chance we see it.  So if these two were completely independant We would just multiply them and get 88.4 *50 percent, or around 44 percent.  In reality these two are slightly related, as drawing a sea makes it less likely you drew a scorched, but with one out of 44 cards it's a small percentage not significantly worth calculating here.  For one of each the 50 just becomes another 88.4, so 88.42 is 78.1 percent ."
Netrunner,3ab372,RestarttGaming,2,Thu Jun 18 19:13:13 2015 UTC,"For one of each the 50 just becomes another 88.4, so 88.42 is 78.1 percent .   Good to see we came to about the same number. It's been a long time since I was in uni."
Netrunner,3ab372,BlueSapphyre,1 point,Thu Jun 18 19:24:10 2015 UTC,"Same, but I'm employed in a rather math heavy field so it keeps me up to date.  The difference in our numbers is purely rounding and the 44 vs 45 card assumption, the formulas used were the same ."
Netrunner,3ab372,RestarttGaming,1 point,Thu Jun 18 19:29:51 2015 UTC,"[...] the trick is that if you see exactly half the deck, and there are exactly 4 possible outcomes(0scorched, 1scorched, 2 scorched, 3scorched) in an evenly distributed probability curve like a shuffled deck, then there is a 50% chance you'll see the top two outcomes and a 50% chance you'll see the bottom 2. 2+ scorched is our top two, so there's a 50% chance we see it.   To elaborate on this: if you divide a deck with three Scorches into two, exactly one part will have at least two Scorches. When the two parts are equal-sized, their chances of being the ""lucky half"" must then be equal, so the chance is 50%."
Netrunner,3ab372,AnalysisSitus,1 point,Thu Jun 18 22:14:34 2015 UTC,"This is really simple problem for a quick approximation.  It's guaranteed that there are either 2+ Scorched in the top half of the deck, or 2+ in the bottom half but not both (that would be 4 Scorched).  So there's a 1/2 chance you get 2+ Scorched Earth in the first half of the deck.  Each individual Sea Source has a 50% chance to be drawn, so if you have 1, 2, or 3 copies, you have a 1/2, 3/4, or 7/8 chance to draw it.  Combining the two probabilities is just multiplication.  So, you have a 1/4, 3/8, or 7/16 chance of drawing that combo, depending on how many Sea Source you run."
Netrunner,3ab372,Glitch29,1 point,Thu Jun 18 20:19:52 2015 UTC,"I think probability goes out of the window because a dedicated Scorch deck will most likely keep a hand with combo pieces. It's the same with Punitive Counterstrike decks: The answer to the question ""will he be able to double Punitive?"" is ""yes"" far more often than a simple probability would permit."
Netrunner,3ab372,MrLabbes,1 point,Fri Jun 19 07:10:40 2015 UTC,"To estimate this, here's what I did:  There're 2-3 scorches on one half of your deck and 0-1 in the other. There's a 50% chance that the top half contains 2+ scorches and a 50% chance it contains less than 2. So there's always going to be a 50% chance that the top half contains more scorches than the bottom half (so, 2+). For SEA, there's a 1/2 chance for each one to be in one half of the deck. There's a 1/8 chance that all 3 are in the bottom half of the deck.  Combining these probabilities: there's a 1/2 * 7/8 chance that you have more scorches in the top AND there's at least one SEA in the top half of the deck as well. That's 7/16 ~ 44%.  This is an estimate, but I'd say it's quite accurate. Doesn't care about deck size either."
Netrunner,3ab372,RTsa,-1,Thu Jun 18 18:03:36 2015 UTC,"Assuming you have 49 cards in the deck, your odds of drawing a specific card is 3/49, or about 6%.  Of course, the odds go up every time you draw a card. You start with 6 cards in your hand. So, if you have none of the wanted cards in your hand, you have 3/43 (about 7%) odds to draw it. The odds go up every time you draw and don't see the card you want (3/42, 3/41, ...).  When you move into calculating the odds of getting two specific cards, it gets trickier than I can do."
Netrunner,3ab372,JohnQK,-2,Thu Jun 18 17:42:41 2015 UTC,"They're asking about one deck half, so the chances of finding a single specific card are 1/2. If there are three copies of that card, it's three times more likely to show up, so the chances are 5/6 (think 1/2 chance of failure is three times more likely, therefore failure is 1/6, success 5/6). The chances of finding one card of which there are three copies are 5/6, multiplied by the chances of finding the second card of which there three copies...  5/6 * 5/6 = 25/36 = 69%"

Setup a server that is whirlpool - shadow - shadow - shadow - cell portal - Akitaro Watanabe. When the runner runs it if they can't break anything they will continually go through the shadows giving 2 credits each and a tag. Then you rez the cell portal for 3 netting 3 credits and 3 tags each time they go through. Rinse and repeat. Because of the infinite loop ruling the corp has to end it at some point, but nothing says that number can't be a ridiculously obscene. Then of course you psychographics a Beale with that mole of cash and tags. It's a little bit of a cop out, but it works."

The only limit would be your willingness to play a number of turns approaching infinite turns. I'd recommend a computer player with x3 Levy University to accelerate the Data Raven installs, x3 Capital Investors as the corp econ, and Big Brother to add growth to the tags on the corp's turn. That way you can get through your turns as quickly as possible."

You can just have 1 GRNDL Refinery and recur it with Hades Fragment if you wanted to. 1 of Capital Investors should be enough since in the end game you'd probably have a spare click every turn or so, so you might as well have something to do with them.  The ice suite should be 3 Data Raven, 3 Matrix Analyzer, 3 Bandwidth to give you the most tags and the most advancement counters at the best price. 3 Bandwidth is optional."
Netrunner,3aa8ku,fdar,3,Thu Jun 18 14:07:21 2015 UTC,"You don't even need any tags/psychographics.  You have infinite turns, you can overadvance the old-fashioned way."
Netrunner,3aa8ku,rumirumirumirumi,1 point,Thu Jun 18 14:59:56 2015 UTC,"Certainly true, and the way we're setting up the runner's actions pretty much trivializes the question of maximizing points, but I think there is a considerable limit in how long a human is willing to click for credits and advance a Beale, and Psychographics helps maximize the point yield against that limit.  A more interesting question might be, now that we have infinite turns, how many turns would it take to get to 1000000 agenda points."

Netrunner,3aa8ku,RestarttGaming,3,Thu Jun 18 19:32:55 2015 UTC,"So the Corp wants 3x pad Campaign, 2x sundew, 3x mental health, 3x server diagnostics, and one grndl refinery.  They want to score a Hades shard.  They then want to create a server of three data ravens and three matrix analyzers and three shadows and three hunters and three gutenburgs and 3 virgo,followed by a pop up window.  The runner needs doppelganger and a data folding in play.  Every turn the Corp gains 16 and advances grndl refinery 3 times ( netting 3 credits per click, for an effective 25 credits per turn)  The runners turn is always gain one from data folding, run breaking pop-up for the extra Dopple run, then run 4 more times not breaking pop-up.  Every run nets the Corp 16 credits (counting the matrix advancing grndl as 3 credits per advance) and 21 tags .  This means 80 credits and 105  tags on the runners turn.  This means you can effictively gain 105 cash and give 105 tags per round for infinite rounds.  You can improve this a bit with more data folding /pop-up, and auto tag/click givers like Bernice , Josh b, John m, activist support, city surveillance, etc, but I got tired of doing th math and it's innfinite anyway so what's a few more per turn when your already doing 100+ tags and credits."

Even if the game is already decided on your part, its super rude to simply drop your hand and say the game is over.  Couple people have done that to me, and though I appreciate keeping the clock in mind, it leaves a sour taste in the mouth.  As far as yourself: 1.  Bring a Large Water bottle. 2.  Drink it. 3.  Hit the bathroom as soon as your games are over (nothing is worse than starting a round having to pee, knowing you had time to go, but chatted instead. 4.  Eat Breakfast 5.  Bring Snacks. 6.  Figure out where you'll be getting food at your break BEFORE the tourney. 7.  Prepare for a mentally/emotionally exhausted drive home.  Seriously, I almost killed a car full of friends because I neglected to realize how brain beaten I would be post Store Champs on a long drive home."
Netrunner,3aa1u4,jottootts,2,Thu Jun 18 16:47:13 2015 UTC,"This.   I've been playing tournaments for different games since I was 15 (damn more than 10 years now). I've lost count the amount of times I've won games just because of the simple fact I remembered to take drinks and food with me.   Simple rules that have worked for me: 1: 1/2 liter water bottle at least. When its your turn. Take a sip. It helps refresh your brain or at least give the pavlov effect after awhile. I wouldn't recommend sugery drinks. For starters because they ain't healthy, but also because of the fact a crash after a suger rush can be really bad for your thought process.   2: Eat at least something every 2 hours. For me, fruit works best, but I'm a health nut. Every 2 hours an apple or banana. It works fast, it's healthy and its super easy and fast to eat. I would also recommend Snickers if you want something more filling. Or a peanut butter sandwich ( or some really good farmers cheese)  3: Even better is something you can easily eat during or quickly in between games. For the past few years I've also been taking trailmix with me. So this means a mix of: a general assortment of nuts (i prefer unsalted), raisins, seeds (pumpkin or sunflower) and M&M's. This generally gives you everything you need in a simple mix (from fast sugars from chocolate to more slow burnings energy from the nuts). Constantly munching on something small is better then big bites after awhile and getting hungry inbetween.   Nutrition and games are important people!!  Last note: coffee and caffeine work really well for a quick wake up, but remember coffee can really dehydrate you. So drink water after, especially in the summer!"

This in combination with the intense concentration needed for Netrunner can cause Tournament Headache. I make sure to have some OTC painkillers with me just in case. It would suck to suffer through the tournament with a headache, or to have to run to the drugstore during the tourney."

However the whole way through something was bugging me about your commentary and it wasn't until the end that I think I realized what it was.

Netrunner,3a8gzm,The_Calamity_,3,Fri Jun 19 06:37:12 2015 UTC,Something something it's live and I didn't have a partner. I just sorta gush - it's probably a fair piece of criticism to be honest. (I haven't exactly listened to the whole thing back!)  Repeating one self is so much easier to avoid when you have a partner to move things forward. I guess you'll be looking forward to the elimination cut games - where I managed to get someone in for each one!
Netrunner,3a8um0,shammieg,2,Thu Jun 18 03:38:18 2015 UTC,"I'm still new to this game, but I'm very happy you go so in-depth about what's actually happening and that you say the names of the cards out loud (for those of us who dont have the art or cards memorized yet.)

Netrunner,3a8um0,chantc,1 point,Thu Jun 18 15:12:23 2015 UTC,"Another user said this, but if you wanted to go an extra mile in editing, you can flash the art of the card on the screen for a second or so, so that I can pause and read the card. Also, it's mentioned a few times some ideas about the Toronto meta, but if you could maybe give even more insight turn to turn why a player is doing a specific thing (ie why getting more credits, why playing x card), and maybe an early overview of what you think the decks and the Identities try to accomplish, it would help new players learn a lot about the game. Also pointing out neat tricks is really helpful (for example, I learned from one of the other videos that running Dirty Laundry on an empty Archives is a nice quick cash boost!)  Thanks again for the great video! :)"

Netrunner,3a8um0,chantc,1 point,Thu Jun 18 15:10:46 2015 UTC,"The amount of overlays, card images, credit count etc. you add to a video seriously effects how long it takes to get them out. The more of this you add the more likely the videos will be less current. If you are interested in a channel that adds all of the cards and does credit counts ect. check out neoreading grid. I think these videos are great for beginners due to the on screen info... But as mentioned they lag a little more behind the meta than these so its a give and take with youtube videos :)."

Netrunner,3a8um0,chantc,1 point,Thu Jun 18 21:37:41 2015 UTC,"I like the videos a lot - commentary stays on point, good at keeping a balance between color commentary and play-by-play, staying focused.  Since you're asking for input, something that's simple to do and really helps a lot is add credit counts to your display.  Not always easy to determine, I know, but it makes it so much easier to figure out why people are doing what they're doing if you can see that info.  Bonus if you add tags and bad pub, but that's more sugar-coating than necessity."

Netrunner,3a8xuc,TonyStellato,1 point,Thu Jun 18 20:42:17 2015 UTC,"The second game didn't feel that way on the day, but I think I need to work on my own mental fortitude. I think the first one put me a little bit on tilt, and looking on it again I was flailing a bit on the last few turns. I didn't quite realize I had the chance that I did on the 2nd last turn, I was just running HQ a bit haphazardly. That last eli/turing play was really good; the way that you seem to prefer rezzing the turing on final, last ditch runs seems to be the best time to do it against shapers who use Atman a lot"
Netrunner,3a8xuc,Mo0man,1 point,Thu Jun 18 21:04:05 2015 UTC,"But more seriously, the second game looked a lot closer from this angle than I did from where I was sitting. It certainly didn't feel that way.  Anyway, it seems like I got a little tunnel visioned on that second last turn. When he installed and I stole that undefended ABT, I knew he was pretty flooded, but really I should have let him stay flooded and built up instead. Installing that Atman, running Hq, stealing that NAPD spent all my cash and gave him that window for him to push out that prireq. If I just sat and tried for the r&d lock to prevent any Jackson's, I probably could have locked down his remote server.  I was not thinking that either of us had a chance at a win in the next couple of turns(I was expecting to grab another 2 pointer or something), but when I installed and ran using that Atman, I gave both of us that opportunity.   Regarding the first game... Well, it was probably more a factor of my being a bit reckless against Tony's Andy. The first turn attempted astro and undefended HQ was a result of me planning things out halfway and not executing properly because... Well, not sure. Maybe I was just a bit tired on the day?   It was an unmulliganed first hand, and was iceless, but also it was agendaless, and had a sansan that I thought could be used to drop all my money in if he tried for the siphon. So I clicked for a credit, installed the virus suite, drawing the astro for the neh draw. Instead of carrying out my entire plan and just letting the 1/5 access for astro happen if he tried the siphon, I chickened out and installed the astro because I didn't think Andy would check first turn. Obviously that got punished, and things went worse from there.   The second astro steal (from the inside job) was a result of   a) thinking that Inside Jobs weren't popular anymore b) trying to sort of mindgame Tony. He knew, or at least assumed it was a sansan, plus he saw that I drew into both a biotic and a shipment, so I was able to FA the astro that turn. Didn't work though.  In terms of more general mistakes I made, I probably should have been aggressively Jackson drawing instead of  using my NEH ability to install otherwise useless things (like the cyber dex suites), or clicking for credits to rez the DBS I would later install  Tl;Dr: be very aware of when you're giving away scoring windows, and make a plan for your turn and follow through. Also, try not to panic."

Netrunner,3a8c9n,Glitch29,2,Thu Jun 18 03:50:17 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's hard to make the ID do work for you. The decks where Stronger Together seems to pull some weight go really deep on the click-denial strategy with ELP, Heinlein Grid, Turing, maybe even Ruhr Valley. I'm not saying those are strong decks overall, but by minimizing the runner's ability to click through they at least make the strength boost come into play."
Netrunner,3a8c9n,Recamen,2,Thu Jun 18 04:31:41 2015 UTC,"What concerned me about the full-blown click denial strategy was money. A lot of these anti-click countermeasures work best in the early game, and regardless of my build, I struggle to find a good early game momentum with stronger together. Hence the reason why I settled for a more passive click-constraint approach (mainly heinlein, caprice, and brain taping warehouse). The runner's willingness to check my many remotes helps with that too."
Netrunner,3a8c9n,MrLordcaptain,1 point,Thu Jun 18 12:24:13 2015 UTC,Thanks!   I was wondering how effective this deck would be in EtF. Architect could really make the Econ engine run a little faster.
Netrunner,3a8c9n,MrLordcaptain,2,Thu Jun 18 13:47:33 2015 UTC,"Econ looks sufficient. In fact, you actually might've gone overboard. You've got like, 19-20 cards dedicated to econ. Unless you're running 3x Janus in there (in which case you call the deck ""Goldeneye""), I'd cut a few.  Also, you need a few non-bioroids to throw a curveball into the works. Otherwise, until you get a duet out on a server, the Runner can just run 'til the biocows come home. I'll vouch for Fenris. You get a bad pub, yes, but it's sooo delicious to watch a Runner facecheck into a brain damage. Also, consider Inazuma, since one of the benefits of Bioroids under Stronger Together is that you ain't trashing these bad boys. Unless you've got cutlery, that is. Imagine trapping a Runner directly into a Heimdall 2.0 - or better yet, a Janus!  Also, consider a trap or two. Jinteki's the King of traps, but HB can throw its weight around with Secretary or Overwriter."
Netrunner,3a8c9n,teky-gaming,2,Thu Jun 18 22:01:55 2015 UTC,"I played something like this a while ago, around when H&P hit the shelfs. I found that in order to get the weak econ of ST going you need some rush ice. I used quandary and paper wall to get my eves and adonis running. Also I think that the ability is the strongest on cheap bioroids like eli and viktor and not very good with wotan and heimdall.  Is it working for you? Is Heinlein grid and B-T warehouse enough to get rolling in the early game?"

Netrunner,3a6115,PaxCecilia,2,Wed Jun 17 19:09:28 2015 UTC,"Right but my point is that the stealth credits used to add strength aren't 'real' credits in the sense that you can't use them for anything but their intended purpose.  So say you have Refractor and 2 Lockpicks. All you need is 2 real credits to break the two end the run subroutines, and you'll access the server with 5 credits remaining.   And obviously having real credits can be useful in some situations and shit in others. If you need run more than once, it sucks because now you have no stealth credits to boost strength... but if you need some money to play more parts of your rig, well you just successfully ran the server and ended it with more money than you started :)  edit: I just noticed you wrote this above   Refractor gets through this for +1 cred, potentially more if you're using Lockpicks/Cloak.   Emphasis mine. Refractor can only get through this if you're using Lockpicks/Cloak (technically you could do some fantastic Dinosaurus+Personal Touch+Net Ready Eyes+Datasucker jank). You can only boost strength with stealth credits."
Netrunner,3a6115,unitled,1 point,Wed Jun 17 19:29:15 2015 UTC,"Yes! For sure, you can translate stealth credits into real credits with this card, which is pretty horrible for the corp! I'd just chuck this if I got it in my hand against Kit, not even worth the install."
Netrunner,3a6115,Bwob,6,Wed Jun 17 22:53:48 2015 UTC,"People look at this and think ""oh lame, with the giant refund, gordian blade breaks it for 7, and gets 5 back, so it only costs you 2.  Lame.  Why would I pay 5 for a codegate that only costs the runner 2?""  The answer is that it doesn't JUST cost the runner 2c.  7c with a 5c rebate is not the same as 2c, because it requires the runner to have the 7c on hand in the first place.  Having one of these on the board basically ties up 5 of the runner's credits in a ""Engine Fund"" that they can't spend, or else they stop being able to get through.  (Also, as many have noted, it's pretty annoying for folks who are trying to use yog as their only decoder, net-read-eyes or no)"

Netrunner,3a6115,Bwob,3,Thu Jun 18 01:44:35 2015 UTC,"If the runner is willing to invest in an order-dependent 4-card combo, then I'm willing to let that invalidate a piece of ice in my deck.  It's not like I'd be rezzing any OTHER codegates in that case either. :P"
Netrunner,3a6115,kirklanda,2,Thu Jun 18 03:22:29 2015 UTC,"This is actually one of the best code gates to use against yog.0. They need to spend 3 sucker tokens and NRE or 4 sucker tokens otherwise, which means it's absolutely doing its job as a gear check, and quite a big one, too. The real problem, as someone else pointed out, is refractor."
Netrunner,3a6115,llama66613,1 point,Thu Jun 18 07:07:22 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I agree. I just think it's funny that if Yog.0 does manage to make it through, it will earn you serious dough."

Yes it only costs someone with a gordian blade 2 credits to break, but they've got to have 7 credits in the first place to do it.    Imagine the runner has 7 credits.  They get through.  ONCE.  If you have a caprice or ash they can't get through until they find 2 more credits.  It's a pretty strong effect.  Of course, if you see a stealth refractor deck it'll really ruin your day.  Now they're running it at a profit."

Netrunner,3a6115,omgitsblake,2,Wed Jun 17 21:43:53 2015 UTC,"Slightly against the grain I think this is great ICE.  I never see anyone complain about wraparound or quandary for being early game ICE, which is what this is.    Decks that I would include this in don't care about the fact that it'll give them credits by the time they get their stealth rig set up or they have enough sucker tokens to yog it because I'll have scored out long before then."
Netrunner,3a6115,BlueSapphyre,6,Wed Jun 17 16:08:02 2015 UTC,"I never see anyone complain about wraparound or quandary for being early game ICE, which is what this is.   5 rez cost is a bit steep to consider it an early game ice. But it lasts well into the mid game, whereas wraparound and quandary do not."
Netrunner,3a6115,CoolIdeasClub,2,Wed Jun 17 16:31:58 2015 UTC,Comparing this to Quandary or Wraparound is weird because those ice cost 1 and 2 credits respectively.
Netrunner,3a6115,omgitsblake,3,Wed Jun 17 16:33:15 2015 UTC,I'm not really comparing the cost so much as I'm comparing them as checks: Quandary and Wraparound are gear checks whereas Little Engine is a credit check.
Netrunner,3a6115,djc6535,3,Wed Jun 17 17:00:44 2015 UTC,"I'm not really comparing the cost so much as I'm comparing them as checks   Which is a mistake.  The common theme with 'check' ice is that it is cheap.  It needs to be cheap to be an effective early game ice.  If you're saying you don't see people complaining about wraparound and quandary for being early ice and they are complaining about this one it's because early ice needs to be cheap, which this isn't, which makes it bad early ice.  At it's best, it's mediocre mid-game ice.  It's too expensive to be early ice, and as a non-taxing check ice, it can't be late game ice.  Midgame, the runner is reasonably likely to have both the gear and the credits to get through, which is why it's only mediocre there."
Netrunner,3a6115,CoolIdeasClub,1 point,Wed Jun 17 19:42:36 2015 UTC,My point was that 5 cost ice aren't early game ice. Not unless they are doing something nasty like Komainu or Architect

So if this is the outermost piece of ice on a server, and I have my standard rig up (Chaos Theory, Toolbox, Sage, Creeper, Memstrips, E3 Feedback Implants), then this is like a super-Opus. Of course, I just mentioned 23 credits' worth of hardware and programs, so maybe it's not really that much of a ""steal"", as it were..."

Netrunner,3a6115,X-factor103,2,Wed Jun 17 19:35:03 2015 UTC,"I think the closest equivalent to it is Hive but there's nothing quite like it.  Basically, what Little Engine offers is the stopping effect of Tollbooth without the taxing. If you are playing fast and rely on keeping the Runner poor then it's a better fit for the slot because those 3 credits go a long way.  For example, it's unlikely the Runner will be able to get through it after trashing a SanSan or stealing an NAPD. It won't save you from Medium, but it's there and it's annoying which I fairly like.  I think people won't test it enough for it to shine, but I think it's a good card that should find itself in a bunch of decks."
Netrunner,3a6115,Sir_Selah,1 point,Wed Jun 17 21:49:46 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure how I feel about this card. It's good...until it isn't. Which is a lot of ICE, really. It is good value at first for what it does for the runner: hard to break, decent early-mid game ICE. But as soon as the runner is able to break it, it's just a money check. If the runner has at least X credits, they will be able to get through and make most of it back.  I suppose the place of this ICE is innermost on a server. If you can rez some surprising tax on the 2nd or 3rd pieces of ICE on the server, they'll no longer have the cash to get through when they hit the Engine. So...play early game to stop them, then layer with more heavily taxing ICE to keep stopping them?  Still not sure if I like this one or not. It's interesting though, and I applaud the design of this card for being, at this point, unique."
Netrunner,3a6115,X-factor103,2,Wed Jun 17 15:41:03 2015 UTC,One could also install over this card once its served its purpose.
Netrunner,3a6115,cdwols,2,Wed Jun 17 16:05:33 2015 UTC,"True. But at rez cost 5, that's something of a loss for most ICE that's going over it.  This is either one of those cards that everyone figured out before it hit the table (early ETR, late game money check), or a sleeper that no one really realizes the full potential of until it's played a ton. Really hard to say which it is right now."

The point is that you can probably put down an agenda behind this and score in the early game against Anarch.  Just like with Lotus Field, you pay a premium for that, since the cheap gear-checks (Quandary, Enigma) are a little too vulnerable to Parasite to allow you to reliably punish the weak Anarch early game."
Netrunner,3a6115,neutronicus,1 point,Wed Jun 17 22:11:04 2015 UTC,"I'd rather run Wraparound. Scoring out an early Astro behind a Wrap is much easier, as it doesn't rely on you having an economy card to do it as well."
Netrunner,3a6115,PanzerD,1 point,Wed Jun 17 22:33:26 2015 UTC,I mean 3x Wraparound is a given.  This is just another breaker they can't use Parasite instead of finding (and if I'm Anarch I'm definitely keeping a hand with Corroder in it against NBN).
Netrunner,3a6115,Zouavez,1 point,Wed Jun 17 22:48:49 2015 UTC,I can see this piece of ICE being paired with Midway Station Grid.
Netrunner,3a6115,thesreynatwork,1 point,Wed Jun 17 20:41:00 2015 UTC,Why? They only have to break 2 subs.
Netrunner,3a6115,PanzerD,2,Wed Jun 17 20:49:03 2015 UTC,"It increases the upkeep cost for the Runner to break it, which is arguably what this ICE is designed to be. Obviously it only increases it by 2 credits, but this means that a Runner with Gordian Blade needs 9 credits to break through. Yes, this ultimately only costs them 4, but it is interesting as a piece of ICE that forces a credit-check on the Runner.  I don't think that makes it playable. Yog + Parasite ends up netting the Runner 25 credits, less anything else on the server, and Knight straight up breaks this for a profit, requiring only an initial investment of 4.  Maybe this will have a good place when Data and Destiny comes out."

I was playing in a tournament on the weekend and my opponent was running this while I was running Headlock Reina with Desperado.  NORMALLY I'd have to make do without putting a Magnum Opus in my deck, because the MU is tight and the influence is pretty much stuck on burst or the ability to run heavily for cash.  Thanks to my opponent, I was able to put a Knight on Little Engine and run his empty-except-for-this-ICE server as a Do-it-not-really-yourself-thanks-corp Opus! AND I got to play with 17 influence! I thought I was going to get a judge called on me!  10/10 would play against again."
Netrunner,3a6115,thesreynatwork,1 point,Wed Jun 17 21:23:54 2015 UTC,"why wouldn't he kill that server immediately? If it is the only piece of Ice, and their is a knight there.....seems like a must trash?"
Netrunner,3a6115,breakfastcandy,1 point,Wed Jun 17 22:19:41 2015 UTC,"He absolutely should have, but instead he put a second piece of ICE in front of it.  I just sighed at the loss of my free Opus and continued to run rampant on his centrals.  He was an alright player, but this was a massive oversight on his part. He actually said to me ""Hmm, do I need to overwrite that Knight? No, it's not an Opus for you, since you only get one credit per click."" I don't think he realised the Desperado was there and I was just like ""Yeah...."" He continued to put assets behind it which I was more than happy to trash. By the time he realised I was getting two credits per run and put his other ICE down I was tromping everywhere.  This is not the typical case for this card. Most people will recognise when it sucks and to get rid of it. I just wanted to share my funny anecdote."
Netrunner,3a6115,firefrenchy,1 point,Wed Jun 17 22:31:19 2015 UTC,"It's mid price early game ice, like Hive is. The 2c or so it will end up costing rhe runner after rhey have their breaker up is a minor tax, but considering what Engine offers is still a nice perk. The great thing about Engine is it requires the runner to keep their credits high in order to continually get through, so every install or run on a different server could turn Engine back on. And every ice you put in front of it raises the credit reserve they need even more.  It's also an ice you can score behind early, since installing the correct breaker can leave the runner too poor to break if their economy isn't up yet."
Netrunner,3a6115,mrteecanada1212,1 point,Wed Jun 17 21:24:27 2015 UTC,"I think this one is always going to be an ice people need to keep an eye out for. With 2 influence it might be a bit much to put in blue sun over the amazing tollbooth, but otherwise it would definitely be good in that deck, as you can rearrange your servers and ice, and you would usually want this to be the last ice the runner has to pass. I have used it in NEH in practice games and it worked pretty well, and at 5 credits it's not hard to rez, so you can make it your first ice on R&D and stack a pop-up in front of it soon after, and voila, you've got yourelf a fairly secure server. But yeah."

Hell, they have a card that instantly sets your credit count to 0. Needing to have 7 or whatever credits to get past this isn't that easy against the right deck.  Unless you're playing stealth, and you run all over this, and gain heaps of money, and generally have a good time."

Go ahead and make a few legal decks from scratch, starting with corp (there are more constraints to a corp deck, so you have more structure). Turn to the deckbuilding page of the rulebook and follow the rules for making a deck.  Your deck will undoubtedly be terrible, but you should play with it a game or two in any case. You will hear yourself saying ""Why on earth did I put this card in?"" and ""I could have sworn there was another copy of this in here..."" or ""Can't I mulligan just once more?""

But if you're asking about the ""best"" method, be aware that you will probably become a more competitive player (and a more competitive deckbuilder! ) more quickly if you start with good decks that other people have built, and only start tweaking them once you understand them and have the fundamentals down."
Netrunner,3a6pb2,rumirumirumirumi,2,Thu Jun 18 13:40:29 2015 UTC,"Just adding in the new cards will make your decks unwieldy, and probably illegal for the corps, where the agenda points/total cards are important. Searching for extant decks on Netrunnerdb is good for getting ideas, but honestly once you've gotten a few games under your belt I'd suggest just jumping in and giving it a shot. You'll be playing against people of similar skill/experience, so it's less crucial to build something good than if you're going out into the wild. When I first started playing my girlfriend and I would just each take one of the sides and throw a deck together on the fly and then play them, which is much more feasible when you have such a limited card pool. Try to spend all of your influence, bringing in cards from the other factions that do things you can't do natively (or do them way better), or just that you like!"
Netrunner,3a6pb2,m50d,2,Wed Jun 17 20:05:05 2015 UTC,"My girlfriend and I are still pretty new, but we've played maybe 40-50 games and have been into building our own decks since the beginning 'cause it's more fun that way.  This guide by Team Covenant was super useful to us when we first started building decks. It's full of great advice on how to balance your cards for both corp and runner to have a decent deck.  As others have said, your first couple decks will suck, but that's okay! What I recommend is this: build a deck, play it 1-5 times, then tweak it, and keep doing that til you have something decent, and then play it til you're sick of it. It's important not to tweak too often because you don't really know what's wrong or right with a deck until you play with it a fair few times, but at the same time there will be some things you will notice (like ""oh god why did I include THIS card??"") that just need to be changed right away to make the deck worthwhile.  Once you've played a deck until you can't stand the thought of playing that same deck again, record it into NetrunnerDB (if you want to be able to rebuild it later) and then start the process over again.  Only worry about being competitive if that's something you care about, if you just want to play casually and build decks 'cause it's fun, don't let anything stop you! Just know that you are going to build some decks that will be terrible (at least on the first pass), and that's okay!"
Netrunner,3a6pb2,t-lor,0,Thu Jun 18 15:06:33 2015 UTC,Good link.
Netrunner,3a6oek,bleuchz,11,Wed Jun 17 17:28:31 2015 UTC,"For deck ideas definitely check out NetrunnerDB. For some of the all-time greats check out the Hall of Fame. They aren't all just competitive. Some of them are either fun to play or have a funny description or story.  As far as ""Tips & Tricks"" there's a few tips I like to give new players.  Corp: ""Feeling"" and knowing a deck is huge. Understanding the tempo and overall strategy of your deck is necessary. Too often new players, admittedly this has happened to me, will ""net-deck"" a popular/successful Corp deck, play it once or twice and say ""This deck is awful! How did XXX win a Regional with this?!"" They won because they knew every card in their deck and understood why each and every card was in that deck by tweaking it for hours upon hours. Also, you'll see a lot of people reference the phrase ""Scoring Window"". A scoring window is a window of opportunity when the Runner is unlikely to be able to complete a run on their following turn because they are low on money, have money but don't have the breaker they need, etc. Learn to identify those windows and take advantage of them  Runner: Accesses win games. Too often people will have tunnel vision about building their rig, only running when they have multi access cards, etc. Don't be blinded. If the corp doesn't ice R&D, run it. The agendas have to be somewhere. The other tip I like to give new players is: It's never as bad as it seems. You may take some brain damage, you may lose half your rig but people who have played this game a lot always have stories about how the game came down to accessing one card or winning one psi-game. Whatever happens just. keep. running.  Overall: Practice. Just like anything, the more games you play the better you will understand the game, the more games you will win.   Last thing: Netrunner is hard. Don't get discouraged. Everyone goes through losing streaks, everyone gets screwed by agenda flood, or not drawing their economy, it happens. Keep your head up and keep running."
Netrunner,3a6oek,ElderMason,3,Wed Jun 17 20:33:48 2015 UTC,Thanks so much for this!
Netrunner,3a6oek,Horse625,3,Wed Jun 17 20:40:28 2015 UTC,"My running game got ten times better on the day that I realized that I'm not gonna lose (much) by face checking ice, and that I don't have to have a full rig out to be safe.  It's okay to run into some ice.  You're still making the corp spend money, as well as learning valuable information about what you need right now to get through it.  Typical corp first turn is ice HQ, ice R&D, and do something else like Hedge Fund, Sweeps, or maybe throw down an asset (probably PAD Campaign or Daily Business Show).  So my typical first turn usually involves running HQ and R&D just to get them to spend money."
Netrunner,3a6oek,allemagne,4,Thu Jun 18 10:45:35 2015 UTC,"When I started playing, I was given ten words to be a good Runner:  Run often. Don't carry tags. Play Criminal. Trash yellow cards.  Criminals, of course, are suffering in the current meta. NoiseShop is a good deck to start with. I'd also play a variant of Big Rig Shaper, and I'd try out MaxX; she's a ton of fun to pilot. I'd also argue that playing Street Chess is an experience every Netrunner should have. It's my all-time favorite deck and I took it to Detroit regionals this year :D  If you want decklists for any of these, let me know and I'll post them."
Netrunner,3a6oek,allemagne,1 point,Wed Jun 17 20:23:03 2015 UTC,I would for sure like a list for a shaper deck. Crim for whatever reason doesn't pique my interest. Also any advice on Corp decks to look at?   The chess breakers are a low priority for me. I take it it's not a shift in meta so much as Corp being able to play around it now?
Netrunner,3a6oek,BlueSapphyre,1 point,Wed Jun 17 20:25:52 2015 UTC,"Street Chess actually uses a neat combo which is Scheherazade + Pawn + Deep Red to draw cards & gain credits on successful runs.

Crims were good against fast decks like NEH FA, but stalled out late game. Since Clot, we've seen less FA builds and more glacier builds which grind out the runner. Which means you need better econ, so PPVP Kate has risen to the top, and Whizzard/MaxX because of their good match up against RP."

But Clot stops this by not being able to score agendas the turn you install them, so they kind of waned (they're still around though, just not as many). Jinteki Replicating Perfection is the current corp hotness due to their ice being really good/taxing and their agendas being hard to steal. Prepaid VoicePad Kate has incredible burst economy due to the ppvps giving a discount on them, plus shaper breakers are really efficient."

Netrunner,3a5rhj,derHoppi,62,Wed Jun 17 13:16:11 2015 UTC,"The corp doesn't ""get"" to mulligan first, it's a disadvantage forced upon them.   nor can I imagine any situation in which my mulligan would depend on whether my opponent mulligans or not.   As players start to improve at the game and play at a high skill level, especially in tournaments, this definitely factors into the decision making.  A corp that keeps their hand has at least a decent hand and is less likely to be agenda flooded, and probably has a piece of economy and at least 1-2 pieces of ice.  Basically, it's good enough to keep, so it's not terrible    A corp that mulligans may end up with an AWFUL hand, or at least considerable weakness in their plan.  So while i probably wouldn't keep a hand of medium, legwork, and 3 really expensive cards i can't play anytime soon normally, if the corp mulligans i may consider it, as it's much less likely they have what they need, and they may leave an early opening i can exploit (not enough ice to cover both HQ and R&D, or not enough money to rez both, or a lot of agendas, etc)  You'll pretty much never be disqualified for announcing your mulligan first as the runner, it's basically just giving up an advantage, as now the corp knows you have a weak hand you're giving up, so they can accept a slightly weak but not terrible hand they were considering mulliganing, knowing it's going to be less likely you as the runner have a strong start."
Netrunner,3a5rhj,RestarttGaming,5,Wed Jun 17 13:29:01 2015 UTC,"This mulligan strategy was a problem in competitive Hearthstone for a while. Both players choose to mulligan at the same time, but you can see your opponent doing it if you were still deciding. So in a lot of games, both players would refuse to mulligan until the end of the 30-45 seconds that the game gives you to decide."
Netrunner,3a5rhj,Mountebank,3,Wed Jun 17 16:57:11 2015 UTC,"Part of why it's important to have a decided order.  This strategy doesn't make sense if you know you're the first player to mull.  Luckily, this dumb practice never really caught on in Hearthstone, but it'd be easy enough to fix with programming."

Netrunner,3a5rhj,Stonar,2,Thu Jun 18 21:54:41 2015 UTC,"Calling me not competetive isn't quite accurate, I'm just fairly inexperienced in Netrunner. I'm trying to play more often, but the meta here meets every 2-3 weeks, and mostly on weekdays. Then my real life gets in the way :). I sometimes play with colleagues at work, but they don't own any cards, so they have to borrow my decks, which doesn't give me the opportunity to learn anything about the game's dynamics."
Netrunner,3a5rhj,Glitch29,1 point,Fri Jun 19 05:52:20 2015 UTC,I assumed that was still a problem.  I'm glad to hear you use the past tense.  Maybe Blizzard hired some more software engineers if they're starting to address the public's complaints.
Netrunner,3a5rhj,X-factor103,3,Sat Jun 20 01:41:15 2015 UTC,"This is a great reply. I'm going to add to the other side of this, whether or not the other person's decision influences mine to take a mulligan or not.  In short, it doesn't much change my own mind. Even if the corp gets to mulligan first and gets info on my old hand, when I draw up again they won't have much idea how good a hand I have until we start playing. And if the corp thinks they have a window to rush score against me, they might even be walking into a trap where I surprise tutor and run them easily (I play Shaper, so this could happen at any time).  I don't let what I think my opponent might think influence whether I actually mulligan or not. I have decks (both runner and corp) that are designed to do certain things. If I don't think I can manage a decent start, I'll mulligan knowing that I'm not likely to get a hand worse than the one I already had. If my corp opponent mulligans before me, it almost never changes my own decision to swap out my hand or not.  tl;dr even if my opponent tips me off that their start hand isn't great, when they take a new one it might not be great still, or it could be fine. Info gained is less useful. And given the chance to match my starting bad hand against their bad hand, I'd rather take the chance of starting with my good hand vs their bad hand."
Netrunner,3a5rhj,RestarttGaming,2,Wed Jun 17 14:28:16 2015 UTC,"That brings up another good point - the Mulligan information is more useful to some decks and playstyles than others.  A deck that has a very specific game plan they want to do every game, with a lot of combos, is less likely to be influenced by an opponents Mulligan.   A very fluid and opportunistic deck that tries to play fast and respond to the corps moves, mitigating their strengths and attacking weakness, might be very influenced.  There's no hard and fast rule for a lot of this stuff, so you'll discover what works for you by testing it out, seeing what high level players do, and just playing a lot more"
Netrunner,3a5rhj,StabbyJim,1 point,Wed Jun 17 16:26:31 2015 UTC,"That's why I stated that, normally, the other player's decision doesn't influence my own. I mostly like to build and / or play decks that have a clear strategy and a central theme (and I've done so since my Magic days many a moon ago). Perhaps I just need more experience, I rarely have the time / people needed to play, the meta is really small where I live."
Netrunner,3a5rhj,RestarttGaming,1 point,Thu Jun 18 06:09:43 2015 UTC,I'm still not quite understanding why they would be getting a worse hand after a mulligan. It seems they'd have a better if not equal chance to have a good hand. Wouldn't the best strategy be to mulligan every time unless you have a fairly strong hand? (Very new to netrunner)
Netrunner,3a5rhj,unitled,1 point,Fri Jun 19 05:44:01 2015 UTC,"They're not getting a worse hand.  Technically if they take a mulligan they have the exact same chance at any given hand.  The thing is, - lets say you only mulligan the worst 20% of hands.  If you keep, you're telling your opponent that the hand you have isn't in that worst 20%.  Therefore, your hand is in the top 80%.  Taking a mulligan opens you up to the full 100% again.  You have the same chance of any given hand as you did originally, but now you might also have something in that worst 20% that you wouldn't have had if you kept.  So an opponent that keeps is working with a hand from the top 80%, but an opponent that mulligans is working from the full range.  In other words, it's not that a hand you mulligan is any worse - on average it's the same.  But it has the potential to be worse - a hand thats kept will never be in the ""absolute terrible"" category that a mulligan'd hand might be."
Netrunner,3a5rhj,dshirle7,1 point,Fri Jun 19 06:00:11 2015 UTC,"Who mulligans first is always something either tied to who goes first (which is random) or randomly determined itself. By making it one or the other of the players, they've eliminated the random element from the beginning of the game (aside from which side you play first, but this is often irrelevant).  It can make a very slight difference... If I as a runner have a hand that is BORDERLINE mulligan, it's good to see what the corp does with their hand as I know they are a) less likely to have an ideal hand if they keep and b) more likely to have a disastrous hand if they've mulliganed.  As to why corp first... Guess it's just because they get first turn."
Netrunner,3a5rhj,ninjakitty4001,1 point,Wed Jun 17 13:22:40 2015 UTC,"The Corp just decides first because somebody has to decide first. It's not a benefit; the Runner has the advantage, getting to decide whether to mulligan with the knowledge of what the Corp is doing. I don't think Runner announcing first would disqualify you in a tournament, but you shouldn't do it because you're forfeiting an advantage (albeit a tiny one).  I also play Magic, in which the player who is playing first (which is an advantage) has to announce mulligan decisions first each time. It matters even more for Magic, because each time you mulligan, you draw one fewer card. The other player then gets to know the other player will be down a card, which can tip the scales on whether to keep or mulligan.  It's worth noting, you mulligan at the same time. One person just has to announce first."
Netrunner,3a5rhj,raydenuni,1 point,Wed Jun 17 13:30:28 2015 UTC,"I have to agree about Magic and I really, really like that I can mulligan for free in Netrunner (but only once - I could mulligan away my whole hand in Magic). I'm not really sure if it really is an advantage to play first in Magic - unless you plan to play creatures with haste. I'd say it is a disadvantage because your opponent sees what you played and can react accordingly, plus he is allowed to draw on his first turn, you're not. But I have to say that I haven't touched Magic in a long, long time, I stopped playing after 8th Edition ;)"
Netrunner,3a5rhj,dshirle7,2,Thu Jun 18 06:26:06 2015 UTC,"I'm not really sure if it really is an advantage to play first in Magic   It's (usually) a huge advantage...you get to react to their cards with x+1 amount of mana. e.g. they play a 3 drop & you can counter it with a 4 cost spell. They have to go like for like.  That's why Hearthstone has the coin, because it gives player 2 one turn of being the leader."

Also you could post on boardgamegeek.com for Austin players. A third way is by searching Austin Netrunner on Facebook. I found a group there just now.  As for getting started, I echo the sentiment of buying 1 core set first. I has 7 decks in it, so you and your brother can get some games in and see if it's right for you."

Dragon's Lair reliably does Game Night Kits (promos and mats prizes) each second Wednesday of the month at 7 PM. In south Austin call Tribes game store and ask - I think it's Sunday. Handful of people there.  It is my opinion that Dragon's Lair Wednesday nights crowd have migrated to Emerald Tavern for both Weds and Thurs. Though the monthly tournaments still fetch the whole community.  And there's like a gajillion competitive places. All of the podcasts posted here are competitive, with The Winning Agenda being the most no-nonsense strategy talk. Stimhack.com is the most competitive forum, but always remember to both listen to and ignore the hivemind. Netrunnerdb.com and acoo.net compile tournament winning decks and often have writeups and tons of strategy can be extracted reading authors notes.  Good luck, hope to see you there. Lots of people have interest in other LCG games and will be down to play Conquest, Doomtown, or the new AGoT with you. Though they will probably have to get their decks from the car when you ask - because nothing has dethroned Netrunner. I suspect AGoT core set will be quite shallow, and go through the same teething phase Netrunner did. I am both excited for and don't expect much from 2nd edition this first year."

Netrunner,3a4cqp,bunby_heli,2,Wed Jun 17 04:09:21 2015 UTC,"Thomas Haas was always a weird card, to me. I understand it only as a ""safe"" card to try to bait the runner. I don't really understand leaving it out there and advancing it continuously. Because it costs a credit and a click to advance him, for a gain of two credits, it's functionally the same as if you had spent those clicks just gaining one credit. Is it just for the psychological value...?   It's primarily run bait, yes, and most of the time, if you think that the runner doesn't take the bait, you can just rez it and gain whatever you've spent back (which is more than what you can say for other failed traps).  However, it can also serve a place for you to bank your credits and, in the process, throw the runner's calculations off.    Say he knows - maybe because he ran R&D, maybe because he exposed, whatever - you just put a Tollbooth down despite only having 4c.  He confidently runs it...  but then you rez the Thomas Haas you had with 2 advancement tokens to gain 4c and rez the Tollbooth."

Netrunner,3a3j1a,neutronicus,3,Wed Jun 17 00:14:58 2015 UTC,"To be fair, I don't think FFG actually thought it was better than Datasucker (nor did they want it to be). It does install for 0 versus Datasucker's 1, after all. However, click investment is required to actually make use of it and its movement pattern can be very clunky. The issue, of course, is not that it is worse than Datasucker (which was to be expected, given Datasucker's power level), but that it is drastically worse than Datasucker.  Regarding the influence disparity, yeah, no argument there. The cards are functionally quite similar, but Datasucker is the stronger card for less influence. Lukas has stated on numerous occasions that Datasucker's influence cost is something that he wishes he could revisit: https://vimeo.com/125164271"
Netrunner,3a3j1a,captainraffi,2,Wed Jun 17 02:59:05 2015 UTC,Lukas has stated on numerous occasions that Datasucker's influence cost is something that he wishes he could revisit:   They can. With a simple errata. Why they refuse to do that I'll never understand.
Netrunner,3a3j1a,RS14-2,6,Wed Jun 17 19:36:10 2015 UTC,"Imagine a new player deciding to try out their first tournament, and hearing ""I'm sorry, we're going to need to issue you a game loss for playing with an illegal deck. Datasucker is 3 influence now. Didn't you read the errata?""  Errata is fine when it's used to clear up ambiguity. For instance, they're not going to allow the runner to trash programs from their grip on a successful Burke Bugs trace, so they might as well errata the card to bring the text in line with how they're going to require people to play it.   Power level errata makes keeping up with what's legal difficult, and drives people out of the game."

Netrunner,3a3j1a,Ze_ain,2,Wed Jun 17 12:18:57 2015 UTC,"Besides the fact that Caissa need a ridiculous buff to be competitive you underestimate the cost involved in the ability. It's more expensive, requires more setup and is slower than Crescentus, prevents you from using Knight to break the ICE, and forces you to move the Bishop away after using the ability if you intend to keep it, so essentially costs 2 clicks."
Netrunner,3a3j1a,PaxCecilia,1 point,Wed Jun 17 13:00:56 2015 UTC,"Not to mention every Caissa says ""Host $CARDNAME on a piece of ice not hosting a Caïssa""  To use your Bishop and Knight to break & derez an Ice would at least take 4 clicks: 1 to run & break, 1 to move Knight, 1 to move Bishop, 1 to derez the ice. This is assuming that Knight is already installed and hosted on the Ice you'd want to derez, and that Bishop is either already installed or in your grip with a Deep Red installed.  Plus that'll only work under the movement conditions of Knight (the new Ice can't be installed directly before or after the ice he's moving from)."

Netrunner,3a3j1a,the-_-hatman,4,Wed Jun 17 09:10:50 2015 UTC,"Well it can double Whizzard's recurring credits, so if anyone will use it, it's probably him.     I think the thing that galls me the most is the combination of that excellent art and the flavour text that suggests massive ubiquity in the Android universe with such a stinker of a card. From what it says I'd expect something like cyberfeeder or PPVP, a good general-purpose card that's good in some decks and that most decks might at least consider using."
Netrunner,3a3j1a,PaxCecilia,1 point,Wed Jun 17 19:34:43 2015 UTC,"Man, I hear you. I think close to the saddest thing about Skulljack is that the concept you describe is probably what they thought they had achieved with the card. I imagine the logic went something like: ""Hey, so we've got this card that gives you a discount on trashing cards - pretty important, right? Sort of like PPVP and Cyberfeeder - but they only work once per turn! This card has a permanent effect! I guess the disadvantage of taking a brain damage seems justified? Lovely! What's not to love about Skulljack?""  Hence, my disappointment lies in that I genuinely believe that they can't actually have done more than the most cursory playtesting of the card. If you don't actually crunch the numbers or think about logistically using it in a game, yeah, sure, Skulljack seems OK. As soon as you actually compare it to its closest analogues, however, let alone try putting it in a deck, it quickly shows its true colours.  To optimize Skulljack, you would presumably be looking at making either a Valencia or Whizzard deck already running Desperado to make for maximum run efficiency, especially against naked remotes. But even in the aforementioned decks, Skulljack would likely be slowing down the rest of your set-up, not to mention taking up valuable deck slots previously occupied by much better economy cards."

I can't remember the full board state, but it was functionally impossible for me to install and advance my agenda, so I had to walk him into a trap, but to do that I had to play like I was playing the agenda for the win.

Netrunner,3a2i80,prophaniti,-1,Tue Jun 16 22:14:55 2015 UTC,"right? my favorite trick is when I take meat damage or the runner accesses my HQ, I sort of mix my hand up before they pull the card, but instead of actually arranging them randomly I move the stuff I dont care about to the middle of my hand and the others to the edges. When people think your hand is randomly distributed they pull from the middle probably three out of four times. I once had a hand of 3 agendas which never got stolen after 5 accesses just by doing this. (also, never tell your friends that you do this)"
Netrunner,3a2i80,RepoRogue,4,Wed Jun 17 00:16:11 2015 UTC,"That's actually not good. Accesses are supposed to be random, and you shouldn't even be able to see your hand when accesses are being made.

Netrunner,3a2i80,prophaniti,3,Wed Jun 17 02:12:59 2015 UTC,"It is just as random as my opponent decides to make it. I don't hide the fact that I can see what I am holding, and there is nothing preventing me from arranging my hand however I choose at any time. My opponent could randomize his choice by rolling a die or some such, but they don't. I am using bluffing and hidden information to my advantage based on the decisions they are most likely to make. Sneaky? Hell yes. Cheating? Not in any way. He can still pick whichever card he wants regardless of how I arrange my hand, all that changes is his perception of HOW  my hand is arranged."
Netrunner,3a2i80,RepoRogue,3,Wed Jun 17 02:50:34 2015 UTC,"No, what you're doing is deceiving the other player about how randomized the game state is. (In fact, you're explicitly banking on it.) What you said is that you do that precisely because people tend to pick from the middle. If your hand is randomized, then it shouldn't matter which card someone picks, and not everyone comes with a die to randomize their accesses in the face of an opponent acting against the spirit of the rules."

Netrunner,3a1pzf,nelsormensch,10,Tue Jun 16 15:26:48 2015 UTC,0 cost 5 strength ICE that advances the Jinteki kill game? Absolutely!
Netrunner,3a1pzf,dodgepong,8,Tue Jun 16 15:32:53 2015 UTC,"I think this card will see competitive play when PE/ Jinteko kill decks come back into the meta. The ability gets around IHW, and it's pretty much a must break because if you hit a snare, you are in trouble"
Netrunner,3a1pzf,TonyStellato,3,Tue Jun 16 15:37:06 2015 UTC,Mentioning Snare reminds me that it might be good in the new HB id.
Netrunner,3a1pzf,RaptorsWithJetpacks,4,Tue Jun 16 16:01:54 2015 UTC,It's very easy to forget about this card effect when its the only one of its kind right now. I can count up to 10 times someone tried to draw last click after running through this and I had to correct them.  Watch those pesky runners!
Netrunner,3a1pzf,ayylmao31,3,Tue Jun 16 19:53:04 2015 UTC,"I ran it for a bit in my Biotech deck, but too often the runner just walks through it - once they know it's there they can draw up first.  Might make sense as a Sensei target? That's one of those decks I keep wanting to make work."
Netrunner,3a1pzf,m50d,4,Tue Jun 16 16:55:22 2015 UTC,Or Sub Boost (along with Cortex Lock).
Netrunner,3a1pzf,neutronicus,2,Tue Jun 16 17:59:49 2015 UTC,"In my experience, they run fourth click and let it fire. How awesome is a fourth click run?"
Netrunner,3a1pzf,plopplopplopz,2,Tue Jun 16 18:09:23 2015 UTC,"It's awesome if you put it right before a Komainu or before they hit a snare. It's even better if they hit a Junebug or Overwriter, making it immensely harder for them to win."
Netrunner,3a1pzf,vicvonshroom,2,Tue Jun 16 19:20:04 2015 UTC,Ryon Knight loves 4th click runs.
Netrunner,3a1pzf,cwoac,1 point,Wed Jun 17 09:52:30 2015 UTC,"That brings up the often asked question ""Is zero credits too much to pay for something that does nothing?""    The closest card I can think of is Excalibur. It does nothing for 2 credits, and sees some established RP play on scoring servers.  I could see Lockdown play a similar role guarding a Shock-filled Archives in IG or even Tennin. Once you start spending cards on servers that might or might not be damaging (e.g. over R&D with Snares or over shell games), it loses value quickly for everyone but maybe The Brewery with their guaranteed Ronin."
Netrunner,3a1pzf,Glitch29,1 point,Wed Jun 17 10:17:44 2015 UTC,"The difference is that the corp controls when Excalibur is effective. RP loves it to combo with the ID ability. On a scoring server with Ash (or to a lesser extent Caprice) it's also great. Crucially, even if the runner knows it's there, it's still effective. If they're running your scoring server with an upgrade, or running a central with RP, no amount of planning gets around breaking it.  In contrast Lockdown works at most once. Best case you IAA a Junebug-or-agenda into your scoring server - if they know it's there the runner can just draw 3, then run. Likewise with Archives I think. I guess you can stop them running R&D 4 times in the same turn - but if they're in a position to do that you've probably already lost."
Netrunner,3a1pzf,m50d,1 point,Wed Jun 17 12:12:57 2015 UTC,"There's a reason I chose those examples. I'll spell it out. Two things need to happen for Lockdown to work multiple times.   There needs to be damage from the Lockdown server multiple times The runner can't have full information about the server (giving some incentive to run with clicks remaining)   Technically, Komainu or Psychic Field can replace the second condition. Space Camp in archives can replace the condition for the purposes of 4th click runs.  Shock in Archives easily satisfy the first condition. Any unrezzed ICE or rezzed Komainu can satisfy the second.  If the runner thinks they're only taking one damage, but Neural Katana makes them take 4 instead, they might not have drawn up enough. When they draw up more first to play around that, an Ichi or Janus rezzed mid-run might make them wish they hadn't. Or no rez might make them discard to hand size.  Some of those are better value than others, none of it is wildly spectacular.  It requires the same supporting cast as Gyri Labyrinth to work. But you can get multiple effects, and if one of them actually matters it's because it won the game. A zero-cost ICE probably just needs to directly lead to a game win 7-8% of the time to be worth it."
Netrunner,3a1pzf,Glitch29,2,Wed Jun 17 14:06:53 2015 UTC,I wonder how nice this would be in Argus.
Netrunner,3a1pzf,RaptorsWithJetpacks,3,Tue Jun 16 15:37:03 2015 UTC,"One influence says yes.    I like this card a lot. Strength 5 Code Gate is a bargain for 0, and its effect is almost as useful as a bluff as it is for actually killing the runner."
Netrunner,3a1pzf,MrSmith2,3,Tue Jun 16 15:45:53 2015 UTC,Combo it with Psychic Field (another 1 influence card) and you have a very dangerous threat.
Netrunner,3a1pzf,RaptorsWithJetpacks,7,Tue Jun 16 16:03:03 2015 UTC,Psychic Field   How did I never notice this was 1 influence?! WHY HAVEN'T I BEEN IMPORTING IT EVERYWHERE.
Netrunner,3a1pzf,sigma83,2,Tue Jun 16 16:31:24 2015 UTC,"Probably because it only works when installed, so it has no bite from R&D/HQ. Decent for never advance shell games, but who does that?  Wait.  You will do that. Now that you know, I'm sure you will do it. At least once."
Netrunner,3a1pzf,MagnumNopus,2,Tue Jun 16 16:54:12 2015 UTC,You say this like you don't already know what my NBN deck is and what it does.  BWAAAAH
Netrunner,3a1pzf,sigma83,3,Tue Jun 16 16:57:48 2015 UTC,"Well, I mean, the ""no"" in magnumNOpus stands for ""not omniscient"".  Or maybe I just don't pay attention to the right details."
Netrunner,3a1pzf,MagnumNopus,2,Tue Jun 16 17:08:48 2015 UTC,"Pretty good tax on a central, but maybe also decent in a scoring server? I've been thinking about Oaktown Renovation in Argus a lot, maybe there's a way to use that + this for a kill?"
Netrunner,3a1pzf,nialbima,1 point,Tue Jun 16 15:48:39 2015 UTC,Argus    This will be good as a surprise but they will draw first then run if they see it coming.
Netrunner,3a1pzf,BoomFrog,6,Tue Jun 16 18:30:38 2015 UTC,You know what they won't see coming? Self-Destruct.
Netrunner,3a1pzf,nialbima,2,Tue Jun 16 18:59:22 2015 UTC,"This would block I've had worse,  right? If the runner bumped into a snare! After this"
Netrunner,3a1pzf,Number1gun,2,Tue Jun 16 17:12:21 2015 UTC,"I think so, because it doesn't specify the runner can't spend a click to draw cards."
Netrunner,3a1pzf,Ze_ain,1 point,Tue Jun 16 21:16:31 2015 UTC,"Even with just a few Snares and some damaging ICE for tempo hits, a runner will want to break this thing 9/10 times. The threat it causes is real! That means it's not only a great value for helping with kills but cheap tax that stands up really well to stuff like parasite.  I see this as being a strong 1 or 2-of include in any Jinteki deck packing some damage."
Netrunner,3a1pzf,X-factor103,1 point,Tue Jun 16 15:52:50 2015 UTC,"The rez-cost/strength ratio is pretty good.  I've been wanting to try a biotech deck with these and psychic fields/snares/fetal AIs, etc, to try to line up a kill-shot.  Also, I think it has some serious potential with our old (and much maligned) friend Sub-Boost.  Even if they get to use corroder on it instead of zu.13 or whatever, giving your 5-strength ice an extra ETR subroutine is still pretty significant."
Netrunner,3a1pzf,Bwob,1 point,Tue Jun 16 17:58:07 2015 UTC,"It can set up a flat line from a single Neural EMP. It can set up the Scorched flat line (and increase the likelihood of removing the tag). It can create a scoring window (""run the other remote and flat line, or piddle paddle around?""). It's a good piece of ice, but tricky. Placement is key."
Netrunner,3a1pzf,plopplopplopz,1 point,Tue Jun 16 18:08:28 2015 UTC,"I think often times, it's a chum with slightly better numbers--since it probably just forces an unprepared runner to jack-out, or respect it and break. But it is potentially still good even when you rez it. Conversely, a well planned runner might not have to worry about breaking it (but for a zero cost ICE, is that really so bad?).  So, pros and cons, probably a good sign for any card, and 0/5 are the kinds of numbers you want to see. good with chum, good with sub boost. I think in a lot of ways, it works like a false lead you didn't have to score, since usually you ditch those to stick a tag or catch them with their hand empty.  So IDK, interesting prospects, not much more you could ask of such a cheap ICE."
Netrunner,3a1pzf,thefalseidol,2,Tue Jun 16 18:15:01 2015 UTC,Actually it's a nice combo in a deck that uses false lead because a scored false lead will pressure them to run first or second click.  This ICE seems best in RP.
Netrunner,3a1pzf,BoomFrog,1 point,Tue Jun 16 18:33:45 2015 UTC,"That wasn't to say that you ditch false lead, just that it could work as a ghetto false lead in a pinch--since it doesn't require as much setup or telegraphing."

Netrunner,3a1pzf,sigma83,1 point,Wed Jun 17 06:27:11 2015 UTC,"Because they'll be packing a deck that does net damage, so you can dodge that potentially fatal snare/fetal."

Netrunner,3a1pzf,sigma83,1 point,Wed Jun 17 08:50:50 2015 UTC,"This on a server with a Self-destruct, with a Ronin/Junebug sitting waiting could be nasty.  They can't draw up after the damage, so they die if they don't run the ronin. But they die if they do run the junebug.  Alternatively you have a self-destruct in with the ronin too, but then you need a lot of credits!"

Netrunner,3a1pzf,clarionx,1 point,Tue Jun 16 16:42:21 2015 UTC,at that point would't it be better as a junebug?
Netrunner,3a1pzf,thefalseidol,3,Tue Jun 16 18:07:16 2015 UTC,Depends. Works on expose and counters runners who draw up before running or are playing with the new hand side increase abilities.
Netrunner,3a1pzf,clarionx,1 point,Tue Jun 16 18:22:38 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but there is very little expose being played and I've yet to see a really strong +hand size deck come together. You are right, the two are better at different things, but I think for a Mushin target, you could do better than a psychic field."

Netrunner,39zh8f,joelseph,3,Tue Jun 16 15:45:13 2015 UTC,Those 2 cards will retain their value on the second hand market or may even increase.  It's an investment.  Buying Netrunner is not an investment.
Netrunner,39zh8f,aka_Foamy,2,Tue Jun 16 13:53:07 2015 UTC,"How many people are actually going to come out of magic like it's an investment though? All the players I know who have investment levels of cards (~£1000+) are all in so deep that they'll never sell them to buy anything more than more magic cards. The prices are driven by how good they are and if it's a good card they want to keep their copies for their decks. The people who are forced out of it will sell up and get some money back but they'll have lost the fun and community that comes with it. It's all a sunk cost. Netrunner's sunk cost is just less, and as a great bonus we don't have to endlessly trade and bargain to try put together a deck."
Netrunner,39zh8f,joelseph,2,Tue Jun 16 16:42:38 2015 UTC,"In my experience the majority of eternal format players recognize the investment nature of Modern, Legacy, Vintage formats.  For example when I started playing a good standard format staple was Snapcaster Mages.  They are no longer playable in standard but see play in eternal formats and their price continue to rise.  A playset of 4 snapcasters is seen as a great investment."

Netrunner,3a22nf,inthedark72,8,Tue Jun 16 16:58:16 2015 UTC,"I switched from a card box to 2 binders (3 inch each) around the beginning of this year. I prefer the binder method.  I have 3 core sets and I'm up to date on sets and data packs. I store 3 copies of each card (front page and back page) and that seems to work well. I put extra copies of 2x/3x cards from the core set in a spare deck box. Whenever, I build a deck I take the core sets out of the deck box first, then the binder.  I sort the card by faction, then type, then set number."
Netrunner,3a22nf,tvaduva,5,Tue Jun 16 17:49:34 2015 UTC,"If you want my honest opinion, use card boxes instead. It's much easier to organize, especially when new sets come out, and much easier to find things.  If I want a Anarch program that begins with c, I simply go to the programs section, go the the Anarch part of that, and then the 'c ' part of that.  If a new Anarch c program card comes out I simply put it right there in the card box - now I can find it just as easy.  No memorizing which set each card is from or moving cards from slot to slot with each new release, and if I don't know what I want I can easily flip through all weyland operations, or all shaper resources, or even just all ice, I Don't have to go set by set.  If you are dead set on binders, simply put 3 of each card in a slot.  You'll have 9 sure gambles, so use 3 slots for those.  You'll have three deaperados, so only use one slot there.  You'll have 6 of the 2 of cards, so use two slots for those."

FWIW: I have a binder each for corp and runner then sort by set number exclusively. Since I'm only building decks with computer tools (i.e. Netrunnerdb) there's no need to do any further sorting as you can sort decklists by set number. Also, when you are adding a new data pack to the binder there is literally no sorting to do, just remove the cards from the pack in order and put them into sleeves at the back of the binder. Unbuilding a deck is simple, the set number is printed on the card with a unique symbol for each core / cycle / big box expansion.  I've also have separate pages for each datapack. I've found that there are a lot of empty sleeve slots (since there are 20 cards in each pack, you need a minimum of 3 pages per pack) but it will allow me to move sets that are rotated out into a separate binder by simply removing their pages."

I know some people who would want to organize further, for example, by set, but I haven't bothered being that specific.

When is a variable chosen for a card in which that variable is not defined by the card itself?When deciding X, is it decided by the effect including X or is it decided by choosing an X and then resolving the effect with X in it?  2a. The variable is chosen whenever it is necessary to resolve the effect. So for Vamp, you do not have to set the value of X until the run is successful. For Psychographics, you have to set the value when playing it because it is part of the cost. So option 1 is correct.   2b. X is a value that is set at one time. So you spend X credits from Vamp, but you cannot spend more credits than you have. With Power Shutdown, you trash X cards from your deck, but you do not see the cards that are trashed until X is defined. You cannot trash more than the number of cards in your deck, either."
Netrunner,3a1lmk,BlueSapphyre,3,Tue Jun 16 15:01:34 2015 UTC,"See that makes absolutely no sense to me. With Daily casts, the printed cost is 3, but playing it with Career Fair reduces the cost to 0, so I pay 0. With Angel arena, the printed cost is X, but playing it with Career Fair reduces the cost to X-3, so I pay X-3. X is simply the printed cost of the card, not necessarily the card's actual cost.  It should just act like when you play the card, you choose the value of X, and then treat the card as if all instances of X were replaced by the chosen number.  I mean, I know I'm arguing against the official rulings here, it just doesn't make sense to me."
Netrunner,3a1lmk,llama66613,9,Tue Jun 16 18:05:31 2015 UTC,"I agree. But thems the rules. X cost cards are awkward because of this ruling, it would've been easier to have them cost 0, with an additional cost of X. Then this ruling would make more sense."

Netrunner,3a1lmk,lunatic_calm,4,Tue Jun 16 18:18:47 2015 UTC,"It interacts in the same way that other cost-effecting cards do. When you advance Nebula, its rez cost is reduced by 3. Later, if you bounce it with Blue Sun, it still has the discount so you'd only gain 6 credits.  Career Fair doesn't make you pay less for installing a resource, it literally reduces the install cost, which defines X. If X is reduced, effects that use X as a value are similarly reduced. Making the X on Angel Arena an additional cost like Draco or Atman would make it work more like what you're saying."
Netrunner,3a1lmk,rumirumirumirumi,1 point,Tue Jun 16 18:59:16 2015 UTC,"But X isn't the install cost. X is the printed install cost. The two, although closely related, are entirely distinct things."

Because that section of the card is not called ""the printed install cost"" but ""the install cost."" Angel Arena's install cost is X (that's what a printed cost of X means). If there was a reduction of AA's install cost, it would be a tautology to say X is similarly reduced because X = the install cost. It's unintuitive because we're used to reducing the costs of cards without altering their effects, but that's because most cards don't have a variable effect defined by install or play costs. It's a novel effect, and yet it's consistent with rules about the changes on costs."
Netrunner,3a1lmk,rumirumirumirumi,2,Tue Jun 16 19:38:32 2015 UTC,"From the FAQ:   Rez Cost & Play Cost Rez and play costs are formulas that take into account any effects that modify them. They are not just the printed number on the card.   The printed install cost of Daily Casts is 3. However, using Career fair, I am able to reduce by 3, to a total of 0. This is what the FAQ means by formula. Reducing the install cost of Angel Arena doesn't change the value of X any more than reducing the install cost of Daily Casts changes the value of 3."

Netrunner,3a1lmk,vampire0,3,Tue Jun 16 20:47:48 2015 UTC,"I mean, it's not that hard.

Donut doesn't say ""As an additional cost to play Operations, pay 1 credit,"" he says the play cost of operations is increased by 1, which defines X for Psychographics (which in turn cannot exceed the number of tags)."

When I play Angel Arena with Career Fair, the value of the number in the circle suddenly does change; now, for some reason, X is the actual install cost of the card, rather than the printed install cost, which, as per the FAQ, are two things which are not the same."
Netrunner,3a1lmk,llama66613,2,Wed Jun 17 20:53:56 2015 UTC,"I guess I don't know what you mean. The install cost has been reduced, so in so far as the value 3 is the install cost of Daily Cast you have effected that value. X is defined as the install cost, not just the printed cost X. Otherwise, what you're saying would have the result you want it to have.  I'm not saying it's the best way to handle these things. I'm saying it's the way to make sense of the rules of the game, and it's consistent with the other rules of the game. The way you're arguing it would make sense if the result you got was the actual result of the game. But as it stands you're arguing a thing that is not.  Edit: let me try putting it this way. Let's imagine there wasn't a spot in the corner for play costs, and instead we had to write the cost in the card text. Daily Cast might read ""The install cost of Daily Cast is 3,"" and nothing would change because things would alter the install cost and we'd be able to derive how many credits it costs to install it at any given moment with the same formulas we use now. Angel Arena might read ""The install cost of Angel Arena is X"". There is similarly no change to either the cost to install the card or the value of X because we'd be left with all the same formulas and the result of the formulas would both be exactly how much you paid and how many counters go on AA. It's unituitive because we're used to having the install cost change to not equal what's printed on the card, but in the case of X as an install cost, X is the install cost."
Netrunner,3a1lmk,rumirumirumirumi,1 point,Tue Jun 16 20:25:21 2015 UTC,"What I'm saying is that it is incredibly bizarre that X is defined as the final install cost of the card, when it would be much more intuitive and consistent if it was simply the printed install cost. After all, X is the install cost that is printed on the card, so why is it not the printed install cost?  Daily Casts has a 3 printed in a circle in the top left corner. It's printed install cost is 3. Earthrise Hotel has a 4 printed in a circle in the top left corner. It's printed install cost is 4. Angel Arena has an X printed in the top left corner. But it's printed install cost is ???, and X is whatever value you actually end up spending to install it, which is inconsistent with other cards.  Let's look at it this way: if we replace all instances of ""X"" with ""3"", then it's obvious how it would work. You install it at a discount with 3 counters. It's also obvious how it would work if you replace X with 4, or 2, or any possible number. In all cases, you would still get the printed number of power counters, but be able to install it for the discounted price.  But suddenly when you change it to be X, for some reason the behavior changes. Instead of simply choosing the value of X and playing it as if X was whatever number you chose, X becomes install cost after discount for no discernible reason."
Netrunner,3a1lmk,llama66613,2,Tue Jun 16 20:44:27 2015 UTC,"If Angel Arena put power counters on itself equal to the install cost, it would be obvious how reductions in its install cost would change its effect even if its printed cost was 3. Angel Arena does that by having an install cost of X and putting X counters on itself.  If a new FAQ came down that reinterpreted X-costed cards in the way you (and many others, including at one time myself), I wouldn't be bothered so long as all the rules changed to reflect it. I'd do what I've always done: try to make sense of the rules as they are."

Netrunner,3a0hz5,BlueSapphyre,1 point,Tue Jun 16 13:38:42 2015 UTC,"I think it still resolves them sequentially, so if the Runner flatlines it gives the win to the Corp, its just that the game engine does not shut down once you reach 7 points, although it does notify the players of the victory. Since the action (accessing like 5 cards) is still unresolved (despite the win) the rest of the accesses continue in order. Given that there is no built in pausing or waiting between accesses (to speed up game play) the players would see a 6 to 18 point jump, even though the accesses are resolved in sequence.  There are some weird things though, like if you Maker's Eye and see an Caprice, Ash, NAPD (in that order) - I think you can see in the game log the names of the cards you've accessed even before resolving the trash/steal conditions of each card sequentially.

Netrunner,3a0hz5,RestarttGaming,3,Tue Jun 16 09:31:38 2015 UTC,"The most relevant would probably be Jinteki. If you hit three Fetal AIs off the top of R&D, but the first one wins you the game, you don't keep accessing and taking all 6 net damage."
Netrunner,39z0aw,TonyStellato,17,Mon Jun 15 22:58:25 2015 UTC,"A lot of people are in the same boat. Several top players who haven't managed to win a regionals yet weren't able to get tickets because they were at work or otherwise indisposed for  the ~80 minutes that tickets were available. I hope FFG moves the event to a different location to accommodate more people, but I kind of doubt they will since it's ""too late in the process"".  Personally I'll be looking forward to the ANRPC events coming up for open competition, maybe even some sort of unified event."
Netrunner,39z0aw,dodgepong,1 point,Mon Jun 15 23:36:32 2015 UTC,"Whats that thing about winning a regional? I guess its US-Regional only, right?"
Netrunner,39z0aw,Lonailan,1 point,Tue Jun 16 12:16:28 2015 UTC,"I read on the FFG page that US regional winnners, the US national winner, and winners of selected nationals around the world would have reserved spots."
Netrunner,39z0aw,flowerscandrink,0,Tue Jun 16 14:35:12 2015 UTC,"One way to handle the cap would be to just make two events. One open event with however many people they can fit on first come/first served registration. Then a second invitational championship that's just open to qualified participants, but is otherwise uncapped."
Netrunner,39z0aw,Glitch29,12,Tue Jun 16 05:35:40 2015 UTC,I think that most competitive players feel the same way: if FFG doesn't dramatically improve their structure for competitive events they will be abandoned in favor of fan run circuits.
Netrunner,39z0aw,ElderMason,12,Tue Jun 16 02:10:56 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't say ""abandoned;"" I think if FFG does more events with a cap like this, they'll probably always hit their caps.  I would just expect the fan circuits' attendance to surpass the ""official"" events. :3"
Netrunner,39z0aw,SevenCs,3,Tue Jun 16 02:29:29 2015 UTC,No chance. They'll still sell out. People will grumble but they'll still sell out. Even if the fan run circuits get off the ground FFG will still be the only ones offering promos and the chance to design a card for the game as prizes.
Netrunner,39z0aw,Rejusu,2,Tue Jun 16 15:36:21 2015 UTC,i would rather have money than either of those things.
Netrunner,39z0aw,ddecay,2,Tue Jun 16 17:54:57 2015 UTC,"Well you can't do it with the latter but promos and playmats can be converted into cash. Nationals in the UK has already been and gone and people are selling their Ken Tenma promos for upwards of £50 (about $80) and you got one of those just for turning up. Think how much it costs FFG to produce a promo and do the maths.  At any rate whatever you would rather have, it doesn't change the fact that short of hiking up admission fees insanely and killing prize support the FFG tournaments are going to still sell out. Heck they could cap the attendance to ten people and you'd still find ten players who'd buy tickets while the other two hundred grumble about how they're going to boycott it.  We all knew in advance they were capping attendance on Worlds this year, didn't stop it selling out within an hour. Won't stop it selling out next year either. ANRPC aint going to change that. Also it's a tad ridiculous that a lot of people are pinning their hopes on them given that they've yet to run a successful circuit."
Netrunner,39z0aw,Rejusu,40,Tue Jun 16 20:38:09 2015 UTC,"Okay, I know this is going to be wildly unpopular but here it is: This has to stop. It's petulant, at best. You live in the Internet Age, this is the reality of any scenario where demand vastly outstrips supply. Whether it's Worlds, The Super Bowl, PAX, or a Taylor Swift concert, a LOT of people are going to be unhappy. Without a cap they can't realistically schedule the amount of time and space they need to run a clean, tight event. Before you lambast them because you, like 99% of consumers in this case, aren't among the lucky few consider their other options:  1) My personal choice would to be run multiple Worlds weekends throughout the month of November. They can dedicate more time and resources to each game, and hopefully get room for more people that want to come. The downside here is that people who want to attend multiple events have to hope the schedule is agreeable to them. It's unlikely anyone's getting the whole month off.  2) They could make tickets cost more. In the simplest economic terms, this is what works best, but also comes with the general public rioting and balking at $150+ tickets or whatever the magic number is to get the supply and demand curves to intersect.  3) They could move to another location. Too late for that this year, but it's something they said they considered, and the restrictions are probably pretty similar: They still can't fit an infinite number of people, and tickets are still going to sell out quickly. As an added bonus, this probably also makes the event cost more because they have to cover their expenses for renting a different facility.  4) They don't cap the event, and just let pandemonium reign. This is the fastest way to make sure a cap isn't necessary, because after one spectacularly shitty event, who's going to want to go back?  5) They restructure the competitive scene and make Worlds by invitation only. I'm pretty okay with this, but there's no way around the fact that to do things like Magic PTQ, we'd have to wrestle with the fact that the competitive scene still needs to grow a lot to justify this sort of restructuring. I won an 11 person store championship this year, and it honestly didn't feel like I deserved anything. Double Double Bonus: This probably means you STILL don't get to go, so your situation is not improved.  So until your solution is out and out better than their solution, I'd stow the disappointment. As a PAX vet, I know for a fact that people much smarter than I have tried to tackle this exact problem with a lot of different answers, and the result is always the same: A lot of unhappy people. Take it as a positive: The health of the game has never been stronger, the community has never been larger, and it's never been easier to sit down, and play a great game of Netrunner. I call that a win, even if I don't get to go to Minnesota this year."
Netrunner,39z0aw,IceRay42,2,Tue Jun 16 04:13:45 2015 UTC,"I like it how you say $150 tickets.  I'm assuming many getting into competitive netrunner and transferring from MtG (I am) and a $150 ticket price wouldn't phase them at all.  By the time with airline tix + hotel, you are looking at a $500-700 weekend (for those already in the US - international will be more $$$) and it wouldn't be unreasonable to set tickets to $300-500 per seat per event.  You're playing at worlds, MtG players don't even get a chance at that until they've won a series of other events and there is no way to just buy in.  7 Years ago, I drove 6 hours to play in a 200 person MtG tournament just to have a shot at a seat on the Pro Tour and demand has only grown since then!  My final note is that nearly everyone knew it was going to sell out insanely fast and when the tickets were going to be available.  I just started playing 3 weeks ago and got dialed into that fact by reading online.  If you couldn't find a friend to pick up tickets for you, what does that say?"
Netrunner,39z0aw,JediCheese,4,Tue Jun 16 12:25:14 2015 UTC,"Are you crazy?  You'd pay $500 for the chance to win a playmat?  Just look at the prizes on offer between the two events.  There's nothing in the entirety of the Netrunner prize pool that would justify even the $150 entry price, let alone paying flights/accomodation on top.    Wait, you want bragging rights to be the world champ of an event where the good players didn't bother going because they'd correctly calculated the EV of playing in the event?  Go right ahead, brother.  You mail me $500 and I will make you a World Champ trophy to put on the mantelpiece.  This isn't Magic.  There's a big pot of gold driving people to pay/play Magic and that pot of gold doesn't exist in Netrunner."
Netrunner,39z0aw,satellite_uplink,3,Tue Jun 16 12:37:33 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't spend the money.  But that's primarily because I'm not invested enough to buy airline tix and a hotel room and I'm not going to Minneapolis in the Winter for a hobby (I got out of there and am never going back voluntarily in the winter).  If I was in the half a grand price range already for a trip to scenic Minneapolis in the middle of Winter, a $150 entry fee wouldn't faze me.  I'll give you a pro-tip: there's no pot of gold for a pro Magic player.  Top 8 of Vegas (an 8,000 player tournament) resulted in someone drafting a foil mythic rare card ($300) over a common that is insane in limited and helps win games (just google Goyfgate)."
Netrunner,39z0aw,JediCheese,3,Tue Jun 16 12:55:47 2015 UTC,"There's a pot of gold in Magic - Pro Tour Champs walk off with $40k thankyouverymuch.  That'll buy you a pretty blinging playmat.  That doesn't change the EV calculation of taking a foil 'goyf over a random common for your deck (which he was right to do, btw).  I've played on the Pro Tour and moneyed in more than one GP.  I'm lifetime in the black on Magic (my winnings > cards cost and travel expenses).  It makes sense to travel to GPs and PPTQs on the basis of the prize you're shooting towards.  For Netrunner it doesn't even make financial sense to get on the bus to travel to my FLGS for a playmat, I do it for the love of the game but it's bad EV... I'd be better off buying a plane ticket to Copenhagen for the GP."
Netrunner,39z0aw,satellite_uplink,6,Tue Jun 16 13:10:26 2015 UTC,"3) They could move to another location. Too late for that this year, but it's something they said they considered, and the restrictions are probably pretty similar: They still can't fit an infinite number of people, and tickets are still going to sell out quickly. As an added bonus, this probably also makes the event cost more because they have to cover their expenses for renting a different facility.   I just checked with both the St. Paul and Minneapolis Convention Centers, November 14-15th are completely open, and the original planned dates of the 4th-8th have very little in conflict (women's roller derby worlds at the st paul center 6-8th, some wedding planning event on the 8th at Minneapolis). Neither of these events take up the whole center, there are several hotels in the twin city area that could also host this out of a ballroom, and this took me 5 whole minutes to look up.   It is laughable to say they can't move the event, they can, but they won't, because they want to show off their fancy new game center that is already way too small.   Also, you don't have to host infinite people, you have to host enough. A large ballroom would be enough for any netrunner event and then some, this is why magic GPs get 2000+"
Netrunner,39z0aw,itsbigfoot,13,Tue Jun 16 05:10:54 2015 UTC,"Getting a larger facility doesn't get you more judges, which is probably the biggest bottleneck for a large event like this. For 2,000 people, you'd want at least 100 judges.  Right now without a judge program in place, the only way to get them is through personal relationships.  That might work to find 10 good judges and 20 okay ones between FFG employees, and other notable TOs who are willing to fly in and not play.  But it doesn't scale upwards very far without running into major issues with staffing quality."
Netrunner,39z0aw,Glitch29,8,Tue Jun 16 06:07:36 2015 UTC,"But they had to make a plan, they chose one, they used their number from last year, and they tried to move forward. There was none of this outrage in 2013 (166 people) or 2014 (238 people), and people are mad at them for what: trying to cater to audiences of multiple games and use their own facilities to do it? Really? I'm sorry, but every version of that line feels childish to me.  It may not be a perfect plan, but even saying ""Oh just use nearby convention centers"" doesn't answer a lot of logistical questions. I'm not defending their solution as perfect, I'm defending it as an option that services many other realistic expectations and considerations."
Netrunner,39z0aw,IceRay42,-2,Tue Jun 16 05:54:08 2015 UTC,"Here's some basic business advice: If your plan prevents a large chunk of your potential customer base from giving you money, change your plan. Using the numbers from last year is either naive or ignorant giving the amount of growth and exposure the game has received since. We are mad because this was the easiest thing in the world to see coming and they made no effort to work around it.   I feel like ""logistical issues"" is the blanket ffg excuse for ""we don't want to put effort into this"" as it is not terribly hard for a company the size of ffg to organize a weekend in a ballroom, when precedent for how this should be done has been set for over a decade now.  Oh, and I think the main reason everyone is angry is a culmination of the past several times ffg has dropped the ball in regards to competitive netrunner. The worlds event has grown by about 200 entrants each year, not accommodating at least part of that is a huge mistake. When their vp of communications says ""this year will be significantly larger than last year"" you'd think they would account for more than 18 people."
Netrunner,39z0aw,itsbigfoot,9,Tue Jun 16 06:35:10 2015 UTC,"If they have to rent an expo center tickets would double in price. FFG doesn't make WotC levels of money off their games, and the quickest way to kill your business is to expand too quickly."
Netrunner,39z0aw,tankintheair315,-1,Tue Jun 16 09:40:38 2015 UTC,"Wow, I couldn't disagree more. Why is supply this short? Why even choose this venue when they are the people who know the numbers behind their games the best? Its hard to look at the bright sides of the scenario when so many competitive players are being shafted. I travelled from out of country last year to attend, so why are dedicated players like myself not given a good option to support the game, company and community? Most importantly, I don't think people should stop complaining about it. The only way to get change in the system is to be vocal about it, or to ""vote with your wallet"". I don't want to stop supporting the game I love, so...."
Netrunner,39z0aw,IceRay42,13,Tue Jun 16 04:27:23 2015 UTC,"Worlds saw 238 people last year, maybe a bump up to 300+ would've been called for, but 256 was not an unreasonable guess, and now people want to bring their torches and pitchforks to bear because why exactly? How could they announce Worlds if they were just like ""Well we'll just figure out seating after registration for all of our games.""  These things take planning and execution, and their ballpark guess could've accounted for more growth, but it still wasn't far off the mark. My complaint is that people are self-absorbed in their ranting and raving. SOMEONE was going to not get to go to Worlds this year, no matter what the proposed solution was, you are not any more entitled than anyone else not getting to go (myself included) just because the event has to be hosted in reality, not in faerie unicorn land where everyone's wishes are granted.  You don't see anyone suggesting they just hold open seating for the Super Bowl or EPL Championship do you?"
Netrunner,39z0aw,captainraffi,3,Tue Jun 16 05:54:03 2015 UTC,"now people want to bring their torches and pitchforks to bear because why exactly? How could they announce Worlds if they were just like ""Well we'll just figure out seating after registration for all of our games.""   Given the absolute shit storm that occurred over the Plugged In Tour, and some FFG employees saying that they'd never do another one after all the negativity, I'm not surprised that they're just sort of doing it their way, in their space, for what's comfortable for them. They've always seemed to support a casually competitive space vs a super competitive one and this feels in line with it.   They seem to be happy to continue having the NA championships at GenCon despite criticism that not all the best players go to GenCon therefore it doesn't count or isn't as legit."
Netrunner,39z0aw,Glitch29,5,Tue Jun 16 13:46:09 2015 UTC,"Running tournaments with 2,000-3,000 people is a lot different than running tournaments with 400-600. If you need any evidence of that, look at some of the largest MtG tournament between 2011 and 2013.  A lot of things went horribly wrong, and the TOs got publically crucified for it. Wizards was lambasted for giving events to inept TOs. I can't blame FFG at all for wanting to cap attendance.  They will probably boost the cap every year as they get used to running these large events, but it could have been absolutely disastrous for them to just have open registration.  Once you concede that a cap was necessary, no one way of dividing those tickets was much better than any other. No matter how they did it, the same total number of people were going to miss out. They gave plenty of advance warning about how the process would go. While IceRay42 might have been a little heated with his choice of words, most of his points are very valid. FFG didn't have great options to make everyone happy, so complaining about it isn't going to do that much good."
Netrunner,39z0aw,Aramile,5,Tue Jun 16 05:57:59 2015 UTC,The worst part about this is the time they became available is so inconvenient for Americans. It's a game based in America (the midwest to be precise) and anyone working a normal 9-5 type job was basically screwed by the Noon ticket release. Why in the world would you cap the event at just a handful more than the previous years attendance and then put tickets on sale at noon on a Monday of all days?
Netrunner,39z0aw,roguefan99,3,Tue Jun 16 01:44:55 2015 UTC,"I suspect they knew there were going to be issues (see any interview where world have been mentioned) and in an effort to not have the servers crash they decided to do it during their business hours.  Not defending the issue (I would hope to think if Magic can do something like the Vegas GP we could get more people at worlds), just the way I think they thought it out."
Netrunner,39z0aw,Calc3,3,Tue Jun 16 01:55:39 2015 UTC,"Doing it during their business hours for their convenience sounds pretty FFG. Also, I think they might (unwisely) have thought things would be available for maybe a day or so."
Netrunner,39z0aw,2414682040998,2,Tue Jun 16 05:38:58 2015 UTC,"No way were they worried about server load. They used a ticket vendor, and this whole thing is just 500-1000 people compared to a cap of 250. Their servers could handle 1000 people."
Netrunner,39z0aw,keylimetart,5,Tue Jun 16 03:00:56 2015 UTC,"Me too, man, I was on a plane this morning. I've been playing for a little over a year, and I was really looking forward to going to my first-ever Worlds and meeting all the cool people in our online community, but I guess that's not going to happen."
Netrunner,39z0aw,theodorelogan0735,4,Tue Jun 16 01:11:48 2015 UTC,"One thing that I don't see being discussed is the possibility that FFG is purposefully keeping it at 256 because of concerns over the length of the tournament. If FFG wants to keep the Netrunner World Championship to a single day, then I don't see how they can make it any larger.  If the goal is to keep it to a single day, then I think that reserving spots for the national champs, regional champs, and previous world champs is a great way to make sure that the competition is still of the highest caliber. I think that Netrunner has gotten so big that the days that everybody gets to go to the world championship might be over. There is a number at which this has to happen. FFG's number is 256. Is that not the right number?"
Netrunner,39z0aw,teky-gaming,4,Wed Jun 17 03:38:07 2015 UTC,I read you all and then remember I live in a country where the game is not even officially distributed and anything that feel slightly like a tournament is basically organized and run by me...   So cheer up guys! 😁

Netrunner,39z0aw,Goldenfoon,3,Tue Jun 16 01:29:57 2015 UTC,"I think there are a bunch of people who bought a ticket with the "" I got one just in-case I can go"" mentality, but will ultimately return it at the last minute.   I know that sucks for organizing travel plans and lodging, but I would try to buy one on the last day that they offer the full price return option."
Netrunner,39z0aw,vampire0,2,Tue Jun 16 14:58:11 2015 UTC,"I managed to grab a ticket, but I totally sympathize - I only managed it because I happened to see a Facebook post about it at like 5 minutes after the slot opened - if I hadn't been bored in a taco line I'd have been out of luck too."

Netrunner,39z0aw,SevenCs,2,Tue Jun 16 02:06:42 2015 UTC,"This is the strongest point in favor of the fan-run circuits, I think.  The Netrunner community is consistently great.  You can take a road trip to a tournament and you're all but guaranteed to have a good time once there. I'm not sure FFG has fully grasped the impact a solid, strong community has on turnout and willingness to travel to events."
Netrunner,39z0aw,X-factor103,2,Tue Jun 16 02:31:12 2015 UTC,"All this discussion! I don't play to go to Worlds, but I can certainly empathize for those that do!  If anything, I hope this shows FFG just how popular this game is getting and just how big the competitive scene is becoming. They might be too far along to change anything this year, but hopefully this will spur them towards changes for next year and thereafter.   Either that or competition is about to get even stiffer at regionals/nationals for those invitations."
Netrunner,39z0aw,X-factor103,1 point,Tue Jun 16 15:06:31 2015 UTC,"Yes, that was more or less the point. I didn't mean for this to be a whine thread, more to show FFG what the demand is like. I hope people are openly speaking out about this so that next year it can accommodate more players/be released on a weekend"
Netrunner,39z0aw,satellite_uplink,0,Tue Jun 16 15:40:27 2015 UTC,Agreed! It's a wonderful product and quite possibly one of the best card games ever made. It'd be great for FFG to step up and really treat this thing with the support it deserves.
Netrunner,39z0aw,haagendazsbioroid,2,Tue Jun 16 15:44:40 2015 UTC,"FFG aren't interested in supporting Netrunner as a competitive game really.  It makes sense from their point of view to pay lip service to competitions or competitive metagames, just sucks to be in that minority of people who are playing it competitively.  If there's going to be competitive Netrunner then it has to be fan run, I feel.  It's not a failing on FFG's part, it's just their (probably correct) business decision not to support competitive Netrunner."
Netrunner,39z0aw,satellite_uplink,3,Tue Jun 16 11:26:43 2015 UTC,"More and more it seems like this is the case, or at least that the resources required just wouldn't be worth it to FFG. If you were a person at FFG reading threads like these, could you really blame them?"
Netrunner,39z0aw,EARL_OF_CUTS_MANOR,3,Tue Jun 16 12:47:01 2015 UTC,"It's not just at Worlds level though.  Prize support throughout the organised play network for Netrunner (and all other LCGs) is relatively sparse and there to support fans of the game with unique items rather than encourage competitive play with serious rewards.  It's clearly a deliberate decision for where FFG want to pitch organised play for their games.  When you look at Magic and the behemoth of an organisation that is required to run a proper organised play network with real prizes FOR ONE GAME you can understand why FFG don't want to go down that route for their many games.  FFG's business model is also split in so many different directions, LCGs are just one business for them and then Netrunner is just one of their LCGs.... Magic gets like 95% of WotC's attention because it's the pillar holding up the company.  Netrunner is an anomaly for FFG, in that it's a game where the competitive popularity outstrips their other games without them ever really having had to do anything to make that happen.  I don't see much incentive for FFG to go to a ton of effort making Netrunner organised play an exception for their company when they're doing quite nicely thankyou already.  The Netrunner community has done a fantastic job of supporting this game and making organised play a success.  The community is going to have to continue to step up if they want to create a more serious organised play network than what FFG are able/willing to support."

Netrunner,39z0aw,Horse625,2,Tue Jun 16 19:42:29 2015 UTC,You are correct.  I did not fully read the confirmation email and had no gone to confirm for Netrunner.  So yes it is sold out.  I didn't expect anyone to use such a stupid system for registering....Pay before you actually register for the event...
Netrunner,39z0aw,MasterAir,1 point,Tue Jun 16 20:29:38 2015 UTC,"Just barely got into the Thrones 2.0 tournament, Netrunner was completely sold out when I did.  It sucks that they have to cap it, and it's unfortunate that a lot of people won't get to participate in the events they want, but there's really not a better way to do it.  They could rent a bigger facility but they'd still have to staff the events."
Netrunner,39z0aw,mattastr0phic,1 point,Tue Jun 16 15:41:06 2015 UTC,I think we can all agree Worlds is too small. I think the fact it's too small exacerbates the problem. People have bought tickets now and will cancel if they can't make it. I sincerely hope that there are players enough to fill all seats (~95% turnout) come tournament day.  I hope FFG put on a bigger show next year. We'll see how the ANRPC does. I'm optimistic that it'll be good for the game. Hopefully the BABW series gets a good turnout. I think comparisons to MtG are difficult.

Netrunner,39zvro,se4n,6,Tue Jun 16 03:18:34 2015 UTC,"I love ELP and love Hacktivist Meeting.  I used to play a one of Net Celebrity to counter other currents in my Quetzal deck, but I've since ditched it for the far superior Hacktivist.  It was decent.  On the corp side, Paywall Implementation is great out of Gagarin, and Manhunt is great out of Making News.  I'm not sold on Lag Time.  When I play glacier usually I'm HB, where I'd rather have ELP as a current every time.  Cerebral Static could be great in a Noise Heavy meta."
Netrunner,39zvro,12inchrecord,2,Tue Jun 16 12:15:15 2015 UTC,"Lag Time vs ELP is often similar - ELP is better at protecting remote Assets by draining two clicks to go and trash them, Lag Time is better in pure glacier if the runner is trying to plough through those glaciers.  I think it's key strengths are around where specific Ice vs specific Icebreakers really benefit from the extra strength.  So adding +1 strength to Wraparound doesn't mean much, but +1 to Architect (vs Mimic) or Viper/Lotus (vs Yog.0/NRE) can be crucial.  I switched to Lag Time over ELP in my Waldemar deck because to me it was more important to secure my three-Ice & Caprice scoring server than it was to tax a click."
Netrunner,39zvro,satellite_uplink,7,Tue Jun 16 12:30:12 2015 UTC,"The problem with Currents in general is that they can be high variance in the sense that your opponent could score quickly and shut them off. They can be good, or they can be worse than a blank card. Corp decks that have 11 agendas have a hard time keeping them on, and Runner decks run the risk of them getting turned off more or less instantly by fast advance. Currents in general are just not powerful or plentiful enough to warrant you playing a current to counter them at the moment.  They're not bad enough that you shouldn't ever play them, but they need to make a lot of sense for your deck AND make sense in the metagame to be justified."
Netrunner,39zvro,Calc3,2,Tue Jun 16 05:34:54 2015 UTC,"i think currents are inherently stronger on a corp deck, since they generally hold the pace of the agendas in their hand and runners have to get lucky to find them, unless agenda flood."
Netrunner,39zvro,Gammaran,3,Tue Jun 16 06:01:13 2015 UTC,"Tulsa RP players played lots of Cerebral Static, arguably the only one outside Targeted Marketing that hasn't seen play. After Tulsa, every original corp current has seen competitive play except TM. Net Celebrity and especially Hackitivist has seen lots of play competitively too.   I think currents belong in very snowbally decks. Corps with 9 or less agendas, Runners with lots of econ denial or a runner who doesn't get locked out often.   Useful, unnecessary, and not silly."

Netrunner,39zvro,Bwob,1 point,Thu Jun 18 15:45:21 2015 UTC,"I had a deck with targeted marketing that I liked a lot - it was a variant on the old weyland-uncorrodable idea, but it basically used targeted marketing to discourage the runner from installing their corroder, (or whatever their barrier breaker was) and getting a big payout when they did.  It worked pretty well as a current because, if you have mostly barriers, its' really hard for them to score (and remove the current) without triggering it at least once.  And program destruction/will-o-wisp mean that sometimes the same one can even trigger more than once."
Netrunner,39zvro,cwoac,3,Tue Jun 16 18:54:40 2015 UTC,"I think it has reached the point where you have to think strongly before not including any of the currents, just from the need to counter to your opponent playing one, but only in the same way as having to tech against any other approach, rather than being a 'must include'.  They are powerful, but aides rather than something you would probably build a deck around (except maybe protesters in a valencia mass bad pub deck?)."
Netrunner,39zvro,coyotemoon722,4,Tue Jun 16 10:39:30 2015 UTC,I want Lag Time in Stronger Together to be good. I really do...
Netrunner,39zvro,PaxCecilia,2,Tue Jun 16 05:58:24 2015 UTC,"Good lord, I think that puts every playable Bioroid at or above 5 strength. Get a Brain Taping Warehouse out, now they are either spending a fortune getting through on their last click, or you're saving a huge amount of money to rez them :)  Then again, that one guy with e3 Feedback Implants + D4v1d totally ruins your day."
Netrunner,39zvro,vicvonshroom,1 point,Tue Jun 16 13:23:54 2015 UTC,"Eh, the fella playing E3 and D4v1d will only get certain accesses each turn(Maybe 1 or two). Heinlein Grid makes it a lot harder for them to do this.You can also Ryon Knight a few servers so if they run last clicks, they can get severely punished.I tried a ST deck with Lag Time and it worked just fine when I faced a runner willing to pay through, and even if they spend the clicks to break, that's a loss of clicks so limiting their actions every turn. It could work, it's just like a tier 1.5-2 deck."
Netrunner,39zvro,PaxCecilia,1 point,Tue Jun 16 14:40:30 2015 UTC,"When you're talking about ST with Lag Time, Ryon Knight, Heinlein Grid, the kitchen sink... You don't have ETF money, so you need a really solid economic base to pull off rezzing ice that is all 3+ in cost. Right now my economy is Hedge, Celebrity Gift, Eve, Adonis, and Brain Taping Warehouse. So there's 15 economy cards. 3 Jackson, 17 Ice, and 9-11 agendas, you're sitting at 3-5 cards and 6 influence of wiggle room. Yikes.  For what it's worth I've tried a few different variations of the deck, and that outline is by far the most stable. Celebrity Gift is usually a really good one because it lets you recover your economy to a good state if you've got an Adonis or Eve rezzed, and when you show them a hand full of Bioroids they're not going to be surprised :P"
Netrunner,39zvro,Pricklyman,1 point,Tue Jun 16 14:53:16 2015 UTC,It sort of is though. Well...sort of...  (Same way it's sort of good in a Cyberwalls deck.)
Netrunner,39zvro,Bwob,1 point,Tue Jun 16 11:32:34 2015 UTC,"Actually, the place I've found lag-time to be best is in a weyland deck using a lot of mid-range (STR 3-5) barriers, possibly coupled with superior cyberwalls.  Assuming your ice is all at least strength ~2, lag time is usually a +1 tax per ice, which mounts up pretty fast.  I think people under-rate how annoying that gets."
Netrunner,39zvro,SeaSourceScorch,1 point,Tue Jun 16 18:51:52 2015 UTC,I built a Stronger Together lag time + patch + sub boost deck a while back. An 8-strength Eli with three subs is a truly ridiculous thing.
Netrunner,39zvro,Saracenus,2,Tue Jun 16 19:47:08 2015 UTC,I have used Unscheduled Maintenance to great effect in some of my Leela builds. Mainly it was a response to ELP running amuck in my meta for awhile.  Nothing funnier than someone popping ABT's ability and can only lay down one ice. Kit would love it if influence were not so tight.   Cerebral Static is awesome if Whizzard/Ed builds are overrunning your meta. I did much the same when Maxx was the rage. Andy/Valencia turn it into a dead draw or kill the corp current only card unfortunately...  Love Lag Time in a NRE meta. But Power Shutdown seems like the better play.
Netrunner,39zvro,Vysetron,1 point,Tue Jun 16 15:44:06 2015 UTC,I really like Unscheduled Maintenance. It's a massive amount of control for one credit.
Netrunner,39zvro,RepoRogue,1 point,Wed Jun 17 13:13:27 2015 UTC,"Probably not the answer you want to hear, but it entirely depends on the deck. You listed probably the two most influential currents, and you're probably aware of how powerful they can be. I've lost games pretty much singlehandedly to ELP, since it just taxed so many of my clicks away. It isn't as good against decks with lots of run events, or decks which don't run as frequently, (There's a lot of overlap between the two, incidentally) but it can be a very high impact card. Hacktivist Meeting is in a similar boat; it can be game winning, or pretty mediocre.  Most of the other currents fit into pretty specific decks, and are less consistently high impact. (See: Housekeeping and Targeted Marketing.) Honestly, my problem with them is that they take up valuable deck slots which could be dedicated to cards which will either keep me from losing some of the time, or always be helpful."
Netrunner,39zvro,satellite_uplink,2,Tue Jun 16 03:28:15 2015 UTC,"Hey, the answer I wanted to hear was opinions, not some sort of definite answer. So, your response is what I wanted to hear. :-)"
Netrunner,39zvro,satellite_uplink,1 point,Tue Jun 16 13:29:01 2015 UTC,"Currents are becoming more important.  When a really good current (like Hacktivist Meeting) gets printed it finds its way into decks, and then one of the best ways of fighting back is to play your own currents.  They're becoming serious, I think.  I think Hacktivist Meeting is one of the strongest Anarch cards and maybe starts an arms race in Currents because it's the first current that is good enough you almost have to play it, and hurts the Corp enough that they almost have to fight back somehow (likely with Currents).  On their own a lot of Currents don't justify play but as opposing Currents get better your own Currents gain value and we're hitting that point now where Cerebral Static, Paywall Implementation and Net Celebrity start to see serious play.  Next behind them will be Lag Time (turns Lotus Field back on vs NRE) and then Surveillance Sweep looks very dangerous in Data & Destiny."
Netrunner,39zvro,nadinengland,2,Tue Jun 16 08:45:42 2015 UTC,"Right, this is one of the things that motivated this post -- I see them more often and sometimes don't have a good answer to them (if I'm still in the process of setting up and can't easily score out, for instance). Having currents in hand to shut off opponent currents is something I rarely consider doing, but might want to start."
Netrunner,39zvro,flamingtominohead,1 point,Tue Jun 16 13:30:17 2015 UTC,"Yeah it should be starting to be factored into your considerations.  Don't play a bad card just because it's a current, but if there's a card that's marginal and also a current then it should be starting to shout a little bit louder for inclusion.  That's why Net Celebrity or Lag Time come to mind, because they're kind of always a bit useful to have around.  Right now I think only Hacktivist Meeting is damaging enough to do that, but Surveillance Sweep will potentially join it on that list in the near future.  It's going to be interesting to see when Cerebral Static joins that equation because it can situationally wreck opponents (Whizzard, Noise, Leela, Maxx, Kit) while others only get grazed or don't care at all (Andromeda, Valencia, Kate).  If Whizzard is on the rise then RP might well have to play Cerebral Static as it fights both Hacktivist Meeting (already a problem) and Whizzard's ability (a big problem)."
Netrunner,39zvro,satellite_uplink,1 point,Tue Jun 16 13:49:51 2015 UTC,I agree with everyone else that they are high variance. As the corp sometimes I play a current only for them to top deck an agenda almost immediately. Other times Housekeeping wins me the game just by how much tempo the runner loses discarding cards they need and cards to replace them.
Netrunner,39zvro,Bwob,1 point,Tue Jun 16 09:29:46 2015 UTC,"I love using Housekeeping to slow down the runner, but unfortunately it doesn't fit into many decks due to the cost and influence."

I wonder how good the old PE decks would have been if they;d add that extra tax of 7 or 8 cards over the course of the game?  Unfortunately the PE deck also gave up stolen Agendas a lot, so the current wouldn't stick around long."

Netrunner,39yycp,RepoRogue,14,Mon Jun 15 22:43:38 2015 UTC,"I don't think you're wrong, but:  1) is a meta thing, not really a card pool thing, IMO.  In fact, I'd say that the rise of the current ""leave nothing unprotected"" slow decks is in large part due to Criminals themselves: they were so effective in that 'ecological niche' that decks which allowed them to exploit unprotected remotes couldn't survive.  2) There's an upcoming card that fixes this in the sixth pack.  I don't think this should even constitute a ""spoiler"" since it's in an official FFG announcement but whatever.  Regardless, this hole in the blue card pool is getting a patch.  3) and 4) are faction weaknesses.  One might as well say ""Shapers are bad because they can't trash or derez ice.""  Those are deliberate holes in the Shaper card pool to differentiate factions.  I'd be surprised to see Criminal get an AI breaker, and I don't think they ought to have one.  There's already Overmind, and e3 is in their own faction.  I would also be surprised to see Criminals get much recursion.  I've always gotten the impression that the Criminal point of view is ""recursion is for people who make mistakes."""
Netrunner,39yycp,SevenCs,6,Tue Jun 16 02:27:53 2015 UTC,"I've always gotten the impression that the Criminal point of view is ""recursion is for people who make mistakes.""   I love this!"
Netrunner,39yycp,desertfox14,3,Tue Jun 16 16:28:40 2015 UTC,"1.I totally agree with you.  2.That's true, I forgot about that card. That being said, I was trying to describe the current problems with playing Criminal, so the point stands for now.  3.and 4. Those are pretty glaring faction weakness, and your counter point is a pretty big strawman. Trashing and derezing ice are both good effects, but neither are relied upon by the vast majority of strategies. Getting in consistently and cheaply is something pretty much everyone wants, and being bad at that is a very big faction weakness. Frankly, I don't think Criminals have anything which makes up for such a glaring weakness.  As for recursion, I agree with you more or less. It definitely is supposed to be a faction weakness, and it's nowhere near as big of one as lack of consistently good breakers is, but it is a pretty big mechanic to have a faction completely lack. It's definitely intended, but also part of why Criminals are weak right now."
Netrunner,39yycp,Gammaran,4,Tue Jun 16 03:20:01 2015 UTC,"Criminals have the best events in the game, that is what covers their weakness. There is nothing that a Criminal wants very much other the breakers and draw. They already have shitloads of money and events. That is why sucker andy works, you just import a breaker suit and have the rest of influence to do as you wish"
Netrunner,39yycp,Gammaran,2,Tue Jun 16 05:12:39 2015 UTC,"Do they, though? Account Syphon is strong, but far less impactful than it used to be, since Corp economies are a lot more robust. Inside Job is good, but I'd almost always rather have an SMC. Forged Activation Orders is okay. Emergency Shutdown is solid, but somewhat meta dependant. Legwork is amazing, but also only two influence.  Andy Sucker isn't amazing right now, since it's effectiveness is dependent on being able to get in consistently and cheaply, which just isn't a reality against some of the most prevalent decks at the moment. They definitely have a lot of great native economy, but it's either fairly slow resource economy or faster run based economy, the later of which is hampered by decks which are great at making runs taxing.  Don't get me wrong, there are some great blue cards, but every faction has really strong cards, while Criminals are missing some pretty key pieces, especially for aggro and midrange decks."
Netrunner,39yycp,Gammaran,4,Tue Jun 16 06:02:15 2015 UTC,"Account Syphon is strong, but far less impactful than it used to be, since Corp economies are a lot more robust   It is still the best answer to keeping corps poor, the only other viable answer is Vamp. Its not the be all end all, but it has the potential to destroy the pace of a corp, it always will have that potential.   Inside Job is good, but I'd almost always rather have an SMC.   Inside job is relevant at pretty much all points of the game though, its a play making card, and SMC can be a dead card if you drew one of your breakers already, you have to choose either to play the breaker or run the SMC. Inside is more for early game where you dont have 11+ credits to bring a icebreaker and then break with SMC   Forged Activation Orders is okay.    Its imo better than just okay. The corp plays a different game when they know that if they ress that ice to keep you out, they risk losing some other ice of the board.   Emergency Shutdown is solid, but somewhat meta dependant.   Emergency Shutdown is another version of Account Syphon, you force the corp to spend credits in ways they didnt wanted to, and if they dont have the credits to support it then they lose. Criminal is all about throwing a wrench at the corps plans with their cash and using those chances.   Legwork is amazing, but also only two influence.   Idk, most decks can only affort to bring 1 of these, while you have the free reigns to run all that you want. Legwork wins games, and influence runs short, finding a spare 2 influence on any meta deck is hard to not say impossible.  Also you didnt mention special orders, which is a great tutor for icebreakers."
Netrunner,39yycp,satellite_uplink,2,Tue Jun 16 06:07:05 2015 UTC,"You're right about me forgetting Special Order, which is a good card. (I'd rather have SMC almost always, but it's still a good card.) FOA and Emergency Shutdown are quite good when your opponent is running big ice, but a lot of the best taxing ice is quite cheap to rez, (Eli, Pup, Pop-up Window, Enigma, etc) which renders it a far less impactful card against decks which run cheap taxing ice. This is important because my argument isn't the Criminals are bad, they definitely aren't, but that they struggle with consistency in the sense that they have a lot of powerful tools which are only useful in some matchups.  Compare this to PrePaid Kate, which runs cards that are strong pretty much always. This is the problem that specifically aggro and midrange Criminals face. Furthermore, having lots of strong events to make up for situational breakers would be fine if that was the only thing you're giving up. You're also giving up card draw, recursion, mid run tutoring, ice destruction, good R&D access cards, (something else Criminals have to import which I forgot about) and, for faster decks at least, consistent economy. (That being said, Criminals have easily the strongest early economy engines when they get off the ground and don't get shut out.)  Slow Criminal decks are really strong: the Supplier can make you insane amounts of money, rendering the inefficiency of Criminal breakers irrelevant. However, that sort of economy is very slow."

(That being said, Criminals have easily the strongest early economy engines when they get off the ground and don't get shut out.)   mid run tutoring is not fair to call criminals out on, since only one card in the game really does that. Its not like its a full archetype and Criminals are the only one missing out. Recursion is also done mostly by clone chips, since i rarely see deja vu anymore.  Criminals have great consoles which Shapers dont have, and while they dont have R&D lock, they hit the hand much harder, something no other corp really does, except for wanton ararch decks. Criminals have also pseudo draw with things like express delivery, and Earthrise hotel, which help the criminals get a steady supply of cards. I never found myself being short on money with criminals as long as you import a steady breaker suite, all the event money, neutral money and cards like security testing make criminals not to worry about cash at all points of the game, events like lucky find make you filthy rich if you can spare the influence.  The only events that are on par in the whole card game with criminal events is wanton and sometimes Test run, maybe knifed, spooned and forked, but those rely on you drawing them after having your breakers out. Makers eye is significantly weaker to Legwork.  And things like professional contracts are ""only 2 influence"" like you said about legwork, and Quality time is just ""1 influence"". Even thought i feel you can get enough draw from neutral cards and in faction criminal cards and just splashing a bit of cheap influence draw. Tutoring gets the criminals by, especially with Andy that starts with a huge draw headstart"
Netrunner,39yycp,Gammaran,2,Tue Jun 16 06:48:13 2015 UTC,"I think Criminals are actually in a pretty good place, but right now the type of players who will cold-bloodedly play 'the best deck' are playing Kate and relatively few players are underlying Criminal fans.  I think Express Delivery deserves a lot of love for card drawing/filtering and hasn't been mentioned, and Special Order is a great card.  So is Hostage.  It sounds like a lot of OP's argument was ""Shapers are good and the problems with Criminals is that they aren't as good at being Shapers as Shapers are""."

They can import a effective breaker suit for little influence and there is enough neutral draw, quality time its only 1 influence if you want draw so bad.

Netrunner,39yycp,the-_-hatman,1 point,Tue Jun 16 19:42:29 2015 UTC,"Getting in consistently and cheaply is something pretty much everyone wants, and being bad at that is a very big faction weakness.   Inside Job, Faerie, Siphon (can't rez ice when the Corp is broke) and general denial play, Shutdown... I think Criminals have, historically, had plenty of ways to get in cheaply and consistently.  Inside Job single-handedly thwarts agenda rushing because you've got to have 2 ice over a remote and be able to afford to rez both before you can realistically rush agendas against Criminal.  Shaper has SMC, which is typically an expensive play (2credit + install cost + using the breaker in question) but provides you with a long-term solution, while Criminal has Faerie/Inside Job/Crowbar & Spike -- which are, to my eye, functionally just program versions of Inside Job -- which will get you in right now, but cheaply.  And with Events like Legwork, Siphon, Shutdown, and so on, often all Criminals need is to get in right now."

Netrunner,39yycp,theuselessgeneration,7,Tue Jun 16 15:19:40 2015 UTC,"Did someone say late to the party?  I like a lot of your points, but I feel that most of them can be summed up by saying Criminals can make really big early-game gains, but are unable to turn that consistently into late-game strength. I'd also argue that this makes them weak to current strategies, which aggressively move forward to the mid-game. Now, some of this is poor play: keeping a corp broke for several turns and not checking HQ, for example. But economically, they're not in a great spot, and they're not great at avoiding flatlines. Both of these make the late game a slog.  I will say, I'm alright with criminals having crappy breakers for the most part, but their killers are awful. And this is the ice they're supposed to specialize in! Ninja isn't the worst, in terms of getting past big sentries, but they don't have a reasonable way to get past low strength, high sub sentries. Except maybe Femme. Femme costs 9, Mimic costs 3. Which one are you going to install first?"
Netrunner,39yycp,amightyrobot,2,Tue Jun 16 14:33:02 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the bad Killers thing makes me sad. The only Criminal breaker I regularly export is Femme."
Netrunner,39yycp,Bwob,3,Tue Jun 16 15:16:26 2015 UTC,"Criminal Killers are bad, but here's the thing - everyone else's are worse.  That's one of the traits of Sentries - they're obnoxious to break.  There usually isn't a cheap way around.  Mimic is only tolerable when you combo it with other cards.  Things like Gordian Blade or Corroder, you install, and can say ""ok, now I'm set for that type of ice for the rest of the game.""  Mimic can only do that when backed by an AI or some datasuckers."
Netrunner,39yycp,Xenasis,2,Tue Jun 16 21:18:46 2015 UTC,"The issue is that there really aren't that many common sentries which Mimic can't deal with. (At least where I play.) And Data Suckers and AI breakers actually do something for you besides just support Mimic. Furthermore, Mimic is very cheap, and so are Data Suckers, so the investment is a lot lower to get a more effective rig."
Netrunner,39yycp,Danwarr,2,Wed Jun 17 02:10:09 2015 UTC,"I honestly think that's the fault of the corp meta, not the runner.  Mimic is damn near universal, so who in their right mind would use str-3 sentries?  Sherlock of all cards is starting to heat up in the meta, and I won't be surprised to see other high strength sentries follow.  I feel like Cortex Lock has single-handedly changed the opening 5 turns simply because it's cheap and str-4.  As we get more cards that expoit a mimic-heavy meta, everyone will be turning back to the blue killers, bad as they are."
Netrunner,39yycp,Xenasis,4,Wed Jun 17 03:17:46 2015 UTC,"Cambridge Regionals had more Whizzards than Criminals. Yes this speaks volumes to the state of the meta with Whiz being a great play against the asset heavy RP decks as well that the weakness of criminals.   It seems like Connections were supposed to be the Criminal cards but nothing ever worked out. The cloud breakers that have been spoiled look interesting but don't help make the in faction breaker suite better.  Net Ready Eyes was huge for Anarchs as it allows them to go back to their in faction breakers and use influence on other tricks. The Criminals need something like that.  I have said it previously, instead of the neutral runners I would have rather seen another stab at Criminals in the next deluxe."

Netrunner,39yycp,PaxCecilia,1 point,Tue Jun 16 10:57:38 2015 UTC,"It seems like Connections were supposed to be the Criminal cards but nothing ever worked out.   I think that this is more because people haven't really explored this than because the cardpool is lacking.  Criminals with connections are insane.  It's just that account siphon is such a good card, and doesn't work well with them.  People have been trained to respect account siphon.  People haven't learned yet to respect criminal connection economy."
Netrunner,39yycp,AnalysisSitus,6,Tue Jun 16 21:14:51 2015 UTC,"The biggest problem is that Criminals aren't getting anything good like Anarchs/Shapers are. Criminals haven't really gotten any good cards for the past two cycles, H&P excluding (H&P gave Passport, Legwork, Sec Test). Some recent examples (though there are many) include Titanium Ribs, Dorm Computer, Power Tap, the new breaker 'suite', they seem to just be getting a bunch of garbage and nothing that's actually good.  The Supplier could have been start of a cool new archetype, but FFG haven't pushed it to the point of being good yet.   In short: just give Criminal some good cards. They're the only faction that's still splashing for all of their breakers and FFG seem to print all of their joke cards in Criminal."

As far as the SanSan cycle is concerned, of the cards released to this point Career Fair is probably the best but not in your typical Criminal deck. It works much better in Anarch and Shaper decks. Dorm Computer is at least ""ok"" given its cost to play and it's niche role. Given the rise of Butchershop style decks maybe people start including 1? Though, this goes back to deck slots being tight.  Looking at the known spoilers of the rest of the SanSan cycle, it doesn't look like Criminals are getting help anytime soon."

Good luck breaking Hives or Curtain Walls with that. I did some pretty rough maths, and it's better to click for a credit than install any of these if you've got a breaker suite already, and you can't run these without another breaker suite. There are too many ifs, buts, and cards that stop you for them to be worth your time and money (literally) to install them.   As far as the SanSan cycle is concerned, of the cards released to this point Career Fair is probably the best but not in your typical Criminal deck. It works much better in Anarch and Shaper decks.   It's one of those cards that was released for Anarch in the Criminal faction, like Cache. Some Criminal decks are slotting one Career Fair, but that's it. There aren't really enough good targets.   Dorm Computer is at least ""ok"" given its cost to play and it's niche role. Given the rise of Butchershop style decks maybe people start including 1? Though, this goes back to deck slots being tight.   Not really, it's too narrow. Against Butchershop, you're shooting yourself in the leg by installing it. They will still Midseason or SEA Source you. I'd rather have Easy Mark in my deck than Dorm Computer against Butchershop.  Even in a meta with ~25% tagstorm, that card wouldn't be worth the slots. People tend to get really excited about cards that marginally hate on a particular archetype, but it turns out you should still play cards that are good against as many as possible."

But like you said, I'm not super hopeful that it's going to be T1 or even T2 really.  I agree that Dorm Computer is super narrow. I was just more implying that in the past, FFG would've made something like Dorm Computer cost maybe 2credit to install which would've have made it far worse than it is now.

Netrunner,39yycp,Bwob,1 point,Tue Jun 16 21:22:01 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I think Pipeline is in a significantly better place than FoN. At 3 credits, its nearly something you can throw down as a just-in-case thing, and killers are also considered the most expensive. I think FoN could have filled a similar niche, and at risk of redesigning entirely, I think it could have been 1 cred install if it was 2 credit to increase strength by 1 as well."
Netrunner,39yycp,Xenasis,1 point,Tue Jun 16 21:58:04 2015 UTC,"Pipeline's 2-to-raise-strength (plus its base strength of 1) puts it in a kind of awkward spot vs. a lot of common sentries though -   Galahad is going to cost you 3-5 credits, based on the # of subs. A humble neural katana is going to run you 5 credits, for the few people who still run them. Tsurugi costs you 6. Cortex Lock will run you a painful 7 credits. Ichi is 8-9 based on how many subs you need to break. Grimm is 9 credits to survive unscathed Archer will run you a whopping 14 credits to get through with pipeline.   In contrast, Force of Nature has a high up-front cost, but after that, it is always within 1 credit of zu.13.  (Either identical costs, or 1 more expensive.)  Honestly, I think I'd take force of nature before I'd take pipeline.  They're only 2 credits difference on the install, but the costs for actually using pipeline mount up really fast.  Femme's 1 strength bonus makes a huge difference here.  (As well as the obvious ability to ignore something troublesome.)"
Netrunner,39yycp,Bwob,1 point,Tue Jun 16 22:16:03 2015 UTC,"I won't argue Pipeline is stellar, but I'd also argue that most other killers are also pretty expensive. Femme is only 2c cheaper, so Cortex Lock is still 5c, and Grim is still 7c. Pipeline really isn't horrible. However, Shapers have a much ""oh shit""-button for sentries in Sharpshooter(+Deus Ex)."
Netrunner,39yycp,Xenasis,1 point,Tue Jun 16 22:31:29 2015 UTC,"Oh sure, lots of breakers get better in combos.  Pipeline + deus ex + sharpshooter keeps you pretty safe.

Netrunner,39yycp,Bwob,1 point,Tue Jun 16 22:46:12 2015 UTC,"I'm going to suggest heresy here: since the cloud breakers are great vs low strength ice, why not drop in things like Peacock, Aurora, and Ninja?

Netrunner,39yycp,Xenasis,2,Tue Jun 16 21:24:37 2015 UTC,"Really?  Off the top of my head, they've got:   Consoles like Desperado, Box-E, or Logos, depending on the deck.  You basically always want some console. Decoy is still one of the best ways around to avoid tags, whether or not you're doing supplier shenanigans. Mr. Li offers crazy capability to dig for cards you need Tri-Maf contacts are basically in-faction, non-unique Kati Jones clones.  Sure, you have to avoid getting tagged and killed, but criminals have by far the most anti-tagging tech. Zona Sul Shipping is one of the best drip economy cards available to runners at the moment, requiring no other cards to combo with it aside from maybe some tag protection.   And of course there are a bunch of neutral cards that exist also, which are frequently seen in all sorts of decks, but that again, do particularly well in a supplier-based economy:   Neutral hardware like Plascrete or PPVP are always handy Kati Jones herself probably counts, if you don't feel like dealing with the threat of meat damage from Tri Mafs. Daily Casts become net 7 credit gains, when played from the supplier. Earthrise Hotel is 6 cards for 2 credits when suppliered. Underworld Contacts or Data Folding are 0 or 1 credit each, if you're going for a drip economy of some sort. Being resources, all the shards benefit greatly from the supplier, if you find yourself unable to play them from a run.   There are tons of good cards to use with the supplier.  The issue isn't that there isn't card support.  The issue is that people are just sitting around and saying ""oh no, the only way I knew to play criminal no longer works everywhere, so clearly the faction is in trouble"" rather than building new deck types."
Netrunner,39yycp,Bwob,2,Tue Jun 16 21:51:52 2015 UTC,"Consoles like Desperado   This is good, but order dependent, and you get marginal benefit when you're installing Desperado in a turn later if you want to run at all during the turn (you usually do).   Decoy is still one of the best ways around to avoid tags, whether or not you're doing supplier shenanigans.   Is it? The main way you get tagged these days is Midseason Replacements, and installing Decoy is (a lot) worse than clicking for  a credit against that card. Decoy is very bad against Breaking News, too. All around, worse than Plascrete. Even if you always get it for 0c.   Mr. Li offers crazy capability to dig for cards you need   But still worse than QT or Earthrise.   Tri-Maf contacts are basically in-faction, non-unique Kati Jones clones.    Tri-Maf's pretty good, though not really comparable with Kati. They're good, but the downside is real, and you will die to it from Butchershop, Weyland, or Breaking News from anywhere. Sure, you can install cards to not die to it, but at that point, it's not worth it. Forces you to remove Siphon tags, too. Most resources encourage removal of Siphon tags, but you don't die if you don't.   Zona Sul Shipping is one of the best drip economy cards available to runners at the moment   It's far too much of a tempo hit to play, and again it's an example of a card that isn't good enough to see any play at all normally. It's a big joke against Butchershop and Breaking News.   Kati Jones herself probably counts, if you don't feel like dealing with the threat of meat damage from Tri Mafs.   She's an econ option different to the reason you're playing the deck.   Earthrise Hotel is 6 cards for 2 credits when suppliered.   It's also a turn slower.   Neutral hardware like Plascrete or PPVP are always handy   Plascrete is kinda fine, but waiting a turn for it is a bit dodgy. You don't want Prepaid in a deck that wants lots of resources and Hardware.   Daily Casts become net 7 credit gains, when played from the supplier.   This is the only really good one.   Underworld Contacts or Data Folding are 0 or 1 credit each, if you're going for a drip economy of some sort.   Only marginally fine at best if you draw all of the cards you need, but is prone to having cases of drawing its deck in the wrong order.   There are tons of good cards to use with the supplier. The issue isn't that there isn't card support. The issue is that people are just sitting around and saying ""oh no, the only way I knew to play criminal no longer works everywhere, so clearly the faction is in trouble"" rather than building new deck types.   It's not that people are afraid to try a deck, it's that there's no reason to play this deck. It doesn't have any better matchups than Prepaid Kate. Though aggressive Criminal is still overall worse than Prepaid Kate, it has some matchups that it's better at, which is nice and means it can be a (extremely unlikely) meta call.  It's not that there's some secret technology that nobody has thought of yet. The deck's fine and you can probably win a GNK with it, but it's nowhere near good enough for tier one play. People try new stuff all the time, and it's easy to sit loftily and say that nobody but you will try something, but some things either aren't good enough [for tier 1 play] or aren't worth trying because the maths just isn't good enough [for tier 1 play]. The best players will always find the best decks.   FFG printing more bad Criminal resources doesn't help anyone.

I'll admit that the recent crop of NBN decks that try to land 2 or more on you for traffic accident is a bit more of a problem, so maybe these are less useful now.    Mr. Li offers crazy capability to dig for cards you need   But still worse than QT or Earthrise.   That's an odd comparison.  That's like saying ""sure, Magnum Opus gives you good money, but it's still worse than Lucky Find.""  They do different things.  QT and Earthrise are limited bursts of cards.  Mr. Li lets you convert 1 click into a 2-card deep dig on your heap as much as you want.   Tri-Maf's pretty good, though not really comparable with Kati.   Sure they are.  You have to pump kati for 3 or more turns before you get better than 2c/click out of her.  In most games, kati has slightly better efficiency that tri-maf, at the cost of not being able to access that money until you specifically ask for it.  But at the end of the day, they're still both cards that give you ~2c per click, once per turn.  One is just unique, instead of hurting you when trashed.   They're good, but the downside is real, and you will die to it from Butchershop, Weyland, or Breaking News from anywhere.   You rarely die to them vs. Weyland (at least if you have decoys ;) or even non-meatdamage focused breaking news, but you're probably right about butchershop at the moment.  The decklist that I was using to tear up weyland back in O&C days is in serious need of revamping, I fear.  You're being really selective about what things the 1-turn delay bothers you on.  (ex:  Why is it a problem on earthrise and not daily casts?)  It's like - yes, supplier imposes a 1-turn telegraphing on your installs, in exchange for 2 credits per turn, and acting as a click bank.  In most cases, that's a non-issue, especially since most of the cards we're talking about here have longterm payouts anyway.   It's not that there's some secret technology that nobody has thought of yet.   If there was, how would you know?   The best players will always find the best decks.   How would you know if they didn't?  Seriously, go back through stimhack's list of tournament winning decklists, and look for the first time each new archetype showed up.  Cambridge Jinteki.  RP.  Redcoats.  etc.  Then look at when that deck became possible, cardpool-wise.  You'll find that in most cases, there's around a 4-6 month lag time between when cards are released, and when tier-1 decks catch up with them.  ""If there were better decks, pros would be using them"" is a statement that is not just laughable, it is  empirically false.   FFG printing more bad Criminal resources doesn't help anyone. They should either print cards that aren't resources or good resources to make the archetype actually good.   Honestly, the fact that FFG is printing them is I think more of an argument that they ARE good, and we just haven't figured out how to make good use of them yet.  They've done an astonishingly good job of keeping the game balanced and interesting, so if our choices are ""we just haven't figured something out"" and ""they suddenly forgot how to netrunner"", it seems pretty likely to be the former..."

NEH was played as soon as it was released. Andromeda was played as soon as she was released. MaxX, Valencia, Leela were played as soon as they were released. The Whizzard deck that's going about is only being played because NRE being just released makes him good.

There's also something you're not considering: decks like Headlock Reina started being good after The Valley, and though it did give her some nice additions (Pancakes or Baby), it only got popular because of Clot, NEH was significantly worse and RP was most of the meta.

Now look at the list, and realize that every card in the original cambridge jinteki deck had been out for like 4 months when it became big.

People didn't suddenly start playing criminal or NBN differently when those cards came out.  They just replaced Gabe with Andy, and kept doing the same thing.  You might have an argument for MaxX, but for the vast majority of new archetypes, the data is on my side.   There's also something you're not considering: decks like Headlock Reina started being good after The Valley, and though it did give her some nice additions (Pancakes or Baby), it only got popular because of Clot,    Headlock Reina became viable because of one specific card:  Eater.

Decks appearing 'late' is more like a deck appearing when it's best.   The meta clearly has some effect, but I think the meta has been diverse enough, for most of netrunner's lifespan, that very few decks become popular only because they have one particularly good matchup.  Decks become good when people figure out how to get their pieces working together well enough to deal with basically any threat out there - not just the specific threats of one or two decks.

You're grossly underrating the power of The Future Perfect, Mental Health Clinic, and Pup.

And sure, NEH and Andromeda got PLAYED when they were released, but that's because they just got slotted in over existing archetypes.   This is wrong. When NEH was released, the dominant NBN archetype was Making News with Midseason, either Psycho or Scorch, but one of the two. AstroBiotics existed, but it was nowhere as good as with NEH's bonus influence and a relevant ability (unlike TWIY*).   They just replaced Gabe with Andy, and kept doing the same thing.   You're wrong if you think that Gabe decks should have (or do have) exactly the same cards as Andy decks. They're vastly different in playstyles.

Headlock Reina is largely good because the best Corp is RP. It's really horrible against a field of ETF. Reina wouldn't be good if Eater didn't exist OR RP wasn't the best Corp deck.   Yeah, I checked too. Now look at the list, and realize that every card in the original cambridge jinteki deck had been out for like 4 months when it became big.   Mushin no Shin, Psychic Field, The Future Perfect, Pup, Philotic, House of Knives all say you're wrong.    (Heck, ask around this subreddit and you'll find no shortage of people who swore by it.)   You can find plenty of people that swear by bad decks, but that doesn't mean they win big tournaments with them. There's significant value in good decks that haven't been seen before, and they usually wreck tournaments pretty quickly if undiscovered and good enough.  In all of these cases, decks got good because they got good support. You can point to their past iterations all you'd like (where they have worse cards in them and weren't as good), but that doesn't help prove your point. In all cases, decks get good when they get good. You can say things like ""I think PE was good all along!"", but truth be told, it's completely wrong, Honour and Profit was an incredible boost to the faction. You might think that cards like House of Knives, Philotic, The Future Perfect, Pup etc aren't very good, but in such a case I think your card evaluation isn't great.  There's not much point continuing this discussion. I assure you, the decks that became good only became good exactly when they were good. Decks like RP and PE being good after an amazing bunch of Jinteki cards were released isn't a coincidence, and it's foolish to think it is."
Netrunner,39yycp,TonyStellato,3,Wed Jun 17 00:22:42 2015 UTC,"We can stop arguing and agree to disagree, (and I agree, it sounds like we're probably not going to get anywhere useful) but your misrepresenting several of my points, and your several of your dates are wrong.  (Example:  H&P came out in April of last year, Cambridge Jinteki debuted in July.)  I'm claiming that 3-month lag period as support for my point - it takes time for people to realize how to use new cards.  Most decks become good long before they get on the community's radar.  (You do seem right about astrobiotics though.  This may be a quirk of our local meta, or it may just be my memory failing, but I thought astrobiotics was used even before NEH, but if it was, it wasn't winning very many tournaments - I only found one pre-NEH winner that was using biotic labors instead of scorched earth.)"
Netrunner,39yycp,SevenCs,3,Wed Jun 17 00:47:48 2015 UTC,"I was the only top 8 criminal at the last regionals I attended. In total there were VERY few in the entire event (34 people). Didn't see any other Andy's, but probably 1 or 2 more at most. Very sad, I'd love to see new playable cards to boost the faction. The problem is not that they are weak, it's that they are unpopular because they don't change much. And their big box sucked"
Netrunner,39yycp,TonyStellato,12,Tue Jun 16 04:30:03 2015 UTC,"We got two years of criminal dominance. Ok, now, the last 3-4 months has seen the criminal falling a bit behind but they are nowhere near the same kind of low shaper were before C&C or Anarch before O&C. Give us a fucking break :/"

Netrunner,39yycp,McCaber,1 point,Tue Jun 16 17:54:34 2015 UTC,"why can't all three factions be equally as exciting? Why does one have to be behind? Also, Criminals don't get good/fun new cards. Pre-O&C Anarch's still got Cache (hah, I know), and D4V1D. Pre-C&C Shapers still got Test Run, Dino, Workshop, RDI. I just want some fun new stuff to play with, and the last many packs have been terrible. Giving us cloud breakers one at a time is literally the worst thing they could have done for the faction. Way to make the faction do literally nothing for a handful of months."
Netrunner,39yycp,Vysetron,2,Tue Jun 16 17:53:58 2015 UTC,"why can't all three factions be equally as exciting? Why does one have to be behind?   Because it's an LCG?  If Anarchs had 10/10 strength, Shapers had 9.5/10 strength, and Criminals had 9/10 strength, they would still be 'behind.'  It's unrealistic to expect that all 3 factions will be at perfectly equal levels of power throughout the lifetime of the game; there's going to be ebb and flow both from the influx of new cards as well as metagame shifts.  Criminals aren't nearly as bad off as Shapers and Anarchs used to be.  There are still Andi/Leela decks taking Regionals.  They're still strong, they're just no longer the strongest.  For now."
Netrunner,39yycp,sigma83,1 point,Tue Jun 16 19:45:18 2015 UTC,"But those numbers are meaningless and subjective.

I want a new something to derez ice, or more bypass effects. Where's the good stuff?!"
Netrunner,39yycp,Vysetron,2,Tue Jun 16 19:59:41 2015 UTC,"Synthetic Blood, Gene Conditioning Shoppe, London Library, Tyson Observatory, Analog Dreamers.  Shapers got so many cool new tools! ;)   I want a new something to derez ice, or more bypass effects. Where's the good stuff?!   Short answer?  The cloud suite/the Underway.  There's an upcoming derez card, and the cloud suite are basically ""Inside Job:  Program Edition,"" to my eye.  Unfortunately I think this stuff won't come fully into its own until The Underway.  Similarly Career Fair is actually pretty good, IMO, but currently people aren't running decks that really want it.  I think the Underway will be the pack that puts Criminals back on the upswing, but we'll know for sure next month..."
Netrunner,39yycp,sigma83,2,Tue Jun 16 20:10:35 2015 UTC,"Fair point about Career Fair (I do like that card, even if it's hard to fit into current decks). I don't want to judge cards based how they WILL be once x and y comes out. Also, London library is great! It's not going into PPVP kate but it's a very fun shaper card that makes sense in some old school big breaker decks.  I have been telling myself that criminals will be fun again once Underway comes out, so I hope the new tools pay off"
Netrunner,39yycp,The11thNomad,5,Tue Jun 16 20:16:30 2015 UTC,"I'll maintain that Andy is always going to be solid. A 9 card opening hand and 1 link will never not be good.   That being said Criminal could definitely use some love, at the very least in the draw department. Special Order is a great card but you still have to draw the damn thing. I've had Ken games where I'm missing a crucial piece of my rig for almost the entire game. That's substantially less likely to happen with non-blue cards.  I want to say the cloud suite is going to breathe some life into criminal and make it more consistant, but there's so many moving parts to it that it seems like a completely different animal.  TL;DR: I would like blue cards that let me get more blue cards like the green and red cards can please thank you"

Netrunner,39yycp,Bwob,2,Tue Jun 16 05:07:45 2015 UTC,"True, but my problem with it is that you only get 3 account siphons in a game. Usually I play a single one early on, and/or chain 2+ in the mid/late game. Both of these options are usually viable.  Investing resources in seeing one earlier trough planned assault, is often not worth the deck slot if this means denying me the option of chaining in the late game.  Tutoring for an inside job is mostly just expensive if you ask me."
Netrunner,39yycp,ayylmao31,2,Tue Jun 16 07:15:42 2015 UTC,"I was being mildly facetious, but the ability to tutor the run event of your choice: Legwork, Vamped, Maker's Eye, Indexing, Retrieval Run (remember how screwed criminals are for recursion?) Running Interference, etc - is very powerful. It's the right tool at the right moment, which I'm aware is a very Shaper kind of mentality, but that doesn't stop it from being good."
Netrunner,39yycp,Bwob,1 point,Tue Jun 16 08:57:21 2015 UTC,"for the amount of money and events criminal have, they should not have draw on top of that. Every runner shouldnt have all the answers in faction. Criminal strength is in having the best run events in the whole game and making the money to keep running them. You should ask to enhance those strengths, not to cover your flaws."
Netrunner,39yycp,Horse625,2,Tue Jun 16 05:08:23 2015 UTC,"I think there are some spoiler things coming that are going to be awesome for criminals as strong early game tools. And the new cloud breakers should combo with the drip econ connection tools to be solid against slower decks, depending on your meta call.  Honestly, the biggest problem with criminals right now competitively? People aren't playing them as much as MaxX and Kate.  Check out: http://sansanfrancisco.net/2015-santa-clara-ca-regionals-results/ Obviously anecdotal, but it's a big field. And 1/2 of the top 8 were running criminals."

Netrunner,39yycp,BlueSapphyre,2,Tue Jun 16 23:38:09 2015 UTC,"I've been playing a Leela deck lately that has been bananas.  Yes, it does rely on an open server for a fair bit of econ (failing that, there is Gorman Drip or Sure Gamble/Lucky Find). But, econ is only the beginning. Johnny Boy lets me draw a card, but I'm talking about more than that...   Enhanced Vision is a fantastic card. For one credit on install, I can expose a card from HQ on a successful run ANYWHERE. And if I should bother with the Gene Shoppe (and why not? Baby gives me econ/draw power!), make that TWO exposes. People may still love Desperado. Yeah yeah yeah, that's great. But can I just throw in a good word for Doppleganger? Think about it. Nowadays, with just one click and enough rig, you can get four creds (Sec Testing), a card (Johnny Boy), expose two cards (Enh Vision), add on two Sucker tokens, AND rig a Hemorrhage to KO a card from HQ to slap that Sea-Scorch combo out of the sky. Oh, and did I forget something? Ah, of course! It'll combo with Dirty Laundry, Three Steps Ahead, possibly Pheromones if you can make an HQ run...   I'm into Criminals at the moment, and I'm determined to make that Dopplejank."
Netrunner,39yycp,Danwarr,2,Wed Jun 17 02:18:21 2015 UTC,Criminals have a weak glacier matchup.  Anarchs have a strong glacier matchup.  Switch it for rush.  Just wait.

Netrunner,39zztn,myth84,8,Tue Jun 16 03:54:45 2015 UTC,"It looks like it may not have been his fault? There were a few disconnect messages before the final one, if it's a rage quit you'll only get the ""left the game.. on purpose"" one.   Sidenote, when a server disappears the run is neither successful nor unsuccessful, so Autoscripter doesn't trash."
Netrunner,39zztn,squogfloogle,2,Tue Jun 16 04:12:26 2015 UTC,"Hmm, ok.  Did seem quite suspicious he left.  And yeah, I wasn't going to try and have him trash autoscripter.  I didn't understand why he quit over something that didn't matter."
Netrunner,39zztn,RestarttGaming,6,Tue Jun 16 04:28:23 2015 UTC,"FYI, autoscripter DOES NOT trash itself on a run where jackson collapses the server.  A collapsed server DOES NOT result in an unsuccessful run.  From the FAQ: If a server ceases to exist during a run, the run immediately ends. Unless the run has passed step 4.4 of the timing structure of a run, it is not considered to be successful or unsuccessful.  Cases like these are why people should try to be as familiar with the game as possible before traveling to OCTGN.  Also, OCTGN tells you, very certainly, ""so and so has closed the game on purpose - they did not disconnect""  if someone leaves the game.  So it looks like he either legitimately disconnected or went to the trouble of running to his router and shutting it off, but he didn't just quit."
Netrunner,39zztn,RestarttGaming,1 point,Tue Jun 16 09:22:17 2015 UTC,"I am well aware and never asked or expected him to trash AutoScripter.  I know the rules quite well.  I even mentioned it seemed he left the game over nothing - it didn't matter.  It's possible HE thought autoscripter had to be trashed.    It also shows in the log that he ""left on purpose""."
Netrunner,39zztn,RestarttGaming,1 point,Tue Jun 16 13:19:52 2015 UTC,"Just wanted to make this clear to everyone who looks at the screenshot, as autoscripter WAS trashed in the screenshot.  I'm not making a dig at you, i'm letting everyone know what happened in the screeenshot was wrong.  It shows he closed his game window - after disconnecting twice and being kicked by the host.  I think after you're kicked and DC'd theres no reason to leave the window open."
Netrunner,39zztn,squogfloogle,1 point,Tue Jun 16 13:44:49 2015 UTC,"Oh wow, I didn't even notice in the log that AutoScripter got trashed until just now.  That probably explains it then.  So how do you do that in OCTGN?  If I declare the run successful (F3) then any successful run abilities trigger when they shouldn't.  Do you just have to fix those Jackson issues manually?"
Netrunner,39zztn,neutronicus,1 point,Tue Jun 16 14:11:20 2015 UTC,"As far as I know, yes.  Someone more pro at OCTGN might know a way, but i just have them replay their autoscripter for free."

Netrunner,39zztn,Mark5n,2,Tue Jun 16 21:11:52 2015 UTC,I bet he disconnected and reconnected but the game was FUBAR so he just left.  Happens all the fucking time on OCTGN (disconnect / reconnect hosing your game I mean).
Netrunner,39zztn,song_without_words,2,Tue Jun 16 15:18:34 2015 UTC,"Yeah, hopefully he did not disconnect on purpose. I've had someone rage quit on me maybe 1% of the time, probably less.  I had a similar experience from his side of the table when I first started playing (both ANR and OCTGN). I Indexed, then ran back on R&D to scoop up a juicy agenda. My opponent popped JH, which had previously been rezzed but which I ignored because I had never seen it used to defend against Indexing (nor had I imagined it could be used for that). Just then, my internet connection failed. I got back in OCTGN asap, and my opponent whispered to me, asking if I had quit on purpose. I was glad to have the chance to explain that (1) no way would I do that, and (2) I was happy to see that move, because now I have a new tool at my disposal and I'm a better player for it.   tldr: The vast majority of people are cool to super cool."
Netrunner,39zztn,firefrenchy,2,Tue Jun 16 15:22:43 2015 UTC,Props for removing the names - it was probably a valid disconnect.
Netrunner,39zztn,Stonar,1 point,Tue Jun 16 23:59:00 2015 UTC,"Hmm. I cannot say for sure whether they quit on purpose or not, but I can say that Jackson vanishing and leaving the run serverless happens all the time. Like, constantly. So, to be angry about something like that happening, you'd need to not really know how the game works, and not have much experience with it. Barring that, I'd assume just a normal disconnect for whatever mechanical reason."
Netrunner,39zztn,Rejusu,1 point,Tue Jun 16 05:07:33 2015 UTC,"I remember playing my first few games on octgn, I think I had ""octgn newb"" as part of my game name for a good 20 or so games before I felt I knew all the relevant stuff well enough to not have to worry about it.

Netrunner,39x4og,Friendly_Jackoclypse,10,Tue Jun 16 14:25:36 2015 UTC,"I hate cards like this. It can end the run, it gains a cred in Nisei Division, it supports Tennin, and it's totally, totally unplayable. It doesn't tax any major code gate breakers for more than 3 (zu's 3, gordian and passport are both 2, yog just laughs, cy-cy breaks for 1), so it needs to come down early as gear-checking ICE, but rezzing it early costs enough that you want it to do something. And what it does is either drain your cash or let the runner in.   I suppose in Nisei that econ drain isn't such a big deal, but it still probably won't fire more than once or twice before the runner starts breaking it cheaply."
Netrunner,39x4og,nialbima,2,Mon Jun 15 15:16:08 2015 UTC,"i want to believe that some Public agenda is going to come out for Jinteki to run with this. Do one net damage when an advancement token is placed on this card, two if there are 5 or more advancement tokens. You can only use the advancement action once per turn?  even still... huh? I feel like this is prep for something later but not sure what would be worth the cost?"
Netrunner,39x4og,lynkfox,4,Mon Jun 15 15:18:05 2015 UTC,"Part of what bugs me is that it feels like the designers went ""okay.....nobody's playing the IDs from H&P all that much. Let's try to shift Jinteki away from RP a little by printing cards they can use."" And then they ran out of set space so they smushed some card ideas together and came up with this thing.  I'm usually inclined to believe that most mediocre cards can absolutely win a healthy number of games in the right deck, but the only thing i can think of that'd help here would be a Tennin ToL or Nisei Glacier running Akitaro Watanabe and like Wormhole or something I don't even know. It needs to be cheaper to have any shot of doing anything useful, and that's a terrible place for a piece of ICE to be in."

Netrunner,39x4og,neutronicus,5,Mon Jun 15 18:59:49 2015 UTC,"I just cannot see this card being used. A 3 str Code Gate with a single subroutine is pretty cheap to break. Even if it's not broken, it's a Psi Game, which can get very taxing if the runner just decides to run into it a few times.   The effect isn't that worth it either. It's not too often that you have something out there that is advance-able where one advancement is going to make a difference. If you're just looking for a psi-game to end the run, snowflake is much cheaper.  Also, it costs 4 to rez. Ouch."

Subroutines don't tend to fire all that often, psi ones will fire less. This is a silly card, from my point of view, but maybe I'm missing something."
Netrunner,39x4og,TonyStellato,4,Mon Jun 15 16:16:34 2015 UTC,I'd love the card if it was more like 2c to rez.
Netrunner,39x4og,saikron,1 point,Mon Jun 15 16:32:39 2015 UTC,"A lot of people are talking about the rez cost here. I think it's in line with what we've seen recently--Mamba didn't get a discount, and it seems well positioned--but it's not in line with, say Snowflake, which got a 2credit discount. You could argue that Bullfrog also had a 2credit discount, but it's pretty tough to make that argument either way.  I like the ice, but it might be overcosted; I'd have played it at 3credit, easily, and at 2credit I'd be much, much happier with it. Sure, most common breakers get by for cheap, but it's the same with Snowflake. Remember, at three advancements, most traps get extremely scary. (Except Ghost Branch. Who knows what to do there.)"
Netrunner,39x4og,the-_-hatman,2,Mon Jun 15 16:32:43 2015 UTC,"It's hard to compare this to Mamba and Snowflake. Mamba is a sucker+2 Mimic credits for 6, not bad. Snowflake is 2 Corroder credits for 1, pretty good trade, not great but fine. This is 0 Yog.0 credits for 4, terrible trade-off. Especially since Lotus Field is in faction and a ton better."
Netrunner,39x4og,BlueSapphyre,1 point,Mon Jun 15 17:25:41 2015 UTC,"I tend to look at how ice is priced relative to other ice, rather than how much each specific breaker takes to break it. I think it's easier to use that metric, rather than trying to figure out the stock of different icebreakers and factor that into how the ice works, especially now that there's enough punishment for not covering holes in your suite.   For example, if they're running Gordian blade, this is 2credits to break, which sets it at Snowflake levels with added utility. If they're running Zu or Passport, it's even better. It depends on the stock of icebreakers when and where you're playing. If everyone's playing Morning Star, your Elis all get broken for 1."
Netrunner,39x4og,the-_-hatman,1 point,Mon Jun 15 17:45:03 2015 UTC,"The important metric is how taxing the ICE is. Among the popular runner lists we need to look at their decoders (ignoring AIs for simplicity). So we have Kate that runs Cy-Cy and Gordian/Zu, Stealth Andy with Refractor or Zu, and Whizzard/Reg-Ass MaxX running Yog.0 (now with NRE).  If we want to compare 4 cost code gates, Lotus Field is the standard import seen in a lot of lists since it's not Yog.0-able, even with parasites and suckers (but NRE changes that). You're going to get an extra credit out of the runner if they're running Gordian/Zu, while Refractor is the same cost.  Now the only benefit is that Atman is usually set to 4, so this gets under Atman-4. But, this is a lot more porous than Lotus Field, because of the Psi game instead of a hard ETR."
Netrunner,39x4og,BlueSapphyre,2,Mon Jun 15 18:07:17 2015 UTC,"Lotus Field costs 5. It's not good because it taxes, though it does do that a bit, it's good because it checks to see if you have a hole in your deck. If you're looking for a credit taxing 4 cost code gate, Datapike's the go-to. And that's mostly equivalent to Clairvoyant Monitor.  You can absolutely argue Clairvoyant Monitor doesn't work in this environment. And you can absolutely argue that the Psi mechanic should come with a discount. But I don't see how you can argue that the ice cost needs to be proportional to its break cost, especially with code gates--the only thing that can be broken for literally 0 money."
Netrunner,39x4og,the-_-hatman,1 point,Mon Jun 15 19:58:19 2015 UTC,"Lotus Field is too expensive for a gearcheck, but it's still strength 4 for cost 5 which is a pretty good ratio. Yog is weird, but even in a non-Yog meta, Lotus Field would see play.  Datapike costs the runner 2 and ends the run. Clairvoyant Monitor (in the normal case) costs the corp 1 and ends the run. The advancement token is very rarely going to be worth the 3-credit swing. And when they do get a breaker out, one subroutine is cheaper to break than two.  Break cost isn't the only thing, but it's always going to be relevant - that's what ice is for, a lot of the time."
Netrunner,39x4og,m50d,1 point,Mon Jun 15 21:54:31 2015 UTC,"Placing an advancement token doesn't cost a credit, to my knowledge. (unlike advancing a card, which does)"
Netrunner,39x4og,taxable1,1 point,Tue Jun 16 15:44:34 2015 UTC,"Making Clairvoyant Monitor fire costs at least a credit on average, because the runner has the option of always bidding 0."
Netrunner,39x4og,m50d,1 point,Tue Jun 16 15:52:40 2015 UTC,But the other way to look at it is that snowflake forces the runner to spend 200% of its rez cost to get through whereas this thing forces the runner to spend 50%.
Netrunner,39x4og,disguise117,1 point,Tue Jun 16 00:40:07 2015 UTC,"Pretty underwhelming - it's a nice subroutine, good in Neisi and Tenin, even if Psi means it's less than certain to go off, but the ice it's attached to is pretty poor. Like they got the strength and cost the wrong way round or something.    Much like a lot of other Psi and Positional Jenteki ice, this one misses the mark, which is a damn shame."
Netrunner,39x4og,MrSmith2,1 point,Mon Jun 15 19:22:03 2015 UTC,"The upside is really good - end the run and saves you a click to advance, potentially lets you score out a 4 cost agenda in one turn. I don't think it can be played outside of Nisei Division though. Maybe a Nisei rush deck where you are relying hardcore on your Psi game skill to push through agendas behind this and Snowflake and Caprice before the runner has breakers."
Netrunner,39x4og,breakfastcandy,1 point,Mon Jun 15 22:38:37 2015 UTC,"Compare this to Snowflake. Same strength, more influence, higher rez cost, Code Gate vs Barrier.

Netrunner,39yys4,Pandemic21,7,Mon Jun 15 22:46:53 2015 UTC,"You have to make it clear the order in which unrezzed cards were installed, but otherwise don't have to tell them anything (e.g. if there are two facedown cards they could access and they ask which was the one you installed first, you have to answer truthfully).  Normally a runner would have to access all cards in a server if they access any, but with Gagarin they can choose before each access if they want to refuse to pay the additional cost of one credit, and then do not access that card if they don't pay."
Netrunner,39yys4,ademre,1 point,Mon Jun 15 23:56:00 2015 UTC,"Is that true about having to (at any time) tell the runner the order in which the facedown cards were installed?

Netrunner,39yys4,aschr,2,Tue Jun 16 13:21:16 2015 UTC,"I believe you have to tell the runner any time they ask but I could be wrong.  I also believe it is totally valid for, when asked what card they want to access, for the runner to say something like ""the first one installed""  EDIT: Official FAQ entry states   Can the Corp rearrange his installed cards within a single server, to obscure the order that he installed them in? The Corp must keep the order of his installs clear to the Runner, he cannot rearrange cards in servers however he likes.   Therefore I believe the order of installs is public information, just like how many clicks/credits you have left."
Netrunner,39yys4,ademre,1 point,Tue Jun 16 16:56:13 2015 UTC,"I feel this is the case. You are required to acknowledge what order they are being installed in as they are installed.

Edit: See azraelng's response below."
Netrunner,39yys4,ChainnChomp,4,Tue Jun 16 14:32:49 2015 UTC,"Drawn cards in HQ is not a good analogy here because the corp is allowed to hide the order in which cards have been drawn from HQ, they can shuffle their hand as much as they want.  The corp is not allowed to hide the order in which they installed cards in a server, at no point can you shuffle the face-down cards in a server."
Netrunner,39yys4,azraelng,1 point,Tue Jun 16 16:36:08 2015 UTC,"Fair enough. I suppose if you were permitted to shuffle installed cards, exposing cards in a server would be much less useful.

Netrunner,39yys4,ChainnChomp,2,Tue Jun 16 19:14:38 2015 UTC,"No you don't have to tell them which is the agenda.   Because it is Gagarin, then yes the runner can decline to pay the extra cost and only access some of the cards. Other wise they would have to access all"

Second, the runner will ""access"" the cards one at a time. HOWEVER, before each access, they must pay 1 credit.  If they decline, they will fail to access that card because they didn't pay the cost.

Now, it is normally fair to assume the runner is trashing snare, but there are circumstances (like industrial genomics or hostile infrastructure) where the trash cost can be increased, and you may not want/be able to trash the card.

The Corp isn't even poor or on 3 credits, where most threatening ice is turned off.  Komainu or neural +any agenda or trap is game.  Cortex + fetal is game .  Snare plus literally any damage ice or trap or agenda is game.  That's why I'm betting on I've had worse in hand.  It's pretty much the only time you consider running here.  If you know your opponent isn't dumb and wouldn't run without I've had worse here, you can either take them out for later by applying the damage, or just install the agenda via midori/architect and score it, since the runner is out of clicks"

What you know and what you don't at any given time is arguably the biggest aspect of netrunner.  What this test ought to ask is, given 8 credits, these cards in hand, and the runner running last click, what is the smart play? Is there a kill available given the information known to me? If I don't know the top 5 cards of R&D, the most cost effective play is to install Cortex Lock as it's a cheap way to deal 2 damage and force the runner to jack out. Installing Architect is a gamble--one which may or may not pay off.   Your last puzzle was slightly better on that aspect--occasionally I have played a deck long enough that when I'm down to 5 cards in R&D, I know exactly what those five cards are, but I still don't know what order they're in."
Netrunner,39wvnt,grimwalker,4,Mon Jun 15 16:26:41 2015 UTC,"To be fair, it is POSSIBLE to know the top 5 cards in R&D - precognition and architect are cards that exist.

But it IS possible to reach this state and know the information presented."

Netrunner,39wvnt,grimwalker,2,Mon Jun 15 18:04:19 2015 UTC,"In this situation the smart play is generally architect. They're running last click with no sentry breaker/SMC so if you see and install a 3/2 or 3/1 that's a guaranteed score next turn. And unless the top 3 cards are all agendas it also prevents them from stealing (unless that's what you want) where as they might just barrel through the Cortex Lock. After all if we're talking about this if it was an actual game we don't know what's in the runners hand, are they playing I've Had Worse?  Plus you get to install a card from HQ or, often more importantly, archives. Letting you bring back anything they might have already trashed. Oh and you get to see your next four draws. Honestly the only time Architect doesn't pay off is if you're supremely unlucky or it doesn't fire. Heck ignoring the fact that this is PE for a moment the worst case is you could see a bunch of agendas on top, Architect can still solve that by letting you install the Jackson Howard from hand which you can then fire to shuffle your deck before the runner can access.  Architect is just that good."

Netrunner,39wvnt,grimwalker,2,Mon Jun 15 20:33:07 2015 UTC,"Sorry but you are incorrect.  Corp only has 4 cards in hand, so couldn't have ended turn with too many cards.    Also archives doesn't have to stay in order, so pref could totally have been played last."
Netrunner,39wvnt,RestarttGaming,0,Mon Jun 15 20:37:34 2015 UTC,"You're right about the cards in hand, but the top card in archives is face down. The runner has not run Archives this turn so if Click 4 last turn had been Precognition, it would be visible in archives.  Theoretically anything is possible if people are willing to make shit up about the scenario in question."
Netrunner,39wvnt,grimwalker,2,Mon Jun 15 20:46:29 2015 UTC,"The top card doesn't have to be the last card played.  Many corps always put the face down cards on top, regardless of when they got into archives, for easier access and a less awkward pile."

Netrunner,39wvnt,RestarttGaming,2,Tue Jun 16 00:49:11 2015 UTC,While it might be tempting to use Midori to swap in the Cortex Lock to deal two damage and let them hit the snare for the kill any smart runner will probably jack out at this point. The better move is to switch in the architect instead and install the PAD campaign off the top of R&D making the next two cards they hit Snare and Philotic for a total of four net damage with PE's ability.  Little too easy I think.
Netrunner,39wvnt,Rejusu,1 point,Tue Jun 16 01:23:50 2015 UTC,"I think we have established this runner is not smart. Running last click versus PE with  1 no sentry breaker  2 no tutoring for a sentry breaker  3 with an unrezzed ice and upgrade  4 an R&D interface installed  They have a death wish, those facedowns could be almost anything, if the upgrade is the twins or ryon knight, the ice could be Komainu, Neural katana or Tsurugi and it would be fatal."
Netrunner,39wvnt,r2devo,1 point,Mon Jun 15 14:03:06 2015 UTC,True. But if the corp player isn't being dumb then the smart play is always architect. Whether they jack out or not you still benefit from it.

Alternatively: Midori Tollbooth -> Cortex Lock. 2 net damage - brings runner into ""quick  kill"" range with snare.

First off, what do you get for having the most points? Also, are you limited to play 'x' number of 'league games' per week or is it just who plays the most games can get the most points? Also do you all have a competitive scene in your area? I ask because our meta usually seems focused on tournament prep rather than switching between more than 2 decks in a given week. We're always talking about what could be the next big deck but in the limited card pool you can usually see if a deck will reach the bar set by decks like RP and PPVP Kate pretty easily.

Netrunner,39x26n,ElderMason,1 point,Mon Jun 15 16:33:55 2015 UTC,"Okay, let's go through each of your questions.  What do you do for having the most points? - We give out two prizes. One for whoever earns the most league points and one to whoever earns the most achievement points.  Are you limited to play 'X' number of league games per week? - Yes. Our limit is two games per opponent. So say there are 10 people in the league, each player would be limited to 18 games per week. Playing in a game gets you a league point and winning gets you an additional point.  Do you have a competitive scene in your area? - Yes. While we tend to keep our games pretty casual, there are three large tournament venues within driving distance of where we have our league. All of the league members participate pretty regularly. One member in particular usually places in the top 5 of tournaments.  Hope I answered well enough. If you have any more question, feel free to ask."

So if you had 2 cards in your grip, you could choose to steal 3 1-point agendas (one by one) and win before the 3rd Net Damage would flatline you.  This topic is covered in FAQ 2.0, p. 2:   Accessing Archives  When accessing cards in Archives, the Runner turns all cards faceup in Archives before accessing them. Then he or she accesses and resolves individual cards one by one, in any order he wants.  If the Runner uses a replacement effect, then he or she does not turn any facedown cards faceup."

Your suggestion is passive tag punishment for tag-me runners, which is an interesting idea which has not been really explored much as well. On the other hand, my suggestion is more two punishment ideas in one - an alternate way punishing the runner for taking the risk to be tagged in the first place, in exchange for not being able to interact with the tag in the future; and punishment for running into this early without preparation. The tempo/econ benefit of the runner accessing and trashing it is okay (-5c is fairly solid); but if e.g. accessed early game and protected a little afterwards, the runner has to find a way into that server to trash it instead of making other, more productive runs, if the runner doesn't want to cede economic advantage to the corp. It might well just be a blank get 2c/pay 5 to trash later on, when the runner has a bank; but that's not where this is supposed to be played out. The 2c benefit is generic, and probably can be tweaked to be stronger or replaced with other things.  I do not think analyzing any card in a vacuum does it justice :)"
Netrunner,39w7nm,nitori,1 point,Mon Jun 15 19:38:50 2015 UTC,"I cede that the cards do different things; I was trying to present a simpler card that is much more flexible while having a similar take on the conditional discount theme.  I'm not sure 2 creds when a successful run ends is worth the server. That's money you can't bank on and can't rez ICE with, after all. There's a fun situation where the runner hits this during an early Dirty Laundry thinking it might be JH. Aside from that window, which is arguably already narrowed because of DBS and/ or Marked Accounts, you must assume that you'll land a tag later and would rather rez this card with it than win the game.  Additionally, needing to land another tag for the next one makes this a card that combos poorly with itself. Contrast to, say, Sundew. Here, the runner has to give you the credits after they either blunder into it or take a tag.  Additionally, the presence of both additional costs and conditional cost waiving on the same card would certainly lead to a lot of head scratching around this one when it was first seen.  On the other hand, my suggested card can be in another server, gives you the credits earlier in the process [say, early enough for a Manhunt or an Ash] [though still not early enough for ICE], can be used in multiples on the same trigger, and has no seemingly self-conflicting text.  I'm interested to see what cards have a 'remove a tag' cost on them in the NBN big box. I'd also like to have a few games with you someday, as games with theorycrafters are always interesting."
Netrunner,39w7nm,Shteevie,1 point,Mon Jun 15 20:48:32 2015 UTC,"The tag cost is primarily for interaction with e.g. Snare!, Data Raven, other effects that land tags on the runner's turn. I was going for sacrificing tags for a 'limited' benefit, I guess? It also interacts favorably with Midseasons when you cannot win right away.  Importantly, it's not tag punishment as we would normally think of it, which your card is. Your card is certainly easier and likely easier to play with, but I was exploring a different unused design space, and I guess I'm more interested in that than immediate playability of a card. Our versions seem to be apples and oranges; the way each interacts with game flow is completely different, which is why I was a tad confused with your suggestion that it was a 'very complicated single-use click to gain 2c' card when the entire idea of it is about needing to bait interaction.   The power level of the card was intentionally stated to be undecided (I honestly do not have an idea how many credits to give per run); additionally, I do not really see the problem with the card comboing poorly with itself - many cards do, and this is a useful way to limit powerful effects as well. The ambush nature of the asset likely makes it so that I made it too weak, but as a core concept I do not think Sundew is really a fair relation.  I do think that the alternative cost and conditional cost make it more difficult to parse; I am unsure it makes it difficult enough so much so that it's unprintable. I would argue that things like IT Department are more confusing at first glance. Like, the card text itself says ""ignoring all costs"", and ""as an additional cost""; and it's not like the game doesn't have these interactions already with Oversight AI or Prireq etc with Archer. I will concede that I was being probably too fancy with the card, as it has two novel things - tags as resource, and free rez on access, both of which are logical extensions but new to the current Netrunner card pool. That said, I think the free access removing the tag requirement is interesting enough - rezzing it requires interaction, either via access or tags  - as well as allowing a lower credit cost, which I think is important to the design.  Tags as resources as you described are also interesting and I thought about it a bit as well (trading the more threatening and flexible tag for a more durable asset), but as the game currently stands, tags are too powerful for that - it makes no sense to, as you say, not just straight up win, rather than playing around with tags for assets. That's partially why I settled on the current rez cost that allows usage of tags on the runner's turn.  What do you think would be an appropriate advantage for each successful run? I was thinking about going up more credits, but I am a bit concerned about whether it creates unfun lockdown scenarios, and I would prefer (for concept purity's sake, at least, for this design) to not meddle with the runner directly with this card. Thinking about it, I could probably bump up the credit on successful run to 3-4.  (fwiw originally I had the trash cost at 6-7, but could not find a 6-7 trash cost card to copy the image from, so I settled at 5)  EDIT: Perhaps we can play a game one day, at least after my exams are over :)"

Hacksaw Criminal - 3 Inf Program - AI - Icebreaker - Trojan Strength 3 9c - 2  Install only in the root of a remote server.  Trash this card when it is the only card in the server and there are no cards protecting this server.  When you make a successful run on a remote server, instead of accessing cards, you may install this card from your grip in the server's root, ignoring all costs.  3c: +2 Strength.  1c: break ice subroutine on a card protecting this server.    Inspired by a previous custom card thread, this is my first attempt at Criminal trojans.    Sys.136 is essentially a permanent Femme that is often more expensive to use and takes up more memory when installed.  It is however significantly more difficult to remove, since the entire server must be dismantled (or Self-Destructed) before it can be uninstalled.  Since it does not allow you to make a run, it does not combo with any other Criminal tricks (i.e. Desperado, Bank Job), making it purely for sniping agendas placed behind a glacier.  Peek-A-Boo is probably quite self-explanatory, so I won't go into that save to mention that it slots quite nicely into any Blackguard deck.  Hacksaw is a very powerful AI breaker that has a high base strength of 3 and can raise it by 2 for just 3c.  It is perhaps the perfect complement to Criminal's existing central-only breakers and works very well with other Criminal tricks.  The only downside?  Its high MU cost."
Netrunner,39w7nm,RestarttGaming,2,Mon Jun 15 10:10:15 2015 UTC,"Three things -  One is you're only allowed to submit one card.  They didn't mention it this week, but it's a standing rule for these threads.  Two is remote servers don't have roots.  Only centrals have roots.  You just install everything the same in remotes, theres no separate area for only upgrades. (in the rulebook the root is a separate area present only for central servers.)  Thee is this line from the rules:  When installing a card in a server, the Corporation can first trash any cards already installed in that server.  So if they play a card into that server, like any asset or upgrade, they can also autotrash your program while leaving their cards still in there."

Netrunner,39ycex,exxTune,3,Mon Jun 15 21:27:53 2015 UTC,Check out the buying guide from the New Player's Guide in the sidebar. It's not 100% completed but it's got plenty to get you started.
Netrunner,39ycex,embaci,3,Mon Jun 15 20:12:55 2015 UTC,"If you can get opening moves, get opening moves.  It's a little hard to find right now though because it's awaiting a reprint - a lot of brick and mortar stores have it on the shelf, but many online retailers are out.  Beyond that, look at a faction or ID you like.  Find a card you would like to play with them, and see what pack it's from.  Or build a deck online (or look at the popular ones on netrunnerdb/stimhack that you like) and see , for that deck, is there one pack that has more than one of the cards needed to build it?  Basically very few packs are generally good or bad, but each pack is good for certain decks, and meh for others."
Netrunner,39ycex,RestarttGaming,2,Mon Jun 15 20:17:47 2015 UTC,"Opening Moves is very important, buy that as soon as you can.   One of my personal favorite packs is  Future Proof. It can also be rather difficult to find, but it contains great cards for almost all factions.   Runner: Mr Li, Faerie, R&D interface, Indexing   Corp: Eli 1.0, Ronin, Midseason Replacements, Project Beale"

I might purchase the previous cycles but just for friendlies/completing the collection. Hope this helps!"
