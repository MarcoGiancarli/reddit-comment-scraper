modelmakers,3e39kj,hemlock_jackal,4,Tue Jul 21 18:52:13 2015 UTC,"Nicely done, my advice for the future (no pun intended) is dipping the clear plastic parts in Future floor wax. It makes the parts look like actual glass rather than plastic. On that note, airbrushing the stuff on sort of fogs up the glass, maybe you can use that to your advantage somehow.   Apart from that there's not much you could improve on, really. It's practically spot on.   Also, how did you achieve that chrome look?"
modelmakers,3e39kj,BOB_9000,2,Tue Jul 21 18:54:02 2015 UTC,"Also, how did you achieve that chrome look?   Car models usually have a sprue of chromed parts- trim, bumpers, grilles, wheels, etc."

modelmakers,3e4rz5,MuhOthaDickIsBlack,2,Tue Jul 21 23:17:48 2015 UTC,"So I recently (as in last week) got back into modeling. I had done a few planes when I was a kid. ME 109, Spotfire, etc. I scored a couple of Tamiya 1/35 American and German figure kits, which are coming along nicely. Today, my older brother came over, and gave me these as an early birthday present. I am super stoked, obviously, much to my girlfriends dismay. I have never built a tank before, and I can only assume that the treads are the worst part. The Jagdpanzer IV is a Dragon kit, and the molds are super high detail. The treads are rubber, which I assume is a plus? The tiger isn't as detailed of a mold, but I am still very much looking forward to building it. I don't have an airbrush yet. I've got a bunch of Vallejo paints (brush on). Should I get an airbrush and appropriate paints for these? Also, any input on putting together the Tigers treads, link by link, without messing them up? Thanks!"
modelmakers,3e4rz5,HandBanaba,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:23:38 2015 UTC,"Typically speaking the individual link tracks are going to be more accurate than the rubber belt type. A lot of the rubber belt type also want you to use a hot screwdriver and melt them together but usually super glue works much better (Score the mating surface up with some rough grit sandpaper or just scrape it several times with your razor knife)  Airbrushes are really nice overall but not 100% necessary. You can just buy some rattle cans and get a pretty good effect and hand paint the rest if you wanna go on the cheap, but you can typically put out a much better quality model with an airbrush.   A lot of effects like hairspray chipping, color modulation, pre-shading, etc can only really be done with an air brush and appropriate paints. you can get similar effects using rattle cans and brushes but it's a lot more work and such.   The moldings are pretty typical for the two manufacturers. Dragon tends to have some crazy details in some kits but not the perfect assembly engineering where as Tamiya is basically advanced legos but some of their older moldings can be a little sparse on detail or have pretty inaccurate features(the ubiquitous $15 M41 Walker bulldog kit is a prime example since it has literally no under-hull details at all and the drivers view ports have no faces on them at all, etc.), etc for the subject. a lot of the newer Tamiya kits are simply fantastic however and some older dragon kits are of course not so great. Typically however Tamiya kits build super easily and dragon kits are a bit psyco in their detail and assembly."

Otherwise, I've had reasonable results, as long as you don't look too closely, with a fine-nibbed dye pen. A clear coat smudges it slightly to get the softer effect.   But yeah, there are somethings like Luftwaffe mottling that you can only really do properly with an airbrush."
modelmakers,3e30n9,SchnitzelOfDoom,2,Tue Jul 21 17:03:55 2015 UTC,Mask off the whole thing but put little bits of rolled up paper or tape between the mask and plane so that the mask is slightly elevated above the surface. Then lightly mist it a few times with rattlecan olive drab until you achieve the desired color. This is the el cheapo way I prefer.

modelmakers,3dyb1a,kwkfor,3,Mon Jul 20 17:14:49 2015 UTC,"I am indeed. That was part of the reason for the reorganization - I've got a lot of room for fighters still but for bombers I'll have to either move stuff or take it down. Luckily I don't have many big planes left to do - I think the only four engine planes I've got left are a Lancaster (will replace the old Matchbox Lancaster at top right) and an H8K Emily, which is a flying boat so it gets hung up with the PBM, Sunderland and He 115 under the shelves. Aside from that the light and medium bombers should be fairly easy to place. The Me 323 Gigant had fixed landing gear and will have about a 2 1/2-foot wingspan, so it's gonna find a home on a shelf or in a case somewhere. I tend to keep my best stuff near the bottom where people can easily view them, and older stuff gets moved near the top. When I'm completely out of space, older and lower quality models will start coming down and will probably be moved to a shelf in my game room, or back into storage. For instance, the Zero near the top in this picture is off color and even from this far back you can see the paint is just caked on. It's there for filler and will be one of the first to go. Once I can't justify taking any more down, well, I guess I'll have to start taking over a new wall. :)"

modelmakers,3dyb1a,Dungmaggot,3,Mon Jul 20 17:36:51 2015 UTC,"Some of these date back at least 15-17 years, though I've been at the hobby for around 24 or 25. The older kits represent the better of the kits I built in my youth, although probably around half of what you see (if not more) was built within the last three years. On this side the only planes older than three years are the upper B-24 ""Aries"", the Heinkel He 100 (tiny fighter on the far left side), the P-38, the B-26, the Skyraider and the Wellington. On the right side of the wall, everything above the He 111Z is old (with the exception of the Corsair), plus the Ki 84 Frank, Ki 61 Tony, and the He 162. The B-17 sitting on the shelf is ""Flak Eater"", an old brush-painted kit that was taken down to make room for the B-29. But yeah, most of this is from the past three years, including the helicopters (the Hind may be ~5 years, actually), the F-4 and A-4, and the seaplanes."

modelmakers,3dvrgd,MMGeoff,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:28:29 2015 UTC,I actually think it looks like a more elegant solution than the blue tack stuff (which I haven't really had good luck with).   The problem with the floating mask would be when you have to do that to get around complex curves.
modelmakers,3dvrgd,MMGeoff,4,Mon Jul 20 01:32:20 2015 UTC,"It's so you don't get a hard line of overspray onto the fuselage when you're painting things like tailplanes - at least I think that's what it's for.  Blue tack works really well for camo patterns as long as you make the rolls thick enough so that there's a bit of a stand-off distance between the blue tack and the model, at least that's what I've found.  EDIT: Nope, I'm completely wrong. You're right, it's to mask a soft edge for a camo pattern. Still, I hold that it's possible and very easy to get great results with Blue Tack or something similar. Paper masks seem awkward to me."
modelmakers,3dvrgd,wemblinger,2,Mon Jul 20 01:46:14 2015 UTC,To me it seemed to be an alternative to blue tack. The distance between the sheet and the surface was enough to create the soft edge in the same way that the diameter of the roll of blue tack is what creates the soft edge.

Or, use 'Tamiya' tape which is also called 'kubuki' tape and is sold by Bear as 'Painters Gold' tape. Even this has to have its stickiness reduced if possible, but less so.  Apply your tape and rub down just the edge. In fact, I apply thin strips of tape to define my edges, then fill this in with larger pieces.  Now, when you spray the model, aim away from the edge so the paint isn't driven into the 'corner' where the edge should be. It can be useful to try to spray at 90 degrees to the tape. Start with light coats that will dry quickly and help 'seal' the edge. Remove the tape as soon as you have the finish you want. Don't let the paint harden or it will flake off when you remove the tape.  You might still need to touch up a few spots.  In a place like a canopy where you can't aim 'away' from a corner, first apply black paint as your first sprayed colour. Then build up the colour you want over this. The black stops the light shining through and allows multiple very light coats that dry before they can soak under the tape.  With these methods, I can successfully use ordinary masking tape for camo, but I use good 'Tamiya' type tape for canopies and so on."
modelmakers,3dzw2g,MeneMeneTekelUpharsi,2,Mon Jul 20 23:18:03 2015 UTC,Make sure you have a good primer under the acrylic and that it has had plenty of time to dry/cure before you try to mask it.
modelmakers,3dzw2g,flounderflound,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:48:20 2015 UTC,"I work with model master paints and fight with this a lot when I use the acrylics. A good solid primer is a must (Model Master super fine white primer in a rattle can can do a great job), or if you don't want to prime, another option is to cut your masks out of paper, get it wet, and stick it to the plane. Then simply pull it off when you're done. The problem with that method though is that it can often be blown off by the airbrush. So the best method is priming."

Remember to pull the brush from the outside of the masked area toward the center, or some paint will slip under the tape.  Paint the frame of the canopy, it can make a big difference. You can use the masking tape trick to draw sharp lines. Your can always scrap the excess paint (once dried) with a toothpick.  a good clear varnish can help to seal the paint, and the decals.

modelmakers,3dvaey,alaskafish,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:53:17 2015 UTC,"Well, they still need to ship it there. It's not the states that get a mark up. Go to Poland, and you'll get European bands for cheap since the cost for exportation is cheap. Even better if you go to the country where it is manufactured and visit a station store (Mirage Hobby Poland or Roden Ukraine).   In the USA, there's an issue that modeling isn't popular as it is in Asia and Europe. Model stores are usually hobby shops/toy shops because you can't stay in business as a physical store just selling modeling supplies and whatnot. And there aren't many American brands. And at the end of the day, you have to rely on exports.  Now when I was just in China, I visited dragon's station shop, the extension shop for their factory. Now, I bought 1/72 vehicles and not 1/35, but they were all affordable. Now I remember reading that China makes models for even cheaper than they do in Europe. This is probably due to cheap labor. As a result they have more funding if you will to focus on nice moldings and sculpting. But also to sell them."

Just stick it on, remove it, stick it on again, about three, four times (depending on how sticky the tape is). That way the tape becomes less sticky: you can still use it for masking your model but you won't pull off the paint when you carefully remove it when you're done."

Alcohol dries up the paint before it come into contact with the surface you require painting. There's a reason Tamiya sells their proprietary acrylic and lacquer thinner for use with their paints.

modelmakers,3dvmyz,ionizzatore,2,Mon Jul 20 11:34:16 2015 UTC,"In my experience, a grainy finish from airbrushing paint means that the paint is drying before it hits the model.  When this happens, the paint obviously can not level out to a nice smooth finish.  You have to figure out WHY the paint is drying before it hits the model and address that.  10cm seems kind of far from the model to me, but I guess it depends on what you are trying to do and what you are painting."
modelmakers,3dv201,spencleb,4,Sun Jul 19 19:23:18 2015 UTC,"Is this a compressor with a tank, or without? If it's without then yeah, work for 10-15 minutes, then take a break, let things cool and dry, and then come back to it.  If it's got a tank, you should be fine to work continuously as long as it's just cycling the compressor and not running fill tilt. Oh yeah! Here is an even better idea!  Go to Harbor Freight!, buy any of these Fill it up inside, install a regulator and then spray until the air pressure gets low! They should sell all the fittings, etc."
modelmakers,3dv201,HandBanaba,3,Sun Jul 19 20:05:15 2015 UTC,"My following answers or suggestions are based off the assumption: that your compressor is a small one marketed for models.    Most small compressors come without an air tank. This causes several issues I'm sure your aware of. Such as water in the paint spray. Loud constant noise from running 100% during use. Hot airlines and components. Tons of vibration.  For a similar price range a pancake compressor has an air tank. Typically a larger compressor is made of heavier more durable components. They deal with heat better. With water traps have way less water spotting in the paint job. Because of the air tank the motor and compressor do not run 100% during use therefore making them overall less noisy, less hot, and with the right add on components gives more control over your air supply and painting.  If you can't get a larger compressor consider an add on air tank. They are about $50-90 at harbor freight. However this option is less desirable as you'd have to setup a custom motor shut off once your desired PSI/KPI are reached. Or manually shut off the compressor. This ability is included in larger compressor/tank devices. But this can extend your spray times and lead to an overall less hot and noisy operation.  Cooling the compressor you currently use. This can several things. Put it in the shade. Ambient or direct sunlight will add tremendously to how hot the compressor and motor get. Put a fan on it or point one at it. Helpful but not very if the outside temp where you work is already 90 degrees F already. I wouldn't put my compressor in a bag in a bucket of ice. This can easily lead to water ruining your compressor.    Maybe bend some copper tubing in a coil around the compressor and have the ends drop into a cooler full of water or antifreeze. Study water or cooling systems. Think miniature vehicle cooling system with a pump, a tank for the coolant, cooling cool/lines, and a radiator device. Pump sucks coolant from coolant tank, circulates through  copper coil over compressor gathering heat, goes into radiator to expel some of that heat, drains from radiator back into tank. Expensive? Maybe depending on your mechanical aptitude and how resourceful you are. But it's a lot of work just to cool a smaller compressor.    Worst idea: buy crappy mini fridge and put compressor inside. Won't work as the fridge will just get hot inside and stop cooling.  Just buy a bigger compressor with a tank. Best idea but most expensive. Harbor freight sells an oilless compressor with 3 gallon tank for around $50. Home Depot has an oilless compressor with 4-5 gallon tank for around $170.00. I won't lie the HD version is better constructed and might last longer. I've seen roofers use them all day in 120 degree F on hot roofs. They work ok in the heat. The Harbor Freight version not so sure.    Plan to buy mini valves, regulator, gauges (one for tank pressure and one for line pressure), and adapters to fit your mini air brush hose/line."
modelmakers,3dv201,Bounty66,0,Sun Jul 19 20:26:05 2015 UTC,"Well, you could fill a cooler with ice, then place a waterproof blanket over the ice and set the compressor on top.  Just make sure it doesn't get wet by letting the water in the cooler drip out freely."

The Tamiya Cheiftan and Bradley in 1:35 are reasonably cheap so I would like to pick those up - everything else these days seems to cost about $100NZ. I would like to get a T-55 or similar to complete the middle east theme but these are hard to come by - maybe I will pick up one of the Chinese variants and change to colour scheme.
modelmakers,3dtpha,Destructias_Warlord,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:29:37 2015 UTC,"I've been using the Tamiya Dual Action HG III Airbrush and it works great. It has a needle limiter if you're not so great with controlling the trigger. They have two models, the 0.33 mm nozzle and the 0.22 mm nozzle. They said the nozzle shape is matched with the needle taper for optimal performance. 0.22 for detail and 0.33 for a Jack of All trades airbrush.   I would also change the compressor if I were you. I'm saving on  a new one since the tamiya starter set compressor has limitations. (Loud ,can't airbrush while parents are asleep. No settable air pressure. Constant airflow.) But it is portable so that's a plus.  P.S. Good choice in kits! Try Trumpeter for sort of cheap 1/35 super detailed modern armor."
modelmakers,3dtpha,Anonieme_Angsthaas,3,Mon Jul 20 10:16:37 2015 UTC,"Welcome back to the hobby. You managed to pick up some nice kits! But the 1:76 Sherman and Panther probably aren't that good, as they are reboxes of their respective kits from the sixties. And the Fw 190 has some issues with the engine nacelle and MG hatch.  But the rest of your kits should be great! I picked the Mossie up yesterday, and I have built the Trop version of the Bf 109, and that is one of their best 1:72 I've seen to date :)  About that Tiger photo you put in, my best guess is that it's a pic taken by a member of a German Propagandakompanie, they would make pictures like this. Usually they were staged, because you don't want to be in front of a Tiger in a real battle. (because you should keep your Tiger pointed towards the enemy). Or it was a Russian with some balls of steel. pure Stalinium"
modelmakers,3dtpha,ionizzatore,3,Sun Jul 19 13:06:22 2015 UTC,"About that Tiger photo you put in, my best guess is that it's a pic taken by a member of a German Propagandakompanie   Correct, the photo was taken by ze Germans. Certainly not during a battle, even if it was not staged it was probably taken during a ""calm"" moment (every russian tank is destroyed/disabled)  Also, the tank on the right is not a T-34 but a BT7 (oval hatches)"

modelmakers,3duts5,cantrememberpasswo,4,Sun Jul 19 18:14:18 2015 UTC,"You're not using the right thinner. I don't know which one would be the right one, but the ones you've tried are definitely not right. Or the paint has gone bad from sitting too long."
modelmakers,3duts5,CaesarManson,2,Sun Jul 19 20:12:08 2015 UTC,^ This. I've fought with humbrol paint tooth and nail and finally had decent luck using Tamiya acrylic clear as suggested by /u/windupmonkeys and it worked pretty well. Still a last restor sort of paint.   The normal X20A thinner and mineral spirits basically melt the pigments and make them form little rubber like blobs that look like crap. Humbrols own acrylic thinner is pretty poor IMO as it still dry-tips like a motherfucker and the pigments are so irregular it's like they they used a dull butcher's knife to cut them up.   Thats not to say you can't get great results but the work involved is WAY too much when you can just but a $3 pot of Tamiya Red and be done with it.
modelmakers,3duts5,HandBanaba,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:23:45 2015 UTC,"Best idea would be to use Humbrol's acrylic thinner; it's made for the stuff and sprays well. Otherwise just use water. It's a water based paint unlike many others, so doesn't respond well to additives like ethanol."
modelmakers,3duts5,TheInfinityFish,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:24:24 2015 UTC,"I've still yet to try water actually. I'll give it a go. Also, would Isopropyl Alcohol work? I only got the ethanol as the IPA was annoyingly hard to find."
modelmakers,3duts5,ClimbingC,2,Sun Jul 19 20:48:31 2015 UTC,"Just try water.  I made the same mistake when I started out.  I assumed ""Acrylic Thinner"" would be the same regardless of brand, so got some Tamiya thinners for humbrol paints.  As you found out, it reacts and forms a plastic skin on the paint, and clogs things up.  There was a really good response to this question before, I can't find it, sorry.  But some guy was saying humbrol use a different chemical base to Tamiya, and the thinners are not interchangeable due to it.  I actually clogged up my airbrush solid due to this.  IPA is easy to get through Amazon, certainly here in the UK any way."

modelmakers,3duts5,HandBanaba,2,Sun Jul 19 21:59:32 2015 UTC,The Airfix paint is Humbrol acrylic paint. it also does not react well to Tamiya X20A thinner. That is 99% for sure your issue. (I've tried a LOT to get good results with humbrol acrylics and have nearly 40 pots of the stuff)  Vallejo Airbrush thinner is better for it but tamiya acrylic clear mixed 50/50 with the Humbrol paint works pretty well as a thinner. water works but the humbrol paint has such poor qualities its really not advisable.   Tamiya acrylic clear > Vallejo Airbrush thinner> Hombrol acrylic thinner is my suggestions in that order.

modelmakers,3dsui5,Nemephis,4,Sun Jul 19 11:06:20 2015 UTC,"I can't speak for B-24's specifically, but I have spent quite a lot of time studying some other era aircraft and here are some generalities.  First, the stencils (those are markings that are common to all aircraft) are generally applied at the factory.  Sometimes this could even be the national insignia. Apparently on the P-40, for instance, the plane was crated for shipment overseas and the national insignia were basically big decals that were not applied to the aircraft before it left the factory and were included in the crates with a quart of adhesive.  Other's might have had the national insignia painted on at the factory.  Other markings were definitely applied in the field.  On a recent P-47 build I did that had a huge wolf painted on the cowl, I found out that some squadrons had a dedicated artist who apparently did nothing but paint nose art and kill markings on aircraft. Other squadrons just had very intrepid crew chiefs who took care of that role.  Also note that invasion stripes painted prior to D-day were often painted on by the air crews in a field expedient manner, including using brooms as paint brushes.  We modelers tend to paint the invasion stripes as perfect alternating white and black stripes, or use decals, but actual photos show them of varying quality from pristine to sloppily applied.  I have also read that some aircraft (B-25 for instance) might have left the factory in a bare metal finish, to have the camo painted on in the field. Perhaps this wasn't done while they were forward deployed, but was definitely done after it left the factory, probably when it arrived in theater.  i don't know if any of that helps you. I tend to go to YouTube and look for documentaries about the aircraft. There are tons on there, and often they address these sorts of issues. Here is another good site that I have found useful with information about many different aircraft tailored towards modelers. http://www.cybermodeler.com/aircraft/b-24/b-24_all.shtml"

modelmakers,3dst0j,pellias,2,Sun Jul 19 02:53:25 2015 UTC,"What you said is semi correct. What you are describing is called a wash. A thinned down paint that is able to seep into crevices and hug extrusions.   However, you cannot paint the model acrylic and use an acrylic wash.   First things first, before an application of a wash, you must put on a gloss varnish, this is something you need. It helps the surface get smoother, and the wash flow. If not, the wash will just pool. It will also eat away the paint if you have no gloss varnish. Regardless if enamel wash or acrylicn wash. That... Well, kills your paint and strips it off the surface.  You cannot use acrylic wash Because their drying times is too quick for a wash. Even if you had an enamel varnish (the varnish is suppose to prevent stripping of paint, so it needs to be an opposite solvent) the acrylic wouldn't be able to flow and would pool, and dry. Then the wiping of the model would be very near impossible to remove excess. And it is important that you spray on the gloss and not paint it on. Painting it on doesn't make the surface smooth like it is suppose to...  Also, washing on an uneven surface is not a good idea, even if you work with enamel washes, and a gloss varnish. Considering you are brush painting and not airbrushing, the surface will be riddled with imperfections from the brush stibbles. As a result, the wash would flow unevenly through out the surface.  Now, I'm not saying it's impossible. But you're going to need to spend money on something if you like it or not. You can make an enamel wash if artist oils, and you can buy a cheap spray gloss varnish for under $5. And thinners for another five.    After you spray the varnish, and put on the wash, then you need to seal the entire model with a Matt coat. Make sure the canopy is removed or masked..."

modelmakers,3dst0j,alaskafish,1 point,Mon Jul 20 07:35:12 2015 UTC,It's good to seal it once again with a gloss varnish after you decal. It will protect them from getting hurt by lacquer washes.   The flat varnish is your final coat. It doesn't matter if you use a acrylic or enamel base.
modelmakers,3dst0j,vonshaunus,2,Mon Jul 20 15:16:20 2015 UTC,"I concur you should ideally use a spraycan gloss (or satin works okay I find) varnish (hobby store stuff is fine) over your brushpaint. It is cheap, easy to use and does the job. You can matt/satin the final finish with a brush or spraycan.  The only real viable alternative to a spray is klear floor polish, which you CAN apply with a brush with care not to put too much on, and it will settle to a smooth finish.  Once this is dry you can pretty much use anything for panel lines. AK interactive, Mig Ammo or Tamiya panel lines are very superior in my experience to just thinning washes though.  you can also apply weathering very effectively.  Never ever try to panel line on bare acrylics, that way tears of frustration lie!"

All (or most) of his airbrushes are connected to his compressor via a bunch of pipes, with the twist of a valve he can pick up another airbrush.     It's a bit overkill for most of us, it's just one of the many ""Why haven't I thought of that?!"" moments you get when watching his videos."
modelmakers,3dpplt,HandBanaba,3,Sat Jul 18 20:53:21 2015 UTC,I've messaged Paul several times and asked about a few different subjects. He's always been a great guy who's really nice and informative. His level of work and attention to detail is evident in everything he does. I mean just watching him spray primer on that Leo 2 so effortlessly and it looks like he's not even trying is frustrating for me because I have to stop every 5 seconds to clear Dry-tipping or clean the glob of primer off my shirt from where I just checked the time while holding my airbrush.. Wouldn't be so bad if I wore a watch.   I once called Iwata asking about  the HP-BE3 because I love the look and spray pattern of that airbrush and I wanted suggestions. They kept suggesting $500-600 spray guns to replace a ~$300 airbrush and just couldn't understand why anyone would want a reasonably priced airbrush with that spray pattern adjustment when you can buy a spray gun that is insanely overkill for the projects you normally work with. (Even the RG-3 though it's nice the smallest color cup is massive and after handling one I can't get my fingers to the bottom of the color cup to clean it properly. )  Guess I'll jus thave to settle for dreading putting down a primer coat. :-/

Pretty simple kits and you won't run into any fit problems as long as you don't rush things.  The only difficulty is the natural metal finish. To get that looking really good you have to have done a flawless assembly job.  Any kit in the Tamiya 1/72 Warbird range is excellent and pretty easy to build.

There is really nothing that I found (well besides the gun tubes) that I wish they had done differently.  I imagine the 1/72 kit is similarly strong."

Also, with the tyres (I think they're tires at least), they seem to be quite white on some rather than fully black. Is this intentional?  And also, the yellow's a bit orange.

If there's something I always recommend it's that you start off with acrylics, as they're more user friendly. Even now I still use them, and only use other mediums for very specific tasks. This is especially true for airbrushing.  Nice work overall, the build looks solid, the base coat (tan) was really nicely done, even if the green was a bit sloppy (and I mean a bit, it's really not all that bad).  It's got that museum tank look to it, which you don't see much among modelers. I personally really like it, great job!"
modelmakers,3dq7b0,plqamz,4,Sat Jul 18 11:16:07 2015 UTC,"Tamiya Surface Primer is Lacquer. You are probably confusing Tamiya Surface Primer with their Acrylic line of paints.  Water, Isopropyl alcohol, Acrylic thinner(X20A)... will not work on Tamiya Surface Primer and is a sure way to ruin a batch of it. You will end up with globs of goop. You can thin Tamiya's Acrylic Paints with Lacquer but it does not work the other way around and you cannot thin Lacquer paints with Acrylic thinning solutions.   For Tamiya Surface Primer, your options are off the shelf lacquer thinner, Tamiya's lacquer thinner, or Mr. Hobby Thinner (which is also lacquer). Off-the-shelf lacquer is the least forgiving as I find the solution reacts too fast when applied through an airbrush and TSP dries up before it comes into full contact with a kit and you end up with a lot of dusty primer particles. The Japanese lacquer thinners work better and flow smoother and level off the primer giving a more 'wet' layer to the kit for a more even coat. They are more expensive but you get what you pay for and have given me better finishes on my kits. The cheaper stuff in the long run ends up costing more in the sheer frustration of getting the mix right and often times having to re-do projects or entertaining the thought of having spent just a teeny bit more would have given me better results."
modelmakers,3dq7b0,holocause,1 point,Sat Jul 18 12:26:59 2015 UTC,Damn. I knew it was lacquer which is why I was confused at all the people saying to use isopropyl alcohol and the X-20 thinner for enamel. Looks like there's no way around having to order something online.

(Superglue to keep the tracks aligned, thread to keep the superglue from breaking.) This will be touchy and may not work well, but it's worth trying if you don't want to get into option 2.  2: Aftermarket tracks. Friulmodel or Spade Ace or Trumpeter. This will be a bit expensive (shop around! Check ebay!) and lots more work but it will look MUCH better than the rubber band tracks would have. Here's a comparison:  http://www.perthmilitarymodelling.com/reviews/vehicles/misc/panther_track/panther_track.htm  ...and there are probably other sets out there. Luckily Panthers are pretty popular tanks so there are lots of options.  If you want to avoid breaking tracks in the future, what I usually do is leave off the drive sprocket and idler, painting them separately, not gluing them on. When it's time to hook the tracks on, I loop them around the road wheels and then slide the drive sprocket up inside the loop of track and glue it on, and then do the same with the idler (which will be the easier to get in since you don't have to align it with the sprocket holes in the tracks). That minimizes track stretching and should keep them in one piece and keep paint from flaking off if you paint the tracks first...   (I've definitely busted tracks anyway, though. You are not alone in your struggle.)"

I've got that kit myself and really the only thing I can suggest is that you buy a set of Friuls, ATL-08 are what I put on mine. Bodging the stock tracks ain't gonna work, they're simply too short and you'll snap the drive sprockets right off trying that.  Speaking of, you'll also need aftermarket drive sprockets. Friulmodel also makes these but they can be a bitch to find.

In working with very small pieces I have two questions.   Is it necessary to prime them?  I am using an airbrush and have tested on some extra pieces I have lying around.  For the small pieces it seems like I can get away without using primer.  Will this come back to haunt me? What is the best way to handle them?

I'm guessing you're mostly looking at cockpit pieces which are generally grouped together on part trees. I just cut the entire section free from the tree and use the frame sprue as a built-in hold/clip point. Really small parts get usually fully painted on the tree.  Alligator clips may also be an option. Sometimes I line the mouth of clips and vices with a bit of folded painter's tape to give the part a little more protection, especially if it's small and delicate or already painted."

modelmakers,3dmq66,MadMorf,3,Fri Jul 17 18:32:47 2015 UTC,"Any sample pix?  Usually, brush painting problems come from using un-thinned paint and trying to get everything done in one coat. The best way to do it is to thin the paint to the consistency of skim milk and apply the paint thinly, covering everything in 3 coats.   Also, lay paint down in one stroke and don't go back over the stroke. Let it dry completely before going over it with the second and then 3rd thin coats."
modelmakers,3dmq66,BigD1970,2,Fri Jul 17 18:40:24 2015 UTC,"Ah. Unthinned paint. That's probably it.   What's the best way to thin paint to the right consistency, please?  (Re: Sample pics - if you don't mind me linking to a blog, there's some here:http://bigdassorted.blogspot.co.uk/2014/12/confessions-of-terrible-modelmaker-pt-3.html)"
modelmakers,3dmq66,MadMorf,3,Fri Jul 17 18:43:41 2015 UTC,"Well, you mix thinner with paint until it seems the same consistency as skim milk. Start of with maybe a 50/50 mix. Not sure what paint you're using, but that consistency will allow the paint to just flow off of the brush.   Also, from looking at your pix, it appears you're either dabbing the paint on, or going back over the wet paint. Try not to do either of those. Lay the paint down in single strokes, as long as you can make them, and then don't touch them again until they're completely dry.  And, it's tough to make camouflage look good when it's brush painted. That's just the nature of the beast. Airbrushed will always look better."
modelmakers,3dmq66,BigD1970,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:53:58 2015 UTC,Thank you very much. I'll try that on my next kit.
modelmakers,3dmq66,solipsistnation,2,Fri Jul 17 18:54:53 2015 UTC,Strips of masking tape along the edges of what should be straight lines will help too.
modelmakers,3dmq66,BigD1970,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:32:39 2015 UTC,Thank you.   Is there any particular sort of masking tape I should be using? I keep finding that the paint has bled through the tape.
modelmakers,3dmq66,solipsistnation,3,Fri Jul 17 20:34:28 2015 UTC,"Tamiya's tape or the kind of blue painter's tape that says something like ""Delicate Surfaces."" Burnish the edge down well and be careful about laying down too much paint right along the edge-- tape works a little better with airbrushing, and it'll always fail if you put enough paint down that you get little pools, or more than a thin rapidly-drying layer."
modelmakers,3dmq66,BigD1970,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:03:44 2015 UTC,Many thanks.
modelmakers,3dktid,MeneMeneTekelUpharsi,7,Fri Jul 17 02:06:38 2015 UTC,"If the gap is relatively small, you can use testors clear parts cement and window maker. I use it to fill gaps like that on occasion."
modelmakers,3dktid,Fortunate_0ne,4,Fri Jul 17 03:17:43 2015 UTC,"Wow that actually worked, thanks. I had to put a little bit of putty on the very front corner, but the clear parts cement settled nicely into the gaps. Lucky I had a bottle lying around, it's pretty much worthless for actually sticking things together."
modelmakers,3dktid,REWK,4,Fri Jul 17 04:03:27 2015 UTC,Pic?
modelmakers,3dktid,FoxhoundBat,5,Fri Jul 17 15:46:34 2015 UTC,"I use one of the two methods;  1; White wood glue. Apply and then it is easy to remove with q-tip, preferably dipped in lukewarm water.  2; Apply tamiya putty and then use acetone + q-tip to remove access putty. Pretty common technique for seams in general but also works for clear parts. Just remove the access putty fairly quick, within ~5-10 min.  Keep in mind that especially wood glue shrinks so it is best to fill in the gaps fairly early (ie not right before the paint) and give it to sink in for a week or so, then do another round."
modelmakers,3dktid,Uncle_Humpy,3,Fri Jul 17 12:40:56 2015 UTC,"I recently got back into modelling after abruptly stopping 6 months ago, and this Hunter is a kit I boxed up ~60% done, and I'm trying to salvage it. I had put together the fuselage and wings all that time ago, albeit with some poor technique and now the kit has some fit problems. Even something as simple as the front windscreen, shown here, doesn't quite want to sit right.  Is it worth it using putty to fill those gaps, or should I just leave it be? The other side is ok for the most part. If I should fill it, how do I go about it without messing up the masking and keeping it looking reasonably similar to the side that doesn't need the filler?  thanks"
modelmakers,3dktid,hal0eight,4,Fri Jul 17 02:09:35 2015 UTC,Fill it because you can't un-notice this kind of gap now that you've seen it. For gaps like this I mask close against the crack with some Tamiya tape and then scrape putty into the gap. Let it dry then carefully sand (sanding sponges are awesome for this because the conform to the curves and give you a nice smooth result). Paint and it should be invisible.
modelmakers,3dktid,SnarkMasterRay,2,Fri Jul 17 06:19:05 2015 UTC,I'd fill that with some wood glue. Might need 2 applications.
modelmakers,3dktid,ionizzatore,2,Fri Jul 17 12:40:41 2015 UTC,"Another option if you have larger gaps would be an epoxy putty such as Apoxie Sculpt or Milliput. They're two-part epoxies that you mix (really easy, two clays, cut equal portions and mash them together for a minute in a cathartic frenzy) and apply. They can be smoothed with water and finger tips or Q-tips (spatulas work as well) before it sets so there's no need to get anywhere near the clear with a sanding stick or paper. Dries hard with no shrinkage. I recently picked up my first tube of Perfect Plastic Putty, which is also cleanable and shape-able with water, but I haven't had a chance yet to see if it affects clear plastic."
modelmakers,3dktid,SnarkMasterRay,1 point,Sat Jul 18 06:35:46 2015 UTC,"Epoxy putty dries hard as a rock, sanding it down will be a pain if OP does not smooth the surface correctly while it's still soft (specially near a clear part, the risk of scratching it is high)"
modelmakers,3dktid,ionizzatore,1 point,Sun Jul 19 15:23:24 2015 UTC,"Perhaps, but I've never had luck with clear parts cement filling a void flawlessly either - it's always a bit shrunk."
modelmakers,3di5x5,flounderflound,11,Thu Jul 16 13:47:43 2015 UTC,That came out pretty well! What a weird plane.
modelmakers,3di5x5,solipsistnation,8,Thu Jul 16 14:46:24 2015 UTC,"Thanks! Yeah, it's definitely a weird one. But then of course that's one of the reasons I had to build it."
modelmakers,3di5x5,Foodstamp001,3,Thu Jul 16 14:50:32 2015 UTC,"Indeed, I have doubts about the practicality of the inward facing fuselage guns."

modelmakers,3di5x5,Spike52656,2,Thu Jul 16 17:53:25 2015 UTC,"I almost didn't put them in for that very reason. I couldn't find any historical photos that proved they had the inboard guns. That said, the Z-2 variant was never built anyway, so there's a little bit of room for speculation and builder's preference. My real frustration was that they didn't include the bombsights."

Sorry for the big album - I tried to keep it to a picture a day, which still got pretty big, then add the massive number of pictures I took when finished and, well, it got a little out of hand. Nonetheless, enjoy.  There were some people who were asking questions and got ambiguous answers. /u/Fortunate_0ne, /u/BOB_9000, /u/Spike52656, /u/Aiglos_and_Narsil, here are your answers."

modelmakers,3di5x5,BOB_9000,3,Thu Jul 16 16:20:27 2015 UTC,"Sorry to hear about the carpet monster getting at your interior PE. I'm more impressed at the time it took you to construct than anything else. Working with the PE must've been incredibly frustrating ha.  I may have missed it, but did you use chipping fluid for the paint?  The field patch idea for the window worked out really well! My favorite shot is this one because it really shows how massive it is."
modelmakers,3di5x5,BOB_9000,3,Thu Jul 16 17:44:22 2015 UTC,"Thanks! As for the chipping, I actually did this without chipping fluid, hairspray or salt. I buy as much as I can at my local hobby shop (they're a fantastic small business in dire need of support), but the only way they carry the RLM colors is in Model Master acrylic, which comes off really easily if it's not directly on a primer (and even then sometimes).  Basically I primed it, applied an enamel steel coat, then painted it. When I pulled the masking off it took some paint with it (most of which I repaired by brush), but as far as the scuffs and scratches on the wing and engine leading edges go, I aggressively took a pair of tweezers and chipped it. For some of the longer scratches and the propeller leading edges these same tweezers have a rough edge, almost like a file for better gripping. I opened them wide and used this surface as an abrasive. They're a large and pointy pair of 45-degree tweezers - you can probably spot them in the background of a few images there.  So yeah, long story short, I didn't use anything, just chipped it manually, on purpose and by accident."
modelmakers,3di5x5,BOB_9000,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:53:47 2015 UTC,"Very clever, nice work"
modelmakers,3di5x5,BOB_9000,2,Thu Jul 16 18:09:38 2015 UTC,"I just noticed your field patch comment (don't know how I missed it the first time). Thanks - I tried to make due the best I could. What's really frustrating is that the piece that fell in is now loose again and rattling around, so it'll always be there to remind me every time I pick this damn thing up. I tried to make the repair as subtle as possible so not to look too obvious, but at the same time didn't want to just paint around a center hole and try to mimic the PE parts either, because that would just look silly."
modelmakers,3di5x5,Plundersquirrel,7,Thu Jul 16 19:20:45 2015 UTC,"It happened! It finally happened!  I was expecting good results but this is surpasses those expectations with ease, really amazing work! I was skeptical as to how much a detailed interior would add, considering you can't see much of it, but the difference is immense, good call on getting that.   It's just a shame you won't be seeing much of the ventral side once it's up on display. It's a shame we can't mail it around so we can all get a real look at the thing.  If there's one thing I'm not too keen on -and it's a rather minor thing at that- is the guns should be black, I think. Also, through no fault of your own, but rather shoddy mold quality, they aren't up to class when compared with the rest of the aircraft, which is practically top notch.  Really amazing work overall though, probably the best 111z I've ever seen. Granted, it's the only one I've ever seen but my point still stands.  EDIT: Did I mention I love the weathering? Because I love the weathering."
modelmakers,3di5x5,garethashenden,3,Thu Jul 16 16:08:49 2015 UTC,"Thanks!   I was skeptical as to how much a detailed interior would add   Normally I wouldn't invest in all that knowing nobody would ever see it again, but with these big glazed noses I definitely agree - it paid off big time.   It's just a shame you won't be seeing much of the ventral side once it's up on display.   That bums me out too, but when I have somebody over and show them I'm usually not shy about pulling stuff down. Since I hang them via picture wire on a nail in the wall, it's as easy as unhooking the loop.   is the guns should be black   This nags at me too. I think I'm going to dry brush some gunmetal paint over them and see if I can darken them up. I followed the instructions on this one (they said to paint the guns ""steel""), so I used my steel paint color and I always feel like it's too bright. I went rogue and painted the exhaust pipes with ""jet exhaust"" (Model Master) then stained them with soot from a Tamiya weathering kit because I DO WHAT I WANT. But yeah, the guns don't quite look right to me either.  This isn't the first time I've run across this - is there anybody who can explain why so many model companies call for steel on guns?"
modelmakers,3di5x5,Fortunate_0ne,4,Thu Jul 16 16:19:45 2015 UTC,"Darker shades of steel tend to be somewhat similar to gunmetal,  or rather, very similar. I assume this that's what they refer to. I'm pretty sure tamiya's steel is quite dark too, so I'd assume it's a standard for modeling companies.   Is there really any difference between jet exhaust and, uh, the stuff that you're supposed to use? Ultimately it's black residue either way."
modelmakers,3di5x5,MadMorf,3,Thu Jul 16 17:01:15 2015 UTC,"Model Master's ""Jet Exhaust"" is basically a steel-ish metal with a brownish/bronze look to it. The B-17 I did earlier this year shows the color pretty well."
modelmakers,3di5x5,openletter8,5,Thu Jul 16 17:10:10 2015 UTC,"I presume for heavy weathering black would work just fine. It's nice to have the option to be subtle though, I'll look into that."
modelmakers,3di5x5,solipsistnation,3,Thu Jul 16 17:53:34 2015 UTC,"Did I mention I love the weathering? Because I love the weathering.   Thanks - weathering is something I'm only just starting to venture into. I was able to put the fragile nature of the Testors/Model Master acrylics to some use without using the hairspray or salt techniques in this particular case. Tracing the panel lines was time-consuming but I'm glad I did it, and the Tamiya weathering kits I wasn't sure were going to do much for me turned out to definitely be a worthwhile purchase. Weathering scares the hell out of me, though. I'm afraid I'll mess something up and permanently screw up the model trying to fix it. And with how much time I had in this one, that was a very scary thought."
modelmakers,3di5x5,openletter8,4,Thu Jul 16 16:41:01 2015 UTC,"Ground vehicles tend to be rather forgiving when it comes to weathering, so that's not a bad place to get some practice.  That being said, it went really well for you here. That cock up with the masking tape helped quite a bit too, luckily."
modelmakers,3di5x5,HerbertMcCheese-Wang,3,Thu Jul 16 17:03:58 2015 UTC,"I plan to buy a half track to go with my Me 323, so I may get some good practice there. As for the masking tape, yeah - I patched up what I knew I couldn't get away with (thanks to /u/solipsistnation for helping me decide not to keep all of the missing paint, I'm glad I fixed some of it) and fixed what was obvious but took advantage of the screwup a little bit."
modelmakers,3di5x5,vonshaunus,2,Thu Jul 16 17:13:06 2015 UTC,If the thing's about to be transported I'd presume it'd be rather clean. You could probably make it work just as well with a trip the other way around.

modelmakers,3dj35m,FreakinfreakInfreaki,2,Fri Jul 17 17:23:23 2015 UTC,Airbrushing isn't that bad. It's mostly in the paint you use and if you can get primers to work.

modelmakers,3djmcs,Plundersquirrel,3,Thu Jul 16 20:18:39 2015 UTC,"A lot of these I can't honestly be a lot of help with, because I'm not terribly experienced with weathering. On the matter of the exhaust burns and the oil cooler/carburetor ducts, I do have a few suggestions.  I would say the best way to do these is with an airbrush. I mixed ""Jet Exhaust"" with ""Armor Sand"" for the effect I got on my B-17 I did a few months back. I would suggest not going too crazy with the burns on top of the wings, but the ones from the actual exhausts below the wings could easily have some flat black mixed in, especially on a painted plane as opposed to my baremetal one, because it would scorch the paint more directly. The cooling ducts on top got hot sometimes, but it was air blowing through picking up heat off the engine as opposed to the higher heat of the exhaust. Basically on the cooler ducts a little oil slick might be acceptable and just a slight darkening but nothing too extreme.  Dry brushing might work but I tend to put a little more faith in airbrushing. Also, if you put a note card across the beginnings of the vents when you airbrush them you can have a clean line where they open.  As far as the panel lines go, my last two builds I've taken a shot at using a mechanical pencil (the ones that click the lead down) and tracing the lines. My He 111Z I just finished is on the main page right now and I did a pair of Whirlwinds very recently using this method. I love it now."
modelmakers,3djmcs,flounderflound,2,Thu Jul 16 20:43:59 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the quick reply. Your B-17 was one of the ones I looked at for reference.   So, with the airbrushing: would you spray a very small amount out at a time? My airbrush tends to struggle with that, and doesn't have a very accurate spray. I'll just have to get close. I didn't realise the actual exhausts were on the underside. And should I spray the burns and oil before the gloss, after the gloss, or after the flat at the end? And which bit are the cooler ducts? Sorry, I'm not anywhere near as knowledgable as some on this sub about aircraft.  I'll definitely use a piece of card or masking tape for a clean line.  That's a cool trick with the pencil, I'll have to try that.  Thanks!"
modelmakers,3djmcs,flounderflound,3,Thu Jul 16 20:56:15 2015 UTC,"No problem!  I would recommend airbrushing at high pressure with low flow. My airbrush is pretty basic - a Badger 350, so nothing special. Thin the paint you're using to make it thinner than you normally would, but not a lot - if you thin it too much you'll get water splatters instead of it sticking. On the He 111 I did it after the glosscoat - this will allow for a smoother application. Same with the pencil - do it after the glosscoat. If you do it while the paint is still flat you'll get a rougher application.  The cooler ducts vent on top of the wing. All that typically passed through them was air so keep that in mind - unless anything leaked all they would have done would have been to maybe brown the wing a little. Here's an album of close-ups I took of Aluminum Overcast. These helped me quite a bit. This plane's kept pretty much pristine so it won't help much for weathering but it'll do you some good.  As for the pencil trick, I love it. I'm not good with pin washing or filters, given I'm 80% colorblind. Using a mechanical pencil allows me to bring out the panel lines and in the process the plane will dirty up a little on its own. From there I use a Tamiya weathering kit and apply soot and whatnot, then dullcoat over everything.  If you run across any questions along the way, feel free to ask me, too. I've done 3 B-17s in my day and absolutely love them, and I'll be happy to help if I'm able."
modelmakers,3djmcs,flounderflound,2,Thu Jul 16 21:08:03 2015 UTC,"Thanks a lot for the great answers. That album's really handy, thanks. 80% colourblind! That makes the models you pull off even more impressive!  Thanks, I'd be glad of someone to ask. I'll send you a PM if I have any questions."

modelmakers,3djmcs,screamingcheese,3,Thu Jul 16 21:18:41 2015 UTC,"Oh, just had another thought. Do similar light scorching behind the cowl flaps (the opening directly behind the front cowling) similar to that of the cooler vents. Same reason.

Here's what I did:  Around the engines, starting with bare plastic, I painted streaks of flat black paint (specifically, around the exhausts, turbos and vents).  Model Master enamels, painted olive drab top surfaces, neutral grey bottom, thick enough to coat well but still be discolored from the dark spots sprayed earlier.  After each color was sprayed down, I added just a couple of drops of Floquil 'antique white' (out of production sadly), and a TON of thinner.  Then, slowly, lightly and carefully, I added fading into the middle of the panels.  Once that was done, I came back through with REALLY thin dark grey paint and added some more sooty, gross areas around the exhaust vents on the wings.    Since I did 'Lil Patches,' named so because she was repaired so often, I then masked off some panels and sprayed them with fresh olive drab.  The effect is subtle, but powerful.  Then came clearcoat, decals, clearcoat again, panel line wash with watercolors mixed to be a darker shade of the base color, then a dull coat.    Going forward, I'll use chalk pastels to add a wee bit more soot and exhaust staining.    Edit: I should note, I did this all with an airbrush.  If you don't have one, here's a neat and handy trick.  Go get yourself a big box of chalk pastels from an art supply store.  Yes, even with all the colors.  Then, get yourself chisel style paintbrushes - flat, short bristles, perhaps of differing widths. Before you start, hit the model with dull-coat to give something for the pastels to settle onto, and let it dry completely.    Scrape the pastel sticks lightly with a knife, then take that brush, poke it in the powder, then GENTLY pull it across the surface of the model, starting at the exhaust/panel line/etc, going with the flow of the air on the aircraft for exhaust staining.  Don't be afraid of using weird colors.  Fade panels with greens, greys, etc.  Darken panel lines.  If you get too much, you MIGHT be able to wash them off with a damp cloth.  Once completed, hit it with a little dull-coat again to seal it if you so wish.  It's not necessary, but will hold up better under handling.  You'll notice the effect softens and gets less noticeable when you apply dull-coat to it."

modelmakers,3ddljo,Medjoe,3,Wed Jul 15 15:50:35 2015 UTC,"Looks great, and the rigging adds so much more detail to a biplane, err... triplane! So I must ask (I have a P26 on hold because of the rigging, and it's somewhat discouraging), how did you go about it? CA glue I assume? Was there any accelerator involved? Otherwise how long did it take for the wire to remain glued in the respective hole?"
modelmakers,3ddljo,llordlloyd,3,Wed Jul 15 15:06:50 2015 UTC,"The ""wire"" was Fine EZ Line, secured with standard thickness CA.  I drilled tiny holes, intended to be filled with CA and then having the EZ Line anchored into them on each end. To be honest, things got a little sloppy this time and next time I'll try to make the holes even smaller.  After filling the hole with CA, I inserted one end of the EZ Line and held it still for about 30 seconds.  On 1/72 you almost have to do it this way, because of the small size. On larger scale models, it could be easier and more appropriate to use monofiliment thread,brass tubing and tiny screw eyes, to more accurately represent the actual mounting structure."
modelmakers,3ddljo,llordlloyd,2,Wed Jul 15 15:57:19 2015 UTC,"Ah, I see. I am using the same method, with fine black EZ line, but the issue I ran into is that the CA glue doesn't stick after 30s-1min, and it's kinda fiddly holding the wire exactly into place for that long (maybe I'm not patient enough), because it seemed like every tiny movement meant that I had to wait the same duration again. And when that doesn't work, EZ line curls up at the end and gets even more frustrating. I even tried putting a speck of white glue in the hole but the result was inconclusive. So far I only managed by miracle to glue 2 of the 8 wires in place. Guess I'll have to give it a second try with a bit more patience."
modelmakers,3ddljo,Medjoe,3,Wed Jul 15 22:52:01 2015 UTC,"Here's what I did on my Vickers Vildebeest. Drill holes in the upper wing that don't go all the way through. Cut pieces of EZ line (I used nylon 'invisible mending thread') a bit too long for each wire, and roughen the end and part where they will be glued.  This helps the glue grip.  Glue the line into the top wing, which should be painted and more or less finished. Drill holes all the way through the lower wing, fuselage, undercarriage struts etc. Glue the wings together. Jig the model up so you have good access underneath the model.  Now, pass the 'wire' through the lower wing, allow it to flop. Use an approved device (toothpick, loop of wire, applicator) to put a small drop of glue on the line where it will pass through the lower wing (since your line is loose, this should be just above the wing). Pull the line taught from underneath, you can clamp on a clothes peg or crocodile clip to weight it. Wait patiently, or put a brush of CA Accellerator near the attachment point.  Once all this is done, you have to clip off the excess line, fill the holes with superglue, and sand and re-finish the lower wing.  The only real tricks are to be patient, and to jig the model up in a good position so you can do the rigging without having to handle the model. A low-speed hair dryer can also dry superglue quickly, I keep one close by when modelmaking fore this purpose. Superglue is a pain in the backside, a necessary evil. It never dries when you need it to, but dries immediately when that will cause disaster."
modelmakers,3ddljo,Medjoe,1 point,Thu Jul 16 12:16:44 2015 UTC,"One of the guys in my local IPMS club uses ""invisible mending thread"" and recommended this same technique, with the added bit of using a hair dryer, set on low heat, to cause the monofiliment to tighten up after the lines are in place and the glue is set.

modelmakers,3ddljo,flounderflound,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:40:02 2015 UTC,"Interesting points.I hadn't considered using glue for the wing holes, will have to try it. At the very least, half the thing should stay correctly after that, and I'm assuming there's less tension on the wire at the end point, so it's not forced as much out of the hole. I'm unsure what you mean by roughing up the edge of the wire though, as EZ line is already very thin...  This being my first rigging attempt, I may have started in a poor order, since I'm trying to put the rigging before any painting, and planning to use a very fine brush around the tricky spots. The reason for this is that The fuselage halves already had the 4 holes done (with engine+cowling attaching later), so I was able to glue a length of wire inside for more surface area, and that worked out okayish. I'll consider doing the rigging after painting, but I'll have to get a new CA glue and some accelerator and run some tests on a sprue before making the decision.  The last part made me chuckle, it sums up perfectly the behaviour of glue :)"

I just mixed it in equal parts, wasn't that accurate and then mixed it with my paint color.  Took about 30 min to start getting set and about 5 hours to get really solid.  Granted a puddle may only take a couple hours.  Now, you mentioned boot splashes.  Take a look at the PBR's bow.  There is a wave coming off of it.  I cut a plastic bottle into that shape and glued it on.  Then I thickened some resin with corn starch or baking soda.  Then I slopped it on the wave in a couple layers, allowing it to dry between slops.  I think you could do this with your boot splashes on a smaller scale.  Experiment with it first of course.  If you want waves or ripples, I let the puddle dry and then add my thicker mix on top of that and shape it into waves.  As it stiffens you can make sharper peaks.  For softer peaks, shape earlier on.  This stuff is amazingly self leveling.  You may need to make adjustments hours after its poured.  I am obviously not a master at these techniques, but the idea is sound and would look great with practice."

The airbrush is alright. It's enough to learn on, develop a paint/cleaning routine, and realize what you're looking for in an airbrush. I don't say this as part of a ""Just a buy an Iwata/Badger/etc."" notion because while a lot of people will tell you that you get what you pay for in the realm of airbrushes dropping $150-200 on just a brush is not an inviting entry point. You certainly do pay for quality when it comes to airbrushes, so you'll probably find its quirks and limitations in a timely fashion, but if you're just starting out you're not going to be pumping out Luftwaffe mottle camo ASAP no matter what you're using.   I don't have any complaints about the compressor thus far. Take heed from the Amazon reviews and make good use of the teflon tape. The only thing that I've noticed is it seems to leave something to be desired in the way of performance on lower PSI. However, I'd still fiddling around to see if this is more user error.

modelmakers,3dfcji,ionizzatore,3,Thu Jul 16 04:20:51 2015 UTC,"Maybe you're making the same mistake I am, and you've started out with enamels. Acrylics tend to be much more user friendly. Really what it comes down to is how much you thin it. Try to get the consistency of milk when thinning (water works fine), or as I prefer it, a little thicker.  If it starts spitting paint, you'll need to clean the thing out thoroughly, especially the nozzle and needle.   If it's spitting water, your compressor's got a build up of condensation that's going through the air pipe. The only fix I've found was to take a break, and when coming back, spraying air for a bit to get the water out of the air hose.   You'll cock up a lot at the beginning, we all did, but keep at it and experimenting with the thing, acrylics are easy to sort out, even if they dry up in your airbrush and whatnot (remember, alcohol can dissolve dry acrylic)  Hope it helps, even a little :)"

modelmakers,3dfcji,Tadg_Strudwick,3,Thu Jul 16 01:22:12 2015 UTC,"Personally, I don't use modeler's paints, like humbrol and whatnot. I just work with standard artist's stuff. Not tubes, the kind that come in cylindrical containers that you squeeze out. As far as that goes, I think I've struck gold with FolkArt, their paint is really, really nice for airbrushing. The other company I use (really just because they have an abundance of shades) is Craft Smart, they're really hit and miss, some paints are fine, no problem with airbrushing, while others are awful things designed in hell.   Granted, if you ask some other modelers, they'd likely recommend a modeling specific paint. My suggestion, try them both, see what floats your boat. modeling paint does cost a bit more though."

modelmakers,3db3r2,Sotonian,2,Tue Jul 14 23:59:19 2015 UTC,"Pro tip: regular Rex and Black Edition Rex are the same kit, the only difference is that the black edition is molded in black and brown. Since you'll have to paint the model in order to apply the camo and the yellow stripe (paint scheme is available online, feel free to ask if you need it), buy the cheapest one (the ""classic"" version is out of production, the price skyrocketed).   Kotobukiya also makes the Ray (same scale)   Shaghod is not produced by anyone in kit form, but a limited edition of mgs3 contained a papercraft Shaghod + Rex, I'm sure that you can find the scan online"

Well, as i said you have to repaint it anyway, so the cheapest one is the best option  The ThreeA version is insanely beautiful, insanely big and insanely expensive   I looked at the paint scheme in the manual and the color mixing gets pretty complicated. The Green Camo color for instance requires three paints mixed at 87%, 9% and 4%. I don't even know how to measure that out correctly.   Since you will need ""large"" quantities of paint you can pre-mix the paint in a jar. Usually paint ratios are ""easier"" (50/50, 20/80, ...), in this case i'd suggest to take a syringe and measure the milliliters of paint in order to achieve a perfect mix (87% -> 8.7ml, 9% -> 0.9ml and so on)  Or you can just head to you LHS and buy the paint that matches the ""proposed"" color.  Or you can simply mix the colors following the suggested ratio without worring too much if you used an 87-9-4 or an 85-10-5 ratio. After all this is your reference, i doubt that any rivet counter will ever argue about the paint being too greenish, too grayish and so on.

modelmakers,3dbap0,Hubzee,2,Wed Jul 15 11:55:42 2015 UTC,"Did you apply fairly heavily to the whole model or just the detailed areas or even just used small amounts? (sorry for all the questions, it's just I'm a rookie modeller and this tank is my next project, plus I really like how this looks)"
modelmakers,3dbap0,alaskafish,1 point,Wed Jul 15 12:02:52 2015 UTC,"Just to the detail areas.  Sort of a heavy pin wash.  A pin wash, if you dont know, is when you apply the wash just to areas where you want it instead of coating the whole surface.  For example, I brushed it along all the lines of bolt heads and anywhere there was raised detail, but I didnt brush along smooth surfaces.  I applied enough to bring out the detail but tried to avoid using too much.  This wash is a very dark brown and the smoothing will darken the model overall, which I want, but its possible to make it too dark if you aren't careful.  When I smoothed it out, those smooth surfaces got a thin layer but it stayed mostly on the raised detail areas.  At least, thats the idea.  No need to apologize for asking questions, thats how you learn, and I'm happy to answer."

Sometimes I see is like a dark grey, but other times it's light grey like this.  I'm not sure why this happens, because when I buy 'panzer grey' I get the dark color. Yet some peoples models come out like this, and other sources (ala pictures and some games).   Is there something historical? Like very early German tanks were lighter? Or is it like the Russian tanks how sometimes they were dark green or almost a tan?"
modelmakers,3dbap0,MuhOthaDickIsBlack,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:50:07 2015 UTC,"In real life, the color Germany used was a very dark, almost black, grey.  RAL 7021 was the official designation.  Pant faded in the sun over time though, and vehicles in service often accumulated layers of dust that lightened them considerably, especially during the dry summer months.  Different brands of hobby paint will be different shades.  The basecoat I used here is the Tamiya TS-4 rattlecan, German Grey.  You can see the can in the second photo.  Tamiya's paint is noticeably too light, but it can be darkened up a bit with washes (which I've done) and a small model often looks better if it is painted a bit lighter than the actual color due to scale effect.    I used the rattlecan mostly because I don't own an airbrush.  Vallejo's german grey is darker than Tamiya's and at some point in the future when I do have an airbrush, I'll use that on my early German stuff instead.  I certainly can't claim that my finish is the most realistic possible, but it works for me.  Hope that helps answer your questions."

I decided to just try and cope with the large chunk taken out.

It then would chip decently but it was super insanely fragile, like a single drop of water would make large portions release. Luckily I could just take a large flat brush and smooth it out and it would re-adhere as soon as the water dried.   Final-ish result.

modelmakers,3d9f2e,solipsistnation,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:58:45 2015 UTC,"Yes. It's pretty great.   You can scrape them with the back of a knife or sand them onto a palette, then use a brush dipped in paint thinner to pick them up and squoosh them around. After it dries and they're kind of clumpy on there you can take a stiffish brush and brush it off again and get a pretty nice effect. If you brush off a little you get caked mud or dirt, and if you brush off a lot you get a nice dusty effect.   I like to really work dark brown and reddish chalk into metal tracks to get them nice and dirty, then brush them off a little and sand lightly along the side that contacts the ground to get some bare metal showing. You can see that here:  http://i.imgur.com/mTAMgKg.jpg  I've been using a box of cheap chalk pastels I picked up for under $10.00 that has lasted me through a bunch of models."

I picked up Academy's F4F-4 in 1/72. At $4-7 a pop they're easy on the wallet and make a real easy build to practice skills and painting on. Well, my research got the better of me and I thought I could tackle some light modifications to fit a True Details cockpit/wheel well set into it. That turned a little weekend banger into a drudging nightmare. I had to modify the True Details pieces. Long story short I wasn't able to get the wheel well section in, decided to chalk it up to a lesson, and closed up the fuselage despite how ugly it looked.  Fast forward a couple of weeks and I find another one for $4. I thought ""Cool. I slap this one together real quick to practice airbrushing on."" Of course, I couldn't leave well enough alone and put together a simple cockpit as you can otherwise see through through the plane. Only problem is I got my scratch building stuff right after I mated the fuselages halves.  I did only a cursory search for methods of splitting the pieces, but I really ought to just finish them and use them for experimenting and proof of concept on a diorama project I'm building up to."

My airbrushing technique (or problems therein) often mean I get a finish that's 'powdery' or overly-matte.  It can be so bad that gloss coat can't hide it.  So before I decal (typically after basic colour and some post-shading or panel colour alteration) I buff the model with clean cotton t-shirt material. If it's really matte, I use some Mother's Plastic Polish."

modelmakers,3d6fgd,Iamdickburns,2,Mon Jul 13 22:03:50 2015 UTC,Not thinned.  Tamiya acrylic.
modelmakers,3d7dtg,Vinnie90,2,Tue Jul 14 02:28:57 2015 UTC,"So you want that oil rig looking thing to look less toyish, but look brand new...? It's possible, but a bit difficult. Usually weathering things; fading, chipping, rusting, streaking, dusting, ect; all break up a single uniform color. It makes the product look more visually interesting.  Say there was a single red square. It's not that interesting since it's all red. But then you fade it a bit, maybe do something here and there, then it becomes less uniform and more interesting.  To make that look more like the real thing, I would weather it accordingly. However, if you want to weather it and make it look brand new, that's a different story.  So a black wash is just a very thinned down enamel paint. You need it to be enamel, because acrylic isn't the best. The wash would go into the crevices of the model, and create a fake shadow. In 3D design it is SSAO/HBAO (depending on what type of modeling formate you are doing). Basically, where two things come together, a shadow will form. That's what a black wash does in principal.   However, seeing that it is 3D printed, I think you're going to run into a problem. Recently I printed out a little KV2 Russian tank to see how painting is like. The surface usually isn't so smooth like injection mold plastic, and thus you need to spend a bit of time smoothing it down. And by smoothing it down I don't mean sanding, but I mean paint filling; the process of painting the model and letting paint fill into the little gaps and imperfections of the model. This is important especially if you want a good wash. I primed the model, then painted it, then gave it a gloss coat, hen the wash. Even then, the wash wasn't perfect.  Ideally, what you would want to do is you need to give it a sprayed on gloss coat. The closes coat does a bit of this paint filling, but more importantly makes the surface tension smoother and less, therefore letting the wash easily flow into the crevices where it will be able to stick to. Then, you would need to give it a matt/flat coat if you want to dullify the shiny effect from the gloss.  As for the application for the wash, you either do a sludge or a pin. A sludge wash is when you just coat the entire model in a wash, then when it dries take an enamel thinner  to clean up areas where you don't want it. A pin wash is when you apply the wash in certain areas, and using the low surface tension of the gloss varnish, have the wash deep through the crevices and hug the extrusions, remember, either way you need that gloss coat. Personally, I think the pic wash is better for this project as you will have more control and it will still look new.  Another issue with a wash is that it doesn't build up. If you want a larger shadow from the wash due to the size be larger, then it won't work. The paint will only lightly stick to the corners, crevices, and so forth.  Another less orthodox option would be to take an airbrush and lightly paint a black shadow where the things come together.  Personally, I think giving this a wash is more hassle than reward. I think a lot can go wrong... Especially since the material of filliment used in3D printing isn't as smooth as injection plastic. Unless you have some super duper mega 3D printer, I think it's going to be hard regardless. I mean, I think I could give it a wash, with some time. But the issue ends up being there's so many variables that can go wrong. And From the looks of it, you really don't want to mess that up.   To answer your question: to smooth things out, you wash to use a paint filler, like a gloss varnish. Not sure want a 'bondo' is. Then do a pin wash. I think it might work on second inspection, but I don't want something to go wrong not because of you, but because of the plastic used."
modelmakers,3d7dtg,alaskafish,1 point,Tue Jul 14 06:35:43 2015 UTC,"An alternative to smoothing 3D printed parts would be spraying/brushing acetone on the parts, as acetone melts the plastic surface before hardening with a smooth finish. It should be noted that application must be done carefully or the acetone will eat too much. Also, the fumes on that are nasty, proper protection is required."
modelmakers,3d7dtg,Medjoe,2,Tue Jul 14 21:33:00 2015 UTC,"All right lots of info. Thanks guys!  This is a 3d printed model with no layers. Smooth on came out with a product that is called XTC 3D. It is like a thick epoxy that you coat your models with and gets rid off all of the layers. I love the stuff. It has saved me hours of sanding.   I can't use acetone on this model because just a few parts are ABS. Acetone does not affect the other materials I use. I never really like Acetone Burning because it really takes away the finer detail.   Dot filter. I have seen to on YouTube. And it looks pretty awesome. Thanks for that info.   Thanks for the wash idea. I have done it on a model house before and makes it look great. However, it didn't give it a ""newish"" look.  I think I can do very mild wash with dot filters and I should have a good looking model."
modelmakers,3d7dtg,llordlloyd,1 point,Wed Jul 15 01:40:00 2015 UTC,"A new look just means light, subtle weathering.  You can develop some airbrushing techniques, pre- and post-shading, which will alter the basic colours. This alteration of a basic colour is generally called 'filtering'. The airbrush is not the only way to achieve a filter. You can use pigments, washes, or a technique like an oil paint 'dot filter'. This last method is pretty easy, the oil paint takes a long time to dry so you have lots of time to manipulate it."

modelmakers,3d5ioe,flounderflound,3,Mon Jul 13 19:05:01 2015 UTC,"And for added depth, drybrush with a lighter shade of the base coat as well. Preferably before the wash (correct me if I've got the order mixed up)."
modelmakers,3d5ioe,BOB_9000,2,Mon Jul 13 19:49:47 2015 UTC,"The thing with black is there are no shadows, or only the most limited ones. So it's base-and-highlights. This means black is relatively easy. The U-Boat uniforms were leather (and plundered from the Italian Navy) so I'd leave them with a slight satin effect."
modelmakers,3d5ioe,llordlloyd,1 point,Mon Jul 13 22:32:45 2015 UTC,Any pics of this slight satin effect? Very interested!
modelmakers,3d5ioe,MaliciousLeigh,1 point,Mon Jul 13 23:20:39 2015 UTC,"The images in the OP link give a really good idea (I felt stupid because I wrote my post then looked at the link). The Alpine box top has the effect, and the photos of the Hitlerjugend division tank crewmen show it well.  If you paint the figures with oil paints (over a good primer), the oil paint leaves a slight gloss effect that you can tone down slightly with a mix of satin and matte varnish."

Overall, although this is an ancient kit, I am very very satisfied. The number is Tamiya 35064. Look it up. It was made first in 1960s.   The parts have little to no flash. The fit are also reasonable. Standard filing/sanding are needed especially for the 2 side exhaust grill, as they are the only parts that do not fit well.  When finished, I purchased the mica box for only USD 10 (100,000 Indonesian Rupiah) at local Ace Hardware outlet. This was originally intended for woman high-heels shoe box."

modelmakers,3d2acv,3rdCoffee,12,Sun Jul 12 23:12:48 2015 UTC,"Not model related at all, but...  Doesn't anyone else thing that a TIE crash would result in more of a forward roll rather than furrow?  The front to rear dimension of a TIE is relatively short compared to left to right and top to bottom. Lacking this ""longitudinal"" dimensions significance, I cannot help but think this should have rolled along its vector rather then ""dig"" into the ground."
modelmakers,3d2acv,JamesK1973,7,Mon Jul 13 03:42:21 2015 UTC,"Judging from the trail of debris and the trail in the sand, it looks like the tie fighter made a left turn as it was crash-landing. I agree, snagging the bottom of the ""wings"" should have caused it to roll  more, if not somersault and flip over entirely.  Obviously we don't have any Tie fighters, but if we look at WWII aircraft crash landings, we can see that hitting the lower part of a  flying vehicle on an obstruction will usually cause it to flip over if the center of mass is significantly above the obstruction. https://youtu.be/4gpCLeWqY0w?t=1m27s  The sand would probably have to be very loosely packed for it to be buried like that."

modelmakers,3d0p3o,flounderflound,1 point,Mon Jul 13 13:45:39 2015 UTC,Looks great.  Related question. What's the purpose of the wire that runs from the cockpit to the tail? Is it for structural support or is it some sort of antenna? I never see this feature on any other WWII era fighter planes.
modelmakers,3d0p3o,TooSunny,4,Sun Jul 12 16:46:01 2015 UTC,"Thanks! the wire is indeed an antenna for HF radio. I believe the late war type like P-51D did not have these wire as they switch to VHF radio which did not require a wire, just a mast."
modelmakers,3d0p3o,Nemephis,5,Sun Jul 12 17:23:06 2015 UTC,I never see this feature on any other WWII era fighter planes.   There are a lot of WWII planes with that kind of antennas.
modelmakers,3d0p3o,flounderflound,2,Sun Jul 12 19:51:40 2015 UTC,"They're pretty common - they don't show up in a lot of pictures of old WWII aircraft because they tended to be pretty thin and the cameras of that era couldn't see them very well. As a matter of fact, I have the ""Ghosts"" calendar on my wall behind my office computer as I type this and the Bf 109 has one, but even with the great camera used you can still barely see it. As far as models go, a lot of people (including myself) will represent them with thread or EZ Line (my new favorite thing in the world), although they're technically too thick."

modelmakers,3d3u6b,alaskafish,2,Mon Jul 13 08:29:24 2015 UTC,"At least 10/1, it should be so thinned that spraying somewhere should result in a layer almost invisible.   At least that's what I used on my Dragonfly"
modelmakers,3d3u6b,ionizzatore,1 point,Mon Jul 13 11:48:19 2015 UTC,"I took a look at the build. Nicely done. Must ask,miss there a certain way to spray it. Do you just spray it from a afar away place,mor in certain areas like near the running gear?   What effect is it more for? Is it for dusting, dirt, what exactly is tamiya buff dusting suppose to do?"
modelmakers,3d3u6b,ionizzatore,2,Mon Jul 13 11:51:35 2015 UTC,"Thanks  If you spray it over the whole model from far awway you create a filter, edges of the camo blend a little bit, the surface is dusty and ""dull"".  If you ""insist"" on certain areas you will create areas more dusty areas, it can be useful for areas such as the running thread of a tank, or if you want to build up dust on the sides of a rally car. Keep in mind that you will only be bale to obtain really soft edges, drawing thin, sharp lines with a color so thinned is almost impossible.  Buff is generally useful when you want to achieve a dusty aspect or ""whiten"" or ""kill"" the colors a little bit. It's warmer than gray tones but it's not bright as desert yellow or colors like that. It's also useful if you want to brighten some colors for a camo, it will alter the original color less than pure white"
modelmakers,3d3u6b,MadMorf,1 point,Mon Jul 13 12:22:03 2015 UTC,This is a great answer!  Weathering is something I have not done a lot of and good detailed advice is crucial.
modelmakers,3d3u6b,ionizzatore,1 point,Mon Jul 13 13:02:51 2015 UTC,So it's less of something that acts like a dirt and more of a filter.  Does it work well with all drank colors like panzer grey or olive green?
modelmakers,3d48jt,alaskafish,2,Mon Jul 13 11:52:34 2015 UTC,"I don't think this is necessarily a matter of who makes the kit, practically all manufacturers have some absolutely amazing ( <30£ ) kits, with a bit of research you'll probably find most of the mainstream vehicles for a reasonable price.

modelmakers,3d48jt,BOB_9000,1 point,Mon Jul 13 15:18:11 2015 UTC,"I think my problem is I mainly do 1/72. Affordable is $10, normal is 20, and expensive is 30.   Not sure how that translates to 1/35 and the larger scales. Especially considering that the larger scales are more expensive than what I'm used.

Sure there are cheap kits that go together well, but for a slightly higher price, you may also get a kit that's more accurate and/or detailed.

But the plastic they use on the 1:35 kits is really soft so you'll have to be careful when cutting small parts.  1:35 scale Old Tamiya kits, they are from the seventies but they are still good, they just lack detail and have some other minor annoyances like battery doors, holes for on/off switches and open sponsons.. But that's pretty easy to fix with some sheet plastic and filler."
modelmakers,3d1zyz,misterbingo,6,Sun Jul 12 21:48:30 2015 UTC,"I have actually been considering doing something like this since I discovered Clavework Graphics, some of the designs are incredible (more specifically a Williams Bf109, I need to get hold of a proper printer for custom decals), and it might even be an interesting groupbuild with lots of colours everywhere.   I saw a project a few months back exploring the idea, although it's on a BAe Hawk, perhaps it might be of use for inspiration. At the most basic I'd suggest getting ahold of some vector drawings of your specific vehicle, or if that isn't possible scanning the paint instructions and modifying them with some image software to clean up the camo and add your desired colours (gimp, photoshop, etc?), I'm afraid I'm not very savvy in that direction, but that's how I would tackle the matter.  Regarding decals, how are you planning to go about?"
modelmakers,3d1zyz,Medjoe,1 point,Sun Jul 12 23:34:52 2015 UTC,I will probably use decals from the kit that I buy and the rest I will paint. There are a few tips and stuff I have learnt from a friend who's into models but any advice on stripes and the like would be cool
modelmakers,3d1zyz,Medjoe,2,Mon Jul 13 15:10:48 2015 UTC,"Not many racing decals to be found in a WW2 tank kit! :) Now I'm genuinely curious on a possibility that I'll have to tinker on. What I might suggest would be looking into approximate scales for car kits. I have done some rough calculations for a NASCARand a M4 Sherman.   To start, the NASCAR is about 480cm long, and the M4 584cm. I took the car number beneath the driver where the ""door"" would be.  It's about 45cm high in real life. Now for the scales. Assuming you get a 1:43 scale NASCAR kit, which is a common scale in model cars as far as I know, the decal for that would be about 1cm tall. Onto the tank. Say you buy a 1/72 Sherman, the height of which is about 274cm. Remember the 1cm decal? It represents 72cm height in the different scale, so it's about a third more, but that's not very important, since there's no such thing as a to-scale NASCAR Sherman (but please do make one ;)).   Now let's apply the scale to see how tall is the sponson at its largest (well, that image is a bit of a cheat due to sideskirts, so I'll only consider above them and beneath turret). It's about 60cm, or in model size, a little under 2mm difference, which is really small and could still work if it slightly wraps around. But that's just a theoretical example, since not every tank is a Sherman and not every race car is a NASCAR; for instance, rally cars have smaller numbers that should have a better fit.   Regarding the stripes, on aircraft they are called cheat lines, if you're interested in researching aircraft decals, I'm not very familiar with them since I haven't done any airliners for now.   Hope it helps clarify my initial post."

As for not making them look ugly, really it's a matter of balancing out the colours, rather than the design. The design is a matter of personal preference, whereas some colours don't work with others no matter how you put it. If you're careful you have a good visualization of the your 'camo', it should look alright.  It's definitely a neat idea though, we'd love to see what the final results are :D"

modelmakers,3d290s,Dave_Real,4,Sun Jul 12 23:01:06 2015 UTC,"Well, cleanly isn't a word I'd use. These things always give me hell. It's important to keep in mind that the instructions for these types of tracks almost always lie, you'll usually need a few more or less segments here and there, so dryfitting is important. What I usually do is start with the top segment, as it's the largest. Then I go around the drive wheel, as it's relatively easy to attach to the spikes. From then on I go to the underside, which is just one long flat piece.   After this you have to get around the idler wheel, and this is the most bitchy part. So you've got everything else glued in place, then you figure out how many links you need to complete the loop (as this is the last part). After that what I find to be easiest is to attach them all in a straight line, and just run some superglue down the inside, then I attach to the lower part, and wrap it up carefully. The superglue should be strong enough to keep everything together, but still allow for manipulation and bending of the tracks.  The problem with this is that the attachment of that last segment to the top of the tracks won't be perfect, there'll be a kink in it, either it'll be too short (slightly) or it'll have an unnatural bend. Now this is generally okay, as it's on the top, so you wouldn't see it because of the fenders and whatnot, and from the side you really won't notice it.   I know this is a bit of a  word vomit, and most of it isn't bound to make much sense, but I hope it helps somehow. :D"
modelmakers,3d290s,BOB_9000,2,Sun Jul 12 23:55:21 2015 UTC,"If I may add, it would probably be best not to attach the top hull before the tracks are done, as it gives you much more room to handle the fiddly single links around the sprockets and whatnot, unless it's absolutely mandatory. Also, I'd suggest painting beforehand (at the very least the inside of the tracks, since the outside could be done afterwards)."
modelmakers,3d290s,Medjoe,2,Mon Jul 13 00:24:03 2015 UTC,"Medjoe's right, it'll save you a massive hassle. Have the entirety of the lower hull painted (including rollers and such) and the tracks painted before attaching them, and paint the upper hull before attaching it to the lower hull, so you don't risk painting the tracks too.  Another thing too, painting related, unless the rollers have rubber 'tires' around them, paint the contact points between the rollers and tracks in a somewhat shiny worn metal colour. Example"

modelmakers,3d290s,solipsistnation,2,Mon Jul 13 15:14:07 2015 UTC,"Okay, link-and-length tracks. Fun times.   I hope you haven't glued the wheels in place yet... Or if you have, use a tiny dab of CA or white glue so you can pop them off and paint them separately.   There are two ways to deal with link-and-length tracks. One is to glue them into place and paint them there. The other is to carefully glue just the tracks and paint them separately. /u/BOB_9000 has given a pretty good overview of glue-in-place. I think I'd amend that by suggesting thin plastic cement rather than superglue (it stays soft longer), and I try not to glue the wheels into place until the last minute-- at least the drive sprocket should stay loose as long as possible since that's the piece that will determine how the rest of it lines up.  So, the glue-together-separately version. This is pretty fiddly, but can look quite good.   What you want to do here is use thin plastic cement to connect the pieces of track together in a couple of separate pieces. You will need to do this while at least the drive sprocket is still movable.   Step 1: Paint your road wheels, drive sprocket, and idlers separately from the hull. You probably will have to glue on the road wheels. It is very difficult to get paint behind wheels, so make sure you don't have to by painting the hull and wheels before you hook them together. Step 1 ends with the road wheels and idler attached, but the drive sprocket loose.  Step 2: Lay out the individual links to go around the drive sprocket-- go with one less than you think you'll need. Hit the places where links touch with a dab of liquid cement-- it should get sucked down into the joint by capillary action. It will take some time to cure, so you have a little while where the tracks will be flexible (but kind of delicate).   Wrap this section around the drive sprocket (it doesn't have to be on the hull here)-- you want to have some idea where it'll end up, so you can aim each end at the next piece. These are pieces 11 and 14 in your picture there. It looks like that's upside-down, too, so piece 11 is the top of the run. So you're going to not worry about that right now. You'll need to later, but not quite yet.   Set aside the little curve of tracks wrapped around the sprocket until it dries hard. You should be able to remove it from the sprocket and have a little curve you can handle without breaking it. This is important since you'll be painting it soon.  Step 2.5: Get part 12 and part 15 glued together and curved around that road wheel, and possibly attached to part 14. Push the drive sprocket and its track onto the hull and get it lined up with the other bits of track.   Step 3: Do something similar to step 2 with the bits of track indicated for the idler and that end of the track run. This should be a bunch of 15s and 16s, part 13 and a 15 and a 16. Try to get a little length of track you can move around. You have a little more flexibility here because you don't have to deal with the drive sprocket.  Step 4: You should now have a couple of curves (the drive sprocket and idler, which has a flat length and a couple of extra links on each end), a flat piece with an extra link on the end (12+15), and part 11. You may be short one link on the drive sprocket. If you test-fit all the parts and they don't go all the way around, add in that spare link. This looks like something with alternating links, so you may not have any choice here. The top run, part 11, is where you're going to have to make up any mistakes, so be careful. Ideally you won't have to.  Step 5: Set up just the track in a sort of ring, pushed together and standing on its edge. Spray prime it and paint it however you want, trying not to get too much paint on the ends where the different segments will go together. Don't worry if you can't help it. Get your tracks nice-looking, separately from the hull and wheels which I assume you have either already painted or will be painting soon. Make sure the painted parts still fit together cleanly and aren't clogged with paint or anything.  Step 6: Put some cement on the drive sprocket's axle where it joins the hull. Set the painted track into place and start aligning the drive sprocket and track so that all the painted parts fit together. Use a little super-thin CA glue to hook them into place (applying it from the inside of the road wheels or other places where it won't be visible or too obvious). Just use enough to hook the tracks down. Yes, you're gluing painted surfaces but as long as you're gentle with them this should be okay.  You're done with track stuff. Give the whole vehicle some weathering, clearcoat it, take pictures, post them, lay back and watch your imaginary internet points pile up.   Does this make sense? It is very fiddly, but it lets you do a lot of track stuff that's hard to do after everything is hooked together."
modelmakers,3d290s,solipsistnation,1 point,Mon Jul 13 04:42:45 2015 UTC,"Another viable approach, I agree with everything, except for using cement (and this really could come down to personal preference), I find cement to not hold together very well at all, whereas superglue has just enough force to not fall apart. Another issue I find with that is that cement slightly dissolves plastic, which could become problematic when cocking up. With superglue, if something needs to be changed or reattached, the shape of the track won't change too much, and the links are still weak enough to be pulled apart.   Granted, though, if you trust yourself enough to nail it the first time, cement would be the better choice,"
modelmakers,3d290s,BOB_9000,1 point,Mon Jul 13 15:07:01 2015 UTC,"I find CA is messy and gets all over, while thin cement can be applied with a brush and will suck down into the crevices and stay soft for long enough to move stuff around...  Sounds like personal preference to me. 8)"
modelmakers,3d290s,solipsistnation,2,Mon Jul 13 15:15:43 2015 UTC,"I had this type of threads, only difference was every single link was separate. It takes patience and some knowledge to complete this task. The main thing I'll advise is to not glue the wheels to your hull. Instead, put them on the hull, glue the threads to the wheels, and paint that separately. example : http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7193/6868576622_6f1ec7986c.jpg hope that helps."

This is what works for me, and it holds strong enough to put up with rc use.  1: use your knife to scratch up the mating surfaces. The more scratches the better. This boosts surface area by an order of magnitude, which is key, and skipping this step means total failure.  2: CA the joint.  3: clamp it tight. I use forceps on the second notch. If you arent deforming the track you arent clamping it tight enough.  4: wait about fifteen mins.  5: congrats! That joint will need an act of congress to break.

CA glue is basically super glue +. It will burn your skin and if you attach something to your skin, the ony way of removal is... Well,  nsfw. But it costs about for bucks at any hobby shop.   It's a Cyanoacrylate. With chemistry knowledge, you'll know why it works. It's a fast setting adhesive used in the medical world. Came to the public in 1980 something. It's also called a power glue because of it's considerably stronger strength to super glue  Great stuff for tracks."

Your natural body oils will remove the glue without having to peel off your skin.  I highly recommend them. I used to hate rubber tracks, and now I adore them. First time I used the glue I was absolutely amazed. You only put maybe a sprinkle's amount and it will keep the track together even when you pull them.  Staples are terrible in my opinion as they usually rip the track when you try to fit it on the running gear. And heating and melting are terrible because they'll ruin the tracks and you'll lose tons of detail"

In my experience that tends to take practically all/most of the shine away.  Alternatively, a satin coat, if you want minimal weathering.  Or, if you've got it available, Humbrol's metalcote. If this video's any indication, it works wonders, as you can buff it to just the right shine. ->  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn9_Y7v0PXI"

Only extras I used was an Eduard upgrade set for the railings and some other small details on the ship such as the ladders, stairs, etc. Really surprised at how easy the railings were to mount, and the fit was absolutely perfect. I took a lot of inspiration in this build from Bill Plunk's own build over on his website, it's one of the reasons I choose to build this kit.   I scribed the upper deck in order to make it a wood deck, and I think it turned out pretty good. I just painted it a mixture of model master wood and sandy brown, and then did a filter of a light brown acrylic color followed by a darker brown wash for the panel lines.   Looking back there's a few places I could have touched up the wash and other weathering a bit before sealing everything up, but I'm pretty satisfied with how it turned out. I had no idea how to do the rigging properly, as I couldn't find any good reference pictures of Z-38, and Dragon was ambiguous on their artwork, but I did find a few other modelers who tackled this subject and took inspiration from them. I used EZ-line to do the rigging and it is really worth it if you've never used it before. So much better than using stretched sprues like I have in the past.   Next up I am going to be building a 1/350 Dragon Scharnhorst battleship with a Flyhawk upgrade set as well as a Nautilus wooden deck upgrade and a set of brass propellers to replace the plastic ones.

modelmakers,3cyc1i,flounderflound,2,Sun Jul 12 00:21:32 2015 UTC,"I tend to like over-exaggeration with things like these, considering  military vehicles didn't have much in the way of colour variation, which leads to a somewhat bland look. I think your weathering compensates for that perfectly, it adds variation while still staying true to what the machine should look like. You should leave the wash as it is IMHO."

It's not perfect nor even good but I'm still proud none the less, but I thought I'd post it here for some criticism and tips. So if you have any tips on how I could improve upon my next model and what not let me know! I'd love to hear and learn from some of you more experienced builders as I'm just a young (14 years old) novice aha."
modelmakers,3czrhd,alaskafish,5,Sun Jul 12 06:58:31 2015 UTC,"Very nice first. I'm surprised everyone here has so much better looking first models than I had.  So some thing to take into account for next time:  I suggest painting the tank.... Even if the plastic is already that color. Why? Because it first gives the model the proper color (your case olive green, the plastic is more dark forest green). Not only that, but it will remove that glare from the plastic and make it look less toyish. Also, it will cover any defects, like plastic Spurs, or glue stains. Not as important, but the hatch and the extra fuel tank were painted the same color as the tank.  Also not as important, but the right tack (assuming you look from the back to the front) is on backwards.  Secondly, to improve over all build quality, use filler. Any filler would do. I prefer model filler, but you can use spackle, it just requires a lot more sanding. In the front of your tank, there's a large gap. That's going to be aparent in all your next model kits; gaps. Take some filler, put it over the gap, rub your finger on it and press it into the gap. Then, sand the rest off so it looks more like part of the model. Then just paint over it with what ever the color is suppose to be.  As for weathering, you need to weather the tank accordingly. Take a look at some pictures (preferably colored) of tanks. The dirtier the better. You'll see that mud isn't just in groups randomly placed on the tank. Usually, they're clustered on the tracks, the lower running gear, the lower front and back glacis, and on the fenders and side skirts. Next time, take your mud and put the mud there.   Other than that, great model. Can't wait to see you progress through time."
modelmakers,3czrhd,alaskafish,1 point,Sun Jul 12 07:11:39 2015 UTC,"Thank you for the info! I was a little under prepared on this model haha, and still have the habit of over looking small but important features such as track direction. I also get a little carried away with the mud sometimes as you can tell. Another thing, I'll for sure try what you said about filling that gap. It was probably one of the most irritating things for me on this model...Next time I have some cash and can get to the local hobby store I'll probably pick up some more advanced items I guess you could say. Instead of the basic brush glue paint etc that I've been using"
modelmakers,3czrhd,alaskafish,1 point,Sun Jul 12 07:26:06 2015 UTC,"Usually, these advanced items are only worth picking up if you want to stay in the hobby... Like an airbrush.   For you, I suggest getting some tamiya or testers filler. It comes in a tooth paste looking thing. If you will be working with rubber tracks, it's really worth picking up some CA glue (Cyanoacrylate). It's basically ridiculously strong super glue. Other things would be a hobby knife, sand paper (smaller grit), and a sanding file, which are pretty cheap.   Other things are usually not necessary. Things like rivitors, scribers, ect. And an airbrush is really useful, but I wouldn't be buying one until you are sure you enjoy the hobby and you actually know what you are doing (they can go from$100 to $5000"
modelmakers,3czrhd,alaskafish,1 point,Sun Jul 12 07:41:48 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah, one more question. This is kinda an ignorant question, but what order should I build and paint the model In for tanks? Should I build the actual body and leave the tracks off then put them on after I've painted the main body (turret, hull, and what not) I'm asking this because I'd really like to improve upon the quality of my models and really have no 100% idea on what to change up. I've looked up a few YouTube videos but thought I'd just ask if that's fine with you."
modelmakers,3czrhd,alaskafish,3,Mon Jul 13 06:24:36 2015 UTC,"Not ignorant at all! That is just a question.  The way I would paint models is much different because of the airbrush. But I can tell you how you should paint. I'm assuming you brush paint because this was your first tank and most people don't have an airbrush laying around.  Usually for tanks, I build everything first. However, I keep the tracks off (if they're rubber), the turret, and sometimes the wheels and/or the upper hull. If the wheels are hard to paint I'll me them off (like if they're too small like the panzer III and IV). And I'll leave the hull off if I plan to weather behind the running gear heavily... But usually it's the turret, body, and tracks that I leave separate. This also includes filler, and scrap building if you so chose. Build everything and attach it but those three and then paint.  For you (brush painting) I would start with the base color. Sometimes you need to thin the paint to get the best result. What I do is I first give the model a first coat. Usually this coat is super sloppy and acts as a primer (holds the paint on). Then, continue slowly and gradually building up that color until it looks better. But remember, the paint should almost be like a milky consistency, enough that it doesn't run, but enough that it's heavy.   After the base color is on, then do big details like the tires on the wheels, ect. Don't forget to paint the tracks too. If you have rubber tracks, attach the to get the O shape, after you paint it, with CA glue.   Then paint smaller details like tools, ect.   After that, you're done painting. I always suggest that you buy two rattle spray cans. One a glossy varnish and one a dull/matt varnish. First, spray the glossy varnish. This makes the surface nice and smooth. This makes the application of decals a lot better. It will stick to the surface easily, and also adhere to the irregularities like rivets and extrusions easier. It really helps if you have MicroSol as well (a product that softens up the decal after application, watch a video or two on it). Then after the decals are good, give the model another, but quick, glossy varnish to protect the decals.   Now, you just weather it to all your hearts content. Give it a filter or a wash. Do some fading or pigment powders, adddirt and mud. There's tons of people who would be willing to help you on that much more advanced weathering.   After you weather, give the model a nice flat varnish from the spray can and it will no longer look glossy."

(sorry for all them btw) so, when or if the time comes that I get interested in an airbrush would this compressor work? Or does it absolutely need to be a certain type. http://m.harborfreight.com/1-3-hp-3-gallon-100-psi-oilless-air-compressor-97080.html   I should clarify, I'm asking as I already own this compressor and don't want to waste money on another one unless needed whenever I do decide if I would like a brush"
modelmakers,3d01vh,Camarupim,3,Sun Jul 12 09:51:26 2015 UTC,"Well a few things to start with. Get a magnifying glass or some sort of magnification and then take your airbrush needle out, place it in a perfectly flat surface, if you have a glass table top or have a pane of glass around thats best. Roll the needle and watch the tip of it, if its warped bobs around or you see that the very tip has any bends in it, you've probably found your problem. Also check the nozzle bit and ensure that it doesn't appear damaged or bent on the small end where the needle protrudes. Lastly check the regulator and tip section, the holes in the regulator should all be clean and you should be able to see light through them. Ensure the needle is pushed all the way forwards while the lock nut is free, just push until it stops and then tighten the locknut.  Set the air regulator to 20PSI if this is a gravity feed NEO CN, or TRN, 25PSI if this is the NEO BCN to start and get some Vallejo surface primer if you have it. You want to depress the trigger on the airbrush and adjust the pressure while holding the airflow open on the airbrush to 20PSI, The resting air pressure is misleading and you'll see when you press the trigger the pressure dips, you want the press when it dips to be 20PSI, not the resting pressure. Load it up and find some spare sprue bits along with a few sheets of paper. I suggest Vallejo primer because it's excellent at self leveling but paint will do, Most people tend to have larger amounts of primer also. Do not thin the primer for now, it should be thin enough to do some basic testing.  Make sure you have some paper towel or other cloth you don't mind getting paint on and a bit of airbrush cleaner or windex as well for cleaning the airbrush tip.   Begin releasing air over a piece of paper, does any paint come out at all, get super close and check for anything coming out without the trigger pulled back. If you get anything coming out other than air, stop, your airbrush isn't right. If nothing comes out thats good, Slowly pull the trigger back until just the faintest bit of paint begins to come out while holding the trigger stead, spray lines back and fourth without releasing the trigger until the paint flow stops, when it stops this is known as dry tip and is fairly common with acrylics in general. Release the air and trigger and using the paper towel and a few drops of the cleaner/windex on the cloth and clean the tip thoroughly until you can see no more paint. Repeat this step several times and gradually increase the paint flow. Find a point where you spray that the paint on the surface feels smooth and not sandy/gritty.   If the drytipping occurs  almost instantly you may want to pick up some needle Juice. Open the bottle, dip the clean needle into it (They tend to have dropper lids, just unscrew it) until it almost touches the bottom of the bottle, then bring it out letting the excess drip back into the bottle, then re-insert it into the airbrush and try spraying again. It should reduce the amount of dry-tipping.  Once you have learned a smooth consistent spray on paper, start working on bits of sprue following the same methods, move at a constant rate when spraying and maintain about 4-6 inches from the surface you are spraying.   The idea is when spraying you want to see the surface take on a slight gloss effect from the wet paint but not get to the point where it pools. The advantage of Vallejo surface primer is that its pretty hard to get it to pool and even if it does it tends to self-level really well. If the paint is sandy and gritty then its partially drying before it hits the surface. This can be sanded out over multiple layers but is just not optimal.   If you just cannot get the paint to flow somewhat smoothly at this point then you need to consider thinning with a thinner that also has a drying retarder. Vallejo's own Airbrush thinner works really well, basically I fill the cup with about 5-7 drops of thinner and then fill the cup up about half way and using a stirring stick I mix it all together thoroughly. You can also try adjusting the pressure on the airbrush regulator up or down by 5PSI. The general rule of thumb is the thinner the paint is the lower PSI you can use. Most gravity feed airbrushes can comfortably spray Vallejo paints at 12-20PSI.   Links:  Needle juice I use, REGDAB  Vallejo Surfrace primer gray(VERY light gray)  Vallejo airbrush thinner  I hope this helps some! I'm not a pro by any means but this is how I learned myself so just passing it along, good luck and stick with it!"
modelmakers,3d01vh,HandBanaba,2,Sun Jul 12 11:06:24 2015 UTC,"Thanks for this great reply - a lot what you suggest I haven't tried. I need to spend a bit more time experimenting with my technique using primer (I have a bottle of Vallejo bronze green primer I can use). I am definitely getting gritty finish, so I'll need to pay attention to paint volume and distance to surface.  I've checked the needle a couple of times and it seems to be fine. I have had some issues with air leaks on the nozzle, but not all the time."
modelmakers,3d01vh,HandBanaba,2,Sun Jul 12 14:39:44 2015 UTC,"I've read a good deal about the Neo needing a bit of teflon tape around the nozzle threads to help seal it up, It's similar to plumbers tape but I'd suggest going to Walmart or a hardware store and look near where they sell compressor instead of the plumbing section. A roll should cost less than $3 at walmart, It's thinner than the plumber variety.  The sandy finish can be combated in several ways. One way is to simply get a bit closer when spraying and move side to side a bit faster so the paint has less time to travel and less time to pool up.   Second option, Drop to 15 PSI and try it out, You may want to graduate it down so like 20 > 18 > 15 PSI increments.   If you're not going full back on the trigger, just giving it more may also help. Try a combo of these after you try each suggestion separately and just keep trying until you start getting better results.   Edit: After re-reading I realized I'm really tired so sorry to reiterate anything you already know, etc, I just want to be helpful and hope you succeed! :-)"

Oddly enough I have a roll of plumbers tape I'd bought to seal any leaks on the compressor (there wasn't anything sigificant), it's quite fine stuff, but I'd never considered that I could use it on the airbrush. I'd tried less effective solutions like Chapstick. Cheers!"
modelmakers,3d01vh,Destructias_Warlord,2,Sun Jul 12 15:26:23 2015 UTC,"All of this is good advice.  Another tip is to keep the airbrush moving constantly, never let it hover over one area.  If you still get pooling, you are spraying too much paint at once, don't pull the trigger all the way, or you are too close.  Practice on some paper or some junk until you get the feel for it, Iwata's are good airbrushes and should allow you to do a good paint job."
modelmakers,3cy25i,BOB_9000,3,Sat Jul 11 20:29:57 2015 UTC,A lot of direct hits from AP shells are just simple holes. Just drilling a hole would create a pretty convincing direct hit. Just make sure you take the right calibre. 30 mm. hits on the front armor of a King Tiger isn't realistic :)  Unless said King Tiger was pulled out of a museum out of sheer desperation and was facing a BMP2 or something

I don't think those holes were drilled though, notice the slight denting around them.

After painting the whole model I added metallic paint with a small brush to make it look, well, like metal.    Behind the open hatch is the radio-equipment and the first aid kit which Fritz needed because he is wounded.   And thanks for the compliment but I'm no wizard, just a guy trying different techniques.

I have some model master acrylic dull cote that I decided to lightly  brush on to see if that would solve the problem until I could apply a sealant of Future over the whole thing.   Well, the dull cote began to ever-so-slightly run the green paint off the nose and onto the cowl decals, staining the white of the cowl decals green.   I tried to clean the discoloration  with a moist q-tip. Not only did  the black start coming off the cowl decal, but the green stain spread.  Then I dipped the q-tip in windex, hoping I could clean the stain on the decal that way. The windex reacted to the decal making things far worse.  One thing lead to another and every decision I made seemed to compound the previous error.   When I came to my senses, I had sanded the nose to the point you see here. Luckily...if there is a silver lining...I have scanned the decals. I guess my option now is to use the scanned decal, create a series of paint masks, and repaint the whole nose.  That, or just put it back in the box and work on something else for awhile..."

I need to take a break from Mustangs for awhile, and do something that I can paint camo (which is more forgiving, anyway).  My heart sank too, so I appreciate the condolences. But , I'm over it now. The mail gods delivered a Tamiya Razorback P-47D from Japan that I have been waiting on for about 8 weeks, and a Hasegawa P-40e that I found for a ridiculously low price on Amazon and just had to have. Fate is telling me to move on... ha.   I'm also not exceptionally fond of the Mustang (I know this puts me in the minority).

My criticisms of it are minor, but I kept a build log here with some notes: http://m.imgur.com/a/YwE62  I've done two Thunderbolts recently, so I might hold off on the Razorback until next year. I've decided that I'm going to enter a contest in November, so I'm going to do do a double build and take the better kit. I'll build the Hasegawa P-40e (for the groupbuild) and either get another Tamiya P-51D (I can't let that beat me), or jump into the 'Bolt (but this time do a proper NMF)."

modelmakers,3cvlji,HandBanaba,5,Sat Jul 11 03:35:54 2015 UTC,"To echo those above; Proper thinning is important with Tamiya paints. I've only used them sparingly and can say that they are somewhat more difficult to brush paint than other brands but it is doable with proper thinning and mixing.  I suggest picking up one of these: Badger paint mixer  These will really help smooth out the paint and really mix the pigments together, you just run it along the bottom all over for at least 30 seconds and you'll have perfectly mixed paint ready for thinning. This helps prevent the paint from getting thicker and thicker as the level in the pot gets lower."

Compressed air, mention above, might work but you run the risk of blowing things off the model that might not be adhered well after years of sitting.   My suggestion is to get a very soft brush, similar to what a woman might apply powdered makeup with, and lightly dust the model off.   My father worked on a model of the Cutty Sark for literally 30 years. He would take it off the mantle in the winter and work on it. He had a little brush that has a soft plastic bulb on it that could be squeezed to blow air while brushing stuff. I believe it was intended for cleaning camera lenses. It worked well, but none of this dust was cigarette smoke that does tend to be, for lack of a better word, sticky.   Here is a thought: call a company like Serv Pro that cleans household items after fire damage. They might be able to either clean it, or give you advice on what to do."

modelmakers,3ctngw,sleepwalker77,3,Fri Jul 10 18:04:33 2015 UTC,"Here's a previous discussion on the topic. Copying my response from there:  3D Printing has played a solid part in scale modelling for quite some time now. Here are some of the ways it has been used:   To quickly produce an accurate master from which a mold can be made, through which resin copies can be cast. Examples of this include Orange Hobby's kits, where you can actually see the ""stepping"" on diagonal surfaces that are a product of the layer-by-layer process of 3D printing. Traditionally, cottage companies who produce resin kits would have to spend quite some time to create the original master from scratchbuilt parts, which can result in rather ""messy"" or inaccurate models if the maker of the master is not sufficiently skilled. 3D printing changes this by putting the onus on the CAD maker.  Shapeways.com - a website where you can upload CAD designs and have a company (Shapeways) print the part you need when you need it and ship it to you (and through which you can buy parts printed using CAD that someone else uploaded). Large companies like these have the financial resources to acquire and operate the high-end 3D printers that are capable of much higher resolution and quality than the ones you can get for your home. This allows you to have model parts that are actually comparable to (though rarely as good as) parts made from traditional injection molded plastic or resin casting. This business model allows modelers to ""make"" parts that are otherwise economically infeasible for injection or resin. Examples include specific oddball aircraft for aircraft carriers in 1/540ish and 1/700 scales, as well as corrected/more accurate parts for kits where the manufacturer did not do their due diligence when conducting research (e.g. Trumpeter's 1/350 HMS Belfast gun arrangement, which requires a new piece if you want to accurately depict the centre barrel's offset).  Some cottage companies such as Imperial Hobby Productions offer parts for their limited-run kits for purchase through Shapeways - again, it's simply more economical to everyone involved when the parts have such low demand, especially for smaller parts. Producing parts that are otherwise impossible - the best example is probably the US battleship ""cage masts"". A complex lattice with a hyperboloid shape, this feature has never been accurately produced for the casual modeler, unless by tedious assembly of individual rods. Up until this year, cage masts have been approximated by rolling a sheet of photo-etched brass into a cone, with the lattice pattern etched into it. It looks the part, but remains a cone as opposed to a hyperboloid. The nature of 3D printing resolves this problem by allowing you to print a hyperboloid in a single piece. As you can see though, material strength and resolution limitations result in a product that's not quite as delicate as the less accurate photoetched version - much work remains to be done in this regard. For larger-scale one-off models, one can employ 3D printing more directly and extensively - a good example being this 1/72nd scale Hero-class patrol vessel, where almost everything was 3D printed: http://www.modelshipgallery.com/gallery/misc/patrol/CCGPatrol-72-pm/index.htm"
modelmakers,3ctngw,Timmyc62,1 point,Fri Jul 10 19:47:43 2015 UTC,"This is pretty much the right answer. All of it really. 3D printing is not, and likely never be, quite as good as actual molding.

As many as you wanted. You don't have to buy a single tiger tank for $20 at the hobby shop. And if they made it too expensive, no one would buy it... Or worse; pirates. People would upload files and then everyone would eventually have every model available for free on the Pirates bay."

modelmakers,3ctngw,flounderflound,1 point,Fri Jul 10 20:33:11 2015 UTC,I'll also add that there's some intense work that goes into the designs from the modeling companies lately. Have you read up on Airfix's new tooling? They're going out with radar equipment and taking 3D scans and translating that into their CAD software before making the molds. It's part of why their new stuff is coming out with such high quality. I'll take that over some random dude on the internet who made his own CAD model for a 3-D printer anyday. Here's an article if you're interested.
modelmakers,3ctngw,MrBlankenshipESQ,2,Fri Jul 10 21:46:59 2015 UTC,"On top of that 3d printers cant do smooth curves or angles. Everything is in layers, which adds steps to the parts, which makes assembly far more laborious."
modelmakers,3ctngw,flounderflound,1 point,Sat Jul 11 07:27:58 2015 UTC,"Oh, totally. Granted, ordinary printers today are far better than the dot matrix printers we had in the 1980s, so I'm sure 3D printers will improve, but unless they can massively change the mechanics of it, it wouldn't be enough for proper modeling. When it comes to resolution, a smooth-looking surface on a computer screen (resolution) versus real-life resolution are going to be two very different things. I just don't see the point of it. Not everything in life needs to be downloaded from the internet.  About 7 months ago somebody posted a 3D printed T-80 that looked pretty impressive. He also said it took him 9 months and a whole lot of work. And a massive amount of sanding, because as you said, the resolution is nowhere near."

modelmakers,3ctngw,flounderflound,2,Fri Jul 10 18:45:41 2015 UTC,What if you could print a kit without the middleman? Tamiya (for example) sells a file and you print that off with your personal printer?

Often they're better-researched and closer to the correct size (and barrel wall thickness) than kit parts, especially on cheapish kits, and they often have rifling. (The metal and resin barrel on my AMX-13 looks SO much better than the kit part...)  I will usually try to acquire a metal barrel for any tank I'm building, just because they start off looking good. It can save, potentially, an hour or two of messing around."

It's ridiculously difficult to include rifling in a plastic gun barrel, but in a turned aluminum one the same exact process used to rifle small caliber air guns can add the necessary rifling detail to the tank model barrel as well.  I don't go out of my way to get metal guns for my tanks, but if I'm given the choice by a kit I'll happily use the metal one over the plastic one."

modelmakers,3csyyu,Camarupim,2,Fri Jul 10 15:00:29 2015 UTC,"Scenario: you need to mix/thin two or more liquids for the purposes of airbrushing them. I'm curious how others achieve this.  How do you measure and decant the paint/thinners - disposable pipettes, straws etc? Where do you mix - separate container, new bottle, airbrush cup?"
modelmakers,3csyyu,ionizzatore,2,Sun Jul 12 09:53:52 2015 UTC,"If i need to prepare big quantities of paint that i need to use in different times (i.e.: ""IDF Sinai Gray"" for a tank, not ""a shade of green to highlight some area"") i generally mix them in a spare bottle (tamiya X/XF bottle or even better Tamiya X-20A 45ml), measuring the colors in ""parts"", this means that if i need to mix an 1:1 ratio i use X quantity of color A measured in height from the bottom and the same quantity of color B, if i need a 5:1 ratio i pour and measure the height of color A and then add 1/5 of color B.  Then i add the thinner. Keep in mind that you can easily thin the paint but you cant un-thin it  If i need small quantities of paint i generally mix them in the cup of the airbrush (my usual X10+XF10 for exhausts, brighter tones for highlighting areas, black ""lightened"" with gray for tires...) without precise proportions, i stop when i'm sathisfied with the color.   If i need to mix really small quantities of paint, i generally mix them in the cup of the airbrush with this method: i pour some thinner until i can see it rise from the bottom of the cup, then i count the drops of paint for each color using a toothpick (i dip the toothpick in the color then i let a drop fall in the cup, repeat). In the end i mix the paint with the toothpick, spray the thinner that is still in the channel and i'm ready to retouch tiny details"

IMHO the best solution is to display the models in display cases/shelves and ""pre-allocate"" the space for the model on the shelf. I mean: are you building a tank? Decide where the tank will be displayed and then place your work in progress in that location, pick it up when you start, place it there when you finish. Assembled wheels, hull, turret, every part that needs to ""rest"" should go there.  If the display case is somehow dust proof you can also use the cabinet to let the paint dry in peace"

Thin your paint properly and expect to have to paint a bunch of layers before getting to the level of transparency/hue you want. Don't rush it, wait for stuff to dry, and use a good flat brush.  Decals like to adhere to smooth (glossy) surfaces better than rough (matte) surfaces. Have you tried doing a layer of gloss coat before applying the decals?"

modelmakers,3cryxw,alaskafish,3,Fri Jul 10 08:06:04 2015 UTC,"Top three:  1: Tamiya. They offer great kits, well molded, practically build themselves with accuracy far faaaaaaaar in excess of anything I ever ask for in a model kit. Love 'em. Also, most of their tanks have vinyl tracks and polycapped wheels, which is a selling point for me believe it or not. Makes it real easy to turn them into RC tanks, which being that RC is another big hobby of mine makes tank models equipped as such very attractive to me.  2: Trumpeter. Some of their kits are hit-and-miss so homework is necessary, but a lot of their stuff is Tamiya grade. I built their 1/35th KV-2(Box turret version) and it was, as is the case with Tamiya kits, pretty much self-building. That one took quite nicely to radio control as well, and is currently my only RC tank.  3: AFV Club. Only built one of their kits, a full interior T-34/85, and while the tracks are positively loathesome the rest of the tank was wonderful. Proud to have it sitting on my desk. Bit fiddly to build, but that's to be expected with a /35th full interior tank. Almost disappointed that all the interior work is hidden inside the hull out of sight and out of mind, though.  Worst:   1: Revell. While I grew up on them, have fond memories of building their cars and ships and planes as a kid, place the blame for me being a modeller squarely on their shoulders, and honestly probably will still buy them for certain subjects, they are maybe a third the quality of Tamiya. It's a shame Tamiya's car line doesn't have muscle cars, american pickup trucks and the like. But they don't, so Revell is pretty much my only option if I desire such a vehicle in my collection."
modelmakers,3cryxw,MrBlankenshipESQ,2,Fri Jul 10 08:37:11 2015 UTC,"My list is gonna raise some eyebrows for sure, so here's some backstory. I've been building for about 24 years. In my teenage years, anytime I'd scrounge up five or ten dollars I'd run to my local hobby shop that happened to sell a lot of cheap stuff because they specialized in rare and out-of-producton models (and a lot of older stuff isn't worth much). By the age of 18 I had built a lot. I stopped counting after 216 or so. I'm 32 now - I slowed down and even stopped for a while but really picked up again about 2 or 3 years ago.  By now I've built my B-17s, Bf 109s and Spitfires - several times in many cases. So nowadays I find myself building planes that spark my interest - rare and unusual stuff. The stuff you don't see much of. My favorites are largely based on that. My top three are not in order top to bottom, they're just my top three. Tamiya doesn't make my list, for instance, because most of their subjects in the scale I build (1/72) are fairly generic. They're fantastic kits, but not my favorites (however, the M6A1 Seiran kit is one I've eagerly got in my queue).  1) Italeri. There's a lot of unusual and unconventional stuff they've made over the years. Even now on their website they offer a lot of cool and unusual stuff, and the quality is usually pretty good. Is it high-end? Certainly not. But they're getting better and better and still offer a wide selection. They have a Do 24 out right now that even comes with PE parts.  2) Hasegawa. While the kits don't come with PE or anything spectacular, the parts themselves tend to have pretty good detail, the decals tend to be pretty extensive (even including swastikas for German planes) and they have a wide selection, making many kits other companies haven't touched. The only downfall to Hasegawa kits is that sometimes the molds are terrible and their plastic can get hard and brittle with age. But their subjects are second to none, especially if you want to do Japanese aircraft.  3) Airfix. Calm down. Airfix is my go-to company when I want to do an easy kit. Revell is also, but not as much. Airfix's kits tend to be pretty simple, and as they've been re-tooling they've come out with some really impressive kits that go together really well. The subjects are interesting and they are often fun to build, where some model companies' kits can be very tedious and stressful. Airfix has had some total bastard kits over the years, but I think they're really turning things around and I look forward to see what they come up with from here.  WORST:  1) Heller kits suck ass. The directions are weird and the fitment will make you pull your hair out. That is all.  2) AMT/ERTL. There are a few acceptable kits I've built from them, but most have been sheer crap. Parts don't fit together well and shapes are frequently off. Also, their decals are crap.  3) Lindberg. If you want to build a toy-quality model that fits poorly and barely resembles the subject it's supposed to be, buy a Lindberg kit. I hate Lindberg more than any other manufacturer out there and will never buy another, no matter what the subject is.  Edit: changed my worst #2 from Revell to AMT. Apparently I had blocked out my nightmares of AMT kits. I originally was writing Airfix as my #3 (love and hate), but caught myself comparing their old kits to Lindberg kits, then realized I had mentally blocked out Lindberg because I hated them so bad."
modelmakers,3cryxw,flounderflound,2,Fri Jul 10 14:51:48 2015 UTC,"I'm glad we all share a common hatred of Revell, or at least Revell America. Their German counterpart seems to be very, well, German, which is nice. :D My favourites, granted I've only finished four tanks and some figures:   Academy. This one tends to not get much praise, and for good reason, their old stuff is beyond awful. However they seem to have changed something recently. For a decently cheap price, everything seems to fit as it should, and the builds are fantastic. Tamiya. I haven't built any vehicles from them, bur reading some of these comments I wish I have. I've been working on a set of russian infantry lately, and as much as I bitch and moan about it, the detail is fantastic, and they go together without a hitch, I'm really pleasantly surprised. Italeri. Haven't completely finished anything from them, but painting is not something specific to a kit, the build of a C47 I've been working on was one of the most enjoyable I've done (first aircraft and all).   I feel I should mention Trumpeter on here for their fantastic KV-2 :D."

modelmakers,3cryxw,flounderflound,2,Fri Jul 10 15:39:56 2015 UTC,"Top three:  Tamiya, just really can't go wrong with Tamiya. I think they have a handful of bad kits and that's it. If I want a fun, quick, and easy build then I go with Tamiya because it's pretty much guaranteed. Though their decals suck.  Meng, I've only actually built one of their kits. The French F-17 Light Tank. Everything fit real nice but it's just so small which is no fault of Meng. They do a nice variety of subjects. Modern US and Russian armor to very obscure WW1 and WW2 tanks. As well as an Ford F-350 which is just as good. They're a fairly new company and looking at scalemates they're first release was in 2011 or 2012 and as the saying goes they really hit the ground running. Most companies have some growing pains and take some time to go from just another kit manufacturer to a top of the line setting the standards for molding and I think Meng has done an excellent job and can't wait for more. I do however think that they might suffer from the same thing as Dragon and over engineer some stuff. Mold something in 10 different pieces when it could have been done in half as many or less. Only reason Meng isn't number 1 for me is just simplicity. Meng kits have a ton of plastic whereas a lot of Tamiya kits have less then 150 pieces.  Trumpeter and Academy. Really tough decision for me as I just haven't built enough of either to make a good decision. I really like that they both have a wide range of subjects. I've only built one of each and both were really nice. Trumpeter kit had excellent detail and some minor fit issues and some flash and the Academy kit just went together like a dream.  Top  worst:  Revell. The bad thing with Revell is they can make good kits and what I really hate about them is they'll take a 30+ year old kit just put it in a new box. You look at the box and might think ""oh, 2013 pretty new"" that's just when they reboxed it and the mold is still old. I feel those kits have no business being out on the market as the only people that are probably going to buy them are the kids that are curious about the hobby and then when they get home nothing fits and so they quit forever.  AMT/ERTL, I pretty much ignore anything of theirs. I bought the GTO and it was so poorly molded that you couldn't read the numbers on the sprues.  TL;DR:  Tamiya if you want simple.  Meng if you want highly detailed yet easy to assemble.  Trumpeter/Academy if you want a wide variety of subjecs.  Revell needs to stop reboxing the same kit over and over.  AMT/ERTL not even once."

Their 1:32 scale aircraft are absolutely amazing, check out their new Mosquito coming out this month... My main gripe with Tamiya is the lack of photo etch for smaller details on their armor kits. I understand why they don't include it (to make things simple), but they could really benefit from it.   2) Zoukei-Mura is an excellent company for 1:32 scale aircraft, they are doing some amazing things, and so is HK models, another 1:32 aircraft manufacturer.   3) Dragon has honestly been declining in quality in recent years, but they still put out good kits every year. Just with they would get over the Nazi fascination and make more American and British AFVs. Their ship kits are also very nice, just recently finished their Z-38 destroyer and it was an excellent kit.   Honorable mentions: - Hasegawa - excellent aircraft kits and their more recent stuff is getting better and better. - AFV club makes some interesting kits, with some fit issues but overall very good kits.  - Revell Germany - they are improving every year with nice new detailed, and CHEAP releases - Kitty Hawk - another new Chinese company (so many of them these days...) that are making very nicely detailed model kits.  -Bronco I've built a few of their kits and they are pretty decent overall.   My most hated brand is Trumpeter / Hobby Boss (They're basically the same company, right?). I refuse to buy them anymore. Too many fit issues, piss-poor instructions riddled with errors, incorrect color charts, bad photo etch quality. They seem to flood the market with kits. They don't do enough research to get things right, and it shows. They just don't care, they want to release as many kits as possible as fast as possible to saturate the market.   I'm not saying that all of Trumpeter's kits are bad, but in my experience of building 10+ trumpeter kits, I've never had a good experience."

Also the boxing: Clear parts wrapped in foam material, plus a colored instruction sheet. Pretty neat.     I build other brands on a regular basis, most commonly Revell of Germany. This has two reasons: First, they are cheap. Second, in my stash are three Tomcats (new mold). I know their kit, the flaws and issues, so it works out for me. Other notable brands are Academy and Italeri (Italeri has some georgeous stuff, but also some crap in their line up). One positive to mention: Sword! I've not built their Banshee yet, but it's in my stash. Well detailed parts, comes with PE and resin parts, instructions are well made and colored. Obviously they cooperated with Eduard.    Brands I've felt negative about were Airfix and Heller, but mostly because the kits were old as hell. New Airfix kits are pretty decent. Oh, and Hobby Craft. Never-ever buy this: crap parts, no details, no accuracy, decals... well... calling that decals would be too much. Just... don't.    But after all: It's a model kit and what you make out of it counts the most. In my stash lays an old Airfix SH-2 Seasprite. We'll see how it is going, but I look at it as a challenge. It's going to turn out awesome, and that's not the kits' fault :D"

A zippo comes in quite handy if I need to, say, heat-weld rivets onto something or cut thick plastic easily. I've also been known to use it to make plastic weak, for example bending thickly molded fenders on tanks. I've got a hammer on hand, too, which most recently saw use hammering track pins in on my 1/16th T-34/85.  I've also experimented with non-standard tools that didn't quite work out. I was curious if my .177 pellet rifle could replicate large caliber tank shell impacts with actual impacts, so I took a crappy Panzer IV hull and used it for target practice. Discovered that the plastic used for model kits isn't really conducive to that. It does make for a good dent to simulate a non-penetrating hit when fired at low power, I'll admit, but any shot powerful enough to penetrate the plastic causes it to break more like glass than metal. Doesn't give a neat little penetration hole, just sort of shatters it. I might get better luck if I warmed the plastic up to 200 degrees, but eh, not gonna worry too much about it. A drill bit will do the job much easier."
modelmakers,3crodt,flounderflound,2,Fri Jul 10 06:13:49 2015 UTC,I cut a rectangular hole in a piece of paper and reinforced the outer corners with masking tape so I could spot-spray small sections of a mostly completed model without getting paint anywhere I don't want it.

The short answer is that that set is probably okay but you would be better off getting a compressor and one good airbrush than 3 low-quality airbrushes. Check out Badger and Iwata and Paasche at the $70-100 price point. Go for gravity feed double-action (that is, with a cup on top rather than a bottle on the bottom) and don't worry too much right now about getting a super-fine detail-painting tip. Drop $30-60 on a compressor and regulator/moisture trap (since those little hobby compressors are all pretty much identical-- the regulator is the important part. Get a compressor with a tank if you feel like spending more and worry about noise.) and use the rest of your budget on a good mid-to-high-range airbrush that you won't have to replace within six months."

However, you'll definitely want to use an airbrush to apply it, as the spray can just doesn't give enough control or accuracy. So the real question is is it safe to airbrush with, as it almost certainly works. And it shouldn't make contact with the plastic, as the paint would act as a buffer itself, so there's no need to worry about that either.  Hope it helps :D"

modelmakers,3cq1zc,windupmonkeys,1 point,Thu Jul 9 21:34:33 2015 UTC,"Thanks and ain't that the truth! so much brown, gray and green! Luckily I have the Badger Minitaire set that has.. well a lot more browns and greens! But it also has some reds and such as you can see on the top two shelves. This is about 1/2 my total paint collection.   I have a ton of Humbrol acryllics I'm going to try mixing with  future to see if they  work better on the suggestion of /u/windupmonkeys. And of course about ~50 more bottles of the badger Minitaire set that I just couldn't fit. When I get a paint booth I'm going t move this to the opposite wall next to the window so I can have easy access to the paint booth and add a second one of these racks since I'm starting to purchase the Mr. Color and Tamiya lines now.   Can never have enough paint, Especially brown!"
modelmakers,3cq1zc,BOB_9000,2,Thu Jul 9 21:55:51 2015 UTC,"I would use tamiya clear. That's the original formulation I used for the mix.  Future might work, but I can't remember testing it.   I know the tamiya mix provides predictable results. Future's natural gloss may prove problematic. On the other hand, its self levelling properties might  be useful.   The interesting thing is that if you mix the humbrol with tamiya clear, it's still strippable with the same solvent for both: 91% alcohol.   However, beware. If you mix 91% alcohol with humbrol acrylics, you will get a pile of useless gunk."
modelmakers,3cq1zc,windupmonkeys,1 point,Thu Jul 9 22:58:34 2015 UTC,"Oh ok, I guess I remembered your post wrong, I saved it for when I'm ready to try it, luckily I'm starting to buy Tamiya paints next since I have a good supply of the rest so I'll get some extra of their clear for the humbrol stuff. Thanks for the heads up! :-)"
modelmakers,3cq1zc,windupmonkeys,2,Thu Jul 9 23:13:10 2015 UTC,"Clear coat with paint? What is this sorcery? Does that negate the need for a clear finish in the end? Also I have to ask, what's the difference between standard artist's acrylics and the ones made by modeling companies?"
modelmakers,3cq1zc,BOB_9000,3,Fri Jul 10 00:06:27 2015 UTC,"/u/BOB_9000   No, they do not negate the need for a clear coat in the end.   /u/HandBanaba and I were talking about how to salvage his supply of Humbrol Acrylic paint, which I still think is one of the poorest performing acrylic paints I've ever used for models.   It coats poorly, has surface tension issues if you thin it with water, has poor adhesion, and is unpleasant to work with. It also requires an absolutely absurd amount of shaking (30 seconds, they recommend) before you can use it, every single time, because the pigment and carrier fluids separate if the paint is left alone for more than a few hours.   The way I got around the absolutely piss poor working properties of the Humbrol paint was by mixing 50% tamiya acrylic clear, with 50% of the bad humbrol acrylic paint.    Why did I do this? I needed some PRU Blue for a recon spitfire. I bought a tin of the humbrol acrylic paint, and discovered its ""excellent"" working properties.   The result was sprayable paint that could be passed through an airbrush with the Humbrol color I wanted, but with airbrushing qualities closer to Tamiya acrylic, which sprays quite well.   It does NOT negate the need for a clear coat. It simply was an experiment to make that crap paint more usable.   It worked, in my estimation.   Artist acrylics are super thick and come in toothpaste tubes, among other containers. It is not the same formulation as the stuff used in model paints, with few exceptions. They also don't react quite the same to thinners, and are designed for painting on canvases, not models.   Model companies to a certain extent also cater to colors that are more in the range of modelmakers (like RLM colors) and in some cases, have desirable working properties for modelmakers (e.g. easy to brush paint, for Model Master Acrylics, in my experience), easy to spray (Tamiya), or whatever.   The solvents across brands are not the same. Tamiya can be stripped and thinned with alcohol, while Vallejo cant (put alcohol in that paint and you'll get useless gunk)."
modelmakers,3cp39n,GeneralRose,2,Thu Jul 9 17:10:47 2015 UTC,"Well, this is usually a tricky question to answer.  I moved many times (internationally three times). Trust me, it's hard. I wanted to do what the pros do and get some foam and cut out outlines of the models so it could fit nice and snug... You know in the movies when there's a disassembled sniper rifle in a suitcase and there's padding around it.  Well, that's too expensive and too much work. I just wrapped them in news paper. If there were parts prone to breaking, then I would tape some packing peanuts around them. All came and non broke (minus a gear leg from a plane coming off, but that's my fault for gluing it badly).   Truth be told, there's no real easy way to do it. Wrap them in news paper. Thats probably the east way. Just make sure to pack them in a box correctly. Larger and heavier ones on the bottom. Lighter on top. Don't put heavy boxes on top of the model box."

Your application was perfect, really top notch, especially how you made them integrate with the panel lines. It's the size I don't like, don't they seem a bit too small?

modelmakers,3cizgb,BOB_9000,2,Wed Jul 8 14:34:00 2015 UTC,"Non-camouflage markings shrank and were often dulled by the Air Force during Vietnam. On the gunships, for instance (AC-47s, AC-119s, AC-130s), the practice of using nose art became frowned upon as the NVA learned to spot the plane in the night sky by spotting the brighter colors. Likewise the star and bar shrank similarly as well, as it increased the aircraft's visibility. This is part of why the USAF eventually just started doing gray insignias.  Also, the NVA didn't have a whole lot of planes in the air. The US had a huge amount of control of the skies - it was SAMs and AA that made the game scary for US pilots."
modelmakers,3cizgb,flounderflound,2,Wed Jul 8 15:35:09 2015 UTC,Very interesting info. You'd think that they'd do away with markings entirely if it was a detriment to the pilots.

Once that has dried I will be doing some dot filter streaking over the decks and hull. Once that's all done I'll seal everything up with a flat coat.   I used an eduard Z-39 upgrade set which provided some details as well ass the railings on the sides. My god, Eduard's railings are absolutely perfect and are quite durable too. In the last kit I built, Trumpeter's rails were not only incredibly fragile, but none of them were pre-cut or had the little bends in them to shape them around each part of the ship.

In a couple of hours, I had the cockpit assembled with Eduard pre-painted PE. In a couple of more hours, the aircraft was basically assembled and ready to paint. These Tamiya kits are just well engineered marvels.   Then, disaster struck. Yes, I know that everything about Alclad ii says that the subsurface needs to be as smooth and shiny as possible. But, I decided to see what it would do over Tamiya's fine white spray primer. The results? I used about half of a bottle of Alclad dura-aluminum and while it looked reasonable, it felt like very coarse sandpaper.  I took some 1500 grit and sanded it smooth. It felt like glass, so I reapplied another coat of Alclad ii duraluminum, and it covered great, with very little paint used.   Then, I highlighted some panels in either ""aluminum"" or ""dark aluminum"". I think, despite the initial ef up, it turned out reasonably well.  I learned my lesson. Next time I will certainly coat it in gloss black before I try to apply the alclad.   I am going to install copper tubing for the gun barrels, and I am  waiting on my decal sheet to arrive (probably tomorrow) before I mask off the wing/tail stripes, and paint on the anti glare panel on the nose.  http://imgur.com/a/2LRcY  Then, on to decals.

modelmakers,3cjx7o,Fortunate_0ne,4,Wed Jul 8 17:22:42 2015 UTC,"Probably yes. Tamiya's large scale kits are often just static kits of their RC tanks.   This one I don't recall being an RC tank though.   There's a second problem:   You have to equip this thing, with gearboxes, radio equipment, spend all the time to convert it to make sure everything works. There's a chance that it might not, because you don't know how the person who is selling it assembled it, whether they locked the axles, whether key parts have been removed that would make motorization easier.   So the question is, are you buying this because you think you're getting a discount on an RC tank, or because you want this particular model, want to work on its display properties, while incidentally having fun with making it work, but being okay with that if it doesn't work that well?   If you think you're saving money, you probably aren't. For that kind of money, you can buy a ready made 1/16 tank and some upgrade parts. Best case, you buy a bunch of parts off a shelf that was meant to go into the 1/16 tank that was ready to run and for which spares are available.   If you're okay with tinkering and making this work? Then yeah, it might be worth it for you. If you know what you're doing, then you might even get the best of both: a tamiya quality tank with cheap 1/16 tank guts, for a discount on what one of these things cost new, which I think is way overpriced for what you get.   Radios are cheap these days, after all. A six channel system goes for about 50 dollars if you go with a Chinese-made 2.4 ghz radio., servos cost 5-10 dollars per unit, and you'll need gearbox and batteries.   The problem is that without being able to inspect how the running gear is assembled or whether it can be mounted to drive shafts for the gearbox, it's a shaky proposition."

I was just a guy building model cars and got hooked up with a commercial photographer that needed some weird things built for computer software boxart and print ads. He happened to be talking to the Art Dept. head at Will Vinton Studios ( here in Portland, Oregon ) and mentioned me. WVS needed some new blood and called me up. I started off low man on the totem pole. I loved every single day there. Learning and getting paid. I made props on the side for local movie productions and friends films. WVS was mainly a stop-motion facility but we did some live action stuff as well. I became a pretty good model maker. The issue has always been computers. CGI and practical models are always fighting for supremacy. So my job has been a roller coaster of employment due to me NOT wanting to leave Portland. Now it's the 3-D Printer that has pretty much sealed the deal. The puppets that were made for Paranorman came out of the printer COMPLETELY finished. That took away jobs in the fallowing departments: sculpting/character fabrication, mold making, casting, model maker/clean up, paint. Ouch. I have old WVS pals that worked on Robot Chicken, HBO productions, big budget films up in Vanc. BC, Star Wars, toy companies....etc. You just have to have some talent.

They didn't really get all that beat up lookin' so don't overdo the weathering. Most of what clung to Shermans was bits of the German and French countryside. Mud is going to be the primary bit of weathering present on the tank, you may also have random bits of hedgerows stuck in some parts of the suspension."
modelmakers,3ck33q,MrBlankenshipESQ,1 point,Thu Jul 9 03:22:23 2015 UTC,"True, true. Be careful if you decide to go for the mud, it isn't easy to make mud look, well muddy. Ask around, look up some tutorials, as it's really easy to end up with flat looking pasty stuff. I've come up with a method that sort of works. It's not the best by far, but I think it scrapes the bottom of acceptable. If anyone's interested let me know :D"
modelmakers,3ck33q,BOB_9000,4,Thu Jul 9 16:13:34 2015 UTC,"Can't go wrong with chipping and rust streaks. Also, greasy boot marks around the engine hatches and oil leaks. A rusty exhaust never looks out of place, even if the sherman's pipes are small and out of the way, that extra bit of colour will make it stand out a bit more. Rub the side of a pencil along edges to give a worn shiny metal look (definitely do this on the tracks as well, on the places where they make contact with the ground). Maybe add a rust coloured dot filter to the top facing surfaces of your tank as well. If you're unsure of how to do any of this, I'll be glad to explain my methods. Best of luck, and let us see how it turns out! EDIT: someone's really taken a dislike to my presence on this sub :D"
modelmakers,3ck33q,BOB_9000,3,Wed Jul 8 17:17:52 2015 UTC,"Chipping and rust streaks actually are two things that are very commonly overdone.  Rust is not something that typically shows up on a tank that is well maintained, save for the exhaust.  Chipping does happen, but unless it is applied carefully and in logical locations it can look cartoonish and overdone.  Best advice I can give is to spend some time carefully studying photographs too see what kind of weathering took place and how it looked.  Note:  If someone has taken a dislike to you it isn't me.  Just offering my thoughts."
modelmakers,3ck33q,Aiglos_and_Narsil,1 point,Thu Jul 9 03:36:58 2015 UTC,"Actually, yes, you're right, there's certain situations where it does work really well, but a Sherman in working condition may not be one of them. It really comes down to personal preference methinks, I tend to go overboard (not quite over the top, IMO, but somewhere around that threshold) to compensate for the lack of dust and mud, which every time I've tried doing has always looked flat. I guess you could say I've sacrificed historical accuracy for a different aesthetic style. But yes you're also right that it can be used on every model if used in either places that nobody really touches, like rust streaking down form the exhaust, or places that are constantly grabbed or manipulated, like ladders and such. Basically, you have to decide how accurate you want your machine to be, before really doing anything else."
modelmakers,3ck33q,BOB_9000,2,Thu Jul 9 16:09:07 2015 UTC,"I'd avoid heavy chipping/rusting and i'd focus on tone variation and dust/rainmarks on the paint.  This is my Sherman Firefly (please don't look at the tracks ._.), i used a mix of preshading and different tones of green to add some variety to the paint, then i added the ""dust"" by placing small dots of dust color enamel (you can use oils) and ""smearing"" (not streaking) the dots with a brush damped in thinner"

modelmakers,3cgoiw,MrCinical,4,Tue Jul 7 20:14:42 2015 UTC,"Your problem is that you love models so much that you gotta see them finished RIGHT NOW! You're not retarded. You're just too eager. Pipe it down. Take a deep breath. Measure twice and cut once. Triple check stuff. Check the instructions, then look at you tube videos, then go to wikipedia, then ask in a forum and then call that uncle you haven't seen in years and ask him if it's ok before you cut out the first part. I'm restarting after decades away and it's taken me since this winter to finish a 1/144 Concorde which is the stupidly simplest built but that bitch is looking tight."

modelmakers,3cgoiw,Ashenfenix,6,Tue Jul 7 20:02:53 2015 UTC,"First model: completely disregarded instructions, assembled cockpit and fuselage, didn't fit together.  That's not clumsiness.   Neither is this:  Third model: Helicopter. Broke the rotors, applied decals before painting. Didn't paint.  Are you rushing through your builds? Test fit, test fit, and test fit some more. If it doesn't fit, figure out why. Fixing something you already glued is a lot harder than getting it to fit properly in the first place.   As for your Osprey, this is why filler and sandpaper was invented; it's probably not as bad as you think unless you left glue fingerprints all over your model.   Bent needles:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpfGdCOd6aY  And before you conclude that you bent the needle, try cleaning your airbrush by stripping the nozzle head and removing the needle. Splatter can also be caused by dried paint in the front end of the airbrush, paint in channel where the needle goes through, and so on.   Fourth model: B-17. Did O.K. job putting it together, lousy, unfinished job painting. (I might remove the paint and foil it instead).  Depending on the paint, that is strippable, but you'll lose the decals along with it if you already applied them."
modelmakers,3cgoiw,windupmonkeys,2,Tue Jul 7 20:03:57 2015 UTC,"Also it sounds like you need to slow down, be more patient, and work on the fundamentals.

Better yet, find one in say, a magazine of a basic level build (without heavy weathering, etc, etc) and then just build that in sequence with the magazine.   Clumsy? No. Stupid? Probably not.

modelmakers,3cgoiw,windupmonkeys,2,Tue Jul 7 23:23:23 2015 UTC,"What paint are you using.   Certain types of paints have tip dry problems, causing that kind of spatter. If you start seeing spatter, look at the front end of your airbrush. There might be a glob of paint in the nozzle area, which will cause spatter.   You can use a q-tip and some thinner to alleviate the problem temporarily, but after that session you need to break down and clean the front end of your airbrush. That problem is only going to get worse."

modelmakers,3cgoiw,TheSumoWrestler,2,Tue Jul 7 23:18:28 2015 UTC,"First off realize that we all started somewhere, and we all make mistakes. The key is to learn from them.  It sounds like, as others have suggested, that you're just rushing things, excited to see the finished product.  The biggest difference between the quality of a kit built by you, and the best among us, is likely just patience, and experience (and having the right tools and supplies makes a big difference as well). Beyond that, there is no secret formula.   My suggestion would be to start a new kit or two. Force yourself to follow the instructions to the letter. After a few kits, you'll begin to get a feel for how you can rearrange things to maximize your time and potential. Watch lots of YouTube videos. Ask lots of questions. And, most of all, enjoy yourself. You'll see your quality improve over time. In fact, looking back over my model building life, I can recognize places where my skills seemed to take a huge jump in a short period. Sometimes things just click and you get a feel for a certain part of the craft, and the timing.   Hang in there."

While creating a few boot-stains in the access area of the left hand cockpit side, for which I use a sharpened black crayon normally, I grabbed a purple one. I noticed too late, so now obviously the crew wore purple-soled boots. Any idea how to get them off? Picture here.    Second, and major, screw up concerns my F-111B project. For some parts and a few decals I got me the old Revell F-111, made in 1967. The decalsheet was in good condition, regarding its age of 48 years. There was some yellowing of the carrier film, so I placed the decals on the windowsill for some time. After three weeks: success! But here it comes. I left them there to improve the result a bit more. On sunday, a warm and hot day, a thunderstrom was coming up. I, fooling around with my camera, hoping to get some pictures of lightnings, forgot the window was still tilted. Long story short: the storm started with such power that rain and hail came through, flooding the windowsill. I noticed just a minute later what happened and rescued the F-111B decals (and some similar-aged F4U decals).    Well, they have dried by now, but still, that was unnecessary as hell."

This is the Platz Anglerfish Team Pz IV Ausf D, which is really a rebox of the Dragon 3-in-1 kit with some stuff removed and DS tracks substituted for Magic Tracks (I just bought Friuls, the DS tracks were for a late-war Pz IV anyway).   Build was a lot of fun--like most earlier Dragon stuff it was very detailed (even without the additional parts--I can only imagine what Dragon supplied originally, since even on this the drive sprocket housings had individual separate bolts that I had to glue on!) and fit pretty well, although Dragon is the King of Parts That Almost-But-Don't-Quite Fit Perfectly. Color modulation was done on a primer coat of black, with Tamiya Field Blue as the base coat, Medium Blue as the mid tone, and Light Blue as the highlight--Anglerfish Team's vehicle is rather blue, so I thought a brighter, bluey Panzer Grey mix would be best. Oarai's Automotive Club in the show maintains the Senshado Team's vehicles with love and care, so I kept weathering to a minimum, some chipping, rusting, and streaking. Most of Oarai's matches for some reason take place in areas that would kick up dust, but aren't very muddy--in particular I wanted to model this particular version of their tank at the end of its service life as a D (it gets upgraded to an F2 later), so I figured this would be after the battle against Anzio, which takes place in an Italy-like dusty environment.

modelmakers,3ccf9w,koffeeknight,4,Mon Jul 6 22:29:58 2015 UTC,"Panzer Vor indeed!   I kept weathering light for the reasons I gave. First I did color modulation, spraying in gradients with panel lines and stuff masked off--this doesn't sound like it's weathering, but it sort of is, since it simulates light hitting the vehicle at different angles and can also replicate faded paint. It looks kinda stark when at first goes on, so I did an oil dot filter with brown, yellow, green, white, and blue colors (I actually put a little too much blue on, should used more brown). Before that I put on AK-Interactive's blue wash for Panzer Grey, pretty lightly (mostly light pin washes). Chipping was done with Tamiya Light Blue and German Grey--the German Grey looks like worn metal, and the Light Blue looks like worn paint. I liked the effect of having two different colors of paint chips, I'd never tried that before--I also added steel into a few chips here and there, to replicate new wear down to the metal, and did some scratches along with the chips. Streaking was done with AK-Interactive's Panzer Grey streaking grime, and Burnt Umber oil paint for the rust streaks. I also dry brushed on a little Tamiya Weathering Master Rust on occasional hatches, especially in thr back. Speaking of the back, I put a lot of Florymodel grime wash on back there on the engine deck and rear plate, although you can't see it at all--I'll have to find some way to make it visible in the future. The dust wash was the fun part--AK-Interactive's Dust Effects are a lot of fun to use, just spray it on at low pressure and then use white spirit to take it off, leaving behind rain streaks and a more realistic finish. Plus some Tamiya Weathering Master Light Sand (applied mostly wet to the lower hull and lightly dry brushed on the upper hill, especially around the AK dust--also I used the airbrush to splatter some on the lower hull and rear plate) and viola. That's more or less it, there were a few minor things in there and I tested the tracks differently, but that's thr gist of it. Lotta work for a ""lightly weathered"" vehicle :/"

modelmakers,3ce43q,Fortunate_0ne,2,Tue Jul 7 05:02:34 2015 UTC,"This is my first time using Alclad II paints for anything larger than drop tanks. The base coat is ""dura-aluminum"", with some panels highlighted in the lighter ""aluminum"", and darker ""dark aluminum"".   That was a steep learning curve. The first coat had to be totally sanded off and reapplied as it was terribly grainy.   Now, for my questions. First, decals. I've read where some people suggest putting the decals directly on top of the alclad, with no future or any sort of sealant. Suggestions?  Second, pin washing. I have oil based artist paint and pure gum spirits turpentine. Does that harm the alclad, or after I apply decals do I need to put some sort of clear coat on top before I pin wash?  All thoughts, suggestions, hints, critiques are appreciated."
modelmakers,3ce43q,BOB_9000,2,Tue Jul 7 05:08:20 2015 UTC,It's universally okay to apply decals to a surface if it's very smooth and shiny. There's probably a few exceptions but this likely isn't one of them.
modelmakers,3ce43q,frugm1,1 point,Tue Jul 7 21:25:27 2015 UTC,"Well a couple of things to bare in mind, using a clear coat with alclad's will more than likely mar the metallic finish just slightly. Also the alclad's website recommends that you don't use any setting solutions for decals WITHOUT using a clear coat first.   Using turps to thin oils without an acrylic clear coat, could end in tears. The surface would probably be smooth enough without a clear coat to get capillary action going, but I'd be worried about the turps stripping the paint off even after a good drying time  To be honest I'd give it a clear coat.  Edit: from what I've read it depends with setting solution you use. Microsol should be fine right over the top of alclad, solvaset is a lot stronger so tends to have a greater chance of ruining the surface. Either way I'd let the paint cure completely 3/4 days before touching it."
modelmakers,3cak3o,LOLtheism,3,Mon Jul 6 11:54:58 2015 UTC,"This was my first groupbuild, and it was a blast. Here's a WIP album I'll reference. I chose a more modern Tamiya kit since most of the armor I've built of that brand were re-issues of older kits. The entire thing required almost no filler, and everything fit together perfectly.  This was my first attempt pre-shading, and I definitely did it wrong. My nozzle for the airbrush apparently had a crack in it, which led to quite a bit of splatter, and I didn't color modulate to bring out the full effect.  I learned an important lesson: double-check everything you try for the first time. I wanted to use Future floor polish as a binding surface for my decals. Instead, I used an almost identical bottle of Pledge and accidentally thought it said ""Future"" instead of ""Finish"". Now I have glossy, dark patches on the model where they don't belong.  Next time, I'll also try to get different pigments for the mud instead of just using one. I tried to go for an uneven effect, like one or tires got stuck in the mud, but it doesn't look right. I'll also start priming in black for color modulation, and start washing my models as well.  This was a great time, thanks /u/Plundersquirrel for organizing it, I was happy to be a part of it."
modelmakers,3cak3o,Plundersquirrel,2,Mon Jul 6 12:07:01 2015 UTC,"Not a problem ;)  Looks good, congrats."
modelmakers,3cak3o,alaskafish,2,Mon Jul 6 14:42:37 2015 UTC,"Nice kit. I am a fan of the 232.   As for pre shading try my style of preshading. Instead of priming the model a light color like a grey, prime in black. Then, with the base color, spray the inverse of the preshade. So instead of painting the sides of panels, paint the middle without touching the edge. Then, lightly go over the model with the same base color to finish the color...  The future finish stuff confused me. What do you mean you thought it was future instead of finish? They both should work to be honest. And they aren't something to bind the decals. They make the surface smoother and easier to slide the decals into position.    Other than that, it's pretty good. I personally believe you went over board with mud, but that's just me.... I'm not much a fan of muddy vehicles unless they're on a diorama. The uneven effect would have worked much better if the diorama was there to support a story.  The model could use other types of weathering. Things like a wash and some streaking effects. Buff color to simulate dust."
modelmakers,3cak3o,alaskafish,1 point,Mon Jul 6 14:15:13 2015 UTC,"I picked up some Alclad Laquer Black Primer, and I'm going to start airbrushing with that instead.  I meant that I used the wrong floor finish, it said ""Finish"" in big letters rather than ""Future"". I was really tired, and didn't bother to check before applying it. Yes, I meant I was using it as a better surface for the decals to stick to.  Thanks for the feedback! Any good links for ways to get the streaking / buff effects? I think next time I might try some salt chipping on the edges."
modelmakers,3cak3o,flounderflound,2,Mon Jul 6 14:21:07 2015 UTC,"I'm on mobile. But check out either Vallejo or tamiya buff colors. As for streaking, you can do it your self by painting a small dab of paint over the varnish. Then with what ever dilutes that paint, streak it. There's tutorials on it. But if you rather just buy it, then MiG interactive or ak."

Hanging storage for rifles, bags, sacks, ammo, etc. You could pile a lot of stuff up on it. Camo application for concealment from aircraft / armor. It gives the vehicle an awkward profile which is useful, and covering it in foliage would confuse aircraft. Don't know if this was an intended use, but it would've been greatly helpful."

modelmakers,3cat9x,sophiaross,4,Mon Jul 6 13:31:42 2015 UTC,"What I like to do is assemble the larger sections then paint and weather after.   I'd normally glue the hull and decks together, then paint them their respective colours. Id suggest invesing in some good putty to fill the seams of the hull and decks. After that it's just lots of mini models like the super structure, guns, life boats, seaplanes  and the like.   One thing you should check out is pontos wooden decks. They really make a world of difference and they go on like a charm. No worrying that you'll mess up the deck by panting it.   I'd also recommend some photo etch sets. If it's your first ship model maybe just go with a set of railings because even they make an amazing difference!   As for painting, pretty straight forward on ships. Follow the instructions camo  schemes or do some research if they aren't perfect. You can also pre shade some areas with black paint before the  actual paint coat just to get some details to pop.  If you're going for a heavy weathering effect you can spray random lines of brown green and black all over the parts before the final colour and it gives it a really nice old beaten and battered look.   Just take your time and don't rush! I've built 6 1/350th ship models now and I keep getting better! :)"
modelmakers,3cat9x,Yssom14,2,Mon Jul 6 13:53:30 2015 UTC,"Thanks! I just have a few questions. First off, with wooden decks, do I just cut them out with an exacto like I would balsa wood? Or do I need a special tool? Second, for the photo etch railings, how do you recommend I bend them to fit the shape of the hull? and lastly, if I do go with the plastic decks, how would I paint and weather them to look real?"
modelmakers,3cat9x,Yssom14,3,Mon Jul 6 14:05:38 2015 UTC,"The pontos decks are all laser engraved and pre-cut, just peel and stick! Some little pieces might stay in place but I just poke them out with an exacto knife.  For the railings I invested in a hold and fold, basically a clamp with many different width clamps that hold the etch as you bend it with a razor blade, I've also had success by using long needle nose pliers holding the railing then just bending it with my fingers.  For weathering the deck there's a couple options. You can pre shade with darker colors and apply a wash after, or you can paint then cut out plank length pieces of masking tape and lay them on the plastic deck then gradually build up paint layers alternating with darker and lighter so you get a really nice light and dark effect to the wood. I've never done that one as it seems too complex for me, but I have had some success in earlier models by painting then just applying a dark ish wash to various areas.  One thing with painting tamiya decks is they tend to have a lot of molded on pieces be it vents or break waters or deck boxes. You just need a steady hand to paint them after you paint the deck! :)"

modelmakers,3cayvs,HeckleMagpie,3,Mon Jul 6 14:22:40 2015 UTC,"Rust will be your friend with the exhaust. Think about how the exhaust of a >10 year old passenger car looks, then figure a T-34 sees more abuse and neglect in one month than that car will ever see, and you'll get an idea of how rotten the sheet metal exhaust tips will be. Might even be worth omitting one entirely, reasoning it just fell off due to rusting so severely, and they should definitely be very heavily pitted/chipped/nicked. And no, I don't mean the paint, I mean the plastic itself.  As for the grills on the engine deck...beyond the usual grit coating the whole tank there won't be much to do there. There may be a few bent rungs from conscripts clinging to the tank, a common practice in the Red Army at the time, but that's really about it. As already mentioned the only things going through those vents are air and whatever smoke is in the air. You might could soot up the vent at the rearmost portion of the engine deck, as this is where the hot air is vented out after having cooled the engine. That would simulate a catastrophic engine failure at some point in the tank's life, which T-34s were prone to in part because a lack of maintenance and in part because of how rushed the engines were on the assembly lines."
modelmakers,3cayvs,MrBlankenshipESQ,2,Tue Jul 7 15:09:19 2015 UTC,"Grills on tanks usually protect radiators, not exhaust pipes. I'd suggest to dry brush a lighter/darker shade of the hull color just to highlight the areas and nothing more. There is not enough heat to cook the paint in those areas   Regarding exhaust, X-10 + XF-10 as a base, then some rust pigments if you want. Oil leaks / non perfect engine tunings were common on T34s (they actually spit flakes of aluminum from the engine for the first 400(IIRC) Km because the engine was not perfectly machined, you can imagine how much oil they spitted), some trace of oil under the exhaust is a nice addition"

The size might be right for a 1/72."
modelmakers,3cb78z,windupmonkeys,1 point,Tue Jul 7 13:24:34 2015 UTC,"That's a fantastic idea. I'd bet they'd be just about right. I wonder if I can find vacuforms or something.  And you know I now want to see pictures of your C-47, right? Because that sounds awesome."

modelmakers,3cb78z,frugm1,1 point,Tue Jul 7 16:28:04 2015 UTC,Any suggestions for where to look? I can't say I've ever bought anything from squadron before.
modelmakers,3cb78z,frugm1,2,Tue Jul 7 19:40:36 2015 UTC,"1001modelkits might have something, as will Ebay (they sell NIB things like everyone else on there). You can also just type it into Google."
modelmakers,3c8i8h,zbouzaiene,5,Sun Jul 5 22:05:12 2015 UTC,"An entire list of paint required is listed on the side of the box, in the instructions, or on the company website. Some of those colors, however, might be redundant. If the box offers two different color schemes for the bike, for example, then tamiya lists the colors needed to paint BOTH bikes, for example. You need to look at the instructions and the backpage that shows how the model is painted overall to get a better idea if it's just a single bike (and that those are all the colors you need) or if that's paints designed to color two differently colored bikes.   The colors listed include things for the exhaust systems, the wheels, various small details.   http://www.tamiya.com/english/products/14129/index.htm  Tamiya spray cans will work for things like the bodywork and some large components, but not really for the small ones. In point of fact, they LIST the call numbers for the paints.   TS-6 Matt Black 85006 TS-8 Italian Red    85008 TS-30 Silver Leaf   85030 TS-34 Camel Yellow  85034 TS-83 Metallic Silver   85083  These look like they are for the bodywork, and possibly the engine (metallic silver).   Hard. A motorcycle kit as your first model will be difficult to make it look the same as the one on the box or the demo you see there. It'll take many hours. For experienced builders, depending on how fast they're working 20-30 hours, for a new builder, that's open to how quick you learn, and how good of a job you want to do.   Statistically speaking, if this is your first model, I would lower your expectations. While some people do a very good model on their first try, most people do not.   For the bodywork, yes, I'd recommend a spray can. Also, tamiya paints do not get along with paintbrushes well, so you're better off using another brand. Most people who use tamiya paints spray them, or brush paint only very small areas.   One type of paint that would be particularly good for brushing is model master acrylic, which is very easy to use and cleans up with water. However, it also requires a ""primer"" coat"" or a tamiya spray layer underneath it, because the paint doesn't stick to bare plastic very well.  You don't just need paint. You need glue, an x-acto knife, and some way to cleanly remove the parts from the parts trees (the knife is the minimum you need for that). You will also need superglue for the ""metal transfers"" which I assume means photoetched metal parts, which don't glue via normal plastic cement.   While you might be temped to use a toothpaste tube-like cement for this model, don't. Use something like this:   http://www.amazon.com/Tamiya-87038-Extra-Thin-Cement/dp/B000BMYWYC  This is a somewhat ""enthusiastic"" review of a similar kit to yours, if not the identical one (I'm sure Tamiya makes more than one ducati) http://modelingmadness.com/review/cars/barrattducati.htm  Various other reviews are available here, or build threads of people who built a similar bike: some of these seem to be the work of more advanced builders.  http://www.ipmskalamazoo.org/builds/tamiya-ducati-916-motorcycle/ http://www.modelersalliance.com/spruepub-forum/shelf-queen-ii/148825-tamiya-1-12-ducati-916  Here is a primer for how to build plastic models. I would pay particular attention to the section about brush painting, and the section about glues. I would also pay attention to the part about removing parts. You can use a knife instead of a sprue cutter. Beginners often twist the parts off the parts trees. That usually will damage more delicate parts, and even if it doesn't, it'll leave a nasty gash on where the attachment point was.   http://www.finescale.com/~/media/Files/PDF/How%20To/EasyScaleModeling.pdf  This is a tutorial on how to get a shiny paintjob on car bodies, which applies to your motorcycle model because of the same principles that would be applied using a can of spray paint.   http://italianhorses.net/Tutorials/PerfectPaint/paint.htm  That said, while a lot of this seems negative, it's not. I wish you best of luck on your first model, and I hope that it goes well, you enjoy it, and that you enjoy it enough to keep doing it. However, the process is not really that quick, and there is a learning curve involved."
modelmakers,3c8i8h,windupmonkeys,2,Sun Jul 5 22:11:24 2015 UTC,"Phew, this looks like a lot of work, I think I may start on something a bit easier and do the Ducati when I gain more experience.

modelmakers,3c8i8h,windupmonkeys,3,Sun Jul 5 22:30:36 2015 UTC,"That's even harder. While the construction itself won't be as hard, applying all those decals would be difficult. It requires a lot of precise masking work, the ability to work very well with a ton of decals...not a good first choice at all.   Here's a primer on building your first car model from one of the magazines in the area:  http://www.scaleautomag.com/how-to-models/how-to/2008/12/getting-started-in-the-hobby  If you insist on starting with a car, try something simpler. No race cars, just a plain, simple car.   Something like this might work:   http://www.revell.de/en/products/model-building/cars/modern-cars/id/07094.html  Why:   Lots of large, solid colors and not a lot of decal work to do compared to that Porsche you just sent a link to.   The American kit (same plastic, different instructions) is pretty simple. Read the instructions and see if you think that's too much work. Mind, this is a comparatively simple car kit for someone  of mid-beginner/early intermediate skill.   The same links I sent about painting bodies with a spray can would apply here, if you want it to look shiny like a real car.   http://www.amazon.com/Revell-24-Audi-R8-Spyder/dp/B0076BMSQ0  The problem is, most car kits are comparatively complicated as a first time kit. They can have engines, exhaust headers, crankcases, detailed interior painting, etc.   What you want is a car that has very simple paintwork. Like an all black interior, or a one color body. You can learn how to paint detail work with a brush by detailing the engine."

modelmakers,3c8i8h,windupmonkeys,3,Sun Jul 5 22:49:50 2015 UTC,"That's probably a better idea. Look up reviews of both kits and check scalemates.com to see how they assemble.   I suspect it'll be a close call. Tamiya kits generally fit very well. Good luck. Some car kits are what are called ""curbside"" kits, meaning they don't have engines and are just the body and any chassis details (like the underside). I would probably recommend that as a first time effort, but if you want to try your hand at learning how to brush paint effectively, I'd also consider getting a car with an engine. Worst case you can just glue the hood shut."
modelmakers,3c8i8h,windupmonkeys,1 point,Sun Jul 5 23:04:57 2015 UTC,"At the same time, this one also requires a lot of colors, but that will really depend on how detailed you want to make it and if you paint an engine.   http://www.tamiyausa.com/items/plastic-model-series-20/1-24-scale-sports-car-8000/toyota-supra-kit-24123  This is a build of the supra you described.

modelmakers,3c8i8h,windupmonkeys,2,Sun Jul 5 23:13:13 2015 UTC,"Finally, I am not a regular car builder. There is a subreddit that covers cars in particular here, listed on the sidebar. There is also a thread of a new person asking about what they need to get started. I'd read through it.   https://www.reddit.com/r/ModelCars/comments/3beh9f/getting_started/  The only car I've built in the last two years is this one:   https://www.reddit.com/r/modelmakers/comments/29xykg/ac_cobra_test_fitting_of_final_assembly_and_some/  As I don't specialize in cars, I'm sure the guys in /r/modelcars would laugh at the build or find things to nitpick. However, I wasn't trying that hard and it was when I was busy, so I put in less effort for fit and finish than I normally would.   However, I did use that italianhorses.net tutorial about painting bodies and his polishing process. There, I used toothpaste instead of polishing wax, and overcoated the final product with Future Floor Wax, a kind of floor finishing plastic that you can get in hardware stores if you're in the US.   I think that cobra kit is also fairly easy, if you're not building the engine. It's also quite cheap to buy, but it does have a few fit problems here and there. Hope this helps."

Dip your clear parts in it and let them dry, you'll notice a huge difference in how they look. Its also good as a clear coat and can work as a mild decal setting solution, speaking of which, Micro Sol, if you're doing a kit with a lot of decalling pick this up, basically melts the decal snugging it down around details and makes it look painted on.

modelmakers,3c4bpr,Plundersquirrel,3,Sat Jul 4 17:25:58 2015 UTC,"Hi guys,  As the title states, this is my Diorama submission to the Eastern Front Groupbuild. This is my first diorama, first time painting figures, and first time building any bigger than 1/72 scale.  I really enjoyed making this, and learnt a lot from it. I'll list the mistakes I made: I didn't glue the barrel very well, I didn't paint the small pieces (e.g. shovels) off the tank, the flat matt coat I did (maybe due to my thinning with water) left a white on all the tings I sprayed it with. I also need to find a better way of incorporating the soldiers' bases into the model. I'm going to put a wooden frame around it too so you can't see the polystyrene.  Please feel free to point out any other mistakes.  Also thanks to the following people who listened to and helped me with my many questions: /u/fjahja /u/Gewehr43 /u/solipsistnation Thanks."
modelmakers,3c4bpr,alaskafish,1 point,Sat Jul 4 17:26:02 2015 UTC,"It's pretty decent, but room for improvement.   Firstly I'm not much a fan of that fuzz grass... Especially in 1/35 scale. It's too short. I much prefer static grass, and most people do.   The tank is painted excellently. The figures however lack depth. I suggest you paint highlights. Basically with a lighter color, paint it in the area that light hits. Another option is to put a wash on the figures to break up the even color and also give them depth.   The tank needs a matt coat. It's too shiny. Maybe you did, but another would help. Never thin a Matt coat either.  Never.   Next time paint the tools. Usyally te tanks were painted with the tools on, but it looks a lot nicer, especially on larger scales if you just paint it on.   The figures, the grey is a bit too light. It's more of a dark color, especially the helmets.   The tank could use a it more weathering especially on the tracks. It needs to blend into the muddy road a bit more"
modelmakers,3c4bpr,alaskafish,2,Sat Jul 4 17:49:00 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the recommendations.  What would you recommend for the grass?  With the matt coat, it's Winsor and Newton Acrylic Matt Varnish, and I'm pretty sure it wouldn't spray if I didn't thin it, but I'll double-check.  I'll use a darker colour on the figures next time then.  With the weathering, I was really looking forward to making this model, and didn't want to ruin it with bad weathering, so I'm going to try some weathering out on models that are less important to me."
modelmakers,3c4bpr,BOB_9000,2,Sat Jul 4 18:25:37 2015 UTC,"As for brass, I recommend Gale Force 9's static grass. All though you do need to either buy or get an applicator if you want the proper effect. Making one is cheap and worth it if you ask me.  I'd just buy a model Matt coat varnish. It should pass through the airbrush and there should be no problems.  I'm not saying to use darker colors for the figures. You have a great base coat. The thing is that there is not much depth in the facial features. It's called artificial lighting. You mix white into the skin tone to get a lighter version of the color, and paint that on areas that would receive sunlight. Then mix the same base color for the skin with some black (I do brown) to darken it and paint that in areas on the face the figure's face would cast shadows. Basically you paint a lighter color on extrusions on the face and dark colors in the crevices. Now, I specifically do 1/72, so I'm not the best person for details of artificial lighting. I usually grab a brown wash and slather it on my figures (check out my last post for my soviet snipers from zvezda if you want an idea to what I do). If I had 35 scale figures, I'd probably just dry brush the lighter color so it only touches the extrusions then slather a wash for the crevices.  And you're absolutely right about weathering. Weathering can really be hit or miss. So I absolutely endorse that you try on some less models, because you really nailed it on the head with that tiger... Absolutely great paint job.  Watch some diorama tutorials online for some ideas. The more you watch, the more you learn, and the more you will be prepared making your next dioramas; not saying you weren't for this mind you.

modelmakers,3c4bpr,BOB_9000,1 point,Sun Jul 5 08:33:31 2015 UTC,"I definitely agree with most of what alaskafish suggested, do these and you'll see a massive improvement. There are two things I do disagree with. Firstly, the matte coat, I think it's got that perfect level of shine as it is. If you look at a real tiger, even if this one is well kept and clean  is you can still see that fundamental level of shine, it's very slight, but it looks like you nailed it. The second one, maybe I'm just a blind fool, but aren't the tools already painted? Apart from that, I'm 100% with everything he said.  There's also a few things I'd like to suggest as well. Firstly, I assume you used rubber tracks. Try to push them down and glue them in place, so that they look like they're resting on the rollers. Apart from that, the tiger weighs 54  tonnes, so you'd imagine the tracks it'd leave in dirt. This'll be rather hard to achieve for you though, as it looks like your detailed surface is just a sheet, with foam underneath. I have no idea how you'd make this work, but if you find a way it'd give your diorama that extra bit of realism."

modelmakers,3c5ug3,darkrift5,1 point,Sun Jul 5 02:56:32 2015 UTC,"Don't forget eBay. I usually check there before buying them from what you suggested. Sometimes you'll find exactly what you're looking for cheaper... And it's usually the case.  On Amazon a single paint costs around 5 bucks, yet I can find the exact paint for 3 bucks. Same with model kits; they're usually much cheaper.   Sometimes you'll find some people who have no idea what they're selling. I snagged an academy 1/72 B29 for $10. And a lot of dragon kits for $15 (4 kits).   Although the same could be said that you'll find some people who think they're worth a lot more than they should. I've seen someone selling 5 1/72 tanks, poorly built and some not even painted for $230 plus $30 shipping... I contacted the seller saying that they weren't worth that much and he responded to me saying they were created my an expert modeler (and refused to give a name). Other times I've seen Heller kits going for 60 bucks...  eBay is safe too. I haven't been ripped off, and in fact I have been able to refund and cancel my purchases whenever. Most of the sellers are actually official shops... Usually physical hobby shops. You know, Hobbytown USA, or your locally owned shop.   Check eBay before buying to see if the kit is cheaper. If not go to one of the above.  Don't forget Megahobby and DragonUSA. They sometimes got great deals, and are great for buying in bulk,"

Scalehobbyist.com also has some good deals and can sometimes help you find a rare kit or two. Pricing I've found to be either average or a good deal depending on the kit, etc.  Spruebothers as mentioned, I've honestly spent the most money with these guys and they are always fast and Customer service has been great.  Oh and for Sci-fi and really neat one off stuff like decals and little metal bits to add to your kit like rivets, and all sorts of crazy suff check out HobbySearch The shpping is a bit pricey since it's from Japan (Same as HLJ) and they are somewhat slow on processing orders but they are dependable and have some really rare and unique items you might not even know you'd want/need.   Also see: Squadron, Amazon, megahobby, etc, etc. Even Ebay can have some great deals.  One sour note for me.. http://www.hobbylinc.com/.. I've tried three times to get an order corrected. It was shipped to the wrong address due to how thier system pulls the address from paypal AFTER you enter your correct shipping address. they blame paypal and refuse to help. I lived close enough to dirve to where it should have been delivered but the item wasn't there, someone had stolen it off the porch and no one was living at the place. I called them back, said it never arrived and wanted to make an insurance claim. They said sure, said it would be 1-2 weeks, I waited, nothing, called them back and they said it was too late to do anything and I was SOL.. Not a particularly shining example of customer service. If you're careful though and triple check that thier system doesn't randomly change your address without warning they seemed to ship quickly and have decent enough prices and carried some hard to find items."
modelmakers,3c34fq,Pat_Mann,2,Sat Jul 4 08:26:10 2015 UTC,"Nice start and welcome to the hobby!   Some notes un no particular order:   Next time try to paint the canopy, it will enhance a lot the aspect of the model: you can use a really small brush or mask the windows with masking tape leaving only the frame visible and then paint the frame. If paint smears you can remove the excess (once dried) with a toothpick (wood is relatively soft, it won't mark the plastic) Thin the paint a little bit, this will help to reduce the brush marks  It seems that you painted the exterior of the radiators black, it should be only on the inside (well, they should be under surface color) Filler/putty and sandpaper will help to get rid of those seam lines on your next model.    Check our wiki and feel free to ask if something is not clear (and don't forget to check our weekly ""newbie thread"")"

modelmakers,3c08tw,monkeybiziu,7,Fri Jul 3 16:19:52 2015 UTC,"Absolutely stunning.  I tried to build an old AMT kit of that, with lights, when I was about 12 (early 1990's). I could never get the engine nacelle's to stay up and it really hurt my feelings. My parents gave me the kit for my birthday as I had been obsessing about it in the local hobby shop for months (if I remember correctly, back then it was a very expensive kit at about $45). I don't think any one modelling experience effected me so negatively as my failure on that kit.  It is my arch-nemesis. I hope to revisit it one day, but until I get the courage up I will just look at pictures of yours with awe.  Great job!"
modelmakers,3c08tw,Fortunate_0ne,7,Fri Jul 3 17:20:52 2015 UTC,"That kit was actually the inspiration for doing this one. My mom and I used to stay up late building and painting a new kit before every new Star Trek movie. I built this one for her.  The old 1/537 AMT kit was awful. Inaccurate all over the place, and as you and I and everyone else found out, the nacelles drooped like crazy.  This version is much smaller, about 12"". If you're up for a challenge, try the 1/350. That one clocks in at 36"" ."
modelmakers,3c08tw,InconsiderateBastard,5,Fri Jul 3 17:32:34 2015 UTC,I had a very similar experience.  Looking back I'm pretty sure I put so much glue that it liquified where the nacelle struts connect to the engineering section of the ship.  Because ~12 year old me thought tons more glue would make it hold together better.
modelmakers,3c08tw,flounderflound,6,Fri Jul 3 17:42:22 2015 UTC,"And now for my latest entry, the Enterprise Refit.

modelmakers,3c08tw,TeCuervo,1 point,Fri Jul 3 23:34:40 2015 UTC,Looks good like that. When I did mine I used the included aztecing decals. All 200 of 'em (plus). I bet masking made a lot more sense.
modelmakers,3c08tw,Joename,2,Sat Jul 4 01:44:18 2015 UTC,"They both have advantages and drawbacks.   Decals are much harder to screw up, but vary wildly in quality.   Masks are much more detailed, but because they're vinyl they have a tendency to stick to paint in a way decals won't, so removing them becomes nerve wracking if the paint isn't perfect. Also, decals can do detail at a level on smaller kits that would be impossible to replicate with masks."

modelmakers,3c0n9j,sophiaross,5,Fri Jul 3 18:08:36 2015 UTC,So do you tank guys like the way they've gone?
modelmakers,3c0n9j,Timmyc62,3,Fri Jul 3 20:52:47 2015 UTC,"I can't speak for the 1/35 guys, but their 1/72 offerings have sort of been on the downward slope of a bell curve for a while now. I don't mind the DS tracks because they haven't looked that bad in 1/72 and they play nicely with glue (also link and length at this scale is cutting it close to even my limit). Their early die cast body kits were pretty terrible so it's not like they started out strong and got worse either.  Accuracy has always been a problem for them that seems to be getting worse now over time, like they've already peaked. Some of their newer kits have reportedly had flash and parts that needed cutting to fit properly. Don't get me wrong, complaining about flash and fitment, they're still fairly good compared to the few alternatives lately.   It's just that they feel like a company that doesn't care anymore, held in higher regard than they maybe deserve. Frankly I'm looking forward to a resurgence of companies like Flyhawk who seem to care a lot about what they're putting out in 1/72."
modelmakers,3c0n9j,LemonGear,2,Fri Jul 3 21:51:51 2015 UTC,"That seems to be echoing their 1/700 ship line, sadly. After a few really well-done scaling-downs of their extremely good 1/350 US and German WWII destroyers (which were done with extensive free help from some in the community), the more recent kits have been fairly lacklustre regarding their detailing. That, plus their delay in some long-promised kits, has resulted in quite some disenchantment.   Some of us suspect it's due to their rather lucrative contract with Disney/Marvel for models of those products, which may well be distracting them from their traditional products."
modelmakers,3c0n9j,Timmyc62,2,Sat Jul 4 00:41:29 2015 UTC,"I'm a big fan of their 1/35 armor, and I too think it is slipping a bit.  The recent black label kits are generally very poor in terms of accuracy, and while other companies are releasing interesting new subjects, Dragon continues to issue minor variants of existing kits, more than a few of which are prototypes or things that never actually saw action.  They still put out good stuff, don't get me wrong, and I am really looking forward to picking up the new Tiger 131 but it used to be that new Dragon releases were the gold standard of armor kits, and I don't think that is really true anymore."
modelmakers,3c0n9j,Aiglos_and_Narsil,1 point,Sun Jul 5 02:16:58 2015 UTC,"I like their kits, but the relative simplicity of the recent offerings stopped me ordering some of their smaller kits. Is this a general trend?"
modelmakers,3c0n9j,windupmonkeys,2,Fri Jul 3 23:00:30 2015 UTC,"I got their 1/72 Panther, a relatively newer kit, and it had no PE which is uncommon for Dragon. Not even some engine screens or something.  It was still a higher-quality kit than most other 1/72 brands, but it wasn't Dragon quality.  At least they're rereleasing some of the older kits under the Cyberhobby label."
modelmakers,3c0n9j,uggmun,1 point,Fri Jul 3 23:30:27 2015 UTC,"To be honest I don't know what is happening. What i can tell you guys is that I have bought recently their new Hummel-Wespe and was comparing it with their Elefant that I had bought on the past and was on that time site in my desk, more or less the same price but less the amount of extras and quality."
modelmakers,3c0n9j,WiseKing,2,Sun Jul 5 15:16:00 2015 UTC,"No, I'm not thrilled with their direction.  However, another thought is that most of what they're putting out now is esoteric versions of major kits.  Since they covered most of the major variants of the major German vehicles years ago, they're now left with a lot of what-ifs, paper panzers, and very specific sub-variants.  So, if you look to some of their older kits - which are still pretty readily available - you can still find examples of major variants with all those goodies the vlogger presents.  While I'm not totally defending Dragon here - I'm not happy with the swing towards DS tracks and all that crap - the video is slightly misleading.  I have both of those kits in my stash and, oddly enough, I unboxed and looked at both of them today.  The Panther kit is from their ""Premium Edition"" line which, not surprisingly, comes with a shit ton of PE, metal barrel, and all sorts of other special add-on parts.   The StuG is from their Smart Kit line which, for better or worse, aims to reduce the parts count and simplify construction.  As to the price... well, the Panther kit is 9 years old.  The StuG kit is not.  Inflation is a bitch, I guess.  Again, not defending Dragon.  Just analyzing what's presented in the video.  Rumor on armorama is that Dragon has been contracted by Disney to make licensed toys and whatnot, so that's become their main focus.  The model line, specifically, the military model line is down to a skeleton crew."

Couldn't get very accurate with the shading since no matter what I do my airbrush sprays very broadly and the wash I use is a cheap, low quality wash I found at Michaels. I still think it turned out alright, my best looking build so far. I made the antennae out of some thin copper wires I got from the inside of an electrical wire. This was also my first kit using injection molded tracks, and although they are great for painting and they look good, they sure are a pain to attach. These weren't too bad but the tracks for a Revell 1/72 Tiger I'm working on went on so poorly (partly due to slightly misaligned wheels) that I probably won't return to that kit, I didn't even finish putting all the tracks on."

modelmakers,3bz09i,LemonGear,2,Fri Jul 3 12:56:22 2015 UTC,It was actually a really great kit! I usually expect the worst from Revell kits but this one had fantastic detail. My first 1/72 tank kit was an Armourfast Sherman and the amount of detail on that was abysmal. This kit had nearly the same amount of detail as a 1/35 kit and everything fit together perfectly.
modelmakers,3bz09i,BOB_9000,2,Fri Jul 3 21:51:33 2015 UTC,"The kit came together nicely!   Revell are generally among the best as far as detail for 1/72 armor, sort of like the generic Tamiya kit recommendation, Revell is usually a safe bet (except they use a lot of link and length tracks). Armourfast are old OLD HaT reboxes, sometimes retooled but showing their age.   If you ever get super bored, check out On The Way's manufacturers page or Henk's site.

Not so good for brush painting, but I've even had success with that, using isopropyl alcohol as a thinner. Much as I try to love Vallejo, since their color range is so wide and their colors so rich, I just can't. They're not bad for brush painting, but I don't do a whole lot of that, and in an airbrush they drytip even when thinned way down and they take forever to dry for some reason."

It's 104° F outside right now so opening the window is literally the last thing I want to do while trying to enjoy my hobby.   The other ~160 bottles of paint I have are the Badger Minitaire line which has grown on me a lot as I've worked with it, really good stuff overall, except their metallics which royally suck. (think glitter in paint roughly the shade of metal.   I also have most of the AlClad II line and have started getting some of the Gunze lines as well.   Each one is great in it's own way for sure. Except the humbrol Acrylics.. man I really hate that stuff. Sprays like ass, a bitch to brush paint, and just overall a disappointment. Been bitter about it for almost a year now since I spent like $80 on it and it was terrible."
modelmakers,3bzp3o,windupmonkeys,3,Fri Jul 3 15:38:52 2015 UTC,"There's a way to salvage that paint and make it very usable.    Mix it with 50% tamiya acrylic clear and spray it. Either that, or try mixing it same ratio with future floor polish. It's how I got this to happen:   http://imgur.com/a/y5mLA  Look at the blue spitfire. That's painted with humbrol acrylics mixed with tamiya clear at approximately the ratios described. By using the tamiya clear as the ""carrier"" of the crappy humbrol paint, you make it airbrush friendly, with less of the adhesion problems as before and no surface tension problems. Hope that helps."

modelmakers,3by0dy,Fortunate_0ne,0,Fri Jul 3 02:23:08 2015 UTC,"So, I chickened out on trying a pin wash, though I ordered the paints to do it.  I'm a little slow to adopt new techniques, and I had already broke new ground with pre-shading this model.  One new technique per build is enough.   I need to paint the wing tip formation lights, install the landing gear and a few other tiny parts, and I can probably wrap this up. I still haven't figured how I am going to install the canopy in the open position as there is no real way to connect the parts beyond trying to glue two smooth curved pieces of clear plastic at a tangent point. I will have to think on that for a bit.  If this kit is any indication, people shouldn't be too scared of the Academy P-38's boom alignment.  I didn't think it was all that bad.   One thing that I am kicking myself for is that I put the props on the wrong side. The blades should turn outward over the top of the wing, and mine would turn inward. Most people wouldn't know that, but I knew better and just flat out effed up.  There are plenty of things on this model that I sort of rushed through because I will be building the Eduard boxing of this kit shortly, but I know that it is doable and builds up to a relatively nice kit with even modest effort. i hope to really spend some time on the Eduard lightning and do it up right.  http://imgur.com/a/wDxy3"

These days, the model series is known more by ""Maschinen Krieger"" or ""Ma.K"".  The Fledermaus kit seems to be pretty rare and usually fairly expensive. There's one on eBay now, and the price is in the neighborhood of $60 US, with a damaged box. I got mine for around $12, but it is partially assembled and there are some broken pieces.

ID focus your wear and tear more on the running gear, tools, hatch edges than the general rust streaks. You can liven it up as well by painting the gun cleaning rods wood and throwing a bit of mud/dust on the running gear. Other than that, looks good. If you take it out of Kursk it would be fine, touch up the hatches, add a crew of broken tankers crawling away?"
modelmakers,3bw5ns,Feralwestcoaster,1 point,Thu Jul 2 19:20:37 2015 UTC,"I can, and will get around to most of that, apart from a couple of things. The tank'll be crawling with red shock troops, so adding germans in the mess would just complicate matters. As for the mud and such, I was holding off on it until I would have the base completed, to match the colours of the ground and the mud on the tank, etc. The cleaning rods were apparently made of metal, save a wooden handle, which I already painted. As for the hatches, I'm really tempted to commit blasphemy and leave them white for the sake of contrast, although I'll definitely consider painting them grey. As for the setting itself, there's nothing specific to Kursk in it, no Ferdinands or anything of the sort, so it could be considered some other generic battle, from earlier in the war. Thanks for the feedback though, I'll definitely do some of the things you suggested."
modelmakers,3bw5ns,Disgruntled_Old_Trot,3,Thu Jul 2 19:51:40 2015 UTC,"You might want to look at some reference photos, but I've gotten the impression that while the interior of the tank would be white, the inside color of any hatches would match the exterior color so as to not ruin the camouflage effect when open."
modelmakers,3bw5ns,Anonieme_Angsthaas,1 point,Thu Jul 2 17:35:08 2015 UTC,"I did try, but I couldn't find much in terms of that, so I resorted to taking references from a tank sim, and according to that the hatches were the same colour as the rest of the interior."
modelmakers,3bw5ns,peasfrog,2,Thu Jul 2 19:17:41 2015 UTC,"Early Models were painted in a color named Elfenbein, almost all hatches were painted in this color on the inside. Only hatches that are usually left open during combat (ie the commanders cupola hatch). Later models from 1943 onwards sometimes weren't painted at all and just had the red oxide primer as an interior color.  Buuut, this isn't set in stone at all. I've seen examples of the turret hatches on the sides painted in the interior color, but also in the exterior color"

When you set up a diorama you're telling us a story, and so far you've forgotten a few pages. Why are those tracks broken? Did the tank hit mines? Poor maintenance? Defective parts? Hits from enemy tanks or from infantry-placed explosives?"
modelmakers,3bw5ns,flounderflound,1 point,Thu Jul 2 22:17:30 2015 UTC,"Well, the penetrations do explain themselves. However, you're right about the tracks, I haven't much of an explanation for that. Some gibbon made the tracks too short when designing the model, and they don't wrap around the tank, so I had to improvise. If you have any suggestions for explaining that in the diorama, I'd be really grateful, as I'm at a loss myself. Either way, this tank is mainly part of the backdrop. The diorama mainly focuses on a KV-2 with a squad of shock troops riding on it."
modelmakers,3bw5ns,metal_fever,1 point,Thu Jul 2 22:25:04 2015 UTC,"Aaaahhhhh, I know the exact kit you built here. Bought that one myself once, had the same problem amongst a host of others. Actually got a free Tamiya PzIV D out of that, <3 Tower Hobbies. But I digress.  If the diorama has it versing a KV-2, my suggestion would be to put a couple blast craters close to but not quite on top of either track. A direct hit from a KV-2 would have totally annihilated a PzIV, but a hit about 3-6 meters away would have blasted the tracks off and stripped it of loosely attached bits, fenders, suspension, etc without outright destroying it. KV-2 reload was also ridiculously long, so either a towed AT gun or a T-34/76 would have rolled in to give it the penetrating hits you've already depicted and 'make sure'.  That's what I'd do, anyway."
modelmakers,3bxypv,Greguire,6,Fri Jul 3 02:07:34 2015 UTC,"My go-to with the old heat-rivet vinyls is CA glue, a hobby knife and some sort of clamping device(Forceps in my case).  1: SCratch up the contact areas with the knife. Sandpaper would also work, 80 grit ideal, if you can get in in there. But I have trouble getting it in such a small place on /35th tracks, much less /72nd, so the knife'll have to do. Make it as rough as you can.  2: Apply CA clue and connect the ends.  3: Clamp with your clamping device and wait a few minutes.  4: Congrats, you now have a glue joint on vinyl tracks so strong that the tracks will 99 times out of 100 break elsewhere in the run before the joint pops!~"
modelmakers,3bxypv,MrBlankenshipESQ,3,Fri Jul 3 02:10:23 2015 UTC,"by CA glue do you mean Cyanoacrylate glue? Just tried looking it up and that's what I come up with, your solution sounds almost too good to be true! thanks for the reply."
modelmakers,3bxypv,MrBlankenshipESQ,4,Fri Jul 3 03:03:42 2015 UTC,"I do, yes, and it does work. But only if you rough up the tracks first.

AFV club also takes the same approach, as does Bronco. Nice kits, but vastly overengineered. For example, AFV Club's Bofors gun has you assemble the legs for the gun carriage separately (and they actually work). Guns have springs for the recoil springs, springs in some of their suspensions, separate pieces for individual layers of the gun shields....good for people who love to build, but even for me the pieces were a bit fiddly."

There is one major exception, their FW-190. Fit is terrible.   Other than that, recent Revell Germany releases (always research the kit) are good.   Similarly, Hasegawa kits generally fit pretty well.   Other manufacturers, but whose kits I like (even if not the easiest to build or fit perfectly)are:  AMK Models, Kinetic Models, Zoukei Mura, Eduard (generally, I prefer their profipack range), RS models (because they have a lot of strange subjects)."

modelmakers,3bxp7c,Anonieme_Angsthaas,1 point,Fri Jul 3 19:24:37 2015 UTC,"Yes. Unless I got a badly shot model, the fit is atrocious.   Be careful assembling the fuselage. The brilliant engineer who designed it thought it would be a good idea to have the two halves have no support for the vast length of the fuselage and then install parts up top.   The area where the machine guns are on the fuselage is particularly poorly fitting. Test fit religiously.   The wings are okay, but the cannons are also a bit problematic. Expect to have to shave portions of the cannons to have them fit in the wing boxes properly.   The engine fit is also a bit...vague. They expect you to put the cooling fins through these slots in the fuselage. Whatever you do, don't mess up that alignment or the fit problem becomes even worse.   It was a very disappointing kit. It looks nice when you start it, you think it's going to fit, but the fuselage design was just a very poor decision, probably designed to get as many variants as possible."
modelmakers,3bxp7c,windupmonkeys,1 point,Fri Jul 3 19:56:28 2015 UTC,"Ah.. I finished the wings and fuselage and was having the same issues with the front end of the plane. The cannons were a bit fiddly, but they weren't much of a problem for me. I thought I messed up glueing the fuselage halves together, because the machine gun hatch didn't fit, and the front part of the engine cowling is too big."

If you're the type who only builds kits that fit perfectly, or are relatively new, always look there to see when it was first issued.   Some companies' kits, even if older, fit well. Most tamiya kits, for example, generally fit well even if they were first issued decades ago. Some kits from modern manufacturers still fit poorly even though they were recently tooled."

Bandai's newer kits seem to be really strong if you wanna build some Star Wars stuff.  Trumpeter's 2005+ kits that I've bought all seem to be really well made as well. I've picked up three newer kits and all of them just seem to exude quality and include some bits of PE and just great molding detail.   Airfix's 1/72 new protection kits seem to go together really well but there is always at least one part it seems that is really warped or simply too fragile for what it is. The P-51D kit it's the landing gear, I've seen 4 of those kits, all from different retailers have the exact same landing gear issue. The new tool BF109-E4 I think it is has a warped rear canopy that is grossly misshapen and way too large, seen this from three different examples. Both issues can be worked around, but it just seems like it's a huge wart on some really fantastic kits."

It was the cheapest 1:35 I can find in my local hobby shop (mind me... as I have been saving for an apartment) and actually I was quite surprised by the quality of this kit because this kit was made in 1969! And no changes has ever been made.  It turns out everything fits nicely, with only minor sanding and cutting the flash here and there.   However, there are 3 major mistakes: the gun cover is missing, the stowage floor is missing and the hawser was incorrect.  I used a medium thickness cloth and fold it for the gun cover. Then I used soldering lead for the turret side handle rails, because I like the uneven/bent look on the handle.  Overall, a very pleasant building experience. No regret buying this!

This kit would do. It's no Dragon quality, but it's pretty decent for a kit made in 1974. You'll be seeing a few parts that aren't modeled correctly, and could be fixed up with some more scrap building, but I couldn't bother (things like the headlights and the .50 caliber gun barrel).   A lot of scrap building was put into this kit. For instance, the texture of the turret and the lower glacis were both made to look like they were made of caste iron, which they were made of. I also had to add the canvas which I made of epoxy putty. Another thing I had to remake was the machine gun, the antenna, the commanders hatches, the driver hatches, the left side port hatch.   As for painting it was my simple: Black Primer, Preshade with base color , base color, gloss coat, washes, matt coat, light pigments.  This was actually the first time I tried sponge chipping, and I must say; I really enjoyed it. I'm not sure if it came out well, but I think I'll be doing it more often. This is also the first time I had no trouble with gluing on the tracks. I finally bought my self the CA (Cyanoacrylate) glue. And golly, is it amazing. This was the main reason I didn't like tanks. And now I love them. I wish I wasn't going to Estonia/Latvia... I want to make more models!  This is a great kit for the beginner. And a fun project for the advanced modeler (as you will need to do some scrap building; but not enough to make you depressed). I completely recommend."
modelmakers,3bu6ky,windupmonkeys,2,Thu Jul 2 04:34:53 2015 UTC,"nice job.   What was the material used for the cast texture?    Also, you might want to rotate the track on the left side of the vehicle a bit. You can hide that section where the track edges are missing (front of the vehicle, a bit behind the front drive sprocket, lefthand side).   As for the machine gun, if it's just a tube, try some wire, or stretched sprue. That assumes there's no perforations on the barrel such as via a barrel shroud or anything like that."
modelmakers,3bu6ky,windupmonkeys,2,Thu Jul 2 04:55:47 2015 UTC,"I just took some filler and spackled it on. Making sure to make the texture rough. Then, I went over it with some thick grit sandpaper, and fined it down with some softer sandpaper.   Also, you might want to rotate the track on the left side of the vehicle a bit. You can hide that section where the track edges are missing (front of the vehicle, a bit behind the front drive sprocket, lefthand side).   Shoot! I didn't see that. I'll rotate it now.   And as for the machine gun, it's not just a tube. It looks nice. But the holes in the barrel (not sure what they're called) are sculpted outwards rather than inwards."
modelmakers,3bu6ky,drone207A,2,Thu Jul 2 05:21:27 2015 UTC,"Oh, I meant the 30 cal up front, not the .50.   There's a seam line running down the split of the barrel in the forward facing turret.   If you want to highlight the gun, you could do a number of things.  1. brush graphite powder or use a pencil to add scratches/gunmetal color.  2. drybrush the holes or to emphasize those perforations you see on the .50. I'd probably use a dark metallic gray."
modelmakers,3bu6ky,uggmun,1 point,Thu Jul 2 05:26:48 2015 UTC,"As for the holes, I'm refering to the .50.   I see the seem now, wish I caught that earlier. I could sand it and repaint it... We'll see.   I did use some graphite powder on it... I think I did that before the matt coat.   I also fixed the track. It's all good now. Thanks for spotting that out."
modelmakers,3bu6ky,drone207A,2,Thu Jul 2 05:43:21 2015 UTC,I'm new to modeling... Could you please explain how you did the texture? Great work by the way
modelmakers,3bu6ky,Aiglos_and_Narsil,3,Thu Jul 2 12:16:14 2015 UTC,"Basically, I sanded down the original hull work. Then took some filler putty (the stuff to fill gaps in the models), diluted it with , and Spackled it on the areas where there would be cast iron, such as the mantle, turret, lower glacis. Then with the rough shape, I take a rough grit sandpaper to sand it down. Then take a very fine grit sandpaper to make it to scale.  I took a picture of a book with the technique"
modelmakers,3bu6ky,Prawn_Creep,1 point,Thu Jul 2 14:05:30 2015 UTC,This is awesome. I'm thinking of doing an M4A1 soon and this will come in handy for the cast hull and turret.
modelmakers,3bua3c,alaskafish,3,Thu Jul 2 05:12:17 2015 UTC,"Review/Building and Painting Process:  Now I love Zvezda's Art of Tactic series for wargaming. I don't wargame, but I love the quality in their small scale figures. Since I'm going to St. Petersburg in Russia in a few days, I got this kid because I never painted Soviets before.  It was great. The figures needed to be assembled, but you don't need glue. You do need some filler (and you can see the areas that I wasn't able to fill). Not a lot of filler, but filler to fill in the seams. The kit costs roughly $5, and comes with 4 figures and a base. Two have SVT-40's and two have Mosin Nagants. Also, two are depicted in amoeba smocks.   As for painting, it was airbrushed black primer. For the figures, they were given a coat of Khaki. The helmet was painted Russian Armor Green, the belts and such were Hull Red mixed with a bit of Dark Camo Brown. Then they were given a slather wash of Brown enamel wash. I know, I didn't put on a gloss coat, but I don't like putting a gloss coat when it comes with figures. Gloss coats on figures fills up too many of the very small details. I just put the wash quickly and sparingly. Then finally a matt coat to finish it off.  I completely recommend any of Zvezda's Art of Tactic sets. They're cheap, fun to build, and incredibly detailed."
modelmakers,3bua3c,LemonGear,3,Thu Jul 2 05:12:20 2015 UTC,I'd have to second your recommendation of Zvezda's figures. I got their Russian winter soldiers set almost a month ago for the Eastern Front groupbuild and the detailing is CRISP! I haven't had the time to work on anything much these past few weeks but it's cool to see these figures here all built up and all!
modelmakers,3bua3c,plqamz,2,Thu Jul 2 05:40:51 2015 UTC,"I was surprised when I first saw the details. I was used to shoddy IMEX, Pegasus, Airfix, ect. But when I open this, and the eyebrows and nostrils are sculpted nicely... you got to hand it to Zvezda."

Piston moved the paddle, paddled pushed or pulled the cables, moving the roof up and down. we even made it beep and a wee light come on and what not. very cute, as recycling plants go.   I was wondering if you could simply your construction to something similar? Have the cables push the door up and open, have them pull it shut.  but yeah, pictures would be helpful...."
modelmakers,3bw7dn,Mchawkeye,1 point,Thu Jul 2 19:12:22 2015 UTC,If only we could simplify the design.... However part of the clients budget is coming from a sponsorship by the rolling door company. They make roll up doors and have been adamant about seeing the thing roll up.
modelmakers,3bw7dn,ItsADanThing,2,Thu Jul 2 21:24:22 2015 UTC,"I assume you are talking about a roll up door something like this.   I would guess that it is either caused by the rollers not entering the track smoothly, or because there is not enough weight to overcome the friction in the track.   The first could likely be fixed by making a tapered opening into the track, something like this (pardon the quick drawing).   The second issue would be fixed by your idea of adding tension springs to help pull the door down. Another possible solution could be to add a piece of metal at the bottom of the door to increase its weight so it will slide down the track."
modelmakers,3bw7dn,HughJorgens,1 point,Thu Jul 2 19:26:36 2015 UTC,That is the type of door I'm talking about. Tapered guides aren't a bad idea either. Next iteration is in the printer now.

modelmakers,3bw7dn,BOB_9000,1 point,Thu Jul 2 21:26:23 2015 UTC,"Could you make the door not actually roll up, just raise and go back under the roof somewhere?  It could exit out the front of a fake roller, so it looks right, then retract backwards without actually rolling up and just lay against the ceiling,or into any space that might be between the roof and ceiling."

modelmakers,3buvxu,X28,2,Thu Jul 2 11:24:52 2015 UTC,You want to check the power of the fan as you don't want it to suck all the paint to the back before reaching the model. I took a power supply from an old computer case and hook three case fans that I can disconnect as needed -- big 1/32 fuselage priming will need 3 running while painting small parts will need just one.

That's a side project though (What? The only thing more ""model maker-ish"" is having not only too many kits on your table, but having too many other types of build projects going.).  Can't lie though, those $80 collapsing booths online are really tempting."
modelmakers,3buvxu,Prestersean,1 point,Fri Jul 3 21:43:11 2015 UTC,"I tried a few DIY options and my biggest obstacle/challenge is the clean up. Fan and structure are easier to handle, but making sure that the booth is clean before you start a new job, or swirching from dark to light is a serious job. Those collapsible hood is pretty good until you hit the bigger 1/32, and the paint particles latch on well on the plastic walls (which means you'll need to cover them up). Don't forget daylight balanced light for the interior/and or clear walls. Pls share your plans!"
modelmakers,3buvxu,pxpxpx,1 point,Sat Jul 4 11:26:10 2015 UTC,"I did this, what I didn't do was pay attention to the CFM rating of the extractor - so it was shite and didn't pull enough air through.  The CFM needs to be balanced so as not to be too high and ideally the fan should be largeish I believe"
modelmakers,3buvxu,Quarterscale,1 point,Thu Jul 2 12:38:35 2015 UTC,"What do you build? Like /u/X28 references,  size of the models determines a lot.

modelmakers,3buvxu,wh1stler,1 point,Thu Jul 2 15:38:36 2015 UTC,"What do you build? What do you spray? What area do you spray in?  DIY solutions can work. Make sure your fan handles at least 120 cubic feet per minute, spraying solvent based paint like laquers etc. look into explosion proof fans.   Most of the commercially available spray booths fold down (or disassembles) into a small and handy package. Which IMO makes them superior to DIY solutions."

Weathering was done via Bragdon weathering powders.  I initially started for just light use weathering but it became ""left out sitting in the Fulda Gap somewhere for a decade"" mighty quick.

modelmakers,3brc50,MrBlankenshipESQ,2,Wed Jul 1 18:18:12 2015 UTC,"Seriously!  From what I understand, Dragon came out with magic tracks because everyone was bitching about the on-the-sprue variety of individual-link tracks.  Then everyone bitched about magic tracks because they thought they should be click-together and that they were too hard to put together.  So no, Dragon replaced them with DS tracks and everyone's bitching about them.    sigh"
modelmakers,3brc50,Gewehr43,1 point,Thu Jul 2 11:18:05 2015 UTC,"I'm really annoyed that Dragon stopped including magic track in their new kits.   Eh, I'm not. Maybe it's because I've only ever built one Dragon kit with them(The CyberHobby M4A3 Sherman), but I found them to be a horrid fit. Literally. I had to trim half an inch out of each side to get a loose fit. They were also molded in the most god awful shade of Yellow that means they're gonna fight me to get a decent coloring out of 'em.  I'm gonna end up putting Friuls on that thing someday."
modelmakers,3brc50,MrBlankenshipESQ,2,Wed Jul 1 19:19:58 2015 UTC,"I'm confused.  You say you don't miss magic tracks, but go on to (rightfully) talk shit about their DS tracks.  The one-piece vinyl-ish, yellow tracks are DS (Dragon Styrene©®℗™).  Magic tracks - which I adore - are individual link, gray, molded plastic that usually require minimal cleanup to get going.  They are a breeze to work with if you know the secret tamiya extra thin cement."
modelmakers,3brc50,Aiglos_and_Narsil,1 point,Thu Jul 2 11:24:29 2015 UTC,"I might or might not have been a bit sleepy, but no I don't miss magic tracks either as I simply don't enjoy glue-together assembly tracks. For clarification's sake I was the whole time referring to DS, though, as found on my CyberHobby M4A3 Sherman."
modelmakers,3brc50,MrBlankenshipESQ,1 point,Thu Jul 2 12:00:12 2015 UTC,"Every time I've used them, I've found they need one or two links trimmed off to fit properly.  It also can be difficult to get them to sag properly, especially on tanks with loose saggy tracks like the Pz III or Pz IV."
modelmakers,3brc50,Aiglos_and_Narsil,1 point,Wed Jul 1 19:23:05 2015 UTC,"The sagging thing is always gonna be an issue with rubber band tracks regardless of who makes them and the only way you'll ever get a realistic sag is if you use individual white metal links in a workable track(AKA Friuls for most tanks but there are other brands making these), but I honestly don't get how literally everyone else at that level can make vinyl tracks that fit perfectly yet Dragon always makes them too long. Bugs the hell out of me, and quite frankly puts me off of buying Dragon models alltogether."
modelmakers,3brc50,MrBlankenshipESQ,1 point,Wed Jul 1 19:28:55 2015 UTC,"I can get good sag with individual plastic links, like the magic track that Dragon used to give you.  I'm sure fruils would be better/easier to work with, but they don't fit in my budget.  DS tracks I think are better than the typical vinyl most companies use, they're better detailed and they take glue and paint better, but they do need to be trimmed."
modelmakers,3brc50,Aiglos_and_Narsil,2,Wed Jul 1 19:35:36 2015 UTC,"Can't say I've ever had any issue gluing together vinyl tracks before. The newer ones I glue up with normal model glue, clamp with some forceps, wait a bit, done. Strong as can be, they'll break somewhere else before that glue joint gives. The older ones? I scuff those up with my knife where the mating points are, get out the CA, then glue-and-clamp. Strong as hell yet again.  For me, the track hierarchy is:  1: Friuls  2: Vinyls  3: DS  4: click-together plastic workables  5: no tracks at all  6: link-and-length  7: glue together assembly type."
modelmakers,3brc50,MrBlankenshipESQ,1 point,Wed Jul 1 19:39:38 2015 UTC,"Individual links are, for me, the easiest and fastest type of track to work with.  I use a slow setting glue and do one whole run of track all at once.  This tutorial on Armorama was one of the first things I found when I started modeling and the technique has worked very well for me ever since.  Not trying to say you are wrong or that you should do things differently, just sharing what's worked for me.  Anything that gets the track on there are looks like the real thing is good in my book."

modelmakers,3brc50,frugm1,5,Wed Jul 1 18:31:35 2015 UTC,"I finished my RoAF IAR332 . I ended up ditching the SOCAT scratchbuild because I had some difficulties with the sheet of styrene that I bought and didn't want to mess up the rest of the build for not all that many details (I wasn't planning on adding the missile hardpoints anyway, only the targetting system and the autocannon). Maybe when I get an actual 330 kit I'll consider it again :), since I have some missile launchers from a Mig 21 that will not be used.  All things said I liked the kit, the instructions were a bit weird in some places, namely the rotor hub and blade attachments, and the wheel fairings were a bit annoying to place, but nothing too major. Funny story about Heller's part support, I was missing the top fairing on the right side and sent them an email about it, then called two weeks afterwards since I received no answer. A week after the call the missing piece came in the mail, and then about two weeks ago I got the same envelope with the same piece. My guess is they saw the email much later, and it was a bit silly to receive another one.  In terms of camo I had some issue getting the shade of orangey yellow used on the craft, but then again from my reference images, the shade is not very consistent across the helicopters, so Tamiya Dark Yellow was a decent approximation. It's much closer to what they have on the jets, but depending on the angle it is not too far off. I was minimalist in decals because I didn't want to detract from the camo pattern, and they're pretty hard to spot on the real ones. Fun stuff, but I won't start another build until I get another batch of needed tools, Future Floor Polish being a priority."

The paint is Tamiya’s TS-14 black - used their grey primer for 2 coats, a couple coats of black and then a clear coat using ts-13 after sanding between coats.  Then did a Wet sand on the final paint job with 2500 and 4000 to get rid of any orange peel and then loosely followed a finescalemodeler video for the rest :  Mequiars x20 scratch remover – rinsed - Tamiya coarse polish – rinsed - Tamiya fine polish – rinsed - Skipped Tamiya finish polish due to a amazon snafu - Mequiars Crystal Polish- rinse - Mequiars Canuba wax.

modelmakers,3br5p8,Fortunate_0ne,1 point,Wed Jul 1 14:19:21 2015 UTC,"Forgive me I am a bit new to modeling. I believe the softener may be kind of what I am looking for.   I am placing decals on the arms of basis wayfarer style sunglasses. The surface is quite smooth and glossy even with the color enamel gloss paint layer on top. I have to remove the silver inlaid piece from the eye piece, fill it, sand it down, and apply a matching color coat. I use a high gloss enamel.  So here was my quandary: Using my setting solution I placed my decal and smoothed out any air bubbles to ensure it was 100% flat on the surface, I then applied an extra small drop of setting solution and allowed it to dry.   Once dry I applied a thin two layers of topcoat with an airbrush. (I am trying to not apply to many layers to the surface as this item has hinges.) Once everything cured it looked great however the decal began to loosen and peel after my fingernail grazed it. So I started over to be sure that I did not apply the final gloss coat too soon and did not give the decal and setting solution enough time to dry... it did it again.  If anything snags the edges of where the decal was placed the decal becomes compromised. Seeing as they are sunglasses I really need the decal to be durable through light- medium handling.   Does the decal softener assist in dissolving the waterslide decal paper onto the surface that it is applied to?  I'm thinking I need something better than just a simple setting solution. I would love to know your opinions and recommendations."
modelmakers,3br5p8,solipsistnation,3,Wed Jul 1 15:56:20 2015 UTC,"If you're using model supplies, you should know that mostly they're not meant to cover stuff that is going to be heavily handled like sunglasses.  You might look into a more solid clearcoat, like hardware store rattlecan stuff, or even something like a thin epoxy resin.   You could probably also mask around the hinges-- fold them flat, put a piece of paper between the bow of the glasses and the lenses, then fold a piece of tape into an L-shape, sticky side out, and put it into the hinge itself so you could fold it into the hinge, covering the flat end of the bow where it meets the frames and ideally keeping any overspray from hitting the hinge mechanism. Then you could be more liberal with the topcoat...  (I could probably draw you some kind of crude diagram if my explanation isn't very clear...)"
modelmakers,3br5p8,ionizzatore,2,Wed Jul 1 18:09:20 2015 UTC,"I do agree that the choice of decal is probably not the best choice. I may look into rub-on/transfer decals.

I'm sorry if i bothered you with this matter but ""paper"" triggered terrible memories, the butchering of Air Canada Q.O  In that case the suggestion of the others are correct:   If you want to use decals: you need a glossy surface as a base and you need to seal the decals with some non water/alcohol based paint (enamels should work), but if you really want some extra strength epoxy paint is your best choice (it's commonly used to seal airbrush works on helmets or motorcycle fuel tanks). The downside is that epoxy paint costs a lot ant it has a very short life (once ""activated"" you have usually 30 or even less minutes, after that time the paint is dry and you cannot use that mix anymore). Epoxy paint is resistant to sweat, rain, UV, whatever. If you want to change ""medium"" you can try vinyl transfers, they are easy to use and usually less delicate than decals (but unfortunately less ""flat"", you will be able to se the edge of the decal)"

modelmakers,3bpy0y,theminorblues,7,Wed Jul 1 05:14:00 2015 UTC,"Guillows kits (at least in the last decade) have had a long history of supplying very overweight wood, poor quality die cutting, and the plastic vacuform parts are just way too heavy for something as small as a 17 inch wingspan model. To that end, if you want this thing to fly:   Elmers glue is too heavy, better to use wood cement. While it will definitely join parts, it's very heavy. If you must use it, use it sparingly and the minimum amount needed to join it.   You must have straight/level surfaces for the plane to fly properly, e.g. no ""warps"" in the frames. Any distortion in the frames will have to be compensated for with flight adjustments because any flying surface (wings, tail, rudder) warpage (curving left or right, outside of the stated parameters provided in the instructions) will cause it to fly in the way that it's aerodynamically affected.   Yes as to upgrades. In fact, I think one of the most essential to get consistent flying performance is installation of a proper nose block, if the propeller is NOT resting against solid wood but the plastic cowl.  You should consider installing a proper nose block and replacing the rubber band. The ""peg"" that holds the rubber in is best replaced by a similarly sized aluminum tube.   No to strengthening the wood by say, soaking it in glue. You MIGHT consider doing that only to limited areas that are particularly structural stress points: e.g. the wing roots, where the wing spar joins the fuselage, that sort of thing,  but do so sparingly. The tissue covering will help strengthen the frame once you shrink the tissue. You might consider replacing the kit wood with something lighter, but if you insist on using the kit wood, treat it carefully. it's fragile stuff in some cases, and absurdly heavy in others.  Yes, you can use colored tissue paper, you can also use a gluestick (UHU is preferred among free flight modelers) to apply tissue to the frame, as traditional nitrate dope is hard to get outside of aircraft supply houses. ""domestic"" tissue that you get in the gift shop will work, but it's heavier than more specialized stuff. However, the white tissue in a guillows kit is pretty heavy anyway, so it's probably no weight penalty for you to say, switch to silver coated tissue.   Here is a tutorial on how to build one of thesee    Upgrades:    Install a nose block.  See here: http://www.hippocketaeronautics.com/hpa_forum/index.php?topic=13757.0   Scigs30 on RCgroups is one of the most prolific builders of successfully flying guillows derived models. See post number 8, that's him.   Examples of his work are here: (also you can see his retrofit of a nose block for his hurricane) http://www.rcgroups.com/forums/showthread.php?t=927503  Examples of a nose block can be see also been in this thread page, but you need to engineer your own out of balsa or spare wood. The way the cowl attaches generally is probably pretty poor.  http://www.stickandtissue.com/cgi-bin/yabb2/YaBB.pl?num=1363062829/30  https://freeflight.org/DigestOnline/TechLibrary/GuilllowsKitstoFly.pdf  The biggest upgrade you can give to a guillows kit:  1. Lighter wood. Unfortunately unless guillows has replaced (they were supposed to introduce laser cut parts into all their kits) the die ""crushed"" wood with laser cut wood, the parts themselves tend to be quite fragile, not counting the strip stock they give you (which tends to be overweight). Be careful removing those precut parts. take a knife to them to make sure they will separate at the notches, etc, without cracking or breaking the part. if they do, just glue it back together.  2. Ditch heavy parts like wheels, overly thick vacuformed canopies, (build them out of acetate and a balsa frame instead) 3. Build in a real nose block instead of relying upon the plastic.  4. Lightness, without compromising strength. That is extremely important in free flight models.  5. Replace the rubber. The rubber in the kits is crap. Preferred is FAI Tan Sport rubber.   Construction notes:  1. AVOID warpage of the flying surfaces at all costs. if it is warped sometimes that can be partially repaired by hold it over hot steam, then bending it.  2. Construct on a flat surface using pins to hold the pieces to the plans, which are covered with saran wrap or wax paper to prevent the parts sticking.  3. Use a gluestick if you can't use dope for attacking the tissue covering. Have a sharp, BRAND NEW blade to carefully slice it around the frames.  4. See if the plans have a balance or ""CG/CoG"" marking on them. That will tell you where the plane's center of gravity is. If you balance the plane at that point, it should sit level to the ground horizontally. If it tips forward, it's nose heavy, and will dive into the ground. If it's tipping downwards by the tail, then it's tail heavy and will stall.   Visit forums like:  hippocket aeronautics, the ""free flight scale"" section. rcgroups' free flight subforum.  The Guillows Builders forum, where you're likely to find successful builds of the very kit you're trying to build.  http://balsamodels.com/phpBB/viewtopic.php?p=11285"
modelmakers,3bpy0y,windupmonkeys,5,Wed Jul 1 05:56:57 2015 UTC,"This is a step by step breakdown of how to properly construct one of these types of models:  http://www.ffscale.co.uk/comper.htm  Since I don't have access to dope, I'd probably swap the dope for UHU glue stick adhesive for the tissue portion of the build.   Also:   PHOTOCOPY your parts to provide yourself with templates to make spares. I think for this particular series, Guillows provided a reduced version (that can be scaled up on a copier) to provide you with spare parts, but you might as well go ahead and xerox the parts now at full size to save yourself some bother.   Make sure to check the plans carefully, Guillow's plans have never been the clearest and most of them are decades old. Look for things like deviations between a ""display"" model and ""flying"" model. It's likely that your P-51 will need significant dihedral (when looking at the airplane from the front, the wingtips are angled upwards) to fly properly as a free flight aircraft, something the plans might mention in fine print, or fail to mention at all. I can't tell you what angle to set it at, if any; talk to someone on the forums I mentioned or look up someone's build of the same kit.   Low wing planes if I remember correctly require more dihedral than high winged planes (where the wings are attached on top of the fuselage versus like on the P-51, on the bottom of the fuselage).   Like I said in the next comment below, while cheap to buy, they are not the easiest to make fly well.   I once had their Cessna 150. It was so overengineered, it was clearly designed to fly with an engine instead of the rubber included. Even if it wasn't, the wood was several pounds heavier per square foot than I would've used. I considered flat out redrawing the wing plans to eliminate HALF of the ribs present in the structures to lighten the plane, that's how overengineered some of the guillows planes are. For these smaller, 17 inch span ones, they'll be overengineered in some areas, and underengineered in others.   Pay attention for example to the landing gear attachments. If there's one area you might consider reinforcing aside from where the wing joins the fuselage, that's one area you can consider strengthening. If its underengineered, it's liable to rip off on a rough landing, for example.   I think the kits included either wooden wheels (ditch those and build your own foam ones, these are absurdly heavy) made out of some absurdly heavy hardwood, or plastic wheels (depending on how heavy they are, replace with a wheel made of a bunch of balsa discs laminated together).   The point is, it's hard to make a guillows kit out of the box, using kit wood, to fly for a very long time. Will it fly? Yeah, probably, if you build it properly. But you can also significantly increase your chances of a more flying model by doing some of what I mentioned.   Bottom line, I'd make sure to check to see the nose block is good, replace the rubber, and build as light as possible while reinforcing some major structural joints. However, soaking it in glue (a favored method of cheating in those structural engineering bridge competitions) will only make it heavy and brittle."
modelmakers,3bpy0y,windupmonkeys,5,Wed Jul 1 06:10:05 2015 UTC,"As for kits, I like these kits as well.   However, if i were to pick manufacturers, Guillows for me is pretty much the last one on the list of manufacturers. At least as of a few years ago, the kits are so overengineered, wood is so poor, that I wouldn't bother with the kit except for the vacuform parts (probably just to build my own masters with), or the plans. I end up  throwing out the stripwood they include, and sometimes even replace the die cut parts because they're so heavy that they degrade performance.    Dumas is my main choice because all their kits provide precut, laser cut parts, and they are easy to get. They cost about 1.5 to 2x as much as a Guillows kit of equivalent size, but at the same time, often cost not all that much more. See e.g.   http://www.amazon.com/Tiger-Moth-17-5-Rubber-Power/dp/B000BQ6WPU/ref=sr_1_1?s=toys-and-games&ie=UTF8&qid=1435731236&sr=1-1&keywords=dumas+tiger+moth  http://www.amazon.com/Dumas-Corsair-17-5-Rubber-Power/dp/B000BQ4WFW/ref=pd_sim_21_9?ie=UTF8&refRID=0G0H0PR17WFX5TJWSVJ4  Other good brands:  Herr Engineering (rare these days).  Sig (at least in the old days, but I'm not even sure they're still in business)  Peck Polymer kits (if you can still find them).  Diels Engineering (they provide mostly plans, you are expected to scratchbuild and cut your own parts).  EasyBuilt Models (some of them are now laser cut, but read reviews for any particular model because they can be hit or miss, because many of their designs are decades old)."

modelmakers,3bpy0y,windupmonkeys,4,Wed Jul 1 06:41:37 2015 UTC,"Those forums will be very helpful. Hippocket and RCgroups tend to have the more active userbases, but the Guillows forum is also very helpful.   If your son wants to keep doing this, next time try a Dumas or EasyBuilt Models laser cut model.   Some of the really old model kits (Comet, etc, now long defunct) were very old school; you had to cut out EVERY part yourself. Some companies still produce kits that way:   Golden Age Reproductions Diels Engineering (with some exceptions)  West Wings (UK based).   Perhaps an easier kit might be something to start your son off with? Indeed, guillows offers some beginners kits that might be more simple to put together and offer better chances of success.   If you personally need a refesher course, these will also work quite well:   http://www.guillow.com/series4000buildnfly.aspx  Also, the Flying Aces Moth is a good design to start with.  Other good starter ROGs (Rise Off Ground); it's the traditional stick and wings designs you might be familiar with when you FIRST started flying these things:  http://www.theplanpage.com/things/ct/ct.htm.   Also good is this site, which provides very simple to build FROG models.   They are a good compromise between built up models (like the one you have) and stick models, as they have lower parts counts. However, you're stuck building your plane from scratch.   http://www.houseoffrog.co.uk/  A few english companies make laser cut versions of FROG models, but they are quite expensive.   http://www.vintagemodelcompany.com/"
modelmakers,3bpy0y,windupmonkeys,4,Wed Jul 1 06:52:41 2015 UTC,"Finally, I would recommend not using silver tissue. Use gray instead, since P-51s are ""silver"" but I expect that upon contact with water, the silver dye layer will simply fall off.   Painting is usually done with a very light application (sprayed) of whatever paint you use. I'd be partial to using anything that doesn't use alcohol as a thinner, because alcohol will remove the tissue (the solvent for the gluestick is 91% alcohol). I'd probably spray a layer of some kind of clear coating prior to painting, but given the weight penalties associated with heavy layers of paint, that's an open question. Gray will allow you to make it ""look like"" a p-51 without having to add weight by painting it, while you can apply decals for the color effects.   Another way to do it is to use ""chalk"" the tissue, which is described here: http://www.easybuiltmodels.com/chalk.htm.   I notice they mention use of certain krylon products as a sealant. I would recommend doing the same."
modelmakers,3bpy0y,chokingonlego,2,Wed Jul 1 08:27:29 2015 UTC,"Thanks. I actually have a question myself: Is there any larger balsa kit you would recommend for RC modification? I'd prefer something with a wingspan of about 24"" or larger, since it'd have a bit more wiggle room for modification."
modelmakers,3bpy0y,windupmonkeys,3,Thu Jul 2 01:55:23 2015 UTC,"If I were to pick a  guillows kit, I'd probably go with:   the Piper 95 Super Cub (laser cut version), Cessna 150, Beechcraft bonanza.   The latest new release planes from them I'd consider is:  Edge 540, or their Pilatus Porter. I would prefer the last one because it has probably good flight characteristics: high wing, ample wing area.   Other kits worth considering:  The WWI laser cut series of kits.   The problem with guillows kits is depending on what electronics you want to use, they are either built too heavy, or built too lightly to survive a crash. Expect to make some changes to accomodate things like battery access hatches, you'll have to install your own control horns on the flying surfaces  (and they are generally not hinged, so you have to modify your tail surface construction to account for that).   Guillows designs do not have removable wings, either, so that's something else to account for.   The kit wood, to be frank, until recently (there's discussion that it's starting to improve) is seriously overweight, and understrength in pretty much all the wrong places. You are well advised to weigh your own balsa wood, then cut your own strips.   The laser cut components allegedly are of better quality and weight (I should hope so, given that these kits in large extent cost more).   I would also try to obtain EasyBuilt models tissue, or Japanese tissue. It's lighter. Some of the conversion uses light films, but I prefer the old way.  Guillows is slowly adapting to modern industry by providing laser cutting for their more expensive kits.   Note: the rcgroups thread lists each kit by series number so you'll be able to identify which particular model you want to convert.   Areas I'd look at reinforcing or redrawing:  1. Tail surfaces. You might want to increase the size of the rudder for increased yaw authority, or the elevator for the same reason, but generally these are already enlarged compared to the actual aircraft in free flight plans to make them more stable in free flight.  2. Adjust dihedral angles...you might want less of it, if you want a less self-stabilizing airframe since it's now controlled, but if you're a starter pilot or you just want an easy time flying the thing, I'd leave it as it is.  3. Nose: you will definitely have to reengineer or redraw the nose to account for motor installations, as the plans provide no provision for a motor mount. Some of the planes provide templates for motor mounts, but these are for gas engines.  4. Wing joints and landing gear joints. These probably will need reinforcement, particularly the LG, since these are not the most study structures. You might want to beef up the gauge of the wire used for them too, because it will no longer be a lightly loaded balsa model, but packed with gear and electronics.  5. Spar reinforcement at the wing joints: you might consider that. 6. Eliminating extra weight: because weight is the enemy here, though too light, and any wind will make it a lousy flier sailing about the wind. You  must remember that you're installing anywhere from half an ounce to several ounces worth of equipment in there, and you must account for the increased stress that puts on the airframe. 7. Mount points for electronics. Guillows models are not designed to be taken apart to replace rubber or access the cabin, where your servos/electronic brick RX will be. you need to accomodate for this, or live with the idea of sealing it into the fuselage. I'd probably make a 1/32 thick balsa hatch. Also remember that if you're using actual servos instead of an integrated board (and even then) you're going to need to find mounts/a servo mount rack.  8. Control horns: you need to decide how you're going to actuate the flying surfaces, either via pull-pull thread method, light pushrods, etc.   In terms of kit selection, I'd pick something high winged, with large wing area, with a small frontal section (The pilatus porter seems to fit the bill for the description.) While aerodynamic drag is a much smaller concern now that you have steady electrical power, the drag from the more large cowled airframes might be worth considering. Or the effect could be negligible."
modelmakers,3bpy0y,windupmonkeys,2,Thu Jul 2 02:42:31 2015 UTC,"I might also stiffen the spars against wing flutter, with a reinforcement in the center of the wing, say a very small strip of carbon fiber, or swapping out one of the spars for something made of spruce or basswood.   To be frank, guillows kits (aside from the laser cut ones) are not really worth my money, aside from the plans. If that's the case, there's no reason why you couldn't just buy a free flight plan and convert that instead. A lot of them are much better engineered than guillows models, and don't use a bunch of non-replaceable, extremely heavy accessories for their cowls, canopies, etc."
modelmakers,3bpy0y,chokingonlego,2,Thu Jul 2 03:21:50 2015 UTC,"Thanks, I'm looking at the WW2 laser cut kits. So far it's between the 403LC P51, or the Edge 540 unless I can find a ""proper"" RC kit at my local hobby shop on sale. I'll keep your suggestions in mind."
modelmakers,3bpy0y,windupmonkeys,2,Thu Jul 2 03:24:42 2015 UTC,"To be frank, those are probably harder to convert than a standard, high wing general aviation plane, and warbirds generally are harder to fly. The conversion to free flight status will tame them some, but they are still harder to trim than a standard high wing monoplane."

modelmakers,3bl5fk,FlyingSMonster,4,Tue Jun 30 02:50:25 2015 UTC,"Was at my local hobby shop last week, browsing through their kits when I realized I never built a ship kit in my life. They didn't have that great of a selection of ships, but this Trumpeter kit caught my eye as it was the most modern kit they had and it included photo etch.   I made quite a few mistakes while building it, particularly with the photo etch railings which were incredibly flimsy and a pain in the ass to install properly. Learned a lot in the process though about how to build and paint ships.  I had to mix my own paint for the hull and other colors, as Trumpeter's instructions were riddled with errors as to which paint color was the right one to use. I think the hull gray color I choose is a little too dark for a modern JMSDF ship honestly. The bottom hull red color was suggested to be Tamiya XF-9 ""Hull Red"" which is really more of a red-brown color (without much red...) so instead I used some model master British Crimson darkened with 1/3rd raw umber.   I also kinda over-did the weathering. I'm going to take a different approach with my next kit. I should have also waited to glue the main towers and helicopter hanger onto the hull instead of gluing them on first and then painting it all together.   This kit had over 600 tiny parts to work with, was very frustrating at times working with so many small parts.   Overall though I really enjoyed building it, so much so that I plan on building a lot more ship kits in the future as opposed to aircraft and tanks. In fact, I already have a Dragon 1/350 Z-38 destroyer with eduard photo etch coming in tomorrow!"
modelmakers,3bl5fk,windupmonkeys,2,Tue Jun 30 02:55:48 2015 UTC,"Very nice! Looks like a pretty complex build.   In case you're ever interested in smaller scale ships, the 1/700 Slava Cruiser and 1/700 USS Momsen is also very good. The latter includes photoetch for the masts and some railings.   Ooo, the Z-38. I bought the 1/700 equivalent, took one look at the box and went: ""okay, I can't bend this 1mm fold for the ladders or masts.."" (puts it away)."

I just started working on it today and the little 2cm quad flakvierling mounts alone have almost 15 parts each, and they are smaller than my pinky finger! Definitely going to take a lot longer to build it compared to the Atago considering the amount of photo etch involved.   It actually has some of the smallest photo etch parts I've ever seen for the mines the ship carries in the rear. No idea how I'm going to glue them onto the plastic."

modelmakers,3bl2fg,BOB_9000,3,Tue Jun 30 03:43:03 2015 UTC,"Thanks!    I used a couple of Mig Pigment sets and applied using various techniques.  This is only the second time I've used them, so I'm still getting a feel for how they behave.  In areas like on the rear upper hull, I sprinkled dry pigment in the areas I wanted, then use a disposable pipette to drop a small amount of Mig's pigment fixer in the area.  Capillary action draws the fixer into the rest of the pigment.    If left alone, that leaves a very flat, untextured look and isn't very appealing.  So, while the fixer was still wet, I'd gather up some pigment on a brush and tap it over the area.  That really helped build up the look of a lot of dirt and mud.    Those methods would occasionally leave tide marks, so, after the fixer was dry, I took a really soft brush and gently jabbed at the edges of the mud and pulled them towards non-muddy areas.  That seemed to help the transition not look so stark and unrealistic."

Camo scheme is three tone disruptive and was thought to be of similar effect as dazzle camouflage for ships.  It wasn't a common scheme, but it was used historically.  It was an enormous pain to mask and paint properly.  It is CyberHobby kit #6524, Black Knight Panther Ausf. G Late finished with Tamiya and Vallejo paints.  Color modulation and streaking was done with oils.  Rust on cables and track washes are pastels.  Mud & dirt effects are Mig pigments.  Metallics are #2 pencil.  The kit went together beautifully.  It's really well-engineered and I'm glad I have essentially the same kit in the stash.  DS tracks do, in fact, make baby Jesus cry.  I had to use a ton of superglue to make them sit right and they're still not 100% how I want them.  I had a CyberHobby detail-up kit lying around, so I grabbed a few pieces of PE and the metal barrel from that to spruce the old girl up a bit.    Next project: Clean the damn workbench.

I've used this technique twice now and I'm happy with the results.   spray with flat black enamel - I used Testor's flat black rattle can crap. Use a file or emery board to grind up some rust-colored pastel chalks Mix chalk dust with odorless turpentine Brush liberally on cable, let dry, repeat as necessary Rub the cable with a #2 pencil.   The only potential issue is if you use a straight orange or red pastel chalk.  Those tend to be too bright and garish when they dry.  So for those cables, I ground a little red, a little orange, and some dark, rusty browns, and then applied.  What's nice is that the pastel dust doesn't really dissolve in the liquid medium.  It is just sorta held in suspension.  So, when you apply it to a surface, capillary action draws the dust into the nooks and crannies like you would expect to see in real life.  The #2 pencil at the end helps highlight the high points of the cable that would typically rub on things during the course of natural use; simulating raw, exposed metal where you would expect it."

modelmakers,3bncg2,oofficial,3,Tue Jun 30 16:34:24 2015 UTC,"The general idea for best work flow is to assemble as much as is possible before painting. Plastic cement works by destabilizing the plastic and melting it, when two parts are connected they are actually being melted together, not glued as most would think.  Paint getting in this process however does not melt and weakens the join greatly as it prevents a thorough weld. The ideal method is to create the largest assembly you can and then detail it out with a brush after you get the base coat down. This helps minimize the number of times you get cement. and paint together.   You can of course scrape away the paint in the area to be joined and hope that you don't remove too much or don't get too much cement that it flows out and touches the painted surfaces as it then requires touchups, etc.   Also painting larger assemblies, like two halves of a wing, sometimes results in a gap that is very noticeable. If you've already painted the two parts of the wing then filling that ruins any paintwork you've already done. This is applied to a lot of modeling, like joining turret parts together on a tank or body panels on a model car.   The vast majority of the time assembling and allowing to set before painting is much more sound than painting and hoping that you handling and gluing pre-painted parts doesn't absolutely ruin you hard work. (which it does if you're a fumble-fingers like me)  As a kid I worked this way.. Painting stuff on the sprue with completely un-thinned Testors enamel paints then rushing the assembly and getting finger prints and that super thick testors glue all over everything. The last time I assembled a car I was like 22, hadn't touched a model since I was maybe 14 and I realized how horrible my assembly process was, i tossed the kit and was honestly amazed that I assembled over a hundred kits this way and that they all looked really bad.. At the time I never honestly thought they looked bad but looking back.. jesus."
modelmakers,3bjxxp,windupmonkeys,2,Mon Jun 29 20:54:02 2015 UTC,"This is an old project I just took some photos of.   1/72 Revell Nashorn, painted in standard dunkelgelb with some preshading.   It's a bit shiny because I never bothered to apply a flat coat to it (I was still messing with the weathering and the like when I stopped working on it). Just taking some new photos of it since I saw it on a shelf and it'd been sitting there for a while gathering dust.   The book below it is Michael Rinaldi's Tankart 3 for modern armor, which I recently bought. It's a very good book. A bit expensive, but recommended.   The kit itself is very enjoyable to build, but is also very delicate, which for someone like me who prefers building, is actually preferable. Lots of very small parts that can easily be broken or damaged during removal from the sprues. The gun and tracks constitute the vast majority of the parts. The gun itself is probably a good third to a half of the full parts count of the kit; the  tracks are a mix of link and length, which were tedious to assemble but fit very well.  Yes, I am aware of the damage to the gun shields. I didn't realize just how thin they really were, so the flush cutter damaged them and I decided to leave them as is.   Washes are done with a mix of watercolors, and graphite from pencils. Colors used were raw umber, paynes gray, and occasionally, a touch of burnt sienna, but it's largely too bright to use.   Tracks are gunmetal with graphite highlights. I didn't put much rust or anything to them before stopping the project.   The wheels are a bit messier than I'd like, but this was an early attempt to try to use circle templates to paint road wheels. I was and remain less than impressed. It wasn't that much more convenient than painting it by hand, and the results were far less precise.   Paint order:    Tamiya Sky Grey primer coat.  NATO black preshading and shadowing.  Sand Yellow layer with 50% thinned paint.  Future Coat, then decals. The Solvaset reacted a bit with the future coat, causing some clouding, which was solved by spraying another coat of future after waiting a day for it to evaporate out a bit.  Second future coat.  Watercolor washes and graphite highlights. Silver drybrushing on the periscope."
modelmakers,3bk0o4,surprised_platypus,6,Mon Jun 29 21:14:53 2015 UTC,"Very nice work, especially for a first time build. Here's my feedback:   Where the Tamiya glue ate your paint: always sand the paint off after this happens. Attempting to just paint over it will leave an obvious rough texture. It's also always best to glue everything before painting, but I'm sure you realize this now. Where plastic oozed out of the seams: you are definitely using too much glue. Instead of applying directly from the bottle, take that toothpick and put a small dab on the tip. Don't line the entire fuselage with it, just pick key spots. Try to put tiny dabs of glue on opposite sides, rather than just to one side (remember, glue sticks best to itself, not plastic). You did a way better job with putty for your first time than me. Congrats. When you brushed the canopy lining: I would remember that masking tape isn't just for airbrushing. A quick mask job there would've made your brushing much cleaner. You did a great job cleaning up your mistakes on the bottom. Next time, after removing the paint with thinner, use wet sandpaper (make sure the paint is completely dry) and sand the paint off. This will hide mistakes much better. The paint chunk you refer to on the wing is most likely a dust particle or dandruff. This happens if you don't cover your model while it dries, or when you use too much paint. Excess paint is more likely to cause that, since dust particles are more apparently in it. I swear by always using primer. I prime all my parts, as I feel that's the best way to get an even, smooth paint job. I would recommend it next time for at least the body. You can never mask too much. It really sucks when you don't mask enough and make a mistake. Time and tape are cheap. The ""shine"" difference on your wings is probably because you sprayed one side with a thinner coat than the other. I've noticed that if you airbursh too much paint, even flat colors will take on a shine. I could be wrong about this though. Try giving them more coats next time, rather than using more paint. Don't use wood glue. Be gentle with the clear coat. Using too much at once will fuck up the entire model. Take your time, do nice thin coats.   Again, just outstanding work. It might seem like I'm criticising it a lot, but truthfully this looks better than most models I've made. I hope you had fun!"
modelmakers,3bk0o4,LOLtheism,3,Mon Jun 29 22:36:02 2015 UTC,"Wow, thanks a lot for the elaborate answer! I will definitely use primer on my next model and I'm mentally noting the sanding method for fixing mistakes.  Yeah I'll be really careful with the clear coat. How would you apply it? Put down a thin layer covering the whole model, then dry for a day, then put on another coat or do multiple passes while airbrushing only air in between passes? I'm using a german version of future floor polish.  Thanks a bunch for the help!"
modelmakers,3bk0o4,LOLtheism,3,Mon Jun 29 23:17:49 2015 UTC,"I would just do light passes with the future. I haven't airbrushed that yet, so I can't really speak to the best way to do it."
modelmakers,3bk0o4,XiaoGu,3,Mon Jun 29 23:30:01 2015 UTC,"For first build it is awesome, congratulations. As it was said here, first glue, then paint, also in general you have to use much more sandpaper, to remove all the unwanted glue. What i would also recommend for you is to start trying out shading.

Here are some pictures of the effect I think you're going for in 1/35:  http://www.amps-armor.org/ampssite/reviews/showReview.aspx?ID=126  If that's what you're doing, I think I'd make that with a sort of curved piece of tissue paper (not toilet paper or kleenex, which would fall apart pretty easily when dampened, but something like the kind of tissue paper you stick in gift bags when you're too lazy to wrap a present properly because you picked it up at Toys R Us on the way to a party for some kid in your son's class whose name you only know from the party invitation and who you wouldn't recognize if you met them outside of daycare.

modelmakers,3bl4bu,windupmonkeys,1 point,Tue Jun 30 04:21:42 2015 UTC,"You paint it after. It's not quite like paper mache, no. It's closer to a kind of ""glue/paper"" composite material, or a very primitive kind of ""plastic."" Mix the white glue and water at least 50-50, paint it over the paper. As it tries it'll harden into something stiffer than paper mache and then it can be painted, gloss coated, whatever.   You then cover with primer, then cover with paint, then cover with washes for shadows of your choice."
modelmakers,3bl4bu,captainwacky91,1 point,Tue Jun 30 03:21:18 2015 UTC,How would one make some fabric ripples... if you will.
modelmakers,3bl4bu,windupmonkeys,2,Tue Jun 30 03:59:46 2015 UTC,"Put some white glue on a piece of shaped tin foil, and glue your fabric analogue into said foil. Trim as needed, paint as needed.   Hopefully the foil won't look stiff (depending on the project, I guess), but will certainly be stiff enough for your needs.   If you want softly bending ripples, might I suggest bending the foil with a pen tube?  Edit: since this is for a gun mantlet, keep in mind that the typical kitchen grade foil will likely be too thick. Get some chewing gum and save the foil wrappers."
modelmakers,3bl4bu,windupmonkeys,1 point,Wed Jul 1 22:56:05 2015 UTC,"Depends on the size. For major creases like you see in a mantlet, probably just any kind of probe like a toothpick strategically dragged across the surface making indentations similar to the reference photos you have available.   It's part of the reason why I'd do it in poster putty in 1/72. Trying to sculpt a mass of glue soaked paper is not exactly a race against time, but it means that if you don't get it right, you can't rework it after it dries, unless you soak it in more water, or add more layers. While the resulting mantlet canvas cover would never set, I also have infinite reworkability until I am happy with it, after which I leave it alone. The suggestions by everyone else offer a second alternative, which is to get the favorable working properties of the epoxy putty (i.e. it's like clay, work it as such to include the folds you're looking for), and then it'll set on its own, permanently fixing the result.  Out of the three, if you want a permanent result the best bet is probably an epoxy putty of some kind."
modelmakers,3bl4bu,windupmonkeys,1 point,Tue Jun 30 04:10:30 2015 UTC,"Also, looking at the size of what you're trying to do (I googled a Firefly mantlet), you're probably better off using a putty or similar. However, it's a close call because if you are building in 1/72 scale, it might be small enough for a paper construction to be self supporting. I'd change the glue ratio to something with more glue and less water though."
modelmakers,3bl4bu,windupmonkeys,2,Tue Jun 30 04:20:46 2015 UTC,"Tissue paper soaked in white/PVA glue and the paint of your choice, or, poster putty to fill in the mantlet, sculpted with folds and painted.   The latter will never set and will remain flexible.   Or, Das Pronto/Sculpey/air dry clay that does not shrink. Same principles apply."
modelmakers,3bmgnm,txbob22,1 point,Tue Jun 30 12:14:51 2015 UTC,"You will want to use a gloss or satin clear coat. If the surface is matte you will have all sorts of problems with it.  Odourless turpentine is not as harsh as White Spirit, the processing that makes it odourless removes some of it's ""solventability"". So a quality acrylic clear coat should be just fine.   Now, the oil paint. Quality oil paint is kinda transparent but rich in pigment (yes, there is really opaque oil paint too). So you put it on the model and then massage it to the finish you want with a dry brush. Depending on how long you wait before putting it on and ""massaging"" it will be more or less easy to push around.  I usually (when painting models & miniatures) dilute it with odourless turpentine so it flows from the bristles of the brush without too much work. The consistency I like to use is like warm butter. Put it on where I want it, dont worry much about how it looks, let it sit for 20 minutes, then take a clean flat brush and start massaging the oil paint, feathering it out etc.  The ""magic"" thing with oils is that there is no binder, so it never really dries and gets permanent. So you can work with it for a long time (until the linseed oil evaporates more or less), and if you dont like how it turns out, just wipe it away with something moistened with turpentine. This also makes it essential that you, once you're done, seal it with a clear coat. Especially if you're going to do further work with oil paint, enamels or pigments on top of it.  Oil paint dries slow, and the hue can change a little when ""wet"", so I usually wait a day or so before deciding if I can seal it up.  Also use a tile or some flat palette, and a palette knife to mix your paint. You'll quickly ruin a hobby brush if you use it to mix paint (brushes for oil paint is usually made with much stiffer bristles)."

modelmakers,3bmgnm,Gewehr43,1 point,Tue Jun 30 13:26:47 2015 UTC,Absolutely.  Don't just buy the gallon jug of turpentine from your local hardware store.  It smells horrific and will eat thru just about anything you put it on.  It's much too hot for model use.  I used this on my Panther G recently and it seemed to work well.

modelmakers,3bmgnm,solipsistnation,1 point,Tue Jun 30 18:42:00 2015 UTC,"I watched a Michael Rinaldi video and he puts his oils down on a piece of cardboard rather than a palette-- it sucks most of the oil out of the paint so it's a little less blobby to work with. I usually end up putting on little dabs of paint with a smaller brush and then working it with an angled brush lightly dampened with turpenoid, and I find that easier than it was before I used the cardboard."
modelmakers,3bmgnm,pxpxpx,2,Tue Jun 30 16:44:13 2015 UTC,"Yeah, paper palettes are good if you don't plan on mixing too much. But on the other hand you lose the ""warm butter"" consistency pretty quick and sometimes you introduce fibres from the cardboard / paper.

You can use turpentine to thin it down. Oil can also give 3D effects once it's dry. Thin it too much and it will ruin everything. Too little and paint won't stick or you'll put too much in one stroke.

There isn't. There is no simple strict formula that is used in every case. For some people, maybe there is. But my experience says that that's not the case, and asking for the exact step by step breakdown each time you want to solve a particular modeling problem is not going to provide you with a consistent solution. They are merely guidelines.    Much of this is trial and error, and then whatever experience that you pick up while you're doing it."

modelmakers,3bhajf,frugm1,1 point,Mon Jun 29 19:27:49 2015 UTC,"Gunmetal for WWII era, unless there is an intention to weather to incorporate mud, heavy mud, snow, etc. I happen to think many models unless situated in a diorama are too heavily weathered (in the tracks) so I generally leave it to look somewhat worn, but also not coated in mud.   Nato black/gunmetal highlights for modern era tracks, again subject to exceptions for rust, heavy mud, snow. Nato black for the track pads, gunmetal/jetexhaust/steel for the linkages. Guide horns and the like in modern armor, if not in muddy situations or heavily worn, also in gunmetal. Grayish wash occasionally used for worn rubber patterns, but easily overdone.   Rinaldi in Tankart 3 (whose talents are far beyond anything I can do at the moment or have inclination to do), one example:  Dark steel/gray mix, followed by heavily thinned rust colored paint, randomly applied via a sponge. ""Planned"" randomness is useful. Looking too uniform becomes very obvious.   It looks very good.   As for me:   Wash on completed track sections and road wheels is typically a mud/sludge wash of payne's gray/raw umber watercolors. Sludge/gray washes are also used to highlight road wheel hubcaps, etc.   Pigments are ground up pastels, largely of the same shades with some variations mixed in.   Some highlights, esp for WWII models (also used occasionally on gunbarrels and gunmetal surfaces) are ground up graphite from pencils, and occasionally, directly applied by rubbing the tip of the pencil against wear areas.   My armor models tend to be lightly weathered, and I don't slather on the pigments and oil stains.   Washes typically used include:   Mix of Payne's Gray/Raw Umber into a mud-like color, which is a subjective, case by case determination. Some rust-colored drybrushing, but rare, and almost always in reference to a reference photo."
modelmakers,3bhajf,windupmonkeys,0,Mon Jun 29 05:51:10 2015 UTC,"Now what type of gunmetal are we talking about?  True Gunmetal that looks more like a purplish metalic black, or a dark grey metalic silver?"
modelmakers,3bhajf,windupmonkeys,1 point,Mon Jun 29 06:27:49 2015 UTC,"Metallic silver.   Highlights are done in graphite powder from ground up pencils. Dark tones are done with black washes where needed, or drybrushed dark colors. If gunmetal doesn't look right, I do a second coat with some black mixed in.   The alternative is to do the opposite: paint tracks a rubber/NATO black, then use a wash of gunmetal or drybrush gunmetal (metallic silver) to bring out the guide horns, or the linkages.   However, this is all for relatively clean models. I don't prefer weathering my subjects up to the eyeballs.   Essentially, the effect I usually go for is something like this:   http://static4.depositphotos.com/1002772/313/i/950/depositphotos_3139096-Tank-tracks.jpg  I usually don't go much further than some rust/mud color for the track pins/links and things like that, then handpaint the modern tracks with rubber pads NATO black, and if I am really feeling like wearing it down some, a touch of neutral or sky gray into the mix.   I tend to not apply much more wear than this:   https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/24/Leopard_2_A5_der_Bundeswehr.jpg  http://www.kampfpanzer.de/image/detail/leo2a6_3.jpg  This is largely because I don't put my models in dioramas so having it completely splashed in mud and grease in the middle of a display case (or whatever) doesn't make a whole lot of sense. However, if I were to do that, I'd use a mix of washes, oil washes, then some pigments for good measure, as well as some thinned mud/dust colors sprayed into the running gear and tracks, as well as along the sides.   To a certain extent, there is just no hard and fast rule about this, at least in my case. It really is a question of ""what looks right"" or ""what does the reference photo show."" One of the main things to keep in mind is very simply that shadows and dark areas on scale models simply do not work the way their real life counterparts do, which is why washes, shading,  etc, makes a difference or creates visual appeal because you're ""replacing"" what lighting effects the real machine has that can't be seen on a scale model unless highlighted, emphasized, or darkened to suit."

I haven't checked for accuracy of the model since I didn't have any drawings and only few photographs on the web (the tank at Bovington seems to be an Mk. I which has some different details to it). Fit was pretty good altogether. Especially the main hull components fit snugly.   Some hints though:  First off the lower hull bow plate A18 has two slits to fit the diagonal mudguard struts. Those slits are 1mm to far outward. So you should fill and sand these before fixing the plate to the hull. The corresponding tongues on the struts you can snap off.  Piece A42 is actually B 42.  Rear plate A29 needs to be sanded 0,5mm on the sides to fit into the hull.  Lifting hooks C8 go on the back of the commanders cupola (missing from the instructions).  Parts C7 are the taillights which are also missing in the instructions.  The metal tow wires are shitty IMHO, since they are very springy and can't be bent in shape (perhaps I'll replace them with self made ones).  The decals have individual letters for the license plates (don't quite get the point of that).  The box states on it's CAD pictures it had a ""one piece gun barrel"". Flat out lie.

It lies along the A487 road, on the eastern shore of the Menai Strait, opposite the Isle of Anglesey.

Carnarvon and Caernarvon are Anglicised spellings that were superseded in 1926 and 1974 respectively.  Abundant natural resources in and around the Menai Straits enabled human habitation in the area during prehistory. The Ordovices, a Celtic tribe, lived in the region during classical antiquity. The Roman fort Segontium was established around AD 80 to subjugate the Ordovices during the Roman conquest of Britain. The Romans and occupied the region until their departure in the 5th century, after which Caernarfon became part of the Kingdom of Gwynedd. In the late 11th century, William the Conqueror ordered the construction of a motte at Caernarfon, as part of an attempt at conquering the region.

modelmakers,3bfdxd,zerogee616,2,Sun Jun 28 19:02:15 2015 UTC,A few ideas: -Are you screwing the tops on tight? -Are you keeping the cardboard circle in the cap (needed for a tight seal) -Are you storing them in a cool place (no heat)
modelmakers,3bfdxd,Tbone65,1 point,Sun Jun 28 20:58:39 2015 UTC,"I am, for the Model Masters. Tamiya doesn't have those caps. I'm keeping them in my house, about 75 degrees. This doesn't happen with my acrylic Vallejo and Citadel paints."
modelmakers,3bfdxd,solipsistnation,1 point,Sun Jun 28 21:47:31 2015 UTC,"Tamiya has those sort of plastic seal things on the inside of the lid-- basically, you don't take anything out of the lid when you open them, right? (I don't know why you would, but still.)  What if you keep them inside a plastic bag?"
modelmakers,3bfdxd,ionizzatore,1 point,Mon Jun 29 22:20:54 2015 UTC,"No Tamiya can I've seen has those, at least not the ones that come out. I know MM does, as I used to be an idiot and throw those away, but I since learned."
modelmakers,3bfdxd,ionizzatore,2,Mon Jun 29 22:45:06 2015 UTC,The only logical explanation is that the bottle is not sealed correctly.  Is the thread of the jar clean? How and where do you store the paints?
modelmakers,3bfdxd,Hadramal,1 point,Sun Jun 28 21:03:00 2015 UTC,"I keep them in a paints box in my workshop, just a room in my place. About 75-80 degrees.  It only happens with those kinds of paints, not my acrylic water-based ones."
modelmakers,3bcmtk,Natemac775,6,Sat Jun 27 23:16:48 2015 UTC,Is that a Patton? It looks really good for a first build. More pictures would be helpful for more criticism though :)
modelmakers,3bcmtk,LOLtheism,3,Sat Jun 27 23:43:04 2015 UTC,"It is a Patton! The Monogram M48 A2 to be more specific, an old cast for sure as it seemed to need lots of seam patches! And a couple more pictures of it here http://imgur.com/a/6xx6s"
modelmakers,3bcmtk,solipsistnation,3,Sun Jun 28 00:20:04 2015 UTC,"Tracks are on backwards! 8)  Not bad, though-- I'd say that's a pretty bad kit, but you managed to get it looking pretty decent. (Signs of an old kit: turret grab irons rendered as ridges instead of separate pieces.)  So what all did you do to paint and finish it? Looks like some kind of wash, and some decent detail painting on the tools and stuff. Looks like you didn't try to do anything with the tracks, too, and I don't blame you-- that kit is old enough that I bet they're made of something that actively repels paint...   Not a bad start, anyway! What's next?"
modelmakers,3bcmtk,solipsistnation,2,Sun Jun 28 03:05:59 2015 UTC,"I don't have an airbrush so that's all shaker can OD and I made up my own was with oil paint and thinner.

modelmakers,3bcmtk,Camarupim,4,Sun Jun 28 03:32:07 2015 UTC,"Hey, rattlecan OD is just fine. 8) Coverage is good and everything.

modelmakers,3bcmtk,Rocat,2,Sun Jun 28 20:45:28 2015 UTC,"Oh cool. Yeah, that should be a little more challenging than an old Monogram kit."
modelmakers,3bcmtk,Camarupim,3,Sun Jun 28 04:31:21 2015 UTC,"The paint looks good, especially considering that its your first model. Just make sure you give the sprues a good wash before you start building, and the model itself before you paint; the mould release agents and dust which builds up can ruin the finish."
modelmakers,3bcmtk,frugm1,2,Sun Jun 28 12:06:46 2015 UTC,"I like it...fellow modellers already pointed out at some points which could be improved...I would start another kit, keeping in mind what they wrote. You had a good start, you will improve fast! Have fun."
modelmakers,3bcmtk,RUNUKEM,2,Sun Jun 28 09:04:22 2015 UTC,"It's a little hard to tell from the photos, but your wash seems to have taken well - the tank looks suitably grubby with oil stains. It also looks like you've got some wear on the exposed edges - pencil lead? Tracks are always difficult to weather, but old vinyl tracks especially so. The surface seem slightly shiny in places, but that might be a product of the lighting you've used for tech photographs.  All round great work for a first effort."
modelmakers,3bcmtk,uggmun,2,Sun Jun 28 13:22:58 2015 UTC,"Not to bad for a first attempt. I'm looking at getting an M48 for a Vietnam diorama I want to build. I was looking at this and the Tamiya version. Both have there flaws, being older kits. Looks like you have handled it pretty well though.  I don't like that all the detail is molded on the monogram kit though. Nice work keep it up."

I've pretty new to model making. I haven't learned weathering or proper painting to this extent. I really got into it so that I can make something this someday. I'm not going as how you did it, you have great descriptions and I know the basic answer is time, practice, and a lot of patients. In any case great job."

I have this kit and I'm just gonna toss it in the trash instead of building it cause of you.  Thats fantastic looking! I'm a huge AC fan and own every single game from the series that was released in the US, even the terrible PSP game.. I don't even own a PSP anymore lol. You totally owned it!  I've looked everywhere and I cannot find those decal packs, can you pretty please provide a link to where you buy them at? I tried HLJ but they are perpetually out of stock. I've not found any other sources for them, ebay, etc. I have a few Gunpla kits and like 4 Armored core kits.. well 3 now because of you that I'd like to have some of these for.   Does anyone else not have an option to downvote posts anymore? Like I can downvote comments but not the actual posts.. In this case it's not a bad thing since I could never bring myself to downvote it but you know, I like having options."
modelmakers,3bbb1p,HandBanaba,3,Sat Jun 27 19:16:14 2015 UTC,"Hey there!   First off thank you for your kind words! I'm super happy you like my kit!  As for decals, I've used Modelkasten Multipurpose Caution Decals (white), which are now rare and hard to find. I got mine on Hobbysearch about 9 months ago. The other sheets are NC decals (set 05, 1/144 white) made by HiQ Parts. The 05 set is now rare as well, even on hobbysearch, but they recently released set 07 and it looks fantastic. They periodically restock as well, so set 07 should be your best call. I strongly recommend the HiQ decals, they are hands down the most wonderful decals I have worked with.  Best of luck my friend!"
modelmakers,3bbb1p,HandBanaba,3,Sun Jun 28 01:21:40 2015 UTC,This Friday I'm going to place a huge order for several of these decal sets! I never thought this site sold model stuff!

modelmakers,3bcvzw,gabeh2000,4,Sun Jun 28 00:48:22 2015 UTC,"Tanks, aircraft, ships, cars, motorcycles, gundams, wargaming figures, lego, matchsticks and figures. I don't discriminate. If it is plastic, resin, wood or metal and comes in many pieces that need assembling then I'm probably going to get it. If a kit catches my eye because of the way it looks, the history of the subject or hell sometimes it's purely because of the challenge of it then I'm going to buy it eventually. Then I will carefully start removing and cleaning pieces to begin assembly until the next new shiny arrives and gets placed on top of it. When the stack gets too big to work around I move those to the In Progress shelf so I have room to start work on the next new one."

modelmakers,3bcvzw,solipsistnation,3,Mon Jun 29 01:41:12 2015 UTC,"ALL the things.   Statistically you'll see aircraft from me more often, but I build anything. Planes, ships, cars, tanks, rockets, model locomotives (working or otherwise), sci fi, you name it, I'll probably consider it.   The only ones I don't really like are anatomical models or similar."
modelmakers,3bcvzw,windupmonkeys,3,Sun Jun 28 04:42:12 2015 UTC,i used to do a lot of planes (1/72 and sometimes 1/48) but recently i've been getting more into ships (1/700). the difference is thatships require more time and a differnt type of skills.  but all of my models (so far) are from the WWII era.  with most of the ships from the IJN
modelmakers,3bcvzw,corosuske,3,Sun Jun 28 12:09:06 2015 UTC,"I've done a couple dozen cars, a few ships, a few modern day fighters, and a few helicopters, but my mainstay is WWII aircraft, almost exclusively in 1:72 scale.  Every so often I'll pop up something out of that realm, though. I recently picked up two 1:48 kits - an F-105 and an A-6. On the odd occasions I build Vietnam-era planes, I typically do them in 1:48. It'll probably be quite some time before I get to them, though - I've got some other kits I'm really excited to get to beforehand. And the one I'm working on right now is going to take... some time."
modelmakers,3bcvzw,flounderflound,3,Sun Jun 28 14:14:09 2015 UTC,"I had completely lost interest in the hobby for over a decade but stumbled across a website where someone had built Tamiya's 1/32 birdcage Corsair. It sparked an interest in me that grew  for several months, then I just gave in. I've been almost obsessing over WWII aircraft since then. I've built a Corsair, two Thunderbolts, working on a Lightning, have a Mustang ready to go, and another Corsair, Thunderbolt and Lightening ready to build. It's amazing how much better kits, accessories and tools have gotten since I built models in the late 80's to mid 90's. 1/48 is my preferred scale. It's big enough to show detail but small enough to not take up too much space.  I'm going to try Tamiya's 1/32 Corsair this winter, and have my eyes on 1/48 Tamiya Spitfire, Academy P-40, and Revell's tried but true B-25J."
modelmakers,3bcvzw,Fortunate_0ne,3,Sun Jun 28 15:54:48 2015 UTC,Mainly planes which are mostly WWII (all in 1/48 scale) but I wouldn't mind getting into other things as long as they are in the same scale. I just like to keep things consistent....
modelmakers,3bcvzw,TheWharf1,3,Sun Jun 28 16:39:42 2015 UTC,Ships.  You can spend nearly twice the amount of money on detail parts than the kit costs.

modelmakers,3bcvzw,Flynn_lives,3,Mon Jun 29 05:55:37 2015 UTC,Armour. I do planes sometimes as well but I have a love of tanks. Everything I do is military as of yet and it always has been but tanks hold a special place in my heart. I often find myself way too critical of myself while painting planes as in my mind I see them as very neat and Sleak things where as tanks are rough and ready and I can relax a bit with the paint job. That being said I love my 1 72 spit I did a while ago and I have a 1 72 mustang and hurricane and a 1 24 hurricane in my little stash.  Even though I've barley started the big hurricane I'm pausing on it until I know I'll be able to do it damn near as I can perfectly.  I kit that great deserves to be something special.
modelmakers,3bcvzw,Gingerbread95,2,Sun Jun 28 18:43:33 2015 UTC,"Ships, preferably in 1/350th scale. I've made a few armour models and while they're fun and easy, nothing is as satisfying as putting the last prop on a massive ship model that just consumed 2 years of your life and had you begging for mercy. Build what ever floats your boat."

modelmakers,3bcvzw,flounderflound,2,Mon Jun 29 13:30:41 2015 UTC,"I generally like tanks the most. Haven't really done much else recently.   Of course most of the tanks I build are wargaming pieces, not sure if that counts round here.   I do have a fairly good stock of bigger models too, ready for me to maybe get to them one day. I think the only ones that aren't a tank of some sort are a Spitfire and Deep Space Nine from Star trek."

modelmakers,3bb6i9,2oonhed,2,Tue Jun 30 04:14:55 2015 UTC,"Best analogy is it's like a spray-on or brush-on putty. Softer than paint so it sands real nice. If you are going to fill & block sand or contour sand, the best way to spot low spots and other imperfections is to dry guide the surfacer before sanding. By that I mean, using a light colored surfacer, (grey or white) after it's dried enough to be sandable, rub some black chalk dust on there either with a soft cloth, sponge, or your finker. Look up Gunze Sangyo Mr. Surfacer and read."

As for weathering, most of it is just dot filters using various shades of artist oils, but I also applied a very thin tan filter over the upper surfaces and some pastels in a number of places (e.g., the wheels and wheel wells). For the panel lines I used the artist oils in a manner similar to the dot filters rather than doing a pin wash. All of this was over a satin finish (since late war Corsairs were glossy sea blue all over) which lets you play around with the oils a bit more and blend them a bit better than if you're working over a matte coat, as I have subsequently discovered on more recent projects. Also, I didn't put another clear coat on top of this weathering, partly b/c I don't have an airbrush and brushing on clear coats is a pain and partly b/c I really like the different levels of reflectivity it has right now (which unfortunately doesn't translate into my photos as much as I would have hoped)."

One thing I will say though is that I would recommend washing it off with some warm soapy water before using it. I've found that fresh out of the package, it has left-over manufacturing oils which will absorb into the paint of your model."
modelmakers,3b6v9s,FlyingSMonster,2,Fri Jun 26 19:00:40 2015 UTC,can anyone explain the difference between silly putty and adhesive tact?
modelmakers,3b6v9s,OmniNoc,2,Fri Jun 26 15:12:29 2015 UTC,"I think you mean blue tack (adhesive tack). It's a different animal; it's some sort of rubber (exact composition is secret). Silly putty is a silicate, which acts as a non-Newtonian fluid. Both are good for masking, but the fluidity of silly putty makes it a better option in my opinion."
modelmakers,3b6v9s,OmniNoc,2,Fri Jun 26 15:18:03 2015 UTC,"Ah, I see. another question, is this also using silly putty? (Skirt and feet part). Do you know any tutorial for it? I don't know where to find since I don't know what it called. Sorry if I'm asking too much. I never remodel my kit since I straight build all the time."
modelmakers,3b6v9s,pxpxpx,2,Sat Jun 27 14:09:55 2015 UTC,"No worries about the questions. But I don't think it is. I think it's not a masking putty there, but something that's sculpted onto the model. Green stuff, milliput and similar two-component epoxy putties can do that."
modelmakers,3b6v9s,Flabergie,2,Sat Jun 27 16:12:44 2015 UTC,Silly Putty is easier to remove and doesn't leave residue once you remove it. It's also pretty cool to play around with! :)
modelmakers,3b6v9s,Cookiescool2,2,Sat Jun 27 12:53:34 2015 UTC,I use Silly Putty for masking windshields on 1/72 vehicles and helicopters.

modelmakers,3b5gts,holocause,2,Fri Jun 26 16:49:07 2015 UTC,You have to prime the kit if you plan to do a repaint. The black solar panel in the Bandai Tie is not made of polystyrene but the more malleable abs formula that Bandai uses in their MG and PG innerframe plastics for gunpla. Someone at /r/SciFiModels skipped this part and went straight to topcoating and the varnish reacted negatively to the bare abs plastic.
modelmakers,3b778x,Medjoe,3,Fri Jun 26 15:02:37 2015 UTC,"Brushing sealer. I have been using Duncan Matte Sealer over my painted surfaces before applying decals. I tend to apply a generous layer with the brush and take long strokes to even it out. However, on the first project that I did using this method (a Macchi 202), I had some silvering problems with one of the larger roundels, and the other one on the opposite wing had no issue. I do use Micro Sol/Set for every decal, so the silvering couldn't have been from that.  Fast forward to my current build, an AS332 Super Puma. I sanded the paint smooth with 2000 grit to provide a better surface for the decals, then applied the sealer. On closer inspection, I see some brush marks and the surface is not as smooth. To correct this, I did very fine overall sanding again, and now I'm waiting a little before applying the decals. Is this a common occurrence with sealing the paint?"
modelmakers,3b778x,IxI_DUCK_IxI,3,Fri Jun 26 16:34:10 2015 UTC,"Silvering is usually caused by air being trapped under the decal.  This can happen with a matte finish since a matte finish is usually more rough than a glossy coat.    You can prepare the area with Microsol or Microset which should allow the decal to adhere properly.  If you notice any silvering after that you can poke the area with the tip of a pin to let the air out.  If you're getting silvering after the model has been completed for awhile and you're having the aged decal silvering issue, this guy has a good article to explain and combat it:  http://www.ipmsstockholm.org/magazine/2006/10/stuff_eng_benshahar_bf110.htm"
modelmakers,3b778x,Medjoe,1 point,Fri Jun 26 18:05:00 2015 UTC,"Thank you, that was a good read. Thankfully my models aren't that old... yet :) . Regarding Micro Set/Sol, I'll be a bit more careful with their application, namely on getting the first coat of Sol properly and poking eventual air pockets. I was reluctant on doing that because I feared that I might damage the decal, but I'll give it a try. Besides, gotta start somewhere..."
modelmakers,3b778x,windupmonkeys,2,Fri Jun 26 19:33:39 2015 UTC,"Never apply decals over a matte surface if you want to avoid silvering.   Decals are best applied on top of a gloss coating, not a matte one. The matte goes on after you finish decaling.   Microsol and set will do nothing to cause silvering. It's very simply that you're using a matte coating when you should be using a glossy one.   Sanding it with 2000 grit will lower the chances of it becoming silvered because you're smoothing out the rough texture that causes the matte finish anyway.   Is it possible to apply decals onto a matte coat, use sol, and still get a non-silvered decal? Yes. Is it much more likely that your decal will silver compared to a gloss surface? Yes.   To further press out air bubbles, use a cotton swab, or shirt and press down on the decal. Be careful with small decals that haven't adhered yet, you can take them right off.   Further, use some water or set painted to the model just before you drop down the decal. Then use a tissue, after final positioning, touch a corner of the tissue to the puddle of liquid around the decal. It'll wick it up. Don't do this with future, however, or you'll leave paper fibers.   Stop decaling and pick up a can of spray gloss, or at the very least, use some future floor polish painted on the area where you will install the decal before applying the decal. If you use future, however, you have a limited amount of working time before the Future polish starts to get sticky. Apply a bit more future in that case, but work quickly."
modelmakers,3b778x,Medjoe,2,Sat Jun 27 00:09:42 2015 UTC,"Huh, I was under the impression that Micro Set does help a little by creating a smoother surface, I know that it certainly helps moving the decal around (matte colours, that's military camo for ya :) ). Regarding the application, I use a cotton swab after I place the decal to wipe the Set and excess water, then once more after each pass of Sol.   Most of the time it hasn't been a problem, except for some odd places, and what prompted my initial questioning was noticing the very small brush marks on the surface, after I did some sanding of the paint. I'll look into getting some 3k and 4k grit (and see around for a better sealer, but this one feels alright, maybe I lack a comparison), and more depending on what the shops nearby stock for cars, because I found 2000 grit a bit too much. When I sanded I scraped some paint off a few times, and I'll do even lighter passes. I waited about 1 hour or more before doing any of the buffing, maybe waiting even more for the paint to cure would help... I haven't invested yet in some primer, and that may be the solution to that issue, as I suspect that paint hasn't fully adhered to the plastic, but resources for more tools are rather thin at the moment.   I'm reluctant to sand the plastic before painting to somewhat simulate a primer, do you have any experience with this?  I have two fighters (IAR 80 and Mig 21) on which I'll try using finer grit if I find it, since I won't be able to start building again for another while, and now I'm definitely intrigued by applying the decal before the matte coat."
modelmakers,3b778x,windupmonkeys,2,Sat Jun 27 00:58:28 2015 UTC,"There is a simple solution to all this.   Make sure (1) your paintjob isn't too rough. If it's too rough, sand it down as you said, using the higher grits as mentioned. You can even polish with a bit of toothpaste on a rag, taking care not to burn through the paint.   Micro set is supposed to help it lay down flat, yes, but on a glossy surface, it's even better.   Microl SOL is a solvent that is designed basically, for better or worse, to melt your decal straight onto the surface, to make it snuggle into the panel lines, etc, etc. If you ever see a decal that is between a panel line, and you see it fully  recessed and wonder ""how did they do that"" the answer is almost certainly MicroSol, Solvaset, or any number of decal setting solutions.   MicroSet is more of a surface preparation, which frankly, I bought a bottle once, but I never use. I instead prepare a gloss surface using gloss clear paint, or future, and then decal on top of it.   ideally, the surface should be shiny and glass smooth, but it doesn't have to be.   Decal quality also varies by kit. The best decals are generally italian made, and even better if they're from Cartograph, a particular company well known for making high quality, easy to work with decals.   You can keep sanding and polishing, and it will help. But a gloss coat will be an easier solution, as long as you weren't too rough with your initial color paintwork.   Then, the simple solution: spray a gloss coat, wait to dry, or use future floor polish as your ""micro set"" before placing the decal.  Micro sol DOES help, but you're missing the point. The reason why you have silvering problems on a matte finish is because the paint (if you magnify it with a microscope or magnifying glass) is because the texture is not nearly as smooth as a good gloss paint would have on it.    Everything everyone else said so far about air bubbles is sound. The reason why decals silver is because there are microbubbles trapped underneath the decal. Set is supposed to help probably break surface tension and try to ""suck in"" the decals to the microbubbles. However, think about it. What's easier to do? Doing that to a smooth surface, or a micro-pebbly one made by the matte paint/sealer? Sol, when applied after the decal is placed, will also help it conform and partially deals with the problem, but it won't ""push out"" air bubbles that are already trapped there.  Sol should generally be applied only after the decal has been placed in final position. There's a reason for this. Once you put on sol, you should not move the decal at all, and it might even wrinkle as it's drying. The wrinkles will almost always settle themselves out as the decal gets more tightly pasted to the surface. Touch that decal, and it might disintegrate, turn into a melted mess, or what have you.  If you ever have a chance, compare the dried texture of matte paint versus gloss paint. You'll notice a very distinct difference. One will be ""rougher"" than the other."
modelmakers,3b778x,windupmonkeys,2,Sat Jun 27 01:03:53 2015 UTC,"If anyone else does differently, please do chime in. I am not saying my method is best, but that's the one generally recommended as far as I know, and it's the one I use.   My bottle of set hasn't left the shelf in a few years.   The order I use is this:    Build the kit, prepaint whatever parts you like.  Prime the model, usually with Tamiya sky gray because i use acrylic paints, fill, sand, etc.  Apply preshading, if needed.  Apply the base color coat.  Postshade, if you wish.  Polish if the paint is rough, but this is super rare.  GLOSS COAT. I use future floor polish, but acceptable alternatives are spray  gloss coatings, gloss varnish, etc. Wait for the coating to dry. Decal. Use either future, or microset (if you want) as  the surface preparation, then after decaling, hit the decals with Solvaset or MicroSol. After the decals have dried, use a brush and water to remove the decal setting solution residue.  FLAT COAT, this is where your matte coating would matter. Sometimes, prior to this coat I also use another coat of gloss or future to help blend the surface together a bit. Weather.  Seal with another flat coat if I want it."
modelmakers,3b778x,Medjoe,2,Sat Jun 27 01:08:46 2015 UTC,"Thanks, the list really helps clarify your method! I don't recall exactly where I read it, but using a combination of coats (gloss and matte), the effects of the original colour are diminished/enhanced, i.e. matte coat dulls glossy paint, etc. If using both a coat of gloss and matte later, what is the effect on the colour afterwards? Do the two nullify each other?   And another question regarding primer, if there are gaps and seams to be filled, do those have priority over the primer, i.e. filling the fuselage halves' seams, or does having multiple layers of primer in some spots having a negligible effect? I'm not savvy on how thick a primer coat can be, to conserve the existing nearby panel lines."
modelmakers,3b778x,windupmonkeys,3,Sat Jun 27 02:05:43 2015 UTC,"Fill gaps and seams, then shoot primer. The primer coat will then alert you to any remaining imperfections and seam lines. Fix those, resand, then reprime.   It may well be the case, yes, that multiple coats of gloss and matte do affect the color a bit, but I find that the effect is small enough not to worry about, and worst case, some people account for this by either using slightly darker or lighter paint (i.e. mixing in a touch of white or whatever). I personally find that the effect is nearly nil, so I don't bother with it, I just gloss then decal then flat, and it looks fine. The only tonal variations I would use is for preshading and postshading, or to introduce shadows into corners and things like that.   And yes, they do take priority because you're likely to just sand off the primer anyway when you're done filling and sanding the gaps.   I don't actually use real primer. I use XF-19 sky gray because I find it to be easy to spray and work with, and I know that the paint I'm likely to use (Model master acrylic) will adhere to that without lifting when I mask complex patterns.   Primer is best sprayed, or done with a paint that is very good for brushing purposes."
modelmakers,3b778x,surprised_platypus,3,Sat Jun 27 02:11:47 2015 UTC,How do I mask a cockpit (before painting the fuselage) with weird edges without gluing the canopy on first? Did a closed cockpit-canopy on my Zero but how would I mask if I wanted an open one?  The edges of the cockpit were to thin for the masking tape to sick properly.
modelmakers,3b778x,Dr_Von_Spaceman,3,Fri Jun 26 17:31:40 2015 UTC,"I just stuff a small piece of paper towel into the open cockpit. Use a toothpick to get it down below the lip of the fuselage. Use additional pieces of paper towel if the first one wasn't enough. Just be careful to not damage any details, but you don't have to fill the entire cockpit - just enough to cover the opening."

modelmakers,3b778x,surprised_platypus,3,Fri Jun 26 17:57:10 2015 UTC,okay so I would use liquid mask for the edges and fill up the rest of the cockpit with masking tape and paper underneath?
modelmakers,3b778x,ionizzatore,1 point,Fri Jun 26 19:56:06 2015 UTC,"Yup.  I prefer to use only masking tape whenever possible. It's easier to do in most wwii planes since the higher part of the seat is usually under the level of the canopy, a piece of tape on the front part of the canopy (vertically) and a piece of tape on the cockpit (that's what i did on my Yak-3).  There are also more creative ways to do this. For example you can use some tiny drop of liquid masking to ""kind-of-glue"" the canopy in place, then you'll just need to remove the canopy and place it open once finished (that's what i did on my Intruder)"

modelmakers,3b7j9w,rangamatchstick,3,Fri Jun 26 16:31:54 2015 UTC,"Sounds like either your regulator or the pressure valve on the airbrush is bad. Regulators are like 30 bucks, I think..."
modelmakers,3b7j9w,solipsistnation,3,Fri Jun 26 17:29:43 2015 UTC,probably need to disclose your compressor model and setup before anyone can really help
modelmakers,3b7j9w,partygoat,3,Fri Jun 26 18:24:26 2015 UTC,"I suspect your tank is too small, or you need a tank between the compressor and airbrush. I'm assuming it's actually a pulsing issue (varying, rhythmic changes in pressure) and not just a single extra squirt of air.  The compressor, depending on type, will usually make pulses of air that have to be smoothed out before they get to the airbrush- this is where the tank comes in, it gets fed in pulses but feeds the air smoothly. If the tank is too small, the pulses get through.  It's hard for a change in air pressure to be caused by the airbrush- it's more likely the compressor.  Either way, a thorough strip, clean and lube of the airbrush is a good starting point for any airbrush troubleshooting.  This should include disassembly of the air valve and reassembling with a bit of silicone lube, and checking the air seal at the nozzle-body connection. Nozzles wear out and eventually need replacement. Check the seal by putting a bit of water, or soapy water, on the outside of the air cap to make sure no air is escaping here."
modelmakers,3b7j9w,llordlloyd,2,Fri Jun 26 23:53:22 2015 UTC,"Its not pulsing, it will be at the right pressure for a few seconds than it just cranks up, works faster and puts out alot more pressure from that point on. Where would be the best place to get an extra tank? My LHS doesnt have any at the moment."
modelmakers,3b7j9w,llordlloyd,2,Sat Jun 27 01:53:14 2015 UTC,"Might not be a tank issue then. Industrial air supply shops should be able to help you. A tank is in essence very simple, just a sealed steel cylinder with threaded holes for the pneumatic fittings. Do you have a regulator? That's an air valve at the compressor end of your air line, which you can use to adjust the output of the compressor (or tank). Big hardware stores sell these. I would try that before a tank."

modelmakers,3b6r3n,Destructias_Warlord,3,Fri Jun 26 12:59:51 2015 UTC,"Up to you really. If you feel you might break your first airbrush, buy a cheap one. I recommend getting a better compressor though. Something with a tank and changeable PSI output.  Things I did wrong with my first brush: Overtighten the nozzle (Could break the thread) Drop the needle head first onto the ground. (Bent needle)"
modelmakers,3b6r3n,windupmonkeys,2,Fri Jun 26 13:17:30 2015 UTC,"The airbrush I use costs about that much. There are some compromises.    They are definitely not precision machined, at least, no more than is absolutely necessary. Expect less precision, more slop, not as finely polished surfaces. (In fact, if I were to buy another one, the first thing I'd do is open it up, diassemble it, lube and polish all parts I think would interfere with the trigger and valve).  They need to be kept religiously cleaned, and require more maintenance per session. Why? My theory is that the less precise, rougher machining (and some design flaws) make it easier for paint to catch onto rough surfaces of the nozzle, needle, and tip, making tip dry a bigger problem than with other brushes that are more expensively lined.  Are they servicable? If you keep them religiously clean, clean them and strip it down each session (the nozzle, needle, tip, nozzle head), then they work just fine. But if you don't clean it, it will jam a lot faster than everything else.  Spare parts are ""expensive"" relative to the cost of the brush. It's rarely ever worth it to say, buy a new needle, you might as well buy a new brush and have some spare parts."

Unfortunately you pay for what you get. Don't be too disheartened if your airbrushing results are not what you expected.  I'm not trying to put you off purchasing it, just know going into this purchase that the results from this airbrush will not be as good as a better priced Iwata..e.t.c  I'm sure if you just want to do base coats simple camo patterns it will be fine to learn the basics.  As some have also mention the compressor defiantly try and go with one with a tank and a regulator to control the pressure, I brought mine on clearance at a hardware store for less then 30 bucks.  I hate to say it, but this pair will probably cause you more frustration than is worth getting. Save your money buy something better."
modelmakers,3b6r3n,BrettSlowDeath,2,Sat Jun 27 23:22:40 2015 UTC,"While I'm one of the main users around here of cheap airbrushes, I'm inclined to agree.   When I say religiously maintained, I damn well mean it. They are NOT the kind of precision instruments you get with more expensive brands like Iwata. If you do not religiously strip it down to clean every single session you use it, indeed, maybe even between colors, you WILL get tip drying, you WILL get jams, and you WILL get splatter or unwanted behavior from these kinds of brushes.   Their machining tolerances are ""just enough to work"" and fit and finish (don't let that chrome fool you) are ""serviceable"" but will never reach the kind of precision you get with a more expensive brush.   I actually don't use a tank, or moisture trap. I manage fine most of the time, but that's because I understand my equipment fairly well.   As the old saying goes: as far as tools go, you get what you pay for.   This setup is good to try out airbrushing to see if it's for you if you want to put in a minimal investment, but if you can afford better, you are better advised to get the more expensive stuff. However, don't buy too expensive equipment either. It's like precision equipment or higher end equipment for any hobby or profession or what have you. If you buy something too expensive, it's wasted on you until you can appreciate the difference."
modelmakers,3b6r3n,windupmonkeys,2,Sat Jun 27 23:51:32 2015 UTC,"This is the combo I picked up back in March. http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001TO578Q?psc=1&redirect=true&ref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o04_s00  I totally agree with what's already been said here; you get what you pay for. Being a beginner with airbrushing, though, I do not think sinking $80-150 into a brand name airbrush is the best idea. I was more concerned with getting something reasonable to learn on and a compressor that I could grow with. u/windupmonkeys hit the nail on the head with treating these guys with care and staying up on cleaning duties. I think that's a good habit to develop though.   I just switched over from primarily running Testors enamels to Tamiya acrylics. On my first couple of runs/color switches I thought the Tamiya stuff was a pain in the butt to clean and seemed to cause some flow problems, but I stripped my airbrush down a couple of days ago and gave it a thorough cleaning. The needle had become completely stuck in its housing. That's user error from not doing a more complete cleaning often enough, and not having the time/remaining patience after the above mentioned troublesome paint session. Definitely user error.   The combo I posted is twice the amount of the two links you put in the op, but I think something like this is a better investment for something you're going to spend some time learning and even longer perfecting. Aside from from the issues I already talked about which are my own fault I am completely happy with the set up. It has been a great rig to learn airbrush basics with, is quite a bit more versatile than starting out with a single-action brush, and the compressor should be able to tackle just about anything I throw at it from here on out."
modelmakers,3b60of,redryder74,3,Fri Jun 26 06:44:26 2015 UTC,"You can probably use it as a wash. The reason why people tend not to use the same paint for their wash as their primary layer is because the thinner will attack the paint. If the new layer (washes, filters) do not chemically react in any way to the cured paint underneath, that's what you use. The rest of it is just whatever artist material/pigment carrier is easiest to work with or has the most desirable working properties.   Would I recommend doing it over a layer of acrylic? Not unless at minimum it's sealed with a coat of future.   The alternative is also to use watercolors, which is what I use. I hate messing with oil paint because of the smell, and while the drying time is an advantage and the translucency is also helpful, it's infinitely easier cleanup (and easy rework) with watercolors. Just make sure to use a drop of alcohol or a touch of dish soap to break surface tension.   Short answer: yes. Long answer: you're probably better off trying to find something other than the actual paint you're already using to wash it, because if you mess up, you'll end up using solvents that would strip off the underlying layer, or risk interacting with the cured paint.   Alternatively, try a commercially available enamel wash."
modelmakers,3b60of,windupmonkeys,2,Fri Jun 26 07:29:32 2015 UTC,"I don't know what that winsor & newton stuff is but damn I've never heard wash thinner to be cracking plastic. just use plain old oderless thinner (white spirits) to thin your oil paint/enamels and you should be good. The thinner for washes you see in the ranges of e.g. ak interactive is actually the same thing. Oderless thinner is less agressive and does a splendid job.   Anyway, if you want to use acrylics it is a possibility, but don't expect the same results. The second thing is that because of the way water acts you will have a 'drying circle' around the part you put your wash on. You'll need to be quick to remove the circle too, since the acrylic will dry solid (unremoveable) faster than the oil paint wash (or enamel wash if you will). I remember mig jimenez making an entire dvd with tips and tricks on how to paint a model with only acrilics. this was the result: https://www.michtoy.com/michtoy/Picture2_VMC-75000B.jpg  so it's very possible but way more time intensive and finicky.   Another tip for using washes, don't shower your model in it, there's no real reason to. In fact when I do washes I use a small brush and do part by part, I have more control over it then."
modelmakers,3b60of,Doctor_Fritz,2,Fri Jun 26 09:49:23 2015 UTC,"You can. Acrylic washes can work though they are a little more work to get just right than oil washes are.  Vallejo actually makes a line of Armor Washes that work closely to oil washes right from the bottle that I really like. I've been using them more and more.  Alternatively, you can thin your Vallejo paints with a thin medium like Liquitex Airbrush Effects Medium or their Matte Medium (thinned 50/50 with water) to get a better result. Water alone will pool and create tide-lines of paint as it dries. The medium will help to better distribute the pigment."
modelmakers,3b60of,jayadan,2,Fri Jun 26 11:10:06 2015 UTC,"Yes, absolutely. If you want to use diluted paint, either use wash medium or a timy bit of dish soap to disrupt the surface tension. Many companies make acrylic washes that are meant to be used with acrylic paints. Whenever you mix two different kinds of paint in separate layers, always put the hottest paint down first and seal if you can. I primarily work in water-based acrylics (I'm a wargamer), but I've got a few Tamiya jars I use on occasion, mostly for historicals. I've got like one or two enamels and I don't think I have any lacquer paint."
modelmakers,3b60of,zerogee616,2,Fri Jun 26 17:07:12 2015 UTC,"Should work OK, I do this.  Tamiya acrylic paint will even work well for this, because it is diluted so much the solvent is too weak to pick up the main color.  I would NOT add alcohol to an acrylic wash to change surface tension, because it can dissolve the binder. Soapy water should work fine though.  Also, a tiny amount of glycerin will slow the drying time, so you can work with it and wipe it off if need be."
modelmakers,3b60of,MadMorf,3,Sat Jun 27 00:58:23 2015 UTC,"Fair point. I prefer dish soap to alcohol, but if I don't have it available that's what I use.   When I say alcohol, I mean literally no more than a drop. Any more than that, and /u/MadMorf is right, you'll strip your paint right off.   I use 91% alcohol as thinner and stripper for tamiya acrylics."

modelmakers,3b3cv5,MadduckUK,2,Fri Jun 26 12:11:32 2015 UTC,"I think is a very good kit. Sure, you must forget the sharp detail Tamiya gives you even on small parts or details, but I think is a good kit of a beautiful Aircraft. It goes together without any major problem.

I'd like to know how they compare to other kits (I've read that their Cr42 and C200 are the best kit in that scale, but I've never found a comparison between CA and italeri kits)"
modelmakers,3b3cv5,flounderflound,2,Fri Jun 26 19:06:49 2015 UTC,"Well, not the Fiat and the Macchi, but I did try a Classic Airframe kit once, their beautiful Sparviero kit :  link I almost finished building it, it is done at at a 90% state, I reckon, but it fought me back so hard that I never had the nerve to prime and paint it. My skills simply are / were not on a par with that box...Once done, the Classic kits do look magnificent, the shapes look right...I will try again, when / if I'll think to have improved my skills :-)  I built the Skyknight from Czech Models: I had to get out and shell out for a Dremel tool just to put the pieces together! No easy ride, no shake and bake...well: Classic kits are on the next  difficulty level IMHO :-) Italeri kits allow nice results without being too difficult to assemble, and are not as expensive as the other brand.

modelmakers,3b4i7g,WhatsMyLoginAgain,3,Thu Jun 25 22:13:08 2015 UTC,"Just be careful using a Dremel to thin the plastic as to fast of a rotation will melt the plastic as opposed to thinning it. I'd just use regular sand paper and do it by hand. I do use a Dremel occasionally but more often for cutting holes and pieces out.  Recently I attempted to polish a canopy with my Dremel and a polishing head, but I did get a little carried away with the speed, luckily the kit came with two!"
modelmakers,3b4i7g,frugm1,1 point,Fri Jun 26 01:19:08 2015 UTC,Good point on melting the plastic. Will need to be careful with speed and go slowly. Certainly no spare hull in the box!
modelmakers,3b4i7g,llordlloyd,2,Fri Jun 26 04:28:45 2015 UTC,"Use the Dremel steel cutters like these. These are the shapes to have, the ball shapes are the most useful. I use these a lot for thinning engine cowls and other parts on short-run kits. In the pic you can see the results on the wing root, back of the lower wing part, and the engine cowl in the background of the lower pic.  They shave the plastic away and there's little danger of melting it.   It's a messy process, I usually do it outside. Hold the parts up to a light source to determine how thin they are. I use the round burrs mostly. The flat, drum-shaped ones are best for thinning wing trailing edges. The main thing to look out for is don't run right up to the edge of a part, and the burr will catch the edge and cause damage where you don't want it."

modelmakers,3b4i7g,Gewehr43,2,Fri Jun 26 04:30:16 2015 UTC,"wait, are these those oval holes used for venting ballast tanks?   The other way is to drill a few holes using a dremel or something, then fill in the hollow ""straight"" areas with a file. Try on sheet plastic or scrap before you risk your model though.   Same principle. Beware heating from the drill bit melting plastic though.   With a pin vise, this is not going to happen, but it's so damned tedious. In any case, if you're looking to hollow out all those holes, it's still going to be tedious.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1I_UJNaKcbc"

I'd recommend starting with a much simpler ship, like a launch, or my favorite starter, from Artesania Latina, the Swift sloop.

modelmakers,3b2lx6,WhatsMyLoginAgain,3,Fri Jun 26 06:27:29 2015 UTC,"Also check out sites like modelshipworld.com (and especially their great forum) for wooden ship building tips and techniques. As /u/prestersean said, it's a lot of new techniques, even just working with wood vs plastic.  Not to discourage you though. I did exactly the same thing years ago and love building wooden ships. Something like the Constitution may take you a few years part-time (typical builds like that can be 2-5 years) so I agree with starting smaller, if nothing else to practice planking and rigging before getting into a large ship. But, plenty of people start with a big ship and work slowly, learning as they go.  Enjoy, and it's a whole other rabbit hole of tools, techniques and kits!"
modelmakers,3b2lx6,Prestersean,2,Thu Jun 25 22:04:36 2015 UTC,"That's very true as well.   I always call the rigging on a sailing ship the model within the model.

modelmakers,3b0y6y,FlyingLowSH,2,Thu Jun 25 13:11:03 2015 UTC,"My solution was... to stuff it up and leave it! I probably won't weather this any more than the very minimal amount I have (a bit of fading in the panel centres, and a barely visible dark pin wash using a colour that looked pretty much the same as the Sea Blue). F9Fs stayed pretty clean.  This kit is good and extremely easy to build. The jet exhaust is simple and the tube thick, and the decals are not crisply printed. Otherwise, a nice model of the USN's first jet."

modelmakers,3b20jy,riceandpea,5,Thu Jun 25 09:31:01 2015 UTC,"Better alternative to glue is tamiya extra thin, green cap, liquid consistency.   Princeton Brush company makes a bunch of Golden Talkon brushes. I would get a 1/4inch brush (since you're brush painting) for large surfaces, 1/0 for smaller detail work, and then a 5/0 or 10/0 for micro detail work.   Just go to any art supply store and they'll have brushes of this sort, they cost probably no more than a few pounds each. The bristle will have a distinct orange/yellow color to them, hence the name ""golden talkon.""   It need not be Princeton Brush company product (which is a US brand), but something similar.   The general rule is that most Tamiya kits  will fit better than average, but it's more or less a case by case basis because each company has older kits in their catalogs that are from a different, more primitive era of plastic molding tech.   You do not need to purchase an airbrush right away. This is generally the preferred method of painting because it makes laying down an even coat of paint with most paints much easier. However, you need to learn to brush paint anyway, because detail work is often done with brushes, or where masking the entire cockpit to paint one control level is just silly and impractical. However, I started using them early because I use cheap, clone models of airbrushes made by Chinese manufacturers. I can't recommend them to everyone, but they serve me just fine. I will eventually upgrade to a far more precise, carefully machined brush, however.   Decal setting solution: never used the Humbrol variety, I prefer MicroSol, and when the marking is particularly stubborn, Solvaset, but I don't recommend the latter for beginners because in some instances, it'll attack the paintwork.   You forgot one item: clear coating. Either use Future Floor Polish (US name), or Klear (that's I think the UK name), or buy a bottle of Humbrol http://www.airfix.com/us-en/humbrol-gloss-clear-125ml-bottle.html.   After you are done painting your model and before applying decals, you overcoat your model with a layer of clear to prevent the decals from showing visible film residue as much as possible.   Paint colors are generally denoted on the box of the product you're buying, particularly for Airfix kits and Revell kits. They will have the ""paint number"" needed on the side, for Airfix, Humbrol paints, for Revell, their proprietary line. If you want to use another company's paints on that model, you need to find the equivalent paint in the brand of your preference. Many people use either a mix of brands, or they stick with one brand and have to mix custom ratios to get the color they want. If you want to know in advance what you'll need, go to the manufacturer's website and look up the kit, where they will often list the colors needed, but usually for their proprietary or preferred brand of paint. Some of the Chinese and smaller manufacturers, however, because they dont produce their own lines of paint, will suggest multiple callouts for different brands.   I would suggest that for your first build, relax your standards a little. You do not need to paint every last control panel line correctly, in fact, right now, since you're brush painting, work on laying down an even paint job and building a model that you would be happy  to show instead. The detailwork comes with time.   As you get more advanced, pick up an airbrush, and various either weathering powders, washes, etc, or formulate your own from artist oils, or pastel chalks as weathering powder.   The sidewall has some color comparison programs and things that you can use.   As for paint, I prefer acrylic, because it doesn't smell quite so bad and cleanup is with water. However, I can't recommend the Humbrol brand of acrylics, especially if it's the same paint they include in their starter sets. That paint is crap. It doesn't cover well, doesn't stick well, has surface tension issues that can cause it to ball up on the model, requires copious amounts of shaking each time you use it to turn it from a pile of glop into something pretending to masquerade as paint, etc."
modelmakers,3b20jy,windupmonkeys,2,Thu Jun 25 20:15:18 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the amazing response! I actually just nipped out today and grabbed an Airfix Zero starter kit just to have a play around with. I'll post a picture once I'm done. It was only £8.  Spraying the model with clear coat. If I'm using matte acrylic paint, will the coat make the model shiny? What about weathering effects, am I okay to do this on top of the clear coat? If so, I presume I need to apply a second coat at the end.  I was looking at the Tamiya acrylic paints today, they are cheap and my local Hobbycraft has a good range in stock. Are these paints any good?  The rest of your recommendations I will research tomorrow. Thank you, I really appreciate the advice!"
modelmakers,3b20jy,windupmonkeys,3,Thu Jun 25 23:08:20 2015 UTC,"The answer to that is I should've also said: Get a can of flat (spray is probably better) for after you finish decaling.   So it would go like this:    Build, paint parts using common sense, i.e. consider prepainting parts that would be difficult to reach once installed or hard to mask.  Gloss coat with Future, Klear (the floor polish stuff), or Humbrol Clear.  Decal, using solutions if you wish.  Seal the decal coat with a flat coat.  Weather using your weathering fluids/powders, whatever.  Possibly a final flat coat to seal in the weathering.    Tamiya paints are good only if you have an airbrush. They are infamous for being difficult to brush paint properly. Not until you get an airbrush, I'm afraid.   The only person who provides a tutorial that I like for brush painting tamiya paints is this guy   https://zerobxu.wordpress.com/2008/03/10/hand-painting-with-tamiya-acrylics/  But I still don't recommend it for a beginner. Humbrol enamels are supposed to be pretty good to work with. Generally however, try to apply  thin coats if you're brush painting as opposed to one thick one, and build up the color. This is precisely what Tamiya acrylics are bad at; they strip off the underlying layer when you try to put on the second layer unless you really know what you're doing or have the right thinning ratio.   Brush painting tutorial:  http://www.finescale.com/~/media/import/files/pdf/c/f/9/basicsofbrushpainting.pdf  A good hand brush paint is Model Master Acrylic, but  ONLY if you use a enamel or other primer for it, or it WILL lift off when you try to mask/use masking tape on it.   Tamiya paint is good, but only if it's sprayed. Some people can get it to brush paint well, but the vast majority of users I've ever run into never brush paint it because it has unfavorable properties for it.   Yes, the clearcoat I recommended will make it glossy. However, for decal application, this is desirable. You can always flat coat after you finish decaling, which is what most people do. Otherwise, you risk ""silvering.""    A detailed description is at this link.   http://uamf.org.uk/faq/decal.html  I have built that zero before. This is my attempt at it. I gave up on the starter set paint though. The only way to make that stuff work is to mix it 50-50 with Tamiya Clear, and then to spray it. Out of the bottle, it's garbage.   http://www.reddit.com/r/modelmakers/comments/28cacs/airfix_172_zero/  http://www.reddit.com/r/modelmakers/comments/28cacs/airfix_172_zero/  I, however, did use an airbrush for most of this, aside from probably the wheels, the engine, and the interior of the cockpit, which is why it looks so splotchy. The interior of the cockpit I think I used the included paint which like I said, is utter garbage."

modelmakers,3b20jy,cacheflow,3,Sat Jun 27 23:23:28 2015 UTC,"It's definitely on a kit by kit basis. Some old Tamiya kits are pretty bad. And there are better versions of some vehicles made by other companies (Tamiya's T-62 for example, and their Leopard). It's the same with Airfix, since they still sell some very old kits and you will have to do some research to know what you're getting. And of course neither of them make kits of everything, so if you decide you want to build, say, a T-80 or something you'll end up looking at Trumpeter or somebody else anyway."

modelmakers,3az6ce,f0k4ppl3,3,Wed Jun 24 20:27:00 2015 UTC,"You got me on a roll, son! Cut the piece out, grab it with tweezers, dip it in water with a drop of hand soap in it and place the wet decal on the model near where it's going to be. Now the film separates from the backing while it's on the model and you don't have decals floating on water. Use a brush to place a drop of the same soapy water on the area where the decal needs to slide onto. Soapy water breaks surface tension and lets it slide easier into place. Let the whole thing dry completely before placing decal setting solution. Cut decals out with an x-acto knife, it's more precise and you can cut them out in the middle of the sheet. Use a wooden toothpick to push decals into place, a metal tip will gouge the model."
modelmakers,3az6ce,solipsistnation,1 point,Wed Jun 24 20:39:51 2015 UTC,"I've never thought about the soapy water trick!  I will probably try adding it to the water, but I may use micro-set instead of applying it to the model itself.  Toothpicks, though... I like that idea.  I have a pretty decent workstation with all my exciting little tools and knives, so the cutting won't be too much of an issue I think :P"
modelmakers,3az6ce,cat6_racer,1 point,Wed Jun 24 20:49:33 2015 UTC,"One I figured out recently. Need to paint a very small canopy frame, right? Don't mask and paint the piece! Make a decal! Get blank decal paper for printers, white or clear, cut a piece then paint that the color of the canopy frame. Now cut strip off it the width you need and use that instead. Perfect canopy frame without fuss! Works for just about anything. Need to paint somewhere difficult? Make a decal! Enamel paints work best for this."

modelmakers,3az6ce,goondam,6,Wed Jun 24 19:22:50 2015 UTC,"Academy and Revell have really been throwing a lot of decals into their kits lately. It's intimidating but what I usually do is make my way around each image one at a time, and the list gradually dwindles away."
modelmakers,3az6ce,Ron-Swanson-Mustache,3,Wed Jun 24 18:51:25 2015 UTC,"Yep, that's the plan!"
modelmakers,3az6ce,Quarterscale,3,Wed Jun 24 19:20:18 2015 UTC,I tend to have mixed feelings on these ones. On one hand I love that there's so much detail to be added. On the other I hate spending ludicrous amounts of time on decals. But I don't want to exclude any available detail.
modelmakers,3az6ce,sleepwalker77,4,Wed Jun 24 19:26:04 2015 UTC,"I COMPLETELY agree.  Plus, more decals=more chance of messing one up (which, as we all know, will be the ONLY thing we notice whenever we look at the model...)"
modelmakers,3b1ipz,Fortunate_0ne,2,Thu Jun 25 05:28:01 2015 UTC,"It only took a few hours to get to this point, but I'm fairly certain the easy part is behind me. I'm going to work the seams of these sub-assemblies, then...the dreaded mating of the wing to the nacelles. Then, more filling and sanding."
modelmakers,3b1ipz,Plotwister,1 point,Thu Jun 25 05:30:39 2015 UTC,How's the kit?I own it but haven't started building it yet.  Good luck!
modelmakers,3b1ipz,Plotwister,2,Thu Jun 25 19:17:39 2015 UTC,"It depends. It can't really be compared to something like a Tamiya. The plastic is nicely molded with few imperfections. But, detail is sparse (but not inadequate) in a few places, namely the cockpit and wheel wells. The fit of the parts up until the nacelle/wing mating was good (again, not Tamiya good, but good enough).   I went ahead and mated the nacelles to the wings, deciding it would be better to fix the seams all at once.   Alignment was, as many have said, tricky and left some gaps. I started by aligning tails and the horizontal stabilizers, made sure the vertical tails were plumb, then aligned the wings to the nacelles making sure the nacelles were parallel and the tails still plumb. It probably took an hour or more to slowly glue and realign the parts to maximize alignment while minimizing gap.   The result is an aircraft that is true, but in need of some filler and seam work.   Here are some pictures of the build, including a few to show the trouble spots.   http://imgur.com/a/wDxy3"

modelmakers,3b0nhi,Superbird4300,9,Thu Jun 25 00:45:53 2015 UTC,"You certainly, certainly should. Bare plastic looks like soap. Weathering is easy and covers, indeed makes a virtue of, 'bad' painting.  I'd make this as a vehicle of the Jordanian Army used in 1967."
modelmakers,3b0nhi,llordlloyd,3,Thu Jun 25 02:11:31 2015 UTC,"As a boy I didn't paint most of my models until I was into my teenage years. I will definitely say that my unpainted models aren't worth displaying at this point. Dust and sun will fade the color of the plastic over time. Probably not so much on a green tank, but I have a Dauntless that was grey - once. Now it is a hideous grayish-yellow disaster. At the very least, I'd recommend putting a dullcoat on it. Military vehicles don't tend to be shiny. It'll also help protect the color from harsh dust and sun."
modelmakers,3b0nhi,flounderflound,4,Thu Jun 25 19:38:12 2015 UTC,"Yes. If you suck at painting, the best way to learn how to not suck at it is....practice painting.   That said, if you just like building models, well, it's your model. That's up to you. However, the reason why kits are molded in the base color is so that people don't have to paint them if they don't want to."
modelmakers,3b0nhi,windupmonkeys,3,Thu Jun 25 01:27:07 2015 UTC,This.  If you suck... how will you ever unsuck?
modelmakers,3b0nhi,alaskafish,2,Thu Jun 25 01:48:13 2015 UTC,"Also, not gluing means that any area where the join is imperfect, or where there is a seam line, it will be visible.   While painting doesn't automatically solve this problem, it certainly will be more noticeable if you don't paint, unless the kit is very cleverly engineered, and you're a very, very neat builder who never uses a single drop of glue more than necessary."
modelmakers,3b0nhi,windupmonkeys,2,Thu Jun 25 01:59:02 2015 UTC,"I'd paint. Like /u/windupmonkeys said, how will you get better if you don't practice.  Fortunately, it's not a hard thing to paint. You're not doing anything crazy camo schemes. Just a single flat coat of olive green."
modelmakers,3b0nhi,alaskafish,2,Thu Jun 25 01:50:02 2015 UTC,"All up to you.   If you really feel that you need to better your skill (and I suggest you should, if you feel the challenge would be fun), I suggest you paint the first coat with some kind of primer, so you can better see the difference your olive drab paint would make in comparison to just the plastic surface."
modelmakers,3b0nhi,captainwacky91,2,Thu Jun 25 02:45:55 2015 UTC,Yes.  At least put some matte coat or something because the plastic is too shiny.
modelmakers,3b0nhi,uggmun,2,Thu Jun 25 04:02:10 2015 UTC,"Depends, An unpainted model can really show off surface imperfections such as glue or sprue marks. On the other hand if that doesn't bother you then sure go ahead and keep it unpainted, It doesn't matter as long as your having fun!  Also, painting may be daunting at first but the only way to get better is practice!"
modelmakers,3b0nhi,Ahatr,1 point,Thu Jun 25 00:55:04 2015 UTC,Most of my tanks aren't wearing an overall paintjob because they're molded in acceptable colors anyway. I don't see much point in spending money to repaint it the same exact color it already is when it's gonna live on my computer desk for all eternity and I'm satisfied with the as-molded color.  You only need to respray it if you think it needs it.
modelmakers,3b0nhi,MrBlankenshipESQ,1 point,Thu Jun 25 04:48:28 2015 UTC,"Try using a spray can to paint it. You'll get a flat, consistent finish without too much effort on your part."

modelmakers,3az8jr,dalotherealdeal,3,Wed Jun 24 18:12:10 2015 UTC,"The kit should come with a paint guide. For WW2 US tanks, you'll need some olive drab, a lighter green for mixing and shading, black, brown (for wood and stuff), a grey for the rubber tires, a metallic color (gunmetal, for example) for drybrushing over the machine gun barrels and stuff, and a light greenish to paint over any vision blocks or periscopes (if the kit doesn't come with clear parts).   Depending on the type of tracks, you probably need a dark orange-red for rust and an orange/dark rust wash (Vallejo has some nice ones). And you'll probably want a dark green or black wash for panel lines and engine grills and stuff like that.   That should get you started... But when in doubt, check the instructions on the kit."

modelmakers,3az8jr,DeathbyPun,3,Wed Jun 24 19:32:24 2015 UTC,"Agreed with /u/feralwestcoaster. I recently built a Tasca M4A3E8. And while it was amazing, the amount of parts was mind boggling. Over half the parts were for the tracks alone. Go with the Tamiya M4 line. You can't really go wrong with them. Paint guide is included."
modelmakers,3az8jr,Feralwestcoaster,2,Fri Jun 26 01:18:16 2015 UTC,"A sherman is a great place to start, I would recommend the tamiya M4, its not the most accurate around but it has great fit, a bunch of extras for stowage, some figs, and is a straight foreword build wit hthe option of some different paint schemes. DOnt get me wrong the DML and Taska/Asuka shermans are amazing but at triple the parts count and a lot of extra work you'll appreciate more with a bit of experience. Look around the net as well, reddit is great for advice but stick your head into http://www.armorama.com for some more techniques and examples. Keep us posted on your progress!"

The entire thing goes together with practically no glue, but it's way more advanced than a typical snap-together kit.  I completed assembly last night, as you can see in the pictures below.  The attention to detail on this kit is really great, even the cockpit is fully detailed, despite being largely hidden.  Once assembly was complete, I've broken it back down and am paying close attention to removing the few seam lines that are present.  However, the kit does a really good job of hiding them, so there are only a few to clean up.  http://imgur.com/a/ebj0h"

Bought this kit two days ago at my local hobby shop, first ship kit I've ever done and I'm really excited to get it painted. Almost 100% done building it, just need to place all the photo-etch handrails which should take a few hours.   I was working on a Hasegawa 1/32 N1K2-J before, but I stopped working on it temporarily while I finish building / painting the Atago."

It'll be the most detailed build I've ever done.  I'm 8 or 9 days in, and so far the fuselages aren't even joined. I'll show a few preview pics here, though. This is the right side cockpit, and here is the left side.  As of last night I'm working on the radio room. Neither Hasegawa nor Eduard seem to have plans for the room that would normally be the bomb bay (between the cockpit and radio room). Still, I think this should be really cool when finished. I've got a lot of little detail painting to do here and there, too - I painted many of the interior parts before removing them from the sprues, so there are injection points that need to be touched up.  Between the kit itself and all the Eduard add-ons, I think I'm sitting on more than 500 parts. This one may take a while..."

There's an Aber PE set, the fuel tank set (which came with its own PE pieces), the metal barrel, and the PE that came with the kit. Plus some bonus wire and stuff, and rearranging some of the parts (like the cage around the lights) to match the photos of the actual vehicle:  http://i.imgur.com/1Cy89pI.jpg  Luckily I had lots of photoreference since I made sure I got a lot of pictures before the museum closed.   And then of course, metal tracks, with everything that implies... 8)  It was pretty great, but I think it was just about as much of a project as I can stand at one time. I'll probably do another detailed build like that again, but it'll be a tank I'm really into, and another one I have lots of pictures of from the MVTF.  Oh wow, I just figured out what you're building, too. I saw the pile of sprues and wondered why it had so many clear parts, so I looked for pictures-- I didn't realize it was that giant crazy double-fuselage thing! Neat!   Your cockpits look pretty great already."

I'll post vague WIP pictures every Wednesday but for the most part I'm not gonna give it away until it's done. My pictures this week were more than enough to give it away with 2 cockpits. But we'll see. More than anything I wanted to show off the detail this week.  I'm at a weird point here. I want to do mostly unusual stuff these days. I've done the normal stuff - 3 B-17s, 3 B-24s, 2 B-25s, a B-26, an A-26, 2 B-29s,3 P-38s, 6 P-51s, 7 P-47s, 3 Dauntlesses, 3 Corsairs, at least 4 Bf 109s, 2 Hurricanes, hell - I could go on for a long time here. Now I want to build stuff a lot of people haven't seen before. Stuff that not everybody knows about. The 111Z is one of those, I did an XF5U Flying Pancake a few months ago, and I've even got an Me 323 Gigant lined up. I've got plenty of ""normal"" stuff too, but now I'm leaning toward the stuff that doesn't get so much attention.  And your knowledge on that fuel line impresses me. I did the museum thing, too - I went to the USAF Museum in Dayton and snapped over a thousand photos. That stuff is always fun."

Something about them makes me scared... like they're super pale.   I think you should paint the figures with highlights. You know, darker colors in the recesses and lighter colors in the higher places. Maybe a wash on the figures to tone down the colors and add to the highlighting.   Other than that... fantastic! What scale is this?"

Building a nice setting for the model has become just as fun to me as the model itself.  For me it helps slow down the process.  I definitely burn through kits a lot less.

modelmakers,3azbi5,Rahana101,3,Wed Jun 24 18:32:49 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure how many tricky bends you have on these - curved, rather than right-angle. But if you find you're struggling to get the brass to retain its shape, you may want to try 'annealing' the part - that is super-hearing it over an open flame (like a kitchen gas burner) until white hot and leaving it to cool. This won't make the part more flexible, but it will help the part retain the shape you bend it into. I have found it essential to forming round curved P/E parts  like exhausts."
modelmakers,3azbi5,Camarupim,2,Fri Jun 26 10:15:33 2015 UTC,"well, you can try drilling through the ximm with a pin vise after the CA has cured, grab handles look much better in bent wire anyway. For the rest of the details you can either drill through the ximm again for locating holes or just line them up carefully without and ca them on.  You may want to do the main zimm sheets after the hull is together to minimize the gaps between, remember this stuff was troweled on over the whole surface not in panels. You may need to do a little touch up afterwards to blend it all together. Id recommend Apoxie sculpt or miliput for that. Good luck!"
modelmakers,3azbi5,Feralwestcoaster,2,Wed Jun 24 18:48:44 2015 UTC,"My best advice to you is to plan plan plan.  Before I built my Jagdpanzer IV with stupid amounts of aftermarket PE, I spent a night going thru the instructions of both the base kit and the PE kits.  I marked which parts in the base kit would be replaced with PE and from which fret (the ""sprue"" for PE) they came.  That helped immensely as I moved forward with my build.    In my case, I more or less followed the base kit instructions and just replaced plastic pieces with PE as I went along.  There were some larger PE assemblies that took multiple nights of building before they were ready to be put on the kit itself.    I'm not sure exactly how I'd handle the zimmerit and mounting the tool brackets.  I'd think you'd have to cut out holes for the tool mounts somehow.  Likewise, the skirt hangers on the will be an interesting challenge too.  Did any instructions come with your PE kits?"
modelmakers,3azbi5,Gewehr43,2,Thu Jun 25 18:59:20 2015 UTC,"Yes, the instructions are actually very thorough, marking which parts of the kit to remove/replace, including the Revell part numbers (made sure I am ordering aftermarket PE specificaly for my exact model) - so there really is no guessing etc about which goes where or what to replace. Everything is neatly demonstrated (it's Eduard PE, if you are familiar with their instructions) - the issues I do have come when trying to put the instructions into practice use :D Spent 2 hours yesterday just cutting off and gluing on the front fenders, hour of that being just dry fitting and turning them around trying to spot ""the position"" they should be in. Frustrated as I was, I just glued them to position that I found to be ""most similar and appropriate"" and I'll see how it looks when the model is finished and painted."

That said, it looks like vallejo is hurting by the competition by Ammo and AK interactive seeing he's bringing metals and color packages out instead of just colors. Vallejo has had most of these acrylic metal colors for years now (which aren't really very good imho). Frankly there's only one product besides alclad that I've seen that actually makes decent metal effects and it's the polishing powders by uschi van der rosten.   Also the paint rack, really? There's a way better alternative in the workspace organiser system (modules) of hobbyzone if you ask me."

But since ""the Mods"" put mamoco.se in my flair I guess it's a toss up really. This time I thought it would be cool since /r/modelmakers is more or less first with these news.  It's nice to see that Vallejo reacts to the market. As a hobbyist I prefer their paint since they're consistently good out of the bottle (unlike the Mig-ventures). Hopefully the metals work well, I wouldn't mind not having to have all the windows open when doing bare metal finishes, it'll also be easier to get since they have a better & bigger distribution network. Time will tell."
modelmakers,3ay1x2,Doctor_Fritz,1 point,Wed Jun 24 13:04:08 2015 UTC,"I agree, vallejo has some good paints for brushing. I don't know if you have used the last Ammo acrylics, they are imho even better than vallejo at this point. While vallejo has a range dedicated to airbrushing only with their model air I found the Ammo acrylics to be brush ready straight from the bottle (where you need to dillude vallejo before brushing unles you want brush strokes in your paint) and you can use them in the airbrush without much problems too. Airbrushing standard vallejo colors is a hassle and I never really liked that.  I'm not a big fan of AK interactive though. There's just something off with their products. Something with the mixture of the thinner in their washes, and the acrylics I don't really like either tbh.  I guess it all boils down to taste and preferences. I'll keep an eye out for those metal colors though. color me intrigued."

Normally I spray Tamiya and it comes out beautifully, but I've been using Vallejo to paint a Garage Kit from Volks, since they're callouts are all for Vallejo. And goddamn. No matter how I thin that stuff, it comes out exactly the same way. And don't get me started on drytip, I could spray straight thinner and it'd probably drytip somehow--I've never once drytipped with Tamiya"

modelmakers,3ay1x2,XenophonTheAthenian,2,Wed Jun 24 18:04:54 2015 UTC,"Better. Still needs to be thinned down some, it likes to drytip after a little while, but not nearly as bad as Model Color. Goes on with a lot less fuss too, but you also have to shake it up real well, and I've found that I'll have to stop every few minutes and stick a toothpick in there to mix it back up again, because the pigment likes to separate out very quickly for some reason"

Model Air is kinda ""meh"" to brush paint.

I was all worried about storage, too, but now thanks to a sale last month I have a little more paint than paint rack so I might as well just buy the damn paint and get it over with.   The problem I run into is that the Model Color and Model Air colors aren't quite the same thing, or have different names. I wish they'd just make 2 versions of the exact same thing, give them the same name and number (so they're like 70.020 and 71.020 for White or whatever) and make it easy on us."

I've been building an Alicia Melchiott Garage Kit while I wait for my Pz IV tracks to come in, and holy christ, between Volks' simply wrong color callouts and the fact that I can't figure out Vallejo's coding...argh"

The brush paints included in the SWS p-51 kit were bad for brush painting, while the Air stuff was good, but not great.   At the same time, however, it at least had the benefit of being far less smelly than everything else.   If this is a good substitute for Alclad, then by all means, I'll probably find a use for it. There's a very good reason I've never used Alclad, i.e. the smell and the relative toxicity of the stuff. It's nasty to work with."

Shipping is fast, and prices are variable, if you keep watch you can get real bargains. A lot of retailers also market through amazon too, even if you said you'd like to branch out. It has essentially taken over, from where I'm sitting, to the point where unless I need a specialty item, I can probably find it at the same price or from the same vendor on the site. SprueBrothers and Megahobby, for example, both sell on there, as does Phil's Hobby, which for whatever reason, does prime shipping so I use their Amazon storefront instead of their actual website, if there even is one.   The only thing Amazon isn't particularly good for is supplies (paint, etc) unless ordered en masse, and aftermarket accessories like resin and photoetch tend to be vastly overpriced."

The one I use next is usually Megahobby, or I just loop it into large orders. Freetime Hobbies I might also have done once or twice.   Supplies, unfortunately, especially paints and  solvents generally must be shipped by surface mail, so they are slow to arrive.   HOWEVER. For whatever reason, if you like AK, Vallejo, or Mig Ammo products, those are available in large lots on Amazon, or in individual ""booster packs"" as they are marketed these days (e.g. ""Allied Tank Colors"" or ""German Panzer Colors"" or ""Panzer Aces Colors Pack.""   Because those paints are waterbased, they tend to be available for fast shipping.   For Tamiya, Enamels, and similar, expect to wait for surface shipping. Some places might ship them at low prices, but genearlly, when ordering supplies online, you would probably be best suited to come up with either a piggyback purchase, or buy at least several at once.

I tend to order a couple things at a time so shipping has never seemed outrageous.  Buying any small item from almost any online shop is going to see you spending more on shipping than the item itself.  But, ~$9 USPS priority for a kit or two seems pretty reasonable to me.  I've never had them be out of stock either.  They usually ship within a couple days.  Another good site is hqhobbies.com  They are a brick and mortar shop that is expanding to the online domain and I was able to find a couple out of production kits in their inventory.  Shipping was super fast.  Prices were reasonable and their sales tech was phenomenal"

I didn't actually screw up, but I was spraying Mr Color lacquer ""Character Flesh"" for a garage kit of Alicia Melchiott from Valkyria Chronicles that I've been building (since I can't consider my Garupan Pz IV finished until it has its tracks on, and I've got to wait for the shipment), and it's so irritating to thin. I finally got it to spray right, but it had to be thinned down in like a 5/1 ratio of thinner to paint--any thicker and it would dry before it even left the airbrush and would either spray grains or straight up cobwebs. I mean goddamn. To top it all off I didn't like the color when it was sprayed--looks fine in the jar, but it's too light for my taste when sprayed, even for them light-skinned anime girls. So I'm gonna have to go back and mist some Tamiya flesh over it to darken it slightly. Argh.

Additionally, I often use craft-acrylics for washing cause they're water based (super mild) and super cheap.  If you try to wash using lacquer, then I will look forwards to seeing you in next weeks TIFU thread."
modelmakers,3avctf,bobbotlawsbotblog,2,Wed Jun 24 00:39:13 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't use lacquer thinner over acrylic paint, especially not tamiya. Tamiya and Gunze paint would be stripped off by it. As for whether it affects future floor finish, I don't know. It also depends on which thinner you're talking about. Tamiya lacquer thinner would probably strip most acrylics right off, and at the very least, would strip off tamiya acrylic. The stuff you get at a hardware store is even hotter than that.  There is absolutely no reason why you would use lacquer thinner and oil paint to make a wash. Lacquer thinner is one of the ""hottest"" and most reactive solvents you could use short of paint stripper.   The standard recipe for a wash is using oil paint and the thinner you use for OIL PAINT. Lacquer thinner might not even work, though it's so hot it probably would thin oil paint as well, probably in unpredictable ways, and subsequently, probably causing damage to the paintwork.   Before the advent of all these commercial washes and solutions, oil paint + turpenoid/oil paint thinners was exactly what a wash was made of. Companies today bottle that stuff for you, but the composition is more or less the same.   I personally prefer tubes of watercolors (windsor and newton), some water, a drop of alcohol or dish soap to make a wash, because it's much easier to remove compared to even oil washes if you mess it up, and it doesn't smell quite so bad.   It's the same with weathering powders. While I'm sure the companies have produced some kind of proprietary blend of pigments and the like for their product lines, the original version of it (including for those people who now produce it as a product) was a mixture of pastel chalks and similar pigments, ground up, and then applied with a chemical/liquid fixative. The rest of what they do is just preblend, pregrind, and design an entire system of weathering techniques around their artist-material derived products.   See the tutorial/information below.   http://www.modelairplanebuilding.com/washes.html"

It looks like you left off all the grab irons and stuff on the turret-- I don't blame you, since those are pretty tough to get on there without locator marks or anything... If you wanted to do that kind of thing without having to deal with the tiny plastic parts, you can use copper wire and a tiny drill (like a pin vise and a 1/16"" bit) and superglue to hold them in. It's often worth doing for those kinds of handles and things.   Otherwise, what people said-- washes will be your friends. 8)"

modelmakers,3annmj,uscmissinglink,2,Tue Jun 23 02:24:52 2015 UTC,"Pingpong balls were much lighter, easier to mount, and the ""dimples"" in the reference picture are triangular, so I chose to just make them smooth and lightweight.

If you have authentic memorabilia as a collector I could almost understand, however I think hanging it might still be in poor taste unless it's part of a bigger display of artifacts.

I'm not suggesting your fiancee should be completely comfortable around the real thing, but I've also run into more than a couple of instances where one party of a relationship made the other give up a hobby either because it made them feel uncomfortable (motorcycle riding, skydiving, building icky death war machines) or because they thought it was a waste of time (model building, collecting, etc.) and think we need to work with our significant others to make sure it doesn't come to that."

You might, then, find this interesting. H.G. Wells, famous peacenik, was well known for playing wargames, and some attribute the modern wargaming with miniatures in part to his efforts. Of course, he also wasn't always a pacifist either. Point is, even pacifists play with war toys, and those who criticize it, well, that's their business.   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Wars  See also the open source copy of the book:  http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3691  Again, the point is, doesn't really matter how you justify it. You can be a peacenik and still play with wartoys. But that's what they are, and no amount of rationalization will get around what the subject ultimately is.   Also, while I would personally find hanging up a nazi flag strange, it isn't that strange if you think about it. It's not all that far from memorabilia collectors hanging up flags of various military units, displaying medals, and god knows what else.   Think of it this way: you really think someone who LOST their side of the war would so favorably view say, an American flag hoisted up in some militaria collector's house? Or a Rising Sun pennant? Or perhaps a flag from the Crusades?   It cuts both ways. This hobby in one fashion or another replicates many, many war machines, and for whatever reason, many, many GERMAN war machines.   https://archive.org/details/littlewarsgamefo00well"

He used these kinds of toy cannons (made by a very famous toy soldier company) to shoot at actual targets for his little war game. I have a few stashed away, they are quite amusing and fun for what they are (little spring launchers for matchsticks and lead pellets).   I also have a weird habit of generally leaving off all the stores of most airplanes. One, because they're generally very tedious to build, and second....this is not an actual airplane, and the ordnance load doesn't matter to me anyway."

They hired Hugo Boss to design uniforms-- US and Russian uniforms were pretty utilitarian in comparison. They had architects who took International Modernism, stuck some classical architecture in there, and came up with a look that heavily inspired the Brutalist buildings that sprung up in post-war Britain (replacing the buildings destroyed by the Germans with buildings based on German war architecture...). There are echoes of WW2 Flakturms ( http://www.airpower.at/news03/0813_luftkrieg_ostmark/flaktuerme.htm ) on every US college campus that started new construction in the 60's and 70's. (Heck, the hippiest college in the US, UC Santa Cruz, has a straight-up concrete bunker as an administration building.)  And the design of their vehicles were pretty futuristic too-- Panther tanks managed to embody a sort of chunky-but-sleek menace (even as their transmissions burned out going up hills). All those angled planes of armor looked very modern and exciting coming out of the 30's and 40's, when rounded vehicles were cool. Sure, big steel boxes like Tiger tanks didn't work too well, but they were intimidating and powerful vehicles.   So yeah, I totally understand by German stuff is popular...

(And girls too, obviously). One either has to make peace with the idea that building them isn't necessarily an endorsement of anything at all, except modelmaking for its own sake (and learning some history, horrible or not), but let's not kid ourselves here. The vast majority of us make models of war machines, whose sole purpose is to provide ever more creative ways to kill things, or more things, or more things for less explosive."
modelmakers,3anoh5,35thArmorGuy,5,Tue Jun 23 22:01:08 2015 UTC,"This is a very strange hobby when you think about it.

modelmakers,3anoh5,solipsistnation,6,Mon Jun 22 16:44:37 2015 UTC,"Yeah-- very strange. I think it's an attempt to understand it a bit, and to get some sense of ownership of stuff that happened before we were alive. I think my own fascination with Soviet-era stuff comes from growing up in the 80's when Soviet Russia was the scariest thing out there. The models I build are the tanks that would have rolled across Europe if a shooting war had started. East Germany (original owners of the T-72M I used as the basis for painting my T-72M model) was particularly scary-- I went to Germany in high school, and I remember a tour guide taking us up to a signpost on the edge of a forest and pointing out the barbed-wire-topped chain link fence about a hundred yards away. A little ways down we could see a guard tower, and saw somebody with binoculars looking back at us, and while we watched a couple of trucks drove by and slowed down as they went. They were definitely looking back at us.   So building DDR equipment helps me get a handle on that, and on the constant fear of global annihilation that hung over us. I've also read some biographies written by people who were growing up in the Soviet Union at about the same time-- knowing that the people we thought hated us were also scared (and were also just kids, and were hungry all the time) helps put it into perspective.   ""A Mountain of Crumbs"" by Elena Gorokhova is a pretty interesting biography:  http://www.amazon.com/Mountain-Crumbs-Memoir-Elena-Gorokhova/dp/1439125686"

modelmakers,3anoh5,FlyingLowSH,1 point,Mon Jun 22 03:29:04 2015 UTC,"Just adding something to the situation according to nowdays Germany:    Public use of several symbols connected to Nazigermany is prohibited. The specific law section is Strafgesetzbuch Paragraph 86a. This law is just concerning public, not private space. And, a law would not be a propper law without an exception. §86 allows to use, for example swastikas (even in public space), if used for educational purposes, art, science and research, documentations or similar.    Albeit in private rooms everybody can do whatever he wants to. Also putting up Nazistuff. It's not nice to know that out there are a bunch of people that still believe in this crap after 70 years. But well, aslong they do it within their own four walls and don't affect anyone... let these poor bastards be.    And, like /u/flounderflound pointed out, if a plane in WWII had a swastika on its tail, so the model should have it.

And Maschinen Krieger is pretty heavily inspired by Wehrmacht stuff-- the Strahl Republic is pretty Nazi-ish, complete with caps and stuff, and a bunch of names and naming conventions are borrowed from WW2 Germany-- Lots of ""ausf.

I'm not going to try to say that all of Japan loves the heck out of Nazis or anything, because that's obviously not true, but it seems like there's an otaku subculture of Nazi fetishism which seems to be pretty divorced from, you know, death camps and that side of Nazi stuff and just more into the style.

It's not as though that's absent from the west either, though. That it exists in Japan is obvious (although I'd be more worried about the neo-Imperialists--most Japanese people don't get much actual education about the Nazis because, well, it doesn't really involve them much. Same way few westerners learn jack about Chinese or Japanese history, even in the modern period--when I was in high school the extent of our lessons on Japanese culture during WWII was that the Japanese military co-opted the government and convinced everybody to be a fanatical weirdo. Not only is that not really true, or at least a gross oversimplification, but that was all we learned of a period only a few decades removed from us!), but it exists in the west too, and in a much more sinister form. The ""clean Wehrmacht"" myth, the legitimization in many circles of Nazi warcrimes because ""people in Germany didn't know about it"" or ""it was only the SS,"" and the incomplete denazification of West Germany have led to a very serious and potentially disturbing discrepancy among many westerners between the Nazis and regular old Fritz. It's a discrepancy that has some validity, but it's not really true--the ""clean"" Wehrmacht consciously cooperated in war crimes, and bought into Nazi ideology, and the military leaders that many wehraboos praise (*cough* Rommel *cough, \cough* Guderian *cough) were perfectly willing to accept and embrace the ideas set forth by the Nazi regime, even if they were not politically involved. The failure of the (extremely small, really) portion of the Japanese otaku population (which is already a pretty weird group to begin with) to understand the immensity of Nazi war crimes and the horror of the regime is as much due to the total ignorance of the subject as anything else--you see the same thing in the west, where *at best knowledge of the war crimes committed in Nanking (or, rather, the PRC's version of the story, which does not fully line up with what happened--nor does the official Nabe version, either, but Nabe's an imperialist supporter) comprises the total sum of knowledge about Japanese war crimes in the eastern theater. More likely, though, the average westerner that you ask is only going to know things like kamikazes, the Bataan Death March, and banzai charges, and will be completely unable to explain why those things happened, except ""fanaticism""--which is sort of true, but it's vastly more complicated than that.   What I'm getting at is that I don't really think the weirdo military otaku who are really into Nazi stuff, without really understanding what it means, are any better or worse than what we see in the west. Like much between the east and west, it's really just different. We speak about Japan being weird and all that, and it's not really true--your average Japanese person finds the apparent American obsession with BDSM bizarre and can't understand why the Americans would be so heartless as to drop two atomic weapons on civilian populations during an already-won war. It's not that there's really anything fundamentally better or worse, or even different, it's just that the expressions and experience are different. They're no weirder than the rest of us, they're just weird in a different way. Which applies to military otaku of the bizarre type--it's not that different from the hordes of vocal defenders of Rommel or Von Rundstedt, who claim that they were simply soldiers with no political or ideological motivations or influences at all, an obviously absurd statement, and one that can be really scary when it's used to legitimize actions that the people who are talking know perfectly well were horrible.   TL;DR: To paraphrase Thucydides, Wehraboos are everywhere and always, and they are more or less the same  EDIT: I think I should also add that a lot of the removed comments on /r/AskHistorians are indicative of this trend in the west, especially on a rather reactionary place like reddit. You're not a flair, so you can't see the removed comments, but a lot of us flairs notice them before they're removed and we very frequently discuss them privately, to figure out what to do with those sorts of people. It's astonishing how much wehrabooism there is--a lot of those posts haven't really done anything wrong, so they're allowed to stay, and they almost always end up on /r/badhistory. Hell, recently a new sub, /r/ShitWehraboosSay was started up, because it's really pretty shocking how common a lot of these attitudes are"

modelmakers,3anoh5,flounderflound,4,Tue Jun 23 16:40:34 2015 UTC,"In my library, I have a first edition of the thoroughly academic work ""The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich"". On its spine is a rather large swastika.   Sometimes it makes me uncomfortable that others might not know what it is and to draw incorrect conclusions. But, I am comforted by the thought that even if that swastika held some nefarious connection to my own belief system, that I am entitled to hold those beliefs, or display those symbols, especially in my own home, over the objections of, and offense to, others.   We like to champion the values of freedom from oppression that the Allied victory in WWII symbolizes, but we can't celebrate freedom without tolerating other's very freedoms of speech and belief."
modelmakers,3anoh5,LOLtheism,5,Mon Jun 22 02:57:10 2015 UTC,"I agree with you wholeheartedly. I actively keep sheets of swastika decals so I can always make sure my planes are marked correctly. That said, there's a world of difference between a swastika on a book about WWII or on a model airplane and straight up hanging the flag over your workspace. Having a book or a model makes it fairly clear you're interested in the history.   Hanging a flag on full display for all to see makes a statement, whether you intended to or not. I'm all for freedom of speech but common sense is a must."

I think it's important to note the symbolic and implied significance of hanging a flag. You display a flag either on a pole or on a wall, and it means that ,in some aspect, you align with what it represents. If it's in your own home, you have every right to display something symbolic like a flag, but you also need to be prepared for the social consequences.  I think people have the right to hang it if they want. As long as I have the right to tell them it's a tasteless, horrible thing to do."

I think that it is as okay for someone to hang an SS flag in their room, as it is for you to have an FW-190 sitting on your bookshelf, or I having a book with a swastika on the spine of a book in mine.  I have relatives who jumped in with the 82nd and 101st on D-Day. I myself earned Airborne wings in the late 1990s. I say that to illustrate not some sort of superiority to anyone else (because it doesn't give me that) but to show that I feel a deep connection to that part of history. It is in my blood. That connection should make me more inclined to agree with you, than less.  As repugnant as I find both the hammer of the  socio-political theme behind Nazism, and the anvil that was the final solution, I think prior restraint on our freedom of speech is exactly the opposite of what the Allied victories stand for in history.  There are military collectors who collect flags in the same way that we collect models, or books. That is their connection to history, and this is a piece of history that shouldn't be forgotten no matter how vile.  That being said, I do agree with you that freedom of speech does come with a level of personal responsibility. I exercise that in a way that I feel is respectful to myself, my country and others. That doesn't mean that I should be able to enforce my ideas of decorum and civility on others. Isn't that wholesale enforcement of a set of ideals exactly the blind flaw in national socialism that Nazism represents?  If we disallow speech, especially the use of symbols such as flags, we are allowing the tenants of tyranny that so many brave men and women gave their lives to defeat in WWII, win.   At least that is my view."
modelmakers,3anoh5,Fortunate_0ne,3,Mon Jun 22 04:30:44 2015 UTC,"I don't disagree with you there - people have the right to hang a flag like that, especially in their own homes, and they should have that right. However, they should be prepared to face any backlash they may receive as a result, because others may voice their opinions about it as well upon seeing it. Basically what I guess I'm getting at is that those who choose to exercise their freedom of speech in a controversial way will face controversy, as others have their right to free speech as well and will speak out against it.  Where it comes to for me - should it be legal? Absolutely. Is it distasteful? Yeah - I like to collect things for historical value too, but something like a flag has to be handled carefully, I think. With you and I both being Americans, you know people here put a lot of emphasis on the symbolism of our flag. While the intent of hanging a nazi flag on your wall may be to show off a collector's item, that flag represents something the same way as our own does.  There was a white power rally here in St. Louis not too long ago. They voiced their hate, and we spoke out against it. Freedom of speech is included the first amendment because it is the absolute foremost of our rights as Americans. While I stand firmly in my belief in it, I would encourage everyone to be mindful of how they use it and whether their use of it actually contributes anything to society. The things we say and do says a lot about us as individuals. Freedom of speech should never be disallowed, however it should be used wisely and never abused.  Thanks to you and your relatives for your service, by the way."
modelmakers,3anoh5,flounderflound,1 point,Mon Jun 22 14:02:53 2015 UTC,"I don't want to continue eating up space on a modelling message board debating freedom of speech, though it is an interesting subject and we seem to be discussing this civilly.   All I ask is that when you openly want to criticize the speech communicated by others, even if their speech seems to sympathize with a viewpoint as vile as Nazism, ask yourself what your point really is. Are you just trying to silence another's viewpoint, or are you trying to debate the merits of their position with the merits of yours?  The former position is without merit though is certainly an exercise of freedom of speech. The latter is a position that is more in line with the spirit of those freedoms and is necessary to maintain them.  At least that is my view."

modelmakers,3anoh5,E6H,2,Mon Jun 22 18:01:41 2015 UTC,"This disturbs me as well. If you look at the majority of dioramas in exhibitions/online, you'd have the impression of the Germans actually winning the war. (And the Russians beaten.) The majority of these dios depict burned-out or captured Russian hardware (but not US/British generally), and victorious German forces at crossroads, by said burned-out tanks, in cities, etc, chilling, asking directions, or generally looking rad. This can partly be explained by the overabundance of German models vs anything else. (Which, in turn, can be explained because of their looks, their diversity, and their popularity... You have to give it to them: their uniforms looked great, and their hardware looked pretty cool, too.)  It's a slightly bit disturbing. (Also: the general militarism of model builders. A subset of people seems to be building to live out their fantasies -or their glory days in the armed forces. It might be strange to complain about this -after all, I'm building tanks, too- but still.)"

modelmakers,3anoh5,llordlloyd,1 point,Mon Jun 22 01:03:30 2015 UTC,"What I quickly noticed when I picked the hobby back up and began searching it out via social media is there seems to be less of a fascination with Nazism within the ""core"" of builders than there is with predominantly American teenagers (who also tend to run a lot of WWII history instagram pages).  Now, I wouldn't put too much stock into it. I'm an archaeologist and spend most of my time with my head buried in a book; the majority of the (American) public have no clue about some of the atrocities their favorite Presidents and Generals committed. Teddy Roosevelt is one of my favorite examples, but that's another story. However, what begins to worry me is if you do a little digging you start finding a lot of these kids post some pretty vitriol stuff on their personal, and sometimes thematic, accounts. Most of it towards the Muslim populations of the world.  It's not my place to tell people they're ""wrong"", or that they have no idea about the realities that sit behind the symbols and slogans they've attached themselves to. My concern is where they're getting it from and what is says about our youth and our futures."
modelmakers,3anoh5,Zorak30,1 point,Mon Jun 22 17:29:07 2015 UTC,"Modellers tend to admire the engineering side of militarism, and of course the Nazis were uncompromising in their approach- in fact a key reason they lost the war.  So people conflate admiration for technology and tactics with the symbols of the regime in whose name all this was done.  I would suspect in most cases these modellers don't actually admire Nazism: they probably like their democracy, their Jews, and are happy to wear daggy clothes.  I am much more annoyed that I live in a society with many Nazi tendencies: refugee children locked up on tiny islands where the guards sexually abuse them and their mothers; a media constantly whipping up fear of ethnic minorities while ignoring pressing domestic problems; the shutting down of opposition on the basis that 'you're either with us or against us'; freedoms destroyed n the name of national security.  I'd be happy to see more Australians admit that they would fit in really, really well in Germany c. 1938."

modelmakers,3anoh5,coacoca,1 point,Mon Jun 22 16:36:03 2015 UTC,"The way I see it, politics are hardly involved. A nazi flag, ultimately, was the main symbol of one of the factions of WW2. I find it no different to collecting military propaganda. I find sometimes, it can serve as a grim compliment to a german collection. I must really stress this now, I have no love whatsoever for the nazis, I like the aesthetic of their military entities, and I hardly see anything wrong with that (mind you I wouldn't hang up a flag, not my thing, but I see why others might). Ultimately, like others mentioned, it's really just a prop, and if there's any pro-nazi feelings with the associated modeller, well, I wouldn't want anything to do with that person, but they have a right to be as pro nazi as they want, as long as they don't involve/invade (not in the sense of poland :p) others. I really have to stress that I'm entirely neutral on the subject, and am in no way pro-Nazi, before any accusations come my way.

My god it was a pain in the ass, each part needed modding and sanding etc, due to the 70s tooling.   It lacks any weathering, as the missus wanted to see it looking fresh.   Even though this was one of the hardest kits I have ever built I really enjoyed it.   The base coat is a humbrol spray can and the rest is hand brush acrylics (humbrol/citedal)  Can anyone recommend a black wash or the such?   I used an old old citadel brown was for the interior, and realises at the end having a black wash for is critical."
modelmakers,3aippv,SnarkMasterRay,3,Sat Jun 20 16:06:39 2015 UTC,"Greetings - I just started their 24th scale P-51 tonight, so I can feel your pain. I like to use both brown and black for washes, sometimes I want a more intense wash and I'll use black for that, and brown in other areas on the same model that I don't want looking quite as noticeable (panel lines versus flight control edges, for example). I generally bounce between making my own washes with artists oils such as Winsor & Newton and mineral spirits, (which can also be used for ""pin washes"") and buying a premade wash by a company like Mig Productions. Mostly the former."
modelmakers,3aippv,SnarkMasterRay,4,Sun Jun 21 05:04:39 2015 UTC,"Is the P51 still the old tooling? I feel your pain if it is.   Yeah I wanted a black wash for the engine (was going to paint it dark gunmetal then apply a black wash)  I enjoy using a brown wash on ground vehicles etc to add that dirty rusty mucky effect.   The spit has very subtle washes on the undercarriage and a couple of recesses on the wings (tiny circular ports).   Thank you for your advice, and I'm looking forward to your p51.   Even though it was a bad ache to build the spit I enjoyed more than one that went together perfectly. Also the large scale for the price is pretty good."

If that is the case, aim the brush away from the model, start the air, move to the model, start the paint, paint, stop the paint, aim away, stop the air. It's pretty good practice to get into anyway.  If its when you start the paint then I don't know."

modelmakers,3akt5c,Destructias_Warlord,2,Sun Jun 21 05:06:13 2015 UTC,"Thanks for replying. 1) Air pressure is about 15 PSI, and 2) the clumps and blotches start as soon as paint starts flowing from the needle, and will continue randomly as long as it's spraying. I probably should have provided an example of that too..."
modelmakers,3akt5c,Camarupim,3,Sun Jun 21 05:13:10 2015 UTC,"Could be a piece of dirt stuck in your nozzle. Add some thinner and cover the front and start spraying.  Your paint cup will start bubbling. This will let air through your nozzle, pushing the dirt out through the body. Also check if your airbrush is leaking by dipping it in water. When you take it out, spray. If you see any bubbles come out where it isn't the tip, it's leaking. When your nozzle leaks, the paint seeps out to the front of the brush and when you spray, the pool of paint that collected at the tip of the nozzle gets blasted forward resulting in that kind of spray."

Just replace the airbrush?"
modelmakers,3akt5c,SnarkMasterRay,2,Sun Jun 21 10:37:40 2015 UTC,Try very thick grease. I have the tamiya thick grease for airbrushes and it works great. I reapply the grease every 2 months even though I get no leaks.
modelmakers,3akt5c,84mg09,1 point,Sun Jun 21 12:51:19 2015 UTC,"Just as an experiment, try thinning it out some more or more air with the same thickness (maybe around 18-20PSI). I have an Iwata HP-C and I get that from time to time when the paint is a bit too thick. It'll build up a bit before reaching a critical mass and ""dripping"" off the needle in a spatter. When that happens I generally thin it out some more and then make sure to start the paint ""off"" the model in the air or into a paper towel so the spatter doesn't touch the model until the thinned paint has a chance to work its way through the brush."
modelmakers,3akt5c,ionizzatore,1 point,Sun Jun 21 14:52:16 2015 UTC,When that has happened to me (acrylic) it was because my paint was thinned out too much.  I'm shooting an Iwata double action.  I generally add more paint to the feed cup to rectify it.

Other than that, she is finished.  Overall its been a pretty good build. I feel like I am getting back in the hang of things.   Except decals. Decals are still giving me trouble three builds back.  This kit I used an Eagle Decals aftermarket set and most of the decals went on fine. The slobbering wolf ripped on me in a few places as I was positioning it, and I pieced it back together as best I could.  The real  kick in the crotch was the US national insignia that is on the top of the wing in the foreground. At some point during the drying process it developed tiny hairline splits all through it. It isn't noticeable unless you look at it directly. Otherwise it sort of appears that there is dust in the clearcoat (which happens, but isn't the case here).    I think there might be a problem with either my technique or the chemicals I am using for decal set / softener.  I have Mr. Mark setter that I apply under the decal and a brush on top of it, then I use Mig Decal softener a few minutes later to help the decal contour.  I don't like the way it works. The decals don't silver, per se, but the small stencils especially appear to almost become opaque and unreadable once a coat of dull is applied. There are almost 80 decals on this, and virtually none of the small ones are legible.  Ugh.   I'm thinking that it might be a combination of mixing the brands of set/soft, perhaps I'm not waiting long enough for them to cure (roughly 24 hours), and/or I'm not getting a good base coat with future underneath them.  The odd thing is that when I tried to apply future on top of the decals, it beaded up on the areas where i had used the set and soft, and that created a whole other problem that I had to rectify.  Any suggestions?"

If the car's lowered it's gonna hang up on those broken post-apocalyptic roads, if it's lifted its suspension may be too fragile to handle the recoil of that big gun. The bigger tires will grant it the additional ground clearance itt'l need in post-apocalyptia without messing with the suspension, also they'll confer better traction. Gotta figure that, in most post-apocalyptic settings, paved roads are a luxury nobody has to enjoy anymore and everything has to be equal parts off-road capable and tough as nails."

modelmakers,3acxpa,Rocat,2,Sat Jun 20 06:39:50 2015 UTC,"No, wahsable white is a very different alternative to using hairspray/chipping fluid then paint. Those methods create chips in the paint surface, peeling patches of paint away, so you either have the top colour or the underlying colour. The washable white is pretty much whitewash.. it is water soluble once it dries, so you use a wet brush to wipe it away and it works progressively. It is much more subtle, and has the advantage you can just add and blend more white at any time. it is super important to add a clear coat over the whole thing when done of course. An interesting experiment (might try this on another model) would be to use chipping fluid under the washable white, see if the best of both worlds can be obtained!"

modelmakers,3aadc1,FlyingLowSH,3,Thu Jun 18 14:20:10 2015 UTC,"Hey folks,    I call my Hasegawa F/A-18A finished. It took a while, but here we are, just in time. The kit is okay, and so was the build, too. It lacks some accuracy, some joints could be better. But the kit itself is almost 30 years old, so I did not expect anything else. Recommended if bought cheap on Ebay or some flea market.  The depicted plane is an early Hornet flown by VFA-113 'Stingers'. In 1985 the squadron was deployed to USS Constellation with Carrier Air Wing 14. Over ten years later, BuNo 161927 was in service with VFA-203. On January 15th, 1996 the plane crashed near the runway of NAS El Centro. Pilot ejected safely.    The loadout of the plane fits to the years 1985/86. Three Mk.81 (250lbs) iron bombs, one rockeye cluster bomb, an AIM-9 on the wingtip, along with an AIM-7 Sparrow. Further there are two fuel tanks and a AN/AAR-50 ""TINS"" pod.    The build was made pretty much straight out of the box. Rockets were added form the Hasegawa weapons kit, TER and bombs from my spare parts box. Decals are out of the box, too. But I recommend after market decals, those of the kit are way too thick.    Feedback & (constructive) criticism always welcome.    Edit: My imgur-preview seems not to work. I hope it works for you others out there! Edit II: Yay! Imgur-preview works now."

modelmakers,3aadc1,Plundersquirrel,3,Thu Jun 18 14:50:13 2015 UTC,"This is pretty incredible! The weathering is great, could you share what you did?"
modelmakers,3aadc1,Plundersquirrel,4,Thu Jun 18 15:09:11 2015 UTC,"Thank you! Yes, for sure, here's how I did the weathering:    First step was preshading; black/dark grey for panel lines, red, white, blue spots for other surfaces (depending on how it's supposed to look, other colors are possible, too). Then the main color was applied (FS36375 on the top, FS36495 on the bottom), using Gunze Sangyo Mr. Hobby Aqueous acrylics. Surfaces on the top got a postshading, too. For this I lightened up FS36375 with a tiny bit of white, creating some lighter spots.    Then the usual gloss clear coat - decals - gloss clear coat procedure followed.    Now the actual weathering. I do not use any inks or ready-to-use-weathering, I have my own recipe, depending on the effect I want to have and what basic color I have. The mixture consists of water, dish soap and some fine milled pastels (black, anthracite, dark brown, reddish brown, yellow ochre and light olive green). To bring out panel lines I use darker tones, mix everything up until I've the right texture and brush it on the model. After some time to dry, I wipe the model off with some cloth or tissue. To bring out other details, for example oil stains, I mix more brownish/olive pastels with water and dish soap. I brush them on with a fine brush. To let them look finer I correct them with cotton swabs and other brushes, that are just wet (!). While doing this, selected panel lines can be worked out better / separately.    I hope this helps! If there're any questions left, feel free to ask."
modelmakers,3aadc1,Plundersquirrel,2,Thu Jun 18 15:37:10 2015 UTC,Thanks.  I've never heard of preshading with colours other than black before. Can you give an example of where you'd do that? And what colours give what effects when preshading?
modelmakers,3aadc1,makeitlouder,6,Thu Jun 18 16:06:17 2015 UTC,"When I do it depends on the model I'm working on. If it's going to be a rather new plane, I'd go with ""normal"" preshading. If it's going to be a heavy duty plane (like carrier based aircraft in general), I'd chose the ""colorful"" way.    Also, credits for this should go to someone else; I just copied what I've seen on the internet some time ago and was pleased with the result.    The effect itself makes the color look spotted, a bit uneven, like it has been repainted and/or heavyly used. Potato quality examples incoming! I use red, blue & white for darker or blueish greytones. Lighter, brownish greytones get variants of grey and white as an additional preshading. It depends what you want to create. For example a grey main color sprayed over a yellow preshade can look like a slightly oily surface."

modelmakers,3abp4x,coacoca,1 point,Tue Jun 23 03:37:39 2015 UTC,"Not sure about the new and exciting future :P but thanks .  As for tools, you really only need a bunch of brushes, both synthetic and natural round and flat of several sizes.  As for supplies, acrylic paints for chipping, chipping fluid to create the worn winter cammo (don't remember which brand I used but I tried a few and they all work pretty much the same), white tamiya diluted with water; on top of this I added a bunch of layers of oils (mostly winsor&newton stuff) starting with a general filter then doing more localized effects and streaking; colours where eyeballed but, it's always handy to have stuff like, burnt umber, naple yellow, a dark blue, dark green, white, buff and some light grey; and to finish it up some pigments ."

modelmakers,3ab5k9,Plundersquirrel,2,Thu Jun 18 19:26:44 2015 UTC,"78.99 with free shipping at Tower Hobbies. It's most likely cheaper than what some people in here spend on /35th versions(AFV Club or DML T-34/85 + Fruil tracks = $$$!) and it's definitely a great way to try out /16th tanks.  It did start out life as an RC before becoming a static model, though, which I know is a bit of a turnoff for a lot of people in here. I don't mind too much and I'll probably RC this one at some point, but it does mean there's a few screwholes in it. Most of them are in the floor pan which you'll never look at and can safely ignore, and they include a battery door for the battery box so you needn't fab up a blockoff plate to close that hole, but for some bizarre reason they put one coming down through the vent on the back of the engine deck. The included plug? Don't waste your time it won't stay where it should, better to putty it over and re-inscribe the grille lines. Also they drilled a bunch of small holes in the engine access hatch so's the speaker in the RC tank could speak, something they didn't remove from the molds when they started making static tanks. Those even I'm gonna patch up. Eventually. I need to stock up on rattlecans to paint this thing as it is, probably pick up my first ever tube of modelling putty at that time.  Fit and finish is great, though. I didn't have to molest any of the parts to get 'em to go together. It built up nicely, on par with the Tamiya T-34s there.  The tracks are pretty good, individual links held together with metal pins just as would be found on the real tank and the completed runs articulate pretty nicely. You'll need a hammer to put 'em together, though. Each track link with a guide horn has a small ridge molded into the inner side of the center pin boss. This ridge is there on purpose, it holds the hardened steel track pin in place. It also makes it quite difficult to just push them in, however a little percussive persuasion knocked them right in. I got both runs put together whacking them with the hinge rivet of a junky pair of sidecutters I had in my toolbox, so you don't need a huge hammer, but you will need one. Or, I 'spose, you could use that pair of junky sidecutters you don't care about messing up, that works too. :P"

I am about to start the Dragon M1A2 SEP but converting to the Aussie version, and I found Voyager had some of the best options - turned barrels, various PE and resin super detailing sets and upgrades, etc. Great set for the turret bustle racks too.  You can order direct or find a local distributor through them.   Eduard also worth a look, as are sets by ET Models and Legend Productions depending on what you are after."

modelmakers,3abn8n,TheMeowster,3,Thu Jun 18 20:01:53 2015 UTC,"Since you have an airbrush you could also try to heavily pre-shade the lines in black, and lightly spray the base coat so the shadows will peak through.  However, I think this method should be used only if you don't have the patience to rescribe all the lines."
modelmakers,3abn8n,Cookiescool2,3,Fri Jun 19 00:15:51 2015 UTC,I think panel washing with raised panel lines is close to impossible. You could try to sand the panels off and rescribe it with a hobby knife.

modelmakers,3a8kc0,darthstyrene,7,Thu Jun 18 02:05:16 2015 UTC,"Here are my ""Alaskafish's Competition"" rules. I have been a judge, so I know what they're looking for (wasn't as harsh as the others I knew). I'm assuming you'd be doing it for fun rather than not for getting that sweet first place.     Figure out how many people will be there   In my opinion, it's important to know how many people will be there. From personal experience (competing in both Alaska and NYC), larger competitions can be a little more nerve-wracking. It also means more people that will be against you. Smaller competitions are more communal... but may not really mean anything large if you win. I find smaller ones more fun, especially because you get to know everyone and everyone shares tips. For most of these tips, I'll be talking about the mid-large sized competitions.    Figure out the departments and categories your competition has   I once went to a competition to submit a WWII 1/72 tank to only realize they didn't offer an 1/72 armor. So, I kind of just had this model I worked ages on in my hands as I walked around. They may also separate into styles of painting, ala brush or air. Most likely they won't.    Research what you will be submitting first   Especially at the large competitions, the judges are going to be stingy about what they're seeing. They'll usually not be in a good mood because they need to see thousands of models and spot them for any types of discrepancies. Make sure the model you bought is something accurate. I remember a couple years ago, someone bought a model kit (which was really well done) of a Spitfire, to only get the judges to say that the wings were not well positioned. And it wasn't the modelers fault, but it was the designers of the kit.   Use correct colors   Nothing bothers me more, especially in a competition when someone uses the wrong colors. In the competitive environment, it doesn't go well (unless there's some sort of obvious artistic license like painting that tiger tank pink). A judge once said that painting models incorrectly because it's fun is just a waste of his time. And to be honest, most people won't be interested in a P-51 painted Japanese army green, and Panzer grey, because you didn't have olive green and silver.    Go over your model a lot.   A lot of people in more amateur competitions don't go over their models. They'll often neglect some obvious details. Usually I'm no stickler to the wrong number of rivets or so forth, but forgetting to fill in a gap... no.    Don't be afraid to spend a little extra on this model   Some people think that it should be straight out of the box (unless the rules are stated). Usually I spend $20~ for each kit I buy. Aftermarket parts can bring that price upwards of $40~. And for my average model shelf model, I won't do that. But for a competition, I will. Don't forget that aftermarket doesn't just mean prats. That means decals. You really... really don't want your decals to silver. So make sure you trust the company or buy aftermarket. Aftermarket parts will save you a lot of time, instead of making them your part... they'll just set you back some gold.    Weathering should be minimal   I've see people just weather their tank or plane to absolute destruction (unless it's suppose to be destroyed or rusted). Weathering hides details from the viewer that you could have worked so hard on, or that was on the kit such as filling up panel lines making them invisible. You can weather, especially realistically. But still keep it to a minimal. Imagine if you were displaying an actual tank... you wouldn't want to just drive it covered in crud. But it's okay to have a bit. Only a few people can properly give a heavily weathered look. Being able to still show great detail and be super weathered takes a lot of skill. It's best to not go into that department unless you really need a super weathered kit.    Don't worry about age   I remember being mortified going to my first at the age of nine. It was horrible. I walked into a room full of old 80 year old men... I was sure Santa was there too. I'm still afraid of going to these things and I'm in my 20's. But at the end of the day, you just end up taking tanks and planes and boats and models with these people. They won't see age, so if you're young, don't worry. As long as you know what you're talking about, you'll be okay. And chances are, you do. Because after all, you're on this sub.   Don't go in with an attitude of a winner   It's a strange thing, that's for sure. But no one likes someone who's self confident. But even if you don't express it. Don't go in thinking to your self you will win. Because chances are, you won't. Not you specifically, but mathematically, you're competing against probably 50 others about the same skill as you. Go in with the attitude of sharing your model and learning from it. Remember, think of it more of a book club for people who enjoy slathering plastic planes together... not the Olympics. It should be fun.    The best to take away from these competitions is to not win. It sounds kind of counter-intuitive to join a competition not to win. But you're winning knowledge. Take the time to go over people's models and just ask the creators questions. Think of it as a way to get a quick answer. I always post here asking ""what color do I paint this?"" ""how do I achieve this look?"" and so forth... and it takes a few days for a good reply. But there, you'll get one instantly. You'll make new friends, learn new tips, get some new kits on really good sales... and hell, maybe win.   Good luck!"

modelmakers,3a8kc0,SnarkMasterRay,1 point,Thu Jun 18 16:45:29 2015 UTC,"It does only if you let it. I enter competitions not to WIN, but to bring something to show. Most people who attend shows or contests are there to look at models; they don't care if they don't have winners ribbons on them so much. Winning is a fun surprise, but really, if you want to help a show, bring a bunch of models because that's what people want to see."
modelmakers,3a8kc0,SnarkMasterRay,1 point,Fri Jun 19 05:29:43 2015 UTC,"I'm going to take issue with some aspects of your post. For one, there's a missing component that plays into things a bit. Know WHAT and HOW models get judged. IPMS rules favor basics - are the wings on even, are all of the seams filled, are there no glue spots visible? ""Use correct colors"" doesn't matter much in this scheme because it leads to expert judges arguing over whose colors are more correct and who has the better references rather than judging the better build. Likewise, I've seen a lot of models where the builder bought every aftermarket piece that was available and them botched the basics so bad that it looked like crap. ""Yes, that's a nice photo-etched HUD you have there, too bad I can't see it through the glue smear you left on the canopy.""  AMPS (Armor Modelling and Preservation Society) has completely different rules and judging, and a builder would be wise to figure out the culture of judging for the show, if possible."
modelmakers,3a8kc0,alaskafish,1 point,Fri Jun 19 05:39:38 2015 UTC,"By ""use correct colors"", I mean, try not to use substitutes for large colors.   Let's say you're making a spitfire mk.1. Don't use a lime green and a sandy brown. But at least go close to olive drab and mud."

modelmakers,3a8kc0,cacheflow,1 point,Thu Jun 18 02:22:42 2015 UTC,"I have a small diorama that I want to enter in the automotive 1/32 scale. That diorama I started awhile back I was at a hobby shop and saw the flyers. I was thinking about entering two pieces since the diorama is so close to being done and I have until September to get everything done (plus its only a few bucks more for additional pieces so why not?). I haven decided the second piece quite yet, but was thinking about 1/35 half track or maybe an amphibious vehicle. I'm not sure what to build at the moment."
modelmakers,3a8kc0,Timmyc62,2,Thu Jun 18 13:06:18 2015 UTC,"It depends on the event and the judging rules.  See if you can get a copy of them as soon as possible.  Some events award first, second, third prizes per category.  For those, it might make sense to enter a less popular category on your first try.    Others give gold, silver, and bronze awards based on technical competency.  So there could be five bronze medals, two silver medals, and no gold medals in a category.  Also, know the judging criteria.  For some competitions, it is better to have a simple model done perfectly, rather than a complex model with a few flaws.  Also, I had asked a similar question a year ago, you might find more advice in there.  I linked it below.  I entered two models, but neither made it to the bronze level.  I'm hoping to try again this year.  http://www.reddit.com/r/modelmakers/comments/24az6y/suggestionsadvice_for_entering_a_modeling_contest/"
modelmakers,3a8kc0,SnarkMasterRay,2,Thu Jun 18 02:36:31 2015 UTC,"For some competitions, it is better to have a simple model done perfectly, rather than a complex model with a few flaws.   Yep, absolutely true for IPMs shows-you start with full points and are deducted for any build quality issues that the judges identify, like seams, brush strokes, silvering, and glue spots. Detail doesn't enter into it unless two or more models demonstrate equal build quality first."

If it's acrylic, you can use isopropyl alcohol to remove it...Wet a q-tip or some other small soft thing with alcohol and wipe the gloss coat off...It won't hurt the clear plastic.  Just be careful to not let the alcohol run, because it will take the paint off too..."
modelmakers,3a8ri6,MadMorf,3,Thu Jun 18 12:48:09 2015 UTC,"Isopropyl alcohol works really well, if you don't have any of that on hand, try some lighter fluid. I did that with my F86 Sabre model with the canopy already attached on, so it involved a bit of rubbing but it got it all off. Be careful though as you can rub off paint if its already attached to the fuselage."
modelmakers,3a8ri6,EM2Hero,1 point,Thu Jun 18 16:25:47 2015 UTC,"Depending on how thick the gloss is, you may be able to simply remove it off with your finger nail, or a rag.  If that doesn't work, try a very fine sandpaper or a polishing grit stick. Then after that, you can quickly dip it in some varnish. If it's off the kit, even better. But you can just dip it in the varnish even while it's attached."

There's a small sample of them in this post. I think I'm using a mix of the 6x8 and 6x10 stones cast in plaster.    I did a much larger section of road for a tank base in resin.  Placing the resin stones was a lot more troublesome than the plaster, but was a lot more durable.   After a while placing them individually I wised up and built a couple interlocking sections that I then made a mold of.  The street ended up being about 100 of those sections, so I'm glad I went that way :)"

It's 1/20 scale, so that's big enough to need whites and pupils-- you can't get away with just washes like 1/35 or smaller. And I think I'll do eyebrows with soft pencil but I'm still thinking about that. I have a sacrificial head for trying stuff out on first.   I airbrushed the flesh because the first one I did, the acrylic was a little gummy and there were brushmarks on the face..."

I think as long as you just put on thin layers it will look pretty nice. I would paint all the detail to be honest, You wont be able to get the soft lines with a pencil the same way you would a brush and pain. I do eyes even on 1:35 scale stuff but that's about my limit. I have some German Tankers I have to get around and paint soon!  I might have to pick one of these up. Looks like a nice clean cast. Did it require much cleaning?"

modelmakers,3a646s,sucky_lamer,2,Wed Jun 17 22:22:37 2015 UTC,"This is only my 2nd (nearly) completed ship, I decided to start with 1/700 due to one of the reasons you state, cost. I butchered a couple of others before this, and that hurts a lot less than a 100.00+ 1/350 kit.  I do, however, plan to start on my first 1/350 kit real soon, maybe after I finish this one, and one more 1/700 kit just to get my skills better."
modelmakers,3a646s,chokingonlego,3,Thu Jun 18 07:34:08 2015 UTC,"Thanks. Mostly the reason I want a larger scale ship is to modify it to RC, and I've found two candidates you might be interested in as well. There's a 1/500 Trumpeter USS Nimitz Carrier that's 29.8 inches long, the only downside is it's odd scale which makes it difficult to find better aircraft for. It retails between $40 and $60 on Amazon right now, which makes it a OK practice kit before you move to the bigger ones. It's almost the same length as the 1/350 USS Missouri, but at less than half the cost. The second one is the Trumpeter 1/350 USS Seawolf submarine, which is about the same length and price. They're both excellent for RC mods, due to the price and the size, the Nimitz even has a battery compartment, from the old motor kit you could get for it. As far as WW2 battleships go, the only selection are the 1/350 and 1/700 models unfortunately."

After a couple clear coats of Future early yesterday, I am laying down decals. There are three down and only about 80 or so to go.  These just got their first coat of decal softener (read: they are still in the early stages of settling and look silvery/crappy/crunchity).   I like the Slobberin' Wolf on the cowl. That thing was a bastard to get to lay down properly, having to be aligned with the back edge of the cowl. It was so thin it ripped in at least two places. I think I got it all aligned correctly, I only hope the decal set / softener works its magic and it lays down beautifully contoured to the open cowl flaps.    http://imgur.com/u1f95WI"

modelmakers,3a4eza,cacheflow,4,Wed Jun 17 03:39:45 2015 UTC,"Was finally able to complete my latest build.  Took me a while longer than I would have liked, simply because a new baby really cut into my available time.  This is a GMC Bofors 40mm by Hobby Boss.  These were used mainly by the French forces during WWII as mobile anti-aircraft platforms.  The story goes that the US supplied a number of French forces with the Bofors 40mm guns, as well as GMC trucks for towing them around.   However, towing it somewhere, setting it up, then tearing it down to move it can take quite a while.  Some enterprising Frenchman, whose name is lost to history, decided it would be much more efficient if they just placed the gun directly on the bed of the truck.   A number of these were made during the war, and used in France and other places throughout WWII.    Not too many pictures survive, but since they are almost all built in the field, they can vary significantly from truck to truck.  As for the kit, it was a very nice build.  Everything is constructed well and fits nicely.  Unlike the box shows, there are no figures with the kit, which seemed a bit odd to me.  The built is straightforward, and very detailed.  I didn't expend a ton of effort detailing the engine and the underside of the vehicle, but if you are interested in doing that, there certainly is the ability.   Lots of detail down there."

modelmakers,3a4eza,BenKerman,3,Wed Jun 17 13:11:28 2015 UTC,"My wife and I had a system that worked pretty well for us.    Once it was bedtime, we would take swing shifts.   The baby usually woke up every couple of hours throughout the night.  So, if the baby went to sleep at 8, then I'd stay up till the midnight feeding and cover any issues until then.  My wife would go to bed early.  Then, I'd go to sleep, and my wife would get any of the issues in the early AM.  If we timed it right,  my wife got uninterrupted sleep from 8-2/3 AM, and I got to sleep from midnight to 6/7am.  It worked well for us, especially since I'm a night owl and she is a morning person.  Since it was just me and a baby monitor, I could work on this on the evenings where there wasn't other house projects to do."

Generally things might be even less intact, depends on the fire.  You could possibly blacken things more but rain will wash off a lot of soot so it depends on how long the ""wreck"" is supposed to have been sitting out in the elements."
modelmakers,3a23ak,darkrift5,6,Tue Jun 16 17:02:30 2015 UTC,"Good choice, it's a fine kit straight out the box.   I would recommend picking up these interior stencils as well as these HGW seatbelts to enhance the already great interior details.  I would also recommend getting aftermarket decals like Eaglecals or even using Montex masks to stencil the markings. I used Tamiya's decals on my own model, but they are far too thick and nearly impossible to get to sink into the rivets and panel lines. They also break very easily.   Another mistake I made in my build is the rivets on the wings. During the war, they used putty which covered most of the rivets on the wings, making the rivets Tamiya shows somewhat inaccurate. There's a lot of resources available to show how the wings look like without most of the rivets. Here's also a good guide to building the kit that I found  I built the kit several months ago and here's an imgur album of the build. Images are a bit out of order because I just uploaded it again."

modelmakers,3a1pau,Fortunate_0ne,3,Tue Jun 16 15:21:44 2015 UTC,Looks like you would have gotten the same results with any other brand of silver paint. Or maybe the photo doesnt do it justice.  With alclad you need to make the surface smooth as glass between coats of primer and gloss black.
modelmakers,3a1pau,Myflyisbreezy,3,Tue Jun 16 18:55:11 2015 UTC,"Actually, I've had much better success applying it to finely polished bare plastic.  Granted, you've REALLY gotta buff it, and any variation in underlying color sticks out."
modelmakers,3a1pau,screamingcheese,1 point,Wed Jun 17 14:37:09 2015 UTC,"The photo really doesn't do it justice. It was buttery smooth to paint. The undercoat was gloss black and the finish was smooth enough. Drop tanks weren't supposed to look like polished aluminum.   Of course, there is a learning curve I'm just beginning.

In this case I was doing a pin-wash of my Portuguese Spitfire when the whitespirit made a strange reaction with the new varnish that I had bought and first applied on the Spitfire (sorry the quality of the photo I don't have better), but the lesson learned was of always try a new product first in a piece of plastic before applying it on the model. The second, when you are tired you should stop and not force yourself to glue one more pe-part, like in this case I lose my patience and applied to much glue..."

modelmakers,3a1lll,Fortunate_0ne,1 point,Tue Jun 16 20:55:50 2015 UTC,"I'd recommend it, for the price. It really is a pretty solid kit and builds up rather quickly into a respectable model.   Doogsmodels.com did a good double build with that Revellogram kit and the Tamiya 'Bolt. It's worth a look."
modelmakers,3a1lll,willhopkins,1 point,Tue Jun 16 21:18:20 2015 UTC,Interesting. I'll have to check that out. Either this or a 1/48 Revell Mustang kit I never started will be my first model in a while (after a cheap Airfix starter to remind me of the basics). This seems like a good growth model. Gotta get some gear to actually build/paint it first.
modelmakers,3a1lll,Fortunate_0ne,1 point,Tue Jun 16 22:14:48 2015 UTC,"I'm just getting back into it after about 15 years off. Those years have taught me a modicum of patience that I didn't used to have. I've also started using an airbrush for the first time ever. It's a learning curve, but the difference between that and old brush painting can make a huge difference in how skilfull a model looks. In fact, it seems that often (myself included) painting has replaced skilfull building (meaning that there are examples on here of great painting/weathering over crap builds).   It's fun, though. This forum has been invaluable to me in getting back into this hobby."

modelmakers,3a3orz,solipsistnation,5,Wed Jun 17 02:56:47 2015 UTC,"Plastic: tamiya extra thin, Tenax 7R, testors liquid cement (it's liquid, not any kind of ""gel""), and although I've not used it personally Plastruct Bondene. Of the list, I particularly prefer tamiya extra thin and Tenax. Both are not non toxic, and most solvent based plastic glues are not nontoxic. Alll of these work on the principle of providing a solvent that melts the plastic and the fuses the two parts to be joined together. It works ONLY for compatible plastics, most particularly for the polystyrene in plastic kits. Because these all dissolve plastic, NONE of them are non-toxic, and all of them have highly chemical smells to them.   The non-toxic glue you're using does not use that kind of solvent, which is why it's non toxic. As you've discovered, it also doesn't stick things together very well.   When using liquid cement, be aware: this stuff will get everywhere, and you are advised to use it sparingly. Tamiya's liquid cement (particularly extra thin, but a more thicker version in an orange bottle is also available) includes a brush integrated into the cap. If you ever drop a drop of this stuff onto a plastic surface, DO NOT touch it with your fingers, as the solvent will soften the plastic and leave fingerprint marks if you touch that area. Perhaps remove it with a tissue or something.   How to use liquid cement: when joining surfaces such as fuselages, it's more like ""flowing"" the stuff into the gap and letting capillary action do the rest.   Wood: Testors wood cement, titebond, PVA wood glue, and rare but still available, Ambroid cement.  General guide on model glues:   http://www.scalemodelguide.com/construction/materials/learn-glue/  For most people on this sub and plastic modelers NOT working with resin materials, the main relevant ones are:    Liquid cement.  Tube cement (there's very little reason to use this stuff, but some people like it.)  Canopy glues (usually, something made by a model company either is a form of white glue, or some solvent based types like Humbrol Clearfix)."

I had installed the EZ Line during the final stages after glosscoating, did my weathering, then applied the dull coat. As soon as I was done spraying the EZ line looked like that - as if the elastic had a chemical reaction. I didn't panic right away and just decided to wait until the clearcoat was dry (this picture it was still wet and fresh, as you can see), and sure enough when it all dried the EZ line had regained its tension. It corrected almost completely on the other Whirlwind I built - on this one I had to pull the primary antenna about 1/8"" tighter but otherwise it was generally okay. It was super weird nonetheless.  You can see more on my other post about the Westland Whirlwinds, but yeah - this was the immediate result."

modelmakers,39xvxv,DooM_SpooN,3,Mon Jun 15 18:12:00 2015 UTC,"If you're just getting started, Tamiya is a great company to get started with. Additionally Airfix and Revell often make great kits for newbies as well (although some are sheer hellspawn). Really, I can't honestly say that any specific companies in particular are better than others - they all have some that are great and some that are awful. If you're just getting the hang of things, skill level numbers might be more relevant. If you buy a Revell or Airfix level 5 kit you might have a rough time if you're new to it. But 1s and 2s are a good place to get the hang of things, and they tend to be cheaper kits that you're not throwing so much money at that you'll ragequit if you make a mistake."

Trumpeter make some good modern Russian and Cold War Soviet armor. Meng's modern tanks are also very good. AFV Club tend to be good.

Since the tank was already built once, the wheels were glued on, also I usually paint everything once it's built, maybe not the easiest way but it's what I'm used to. For me, link and lengths are glued then painted with the rest, removable tracks painted separately from tank then slipped on.   Sag was glued after all was painted, it's fairly hidden back there, use your own discretion for other tanks."

modelmakers,39uzyf,IndyJonesy,1 point,Mon Jun 15 00:45:34 2015 UTC,"You'll need a compressor too, so HERE is basically what I have, except I have the TC-20T compressor, that has an air tank attached."
modelmakers,39uzyf,MadMorf,3,Mon Jun 15 01:01:10 2015 UTC,"This is a very good starter kit. A lot of people will talk down about the Pasche H set and for good and bad reasons.   The plus sides of it are huge mind you and anyone who advises against it outright is either a fanboy or simply a fool.  It sprays decent enough and will spray just about anything that is in liquid form. It's like an AK-47 of airbrushes.  It's well built but you will want to buy the aluminum handle section as a lot of solvents will make the plastic handle brittle. It will crack and break eventually if the threads in the plastic last long enough for that to happen. It's $10 on amazon  It's easy to use and extremely easy to clean, the external mix design is very simple and because the entire portion that is in contact with the paint is removable from the rest of the brush this means it's super easy to clean.   The Needles are much harder to lose and less prone to damage than  standard internal mix airbrush. They are also dirt cheap to replace.   The paint cup options are really great and the metal open cup is down out of the way more so than a gravity feed version.  The bad side of it however is.. it's built like an AK-47. It's not for finesses and can't be used for soft line/freehand camo, etc. It's spray pattern is just too large even with the smallest needle and adjusting it way down with very thin paint it's still mediocre at best.  It's atomization of paint is less than stellar. Not bad for basecoats and large area coverage but if you try to do a fade with it you'll clearly see individual large specs of paint. This is the biggest downside to a single action external mix airbrush.   It being single action means that you don't have instant control over how much paint comes out.. this is a mixed blessing as it can be adjusted with the needle but takes a bit of trial and error depending on your paint mix/thinning.   One last word. Adam Savage of Mythbusters and previously Industrial light and Magic(Star wars model builders/special effects) uses this airbrush for most all of his work. He does amazing model building and painting... Take that for what it's worth mind you, But from what he has said on the matter, no one at ILM uses a dual action super fine (.2/.3mm) airbrush because they simply aren't versatile enough."
modelmakers,39uzyf,HandBanaba,2,Mon Jun 15 03:41:07 2015 UTC,"Not bad, but it's single action. This is what I went with. The one with the larger cup is absolutely glorious. So glorious that I haven't touched the other two brushes it came with."

modelmakers,39s04s,InUrFridge,8,Sun Jun 14 11:27:17 2015 UTC,"If you don't want to use airbrushes, you can use a mechanical pencil to add these effects. After painting your base color, trace the lines in the plastic with a mech. pencil, then use a soft, dry brush to smudge the lead to the desired effect. I highly recommend spraying on a clear cover coat to protect and maintain the effect."
modelmakers,39s04s,Easilyremembered,6,Sun Jun 14 05:30:17 2015 UTC,"You can use a wash, which is when you paint a really thin colour over the finished model, and the clean it off, leaving just the paint in the recessed detail. You would have to gloss coat the model, and make sure you don't thin the paint with something that will strip the base coat off.  I use acrylic paint, water and a drop of dish soap. The colour of the wash shouldn't contrast too much with the base colour. For example, a light grey wash for a white surface, and black for a dark grey surface."
modelmakers,39s04s,sleepwalker77,4,Sun Jun 14 05:15:30 2015 UTC,Panel wash will do it..  The dark paint sits in the grooves that are moulded into the kit.
modelmakers,39s04s,yawningangel,7,Sun Jun 14 06:07:56 2015 UTC,"One way is preshading.   Paint the panel lines (and the darkened area you see) in a color like black.   Paint the final color over it, taking care not to completely cover the black or until you see a similar shading of the panel lines and access hatches.   This is generally possible only with an airbrush because of the control required to land paint into the correct panel lines, and to also selectively coat the final color on top of the shaded lines."
modelmakers,39s04s,windupmonkeys,3,Sun Jun 14 04:47:12 2015 UTC,I find pre-shading and washes the best way to do that.  See here: http://www.florymodels.co.uk/washes/
modelmakers,39s04s,juanchopancho,3,Sun Jun 14 07:26:13 2015 UTC,"It's a 2-stage effect.  The first step is to perform pre-shading before the paint scheme (requires an airbrush). The technique involves spraying dark, somewhat blurry lines that trace the panel lines on the model. When you later on spray the paint scheme over them they show through and create that gradient between the panel lines and the centers of the panels.  After that's done a panel line wash creates the real dark color inside the panel lines. Basically, you take a highly diluted painters' oil color and mineral spirit mix (more like mineral spirit dirtied with some oil paint in it) and run it through the recessed panel lines (Doesn't work with raised ones). You wipe off the excess with the direction of the airflow and get very neat, dark panel lines with gentle smears that act as an oil filter and give the model a more gritty look. The more you wipe the cleaner it looks."
modelmakers,39s04s,CptSonne,2,Sun Jun 14 09:52:05 2015 UTC,Inking is a good way but requires a steady hand and patience  I used to use the citadel inks ( or coat de arms ) and lightly dip a small fine ended brush into the ink wash and then trace the lines   It was quite effective and if you accidentally went over a edge you could wipe it off with a tissue or paint over the mistake
modelmakers,39s04s,Jam_Pie_Cream,2,Sun Jun 14 09:47:09 2015 UTC,"A thin black wash over a gloss coat will prevent the paint from being caught by any rough surface texture. Capillary action will let the wash flow nicely into the panel lines. If you use lacquer or enamel for your gloss, use very thin acrylics for the wash; if you use acrylic for your gloss, use very thin oil paint. I usually use a 50-50 mix of black and burnt umber for a slightly grimy effect."

modelmakers,39rs17,Khasnod44,3,Sun Jun 14 03:08:14 2015 UTC,You can't use regular glue for plastic models on resin. You have to use Cyanoacrylate or SuperGlue.
modelmakers,39rs17,MadMorf,2,Sun Jun 14 03:14:06 2015 UTC,Try to do a basecoat before doing the final tank colour. A basecoat will make the paint stick a lot better.
modelmakers,39rs17,Hubzee,2,Sun Jun 14 03:11:43 2015 UTC,Washing the parts in warm water and dish soap will also help paint adhesion by removing any oils and model release agent.
modelmakers,39rs17,peasfrog,1 point,Sun Jun 14 06:44:03 2015 UTC,"Use a wide brush, up to 1/4inch wide for the large areas, use small brushes for detail painting. Painting with a small brush will increase likelihood of brushstrokes that you won't like.   Resin is not the same as plastic models. As listed by other submitters:    It can't be glued by regular plastic glue. Use Superglue/Cyanoacrylate.  It MUST be washed prior to painting or anything else you're doing, because it often is coated with silicone ""grease""/lubricant that is used to make removing the finished resin item from molds easier.  It's much more brittle than plastic.  Primer's probably a good idea, i.e. a layer of gray, white, or similar paint (or specially formulated primer) so the final colors have something to stick to.    Many tutorials can be found.

modelmakers,39lakt,windupmonkeys,1 point,Sat Jun 13 01:11:47 2015 UTC,"Bottle fed brushes are siphon fed, which means that they generally (but not always) require higher operating pressures, correct alignment of the siphon to ensure proper feeding of paint, and can (but not always) uses more paint.   Siphons/bottle feeds also depend on having a certain MINIMUM amount of paint in order for the feed to work. This means that any batch of paint you custom mix either (1) has to be used up in that single session, or (2) must be stored in an airtight container until the next session. This is not a problem if you spray paints without thinning and out of the bottle, but it's much more inconvenient if you spray a custom mix of thinned paint. Some modelers, even if they know the proper mixing ratios for a particular thinned paint, like to use the same batch because you know that that mixed batch will be consistent with itself, but not necessarily with another batch mixed to identical proportions.   People use gravity feeds because they operate with lower pressures, can use a tiny drop or two of paint. For example, I used to use bottle feed.  I usually had to use several ML of paint and thinner to meet the threshold for the bottle feed. Gravity feed (in a clean brush, mind) requires nothing more than a few drops into the paint channel and some thinner, and that should be enough.   Unless you're coating large sections of a model, you're rarely going to fill that paint reservoir anyway. I use cheap chinese made airbrushes, and find them servicable (but seriously ,get a bettter one if you can afford it). The first one I bought had a pretty large cup (4 of 5 ccs, I think). The latest one? I bought a 2cc cup because honestly, I never spray enough paint to fill it anyway, so why bother?   There are people who use bottle feeds and can get great results. Gravity feed is just a bit easier to use in my opinion. However, either one is fine."

Sites to purchase: Starshipmodeler.com store (you'll pay a bit of a premium for buying from the guy who runs the site; he has an integrated store and it used to be a very good website for sci fi modelers). He has everything from resin bits, to mainstream Japanese sci fi kits, to star wars kits and so on. You can search by subject, scale, material, etc.   Culttvman Store. I've never shopped there, but it used to be a pretty good site that displayed builds and articles as well.   Hobbylink Japan.

modelmakers,39lakt,XenophonTheAthenian,1 point,Fri Jun 12 18:19:35 2015 UTC,"I've never had a problem with brushpainting bubbles. Usually the act of wiping off excess paint before I actually put the brush to plastic will fix the problem and take any bubbles off. Properly-thinned paint, I've always noticed, doesn't really bubble as much, but that might just be my mind playing tricks on me, because I can't think of why that might be so"

modelmakers,39lakt,35thArmorGuy,1 point,Fri Jun 12 19:17:14 2015 UTC,I recently bought an acrylic Russian green from MIG (MIG Ammo series). The bottle has a little ball in there to help with mixing when shaking. Don't know if they do this with their entire line though.  My Vallejo paints I just shake though. Haven't had any bubble problems brush painting.
modelmakers,39lakt,surprised_platypus,1 point,Sat Jun 13 01:17:36 2015 UTC,"On my first model you have to put decals on the instrument panel. Should I wait until the cockpit is finished, then gloss coat, then put on the decals? Or is there an other approach?"
modelmakers,39lakt,flounderflound,1 point,Fri Jun 12 18:44:57 2015 UTC,"I typically install the decal before installing the instrument panel into the cockpit assembly. The reason for this is that it will allow you to place it without obstructions. Also if it is a textured panel (ie not just a flat surface) then this will allow you to apply the needed pressure to make sure the decal fully seats. I'll be honest - I've never glosscoated for an instrument panel decal though, especially if it's a smooth, flat panel. I have dullcoated over it after the fact, though."

modelmakers,39lakt,windupmonkeys,1 point,Fri Jun 12 19:32:38 2015 UTC,"My general order of assembly of the cockpit:    Paint the instrument panel whatever color it's supposed to be.  Paint the cockpit tub whatever color(s) it's supposed to be.  Pick out controls with silver/white highlights, detail paint the controls looking at reference photos where possible, use graphite dust as a highlighter where appropriate.  Put future floor polish mixed with the relevant clear color in the radar displays (it's not 100% accurate since powered off screens are black, but it's interesting to look at and a nice effect.)  Gloss coat ALL of the cockpit surfaces where decals will be placed. Decal the instrument panel. If it's supposed to conform over bumps and knobs and actual surface detail, make sure to use decal setting solution or it won't stick properly. Wait for the decal to dry. Then flat coat if appropriate.  Drop using a very small brush, future into the ""glass"" dials of the instrument panel.    **The instrument panel should be decaled as a separate part where possible (easier to do it that way, since you'll have the most access to it) and then glued to the final cockpit tub.   Your order is fine. I would leave the instrument panel OFF if it's separate, because it'll make it easier to place the decals (on a flat surface) instead of trying to wedge it into an already assembled cockpit."

modelmakers,39lakt,SchnitzelOfDoom,1 point,Sat Jun 13 01:27:53 2015 UTC,Anyone have any experience with liquid mask? Started on my first 1/72 plane and am dreading masking the canopy. Found a bottle at my lhs and decided that anything is better than tape.
modelmakers,39lakt,MadMorf,1 point,Fri Jun 12 22:05:39 2015 UTC,"I've used MicroMask successfully a few times. It's water soluble, but needs a fair amount of water to remove, so the small amount of water you may use to dilute acrylic paint is harmless. To remove it, I wet it in the center of the masked space and then rub it with s paper towel, to lift the film off."
modelmakers,39lakt,windupmonkeys,1 point,Fri Jun 12 23:47:37 2015 UTC,"Depending on the formulation liquid mask isn't very good. MadMorf seems to have found a way to make it work (care to provide more details? it'd be useful). Microscale's liquid mask I've found is too imprecise to actually use to mask a canopy frame. Tape is, as tedious as it is, the most precise way to do it outside of bare metal foil (which is even thinner, making the frames more obvious and easier to cut out).   The best tape I've used for this sort of work is tamiya masking tape, not painters tape (the paper it's printed on is too thick to really show details prior to cutting).   Liquid mask does have some uses, though. Masking large areas for example, or after you mask the frames on the canopy, filling in the rest of the ""window"" so that you don't need to use a large amount (and tediously apply) tape to cover the glass.   I echo your sentiments about masking canopies though. Aside from filling and sanding, it's my most hated modelmaking activity. There's a reason why precut masks are so popular and sell so well."

From all the reference I've seen the two nubs either side of the middle should be painted the same color as the cranck case and the one in the middle should be black. Maybe it varied depending on model?  Nice work though."
modelmakers,39gz2k,peasfrog,1 point,Sat Jun 13 13:38:12 2015 UTC,"I've looked at dozens of different pictures of the P&W Double Wasp and there seems to be some variation in colors as far as what is black and what is gray. It's entirely possible that I just don't know enough to know why there are differences.   My general reference was this picture: http://imgur.com/QITkHhT  I took some artistic license as to what I found visually interesting at scale, and left the center nub gray.  If I had to pick a flaw in my rendition it's that the hub on mine is a too tan gray when it should be a more blue gray. The paint i used was an old model master neutral grey of some sort and it didn't turn out like I wanted. Oh well...  You're right on the cylinders. Typically I would have spent more time to completely remove the mold lines. In this case, the mold lines are completely obscured when installed in the cowl and removing them completely, besides satisfying my OCD, is basically a waste of time (at least in my view).   Engine installed in cowl: http://imgur.com/DM5ZTaP"
modelmakers,39gzv2,alaskafish,6,Thu Jun 11 17:32:42 2015 UTC,"Looks like some variant of Panzer Grey, which is an often-used chipping color. Personally I like Tamiya's German Grey for chipping (especially since I don't use it for my Panzer Grey, so it stands out fine :3), but this could be Vallejo's as well or some different variant of Panzer Grey--them greys all look so similar to each other.

modelmakers,39gzv2,XenophonTheAthenian,4,Thu Jun 11 19:16:06 2015 UTC,"Depends on what your Panzer Grey is I guess. Like on my Garupan build that I'm doing now I actually just used Tamiya's German Grey. But I painted my tank with shades of dark black-blue, not German Grey, so...I've used AK Interactive's Panzer Grey modulation colors in the past, and I used Tamiya German Grey there as well. but if yours is painted in Tamiya German Grey obviously that's a problem. Perhaps Nato Black? Or a similar darkish grey, maybe with a little reddish colors mixed in. I've seen guys use a sort of brownish-red color to replicate rusted and exposed primer--more brown than the normal reddish primer that was applied to German armor, to make it seem corroded."
modelmakers,39gzv2,Ruinsfall,4,Thu Jun 11 19:27:42 2015 UTC,"Vallejo Model Color panzer series  70.822 German Camo Black Brown is the closest color I have found for chipping.

This looks like hairspray with some powder effects added(could be wrong).  If that is the case it was probably based in the rust color then had a layer of hairspray put on then painted over with a normal paintjob.  Then the top layer of paint is removed with a wet q-tip and possible a scraping tool.    This could also be a salt method job(the rear looks like it was salt chipped, maybe a mixture of the techniques).  Again that would be  a rust basecoat with the other coats on top."

As for the metal chipped spots, it could be panzer grey with a metalizer sprayed on top, but I am unsure.   I personally would use something like Tamiya's acryllic X-10 Gunmetal or XF-56 Metallic Grey.   As for the ultra shiny edges (seen on the top of the fender), that might be where the builder took a pencil tip and gently applied the graphite in a long stroke motion."

modelmakers,39jafv,SchnitzelOfDoom,2,Fri Jun 12 02:56:01 2015 UTC,"You will definitely ruin your canopy. It'll fog the canopy if you attempt to use it, and then you'll have to spend time polishing it back to original state.   Tenax is just another plastic welding solvent. While some chemical aspect of it might be proprietary, it's no different than any other plastic welding solvent/cement that you'd use.   Some people say that coating canopies in future will allow you to use it without crazing, I'ved had mixed results from that.   There are canopy glues that are not white glue (or PVA, as it's known in the trade). Humbrol Clearfix is one. I never liked it much. Revell also makes a canopy glue, though I suspect that's just repackaged white glue.   Other white glues with potentially better working properties:    Titebond or weldbond (it's one or the other, the name escapes me at the moment, but it'll say it's a general purpose adhesive that is water resistant, but not waterproof) glue. It's a PVA adhesive that is basically a better, quicker drying, and more permanent form of white glue. I believe it's also water resisting, but not waterproof.  Tacky glue (available in craft stores). It's a thicker kind of white glue. I haven't used it, but it is one possible alternative.    Others:  1. I very rarely hear it recommended, but some people say epoxy might work. However, I'd be skeptical. Lots of epoxy doesn't dry clear and will yellow over time and exposure.   Honestly, your best bet is to stick with white glue, buy a solvent based adhesive such as humbrol that is formualted not to craze canopies, and so on."
modelmakers,39jafv,windupmonkeys,2,Fri Jun 12 03:35:10 2015 UTC,"Any plastic solvent glue on an untreated plastic model clear part WILL craze it and fog the canopy or clear part.   Tenax has similar working properties to any other solvent based glue. Superglue (and most CA/Cynaoacrylate derivatives, which is what superglue is) will also craze it."
modelmakers,39jafv,windupmonkeys,1 point,Fri Jun 12 03:36:19 2015 UTC,Thanks for the fantastic reply! I've got some future and digging through the stash found that my A-20 came with two different glazed nose options so I have something to work with. I suppose I'll go get some titebond tomorrow and report back with my findings after I use it.
modelmakers,39jafv,windupmonkeys,3,Fri Jun 12 03:40:45 2015 UTC,"You need to be careful. Some people say that coating it with future will prevent fogging. Why? because it's an acrylic layer over the original polystyrene plastic.   I've seen it work and fail. The problem is that if whatever solvent or adhesive is manages to eat through the future, it might cause crazing. or it might not work at all.   titebond  or weldbond is not as forgiving as white glue (the traditional stuff you used at school.)   See example below:   the claim is that future coating will allow you to use CA glue (superglue and similar derivatives) without fogging. if that's true, I'd use that because it's the most secure bond.   http://www.britmodeller.com/forums/index.php?/topic/33181-gluing-canopies/.   There are also other specifically formulated, model company ""canopy glues"". Clearfix is one (I find it too goopy to be effective).   Basically, find some kind of nonreactive glue that nevertheless bonds plastics. I see gator/gorilla glues mentioned in the thread, but you need to read it and conduct your own diligence. if you're not sure, test on clear sprue, either coated or uncoated with future, to see what result.   These days I mostly stick with white glue, but you're right, the real problem is that it's hard to apply precisely, doesn't set quickly, and so on. Tite/weldbond solves that part of the problem as it dries much faster than traditional white glue, if i remember correctly.   Buy a small sample. Weldbond/Titebond has a limited shelf life."

modelmakers,39j61e,kwkfor,3,Fri Jun 12 03:28:29 2015 UTC,This.    My models get to rest at least two days after glueing on the landing gear without any pressure on it. Even if they're just 1/72.    Otherwise you can get white metal parts to replace them.
modelmakers,39j61e,FlyingLowSH,2,Fri Jun 12 07:30:59 2015 UTC,"Gear up, problem solved. ;)  Of course, I'm only kidding. My gear-up preference is in a very small minority. Actually, I've found that many kits aren't designed to have a gear-up option and it becomes a lot of work just to make the parts fit properly in the up position.  I see a lot of good suggestions already, from super glue to leaving it off the wheels for some time. I think your biggest issue is going to be putting weight on them too early. Model cement actually melts the plastic and bonds it all together. While it will hold after a very short time, it has to have enough time to harden after that. Many components will be solid enough to serve their purpose fairly quickly, but with tiny little struts having to support the weight of the plane, it's a definite weak point. I'd recommend overnight to 24 hours, at the very least."
modelmakers,39j61e,flounderflound,1 point,Fri Jun 12 16:01:31 2015 UTC,"In the future, use cyanoacrylate (super glue) to attach landing gear. It doesn't weld the plastic together, but that means it also doesn't melt the plastic so you don't have to worry about the issue you're facing now.  For now? I guess turn the model over so there's no load on the gear and let it sit for a few days until all the solvents have fully evaporated."
modelmakers,39j61e,Dr_Von_Spaceman,1 point,Fri Jun 12 15:20:01 2015 UTC,"Just echoing what the others say.  I typically attach landing gear last, after decals, weathering and handling.    I then fit up the landing gear applying some needle-applicator glue to both bays and struts, allow to 'go off' for about a minute, then press as firmly as possible to fit it up. This gets a good bond. Check and re-check for straightness immediately, especially on tricky planes like the Fw-190 where the strut needs to be correct in both frontal and side-on perspectives.   Now, sit the model on raised jigs (model paint jars), and leave for 5 minutes. Come back and re-check. Adjust, or leave overnight, preferably two days. Fit wheels. Leave for two days. Play with your model on the rug.  The key points are getting the good bond by letting the cement penetrate the plastic a little, and patience so the glue can not just dry, but harden."

modelmakers,39f3mb,ionizzatore,2,Thu Jun 11 20:29:15 2015 UTC,"Get rid of the brush that came with it and try to find a better brush, or a couple of brushes. Brushes that come with kits are usually quite bad.   Airbrushing isn't difficult, and you can get started for about US$100, but it does take practice.   Yes, you can use masking tape, but be careful-- very sticky tape will pull off dried paint. There is a kind of blue painters tape that has very weak glue that should work."
modelmakers,39f2of,fruitbythefootfucker,4,Thu Jun 11 08:09:19 2015 UTC,"Looks pretty good for your first model. Couple of pointers I can see.  Don't use super glue, unless it's for really tiny parts or PE. I can use 4 or 5 different glues on one model depending on the properties I need. Of course you don't need that to start. Buy some plastic cement it won't dry nearly as fast as super glue giving you more time to close up gaps and position thing how you'd like.  Thin the paint.. Looks like you brushed it on. Especially when brushing two or three thin coats are better then one think.  The logos cool. As long as your happy with it doesn't matter! Doesn't have to be accurate ;)"

modelmakers,39f2of,BonsaiWeed,4,Thu Jun 11 14:59:39 2015 UTC,"If the paint is water soluable (sp?) (acrylic) thin it down with water or alternatively it may be turpentine or some other oil based (enamel paints and some others). This makes the paint... thinner... so you need to apply several coats of it to cover the model. The upside of this is, since it is thinner, less tiny details are lost underneath the paint and overall the whole result is a smoother surface. Take your time, do not worry and have fun =)"
modelmakers,39f2of,BonsaiWeed,2,Thu Jun 11 15:17:31 2015 UTC,Oh okay! Yeah its enamel paint so I need to get some turpentine thank you for the advice!
modelmakers,39f2of,Smokeyrelic,2,Thu Jun 11 15:31:26 2015 UTC,"Just never thin paint in the original container. Pour some, however much you think you will be using during that particular session - you can always mix more if you run out -, to another container and thin that. And since the paint you are using was enamel, you need to let it dry properly before adding another coat of paint (otherwise sandpapering ensues).  [Edit] The paint maker also often provides specific thinners for their paints, but they are often more expensive than just using non-brand stuff. But using their stuff ensures that you got the right chemical to thin it with."

Too early of a model :/). If your vehicle can fit 40 cm tracks I'd be willing to part with them for cheap--I assembled about sixty links or so on one side and everything's washed, trimmed, and drilled.

modelmakers,39f76r,AsimovsRobot,4,Thu Jun 11 09:02:40 2015 UTC,"See when lightening colors, white isn't really recommended. Because essentially your changing the hue of the paint not really lightening it. I'd try a lighter yellow for the brown and khaki, just remember start off with a tiny amount for the lighter color. It may not look much brighter in the airbrush cup but on the model there will be a real noticeable difference. Also when lightening my panel I'll thin I'd down even further this way I can build it up slowly just how I like it.  As far as preshading, I primarily preshade and paint with Vallejo. Maybe keep the paint thinner but a few more coats. Pre-shading is supposed to be very subtle. If this doesn't work for you, maybe try post shading."
modelmakers,39f76r,frugm1,3,Thu Jun 11 11:27:21 2015 UTC,"Yep, lightening paint with white does just what you say it does.  To lighten paint, mix it with a lighter version of the same color-- so Russian Green plus Light Green, Sand Yellow plus normal yellow, and so on.   There are some colors that I think are mostly meant for mixing-- Tamiya's ""Buff"" is one, and I used Vallejo's ""Radome Tan"" for a similar purpose. It's rich enough that it won't wash out the main color but light enough that you don't have to use a lot of it at once."
modelmakers,39f76r,solipsistnation,2,Thu Jun 11 14:00:33 2015 UTC,Thanks! What about darkening paint? I just read that black also shifts the hue a bit.

This is my first attempt at pre-shading, and the wheels were painted with a technique I picked up from /u/solipsistnation on his Panzer tutorial. I don't like the black of the tires though, so I need to do a wash on that and a mud wash on the hubs."

I already had the section of street built from molded plaster individual paving stones (couldn't find any premolded cobblestone streets that looked like Red Square...I think that's kind of strange, considering what Red Square is famous for). I thought it looked a bit boring though, so I decided I'd scratchbuild a podium and lecturn for Putin.    It was going well until last night when I was opening up a new bottle of super thin CA glue in a hotel room.  I didn't have all my tools handy so I figured I could cut it open with an xacto knife.    Oops!!! A bunch of it squirted out and I made a bit of a mess on my cobblestone.  And I didn't bring any acetone!  Also, I'm scared what acetone would do to my already painted and weathered street... I might try hiding it with some more dust pigment :-/  Anyways...I'm liking how the lecturn is looking.  It looks kinda weird in these pictures...the mics look HUGE.

modelmakers,398una,holocause,2,Wed Jun 10 15:24:26 2015 UTC,Wow that's amazing. Those panel lines are superb. Amazing job on the random panels. The light work is quite impressive. It looks like a great kit. I'm surprised you didn't add any lighting to the thrusters/exhausts. (Sorry not familiar with star wars space fighters). The pilots and the r2d2 look amazing. Have you or will you do a TIE?
modelmakers,398una,silverflowers,2,Wed Jun 10 20:25:03 2015 UTC,"I had glued the engine pods together before I had the notion of lighting up the kit so I couldn't go back to it. That being said, the way Bandai engineered the molding of this kit, lighting the engines up is feasible. Also, Bandai has a 1:48 version of the X-wing that does light up and have mechanical wing articulations out-of-the-box. A TIE squadron is definitely somthing I want to do in the future."
modelmakers,398una,holocause,1 point,Wed Jun 10 21:32:13 2015 UTC,"Aha! You actually posted on my thread when I started working on this model! And I'm very glad you did because your models served as inspiration for my own. I didn't go so far as to light them up, and you can probably tell where I forgot to put the blue 'ribbons' on the laser cannons until it was too late, but I was using your models as a guide for mine. Thanks!"
modelmakers,398una,holocause,2,Wed Jun 10 21:38:43 2015 UTC,Ah. I did notice the lack of ribbon but chalked it up to artistic license. Great work. Glad my photos helped in guiding your build. When I first looked at your pics I was thinking your build and mine would not look out of place side by side.   What paints and panel lining technique did you end up using?   I liked with what you did propping the kit up with a clear acrylic rod. Nice touch.
modelmakers,398una,plasticaddict,1 point,Wed Jun 10 22:05:02 2015 UTC,"Sure, artistic licence, let's go with that... lol!  I used USAF light grey from Vallejo as my base colour, then used Humbrol enamel wash and thinners for the panel lining. It went... ok. The black wash was a little thick for my liking and in some places the capillary action wasn't enough to pull the wash into the creases. I don't know if that's because my gloss coat left a little to be desired ( I was spraying it with too much PSI so it was a bit patchy in some places) or the wash was just a bit old (shouldn't have been, I bought it new but who knows how long it was sitting in a warehouse for) but I might try the Tamiya one next time.  Overall I tried a couple of new things on this kit, so it was a good learning experience. I'll hopefully have the techniques down pat when I start work on the TIE fighter I ordered last week!"

modelmakers,398una,GT86,3,Wed Jun 10 04:15:31 2015 UTC,If I may offer one overwhelmingly simple suggestion: more light.  I don't know what sort of camera you are using but brighter lights (or daylight from a window) will make your shots clearer and less grainy.
modelmakers,398una,starduks,2,Wed Jun 10 13:25:53 2015 UTC,"You're almost certainly right. I was just using a cheap camera and indoor lighting. Thanks, I'll try outdoor light next time."
modelmakers,398una,Rocat,3,Wed Jun 10 21:44:50 2015 UTC,Tips? Im staring this kit down right next to me...im pretty new to model building...i really dont want to screw it up.
modelmakers,398una,flounderflound,3,Wed Jun 10 08:41:39 2015 UTC,"The wings on my kit didn't line up evenly. One wing was higher than the other. Not so much that you'd probably notice on a glance, but once I saw it it bugged the hell out of me.  Also, I got over-eager and put the whole thing together before I painted it (apart from the pilot and cockpit canopy) which made painting some areas a pain.  If I were you, I'd dry-fit the wings to make sure they are opening evenly, and then I'd undercoat and apply the base colour, then gloss varnish before I did the final assembly. Because I put it all together first, it made it difficult to get into the wings with my airbrush, which meant when I came to panel lining the model that the paint rubbed off some areas leaving the undercoat showing. Which on this model wasn't a huge deal since it needs that weathered and worn look, but it still shouldn't have happened.  Of course, that depends on how you plan to paint the model as well.  EDIT: Only tangentially related, but when I was putting the Vallejo glass varnish through my airbrush, I had the pressure too high and didn't get a very good coat. If you're going to do the same, make sure your PSI is in the 10-15 area and give the model two or three coats to get a good even coverage. This will make panel lining the model easier and make it easier to apply the decals."

The wheels would be the rustiest, then the undercarriage, etc. Look for 90degree corners where moisture might accumulate, weather them. Look for holes and places where lubrication might leak out,  next to moving parts.  That is a good place for a stain, which should flow down towards the ground.  Look for places of wear, where people step, drybrush with steel or silver to replicate it.  I'm not sure that helps. :)"

modelmakers,39a0a8,frugm1,1 point,Wed Jun 10 10:38:56 2015 UTC,Well it looks like you have already given it a gloss coat. What kind of paint were you planning on using for the filter?  You could spray a very thin white coat on it to tone it down then give it a dark wash. Just make sure it's very thin. I'd almost mist it over. Lower psi from a distance.
modelmakers,39a0a8,frugm1,1 point,Wed Jun 10 11:31:42 2015 UTC,"I actually have not done any clear coats yet and the paint I used is a matt colour, I think the glossy look comes from my poor airbrush work (too much paint going on at once). I plan to use a filter from MIG productions."
modelmakers,39a0a8,frugm1,2,Wed Jun 10 11:41:35 2015 UTC,"Ah gotcha, well definitely make sure that you clear coat it first. Airbrushing would be fine but just go real easy so as not to over do it.  Like I mentioned, low psi, misting.  honestly I have no experience with Mig products I use oils for my filters/washes, the longer drying time allows me to play with it until it's just right. The only trouble with using a grey or black filter over green is it may make it look dirty as opposed to toning down the color. You might be better off lightening the base coat and spraying that in the middle of the panels and raised detail, then giving it a light wash."
modelmakers,39a0a8,ionizzatore,3,Wed Jun 10 11:48:48 2015 UTC,"Thanks a lot for your help, I planned to do a clear coat before I did the filter as that was the general recommendation.

modelmakers,393exo,hawkeyeking,2,Tue Jun 9 01:33:34 2015 UTC,Hmm. Might just be the light/shadow. I don't remember it being that way on the model and it's certainly not something I did on purpose. :-) I am not big on my WWII history or how these things worked buy I think the shell itself is sat in the mechanism that allows the crew to change the timer on the shell.
modelmakers,393exo,Gumderwear,2,Tue Jun 9 01:46:23 2015 UTC,"Exactly: the timer of the fuse was on the head of the shell (rotating ring), the crew would set the altitude at which the shell should explode on the gizmo and then simply put the shell in that ""slot"", the ring automatically rotate to the right position"

modelmakers,395rhn,GaiRui,4,Tue Jun 9 13:26:36 2015 UTC,It helps paint stick and can help give a uniform surface if you have a model with metal and plastic parts. It can also make it more obvious if there are seams that you need to fill or sand down.  Yep.  Thin your paint or use pre-thinned paint. Clean your airbrush every time you use it. Practice on cardboard or a sacrificial model before spraying something you want to look good. There are lots of airbrush threads on here if you want to search around-- lots of good advice has been posted over the past year or so.
modelmakers,395rhn,solipsistnation,5,Tue Jun 9 14:07:38 2015 UTC,"I want to add a few to your points:   I personally would go with black primer. Why? Well, a solid coat of black primer will get in those really hard to reach areas behind objects, and so after you give the base coat and you can't reach those areas, it's okay. It would just look like it was a shadow. Some people don't like black, and like grey and white, mainly because it's good for preshading, but I prefer black. Also, keep in mind that since you now have an airbrush, you kind of need a primer because your paint that you will be using will be very very thin. Without the primer, your thin paint probably will have trouble sticking to the surface, or could get pushed by the air.  Then for pre shading, I think painting on the panel lines is a little more difficult, especially for a novice. And if you don't have an airbrush that can do fine fine details, having really thick panel lines can be problematic. What I do, since I prime is black, is I just get the base color, then paint in the middle of the panels making sure to leave a little bit of the under primer showing near the panels.  Then, take the same base cote and lightly spray it from a distance over the model. That way, you get the same result as preshading, and in my opinion it looks way better. But I only paint 1/72, so maybe it looks kind of weird in larger scales.  And one thing that /u/solipsistnation left out was the fact that you want to paint very thin coat. Instead of getting the base coat's color instantly by spraying in one place, spray in that place, wait (or spray other locations) until the model is evenly coated in a nice thin paint. Then go over it again. Repeat this until you're model is of the desired look. But like I said before, make it so that the panel lines are still darker than the middle of the panels."
modelmakers,395rhn,alaskafish,4,Tue Jun 9 17:14:44 2015 UTC,"Primer is totally worth it, especially once you start airbrushing. Brushpainting and rattlecans will often stick pretty well without primer, but once you start airbrushing a lot of colors and paints won't stick all that well and you'll get uneven coverage and lifting paint"
modelmakers,395rhn,XenophonTheAthenian,3,Tue Jun 9 14:45:07 2015 UTC,"1) On exterior surfaces yes. With acrylic paints yes, because they have less bite than enamel or Lacquer paints and will wear or chip off easier. Interior surfaces (cockpits, etc) it's less necessary.  2) Comment on pre-shading - as a Protip, use a GLOSS color if you are pre-shading over regular plastic (i.e. no primer) or polished primer as the texture will match. If you use a flat paint over smooth plastic or polished primer, the pre-shading lines will stand out more as a difference in texture as much as color tone.  3) I'd recommend watching Paul Budzik's airbrushing videos on Youtube as he covers some important basics well. My biggest tip to give people is to never think you have to do it in one layer. I like to spray thin anyway, and often times that means that I need a couple of coats to get adequate coverage, but I have less problems with runs, orange peel, etc.."
modelmakers,395rhn,SnarkMasterRay,1 point,Tue Jun 9 14:48:40 2015 UTC,Should I put the primer on before or after shading?
modelmakers,395rhn,frugm1,3,Tue Jun 9 16:26:19 2015 UTC,"Depends on what you plan on doing. Rule of thumb.  Prime, preshade, base coat, clear coat, decal, clear coat, weather.  However for the model I'm working on at the moment I primed, bare metal finish, preshade then base coat. This way I could wear off some of the top coat to resemble worn top coat paint."

modelmakers,393y2d,thewarriorhunter,2,Wed Jun 10 03:59:42 2015 UTC,"Wingnut Wings is a small company, it's run by modellers. It's owned by Peter Jackson, who has a hand in it, but doesn't run it. It's linked to his other project 'The Vintage Aviator', which builds full size WW1 aeroplanes.  WNW only makes WW1 planes and only in 1/32. They have interesting subject matter and beautifully engineered kits, with amazing box art and decals. I suggest you take a look at the website. You can download all of the instruction manuals for each kit. I read them all the time, even without intending to build the model.  The kits give you an idea of how each plane was designed and built too, which is fascinating. Each plane has most of it's interior, as well as detailed engines, but the parts count isn't overwhelming. You can see the design reasoning behind each plane , the bulky wooden planes, as opposed to the later tube frame air frames. They have a wide selection of really interesting planes, including the big German bombers and the photo recon/light bombers. The Fokker DVII kits are just superb.  The planes inevitably have rigging, which actually isn't that hard and WNW reminds you to have fun during this process. But you can choose planes without rigging or simply leave it off.   The kits have a rare quality about them, which I've only encountered a few times. They are really fun to build, the instructions keep you interested as you make them. Everything about these kits had been thought about and done well. They also sell out of kits, which may indicate a low print run, and may relate to  the price."

It acts as a chipping medium so that when you hit it with a stiff brush, it chips away.  Primer> Base Coat> Hairspray> Whitewash> Chip your paint> Clear coat for protection  You could try to do the reverse chipping. Spray some hairspray on top of the whitewash and then add panzer gray. Then leave places you want chipping untouched while removing the places where you want to see the whitewash."

At least I won't get a link telling me to throw my bottle of green paint away. ;)  I think I am going with the one with the wolf that I linked above. The camo itself is a bit blah, but I love the slobbering wolf on the cowl. I found it at spruebrothers.   I had intended to do a NMF on this jug but Tamiya's design of a separate spine on the fuselage gave me a bit of a fit. I have rectified it enough that I will feel great about applying olive drab, but it would take me way too long to fill and sand the problem area, then re-scribing the panel lines, to do a MNF.  I have the Tamiya Razorback en-route and I hear it is the pre-eminent kit. I will reserve the MNF for that."
modelmakers,3904wb,Katamariguy,8,Mon Jun 8 07:36:33 2015 UTC,"Look pretty good to me!  Here's a couple of things you  could try.  If your hands are unsteady maybe try a larger scale kit. 1:35 or 1:48. Another thing I'd try it's maybe a slower setting glue and clamps, clothes pegs, rubberbands. Etc. Using a slower setting plastic cement would give you more time to play with it until you get it positioned correctly.  Or you could try a kit with fewer bigger parts, I recently built the revell bf109 g10. Had very few parts, but turned out to be a real nice model.  Just think about every model as a series of processes. Build, prime, base coat, weather. With a few steps in between. Plastic just like any other material can be fixed if you screw up, so many people I see on here are afraid of working with it. It's just paint and glue, if you don't like it and it down, smooth it out and try again. You'll only get better with practice!  Keep at it man. Looks great."
modelmakers,3904wb,frugm1,4,Mon Jun 8 08:00:48 2015 UTC,"A big issue is my shaky hands - I don't have very much dexterity or control of my fingertips, so the pieces have been glued together in a somewhat slipshod fashion.  I made a token attempt at weathering - drybrushing with black paint. It did improve the appearance of the model, but not by as much as I'd like."
modelmakers,3904wb,RapeApe,1 point,Mon Jun 8 07:38:07 2015 UTC,"I have shaky hands too...one reason I haven't even attempted anything smaller than 1:35.  I've been getting better at control though.  One trick is to get real close (I use an Optivisor magnifier, so that helps)  and pinch your elbows intot your body (T-Rex style).  If your hands are still shaky, try stabilizing your hands against something.    For example, when I'm brush painting small details on a figure, I'll hold it in one hand and fold both arms up against my chest with my palms together...sort of prayer style...so that the model is right in front of my face.  Sometimes, I'll lean my whole body into my workbench as well.    When done right, everything is very stable, and about the only thing moving is my thumb and forefinger of the hand holding the brush.  You can use a similar technique for gluing very small parts together as well.  Oh, and if you don't have one, I HIGHLY recommend you get an Optivisor or something similar.  Depending on the focal length, you need to be around 6-8"" away from what you're looking at, so stabilizing your hands right in front of your face works well."

modelmakers,3904wb,LemonGear,2,Wed Jun 10 19:06:37 2015 UTC,"It looks like you painted parts of it but left the body unpainted, I'm assuming based on the looks of the sprue marks. If you don't want it to look too plastic-y, get some matte coat in a spray can and give the model a light coat (IMPORTANT - mask the clear parts if you do this). That's what a lot of gundam builders do when they just do a straight out of the box build (not advisable for most scale models).  If your manual dexterity is an issue, try building larger 1/48-1/35 scale kits like /u/frugm1 recommended. I almost entirely build 1/72 scale armor and I don't think I would still be doing it if I didn't have the dexterity for it, certain kits can be more frustrating than others in this respect (even after I eventually bought tweezers)."

modelmakers,3904wb,Anonieme_Angsthaas,2,Mon Jun 8 08:56:12 2015 UTC,"Are you putting down a layer of surface primer before paint?   Painting directly onto plastic will not end well.   Choose what kind of paint you use. Acrylics vs enamels vs lacquers...  Choose what finish the paint has. Glassy, satin, matte.   If you are brush painting thin your paint out. A lot. Thin it more than you think necessary and build the color up in several very thin coats. It will look like hot garbage for the first few coats until the color starts to build enough to get consistent.   I use Tamiya spraycans because I haven't had happy experiences with airbrushes, and paintbrushes is mind numbing. I prime with Tamiya surface primer, wait half an hour. Then I suspend my parts from a metal clotheshanger and hit with my color of choice. Tamiya has an awesome selection of armor and aircraft color choices.  The spray cans take some getting used to, so I'd recommend practicing on a kit you don't care much about. But I have been doing it long enough to get consistent layers. Quick and easy."

Because mine were circular, it was pretty easy with a Dremel sanding wheel, but you'll probably have to use a hand file since you're cutting away rectangular panels."

As of right now my only plans are to drill out the front firewall and add some wiring harness looking pieces to the back of the instrument panel.  This is only my 3rd model after about a 15 year hiatus and I am in a sort of phase of wanting to build things that look new. I imagine that as I progress, I will start weathering things a bit more. That being said, in my time off from modelling, it seems that weathering has become the new normal. So much of it is taken to an extreme that I don't really dig. Having been a firefighter and having grown up in and around the military, it seems counter-intuitive to me to see equipment that is as ratted out as new weathering techniques make things look. Looking at historical documents (Corsairs being a counter example of planes that end up looking trashed due to the conditions in the Asiatic theater) many of the well used planes were still well kept, or maybe that is my own confirmation bias at work.  Or maybe, I am just getting my feet underneath me, learning how to use an airbrush, and I am trying to convince myself that I don't want to weather things because I'm not confident that I have gotten re-acquainted with my basic skills yet.  Who knows?  Regardless, thanks for the compliments!  Album of the build will be kept updated here: http://imgur.com/a/YwE62#10"

modelmakers,38y0y6,alaskafish,1 point,Sun Jun 7 22:45:15 2015 UTC,Don't go to eBay. People think they can nickle and dime you for some crappy models. Some one was selling six 1/72 'professionally' made models for $120. Buying the kits unbuilt would have cost $60.   He had the nerve to charge 100% more.
modelmakers,38y0y6,Nemephis,1 point,Mon Jun 8 04:32:11 2015 UTC,"So 60 dollar for sanding parts, paiting parts, making the model, putting decals on × 6... that sounds like a very fair deal."

There were gaps, no sanding, foggy canopies, missing parts, painted using wrong colors, and poorly applied paint.  I'm all for selling models, but if you sell it never above what the base price of the model costs. Making a model doesn't increase the price because you're paying more for the experience and enjoyment of building/painting a model rather than the end product."

modelmakers,38y0y6,alaskafish,0,Mon Jun 8 13:07:59 2015 UTC,"I'm saying most people buy models for the fun/experience. Only a select few really well done models can be sold for anything profitable.   Charging 100% more than the original price of the kit, then half assing it doesn't mean you can charge more. It's one of those markets where just because you applied work onto the model, doesn't mean it's more money. Take for instance, Artwork. If you paint the Mona Lisa, well; it's gonna get you some money. But not everyone can do it. However, most people will paint the Godzilla shooting lines out if it's eyes that you post on your refrigerator... that's not worth more than it cost you to make... unless you want it for sentimental value."

modelmakers,38y0y6,jalien,1 point,Tue Jun 9 05:07:14 2015 UTC,"Isn't that like saying that you should never buy a painting for more than the price of the canvas and the paints?  It totally depends on the skill level of the builder/artist to how much you can charge for a built model.  For us modellers we buy the kits to build. For me, as someone on here once nicely put it, the best part it the serenity of the build. It's the peace I get from the concentration of building and painting something. Would I consider selling my builds, absolutely not.  If you're not a modellers though and your looking to buy a finished product then I would expect to pay more than base price, you're paying for materials and the builders time and experience. By your argument the guy that scratch builds F1 race cars shouldn't charge much more than $10-$50 dollars as his stuff is made of card and plastic sheeting? I expect he is charging orders of magnitude more than that as he is an artist."
modelmakers,38y0y6,alaskafish,0,Tue Jun 9 01:34:20 2015 UTC,"as someone on here once nicely put it, the best part it the serenity of the build    I said that. That' the thing. The market for models is more for the enjoyment factor rather than the profit. Same with artwork. Most artists make art as a hobby rather than a income source. But only  select few can actually sell it for profit.    By your argument the guy that scratch builds F1 race cars shouldn't charge much more than $10-$50 dollars as his stuff is made of card and plastic sheeting?   See that's where the issue with my own statement comes. Yes, the guy who makes those should charge a lot. Because a lot more effort goes into making those models. However, buying a $15 model kit, building it within a day, then asking for upwards of $100 for that single kit is outrageous. And that was my original point. A lot of people on eBay don't understand that just because the model was finished (regardless of effort, original price, ect), it means it will be sold for more.   Let's go back to Art. A painter on his canvas needs to understand their skill level. Most people probably can't paint a Mona Lisa. And the issue with art is that there's a effort factor in the pricing, that's a given and I won't doubt it. You do have to pay for people's effort. My issue is putting in lackluster effort, then expect it to be worth a Mona Lisa. And my point was that eBay is full of pre-made models like that out there. From people who think that just because it was built, it means it's more than what it was originally."
modelmakers,38y0y6,jalien,1 point,Tue Jun 9 05:08:32 2015 UTC,"So I think we are agreeing on the same point then! :-) There is definitely a level of skill at play here. I know I wouldn't sell my models just like I wouldn't try and sell a painting but the true artists among us should sell and should charge a lot (I.e. F1 guy - omfg those were gorgeous).   I do take your point that eBay is full of crap but then again it's eBay, what do you expect. Lots of crap and some occasional good deals!   I'm glad that we agree!

modelmakers,38xjzx,Plundersquirrel,3,Sun Jun 7 19:25:25 2015 UTC,"I found acrylic paint quite thick so I think thinning paint down and brushing it on gently might work for you. I however have little experience with this (I've painted goopy too much) but conceptually it sounded like a good idea when I've read about it.   I have no knowledge about priming but I've seen people use fine automotive grey primer to do this.   For German WW2 AFV paintschemes, I think a overall color of a color for the theater (so for example, sand, snow or grey) and then mottling on color pr some colours, similar to the box, or perhaps a 'summer theater' scheme with stripes instead of mottling could be easy to do.  If you painted it one flat color it would be kind of boring (but typical), but trying fine brush work on the tracks, gun, hull front, engine deck+exhaust, hatches might make it look interesting but not needing to paint camouflage. The spaced armour panels could be easy to make look interesting as it's just thin metal so a lot of possible ideas can be used for them."
modelmakers,38xjzx,LemonGear,2,Sun Jun 7 19:20:18 2015 UTC,"I like these ideas, thank you!"
modelmakers,38xjzx,Plundersquirrel,2,Sun Jun 7 19:26:05 2015 UTC,"Thanks. I went and took two pictures as you took the time to reply - well, I have only touched ships (lately 3 1/700 ones: this is a Pit-road 1/700 Shiratsuyu - I really do make models, I feel accountable now!.. I just don't post here much.) so I can get away with many things that would be a bit obvious because it's all tiny.  Hopefully a few more people pop by the thread as the day goes by, and they might have corrections for what I said and more ideas, especially ones applicable to the larger scale (for me anyway) AFVs.  I always fear of painting such that you could peel the paint off and make an entire new kit from the crusty horribleness. What I mean about thick paint, it's kinda useless out of the tins or jars they come in: Forgive the fluff, it's about 5 years old and from a shelf, but if I painted the grey blobs any thicker it'd end up as an anti-torpedo bulge! Revell 1/720 - Blucher - German ww2 Heavy Cruiser.  Another thing I learned about was remembering to wash the plastic so the invisible gunk goo sticky mess stuff whatsitcalled comes off the surface. Something about a coating for the mold to be able to eject the plastic when it's done doesn't like paint. I haven't touched too many brands so I don't really know the 'feel', but soap and warm water didn't hurt too many souls. I remember some kits feeling super slimy...  One other thing, the first time I used clear coat spray I sprayed it on so thickly I could move the model around and watch the liquid from the spray float around. Infact so thick it made the back of my throat sore and metalic tasting because I didn't wear PPE. The second try I did I clear coated Sharpie onto a piece of metal and the ink didn't run and it doesn't rub off, but I wonder how fine would be needed to not melt decals, that's a question for someone else."
modelmakers,38xjzx,Plundersquirrel,2,Sun Jun 7 20:02:47 2015 UTC,"That's a good point about cleaning the parts before assembly. I used to do a lot of war gaming miniatures and was always amazed at all the gross grey gunk that came off with a wash. And yes, watering down the paint and applying multiple coats if needed sure sounds better than going down the route of paint blobs! Thanks for all details.

modelmakers,38xl4a,35thArmorGuy,6,Sun Jun 7 18:28:37 2015 UTC,"I've seen that from a friend who used similar products. Make sure you are using a stirring stick and scraping the bottom to ensure the pigment is mixed in well. He eventually gave up as he kept getting mixed results and went with oil paints.   Hobby lobby or art store.. purchase 5 tubes of oil paint. Actual oil, not the acrylic oil paints they've started putting out there. Get some odorless mineral spirits in a large container, never buy premixed washes again. You want tubes in the $4-9 range if you're in the US. These tend to be good quality without being really large pigments with a ton of oil. Holbein,  Old Holland, and Windsor-Newton are the brands I use and have several options to choose from from each brand. These are all in the $7+ price range though and are really overkill for what I'm using them for, but a single tube will last forever.   Colors you may want to pick up: Lamp black, Burnt umber, platnum white, Navy or a very dark blue, Something along a medium gray.  While you're at it, you can pick up some pastel sticks in earth tones, a good set of 10 will run you around $8 at my local store. Sand the sticks with an old bit of sandpaper and boom, you have the ability to make any color rust and dirt powders you could need."
modelmakers,38xl4a,HandBanaba,3,Sun Jun 7 18:58:27 2015 UTC,"Oils do make the best washes.  They don't dry quickly so there is time to ""work"" it if you need to."
modelmakers,38xl4a,HughJorgens,2,Mon Jun 8 01:37:31 2015 UTC,Excellent answer. Looks like I've got some shopping to do.
modelmakers,38xl4a,solipsistnation,1 point,Sun Jun 7 19:33:33 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's exactly what I'd suggest right there. Oils are very forgiving and easy to work with (since if you don't like it you can just wipe it off with some turpenoid). And you can make them about as subtle or obvious as you prefer.   I'd suggest a tube of caucasian flesh tone oil paints, too-- it works pretty well for light dust on dark surfaces.  Just be really careful about the clearcoat you use before applying oils and turpenoid. Turpenoid is a pretty hot solvent and will eat your clearcoat (or paints) if you're not careful. I seal everything with Future before using oils, but any acrylic clearcoat should be good. If you're not sure, test it on a spare piece of plastic."
modelmakers,38xl4a,HughJorgens,2,Mon Jun 8 03:36:55 2015 UTC,"Hmm, hard to say, the wash is enamel so it shouldn't react with the vallejo paints.  Is it humid where you are?  Could the gloss varnish be uncured? These are things that could cause something to whiten up.  I have never heard of that wash so I don't know what the quality is. I would just make my own wash, or try the one you have on some other paints just to see what happens.  Washes aren't hard, just thinner and a little paint."
modelmakers,38xl4a,HughJorgens,1 point,Sun Jun 7 18:55:39 2015 UTC,"Not humid here (yet). I was wondering if it had something to do with the gloss coat, so I tried it on just the base color which had been done for a couple days. Same result."
modelmakers,38xl4a,HughJorgens,2,Sun Jun 7 19:12:05 2015 UTC,"It's probably the wash, I would just make my own.  You might try to get in touch with them and see if you got a bad batch, but it probably isn't worth it."
modelmakers,38xl4a,frugm1,1 point,Sun Jun 7 19:15:40 2015 UTC,"It was probably 5$ or so, not worth it to me. Looks like I'm gonna make my own."
modelmakers,38xl4a,ionizzatore,2,Sun Jun 7 19:35:10 2015 UTC,"Go with an oil wash like Handbanaba said, they work the best."
modelmakers,38yfez,ThePath76,4,Sun Jun 7 22:21:05 2015 UTC,"What I've started doing is the 1st coat is done with a soft round brush. Good for getting into cracks and covering small parts. I might do a 2nd coat the same way depending on how well the first covered. My last coat I use a stiff bristled flat brush painting in long strokes trying to keep all the strokes in the same direction.   I can still see brush strokes on my model depending on the angle, but they aren't terribly noticeable (though my standards may be low).  I also use Vallejo, and I haven't had to thin any of my base colors for painting (4B0 green primer, and US Army green).  I do thin for the varnishes now though."
modelmakers,38yfez,35thArmorGuy,2,Sun Jun 7 23:46:29 2015 UTC,I guess I'm not very familiar with what's considered noticeably streaky. I just think it's too much but we're always our own worst critic. I'll keep working at it
modelmakers,38yfez,Kronos6948,3,Mon Jun 8 00:05:42 2015 UTC,"I'm like you. I can't afford a decent airbrush, so I paint everything by hand.   Base coats, if they're a uniform color, I'll use a rattle can. I'll spray primer on with a rattle can, then do the main color with a rattle can. The rest I do with brushes.   That being said, make sure to invest in some decent brushes. Crap brushes will leave more of a brush stroke. Be sure that your paint is thinned, and that you're using quality paints. I use acrylics, and I thin them with water. I drop some on my palette, then add a small drop of water. If it's not enough, I'll drop a little more. If need be, I'll test it on a scrap surface to see how it flows off the brush. The color should still be solid but should flow really well while sticking. The thinning will reduce or eliminate brush strokes."
modelmakers,38yfez,Kronos6948,2,Mon Jun 8 00:02:10 2015 UTC,"I think I need to invest in brushes that don't cost under five dollars, and look into using a can for my bases instead of trying to brush them on."
modelmakers,38yfez,Kronos6948,3,Mon Jun 8 00:07:47 2015 UTC,That's the route I went. And bigger brushes if you do have to use a brush to paint on the base coat.
modelmakers,38yfez,Kronos6948,2,Mon Jun 8 00:09:53 2015 UTC,Does Vallejo offer rattle cans? I know only of Tamiya's cans
modelmakers,38yfez,Kronos6948,1 point,Mon Jun 8 00:31:57 2015 UTC,"I don't think so. Tamiya's cans are a bit finicky. But there's a huge selection of rattle cans at any hardware store, depending on what color you're looking for. What kind of models do you primarily build?"
modelmakers,38yfez,RapeApe,2,Mon Jun 8 00:46:39 2015 UTC,"I just got back into this, I'm doing Tamiya's T62-A. Can I use just regular old spray paint?"
modelmakers,38yfez,loulaki,3,Mon Jun 8 00:56:14 2015 UTC,"Yes, but be sure to prime first. Wash the model in warm soapy water to remove any mold release agent off of it. Then use a rattle can primer. Try not to use heavy coats, or you risk losing small details. One to two coats of primer, one to two coats of paint, and your base color should be fine. Make sure to paint them as sub assemblies, not the whole thing. You won't get paint everywhere you'd like to if you don't at least paint sub assemblies. Some stuff, I paint right on the sprue. When cutting from the sprue, you can decant (spray some spray paint into a small container-BE CAREFUL OF FUMES AND BLOWBACK-USE A LID WITH A HOLE TO DECANT) and use brushes to touch up the ends that were connected to the sprue. Or, if those are ends to be glued, then you don't need to worry about painting. Or, if you have matching vallejo paint, you can use that to touch up.   If you do decant the paint, no need to buy brush cleaner or paint thinner to clean the brushes. 91% rubbing alcohol will clean them just fine, and cost a hell of a lot less, without worrying about ruining the glue holding the hairs in the brush. Also good for removing overspray if you get paint on parts you don't want to have paint on, without ruining the plastic."
modelmakers,38yfez,ionizzatore,2,Mon Jun 8 01:06:24 2015 UTC,"That's good to know. I don't really know why but I just assumed spray paint... wouldn't work. Acrylics will adhere well to the spray paint base then, yes?"
modelmakers,38yfez,ionizzatore,2,Mon Jun 8 01:13:41 2015 UTC,"Once you allow them to dry fully, there should be no issue. I've done all my models this way. Just as an FYI, I don't use gloss base coats. If I want a gloss finish after I'm done, I use a gloss clear coat."
modelmakers,38yfez,BOB_9000,2,Mon Jun 8 01:17:31 2015 UTC,"Definitely, I painted my car the same way. I worried less about doing that than I have about this model haha. Thanks for the info, I'm gonna pick up some cans and get this ball rolling."
modelmakers,38yfez,BOB_9000,1 point,Mon Jun 8 01:24:15 2015 UTC,"Not necessarily.  A while back I found a bunch of youtube videos on painting miniature figures that really helped my brush painting.  One of them went into the details of how to use a brush properly and what exactly makes a good brush and why you want one.    I can't remember the exact videos but let me see if I can relay the gist of it.  You don't necessarily always want the tiniest brush possible (size 00, 5/0, 10/0, etc) for the smallest detail work.  You can get very fine detail with a size 0 brush if it's well-made.  A good brush is hand-made and all of the hairs are oriented so they curve inward and form a sort of teardrop shape precise tip.  The tip is the only part of the brush you want you want to use in your brush strokes.  The fat part (the belly) should hold a reservoir of paint that flows into the tip...kinda like a fountain pen.  Different types of hair used in the brush will have different characteristics regarding how well they hold paint in the belly and how well they retain a good tip.  I don't really know the details of most of the different types of brush hairs, but the consensus seems to be that Kolinsky Sable is the shit you want.  Specifically, the Windsor & Newton Series 7 seems to be the gold standard.  Maybe I'll buy one someday :)  Anyways, I heard somewhere that Rosemary & Co's Series 33 are similar in style and quality to the W&N Series 7, but way cheaper, so I ordered some, and I'm so glad I did.  The quality of my brush painting has improved dramatically and I now get a lot of compliments on the detail of my figures (still have trouble with eyes at 1/35 tho...the brushes aren't magic).  Mainly I use a size 0 brush.  I also have a size 1 and a 4 that I use for larger areas and base coats.  For faces I like the 3/0, which is my smallest brush...it's still got a decent size belly.  You should check out youtube videos to find specific painting techniques and tips on how much to thin your paint, etc... but you'll find they work a lot better if you have a good brush :)"
modelmakers,38w10v,yawningangel,5,Sun Jun 7 08:29:53 2015 UTC,"I'd recommend doing a coat of hairspray over the base coat rather than a lacquer coat; this will stop the bottom coat chipping off. Just rub with a wet brush, and the top coats should come off. I think you need a fairly stiff brush too though.  I've haven't tried it yet myself, so if someone can correct me on any mistakes I made, please do.  As for the gun, it depends on how big you want the chips to be. If you want them to be quite small, use pencil. If you want the them to be bigger, use the metallic undercoat, then hairspray, top coat, wet stuff brush.  Afraid I can't help on the last one. Do none come with the kit?"
modelmakers,38w10v,Plundersquirrel,1 point,Sun Jun 7 08:48:46 2015 UTC,"Totally forgot about hairspray.. Do you decant and airbrush ,or just from the can?"
modelmakers,38w10v,frugm1,3,Sun Jun 7 10:41:08 2015 UTC,"I don't ordinarily clear coat the base before hair spray, but I guess you could. As long as you don't go to crazy with removing the top coat you should be fine.  Personally I decant and airbrush the hair spray just allows me to control it better. Although airbrushing you'll probably want a couple of coats being as it's allot thinner. I'll use a tooth pick to remove the top coat once applied.  As for the controls, just dry brushing with metal would be fine. You could hair spray chip if you wanted a really worn effect.  Figures, lots of company's make the ones you're looking for. Check eBay. Dragon, tamiya and verlinden spring  to mind."
modelmakers,38w10v,Plundersquirrel,3,Sun Jun 7 11:44:14 2015 UTC,Some great advice there..really appreciated..  Think il decant the spray and go for the same effect for the controls..

When you do decide to chip use the designated solvent for whatever paint you use, I usually paint with acrylics so I just use water."

modelmakers,38uccp,BorisIvanovich,3,Sun Jun 7 02:13:36 2015 UTC,"Thanks friend. I found a few Mig Jimenez videos on YouTube that explained the technique. Basically using a fine brush i used paint the consistency of cream. First i added white to the base colour and drew random patches of colour. Mig says to pretend like I'm drawing pictures of the countries you would see on a map, then using a mix of black and gunmetal i drew inside these shapes leaving a border of the lighter colour. Its really super simple. I went a bit ott i Think!"
modelmakers,38uccp,kensboro,3,Sun Jun 7 05:26:44 2015 UTC,So you didn't use chipping fluid/hairspray???
modelmakers,38uccp,Gewehr43,2,Sun Jun 7 09:41:29 2015 UTC,Not a single bit. I use hairspray chipping occasionally but i prefer hand painting. It's easy for me to get really carried away with the hairspray technique. I usually end up stripping the whole thing back

If you don't, the oil dot technique is pretty cool. You basically paint on spots and small dabs of oil paint in appropriate shades, then use a soft cloth just barely dampened with turps or thinner to blend and remove most of the paint.  Pin washes, subtle drybrushing, and pastel shading also help.  Start with the plane painted and decalled in a clean state, with the decals sealed under clear coats or Future.

After some extensive Google searching and coming up with nothing, I decided to consult the hive mind of reddit to see if anyone might have any details about this particular model.  The plane itself is made of wood. A chip taken off of one of the wingtips revealed pressboard. The rest of the model is consistent with desk models displayed in military offices and the like. Does anyone know any information about this particular model?"

Polar Lights and Monogram have re-issued this kit, so you can probably still find it, but it's a fairly close match to the one you've pictured (even comes on a stand) if you want to get another.  http://www.collecttoys.net/Models-Kits/Aurora/batplane.php  http://qtan.homestead.com/batplane.html  just do a google search for it.

I think you'll really benefit from learning to use washes, too-- you've got some good detail on the figures, but it all looks a little flat. Washes (and drybrushing!) will help the details pop out a bit. You may also find it easier if you thin your paint a little before brushing it on, especially flesh tones where brush marks or a little roughness really stand out.

For the measures take a real brick, measure it and divide the measure by the scale (if your model is in 1/35 and you brick is 30cm long, 30/35= 0.857cm, your scale brick needs to be long 8mm).  Remember that destroyed walls will have debris around them, try to create them with insulation foam, cork, cat bedding (paint and dry brush them with gray tones to simulate stone and concrete, brown and reddish brown to simulate broken bricks). Wood was widely used in wwii era  European houses, use broken ice cream sticks (or wooden strips, as long as they ""look right"") to simulate collapsed beams (paint them with heavily thinned brown paint to change the tone a little bit)"

modelmakers,38odli,surprised_platypus,1 point,Fri Jun 5 15:02:33 2015 UTC,"Hi /r/modelmakers ! I recently discovered this hobby and put together a shopping list according to the 'Modeler's Toolbox' link in the sidebar. I decided to paint with acrylics and do washes & weathering with other paints. I understand you need non-water soluble paint to do washes etc. on the gloss coat.  Now my question: Do I have to buy premade washes or can I make my own? If so, what paint and colors should I buy? Or do you need pigments? (any brands that are recommended?) Will terpentine work as a thinner?"
modelmakers,38odli,XenophonTheAthenian,2,Fri Jun 5 16:58:42 2015 UTC,"You don't actually need a non-water soluble wash if you're going to use a protective gloss coat (as you should). So long as the medium for your wash won't damage the gloss coat (which is one reason why Future rocks, cuz it'll survive a nuclear blast) you can put pretty much anything you want on there. Enamel and oil washes are preferred because just in case you didn't coat it quite as well as you wanted the acrylic underneath is still safe, and also because they have a much longer drying time, allowing you to play around with them a bit more to get the effect right and blend properly--even the best water-based washes (in my opinion the Florymodels ones) are pretty finicky about being cleaned up and don't always blend well. You get different effects using water-based and enamel or oil-based washes.   Anyway, you don't need to buy premade washes, a tiny little dollop of pigment with a gigantic amount of thinner will create a wash just fine. The advantage of premade washes is that it saves you the trouble of having to fuss around with colors and stuff to get the color wash you want--many of the washes that Ak Interactive (or Mig or whatever they're calling themselves these days) and others are specially formulated to give particular effects on particular paint schemes. Fussing around with colors until I get that specific is not something I'm interested in doing. But some basic color washes are pretty easy and definitely money-saving--black, brown, rust. I'd actually go and pick up a few tubes of oils to make your basic washes with--they'll last you forever and oil washes are really easy to work with"
modelmakers,38odli,surprised_platypus,1 point,Fri Jun 5 17:22:04 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the advice! Just saw that there's an elaborate guide to washes in the FAQ, sorry about that. Alright I'll definitely go with the oil tubes then. Will turpentine work as a solvent for these? Also as a side question: Do I have the order right? Paint - decals - gloss - weathering & washes"
modelmakers,38odli,XenophonTheAthenian,2,Fri Jun 5 18:21:36 2015 UTC,"You want to put a gloss coat on before decals, and then one after. Decals don't go onto rough (i.e. matte) surfaces well, and you want to put a protective layer of gloss on after applying decals but before weathering to seal and protect them. Some guys spot-apply Future where the decals will go, then spray Future on top--I've never been able to brush Future on worth a damn, so I just spray two coats. You'll also of course want to hit it with a dull coat after--some weathering techniques, like filters, dry brushing, and pigments work best on matte.   Turpentine is probably too harsh, although there's a lot of different kinds of natural and synthetic turpentine and turpenoids and whatnot. I use Mona Lisa white spirit--it's not harsh at all and it works just fine (and doesn't smell nasty)"
modelmakers,38odli,surprised_platypus,1 point,Fri Jun 5 18:58:28 2015 UTC,Alright got it :) thanks a bunch!  Will make a post one I've completed my shopping list or one I've got everything.  Thanks for the help!
modelmakers,38odli,solipsistnation,2,Fri Jun 5 19:40:05 2015 UTC,"You can make your own washes-- use a ratio of something like 10 or more solvent to 1 paint. (For acrylic you can use water or the appropriate thinner for the type of paint you're using.) You can use water-based paint over a gloss coat if you want-- you just need to make sure everything is dry before applying it, same as anything else where you're putting paint over paint.   I like Vallejo's washes-- I do cut them about 50/50 with water anyway, though.   For pigments, you don't need fancy model pigments-- I've been using a box of chalk pastels I picked up for about 10 bucks at an art supply store. I scrape off chalk dust and use that as a pigment. I pick it up with a brush wet with turpenoid and squoosh it onto the model and then sort of brush it off once the turpenoid has dried so it stays stuck in panel lines and stuff.   I wouldn't use real turpentine since it's super stinky. Art store turpenoid will work and won't give you a headache from the stench.   Be careful about the gloss coat you're using, too-- if you're using turpenoid or another solvent-based paint over it, they tends to be really hot and may eat some of it. If you can find an acrylic gloss coat use that. Future, AKA ""Pledge Floor Care Multi-Surface Finish"" is sort of magical, and it's pretty easy to see why model builders use it. (Plus it costs like 10 bucks for enough to cover dozens of models and it has an almost pleasant fake apple scent.) Once it's sprayed on and dries there's not much that'll eat it, so you can protect your nice base coat from turpentine and other paints and stuff while you apply washes and pigments and oil paints or whatever."
modelmakers,38odli,surprised_platypus,1 point,Fri Jun 5 17:26:08 2015 UTC,Thanks for the reply! OK is the turpentine only a solvent for the pigments then? Or can it be used for oil paints? I'll buy some calk pastels like you said :)  Yeah I live in switzerland and don't have access to Future floor wax :/ There is a retailer that sells it in Germany but it costs like 30 euros for 300 ml and shipping costs about as much. I'll be using the gloss by tamiya instead (would that be an equally good protectant?)
modelmakers,38odli,solipsistnation,1 point,Fri Jun 5 18:10:28 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure about Tamiya's-- if it's acrylic, it should be fine.  I use turpentine for both pigments and oil paints, yes.   To answer the question from your other reply, you're close-- paint->glosscoat->decals->glosscoat->washes/weathering and probably a protective clear coat over that (probably a matte finish).  Decals pretty much only work well on a glossy surface. I usually just paint on a little gloss on spots where decals will go, put on the decals, and then glosscoat over the whole thing.   If you go through my Panzer II posts here:  http://www.reddit.com/r/modelmakers/wiki/buildalongs  ...you'll see the order I usually do stuff in. Washes will be in the next update, which I need to get around to writing up and posting."

It's not as harsh as white spirit/mineral spirit (called testbenzin in german IIRC) since it's processed even further to remove the toxic and smelly things in it.   Future on our side of the world is called ""Pledge"", and is nowadays a milky solution instead of clear. It works just as well (even though some still swear that the clear one is better). Check out http://www.swannysmodels.com/TheCompleteFuture.html for further reference. Almost any laquer or water-based clear coat will work since they idea is that it doesn't react* to the solvent in enamel or oil paint washes. Tamiya Clear will work. :)     *Your mileage may vary"

modelmakers,38odli,solipsistnation,1 point,Fri Jun 5 18:57:54 2015 UTC,"What are you using for a gloss coat? Are you spraying it or brushpainting? (I'm going to assume airbrushing...)  If it's Future or something like that, it actually works better to lay it on pretty thick. It's self-levelling, so as long as you don't hit it with so much it forms puddles it'll get pretty smooth on its own. This is pretty much the opposite of most clearcoats, where you need to lay down several very thin coats, giving them some time to dry between each one...  It's probably worth trying out on a practice model or on some scrap plastic."
modelmakers,38odli,MrCinical,1 point,Fri Jun 5 20:43:04 2015 UTC,"Was more referring to gloss black paint over primer, prior to alcad stuff, though future hasn't worked well for me either so I will definitely try that!"
modelmakers,38odli,pxpxpx,1 point,Fri Jun 5 20:55:44 2015 UTC,"The ""thing"" with gloss paint is to know when it starts to run, and just put on enough for it to not run (sounds easier than it is). Usually when you get the rough looking texture it's because the paint is drying before it has time to level out, a retarder medium and sometimes more paint usually does it."
modelmakers,38odli,Gewehr43,1 point,Sat Jun 6 00:03:05 2015 UTC,"My method for future is to spray on a thin coat, wait 15 minutes, then spray another.  Then repeat.  So, over the course of a half an hour I lay down 3 light coats.  That seems to give me a really nice, smooth, glossy shell.  Not sure if that will work for alclad stuff.  Never used it before."

Mostly it depends on the kinds of tracks I'm building-- rubber pads, all metal, modern, WW2-era, or what.  These tracks:  http://i.imgur.com/dWup65R.jpg  ...are a combination of techniques. They're Friulmodel metal tracks. I started by spraying them with Tamiya primer, and then sprayed them with Vallejo Dark Rust and Light Rust washes, which honestly kind of sucked and I wouldn't do that again. (It smelled terrible, too.) When that dried, I ground up a mix of chalk pastels-- dark brown, earthy red, a little black, a little off-white and pale yellow. I then applied those with a paintbrush dipped in turpenoid and worked them into the tracks pretty thoroughly and let it dry for a while. When they were dry, I took a stuff brush and whisked it back and forth across the tracks to knock off any chalk from the raised parts of the tracks (mostly leaving the chalk that had gotten ground into the tracks). When I thought that looked okay, I took a fingernail sanding block (my favorite plastic sanding tool) and ran it lightly over the tracks to sand off the paint and stuff to bare metal on the raised parts of the track. I think it came out pretty well:  http://i.imgur.com/mTAMgKg.jpg"

modelmakers,38mirq,pxpxpx,4,Fri Jun 5 07:23:43 2015 UTC,"Fair enough. Acrylics should not be dangerous per se, with the usual point that inhaling any paint particles probably isn't good anyways. I did quick google search and here's little article from one forum to ease your mind a bit:  If anyone is interested, I've dowloaded several Material Safety Data Sheets on Tamiya paints and thinners, and can provide a list of ingredients if needed or wanted.  Most of the chemicals are run of the mill alcohols and some glycol ethers (used as surfactants).  Pigment consists of titanium dioxide and carbon black.  No heavy metals were noted.  Used correctly and in small quantities (ie, airbrushing), these materials should not cause any problems, as Hawkeye has already pointed out.  Source - What is toxic in Tamiya paints"

Repeated exposure in large doses (as in huffing the stuff) is of course bad. But over a normal session there isn't much to worry about. It smells bad, but as long as it isn't aerosolised it's pretty safe.  You could get limonene cement if the smell from the regular cement bothers your kid. Otherwise I wouldn't be too worried unless he starts airbrushing his kits. Chances are that he comes in contact with much more toxic stuff in daily life.  Teach him good habits like ventilation when around solvents, cleaning hands after modelling and to cut away from the body when using knives and he'll be as safe as he can be. :)"

I built it as big as the space would allow. I thought it would swallow up all my paint, and leave me tons of empty space for the future. I have more stuff than I thought! It will be nice to have the paint in the heated house, ready 24/7. I'm going to put a compressor in the basement and have the hose run through a hole in the floor. I'm still thinking through the paint booth."

modelmakers,38hy9p,Destructias_Warlord,1 point,Thu Jun 4 09:56:49 2015 UTC,"Should I put the decals on now or later?   As /u/Destructias_Warlord said, put the decals on before any weathering attempt then seal everything with a layer (or two) of clear coat.   What is the best solution for rust effects? I'm currently considering putting patches of rust colour where they logically would be, spraying the model in hairspray, doing another coat of green and finally scraping the paint off where the rust is. When should I add the rust effects, before or after white camo?   I'm afraid that it's too late for the hairspray technique (you already painted the hull with the ""real"" color). The alternative is to do the chipping with a fine brush or with a sponge (you should be able to find plenty of tutorials, but feel free to ask if you have any question)   Best way to get real chunky textured mud effects on the tracks and lower part of the tank?   My mud always look flat, i have nothing to suggest here :X   Finally what is the best way to add the white snow camo over the whole tank?   IMHO: Hairspray technique. Add the decals, clear coat, let the coat dry completely, spray the thairspray, paint the white (avoiding to cover the markings), start to scrub the surface with a brush damped in water where you want to remove the paint. (this is the post when i first tried this technique)   On a another point, there are two cable like things on the model at the front that I have made from gluing several strands of cotton together (pictured here: http://imgur.com/4VDJT4z ), however they are not held firmly together yet, how can I achieve this?   "" not held firmly together "", what do you mean? the ""cap"" detaches easily?"
modelmakers,38hy9p,ionizzatore,2,Thu Jun 4 12:52:06 2015 UTC,"For mud, try pastel chalk. When you scrape it, it makes different sized pigment granules. Add this to water and white glue.

modelmakers,38hy9p,BOB_9000,1 point,Sat Jun 6 22:39:20 2015 UTC,"""Should I put the decals on now or later?"" Well, depends. It's true that you put them on before weathering, but it depends on whether you want the tank to have markings painted before the winter camo, or after. If you go with the before, put them one now, and do your camo on top. There'll be a slight hint of them there if all goes well. If not, do your camo, add decals, and THEN weather."
modelmakers,38hy9p,BOB_9000,1 point,Thu Jun 4 20:15:42 2015 UTC,"About the rust -- for streaks, I apply small amounts of oil, and streak it down with a brush dipped in mineral spirits. I also give my models a coat of rust wash too. I find dabbing a sponge in a SMALL amount of really dark brown (almost black), and then dabbing the tank where I want chipping compliments this really well. Apply chips, then do streaks for some of the larger chips. I've also seen people apply dry pigment for that coarse rusty look. There's other ways out there too, but I'm not familiar with them. As for when to add them, again, depends. If you want your tank to have been used before the winter camo, before. If you want your tank to have been used after, after. I would recommend both before and after, to give it a bit of history."
modelmakers,38hy9p,BOB_9000,1 point,Thu Jun 4 20:19:55 2015 UTC,"The mud -- There's plenty of ways. Some people coat the areas where they want mud with a solution of white glue and mineral spirits/water, and then sprinkle on pigment or dry tile grout. Others (I've tried this one myself, not impressed, but that's because I overdid the soda, it can look good if done right) mix brown paint with baking soda. But that's the cheap way for people who don't like to pay for stuff (me). A similar mixture can be maid with pigment and water, I assume. But to get the look you're describing, of that really wet muddy stuff, you should probably buy premade mud, which looks fantastic, from someone like mig."
modelmakers,38hy9p,BOB_9000,1 point,Thu Jun 4 20:24:28 2015 UTC,"As fir the snow and cable -- Well cables made of string have never failed to look horrid and disappoint in every way imaginable, in my experience. I tend to leave them out. Wire cables are a different story. As for the snow, I've seen people sprinkle baking soda over their models. HOWEVER, apparently the stuff starts to eat through the model in five or so years. There's alternatives out there, but I don't know the specifics. Before sprinkling whatever you want on though, and this is just off the top of my head, so try it out on something you don't want to see if it works if you want to try it. Dilute some acrylic paint HEAVILY, and airbrush the tank from the top, to give a subtle effect of frost on the tank. But go easy, so you don't get runny frost coloured water flowing everywhere."
modelmakers,38hy9p,BOB_9000,1 point,Thu Jun 4 20:31:07 2015 UTC,"Also, on a sidenote, a couple of things. If you want to respray your green (to do the rust and whatnot), darken it up a bit on the second go, it looks a bit too candy-apple IMO, also take the respray opportunity to deal with those mold lines on the gun barrel. Also a tip for making rubber tracks more realistic, there's ways to get it to droop a little on the top parts, to make them look more weighty. I've forgotten how to do that though, as I mostly stick to solid plastic pieces. Do some research on that before carrying on if you can. It'll make a huge difference.   As a whole, this model looks promising. Really looking forward to see the end result. Keep us posted!"

However I have now applied the decals (first time ever doing this) and they went on pretty well, I also painted the grills on the back black and painted a silvery metallic colour on the track wheels where they would touch the tracks. I plan to gloss clear coat the whole model and then apply a wash to the detailed parts of the model. Then another clear coat and a filter to dull the paint colour a little, a matt coat, then hairspray and white acrylic paint for snow camo. Finally then some small rust and streaks and another wash and then mud details.   Would this be roughly the right way to go about it?   Thanks a lot!"

So this would probably would for your purposes if you use a mop or something to apply it. Future dries clear and strips with ammonia, sounds like it'd work for your purposes. Coating drying time is measured in hours for full cure, I think, but it gets tacky very quickly. The ammonia might affect the stickers though, so I'd test before applying if your intent is to have permanent stickers.   A more permanent finish might be something like this:  http://www.amazon.com/Pour-On-Varnish-Provides-Gorgeous-Appearance/dp/B000PEGLBS  This is not something you'd be able to strip off once it's coated. You would also need to test to see that it doesn't react to the stickers (but that's something you should do regardless of what you plan to seal this stuff with.)   There MIGHT be a spray version of future floor polish that might provide the sealing you need, but it might not go on heavy enough.   Also a possibility is spar/urethane varnish."

It looks like it might yellow without UV protection (see the amazon reviews) Envirotex lite pour on finish.   You might be better served with a brush applied urethane varnish, the kind you get at home depot.   The other commonly used method is what you see in bars where coins and other objects are embedded into the bartop:   http://www.finishing.com/123/62.shtml  Some kind of bar table coat epoxy, which seems permanent to me.

For the glass I'm just using Tamiya masking tape, mostly the 6mm stuff. The center panel on the canopy (the arch directly over the pilot's head) is exactly 6mm, so I was able to get away with using the 6mm tape and only had to trim it off at each end. I think the back glass piece I may have used 18mm,but it's still one piece. What I did was wrap it over the arch, then put a slit down the middle about 3/4 of the way so it would fold over itself. Then I trimmed off the sides and the back. For my upcoming He 111Z though, I did come up with a complete Big Ed kit including masks.

Whirlwinds may very well have been able to help on that raid, although they typically only had a range of about 800 miles - if they could have been fitted with slipper tanks or something they may very well have been a huge help.  Last night I got the FB to the point where it's ready for the gloss coat before the decals. Guns are on, props are on, exhausts are on - it finally has taken shape. Tonight I'll get the 37mm prototype to that point too.

Don't get me wrong - it was a great plane and made a serious contribution - but I still have a soft spot for the Hurricane and the Tempest. There's a lot of that, though. The Lancaster is favored over the Halifax, even though the two performed the same duties and were built in similar numbers. The Mosquito is favored over the... well, let's face it - Hampdens and Blenheims have nothing on the Mosquito.  As for the exhausts - me too. On the FB I smudged paint all over the place. I did the prototype's exhausts last night and did a little better - I only got one stuck to my finger and only for a brief moment. After they were on I realized that they were not all supposed to be burnt iron, though - they were sheathed so I went back and painted everything but the tips (a little more shows on the inboard ones since they're longer).

modelmakers,38dley,llordlloyd,1 point,Sat Jun 6 14:04:23 2015 UTC,"The more I've reflected on it over the years, the more I think the British have a rather distorted opinion of Fighter Command in general and the Spitfire in particular.  They saved the nation in 1940- fair enough and no real dispute- but for the whole rest of the war they were basically absent compromised where the fighting was hottest, consuming vast amounts of attention and resources while doing very little to actually harm Germany or meaningfully support the wider British war effort.  Churchill and the FC commanders- after shamefully elbowing Dowding aside- refused to send Spitfires to the Middle East, Singapore, Burma etc, pissing them away in Rhubarbs and other meaningless baiting of the small Luftwaffe presence in France... the Germans responding by engaging on their own terms and exacting a large kill ratio. The the Prinz Eugen, Scharnhorst and Gneisenau dashed through the Channel, Beauforts and Swordfishes went in unescorted just miles from FC's largest stations.  The situations where the very-short-range Spit could have made a real difference, it was held back in favour of the obsolete (as a fighter, even in 1940) Hurricane, Kittyhawk and Buffalo (!).  A great plane indeed, and a masterpiece of engineering, but the wrong thing for the jobs it was (mostly) committed to.  Those shrouded exhausts... they've caught me out on a Mosquito before.

The Buffalo - I knew they had them but I'm not very aware of the usage. But trying to take on a 109 or 190 in a barrel with wings on it just seems suicidal.

I destroyed two different unit codes (the pair of letters), and there were only two units flying the Whirlwind, so there weren't any others to choose from. One was ""HE"", so I took the opportunity to cut up some of the single letters I wasn't going to use and I turned an F into an E and another F into an H with the help of a P. In the end, this bird's gonna represent a few planes instead of just one - the serial number is different from what it should be because I messed it up, too. Realistically nobody will ever know that but it'll still bug me a little. The roundels went on smoothly though. I'll probably finish decals on the FB tonight, then get started on the decals on the prototype."
modelmakers,38dley,llordlloyd,1 point,Mon Jun 8 13:40:43 2015 UTC,"I guess naturally the historic focus is on what the military did do, not what it didn't. And in mitigation one has to bear in mind that 1941-42 was a very bleak time for Britain, worse in a sense than 1940 when there was nothing to do but survive. Into 1941 it was standing alone with few resources and a basically incompetent army, then allied to the USSR which was getting flogged and demanding help, the US finally coming in in December but unable to immediately help.  But IMO fighter jocks being the sort of guys they are in all countries, they wanted to be in what they saw as the main area fighting their old BoB enemies, with the adoring ladies nearby.  Spitfires should have been deployed to the Mediterranean area far earlier. The Buffs were the key fighter in Asia and demands for something better were too few, and ignored, as the inevitability of war became clear. Instead, a willful, racist and arrogant ignorance of Japanese capabilities and equipment meant the local commanders propagandised the Buffalo as an excellent plane. They were of course cut down even by obsolete Japanese aircraft, the Hyabusas and Ki-44s totally outclassing them, and the Hurricanes rushed in too late (this was early 1942). Inexcusable after two full years of war.  I'm Australian so I'm quite interested in this campaign.  The Spits were sent to Malta only when the island was almost beyond saving, and when the only viable way to get them there was by the hazardous and elaborate means of flying them in from aircraft carriers (an option the US entry into the war made realistic). They made an instant difference to the situation.  I could have a look for leftover decals from my kit (the 'Cannon Fighter' boxing), though I might have lost them. Sounds like you're cracking on with it, though. My models will probably never be looked at by anyone other than myself and girlfriend, and the odd passer-by in the house. But still, those little things are important, aren't they? I usually avoid a 'serial unknown' decal option, despite that being silly, I shouldn't only memorialise planes where we happen to have all the information."

I have to apply lots of Mr Mark Softer to it, put pressure, then reapplied, puncture some air pocket, then press again....   The worst part is the rear rudder: The decal was about 2mm bigger than the rudder, which means I have to cut it or wrap it around. I decided to wrap it around but it is very fragile and some tear apart and leaves the trail you see there.  And the fit was terrible too (for my rookie fitting skill at least :D )... The wing and fuselage misfits, leaving 2mm gap in the area below the cockpit. I have to RESHAPE the entire area using putty and sculpting knife.  The details around the landing gear struts and panels are minimal.  Other than that, this thing is a weekend treat for sure!"

modelmakers,38ei0k,alaskafish,1 point,Wed Jun 3 18:06:29 2015 UTC,"You answered your own question. It depends.   If you want to experiment with this stuff, then get some watercolors matching the same colors you describe, because they wash off with water and you can test the effect.  It depends on the color of the airframe, and personal perferences. I use both, depending on what color it is, and it's really about a ""It looks about Right."" I've used everything from light brown to flat out black."
modelmakers,38ei0k,windupmonkeys,2,Wed Jun 3 18:39:10 2015 UTC,"But what do you prefer, is my question/"
modelmakers,38ei0k,windupmonkeys,1 point,Wed Jun 3 19:02:22 2015 UTC,"Again, it depends. There is no absolute answer for this. My preferences change by project and there's no ""standard answer"" even for myself. Also, models photograph differently than what our eye sees, so what looks pretty in a photograph might actually look horrendous in person.   Light/bare metal airframes with too dark washes (dark brown, black) look silly. Dark airframes with dark colors make no sense.   For the grey aircraft, it can be more towards the dark brown/gray/black range, it depends on where the area is. See my F/A-18E in 1/144. The wash is a sludge of payne's gray, and a touch of raw umber.  http://imgur.com/a/YMU4a"
modelmakers,38ei0k,windupmonkeys,1 point,Wed Jun 3 20:01:39 2015 UTC,"There is also a third alternative: prebuilt mixes and guides written by Mig productions, AK, and the Spanish companies.   A cottage industry has sprung up in the last 5 years that has since swept the model press by storm, where they offer everything from particular effects (rain, grime, snow, mud, oil, whatever), to specific color ""modulation"" effects (dark, light, shadow, worn paint, chipping fluids). Often sold in ""packs"" that encourage you to buy a product for every single effect you want to create, while providing professional/expert builder advice on how to achieve or clone their effects that they've become known for.   That would remove much of your questions, because someone has already figured it out for you (as well as dilution, chemistry, mix ratios, paint compatibility).   I personally stick with very ""easy remove"" materials like pencil graphite, pastel chalk (poor man's weathering powder), acrylic gel mediums, and watercolors. I rarely use oil washes because I find the smells unpleasant and cleanup tedious.   I also tend towards ""cleaner"" builds because after spending all that time building a model I can't be bothered emulating field conditions in many cases, save for armor models.   Finally, there's a modern trend towards dirtying up just about everything, including things where it might be excessive. Preshading and the like are very useful techniques, but when overused, create visually interesting but not actually accurate paint and wear patterns.   There was a hilarious ""letters to the editor"" from a former tank crewer in Fine Scale Modeler in the last year or so, where a former tank crew member said ""STOP IT WITH THE RUSTING TANK TREADS."" He claimed that operational tank treads, while muddy, would NOT be rusted; instead, rocks and asphalt would tend to polish it in a color more like a gunmetal/black color. There's some truth to this. Further, Spencer Pollard, even 10 years ago, said something like (He used to write for a now defunct magazine, but has taken up shop elsewhere with other English magazines) ""there is a trend these days of weathering everything up to the eyeballs, without any regard to how the originals might have survived in combat."" (It was for a review of a Revell 1/32 HE-162, which frankly, would've had very short operational lifespans from finishing of construction to final disposition).   If you want an example of this taken to the extreme, see Revell Germany's box art models of the 1/32 Hawker Hunter (preshading on panel lines gone way out of hand), or their 1/32 Hawk T.1A (preshading to the point where it's like the mechanics painted black rings around each drop tank.)"
modelmakers,38ei0k,Fortunate_0ne,2,Wed Jun 3 23:42:21 2015 UTC,"I'm glad to see someone else thinks that the weathering and shading has gotten out of hand. It's like it's become an art form of its own, totally disconnected and counter from the realistic and meticulate nature of most model builders.   We also tend to forget about difficulties of scaling down details and colors. Think of it like this: If you're building a 1/48 scale model, and you're looking at it from an arms length away (roughly 3 feet), that would be roughly equivalent of standing 145 feet away from the actual piece of equipment. If you're leaning in incredibly close to that same model, say 8 inches away, it's still the rough equivalent of standing 30 feet away.   Go stand outside and look at any machine, or structure, up close, then compare how colors and details muddy at those distance.Then consider the effect of different lighting and other things.   I agree, a well pre/post shaded, washed, and weathered model is exceptionally interesting to look at. It shows a great deal of skill and effort, yet looks as ridiculous as over done makeup on a corpse. We go so far to make things look real, even going so far as to debate and argue over subtle shades of interior colors, then add weathering like a hooker uses lipstick. It's amazing how much effort we put into things to make them look real when we might be doing the opposite. For instance, I've seen incredibly weathered P-47 models.  Then, when I look at pictures of many real Thunderbolts in combat theaters, and read historical accounts, I realize that many of those aircraft were doted on, going so far as to be waxed regularly.  All that being said, this is all for fun, so we should just enjoy it and the various skills we all bring to the table. These are all incredibly subjective conclusioms on my part. To be fair, I enjoy looking at what everyone has done, but when it comes to weathering, I think that more and better aren't synonyms."

IIRC it was really about pin washing and drybrushing over and over to give it more ""plastic/3D"" texture and look. I spent about 30 minutes yesterday just browsing where I thought I read it, but to no luck. Maybe someone else read it too and has it somewhere handy.

I went to dip the cap brush back in a little to quickly and tipped the bottle. My workspace is my computer desk in my bedroom. The bottle was at the edge of the cutting mat, and poured right into the spacebar of my keyboard.  Had to act fast, righted the bottle, flipped up the keyboard to drain it (a good amount streamed out), put the keyboard on the carpet, and went to pull away the cutting mat. My mat had started to dissolve, and left a nice long streak on my desk as I pulled it. Mopped that up with a rag, and went to pick up the keyboard, which took some carpet with it.  The aftermath wasn't so bad. My keyboard still works (amazingly). The space bar doesn't work as well (doesn't click when pressed), but it works. The plastic finish has been damaged as well.

modelmakers,38851p,35thArmorGuy,1 point,Wed Jun 3 18:15:46 2015 UTC,"Normally, yea. I should start using a small brush, but I don't like to leave it open too long."

modelmakers,38851p,XenophonTheAthenian,2,Wed Jun 3 01:27:22 2015 UTC,"I got lazy a couple of days ago, decided for whatever reason to forgo gloss coating the interior of my Garupan Pz IVD before weathering it. I think my reasoning was that I didn't want to accidentally get Future all over the exterior before I could paint and prime it, but with me any reasoning is moot. Anyway, long story short...washes turned into filters. Wasn't much of a problem with the oils, but I also tried to put on a very thin grime wash, using Florymodel's water-based one, into certain crevices and stuff. It refused to allow itself to get cleaned up, so I had a perfectly fine grime wash that had also unfortunately bled into the surrounding areas. Luckily for me I was able to largely fix the problem by just applying the grime wash as a general filter over the whole interior, and then kind of aggressively scrubbing that off to make it a little more uneven and allow the cream paint to show through more. Except for a couple of corners that you can't really see (and which blend in just fine when the actual top is on the vehicle) you really can't tell that I done fucked up, but unfortunately the interior is now a little browner than I had wanted. Not that big a deal, though--the Pz IV in Garupan has a strangely buff shade of the cream-colored interior German paint, so it looks about right in the end, and lighting is bad inside the vehicle anyway. I'm really just pissed off with myself that I allowed that to happen--I've seen first-hand in the past what happens when you apply water-based washes to matte, but I did it anyway for some inexplicable reason"

modelmakers,387e4x,Plundersquirrel,1 point,Tue Jun 2 15:02:05 2015 UTC,I always use staples. If you paint and weather them you can barely see them. To me it's not worth the aggravation of buying aftermarket tracks or trying to burn the tracks together
modelmakers,387e4x,HeckleMagpie,3,Tue Jun 2 20:46:55 2015 UTC,"As people have noted already, normal plastic glue won't touch that stuff. Neither will superglue, unfortunately, although it'll hold for just long enough for you to get the tracks almost on and then snap.  I usually do a couple of things with that kind of track-- first, I heat the tip of a small screwdriver in a candle flame (or a lighter) and melt over the tips of the parts that poke through. You have to be careful here or you can damage the parts they poke through and then they won't hold. Once I have that done, I pretty liberally superglue them, trying to get the glue into the gaps between the ends so it'll reinforce the melted-over part and will help hide the gaps a bit.   If none of this works, you can sew them with black thread.  There's also a thing called ""Tricky Stick"" that acts as sort of a primer for superglue on slick plastics like track vinyl. I've only used this once, but it seems to have worked pretty well.  Finally, to avoid stretching the tracks too much (and thus putting strain on the joint), I usually leave off the wheels on the ends-- the drive sprocket and idler-- and put them on at the same time as the tracks. I loop the track over the road wheels, slip the drive sprocket and idler into the ends of the loop, and slip them onto the axle while inside the track."
modelmakers,387e4x,solipsistnation,3,Tue Jun 2 15:34:36 2015 UTC,Alright I'm confused. I've been using a plastic cement for my tracks that I use on my models. It practically welded the tracks together and reading all this it sounds like it's not supposed to?  Do I have a magic cement?
modelmakers,387e4x,peoplerproblems,3,Tue Jun 2 18:23:27 2015 UTC,Depends on the material the track is made of.  Some of the manufacturers use a newer material that will cement together.  The older one-piece vinyl tracks don't work with most cements/glues.
modelmakers,387e4x,RonPossible,2,Tue Jun 2 18:56:42 2015 UTC,"Oh. These are both newer Dragon tracks (a 1/35 Tiger I and a 1/72 Tiger I). Painting them kind of sucks, but they welded nicely."
modelmakers,387e4x,peoplerproblems,2,Tue Jun 2 18:59:05 2015 UTC,"Yeah, Dragon has a special ""DS Plastic"" that's a sort of flexible styrene that CAN be glued with normal plastic model cement. It's a huge improvement over the old-school vinyl or rubber tracks that show up in cheaper and older kits..."
modelmakers,387e4x,solipsistnation,2,Tue Jun 2 19:08:12 2015 UTC,I believe one way is to heat a flat head screwdriver with a hairdryer or something similar then press the end tabs of the track together before melting them.
modelmakers,387e4x,Saelyre,2,Tue Jun 2 11:38:36 2015 UTC,"What kind of glue are you using?  Any glue that is a styrene solvent will work poorly or not at all.  I have had good results with superglue, but I have only tried it with Dragon's rubber band tracks, not Tamiya's.    My own opinion is that The Tamiya vinyl tracks are generally pretty terrible and should be replaced with a good set of aftermarket track.  I understand though that not everyone wants to take the time/expense/bother.  Hope you manage to get yours sorted out."

modelmakers,387e4x,RonPossible,1 point,Tue Jun 2 22:18:22 2015 UTC,"1)  Remove tracks from box.  2)  Inspect tracks.  See how they stretch.  Feel the non-stick surface that repels paint.  3)  Check the pins at one end, and the holes at the other.  This is where the ends join together in an ugly gaping joint.  4)  Take the tracks.  Hold at arms length.  Drop in nearest trash bin.  5)  Order nice aftermarket tracks.  Edit:  As others have said, you have to melt the pins and spread the molten plastic out.  This invariably leaves a gap at that point.  You can hide that behind the skirts (if the tank has any) or under a roadwheel.  They look ok on a tank with support rollers, but look really bad on one without, as they hang like a rubber band rather than heavy track links.  Some people try to tie the track down towards the road wheels to get it to hang right (use black thread).  The biggest problem with the Tamiya tracks is they don't take paint well, and they don't age well.  The seem to shrink and get brittle over time.  The aformentioned gap gets worse.  Sometimes they pull apart or break.  Any paint starts flaking off."

modelmakers,387e4x,RonPossible,2,Tue Jun 2 17:43:12 2015 UTC,"Not bad.  How does it look when it's stretched on the model?  Those look better than the older ones.  The pins are nearer the outer edges of the track, rather than the center, which should help prevent gapping."
modelmakers,387e4x,solipsistnation,2,Tue Jun 2 18:53:25 2015 UTC,"I haven't finished that one (it's the one I'm doing for a tutorial, but I haven't updated it in a long time) but I'll put them on sometime soonish.   Those are the super old ones-- that's Tamiya's old-school Panzer II. They're really narrow, though, which helps."
modelmakers,387e4x,RonPossible,3,Tue Jun 2 19:09:03 2015 UTC,"I thought they looked familiar.  I have the same kit.  Yea, the narrow ones do better.

I've already gone back and replaced the old vinyl tracks on my Panther and Jagdpanther after they shrunk and seperated.  Time to do that on the II as well, I guess."

modelmakers,3850if,FlyingSMonster,6,Mon Jun 1 22:14:16 2015 UTC,"I've had this kit in my stash for a few months, started working on it months ago, but ran into problems with the fit of the fuselage and decided to stop. Last week though I got the urge to finally finish it, as the Ta-152 is one of (in my opinion) the most beautiful aircraft out there.  Once I got painting though the work went very quickly. I used some photo etch interior decals because the decals ZM provides with the kit for the instruments are, well shit to be honest. It's a shame ZM charges so much extra for the extra details, especially considering the kit itself is already very expensive. I also used metal gun barrels for the 20mm guns, pitot tube and other antennas on the aircraft.   The ZM Instructions were great, but their color images could be printed better, as sometimes its really hard to make out the colors. Their painting guide could have been a lot more clear as well, and they only provide instructions for one single variant, though the decals allow you to number the aircraft basically any way you want.   I weathered it very subtly, as the aircraft was only in service for a few months before the war ended and saw very limited use. Only 43 aircraft were actually produced of the type.   It was painted with Model Master enamel paints, and weathered with enamel streaking grimes and an enamel wash over an acrylic gloss coat.   While I was building this kit I also picked up another ZM kit, their P-51D. Gonna see how it compares to my already finished Tamiya P-51D kit in 1:32 as well."
modelmakers,3850if,Jacobean89,3,Mon Jun 1 22:20:06 2015 UTC,Absolutely terrific. A Zoukei-Mura is on the christmas list. Any suggestions for a ZM?
modelmakers,3850if,Jacobean89,2,Tue Jun 2 03:22:02 2015 UTC,"Their earlier kits have some issues, but overall they are very high quality kits, definitely some of the best on the market for 1:32 aircraft.  My main criticism of them is how expensive the kits are, and how they do not come with photo etch or any metal parts. They also include masks for the canopy, which is nice, but never the inside of the canopy, only the outside. Worst yet is that the photo etch ZM sells is incredibly expensive. For example, just for two small photo etch gunbay doors for the P-51D I'm working on they wanted $23. It's just a single small fret and its incredibly expensive for what it is.   Their instructions are fantastic though, definitely the best instructions you will ever use to build a kit. Photographic images included and I have yet to run into an error.   I've only built two of their kits (soon to be 3 with P-51D), but the J2M Raiden was a fantastic kit that I would highly recommend to you. I built it with only the metal gun barrels, none of the photo etch, and the interior detail is still astounding. If you look in my past post history you can probably find pictures of it. Excellent kit overall.   I really want to build their Ho-229, but that thing is really expensive and massive, not sure I even have room to display it!"
modelmakers,3850if,Extra330SC,2,Tue Jun 2 05:22:14 2015 UTC,I've been reading about the Ho-229. What a beast! If I had a spare life maybe.  The Raiden is beautiful! and again well done on the Ta-152! Can't wait to see the P-51!

modelmakers,3850if,BorisIvanovich,4,Mon Jun 1 22:51:38 2015 UTC,"This needs more upvotes.  Very nice airbrush work. Photo 13, the pre-shading effect on the RLM76 color on the fuselage looks spot on, in my opinion. Honestly, the way the model looks in photo 17 is the way I would have left it. My only criticism is that the wash near the inner wing area looks a little too heavy, and that's really just to my own taste.  The mottling looks great, taking the time to mask and paint insignias (I never do this) makes a difference. I really think your paint work is superb. The filtering effect isn't something I do either but it's nice in the larger scale to create small variations in tone. Your finish has a good amount of depth to it, and that goes a long way towards making a plastic model look like a metal airplane that's been shrunk down.  Great work, I really like this one."
modelmakers,3850if,The_name_is_Fig,2,Tue Jun 2 01:12:43 2015 UTC,"Thanks a lot! I never actually planned to mask and stencil the insignias, but they were simple enough that just using Tamiya masking tape worked out really well.   You're right about the inner wing being too dark. That's not from the wash though, I left a little bit too much pre-shading there. Could probably go back and fix that if I wanted to."

It's a little obscure, being delivered right at the end of WWII and not seeing any action until Korea, but I'm going to have some fun with this project and do a ""what-if"" build as if the invasion of Japan had taken place and the Tigercat had seen action during the operation.

modelmakers,385g9l,BOB_9000,3,Tue Jun 2 00:02:55 2015 UTC,"Those unsightly marks are called ""tide marks."" I'm not sure what causes them but I am going to guess it's the pigment not being integrated properly with the thinner. You probably mixed up your wash just fine but it's not drying right on the model, maybe the oil is drying too slowly while the thinner is evaporating too quickly? Maybe try applying a wash over a flatter finish so the oil soaks in and integrates with the paint a little better. I always apply oil washes over gloss surfaces but I do aircraft and I only want the wash to stay in panel lines. Any wash that is sitting outside of panel lines tends to take forever to dry and it won't look right when it does dry. I'm really not sure what causes those marks but I've had them before.   You can probably blend out most of those marks with a dry Q-tip or try to ""reactivate"" the wash with a brush dampened with thinner. Maybe you can work the wash back into the surface so it looks more like what you expected."

modelmakers,385q9v,ionizzatore,1 point,Wed Jun 3 12:22:46 2015 UTC,"If you want to freehand it, maybe make a hole a piece of cardboard or something and hold it in front of the can to narrow the dispersion cone. If you want to adjust, move the cardboard further or closer. I don't use these things so it's just speculation on my part, so don't try this directly on your model. About the dots, maybe make yourself a stencil or something."
modelmakers,385q9v,BOB_9000,1 point,Tue Jun 2 02:58:55 2015 UTC,"Sounds great, I will test out the cardboard trick tomorrow. If it's not great I can always just mask it all up.  I'm going to use acrylics for the dots, the Tamiya paint seems to work fine on their spray enamels."
modelmakers,385q9v,BOB_9000,1 point,Tue Jun 2 03:28:26 2015 UTC,"I advise you don't change medium for the dots. Acrylics and enamel have drastically different textures, and the dots'll likely look too matte and out of place."

modelmakers,37z5q3,LOLtheism,3,Sun May 31 18:02:33 2015 UTC,Brown paint and baking soda. There are better ways but I'm a cheapskate.
modelmakers,37z5q3,BOB_9000,1 point,Sun May 31 18:03:15 2015 UTC,That's the same method I've tried. It never did look muddy enough for my liking. Does the job for dried dirt though.
modelmakers,37z5q3,LOLtheism,1 point,Sun May 31 21:16:24 2015 UTC,"Aye, it's pretty hit or miss, which is bad for the final step of a lot of work"
modelmakers,37z5q3,BOB_9000,1 point,Mon Jun 1 03:38:28 2015 UTC,That's clever. I might try mixing that with my regular pigment-based mud to get a more uneven mud tone.
modelmakers,37z5q3,Plundersquirrel,1 point,Mon Jun 1 02:05:56 2015 UTC,"I'd honestly advise against it. If you have the actual pigment, I would stay away from improvising like this. It'll look sloppy and crusty. And not in the way one would want when weathering. An alternative  you might want to try (I can't vouch for this, never tried), is coat your areas with a thin layer of superglue (before painting, sprinkle baking soda on, shake off the excess. This'll give a rough texture without having to apply any mud. So I assume you can paint those areas brown, and then add your regular pigment based stuff on top, for extra layers.  I have applied this method to rusty exhaust pipes, and that looks great, never tried to simulate mud with it though."

modelmakers,380ca1,Qarlo,5,Sun May 31 22:25:58 2015 UTC,"I haven't built the Zvezda KV-2, but Trumpeter's version was my first model kit. That, and given Zvezda's reputation, I'd say go with Trumpeter.   The Link and length tracks were a little tricky for me, but it's doable. Just remember if you want to paint it, don't glue the wheels on or glue the treads to the wheels. This way you can slide off the completed treads, paint them, then put them back on.   Edit: I'm pretty sure the Trumpeter kit comes with vinyl treads too. Never used vinyl treads, and most people don't like them. Also, harder to get that track sag with the vinyls."

The build went off without a hitch, and painting it, well it's russian, so it's relatively simple. It's a big flat ugly box (kit's nicely done, I'm talking about the real thing), so if you aren't planning on using an airbrush, this is probably the most forgiving tank for that. A large KV2 is probably the best place to start."
modelmakers,37yffm,SwoleEE,6,Sun May 31 13:26:55 2015 UTC,"This review is for Frontier Wargaming's paint and tool organizer set.   BACKGROUND - I'm new to this hobby, just now building my first armor kit. I've spent several years working with RC trucks and helicopters, so scale models and their assembly isn't a completely foreign world to me.  REASONING - A place for everything, and everything in it's place. I love an organized work space. I didn't want to scratch build something, so after a few evenings of searching I found this beauty. Originally the model I found was from CNC Workshop out of Australia. I searched for an American distributor, but couldn't find one. So I purchased this set on eBay for $75 after shipping. It was shipped from Latvia, which took about four weeks.  BUILD QUALITY - All the pieces are precision cut out of MDF and looked and felt sturdy. There were only two trivial defects I encountered. The first was on a side wall for a corner unit. The pieces are supposed to have a small circle inscribed on the outside surface to indicate where the magnets should be glued, but both side walls were duplicates, so on one side these circles are on the interior of the unit. It doesn't affect assembly at all, but it was out of place. The second issue  was a locating hole in the bottom plate of the corner paint stand was cut wrong. I had to trim two vertical pieces at the bottom tier of this unit to get them to fit. No big deal, but a defect all the same.  ASSEMBLY - Everything fit together well, and felt solid afterward. The instructions say you can build without glue, and I'd believe it. However, I chose to apply a small dab of wood glue at each joint, just for good measure. The corner units required a little more care to get all the pieces to mesh, but overall it took no more than 90 minutes start to finish, and shouldn't be difficult if you take your time.  FEATURES - This is a one stop shop for paints and tools. This universal model has holes drilled for all different brush and tool sizes, and fits all popular models of paint. The plates where the paints sit are drilled wide at the top to accommodate your larger diameter paint bottles like Citadel or Tamiya, and smaller bottles like my Vallejo sit one level deeper. All the labels are visible, and legible thanks to the cutouts at the front of each tier. There's even a small hole in the base of each paint well that will hold the tips of dropper bottles if you like to store them upside down. The cutting mat in my pictures is 24X18 inches, so the set should fit any average work space.  VERDICT - I am very happy with my purchase. Everything I will frequently use is kept nearby and readily identifiable. It may seem a little expensive, but I'd rather have the right tool for the job, and this is it."

modelmakers,37yffm,sharkdog73,1 point,Sun May 31 13:42:54 2015 UTC,I'm fond of the burned edges myself. The instructions actually state that these sides are up and out during assembly; the backside is a uniform light tone without burning. $20 shipping definitely jacked up the price on this.

modelmakers,37ygvo,Swazi666,2,Sun May 31 13:43:15 2015 UTC,"Europe here (italy). I've bought several times from HLJ.   If something is in ""Backordered"", do not trust the ""Usually ships within 4 to 6 weeks"" notice. It can take longer, it may stay in that state forever. Buy ""Backordered"" products only if you want that product but you can live without it for some time (for example: i backordered 6 rolls of tamiya tape, but i still have some roll in my tool stash, i can wait) I don't know about germany, but a package over 3000Y will trigger custom fees. Sometimes the cost of the product + shipping + customs is way inferior of the cost of that product in europe (i recentely checked the price for the RB-79 Ball, 13 euros on HLJ, 35 euros on amazon...) Send everything to the private warehouse. Once you have everything you want there, create your shipment. This is useful because things can stay in the private warehouse for 60 days, you can buy other things in the meanwile, or delay the shipping (i know a person that lives alone, this means that no one is home during the usual delivery hours. He ships everything to his office, he delays august/july shippings until september so he is sure that the office is open). IMHO the best shipping method is SAL Registered. A bit pricy but it's tracked (not that i do not trust people who work in italian customs but... let's say that if it's not registered something may disappear...). Unfortunately it seems that you cannot receive SAL-R shippings in Germany so yur only options are ""regular"" SAL or EMS. Regular SAL is not tracked. I've never tried EMS. HLJ will take some time to update your orders. Tipically if you buy something ""in stock"" or ""low stock"" you will receive an order confirmation mail, then a payment request mail, then the product will be placed in private warehouse, then you create the shipping, then another confirmation and another payment request... I'ts a bit tricky but you'll get used to it. Once you receive a payment request you have 3 days to fulfill that payment. Payment is via PayPal but you can use your credit card without a paypal account.   I think that that's it. If you have any other question feel free to ask! (:"
modelmakers,37ygvo,ionizzatore,2,Mon Jun 1 08:39:23 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the insightful commentary. I am sure the shipment plus customs fees amount to a lot.

modelmakers,37ygvo,AsimovsRobot,1 point,Mon Jun 1 16:16:04 2015 UTC,So you have to order quite a lot of stuff to make it worth it?
modelmakers,37ygvo,ionizzatore,1 point,Mon Jun 1 14:50:32 2015 UTC,"Only if the difference of price is really high, otherwise you should stay under 3000Y.  A pratical example:   Product A costs 4000Y here, 3050Y on HLJ. 3050+1000(shipping)+610(20% of 3000). You will pay 4660Y, buying here is more convenient Product B costs 16500Y (120 euro) here, 10000Y on HLJ. 10000+1000(shipping)+2000(20% of 10000). You will pay 13000Y, 25 euros less! (real world example, this was the cost of my Metal Gear Rex that i bought from a japanese seller instead of amazon). This is the incontrovertible proof that the Metal Gear was shipped directly from japan (newspaper used as bubble wrap)"
modelmakers,37ygvo,pxpxpx,2,Mon Jun 1 16:09:06 2015 UTC,"As /u/ionizzatore posted earlier. Order backordered items at your own risk. Sometimes you get them, sometimes you don't.   In Sweden there is customs and VAT on any orders* over €20-ish, and IIRC it's the same in Germany. As a private person you might not have to pay VAT and customs depending on how much the customs have to do the week your items arrive, but don't count on it.  I don't know how they calculate customs/duty fees in Germany but here in Sweden it's on top of the value with  VAT. So if you import something with a total value* of €100, 25% VAT (lol Sweden!) is added and then the duty fee on top of that. So I'd would end up paying a total of €135 (€10 duty fee).  * product amount + shipping"

modelmakers,37xubq,spedmor,7,Sun May 31 08:25:20 2015 UTC,"Ok, heres a few painting tips Clean the model with some warm water and dish soap (not dishwasher soap) before painting and rinse well Acrylic paints generally need a coat of primer first.  This gives a slightly rough surface for them to stick to. Make sure your paint is mixed by shaking it for a minute or so. It also looks like you do not have enough paint on your brush so it doesn't coat thickly enough. Look at the FAQ section on the right of this page for more tips."
modelmakers,37xubq,Flabergie,4,Sun May 31 08:47:09 2015 UTC,"Flabergie said it already but always use a primer before going to paint.  That plastic is really smooth, so the paint will not really attach to it. So you will use a primer to get your surface something rougher.  And always thin your paint. Thats really important. I always give a model 2-3 thin layers of paint instead of 1 thick layer. You can loose details of a model under a thick layer of paint."
modelmakers,37xubq,Fannon,3,Sun May 31 10:57:58 2015 UTC,"Looks like paint needs shaking, Vallejo is infamous for this make sure you really shake it vigorously. Vallejo generally brush paints really well. I don't make prime if I'm painting small pieces, if I was to paint a large area like the car I'd defiantly prime and thin the paint."
modelmakers,37xubq,frugm1,2,Sun May 31 16:51:03 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I also think you need to mix that paint really well before painting with it. I use a lot of Vallejo paint, and they always take a TON of mixing and shaking before they're usable. I have some black that I haven't mixed up yet and it's separated into a thick black sludge and an almost clear liquid-- looks to me like you're painting with the clear part there...  You can use a toothpick or wooden skewer, even, to scrape up the pigment from the bottom of the bottle to help it mix. And if you want to get super into it, drop a couple of BBs into the bottle to act like the rattleball in spray paint.   Usually I squeeze a little out into a bottlecap and paint from that rather than from the bottle, too."
modelmakers,37xubq,solipsistnation,1 point,Sun May 31 17:02:18 2015 UTC,I know some people have added rust proof ball bearings to there pots  of vallejo paint to aid mixing it when they shake seems to work pretty well.  Also if  you are going to sand three brush strokes out like duke suggested I'd go even finer than 400 grit. Maybe 800 or even 1200 grit would be more suitable.  I always just shake my vallejo and haven't had any issues with it mixing. I've noticed some colors take more shaking then others though.
modelmakers,37xubq,frugm1,1 point,Mon Jun 1 01:35:44 2015 UTC,"NO! I worked in a paint shop. Shaking does not get the job done. Shake the paint until you think your arm will fall off then stick a stirring stick in there and see how much un-mixed sludge from the bottom of the jar is on your stir stick. The others were right about cleaning and priming the model. I would suggest using an airbrush to paint but a can of spray paint will give better results than brush painting in this situation. and shake it until your arm falls off. LOL. Seriously, shake the spray can until you think it doesn't sound like it needs to be shaken any more and go another few minutes."
modelmakers,37xubq,Duke_of_Fritzburg,1 point,Sun May 31 17:42:14 2015 UTC,will any spray paint due if its white and thanks for the tips
modelmakers,37xubq,Duke_of_Fritzburg,1 point,Sun May 31 19:12:14 2015 UTC,yes. Pretty much any spray paint will do. For an automotive finish you will want a perfect smooth glossy finish and your brush strokes might show through. You might need to wet sand with a 400 grit sandpaper before you spray.
modelmakers,37x5he,BOB_9000,2,Sun May 31 03:26:23 2015 UTC,"I'd agree that the green is too light, possibly too much yellow tone in it and too light. It'd work well as the highlight tone for a russian vehicle though!  The chipping is nice in some areas, well done! But in other places it looks a bit much for the scale, namely the front left (the tank's left) corner/edge and on the center of the rear hatch and other wide, flat panels. The oil pooling could be thinned up more on the back engine panel.  Not a knock but a tip, mix up a lighter brown to paint the handles on the tools. It adds color variation and makes things pop! Also add a little black inside the barrel of the gun, 1/72 can use all the tricks it can get to add some depth.  Otherwise great first model and in 1/72 too! Look forward to seeing more from you!"
modelmakers,37x5he,LemonGear,2,Sun May 31 20:00:05 2015 UTC,I think that another problem is that the edges of the camo are too soft.  And... Just no. That black is too heavy an thick!

What I did is used a really thin coat for the base layer, to simulate dried old leaks, and thicker enamel for fresh wet oil. So that's to explain the darkness and thickness.   As for the camo, do you mean the edges of the tank or the places where colours meet? If you're just talking colours, I agree, that was my first time doing camo without masking.

modelmakers,37x5he,alaskafish,2,Sun May 31 21:09:44 2015 UTC,"What green is it if you don't mind? I think I know how it can be used very lightly in some color modulation on a BT-5 I'm going to be working on for a groupbuild. Layers of weathering, pastels, and both flat and gloss coats tend to darken and remove detail. For 1/72, I've found leaning towards over-exaggeration to be a good thing for color modulation in the past... granted I've only been building armor for about 5-ish months now so I'm still experimenting with color and weathering... you might be right about it being too much in-person.  That looks like a nice build. Granted I'm pretty biased and prefer 1/72 armor, I feel like you could have wrung more detail out of a larger canvas. Also for both builds, I find under-weathering is better than over-weathering but that's honestly probably a subjective thing. It's easier to build up to a good amount of weathering than to come down from too much. But keep it up man, you're on the right track!"
modelmakers,37x5he,alaskafish,1 point,Sun May 31 21:33:07 2015 UTC,"Russian armour's a strange thing. The early war stuff, BT series, T-26s, T-30s, things like that were relatively brightly coloured. But afterwards, things like the KVs, T34s, and ISs tend to be of a much darker shade of green. But even for an early tank, the green I used here is too bland, it'd need to be a bit brighter, more strident.   As for the Pz35(t), I may have overdone the grime streaks slightly, but I found it to be somewhat necessary. Due to the already dark base coat, in person it's hard to see much of the weathering. This of course is a non issue to a camera."

From the wiki:   A comment's score is simply the number of upvotes minus the number of downvotes. If five users like the comment and three users don't it will have a score of 2. Please note that the vote numbers are not ""real"" numbers, they have been ""fuzzed"" to prevent spam bots etc. So taking the above example, if five users upvoted the comment, and three users downvote it, the upvote/downvote numbers may say 23 upvotes and 21 downvotes, or 12 upvotes, and 10 downvotes. The points score is correct, but the vote totals are ""fuzzed"".   So the vote totals are correct, but the number of upvotes and downvotes is not--reddit automatically tries to generate a false number of downvotes that is roughly equal to the number of upvotes, while preserving the total. This is why, for example, by default only the percentage of people who have upvoted a post is displayed on the right side, because reddit fuzzes the number of actual votes, so that wouldn't be helpful at all"

You can make a tank or airplane build into something for more experienced modelers, and you can likewise keep a ship model a simpler build by not adding photo-etch, etc.   The problem is that ships, even without pe parts, are full of masts, aa guns, spotlights, recessed areas (that are both difficult to mask and difficult to reach with a paintbrush) and so on.    There is a group think that you HAVE to have photo-etch and details on ship models, but I've seen some really crapily-built ship models with details and some beautiful ones without.    As I said it's not a problem of pe, it's a problem of number of tiny parts that need to be placed and painted.

I'm not overly familiar worth this aircraft, but some such as the B25 I'm building at moment has raised panel lines.

It is a series of combined and joint training exercises led by American and Egyptian forces in Egypt. These exercises began in 1980, rooted in the Camp David Accords. After its signing, the military forces of Egypt and the United States agreed to conduct coalition training in Egypt.  They are designed to strengthen ties between the Egyptian and the United States Central Command and demonstrate and enhance the ability of the Americans to reinforce their allies in the Middle East in the event of war. These deployments usually are centered at the large Cairo West Air Base. During the period following the liberation of Kuwait (Operation Desert Storm), these exercises have grown larger and have included as many as 11 countries and 70,000 personnel. Other allied nations joining Bright Star exercises in Egypt include the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Italy, Greece, the Netherlands, Jordan, Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates.  The exercise begins with coalition interoperability training to teach nations how to operate with one another in a wartime environment, then continues with a Command Post Exercise designed to help standardize command and control procedures, and then a large-scale Field Training Exercise to practice everything together.

Also saves a ton of desk-space.   I just recently got that airbrush booth. It's an artograph 1530. It works really well, but the fans being on the bottom is not something I'm really getting used to. It makes it kinda awkward to spray from, but at least it takes the fumes away much better than my older homemade booth. I actually have to stand up to airbrush though, which is honestly a good thing so I'm not sitting down all day while working on something.   Currently working on a Zoukei-Mura Ta-152, just about to start work on the camouflage. That P-51D is my next project once I'm done with the 152, just got it yesterday! I've already built Tamiya's 1:32 P-51D, and from the looks of it Zoukei-Muras is also really nice.   That huge Tiger I sitting on the shelf is something I used to have fully painted, but stripped the paint and started over again. I was actually just working on it a few days ago, then got discouraged when the camouflage wasn't turning out the way I would like it to, and I shelved it again... On the bright side, as soon as I did that I started working on the Ta-152 and I'm making very good progress on it.   I use Detolf display cases. I found out a way to give them more shelf space by using these metal rope ties that can be placed around the support structure.

modelmakers,37pom1,flounderflound,2,Fri May 29 13:20:39 2015 UTC,That's not a bad setup.  I like how you have good light from the windows.  That's one thing I'm really lacking.    You're killing it though with the yellow glow from that light bulb.  Consider replacing it with a daylight bulb.  I've found it makes a world of difference.
modelmakers,37pom1,frugm1,2,Fri May 29 14:33:24 2015 UTC,"That's a great idea. I usually find myself working late at night after the kids go to bed, so the window is only useful during those rare occasions when I get to work in the daytime. A daylight bulb though - that'd be freakin' awesome. I'm gonna do that - thanks!"

It also serves as a workstation for knife making, jewelry, wood working and a gun bench. We are moving to a bigger house next Summer and so I'm stuck with that until then..  On the bench right now is a huge 1/16 Rolls Royce Phantom II Continental. It's a vintage rare kit with wood parts for the dash, a museum stand with ropes, cables, canvas roof and such. I'm turning it into a dirty rat rod and I'll call it the Rat Royce.  I see you're doing wood ships, I've always been interested in doing one of those; any suggestion for something easy for starter?"
modelmakers,37pom1,Anonieme_Angsthaas,1 point,Sat May 30 13:00:09 2015 UTC,I would start with a solid hull for sure. If you decide to jump into plank-on-hull than its a very steep learning curve.  Most of the tools needed cross over into plastics so it shouldn't be a huge stretch. The only difference is the cutting and bending of the wood.   http://www.themodelshipwright.com/construction-articles/types-of-ship-model-kits/

modelmakers,37t31m,alaskafish,1 point,Sat May 30 04:10:42 2015 UTC,"Oven cleaner is supposed to work, the spray kind.   Slower but far less noxious: simple green cleanser, but you'll have to soak it for a few days, perhaps; for example, I once had a shelby cobra with a hood painted with spray testors enamel, it stripped it off in a few days and any residuals were cleared off with a very soft brush to get in the crevices. Easy Off spray oven cleaner is the one I've heard recommended, but that stuff is noxious as all hell."
modelmakers,37t31m,windupmonkeys,2,Sat May 30 04:55:33 2015 UTC,"I use Purple Power to strip enamels and acrylics. It works not within days, but within minutes, and with a toothbrush to help scrub it can come completely off within an hour.   You can get large 2 gallon jugs of the stuff for cheap at Lowes / Home Depot, etc. You can either just straight up use it from the jug, or dilute it, but it will take longer to work diluted."
modelmakers,37t31m,FlyingSMonster,1 point,Sat May 30 06:22:09 2015 UTC,"Days is conservative; I just know that I didn't bother getting around to draining it until a few days later, by which time it had removed the paint.   However, sounds like I should get a gallon of this stuff."
modelmakers,37t31m,windupmonkeys,1 point,Sat May 30 16:11:30 2015 UTC,I use any kind of oil I have on my brushes. I soak them in canola oil or whatever I have and it dissolves the paint. Gasoline always works too! But it might melt the plastic. I don't know if I'm helping or babbling.
modelmakers,37t31m,mindphaser,1 point,Sat May 30 13:46:01 2015 UTC,"Brake fluid works well with enamels.  Wear gloves during the process, clean the parts with soap and a toothbrush 2/3 times after you stripped the paint and dispose the fluid appropriately (:  Gasoline can melt the plastic, i'd avoid it"

modelmakers,37pwwa,frugm1,2,Fri May 29 13:48:04 2015 UTC,What did you do for the interior chipping? I'm building a B-25 too and plan on shamelessly ripping off your techniques
modelmakers,37pwwa,sleepwalker77,3,Fri May 29 23:59:41 2015 UTC,"Thank's for the comment. To create the chipping I first sprayed the interior with Aluminium. Once dried I sprayed a layer of hairspray and let this dry. Then finally I sprayed the interior Green chromate. Once this is dry you can apply plain water with a brush and let it soak in a little, after a minute or two you can take a tooth pick or blunt object and ""chip"" away the green chromate.  This works because once you apply water onto the top coat it soaks through and dissolves the hairspray, allowing you to remove the top coat easily.  unsurprisingly this is called the Hairspray chipping technique, here's a video that explains it a little better than I probably did. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7CNFdEZnQN8  I'll look forward to seeing your build. Which version are you making?"

Also if you're looking  for aftermarket decals warbirds make excellent sets for allot of the b25's.  I'm also going to go heavy with the weathering on mine. Salt spray, faded paint, chipping. Etc.  Look forward to seeing your model!  http://www.britmodeller.com/forums/index.php?/topic/57027-salt-weathering-techniques/ Here's a good tutorial I found on the techniques I'd like to use on my model.

I'll try to upload them in the next couple of days for you.  You can also find them in this album if you want, but it's a big album. 500 pictures big. And it's completely unorganized.

modelmakers,37qq4g,Saawyer,2,Fri May 29 17:13:20 2015 UTC,"The Chinese knockoffs you can find on Amazon or eBay (and pretty much anywhere else) works well as an introduction to airbrushing. They're not perfect, but for getting the hang of it and learning to use an airbrush I'd rather recommend you get something inexpensive. Although the phrase ""buy quality, cry once"" definitely applies to airbrushes.  If you want some added, and in some cases guaranteed, reliability everyone from Harder & Steenbeck to Badger have entry level airbrushes. The Iwata/Neo or the Harder Steenbeck Ultra are reliable and works well for almost any task you will come across when modelling.   Make sure to get a gravity feed (cup on top) airbrush since they're a bit easier to learn and requires less pressure from your compressor. You also don't need to invest in bottles.  Talking about the compressor, make sure you have a regulator with a moisture trap on it. You want to be able to regulate the pressure from 0-20psi (2 bar or something)."
modelmakers,37qq4g,pxpxpx,2,Fri May 29 22:22:23 2015 UTC,"I know nothing about airbrushing, but I found a small compressor (free) to use as a dedicated air source. Before reluctant because I'm compressors can be expensive, now I think all I need is the airbrush and paint and bottles and I’m ready to go. I'm looking for something that is on the cheap side, because I'm not sure if I like it. I guess it is always useful for something, so it's not a matter of poor quality. I would love to help in choosing the style (I guess there are different methods of feeding?) And I would love numbers of certain models so that you can check them online.   No bad air brushes. What you buy depends on the type of paint to be sprayed, water-based or oil, thick or thin water color, and you want a single action or double-action brush, if you want a top gravity feed, side feed, or feed siphon. In my biased opinion, Iwata air brushes are the best made you can buy. I need to use spray paint thinner model. Also I have a very old Thayer candle is made for very thin liquid. It can be used for decorating cakes or my use of paint on the exterior model railroads. If you want to paint models, as a beginner, I would recommend a Badger single action airbrush with siphon feed. If you have a bit more dexterity, a double action can control the amount of paint flow. Down controls the air flow, how far back you pull determines how much paint flows.  http://cdn.artistsupplysource.com/images/P/xctmpGeVuPT.png"
modelmakers,37qpbv,rangamatchstick,3,Fri May 29 17:08:28 2015 UTC,"For worn metal on the edges of things, I usually use a soft lead pencil. I paint it all the way up and then gently rub the pencil along corners of things to give the impression of worn-off paint and a lightly metallic surface.   Otherwise, yeah-- look for instructions on paint chipping and rust. You can do some of it with a sponge, or if you want to get fancy you can use oil paints:  http://www.missing-lynx.com/articles/other/oilpaintrenderingmr_1.html"
modelmakers,37qpbv,solipsistnation,2,Fri May 29 20:34:42 2015 UTC,The affect is called chipping. Lots of info on it out there so google will definitely be your friend. I've never really done it myself though.
modelmakers,37qpbv,FreakinfreakInfreaki,2,Fri May 29 17:32:48 2015 UTC,"Couple of ways to do this.  Most common is probably drybrushing, where you take steel/silver colored paint and wipe most of it off the brush, then use the brush against the edge you want to look worn.  Build it up in light layers.  The other is to paint the layers steel->primer->final color, and very lightly sand the edge to expose the steel color.  Bear in mind that exposed steel corrodes very quickly, so it doesn't stay shiny."
modelmakers,37qpbv,RonPossible,1 point,Fri May 29 17:37:11 2015 UTC,What about just lots of layers of the steel paint then the top coat? Dont have any primer at the moment. I know im going to put something on top to dull it abit.
modelmakers,37qpbv,RonPossible,3,Fri May 29 18:27:11 2015 UTC,"By ""primer"" I mean, in the Panther's case, the red-oxide primer applied to the tank before painting, not the primer you put on the model before painting.   So when you wear down the camo to the steel paint, there's a little bit of red color showing, just as if the spot had rubbed through both paint and primer."

I have all kinds of childhood Airfix nightmares, but their newer kits are phenomenal. They've got a new tooling system these days and they take measurements on real aircraft using a radar imprint or something. Most of the newer Airfix kits also offer recessed panel lines and some of the parts fit like a dream.

When we got married she already had a house and I really didn't have a place for my models, so a few of them were scattered on shelves and the rest were in my storage bins in the basement. She took a few and hung them up on a wall one day when I was at work (hanging them on nails with picture wire), and the idea took off from there. Then, when we built our study, she let me have a whole wall. I'm pretty much out of space at this point and slowly as the new models go up, the old one from my youth come down and either go back into storage or go on a shelf in the game room, though that's in the basement and I typically avoid having them exposed there."

I've got two more coming - preorders with Airfix for the new-tooled Defiant and Beaufighter. Then I need to stop for a while and build what I've got. I'm really excited about that Me 323, but it's gonna be big. Bigger than my XB-35. If I see something unique I really want, I tend to jump on it while I still can (if I can afford it).

The 111Z should be a lot of fun - I'll put it up on the left side wall, probably near the Lancaster. I've got a full Big Ed kit for it, so it should come out really detailed. The Me 323 luckily won't take up any wallspace - since it has fixed landing gear I'll put it on a shelf somewhere.  I did a Revell B-17 not too long ago - ""A Bit O' Lace"".

I can't afford the paints ATM, and I'm putting stuff for the Tiger I, diorama, and Fw 190 for the Eastern Front Groupbuild ahead of the B-17 in importance due to having to (if I can manage) finish them by 1 September (I wish I'd made the time longer now!). I need to buy and paint some soldiers for the diorama, some new Thinner, the paints for the Tiger (11 in total), and the Tamiya diorama textured paints. If be able to get it a bit quicker, but it's father's day next month.  Just a quick question: do you reckon 10ml of Tamiya paint will be enough to cover the entire model?  Edit: Just remembered the Spitfire I want to do for the RAF Groupbuild. I doubt I'll have the money for the paints for that :/"

I'll make sure to even have good WIP pics on it - half the Eduard kit for it is interior parts nobody will ever see again, so a WIP is a must!  I'm definitely looking forward to this Eastern Front groupbuild. If I can get to it in time I may even bang out the Pe-2. Right now I'm working on my Whirlwinds for the RAF groupbuild since it's got the earlier deadline (I'll make both deadlines with time to spare though). But the Zwilling is definitely calling out to me.   Just a quick question: do you reckon 10ml of Tamiya paint will be enough to cover the entire model?   If you're working with an airbrush, I would imagine it should be enough. If you're concerned, I will say it's better to have too much than not enough, as you may always use what's left over elsewhere. I tend to use Model Master paint in the .5-oz jars, so they're closer to 15ml but I've always got plenty left over."

I've finished all of the painting of the model before decals, however i've already peeled the masking of the canopy. My question is should i apply pledge/future before decals still? If so, how about should i apply it to the unmasked canopy?"
modelmakers,37q6pa,pxpxpx,2,Fri May 29 15:19:52 2015 UTC,"I'd carefully mask the canopy again.   Humbrol Maskol or any latex-based masking agent helps especially if the ribs/frame is raised.   The problem, as I see it, is that if you just tape up the canopy to protect the glass you will get a difference in top coat. It might look weird, it might look perfectly fine. YMMV. :)  I'd just mutter to myself that learning has occurred and carefully mask it up again."
modelmakers,37q6pa,SnarkMasterRay,2,Fri May 29 20:23:30 2015 UTC,"Either re-mask the canopy, pull it off (assuming you can), or only gloss coat selected areas. I would rank them in that order. Remasking, if the paints are flat, doesn't have to be exact. You can mask out to a certain pane line instead, for example, maybe just the frame. if you only gloss coat the areas you do the decals on, you might have a slightly different finish appearance when you flat coat."

modelmakers,37q6pa,flounderflound,2,Fri May 29 23:02:37 2015 UTC,Thanks!
modelmakers,37q6pa,pxpxpx,2,Fri May 29 23:51:03 2015 UTC,"Depending on what effect you're after both have their benefits (and they can of course be combined).   Salt chipping, the way I've done it at least, produces a more harsh and localised chipping. The hairspray technique is a bit more controlled and you have a bit more control over how the chipping will look.   The idea is that you put on a layer of hairspray or other water soluble liquid that acts as a barrier between the basecoat and the the top layer.   You the brush on some warm water and wait a minute. The water will then permeate through the top coat (water based acrylic is usually the best option) and re-activate the hairspray. So you can chip it off with a stiff brush or any other object that don't mar the finish underneath.   Salt chipping works the same way, you just add table salt and then when dry a bit of water loosens it from the base coat and you can brush it off. Creating a very random effect. It's less control, but makes it much quicker and easier to create a finish that looks like it's been through a hailstorm.  Let me know if I just made things more confusing. :)"
modelmakers,37q6pa,flounderflound,2,Fri May 29 21:47:39 2015 UTC,"So basically with the hairspray technique you're spraying it over the paint and once adding the water and letting it set in a little, you chip the paint off, is that right?  As for the salt chipping - do you just loosely put on the salt or do you adhere it in some way? Sorry if I sound like a moron here."
modelmakers,37q6pa,pxpxpx,3,Fri May 29 22:04:23 2015 UTC,"Yes. I do it in this order   basecoat -> sealant -> hairspray -> topcoat -> water/chipping  When I've done the salt technique (on Warhammer 40K stuff mostly since I found it a bit too dramatic for scale models) I've adhered it with hairspray. When the hairspray is still wet you sprinkle on the salt.   The top coat wont come off unless you put some work on it, so you can add water, remove as much top coat (or rub off the salt granules) as you want. Then when done, you just put a layer of sealant (gloss or satin clear coat) to make it more or less permanent."
modelmakers,37q6pa,flounderflound,3,Fri May 29 22:10:05 2015 UTC,"By the coats, I assume basecoat=aluminum/steel/metal of some type, top coat=paint, correct?"
modelmakers,37q6pa,XenophonTheAthenian,2,Fri May 29 23:56:51 2015 UTC,"Not necessarily. Most vehicles, both aircraft and armor, use a primer. On US aircraft, for example, it was this yellow zinc chromate primer. On German armor it was the well-known (and often discussed by rivet-countera, for some reason) red oxide primer. These primers were mostly to protect the metal underneath from corrosion, and you'd see primer before bare metal--besides, bare metal would also start to rust if exposed (at the very least it'd get dulled by corrosion--most armor chipping is done with a different shade of the base coat, rather than full-on bare metal, because the hull's bare metal corrodes pretty quickly and turns sort of darkish)"
modelmakers,37q6pa,pxpxpx,1 point,Sat May 30 06:35:25 2015 UTC,"Yes, in your case (aircraft) that would be correct. In my case it's usually some sort of ""german hull red"" :)"
modelmakers,37q6pa,Destructias_Warlord,3,Sat May 30 12:23:35 2015 UTC,Use water. It melts the salt a bit so that it sticks to the model. I airbrush the water on to give a fine coat then sprinkle the salt. Wait for the water to dry before painting. Then brush off the salt with a toothbrush. The salt leaves some white residue but this will go away once you spray on a clear coat.
modelmakers,37q6pa,flounderflound,1 point,Fri May 29 22:46:38 2015 UTC,"Oh, so you put the salt on before you paint? That actually makes a lot of sense."

modelmakers,37q6pa,ionizzatore,1 point,Sat May 30 13:50:53 2015 UTC,"A white semi-transaprent sheet of paper?  It's there to protect the decals from scratching with the sprues, you can throw it away"
modelmakers,37l4mo,LJIGaming,4,Thu May 28 12:40:04 2015 UTC,Hey from the pictures it looks like it turned out great.
modelmakers,37l4mo,EM2Hero,4,Thu May 28 16:16:20 2015 UTC,"I think it looks good the way it is, no weathering required. You do need to add yellow propeller tips (unless you've looked into it and discovered that this particular aircraft didn't have them). Weathering really is a process, not a finishing step. If the model is to look weathered, you need to (IMO) have this in mind before you add paint. Weathering is built up in layers. All I generally do is (sometimes) pre-shading, then the base color, then a post-fade or post-shade where I spray a lightened version of the base color in the centres of panels or along panel lines, then decals, then a wash of some sort. Other modelers have far more elaborate processes that looks much more realistic than what I do, but the weathering process is always thought of as layers. I think if you added weathering to the model now, it would not look integrated into your model's finish. It would look like a bunch of streaks and shades sitting on top of an already finished model, so I'd just leave this one clean. Take this with a grain of salt, though. There aren't really any hard rules and what works for me won't work for everybody so this is just my opinion.  The off-stance of the model might be caused by incorrect wing dihedral as well. Each wing is supposed to have a slight upwards angle and this of course has to be equal on both sides. The landing gear could be wrong and the dihedral could be wrong simultaneously. Just something you have to look out for during basic construction. During construction, if you can sit the model down so its horizontal, or y-axis is parallel with the ground, you can measure the distance from each wingtip to the ground and ensure that these measurements are equal through making whatever adjustments you need to while the glue is setting. That way, you've got correct dihedral.  The canopy looks a little cloudy, I'm not sure why. It's not fogged like it would be if you used plastic cement to attach it, it almost looks like you've sprayed a flat coat over it. If you didn't, then consider dipping your clear parts in Future floor wax next time, that will enhance the clarity. Maybe it's just something up with the photograph.  The fin flash marking on the tail needs touching up on the tail's leading edge. Just get a fine brush and some red and white paint and ""join"" the red and white parts of the decal so it looks like one contiguous marking.  Stretched sprue is great to use for aerial wires but next time stretch the sprue as finely as you can, it's important that this detail looks as ""in scale"" as you can get it.  Great job on the decals, you've got those settled down well. In the photo where you said one of the decals broke into 6 pieces, I have no idea which particular marking you're talking about, so good job getting it back together! The basic paint work looks good and clean too.  Looks like you're the first to finish for the RAF Groupbuild so congratulations on that, I'll have my 1/72 P-40 done in about 3 weeks, school is very demanding of my time right now as I'm on the home stretch of finishing up my masters thesis."
modelmakers,37l4mo,MMGeoff,2,Thu May 28 16:23:55 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your comments!  The canopy went cloudy when I sprayed the satin varnish, and I actually did dip the canopy in future beforehand. I wasn't really expecting it, I think I'll leave the canopies off until completely finished next time.  I stretched about 5 different sprues thinner than the one on the model, but each one snapped or got pulled off so I opted for a thinner one.  The decal that split was the squadron code! If you look closely at the top of the O, you can see one of the cracks.  If I get my Lancaster finished before the deadline, I may enter that in too."
modelmakers,37l4mo,MMGeoff,1 point,Thu May 28 17:17:47 2015 UTC,"Well that explains the canopy. Clear surfaces have to be protected somehow when you're spraying clear coats. I leave the masking on until the model is 99.9% finished. Removing the canopy masking is usually the second last thing I do. Leaving the canopy off until last runs the risk of not getting a good fitting on your canopy. A lot of new kits have clear parts that fit very nicely but you can't always trust the manufacturer. Sometimes you'll have to add the canopy before the painting stage so you can fill any gaps and address any fit problems before committing paint. But of course, leaving the canopy off, if you can, will prevent this fogging from happening again.  Another tip, when you're spraying clear varnishes, be they flat, satin or gloss, spray them on so they look ""wet"" when applied. Don't apply really thin dusty coats because it gives you a rough finish. This applies to all paint application, actually. There's a feel to it and it takes a bit of practice but a smooth, even finish adds a lot to a model.  I'd love to see a Lancaster in the RAF groupbuild, get your ass in gear!  EDIT: And about the antennae, they're just a pain in the ass no matter what, but they're an important detail that adds a certain delicateness and finesse to a model, like rigging on a biplane. You need to strive for as thin of a line as you can get. Attach it with tiny drops of superglue, and just take your time. Attach one end, let it dry completely, and then attach the antenna at the other end. If you don't have some, invest in some superglue accelerator and apply small amounts of this with a fine brush to help the superglue dry much, much faster. Don't use the spray-bottle function, it's far too imprecise and accelerator can damage paint."

modelmakers,37lzlf,Kozzybear,3,Thu May 28 16:25:54 2015 UTC,"Yes it is defiantly true weathering can be easily over done.  Ask yourself these questions. How realistic do I want the model to look? Or and I just doing an over all general look?  If you are going for life like/ copying real world prototypes, the yes defiantly reference pictures are the way to go, research what you are building and where it was used will all come into play when deciding how far you go.  Some people go for more an aesthetically pleasing look than realistic look. For example, pin washed panel lines 1/72 scale even 1/48 scale would in reality be almost invisible, however some people like to shade/ pin wash them just for aesthetic purposes.  First off Subtlety is defiantly key on a good weathering job.  I always do my washes over a gloss coat so that the washes will flow easier, also if it is too heavy you can always take it off.  There are a lot of ""weathering products"" available. I'm going to tell you right off the bat, don't waste your money on them. I few colors of oil paint, some hard pastel chalks are all you need. Half the price and will last you 1000 times longer.  For me personally weathering is one of the most exciting parts of making the model, anyone can spray on a few colors make it look like has just come out of a factory, and hey that's fine if you want that look, but to really pull out a models true potential it has to be weathered.  Lastly and most importantly, unless you plan on entering any competitions. Always remember you are modeling for yourself and no one else. If you are happy with how it looks that's all that matters!  Good luck! If you have any questions feel free to ask."

modelmakers,37lzlf,Patman64,3,Thu May 28 23:30:54 2015 UTC,"Go slow. Take an hour between steps to get some perspective. Being focussed in on weathering means you think what you are doing looks good until you pull back and realize it looks like garbage.  Less is way way way way more. Seriously.  Learn what terrain a vehicle would encounter and base your weathering off that. A vehicle meant for the desert shouldn't have a bunch of caked on mud. Desert mud is a different consistency to jungle, deciduous forest, or plains mud. References, like you said. Learn some weathering techniques from more experienced builders   This should be a good starting point."

TO do this dip your brush into paint (silver to show some chipping on metal surfaces) and paint on a paper or towel until there is no more coming off of the brush onto the paper, hence why it is called dry brushing as the brush is mostly dry. Then using the pictures you brought up, see where the most wear is and take your brush and lightly paint over, careful not to go to overboard."
modelmakers,37l0u8,alaskafish,9,Thu May 28 12:03:41 2015 UTC,"No. Spraying with oddly enough increase odds of an uneven finish. Usually, canopies are dipped/soaked in it and left to dry BEFORE you mask and paint.   No to the second. That will defeat the entire purpose of the future coating. The order is more like this:    Soak in future.  Mask, paint.  Leave mask on, matt coat.  Remove masks."

modelmakers,37l0u8,Dr_Von_Spaceman,4,Fri May 29 04:39:49 2015 UTC,I going to go with no. You can place the canopy any time you like during the build but don't spray clear/matte after you've removed the masks.

modelmakers,37k80l,solipsistnation,1 point,Thu May 28 15:17:11 2015 UTC,"As i and solipsistnation said, Dragon kits are not for beginners.  Dragon kits are usually over-engeneered, the instructions are cramped and not always clear, the kit itself is expensive and, unless you are particularly gifted, you are going to mess something up in your very first builds (don't worry, it happens to everyone).  We suggest you to chose the Tamiya model: it's cheaper, easier to build and it's better than the majority of the kits out there (italeri, academy, ...)."
modelmakers,37k80l,windupmonkeys,3,Thu May 28 16:08:11 2015 UTC,"Alright, I guess I'm going Tamiya, thanks dudes"
modelmakers,37k80l,yawningangel,1 point,Thu May 28 16:13:53 2015 UTC,"Yeah, if this is your first build, maybe don't even build a Tiger-- build something you like but not your favorite thing, so you can mess it up and figure out how stuff works. Then you won't do anything weird with your favorite tank and get discouraged and not bother finishing it."
modelmakers,37k80l,solipsistnation,1 point,Thu May 28 22:04:25 2015 UTC,"Or, not a late model. Go with an early, panzer gray-only color. Those camo schemes and zimmerit coatings are notoriously difficult to do well, particularly for beginners.   Some Tiger Is were painted in plain panzer gray, with no zimmerit. That's the one you'd want to build. If you want to get a feel for the experience, buy a smaller, say 1/72 scale Tiger I and see if you can handle that kit.   People who try to build their ""favorite"" vehicle on their first build, as stated multiple times here, tend to be disappointed by the result. Most people think modelmaking is so easy, blah blah, it won't happen to me, it's just fitting parts together. It is, and it also isn't.   Dragon kits are definitely not for beginners. When they say ""overengineered,"" they're politely saying that Dragon kits use five parts when one will do, and use tiny, tiny parts that are hard to handle, easy to break, easy to lose, etc. For example, Dragon kits often include separate-link tracks, where you have to assemble the catepillar tracks by hand, one link at a time. Some people who like building like that (because it's more ""realistic""), and other people find it boring as watching paint dry.   If you want to get a feel for what modelmaking is like, get a Tamiya Panzer III, which is cheap (less than 15 dollars), and which is easy to build, but teaches you the fundamentals. It's painted in Panzer Gray, has some decals  for you to apply, some figurines to play with and learn to paint.   If you can't assemble that model properly or get a result you're satisfied with, two things. (1) you'll be happy your first model wasnt a Tiger I, and (2) you'll figure out that just because it seems simple, like many things, it doesn't mean that it's a no-skill proposition."

modelmakers,37keya,Plundersquirrel,3,Thu May 28 08:25:35 2015 UTC,"No ;) ok nice, I look forward to that.  Transfers are found on that sheet of paper in the box with all the things like the Nasa  symbol etc. on. See if you can find the little sheet of paper, smaller than A5, that'll be in there. You cut out with scissors or a knife around whichever decal (another more common name for transfers) you're going to put on, and leave it in water for a little while (30-90 seconds), and then slide (transfer) it onto the position you need it to be in. Something soft to slide it off without ripping it would be useful. You paint Ti model before doing this.  I hope I described that right :/  And sometimes leaving the pieces in warm water for a while removes a top layer of plastic from the pieces which allows for easier glueing and for the paint to stay on the surface easier."
modelmakers,37keya,Plundersquirrel,2,Thu May 28 08:48:48 2015 UTC,"Thanks! I get it now.  And I can use water as a thinner if I buy acrylics, right? I don't need another paint thinner. Just a brush, acrylics and water."

modelmakers,37keya,Plundersquirrel,1 point,Thu May 28 11:03:53 2015 UTC,"The problem with using alcohol or any of the thinners other than water when brush painting, is that the thinner/alcohol will tend to lift/dissolve any underlying paint layers. This is one of the reasons that Tamiya is not that great for brush painting. The high solvent content dissolves the layer below...This is GOOD for airbrush because it allows the layers to bond to each other, but not so good for brush...  Water doesn't have that problem, because when acrylic dries, it is a waterproof film."

Hope it meets the criteria.  A few years ago, I was building a Dragon 1/350 submarine, the Los Angeles if I recall correctly.  Lots of small, breakable antennas and snorkels.  Not the sort of thing you want to drop.  So I'm holding the almost-finished sub in my right hand, and trimming away something (excess glue probably) with a knife in my left.  The knife was an Xacto, round metal barrel, new #11 blade.  I put the knife down, and a few seconds later see  out of the corner of my eye something roll off the desk. Maybe a snorkel.  Being male, I instinctively bring my legs together to catch the part before it's lost in the carpet.  Well, this is where I FU'd and dropped the sub, breaking off various bits.  Damn.    When I say ""bring my legs together"" it was more of a ""slam them together"".  Such are my ninja-like reflexes, I caught the aforementioned Xacto knife as it was parallel between my thighs.  Sub does an emergency blow and flies out of my hand.  End result, #11 blade and 1/4"" of the handle buried  in my right thigh.  Immediate thoughts of war movies and severing a femoral artery, but luckily(?) just slashed muscle.  By the time my wife got me to the local GP for a couple of stitches, everything groin to knee was bright yellow, and I couldn't walk for a while.  Damn if it didn't hurt too.  Of course, I'd picked up the sub before being medevaced out (priorities, right?) but all protrusions were snapped off.  I think it hit the wall on the way down.  Never could bring myself to fix it :-(  Since then, I've always put knives and sharp things down carefully...  TL;DR - great reflexes causes stab wound to the leg and loss of submarine"

I could easily strip and start from square one, but by this point I'm happy to throw up my hands and use it as a painting guinea pig."
modelmakers,37fasy,Ghoda,2,Wed May 27 05:53:50 2015 UTC,"Welp, since I named the event I might as well participate in it :)  After several failed attempts to mask the canopy on a Revell BF-109 to my satisfaction I decided to give Micro Mask a try. It went on well enough and trimming the excess wasn't too bad - I only wish it went on opaque to make it easier to see where the mask already was placed but whatever. Mask is on, prime, painted, all is looking good. Masked off and painted the black portions and didn't realize when I pulled the tape off it took the top portion of the Micro Masking on the canopy with it. Laid down my protective clear coat to start on the decalling and final assembly.  Now the pilot has a pimped out BF 109 with a custom frosted top pane on the canopy  Bonus TIFU - the underside is supposed to be sky blue but little to my knowledge the Tamiya Light Blue is actually a bit green in the bottle due to Tamiya using a yellow thinner/suspension fluid. Had some Testors Blue laying around and thought it would blue it up real nice. The Testors bonded to the yellow thinner and now the bottom is irrevocably green :S"

Of course, as I'm maneuvering the turret around to paint it, it slips from my hand.  Immediate instinct is to catch it with my right hand... which is holding my airbrush, full of paint.  Next thing I know the turret's on the floor, missing pieces with paint splattered all over it, and there's a huge vomit stain of paint across my desk, leg, hand, and airbrush.  Sigh.  Good news is, the turret was repairable and the hairspray underneath the base coat allowed me to just wash off the splattered paint.  I'm hoping to get back at it tonight to finish off the base coats and camouflage.  My other favorite fuck up is gluing the rear armor plate & exhaust system upside down on a Panzer III.  Didn't realize it till weeks after the build was done and painted. o_0"

I either put it in another model kit box or it somehow got thrown out.  I had started it when I was younger, one of the first 'difficult'/more in depth kits my father got me, but I sorta just pushed it aside after doing some work on it.  Come a few years later and getting back into building model kits, I choose the RF-4E to reignite the spark for building, well, there I sat looking everything over and the clear parts were missing. So now it just sits in the stash waiting for me to figure out what to do with it.  Something I still laugh at myself for, is gluing shut the turret of a 1/72nd Tiger I way back when... ha."
modelmakers,37fasy,Destructias_Warlord,1 point,Thu May 28 03:09:33 2015 UTC,I think you could request an extra sprue from Revell. Some brands give a spare spure if you contact them.

modelmakers,37fasy,MMGeoff,1 point,Thu May 28 16:36:31 2015 UTC,"Yesterday I fucked up my 1/72 A6M5 Zero by being in too much of a rush applying decals. One of the national insignias on the underside developed a big fold in it, so I stabbed it a bunch with an x-acto blade and bombarded it with setting solution, so far it is not settling down. I might have to remove it and replace it with another decal, fortunately I have a sheet of spare Japanese insignias.  I ruined the squadron codes on the tail as well. I applied setting solution and accidentally knocked the code out of position, and I had to start trying to move it back into place with a brush. The decal adhesive was starting to do its thing as was the setting solution, and little shards of the decal started coming off. I removed both squadron codes and will have to replace them with the codes from one of the other decal options from the kit. Not a big deal, but I don't like fictitious markings, as this model will bear markings from two separate aircraft. Oh well. I could always just remove some more markings, do some touch ups, repaint the propeller/spinner and just convert the model into option 'B' from the kit. I'll probably do that."
modelmakers,37gs4u,Dundun-dun-dudun,3,Wed May 27 14:54:58 2015 UTC,"Its probably a good idea to see what paint it requires when you get the model itself, or you can look online and see what colors it needs. It will make it easier to paint if they're on the sprue, but if you want you can do them while holding it in your hand. It usually turns out best if you paint as you go as well."
modelmakers,37gs4u,Commanderfox515,3,Wed May 27 16:21:32 2015 UTC,"When painting models, I usually read through the instructions to determine when different parts are painted. For example, I usually paint smaller parts (such as those in a cockpit) first and then glue, but I usually paint the hull after it is assembled. I also reccomend painting the hull before you add landing gear or bombs/rockets. For armor, I tend to spray every part with the main color, and then I re-paint any parts that are not meant to be the main color. I hope this helps."
modelmakers,37gs4u,Abe-Mango,3,Wed May 27 18:01:07 2015 UTC,"The cement works best on non-painted surfaces.  I usually assemble as much as I can and still get to everything that needs painted.  So for aircraft I'll assemble the cockpit minus the pilot and sometimes the seat. Paint the cockpit assembly, seat, pilot and the inside of the fuselage.  Then I assemble the rest of the model sans ordnance, landing gear and sometimes canopy (if it's going to be left open).  Then do final paint and decals and clearcoat.  Ordnance and landing gear usually get painted and attached last.  Edit:  General rule of thumb - If two parts will be painted the same color, and one won't block painting the other, go ahead and glue them together first."
modelmakers,37gs4u,RonPossible,2,Wed May 27 20:56:27 2015 UTC,I bought an Airfix 1/72 Messerschmitt Bf 109 G-6.  whats the difference between acrylic and enamel paints? which is best to use?
modelmakers,37gs4u,Abe-Mango,2,Wed May 27 22:46:33 2015 UTC,"As far as I am aware, not too much. Acrylics dry faster and can be thinned with rubbing alcohol or tamiya thinners. Enamels must be thinned with turpentine or white spirit. All enamels are toxic, while most acrylics aren't. If you are airbrushing, USE ACRYLICS, they make it easier to clean your airbrush afterwards. The only reasons to use enamels are that there are more colors available and enamels used to be the only option, so older kits may encourage their use.  TL;DR it's probably best to use Tamiya brand acrylics."
modelmakers,37gs4u,ionizzatore,2,Thu May 28 00:44:58 2015 UTC,"I'd suggest Vallejo for brush painting and Tamiya/Gunze for airbrushing.  Remember that vallejo cannot be thinned/cleaned with alcohol, you should avoid vallejo+alcohol mix at all cost and since Tamiya/Gunze are alcohol-based you cannot mix them, even if both are marked as ""acrylic"""
modelmakers,37gs4u,frugm1,2,Thu May 28 07:49:00 2015 UTC,"You can thin with windex, my personal preference is future, gives the paint a nice satin finish and is also less watery than windex. I do use windex to clean my airbrush afterwards though. Although this practice is not recommended, I just do it for convenience, so far haven't had any issues."
modelmakers,37gs4u,ionizzatore,2,Sun May 31 17:13:41 2015 UTC,"What is not recommended is to let the windex sit too much time in the airbrush, it can ruin the chrome finish"

modelmakers,37gs4u,ionizzatore,1 point,Thu May 28 17:27:33 2015 UTC,"Water, Windex®, Vallejo's thinner.  I prefer to use Vallejo's ""Airbrush thinner"", it helps the paint to flow, but you can use regular tap water"
modelmakers,37gs4u,Fradra,1 point,Thu May 28 18:17:01 2015 UTC,"aha, I've had success with airbrush cleaner as well."
modelmakers,37gs4u,windupmonkeys,2,Thu May 28 20:35:12 2015 UTC,"Enamels use an oil based carrier, which requires the use of the above mentioned thinners. It's disfavored among some because it's comparatively toxic, smelly, and requires special thinners to clean the brushes with (white spirit, proprietary thinner, etc). I stay away because I hate the smell. Some swear by it for brush painting because of favorable working properties.  Acrylics vary in formulation, but have some advantages depending on which brand you use.   Model Master Acrylic: good for brushing, water cleanup and thinning, but only if you use a non-acrylic primer underneath or it will lift when you try to mask it.   Vallejo: not sure what all the fuss is about, frankly, that paint doesn't seem to cover very well.  However, it does NOT thin with alcohol, it'll turn into a gloppy, useless mess. Water or their proprietary thinner (if any) is best.   Humbrol Acrylic: also, again, use water or their branded thinner. Alcohol will react with it and turn it into glop.   Tamiya Acrylic: a distinctly different formulation from all of the above. It's not good for using with a paintbrush, and is designed to be sprayed (which it does very well). Strippable and thinnable with 91% iso alcohol.   Build and paint order:   Use common sense. Which parts would be VERY hard to paint if they were already installed? Which parts would become effectively inaccessible? Paint those, then. Pilot you can still paint on the sprue and touch up the sprue attachment point where you cut it off later, whereas the idea of painting the pilot's uniform in the cockpit makes no sense. Also, sometimes having the part on the sprue makes it far easier because it provides a convenient holder of the part to move around while you paint it."
modelmakers,37gs4u,windupmonkeys,1 point,Thu May 28 12:55:39 2015 UTC,On the box of the model I bought it had a list of paints to use from humbrol are the paints numbered the same across the brands or do I have to go through a list from whatever brand I'm looking at and matching the colors?  I feel like I'll get far better results using an airbrush then with painting brushes but either way I'll try both to see what I might be more comfortable with.  Any recommendations for a beginner single action airbrush?
modelmakers,37gs4u,RonPossible,1 point,Thu May 28 16:21:29 2015 UTC,"Fair enough, but honestly, you still need to know how to brush paint. For many of the smaller parts, it's not worth the bother or the hassle to load and airbrush and clean it to spray it.   No, they absolutely are NOT labelled the same. Each company (aside from the Chinese companies) provides color callouts for their favored (usually in-house or own-brand) paint. You will need to find a conversion table/charter if you want a match, and in some cases, one color that is available in one range of paint is not available in another or requires mixing. See the sidebar where it lists ""USEFUL TOOLS"" where it has color converters and model paint database.   The list from humbrol is their own range of paint, of which it is available in either Acrylic or Enamel. Humbrol enamel is supposed to be pretty good to work with, but my experience with their acrylic paint was disappointing to say the least.   Sometimes names are shared across brand lines, e.g. ""panzer gray"" = ""german gray"" = something else.   For future reference, companies with proprietary paint lines (and accordingly, recommend them in their paint callouts are):   Airfix: Humbrol paints.  Tamiya: Tamiya acrylic or enamel paints (acrylic is much easier to find, at least in the US).  Revel: Revel Aqua Color or Revell Color or something like that. Itaerli: previously, their callouts were in Model Master Acrylic/Enamel paint colors and FS numbers, today, they have their own range of paint.  Trumpeter, Hobby Boss, etc: it really depends on the kit. sometimes they'll provide Gunze Sangyo conversions, Tamiya, and Model Master. Other times, they don't provide one or the other. They do not manufacture paint so they provide paint colors for other brands.   FS Number: you may see this in your instruction sheets, e.g. ""Aircraft Gray, FS (five digit or similar number)."" That's  a useful reference because it provides the Federal Standard color, which some manufacturers (particularly Model Master by Testors) seeks to emulate. Vallejo, AK, and MiG might also do that."
modelmakers,37e1uu,mindphaser,8,Tue May 26 23:11:07 2015 UTC,"That Monogram tank kit is a trap. Seriously, they should be embarassed still selling it. It looks like you got it together about as well as could be done. 8)  If you're looking for a better starter kit, check Tamiya's under-$20 kits. They're typically quite good.   Decals can be touchy, especially over a matte surface. You really need a glossy surface for them to adhere well, and even then they'll be pretty fragile until you seal over them. If you're going to use hobby store spraycans, check out Testor's Glosscote and Dullcote-- a can of each should hold you for most purposes for 3 or 4 kits worth of building.   I built a Tamiya Panzer II (one of their cheap kits) and documented a bunch of stuff for beginners. Here are the first 3 parts, which should cover the stuff you've been wondering about:  http://imgur.com/a/uLo6g  http://imgur.com/a/KrPnU  Part 3 has decals:  http://imgur.com/a/eUbHm  So with these kits, what you have may not be great, but they're perfect for trying out techniques and painting and repainting and stuff. And hey, you got them together! If you can get a poorly-designed Monogram kit from the dark ages built, you can definitely pull off a newer kit. Maybe build a couple of Tamiya or Italeri tanks before going for Trumpeter or Meng, but you've got a good start there.  Anyway, it's a good start. What do you want to do next?"

modelmakers,37e1uu,Brickie78,2,Tue May 26 23:54:18 2015 UTC,"To get the hang of it, I'd suggest asking around for some suggestions of what you might call ""shake and bake"" kits - ones that are well-engineered and go together easily, which will help you get a feel for it, as well obviously as giving you a confidence boost!  Here in the UK, the ""default"" manufacturer is Airfix and after a few years in the doldrums they've come out with some real crackers over the past few years, many of them in the ""pocket money"" range. Certainly most of the major names like Spitfire, 109, 190, Hurricane, Zero have been given beautiful renderings in 1/72 scale for under £10, and several in the bigger scales as well."
modelmakers,37e1uu,vonshaunus,2,Wed May 27 08:29:30 2015 UTC,"Airbrushing is a tricky business at first.. EXACTLY what you describe happens to everyone.  Big tip.. lots and lots of light. more light. brighter. more of it. If you cant see it you cant airbrush it. add another lamp or set up with a window behind you.  Second tip, primer is everything. Use tamiya rattle-can primer, well shaken, at first, it goes on so easy and covers beautifully and paint will then be easy to apply and see.  Third tip always always apply a varnish before decals. if you dont want to varnish the whole thing then just paint a thin coat of something like vallejo satin varnish over the area the decal will go on and let it dry, then decal.. then you can later apply a varnish over the whole model. I favour testors dullcote for armour models.  fourth tip, get a cheap pair of sprue-cutters, then use a very sharp hobby knife to scrape away the last stub of the mounting point, then a fine sanding stick if needed to finish.  fifth tip.. use the right glue. I use tamiya bottle standard glue for big parts and tamiya extra-thin for small parts, and CA glue for non plastic parts."

Hasegawa and academy seem to get underrepresented, but for 1/72 scale, they probably have the best price to quality ratio. Tamiya 1/72 kits are good as well, but they can be a bit more expensive. Italeri and Zvezda are good as well, but I've only made one of each. Revell, AMT, and monogram should really not be bothered with for 1/72. Their bigger kits are good, but the smaller ones aren't worth the frustration of building."

Start masking the canopies with tape, you just can't hand paint them and make them look any good.  Work on your basic skills like filling gaps and correct your painting mistakes when you make them.

modelmakers,37cqep,R1CHARDCRANIUM,6,Tue May 26 17:49:47 2015 UTC,"You could think about it this way: unless you're going to put the plane on a string and have it swinging around your room, any depiction of the plane ""in flight"" is still going to be motionless. In that case, the propeller (though technically spinning) will also appear motionless.   Think of a plane in flight frozen in time, or a perfect photograph of an airplane in flight taken by a camera with a very fast shutter speed.   My point here is that, to me, unless you're going to have the plane actually moving (as part of a mobile or something) then prop-spin seems odd. Why is the prop spinning if the plane isn't moving? A perfectly captured time-slice of even a moving plan would mean a prop that appears still.   This of course doesn't solve your problem so much as let you think your way out of it, so it might not be what you're looking for. But to me, a motionless prop does not preclude a plane from being ""in flight."""

modelmakers,37cqep,Dr_Von_Spaceman,3,Thu May 28 01:29:59 2015 UTC,"In support of my opinion below that removing the prop blades altogether is the way to go, here are three models I built a couple of years ago. Food for thought.  Airfix 1/72 P-51 Mustang  Frog 1/72 F4U Corsair  Airfix 1/72 TBM Avenger  (Please forgive the quick and dirty photo job with lousy lighting)."
modelmakers,37cqep,Dr_Von_Spaceman,1 point,Wed May 27 04:29:31 2015 UTC,I think the Corsair and Avenger would look even more realistic if you sanded down the hub to represent the gaussian blur of the spin.
modelmakers,37cqep,FlyingLowSH,2,Thu May 28 16:52:41 2015 UTC,"What scale are you building?    One option is to make the propeller actually spin. This is the inside of a Fujimi Ju-87 in 1/72 scale I made a while ago. It has internal batteries, so once they're done, there's no way back. Currently I'm working on a concept with an F4U aswell, also in 1:72 scale. If it works how I imagine it, it will be possible to load the battery while it's resting on a special base plate.    If you, or someone who you know, is good with electronics, this is a possible way to go. Also, the larger the scale, the easier it will get to electrify it."

modelmakers,3796xw,MMGeoff,3,Mon May 25 22:11:43 2015 UTC,"I'm actually not happy with this one. It was going extremely well until I applied a wash to the panel lines. I used artist oils diluted with a Model Master brand of enamel thinner. This ate right through the acrylic gloss coat and into the acrylic paints, causing some damage. I should have used mineral spirits instead.  Then, I sort of wrecked things a bit further by applying paint chipping - just not happy with how it came out.  Expect a ""re-do"" of this exact aircraft soon, I picked up Airfix's new 1/72 Bf109 E7 the other day and I expect to start it probably sometime next month."
modelmakers,3796xw,gabeh2000,2,Mon May 25 22:14:49 2015 UTC,I can't see anything wrong with it. This looks like a museum quality model. Great job.
modelmakers,3796xw,alaskafish,2,Tue May 26 00:46:54 2015 UTC,"There's some paint damage on the underside that I had to cover up with weathering. From a foot back the model looks fine but up close I know where the mistakes are, and given how well it was turning out up until I made a dumb error with using the wrong thinner to make a wash, I just wasn't happy with myself after I messed things up a bit.   To do paint chipping I used a lighter shade of the sand brown color and I think I overdid it and it looks out of place. Basically, it's a failed weathering effort but it was looking great before that. I'm doing it over again for sure."
modelmakers,3796xw,TAWspecial,2,Tue May 26 02:00:11 2015 UTC,What color for the panel line did you use?
modelmakers,3796xw,llordlloyd,1 point,Tue May 26 10:48:06 2015 UTC,I think it's a mix of black and burnt umber artist oils.

modelmakers,3796xw,Boolit_Tooth_Tony,2,Tue May 26 00:41:27 2015 UTC,"I had a stroke of luck with it I think. I removed the crown cap on my airbrush and that altered the spray pattern in a favorable way - I was spraying lines that were about pen-thickness. I don't remember how thin I had the paint nor my pressure settings, but removing the crown cap was most of it. I used Gunze acrylics which are, to date the best paint I've sprayed."
modelmakers,3796xw,doubleDoo,2,Tue May 26 01:54:11 2015 UTC,"You might not be happy with the weathering but 1) it looks good, especially for a desert '109 and 2) you used restraint, so the level of weathering is excellent even if you're not totally pleased with the result.  I mostly use a silver pencil (Prismacolor) for chipping.  It's a great model in almost all aspects, but I am most impressed with the antenna.... I just can't make them look that realistic."
modelmakers,3796xw,ionizzatore,1 point,Tue May 26 09:30:48 2015 UTC,"Thank you. I guess it really isn't that bad, but I just can't let myself get away with the stupid mistake I made. And yeah, I try not to over-weather. Some aircraft really do get absolutely beaten to hell and filthy but it's sort of beyond my finishing style at the moment.  I have a silver pencil too but I've been finding it doesn't mark the model's surface very well and it comes off looking like glitter. I just use a fine brush with paint to do chipping, if I do any at all. I've had good luck lately with a small piece of sponge for a nice randomized effect that I might try again.  The antenna is clear stretched sprue with little dabs of white glue to simulate the insulators. Antennae are hard, I probably broke that one off 3 or 4 times before I got it on right.  I've got my sights set on that Airfix kit, expect to see ""Black 8: 2.0"" sometime in June or July."
modelmakers,3796xw,SecondhandUsername,1 point,Tue May 26 21:10:43 2015 UTC,"I look forward to it.   I find the silver pencil works best in combination with a small, very sharp brush loaded with good silver enamel paint (Tamiya enamel is nice, Humbrol otherwise). I stroke/drag the brush down panel lines (a little at a time) around cowlings, ammo panels and cockpit framing. Then use the silver pencil (again sharp) to add a few very small 'scrapes'.  The Zvezda 109F is also a nice and cheap kit, don't be put off by the fact it's 'snap together', it's a proper model."

My girlfriend like dioramas and other hobbys like customizing dolls so she was interested doing something like this with me. We split the work like taking turns applying the different layers of paint and for example I painted the panels of the cockpit while she painted the seat and made the belts. And my girlfriend have more skill gluing very small parts but I have more skills painting small parts so we split things like that.

Also I love the case you made for it"
modelmakers,379sns,JohnBox93,2,Tue May 26 05:08:22 2015 UTC,"This. The underside is ok, the upper part is weathered too heavily. The strikes are too defined and they look like leaks and not like exhaust stains.  And an oil leak would follow the flow of the air or at least go downward, it would not climb over the nose of the plane"

modelmakers,37c1td,InUrFridge,1 point,Tue May 26 14:59:15 2015 UTC,"I've used Metalcote on some aircraft. It's fairly durable, but you will lose some lustre with clear coats. Gloss clear coats are not too bad, for tank tracks, probably acceptable. Flat clear coats really dull it off and ruin it.  Testors make a 'Metalizer Sealer' that works quite well.  I left my Metalcote unvarnished and did some light weathering with airbrush post-shading.  Bear in mind not much of a tank is shiny metal, perhaps just the parts of the tracks that contact hard ground or wear on road wheels etc."
modelmakers,37c1td,llordlloyd,1 point,Thu May 28 13:26:58 2015 UTC,"Thanks! I'll have a look at this Testors.

modelmakers,378oj8,shy247er,6,Mon May 25 19:57:19 2015 UTC,"Since you're talking BBJ class business jets, I take it you're not too interested in smaller jets? Testors makes a 1/48 Learjet 24, Revell makes a 1/48 Lear 35, and Revell also makes a 1/48 Cessna Citation I from old Hasegawa molds. Might be others, but those came to mind. You also said only 1/144, so beats me if any of these are available in smaller scales...  As for the BBJ, it sounds like the window spacing is different between the -700 and -800, and of course the overall length is different by 19'2"", or about 1.6"" in 1/144 scale. Some of this was in front of the wing, some behind the wing. Here's a guy woman who converted Revell's 737-800 to the rest of the 737NG family, the -600, -700, -800, and -900. It looks like she referenced these PDF drawings for her conversions. Also check out this big PDF, specifically page 37 (PDF page 41) for dimensioned drawings of the whole 737 family which will tell you how much of the fuselage stretch, by the numbers, was in front of and behind the wing."
modelmakers,378oj8,Dr_Von_Spaceman,3,Mon May 25 21:08:41 2015 UTC,"First of, thank you for the great reply.  That thread and PDFs are exactly what I've been searching for, so thanks a lot! Window spacing issue might end up being above my skill level but I'm willing to give it a try.  As far as kits you suggested I'm trying to stick to 1/144 scale. My long term plan is to have some of my all time favourite aircrafts and spacecrafts built so having them all in the same scale would be ideal thing.  It is strange that business jets opportunities are so small. Some absolute beauties from Embraer, Bombardier, Gulfstream, Dassault exist so it's a shame we don't have them as model kits too. Hopefully one day.  Anyways, amazing help. Thank you!"
modelmakers,378oj8,Dr_Von_Spaceman,3,Mon May 25 21:55:57 2015 UTC,"I was a little surprised by how few business jet kits I found with my cursory search. A Citation X, at least one Falcon, a Gulfstream? Hope. Not a thing other than pre-built corporate desktop models, which are fine but not especially fun to put together since they're in one piece and already painted...  A suggestion about the windows: Jessica's solution was to fill all the windows and use window decals instead of ""real"" windows. This avoids fixing the window spacing, it avoids having to make your window spacing correct across your fuselage cuts, and also fixes the windows apparently being a little too low on the Revell kit. I'd probably go this route too."
modelmakers,378oj8,Dr_Von_Spaceman,3,Mon May 25 22:03:36 2015 UTC,"Do you know where can custom decals be ordered from?

I usually don't care much for historical accuracy but the kit comes with decals for Castlerobin IV which I found information about http://www.northirishhorse.net/articles/3-1-3-h.html. Castlerobin IV was an NA75 which had their main gun replaced with 75mm guns from knocked out Shermans. Dragon makes a NA75 kit WITH the same Castlerobin IV decals in it so the Mk.IV kit is a terrible crime of a kit."

I just figured downvoting was disabled with the attitude of not putting each other down. Apparently there's something different on my account...  Edit: I'll typically upvote anything that impresses me, or a newbie who clearly is excited about the work they did and could use the encouragement. But comments mean more to me than any imaginary internet points - when I post, it's not the upvotes I'm looking for - I want to hear everybody's feedback.

modelmakers,375htt,flounderflound,10,Mon May 25 04:48:29 2015 UTC,"I don't really see the need for a downvote button. Upvote if you like it and if you don't, leave it alone. But there's no need to be putting people down. I agree - we should be welcoming people. Downvoting is mere naysaying. I would hope if somebody saw something they didn't care for in one of my builds, they'd offer some constructive criticism, not just downvote away. Might as well be saying ""you suck, go away"".  I do like that there's a downvote button for comments, though. I've seen people cutting others down on here (only once or twice), but when people do something like that it's a good indicator that the rest of the group either doesn't agree with them or they don't feel he/she should be commenting in such a way.  People here post for two main reasons: to ask for help or to show something they're proud of. Neither such case should be met with the hostility of a downvote. If somebody had told me my first glue bomb was crap, I may not have continued with this hobby 24 years ago. Instead, people have offered suggestions and encouragement and I kept at it and slowly got better. Then when joining this sub it got even better because I suddenly found myself among peers with a wealth of knowledge to share. And I get to share what I know with others. I think we have a responsibility to help each other grow. Constructive criticism is part of that. Downvoting really isn't."

It really got to be a huge problem on /r/gunpla when haul posts started to outnumber actual builds about 5 to 1 a few years ago, granted that sub is much more active than this one. They've since fixed most of it and I'm probably just a bit biased against seeing just boxes after that.   Old retired kits... sure those are fine granted it's not just a picture of the cover. I'd think you'd want to see what's in it, like some existing posts have done.   For new posts, I'm extremely conflicted because I just got this kit which was JUST released earlier this May and I've never seen a model so well done as a whole presentation/package (and I kinda want to show it off and let others know this awesome kit exists...). But I also don't feel it warrants it's own post. I may use that pic (or a better taken one) in a future WIP post and the final gallery but... I'm torn, I'm sure you have better judgement than I to make sure this place doesn't become /r/gunpla of a few years ago. I'll just withhold my voting on boxes at all until I snap or something..."

That's some fancy packaging. Take pictures for your WIP post. Who made it? I see it's a Panzer I, but I can't quite make out who made it.  Anyway, yeah. I also don't want the sub to get subsumed beneath ""Here is my stash"" posts, although an occasional (like monthly) stash thread is probably okay. Same with workbench shots, although those I think are more useful to beginners since usually they demonstrate that you don't need a massive workbench and a garage full of paint to make good models.   I don't downvote box posts, anyway... Mostly I'll reply encouraging them to post pictures as they go and when it's built."

Their first two were a pair of FT-17s with riveted and cast turrets (I have a cast turret coming) and it seems they're coming out with an Ausf J Panzer I with a larger gun according to the box. It even comes with figures that look very good and at 1/72 too! Flyhawk are definitely a favorite for me now, I can only hope more companies take 1/72 armor as seriously as they seem to have.... but yeah, I'll have more pics when I start it or as an addendum to this weeks WIP Wednesday post, I've got some Tiger II rehaul stuff going on and finished my Elefant's link and length tracks... and my Warpig still hasn't come yet.. come on SAL.  A monthly stash thread sounds fine. There was a period of two weeks a few months back where there were tons of workbench stuff in a very small amount of time. I think most complaints people have can be answered by the fact that there aren't a whole ton of regular posts so when there are repetitive posts in a short time, it becomes magnified relative to other posts.  If a box post was even a 2 image album of the box and the contents or the partially built kit, regardless of build quality, it would be magnitudes better than just a box. I feel there aren't enough other posts per day yet for just a box alone to be enough."

modelmakers,375htt,MMGeoff,5,Mon May 25 02:21:46 2015 UTC,"Personally, I think it's mainly the fact that the mods have hidden the downvote button.

I am not interested in car models whatsoever but I'm not going to downvote a car.  I've felt compelled to downvote posts containing ""beginner questions"" that have been answered by the stickied posts on the sidebar, but I let my impotent rage simmer down and I'll ignore the post if I don't respond to it with my actual answer.

modelmakers,375htt,solipsistnation,1 point,Mon May 25 22:20:44 2015 UTC,"That may be true, but that probably doesn't account for all of them. Further, model making isn't a passive hobby; to get good, you have to learn to seek out solutions yourself. For many of us, I imagine that's part of the interest. If you're so lazy that you simply want everything to be spoonfed to you, that's great, but I also think that it shouldn't be encouraged. It leads to the kind of ""every time I have a question, I'm going to plaster the sub with questions, and then another question, and then another question.""   I remember one memorable one where the person flat out refused to read the wiki after being told that his direct answer to the question was right there. I recall getting a little snarky and going ""if you can't even read something that people have pointed out to you numerous times just because you're lazy, you're not going to get very far making models.""   I agree with /u/MMGeoff. I don't downvote beginners builds. However, there are some builders (and if they enjoy it, great for them, but it is not a quality post) who slap stuff together and are proud that they did a sloppy job, and rarely, get defensive when constructive criticism is given.   I guess what I'm saying is that while the sub is here to encourage beginners and advanced people alike, it shouldn't also be some kind of mollycoddling to the point where constructive criticism is little more than ""WOW GREAT JOB! IT LOOKS AMAZING!""   By analogy, doing something like that is like putting up those ""gates"" that you can pop up for beginners at bowling alleys that make it so that you can't roll a gutterball. As a friend of mine said: when my kids learn to bowl, there's no way in hell I'm putting those gates up. They want to do well, then learn to bowl properly."

modelmakers,375htt,Anonieme_Angsthaas,9,Mon May 25 01:40:54 2015 UTC,"No, I think you made a post that annoyed people (or that people are downvoting because they think it's funny). I'm guessing it's the lurkers, but /u/notHooptieJ has a point-- meta posts aren't usually very popular.   I honestly have only a vague idea about up and downvotes on here. Stuff that's repetitive (multiple posts on a single build within a couple of days of each other) tends to get downvoted. Stuff that's pretty clearly minimal effort, even first build posts, tends to get downvoted. Good photography helps with upvotes, of course... I kind of suspect there are people who downvote all of a particular subject-- all armor, or all planes, or whatever. And of course reddit does a little vote fuzzing, which may show up as phantom downvotes.   I don't think it's a bot, though-- I think it's that the audience has grown pretty dramatically over the past year. Check it out:  http://redditmetrics.com/r/modelmakers  I suspect we'll hit 10,000 subscribers by July. We've been out of the ""tiny close community"" category for a long time. There is still a core of under a hundred regular contributors, but more often I'm seeing people I don't recognize posting and commenting, or coming to recognize new people. As we grow, up and downvote standards are going to change just because there will be more people voting.   I seldom downvote anything-- it has to be a REALLY minimal effort (""Here's my unpainted snap-tite kit with missing pieces!""), or obvious blogspam. (Which I downvote and then mark as spam, because that'll show 'em!) I don't downvote noobs. I usually upvote any decent-looking build or an interesting question. I downvoted a lot of Metal Earth posts right after Christmas because there were so many of them for a while.   So, I dunno. I don't think it's a bot since that would be a lot of work just to slightly annoy a handful of people. It's most likely just people clicking for whatever reason.

modelmakers,375htt,LemonGear,5,Fri May 29 01:27:02 2015 UTC,"There is also the issue that, while this thread has always been very encouraging and understanding to new builders, the increase in traffic has also led to many of the types of builds described in the above comment.   Many of the newbie threads constantly ask the same questions over, and over, and over, and over again, and there's signs that in many cases, these problems could've been solved by (1) reading a wiki (which the sub DOES provide) and (2) a quick search of either old topics, or google, or even basic common sense.   There are also a lot of ""please subsidize my laziness"" threads these days, too. ""I'm trying to get started, HALP!"" threads..two threads above ANOTHER thread that said exactly the same thing, and asked the exact same questions.   I totally understand that first builds should be encouraged, and of course, in many cases, it's someone new to the hobby who loves that they just got it done as opposed to how to improve. I've seen numerous builders I saw first start building two years ago (that's about how long I've been here) become very accomplished builders in that time.   However, at the same time, this is like that ""everyone gets a certificate of participation"" mentality that leads to no improvement. It's a hobby, yes, but while we should encourage beginners (and this sub is quite famous for doing so), it also should not be ""oh look, ANY BUILD IS AWESOMESAUCE."" That's not true, and it's a disservice to both the aspiring builder and the commenter to say such things when it's clearly not the case, and the build is covered with gaps, sticky glue fingerprints, and the like.   It's a balance that has to be struck between providing encouragement, but also moving the ball forward and having the newbies become some of builders who I started with who now are also offering mentoring to the newer people.   I see a comment below that might be used as a reply. Yes, of course. Some of the people here are quite young, or budget limited. I am NOT saying that everyone here needs an airbrush and all this stuff, etc, etc, etc. I constantly suggest that newbies begin with things like an airfix starter set, and the like. If anything, there should be a wiki update to provide for a very good ""on a budget"" tutorial for the newbies and people on a shoestring budget. It's possible to make very good models even with only basic equipment; many of the conveniences like airbrush and the like, are just that, conveniences. It's just like weathering powders. While you can spend a lot of money on that sort of thing, the basic premise is that prior to them being a product, they were basically just repurposed artist materials that one could get on the cheap at any art store. Beginner help threads often list good resources to not only operate within a budget, but also produce good models with that budget.   Like I said, there has to be a balance, between encouraging a newbie, but also offering useful criticism and technical advice.   Also, downvotes on comments are useful. It can provide information as to whether or not the advice or comment is useful or constructive. Downvoting on topics....it's a way to police the threads, if it's not abused. And currently, no, there is no downvote button, at least not one I see in my browser.  It's also a question of content policing and usefulness. How many ""yay my first build!"" posts or ""HALP I don't know what to get"" posts before it clutters the frontpage to the point where it's not useful for mid-level or high-level builders? There has to be a balance struck somewhere."

That's not true, and it's a disservice to both the aspiring builder and the commenter to say such things when it's clearly not the case, and the build is covered with gaps, sticky glue fingerprints, and the like.    Yeah, I agree. In these cases I usually try to find something nice to say (""That was some very clean painting on the wheels"" or something) and then add on ""...but on your next build you might look at using putty/sanding/thinning your paint/using less glue/whatever."" That way they get some encouragement and it sounds less like I'm just saying ""LEARN TO BUILD NOOB.""   There have only been a couple of builds where I haven't been able to find something nice to say, and on those I just don't comment. (But I don't comment on everything, so if I didn't post on one of yours, don't assume I was off holding my tongue about how bad it was, heh. 8)  I am vaguely considering an advanced modelmaking sub so people who want to get more into oil paint stuff and avoid the ""how do i airbrush"" posts can go off there. But I don't want to pull the very helpful advanced builders from here, and I don't want to end up moderating two subs (although this one is pretty low-key)."
modelmakers,375htt,LemonGear,8,Mon May 25 17:45:58 2015 UTC,Be more  lenient. Please! This is part of the reason why only a few model makers are active here! Not everyone has an airbrush or even have money for lots of paint. Remember that art project you made as a kid? It's shit but your parents or teacher probably still said it's nice.
modelmakers,375htt,windupmonkeys,5,Mon May 25 10:46:00 2015 UTC,"Indeed. Nobody sets out to build a shit model, and surely all of us started somewhere.  I remember a Matchbox Spitfire IX from when I was about 7: gloss lime green and brown, made on a plastic carpet protector on the floor. It was really awful, but I liked it at the time and it's one step in the path to the (hopefully) passable models I can turn out these days.  Also, there are sites of incredible work- I'm looking to you, Czech Republic-based modelling societies and show- which is just so fantastic it leaves me kind of demoralised.  But to the question, I thought reddit used an algorithm that adds downvotes and upvotes, the sheer quantity intended to average out spamming attempts. Or something."
modelmakers,375htt,HughJorgens,2,Mon May 25 11:32:11 2015 UTC,"I totally agree with you on this. If I had read some of this stuff before I started posting, I probably wouldn't have at all. Even now it's sorta discouraging that people clearly have all these personal criteria but they make it known by down voting instead of voicing them. I've not received one bit of criticism on any of my posts on this sub since I started posting but clearly there are people holding back. About the only criticism I can infer from the actual comments I get are the qualified compliments in the form of ""good job.. for the size"" type stuff, which I'm fine with."

I like drawing crap too as a hobby and with that I ran into a problem where I was showing my friends my stuff and they were praising... like too much and that hurt the speed of my progress as a whole. I am infinitely more self-confident about my modeling but the recent down vote stuff on this sub sort of brought the thought up to the back of my head that.. I show people here my stuff and my friends... and I am my only critic. It's not a huge deal in this case because I have that level of self-confidence already but.. I was reading about an IPMS event/show held by IPMS San Diego soon and saw the contests and read up on rules and criteria for judging.. maybe that spurred on this rant, I could do better if I knew what to look for rather than the (as you said) fringe down votes. I'll go back to not paying attention to them but this thread kinda put all the dirty laundry out in the open so to speak haha.  Also thanks! So far they're actually a major motivator though... when I can make a post without a qualified comment, I'll pat myself on the back.. I'm sure it can be done!"

modelmakers,376v30,Ghoda,4,Mon May 25 11:37:45 2015 UTC,I accidentally snapped all the pitots and various antennae off the underside of a plane I was building (leading to the Don't Glue The Fiddly Bits Till Very Last accord of 2014) - sent an email to Revell Germany asking how to buy a replacement sprue and they mailed me the sprue free of charge
modelmakers,376v30,HughJorgens,1 point,Mon May 25 12:21:14 2015 UTC,"Are there similar parts you can measure?  Or can you guess how big they are, I might have some spares from a different kit that would work.  I will check later, it's from a big kit, that's why I need an approximate size."
modelmakers,3767j3,Fortunate_0ne,3,Mon May 25 05:31:48 2015 UTC,"This is a fun comparison by contrast. Having just finished Tamiya's 1/48 F-4U1 with PE everywhere and resin control surfaces, and having just opened my next real project (Eduard's 1/48 ""Early Lightnings"" P-38), I was shocked at the simplicity of this build.  My wife gifted this to me as a little weekend project.  She found it at hobby lobby for 11$ or so.   It has taken the better part of a day to get it assembled to this point. With a grand total of 17 parts, it took me longer to try my hand at cutting masks than it did the rest of the project combined. For comparison, with the PE, there were more parts used in the cockpit of the Corsair build than this whole model.   This isn't a bad kit and seems to be going pretty well. At this point I've ran out of primer so things will be on hold for a bit. The most ambitious undertaking about this build is trying to not disturb the raised panel lines while sanding seams and replacing the molded gun tubes with master model brass tubing (should arrive this week). As you can see, all that is left of Revell's plastic gun barrels are crudely drilled holes in the wings.   If not for those hold ups, I could spend memorial day airbrushing on some paint and all but wrapping this quick and fun little build up."

modelmakers,374vv7,Madfish1,3,Sun May 24 22:14:47 2015 UTC,"And after a 4(ish) month hiatus I've managed to get the motivation to build again...  The fitting in this kit is excellent, very few if almost any fit issues. The only issue I had was getting the wheels into position and the propellers into position as you have to apply quite a bit of force to get them seated.  Overall, I'm pretty happy with this one and I took the opportunity to gain as much practise as possible using an airbrush. So I guess next I'll be practising panel line shading.  I did realise though after I had taken the image that I had forgotten to but the antenna on that goes on top of the main fuselage, but I haven't a clue where it is unfortunately haha"

I've found it easy enough to use and get used to after a little bit of playing around. I can't say anything about other airbrushes though, others on here would be far better informed than me.  As far as recommendations go, make sure you get a cleaning kit as you buy one, even one of the cheap(ish) Amazon ones that come with the little brushes and bottle of Vallejo airbrush cleaner. I skimped out on this in the first few weeks and paid for it with constant blockages."

modelmakers,372z06,fjahja,3,Sun May 24 11:23:25 2015 UTC,"Sorry for the noob question: what is a flat coat, what does it do, and when do you apply it (is it multiple times). I'm guessing it makes the model darker, and is applied at the end; how close am I?"
modelmakers,372z06,Plundersquirrel,3,Sun May 24 19:54:42 2015 UTC,"It's okay man. I used to be confused with that as well. Flat coat is a clear paint with flat (matte) finish. This kind of paint do not add colour, only change the finish of the paint you are applying on. In my case I used MrColor C182. It does not make the model darker, in fact it will increase brightness, add dull and washout to your coat color.   I am currently at work so the best example is from my projects.   This is from before flat finish: Jan 2015. I used 1 layer of gloss coat.  This is after 3 layers of flat: May 2015. By 3 layers, I mean I applied the first layer, then wait until it dries in about an hour, then apply the second layer, wait about the same amount of time, then brushed the final layer. This will create a thick finish, will increase brightness, less contrast, and a generally more realistic look for military vehicles.  For heavily weathered vehicles, like dusty Abrams in OIF or snow effects on T34s during Stalingrad, the flat is a perfect base/platform for the next weather effects to be applied on."

But the kit comes with two options for tracks - either the usual separate wheels and link and length tracks, or with the running gear and tracks already partially assembled. I went with the second but when it came time to fit them I couldn't get them lined up with the holes on the hull. There are also tiny metal wires to make handles on the turret. Lots of them. I drilled out the holes but when I started fitting them I just got into a mess of superglue and bent wire.   In hindsight I could have just went with the link and length tracks and filled the holes on the turret, but at that point I wasn't interested in building it any more.   A couple of other kits I've dumped are 1/72 scale SAS Jeep - I think it was Dragon. The pieces were too tiny for me. And a Titanic model that I had almost fully assembled then realised I should have painted it it stages.   No regrets. There's always another kit to build :)"

Oil from your fingers maybe? Acrylics are more prone to do this. Did you prime your kit first?  You might have to buy some aftermarket decals. They are usually superior to kit decals anyway

modelmakers,370ovu,HughJorgens,1 point,Sun May 24 01:06:35 2015 UTC,"In my world, there are always unnecessary hurdles to overcome to get a model finished. In fact, I just consider them part of it now.  Masking canopies needs both a mask, and a way of applying the paint so it doesn't sneak under the mask, which it will do in normal circumstances. Either airbrush lightly, building the paint up gradually (I use black first for opacity), or if you brush use a dryish brush and stroke along the frame, so as not to drive wet paint under the mask.  Wise after the fact, I know!  You know this now, but never put tape over a decal, no matter how 'de-stickied' and no matter how 'sealed' the decal may be under Future, gloss or whatever. If you have to mask, lay thin tape beside the decal and tape a paper mask to that, avoiding the decal itself.  If you would like some replacement 109E decals, PM me."
modelmakers,37144r,TheWierdAsianKid,3,Sat May 23 21:56:31 2015 UTC,"Finding polycement and paints should be easy on the internet (even Amazon will have em) although it's always good to support local 'bricks and mortar' model shops if you can (they're a bit of a dying breed).  Revell seem to be the go to brand for polycement. You can get it in basic toothpaste style tubes (I'd avoid that), little bottles with brush-like applicators or precision applicators with metal nozzles. It's pretty much personal preference on the type of applicator that you use, just be aware that it's very easy to over apply polycement so apply sparingly. If you get too much on the parts it'll melt and ruin the smaller details.  A far as paint goes, most model makers use either acrylic or enamel (and oil for weathering). I'd recommend sticking with acrylic for the time being because you can thin them and wash your brushes with plain tap water. There are a number of different brands available depending on where you live. Tamiya are pretty universally available but they're pretty stinky for acrylics.  Concerning the thickness, you can buy specific acrylic thinners but if you're just brush painting water should do. Remember, multiple thin coats are better than one thick coat. Getting the paint to adhere nicely requires the use of a primer. These have a different chemical makeup to ordinary paint. I use automotive primer (in spray can form).  I hope there's some useful info there. I'm on my phone and it's hard to review/edit on this screen. Just ask if you have any other questions. Have you got all the tools you need for instance?"

I just thought of one more thing when looking at your kit: when it comes to glueing the clear parts like the windscreen don't use poly cement or superglue as these will 'cloud' the parts. Use pva (elmers) instead.

modelmakers,36ynmj,LemonGear,1 point,Sat May 23 05:52:37 2015 UTC,I'm pretty sure your stickers were actually waterslide decals. You should soak them in water for about 20-30 seconds then use something like the back of a brush to gently slide it off the paper. Use a cotton swab or tissue to remove any excess water when it's in place. That was my process for the most part when I had minimal tools or setting solutions.

modelmakers,36y049,Password_is_guest1,4,Sat May 23 01:37:54 2015 UTC,A real cheap introduction would be to get the Airfix Spitfire starter kit and an xacto hobby knife. That's all you need to build the kit and paint it in a basic way. $20 maybe? Not sure about the prices where you are. You could build this over a few evenings. The first build usually comes with a lot of learning experiences though! http://www.airfix.com/uk-en/supermarine-spitfire-mkia-starter-set-1-72.html

modelmakers,36y049,Uncle_Humpy,6,Sat May 23 02:45:26 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't worry about weathering on your first build. Just try to get a clean build and finish. But if you do want to do something, the simplest effective thing is to make up a wash of enamels, cover the entire finished model with it, and carefully remove most of it with a rag and cotton buds dipped in enamel thinner. This will leave accents in panel lines etc. The small Tamiya enamel bottles are good for this. Get a brown, a black and a thinner, and mix the wash with a small drop of both of the former mixed in a little of the later. Because the base coat of your model is acrylic this wash will not affect the paint (never use this over enamels!) Before this you might also want to give the model a sealing coat of acrylic clear (again, I typically use Tamiya). Also, you might find doing all this without the canopy glued on easier. (Canopies are mysterious beasts and will probably be the most difficult part for beginners.)  One tip for painting: don't overwork the paint! When you apply it with a brush it will sometimes look rough with streaks etc. If you work these they will often get worse as the paint dries on your brush. Instead, get in there and get the paint applied quickly, leave it and it will self-level to a certain extent. Come back and give it another coat when this has thoroughly dried."

modelmakers,36vu0u,JangoFett101,2,Fri May 22 18:15:19 2015 UTC,Thank you for providing all the links and the great compliments! That build was new territory for me. I had never done ground work before. I had a rough idea of what I wanted it to look like but wasnt very sure on how to do it. So I kinda made it up as I went along. its been a while now since I finished it. Think its time to get in the chair again ;)
modelmakers,36vu0u,mrcoffee83,1 point,Sat May 23 02:00:27 2015 UTC,i'm looking at getting some of the Tamiya Weathering Master things (or an alternative of) over the weekend to practice on my ye old tamiya Panther A  what do you use to seal it with? i don't have an airbrush so i'd imagine brushing a varnish over the top or some Klear would destroy the effect?
modelmakers,36vu0u,Gewehr43,3,Fri May 22 18:05:51 2015 UTC,You don't.  The Weather Master stuff absolutely vanishes with any kind of clear coat over it.  It's pretty much the last thing you do to a model before you put it on the shelf or in a display case.
modelmakers,36vu0u,TheMeowsteh,1 point,Fri May 22 18:28:54 2015 UTC,What is the putty that you use for airbrushing can I just use play dough?Also where can I get a good airbrush?
modelmakers,36vu0u,solipsistnation,3,Fri May 22 18:11:28 2015 UTC,"Putty for masking camoflage? Mostly I think people use Blu-Tack, like the stuff for hanging posters. I've heard of people using Silly Putty. I don't think I'd use playdough like comes in cans and gets eaten by toddlers-- it tends to dry kind of gritty and I don't know how it would react to being painted over.   You can get good airbrushes at Amazon or elsewhere. What's your budget? If you haven't done any airbrushing before, look for an airbrush around 60 bucks (like a Badger or Iwata) and a little hobby compressor under $100. There are lots of airbrush questions on here if you want to check around."
modelmakers,36vu0u,TheMeowsteh,1 point,Fri May 22 18:17:04 2015 UTC,Thanks a lot i'm a beginner at modelling and this is pretty useful. Is there anything else I should know?
modelmakers,36vu0u,solipsistnation,2,Fri May 22 19:26:45 2015 UTC,Lots. 8) Read a lot of things and see what you can learn.
modelmakers,36vu0u,Medjoe,1 point,Fri May 22 21:28:14 2015 UTC,"Blu Tack? Hm, then I have another question related to this, stemming from seeing images after the paint was sprayed. Is it reusable after it is painted on, i.e. wash it with water and it's ready to be applied again or is it single-use?"
modelmakers,36vu0u,solipsistnation,2,Fri May 22 21:16:26 2015 UTC,No idea!
modelmakers,36vu0u,FlyingLowSH,1 point,Fri May 22 21:28:02 2015 UTC,"Hey there.    I'm using type cleaner like this. Just two important things: Only apply to dried color on the model and don't let it in place for too long. Both could leave patches, similar to water stains."
modelmakers,36vu0u,Mmmmm_Napalm,1 point,Fri May 22 21:42:40 2015 UTC,"Can anyone direct me to a good gloss coat spray (rattle can)? Also, I have a more specific question in regards to a specific model, Bandai's 1/72 scale TIE Advanced.   Does anyone know what paint I should use for the tips of the laser cannons? I looked at a translated color guide for the model, but the brand it says to utilize is a lacquer based paint, and I would prefer to use acrylics."
modelmakers,36vu0u,bobbotlawsbotblog,2,Fri May 22 18:16:05 2015 UTC,"The TIE fighter question:  Lacquer paints are probably Mr Hobby.  Check the number, then find a Mr Hobby color chart.  That'll tell you what color you need.  Then look for a Tamiya chart and find the same color."
modelmakers,36vu0u,jalien,1 point,Fri May 22 23:09:13 2015 UTC,"You can also use an app :-) I use one called ""Model Paint 42"". You can search for a particular paint via name or ref number and it will find it and tell you similar colors in different paint types and manufacturers."
modelmakers,36vu0u,AngryEchoSix,1 point,Sat May 23 01:14:22 2015 UTC,"I'll have to check that one out. I use iModelKit right now and it's really good at cross referencing paints, and also has a mixing section so you can mix up your own to match a particular color. Pretty handy, but only available on iOS devices if I remember correctly."
modelmakers,36vu0u,jalien,1 point,Sun May 24 13:22:33 2015 UTC,Cool. I will check out your suggestion too! My suggestion has an awful interface and it's clunky to use but the info is not bad.
modelmakers,36vu0u,SnarkMasterRay,1 point,Sun May 24 15:56:46 2015 UTC,"Can anyone direct me to a good gloss coat spray?   By spray, do you mean rattle can? Or can it be airbrushed? I've used Future Floor Wax, which is now sold in the states as Pledge with Future shine in most cases. It airbrushes well and can be polished. I've also used Testors Sealer for Metalizer (on regular paints) but I'm not finding it on their site and it might be discontinued."
modelmakers,36vu0u,Duke_of_Fritzburg,2,Fri May 22 23:00:11 2015 UTC,I use Future or Testors Glosscoat for a glossy finish before decaling and Testors Dullcoat after all is done. Warning! do not get Testors products on clear parts. It will fog them bad.

modelmakers,36u6ui,sleepwalker77,2,Fri May 22 03:46:45 2015 UTC,"After 2 months of on and off efforts, I've finally wrapped this Meteor up. I've made a ton of mistakes on this thing, but I think it looks pretty great from an arms distance. It's my first time using aftermarket parts (cockpit PE set), and it gave me an excuse to test out my new airbrush. I didn't go too wild on the weathering front, just basic washes and dry-brushing. All told, this is probably my most successful project so far."
modelmakers,36u6ui,MadMorf,3,Fri May 22 04:18:17 2015 UTC,Really nice work!
modelmakers,36u6ui,84mg09,3,Fri May 22 03:56:21 2015 UTC,Very cool! Cockpit looks amazing!
modelmakers,36u6ui,flounderflound,2,Fri May 22 04:09:35 2015 UTC,Great job! It's making me lean even more toward picking one up.
modelmakers,36u6ui,Jabnl,2,Fri May 22 04:36:50 2015 UTC,It gets the recommendation from me. Its always nice when models are both fun to build AND nicely detailed. It came with a buzz bomb too (my brother built it as his first kit)
modelmakers,36u6ui,doubleDoo,2,Fri May 22 04:45:00 2015 UTC,Looks great!
modelmakers,36u6ui,apothekari,2,Fri May 22 09:32:41 2015 UTC,"Awesome job!, that's a really nice build. I never realized how beefy the undercarriage is on those planes. Those big balloon tires look like they make landing fun."
modelmakers,36xbax,dungeonkeeper91,3,Fri May 22 21:59:58 2015 UTC,"I agree that it would be a much better use of resources to buy and build a new kit. I think fixing the model you have would be a fun exercise, but a lot of work depending on how nice you want it to look. But I'm a masochist like that."
modelmakers,36xbax,Dr_Von_Spaceman,2,Sat May 23 00:36:45 2015 UTC,"The build quality on this kit isn't particularly good, and the kit itself is old and lowish quality. I think you would be putting money into a lost cause here. I reckon you should buy a new kit (the Academy 1/72 B-17 is cheap and better that this) some glue, paint and basic tools and have a good at building it. And post here for guidance! I guarantee you will have fun."
modelmakers,36xbax,Uncle_Humpy,3,Fri May 22 22:43:19 2015 UTC,Hmm. Well that's disappointing. Maybe I can still use it as wreckage for a stop motion film or something? I guess I'll figure something out. Thank you.
modelmakers,36xbax,BorisIvanovich,1 point,Fri May 22 22:55:53 2015 UTC,"Same boat as you, i ended up buying a new one and am going to make a crash diorama out of the old. Best you can do sometimes. Revell quality is bad enough that it doesn't hurt too much"
modelmakers,36xbax,EM2Hero,2,Sun May 24 19:34:20 2015 UTC,Maybe you can make it into a diorama crash piece?
modelmakers,36xbax,Fortunate_0ne,1 point,Fri May 22 23:15:01 2015 UTC,Was considering that as well. Just hate to ruin it anymore lol
modelmakers,36xbax,Fortunate_0ne,1 point,Fri May 22 23:46:05 2015 UTC,"As far as how to fix it that would be on par with the state of the model, some Tamiya liquid cement could be used to put the fuselage back together. Simply wrap the fuselage with some rubber bands to hold it together, then run a line of liquid cement down the seam.  It won't look great, but...  As others have mentioned, that exact kit is still available and relatively cheap. You could just start from scratch with a new kit. Or, if there is some really strong sentimental ties with your model, you could just use the parts from a newer version of the kit to fix the broken, missing or damaged parts on the one that you have in hand.  I am of the school of thought that you should just build a new one."
modelmakers,36xbax,Fortunate_0ne,2,Sat May 23 02:20:16 2015 UTC,"It does indeed have sentimental value but everyone does seem to be on the ""just get a new one"" side of the fence. I was hoping to be able to restore it to where it would look as good as new again, but it sounds like that's impossible."
modelmakers,36xbax,windupmonkeys,2,Sat May 23 04:37:17 2015 UTC,"I don't think it's impossible to restore it to what it looked like when it was just completed. But, it would be a chore. My interpretation of the consensus is that with less effort and investment you could start with the kit and end up with something of better finished quality (sentimental value aside). Plus, there would be the added benefit of the satisfaction of building something yourself (even if only an homage to the original)."
modelmakers,36xbax,windupmonkeys,2,Sat May 23 20:21:33 2015 UTC,Fair point. Are there any you'd recommend looking into?
modelmakers,36xbax,windupmonkeys,2,Sat May 23 21:07:51 2015 UTC,"I built a Revell B-17 about 1990. That was the last time I've tried that kit out, and I was 11.   You can probably find that exact kit. It appears Revell has a 1/48 and 1/72 version of the Memphis Belle. Measure the wing span of the one you have and compare it to the specs online.   I have been ordering a lot of stuff from spruebrothers.com recently but it looks like the cheapest place is walmart.com."

modelmakers,36wr9a,EM2Hero,6,Fri May 22 19:27:39 2015 UTC,The latest Airfix kits and the new Revell kits as well. Other then that you can't go wrong with Tamiya IMHO  And accuracy? To be honest I don't know. I'm happy as long as it looks like the real vehicle
modelmakers,36wr9a,Anonieme_Angsthaas,1 point,Fri May 22 19:32:11 2015 UTC,"Thanks, I recently bought a Tamiya 1/35 Matilda tank, and cant wait to get it going. Overall quality looks fantastic, and from the builds ive seen people post on here, they are all fantastic. Same with Airfix. Thanks again I really appreciate the input :D"
modelmakers,36wr9a,Anonieme_Angsthaas,1 point,Fri May 22 20:25:08 2015 UTC,With Airfix you have to be a bit careful. They still have a few really old (and terrible) kits. For example the Tiger I in 1/72. Before you buy it's best to check the age of the kit on Scalemates.com.
modelmakers,36wr9a,alaskafish,1 point,Sat May 23 06:20:41 2015 UTC,"Dragon kits are usually on par. Everything fits like a dream, and are super duper detailed."
modelmakers,36wr9a,yawningangel,2,Sat May 23 06:00:24 2015 UTC,Dragon kits can be fiddly though and can have some really shitty instructions..
modelmakers,36wr9a,alaskafish,1 point,Sat May 23 07:16:36 2015 UTC,"Every company has bad instructions and can be ""fiddly"" (I honestly don't know what fiddly means)  Airfix, Revell, Trumpeter, ect, all have finicky kits. Dragon just doesn't have many."
modelmakers,36wr9a,yawningangel,2,Sat May 23 16:00:18 2015 UTC,"Well I've only built half a dozen, but I read build reviews before starting and two of them stated that following the instructions would lead to major headaches down the line,the photo instructions on a couple of the kits were pretty vague too..  I love dragon kit's tbh,they are pretty much my goto now. was just a comment that they also have issues,so thanks for the constructive feedback.."
modelmakers,36wr9a,Anonieme_Angsthaas,1 point,Sat May 23 16:21:33 2015 UTC,"Yes, I remember reading reviews of their Sd.Kfz 234/2 'Puma' kit in 1/35 and the details on things like the suspension are almost exactly like the original."
modelmakers,36wr9a,Timmyc62,5,Sat May 23 06:12:11 2015 UTC,"This falls under the same question as ""which brand is the best?"" and the answer is the same.  It depends on the individual kit and every brand has  their good kits and bad kits. The best way to go forward is to know what subject you want and ask who makes the best version of that subject.  That said, there are some brands that are almost always Junk because they haven't made new molds since the early-mid cold War, such as Lindberg, or they are really poor counterfeits from 1990s China like Zhengdefu."
modelmakers,36wr9a,FlyingSMonster,2,Fri May 22 19:57:09 2015 UTC,"I didn't see it mentioned yet, but I'll add Hasegawa to what others have said. Their newer kits are on-par, if not in some cases better than Tamiya.   Dragon is usually high quality, with a few misses here and there, and their instructions often have quite a few errors.   The worst offenders in my opinion though are Trumpeter / Hobby Boss. Very inconsistent quality, inaccuracies, they have stolen / copied parts in the past, etc."
modelmakers,36wr9a,Fortunate_0ne,2,Sat May 23 02:02:35 2015 UTC,"I was reading an old article yesterday about either Revell or Monogram's version of the B-25. Apparently at the time it was released (late 70's maybe) it was the bees-knees. So good, in fact, that the other company (Revell or Monogram) actually took the kit and simply made molds from the exact kit. The way the original company could tell that their kit was stolen was that not only did everything look exactly the same but that the plastic in the competitor's kit was all a tiny proportion smaller than the original. That tiny proportion was the exact same ratio of the shrinkage of plastic that you would expect if a plastic piece is used to make a mold and then reproduced."
modelmakers,36wr9a,solipsistnation,2,Sat May 23 02:14:43 2015 UTC,"Revell Germany armor. AFV Club armor. Tamiya armor, of course. The one Bronco kit (their Locust) I've built was nicely done with solid tracks molded with really nice sag. Nitto's Ma.K kits.   Trumpeter is a mixed bag, but their recent kits are generally very good."
modelmakers,36wr9a,yawningangel,1 point,Sat May 23 06:29:59 2015 UTC,I've only built one AFV model (sdkfz 251) and needed much sanding and filling..  Just unlucky?
modelmakers,36wr9a,FlyingSMonster,2,Sat May 23 07:18:07 2015 UTC,"I had the same experience. AFV club makes some interesting vehicles, but you have to put in quite a bit of work with them to get the plastic in good shape.  Lots and lots of flash, lots and lots of sink marks in bad places, and some poor-fit issues as well as instructional errors. They also have many very fragile, skinny plastic parts which break very easily often in their kits.   Even now, I'm working on their brand new M60A1 kit, and it requires a lot of clean-up on many of its parts. With that said, the cast hull texture on the turret and body of the vehicle is superb, and it should turn out into a very nice kit."
modelmakers,36wr9a,Nemephis,2,Sat May 23 19:21:12 2015 UTC,"For 1:48 WWII planes I would recommend Zvezda. They have higly detailed models, parts fit very well and the price is really nice.    Example: My Me-109 F2 from Zvezda, no after-market goodies added."
modelmakers,36wr9a,flounderflound,1 point,Sat May 23 08:54:35 2015 UTC,"Thanks, I was never really too sure about Zvezda before, but your example is quite the seller for me :D I guess it also comes down to personal  skill and patience as well"
modelmakers,36wr9a,mrcoffee83,1 point,Sun May 24 18:49:53 2015 UTC,"Airfix is really stepping up their game lately. They're designing stuff using radar and taking very accurate images as a result. And they're still affordable. Are they the best? I don't know about that, necessarily, but they're quickly becoming my favorite. I currently have 2 pending preorders from them - a Defiant and a Beaufighter."
modelmakers,36wr9a,flounderflound,2,Fri May 22 21:52:46 2015 UTC,"i agree, as a kid i built hundreds of their kits and even then as a ten year old i could tell the quality was crap  i've built a couple of the new tool 1/72 and 1/48 aircraft and they're in a different league in terms of quality , as well as excellent value for money"
modelmakers,36wr9a,flounderflound,1 point,Sat May 23 06:42:16 2015 UTC,"Yeah, they fit together really well, have recessed panel lines and smooth plastic - they are far above what they used to be."

modelmakers,36wr9a,flounderflound,1 point,Fri May 22 22:00:54 2015 UTC,"I've ordered directly from Airfix, but some third parties may already have them. Airfix has delayed the Defiant (original release date was 5/7 but now it's 5/27) and the Beaufighter is slated for 6/25. I know some European retailers already have the Defiants though. I'm still gonna wait for Airfix though because it guarantees I'm getting the new tooling, not accidentally buying one of the previous versions (with half a pilot sitting on a peg as a cockpit)."

modelmakers,36wr9a,Destructias_Warlord,1 point,Sat May 23 00:38:58 2015 UTC,Definitely would not call them the best. Best value? The newer kits whose cockpits don't consist of half a pilot sitting on a peg? Absolutely. The older ones? Absolutely not. Truthfully I don't know what I'd say is the actual best. I'm working on a couple of Special Hobby kits right now - these are pretty awesome but the directions almost look like alien hieroglyphics to me - I seem to be struggling with them. Hasegawa kits can be awesome but they can go the other way too. Tamiya kits are nice but very generic sometimes. Revell's kits seem to be getting better and are coming with massive numbers of decals but they're still issuing a lot of re-boxes too. Same with Italeri. I can't say who is best by any means.

What happens is that air escapes through microscopic holes created from the dirt and it starts spitting.   Take a look here

Basically: the turret has a rod at the bottom, the rod goes into the hole on the hull, then you put some glue on the ""cap"" and glue only the rod  to the cap. The turret is now ""trapped"", it can rotate but it cannot be removed.  Use only really tiny amounts of glue! If you use too much glue the glue will spill, welding together the rod and the hull."
modelmakers,36ui1v,ionizzatore,3,Fri May 22 09:08:00 2015 UTC,"This sounds similar to doing propellers. If the rod sticks through a hole in the cap I usually install it, then put a little cement on the backside only so it welds together but the cement never contacts the engine."

modelmakers,36s4ts,AdHocSpock,8,Thu May 21 18:05:24 2015 UTC,"You know. This is a really common and difficult question to answer in a lot of cases.   A lot of folks will tell you dual action airbrushes in the .3mm range are the only option. For some work, they are absolutely right. But they are not particularly suited for laying down large areas of paint. like primer and base coats or painting car bodies with a glass like finish.   In the dual action super fine catagory you have a lot of options and most of them are fairly expensive. ($100+)  Badger Patriot 105  Iwata HP-CS  Badger Renegade and Renegade Krome  Harder & Steenbeck INFINITY  And many more.. All these airbrushes are similar in performance and quality for the most part sorted from least to most expensive. It's not a complete list, etc.  My suggestion regarding these airbrushes is this. If you plan to do military models then they can be a real plus. Ships, airplanes and tanks/IFVs can really benefit from this sort of precision. If you plan to do model cars and trucks and anything that is meant to look clean and pretty, these will work but they will be a lot more work for you than a simple single action airbrush or small spray gun.  Single Action airbrushes tend to be more for large area work and priming etc. If I had to make a suggestion it would be, go for something less expensive and get two. I know that seems insane but if you say plan to spend $150. Maybe get something like the Patriot 105 and something from below. Single action brushes are typically less expensive to a certain degree.  (This first one will get a lot of flack from a lot of people, it's not ""The best"" and it's nothing amazing but for putting on a base coat it works just fine regardless of what any nay-sayer spews about it. It's also the same Airbrush that Adam From mythbusters uses so take that for what it's worth in your value judgements.)  Paasche Model H Airbrush set It's $50 and does a decent enough job and is easy to use and understand. It lays down a decent coat of paint and is better quality than most of the Master and other cheap-o models you can get on ebay, etc. It comes with three different tips for more or less paint flow and the two bottles and the metal cup if you don't want to use the bottles. The paint flow from this one is not going to be the best atomization and so if you try to do a fade with it you'll be able to tell but for a simple base coat of primer, etc it's hard to discount it at under $50.  I don't have any experience with any other airbrushes in this category except the Paasch VL set and honestly, it's not worth looking at so I won't provide any more links.  I suggest checking out Paul Budzik's youtube channel to learn more about airbrushes and such. He specifically says he doesn't care for the Paasche H and for good reasons if you have his budget to work with and do his level of work.   Disclaimer: I have worked with every one of these airbrushes mentioned above and thats why I specifically mentioned them but they are not the end-all be-all of airbrushes, simply ones I've used and think do a good job at thier price points. Do more research, other nice folks here will maybe post, and I hope you find what you are looking for! Paasche gets a lot of hate from a lot of people.. holy crap my posts are always so long, sorry mate!"

modelmakers,36s4ts,kwkfor,4,Thu May 21 23:30:56 2015 UTC,Any Iwata would be good. I've a Neo and an Eclipse HP-CS and am very happy with both of them.  But why not do your painting in the garage and use the compressor you have?  I have a little Porter Cable pancake compressor and crank it up to about 120PSI and then plug the air hose into another regulator that I use to tone down the pressure to the 10-20 PSI needed for the airbrush.  Works really well and would save you the hassle of lugging around the air tank.

The large, powerful or valuable vehicles are toward the center. Those are flanked by somewhat smaller and more maneuverable vehicles, which again are surrounded by even smaller vehicles. Each class of vehicle has it's own job, either supporting the big vehicles or quickly going out to attack incoming threats.

modelmakers,36onp3,ionizzatore,7,Thu May 21 05:37:09 2015 UTC,"It depends on the metal. Stainless steel doesn't really work, but brass or nickel silver are quite nice and easy. Probably the biggest mistake beginners make is they'll go to an electronics store and get a soldering iron and lead free solder. Lead free solder is horrid and very hard to work with, you really do need lead based solder. Rosin core is ok, but it tend to be a bit thick. Another thing that's very good to have is liquid flux. The flux helps clean the metal and aids the flowing of the solder. As for actually soldering the parts together, they need to be clean. Very clean. The flux will help but it can't do everything. Start off with a fibreglass brush and rub that all over the area to be soldered. Apply the flux and a small bit of solder. I cut little 1/16"" bits off the spool. It's easier to position these when everything is cool, rather than trying to carry the solder with the iron and getting too much. Apply the soldering iron to the solder/flux/part and spread it around until it's thin or joins the parts sufficiently. You can put solder on two parts and then bring them together and remelt it, or you can hold two parts together and then apply solder. I use both methods depending on the size of the parts. Small ones are much more likely to be tinned first, otherwise it's too likely that I'll lose the detail with too much solder. Give it a go. Start with the extra material from the edges of the fret. Rather than throwing it away use it to practice."

Personally if I was to do something like this I'd build the general terrain from foamboard, then replicate the mud with a plaster and dirt mixture.  To create my dirt I like to use and old flour siv get some dirt from the garden and roast it in the oven to both dry it and kill anything that might be in it. Then once cooled I'd siv it through so it's real fine. Remember it has to look right for the scale. Then you can add it to plaster, just sprinkle it on over wet white glue.

modelmakers,36nm5m,Medjoe,2,Wed May 20 21:36:00 2015 UTC,"Same here, I saw the real one and was considering getting a scale model to build as a souvenir, but I've been hesitant on the choice."
modelmakers,36nm5m,Medjoe,3,Wed May 20 21:58:51 2015 UTC,"Revell's P-51D in 1/72. It was a cheap kit when I bought, not one, but two of them (little did I know why...), and used them to get started with modelmaking, being the first kit I would attempt in over 10 years.  As I saw the sprues and started taking off the parts, I thought that every model would be just as full of flash in just about every corner, and every modelmaker was trained in the patient art of removing flash with a blade from the majority of pieces, thankfully that was an isolated incident and now I have better methods of choosing the right model, but it felt like a rough start. Also of note was the horizontal stabs, which was a single piece sandwiched between the two fuselages halves that was very tedious (ran into another one of those on their EC-135, imo it's worse that trying to attach vinyl tracks, but not by much...), because getting it to even look horizontal was annoying. The prop hub attached poorly and I couldn't care less for being able to spin the prop, but as it is the thing just wobbles and grinds on the surface... And the end result is something that somewhat resembles a P-51D, if you squint your eyes a little and look away from it. :) Still, it was good practice to gain sufficient confidence to keep on going."
modelmakers,36nm5m,windupmonkeys,3,Wed May 20 20:57:02 2015 UTC,"ACE Models BRM-1, in 1/72. Short kit, or old kit, something along those lines.   Flash on every single piece. Fit is atrocious on even simple things like the main hull (really, it's a box on wheels).   The worst part of the kit? It has link/length tracks. Flash all over the tracks, they don't fit properly, and I'm not even sure the upper hull can fit once the track runs are assembled.   I bought it deliberately a year ago as a challenge. I got as far as the tracks, or partial runs of it over a sprocket, and then stopped."
modelmakers,36nm5m,solipsistnation,1 point,Wed May 20 22:30:58 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I have an ACE CVR(T) Scorpion which I'd put right up there as the worst model I've even (not quite) built.   Flash, warped ill-fitting parts, and all in that weird soft short-run plastic. I'll finish it sometime, probably, except that it also has photoetch tracks in 2 parts per run that has to be annealed, bent, soldered (or whatever) and then somehow wrapped around the wheels and stuff. I really don't know what the hell to do with the kit, so it lives forever in the Oubliette Drawer along with the Airfix kit of the same tank, which looks nicer and fits better, even though it's a 70's-era Airfix kit, which should tell you a lot about the ACE one.  I know you shouldn't judge short-run kits by the same standards as the bigger companies, but man."

When I see an Ace kit of something I like, I find another kit of a similar variant and then steal bits from the Ace kit to 'convert.'  Worked out really well when I used a Trumpeter T-55 and converted it to the Enigma."
modelmakers,36nm5m,windupmonkeys,1 point,Thu May 21 16:54:29 2015 UTC,"I bought it for the challenge, I knew it would be bad. Just how bad became apparent much later. (I tend towards the building side of things; it's why as much as I like the new detail on modern snap kits, as a builder, they are boring as all hell).   I still think it can get a respectable result, just that it takes far more effort all out of proportion to the quality of the final result.   The next worst manufacturer I've seen is PM, whose molds have since been scrapped as the owner died last year or something. That said, some of their kits really weren't bad, just very primitive. Their moldmakers were either strapped for resources, or were not that skilled, and the molds are decades old. It seemed like it was a ""every state has a local manufacturer"" kind of setup, but which by international standards, was pretty poor."
modelmakers,36nm5m,screamingcheese,1 point,Thu May 21 18:20:10 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure that PM's deal was a lack of access to good molding technology, due to them being in an ex-Soviet bloc nation; same might be the case for Ace."
modelmakers,36nm5m,windupmonkeys,1 point,Thu May 21 19:11:02 2015 UTC,"It is part of it, yes, which is why I qualified that. ACE's kits are horrible, but this is more a function of molds exceeding design life, probably, or lower quality molds. If they fit, they would actually be pretty good, and if you look at things coming out of the soviet bloc in the 1990s (Ukraine, in particular) they produced respectable stuff, if you could life with the compromises like more primitive engineering and less delicate details. I wouldn't be surprised to find ACE molds as short run items."

Compared to most other kits aside from maybe the Bird of Prey, it was considered an exceptionally good kit by AMT standards (and ironically enough, of one of the most obscure subjects in Star Trek, which appeared for a single episode only). Most AMT kits, and you'll find plenty of literature on this, while fitting decently or even well, were detail nightmares and wildly inaccurate. The Enterprise E was supposed to be good, but I never got my hands on one."

It is painted now, decals are in place and sealed. Now it is waiting for weathering, payload and gears. I changed the planned loadout. I was thinking about an AGM-65 and GBU-12, but after being corrected about the GBU-12 (which wasn't introduced in 1986 for F/A-18A's), I made some research. Neither the AGM-65 was ready to be used on F/A-18A's in 1986! Also both pods I planned to use on my model for the fuselage-hardpoints were not ready until 1989/90.    So my new (1986 approved) set-up lists as follows: empty wingtip - CBU-100 - Tank - AN/AAR-50 'TINS' - Tank - empty - TER with 3 x Mk. 81 iron bombs - AIM-7 - AIM-9.    Further hints are welcome! Pictures here.    Also I had some time to paint my NSAWC-Tomcat. Took long, but I am pretty satisfied with the result - except for the colors. I mixed them with Tamiya acrylics. Don't get me wrong, I am SUPER SATISFIED with these acrylics, they are awesome (recommended for everyone who's looking for acrylics suitable for airbrushes). But, even if mixed like said in an instructionsheet (Tamiya Aggressor F-16, 1:48), they don't seem to fit really good.    Any opinions? Repaint them or not? Pictures here."

modelmakers,36m2ms,ionizzatore,3,Wed May 20 16:15:38 2015 UTC,"One model at a time. Or: start to take a look at a new box only when the old kit is almost done (at weathering stage or already weathered and it only needs to be assembled) Model something that you like. There is nothing worse that try to finish a model that you don't like Sometimes you'll loose motivation. I have 2 models that are almost complete in my display case and i probably won't finish them Your supplies stash will build over time. Right now you have to buy everything, in some month you'll only need to buy new paints, in a couple of years you'll have almost everything in your tool stash   (imho)"

modelmakers,36m2ms,flounderflound,2,Wed May 20 13:26:26 2015 UTC,"I'm in the same boat. I finished my He 115 Sunday night and am supposed to be getting started on these two Special Hobby Whirlwinds for the RAF Groupbuild. Monday night I took them out of the boxes, stared at them for an hour and cut the fuselage halved from one of the sprues. Then did nothing else. Last night I didn't do a damn thing with them. That said, I've been running marathon modeling for the past few months now - just since January I've done a P-51, a B-17, a P-47, an Ar(E)555, a Bf 110, a Mosquito, a J7W Shinden, a G8N Rita, a B-29, a Hurricane, an He 219, and an He 115. That's twelve in four and a half months. And I love every minute of it. But it is exhausting - I usually start around 9 after the kids go to bed and don't end up getting to bed myself until around midnight. If you need to, take a few days and take a breather. I usually go play video games for a few nights. When heists came out for GTA5, it definitely took up some of my time. I came back to building when I was ready, though. Tonight I probably won't do much - I have a console that was an old childhood memory arriving in the mail today - I'd assume I'm gonna be up late playing tonight."

So if it's a tank, I watch old WWII movies like Patton, or hell even Fury if it floats your boat. World of Tanks and War Thunder are great sources of inspiration for me.   If it's a car I try to find a movie with a similar car, like old Jackie Chan movies where he drives a Mitsubishi of some sort around in a great car chase scene! Also Anime like Initial D, etc.  Airplanes? Find a related movie or place some Ace combat or seriously just google the name of the plane and look through the images for those awe-inspiring pictures of them with some beautiful sunset, etc. War Thunder but NEVER play World of Warplanes.   Mecha, Well, Watch Gundam anime (08th MS team is great if you like weathered and worn looking machines), play Armored core if you're into that sort of thing or Zone of the enders!. Mech Warrior online is pretty bad IMO but still gives me ideas and motivation to play it rarely. Hell, fucking Robot Jox from like 1989 if you are into really bad campy movies! (I'm a huge space/Sci-fi fan if you haven't gathered)  Ships? Ha! So many great movies! Red october, U-571, Tora Tora Tora!, Crimson tide, K-19, Hell. UNDER SIEGE! (rofl, just kidding), But Pearl Harbor is pretty decent for seeing a lot of ships, etc. Oh and World of Warships is surprisingly good if you want a good game, it's in CBT but you can spend $15 and get into it pretty easily now."

The maps are way too small. About 1/3 to 1/2 the size of WT maps  It only really features fighters, they are broken down into three classes but really they aren't very different. The lack of bombers and and the ground targets mean so little that it's reallly just a bunch of folks circling each other in what feels like a slow turning fight against the controls more than other players.   these are just my ~3 months of trying to like it exp mind you."

I'd suggest adding in a little bit of color variation by adding in some slightly differently-colored greys and browns--all close enough to the first blackish color you put on to not stand out, and just a little bit here and there, blended in thoroughly. Once that's done streak some soot back from the engine all the way out to the edge of the airframe (if you've got am airbrush you can airbrush some light streaks underneath pigments before you put them on as well)--these early jets in particular produced lots of nastiness that would streak back along the airframe like the exhaust from a propeller aircraft"

Build the cockpit, paint it, paint the walls of the cockpit. Wait for it to dry and glue the fuselage together and hope it all lines up.  And there always are some recessed parts ike engines, gear/bomb bays that need special masking. And heaven forbid I you're building a plane with lots of windows. You'll get to do the fun stuff called 'Canopy Masking'.  But when it's all done and you peel off aforementioned masking and it comes out great it feels great"
modelmakers,36gxb3,Anonieme_Angsthaas,1 point,Tue May 19 14:38:58 2015 UTC,"You'll get to do the fun stuff called 'Canopy Masking'   IMHO it's simpler and more straightforward than masking tracks. Let aside specialized products such as pre-cut masks, you can simply strap some masking tape on the cutting mat, draw some lines with you xacto knife and form squares and triagles and then start patchworking the canopy.  Cockpit is easy to mask in WWII planes (i masked an primed my Fw-190 last weekend), 2 pieces of maskig tape and a blade to trim the edges are usually more than enough (modern fighters have ejection seats that are higher than the cockpit line).  This is probably because i've build more aircrafts than tanks, but links/tracks have always been something to fear, at least for me"
modelmakers,36gxb3,ionizzatore,2,Tue May 19 15:15:23 2015 UTC,"For me, cutting masks to fit the frames drives me up the wall at times. Especially in 1/72 scale. And I tend to avoid tank kits with link-and-length tracks, plus I check reviews before I buy kits with only individual track links. If they have too much pin marks on the tracks I'm not buying it. I really don't have much time to build stuff, so when I get to building something I want it to be a pretty easy build. I don't want to spend nights getting rid of pin marks, excessive flash or fitting problems.  I made that mistake one with my 1/16 Tiger I which has +/- 180 links that have three pin marks each. And they are joined together with metal pins. And around 60% of the holes in the tracks are too small, so I need to drill them. So that Tiger I is now gathering dust on the 'To-Do Shelf'.."

modelmakers,36gxb3,ionizzatore,1 point,Tue May 19 14:56:54 2015 UTC,"Was that the old style where you had to crimp the track links together?  Those did suck.  The newer ones with the wire are much easier.  I don't usually have to do much cleanup on them as far as flash, except occasionally the holes for the wire.  I usually spin a drill bit through it and use a proper straight pin rather than the wire.  I do about 10-20 at a time while watching TV.  Got it down to a science now.  For track without support rollers, they can't be beat as far as drooping properly.  And for that loose track mounted on the tank, they look great (and they always have plenty of extra track links).  The AFV Club plastic workable track fit together somewhat easier, but take more cleanup due to release pin marks."
modelmakers,36gxb3,RonPossible,1 point,Tue May 19 15:36:05 2015 UTC,"New style, the problem is that i had to manually ""refine"" the hole for the link connection of every single link, twice (rear and front).  I had no problem with my Tungusa's tracks (248 links, 2 parts for every link), it was not funny but it was simply a matter of ""grab, cut 5 gates, clean 5 gates, put link in a tray, repeat"". Friulmodel tracks are not simply ""unfunny"", they are ""tedious"" (at least for me)"

modelmakers,36gr8m,Xaphoon,4,Tue May 19 07:09:45 2015 UTC,"Matt and glossy paints scatter light in different ways, matt paint scatters light all around, glossy paint have act more like ""mirrors"".  This means:    Painting a glossy clear over a matt paint will darken the color and enhance the contrast little bit. Think a little bit like the difference between a dry and a wet cloth. Painting a matt clear over a glossed paint (matt + gossy clear + matt clear) will partially ""revert"" the effect, reducing the darkness and smoothing the contrast a little bit Painting a glossy clear over a glossy color will not change the way it scatters the light Painting a matt clear over a matt paint will ""ehnahce"" the scatter so much that you risk to obtain a ""dusty"" aspect   But keep in mind that:   matt colors tend to dry a little bit faster and they offer a better ""grip"" to other layers of paint glossy paint is required for decals.   In the beginning i preferred matt paint, but now i'm more inclined to use semigloss/gloss paint, but since they dry slower i have to wait a lot of time before i can mask them with masking tape, or the tape will ruin the paintjob.  What brand of paint are you going to buy? Paintbrush or airbrush?"
modelmakers,36gr8m,ionizzatore,1 point,Tue May 19 10:55:17 2015 UTC,"Wow, I knew about glossy for decals/wash but after that I thought it was a case of shiny or dull otherwise. I guess its the type of thing you get a feel for after a while. I'd like to build ten of the same model to try out different techniques.   I'm going to get a few aerosols for the major parts and paintbrush the smaller bits. If I stick with it I'll look at getting an airbrush in six months or a year.  Thanks for the help."
modelmakers,36gr8m,ionizzatore,4,Tue May 19 12:12:08 2015 UTC,"As a reference, take a look at this:   Matt color (base) Gloss coat + light matt coat   As you can see the light blue (that was already glossy) did not change a lot, gray and blue (matt) shifted toward a darker tone.  I do not have any photo before the matt coat, but the reflection was similar to the reflection on the top (behind the cockpit) of the first photo or the canopy in the last photo. Matt coat helped to soften the reflections and as you can see the reflection of the ligthbox changed into a lighter shade of paint instead of crisp lines"
modelmakers,36gr8m,Abe-Mango,2,Tue May 19 12:21:55 2015 UTC,"The texture of the paints are different. Generally, matte coats are rougher than gloss coats. This affects things like decals sticking to the paint and how paints act when applied in layers. You should usually apply decals after a gloss varnish and anything like panel-lines should be done with gloss paint."

modelmakers,36glbs,Destructias_Warlord,3,Tue May 19 08:35:29 2015 UTC,"Usually if you know what model you are buying, you can search the manufacturer's page for the building instructions for it, as those provide the colours needed.  Generally you will ""need"" about 10 colours maximum for each model, with most of the getting repetitive if you dedicate yourself to one era/theme, and half of them being the ""close-enough-use-it-anyways"" colours like aluminium/polished steel or the odd colours like yellow, blue etc for markings."
modelmakers,36glbs,Rahana101,3,Tue May 19 08:43:48 2015 UTC,"Another useful reference is this store: http://www.1999.co.jp/eng/ (mildly NSFW on the front page) - along with each kit they also have scanned instructions which includes paint guides.  Personally I usually decide beforehand which scheme I'd like to do and then check which model paints correspond to that scheme. For instance, a Battle of Britain Spitfire - do I have a Dark Green, Dark Earth and Sky? That's what's really important, not which paints the kit manufacturer recommends. For aircraft, cockpit colour is also important. Each kit maker have either his own brand or a deal with at specific paint maker, which means for instance that a Tamiya kit might recommend a paint mix of three different pots to get a specific shade - when that colour is available directly from another paint manufacturer. If you know that the Tamiya mix tries to replicate for instance Interior Green, you can try to find that instead."

Depending on where you live and how long you want to wait I'd send Airfix an e-mail about it.   If you don't wanna go down that route (mustbuildnow!!!) try to gently force it together. Glue down just as much that's needed for the fuselage to stay together.    Test fit the canopy and other connecting parts to make sure they fit before finally glueing the two halves together.

They did this with the Legends of Aviation 8th AF B-17/P-47/P-51 kit I did a few months back, too. It drives me absolutely crazy. I tend to love doing Revell kits but this paint mixing idea they've got isn't working well and they need to just list the colors we need. The pictures on the box showed a 70/71 model but a 90/10 mix of gray/green won't make either of those, as far as I can imagine. I did find a profile in a book of one that had a gray and green scheme, however the gray looked more like a grauviolett and I was reluctant to go that far."

modelmakers,368y4a,MadMorf,3,Mon May 18 01:30:05 2015 UTC,"A lot of the models that Adam is doing do not call for really fine detail work that is to be done with an airbrush. He's working with large areas of color and generally in a larger scale as well.  However, what he says still applies to modeling as we know it. 90% of paintjobs totally can be applied with a simple, single-action airbrush every bit as well as, if not better than, a dual-action brush. If you know your brush inside and out and you have your paint thinner perfectly and your air pressure dialed in perfectly, you can actually spray very fine lines with a single-action brush, as well. It's just easier doing detail work like feathered color demarcations and especially effects like the mottled camouflage present on WW2 Luftwaffe subjects with a dual-action brush. But really, those constitute a tiny fraction of the sum of all of the paintjobs you have to do on any model.  I use an Iwata dual-action airbrush for everything but I only ever REALLY need it when I'm doing fine work."

So far I already learned that you do not glue in props with engine until the very last moment, fortunately I managed not to glue on wheels just yet so I don't have to mask that much.  I completely ignored any cockpit preshading and weathering, luckily it's so small scale I can get away with it I guess. Canopy is destroyed by glue marks - suffice to say since then I acquired canopy glue and better tools to handle the fitting.  I tried preshading panel lines, well it didn't really provide the sufficient result so I scraped most of it and will go for wash after it's painted.  At the moment I am about to coat it with first coat of RLM 76 so I can add the splinter camo on the top tomorrow.  Any comments and hints, critique etc are most welcome, as I am about to delve into the Eastern Front Groupbild with Revell Panther Ausf. G in 1/72"
modelmakers,369d2z,alaskafish,2,Sun May 17 13:24:29 2015 UTC,"Are you using an airbrush? Because if you aren't, then don't pre-shade. Pre-shading only works with an airbrush because you need those faint edges.   Also, if you're brush painting, you don't need to masking everything. Unless you really don't feel comfortable with not touching the glass, or the propeller.   For the canopy, You can just tear the canopy off. Then, paint the interior. Doesn't need to be a good job on the interior, just enough so you understand there's stuff going on.   But if you want to defog the canopy, you can sand off the defogged areas of the canopy (but for good measure just sand the whole thing) with some fine sand paper or a sanding stick, and then dip it in some Klear/Future Floor Wax (acrylic floor wax) and let it cure. The floor wax will coat the canopy and fix all the imperfections from the sanding.  From now on, I suggest you glue the canopy  with just normal Elmers glue. It tries clear, and doesn't fog."

As for the canopy, I will try tearing it off as soon as I demask it, sand it down and I'll try to get some acrylic floor wax somewhere :)"

modelmakers,3685md,sleepwalker77,3,Sun May 17 02:31:16 2015 UTC,"It won't hurt your decals. Apply gloss first to seal the decals, then apply the flat finish last. This helps hide the decal edges."

modelmakers,366ysu,darkrift5,4,Sat May 16 19:34:23 2015 UTC,"There's multiple ways to prime for alclad depending on what type of finish you are going for.  For a chrome / very shiny finish indeed you will want to use a glossy black color. I myself prefer to use Tamiya X-1 Gloss Black. Thin it a lot, so that it is something like 20-30% paint to thinner. I use lacquer thinner (Mr. Color) to thin it, but Tamiya makes their own lacquer thinner for their paints as well. Spray it on in very light, thin coats and slowly build it up to a very high gloss shine.   The advantage of using an alcohol-based acrylic like Tamiya vs. an enamel is that it dries / cures much faster. In fact with it thinned the way I spray it, it dries almost instantly to the touch.   Once I have the gloss painted, I use some fine grit polishing liquid and rub it down just to make sure the surfaces are completely flat and glossy for the highest shine.   You could also use a simply gloss clear paint like Tamiya X-22 if you want a less shiny base for the alclad. In fact I've seen people simply cover bare plastic with X-22 and then sprayed the Alclad ontop of that.  I wouldn't recommend spraying something over your gloss black though. Just get some polishing fluid (high grit) and a polishing cloth and rub it down with your hands to make sure its a good surface for alclad."

modelmakers,366ysu,Dr_Von_Spaceman,2,Sat May 16 22:20:25 2015 UTC,"If you're talking about the Alclad metal lacquer itself, no. For one thing, it goes on so very thin that you're not building up a lot of solvents on your base color. Use 2-3 very light coats. Don't try to ""paint it metal"" all at once or you'll lose the high-polish finish. Think ""tint"" more than ""paint"" when you're spraying it."

modelmakers,362f1f,solipsistnation,1 point,Fri May 15 21:09:44 2015 UTC,"Yes. When models are cast in plastic, they spray the mold with a substance called ""mold release"" that helps keep the freshly-cast sprue from sticking to the mold. If there's any still on the plastic, it will keep paint from sticking well. Also, as you handle the model oil from your hands gets onto the plastic and also can make it so paint doesn't stick well.   You can also just wash your model off in water, but then you need to make sure it dries quickly. Rubbing alcohol would evaporate really quickly so you wouldn't have to wait overnight or whatever..."

modelmakers,3633ju,matt3o,3,Fri May 15 18:13:24 2015 UTC,"Nice rigor and a great lets-try-it attitude! If I may offer a small bit of advice (as I learned through my own Misadventures in Modellingtm ):   Last test with Softer underneath and Setter to seal the decal.   Setter helps the decal to stick, softener helps the decal to hug. You should use the setter underneath the decal. Here is my process:   use a fine cloth (I use a microfiber cloth) to buff the target area bathe the target area in setting solution place decal and position (if you use lots of setter it's easier to reposition the decal as it floats on the setter) remove the excess setting solution give it 2-5 minutes to dry, then hit it with the softener. I tend to 'paint' two generous coats of softener with a minute of dry time in between leave it overnight to dry seal in decals with clear coat of your choice (gloss, matte, Finish, whatever) weather   I learned this the hard way while trying to position a decal just so with the softener underneath. Soft decals are easy to rip and mess up!"
modelmakers,3633ju,Ghoda,2,Fri May 15 19:02:35 2015 UTC,"Be careful with Mr Setter as either mines gone off or I've got a couple of decals that don't like it.

Now I've been just using water and Mr Softner."

modelmakers,3633ju,Ghoda,1 point,Fri May 15 21:52:25 2015 UTC,I use microset/sol. To be honest I don't see the awesome painted-on look until after I seal it with dullcote (matte clear). Something about a glossy decal that just doesn't look right in my mind
modelmakers,3633ju,mrcoffee83,2,Fri May 15 22:53:06 2015 UTC,i've recently got back into the hobby and am trying a lot of stuff that i initially thought was gimicky  i bought a bottle of micro sol the other week and omfg why didn't i try this sooner?!
modelmakers,3633ju,Anonieme_Angsthaas,1 point,Fri May 15 18:23:57 2015 UTC,"Interesting stuff, this is the most in-depth review of different decal solutions I've seen or read. Too bad you couldn't find Micro Sol/Set because that's what I use, most of the local shops have it, as well as the Vallejo solution. I'd like to see how it compares to Micro Sol/Set. The Mr. Hobby products are hard to find around here, but every shop has the Revell decal solution.   I'll probably steal your idea and do a comparison between Vallejo, Micro and Revell one day."
modelmakers,3633ju,JohnBox93,2,Fri May 15 19:39:05 2015 UTC,"Is micro sol basically the same stuff as humbrols decal fix, that's the stuff I'm using and it seems to work pretty well"
modelmakers,3633ju,Anonieme_Angsthaas,1 point,Fri May 15 21:12:44 2015 UTC,"The difference between Humbrol Decal fix and Micro Sol is that Micro Sol is a two part solution, Micro Sol is applied on the surface of the model, and Micro Set is applied to the decal, and Set is the stuff that actually softens the decal.  Does it matter? I really can't tell you, I've never tried anything else but Micro Sol because that's what the shop had in stock when I bought it."
modelmakers,3633ju,Ghoda,1 point,Fri May 15 21:58:43 2015 UTC,"You have that backwards - Micro Set cuts the surface tension (vacating most of the air under the decal), and slightly softens the decal making it easier to get the decal to conform to curves and irregular surfaces. Once dry, it should be followed by the MicroSol to permanently meld the decal to the model. After letting the decal dry, check for air pockets/bubbles, pop them with a pin or a fresh blade in your knife and add more MicroSol, repeat this until the decal looks like it's part of the paint.  You can use MicroSol by itself but it's way harder to position the decal as you have about 20 seconds before the decal starts to get really soft."

When I started it, I was really hoping it would be show worthy when done. A few very minor things, and a very major decal SNAFU, undid those dreams. The kit itself was by all accounts a joy to build. Things fit precisely and were well-engineered. The decals were awful though. Large curved decals covering the entire airframe are not fun, and these wanted to tear with little effort. Even when they went on well, they wrinkled as they set despite use of MicroSet (MicroSol shattered them).  Playing around with the camera tonight, I think I got some pretty good shots of it at least!

Which is good, because when it comes to the Arizona, you have to ask ""Which of the available kits is the least worst?"", rather than which is the best.  The recent Trumpeter 1/200 and decade-old Dragon 1/700 are the most decent. Both have accuracy issues, but at least the plastic and detailing are better than the other options, which are the venerable Revell 1/426 from the 60s, and the MiniHobby Models/Banner/Hobby Boss 1/350 and 1/700 kits, both based on upscaling or downscaling the old Revell kit. There's also a Revell 1/720 one, but that's just as bad a choice.   From a quick Google, it seems there actually is an Arizona in the Starblazers series, but it bears very little resemblance to BB-39 except for the shape of the turrets - it even only has three turrets instead of four!   To keep the essence of Arizona in your space battleship, I'd maintain the following elements: four triple-gun turrets, a blunt hull with stepped areas where you'd put casemate guns, a central citadel well medium-calibre weapons in casemates, two tripod masts, aircraft facilities at the stern and/or on top of turret 3, and a single straight funnel. Everything beyond that you can alter to make more ""spacey"" without hurting the overall essence of what gives the Pennsylvania class their post-modernization appearance."

The damm thing had rifling.. because space guns need rifling.    Looking at some pics of the Arizona, I'll lose all the those life boats, and maybe add some more fighters there in the middle.  Probably lose the smaller, open air, guns.  Maybe fabricate some sort of ball turrets.  Gotta add some thing to the bottom of the hull... Fibre optic lights in all the portholes... This is gonna take a while to figure out.  I guess the best thing to do is to start by getting a kit, and looking at it.  I found a great comparison pic between the real Yamoto and the Star Blazers version.  http://www.shipschematics.net/yamato/images/edf/yamato_comparison.jpg"

modelmakers,35zntw,Plundersquirrel,3,Thu May 14 21:20:37 2015 UTC,"The yellow base color with green/red areas was standardized on Feb 18th, 1943. New vehicles coming from the factory as well as units in the field were painted that way starting then. So, depending on what era you're looking to depict, the proper camo could be either.  Only the early models would have been gray, so I suspect the yellow scheme would be more appropriate for your mid production vehicle.  That said, paint it pink if you want. It's your model. :)  As to the airbrush issue, I'd still give the yellow scheme a go. There is a shocking amount of variation in camo schemes even after the order for standardization came out. Get creative and you'll probably be just fine."

modelmakers,35xr1m,windupmonkeys,3,Fri May 15 04:26:39 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't say butthurt, really. Setting up and maintaining the mold is actually the most expensive part of creating the kit, like, bloody expensive compared to rest of the process - design the mold, test the mold, keep back-up molds, replace mold after X uses etc... If they were ordered by someone to just ""hand them over"" and there was no possibility of cashing out on that transaction, I can completely understand why they destroyed it instead of helping their competition with the hardest part of manufacturing process, for free."
modelmakers,35xr1m,cacheflow,1 point,Fri May 15 11:12:40 2015 UTC,"With good reason. It's a lucrative license. While the new Bandai models seem to be quite good from what the reviews both in the press and on forums say, it's a snap kit, which makes it less of a builder's kit.   Bandai probably sold the execs doing the licensing on the idea that as a global toymaker and distributor, they could reach far more people and more money. The result is a very good kit that modelers like, but which at the end of the day, is still a snap kit that trades complexity of assembly (which some people like) for accessibility.   Further, why help your conglomerate of a competitor? Unless it was flatly illegal for them to destroy the molds (which it apparently wasn't), it makes good sense not to hand one of your largest competitors those super expensive molds. Bandai wants to take the license and cut in? Fine, spend the money and make your own. Of course, that probably means if at any point Finemolds wants to subcontract for Bandai, they've just burned some bridges, but Finemolds is a pretty small operation in comparison, so perhaps the owner just has a sense of personal pride on the line.    Not sure if the rumor is true though. Assuming there's no law to the contrary, the Star Wars IP lawyers messed up on this one or drafted the license agreement poorly, such that Finemolds felt that it could destroy the molds without having to pay up (it's not clear; there may be a local rule in Japan that says tools like this are the property of the creator, but the IP behind the object being rendered is not). But then again, I don't know exactly what goes into these licensing agreements, so the molds might belong to finemolds, but the IP obviously belongs to Disney. My guess would be that Lucasfilm never cared about this because model kits since the 90s (until the recent revival and lower tooling costs) the model kit market is for old fogeys and adults, not children, (unless it's a snap kit, which came out around the time of the new movies), so model kits are just small potatoes not worth the bother."
modelmakers,35xr1m,GT86,5,Wed May 20 22:41:59 2015 UTC,"As /u/GT86 said, Bandai is probably your best bet right now.  I bought the AT-ST kit a few weeks back, and it seems like really good quality.  I'll keep you posted when I build it.  Also, although most of the Revell kits on the market today are Snap Together, they are planning on releasing a number of new kits to coincide with the new movie later this year, and they aren't all SnapKits.

The paint coats more evenly than if I had hand-painted it and the lines come out clean. It takes a bit of work but the payout is much better. Truthfully I think I only spent about 2 hours on masking. For the main canopy I'd run a strip down an entire row of windows, then just cut out the framework with an X-acto knife.  /u/Duke_of_Fritzburg is right though - pre-cut masks rule.

Revel sells a 1/72 U-boat for I think $150 and I remember seeing a 1/72 destroyer for $250.   Scale models are not great for RC boat building since they're not weighted to scale... I suggest if you really must get a model, yourobably want to get a 1/72 scaled BPB or torpedo boat. They're small enough to be cheap, but large enough to fit servos and all that good stuff.

modelmakers,35x2cb,JohnBox93,2,Thu May 14 20:15:31 2015 UTC,"Most 1/96 and similarly-scaled ship models are either scratchbuilt or from semi-kits that come with a hull and some of the superstructure - you'll have to source fittings from other aftermarket manufacturers, usually. These are not cheap because of the low market demand and high development costs. Here is one forum post that has a list of some suppliers of large-scale ship model items, from hulls to photoetched brass to fittings. The ""Hulls and Fittings"" heading is probably the best place to start looking.  Some outfits from China, such as ArkModel, has all-inclusive kits (except for the RC part, which is optional), but as you can see, they run in the $1000 range.   A more affordable option would be one of the new Trumpeter 1/200 battleships. Around 3-4 feet long for the longer ships, they're still pool-worthy and can work on a calm pond."

A little lacking in some details, and they could have at least included the side-skirts that many late-model jagdpanzer IVs had. It's also really nice that you don't have to glue together the top and bottom parts of the hull, makes it a lot easier to get on the tracks once you have them painted separately.  That said, it wouldn't have killed Tamiya to actually make an interior for the kit, and they also decided to not include the interior breech of the gun and instead want to charge extra for it, along with a metal barrel. Don't get me wrong, I love Tamiya, but companies like Dragon do this for free at nearly the same price as a Tamiya kit, and they often include photo etch as well.

For cars and tanks, Tamiya is a good, safe, starting point. It kind of depends on what you want to build though. Different manufacturers might have newer, more detailed molds of a specific subject where as some ""good"" manufacturers might still be using an old mold of that subject. If you have a specific car, helicopter, or tank in mind, I (or someone else I'm sure) would be happy to help!  http://scalemates.com/ Scalemates is a great database resource for finding kits of a subject and seeing timelines of when molds were produced or re-tooled.

modelmakers,35wogw,Slukaj,2,Thu May 14 21:40:39 2015 UTC,"+1 to /u/LemonGear's suggestion of Tamiya. They know how to build solid kits with good instructions that are relatively highly detailed.  Once you build one or two of those and get a feel for what the heck is going on, most of the other major brands will be similar enough for you to figure out without much issue.  Stay away from Dragon tanks until you're comfortable with military models. Manually constructed tracks are a pain in the ass.   For tanks and other ground equipment/personnel, 1/35 is what you want. For planes, I prefer 1/48 as they're larger than their 1/72 counterparts and a bit easier to build and see."

LEDs that come with the kit.) but can be difficult for begginers. Also gets pricey.   Dragon. Same as Meng.(Without the gimmicks) But they have a line that is easy to build without sacrificing too much detail. (Smart kit)  Airfix. Great detail aircraft. Watch out for their older kits though.

The Elefant has been a real barrel of fun though.... my first armor build was submitted 4 months ago... so I've been working on this longer than that. The problem is that I didn't know what I was doing then and assembled the whole tank, and primered it, before even thinking about the tracks, which are link and length. 4+ months later though, I've finished a side http://i.imgur.com/NCLryeQ.png!

I've spent the last 7-10 days fighting a decal disaster, to the point that I considered ditching them altogether and painting the X-29 in fictional operational military markings (not an original idea, but a solution to my problem). I experimented with printing my own decals via laser printer, but those looked worse than the kit decals despite being easier to apply. In the end, I wound up applying the decals as per design despite wrinkles, cracks, and misalignment issues caused by the crappy kit decals. I touched them up by hand and called it done. The decals are probably about a C+ effort on a model that was otherwise coming out a B+/A- overall. It's a pisser, but there's not much I could do about it.   Pictures tomorrow upon completion."

modelmakers,35v3km,Plundersquirrel,2,Thu May 14 04:16:26 2015 UTC,"Airfix make 1/72 aircraft and armour that is very cheap, and a good introduction. The older sprues are lower quality, but newer ones are better. They can be found for around £6 on Amazon UK, and although I'm not sure about elsewhere, I'd imagine they'd be cheap in other countries too. Airfix 1/72 stuff comes with a paint guide in the package which includes the right coloured paints from the Humbrol range, which are very cheap paints and have a wide variety of colours. Also, due to the fact that they're in a small scale, there is less detail and they're quicker to build.  As for easy Airfix models, just pick any 1/72 armour you like, as they're generally easier to build and require less paint than aircraft, and aircraft can be more fiddly. Ofc you can try aircraft if you like, they're not that much harder. I can recommend Airfix Spitfires, especially the Mk. I and Mk. IX, as they're cheap and good quality (newer molds).  Don't expect it to be brilliant, as it is your first model (my first models were terrible), but just have fun with it.  You will need a small knife (Stanley knifes are sufficient, but X-Acto knifes are best), some model cement (sort of like glue) and some brushes.  As for resources, I'd you're weathering etc. pictures are generally a very good guide, as are other people's models.  If you have any other questions, please ask, we're happy to help!

Here's how I do it: Preshading - coloring - first clear coat gloss - decals - second clear coat gloss (or semigloss) - weathing, e.g. washing - third layer of clear coat.    So to answer directly to your question: you do it between two layers of clear coat. First layer of gloss clear coat provides a better surface for your decals and prevent silvering. The second layer seals the decals. Now you can apply the weathering to an even surface, without getting the fluid soaked under the decals or similar flaws.    Then you seal you weathering with a final clear coat. I've also heard of people who do not seal the weathering, because they wanted to be able to clean it off and redo it in the future.    Preshading is also a technique of weathing, which is applied before any clear coats."
modelmakers,35tf5u,FlyingLowSH,3,Wed May 13 11:20:09 2015 UTC,"Conventional wisdom says to do washes after a gloss clear, because the smooth glossy surface promotes the wash flowing into the nooks and crannies.  It also helps protect the paint underneath from the solvents in the wash.  Michael Rinaldi, however, never uses a clear coat of any kind."
modelmakers,35tf5u,Gewehr43,2,Wed May 13 11:20:15 2015 UTC,"Exactly, washes and weathering can be applied on a matt surface, but you will obtain a different effect. As long as you know how the weathering will turn out and you are looking for that specific effect, a matt base is ok"

modelmakers,35tf5u,Gewehr43,1 point,Wed May 13 17:26:27 2015 UTC,"Enamel washes are fine.  I've used them a few times, but prefer oil washes as a matter of personal taste.  The key point to remember is that the base coat paint and gloss coats must not react with the solvent in the wash.  That is, if you use acrylic paints and an acrylic gloss coat (Future/Pledge, etc) don't use an acrylic for your wash.  The solvent in the wash will attack the base and gloss coats.  Enamel or oil washes should be used with acrylic base/clears so that you don't damage the underlying finish while applying the wash."
modelmakers,35tf5u,ionizzatore,1 point,Wed May 13 17:58:08 2015 UTC,Hmm I may have to buy some oil paints then. I do my gloss coat with future floor polish and I don't think I would be able to use an enamel wash on that.

I painted it with a single coat of bright blue modeling lacquer (unprimed of course), which very quickly peeled off.   I can look at those photos and think “Oh yeah, that part there!” Like that radiator hose, it would keep coming off. And the hood louvers (not shown in the photos) all came off because I used styrene solvent on chrome-plated plastic and metal - pretty much no adhesive effect there.

Second, it took me 3-4 coats of it to get something that even resembled a gloss coat and I was very unsure of the results or how to clear coat it until you responded.  Third, it's messy and sticky. It seemed like every hair or dust particle within the vicinity was attracted to it and that bothered me. I didn't have that trouble with regular paint in an airbrush, regular brush, or rattle can.  Granted, I don't have a paint booth but I do what I can in my space. Ultimately it seems the long way around to do what can already be done with a product with a known ability (dull coat in a rattle can). I did did my clear plastic parts in it, and they turned out great. I will definitely continue that use of future. Finally, and maybe nothing to be concerned about, is that this is not a designed use for future. The manufacturer could change the formula and I could find myself coating a model in the future (assuming I stuck with the future process) with disastrous results.  I'd rather stick with the known knowns, and not the known unknowns (as Donald Rumsfeld once said, or at least something similar)."
modelmakers,35r6s4,ionizzatore,1 point,Wed May 13 06:36:31 2015 UTC,"I recently bought some Humbrol Clear that is said to be the same as Future and tried to use it on some spare canopy but it did not behave ""as advertised"", a really big drop formed on one side and, as you said, it collected every single particle of dust that was around.  How did you treat the clear part to achieve better results? Did you wash them? Did you shake them from the excess future? I've seen someone suggest to put them on a piece of kitchen paper and at the same time under a plastic glass to protect the part from dust, did you try it?  btw: great work so far, this model is turning out really well!"
modelmakers,35r6s4,ionizzatore,2,Wed May 13 07:29:11 2015 UTC,My method for the canopies was just to briefly submerge them in a bowl of future and put them directly in a piece of tuperware that had a paper towel in the bottom to draw away the excess. I sealed up the Tupperware and let it sit a few days.
modelmakers,35r6s4,MMGeoff,1 point,Wed May 13 15:28:53 2015 UTC,"Thanks, i'll try with one of the spare canopies of my Fw-190."
modelmakers,35r6s4,flounderflound,1 point,Wed May 13 15:39:15 2015 UTC,"Humbrol makes a gloss coat which appears to basically be like Future only designed for models.  You can dip canopies in it as well.  Whenever I spray Future, and I use it on every model, I tend to airbrush it on in a heavy coat. I make sure it goes on looking very wet but of course I stop before it starts developing runs. The self-levelling quality evens everything out so the finish is smooth. If dust is an issue, you can store the model in a container while it dries to keep dust out. If your spraying environment is dusty, I'm of less use to you with advice as it has never been much of an issue for me."

You can find lots of images for just about every subject. Older subjects generally have photos from their original era, as well as modern day photos.. For example, there are tons of photos from places like the Bovington Tank Museum, aviation museums, etc.  When you pick a basic topic, say the F6F Hellcat, be sure to check out the category for it instead of just the basic page.  For example, if you go to the Hellcat page here scroll down to the bottom where you will see the link to the category page for the Hellcat at the very bottom.  The category pages often show many more images than the basic page for it.  You will also then find other categories such as say, F6F warbirds.    Also when you click on a specific image, check out the bottom to see if the image belongs to other categories.  To continue with the Hellcat example, if you look at this image's page, you'll find a link at the bottom to the Evergreen Air and Space Museum where you can find more images from the museum.  I'm a traditional artist (oil paint, pen and ink, etc), as well as a 3D modeler/generalist artist, and Wikimedia Commons is the first place I go to when looking for reference images.  It is very rare that I won't find at least a few very useful images from there.

modelmakers,35ojsh,Plundersquirrel,1 point,Tue May 12 21:41:38 2015 UTC,"Needed stuff: Airbrush or Spray Paint Rock Salt Water Toothbrush Works great with 1/35 Armor If you work with smaller armor, sift it with a mesh to create small chips.  Add your first coat. (Rust or Basecoat of actual thing like a dark color.) Leave it to dry overnight. Take some salt and water and wet the area you are working on. Sprinkle salt little by little on the places you want the base coat to show. The water binds the salt to the model but not too much so you can brush it off later. Wait for the water to dry off so the paint will stick. Then use your airbrush or spray can to add the top layer. Don't mind the salt that fall off as this will add to the effect. Spraying more coats can add a 3D effect to the chipping. Dry it again then brush the salt off with a toothbrush."

Came up with the idea yesterday after leaving the hobby shop with a few new jars of paint and got home and realized I grabbed two that I already had.   This is just a kind of flow chart of how you could search for/manage your kits.   I'm still working on the paint portion, most likely will be broken down by manufacturer, a la iModelKit."
modelmakers,35muac,JoshKerky,4,Mon May 11 20:21:03 2015 UTC,"I think a cool idea would be a barcode scanner/storehouse, so in the store you could just scan the kit you want to buy with the app and it could search and tell you if you own it already or not, also the barcode scan would bring it into the app for your library/stash.   this seems like a really great idea, and I would definitely get it and use it :D"

I was planning on working on this in my off time during my 6 month stint in Japan, seeing as how I use a MacBook Pro as my daily laptop and currently use an IPhone 6, but I was seriously taken back by the cost of the SDK for making an app.  Ideally, and this is just an idea forming in my brain over the course of the day, would be that it could be compatible with both iOS and Droid."
modelmakers,35mix6,irlrnstuff,5,Mon May 11 18:54:11 2015 UTC,"In terms of what I could do better next time;   Need to find something to fill in the gaps at the bottom of the canopy; Need to make sure the painting area is less dusty :) The panel line worked ok (Doesn't really show up in the pics); Need to improve the under carriage detail; Need to apply Pledge more consistently and avoid pooling; Need to thin rear wings as they look a bit clunky and have some gaps; Couple of the transfers went a bit wonky.   This kit with really good fun to put together, hardly any flash and went together with minimal fuss."
modelmakers,35mix6,alaskafish,5,Mon May 11 19:00:06 2015 UTC,"It's great they you were able to learn from this kit without others telling you. Sometimes people refuse to see the wrongs they've done, and when other people tell them, they'll refuse to listen.  But let me help solidify your list.     As for filling gaps. You are correct. You do need to fill and sand. But not only under the canopy. You also need to sand/fill the wing tips. That's just the build of this aircraft, but take that into consideration for next builds. Always a good idea. I'd recommend buying some MIG panel line accents. Sure $5-8 is a lot, but it goes a long way.  I thought the under carriage was okay.  Also a good idea. Good plan. Transfers were a tad bit wonky, nothing too bad. I suggest you put some pledge before you put the decals on. Then when you put the decals on, ontop of the pledge, soften the decal with some decal softener. After that dries, put another coat of pledge. You can read more about decal adhesion and softeners on this sub's wiki, or on the internet.      Overall, great little kit. I really want to build a newly tooled Airfix kit."

modelmakers,35mix6,MMGeoff,2,Mon May 11 20:35:28 2015 UTC,"Other than what alaskafish said: paint the exhausts. My favorite color combination is a base of 50/50 brown/dark iron, then (if you want) some drybrush on the edge of the pipes"
modelmakers,35mix6,3rdCoffee,3,Mon May 11 21:07:50 2015 UTC,"That looks pretty good, I think. If I may:  You still need to paint the wingtip lights, basically every airplane has these. Usually it's a green light on the right side, and a red light on the left side. If you want to be pro, while you're assembling the model, cut out the wingtip light areas with a saw, and superglue chunks of colored plastic (stolen from toothbrushes, for example) into those areas, and sand them into shape. Polish them so they're clear-ish, and mask them off before you paint. If you want to be really really pro, do the same thing, only use chunks of clear plastic with little holes drilled inside and filled with paint to simulate the lightbulb. I can explain this in more detail if you want.  Your panel lines are fine. Generally you don't want the panel lines to be very noticeable or else the model will look really stark and kind of like a technical illustration - although some modellers adopt an intentionally more ""artistic"" style and they like the look of stark panel lines. That's a matter of taste and it's their prerogative if it's what they're going for but I think your lines are not overdone.  The gaps around your canopy can be filled with white glue. When the white glue dries, you can take a moist (not soaked) cotton swab and remove excess glue. If the glue remains visible in the ""gap"" area, you can retouch those areas with a small brush and paint. Nice job painting the canopy by the way, the frames look good and clean. The canopy is a really critical area on an aircraft model, getting it right goes a long way in making the finished model look good.  I see a seam near the tip of the right wing, that's an easy spot to forget about. Also, there's a ghost of a seam running up the length of the nose. I find superglue is the most reliable way to fill seams, they seem to stay filled and invisible under paint.  For the undercarriage, simply adding a brake line made out of solder wire or copper wire will go a long way in adding authenticity to this area.  I also like the weathering on the underside, the smoke stains and grime around the wheel wells look nicely integrated into the rest of the model's finish."

As long as everything is fully cured (different from ""dry,"" curing is a chemical process, in a practical sense it means fully, fully, fully, dry, dry, dry) there shouldn't be problems.  My common sense says that acrylics could go over less than cured enamels because acrylics tend to be a little more gentle while enamels will have harsher chemicals which might eat into acrylics but I could be completely wrong about this. Your safest bet is just to allow adequate drying time."

modelmakers,35nhph,MMGeoff,2,Tue May 12 05:00:31 2015 UTC,"It probably depends largely on the brand/formula, some acrylics are solvent based like Gunze and Tamiya, while others are water based like PollyScale. Others, like Vallejo utilize vinyl pigment, but they might be water based otherwise - I don't know. I'd imagine the water-based acrylics are pretty benign.  Then you can get into lacquer paints, which can destroy anything they touch, however lacquers have extremely fine pigmentation and they can offer an extraordinarily high quality finish."

modelmakers,35nldp,showmethebiggirls,1 point,Tue May 12 00:38:03 2015 UTC,This needs to be considered. Different kits may have different shapes (maybe they are simply more or less accurate) and pe may not fit

Disclaimer: I have never done this with aircraft, only armor.  Do some searches online for reviews/build logs of both kits and the PE set in question.

Great work, there are only a couple of spots that are a little bit ""too weathered"" (where you can clearly see the black wash on the A-36 and the destroyed insigna on the F4), but overall a really nice work."
modelmakers,35k5lo,ionizzatore,2,Mon May 11 11:05:53 2015 UTC,Yeah I thought it looked a little light. It's so hard for me to mix colors properly so it can be hit or miss for me. It looked like the right color until after it dried.
modelmakers,35k5lo,Commanderfox515,2,Mon May 11 16:31:18 2015 UTC,"It looked like the right color until after it dried.   Something similar happens to ""us"" (non colorblind) too: glossy paint changes the tone of the paint (it's darker, it looks ""wet"") and  when you paint a model you have to consider that the glossy clear will darken the color a little bit while enhancing the contrast and matt clear will lighten up the paint a little bit, and sometimes you create the perfect gradient of paint and bham, it's promptly altered by the clear finish.   It happened to my recent cockpit, I created a really nice balance that was flattened and became almost invisible with the satin finish"

Save money and get non-sterile packs."
modelmakers,35m29x,windupmonkeys,1 point,Tue May 12 06:43:10 2015 UTC,"I use Xcel blades and handles as well. More recently, a couple of Fiskars handles came into the house, those are a little heavier and they have a rubberized grip but I don't consider them an improvement over an all-metal Xcel handle.  Xcel blades are cheap and they don't last that long, but like I said, they're cheap.  Some people absolutely swear by scalpels, however. I have a scalpel as well but I don't think I've yet figured out how to properly change blades and since the usual X-acto knives have served me well I'm not particularly motivated learning how to use scalpels. They do seem to remove plastic more slowly than X-acto blades and I would imagine the blades themselves are manufactured to a higher quality standard so they probably last longer.  Why do you have to go with Amazon, are there no good craft stores near where you live?"
modelmakers,35m29x,MMGeoff,1 point,Tue May 12 04:58:21 2015 UTC,"I would recommend against Xacto. They have market penetration in America and everyone uses them, but they're not all that good really. They'll do the job, but there are better blades out there. I would recommend Swann Morton. They're scalpels, not hobby knives and the difference is very noticeable. Huge range of blade shapes and handles, but this would be a good place to start. Get a few 5 packs of blades to try out and once you find a style you like get a box of 100 in that style. Should be £10-£15 for a 100."
modelmakers,35kti6,Rahana101,4,Mon May 11 08:56:53 2015 UTC,"Thinner would react negatively to that polystyrene box. Any solvent based thinner/ paint can melt and eat away at that box. Lacquer will definitely corrode that thing in a heartbeat. You're better off using a box container made out of ABS plastic which will be more sturdy and probably costs the same.   Not to mention the occasional clean-up job that you will need to do. Spray booths, while intentionally meant to be dirty, still need to be cleaned up on occasion to keep the vent fan in tip top shape and all that excess paint can accumulate and find it's way into your next build project potentially ruining it. Polystyrene is porous and is a pain to clean."

Safety is definitely a big concern when spraying enamel paints indoors.  Getting a safe setup for spraying toxic paints will cost a decent amount.  corners can be cut to save some money, but i don't think your long term health is worth sacrificing.    so you can buy a good set up if you want to spend the cash for one. or you can cut corners and risk some dangerous side effects.  a third option is to convert to acrylics.  it doesn't cost much to get a dozen or so colors maybe around 30$ us.  its cheaper than a ventilation set up and it doesnt stink up your home.  it also doesn't require a big/complicated set up."
modelmakers,35kti6,JohnBox93,1 point,Mon May 11 13:37:49 2015 UTC,"I don't think how it would be unsafe or cutting corners - it's a solid booth that will have ventilation installed (got a buddy planning to re-do their bathroom so there's a free ventilator); as far as the exhaust system goes, flexi tube going out of the appartment doesn't really seem like anything endangering health. That explained, are there any safety/health risks I fail to see and account for?  Converting to acrylics is not really an option at the moment. Got quite a good range of enamels and converting to acrylics on the spot will not cut it in home budget, as it's not just paints, it's thinners, cleaners etc (basically the only available colours in the area are Revells, mostly enamels but eshops are stocked with Acrylics too) - and even with those paints I will want to have some sort of spray booth so I don't accidentaly damage/spray surroundings, be it outside or inside, so the only difference acrylics are making is the importance of good ventilation.   TL;DR: I am not sure what risks did I overlooked and while I plan to convert to acrylics in good time, I will still want a spray booth set up for them too."

There are plenty of ways to make home made spray booths and they should be safe to use.  but the Styrofoam cooler and bathroom vent+tube doesn't sound like the best idea.  a more sturdy set up could be made from a tougher plastic for fairly cheap.  bathroom vent fans shouldn't be very expensive if you pick one up from a hardware store.  im sure all of that would run less than 50$.  even then 50$ would get you alot of acrylic paints and thinners, and none of the hassle of the enamel set up.  Im not trying to rain on your parade at all. i just want you to be safe, so you can enjoy the hobby well into old age.  acrylics are not as messy as you might think.  i just use a protective mat that keeps my bench paint free.  other than that, the paint only goes where you spray it.

modelmakers,35iza3,Duke_of_Fritzburg,1 point,Sun May 10 21:16:10 2015 UTC,"Not necessarily easier to brush. With thinner, its easy enough (for me) to brush on. I am more trying to manipulate the paint while shading (similar to the drying of oil paints) to get desired look/effect. I am working on human figures for the first time and skin tones are tough for me. Plus, I don't want it to be all one monotone flesh color and some tutorial videos I have seen, the guys all use oils because they take a while to dry and they can blend easier (at least that how it appears and what they describe). I want to continue using acrylics if possible too."
modelmakers,35iza3,harveymushman,2,Sun May 10 23:31:43 2015 UTC,"You're probably not going to be able to emulate the blending qualities of oils by adding a retarder to Tamiya paints. Tamiya paints are not ideal for brush painting to begin with, and it's precisely the slow drying time and very fine pigmentation that allows oil paints to be blended the way they can be. With Tamiya paints, even with a retarder they'll start drying too quickly. When you lay another coat over a drying coat of paint, you'll pull everything up. Oils feather, Tamiya strips. I don't think you can really put wet paint over wet paint when you use Tamiya like you can with oils - at least I've never had luck doing so.  If you want to brush paint with acrylics I'd ditch Tamiya and use something like Citadel or Vallejo. I know from experience that Citadel paints are a lot more brush-friendly, and everybody else raves about Vallejo although I've never tried them myself.  It is possible to get very smooth transitions and color gradients with acrylics but different techniques are used to achieve those results. I can't really give you much in the way of advice in brush painting techniques other than repeat what's already been said about looking up tutorials."
modelmakers,35iza3,tankbuster183,1 point,Mon May 11 05:18:48 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your response. You're the second person to recommend Vallejo paints. I started with cars/motorcycles and really liked the tamiya paints for those models (also had a decent collection of colors built up by now).. I don't really do figures but I've started to and I think Vallejo might be the way to go. You are right as well with regards to technique/layering of acrylics (versus ""blending"" like oils). I did get the impression that acrylics with retarder still wont blend as well as oils will and have seen some good examples of a layering effect - something like what happens here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ESG-d4eB6w Obviously, this guy is a pro and I am nowhere near that level at all but I might go this route for the time being."

Even the guys that get their models put on magazine covers could give you a list of all the mistakes they see in them.  So make sure you just enjoy making the model.

As you build more models you'll barely notice any improvement until you compare your first model with your most recent.  So make sure you crank out as many models as you can, and dont stress the little things.  youll grow faster if you focus on quantity for the first year or so.

I used to brush paint before moving to an airbrush and the key to brush painting is practice and thinning your paints with a suitable thinner.  For finding what paints to use, try Google as there are lots of blogs etc.  Online shopping is a great way of getting paints your local supplier doesn't have.   As for your sprue dramas there is a series on YouTube by international scale modeller that covers the basics to some of the most advanced techniques.  Tldr. YouTube and Google are your friend."
modelmakers,35h9sq,Cheezfriend,3,Sun May 10 11:35:35 2015 UTC,Thin your paint. Do this on a palette. I use the bottom of a cat food tin or an old saucer from the thrift shop. Do NOT get thinner in the paint jar or it will have a very short shelf life. Stir your paint. Shaking just doesn't get the job done. Yes. Most countries only used a handful of different colors at different times and models will have instructions on which paint to use. Sometimes they are quite specific and other times they are vague. It's not to hard to figure out  though. Don't twist the parts off the sprue. Get a pair of side cutters made for the job or do what I do. Use toe nail cutters.
modelmakers,35h9sq,Duke_of_Fritzburg,3,Sun May 10 11:36:09 2015 UTC,"1) If the paint seems thick/grainy you need to thin it out. Use paint thinner/mineral spirits to thin out enamel paints (Testors for example) and water can be used to thin out acrylic paints (Tamiya and Vallejo for example).  2) Personally what I like to do to find paint colors is to load a picture of what I'm building into http://scalemodeldb.com/paint . This website allows you to click colors on an image or manually input colors that it will then match to to model paints. You can also filter it to only show certain brands, types, or sheens (matte vs gloss)  I don't have anything to say for #3 unfortunately because I still have that problem myself :/"
modelmakers,35h9sq,Pokemonprime,3,Sun May 10 11:36:10 2015 UTC,"thin your paints.  it is difficult to learn exactly the right ratios.  youtube is a fantastic source of information about thinning paints for model making specificallycheck out this channel for some great info  If you are brush painting check out this channel .  As far as the grainy bits in the paint, you can filter your paint through a scrap of womens hosiery.  im sure there are a few filter systems available through paint manufacturers if you want something more sophisticated, but the cheap way works just fine. for a person just starting out, i would point you towards acrylic paints.   they are safer to use and easier to clean up.  the sidebar has a great reference for the beginning modeler in its Wiki and Modelers toolbox. You will want to get your hands on a sprue cutter.  its basically a small flush cutter.  it makes clipping parts from the sprue a dream come true.  it is one of the most important peices of gear for a modeler, its not expensive either.  youll find them for about 5$ us. don't be shy about asking anything.

modelmakers,35h9sq,LJIGaming,1 point,Sun May 10 16:02:24 2015 UTC,"What's already been said is good advice. Thin your paint if you feel it's too thick. It will be a little transparent but you'll just have to add multiple coats. I assume you're brush painting? Also, make sure you stir your paints very thoroughly every time before you paint with them.  When you buy a new model, have a look at what colors are ""required"" to paint it with (the instructions will tell you) and buy the paints necessary. In time, you'll have a collection of paint and a sense of what colors tend to be used for what projects. There is also a vast wealth of information about colors on the internet, so just do some looking around.  Delicate parts can be removed from the sprue with a razor saw as well. This is just a fine-toothed hand saw that has uses in woodworking as well so you should be able to find them at an appropriate store. When you're cleaning up the stub of plastic left over, you can support the part with flat-nosed tweezers and work slowly and carefully - as you know those small pieces are very easy to break. You need to find a way to prevent them from bending while you're sanding, and you do that by immobilizing the part somehow.  For general parts removal, if you're not using anything other than a dedicated sprue cutter like this or this, you need to invest in one immediately. You can remove the parts from the sprue with a hobby knife but you're really running a big risk of damaging the parts. Twisting the parts off manually is an absolute no-no. I wouldn't recommend toe-nail cutters as someone has mentioned but my grandfather who built models for 50 years used them on occasion. They just seem awkward to me, and any really big sprue attachment points can be dealt with using a razor saw."
modelmakers,35fzdy,GirlParts,6,Sat May 9 23:59:12 2015 UTC,"Double up on the newspaper, thin paint likes to soak through that 60gsm paper. Especially if you're using solvent based paint. I use an old cutting mat since it protects the surface of my table and can take most solvents without turning into goo :) Thinning the paint is recommended. It's not always required, but I find that even airbrush ready paint needs to be thinned in order to atomise properly. Clean with a good cleaner. You can of course use solvents (IPA, laquer thinner) but Vallejos cleaner works wonders on almost all types of paint. In between paint changes I usually fill my (5ml) cup half full with  1:1 cleaner:water and shoot through. When it's necessary to disassemble the airbrush to get rid of stoppages I use undiluted cleaner.  Fill the cup 1/3s, clean it out with some paper towel. Dump any excess (since its filled with fibres from the towel and pieces of dried up paint). Remove the needle, wipe it off. Put it in again and shoot 1/3 of a cup filled with cleaner through it. Now you can put it away for the week/end. Cleaning is something you will spend a lot of time doing the first year, then it gradually gets less and less since you do it more or less on routine.  Learn how to disassemble your airbrush and how to clean it. The time spent learning the ins and outs pays off later. When I started using an airbrush I used an old cardboard box to catch any overspray. I do recommend some PPE though, like a half mask or a spray booth. Mostly because it sucks getting off from a long session with the airbrush and noticing that the ""non toxic"" acrylics makes your lungs ache. That dust is bad for your lungs, toxic or not. The thing I wish I did before starting to paint was to practice on an old model or piece of non absorbent material. It takes some time to learn the airbrush, usually a bit longer than you think. Oh, thin your paint. I mean really... thin. your. paint. Most problems come from too thick paint in the airbrush. Go thin and use more layers instead of thick and few layers. You will get the hang of ""how thin is thin"" after a while.  It's also good to pick up the habit of cleaning the needle every time you stop spraying. Helps with the nozzle clogging up and you also dont shoot half-dried paint on your model by accident. Just a few more things... ask questions, don't bother with ""recipes"". There are no recipes, there are no set PSI for working with Paint Brand X or Y. Stick to around 10-20 PSI but don't be afraid to up it if you feel the need to.  Oh... last thing. Ask questions! All the time! :)"
modelmakers,35fzdy,pxpxpx,3,Sun May 10 00:35:20 2015 UTC,"Great advice, especially on cleaning. Everyone seems to have a variation on the same routine, but paint doesn't actually go touch many spots on the airbrush, so having a routine that concentrates on the key parts really helps."
modelmakers,35fzdy,Camarupim,3,Sun May 10 18:56:35 2015 UTC,"Newspaper:   If its the best you can do, for now, newspaper should be fine.  Just make sure its layered enough to keep anything from bleeding through.  I would buy some of that padded poster-board stuff they make for kids school projects.  Its thick enough to take some abuse and the accidental spill.  Cut it to fit the area you are working on and you'll be set for a while without having to replace it.  Thinning:  While not all paints need to be thinned to work through an airbrush, it is almost always a good idea to add some thinner.  That being said, these paints are expensive! 2-3$ for 17ml is not cheap.  So if you have that 3$ bottle of Vallejo, thinning it down by half will make it last about twice as long.  It will also help your airbrush out.  Think of your brush like you think of your cars engine.  You don't want it trying to pump out a thick sludge.  You'll need to experiment quite a bit to get it right.  The ratio of thinner to paint will be different for each brush and paint combo out there.  And make sure your thinner and paint are compatible.  Just because a paint is water based doesn't mean thinning it with water is a good idea.  You don't want to dilute your paints you want to thin them.  Try to stick with the same manufacturer for the thinners. Youtube video about thinning paints  Cleaning:  When you take it out of the box, take it apart.  If you don't know how look it up on you tube, i promise there will be a video of some guy taking it apart and explaining how your specific model airbrush works.  For cleaning i would suggest watching some YouTube videos about it.  I could try to explain it in text if you want, but video will work so much better. how to maintain an airbrush  Suggestions on Protecting the rest of the room/walls/carpet  Don't spray anything on anything you don't want to be sprayed.  If you don't feel like buying an expensive booth, build one out of poster board for a couple dollars.  Just a square with a 'back-splash' should keep your area clean.  When you get more comfortable with the brush you may not want to even use this set up.  Just a mat of some sort to keep your table clean will be fine. If you are using enamels or some other really smelly paints i hope you already have a good set up that will keep your lungs safe.  So just stick with acrylics and you'll be fine.  Oh and make sure you are careful with your airbrush cleaning fluid, those are usually pretty toxic.  Any other caveats I should be aware of before loading the airbrush with paint.  Make sure you have done your homework.  If you are hesitant about pouring paint in the brush, you haven't done enough research on the process.  YouTube will be your biggest friend in this regard.  I will link some good channels to get you started.  learn about airbrushing  How to make models  Reviews of stuff you will want to buy"

modelmakers,35fzdy,MadMorf,2,Sun May 10 23:29:00 2015 UTC,"Have a good light setup. Have multiple light sources from varying angles. Like as we might, this hobby is usually done burning the midnight oil. Light plays tricks on our eyes especially with airbrushing. You think you've fully covered a kit only to discover in the morning that half the hull isn't even painted. Flood your area with lots of light.  Have a good seated posture. You're going to be airbrushing for a good few hours, have good posture by having a good chair to use. Don't slouch. If your work area is too low, consider adding lifts. Ideally you want to hold your kit at chest height when spraying so adjust your work area to accommodate it best so you don't have to move a lot to get close to your model. Stage your work area in a way where everything is easily within reach. Tape up corners of your walls where things can easily roll into the nooks and crannies."
modelmakers,35fzdy,holocause,2,Sun May 10 04:12:36 2015 UTC,"I always use a big piece of cardboard, cut from a large box. Make sure it's good quality cardboard so the paint won't soak through. Underneath that I also use a large and cheap cutting mat. And I cover the surrounding workspace with plastic, usually with the plastic bags the sprues came in. I weigh the bags down with whatever is available, like the guinea pig kits I use for testing new techniques and paints."

modelmakers,35fzdy,jayadan,2,Sun May 10 11:22:30 2015 UTC,"Newspaper is sufficient (it's what I use), though a lot of people like spray booths - they drastically reduce the likelihood of getting paint somewhere you don't want. Some acrylics do, and some don't. I work with Model Master acrylics and almost never thin them. Play it by ear - if it's got a  milky consistency in the airbrush jar then you're good to go. Others may tell you otherwise, but every time I'm finished with a color I immediately take my airbrush apart and clean any parts that came in contact with paint using thinner (although acrylics can be washed with alcohol or soap and water in many cases). Some people will also tell you you can just spray thinner through it. I've never tried this but I'm adamant about making absolutely certain it's clean. Protecting the rest of the room - well, as I mentioned, a lot of guys on here like spray booths for just this purpose. I tend to do alright with my folding table and newspaper though - an airbrush won't have quite the overspray that a rattle can will. Other suggestions? Here's one. Before you do a single damn thing, get a respirator unless you like having sore throats and early death. I waited a year before getting one. Don't do that. Here's a link to a good, inexpensive one."

modelmakers,35fzdy,PriceZombie,1 point,Sun May 10 03:26:26 2015 UTC,Yeah i do the same with cleaning when swapping colours. It's just easier than getting the wrong paint on a model! Most airbrushes break down really easily anyway.   Personally I only use acrylics so I just clean them in a sink with warm water and a cotton bud.
modelmakers,35fzdy,BorisBC,2,Sun May 10 08:38:38 2015 UTC,"I may not be the best on advising on how to keep your painting surface clean, but I'll try to help. I would advise against using newspaper, I've never tried that but I'm not too sure about it. I have the feeling some paint would seep through it as it feel pretty thin. I'm using an old plastic tablecloth myself and it does the job fine.  Thinning: Normal acrylics have to be thinned, but there are airbrush paints that should be ready to use. Don't take them for their word though, always check the consistency with a little bit of paint. Everyone always says the consistency should be like milk, but you'll get a knack for feeling when it's just right after a time.  Cleaning: Get an airbrush cleaning pot. Seriously. Every time you switch paint you want to clean your airbrush with cleaning fluid and spray it out somewhere, and the cleaning pot is perfect to do just that. After you finished painting you also want to clean your airbrush again.   Protecting the rest of the room: If you are not doing anything strange then protection of the surface you are working on should be enough I think. Maybe something to catch any overspray, but that should be enough I think.Still, it doesn't hurt to make sure there are no valuables nearby."
modelmakers,35fzdy,Olaf_Gryf,2,Sun May 10 00:42:14 2015 UTC,Don't bend your needle. Don't overtighten your nozzle. I broke one of my nozzles and it cost 1/4th the airbrush to replace. Do spray far from the model to slow paint build up. Practise on cheap kits. 1/72 Aircraft or Tamiya's M41 Buldog are good candidates.

modelmakers,35emro,fixius60,2,Sat May 9 20:46:49 2015 UTC,"(I hope I am correct to assume this is brush painted) First build or not, I think you have done a great job.  The assembly looks pretty clean. I'd say the painting is good but it is also your biggest area to work on.  If you are sticking with brushes, which is fine, experiment with some plastic card or a cheapo kit.  See what works best in terms of paint to thinner ratios for you.  You don't want your practice to be done on your good models.  Also look into some weathering like panel washes.  If you want to get better results faster, look into an air setup.  I know it seems expensive to many people, but it is often no more than what you might spend on models and supplies over the course of a year.  We tend to not notice how quickly the little things add up.  There are some quality airbrushes that go on sale for around 70 dollars every so often.  A cheap compressor will do the job, for a while, if money is an issue.  let me know if there's anything else i can help with."

I just took standard Revell dark brown paint, thinned the hell out of it and lightly brushed it around the edges and creases at first. I did another pass over the entire model later to slightly add to the effect.  In fact, except for the black around the muzzle and on the MG the only colors used are Revell 16 and Revell 84"
modelmakers,35e53t,alaskafish,3,Sat May 9 16:27:18 2015 UTC,"At first I was confused what you were doing. ""Painting the hull on the sprews?!"" From that point, I kind of thought that this build was going to be a new modelers model. I continue through the album and I see you're weathering... but with normal paint and a brush. I was like ""Oh no... this isn't going to come out well."" I continue and I see something amazing.  I swear, at first I was going to think this was your first model, and you weren't skilled. Then when you started weathering, I was going to think the model was just going to go downhill. Then Boom! The model looked amazing. I really thought it was going to be a low quality model, but I'm not joking. It really does look absolutely amazing!   The only criticism is you're base coat paint is too thick. You can slightly see the brush lines.  But once you weather it, you can't. So... really, there's non."

The flip side is that it's almost a little too clean, for my next ship I hope to improve that with a lot more weathering, heavier washes and more stuff via a PE set. I think the water is a solid improvement from my first ship, the wake and foam looks decent, but I'm not so sure I have it arranged in a totally realistic way, something I'll research more for the next one as well.

I call it the rollercoaster paintjob (as in my emotion goes up and down following each phase of the painting) because the tone of color in the first step will always be off to some degree. In this case the brown was too yellowish and too saturated.   So what I did was go light on the dark wash, and go thick on the matt finish. Matt finish tend to lower saturation and increase brightness, sort of like a washout (old colored clothes become desaturated etc). So I did apply 3 layers of it until the color match that of the desert camo in the reference picture.  The rivets were actually the hole-type, as in they do not project outwards but rather inwards like small holes. I don't know if the real P40 is like this but a quick dark wash make them stand out just fine."

modelmakers,35dava,Restfulleo23,2,Sat May 9 05:16:03 2015 UTC,The corsair was hand painted might I add. The wildcat was airbrushed. I'm a beginner at this so any criticism is welcome. Would love to learn some new techniques maybe or a better way of applying decals so they look more authentic.
modelmakers,35dava,ionizzatore,2,Sat May 9 05:24:18 2015 UTC,"Would love to learn some new techniques maybe   Since you own an airbrush, in no particular order:   Preshading: basically you draw lines with your airbrush along the panel lines and then you cover the model with paint, the paint will have a darker shade along the border. You can also use this technique to add some variation to the inside of the panel. Just an example: http://imgur.com/a/8mplK Panel picking. This is usually ignored but it can lead to a really nice effect: Mask some panel with masking tape, leaving the panel ""visible"" and masking what is around it. Then paint a sightly darker or sightly lighter tone inside of the panel, remove the masking. This will help to break the monotony of the paint and it will give a nice used look to the ariplane (this is usually true for us navy planes, where panels are usually repaired/repainted/replaced on the aircraft carrier and the repairs are done with what is available aboard) Mask the clear parts of the canopy and paint the frame, the plane will look a loot better   Non-airbrush related:   Panel line washes: really thinned enamel/oil paint (if you are using acrylics as a base) along the panel lines. This will enhance the depth of the panel lines, no more flat paintjobs! Pin washes: put little drops of oil paint (if you are using acrylics in underneath layers) on the wings and fuselage, then, using a flat brush damped in mineral spirit, blend the color, pulling in the direction of the airflow. This is usually applied on tanks, but has its uses on any kind of large surface.   Keep in mind that washes require:   A glossy surface, if you apply a wash over matt surfaces the wash will ""grip"" on the paint and you will obtain a different effect. A paint based on a different medium from the paint underneath. If you paint your model with enamels, use an acrylic, if you paint your model with acrylics, use enamels/oil paints. This is because you usually use a lot of thinner while applying washes, and if you use the same thinner that is used by the underneath paint...    or a better way of applying decals so they look more authentic.   Gloss coat. It will avoid the silvering of the carrier (the transparent part of the decal) and the decal will have a better adhesion. Once the decal is dried in place spray another clear coat to seal everything in place and even the surface, then you can apply washes or use a matt coat to complete the work."

Paint chipping and rust is often overdone, mud is often slathered on with little thought for how it would actually accumulate.  I also dont think weathering should be used to hide poor workmanship.  Its true you can get away with it here and there but the best base for good weathering is a nicely done clean model.  Keep in mind that even an 'as issued' model can benefit from some basic weathering.  Some washes, some dust.  Makes it look more like the real thing and less like a model.  Gather as many photos of your subject as possible in the setting you wish to depict and study them carefully."

I put dots on it using oil paint and with a soft moist brush, I brushed the dots down to create rain streaks. Finally, I mixed up soft pastels and water to create a dark wash. I brushed this on and once dried, wiped off the excess with a q-tip. These will get wiped off if you don't seal it so I used Mr. Super Clear Matte to clear coat the model.

First and foremost, I discussed it some with my father whom I am giving this model to once finished, and he said that he wanted it looking like it was brand new.  The second reason is that I have never actually weathered anything and while I have seen many images of highly skilled weathering jobs, it would be very easy to over do and ruin what is, so far, coming along as a pretty solid build.  Great weathering jobs are artisan handcrafted works of art. They are subtle and take into account the way that the detail would look scaled down.

This leaves horrible cut lines and where the paint comes together looks to sharp when it need to be more gradient. Also paint seeps under my tape. I'm using just basic paint tape. Its a few years old is that why? Also what is the beifits of recall contact glue over tamiya ultra thin? Can I glue painted parts with contact and not worry about the glue ruining the paint?
modelmakers,35ap2n,frugm1,3,Sat May 9 02:41:57 2015 UTC,"Really it depends on what type of camouflage you are doing.  Here are some tips that i'd suggest.  For sharp lines, use Tamiya tape, it's a lot thinner than regular masking tape and will produce a crisper line. lay pieces onto a scrap piece of plastic such as a clean butter container lid and cut them out to shape on that. If you need to you can use paper to create templates from your model to transfer onto the tape.  Once you have laid your tape down burnish the edges with a qtip or tooth pick to make sure it is well seated against the plastic.  If you're brush painting use thin coats and stroke the brush away from the tapes edge rather than towards it, this will help to stop the paint from creeping under the tape. The same basic principles apply to airbrushing.  If you want a softer line you can use blutack to create lines on your model then brush or spray your model. Or if you want a real smooth gradient just freehand it, which is what I tend to do.  Unless you do a wet blending the only true way to get softer edges is airbrushing.  So just to summarize;  use Tamiya masking tape for fine edges, regular cheaper tape is fine for general coverage.  Paint away from the edge of the tape not towards it."

modelmakers,35abc4,Jabnl,4,Fri May 8 13:01:16 2015 UTC,"Try thinning out the paint. It will require more coats but less brush marks. Also look into investing on a quality set of artist's brushes. Something with natural hair. Those also minimize the brush marks. Masking for brush work is a bitch because almost always the brush will lift the edge of the tape and mess up your line. Get the tamiya masking tape and burnish in the edges after applying it so paint doesn't go under. For that matter, learn the painstaking art of masking canopy frames, it's worth the time and frustration. Your models will look 200% better with canopy frames on them. YouTube is your friend. A lot of tutorials there. There was a dude who posted a few of his brushed painted planes in Aircraft Resource Center and it was amazing that they looked airbrushed. It can be done that well."

But using LEDs might mean connecting them to fiber optics as they might not have the same lighting intensity in smaller models.  I have used similar techniques.  You may consider drilling the portholes/windows or add fiber optics (still includes drilling). Either way it's tough as the amount of man hours spent are substantial. Also the the scale of the model/prop plays a big part in the illusion. The smaller models/props are harder to make look to scale. Generally most folks I've talked to say make the prop/model as big as money and time will permit. Larger models are more time consuming but are easier to handle and work with concerning details.   Paint is also a hurdle as a larger prop/model is painted differently than a small scale model. Especially concerning ""weathering"" techniques."

After applying chalk pastels and finishing it, I think it came out okay. I don't know if the fire burn makes sense where it is coming from, under the bottom panel seam..

I really like the metal on the tracks. How did you make the tracks rusty and make the exposed bits metallic? I've been trying to get that effect for quite some time. And did you do any post/pre shading or color modulation on this?   I must ask... did you do the salt technique like that on purpose? By ""that"" I mean inverted. From what I've been doing is painting the model rust color, then putting the salt in the areas I want the rust to show. Then paint over with the base color. Regardless, it looks cool. To me at least, it may not look like chipped paint, but it most definitely looks like burned paint.   Side note, the French did build some wacky tanks."
modelmakers,356oor,tankbuster183,4,Thu May 7 15:38:38 2015 UTC,"1/35th scale M8 Greyhound. The kit is from Tamiya, interior set and resin engine are Verlinden.  This is one of those builds where I bought all the sets at one time, then lost interest for 10 years.  I built it out of guilt for having spent all the money on it. (I don't know if anyone else does this, but I did enjoy the build!).  There was some minor cutting of the rear floor panels to fit the resin engine in. The interior set was really just the 37mm shell rack and all the equipment add-ons. I chose to leave the fenders off because I like the look if it. The .50 cal is also Verlinden.  The rest of the kit fit together with usual Tamiya ease.  For some odd reason, I just realized I never added radio antennas.  M8 was painted with Tamiya acrylics, OD lightened with desert yellow.  All chipping done with Vallejo/Humbrol.  Oil paint washes, and MIG pigments on the wheels.  I probably could/should have weathered the interior/engine compartment a bit more, but my mindset was that this particular vehicle was in France at the end of summer 1944 after the liberation of Paris, and probably hadn't been in combat yet.

modelmakers,35444t,35thArmorGuy,3,Wed May 6 23:27:31 2015 UTC,"Thanks. In all honesty I will be a complete newbie at it. Havn't built a model in a while (since I was a kid) and thought it would be fun to give it a try again. I have a movie room in my house that I have a Sci-Fi theme going on, and I thought it would be awesome to build some models and display them in there. In the last 2 weeks I have gone out and bought/built 3 different Star Wars model kits. I have seen some lighting videos on youtube, but nothing that really starts at square 1. All I want to do for my first model is just add 3 white LED lights on a Star Wars Lambda class shuttle like the one pictured here: http://img2.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20100813150543/starwars/images/a/af/Shuttle-CHRON.jpg   After that I will attempt to light the back: http://www.xwaupgrade.com/screenshots/shuttle/shuttle6.jpg  Just dont know where to start."
modelmakers,35444t,35thArmorGuy,6,Wed May 6 23:43:03 2015 UTC,"Well, the 3 white lights should be pretty easy. You'll need:   Some wire. Can be pretty thin, a little spool would be like 5 bucks 3 White LEDs. Don't know how big the model is, so I don't know which size you would need. I'd avoid super bright LEDS though, since they can be hurt the eyes bright. Typical sizes are 3mm and 5mm diameter. 3 Resistors. Once you figure out what LEDs you want, I could figure the resistor value you'd need. On Off switch Some Batteries. For most LEDs you'd supply 5V. So a cheap plastic battery holder for 3-4 AA/AAA batteries. Edit: found a nice little case that comes with a switch battery case Some perfboard. It's this board with evenly spaced holes for placing components so you can solder pieces together.    Sourcing parts: Sparkfun Nice site for hobbyists and tinkerers. Doesn't completely overwhelm you with parts, but should have everything you need. If you need really specialized sizes or parts there are places like Digikey.com and Mouser. They have everything, but it'd be easy to get lost in there.   First thing though. I'd figure out where you'd put the battery pack, switch and your little circuit board. Ideally it should be hidden inside the model, but remain accessible for battery changes and the like."
modelmakers,35444t,space_farm,3,Thu May 7 00:18:13 2015 UTC,"Hey man, I'm getting into LEDs as well. One seriously useful tool I've come across is the LED Parallel Array Wizard. Source voltage being the power source like a battery, forward voltage and current of the LEDs you will be using and the number of LEDs you will be using. It'll display the result as a wiring diagram or schematic and give you the resistor values you should use. After that you're pretty much set. Just choose the best answer and wire your LEDs accordingly."

The topcoat (light green) is flaking off, revealing a base coat of darker green, which was probably the original color of the vehicle. Here:  http://i.imgur.com/1wlDIdU.jpg  ...on the side of the gun mantlet, you can see 3 colors of paint-- the light green over a sort of grey over a darker green. Under that, like underneath the viewport, you can see where all the paint is gone and there's a rusty patch.   I'm guessing that the original color was dark green and the grey and light green were painted over it when it was moved to the museum setting. And it hasn't been sanded down (or sandblasted) since then, so it's slowly rusting out.

modelmakers,352qcg,Callmebobbyorbooby,3,Wed May 6 16:44:18 2015 UTC,"Starting at 50/50 and going from there is probably a good move. Bear in mind you also have air pressure as a variable as well. There aren't rules with paint thinning/air pressure as already mentioned, you just need to mess around until something works, you'll develop a feel for it in time.   I find myself thinning Tamiya paints more than I thought I needed to because they seem to splatter easily - they're a little hard to get a good, fine line with. That's just with certain colors. For instance, I find it nearly impossible to spray Tamiya Flat White smoothly, no matter what. To get really fine lines with other Tamiya colors, I have to have the paint mixed up as thin as a transparent glaze.  If I'm just doing a single color with no thoughts of precision, I just thin enough so the paint flows, so maybe 70:30 or 60:40 paint to thinner. Detail work of course requires much more thinner. I usually spray around 15-30 psi."
modelmakers,352qcg,MMGeoff,2,Wed May 6 17:15:18 2015 UTC,"Ok awesome, thanks for the help! I didn't realize how much goes in to airbrushing until I got one. I love it, but there sure is a lot to learn."
modelmakers,352qcg,frugm1,3,Wed May 6 17:33:55 2015 UTC,"There really is no hard and fast rule when it comes to thinning paints. The consistency of milk is what most people say, this can vary from paint brand to paint brand, even the same color/brand from batch to batch. The only sure fire way is to put some paint in your airbrush and slowly add thinners until when you test spray it comes out smooth. I personally mix it right in the cup."
modelmakers,352qcg,Plundersquirrel,1 point,Wed May 6 17:02:41 2015 UTC,Yeah that's what I've been trying to go by is the milk thing. I've only been painting with enamels and it seems to work with that. I'm assuming acrylics are thicker so you have to thin them more? It seems like with enamel the thinning is 85/15 or 90/10.
modelmakers,352qcg,Plundersquirrel,2,Wed May 6 17:13:21 2015 UTC,I always thin my paints (although I use Humbrol) about 50/50 or 55/45 paint to thinner.
modelmakers,352qcg,tankbuster183,1 point,Wed May 6 16:50:50 2015 UTC,I guess it'll be just trial and error. I'm just used to using very little thinner with enamels but I've heard acrylics require more. Looking forward to the easier to clean part too.

Just because something doesn't smell bad doesn't mean it isn't (example: carbon monoxide).  Tamiya is an acrylic lacquer, and when you shoot it, it's an airborne solid...so even though it doesn't smell terrible, it is awful on your lungs, maybe even worse than enamel."

Also, while I have you here, any advice on spraying the lacquer gloss coat? It looks like I had the PSI too high and it gave it an inconsistent kind of grainy look. Do I need to drop the PSI when doing that or hold the brush closer or further away while spraying?  Thanks for all the tips!"

modelmakers,350bf0,Combicon,9,Wed May 6 01:15:58 2015 UTC,"At the absolute beginner phase, all that matters is whether or not you enjoyed putting a model together, and the only truly useful advice is to build another!  The basic construction is the most important thing. Try to make sure everything is aligned properly, don't be in a rush while you're building. Take the time to get things like your wheel struts at the proper angles and keep them secured in place with something to hold them where they're supposed to be while the glue is drying. Biplanes are tough to build since you've got two sets of wings and all the accompanying struts to mess with. Set your model down on a flat surface and use a ruler to check the distance between each wingtip and the ground - make sure the distance is the same on the left and right side. Make sure everything that is supposed to be 90 degrees is 90 degrees. Little alignment problems will throw off the look of your model and make it much less ""believable"" when it's finished. You'll get better at this with experience. I've been building for 15 years and I can detect a slight alignment error from across a room. If a model airplane doesn't ""sit"" right on it's landing gear, it shows.  As for the paint, make sure you're stirring it well before you use it. Use something like a toothpick as a stir stick and stir for a couple of minutes until the paint is smooth with no lumps. That way all the components of the paint will be properly blended together and it will dry the way it's been designed to.  But seriously, if you enjoyed building this model, then build another. Everything will come to you with experience, and I am nothing but glad that you're considering buying another!  ....Please don't use scissors to cut parts away from the sprues, get a sprue cutter like this http://www.amazon.ca/Testors-50628C-Sprue-Cutters/dp/B0006NDZG2  You can use a hobby knife to remove parts as well but I really consider actual sprue cutters to be one of the absolute bare minimum tools required to build a model. You'll have the least chance of damaging a part when you're using them correctly."
modelmakers,350bf0,MMGeoff,3,Wed May 6 02:58:12 2015 UTC,"Older Airfix models can be very poor (they are over 40 years old in some cases), but all the starter kits are new tools and very good. The Gladiator is not the easiest start with fragile, sticky-outy pieces.  Over time you get a knack for handling the model in such a way to avoid breakage, and leave such pieces off until most handling is done.  Airfix have retooled most of the iconic single engined fighter plane kits, and you'll find them easier. Leave off the undercarriage until after painting and decaling, and when you do put them on, set the model up with something under the wings to hold it (paint bottles work, stacks of playing cards work better), glue the legs in place and get them positioned, then leave the model overnight.  Congrats on your first model, hold on to it as your collection grows. Thanks for posting it."

Unfortunatly the shop I got the model from only had three models - that one (which was the last, and I quite like the look of biplanes), an attack helecopter, and a jet. Only one of the other two was a starter kit with paints as well, so... I might get that."

modelmakers,3510ih,rangamatchstick,5,Wed May 6 05:13:03 2015 UTC,It could be because the propellant can is getting cold and losing it's pressure.  Put the can in a bowl with 2 inches of hot water and this might help.

modelmakers,34xjmn,black42x,8,Tue May 5 11:47:28 2015 UTC,"This is my first attempt at 'proper' modelling - Some of you might have come across my pervious, somewhat unorthodox approach to model making. This time around though I wanted to skip the exploded-view so I could focus on learning how to use an airbrush, making sure things fit properly (and hide the joins) and spend more time focusing on the details.  The kit is an Airfix 1:48 English Electric Lightning F.2A/F.6 and I had a go with Alclad paints for the majority of the paintwork (polished, dark and aluminium), there's quite a few mistakes that I think I could have hid better with another layer of the polished aluminium but I kinda liked the texture and dirty appearance it gave. I had a bit of a go at weathering too but I'm sure there's lots of room for improvement there. Big thanks to this community too, it was a fantastic resource for techniques and discussions I found while researching techniques and guides.   Main problem at the moment is I feel like the paints and tools will go to waste if I don't use them, which leads to buying a model... which leads to buying more paints and tools..."
modelmakers,34xjmn,MMGeoff,2,Tue May 5 11:47:40 2015 UTC,What kind of airbrush did you use to paint the Alclad?
modelmakers,34xjmn,MMGeoff,2,Wed May 6 02:43:47 2015 UTC,"I've been using a 35-ish year old Holbein Y-1 (Dual action, gravity fed, I think it's a 0.2mm needle?) running at about 12psi. Needle's a bit bent and the cap is dented but it seems to work pretty well."
modelmakers,34xjmn,pitak89,2,Wed May 6 04:40:55 2015 UTC,"I've found you can get better results with a single action airbrush when you're spraying metallics. Technically, a single action brush is better for broad coverage than a dual action thanks to its consistent, wider spray pattern. With a dual action, you kind of get these irregular blotchy areas of different sheen when you're spraying a metallic color, this is probably because the needle is constantly moving around as you're spraying."

modelmakers,34xjmn,MadMorf,3,Wed May 6 02:00:30 2015 UTC,"Come on now, you don't get to build a ton of models and then build something that looks this nice and say it's your first serious attempt!  I like how smoothly you got the coat of blue on the vertical fin and spine of the aircraft; I think it's easy to understate the importance of getting paint on smooth. It contributes hugely to the realism and professionalism of the overall finished look of the model.  The brake line is a great, simple touch that adds a lot. Great work on the decals, I'm not seeing any silvering at all.  I do, however, see the seams left over from the fuselage halves that still need work. It's really difficult getting perfect seams on a natural metal finish, and I honestly don't know if I can do any better, but next time pay closer attention to the seams.  Something about Lightnings makes them really interesting. They're absolutely hideous but they're just cool and when they're done nicely, they make a great looking model. Yours is making me want to start my Airfix Lightning in 1/72."
modelmakers,34xjmn,Janusz211,2,Wed May 6 02:42:45 2015 UTC,"Haha well, first time building a model for the sake of modelling rather than for a photo shall we say. I had a go using Tamiya's White Putty for some of the larger seams but I've definitely got to practice more with it and learn where and when it should be used. I used Alclad's gloss black base straight onto the plastic, do you think using a coat of primer first have helped hide the seams? or just a case of more sanding/filling?   Thanks for the feedback!"
modelmakers,34xjmn,Extra330SC,2,Wed May 6 04:27:42 2015 UTC,"I've seen your exploded view photos, that's a really interesting approach to modelling, especially combining it with your photography!  Putty works to fill seams, but it has a different consistency than the surrounding plastic. You'll notice it's a little bit porous. This matters when you're spraying something like Alclad, which has an incredibly fine pigment. Alclad (and any natural metal finish) will highlight every surface flaw on your model so things really have to be flawless, hence the difficulty.  I'd recommend, for next time, being extremely careful during construction, and using medium-thick superglue to fill seams. Superglue sands down to an almost glasslike consistency and it blends right in to the surrounding plastic. Really, it's an ideal filler in nearly all cases. If you come across a small, hairline seam, thin superglue will be able to fill that.  Putty is generally best to ""build up"" areas. Say you have a ""step"" rather than a gap, where two halves of a piece didn't line up correctly and one side is higher than the other. Ideally, you eliminate steps through careful assembly, but sometimes they happen. The low area can be puttied up so it meets the high area, that's what putty is best for. I'm guilty myself, but putty really isn't the ""all purpose filler"" as we make it out to be. Most gaps can be quickly and effectively filled with superglue.  I bet the model looked perfect when you were done sanding, and since you applied a black base to the model you didn't notice the seams - dark colors hide errors a little better. Alclad also makes a gray primer that is by far the best primer I've ever used. Primer won't hide seams - it will do the opposite, actually. It will tell you what areas need more work before the actual color coats go on."

modelmakers,34znp9,maninthefan,4,Tue May 5 21:56:55 2015 UTC,"When I apply future with my airbrush I tend to get that effect as well, I wouldn't worry about it to much. My pain jobs always turn out smooth. My guess would be is because future is self leveling by nature when you spray fine coats it's there's not really enough on the surface to have it self level. Future just doesn't give a glossy enough coat for decals, but that's just my opinion. I prefer to use rattle can gloss Krylon. I do use coats of future in between various weathering techniques just to seal them."
modelmakers,34znp9,frugm1,4,Wed May 6 12:37:43 2015 UTC,"You want the Future to go on wet, as /u/Timmyc62 is saying.  Spraying Future is a bit of an art, but to get it on smoothly it has to look wet when it hits the surface of the model. It has to go on heavily, but not runny. Too light and it gets dusty and rough. This advice actually applies to paint application in general - the key to a smooth finish is in the application, ""painting wet"" is how it's done and it takes a bit of experience to know how to do that consistently.  Right now you're probably risking silvering, which looks especially bad over a black surface. You can knock down some of that roughness with very fine sandpaper. It's the smoothness, not the glossy sheen, that provides the ideal surface for decal application so your concerns are absolutely correct."
modelmakers,34znp9,MMGeoff,2,Wed May 6 16:29:17 2015 UTC,"I'm going to stray from the rest of the comments so far and say that the problem isn't in your application of Future, it's the underlying surface. I suspect that your flat black base went down ""dusty"" (i.e. textured) and no reasonable amount of Future is going to level it out. You could try using a heavier gloss coat instead of Future, sand it out with a very fine grit, or sand it all down and re-spray your color coat (the SR-71's corrugated surfaces make this kind of impractical). Maybe others have other suggestions.  I think I would just go ahead with decals, myself. I feel like the level of gloss you have on the surface should be good enough to prevent silvering, and if you use MicroSet/MicroSol then the decals should conform to the surface texture pretty well."
modelmakers,34znp9,Dr_Von_Spaceman,3,Wed May 6 17:19:47 2015 UTC,"I hadn't considered sanding the paint before applying a clear coat, but now I'll have to try it on my next model, it's an interesting idea, and I'm curious to see what the result will be, both on metallic and regular matte colours, especially since brush painting is not the greatest for a smooth finish. Besides, I think I should be fine with 1500+ grit, I just hope that it won't strip too much paint, or maybe I'm being extra cautious in thinking about this method...  That being said, is it possible to also do a bit of sanding on the clear coat, or would that be overkill? Similarly, if I were to do some sanding on the second clear coat over the decals, would that affect the decals beneath, i.e. scuff them?"
modelmakers,34znp9,Medjoe,3,Thu May 7 17:48:32 2015 UTC,"To take it to an extreme, check out what the hard-core car model guys are doing. Man, they really put a lot of care into their gloss finishes.  You may be able to do some sanding on the clear coat, but you'll probably need to apply another layer over it. With Future, I suspect this may lead to some variation in the surface texture since some of the surface under your final Future coat(s) will be paint and some will be Future. A heavier gloss coat would probably be more robust for it. I would not sand over decals at all. And really, you shouldn't need to. If you spray your final Future layer wet as others have said, it should leave a good smooth surface.  If you end up wanting to do some polishing at some point, I found a set of very fine sand paper at Hobby Lobby of all places. Goes all the way down to 12,000. It's been great for pepping natural metal surfaces."
modelmakers,34znp9,Dr_Von_Spaceman,3,Fri May 8 00:59:02 2015 UTC,"12000 grit? Golly, and I thought seeing 2500-3000 at a nearby hardware store was alot! Ironically the guys in the store told me to check the automobile section for high grit sandpaper, and that's where I found mine. I'm using a different product, a matte sealer for acrylics, but it shouldn't be all that different in results. Regarding the time of the application, I think that directly after the paint coats is the most critical one, because that is the main cause of silvering.   A question that popped up later: what about sanding and camo patterns? Does it tend to mess up the pattern because some paint fragments are being moved around?"
modelmakers,34znp9,Medjoe,3,Fri May 8 01:26:15 2015 UTC,"Couldn't say. I've only sanded and polished single-color paint jobs for playing with natural metal finishes or, recently, an overall gloss white job. The real solution is to get better at spraying your base coats such that you don't have to sand/polish. I'm still learning that one, myself, as I try to get away from textured matte surfaces to those nice smooth paint jobs that the pros manage."
modelmakers,34znp9,Dr_Von_Spaceman,1 point,Fri May 8 02:04:04 2015 UTC,How are you applying the Future? It shouldn't be so rough.
modelmakers,34znp9,Timmyc62,2,Wed May 6 04:48:35 2015 UTC,"I'm using a double action airbrush with a diaphragm compressor. Shooting the future at 15 psi. Also light mist coats, about 10 there."
modelmakers,34znp9,Timmyc62,3,Wed May 6 04:54:13 2015 UTC,"Try doing heavier coats - sounds counterproductive, but Future's self-levelling property requires a decently thick application in order for there to be enough liquid to level out evenly."

During school holidays my grandparents would take us there and I could buy something expensive, more than a 7 years old could afford from pocket money. When I made WWII-models at their kitchentable my grandpa told stories about the war, about when he saw those models IRL. I think that was the startpoint for my warbirds-'obsession'.    As a teen I stopped building models, I picked it up again a few years ago and was amazed how the world of modelmaking had evolved, with high qualitiy kits, PE- and resin aftermarket goodies, and affordable airbrushes. And internet for doing research, of course, and talking to fellow modelmaker-nerds like you guys ;)"
modelmakers,34xqcq,borrokalari,3,Wed May 6 09:53:45 2015 UTC,"My story is going to start similar to yours /u/willkinton247. My dad got my into models.  When I was a kid he had this huge 1/32 F14 model he built and I always wanted to play with it and he never let me.  Not long after my parents separated, when I was going to my father's he didn't care about me. He never had any activities planned nor did her ever wanted to do anything with me.  One day he was tired of me complaining about never having anything to do so he put me in front of an old Piper plane model kit he had laying around and his old tools just so I could shut up.  He didn't show me anything nor did he ever gave me any tips.  Not a happy story... but in any case the model making stuck and I've been doing them ever since. :)"
modelmakers,34xqcq,EM2Hero,3,Wed May 6 10:56:26 2015 UTC,"When I was a wee lad (6-7 years old), I'd visit my family back in eastern Europe. Most of the time I would visit my cousin Tom out in farm country. I didn't know at that time that my cousin Tom was big on modeling, though that summer before I went to visit the family, mum took me to a hobby store or a Toy Store, and had me choose out a model for him. When I gave him the model, he took me to his little work shop in his room and he had dozens of aircraft models displayed (a very captivating moment for a 7 year old plane enthusiast to say the least). He had me help him build a CF-18 Hornet model that summer, and before I left to go back home to Canada, he bought me a model of an F-14 Tomcat as a gift. And ever since then I've been on and off the modeling bandwagon. Good times since then, and many more to come. Happy Building :D"

modelmakers,34xqcq,dino123,2,Thu May 7 11:24:20 2015 UTC,"Same for me. My Dad and I built model kits ""together"". Mind you he never painted them but it still was enough to get me hooked. We did a jet airplane, a helicopter, and a tank. This combined with the many Cereal Premiums I got  of trains, cars, etc. that came in plastic sprues similar to model kits except that they didn't require glue. We're talking the 1970s. I'm 49 now."

modelmakers,34z98f,Medjoe,2,Tue May 5 22:05:59 2015 UTC,"Fonderie is the only game in town, but it's a hard kit. The newish Revell 1/72 kit is the best one, but it builds a Merlin-engined version.  I think the Hercules-engined version is an imminent release. The old Matchbox kit can be made into an okay model.  The potential issue is the different Halifax versions were quite distinct with different engines, noses and vertical fins."

modelmakers,34w58w,tombrend,2,Tue May 5 03:32:29 2015 UTC,"Thank you!! The kit was a Trumpeter Canadian AVGP Grizzly [Late]. I picked it because it looked like it would be relatively easy to paint, and it came with those cool rubber tires and some photoetched parts.  I used Testor's Flat green, laid down two thin coats of Minwax gloss polyacrylic varnish, and used a really thin (25/75) mix of black acrylic Model Masters for the wash. I like how the varnish and wash really gave the green a deep dark look (it was a lot lighter than I liked at first), and how it really made it look greasy and dirty.  The rest of the pics are posted in a different comment above."

There were quite a lot o steps for this one, I black based it and then painted it so I got shading from applying more paint to certain areas. After decals I did I black/brown enamel panel wash. Once that was all done I used salt and thin coats of white and brown to add a faded appearence. After that I just used a regular silver pencil and applied it where I thought he real thing would have chipped . lastly the brown greasy stains are brown oil streaked backwards just with a regular brush same with the exhaust. And then some extra pigments and charcoal for the guns and exhaust"

modelmakers,34x38z,MMGeoff,3,Wed May 6 01:03:45 2015 UTC,I'm enjoying the kit so far. It's taken me a bit to settle in. I'm fairly certain that after the cockpit is finished the rest of the model will feel like it has fallen into place.
modelmakers,34x38z,MMGeoff,2,Wed May 6 06:46:35 2015 UTC,"That's a fantastic start so far, those bombs look great with the photo etch detail.  You do need to roll up the front part of the seat, and you've got some burrs left over on that particular part. You can remove those with some flat-nosed tweezers and a jeweler's file. Hold the part with the tweezers in such a way that only the burr is exposed - you want the tweezers protecting and supporting the fragile piece so it isn't bent and distorted by the movement of the file. Then, with a few passes, knock the burr down with the file. You should be able to roll the front lip of the seat up to meet the sides with a toothpick or a piece of sprue, something round in cross section."
modelmakers,34x38z,ionizzatore,2,Wed May 6 03:15:37 2015 UTC,Great advice all around. Photo etch is an art to itself.   The learning curve is steep but manageable. I find I'm getting significantly more comfortable as I go.

Sometimes they have a kit that includes several bottles of paint, brushes, and other tools you may need for around $20. A sprue cutter and hobby knife (like an x-acto) are probably my most used tools, followed by a pair of hobby tweezers.  Now, I've never done the rigging on one of these, but I hear that's where the fun begins!"

In theory, with each successive reissue, the molding quality gets worse and worse as the molds deteriorate slightly with each use. Revell have also bought the molds for several old kits so what looks like a shiny new kit of, say, the Heinkel He-219 is actually a kit made by Frog back in the Neolithic Era.  Revell of course do their own kits and they keep up to date with modern standards so they have plenty of top quality kits - the majority I would say are up to a modern standard but do some research beforehand to make sure you're not buying something that was first molded in 8000 BC."

modelmakers,34vbbo,CrtureBlckMacaroons,1 point,Tue May 5 04:39:36 2015 UTC,"Sounds like the kit has been knocked around in the box. Many truck kits are older, so the 'industry standard' is perhaps a bit lower which accounts for the positive reviews. But having said that, many of the issues you describe are part of modelmaking and not a condemnation of the kit.  Parts need to be 'cleaned up' a lot, as long as they then fit together okay, that's a good kit. Sounds like Revell could have packed the model better but that's a fairly new thing.  Certainly Japanese kits set high standards, they love their packaging and presentation as well as (usually) good engineering."

Pigments Powders are good because they're very fine and look appropriate to scale.   Another option is taking Plaster of Paris (or just regular plaster), and mixing it with a bit of brown paint. Get a thick coverage of brown paint on a brush and dab it all over a pile a plaster of paris. Then, just dab that mixture on the tank.  Last option (the budget option) is to go outside, get some dirty and apply with some gloss coat.   Add gloss coat to pigment/plaster/dirt for mud, and add matt coat for dried mud.

I mix the Fresh Mud from Mig with the plaster until I get the consistency of pancake mix.

It creates some sort of splatters on the model and the mud looks like it naturally landed there.  Here's an image I just did to explain the thing."

modelmakers,34tdh5,HughJorgens,1 point,Mon May 4 20:38:16 2015 UTC,"With the shipping at $20, if I could theoretically pick it up for the same price as a generic branded tank compressor or less, is it really worth the drop in quality to get the tank as well?"
modelmakers,34tdh5,HughJorgens,1 point,Mon May 4 23:02:14 2015 UTC,"It is still completely usable, but trying to do detailed camo work or something like that will suffer because the air pulses stronger and then weaker, which will influence how much paint is coming out of the airbrush at any given moment. So if you paint a straight line, it could look like this. -o-o-o-o- Trust us when we say you will be happier with one with a tank.  The airflow is steady and you can adjust the pressure."
modelmakers,34tdh5,thatg33kgirl,1 point,Mon May 4 23:14:15 2015 UTC,"Depending on shipping price (it doesn't show it for me) it might be a good deal. I have a similar one and it has lasted me for about 4 years now, and it does what I need it to do. (I don't use it for things like cakes, tshirts, just models and custom toys).    When it does decide to kick the bucket, I am planning on getting a pancake compressor (akin to this but not necessarily this one) since it will do the 30 or so PSI I need for airbrushing, but we can also use it for things around the house as well."
modelmakers,34rxhp,guyridingonabuffalo,8,Mon May 4 01:14:55 2015 UTC,"I think you'll go far if that's your first model, my friend.  Nice work."
modelmakers,34rxhp,84mg09,4,Mon May 4 15:04:01 2015 UTC,"Superb build, specially for a first model!  Just a couple of notes:   Next time try to protect the insignias from the white, like this. It was common practice to paint the winter camo over the ""real"" camo. (personal preference) The weathering is ok, subtle, in the right areas and with the right tones (brown-ish instead of black), but the model looks somehow ""pristine"", next time try to chip a little bit more heavily used areas such as borders of the hatches and ""paths"" (where people pass in order to climb/descent), for example engine area and front of the turret should be covered by winter camo, but not the handrails and areas around handrails and passages should be a little more chipped. Again, this is personal preference   You are talented, keep it up! (:"
modelmakers,34rxhp,ionizzatore,2,Mon May 4 15:52:23 2015 UTC,"Thanks! I used hairspray and was intending to take a lot of the white off, but either I did not use enough or I let it dry for too long. I found it too hard to get the white off without scratching through the green too. You are definitely right that it does not look ""used"" enough. Next time I will try masking fluid for more control."
modelmakers,34rxhp,edtheredted,2,Tue May 5 00:21:19 2015 UTC,That's beautiful! Have you done painting like this before? Because this is a great first model
modelmakers,34rxhp,alaskafish,3,Mon May 4 20:29:57 2015 UTC,"I originally painted it green but that paint didn't turn out well (still learning to use the airbrush). To save the model, I used hairspray and then painted it white to make a whitewash camouflage. But then the white stuck too well so I was not able to do much chipping. In areas where I was determined to make the chipping to work I scraped so much that I accidentally scraped through the green and down to the primer. I was able to hide most of the damage with more paint and placing the spare track on the front.  So don't give up if paint doesn't work as planned. There are a lot of opportunities to change direction and still make something that looks good.  Also, I learned a lot ahead of time from watching youtube videos and lurking on reddit."
modelmakers,34r5ch,solipsistnation,4,Sun May 3 21:06:17 2015 UTC,"This is the Hobby Boss 1/35 kit-- the decals that come with it (chalked-on numbers) are actually the markings the scrapyard used to keep track of it, so I didn't use those. Instead I dug up some spare US stars and used those. I'm not totally happy with how they wrap around the turret armor flaps, but there they are.   I wrote up most of the build stuff in my post yesterday... I finished the tracks up with chalk pastels, let that dry overnight, brushed off the excess, and went over the raised bits with a soft lead pencil. I also think I went overboard with scratches and stuff, but I was trying out some different techniques and I think I have a better handle on them now.   Anyway, here it is!"

modelmakers,34qs9l,Cohacq,6,Sun May 3 19:15:21 2015 UTC,"I'll have to repeat Tamiya for ease of building. Only problem is some of their newer kits are pricey. The older ones are cheaper, but can be soft on detail, but since it's your first build that shouldn't matter.  Trumpeter is also good. Their KV series of tanks are pretty easy to build and are also pretty cheap. My first kit was actually Trumpeter's KV-2  I'd avoid Dragon, Cyber Hobby, MiniArt and Hobby Boss until you have a few builds under your belt. Lots of little fiddly pieces and the occasional poor instructions.   I'd avoid Zvezda, RPM, Eastern Express and the like. They may be cheap, but I've heard some horror stories. Again, I wouldn't tackle one of them as a first build.   You could post what you have in mind here, and maybe some others who've built it can tell you their experiences. You can also search the model on ScaleMates for reviews."
modelmakers,34qs9l,35thArmorGuy,5,Mon May 4 00:05:54 2015 UTC,The current go to starter tank right now is Tamiya's M41 Walker Bulldog. It's less than $20 and very simple but builds into a nice looking piece. If you want to step up a bit Dragon's Cyberhobby kits are around $30-$40 and are a definite increase in complexity but still reasonably priced.
modelmakers,34qs9l,showmethebiggirls,3,Sun May 3 23:59:53 2015 UTC,Tamiya has great cheap but detailed kits for beginners like the M41 Walker Bulldog or the Panzer II.
modelmakers,34qs9l,plqamz,3,Mon May 4 01:43:02 2015 UTC,"Yep, Tamiya. Any of their 1/35 scale tanks under $20 will fit well and look pretty good when you're done.   I've been building their Panzer II ausf F/G here:  http://www.reddit.com/r/modelmakers/wiki/buildalongs"
modelmakers,34qs9l,solipsistnation,2,Mon May 4 01:55:24 2015 UTC,I started off with some cheap 1/72 Revell kits. They are nice kits for their price and turn out well. That or find some old Tamiya 1/35 tanks. Those go for 20 sometimes.
modelmakers,34qs9l,HeckleMagpie,2,Sun May 3 22:17:07 2015 UTC,The tamiya walker bulldog. If you have a hobby lobby near you you can score it extra cheap they have a 40% off coupon that's good on anything in the store that's not marked down. The coupon is always good
modelmakers,34qs9l,z71patt,2,Mon May 4 03:51:39 2015 UTC,1/72 scale models are much cheaper though 1/35 has greater detail. You'll also have to take into consideration how big you want your models to be.
modelmakers,34qs9l,uggmun,2,Mon May 4 04:17:59 2015 UTC,Trumpeter 1/35 KV1 1939 Mod. Comes with a metal gun barrel and plastic tracks(molded to have track sag and easier to assemble than Vinyl or individual track links)  also some PE parts. Teaches you how to use aftermarkets and also cheap.
modelmakers,34qs9l,Destructias_Warlord,3,Mon May 4 05:05:45 2015 UTC,I would also recommend the Tamiya M41 Walker Bulldog in 1/35 scle.

modelmakers,34qs9l,ggorgg,1 point,Sun May 3 21:12:04 2015 UTC,"Maybe look at the Tamiya 1/48th scale tanks. They are quick to build and not too big, so you aren't using a lot of resources to finish them, but they're not so small as to be too fiddly.  Some have die cast lower hulls for satisfying weight. You can learn a lot of building an painting skills on these in a short time . They are good for learning new skills on as they are fairly cheap and not too hard."
modelmakers,34qs9l,Charlie-Green-Rug,1 point,Mon May 4 06:06:06 2015 UTC,"If you shop around, you can find plenty of reasonably priced models in any scale and period that interest you. More importantly, make sure you get the right tools. The right kind of glue, some good side cutters, a hobby knife, somewhere to work as a bare minimum. If the hobby grabs you, and you get into painting as well as building, well, the cost of the models may be the least of your worries when compared to the equipment and tools!"
modelmakers,34qs9l,plasticaddict,1 point,Mon May 4 08:52:48 2015 UTC,As others have said: Tamiya Walker Bulldog or Panzer II from local hobby lobby with coupon.

modelmakers,34ppf9,BadJokeHD,4,Sun May 3 13:01:54 2015 UTC,Nice details on the figure.  Faces and figures are one of my many weaknesses in modeling.
modelmakers,34ppf9,84mg09,2,Sun May 3 15:59:27 2015 UTC,"Thank you, but I could have put some more effort into it and paint the rank insignia.  I even thought about painting the eyebrows.   Luckily there were 4 more infantry figures in the set I can practice on."
modelmakers,34ppf9,frugm1,3,Sun May 3 19:56:10 2015 UTC,"This is my third paintjob and my first 1:35 build. I'm very satisfied by the tamiya quality and I learned quite a bit.   The commander was tricky to paint, but I think I've got the techniques. First the eyes, then thes lips and then everything else. And paint the attachments first before glueing.  This was also the first time I used priming and I experimentes with different coats. I don't have an airbrush, so I have to do it all by hand. As you can see on the last picture I coated the back of the tank first with tamiya german grey and then applied the desert camouflage on that. I think you can see the difference between the front and the back of the vehicle.  What is yet to come"
modelmakers,34ppf9,frugm1,3,Sun May 3 13:29:38 2015 UTC,"Looks like a pretty solid build, I like it. Nice job on the guy  Just a few tips.  Put the decals on before weathering, remember originally they were painted/ stenciled on so any dirt built up would be over the lettering and insignia as well.  Brushing is alot more forgiving on tanks than aircraft, but even still thin the paint down and use multiple coats, Vallejo is awesome brushing paint. If thin enough coats are used it can be hard to tell its not airbrushed. Also remember that paint jobs such as white wash were often hand painted in the field, so technically it is historically accurate.  Once I have paint my models whether it be aircraft or tanks I like to apply a gloss coat, I just use a Krylon rattle can. then I apply the decals, this will stop the silvering of the decals and help them lay better. Once this is dried i'll apply another coat of clear gloss to seal it all. Then the weathering begins, if you use oils and mineral spirits  you can apply very light filters of color and dirt. And because you have your gloss coat protecting everything if you don't like it wipe it all off and start again!  Another thing I always do is research, and research, look at pictures online of weather prototypes, even other models people have built. You'll get tons of ideas .  Again, keep at it. Awesome job! Do you plan on making a little base for it or just displaying it as is?"
modelmakers,34ppf9,jalien,3,Sun May 3 14:15:31 2015 UTC,"Thank you for your good advice. I actually didn't weather the model yet, but I don't know if I have the right equipment for it. I'm using a MIG neutral wash.  Regarding the thinning of paint, so I should have done:   Assemble the model Prime normal Grey Basecoat Paint several times with thinned dark yellow   Is that correct?  I put the model on top of my workbench"
modelmakers,34ppf9,frugm1,2,Sun May 3 15:19:54 2015 UTC,"Well any time i'm painting my models, if I was to hand brush that is I would thin my paints directly from the bottle, whether it be basecoat or or top coat.  Did you hand brush the primer or spray? I might add that even though I do have an airbrush when I prime my models again i'll just use krylon grey, black or white primmer. You can buy this at Walmart for like 3 dollars a can, that can will do probably 20 or 30 models. I apologize if your not American i'm just making assumptions. But any automotive, hardware store will sell it.  Priming this way will give you a good smooth base coat to work from.  As far as the Dark yellow. I guess it would all depend on the look you're going for, a lot of modelers prefer aesthetics over historical accuracy, by this I mean lots of pre-shading and post-shading. It looks nice but perhaps not technically accurate. Really it's just a matter of choice.  Anyway sorry for the rant... Basically by thinning the paints you'll get smoother coverage as the paint will flow better.  As far as weathering, again it depends on what look you would like. Again check pictures online of real life prototypes. Think about how the metal would look after years in the desert. There perhaps wouldn't be so much dirt build up. maybe, dust, sand. etc.  I can't speak for these ""weathering"" products myself having not used them before. I personally just use oil paints and chalks not only are they cheaper, will last much longer than a little pot of mig pigments.  This is what I would have done had I tackled the same model using brushes. I have to say i'm no expert and it is just my personal preference.    Assemble the model Prime enough coats of thinned coats of yellow to cover the model. Dry brushed the raised details hard edges with Grey to give the impression of worn top coat. Clear gloss Varnish add decals Clear gloss then weather."

modelmakers,34pnhv,35thArmorGuy,3,Sun May 3 13:25:37 2015 UTC,"The only reason I'm skeptical is because I want to scratch the T-26T using a Hobby Boss kit as the base (I don't want the old RPM or whatever company's kit). I haven't really scratch built before, so there is the chance of massive failure.   But then again, I could use the turret from the kit and make a T-26 turret emplacement. That could be easier.   Oh, if anyone knows how to replicate rivets in 1/35 scale, I'd like to hear about it."

Stretch sprue is the other way I'd suggest."

Anyway, here it is, gloss coated and with some pin washes, ready for oils and chalk and dull coat.

I thought to myself, huh what a break from previous hard builds. 4 days on and assembling was complete and when the first coat are painted then I realize the level difficulty of painting the camo was. It was not as hard as a modern fighter, but placing the blutack properly to avoid air gaps took 2 days for me.  And also, does anyone has any tips regarding painting the tin frames on clear canopies? I did it by cutting masking tape into small squares and triangles to cover the clear parts. This process alone was a nightmare!  Plastic kits were in good shape, almost Tamiya quality. The only drawback was the plastic didn't fit at the forehead (the 3 bulges just above the red nosecon). But it wasn't something that cannot be easily fixed."
modelmakers,34lxah,Anonieme_Angsthaas,6,Sat May 2 09:35:39 2015 UTC,"Ooh, nice!  On painting canopies: There are probably three ways to paint the frame:   Don't Mask them, either with masking tape or with pre-cut masks Hand paint them, but you'll need a good fine brush and brain surgeon-like steady hands Remove the frames and re-create the frame with masking tape (see Paul Buzidk's video on that below)   Paul Budzik's tutorial on masking canopies shows a few options on masking canopies. Some of the techniques he uses are a bit.. extreme (like option #4). But he explains them well with a bit of theory. I learned a lot from this video, even though I don't use most of the techniques he uses, but I want to try the bare-metal foil method just because it seems easier to do then just mask it with masking tape.

World War II of article  RMS Queen Mary:       In late August 1939, Queen Mary was on a return run from New York to Southampton. The international situation led to her being escorted by the battlecruiser HMS Hood. She arrived safely, and set out again for New York on 1 September. By the time she arrived, the Second World War had started and she was ordered to remain in port alongside Normandie until further notice. In March 1940 Queen Mary and Normandie were joined in New York by Queen Mary‍‍ '​‍s new running mate Queen Elizabeth, fresh from her secret dash from Clydebank. The three largest liners in the world sat idle for some time until the Allied commanders decided that all three ships could be used as troopships (Normandie was destroyed by fire during her troopship conversion). Queen Mary left New York for Sydney, Australia, where she, along with several other liners, was converted into a troopship to carry Australian and New Zealand soldiers to the United Kingdom.

modelmakers,34mtsy,flounderflound,8,Sat May 2 16:21:46 2015 UTC,Dragon has been putting out kits for a long time.  The newer ones are generally top notch but the older ones range from pretty good to downright terrible.
modelmakers,34mtsy,Aiglos_and_Narsil,5,Sat May 2 17:30:26 2015 UTC,"This is the answer, the He-219 kit is from 1991, a time when Dragon was a new company, and when the technology of molding was a lot different and less precise than today.  Get any modern dragon kit from after ~2004 or so and you will find they are fantastic, albeit with poor instructions, but the part quality is almost always excellent in their modern kits.   Their also one of the only companies that make ""all-inclusive"" kits that include photo etch, metal gun barrels, and individual track links."
modelmakers,34mtsy,FlyingSMonster,8,Sat May 2 17:50:43 2015 UTC,"This is why we always tell newcomers (I believe it's in the Wiki as well) to refrain from automatically associating quality with particular companies.

Their Atlanta class cruisers, for example, date from the days of Matchbox for their hull and superstructure, despite newer edition coming with excellent new-mold weapons and PE. Their Arleigh Burke destroyers, being molds from now-defunct companies, are also inferior to the Trumpeter/Hobby-Boss' offering. On the other hand, their in-house designed/made kits of WWII USN and German destroyers are the best in the world, and many times superior in detailing and accuracy compared to the Trumpeter stuff."

modelmakers,34l4wl,Eilelwen,3,Sat May 2 02:54:11 2015 UTC,"The beauty of wood deck overlays is that you can paint the deck fittings before fitting the deck overtop, so you don't have to worry about masking or carefully painting the fittings. However, as I recall, Pontos has you remove a lot of the plastic fittings so you can fit their resin and brass replacements in their place. If that's the case with you, then do the removal, paint where they used to be, and then put the wood on top before putting the fittings on. This is so you don't get any bare plastic showing.   I would put the wood deck on before you start working on the superstructure too much. Here and here are photos of modellers who were at the stage where they put the deck on with minimum amount of superstructure work done.  When painting the plastic deck's fittings, make sure not to put too much paint on unnecessarily over the rest of it deck - it may hinder the wood deck's adhesive from sticking well. Some modelers don't trust the adhesive that comes with wood decks, and have solved them via a more roundabout method."

modelmakers,34k9ug,Definitely_Not_Lemon,6,Fri May 1 21:53:01 2015 UTC,"Study the instructions and dry-fit the parts whenever possible, CH/Dragon is notorious for their instructions with a lot of steps cramped in one page and at least one wrong letter/number combination  Assemble the hull with the suspensions, road wheels and return rollers. Leave the idler and the sprocket wheel aside for a moment. Sherman tanks do not have any ""skirt"" or mud covers on the sides, it will be easy to slip the tracks in place once everything is assembled. Or you can assemble the kit following the instructions, but keep in mind that you need to paint the lower part of the hull before you assemble the tracks, or you will not be able to paint some areas. There are two ""ways"" to assemble tools (axes, shovels, cleaning rods, ...): [A], assemble everything on the hull, paint the hull and then retouch the handles and thngs like that or [B], assemble the hull, paint it, paint the parts separately, assemble the parts at the end, before the matt coat. I prefer the [B] mode, it gives me more control on the single parts but it's more difficult to achieve an uniform color between the hull and the supports (usually molded with the tool). I prefer to keep every prone-to-break part separated until the last time (turret machinegun, antennas, ...). Drybrush is your friend, but don't exaggerate it! A simple drybrush on the corners and more exposed areas will be enough.

modelmakers,34kx4a,TheWharf1,4,Sat May 2 01:32:41 2015 UTC,"Yes, you can. I've done this several times with good results.   Mix a small amount of Tamiya paint with some water and liquid dish detergent. The water thins the paint so it goes runny, and the dish detergent reduces the paint's adhesive quality as well as cuts the surface tension of the water so the mixture will flow. You can use a lot of dish detergent for a true ""sludge"" or you can go light with the detergent for a more traditional flowing ""wash.""  Apply this over a smooth surface, wait for it to dry, and remove excess with a dry cotton swab. Since the mixture is just water and soap, there aren't any harsh chemicals that will eat through paint layers or clear coats so you don't have to worry about ruining anything. Just make sure the surface you apply the wash to is smooth. It's hard to remove when applied over a gritty finish. It helps to apply a layer of gloss coat (oil or acrylic based) first.  EDIT: http://www.finescale.com/~/media/import/files/pdf/d/9/f/quickeasyweathering.pdf  In that article, the author uses Polly Scale water based acrylics, but Tamiya acrylics work as well using exactly the same procedure."

The only thing that should ever put you off them is the price, but even then, I would argue that every modeller should treat themselves to at least one of Tamiya's 1/32 kits (Spitfire/Mustang/new Corsair/F-14/F-15) - they really are the pinnacle of large-scale modelling.   If you don't want to spend that much though, go for 1/48, and either go for Eduard, Tamiya, or new Airfix (Mk.I/V) in that order. The new Airfix offerings are fantastic, but lack the finesse of the Eduard & Tamiya kits in my opinion.   If you've not got any Spitfires in your collection, I would argue that either the Mk.Ia, the Mk.V, or the Mk.IX are the quintessential Spitfire variants. However, if you're not too concerned, I would highly recommend the 1/48 Airfix Seafire FR.47/48. It's cheap, but it is an amazing kit, and definitely stands out from the average Spitfire variant."

modelmakers,34iugo,plqamz,3,Fri May 1 17:10:32 2015 UTC,"I need to find a proper way to apply decals. The last few times I've done it I put the decal in warm water, apply Testors decal set to the area I'm going to put it, apply the decal, then brush more decal set on top of that and let it dry. This ends up with the decal still being able to be easily rubbed off and I've started just using a coat of Dullcote to seal the decals on."
modelmakers,34iugo,Timmyc62,4,Fri May 1 15:49:40 2015 UTC,"Decal set does not seal the decal in - it merely softens the decal so it conforms to the surface better. You still need a final coat (dull or gloss, depending on subject) to seal the decal in.  So the process goes, from first layer to last (excludes weathering):  paint  gloss coat to provide smooth surface for decals (prevents silvering)  decal  decal set   dull or gloss sealing coat"
modelmakers,34iugo,willkinton247,1 point,Fri May 1 16:52:09 2015 UTC,"Would you use a dull coat after decaling on top of a metallic paint finish, like the bare metal USAAF fighters of WWII?"

modelmakers,34iugo,Flabergie,1 point,Fri May 1 23:03:52 2015 UTC,One thing I have been doing for years is mixing a little Microscale Crystal Clear into the setting solution.  It's basically glue that dries perfectly clear.  I first started doing this when I had some old decals that just wouldn't  stick and it worked like a charm.  I mix it on single use basis and just enough so solution looks a little milky.  Rough estimate about 10/1 mix

It's not my intention to diminish your effort but:   The finish of the paint is not ok, it's too thick and the airbrush spits crystals on the model (but i liked your ""panel picking"", usually ignored but it gives to the model an unique ""used"" look) You can see brushmarks on the weathering (and some panel line washes are still ""raw""). This may be ok from a distance, but once you get closer it's just ""messy"""

The trick is finding an interested/wealthy buyer.   For OP, the problem would be shipping - there's no really good way to ship these delicate items with any guarantee that they'll arrive in one piece. Ideally, find a buyer in your city so it can be delivered/picked up in person. Ebay is worth trying, but OP might also try asking around at their local museums, hobby shops, and art supply stores for ideas on local venues to sell the models."
modelmakers,34iz7c,Timmyc62,2,Fri May 1 16:50:07 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the input guys.    Selling local would be ideal but I'm from a small town in NL so I think selling via internet is the best way to find someone interested.    Shipping is indeed problematic but I think it can be done using styrofoam to fixate the model in a small box, which is inside a larger box.    I was also thinking to add some background/history of the models, like where they where used and who flew them, on a DVD or USB stick.     I'm gonna try Ebay.  My sister said I should use Facebook too but I don't have an account there. Do you guys know if there are FB-groups specialized in buying/selling models?"
modelmakers,34iz7c,alaskafish,3,Fri May 1 17:55:46 2015 UTC,"Go on eBay and look at all the finished models.  It's a tough market. Mainly because people are charging ridiculous prices for down right crappy models.   I saw this one that was a lot of four old Airfix kits. Hand painted, paint was very clumpy, parts were falling off, horrible build, and so forth.   They had the nerve to ask $200 plus $20 shipping. Sometimes, I don't know if people really know what things are worth there.     Selling models is something that is of a niche market. Not many people want to buy them unless they're incredibly good. Something you'd put on a Desk of some CEO of a big company good.   Most likely, the models you want to sell aren't good. Don't take it as an insult. I don't think anyone's but a few people here could sell their finished models for anything more than a profit.   If you are going to go through the trouble of selling them, make sure you do it for dirt cheap. Maybe some kid wants a tank for a diorama for a class project. Even if the things you built were very nice, you won't be able to sell them more than you payed.     I've sold some models. Mainly to small Museums in my area. I only sold one for more than the actual kit cost. I spend about $40 bucks on a 1/35 T95, and sold it for $60. Other than that, the other models I sold were for 25% less than the kit cost me."

modelmakers,34im0i,willkinton247,3,Fri May 1 13:48:37 2015 UTC,"Not sure about the primer, but it definitely wouldn't hurt to do the cowling separately and then attach it. Just make sure to remove paint from the areas you are cementing.   The blue painters tape works pretty well as long as you make sure it's attached really well and don't use too much paint. You can get some bleeding through if you really slather it on. Also be gentle when removing tape if you are applying it to painted areas. There is a chance that it could take paint with it. It's unlikely but I have seen it happen. Best thing would be to let the paint dry really well before taping up the next area."

modelmakers,34im0i,HughJorgens,1 point,Fri May 1 23:30:52 2015 UTC,"Metallic paints have a tendency to not stick as well as other paints, so it is usually better to do the o/d panel first if you can.  I have never used that spraypaint so I don't know how well it sticks. Again to reinforce what Liberator said, you have to watch out for bleedthrough, mist the paint on lightly and keep the can moving at all times.  If it goes on very wet, you are going to have bleedthrough.  Build up the paint over several coats, you have to be very easy with spraypaint, it is so easy to overdo."
modelmakers,34im0i,goondam,2,Sat May 2 00:26:02 2015 UTC,"If you didn't do any puttying or sanding, I wouldn't worry about using primer. My experience with tape and spray paint is kind of hit and miss. You can't spray too heavily because spray paint is mostly solvent and solvents are good at dissolving adhesives. So you have to do light coats. Practice taping and painting on something else first."
modelmakers,34gs3b,MMGeoff,4,Fri May 1 00:46:17 2015 UTC,"Wow.  Very very nice.  Love the post shading. What airbrush did you use? (As you see, I've been posting many posts about detail brushes for doing details like that). Could you go over you're painting process. Did you use a filter, (if so, what type).  And, before I forget. You put the scale in the title. I love you sooooo much now!"
modelmakers,34gs3b,alaskafish,2,Fri May 1 01:00:16 2015 UTC,"The post shading stands out a lot more in the photo than it does in real life. I used an Iwata Eclipse double action, that's my one and only airbrush. It's not a matter of what airbrush, it's just getting the paint flowing right. You can do this with a single action brush if everything is dialed in perfectly. Still, any decent dual action brush, once you get the feel for it, will be the ideal tool for subtle effects and detail work. Just find one that feels right in your hand and isn't an ""el cheapo"" model. It's worth dropping $150-$200 for a good airbrush. It will last you forever if you take care of it.  I just painted the three main colors with no special techniques, and then I lightened the panel centers with a lighter mix of each color. After that, I used a black/burnt umber oil wash for the panel lines. That's it."
modelmakers,34gs3b,alaskafish,1 point,Fri May 1 01:29:41 2015 UTC,"I completely agree about quality airbrushes. I got three, but I want to add a nice fine airbrush like the Krome/Micron/Sotar, but I recently found out they're more for ink rather than model acrylics.   Did you use any After market parts?

I'll often do the rough slathering application inside of cockpits, though."

modelmakers,34hc9l,alaskafish,2,Fri May 1 20:19:50 2015 UTC,"Just to let you know, never take pictures of the model facing a window. It causes the camera to pick up the light and makes the model really hard to see. Even if you're not facing it directly, like in 8, 9, and 10, you cannot see the model that well. The model should stick out from the surface.  All thought, the camo scheme came out pretty great for a freehand. All you need is to focus on the model, take a picture away from the light, and boom; amazing.  And kudos for the scale in the title."

If memory serves it took me from Christmas until father's day, working on it almost full-time, to build.  I ended up having to find and purchase at least two whole extra kits just to have enough parts that were usable to finish one build. Finding the kits was a nightmare in itself, it's almost as if Revell had been trying to destroy any evidence of the monstrosity. I still shudder thinking about how Ill fitting and brittle so much of the kit was. Revell, you can't mold parts that need to be bent to make them fit together out of chalk, okay?  I posted this album under a previous user name but this is one of the proudest builds I've ever completed because I hate it.   It was just sheer willpower to make it through to the end and I'll never build a ship again.  Ever.  It took me 4 years to even consider modelling again. For my first attempt back from that hiatus I currently have the Tamiya 1/48 F4U-1 sitting on my bench waiting on paints and photo-etch to arrive.   I'll also never buy Revell again.  https://www.dropbox.com/sh/wenchnt9woyafcx/AAC2lZTyfoKE-2ka5fAu9MmWa?dl=0"
modelmakers,34h7ew,Fortunate_0ne,3,Fri May 1 14:19:24 2015 UTC,"I feel like Revell should be considered an average model quality. I've built so many because that's what my dad bought when I was a kid, that I kind of know the ins and outs of them. I'd say a good model kit is anything better than a Revell kit and a bad model kit is anything worse than Revell."
modelmakers,34h7ew,willkinton247,3,Fri May 1 14:25:11 2015 UTC,I don't disagree. I built many Revell kits as a child. The first time I saw kits from Tamiya or Hasegawa I thought that people who built anything of that quality weren't real modelers. Those kits almost fall together. It's just too easy.  Another nightmare kit that I never could finish was an AMT/Ertl Star Trek Enterprise (NCC 1701-A with lights and sound effects) that I attempted as a 13 year old in the mid 90s. Those warp nacelles were mounted to the hull by what was basically flash. I spent hours painting it and could never get the warp drives to stay on. That kit hurt me bad.
modelmakers,34h7ew,Fortunate_0ne,2,Fri May 1 14:42:06 2015 UTC,"I'm building my first Tamiya kit now, and I'm amazed at the quality. It's got me scared because I feel like the bar for what the finished product could look like has been raised significantly.   Edit: I'm thinking back to the kits that were just nightmares for me, and I'm starting to remember what kits just gave me issue after issue. The Revell 1/48 AH-64 and 1/48 F-4 Phantom were just absolutely terrible for me. I think that was more due to my skill though. A few years ago I tried the Revell 1/48 A-10 and I couldn't get past the cockpit. The fuselage would just not fit together, no matter how hard I tried."
modelmakers,34h7ew,willkinton247,3,Fri May 1 14:46:58 2015 UTC,"Revell is to modelling what McDonald's is to dining. They both serve an important function, but few would argue that ""quality"" is that function.   Don't get me wrong, I've seen Revell builds that were better than anything I could do given the best kits with unlimited resources.

modelmakers,34h7ew,Fortunate_0ne,3,Fri May 1 14:56:40 2015 UTC,"To be honest though, even though a bulk of my modeling experience took place before I got into high school, I feel like I definitely learned a whole lot through trial and error on those Revell kits. They're so readily available and cheap enough to allow for a lot of people to get into building models."
modelmakers,34h7ew,MadMorf,1 point,Fri May 1 15:02:18 2015 UTC,"Totally agree. From ages 5 to 20 I would say that 95% of my kits were Revell/Monogram, with 4% being Testors and the remaining 1% being ""other"". All of those kits were relatively cheap and readily accessible. I knew nothing else, and loved it. I learned the basics and had a blast.   I have fond memories of saving my lawn mowing money, riding my bike to Wal Mart, and buying a new kit.

I didn't mess up any of the clear parts, I had no glue meltdowns, And the paint was applied pretty evenly. I'm still proud of that build. I think it's in my grandma's attic...  Other Revell kits that stand out to me were the 1/48 P-40 which was the first kit that I was able to paint a camouflage scheme that didn't look like crap. I completely botched the canopy on that one though. I followed that up with the AV-8B, which I also got an awesome camo paint scheme on, and the canopy was mostly intact, but I later realized that I put the horizontal stabilizers on upside down."

Talk about a twisted and mangled garbage pile. Part of it may have been the way it had been shipped and stored before I bought it (the box was a little bent up), but there were other things. The underside of the elevator was stamped Revell 1977 (or Monogram, I don't remember). It was an absolute re-box with crappy old molds. The two fuselage halves weren't even the same size. It was a catastrophic disaster - how I even managed to get the damned thing together is beyond me.  Here are some slightly fuzzy pictures of the finished product. Pic 1 Pic 2"

The other Revell is American and is descended from the 60s and 70s model company. They keep their old molds churning out kits, some of which are WAY behind modern injection-molding capabilities.

modelmakers,34g604,Plundersquirrel,4,Thu Apr 30 21:39:03 2015 UTC,"Hopefully you have an airbrush.  I like to use the hairspray technique for whitewash.  That's what I used on my goofy little Jeep from last year.  Basically, you paint your base coat, lay a thin coat of aerosol hairspray down on it, then thin white paint over that.  Once that's done you take a lightly wet, clean, stiff brush and start rubbing at the white paint.  The water from the brush seeps thru white paint and liquefies the hairspray underneath.  The hairspray rubs away, taking the paint with it in a very erratic, in-scale effect.  A couple caveats to consider:   practice on scrap first because... too much hairspray will cause the paint to slough off in sheets too little hairspray and you'll have to scrub like mad to get any paint to break free do not use pump-spray hair spray   This works well for me.  I find that a quick pass from ~18"" works well.  Let the hairspray dry completely (a couple mins) and do a second quick pass.  Let it dry again, then shoot your whitewash.  Let that dry then start using the wet brush.  As far as chipping paint goes, Tamiya works best.  LifeColour supposedly works well too, but I haven't tried it.  Vallejo sucks because it sloughs off in sheets no matter what you do.    Video tutorial - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKeXS0RPs3I"
modelmakers,34g604,Gewehr43,3,Thu Apr 30 22:54:47 2015 UTC,"And if you don't have an airbrush,  I did this with a sponge.   Admittedly not as nice but it is a method.  http://imgur.com/a/B1g6h"

modelmakers,34g604,XenophonTheAthenian,2,Fri May 1 02:30:08 2015 UTC,"Make sure to get a regular or fine spray(like OP links to) hairspray too, many of the 'Extra Strength' and 'Extra Hold' types also spray far more of the liquid than a normal can."

modelmakers,34g604,MMGeoff,3,Fri May 1 05:53:32 2015 UTC,"I've done this once before and I was surprised with the result. I did a white wash on a 1/48 Soviet armored car.  I think what I did was overspray the model with white, I used Tamiya acrylic. Once that was dry, I started beating up the paint with a cotton swab that was slightly dampened with an appropriate thinner, so rubbing alcohol or Tamiya X-20A thinner. The white wash first comes off of raised edges and any high spots, and then as you keep abusing the more ""open"" painted areas, you'll start pulling paint off in larger ""sheets.""   Very, very easy technique. Just make sure you don't use too much thinner in the cotton swab because you don't want pools of thinner forming on your model and you don't want thinned paint running everywhere. So err on the side of ""this is probably too dry of a cotton swab"" as opposed to soaking it.  You'll probably want to have the underlying paint work clear coated with something to protect it from the cotton swab + thinner. If you paint with acrylics, your clear coat will have to be something that won't be diluted by acrylic thinners, so something like a Model Master enamel flat coat would work. I don't think I protected my paint work and I had a little bit of the base color start bleeding into the white wash but overall I thought it looked alright."
modelmakers,34f78z,captainwacky91,4,Thu Apr 30 17:19:50 2015 UTC,"So, from what I can tell, the shells provided with the kit don't look much like any actual shell that would be used in the KwK 37.  It's somewhat close to the 7.5 cm Sprgr.Patr.34, but that's being generous.  The cartridge shoulder is too steep and the area between the obturating bands is way too narrow.  That being said, if they're stored in the ammo box similar to the two build shots you've posted, most of that won't be noticeable.  As for what ammo would be included in the vehicle, I'd imagine you'd have a mix of HE, HEAT, and a few smoke rounds and maybe a few old AP rounds.  By that time in the war, tank armor had improved enough that the solid shot AP rounds would only be effective against lighter armored vehicles.  HEAT, with its penetration not being dependent on muzzle velocity, would probably have been the preferred anti-armor round.  Sorry I can't help on the color front as I haven't found anything indicating what color the projectiles were.  From other model pictures I've seen online, the colors were blue/gray and black.  The cartridge would be brass colored, of course.  Don't drive yourself crazy finding the exact specific shade, though.  ""Standard"" colors were merely reference as color batches were far from consistent, even between production runs at the same plant."

modelmakers,34e8qi,kr0nd1n0,7,Thu Apr 30 12:57:58 2015 UTC,"It's really a mixed process, there's no one-size-fits-all.  Some things are easier to paint on the sprue, small things like grab handles and antennae. But, you'll have to touch them up after removing them from the sprue.  Others, you need to paint after the major pieces are assembled. Fuselage and wings and tails...  There's really no good way around this."
modelmakers,34e8qi,MadMorf,5,Thu Apr 30 13:18:49 2015 UTC,"I absolutely agree with this. You have to play it by ear and do what works best for you. I often paint propellers while still on the sprue because I can spray both sides without ever touching it (and it doesn't blow away). A simple touch of a brush a the attaching point after removal will patch the rest, and if you clearcoat the plane it will even out the inconsistency if there is any."
modelmakers,34e8qi,flounderflound,3,Thu Apr 30 15:19:29 2015 UTC,"Paint like-colored parts as a batch. Usually, I paint the fuselage with an airbrush, and mask the cockpit and landing gear bays. Then, I separate the parts from the tree and use an alligator clip stand (you can get these at places like Harbor Freight or craft stores) to hold the parts and paint smaller pieces with an airbrush or spray can (or even brush paint occasionally). I always hand paint tires. Clear plastic parts are always the trickiest for me, but as long as you mask them correctly, they should turn out alright. Hope this helps!"
modelmakers,34e8qi,Masteroid,3,Thu Apr 30 13:13:47 2015 UTC,If you are filling the seams you have to wait until at least most of it is together before you can paint.
modelmakers,34e8qi,HughJorgens,2,Thu Apr 30 22:47:44 2015 UTC,"Honestly, as you get more experienced, you'll see where it works best to build sub-assemblies before painting and what needs to be painted separately.  Try a little of everything these other guys mentioned, they're all pretty well right."
modelmakers,34e8qi,screamingcheese,2,Thu Apr 30 20:25:31 2015 UTC,"The hard truth is that it comes with experience and there is no formula that applies to all aircraft.  That being said, what I do is typically:  1) paint cockpit parts - I usually have them partially assembled, leaving out the instrument panel, control stick, and (if a jet) the ejection seat  2) Install cockpit fully assembled (sans ejection seat if it's a jet) into the model, and assemble the wings/fuselage as normal. Assemble everything, leaving off propellers, antennae, landing gear, and weapons. Anything that you think you can knock off easily during painting is best left until final assembly unless there's no way around it. Some models, for instance, require you to install the landing gear before the ""painting phase"" would normally take place.  3) Paint the model and all of its remaining ""subassemblies"" like weapons, landing gear, etc.  4) Apply decals  5) ""Weathering phase""  6) Final assembly  7) Final clear coat, finish."
modelmakers,34e8qi,MMGeoff,2,Fri May 1 00:44:20 2015 UTC,"Painting in the sprues is just wrong.  The simple rule is: 'leave it as late as possible to paint'. So paint the cockpit before it becomes inaccessible (ie, before you close up the fuselage). Jet intakes, wheel wells and so on as well. I also paint intakes black early on. I leave off parts I will break off, like bombs and pitot tubes.  Just look at some in progress builds on various modelling sites and you'll pretty quickly become enlightened."
modelmakers,34e8qi,llordlloyd,1 point,Fri May 1 01:53:36 2015 UTC,"Painting in the sprues is just wrong.   This partially depends on the part and on where the gates are located.   For example I like to cut all the gates from landing gears except for the gate that is attached to the alignment pin (if it's available, the landing gears of my last model had gates all over the body of the part, not one in an hidden spot), so I can use the sprue as a support. Or, in case of instruments panels, I try to keep at least the gate that will be invisible once the panel is installed.   I'd say that painting everything on the sprue is bad, but it has its uses"
modelmakers,34e8qi,ionizzatore,2,Fri May 1 19:46:32 2015 UTC,"I meant doing the whole model. Certainly we all paint parts on the sprue. I especially do wheels, after sanding off the mould seam."

modelmakers,34e4te,alaskafish,2,Thu Apr 30 12:23:00 2015 UTC,"The Sotar is better suited for inks and such.  My IPMS group has two members who use the Sotar.  They're both large-scale figure painters (think busts, sci-fi/fantasy, etc), and use it for adding the sunburst lines in eyes and for veins under the surface of skin, things like that, and use other 'brushes for larger area coverage.  Not good for moving paint thicker than alcohol or for base-coating.  The Iwata Eclipse and the Krome are going to perform very similarly.  Having only used the Renegade (which isn't too shabby), I can't speak with certainty on the Krome.  However, I have an Eclipse and an HP-C+ from Iwata, and I love them both.  The Eclipse has been the single most flexible airbrush I've ever used, and if I had to give up the rest of my 'brushes, I'd probably keep that one."
modelmakers,34e4te,screamingcheese,1 point,Thu Apr 30 13:43:44 2015 UTC,So what would you recommend for a good detail brush. I need fine lines and such. Not going to use it for primers and base cotes.
modelmakers,34e4te,screamingcheese,1 point,Thu Apr 30 14:20:40 2015 UTC,"Like I said, I'm pretty sure that the Krome and the Iwata Eclipse are going to be very similar in performance, from my experience.    With my Eclipse, I've done squiggle camo on 1/72 armor and aircraft without issue, as well as done primers, base-coats, and automotive clear-coats.  I can go down to roundabout .5mm spray pattern with a little bit of effort, and just shy of 1mm pattern with very little effort.  On the other end of the spectrum, I can get about 2-3cm running wide-open.    When I first started off, I had it in my head that I needed the absolute finest detail 'brush money could buy, and I tried quite a few 'brushes, including something that's similar in performance to the Sotar.  In the end, I realized it's very easily possible to do everything I needed with just one airbrush - I just needed to get the right one, and MOST importantly, LEARN HOW TO USE IT CORRECTLY.  That's when I snagged me the HP-C +.  After what was probably five years of near-daily use, I started having air-valve issues with it.  Not wanting to be without a 'brush, I got an Eclipse, and set aside the HP-C+ until I could ship it back to Iwata for an overhaul.  The Eclipse turned out to have a much better range of performance with heavier paints and acrylics, so I put off sending in the HP-C+.    Fast forward three years, I snagged an ultrasonic cleaner at Harbor Freight on a coupon.  On a whim, I tossed my HP-C+ in it, ran it through three times, then hooked it up, ran lacquer thinner through it, then tried out some Model Master flat black.  It was like I had a new airbrush again!  So, long-ass reply later, for my money I'd say you're already on the right track with either the Eclipse or the Krome, and practice!  If for some reason you decide you want to do an He-219 in 1/144th scale with the night-fighter squiggle camo, snag an HP-C+, and call a psychiatrist."
modelmakers,349wup,w4lter,13,Wed Apr 29 13:42:12 2015 UTC,"Here's a great way to find out - on Ebay, you can search for completed auctions.    As an example, I searched for ""hasegawa Emily"" in completed, and got these results:  http://www.ebay.com/sch/Toys-Hobbies-/220/i.html?_from=R40&_nkw=hasegawa+emily&LH_Complete=1&rt=nc  If the listing is in green, it sold at the price you see.  If it's in black, it didn't sell.  You can plug the kit manufacturer and name in at top, on the search bar, and get this info for any of the kits in your stash.  If you sell to a dealer, you will get pennies on the dollar.  I work part time at a hobby shop.  If you know anybody that's an Ebay user, they might sell them for you for a portion of the proceeds, and you'd still probably make more than with a dealer or shop."

modelmakers,349wup,flounderflound,5,Wed Apr 29 14:30:56 2015 UTC,"The Lysander is a pretty neat kit.  The Hasegawa 1/72 fighters look to be mostly modern molds, so they're not too shabby.    That DML He219 might be worth a bit more than the average kit, as is the Do335B-6 - these aren't often re-issued.    Aside from that, I'd say about 1/3rd of this stash is going to be really hard to move, except to the occasional collector or guy wanting a trip down memory lane.  In those cases, there's either more modern kits available, or they've been re-released quite often and there's a bit of market saturation (ie., the Italeri multi-engined ones).    This might be a long shot, but if you're looking to move them as a lot, contact the guy at http://charliesplasticmodels.com/.

I can't help with the Sotar but I can probably put a vote behind the Badger Renegade Krome RK-1. I pretty much only build 1/72 scale armor and have the lower modeled Badger Renegade Velocity R1V.   I have not had any problems with the Velocity with regards to fine-line work or base coating 1/72 kits and MG Gundam kits. The Velocity has the 0.21mm tip and needle, THIS is one reason I say go for the Krome, as it has both the 0.21mm and 0.33mm and doesn't cost much more on sales. It also has a thumb rest, finer trigger lock, and is a little nicer overall (I think the Velocity looks cooler though with it's black chrome plating, and as a graphic designer, I'll live with the few shortcomings of the R1V for aesthetics haha)."

I only have the one 0.21mm needle, so I can't speak absolutely, definitively on the 0.19mm needle. However I did a bunch of googling around and found this relevant review. Ctrl+F on that page for ""Ink"" and you'll find a relevant paragraph claiming the 0.21mm is for ink and the 0.33mm is for thicker paints.  Now, I have been using paints perfectly fine with a 0.21mm tip and the only times I get clogging are when I rush a color change and don't properly thin my paints or use Alclad's ""pre-thinned"" black primer (it clogs more than the gray, no idea why). I'd be concerned that a 0.19mm tip would clog more. An airbrush is a tool, it can only do so much for you on it's own.   Sotar has a .19, .22, and .33 needle. Wouldn't it be a good airbrush for this then?  I say this because, Amazon has a sale where the Sotar is cheaper than the Krome, Velocity, Patriot, and so forth.   I'm sure you are aware that it's only available with those three sizes, unlike the Krome however, it only comes in one of those three sizes. On amazon, the tip, needle, regulator come out to about $56 for each other size (""medium"" and ""large""). The Krome comes with two tip sizes already, I'd argue it's cheaper overall."
modelmakers,34cwdc,Destructias_Warlord,1 point,Thu Apr 30 17:43:07 2015 UTC,Get something that is built for models like tamiya or gunze sangyo. Some of the newer tamiya brushes can spray smaller than 1mm
modelmakers,34cwdc,jayadan,3,Thu Apr 30 03:39:00 2015 UTC,An airbrush is an airbrush. The Gunze and Tamiya airbrushes are manufactured by the same people who make brushes for Iwata. There's nothing about those airbrushes that speak specifically to the modeling market aside from brand name.   One downside to buying one of those airbrushes (as opposed to Iwata or Badger) is that you might have a harder time finding replacement parts as the number of places that carry them are very small.
modelmakers,34cwdc,TheGreatCthulhu,1 point,Thu Apr 30 11:21:43 2015 UTC,"See, that's was my exact thought.   I didn't think that an Airbrush made by a modeling company would be any different to one made by an Airbrush company. Sure, different ones have different paint types it allows, but still.   My issue, is that I was about to purchase the Sotar, but I read one review saying you needed ink and not acrylic paint. And that's exactly what I'd be spraying.  Does anyone here have a Sotar and care to chime in about it's practicality in modeling?"
modelmakers,34cwdc,jayadan,1 point,Thu Apr 30 11:28:04 2015 UTC,"I've had a Sotar for about 15 years. I only use acrylics. I only have the fine needle. I've just had it back from repair at Badger for a replacement teflon seal and new tip. Cost me $18 plus shipping from Ireland. I don't use it a huge amount, and I also have a Testors Aztec about 5 years longer. I mostly use  Liquitex  paints thinned. OH, and I got a brand new Wiltex auto-stop compressor that I I think is awesome compared to my 20 year old POS.  The Sotar is a fine airbrush. Acrylics will always clog any airbrush. The Sotar requires very careful cleaning.  The Aztec is a bit more forgiving but I find the needles increasingly difficult to find. The Sotar is capable of extremely fine lines. I've just got some Liquitex airbrush medium as I think I've not been careful enought about my thinner.  The question for me, with experience of only these two airbrushes is: is the Sotar overkill in capability for modelling, since I don't have a huge requirement for extra fine lines (for me, probably). Only you can answer that for yourself and if it's on sale, that may help justify it."
modelmakers,34cwdc,Destructias_Warlord,1 point,Thu Apr 30 20:26:09 2015 UTC,"I don't have that airbrush, but I have an Iwata Custom Micron and it has an incredibly fine tip (.18mm - the Sotar is .2mm). People also say that you can't shoot paint through it and that it is strictly for ink - but I can tell you that this is not true.  On the other hand, shooting paint through it is more difficult than it is with an airbrush of a larger needle size. Clogging can happen more frequently and for that reason cleaning is much more of a chore as well. My standard airbrush for modeling work (and I work primarily with small scale miniatures) is the Iwata Eclipse. It's needle is .35mm - much larger than the custom micron, and yet I do 95% of my work with this airbrush - and it's a lot less of a pain to use."
modelmakers,34azps,TH3USAF76,5,Wed Apr 29 18:36:22 2015 UTC,I just painted some rubber tracks on my halftrack and it seemed to work fine (mind you I was brushing not spraying). They will look fine after weathering and mudding if you choose to go for that look
modelmakers,34azps,RazorShurikens,3,Wed Apr 29 18:43:11 2015 UTC,Agreed. I used to use rattle cans on tracks successfully.  The only time it didn't work well may have been due to me not washing them off first.  It seems the rubber can get a coat of something oily on it that messes with paint.
modelmakers,34azps,84mg09,2,Wed Apr 29 18:49:25 2015 UTC,I'll be sure to wash it now.
modelmakers,34azps,Aiglos_and_Narsil,5,Wed Apr 29 19:32:38 2015 UTC,"Dragon's DS plastic seems to take paint better than just plain vinyl.  I've used Tamiya rattlecans on it with no trouble.  I prime, paint, and weather the track off the tank and then use superglue to attach.  Do some test fitting before you do anything else though, most of the time the track will be a link or two longer than it should be."

modelmakers,34atra,EM2Hero,5,Wed Apr 29 17:54:03 2015 UTC,"My first airbrush was a Masters and it was temptingly cheap. I ignored some of the other advise on here to buy the Iwata and be done with it.  The Masters got me through about 8 models and whether through my ignorance or product failure, I could not get that thing to do what I wanted.  So I finally bought an Iwata and am still learning the ends and outs of it.  My opinion is that I would not buy the Masters and save for an Iwata or Badger or a ""higher end"" option.  That kit is temptingly cheap though :)"
modelmakers,34atra,84mg09,1 point,Wed Apr 29 18:26:41 2015 UTC,"Thanks, yea I've been worried about the listing price being too tempting."
modelmakers,34atra,alaskafish,3,Wed Apr 29 19:16:52 2015 UTC,"It's a question over Quality over Quantity.   You either buy one really good airbrush, or many cheap. At the end of the day, you'll spend the same amount of money, and be disappointed in the cheaper airbrushes since they didn't atomize and spray well. And you could save your self the trouble of buying and being disappointed in spray patterns if you just bought a nice Badger or Iwata."
modelmakers,34atra,wolfamongyou,2,Thu Apr 30 01:01:24 2015 UTC,I got the Masters airbrush kit with compressor after Christmas as a gift from my wife and it has served me well so far. After I got it I read a review saying that it requires a lot more cleaning and upkeep which is true - I found that paint will infiltrate back deep and down to the recesses of the airbrush - however as long as I've kept it clean and I make sure to disassemble it fully and clean it fully everytime I use it it is continue to work well. However the airbrush seem to have rubber seals and I don't know how well that would take up to anything very corrosive so that would be something to watch for and I've never sprayed lacquer I've only used acrylic so far and some enamel ( testors / model master ).   So far I've had no problems but your mileage may vary. Some places will offer a warranty so go for that and you should be fine.
modelmakers,34atra,thatg33kgirl,2,Thu Apr 30 01:54:59 2015 UTC,"My first airbrush was a Masters kit (a gift) with the dual action brush. Since I didn't know if I'd even like airbrushing and was just starting, it really was the right fit for me. Sure, it wasn't the best, and in the end the trigger literally broke in two because the metal was so cheap, but by the time it broke I was ready to buy a new one anyways! I still use the air compressor and the kit I got came with some paint too (Createx) which I use ALL the time!  I now have a Paasche talon and it is MUCH better in quality and doesn't clog as much, but I don't regret starting with the cheap knock-off brand just to learn. To each their own of course!"

Looks like the Civil Guard acquired a handful of ex-Texas ANG Mustangs for $1 each, during the attempted Nicaraguan invasion of CR in 1955, and that's where this aircraft comes from.  Edit: the Nicaraguan invasion was at the instigation of the losing president Calderon in the Civil War, so I guess it could be considered part of the Civil War."

They look good more than they are functional really, if you wanted to display the tank going over uneven ground you'd probably have to cut the springs as the weight of the plastic isn't enough to hold them  down like it would be with the weight of the real vehicle.   On the real tank, the spring is really a set of three or four nested springs.   There's a great cutaway drawing in one of my reference books that I can't seem to find online anywhere."

modelmakers,34a6ai,ionizzatore,2,Thu Apr 30 14:16:55 2015 UTC,"Yes PVA glue is wood/white glue.  I asked because i use PVA glue to ""reinforce"" CA glue bonds[*] and canopies, and i was worried that something may fall apart with the next humid day.  [*] CA glue is hard and fast to cure, but it's very brittle, so i started to put really tiny amount of CA glue to fix the parts in place (landing gear doors, for example) and then i run heavily thinned PVA glue along the junction. PVA glue is more resilient to twist and pull, no more ""snapped and fell in the mounth of the Carpet Monster"" :D"
modelmakers,34a6ai,bobbotlawsbotblog,3,Thu Apr 30 15:05:11 2015 UTC,"I think PVA is a bit stronger than standard Elmer's white glue. Realistically, I wouldn't worry about humidity once the glue is set. Of course plain white glue would prob just be pretty weak."

I didn't want to buy decal applicant or future as this being my first build I'd need only a few mL, so I used the only other fast drying, glossy finish I had, clear nail polish.

German gunners quickly learned to aim for the star since they were more likely to cause the ammo to cook off, destroying the M4.  On later M4s, they welded an extra steel plate over that spot, but still painted a white star right on it, and since German guns were typically pretty good at poking holes in tanks, they still aimed at the same spot and still cooked off the ammo. US tank crews couldn't paint over the stars necessarily, but they started smearing mud on them to disguise them a little.

It's just what most of us (me included) like the most, but you can achieve great results with anything. There are people that brush paint their kits, and they look great. It just takes practice, skill and patience. (like Patience, Skill is always sold out the second a shop stocks it) Rattle cans are just fine, but they get a little expensive, especially the Tamiya cans which are a bit small. But they are well worth the money.  Anyway, there is no true DAK paint. Most brands sell it as German Yellow, but you can use most colors similar to that because of the fading the paint on the real vehicle would have suffered. The desert sun isn't nice for paint.."

modelmakers,3499ck,Joey92LX,3,Thu Apr 30 06:45:24 2015 UTC,"Sorry OP I didnt mean to come across all bossy, haha. I wrote this as I was falling asleep. I had a similar issue when trying to find a deep pearl lime green for a model. Ones that I thought would be close to the effect I wanted were really expensive (automotive paints) or unavailable in the US (Zero Paints look awesome). I also wanted to only use acrylics and I didn't want to use a rattle can. I did a lot of research online but couldnt find anything that I was happy with. I came across a discussion board where someone suggested this technique I shared with you and it was perfect for what I was trying to accomplish.  http://www.therpf.com/f9/color-over-chrome-paint-73575/  http://floch5.com/chameleon.htm  Check out the last spoon on the right: http://i187.photobucket.com/albums/x130/pharr7226/Paint%20Tests/006.jpg Picture came from this forum: http://www.modelcarsmag.com/forums/?showtopic=22568  Not as dark as the example you provided but getting close.   Here is the dark green candy/pearl I was able to get:  http://i.imgur.com/jt44ts6.jpg  http://i.imgur.com/J1NKgJM.jpg  http://i.imgur.com/RgbKzUZ.jpg  Also those paints aren't terribly expensive but might give you a better option to find the color you want to get.

Cheers mate"
modelmakers,3499ck,Joey92LX,1 point,Thu Apr 30 19:02:25 2015 UTC,one of the things I was thinking to help you achieve that color was potentially using tamiya metallic gray (as it is still metal flake just darker) and spraying some tamiya smoke clear over it as this technique describes. I think it will get that dark tone but still potentially show the metal flake in the metallic gray. I would be interested in seeing color you end up going with! Cheers!
modelmakers,3499ck,screamingcheese,1 point,Fri May 1 02:46:25 2015 UTC,"in addition to the clear smoke, you could also spray some clear blue in areas where you would want the blue highlights to show up! I think it can be done."

modelmakers,346djz,Liberator1177,5,Tue Apr 28 17:40:04 2015 UTC,"First attempt at doing some weathering. I still have quite a bit more to do. Started by laying down some rust colored pigments with an enamel varnish onto the primer, then applied Maskol to the areas I wanted chipped paint to be. I used a small brush and the abrasive part of a pot scrubber sponge to do this. I then applied the green top coat of acrylic paint. Then it's just a matter of removing the maskol. I found a fingernail or the blunt end of a paintbrush along with a stiff brush worked pretty well. Next step is to use a brush with enamel thinner to cause the rust to run over the outer coat. Also going to start with the dark grime wash and some dirt here and there."

modelmakers,3489yh,Timmyc62,2,Thu Apr 30 03:20:28 2015 UTC,"A good beginner's kit is Trumpeter's 1/350 USS England (review here), a World War Two destroyer escort. It builds well out-of-the-box, while retaining some of the intricacies that you'll have to deal with for more complex subjects later (such as PE), but still keeping a simple single-tone paint scheme and fairly small size to make things simpler. It's also fairly cheap."

modelmakers,3489yh,llordlloyd,2,Thu Apr 30 04:03:29 2015 UTC,"The England kit is around 26cm long.  1/144 limits you in terms of subject choices. If you want a collection in the same scale, I would stick to 1/350 and 1/700. That said, there are some decent submarine kits in that scale."
modelmakers,3489yh,willkinton247,8,Thu Apr 30 05:12:22 2015 UTC,"Thanks for asking.  When i re-started building in about 2001, I decided to restrict myself to World War II era aircraft in 1/72.  I wanted a consistent scale because I have enough OCD to want to, and I wanted my collection to tell a story an allow a visual comparison of the planes.  The WWII stipulation allowed me to 'bookend' the collection and keep the theme manageable. But also I am amazed at just how many aircraft were being pumped out at that time. So many ideas, stories, and each plane a story in itself... whether a freely-thought design from 'basic principles' like the Bf-109, or a very constrained requirement imposed by circumstances like the Boomerang, Short Stirling or He-162.  Some planes that were instantly successful (The A6M Zero), others that took years to get right (Lavochkin La-5/7)... or were never quite right (Me-163, P-39). Or were right, but rejected anyway for other reasons (He-219, Westland Whirlwind).  Aircraft have form and beauty. Of course all machines do to some degree, but aircraft design seems to give full scope for a designer to express his aesthetic sense to create something as unquestionably beautiful as the Spitfire, Mosquito or Mitsubishi Dinah, or as utilitarian and functional as a Wellington, Beaufighter, or, well, anything by Grumman. Others were outright odd.  Markings are endless for aircraft. Just one plane, the P-40, was used in every theatre of war, from remote Pacific islands to the snows outside Moscow, from Alaska to the African desert, from China and India to Hawaii and Iceland.  One could just build P-40s and never run out of unique and distinctive schemes.  Finally, these aircraft all faced the ultimate test in combat. I love tanks, but history shows you could beat a Tiger with five Shermans or T-34s. In air combat, the margin of acceptable inferiority was very slim.  More recently I have compromised the purity of my collection, by making a Korean War Gloster Meteor (still kind of acceptable as the Meteor was a wartime design), but I expect other postwar jets to follow soon.... because they're just so damn cool."

modelmakers,3489yh,garethashenden,3,Thu Apr 30 05:16:15 2015 UTC,"Heller kits are the WORST.  They tend to fit poorly, lack detail in really obvious places, have major inaccuracies (like, not rivet-counter inaccuracies, but somebody anyone vaguely familiar with the subject would notice), have ejection pins and sprue gates at the worst possible spots on the parts, in places where you can't fill and sand easily, um... What else? Their tracks are also terrible. They like to give you things like handrails and grab irons, and then not put locator holes where they're supposed to go, so you're gluing the end of a long thin piece to a flat plane, and they're so poorly sculpted that the end of the long thin piece will be rounded so all you can do is load it with glue and squoosh it on and hope for the best, and then hope you never bump into it because it's going to break off as soon as you breathe too hard near it...   Look at the build parts of my AMX-13 for all the crap I had to do to make it look decent... Check the putty on the turret and the extra bolt heads on the drive sprockets, and so on and so forth... :/  I will not but another Heller kit."

modelmakers,3489yh,HeckleMagpie,1 point,Thu Apr 30 05:00:04 2015 UTC,"I have some other pictures of things like the Friul tracks next to the original tracks (they're even better than you'd think-- the original tracks were pretty rudimentary) and some other stuff. The grab irons on the turret base were originally plastic with no guide holes at all-- just rounded ends glued to flat plastic or to the corner of the antenna mounts. I am pretty sure I mounted the smoke launchers wrong, too, since there weren't really markings there either. You can see the really flat, plain drive sprockets versus the real vehicle's much more interesting parts. And all the hull parts were warped and didn't fit quite right.   They used like half of the hull parts and wheels and stuff for a couple of other AMX 13-based vehicles-- there's a field ambulance and the AMC 13 F3 155mm SPG-- the bottom of the hull was molded in two parts, and each vehicle used the same basic hull sprue plus a sprue with the rest of the hull on it. Except that their molds were super inaccurate-- on the SPG, the kit-specific lower hull was a different width from the shared lower hull part, so it took a lot of sanding to get it right, and then the sides weren't quite right... You can't really tell, though:  http://imgur.com/a/CQBXm  ...but you can see the quality of tracks they shipped, since I didn't buy a second set of Friul tracks for the artillery... And the decals on the SPG were terrible too-- they were printed on a really thick film, made of something really super stiff that even Micro Sol and Micro Set wouldn't touch. I finally had to use thin CA glue and hold them down until it set, especially on the ""TAKROUNA"" on the barrel. Oh, and that barrel is an RB Model metal barrel I got from One Of Those Polish Guys On eBay-- the original was pretty bad and would have required a lot of cleanup too...   I really hope Meng or somebody makes an AMX 13-- Hobby Boss has made kits with the turret at least (one of their Panhard EBR kits has an FL-10 turret) so maybe they'll get around to the actual tank... I'd build another, since I really like the AMX 13, but not if it was a Heller kit."

modelmakers,345row,flounderflound,7,Tue Apr 28 14:59:43 2015 UTC,It seems the advice of my fellow redditors here really paid off. I think you've done a great job on this one. I can recommend the Bf-109 G and any new Airfix spitfire kit. I've built both and they are as good as your Hurricane.
modelmakers,345row,Anonieme_Angsthaas,2,Tue Apr 28 16:14:18 2015 UTC,"I've got 2 Airfix Spits (a Mk IX and a Mk 22) I'm sitting on right now, but I haven't opened the boxes yet to see how the tooling is. I did an Airfix C-47 last year and it was phenomenal. I certainly hope they keep this up.  As for /r/modelmakers, it's amazing the new techniques I've picked up since joining. Seeing other people thrive in areas where you struggle gives a lot of great opportunities to coordinate with them and improve your craft. I freaking love this place."
modelmakers,345row,ionizzatore,4,Tue Apr 28 19:51:48 2015 UTC,"This is Airfix's 1:72 Hurricane, built straight out-of-the-box. Parts fit well, it has recessed panel lines and Cartograf decals. And you magnificent bastards are seriously upping my game. I tried gloss coating before doing decals and they came out the best I've ever done. Not everything's perfect on this one but it was a good opportunity to play around with that technique and now I've seen the results on my own work. Thanks!"
modelmakers,345row,irlrnstuff,3,Tue Apr 28 15:07:47 2015 UTC,Neat!
modelmakers,345row,SnarkMasterRay,2,Tue Apr 28 18:31:37 2015 UTC,I'm building that one and I have to agree its a really good kit. I'm doing the wheels down version which could be a little interesting as you have to thread part of the landing gear through parts A5 on one side and A6 on the other.
modelmakers,345row,murd3rsaurus,2,Tue Apr 28 17:04:23 2015 UTC,I saw that. That should definitely be interesting. Post pics when you're done - I'd love to see it!
modelmakers,347p1x,alaskafish,6,Tue Apr 28 23:25:35 2015 UTC,"What size nozzle are you using? That's most of what controls how thin your line can go. Is the tiniest head .55mm? (That's what I found looking it up...) That's pretty big for doing the kind of detail work you're talking about...   If it's spitting, it could be that the pressure is too low-- low PSI means the paint doesn't atomize, it just sort of puddles up until the drops are big enough that they sort of blat out of the tip. That's especially true with a siphon-feeder, where you need high PSI for it to even start sucking paint up the tube. What PSI are you running? (And depending on your compressor, you may have to set the pressure a little higher than you want to paint at, since it'll drop some when you hit the trigger.)   I think my Badger RK-1 is really great. It comes with .33mm and .2mm nozzles... But it's worth waiting for it to show up on sale..."
modelmakers,347p1x,solipsistnation,3,Tue Apr 28 23:38:06 2015 UTC,"Thanks so much.  Exactly what I was looking.   In fact, it's 53% off on amazon! Maybe I'll go for it.   What's more fine, the .21mm or the .33mm? Seems silly, but it seems like people say that the .21 is a fine needle, but the .33 is ultra fine... what ever that means.  Any gripes about the airbrush."
modelmakers,347p1x,solipsistnation,4,Wed Apr 29 01:46:34 2015 UTC,"I think it may be the angle of the opening, maybe? I mostly use the .33 nozzle and needle anyway.   I sometimes get a bit of tip drying with acrylics. And once I dropped a tip and it fell down the sink and I had to order a new one-- they're very very tiny and they're not cheap. (Like $20 for a new needle/tip set.) Those are the only problems I've had with it.   It's not great for doing base coats, because it's so fine. You have to do a lot of passes... But that means I don't lay on too much paint, which tends to be my biggest problem. Really, though, it's a fantastic airbrush."
modelmakers,347p1x,solipsistnation,2,Wed Apr 29 03:43:15 2015 UTC,"Well, maybe if I was to get this one, I could still use my current for base coats, and primer. Anything that requires lots of paint output.   Do you really recommend it? Is it the go to airbrush for modelers, or is it just what you personally use?"
modelmakers,347p1x,solipsistnation,1 point,Wed Apr 29 11:08:51 2015 UTC,"Have you read all the airbrush threads on here? There IS no one airbrush for modelers... 8) I've seen people use everything from $15 Chinese cheapie Master Airbrushes to somebody who got one of those $400 super high-end things. Mostly people hang out in the $70-$100 range (Badger Patriot 105s or similar).   I like the RK-1 and I think it has a fine enough tip and good control for painting details on 1/72 scale kits-- it's a personal recommendation. I do still have my old one for base coats, primer, and Future, but when I want to do any shading or stuff like that, it's the RK-1."

modelmakers,347p1x,Duke_of_Fritzburg,3,Wed Apr 29 19:33:39 2015 UTC,"My VL sputtered a lot too, and shot pretty wide as well.  The problem is an air leak around the air cap (not the crown, the bit between the crown and the body).  The threads are leaking air.  Use either an airbrush lubricant or piping thread tape to seal it up.    As for the wide bit, the VL excels best at spraying medium bodied paint in large areas.  A higher-end Badger or an Iwata Eclipse would probably be better suited.  I've ran both, and I'll say despite the price tag, I prefer the Iwata."

modelmakers,348egq,KaeenDeathwalker,1 point,Thu Apr 30 10:29:52 2015 UTC,Try an airbrush mainly made for scale models like Tamiya or Gunze Sangyo. Getting it outside of the US can prove to be hard though. I have a Tamiya Spray Work HG III. It says on the Tamiya Website that it can spray fine lines less than 1mm thick. http://www.tamiya.com/english/products/74532airbrush3/index.htm
modelmakers,3452rr,ionizzatore,2,Tue Apr 28 10:57:57 2015 UTC,"I think it's an interesting kit, although a subject matter that has been done very well in 1/72 by both Fujimi and Hasegawa. Hasegawa's is known for being fiddly, but very accurate. I don't hear much bad about Fujimi's F-14, and it's reportedly a much easier build than the Hasegawa offering, but it can be hard to find in the US.  It is odd that the flaps/slats are fixed, especially considering that Has/Fujimi included it in the 20+-year-old releases, and Hobby Boss does not in their recent release.  The weapons seem really pricey, but you'd need to buy at least two of the Hasegawa sets to get a LANTIRN in set VII (X72-12) and the Phoenix in set III (X72-3). Three sets if you really want to get the later -9M and -7M Sidewinders and Sparrows in set V (X72-9). I believe the visual differences are fairly minimal compared to the -9L and -7E found in set III with the Phoenix, although, these are older, one-piece moldings.  Better weapons options certainly exist with Eduard's Brassin 1/72 -9L/M, -7M, and -154 A or C.   I don't believe that any other Bombcat loadout items are included with the Fine Molds releases, so doing one will require bombs and adapters from the Hasegawa weapons set VI (X72-011).  It's still pricey, but at least using Fine Molds weapons set you can avoid buying several weapons sets to get the full loadout and get away with buying only one Hasegawa set if you want to add a bomb load.  I would have liked to have seen a second marking option along with the chosen one, although some of the colorful later OIF/OEF/Last Cruises birds would have almost required the Bombcat parts.  Also, don't forget that FineMolds just released a 1/72 seat belt set for the NACES seats: http://www.hlj.com/product/FNMNA-07/Air  There are a few threads about the kit around. Here on Reddit a few weeks back: http://www.reddit.com/r/modelmakers/comments/30tfja/newtool_172_scale_f14d_tomcat_from_fine/  One on ARC: http://www.arcforums.com/forums/air/index.php?showtopic=283330  One on Britmodeller: http://www.britmodeller.com/forums/index.php?/topic/234979054-172-grumman-f-14d-tomcat-by-fine-molds-model-graphix/"

It's indeed odd. But i must say that i thought about it, and unless you are displaying a ""moving"" Tomcat (takeoff/landing) flaps and slats are only an additional part that needs to be glued together. At this point i'm more curious about the possibility to put the wings in ""parking position"" (with the wings sighly overlapping the tail, i remember that the A variant had this possibility, and iirc it was not removed in the later versions)   The weapons seem really pricey, but you'd need to buy at least two of the Hasegawa sets to get a LANTIRN in set VII [...]   I admit that i tought about my ""spare weaponry stash"" (weapons from kits, weapon sets...) and i did not realized that each hasegawa set is dedicated only to a type of weapon so...

Also, don't forget that FineMolds just released a 1/72 seat belt set for the NACES seats: http://www.hlj.com/product/FNMNA-07/Air   The detail is amazing! The only problem is that those belts cost as much as a resin set of seats   There are a few threads about the kit around [...]   I remember those threads, but this page contains the breakdown of the ""sprue/issue distribution"" and some more detail on the decals    In the end (imho): the tomcat itself is valid and reasonably priced even with the weapons, but it needs a decal sheet."

But generally speaking, it's difficult. Germany basically consists of many Germanic tribes and is more a cultural nation than a strict ""ethnic"" nation. For example people from northern Germany are statistically bigger than people from southern Germany. Also there are more blondes in northern Germany. So there are statistical differences. But all in all you could mistaken a French for a German if you're looking just for ""distinct German"" features and this French happen to have them."

Granted, these things define a lot of central Europe, but when you look at the history, everything between Poland and France, but north of Italy will have similar characteristics, as the borders are really pretty new.  Germans, Dutch, etc.  Really similar.  But you can tell a German from a Pole pretty easily.  The nose shape is different(usually bigger), the shape of the eyebrows is different.  And Germans are typically fairer skinned than a lot of the surrounding areas."
modelmakers,343a68,mpleonid,1 point,Tue Apr 28 02:58:22 2015 UTC,Nope and that is because there really is not that much of a difference. You surely could not tell of asians that are not separated by enormous distance...

Put a small blob of silly putty in each window section and use a round toothpick to push it about to mask the pane.  Trim the sharp end off of the toothplck so you have a blunt end on it.  After you have the pane covered let it sit for a little while as the putty will self level and form a tight seal against the frames.  Spray with light coats and let dry.  Gently dislodge the putty with a sharp toothpick.  any small bits can be removed by pressing a ball of putty against it and pulling sharply away

modelmakers,343fyp,jebleez,2,Tue Apr 28 04:34:09 2015 UTC,"Spraypaint is like a shotgun when you want a sniper rifle.  It comes out too fast and isn't really suited for the job.  I have become pretty good at using it over the years but I still make mistakes sometimes.  You have to mist it on.  NEVER try to cover it in one coat, just don't.  You probably need to move the model several inches further away and mist it on a little at a time.  You also need to keep the can actively moving, never slow down. If you do this, you can keep from ruining the paint job. I recommend that you buy some cheap spray paint and practice on some junk until you get the hang of it."
modelmakers,343fyp,HughJorgens,2,Tue Apr 28 22:48:23 2015 UTC,"I've had this happen a few times.

Spray in short spurts (A sec or two)..and also move the can at all times. You almost want to be misting the model.  Also shake the shit out of the can. You think you shook alot? Shake for a minute more.
modelmakers,341vwc,heinencm,4,Mon Apr 27 17:32:48 2015 UTC,"Now, keep in mind I've not done this because of the mess it generates, but the guys in my IPMS chapter have used blue insulating foam boards.  One can cut out layers like a topographical map and then sandwich it together with white or wood glue, then use sandpaper to blend the layers together.  Once that's done, a shell of papier mache can be applied."
modelmakers,341vwc,screamingcheese,3,Mon Apr 27 18:27:19 2015 UTC,I think this would be a pretty cool technique.  It would be fun to replicate from an actual topographical map a real location or battlefield.

modelmakers,341vwc,Destructias_Warlord,2,Tue Apr 28 15:34:45 2015 UTC,"Styrofoam for the general layout / bulk since it's easy to cut, and the hot wire cutters aren't that expensive. Depending on what level of detail you need I would use PVC foam (like what's in the center of foam core boards) in different thicknesses. PVC-foam is a rather common sign making supply (art stores sometimes have it as well but at a hefty markup) and it can be spray painted without melting.   Make sure the glue you use works with the type of foam you will be using. White/Carpenters glue needs contact with air to dry and some other have solvents that happily eats away any expanded polystyrene that stands in it's way!"

modelmakers,341vwc,HillbillyInHouston,2,Tue Apr 28 22:35:30 2015 UTC,"You can always use newspaper and flour/water and do paper mache.  Just wad up the paper into the rough shape you want and cover it with strips of paper soaked in flour and water.  Keep it thin, that is the secret, so it can dry. You can always go back later to add more.  It isn't super strong unless you add multiple layer though."
modelmakers,341vwc,HughJorgens,2,Tue Apr 28 22:54:00 2015 UTC,"Best thing to use is foam installation board the pink some times blue variety. You can pick up a big sheet from home depot/ Lowe's for like 10 bucks. Then you'll want to ferry a hot wire catching tool, most  hobby stores such as hobby lobby, Michael's etc should carry them. They run  about 15 bucks.   The material can be glued with white glue to build up layers. Then carve, sand our shape it however you like."

If you get a little too much on the edge of the canopy, you have plenty of time to just wipe it off with paper towel before it dries.  Also, it's best to test fit the canopy before you glue it down. Test-fit it and sand any areas necessary to get a good fit. Just use a little bit of glue on the end of a toothpick, you don't need to glue the entire edge of the canopy, just a couple spots, it's not going anywhere and there's less chance of making a mess."

modelmakers,341euy,irlrnstuff,5,Mon Apr 27 17:02:51 2015 UTC,I use plain old PVA glue. Seems to do the trick as long as you don't drop kick the model across the room and dries clear.

If the canopy sucks, start with careful carving and shaping of the canopy/fuselage joint. Then apply normal liquid cement to both surfaces. Now cut a strip of masking tape. Good, full-tack paper tape. Touch the middle of the tape onto the top of the canopy, then take the ends in your fingertips and clamp the canopy down, sticking the tape to the fuselage. Check it's fitted properly. Walk away."
modelmakers,341euy,Flabergie,2,Tue Apr 28 05:02:12 2015 UTC,I use Future to attach canopies.  Put a coat of Future on the fuselage mating edge and position your canopy.  Don''t worry about perfect coverage.  Let dry for 15 minutes then fill any gaps by applying Future to the seam with a small brush.  Repeat as necessary.

You can also take a large paint brush and brush on thinner before you mist on the adhesive but it isn't necessary.
modelmakers,340ro6,timosaurus-rex,4,Mon Apr 27 11:58:13 2015 UTC,"The Cavalier this resin sets work great, they just cost a bit.  they are easy to work with and really quick.  Just trim them up and attach with a slow CA glue.  I've done putty a few times, and it works really well, you just have to take your time.  Tamiya sells a set of saw blades just for creating Zimmerit surfaces: Zimmerit blades  These work really well if you are patient.  The trick is to get an even layer of putty on the surface of the model first, then wipe the blade off after every pass.  I've heard Tamiya's polyester putty recommended, but I liked Squadron white putty.  The toluene (extremely toxic) in the putty will eat into the plastic a bit and really hold it on.  The finish is not 100% precise, which is fine since it was sometimes applied in the field, and it also chipped, cracked, and weathered as well.  It's a long process, but what's the rush?  I do not recommend heating/melting anything plastic; I've seen it done, but it's way to imprecise.  Besides, if you wreck it, you'll be correcting it with putty anyway!"
modelmakers,340ro6,tankbuster183,3,Mon Apr 27 13:01:50 2015 UTC,"Here's a good link with a high level review of all the methods and details on how to apply them, http://ilovewood001.tripod.com/modeling/zimmerit.html  From what I've seen using the putty method is the best option. It's the most realistic and gives you more room for error. Don't like a pattern? Scrape or sand off the putty. If you don't like how it looks and you melted it into the plastic then fixing it is gonna be way more headache inducing. Another good thing about putty is that you can use any number of flat edged tools from aforementioned screwdriver to a piece of styrene. With styrene you can even cut it to the right width (and get a piece with the right thickness) for the scale of the kit you're working."
modelmakers,340ro6,Falldog,3,Mon Apr 27 13:04:05 2015 UTC,"Honestly I self applied my Zimmerit to my tamiya tiger 2. Just go section my section applying putty in individual batches, try to aim for 1 inch x 1 inch sections to avoid the putty drying before being able to imprint it with a screwdriver or Zimmerit tool. In the end I was very pleased with the result. Best of all my solution was cheap"

I'll share pics when/if I'm satisfied with the results.  Your first attempt looks great. I'll reiterate that you may want to thin your paint out...although ill attest to how tough it was to get the yellow nose painted without having the grey plastic base showing through. Must've took me at least 4 coats over several days.
modelmakers,33zrhn,Brickie78,2,Mon Apr 27 06:23:36 2015 UTC,Sweet! Id love to see your 2 Bf109s!  Yeah Ill definitely have to thin the paint.
modelmakers,33zrhn,ionizzatore,3,Mon Apr 27 06:31:53 2015 UTC,"Pretty damn good I'd say. Consider using masking tape to get straight lines on your cockpit canopy - this was the absolute revelation for me when I discovered it after spending my childhood doing it with a thin brush, a not-too-steady hand and a tongue slightly sticking out of one corner of my mouth."
modelmakers,33zrhn,RowanStewart,3,Mon Apr 27 09:03:49 2015 UTC,"The washes are a bit too heavy. This, combined with the glossy finish, give a ""greasy"" look to the aircraft.  A layer of dullcote (protect the canopy before this operation!) will remove part of the greasy look.  For the washes, try to use them only on panel lines (after a gloss coat, if possible) and apply oil leaks and stains only after the panel line wash. A general wash (not only along panel lines but on the whole surface) is useful when you need to apply washes over an object such as an engine.  Regarding the exhausts, exhaust stains have a more ""complex"" color than just black. Usually some gray simulates the paint heated and ""cooked"" by the hot gases, then some black+brown (more black toward the center of the stain, more brown toward the outer margin) simulates the carbon deposits. Don't worry about this for now, but keep it mind for when you will use an airbrush (example: https://imgur.com/a/LqhSu)  Anyway, nice start! Keep it up! (:"

Just finished this one myself after a long break from modeling. except have to order a new canopy because my son lost the original.  I used a little artistic licensing on the paint job, but it's pretty typical for the time.  Some good advice here. As /u/84mg09 said thin the paint even brushing you can get a decent finish. There's lots of videos on YouTube.  As also mentioned the wash should be subtle. Apply a gloss coat then, wash with oil paints and mineral spirits wipe most of it off with a qtip. Look as real life aircraft pictures online get an idea for the airflow and where oil and dirt runs. Lastly apply a dull cote to tone it all down.  But every model you make is a learning experience. Myself I went a little crazy with the paint chipping. I think I'm going to build another try it again.  /u/-imyourhuckleberry- I would also be interested in seeing your diorama when done.

modelmakers,33xthi,GentlemanMetalhead,6,Sun Apr 26 17:51:06 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah, you're going to have some trouble painting that, especially if the skirts and stuff are already glued on... This one may be a learning experience build. Many (or most) kits have some kind of trick like that-- you have to think about how you'll paint things like the wheels and behind the wheels and not glue everything on in the order the instructions say. Unfortunately that's something you have to learn the hard way, I think. I have a Panzer II ausf L Luchs with some terrible-looking wheels because I didn't think about how to get the overlapping road wheels painted...   What I would have done is left the wheels and skirts off and painted them separately, then painted the hull and turret and attached the painted pieces to the painted hull (which might mean careful paint scraping or might mean careful masking depending on how they attach). I usually do the tracks separately and attach them late on in the build too. I'm most of the way through a Panzer II build log where I talk about that sort of thing here:  http://www.reddit.com/r/modelmakers/wiki/buildalongs  Your tank looks pretty good in general, though-- you've got a couple of sprue attachment points you could trim, but overall it's not bad. It's going to be a pain to paint (unless you can carefully remove the skirts and stuff) and you may end up repainting the detail stuff you already painted, but if you take your time you should be able to get it looking pretty good.

So why not glue them on the model right now! And then glue the upper hull to the lower hull.  ...then it hit me: how was I supposed to paint the road wheels, tracks and the tiny details?"

Just over 50 in some places, art stores with a student discount of 10%, or a regular coupon of 40% might also do the trick for an in store purchase, e.g. at Dick Blick's art supplies, assuming you're US based."

Archer's decals, Mig Effects or Eduard's addons or any other fancy stuff? It's online shop only. And the delivery vary widely accross online shops. If you are lucky you will get a good forwarder and no problem during port check.  Speaking of which, you may ask me, why not open our own shop? This is clearly an opportunity right? Well, in 2009 there were about 9-10 hobby shops in Jakarta. Now there is only 4-5. And they are also not doing very well (incomplete stocks, paints etc). The one doing very well have prices double that of US price, but are located in a wealthy shopping area. Most hobby shops here changed their orientation towards Gunpla."

The traditional method of pouring directly is simply too barbaric. I wasted a considreable amount of quality lacquer thinners that way.  A method I love to use, and now already my habit is this:   Get the straw pipettes and the thinner bottle and bring them close like in the above picture.  The key is to touch the lip of the bottle with the pipette, and then slowly tilting the bottle so only a few drops come out. The drops that come out will touch the straw and will drip along it towards the bowl.   I have used this method for years. However I never see this being used by any other fellow airbrush enthusiast. -"

I'm really surprised how the weathering on the tracks is turning out, especially for my first attempt! It's looking much better than I was expecting.

I then applied a thinned out layer of Humbrol Matt Cote to the tracks and started applying weathering powders. If anyone has any tips, let me know!"

There are more of them out there and the quality has gone up a lot-- there are better injection molding machines and computer-aided manufacturing technology means we can make better, more detailed molds for parts and stuff.

modelmakers,33vchh,solipsistnation,2,Sun Apr 26 14:28:22 2015 UTC,I went ahead and ordered the airbrush kit :)
modelmakers,33vchh,Dr_Von_Spaceman,3,Sun Apr 26 20:34:43 2015 UTC,"Eh, economies of scale (...so to speak) is probably a part of it. I suspect there is less volume sold today than even 20 years ago. That said, I think a lot of it is just inflation. Figure that in the last 25 years, $1 went up to ~$1.80. In that light, modern kit prices aren't that much different than they were then. Older kits (the classic Monogram 1/48 fighters) can be had at Michaels for like $15 which is pretty darn good. Even their new kits aren't badly priced.  I know what you mean though. I'm turning into my dad when I balk at ""prices that aren't what they were in my day."""
modelmakers,33vchh,SnarkMasterRay,3,Sun Apr 26 00:59:44 2015 UTC,"Hey, I may have bumped elbows with you on Saturday :)  Have you looked into the regular IPMS Seattle meetings?  As far as the expense, there a variety of reasons. Production costs are up - even with the advances in CAD, the tooling costs for the molds are really high. Demand is down, so they have to raise prices to recoup more of that cost per unit sold. Shipping is expensive, even if you use an asian site to buy from, it's often not all that much cheaper than what you can get here once shipping is added.  With regards to the hobby shop you dropped coin at.... Galaxy or Skyway? Both are worth going to if you  haven't been to either."
modelmakers,33vchh,SnarkMasterRay,1 point,Mon Apr 27 15:12:25 2015 UTC,"Yeah, was considering attending the next IPMS mtg.  What typically goes on at those?  I dropped most of the coin at Galaxy.  Nice place, like it much better than Hobby Town in Redmond.  Haven't been to the other one yet."
modelmakers,33vchh,SnarkMasterRay,2,Mon Apr 27 21:37:12 2015 UTC,"Meetings are generally open for the first hour or so... there's 3-4 tables that people bring works in projects or completed things to show off and either talk around those or at the other tables. Some of us bring kits to do light construction on (no airbrushing or rattle can painting, but detail work is OK, glue is OK, sanding is OK). After an hour or so of this and it's felt that all of the models that are going to show up have, the ""official"" meeting starts, which is 5-10 minutes of news and then people getting up and officially talking about their stuff on the tables, if they want to. There's usually one or two people setting kits, either thinning out their stash or Emil from Skyway Models shows up with the new hotness. It's a pretty loose and relaxed atmosphere.   If you can only do one per year I'd hit the December meeting because EVERYONE shows up for that and the sugar foods that people bring. June-August usually have smaller turn outs, but even that is maybe 40-50 people.   Occasionally there's a presentation or ""how to"" but most of the time it's hang out and talk models. I'm going to miss May's as I'll be coming back from a research trip, but I can suggest a couple names to check in with via PM if you're interested."

modelmakers,33vchh,irlrnstuff,1 point,Mon Apr 27 23:33:19 2015 UTC,"December meeting is closer to 100. This is actually a very good region for plastic model builders. There's another group that meets the first Thursday of each month at the Museum of Flight in the evening (admission is free that day after 4PM or so and they stay open late). That one's harder for me to get to so I'm not as familiar with it, but the IPMS Seattle group has a lot of variety - lots of airplanes but also ships, armor, cars, sci-fi, etc. You saw that in the show :)"
modelmakers,33va5z,alaskafish,2,Sat Apr 25 23:34:07 2015 UTC,"I want to paint a Tiger tank, and this stuff caught my eye.  I like the effect, but I also don't like it. It's mixed to be honest. Most of the time it looks like a winter vehicle. I've also heard it does not look realistic at all.  I'm trying to get a good color blended AFV. Yet, something that doesn't look like it's caked in makeup. What do the skilled pros use?"
modelmakers,33va5z,XenophonTheAthenian,2,Sat Apr 25 23:36:16 2015 UTC,"If done properly you should barely be able to tell that the effect has been used. That example has been rather heavily weathered, but even though it'll look stark at first it's not that hard to blend it--I've found that oils in particular are fantastic for blending modulation. The images that Vallejo and Mig show on their sets are before any blending and weathering, so they look very stark. About the winter vehicle stuff, I've found that Vallejo and Mig's sets usually are very very grey and cold, which is why they look like that--mixing your own colors could give you a very nice color. The example I linked to used Tamiya Field Blue, Medium Blue, and Light Blue, and I've played around with the same mix and found that oils can blend those perfectly. They also don't look quite as stark as shades of grey.   About the realism of color modulation, it's important to note that it's not really supposed to look realistic. If properly blended it's supposed to emphasis the different shades of panels as light hits them--the lack of photorealism comes from the fact that color modulation imagines several different light sources, so that at whatever angle you look at the vehicle you see the effect."
modelmakers,33va5z,XenophonTheAthenian,1 point,Sun Apr 26 02:04:18 2015 UTC,I bought the item.  I'm going to give it a shot. Worst case scenario I learn that I don't like them and never buy them.
modelmakers,33va5z,tankbuster183,1 point,Sun Apr 26 02:31:50 2015 UTC,"I'd recommend using a relatively heavy filter, probably a couple different filter colors actually, and a decent amount of streaking. That should blend stuff in relatively well--doing an oil dot filter will make it even better"

It probably sounds stupid, but I was unhappy with painting gray for years until I did this, and now I really like it.  It's always easier to tone down than make lighter.  BTW, I love the bird poop effect.  All the tanks I've built, I never thought of this."
modelmakers,33va5z,Anonieme_Angsthaas,1 point,Mon Apr 27 15:26:36 2015 UTC,"I also really like bluish Panzer Greys. For one thing, blue changes the perceived depth of the color, it makes the grey look darker than it actually is. And it's very very subtle"
modelmakers,33va5z,solipsistnation,4,Mon Apr 27 16:38:33 2015 UTC,"A lot of modeling products like this are ""all in one box"" versions of things that you can do yourself.  In this case, you can always mix the paint yourself, but if you don't mind spending the money buying these sets can be an easier way of getting the same thing.  One thing to remember with modulation is that the weathering you apply afterwards will (well, should) tone down the stark contrast a bit."

modelmakers,33vmum,Shadowpants,2,Sun Apr 26 01:40:18 2015 UTC,You could try it but I've found tamiya rattle cans are the best for large surfaces since I don't have an airbrush
modelmakers,33vmum,z71patt,1 point,Sun Apr 26 05:08:30 2015 UTC,"If the model has only one ""base color"" (monotonous gray plastic, no putty applied, no PE, no tan resin parts...) you can skip the primer and apply the paint directly.  But first you will have to test the paint somewhere else (sprues or the inside of the model) to be sure that it will attach to the model without melting the plastic or flaking when you touch the dried paint. If this test fails, you may want to apply primer on the model and then paint it"
modelmakers,33vmum,ionizzatore,1 point,Sun Apr 26 19:37:54 2015 UTC,"Primer tends to be pretty rough, since it's supposed to be there for paint to attach to. You could probably prime in which or gray and just use that, but it might not look very good. And even Tamiya's white primer seems like it's a little off-white. That may be fine for that model, but you'll have to look at it and decide for yourself."
modelmakers,33ti8t,darkrift5,5,Sat Apr 25 14:00:15 2015 UTC,"This is Aluminum metalizer over Testors light primer, I used primer to smooth out the putty lines. I've used metalizer before with the same primer and everything and it worked fine, but now it cracked and the whole model looks like this for the most part. I gave the primer 6 days to dry, so that's not the problem. I also used light coats from the rattle can for the metalizer.  Again, even on the same model (doors and such that had to be painted the same way) it never did this."
modelmakers,33ti8t,spinney,6,Sat Apr 25 14:04:11 2015 UTC,Looks like a humidity problem to me. Soak it in paint thinner and scrub off the paint.
modelmakers,33ti8t,Sashoke,9,Sat Apr 25 14:49:40 2015 UTC,Might have to wash all the paint off and start from the top.
modelmakers,33ti8t,windupmonkeys,5,Sat Apr 25 14:35:57 2015 UTC,"Strip and remove. That kind of cracking is pretty incurable, or it's just easier to redo it."
modelmakers,33ti8t,SnarkMasterRay,3,Sat Apr 25 19:47:16 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the help, I tried stripping it and while the paint comes off it looks like it dug into the plastic and reacted or something, it's almost like it's carved into the surface.  Guess there goes $50..."
modelmakers,33ti8t,SnarkMasterRay,1 point,Sun Apr 26 16:27:22 2015 UTC,"Looks like a Monogram 1/48 B-29? My guess is that the primer etched the surface when it hit, which isn't all that uncommon for some of the more ""hot"" primers with good grip. It's not a loss at all, it just depends on how much work you want to put into it.   If you use the raised panel lines as a template or guide, you can re-cut scribed panel lines into the wing and then that will give you more freedom to re-work the surface to sand and smooth any pitting or roughness from the primer.  Some people do this anyway as the scribed lines are more accurate to what the actual planes had. It's more work, but honestly not that bad once you get a system down."
modelmakers,33ti8t,pigmanAFM,2,Mon Apr 27 15:33:36 2015 UTC,"Yep, Monogram b29. I'm going to strip the paint and lightly sand it. I'll try new primer and I'm using this to justify an airbrush purchase for some quality primer and Alclad"
modelmakers,33ti8t,SnarkMasterRay,1 point,Mon Apr 27 18:47:46 2015 UTC,"Alclad is great stuff. I've found it very easy to apply if you can do even coats. Of course, you have to fix ever.... single..... surface.... flaw.... or it will highlight it.  I'm not sure what you're using for sanding, but I use the product from MicroMesh which has some insanely high grits. I would consider the lower values at least a must for any natural metal job."
modelmakers,33ti8t,pigmanAFM,2,Mon Apr 27 19:49:05 2015 UTC,It happened because you used enamel on top of enamel.
modelmakers,33ti8t,SnarkMasterRay,1 point,Sun Apr 26 09:30:20 2015 UTC,What? You can use enamel on enamel - I do it all the time. When people paint on multiple coats they're doing the same thing.
modelmakers,33uyhv,flounderflound,2,Sat Apr 25 21:45:24 2015 UTC,"I've used both.  Honestly, I don't care for Model Master Acryl gloss clear.  For my dollar, Future floor wax is a much more effective acrylic clear gloss, and it's ridiculously cheap.    As for the lacquer, I use it for automotive clearcoats, and I've used it over gloss white in some pretty thick layers without any significant yellowing.  I've actually seen worse yellowing with the flat clear lacquer, and both are prone to fogging if you try to get REALLY aggressive with adding tons of coats without letting the prior coats cure properly.    If my model is going to stay glossy (ie., a show/race aircraft or car) I use lacquer, because it's tougher, can be polished easier, and ages better.  Enamel and acrylic clear seems to get dull after a couple of years.    If my model is just getting gloss for weathering and decalling, I usually go with Future, because of the low odor and how well it holds up against oil-based weathering techniques."

If you ever decide to add a small little base you could copy the King Tiger diorama base thats displayed in the r/modelmakers masthead up there. It wasn't what he was going for but he accidently made the most realistic Tunisa/North African groundwork I've ever seen. I'm just seeing that but with your 131 weathered out with a commander and grenadier sprinting in cover along the side. I actually know very little about 131 besides it was one of S.Pz.Abt.502s I think. But yeah, for a wartime depiction I'd recommend a little base, a commander poking his head out and one or a few of dragon's grenadiers but I'd have to research to figure out which. :) It's a gorgeous build man, jokes aside It's prestine as-is."

modelmakers,33pkme,tankbuster183,8,Fri Apr 24 13:38:50 2015 UTC,"This monstrosity Neubaufahrzeug was built in 1934 and mainly used as a propaganda tool, though they saw some combat in Norway.  The Germans figured out early on that multi-turreted tanks were not going to work.  This is the Dragon kit built out of the box; it's decent, some oversimplifications.  The Amusing Hobby kit is suposed to be better.  I was really excited to build this when it came out, only to find I really dislike the actual tank and was glad to be done with it.  I wanted to show how plain old Panzer Gray (Grey) can still be somewhat interesting.  I based it with Tamiya Panzer Gray with a little dark blue added, then did an over coat with a little lighter gray.  Brown camo was either Tamiya brown or their Nato brown (I already forgot).  Tons of filters on here, all Humbrol: brick red, orange, light tan.  These were done over a period of about a month, to slowly build them up. Also some raw umber, yellow ochre local applications for interesting grime, in addition to AK interactive washes the same way.  Most of the weathering on here is negated my my camera/phone/lighting, but the point is less is always more.  Try a weathering step, let it sit overnight, come back, add more.  Breathe.  It's not a race; you don't have to finish a kit in a week!"
modelmakers,33pkme,solipsistnation,6,Fri Apr 24 13:38:55 2015 UTC,I like that it's big enough to have just straight-up Panzer II turrets stuck all over it.  Edit: I mean Panzer I.
modelmakers,33pkme,platapus112,3,Fri Apr 24 14:12:48 2015 UTC,"I always liked the Soviet T-28/T-35 tanks, but I really didn't enjoy this build as much as I thought I would, so I may skip the Russkies."
modelmakers,33pkme,solipsistnation,3,Fri Apr 24 15:27:58 2015 UTC,Have you seen the SMK? KV3 hull with a long necked kv1 turret and 2 t-26 turrets on it
modelmakers,33pkme,solipsistnation,3,Fri Apr 24 17:41:02 2015 UTC,"I did, it looks ridiculous too. I'm not too big on the prototype stuff; I'm a pretty big history nut, so I kind of stray away from the 'paper panzers' like the VK series and the unbuilt KVs.  There's enough tanks that saw action that I can build for years without having to do the proposed ones.  Trumpter makes a lot of the German unbuilt ones."
modelmakers,33pkme,ChrisQF,2,Fri Apr 24 19:42:44 2015 UTC,"Why not? Just the number of turrets or the kit itself or just not as interested in that vehicle as you thought you would be?  I'm not accusing you of being a tank slacker or anything, I'm just curious. 8)"
modelmakers,33pkme,ChrisQF,2,Fri Apr 24 16:39:00 2015 UTC,"I just wasn't as interested in it as I thought I'd be.  This always happens: all I build is tanks, and I'll have a kit that's been on the shelf for years, I feel bad, and start building it and end up having a blast.  I've been building long enough that I usually have several kits going at a time so I can either build, paint, or weather on any given session.  There seems to be quite a few 'tread heads' on here lately, I've really been enjoying this sub."
modelmakers,33pkme,ChrisQF,2,Fri Apr 24 17:09:00 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'm always happy to talk tanks. 8)  I haven't had a chance to do much building, but I definitely know what you mean about not being as interested as you think you will be-- I've been working on like 4 kits, with another I got partly built and just stuck back in the box. (An M22 Locust-- I wanted to like it a lot more than I actually did. I'll get back to it sooner or later, anyway.)"
modelmakers,33pkme,jalien,5,Fri Apr 24 18:47:43 2015 UTC,How do you make the exhaust so rusty?
modelmakers,33pkme,Fradra,4,Fri Apr 24 14:21:41 2015 UTC,"I used a product I've had for about 12 years called Cast-a-Coat.  Unfortunately I think it's off the market.  You can probably replicate it though, I would think white glue, or thinned white glue brushed onto the muffler, then while wet, sprinkle a superfine grit abrasive on.  It has to be really fine, like baking soda/beach sand, almost like powder.  Let it dry, add or sand off where needed.  All my rust painting is Lifecolor's ""Dust & Rust"" set, which is really just rust brown/dark orange/light orange/yellow.  they can be stippled over each other to build up the effect.  The metallic grit is good old no 2 pencil."

modelmakers,33pblx,pytagoras,6,Fri Apr 24 12:06:09 2015 UTC,"Time to show off my latest build and this is the Panther Ausf. F. from Dragon, kit number 6403.  Primed and painted with Vallejo model air colors, mostly from the Vallejo Panzer Colors set #71177. Wash and pigments also from Vallejo. Tracks are primed with Vallejo and painted with the AK Interactive Track Primer (like that color).  Not much weathering besides an overall dark grey filter and some brown filter/wash to the lower parts of the hull.  No after market parts besides the usual metal tracks, although this time I used a set of Spade Ace tracks (#35005) that I had in my stash. They're not the proper tracks for this late version Panther, but I did not want to buy yet another set when I could just use these and most people wouldn't notice anyway.  Build time approx. 3 months.  Feel free to leave a comment and ask questions."
modelmakers,33pblx,solipsistnation,3,Fri Apr 24 12:13:44 2015 UTC,That's a nice clean build-- I don't think anyone could give you a hard time about not weathering it much... It's a nice-looking tank.
modelmakers,33pblx,Deepseat,4,Fri Apr 24 18:49:59 2015 UTC,"You have very specific finish to all your builds. It's interesting that different builders can do the same kit, use the same materials and paint etc and end up with totally different depictions.  I've found this is really the case with armor and diorama builders and I think it's one of the reasons I enjoy looking at them so much. It's so cool to see these things come to life and imagine how awesome theyd look in different battles and landscapes and weather. Yours  all feel very clean and have a very strong museum type quality to them, even the ones that are weathered still have a quality I can't quite put my finger on."

You can replicate it by painting the appropriate parts in aluminum, then spraying over that with a 50:50 mixture of clear blue and clear green paints. Or, you can just find an Aotake color that comes pre-mixed looking the way it should. Mine is from Gunze-Sangyo.  Check your references, the Japanese used that color on a variety of interior surfaces, sometimes in cockpits as well. It varied widely in exact shades as well, so don't get too caught up trying to be 100% accurate."

modelmakers,33m2i2,MMGeoff,3,Thu Apr 23 19:38:54 2015 UTC,"I liked how he talked a bit about the painting style, how they deliberately exaggerate certain colors and shades because of how the model will look on film under all the lighting and later processing, etc. When the camera zoomed up really close on the Y-wing I was taken aback because the painting is really loose and sloppy on certain parts - but standing back four or five feet the whole thing holds together and looks extremely ""realistic."" There's no canopy glass, either. That would probably produce a big glare under the studio lighting and give it away that you're actually looking at a model, not a ""real"" Y-Wing.  Models meant for display or competition are approached with a totally different philosophy.  It's also super cool how these are all kitbashes from existing models.

If that's what you're looking at, word of warning - the upper fuselage area around the cockpit is a separate piece, so the molds could be shared between the variants.  The instructions would have you install these after bringing the two halves of the fuselage together.  Instead, attach them to the two fuselage halves first, before anything else, so that you can get the seams on the fuselage sides flush.  It's much easier to fix the seam running the length of the fuselage than it is along the side of it."

Priming a 1/48th kit with such a fine airbrush is frustrating and acrylic primer is monotonous. Something like the Iwata hp-be2. Yes, I'm a tool nut, so sue me."

modelmakers,33lrc7,alaskafish,-2,Thu Apr 23 23:05:24 2015 UTC,"Actually... why get Acrylic thinners?  Just use water. Acrylic paints are water based. The thinners, in my opinion, are just wastes of money."
modelmakers,33lrc7,HandBanaba,3,Thu Apr 23 19:29:31 2015 UTC,"Because most thinners like humbrol and Vallejo, etc have drying retardants to help with airbrush flow and to help when going for a very smooth brush painted coat. You can do fine with water in some paints but it's far from ideal. Not to mention some tap water can have adverse reactions with some paints and cause peeling, cracking and change the color as well.   There are plenty of reasons to use thinners, many more than there are for using water, tap or distilled."
modelmakers,33lrc7,MadMorf,1 point,Thu Apr 23 20:19:09 2015 UTC,"I'm with you. Water works just fine to thin acrylics for airbrush use. Solvent based thinners tend to dry faster, unless they have some kind of retarder added, but water doesn't dry all that fast, with nothing else added."

As far as I'm aware, the US army didn't install their version of the 105 on M47s. Also, the M48 hull is more egg-shaped, whereas the M46/47 closely resemble the flatter one of the M26."

I've been wanting to build a big castle for my nephew to play with for awhile, but haven't had a ton of time, though I'm about to start it back up so that I can hopefully finish in time by Christmas or his birthday in January.  I actually just opted to form the basic underlying structure from cardboard, popsicle sticks, and other similar items, then I use a thin layer of Das Clay on top of that, followed by a thin facade of flat stones (also made with Das Clay) on the outside.  For some things I've also just etched out the shape of the stones, for things where cut stone might be applicable.  The former option of creating little flat stones as a facade is definitely the most tedious and time consuming, but creates a pretty nice effect.  I have a feeling it look even better once I've painted it all, perhaps leaving the underlying Das Clay unpainted, as it is already white and might give the look of mortar).  I may also experiment with fitting the flat facade stones, but not attaching them, and then letting them dry individually so I can paint them before attaching.    Now it should be noted that since this is intended just as a playing environment for my nephew and his toys, I'm not exactly going for realism or accuracy.  But I imagine such techniques could be applied to a more realistic approach.  Indeed, I might even see if I can find some detailed castle building plans and attempt a realistic approach once this project is done."

modelmakers,33fb7i,rtwpsom2,1 point,Wed Apr 22 11:47:56 2015 UTC,"I bought four or five sets of theirs back in the late 90's early 00's.  While some of there generic stuff like gas cans and back packs were very well detailed, when it came to actual detail for the kit they were atrocious.  It was mostly made up shit they pulled out of their ass for the sake of making a model look detailed. They certainly weren't accurate.  At that point I just said to hell with it and threw their stuff away."

I could honest to god do a better job with a pen and post-it note. Anyways, Cheers on the build man. A lot of their diorama sets, when detailed and highlighted with artist oils, can come out gorgeous."

I wasn't aware of this kit, even though I scour Scalemates and the website of my LHS for stuff to add to my wishlist. I've been looking for a nice, not too expensive kit with a full interior to see what i can make of it. The most detailed tank interior I've done to date is the fighting compartment of a 1/35 Italeri Sd.Kfz. 234/2 Puma. And that featured a breech, commander and gunner seats, and two drivers seats with steering wheels and a radio.. And this kit is just over my monthly model kit budget. (I usually go way past my budget...)  But I really like making aircraft cockpits, so I wanted to try a full (or at least a more detailed) interior."

modelmakers,33cgc9,alaskafish,1 point,Tue Apr 21 12:04:35 2015 UTC,"What model of Paasche do you have? I use a VLS with the #1 needle. The VLS is a dual action brush with a needle limiter (tiny dial right in front of the trigger) that I use to 'fake' a single action brush for really fine lines. Set the pressure to about 8psi, open the limiter a touch until you get a super fine light spray when you press the trigger. If you leave the the needle protecting cap on it makes a really fine line but makes it trickier to clean the tip. With the cap off it widens the spray pattern a touch but gives you easy access to the needle (be careful with the cap off, don't bend that needle!). I usually spray at a distance of about 2-3 cm at most with the cap off so I can occasionally clean the needle tip if needed. This results in line about 1-2 mm wide."
modelmakers,33cgc9,Ghoda,1 point,Tue Apr 21 13:41:21 2015 UTC,"I own both a badger velocity and a paasche talon. Out of the box the Badger sprays a finer line (because it has a thinner needle - .21mm vs the talon's .38mm) with, imo, a more controlled spray. The paasche can be altered and I recently ordered a smaller needle and cap for finer lines (.25mm I believe). They both also have a pre-set needle stop to help with finer lines. The feel of the badger is also sturdier. I like the Badger a little more but am happy with my Paasche.

A little razor saw like those can make very clean cuts and give you very precise control over your cuts. For example, I've used mine to very precisely cut out the handles on a 1/35-scale M2 .50 cal machine gun. (They were molded like a solid U-shape of plastic, so I cut out the solid parts so it would look better, leaving the handles.)

For the paints, if you want to be economical, get only the color sets that you are going to use for your current model.

modelmakers,33996x,ManaNanner,2,Mon Apr 20 17:45:08 2015 UTC,All I could suggest is some sort of vintage aircraft group (maybe try googling a flying p51 and seeing if you can contact whoever is keeping it in the air) or maybe putting a request for the plans off the us air force maybe  Please keep us posted on this as it sounds like an amazing project
modelmakers,33996x,JohnBox93,1 point,Mon Apr 20 20:24:46 2015 UTC,Thanks! Didn't even think of trying to contact someone who maintains one! And of course I'll keep everyone updated!  :)

I'm new to projects like these in general so it didn't even cross my mind to contact someone who actually owns one. Ya, I always thought how cool it was that people could make such detailed models but the REALLY detailed ones are so rare that I figured I might as well give it a try. I have all the tools necessary to do it from scratch. Biggest problem I have right now is just trying to figure out how to start the project. Hopefully I can get the design knocked out within a month once I find some references. Thanks for the support! :)"
modelmakers,33996x,rtwpsom2,2,Mon Apr 20 21:53:26 2015 UTC,I might be able to help.
