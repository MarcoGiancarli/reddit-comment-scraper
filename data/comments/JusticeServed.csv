JusticeServed,3cuiqn,DrMnhttn,3,Sun Jul 12 12:14:37 2015 UTC,"His turn into the corner was fine considering he was under pressure. He even did a good job because he slowed down in a straight line before he entered the turn. Driving on a public road is different than driving on a racetrack.  Otherwise than that, the thief is so fat that the police needed to attach two pairs of handcuffs together. I feel sorry for bike."
JusticeServed,3cuiqn,ORP7,-1,Mon Jul 13 11:24:43 2015 UTC,"His turn into the corner was fine considering he was under pressure.   What you do under pressure is a reflection of what you practice when you aren't under pressure. :)  My guess is that rider doesn't practice lines much at all.  Have you read Total Control?  The author has this concept of a ""panic threshold.""  A speed at which our brains shut down conscious thought and go on auto pilot.  Some people's thresholds are way higher than others, but everybody has one.  The idea is that when we cross that threshold, our body operates on muscle memory and does whatever we've been practicing.  That's why it's important to practice things at low speed until they become automatic.   Driving on a public road is different than driving on a racetrack.   You're right,  but only in so much as good lines are even more important on the street. :)  Good lines on the street matter for safety and not for speed.  For one thing, your placement within the lane makes a huge difference in visibility.  From the outside of the corner, you can see much further around the bend.  It gives you more time to react to threats.  More importantly, crashing on the street has far worse consequences.  If you enter a right hand corner from the left side of the track, you go straight off into a nice, flat runoff area designed for the purpose.  If you dump the bike, there's an ambulance on stand by.  The paramedics might even be watching you crash.  If you enter a right hand corner from the left side of the street, you hit a curb or some bushes if you're lucky.  If you aren't lucky, you hit a tree or an oncoming car or someone's kid.  Then you lay on the ground and bleed for half an hour while you wait for an ambulance if there was someone there to see you and dial 911.  So it isn't just about going fast.  Proper lane positioning will save your life."
JusticeServed,3cuiqn,DrMnhttn,1 point,Mon Jul 13 13:36:18 2015 UTC,I'm not a book reader other than programming texts. You're right that a better line into the corner would allow him to take the corner faster. It's strange that neither of their bikes have mirrors.  I can forgive any rookie mistake except braking while leaning. That's really dangerous.

That's completely false.  She slides by, very smoothly, and beats him to the spot.  He very awkwardly elbows her in the back and forces his way past her.  Anyone with any concert or crowded bar experience knows that he was in breach of established edict.    And I am by no means defending her.  She's an idiot who decided to fight a well conditioned athlete and deserved what she got.  Because the universe.  Having said that, so did he.

State Attorney Willie Meggs told the paper that ""it's clear from the investigation"" into the June 24 incident at a Tallahassee bar that Johnson, 19, was first to initiate contact with the 21-year-old female FSU student as she attempted to approach the bar.  ""A person's entitled to use self-defense if they're being battered by someone else, and she certainly was entitled to do what she did,"" Meggs said. ""She didn't commit a crime is the reason she's not charged with a crime.""   He was elbowing her in the back, she turned to confront him and he pushed her in the mid-section. She then put her left arm out in a defensive action to maintain separation from him while putting up her right arm. After a few seconds he grabs her arm and shoves her into a fellow patron. She raises her leg to maintain separation and he starts to jerk her forward. Just after he does this she attempts to strike him with her free hand. He then punches in the face and runs.  It's clear in the video that he initiated contact (both incidental and non-incidental) and was the instigator. She was merely defending herself (from an idiot) and doesn't deserve punishment. It's all clearly in the video.   Anyone that thinks he should eat shit because he's on a football team...   Well, he did agree to a code of conduct to play for FSU. He violated that code by underage drinking and committing misdemeanor battery. If he didn't want the consequences he shouldn't have signed the contract. It's not like they're asking a lot of the guy. They're just asking him to obey the law. Seriously, how hard is that?

NOTE: She is not trying to defend herself or prevent Johnson from entering ""her"" personal space -- she is trying to prevent him from getting to the bar to order, just to be a dick.

He pulls her arm down, showing her the utter ridiculousness and futility of her threatening action.    What threatening action?

When he grabs her arm is when she responds, and rightly so.     0:23 - Fed up with her pussypass bullshit, Johnson sizes Drunk chick up and unleases a wicked slap with the right hand.    You've made it clear throughout this that you are looking at this from a misogynistic view. Your language is clearly derogatory towards several women in this silent, partially obscured, cctv footage.

Seriously? Explain that to me in a logical manner that doesn't just revolve around the fact that the woman was/is weaker, because that's a bullshit excuse.  By the way, as I pointed out elsewhere, it's absolutely horrendous that people think HER response was perfectly proportionate, that is, punching a person in the face simply for being jostled at a crowded bar, but HIS response, returning a punch, is somehow reprehensible and disproportionate.

JusticeServed,3cfg8x,snapper1971,-2,Sat Jul 11 04:26:21 2015 UTC,"We don't know what provoked her reaction.   We do know that the professional athlete had already demonstrated his physical superiority by grabbing the woman and forcing her arm into a different position. Of the two, he was more able to defend without the need to punch her in the face.   Then there are his actions immediately after the punch. Had he been justified in physically assaulting the woman with his clenched fist, he would not then have fled the scene. He would have been calling for witnesses. His actions speak volumes as to his cognizance of the crime he has just committed."

You think it's reasonable to punch a person for something that was said to them? 'Cause if so, there are a lot more women out there needing a solid fist to the face. If that's not your opinion, then what about what you see in the video justifies punching the man, seriously? Pay attention to what happens, purely physically. Remember that words aren't a reason to punch someone in a bar.  They jostle around (at a crowded bar), fine, that could be anyone's fault. Maybe she was pushy, maybe he was, maybe they both were. However, she clearly attempts to swing at him before he's done anything but shove a bit for space at the bar (common, by the way), at which point he grabs her wrists and simply holds her off.  Then she tries to swing again and hits him in the face, and then he clearly gets fed up with her bullshit and gives her what she's begging for.  If anything, the fact that he initially did nothing but attempt to calmly restrain her should be a point in his favor, yet you and many others keep pointing to that as a sign of aggression. No, that was his attempt to retain control without having to punch the bitch. That moment was the when he did ""the right thing"" and just tried to de-escalate an altercation with a weaker person. He demonstrated that he was clearly stronger and in control by simply holding her back. She didn't take the goddamned hint and swung at him when she got free, at which point he responded in kind. I see nothing vague about the situation whatsoever.  Also, you think it's strange he fled the scene, considering all the responses in here, and considering the judgment he got? It's positively insane the amount of shit women get away with simply for being physically weaker."

When I say defended himself, she was continuing to try to assault him even after the punch. His punch not only broke her grip on him but allowed his escape.

Thanks almighty fat fuck internet moron for that bit of insight and wisdom. It didnt matter that he wasnt supposed to be there, he was gonna get that damn drink wasnt he!?   He defended himself.   He defended himself by first trying to block her and then stepping back. Too bad genius St. DeAndre dumbfuck calculated a blow to her face at full force like the wife beating, baby momma having, prison going piece of shit he is setting himself up to be. It takes a coward to hit a woman in a situation like that. Sorry you got bullied by girls as a pussy child and now you think its okay to hit them.    I say defended himself, she was continuing to try to assault him even after the punch. His punch not only broke her grip on him but allowed his escape.   Ya well the prosecutors and his coach watched the same video and they didnt see what you apparently saw. But i mean the prosecutors couldnt have any legal knowledge right? Fucking idiot. Nobody cares what you think. St. DeAndre was in fact charged. and let me repeat that for you: prosecutors watched the same video you did. jesus you are a fucking twat arent you?   Honestly the most logical thing to do from a normal person. Had he continued to hit her, that's where it becomes strictly retaliation. Oh and she was also kneeing him, you can see it in the video.   No no no child. Normal men dont hit women unless they are in danger. You act as if this prison bound piece of shit was in danger. Sorry, but i have never felt in Danger when my gf or my sister swings on me. It has happened before. St. DeAndre is also a world class piece of shit, ahem ""athlete,"" that plays a full contact sport and you mean to tell me some white girl threatened his safety and could have caused him bodily injury? I see, you somehow think any type of punch regardless of context makes retaliation okay. Try that in public. Hit a woman after provoking her in a bar. Enjoy the ass whooping you get.

Apparently what he did didnt fall in that definition you stupid fucking coward-ass piece of shit, pussy, woman hitting asshole. APPARENTLY FUCKING NOT. He got charged. Prosecutors dont charge people unless they think they can convince a jury to convict him.  They will. Because he didnt defend himself. He entered an establishment illegally (probably the first of many times for this class act)  and then proceeded to get into a fight,with a woman, OVER A SPOT AT THE BAR.

I'm definitely expecting down votes but I'm really surprised at all how popular this opinion is on this website. You shouldn't need to throw a hay maker at somebody who is noticeably smaller and weaker than you. Men are bigger and stronger than women. A punch from a grown man can cause serious damage and is more than enough to subdue a woman. A man should be able to defend himself and stop a female attacker with less than a strike to the head/face. Punching somebody with full force who is smaller and weaker than you, even if they attacked you first (unless they have a weapon) is wrong and unnecessary in my opinion."

Most rational people already understand that there is a reasonable way to defend yourself against weaker opponents. I don't know why you keep bringing up the fact that women are generally weaker, it really doesn't matter. I'm a man and any NFL player could smash me. The question is, why do I not walk up to an NFL player in a bar and take a swing, and why does a woman who is at an equally bad disadvantage do so without a care in the world? There is something going wrong with some women where they don't make the same observations that most people intuitively do: Bigger people than you can generally fuck you up.   You're trying to argue that men should always hold back when in a violent situation with women. That has nothing to do with the question of why women initiate the violence, which is what is being asked. But to address your argument, the law doesn't make a distinction, because the context is always taken into account. Saying ""but women are weaker"" is patronising, it's why women could not get equal treatment at work for a long time. It's all about whether that strength is relevant in the context. Is a particular woman strong enough to pull me out of a burning building? Yes? Good, then suit her up as a fire fighter. A woman equal in size and strength to me that is attacking me? I'm treating it the same as a man. It's not the gender that's going to harm me, it's what they're swinging at me."

If this fact is so obvious to everyone, then why do dumb bitches keep picking fights with men? And on a far more serious point, when are we going to start holding women responsible for their own actions? This shit is on par with cases where, if a guy and girl get drunk and have consensual sex, and the girl later changes her mind, the man is held entirely responsible for the whole thing . . . even though he was drunk too. What, are women just inherently so fucking feeble-minded that we can't expect them control their own actions? Why is it that a drunk man is expected to have his wits about him at all times, but a woman is always assumed to be a victim? Why is a man blamed for defending himself, when the woman was the one who initiated the attack? Everything is always the man's fault (except for when things go well, then the woman gets credit). Both of these types of cases really just indicate that women want no real responsibility. They just want protection and privilege, and to be treated with respect, without actually earning any of it.

The only reason people rely on their physicality to solve this kind of a problem is because their intellect fails them, in much the same way it's failing you now.   She didn't grab him; He grabbed her. If not for that, it's not likely she would have swung. HE initiated physical contact.

Let's just assume you're right about the fact that he grabbed her unprovoked (you're not), that DOES give her the right to swing as it is reasonable force for someone with her strength/ability to defend herself from being grabbed (aka battery). However, clearly her arm is up to threaten to punch SO for self defense, he grabs her arm. Again reasonable force for someone with his strength/ability. Next, she continues to knee him AS WELL as throw a punch with the left hand. SO in order to prevent all attacks on him, he throws a strong bunch in order to disengage, disorient her, and flee. Sounds like perfect self defense to me. Had he chosen to just grab her left arm as well after the punch, now he is in an awkward knee fight which could leave him with far more serious damage than her (testicles, in case you don't get it.) Clearly a punch was the best route as it allowed him to end it there without more damage."

I'm not debating that he can and did do more damage but so fucking what? She should have known the consequences of punching someone, not his fault she never learned when to back down. Bottom line if she didn't want to get punched in the face she shouldn't have punched him in the face, he never had intention to hurt her until then.  To point out some hypocrisy why do you make the argument that her punch was weak and that shouldn't have caused him to hit her.

Mountains of attorney fees to ensue.   Not an equal rights issue. He was never under any real threat because of her appearance and strictly what happened on video. If it was a huge woman equally as strong as him and punched first with full force, an equal or more powerful response would be  justified. Has nothing to do with gender and everything to do with level of threat. Pulverizing someone who couldn't easily equally do the same to you is the definition of a low life.

Also, the qb's lawyer said he was embarrassed by his reaction. Why embarrassed if so many think he was justified?

(WOOD) — Dash cam video shows a Calhoun County sheriff’s deputy being arrested for driving drunk in Kalamazoo.  Noemi Garza faces charges of operating while intoxicated, failure to stop after collision, attempted resisting and obstructing an officer and possession of a firearm while under the influence.  She was arrested following a crash in the area of Douglas Avenue and Forbes Street in the early hours of June 13.  Dash cam video obtained by 24 Hour News 8 on Thursday shows Garza being pulled over and talking to police. It also shows officers finding a gun in her purse. When asked if she has a concealed pistol license (CPL), she responded that she works for the Calhoun County Sheriff’s Office.  Court records show Garza refused to take a breathalyzer test, resulting in a fine.  Dash cam video then shows officers put Garza in the backseat of a patrol car. Investigators say she was drunk, rowdy and even tried to kick out the back window of the cruiser.  “No, I’m fine, I’m gonna refuse everything,” Garza said while in the back of the cruiser. “I’m f****** ready. Take me down to the Gd* county. Whatever, b****. Hurry up.”  Court documents say her blood alcohol content level (BAC) — determined after a blood test at a local hospital — was .17, more than twice Michigan’s legal limit to drive of .08.  The Calhoun County Sheriff’s Office is not discussing the incident, but did say the deputy has been placed on administrative leave while it conducts an internal investigation.  Garza is expected to be arraigned Friday.  Share this: Email  Print  Facebook  Twitter  Google  Pinterest  More  LinkedIn  Tumblr  Reddit    I'm a bot. Feedback? Get in touch here."

While writing a ticket for one driver, a second driver -- who police believe was texting and driving -- hit the officer's motorcycle near the intersection of westbound highway 183 and Belt Line Road. The motorcycle nearly hit the officer after impact, but the driver didn't stop.  ""I got one running,"" said the officer on police radio traffic. ""I've been hit on the highway. The guy I was writing a ticket to just fled.""  The officer, whose name hadn't been released Wednesday, added that the truck who hit him also fled the scene.  What happened next is the bizarre part.  The motorist who was receiving a ticket from the officer took off and chased the hit-and-run driver, police said. He tracked down the suspect after the suspect exited at Esters Road a short distance from the crash.  Dashcam video released by Irving Police shows multiple officers apprehending the suspect in front of a La Quinta Inn & Suites. One officer can be heard on radio transmission saying the suspect was ""in custody.""  Dashcam video shows the pursuit and detainment of the suspect in a hit-and-run crash Tuesday.  In multiple 911 calls obtained by News 8, passersby told police that a man with a knife had another man pinned to the ground outside the hotel. Police stated on radio traffic that the citizen holding down the suspect was the original driver who was pulled over.  That driver would not receive a ticket, police told News 8. He was given a warning.  It was unclear how exactly the first driver got the suspect to the ground after the brief chase. A full police report had not been released Wednesday afternoon.  One lane of westbound Highway 183 was closed for an investigation Tuesday.  Watch the raw video of the officer's motorcycle being struck below or here.

JusticeServed,3awlub,Reddit_is_my_Home,-5,Fri Jun 26 03:37:12 2015 UTC,"Because a bear is a bear and a human is a human. You're right, you can't expect a bear to respect your rights as an individual and you have to respect that bear's power but a cop, a HUMAN, can damn sure be held responsible for abusing his/her power. There's plenty of people out there who get jammed up by Johnny Law because they tried to respectfully excercise their rights and the cop simply wasn't having it. Does that mean you should never stand up for yourself? I don't think it does."

These 'freemen' assert a faulty interpretation of the law that they believe excuses them from having to obey it. This is not a matter of abuse of police power, but a matter of common citizens refusing to obey laws, and the police enforcing those laws-- which is their job to do."

JusticeServed,396hbm,joephusweberr,9,Wed Jun 10 15:55:02 2015 UTC,"I read an article recently which talked about this. It's like a vicious circle where a guy who may be making regular child support payments will be living paycheck to paycheck and have something come up (small financial emergency... illness, injury, not enough hours at work this week, car broke down, whatever) which makes it so he can't make the child support payment. He ends up in jail because of that, which means he can't go to work and earn any more money (or they suspend his driver's license, which means he can't go to work, which means he loses his job), which means he can't make any more child support payments, and then he ends up in and out of jail forever.... It seems totally fucked up - a poor man can't pay child support, so you throw him in jail so you remove any ability to make money and fuck up his ability to find employment afterwards? Insanity.  ninja edit - found it: http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/20/us/skip-child-support-go-to-jail-lose-job-repeat.html?_r=1  Article mentions Walter Scott a lot. Apparently he paid child support for years, spent two weeks in jail, lost his job because of the jail, couldn't pay child support, went back to jail, got out of jail, couldn't pay the child support, went back in, a bunch of times. Ran because he didn't want to go back to jail."

If you go to jail and lose your job because of it, and repeatedly get sent back to jail (including running because you don't like jail), than you get exactly what you'd expect.

JusticeServed,396hbm,m3ckano,6,Fri Jun 12 03:03:05 2015 UTC,"Did you read the article? The child support payments dictated by the court system do not take into account the income of the father. The punishment (jail) was designed to discourage people with money but who don't want to pay from skipping out on payments; throwing people in jail for simply being too poor to pay is insanity. It's only a good idea if you imagine that every single person who doesn't pay child support has the means to do it but doesn't on purpose. Otherwise, you're actually hurting the person who's too poor to pay child support, and you're hurting the other parent and the child, since you're negatively impacting the father's earning potential in the future.   If the parent who is taking care of the child had the same problem, they would have to deal with it.    You're wrong; if the parent of the child doesn't have enough money, they get financial assistance - they don't go to jail. If the father can't make his payment, he goes to jail, and then begins the vicious cycle of not being able to afford the next payment, which puts him into jail again, forever. In addition, ""Critics of the child support system say this imbalance is reflected in rules that say that if a mother receives public assistance, the father must pay it back, even if he is also poor. ""   People who owe child support are usually scumbags who don't understand there is another living being they are responsible for.   I think you'd need to back up that accusation. Walter Scott, in particular, seems like he tried to support his children as much as possible. See here ""Lisa Scott could not be reached at addresses or phone numbers listed in her name. Samantha Scott, a daughter from Mr. Scott’s first relationship, said she had never heard her own mother complain about a lack of support. “If he had money, he would give it to us,” she said.""  Let's say you have a kid, and then divorce, and are ordered by the court to bay $30,000 a year in child support, but you lose your job and then only can find a new one making $25,000 a year.

Slager, who was fired from the North Charleston Police Department shortly after the video went public in April, is still in jail and so far, his attorneys have made no request for bail, according to the New York Times.  A trial date has not been set but Slager faces between to 30 years to life in prison if convicted.  And while we should expect the usual “officer safety” arguments to justify the killing of Walter Scott, the 50-year-old man pulled over for a broken tail light before he fled to avoid going to jail on unpaid child support payments, it is going be almost impossible to present that argument without being laughed out of court because of the video.  The video, recorded by a man named Feidin Santana who was walking to work that day, was not published online until several days after the April 4th incident.  Prior to that, the North Charleston Police Department gave the usual spiel that Slager was in fear for his life, so naturally, he had the right to kill Scott.  Once the video surfaced, Slager’s attorney withdrew from his face, the cop was fired from his job and was charged with murder within hours – almost an anomaly when it comes to these shootings where the cops are usually placed on paid administrative leave for months in the hopes the public forgets about it.  So far, the second North Charleston police officer who responded to the incident, Clarence W. Habersham, who seemed to go along with Slager’s story, has not been charged or disciplined.  Scott owed $18,000 in child support. A 2009 study indicated that one-eighth of all inmates in South Carolina were incarcerated for failing to pay child support payments.  I'm a bot.

It would be the exact same scenario if the biker was in a car, if you're in a car and someone cuts you off or nearly sideswipes you(whether accidental or on purpose) the logical thing to do is to avoid the collision and then keep your distance because you now know that the other driver is likely to cause a collision and you don't want to be involved. The completely illogical thing to do is try forcing the car that cut you off back into the lane they came from or cutting them off as revenge, that's just stupid and only serves to cause even more danger to yourself, the original offender and anyone else in your immediate area. Once again, the car here isn't innocent by any means, but there was no need for the bike to continue putting himself at risk of being hit just for the sake of proving some point.

JusticeServed,38r7vn,FishstickIsles,6,Sun Jun 7 01:30:51 2015 UTC,"That's a car2go share scheme car, judging by the paint job and logo. To use those you have to put a personal PIN into the system, and I think they are GPS tracked too.  The Police will have no trouble identifying the driver, it just may take a day or two to get the info.  I got the impression the guy was being swarmed and was just desperate to get away as well."
JusticeServed,38r7vn,SexyLoverBoy,5,Sun Jun 7 09:30:50 2015 UTC,It says they didn't catch the driver yet in the video's description.
JusticeServed,38r7vn,TheSoftBoiledEgg,8,Sat Jun 6 12:34:03 2015 UTC,Seems like the dude was being swarmed and got scared when they went after him so he tried to escape. I cant say who was at fault from the beginning judging by this video however.
JusticeServed,38r7vn,Hojeekush,-1,Sat Jun 6 04:13:51 2015 UTC,"well the guy who ran off after hitting the innocent car trying to drive was at fault, for one. don't overthink it; for that to be justified the threat would have to be exceptional (like a gun pointed in his face).  He reacted like a bot in GTAV . ."
JusticeServed,38r7vn,G37_is_numberletter,3,Mon Jun 8 17:10:07 2015 UTC,OMG! A crazy scene is unfolding on the street. Better point the camera at the sky!

JusticeServed,38m0au,FishstickIsles,21,Fri Jun 5 02:18:42 2015 UTC,was that my first worldstarhiphop video that didn't make me feel ashamed to be human?
JusticeServed,38m0au,OneRobotMotherfucker,6,Fri Jun 5 05:14:51 2015 UTC,"Certainly was mine, must be the end of an era.   RIP WorldStarHipHop - 2005-2015."
JusticeServed,38m0au,disorderlee,5,Fri Jun 5 07:19:09 2015 UTC,"Nobody was shouting ""WORLDSTAR"" over and over either. Very strange."
JusticeServed,38m0au,Random_Link_Roulette,16,Sat Jun 6 19:46:21 2015 UTC,"The guy holding him in the hold is a good person, good on him."
JusticeServed,38m0au,DatJazz,3,Fri Jun 5 05:09:01 2015 UTC,I was really confused at first. I thought the guy holding him was the mugger and the guy on top was trying to stop him getting away.
JusticeServed,38m0au,wellwhatishername,11,Thu Jun 11 10:48:38 2015 UTC,"That was so great because he probably thought no one would stop him. Think again, numbskull."
JusticeServed,38m0au,Hojeekush,13,Fri Jun 5 02:55:34 2015 UTC,"""Do you want to press charges?""  ""Yes, he's an asshole!""  I think the cops will be more interested that he's a mugger."
JusticeServed,38m0au,ShiaLaBuff,0,Fri Jun 5 10:19:19 2015 UTC,"No they'll shoot and mace assholes too, they don't discriminate."
