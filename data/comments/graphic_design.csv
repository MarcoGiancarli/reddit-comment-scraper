graphic_design,3e2vtl,qqg3,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:45:50 2015 UTC,The reason designers would want PDF format is to prevent people from mucking with the design - not to preserve editability.

He would make you submit screens caps of all your project folders expanded and dock you marks if files/folders were misnamed or misplaced.

Get into the habit, rename indesign/ pdf files by docket number or creation date, package the final indesign files, rename file assets descriptively.

And my beef is that adobe did put it into some applications, and left it out of others.   It's akin to not having an ""open"" command in the file menu of one application.

The apps were all built to open something from the start, they weren't all built to autosave.  Take a look at illys files, they can be huge. I can wait minuites for some ai files to save, even longer for some Photoshop docs. Indesign/after effects/ premiere however mostly reference other files on disk. Their native files are usually tiny with a larger supporting folder of assets. So autosave in one can be done quickly, with minimum fuss and even with backup files you can revert too. The others might lock up the app while saving every 10 mins which no-one would want. (Try the autosavouir plugin for illy which does this a fair bit)"

Sometimes something really is final, and I want to know that when I look at the file. I don't want to look at the file and see ""filename_4"" and wonder what the status of that job is.

graphic_design,3dzzdn,decavolt,11,Tue Jul 21 00:52:00 2015 UTC,"This is the best way. Often no other versioning number system is required other than the one we all live by – the date.  Year first, then month, then day. So it sorts correctly."
graphic_design,3dzzdn,raustin33,13,Tue Jul 21 05:20:49 2015 UTC,"Often no other versioning number system is required other than the one we all live by – the date.   I agree for the most part but would like to give a suggestion for when you do need a different numbering system than the day. If you work on a project, and save, multiple times throughout the day then the date may not be a good solution.  You can have a version naming system with 3 numbers that works quiet well DesignName-0.0.0.psd   0.0.0    First number indicates when a design has been launched. For example a new project would be 0 as nothing has been released yet or considered ""final"".   0.0.0    Second number is for when you add a new feature. Say I start a new project and draw a circle, then save, the number would be 0.1.0 for 1 feature. If I add a square and save again the number would be 0.2.0 for 2 features.    0.0.0    Third number is when you make changes and have different saves for the same feature. The square was white when I saved so when I change the color to red and save then the number would be 0.2.1 for 2 features with 1 change to the latest feature.     It may seem complex but essentially the pattern goes as such: (New Live Version.  New Features Have Been Added . New) A new project would start off as 0.1.0 because nothing has been launched but a feature, or features, have been added. This naming system can help you track versions of the file that have been launched live, such as in the case you may need to revert back to an older version. In a date only system you have to remember when you launched the design to be live, or 'final'. With the number system all you have to do is look at the first number to see which launched version the design is such as 1.0.0 or 2.0.0.  Once you have the naming system down you can then keep track of the changes in a version log, a text document type file to track the changes in each version. For example:   0.1.0   Logo Sketches Added Logo Outline   0.1.1   Logo Sketches Removed   0.2.0   Vector Added to Logo Outline    Edit: Thanks to /u/actionscripted I have learned this is called semantic versioning and have found a website that gives a more detailed explanation. http://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html Although I will mention this is mostly used in programming and the description is written for programmers."
graphic_design,3dzzdn,thisdesignup,9,Tue Jul 21 09:29:09 2015 UTC,Semantic version in a design sub? Nice.
graphic_design,3dzzdn,actionscripted,5,Tue Jul 21 11:19:22 2015 UTC,Oh! I didn't realize the naming structure had a name and was a thing. I'm glad you mentioned it because now I found a much better description at http://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html
graphic_design,3dzzdn,thisdesignup,4,Tue Jul 21 14:40:04 2015 UTC,"The problem with that system is that it's still largely arbitrary as it's based on your own private criteria as to what determines a change in each variable. There's no way to look at those files as a third party and in any way understand intuitively what the difference is between them.  While one could argue that might be irrelevant if it's your naming for your files, that really only works in the context of freelance or private work within your bubble. As soon as your files involve other people, even if sending to clients for review let alone coworkers all working on the same project, the ability for someone to decipher your naming system becomes integral to it's objective success.  If instead, you use the date format (YYYY-MM-DD), and then amend the end with a more general incremental number (v01, v02, etc) such that multiple files from the same day would end with 2015-07-21-v01 and 2015-07-21-v02 etc, then at least without any explanation, I can look at that and easily determine that it's a date, and a version number, where v10 is clearly 9 edits/revisions/versions past v01 which generally is all I really need to know in terms of revised or incremental versions.  Beyond that, if there is a need to specify what might be changed or what a given version might be, that's where actually just specifying the change or version descriptor is the most efficient. If you have two versions of a logo, one with a square and one with a circle, as an example, instead of just ending with 01.06.11 as a version number, it's better to go with 2015-07-21-v01-circle and 2015-07-21-v02-square. With your system, only you would be able to tell the difference and you may forget. With my system, you could be seeing these file names for the first time and deduce the difference.   In a slightly more advanced case, like say where you have a blue square and a red square version, I might even ammend the version as v02a and v02b. So you'd have:   DesignLogo-2015-07-21-v01-Circle.indd DesignLogo-2015-07-21-v02a-Square-Red.indd DesignLogo-2015-07-21-v02b-Square-Blue.indd DesignLogo-2015-07-21-v03a-Triangle-Colour.indd DesignLogo-2015-07-21-v03b-Triangle-Greyscale.indd   Although generally, I only involve a date in the file name if it's especially relevant, usually when sending files to people to differentiate immediate to them what is the most current version. If I was actually working on a logo and had those versions, my files would look more like:   DesignLogo-v01-Circle.indd DesignLogo-v02a-Square-Red.indd DesignLogo-v02b-Square-Blue.indd DesignLogo-v03a-Triangle-Colour.indd DesignLogo-v03b-Triangle-Greyscale.indd"

Check here for a good description: http://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html  I understand your naming structure and can see use for adding details such as what was added to the file. Although doing so can create very long file names. Where is the limit? How do you decide how much information to add? Do you list out everything that was added and changed? If you really want to keep track of the versions then you can create a version log file, could be a simple text document, where changes to each version are recorded. For example    0.1.0    Logo Sketches Added Logo Outline   0.1.1   Logo Sketches Removed   0.2.0   Vector Added to Logo Outline    So you have the base file, changes to the base file, then new content added. You have the versions and have recorded what each version change means. A lot of video games keep track of versions that way, if you have ever heard of ""patch notes"". Patch notes are usually released with a version number. The same thing could be applied to the situation we are discussing. You could also include these patch notes whenever you share the file with someone else so they can see exactly what changes have been made or what content has been added.   Also, one thing to point out, your suggestion of v01a and v01b is similar 0.1.0 and 0.1.1. Except the structure I suggested only uses numbers to define versions. It keeps things cleaner that way and easier to read."

As I have learned this is a tried and true system that many people use, especially in software design and programming. Check here for a good description: http://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html   But that's the whole problem. Good file naming shouldn't require someone to read essentially a manual on how to decipher it.   In the context of software, the version naming system is only efficient at simply tracking version numbers as a reference to what each version entails. It's a reference number, not a descriptor of what the version includes. The version numbers themselves say nothing beyond a number. Without the context of release notes and related documentation, the number only has meaning as relative to other version numbers.   Software versions are also generally always moving forward, correct? Such a naming convention doesn't really address the situations in design where everything is not always a revision or improvement, but can often be variations. If you have 4-5 different concepts of a logo at the development stage, they are all theoretically at the same developmental stage, meaning they still need another identifier in the name, which gets into more potential confusion when different concepts perhaps involve differing levels of revisions before a final direction is chosen.    You could also include these patch notes whenever you share the file with someone else so they can see exactly what changes have been made or what content has been added.   And that's my whole point. This kind of naming would be a nightmare in a team or group environment where you have multiple people working on the same files, or moving from project to project. Whether it's knowing what you're looking at without having to open it, being able to find a file either via a folder structure or via a search, this kind of thing is integral. It's not building a research library with a dewey decimal system, it's about intuitively (or at least, with minimal reasoning required) and efficiently being able to find what you want, when you want it, no matter who made the file. If I have to open up 10 different files to figure out which one I'm looking for, or scroll through some Word file of version notes, or worst of all, if I have to go through someone else to find something, that's not in any way ideal."
graphic_design,3dzzdn,moreexclamationmarks,0,Tue Jul 21 15:19:39 2015 UTC,"But that's the whole problem. Good file naming shouldn't require someone to read essentially a manual on how to decipher it.   You learn it once and then you understand. It is a system that many use so it's not something that you wouldn't use but once. We use a lot of things that require us to learn and there is nothing wrong with that. Why is it bad if a file naming system has you needing to learn something? Names are not an end all anyway. It would be too much if a file naming system labeled every single change that happened in a file.   Software versions are also generally always moving forward, correct?   Depends, sometimes you move backwards if something doesn't work. I'm not entirely sure how this differs from design. Isn't design always moving forward too?    If you have 4-5 different concepts of a logo at the development stage, they are all theoretically at the same developmental stage, meaning they still need another identifier in the name, which gets into more potential confusion when different concepts perhaps involve differing levels of revisions before a final direction is chosen.   And that is where that first name comes into play before the version numbers. You can still put as much information as you want in the name that appears before the version number.   LogoConceptA_0.0.0  LogoConceptB_0.0.0  LogoConceptC_0.0.0  Etc.  Each concept would get it's own file with it's own version numbers.    If I have to open up 10 different files to figure out which one I'm looking for, or scroll through some Word file of version notes, or worst of all, if I have to go through someone else to find something, that's not in any way ideal.   I am a bit confused. It wasn't 10 files it was just one version notes file that I was suggesting. In a team setting this could work too. Someone makes a change, saves it as a new version and then defines their version in the version log. Anyone else can look at the version log to see exactly what was done and know what version to go back to if they want to undo the changes.  The only other option is to include the changes in the name of the file. While that works it doesn't tell you when those changes have been applied. You still need some sort of numbering system to know that. You and I are suggesting two system that could work together."

So in terms of InDesign files, I might see:   DesignLogo-v01-Circle.indd DesignLogo-v02a-Square-Red.indd DesignLogo-v02b-Square-Blue.indd DesignLogo-v03a-Triangle-Colour.indd DesignLogo-v03b-Triangle-Greyscale.indd   But in terms of the PDFs, I might see:   DesignLogo-2015-07-10-v01-Circle.pdf DesignLogo-2015-07-12-v02a-Square-Red.pdf DesignLogo-2015-07-12-v02b-Square-Blue.pdf DesignLogo-2015-07-15-v03a-Triangle-Colour.pdf DesignLogo-2015-07-15-v03b-Triangle-Greyscale.pdf"

""name-072115"", ""name-072115v2"", ""name-072215"", etc. and obviously latest date (or highest version/revision) is the most recent.  My boss is horrible about naming files and it's such a hassle to try to work on something he started.

Now, I drill it into my designers to use names that make some sort of sense and to please please please keep in mind that someone else is probably going to be looking for that file some day.   I used to use the same MMDDYY format you use, but it doesn't numerically sort newest to oldest, especially with multiple years. YYMMDD or YYYYMMDD does.      name-060115 name-070414 (last year) name-072115 name-072215 name-072315       I do the vX thing though too for files from the same day. I just use decimals.      name-20140704 name-20150723.1 name-20150723.2      Another trick I learned from my first agency gig was to give every client a 3-letter short-name so they could at least be alpha sorted. So Apple would be maybe APL, Joe's Lizard Farm would be JLF, etc. Then inside if that, a new folder for each job like so:      JLF      • docs • materials • messages JLF001 JLF002   lizardcard-v2015001.psd"

My boss usually ends up telling me to get it done, and that he'll eat the cost of my (arguably) short amount of time. How in the world do you keep clients happy, limit the revisions/headaches AND get paid for extra revisions all at the same time?

I tell them ""I need time to set this up for the printer"" or ""time to get the hosting straightened out."" Give a reason. ""I want to make sure we don't slip the deadline.""

graphic_design,3e3ma1,CapControl,7,Tue Jul 21 18:25:36 2015 UTC,"I've been told by my attorney to gleefully sign any noncompete that's placed in front of me - he'll get it kicked to the curb as unenforceable.  A company can't NOT pay you and then expect you to forego the ability to put food on your table for 3 months after you're no longer working for them. And they can't expect that even if they do pay you, but when it's put in such simple terms it sounds pretty preposterous, doesn't it?  Nonsolicit and/or confidentiality agreements are a different matter, and I'd have no problem abiding by them as they don't preclude me from earning a living - I just can't do so on the backs of my former employer's clients.  THAT SAID: the only legal advice on the internet you should ever pay attention to, is to talk to an attorney."
graphic_design,3e3ma1,Manevitch,5,Tue Jul 21 19:07:39 2015 UTC,"If you're an intern, you usually aren't an employee. You need a lot more information regarding your status and reasoning before you should sign anything.  That said, they would need to enforce the contract for anything to actually happen. Why they would want to do that to an intern is beyond me."
graphic_design,3e3ma1,MikeOfTheBeast,3,Tue Jul 21 18:31:36 2015 UTC,"Exactly. They won't ever look you up and waste resources to go after you for getting a job afterwards. To be safe, don't update any social media about your new job until 3 months have passed."
graphic_design,3e3ma1,vix3l,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:44:49 2015 UTC,"Yeah, you're probably safe if you aren't rubbing it in or aren't some real big fish who can't steal clients or talent or trade secrets somewhere else. The chances that an intern does any of that is probably a huge zero."
graphic_design,3e3ma1,MikeOfTheBeast,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:05:43 2015 UTC,"I don't know where everyone gets the idea that design studios are all out to get each other? I live in a fair sized city (>1,000,000 people) and the design/print world is tight knit. All the print shops help each other when needed. No one worries about another shop stealing the client when they outsource a job. Design studios aren't hiding their client list in a safe. These contracts only have clauses like this to protect the studio or shop in a worst case scenario. Nothing is ever going to happen to you for getting a job soon after. Now... if you go to your new job and say ""Hey boss, I know how much my last employer was charging this client for this, and I know they would use us instead if we make a pitch and quote lower"".. chances are something WILL happen. You're boss will also realize you're untrustworthy and fire your sorry ass.   For the most part, the design world likes to help each other out, where I am at least."
graphic_design,3e3ma1,vix3l,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:16:22 2015 UTC,"Yeah. My area is 6M+ and there's a lot of places that have different niches.  I'd be far more worried about Directors, Account Executives or Marketing Managers. Us lowly designers don't really get crazy deep with clients if you're at an agency level. We don't schmooze anyone.   I've thought about quitting and just going freelance and getting in touch with clients to undercut an employer just as a scenario though. But again, you'd have to deal with them on another level that a lot of designers aren't interested in."
graphic_design,3e3ma1,MikeOfTheBeast,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:35:14 2015 UTC,"That's exactly it. A lot of designers aren't cut out for sales either. Especially sales in the design world where clients demand the most affordable yet best quality product and they want it yesterday.  I've worked at print shops, never an agency. In the print world it's a lot more common for the designer to be in touch with the client directly. It reduces the risk of error by cutting out the middle man and also makes for faster turnaround. Again, all the owners of the print shops know each other and if you screw one over... good luck being employed in another shop in the city."
graphic_design,3e3ma1,vix3l,2,Tue Jul 21 21:44:52 2015 UTC,"In various industries, companies like to scoop up recently let go or quit employees of their competitors to try and gather some secrets. I've even seen a designer intentionally get hired at a company, taking all the secrets, then returning back to the original company as if she was never fired.  I would imagine they are talking about direct competitors. If you work for Poster Company A, don't go and design for Poster Company B soon after quitting or getting fired. You can, though, go work for another company in a different industry or same industry that is not a direct competitor."
graphic_design,3e3ma1,raazurin,2,Tue Jul 21 19:38:01 2015 UTC,Contact your supervisor and ask about it. This could very well be legal speak that was copied/pasted from an existing employment document into the internship agreement.
graphic_design,3e3ma1,CyberneticCuntSmashr,3,Tue Jul 21 20:14:14 2015 UTC,"It's normal and probably more common than you think, especially in high tech areas like S.F. and Silicon Valley. Looks like it's part of a non-disclosure agreement. Some places do that especially in highly competitive industries. You can work wherever you want to while working their and after, but it can't be a competing company due to the info you'll be exposed to while working there. It's a blanket contract they probably give to all interns and designers so you don't go freelance for a competitor, or don't get bought out to go work for a competitor. It's a cutthroat industry out there so you can imagine google employees getting recruited to work for Bing or something. You can potentially share sensitive information. I've had to sign 3 similar non disclosure and compete clauses in my time."

It makes sense to make it illegal in CA.
graphic_design,3e3ma1,gradeAjoon,2,Tue Jul 21 19:17:26 2015 UTC,"According to a recent episode of Silicon Valley, yep. Non-competes are usually only effective in discouraging poaching of talent, or talent leaving with proprietary information to go to a competitor."
graphic_design,3e3ma1,CyberneticCuntSmashr,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:13:11 2015 UTC,"It means that you won't legally be able to get any kind of graphic design position with one of their competitors. If you end up getting a position of some kind in a separate industry within that time frame then you're fine. This practice is not unheard of in most industries, though it is more prevalent in others. To be fair, three months really is not that long, even though it could interfere with possible future opportunities depending on the timing of things.   You will have to weigh whether or the not the experience at that particular place is worth it for you to sign such a clause."

graphic_design,3e3w8q,vix3l,2,Tue Jul 21 19:58:35 2015 UTC,"Well, let me explain overprint first.   If you're designing without overprint, the object behind the other one will not exist. The one on front will always cut out the one behind it. When you use overprint, you're basically saying that you don't want that image to be cut out, you only want to print the front image ON TOP of the behind image.  Since your using Indesign just go to Window -> Output -> Attributes. Once that window is open, select your pictures that the issue is occurring with. Make sure you're using the ""Selection Tool"" (dark arrow pointer) and not the ""Direct Selection Tool"" (white arrow pointer). Once you have the picture selected, look at the Attributes window that we just opened up. ""Overprint Fill"" Should not have a line or check in it. The same goes for the Present on your master page.  Let me know how that works!"

graphic_design,3e2gzv,beardimbolo,4,Tue Jul 21 13:18:24 2015 UTC,"I've moved for my career. I'd advise weekend trips to a few cities you're considering. Amtrak is your friend on the East Coast, you can get to quite a few that way on the cheap. Just take some time to look around and ask if you can see yourself living in those places. Is the culture, the neighborhoods, the commute, the cost of living in sync with where you want to be? You'll spend 1/3 of your life in a job but 1/3 of it outside of the office, so make sure you'll be somewhere you'll be happy.  Once you've got it narrowed down to location, I recommend taking a bit of time to polish the resume/portfolio up. Don't rush this part, make sure you're 100% confident behind the work and that the work you select is geared towards the job you want. One tip that helped me was leaving my address off the resume. Sometimes resumes get fed through computers and non-local addresses get canned. Or an HR person might favor local people over you since they'd be easier to bring in. I got zero call backs on my resume when my out-of-state address was on it, and then the calls came in the moment I took it off.   When you have your stuff together, start the search while still employed and try to line things up so you don't have a huge gap between paychecks when relocating. This cuts down on how much you'll need to save up, which can be a lot if you're moving to a place with a higher cost of living than you currently have. Once you start getting call backs, you'll (ideally) need to make another trip out for apt/housing scouting. You can search online, but I had much better luck lining up viewings in person. Easier to discern neighborhood, neighbors, safety, commute time, parking, local amenities, etc. that way. If you do go in person, be prepared and bring everything you'd need to place a deposit down on a place should you find something. Some places won't require much, some will require a security deposit, first and last month's rent all in advance. Also talk to your current landlord (if you have one) about breaking your lease or getting out of it. They appreciate the heads up and might not charge you if they can line up a new tenant before you move out.  I saved up around $7K for all expenses, including pre-move travel, moving supplies, truck rental, gas, tolls, hotel stay, movers, new apartment deposit and 1st month's rent, new utilities, new cleaning supplies, city parking permits, commuter rail pass, full order of groceries and supplies, and to cover three weeks gap while my new job payroll was processed. I moved to a high rent area and hired pro movers, so your cost may be much less depending.  Then, if everything lines up, give your two weeks notice and pull the trigger! It's crazy and stressful and a logisitical nightmare, but for me it was totally worth it. Much happier in my new job and new location."

graphic_design,3dzlzm,yourmumsalawyer,3,Mon Jul 20 20:36:27 2015 UTC,"As a designer, I look at the weathering on those lower case g's and see that they're identical and I realize it's all just a font. That typeface feels very trendy to me, a bit like the Nexa Rust family, but on Cooper. It's cool, but I wonder if it will feel dated in as little as five years. Not a problem for an ad or a poster or something, but a brand identity (even an imaginary one) should be distinctive and timeless. Even if you did the same concept but sketched your own type and scanned it, I think it could feel more unique.  But you've hit on a neat idea for the Rhino head/flame, and if you ever run across a company called Rhino, this could be a cool concept.  EDIT: others have suggested removing the weathered effect on all but the flame and I agree that would improve it, make it a little more unique, especially if that flame/rhino is an original creation, might as well showcase it!"

They probably, super likely, I can totally guarantee that they won't teach you everything in Photoshop - but that's because it's super, super, super extensive and it's the sort of thing that you learn best by doing. On the bright side, you'll be able to get a student-price subscription to Creative Cloud, so that is the bonus. I wouldn't know how, but I'm pretty sure you could find a copy of Photoshop CS6 online to start practicing on. Hell, even older versions still work pretty good.   Find work that you love and follow the artists/designers/whoever you're interested in. Read up their bios and read their FAQs and if you still have questions about how they do X, email them up and (politely) ask detailed questions that you couldn't have otherwise googled.   Look up tutorials and make work ""for fun"". Constantly try to impress yourself and have fun - that's when you learn the most because you're doing it without any pressure. Put time aside for it and have fun.   But seriously, just be really interested in learning it, doing it, seeing it, reading it... and it'll come. Good luck!"

graphic_design,3e1w1j,moreexclamationmarks,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:29:31 2015 UTC,"Photoshop is just one program, one tool. You'll also have Illustrator, and also InDesign (although, if you were going solely the web or app route, InDesign is likely less relevant, but it's integral for most print).   Your program should start you out at the beginning anyway, and any early projects you have should either be out of the software or requiring relatively simple/basic proficiency.   Photoshop on it's own is around $20/mo (although, if you're Australia I guess you're probably screwed on that since everything seems marked up there) but if you go monthly, it's a relatively small expense. I'd just make sure you can do basic exercises. Combine faces and photos (eg a fictional landscape, turn a person into a zombie or something), colourize a photo and ""repair"" a photo, put someone onto a different background, etc. If you already know how to do that kind of stuff, you should be fine for starting school.  There's ultimately just so much with all that software that you can't just learn it all in a month (or even a year if looking at September 2016), and you'll mostly just get more experienced by learning as you need to, where you'll have a project that requires something, or you'll have an idea that incorporates something, and you'll need to learn how to make it. Where you know there has to be a way, because across the Adobe Suite you can make anything, and so you'll find out how.   Beyond that, all the design fundamentals and everything should be taught to you. I went into a program with some basic/average software proficiency (I knew the above, had barely touched Illustrator, only used Pagemaker) and with a portfolio that had some pretty crappy stuff in it, got accepted to two design programs in my area. In year one, no one really knew anything. Typography isn't really intuitive and had to be taught, ideas were often crude and had to be refined. Software experience was rudimentary and had to be expanded.   That's why you're going to school for design after all, is to learn. Not just to get the piece of paper at the end."

Be straight like you've done here, and ask how you can optimize your art. They will help you, they want the business. If it's problematic, they will tell you. If it won't work, they will tell you. Keep all this between you and the printer.   Using this newfound relationship with the t-shirt printer, make yourself the printer liaison. Tell the vape shop guy you can arrange it all. Take a cost estimate from the printer and add 10%; that's your cut. Ask the vape shop guy what sizes he wants, and translate that to the printer, so all communication goes through you.

Asking questions like: What sketchbook is the best for designers, what backpack is the best for designers, etc.  I think it is normal to feel like you have to identify yourself with your job through certain items & behavior. I stopped trying to look for trends and the preferences and ideas of other people.   Instead, I now approach such questions in daily life as a designer it self. What problem do I have and what is the best solution for me to solve it now. (You will notice fast enough that there is no best way for anything to solve it).   In your case: What does your current IOS phone not have that you require, that an android system WILL have. How does that feature weigh in importance?   Identify what the problem is, what you need. Research both sides of the story (Android vs IOS) Find a way to put your research in such way that you can make a weigh-in. Sleep it over for a night or two. Make a decision and don't regret it.   In the end, IOS will have some pros compared to Android. Vice Versa can be said the same. Personally, I have a nexus 5 and I have never had the need to use a IOS for now.

But here's what stops me: Android fragmentation. Different carriers, different bloatware, different update scheduling. You really need 100% pure android to enjoy up to date Android usage and phone companies aren't interested in giving you that unless you're paying a premium price, like with the Nexus stuff. I mean, you have brand new phones shipping with older versions because companies don't want to upgrade certain things with their network. It's a little crazy.  In some cases it's just. That stuff helps subsidize the phones, so it is what it is. Just for me, I want day one updates and prefer not to do too much to do that.

A Samsung flagship device will get updates pretty quickly, and the S6/Edge support themes, so you can at least make it look like the latest version. HTC has been good with updating their flagships, too. Sony is my personal favorite though. My two year old Z Tablet was just updated to 5.1 and still runs beautifully. Whichever route you take, remember that sticking to flagships is best (don't get a weird mini or max version of a flagship), and that Nexus is the ultimate best device for updates."

graphic_design,3dvyja,OhEmGee01,3,Mon Jul 20 00:00:20 2015 UTC,"Hmmmm... this is a tricky one. The hierarchy of important information seems to be all over the place. The colors and typeface choices seem a bit dated, and the spacing of content does not seems to flow easily..Of course just the fact that it will be folded will help with some of the flow problems, but you need to think about the spatial relationships going on between the photos and the text. Try to align things to an invisible grid so that the reader doesn't have to search too hard to find the information they are looking for, or to find the next section that they are supposed to read. It may seem obvious to you since you are the one that created it, but the reader will have trouble. One of the bigger issues is the chart; it just seems too much like a Microsoft Word default chart instead of a thorough design. Try to lay it out in such a way that conveys the rows and columns, but maybe getting rid of the cell outlines. Again, color and hierarchy will be your friends, whether it be type size or boldness."
graphic_design,3dvyja,starting_overs,2,Mon Jul 20 03:24:26 2015 UTC,"Very well said, /u/starting_overs.  The things that come to mind immediately are:  The headline across all 3 columns is fairly poor form for a tri-fold, numerals where bullets would do, complete lack of grid structure (already mentioned), a clickable link for print purposes (???), and inconsistent use of background / negative space.  I'd say bring the (size) gap between headlines, subheads, and body copy closer together. Choose a typeface that reflects the generosity and camaraderie of the club better than Times. Something that tracks a little faster for easier reading. Georgia, maybe?  Might also do well to bring the logo back up to prominence and move the text off of it. As for a front photo, you'll never go wrong with the face of a happy kid or a really clean photo of the storefront.  If you have InDesign or Scribus (open-source), you'll be much happier than with Word, guaranteed.  Best of luck! Ask as many questions as you'd like, and be sure to post the result!

graphic_design,3dtula,jpjapers,8,Sun Jul 19 12:12:08 2015 UTC,"A lot of freelancers might not like this answer, but the agent should take a cut of your fee — not add a markup to it. After all, when I buy services such as printing or placing media, the vendor gives me a discount and I pocket the difference. I strongly believe the client should pay the same rate regardless of who they are going through — you shouldn't be in competition with your partner.  I charge $100/hr direct to the client and $80/hr wholesale. It is totally worth it because they are saving me lots of hassle and leaving me to focus on my work. This is when they are handling all client interaction. I'll pay a 5% finders fee if they are only bringing the client to me, or 10% if they are selling and securing the job for me. 20% is only when they are managing the project as well."

graphic_design,3du8nt,graphicdesigncult,3,Sun Jul 19 18:10:51 2015 UTC,"As with all portfolios, you should not be bringing a ""novel"" of work.  You should bring a ""magazine"".  In other words, bring only the best of the best, and leave behind the rest.  Your prospective employer doesn't need to see everything you've ever done.  They need to know that you've been working for quite some time (your resume tells them this), that you are capable of great work (5-10 of your best pieces will tell them this), and that you understand the best practices that drive that work.  If you spend sufficient time describing your process, including how each piece was designed and what went into it, you probably won't have time to show more than 5-10 of them anyway.  If they want more, that's what a web site and PDF/PowerPoint deck are for.  Plan your interview out.  Practice it.  Time yourself.  Describe each piece.  Invite a friend over for dinner and a beer and ask them to come up with questions about your work.  Time this as well.  See how long it takes, and then add in time for questions: both theirs about your background and yours about the organization in question.  If it goes longer than 1.5X the interview length, cut something.  Prioritize the rest.  Interviews often go over time, so have a little bit of extra content to show, but not too much.  If you do this, you look like you know what you're doing, and know how to plan ahead.  This looks good during an interview.  If you don't do this, you look like you don't know how to present.  A designer needs to know how to present.  This will give them confidence that you'll know how to present to their clients, and that you won't look completely overloaded and underprepared."

graphic_design,3dwhj9,sokkas-boomerang,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:07:15 2015 UTC,"In Illustrator, Open the scanned image, click on it, then use the Image trace tool, mess with sliders to get desired vector, then apply. Afterwards, select a white shape and click Select > Same Fill Color and then delete all the white shapes. Then you have the image you created, now in a one color vector.  If you want to entirely recreate this image as a vector using the pen tool then I would suggest using distort effects or different brushes / brush libraries."

graphic_design,3dwhj9,starting_overs,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:16:20 2015 UTC,"Correct. Although when I am using image trace, I usually open a new document and drag the image on to the artboard. Then I use image trace, remove the white shapes leftover after image trace, and then copy and paste the result into the document I was working on before. I treat Illustrator like a big messy table of ideas, very different than I treat photoshop.  Not exactly. It makes the lines you drew shapes instead of strokes. You might be able to select ""strokes"" and get that effect but I have never done that.    Try to look up different Image Trace tutorials and see if that can work for you.   To be honest, when I am trying to go for a hand drawn look, I will just repeatedly draw it and refine it until it's perfect, then just scan  it in really high resolution and image trace it."
graphic_design,3dwhj9,starting_overs,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:24:59 2015 UTC,Thanks for your responses.   And what's the difference between stroke and a shape? With a shape would I be able to resize and move it around?
graphic_design,3dwhj9,starting_overs,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:29:26 2015 UTC,A shape is a closed path with anchor points along it that determine it's shape. A stroke is kind of like an attribute that adds thickness to that path along the shape. Think of it as an outline that you can change the thickness and color.

If an employer wants to look at your personal facebook for some weird reason they'll look you up anyways. It's really just for people who have a facebook page for their brand."
graphic_design,3duy2c,paperskulk,2,Sun Jul 19 20:46:09 2015 UTC,Thanks for the feedback! Yeah I ended up only linking a twitter/linkedin in the end. Figured that it would look less professional to have a non work based fb account on it.
graphic_design,3duy2c,p0ndskum,3,Sun Jul 19 22:01:52 2015 UTC,I don't think FB is a professional account unless its an artists page dedicated to your work or services. The only social media accounts linked in your professional life should be dedicated to your work.

You'll be alright to use some self started fictional client projects in your portfolio while you build a good selection of real projects. Consider possibly contacting some smaller non profits in your area to see if they need help with anything and also check out /r/forhire there's a decent amount of small design jobs being posted there on a regular basis and I've picked up one myself in the past.

I have worked for the company for 10 months without a day off (except weekends)  The other thing is that he thinks we all should make unpaid overhours because we shouls be happy that he hired us. I stopped working later than 5 and he got upset with that.  And then there is our new coworker who was hired as a web designer who doesnt know shit just copy pasting other works and modifying free bootstrap. He gets praised for work but on the other hand he asks me EVERYTIME to help him for stuff he doesnt know, i stopped helping him because he doesnt say who helped him and with all the work and is now getting in trouble for being slower  Sorry for the typos, im writing from my phone"
graphic_design,3dqwqe,MVRH,23,Sun Jul 19 05:36:39 2015 UTC,Your portfolio should reflect the work you're capable of producing. I've seen a lot of young designers who shoot themselves in the foot by putting every real job in their portfolio even though it's not great. I had fake work in my portfolio for a couple of years. Go for it. Better good fake work than crappy real work.
graphic_design,3dqwqe,designgoddess,9,Sun Jul 19 07:55:54 2015 UTC,"Exactly. And if you think about it, it's not really fake work; it's work you've assigned to yourself."

graphic_design,3dqwqe,s3rila,5,Sat Jul 18 17:30:53 2015 UTC,"Part of my job is reviewing applicant portfolios. In my opinion, there is absolutely nothing wrong with putting 'fake work' for any real or fictitious company in your portfolio.   The reality of things is that as a professional, you don't always get to call the shots, or make the choices you know are best. Ideally, your portfolio should be a reflection of your skill and tastes, rather than those of your employers, so 'fake projects' are actually great for being able to show yourself off.  Only 2 notes:   Given your bosses stance on things, would probably not do any fake projects with the name or branding of your company, just to not make it feel like you found a 'loophole', which could piss people off and potentially burn a bridge there.  Secondly, just in terms of being transparent with future employers looking at your portfolio, I'd simply add the word ""Concept"" after the name of titles of the fake projects you'll be doing.  Good luck!"

The presentation of the projects is superb, combining both great 'in-world' shots as well as flat images. All images are big enough that I can appreciate the details. Briefs for each project are the perfect length, they don't go on for ever and ever, but still provide the essentials of each piece displayed.

graphic_design,3dqwqe,ImmortanJane,2,Sat Jul 18 17:32:16 2015 UTC,"it's pretty normal to have ""fake"" stuff in your portfolio. whether it's for class, a friend, a personal project, just a brief you gave yourself - there's nothing ""fake"" about it unless you pretend like it's real client work.  work history and portfolio can be the same thing, but they're usually separate things. who you have been employed by is one list, what you can do is another list. make it impressive and just indicate when something is for a paid client vs your own personal projects."

graphic_design,3dqwqe,phillip_fryman,1 point,Sat Jul 18 22:12:38 2015 UTC,"Pro Tip: Put the type of work in your portfolio you WANT to do, not what you have done, particularly if you don't like that work. Client choices are informed by what they see. Be it fake (let's call it concept) or otherwise, just be upfront about it if you are asked. And to make you feel a little better SO much ""award winning"" work people fawn over is often concept work that's too edgy for a client but gets run once in an obscure pub so it can technically qualify for awards. The Ad industry is almost as notorious as Hollywood for being a mutual backslapping society.  Also agree with several posters here. What's your bosses reasoning? Unless the work you created is top secret, proprietary and you signed something explicit like an NDA, I don't think your boss can forbid you from having it in your book, but better to ask a lawyer that or maybe reach out to AIGA and see if they know about the legality. To play it safe keep it off the web or place it in a hidden / password protected area if you think you need it to find new employment."

Hence the weird attempts at original designs like the infamous London 2012 logo.

Applicant cities aren't allowed to use the logo in their emblems."

I would imagine Olympic logo designs would need IOC approval, and that certain standards would be required.  Interesting tho, that a five-point star sould have different meanings...between the Soviet logo and the Los Angeles Olympic logo four years later.   Just to add an interesting side-note:  After the US boycott of the Moscow games over the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, and the USSR and it's ""Iron Curtain"" satellite nations' boycott of the LA Olympics in return, I had to give props to the one Soviet-bloc country that ignored the boycott and did send their team to the US games in 1984...Romania.  They got a standing ovation from the crowd during the ""Parade of Nations"" at the opening ceremonies."

This really comes down to breaking it down to them on a philosophical level. Why does s/he think it's boring? why does s/he think making it pop will raise brand identity? Why would more colors be a better fit for her/his brand?   A lot of this can be solved by designers stating their case why this is the most beneficial instead of asking 'What do you think?' to the client. It could also be not having enough trust that you can do a good job too.  But of course there's always belligerent clients that will voice their 'expertise' despite not being an expert.

graphic_design,3dmvdy,ChatGarou,2,Sun Jul 19 19:24:03 2015 UTC,"To put it bluntly, they don't handle licensing. They work the same way as someone like Youtube where they are not responsible for users uploading works using copyrighted materials. It is up to the copyright owner to hit Tee Public with takedown notices.  Although I don't think Tee Public is totally in the clear since they are constantly promoting nothing but copyright infringing designs. They can't really claim ignorance when they do that. Society 6 is a similar type site that is full of infringing work as well, but they don't blatantly promote it every chance they get."

Industry standardization is not something I had even thought about for the next version.  I was hoping I could edge out GIMP and Photoshop in terms of accessibility and usability for beginners.  Thanks for the straight talk.  I reached the conclusion before that it was impossible to break into the industry, but my ego can't help by want to finish this."
graphic_design,3do5iz,Zazenp,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:58:06 2015 UTC,"I never mean to discourage people from their projects, but the industry relies so heavily on standardization that it simply requires a large team of professionals and capital to edge out now a days. As far as beginners go, you could consider packaging your software into something that can be attached to an app or print system. Perhaps something that can be designed online and then sent to a local photo printer. Or take existing photos and edit them on a mobile device."

graphic_design,3dj3zg,MintChapstick,53,Thu Jul 16 18:05:21 2015 UTC,"Good read. I'm probably of two minds on this.  The first is that the lady is a complete asshole who finds the need to prod and bully people below her to make herself feel better or to rationalize her work day. Those people are poisonous and are clearly taking advantage of the situation.  The second is that you're out of your depth a bit. You don't need to tell people who Lucida fonts are unprofessional or sell her on why she should use Wordpress, even if you're right. You can lead a horse to water, but you can't make it drink, you know? You tell her and if she doesn't want it, then don't do it. Some people can't be talked to.  Overall, she's wasting her time and you're wasting yours. You're probably eager to do a good job with due diligence and all, but a lot of people out there are terrible and will bitch about $100 dollars for a banner when you really spent your time trying to be sysadmin, did a little advisement, and a bunch of other little things like deal with her bullshit.   Half the problem is youth, the other half is that she's a terrible person. I hope she uses that line about multi-million dollar companies with the next person who fixes her toilet or car and they politely tell her to go fist herself."
graphic_design,3dj3zg,MikeOfTheBeast,8,Thu Jul 16 18:36:49 2015 UTC,Thanks for your reply. I appreciate it. You're right about not being able to convince people. But then how do you work with people who don't consider your input when it's your job?  How should I politely tell her I do not want to work for her after all?
graphic_design,3dj3zg,MikeOfTheBeast,12,Thu Jul 16 19:04:46 2015 UTC,"Well, in a perfect world you work under someone who has your back and gives your decisions legitimacy until you have the work and experience to point out to someone like her you know what you're doing and she doesn't.  That said, you're always going to have people who don't respect what you do. You usually just take their money and make them happy if you can deal with them. At that point the job is just to get it done, and not so much anything else. There's no time for idealism with that sort of person.  I can't tell you what to do. Some people want/need to get paid more than others. Some have higher thresholds for tolerating people. Her idea that you delivered a banner in 3 hours for $100 is pretty disrespectful and far from the truth, but how willing do you want to deal for $100 bucks? People who work at a place like Starbucks may get paid that in 10 hours and deal with far more frustrating situations. That's just something you have to weigh."
graphic_design,3dj3zg,squidmanphilosopher,7,Thu Jul 16 19:32:49 2015 UTC,"I hate to break it to you, but dealing with completely tasteless and uninformed olds is about 75% of what a graphic design job entails. That being said, she seems like a real terror and I empathize with you immensely."
graphic_design,3dj3zg,nicetriangle,2,Fri Jul 17 00:33:47 2015 UTC,"Even younger, more hip clients that generally have decent taste still insist on bad design choices semi regularly. Half the design job description is dealing with that and not getting so hung up over it."
graphic_design,3dj3zg,DoandDesign,24,Fri Jul 17 18:29:18 2015 UTC,"Stop doing work for her. For your sake, for her sake, for the graphic design industries sake. She has an unrealistic view of what designers do, what they charge and what her role is.  If you want to be treated like a professional, price like a professional. Charge more, and surprisingly you'll get more respect.  Don't accept this because you think it's common behavior, I personally don't think it is. I give discounts to people who treat me nicely, and price very high for people who are assholes. Don't do it the other way around."
graphic_design,3dj3zg,9millaThrilla,2,Thu Jul 16 20:26:07 2015 UTC,"I fully agree. Make it worth your while to deal with shitty clients and in turn, they'll back off because the more of your time they waste, the more expensive it becomes for them. If they want to pay, you'll enjoy these projects more when you're making double on them."
graphic_design,3dj3zg,6745408,11,Fri Jul 17 12:48:31 2015 UTC,"If you have the knowledge and technical ability to back up your pricing, say that. She doesn't have to pay your travel.

graphic_design,3dj3zg,mikestearns,7,Thu Jul 16 23:30:17 2015 UTC,I think its a lesson we all learn at some point. There's no point in going through all the work to become a graphic designer if you're gonna do work you hate. Tell her to kick rocks.
graphic_design,3dj3zg,britchesss,4,Thu Jul 16 18:47:27 2015 UTC,"I agree and disagree with you.  I agree because it's shitty to make something that you don't love. Unfortunately, being picky about clients and only doing work that you really really like doesn't always pay the bills. There will always be instances where you just have to put on a smile, do the work, and get paid. If I prefer my version of a clients, I'll typically include the version I like in my portfolio. No need to showcase work I don't think is strong.  In regards to OPs client, I'd ditch her. You're a student and I'm assuming this would just be extra income, and this woman sounds like a bitch."
graphic_design,3dj3zg,mikestearns,2,Thu Jul 16 19:04:51 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah, definitely. We all take on ""this'll pay the cable bill"" gigs here and there. I probably could've worded that better."
graphic_design,3dj3zg,designgoddess,6,Thu Jul 16 19:16:16 2015 UTC,"I had a client tell me that when I paid the bill I could pick the design. He wasn't wrong. They are buying something from us. If it's something we don't want to do, don't. There is no better feeling than firing a bad client. It's like a weight lifted off your shoulders. On the other hand, if you need the money, you need the money. As you get more experience you'll not want those clients just because of the potential hit to your reputation. I had a client who ""designed"" the clover to a book we were doing for them. It was beyond awful. One day I go to their site and see it there with a design credit to me. Just about died. Had to make the awkward phone call about taking that down. She was so proud of the design that she thought she was doing me a favor. I told her it was unethical to take credit for for someone else's work.   Anyway, there will always be bad clients. You have to decide how much you're going to put up with. I will put up with more than I should if they are respectful to me. If you work hard and do good work most adults will take you seriously. This sounds like a client I'd cut loose."
graphic_design,3dj3zg,onederful,5,Thu Jul 16 23:27:30 2015 UTC,time to just bid her adieu. she clearly has no respect for you or your work. not worth the time gas effort and headache.
graphic_design,3dj3zg,JimmerUK,6,Thu Jul 16 18:55:35 2015 UTC,"Above and beyond what others have said...  Remember you're the expert, have the confidence and conviction to sound like one. Remind your client that you're the expert, they're hiring you for a reason. If they argue on price, that they've had better quotes, shake them by the hand and be on your way, they're not looking for a professional designer they're looking for an interpreter between them and Photoshop, it's not a good place to be.   Also, never work in front of someone. Personally, I hate it. Give me a brief and a deadline and I'll get it done. I don't do work in front of people, especially if they feel the need to voice their opinion every five minutes. People don't expect to be able to stand over a mechanic whilst he works on their car, telling him what bit to move and replace, etc, don't put up with it as a designer."

graphic_design,3dj3zg,ArjanVriezen,3,Fri Jul 17 01:49:37 2015 UTC,"If you feel like you're still compensated well enough for your time then I would suck it up and continue. If you're wasting time on dealing with her and not getting paid for it, then just cut it off.   These are exactly the people that should design their own businesscards with Vistaprint and make their own web banners in powerpoint. The output won't even be worse if they're already making all the design decisions. You can actually recommend that in a nice way and show the options.  My personal philosophy is to just be honest with them in a professional way. If your colaboration is not productive: stop working together."
graphic_design,3dj3zg,dlheidemann,3,Thu Jul 16 19:36:58 2015 UTC,"I feel your pain. I don't understand why graphic design is one of those things everyone seems to think they know everything about. I've been a full time designer for a few years at this point, and I'm ALWAYS working with people who somehow think they're an expert. It definitely gets old, but sooner than later you'll figure out how to work around these people in your own way.   Keep your chin up and try not to let it bug you too much. It's a colossal waste of your time at this point, yes, but sometimes you just have to cut your teeth on shitty projects.   You know what you suggested was the right thing and that's all that matters."
graphic_design,3dj3zg,f00gers,4,Thu Jul 16 20:50:44 2015 UTC,"Most of the problem is people view our industry as easy and if you have fun at a job, then it's not a real job therefore you shouldn't get paid for it.   Not to mention clients always want to go with what they want, not their target market. Due to the amount of teaching I have to do with my clients, I might as well get a education degree."
graphic_design,3dj3zg,dlheidemann,5,Thu Jul 16 21:19:24 2015 UTC,"That's exactly it.

I hope to someday transition into something like that, but right now what I have is good for me. I would explore the marketing departments of companies if you're not into the agency thing. Most of them have some sort of graphics role internally for creating sales presentations, trade show support, print materials, etc."

But you need to be sensitive to where she is coming from, and make sure that you shift the conversation when everything is cleared up.   You are providing a service, she is buying the final output. So to her she is nitpicking what you do because she thinks she's at build-a-bear. So there is a disconnect there that can be difficult to explain and to a CEO they tend to not care.  Where things tend to fall apart is very early on is that the client doesn't link the design to a specific objective. Everything needs to tie back to goals. Good design accomplishes a set goal, anything else matters very little. SO when you start any task, always ask what is trying to be accomplished by this. More clicks, more likes, a better understanding of where to go, more brand awareness, more brand consistency, etc. The more you can tie it to something hard and objective the better. Because then you can use that as your litmus test.   When you get / set a goal you move the conversation away from the creative and into something broader. This also will help give you a bit of room to push back. You can say, ""You hired me to accomplish this, and are judging me to achieve those results. I'm willing to put my expertise on the line to say that this will do a better job than what you are asking of me.""   Sometimes they give you the bullshit line that they are the boss and you will listen. Thats when you can fire them. You aren't an employee, you are someone who was hired for your skills. If they aren't appreciated you can move on.   Story: I was working with a client whose company was very successful, but the owner was the worse human I have ever dealt with. I did all of these things that I have said, but the CEO just wouldn't listen. In our third meeting where we were presenting logos he changed everything that we had based the designs off of. Essentially personality traits of the brand. I pulled up my notes and showed him and he told me that I didn't hit the parameters that we had set in the initial meetings. Basically that I didn't know what was masculine or feminine, or if something was literal or figurative, etc. I told him very clearly. I understand this is your company, I understand that you have an idea of what you want, but your company isn't represented solely by you. It is represented by the people you hire and the culture you have created. If there is something that you don't like we can adjust, but I am not going to allow you to tell me that I don't know how to do my job. I have been doing this for a long time and have had this meeting a hundred times with many many different people. I know how to make a brand fit its parameters.   He said, I was right, and we moved forward with the rest of the meeting. We didn't have a very good relationship to begin with, so other things still kept the project from getting finished but thats how it works sometimes.   I spoke on this whole topic at Creative Mornings if you are interested. I don't know how well the talk translated to video, but here it is...Telling your clients to fuck off without actually telling them to fuck off"

So she can see you using Lucida, but you really got more say in the choice?  Tell her you can hide SEO key words as white (or other invisible colour) text within the banner and that search engines will pick up on it, but you don't have to ruin the banner with more text. Find one of those shitty websites with the white text keywords that you find when highlighting, and ""prove it""  And, yes, stop working with her.

graphic_design,3dj3zg,arthurdodge,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:49:54 2015 UTC,"I think you are working with my former boss. She would always stand there and watch everything I did over my shoulder and dictate what I needed to do. Also she was a tremendous narcissistic dick. She in no way was an artist or designer, but she told the guy from the city who was painting the curb that she was a ""visual artist"" and she knew that the color he was painting the curb did NOT go with her house and he would have to change it by the time she got home from work.    Anyway, the thing you need to know about these people is that they view you as a tool.  You are not a designer to them, you are not even a person.  You are a smart mouse and keyboard that they can talk to because they don't know the mechanics of Photoshop and Illustrator.  Now it's up to you to decide if you are ok being the same as a hammer to help her build her terrible bookcase.  It's ok if you are, I was for 3 years."
graphic_design,3dj3zg,SoniCloud,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:10:41 2015 UTC,"Never work for her again, unless it's a problem of making rent and eating food currently. Always respond professionally but firmly, you don't want to validate her belief that you're immature, too young, or unprofessional. She should feel like she's the one badgering you inappropriately (though these people are generally incapable of feeling that way).  Are you working freelance or as a contractor? Or just an under-the-table quick job? If she hired you as a contractor, she can't tell you where or how to do your work, such as at her office with her hovering over you. Explain calmly why the cost was what it is (ie man-hours and develpment).  Sometimes the best course of action, when you're so angry and bewildered you don't know what to say, is to not say anything. Just a response to acknowledge her message, address her complaints without opening it up for debate, and not much else. I hope she's not refusing payment too?  Also, sometimes it's easier to just give them what they want if they're pig-headed about it. Smart clients will trust that they hired you as a specialist, not an Adobe monkey. Ideally you will finish school and be able to discard the shit, aka the client thinking they know better than you even though they hired you to do something they can't."

graphic_design,3dmsn9,MikeOfTheBeast,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:46:59 2015 UTC,"I would say that the best place to begin would be to analyze the designs and determine what the commonalities are between them. These will establish an idea of the visual conventions and constraints used to determine the visual style, along with creating unity between the individual pieces.  From a quick look over, I would say that there is a strong emphasis on shape, the simplification of form, and the prominence of shadow.   When you set off to copy a style, you really have to take the time to think about it, to analyze it, to get as strong of an understanding as you can on the decision making that takes place when creating that style of work. If you possess a solid technical ability you can achieve almost any style. When making something very deliberately, the style is in the decision making."

But, before you do this, a big fundamental thing to understand is the ""why"" for this.  If you are considering design as an escape from your mundane current job, I'd say that this is a very typical thought process for people. Remember though that the grass isn't always greener.   Not trying to deter you, but just being realistic here that our field isn't one that's based off of technical skill, but rather talent. Like yes, you can go to school to ""learn"" design, but that doesn't mean you'll get a job in it. Look at this sub, there's a lot of people who did everything they were supposed to but are still unemployed.  If you do have the drive and the passion, you might succeed. This isn't a field you do because it's ""interesting"". For a lot of us, we have wanted to do this since we were kids. We then went to school for it and are constantly living it. These guys and girls have a head start on you, and when you position yourself as a designer, these are the ones who you will be fighting against to get jobs.   Combine this with not only the current crop of students, but the fact that everyone who knows how to use Photoshop is now suddenly a ""designer"", and this now means there's a lot of people who want to do this work, but not as many jobs to give to everyone.  I'm not trying to scare you, I just want to be realistic. Basically, you're getting into a field that has a lot of talented people who are currently doing amazing work. They are successful not because of their degrees or their technical skills, but because of a combination of them being fully dedicated to the craft and also natural talent.  There's a very good chance you will dedicate a significant portion of your learning to end up not being able to get a job, because there's just another applicant who's better than you, no matter how hard you work. If you are up to this challenge, then I wish you the best of luck!"

Two shapes (say a blue and a red ones on a white background) might be touching each other tightly but rasterizer which turns your shapes into screen pixels only processes one shape at a time.   So rasterizer takes a blue one on a white background and turns it into pixels; on the edge these pixels are half-blue, half-white. It does the same for the red shape, now producing half-red, half-white pixels on the edge. When these shapes are finally put on screen, the border between them will look like a thin white-ish line.  Of course if the border is aligned exactly to pixel grid, this thin line won't appear.  For hi-res images it shouldn't matter because the line will be so thin it won't be noticeable. But if you prepare a low-res image for screen, you have two options:   make the background below your shapes similar in brightness and tone to the foreground shapes; use trapping   Both methods essentially replace touching shapes with overlapping ones."

We used to use die cut lettering for refelctive street signs and the like...and if you go back far enough in time for other kinds of signage as well, but most of the lettering these days is contour cut vinyl.  AFAIK, a die cut is like a cookie cutter. For signage it's a stainless steel ribbon blade pressed into a wooden block, that is in turn mounted into one of many many types of letter press. A substrate is placed underneath and then the blade is brought down onto the sheet of substrate to cut out the letter.  With a countour cut, a computer driven router traces a poly shape onto a sheet/roll of adhesive backed viny with a small blade. After, the extraneous material can be pulled away leaving behind only the relevant letters or shapes.  I own two plotters for cutting and printing on vinyl. I use them from everything from full on vehicle graphics and wraps, to small and large real estate signs, right down to the smallest little decals, for every kind of use under the sun, and then some."

graphic_design,3dk1sx,justanotherdesigner,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:59:38 2015 UTC,I go through hundreds of resumes and I can't remember a single one where I was impressed but I can remember quite a few that sucked.   So you get OK resumes and bad resumes? None that knock your socks off?
graphic_design,3dk1sx,thisdesignup,3,Fri Jul 17 03:58:46 2015 UTC,"When we were looking for designers we always looked at the portfolios first, if they were any good we would then look at their resumes.  The resumes that ""knocked my socks off"" were based on exquisite typography, which is usually a sign of a mature design sensibility.  Fancy resumes impress HR people, not the designers who will be making hiring decisions."
graphic_design,3dk1sx,DoandDesign,1 point,Fri Jul 17 12:02:19 2015 UTC,"I don't really consider the OK resumes in a visual sense because I am just looking for their past experience to see if they've worked consistently, for any recognizable places, and if they jump around from job to job frequently.  I don't work in a print layout setting so I don't really care if you can put together a flashy resume. i look at the portfolio first so by the time I get to the resume (or if I do) I already have an understanding of your skill set. Making it loud seems desperate and inexperienced in my opinion. But either way, even with a terrible resume I wouldn't pass on a designer if their portfolio was good just because their resume was bad."

From my best guess I would say that the base images were made in Photoshop/Illustrator, and then implemented through HTML/CSS. Since I can't see what the transitions are like, they're either straight coded CSS transitions, or CSS controlled via JavaScript and jQuery selectors.  Since it appears that you are just starting off within this realm, I would recommend you search and explore more in the area of Front End Development/Design. The same skill sets will be addressed, but the application of those skills will be more practical, if not simply more tasteful."

Note: This will not work if your vector illustration is super complex and has thousands of vertices. Also this is a hack, it works, but sometimes can create weird affects, however it works better than creating raster graphics of things like logos and it works better then converting into .wmfs.  edited to add, if you need the graphic in excell or powerpoint, drag into word like before and then drag from word into the other microsoft programs."

I wouldn't be surprised if their legal team decided this warrants a C&D. If those elements are to be used in a prominent way, there would definitely be copyright issues."
graphic_design,3dfxfy,tuckedfexas,22,Thu Jul 16 00:58:10 2015 UTC,"The V in RVCA is actually a U.  The brand is pronounced ""Roo-kah"", like Veruca Salt from Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.  Most people don't know this because this it is an example of poor graphic design/marketing"
graphic_design,3dfxfy,eatcitrus,17,Thu Jul 16 03:48:01 2015 UTC,"Ruca roughly meaning clothes in Latin, hence the V instead of U."
graphic_design,3dfxfy,mcmb211,6,Thu Jul 16 04:10:51 2015 UTC,"Most people don't know this because this it is an example of poor graphic design/marketing   This is true, however I feel it's helped the brand. I don't know if there's a term for this style of ""in the know"" advertising, but I've always felt it helps underground brands retain some of their identity as they grow. It almost helps newcomers feel hip, like they're in on the joke, or part of the clique. There also might be science behind this technique, as we often tend to remember curious images longer, as our brains spend more time trying to figure them out.  The most popular form of this exclusivity can be found across the nation in cryptic bumper stickers, urban artwork, and graffiti (which might be the oldest one). Only runners are supposed to ""get"" the ubiquitous 26.2 ovals or stoners might be the only ones who understand dancing bears. I feel this is part of the success of the OBEY brand as well."
graphic_design,3dfxfy,saucercrab,3,Thu Jul 16 13:15:04 2015 UTC,I'd give RVCA a pass. It's quite similar in concept even to Strava with the whole up and down thing.

graphic_design,3dfxfy,rockthemike712,1 point,Thu Jul 16 07:45:41 2015 UTC,Fun fact: the VA part of the Vaio logo actually represents analog soundwaves. The IO represents digital. I think the name actually came from the logo idea.

The first one was a contract position that ended up lasting 3 months. It really depends on the relationship you can build up with the recruiters. If you have a good portfolio, have a decent personality and can communicate well, then they will probably do the best they can to get you work.   Keep in mind, this place is only making money when you do, so they are doing the best they can to get their clients into paying positions. If you aren't hearing back or nothing is materializing from them putting you in front of jobs, then you probably aren't what they are looking for.   To specifically answer your question, no, they are not as bad as the internet would lead you to believe. But it all depends on what kind of person you are and how good of a designer you are.

It's for a publication that is focusing a on spouses of military members. So it can be any photo of any person. I have explained why using a photo just because it has Bob or Sally in it is a bad idea. To no avail, she wants what she wants.  My responses are tactful, of course, but I am pretty steadfast that she is not going to cross that boundary of sitting over my shoulder telling me what to click and where to move things.  I've tried to find canned responses too, which handle the issue, but there isn't much that works for me. We'll see how this next email goes, but is it wrong of me to not want her to sit with me while I do her bidding as a surrogate designer? At that point I just feel like a tool with no backbone.

It's not really a great career for someone who doesn't especially love the work because the job market is very competitive, the average salaries are not all that high, and many of the jobs out there are not the super creative, glamorous design jobs I think many people might imagine them to be.  You sound like you're just casually interested in design. I would recommend going to a community college and getting your core classes (maths, sciences, english, etc) out of the way where they will be easier and cheaper than a 4 year school and then transferring to a bachelor's program at a 4 year school once you've had some time to do more research and think about what you really want to do. A lot of people half-heartedly enter design programs and find themselves abandoning the major (or after they graduate, the career) and that's just a waste of time and effort."

graphic_design,3djj5x,Voxelflux,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:55:44 2015 UTC,"Not bad, good composition but has some spacing issues, style inconsistencies and sloppy linework.  The swirls themselves and the width of the line leading to the swirls needs to be consistent all-around. The width of the line should decrease when nearing the end of the swirl but it varies from shape to shape and looks a bit rough around the edges. You can mitigate this with the smooth tool in Illustrator.  Some elements are too close, you should either connect them entirely or seperate them further and keep the spacing equal-ish among all elements.  There are too many curved shapes with a lot of gaps between them, reducing the amount of the shapes while increasing their length will make the design less busy and well connected. Currently some parts of the design looks like tribal tattoos instead of art noveau.  I would also remove the white circles from the water-drop like shapes as it makes the top part of the border seem like an angry bearded fellow.

Buying a new sketch book feels good, which makes it a nice reward once you fill it up. You just have to make sure you have that self control to wait until you fill it up.  I, too, keep a lot of written notes and scribbles in my sketch book. What I do to keep myself from having to look at it all when I open my book is this. I work from the back to the front, but only open it from the front. I know I'll get to my most recent stuff first, and I avoid the pressure of having to make the initial sketches good, or getting caught up in old work by accident."

Sometime you completely forget what you've done and its just a surprise to see it again. I've even tried to go back into half filled books and use blank pages.   The thing is now, I've kind of grown out of the sketchbook and just use sheets of paper. It's easier to manipulate on a flat surface and takes up less room.

graphic_design,3dftwc,skim-milk,7,Wed Jul 15 22:58:45 2015 UTC,"Because of my job I have a lot of background in this area. Any idea what print engine they are using? All the file tips in the world won't make a crappy print engine do well. But file problems can affect your output a lot too so.... Based on what I'm reading you should send the same job to a couple printers and compare their proofs and start there. Calibrating your monitor is a good idea for any designer.  What kind of paper are they printing on? Digital prints look far better on smooth coated stocks. Digital printing lacks the roller pressure of lithographic printing so porous/uncoated papers won't hold density very well. Textured paper is also harder to image because it doesn't conduct the transfer charge as well.   Dots and rosettes should become indiscernible to the eye at about 150 LPI which is 1800 DPI in a classic halftone dot pattern. Your average mid level copier is printing at 1200x1200 or maybe even 1200x600 so we're talking about an equivalent 133 LPI. Better RIPs like the EFI Fiery use tricks like FM screening (stochastic) or emulated DPI to help, but the achieved quality is still not quite like the same image printed with a metal platemaker for offset printing.  Still have 'dotty' print and color drift? The printer might not be calibrating often enough or their OPC drums might be old. GRACoL is the most commonly used profile for digital sheetfed printing so there shouldn't be any trouble there. Creating your design in CMYK from the beginning should prevent any shifts from conversion. If you run quantity, compare several sheets from different parts of the stack to see if the color is changing on the fly. Ask your printer what color profile they use as a standard, they should be able to answer that for you. If they don't have an answer I would question if color accuracy is their focus. Many printers focus on lowest price :)  Color is such a deep topic that you really should read, practice and ask your way to a better understanding.  In classic printing, metal plates take 3 minutes to image in a high end screen platemaker. CMYK is four color channels, so it takes 12 minutes to image. In digital printing, the engine is projecting all 4 of those ""plates"" for EVERY sheet that goes through, all in the blink of an eye. This is why lithographic printing is still regarded is the pinnacle of image quality and for now that's still true. High end presses like the HP Indigo series and some of top japanese models are sort of coming close.   Designing in vector should eliminate resolution concerns coming from the file, so long as you're not flattening or rasterizing that element, it sounds like you're good here. This is especially important with gradients. Careful with fine lines below 0.25 point, they can dither away at digital printing resolutions. Using the ""high quality print"" PDF preset out of indesign should include everything you need and faithfully pass your vector artwork to the rip as vector data.  I have absolutely no idea if I've answered your questions lol but hopefully this helps. I've written all kinds of articles on these topics so I'd be happy to share some if you'd like."
graphic_design,3dftwc,hou5ton,1 point,Thu Jul 16 00:11:40 2015 UTC,"No idea what print engine either printer uses. I will be sure to ask next time I need to print something. How do I know what is ""good"" and what is ""bad""?  The last two jobs I did were, I believe, on smooth coated stocks. I just printed a postcard with a smooth aqueous soft touch coating, and before that I printed another postcard on ""satin"" coated paper. I'm guessing the soft touch coating isn't considered a smooth coated stock because I was more annoyed with color/dottyness on that than on the cards I printed on smooth coated paper.  How could I ask them about what LPI they're printing at, ask them if they can use a higher LPI, find out about print engines, etc without sounding like I'm randomly using buzzwords I read online? Is this something I even can request? Can I ask them how often they calibrate their printers? I don't want to annoy them by inadvertently coming off as someone who thinks they know a lot but clearly knows nothing. I used to work in IT and those types of customers always annoyed me a lot.  I wasn't happy with any of the local print shops I tried in the last city I lived in, but I recently moved and found a place near me that has great reviews and looks like they might be worth a try. Their website says they use an HP Indigo for small runs and a Heidelberg Quickmaster DI for large runs.   My biggest issue is cost, since I'm doing such small runs (most jobs I do are 35-50, I've done a couple of jobs of up to 100 pieces, but that's rare). The places with the higher quality presses charge substantially more than the places I've been using... I asked for quotes from printers in town on my last job and got quotes ranging from $150-200 for 100 5x7 cards, while overnightprints.com priced out to something like $60 including shipping. I know the higher priced places will probably do better work, but I do a lot of invitations for weddings, showers, etc and if I want to keep my prices competitive with those stupid zazzle/minted/whatever sites, using the $200 place means I might not get paid for my design/labor on a job, while printing with overnightprints or smartpress allows me to get more than just barely breaking even.  I really appreciate your informative comment, thanks for taking the time to write all of this out. I would love to read some of the articles you have written! I really want to learn more about this, I hate that I'm so uninformed about something that is so incredibly important to my job."

This is because of FM screening and eDPI. LPI is no longer a fair measurement but to be honest DPI isn't either. When stacking up all these tricks you're just down to perceived quality. Maybe ask them for samples of jobs from that machine that they're proud of.  Paper is something to check but if it's not the problem it's not the problem.

I'm not sure what machines you've been running but I assume most new machines have new features which allows you to print on uncoated and textured stocks much better. Using the 800 with a Freeflow RIP (after using FreeFlow I've realized EFI Fiery is garbage) allows me to manually change the roller pressure and fuser temperature. I've printed solids on  13"" x 19"" sheets of Classic Crest Stipple Cover in a room with 20% RH and achieved amazing results.

A good digital printer should be able to work with you and bump up ink levels to try to achieve the results you want - most good machines should be able to achieve cymk matching pretty well.  But basically, talk to your printer and find out what equipment they use and how they like their files handled. Going for the cheapest printer you can find is also probably an issue."
graphic_design,3dftwc,Dave_robb,3,Thu Jul 16 00:13:17 2015 UTC,"I work for a large format print shop. So I might be able to help you solve some common problem that I see.   Are you printing digitally or offset? Digital prints tend to lack the ""pop"" offset presses have and that may be a reason why your work isn't up to your standards. For the shop I work at we request any Digital prints be at-least 600 dpi/ppi this will help solve some of the dot pattern/ circle spots you are seeing. Coating on the paper plays a HUGE role on how the a print will come out. Some coatings are shitty and when printed on look blotchy and spotted. If you can, request samples of different stocks. For color, if possible always ask for a full color proof. Also if its possible on your end, use some sort of color matching system, wether it be pantone or any other system your printer uses.  Ask your printer when the last time their engine was calibrated, from personal experience our digital press starts to shift towards magenta after about 10,000 clicks. Be weary of what paper/stock you use for your print. This often times goes overlooked and it can actually shift the color of you print. Some stocks have a slight warm tone, some have a cool tone. This inadvertently shift the colors of your print."

I do a lot of invitations, announcements, etc. Do you have any suggestions for compensating for that lack of ""pop""? Should I take my Illustrator files into Photoshop and bump the contrast/saturation up a little or something like that?  Most of my work is vector illustration and text, should I be converting this to a high-resolution raster file? I generally send them PDFs created in Illustrator.  I know I should be getting physical proofs, but since all of my jobs are very low quantity (35-100), and I haven't been using local print shops, I've been opting to just go for a soft digital proof since the printers I have been using charge $25+ for a single proof and that's sometimes half of the cost of the print job. Generally I just do as much color matching as I can and then send the file out and hope for the best. I know this is horrible, but at least when I have a job where great color/quality is an ABSOLUTE MUST (wedding invitations, for example), I do go for the physical printed proof.

graphic_design,3dftwc,Seposita,1 point,Thu Jul 16 04:19:11 2015 UTC,"Lots of great advice already in this thread. Heres a bit i can add as a designer (and NOT a printing expert): pick colors that print well! Some colors are too bright and saturated to transition well to CMYK. If something needs to be very bright in a process color, sticking to one or two plates should produce a more brilliant result. Stacking colors on top of each other can quickly lead to a result that is darker than you are expecting. This is especially true for solid blocks of color.   Usually, if your having trouble making things ""Pop"" the problem can be in color selection rather than printing. Colors are not looked at in a vaccum - every color on a piece is judged in comparision to the other colors it is next to on a piece. A strong foundation is a must for any designer!  Heres a random resource I love for print design: http://www.underconsideration.com/fpo/ Never hurts to study what is working well.  Also, paper stock quality has a large effect on the quality of CMYK prints.  Hope this helps, Best of luck!"
graphic_design,3dftwc,hou5ton,0,Thu Jul 16 21:18:54 2015 UTC,"Been in printing for over 25 years so I'm going to keep it simple. Make sure you convert all of your colors to CMYK so you can see exactly how they will print. Any image over 300 dpi is overkill. Make sure RGB images are also converted to CMYK.  Make sure you flatten your transparencies. Use the SWOP color profile. When you make your PDF's make sure they are set to print/press quality. Most pastels will look like crap on on any color copier. I hope you don't take this wrong but you are doing like 50 copies and a lot of printers aren't going to bend over backwards for you the same as the ad agency that is paying $10,000 + for a huge offset job with spot colors that must match."

This solves most of the color/ translucency issues but small copy and details may be too thin to back with white. In these cases you want to use darker colors that are printed with less translucent inks or figure out a way to integrate a white halo into your design.

A year or so isn't that long. To get as good as others you need to practice a lot. There is no trick to getting good, it really is just the art of practicing. You have to create a lot and make those fixes when you notice that you could do something better, never slack on work. That is how you improve.  Also there will always be someone better than you. Just make sure, in the moment, you are doing your best. That is all that matters.    i am pretty sure i have no 'eye' for design nor good taste, yes i can recognize crappy design, but i don't even know why i have the right to call it crappy. i judge it based on its looks (e.g. the kudawara pharmacy logo incident)   Next time you see something that looks bad, take a moment and look inside yourself. Figure out why you think something looks bad; is it the color, are things to close together, is it hard to read or look at, are shapes well? Consistently analyze and then ask yourself ""why"". If you let yourself judge based off of looks then you won't understand your own thoughts. Slow down when judging a piece of design and figure out why you have your opinions."

You don't just show up on day one, get thrown a glove and told to play left field for the first game of the year.  And as long as you're learning those fundamentals, the rest will come. With design, a lot of it is about finding a groove, and also realizing that your first idea or your first version will almost always suck. Going through revisions, getting critiques and feedback are integral to the design process. Even if you're on your own and have no one to bounce ideas off of, do not just come up with a version and run with it.   In my program, courses were generally about 3 months (we had no exams save for design history or research type lecture courses), where maybe you have 3-4 projects ranging from 2-5 weeks from assignment to due date, depending on whether it was more of an exercise or a full-on project. Each class would be 4 hours. You'd go in, there'd maybe be a 10-30 min lecture or lesson, then everyone would go to work while the prof would meet one-on-one with each student and review what they'd done over the last week and give feedback. (When done, you could keep working in the labs for the rest of the 4 hours, or take off.)  With the 4-5 week projects, the first week you might bring in thumbnails, research and basic concepts and goals of what you were thinking and where you wanted to end up. Second week you might now be onto comps or first version of mock-ups. Around this time, you either realize your idea is solid or maybe you have to go back a step as something isn't working, or maybe you had a eureka moment and realized a different direction is just better. This would get refined for week 3-4 depending, and then the homestretch to week 4-5.    Point here is that those revisions and refinements really matter. If you just tried to do a project in 20% of the time, it's hard to properly get that perspective. I mean almost anything you'll ever do, if you looked at weeks or months or years later, you'd see ways it could've been improved. Trying to do something in a week will rarely be as good as something with time to mature and reflect on it, even if over 3-4 weeks instead of one, or to do in 1-2 days instead of over a week.   And of course, along this path you're seeing everyone else's work too, at least to some degree. And that can help push you or inspire you. But every time, no matter what, you'd get to that final week when people are showing their work and there'd always be a person or few that would just blow you away, because they thought of things you hadn't considered. And eventually, this wears off on you. Because on that next project, you remember that awesome work someone else did, and it prompts you to think of things in a different way. Not to emulate them, but to find that inner spark in yourself. You start noticing things elsewhere and around you as ideas for a project. You realize you had walls up around yourself and now you're breaking them down, and it frees up creativity you didn't think you had, and those great ideas come out. And then that time happens, where when everyone shows their work, you actually feel--without a hint of hubris--that finally you were the one with the work that everyone else looked at and thought ""Wow, now I need to up my game."""

Maybe the 5 minutes after you finished it...until you see this, and that, and this..etc that could be improved.   Design is a process of learning, you'll never stop learning because it evolves continuously and you will see other designers creating better content because of that. So thats why you need to keep yourself up to date.  ALSO This video!! :  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1oZhEIrer4&  Really got me when I saw it."
graphic_design,3dfdws,TLGwegg,4,Wed Jul 15 20:59:48 2015 UTC,"I doubt it, considering there aren't many shops I know of that have enough designers to make collective bargaining worth anything (with some exceptions I'm sure). I'd imagine being in a union with a larger communications department would probably be a more common bet."

graphic_design,3dfdws,Zazenp,3,Wed Jul 15 21:11:54 2015 UTC,"Further down the link, someone makes some very good points. Unionization is designed to protect laborers that are highly replaceable with other identically trained people. Sometimes this is for a specific trade but usually it's designed for collective bargaining power within a company. Artistic design is not the same thing. You can't expect two designers to make an identical product. Therein lies the problem. You want your wages standardized with someone vastly inferior to your talents? It sounds like it'll ""level"" the playing field but in reality it will grossly devalue the art in graphic design. We'd have to standardize our output to be worth our standardized wages. That would simply suck all art right out of the job. I'm not sure you understand the purpose of a union. But perhaps you're thinking more along the lines of a guild."
graphic_design,3dfdws,moreexclamationmarks,1 point,Thu Jul 16 00:43:57 2015 UTC,"I'm not even sure at this point how a guild could be utilized. Where whether with a guild, or something like a certification or accreditation, it's only effective if widely adopted and 'enforced.'  If there was a graphic designers guild, for example, what would stop someone from hiring some non-member designer, whether as a freelancer or in-house? The industry and profession is not all studios and agencies, and I'd imagine those are the only types of places where there'd be any sense of enforcement, and where non-member studios would be blacklisted (but would still likely have no issue getting clients).  As for unions, it seems often people are very polarized on them but while they have their uses, they are often poorly run or run like corporations themselves, and either replicate many of the same problems or have their own problems. They're anything but ideal."
graphic_design,3dfdws,Zazenp,1 point,Fri Jul 17 13:43:34 2015 UTC,"You're not wrong in any sense.  I'm just offering that as I didn't think OP really understood the purpose of unions since s/he thought that a bricklayers union is in any way comparable to a graphic design union.  A guild would be closer to what would be feasible but it would be utterly impotent.  Still, if it focused more on laying out some ground rules that we could point to in terms of reasonable expectations in both price and procedure, instead of attempting enforcement, it could still do some good."
graphic_design,3dfdws,moreexclamationmarks,2,Sat Jul 18 14:21:53 2015 UTC,"I definitely agree, but realistically I'd fear is just too late. A guild for designers would've been far easier to implement decades ago relative to today, where layouts, typesetting etc were less accessible and more highly skilled. There was far less of a hobbyist or amateur element given how less accessible the tools and procedures were prior to ""desktop"" computer based design.   With the saturation of thr market and the accessibility of the tools, there would be a lot of time, effort and money required to get a guild to where it'd need to be."

graphic_design,3dfdws,moreexclamationmarks,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:31:55 2015 UTC,"I'd assume a lot of that is more in the pre press, production or low-end graphic design positions.   I don't at all understand how you could have anything beyond that in terms of designers in a union format. Imagine where a creative director is not determined based on ability but purely seniority. The difference between a creative director, senior designer or a junior is not purely experience by seniority. You can't swap out a creative director with a junior or intermediate and get the same outcome."
graphic_design,3dfdws,spellitcorrectly,1 point,Fri Jul 17 13:50:43 2015 UTC,"My bill paying job has a union that I'm heavily involved in which got me thinking about this for my graphic design work.    From what could I find, there's guilds and associations but no unions (especially in the U.S.).   But I'd be down to join one as a freelancer. Check out r/labor because someone did ask about how to start/join a union and got some good answers."
graphic_design,3dfdws,thisdesignup,2,Wed Jul 15 21:34:28 2015 UTC,But I'd be down to join one as a freelancer.   What would be the point of a union as a freelancer? Don't freelancers work solo and get to decide their own working conditions and wages? I wonder if a union might remove the freelance aspect of freelancing.
graphic_design,3dfdws,spellitcorrectly,1 point,Thu Jul 16 09:35:26 2015 UTC,Maybe a guild then? Are actors and other jobs in the Hollywood industry not technically freelancers and don't they belong to guilds to set industry standards? At least that's my understanding of how it works but I couldn't totally be wrong.
graphic_design,3dfdws,moreexclamationmarks,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:33:57 2015 UTC,"They are, with set minimum pricing and such, but they're also large enough to enforce rules, where an actor not a member in SAG cannot work, for example. The issue there is it becomes technically a kind of extortion, where you're required to pay dues and join SAG in order to work as an actor, whether you agree with it's policies and directions or not, whether you'd be fine on your own or not, you have no choice. You additionally have scenarios like with the Writers' Guild strike a few years back."
