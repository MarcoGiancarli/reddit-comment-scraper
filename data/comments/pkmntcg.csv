pkmntcg,3e5w5a,vittorsm,2,Wed Jul 22 04:59:43 2015 UTC,"Medicham with the ancient trait. With a muscle band and strong energy you're hitting 140, which KOs basically any non EX   Edit: Use Shrine of memories as your stadium, and you can hit for 120 for a single energy since you'll be able to use meditites attack. Baby landorus is a good pair in the deck to get back energies from the discard and power up medichams on the bench."
pkmntcg,3e5w5a,YahMoBeThere1,1 point,Wed Jul 22 05:29:35 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the help! I have created the following list, please rate it:  Pokemons  2x Meditite  2x Medicham  2x Landorus  2x Machamp  2x Machoke  3x Machop  3x Mienfoo  2x Mienshao   Trainers  3x Energy Switch  2x Evosoda  4x Roller Skates  4x Switch  3x Muscle Band  4x Korrina  2x Pokemon Center Lady  4x Professor Sycamore  2x Professor's Letter  2x Shrine of Memories   Energy:  12x Fighter Energy"
pkmntcg,3e5w5a,JauntyAngle,1 point,Wed Jul 22 05:53:47 2015 UTC,"Not bad, can use some fine tuning. Here's the Medichamp list I prepared a while back:  https://www.reddit.com/r/ptcgo/comments/3bu8x3/building_a_fighting_deck_for_free/"
pkmntcg,3e5w5a,Hukutus,1 point,Wed Jul 22 06:37:21 2015 UTC,I'd drop the Mienshao line and make the Medicham a 4-4 line. Also you should play 4 Strong Energy.
pkmntcg,3e5w5a,Kakakakarot,2,Wed Jul 22 07:35:20 2015 UTC,"Donphan is probably the best option, but it's rotating out of standard in september unless your decides to go with expanded format. Consider Landorus since it can hit the ground running while powering up your attackers. You can also try Medicham since it has an ancient trait that lets it attack twice, effectively hitting for 70 damage twice. That core will likely be your safest and most consistent deck if Donphan is not an option.  You said that you liked Machamp, so if you're feeling hella risky, you can try to do a Maxie and Machamp combo to supplement your attackers. Basically, you throw Machamp in the discard and burn through cards in your hand so you can use Maxie. Then you can put Machamp straight on the bench without needing to evolve it from anything It'll make a great support pokemon since it gives +20 damage to your fighting types. And it'll use up less space in your deck since you won't need the Machop or Machoke lines. I'd only suggest doing that if you're struggling for additional damage and also get comfortable using the deck."
pkmntcg,3e5w5a,Hukutus,1 point,Wed Jul 22 05:38:54 2015 UTC,Non-EX variation doesn't work that well once people get their hands on the better decks.  Decks to consider: * Raichu/Sky Field * Medicham (With Ancient Trait) * Plasma Weavile * Donphan * Wobbuffet/Crobat/Miltank * Shiftry/Giant Plant Forest when AO is released
pkmntcg,3e5f6c,skidooelan,3,Wed Jul 22 02:27:22 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't recommend it. The packs you see in dollar stores (I am guessing Dollarama in Canada, thus all of the following prices are CAD) are usually repackaged cards from a third party, meaning they take 5 random cards (mostly commons and sometimes uncommons, rarely anything else) and reseal them for distribution. They are certainly legal cards, but don't expect anything good out of them.  Official packs come with 5 commons, 3 uncommons, 1 reverse-holo of any rarity, and 1 guaranteed rare or above in each pack. They also come with a PMTCG Online code that you can use to redeem the pack for online play.  The best place to start if you don't how to play is to get a theme deck ($13). Now they aren't good at all in terms of being competitive, but they should help in you understanding the rules of the game, and gets you a bunch of cards to start. Once you get it hammered down, you can move onto getting an Elite Trainer Box ($40) from the recent sets. This contains 8 packs from the set, a bunch of useful things like dices and tokens, sleeves, and a stack of basic energies that you can use for future decks.  In the long run, it's always more economical to buy single cards either from card stores or online. If you like opening packs, booster boxes ($120) give the best bang for your buck with 36 packs."
pkmntcg,3e5f6c,mouselmm,2,Wed Jul 22 03:13:41 2015 UTC,"Dollar stores do actually carry official three card packs that have at least one card above common, and you can get FAs and EXs in them. There are YouTube videos of openings and it seems like the chances of getting something good are almost the same as buying a regular pack of 10 cards for $4 and you are getting 12 cards for the same amount.   Still not a good way to start playing, but fun if you like to open a bunch of packs. These don't have codes for the online game either."
pkmntcg,3e5f6c,funny-original-name,2,Wed Jul 22 05:10:49 2015 UTC,Those packs sold in Dollar Tree are actually not too bad.  Canada got these instead :/ https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemon/comments/nb2vt/check_out_what_you_can_get_at_dollarama_now/

pkmntcg,3e5f6c,funny-original-name,1 point,Wed Jul 22 06:11:47 2015 UTC,I don't understand. What's stopping you from buying the packs?
pkmntcg,3e5f6c,The_Shreckoning,1 point,Wed Jul 22 03:04:37 2015 UTC,"Usually, if you want to get started right away, you really do need to get a starter deck. In most TCGs starter decks are kinda iffy and don't really do much - most the time you'd be better building your own deck. But in Pokemon TCG they're pretty important. This is mostly because they provide a decent amount of Energy.  If you don't already know the rules of PKMNTCG, Energy is used as a resource to power just about every attack in the game. It's kinda like Mana. While there are some decks that can go without Energy altogether, they're typically difficult to make or play for a newcomer.  The issue is that most standard booster packs - much less third party - don't contain much Energy - if any at all. At most you might get one as a bonus card. And there aren't any ""Energy boosters"", either - you either buy starter decks or get them from another player directly, and depending on what kind of deck you want to try, certain energy types are harder to come across, and Energy is a bit pricey in general (as compared to MTG's resources).  Not to mention, many decks focus less on pokemon and primarily on Trainers - no matter how many pokemon you have in your deck, if your opponent wins 6 prizes (i.e, 6 of your pokemon faint), or your bench is empty, you're out! It's hard to get started playing a 40 card deck, then, that has a proper Pokemon-Trainer-Energy ratio when you're new and just using cards you've bought.  Top that off with the possibility of those cards bought from the dollar store being way outside legal rotation, and you've got a frustrating equation.  So in short, you'd need to at least by some 8 packs there and you'd probably have a bad deck that may or may not even be playable, legally or mechanically. So, yes, you can start with that, but it's better to start by just picking up a starter deck, or, better yet, trying to see about buying used decks/cards online.   In fact, here's an example of some of the stuff you can get online for the cheap. That's just a single example, you should shop around a bit, but you'll probably be able to find much better deals with legal/much better cards that way than just buying a few random cards in a dollar store."
pkmntcg,3e2mau,JauntyAngle,4,Tue Jul 21 14:04:36 2015 UTC,Why is Manectric Tier 3? I don't think it is. Someone reached top 8 in US Nationals Masters Division with Manectric.

pkmntcg,3e2mau,Rakkis157,3,Tue Jul 21 21:46:57 2015 UTC,"About Pyroar, there is some speculation that, due to the card being a Stage 1 which grants it multityping, and Grass being a lot more common, might be a little more viable. Now that Claydol and Banette are also around, it may see a little play. Unlikely, but imo still worth noting."
pkmntcg,3e2mau,greekars22,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:23:20 2015 UTC,"Yeah, worth noting. But I think it wouldn't be enough to get a pure Pyroar deck up to tier three. I can see a 2-2 or maybe even a 1-1 line seeing some play. Maybe in Vespiquen?"
pkmntcg,3e2mau,cellojake,2,Tue Jul 21 14:45:06 2015 UTC,"I still think pyroar will see play as tech in a fire based deck. A turn 1 pyroar can buy you so much time depending on your opponents draws. The other pyroar (lysandre ability) is actually a great counter to mega ray metal decks since you can snipe bronzongs/shaymins (even with the pyroar itself) and thus weaken the mega ray attack. A pure pyroar deck simply doesn't work anymore imo. I'm currently only running 3 pyroars (2 xy, 1 PF) in a charizard EX deck and it works quite well."
pkmntcg,3e2mau,Azaqurah,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:05:49 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I love me some Flare Command Pyroar. I think it's actually quite a bit better than Intimidating Mane Pyroar these days. Lysandre at will is brutal."
pkmntcg,3e2mau,aqlno,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:11:20 2015 UTC,Exactly. I think pyroar will see play as a tech.
pkmntcg,3e2mau,Azaqurah,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:16:25 2015 UTC,"I see the grass hitting hard after the meta settles. The fact that both primal are weak to it as is toad could make it really popular. That being said, the prevelance of megas and the buzz surrounding a stage 2 resurgence due to weakened toad could very well make pyroar obsolete."
pkmntcg,3e2mau,GSUmbreon,3,Tue Jul 21 15:13:46 2015 UTC,"I think standard format will be super interesting in the upcoming season. Especially with only a relatively small pool of cards available to us once 5 sets swap into expanded!   Hopefully all of the space in the meta will allow less ""competitive"" decks to shine for a few tourneys.   Also looking forward to all of the new stuff coming with Ancient Origins. Looks to be a great set to lead rotation with."
pkmntcg,3e2mau,Azaqurah,2,Tue Jul 21 16:54:45 2015 UTC,"Reading this solidifies my decision to start buying for metal ray. If bronzie is a tier 1 atm with its rotation disadvantage made up for by a tier 2 (colorless ray) with no rotation hits, I'm sold. Really helpful post÷"
pkmntcg,3e2mau,GSUmbreon,2,Tue Jul 21 18:42:27 2015 UTC,"Some comments:  Metal: I've been playing a fair amount of Metal without Keldeo-EX, and I think the deck is still fine. The focus is less on Dialga-EX/Heatran and more on Aegislash-EX. The loss of Cobalion-EX does hurt, but most of the time it was used as an answer to Suicune and Pyroar (although it needed a Muscle Band to get over Pyroar). Suicune is rotating out, but Pyroar will still be a problem. Granted, fire decks lose Reshiram, I doubt we'll be seeing it much anyway.  Night March: The loss of Mew-EX is huge here. Vespiquen variants will replace Flareon variants, but she's a little too fragile to be a true focus. I actually think the best variant of Night March moving forward will rely on Gourgeist and Shrine of Memories, which is a little slower but more resilient. It will be forced to go Grass/Psychic either way. The nice thing about that type combination is that it can tech Giratina-EX if it wants to and get away with it.  Yveltal: Dark loses a lot of support with the rotation, because Darkrai-EX will be gone. However, baby Yveltal remains one of the only sources of Dark support left, so we'll likely see the Yveltal deck reborn as a Tyranitar variant.  Fighting: The loss of Landorus-EX definitely hurts. But I think that as long as Korrina exists, Fighting decks will always work. Lucario-EX hits the ground running if you get a Strong Energy on it early."
pkmntcg,3e2mau,cellojake,2,Tue Jul 21 19:08:02 2015 UTC,"THANK YOU for bringing up Lucario! I've been buying singles for a lucario deck post rotation (not hit much by rotation actually) and all I see people talking about iS Landorus! I agree completely that Lucario can get a quick start.

pkmntcg,3e4mz2,cormano_sanchez,4,Tue Jul 21 22:39:06 2015 UTC,"Each player has a POP ID that has up to seven or eight digits. Every time you play at a tournament or a league, you give your POP ID and it all gets taken care of online automatically.  Play! Points aren't really relevant until Nationals comes around; you need 10 Play Points to play at Nationals! Other than that though, having more Play Points can win you cool rewards like holo energy cards mailed to your home if you choose to opt in to that.  There are League Challenges (LCs), Cities, States, Regionals, Nationals, and Worlds. You can show up to any of these tournaments as a brand new player and have a great time! Nationals has the aforementioned Play! Point requirement, and Worlds is an exclusive, invite-only event to the top players every season. This is where Championship points come in: if you have over 300 points (at least for the last season this was true), you get invited to the World Championships!  Play Points --> get you into Nationals Championship Points --> get you into Worlds.  The kicker is how many people you need to get those points. If you get top four at an LC, that earns you ten points. You only get those points though if the kicker is fulfilled e.g. if eight people showed up. If six or seven people show up, then you don't get points for getting fourth!  Let me know if you have any questions or if you want me to clarify something!"

pkmntcg,3e3rku,mateo1time,2,Tue Jul 21 18:58:53 2015 UTC,"At a glance, first pass at where I'd start (and no AOR, I'm still focused on Worlds so haven't really devoted time to the new cards)  -2 Malamar EX  -3 Professor's Letter  -1 Trainer's Mail  -1 Fan Club  -2 Trick Coin  -4 Dark Energy  +2 Pikachu XY  +2 Raichu XY  +1 Vulpix PRC  +1 Ninetales PRC  (maybe 2-2)  +2 Professor Sycamore  +4 Ultra Ball  +1 Shadow Circle    Reasoning:  Cut Malamar back to 1.  Sleep is fun, but you really can't afford to use Malamar as a primary attacker. As an end of game clean up, yes.  Also why you drop the Trick Coins. 2-2 Raichu gives you a secondary attacker that can clean up or set up Yveltal.  The 1-1 Ninetales is to try to lock Shadow Circle in place.  Cutting energy and letters, but with draw support and 13 energy you should still be hitting it, even better with baby Yveltal fishing it of the discard after an Ultra Ball.    This deck will miss Darkrai EX's free retreat, but if you can use your switches and ropes after a Y Cyclone moving DCE to a Raichu or fresh Yveltal on the bench, you should wreck face.  Focus on baby Yveltal + muscle band early and use Raichu to take knockouts when you can and swing the prize trade in your favor.  All that said, I'm not sure of Yveltal's place in the new meta yet -- and Raichu and M Manectric likely aren't going anywhere -- but try some changes and see how it goes."

pkmntcg,3e0wt3,Azaqurah,4,Tue Jul 21 12:51:34 2015 UTC,"To everyone complaining about Expanded, MTG has already proven, using its very similar Modern format, that the format is not whatever you claim it to be. Standard will continue on as it always has, being the ""leading"" format for the game. Expanded opens up the competitive realm of possibilities through an expanded card pool, which helps the competitive scene stay fresh by having multiple ""top-decks"" across multiple formats, instead of only hearing about X deck in the only viable format just steamrolling everything. This can also, if not ruined by player speculation and other extraneous bullshit, help drive prices for some cards down to affordable levels, and possibly push other cards that were once worthless to prices that people can accept to get rid of them for because they'll be viable in a different format. Expanded will also allow some players that cannot afford to always stay in step with Standard to continue to play at organized events, instead of driving them away from the game because they simply can't afford to play the only-existing-format anymore. As cellojake said, has anyone considered that the events for this next season may run Expanded instead of Standard because the Standard rotation just started? Give everyone a league season (5-week period) to get adjusted and start going in; Top decks aren't always created first thing, day one of the format in which they are a part of."
pkmntcg,3e0wt3,boomwikity,3,Tue Jul 21 10:20:51 2015 UTC,"If anything, this is more like Extended in MtG, and what happened to that? The Modern cardpool is massive, and Expanded is nowhere near Modern's pool. Many of the same decks that were good this season in Standard will be good in Expanded as well, and many staples will still be used to create a more stale format. I do agree that as more sets are released, it will get better and better as long as there are no rotations for the life of Expanded. That would make it more like Modern and less like Extended. However, it is more difficult for Pokemon as there is no side board, so it will be very difficult, if not impossible, to prepare for every deck you might see. This is always the case with every standard rotation, with very few exceptions, and none in recent years. We always start with few sets at the beginning, but regionals don't start until 6 months or so after the rotation, do they not? The point of the smaller tournaments like locals, cities, etc. closer to the rotation date is to determine those top decks, so there are no excuses come regionals."
pkmntcg,3e0wt3,Alebot,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:56:39 2015 UTC,"Obviously the Expanded format will be Standard+ for the time being, since there are so few sets, like Extended, but it will move to be more ""Modern""-like, like you said. I misinterpreted OP's ""regional"" to mean ""locals, cities, etc..."" (as in, in the region) and not actual Regional Tournaments. That's an error on my part. My error also stems from OP's use of ""season,"" which I took to mean league season, or 5-weeks, not the 2015-16 season. For that, you're right. The point of locals, cities, etc... IS to determine how to play in the new format in the lead-up to larger events."

pkmntcg,3e0wt3,TheChildOfKreis,2,Tue Jul 21 16:55:05 2015 UTC,"The only thing I don't like about Expanded is that it's not very kind to players who started playing the game after many of the ""good"" cards went out of print. Max Potion is pretty expensive for an uncommon, then again so is VS Seeker which is still in print. It's not a huge problem since the cards usually aren't that expensive anyway, but it's a minor annoyance. The nice thing about rotation is that it tends to drive down demand for older cards and thus lower their price.  I do have one question though: is Tropical Beach banned in our Expanded format? It was banned in Japanese tournaments at the same time as Lysandre's Trump Card."

pkmntcg,3e0wt3,cellojake,-2,Tue Jul 21 19:58:11 2015 UTC,How does it promote creativity? We already know the best decks and combos.
pkmntcg,3e0wt3,cellojake,4,Tue Jul 21 02:47:10 2015 UTC,"So everyone knew about Wailord going into nationals?  It promotes creativity doubling the card pool and letting players create unique combinations that no one has ever thought of before.  Sure, some combos and pairing are obvious like Exeggutor and Vileplume, but what about others like Wailord?  We don't know the best decks and combos. There will always be those handful of decks that do well but with so many cards to pick from, ANY deck has the potential to beat those powerful ones.   Seismitoad, Sceptile, Big Basics, Raquaza. All good decks. But Wailord? A total surprise due to the unique cards it ran and the exploitation of the game rules.   Expanded promotes creativity and innovation."

Now pokemon changes all the time which means that the standard format makes sense, but with the recent sets from black and white to now and how little the game has changed (hp and damage) then it makes sense for them to have this ""expanded format"" as the main format for big tournaments. Hopefully next season, every event will be expanded."

But if you're have some money to invest, I'd recommend going for a booster box and then picking up the rest of the singles you'll need. Opening up a box is super fun and definitely worth the money if you can spare it."
pkmntcg,3e0nnf,aqlno,2,Tue Jul 21 03:06:36 2015 UTC,"Buying singles is almost always the cheapest option. If you want all the staples though, buying a box isn't a bad way to go. It's more fun that way anyways. I don't recommend the theme decks, you could probably buy every good card in them for a couple bucks as singles."
pkmntcg,3e0nnf,Sixjester,2,Tue Jul 21 02:11:26 2015 UTC,I have to vote for the box as well. Theme decks arent really worth the money if you're looking to play competitively. Boxes are insanely fun to open and usually at least come close to paying for themselves. I usually buy a box then get singles as needed.
pkmntcg,3e0nnf,Azaqurah,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:26:36 2015 UTC,I'd get the booster box first then see which theme deck to get for the staples or what I'd do is buy the singles because I feel that would be cheaper then buying them from theme decks.
pkmntcg,3e073h,bhaji,2,Mon Jul 20 23:11:11 2015 UTC,"N is a good card to use at the beginning of the match because you essentially get a free new hand, it is also good to deprive opponents of cards late game too.  Sycamore/Juniper is a reliable card at any point in the game but you lose any remaining cards in your hand to the discard pile.  Colress is a great card late game and really benefits from people using sky field but is pretty much useless the first few rounds.  Shauna/Professor Birchs Observations are consistently reliable and allow you to shuffle the other cards in your hand back into your deck, the downside is that the cards you get are more limited in number.  Cheren/Tierno allows you to draw 3 more cards without losing anything in your hand but again it is only 3 cards, so it is risk/reward as to play this or use a different draw supporter  I believe we will be seeing a lot more Professor Birchs Observations/Shauna as N and Colress go out of rotation in September as they will be one of the only ways to get a new hand without discarding.  Hope that helps!"
pkmntcg,3e073h,JonnyMohawk,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:44:08 2015 UTC,"Like Jonny said well above, sycamore is risk reward. You may spend a lot of good resources to get a new hand.   In the new ""N-less"" format, I personally think Tierno may have a chance. If a control-style deck comes out and you can just build an enormous hand size (sort of like what wailord ex does) it could see play. Only ace trainer and red card could reset it, and if they are not popular tierno might see a meta inclusion."
pkmntcg,3e073h,cellojake,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:51:00 2015 UTC,"At a non-Expanded tournament, Shauna, Birch and even Ace Trainer may be superior options to Tierno. Look, if you want to use a draw Supporter, get a new hand. Or if you just want to draw cards, use Acro Bike or Trainers' Mail."

This could leave room for you to utilize other supporters like Flare Grunt, Lysandre or Xerosic"
pkmntcg,3e073h,Azaqurah,-1,Tue Jul 21 01:36:09 2015 UTC,"In Regionals this year, you can use cards from Black & White-on since they'll use the Expanded format for the whole tournament. Don't be so happy about the Kalos Starter-On format."
pkmntcg,3e054v,VSSeekerthrowaway,10,Mon Jul 20 22:55:57 2015 UTC,"Golden cards like that are called secret rare item cards and that one you got is one of the best in the tcg right now. Secret rare items are basically reprinted cards from a previous set (in this case Phantom Forces) that are extremely rare and, as I'm sure you saw, crazy expensive. VS seeker is a prominent card seen in pretty much every deck so it's secret rare version is sort of a flashy card that people put in decks as a status symbol.

Their value depends on how much their normal version is used in competitive play (except Charizard, which is valuable regardless of how bad the card is). This is one of the reasons why the secret rare Ultra Ball is worth 90 dollars, and the secret rare Energy Switch (also from Roaring Skies) is only worth six dollars. I've noticed that the secret rare VS Seeker seems to be going down in value, although I'm not sure why."

Forgive me, but I just can't find a more 'elegant' way to say this. You don't know anything about what we 'Original Players' played.  I've been playing since Base Set (sort of, started in Jungle) and I can tell you one thing. The NXD on era to before Megas started to make a scene is the closest the tcg has ever been to the original tcg, where the majority of viable decks are big basics with the exception being Blastoise (who even then made use of Articuno) and Do the Wave (current incarnation being Raichu and/or Mega Ray Colorless). Haymaker, the most common deck of the time, was a deck built around big basics that do tons of damage for little energy and had high hp. Sound familiar?  Thank god the internet was nowhere as encompassing back then as it is today. Otherwise, the game would have nearly no variety. Only difference between then and now was that the Trainers were no longer OP, and the big basics better balanced."
pkmntcg,3e2355,Rakkis157,5,Tue Jul 21 12:20:07 2015 UTC,"You don't know anything about what we 'Original Players' played.   That's the perfect wa to say it. I feel too many people get frustrated with losing and start blaming EXs because they can't afford them or whatever. EXs aren't the problem.  Nor are ""OP"" Trainers. In fact the trainers like Crushing Hammer are nerfed versions of old Trainers.  I started playing since D&P and it was all evolutions. I remember Machamp from Stormfront punished Basics by knocking them out instantly! Rare Candy was so good you could use it on your first turn or the turn a Pokemon was first put into play! Those were the days.  And yes I've read and heard that in the older days, big Basics dominated the game. People who want evolutions to rule don't know what the game was like originally. Modern EXs are soo cool. The artwork and their attacks. Hydreigon EX's normal art looks so awesome the graphics, shading and lighting are perfect."

They're still going to play the best possible decks, regardless of what type of pokemon are in them.  You aren't going to suddenly be better at the game because there aren't EX pokemon in standard"
pkmntcg,3e2355,hiltzy85,4,Tue Jul 21 14:25:38 2015 UTC,"Considering OP is only 12 I don't think he is around during the time of Base Set. The metagame has always been about efficiency: the most amount of damage for little energy, with sturdy HP and easy deployment. EXs are no more dominating than other metadecks used to be, with a bunch of Scythers, Electabuzzs, Hitmonchans, and later Sneasel running around.  Plus, without EXs, M-evolution will simply impossible to be competitively viable if tacked onto a Stage 2. Even with Basic-EXs, we really didn't see an increase in MEGA play until the release of spirit links, support cards, and general increase in MEGA power."
pkmntcg,3e2355,mouselmm,2,Tue Jul 21 14:26:43 2015 UTC,Overall the reason MEGAs see play is because of spirit links. You can see it as the cards without spirit link do not see much if at all play.
pkmntcg,3e2355,cellojake,3,Tue Jul 21 15:45:55 2015 UTC,"I would enjoy a EX Free Set or even a block! Because i think that would whip the Standard Players right in the butt!   Aaaaargh.  It's not about EXs and non-EXs. It is about the best cards and the worst cards. In a TCG, they print very few of the best cards, a few good cards, and a tonne of the worst cards. The most dedicated and experienced players play with all of the best cards that they need. New players don't have any of the best cards. They play for a while... they get the best cards.  It's nothing to do with EXs and non-EXs. It is the fundamental mechanics of TCGs. If there were no EXs there would be amazing basics, or amazing ultra rare stage 2s, or amazing trainers. And the guys who are currently beating you would have decks full of them. And you would not have many of them. And whatever the other amazing card was, you and 1000000 other new players would be complaining about it being OP. Until you had enough of them yourself."

pkmntcg,3e03h8,galaspark,2,Mon Jul 20 22:43:36 2015 UTC,"Mewtwo-ex was expensive because it came out right before a major tournament and any deck that did not run it was sunk. I believe it was 100$ plus for a copy before (i think regional or states??) Anyways, the card over centralized the meta. A tin did come out though which helped. Shaymin has not reached that price yet because of when it came out, and the decks in play. While all decks can run one, it was not a requirement to have a chance. Like I said above, it did not come out within moments of a major, so there was time to collect it. M2 took a while to stabalize after the initial spike.   My prediction is shaymin-ex will climb in price after worlds, and the FA will climb higher if a tin eventually has one (or its reprinted.) All the major players have gotten their shaymins, and once worlds is over people returning to the tcg will need one.   Also to answer the question about seis/mega ray ect. These cards are not, ""run one of these or you auto lose"" cards. At the time m2 was that way. If they had a m2 and you had no m2 to counter it, you were sunk.    The easiest way to see (i do not have this stat) is how many FAs/SR/UR you get per box. I do not think it has changed."

pkmntcg,3dypyc,asdjklghty,2,Mon Jul 20 21:17:41 2015 UTC,"There is no substitute that is anywhere near so effective. Metagross is not the answer because steel decks are really cramped already.  Basically, you will have to play steel in a very different way.    No free switch No charging up whatever attacker you think needs to be charged No streaming of Full Metal Impact, or even Heatran's Steam Blast   It will be more about getting something up front that can stall or otherwise be useful, and using Bronzong to charge stuff up so that they are ready. There is more likelihood that you will send something up and it will attack until it is done for. You will use Full Metal Impact for finishing the game, taking out the opponent's only credible attacker, or as a panic measure. Obviously you can switch or manually retreat, so it isn't like the playstyle is gone completely. But it something you will get to use every now and then rather than continually."
pkmntcg,3dypyc,JauntyAngle,1 point,Tue Jul 21 07:07:14 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'm a bit baffled with the loss of Keldeo EX as well especially with decks that make use of Bronzong. Sadly, I think the best alternative at the moment is lots of switches/escape ropes, and a few float stones to attach to Bronzong so you can switch into them, and then retreat them to bring out your new Active Pokemon."

pkmntcg,3dypyc,Rakkis157,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:48:31 2015 UTC,Hell I might have preferred btp because at least it would give other decks a chance to accelerate. Not sure of the ruling on it but was it only once per turn per player? If so that's still less broken IMHO than letting people go straight to vileplume turn 1. Gpf + vileplume is gonna be really annoying. The sceptile decks are almost sure to run this.
pkmntcg,3dypyc,Azaqurah,2,Tue Jul 21 12:53:19 2015 UTC,"IIRC the only difference between Giant Plant Forest and Broken Time Space is that the former only affects Grass, and the latter affects everything. I took a fairly long break from the end of FRLG and started again at around Furious Fists, so I could be wrong.  That said, with EXs around, Broken Time Space just might be balanced today. I fear Bats though, especially with Porygon Z in Bandit Ring."

I am curious about z bats. It looks like a good idea but it is heavily dependent on rare candy, and it's begging to get picked off after one or two uses. Seems like a lot of work for relatively little damage and essentially giving up a prize."
pkmntcg,3dypyc,Azaqurah,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:27:43 2015 UTC,"I agree that it does not seem to strong. The deck with Bats and/or Daunts WITH Broken Time Space however is a force to reckon with.

If decks like ttar become popular it will be good as you will discard so many resources.    Rule of thumb: if you rely on them not having a tool ( for whatever reason) the you need one. If ttar is destroying you you might need one (especially if you can hit for weKness) if the answers to these questions are no. Either use xerosic or don't use any."
pkmntcg,3dy7me,Choczy,2,Mon Jul 20 14:38:07 2015 UTC,"Your question really depends on what deck you are playing and what your strategy is.  With the cards you listed, I'd start Yveltal as my active pokemon and put energy there to build up my primary attacker. I think the best way to get a feel for the game is to watch good players.  On YouTube, check out the channels TeamFishKnuckles, The Top Cut, and mikeptpcgo, among others.  They all will show you a deck, explain why they built the deck like they did, and then paly a couple games with it and explain their thought process while playing.  That will really help you develop a feel for why they make the moves they do.  That's really helped me determine when I want to put something on my bench versus when I'm better off leaving the card in my hand.  I used to just want to get as much on the field as I could, now I'm a lot more selective about when I play a card."
pkmntcg,3dy7me,sodamnhappy,2,Mon Jul 20 15:20:02 2015 UTC,"Your question is very specific to your deck, and I think you got some good answers here. Are you at all familiar with other card games?   In truth, the overarching strategy across almost all card games is actually quite similar despite very different mechanics.    Take a quick look at this: https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/3dsy4f/a_competitive_hearthstone_guide_for_casual_players/  This was a post over the weekend for Hearthstone.  It's very specific to that game, but the concepts outlined here have been talked about many a time, and apply to most card games.    There's a couple of key things to think about approaching each play:    1) What is your deck meant to do?  (ie. Are you playing a fast deck meant to ramp up in damage by T2?  T3?  Do you want to take fast prizes?  Do you need to set up for an invincible combo?)  Always know this going into a game and assessing every situation, because you need to know your own win condition.    2) Who has the board control/advantage?  Are you proactive or reactive at the current point?  What can you or your opponent possibly to do reverse the situation?  This is something that comes with more play, but I notice a lot of players think only about themselves, whereas the top players think not just about their opponent, but several turns ahead of them.  After all, you're playing against a thinking opponent who has the same goal as you.  Try to see what they're doing, and think about how you can defeat that.    To use one of your examples about whether to put down certain Pokemon.  Do you need to put all those Pokemon on the bench?  Do they provide value to you on the bench, or is it more useful to keep in hand as a possible bluff?  Is it a problem if Lysandre comes out and they get KOed for a prize, or to help your opponent stall because you can't afford to retreat?  Does it easily reveal what you can do so your opponent gets more time to plan?   Another example would be the question of energy distribution in your edit.  It really depends on both your win condition and your opponent's board.  Does rushing damage on Yveltal put you at an advantage?  How many prizes can you take with the strong early damage?  Does that put your opponent at a huge disadvantage in terms of needing to give up prizes to muster a return KO?  How many turns does it give you to set up?  On the other hand, does your opponent have something that can return a KO?  Would you win a trade with them as Yveltal?  Does Zoroark offer more prize potential than Yveltal now?  2 turns later?  These types of questions are highly dependent on game state and what resources you have available vs your opponents.    Pokemon is quite different to a lot of popular competitive games because it's a heavily draw-reliant game, where card draw is extremely accessible and it's not at all uncommon for players to go through their 60 card deck within a few turns.  As you get into deck building, remember that consistency is key and you want to make a deck that can do the same thing in the first 3 or 4 turns every game at least 50% of the time (which is a pretty low standard)."
pkmntcg,3dy7me,fushida,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:13:15 2015 UTC,I assume you have the tcgo code. I would just go online and practice. The easiest way (and why you don't see many articles) to learn the game is playing it more and more.
pkmntcg,3dy7me,cellojake,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:17:50 2015 UTC,"Generally you want to start with a Pokemon you can start attacking asap and can take a hit or two or, use one as a wall while you set up on the bench.  For your Yveltal deck, Yveltal is the best starter. On your first turn, you should be able to discard a darkness energy or two and then use Oblivion Wing when you can to power up an attacker. Like Yveltal EX or just about anything."
pkmntcg,3dy7me,asdjklghty,2,Mon Jul 20 15:18:21 2015 UTC,"The Yveltal deck has two Sycamore and two Ultra Ball. It's not very easy to discard energy, especially on the first turn."
pkmntcg,3dy7me,Sixjester,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:33:59 2015 UTC,"If you get some more Sycamore and Ultra Ball this shouldn't be too difficult to do. You can find Sycamore in XY or XY Phantom Forces, and Ultra Ball in XY Flash Fire or XY Roaring Skies. When you open a pack, take a close look at the symbol in the lower-right corner of the cards in the pack (it should be next to the collection number.) This is the ""set symbol"" and appears on every card that can be found in that pack. Even the cards in theme decks have those same symbols."
pkmntcg,3dy7me,galaspark,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:50:52 2015 UTC,"Adding consistency cards would make any theme deck way better, sure, but that wouldn't be fair for the person playing the fairy deck."

pkmntcg,3dy7me,YahMoBeThere1,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:00:51 2015 UTC,"When deciding whom to attach Energy to, remember that Energy can be discarded by your opponent's Item cards (such as Crushing Hammer, Enhanced Hammer, etc.). Same with tools and Startling Megaphone. I always assume that my opponent has an Enhanced Hammer in their hand at all times when I play. So basically, you should avoid playing Special Energy unless you can attack with that Pokemon during the turn you play it. There are some exceptions to that, especially with high-energy attacks, where you have to play energy every turn to be able to attack as soon as possible.  Tools are a little different. When attaching tools to a Pokemon-EX, I think it's best to attach tools immediately. That way, your opponent can't attach a Head Ringer or Jamming Net and cripple your Pokemon. If you want to give a tool to a non-EX, you should wait until that tool will actually have any kind of effect. If you leave a tool just sitting there, your opponent can play Startling Megaphone and discard your tools all at once.  One other thing I should mention is using attacks that let you search your deck for things and put them in your hand. I don't recommend relying on these, at least not until rotation. The card ""N"" is one of the best Supporters in the game, and it makes both players shuffle their hands into their decks and then draw a card for every Prize Card still on that player's side of the table. So if you used Zorua's Nasty Plot to search your deck for a card, your opponent could play N and put it back in the deck before you even get to play it! When N rotates in September, attacks like these will probably become more usable, unless Red Card grows in popularity."

Regarding decks:   Google budget pokemon decks or take a look at past winners http://www.pokeplayer.com/topdecks/standard/  If you want to go rogue, look at pokebeach. It should have list of cards for each set. I would build from the latest sets- roaring skies or ancient origins. Building from the latest sets will prevent you from losing a lot og catds to rotation.  Use sites like coolstuffinc or troll & toad to buy the cards for your deck.

pkmntcg,3dw0ea,aqlno,2,Mon Jul 20 02:16:11 2015 UTC,"There are frequent events that happen which are larger then a local league meetup.   Here is the level of sanctioned events going from smallest to biggest: League Challenge, Cities, States, Regionals, Nationals Worlds.   We're at the end of the 2014-2015 season with only Worlds left, going from Aug 21-23.   The first big events of the 2015-16 season will be autumn regionals. Regionals are usually played in many different areas across the country over multiple weekends. Many competitive players will play in as many regional championships as they can.   Next is city championships from November to January.   After that is winter regionals in February.   Then state championships in April.   Then spring Regionals in May   Finally Nationals in July and Worlds in August!   Throughout the entire season league challenges will occur on frequent occasion. They're much more casual than any of the other premier events considering they're on an extremely local scale.   I hope this helps explain the competitive season of the Pokemon TCG.

I've been doing lots of research to see what kind of decks i'd be interested in playing and the M-Groudon/Wobbuffet deck has caught my eye.  One thing I don't really quite know though is what decks aren't going to be losing much come rotation.
pkmntcg,3dw0ea,RocketGruntD20,1 point,Mon Jul 20 06:48:07 2015 UTC,"Groudon doesn't lose very much at all. Like everything else it loses access to some good supporters, but being a Fighting deck arguably its best supporter remains in place. It loses the scramble switch ACE SPEC, which makes me sad. but overall it gets off light.   People will need to run 1-2 weakness policy, though, I think, as grass is going to be everywhere in the next format."

Many other decks are losing a lot from what i've seen so that was a draw of the groudon deck because it retains key cards such as Korrina and whatnot.

In fact, the cards that are expensive are usually fancy full art cards, which have a cheap ""normal"" version.

If you search for code card bundles and do some smart trading you can have a decent deck in no time. Experimenting with decks on ptcgo are what lead me to buy real cards for leagues,which we are just starting to get into. As others have said, get cards from newer sets to make sure they last longer. We can't be sure how the meta will settle till after september, so this is a really good time to just try out some decks online and see for yourself which newer cards are seeing a lot of play.

pkmntcg,3dwrom,asdjklghty,1 point,Mon Jul 20 12:38:44 2015 UTC,"There's still the Gourgeist variant that uses Shrine of Memories to use Night March after it evolves. You lose Dimension Valley, but you gain a 200 HP attacker that's harder to pick off. Its slower, but it gets the job done. That variant only loses Celebi-EX with the rotation, but since it works well with grass you synergize nicely with Vespiquen."
pkmntcg,3dwrom,GSUmbreon,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:23:58 2015 UTC,"The gourgeist is your best bet, but you've got a good amount of setup to do, and you're incredibly vulnerable to gpf-vileplume, bats (which I'm only seeing more variants of), and toad, who will probably continue to be splashed even if he does lose some power after rotation. Especially with no N, you're more dependent on items for quick draw power."

pkmntcg,3dwrom,MrIronGolem27,0,Tue Jul 21 18:56:52 2015 UTC,"Dead isn't the right word, because it was never really ""alive"" to begin with. Night March is an extremely fun deck with or without Mew Ex, but it isn't winning tournaments.    City Championships Winter Regionals States Spring Regionals Nationals   I think there are a couple things that could make it better/worse during the next rotation.    Seismitoad hurts a lot. If it continues to dominate the meta, Night March doesn't really stand a chance.  Bats. Damage that can pick off your little bench pokemon AND then you have an attacker that can also knock off your active Pokemon is brutal. In my opinion, the gist of Night March is I trade two of my pokemon for every one of your EXs. When they can take three for every one EX, you can't win. Weakness. Maybe with the Eeevees from AO, you could pull off a Shrine of Memories Gourgeist (or, lol, maybe people start putting Litwicks in their decks) and you can start hitting pokemon for big weakness damage. Five Night March Pokemon in the discard plus a Muscle Band is 220 damage with weakness. That knocks out just about everything.    I dunno though. I'd guess that it stays about where it's currently at. People will play it because it's easy, cheap, fun, and it wins against lots of other non-top-tier decks. But, I don't think it will start winning any significant tournaments unless some crazy new cards come out in a future set."
pkmntcg,3dve7a,greekars22,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:07:03 2015 UTC,I think the deck is dead until the meta goes back into big basics. We might see use of pyroar as a tech in fire based decks later on. (If fire types get some love besides FF then we may see it included with future set releases.)

Also wailord won because it couldn't be OHKO, this card can heal sure, but there are some heavy hitters that can take him out in one shot, and this card doesn't bounce back as quickly. Archie require empty hands and is your supporter, while having Lotad lines means you have a ton of basics and stage ones, along with using two kinds of stadiums. Wailord is much more stable and consistent, but it will be losing Suicune and Max potion, so I don't think it will last much longer"
pkmntcg,3dvovv,Arkardian,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:43:40 2015 UTC,"I am intrigued by this card as well. Its HP, however, is simply not high enough for it to make effective use of its Ancient Trait - it will be KO'd before it has the chance to heal. Its grass weakness is also a problem. Vespiquen will be big in the next metagame, and a lot of other grass decks will see use thanks to Forest of Giant Plants. With that being said, fire decks may see more play, so I have thought about making the non-Ancient Trait Ludicolo the deck's main attacker and the Ancient Trait Ludicolo the tech for weakness. This arrangement avoids the the liability of a grass weakness and manages the inevitability of fire counter decks. The problem is the low damage output, but perhaps Captiviating Rhythm can manage around that problem in some way.   Either way, I am always hopeful that good ideas will churn up."

By moving damage counters you can pretty much win by  attacking 2-3 times especially if the opponent plays Skyfield. I always aim for a 6 prize turn unless I need to kill the active before it kills all my Noiverns.  The biggest problem I have faced is getting the Noiverns loaded since you can't give Noibat a DDE. It also becomes a problem if you fail Echolocation in the wrong spots."
pkmntcg,3dv4cn,Hukutus,0,Sun Jul 19 20:32:22 2015 UTC,I've been working on a deck that involves Mega Gallade EX & [Echolocation] Noivern.  It's currently named—I Am the Batman.  You can tinker with that concept a bit. I haven't completed it or run any test runs with it—but it seems like a strong deck given you can get Noivern out there first and tag damage onto all their Pokémon. Then use Mega Gallade to clean up—and [Cursed Eyes]Absol to quickly finish off any big threats.
pkmntcg,3dv4cn,ReapThaWhirlwind,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:54:07 2015 UTC,"It does seem like a good idea, especially since you can do more damage with Noivern than you can with evolving Pineco into Forretress, and both Gallade and Noivern use Psychic energy to attack.

pkmntcg,3duvtp,reyztec,2,Sun Jul 19 20:11:08 2015 UTC,"It's a fairly simple process to ""fix up"" a theme deck. You can give it the structure of a more competitive deck and improve the trainers... but it still won't be that good compared to a competitive deck. The steps are something like this  1- Fix your basic proportions  Theme decks have too much energy, too many Pokemon, not enough useful trainers. You need to have something like 13 energy, 15 Pokemon, 15 supporters and the rest should be other kinds of trainers (items, tools, stadiums).  2- Complete and streamline your selection of Pokemon  First off, fix the evolution lines. No ""3 basics, 2 stage 1s, 1 stage 2"". Needs to have the same number of the final form as you have of the basic. You can reduce the number of intermediate form if you have rare candy. So, e.g. 3-1-3 or 4-1-4 is okay.  Now, get the mix of Pokemon right. Not too many lines of stage 2s. Not too many lines of stage 1s. A decent number of basics that can attack early (low energy cost), have a good setup ability or can wall (good chunky HP). Because you are going for around 15 Pokemon, something like   A 3-1-3 of stage 2 Pokemon  A 2-2 of a stage 1 Pokemon 4 basic Pokemon   And if possible, have Pokemon that complement eachother. E.g. one has an ability that supports another.  3- Fix your supporters  First, get your draw supporters. Go for 10. E.g. 4 Sycamore, 4 Shauna and 2 Professor Birch. Do not run Tierno ever.  Now, add 2 Lysandre.  You can then add up to three other supporters. Options include defensive cards like AZ, Pokemon Centre Lady and Cassius, Xerosic, Teammates.   When you are thinking about extra supporters, think about how they go with your deck strategy. If you have Pokemon with a good ability that activates when you first play them, choose AZ. If you intend to start with a Pokemon that easily knocked out for set up, consider Teammates.   4- Fix your other trainers  There are some trainers that will go in almost every deck. For starters, put in 3 ultraballs, 3 VS seeker, 2 muscle bands. Almost every deck will play a stadium as well- one that is appropriate for the deck, like rough seas for a water deck. 3 is a good count unless the stadium is absolutely essential, in which case 4. You may want to add an extra  VS seeker, an extra ultraball and an extra muscle band.   A good rule of thumb is to start with 1 switch, make it 2 if you have a lot of Pokemon with high retreat cost. If you need even more switching than that, add an escape rope.   Some items and tools may be needed for your strategy. E.g. hard charms if it is about keeping Pokemon alive, Super Scoop Up for the same reason, or if a Pokemon has a good ability that triggers when you play it down. Other items can be effective given the abilities or attacks of your Pokemon. For example, if your deck has a way to attach extra energy, then Super Potion might be good (it heals 60 damage but makes you discard one energy).   Then there are some good utility cards that you can put in: professor's letter, energy switch, startling megaphone."

That means more trainers, less energy, and no pokemon that aren't helping you win.  /u/Hukutus is correct that the first way to improve the deck is to add in staple trainer cards. Any Ultra Ball, Professor Sycamore, and VS Seekers should be added - 1 or 2 Lysandre is great if you have that. I'd suggest removing the Spearow, Fletchling, Pidove, Swablu, and Dunsparce lines (so everything that evolves from them), as well as Victini. Ask him if he wants to keep the Salamence line (meaning you need fire or Double Dragon Energy), or if he would rather try to run a deck that's Water/Colorless.  Let us know what cards you have to work with - that's how we can figure out the best 60 cards for the deck."

Even Manectric EX has the potential to OHKO Mega Ray without trying too hard.  The thing that helps Mega Ray is speed and consistency. But if it falters for a second, Mega Manectric will be right behind it."

I know that $5 for a single VS Seeker sounds awfully expensive, but there's a reason they cost so much. They're that good!   Shauna and Prof Birch are looking to be the next best draw supporters after Sycamore so getting a playset of those wouldn't be a bad idea either.   Muscle Band, Trainer's Mail, Super Scoop Up, Switch,  and Acro Bike are played pretty frequently also."
pkmntcg,3dt9lb,aqlno,2,Sun Jul 19 06:16:26 2015 UTC,I am coming from MtG so 5$ for a staple is ok with me considering then staples from my legacy deck where at cheapest 5$ and went all the way to 200$ at one point. :D  Thanks this is helpful.
pkmntcg,3dt9lb,aqlno,2,Sun Jul 19 06:38:23 2015 UTC,"No problem! I think you'll certainly enjoy how cheap Pokemon is compared to magic!   One staple that I didn't mention which is not a trainer is Shaymin EX.  With the most powerful draw supporters rotating out, Shaymin is only going to become more important. You should probably invest in two minimum right now before they get even more expensive!"
pkmntcg,3dt9lb,aqlno,1 point,Sun Jul 19 06:56:06 2015 UTC,Yeah I am a little hesitant on making a big purchase before knowing what deck I want to try to play. Night March seems cool but also really gimicky.

It's probably best to wait for a month or two after rotation to see how the meta settles, then make purchasing decisions. At the moment it's all speculation as to what exactly will be good in the new meta.   Night March is better than just a gimmick, but is losing some key cards that really made it shine."

Also, switching to Kalos Starter-On right now is useless. All it does is make you lose. Enjoy seeing me use N and Computer Search. Haha you got ahead of me now I'll punish you with N."
pkmntcg,3dt9lb,MNChino,1 point,Sun Jul 19 14:06:34 2015 UTC,"Because we are losing so many powerful draw supporters, Shaymin EX will be one of the best ways to draw cards. Professor Sycamore, Ultra Ball, Super Scoop Up, Trainers' Mail, and Lysandre are cards to go with that draw engine that will be legal for 2+ years.  Since Supporters are so weak, with the exception of Professor Sycamore, drawing cards will be more Item-based.   Edit: I forgot VS Seeker, that will be quite important as well."
pkmntcg,3dty5j,MNChino,3,Sun Jul 19 13:01:05 2015 UTC,"M-Ray might want to be more careful, using Altaria.  Yveltal doesn't work.  Too slow.  I think...?  Toad has less firepower and more enemies, but still works  M-Sceptile looks great, but has Flareon to rival it  Vespiquen seems great, but when I tested it, I went through my entire deck in 3 turns consistently and could not do enough damage to things like dragons or fairies  Primal Groudon could manage still, but has new grass rivals  Virgen won't happen  Girintina EX can work, but it needs a bit of setup Time  Vileplume/Girintina-EX can work if you play it right, but would require a ton of setup.  Faries can gain an edge against Girintina, but still will suffer to energy crushing decks  Camerupt-EX, if you want, has more enemies it can beat, but still is inconsistent in getting attackers out, because it lacks emboar.  In theory, that is.  M-Manectric may not do enough damage to some decks, but will barely have any weaknesses.  Gengar/Trevanent breaks without float stone.  Raichu/Eeveelutions might work, but not against Girintina  Kyle Sukevich (Or how his name is spelled), well, I believe it was him, also published an article on the official pokemon website on what decks don't work.  As for what decks will work at big events like regionals, I believe they will be the ones that either hit for weakness or Don't have a weakness.  Weakness will be ever important."

As long as I can take out exs faster than you can take out 2 pokemon which is easy ill win. See you only cafe about doing a ton of damage with your deck while I use strategy to wreck you. :)

There are many online Q&As that go through bits and pieces, but not everything all at once.  The best feedback I've got so far is to: 1. Only use tape on the outside of the box & never on the cards/bubble wrap.  Saran Wrap is the best thing for inside the box. 2.Use post-it-tabs inside the Semi Rigid holders when submitting the cards.  It makes it easier for the graders to remove the cards.  I'd love to hear your feeback too"

pkmntcg,3ds48x,primase,0,Sun Jul 19 06:01:42 2015 UTC,Thank you for the walk through. It basically confirms that I don't really have a chance for any 10s. I spot imperfections everywhere even the very tiny ones. I got maybe a 3 tens. Lots of 9s. If I get them graded.
pkmntcg,3ds48x,primase,2,Sun Jul 19 03:18:30 2015 UTC,"9s are still great grades.  Many people question why 10s sell so high when in reality they are tough to grade.  Even mid grade cards 5-7 are still high grades depending on what cards your talking about (errors & short print event cards).  If you think you only have 3, I'd recommend sending through another user versus buying a membership (SilverSnorlax204 or PatriotsFan are my recommendations for the US)."
pkmntcg,3ds48x,primase,2,Sun Jul 19 05:32:27 2015 UTC,I've already sent two to /u/patriots_fan. I honestly just want to sell the tens so I can get some other graded.

I have seen very few graded SR M charizard x that were gem mint sold but the did go for more the $100.  Getting a card graded doesn't have to be solely based on the monetary value of the card itself the case which PSA uses is a grate way of ensuring the longevity of a card IMHO it's the ultimate card protection/ storage solution.  Also SR's IMHO are absolutely worth getting graded particularly if they are of the 2nd most recognised Pokemon. People may have play sets of them but how many people is that? How many actually pulled a full play set an how many bought singles just so they could say they had a play set?   SR's average at 2 per case these days that's 2 cards out of 2,160 so yes given the pull rate factor and the fact that it's of one of the most iconic Pokemon out there it's worth grading   Ps. /u/patriots_fan provides a middleman service every month for $9 a card so it would be cheaper then submitting it yourself"

pkmntcg,3dskiv,IceManC86,2,Sun Jul 19 01:45:50 2015 UTC,The Holo Neo Lugia is worth a lot as well.
pkmntcg,3dskiv,DictatorMad,2,Sun Jul 19 04:06:25 2015 UTC,What is gold mine I see here. I wish I had this kind of collection as a kid.
pkmntcg,3dr11r,IceManC86,1 point,Sat Jul 18 16:59:05 2015 UTC,One more Mega Manectric is a must for consistency. What if you have to discard some early or have 1 or 2 prized?  Also since Yveltal has a huge target on its back right now (Raichu isn't going away anytime soon) I would suggest modifying the list to have a 1-1 or 2-2 line of Vulpix/Ninetales (Primal Clash) to lock Shadow Circle in play.
pkmntcg,3dr11r,asdjklghty,1 point,Sat Jul 18 20:12:35 2015 UTC,"I like the ninetails idea. I totally overlooked Raichu's current popularity, so Ninetails would help immensely with that match up."
pkmntcg,3dr11r,JauntyAngle,1 point,Sun Jul 19 00:32:22 2015 UTC,"First of all, well done on making your deck lists so clear!   I agree with u/asdjklghty about the thickness of the mega lines. If it's your primary attacker, two isn't enough. Two is a good number for an important support Pokemon, not the whole damn show.   I think in both decks the level of draw support is a bit low if you're not running Shaymin. The Yveltal/Manectric deck especially. I am curious to know why you went for different splits between Birch and Sycamore in the decks, and didn't max out Sycamore- resource conservation? I'm not saying what you did is wrong, just keen to know.  On the fairy deck, I don't have too many specific recommendations, but I would encourage you to consolidate the trainer line a bit. Gardevoir is a bit slow- with two evolution lines and the need to start with a couple of Geomancies. I think to compensate for that you need to make it as consistent as possible. I would try to reduce or eliminate a few things and beef up some of the key things. Get the ultraball count up, maybe another VS seeker.  In the Manectric-Yveltal deck, I would dump the flash energy. Special energy has to be really amazing to be worth the place. Otherwise it's just hammerbait."
pkmntcg,3dr11r,asdjklghty,1 point,Sun Jul 19 00:43:39 2015 UTC,"The mega thickness is an issue I've been looking at changing but most certainly will now that I've gotten feedback.  The split draw supporter choice stems from a weird angle I experience. I don't share materials between decks (separate builds/cards) which has caused me to get rather weird with my preferences. I run 4 Birch/2 Sycamore in fairies because I invested in a play set of FA Birch while they were sub $6 at my local shop and I only possess two Reverse holo Sycamore currently. As well, I tend to lean away from discarding with Fairies because a lot of materials exist for late game use. I can't count how many times I've discarded something useful early game via sycamore that would has turned the game around in the end like Malamar or Exp. Share. Everything in my fairies deck is top dollar version minus the Ultra Balls and 1 VS Seeker which tends steer a lot of my deck choices. I prefer to look at my draw choices as ""8 draw cards"" which are allocated to the different cards, in this case, 4 Birch, 2 Sycamore, 2 Ace. I don't know how I feel about Ace Trainers ATM and I plan to play test him extensively after I can get some either at Pre-Release or on the 12th. I might feel like -1 Ace and +1 Sycamore.  Manectric draw is different, I don't like using Birch often but love Sycamore (dump energy for Turbobolt/Oblivion Wing). I was considering doing a 4 Sycamore, 3 Birch, 1 Ace but my uncertainty with Ace trainers returned. I do agree with removing the flash energy now. It seems useless when its there just for Manectric and sort of is hammerbait.  I've also considered running shaymin, but as of right now, I'm only sitting on two copies which are my binder copies (I master collect) and I would prefer not to touch those. My uncle has 5 spare copies of which 1 is mine but I'm waiting for his rationality to come back before I try to trade for them because he is trying to charge too close to market price considering its a closed player system (neither of us sell anything without notifying the other first so as to keep materials between us). Once I can get 3 of them off him for under $50 or sub $30 with trades Ill start working with shaymin again.  So as of now for Fairies I'm thinking:   1 Xerneas EX 1 Ace Trainers 1 M-Gardevoir EX 1 Sycamore I feel like Regirock/Xerneas EX are cards that will switch often based on the meta. Right now Regirock works as a hammerblocker but that tactic may very well drop out come Giratina in which case I may feel more inclined towards a non-M attacker, it is note worthy that baby Xerneas can knock out Giratina EX for one less energy.   And for Manectric I'm thinking:   2 Flash 1 Ace Trainers 1 Paint Roller 1 M-Manectric 1 Vulpix 1 Ninetails (prevent Raichu auto-loss) 1 Sycamore"
pkmntcg,3dr11r,cellojake,1 point,Sun Jul 19 01:41:29 2015 UTC,Also for Fairy why are you running AZ? You have to discard the Spirit Link and Energy. Why not run Super Potion?

pkmntcg,3dqdop,cellojake,1 point,Sat Jul 18 15:40:26 2015 UTC,"I don't think Gengar will be worth playing in this strategy after rotation - losing float stone, and virbank city gym.   May as well just attack with Trevenant"
pkmntcg,3dqdop,Ribenar,1 point,Sat Jul 18 12:54:36 2015 UTC,"hmmm, its attack is pretty decent, seeing as with valley in play it's only 2 energy.  I wonder if it would be worth its own deck.  Don't really know what other pokemon you could play as support though."
pkmntcg,3dqdop,Ribenar,1 point,Sat Jul 18 12:59:11 2015 UTC,"The same can be said with Trevenant's attack - they both deal the same damage.  Gengar poisons, Trevenant does 20 to two benched pokemon.  I feel like the deck space you have to devote to setting up both Trevenant in the active, Gengar on the bench, and all the switching required to maintain the item lock just isn't worth it after rotation"
pkmntcg,3dqdop,JauntyAngle,1 point,Sat Jul 18 13:02:53 2015 UTC,Dark Corridor + band + poison = 90 damage. That's a magic number for a 2HKO on regular EXs. It's pretty good.
pkmntcg,3dqdop,Ribenar,2,Sat Jul 18 13:03:57 2015 UTC,"Yes I agree but the problem is float stone is gone, Keldeo is gone, computer search is gone, virbank city gym is gone.  How are you going to keep switching back and forth without using tons of resources?  The deck space needed to maintain this attack just isn't worth it.  This is coming from someone who plays Gengar/Trevenant.  4 Gengar, 4 switch, 4 escape rope?  All of this is just have 10 damage poison instead of 20 damage to 2 bench pokemon?  May as well put 4-4-4 bats.  The bat damage can be used to create a knockout on the active, or splashed onto the bench to snipe key supporter pokemon.  Golbat/Crobat retreat for free and attack for free with dimension valley."
pkmntcg,3dqdop,JauntyAngle,1 point,Sat Jul 18 13:13:19 2015 UTC,"Good idea, I'll test bats.  That could definitely help get the KOs on EXs."
pkmntcg,3dqdop,Ribenar,1 point,Sat Jul 18 13:16:09 2015 UTC,True. Gengar-Wobbafet probably works better for that reason.   I really like Gengar-Wobbafet anyway. It is so smooth and consistent. And psychic assault is a great sweeping attack.
pkmntcg,3dqdop,JauntyAngle,1 point,Sat Jul 18 13:57:16 2015 UTC,"Hm.  I hadn't thought of that, that sounds like it could be pretty powerful as well"
pkmntcg,3dqdop,JauntyAngle,1 point,Sat Jul 18 14:08:24 2015 UTC,"Beautifly would be fun. You could even add 1-2 Wobbafet, although when Wobbafet is active it would stop Beautifly's ability. Which sounds make it vulnerable to bench damage from an EX.  It will probably be the first AO deck I will build."

There is a difference in the text that causes it to be slightly different from other Rainbow Energy cards. It states that it causes 10 damage to a Pokemon when played versus the current instruction that a person should place a damage counter when played (there is a difference between causing damage and placing a damage counter).  So one can use Team Rocket Rainbow Energy, but they need to have another Rainbow Energy card with the correct ruling on it with them (EX Ruby & Sapphire, HGSS, or XY)."

What that means is every year 3-5 sets are rotated out of Standard play, to make room for the sets of cards to be released in the coming season.   The next rotation is set to begin after Sept 1st. Rotation will be XY-on, so only cards from the XY block will be legal to play in the Standard format. Because of this it's best to only look to play decks that use XY-on cards. All of the best decks in the current format use cards that will rotate and be illegal to play.

Use your Supporter for something Else) Skyla (no need to explain) Energy Retrieval (You can use Yveltal to retrieve energy) 1 Letter (One is enough) Take out Switch. Use Darkrai EX when you can. Darkrai is so cheap you won't make a bad investment. He got printed as a promo. He's a $5 card. Trevor is a meh card. Using your Supporter for the turn to search for a Pokemon is pretty bad. No need for Pokemon Fan Club   If you really want Malamar you would need a couple Trick Coin or Victini (Victini is so much better even if it's gonna rotate out, it's so much better than Trick Coin).  Add in:   3-4 VS Seeker 1 More Ultra Ball Maybe Darkrai EX More Muscle Band MORE SHADOW CIRCLE. LIGHTING IS BIG NOW 1-1 or 2-2 Vulpix/Ninetales from Primal Clash to lock Shadow Circle in place 2 more DCE A Shauna and a Professor Birch.

If you get get 1 extra energy attachment onto the bench you will be pretty safe. Not sure right now but I might run 4-2 for stadiums. Working out the list still."
pkmntcg,3dmx7x,cellojake,2,Fri Jul 17 16:32:03 2015 UTC,The problem is Medicham's attack ignores weakness and resistance (which is why you use the Meditite's attack with Shrine)
pkmntcg,3dmx7x,thecoolstu,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:41:32 2015 UTC,oh I see. forgot about that...  hm... hype less hype now.
pkmntcg,3dmx7x,cellojake,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:44:36 2015 UTC,"After a bit of thought I think it can still work out, but you will have to run fighting stadium as well. Main reason you want to hit for weakness is for easier knockouts on high hp pokemon. (ex and m-ex) You need to keep shrine of memories in hand until you want to use it for a knockout."
pkmntcg,3dmx7x,cellojake,2,Fri Jul 17 17:06:05 2015 UTC,"Medicham was in my mind, but 90HP was kinda pushing me away from it. I guess Hard Charm could always be a thing of use."
pkmntcg,3dmx7x,cellojake,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:58:10 2015 UTC,110 hp is not too great either. I think the 40 bonus damage from band is more important. The point of medicham is to trade prizes each turn but you take 2 prizes instead of 1.
pkmntcg,3dmx7x,cellojake,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:07:02 2015 UTC,Ohhhh I see I see. Might have to take Medicham into consideration.
pkmntcg,3dmx7x,cellojake,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:30:54 2015 UTC,I think it might be a cheap deck worth doing while the meta settles. Not  sure about running it at majors though.
pkmntcg,3dmx7x,Maiq_The-Liar,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:32:58 2015 UTC,"I could see it doing well at League's and maybe small regionals, but nothing more."
pkmntcg,3dmx7x,RedSeven4,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:50:31 2015 UTC,"I think it could do well at big tournaments a la rouge style, but there are higher chance decks you could play. That statement also depends on how consistent it can be made.    I think its definetly good through cities as a cheaper alternative while the meta settles and before you decide on a ""top deck"" to play for states ect, but has the potential to take the tournament. Just as an example (i guess expanded format with celebi-ex) you could oneshot a verizion ex, and if they have no other (like mr mime) pokes on the board you can take out an additional ex. Thats a 4 prize turn for 1 energy and a non ex attacker. This deck might see more successful play in expanded but we will have to see. It is a safe deck to build for the first week of the new format."
pkmntcg,3dmx7x,cellojake,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:58:36 2015 UTC,Use focus sash instead of hard charm. Most knock outs from me playing medicham have been 1HKOs.

pkmntcg,3dmx7x,aqlno,2,Fri Jul 17 16:21:47 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'm definitely looking forward to building this as a ""budget"" deck that could perform well without having to break the bank!"
pkmntcg,3dmx7x,exxtrooper,2,Fri Jul 17 16:48:49 2015 UTC,Forgot all about Level Ball coming back until just now. That'll be nice for decks that use the bats. As well as fairies being able to grab Aromatisse easier.

pkmntcg,3dmx7x,GSUmbreon,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:34:30 2015 UTC,"Yeah this format is going to be all about Mega's, just like the VGC these past two years. I can't see a deck that couldn't take advantage of a mega besides Night March, if that's still viable."
pkmntcg,3dmx7x,Dave_47,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:02:09 2015 UTC,"It does seem like it's either going to be ""do huge amounts of damage, or prevent others from doing that damage."" I think M-Ampharos has potential because it either OHKOs, or locks the opposing Pokemon in place for a KO next turn. The energy is a bit much though.  I think there will be non-mega decks, but they'll need to do a large amount of damage to keep up. One-prize attackers are still pretty decent in an EX-ridden format."
pkmntcg,3dmx7x,asdjklghty,1 point,Sat Jul 18 00:22:16 2015 UTC,"Medicham seems good the problem is what to wall with to give you a turn to setup. With a Strong Energy, Basic Energy, Muscle Band and Fighting Stadium, you hit for 180 damage in a turn. If you want to, you could attach 2 Strong and hit for 220 damage! OHKO Colorless M Rayquaza since it doesnt apply Resistence."

Also, now will I start making a Medicham deck in real life not just on PTCGO. Destroyer King seems fun as well. M Rayquaza with HOOPA-EX! Grab a M Rayquaza, Shaymin EX and something else off his ability. Then, play Winona and grab another Rayquaza EX, Shaymin EX and M Rayquaza EX. Draw a bunch of stuff, discard energy, attach Spirit Link, Mega Turbo and DCE onto Active M Rayquaza! EMERALD BREAK FOR 240!   Shown Here   Save the best for last... DA PRIMALS!!!!!

pkmntcg,3dnmgj,mikedewb,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:06:09 2015 UTC,"Pretty fun mirror-match, there. Aegislash-EX really has been growing on me over the last month. Seeing your opponent discard those double-colorless really illustrated its strength. It won't hit for quite as much, but it slows down set-up for a number of attackers, letting you gain the advantage.  I'd be interested in seeing it against other decks, especially Seismitoad/Garbodor and Primal Groudon."
pkmntcg,3dnmgj,mrogersj5,1 point,Fri Jul 17 23:35:00 2015 UTC,"Primal Groudon can do just fine against Aegislash. As soon as you see metal, you start building up a Groudon with no strong energy. It's not that tough as mega turbo only attaches basic fighting. A lot of P-Groudon builds also run silent labs, too."
pkmntcg,3dnmgj,JauntyAngle,1 point,Sat Jul 18 00:57:19 2015 UTC,"The issue with Primal Groudon is speed. With Bronzong, Aegislash can quickly power up to move through Groudon's walls. Bronzong/Aegislash would be fascinating to watch because of metal's speed versus Groudon's blocking. I'm thinking less about Silent Lab and much more about Wobbuffet.  The other key I'd see is Groudon versus the prize trade. If Groudon KO's an Aegislash, it can face another one the next turn. Or a Cobalion can take half its HP with a muscle band and Energy Press. The key to me would be if the Groudon player can power up a 2nd Groudon in time if metal streams attackers."
pkmntcg,3dnmgj,mrogersj5,1 point,Sat Jul 18 01:05:48 2015 UTC,"Well, yes, Wobbafet! Wobbafet gives you all the time you need. And Groudon can easily come back from a couple of prizes down.   I play Primal Wobbadon quite a lot and I have to say that steel is rarely a match up I am concerned about. I would rate it about 70-30 for Groudon. If anything, the biggest pain is not Aegislash, it's Dialga's chrono wind. It's easy to run out of switch and end up having to manually retreat but not having much else to attack with."
pkmntcg,3dnmgj,JauntyAngle,1 point,Sat Jul 18 01:15:06 2015 UTC,"I've been putting off running a Primal Groudon deck for a bit now. I ran a 1-1 in Donphan before ROS, after /u/redados won Missouri states with it earlier this year. Playing Lando/Bats online this week, I've honestly got a worse record against Groudon than I've had against Seismitoad. Omega-Barrier is so good with Primal-Groudon, especially as it allows the player to dictate the pace and get the first hit, which in my case is usually a OHKO on my EX."
pkmntcg,3dnmgj,mrogersj5,1 point,Sat Jul 18 09:24:49 2015 UTC,"It's been my winningest deck, other than Yveltal variants and Accelgor-Trevanant in expanded (which is like playing solitaire most of the time).   I really think it's one of the best few decks out there, but people often don't build it in a way that is quite consistent enough or doesn't give the best platform for it. I see decks with other  EX, with 11 energy, with only 4 stadiums... all sorts of stuff that messes it up. But whatever, I will keep playing it, because it is just so satisfying when they can't hammer, Lysander or laser you. And so satisfying when you get the basic elements in place against Toad and know you are going to win."

Aegislash EX has been performing really well against them thus far. With Primal Groudon, players usually tend to run 2 Silent Labs, so they have a really hard time snagging up their last 2 prize cards (at least from my battling experiences)."

Maybe consider taking out the Hawlucha it's nice card against EX Pokemon, but I feel like he may make it a little clunky especially if you are trying to accelerate for the Machamp EX I think Landors and Volcarona should be enough.  Consider Trainer's Mail to hunt down those Ultra/Level Ball.  I know I would hate to Sycamore good cards if I could have a better chance at getting what I need before the ultimate discard and draw 7"
pkmntcg,3dkjvr,stevan90,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:11:46 2015 UTC,"I don't think you really need both Volcarona and Landorus, since they are both only for energy acceleration."
pkmntcg,3dkjvr,Hukutus,0,Fri Jul 17 00:52:23 2015 UTC,"Volcarona searches for the machamp and gives it 2 energy from the deck, but is also a stage 1. Landorus doesnt search, but it allows me to recover from energy discards, and to recover the energy from KO'd pokemon. Both are there for energy ramp, but do it through two different, and complimentary methods. The decks biggest issue while I was testing was that Machamp can't do anything effective without his second attack, so the ramp is needed to get to the deck's core wincon. Do you really think I should drop one? and if so, which?"
pkmntcg,3dkjvr,TheProtagonist2,1 point,Fri Jul 17 01:14:21 2015 UTC,I would commit to Volcanora. It finds Machamp and powers them up. Beautiful.  Do the Xerneas strategy: March that poor bastard out there and use the first attack until he dies from it. Maybe play Wally + Shaymin in the deck. I think a turn 1 Volcanora is really important. It's a pokemon search and two energy attachments. That's just swellow.
pkmntcg,3dkjvr,awoods5000,-2,Fri Jul 17 17:15:23 2015 UTC,"You could use some giant plant forest stadium if you plan on relying on something as weak as Ariados this heavily.   this deck might be fun to play with against bad decks but it isn't going to counter the competitive decks. it suffers from ""first decklist syndrome"" because it has too many pokemon and takes too long to energize."

pkmntcg,3dkjvr,JauntyAngle,2,Fri Jul 17 01:20:02 2015 UTC,Honestly I don't think you need the grass stadium. Machamp takes a while to set up anyways. So you'd have time to get Ariados going. Just run a lot of tutors.
pkmntcg,3dkjvr,JauntyAngle,1 point,Fri Jul 17 12:29:21 2015 UTC,"Steady on. It's about 100x better than the average first decklist. A lot competitive decks have more Pokemon than this,  it's probably just a wee bit clunky."

pkmntcg,3dk8qy,kalendae,2,Thu Jul 16 23:06:32 2015 UTC,"Professor here. The rules around the Professor exam have recently changed, and it's probably not the best fit for your son. Right now you have to apply to take the exam, and the purpose of taking the exam is to get certified in one of three areas: tournament organization, TCG judge, or video game judge. The intention is for Professors to be active staff members at events, and not for Professor certification to just be a ""feather in the cap"" for a player.  The best way for your son to feel like his new knowledge is being put to use might be to find a local league where he can play and help teach other interested players. Have you looked into anything like that around you?"
pkmntcg,3dk8qy,Asclepius24,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:17:45 2015 UTC,That's a shame. I think a lot of people would like getting some certification on their Pokémon knowledge just for the fun.

pkmntcg,3dk8qy,Captain_X24,1 point,Fri Jul 17 00:45:21 2015 UTC,That's actually part of the problem. All professors would take pretty much the same exam and would therefore have the same certification. The teen who passed the Professor exam and NEVER had a leadership role in a league had the same certification as judge who has handled multiple events in a year over several years.   Professors are supposed to be active members of the Pokemon community. Taking the test and doing with it makes no sense.
pkmntcg,3dk8qy,Wolfgirl90,0,Fri Jul 17 03:08:09 2015 UTC,Professors are supposed to be active members of the Pokemon community.   And that's the problem that's being discussed over here. Who says they have to be? Make a separate position for that. Give it another name if necessary. But let people have fun.
pkmntcg,3dk8qy,Smartinie,3,Fri Jul 17 13:04:42 2015 UTC,"Who says they have to be?   TPCi did when they increased the age minimum for the program to 18 in 2006 and when they introduced the ranking system last season (with implementation happening over the past few months). Pokemon Professors are supposed to be the most dedicated Pokemon fans eager to help out not only at large tournaments, but also at leagues and the Pokemon community at large. And I'm not saying this to be mean or put down kids; I am quite literally parroting what TPCi expects from Professors. There are duties that they should perform and Core Values that they should uphold. Those that are not interested in these things shouldn't join."

Mines are the people that don't talk/do anything else but Pokémon   So you feel the need to put down someone else who happens to be more passionate about something than you are.  It's none of your concern how they spend their time.  Some people enjoy the game and will put more time into it than you, and in turn, they will likely be more successful than you.      It's ironic that you partake in this hobby on one hand, but put it down on the other by saying that it's a negative thing to spend a lot of time on it.  Do you say the same for people who do less niche things like playing football, baseball, hockey, basketball, or whatever sport is popular where you're from?  Do you say the same to people who spend a ton of their time shopping?  If you don't, then you're reinforcing the undeserved negative stereotype against people playing this game who are just doing what they think is fun, because it's not cool enough for you or some random illogical reason.    This applies not just for Pokemon, but for pretty much everything in life.  Just because you don't like something that much doesn't mean other people can't.  The people who devote time to getting better at something are the people who end up being the best at it, in general.  You should accept that they're just doing something they love, but that it's just not for you, rather than saying they have no life, or ""hating"" them, as you put it in this post."

Can they not talk about anything else because they happened to be at a Pokemon event where everyone is playing Pokemon?  Besides, what's it to you that they like the game so much that they play it every chance they get?  Does that affect your own life in such a way that you need to have such a strong reaction against it?  Is this enough for you to ""hate"" them?  No one's telling you to go up there and be best buddies with him, but to hate is a very strong emotion that I feel is disproportionate to what you're describing.    I feel though that you're missing my point.  My point is that you don't have to like people who are passionate or devote their time to doing something that you don't necessarily like.  BUT, rather than hate them or make fun of them, at worst you should just ignore them and accept that you can't possibly do what they do.  My immediate feelings towards these people is that I admire them for their passion, whatever it is they do, that they're willing to put in time to get better at something than everyone else."

I had a bad experience once at a tournament, so this guy is the player I hate the most!  It was an older guy who I later saw with his kid, so he must have been 40-50.  Way too old to be swearing at me over a match.  Game 1 we called a judge over to clarify some rules.  I had played Korrina and didn't want to pull a pokemon, we weren't sure if I could opt not to pull a pokemon since the card text doesn't really imply it.  Judge says you can fail to target a Pokemon, even if there are Pokemon, as the ""deck doesn't know"".  Judge also clarifies that a decision is finalized once I begin shuffling my deck.  Okay, that's all settled.  Game 1 I win.  Game 2 is close.  He puts a muscle down on a pokemon which was a bad play.  Card was certainly down, his hands were off the table.  He's look around the board and realizes his mistake.  About 20 seconds later he grabs the muscle band and starts moving it around unsure where to put.  I say that card was down, you can't move it.  He seems annoyed, oh well.  I end up losing anyway.  On to game 3.  Game 3 I play a Korrina, grab a pokemon, grab an item, and pause for a bit.  I don't start shuffling.  I grab a different item.  My opponent FLIPS out.  ""No no no, you're not fucking doing that!""  Me- ""Exuse me?""  ""You fucking busted my balls earlier. You're not fucking doing that.""  Me- ""I didn't start shuffling my deck.  We just had the judge clarify this earlier, my decision isn't finalized until I start shuffling""  He glares at me for a bit.  ""Whatever kid.""  Bleh.  Keep trying to make friendly small talk.  I end up winning game 3.  Tell him good luck on the rest of his matches, and good game.  ""Yeah not really but whatever."""

The stress of that in a tournament setting (perhaps they've been having bad runs that day, or aren't where they thought they'd be) can do this to some people.    Perhaps their demeanor will change after the game - have you tried chatting with them right after the game/tournament ends?

However, accept the fact that some people are not interested in innovating, but just want to play a solid meta deck against other solid decks.  I don't necessarily think they're out to spite you... just have different interests in mind.

You will only need to discard the tool, which u can recover later on with a new trainer coming out. Scoop up might be good as well, but I think running 1-2 AZ really adds to the synergy with shaymin and Aromatisse.    In terms of items I am not sure if I like 2 professors letter, unless you have a reason for it.  I think you also need 4 fairy garden, prob drop a switch for it. Trainers mail is more effective once you get more copies. Finally I do not know if you need megaphone with garb out of the format."

pkmntcg,3diikm,cellojake,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:49:23 2015 UTC,I do not remember the name but its in AO. I think fairy still needs a max potion component as it makes use of fairy transfer. Other wise its basically a free retreat/efficient attacking ability.    U will want 4 copies of vs seeker to make sure you can useyour 1-2 azs when you need to. Effectivly running 5-6 in your deck will increase having 1 when you need it.

pkmntcg,3diikm,MNChino,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:32:11 2015 UTC,"Another idea if you want fairies is Florges EX focused decks.  The lead attack will come in handy against both Girintina and Vileplume to find Xerosic, Team Flare Grunt, or Hex Maniac.  Also, it can take use of Skyfield.  However, it's pretty fragile.  Another Fairy build I've heard of is the one with M-Rayquaza.  I have no idea if it works out.  I've played M-Gardevoir before. but only a little.  I would definitely side to take out Aromatisse for Whimsicott, but that won't always work, because some decks do enough to 1HKO M Gard.  Aromatisse might be good to stick around instead because there is no Landorus EX to target it."

Although you can say that both of those are pretty fringe decks."
pkmntcg,3diikm,asdjklghty,1 point,Fri Jul 17 03:37:16 2015 UTC,"That said, I suggest at least testing Whimsicott out. It's a monster for healing damage and does not cost you too much momentum, especially against decks that use basic EXs. It is also not disrupted by Vileplume or Toad."

I alredy run 2x super potions, its pretty effective, of course max potion would be better, but it has its upsides too, if you dont get to have aromatise going it only drops 1 energy at times that can make the difference. I also run more Fan Club, seems like a huge card for this ,and 2x evosoda! Evosoda has saved me a lot.Its superior to the level ball youre considering to put in my opinion.  And Energy Retrieval in case Xerneas bites the dust (happens a lot right) and if you actualy are stuck paying retreat costs.  I tend to fare well vs slower/not so ultra speedy decks but stupidly fast decks like M-Rayquaza colorless always seem to beat me.  Im curious about those head ringers.never thought of that.How do they work out for you?  Other AO cards to consider are Lugia EX : Nice backup attacker, and is not weak to steel, plus its good to use if youre low on  energy.And definetly Ace Trainer, would be huge vs fast decks and you can always sacrifice the starting xerneas to have it work"

Yveltal ex requires 1 rainbow and the rest can be fairy for its attacks. Stuff that has low energy costs (colorless costs do not count in this) that have high HP and deal damage work well. You can run every type of pokemon in this kind of deck as rainbow energy can be fairy transfered.  I personally think it is worse as it loses to aegislash (hex maniac on its way though) and also enhanced hammer.

pkmntcg,3di2ei,The_Filthy_Goat,2,Thu Jul 16 20:01:27 2015 UTC,"Well I think fire will shine a bit against all the grass decks that are coming up. Perhaps the biggest concern I'm seeing would be the number of eeveelution stage 1 decks being considered. With that new Vaporeon, you'll end up against some water types that arent water types. The new Golurk and the XY Raichu being possibilites for concern. Though I imagine of the new eeveelutions coming out, vaporeon will likely be the least used of them.   Camerupt EX sets up pretty fast though, so I'm not sure how much of an issue you'll have."
pkmntcg,3di2ei,The_Filthy_Goat,2,Thu Jul 16 13:40:03 2015 UTC,"There is also Entei in AOR that helps this deck.  The non-holo one.  It will allow for easy prize trade against Raichu.  Why?  It does Raichu's attack, with fire energy.  By Raichu's attack, I mean it does 20 + 20X the amount of your opponent's benched pokemon.  Not only that, but Camerupt may even have some space for weakness policy and Repeat ball.  You'll need repeat ball to spam TM Camerupt.  Weakness Policy could work as a tech, because it Camerupt can already do a lot of damage.  Just saying, the price of Camerupt EX is only under $2 now.  This seems very easy and powerful to make."

pkmntcg,3di2ei,exxtrooper,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:28:58 2015 UTC,"How will you be able to hit 80 every turn?  Greninja?  I don't understand.  Toad will hit camerupt for either 60, 100, or 70 or 110 with Ariados.  There is no more hypnotoxic laser, or virbank.  Remember, there also is no N, so you cannot shuffle you opponent's hand back into the deck, unless you use red card.  That means, an opponent can use ultra ball to find a TM Camerupt on the first turn, and evolve it the second.  Weakness Policy will help against this too, but only if you attach before item lock :P  One big thing is the prize trade.  Toad will be guaranteed to 2HKO or less.  If set up camerupt can 1HKO toads.  The last thing is Toad getting outclassed by other decks.  M-Sceptile and Vespiquen in particular.  However, there will always be toad players I guess."

Camerupt is one of my favourites in ORAS and I hope with the rise of grass in AOR fire would see a bit of resurgence.  Some thoughts:   Water weakness: Without laserbank, Toad can still hit you with a [C][C], muscle banded Quaking Punch for 100. Maybe 2 or 3 investment in Weakness Policy would work. Bench: You would probably run a close to full bench with Camerupts EX in active and a bunch of TM Camerupts, the latter then becomes easy prey for Lysandres and Escape Rope. Maybe 1 Sacred Ash or TM Admins to recycle them?"
pkmntcg,3dj3a6,exxtrooper,2,Thu Jul 16 18:00:17 2015 UTC,"Kyurem EX, the next shit EX.   Almost every other EX is potentially playable though, and we'll have to see how the new meta shakes out post rotation before we'll have any idea of how much things will cost."

pkmntcg,3dikki,Credits_PTCGO,2,Thu Jul 16 15:43:57 2015 UTC,"If it was special energy, it might get played.  I'm not killing my tempo to find another supporter and a basic energy. Your supporter for the turn will most likely net you enough cards to find an energy, another supporter (albeit random), and a bunch of other things."
pkmntcg,3dikki,TheProtagonist2,2,Thu Jul 16 15:52:25 2015 UTC,"Well if the translation error was correct and Steven grabbed a special energy, I would use him A LOT, since the majority of my decks use special energy. However, with his current play I would not use him to ruin my tempo to grab another supporter that can be easily used to grab other supporters, energy, Pokemon, and items. Skyla is great since you can grab Trainers other than supporters, Korrina is similar but you can grab any Fighting Pokemon and an Item card."
pkmntcg,3dikki,Ipokeyoumuch,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:28:08 2015 UTC,What error?

pkmntcg,3dikki,hiltzy85,2,Fri Jul 17 14:33:13 2015 UTC,"i play him as a 1-of sometimes, and I never feel too bad having him.  Early in the game, he goes and finds pokemon fan club or N or sycamore, late game he goes and finds lysandre or colress and of course, he always pulls and energy out too, which is great if I need one, and if I don't, well, at least I won't feel badly about discarding it with sycamore or ultra ball, and it's one less energy that i'm going to draw through other supporters."
pkmntcg,3dikki,ReapThaWhirlwind,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:16:29 2015 UTC,"Steven is a great card to use to close up loose ends when you're running a Supporter split that's very tactical and/or narrow—which due to the style of such a strategy—needs a bridge between your diverse pieces to bring everything together.  On your first turn, Steven makes a great play to fetch you an energy and the exact Supporter card that you need for your second turn. It's a great set up, and boost for hands where you might get stiffed with only a single energy (like when playing with deck structures the incorporate low energy amounts).  On your second turn, when your deck strategy involves a different specific Supporter for your first turn (such as Wally)—Steven makes a great follow up to keep the momentum of your cards in motion (opposed to getting hung out to dry on your second turn, without an energy and/or a Supporter card to boost off of).   When you're running extremely tactical splits (like 2 Lysandre, 2 Pokémon Center Lady, 2 Professor Juniper)—running 4 Steven can get you the exact Supporter card you need (when you need it) without the bother of drawing into ones that aren't of any use to you at the moment.  It also works very well with tactical splits revolving around card advantage supporters (such as 2 Professor Juniper, 2 Cheren, 2 Shauna, 4 Steven).  There are times when Professor Juniper will force you to discard cards that you truly can't afford to discard, where Steven can be used to bypass that drawback, and grab you other Supporter cards instead (like Cheren or Shauna)—which refresh your hand without purging any precious resources.  Traditionally, running such low numbers of those Supporter cards would provide a measure of diversity to your deck—yet in an unreliable fashion—since you can't reliably control the Supporter cards that you draw into.   However, Steven can now be used as stabilizer for such diverse tactical splits—providing a reliable measure of control over your Supporter card access.  That's just what I can tell you about the card based on my experiences so far. It can be extremely useful, but not every deck strategy suites the card's style—so the card's potential isn't exactly universal. It's moreso a card suited for specific deck structures and strategies as I've explained above."
pkmntcg,3dikki,ReapThaWhirlwind,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:47:09 2015 UTC,"Great reply,  thanks for taking the time! Whoever the idiot was to downvote, take a hike fool and grow a brain!  I never really applied it to be specifically for low.energy using decks. My method was precisely to draw the supporter i needed for next turn. I know that using something like shauna or birch could work but calculating it based on numbers, steven always had the upper hand but then there was the situation of lowering the overall percentage even having one of him in there."
pkmntcg,3dikki,cellojake,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:45:21 2015 UTC,"It also works really well when your Stage 2 evolution line jumping with Wally. Turn 1 you can use something like Level Ball to fetch your Stage 1—then use Steven to fetch you Wally for turn 2.  On turn 2, you evolve to Stage 1—then jump right to Stage 2 with Wally. Using Steven enables you to run less Wally (since it can hold you back when it's of not use to you). If you don't get it on your first turn, then Steven can get it for you to use on turn 2.  Not that packing your deck with lots of Wally can be bad—because extra Wally make great bait for cards like Ultra Ball, Computer Search, Dowsing Machine—etc."
pkmntcg,3dikki,Asclepius24,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:29:35 2015 UTC,"Yes, i like that provided you draw  him and dont have him prized it can basically be looked at as another wally with the added benefit of getting that energy incase you dont draw that also. This is how i also look at prof letter in regards to it being just another energy card, increasing the draw statistic  I knew he had more of a constructive use, thanks for sharing :)"
pkmntcg,3dikki,MNChino,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:21:09 2015 UTC,"I will not get into tempo and other reasons as I think draw supporters are not as important as they used to be.    I think skyla just outclasses it in every way. (still in the next format with promo soon) Steven can only get supporters, while skyla can get trainers, stadiums, and supporters. Sure steven lets you find an energy, but you can always just run a professors letter and search for it with skyla to find 2 energy! Steven is just not a very broad card in terms of use."
pkmntcg,3dikki,exxtrooper,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:14:33 2015 UTC,"Thats cool, i didnt see that skyla was being released as a promo in japan!"
pkmntcg,3dikki,MNChino,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:29:45 2015 UTC,"I don't see any reason to play it over a draw Supporter, which will likely yield another Supporter and an energy card as well as other stuff for you to use. It may have some niche applications in the future, but right now there's a reason why exactly zero competitive decks run it.  Now if they'd reprinted Steven's Advice, it would be an entirely different story. But Sky Field would have broken that card, so I understand why they didn't."
pkmntcg,3dikki,exxtrooper,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:30:12 2015 UTC,"I use him to set up next turn.  If Shaymin can provide draw power, it won't matter much.  The energy will make sure you don't miss an attachment, even though you don't get any draw power.  It is what sets this apart from Skyla.  Missing an attachment can be devastating.  There are more and more reasons to search for a supporter too.  Now since N is gone, most likely your supporter will remain in you hand next turn.    To survive decks like Girintina EX, Porygon Z, and Vileplume, or get past weakness from Eeveelutions, you will want to find your Blacksmith, Xerosic or Hex Maniac.  Otherwise, you might be late game, with no need for draw support, but need to find Lysandre.  Maybe you could even use it to find Archie's Ace in the Hole  This made no sense last format when there was Jirachi EX.  But now that's gone."
pkmntcg,3dikki,thecoolstu,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:58:50 2015 UTC,How would this Porygon Z deck you keep talking about work? I'm really intrigued.
pkmntcg,3dikki,Dash-Fl0w,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:56:21 2015 UTC,"It would most likely involve Bronzong, Porygon-Z (not HA one), Enhanced Hammers, and Head ringers. You power it up for slow beam.    This seems very hard to pull off at first, but with things like Metal Energy recycling and EXP shares helping the energy flow, as well as Team Flare Grunt, Enhanced hammer, and crushing hammers to discard your opponent's energy and Head ringer to require more energy for stalling, you put the opponent in a position to not be able to attack. You're doing consistent 70 damage (or 90 with muscle band, if you're running that way) with Porygon-Z, enough to take prizes.  Well, I was thinking it was awesome, because I was originally told that the effect of slow beam applies to ALL of your opponent's pokemon.  However, it only applies to the  defending pokemon, meaning that slow beam's effect will stop once you knock out the defending pokemon.  So it might not be great..  Or it might see success.  I am always considering it a problem though for decks that rely on high amounts of energy, like Girintina EX.  It is a disruption deck that does nice damage, so it can get through a lot of things."
pkmntcg,3dikki,Azukola,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:15:42 2015 UTC,"Really? The translations I'm reading still say all special energy on all opponents pokemon.  Still, it doesnt seem that great against something like M Manetric, Gliscor still seems better in general for energy disruption."
pkmntcg,3diwba,enochism,3,Thu Jul 16 17:10:04 2015 UTC,"Toploader. Make sure you sleeve the card in a soft sleeve first (""penny sleeve"" or an Ultra Pro or something) before it goes in or it'll slide out and get scratched up."

But I have no ideas how decks that don't exist will turn out.  Anyway, one problem I could see is that you could be stuck with Mystery energy, and a pokemon that is not Psychic.  You don't seem to have escape rope or switch, so that will really hurt, because you have to wait until you get a normal psychic to retreat.  Also, Malamar (XY-Promo) might happen to be a deck that you face.  Or other things.  There's a handful of things that cause status conditions, so you need some way to get around them.

And with switches in played, I've changed the energy spread to 8 basic/2 special.  M Sceptile seems like an auto loss as it is nearly impossible to set up a kill given that they switch/heal every turn with multiple M Sceptile in play.

Plus Golbat can hit everything for 10 damage. There's an article on PokeBeach about this deck.  I would say 3 Scoop Ups/1 AZ Should be enough. You should have have 3-4 VS Seeker to recycle Supporters.

I won't say this is the best way to do things, but it's how we have ours to allow us to play all pokemon with interesting pokeodies and pokepowers. We allow evolution to any pokemon with some limitation s and penalties. Mutant evolution can be performed if you play a stage 1 on a basic or a stage 2 on a stage 1. Mutant evolution can only occur if the evo and the pre-evo share a type. Place 2 damage counters on any pokemon that mutant evolves. Normal evolution can take place without the added restrictions and penalties.   Aside from that it's a singleton cube with just about every interesting pokemon we had laying around since we started collecting  and one of every trainer that isn't trash. We play 40 card decks with 4 prizes to focus on shorter games. We do not use any EX pokemon. We also have an added mechanic involving stadiums where they are sort of side-boarded and you can activate it at the cost of a damage counter on your active pokemon with the damage increasing by one each time it is activated."

pkmntcg,3dgu78,cellojake,2,Thu Jul 16 04:12:16 2015 UTC,"First, put every unown you get in the deck.  Great Draw support for a common card (yes, it's a common in the english set).  Second, if you get an EX, base most of your strategy off of it.  At my PHF prerelease, I made my deck M-Manectric (yeah, I got the cards to do that somehow) and just a ton of energy, nothing else!  You want to make sure your strategy will revolve around the EX, because you have little draw support.  Third, Use cards like Ace Trainer or Lysandre in your deck, if you pull them.  Definite help.  Fourth, Find an evolution line that works in your pulls, or use good basics that you see have synergy.  Look at the scans on 60Cards or Pokebeach to get a small sense of what strategy you you could use with every card.  Lastly, remember, your place you finish at really doesn't matter.

pkmntcg,3dgu78,aqlno,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:52:07 2015 UTC,You're probably not going to be able to get too many evolutionary lines to work with random pulls.   The best bet is big basics and whatever EX Pokemon you may pull. To fill in the gaps look at the pokebeach translations of bandit ring and identify cards that have high HP and energy efficient attacks. For example an attack that dead 60-90 damage for two energy is pretty damn good in sealed format.

pkmntcg,3dgn6o,iamanoobnow,1 point,Thu Jul 16 03:01:07 2015 UTC,"I do not have time to go into detail but, this is closer to what competitive decks run: 10-20 pokemon 6-14 energy and the rest are trainers, with 10 of them being ""draw"" supporters. There are other ways to do it but this is the most basic way."
pkmntcg,3dgn6o,cellojake,1 point,Thu Jul 16 03:23:03 2015 UTC,By draw supporters do you mean stuff like Tierno? So I should drop my Pokemon count and up my draw power instead? Thinking of removing the Spheal lines since they don't do much for me anyway.
pkmntcg,3dgn6o,cellojake,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:27:54 2015 UTC,"Stuff like tierno, but more like birch and shauna. Tierno is not a great card right now. Try to only use 1 energy type and run about 12 energy. Cut out some extra pokemon you do not need and fill the rest in with trainers. 4 sycamore 4 shauna 2 birch will do fine. After that u can have things like lysandre and other non draw supporters, add in the rest with trainers that help you find the cards you need. Ultra ball, trainers mail,switch. Stuff like that."
pkmntcg,3dgn6o,cellojake,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:31:43 2015 UTC,"Hmm, ok so from what I'm seeing, cards that reshuffle your hand or discard aren't as bad in Pokemon as they are in other games? Because I'll be honest, I read ultra ball, saw ""discard 2"" and thought it was trash... Also it looks like I should just drop the water type entirely and just use the psychics and kangaskhan."
pkmntcg,3dgn6o,aqlno,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:46:27 2015 UTC,"There are cards that only work with the discard pile (see vs seeker) and also cards that depend on hand size (see shaymin ex ROS.) Ultra ball lets you find ANY pokemon which really helps you find what you need, at the cost of 2 cards. This is an ok trade, and great for certain situations. For example you have an ultra ball and 2  other cards like a switch and a supporter. You can always recover the supporter later with vs seeker, so you ultra ball for shaymin and get to draw 6 cards. In those 6 you find a sycamore, theres another 7. That was 13 cards drawn, 14 if you count the ultraball in one turn. It is very powerful. Ultraball also turns into a pseudo supporter, as you can find shaymins with it. This increases consistency.    Reshuffling is good in pokemon, there are a lot of cards you run, but do not always need. You can discard them or save them for later.    I would (will be slightly different as some popular cards like N will not be in the format) watch ""pokemon nationals 2015 tcg"" on youtube. You will get a great idea on why cards are good (casters are great) and it also shows the cards blown up on screen allowing you to read them easily."
pkmntcg,3dfaaw,tsk8123,2,Wed Jul 15 20:34:15 2015 UTC,"Play Points are awarded for participation in Pokemon events. Championship Points, as you said, are awarded for placing well in tournaments. Here is a link to the Championship Point Chart: http://www.pokemon.com/us/play-pokemon/pokemon-events/pokemon-tournaments/earn-championship-points-tcg/    The best finish limit takes your performances at the series of tournaments and counts only a certain number. Ex: Say I got 1st three times at cities, 2nd two times, top 4 five times, and top eight or worse 6 times. I would only receive championship points for 3 1st places, 2 2nd places, and 1 top eight. The rest of the tournaments would not count towards my championship point total.    The kicker is when more points are awarded based on attendance. Ex: Say I got top 16 at a states. Because there were more than 64 masters I would get championship points. If there were less than 64 I would not recieve Championship Points."

pkmntcg,3dfaaw,mattman222221,2,Thu Jul 16 12:43:39 2015 UTC,"Points come in two categories:   Play! Points: Play! Points are earned based on participation in Pokemon events and activities. These events don't necessarily have to be sanctioned events (e.g. prerelease tournaments). Play! Points can be earned by playing in events and/or by joining a league. At Premier Events, Play! Points are given out based on participation, not by performance; all players in the event will receive the same amount of Play! Points based on the event. Play! Points are sometimes (but not always) required for entry into certain Pokemon events (Nationals has a Play! Point requirement). Championship Points: Championship Points (CP) are earned at Premier Events (League Challenges, Cities, Regionals, States, Nationals, Worlds) and are based on performance. Only the highest ranking players will be awarded CP. The amount of CP awarded to these players is based on their tournament rankings, the attendance of the event, and which event CP was awarded (for example, Regionals gives out more CP than a League Challenge). CP affects one's premier ranking and this ranking is used to determine the top players and is used to give out invitations for the World Championships."

pkmntcg,3dfaaw,Wolfgirl90,3,Wed Jul 15 22:27:56 2015 UTC,"The only tournament that has a CP requirement is the World Championship.  Nationals has a point requirement, but it uses Play! Points instead.  All of the other Premier Events can be participated in without any point requirements."

pkmntcg,3dfv3r,galaspark,1 point,Thu Jul 16 01:42:35 2015 UTC,"The official reason is because the expanded format is supposed to lesson the impact of LTC.   I'm not an expert in anything outside of the current standard meta, so I have no idea how true that may or may not be"
pkmntcg,3dfv3r,cellojake,2,Thu Jul 16 03:00:28 2015 UTC,"Then you realize that the Japanese format was our Expanded format, and they were the ones to ban the card.  No, seriously. The final straw for the card was not Toad Shaymin, but Latios Donk. Get going first turn, then play lasers, pluspowers and muscle bands, recycle pluspowers and use them, then LTC then all over again and repeat until you have about 12 or so pluspower boosts so you can OHKO anything in the format, even Wailord EX with a little luck.  Even if you do survive the first attack, you are down 1-2 prizes and nearly out of time."

pkmntcg,3detkp,5748,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:33:57 2015 UTC,Well that is kind of obvious but the greninjas will not be attacking so it is kind of wasted. Maybe something like mountain ring or asperta city gym is better?  Also should i replace ultra ball with dive balls and pokemon fan club? The only non basics in the deck are the greninja line so I don't see any great usage of ultra ball in this deck.
pkmntcg,3dfav4,MNChino,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:38:12 2015 UTC,The attack lands.  Why would Gourgeist get knock out anyways?
pkmntcg,3dfav4,Rakkis157,0,Wed Jul 15 21:04:33 2015 UTC,"While in play, this card provides every type of Energy but provides only 1 Energy at a time.  Sorry, I'm confused about this. By 1 energy at a time, can it not provide more than one energy type at a time?  I've never seen this issue until now.  When Gourgiest would attack, Rainbow energy would be providing psychic energy.  However, since rainbow cannot provide more than one energy at the same time, it would only provide psychic energy at the time of the attack.  Yet, then, it would not have grass energy, and not enough HP to attack."
pkmntcg,3dfav4,Wolfgirl90,1 point,Wed Jul 15 23:03:17 2015 UTC,"OOOOOHHHH....I got it. I see what your question is now.  The ""1 energy at a time"" thing refers to one unit of energy, not one type of energy. Once played, Rainbow Energy is every type of energy AT ALL TIMES. However, it only ever provides one unit of energy at a time. Understand?  For example, if an attack requires water and fire energy, Rainbow Energy can be used to pay for either the water cost OR the fire cost. But not both at the same time; you still need another energy to attack.  The type of energy that it is providing doesn't change during the declaration of an attack (or anything else for that matter). So, for Gourgeist, if it has a Rainbow Energy attached, it has both 1 Grass energy attached it (for 200 HP) and 1 Psychic Energy for its attack. Gourgeist won't suddenly drop to its original HP just because you attacked."

I just didn't understand that wording."
pkmntcg,3dfav4,Wolfgirl90,1 point,Thu Jul 16 01:10:18 2015 UTC,"what would cause gourgeist to be KO'd? the rainbow counts as both a grass and a psychic (and all other energy), so he's ok."

Its not the best matchup but it still does quite well, and metal decks does not trump it by far.   Hex maniac utterly destroys your own tactic, freeing up the lock, free retreat from vileplume, shaymin, hoopa and the mega safeguard is not worth it imo."
pkmntcg,3detbo,cellojake,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:21:45 2015 UTC,"I think the only reason you would use hex maniac is to shut down aegislash. Like no other reason, although you get to use item cards as well so its not the worst thing."

pkmntcg,3dcqds,Colhouer,4,Wed Jul 15 06:26:07 2015 UTC,"One thing to note is that rotation is coming up after Worlds in August, meaning that many current staple trainer cards (N, Colress, Computer Search) will no longer be legal for tournament play.  To get started playing, the Xerneas v. Yveltal Battle Arena set will give you the two best current theme decks to battle against a friend, and if you combine the trainers from both decks you'll have cards that go in almost any deck: 4 Sycamore, 4 Ultra Ball, 2 Muscle Bands, 2 Lysandre  So in answer to your last question, the current meta is established, but with rotation and the release of Ancient Origins, the meta will get a big shake-up over the next month.  The good news is that it's a good time to pick up the game since the next season begins in September, and beyond local League Challenges and Fall regionals (early October), really doesn't get started competitively until Thanksgiving when City Championships begin.  Welcome, and have fun!"
pkmntcg,3dcqds,onemonkey,3,Wed Jul 15 12:41:29 2015 UTC,"(1) A few people have posted budget decks that are still reasonably competitive. Any of these would be a good way to get back into it.   MikePTCGO and a bluegolfball did a video of two decks costing a maximum of $80 each:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HH2wAyOxfwc  I did two decks, one dark and one fairy, both based on the ""Xerneas vs Yyveltal Battle Arena"" box, that would cost $50- the box plus $30 of singles. u/Asclepius24 also chipped in a list for the dark version:  https://www.reddit.com/r/pkmntcg/comments/33wbtk/a_dark_deck_for_50_battle_arena_plus_singles/ https://www.reddit.com/r/pkmntcg/comments/33o7gx/a_fairy_deck_for_fifty_dollars_battle_arena_plus/  I also recently posted a Medichamp list for building online, but you could do it with physical cards and it would be very cheap- quite a bit less than $50 I would think:  https://www.reddit.com/r/ptcgo/comments/3bu8x3/building_a_fighting_deck_for_free/  (2) The price of a competitive deck can be anything from $50 to $200- more if you get a fully blinged out version. Most probably tend a bit towards the lower end. Things have just a got a little more expensive because a new card, Shaymin EX, has popped up that is so good it is more or less a staple and it cost $30-$35 a pop Competitive decks can be anything from $50 to $200, or more if you bling them out. Most other staples cost anything from 50 cents to 4 dollars. Hopefully the price will decrease.   (3) The meta is relatively established in that everyone knows what most of the decks are. However, what has been changing is their competitiveness. The relative competitiveness of the different decks seems to have been changing very quickly, with very strong decks falling away quickly and other decks coming from the fringes and looking dominant. And this sort of thing has been happening very quickly. Overall a lot of different decks are out there including some that look ""rogue"". It's a very fluid, unpredictable meta, no one really knows what is happening."
pkmntcg,3dcqds,JauntyAngle,2,Wed Jul 15 07:47:50 2015 UTC,"I recently started playing the TCG and was also overwhelmed by the amount and variations of product. But don't worry, you'll get the hang of it in no time.  The meta is wide open right now, and there is quite a lot of diversity in decks. US Nationals was held recently, and no deck in the Top 8 was the same over even similar at all.   Anyway, competitive decks run the gamut. Night March, for example, is absurdly cheap. The main Pokemon involved probably wouldn't cost you most than a few bucks for all of them combined - it's the staple Trainer cards that cost money. Those run from 2-6 bucks each. An Ace Spec like Computer Search might cost you a pretty penny.   I say, before buying any product, buy singles and build yourself a cheap budget deck, like Night March. I recommend Medicham, though. Very underrated deck. After you build yourself a deck and become familiar with the the different cards and expansions, you can be more selective about which products  you buy."
pkmntcg,3dcqds,cormano_sanchez,2,Wed Jul 15 06:43:31 2015 UTC,"The biggest plus about Pokemon is that even if Pokemon come and go, Trainer cards do not.

pkmntcg,3dcqds,Rakkis157,2,Wed Jul 15 07:22:39 2015 UTC,A lot of great suggestions are already posted here. I will say the new set thT is comming out will heavily shake the metA. One becAuse of the cards and two because of rotation. I would get 2 tjeme decks to have fun with your gf until after rotation so the meta can settle. Once it settles your deck might not always be on top but u won't need tk make totally new decks all the time.
pkmntcg,3dcqds,cellojake,1 point,Wed Jul 15 12:55:53 2015 UTC,"I agree with this approach.  Grab two theme decks you like, or the Xerneas vs Yveltal set and mess around for a few weeks.  You can get a feel if you enjoy the game, and then the rotation will be officially announced.  A few of the oldest card sets become ineligible for standard play, and 4 new sets are released throughout the year."

My pulls where bad (or atleast I think bad) but the lady cracked 3 EXs in 12 packs so even if they arent good they are atleast pretty.

I must admit, I'm impressed that you didn't fall into the beginner's trap of thinking more EX = better deck (though you not having many EXs might have something to do with this). Good job here.  Well, since this is a Fighting deck, there are a few additions you can make:   Strong Energy Fighting Stadium   Each of these will add 20 damage to the attacks of each of your Fighting Pokemon, so a Dugtrio with Muscle Band and Strong Energy, with Fighting Stadium in play will hit for 120 damage.   Hawlucha (the regular one, not the horrible EX) is also a pretty decent Pokemon, being able to also hit for 60 for 1 Energy VS EXs. Another card is Landorus, who can accelerate energy to your Pokemon, namely Primal Groudon. I would also suggest taking out a Groudon EX, reason being that without the Primal, it isn't a very good Pokemon. You are better off using a 1-1 line, given that the Primal cannot be Lysandre'd out. If you can get your hands on another Primal Groudon though, then a 2-2 line would be pretty nice.  Another good addition to the deck is the supporter Korrina, who searches out a Fighting Pokemon and an item card, letting you get your Pokemon out more consistently. For that matter, I don't recommend using Maxie for someone who is just beginning. It's a very, very difficult combo to pull off, and in this deck is not really necessary.  Primal Groudon hits for pitiful damage without Stadiums, which you don't seem to be using. I suggest the Fighting Stadium previously mentioned, with maybe Silent Lab, Scorched Earth, Mountain Ring or Virbank Gym depending on what you find yourself needing.  For a deck designed to be fast paced, I recommend running Groudon Spirit Link, so you don't have to burn a turn evolving."

pkmntcg,3ddd9j,Choczy,1 point,Wed Jul 15 11:38:58 2015 UTC,"Welcome to the world of pokemon! I would say that most decks cover just 1 energy type, with tech additions. For example, raichu xy has a good attack for 2 colorless energy, Which allows your to splash in a [l] pokemon without needing to run lightning energy. For now I would stick with just dark typing, and work on building consistency. Check out what some of the top decks from nationals built and look for common trends in trainer choices."
pkmntcg,3ddd9j,cellojake,1 point,Wed Jul 15 12:52:12 2015 UTC,"Thank you for the really good suggestion! I always thought that decks typically ran two colours (looking at theme decks and stuff)  So its real nice to see that they run one colour most of the time as its a headache working out what very few pokemon of each youd want in your team, I guess my MTG brain is trying to invade my new Pokemon brain :')  I did really like the look of night march, and this deck, so Ill make my way toward those :)"
pkmntcg,3ddd9j,cellojake,1 point,Wed Jul 15 13:17:09 2015 UTC,"I would youtube ""pokemon tcg regional"" or national or worlds. Even if they are older videos and the cards are not alloqed the archetypes still exist."
pkmntcg,3ddd9j,RocketGruntD20,1 point,Wed Jul 15 13:55:20 2015 UTC,Yveltal EX is a very powerful card that can be bought for $5usd if you get the promo version (Pokemon prints lots of awesome promos)  You should feel at home playing dark type as it has a bit of disruption like black in mtg.  Be sure and check out the online game! It's free and awesome!

pkmntcg,3dcbmc,DireOwlbear,1 point,Wed Jul 15 03:56:38 2015 UTC,"I have been running Jolteon for months now, and tbh I don't think he can use Flash Energy nearly as affectively as one would hope. Flash Energy cannot be used on an Eevee to quick evolve it, nor can you recycle it with Energy Returner. Even against a Fighting deck, chances are that with their combination of Muscle Bands and Strong Energies, you will be OHKO'd regardless.  Vaporeon and Flareon will be incredibly useful though, as it helps against the deck's worst matchup in the current Standard Format, LandoBats and gives you an edge against decks like Metal or anything else Fire is super effective against.  Blacksmith will not help it in the least, since it needs pure Lightning to hit, and you'd rarely get to use his second attack anyways. Getting Level Ball again would be incredibly useful to fetch out your Jolteon and/or Bats, but Ultra Ball does have the edge of letting it access Shaymin EXs to get the speed it needs  It's a shame that Jolteon will no longer be Standard legal after rotation hits. Otherwise, I'd be rocking the damn place with my good ole' buddy now that I actually have something to deal with that pesky Landorus-EX."
pkmntcg,3dcbmc,Rakkis157,1 point,Wed Jul 15 04:33:25 2015 UTC,i guess you're right about blacksmith but imo flash energy will be super helpful early game if you run into it at the right time. you would also have to run 1/2 sacred ash/revive since you need eevees as bench sitters and attacks  so thats going to eat up some deck space.
pkmntcg,3dcbmc,Rakkis157,1 point,Wed Jul 15 04:49:38 2015 UTC,"Not really. Against LandoBats, Flash Energy would not help at all because they will deal 70 damage to you even with it, leaving you a bat snipe away. On the other hand, Flash Energy is not something you want to run into early on because at that stage getting a Basic Lightning Energy is especially crucial, since the best (and arguably only) way for a Jolteon deck to win is to establish an advantage from the very first turn of the game and never look back. Even if you do end up attaching it, it won't help at all, because Jolteon's attack forces you to discard it to hit hard. In the 150+ games I have played with the deck, I rarely have any energy sitting on your Pokemon at all."
pkmntcg,3dcbmc,Rakkis157,1 point,Wed Jul 15 04:59:48 2015 UTC,I guess if you're running into perfect set up landos and struggling that much early game its not helpful.
pkmntcg,3dcbmc,Rakkis157,1 point,Wed Jul 15 05:08:05 2015 UTC,"Indeed.  That said, the deck struggles against LandoBats even if they don't have a good setup actually, which is why it is literally the biggest barrier against this deck from being successful. Otherwise, it already rolls over NM, Flareon, Yveltal (still popular back then), M Ray Colorless, Exeggutor and Empoleon, and can break even with Toad, ViriGen and Primal Groudon. Barring the occasional lone Zubat donk, the matchup for LandoBats is more or less 90-10 in their favor, with me having a 2 - 15-20 score against the deck. Vaporeon will change that, at least."
pkmntcg,3dcbmc,Rakkis157,1 point,Wed Jul 15 05:31:43 2015 UTC,"Oh, and btw, Medicham cannot actually utilize Blacksmith accel nor can it hit for weakness even with the Eeveelutions in play. Level Ball will be uber useful here, though."
pkmntcg,3dcbmc,Rakkis157,1 point,Wed Jul 15 04:36:51 2015 UTC,Yea you're right i wrote this off the top of my head i forgot to mention shrine of memories to get STAB. idk why i mentioned blacksmith i probably got it confused with something else that i ended up not mentioning.
pkmntcg,3dcbmc,TheProtagonist2,1 point,Wed Jul 15 04:44:45 2015 UTC,Fair enough.
pkmntcg,3dcbmc,Rakkis157,1 point,Wed Jul 15 04:48:51 2015 UTC,in expanded you could manage  20(base)+30(bangle)+20-80(strong energy)+20(fighting stadium)x2(weakness)x2(barrage)= 360-600 damage lol so theres always that :D.
pkmntcg,3dcbmc,TheProtagonist2,1 point,Wed Jul 15 05:03:50 2015 UTC,"Of course. This is the strongest part of Medicham, which is that if it can hit for weakness, it can take up to 4 Prizes in a single turn."
pkmntcg,3dcbmc,leagueofuchiha,1 point,Wed Jul 15 05:06:44 2015 UTC,"It's actually incapable of hitting for weakness or resistance as the effect of it's attack, though."
pkmntcg,3dcbmc,theultimateabsol,1 point,Wed Jul 15 12:56:28 2015 UTC,"That is what Celebi-EX/Shrine of Memories is there for. You use Meditite's attack, not Medicham's."

pkmntcg,3dd6l7,enochism,1 point,Wed Jul 15 10:07:48 2015 UTC,"I love me some fairies, but with the prominence of Metal in the current meta, I'd say NM is the safer play. It does lose Mew EX next month, but should still be viable post-rotation."

pkmntcg,3dd6l7,cellojake,1 point,Wed Jul 15 12:40:30 2015 UTC,I would just wait until rotation and go vespuqueen or wait on the meta
pkmntcg,3dbk3p,frownfish,1 point,Wed Jul 15 00:15:15 2015 UTC,I play tons of night march but imo it seems pointless to try and keep it working when a pure bee queen deck will be much better with easier knockouts from eeveelutions more draw support from unknown and energy acceleration from blacksmith.
pkmntcg,3dbk3p,DireOwlbear,2,Wed Jul 15 00:24:00 2015 UTC,Still helps people that cannot afford to craft new decks. Recycling NM will let them still do ok at events until they can buy new cards.
pkmntcg,3dbk3p,cellojake,1 point,Wed Jul 15 02:21:58 2015 UTC,"Might be pointless, but I like thinking about ways to keep the archetype around. It will be interesting to see if Bee queen + Eevee takes NM's place in the meta entirely."
pkmntcg,3dbk3p,DireOwlbear,1 point,Wed Jul 15 01:18:40 2015 UTC,Arn't they the same archetype? i'm not trying to be a downer but ive tried the gourgantic/flareon alternatives to nightmarch and the dependance on DCE hurts sooo much especially when you're running shaymins(which are pretty much needed now) that give up two prizes. but w/e works for you.
pkmntcg,3dbk3p,JauntyAngle,1 point,Wed Jul 15 02:51:28 2015 UTC,"I think the number of draw supporters is a tiny bit low. If you are only playing 5 draw supporters (ones that work all the time, so excluding Ace Trainer) I think you may need more than 2 Shaymin EX and 3 trainer's mail. I would look for something like 6 supporters and 4 mail."
pkmntcg,3dbk3p,JauntyAngle,1 point,Wed Jul 15 00:42:01 2015 UTC,"I can agree with that. That was one of my main concerns with this list. Perhaps as Vespiquen serves as an auxiliary a 2-2 would be enough, creating enough space for +1 Mail and +1 Sycamore"
pkmntcg,3dbk3p,jle1076,1 point,Wed Jul 15 01:20:45 2015 UTC,"If you only have 2-2 you might want sacred ash, too. I think with just two of them, there is a significant chance that you can lose them both somehow. E.g. have to discard one and get the other KOd before it can do anything."
pkmntcg,3dbk3p,jle1076,1 point,Wed Jul 15 01:33:50 2015 UTC,"There are 0 reasons to not play 4 sycamore and 4 ultra balls.  Also, why not acrobikes?"
pkmntcg,3dbk3p,cellojake,1 point,Wed Jul 15 03:30:09 2015 UTC,"Acro bikes were cut for the Unown as it serves a similar purpose and advances the goal for Pokemon in the discard.   I am not sure I agree that you need 4 sycamores, but I do agree that the draw supporters are a bit lacking  You are right about the Ultra balls, should probably be 4 Ultra, at the expense of 1-2 Level balls"
pkmntcg,3dbk3p,leagueofuchiha,1 point,Wed Jul 15 03:59:43 2015 UTC,"the reason I say sycamore is so necessary is with 4 ultra balls and ways to search NM pokes, you can play one then dump 3-4 and draw a whole new hand"
pkmntcg,3dbwej,JauntyAngle,3,Wed Jul 15 01:51:53 2015 UTC,"I've had someone claim that Birch is a decent addition in this sort of engine, the reason being that getting a 4 is better for Shaymin while getting a 7 is powerful regardless, especially with all the item draw we have available. Unfortunately for me I can't exactly find the time to test this."
pkmntcg,3dbwej,Rakkis157,1 point,Wed Jul 15 03:13:12 2015 UTC,This is also something I found out when using a delphox engine. The 4 can be turned into 6 while you have a chance of just getting 7 right away.
pkmntcg,3dbwej,zackyd665,1 point,Wed Jul 15 03:34:42 2015 UTC,That's really interesting.
pkmntcg,3dbwej,aqlno,1 point,Wed Jul 15 04:52:46 2015 UTC,"I run a Colorless Ray deck with 2 Sycamore, 1 N, 1 Colress, 4 Shaymin, 4 Ultra Ball, 4 Trainers Mail engine.   I only dead draw maybe 10% of the time and hardly ever have to dump a large hand with sycamore. I'm not sure if that set up can apply to other deck types, but it works really well for me. Might be hard to fit 4 Shaymin in other decks."
pkmntcg,3dbwej,Rakkis157,2,Wed Jul 15 02:26:15 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the info.   Might be hard to fit 4 Shaymin in other decks.   Colorless Ray has a reasonably thick Pokemon line. I think if you can fit 4 into that you can it into a lot of decks. The issue is more likely to be bench space, I think. With non-Skyfield decks it can get a bit cramped."
pkmntcg,3dbwej,shashad,1 point,Wed Jul 15 02:35:25 2015 UTC,Indeed this is the case. Non-Skyfield decks struggle to make use of more than 2 Shaymin from my experience.
pkmntcg,3dbwej,shashad,1 point,Wed Jul 15 03:10:50 2015 UTC,"the reason it seems so much more consistent is because the amount of cards you are dumping.   if you do want to have this, you need a lot of things like trainers mail and ultra balls that you can use real quick so you do't have to worry about what you are throwing away.   if you think about it, if use 4 scy/juniper, and 4-5 cards in your had at all time, that almost 20 cards of your deck you've thrown/gone through."
pkmntcg,3dbwej,The_Strict_Nein,1 point,Wed Jul 15 03:06:22 2015 UTC,"I guess what interests me is how much this can be toned down so that it is less dumpy, but still  very consistent."
pkmntcg,3dbwej,asdjklghty,1 point,Wed Jul 15 04:52:15 2015 UTC,i actually prefer the dumb.  that is why i have cards that can search then dump to get to the stuff i like. plus it kinda helps against item lock
pkmntcg,3d9rok,galaspark,2,Tue Jul 14 16:41:34 2015 UTC,"I'd say Dragalge is almost unnecessary. Your goal is to one shot things, you dont care so much if they can retreat. I might even up Lysandre to 3 so that you can target things easier. 6 stadiums might be overkill too. I can understand steel shelter, but you kinda dont need plant forest. Id drop plant forest and dragalge, up ariados to 3-3, put in a few evosoda and Shaymin EX.  Edit: also dont need so many ultra ball and level ball. Id drop Ultra ball completely and go 4 level ball."
pkmntcg,3d9rok,Tidusblitz111,2,Tue Jul 14 17:04:57 2015 UTC,"Not a bad idea, considering that Dragalge was the only thing making Ultra Ball necessary. But if I don't have Ultra Ball, it will be a lot harder to get Shaymin-EX out. I think I'll make the following changes:  -2 Skrelp  -2 Dragalge  -3 Giant Plant Forest    +1 Lysandre  +2 Shaymin-EX  +2 Ultra Ball  +1 Spinarak  +1 Ariados"
pkmntcg,3d9rok,Tidusblitz111,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:13:16 2015 UTC,"Not +2 ultra ball, you already have 4. That puts you at 6 lol. You'd want 2-3 ultra ball. And if you keep ultra ball, stay at 3 level ball. You might want to put in something that can do a little damage for the grass matchup. As it stands, you instant lose to grass because you cant poison them.  Edit: Rakkis said the perfect one. Spinda. One energy cost, and 10 damage even if they retreat. 2 of those."
pkmntcg,3d9rok,Rakkis157,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:16:58 2015 UTC,"Oh, that's right, I forgot about those. Well, I'll add Spinda instead of Ultra Ball."
pkmntcg,3d9rok,doublesoup,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:03:35 2015 UTC,"It's a lovely deck, and I'll definitely going to try it out once the set hits.  Regarding the deck, yes, Hex Maniac is a must. However, instead of the Dragalge line, I'd add 1-2 Spinda to simply snipe at your opponent's Pokemon if you fail to KO them. With the core being very, very small (Doublade, Ariados and Trick Coin), there is a lot of space for experimentation, so let's look forward to that.  Some things that might be worth trying out is the Flareon AOR Blacksmith combo, Aegislash + Shrine of Memories and perhaps teching in Ancient Trait Pokemon to finish off your opponent's Pokemon."
pkmntcg,3d9rok,Azukola,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:14:58 2015 UTC,"Having a Delta Plus Pokemon to finish something off seems like a good idea. I'm not sure which one to use, though. I'll probably use Swellow since it can do damage with a single DCE."
pkmntcg,3d9rok,LortonMedia,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:19:34 2015 UTC,"I currently have a False Seipe deck I'm adding Swellow to. I like your idea as well and will try it, since I've used lasers with it before."
pkmntcg,3d9rok,Myrtt,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:48:03 2015 UTC,I love how people are already creating decks and completely ignoring the fact of theta stop.  You would be easily crushed by any number of them:  Malamar Golurk Mega Sceptile EX Baltoy Porygon Z
pkmntcg,3d9rok,Rakkis157,1 point,Thu Jul 16 03:55:30 2015 UTC,"I would try a line of Forretress to deal with grass pokemon and maybe 2 special metal energy to resist one Miltank's attack (without the band). Against M Sceptile your only chance is to put down forretress before he mega evolves (basically at turn one), so the FGP could be useful here. Or simply play Faded Town stadium. Let us know about the tests!"
pkmntcg,3d9rok,Tidusblitz111,0,Thu Jul 16 11:05:58 2015 UTC,"I would stick a Mew up front, due to how fragile Doublade is and the fact it needs to evolve. Then I'd drop the Forest of Giant Plants for a Dimension Valley so False Swipe only takes one energy  Drop the metal energy for a mix of maybe rainbow/blend and grass so that you can have a Virizion on the bench to stop yourself getting poisoned rather then going the sparkling robe/steel shelter route. (Virizion takes 1 or 2 spots compared to the 5 you have at the moment, and frees a spot for trick coin)  Also you may wish to get a Fliptini in for some of the Trick Coins and a Jirachi for a T1 wally/fan club  Another completely different route to go would be using the Hyper Fang Raticate as thats a guaranteed knockout."
pkmntcg,3d9rok,Myrtt,2,Tue Jul 14 16:52:24 2015 UTC,"Well, this was for standard. If it were for expanded I would have used Jirachi-EX and Fliptini. But I hadn't thought of Mew or Virizion before, so I do appreciate your input either way."
pkmntcg,3d9pgf,Flumpkins7,5,Tue Jul 14 16:25:58 2015 UTC,"There are several elements that AOR brings into the next format.   Vileplume Item locking M-Sceptiles + Bat resistance + HIGH HP (w/ floette and Sceptile's attack) Girintina EX Special energy + tool + Stadium locking Anti M pokemon supplies Vespiquen hitting for fast damage Volcanora powering up big EXs (Ampharos or Tyranitar) EX deck speed through Hoopa EX The ability to cancel Abilities (and cancel Vileplume) through Hex Maniac Eeveelutions allowing decks to hit enough damage through weakness Flareon giving Stage 1 energy acceleration through blacksmith. Attacking shutoff through malamar promo and confusion Level ball, allowing non EX decks more power Instant poisoning through Ariados Draw power through unown Gigantic stalling with Porygon-Z with slow Beam, enhanced hammer, crushing hammer, and head ringer   That's a lot of stuff to worry about for old decks, but also gives roots to a lot of new decks.  Nationals generated a ton of hype around Wailord EX, Toad, and Bats.  Toad will definitely lose power without Hypnotoxic laser, Garbodor, and Virbank city Gym.  Wailord will lose power without Max Potion and Suicune.    Bats are Questionable.  They will most likely be useless against M-Sceptile decks.  However, M-Sceptile decks are countered by Flareon decks.  Also, Landorus EX, a great partner for bats, is gone, and zubat PLF with free retreat as well.  They do help M-Tyraninitar.  Night march is practically dead without computer search, Mew EX, Jirachi EX, and Empoleon.  Metal will remain strong, but are some ups and downs.  Level ball can help get out Bronzor and Bronzong, Good.  Keldeo EX and Float Stone are gone, bad.  Hoopa EX gets out more Shaymin and M- Raquaza, good.  Klingklang might be rotated out, bad.  Aegislash can now get shut off by one Hex Maniac, bad.  Flareon and Jolteon can help hit for weakness on M-Raquaza, bad.  I might see steel to accelerate other things though, maybe Porygon-Z.  Losing free retreat and having more enemy decks that hit for weakness put steel at a greater disadvantage.  Speaking of Porygon-Z, I do not want to leave that out.  It's Slow-Beam and head ringer can destroy some decks.  If it is accelerated by metal, it's consistently deadly.  However, that's my rogue idea :P  Another thing is fairies.  It loses Max Potion, but gains energy returner.  However, steel might counter it too if it is played.  It doesn't lose that many things though with the rotation.  Fairy tool box could be great too, because it hits for weakness on other things.  First, Shaymin EX is a must have.  That helps almost any and every deck.  Then M-Raqauza is also a good thing to invest in, because it is colorless and fits in other decks.  Unknown would be good to invest in, but it's just a common...  Head ringer will keep being very important, so be sure to get that when you can.  Manectric EX and M-Manectric EX are probably the most reliable things to investing in, because they are very consistent, quick, and are not impacted by rotation.  But, maybe it will be outsped by Sceptile and M-Sceptile, so do heasitate.  Really, I say this set and rotation CHANGES THE ENTIRE META.  Everything is still questionable."

pkmntcg,3d9pgf,MNChino,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:49:48 2015 UTC,"It's not out yet, so it's not good to invest in it.  I find that preorder prices tend to be too high.  Usually for the past few sets, I've found that the prices tend to be low a couple weeks after the preorders (except for Shaymin-EX), but rise once a big tournament happens.  Yes, Girintina is definitely a big possibility in the Meta.  I definitely would consider investing in it myself.  People would find ways to pay that energy cost to attack too.  I would think that Girintina/Vileplume will become a deck."

Is it just speculation about which sets will rotate out, and if so can you explain which and why? Thanks!"
pkmntcg,3d9pgf,MNChino,2,Thu Jul 16 23:26:54 2015 UTC,"Well, my main basis of speculation was that the TCGO announced that it was only selling XY-on things in its card shop soon.  Then, It took some logic to figure its KSS-On.  XY/KSS is a good breaking point, because it is the start of a new generation of pokemon and the introduction of megas.   Next, it would be too generous to have the rotation as PLS- on, because that is only rotating one set.  If you rotate one Plasma set out, all of them would seem to go together and should go at the same time.  LTR-on was speculated, but that would leave a useless pokemon in format, Lugia EX.  It would not have any legal plasma energy.  What also made sure that it wasn't LTR on was that Lugia EX was printed with Mewtwo EX's Attack.  It's pointless to have them both in format at once.  And yes, it was just recently confirmed to be XY/KSS-on, just yesterday, via twitter and the official pokemon website."

pkmntcg,3d9pgf,Ribenar,1 point,Tue Jul 14 23:32:38 2015 UTC,"Gengar's attack poisons the opponent, why are you using Ariados?"
pkmntcg,3d9pgf,nintendonate64,1 point,Tue Jul 14 23:57:44 2015 UTC,1-1 line just in case. or you want to use gengars first attack and still poison. i know it seems odd but i like the idea of it being in there

pkmntcg,3d9pgf,nintendonate64,1 point,Wed Jul 15 02:39:56 2015 UTC,Ariados is going to be used in a lot of things. Machamp EX will probably abuse it the most to hit for even more damage then clear itself of poison. But we shall see
pkmntcg,3d9pgf,Ribenar,1 point,Wed Jul 15 02:56:10 2015 UTC,"I agree, and it will be a strong play there with Machamp-EX.  But for Trevenant/Gengar I don't think it's worth having a 1-1 line just to have poison trigger 1 turn faster...which to even have that happen you would need to use your turn 1 wally for the Ariados when it should be used for Trevenant."

pkmntcg,3d9pgf,Rakkis157,1 point,Tue Jul 14 21:44:03 2015 UTC,It only reduces retreat cost by 2. Trevenant has 3 retreat cost.
pkmntcg,3d9pgf,nintendonate64,1 point,Tue Jul 14 22:44:43 2015 UTC,mystery energy benefits YOU. your opponent unless playing something psychic based (you will also be super effective against) wont have many ways to retreat out of poison without items after rotation
pkmntcg,3d9pgf,aqlno,1 point,Tue Jul 14 22:59:18 2015 UTC,"You're right. I was thinking of a way to retreat the Trevenant from the active for free, which is how Trevenant is frequently played.   But that doesn't even work out either."
pkmntcg,3d9pgf,galaspark,1 point,Wed Jul 15 01:31:53 2015 UTC,"It's hard to say for sure what will emerge as the new meta. I think it will have more to do with rotation than what Ancient Origins will bring to the table. That being said, I think Mega Tyranitar will be huge, especially with support from Bats."
pkmntcg,3d9pgf,TheChildOfKreis,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:30:36 2015 UTC,Personally I don't think M T-Tar will be good it takes too long to set up and can be double head ringered and has the fighting weakness. I feel vespiquen and golurk will be good decks since they can be set up quickly hit for good damage with weakness and even without. And also have a good prize trade.
pkmntcg,3d9pgf,galaspark,2,Tue Jul 14 16:44:10 2015 UTC,It will probably be better in expanded with Dark Patch. Personally I think that the double head ringer isn't an issue since it will probably have a Spirit Link attached anyway.
pkmntcg,3d9pgf,Wolfgirl90,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:49:48 2015 UTC,"True, but the threat is there. That's bad enough. M-Tyranitar has a high enough attack cost that even one Head Ringer would be devastating."
pkmntcg,3d9pgf,asdjklghty,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:19:03 2015 UTC,"Or you're making yourself worry because you don't want M Ty to rise. Seismitoad decks always give a turn of Items, Vileplume means no one can attach Tools and the chance of you having a Heas Ringer in your hand before you evolve or M Ty has 2 Tools attached to it and very low."
pkmntcg,3d9pgf,TheChildOfKreis,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:31:24 2015 UTC,No it just is really vulnerable and slow. I'm not scared. I mean 4 base energy to attack and possibly 6 attack cost is crazy!! Even if it can hit for damage in the thousands it won't matter if a Golurk can ohko it making you have to set up another which will take 3 turns. It will be good when it works but ohko decks will be the death of most megas.
pkmntcg,3d9pgf,asdjklghty,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:14:54 2015 UTC,There's a card called Shadow Circle. Dark decks will definitely run at least 3 soon with their Weakness being a big problem.
pkmntcg,3d9pgf,TheChildOfKreis,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:57:58 2015 UTC,No matter how much I you really want t-tar to be viable it just won't be there is no dark support anymore dark patch and darkrai are both gone and yveltal hasn't been any good in ages. Just it won't be able to compete no matter how strong it is it won't matter if a vespiquen can ohko it because you cant set it up in one turn like raichu vespiquen etc. And shadow circle can easily be taken out with paint roller and another stadium. Im not usually one go call things this early but i don't think it will be teir 1. Also what dark decks are there with darkrai rotating? There isn't a good zoroark and the only good ex is yveltal which now takes a ton of energy if it wants to ohko a mega. The new sableye will help but even then it won't be a miracle card dark decks didn't have before.
pkmntcg,3d9pgf,asdjklghty,0,Tue Jul 14 20:05:54 2015 UTC,"Where did I ever say or hint that it would be Tier 1? I just think as of now it might not be as bad as some think.  Flaws in yo statement/logic:  1)Flareon (excuse me Vespiqueen) can take out anything in one hit. Why should that be a problem against M Tyranitar since he's not the only one to be affected by the bee.  2) Have you been living under a Golum for the past seasons? Yveltal EX has no longer been the OHKO machine it was when it first came out. People have been using it more conservatively to score 2HKOs or finish off Pokemon weakened by M Manectric EX. A simple Turbo Bolt followed up by a 120 Evil Ball ko's most Megas.  3) Every deck will be affected with Paint Roller. Again, that's not a reason to write of M Tyranitar. This card to discard stadiums leads me to...  4) Only Vespiqueen can be set up in one turn. Raichu takes up 2 turns realistically because you won't want to use Wally as your Supporter most of the time. Forest of Giant Plants (yes that's the English name) can be easily discarded by another Stadium or, the card you just mentioned.  5) Mega Turbo replaces Dark Patch. But nice one though."
pkmntcg,3d9pgf,TheChildOfKreis,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:55:27 2015 UTC,1) thanks for supporting my reason  2) I'm aware just its not that good when then meta is ohko's or stalling with item lock.  3) why do you bring up stadiums at first then say they aren't important. But okay.  4) I mean you usually have a pikachu on the bench so it could be set up in one turn but even 2 is faster than a t tar  5) mega turbo will help yes I forgot about that
pkmntcg,3d9pgf,Wolfgirl90,1 point,Tue Jul 14 21:29:03 2015 UTC,"I understand the power of M-Ty. I was actually thinking about pairing it with Flashfire Noivern. After a Boomburst, any Pokemon (including all Megas and Wailord) that can't heal off the damage will be knocked out by Destroyer King.  The problem is that M-Ty is slow. If you get some lucky early hands (both Pokemon, Spirit Link, DCE, Compressor, 2 Mega Turbos), then M-Ty can potentially get going by turn 2. However, this is unlikely since the meta has speed decks and item-lock decks. Seismitoad can get a Quaking Punch off before M-Ty can get on the field, let alone attack. And while some Seismitoad players often give away a turn for items, this is only after they have used multiple Quaking Punches, attached a Ringer or two, and used a few Hammers. Otherwise they are facing pressure from their opponent, which is not something that Tyranitar-EX will be able to do on its own (60 damage for 3 energy is not intimidating). M-Ty doesn't have much in terms of mobility or energy acceleration so anything that can slow it down even a little bit will hurt the deck greatly, particularly since it doesn't have protection against Lysandre like P-Groudon.  I think M-Ty will be viable deck, but its also something that people won't have to try too hard in order to tech against it. Simply being faster will do the trick."
pkmntcg,3d9pgf,aqlno,1 point,Wed Jul 15 01:25:24 2015 UTC,"Will Dark patch remain in expanded? We don't know if expanded will expand to fit the new sets rotating out of Standard, or if it will also experience a rotation at the same time as Standard."

Until then I would wait and buy staple trainers here and there until august when the rotation happens. If you get things such as sycamore and lysander, trainers mail and ultra ball, you will find it cheaper to build decks when the rotation hits. There is still tons to figure out and chances are you will need to buy shaymin ex, but if you buy cards over a longer period of time you will only need to buy pokemons in august. Until then let ptgco quench your thirst for tcg, as there are no more majors until after worlds."

Also, maybe you could take out one supporter in favor of a VS Seeker?  I just usually see decks play at least 3.  4 Crushing Hammers and 1 Enhanced hammer seems a bit inconsistent, because mostly all top decks play double colorless currently.  I haven't played a lock deck though, so I don't know any right balance.  Maybe the Rotation will be KSS or XYon + Next Destinies because they are printing that set again.  And then Zebstrika will be legal in Standard again."
pkmntcg,3dadnd,Rakkis157,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:11:23 2015 UTC,"Hey, thanks for the suggestion regarding an addition VS Seeker! It's always nice to have plenty of them in any given deck, but I opted for 2 this time around (3 would also be nice though!). You're right that 4 Crushing Hammers and 1 Enhanced Hammer doesn't seem all that consistent but it was a bit of a tight fit for me to try and get everything I wanted in the deck.  Where did you hear that they will reprint the Next Destinies set? I wasn't aware of that."

pkmntcg,3d9d5y,Rakkis157,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:01:53 2015 UTC,"Hoopa-EX is a great card that can replace Winona in Colorless M-Ray decks (though I'm not sure if Winona is used in those decks much anyway.) Unlike Shaymin, it has enough health to not be a liability once placed on the Bench. Any EX-heavy deck can make good use of it since you can use Ultra Ball to get three Pokemon now, essentially."
pkmntcg,3d9d5y,galaspark,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:48:33 2015 UTC,"Unknown can provide some good draw power, but take up space.  Really, Hoopa-EX is the only thing to provide easy searching.  Many cards will mill through your deck. I'm going to try to make a swampert deck to compensate for the loss of searching the deck.  However that really isn't a tech."
pkmntcg,3d98gs,enochism,5,Tue Jul 14 14:20:12 2015 UTC,"I will go through a few things first with you:   You need to decide what format your deck will be playing in (Standard, Expanded, Unlimited). Because I am seeing cards from Unleashed here so the deck you have so far is only possible for Unlimited play. If you want to play in other formats you NEED to cut a number of cards to comply with set requirements. I am unsure as to what some of your cards are. Is that Rayquaza-EX from Dragons Exalted (Dragon), Roaring Skies (Dragon), Roaring Skies (Colorless), or XY Promo (Colorless)? I can't tell from names alone so it would be useful to include that information.   Onto the deck itself:   The deck still lacks an overall focus. Good decks usually centers around a strategy and the cards are there to support the strategy. The strategy can be an one-Pokemon show or a synergy between multiple Pokemon, but nevertheless you need to have one to make sure you have a game plan heading into each match-up. There is way too much happening in your deck. I am seeing different lines with no synergy with one another, and the 1-2 Manectric line is just inefficient: With 1 basic Electrike to evolve from, you can only have 1 Manectric at any time, so why would you include an extra Manectric? That extra Manectric will be a dead card at all times in your deck, wasting a valuable space out of 60. Too many 1-of trainers. This is not to say you don't need to have 1-of's - they are often nice utilities to have, but you need to have multiple copies of key cards essential to your strategy in your deck, to ensure that you can play them consistently and still have them available when prized. This is why you see many decks running 4 copies of key cards like N, VS Seeker, Professor Sycamore, Ultra Ball etc. A good deck will be able to pull of what it intends to do consistently, and should minimize luck as much as possible. If this is not yet clear to you: CONSISTENCY IS KEY IN TCG. There's no ultimate, invincible deck, and all decks have a chance of winning even when the match-up doesn't rule in their favour. HOWEVER, If you can't even consistently pull off your strategy most of the time with your deck to begin with, you will most likely lose against a well-organized deck that can get its key Pokemons and trainers out and set-up in a few turns. Resources like SixPrizes's deck discussion forum is a great starting point to get some neat deck ideas. This is not to say to copy their decks piece by piece, or go straight to meta-decks/whatever is popular at the moment.  Rather study the strategies that others have posted, learn about synergies between cards, play test, and soon enough you will find your play style and you can customize your decks accordingly. I for one, like to construct decks with less-explored cards for fun, and for me, this process is possibly the most rewarding part of Pokemon TCG.   Hope this is helpful, and let me know if you have any questions."
pkmntcg,3d98gs,mouselmm,3,Tue Jul 14 15:43:58 2015 UTC,"I can help you a lot better if you can tell me which sets those Pokemon are coming from. Saying ""Zekrom"" tells me nothing when there are four different cards with that same name. This isn't a nit-pick, but rather a requirement for Pokemon deck lists.  I will tell you this though:   Having several one-ofs in a deck is a deck building sin. Your Trainers list lacks consistency because of this.   Interviewer's Questions is useless unless you have energy acceleration (which I can't tell if you do because I don't know precisely which Pokemon you are using) and Cheerleader's Cheer can be substituted for Tierno or Cheren.  If you are using dragon-type Pokemon, then some of that energy can be replaced with Double Dragon Energy (DDE)."

Why are you playing 2 manectrics and only 1 electrike?  energy search is completely pointless to play considering that professor's letter exists, is in standard and is literally twice as good.  Cheren and Tierno really aren't good supporters, especially when you have access to cards like corless, N, sycamore/juniper, shauna and Professor birch's observations.  Cheerleader's cheer is even worse than cheren/tierno, and it along with interviewer's questions aren't even extended-legal"
pkmntcg,3d98gs,hiltzy85,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:33:44 2015 UTC,"I would recommend having more Juniper, since you can draw more cards with it. Discarding cards isn't always something you want to do, but it has to be done at times. Drawing 7 cards is much better than drawing 3, even with the cost of discarding. So I would drop the two Tierno and Cheren for three more Juniper.   You've also got a lot of cards that get energy. Having more Juniper also increases your chances of drawing them naturally. Professor's Letter is, in my opinion, the best energy searching card. Professor Oak's New Theory is a good drawing card, so you can replace some of your other energy searching cards (Energy Search, Cilan, Interviewer's Questions) with more Professor Oak's New Theory.   I should mention that Professor Oak's New Theory (as well as some of your other cards) aren't legal in Standard or Expanded. Standard (also known as Modified) is what most official league tournaments will be, which only allows cards from Boundaries Crossed and newer (so anything older than 2012 isn't legal, unless it was reprinted later.)"

pkmntcg,3da02t,MNChino,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:39:00 2015 UTC,"I'm gonna make a similar deck but I'm using Malamar EX and it's more of a mill deck then anything. Where the main tactic is to keep malamar promo in the active, constantly put the opponent's active to sleep with Malamar EX, and have vileplume so they cant play a switch or whatever can wake up a their active. While they're asleep they can't retreat and they cant attack until they flip a heads or play an item card so it's a perfect fit for malamar p and vileplume. They'll just keep drawing or playing draw supporters until their deck runs out. Hex Maniac really isn't a huge problem as most decks will only run one and after they use it once they wont be able to VS seeker for it back. Your right about AZ, he can be a huge problem but most decks don't even run any so it's definitely not a show stopper.

pkmntcg,3d6w6b,TheChildOfKreis,1 point,Tue Jul 14 07:48:59 2015 UTC,I've updated the format after seeing the concerns - and I have done my best to avoid this happening :)
pkmntcg,3d6w6b,enochism,1 point,Tue Jul 14 14:37:57 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure if I understand Devolution Spray. The phrase ""(That Pokemon can't evolve this turn),"" does it mean that it doesn't work with Broken Time-Space? The current ruling on Rare Candy is that you can't use it on your first turn, even if the Stage 2 has Delta Evolution. So wouldn't the text on Devolution Spray override the text on Broken Time-Space?"
pkmntcg,3d6w6b,enochism,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:34:53 2015 UTC,"Rare candy and Evosoda card text states that they can't be used on first turn, but Devolution Spray only resets the turns the Pokémon has been in play. So, with Broken Time Space you can indeed evolve again, but you still can't use Rare Candy or Evosoda."
pkmntcg,3d6w6b,enochism,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:23:44 2015 UTC,It seems like this deck is completely unbeatable. Whoever uses it will end up winning eventually no matter how unlucky they are with the coin flips since they can use their entire deck over and over again. Or is there actually a way to counter this strategy?
pkmntcg,3d6w6b,mattman222221,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:39:58 2015 UTC,WHAT EVERY SET EVER!?!? YES THANK YOU AYBX SO HYPED FOR THIS!!  Edit: Okay I think there need to be some erratas on some cards like I have energy remover and that automatically removes an energy with no flip and gust of wind is a item lysandre. So I think for some cards to make them not super broken should have an errata.

pkmntcg,3d53fz,Ediamonds2001,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:04:00 2015 UTC,"I got beat in nationals by a good donphan player.  It focused more on donphan than primal Groudon.  If you play it right, it's great at the prize trade.    However, the main problem isn't Lysander's trump card ban, but Seismitoad EX.  Players can use mega turbo to recycle energy onto Primal Groudon, or use Sacred Ash to put donphan back into the deck.  Seismitoad EX hits donphan for weakness, and that is a problem.  I would not advise playing Donphan.  Why?  It might be going out of format, if the rotation is XY-on.  There will be very little tournaments could can use Donphan at.  For now though, it can work competitively."

pkmntcg,3d53fz,MNChino,2,Mon Jul 13 17:36:34 2015 UTC,"I haven't tested them, but they do seem promising.  They might not work well against M-Sceptile EX decks though, but that's going to be a while until you see those, because they're not out yet.  That may be evaluating the meta too far..  Basically, what I see might happen with those decks is that they could fall short in damage, even with bats.  However, I think they're competitively viable.  I just haven't seen them really.  They will survive an XY-on Rotation, if there is one, and that is good."
pkmntcg,3d53fz,YahMoBeThere1,1 point,Mon Jul 13 17:51:23 2015 UTC,"I run batsmane and its my go to deck. I lose decent pieces like jirachi ex and plasma zubat to rotation, but the deck still functions perfectly without them. I'm just torn on which engine I want to run with it, shaymin with skyfields engine, or standard draw engine with silent lab  I personally find batsmane better than landybats because manectric has a great secondary attack. You can OHKO 180hp pokes on turn 2 fairly easily with a good turn 1 setup."
pkmntcg,3d53fz,KingInTheWest,1 point,Mon Jul 13 18:11:47 2015 UTC,What were you playing that you got beat by Donphan? I took it to Canadian Nats and got twisted by evey deck I played except for a poorly made Flareon.
pkmntcg,3d63a7,kalebcook13,3,Mon Jul 13 20:32:18 2015 UTC,"Honestly, that depends on what you need and what you want to get from the set. I will preface this by saying that getting singles of what you need to build decks will be cheaper and easier. But I digress...  Anyway, if you want a box that will hold your stuff, okay sleeves, some dice, and a good deal on 8 packs, then the ETB is good for you. Booster boxes are good if you want to get a bunch of cards from the set as quickly as possible since the odds are in your favor. With 36 packs per box, and a guaranteed rare in every pack, you might get a bunch of stuff that you are looking for.  HOWEVER, the problem with booster boxes is that, like packs, you have no guarantee that you will get anything worthwhile; there is a chance, as small as it is, that you might end up with 36 regular holofoils. This issue isn't that much of a problem with the ETB since it is cheaper.  Personally, I might get a booster box. The ETB is great, but for double the money, I can quadruple the amount of packs I get and I really don't need anymore boxes, dice, or sleeves (I use Dragon Shield anyway). :P"
pkmntcg,3d63a7,Wolfgirl90,1 point,Tue Jul 14 00:28:51 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the detailed response! I think I'm going with the booster box since this is a gift and I wouldn't normally do this. Also, as a beginning player, I feel like good rares k won't use may help me trade at league and get stuff I do need."
pkmntcg,3d63a7,asdjklghty,1 point,Tue Jul 14 01:20:20 2015 UTC,I'd say a booster box. It has many more packs than ETB and you can get better sleeved a dice elsewhere.
pkmntcg,3d63a7,enochism,0,Tue Jul 14 00:44:18 2015 UTC,Na Man i'd just get a ETB. Booster Boxes arnt worth it unless you're collecting or making a deck from that set
pkmntcg,3d63a7,cellojake,0,Mon Jul 13 20:36:32 2015 UTC,"You will ""lose money"" most the time on boxes, but if its for the enjoyment of opening packs I do not see why you shouldnt."
pkmntcg,3d49oj,Choczy,5,Mon Jul 13 12:05:45 2015 UTC,"Go with the battle arena decks. It's a good deck to get into the game, and are fairly decent. It is quite literally suggested to more or less everyone who wants to start out."
pkmntcg,3d49oj,Rakkis157,2,Mon Jul 13 12:10:30 2015 UTC,"Seconded. The Xerneas/Yveltal Battle Arena set is the best pair of theme decks currently available.  And, if you enjoy the game and want to become more competitive, the trainers from the two decks can be combined to give you many of the staple cards in every meta deck.  Have fun!"
pkmntcg,3d49oj,onemonkey,1 point,Mon Jul 13 12:35:00 2015 UTC,"Thirded.   That's a great starter box for 2 players like this, and will give you a very good start to two deck types you seem to like. And then I would focus on buying XY, Flash Fire, and Phantom Forces packs to supplement more trainers and pokemon to support the types you like with current cards.   Then once you get something you like, your local league and can help you edit what you get into a deck, then branch out and try other new types, and then sell your car and buy a booster box, or 5, depending on the car. And really get into it. After that realize that you can never been with someone who likes Fairy Types, because damn max potion, and then break up with her, find a nice water type trainer girl and live happily ever after.   So yeah, the Battle Arena's a good place to start."

Argh, no. Buying boosters, or even whole booster boxes, is an incredibly ineffective way of getting full sets of trainers. You get your staple trainers and desired Pokemon by ordering singles. Boosters are mainly for fun."
pkmntcg,3d49oj,JauntyAngle,1 point,Tue Jul 14 04:28:03 2015 UTC,"i started a few months ago i bought a theme deck and then bought a bunch of packs and a few of those Elite Trainer Boxes but didn't get anything good i went to a local store to play with other people but you will get wrecked since almost everyone had pretty good decks, so i just watched some youtube videos and looked at some of the decks the pro's where using and just bought single cards... waaaay cheaper to do that.  if you want a good deck it's gonna be about $100-$180, but i don't have friends to play with and have to rely on the local store to play so if it's just gonna be you and your girl then i would get the battle arena decks"
pkmntcg,3d49oj,icebear518,1 point,Mon Jul 13 14:47:35 2015 UTC,"First of all, welcome to Pokemon TCG!  From what you are saying I would say Battle Arena Xerneas vs. Yveltal would be a great starting point: It's a fairy vs. deck battle deck that's ready to play, and you get a bunch of neat staple trainers to use in your later decks.  One thing to note is that while fairies are perfectly viable, it is weak to the very popular metal decks at the moment."
pkmntcg,3d49oj,mouselmm,1 point,Mon Jul 13 15:25:55 2015 UTC,Get the battle arena set. I bought it to play with my daughters. Be prepared to be whooped by the fairies though. I do believe the fairy side of the deck is much stronger.

pkmntcg,3d49oj,kalebcook13,0,Tue Jul 14 00:06:20 2015 UTC,what I always recommend is wait until rotation so you don't soon to be unplayable cards
pkmntcg,3d5tb7,Choczy,2,Mon Jul 13 19:23:38 2015 UTC,"All of the Darkrai EX cards from any of the Black and White sets or promos are legal in our current standard rotation.  Also, the XY 22 Promo Darkrai, which came with Phantom forces triple blisters, is legal.  If the next rotation, which should happen in a few months, if any, is XY-on or KSS-on, the Darkrai promo should still stay legal, but Darkrai EX will not stay legal."
pkmntcg,3d64l3,enochism,2,Mon Jul 13 20:41:24 2015 UTC,"The Gyarados and Pikachu are too worn to make it worthwhile, and the Groudon will be worth $30 max if it comes back as a PSA10, so no to that too. I don't think tin promos are worth doing either"
pkmntcg,3d3upb,FlowLink,2,Mon Jul 13 08:37:05 2015 UTC,"I think night march deck is one strong deck, while it's cheap."
pkmntcg,3d3upb,Coconutt0,2,Mon Jul 13 09:00:13 2015 UTC,"One of the best t1 decks that is also pretty budget is Primal Groudon/Wobbufet, one of the few decks that doesn't get strictly better with Shaymin ex (which is 30 bucks on its own).   The other upside is that's it's pretty resilient to rotation, so thats also less of a factor."
pkmntcg,3d3upb,PhatSoxx,1 point,Mon Jul 13 09:27:44 2015 UTC,"Primal Groudon is a great deck (a bit more expensive than night march as others suggest), and it does its job very well right now. The problem I see with it though, is with the new set coming just around the corner, there will be a TON of grass decks popping up for a while. whether or not any of them will be good or not is to be seen, but while they're still ""new and cool"", groudon will struggle because of the grass weakness."
pkmntcg,3d3upb,Wilheladys,1 point,Mon Jul 13 11:20:36 2015 UTC,"With the Wobbafet version, you are passing the first few turns anyway. So you can evolve without a spirit link, and put weakness policy on. I've been running a muscle band, two hard charms and a weakness policy and it's been working great.   Still going to be a drag, though."
pkmntcg,3d3upb,JauntyAngle,1 point,Mon Jul 13 12:24:32 2015 UTC,I think expansion will kill the deck though. Post ao will be very hard on Groudon decks.

Speaking of that train of thought, Night March shouldn't be mentioned since Mew EX might be rotated out soon. Make up your minds people.  For ""XY-On"", Medicham is a descent budget deck (you'll only lose Celibi but its pretty useful, not a bad investment).  If you want an alternative to M Ray, the best would be to stock up on a bunch of the Shiftry (Flashfire) line and Skyfield. Shiftry's attack does 20 times the number of Benched Pokemon in play.  Wobbuffet/Groudon  Wobbufet/Bats  LatiBats  M Gallade/Bats  SeismiBats (yes the Toad's price has dropped)"

You don't need a lot of energy with dimension valley  It's not that hard, put dmg on their active pokemon with the bats then finish them with wobbuffet.

When he does his deck analysis he usually just read the text of the card and says ""... for 80, so that's cool"" or ""... you opponent's Pokemon, so that's really cool"". That's it.

Some decks take it a step further and don't even run Energy Cards, but the general consensus is that you need at least 30 Trainers in your deck (though some can and do go slightly lower), with a good number of them (8-10) being a mix of Professor Sycamore, N, Colress, Shauna and Birch, in order of importance, except for special circumstances.  From here: http://www.pokemon.com/us/play-pokemon/nationals/2015/decks/masters/  In the US Nationals Top 8 for Masters, the deck ratios for Pokemon, Trainers and Energy are, from top to bottom:   10 - 43 - 7 7- 53 - 0 18 - 31 - 11 14 - 37 - 9 12 - 36 - 12 17 - 35 - 8 22 - 28 - 10 20 - 30 - 10"

The EX, rare, and Mega Evolution cards didn't cane with the offer. At first, I was like, ""None of those are included? It's alright. I can go without them.""

First the consistency and now this? I really needed help with this... What has happened to this TCG? I thought every TCG has an originality, but turns out that everyone uses the same deck! Same goes for the video games. I love to use my favorite Pokémon, but my favorites always turn out to be garbage and useless. Sorry about blabbing out much. I wanted to try something new... Could you help me out here? I read and watch tutorials online, but they don't help out much. Again, sorry...I'm such a crybaby sometimes."
pkmntcg,3d2d7i,Rakkis157,3,Mon Jul 13 01:03:23 2015 UTC,"Most decks have strategy and consistency. the reason you think every deck is not original is because the best original decks make it through.  Players see what does well in the current meta and either try to join it or build something to beat it. Ross Cawthorne is a great example. He saw that many players ran more supporters due to seismitoad (a popular item lock pokemon) and ran a supporter lock deck with a pokemon we have never scene do well in tournaments. This tcg has a lot of originality, it just takes experience to see where the meta is going and what should do well. The people who cannot decide go with something they have seen or practiced before, which leads you to think everyone uses the same decks. There is a rare time that the top 8 players are running the exact same decklists. Even just recently at us nationals a brand new deck got second place! (wailord ex.)  Players do flock towards powerful cards because that is consistency, if you can utilize your strategy 9/10 times but your opponent can only do it 5/10 times, you will most likely do better than him during swiss. Decks that have less reliable ideas or more cards that can counter it just do not do as well. There are times they break the odds, but  other times they just never get going. I hope this answered your question, if not ask me what is confusing and I can explain in a new way.   edit: I do not see this deck doing very well, but if you have fun playing it (and do not mind occasionally losing just because the opponent has a more consistent/powerful deck) then to hell with everyone. Have a blast! If loosing frustrates you more than not using your favorite pokemon, you might want to reconsider your decklist before purchasing cards. I will say that it is not the worst idea as a first deck because a lot of the cards are cheap, and the more expensive ones will be the trainers which you will use in other decks. I personally will rate this a 2/10, but just looking at your trainer cards and energy I would say somewhere between a 5-7 out of 10."
pkmntcg,3d2d7i,Rakkis157,2,Mon Jul 13 03:40:02 2015 UTC,"It's hard to say when not using your favorite Pokémon could help you win matches and vice-versa. I think I know why most players I talked to say that competitive play is no longer fun anymore. One minute, you through out your favorite 40HP Shinx, and in the next minute...BOOM! Your Shinx was overkilled by a 240HP Mega EX Pokémon that deals like 130 damage. I think competitive is just a mode when players fight to win and nothing else...  Anyway thanks for the tip and your rating. Gladly appreciate it."

pkmntcg,3d2z3d,831_you,2,Mon Jul 13 02:48:18 2015 UTC,"This is the decklist I've been working on so far. I've kinda been prepping for post-rotation though because I haven't physically gotten any cards to play (I play online for now, still new). But I've been checking on TCGplayer and all these cards usually end up coming out to be around $100, which is pretty damn cheap if you ask me.  Pokemon: 16 3x Xerneas 3x Spritzee 3x Aromatisse 2x Garevoir EX 2x M Gardevoir EX 1x Regirock 1x Manectric EX 1x Aegislash EX  Supporter: 12 4x Wally 3x Professor Juniper 2x Lysander 2x Shauna 1x Xerosic   Item: 19 4x Ultra Ball 3x Enhanced Hammer 2x Gardevoir Spirit Link 2x Super Scoop Up 2x Muscle band 2x VS Seeker 2x Head Ringer 1x Startling Megaphone 1x Energy Retrieval   Stadium: 3 3x Fairy Garden  Energy: 10 10x Fairy Energy"
pkmntcg,3d2z3d,Nikkonikkorice,2,Mon Jul 13 03:23:49 2015 UTC,"Aromatisse is not so essential that you need 4 Wally. Maybe 1 or 2, if that. You definitely also want more draw support, starting with maximizing your Sycamore count.  Since you're looking XY-on, there's not a lot of great draw supporters. Shauna and Birch are ok, and I'm guessing most lists will include 1 Ace Trainer and 1 Teammates after we lose computer search along with N and Colress. Losing those supporters is part of why Shaymin is getting so expensive.   4 VS Seeker is nearly a rule, too.   Also, Manectric doesn't do you much good if you aren't running any rainbow energy."
pkmntcg,3d2z3d,onemonkey,1 point,Mon Jul 13 11:27:50 2015 UTC,Oh yeah there's suppose to be some rainbow energy in there as well. Sorry I forgot to update it. I have 4 Wally's because I assumed I could use it on Gardevoir as well.

pkmntcg,3d17un,TheProtagonist2,2,Sun Jul 12 21:01:01 2015 UTC,"You are playing a ballsy game, having 6 draw supporters and 4 VS Seeker. I would cut two VS Seeker for two draw supporters. Then I would cut two other cards for 2 more draw supporters.  10 or bust IMO.  I really like Dimensional Valley in this deck. I think that if your plan is to hit for weakness all the time, you probably don't need Fighting Stadium. 120*2 is most likely enough."
pkmntcg,3d17un,TheProtagonist2,1 point,Sun Jul 12 23:37:48 2015 UTC,I don't think it needs a ton of draw and I rarely ever use 10 draw supporters that just seems insanely high. If you were making it budget then I could see adding more supporters cutting the vs since vs seekers are 5 bucks a pop but I'm looking for playability. If vileplume is huge I might also cut down on vs but if its not im going to keep using 3-4 in every deck because its so useful. Also I forgot about dimension valley so I'll probably cut one or something else for it! I was making this deck at 2 AM so I wasn't thinking about a lot of stuff lol.
pkmntcg,3d17un,Asclepius24,2,Sun Jul 12 23:49:41 2015 UTC,"Its not budget.  4 out of 9 games. That's how many games you start without a draw support at 6 supporters.  At 10 draw support you are looking at 1 out of 4 games without draw support.  Not to mention the amount of item lock out there.  Edit: Rereading this it came off harsher than I wanted it. I just think VS Seeker is overvalued. It's an amazing card, but it's a supplement to supporters, not a strict replacement, I guess.  This changes with cards like battle compressor and whatnot."
pkmntcg,3d17un,Rakkis157,0,Mon Jul 13 00:17:11 2015 UTC,Well if that's how you want to make your decks go ahead I'm not stopping you. Just for me having 4 extra supporters just makes my hand clunky and I don't like having 4 supporters sitting in my hand when I can only use one its just useless to me. If I have less I can vs seeker them out when I need them rather than have them building up in my hand.
pkmntcg,3d17un,Rakkis157,3,Mon Jul 13 00:26:20 2015 UTC,"The idea is to play ~10 draw Supporters so that you have at least one consistently. You can throw one away with an Ultra Ball or shuffle one back in with a Birch or something, but a hand without a draw Supporter is a bad day. Look at just about any competitive deck and you'll see that's the general build.  Your deck may work well the way it's constructed now, but it would work better with more draw."
pkmntcg,3d17un,bradon_,0,Mon Jul 13 01:22:33 2015 UTC,"Why Grass Energies? Since you are using Golurk that eats any energy, and have Flareon, might as well go with Fire Energies + a Blacksmith or two.  Edit: I didn't see your post about Leafeon previously, so my bad.  That said, I don't feel that Leafeon is worth it, since stuff like the Primals and Wailord EX are still away from OHKO range, and the only thing you can OHKO are Keldeo EX, who will rotate, Huntail, who dies to Golurk's normal attacks, Hippowdon, who is KO'd by 1 Strong or 1 Muscle Band and well, that is all I can think of. I'd say that it might be more worth your while to tech in a Vespiquen or two instead."

pkmntcg,3d2ilh,Ranor,2,Mon Jul 13 00:23:42 2015 UTC,"Forretress  from Flash Fire places a damage counter on each of your opponent's Pokemon when you play it, so you don't even need to use a turn to attack to set up Unwavering Blade. You might want to see if it works better for you than Golbat."
pkmntcg,3d2ilh,galaspark,1 point,Mon Jul 13 03:22:10 2015 UTC,"I think you have way to many pokemon lines. In a physical tournament you will probably deal with having many key cards prized, which is good you have town map. I think the  stadium choice could be improved on, unless you need that hp to avoid a specific counter. Maybe removing abilities with the stadium would be more helpful to slow down shaymin decks. I would replace the great balls. Level ball returns in the format which will help you a lot. Also, you do not need mega turbo. Run skyla (returning as a promo) to reliably find town map and other things. You will also need to put in some vs seeker. This lets you discard things such as wally or skyla with an ultraball and get it back from the discard at any time. You could lose a copy of fan club for it, 2 is not enough if you desire it on the opening hand and you have no room for 4.     Sorry kind of rambling. You need to cut some cards to increase consistency as with this many pokemon lines you need to sacrifice certain things to increase consistency. Cut reporter, cut mega turbo, cut 2-4 energy or cut 2 energy and 1 prof letter. Level ball, skyla, ultra balls, and a must have (3-4 vs seeker) will really help this deck. Like i said above, cutting vs seeker will let you thin out certain cards with ultra balls and reliably get it later on. If you discard a wally and a birch you can pick which one u need with vs seeker, almost like a 2-1 card. This works for all supporters you use/discard.    oh another REALLY important card (rambling still) sacred ash. You cannot be afraid to juniper and lose that evolution you need later. Running sacred ash ruins the possibility of a dead hand (with a supporter) with the exception if sacred ash is also in the hand. But this is a much rarer scenario than without one.   I rambled a lot (just got home exhausted) but feel free to ask questions and I will respond later."
pkmntcg,3d2ilh,cellojake,1 point,Mon Jul 13 03:33:18 2015 UTC,"What are the Nidoqueen and Scolipede lines designed to do?  They don't seem to contribute to your goal of splashing damage everywhere or setting up M Gallade, and with only one of each, you'll have to either be very lucky, expend a lot of resources, or both to get them set up.  I'd drop them for more bats.  Makes it easier to get Golbat out, and if you don't have a turn to spend attacking with Golbat, you can always splash damage around with its ability.  Also, have you considered using Dimension Valley instead of Training Center?  It would decrease your energy needs quite a bit."
pkmntcg,3d20ru,exxtrooper,2,Sun Jul 12 21:54:59 2015 UTC,"I do not have a list,  but it would work by spreading damage around the enemy bench somehow (bats other bench attacks) then using dusknoir to put enough damage on the active to oneshot it with wobbufet. I personally have never seen it but It sounds managable."
pkmntcg,3d20ru,cellojake,1 point,Sun Jul 12 21:58:57 2015 UTC,"its a fun concept, but doesn't work in the current format.  I  had it going as fast as you can with a 2-2-2 line, m gallade to get a lot of damage to move around.  it just can't run as fast as the top decks unless their bench is full, it sadly doesn't do enough damage.    if you do play and win the first game, they know only to keep one or two pokes on their bench at a time so you can't spread the damage"

That's the kind of report I like to read - analysis of your deck and why you chose it, what worked and what didn't, good match reports, and a deck list ;)  Really like how much detail you went into in choosing the deck. This is always a tough choice even for experienced players and this type of detailed explanation is really useful for newer players to read.  The match reports were great. A good report includes the details on what worked and what didn't without any salt ;) Reports like yours are good for analysing deck matchups as well as showing players how to learn and improve their game from wins AND losses. As a Pokédad, I'm always trying to get my kids to learn from what didn't work and examples like these are great.  Sorry to hear you didn't get your invite.

pkmntcg,3cxnu5,nilness,1 point,Sat Jul 11 22:06:40 2015 UTC,Thank you for the feedback and it's nice to hear from you! I hope to keep working on the blog this year so hopefully you will keep reading!
pkmntcg,3cxnu5,mrogersj5,3,Sun Jul 12 02:06:27 2015 UTC,That was a GREAT report! Congrats on making day 2!
pkmntcg,3cxnu5,JauntyAngle,2,Sat Jul 11 19:59:41 2015 UTC,"Thanks! It was a nice end to the season with a deck I had been using for most of it.  This is a really cool subreddit also. I'm subscribed, I plan on posting and commenting more here as well!"
pkmntcg,3cxnu5,Lobsterquadrille12,2,Sat Jul 11 20:39:28 2015 UTC,Great article.   I've been a fan of your site since Andrew Wamboldt linked to your article about Night March. Good stuff.
pkmntcg,3cxnu5,mrogersj5,1 point,Sun Jul 12 02:01:38 2015 UTC,"Thanks u/JauntyAngle! A big thanks is in order to you as well because you linked to one of my articles on this subreddit approximately 27 days ago. That was what tipped me off that this might be a good place to post things, so thanks for sharing that! It's a really cool feeling to write something and have other people share it.  So thanks again!"
pkmntcg,3cz6re,luisrey6,5,Sun Jul 12 02:53:48 2015 UTC,"Just a heads up if you didn't know this: the cards in there are different from those in packs with backs, borders, and signatures for the WC decks. I don't think these sell for much graded. Each deck cost like $15 retail so there's not much value in them."
pkmntcg,3cz6re,Asclepius24,5,Sun Jul 12 03:11:43 2015 UTC,"Can confirm. Any of those cards, even if it is a super duper rare card worth a lot of money, has little to no value because of the signature or because of the backing."
pkmntcg,3cz6re,BiteSizedUmbreon,1 point,Sun Jul 12 03:21:37 2015 UTC,"alright cool, yeah i knew the value went down because of that. Think Im better off just selling the case to get rid of it all at once, thanks!"
pkmntcg,3cz6re,BiteSizedUmbreon,1 point,Sun Jul 12 03:26:32 2015 UTC,No problem; there are definitely people interested in collecting those things and a whole case may catch someones' eye. Good luck :D
pkmntcg,3cz6re,TheChildOfKreis,1 point,Sun Jul 12 04:03:41 2015 UTC,Are those cards legal for tournament play (of course the ones that are still in format) or because they are from the sets are they not.
pkmntcg,3cz6re,Hukutus,1 point,Sun Jul 12 15:21:20 2015 UTC,WC deck cards are not legal since that would make the real cards worthless. They also have different backs and different borders.

pkmntcg,3d045x,enochism,2,Sun Jul 12 10:32:55 2015 UTC,"As long as you shuffle sufficiently, re ordering cards in a deck while searching the deck is not in and of itself illegal by the rulebook.   However, a serious shuffle must be done and if I saw my opponent reordering cards, I'd shuffle his deck myself afterwards or ask a Judge to come over and shuffle."
pkmntcg,3d045x,The_Strict_Nein,1 point,Sun Jul 12 12:05:11 2015 UTC,Are you sure about this? I thought that last year before worlds they changed the ruling to absolutely no arranging your deck -_-?
pkmntcg,3d045x,Poketann,1 point,Sun Jul 12 18:24:11 2015 UTC,I thought that as well.
pkmntcg,3d045x,cellojake,1 point,Sun Jul 12 19:41:59 2015 UTC,"In essence, the contents of the deck is unknown to the game, including the order of the cards.  It's a technicality. Stacking cards and not shuffling or shuffling poorly is definitely against the rules. But splitting up your 4 DCE then doing 7 riffle shuffles and a bunch of overhands? You'll be fine.  Lastly, there is nothing (to my knowledge) specifically in the rules about rearranging cards, AS LONG AS you shuffle your deck sufficiently afterwards. As such, if the Head Judge/Judge decides that they are not allowing any form of rearranging, you may get a Caution and be asked not to rearrange again if you prove you shuffle sufficiently. But you probably wouldn't face any kind of formal Warning/Penalty."
pkmntcg,3d045x,The_Strict_Nein,0,Sun Jul 12 21:30:15 2015 UTC,Thanks Professor!
pkmntcg,3d045x,Sir_Selah,1 point,Sun Jul 12 12:14:31 2015 UTC,If you're sufficiently randomizing your deck why would you arrange it beforehand?
pkmntcg,3d045x,Sir_Selah,1 point,Mon Jul 13 14:16:32 2015 UTC,Better Energy Ratio i guess
pkmntcg,3d045x,Darth_Mail,1 point,Mon Jul 13 14:23:40 2015 UTC,That doesn't answer anything though.   A fully randomized deck will leave you with bad hands from time to time. That's how randomization works.  http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v733/Cybron/c051qo8.gif

pkmntcg,3cwtyq,JauntyAngle,1 point,Sat Jul 11 14:47:02 2015 UTC,It only blocks effects of abilities on the Pokémon with the ancient trait. Meaning it won't prevent Giratina's ability but the pokémon with the trait will be able to hit Pyroar even if it's a basic or hit any Safeguard pokémon even if it's an EX. It can also block Garbodor's ability.
pkmntcg,3cwtyq,Sweetchat34,3,Sat Jul 11 14:02:54 2015 UTC,"Incorrect.   The wording of Theta Stop is that it blocks abilities ""applied to this Pokemon"". However, Safeguard and Intimidating Mane are not applied to the attacking Pokemon, but the defending Pokemon. As such, Theta Stop does not neutralise Safeguard style effects.   Removed the bit about Garbodor, however no Theta Stop pokemon have abilities to my knowledge."
pkmntcg,3cwtyq,The_Strict_Nein,2,Sat Jul 11 14:07:03 2015 UTC,Malamar has one. It causes any coins flipped by your opponent while it is active to count as tails. It's a promo IIRC.
pkmntcg,3cwtyq,Rakkis157,1 point,Sat Jul 11 14:53:53 2015 UTC,Malamar is a beast
pkmntcg,3cwtyq,Azukola,1 point,Sat Jul 11 21:25:18 2015 UTC,Theta Stop Golurk also has an ability.
pkmntcg,3cwtyq,Indigo-2184,1 point,Sat Jul 11 22:49:39 2015 UTC,I think the biggest thing is that it will prevent damage from bats (Crobat/Golbat sneaky bite)

Instead of getting super salty he's excited to play against something totally different, even though he's most likely already lost!   To me that's what the pokemon community is about, and I feel like people get so caught up in winning that they forget that this is a game and it supposed to be about having fun!"
pkmntcg,3ctnm3,aqlno,4,Fri Jul 10 18:23:36 2015 UTC,"Yep, I agree completely with you! I love facing new decks, and rogue decks as well - especially when they are well-built. Thank you for your insightful opinion :)."
pkmntcg,3ctnm3,Rakkis157,1 point,Fri Jul 10 18:26:11 2015 UTC,Just finished the video! That second game was really awesome. Didn't expect camerupt to be able to OHKO a wailord.   It's unfortunate that you didn't draw into any other pokemon as you definitely would have won if that was the case.   Did you record these before or after US nationals last weekend? I'm curious if the cat was out of the bag and these people just don't pay attention to the IRL PTCG scene or if this was still a relatively unknown deck at that point.
pkmntcg,3ctnm3,Rakkis157,1 point,Fri Jul 10 18:48:10 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I typically record my videos well in advance. This Wailord EX deck I had built was about 1-2 weeks prior to them being revealed at the US Nationals as one of the Top 8 decks, so this strategy wasn't too well know. Now they're pretty rampant in the PTCGO due to how well it performed, so I doubt I'd get the same reactions when using my Wailord Mill deck."
pkmntcg,3ctnm3,do_you_even_loaft,1 point,Sat Jul 11 18:32:56 2015 UTC,The standard reaction for Wailord nowadays is a lot of rage. It's too bad they did not give my deck a chance though. Most of the players I've met so far actually enjoyed my deck.
pkmntcg,3ctnm3,NintendoNerd16,2,Sat Jul 11 18:47:07 2015 UTC,And it looks like one of those 'salty people' just dropped by and downvoted the thread. :(

I would LOVE to have something like that."
pkmntcg,3cqw6h,enochism,2,Fri Jul 10 07:03:40 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that sounds great. Creating winning/popular decks that anyone can clone would definitely be fun!  I think card/decl stats would also be cool. Like VS Seeker is in 80% of all decks, etc."
pkmntcg,3cryzd,funny-original-name,2,Fri Jul 10 08:06:36 2015 UTC,Might as well use Landorus EX. You might be able to do something with Archie's Gredninja alongside it tho.
pkmntcg,3cryzd,Rakkis157,2,Fri Jul 10 08:59:02 2015 UTC,"I think that using both Greninja and Crobat is redundant. But adding a 3-3-2 Crobat line or Archie's engine and a couple of Greninja could be a cool addition to an already existing deck to add some extra damage.   I've seen the Crobat line paired with Landorus EX, Seismitoad EX, or even Raichu XY, and at MO States I played against an Exeggutor deck with Archie's/Greninja in it.   Good luck!"
pkmntcg,3crr5n,Fox_McButt,8,Fri Jul 10 06:24:01 2015 UTC,"Well, you only get 8 packs, I think, so even if a set has good staples in it, there is every chance you won't get any of them.  That being said, Phantom Forces contains VS Seeker. It's a 3 of or 4 of in just about every deck, and is one of the more expensive staples (around $4 per card)."
pkmntcg,3crr5n,JauntyAngle,2,Fri Jul 10 06:27:24 2015 UTC,"Second for Phantom Forces, aside from VS Seeker (which is essential) there are also good cards that can get your value back. For me the highlight is Head Ringer, which is excellent in an EX-heavy game. Trump Card is now banned though :(  Plus, almost all the EX and M-Evolutions are seeing decent play around!"
pkmntcg,3crr5n,mouselmm,2,Fri Jul 10 14:11:17 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the set has Gengar and Manectirc. Also Florges, which is quite useful.   And robosubs! Not needed in every deck, but a great, great trainer."
pkmntcg,3crr5n,JauntyAngle,2,Fri Jul 10 23:56:56 2015 UTC,don't forget battle compressor
pkmntcg,3crr5n,hiltzy85,3,Sat Jul 11 18:54:02 2015 UTC,An etb wont necessarily give you any staples besides a good handful of energies and some dice (but even the smaller dice arent enough for damage counters) unless you pull them from the packs.  Your probably better off buying them outright. Ebay has people selling lots of 4x each card in one auction. Compare the total cost to what stores on tcgplayer.com are selling singles for x4.
pkmntcg,3crr5n,Credits_PTCGO,2,Fri Jul 10 13:37:20 2015 UTC,"You could also wait to buy the Ancient Origins ETB that comes out in a couple months and just start off with one of the Roaring Skies starter decks for now, I would recommend Aurora Blast over Storm Rider."
pkmntcg,3crr5n,mateo1time,1 point,Fri Jul 10 06:34:33 2015 UTC,"Hmm, I just checked the decklist for aurora blast, the only decent cards it seems to come with are professor's letter, winona and maybe pokemon center lady. Am I missing more?"
pkmntcg,3crr5n,Redados,2,Fri Jul 10 06:45:18 2015 UTC,I would avoid theme decks! Buying singles online will save you money in the long run over packs and theme decks. Plus you don't even get the thrill of opening a pack when you buy a theme deck!

pkmntcg,3crr5n,aipom45,1 point,Sat Jul 11 16:43:18 2015 UTC,Ultra ball I think.
pkmntcg,3crr5n,aipom45,1 point,Fri Jul 10 06:54:40 2015 UTC,"True, it comes with 1 believe. Probably not worth it still though."
pkmntcg,3crr5n,mateo1time,1 point,Fri Jul 10 06:55:37 2015 UTC,Yeah probably not.
pkmntcg,3crr5n,asdjklghty,1 point,Fri Jul 10 07:14:04 2015 UTC,"I meant it more in sense of which is better out of those 2, I didn't mean it as the best starter deck out right now, there's better ones out there, but I figured you wanting to stick to Roaring Skies since it's the most recent."
pkmntcg,3crr5n,asdjklghty,2,Fri Jul 10 07:30:40 2015 UTC,"Phantom Forces I guess since you seem to be in the boat of ""XY-on! I don't want to get cards that will get rotated out""  Honestly doing that right now outside of testing, is useless. We aren't in a new format yet so playing without the staples hurts big time. Trust me. I've tried only XY-on and it sucks. Really, you should just wait and see. And prices for many cards like N have dropped so they aren't that expensive anyways. Ace Trainer looks to replace it but that will come in the future, not now."
pkmntcg,3crr5n,Atgarnett,1 point,Fri Jul 10 12:43:03 2015 UTC,"I have a good amount of cards from black and white, and I'll still keep the staples from the black and white sets, but I'm trying to prepare for the future by selling as many cards that are going to be rotated as I can. IIRC worlds is the only tournament left in this format."
pkmntcg,3crr5n,Ribenar,1 point,Fri Jul 10 18:09:36 2015 UTC,That's still a long way.
pkmntcg,3crr5n,Azukola,1 point,Fri Jul 10 20:53:39 2015 UTC,"I feel like it's not worth it to invest in more cards that are getting rotated in about a month. Are there any other smaller tournaments before worlds? If not, I'd just be buying cards for league and stuff. I'll still use the cards I have but I don't think it's a good idea to buy more that are getting rotated."
pkmntcg,3cr0r0,supermariokoopa,1 point,Fri Jul 10 02:08:01 2015 UTC,"Not 100% sure, but I know some of the most serious collectors (if having some of the rarest and most expensive cards makes you a serious collector) do not use gloves.  PSA will generally increase the value of your cards by a lot more than Beckett."
pkmntcg,3cr0r0,OzEnigma2,1 point,Fri Jul 10 03:12:16 2015 UTC,Thanks for the reply! I am not sure if I am misunderstanding your reply (and I probably am) by handling the cards I meant the BGS or PSA while they inspect it not the collector themselves. Again I am probably misunderstanding what you wrote but just thought I'd point it out.
pkmntcg,3cr0r0,OzEnigma2,1 point,Fri Jul 10 03:53:47 2015 UTC,Yep you've read right. Why does it matter if they are wearing gloves when people who originally sent cards for submission of cards worth thousands don't use gloves?  Not sure I understand why you want your graders to wear gloves? You understand PSA is pretty much the authority when it comes to third party grading and that they know what they are doing yeah?
pkmntcg,3cr0r0,OzEnigma2,1 point,Fri Jul 10 04:30:02 2015 UTC,Actually as stupid as this sounds I never even thought of that XD I guess it was just of fear of some other oil or dirt getting on the card possibly hindering the cards grade but the more I think about it the more I realize that's not really I thing I should really worry about. Thank you very much for replying again!
pkmntcg,3cr0r0,boredguy8,1 point,Fri Jul 10 04:41:27 2015 UTC,No worries mate. I wish you the very best with your returns and hope to see you post them =)
pkmntcg,3cr0r0,robzirra,1 point,Fri Jul 10 04:53:05 2015 UTC,I will be sure to :)
pkmntcg,3cr0r0,Patriots_Fan,-1,Fri Jul 10 04:54:49 2015 UTC,"A lot of people handling rare and valuable goods don't use gloves because it decreases tactile feedback and is more prone to causing problems. It basically gives you a -2 on your dexterity rolls, in other words ;)   Edit: Just saw this was downvoted but it's 100% true, idk what ppl are smoking. ""Awkward mobility. Loss of feeling. Impaired sensations. These are not descriptions of a trip to the dentist, but rather a visit to the reading rooms of many special collections where the experience of handling valuable rare books and documents is synonymous with donning white cotton gloves. This paper examines the effect of this well-meaning effort to protect our irreplaceable holdings from soiling in light of the potential for damage introduced by handicapping the handler. Routine hand washing is recommended as a more effective means of preventing the spread of dirt while improving the user's haptic response to and tactile appreciation of the collections."" http://content.lib.utah.edu/utils/getfile/collection/uspace/id/1441/filename/image"
