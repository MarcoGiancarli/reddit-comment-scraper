For example, the other day I was working, and looked outside after a gay pride parade, and asked my boss why there was so many black people outside. She proceeded to tell me she didn't know, but that it was kind of a racist thing to say.   I don't believe I'm better than black people. I don't think the white race is superior in any way. I don't give a shit what kind of skin color you are, it's the kind of person that you are that I look at. There was just a lot of black people out, and I was simply being observant.  And yet it was referred to as racist.   The hell, man."

Other cop came they put her on the ground and cuffed her. Now u say ud put her on her stomach. She's pregnant y are you trying 2 kill her baby u peice of shit? U guys see this right?

BestOfLiveleak,3akz97,Hello-Universe,5,Mon Jun 22 05:13:40 2015 UTC,"That's poaching....I consider hunting a necessity. You're either killing off over-populated animals to help balance a very delicate ecosystem, or you're hunting to eat food. Both are very beneficial practices when trained properly and respect for the animals and environment are considered. Animal tags are enforced strictly and only a very specific amount can be given out each year. These numbers are based on population numbers and protecting the ecosystem. Conservation and hunting play a vital role in the balance of nature. Did you know a male rhino can kill off hundreds of other male rhinos in an area, pushing the endangered limit? One dead rhino that feeds an entire village and saves 100 other rhinos from dying is not a bad thing. Most hunters follow this route....don't let one bad apple ruin the bunch for you."
BestOfLiveleak,3akz97,howto69,2,Tue Jun 23 01:42:39 2015 UTC,"Traditional hunting is fine in my book and by the looks of your statement you can agree as well. I do have a problem with endangering the species or killing a animal only because ""it looked fun or cool""."

I'm reminded of dolphins drowning and raping other animals for fun.  There was a group of monkeys that would masturbate using a toad/frog, killing it in the process.

We all were pretty much best friends regardless of belief. You generalize something which can't be generalized. There may be areas that can be unsafe but overall the muslim community is very welcoming if you just show a little interest in them.

Is it a pool that requires payment to enter? Just because it says ""public"" pool does not mean its public property. People forget that when the term public is used with public pool, it really just means communal, where everyone and anyone can use it and its not gated by a membership. Door fees have been a common thing at a lot of public pools when I grew up and you are right, if property has a fee to use it, you must pay the fee."

It's dumb as hell how they all feel they're entitled to everything for free. I don't have that mindset. I respect police and understand they're doing their job (a tough one at that). All they ever want most of the time is to get people calm so they can figure out what's going on. For some reason that's too hard for them to do. Shit, sometimes the officer is wrong but he/she can't figure that out if you're yelling, running, and becoming aggressive. The shit saddens me. We should be better than this but we aren't. They make it tough for people like me, because, when it comes down to me interacting with an officer they're already going to have that stigma in mind since most other Black Americans respond in that way."

One of the kids had on jeans shorts and not an actual swim suit so they said that he was not allowed in the pool. She asked if she could run back home and get him a swim suit. They employees said no because the other kids wouldn't be supervised. That's when all the arguing started and someone called the cops on them. With that being said they should not have resisted the way they did with the cops. Another side note to the story, one of the girls who is 13 or 14 suffered a broken jaw and a fractured ankle from being thrown against a police cruiser by one of the cops. This is one of those stories where each party over reacted each step of the way. Like I said though, they were obviously resisting the police and escalated the situation, despite whether or not they felt justified in their argument."

BestOfLiveleak,37nlfx,Aferral,10,Fri May 29 14:13:09 2015 UTC,"Thanks for that -- here's the explanation:  A local college student was captured on camera as she made a loud outburst in class, then attacked students and staff.  A Florida Atlantic University professor was holding a study session before a midterm on evolution, when the female student asked the professor a racially-charged question.  According to the student's classmates, she was not happy with the teacher's answer and began to yell and threatened to kill the professor and fellow students.  A few minutes into the outburst, the cell phone video showed the belligerent college student as she became violent toward a technician who walked into the classroom and tried to get the student to leave the classroom. The technician had to defend himself against the student and physically removed her from the class.  Another video showed campus police as they tried to calm the enraged student. Officers carried the student into the back of a squad car, then used a Taser to subdue her.  Tuesday night, FAU released the following statement: ""In light of today's information, the Dean of Students is taking immediate action regarding this student.""  According to FAU, after the student was arrested, she was taken to the hospital for a mental evaluation."

Make sure you keep your guns locked up if you have children too.   ""Of the homes with children and firearms, 55% were reported to have one or more firearms in an unlocked place,”   ""43% reported keeping guns without a trigger lock in an unlocked place 73% of children aged nine and under reported knowing the location of their parents’ firearms and 36% admitted that they had handled the weapons, including many whose parents had reported their children did not know the location of their firearm.

They went on to say that it would be impracticable for the officers to seek warrants for every vehicle searched and that to do so would eliminate any deterrent towards smuggling and illegal immigration. The court felt that any intrusion to motorists was a minimal one and that the government and public interest outweighed the constitutional rights of the individual.  The court also ruled that the stops were Constitutional even if largely based on apparent Mexican ancestry.  However the court added that restrictions still exist: ""We have held that checkpoint searches are constitutional only if justified by consent or probable cause to search"" (though the court did hold that the probable cause bar was low for permanent checkpoints with limited impact on motorists). The Court also held, ""our holding today is limited to the type of stops described in this opinion. -Any further detention...must be based on consent or probable cause. Our prior cases have limited significantly the reach of this congressional authorization, requiring probable cause for any vehicle search in the interior and reasonable suspicion for inquiry stops by roving patrols (as opposed to permanent checkpoints)."" 428 U.S. 543, 567 (1976).  The recent SCOTUS ruling on having to wait at a checkpoint while being detained does limit them further still though.

BestOfLiveleak,35cmjq,chuxsux,2,Sat May 9 02:30:37 2015 UTC,"It was originally created to try and stop those smuggling illegal immigrants into the country. So according to the case which you cite, the border guards must prove that they had reasonable suspision that the woman was an illegal immigrant ( even though it's clear in the video that she gave ID, which had her address on it). At this point it could become illegal for border guards to begin searching a car for drugs, or any other contraband.  ""Martinez-Fuerte held that internal checkpoints were considered to be a functional equivalent of a border crossing only if the government could prove with reasonable certainty that traffic passing through was international in character and would be comprised of only a ""negligible number of domestic travelers.""  The Border Patrol's Inspector's Field Manual governing internal checkpoints has been public information since 2008, thanks to a successful FOIA request from immigration attorney Charles M. Miller. According to Section 18.7 of the manual, before an inspector may constitutionally detain a traveler at a non-entry checkpoint, the inspector ""must have reasonable suspicion that the person is an alien and is illegally in the United States."""""

BestOfLiveleak,35cmjq,A84SheepDog,0,Sat May 9 17:35:23 2015 UTC,There's a huge difference between local police and border agents. Any agents who work along borders have more authority to detain or take things they want if they can deem it a national security threat. This guy seemed to be somewhat decent in the build up. I fault her for trying to get snazzy with the officer and instigating the scenario.
BestOfLiveleak,35cmjq,mdisil427,1 point,Sat May 9 06:13:45 2015 UTC,"She wasn't at a border, that's the issue, it's an internal checkpoint within the states, usually about 100 miles from an international border. Had it been at the actual border, all power to the CBP."
BestOfLiveleak,35cmjq,A84SheepDog,0,Sat May 9 13:42:47 2015 UTC,No.  she was being a fricking twat.  THAT is the issue.
BestOfLiveleak,35cmjq,A84SheepDog,2,Thu May 14 20:42:35 2015 UTC,I'm not discounting the fact she was looking for a conflict. I just don't agree with borders inside your own country...
BestOfLiveleak,35cmjq,A84SheepDog,2,Thu May 14 23:45:58 2015 UTC,"It was an internal checkpoint. The implementation of these is fairly new and still controversial. There's also hundreds of lawsuits currently pending throughout the country regarding the matter. Costing hundreds of millions of dollars of tax payer dollars. Basically any place which is within 100 miles of any border in the US is considered a ""constitutional free"" zone, which means you lose a lot of your constitutional rights if you are in any of these. The concept is quite old actually, but they started enforcing them again after September 11th and the Patriot Act gave DHS and Border Patrols more leeway in their usage.  So no, the game isn't over at being detained, cases like these have routinely gone all the way up to the state supreme courts.  It's easy to argue that randomly pulling people off the street and searching their vehicle without a warrant or due process is in violation of the 4th amendment."
BestOfLiveleak,35cmjq,CongoAndTheNuggets,-6,Sat May 9 13:15:29 2015 UTC,"Well they said she was acting nervous, so they thought she might be holding. If you have nothing to hide and you really wish to leave then show them. If you choose not to show them, then it only looks more suspicious. The border patrol did seem a bit excessive with the taser, but you couldn't see if she tried to hit them or not after the guy began pushing her back towards her vehicle."
BestOfLiveleak,35cmjq,mettlemetal,1 point,Sat May 9 01:28:16 2015 UTC,Yeah i agree with the whole show them thing.  I personally would show them because I have nothing to hide. But i guess it's the principle. I also don't know the law but I still feel like they should have let her go.

BestOfLiveleak,35cmjq,the_yeasty_cunt,0,Sat May 9 01:44:33 2015 UTC,Actually the law DOES give you the right to be a cunt. It's call the First Amendment.
BestOfLiveleak,35cmjq,gngrbrdmn,1 point,Sat May 9 02:26:02 2015 UTC,"Im assuming your pulling the free speech portion out of the First Amendment. There are many different types of speech that are not covered by the First Amendment.

Fighting words are a category of speech that is unprotected by the First Amendment. Chaplinsky v New Hampshire, 315 U.S. 568 (1942)."" Www.law.cornell.edu/wex/fighting_words  So in my defense, if someone is acting like an uppity cunt with their words and getting in my grill about why i pulled them over, this might make me want to commit an act of violence towards them.

She used to tell them horrible things when they didn't act the way she wanted them to.

In that struggle, the gun went off and wounded Daniels. At that point, the two were attempting to use lethal force on him. The fact that the standing officer only fired one shot at the leftmost person on top of the officer is HUGE restraint. Even in the heat of the moment, he only fired after attempting to hit the man with a baton, and noticing that it did nothing to slow his fight to get the gun away from Daniels.  Additionally, if you follow the other assailant who was on top of Daniels, after the leftmost one is shot the other continues to fight and eventually makes his way back to where Daniels is laying wounded, and the officer tending to Daniels has to draw his weapon and threaten the man away.  This was totally justified and I am surprised by how well the officers handled it. I would say the least amount of necessary lethal force was used."

You see two guys on the officer who I believe shoots, for quite a while. No telling what was going on in that pile, if he was getting stabbed, or the threat of it, let alone trying to end a situation and 4 minutes in, you're on your back with two dudes on you, so he pulls his gun then to save himself.

But no, instead, we're discussing a brutal gang of cops that beat the living shit out of a guy who had clearly surrendered.  That has become the story, and it really is a shame."

I can kind of see his right hand go to his back but can't make out the left hand.  Most of the beating seemed to focus on the left too.  Either way all it proves is we need body cameras with audio on every cop, it just doesn't protect us but them also if they did no wrong.  A one minute beating is disturbing, only if the guy reached under him and wouldn't take his hand out and they thought he had a gun could I say OK, its better than killing him... but that was a long beating."

To me, its the only reason for a cop to beat someone that is down; getting a weapon from them... anything else is just an abuse of authority and once the weapon is away the beating should stop that instant.  After watching it a few more times, his hand was down there to shortly to be doing anything but possibly moving something that was poking him.  But hey, go ahead and read more in to a statement than is actually there."

BestOfLiveleak,2zko0t,IvyGold,15,Thu Mar 19 11:11:42 2015 UTC,Grenade training in the U.S. military works the same way.  The first time you throw one there is a burly dude next to you waiting to tackle you into a concrete hole if you drop it.  Those guys get hazardous duty pay too.
BestOfLiveleak,2zko0t,mandatoryseaworld,7,Thu Mar 19 13:25:33 2015 UTC,"Huh, TIL. I love little fun facts about the military. Thanks!"
BestOfLiveleak,2zko0t,HereToHumilateAFrand,8,Thu Mar 19 16:08:40 2015 UTC,We had a dillweed forget to pull the pin but still threw it over the berm. They couldn't leave a live grenade out there so EOD had to come out. It was a long day.
BestOfLiveleak,2zko0t,THESALTEDPEANUT,6,Fri Mar 20 02:30:59 2015 UTC,"Its also a very odd throw. You stiff arm-then-chuck. Instructors are taught to throw the Marine/soldier on the into the ""trench"" or foxhole and immediately dive on them to protect."
BestOfLiveleak,2zko0t,04AspenWhite,3,Thu Mar 19 16:50:22 2015 UTC,And the trench is a LOT closer.
BestOfLiveleak,2zko0t,droppedyourhat,13,Fri Mar 20 01:08:00 2015 UTC,Sure it's Korean? It's a Chinese news report and I'm pretty sure (though far from positive) the soldier was speaking Mandarin.

BestOfLiveleak,2zko0t,Paiste402,5,Thu Mar 19 22:32:38 2015 UTC,"Grenades are actually designed to make a shock wave full of shrapnel.

BestOfLiveleak,2zko0t,ostrichwrangler,4,Fri Mar 20 02:29:47 2015 UTC,Grenades have very little fire. Mostly just a hard shockwave designed to disperse shrapnel.
BestOfLiveleak,2zko0t,amichaux,-2,Thu Mar 19 22:29:14 2015 UTC,Looked like a smoke to my counter strike eyes
BestOfLiveleak,2zko0t,i_em_a_humon,8,Thu Mar 19 15:35:02 2015 UTC,Because they would obviously dive into a trench to save themselves from smoke

BestOfLiveleak,2z7rjo,IvyGold,18,Mon Mar 16 09:04:02 2015 UTC,"I am not taking either side on this, but here is a novel idea.  Instead of the cop taking the time to pull out his pad to get the persons name, he instead takes the time to explain why it is not a handicapped spot."
BestOfLiveleak,2z7rjo,Nailbiter54,3,Mon Mar 16 21:00:37 2015 UTC,Good point. People on both sides of the camera are being a little dickish in this situation.
BestOfLiveleak,2z7rjo,benmarvin,38,Mon Mar 16 23:58:47 2015 UTC,"I am not defending this man.   This is a quote from the Webster, MA PD's Facebook:   "". In Massachusetts a handicapped parking spot needs to be posted with signage that designated that parking spot a designated handicapped parking spot. McDonald’s had recently expanded their handicapped parking and the sign for this spot was removed and the symbol was painted over. However, through the wear and tear of winters and traffic in New England, the black paint wore off and the symbol is somewhat visible, which thus makes it appear to be a handicapped parking spot which it is not."""
BestOfLiveleak,2z7rjo,CSHufflepuff,12,Mon Mar 16 18:25:57 2015 UTC,Came here to say this.  If there is no sign it's no longer a handicap spot or does not qualify as a legal handicap spot.  The painting does not qualify.
BestOfLiveleak,2z7rjo,drteq,2,Mon Mar 16 19:30:55 2015 UTC,I wonder how the Diff'rent Strokes PD would have handled it.
BestOfLiveleak,2z7rjo,mikenice1,4,Tue Mar 17 02:11:22 2015 UTC,They probably wouldn't know what we were talking about.
BestOfLiveleak,2z7rjo,CSHufflepuff,2,Tue Mar 17 02:15:26 2015 UTC,"Well, parking in a handicapped spot might be right for you, but may not be right for some."
BestOfLiveleak,2z7rjo,mikenice1,2,Tue Mar 17 03:34:28 2015 UTC,I don't have true clarity on the what happened so I will not defend or condemn.
BestOfLiveleak,2z7rjo,CSHufflepuff,16,Mon Mar 16 19:09:51 2015 UTC,"actually the handicap spot needs to he clearly marked, which this one is not. leading me to believe the cop may be in the clear, most likely a decommissioned handicapped spot"

BestOfLiveleak,2z7rjo,Aboxingspacecraft,5,Mon Mar 16 20:57:09 2015 UTC,That's actually very well stated.
BestOfLiveleak,2z7rjo,DeadSeaGulls,-25,Mon Mar 16 22:04:36 2015 UTC,"So police officers do, and should, park closest to the entrance. If he's inside grabbing lunch and a armed break in situation came over the radio, and your daughters is the victim in the house, I hope to god he isn't running through lines of parked cars trying to remember where he parked and gets to the scene a few seconds too late to save your daughter. edit: he also has a shotgun and an AR15 in the back of that cruiser... so he should probably park where he can keep eyes on it."
BestOfLiveleak,2z7rjo,Bear_Hopkins,2,Mon Mar 16 14:48:12 2015 UTC,If he was worried about responding to an emergency he would have backed the cruiser into a parking spot. Not parked half-assed with half the car not even in the lines.   This fat-ass was getting burgers for his other fat-ass friends so they can go back to writing parking tickets and harassing people with real jobs.
BestOfLiveleak,2z7rjo,DeadSeaGulls,-3,Mon Mar 16 15:22:14 2015 UTC,"fair enough, but response time or not, he still has firearms in that car.  Dude is probably an ass (most cops I've met are), but I'm just trying to look at the motivations an ass would have."
BestOfLiveleak,2z7rjo,in_da_tr33z,10,Mon Mar 16 15:37:32 2015 UTC,So why not say that instead of denying that the spot was handicapped designated then trying to intimidate the guy who called him out? That scenario is unlikely at best and clearly wasn't the reason that the cop parked where he did.
BestOfLiveleak,2z7rjo,DeadSeaGulls,-6,Mon Mar 16 15:56:50 2015 UTC,"because he's a dude, at work, which already sucks, and everywhere he goes people give him shit for his chosen occupation. I'm not saying the cop is right for how he handled this at all.  I'm just saying he's a human and I bet he's been being harassed for his job for a long fucking time.      the scenario is unlikely at best. I agree.  but remember that he has a shotgun and an AR15 in the trunk of that car as well.  He really can't afford to park it out of sight.  Motorbike cops do this all the time. they park on the sidewalk right next to a window where they can see their bike from inside. they have a shotgun strapped to the motorcycle.   So that coupled with decreasing response time and yeah, cops tend to park like dicks.        Matter of fact I dislike just about every cop I've ever met... but if my job was dealing out fines and tickets and everyone hated me for doing my job, I'd probably transform into a cunt over a few years as well.     Course, I chose not to be a cop, so at least I got that going for me."
BestOfLiveleak,2z7rjo,ne99ne,2,Mon Mar 16 15:30:35 2015 UTC,everywhere he goes people give him shit for his chosen occupation.   Nah. They give him shit for parking in a handicapped parking space. Didn't you watch the vid?
BestOfLiveleak,2z7rjo,AR_Ent_CP,1 point,Mon Mar 16 15:38:01 2015 UTC,"They give him shit for being a piece of shit. You justified his parking arrangements but not his shitty attitude.

In most states unless signage is posted vertically and shows information that it is handicapped parking, and a affixed sign also shows the fine amount, it is not enforceable.

BestOfLiveleak,2yblzi,callmegecko,-7,Sun Mar 8 21:09:17 2015 UTC,"It seems like that may not be the case. The boar didn't start squirming until the hunter came into the boar's field of vision at t=0:58. It was only then then that it began ""running,"" meaning that the sight of the hunter induced the boar to try to escape. Obviously, it wasn't upright, so it wasn't successful.  Then look at where the hunter pierced the skull. He seems to have shot the boar above the left eye, near the ear (image 1, image 2, image 3).  Now, I don't know much about boar anatomy, but I do know a great deal about human head and neck anatomy. Extrapolating my medical knowledge, it would make sense that the board had its CN VIII (vestibulocochlear) damaged by the shot. This nerve runs from the two organs of the inner ear and to your brain. It provides knowledge of body orientation (vestibular canals) and hearing (cochlea). So, I'd guess that the boar was able to see the hunter and decided to high tail it out of there. The only thing was that the severed nerve wasn't able to direct the boar into the upright position.  edit: Haters gonna hate. I'm pretty sure I'm right, so downvoting me doesn't make it less true."

BestOfLiveleak,2yblzi,plurality,-18,Sun Apr 19 19:46:59 2015 UTC,Yeah this video proves to me that those hunters who claim they have compassion are full of shit. What are bullets so expensive he couldn't have put that animal out of it's misery in a few seconds?
BestOfLiveleak,2yblzi,DidijustDidthat,17,Sun Mar 8 20:36:00 2015 UTC,Yeah because we can judge an entire subset of the population by one Liveleak video!
BestOfLiveleak,2yblzi,fronteir,-19,Sun Mar 8 20:48:40 2015 UTC,"Oh come on, you think this is the exception or the rule?"
BestOfLiveleak,2yblzi,DidijustDidthat,8,Sun Mar 8 21:28:40 2015 UTC,"The overwhelming rule with hunters is to practice and then do everything possible to make a quick and humane kill.   I don't think this guy is even an exception.  Probably first kill, he is shaking badly.  And wild boars are extremely mean and hard to kill."
BestOfLiveleak,2yblzi,tn_notahick,2,Sun Mar 8 23:50:10 2015 UTC,"Absolutely the exception. At least with the hunters I know. They truly respect nature, want no suffering and appreciate what they take."
BestOfLiveleak,2yblzi,Jowitness,3,Mon Mar 9 01:24:55 2015 UTC,"Boars, depending on where you live, are not native to the area and are doing a lot of harm to farmland and shit. Also very dangerous."

BestOfLiveleak,2yblzi,upinyabax,-1,Mon Mar 9 13:47:15 2015 UTC,"This is an insight into what hunting is. Obviously I am disgusted by the brutality of repeatedly shooting an animal to death. This death was very slow.   Now, Even if this is a very rare situation, how someone can do this and not be put off is what is shocking. Surely shooting any animal and witnessing this would be enough to put you off partaking in this as a hobby (I am fully supporting of people shooting pests if they need to).   As reddit has become more like ""let me think of a cleaver retort"" rather than understanding where I am coming from, I'm used to moronic comments, like yours, lacking any insight. :)."
BestOfLiveleak,2yblzi,DidijustDidthat,1 point,Mon Mar 9 13:54:27 2015 UTC,"This is an insight into what hunting is.   No, it's not. It is insight into what one idiot with a gun, that he can't use well, will do. Again, you are judging a multitude by the actions of one. If I put up a video of someone quickly, cleanly and efficiently dispatching an animal, would it then make you think that all hunters do it that way? I'm guessing no. I'm also guessing that the reason you find it so easy to judge all hunters by this video is because it's a better fit to your agenda.  You didn't decide that hunters were inhumane when you saw that video. You had your mind made up way before that.   I'm used to moronic comments lacking any insight   Yeah, me too.   Yeah this video proves to me that those hunters who claim they have compassion are full of shit   Kinda like that."
BestOfLiveleak,2yblzi,upinyabax,0,Mon Mar 9 14:05:34 2015 UTC,"To be fair I recognise my comment is a bit stupid. I didn't re write it to clarify my position because people were already responding.  But this is the reality of hunting is it not? Not hunting for survival, hunting for sport. This is sport. Even if this is a bad example it's essentially the same thing. Do I have problem with clean kills? No, just because hunting will never go away, Is there such a thing as a instant death with no suffering? um I'd put money on that being a no or at best a very rare  You can't just re write reality just because you enjoy the sport of hunting. Hunters turn a blind eye and I accept that the need is there to hunt, but if you're only doing it for your own pleasure and you choose to turn a blind eye to the suffering doesn't mean the rest of us have to turn a blind eye or deny that it's real."

BestOfLiveleak,2t2o04,TinMachine,-1,Wed Jan 21 16:31:12 2015 UTC,"yeah only that's literally the point she's making. she's asking why a painting of a vagina (by a man) is respectable, and appropriate for display but the real thing isn't.   It's not her asking people how dare they, but more a matter of asking why this action has a charge the other piece lacks (probably also worth noting that courbet's piece in itself took a long time to be accepted and was initially decried as obscene - the reaction De Robertis managed to get to her person is actually not a million miles from what Courbet faced - so it hangs together from an engagement pov)."

As the name suggests and as also mentioned by Wendell Levi in his book The Pigeon, this breed was developed in and around the City of Birmingham in England. The Birmingham Roller has a flying type and a show type. Show Rollers are larger than the flying variety, and are bred just for show. A similar breed called a Parlor Roller look much like Birmingham Rollers, but can't fly; rather, they spin backwards, somersaulting on the ground for many yards. Oriental Rollers are another aerial performer and come in many colour varieties. Some fanciers fly their rollers in competition, both locally and nationally. There is even a World Cup competition that includes several other countries. Kits (group of pigeons) are scored for quality and depth, as well as the number of birds that roll at the same time, referred to as a turn or break. The Birmingham Roller is a very popular breed of performing pigeon, with around 10,000 breeders worldwide.

BestOfLiveleak,2suggf,panch13,1 point,Sun Jan 18 20:16:47 2015 UTC,"Nematomorpha:       Nematomorpha (sometimes called Gordiacea, Nematomorpha commonly known as horsehair worms or Gordian worms) are a phylum of parasitoid animals superficially similar to nematode worms in morphology, hence the name. They range in size in most species from 50 to 100 centimetres (20 to 39 in) long and can reach in extreme cases up to 2 metres, and 1 to 3 millimetres (0.039 to 0.118 in) in diameter. Horsehair worms can be discovered in damp areas such as watering troughs, swimming pools, streams, puddles, and cisterns. The adult worms are free living, but the larvae are parasitic on arthropods, such as beetles, cockroaches, mantids, orthopterans, and crustaceans.  About 351 freshwater species are known  and a conservative estimate suggests that there may be about 2000 freshwater species worldwide.  The name ""Gordian"" stems from the legendary Gordian knot. This relates to the fact that nematomorpha often tie themselves in knots.

After being flown to Brackenridge hospital in Austin, doctors were forced to amputate the man's left hand, just above the wrist but were able to save his right arm despite severe compound fractures. Marc Wasson, a resident of Killeen, was driving his service truck east on Hwy. 71 when his vehicle came into contact with the guard rail at the bridge that crosses Lost Creek. The truck ran up onto the guardrail and almost went over the rail into the dry creek bed before it came back onto the roadway. The truck eventually came to rest on its side in the middle of the  highway with Wasson trapped inside. There was significant damage to the vehicle.  ""The cab of the truck actually came loose from the rest of the chassis, and he was trapped  inside with serious injuries to both arms and his head,"" said Brady Fire Chief Lyle Daniel.  The injuries nearly cost Wasson his life but Brady fire/EMS crews were able to extricate him and transport him to the Llano Hospital where they met Starflight Air Ambulance out of Austin which took him on to Brackenridge.  In a phone conversation Wednesday morning with Wasson's father, he stated that Marc had undergone emergency surgery Tuesday afternoon with five surgeons working to save his life and his limbs.  ""They had to amputate his left hand, but they were able to save his right arm and he is being moved out of ICU today,"" said Norm Wasson, Marc's father. ""He doesn't remember a thing about the accident.""  The accident shut down traffic on Hwy. 71 for approximately five hours. The size of the truck involved in the accident required a heavy-duty wrecker to remove it from the scene.  ""We actually had to enlist the use of a large front-end loader from one of the sand plants to right the truck so it could be moved from the highway,"" said Chief Daniel. According to DPS Trooper J.W. Weaver, the exact cause of the accident has yet to be determined, but it is still under investigation."

Not that it's horribly relevant, but I've seen these kinds of gathering and judging by the body language, and with quite a bit of speculation to fill in the gaps, here is what happened:  Girl in lime green top is trying to have a good time. She seems to be walking around, dancing with every guy she sees. Pretty standard fare in Salsa or Merengue clubs.  Now baseball hat dude seems to be tailing her, wanting to dance. He doesn't seem like her bf her husband to me, just a guy really interested in getting her attention. Perhaps he feels entitled cause he bought her a drink off camera.   Now older, red shirt guy was hanging around and lime green top girl takes his hand to dance with her. Baseball cap guy seems upset about this and insists she dance with him, slapping away red shirt's hand. Red shirt dude feels disrespected by this and has some strong words with baseball cap man. Red Shirt then goes back to his group and complains that baseball cap guy was cockblocking him (all the guys here seem to be under the impression that the girl is into them, but she just seems to want to dance). Baseball cap dude whips out some absolutely horrible dancing skills (lime green top girl even sort of laughs at him) and eventually, red shirt older guy has seen enough and wants to show him how its done, so he takes her hand in an attempt to dance with her. Baseball cap dude sort of roughly rebukes him, so trilby guy (who seems to be a friend of the red shirt older man) sucker punches him baseball cap guy. Lime green top girl realizes what just went down and laughs at these old dudes literally throwing punches over her. She runs away laughing.  Gringo guy and his Latina gf in a striped dress help the baseball guy up, who is dazed."

It comprises 65 student clubs and societies from over 40 Turkish universities.  The TGB is an anarcho-communist organization that has strong beliefs in conspiracy theories about the West controlling the AK Party despite the AKP opposing many Western principles and initiatives as well as the continuously deteriorating relations with Western governments at the helm of the AKP leader, Recep Tayyip Erdogan. The TGB has strong xenophobic beliefs such as removal of English classes from schools in Turkey.  The TGB alleges it advocates the principles of Mustafa Kemal Atatürk but contrary to pro-Western beliefs of Atatürk, the TGB completely opposes the West. It opposes any future Turkish membership in the European Union and any cooperation with what it calls ""American imperialism"".   It has organized mass protests against the AKP.

Difficulties faced by Greece after the war in quelling a communist rebellion, along with demands by the Soviet Union for military bases in the Turkish Straits, prompted the United States to declare the Truman Doctrine in 1947. The doctrine enunciated American intentions to guarantee the security of Turkey and Greece, and resulted in large scale U.S. military and economic support.  This support manifested in the establishment of a clandestine stay behind army, denoted the ""Counter-Guerrilla"", under Operation Gladio. After participating with United Nations forces in the Korean War, Turkey joined the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) in 1952.

The soldiers were released after sixty hours, after Turkey protested to the United States.  Though neither side ever apologized, a US-Turkish commission set up to investigate the incident later issued a joint statement of regret.  In addition, US Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld wrote a letter to the Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan expressing sorrow over the incident.  The Hood event damaged diplomatic relations between Turkey and the United States and marked a low point in US-Turkish relations. While the incident received comparatively little coverage in the United States, it was a major event in Turkey, many of whose citizens saw it as a deliberate insult and nicknamed it ""The Hood event"".

BestOfLiveleak,2m06cw,HoverhandsMcgee,20,Wed Nov 12 00:41:03 2014 UTC,My muslim friends are sharing this video as evidence that women should wear Hijabs. Interesting.
BestOfLiveleak,2m06cw,oahmed64,3,Tue Nov 11 21:39:01 2014 UTC,So when will you wear it?
BestOfLiveleak,2m06cw,Creature_73L,6,Tue Nov 11 22:26:37 2014 UTC,"Should? no. Have the freedom to wear it or not, yes."
BestOfLiveleak,2m06cw,ArabRedditor,7,Wed Nov 12 05:47:55 2014 UTC,"As a muslim i believe women should see the beauty in non revealing clothes(not necessarily and niqab or bruka, since very few muslim women i know wear them) and should make THEIR OWN CHOICE if they want or dont want to dress up in whatever clothes they want  i also believe this video is terrible evidence for such a message."
BestOfLiveleak,2m06cw,Hrodrik,-3,Wed Nov 12 05:33:18 2014 UTC,"That's because muslims, just like trash from the hood (be it black, white or latino), need to be repressed somehow. Animals gonna animal."

BestOfLiveleak,2m06cw,user188,9,Wed Nov 12 05:33:18 2014 UTC,"Well I don't really want to add more racism to this comment section, so I'll bring up something different.   What was this video trying to say? That people have more respect for women in hijabs, or that people don't like Muslims, so they don't even pay attention to the Muslim woman? It seems to me that walking in the hijab is a much more pleasant experience.  Also, of course people are going to react differently to a person walking around in tight clothes compared to baggy clothes."
BestOfLiveleak,2m06cw,Toffington,5,Wed Nov 12 00:44:14 2014 UTC,What racism?
BestOfLiveleak,2m06cw,Creature_73L,3,Wed Nov 12 05:03:04 2014 UTC,"Only 1 comment I've seen could be deemed racist, but it's so horribly worded and structured that I'm not even entirely sure what they're trying to say."
BestOfLiveleak,2m06cw,msixtwofive,3,Wed Nov 12 05:51:41 2014 UTC,All it says is that hijabs don't make women attractive enough to try to flirt with.
BestOfLiveleak,2m06cw,MrSlyMe,2,Sat Nov 15 21:48:55 2014 UTC,It actually implies that wearing different clothing (even less revealing clothing) will prevent you from being harassed.  Which seems like a horrible message.
BestOfLiveleak,2m06cw,lukeptba,2,Mon Jan 5 17:28:36 2015 UTC,"I don't think you know what constitutes a race to begin with.  Either that, or you just completely deny the definition just so you can use the word 'racist' in all of your nobility."
BestOfLiveleak,2m06cw,Hexratexra,3,Sun Nov 16 08:54:55 2014 UTC,So black guys aren't attracted to women in hijabs? No shit
BestOfLiveleak,2m06cw,Shepherd77,7,Wed Nov 12 14:42:36 2014 UTC,"I dont understand his point, is he saying Sharia law is good or something?"
BestOfLiveleak,2m06cw,Jabrono,2,Wed Nov 12 03:26:39 2014 UTC,I agree. Is the only point just that you won't get any cat-calls while wearing a hijab? Anyone less than half retarded could've told you that. The outcome of the video seems extremely overly obvious.
BestOfLiveleak,2m06cw,bryanrobh,2,Wed Nov 12 07:56:40 2014 UTC,I hate these dumb videos.  What does this prove?  That guys like tits and ass oh no got us.

BestOfLiveleak,2l937w,pat_15jordan,17,Tue Nov 4 21:59:41 2014 UTC,"Of course. Always someone who WOULD have done something if they HAD been there. That shit is so easy to say. Why would you bother? Yes, that kid is an asshole. He's one of thousands just like him. You'd just end up in trouble for putting your hands on him. Even if he's a legal adult. You can't just fuck him up because he's a dick. Him being an asshole is not a threat to you....maybe to your sensibilities, as it should be.  The major part of me wishes someone would kick his ass. Should have been done a few years ago when it would have had more bearing on how big of an asshole he would have ended up being. See, that's the thing about getting your ass handed to you. You learn from that shit. As in most things, you learn better if you learn younger. 15-18 yrs. old is a prime period to get the most 'lesson-learned' from the least amount of ass kicking. 1 or 2 times usually does it.   That's not to imply that everyone should get their ass kicked. It's not a 'par for the course' type thing. Most people grow up knowing how to act in the world. They appreciate that there are other people in the world besides them and they respect that. Then you have ones like this little jackass that has probably always gotten what he wanted when he was younger. If he got in trouble, mom and dad would get him out of it. So 'trouble is no big deal to him...there's no danger in it. Nothing to lose. If trouble meant going to jail or getting your ass stomped, he wouldn't act like this.  I see shit like this and it angers me. Doesn't make it my right to do anything about it....no matter how much I wish it was. I see this shit anymore, I just walk away. If he's in a Wal-Mart doing that shit, it's Wal-mart's problem. You're going to run into assholes. It's not your job or right to fix all of them.   I am not in any way defending this shitbag. However, they pay people to deal with assholes like this. Let them do it."

Lots of therapy, group therapy, humbling humiliation, and fucking hobbies (finding more than one hobby does wonders for the brain), helped me do a 180.. I'm just fortunate my friends didn't record the worst years of my life.   Funny side note: I took molly with some friends in the years I was trying to turn around, and it helped me admit my shitty behavior to myself and my friends.

I'm sure she pulled out her obama phone, called her grandma, who then told her to take an ambulance to the hospital. After waisting countless man hours a dr tells her she is will be fine and there is no need to come back for a reevaluation. She will ignore his advice and seek the advice of her granny. Her granny will tell her to go the chiropractor every other day until the inevitable court date. At court the honorary judge latisha Jackson will add up all the work Shes missed, add up all the chiropractor bills, multiply by 3 and award that to this women.
