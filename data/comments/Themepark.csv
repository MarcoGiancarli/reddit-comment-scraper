Themepark,3dv191,zepla,2,Sun Jul 19 19:16:59 2015 UTC,"I went back in 2006 and it was the first theme park I ever vitied. Disneyland Paris is about 30-45 minutes from the center of Paris. From what I remember the shows are all in French although I could be wrong. The park was dead when we went. It wasn't worth using fast passes. Space Mountain 2 (best ride there) was hop on. Big Thunder Mountain RR was my second favorite. The park food is pretty good, but man the ketchup is terrible. It's super super sweet. The park is close enough that you can continue to stay at your hotel in Paris unless you really want to stay on property. There are a bunch of hotels, although if you want to stay in one in Paris you can either rent a car (be sure one of y'all can drive manual) or you can ride the RER which is like commuter rail from Paris directly to Disneyland."
Themepark,3dv191,517634,1 point,Mon Jul 20 11:21:45 2015 UTC,Thank you so much for this reply! May I ask what time of year you visited the park?
Themepark,3dv191,517634,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:10:25 2015 UTC,"Sure I was there in the summer. It was sometime in July, I think our slow day was a fluke however due to tons of rain the night before. FYI The French generally have July and August off during the Summer as opposed to June and July (If you're American). One thing I remember for sure that was in French was Star Tours which I just looked up and is now only operating at Disneyland Paris!"
Themepark,3dv191,Baudim,2,Mon Jul 20 19:56:30 2015 UTC,"So let's start with the must see rides: In the main park for thrill rides you have Big Thunder Mountain, Space Mountain Mission 2 (which is closed these days for refurbishment), Indiana Jones rollercoaster and Pirates of the Carribean. In the Studios park you have the Rock'n rollercoaster, Crush's coaster (which has a huge waiting time), Tower of Terror and RC racer.  The slower and cooler ones are slow boat rides like It's a Small World or dark rides through the story of most famous Disney classics like Peter Pan (this one needs a fastpass because people love it). There's also a fun Buzz Lightyear shooting game in small ""spaceships"". In the Studios park you have many seated shows in French and English (gotta check the version before entering) related to cinema, my favourite is the Stitch Live one, in which you can meet and interact with Stitch.  I think 2 days are enough to see most of both parks, like said in another comment, spend a bit more time in the main park, but after all it depends on what kind of rides you prefer.  If you stay in Paris you can stay there and go to the park with the RER A, a commuter train. The train station is literally in front of the entrance of the park. I usually stay in one of Disneyland Paris hotels, which are quite expensive but are really close to the park and add a bit more magic to the experience.  About Disneyland Paris, the Disney Dreams show that happens right before the park closes is gorgeous and is a must-see! I tend to prefer eating in the main park because all restaurants are themed based on their location; restaurants in the Studios park, except the Ratatouille one, are pretty lame. Also I like to make most of my shopping in the shop World of Disney right outside the park. It doesn't have all the themed merchandise you can find in the park but it's great to have most types of merch in one place. Last thing that comes to my mind, the Pirates of the Carribean ride has a restaurant inside, Blue Lagoon. The food is really good and inspired by Carribean gastronomy but it is mandatory to book a table in advance.  Have fun !"

Themepark,3d53ko,huntergreenhoodie,2,Mon Jul 13 17:02:21 2015 UTC,"Typical a 4D ride means a 3D movie + seat movement.  Some even adds air jets (to simulate getting hit) and water sprays (to simulate wetness), but I don't recall CWL haven't those."
Themepark,3d53ko,number8888,3,Mon Jul 13 18:45:45 2015 UTC,"To me, a 4D ride means adding things in addition to the movement (bubbles, scents, water spray, etc) I always figured the simulator part of the name covered the movement of seats. Simulator ride = moving seats set to movie 3D simulator ride = said movie is in 3D 4D simulator ride = additional sensations added to movie"

Themepark,3cq1re,scottwalker88,3,Thu Jul 9 22:02:00 2015 UTC,LoL. Luckily that part of the facade will be blocked by the outdoor portion of the track and a fence so people won't be able to climb it... Or at least it should stop most people anyway.
Themepark,3cq1re,scottwalker88,3,Thu Jul 9 22:24:15 2015 UTC,I always assumed this would be part of the entrance to the ride.
Themepark,3cq1re,scottwalker88,3,Thu Jul 9 22:26:51 2015 UTC,"The giant temple gate is part of the ride. You enter the ride under an arch with Kong's head on it, located by the walkway path. Then after waiting in the queue, both outside and then inside, you board a ride vehicle shaped like a truck. The truck ventures outside for one scene before entering the giant gate back into the building for the main portion of the ride.  It should be impressive seeing the giant gate doors opening and closing every few minutes while walking by or waiting in line.  Edit: Here's some concept art depicting this."
Themepark,3cq1re,scottwalker88,4,Thu Jul 9 22:34:53 2015 UTC,"It makes perfect sense but the fact that it was so exposed made me think that it wouldn't be anything major to the ride itself to keep everything under wraps. I've read a few times that the queue will be an experience in itself.  The whole thing looks epic though, it looks like a good old fashioned attraction and hopefully there won't be any 3D screens in sight.  I'm curious to know if the ride will run in the rain as that rock work would look incredible with rain running down it."
Themepark,3cq1re,Unawa,3,Thu Jul 9 22:42:43 2015 UTC,"It will run in the rain, but it will have a track switch to bypass the outdoor section during the rain, unfortunately.

Themepark,3cojyj,Woirol,5,Sat Jul 11 17:50:06 2015 UTC,"I don't think people realise just how big the area between MiB and The Simpsons is. To do a comparison, the area is larger than the current space taken up by Dragon Challenge. Before MiB, the area was originally meant to be an Apollo 13 coaster with a recreation of the Vehicle Assembly Building from the Kennedy Space Center.  The rumours I've also seen about Fear Factor is that it will be transformed into a Harry Potter show as part of the 3rd HP area.  I think Beetlejuice is the only thing worth saving as it's always a great show. I think Disaster is near the end of it's life and has plenty of room to develop a great ride. They have room behind the attraction but I don't know how the Harry Potter train track will affect any expansion into the back of the park.  I find this weird: San Fransisco being “totally facelifted to Los Angeles.” As they already have a Beverly Hills area in the park where T2:3D is.  Either way, the future is looking bright for Universal and if Kong opens this year, Comcast are living up to their promise to deliver a new attraction every year up to 2018. At least they can do something right even if they are the most evil company in the world.  Edit: For anybody interested in the area between MiB and The Simpsons:  The area mentioned  Dragon Challenge  For another comparison if they were to build a coaster in there, the area is almost 200m wide and the lift hill on Kraken takes 120m from the bottom of the lift hill to the top.  It's a shame they never will build an out in the open coaster as it's far too close to the surrounding hotels."

The other goal is to create an international community and partnerships with other theme park blogs and sites, not ad revenue or competition.

The built a relatively new ride that's pretty great called Superman, I think.   Medusa is stellar, a classic really! Great floorless coaster!    Roar is a twisted wooden coaster with a lot of head choppers is my personal favorite there. As you might expect, it is pretty rough, but a blast!   Boomerang is a bit pedestrian, as it's the type that pulls ya back, go through the station, go through some inversions, then do it all again backwards. Eh.   Kong is a old rough inverted coaster. Pretty good, but not as smooth as Medusa.   V2 is great but short. Self explanatory when ya see it.   TL;DR- There are great rides and you will have fun! Not the best SixFlags, but a pretty nice one at that!   Oh, also let me know if I threw in any bizarre slang you didn't recognize.

If you do have time for both you can buy a season pass at one of them and use it at both parks. Vegas also had a few decent coasters. El Loco at Circus Circus is a cool little ride and Canyon Blaster is pretty fun. The New York New York coaster is the biggest coaster in Vegas. Desperado on the California/Nevada state line was the tallest coaster in the United States when it was built but it list that record a long time ago. It's still a pretty cool ride though.

Themepark,3ci8hl,provoaggie,2,Wed Jul 8 04:38:35 2015 UTC,"They're fun. There's a ride that swings you over the edge of the building, it's one of those spinny swings but it's cool. There's another that's like a seesaw and it also goes over the edge and you feel like the car's gonna roll off the end. Then there's the Big Shot at the very top which launches you up and you bounce around a bit. There's also the Sky Jump where you get in a harness and jump off the Stratosphere but you're on a vertical zipline so you don't really freefall. It's still good for adrenaline though!"
Themepark,3ci8hl,provoaggie,1 point,Thu Jul 9 04:58:56 2015 UTC,The only Stratosphere ride I ever rode was the roller coaster that is no longer there (it was a sorry excuse for a roller coaster). I love coasters but the idea of hanging off the side of a big building just isn't all that appealing so I skipped out on the other rides. The Big Shot looked cool but it was down for some reason the day we were there.

The park as a whole isn't very good but Cannibal looks incredible...I can't wait to check it out in a couple of weeks. It's probably a 6-7 hour drive north of Vegas though and I'm not sure if you want to go that far out of your way.

Making Hollywood studios into a circular type park would be nice since it's a pain to get from the tower of terror side to anything else without doubling back.   What Disney needs is innovation. That and to not take an eternity to update their parks. Look at Avatar land, construction started on January 10, 2014 and the area is set to be available in ""early 2017."" Three years to add a new area? If they started construction on Hollywood Studios and they weren't just revamping but actually building new areas it means it won't realistically be available anytime before July 2018.  I will say that the Star Wars weekends at Hollywood Studios are a lot of fun if you're a fan. Definitely worth the trip out there just to see the characters in full costumes and to check out the merch. If Disney embraced Star Wars even more they would continue to print money."

Themepark,3cbsuj,bruinsra1,1 point,Wed Jul 8 13:18:43 2015 UTC,"My hypothetical, unlimited budget solution, would be turn a park into a park about the history of film-making. The focus of the park would on the constant developments in filmmaking, celebrating both old milestones and new innovations.  One land would be back-and-white themed: A meet-and-greet area for Oswald, The Tower of Terror, opportunities for interestingly themed restaurants and gift shops.  One land would be themed 60s to 70s: RnR, The Magic of Disney Animation and The Great Movie Ride. This would be the area that speaks more to adults and would have sit-down restaurants and ift shops that sold more expensive merchadisid based around nostalgic movies.  The next area would be 80s to 2000s:  Indiana Jones, Beauty and The Beast, Star Tours. There could also be smaller attractions based on the old Star Wars movies placed close to Star Tours.  One area would be themed around CGI and contain all the Pixar stuff with new attractractions focused on new movies. There could be an attraction similar to ""The Magic of Disney animation"" that explains how computer animation works. Since this is the area that children would be most interestedin, there would be playgrounds, icecream stands and merchandising on contemporary films.  One building could be ""the future"" and focus on advertising upcoming movies, showing concept art, interviews with directors/writers/actors and trailers.   I know that this would probablynot be feasible and I'm not sure if the location of the attractions makes sense for this concept, but one can dream."

Basically what it comes down to (from what I've understood) is that something triggered a sensor and that in turn triggered the brakes for the first train. The second train was still going and then it reached the same brake run where it slowed down to a walking pace and bumped the train in front of it lightly.   I'm sort of believing that the bystander is just looking for a payday by saying they were going 'full pace'. I'm not really sure what to believe yet, but from the sounds of it, Alton Towers is telling the truth.  The four people taken to the hospital were taken as a precaution.

Themepark,3brwjm,scottwalker88,3,Wed Jul 1 20:41:56 2015 UTC,"Sure looks like him, and it would've been the time that they worked together on Thriller.  In fact, the Roaring Tiger coaster was briefly renamed the Michael Jackson Thrill Coaster.  I grew up 30 minutes away.  Went a couple of times when it was Circus World and several when it was Boardwalk and Baseball."
Themepark,3br3y1,scottwalker88,8,Wed Jul 1 13:54:25 2015 UTC,"I think Peter Jackson's involvement in this is particularly interesting. There was a rumour going about years ago that Universal were trying to lure Peter Jackson and more specifically, Lord of the Rings to Universal and to do so they were going to work on a smaller project first and see how the relationship turned out.  I'm not a huge Lord of the Rings or Hobbit fan but I've seen bits here and there and know that it would be a massive draw for the parks. If the rumours are true about Toon Lagoon being on the chopping block (which I think is a shame as both rides in the area are great) this scene could be a great concept to re-theme Popeyes."

You do this on King Kong 360 3D.  They then go to talk about how King Kong 360 3D is all about movie making.  That's not true at all.  The ride is as if we took the tram to Skull Island.

Make it the first joint venture with Nintendo and use their properties.  Unlike Disney, keep pace with technology after it's built.  Profit.  The first attraction to design: MarioKart VR with Oculus rift racing helmets, using motion base cockpits.  The second: live battle pokemon arenas with Microsoft hololens and pokeball-styled controller. Sell the pokeballs like potter wands.  Allow them to be used to capture and level pokemon in the arena and save them.  The third: 2-man team Starfox (pilot/gunner) using oculus helmets with seats/controls mounted to kuka arms."

Pick from two arenas: 10 vs. 10 PVP capture the flag or join other players co-op to battle metroids in survival mode.  As you collect power ups for your weapons by finding them in the arena, you can physically see your own arm transform into various types of cannons.  Fifth: Excitebike VR.  You are on a bike mockup racing an extreme jump course against the other players.  Oculus rift/kuka arm.  This would need a clever safety harness design and motion sensing controls in the bike base to allow you to lean the bike to control it.  If that hololens is as badass as it looks on youtube, the possibilities for that thing are just about endless.  You could carry a hilt that would sprout into link's sword to fight through the real-life world of hyrule.  Kids could just run around in an oversized-mushroom mario world set and interact with its virtual inhabitants.  I'm almost thinking they just hand everyone a hololens when they walk in the door."

Themepark,3bnah6,RealNotFake,6,Tue Jun 30 17:23:19 2015 UTC,"I think this sums up Disney's attitude recently with what is replacing it.  Disney seem to only be building something if it has an IP attached to it or some kind of sponsor. I don't think we'll see something like Expedition Everest (An original Disney idea, not attached to anything else) for example getting built for a long time.   For the foreseeable future, at WDW, it's going to be Frozen, Star Wars and Avatar."
Themepark,3bnah6,scottwalker88,3,Wed Jul 1 20:35:49 2015 UTC,"Which is kinda sad. Because honestly look at Disney's world famous attractions: Big Thunder Mountain, Space Mountain, Tower of Terror (Nobody really knows about the Twilight Zone so I don't count this one), Everest, Haunted Mansion, Phantom Manor, Soarin' Over California, California Screamin' Kali River Rapids etc. All unthemed rides. Not to say themed rides can't be great, Peter Pan for example or really most of the themed rides. But I just thought it was interesting that the unthemed ones are world famous."
Themepark,3bnah6,mrpiggywinkles52,3,Thu Jul 2 09:26:31 2015 UTC,yeah Twilight Zone is pretty well known but its not a crowd bringer.  No one is going on the ride because it's Twilight Zone they go because its a good ride.  But yeah Disney is screwing their parks by only using IPs.... espeicialy Avatar that's a huge mistake.
Themepark,3bnah6,VicariousFan,2,Sat Jul 4 11:51:04 2015 UTC,"I'm not so sure about the Twilight Zone, I think it's fairly well known amongst older visitors and is probably one of the most well done rides in WDW but that's neither here nor there.

It was my definition of paradise for me then, there were so many games and a lot of the interactive stuff like Astro Blasters (those bumper cars with the cannons) and CyberSpace Mountain being pretty awesome.

Themepark,3bnr0o,astilwell,2,Wed Jul 1 02:50:22 2015 UTC,"I went in October a few years back and found the crowd levels to be extremely manageable. The time to go to Disney World is when most kids are in school.   Plus, in October you have the Epcot Food and Wine Festival - a great opportunity to sample food and wine from all over the world, and see live cooking demonstrations & concerts.   Also, Mickey's Not So Scary Halloween Party, which as /u/assorted_donuts says is a separate ticketed event, but it's incredibly fun. Everyone in costumes, trick or treating, tons of great character meet and greets/photo ops.   For me, MNSSHP is worth it just for Haunted Mansion alone, because the Cast Members go all out during the event."

It's still something to be aware of, but it's not like something they hide and you'll be blindsided by. Those are actually good days to go to the MK because the crowds will be lower due to guests not wanting to ""waste"" a day where it closes early.

Themepark,3bjiaz,cheesethrower,21,Mon Jun 29 19:03:47 2015 UTC,"The complete lack of safety protocols annoyed me more than anything about this movie.  The original movie gives us a reason for shitty safety, Dennis Nedry. He feels slighted, so he fucks it all up. This movie gives us no reason except gross incompetence. I work at a theme park with a lot of animals, and if so much as a gazelle gets loose we'll have live ammo and tranqs trained on it in minutes. The directors of a park that just created a T. Rex/raptor hybrid are so concerned about an investment they would rather risk closing the park than just shooting the damn thing.  And then there's exactly what you mentioned with the gyrosphere ride. So you let guests loose in these machines and have absolutely no recall abilities? No track, no remote shut down, nothing? I call bullshit."
Themepark,3bjiaz,IspitonDumas,13,Mon Jun 29 19:53:11 2015 UTC,I thought the reason they could control the ride was because they had VIP access wristbands.

VIP is not ""all access"" except in dumb hollywood movies. I understand their wristband is the convenient reasoning for the dumb subplot of them going out of bounds, but that would never fly at a real amusement park, which is what this thread is about."
Themepark,3bjiaz,RealNotFake,7,Thu Jul 2 16:33:28 2015 UTC,I don't know which bothered me more; that scene or the scene where the kids managed to diagnose and repair the jeep in about ten minutes...because I'm sure that whatever parts needed to be replaced would be conveniently sitting right there along with all of the required tools plus gasoline and motor oil to fuel said car that's been abandoned for years on end.
Themepark,3bjiaz,Imaginos64,3,Mon Jun 29 20:56:20 2015 UTC,"All of that didn't bother me as much as the ridiculousness of Chris Pratt being able to suppress a raptor's natural instinct to kill by reaching out and saying ""easssssy"".

Themepark,3bjiaz,Imaginos64,2,Wed Jul 1 18:27:27 2015 UTC,"What I think happened was the writers of the movie didn't want it to use a bunch of cheesy hollywood tropes so they didn't initially write in the bogus love story stuff, but then their bosses told them ""Put it in anyway, people will want it"" and then they begrudgingly put it in - but at the same time they added the jokey bit with Jake Johnson's character playing a joke on the cliche.  It didn't work though, it felt so disjointed and abrupt. They wouldn't be having a dramatic love moment in the middle of all the action."

Themepark,3bjiaz,WHY-YOU-LITTLE,3,Mon Jun 29 20:06:37 2015 UTC,You mean the kind of ride op that wouldn't be a ride op for more then an hour? Not checking belts would get you immediately fired from almost any park in the world.
Themepark,3bjiaz,TheOnlyBoBo,2,Mon Jun 29 21:48:02 2015 UTC,Any park in the USA maybe.  I've been to parks overseas (the most notable of which was probably Europa Park) where my restraint wasn't checked on some coasters.
Themepark,3bjiaz,CurbYourNewUrbanism,2,Mon Jun 29 23:39:58 2015 UTC,Europa Park is different and so much more amazing for it. The family that owns that sell the rides you find in the park. The staff not checking the restraints is the complete faith they have in the ride systems (and also in the German public to not do something stupid).   I love Europa Park.

If you can visibly observe that the bar has been lowered (or not even that, you really only need the sensors to confirm that it has been lowered) then you're good to go.  They did check on the bigger coasters, though.  Amazing park."
Themepark,3bjiaz,CurbYourNewUrbanism,5,Tue Jun 30 01:44:02 2015 UTC,The park evacuation procedure was terrible as well. Have them all wait outside in the open ready to get picked off by loose Dino's? Probably not a good idea.

Themepark,3bky61,KaiserCoaster,3,Tue Jun 30 16:35:15 2015 UTC,"I've been to Great Adventure (home park), New England, and Discovery Kingdom. (Hopefully everyone starts off by saying where they've actually visited)  All great parks. Being in NJ, I'm also close to Six Flags America, and I've traveled past it several times, but never been there. Based on what I've heard about other parks, SFAmerica seems to be rather odd. I hear it's in a bad area, and they've definitely gotten the short end of the stick on new additions for as long as I can remember. However, a friend was there today so I watched his Snapchat story and heard a bit from him about his day. It does seem like a decent park.  If I really had to choose, I'd go with the Great Escape. I mean, when was the last time anyone even knew that existed? But in all seriousness, it seems like a nice relaxing park I'd like to visit. It's obviously not about insane thrills like most other SF parks."
Themepark,3bky61,Kmac09,1 point,Tue Jun 30 06:06:37 2015 UTC,No I'm sorry but Great Escape is easily one of the best Six Flags parks because it isn't Six Flagsy.  Also they have one incredible wooden coaster and a really fun Log Flume.  It is a unique feeling park in that it doesn't feel as loaded with the generic Six Flags trappings.
Themepark,3bky61,Bladeshadow,1 point,Tue Jun 30 16:26:19 2015 UTC,"Great Escape is my home park, and it really is a great family park. SFNE is close enough form it they don't need to compete in thrills, so all it really needs is an updated dark ride and to do something with the Nightmare/Steamin Demon area. I'd say remove SD and use the Nightmare building to build a ride similar to Verbolten from BGVA and they would be good to go."
Themepark,3bky61,Kmac09,1 point,Thu Jul 2 12:57:24 2015 UTC,I don't think you are likely to see Steamin Demon leave any time soon.  I think it would be nice if they were to put in a number of smaller rides.  It would be cool if they could build something into that existing building and use some of the area of the park that almost feels forgotten.

Themepark,3bky61,unionrodent,4,Wed Jul 1 19:29:45 2015 UTC,"Six Flags America in the DC area suffers from some pretty poor theming. Standout rides are the vekoma flying coaster and the superman (I beleive it's a carbon copy of Darian Lake's Ride of Steel) but the park has no soul and ride operation speed and maintenance is abysmal. Great Escape is smaller but at least charming, St. Louis isn't winning any prizes but edges out the DC park on operations. Havent been to Discovery Kingdom or La Ronde and the remaining parks are easily a tier above those I mentioned here."
Themepark,3bky61,RealNotFake,2,Tue Jun 30 05:59:20 2015 UTC,"St. Louis is a gorgeous park, one of the better locations in the chain despite the relative lack of thrills. I wouldn't even put it on the short list for worst SF park."
Themepark,3bky61,robkabob,1 point,Wed Jul 1 19:27:45 2015 UTC,"Been to Magic Mountain, Discovery Kingdom, Fiesta Texas, Great Adventure.   Magic Mountain has some of the worst ride operations of any park in the country. This summer they're running only 1 train on most of the coasters, leading to very long waits. In addition, while most of Six Flags has sub par maintenance as far as ride quality (for example, the ride quality between TTD and Kingda Ka), Magic Mountain is the worst of the chain IMO as well. Goliath runs horribly, Viper should be bulldozed, Scream's paint job was awful until this year, etc.   As good as some of their rides are, not a Magic Mountain fan."

I've been to Lake George twice in the last two years, and have never even considered visiting. It's priced like a Six Flags park ($57/day + $20 parking), and it's a park the size of Knoebels with worse rides. There's Comet, a boomerang, and an ancient Arrow corkscrew coaster, a dated collection of flat rides, and a token water park. In terms of least to offer... this is it. The saddest thing is that it's actually a really nice little place in a gorgeous setting. It would be a wonderfully charming little local park if it were priced like one, but it's priced like a full-sized Six Flags park, so the value proposition is straight up imaginary. I frankly have no idea how this wasn't included in the Elitch Gardens/Darien Lake/Enchanted Village sell-off back in 2007.  Runner Up:  Six Flags America  This is one of those parks that brags about having 9 coasters, despite most of them not really counting. I mean sure, they're rides, but they're some combination of small, old, rough, or just flat out crap. Of the good rides, Superman leads the charge, Wild One and Joker's Jinx tie for second, and maybe Apocalypse or Batwing if you're into bad-examples-of-coaster-styles-that-are-only-OK-to-begin-with. Everything else would fall firmly into the ""skippable"" category at any other park worth its admission fee. Couple it with crummy operation, shit maintenance ruining coasters (oh hi, Roar), and concrete-wasteland atmosphere, and it's right there at the bottom of the barrel, and it's definitely the worst ""full sized"" Six Flags park. All of this is made worse by the fact that it draws local crowds from DC and Baltimore... and from either of those places, an extra hour and change in the car could have you at the almost immeasurably superior Busch Gardens Williamsburg, Kings Dominion, or Six Flags Great Adventure."

Themepark,3bky61,b0yfr0mthedwarf,2,Tue Jun 30 20:45:32 2015 UTC,"I almost feel bad putting it first. For what it is (a small family park) and where it is (tiny vintage-twinged vacation town in upstate New York), it's actually a pretty acceptable place in terms of what it offers. But, because it's owned by Six Flags, it has become horrifically overpriced, and per your original question, it certainly offers the least great-rides-for-your-dollar from a value perspective. It's more of a ""if you're already in Lake George and you have an extra day, I guess you might as well"" rather than a destination worth driving to from, say... anywhere.  I'm also personally irritated by it because it's not run like, say, Knoebels or Waldameer or any of the other small parks that embrace their small park charm and quirk, and that maybe you should be able to pay as you ride if you want, rather than having to plunk down for 10 hours of admission when you'll be out of shit to do in 2.  I just want to ride the Comet one of these days without paying $80 for the privilege."

American Thunder is an amazing compact wooden coaster, the Mr Freeze in reverse is amazing, and the new Justice League ride is top notch.  While it was around I went to Six Flags Ohio a couple of times, and while it had the best Batman coaster ever, it was a pretty lackluster park. Small, dirty and kind of smelly as I recall."
Themepark,3bd8ru,BlankVerse,18,Sun Jun 28 03:03:41 2015 UTC,"Good. Too bad they had to, but they can't keep having rides shut down and reset because selfish and stupid people can't be responsible."

What pisses me off is that one person took out their selfie stick during a high speed roller coaster ride. I cannot believe that stupidity sometimes. Not only are you putting yourself in danger, you're putting everyone else in danger also. Sorry, I don't want to die because someone in front of me wanted to get a picture of themselves on a roller coaster.   Maybe I'm thinking too extreme? I don't know. What ever happened to people just taking pictures of their environment in front of them? I thought it was common sense not to take pictures (outside of gopro) on rides. There was a person who rode some roller coaster and they had the bright idea to take a selfie (cellphone only) at the top of a lift hill... The train went down and so did the phone.."

There are times when I can see them being practical but how stupid do you have to be to use one on a ride. Its dangerous and pointless. What's even stranger, is that it's encouraged people to take photos with a selfie stick in places they would never have attempted to before.  If you really want a picture with somebody that badly in Disney, there is always a cast member about who will gladly take a photo and probably a better one than you can take with a camera on a stick."

Themepark,3bd8ru,madagent,1 point,Sun Jun 28 20:47:58 2015 UTC,"Unpopular opinion but I think it's a shame because selfie sticks can be useful when you want a picture of the whole entire group, instead of having one person take the picture, and then switching out. It really should be common sense though, to not use them on rides and to mind the pathways you might block, etc. Now its just another privilege some people have ruined for everyone else..."

It's actually a super-impressive bit of technology, but I think time constraints limited its abilities early on. When it was running properly, it was literally impossible to see any of the wires.   The cow itself...meh. Worst part was that the VP who came to see the installation was a life-long cattle rancher and to say he was less than impressed with the sculpt on the cow would be a vast understatement.

However, Universal does a much better job of running its attractions at or near capacity, allowing for shorter average waits in that park than you'll find at Magic Mountain, which is notorious for running one train at a time on its coasters during the off-season, and two trains on most coasters even during busy times.  So if by ""crowded,"" you mean ""longer waits,"" that's Magic Mountain, even though there will be more people at Universal on any given day."

Once when I went, we rode Transformers over and over because there was absolutely no line. Same with mummy. The longest I've ever waited in line was 45 mins when transformers came out. Maybe we were just lucky, but it seems like this every time I went (it was always on weekends).  Every time I've been to Six Flags during peak season, I've always had to wait in really long lines for everything. 3 hours + for the X3.  I'm not sure the exact reason for this, though. Even though MM has way more rides, it seems like the turnover is very high on the universal rides. You just get in and go. I would definitely go to universal this year before Harry Potter shows up because the crowd attendance is going to go through the roof when they open.

Had a bit of a time fitting in Mystery Mine (never been on a Gerstlaurer before) and found it to a bit rough. I loved the view on Wild Eagle, and feel it was a very different coaster than Gatekeeper  (more traditional). Tennessee Tornado caught us by surprise at the brakes, and I loved Fire Chaser Express. Thought it was perfectly placed and paced. Thunderhead takes the cake for me though. We've been on a few GCI'S but nothing that crazy at all. Did front and back several times and found the back to be out of control. After the morning coasters, we relaxed the rest of the day for shows and the train. I loves the size of the locomotive (although I got some soot in my eyes).  Overall, the staff were incredibly friendly. People down south are quite nice so I've found out, and if I had a job opportunity down there I'd take it in a heartbeat. She's from Knoxville,  so I got a tour of around there as well. We finished it with Nashville, and called it a week.  So it went quite well I'd say. Heck of a first impression."

Themepark,3avzrd,juice13ox,2,Tue Jun 23 23:35:31 2015 UTC,Those are the three best there but I really like Medusa as well there. Worth the ride.  edit: a word
Themepark,3avzrd,alienware99,1 point,Wed Jun 24 02:37:16 2015 UTC,El toro is magnificent and is 10 times better then you'd think just by looking at it.  Nitro is so amazing!  I also have a soft spot for medusa/bizzaro which is kind of hidden in the back of the park. You get. A great view of the safari when your going up the lift hill.  Source: SFGA pass holder

Back when it was a Six Flags park, we did everything in a three hours, including sitting on Twisted Twins for a half hour while attendants cleaned up vomit. 4 hours is enough time to do the park (though, you might want multiple rides on Lightning Run)."

Themepark,3an69y,vinbel121,3,Sun Jun 21 21:49:50 2015 UTC,I hope the line never backs up to the queue house with all those lighting effects. That would be sensory overload. I think back to the never-ending queue effects and video for Flight of Fear in the US and it makes me feel a bit ill.

Themepark,3an69y,robotshoelaces,1 point,Mon Jun 22 04:58:14 2015 UTC,Did the PKD FoF have more effects than the PKI FoF had? All I remember at PKI was the big queue house with the ship and The Outer Limits on the TV (on a loop).
Themepark,3an69y,jpezzznuts,2,Mon Jun 22 14:59:56 2015 UTC,"The cycle at KD - if I remember correctly was about a 20 min loop that culminated in the ship in the queue house strobing and then loud rumble and then the entire queue would turn pitch black before ""rebooting"" and during the queue video there were other high treble blasts of sound and uncomfortable misery. The launch sequence however for the actual trains was something to behold as all the OPs would face the train stone faced military style in jumpsuits and the lights would dim and you would hear a deem growling hum before launch."
Themepark,3an69y,robotshoelaces,1 point,Tue Jun 23 03:56:11 2015 UTC,Sounds pretty similar to Kings Island's copy. I don't think I got to ride either one before the launch sequence got nerfed.

The Disneyland Resort has two theme parks - the original Disneyland park, opened in 1955 and the only Disney park built by Walt himself, and Disney California Adventure, a newer park that opened in 2001. The second one has more to do in terms of thrills - they've got a kickass roller coaster, one of the world's best drop rides, and THE world's best river rapids ride.  Another option is Knotts Berry Farm, about 15 minutes away from Disneyland. It's more of a pure thrill park with plenty of huge coasters.  I would honestly recommend California Adventure if you've never been to his area before; it has plenty of thrill rides as well as some of that unique Disney charm that sets those theme parks in a class of their own."
Themepark,3aekey,MountainMadman,3,Fri Jun 19 15:15:31 2015 UTC,I would also add that the Cars Radiator Springs Racers is another world class attraction with fun and incredible detail
Themepark,3aekey,Xenochrist,2,Fri Jun 19 17:00:02 2015 UTC,Disneyland and California's Adventure are two separate parks in the same resort area.  You can by individual tickets to either or park-hopper tickets which let you visit both parks on the same day but it's expensive.  If you're looking for exciting rides and only have one day I'd recommend Knott's Berry Farm (https://www.knotts.com/)

I'm actually blown away at how nice this site is. I can easily see this site rising in popularity with amusement park go-ers.   Suggestions:  -Maybe you can create an iOS or Android app to go alongside it, it would really help get this out to a larger audience, and make it super easy to use when in the park.  -Find a way to integrate Google AdSense. I usually don't tell people to do this, as I really hate ads, but you've done so well on this website that you really need to find a way to profit off of your good work. Just looking at the page, I can tell this took time and effort.  -Lastly, when I'm on the park browser page with the map at the top, anytime I scroll down or up on the page, regardless of what field the mouse is currently in, the map zooms in and out with the page scrolls. It takes a pretty good chunk of processing power out and causes the page to lag a bit. (on OSX Yosemite with Google Chrome installed).  Other than that, again, freaking NICE work."

I am currently working on an android app, which will hopefully be released quite soon, although I can't see an iOS app being made soon sadly. Again, unfortunately I am under 18 so setting up a google adsense account will have to wait for a couple of years :/ Originally the idea with the zooming in was to highlight to the user on the map where the park was, but clearly that is a bit useless now that the map is not always visible, so I'll remove that functionality.   Again thanks for taking the time to leave a comment."

Themepark,3a67nc,vinbel121,6,Wed Jun 17 20:20:15 2015 UTC,I wonder what rides will make the cut over at volcano Bay.   This will also start the rumours about what universal will do with the land. They own land about the area too so I expect there to be plenty of 3rd park talk as well.
Themepark,3a67nc,scottwalker88,3,Wed Jun 17 16:33:03 2015 UTC,I wonder how they could connect the parks.
Themepark,3a67nc,scottwalker88,5,Wed Jun 17 17:55:27 2015 UTC,"From what I've heard, this is the land at Wet n Wild that Universal own.  My idea although completely drastic would be to move the car park to the Wet n Wild plot and build a 3rd park on the old car park location.  I don't know if it would be possible or not but to build a monorail or subway system that will take you directly into Citywalk and Volcano Bay from the new car park. I imagine a subway system would be near impossible since Orlando is basically just a giant swamp.  Use the current Wet n Wild car park for the parking structure, they would have to build up to make sure there's enough capacity. Then use the Wet n Wild park area as a hub with transport to and from the parks plus take advantage of the giant lake by building a boardwalk with a few shops and restaurants.  This will also add a convenient access point for everybody on International Drive."

There's talk of the park expanding the lower lot and demolishing Mummy to do so, and a coaster like this could take it's place. There's also nothing major announced for Hollywood after Potter in 2016, too.  Edit: Not saying it's impossible to put this in Orlando (they might see it as a way to get around the metal detectors at the outdoor coasters like Hulk and Rockit), but it would have a bigger impact in the Hollywood park (not to mention, O-Town already has four launched coasters and a fifth at BGT, so it's not as unique)."

That would mean Mummy, F&F, and Gringotts coasters, that all have launches in them, would all be on the same street in a row.  From what I gather though, nothing will come of this Back to the Future concept. It feels like the work of a fan is all now that I've read more about it."

The docks needed to be made, all construction material shipped in, workers who need to be housed and fed on the island during construction. Plus transportation of animals from one island to the other. I could see the cost of the cloning going down drastically after they did one, but I think the cost of park construction would be more than the estimate."

That said, even without the flash pass, if you get off and hang around sometimes they'll let you fill in the inevitable leftover seats"
Themepark,39r66b,JDN87,3,Sun Jun 14 09:56:02 2015 UTC,"IMO the flash passes are a waste for Magic Mountain... I don't know what other park lines are, but the ones for magic mountain are pretty low 2Hrs Max. And there is like a ""route"" you can take around the park to get to every ride without having to wait the 2 hours. That being said, the flash passes are expensive for a reason. It's cutting. If they were cheap, everyone would have one. Theres' a reason they are expensive. If they had a season long one, for the same price, everyone would have one aswell. It's a Price > Demand scenario. If you do happen to be going to magic mountain, head left and get on x2 Asap, then go around the back of the park, then hit twisted collosus right after noon, lines are down because people are out eating. :P Have done this 3 times and haven't had to wait longer than 1 hour on any ride unless it was down."
Themepark,39r66b,MiniMoose12,2,Sun Jun 14 00:29:57 2015 UTC,"Since when is a ""2 hour max"" line low? That's ridiculous.  When I went to magic mountain back in 2005 (on the 4th of July no less), the only 2 hour line was the X-Scream."
Themepark,39r66b,exoscoriae,1 point,Sun Jun 14 15:26:10 2015 UTC,"2 Hours MAX is referring to X, hence why you go there first to avoid the line stacking up. All the other rides are <1hour waits after that. Get there when the park opens, go straight to X2, get on in 30 minutes."
Themepark,39p0fy,cheesethrower,5,Sat Jun 13 10:45:29 2015 UTC,"Chances are he wasn't even a maintenance guy for Flight Deck.  He probably wasn't familiar with the ride, a guest asked him if he could fetch their dropped phone, and he said yes.    Maintenance guys sometimes just think they can go anywhere they want, whenever they want.  He's lucky to still have his life.  I know at Cedar Point, when the employees show up to a ride in the morning, they go and change all the ride area locks to a lock that only the ride supervisor has the key to, so that maintenance can't go in the ride area.  At SeaWorld, they have a special lock and key setup that only lets you unlock the ride areas by turning off the ride, and using the ride power key to remove the ride area keys."
Themepark,39p0fy,Woirol,3,Sat Jun 13 12:20:34 2015 UTC,I'm certain this park has a lock out tag out-type system where in order to access the ride path it cannot be running. These types of accidents happen every few years and are a scary reminder to not take shortcuts with safety.

There were so many neat references throughout the movie. Literally LOL'd when I saw the magicbands. And when I saw the tank I immediately thought of Shamu Stadium (I hope Sea World was taking notes). I really hope that some of the stuff (or at least something new Jurassic World related) can make it's way over to Islands of Adventure.

Themepark,39fl1r,ARfandude,4,Thu Jun 11 11:43:29 2015 UTC,"3 day park to park tickets and you're staying onsite? You'll be able to do everything easily, especially with the complimentary park hoppers you get for being onsite. You should do the Harry Potter parts in the morning to avoid crowds. Do Diagon Alley one morning, run to gringotts, explore, take the hog warts express to Hogwarts and ride the forbidden journey (if the line is above 45 minutes I would say it's average length. Anything under is great). After that you can literally do anything. I went last year opening weekend for Diagon Alley and stayed on site and rode everything in both parks that weekend thanks to the express passes. If you're a big fan of the Harry Potter series you should REALLY watch the little shows they have in Diagon alley. The tale of 3 brothers is my favorite but the fountain of fair fortune is great too! Explore the entire area. The interactive wands are also a blast, for both kids and adults.   I think you have a pretty good idea of what to do already! Have an awesome time!   Edit:  Just saw you're getting there in the afternoon. I would say focus on rides that accept the express pass (maybe the water rides in islands of adventure if you're not big on walking around wet during the other two days). When you check into the hotel let the front desk know you're planning on going to the parks and where to collect your express pass. They'll point you to some machines you just swipe your room key and it takes a picture of you to use for express passes. :)  Edit 2:  You should also know the ride to Hogwarts on the Hogwarts express and the ride back are different so be sure to do both!"
Themepark,39fl1r,ohemgrace,3,Thu Jun 11 13:55:25 2015 UTC,DO THE MUMMY!   Theres usually around a 10-20 minute wait towards the middle of the day and the ride is by far one of my favourite in the park!
Themepark,39fl1r,NumbersArentMy30,3,Thu Jun 11 19:53:56 2015 UTC,"I went on a WDW/Universal trip and spent 2 days at Uni/IoA and it was more than enough time to do everything in both parks TWICE! Granted this was before the second HP expansion and on days with no crowds.  With 3 days I think you should take your time with everything, no rushing and explore all there is to offer. Do the things you like a lot twice. You'll have a great time. Enjoy"
Themepark,39fl1r,alienware99,3,Thu Jun 11 14:14:48 2015 UTC,"My suggestion: don't skip anything. Disaster, Fear Factor, Terminator 2: 3D, Horror Make-Up Show, the Raptor Encounter, Cat in the Hat, Dr Doom, Discovery Center, Sindbad, etc. A lot has changed in 15 years, and who knows what will be the next ride to close, so see and do everything.  I would also set aside some time to eat in the parks (Finnegan's, Mythos, Confiscos), as they're really good values (a little more than quick service food, but drink refills and much better food and atmosphere). I also recommend the refillable bottles they have that use Coke Freestyle machines all over both parks (and you can get them filled with soda or Icees for a small fee at the carts don't have the Freestyle machines)"

For rides like Top Thrill Dragster they collect data each run to inform the next.  Everything from train weight, temperature, humidity, and loads of other variables are used to determine how hard the train should launch to hopefully get over the hill."
Themepark,38rsvi,powderp,1 point,Sat Jun 6 07:06:14 2015 UTC,That's what I kind of hoped. I wonder if they'd make it available? I'm a grad student in statistics and I'd love to get my hands on that data.
Themepark,38rsvi,powderp,3,Sat Jun 6 07:18:44 2015 UTC,"I don't imagine so, doesn't seem like they'd have much incentive to, but on the other hand it doesn't seem like that data would be particularly proprietary or secretive.  I expect your best bet would be to try to find a Cedar Point/Cedar Fair/Six Flags engineering contact.  Might have better luck in getting them to help if they're willing to at all if you contact them in the off season, rather than in the middle of peak season."

Themepark,38e442,EricGarbo,7,Wed Jun 3 16:54:30 2015 UTC,"Not to mention that that even if it's an employee error this should have been prevented by the rides safety systems.   Controls for modern rides use industrial-grade solutions to provide extreme amounts of reliability, and if for instance a sensor fails or something else seems off, either the main control systems or a separate secondary safety monitoring shuts everything down.   That's what tends to happen when a ride ""breaks down"". A safety system detects an anomaly and lets the system ""fail gracefully"" way before things actually go wrong."

Themepark,38e442,Leftism,3,Thu Jun 4 20:16:45 2015 UTC,"My guess is that the ride was in manual mode and there is no safety systems there, for a reason - so the technician/mechanic (NOT ride operator) can do what he wants with the ride). Manual mode should not be used when people are on the ride. It could happen that someone switched the ride to the manual mode so they could solve the problem and then manualy cleared the sector and send the second train in the occupied sector (but the system did nothing to prevent this because the ride was in manual mode). It's just a speculation, but I think this is much more likely to happen than computer bug or malfunction."

Themepark,387vev,ROGERS-SONGS,8,Tue Jun 2 14:17:55 2015 UTC,"Been on the ride a lot, I can tell where the cars have collided, it's just after a few big loops right over concrete also near the exit and shop. Unfortunately none of my pictures can show this area well enough. Looks like the car has came straight down from a loop into the empty one. The queue is directly underneath the ride but not where these cars would be. I don't understand why after sending out a test empty car they wouldn't wait until that car had returned before sending one out with guests on? Witnesses on BBC say it sounded like a car crash, the riders must be terrified I just hope they get off safe and the staff are coping with the situation."
Themepark,387vev,KingdaToro,13,Tue Jun 2 15:12:45 2015 UTC,"I don't understand why after sending out a test empty car they wouldn't wait until that car had returned before sending one out with guests on?   Because you don't need to. All roller coasters have what's called a block system that's made to prevent exactly this sort of thing. The track is divided into sections called blocks, the end of each block has some way of stopping and restarting a train. Using sensors on the track, the ride's computer is able to tell whether or not there is a train in each block. When a train reaches the end of a block, it will be stopped if the next block is occupied and will only be restarted once the next block is clear.   This system is extremely robust and failsafe, and is tested for proper operation before the coaster opens each day. In fact, it's the main reason coasters sometimes get stuck on the lift. If even one of the sensors in the block after the lift registers a false positive, the computer will think there's a train there and stop the lift to prevent the next train from entering that block.  The only way to cause a collision like this is to run the coaster in maintenance mode, in which you have direct control over all the brakes and transport devices (drive tires and lifts) and the block system is not active. Ride operators don't even have the keys necessary to enable this mode (only mechanics do), and it's always strictly forbidden to have anyone on the ride when it's in maintenance mode."
Themepark,387vev,bchris24,6,Tue Jun 2 15:33:17 2015 UTC,"So would you say then it's possible that the empty train cleared the block in a position like on a hill or so, causing it to roll back into the already cleared block?"
Themepark,387vev,KingdaToro,6,Tue Jun 2 16:19:10 2015 UTC,"A hill will never be the end of a block. Every block needs a way of stopping and restarting a train. On a coaster designed for two train operation, the station will be one block, the lift another, and all the rest of the track including the brake run before the station will be the third block. A three-train coaster will have a mid-course brake run (MCBR) that divides the main part of the track into two blocks, and an additional brake block before the station so that a train won't stop on the MCBR if the station and brake run are both occupied. The end of every block will always have at least one catwalk since the coaster is designed to stop there and may need to be evacuated from there.  Coasters that run individual cars (i.e. Wild Mouse) have LOTS of MCBRs in order to run lots of cars. You'll notice this when riding one, any flat part of the track with brakes and a catwalk is the end of a block."
Themepark,387vev,bchris24,2,Tue Jun 2 16:32:12 2015 UTC,Yeah i assumed as much. I'm just trying to figure out how in this day and age a block could have gotten two trains on it at once. Had to have been a catastrophic error in the block system.
Themepark,387vev,KingdaToro,3,Tue Jun 2 16:36:24 2015 UTC,"It would have been tested and found to work properly that very morning.

The lift automatically stops when the train nears the top, as the track block is still occupied by the train on the brake run.  Really, the most likely explanation is that it was in maintenance mode, and they screwed up badly by not only putting people on it, but by sending it into an occupied block."
Themepark,387vev,Kegit,1 point,Tue Jun 2 16:42:05 2015 UTC,"Are the track sensors tested each morning for reacting when a train is in a section? It wouldn't be difficult to do - during a test run, the computer control just has to check if each sensor gives a ""train is present"" message. Do you know whether this is tested daily?"
Themepark,387vev,KingdaToro,3,Tue Jun 2 20:49:34 2015 UTC,"Yes, in fact this happens automatically and constantly during operation. The computer knows where all the sensors are and how long the trains are, and there are multiple sensors in each important area, namely the end of each block. Let's say a train is nearing the top of the lift, which has three sensors in order. If the computer sees sensor 1 register then sensor 3 register, it knows sensor 2 must be bad since it knows the position of the train from the other sensors. This would cause an automatic ride stop."

Themepark,387vev,RealNotFake,1 point,Tue Jun 2 15:58:08 2015 UTC,"If there was one or more failed track sensors that were reporting an incorrect state to the controller, that could also explain why the system allowed the train to continue into a dangerous block. If that was the case it's likely the sensor would have been dead for a while and it took that specific set of circumstances for the problem to actually manifest."
Themepark,387vev,KingdaToro,1 point,Tue Jun 2 17:14:00 2015 UTC,"This couldn't happen either. A dead sensor or one not picking up the train would cause the computer to stop the ride as soon as it saw that the other sensors near it were picking up the train but the bad one wasn't, and the bad sensor would have to be replaced before the ride could reopen. A sensor giving a false positive reading would immediately cause its block to register as occupied, which would also stop the ride. Ride operators call this a ""ghost train""."
Themepark,387vev,RealNotFake,1 point,Wed Jun 3 00:27:59 2015 UTC,Depends on how many sensors and spacing and how the software was designed. At this point all of the potential scenarios we could dream up are unlikely - if it was likely then you would hear about crashes like this a helluva lot more often.
Themepark,387vev,b2311e,3,Wed Jun 3 15:26:23 2015 UTC,"Shouldn't be possible because of the block system for two to collide anyway, even if one train had stalled.  Sounds like perhaps a brake issue?"
Themepark,387vev,ROGERS-SONGS,4,Tue Jun 2 15:26:42 2015 UTC,"Could be, there was other witness reports that one of the wheels from the empty car flew back into a rider's face (one of the images going around and the guy's face in the front row is red) also that the front panel of one of the cars came off. I've went to Alton Towers the past 3 years in a row, only not going this year because we're going to Orlando theme parks instead...Whole thing is awful."
Themepark,387vev,KingdaToro,3,Tue Jun 2 15:32:46 2015 UTC,"Coaster brakes are designed to be failsafe. Any malfunction or power loss will cause the brakes to close. They're inspected for wear every morning, so there's no way they'd be worn down enough to fail to stop a train."

Themepark,387vev,KingdaToro,2,Tue Jun 2 17:16:09 2015 UTC,"Not really. On any lift, the highest point of the lift is the beginning of the next block. A properly functioning block system will ALWAYS stop the lift before the train can go over the top if the next block is occupied."

The ride shut for four days in July 2013 after a piece fell off the track, and 48 people had to be rescued. It closed again in August 2013 for five days due to a ""technical issue"". In November 2013 it closed for five days after wheels fell off and hit four people in the front carriage.

Themepark,389959,Woirol,4,Tue Jun 2 18:55:50 2015 UTC,Seems like too much camera movement for that pace. Something like that would require the camera to remain fairly level and straight forward rather than constantly panning left and right. It moves too much to actually focus on anything.

It was something I tried and it worked better than I had thought.  But I know that I can learn from it and I plan on doing some more test videos and then start potentially uploading some cool stuff.
Themepark,389959,exoscoriae,1 point,Wed Jun 3 03:43:15 2015 UTC,"No worries. It looks like it would be a great video on it's own. I know I was winging my head all over the place when I first went in. The way the buildings lean in on you makes it impossible to see everything at once.   I think a stable POV, almost like a person on rails, with occasional pans towards major objects of interest would be really interesting to see. Ultimately, I would think, that a good hyperlapse would want the world itself to look static with all the people moving quickly through it."
Themepark,38903r,Vagfilla,2,Tue Jun 2 18:07:18 2015 UTC,"Well, I don't know about Kennywood, but for Cedar Point there is always the plethora of on site hotels that give you early access to the park.  You can find those on their site.    As for Kings Island, the only two I can think of that are within walking distance would be Great Wolf Lodge which is literally next door and has a walking path.  I believe they have deals for discounted tickets.  There's a place on their site for unpublished package deals.  They may have shuttles, but you'd have to inquire at the hotel I'd imagine.  For closeness, Great Wolf Lodge can't be beat, but for price, well that's another story."

This year we're staying in one of the cabins at lighthouse point. If you are looking for a reasonable price, I'd check out the sand castle suites and hotel breakers. Your only option for walking to KI is the Great Wolf, but I believe there are a couple other hotels a bit further down towards the highway if you don't mind a hike.

Themepark,37skw9,TheQuassitworsh,8,Sat May 30 10:54:10 2015 UTC,"Robb Alvey made a good point a while back, and it's basically that a park done right has no kids sections.  Kids and families shouldn't be something to shuffle into the corner away from the rest of the patrons.  An effective park layout incorporates high thrills right along side attractions gears at a less thrill seeking audience.    Also, this removes the idea of having attractions for kids at all.  The majority of the attractions and areas should be stimulating for everyone who enters the park.  In the words of Walt Disney at the opening of Disneyland:   To all who come to this happy place: Welcome. Disneyland is your land. Here, age relives fond memories of the past, and here youth may savor the challenge and promise of the future. Disneyland is dedicated to the ideals, the dreams, and the hard facts that have created America, with the hope that it will be a source of joy and inspiration to all the world.   The park is for everyone.  Not just the thrill seeker or the family, people who hate/only like water rides, etc.  Everyone."

I'm not arguing with you and saying you're wrong about how the situation was handled; but you're still remembering something from six years ago, so it clearly bothered you.

They acted like they didn't want to be there. They didn't seem to CARE about the fact that we needed help with whatever it was we needed help with.   One of the other things that bothered me a LOT at the time was the fact that the park's parking garage is on the other side of a giant freaking shopping mall. We were renting a park stroller at the time, which of course you can't take out of the park and trying to get an exhausted 5 yr old to walk the two miles (maybe it wasn't that far, but it sure FELT that far) from the park's entrance to the car was the worst part of every single day.

Themepark,37smx8,RichAfterTaxes,2,Sat May 30 01:43:58 2015 UTC,"I highly recommend beginning with Iron Dragon or Gatekeeper. Both are really enjoyable and smooth, and Gatekeeper in particular is more of a ""height of luxury"" experience than an intense one.   Blue Streak is a very good option as well. I recommend against starting with Raptor or Mean Streak, though."
Themepark,37smx8,CustomMadeGJ,2,Sat May 30 03:15:12 2015 UTC,"This guys' got all the right answers. Perfect battle plan. there's also Cedar Creek Mine Train for a smaller experience. Just grit your teeth and hit that first big one, it'll be such a rush you'l love it."
Themepark,37smx8,pibbsman,1 point,Sat May 30 04:22:13 2015 UTC,"Stay away from mean streak. That'll scare you off for sure. Gemini is good to start with. But, YMMV. My wife was always terrified of coasters when we first started going to parks. One year, I took her to Six flags great adventure and threw her on kingda ka first ride of the morning. Got it out of her system and she's never looked back. Did the same thing with El Toro last year to another friend who was terrified of coasters. You'll be fine, and have a great time."
Themepark,37smx8,sylvester_0,1 point,Wed Jun 10 01:07:00 2015 UTC,"Depending on your build, Gatekeeper can be really uncomfortable. By the time the train hits the mcbr I'm ready to be DONE because the restraint vest is digging into my collar bones. I'll do that ride hesitantly if someone else wants to do it and I'll never suggest that we do it. I treated mantis in a similar fashion because it just wasn't enjoyable for me.  Anyway, the suggestion to start with a smooth coaster is a good one. I'd throw in bluestreak as a suggestion too because it's pretty tame. For building up, I'd recommend Maverick next (just anticipate the turns to avoid head banging.) That ride isn't super high/intimidating and is an all out blast!"
Themepark,37smx8,abnormalend,2,Sat May 30 15:57:48 2015 UTC,"I feel like starting with gatekeeper is the ""tear off the band-aid"" version of getting over it.  It's a smooth ride, but for somebody who is scared it looks very intimidating.  Iron Dragon is a great first choice.  I would consider Gemini before Gatekeeper too, maybe even Wicked Twister.  I guess it depends on how scary inversions are to a person."
Themepark,37smx8,abnormalend,1 point,Sat May 30 15:04:28 2015 UTC,"Thank you, I've been on Iron Dragon and Gemini and I loved both, but those are kinda not close to the gate, XD I once chickened out of Gatekeeper, but this time i'll go on, how long do you think lines are for Gatekeeper? I know wicked usually doesn't have much of a line"
Themepark,37smx8,vinbel121,1 point,Sat May 30 15:08:27 2015 UTC,"When you say ""close to the gate"" it makes me think you're talking about getting there at park open and rushing to the closest one.  If that's you're concern, one option is parking in back (by Gemini) and going in the resort entrance.  That is right by the Magnum station, and starts you in the back of the park while most people are up front."

Themepark,37ndt7,sverb,7,Thu May 28 22:25:39 2015 UTC,"Universal just needs to work on the customer service that brings Disney people back.  Universal has the rides and the intellectual properties to be the adult park of choice, but they need to up their service game."
Themepark,37ndt7,laur2d2,9,Fri May 29 14:04:25 2015 UTC,Annual visitor reports say otherwise. Disney is kicking their ass.
Themepark,37ndt7,bryan_rothwell,5,Fri May 29 01:53:38 2015 UTC,"I think the next few years will be interesting. This water park is going to change things along with the new hotels being built.  Disney used to be a one stop shop, there was enough to do at the parks, the transport system worked well enough that you may not need a car especially if you're staying on site. However I think Disney has started to become stale. Avatar land is still a long way off, the recent expansion at The Magic Kingdom was personally underwhelming and Star Wars Land could be more than 3 years away from becoming a reality.  Universal on the other hand is building a new ride every year Transformers in 2013, Harry Potter in 2014, Kong in late 2015/early 2016, Volcano Bay in 2017 and Comcast have confirmed that they're prepared to invest heavily by promising a new ride every year until 2018.  The Orlando flexticket is almost a $100 cheaper than a Disney ticket for the same period.  Don't get me wrong, I love Disney but I'm feeling like i'm not their target audience because I'm not a 6 year old girl, where as Harry Potter is attracting a lot of attention from both sexes of teenagers and adults. The 3 biggest properties that Disney have are: Pixar, Star Wars and Marvel. Pixar seems under used, I would have loved to have seen the Monsters, Inc coaster but I doubt we ever will now, Star Wars like I said is a long way off and Marvel is currently a no go area, which Universal is getting all the benefit from.  On the Marvel front, it's a shitty situation, Disney can't build anything from Marvel because they would be breaking their contract with Universal and Universal can't build anything related to Marvel without first getting permission from Disney, which they will of course reject. The area is going to become old and stale soon which is a shame because there is so much potential.   The real plus side to all this, is that as a customer, competition is good and I think if Disney get a bit of a scare, they might just pull off something incredible. I don't think Disney will ever really be worried, Universal is never going to overtake them and their attendance numbers are always rising, however their market share is dropping. Their 50 year anniversary is approaching in 2021 and I'm sure they will want all the parks in pristine condition which means construction needs to start quickly and complete on time."
Themepark,37ndt7,scottwalker88,2,Fri May 29 21:55:47 2015 UTC,"Universal's rides have been pretty underwhelming lately too in my opinion. It's become more of a motion simulator park lately with Transformers, Spiderman, Forbidden Journey, and even Gringott's is a little on the motion simulator side of things.  But then again, Disney is adding a motion simulator ride for Avatar... hopefully they do better than Universal in that aspect."
Themepark,37ndt7,bryan_rothwell,3,Mon Jun 1 07:21:50 2015 UTC,"It does seem to be a growing tend in Orlando recently. I'm hoping that Kong brings about a new era of relying less on screens and 3D and brings back some great sets and animatronics.  I can kind of understand Universals reasoning for it recently, Tranformers was already fairly succcesful in their other parks, The Simpsons was basically using the old BTTF system and Harry Potter was ticking as many boxes in a single attraction as possible and they managed to create these attractions in a relatively small area quickly.  I also think Forbidden Journey was built out of necessity at the time, they had the rights to one of the hottest properties in the world and had just made a successful bid to exclusivity use the robocoaster technology. I don't think they over did the screens but if it's anything like it's Japanese counter part, it will be 3D soon."
Themepark,37ndt7,scottwalker88,4,Mon Jun 1 22:57:27 2015 UTC,"It's all a matter of opinion. Disney World isn't building anything really fresh or taking risks anymore, except for Avatar Land. But that's a rare example of Disney stepping outside the usual theme park comfort zone in the last decade.  And the one thing the Internet seems to be unanimous about (a Star Wars Land) is absent while they wait to count box office receipts.  Edit: Just realized, maybe you're talking about TEA/AECOM numbers. Which aren't out yet for 2014. But even if they were, I wouldn't put the most faith in them, as Disney doesn't report actuals. The numbers shown there are estimates based on year-end financial reporting and not the actual turnstile clicks."
Themepark,37ndt7,tideblue,7,Fri May 29 03:28:55 2015 UTC,"All four parks are supposed to be going through pretty big changes soon. I believe Magic Kingdom's ""big change"" was New Fantasy Land. Hollywood Studios (soon to be renamed) will likely get the Star Wars area. AK is doing Avatar. Now we just have to wait on Epcot. I think Epcot will see something really great added to the park in the coming years simply because it needs it the most in my opinion. Epcot has been a little dull compared to the other parks and could definitely use a new addition. And no, I don't consider the Frozen attraction to be a large addition to the park. I'm thinking Future World side will see something large."
Themepark,37ndt7,bryan_rothwell,6,Fri May 29 06:46:00 2015 UTC,"Avatar is a great example! Announced in 2011, Avatar's completion date is in 2017. Volcano Bay was announced yesterday, and will open around the same time. Which sounds more productive?"
Themepark,37ndt7,tideblue,2,Fri May 29 12:34:36 2015 UTC,"Which sounds like it requires more attention to detail? I'll admit it took Disney a while to get the project rolling, though."
Themepark,37ndt7,bryan_rothwell,3,Fri May 29 19:51:45 2015 UTC,We shall see the detail up close in 2017. I'm still not sold on the Avatar project (more excited for the night time show).
Themepark,37ndt7,tideblue,3,Fri May 29 20:19:30 2015 UTC,"Mystic Manor was pretty fresh and risky. The entire controls done on that ride, even though originally implemented in Pooh's Hunny Hunt, is something that utilized a whole new ride idea. The possibilities are endless with the ride system."
Themepark,37ndt7,rcmolloy,2,Fri May 29 03:41:01 2015 UTC,"Mystic Manor isn't found at Disney World. It's the ""Haunted Mansion"" concept for the park. Not much originality to the attractions they're opening up stateside.  Speaking of HKDL, did you ever see the Splash Mountain-style Pirates ride they had concept art for, or the Glacier Bay plan (where Toy Story Land was later built)?"
Themepark,37ndt7,tideblue,3,Fri May 29 03:49:16 2015 UTC,"Having been to Universal this last weekend, I don't know if I agree with this. Universal has several areas that seem to be so outdated and boring that it's practically unused by guests. So many rides needed updating or at least a fresh coat of paint on many areas. While my visit was 99% for Wizarding World, I think they really neglected the rest of the park that desperately needed some tlc."

Themepark,37ndt7,littlemissjess,2,Fri May 29 09:09:13 2015 UTC,"Where's the concept art or opening date? Not a shovel of dirt has moved on this project, so it's still up in the air."
Themepark,37ndt7,tideblue,1 point,Fri May 29 12:25:24 2015 UTC,"Ah yes you are right! We know that they are investing a significant amount of money in (what is currently) hollywood studios, and that they've closed some of the older attractions to prepare for this.  We're expecting an official announcement on it by the end of the year, but considering cars land was very heavily implied and then axed we could see a change of heart with this project too. However as it stands, all signs point to go for star wars expansion, for example here's an interview with Bob iger in which he mentions ""a far greater presence of star wars at...orlando"".  But like you said, as no ground breaking has happened, and this could be talking about /anything/ Star wars related, not specifically a themed area, it's not concrete yet. Let's keep fingers crossed!   http://www.bloomberg.com/news/videos/b/25c3d3f9-c60e-4912-8950-2994ac996ff8"
Themepark,37ndt7,littlemissjess,2,Fri May 29 13:48:21 2015 UTC,"The slowness of this whole thing is the problem. If they want to hold off on Star Wars until after the new movies debut, that's okay. But it's a park with five rides, last of which (Toy Story Mania) was added in 2008. I don't want them waiting until 2018 or later to add more attractions to the park."
Themepark,37ltq6,mktuba,2,Thu May 28 15:46:38 2015 UTC,Oh you want to get rid of your Volcano water slide Disney?  that's ok Universal will just make one to fill the demand.

Themepark,37gvwf,tideblue,3,Wed May 27 15:21:59 2015 UTC,How about they build some rides instead of spending all their time and money on figuring out ways to extract more money from people?
Themepark,37gvwf,DadsinGrads,2,Wed May 27 19:40:16 2015 UTC,I don't think the issue is Disney not building enough rides or putting effort into their parks. I'm not really a Disney fan but I'll admit that their parks are top notch for what they are. That doesn't mean that expecting people to pay over $100 for a ticket isn't ridiculous because it absolutely is.
Themepark,37gvwf,Imaginos64,2,Wed May 27 22:40:04 2015 UTC,Tickets are already over $100.
Themepark,37gvwf,Imaginos64,1 point,Wed May 27 22:48:07 2015 UTC,Oh I know and I think that's crazy. I guess they know that people may grumble but they'll still fork over the money.
Themepark,37gvwf,huntergreenhoodie,3,Wed May 27 22:59:06 2015 UTC,"They just opened Seven Dwarfs and finished a Fantasyland upgrade. They are also changing Maelstrom to Frozen. Oh ya, they are also working on Avatar. That enough for now? No?  Let's also not forget Disney is more than just rides because they're also working on the upgrade of Downtown Disney.    (I left out all the rumours going around right now since nothing is confirmed but look at the rumours regarding Hollywood Studios)"
Themepark,37gvwf,VicariousFan,2,Wed May 27 19:56:25 2015 UTC,"in the time it took to open just the Fantasy Land Expansion Universal has opened the new Despicable Me ride, Transformers, the new Simpsons Area, and the whole new Harry Potter land.   They still have the new Kong and another unannounced project in the works, which will probably be done before Avatar land is open.  I also wouldn't call what they are doing to Downtown Disney an Upgrade but Universal is also working on an upgrade as well.   All of that with out raising their price.     Well if Disney doesn't want the market Universal is more then happy to come in and take it."
Themepark,37gvwf,huntergreenhoodie,2,Thu May 28 10:29:20 2015 UTC,"All of that with out raising their price.      In 2012, Universal raised prices from $85 to $88 In 2013, they raised it to $92 (becoming the first to pass the $90 point) In 2014, they raised it to $96 In 2015, they raised it to $102    Universal has been keeping up with Disney and smart money says that if Disney moves to premium pricing, Universal will follow suit.    Sources: Universal Orlando raises prices: $102 for 1-day, 1-park pass Theme Park Inflation: Universal Orlando Becomes First to Cross $90 Admission Mark"
Themepark,37gvwf,VicariousFan,1 point,Thu May 28 11:54:14 2015 UTC,not what I meant.  I'm saying Universal is increasing value while Disney has not.    No smart money is on Universal not doing that as they want the market.
Themepark,37gvwf,huntergreenhoodie,2,Thu May 28 22:45:08 2015 UTC,"How is Disney not increasing value? Saying that the things they are adding or upgrading didn't add any value to the park comes off as very Universal fanboyish.    Universal already has the market; they share it with Disney.  Their additions over the past few years have really helped them take more of a share of it. Thinking that they won't switch to premium pricing if Disney does is just stubbornness. When one Orlando park raises prices, the others follow suit. You can mark my words, if Disney goes through with the idea, Universal will follow suit. Maybe not right away so they can say ""hey, look at us! We still have one price tickets"" but give it a year and they'll be doing it too."
Themepark,37gvwf,VicariousFan,1 point,Thu May 28 22:59:58 2015 UTC,"you're joking right?  In the past what 5 years we have gotten 2 new rides in 1 park.   That's not exactly increasing value.   They have also removed a lot of street performers, increased prices of almost everything across the board, removed benefits from the Annual Pass, and made lines longer with My Magic +.    We aren't talking about simply raising prices here we are talking about changing the pricing model entirely, that is something that Universal will do.   You don't see Universal adding Magic Bands do you?"
Themepark,37gvwf,huntergreenhoodie,1 point,Fri May 29 05:04:05 2015 UTC,"There's a lot more to a place like WDW than the rides. Along with the two aforementioned rides, they added restaurants that have been getting nothing but great reviews, doubled the capacity on Dumbo while adding an interactive queue, and added am expanded princess meet and greet facility. In the past 5 years they also refurbed Test Track and added new restaurants at EPCOT. If you're only in it for the rides then obviously we're going to continue to disagree.    Why wouldn't Universal add a form of Magic Bands? With the announcement of Volcano Bay and the fact they're becoming more of a mega resort, I can see the possibility of it happening. Maybe not in the exact way Disney has but something that ends up being your room key, credit card, and park tickets is more convenient and would make it easier for their guests to spend money. I'll be shocked if they don't roll out a cashless wristband at VB and eventually across the resort."
Themepark,37gvwf,VicariousFan,1 point,Fri May 29 19:52:58 2015 UTC,"are you joking?  because magic bands are a huge failure.  2 billion reported on tech that doesn't even work properly.    Its not selling merchendise like they had planed to make up the cost.   Its so bad Disneyland doesn't even want it.   If anything they will move to just an app as its cheaper and the tech is far superior   As far as restaurants and refurbishments Universal has done the same thing adding new restaurants and refurbishing rides like Spiderman.   I wouldn't add Meet and Greets as a plus at all, especially when they have 4 hour lines.   Also capacity has gone down since moving Dumbo."
Themepark,37gvwf,VicariousFan,1 point,Fri May 29 20:18:32 2015 UTC,I should also add Disney has been discouraging Park Hopping and removed no expiration date tickets thus again lowering the actual value of the tickets while increasing the price.
Themepark,37gvwf,huntergreenhoodie,5,Sat May 30 19:18:19 2015 UTC,"There's not enough new stuff to justify a price hike of that size. They already had the most expensive parks, and only want to fleece you more.  Edit: There's a twenty dollar difference between Bronze and Gold for MK tickets. You're telling me you'd get your money's worth out of that extra $20/person if you went at that time?"
Themepark,37gvwf,huntergreenhoodie,3,Wed May 27 21:33:37 2015 UTC,"They would certainly not be the first to have premium pricing.  Sports teams do it all the time; a good team in town? Expect ticket prices to be higher.  They're just bringing it to the amusement industry.    I'm not saying it's right or fair, but it does make sense. High time puts more strain on the parks and operations, so charging more just covers it (not like their profits don't already, this would just give them more).    As for new stuff, I'd say an entire new land at one park, a completely updated one at another, the modification of one to a very popular theme, and an expanded downtown area is well enough for new things. Plus, if rumours are true about Star Wars and/or Cars coming to Hollywood Studios, then that would also go towards justifying it"

Went and did the HHN, then came back and did the whole park during the day.  After that, we just kinda... gave up. There wasn't enough to justify the second day there and we were already pretty bored. Riding The Mummy multiple times proved to be fun up until the 3rd time, then we spent the rest of the trip shopping. I should have bought the second day for Six Flags or something."

Themepark,375alc,chaddict,2,Mon May 25 02:06:59 2015 UTC,Awesome.  Thanks for the heads up. Im loving everything they have done recently.  Still completely blown away by The Matterhorn upgrade.
Themepark,375alc,dandillion,7,Mon May 25 02:59:16 2015 UTC,"The Matterhorn just reopened this weekend with a major update, the update of the abominable snowman. A very enhanced animatronic to the prior yeti.  Haunted Mansion was updated earlier this month with the re-addition of the Hat Box ghost. You could look up the history of this segment. In short, there were reports of this ghost being in the attraction opening day.  The effect did not work properly and disappeared after only 1 or 2 days.  The only proof of this is an extremely grainy video.  The images of the ghost have stayed in pictures in the mansion and merchandise. There have been countless rumors of his return over the years and he has gained a cult following.  Both of these updates, along with Peter Pan opening in July, were released under the marketing of Disneyland's Diamond celebration, as the park turns 60 this summer.  Indy was updated last year, I believe.  Also looks great. That attraction was slowly losing some flare as more and more effects failed to worked properly. The updates definitely brought new life back into the ride."
Themepark,375alc,dandillion,3,Mon May 25 09:32:44 2015 UTC,"Thanks for that list.  Im curious, do you know of a place(website, youtube channel, subreddit) that has vintage and modern ride-through of Disney attractions?  Looking into the evolution of the Matterhorn has been incredibly fun for me.  I havnt been to Disneyland in over 10 years, but it would be awesome to compare past ride throughs with the current upgrade."
Themepark,375alc,BlueVerse,2,Mon May 25 09:45:13 2015 UTC,"There are definitely scatter videos through out youtube, hard for me to point out a specific channel right now.

Themepark,370ynm,tingmothy,4,Sat May 23 21:09:35 2015 UTC,See http://easywdw.com Josh maintains an awesome set of calendars on the side bar :) should help you plan!
Themepark,370ynm,Trekkie101,3,Sat May 23 22:27:10 2015 UTC,"Seconded to check the crowd calendar. You didn't say when you were going or where you were staying but during the summer, it is busy all week at all the parks. Some days may be a little slower but won't make a huge difference IMO. Extra Magic hours at a Disney park usually means it will be busier, so avoid those days, unless you are staying on property. That early or late hour or two can be a great time to be in the parks, but the overall crowds can be a killer those days. You can also pay for the park hopper option, which I love. One park too busy? Hop a bus or drive to another. But that of course costs extra.   For Disney, make sure to get you tickets before you go and book the fast passes as early as you can. You get 3 before you go to the park and then go to a booth to get more while at the park. But all the headliner rides will most likely be gone after you use the first 3. You can also switch the fast pass if you decide you didn't get enough of one park. Epcot, while not my favorite, is huge, and for those that have never been, they often feel more time is needed there.   If you are staying in hotels, considering staying at a Universal resort at least for one night if you don't mind moving hotels. All but the Cabana bay will give you the express pass for free. One night stay gives you two days express pass. They don't work on HP rides but you also get in an hour early. It is a great way to beat the crowds.  A lot of people end up leaving the park after the morning when crowds get bad and come back later in the day. Being older, you can probably stay late at Magic Kingdom and get a lot done after the fireworks. I go late on Friday and Saturday nights often and it isn't bad after 9 or so. Some weekends they are open until midnight or 1.   Make sure to use the apps in the parks. It is nice to be able to check wait times while there. Disneys app will tell you wait times anywhere, but Universals app needs to have you on property to give you that info, which can suck for a local like me who wants to decide if I want to drive over there."
Themepark,370ynm,Ofreo,2,Sun May 24 02:21:11 2015 UTC,Never go to magic kingdom on a Saturday unless a big event took place the day before. It will always be busy.
Themepark,370ynm,EvanAwesome,2,Sun May 24 00:07:13 2015 UTC,"Seconded, if you can go to Magic Kingdom during the week do that.."

Themepark,36zvy5,elmatador12,1 point,Sat May 23 23:51:06 2015 UTC,it's sounds like a time share sell . . .
Themepark,36zvy5,ADBlueRanger,1 point,Sat May 23 22:46:33 2015 UTC,"Definitely time share. Having said that, I've read that they will follow through with everything as long as you can handle an extremely pressure filled sales pitch and say no. They will call you a liar and other mean things and bring the manager over and all sorts of things. But if you keep saying no, you will get the free stuff. It's just sitting through hours of this that's the tough part.   I remember reading about a guy who did this a lot. Just sat through hours of being called names and being sold on time shares but always walked out with free trips."
Themepark,36zjvq,swimmerboy29,2,Sat May 23 13:42:05 2015 UTC,"Tomorrow will be busy so I recommend getting there early, before 9:30 if possible.  If you don't already have them, buy your tickets online in advance to save yourself some time at the gate.  Once you are in the park, you probably want to head to Tempesto first if you are early enough.  The back car is my personal favorite section to ride in but its worth trying the front too if the line is short.  If you get to the park late, try to ride during the lunch hour instead and the wait should be reasonable.  The Food and Wine festival is going on tomorrow too so you might want to check out those menus if you are interested in trying out any of that.  There are usually little guides at the front of the park you can pick up that show where all the food stands are and what they serve."
Themepark,36zjvq,detectivekate,1 point,Sat May 23 14:08:57 2015 UTC,"I agree, Tempesto in the back, but only do it once because it'll rough you up a little."
Themepark,36zjvq,yaminub,2,Sun May 24 00:02:11 2015 UTC,"You should have a great time.  I was in the park last night.  It was the start of Food and Wine Festival so there are extra foods and drinks to try.  Tempesto is the new, popular ride and is fairly low capacity so consider riding it first or close to park closing.  The line was about a 40 minute wait last night around 7 PM (park closed at 9 PM).  Park Fans has tons of great tips for BGW.  Have a blast!"
Themepark,36zjvq,Geo-USA,2,Sat May 23 14:45:19 2015 UTC,"Only ride in the front seat of Alpengeist. The ride is so much smoother, it's almost like a different  ride entirely. Definitely worth the wait. Try riding Loch Ness in both the front and back seats, its really cool to see how different the ride feels depending on your seat. If you can, ride in the very back or Apollos Chariot, but any seat on there is great. If you have time, ride Verbolten multiple times, the indoor portion of the ride changes depending on what color cart you ride in. My personal favorite food in the park is Trappers Smokehouse, you get a lot for your money there. Although, the food and wine festival will be going on tomorrow so make sure to try something neeAnd depending on the crowd tomorrow, it'd probably be worth it for you to drop the 55 dollars on a day long quick pass."
Themepark,36zjvq,Thanatos_96,1 point,Sat May 23 14:45:44 2015 UTC,"I'm almost certain the indoor section effects are chosen at random, or at least, are on a pattern unrelated to the color of the car.   I've spent nights going through multiple times and being on the same train with different effects.   Lightning is my favorite."

Themepark,36l9gv,BlueVerse,5,Wed May 20 23:47:53 2015 UTC,"It doesn't move now, and hasn't for years. His nickname is 'disco yeti' because the ""b"" show mode without movement features extensive use of a strobe light, which since you're only in the scene for a few seconds does enough to convey the possibility that the figure may be moving.   As to why it broke and what it would take to get it moving again, it's to the point that every friend of a friend knows someone in Imagineering or maintenance that has a different story, and the truth is probably somewhere in between all of them. Obviously any fix comes down to money and (down)time, and Disney hasn't seen fit to commit either."
Themepark,36l9gv,ThingkingWithPortals,3,Thu May 21 02:34:49 2015 UTC,They stopped trying to fix it because to permanently fix it they'd have to change it's skeleton. Result of bad interaction between different parts of engineering.
Themepark,36l9gv,sparkinspace,3,Thu May 21 02:24:22 2015 UTC,Maybe the giant gorilla roaring down the street next summer will give them some inspiration to fix one of their most impressive AA's.

Also, it concerns me that they are committed to ""screen rides"". I went here recently ands its sort of annoying that everything needed 3-D glasses. Even the tour.   I hope they begin to build actual rides soon which I hope is part of the Harry Potter area.  I love universal, I just hope they start being more creative then ""let's put this ride on a screen and make it 3-D."""
Themepark,36ilt5,elmatador12,1 point,Wed May 20 02:54:46 2015 UTC,"With the space constraints that these parks have to deal with, its sometimes way easier and more practical to just do simulator rides.  And as long as the general public likes it, then they will keep doing it.  Us fans just buy a pass and don't spend as much in the park.  We are gonna go regardless of what is installed.  The general public, on the other hand, will go because of a ride.  And if it has an additional feature, then ita that much cooler to them."

Themepark,364l5z,peanutismint,1 point,Sat May 16 13:05:14 2015 UTC,I think it has to do with a number of things. It now matches the the theme and paint color of the hotel. It makes more sense to them to have the whole area be a mountain wilderness I suppose.

If they can come up with a unique story for each version at each Cedar Fair park, I'm on board.  I just hope, and half expect, that they don't make a generic version and install those at the smaller parks, and put original versions at the major parks."
Themepark,35u1ls,L0KoL,2,Wed May 13 14:41:16 2015 UTC,"The queues are always reasonable at Europa Park from my experience so regardless of what day you go, you'll get on everything you want including re-rides. And if the park is busy, then at 2pm they'll announce what time they'll be extending closing time to.  I recommend asking Europa Street for more advice if that helps.   p.s. Don't miss the 4D Cinema show in France, Das Zeitkarussell."
Themepark,35u1ls,QuercusXIV,2,Wed May 13 18:06:42 2015 UTC,"2 years ago I was there on the tuesday and wednesday (for the record, this celebration day you are talking about is always on a thursday, every year). The tuesday was fine, the park was empty. The wednesday however was a total shocker. It seemed like that was an unofficial celebration day the Germans have and the park was intensely crowded and the queues were very long.  How it looks on the actual celebration day (the thursday), I don't know, but you should expect the worst.  Maybe there are also Germans that have the friday off as well (it's usually a bridge-day into the weekend), so it's a choice between risking more people on the thursday, or risking bad weather and still some chance on having long queues on the friday.  Once again, these are my own personal experiences from 2 years ago. I would personally choose to pick the friday. But it's your choice of course!"

Themepark,35qtn0,DadsinGrads,2,Tue May 12 20:00:33 2015 UTC,"I'm not convinced that this was the plan all along. The skeptical part of me wants to say this was supposed to be an outside company running the bar, but probably didn't want to be wedged between Paradiso 37 and the Boathouse. Raglan Road (they're also building some kind of quick-service location in the empty spot next to the patio, if the rumors hold true). That's a lot of competition for a bar with a small plates menu (as opposed to full-blown restaraunts with bars attached).  Giving it this kind of theme is more than acceptable, and I'll be looking forward to it. But just like the pedestrian bridges over Buena Vista Drive, it seems like this didn't stick to the original plan."
Themepark,35qtn0,tideblue,1 point,Tue May 12 22:16:56 2015 UTC,well they already had a better version of Trader Sams in the form of the Adventurers Club.   I don't understand why they didn't just convert that into a Dinner Show restaurant.

Themepark,35oinu,Wh3resTh3Beef,3,Tue May 12 12:53:08 2015 UTC,"I'm sure their thought process wasn't ""Ha! Let's take out this coaster and replace it with a carnival ride!""  It's probably two separate events. They made the decision to take out Rolling Thunder based on low popularity and it's deterioration. (Which, admittedly, could have been postponed with better care through its lifetime.) Now, they have all this open space to expand into. You're really looking at it wrong if you think this is supposed to replace Rolling Thunder. You're looking at everything wrong if you think any ride that any park removes must be replaced by something of greater value that covers the previous attraction's footprint. Parks mold around the space they have, paths change, sections change.  On top of this, Great Adventure must follow SF corporate's rules. They decide how much each park should spend, and what each park gets."
Themepark,35oinu,1upgamer,1 point,Tue May 12 15:31:55 2015 UTC,"It's really sad because this is my home park.  I worked there for two years in 1999-2000.  I remember the opening of the Golden Kingdom.  I said, this is it.  We are getting real theming, things are going to be better for now on.  But its been getting worse and worse as the years go on.     We lost a whole section of the park (Old Country) and for what?  Cabanas?  The Batman Stunt Arena has been rotting for how many years now?  Movietown is kept alive by Batman the ride.  It's a whole mismash of rides that are barely better then a boardwalk pier.  (Ok that might be a bit harsh El Toro is still great)  Has anyone been on the dark knight recently?  Last year it was a Batman ride in name only.  None of the effects worked.     But thats just Six Flags way now I guess.  They got out of the whole theme park idea years ago."

Themepark,35h653,scottwalker88,2,Sun May 10 16:36:24 2015 UTC,It's worth doing. There are a few things with subtitles but not that many. You get the gist of what's going on though. Some cast speak some English but they are all really friendly even if there's a struggle. It didn't detract from my enjoyment - if anything seeing how a different cultures handles everything is quite interesting.
Themepark,35h653,asantos,1 point,Sun May 10 17:44:13 2015 UTC,That's pretty much what I thought it would be like. It would be ignorant to expect the park to be in English but I think Disney has the power to express what's going on without the need to understand the dialogue.

Shuttles im not sure, I'm sure it varies from place to place. I would strongly consider staying onsite.

For how many hotels there are I don't recall see any shuttles in the parking lot over the past few years so I'm guessing its probably not as common as you would think it should be.  Like /u/CustomMadeGJ said, for the $15 per day parking and the extra hour you get in the park it may be worth staying on the point. Then again, if you have 2 days in the middle of the week you should have plenty of time to do everything so the extra hour isn't crucial."

You also have a playground, a kiddie coaster, an interactive museum space (Discovery Center), and a few photo ops.  I'm not really sure what more they could do where the story (either a theme park about dinosaurs, or the event of the dinosaurs escaping) wouldn't be repeating themselves. Anything new with Jurassic Park could be seen as ""more of the same."" Now, if the movie is a hit, that would change, but it would have to be distinct.  Plus, you have to think about this from a marketing perspective: the park has a JP section already, so how would you market a new ride while making it stand out? It's much easier to diversify and go with Kong, especially with a new movie around the corner. You also have strong ties to the resort's history with Kong (a day-one attraction that also has a presence in Hollywood), and the perfect Jungle setting for it to go in. It was also previously unused space, so nothing is getting removed for it."

As far as a new JP ride and story goes, a coaster does not necessarily need a strong story backing it. Look at Hulk, and Dueling dragons.   My fantasies about a new ride in JP would first go to: 1. A wooden coaster or 2. An indoor coaster(jeep adventure) with a great theme, much like the mummy."
Themepark,352d3y,SubClavianGroove,3,Wed May 6 21:49:23 2015 UTC,"IOA has one ride with 3D: Amazing Adventures of Spider-Man. It also has one other simulator: HP and the Forbidden Journey.  The park already has a lot of higher-thrill rides (Hulk, Dragons, Doom, Ripsaw, River Adventure, Forbidden Journey), so something with less of a height requirement would be good to balance out things. Not suggesting ""no more thrill rides,"" but USF should get the next one.  A wooden coaster would be subject to the same noise ordinance that Hulk is subject to (no operations after midnight). That's okay, but I think the space is too small to do something truly outstanding with that (as in, record-breaking). Maybe in the space behind Men in Black?  An indoor jeep ride/coaster would be too similar to Mummy/Gringotts/Animal Kingdom's Dinosaur, and the plot would be too similar to River Adventure. The whole water ride idea started during production of the movie as a way to keep it unique."
Themepark,352d3y,tideblue,23,Wed May 6 22:01:46 2015 UTC,Is anyone else getting tired of 3D rides?
Themepark,352d3y,Wong-A-Donger,18,Wed May 6 15:46:22 2015 UTC,"It's going to be a combination of 3D with live sets as well as animatronics from what I hear. It incudes an outdoor section as well. Some people are saying a life size Kong animatronic will be featured at one point, which would definitely be a cool throwback to the old attraction.    I don't love 3-D but I can tolerate it so long as it isn't the sole media for the attraction."

Themepark,352d3y,Wong-A-Donger,3,Wed May 6 19:04:32 2015 UTC,"I can't remember, is FJ even 3D? I don't think it is. In any case, FJ is my favorite ride. I was absolutely blown away by it the first time I rode it. I think I expected the same to happen with Gringotts. If they had just made a LITTLE more of coaster I would have been so happy. Even if it wasn't that fast, but had a part that spiraled down into the earth with screens around you making it feel like you are going further down than you are."
Themepark,352d3y,tdt0005,6,Wed May 6 19:16:37 2015 UTC,"Not really 3D per say I guess because you don't wear glasses, but very 4D like with the movement and simulated screens. I might be partial though because I'm more of a old school roller coaster / animatronics fan more then anything."
Themepark,352d3y,Wong-A-Donger,2,Wed May 6 19:36:26 2015 UTC,Really?  I thought transformers was one of the best rides I had ever been on. Spider-Man was widely regarded as the number 1 ride in the country for a while.

Themepark,352d3y,MissyTX,5,Wed May 6 16:45:53 2015 UTC,That was underwhelming. Is this going to just be a glorified version of Kong 360 3D?  I still don't get why they're putting a Kong ride in Islands of Adventure when Jurassic World is out soon and King Kong has already been done in the park before.
Themepark,352d3y,scottwalker88,7,Wed May 6 16:03:44 2015 UTC,"Kong hasn't been at IoA, but was at the sister park (Studios) before being replaced by Mummy.

Themepark,352d3y,Dr_ChimRichalds,5,Wed May 6 16:28:07 2015 UTC,"Originally the park was supposed to all be cartoons, but a couple of their deals fell through so they re-worked the plans. Plus they decided they could have more land for a (then promised to Spielberg) Jurassic Park ride at the new park rather than building it at Universal Studios Florida. The everything based on books things is really just a coincidence, and never was part of the ""story"" of Islands of Adventure. The story is that each island is filled with adventures, and Skull Island is both an island that has an adventure on it, so works for me.  I think they were looking to put this in the San Francisco area of USF but decided they would get more room at IOA, plus with Diagon Alley just opened it seemed a better idea to put a new major attraction at the neighboring park. Hogsmeade has far too much traffic in IOA and they desperately need something to eat people on the other side of that park to even it out. This should do just that."
Themepark,352d3y,TheFigment,0,Wed May 6 22:02:50 2015 UTC,"I was sure as shit told the theme of IoA was books when I was trained. It all seemed like a stretch to me, but there's just no damn excuse for this.  WHAT'S THE THEME."

Themepark,3539sb,tideblue,1 point,Wed May 6 19:14:39 2015 UTC,"Poor, neglected Michigan's Adventure. I wish they would get a few small expansions.

Themepark,34xtsz,DarkSoldat,7,Tue May 5 13:33:09 2015 UTC,"If you're not taking the Hogwarts Express, you're going to be walking out of the Front Gate of Islands of Adventure or the Front Gate (or side gate near Hard Rock Cafe/Blue Man Group/Hollywood Rip Ride Rockit -- Still near the front of the park) of Universal Studios Florida and walking by Hard Rock Cafe, Hard Rock Live, and NBA City to the other park.   There are no other Park-to-Park entry points."
Themepark,34xtsz,astilwell,6,Tue May 5 13:53:02 2015 UTC,"Seconded.    To expand a bit: everything at Universal Orlando (parks, shops, hotels, garages) is connected by one big hub called Citywalk. Citywalk is a large area comprised mainly of restaurants, bars, but they also have some entertainment such as mini-golf and a movie theater.    You have to walk through Citywalk to get to either park, and since you're not taking the train to get from park-to-park, the only option is to return to the front of park #1 and hoof it to park#2. The walk from front gate to front gate is like, 5 minutes tops.    That being said, even if you're not the biggest potter fan, its often faster to just hop on the train (especially during the slow season)."
Themepark,34xtsz,superjew619,1 point,Tue May 5 14:09:04 2015 UTC,"The train also deposits you toward the back of the parks, where the higher-capacity rides usually tend to be, so the crowd levels are a little thinner usually. Your best bet (depending on closing hours) is to start at Islands of Adventure, do everything, take the train, and close out USF (especially if Cinematic Spectacular is going on)."

Themepark,34vhft,AriaTheTransgressor,2,Tue May 5 18:18:27 2015 UTC,"""It will open in late spring,"" is all I can say. While things are going perfectly on schedule, an official opening day will not be released quite yet...but soon."
Themepark,34pyhr,DarkSoldat,13,Sun May 3 14:48:14 2015 UTC,"The early entry from on-site hotels clog up the Potter areas. They will be swamped first-thing in the morning. Save Potter for the evening, do as much of everything else first."
Themepark,34pyhr,tideblue,0,Sun May 3 15:04:03 2015 UTC,So now that you have told me this. I'm pondering. I've also been told just to get to the park before it opens and go straight to Harry Potter. Wouldn't it be better to get those rides over with? Then have enough time with the rest of my day and use my fast passes. I feel like if we went to HP in the evening then we would risk waiting in line too long and having to leave when the park closes.   I would much rather spend 2-3 hours getting those 3 HP rides over with then spend the next 7-9 hours exploring the park with my fast passes.
Themepark,34pyhr,tideblue,8,Sun May 3 15:51:43 2015 UTC,"Going straight to Potter would put you behind the guests that got in to those lands an hour early (hotel guests). And you'll be walking past rides at less than 5 minute wait time, to get to the Potter lands in either park."
Themepark,34pyhr,tdt0005,1 point,Sun May 3 16:02:01 2015 UTC,"You might be ok doing Forbidden Journey first, but you will spend the first hour, maybe longer waiting for Gringotts and then another 30 minutes waiting for the HE, then another hour waiting for FJ. Instead, you could be riding the other popular rides with very short waits, and then ride the Potter stuff in the last 2 hours of the day with shorter lines. If you don't mind doing single rider it might be ok to go to Gringotts first."
Themepark,34pyhr,tdt0005,0,Tue May 5 04:57:32 2015 UTC,I'm saying why not do the HP rides first? Sure it'll take a few hours but then I will have the next 8 hours to ride all the other rides with short rides and won't stress about HP.
Themepark,34pyhr,Cizzybone,1 point,Tue May 5 05:00:03 2015 UTC,Do what you want. You will have less time if you do it that way though. I forgot you were buying the fastpasses so it won't be AS big of problem.
Themepark,34pyhr,insomniabob,1 point,Tue May 5 13:33:29 2015 UTC,"The reason for this suggestion is that in the morning, most rides have little to no wait (especially if you are rocking an express pass) and you can manage to experience most if not all the other rides quickly and still have time to go back and try the ones you really enjoyed again later on. It's all for your ability to maximize what time you have there."
Themepark,34pyhr,insomniabob,5,Thu May 7 16:28:32 2015 UTC,"Speaking from personal experience, the lines around the potter stuff are heaviest in the beginning of the day. Everyone has the same thought you do. So, when you walk into the park, and you see a huge crowd going right, go left. You'll get to do some of the other areas with almost no line time, and work your way around the park to HP around early afternoon, when the crowds will have thinned out."
Themepark,34pyhr,CustomMadeGJ,-12,Sun May 3 16:32:59 2015 UTC,But wouldn't it be better to just GET IT OVER WITH? Lol yeah it night take me until 12 or 1 pm to finish those HP rides but then we will be done with them and no longer have to worry about waiting in that long line. Best to get it done first right?
Themepark,34pyhr,trisaratops1,13,Sun May 3 16:51:09 2015 UTC,"What you would be 'getting over with' is one hour+ lines for the most popular rides. If you come back later in the day, often times those wait times are HALVED. Maybe even shorter. In one particular visit, I noted that the wait times were over an hour right as the park opened, and down to 20 minutes around 1pm."
Themepark,34pyhr,CrazyClover92,29,Sun May 3 17:10:06 2015 UTC,"But guys, ISN'T HE RIGHT?! SOMEBODY PLEASE TELL HIM HE'S RIGHT?!?!!"
Themepark,34pyhr,lethargicliz,1 point,Sun May 3 18:08:03 2015 UTC,"It really just depends on how crowded it is when you go. What I recommend is to download the USF app because when you get in the park you can see all the wait times on there. Another option is in both parks there is an electronic sign with the ride wait times. That way you can just see whether the waits for the HP stuff are long or short. I would say if Gringotts is 45 minutes or less, go for it, if not, wait till later! Forbidden Journey 30 minutes or less."
Themepark,34pyhr,rapid66,1 point,Sun May 3 16:43:39 2015 UTC,"You've probably driven on I-4 if your in Daytona, so you will probably want to give yourself more time to get to the park because of rush hour traffic. As far as the HP rides, everyone will head for those popular rides first thing, thinking the same thing you are. From my experience with parks, it's better to start from the back or less popular areas and work your way around. Hope you have fun!"
Themepark,34pyhr,rapid66,-1,Sun May 3 22:32:12 2015 UTC,Yeah is rush hour bad between Daytona and Orlando around 7 and 8 am on a Monday? I would imagine it is.   But I don't really mind spending several hours on those first few rides. If it'll take 3 hours or so then I don't mind getting them out of the way. Everyone on here is telling me not to go to those rides first and acting like if I do I will use up my entire day. I mean it'll just a few hours and then I'll be done and free to ride all the other rides with my fast pass. Am I wrong for thinking that?
Themepark,34pyhr,481516234251,2,Sun May 3 23:44:44 2015 UTC,"Do you feel like it's a job? It's something you ""have to get over with"". The Harry Potter areas are awesome if you are a fan. They are meant to be enjoyed. There is a lot of neat hidden stuff to notice. I don't feel like it's something to just get through as fast as possible.  I went in January and rode the gringotts ride about an hour before closing and only had to wait 20 minutes. I rode the train twice and never waited over 30 minutes. Two years ago I went and it was very busy in the morning. So busy that they limited the amount of people let in that area. Later on that day people could just walk in and out freely. I went the week after Hogsmeade opened and they controlled the amount of people then also. The line was around the whole park. I waited until 4pm and I could just walk in. I can say from experience, and obviously other people are saying the same, but it is better to wait until later in the day. People are thinking the same as you so they go there first, then go through the rest of the park, making the rest of the park busier.  Just so you know, you can download an app that has the queue times. It seemed pretty accurate when I went in January."
Themepark,34pyhr,Mulchpuppy,0,Mon May 4 03:02:17 2015 UTC,Yeah you're right. I'll be there for literally 12 hours so I'll have enough time haha.
Themepark,34pyhr,sapro,1 point,Mon May 4 03:59:35 2015 UTC,"When I went everything was deserted except for the Harry Potter stuff. However, it's still a massive time saver to queue for and ride Gringotts then instead of during main hours."

Themepark,34mupd,d35317,5,Sun May 3 02:23:41 2015 UTC,"Are you calling the Fast Passes on the phone? That's like ordering a Big Mac at Burger King and might put the employees in a bit of a grump. Also what specific Express Pass do you currently have? From their website it looks like the prices for the 18th and 19th seem to be about the same so I don't know if they're maybe trying to upsell you to the Unlimited or a two park pass if you don't have either of those options already, or if you got an advance price and they're diminishing that now. If you call again, I hope this information helps! Good luck."
Themepark,34mupd,Amane_VIII,5,Sun May 3 03:34:22 2015 UTC,"To be brutally honest, if you were to try again -- and call them Express Passes this time instead of FastPasses, a competitor's product -- you may get somewhere.  Also I want to echo another user's suggestion that you may have gotten upsold, since the normal XP prices are about the same for both days.  I hope you enjoy the rest of your vacation regardless. :)"
Themepark,34mupd,tideblue,1 point,Sun May 3 12:59:36 2015 UTC,"Basically what happened is that I ordered the fast passes back in February. Since I wanted to change the dates, I now have to pay the price of then fast passes TODAY not how much they were in February.   Which brings me to my next point. I wanted to order the fast passes months ahead of time to save money cause they'll be cheaper. Yes they'll up the price the closer to the date you are but this is why I ordered months ahead. Just like you would a plane ticket. You buy a plane ticket months before at a lower price. You would never buy a plane ticket the week before.   Well what if you buy it months ahead of time and they change times on you? And then you have to switch dates? Oh you can do that sure. But you now have to pay the current prices. Not the prices I was buying at a few months ago.   I overall understand cause a lot of people could just find ways to exchange and return for cheaper values so at the end of the day I got fucked by the system.   But I'm not going to let an extra 60 bucks ruin my time there. I'll do what I can to have the best vacation but it's sad they can use it as a means of more money from guests like myself."
Themepark,34mupd,kyarnell,2,Sun May 3 13:52:23 2015 UTC,"Express passes are an optional upgrade. ""Non refundable"" and ""Non transferable"" means exactly that. Because the system in place can have a day when the Express passes are ""sold out,"" I don't really see why they should let you switch dates after you bought it.  Just go and make the most out of it. From my experience, 6PM closures mean that the parks will be empty."
Themepark,34mupd,balbuzard09,2,Sun May 3 14:21:13 2015 UTC,"To add on to this, the parks aren't in peak right now. Depending on when you're going, you may not even need Express Passes. Some days the new Harry Potter rides are at a 20 minute wait the whole day with no issues.   If the park is closing at 6, it's usually due to a special event whether it be a company renting the park out for a few hours in the evening or something like Grad Bash most recently. Make the most of the time you're there. Get there early and stay all day. You can do all of the rides with time to spare if it's low attendance. And even in high attendance the highest wait times will only be 45-60 minutes which is nothing compared to some Disney rides that can get up to 90-120."
Themepark,34mupd,legacyofblake,1 point,Sun May 3 15:50:24 2015 UTC,"Its a very high possibility that they are closing early because of an event. The parks normally close earlier than usual when someone has booked part of a park for an event. Also you're coming during a slower season, the Express passes are around $60 right now and will probably be about that for that day."

Themepark,34iq34,dewey454,2,Fri May 1 15:46:39 2015 UTC,"I agree too. USF really was quite disappointing with all those attractions being more or less the same.

Themepark,34iq34,thegreatinsulto,4,Fri May 1 17:51:41 2015 UTC,"I will always love the thrill of a practical ride but a 4-D ride offers a chance to tell a story immerse you in it. So they can be awesome.   The sad thing is they end up being huge car accidents because they have to spit a story out in ~5 min (transformers is the worst of it. Complete incoherent nonsense with a few cameos) and there's no care for that aspect.   The exception is The Amazing Adventures of Spiderman. Perfect adaptation and so new and innovative (innovative should always be followed with ""for the time"") yeah the story sucks but it gives you room to breath and soak in the environment before whipping you around."
Themepark,34iq34,scottwalker88,3,Fri May 1 17:59:33 2015 UTC,"That's my biggest issue with Transformers, I've been on it several times and it still doesn't really make any sense.

Is there any real appeal to the torture theme parks near there?
Themepark,34iq34,peanutismint,3,Fri May 1 20:57:20 2015 UTC,"You're definitely not the only one.   Personally, I can take or leave 4D rides. I much prefer really big rollercoasters or brilliantly themed rides that really transport you somewhere (Jurassic Park/Mummy rides at Universal, Tower Of Terror/Radiator Springs at DCA), or in an ideal world, a mixture of the two. I'm not going to say 'no' to a Transformers 4D ride, but if it's either a fully-fledged rollercoaster or a real-life Transformers experience/stunt show etc, I'd much rather have the real 'tangible' stuff.  What worries me is that we're going to see these kind of experiences (Transformers, Spiderman, Harry Potter, Simpsons rides etc) becoming the 'norm' because they're so much cheaper/easier (logistically) to create (I would imagine) than a standard rollercoaster (once you factor in the upkeep, and the overall thoroughfare of rides like these with multiple cars as opposed to rollercoasters with more limited riders-per-minute).  I did a couple of big American parks last summer and at the end of them I did feel like I'd spent a lot of time just sitting watching a 'show'. The Bugs Life thing and the Muppets theatre at DCA, and the Simpsons/Transformers/Shrek/Despicable Me stuff at Universal; these are some E-Ticket attractions but they're all essentially the same - you put on your 3D glasses and then you watch a pre-recorded show. Sometimes your seat moves. Sometimes you get sprayed with stuff. Even the Monsters Inc rolling ride at DCA was more fun because you were seeing real animatronic characters that you knew and loved, albeit a LOT less realistic than, say, CGI animated Minions on a big screen...."

Themepark,34iq34,MrBrightside711,3,Fri May 1 20:52:31 2015 UTC,Star Tours and Transformers are some of the greatest rides I've been on. Only problem is the re-rideablility... Much lower than normal rides
Themepark,34iq34,doctordollaz,3,Mon May 4 16:41:54 2015 UTC,"I think theme parks are trying to push the 4-D rides because they can take up less space and money than tall and large scale roller coasters.   It's not that I don't like 4-D rides, it's just that I prefer riding tall roller coasters."
Themepark,34iq34,InfectedWithRage,2,Wed May 6 01:27:29 2015 UTC,"Not at all. But I see it as 3-D, but with an extra level of immersion. Perfect.   And they have their place. A nice change of pace for a ride, getting you out of the sun for a bit, etc."

Themepark,34iq34,skinkforguv,2,Fri May 1 21:39:02 2015 UTC,"Busch Gardens in Williamsburg has a pretty decent one, Curse of Dark  Castle.  It works because,,,it is basically a haunted house, so you don't really need a whole lot of explanation.  The effects are nifty.  I ride it at least once when I visit.  There aren't a whole lot of heavily themed rides in the NC/ VA area, so it is a nice change.  Overall though, I would rather ride MIB than Simpsons (although....at the time...showing my age here....BTTF was a mind blower, especially after the small box/tiny screen Star Tours and Body Wars.)  The Hogwarts ride is a good mix of practical and projection, but I have only been on it once."

Even though, the Hight Roller is taller, everything is Vegas is so huge; it doesn't seem that high.  In Orlando, it does seem like you're on top of the world. You can see Disney World in the distance... Universal Orlando... and SeaWorld Orlando (probably the closest) when you're descending. They say you can see KSC, but that's way too far... I couldn't see it."
Themepark,34e2z2,CustomMadeGJ,11,Thu Apr 30 12:03:49 2015 UTC,"This rumor has been making the rounds for a while. Universal has the rights in perpetuity, on a pretty iron clad contract.

Themepark,34e2z2,tideblue,12,Thu Apr 30 15:20:50 2015 UTC,"Marvel (and therefore Disney) makes a cut of admissions, percentage of merch sales, and a licensing fee, same as any rights holder that signs an agreement. But it's in Marvel (and Disney's) best interest to keep it going, since they make money and don't spend it.  People don't realize how much Disney doesn't perceive Universal as a threat. They actually work together on some things, legislation included. Did you know, for example, you can buy Universal tickets at Hollywood Studios front gate?  They're not the enemies people make them out to be (also considering the parent Comcast controls a lot of cable subscriptions). Disney and Universal are experiencing years of profitability and success with things the way they are, and there are other priorities in Florida resorts right now, such as expanding per cap spending and keeping on-site hotels full."

Themepark,34e2z2,tideblue,1 point,Thu Apr 30 17:48:00 2015 UTC,Friend of mine is a concierge at the resorts. That's where that ticket info comes from.

For the record I'm curious about this one too, I've never heard of such a thing.  I can see in concept that they would offer them as a customer service measure to someone that was confused and went to the wrong 'studio' park, but there's still the matter of how they actually get to Universal to use their ticket from HS's front gate.   Also, if true wouldn't it make sense that Uni would offer DHS tickets reciprocally..?? That's an even stranger concept to fathom.  Not doubting your info, but doing a quick search I can't find any confirmation about it in the slightest online. I would think it more likely that Universal tickets could be acquired through the concierge at a Disney resort, if arms were twisted, but even that's something I've never heard of."
Themepark,34e2z2,tideblue,1 point,Fri May 1 03:34:12 2015 UTC,"I've never tried it, never had the need. I imagine the transportation there would be via the taxi stand. I don't think they advertise it publicly. That's where they send hotel guests when they ask for tickets. That's all I know."
Themepark,34e2z2,Dr_ChimRichalds,1 point,Fri May 1 04:09:20 2015 UTC,"I was previously employed by both Disney and Universal. In training, Disney made 0 reference to any other park. Universal talked about Disney to an embarrassing point.  Disney recognizes the threat of Universal as a competitor, but it's Universal that has struggled to actually compete with Disney. In the end, you can spend two, perhaps three days at Universal, and a week a Disney. With Harry Potter (for a big example), Disney isn't necessarily happy about losing guests to Universal on a daily basis, but they're begrudgingly accepting that more guests come to central Florida when another park is so close, and guests spending more than a couple days in the area will come to Disney.  Universal has been pulling out all the stops, which is ultimately to the guest's advantage. I'm excited to watch Disney respond to the threat, but I must admit that I'm nonplussed by their upcoming attractions.  For the record, I far preferred working with Disney (despite many, many unmagical days), and I will always prefer being a guest at Disney. Just want to throw out my personal bias."
Themepark,34e2z2,tideblue,2,Thu May 7 04:21:24 2015 UTC,"I think you're right. Universal is happy to have guests for a few days of an Orlando vacation, whereas Disney wants to be your only stop for a week. My Magic Plus and Magical Express are examples of that.  As competitors, they should be throwing millions of dollars around to compete with each other on attractions, yet... Universal is the one adding meaningful additions at a quick pace. Disney, by comparison, looks like the slow one stuck in it's old ways of thinking.  New Fantasyland is nice, but not a game-changer like they wanted it to be. Frozen seems like a smart move actually, but hardcore fans hate it already and are sick of Frozen by now. Avatar is coming, and I'm sure they'll do a good job, but the film won on technology more than story, so I don't know how it will resonate with guests or how they'll market it. The expanded attractions (Soarin' and Toy Story Mania) means more capacity, which is good, but is still more of the same. Meanwhile, Universal's additions generate marketing buzz and speak for themselves, and are getting their money's worth with revenue increases."
Themepark,34e2z2,Dr_ChimRichalds,1 point,Thu May 7 11:39:44 2015 UTC,"Disney just seems to be slower going. Get things right, then realize plans. That's opposed to the disaster that was the Wizarding World of Harry Potter when it opened.  Hollywood Studios is ready for a major overhaul. Once Cars and Star Wars arrive, we'll see a much more overt competition. Even still, Universal will always be more willing to take big gambles. As long as visitors keep coming to Central Florida, Disney will only suffer marginal losses."
Themepark,34e2z2,askewedview,1 point,Thu May 7 13:00:04 2015 UTC,"Can Universal make upgrades and add new rides to the area?

Themepark,34e2z2,tideblue,1 point,Thu Apr 30 16:39:05 2015 UTC,"Not much room for new rides. That Island is already pretty-well balanced, anyway. There are other expansion opportunities in the park that would lead to keeping things diverse.  Upgrades are possible, and have happened since Disney bought Marvel.

The Hulk coaster would still be there as a coaster - like with the Dueling Dragons at WWoHP.  If Disney finally got the ability to imagineer Marvel properties it would blow Universals waste of the property out of the water.  At this point the only thing that doesn't feel like a Six Flags ride with a Super Hero theme slapped on is the Spider-Man ride which is a) a bit dated, and b) essentially just like nearly all the other rides at Universal...a motion simulator.  I love Wizarding World of Harry Potter, so if Universal took that same care and imagination with their Marvel properties (and everything else, to be honest), I would be in the same boat as you - but going to Disney would really be the best thing for it.  Would they be super extreme rides and attractions? No, but I don't think you can't deny they wouldn't be immersive and thought out.  edit: I feel I should also say that I really do love Universal, but I'd just like to see the property where it belongs."
Themepark,34e2z2,Goliath_TL,3,Thu Apr 30 13:59:41 2015 UTC,"The theming from Marvel at IOA was made in the 1990's when the park opened. Yes, it requires updates now, but Universal is not allowed to add any new content due to their current contract.   Universal has the license for anything east of the Mississippi in the US as far as Marvel rides or merchandise. Disney World can't build anything new and neither can Universal. Universal won't let that contract go without a sizeable payout and Disney won't let them update either. Disney will have to pay to get the property back."
Themepark,34e2z2,tdt0005,5,Thu Apr 30 16:21:59 2015 UTC,"Just personal preference I suppose. I think you're under selling Spider-Man and Hulk's theming and  immersion, but again personal preference. I do enjoy a certain level of thrill, maybe that's where it comes from, which is why I choose Universal and Busch Gardens over Disney for my trip. I have no doubt they'd be amazing, immersive experiences, but I don't think it would fit my tastes so I'd likely never experience it."
Themepark,34e2z2,Goliath_TL,2,Thu Apr 30 15:19:28 2015 UTC,"I don't think Disney can compete with Universal anymore.

Themepark,34e2z2,magic_fergie,2,Thu Apr 30 17:45:00 2015 UTC,"Haunted Mansion does exist still. I meant that the new Little Mermaid ride here at Disneyworld was basically a re-skinned Haunted Mansion. Same technology, same layout, just different colors.

NFL is beautiful and incredibly themed. It's just not as immersive as HP because it's not based on an ""real"" fictional place people have seen and are as familiar with.

That's actually more of a point FOR Marvel Island and Spider-man.  My only criticism of it was low, and it was more in relation to the lack of imagination for the other rides they've been building - so I stand by what I said.  Spider-man was the first big one of its kind that Universal had, but Transformers, Hogwarts, Despicable Me, Shrek, and Gringotts, while all are pretty to look at and fun to ride, are essentially just the same type of rides."
Themepark,34e2z2,TVPaulD,2,Thu Apr 30 19:40:59 2015 UTC,"I would agree that the super hero island could use a face lift for sure. It appears that lately Universal has been working on plusing it's themed lands, so hopefully they have an extensive plan for that. And I would also agree that Shrek and Despicable Me are nothing to write home about. But the Harry Potter attractions, while using some of the same techniques to tell a story, are not the same thing, Just because screens are involved.    I give all the props to Disney for an over all experience, but Universal has at the very least, the most technologically advanced rides in the industry as of late. Gringotts and the ""hogwarts"" rides are definitely not the same thing."
Themepark,34e2z2,Deadpoolbub,2,Thu Apr 30 22:17:48 2015 UTC,"If I were Universal I would consider the broader threat they face...  Disney want to use the Marvel characters in their parks. They're going to use them in Asia, California and France. They want to use them in Florida too. If Universal blocks them from doing so in perpetuity, even allowing for their legal right to do so, Disney realistically has only one option to make up for the Marvel shaped hole in Florida:  Star Wars. Lots and lots of Star Wars. The Star Wars franchise is already squaring up for a duel with the Harry Potter franchise. If Disney builds a Total Immersion Experience for Star Wars in Hollywood Adventure (Studios), it competes with Harry Potter on direct terms. But what if Disney decides they need a whole Star Wars park to make up for no Marvel Universe?  Now you have the Harry Potter TIEs squaring off against the comparable Avatar TIE (A fight Universal's Harry Potter licensed lands can win) and a sprawling monument to the biggest entertainment franchise in the world. The Wizarding World experiences will overnight go from being awe-inspiringly impressive to cramped and underwhelming.  It won't be a disaster for them, but it'll hurt. If they can protect themselves by giving up - realistically - one ride that actually matters (Let's be honest, the only part of Marvel Super Hero Island which couldn't be re-themed without massively losing out is Spider-Man) then surely it's worth it to protect the massive value of the Harry Potter investments."
Themepark,34e2z2,TVPaulD,2,Fri May 1 12:26:30 2015 UTC,"I don't know that I buy this. Star Wars is a huge property, I'm sure it will not take spite for then to utilize it to the best of their ability."

Themepark,34dpxk,1upgamer,2,Fri May 1 14:19:11 2015 UTC,They pretty much just redid the back to the future ride honestly.  Its the same thing.  Florida does have a Kang and Kodos spinner though.
Themepark,34dpxk,backfire103,3,Fri May 1 14:34:08 2015 UTC,"I visited Universal Studios Hollywood in January, and found that a large section of the park was sectioned off for the Simpsons and Harry Potter area development.

Themepark,3454o5,FireFingers1992,2,Tue Apr 28 11:23:52 2015 UTC,"Holy crap— this looks terrible! Those concept art images make it look like a nightmarish, super-concentrated version of medieval England. What was the design brief, ""Olde-England on Acid""?  It's like they've taken all of English history and culture, and reduced it to this fake, garish monstrosity. I bet you'll be able to buy Authentic British Fish & Fries™, and ride around in miniature double-decker buses and black cabs shouting ""ELLO GUVNAH!"".  Seriously. Look at that last concept image. It's just any street in London, with union flags hanging from the walls. Why not just go to London? Why are they building this in Britain? It's the same mistake Disney made building that Ratatouille-themed zone in Eurodisney, ""Let's build an entire zone that's a recreation of the streets of Paris!"" what's the point when actual Paris is a short bus trip away? Do something better with the money. Do something more imaginative.   It's like some wealthy American businessman's masturbatory, fetishised ideal version of England. With towering Tudor townhouses, and fairytale castles. That stuffs great, but not when you can just go to York and see The Shambles, or any National Trust or English Heritage castle. Take a train, England's only small. Give us something different, we still have the real thing.   This is not being built with the British people in mind. This is for rich foreign tourists to come and pretend they're in magical Harry Potter Britland for the day. Really disappointed at this.  EDIT: Oh good God."
Themepark,3454o5,SickTriceratops,1 point,Wed Apr 29 10:05:48 2015 UTC,"The one thing that does puzzle me is the castle, because they are in great abundance in the South East, and probably the least original thing you could put in a theme park. But given the name ""Myth and Legends Castle"", I'd expect we could we see dragons, King Arthur and all that mythological side, as opposed to English Heritage's truth, which could be fun.   As for a medieval theming for the port, personally I think it makes perfect sense. Gives a lot of scope for attractions and dining, especially as it is quite clearly got fantasy influences (the airship piloted by a wizard).  And given this is the art work for just 4 of the 7 proposed lands (Cartoon Circus, Starfleet Command, Action Square still absent) there is plenty of scope for variety especially as the only artwork for Entertainment City is the final image, with other than the odd Union Jacks looks great, with a roof so it is British weather proof.   But at the end of the day it is all concept art anyway, so the likelihood of it looking anything like this come 2020 is pretty low.  The thing that gets me excited about this project is Merlin having some competition in the UK. Their parks have becoming increasingly run down as the have cornered the market on large scale theme parks, and so having someone else to choose will hopefully force them into sorting themselves out."
Themepark,344kgr,DarkSoldat,3,Tue Apr 28 06:30:09 2015 UTC,"I will never forget one of the first times I visited Universal Studios circa 2002ish. We were standing in the concourse area near the Hulk, maybe closer to Spiderman. And we see something fly off of the hulk and smash to pieces on the concourse not 20 feet from us. It was a cell phone. A 2002 sized cell phone...  I hate their rule and was definitely irked by the fact that I couldn't have my phone with me in line. I always make sure I have something with a zipper to secure my phone, or something that keeps it very secure. But I understand why they had to implement this. Too many idiots out there."
Themepark,344kgr,tdt0005,2,Wed Apr 29 02:19:08 2015 UTC,"Completely agree, I usually wear a fanny pack (how cool!) when I go to the theme parks and that was considered secure enough to bring my phone and wallet onto the ride. But yeah I can understand their reasons because of the idiots who insist on having their phones out WHILE ON THE RIDE."
Themepark,344kgr,Gator_Engr,1 point,Wed Apr 29 23:24:35 2015 UTC,"Are you saying Universal let you wear your fanny pack with your phone in it recently? Or just theme parks in general? I'm not a fan of the fanny pack, but I would consider wearing one at Universal if so."
Themepark,344kgr,tdt0005,1 point,Thu Apr 30 02:41:12 2015 UTC,"They used to, not sure how it is now. Last time I went to Universal, which was March 14, I could wear the fanny pack on the Hulk and Duel... sorry I mean Dragon Challenge. Rip Ride Rockit however was very strict and did not allow anything onto the ride."
Themepark,344kgr,Gator_Engr,1 point,Thu Apr 30 02:47:17 2015 UTC,"Thanks, that answers my question. I was there in December. I had to use the lockers for Hulk and RRR."
Themepark,344kgr,tdt0005,3,Thu Apr 30 02:52:04 2015 UTC,"Use the free lockers. They're trying to do you a favor, instead of potentially losing your items. It's just like how Cedar Point requires you to wear a strap on your glasses when some coasters. It's for safety, just do it."
Themepark,344kgr,tideblue,4,Wed Apr 29 03:51:25 2015 UTC,"Yes, this is true to some extent. When entering on these rides, employees standing near the entrance ask you to put all belongings into a locker. But its not like you get a ""pat down"" before getting in line. The lockers are also free for a certain amount of time to make sure that you can ride the attraction without paying for the locker time. When I was there over the winter, I placed everything in a locker except my wallet so I am sure you can do the same.    This all started a few years ago when some kids started throwing pocket change at other riders on Dueling Dragons. It started again recently so the began enforcing this policy."
Themepark,344kgr,Erkel1273,5,Tue Apr 28 06:38:22 2015 UTC,They have taken it a step further. They now have metal detectors and they seem permanent now.
Themepark,344kgr,scottwalker88,1 point,Tue Apr 28 07:33:57 2015 UTC,"The last I heard, they only had metal detectors on RRR. Do you know if they added them to other rides?"

Themepark,344kgr,scottwalker88,1 point,Thu Apr 30 09:20:00 2015 UTC,My main concern is leaving my valuables in a locker and getting it stolen. And I usually have shorts with big cargo pockets on the sides. I always button up my wallet and cell phone in those pockets. Will they even notice or check? Maybe not
Themepark,344kgr,Megosaurusrex,4,Tue Apr 28 06:48:46 2015 UTC,"Even if the pocket is zipped, buttoned and velcroed down, if there is a visible bulge in the pocket you will be sent back to the lockers and forced to re enter the queue. Metal detector will catch your phone.   Just because you promise it's your wallet in your pocket and you promise you won't pull it out on the ride doesn't mean you get to bring it with you. Sorry. The metal detectors were put in place because people refuse to follow directions.   Don't bring a ton of valuables. An ID, one credit card and a low denomination of cash. If the locker is opened without your authorization there is a security camera. Smart cart, the company that owns the lockers and staffs the locker attendant would be held responsible for stolen items."
Themepark,344kgr,scottwalker88,1 point,Tue Apr 28 18:35:15 2015 UTC,Being forced to re enter the queue is just harsh especially if it's busy.
Themepark,344kgr,Megosaurusrex,3,Tue Apr 28 18:41:10 2015 UTC,"I don't disagree but that's the policy. When I was there a week ago I passed 4 employees telling me to put stuff in a locker before I entered the queue. Then another 6 plus a security guard inspecting at metal detector location. Plus two more loading the queue, then two more loading the train and securing the restraints. If you ignore fourteen employees, you deserve to wait again. I have ten years of Orlando theme park experience, and unfortunately push comes to shove because people don't. Follow. Damn. Directions.   Rockit and hulk both travel over guest areas. It's not to protect your precious phone. It's to protect the heads of people walking under rather the ride."

But as long as each one of those rides has locks on those lockers that only I can open. Then I'll feel a lot better and wouldn't have an issue at all. All I'm bringing is our IDs, our fast passes, my car keys, my wallet, a credit card, a small amount of cash and just one of our cell phones. Basically the bare minimum of what you would need when you go to a theme park."
Themepark,344kgr,CustomMadeGJ,1 point,Tue Apr 28 21:47:23 2015 UTC,Yeah they are lockers that use your fingerprint to unlock.  I frequent the park about once a week and have never had any issues with lockers there.

Themepark,341knp,tideblue,2,Tue Apr 28 01:58:25 2015 UTC,"Hard Rock had a lot of things going their way, but it was more then a lack of market and they screwed up a few critical things (pricing and marketing, for starters) that may have helped. I think it could have made it in that location with the right approach and long term investment.   There's an excellent series of articles about its history starting here."
Themepark,341knp,BlueVerse,2,Tue Apr 28 13:32:19 2015 UTC,"I agree. From everything I've seen and read, they just assumed that people would magically know about it and come. Even the Disney parks do a huge amount of marketing, so when you have a lot of the tourists at Myrtle Beach not even knowing that the park exists, therein lies the problem."
Themepark,341knp,BlueVerse,2,Wed Apr 29 00:15:45 2015 UTC,"I'm in Central Florida, well within the 'one day drive' area they should have been marketing to.   I knew about it because I stay up on coaster and theme park news, but there was nothing here about the park, except a few local news stories and then only because Hard Rock corporate is located here. I don't ever remember any commercials, billboards, newspaper ads... Nothing. If you weren't plugged into the industry, theres no way a Floridian would have known about it, especially since it's not like we go to Myrtle to go to the beach.  I talked recently with a SC local about it, and I think it's fair to say there were shenanigans with the real estate deals done to put the place together, allowing a lack of operating capital to bring the whole thing crashing down well before it was even given a chance.   I mean, who spends 200 million and then only gives it a shot for 4 months....? The business plan should have been funded to weather a few years of losses, giving time to establish the destination."

In June, Universal shall be busy, so unless you want to fork over for an express pass, it may be worth it to do both parks, one day each.  If you are absolutely needing Hogwarts's Express, then get the 2 park 1 day pass.  SeaWorld is doable in one day.  And if you want to swing by Fun Spot and ride White Lightning, it'll cost you $9 and take a whole 15 minutes."
Themepark,342wxj,Woirol,1 point,Mon Apr 27 22:11:57 2015 UTC,"It really depends on how busy June is and how long you're staying. I have only been twice, once in 2005 for nearly 3 weeks, and we're a week in to a three week stint right now.  I have only been in April/May.  If you have plenty of time like us, no don't bother with the park hopper, if it's a quick whirlwind visit and you need to see as much as possible, then perhaps a park hopper is for you.  If you have time spend a day going from resort to resort, finishing up at Riverside for dinner, some of these places are amazing.  Download your ""My Disney Experience"" app to your smartphone, it is so easy to organise your fast passes, meals etc. on it.  And if money isn't an option (I really wish our travel agent told us about this one) buy the magical memories photo thing. All the professional photos that are taken throughout the resort go to the web where you get to keep them... It even takes video of you on selected rides.  Have fun"
Themepark,342wxj,joeynana,1 point,Tue Apr 28 03:40:46 2015 UTC,"This is going to vary immensely based on who you are, but last time I went to Disney, I spent 2 days in Universal, 2.5 days at Epcot, and 1 full day each at the other Disney parks. The Park Hoppers wouldn't have been useful to me at all. Many people feel that Animal Kingdom is a half-day park, but for m, that just doesn't hold true. If you truly experience everything the park has to offer, including shows and animals, you'll easily spend most of the day there.  One thing that really helped us get everything done when we went was taking advantage of Disney's Extra Magical Hours, which got us up to 3 extra hours in each park we visited, so definitely look into that if you want to maximize your time.  I went in October, so you're going to get a very different crowd going in June, meaning it's going to be a lot busier.  No matter how much you get done, you're still going to have a great time and want to go back ASAP."
Themepark,342wxj,GDdashROM,1 point,Tue Apr 28 16:19:34 2015 UTC,For what it's worth I don't think the Hogwart's Express was worth the price of the park hopper tickets at Universal. It was cool but not necessary. I would strongly recommend the fast pass equivalent though.

From here, you can then choose where you'd like to sit, so a front row is an option for every ride.  You will still have to wait in any 'front row' line that exists. Fast Lane does not get you straight to the trains.  Even as a season passholder to Cedar Point, I sometimes buy Fast Lane just because I enjoy getting everything done that I want so quickly!

Hulk and Rip Ride Rocket aren't very tall either. Hulk is pretty fast and fierce though. I have no idea about Sea World's coasters as I haven't been there since maybe 1993?   Edit: Just looked them all up. Rocket is the tallest at 163 feet and Hulk and one of Sea World's are tied for fastest at 65. If Sea World really wants to bring in new crowds with a coaster, they need to do something like Top Thrill Dragster (but obviously not just a clone like King Da Ka) to bring in coaster enthusiasts. No one is going to suddenly go to Sea World instead of Universal or Disney because they have a ""pretty good"" coaster. I am a coaster enthusiest, and I've wanted to go to Sea World and try out Manta and Kraken.

Obviously I'm not saying coasters can't be good unless they are taller or faster than that. I certainly am not going to judge those coasters without riding them first. But I can't think of many coasters I've ridden with those specs that are an actual draw for me to come to an amusement park. They are more like really good rides to do while I'm there after riding 1 or 2 amazing coasters.
Themepark,33po5j,tdt0005,5,Sat Apr 25 02:38:45 2015 UTC,"I'm a huge enthusiast too, but going to SeaWorld is as much about seeing the shows as it is riding the coasters.  Also a mix thing is that after noon, most the guests are watching shows so the coaster lines get significantly shorter."
Themepark,33po5j,Woirol,1 point,Sat Apr 25 02:51:36 2015 UTC,"I really want to check it out one day. But my trips to Orlando are always at most a week, and rarely that long or more often than once a year. And I feel like I need that much just for Disney."
Themepark,33po5j,tdt0005,2,Sat Apr 25 02:59:54 2015 UTC,"You could save a ton of money, and still have a phenomenal time by doing a few days at universal, a day at SeaWorld and a day at Busch gardens.  Disney seems to be going through a huge transition phase right now and those things aren't going to open for a while.  Plus Orlando is way more than just Disney."
Themepark,33po5j,Woirol,0,Sat Apr 25 03:09:45 2015 UTC,"I know, but I just love Disney way more than any of those other parks. (admittedly I haven't been to SW in like 20 years.) But I have no desire to go back to Busch Gardens for a while and never want to spend more than a day or two at Universal. I can do everything there in a day if I have to. I could spend 2 weeks at Disney and not get bored I think. For my non-Disney theme park fix, I find my way to Cedar Point every 1-3 years and I usually get a season pass to Six Flags Over Georgia."
Themepark,33po5j,tdt0005,2,Sat Apr 25 03:17:16 2015 UTC,"I love Disney too, but like to try the other things as well.  What's wrong with Busch Gardens?  They have pretty awful employees but I love the park."

But its not a destination park to work at so its a lot of people just working a job.  But every park does have its shining stars that love the industry and thrive to make their park the best it can be.  And I thank people like you, because without you, I would hate going to parks."
Themepark,33po5j,Woirol,-1,Sat Apr 25 16:14:20 2015 UTC,"I've only been there once. 2009. But just nothing there impressed me. I honestly have almost zero memories from that day. I know I rode all the coasters but I don't remember a single one. My memories from that day include a tour group being led by a giant flag pole, playing some type of new app i had downloaded while we waited in line all day, and a train ride around the park to look at animals. If I lived in the area, and I wish I did, I would definitely go to BG and SW often."
Themepark,33po5j,tdt0005,3,Sat Apr 25 03:31:57 2015 UTC,"The tour groups with the flags are a very normal thing here in Orlando.  But they have added Cheetah Hunt, which is quite fun.  And Kumba and Montu are two of my favorite B&Ms.  Kumba hauls so much ass."
Themepark,33po5j,Woirol,2,Sat Apr 25 03:47:34 2015 UTC,Specs never tell the whole story. Would you really say Kingda Ka is a better ride overall than SFNE's Bizarro?
Themepark,33po5j,thisistheperfectname,0,Mon Apr 27 20:43:55 2015 UTC,"I specifically said I'm not saying coasters can't be good unless they are a certain height and speed.   But comparing those two coasters is completely different. I've never ridden King Da Ka, but if it is anywhere near as good at TTD at Cedar Point then I can see how some people would enjoy it more than Bizarro. (I have no interest to try it vs Dragster simply because of the shoulder restraints personally.) But they are completely different types of rides. I WOULD say Millennium Force is better than Bizarro. And a lot of that has to do with the fact that it is 300 ft vs 200, and goes 90 vs 77."
Themepark,33n5sp,Time93,8,Thu Apr 23 21:48:02 2015 UTC,"I haven't been to Universal Studios Florida in years so forgive me if this is way out of date or irrelevant. But I remember watching the Terminator 2: 3-D show when the T-800's motorcycle was broken. The actor is supposed to ride onto the stage on a special Harley Davidson that follows some tracks in on the ground. He drives around, shoots some guns, John Conner jumps on the bike with them, and they both ride through a ""time portal"" where they appear on a big 3D screen, transformed into Arnold Schwarzenegger and Edward Furlong.  Anyway, when the bike was broken the actors performed everything on foot, but the loud motorcycle sound effects were still played over the speakers. Then of course they ran through the time portal and suddenly were riding a Harley onscreen. It was stupid and confusing if you'd never seen it before when the bike was working. From what I heard, it was broken a lot."
Themepark,33n5sp,insanityfarm,3,Thu Apr 23 23:59:26 2015 UTC,"At Universal Studios in Anaheim the ride broke down, well sort of. Before the terminator shows up there's some corporate rep presenting the ""future of robotics"" and how ""skynet will revolutionize everything"".   Anyways, the Terminator shows up and basically grabs the rep by the throat and throws her at the wall. During our show when he did this something went wrong and he broke her neck or clavicle. Nothing like the automated show continuing, leaving pauses for the actors ques, while medics are running onto the stage to assist this poor woman."

Now... nothing. The car still stops where the fire and helicopter used to happen and iirc the helicopter noise is still made, but... Nothing happens (at least at Canada's Wonderland). It's very disappointing."
Themepark,33n5sp,cadieness,5,Fri Apr 24 00:49:54 2015 UTC,"I heard Canada's Wonderland's version doesn't even stop at the helicopter scene anymore.

Themepark,33n5sp,cadieness,4,Fri Apr 24 01:43:50 2015 UTC,I've worked Kings Island's version and liked how face-paced it was. Definitely made the shift go by a lot quicker.

Themepark,33n5sp,TheFigment,8,Sat May 2 13:17:51 2015 UTC,"Speaking of the Great Movie Ride at Hollywood Studios, as a child I vividly remember that during the ""Alien"" section, an alien drops out of the ceiling over the cars. When I went as an adult, I braced myself for the alien (and warned my sister about it!)—but the alien never dropped down from the ceiling (it's still clearly visible over the cars).  For a broken and then repaired featuer, the train ride at Cedar Point has animatronic skeletons along half of the ride, getting into various Wild West themed tomfoolery. For a number of years, the animatronics didn't fully work—sections with water and fire features didn't run, and sections involving moving characters were either muted or didn't work at all. In the last couple of years (ever since they installed the Dinosaur exhibit), the skeletons have been back to full capacity."
Themepark,33n5sp,TheFigment,11,Fri Apr 24 15:12:21 2015 UTC,"Here's a few...   The Great Movie Ride at Disney's Hollywood Studios - One of the opening scenes, the ""Footlight Parade"", features a pyramid of dancers. It used to spin and shoot water, as seen here. Today it's stationary with no water and the whole scene is behind a large screen, as seen here Expedition Everest at Disney's Animal Kingdom - The climax of the ride is when the train passes below a monstrous Yeti animatronic. It was originally animated, swinging its large hand at riders (kind of seen here, or clearly seen here. Today the Yeti is static with a strobe light creating the illusion of motion. Boo Blasters on Boo Hill at Kings Island - Towards the end of attraction riders used to pass through a fog screen with Boocifer's face projected onto it, similar to the famous waterfall effect on Pirates of the Caribbean. The effect was turned off or stopped working midway through the attraction's opening year, 2010. Ellen's Energy Adventure at Epcot - Ellen DeGeneres is featured on screen in the attraction multiple times, but also formerly used to have her own animatronic, seen here. Both her and the dinosaur she was fighting have been removed. Harry Potter and the Forbiddean Journey at Universal's Islands of Adventure - The attraction's climax features a series of dementors attacking riders. After passing through a fog screen there are several static dementors attached to the ceiling, mostly out of sight and only visible if you carefully look for them. Rumor is they were originally planned to swoop down at the riders in a hoard, but Warner Brothers executives found the experience too horrifying and had it turned off."
Themepark,33n5sp,progress_dad,4,Thu Apr 23 23:27:04 2015 UTC,I've also heard the dementors had bony hands that would be extended out toward you but were deemed too scary for kids.
Themepark,33n5sp,progress_dad,3,Fri Apr 24 13:11:02 2015 UTC,"Ooh, I forgot about that one. The reason I heard for their removal though was that they kept hitting the ride vehicles during test."
Themepark,33n5sp,scottwalker88,6,Fri Apr 24 13:38:39 2015 UTC,"Well, that's even scarier then."
Themepark,33n5sp,RedditOatmeal,4,Fri Apr 24 16:28:38 2015 UTC,"Awesome! Although I know I saw Ellen AA less than a year ago, do you know when it was removed?  Also along the same vein as Forbidden Journey, the first 5 or so times I rode Escape from Gringotts on the 3rd day it was open, the fog effects in the cave scene did not work. I went back a couple days later (of course) and they were and it was seriously SO MUCH BETTER even though I already knew what was coming! But had they always been working, it would've been 1000 times scarier and I would not have known how they did it!"
Themepark,33n5sp,progress_dad,3,Fri Apr 24 16:16:36 2015 UTC,"Definitely agree about Gringotts. I went over the summer and enjoyed the attraction, but it wasn't until last month I returned and the fog just amplified the attraction so much. Unfortunately, the moving door in that final scene appears to have been turned-off - there is now a blatantly obvious hole in the screen during the scene instead.  Regarding Ellen, it appears to have been removed in September - source."

There are copies of those in the actual drop shaft. They're just not always lit up. I was doing a test ride one night after close and we stopped right in front of the little girl. She was lit up so spookily and then I hear ""its raaaaining, its pouuuurrring"" and I legitimately screamed. It makes it 1000 times scarier and they managed to get it working! It works on and off now, to my understanding. And this was in the Foxtrot dropshaft (if you want to go on Foxtrot, when you come to the split that says ""USE BOTH SIDES"" take the right turn instead of going straight and that'll get you to the right one).  Also for those that are unaware, this is a good place to mention the legacy of the Hatbox Ghost at DLR!"

Take your first right, which most people seem to do, or keep going straight and eventually take another right. We also do that because less people see to go to those.

Themepark,33n5sp,vinbel121,2,Sun Apr 26 13:25:12 2015 UTC,what do you mean by all 4 sequences?
Themepark,33n5sp,progress_dad,3,Sun Apr 26 14:27:40 2015 UTC,"over the course of tower's life, it started out with just 1 drop sequence. then it slowly added a few more (remember tower of terror 2: twice the fright?). It currently has 4  if you ask a bellhop what the drop is like, we can't tell you for sure. We'll say it's random but that is only partially true. there are 4 distinct drop sequences (2 go up first, 2 go down first, 2 go all the way to the bottom for what I like to call bonus features. A short film at the bottom (1 is the window breaking and 1 is the 5 victims surging with electricity) from which you go back up for more drop sequence. But there is an element of randomness to it. nobody knows what drip sequence you're going to get until the ride vehicle (AGV: autonomous guided vehicle) clicks into the VVC (vertical vehicle conveyance). The computer generates a random pick out of the 4 at the last second.   any more questions?  haha"
Themepark,33n5sp,vinbel121,2,Sun Apr 26 15:41:11 2015 UTC,"Do they appear at the bottom of the drop shaft where the screen is? Because I remember the first time I rode it, I saw the blue figures again, and then we shot back upwards. Then we went back down to see the usual ending of the ride."

RCDB also lists it as an Intamin launcher.  I also read posts in German forums by people who saw Intamin labels on some of the containers the rails were delivered in. So nothing's confirmed yet, but at this point we can be pretty sure it's going to be Intamin. Another hint: Phantasialand bought a waterride from Intamin for the last year, maybe they have some kind of contract for two rides.

Opened in 1999 as ""Branson USA"", the park has been abandoned since 2008. The park is owned by Herschend Family Entertainment, which also owns the nearby Silver Dollar City and White Water Branson attractions, as well as many other attractions nationwide. While many of the park's rides have been relocated to other parks, there are many attractions which remain onsite. All footage was filmed via DJI Phantom 2 Drone. Hope you enjoy.

All of the buildings remain closed and secured. They don't seem to be trimming the bushes or trees, but even all of the walking paths are in great condition, and not overgrown with weeds and grass."
Themepark,33hlh6,1GoodDad,4,Wed Apr 22 16:13:26 2015 UTC,I would suggest going in the off-season if you want short lines without having to spring for the express pass.  A couple of years ago we took my daughter during her fall break which was late-September-early-October and it was awesome. We were able to do everything in both parks with little to no lines. The longest wait we had was about 15 mins and that was rare. Most rides we were able just to   right up to.
Themepark,33hlh6,akadros,2,Wed Apr 22 17:30:11 2015 UTC,"Agreed. I took my girlfriend last year in late September and the express pass wasn't required.  Also, Cabana Bay is a cheap on-site hotel that I highly recommend."

The two sons boarded first and were whisked out of the station. The parents were about to board when the attendant stopped them, saying they could not bring their bag. After a brief argument, the parents ended up sprinting out of the station and towards the other end of the park so that their kids were not abandoned.  Yeah, it's a pretty backwards rule that's just asking to cause problems."

I'd also say that that makes my evidence more than anecdotal.  Yes, I'm aware that this incident, if it did occur, happened a long, long time ago, but I've been with the company almost a decade, and know people who have been with the company for many more years than I have who have told me that the job has not changed too drastically.  Keep in mind that I did not say that your friend is a liar, nor did I say you are.  I simply have not seen any proof that this incident occurred.  It could have, of course, it's not impossible.

Kinda like the Toy Story Midway ride at Disney. That will probably be the new standard fare for flat rides. I do also think that oculus rift style VR will have a place too, but it will not be as prevalent, but it will be there. I expect that to be sorta like giant rooms in which you go in your movements are tracked the displayed within your VR headset. Kinda like a giant laser tag.  Rollercoaster will get, bigger, longer, taller, faster, more extreme. I doubt technologically anything will happen to the physical rides themselves. Although ""show elements"" will change with technology making the ride experience more intense, but I would assume that the  drop as always will be shown to the rider unencumbered."

Themepark,33c2zp,cheezndquackers,9,Tue Apr 21 14:14:27 2015 UTC,"The not over 200 feet rule Disney has is largely because, in Florida, any structure 200 feet or taller needs to have light beacons atop it so planes can see them.

Background of article  DisneyQuest:       The DisneyQuest project was designed as a way for the Disney brand to reach populations that may not have the chance to travel to its various theme park destinations. It was meant to target large cities and urban areas. Had the project continued, Disney had plans to construct locations in many major cities in the United States, like Philadelphia.   The second DisneyQuest was built and opened in Chicago,  but it was permanently closed on September 4, 2001 due to low attendance as well as other, broader issues.  After the failure of DisneyQuest Chicago, the DisneyQuest project was officially brought to an end. Construction that had begun on a DisneyQuest in Philadelphia, at the former site of Gimbels Department Store, was scrapped, and a DisneyQuest at Disneyland Resort in California never proceeded past the planning stage. Disney announced another location to be built in downtown Toronto (at the Dundas Square inside the new high tech mall Metropolis), but this project was also cancelled.  After the closure of the Chicago location, Disney Regional Entertainment turned over control of the remaining location to Walt Disney World operations.

Themepark,3325vr,KaiserCoaster,3,Sun Apr 19 15:30:33 2015 UTC,"They're saying late spring now.  I was there today and last Sunday - the ride itself looks basically done, but I don't think the queue is there yet."

Themepark,3325vr,bchris24,1 point,Sun Apr 19 07:50:06 2015 UTC,Weren't they advertising it for early spring? I don't remember. I used to work there. I thought it was silly they were going to put it in that division but then again there wasn't really anywhere else it would fit.
Themepark,3325vr,vfrfreak23,1 point,Thu Apr 30 17:20:27 2015 UTC,"Yeah i was surprised when I saw where they are putting it, doesn't seem ideal and will probably crowd that area up more but yeah not much else space. They just need to pull out boomerang and Kong and replace them something anything. I did hear though that since they are retiring the elephants they aren't going to replace them at all so that whole area will be empty. Wonder what they are going to use that area for."
Themepark,3325vr,bchris24,1 point,Thu Apr 30 18:16:53 2015 UTC,"I'd take out Kong. I hated test riding it, all the guests who ride it are only first time riders. Don't get a lot of return riders because it just hurts. Putting a decent ride where the elephants are will definitely make that area more popular. It's always dead when I go there. Kong was almost replaced by a bigger ride like Medusa. But corporate didn't like the idea because it would mean building over the HR building. Shame. Would've been as popular as division 4 where roar and superman are."
Themepark,3325vr,vfrfreak23,1 point,Thu Apr 30 18:26:46 2015 UTC,"Yeah i go one it once a year to get it out of way or if I'm with someone that's never been to the park. I always warn them about the headbanging and when we're done we don't go back. The only reason I think Boomerang should be replaced is that Everytime I go operations on it is so damn slow. It always seems to have the longest line because of that. A coaster doesn't even have to go there, just an awesome flat ride.   Honestly the park is in desperate need of just one more bigger ride. Medusa and Roar are the only unique rides at the park. Every other coaster is a clone, or like V2 was originally a clone. It's the reason I stopped getting season passes, I love Medusa so damn much but I'm not going to pay the money to go there when they're all rides I could do on anywhere else now."
Themepark,3325vr,bchris24,1 point,Thu Apr 30 18:36:51 2015 UTC,"They do it on purpose, to give people a ""reason"" to come back that come early in the season. We will have a clone of this one at Six Flags Over Georgia. I'm not really looking forward to it and it's definitely not a coaster."

I know that Rolling Thunder was past its prime, but it was a ""real"" coaster, and one that many people loved.

Themepark,32sqlp,ProffieThrowaway,2,Thu Apr 16 16:17:32 2015 UTC,"Dinosaurs seem to be an unusual difficult to sell item in theme parks period (just look at Dinoland USA in Disney World, for example). However, as a kid I went to a museum in Vegas a couple times that had animatronic dinosaurs and found it a generally good time. One had its skin off and you could direct it using a joystick and I liked that. I'm not overly impressed with those style of exhibits now, but I'm not part of their audience. I think Dinosaurs Alive is the sort of thing I would have enjoyed as a kid with my grandparents who otherwise paid for tickets but rode nothing. Other things we would do with them at theme parks included the ride in cars and a nice slow ride in the chariot on the carousel."

Second thought: I wonder if they'll focus on the parks without Boo Blaster rides first? If they built one at Michigan's Adventure (since they say ""all parks""), would that give them a push to start a Haunt event? Or will they even make it that far?"

Themepark,32rl7o,deadmemories1,1 point,Thu Apr 16 04:39:17 2015 UTC,Some rides you can take your bag on. Rides that it's mandatory you leave your stuff off usually provide a locker for free for a certain amount of time (either an hour or so...I think it's based on the wait time). Last thing you do is just set your bag somewhere unattended.
Themepark,32rl7o,sil3nt8o8,1 point,Thu Apr 16 04:41:35 2015 UTC,Only takes a few minutes.  It's easier than going to the front of the park.   Plus you should be carrying water jugs as the coke freestyle machines give it free all over the park.
Themepark,32rl7o,sil3nt8o8,1 point,Thu Apr 16 04:42:32 2015 UTC,Hold up. Please explain this water jug thing in full detail to me.

Themepark,32opjy,kobayashimaru13,1 point,Thu Apr 16 04:23:40 2015 UTC,I'm plan on being there before they start letting people into Italy. With Verbolten I got to the park just as they were letting cars park and I managed to get on the 2nd train. So I'm hoping I can get in one ride and then the rest of the coasters will be empty >:3
Themepark,32opjy,Ritz527,2,Thu Apr 16 14:22:00 2015 UTC,Tempesto looks like Superman at SFDK.  The inversion is indeed incredibly slow.  It's great! :)
Themepark,32opjy,soapandlather,1 point,Wed Apr 15 17:07:20 2015 UTC,"It's very similar, if not the exact same track structure. BGW's train has three cars (18 passengers) vs. SFDK's 2 cars (12 passengers) -- I think that may be the only real difference."
Themepark,32opjy,soapandlather,1 point,Wed Apr 15 17:33:46 2015 UTC,"Oh wow that will definitely make the line much better. In the on season, Superman is the kind of ride you run to when the park opens then forget about for the rest of the day."

Themepark,32n9rz,tideblue,1 point,Wed Apr 15 13:33:12 2015 UTC,Right?! Just by looking at the facade and its placement in the park it's so easy to skip over. But I have so many great memories at this show.
Themepark,32n9rz,tealcandtrip,3,Wed Apr 15 14:55:47 2015 UTC,"Two additions: take advantage of singles lines as much as you can except for on the Hollywood Rollercoaster.  The main line loads much faster than the singles line on that ride.  Singles lines are especially useful for Dr Doom, Forbidden Journey (though its worth doing the full line once), Hulk, Transformers, and Spiderman.  Despicable Me has the slowest line in the park for the worst experience, so you might consider knocking that out very early or very late.  It's okay but not immersive and they load Express Pass over the normal line way too often."
Themepark,32n9rz,tdt0005,1 point,Wed Apr 15 13:30:44 2015 UTC,"Wow great additions. I don't know how I left out the single riders line. My family and I use this every opportunity we get. Love it. Especially for Revenge of the Mummy and the Hulk. To be honest with you, I skip Minion Mayhem as well. It's the third incarnation of the ride since the early 90's and I just don't care anymore. Not worth the wait."
Themepark,32n9rz,tdt0005,2,Wed Apr 15 14:54:12 2015 UTC,"Doesn't Universal Studios open an hour before IOA? I know that was the case when I was there. As a result, the HE will not start running until IOA opens. What we did was ride Gringotts, then booked it back to Minion Mayhem (2nd longest wait in the park) and walked right on, then did Rip Ride Rocket 2-3 times with no wait, then went back to HE within a few minutes of opening. We tried to do Transformers first, but it was down. So we knocked out all the headliners in USO (minus transformers) and rode Forbidden Journey, all only 30 minutes into the general public opening. Not bad. Now if only Hulk hadn't been such a long line, the day would have been perfect."
Themepark,32n9rz,tdt0005,1 point,Wed Apr 15 23:29:32 2015 UTC,"You may be right, depending on the day. Also I always skip Minion Mayhem."
Themepark,32n9rz,tdt0005,2,Wed Apr 15 23:32:04 2015 UTC,I think it's funny/amusing. Better than the other clones like Spidey/Transformers which are the same ride to me. At least this one makes me laugh. But I can understand skipping it if you are there a lot. I knew lines for it would build so it was an essential part of my RD plan. We had one day to do both parks. The only things we missed were the water rides (it was december) and shows.
Themepark,32gpzw,Apolitik,8,Mon Apr 13 17:40:27 2015 UTC,"At Cedar Point, go to your #1 coaster first unless that is magnum or raptor. Raptors line fills like crazy because it is the first in the park. Save your number 2 coaster for your last ride of the night as they clear the lines regardless of time. If you can, get early entry by staying at a CP hotel. If you want a coaster in the back half of the park, go to the magnum entrance. If you want gate keeper, go to the beach entrance. If you want to rest in the shade, go to frontier trail. If you want millenium, use any entrance, but beach and magnum have shorter lines to get in. If you drink pop (Midwest for soda) buy the souvenir bottle. You can leave a picnic basket outside of the park if you want to eat cheap.   Ride magnum at least twice, once in the second to last seat for the most airtime.   Have fun at my home park, I lived 15 miles away for 13 years and worked there for 3. Enjoy!"

Themepark,32gpzw,whatdoyacallit,3,Mon Apr 13 22:35:33 2015 UTC,"The order of business is the following from busiest to least busy: Saturday, Tuesday (no one knows why but it's true), Sunday, Friday, Monday, Wednesday, Thursday. Thursday evenings are so peaceful.  That being said Mondays in May might mean bus loads of children as it is a popular school trip. I think you'll be fine as it isn't a holiday. Just check the calendar that there isn't another event going on. Sometimes they do concerts."
Themepark,32gpzw,tdt0005,2,Tue Apr 14 01:20:04 2015 UTC,"In my experience, they never open Dragster with the park. Not sure if that is policy or we are just unlucky. That is a toss up for my #1 with Millennium, so we always do Millennium first."
Themepark,32gpzw,whatdoyacallit,4,Tue Apr 14 02:04:52 2015 UTC,You are unlucky unless you went in the first two years after it opened which was what felt like 75% downtime. CP makes every effort to open the major rides in the morning except for during the fall when they are insanely short staffed.
Themepark,32gpzw,tdt0005,3,Tue Apr 14 02:15:04 2015 UTC,"I've been probably 6 or 7 times. Most recently was fall 2013, and before that it was probably 2010. Never seen it open at early entry for resort guests.   It has also broken down at least once every trip while I was in the loading station. I'm just really unlucky I guess."
Themepark,32gpzw,whatdoyacallit,3,Tue Apr 14 02:30:58 2015 UTC,"Oh it definitely has uptime issues, but I've usually found it open when the park opens early. It's my favorite to go to first because it is least likely to be broken that time of day."
Themepark,32gpzw,whatdoyacallit,1 point,Tue Apr 14 02:43:24 2015 UTC,So we already bought the FLP tickets for the day. How much does it cost to stay at one of the Cedar Point hotels? How expensive are they? Around the cost of staying somewhere in town? Or slightly more or way more expensive?
Themepark,32gpzw,cmanastasia22,2,Tue Apr 14 12:15:27 2015 UTC,"They tend to be pretty pricy. I would definitely consider them if your staying at a hotel in the area anyway. Otherwise, get there as early as you can with your fast pass."
Themepark,32gpzw,DylanTheDespot,1 point,Tue Apr 14 13:01:38 2015 UTC,"Looks like staying Sunday night into Monday morning will cost $144. Since we are splitting, $72 isn't bad since it includes parking and you get an hour early entry to the park. Looks like the list of early-entry rides this year are:   GateKeeper Millennium Force Maverick Raptor Iron Dragon Rougarou Planet Snoopy Ocean Motion Midway Carousel   Suggestions on which to ride before the park opens?

Themepark,32gpzw,DylanTheDespot,3,Tue Apr 14 03:47:52 2015 UTC,"To be honest, I've read about all the Skyrush lap bar hate, and I think it may be over-hyped. I had a similar experience with the odd lap bars on Goliath at SFGA (the ride attendant pushed the thing as far as it would go [I'm a thin guy]). The lap bar was one thing, but that stupid shin restraint gave me bruises. It wasn't comfortable at all, but I forgot about all of that the second the ride started. Hopefully Skyrush leaves me with only fond memories as well :)"

If you really want to hit Ka keep that in mind. Since you're hitting Cedar Point too...if you really want to ride Dragster then jump in line as soon as you see it running. It goes down a lot due to wind."
Themepark,32gpzw,RollerCoasterMatt,2,Fri Apr 24 01:44:02 2015 UTC,"That's what I hear. El Toro is definitely the ride I'm most excited to hit. We have Fast Lane Plus passes for Cedar Point, so getting on Dragster should be easy. Do you recommend getting the Flash Pass for SFGAdv? It's a mid-May Thursday. I doubt it will be very busy, but the park is only open from 10:30-6 that day..."
Themepark,32gpzw,nthdesign,1 point,Fri Apr 24 12:06:05 2015 UTC,"The only time I've visited SFGAdv so far was on a Saturday in August and it was crazy busy. I doubt you'll have that problem on a Thursday in mid May. I would avoid buying the Flash Pass in advance (Not sure if that's a thing?) and buy it when you get there if it happens to be crazy, which again I very much doubt."
Themepark,32gpzw,nthdesign,1 point,Fri Apr 24 22:58:59 2015 UTC,"Oddly enough, I personally LOVE SkyRush's restraints. On my legs, it feels simply like a weighted briefcase on your lap. It leaves you gloriously open to be tossed and turned around the ride. Make sure to ride SkyRush on one of the outer seats!"
Themepark,32gn05,3noir,5,Mon Apr 13 17:17:29 2015 UTC,"Are you planning on going to both parks? If so I would definitely say two days. It's not even that you couldn't get around both in one day. You could, but you simple will not be able to ride the headliners at either park midday without out waiting 2+ hours.  If I were you, I would get a ticket for both parks, RUN straight to Harry Potter at open, do both sides, then do the headliners for what ever side you're on, then do the same thing the next day. The lines/crowds aren't that bad in August, but even still Harry Potter and Spiderman/Transformers and Hulk/Rockit fill up so fast it's uncanny."
Themepark,32gn05,Waitthisisntfacebook,4,Mon Apr 13 17:52:27 2015 UTC,"Excuse my ignorance, the two parks are Islands of Adventure and Universal Studios, right?  I guess I need to learn more about these.  Is one geared more towards kids v/s adults than the other?"
Themepark,32gn05,Waitthisisntfacebook,3,Mon Apr 13 18:03:51 2015 UTC,I should also mention that I've been to these parks 50+ times each so I can give you a ride by ride game plan if you want it.
Themepark,32gn05,Waitthisisntfacebook,4,Mon Apr 13 18:14:21 2015 UTC,"Alright, you guys are asking for it so here goes. Keep in mind this all opinion and based off my personal experiences. Fast Pass is helpful but optional. As far as eating goes I would definitely recommend bringing your own or the Meal Plan, SO worth it. This is all assuming you have two days and want to wait in the shortest lines possible. First things first… Getting Harry Potter out of the way:  Be there before the gates open and book it to Harry Potter. In this game plan I am assuming you are going to the ""studio"" park first because it has the newer Harry Potter attractions. It’s going to feel weird passing all the other attractions to get to this section but it is well worth it.  1. Harry Potter and the Escape from Gringrotts - this is the newest attraction and its Harry Potter so it will fill up the quickest. If a huge line hasn’t formed after your first ride I would consider riding it again. At this point you can either have a look around in Diagon Alley (Knockturn Alley, Olivanders, The Knight Bus, etc.) or go straight to….  2. Hogwarts Express - this is a ride but it is also a way to get to the other park from the rear of the complex. It will require you to have a “park-to-park” ticket. After this you will be in “Islands of Adventure” in the Hogsmade made section of Harry Potter.  3. Harry Potter and the Forbidden Journey - this is where it gets tricky. At this point the line might not be THAT bad but you may want to consider it being the first thing you ride tomorrow, as the two Harry Potter rides fill up so fast. 4. (If you have small children) Flight of the Hippogriff 4. (If you don’t have small children) Dragon Challenge - again, at this point you can have a look around Hogsmade or move on.  *from here you can either ride the Hogwarts Express back to Studios or stay in Islands of Adventure. To me, it just depends on what you want to do first.  After Harry Potter - Universal Studios (Rides first/Shows later): 1. Hollywood Rip Ride Rockit 2. Despicable Me Minion Mayhem 3. Shrek 4-D 4. TRANSFORMERS The Ride 3D  5. Revenge of the Mummy  6. Disaster!  7. Men in Black Alien Attack 8. The Simpsons Ride (I would actually consider riding this before Men in Black but you have to back track) 9. Kang and Kudos’ Twirl ‘n’ Hurl 10. E.T. Adventure (I would also consider riding this before Kang and Kudos’ but again, you have to back track) 11.(If you have small children) Woody Woodpecker’s Nuthouse Coater  *at this point you will be in Woody Woodpecker’s Kidzone. This is a great chance for parents to chill and watch their kids run around (Curious George Goes to Town/Fievel’s Playland)and begin to see the “show” attractions. The Shows (any order is really okay):  1. A Day in the Park with Barney (obviously for very small children) 2. Animal Actors on Location 3. Universal’s Horror Make-Up Show (one of my favorites) 4. Terminator 2 3D 5. Twister…Ride it Out  6. Beetlejuice’s Graveyard Revue 7. Fear Factor Live  UNIVERSAL STUIDOS COMPLETE, NOW SHOP AROUND AND CATCH THE PARADE. After Harry Potter - Islands of Adventure  1. The Incredible Hulk Coaster - ride Harry Potter and the Forbidden Journey first if you haven’t already or wish to ride it again. 2. The Amazing Adventures of Spider-Man - My personal favorite! 3. Doctor Doom’s Fear Fall 4. Storm’s Force Accelatron - Honestly, I always skip this one. It’s basically the teacups ride at Disney, and I just have better things to do.  5. Dudley Do-Right’s Ripsaw Falls/Popeye and Pluto’s Bilge-Rat Barges - only ride these at this point if you are okay with being EXTREMELY wet the rest of the day. I always save these two for last.  6. Jurassic Park River Adventure  7. Pteranodon Flyers 8. Flight of the Hippogriff or Dragon Challenge (yes again!) 9. The Cat In the Hat! 10. High in the Sky Seuss Trolley Train Ride (the one ride here I’ve never been on, no particular reason why) 11. Caro-Seuss-el / One Fish, Two Fish, Red Fish, Blue Fish  12. Poseidon’s Fury - another favorite! 13. The Eighth Voyage of Sinbad  14. Re-ride your favorites if you want to wait and/or ride Dudley/Popeye if you haven’t already. **You’re done! Now That you don’t have to worry about lines I would go back and explore the more detailed areas such as Jurassic Park and Harry Potter.  Good luck!  EDIT 1: I forgot to mention to take advantage of the single riders lane in several rides if you don't mind being separated from you're group. Your whole party can use these lines and they will use you as fillers for odd seats out. Huge time saver."

Themepark,32gn05,Lilusa,2,Wed Apr 15 03:34:10 2015 UTC,"One park is more ""movie rides"" and the other is more ""thrill rides"".  Each side has a Harry Potter section (Hogwarts at IoA and Diagon Alley at Univ.)  You can use the Hogwarts express to travel from park to park but you need a park to park ticket."
Themepark,32gn05,Waitthisisntfacebook,1 point,Tue Apr 14 16:17:51 2015 UTC,That is correct.  The majority of the rides at both parks are going to be great for kids and adults with the exception of the few roller coasters and water rides with drops depending on there age level.
Themepark,32gn05,bryan_rothwell,3,Mon Apr 13 18:08:28 2015 UTC,I would definitely recommend a two day park to park pass.
Themepark,32gn05,CustomMadeGJ,3,Mon Apr 13 20:28:34 2015 UTC,"Can it be done it one day? Yes. But I went I'm Nov when there is virtually nobody there. We only had to skip one or two rides we wanted to do, but even so, I'm looking forward to going back and taking it slow. Ride a couple things twice, eat at various places. Take it all in."
Themepark,32gn05,tideblue,2,Mon Apr 13 21:12:53 2015 UTC,Two days if you want to take it slow. One day if you got your shit together.   No judgement either way I can do both parks in about 5 hours and hit all the good rides. It depends on the group you're with and what rides you want to do.   PM me if you have any questions I worked there for 2 years and facilitated orientation for universal attractions.
Themepark,32gn05,tdt0005,2,Mon Apr 13 21:05:04 2015 UTC,"Two days if visiting in August. There's always the rush before kids go back to school, so two easy-going days should do it. My advice is to do a sit-down meal at Mythos on your visit to IOA, and also bring a change of clothes so you can do the water rides. No Express needed."
Themepark,32gn05,rpungello,2,Mon Apr 13 23:51:11 2015 UTC,"Do two. I've done both parks in one day twice. But it was because it was a Disney trip and I just wanted a day to see Universal/HP. This past trip the only thing we waited for more than 10-15 minutes was Hulk, which went extremely slow for some reason. At rope drop we rushed to Diagon Alley and rode Gringotts with no wait, then went back to the front of the park and did Minions with no wait and Rocket 3 times with no wait. Transformers was down, so we went back to Diagon Alley to take the Hogwarts Express, again no wait. There was a bit of a wait for Forbidden Journey, but not bad. Then we did Hulk, Spiderman, lunch, the train ride in Suess Landing and the Cat in the Hat ride. Then looked around Hogsmeade and did Dragon Challenge and FJ single rider, and rode the HE back. Men in Black several times, Simpsons ride and had a donut in Moe's. Transformers, Shrek, Mummy, MIB again, then we left before the park even closed. Walked about 17 miles that day."
Themepark,32gn05,nukii,1 point,Tue Apr 14 02:45:19 2015 UTC,"rode Gringotts with no wait   I hate you so much. When I was there, I waited 3+ hours for that ride (admittedly it had just opened recently)."
Themepark,32gn05,missmudblood,2,Fri Apr 17 04:09:18 2015 UTC,"Two days in summer for sure.  Expect enormous crowds.  Would suggest hitting Harry Potter areas at park open if possible, otherwise you're looking at a 2 hour wait for those rides.  FYI, if you stay on site you get VIP passes that let you skip lines.  Some version of that is also purchasable for those not staying there."
Themepark,32gn05,tideblue,2,Tue Apr 14 12:00:50 2015 UTC,"I would say that if you're interested in getting the majority of the rides done, then absolutely two days. With a basic park-to-park pass you can squeeze in everything in one day, but you won't get to appreciate the excellent ambience and the really detailed areas like the Wizarding World. For a lot of really good guides for your trip, I recommend Orlando Informer. They're solely based on Universal Orlando and have great articles for every aspect of your trip, including a calendar with crowd sizes to get a really good idea of what to expect. Also, I'm a huge Universal park-goer and would be happy to give you tips from my own experience. :) I hope you have a great trip!"
Themepark,32gn05,1GoodDad,2,Tue Apr 14 15:38:25 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't recommend a one-day visit to both parks for a first-timer. The on-site hotels are a great value, but I wouldn't recommend anyone buy Express before they get in the park."

Themepark,32g8l8,neon,1 point,Mon Apr 13 17:21:10 2015 UTC,"I need to look into it more, but it's highly possible that this option agreement was signed well before Disney acquired Marvel. Most of the Marvel theme park licenses (from my existing understanding) were regional so that they could sell to multiple entities in different regions."
Themepark,32g8l8,fermenter85,1 point,Mon Apr 13 17:24:05 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure the deal with Marvel goes back to the ""Dubai Landrush"" of the mid-2000's, when a lot of parks were announced in the Middle East. Six Flags, Legoland, Ferarri, Paramount, Universal, Bollywood film companies, and more were all announced, then languished. A few of these projects resurfaced other places, but the overall problem was that Dubai just isn't as accessible or as desirable for tourists from Europe and abroad as was hoped for.  This is, of course, before India, Malaysia, China, and other parts of Asia were looked at as accepting of outside cultures and business.  Edit: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dubailand"
Themepark,32g8l8,neon,1 point,Mon Apr 13 18:07:55 2015 UTC,"The deal was signed years ago, before Disney owned Marvel. The park was delayed for a few years. Also, they might not have fought it because Disney has no plans to build anything in the Middle East, and they're entitled to franchising fees, same as with Universal Orlando, which amounts to publicity and profit with very little risk (and not much out of their own pocket)."
Themepark,32g8l8,tdt0005,1 point,Mon Apr 13 17:59:46 2015 UTC,Makes sense and that's what I guessed. Didn't know this project had been delayed that long is all.   Disney isn't happy about universal though as it prevents them from using marvel at Disneyworld.  But that contract is now up in just a few years so we will likely see uni have to re theme eveything in the next 5 years in Florida.

Themepark,321m64,Waitthisisntfacebook,2,Fri Apr 10 03:16:45 2015 UTC,"There's not any concept art out yet, but we know this ride will feature a long jeep-like ride vehicle that you load inside the building, then go outside for the first scene. The vehicles will be trackless, riding on concrete with no visible track.   From the outside scene you enter the large gate (as you can see they're building) into the ride-building. Inside you'll encounter giant bugs and/or bats and catch a glimpse of Kong. Most scenes will utilize 3D screens, although sometimes just for background with animatronics in foreground. There will be a big 3D scene similar to Kong 360 in Hollywood. And the last scene will have a full size Kong animatronic, to essentially wave bye bye as you pass by. There's more to it than that, but that's the stuff everyone already kind of knows so far.  And apparently there will be something else after you unload, on your way out.. but no one is sure yet what it is. Maybe a photo spot, like they had back on the old ride."

If you want to do Soak City too, June is perfect because it's not quite as crowded as July and August.  But honestly, I suggest going in May and staying at a resort with an indoor water park (Kalahari, Great Wolf Lodge, or Castaway Bay) if you want to do the water park and coasters.  Kalahari has a water coaster which is better than all the slides at Soak City."
Themepark,31vpoz,ScottyGefell,3,Wed Apr 8 15:17:56 2015 UTC,Kalahari looks like a good compromise. Have you been? Is it as good as it looks online? Do you think 2 adults could have a good time there?  Thanks for your response!
Themepark,31vpoz,wuu,3,Wed Apr 8 15:53:24 2015 UTC,"Kalahari is fucking amazing. I go once a year for a convention and I spend a lot of time at the waterpark. They have a huge hottub bar and you can get these huge mixed drink that are $20, super delicious, fairly strong and last you a long time. Waterslides are a whole new experience when you are kind of tipsy, and that water rollercoaster is fun as hell, but my favorite is the big toilet bowl slide.  I've been there three times and haven't even seen the outside waterpark, or the zoo. There is tons to do, but it is expensive, and there are probably a ton of little kids around (the convention I go to sells out the place, so there are not very many little kids that weekend). I can't wait for this year."
Themepark,31vpoz,Doomed,1 point,Wed Apr 8 20:21:54 2015 UTC,Kalahari is great. The only downside is how much it costs (I'm pretty sure the other places in the area are cheaper). I had fun as a kid at Castaway Bay as well. As an adult I'd probably have more fun at Kalahari.

I haven't been there since Gatekeeper opened but before that the crowds were very thin.  But plan on not being able to do that. Since you're already having to skip rides, going to the water park means you skip even more."

We are talking 5 minutes for Raptor, 15 for Millennium Force, walk on all day for Magnum.  Also, $35 for tickets to CP is amazingly cheap.  Hell, it's cheap for any park, especially one that size.

They say that they can't find any companys that offer rides for tall peoples over 195 CM   Here is a quote from a mail from Liseberg Themepark   ""Unfortunately, it is difficult to find this type of attraction without shoulder harnesses in the market, there is no one (that I know of) that can provide an attraction of this kind without shoulder harnesses. We have had contact before you and I and I can promise you that I have on several occasions since taken this up with several manufacturers when I meet them at various fairs or the like and I hope that in the future they can construct cool and exciting attractions without  shoulder harnesses (or at least without an upper length limit).""  Liseberg is refering to their new attraction Mechanica that is a Star Shape ride WITH shoulder harnesses and a upper lenght limit 195 CM.   Link: http://liseberg.com/en/home/Amusement-Park/Rides--Attractions/Mechanica-2015/  I still belive that it is many many cool rides (not just roller coasters) that is out there availible for tall peoples over 195 CM. Please link to exemples. Thanks."
Themepark,3112za,Xorondras,1 point,Thu Apr 2 08:25:28 2015 UTC,"Ok, I can understand that there aren't many rides like Mechanica without shoulder harnesses because those rides generate quite some omnidirectional forces where your upper body needs to be ""strapped down"". Otherwise you would risk serious spine injuries.  There are some rides that use shoulder harnesses that slide down from the top and are adjustable to height instead of the pivoting mechanism that is often used."

I would suggest you look up statistics how many people are over 195 cm in northern Europe (my guess: quite a few) and then show the park this data about how much money they are losing, and that they should tell their manufacturers to increase the upper limits.  Just my 2 cents. Good luck!"

Themepark,30xbs0,mktuba,8,Tue Mar 31 13:52:36 2015 UTC,I was with the author until the bit about making it more kid friendly. Being an adult with no children I tend to stay away from Magic Kingdom despite having an annual pass and being a local. I go to Epcot because I know I can have some drinks and for the most part not have to interact with many screaming/crying children.   I love the idea of updating innovations as there is plenty of potential but it needs to be updated constantly to show people the new cutting edge tech. That might not be something Disney wants to maintain but I think that's what Walt envisioned.   It would be great to see a smart house with all interconnected devices and how robots will become less science fiction and more integrated into our daily lives. How about self-driving cars? New tech used for prosthesis? Tons of things they could teach people.
Themepark,30xbs0,karnek,4,Tue Mar 31 14:19:30 2015 UTC,"I don't think it would necessarily draw more kids, it would just entertain the ones that are already there. It would also keep the kids activities centralized."
Themepark,30xbs0,DadsinGrads,6,Tue Mar 31 16:08:23 2015 UTC,"So... Just throw a bunch of Pixar shit and the Best Buy showroom in?  Nah.   EPCOT is an outlier in the Walt Disney park systems. It's weird and cold in Future World and old fashioned to the point of being quaint in World Showcase. Adding a bunch of cartoons to the place is not the solution, it creates a bizarre juxtaposition that takes you out of the experience.   There's only one way to ""fix"" Epcot and that's embracing it's oddness. Don't make it another traditional park, utilize the fact that it looks and feels like (architecturally) an alien race set up a simulation/science base to understand humanity and what earth life was like."
Themepark,30xbs0,tdt0005,3,Tue Mar 31 18:05:58 2015 UTC,"Strangely, you just hit the nail on the head. The look and feel of Epcot are currently the only thing that makes it unique/worth visiting.

I am not enamored with any of the attractions. Too much dead space in the park. I don't drink and the food is really not all that good compared to price. I spent $70 at the F&W and was still hungry.   I like some of the authors ideas, some easy updates would really go a long way in making a great park."

Themepark,30hiri,skwigger,21,Fri Mar 27 12:55:00 2015 UTC,"This isn't a tin foil hat conspiracy thing.  My understanding is that the Florida parks are having massive trouble with people taking things like those stupid selfie sticks unto rides.  I hear it's getting ridiculously out of hand - even more so than the usual cell phone shenanigans you see at your local regional parks.    I've always enjoyed the 'no stuff in line' policy at parks.  I love seeing the efficiency of a ride when there are no backpacks involved.  You know the drill.  Seats unlock, old riders get off, gates open, new riders walk straight through the train and fiddle with their backpacks in the cubby for five minutes, slowly meander back to the train, and gates finally close.    The cell phone policy is tough for me as a single rider, though.  When I'm in a 60 minute queue I definitely make use of my phone to pass the time.  I've always considered bringing a little paperback book but I'm not sure they would allow that, either.  Holiday World does it well with their in-station locker system but that's very taxing on the ride operators and certainly does not speed up operations.  The only way to speed up operations is to do what the airlines do - physical limit the amount of shit people can bring with them into a station."
Themepark,30hiri,EricGarbo,2,Fri Mar 27 14:09:14 2015 UTC,The thing about Rip Ride Rocket is they do not allow ANYTHING on the ride. Not even if you have it in a ZIPPED pouch which I just find ridiculous.
Themepark,30hiri,tdt0005,1 point,Sun Mar 29 05:33:34 2015 UTC,"Well, it's the same as Holiday World, then. I've had ride operators ask me to flip out my pockets to make sure I didn't have a phone on me."
Themepark,30hiri,EricGarbo,14,Sun Mar 29 15:27:53 2015 UTC,"What I heard at IOA from a random cast member was that the real problems leading to the ""loose object"" crackdown were assholes slinging handfuls of loose change from the rides. On Hulk, they were slinging them at the sidewalk from the top of the first inversion.  On Dueling Dragons, they were slinging them at the other trains on the fly-bys.  This is supposedly why they quit running the dragons properly, wasting B&M's brilliant engineering.  If metal detectors can bring the dueling back and speed up the queues, I personally don't mind going through it."

This is supposedly why they quit running the dragons properly, wasting B&M's brilliant engineering. If metal detectors can bring the dueling back and speed up the queues, I personally don't mind going through it.   Not quite.  They stopped dueling the dragons because someone's leg got hit and subsequently injured by something.  They took precaution and stopped dueling the trains for a while, and eventually decided it was just safest to not duel them anymore again.  Throwing coins at just the right moment on that coaster has like a 1 in a million chance of doing anything significant to the other train."

One guy got hit in multiple places.  The intent would be to pelt the other riders; it would never affect the operation of the train itself."
Themepark,30hiri,MaFratelli,5,Fri Mar 27 20:17:41 2015 UTC,"Well, I feel bad for anyone who didn't get to ride them while they were dueling.  It's a real shame because they are just okay layouts as stand alone coasters IMO.    I got to ride both in the front one day.  That's only time I've every ""winced"" on a coaster thinking we were going to hit."
Themepark,30hiri,Hedgey,3,Fri Mar 27 20:33:46 2015 UTC,The dueling is what really made the coasters. It's a damn shame they don't duel anymore. I'm glad to have experienced it at it's full potential.
Themepark,30hiri,SubClavianGroove,2,Fri Mar 27 21:09:52 2015 UTC,I rode them when they dueled and I do think the new potter expansions have added a lot to the coasters. I think they are still pretty fantastic.

Before I get on the ride, i always secure the phone in a zipped pocket and absolutely never take it out and this has never been an issue.  I really don't like messing with the lockers especially just to store a cell phone. Kinda sucks that some people ruin it for others."
Themepark,30hiri,akadros,2,Sat Mar 28 01:57:45 2015 UTC,"It's one thing that REALLY puts a big plus in the Disney column for me. I take very little too, but it's almost impossible to go to Universal without have to deal with the hassle of the lockers at some point. At Disney you can take an entire freaking backpack with you. No mandatory lockers. I think the only thing they don't allow is balloons."
Themepark,30hiri,tdt0005,3,Sun Mar 29 05:36:29 2015 UTC,"The issue is two fold. People are bringing items with them that are both slowing down the loading process and, most importantly, a risk to the safety of other guests."
Themepark,30hiri,Tchnique,3,Fri Mar 27 16:44:05 2015 UTC,"The park can do anything they want.  When you buy a ticket and enter through those turnstiles, you are basically signing a contract that says you will follow the park rules.  In this case, their rule is to NOT bring items onto the rides, and obviously people have been breaking those rules.  This is just a test of a solution to solve this issue, because people will never stop trying to bring things onto rides with them.  If people were to not try to sneak items onto the rides, this wouldn't happen.  I am cool with any park doing whatever they need to do to keep me and everyone else safe on their rides."
Themepark,30hiri,Woirol,1 point,Sat Mar 28 00:29:42 2015 UTC,"This just reminded me of something that, at the time, I was probably too excited/having too much of a good time to truly process, but on a visit to Universal Hollywood last summer, on the Mummy ride, we were made to store all backpacks/other items in these tiny lockers before queuing/riding. Which is weird, because AFAIK I've never been asked to store anything anywhere prior to queuing. I mean sure, at lots of parks (Magic Mountain, or here in the UK at Alton Towers) they make you stow backpacks etc. in special containers on the train platform, but never before queueing...   And the annoying part of being made to use these lockers was that it was unfortunately not a seamless, convenient experience. In fact it was anything but. The electronic fingerprint (I think I recall?) system they had in place to negate the need for carrying keys etc. was constantly breaking; people all around us were having a hard time with it. In fact, one of the members of our party was unable to retrieve her bags after riding. This actually worked out for us because when she did finally get her bags out, they gave us all front-of-queue tickets for the Transformers ride which had the longest wait of the day and we just happened to be planning to do that next....! But still, it was quite a pain to have to go through all that just to store our bags for a ride which doesn't even invert... In fact I rode it ten years before that (man, I'm old) and we definitely took all loose articles with us at that time....   So I'm wondering what exactly they're hoping to achieve with this new locker system....? I mean, finally cracking down on GoPros/selfie sticks is fine (trust some idiots to ruin on-ride filming for the rest of us sensible people!) but I feel the locker system is a step too far...."
Themepark,30hiri,peanutismint,3,Fri Mar 27 23:31:59 2015 UTC,"There is absolutely nothing wrong with the locker situation.  They could charge you for them, like every other park out there, but they provide them for free for the course of your wait and ride.    The main reason they have lockers on their attractions is because MOST of the attractions have separate load and unload areas, so a bin in the station would not work properly.  That's why Top Thrill Dragster and Millennium Force at Cedar Point have lockers over bins, separate stations.  As a frequent theme park visitor, I am sick of the selfie/GoPro sticks.  I'm sick of people sneaking them onto rides to try and film the ride.  I will not hesitate a minute to turn someone in for bringing one with them.  I'm not about to get hit by their loose item, nor watch anyone else get hit."
Themepark,30hiri,Woirol,1 point,Sat Mar 28 00:16:58 2015 UTC,It's worth noting that temporary lockers while you are riding any ride at Universal are FREE.
Themepark,30hiri,SomeEthiopian,1 point,Mon Mar 30 12:27:00 2015 UTC,I'm honestly wondering how effective this really will be. Because LOTS of pants have metal zippers and also what about glasses? Are they gonna start making you remove them even with a strap? And also not everything is made out of metal. You could possibly have something plastic on you too that no one will know about until it's too late. My mom also wears a waist pack on many rides there and has NEVER had a problem.
Themepark,30hiri,TheHalonSystem,0,Fri Jun 26 18:25:42 2015 UTC,"Personally I feel it a bit redundant, them already having the lockers. Do you think they're gonna do it with Hulk too?"

Themepark,30hiri,CurbYourNewUrbanism,8,Fri Mar 27 16:14:02 2015 UTC,"People are constantly trying to bring stuff with them onto the ride. The lockers are free for the duration of the wait time and then some.   Someone lost an eye because a clown thought it would be funny to throw a coin from one dragons train to the next. When personal injury become a concern, and as a result lawsuits, a park is going to do everything they can to make sure that doesn't happen. Park management is trying to protect their investment. Also when a park gets hit with the unsafe stigma, it's extremely hard to shake off."

Themepark,306l1o,SubClavianGroove,2,Wed Mar 25 01:18:40 2015 UTC,I think it's more about beautifying the park as a whole and blending the new Harry Potter area more with the Shrek. They are back to back.
Themepark,306l1o,tideblue,1 point,Wed Mar 25 02:34:08 2015 UTC,I know i'm horribly late but......Bring back Hitchcock!!!!
Themepark,306l1o,tideblue,1 point,Tue Mar 24 23:50:57 2015 UTC,This is in Hollywood.
Themepark,306l1o,JJKalai,1 point,Wed Mar 25 18:14:13 2015 UTC,"Haha! Sorry, I should have been more specific. This is the Hollywood Shrek."
Themepark,306l1o,SpyKyle,1 point,Wed Mar 25 00:01:05 2015 UTC,"Looks nice. This is the least-themed attraction in the Hollywood park, and it would have looked really out of place next to Hogsmeade without some improvements."
Themepark,306xhz,SomeEthiopian,8,Tue Mar 24 23:37:25 2015 UTC,I don't understand why our news stations make a story out of rides breaking down every time it happens. Rides break down daily...
Themepark,306xhz,deadmemories1,1 point,Wed Mar 25 12:40:37 2015 UTC,Ratings? It must be a slow news day in Orlando...
Themepark,306xhz,JJKalai,0,Wed Mar 25 15:22:46 2015 UTC,"Standard break downs are a bit different from ones that require fire department involvement. I completely understand saying this most of the time - such as when a guest calls 911 when there's a 5 minute ride delay that the staff remedies themselves - but when taxpayer dollars are spent to solve a downtime, and the emergency calls go out over public radio airwaves, I don't fault the news for poking around."
Themepark,306xhz,sparkinspace,6,Wed Mar 25 18:21:00 2015 UTC,"So it's news when a ride system shuts down during a fault, like it's designed to do?  Also news, when I stepped on the brake pedal this morning my car stopped."
Themepark,306xhz,robotshoelaces,2,Wed Mar 25 15:18:45 2015 UTC,It literally stopped on the final break run...
Themepark,306xhz,TechnoColor5,1 point,Wed Mar 25 16:36:54 2015 UTC,i wonder if you get any compensation from the park for being stuck on there that long?
Themepark,306xhz,asshat13,1 point,Wed Mar 25 13:20:26 2015 UTC,They absolutely will. I'm sure Universal had guest relations people waiting for the guests stuck on the attraction.
Themepark,3065qe,mktuba,8,Tue Mar 24 20:14:24 2015 UTC,"I don't totally disagree with the sentiment here. But just HOW are they supposed to get the money to make it happen. As the article note's there bleeding attendance fast these days.  Less people in the park, mean's they have less money for new rides not more."
Themepark,3065qe,neon,5,Tue Mar 24 21:31:54 2015 UTC,"Sometimes it takes investing in the park before you see a return. The new killer whale habitat is a good example of that. They're not really losing money at this point, just not making as much as they could be."
Themepark,3065qe,scottwalker88,5,Tue Mar 24 21:42:58 2015 UTC,I don't think the new killer whale habitat will change the opinion of anybody who was pissed off by Blackfish.
Themepark,3065qe,boredinbiloxi,-1,Tue Mar 24 21:56:10 2015 UTC,The Blackfish thing was mostly a fad and will fade away. A documentary like that comes out every year that is supposed to change an industry and it never happens.
Themepark,3065qe,scottwalker88,-1,Tue Mar 24 22:31:40 2015 UTC,I hope it does fade away but there was a massive reaction to it and it's difficult to see people's reactions as I really do like SeaWorld and there is a bit of irony with it in that most people would know very little about killer whales if it wasn't for SeaWorld.  I also find it confusing that people don't seem as pissed off about Dolphins being in SeaWorld or any other animal plus they seem to beokay with animals in zoos and Busch Gardens.
Themepark,3065qe,skwigger,1 point,Tue Mar 24 22:36:02 2015 UTC,"I have friends from out of state that never even heard of the documentary. I also have friends in state that saw it, and said they'd never go to Sea World. I never knew them to be big animal lovers, and one of their kids recently had a field trip to Sea World, so I guess they're over it."
Themepark,3065qe,SomeEthiopian,1 point,Wed Mar 25 09:19:44 2015 UTC,This is Busch we're talking about.
Themepark,3065qe,tideblue,4,Wed Mar 25 13:59:07 2015 UTC,"They could use a few new family rides (Larson Flying Scooters, a pirate ship, a spinning coaster or mine train, a Mack Twist and Splash, a Rapids ride or log flume, Etc) and a new simulator portion for Wild Artic before the parks needs another huge B&M coaster. These would be low-cost additions, and would strengthen the sales of Quick Queue, which is almost pure profit. The park has a lot of space for small additions, and would bring it more in-lime with Busch Gardens."
Themepark,3065qe,MaFratelli,2,Tue Mar 24 21:34:54 2015 UTC,I'm with you on some family friendly upgrades as well. Low cost would be key but I think you're on the right path.
Themepark,3065qe,tideblue,1 point,Tue Mar 24 21:58:45 2015 UTC,The competition in Orlando have the best family rides on Earth.  What they don't have is more than 3 serious coasters in any single park.
Themepark,3065qe,Imaginos64,1 point,Wed Mar 25 17:41:13 2015 UTC,"Sure, good point. But, two 3-train B&M's mean they can handle quite a crowd. Most times I go to SeaWorld, these two rides have 5-15 minute waits, compared to 1/2 hour waits at Atlantis and double that at Antartica. This tells me that either the family rides are very popular, or what they have is low capacity. More family rides are needed first, from what I've seen.  If you're a coaster enthusiast, Busch Gardens should be your first stop in Florida."
Themepark,3065qe,yaminub,2,Wed Mar 25 17:47:06 2015 UTC,"Seaworld needs to offer more to justify the price of admission ($75 apparently, so $300 for a family of four) and draw people to the park. Having Disney and Universal as competition can't be easy. I bet most families would easily choose those parks over Seaworld if something had to get cut. After all, $300 to bring the family to a glorified aquarium with few (Great, but few) rides probably isn't inciting for a lot of people. Busch Gardens Tampa seems like a much more well rounded park."
Themepark,3065qe,scottwalker88,1 point,Tue Mar 24 22:46:31 2015 UTC,"I've never understood the problem with the shows.   I'm pretty sure if the animals didn't want to participate they would refuse to. The crew only uses positive reinforcement.   The chain hasn't built a B&M for six years with the last being Manta, right? I'd expect a premier ride if anything."
Themepark,305vhs,AceDynamicHero,2,Tue Mar 24 19:00:49 2015 UTC,Firstly which one are you going to? If it's the one in New Braunfels I've been a pass holder for the past 5 years and can pretty much answer anything about the place.
Themepark,305vhs,Santaman346,1 point,Wed Mar 25 05:42:15 2015 UTC,"Whew, I'm happy to see you responded. Yes, it's the New Braunfels location. Please pour your wisdom upon me!"
Themepark,305vhs,Santaman346,2,Wed Mar 25 14:13:13 2015 UTC,"Cool, the souvenir cup is the way to go if your not bringing a cooler. I HIGHLY recommend stopping at an HEB or Walmart near by, buy a cooler, stock up on drinks, put some ice in there and your good. The same goes with food, Schlitterbahn charges around $9-$12 for a single meal so I would pack food to bring with you. I've never gotten aqua socks, the walkways are covered in carpet like material so your feet are never uncomfortable. If you really want the aqua socks but if you can go without them get your tickets at an HEB nearby. I work there and the tickets are usually $15-$20 cheaper than at the main gate. I've never rented a cabana before but I can tell you that unless you plan on spending a lot of time at the cabana, don't rent it. You'll probably spend most of your day walking around the parks."
Themepark,305vhs,Santaman346,2,Wed Mar 25 15:57:16 2015 UTC,"I would say get there when it opens but it don't really make a difference. The lines won't get longer than maybe a 30 minute wait so you can really get there whenever you like. The parks are fun, you'll enjoy it. The lifeguards can be real dicks though but yeah if you have any other questions just ask."
Themepark,305vhs,Santaman346,1 point,Wed Mar 25 16:00:00 2015 UTC,"Wow, thanks man! That's really informative and helpful!"

Themepark,3020c5,olly24uk,3,Mon Mar 23 20:59:15 2015 UTC,Intersting to see it with the lights on. If you watch it until the end you see the 'elevator' part that actually moves down with the card on it.
Themepark,3020c5,ThePurplePanzy,1 point,Mon Mar 23 21:00:09 2015 UTC,Had a few malfunctions on the test rides I was able to go on before it opened. The car got stuck and wouldn't turn so we got to see the elevator and a few other cool technical things. It's honestly pretty fun when these rides break.
Themepark,301pu2,myrule,2,Mon Mar 23 19:44:45 2015 UTC,It's getting mixed reviews. Lot's of pictures and guest reviews can be found here: here (translated from Dutch)
Themepark,301pu2,logicspeaks,2,Mon Mar 23 19:46:30 2015 UTC,Any theme park that relies that heavily on technology is doomed to become obsolete within 15 years IMO.

Themepark,2zx0pq,RealNotFake,2,Sun Mar 22 23:44:53 2015 UTC,"It's ok if it's a ride that's specifically built around the experience (Splash Mountain), but I agree that it sucks if ou randomly get sprayed in a ride that isn't about water, especially on a cold day"

Themepark,2zngyf,Erkel1273,7,Fri Mar 20 01:15:36 2015 UTC,I didn't know they used the unity engine. Seeing all games that are made these days with that engine and the mods for those games I hope modding for this game becomes a big thing.
Themepark,2zngyf,Arumin,4,Fri Mar 20 08:30:09 2015 UTC,Needs more assembly.
Themepark,2zngyf,Mayor_of_Browntown,2,Fri Mar 20 16:54:36 2015 UTC,Me too! I hope people mod the shit outta some scenery. Like have Comic book mods so you can make your own marvel island and things like that.
Themepark,2zngyf,SubClavianGroove,7,Fri Mar 20 22:54:57 2015 UTC,Promising that they actually care enough to change based on the feedback.
Themepark,2zngyf,KaiserCoaster,1 point,Fri Mar 20 08:18:38 2015 UTC,"Technically, they didn't really admit they changed anything graphics-wise based on the feedback. Of course we all like to hate on them and accuse them of changing, but it's still an assumption. They claim that the graphics in the video were definitely not the final graphics, and that the graphics are next on their to-do list, following core-functionality. They made the upgrade to Unity 5 sound as though it had been planned or at least something they were considering before the trailer and feedback.  The only thing they concretely admit was caused by feedback is the changes to in-game art.   As for the release date, they sort of just casually throw out the word ""summer"" for sharing the Unity5 results. Again, not concretely admitting its due to feedback."

Themepark,2zhf39,ContempoVacationHome,10,Wed Mar 18 16:45:52 2015 UTC,"I assume they will go with something more general such as Disney Studios.  It will make it more appropriate to have a Pixar studios, Lucas Arts, Disney animation, Muppets Studios, etc sections in the park."
Themepark,2zhf39,osmac,6,Wed Mar 18 17:21:59 2015 UTC,"I feel like ""Studios"" is the part that's going away more than likely. The working studio concept is long dead, the parts that remain are scattershot and confusing.... I think it'll be movie/Hollywood themed but veering away from that stagnant and unsuccessful concept. Hollywood Adventure is a name Jim Hill dropped awhile back, and branding wise makes sense."
Themepark,2zhf39,phrogxix,1 point,Wed Mar 18 17:46:28 2015 UTC,"If they actually do that, I hope they're going with that rute in Paris to. The Walt Disney Studio's Park is a disaster"
Themepark,2zhf39,doesntlikeshoes,6,Wed Mar 18 23:32:35 2015 UTC,"My money's on ""Disney('s) Hollywood Adventure"" - ties into a movie based park without being the making of the movies. Lets them open up more to fully realized Star Wars/Marvel/Pixar areas, since the park would be more about experiencing the movies."
Themepark,2zhf39,addisonborn,1 point,Wed Mar 18 21:45:36 2015 UTC,This is the popular theory on a few fan sites as well as with the DHS cast.   We should hear something by August when the D23 expo happens in Anaheim.

Themepark,2zil7z,FireFingers1992,2,Wed Mar 18 21:44:12 2015 UTC,Things that aren't in London: 1. The Harry Potter Studio Tour London / 2. This.
Themepark,2zil7z,Kristofferson1989,2,Thu Mar 19 12:27:41 2015 UTC,"True. In fact, I live in the town where the Harry Potter Studios Tour (Watford) actually is. But it only takes 40 minutes from Central London, and ""proper"" bits of London can take much longer than that. Paramount, although further out, will take a similar amount of time thanks to the already running high speed trains running between St Pancreas and Ebbsfleet. In fact, travel between the two sites could be done in under two hours.   Plus ""Paramount North Kent"" or ""Harry Potter Studios Tour Watford"" doesn't have quite the same ring."
Themepark,2zil7z,Kristofferson1989,1 point,Thu Mar 19 13:01:12 2015 UTC,"Harry Potter isn't even in Watford though. It's on the border of Abbots and Leavesden. Kings Langley train station is actually closer to the studios than Watford Junction, but can't handle the amount of passengers visiting the studio due to small size and limited onward transport options."
Themepark,2zil7z,Kristofferson1989,1 point,Thu Mar 19 14:36:29 2015 UTC,"God can you imagine the chaos if they used King's Langley? Watford Junction station has 5 fast and 3 slow trains an hour into London, a bus station outside, and is in the oyster zone.   The studios has a WD postcode, so I'll go with it being Watford. More than London anyway."
Themepark,2zea99,therapeypanda,3,Tue Mar 17 21:27:05 2015 UTC,"If you purchase a dolphin swim package at Discovery Cove, you get 14 days of consecutive admission to SeaWorld and Aquatica. I believe that Disney sells a 21 Day UK pass. But if you're doing all of the Orlando parks, you may just want the 14 day. Not too sure about Universal though."

I just was pretty sure that 21 day tickets were around last year for not much more money. Think i may have been imagining it! Probably just go for a 14 day ticket, works out about £530ish for all the major parks."
Themepark,2zea99,tman9494,3,Tue Mar 17 23:43:46 2015 UTC,"Not likely the best advice.. but to u/somethingratherothers  statement... you could spend the upfront price of 2 days disney, 2 days universal, and then take a 4 hour road trip south to SE Florida... and still end up spending less than the above-sugguested year passes... while it may be cheaper for you to buy the season passes for a 3 plus week visit... it is still a lot of money.. and then the rest of the year without being able to use them... I recently moved to delray beach FL, from NY, and the beaches down here are world class.. the lodging can be managed cheaply, and you are within a cheap drive to the Everglades (alligator attractions, air boat tours) and the Keya, (tropical paradise)"

Themepark,2z97ur,banksnld,3,Tue Mar 17 03:51:09 2015 UTC,"You're exactly right.  This is a passion project for all of us and our entire design team is funding the majority of the costs out of our own pockets!  It is an incredibly expensive undertaking and the $7,500 (along with the money from our previous Indiegogo campaign) will help tremendously to offset the costs.  More specifically, we will use Kickstarter funds to plus the experience with features that we otherwise may not be able to afford.  It's all about supporting us to make it happen!  Every dollar really does help."
Themepark,2z97ur,iliketowalk,4,Wed Mar 18 18:36:37 2015 UTC,"I've been keeping an eye on this for a while and I applaud them for the Kickstarter but the main reason why I didn't donate is because no matter what you choose, you only get 1 ticket.  If I was going to go play that game, I'd go with at least 1 friend, I wouldn't go alone.  What's that? My friend could then buy a ticket? Sure, but then so could I instead of using KS.  Either way, I hope this is successful. I'm really excited that something like this is coming to Orlando and I hope it's a hit."

Themepark,2z5c26,scottwalker88,2,Sun Mar 15 18:49:15 2015 UTC,We had a good experience at the Anahiem Fairfield Inn. Its a clean nice hotel in the Good Neighbor program. Its also across the street from the Disneyland complex so no problems with transportation.
Themepark,2z5c26,kaosfox,1 point,Sun Mar 15 21:02:06 2015 UTC,I'll look into it and see what's what. Thanks for the suggestion!
Themepark,2z5c26,JJKalai,1 point,Fri Mar 20 17:50:11 2015 UTC,Any hotel on the east side of the resort along Harbor blvd is within walking distance to the resort. It's not like Orlando where you need transportation to the parks since WDW is so big. Hotels like the Tropicana Inn and the Howard Johnson come to mind that are pretty much right in front of the resort. This way you won't have to pay for parking and you won't have to wait for a shuttle.
Themepark,2z2zd9,tideblue,2,Sun Mar 15 02:07:51 2015 UTC,"Reminds me of when Disney World did the ""Free on your Birthday"" deal. Good way to get free publicity about the park's 40th."

Themepark,2z1tt4,Tports42,4,Sat Mar 14 19:59:52 2015 UTC,"1: There are two Harry Potter areas, one in each of the parks (Universal Studios and Islands of Adventure)   Hogsmead located in Islands has 3 dedicated rides, Harry Potter and the Forbidden Journey (dark ride), Dragon Challenge (rollercoaster), and Flight of the Hippogriff (Family ride)  Diagon Alley has Harry Potter and the Escape from Gringotts (dark ride/roller coaster). It also has a lot more stores and performances than Hogsmeade. A lot of people say its more detailed and more to do than Hogsmead.   Both sections has the Hogwarts Express which links the two worlds. It requires a park hopper to use.  2: The Express Pass only works on select attractions, I believe none of the Harry Potter attractions use Express Pass. It will depend on your preference and budget which one to get. Also consider the time of year you are going. Some weeks are going to be busier than others. Check out: https://www.undercovertourist.com/orlando/crowd-calendar/ for the estimate crowds for your week. If its a light week then dont buy."

Themepark,2z1tt4,Goliath_TL,1 point,Sat Mar 14 22:41:10 2015 UTC,Dragon Challenge and Flight of the Hippogriff use the ExpressPass. The other two rides and the Hogwarts Express do not.
Themepark,2z1tt4,tdt0005,1 point,Wed Mar 18 04:00:17 2015 UTC,"I'd point out that Dragon Challenge and Hippogriff both existed before Harry Potter World and don't actually have anything to do with the book/movie franchise. They just happen to be there. No different than riding ""Batman: The Ride"" at Six Flags."
Themepark,2z1tt4,DarkSoldat,4,Wed Mar 25 01:25:48 2015 UTC,I went to Universal in 2012 and rode Harry Potter and the Forbidden Journey. I could not use my fast pass on the ride and the wait is about 45-60 min. The line is going through the Hogwarts Castle so it's pretty entertaining while you wait. Goes by quick.   I am going again in May of this year and the fast passes that I pre ordered still do not give you access to ANY Harry Potter ride. That includes The Hogwarts Express that goes from park to park.   The fast passes are still very much worth it for the rest of the rides. I suggest always buying it when visiting the park.

Themepark,2z1tt4,katiekinzakat,3,Sat Mar 14 22:41:26 2015 UTC,"Fast passes only work for certain rides. I will however suggest a few. The Mummy (Universal Studios). I HATE rollercoasters. But this indoor rollrcoaster is so theatrical I can't not like it. Its probably my favorite ride.   Next I would say Spiderman (Island of adventures). Its a strange ride to describe but you travel through differnt parts of the city, with 4d types things interacting with you.   Which brings me to: Transformers (Universal Studios). Pretty much Spiderman but....with Transformers. Also you can meet and greet with some outside the ride. The decepticons with talk trash on your clothes.   I've only ever been to Hogsmead, but the main Harry Potter ride in the castle is just fantastic! Of course Jurassic park (Island of Adventure), The Simpsons area (Universal Studios), and really most of both parks are all fun places to check out. Be sure to be at Universal Studios at night to see the light show. Enjoy your trip!"

Well, I got news for you- them rides are more tattered and out of date than a phone book in a hourly motel, and them fests are a distraction from the truth: it's like a wedding reception, there's nothing worth your dollars here and you were a sucker the moment you bought that ""magic"" band.

Themepark,2yu1j1,Erkel1273,3,Thu Mar 12 20:31:40 2015 UTC,"The SeaWorld in San Diego is the original SeaWorld so the ones that came after are quite a bit bigger. You can expect to see some of the same shows (like Blue Horizons and One Ocean) in both parks, but they might have slight differences due to having different sized and shaped stadiums.  The Sea Lion and Otter show is currently on hiatus due to the overwhelming number of sea lion pups being rescued off of San Diego beaches and the need to use the sea lion trainers for helping with the beached animals.  But the weekends this March are their Wild Days which is a cool new opportunity to see a unique Shamu show and possibly meet some exotic animals up close!  If you have questions about SeaWorld, just ask!!"

If you stick the phone in your front pocket you could lose it depending on how it fits. They don't like you having anything in your pocket at Mach Tower though. But you can just put it on the ground in front of you there. No one is going to come near it while you're up in the air. Another option is to spend a dollar at each ride to toss your phone in the locker.

I did it like every other tourist would do it: First the zoo part below, and after that in the lift up to the 'ride' part of the parc.  I enjoyed the dolphin show, but more for the views behind the theater (there is a fairly large heavy shipping lane), and it's nice to sit for a while: http://i.ytimg.com/vi/Xolecbl20lg/maxresdefault.jpg  And I really enjoyed the mine-coaster ride, but more again because of the cliff it is build on.  http://images.travelpod.com/tw_slides/ta00/bba/1ae/2-ocean-park-mine-train-hong-kong.jpg  https://c2.staticflickr.com/2/1287/1371906131_f927daa56c.jpg  http://images.travelpod.com/users/tyga/4.1257042603.mine-train-ocean-park-hong-kong.jpg  Great parc just to wander around.

Quality varies wildly and some chains (Disney, for instance) use an interactive version that wouldn't translate well to print, but for instance all of the Six Flags parks look pretty good.   Also keep your eye on eBay.

We arrived maybe 20 minutes early. We walked back to Diagon Alley and it was amazing walking through for the first time and seeing it so empty. It was really like we walked into the HP Universe. We rode the new ride with no wait, but it broke down for about 3-4 minutes while we were on it, so we got to ride it again!   The Hogwarts Express does not start running until the other park opens, so we still had about 30 minutes to kill. We walked back to the front of the park and did Minion Mayhem with no wait, and Rip Ride Rocket 2-3 times with no wait. Then back to Potter World to ride the train over to IOA where we rode Forbidden Journey once standby and then again with single rider. Then we did most of the big rides at IOA before taking the HE back to US where we finished out our day. We did pretty much all of the big attractions."

Themepark,2xgy0q,WHY-YOU-LITTLE,10,Sat Feb 28 16:20:25 2015 UTC,"The sequels better be good!  Personally I wish Disney would pour money into a Star Wars land and/or a Villains land, but so it goes."
Themepark,2xgy0q,theflatdog,6,Sat Feb 28 19:25:50 2015 UTC,"Yeah, if the sequels go bad, this will be embarrassing."
Themepark,2xgy0q,darthjoey91,3,Sat Feb 28 23:20:22 2015 UTC,"Villian's land? I'd want a Villian's park!  IIRC 80% of Disney's visitors are adults and with Universal adding a more adult experience and Disney appearing to make their newest rides aimed towards kids, there is so much potential there to do something."
Themepark,2xgy0q,scottwalker88,2,Wed Mar 4 20:30:29 2015 UTC,"I really wish Disney would understand that adults like the parks as well and cater a little more to them.  They have 4 parks, 1 can be adult oriented.  Losing Pleasure Island really stunk.  I'm still bitter all these years later!"
Themepark,2xgy0q,1upgamer,2,Thu Mar 5 13:32:10 2015 UTC,"I think Disney would probably say that EPCOT is their adult park especially when you can drink around the world but I think they fail to realise that adults want some adrenaline rushes too.  When I was younger, my parents used to love Pleasure Island but I'd raise hell to avoid it, it was the most boring place in the world for a kid and now I'm old enough to appreciate what it was, I feel awful for doing it."
Themepark,2xgy0q,scottwalker88,2,Thu Mar 5 16:10:31 2015 UTC,They are definitely pouring money into a Star Wars land. They had to halt production until they knew what to include from the new film.
Themepark,2xgy0q,MadeWithLego,7,Sun Mar 1 09:28:10 2015 UTC,"I hardly care about the Avatar aspect as much I do the new tech being brought in on this project. Replacing all the leaves on the tree of life with ones that light up, pressure sensitive floors, etc etc. I'm wondering how they are pulling off ""floating"" mountains."
Themepark,2xgy0q,Waitthisisntfacebook,3,Sun Mar 1 06:51:18 2015 UTC,This. Definitely this.

Themepark,2xgy0q,ProjectWheee,5,Sat Feb 28 21:56:50 2015 UTC,Oh god. You're right. It'll be the best place on property.
Themepark,2xgy0q,Touch-fuzzy,3,Sat Feb 28 22:02:53 2015 UTC,"They should build an Avatar Land in Washington, Oregon, Colorado, Alaska or DC.  Or just hurry up and legalize it end prohibition everywhere."
Themepark,2xgy0q,ZappyKins,3,Sun Mar 1 01:44:29 2015 UTC,I hope that thing in the first picture will be as big as the tree of life
Themepark,2xgy0q,AlwaysDankrupt,2,Sun Mar 1 01:45:18 2015 UTC,imagine what they could do if they put this much effort into a property they actually cared about.
Themepark,2xgy0q,VicariousFan,2,Mon Mar 2 04:35:08 2015 UTC,We know Star Wars is coming but they can't touch Marvel in WDW and they lost Harry Potter due to their stubbornness and it's rumoured they've also lost Lord of the Rings.

Themepark,2xeawz,thegreatinsulto,2,Thu Mar 5 13:41:44 2015 UTC,"Didn't Marvel used to be universal? Hence the hulk ride, spiderman ride, dr. dooms free fall..."
Themepark,2xeawz,MisterHowser,2,Sat Feb 28 01:58:13 2015 UTC,"Disney owns Marvel but Universal has the theme park rights for IIRC 500 miles around Universal Orlando.  The sad thing about this, is that Disney can't build any Marvel rides in Disney World or face getting sued and Universal need permission from Disney to expand Marvel Island, which Disney won't do.  It's made even sadder by all the recent success of Marvel with The Avengers and Guardians of the Galaxy. Although IIRC when the original deal was made, it was on a character by character basis and I think Guardians of the Galaxy was so far down on the list, that Universal didn't bother to include them on the contract so Disney may be able to do something with that .  When Iron Man 3 came out, they decorated one of the monorails. The train was allowed to travel around WDW but was banned from travelling into EPCOT. EPCOT also wanted to show Guardians of the Galaxy in the old Captain EO theatre with a 4d experience but Universal determined that would be a ride and the idea was scrapped."
Themepark,2xeawz,scottwalker88,1 point,Wed Mar 4 20:22:39 2015 UTC,They have the licensing rights.
Themepark,2xeawz,BlazingCondor,2,Sat Feb 28 06:33:01 2015 UTC,"I'm not a massive Lord of the Rings fan but I always thought it would make a great addition to Island of Adventure. If Universal ever decide to let Marvel head to Disney, I think this would be a great replacement."
Themepark,2x3v2v,reelbigfishtml,4,Wed Feb 25 12:56:57 2015 UTC,Do you have a video of both rides? I have never seen the Cowboy one.
Themepark,2x3v2v,AmberHeartsDisney,3,Wed Feb 25 17:32:50 2015 UTC,There's a cowboy one? I've gone on this ride more times that I can count and I've only ever seen the gangster version.

Themepark,2x23ri,monsterflake,1 point,Wed Feb 25 13:43:13 2015 UTC,"OP here. I think Animal Kingdom is my favourite but I struggle to convince my friends to want to go. I'd love to really slow down and explore the place like one would a non-theme park, but it just becomes about riding Everest and Dinosaur and getting out. I like zoos, I guess, but I just think Animal Kingdom's foliage especially is just... Outstanding. Just full on spectacle after spectacle of greatness, it's just lacking in definitive STUFF for people to do, which I fully appreciate a theme park should. It's a shame. I hope Avatar solves the problem but I worry it'll just contribute to destroying what's good about the park like Dinorama kinda sorta does."
Themepark,2x23ri,askewedview,2,Mon Mar 2 13:28:05 2015 UTC,"I never knew about the backstory of the land. This is a great idea but sadly I too was a guest who thought that Disney just ran out of money. It's a shame they didn't get to realize the full vision, as it goes with a lot of their ideas.   Great article OP"
Themepark,2x23ri,shockstreet,2,Wed Feb 25 22:57:45 2015 UTC,"When I first went to Animal Kingdom, Dinoland USA existed, but Chester and Hesters did not. I felt like it fit in a lot more this way, although it was a VERY small land at the time. When C&H came about, I absolutely HATED it.  Back then, backstory didn't really matter to me. These days, it's what I'm interested in the most. The story behind areas that isn't directly told, but rather implied. Now that that's the case, I love Chester and Hesters just because of its fantastic story. However, I do agree in that I think it doesn't make for a great area in a Disney Park, because most people either won't ""get it"", or won't care about it. I know this because I was one of them."
Themepark,2x23ri,Whambacon,0,Sun Mar 1 17:50:03 2015 UTC,"Absolutely wrong. This is my favorite area in all of WDW. It reminds me of my childhood when a family vacation was a road trip to nowhere, a day in tourist traps along the way. It reminds me of the old Stagecoach Stop/ Mystery Hill/mini golf gift shop full of velvet covered dinosaurs days. A much simpler time. Don't like the carnival games? Don't play them. I love the coaster in its pastel colors and old looking amber fluorescent lights above the line.   It's simple. Dinoland USA is a tribute to lost America."
Themepark,2x23ri,Whambacon,1 point,Sat Feb 28 13:28:04 2015 UTC,"Hello! Did you read the article? I pretty much agree with you wholeheartedly, but believe that it doesn't work due to the vast majority of guest perception that these kind of places portrayed are naff. I think, the irony is, outside of Disney paying Disney prices expecting Disney-like attractions, people would love Dinoland USA. If it were authentic, ya know? It being at Disney makes it misunderstood. At the end of the day, I question whats more important from a design perspective and learn towards providing something the masses can understand. Someone named Jeremy left a really good comment on the post that will interest you.  Thanks,"

Themepark,2x0aq4,bryan_rothwell,9,Tue Feb 24 23:32:35 2015 UTC,We all knew it was a King Kong ride but deep down I was secretly hoping for a Jurassic World ride. I don't really care for King Kong.

The goal here is to drive down total admissions into their park because they're providing a Six Flags day type of experience to their guests at the moment (IE: overcrowding). Until that day admission prices will continue to increase, well into the $1,000+ per day for a family."
Themepark,2wqdy6,EricGarbo,3,Sun Feb 22 05:42:46 2015 UTC,guess how much Disney Tokyo prices are?  $53   Just saying the best Disney park hasn't increased prices
Themepark,2wqdy6,VicariousFan,3,Mon Feb 23 14:21:40 2015 UTC,"Not being owned by Disney makes all the difference. TDL is a theme park run for its own sake, whereas the stateside parks are just one content distribution arm of a multimedia conglomerate."
Themepark,2wqdy6,broadwayguru,3,Mon Feb 23 21:17:48 2015 UTC,"while that is true and it explains why Tokyo Disney doesn't raise its price it doesn't explain why WDL raised its price.  Especially since Disneyland fought hard to not raise their prices.   WDW is only raising the prices because well they can its a shame that money isn't going back into the parks.   Sadly WDW upkeep is showing, with broken ride elements and other parts in desperate need of a new paint job.  Perfect example the Laughing Place scene in Splash Mountain has been broken for over 7 years."
Themepark,2wqdy6,VicariousFan,9,Mon Feb 23 21:30:55 2015 UTC,It sucks but the have absolutely no reason not to. The park is always packed to the max. Always.

Themepark,2wqdy6,VicariousFan,5,Mon Feb 23 21:31:38 2015 UTC,People will pay it so why not?   I'm wondering if it's partly an attempt to get people to stay at the resorts and take advantage of the package deals they offer which I'm assuming give a discount on park tickets.  I can't say I have much of a desire to go to the Disney parks but it's a shame how expensive it's gotten for those who do want to go.
Themepark,2wqdy6,Imaginos64,1 point,Sun Feb 22 17:39:19 2015 UTC,it would be nice if they put that money back into the parks.

The rest of us have found better places to go and cheaper things to do in this wonderful place called southern California.   EDIT: Just noticed the top level pass costs about $800. For that price, you could buy passes to Knotts, Universal, and Sea World, visit a few museums, go to a Broadway show at the Pantages...and still have enough left over to spend a couple days at DL."
Themepark,2wqdy6,broadwayguru,2,Sun Feb 22 05:47:21 2015 UTC,California residents don't get a discount season pass like in Florida? The resident pass is like 500 and I'm pretty sure for everyone else it's less than 800. I was thinking 750.

Do you think based on those interests we would be better off at disney for the 7th and swapping universal to friday? or it won't matter either way since its a weekend anyway?
Themepark,2wg1hj,amsterdaam,1 point,Thu Feb 19 17:52:54 2015 UTC,March 6th is listed as a slow day on orlandoinformer.com and they are pretty good at determining the crowd levels.  Saturday is listed as moderate.  Friday would be a better bet as us locals are at work and not using our annual passes.  I would recommend switching to Friday if possible.
Themepark,2wg1hj,amsterdaam,2,Thu Feb 19 17:57:09 2015 UTC,"Thanks! I just checked it out and compared it to the Disney crowd cal I am using, and that looks to be the best option. Thanks so much!  As a local with an annual pass, do you have any suggestions of things I should do at Universal that I wouldn't have thought of? I haven't been since 2010 when Hogwarts first opened and we really only experienced Potter stuff, and sorta skipped the rest at the Islands."

Themepark,2vkehg,RockemSockemCronuts,2,Wed Feb 11 19:20:36 2015 UTC,"I went in 2009 and it's very good indeed. The Aquatrax coaster is one of those rides where you come off questioning why there aren't more of them and the indoor section has a great array of rides squeezed into a small place. I don't think Disney has anything to worry about, the park is too small for that comparison. Think of it more as a well themed Mall of America."
Themepark,2vkehg,wykah,2,Thu Feb 12 07:21:38 2015 UTC,"I visited in 2011, follow the park, and I live in Orlando. Lotte World is not up to the show standards of WDW, which means that some of the animatronics might be broken, not as dramatic of a ride, a little bit less capital went into each project, etc. Also, they have some strange rules in operations and fastpasses and such that don't really jive well with what you may know. Make sure not to exit the park once you're inside, you will get screwed. And of course the big difference that they don't have the familiar character tie-ins (for me personally that matters much less).  However, their INCREDIBLE utilization of space, combined with having some Disney-Quality rides and some pure thrill rides puts it on par with Magic Kingdom for me in terms of fun. They have 10-15 dark attractions that could pass for a Disney ride (meaning somewhere between the level of detail of Peter Pan vs Level of Detail in Indy), and then you have things like the giant swinging ship, Atlantis Adventure, Super loop, French Revolution. They've also been adding about a ride and a half per year since the late aughts. They have really good parades too done by the Goddard Group.  Really amazing park, I preferred it over any WDW park and second to Europa Park for me overall.  This thread should help  The only other place I went to in Korea that was truly worthwhile was Everland, and only for T-Express and maybe the safaris. That park has very poor operations and is frequently crowded (and the small world ripoff was HEINOUS). Lotte World as a whole was way better and is far ahead of Mall of America."
Themepark,2vkehg,BlahBlahson23,1 point,Sat Feb 14 02:15:10 2015 UTC,I was there in 95. I understand things have changed quite dramatically since then. The indoor part was really cool.

Themepark,2vkg3x,Quellman,2,Wed Feb 11 19:32:45 2015 UTC,"If there was any remaining doubt that this DreamVision stuff is a load of crap, consider that in the presentation they made a specific point of stating that the Alabama Music Hall of Fame would be moved into the park, when in reality, they haven't even talked to the museum about this at all. The AMHoF literally just heard today about this supposed plan and have come out saying they're not having any part of it. How clueless can they be?   I mean, even apart from that, the presentation was pretty bad. I tuned in half-way, but one of the main presenters was just awful, like this was the first time he's spoken publicly.   This company is headquartered out of a stripmall, hasn't even made a single major movie yet (supposed to be the bulk of their business), and their financial partner that is supposed to be ponying up the $7+ billion for these parks was founded last week.   It's infuriating, and an embarrassment to the industry."

Weather was even pretty bad and the crowds were enough to make a reasonable wait. Like all parks, wait to see for yourself for Flash Pass. Unlike other parks you do not need the platinum version for specific rides at Fiesta Texas (unless the new Batman ride changes that). All the same, get there when the park opens and rush to the new Batman ride and/or Iron Rattler to get those done first before too many people arrive. I would guess Easter crowds will come in heavier after service/brunch."

The times I've been before, I've often thought about getting a flash pass, but have never needed it. Every time I've been able to get on everything I wanted to at least once. The last time I went was last June, and probably the best trip yet. We started at the big new ride (Full Throttle) which took about 15 minutes to queue for right after the park opened, and from where we went ANTI-clockwise around the park. The first three or four coasters after that we literally walked-on, sometimes riding twice or even three times without queueing. I'd assume queue times would be similar (if not shorter) in September.   Enjoy! :-)"

He had a press conference two years ahgo where he promised the same thing.  He and other Silanksas have opened a number of now defunct entertainment companies.  Currently his company reports earnings of about 300k per year.  They claim to be self funding 2 3.5 billion dollar theme parks.  They claim to be using 5,000 acres in Ft Worth (down from 10k last time) and 15k in Alabama... they don't own any land in either place currently.  Most telling though is the fact that the animated movie he has in the works is about his daughter.  The Broadway show he claims to have in the works is about... his daughter.  The live action film AND the children's television series he claims to have in the works are about..... guess.... his daughter.  He has spent the last decade traveling around to various mega churches and religious TV stations telling this story about how he had a vision of a little girl sitting in a bombed out basement waiting for him.  He then claims he had police sketch artists draw his vision and then he traveled all over Russia looking for her.   The few youtube videos he has up are about as snakeoil as you can possibly get.

Yet the company seems to be pretty legitimate and their site has a link to a press announcement in Muscle Shoals next week. I'm not holding my breath but I hope it's true. Disney World was almost build in Alabama. We have relatively decent weather from March-November.
Themepark,2ujurr,exoscoriae,5,Tue Feb 3 03:11:55 2015 UTC,"This is missing the fact that they are claiming to be building TWO themeparks.  One in Ft Worth and one in Alabama.  Each is supposed to cost 3.5 billion in private funds, with the Ft Worth one at 10,000 acres and the Alabama one at 14,000 acres.  I tend to wonder how they have stayed in business since 2002 considering I can't find a single thing they have actually released beyond two short animated movies that came out in the past year.  It is also worth noting that Rick Silanski, one of the brothers who founded the company, adopted a girl named Nadia from Russia in 2002.  her name apparently means hope, and upon adopting her he told his company they were changing their focus to ""hope"".  The full length movie they are currently working on, Anna, is actually based on the ""true"" story of his daughter. He also wants to develop a live action version of the movie AND a children's show called Anna and Friends.  Considering this is the ONLY announced character in development, we basically have a guy telling us that he wants to develop 2 themeparks at a total cost of 7 billion dollars based around his daughter.....  The part that confuses me most however is the fact that Ron Logan, from Disney, is involved.  Either he saw a quick way to make cash off an idiot, or he actually believes this an all work.  I guess we'll see next week when they have their Ft Worth press conferences on Monday and their Alabama conference on  Wednesday.  I can't help but feel this is all a bunch of baloney though."
Themepark,2ujurr,exoscoriae,3,Tue Feb 3 14:41:04 2015 UTC,It's certainly strange. The fact that Logan is involved is about the only thing the legitimized it for me. That and the fact that I just want it to be true since I live less than an hour away.
Themepark,2ujurr,exoscoriae,1 point,Tue Feb 3 14:46:11 2015 UTC,"Living in Dallas myself, I am about as far from a legitimate themepark as one can get.  6 Flags is a horrible horrible joke.  The idea of having something in Ft Worth as grand as what they describe in their press release (not the one linked here - their website had a press release last fall specifically about the Ft Worth location) is pretty stunning... but then I start thinking, just how great can it be without any recognizable characters?  I'm not saying I need Mickey mouse to have fun, but half the equation of a theme park (or more if you ask some) is the ""theme"".  And a theme built around something unrecognizeable is a hard sell.  Based on the graphic they are using for this Muscle Shoals park in Alabama and the word ""SoundScape"", I begin to wonder if they are trying to build a themepark around music - similar to the failed Hard Rock amusement park.  Then of course there is the question of where this 3.5 billion (let alone 7 billion) is coming from.  The only places with money like that around here are oil companies and mega churches.  One doesn't stand to gain anything by investing in this and the other is a poison dart."
Themepark,2ujurr,exoscoriae,1 point,Tue Feb 3 14:53:35 2015 UTC,"I think you underestimate your location. You live in a city with a fucking six flags. You've got 4 hours on me right there. I have to drive to Atlanta. 2 summers ago I actually drove to Dallas to visit that Six Flags because I liked it so much when I went there as a kid. Granted, it has gone down hill a good bit, but it is still probably the 4th best Six Flags in the country. I guess you're pretty far from either Disney park, but at least you can pick which one you go to without having the fly to the other end of the country."
Themepark,2ujurr,exoscoriae,2,Tue Feb 3 15:01:06 2015 UTC,"We don't go to Six Flags.  Tickets and parking cost just about as much as a day at Disney or Universal.    They charge locker rental fees on every ride now.  Did you buy the $20 refillable coke glass?  Well, now you have to pay a buck to put it in a locker before you ride.  EVERY SINGLE RIDE has $1 lockers.  Unless you carry absolutely nothing with you(impossible), or you have someone who doesn't ride, then you have to pay $1 per ride AFTER paying to get into the park and to park your car.  Then you have the $12 slice of pizza, the $16 basic cheeseburger, the $8 corn dog.  You have the ""new"" Texas Giant (because the old one was so bumpy it bruised you) that ejected a lady in it's first season and killed her. In the her defense she was huge and apparently didn't get the lap bar all the way down.  In Six Flags defense, most people at Universal and Disney are huge as well.  Six Flags is a gigantic waste of money.  It is dirty, run down, the employees are all minimum wage high school kids who don't give a F about you, and rides are constantly closed for maintenance.   We are talking about a company who sold 27 parks in the past 10 years and STILL went into bankruptcy.  Magic Mountain in California is the only six flags I have ever been to that I enjoyed.  So no, being within the vicinity of a Six Flag does not change a damn thing.  As far as not having to fly across the country - I'm in the dead center.  I DO have to fly across the country to get to either park.  I suppose the only place in the US that could be further from Universal/Disney is further up the middle of the country, like Chicago.  But I just checked flights, and it is only 1 extra hour to get there from Chicago versus Dallas/Ft. Worth.  If your in Alabama then you are much closer to Florida than I am."
Themepark,2ujurr,RealNotFake,2,Tue Feb 3 15:15:29 2015 UTC,"Wow...  Well first off, you are way wrong about the cost of admission. A season pass to Six Flags (which gets you into any Six Flags across the country) is only around 60 dollars. I usually end up getting one even if I don't know if I'm coming back to Atlanta or not because of how cheap it is. You can also get a season parking pass for around 10 dollars. One day at Disney is right at 100 dollars. parking is 17 dollars. A season pass is about 750.   And I agree that the Six Flags experience is awful and the locker thing is stupid, but I just don't buy those drinks and I don't carry anything with me. It's not impossible. What the hell do you need with you in Six Flags that won't fit in your pocket? Food at Disney is expensive too. Just leave the park around 1 or 2 and get something from McDonald's and come back.   I much prefer going to Disney over Six Flags, don't get me wrong. But Six Flags has it's merits, and is definitely worth the price of admission if you like thrill rides. That's something Disney just doesn't offer.   Oh, and I really liked the new Texas Giant. I miss the old one, but I remember it being very painful."
Themepark,2ujurr,c00lhwipluke,0,Tue Feb 3 15:27:40 2015 UTC,"I have google.  It is $104 for a season pass.  You can get it down to $80 IF you buy 4 at a time.  https://www.sixflags.com/overtexas/store/season-passes  That doesn't include season pass parking however.  As far as not using the lockers - you don't carry a wallet?  Because you can't have anything in your pockets if you want to ride the Titan.  Is Six Flags cheaper?  Yes.  Is it smaller?  Yes.  Is it run down? Yes.  When you work out the value in the number of rides versus the price of admission are they equal?  No.  I've been to Six Flags 6 times in my life.  The last time was only because we got to go on a company day and we were the only people in the park.  That was about the only time I enjoyed myself there.  At this point, we go to Disney or Universal every other year and we haven't been to six flags in 5 or 6 years.  If I was still a teenager then maybe I'd give a crap about the place.  But that is an amusement park, not a themepark.  There is a HUGE difference.  The whole point of the article was they were building a themepark, not an amusement park.  If you are going to throw themeparks into the mix, then you might as well count state fairs and shit too."
Themepark,2ujurr,Turtle_conspiracy,4,Tue Feb 3 18:42:08 2015 UTC,"No need to be so bitchy about it. It's 60 dollars for the one in Atlanta.  https://www.sixflags.com/overgeorgia/store/season-passes  And I assumed it would be the same at all of them since it is good for any six flags. Sorry... I never said Six Flags was as good as Disney or Universal. I MUCH prefer to go there. And any time I go to Six Flags I get mad and think about how awful it is compared to either place. But dollar for dollar it's not a bad value. Obviously it's not your thing, and that's ok. But comparing it to a state fair is ridiculous. You made the asinine claim that going to Six Flags costs as much as going to Disney. Which I have proved you very wrong. But congratulations on having google. It costs us roughly $800 per person to do a trip to Disney and that is without the expensive dinning plans or staying at one of the nicer hotels. Hardly comparable to 100 dollars for as many times as you want to go.   And on a less important note, they didn't make people empty their pockets on Titan when I was there. I've never paid for a locker at any Six Flags. I'd give you the benefit of the doubt since you live there and could have gone more recently than me, but you already admitted you don't go there."
Themepark,2ujurr,Turtle_conspiracy,-1,Tue Feb 3 19:44:24 2015 UTC,"Your the one going on about it being ""way off target"" and ""asinine"", so don't start preaching to me about being ""bitchy"".  The dumbest thing about this conversation is you actually tried to start some idiotic contest with me over who lives farther from a themepark, when the simple fact is you live in Georgia, which is right next to Florida.  You insinuated that you have to fly all the way to another coast, when I live dead center in the middle of the country.  Your knowledge of geography is pretty screwed up.  Beyond that, YOU are the one who brought Six Flags into the equation. THEN assumed they were all as cheap as the podunk one in Georgia. And in a bought of complete myopy, the entire reason you brought up Six Flasg was to complain that I lived closer to a themepark than you (even though it is clearly NOT a themepark) but in a turn of events, the georgia six flags is obviously not that far from you either.  As far as the state fair goes, the Texas State fair actually IS bigger than Georgia's six flags.  The midway actually has more rides as well - LMAO.  As far as $800 versus $100, that is just retarded Disney is 4 bloody theme parks, 4 deluxe resorts, like 8 regular resorts, and multiple value resorts. Orlando itself is within an hour of beaches, you have Universal 15 min. from Disney, and a whole host of other amentiies because it is a tourist town.  On top of that, you are trying to compare the price of taking your entire family to Disney to $100, which doesn't even cover the cost of TWO tickets to Six FLags Over Georgia (google it, General Admission for one person is $61.99).    At this point you don't even know what you are arguing about, you just know you are pissed about something and looking to try and make a point.  So you are cherry picking facts, making up admissions fees, and comparing apples to oranges all in an attempt to be right about one single thing, and that is complaining that I compared the cost of Disney to the cost of Six Flags.  Well get this buddy, the cost of a ticket to Six Flags is $70. Disney is $94.  Parking at 6 Flags is $25. At Disney it is $17.  Total cost now is $95 at 6 Flags vs $111 at Disney for a single person.  That's a $16 difference.  Still want to tell me how ""asinine"" it is to say it costs nearly the same?  Considering the value of Disney compared to 6 Flags, it is ludicrous that 6Flags costs anything even close to Disney.  BUT NONE OF IT MATTERS, Because I was fucking talking about theme parks, and SIX FLAGS ISN'T A BLOODY THEME PARK.  So shove it."

Themepark,2sntee,kathyell,4,Fri Jan 16 20:49:53 2015 UTC,"I've taken an SLR on almost every ride at WDW (with a couple of fairly obvious exceptions - Kali River Rapids at AK is a no for me as I have no waterproofing, I haven't used it at any of WDW's 3D-centric attractions, and I can't shoot anything meaningful in the level of darkness that Space Mountain and Rock'n'Roller Coaster provide). I'm sure you know that there is a no flash policy on dark rides and on any other ride where they ask you not to use flash or external video lighting. Additionally, there is a recorded message at the beginning of Carousel of Progress that asks guests not to take images or video of any kind, though I've seen a lot of people violate that.  The ""coasters"" at WDW like Big Thunder Mountain, Seven Dwarfs Mine Train, etc. are pretty tame. The only one with a loop is RNR at DHS, and it's too dark to shoot in there anyway. On the mini-coasters, I'd secure with a wrist strap or neck strap just for safety, but I've shot on all the mini-coasters with my DSLR without feeling that it was dangerous and there's no policy against it AFAIK.  At Universal, there are a lot of rides that don't allow any loose items at all (as other commenters have said.) You'll have to stow your camera and other loose articles for those rides in one of their (free) lockers or with a non-rider. This is really a LOT of Universal's rides, and most of the rides where you can bring loose articles with you are 3D-centric and there's not much to shoot unless you have some way to capture images in 3d. (That's just rides, though, there's a lot of fun stuff to shoot around the park when you're not on a ride.)  I've only been to Sea World a few times and I've never been to the FL Busch Gardens, but I've brought my DSLR to Sea World at least once. Again, you can't use it on rides that don't allow loose articles, and you can't use flash in dark attractions. The lockers there are pay to use lockers, as other commenters have pointed out. I assume the locker/loose articles policy is similar at Busch and Sea World, as they're owned by the same parent company.  I have seen MANY tripods (I know you didn't ask about tripods specifically, but a park that will let in tripods plainly doesn't have strict policies against camera equipment in general, so I use it as an example of that) and large camera bags, presumably with several lenses and other stuff at Universal and WDW, and I've never seen anyone get hassled (unless they use flash in a dark ride, and then they are sometimes-but not often enough-admonished by the ride attendants and additionally they have to contend with me sending 'stub your toe really hard getting out of the ride' vibes at them). I can't recall if I've seen tripods at Sea World, but I haven't been hassled for bringing DSLR/extra lenses there and I doubt it would be an issue at any of the three unless you made yourself a nuisance with it somehow.  I myself have brought upwards of three extra lenses and a camera body and a few accessories to all three, and I've carried a tripod into the Magic Kingdom at least once. (It is a drag to deal with, and I don't recommend it really unless you really want it for something specific like fireworks shots. It's hard to secure your camera on a tripod in the crowds; I've seen one camera get knocked over in the parade/fireworks crowds that was up on a tripod without its owners hands on it to steady it.)  tl;dr: If you pay attention to when you have to stow it for rides that don't allow loose articles and you don't use flash on dark rides, you should be fine."
Themepark,2sntee,Megosaurusrex,2,Sat Jan 17 01:23:49 2015 UTC,"Disney will let you take it on anything you're willing to. Lots of opportunities to use it, as I have used ours often. Be prepared with a cushioned bag you can place between your feet.   Other posters mentioned universals ""no loose article policy"". There will be 7 rides you have to use a free locker, no exceptions. 5 are coasters (3 intense, 2 tamer) one spins and one is an intense simulator. So, YMMV in terms of what you want to ride. There are 2 very wet water rides that provide lockers you pay for to protect your items. Otherwise they are allowed and some pretty neat stuff to photograph. Be sure to secure the locker! Nothing worse than coming back and finding you forgot to push the ""lock"" button. They'll tell you a million times, the parks are not responsible for lost or stolen property.   Busch gardens and sea world  are more of a pain. They have mandatory lockers, but you must pay for them using quarters. I've gotten attitude about making change for the lockers at shops nearby. However if you are willing to use these or sit out the coasters, these parks are your best bet for animal photography."

Themepark,2sntee,scottwalker88,1 point,Sat Jan 17 03:55:24 2015 UTC,"You'll be fine with a camera at every park. Universal have recently become quite strict about taking anything with you on board a roller coaster but they have lockers that are free next to all the rides. They're not free for the day, usually the time you get allocated is the ride queue time plus 30mins.  You may need to prepare yourself for when you're in an audience and every single person in front of you has their phone or tablet out taking pictures and you'll be capturing their screens. It's infuriating."
Themepark,2sntee,shinola,3,Sat Jan 17 14:31:29 2015 UTC,"You know, there's something ridiculous about that. People are watching their phones at a live event rather than watching the live event. What's the point of being there if you're not watching?"
Themepark,2sntee,scottwalker88,5,Sat Jan 17 15:31:06 2015 UTC,They're recording a video that they'll never watch again of an event that has probably already been filmed by somebody with a far superior camera from a better location and it's probably on YouTube.
Themepark,2sntee,Smithyincucf,0,Sat Jan 17 15:55:28 2015 UTC,"Most parks are ok with all cameras. I see SLRs at the parks all the time. You may have issues with a tripod but that may not be that big of a deal with all of the bloody selfie sticks now a days.   As far as rides, it will depend on the specific ride. At WDW almost all of the rides have a smallish pouch to hold things, or allow bags at your feet. Universal and Seaworld are different based on ride. The last time I rode the Hulk at IOA they required everything to be stored in a locker."

Themepark,2sntee,Ofreo,3,Fri Jan 16 20:50:30 2015 UTC,"Be aware though that at Universal the lockers are free for the duration of your wait in line.  But at SeaWorld and Busch Gardens, they are rather rude about you having to put it in a locker and it does cost money, I believe two dollars?  Don't hold me to that one.  When I'm out at the parks, I bring my camera to Disney and Universal but I leave it at home for the SeaWorld Parks and just use my phone (I have a really nice camera phone)  But then again, I am a local and have passes to all 3 chains so I frequent them all.    Bottom line, DSLR is fine, but you will have to pay for a locker at SeaWorld and Busch Gardens, unless you leave it with a non-rider."
Themepark,2sntee,Woirol,-1,Fri Jan 16 23:56:09 2015 UTC,"Last time I was there, Universal Studios lockers were free for 60 min while in line. Not so at Islands of Adventure. They were all pay. But that might not be true anymore."

Themepark,2sib0e,skwigger,1 point,Thu Jan 15 16:34:48 2015 UTC,Wet n Wild is not as clean but it has better rides than the Disney parks. Aquatics has the best rides and is the cleanest. They are the park that consistently fills to capacity on the hot days and that's for good reason.
Themepark,2sib0e,Goliath_TL,1 point,Thu Jan 15 19:46:08 2015 UTC,"I went to Aquatica a few months after it opened. I don't know if it's changed since then, but I was not impressed. I've never been to Wet N Wild.  Typhoon Lagoon is by far my favorite water park in Orlando. Great theming, a diverse selection of rides (Crush 'n' Gusher is my favorite), and there's a sweet shark reef. I'm typically more of an amusement park kind of guy, but I really like Typhoon Lagoon for some reason.  I've been to Blizzard Beach a handful of times but it never stuck with me. The park seemed really small to me, even though it has roughly the same amount of attractions as Typhoon Lagoon."

When I was a kid, Blizzard beach was the best by far but as I've got older, Typhoon Lagoon has completely won me over.  I still Like Wet n Wild and I was quite impressed after I returned to it after skipping it for a few years to see that the rides are great, it's a lot cleaner but it still lacks something that the Disney parks have."
Themepark,2sib0e,scottwalker88,3,Sat Jan 17 14:40:43 2015 UTC,"Local here. The General consensus that I've seen around here is that the votes are fairly evenly split between Blizzard Beach, Typhoon Lagoon, and Aquatica.   Basically anything but Wet 'n Wild."

Themepark,2sib0e,Thetruth1777,2,Thu Jan 15 18:20:17 2015 UTC,IMO I say Blizzard Beach overall. However Wet'n'Wild (not the cleanest) has the best water rides.

I haven't been to Typhoon Lagoon though.

Disney and Universal are apples and oranges.  Disney is superior at theming and Universal is superior at thrill rides.  Universal's theming has improved, but it's still not close to Disney.

Universal is not as immersive in it's theming.

Yeah.. this is the next generation of theme parks right here.  The IoA Harry Potter land is nice but its no where near Disney Qualtiy however Diagon Alley is just amazing.   There is a reason why there are 2 hour waits to even get into the area.  Something Disney has never had.

I've seen the POV video, I've followed construction from start to finish, as I said the theming for Harry Potter is a great improvement, but it doesn't compare to Epcot or Magic Kingdom."

Again i didn't say Gringotts wasn't 3-d I said that The Forbbiden Journey wasn't 3-D  Gringots does have you used 3-D glasses but it has more in common with the Mummy.   As you pointed out a small percentage of the rides only have 3-D.    You haven't been there so you can't say what it is actually like.  I thought it was just OK by seeing the pictures and videos as well but after i went there I saw that it was amazing.
Themepark,2sbsf2,NeoCoN7,1 point,Thu Jan 15 01:10:02 2015 UTC,"FYI even though Forbidden Journey doesn't require 3D glasses, the flight sections are meant to look 3D because they use a domed screen with forced perspective video to simulate the 3D/motion effect.

BTW in Forbidden journey you are not simulating movement the ride actually lifts you into the air and moves you.  Transformers and Spiderman simulate movement by use of 3d screens.

Mostly when we say ""3d ride"" we refer to stereoscopic with the glasses, but Forbidden Journey uses different technology to provide a sense of depth trickery, as I explained above. It's more complicated than just glasses or no glasses. I suggest you expand your definition. And no, Haunted Mansion is absolutely not a 3D ride, nor are the parts in Forbidden Journey when you are surrounded by real sets and props. I'm referring to the video domed screens only, which you would see if you re-read my post."

The Fifth Dimension was a big part of my childhood and I've spent a long time thinking how I could recreate the entire ride from the start of the queue to walking outside in VR so that people (me mainly) can experience it all over again. I'm starting to learn 3D development with a DK2 with this in mind.

Themepark,2r5vsn,Weasle0,1 point,Sat Jan 3 06:54:58 2015 UTC,"I think what really made them mad enough to go ahead with the suit is the fact that the SF policies changed, which kept him off rides that he has previously ridden. I mean look people, yes it's embarrassing to get turned away from riding a roller coaster because you're physically not able to, but those policies are in place for the safety of the riders. They're not just arbitrary. People need to stop taking it so personally and getting so defensive about it - would they rather take the risk of having something bad and potentially fatal happen? It's especially critical after the whole New Texas Giant incident, because it has been shown that improper body types CAN fly out of restraints during the ride."

However, I'm also in a wheelchair, and I understand that there are a couple very old rides in the park that I just cannot ride because of the way they were designed. The parks want people to ride, but when you think of tens of millions of roller coaster rides across the chain every year, even a .0001% chance event will happen to someone."

Safety is our number one priority and if you're missing more than one limb you cannot brace yourself properly upon sharp turns our sudden drops. I wish there was a way because it kills me to tell a kid they can't ride because of something out of their control as unfortunate as this, but there's no alternative"
Themepark,2r5vsn,rosarito19,5,Sat Jan 3 12:18:21 2015 UTC,"As an anonymous employee from an anonymous theme park I'd have to side with Six Flags. The health and safety regulations are set by the ride manufacturer and parks will sometimes implement further regulations and working practices based on previous breakdowns/accidents - usually to make evacuations safer and easier. If he'd been on the ride before and was then refused access, the ride staff can't continue to breach health and safety regulations even if they were breached in the past. I regularly have to explain this to parents whose children are too small for the ride but have been allowed on rides with the same height restriction in another area of the park.

Themepark,2r5vsn,Epcot92,-3,Sat Jan 3 16:04:38 2015 UTC,"Considering the teen has been on many of these rides before the new rules were brought in, I understand his point.

Themepark,2r5vsn,RoseOfDawn,5,Sat Jan 3 11:02:20 2015 UTC,"It could come from the lack of ability to fully brace himself. If you can't brace, you can't prevent injury from the dynamics of a ride.

The other rides made by other manufactures that are what a lot of people refer to as a 4D ride. Such as the coaster type you named are reffered to a 4D but really are something different. So in a sense people call most rides that run a track and spin the car independent of the track a 4D but S&S are the ones that call there design a 4D so they can call Batman the first free spin.   As stated before me It marketing."

It is also first drop tower to use 90-degree tilting seats (facing riders straight down). Riders experience about five seconds of free fall, reaching a speed of 60 miles per hour (97 km/h).

Themepark,2oc1u4,ceepeewhy,9,Fri Dec 5 04:33:21 2014 UTC,"I was working in Magic Kingdom and this child of probably around 9-10 was crying.  It was brutally hot out, and his face was so red from crying and heat that I could just see how miserable he was.  His father was screaming at him about how much money this vacation had cost to come there just for him to cry like a baby.  His mother got so flustered when he wouldn't stop crying that she went over to him and smacked him so hard across the face that his head flew back.  Another mother nearby rushed over and confronted the woman for hitting her child, and then the husbands started getting involved.  The husbands were pushing each other, and the women looked ready to go for the hair. It was going ugly fast.  So where I was working was near Mrs Potts ice cream. I got a cone and went to the boy and sat next to him.  As all of this chaos was going on, I asked him to hold the ice cream while I took the napkin and dried his eyes informing him that there was no crying allowed at Disney. I said he could have the ice cream if he stopped crying.  He nodded his head and was happy.  He was just hot and needed a break.  That was all.  The parents finally noticed that the child was placated and pretty much stopped hurling insults at one another..just a few parting ones over the shoulder, and it was over.   It may sound stupid, but ice cream saved the day.    I really wish, though, that people had more patience with their kids in a situation like that.  They aren't used to the heat here, and the long days so just schedule time for breaks and let them cool off and you'll find yourself less heated too."

Themepark,2oc1u4,glitzyjan,8,Fri Dec 5 19:26:44 2014 UTC,I was working Wild Thing at Valleyfair in Minnesota as the entrance person. A kid came up walking really funny. He was just over the 48inch cutoff but something seemed off. I looked at his shoes and his heels were above the shoe. I told him to stand with his feet on the floor. He said he was.   I asked him to take off his shoes and inside them there were little blocks of wood under his heels. The kid was only about 46 inches tall.  Parents risking their children's safety to ride a ride are literally the worst.
Themepark,2oc1u4,ajn0592,3,Fri Dec 5 16:53:54 2014 UTC,"Before I even tell this story, it's gonna sound like some hardcore bullshit. Hear me out yo.  I had a summer job over at Knott's Soak City in Buena Park, CA. It's a small water park across the street from Knott's Berry Farm.  I worked as a Park Attendant, with our daily tasks being to sweep the ground of debris, change out trash bins, and clean & maintain restrooms.  One day, my task was to empty/replace the trash bins of the front half of the park (it's that small). We have a little hut that sells pizza, aptly named Portside Pizza -- employees shorten it to Portside.  Anyway, we have an employee area back there which also house two dumpsters, where we go dump the trash bags we collect from our rover carts. As I'm back there, I hear a shout from beyond the wall from one of the security guards.  I'm just chilling in the back, tossing out trash bags and emptying my rover. Then, two of my co-workers swarm me and tell me ""dudeeee shit's going down!!"". Of course, my reaction is ""what the fuck is going on?""  We all kind of chill back there because shit is actually happening on the other side of the fence. Then we disperse after the storm calms.  I later found out that this 21-ish-year-old mother and her sisters were caught smoking weed. Like, out in the open. They were literally right across from First Aid, and not very far out of the sight of our Guest Services booth. It wasn't even subtle.  So basically this mother was with her kid too. Kid wasn't doing anything wrong AFAIK. However, the mother, her sisters, and her young son get escorted out of the park -- along with a nice 'ol year-ban from the property.  Some shitty parenting got served sweet justice that day."
Themepark,2oc1u4,ItsChadReddit,1 point,Fri Dec 5 06:03:16 2014 UTC,"I worked at a Six Flags for a good year and a half and one day I was operating a kiddie train and it was a REALLY slow day which actually made the ride very calming to watch  go around at 7mph. At one point I had two kids in line and their parties behind them. One was a quiet little African American girl who was very patient and waited for instruction and she was with her grandmother and her mother. Now I should mention that it was clear the grandmother had adopted because the mother of the girl was African American while the grandmother was white. The other child was a little Mexican boy who only spoke Spanish and was very excited to ride the train. He was with his mother and his aunt. When the time came for me to let them on, he rushed to the gate because he was so excited and ran in front of the girl. The grandmother immediately got mad and started yelling that the girl had wanted to sit in the front of the train and that he was cutting in line. Seeing as how there were two seats in the front anyway it didn't matter but as soon as he got in front of her she yelled ""NO"" at him really aggressively. The mother of the girl did try to calm her down by saying ""he won't understand you"" in a nice way (and not assumingly because the two women had been speaking Spanish the whole time) but the grandmother shrugged her off and said rudely ""it's the same in both languages"" naturally this set off the boy's mother who calmly but firmly told the lady not to speak to her son that way. At this point the grandmother retorted with ""I'm not being racist I have a black daughter look"" when NO ONE has claimed she was being racist to begin with. Finally I intervened and told her that her actions were out of line and if she harasses another guest that I would call security, which shut her up."

I think literally the only thing that's really been a major change in the ride is the alteration of the Footlight Parade segment at the opening of the ride.  Everything else is pretty much the same as I remember as a 12 year old.  Everything about the Hollywood Studios park is how I remember it as a 12 year old save for Star Tours, the Aerosmith coaster and a handful of other changes.  That park is more frozen in time than EPCOT, sadly.  I told my wife last year that they should abandon the Movie Studio concept and adopt some of their other properties into the park. I know Marvel's can't happen with Universal's park so close by, but seriously, they could do Star Wars Weekends year round, have a proper Muppet area, do a better Pixar set of attractions, maybe adopt some of their Disney Jr, Disney XD or Disney Channel attractions and stage shows instead of just keeping the park some giant museum of the 1990's era of Eisner.  Outside of riding Star Tours or a refreshed TGMR, I have no interest in going back there again, ever."

If they used similar ideas to develop something original, I'd be all for it. But it's like, in 10 or 20 years (or even less!), will people give a hoot about Avatar?

Themepark,2mu6mr,viridislament,7,Thu Nov 20 02:48:57 2014 UTC,"Best time to visit: early December, mid-week. You get the parks decorated for Christmas, and more often than not a lot of special entertainment (especially at SeaWorld, but not at Magic Kingdom due to the upcharge parties or Animal Kingdom which has nothing big for the holidays). Plus the weather is usually nicer than the Summer season, and typically less refurbs going on like in Jan-Feb. If you're looking for Haloween, the earlier the better. The first half of June isn't too bad (people wait until their kids are out of school, but don't go on vacation until July or August once they've realized that Summer is almost over). Late September isn't bad on weekdays, once school is back in session.  The worst time to visit: the first and last two weeks of the year. Just don't do it. You also want to avoid Spring Break, but keep in mind that's almost three months around March and April. Major holidays are out, too: Easter, Thanksgiving, Columbus Day, Presidents Day, Christmas, 4th of July, Labor Day... Forget those weekends altogether, and when there's a three-day holiday weekend, people tend to make it a week before or after (leading to ""why is it busy today, when it was slow yesterday"" syndrome)."

The coaster in the video is drastically different from the (earlier) renderings in the linked article. I don't know much about this project but if there was a virtual queue type of system and you could go do other things (arcade/drinking/etc.) before a short wait to get on the coaster that'd be awesome.

Captain EO, Stitch, O'Canada, Carousel of Progress*, Indy Speedway, Imagination, Monster's Inc. Laugh Floor, etc.  *Don't misunderstand me, I love Carousel of Progress, but it's so dated and poorly taken-care of. and I'm not sure if the modern attention span can take watching something so slow-paced without, say, checking your cell phone or dozing off. Also, a growing number of non-English-speaking guests should be taken into account (see also: Philharmagic), because 40 years ago there wasn't much of a South American or European demographic coming to the parks like there is today, so I'm not sure a wordy stage play is the right fit for the area.  I say, make a Blu-Ray tribute (with a high-quality recording of the show, historical documentaries, commentary, and what have you), and put something in that space that will do the Tomorrowland theme proud.

Themepark,2lxzzo,winterkl,2,Thu Nov 20 03:20:16 2014 UTC,"I guess we're now going to have Frozen World to compliment Harry Potter Studios Florida. On another theme park website the moderator really praises all of the Disney parks and a lot of these decisions, while at the same time jumping down on roller coaster parks for the claims they make about possibly surpassing these Disney parks.  The thing is, I don't have a lot of interest in going to movie and television  themed lands. I guess theme parks today are a way of living out your movie fantasies, which interests a lot of people but not me. Roller coaster parks like Cedar Point appeal to me more because I'm a roller coaster fan, whereas I'm not interested in an escape from reality park like Disney as much. I mean, I enjoy this hobby and I'll still go eventually, but at those prices it's going to be a while."
Themepark,2lxzzo,EricGarbo,3,Tue Nov 11 14:54:01 2014 UTC,"I don't get why people try to compare theme parks like Disney with coaster/general amusement parks like Cedar Point. They have two completely different main audiences. I would bet that most people visiting Disney at any given time would never ride even some of the smaller CP coasters (Or are children who aren't tall enough) while many people at CP would be bored with the tamer Disney experience. Amusement parks try to be well rounded and have something for everyone but you have to take each park for what it is. Just like it wouldn't be fair to complain about Disney lacking a giga coaster it isn't fair to bash CP for not having incredible theming. Personally I would MUCH rather CP put their money into thrill rides than scenery.   I can't get into the Disney thing but I respect that it's just not for me. I was never very into the movies or characters as a kid and I sure as hell don't get the appeal of something like Frozen as an adult. I don't go to parks for the shows, the restaurants, the theming, or the fairy tale aspect but others do and Disney does a great job of satisfying that crowd. I don't see myself going to a Disney park as an adult unless we got free tickets or went with friends who were into it. The price is just not worth it to someone whose interest in a park is based almost solely upon their roller coasters."
Themepark,2lxzzo,Imaginos64,1 point,Tue Nov 11 23:54:19 2014 UTC,"While I agree it is true you can not compare theme parks and amusement parks as they are different, I don't think you can generalise about who goes to these parks. I am an adult and have now been to all Disney parks recently and love them however I have also done many amusement parks around the world, with my favourite being SFMM and will ride every ride possible.  I think they offer different things and cant be compared, I appreciate what amusement parks do as I love the thrill rides the more the better, but I also am into the movies and love being able to ride rides that relate to that as well, such as at Disney and Universal parks."
Themepark,2lxzzo,traveler89,1 point,Wed Nov 12 00:53:08 2014 UTC,"I didn't mean to make it so black and white; I know there's tons of people who love thrill rides and are huge Disney fans too. There's absolutely over lap. I meant that generally Disney and Cedar Point are trying to appeal to different audiences, hence why CP tends to focus on extreme coasters and thrill rides while Disney focuses on family and movie attractions. Disney is so much its own thing that I don't think you can compare other parks to it. It seems like some enthusiasts want every park to be everything to everyone and that's just unrealistic."

It looks like it was possibly a Johnny Rockets. Although I can't find any maps that call it that. Although I found one I think from 2002, that called it ""Johnny's Burgers"". So was it originally a Jonny Rockets location, and the licensing deal fell through? Or was it built to be one, and never opened as such?"
Themepark,2lst6h,ErikkuTheFox,7,Sun Nov 9 22:20:01 2014 UTC,"Local Carowinds resident here. During the Paramount era our Juke Box Diner was known as Happy Days Diner. After the park (chain) transferred over to Cedar Fair they had to rename/retheme it due to licensing. Before the branding/conversion to Happy Days Diner the restaurant was themed to ""Stan Mikita's"" from the Wayne's World movie.  I would assume this applied to all former Paramount parks."
Themepark,2lst6h,wafflemonster,3,Sun Nov 9 22:35:58 2014 UTC,"Hmm my Google-Fu helped me to find that the KI restaurant was renamed ""Happy Days Diner"" in 2007.

Themepark,2lpg4n,WolfsterJ,2,Sat Nov 8 21:25:58 2014 UTC,"The ride is a lot of fun and very exhilarating, but it doesn't really feel complete. It doesn't really feel like it has a beginning-middle-end because it is pretty short and doesn't really give you a chance to catch your breath.  In comparing this to El Toro, which would be the closest comparison for me, El Toro wins out even if it is the more conventional of the two. The first drop coming off before the turn is completed, submerging riders in the wood structure after the halfway catch-your-breath point, the turn into the massive ejector hill, and the twisting finale just make it such a complete ride. Goliath felt more like a tasting of different elements following each other which, while fun, left something to be desired.  If the Bull didn't have that super killjoy trim leading to the hill over the drop, it'd be the clear winner in SFGAm. But I'd say it's a draw between those two."
Themepark,2lpg4n,Phatage,1 point,Sun Nov 9 02:13:35 2014 UTC,"I was lucky enough to be out by Chicago on a road trip a little over a week after Goliath opened. I also thought it was amazing. I wish it were a bit longer but they packed quite a bit into such a short ride. The zero g stall is of course incredible but I loved the dive loop as well. I love how there's almost a slight pause before the plunge.   Goliath is the only RMC I've ridden so far so I can't judge it against the others. My home park, SFNE, is getting Wicked Cyclone next year so I'm beyond excited to ride another one and have a local RMC.  Is the wait still 2 hours? I waited closer to three when I rode but I was there on a Saturday and like I said it was about a week after it opened. I only got to ride once unfortunately."

I didn't have a ton of time and Goliath took up most of it so I only got on Goliath, American Eagle, and Viper. Raging Bull was down when I was there. :( I can't wait to go back next year (We're planning on getting to IL a day earlier) and actually hit all the coasters."

Themepark,2ld4b6,scottwalker88,2,Wed Nov 5 23:12:19 2014 UTC,"There was, PortAventura in Spain was run by Universal from about '97-'04. From what I understand, there were a lot of issues with the place: not making enough revenue, inexperience in dealing with the local workforce, and problems with debt from construction. Woody Woodpecker was made the mascot, and there were a few Universal-like attractions, like the simulator Sea Odyssey and a walk-through show Temple of Fire (similar to Poseidon's Fury in Orlando), and even a Horror Nights-type event.  But ultimately I think it was too different from the other Universal parks at the time."
Themepark,2ld4b6,tideblue,1 point,Thu Nov 6 01:10:34 2014 UTC,They basically picked some of the worst parts of the Orlando parks and added it to an existing park.

Themepark,2ld3cv,peanutismint,7,Wed Nov 5 13:07:13 2014 UTC,"In an ideal, frictionless world, the train would be able to ascend to exactly equal to, but not higher than, the top of the lift hill. In this case, all of the energy starts as potential energy, is converted to kinetic as the train descends, then is converted back to potential energy as it ascends the other side.   In the real world, some of this energy is lost to friction as the train moves. Some of it is radiated away as sound (the whoosh you hear has to come from somewhere). Air resistance pushes against the train and people further slowing the train. Because of these factors, without the addition of extra energy (such as a mid course launcher) no hill can be taller than the original lift, and they will typically have to get progressively smaller as the circuit continues."
Themepark,2ld3cv,Phlake,2,Wed Nov 5 13:28:44 2014 UTC,"Thanks! I just wanted to hear it from someone else because I spent all day at a theme park and my coaster-addled brain somehow started to get confused. So you might say that the lift hill, as well as being one of the more exciting parts of the ride, is actually like a big 'charger' that gives the coaster car its potential energy that it can 'discharge' over the course of the rest of the track...."

Montu had 8 people in line for front row (no-brainer). Kumba had literally no one in line when we got on so we got to stay in our seats in the front row! (Seriously, it happened) Cheetah Hunt 20/30 minutes. Falcon's Fury 10 minutes.   Any questions just ask!"

Themepark,2kn212,scottwalker88,1 point,Wed Oct 29 14:01:39 2014 UTC,It really bugs me that universal is land locked and the land they can expand into has the i4 going right through it.  I'm sure we will see some creative solutions especially if the rumours about the water park are true.
Themepark,2kjdtt,69withak9,2,Tue Oct 28 04:12:16 2014 UTC,Ok that's good to know. So is it possible to sell or gift that 2nd pass to someone else later on?

Themepark,2kdlss,WalterBrickyard,14,Sun Oct 26 16:12:05 2014 UTC,BGT has the best collection of coasters down there.
Themepark,2kdlss,studiopzp,7,Sun Oct 26 16:40:27 2014 UTC,"Orlando doesn't have many great coasters. I might even say BGTampa has a better collection than the entirety of Orlando, and it's half zoo.   I'd say one day at SeaWorld Orlando and one day at BG."

Themepark,2kdlss,KnightKrawler,2,Sun Oct 26 20:17:30 2014 UTC,FunSpot on I-drive offers unlimited ride bands. Get one of those then go on your fav coasters over and over. They even have a wooden one which is pretty badass.
Themepark,2kdlss,Fordx4,4,Mon Oct 27 05:46:55 2014 UTC,"I would say 1 day at BGT, definitely the most amount of coasters.  1 day at Disney and 2 days at Universal parks."

Themepark,2kdlss,tdt0005,1 point,Sun Oct 26 20:43:04 2014 UTC,I think 2 hours at fun spot would be more than enough. It's never busy and is open late.

Themepark,2kdlss,MaFratelli,3,Mon Nov 3 19:45:48 2014 UTC,"This was a trip I did once:    Day one (afternoon/evening after driving): Sea World Day two: Universal Studios/Islands of Adventure Day three: Miami/Dania Beach Hurricane (you can ignore this...) Day four: All Disney parks Day five: Busch Gardens Tampa    I was able to do everything I wanted to do at all parks (even all four Disney parks!) including some re-rides.  Two caveats, though: It was in September and there was no one at any of the parks, and it was also before any of the Harry Potter stuff opened.    The Disney parks are tricky but possible.  I was at Animal Kingdom when the ropes dropped, did the safari, Everest, the wild mouse, and Dinosaur, then drove to Hollywood Studios.  Did Tower (twice), Rock n Roller Coaster, Toy Story, and the Great Movie Ride then drove to the TTC.  I rushed through the first two parks and was done by 2 PM because I wanted to maximize my time at Epcot (my favorite) and Magic Kingdom.  Took the monorail from TTC to Epcot then after several hours there rode it over to Magic Kingdom (which closes last) for the rest of the day.    I think could do one full Disney day with a park hopper, a full Busch Gardens Tampa day, then either two days at Universal or a day and a half at Universal with a half day at Sea World.  As someone else mentioned don't forget Fun Spot either as they might have the best coaster in Florida."
Themepark,2kdlss,johnnyhala,3,Mon Oct 27 02:44:16 2014 UTC,"I would simplify your choices and skip Disney entirely for three reasons: 1. You will have only 3 fastpasses and you are done with thrill rides without 1 hour waits. 2. You hate lines and at Disney on Thanksgiving week forget it. 3.  Disney has very few thrill rides to begin with.  For thrills here are the best options:   Busch Gardens Tampa -- by far the best option -- You have: Sheikra, a B&M drop coaster; Cheetah Hunt, an Intamin linear induction coaster; Montu, a B&M Inverted; Kumba, a big B&M basic steel coaster; Gwazi, a headbanger woodie, plus a wild mouse and the old school circle-loop Scorpion which is worth a ride; plus the new Falcon's Fury 330 ft. face-down drop tower. Islands of Adventure: Dueling Dragons, a double B&M inverted and Hulk, a B&M powered-launch headbanger (also some top-notch water rides and the two best dark rides in Orlando: Potter Forbidden Journey and Spiderman) Seaworld: Manta, a B&M flying coaster (best thrill ride in Orlando) and Kraken, an excellent B&M floorless.  (also Journey to Atlantis, a pretty solid water coaster) Universal Studios Orlando: Rip Ride Rocket (vertical lift coaster) and Mummy (excellent dark-ride coaster hybrid) plus Diagon Alley awesomeness and Transformers dark ride   I would do 2 days at Uni (stay onsite 1 night for 2 days of unlimited express pass), 1 day at BGT, and 1 day at Seaworld.  Also Seaworld will be running its Christmas overlay on the weekend which is, bar none, the best in Orlando.  Edit: fixed Manta's name thanks to johnnyhala for the catch."
Themepark,2kdlss,nukii,3,Mon Oct 27 15:34:10 2014 UTC,Montu is the BM invert at Busch Gardens.   Manta is the BM Flyer at Seaworld.

Themepark,2kdlss,nukii,2,Mon Oct 27 19:56:46 2014 UTC,"They closed one side and are letting it rot, which is dumb because the whole point is that it was a dueling coaster.  It's sad, just like its sad that Universal quit running the dragons simultaneously.  All that engineering for the fly-bys on both rides now going to waste."
Themepark,2k8onl,1upgamer,13,Fri Oct 24 22:53:04 2014 UTC,"Thank God. The Entire park was designed and built around the walk up to the Great Movie Ride. Hat is fine, but put it ANYWHERE else."
Themepark,2k8onl,neon,5,Fri Oct 24 23:52:13 2014 UTC,The park has possibly one of the worst layouts though. Virtually every ride is at a dead end.

Plus, it does seem odd that Disney, who's so closely had the hat as it's central marketing symbol for the entire park, would remove it.  I do wonder if it's simply be relocated..."
Themepark,2k8onl,GolfBall0921,3,Fri Oct 24 23:45:38 2014 UTC,I wonder if they will replace it.  If so with what?  May have something to do with the rebranding to Hollywood Adventure.

Themepark,2k8onl,Paimun,1 point,Sat Oct 25 05:45:58 2014 UTC,The prior market symbol for HS (when it was MGM) was the water tower.  So it is possible that they may make a third.

Themepark,2k7g6u,kyarnell,6,Fri Oct 24 17:33:28 2014 UTC,"Saying it's ""not appropriate"" or ""what you expect when you go to a theme park"" is misleading. This isn't Legoland, kiddies. You have to pay a separate ($70) entrance and are cleared out if you were at Universal for the daytime actvities.    If this stuff offends you (or your mom, or opportunist lawyers) then DON'T GO.  We are avid haunt fans in my family, and if haunts can get watered down and sanitized, what do we have left? Mickey's Spooky Land? Ugh.  You don't get to go to the R-rated movie with a 13 year old, then come out complaining that there were boobies and cursing and death. Same thing here.

Wow, the actress only called a group of thirteen year old girls ""whores.""   Well, that just makes it so much better.  I'm sorry, but this is on the performer - there's no way those girls could have been mistaken for adults; she really should have used some common sense and directed the remarks at the adult members of the audience."

Recently someone recommended Bonine (active ingredient Meclizine) to me and that was huge.  It lasts all day and doesn't make most people drowsy the way Dramamine (active ingredient Dimenhydrinate) does.  I'm not sure what reason there is to ever use Dimenhydrinate over Meclizine.  I was even able to do THIS which was unimaginable before.  OP may have already tried these things without any success, but if not I would give them a shot.

If I were afraid of him getting cursed at or exposed to racy themes, (along with the expected scares) - I WOULDN'T SEND HIM!  He's been to HHN, Knott's Scary Farm and Fright Fest, and even worked at a friend's home haunt in Hollywood last year.  If the easily offended continue to force the whole world into the bubble they keep their delicate flower in, the world will become a bland, uncreative wasteland. (RIP Bill and Ted.) These girls were not held hostage, they could have flipped the performer off and shouted fuck off, and probably would have been applauded. When in Rome...  How can these people even try and claim that these girls reputations are being questioned? It's an anonymous crowd, not a classroom or church group!  When my son dresses like Brad and goes to the Rocky Horror Picture Show, I don't get offended when someone says, ""Oh, look at the little asshole!"" It's just words, and in good fun.

Stupid universal! You should babysit my kids better!   3) They had the option of walking away. It's easy enough for this show. Instead they just stood there. I'm willing to bet some of the feelings that they're showing are just because this is such a big deal now. They were probably laughing in the moment.   4) Universal could have avoided a big problem by apologizing from the start. Instead they ignored the parents. They are in the wrong there. I am currently being ignored by a company who promised me something and it is some annoying, unprofessional crap. An apology and free tickets could have made this go away."

Themepark,2jwh8w,monsterbucket,7,Tue Oct 21 16:40:09 2014 UTC,"You do get a VIP pass that allows you to skip the lines when staying in the expensive hotels on site.  Unsure of the limitations, and it may not apply to the newest rides.   Given that you can skip lines, you could probably do all the good rides in at least one park in 5 hours, but you will be rushed.  Dragon Challenge is the same ride if you've been on Dueling Dragons.  They didn't even modify the trains, so it's really just a new line.  Forbidden Journey is a very cool ride (as long as you like motion rides) and definitely worth getting on.    I haven't ridden Gringotts yet, but the consensus seems to be that it's less impressive.    Hogsmeade is very cool, as is Diagon Alley.  If you like theming, definitely worth checking out.  Butterbeer is delicious in both forms (frozen or soda), would recommend trying at least one.  I can't tell you if it's worth it, since park admission is expensive.  But with the VIP pass, you could possibly do a lot in a short amount of time.  If you don't mind me asking, why are you paying to stay on site at Universal and not planning to spend a couple days in the parks?"
Themepark,2jwh8w,nukii,3,Tue Oct 21 17:20:07 2014 UTC,"I've been on the original ride that was in the Harry Potter area, I think that's the Forbidden Journey one - and yes, that was pretty amazing.   From what I gather there's some of the Harry Potter stuff in each park, right? If I could only do one park, knowing that I've already ridden Forbidden Journey, which park should I do?  And to answer your question - I'm staying down at that hotel for a conference, so I'm tied up Monday through Thursday, but I can get out there on Friday."
Themepark,2jwh8w,nukii,2,Tue Oct 21 19:16:57 2014 UTC,"Yes, the rides are split between the parks.  Islands has Hogsmeade village, Dragon Challenge, and Forbidden Journey.  Studios has Diagon Alley and the Gringotts ride.  There's also a train ""ride"" that goes between the two, but you need to have a park hopper to ride that.  If all you care about is Harry Potter, and you've already been to Islands of Adventure (sounds like you have), then it makes more sense to go to Universal Studios.  That's the new Harry Potter area.  But be warned, the lines for things there can be VERY long.  Gringotts was 2 hrs and the line for ice cream was 30 min last time I was there.  And I looked it up, the hotel key line skip doesn't apply to any of the Harry Potter rides."
Themepark,2jwh8w,nukii,2,Tue Oct 21 19:26:15 2014 UTC,"thanks for the update! I think the studios ticket might be my best bet as I've done most all the rides at IoA, but have never ridden the mummy ride or transformers, and I think they're both at the Studios park. Bummer about the hotel key line thing not letting me into the Potter ride, but I understand I can get in an hour before the park opens, so maybe I just rush over there first thing?"
Themepark,2jwh8w,trisaratops1,4,Tue Oct 21 19:35:50 2014 UTC,"Yeah, heading to Gringotts first is your best bet.  The Mummy is a fantastic ride.  One of my favorite dark rides, actually.  Have fun."
Themepark,2jwh8w,FerociousGooch,1 point,Tue Oct 21 19:39:03 2014 UTC,"I agree--I would go to Universal Studios if you've already done FJ. Gringotts is cool and the whole building inside is a must-see. I went last month on a Friday and at about 10am or so the line was only 30 minutes. So it's not too bad on a weekday. I went last Saturday and it was way longer, 60 minutes I think, but we did single rider and it was super quick (10 mins?). The only downside is you don't get to see the inside of the bank as much from the single rider line. The Rockit is an awesome coaster and the express pass should help a lot with that. I like all the rides at that park except Twister, Disaster, and the kiddie stuff! Also if you like doughnuts I recommend the big pink one in the Simpsons area."

Never got close to a perfect score but I got 800,000ish a couple times. My problem is always with hitting the car opposite you when you are lined up against each other. I can never hit it right.   When I went back for the first time in 10 years I could barely get above 500,000. Then I did some research online and found out they modified the scoring which made me feel a little better."

Each time you hit the same alien your score stacks, so if you hit it 5 times and its worth 10 point then you'll get 150 points. And for the exhaust ports if you are on the left track then you can just hold down the trigger and since you move at the same speed it will hit it a bunch of times. Or you can shoot this pair of small eyes on one of the walls and it gives you a bunch of points."

It had Frank the Pug near a newspaper stand and every tutorial I've read said he is worth major points. As for the exhaust ports, I meant where exactly to aim on them because mine never seem to register, at least consistently and our car ends up spinning instead. Why does being on the left track matter? I've only ever heart to shoot at the EP because if you don't then you'll get spun and can't hit anything else."

I never saw Frank so I don't know about that. And you aim at the one circle above the car. If your port gets hit then you spin. But after one point the stop spinning and can hit it 4-6 times. And left doesn't really matter it's just what I always was on.

And that you haven't heard of a lot of the stuff I'm talking about. I've only been twice, and the time I played so much was over 10 years ago. Where are the eyes on the walls you are talking about? I did read something today I'd never heard of that said instead of hitting the EP you should look up above you and there are aliens directly above you to shoot that most people don't know about. Is that it?"

Themepark,2jwh8w,tdt0005,2,Thu Oct 23 04:51:34 2014 UTC,"Men In Black is still my favorite attraction at the studios park (though the last time I was there, Transformers was two weeks away from opening, the Simpsons Fast Food Blvd. wasn't open yet, and Diagon Alley was under construction -- all subject to change on my next visit I guess.)  I'm also probably in the minority, but I really like Hollywood Rip Ride Rockit -- especially with the secret songs."
Themepark,2jwh8w,fallingsteve,2,Wed Oct 22 14:15:37 2014 UTC,Why don't people like RRR? I thought it was great. I had a little trouble getting the secret songs to work but once on the ride I didn't really care. Lines were pretty short too! Single Rider line didn't even really save any time.

Themepark,2jwh8w,RyenDeckard,1 point,Tue Oct 21 18:30:53 2014 UTC,"Go to Universal Studios, ride Transformers, Gringotts, Men in Black, and Mummy. If you have more time, Simpsons is well worth it too. ET depending on how much you liked ET, as the attraction has aged poorly.  Avoid Disaster, Twister, T2, and Shrek 3d. Twister, T2, and Disaster I enjoy, but they all take up a decent chunk of time that you can't really afford. If you can go on any of these, go on Twister, as that attraction is rumored to be closing soon."

The entire land is filled with mini attractions and nothing feels like an afterthought.  Personally, my suggestion (this is under the assumption that you get an express pass or stay on site and get one included) would be Transformers, Mummy, Men in Black, Diagon Alley/Gringotts.   Most importantly though, do whatever you want to do!"

We were there for 8 hours and only got 4 rides in. I got the fast pass in August and I could not have been happier - 12 or 13 rides in 5 hours. I wish I could have stayed longer because I would've gotten so much more out of it, but had to leave suddenly because my aunt's back was hurting her. Have a wonderful time!"

Themepark,2jn65y,tdt0005,1 point,Sat Oct 18 23:04:48 2014 UTC,"How many people buy them? Does that not make the regular line go really slow, or is it expensive enough to prevent that? I've never been a time where I couldn't ride just about everything except Dragster in under 30 minutes."
Themepark,2jn65y,RealNotFake,1 point,Sat Oct 18 23:10:41 2014 UTC,"It does make the regular lines go significantly slower, but if you are going to CP and want to get all/most of the coasters ridden in a day it's pretty much a necessity."
Themepark,2jn65y,tdt0005,-1,Tue Oct 21 06:08:46 2014 UTC,I feel like that's a pretty shitty thing to do. Do they give them to you for free/cheaper if you stay on site?
Themepark,2jn65y,RealNotFake,1 point,Tue Oct 21 12:49:52 2014 UTC,"It's basic supply and demand. There are people willing to pay for it because otherwise you would be stuck waiting in 1,2,3 hr lines all day. And it's a good source of revenue for the park that they can reinvest later."
Themepark,2jn65y,tdt0005,-2,Tue Oct 21 13:03:06 2014 UTC,"it's not really fair to the people that can't afford it. I can afford it, but I can't justify it. I never had any problems riding all the rides in a single day before. This makes it sound like I will now. It won't be a great source of income when it starts discouraging lots of people from even bothering to come at all because they can't do anything."
Themepark,2jn65y,RealNotFake,3,Tue Oct 21 13:15:16 2014 UTC,"it's not really fair to the people that can't afford it.   No, it's perfectly fair. That's the capitalist society we live in. Those passes are usually not cheap so you can either save money or you can decide what your time is worth to you and potentially buy a pass. An amusement park is a business designed to make money first and foremost. Fast lane/flash pass/etc. is a good money maker for parks so it makes perfect sense. Cedar Point has so many roller coasters that if fast lane didn't exist you would have to spend 2 days to ride everything on a busy weekend, and fast lane is a good solution for people who want to pony up the dough. FYI people have made these arguments ad nauseum for years now and it's not stopping the parks - clearly the fast pass option is a lucrative business model that is here to stay. Your options pretty much are these:   1) Go to a park on a non-busy day, preferably during the week in a less busy part of the season 2) Expect not to be able to ride every single coaster you want in a single day 3) Buy fast lane and likely have enough time to hit all the coasters you want in a day  Without fast lane the difference in line waits wouldn't be crazy different, and you would still have to wait hours for some attractions. It's not like fast lane is clogging up the system to the point where you are waiting 2x as long, there are still going to be long waits for the major attractions either way. The perceived effect of FL on each attraction varies day to day and ride to ride. Anyway, they only sell a limited number of FL passes each day because otherwise everyone would buy one and that would totally negate the advantage. FL at least gives you a fighting chance if you are making a trip from a long way away and only have limited time in the park."
Themepark,2jn65y,TheGullibleParrot,3,Tue Oct 21 16:15:00 2014 UTC,A lot of people diss the Fast Pass but it's perfect if you have a lot of rides on your list and you have a limited time/the park is really crowded.
Themepark,2jn65y,yzerman2010,1 point,Sun Oct 19 00:34:42 2014 UTC,I was there yesterday on Sunday the 19th.  We had 5-6 hours to play and so we got the regular fast pass.  Road almost all coasters except Maverick and the Dragster (broke down and was down for a hour).  We got to ride the Mantis one last time.  We even got in the regular line for Gatekeeper and made it on in 10 minutes which was amazing.
Themepark,2jn0v4,peanutismint,1 point,Sat Oct 18 21:26:06 2014 UTC,"I found that last year, the last day of the season was the quietest as they had two trains operating on all the coasters, as opposed to the second from last day when they were all operating one train. So the 2nd of November is probably the best bet.  Hope this helps :)"
Themepark,2jn0v4,dedmetal98,1 point,Sun Oct 19 19:23:02 2014 UTC,"Hmm interesting... Any idea why they were running two trains even though it was likely to be quiet? One last run before the winter or what?  Also is it possible they'll have 'scaled down' ready for shutdown by stopping certain rides operating? I only ask because having visited Alton Towers in their final weeks in the past, they sometimes seem to have more rides not running towards the end... I don't know why, but I'd imagine if there was a mechanical failure that close to the end of season it wouldn't make financial sense to call the mechanics out to only have it run for another 4 days or so..."

You have to buy a maze pass to get into the mazes(scare zones are free) I think the passes are $15.  I would go on a Friday or a Sunday(way less busy, last Friday we had ~1500 people come through Saturday  over 3k) I would try to get to all the mazes but if you have to skip some I would skip Garden of darkness, total darkness, and chupacabra.

I'm in vault and we usually open at 6:30ish so that might help you get to other mazes before the crowds do."

Themepark,2jbhhv,mookieananas,3,Tue Oct 21 07:21:00 2014 UTC,"The best part of the Efteling theming is, that the first designer demanded that only natural and real products should be used for the buildings and theming. So in the fairytale forest all houses are build with real bricks and wood (they even used straw for the roofs).  In other words, it's illegal to use plastic to create rocks in the Efteling. You wants rocks? Use real rocks, or create them with concrete."

Once you've hit those head back towards Bigfoot Rapids and do Pinnochio, the line for that one gets really really long. Once that's over go next door to Forevermore.   At this point you'll only have one maze left and thats Black Magic next to Xcelerator. Doing all of those in that order should have you done with everything extremely quickly.

Themepark,2j1p7w,austinstudios,5,Mon Oct 13 05:08:30 2014 UTC,My tips would be:   Don't ride the rides. Trust me you can do that all year long. The reason you go to Knott's Scary farm is for mazes so focus on those. Maze lines will look long. However don't be discouraged by this because lines move super fast. Most lines will probably be about 20 minutes long. People usually leave a bit early so if you stay until the very end (maybe 5 or ten minutes before closing) there will be no lines. You can knock out a lot of mazes this way. The only downside is the cast members are kinda tired.  Be sure to watch the Hanging. This show is hilarious and makes fun of pop culture from the past year. But be warned if you are easily offended then maybe you should skip this show (think south park humor with a bit less cursing). Don't try to hide your fear. Even if you are not scared pretend that you are. Monsters tend to focus on the people who are scared more than people who are not. This also works the other way as well. If you are scared don't start screaming at everything because that only makes the workers chase you more.    Other than that have fun! Knott's scary farm is super fun!
Themepark,2j1p7w,aboyne42,3,Mon Oct 13 00:57:16 2014 UTC,"Some of the roller coaster lines were huge! Which sucked for me, since I am not from California and will probably never be back to Knott's. We got the fast lane, thinking if we got through the mazes a bit faster we would have time for some rides, and we thought the lines for rides would be short for the reason you said.  I waited over an hour to get on to the wooden coaster, and that was the only ride I ended up doing. Either way, we still had fun and enjoyed the mazes.   Have a good time out there OP!"

Themepark,2is8su,nukii,1 point,Fri Oct 10 15:52:03 2014 UTC,"From what I understand of their drawings its a slightly modified version of normal hydraulics, in that instead of having 1 cylinder per axis of movement with 2 one way valves, this uses 2 two way valves in which pressure is relieved on one as the other is stressed.  Not a huge difference but I think they are really trying to show off the rolling valves and the ability of the system to handle stresses more than anything."
Themepark,2iog1v,scottwalker88,28,Wed Oct 8 17:34:51 2014 UTC,I want to see them update the three parks that aren't worth the ticket price first (not MK). Hollywood Studios is half-way to a thrill park already.
Themepark,2iog1v,tideblue,9,Wed Oct 8 18:08:25 2014 UTC,"Absolutely this, though I'd disagree with only MK being worth it, I think Epcot is very much worth it. Hollywood Studios is close, and with everyhing they're supposedly adding/changing they're getting there. Animal Kingdom needs a lot of work IMO. When I went last year I went with my girlfriend there only for a few hours and then went elsewhere. My family skipped it altogether."
Themepark,2iog1v,Ditcka,5,Wed Oct 8 18:31:05 2014 UTC,"Epcot is still a great park, but the place has more restaurants than major rides right now, and that's a problem. It used to be my favorite park when I was growing up, but now Future World is filled with outdated and questionable attractions (EO, Figment, Ellen, Innoventions). Test Track and Soarin are the only things guests seem to care about at the front of the park, or will at least wait in line for.  World Showcase has more restaurants than attractions! I understand a mix of quick service and full dining, but does Morocco need three of them? Meanwhile, China, Canada, and France get by with outdated films (Impressions de France is an '82 original!). Even sidestepping Malestrom, which has been beaten to death, there's not much of value in the back of the park. At least with the New Fantasyland expansion, they added new rides and refreshed a few areas. Epcot is just getting left behind. And as I typed above, that's coming from an early 90's kid who loved the place.  Edit: I actually love Impressions de France, and see it once a year (Orlando local for 4 years running). But it's France as seen in the early 80's, and since the film has been playing for more than 30 years, it's the longest-running film attraction at any Disney park."
Themepark,2iog1v,tideblue,4,Wed Oct 8 23:05:57 2014 UTC,"As soon as you stop expecting Epcot to have rides, it becomes a lot of fun. It's more of a ... cultural experience I guess? When I was a kid / teen, I HATED Epcot. As an adult, I love it.   Animal Kingdom was similar. As an adult it's pretty awesome.   I guess my point is parks don't need tons of rides to be fun. It's just a different kind of fun."

Themepark,2iog1v,fermenter85,3,Wed Oct 8 22:04:04 2014 UTC,"The wildlife walks are awesome and a minimum hour each if you care about animals at all. Other animal exhibits add up to an hour or more. That's half a day basically, add in the stage show, Kali, Everest, Kilimanjaro, DarkDarkDinosaurDarkDark, and some wandering to smaller attractions (I think Chester and Hesters needs to die but it's still fun), and you're at 8-10 hours easily.   It's not a park I need to visit multiple times per trip like Epcot or MK, but I spend more time there than Hollywood by far."
Themepark,2iog1v,ugdr6424,2,Thu Oct 9 03:17:33 2014 UTC,"Just a matter of a difference in taste, then.  I spend multiple days at Hollywood Studios.  I love the TZToT, Aerosmith RnR, and Toy Story Mania and could ride them endlessly.  Star tours is a must do.for me as well.  I like to spend an hour att a time just sitting along Sunset Boulevard and people watching because I love the nostalgic ambiance.  The design and music are my favorite.  I make several trips to the SciFi dine-in theater each trip as well.  Muppets 3d I'll see once or twice. Sure, the Cars stunt show is somewhat meh after the first viewing and now that the back lot is closed... and Indiana Jones... the park is going to be about a half-day for the average guest.  Lots of room to improve going forward."
Themepark,2iog1v,fermenter85,2,Thu Oct 9 12:07:49 2014 UTC,"I love ToT as well. RnRC is fun, if only to continue to be impressed that Disney keeps a Vekoma Spaghetti Bowl running so smoothly. Star Tours is great. But five laps on Tower plus the other two is half day at best."
Themepark,2iog1v,phrogxix,3,Thu Oct 9 13:41:50 2014 UTC,"You must be kidding me, Finding Nemo and Lion King are amazing shows, the jungle trek is great, I really like Dinosaur, my kids love Dinoland, they have one of the most unique and entertaining parades outside of MK... flights of wonder is entertaining and the atmosphere on the whole is just great and fun to explore. I love AK."
Themepark,2iog1v,ugdr6424,2,Thu Oct 9 14:48:36 2014 UTC,"Just because I have different tastes doesn't mean either of us are wrong.  I disliked both shows.  Jungle Trek is good.  Dinosaur is alright but I can't ride it more than twice in a trip.  And, I just don't care for parades, in general, but I'll watch Spectromagic from the queues.  I have never done flights of wonder.  I'll make it a point to do so on the next trip just for you.  :)  I guess, overall, I still look at AK as a glorified zoo despite their rebranding and greeting in Harambe as ""NOTAZOO!"".  I remember going there the first month AK opened... back when animals were dying left, right, backward, and forward.  That's always in the back of my mind.  Sure, they've greatly improved in a lot of aspects but... I guess I'll have to wait until the new Avatar night show is ready before I'll be impressed."
Themepark,2iog1v,phrogxix,2,Thu Oct 9 15:08:58 2014 UTC,"Sorry, didn't mean to come off particularly strongly. I really enjoy the place, and I see it slagged a lot online and it never matches with the way I feel when I'm there. If you didn't like the shows, I can certainly understand feeling underwhelmed at the park, as they are two of the really big draws for me. Flights of Wonder is a bird show. If you don't like the much more involved big productions there, I don't know if you'll like it.   I think Avatar will add a much needed draw and spectacle for a lot of people. I'm actually fine with it, looking forward to it, and planning a trip for when it's opened. I know a lot of people are not or are doubting it.   Again, I didn't really mean to discount or belittle your opinion or tastes, I can totally understand the place not being for everyone. Sorry if you felt that way. Heck, there are people who love Hollywood Studios and I find that place inferior to Six Flags in most respects, save for a few attractions."
Themepark,2iog1v,ugdr6424,2,Thu Oct 9 15:20:03 2014 UTC,"No need to apologize, but the sentiment is appreciated.  MGM, or Hollywood, studios has always been a half-day park.  Even from opening day.  I think it had/has the most potential, given its over-arching theme of ""the movies"".  However, it's built on such a teeny tiny piece of land!  I know there's talks of expanding, possibly with a Star Wars land.  I'm not that huge of a SW fan but it's about damn time they starting doing something with that park.  To me, ToT is everything but even I can only ride it so many times in a day before getting sick of it and not really wanting to go on it again for tge rest of my stay.  Loooove the SciFi dine-in theater and could eat and drink there a couple times a stay."
Themepark,2iog1v,skwigger,5,Thu Oct 9 15:38:39 2014 UTC,"I think Disney plan on finishing updating the Magic Kingdom with the new central hub, then updating Hollywood Studios with Star Wars land possibly an extension of Pixar land and adding Avatar land to Animal Kingdom (Although nobody seems remotely excited about it) within the next 5 years to get the parks up to scratch.   After that they're counting down to 2021 to celebrate their 50th anniversary and I think that will be the time to add a 5th park.   I completely agree though, Universal have added more big rides to their 2 parks than Disney have to their 4. I go almost every year to Orlando and I think it's difficult to justify paying to go back to Disney 2 years in a row."
Themepark,2iog1v,phrogxix,2,Wed Oct 8 19:39:01 2014 UTC,Animal Kingdom is awesome. I could spend all day on the safari and jungle trek.

It's the only Disney property I've ever felt totally underwhelmed by and left before closing just because I was out of things worth doing and figured I'd have more fun eating elsewhere."
Themepark,2iog1v,TheFigment,5,Thu Oct 9 14:45:18 2014 UTC,I'm all for the villains park with thrill ride idea! I like Disney but it's a once in a while park for me because the rides just aren't exciting. Tower of Terror is the only one that I consider really fun.
Themepark,2iog1v,ilovebajablast,6,Wed Oct 8 19:43:40 2014 UTC,I love of Tower of Terror and it really makes you wonder just how good Disney thrill rides could be. I imagine the Imagineers have a lot of great ideas they've been wanting to get out for a long time but have never really had the chance.
Themepark,2iog1v,tdt0005,3,Wed Oct 8 19:55:56 2014 UTC,"Expedition Everest is a pretty intense ride, at least for Disney that is."
Themepark,2iog1v,tdt0005,0,Thu Oct 9 02:43:50 2014 UTC,very true. pretty good ride. new seven dwarfs mine ride on the other hand? awful. that ride isn't even good at being a kids ride.
Themepark,2iog1v,nukii,5,Thu Oct 9 22:37:42 2014 UTC,"Dark Kingdom is obviously the popular idea for a 5th Gate and what I would like to see. To add to it though, I would like to steal an idea from Universal to force people to buy park hoppers. I would like Dark Kingdom to be build on the opposite end of property from MK. And from some corner of the MK, (maybe the ride even starts from a tunnel under Cinderella's Castle) You board a bullet coaster, this is the longest and fastest coaster in the world. It is mainly a flat coaster but has a few small hills away. The ride is pitched as a teleportation into a Dark Dimension that is the opposite of the Magic Kingdom. You are litterally traveling across different times, dimensions, and worlds. The ride exists just inside the entrance to Dark Kingdom near their ""Main Street"". There is also a return trip to MK with a returning to the MK story."
Themepark,2iog1v,JustAKidFromBrooklyn,2,Thu Oct 9 02:50:23 2014 UTC,"I really like this idea but I think building underground is a non starter because of how high the water is underground and how far they would have to travel to where the rumoured park is meant to be going.  Map for reference. Possible park location is circled in blue with the Magic Kingdom to the North and EPCOT to the east.  What Disney could do however is built an extension to their monorail system. The park seems to be about the same distance from the Magic Kingdom as EPCOT. Even if you don't build a full on ride out it, you could easily super impose some decent video over the windows to make it seem like you're transporting to a much darker place."
Themepark,2iog1v,nukii,2,Thu Oct 9 12:48:39 2014 UTC,"Yeah, I knew logistically the under ground thing might be difficult, but I really only meant starting out under ground. The rest of the ride would be above ground, possibly in tunnels."
Themepark,2iog1v,nukii,1 point,Thu Oct 9 15:24:51 2014 UTC,The Magic Kingdom is elevated so it's entirely possible. I'd love to see Disney's take on this. I'd also love to see Universal's take but I don't think I'll be back to Florida until 2016 at the earliest.
Themepark,2iog1v,nukii,6,Thu Oct 9 16:17:59 2014 UTC,I wish they could make a 100% Marvel themed park.  Also buy The Hulk from IoA and put it there so it doesn't get lost.  Such an awesome coaster.
Themepark,2iog1v,grnmon,11,Wed Oct 8 18:38:01 2014 UTC,"They can't do anything with Marvel. Universal has the rights and as long as Universal honors the contract, Disney can't do anything about it."
Themepark,2ikzoh,WHY-YOU-LITTLE,12,Tue Oct 7 18:35:53 2014 UTC,"It should be noted that the rumor is that a whole new track will be added, and there will be a stand-by only and FP+ only track. It's not like they are making an 'easy to walk onto' ride unavailable - this attraction has ridiculous waits even in low-crowd times.   It's a big problem, and I am glad they are trying to find a way to fix it. These people know what they are doing."
Themepark,2ikzoh,GarlicBreddit,6,Wed Oct 8 05:56:43 2014 UTC,"Telling people who paid 100 dollars to come into your park they are not allowed to wait in line for one of your FIVE rides is still not a good solution. I really hope that is not the end game. Regardless of what they are doing, it was a really shitty thing to do to the people who were affected by this. If someone had PM fastpasses for RnR, and planned on riding TSMM standby during Fantasmic or some other time, they are shit out of luck. People understand rides breaking down, but when you just saved thousands of dollars for this (for some, once in a lifetime vacation) it's a pretty crappy way to treat guests."
Themepark,2ikzoh,tdt0005,10,Sun Oct 12 16:15:14 2014 UTC,I'd be done with Disney if they spread this to more attractions. I live about 15-20 minutes from the parks. When I have a pass I like to just be able to call up some friends and go to the parks for a few hours. Having to reserve shit weeks/months in advance ruins spontaneous trips for locals who live nearby.
Themepark,2ikzoh,deadmemories1,3,Wed Oct 8 01:02:50 2014 UTC,"And I can't get more than three fast passes a day, which makes the park hopper proposition much less useful.   As a local tourist, I prefer to maximize the experience of a single day. To my dismay it's now much more difficult to schedule insane multiple park ventures, especially during my last visit.  A few months back I had written a much more eloquent note about this, but I was quite bitter at the time.   I'm not sure if it's been fixed as of late, or at the very least increased the number of reservations you can make in a day to six.  While the new system is ""magically"" convenient, and makes getting between parks incredibly painless, this is disappointing to say the very least for a ride enthusiast.  However, I am going to try becoming a more photography oriented guest on my future trips, might even invite a good friend along.  I'd better go a few more times while I still live in the area.  The change to toy story mania is positive in my view since the lines were always ludicrously long.  Edit: Addressing the issue, fast passes can be reserved like as close as a half hour in advance, but slower than the old system with cast members and all, but it's an option.  The mobile app lets you work with your reservations apparently, but on Windows phone wet just have this pretty awesome alternative that does everything else better but reservations.  Still, it can be pretty fast and you can make reservations theoretically across the park, and any waits you experience with this load distribution system should be lower.  We'll probably never get the chance to try out the resort experience, though, but maybe just after moving."
Themepark,2ikzoh,Videogamer321,5,Wed Oct 8 01:45:55 2014 UTC,"You can get more than 3 fast passes, just not until the initial 3 are used or missed. Also, I think the whole point of this is to increase availability of fast passes to the point where they can be gotten a couple hours or less in advance and not weeks."

Themepark,2ikzoh,cornponious,2,Wed Oct 8 11:01:19 2014 UTC,This type of policy would lead to me not bothering with Disney anymore.   Hopefully they have some backlash from people over this and wise up.

I wish people would just enjoy the moment."
Themepark,2i9gzn,Thor17,16,Sat Oct 4 11:58:16 2014 UTC,"I know I'm playing devil's advocate, but Disney's visitor base is not just local Floridians who can visit every other day/week/month/year. Sometimes a family's Disney trip is a once in a lifetime event. Being said, I completely understand wanting to get everything on video for memories, or to show people back home who won't ever get the experience.   When my dad was being deployed to Iraq way back when, we took a Disney trip and we made sure to document everything. Being 10 at the time, I was able to look back at all the videos of my trip - with my dad in them, and helped me get through the long months without my dad.  Either way, I think it's an annoyance for those go-pro's/camera combos, however, it's not an etiquette problem.  EDIT: For the record, you can replace Disney with any attraction that's memorable."

But here you're watching video of your dad.  The problem is that people film all of these crappy videos and take crappy photos of individual fireworks, props on the ride, etc.  It simply ruins the experience for everyone else and has no value whatsoever.  Going down the midways and filming your family and purchasing on ride photos?  Filming everyone getting ready or enjoy meals together?  That's great! I encourage that!

Themepark,2i41ql,KaiserCoaster,3,Thu Oct 2 18:12:52 2014 UTC,"These are a blast to operate as well, I've operated the one in the video. You're completely out of guests' view (which means you could have food in the booth!) and watch what's going on with TV monitors linked to cameras in the preshow room and the actual ride. You've also got a window leading into the drum room (what you see in the video). It's typically dark during operation, but you can see the beams on the edge of the drum passing by the window.  Basically, everything you have to do for each cycle starts once everyone is sitting down on the ride. You just watch for the attendant to give the ""close restraints"" hand signal, press the close restraints button, wait for them to give the all clear signal, press the button to close the exit doors, wait for them to walk into the preshow room and give the all clear again, then press the buttons to close the entrance doors and start the ride. You can then open the doors to the preshow room yourself or the attendant will do it. Once the attendant closes the doors to the preshow room, you press the button to start the preshow. That's it. Then you just watch the ride to make sure nothing/nobody is loose. When the ride is over the restraints and exit doors will open automatically, and the entrance doors will open automatically when the preshow is over.  As the attendant, it's quite a bit less fun mainly because you're constantly dealing with guests and have to watch the preshow over and over again. You start out at the turnstile, you let in up to 80 guests while paying attention to height requirements. Once you're full or there's nobody else in line, you go into the preshow room and close the doors. the operator will start the preshow, and you just need to watch the guests and make sure they're not messing with the props or anything like that. When the preshow ends and the entrance doors open, you instruct the guests to put their bags and loose articles in the exit room (the operator should be saying this over his microphone as well) then make sure about the same number of people are on each side of the ride to balance it. Check to make sure nobody has any bags/loose articles, then instruct everyone to raise their arms and give the close restraints signal. Once the restraints are closed, look to make sure they're on everyone properly then give the all clear signal. Once the exit doors close, go into the preshow room and give the all clear again. Once the entrance doors close, open the outside doors (if the operator doesn't do it) and go to the turnstile to bring in the next group."

Wild Eagle: Not too bad but it isn't amazing either  EAT THE FOOD because it's amazing. Not your average theme park food.  RIDE THE TRAIN, because it's actually a real, coal engine train. Soot will even be on your clothes when you are done. Not to mention it goes through the smoky mountain foothills.  I've never ridden the new ride, Fire chaser Express. Also, Blazing Fury is a cheesy indoor dark ride, but I'm not a big fan of it ever since they took out the ride's splashdown."
Themepark,2i1zvh,HoliestDonut,2,Thu Oct 2 22:31:59 2014 UTC,You must ride Blazing Fury there because it is a uniquely weird ride.  Also if open make sure to ride the Mountain Slidewinder as it is again a one of a kind type ride.  The coasters I have been on were great.  I haven't been back since Wild Eagle and FireChaser Express were added but they look good.

Themepark,2hwz4p,mookieananas,2,Sat Oct 4 08:14:19 2014 UTC,"Every other Top Spin ride I've seen is totally open air with no enclosure on one side of it, and none of them have water or fire near the rider, and generally don't have epic music to go along with it. Imagine if the Transformers 4D ride at Universal Studios didn't have water or fire elements to it. Wouldn't that make it at least somewhat more lame than the actual ride by comparison?"
Themepark,2hth86,vinbel121,6,Mon Sep 29 19:58:02 2014 UTC,"99.9% of the time, the restraint thing is just due to the locking mechanism resting between 2 notches, then clicking into place as it gets moved. They actually gave you season passes for that?"
Themepark,2hth86,KaiserCoaster,3,Mon Sep 29 22:22:13 2014 UTC,"Well, I told guest services about what happened, and they didn't hesitate to give me a pass for my troubles. To be fair, it did freak me out a bit."
Themepark,2hth86,JohnnyUpsidedown,4,Mon Sep 29 22:27:14 2014 UTC,"Sounds as if the lock mechanism released and stayed locked on the last safety lock that I believe it cant breach. They have a 3 tumbler 9 lock system. Most likely 2 of the tumblers stopped locking or ratcheting. Sometimes B&Ms will do it, have a freind it  happened to on Kumba. She freaked as the restraint was supper loose and would not relock tight, but it does not come completely unlocked as far as I know."

With out somebody with more detail of the locking mechnism its hard to say what my cause it. Stuck part, failed tumbler lock, could be any number of things. Obviously they looked into it and probably found the issue if the ride was down for a half hour. Usually if a train has trouble they just pull it and back to operation. So there most have been an issue.   Speculation so take it with a grain of salt."

I am sure I am stating the wrong name or exact way they operate but figure my discription is  close to what they are. They explained it on a tour at BGT where they told us all about the locks, just dont remember lots said. Have tons of pics from the tour with all kinds of looks at the train parts.

Themepark,2hjz48,scottwalker88,3,Fri Sep 26 19:27:01 2014 UTC,that would be great if Universal finally scared the crap out of Disney and they are actually going to start building some serious projects but do their constant cutting of rides and attractions i'll  believe it when i see it.
Themepark,2hjz48,wdlkey,3,Sun Sep 28 22:44:21 2014 UTC,"Apparently Universal have taken a 4% cut away from Disney and with rumours of a giant water park (Bigger than Typhoon Lagoon and Blizzard Beach combined), the Kong ride and another expansion of Harry Potter in the pipeline plus another hotel getting built, Plus a 3 day ticket being far cheaper than a few days at Disney, Universal are turning into a major bit of competition.  Apparently the Imagineers are meant to be more motivated than ever so it's a very exciting time over the next 5 years in Orlando to see what's going to happen. Plus Disney will have their 50th anniversary in 2021 so it's really game on."
Themepark,2hjz48,wdlkey,2,Sun Sep 28 23:16:09 2014 UTC,"Do you think the water park was the project that Jim hinted at towards the end of the podcast (the one that he told Lent he would tell about off the air)?  It was kind weird that he would be so secretive about something they spoke about relatively openly on another (relatively recent) podcast, so part of me thought he might be referring to another project Universal has planned in addition to the water park.  I haven't been able to find any websites that have any sort of news or rumors to support that, though."
Themepark,2hjz48,ProWresBlog2,3,Mon Sep 29 00:23:27 2014 UTC,"I'd be fairly certain the project would be the expansion of Harry Potter.  I've found the rumours about the water park a little strange for several reasons. They started years ago and then went silent and since then Universal have bought Wet n Wild and not really done a lot with it. I don't think the general public would even be aware that they are operated by the same company.  The other thing is that there is almost no room on property from what I can see to add a water park that size unless they move it off site which seems a little pointless as they want to keep guests contained in the one area and I don't think running buses to and from a different location would work.  The only way I can see this working would be if Universal bought the land to the east of it's current location and expanded into there but the land would cost a fortune.  The area in blue is Universal Orlando currently, the area in Yellow could be the area to expand into and the only empty area in red is where the new hotel is going."
Themepark,2hjz48,Robotmonkeybutler,1 point,Mon Sep 29 12:04:45 2014 UTC,"I hadn't thought about another Harry Potter expansion, but that makes a lot of sense.  If they are truly looking to add a ""third day"" to a family's trip, I've heard arguments that Harry Potter already does that for the hardcore fans, so expanding what they have would only further solidify that as the third day experience.  I've been skeptical about the water park as well, but only because the rumors have been around so long that I assumed it had fizzled out; you're point about the lack of land is another strong point to back that up.  And thanks for that map, btw!"
Themepark,2hjz48,tdt0005,3,Tue Sep 30 06:42:57 2014 UTC,"The map is purely speculation on my part so I'd take it with a massive grain of salt.  I've read that the Harry Potter expansion will extended from Universal Studios to where the Fear Factor show is currently. IIRC the show is only on at peak times. I know very little about Harry Potter to make any guesses about what a new area could be.  Edit: Since you like maps, the blue area is the current Harry Potter area at Universal Studios and Red is where Fear Factor is currently"

Themepark,2h5sdz,Cyberduck,3,Mon Sep 22 20:27:05 2014 UTC,"They obviously didn't have a lot of budget for animatronics, but they made it up in ambiance. Sometimes they use some less then subtle audio effects, but you gotta love the pirateship scene with music from The Goonies."

Themepark,2gy8yo,tideblue,13,Sat Sep 20 14:00:50 2014 UTC,"I've already posted this but here we go again:  I'm not really sad to see this go. It's become very dated and for a tour about movies, there is very little there. The ride exit is probably the most entertaining part.  I can see a major expansion, I'm sure the road that passes lights, motors, action is either closing or is now closed. I don't see cars land coming as the major attraction is the Disneyland equivalent of test track. I do think a major expansion of Pixar is way over due though. Pixar is Disney's biggest movie studio and has been one of their great achievements. I'd love to see the monsters inc coaster finally getting built. I'd actually love to see Hollywood Studios turn into a bit more of an extreme park as Disney needs one IMO. The other option is a Star Wars land but that would logically expand at the other side of the park and would have the room with that road closing. With 3 movies coming out and it already being one of the biggest movie franchises of all time, they can probably take a bit longer to expand here.  Either way, there is so much potential here and it's a very exciting time.  I was reminded last night of one of my first ride ideas after watching 'Honey I blew up the kid'. The scene where Adam picks up the car and plays with it like a toy, I always thought that would have made a great coaster or simulator like Spiderman."
Themepark,2gy8yo,scottwalker88,2,Sat Sep 20 18:05:28 2014 UTC,What do you consider the ride exit? The place with all the movie props you use to walk through before the gift shop is closed along with the gift shop.
Themepark,2gy8yo,BeastKiller450,3,Sat Sep 20 18:29:11 2014 UTC,The area with the movie props. I've not been in about a year.   The ride must be pretty awful now.

Themepark,2gy8yo,tdt0005,2,Fri Sep 26 07:22:53 2014 UTC,"I just meant it was going to be LIKE those. And I really doubt the expansion will be that minor. The extra track on Toy Story won't be taking up any of the backlot room, it will go where Oaken's is right now. That is a TON of empty space now and I would bet Lights Motor Action is going away too. There will be several new rides or something major. I'm remaining cautiously optimistic."
Themepark,2gy8yo,tdt0005,1 point,Fri Sep 26 14:01:25 2014 UTC,"oh i'm sure Lights Motor Action will go away too since that also costs a lot of money to operate.     Look at it this way,  Frozen is the biggest animated movie of all time, yet they aren't even building a new ride for it.  All they are doing is a cheap overlay for the Malestrom.   If they aren't willing to build a new ride for the biggest money maker Disney has had in decades what makes you think they will build anything else."
Themepark,2gy8yo,tdt0005,1 point,Fri Sep 26 16:35:20 2014 UTC,"First, they are building a new Frozen ride. It's not going to be a cheap overlay, that was the original plan. Second, this is unprecedented to make a ride for a movie this new. Little Mermaid and Beauty and the Beast were just as huge in their day and they just now got a ride/meet and greet at Magic Kingdom. They will build new rides because they have to to keep up with Universal, and MGM is the bleekest of the parks. I think they will half ass it and do it for as cheap as they can, but there will be something exciting in the Pixar expansion."
Themepark,2gy8yo,tdt0005,1 point,Fri Sep 26 16:57:33 2014 UTC,you have a link to the new frozen ride info?   Also no it isn't unprecidented we have Avatar land.

Plus it's going to be down for 15 months, so I hardly think it's an overlay. What in the world does Avatar have to do with Frozen? I know they are making new movies but the first one has been out for years. Plus it's not a Disney movie. I think Avatarland is a stupid idea, but I think they will do it right and it will be cool. And it has nothing in common with the Frozen thing."
Themepark,2gy8yo,Ofreo,1 point,Fri Sep 26 17:07:36 2014 UTC,"15 months isn't enough time to build a new ride.  Especially when they have to gut and remodel the old building.  Even Soarin took more time than that and its just a big empty theater.  Mine Train coaster has taken around 3-4 years, Test Track 3 years.  15 months isn't enough time to design, build and test a brand new ride.   Avatar land was planed shortly after the first movie came out."

It's incredible that Disney have done so little although most of the rides will have to be catered towards a younger crowd even though most of the people who grew up watching these films are adults now.
Themepark,2gy8yo,btgeekboy,1 point,Fri Sep 26 07:33:05 2014 UTC,"not so sure we do.  Current rumors are it will only have a spinner ride and a few stores.   Disney doesn't seem to understand its audience anymore.    When Cars Land opened during the following Shareholders call they actually said they were suprised how big of a hit it was.  They also don't seem to understand that the kids that grew up watching the animated movies in the 90s (lion King, Aladin, Beauty and the Beast, and Little Mermaid)  are now grown up and want to share this experience with their kids.  Which is why its impossible to get a table at Be Our Guest.   Any smart company would see the success of the fantasy land expansion and build more to capitalize on that audience."
Themepark,2gy8yo,slyphox,5,Fri Sep 26 07:41:29 2014 UTC,"I have heard about a lot of things closing lately but not a lot about their plans.  But I think it is great that Disney is not holding onto some of these rides just because a few people are sentimental.  Having never taken this before 2012, I can tell you, there is no sentimental value for me. I can't say what it was like but it is currently a pretty bad attraction.    Many of the parks are in need of upgrades and the sooner the better in my book.  Universal has really closed the gap with Disney.  It is only good for the guests when both entities are pushed to bring something new to the table quickly. Exciting stuff to a local."
Themepark,2gy8yo,BeastKiller450,1 point,Sun Sep 21 02:27:19 2014 UTC,you haven't heard of new plans because there aren't any.  Disney is closing down stuff to save money because of how much My Magic + has gone over budget and failed to increase profits.
Themepark,2gy8yo,tdt0005,2,Fri Sep 26 07:24:00 2014 UTC,"I actually read that they have responded to Diagon Alley by making larger commitments to Avatar and Star Wars, but at the pace they move, it will be years before any of that opens. Though people keep showing up and praising the Little Mermaid as great ride in MK, so they don't need to do much to wow people.   The magic bands and new FP system suck, they have made wait times longer for all guests and do not add much if anything to the experience."
Themepark,2gy8yo,tdt0005,2,Fri Sep 26 15:55:49 2014 UTC,"can't agree more about the new FP system, i've only heard the most hardcore of fans praise it.   Other then that i've never met anyone who likes it.   As for Avatar land that is now down to 1 E-ticket ride and a smaller boat ride that will open 2 years later which means that if the E-ticket ride (which is going to be Soarin over Pandora) isn't  a hit then they will just cancel it.   The best case scenario is that Universal keeps building rides and stealing Disney's market share and that ends up scarring Disney into doing something."

It doesn't have a consistent storyline- it doesn't need it, just the idea of demented toys. Halloween was the last house I went into. Every scare in there felt like it was right out of the movie, because it was. I missed bill and ted last year, but this year is amazing!

Themepark,2go4h3,tideblue,5,Wed Sep 17 15:59:30 2014 UTC,"Even as somewhat of a Disney traditionalist, this announcement really didn't bother me. I guess it boils down to the fact that we're well past the point of no return on this one. I was born in '89 and started going to Disney in '95, so I kind of got to witness the transition from the old Disney to the one we know now. At this point, the Disney World (and especially Epcot) that I grew up with is gone. Nothing seems to be sacred now, and I just have to look at if it's a net gain or loss overall for the park. Maelstrom was kind of garbage, Frozen fits pretty well thematically with the Norway pavilion, and I appreciate the fact that they're not taking 20 some odd to make use of the IP like they did with all the films of my childhood. I really don't see the big jump between having character greetings and Donald in the Mexico ride and this."

Themepark,2go4h3,Ninjabackwards,3,Thu Sep 18 02:38:51 2014 UTC,"Niles kind of touched on it in the article. To me, it's a series of shifts in each of the individual parks and the resort as a whole. Disney shifted from creating as unique of a theme park environment as possible and telling a lot stories that were unique to the parks to being as profitable and working in as many franchises as possible. A good example is the shops on Main Street. They used to be unique, individual shops instead of one massive conglomeration of gift shop. Another example of this is the shuttering of Mr. Toad's and 20K, two fan favorites, both in the interest of the bottom line.   With Epcot it's basically what he wrote in the article. They were initially committed to the ""permanent World's Fair"" idea, with a lot of edutainment and little to no presence of Disney characters.   Sorry if that doesn't answer your question fully. To fully flesh out my feelings about the subject I'd probably need a full-length book lol"
Themepark,2go4h3,cornholio6966,1 point,Thu Sep 18 06:15:51 2014 UTC,"A good example is the shops on Main Street. They used to be unique, individual shops instead of one massive conglomeration of gift shop.    This is such a good point.  I remember being younger and going to Disneyland and the shops, for the most part, were as you described them.    I last went to Disneyland at 16 or so.  12 years ago.  The shops were like, all connected.    Disney shifted from creating as unique of a theme park environment as possible and telling a lot stories that were unique to the parks to being as profitable and working in as many franchises as possible.   This, I do not so much agree with though.  Disney has always been about making a profit.  There is nothing wrong with this though.  Disney has also always tried to work in as many franchises as possible.  It's been their thing for a while.  I do notice a change to the parks though, but I think that the issue lies more in the fact that Disney has a lot of new ips.  Kids going to these parks want to see the current characters that they just saw at the theater.   I think Disney is almost kind of stuck having to do this to maintain being profitable.    Another example of this is the shuttering of Mr. Toad's and 20K, two fan favorites, both in the interest of the bottom line.   Bottom line?  I have no heard that expression before.     With Epcot it's basically what he wrote in the article. They were initially committed to the ""permanent World's Fair"" idea, with a lot of edutainment and little to no presence of Disney characters.   Man, Epcot just got a shit deal for all of it's life and its really sad imo.   Thanks for the explanation and detailed answer."
Themepark,2go4h3,Ninjabackwards,2,Thu Sep 18 08:19:01 2014 UTC,"Yeah, I know Disney has always been about making money. Should have phrased that better. They've always been about telling a story and making money, and I feel like a lot of these decisions sacrificed storytelling. My point about pushing franchises is there isn't a focus on creating stories unique to the park. Figment would never happen today. The lack of this really kills me when there's the overarching League of Adventurers storyline in the Asian Disney parks.  The whole bottom line thing is just saying it was about money. 20K was expensive to maintain and would have been even more expensive to refurbish and Mr. Toads didn't attract young children demographic like Winner the Pooh. So despite fan outcry (especially with Mr. Toads) they got the ax.  I miss the abundance of edutainment in Epcot, but it's still my favorite park. It's still unlike any other park in the world, but it's incredibly different from the one I grew up with. It's like what you said: they have to keep changing to give the masses what they want."

Themepark,2gnaqm,CMVenom,2,Wed Sep 17 15:10:31 2014 UTC,"Based on the SFGAm version, it was fine when it first opened (downright spectacular for Six Flags themeing actually), but the preshow was basically shut off after the first year or so, and the interior effects are hit or miss. Not bad for a wild mouse in a box, but disappointing considering what it could have been."
Themepark,2gnaqm,EricGarbo,2,Wed Sep 17 16:32:53 2014 UTC,"I was at Great Adventure a couple weeks ago and the pre-show was 100% operating and they were using it, the same as with Houdini.  Honestly, it's a great pre-show.  The way the room goes dark during the press conference and all of the red joker lights come on is really awesome.    I live 15 minutes from the Gurnee park and yes, the pre-show is totally neglected.  The way they hold you for the fast passers you basically just blow through the room when they actually let you in and just get right to the station. It's interesting how things have played out at the home park, considering all of the talk about how Hank Salemi wants a dark ride but in his tenure he installed a B&M wing rider and the world tallest/fastest/steepest wooden roller coaster while subsequently neglecting basically his one dark ride and general park theming."
Themepark,2gnaqm,CMVenom,1 point,Thu Sep 18 04:08:17 2014 UTC,"I understand the financial aspect of it, but I think putting the queue in the old Theatre Royal was a mistake. A series of switchbacks has no place in a building with such a sloping floor grade, I was surprised that they didn't level it out. Seems like a potential hazard to me, especially considering the way the average park guest doesn't pay attention to their surroundings.  The announcement of the Justice League dark ride down at St Louis gives me hope though. We're probably too close to get a clone (assuming it's popular), at least not for a few years. The fact that a dark ride is going in to two of the SF parks is hopefully a good sign for the future.  And if you want to talk mess, don't even get me started on Goliath's single rider line."

I Googled and found its Wiki page: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Dipper_%28Geauga_Lake%29  I find myself appreciating the preservation of classic coasters more and more as I go on in this hobby so this makes me sad. I really hope that it gets a new home at some point and doesn't just get demolished. If it's still sitting at the park they should just run it and have a water park + one coaster.

It's so sad to read what I missed out on."

Themepark,2g552u,FunkyHenryGale,4,Thu Sep 11 22:14:27 2014 UTC,I had the same thought when I saw another Cleveland local share this link on facebook. I was honestly surprised it wasn't already on /r/Themepark when I posted it.
Themepark,2g552u,FunkyHenryGale,5,Fri Sep 12 05:31:51 2014 UTC,"Worked at Cedar Point in 07/08, right during the last season of the dry side. The park just siphoned guests off of Cedar Point, which itself was supported by a declining auto industry. It was too close to Cedar Point to co-exist or feed into the flagship with multi-park passes (ala Michigan's Adventure). Plus, the park was not convenient to drive to (not close to any major highways, like King's Island) and had a lot of problems left over from it's growth spurt (in-park trams?).  Sea World Ohio had some great still-standing infrastructure, and it's still beautifully landscaped. And Geauga was a nice park that had too much going on (it certainly didn't need a 3-train B&M or an Intamin impulse or X-Flight).  Showerthoughts edit: When Cedar Fair bought the park, they should have kept the water park where it was during the Six Flags years, removed the Sky Tower/Monorail/Go-Karts/coasters in that area and kept building up the waterpark on that side. Sell off the Sea World side, renovate Wolf Bobs and Big Dipper, tear down Double Looper and Ripcord, and fill in relocated Happy Harbor rides when they fit. Turn the X-Flight area into a concert/festival area that can operate independently of the park's operating schedule. Send X-Flight, Boomerang, and Steel Venom to KI, Carowinds, and Dorney, respectively. Then you could have a 3 Wooden Coaster/3 Steel Coaster park that has a path for sustainable growth. Ah, what could have been!"

EDIT: And before anyone jumps on this, IIRC, it was two separate parks under one brand. So if you get to call this one park, then you have to count all of WDW's parks as one park.  DOUBLE EDIT: Just did some digging, and pulled up this ad from the park, promoting it as actually THREE parks. Theme park, marine wildlife park, and water park. http://www.themeparkbrochures.net/2001/images/sfwoa2001_2.jpg"
Themepark,2g552u,FunkyHenryGale,9,Thu Sep 11 22:46:19 2014 UTC,"Yeah, that was the author's title, not mine.  I have a pretty hard time addressing Disney World as a single theme park.  Tickets to each Disney World park are sold separately, and you have to enter each park individually, even with a park hopper.  After they merged, Six Flags Geauga Lake was a single park- they tore down the gates between them- the article mentions it directly."
Themepark,2g552u,scottwalker88,1 point,Thu Sep 11 23:37:08 2014 UTC,"I know it's the author's title. Wasn't blaming you or anything.  I actually never went to this park, but a friend of mine from northern Ohio who had gone during the WoA days said it was one ticket, but the parks were still separate. The built a path between the two parks (which I believe was mentioned in the article), but they were still two separated parks. Throw in their advertising of the park as ""Three parks for the price of one"", and it seems like they were still separate, just with one ticket getting you into both."
Themepark,2g552u,al343806,8,Thu Sep 11 23:59:00 2014 UTC,"Geauga Lake was my childhood park, and I grew up attending all four of the iterations of the park as it grew, became Six Flags, purchased Sea World, added the waterpark, and eventually got acquired by Cedar Fair and closed...  Once they added the walkway mentioned in the article, I wouldn't have considered the sections of the park any different than any lands of the Magic Kingdom (e.g. Tomorrowland, Adventureland, etc), albeit there was a longer walk between them."
Themepark,2g552u,Almostperfect505,1 point,Fri Sep 12 00:27:07 2014 UTC,"How long we talking? And did each park have their own parking lot / entrance? I'm hearing that they were separate gates, just with a connector between the two parks."
Themepark,2g552u,al343806,5,Fri Sep 12 00:45:50 2014 UTC,"It was probably a 5-10 minute walk from the ""theme"" section to the section that used to be Sea World.  They reduced Sea World's parking lot a bit, but kept that entrance as a secondary entrance. The original water park did not have its own entrance, as it was completely surrounded by the ""theme"" section of the park.   The season after they acquired Sea World, they moved the smaller attractions and non-roller coaster rides (Scrambler, swinging ship, etc) to the locations adjacent to the path between two sides, which made them feel more unified.   It went from being a walk with nothing but a path ""from one side to the other"" to a route with attractions along the way."
Themepark,2g552u,ExactlyUnlikeTea,4,Fri Sep 12 01:22:18 2014 UTC,"Ah, I see. So I guess it did have claim to the ""world's largest theme park"" title. I thought it was still two separate parks, just with a path between them."
Themepark,2g552u,tdt0005,3,Fri Sep 12 01:25:13 2014 UTC,I don't think anybody has identified Disney World as a single park or ever will.   The park mentioned in the article at it's peak I assume had one ticket to get in but Disney is operating 4 separate parks and always has. (Sure you can buy a multi park pass but that's irrelevant)

When I worked at an amusement park if we ever had to tell people bad news we would always take out name tags off though because no matter how polite and how little you could to to rectify the problem they would always bitch and make shit up that you said.  It was always fun to try to spot peoples name tags when it was raining as every one had theirs hidden. It is not fun having the guests yell at you because the ride is closed due to the weather then have managers come talk to you because the guest made up a bunch of crap about you. I had one swear up and down to a manager that I was smoking pot and spit on them and just said fuck off. When as always I apologizes the ride is closed tell them it will open 15 min after the lightning has left the area then tell them a few things that are still open.

There's a pretty good variety of rides, from slow dark rides like the Calico Mine Train to big thrill rides like Xcelerator. It has a nicely themed Ghost Town area to wander around in, and has a strong American old-west feel. If you're in to shows there are some fun ones. Admission is pretty affordable."

Hell, on one day we even did both parks, Seaworld and Aquatica.   That being said, we didn't go on the weekend and the new Harry Potter section wasn't open yet so I can't say with 100% confidence that you would have the same luck as us."

Themepark,2fks45,studiopzp,1 point,Fri Sep 5 23:29:34 2014 UTC,"Basically, no, doing both parks in one day is too stressful. My group was able to see most of both parks in one day, but that was only because we stayed at the Royal Pacific Resort and got early park entry and the Express Pass. The only thing we waited more than 15 minutes for was Forbidden Journey, and we still ended up staying until the end of the day when we accounted in food, shopping, taking in Hogsmeade and watching stage shows. This was a few months before Diagon Alley opened, so yeah.   The best way in my opinion is just a two day pass with one day of park hopper. The first day (with park hopper) do Diagon Alley and ride Escape from Gringotts first thing in the morning right at park opening, but don't dawdle around for too long. Take the Hogwarts Express to Hogsmeade and try to ride the rides there if the lines are reasonable. Go back to Universal Studios and spend the rest of the day there, then an hour or two before the park closes for normal park guests (keep Halloween Horror Nights in mind; I've never done Halloween at Universal, so I can't offer my opinion about that) backtrack to Diagon Alley to explore and take in the atmosphere then a)leave the park entirely or b)go back at Islands of Adventure or c) partake in Halloween Horror Night, which seems like the best option if you're willing to pay an extra $40-50 to stay in the park until after midnight and to see the haunted houses/ride more rides. Second day (no park hopper) can be spent entirely at the park of your choosing, probably Islands if you've spent most of the first day at the Studios."
Themepark,2fks45,Rarietty,1 point,Sat Sep 6 13:27:26 2014 UTC,"If she is interested in Harry Potter at all, get a park hopper.  You need one to see both sections and it sucks to go and not get to see it all.  Forbidden Journey should not be missed.  Focus on the HP two sections, then do the other rides at both parks that you are interested in.  Spiderman, Mummy, Terminator, and the Simpson rides are all pretty great and unique.  Minions, Atlantis, Dr Suess, and all the non-HP shows are massive, slightly cheesy timesucks that you can skip without missing too much. Go single riders, especially on the freefall ride, to save time."

Some people go nuts for butterbeer, I thought it was okay.   In diagon alley the butterbeer ice cream is very good, really thick and smooth. You can get it from the ice cream parlor but to avoid the line try the drink shop right next door. It isn't on the menu but they will get it for you.   Outside of that, I usually eat before coming in the parks.

As everyone has mentioned, your only concern for outdoor rides is lightning. Universal, however, has some great indoor rides, like the two Harry Potter indoor rides (Islands and Studios), Despicable Me, Men in Black, The Mummy, Spider-Man, etc. I would hit the coasters first -- Hulk and Dragon Challenge at Islands and Rip, Ride, Rockit at Studios. Also, Rip, Ride, Rockit tends to break down, so I would recommend hitting that early. Water rides will also shut down during lightning, and you do not want to miss Jurassic Park River Adventure at Islands (Dudley Do Right is fun, too, but JP is my personal fave).

Themepark,2f9t48,WHY-YOU-LITTLE,3,Tue Sep 2 17:39:03 2014 UTC,I keep waiting for the Iron Dragon announcement that will happen in the near future i'm betting.. suspended coasters coast too much in maintenance. And ID takes up a lot of space that could be used for a new coaster. But on the other hand it is one of the few left and it is the longest..So that might keep it alive..I love the ride but I keep thinking that it might not have much time left.
Themepark,2f9t48,Abbey-Road,3,Tue Sep 2 21:54:26 2014 UTC,"I think Iron dragon deserves it's little spot in the park, it is the first suspended coaster I have been on, and it allows kids a small ride to have fun on. (Sorry grammar Nazi's for ending on a preposition)"

Themepark,2f9t48,DEAD_GIVEAWAY,2,Tue Sep 2 18:07:19 2014 UTC,Yeah pretty sure it will just be made into a floorless coaster since the video says 'take one last stand'. That along with a new name and a lick of paint.
Themepark,2f9t48,Abbey-Road,2,Tue Sep 2 18:21:01 2014 UTC,Thats the buzz is that the track is not going anywhere or adding a few tweaks to it but just putting floorless trains in the place of the standups..It would make sense. Esp with the announcement coming right at the end of the season. They are not dumb to know that it would be extra tickets and people coming for one last ride if the Mantis is going to be demolished and would have waited to the middle of the season at least to announce it.

Themepark,2f4ibi,Teddybru,2,Mon Sep 1 00:00:37 2014 UTC,"I've stayed at the Rosen Inn international and Rosen Inn Pointe Orlando. Both fairly cheap hotels and I'm certain that they offer transport to Universal and Seaworld. I've always drove so i'm not 100% on it.  Depending on how long you're planning on staying it might be worth getting the Orlando Flexiticket including Busch too. SeaWorld run several buses to Busch Gardens daily.  Edit: I just checked for you and they run free buses to Universal, SeaWorld and Wet n Wild. Scroll down to guest services. They also run shuttles to and from the airport but I'm guessing there is a fee.  I've stayed here several times before, it's basic but you get free wifi, it's in a good location and cheap. I'd recommend it."
Themepark,2f4ibi,scottwalker88,1 point,Mon Sep 1 16:24:04 2014 UTC,"Your post is quite vague. What is your definition of cheap? How much are you comfortable spending a night, and for what sorts of space/amenities? You mention two queen beds in a negative manner, so are you looking for a bigger, family-style option, or are you looking for a king bedded room?   Cabana Bay is certainly less expensive when compared to other nearby options, and does offer transportation to Universal since it's part of their on-site family, but it won't offer free transportation to Sea World. You'd be best off arranging a shuttle yourself for that from Cabana Bay - I'd recommend Mears, personally.  I should mention that, outside of the WDW hotels, no companies offer free airline shuttles that I am aware of in this city. So you'll want to tack that cost on as well, and arrange for that in advance. For airline shuttles, I prefer SuperShuttle, though Mears does fine if you're on their airline routes."
Themepark,2f4ibi,showtonight,1 point,Mon Sep 1 00:59:29 2014 UTC,Cabana Bay has shuttles and a walking path to Universal. I doubt many hotels would have free shuttles to Sea World though.

Themepark,2f2el6,BlankVerse,2,Sun Aug 31 06:28:46 2014 UTC,Thanks for this.  Taking my special needs daughter to Disneyland was an eye opener as to how little you can do with a wheelchair there. There isn't even a discount on tickets for those kids who can't do anything.  We found amazing workers at the park who helped us get the most out of our vacation. We could only go on a small fraction of the rides and half of those we had to transfer her out of the wheelchair and hold her tight.
Themepark,2f0pca,neon,3,Sat Aug 30 17:36:11 2014 UTC,Interesting  I wonder if they could create some sort of totally enclosed car where 3D images are displayed on the canopy of the enlosure (using polarised displays + 3D glasses?)  This would remove the isolation from the fellow passengers that wearing the rift will cause  Obviously it'd be a lot harder to retrofit to an existing coaster and may even need coasters designed from scratch to take the additional weight that the canopied cars would be carrying but if the VR experience could create the extremes of a ride experience using a simpler physicial track such as using horizontal loops on the real track to emulate vertical loops in the VR environment then it may be that the physical track layout becomes a lot simpler and therefore cheaper to manufacture  edit : spelling

Last time I was in that building was preseason '08, and it still had paint markings on the floor from the ride. If anything would go in there, it would be better to start from scratch. Always thought that a Top Spin with a cool fountain and lighting package would look nice there.  Instead, I hope they put something in the back of the park."

Themepark,2ebhdv,thedanana,1 point,Sat Aug 23 02:14:33 2014 UTC,I plan not to ride it anyway...  I'm just concerned about the crowds on the roller coasters next week. On the weekdays tho.
Themepark,2ebhdv,maxfoo2,1 point,Sat Aug 23 02:15:29 2014 UTC,"Crowds shouldn't be too bad on a Tuesday, but just to be safe arrive early. Try to work as efficiently as possible. Look at the park map and follow the coasters in a circle. Knock out kingda ka early (usually longest line) followed by El Toro and Bizzarro.  Then you can make your way over to Nitro (my favorite and the line moves fast) and batman. If you are pressed for time green lantern and superman can be skipped in my opinion.  If you have any other questions about sfga I'd be happy to help"
Themepark,2ebhdv,dewey454,1 point,Tue Aug 26 03:57:06 2014 UTC,"So I went today...  The lines were quite short. We were able to ride on El Toro, Kingda Ka, Superman, and Green Lantern in the first 4 hours while hiting the go cart race and getting a bite to eat.  The safari took forever, but we were wasted so the people in went with kinda gave up and called it a day after that.  Still, a lot less crowded than expected... Still crowded. Nitro had a 1 hour wait at 6pm :/  We left at 7 only because everyone wanted to call it a day. Whatever lol."

Themepark,2ebhdv,meeper88,1 point,Tue Aug 26 02:04:04 2014 UTC,"Well, I'm not a water ride aficionado (I believe any time at an amusement park not spent going down a steep drop at high speed and/or upside down is essentially wasted) but it seems to me SFGA has more genuine thrills on both the wet and dry sides.  I think the HP Boardwalk has fewer water attractions than HH and, while I do enjoy HP's coasters, they aren't on the same scale as SFGA's, IMHO. Most coaster/amusement park fan sites suggest Tuesday to Thursday are likely to see smaller attendance.  I'd think HP would be less expensive, especially because one ticket provides wet and dry access. Enjoy either!"

Themepark,2ebhdv,dewey454,1 point,Sat Aug 23 00:24:05 2014 UTC,Im just worried about the lines. How are they next week is the question.
Themepark,2ebhdv,dewey454,2,Sat Aug 23 00:27:18 2014 UTC,"Honestly?  The lines will suck.  It's the last week of the summer, so everyone who's been meaning to go all summer and hasn't yet is going to show up, as well as a bunch of local folks doing their last summer fling.  And, it's the last week of summer, so the kids staffing the place will have left to have their own final fling and settle in at college before school starts.  They'll be operating on a severely reduced staff, pulling workers out of the warehouse and accounting to up-staff the rides and foods and games and everything.  Some of the 'lesser' rides will be closed, and the staff who are working outside their normal fields are going to be slower at their new jobs than the kids who had been doing it all summer but are now gone.  You'll still have a decent visit, but you'd probably have had a better time if you'd gone a couple weeks ago.  Edit: go on a weekday; the weekend will be shit.  Get your tickets beforehand if possible, and consider getting a flashpass.  Get there before the park opens, and do the 'big' rides first.  Try to schedule yourselves do that you're not doing things at the same time as everyone else (ie, food lines will be bad between 11.30 and 2, etc)."

I do agree that Iron Colossus will be a smooth and calculated ride, but wooden coasters that are MAINTAINED will not give a jarring ride that makes you feel rattled to death.  Six Flags is a great innovator to take risks on the biggest, newest prototype rides.  However, they've never been much for ride maintenance.   Iron Colossus, and all the other RMC rides will be a boon for parks like Six Flags, and will hopefully need reduced maintenance."

But they mentioned that you do not receive one at Cabana Bay. Is that still the case? I am a local so staying at a cheaper resort to get the fast pass might be worth it.
Themepark,2dts8t,karnek,2,Mon Aug 18 13:02:07 2014 UTC,"You don't get a fast pass at Cabana Bay. I didn't think it was a problem. We did single rider the entire time and never waited more than ten minutes (except on the Hulk, which was about 30.) On a few, I almost think the line we were in was faster than the Fast Pass line. You do get in an hour before to each park though."

Themepark,2dts8t,HoliestDonut,1 point,Mon Aug 18 14:42:30 2014 UTC,I have an annual pass but our fast pass only works after 4pm which is usually when it starts raining (plus universal doesn't stay open all that late compared to say Disney.)

Themepark,2dts8t,boredinbiloxi,1 point,Mon Aug 18 18:32:16 2014 UTC,"It's cheaper if you're just doing universal, I think their parking is $15 IIRC for anyone staying outside the resort but if you decide to go visit disney or seaworld you'll be paying $10 for the hotel plus parking at the theme park you visit.  I'm sure parking is $18 at the other universal hotels and I think you only pay for parking at the more expensive disney hotels.  I think if you're going to orlando for a fortnight, a $140 is a bit steep especially when most hotels don't charge for parking."

And there is also the sad fact of the matter that most of these animals will be safer and better cared for here than in the wild. A lot of SeaWorlds business was built around the outdated idea of being a ""theme"" park where they had to use the animals in shows and spectacles to get butts in the seats. If they will just stop making the animals perform and let them live and play in something close to a natural habitat,I think a lot of their problems will be solved and a lot of the complaints addressed. I have a lot of fond memories of going to SeaWorld as a kid...I'm rooting for them and hope they can come back bigger and better than ever!"

I had always thought very highly of SeaWorld before actually visiting it, but as a biologist the size of that pool was unsettling to me. If these new habitats are going to be nearly twice the volume of that pool, then to me that still seems pretty small. Am I missing something here? Is there somewhere else that the whales go?!"

Themepark,2dimmb,LoganTMiller,2,Thu Aug 14 06:48:55 2014 UTC,"This will sting for a bit, but stocks should average out.  The whole chain needs a management change.  Aside from Blackfish, the decisions in the parks themselves have been kind of dumb between Antarctica, two lawn ornament drop towers,  and the terribly marketed Verbolten."
Themepark,2dimmb,studiopzp,3,Thu Aug 14 11:30:55 2014 UTC,"It's obvious this is hurting Sea World when you turn on the tv and see a ton of commercials from them saying, ""Look how great we are! We're promoting education and the whales love being in our parks!"".  I think the best thing for Sea World to do at this point is to roll with what's probably going to happen (Banning orcas in captivity) and try to save face while doing so. Make an official statement saying that science has recently taught us facts about orcas we didn't know before and reviewing this new information has lead Sea World to decide the whales shouldn't be in captivity. Then they look like the good guys, everyone can move on, whales don't have to suffer, and Sea World can focus on new attractions.  Are the orcas even that big of a draw to the parks at this point? Sea World is now known for their rides as well as tons of other aquatic life. I went to the Orlando park when I was 12 and I don't even remember the orcas. I remember petting sting rays, seeing the shark tunnel, and riding Kraken. Those are the things that as an adult I would want to return to the park for and that down the line if I had kids I would want them to experience."
Themepark,2dg5dm,WHY-YOU-LITTLE,2,Wed Aug 13 16:13:46 2014 UTC,"Cool, this indoor coaster will look really unique. Is it free rotating car   ? For once it's good use of rotating car with seats pointing toward the outside, usually rotating coaster are more fun if you face each others."

Themepark,2dc1u3,DylanTheDespot,1 point,Tue Aug 12 18:29:32 2014 UTC,When I was there last year it started pouring at 3pm. It had been raining before but only lightly and pretty much everything was open during the light rain. Once the heavy rain hit everything shut down and all that was left open were the shops.
Themepark,2dc1u3,Toddlington,0,Wed Aug 13 15:16:32 2014 UTC,I am not sure about Hershey's park but most park don't close anything just for rain. They stop rollercoasters and anything tall for rain with high winds but it usually takes lightning strikes within 10 miles of the park to shut down everything else. Anything with a roof will tend to stay open through lightening though as will trains.  Source: The many days I operated a Octopus/Enterprise while it was poring down rain.
Themepark,2daizc,CoasterCrazyReddit,2,Tue Aug 12 01:11:29 2014 UTC,This is likely a tease. I wouldn't put much stock into it.

Themepark,2daizc,robotshoelaces,2,Tue Aug 12 10:43:08 2014 UTC,"There are some really stupid people on that forum....  Either way: This is exactly the same thing that Cedar Fair did for Banshee.  They ""leaked"" ""The Bat"" page and it turns out that Banshee was the actual coaster and that they renamed Flight Deck to The Bat.  Second, Carowinds has people dressed in bee keeper suits and handing out flyers that had colors that matched track currently at the B&M fabricating plant.  I'm still guessing this coaster is going to be called Fury 325."

Themepark,2ctg1c,AceDynamicHero,6,Wed Aug 6 20:00:09 2014 UTC,Not necessary. Especially if you're going more than one day. Their closing times are between 7-8ish depending on what days you go that week. Early closings are generally a sign of the parks' slower times.   Save the money  Edit: Universal will be closing at 5pm most days because of Halloween Horror Nights starting around 6ish in the evenings so definitely don't spend the extra money on express. The 7-8 pm closings apply to Islands of Adventure.
Themepark,2ctg1c,deadmemories1,1 point,Wed Aug 6 20:19:56 2014 UTC,Exactly what I wanted to hear. Thank you very much!
Themepark,2ctg1c,deadmemories1,3,Wed Aug 6 20:38:14 2014 UTC,"Just remember, if you don't buy it initially, you can always buy it in the park if you do feel it's necessary once you see wait times. I personally doubt it will come into play though."
Themepark,2ctg1c,ReallyRavenclaw,4,Thu Aug 7 00:06:47 2014 UTC,"My take:  I've spent good money to be in the parks... and it's a waste of my time to stand in line for 30+ minutes for ANY attraction. After recently doing a split stay with a few days off-site and then two nights in one of the onsite deluxe hotels that includes the EP, I will NEVER, EVER again stay off-site. It's just not worth it to waste so much time standing in line."

Themepark,2ctg1c,Megosaurusrex,3,Wed Aug 6 20:39:21 2014 UTC,"It depends on a few things. Do you plan on getting there when it opens and staying until it closes? To you want to take your time and enjoy the park between attractions?  I've never purchased an express pass. I refuse to spend $35 on top of an already expensive ticket. But, I'm local too, so there's not much I haven't seen.  I've also seen situations where the regular line is shorter than the express line. It doesn't happen often, but I guess when everyone buys the pass, it's bound to happen."
Themepark,2ctg1c,ninjordan,2,Wed Aug 6 20:05:56 2014 UTC,"We plan on staying at an on-site hotel which lets us into the park one hour earlier than usual and staying until we get kicked out. We do want to enjoy the scenery especially considering my girlfriend is a massive Harry Potter fan.  Like you, I really don't wanna spend the extra money on top of already shelling out over a grand for this vacation."

Themepark,2ctg1c,fancycupcake,0,Wed Aug 6 21:47:31 2014 UTC,"Well, we usually go the last week of september or the first week of october, and I think the longest lines are during HHN. during the day, most of the rides lines don't seem that long. I don't think I waited more than 30 minutes for a ride. I think maybe The Forbidden Journey had a 45 minute wait, but it wasn't that bad since the queue had so much stuff to look at. Also you get time to finish that butterbeer.   Also y'all are going on a Sunday through Wednesday. Most rides, except for maybe the new Harry Potter-Diagon Alley attractions, are going to have relatively short lines, so go do that stuff early. If you think the lines are too long after the first day, get an express pass for one of the other days. In my opinion, y'all probably won't need an express pass outside of HHN."
Themepark,2ctg1c,fancycupcake,2,Thu Aug 7 01:26:11 2014 UTC,"All on-site hotels come with Express passes with the exception of Cabana Bay. Cabana Bay is a little cheaper but if it was me I would stay at the Hard Rock or other hotel where Express is included.   Cabana Bay does have extensive pools, bowling alleys, arcade, lazy river, etc. but that incurs extra cost(pools are free, lazy river you have to rent an innertube).  If you're going to be there during that time frame I would highly suggest you plan on going to Halloween Horror Nights. It's the best Halloween event in the country."

Themepark,2covj4,EricGarbo,3,Tue Aug 5 16:03:38 2014 UTC,Even for Screamscape that doesn't say much.  The truth is we know nothing.
Themepark,2covj4,fermenter85,2,Tue Aug 5 19:26:29 2014 UTC,"This is has been deep in my personal rumor pipeline too, on top of Screamscape. Obviously nothing is locked in until it's announced, but it's often possible to be very confident. That doesn't mean you don't get burned (see Rebel Rocket), but as far as unannounced things that are rumored I would rate an Iron Horse treatment of Colossus as pretty solid."
Themepark,2covj4,provoaggie,6,Tue Aug 5 19:39:56 2014 UTC,"If they tear down Colossus then it will be a sad day. It's not the greatest coaster in the park (or even the best wooden coaster) but it is a big part of Magic Mountain. It's been the 1st ride you see from the parking lot since I was a kid and I'd be sad to see it disappear.  That being said, I believe that they will do a Rocky Mountain redo as was already shared. It's 2 historic of a ride to just tear down and this seems to be what Six Flags is doing with these old wooden coasters. This is really the best thing they could do to give Colossus new life."
Themepark,2covj4,natonio95,2,Tue Aug 5 15:07:35 2014 UTC,"A bit off topic, but Apocalypse is really fast for a wooden roller coaster. I hope if SFMM does a Rocky Mountain redo, Colossus would be just as fast as Apocalypse, if not, faster."
Themepark,2covj4,PantsOfAwesome,2,Thu Aug 7 06:30:41 2014 UTC,"Warning: Unpopular opinion incoming.  I'm really, really happy. That ride is a piece of junk and it just doesn't fit with the rest of the park. It was never fun, it was just painful.  I'm really hoping that they give it an RMC remake."

Themepark,2covj4,fermenter85,1 point,Thu Aug 7 06:28:28 2014 UTC,"It got totally neutered in several ways. This is not in chronological order.  After the first season the ride was intentionally tamed because it was too forceful, supposedly. Also, the speed hill after the second drop was taken out, the two camel backs got flattened to make a block brake, and the ride was switched from the original trains to PTCs to the shit Morgan trains on there now (slower every time). The ride used to run fast and be an airtime machine... not since the early 80s though.  http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colossus_(Six_Flags_Magic_Mountain)"
Themepark,2covj4,soapandlather,1 point,Thu Aug 7 07:54:42 2014 UTC,"I'm really sad.  It's one of my favorite rides at the park, and I have fond memories of going on it when I was a kid and still too terrified of Goliath.  I have my fingers crossed that they'll do a Rocky Mountain redo but I'm driving down this weekend to ride it a few more times just in case.  On another note, I've always been bummed that they've never had both trains running at once.  I wonder if they'd do that this weekend."
Themepark,2covj4,peanutismint,1 point,Tue Aug 5 15:59:39 2014 UTC,"I'm a little gutted. I live in the UK but have been lucky enough to visit MM three times and Colossus was one of my favourite rides in the park. I was fortunate to be able to attend again a couple of months ago, and was really hoping to get one more ride on Colossus before it was torn down.  Unfortunately, the one day we went was the last day of its planned closure for maintenance (they were re-reversing it as I believe it ran backwards for a few months as a sort of final fling...) so although it is still going to be running up until next week I will never get to ride it again.   Sad times but I'm glad I got to ride it twice before that! It's had a great run since 1978.... Also, if it makes way for a new great coaster that'd be awesome, especially if it was a hybrid wood/steel coaster like the new Goliath. That thing looks insane."
Themepark,2covj4,Imaginos64,1 point,Tue Aug 5 16:16:05 2014 UTC,"I haven't gotten to that side of the country yet but it's always sad for me to see a classic wooden coaster get torn down. I'm a big fan of them and it seems like for the most part parks are moving towards steel or the RMC woodies. Don't get me wrong, I'm definitely a fan of what RMC is doing, but it's still too bad."

Also, when I tell people about Southern  Californian theme parks, I can pull up Google Maps and show them Colossus right there - this big beautiful white wooden behemoth not hidden by trees or anything. And it was a great sight.   And even before I was big enough to ride it, seeing it from the parking lot was enough to impress me.   I hope they put something awesome there, but I am sad to see it go."

Just to be clear, staying at the hotel doesn't include your park tickets.  you will gt an unlimited express pass and early entry to the park.    As far as crowds, it should be pretty quiet.  Combined with your unlimited fastpass you will not have a problem.  The only two rides that don't accept fastpass are Forbidden Journey and Escape From Gringotts, which will have far shorter lines then they do now."

Themepark,2c5orv,Imaginos64,2,Wed Jul 30 17:24:05 2014 UTC,"Canobie is a really nice little park. I've been going since I was 3. I'm a half hour from it now but haven't gone in a couple years, unfortunately. I can't think of many specific tips really but if you have any questions I'll try to answer them. Parking is free which is nice. A lot of local stores have coupons for discounted tickets; Market Basket has always been the go to for them but I think other places have them too. Like any park it gets a little crowded on weekends but not unbearable. The Yankee Cannonball is a great coaster and their new one, Untamed, is good too. Check out The Mine of Lost Souls; it's a fun, cheesy dark ride. Besides that I love the Psychodrome (It used to be way better though, with strobe lights and such) the log flume, the Corkscrew, the water slides (The more intense one is awesome) the Caterpillar, and the Boston Tea Party if it's hot out."

Themepark,2c5orv,Imaginos64,2,Thu Jul 31 16:59:02 2014 UTC,My dad convinced me that the Mine of Lost Souls was terrifying and would then proceed to tease me every time we went because I wouldn't ride it. We have weird parents. I was scared of the Turkish Twist too but I wasn't missing out on much with that. Despite being really into roller coasters from a young age I was kind of a wimpy kid. The only coaster I ever refused to get on was an inverted one at Tampa Busch Gardens...I wanna say Montu? I'd read that you go over a pit of crocodiles and I was convinced they would leap up and bite my feet off.
Themepark,2c5orv,Paimun,2,Thu Jul 31 17:15:26 2014 UTC,"Turkish Twist is kinda fun but I think Round Up is better. And yeah, for some reason I had a mental block against inverted coasters for YEARS. I couldn't ride them. I knew they were safe and that the flips were quick and that you didn't really know you were upside down, but I couldn't bring myself to ride say, the Corkscrew. One morning though I just felt different like my aversions to going upside down had disappeared and I broke my inversion cherry on Rock N Roller Coaster and I've been fearless ever since!  Except for skycoasters"

I almost got on Dragster a few weeks ago but they closed it while I was in line due to wind. Besides that it's water slides and drop towers that freak me out. I need someone to just force me onto those things because I bet I'd like them."

Themepark,2c5orv,XS4Me,1 point,Fri Aug 1 01:21:24 2014 UTC,I've been going since I was 3.   I went to Canobie a loong time ago. If I recall correctly they had a waterslide which ended up about 6 feet above a pool. It was called the cannonball. I just browsed through their website and I think they took it down some time.  There was also some kind of alpine ridge where you got to slide in a car down a long track imprinted in the mountain. The car had some lever which controlled the brake. Was that also in Canobie?
Themepark,2c5orv,Imaginos64,1 point,Wed Jul 30 23:17:13 2014 UTC,I don't remember either ride but I'm 22 and went to the park for the first time around 1995 so that might have been before I started going. I tried Google but I can't find any information on either thing. That water slide sounds awesome. Canobie did have a swimming pool for a while so if you mean a small pool slide that could be have it?
Themepark,2c5orv,XS4Me,2,Wed Jul 30 23:42:17 2014 UTC,"Canobie did have a swimming pool for a while so if you mean a small pool slide that could be have it?    Nahh... it was not small . It was a full slide which ended up in a tube, and the tube ended up 6 - 8 feet above a pool. Once you  exited the slide you flew into the pool.  It has been a long while since I went. Sometime in the late 80s so it might have been remodeled."

Themepark,2c53m2,baWWR,5,Wed Jul 30 14:00:59 2014 UTC,"I lived and worked there for one summer as a ride operator.  It was probably somehow both the best and worst summer of my life.  I'd imagine the experience in the positions you are going for is very different than a position like ride operator where there is a huge demand to work there and management has no real incentive to treat employees as anything other than sheep.  It was very frustrating at times as someone who was a fan of amusement parks and legitimately cared about the customer experience whereas many managers seemed to focus only on liability concerns and looking good to their bosses.   Would you be living in the employee housing?  It's a pretty wild time.  There's not a whole lot to do there so the main activities seem to be drinking, sex, and hanging out in the park.  I met some great friends there and look back on it now with a lot of nostalgia.  I came away from there with a much stronger love for the park than I had going in."
Themepark,2c53m2,CurbYourNewUrbanism,4,Wed Jul 30 15:05:49 2014 UTC,"I worked there too as a ride op. Best and worst summer of my life is how I usually describe it to people too. I wouldn't trade my experience there for anything in the world, but I also never want to work there again. Despite what everyone says, try living in cedars/gold dorms. They are older, and in air conditioned, but the people you meet with the close proximity to the park makes it all worthwhile"

Themepark,2c3m4w,kurosaur,2,Wed Jul 30 14:06:15 2014 UTC,"For family holidays and the like, kids will obviously go with the parents to theme parks and it can still be enjoyable.  We've taken both our boys to theme parks and they've enjoyed it and so have we.  Kids enjoy theme parks and as long as they don't spoil it for others, I don't see the harm.  Walt Disney World is a perfect place for kids, so why wouldn't you take them,  same for a number of other theme parks.  There are even theme parks solely designed for kids such as Peppa Pig World, Thomasland, etc.  ...so of course kids will go to theme parks."
Themepark,2c3m4w,LennyFackler,4,Thu Jul 31 06:01:45 2014 UTC,Almost all theme parks cater to kids with kiddie rides and play areas and sometimes a whole dedicated section of the park for suitable for youngsters.   Height restrictions are irrelevant by age 6 or 7 so many of those kids ride anything.   If you don't like kids don't work at a theme park.
Themepark,2c037y,monolithburger,3,Tue Jul 29 01:29:39 2014 UTC,good job. You got lucky! I think that's every kid's dream.

I didn't feel unsafe there, unless you count when I was on Batwing. It's still one of the worst Six Flags parks, so as long as you're not expecting too much you should enjoy it."
Themepark,2bwnv4,pandorazboxx,2,Mon Jul 28 03:20:31 2014 UTC,"No, it has not cleaned up since then, as it's still in PG County.  I don't think it's as bad as you're remembering, though.  Sure, there are some lower-income folks there, but I have had a season pass before and I have never felt unsafe.  Even if the ""unsafe clientele"" you're worried about are around, they're not interested in messing with your day, they're just at the park to have a good time too.  That was always my experience, anyway - and I've been going there since it was Wild World.  That said, it's a concrete jungle.  The theming is nowhere near as solid as Universal, Disney, Busch Gardens, or the like.  It's a bunch of rides put together in the same place.  It's good for what it is - a public-transit accessible theme park - but beyond that I wouldn't give it much.  If you have a car, I'd say try for Hersheypark or Kings Dominion instead.  You'll have a much better time there - not because of different clientele, but because they're nicer parks."

Workers were friendlier and more helpful than I've ever seen at a SF park. I'm not sure whether it's part of an overall effort to improve the image of the park or maybe we just got everybody on a very happy day.   My wife even saw one worker on a clean up crew order another employee to go back to an area to clean up the popcorn that he missed. Expecting to see a giant tub of popcorn dropped on the ground, we chuckled after seeing it was one single piece of popcorn.   Not sure if this is a new effort that won't last, but it certainly was a welcome change from what we saw in previous visits both to SF America and SF Great Adventure."

Themepark,2bw08k,stephenstone,3,Sun Jul 27 21:40:12 2014 UTC,"Have a look at the map online and plan which rides you want to go on and try and have a bit of an order for how you do things, so you can beat the queues for the main part.  The water rides open later, so plan for these later on in the day.  Hit the rides you want to do the most first so you can at least tick these off your to do list.  Plan to have a later or earlier lunch and make the most of other people eating at midday whilst you are riding :-) Enjoy Air, love that ride!"

Themepark,2bw08k,deepinthemeadow,3,Wed Jul 30 22:55:12 2014 UTC,"Don't ride Spinball first - it gets big queues at the start of the day due to it's location! If it starts raining head to spinball and use the single rider queue as the cars can only take three riders when it rains so you should walk on.  Use your early ride time to ride The Smiler, then jump on Oblivion before the end of ERT. Forbidden Valley is usually quiet in the morning so I would head there once early ride time has ended. The Skyride is a good way to cross the Valley rather than walking and don't forget about Hex, it is a hidden gem of a dark ride, also look around the Towers ruins if you get a chance."
Themepark,2bw08k,ROGERS-SONGS,2,Thu Jul 31 22:16:20 2014 UTC,"The park is quite a sprawl, so it's worth working your way around it in a circular motion – the Gardens in the middle are a pretty big chasm, so make sure you allow for that. The Skyride cable car is a good bet for traversing it, and the queues tend to move fairly quickly.  The biggest queues tend to be The Smiler, Sonic Spinball, Rita, Thirteen and Nemesis, so it's probably worth hitting those first/last.  Also, the ride closing times advertised are actually when the queues close :)"
Themepark,2bw08k,ROGERS-SONGS,1 point,Mon Jul 28 12:33:16 2014 UTC,"Yeah I heard the cable cars are a must if you cant stand the endless walking between rides in a park as big as Alton Towers, thanks!"
Themepark,2bw08k,ROGERS-SONGS,2,Mon Jul 28 19:17:38 2014 UTC,"There is a website that lists the current ride times, alton towers ride times, so you can get an idea of when things are busy. The app isn't so great so use that website before you go. Then there'll be big signs inside with ride times. If you have early ride time for the smiler just go there first since it is the school holidays. By 11am the place has an hour queue so get it out of the way first. It's a good wake up call! It usually goes down in queue time around lunchtime (2pm) if you want to go again. Use the sky rides to get to places and the gloomy wood walk is a quick shortcut. I always go in September, third annual trip this year! Have fun  EDIT Here is an image of this years park map since you're a first timer, they're in holders as soon as you get your ticket checked too. Also the water based rides like The Flume and River Rapids don't open until at least 11am, takes a while to get all the water sorted so don't be surprised if you walk around and see it dry."

We also keep everything inside ziplock bags inside the pack, in the case of rain/waterrides.   It's great when they offer free lockers for the duration of the ride, too."
Themepark,2bu5hi,AdamDawn,2,Sun Jul 27 14:07:26 2014 UTC,"Yep. I wear a slim pack under my shirt for my wife and I - car key, passes, credit card, cash, mini sunscreen tube, phones. I say ""under"" as to eliminate any possibility of a ride op saying it can't ride, just easier for everyone all around to keep it hidden.  No worries, as convenient as it gets.  Between rides lift shirt up to take out/put in whatever. I'm not putting on any airs inside a theme park, but sometimes wife will decide I look too dumb with an untucked shirt and wear the pack for us.    We did zippered cargo short pockets for a while, thing was a lot of the pockets were a (weak?) mesh I could see tearing one day, especially with a key poking around.    Up to a few years ago I thought a lightly-filled wallet in jeans back pocket was just fine.  Then I lost mine 2100 miles from home on Bizarro's last bunny (I got it back after close, but the....experience I had in the meantime kinda sucked)."

Themepark,2bu5hi,RealNotFake,1 point,Mon Jul 28 06:30:30 2014 UTC,"The best zippered cargos I've found are these because they have large zippered pockets on both sides, plus additional velcro pockets of varying sizes and they're super lightweight compared to most cargos I've worn. They come in handy at the parks. They're not the cheapest but they're really high quality and will last a long time.  However, I pretty much only wear those when I'm at a park that requires you to store your bags in lockers for certain rides (Cedar Point, Kings Island, etc.). Otherwise I prefer to wear light shorts and then just bring a drawstring bag/backpack and put all my stuff in there. I find that it gets REALLY annoying to walk around with 5+ lbs of junk swinging around your kneecaps and tugging your shorts down all day. And each time you get on a coaster you have to readjust everything and it usually ends up being uncomfortable. Much prefer the bag."

Themepark,2bqkp4,Imaginos64,1 point,Sat Jul 26 02:44:03 2014 UTC,Haha well then let me know how it is!
Themepark,2bqkp4,RollerCoasterMatt,2,Sat Jul 26 11:18:19 2014 UTC,"Get your tickets beforehand if at all possible.  If it looks like you'll be paying full price, check for local discounts -- if you're staying at a hotel check for FunSavers coupons, or see if you can find a Coke can discount.  Get there before the park opens and hit the biggest newest ride (that you want to ride) first, before the crowds start piling up.  Figure out beforehand how many rides you definitely want to do.  If there are a lot of rides, does SFNE have a FlashPass or something similar that keeps you in line robotically?  If so, get that; you'll get more from your visit (if you're only interested in a few rides, don't bother).  If they don't have a FlashPass or you choose not to get one, it's mostly trying to do things at times that other people aren't doing them.  If you do things when everyone else wants to do them, you'll spend a lot of time standing in line.  Don't have lunch between 11:30 and 2, don't have dinner between 5 and 7, don't try for the water rides in the middle of the afternoon.  Expect them to try to subtly herd you toward the entrance as closing time nears.  That 10-minute fireworks show half an hour before the park closes?  Yeah, that's designed to get everyone in a central location sort of near the exit so that crowd control is a lot easier.  If you resist the pull, you can get another ride, sometimes two in, while everyone else is distracted by the fireworks.  (Total aside: Great Adventure had this serendipitous yet really cool thing: if you timed it just right, you could be going through the spiral on the Great American Scream Machine, with the tip of the spiral pointed exactly where the fireworks were being set off.  Roller coaster spiral with fireworks being set off right in front of you!!  You had to judge the lines and the crowds just right to be on the coaster at the right time, but it was absolutely bloody FANTASTIC when you got it right!)  The goal for SF parks is (was?) generally to have their daily operating costs paid for by ticket revenues; everything else is (was?) profit, so try to keep their profits down ;)  If you ride a motorcycle, some parks let them park for free (SF used to, not sure if it still does; otherwise, expect to pay for parking).  Think about packing lunch in a cooler (the earlier you get there, the better your parking will be); that'll help keep costs down and gives you a rest break from the crowds in the middle of the day.  Don't bother with the games at the midway.  You're going on a Monday, which is good; crowds are less.  Plan to go even if the weather is bad; seasonal parks absolutely hate to close for weather (Great Adventure once opened during an active hurricane warning; the park closed a couple hours later with a total daily visitor count of 99), so even if the weather's bad chances are good the park will be open and the lines will be less (and roller coasters go faster in the rain ;) ).   You're also going in early August, which is also good: the last two weeks of August are hell in an amusement park: everyone who's been thinking of going all summer suddenly realises that they're almost out of time so they all rush in; meanwhile, all the college students have taken off to go back to school so staffing is in the toilet (they pull staff from other jobs like secretaries and payroll and the warehouse)."

Themepark,2bpff4,TheLetter10,1 point,Sat Jul 26 01:26:38 2014 UTC,From what I understand they drained Rapids to add some supports to an addition to the Adventure Theature. It's rumored to be turning into some sort of dark ride.

Themepark,2bo22c,80sgirl87,1 point,Fri Jul 25 16:05:33 2014 UTC,I've heard nothing but underwhelming responses to Wingriders. It seems like they could have gotten more bang for their buck with a different type of B&M coaster.
Themepark,2bo22c,nomoslowmoyohomo,0,Sat Jul 26 01:29:51 2014 UTC,Meh.
Themepark,2bo22c,FunkyHenryGale,5,Fri Jul 25 15:29:55 2014 UTC,"Since this is getting downvoted, maybe I should clarify my meh.  This ride is nothing too original. I love B&M, but just because they're finally doing a launched coaster isn't a reason to say this is something brand new.  I personally think wing coasters are a fad. Sure, Gatekeeper is really great, but that's mostly due to the fantastic views of the lake. I'm not too keen on great views of farmland.  The theme feels VERY out of place. Replace ""bird"" with ""hawk"" and this is the standard generic name convention Cedar Fair uses. When the whole park brands itself as a theme park centered around holidays, why would they then go with the generic, non-holiday theme? Or is there some holiday centered around a thunderbird I'm not aware of?  The ride looks decent, but nothing extraordinary, and feels very out of place. Hence the ""Meh""."
Themepark,2bo22c,FunkyHenryGale,1 point,Fri Jul 25 18:41:32 2014 UTC,It's the first launching B&M. Hulk doesn't count because Universal designed the launch.  That's impressive enough.
Themepark,2bo22c,iFanatic,3,Fri Jul 25 21:56:22 2014 UTC,"How is that impressive? This is the first time this specific manufacturer is using a certain bit of technology (almost 20 year old technology at that). That is all. That's like saying ""It's the first album released digitally by Capitol Records. That's impressive"" if Capitol Records didn't release digitally until this year."
Themepark,2bo22c,FunkyHenryGale,1 point,Fri Jul 25 22:27:21 2014 UTC,How does it not count?  B&M are manufacturers not designers so it shouldn't really matter. The ride was obviously built to include a launch given that it goes straight into a zero G roll and the corbra roll immediately after is almost the same height as the drop.  It's not as if the launch is going to be any better than the hulk's anyway. It's 0-60 in 3.5secs which will exert a smaller force on you than the Hulk's launch of 0-40 in 2secs up a hill.
Themepark,2bogon,Stats_,2,Fri Jul 25 09:41:36 2014 UTC,When you collect the fast tracks they will let you choose the times depending on avaliability
Themepark,2bogon,dedmetal98,2,Sat Jul 26 11:18:09 2014 UTC,These are distributed fairly evenly with time for a non fastrack ride in between.
Themepark,2bj35l,HoustonOSU,27,Wed Jul 23 20:32:57 2014 UTC,"Hi!  I work in Diagon Alley, and I've spent a few days doing exactly what you hope to be doing.  You'll be able to pull it off in one day, especially if you follow my advice.  Make sure you have a two-park pass, or else you'll only be able to experience half of the Wizarding World.  You don't have to get there as the parks open to do everything, but it can't hurt.  Your first instinct might be to rush Gringotts in the morning, but hotel guests get access to Diagon Alley an hour before everyone else, and they all have the same idea.  This makes it so the morning is actually one of the worst times to enter the queue.  Instead, I'd recommend going to Hogsmeade when you get there.  For the best views, enter through the Lost Continent side.    If you want to do magic with the interactive wands, I'd hold off on buying one until later.  Ollivanders in Hogsmeade is much smaller than the one in Diagon Alley, and there's really no reason to see both.  Besides that, definitely see all the shops.  Honeydukes is everything you could possibly imagine it to be, and my friends all swear by their cauldron cakes.  Dervish and Banges, though constantly crowded, is home to a Monster Book of Monsters, a Howler, and other magical items that you need to see.  When you're in Filch's Emporium of Confiscated Goods, the exit shop for the Forbidden Journey, make sure to talk to the workers there.  They're all Hogwarts students in detention, and they'll be very grateful for the distraction.  The rides in Hogsmeade are all fantastic.  Dragon Challenge is actually two very different roller coasters, and since the queue for them never really gets too long, you can definitely do both.  Flight of the Hippogriff is a kids' roller coaster, but it's also home to a live hippogriff that draws crowds.  Harry Potter and the Forbidden Journey is something that any Potterphile needs to experience.  If you thought the outside of Hogwarts Castle was incredible (and it is), wait until you see inside of it.  Now would probably be a good time for lunch at the Three Broomsticks.  In all honesty, I haven't eaten here in quite a while, so I can't recommend much of anything here.  I promise, once I get to the Leaky Cauldron, I'll be able to be much more helpful.  While you're in Hogsmeade, you're going to want to sample some Butterbeer.  You can get it at the Three Broomsticks and enjoy it with your meal, but if you choose not to, I'd recommend going inside the Hog's Head Pub to get it instead of one of the carts.  It's much less crowded in there, plus there's air conditioning!  Nobody can agree on whether cold or frozen Butterbeer is better, but I'm here to tell you that they're both just as good.  Pick whichever you prefer.  Before you leave Hogsmeade, make sure to talk to the Hogwarts Express conductor by Honeydukes. He likes to ask people trivia questions from time to time, and if you can impress him with your knowledge of Wizarding society, he may generously reward you with free Butterbeer.  Now would be a good time to take the Hogwarts Express over to London.  Make sure to keep your eyes open during the ride, as you may be able to spot some familiar faces.  Once you arrive in London, make sure to visit the Knight Bus and 12 Grimmauld Place before heading through the brick wall into Diagon Alley.  If you require access to the Ministry of Magic, the phone booth in London can transport you there if you just dial MAGIC.    Once you're in Diagon Alley, take some time to check out the shops, of which there are a ton.  Quality Quidditch Supplies can outfit you in gear to support your favorite Hogwarts team; next door, Weasley's Wizard Wheezes has all sorts of practical joke items.  Madam Malkin's has school robes for Hogwarts students and nostalgic alumni.  The Magical Menagerie sells Ministry-approved magical creatures.  Across Horizont Alley is my store, Wiseacre's Wizarding Equipment, as well as Scribbulus, a school supply and stationary store.  Next door in Carkitt Market is Gringotts Money Exchange, where you can exchange your Muggle money for bank notes that can be used inside Diagon Alley and Hogsmeade.  There's also a goblin teller that you can speak with, though he tends to be a little cranky.  Ollivander's in Diagon Alley is much larger than the Hogsmeade branch. You can watch a young witch or wizard be selected by their wand here, as well as purchase one for yourself.  If you get an interactive wand, you can wander around Diagon Alley practicing spells at special windows set up to train Muggles in the magical arts.  The wands will fit in lockers, so long as you take the box out of the bag and fold the bag in half.  There's one section of Diagon Alley I've yet to cover, and that is Knockturn Alley.  It's a dangerous place to be sure, but many Muggles still insist on visiting.  If you can blend in with the crowds, I'm sure you'll be fine.  There are entrances located near the Leaky Cauldron and the Fountain of Fair Fortune.  Borgin and Burke's is where practitioners of the Dark Arts shop, and I've heard they actually keep a boggart in a trunk there.  They say it's a security feature, I'd say it's just sadistic.  Around three o'clock is when you'll want to get in line for Gringotts.  I only have anecdotal evidence, but from what I've seen the line is at its lowest point in the day between three and four.  The line's been around two and a half hours recently, but it doesn't really feel that long once you're in.  As long as the ride doesn't break down, the line is constantly moving, so you're never standing for long.  After you escape the Gringotts vaults, you'll probably be ready for dinner at the Leaky Cauldron.  The food here is fantastic.  Their most popular dish by far is the chicken sandwich, which is excellent.  My personal favorite, however, is the beef, lamb, and Guinness stew.  Wash it down with my favorite drink they have available there, Otter's Fizzing Orange Juice.  They have dessert available there, and the sticky toffee pudding is excellent, but make sure to leave room for Florean Fortescue's ice cream.  The Butterbeer soft serve is good, but I'm more of a fan of the hard pack ice cream.  Chocolate chili is something I can't describe in words, you just have to try it.  There are also two specialty beer brews available in Diagon Alley.  I haven't tried them myself, but guests say they're very good.  For the next part of the Wizarding World tour, you need to wait until sunset.  Diagon Alley and Hogsmeade are simply amazing at night.  To kill time, watch the two shows in Carkitt Market.  Celestina Warbeck and her Banshees have a lovely set of swing music, and puppeteers from the Wizarding Academy of Dramatic Arts perform the tales of Beedle the Bard.  Once you've said goodbye to London, hop back on the Hogwarts Express, which is a different experience both ways.  When you've arrived in Hogsmeade, just take the chance to wander around, casting spells when you see them.  I'm a big proponent of nighttime roller coaster rides, and Dragon Challenge is a completely different experience when it's dark.  Watch a show or two at the Hogsmeade stage.  The Hogwarts frog choir performs an a capella set, and representatives from Durmstrang and Beauxbatons run a Triwizard Cup spirit rally.  To cap off your night, go see Hogwarts Castle all lit up.  It's magical.  Wow, this wound up being a lot longer than I expected.  If you guys see me in Wiseacre's (my name's Marcus), feel free to say hi!  Don't feel insulted if I pretend not to know what Reddit is, my non-Muggleborn coworkers are easily confused, and I find it easier to just pretend that I know nothing than threaten their intelligence.  If you guys have any questions, feel free to ask.  You're going to have a great time on your trip.  The Wizarding World is something every Potter fan needs to see."

You got us super pumped.
Themepark,2bj35l,AceDynamicHero,4,Wed Jul 30 15:55:44 2014 UTC,No problem! Making people happy is the best part of this job. Can't say I've ever made anyone cry before though.
Themepark,2bj35l,HeThatMangles,4,Thu Jul 31 02:15:17 2014 UTC,"Wow, this is great! Thanks for the long reply. How do the trips between places work? Do you have to grab a return time to board the HE from Hogsmeade to DA, then another return time when you want to go back to Hogsmeade?"
Themepark,2bj35l,HeThatMangles,3,Thu Jul 24 11:23:43 2014 UTC,"No, you just wait in line like any other ride. The porters will scan your ticket before you enter."
Themepark,2bj35l,zex-258,2,Thu Jul 24 15:47:01 2014 UTC,"Thanks for the very thorough explanation! My SO and I will be visiting the first weekend (Sat. and Sun.) of September. We will be purchasing the Park to Park ticket and both Harry Potter locations will be our main attractions. How will the lines be by then?   Also, does the Express Fast/Plus Pass work in the Harry Potter rides? Do you think it's worth it overall?  I saw that Universal offers a 2-Day Park-to-Park ticket with a 3rd day free. Though a great offer, I'm only staying for 2 days. Are there any other good offers for 2 people going for a 2-Day Park-to-Park ticket?  Thanks!"
Themepark,2bj35l,HeThatMangles,3,Tue Jul 29 03:47:13 2014 UTC,"Considering Labor Day is just a few days before your vacation, I'd say most other people wouldn't schedule a vacation at the same time as you. You'll probably have the parks practically to yourselves.   As far as Express passes go, it's really up to you. The passes don't work on Gringotts or Forbidden Journey. If you want to guarantee that you can ride everything in the parks, then it's worth it, but it's pretty expensive. I do know that if you're staying onsite (except Cabana Bay), you'll get Express passes included.   I don't know much about ticket deals, sorry. Everyone I meet at work already has a ticket."
Themepark,2bj35l,thebuggalo,2,Tue Jul 29 03:59:51 2014 UTC,"I have a question and since you work there, I figure you might be the best person to ask. I've been tracking some wait times within the park for  the past few weeks, and it seems like everyday around 3pm there is a huge spike in the line for the Hogwarts Express, the Gringotts line goes down, and other rides outside of Diagon Alley go up... all around 3pm-4pm.  Is there something going around that time that causes this mass exiting from from Diagon Alley? Are people being forced out if they had been there since morning to make room for other guests? Or is that just generally a time when the people who started in the morning have finished everything and choose to move on to the rest of Universal and Islands of Adventure?  Any insights from your perspective as an employee would be very helpful!  Also, if you'll be working the last week of August I'll come say hello."

I can certainly tell you that we're not forcing anyone put of Diagon Alley. It's probably just people who got there first thing in the morning. There's only so much to do in Diagon, and I guess they just finish up around 3."
Themepark,2bj35l,thebuggalo,1 point,Thu Jul 31 02:13:53 2014 UTC,"Thanks for the info! Definitely good to know! Obviously since it's just opened it's impossible to tell what the crowds will be like, but if you had to guess, do you think non EPA Guests will have any problem getting in by the last week of August? From what I've seen, end of August and all of Sept are usually the lowest crowd levels in Orlando parks, but with Diagon Ally now open I have no idea what to anticipate.  I've read that a lot of people are being given return time tickets even as early as 9am for non EPA guests. Is that still happening?"

Diagon Alley as soon as the park opened, headed straight for Gringotts (Line was 6 hours, did the single riders queue and got through it in 2, with the ride breaking down 3 times while waiting.) Explored Diagon Alley, didn't do Ollivanders but I have heard the queue is shorter at DA Butterbeer ice cream a must and line was short Hogwarts Express takes you right outside Hogsmede, got on Forbidden Journey relatively quickly and Dragons was a 10 min wait but then the thunder started and it was shut off.   Basically, DA is worth more exploration, but early is a must, Hogsmede is far more relaxing.  Hope this info helps and have a great time!"

What I have done several times is go to Hogsmeade at IoA first, ride Forbidden Journey and enjoy the area, then get on the hogwarts express and ride to Kings Cross.  From there go into DA, check on Gringotts.  If the wait is still crazy long (more than 160 mins), go check out DA and keep coming back around or check their app."
Themepark,2bj35l,ashella,2,Thu Jul 24 17:40:34 2014 UTC,"Personal preference here - but I'd skip Hogsmeade and just spend the day at Diagon alley. It's much larger and has more attractions to explore. It's designed to handle crowds much better and there's more places to take cover if it rains.   Bottom line - plan on spending more time in Universal than in IOA. It's much larger in person than it seems on tv/videos. And be sure to try the butterbeer ice cream - it's delicious!!  Bonus tip - If you're a AAA member and you spend more than $ 50 at a store, you can get a discount. Make sure you bring the card with you and show it to them at the register. Not sure if it's 10 or 15%, but any bit helps!"

Also, if you have an Amex card, check out the kiosk in the parking lot, where they can give you a similar discount.  If you're a Potterphile, I wouldn't skip Hogsmeade.  Hogwarts castle is incredible, Honeydukes is absolutely magical inside now that they've expanded it, and Forbidden Journey is very fun.  Dragon Challenge is two amazing roller coasters as well :)  And Butterbeer soft serve is good, but the hardpack selections are better.  Chocolate Chili is bizarre, and highly recommended."

The entrance and queue would be based on Aladdin's initial walk through the Cave of Wonders, while the ride itself would be him riding the Magic Carpet out of the collapsing cave. The trains would have an onboard sound system that would play the audio from that part of the movie, and the coaster would be designed to follow it as closely as reasonably possible. The whole thing would ideally be indoors for better theming. The location? Disney's Hollywood Studios."

I know for Halloween a couple years ago Knotts Berry Farm made their log flume Evil Dead themed. I would LOVE to see more stuff like that though obviously I doubt it will happen as it wouldn't be too family friendly. Still, Thorpe Park has that Saw coaster..."

Themepark,2adsgy,FunkyHenryGale,5,Fri Jul 11 00:33:27 2014 UTC,Any bets as to whether he was trying to reach and grab onto scenery...  I see so many people that just act like idiots at parks.  Most of these same people wouldn't mess around near heavy equipment at a construction site.  Yet they feel they are safe to blatantly disregard any safety instructions given in a situation designed for amusement.  Hell I was absolutely amazed at one point where there were videos posted of people hanging on the bridge over the rapids in Thorpe Park in the UK to move between rafts.  I wish I didn't disregard all these things as being rider error but so often it is that I am just so jaded to riders misbehaving.
Themepark,2adsgy,Kmac09,3,Fri Jul 11 15:26:25 2014 UTC,Every time I've been on splash mountain and pirates there's been people reaching into the water to splash their friends.   This is what ends up causing the parks to install barriers to prevent people from reaching out.

The only ride that we had that happen on was Primeval Whirl at Animal Kingdom. We were about 5 feet from the begging of the ride. But they had to bring the steps over, and make only one person at a time. We could have just stepped off but whatever, gotta be safe. Not much to see on that ride. Better than the 25 minutes we stayed on small world and they never took us off. That was torture as they never turned off the song."

Themepark,2aajfk,Enigmutt,7,Thu Jul 10 01:26:45 2014 UTC,We never went back. It was about a 1 hour wait to get to lockers and then our fast passes would let us by pass the 360min line.

Themepark,2aa3hv,randye,1 point,Thu Jul 10 01:32:25 2014 UTC,"We go to Universal Orlando once or twice a year.  You do not have to stay at an onsite hotel for early admission for Harry Potter as long as you are staying in a partner hotel, which are listed on their website. A nice close one is the Hilton Garden Inn. The real advantage to staying in an onsite hotel like the Hard Rock, besides being in walking distance, is the express passes.  They are included in your hotel price and are unlimited all day for any ride that they can be used for. Purchased fast passes can only be used once per ride per day and average about $80 per person per day so if someone is going to purchase fast passes, it's actually less expensive in most cases to stay onsite even though the rooms are generally more expensive. The pool at the Hard Rock makes it worth it too (well any of the pools onsite but I'm partial to the Hard Rock). Fast passes are not available for some rides, such as Harry Potter and the Forbidden Journey which has a single rider line and Escape From Gringotts which likely has a single rider line also.  Express passes are included when you you stay at the three deluxe onsite hotels but the new Cabana Bay resort is a value hotel and the express pass is not included.  Have a great trip!"

Themepark,2a6y01,GadgetFreehan,5,Tue Jul 8 23:55:09 2014 UTC,"I think aesthetically and character-wise, Futurama would make great material for a theme park.   However, I don't think Futurama would really get anything, let alone something that would have them taking out Men in Black. Simpsons has longevity and familiarity with American Audiences, whereas Futurama is well known but seems to flip-flop in and out of cancellation. It wouldn't really be worth devoting a whole area too for that reason - with Simpsons, it's a safe investment to do a whole area.   I could be wrong, but I really wouldn't foresee Futurama getting anything outside maybe a B-Ride (similar to Kang and Kodos) in or near the Simpsons area."
Themepark,2a6y01,davidreamcatcha,1 point,Wed Jul 9 01:47:55 2014 UTC,"I see what you mean. I didn't know about Futurama until reading an article about the original cancellation in 2006. But I do feel, as you mentioned, that it could possibly make possibly amazing theme park material. Seeing what Universal has done time and time again with their spectacular Harry Potter sections and rides like Transformers and hell, even King Kong 360 3D at the Studios in Hollywood, Universal could go beyond even the pun intended Technical Wizardry in Diagon Alley and make something possibly beyond the limits of current technology and make their own, right down to the patents.  I would be disappointed if Futurama gets a B-Ride in Springfield, but if Universal decides to dick us that hard, I'm sticking with Disney"
Themepark,2a6y01,scottwalker88,3,Wed Jul 9 02:08:12 2014 UTC,"Maybe a few years ago I could have seen it but not any more. The Simpsons and Harry Potter are BIG franchises with a lot of fans. Futurama is great but I don't think it would have the presence needed.  It is an interesting topic though. Where do you go now?  I have the impression that Disney were watching the opening of Diagon Alley and were completely miserable. Not to mention that they seem to be moving at a sluggish pace to make new rides especially after how over budget the Disney magic+ went. They also have two massive franchises now with Marvel and Star Wars but they can't do anything with Marvel as long as it's in Islands of Adventure. I don't think Universal can add any new rides to it either though without getting Disney's permission so I doubt we'll see any progress there for a very long time if ever.  IIRC Comcast made a promise to add a major new attraction to Universal Orlando every year until 2018. With Diagon Alley just opening and the rumoured King Kong attraction started construction already, the ball is still rolling.  Other rumours going about is that Universal was interested in building a water park on site even though they bought Wet n Wild not that long ago.  As for actual future rides. In Universal Studios, they still have plenty of room. An Appollo 13 rollercoaster was planned for where Men in Black went and there is a large area between Men and Black and the Simpsons where a massive ride could be built or several. The rights for Lord of the Rings are up for grabs and could make some interesting rides and given what Universal have done with Harry Potter, they now have a proven track record that can compete with Disney. I also think that some current rides could be retired soon with Terminator 2, Twister and ET. There is also land up by Twister that could be expanded as the employee car park has been relocated.  For Islands of Adventure, I think the two options available is that The Lost continent goes as it just seems like an afterthought now or they sell the rights to Marvel and redo the whole area. The main problem being that Spiderman and The Hulk are classic rides and some of the best in the world. Do they sell them to Disney and have the ability to boast that they sold rides to Disney or do they retheme the area? Originally I think it was meant to be DC not Marvel so whether they can revert back to that especially with interest in the DC universe starting to rise again.  All of this is just thoughts on creativity because when it comes down to attendance and money, Disney are still dominating by a large margin but Universal is certainly making ground now.  I also don't doubt that Universal probably already have far better ideas in the works that span many years into the future. I'd also be surprised if there wasn't a Fast and the Furious ride being developed some where given their success recently and it's also a Universal property or possibly making a ride from a computer game."
Themepark,2a6y01,Dr_ChimRichalds,2,Wed Jul 9 20:52:39 2014 UTC,"Universal would be wise to dump their contract to Disney and re-theme Marvel Superhero Island all together.  Having worked for both Universal Studios Florida and the Walt Disney World Resort, I was incredibly surprised how absolutely combative Universal was toward the Disney Company. They made several references to the ""parks with the mouse"" during training, making disparaging remarks about them as the competition. By contrast, Disney made absolutely no mention of any other theme park during the entire onboarding process.  All that to say that I'm afraid Universal will hold onto the IP in-park in a bitter and spiteful way, even when the direction of the IP itself is not within their control in any manner. It would be to Universal's detriment not to explore other options while taking a sizable buyout from Disney.  At any rate, the potential for expansion of Star Wars at WDW is real, but I'm curious whether the company would be interested in a standalone park as they were for Harry Potter.  Lord of the Rings would do very well under Universal, but there's a big question mark on where it would go. It would be most thematically relevant at Islands of Adventure, since the park's theme is literature in various forms (Greek classics, Seuss books, Marvel comic books, the Harry Potter books, Crichton's Jurassic Park books, newspaper comics). I would like to see them replace Marvel with LotR, but I don't think the area is large enough to accommodate it."
Themepark,2a6y01,scottwalker88,1 point,Thu Jul 10 03:11:32 2014 UTC,"I think Universal have tried to make a point of showing that they are different from Disney but there will always be comparisons. In a way it's kind of sad that Universal will hold onto Marvel as a giant fuck you to Disney but as it stands, the area is still holding up well even though it's 15 years old which I find hard to believe. If they give up the IP, it could mean great things for Disney and the consumer but that's providing Disney actually want to do something decent with it.  I really hope that if Disney decide to build a 5th park, whether it be Star Wars, Marvel or the rumoured Disney Villians from ages ago that they aim for a more adult park with more intense rides instead of aiming for their usual 8 year old demographic. Don't get me wrong, it works, kids love it and parents love to see their kid having a great time but there is a huge market for adults at Disney. Look at all the people drinking around the world at EPCOT.  I think there is enough space to add a LotR area in where Marvel is currently. Spiderman takes up a lot more room than most people think.  Marvel area is in red and Harry Potter is in blue  Size wise, they are comparable.  This was posted today with possible ideas for Universal's rumoured water park"
Themepark,2a6y01,Dr_ChimRichalds,1 point,Thu Jul 10 10:18:38 2014 UTC,"For some reason, I remember looking at the aerial view and seeing it as much smaller. Hmm. It could be the perfect area for it. Give the Incredible Hulk a new coat of paint and rebrand it, possibly repurpose the ride mechanics of the Amazing Spiderman (though they'd draw bigger crowds with more expensive next gen mechanics), and rip out the rest. I'd like to see them do something like this in the next five years, while focus rests on Hogsmeade, Diagon Alley, and - to a lesser extent - the Simpsons.  Considering how much Disney has tried to make Epcot kid-friendly, I doubt they'd be able to satisfy investors with the concept of a standalone targeted at adults. As much as I may personally hope for that concept..."

If you're just staying for a few days and only doing Universal, it's a good deal but if you're staying for longer and plan on doing Disney or SeaWorld or anything outside the resort, it becomes a bit of a pain having to pay parking just to stay at your hotel."

There is also a Harry Potter Welcome package coming our way.  There are also packages that include staying on their resort.  They also have deals that include cheap airfare."
Themepark,29xqhw,CurbYourNewUrbanism,8,Sun Jul 6 01:14:15 2014 UTC,I haven't followed this story as closely as I've followed others but why the hell didn't the park look into this BEFORE building Zumanjaro and therefore destroying the capacity of both rides? Surely the state would have to approve their idea before they started building it. Zumanjaro especially is going to be absolutely insane if they only run it once for every two Kingda Ka launches.
Themepark,29xqhw,Imaginos64,3,Sun Jul 6 16:31:22 2014 UTC,"If true, this might be a temporary clause. Zumanjaro only opened recently. To ensure safety, the state may simply need to collect data."
Themepark,29xqhw,nthdesign,2,Sun Jul 6 17:06:52 2014 UTC,"I was at great adventure yesterday (july 6th) and both of these rides were constantly being shut down.  I used a flash pass so I was always alerted whenever kingda ka or zumanjaro re-opened, it must have been at least 4 times for each ride.  Zumanjaro was completely shut down on flash pass after 5pm which let me ride kingda ka a few times.  It was extremely annoying, and I was unable to ride zumanjaro the entire day after my reservation was canceled 3 times!"
Themepark,29xqhw,LukeChemistry,0,Mon Jul 7 22:34:46 2014 UTC,"It is a new ride, and if I recall started normal operation literally two days before, on the holiday. Stoppages on new rides are always expected."
Themepark,29xqhw,Smiley007,1 point,Thu Jul 10 05:19:17 2014 UTC,"This wasn't normal stoppage like I've seen on new rides.  This was six flags shutting down and alternating which rides were operating between kingda ka and zumanjaro, like stated in the original post."
Themepark,29xqhw,LukeChemistry,4,Thu Jul 10 13:28:35 2014 UTC,I'm not familiar with this park and it's rides...what exactly is happening here?
Themepark,29xqhw,movieguy84,10,Sun Jul 6 03:23:34 2014 UTC,"Six Flags Great Adventure built a 400 foot tall drop tower attached to the structure of the existing Kingda Ka roller coaster.  Allegedly (definitely not at all confirmed) the New Jersey Carnival-Amusement Ride Safety Unit is not permitting the park to have a Kingda Ka train and the Zumanjaro cars moving on the tower at the same time.  The reason for that (if it is true) is unknown, though there is speculation that it is out of concern for loose articles from one ride hitting people on the other (which doesn't really make a ton of sense).  Neither ride has great capacity to begin with and this would make it much worse."
Themepark,29xqhw,hypocaffeinemia,2,Sun Jul 6 03:41:59 2014 UTC,Build a mesh netting on the top to the side that has the drop tower. Problem solved.
Themepark,29xqhw,Picassoraptor,8,Mon Jul 14 20:50:34 2014 UTC,"Zumanjaro is built into Kingda Ka's structure so if they ran simultaneously it would look like this then it would drop.   Which is pretty cool, but NJ Law is stopping this possibly for some safety reason (IE something falling from the Kingda Ka cars onto the Zumanjaro ride). So now The coaster runs 2 trains then Zumanjaro drops from the top."
Themepark,29xqhw,movieguy84,1 point,Sun Jul 6 03:45:44 2014 UTC,"Got it! Looks awesome, but sucks since both rides probably didn't have high capacity before this situation."
Themepark,29xqhw,KingdaToro,3,Mon Jul 7 05:38:58 2014 UTC,"Kingda Ka potentially has a high capacity but they don't run it to its potential. It's designed to run 4 trains in its 4 stations, with the two trains on one side running while the two on the other side are loaded. Instead, they use only one station and three trains, with the back station used as a holding brake. It's limited by loading time, rather than by the reset time for the launch as intended.   Ironically, this method of operation allows it to work pretty well with Zumanjaro. The attendants can continue loading and dispatching trains until there are two stacked waiting to launch, and by the time they're ready to dispatch the third, Zumanjaro will have likely finished its cycle and the first train waiting will have launched and returned.  As for Zumanjaro, it seems to pretty much be able to run at will. The time from a Kingda Ka train being launched to the point it reaches the bottom of the drop is only 25 seconds, then it will take another 50 seconds or so for the next train to be ready to launch. Zumanjaro is usually able to start after the second train, but sometimes three Ka trains ran between Zumanjaro cycles if it was taking too long to load."

The fare from the airport to Sandusky is likely to be ridiculous.  I work at a hotel that's only about a half hour away the airport and cabs to the hotel are upwards of $60 one way.  Good luck!"

If you're going to stay in Sandusky expect to spend at least $110 for a semi decent room. Read lots of reviews ahead of time. Even the rooms at normally decent chains can suck (mold, mildew, filth, noise, security and general disrepair.)  Although, I guess I had a once in a lifetime experience staying one night at the (now defunct) Dusk to Dawn. It made Motel 6 seem like a five star resort.

Themepark,29fyxw,RedOneTwoThree,2,Wed Jul 2 01:06:05 2014 UTC,"There are no sensors to sync them up, they're completely separate rides. Intentionally running them in sync will decrease capacity. When it does happen, it'll be a coincidence. However, the current method of Kingda Ka operation (3 trains loading and unloading in only one station) is limited by loading time rather than launch interval, so the launch operator will have some breathing room to sync it with Zumanjaro if he wants."

The area of the park that's flooded is the back area on the west side of the park, (google maps for reference) 3 rides are currently shut down- Renegade (GCI woodie, center left, 9.5/10 coaster), Excalibur (1989 Arrow B-Team woodie hybrid- 3/10 coaster), and Thunder Canyon (standard river rapids ride). In addition the employee parking is flooded (it floods any time the river rises) and the main parking lot, so people are parking in the ""Field of Dreams"" (Note the field just east of the park on Park Drive), and I think they might be shuttling people in from somewhere.  I'm hoping Cedar Fair will invest a little bit of money into the park soon (2016 is it's 40th birthday, hopefully we get something), and I really hope a nice set of Berms is included. Losing all of the parking like this at least once a Summer is silly."
Themepark,292rn3,astilwell,11,Wed Jun 25 18:01:09 2014 UTC,Everything about this is very clever. You convince people to buy a two park ticket and get people to go back and forth between the two parks with a unique attraction while using pretty simple technology.   All the videos I've seen so far look very impressive.
Themepark,292rn3,scottwalker88,10,Wed Jun 25 21:15:01 2014 UTC,More fun trivia: The distance between the two stations is only ~0.5 miles.
Themepark,292rn3,lumberbrain,4,Wed Jun 25 23:41:54 2014 UTC,I'm actually a little surprised that Universal doesn't have fake conductors pretending to control the trains.
Themepark,292rn3,anyhistoricalfigure,1 point,Thu Jun 26 01:17:10 2014 UTC,Maybe they will during the really busy times of year.
Themepark,292rn3,Amnesiac76,1 point,Tue Jul 1 02:06:52 2014 UTC,Does each train have a 'Front' part on either end?
Themepark,292rn3,likethecolour,1 point,Thu Jun 26 11:10:23 2014 UTC,Nope. The whole train goes backwards. Which may look a little odd.
Themepark,292rn3,Touch-fuzzy,1 point,Thu Jun 26 12:41:35 2014 UTC,Yeah. You would think they at least put a 'front' carriage at each end? No? Maybe? Hrm.
Themepark,292rn3,likethecolour,1 point,Thu Jun 26 20:45:17 2014 UTC,I thought they might have had a dummy locomotive at both ends too. But steam trains can go backwards. So I guess it is authentic in that sense. Hogsmeade is in the middle of nowhere and is probably the end of the line anyway. The HE probably would have needed to reverse back part the way anyway.   That or they'd have used magic....
Themepark,292rn3,Touch-fuzzy,1 point,Thu Jun 26 21:21:05 2014 UTC,"Yes, but it's not always the ""front"".   Each train has a single engine (front car) and single caboose (rear car). So the train arrives at one of the stations caboose-first (backwards), and departs the station engine-first (forwards), or vice-versa. Here's a video of this happening.   The train going backwards is so un-picturesque and, in my opinion, downright immersion-breaking, that it's been bothering me over the last few days. I even made a diagram with a potential solution:   http://i.imgur.com/PkYOzmT.png"
Themepark,292rn3,lumberbrain,1 point,Wed Jul 2 02:48:59 2014 UTC,"I am more concerned about capacity. I was reading on a blog estimates of only 6-9 thousand a day. Well short of other major attractions. I have also heard rumors that guests will be limited to one ride a day, so no round trip even if you are willing to wait in line twice. While it sounds cool, I am not one to wait for 3 hours for a ride, so I am guessing I will not get on until much later this year."
Themepark,292rn3,Ofreo,2,Sat Jun 28 13:13:03 2014 UTC,"I heard around 3,000 people per hour, but that's total. So for each station that's only 1,500 per hour."
Themepark,292rn3,Amnesiac76,2,Tue Jul 1 02:05:49 2014 UTC,"You kind of have to look at it as two rides, because one is in each park. So to me it seems low, but as everyone has to have park to park to do it, there may be a lot of people who are ineligible to ride."
Themepark,292rn3,Ofreo,1 point,Tue Jul 1 02:25:49 2014 UTC,I guess it would all depend on what time of year you went there. I went to Universal in 2012 at the end of April and there were no lines for anything. I rode the forbidden journey ride 5 times in one day.
Themepark,290tna,cocktailshandy,12,Wed Jun 25 02:20:35 2014 UTC,There was a high chance of thunderstorms but didn't roll in until the afternoon. My friend and I basically walked on to every ride we wanted to. It was wonderful!
Themepark,290tna,AdamDawn,3,Wed Jun 25 02:22:18 2014 UTC,These are my favorite kind of days. I only live about 45 minutes from Busch Gardens Tampa and would wait for days that rain was forecast for this exact reason.

Themepark,28ufzk,invaderark12,5,Mon Jun 23 04:07:56 2014 UTC,"If you're into Harry Potter and are willing to fight the early crowds then definitely.  Staying at the Universal Resorts is great...early access, express pass and other perks make it totally worthwhile.  Plus they're all within a few minute walk or boat ride from the parks. Not like Disney's resorts of which most include a 30 minute commute. Fun."
Themepark,28ufzk,quitepossiblylying,3,Mon Jun 23 12:08:10 2014 UTC,"Here's a few pictures of what to expect of the crowds if you go next month:  here, here and here  If you know Universal Orlando slightly you'll realise how big this queue is considering it stretches to Universal Studios and the entrance is at Islands of Adventure.   I love theme parks but I would never in my life wait in that."
Themepark,28ufzk,scottwalker88,3,Mon Jun 23 13:17:43 2014 UTC,"I think it's a good deal, since, as others have said, staying on property has some nice perks.  However, I want to emphasize that it's going to be super crowded in the HP areas.  I would wait till November, at the earliest, before going.  I went a few weeks after springfield opened and we waited nearly 2 hours just to get a krusty burger.  And that is nothing compared to how the HP area was for the first year or so."
Themepark,28ufzk,Lilusa,2,Mon Jun 23 19:20:28 2014 UTC,If you're going to Universal anyway and especially if it's before July 8th then it's worth it for sure. You won't be likely to get in before July 8th otherwise and with the express passes and early access you should have a good time (though the express passes won't help with HP). If you're not planning to go anyway I would definitely wait. The best time is a weekday during the school year. It's so hot and crowded at this time and you can enjoy exploring all the little details so much better when there aren't so many people.
Themepark,28ufzk,trisaratops1,2,Mon Jun 23 13:56:22 2014 UTC,"That price is astounding when you consider a 1-day park ticket is north of $90.  $109 per night gets you a fantastic themed breakfast, park admission, and a partner hotel room that would be hovering around $80 per night on it's own?

Themepark,28lsfb,invaderark12,3,Fri Jun 20 01:37:23 2014 UTC,Make sure to get the park hopper tickets as the Hogwarts Express requires a two park ticket to ride.
Themepark,28lsfb,Smithyincucf,2,Fri Jun 20 01:53:05 2014 UTC,"You many want to come to terms with the fact that you won't be able to hit everything in the time you are here due to the sheer amount of people. You're going to want to research ahead of time the rides/shows that are a must do and which ones you would be okay with skipping. Then out of the ones you want to do, Try and hit the ones that get the busiest the quickest. So the HP stuff is definitely going to be packed. HRRR tends to get rather backed up. The Mummy is hit or miss. Usually it's quiet but there are times where I've seen it packed. The biggest reason for this is the low capacity compared to something like The Hulk next door."
Themepark,28lsfb,dorasucks,2,Fri Jun 20 12:46:23 2014 UTC,"Yeah, considering I went 4 years ago there will be stuff I skip. I'm not a big fan of crazy roller coasters like HRRR so I'm good."
Themepark,28lsfb,AdamDawn,1 point,Fri Jun 20 16:01:12 2014 UTC,"The on-site hotels offer early admission and Express Passes which will greatly cut the lines for the rides. If you can afford it, that might be the way to go. However, the new HP rides (and a few of the ""old"" ones) will not be using the Express Pass system, so for those unfortunately, you'll be waiting in line regardless of what add-ons you purchase. But cutting the time for everything else, 1 or 2 crazy lines might be more tolerable, IMO."

Themepark,28lsfb,doctordollaz,1 point,Fri Jun 20 18:43:36 2014 UTC,"If you're thinking of staying at Cabana Bay, make sure they do the early park admission there.

Themepark,28lsfb,KristenTatas,1 point,Fri Jun 20 13:28:10 2014 UTC,"Just recently got back from Orlando, and went to Universal's parks on the 14th and 15th... You are probably going during peak times AND of course, just after Diagon Alley has officially opened, so expect LOTS of people.   My suggestion would be to buy express passes (I don't think any of the Harry Potter rides use them, but you will definitely need them for the other great rides). If you can't afford them, consider the Q-bot (cheaper, works like Disney World's fast pass system. It's super easy to use and a great express pass alternative!)  Some other tips:   Prioritize your rides. If the Wizarding World of Harry Potter is a must, make it your first stop.  Don't arrive late; arrive at either park EARLY, when they just open.  PLAN. Orlando Informer is a great resource. You should also consider downloading Universal's recently released app for the park. It's got GPS and wait times, etc."
Themepark,28lsfb,KristenTatas,1 point,Mon Jun 23 04:53:57 2014 UTC,"Don't sweat it. My family and I take a orlando vacation each year - and I have never had to miss out on too much due to crowds. I will also be there a week after the opening of Diagon Alley! Advice from my experience from the first harry potter opening, is to expect crowds and to expect lines. For the first day you're going to the parks, arrive early and be prepared to spend the entire day there. You may be tired and exhausted but you will have time to do almost everything. If you're purchasing a multi day ticket and are planning on using every day, try coming to the park a little later around 4pm for your second or third trip there. By this time a lot of the early morning people will be leaving, and also the heat will be on it's way out. My family's little trick is do this after a big rain storm- the rain and the time will encourage people to leave the park. Leaving you with shorter times and a much more enjoyable experience. During this time you may not have enough time to do everything in the park - but you will have a enought time to do the repeat attractions you loved on your fist full day trip. Don't forget to just enjoy the experience, don't worry too much about running from attraction to attraction each time you go. The first time is fine, but after that soak in the amazing detail in the shop windows, the music which fits the lands and sections perfectly, and the amazing products you can find in the shops. Experience everything the park has to offer, not just the rides - but the shows and the atmosphere.   I hope my little insight helped you a little bit, and feel free to PM me with any universal studios questions. You can say I'm a bit of an enthusiast. (That's a lie I'm more than a bit, lol) If you need any recommendations or hints or tips on a specific aspect of the park feel free to ask me!"

Themepark,28gmws,trisaratops1,2,Wed Jun 18 23:11:28 2014 UTC,"I think I remember reading something about this. It was either they never had one for the first Harry Potter area and this one will or they had one for the first and not for this. I hope you're in luck anyway.

Was it a day or just an evening? Power passes have blockout dates at USF this summer--if they did it would it mean it would only be for the two higher tiers? People who purchased a DA vacation package have guaranteed access starting in the end of June. I heard it will likely only be a few hours a day, though. They could set aside some time for APHs."

Just part of working out the kinks of a new ride. But there was never any danger to riders or any outcome that could even be considered ""news"".

I love Knotts' Ghost Town and I got to ride Calico AND the refurbished Log Ride last year, great stuff. Can't wait to see the new mine ride.  Now if only they would give Ghostrider a little TLC. It's just a little rough."
Themepark,28a8pj,Paimun,2,Mon Jun 16 17:35:59 2014 UTC,"From the activity that we have seen these past few days, there is a strong indication that the dark dinosaurs ride might be making a come back. There's no official word about it though. HOWEVER, I did ask the marketing coordinator and the social media manager there on media day for Calico about it and they both hilarious replied with like ""we have no idea about it"" but with an expression on their face of like ""shiz, they've caught us and know about what's coming"" kind of look lol So, yeah maybe something will happen there next!"

Themepark,28atdi,toys2men,1 point,Mon Jun 16 18:36:12 2014 UTC,"A bit light on pictures of the rides themselves...  That said, nice they've put effort into the kiddies land. Just a shame the physical location of this is on the opposite side of the park to most of the rollercoasters so mum/dad can't take their small child around it whilst everyone else queues for the big rides."
Themepark,289j6j,peanutismint,3,Mon Jun 16 07:46:36 2014 UTC,"Last time I was there (early April) yes, they wouldn't let you stow personal items on the side of the station. (Bullshit, really). Other Six Flags I've been to since then didn't seem to mind it...  Start with Full Throttle, X2, then Tatsu. Those lines fill up the quickest. Then take the path near Tatsu's entrance that goes up the hill. Ride Superman, skip Ninja for now (I've never seen it with a long line). Head to Goliath, then just work your way back with Scream, Batman, Riddler, Apocalypse, Ninja, Viper, Revolution. (Skip Green Lantern, honestly. It's just... Not fun. I mean if you really want to then sure but I hated it).   The flow of the crowd tends to be the X2 side in the early day, then Goliath and Scream later.   I've never purchased a flash pass but I've also never been there in the middle of summer. Really if you show up early enough to score an early ride on Full Throttle then hustle to X2, I think you'll be fine (you're also going on a weekday!)"
Themepark,289j6j,SethRader,2,Mon Jun 16 12:57:28 2014 UTC,"I'm going to have to completely disagree with skipping Green Lantern.  You either love it or you hate it, but I don't think saying that it's ""not fun"" is very useful.  Green Lantern is one of my favorite rides.  I recommend that OP watch a couple of youtube vids to see if it's something he may enjoy."
Themepark,289j6j,spork3,0,Mon Jun 16 15:11:06 2014 UTC,"Well I echo a couple youtube videos. I just found most of the ride, especially the ending, abrupt and jerky and like a crummy version of x2."
Themepark,289j6j,SethRader,2,Mon Jun 16 16:34:16 2014 UTC,As for stowing items on the side it all depends on who is working that day so you just have to hope you get lucky.
Themepark,289j6j,TheEdge7896,1 point,Mon Jun 16 16:07:51 2014 UTC,"Thanks for the tips! We found most rides were fine with leaving stuff on the side, but we managed to not take a bag and just carried stuff in our pockets. The only one we had trouble on was X2 where the girl said that locker use (at $1 per shot) was mandatory so we said we would use a locker but instead just hid our drinks bottle and hats around the side....  We did Full Throttle first (on in about 15 mins!) and then worked anticlockwise - the park was pretty quiet. Lots of rides were walk-ons! We did skip Green Lantern as I've done it before and didn't really enjoy it. Thanks for the tips!"
Themepark,289j6j,SethRader,1 point,Tue Jun 17 15:41:18 2014 UTC,Aw good! So glad you guys had a good experience!   Hope you got the back car on Full Throttle. My first ride ever was in the very back... The hangtime on both reverse launch and the vertical loop was mindblowing.
Themepark,289j6j,maxfoo2,2,Tue Jun 17 16:02:54 2014 UTC,"YES, DAT HANGTIME! My buddy and I both commented on it first thing when we got off.  There was a point there at the top of the loop where you were going so slowly you actually had enough time to stop and think 'huh, this loop sure is taking a long time.....'  We went on it again last thing once the sun had set. Watching the Santa Clarita lights slowly coming into view upside down was something I won't forget in a hurry!"
Themepark,289j6j,andrsg,1 point,Wed Jun 18 06:11:00 2014 UTC,"I went to great adventure a couple weeks ago.  The flash pass is very good if you want to do the major rides (roller coasters or rides that are very popular)  The flash pass doesn't cover everything, but if you are willing to go on those rides it is a very good choice.  (ps. Sometimes the wait times don't get uploaded to date and you can get on early.  I got on an hour long wait ride in ten minutes)"
Themepark,289j6j,bchris24,1 point,Mon Jun 16 13:30:12 2014 UTC,"I went less then a month ago and I was able to put all my bags on the side.  They can't make you buy a locker without letting you place it somewhere as long as you acknowledge that they take no responsibility for lost or stolen articles. As for the flash pass.  It's a weekday you shouldn't need it and be  able to get on all the rides.  I recommend you start with X2 since it is one most thrilling and constently longest wait. Just make sure you hit the other big rides that day which are tatsu, superman,drop of Doom, scream, Goliath, and full throttle."
Themepark,286gf2,JobaccaWookiee,4,Sun Jun 15 03:46:59 2014 UTC,Please just do SOMETHING with that side of the park.
Themepark,286gf2,brainbattery,4,Sun Jun 15 05:22:26 2014 UTC,"They are in no need of good ideas on what to do. EPCOT is horribly dated and has many empty building, MK took 4 years to complete a kiddie coaster, and Avatr land already feels dated and it isn't even done. What is the will to spend money to realize some of those ideas and try to up what Universal is doing?   I would love to see a SW land. I just left HS an hour ago and the love of Star Wars was evident in how many people were there for the final SW weekend."
Themepark,286gf2,Ofreo,4,Mon Jun 16 01:40:29 2014 UTC,"Its so weird to think about how much empty/unrealized space Disney has. They even have a ton of unused land outside the parks. I hope that Harry Potter proves to be the kick in the ass Disney needs to start some major construction,but a lot of Disney fans get PISSED if you even suggest this. I love Disney,but they really need to step-up their game."
Themepark,286gf2,Lilusa,3,Mon Jun 16 04:58:42 2014 UTC,I went to epcot recently and was so bored.  Mission space is awesome but i hate that they got rid of the future dioramas in spaceship earth.  Pretty much the only value i saw was doing something like drink around the world.
Themepark,286gf2,asha1985,3,Mon Jun 16 04:03:15 2014 UTC,"I think they'd be more likely to keep the Stunt Show while removing MuppetVision, Pizza Planet, and Mama Melrose.  I think that gives you room for another Star Wars attraction and maybe a food option or two.  Plus a greatly expanded shopping area, of course."
Themepark,286gf2,asha1985,4,Sun Jun 15 12:27:54 2014 UTC,"I've heard thats a possible plan as well...although I would hate to see Muppets go(although again....its super-dated...but fun). As much as I love Hollywood studios,its amazing how much of it is out of date and could easily go. The backlot tour really serves no purpose anymore(although the movie props/vehicles are cool). American Idol,Sounds Dangerous,The Stunt Show....heck I've even heard that they are thinking of removing the Chinese Theater and The Great Movie Ride(which again...fun ride,but way out of date). I loved Hollywood Studios because of its ""Classic Hollywood"" theme,but the park seems to have gotten away from that in recent years and as such will probably be getting a makeover from top to bottom. My bet is that within the next 10-15 years it just slowly turns into the Star Wars and Pixar park."

Themepark,27xwwz,grnmon,3,Thu Jun 12 05:07:41 2014 UTC,What do you think this means? That the attraction won't be open during the halloween period or that the whole attraction won't be open by then? I wonder why they'd shut it off if the first. Maybe to reduce already-big traffic.
Themepark,27xwwz,Aspexia182,6,Thu Jun 12 06:17:25 2014 UTC,"The whole London area would be shut down during the event at night, I assume, but open during the day.   Warner Brothers likely put stipulations in the contracts negotiating with Universal that prevents Universal from altering or adding to the area without the approval of Warner Brothers, including holiday aesthetics.  Warner Brothers might view Harry Potter as a family franchise, but Halloween Horror Nights is definitely not family oriented.  Maybe negotiations can be made to open Harry Potter during Halloween Horror Nights, but I think it's unlikely.  P.S.-The ride is expected to open within a month"

I'm assuming if it does open traffic and crowding will be cray-z."
Themepark,27xwwz,lauuuuura,1 point,Thu Jun 12 11:40:39 2014 UTC,"You are correct. Crowds for Hogwarts & Hogsmeade were insane every day for about a year after it opened.

Themepark,27xwwz,ashella,1 point,Thu Jun 12 15:38:47 2014 UTC,Has anyone confirmed if the Harry Potter attractions will be opened during the day? I was hoping to visit during October and this would absolutely be a deal breaker.
Themepark,27xwwz,Pseybert,2,Fri Jul 4 14:54:04 2014 UTC,"I'm %95 sure it will be open during the day, just not decorated for Halloween. Other than legal complications with Warner Bros/JK Rowling, they probably don't want to hire buckets of staff to operate the section from 6pm - 2am."
Themepark,27xwwz,Pseybert,1 point,Fri Jul 4 16:00:52 2014 UTC,Awesome. I really can't see why they would shut down both attractions during the day anyways - especially considering how new Diagon Alley is to the theme park. Thanks for the help!
Themepark,27xwwz,Pseybert,2,Fri Jul 4 17:28:58 2014 UTC,Good. HHN is crowded enough without people buying this cheaper ticket just to be able to see the new Harry Potter area.
Themepark,27xwwz,MaFratelli,2,Thu Jun 12 19:10:46 2014 UTC,"Yeah, but I can see tons of people going to HHN anyways and not reading the website, and they'll be pissed because Diagon Alley won't be open"
Themepark,27xwwz,farquaadhnchmn,3,Thu Jun 12 19:21:24 2014 UTC,The reason for this is that J.K. Rowling wants nothing to do with the event.  This is also the reason why the event stopped being held at IOA around the time Hogsmeade opened.  This is the only reason.  Edit: Please continue to downvote me. It is the truth; this is a call made by JK.  She doesn't want the brand associated with horror.   Are you people aware of how picky she is? She doesn't even allow Coke products in the land.
Themepark,27xwwz,dawnerd,2,Thu Jun 12 18:48:50 2014 UTC,"I've heard mixed statements, some saying the author is against it, others saying J.K. Rowling supports it but Warner Brothers is against it.  Mostly it's all hearsay"
Themepark,27wvio,_Ollie,2,Wed Jun 11 21:52:04 2014 UTC,"It will not be as busy as Disney or Universal.  There will probably be lines for the longer rides, but with a fastpass you are all set.  You probably could have gone without the fastpass at all but that will make it more comfortable.  Bring your walking shoes, the park is much bigger than it looks.

Themepark,27wvio,amsterdaam,2,Wed Jun 11 22:40:19 2014 UTC,"I don't know if the pass allows you to eat anywhere, but if you can I recommend the Zambia Smokehouse (actually under Shiekra) for some really good BBQ that doesn't taste like it came from a theme park.  The newly renovated and upgraded Pantopia area, which houses the Pantopia Grill and a place that does a million things with a pretzel.  (Try the pretzel bacon fury!).  I believe the only breakfast location in the park is the Zagora Cafe in the front of the park.   The food deal is great though, you can eat as much as you want."

TouringPlans.com and the Lines app reported crowd levels of 1-2 (out of 10) some days of our stay. It was more like 7-8, according to just about everybody on the app. We were there for four days and the only kiddie rides we got on were Snow White (5 min wait in the evening) and Storybook Land Canal Boats (45 min wait midday). We missed Mr. Toad, Peter Pan, and all the other ones we wanted to do. (We're adults, but we like those.) We were visiting from the east coast and it wasn't the experience we were expecting - nor the one we've had at Disneyland before.

Themepark,27eawy,asha1985,1 point,Sat Jun 7 18:14:40 2014 UTC,I'm talking about the resort as a whole. Most people buy hopper passes and hop between parks. I've had an AP for the last 3 years... and it's been getting crazier and crazier. There is no slow time anymore.
Themepark,27eawy,scuczu,0,Sun Jun 8 02:49:29 2014 UTC,"They should limit sales instead of raise prices. Its very convenient for them to raise prices and use the ""lol attendance"" excuse. They can create a rolling wait list for passes, with priority for guests who had one last year. There are just so many alternatives to raising prices."
Themepark,27eawy,Dystopeuh,3,Sun Jun 8 06:12:13 2014 UTC,"That's not how supply and demand works.  Pus, it makes for very angry consumers willing to spend money.  There's nothing worse than telling a consumer that you refuse to allow them to purchase a good or service."
Themepark,27eawy,Dystopeuh,-1,Fri Jun 6 06:13:45 2014 UTC,So as long as poorer people aren't trying to enjoy Disneyland as well then you're cool with it? Must be nice to be that rich.
Themepark,27eawy,Xenochrist,3,Fri Jun 6 12:44:36 2014 UTC,"I have a better idea.  Cap attendance. Only so many people will be admitted to the park at a time. This also encourages people to stay in the park longer (and eat there all day). Passholders can only make up a certain percentage of admitted guests in a day, resort guests have first dibs on park entrance.  There."
Themepark,27eawy,Dystopeuh,3,Fri Jun 6 14:43:50 2014 UTC,"Indeed a good idea, but what do you do with the people who have made trips from out of town... you could presage tickets for Certain days... then you have the issue of Park Hopper passes between Disneyland and Disney California Adventure. I like the idea  but think it would be a PR and logistical nightmare."
Themepark,27eawy,dawnerd,3,Fri Jun 6 04:52:12 2014 UTC,"Can only buy tickets in advance. Passholders must go through the same system of reserving a space, and if they don't show up that day, they're charged a fee. Absolutely no walk-ups. Get rid of the ticket booths in the middle (don't need them, no walk ups!), and join the parks in that area. No more park hopper tickets - only one ticket. Could have a neither here nor there feel in the middle with additional shops, small attractions, maybe a museum that shows the entire history of Disney."

Themepark,27eawy,Paimun,3,Fri Jun 6 15:20:29 2014 UTC,"They have an upper limit safety cap because of fire regulations. They don't actually reach max capacity very often.  I'm suggesting a park enjoyability cap. If you're waiting an hour to get a Dole Whip... you're probably not having a good time. (Yes, I have waited an hour before)."
Themepark,27eawy,Paimun,2,Fri Jun 6 05:46:40 2014 UTC,Disney cares more about heads in the park vs how much you enjoy it. If they can squeeze 100 bucks a person and you just stand in lines all day they make bank. There's also a very high chance that instead of standing in line you go and head at a sit down place and browse the shops. If it would be more profitable for them to have less people in the park they would have done something about it already.  The real solution would be to get rid of annual passes altogether.
Themepark,27eawy,Paimun,1 point,Fri Jun 6 05:49:59 2014 UTC,"I know you're right, but I'm arguing against the article that says they're trying to make it so fewer people are there by raising the prices. That's a stupid way to do it, because as we all know: raising prices won't prevent people from going."
Themepark,27eawy,DrMambo85,1 point,Fri Jun 6 06:09:31 2014 UTC,"Then it's a win/win for Disney right?    Not allowing people to purchase tickets is not a winning strategy, though.  You only change the attendance from people who can afford it to people who have contacts and can get tickets early."
Themepark,27eawy,Dystopeuh,-3,Fri Jun 6 06:26:48 2014 UTC,"I love how people have swallowed the pixie dust and they're happily accepting that Disney is trying to price their own fans out of the parks they love. Keep making excuses for the rising prices and lack of added capacity to deal with the crowds, it makes the choice to go to Tokyo Disney Sea at $60 a day much easier."
Themepark,27eawy,skyismad,8,Fri Jun 6 12:46:41 2014 UTC,"Have you ever been to Disneyland? Where would the extra capacity come from? They already tore out their parking lot to build California Adventure.  Now they have people parks miles away and bus or tram them in...  There is no more capacity. Every Disney park built since 1955 have always had the immediate land around the park purchased as well too allow for expansion. Unfortunately in 1955 no one knew how popular the Disneyland Resort would be.  And I don't think they are trying to price there own fans out of  the park. I believe they are trying to make it a destination for tourists not locals. All of there attempts in controlling the crowds have been aimed at SoCal locals, even going as far as discontinuing their special pass."
Themepark,27eawy,Paimun,-3,Thu Jun 5 21:39:40 2014 UTC,"You can maybe make that excuse for Disneyland but Disney World has PLENTY of room to build and they're barely doing that there.  Also yes, I have been to Disneyland, last year actually. Wonderful place. Just frustrating to see it cost more every year without anything new to justify the increase. There's a lot of empty spaces and rides that have been closed for years at Disneyland (especially in Tomorrowland) and that would at least help a little bit with the crowds."

Themepark,27e821,rollerGhoster,2,Thu Jun 5 16:49:21 2014 UTC,"You are doing Magic Mountain a major disservice by trying to get them to keep Colossus. Here's the thing, while you may think it's as simple as leaving it there, it's not. Leaving it there would cost Magic Mountain huge sums of money, money that they would not likely get from an increase of sales.  As it stands right now, Magic Mountain is losing huge sums of money to the constant up-keep of the ride, fixing it every-time it breaks (multiple times in a day), and operators to run the ride. All this, for a ride that doesn't really attract many riders. Most of the time the cars aren't even full, and they don't even run one of the tracks half of the time.  If they were to pay someone to come in and renovate the ride, there would need to be some serious restructuring of the layout, supports, tracks, trains, etc. And even then, chances are very likely that these renovations wouldn't increase ticket sales at all. People would come, ride it, realize it's the same coaster as before (just smoother), and then probably never ride it again. You would basically just need to tear down the whole ride and rebuild it to bring it to anything like what the Texas Giant or Iron Rattler bring in crowd wise, which completely devoids the whole purpose of keeping it around for historical value.  Sadly, the only way that Magic Mountain can make a profit off of it, is to remove it and place in a new ride that will attract a larger crowd of visitors. Forcing them to keep the ride is only going to hurt them in the long run."
Themepark,27cygm,dragonitetrainer,5,Thu Jun 5 05:19:41 2014 UTC,"Have you tried rationalizing to yourself that you were never really in any danger? Not one person has ever died on a Cedar Point ride. The ride vehicles are actually the safest vehicles you will ever ride in. In fact you were thousands of times more likely to be hurt on your way TO the park than by any ride AT the park. Also many of the few deaths that have occurred on theme park rides at other parks were due to pre-existing health conditions that the victims had. If you are a healthy adult, within all the ride height/weight requirements, and follow all the rules and directions of the ride you are extremely safe."
Themepark,27cygm,evilbunnys,2,Thu Jun 5 06:34:52 2014 UTC,"I know that I was safe and wouldn't actually die, but the feeling of possible death didn't give me a rush of adrenaline like it does to others. That's why even if I'm simply in a tall building, I can't look through a window. Sure, I know I won't die, but the feeling of it still makes me nervous."
Themepark,27cygm,evilbunnys,1 point,Thu Jun 5 12:24:48 2014 UTC,"I see. Well I would try going on some gentler rides first next time and maybe some of the flat rides that don't take you too far up. As the other commenter here said, maXair isn't usually one for the beginners. Cedar Point has a number-based intensity rating system for rides on their website and park maps. In the end, amusement park rides might just not be your thing. I would definitely give them at least another try though."
Themepark,27cygm,nomoslowmoyohomo,3,Thu Jun 5 23:04:25 2014 UTC,"It sounds like you went too big too soon. Roller coasters are big, fast, and to someone who has never been on one, unpredictable. Maxair was probably a bad first major ride too. Besides the height, it has some intense g- forces and the spinning is disorienting which only makes you feel more out of control. You would be better off starting with a family style ride.    Mine- Trains are great mid-level low thrill roller coasters. And Cedar Point has a great one called Cedar Creek Mine Ride. Smooth steel track, nothing really unexpected.    I've been obsessed with roller coaster and theme park stuff since i was a kid, but I was always too afraid to ride anything when we'd go to a park. One day I was somewhat forced/talked in to riding one and couldn't believe I'd been too afraid. It just takes baby steps. The things I used to hate about rides, height, speed, loops, that feeling in your stomach, are all things I look forward to now.    And remember, roller coasters and rides are some of the safest things in the world. They are checked daily for maintenance issues. Tested, and monitored by computers and engineers constantly. Anything is off and the ride is shut down. Most accidents at theme parks are caused by rider error, like trying to stand up or remove restraints or sticking body parts out of the car. These places have to entertain millions of people a year and really don't want to deal with the cost and press that comes from an injury.. and plus heavy safety regulation and legal fees. It's in everyone's best interest to make sure you're safe.    Edit: POV of Cedar Creek"
Themepark,27cygm,Pseybert,1 point,Thu Jun 5 10:19:47 2014 UTC,"Max-Air was perhaps the worst thing you could have ridden, period.  I travel the world and ride coasters, and rides like Max-Air still make me uneasy.    You're missed out."

The themeing around the ride is in decay and what you can see of the coaster (like most in the park) looks under-maintained and neglected.

It rides better than it did in 1979. The Vortex needs paint and is a bit rough admittedly but it will be dismantled in less than five years i bet. The Bat just got a new paint job this year and several track fixes so it's like new again. The Racer had lots of track work in 2013 also, it just needs a paint job. Stunt Coaster is fine, just no splash down anymore. Adventure Express is always the same, a bit rough with a dumb ending. I bet you think Banshee looks old and worn out too?"

It's also what we as team members can use on an individual basis to accommodate people who have trouble standing for long periods of time. There's also an elevator for wheel chairs over in that general corner. The only others, outside of ADA passes and castle tours, along with people we send under our discretion, are people with special passes that were given to them due to a downtime or evacuation.

We got upgraded to concierge for FREE at Hard Rock.   You also get one hour early entry into HP. Trust me this is WORTH IT. HP gets incredibly crowded by afternoon, early entry lets you do a few things with hardly any wait and experience all the small fantastic details in Hogsmeadge without people wall to wall crowding against you.  Our strategy was get in early, immediately get in line to do Ollivanders as the line for that can exceed an hour or more mid day. It's also a quick show so we knew it wouldnt take up much time nor would we be willing to wait an hour for it. After that, directly on to FJ and bam, we knocked out the two things that have no Express Pass in HP before the park even opens to regular guests."

Themepark,26za43,nerdalicious85,1 point,Sun Jun 1 16:48:48 2014 UTC,"Because Cabana Bay is considerably cheaper, and is advertised as a value/moderate where the Loews hotels (Hard Rock, Portofino, and Royal Pacific) are high deluxe. Cabana Bay ranges from 119 - 194 between low and high season, where the Loews Resorts range from 300-424. You can occasionally catch a Loews Resort around 230-260 during extreme low season (September - October, early December) but that's about it.  Or, you could befriend a UO TM and get a Loews Resort for 50 a night."

We go there on vacation once every year or two. Can't get enough, just love UO/IoA. Probably going back next year once the HP expansion calms down a little. But yeah, we paid quite a hefty price even going in December, way more than I ever spent on a hotel before. IMO it was still worth it even with the high price tag."

If you have the money DO IT. Lines will be at 120-90min waits, this means you'll be in extended queues which are outside in the blistering heat.  Prices vary based on attendance but will hold steady at the price of admission ($110~) during the summer.

Themepark,26x2wi,mattposts,6,Sat May 31 04:02:31 2014 UTC,"Notable exception: Men in Black.   Men in Black has the quickest, most efficient Single Rider line on the property.   Mummy is hit or miss. Sometimes it's gold, sometimes it's backed up a little.   Transformers is hit or miss as well.   Do NOT use the Single Rider line on Rip Ride Rockit unless it is very, very, very, very, very, very, very short. The line can be very deceptive and move INCREDIBLY slowly. I don't have Express but I do have an annual pass but the few times when I do want to ride RRR I will usually use the regular line even though I'm by myself.   Hulk, if it's not the first or last hour of the day, use the Express line."

I believe Kings Island has early entry for passholders  so unless you're part of that group there's going to be a considerable line before you even get in the park.  It's got good capacity though and is a great night ride so don't be afraid to wait.  If I was going to KI on a Saturday for the first time and wanted to ride everything, my strategy would be Firehawk and FoF first due to the low capacity and slow moving lines.  From there you could ride Windseeker, Vortex, Stunt Coaster, Beast, and Diamondback all in the first couple hours before it gets too busy.  YMMV.    Have fun!"

Themepark,26t57v,skwigger,4,Thu May 29 21:03:49 2014 UTC,"The money you'll save on tickets going to Busch Gardens will be spent on gas to/from Tampa.  Animal Kingdom is are really awesome park. I love the Maharajah Jungle Trek, Kilimanjaro Safari, and Affection Section. The park is hot though, and there's little escape from the heat. Where most parks have a lot of indoor stores and rides to bathe in AC, Animal Kingdom is really lacking."
Themepark,26t57v,johnnyhala,1 point,Thu May 29 19:22:00 2014 UTC,"Thanks for the response! Actually, there are free shuttles to Busch Gardens, its just the time wasted that gets me.

(""Mears Destination Services offers round trip motor coach transportation from several convenient Orlando area locations to Busch Gardens.    Transportation is complimentary with any purchased Busch Gardens admission ticket."")    Thanks for the thoughts on Animal Kingdom though. Yikes, didnt know about a lack of a space to cool down there. Still sounds like a lot of positives though.     We almost considered the $300~ safari at animal kingdom, because it sounded so cool. but it was just a passing momentary crazy thought - i dont think we'll do it since we have so much else we can see in 1 day."
Themepark,26t57v,MaFratelli,2,Thu May 29 21:02:22 2014 UTC,"I think the heat concerns for Animal Kingdom here are a little overstated. Yes, the majority of the park is outdoors, unlike, say, EPCOT, where so much is indoors.   However,   Animal Kingdom is very well landscaped, and you will be under tree cover/shade so much more of the day than you would at any other Disney Park. At Animal Kingdom you are seldom at the mercy of the sun like you would be at say, outside at Magic Kingdom, or outside at EPCOT."
Themepark,26t57v,studiopzp,4,Sat May 31 15:26:09 2014 UTC,"BGT is twice the park that AK is (certainly for a coaster fan), but if you are not into coasters it loses much of its appeal, particularly with the ride to tampa.  BGT has 4 world-class coasters: Sheikra, a B&M 200 foot drop coaster; Cheetah Hunt, an Intamin linear synchronous motor  coaster; Montu, a B&M inverted; and Kumba, a large B&M Steel coaster.  It also has a good wooden coaster (Gwazi).  There is a good river rapids ride, a log flume, and a water drop ride.  BGT is also a world-class zoo with the usual African plains exhibit plus excellent up-close tiger, hippo, and lion exhibits and also most of the great apes represented.  The cheetah run is fun to watch.  They also have a nice wallaby feeding exhibit, lorikeet feeding, and well landscaped bird gardens.  The safari ride, once top-notch, is now forgettable.  Show-wise there are some decent music shows, a bird show, and an excellent ice skating show.  The shows pale in comparison to Disney shows, except the ice show.  AK is still a half-day park even after 20 years.  Hopefully that is changing with the new expansion but it is not even close to complete.  AK has one top-notch safari ride (Kilimanjaro Safaris), one good ""mountain"" coaster (Expedition everest), a decent (but short) river rapids ride (Kali Rapids), and one decent dark ride (Dinosaur).  It has two excellent character-based shows: Nemo (a musical production) and Lion King (music and circus acts) and a cute little bird show.  The rest is zoo and filler.  The zoo is not as substantial as BGT but is wonderfully themed.  The Africa land is well themed, the Asia land is excellently themed, the dinosaur land is embarrasingly below the usual Disney standard.  If you are into animals, consider Discovery Cove, it is a wonderful place -basically more a day resort with marine life than a theme park.  You spend the day in the water swimming with reef fish, float the lazy river through aviaries, and there is a dolphin encounter (but it's an an upcharge).  It's pricey but all-inclusive with food and drinks (including beer)."

You can feed lories as they land all over you in an open aviary, pet and feed kangaroos, see Tigers and cheetahs up close. The Iceploration show is pretty neat too.  They also have special tours that cost a little extra where you can go out and feed giraffes, and such. I did the endangered animal tour for my birthday and loved it. We fed and pet giraffes from the back of a truck, saw a black rhino up close, and got really close to a cheetah while the handlers feed it meatballs.   They also have some of my favorite in park food at their BBQ place.  Between the parks you listed, I personally enjoy the animal attractions at Busch Gardens a bit more. No matter what place you go to, they all have plenty to offer those who don't do big rides."

The wand that is chosen from the ceremony is just one of the 8 or so different wands that you can buy from the store.

Themepark,26c2rh,ExactlyUnlikeTea,2,Sun May 25 03:08:13 2014 UTC,"Get there as early as you can, if that wasn't already a given. There are countless different ""strategies,"" one of which is to just rush when they open the gates to the back of the park in hopes of beating the lines back there. There's only so much you can do in terms of strategy. It's largely luck and good timing. As far as great non-coasters, Maxair, Skyhawk, Shoot the Rapids (water ride) are all a lot of fun. Personally I wasn't a huge fan of Gatekeeper so I wouldn't recommend making that ride a priority unless you really want to try it."
Themepark,26c2rh,ExactlyUnlikeTea,3,Sat May 24 03:01:24 2014 UTC,"Early was the plan.  It's less than 2 hours from where we are, and we're hitting the road by 7 AM, should give us plenty of time.  By the looks of things we're just rushing our priority coasters in order, likely Gatekeeper first since it's right there.  I've heard less than stellar things about it, but my dad and I still want to give it a shot, especially since we've never been on a coaster like it.  Maxair and Skyhawk are probable rides we'll check out otherwise, especially the former.  Hopefully, our timing will work out for everything.  Memorial Day weekend makes me nervous, but with all of the attention KI has received with Banshee's opening, I'm hoping maybe that will detract from the crowds coming in."

Tell the gate that's where you're headed and they'll direct you. This puts you in the back of the park by Magnum, Top Thrill and Maverick. Knock those out first. Everyone else is up front.   Gatekeeper, Raptor, Wicked Twister, Bluestreak are all up front and have long lines in the morning/early afternoon. At night though, those lines are dead. You should be able to walk onto Gatekeeper 2 hours before the park closes.  Lake Erie Eagles is a blast. It's always a longer wait then you would want for a flat, but worth it in my opinion.

I am a jaded coaster enthusiast, with zero kids and I don't think I've ever played a game in 14 years of visiting amusement parks as an enthusiast.  I have found games useless for many years (at every park, not just BGW). The hosts are loud and annoying (I understand they have to be, but it definitely doesn't make me want to play your game), and I've always thought they could be replaced by flat rides or some sort of other interactive experience. Not to mention I don't need a giant stuffed banana with a moustache and a sombrero that's twice as big as me.  Are they really big money makers for the park? Surely this is one relic from the past that could go away completely, and no one would notice."
Themepark,25yh3p,tabakers5,6,Mon May 19 19:51:56 2014 UTC,"We get paid 7.90 an hour, and we make about 400 for the park. It's a huge money maker."

Themepark,25wrhz,L15t3r0f5m3g,1 point,Mon May 19 02:26:37 2014 UTC,"Wow, I never knew Universal had such well done scenery. Almost Disney level, makes me want to go there."
Themepark,25wrhz,Theyellowk123,9,Mon May 19 07:38:23 2014 UTC,"The existing Harry Potter land is thematically superior to anything WDW has, and with Diagon Alley and the train about to open, it's going to a whole new level.  Universal has come a long, long way and is still putting big money into actual park improvements, and not just into upcharge opportunities.  Good for them.  We hadn't been in about 6-7 years until just recently, and were seriously impressed by Potter, Transformers, and the upgrades to the older stuff like Spiderman (still the best dark ride in Orlando) and the Simpsons land.  We bought APs and the kids prefer it now to Disney."
Themepark,25wrhz,MaFratelli,2,Mon May 19 14:40:55 2014 UTC,"I'm a Disney guy, but all of that has made me put IOA at the top of my list for places to go next. I'm especially interested in going to a park that not only has great theming/attractions/food, but also one that is interested in continually investing in building more and more.  Great pics, London is looking amazing."
Themepark,25wrhz,mortestmort,1 point,Mon May 19 23:29:00 2014 UTC,"We love Disney too; but I can't for the life of me understand their capital investments strategy.  2 billion dollars on sweaty rubber armbands.  There goes our 5th Florida gate down the toilet, which they could absolutely have filled with ease.  And the new resorts to fill the 5th gate.  I also have never understood the fanboyism that so many ""Disney people"" have that leads them to assume that the stuff up the road sucks without ever stepping foot into it.  If you even mention Uni on the damn Disney subreddits or dare to suggest the mouse has his flaws they shoot purple arrows at you like the Persian horde blotting out the sun over the Spartan 300.    But the proof is in the pudding and you see it.  Diagon Alley is looking incredible, and that London facade is just the front door.  And do check out IOA - for families with kids ages 6-7 and up it is for my money the best park in Orlando.  The two best dark rides in town (Spidey/Potter), the best themed land (Potter), the best in-park restaurant (Mythos), three solid B&M coasters, the best river rapids in town, fantastic theming, and frigging frozen butterbeer.  What are you waiting for?"
Themepark,25wrhz,MaFratelli,2,Tue May 20 02:39:50 2014 UTC,"Ugh, you're making me want to visit Universal even more.  That Disney fan mentality seems almost systemic, and is a really interesting and nefarious byproduct of the all-inclusive, never-leave-the-property strategy that has sustained Disney for so long. Hopefully there's a wake up call coming?  Although they've already had that -- DCA. I'm a California parks kinda person, and watching them invest a (measly) 1 billion into DCA, and seeing it resurrected from the joke it was, seems like a pretty clear model for successful parks management.  And the Persian horde thing? Yeah... that's why I stopped going to Disney forums a few years ago. I realized I was a fan of themed entertainment and not just a corporation that has grown corpulent and complacent."
Themepark,25wrhz,mortestmort,1 point,Wed May 21 01:39:22 2014 UTC,"You are dead on about the complacency.  And ironically, we have IOA itself to blame for it.  When it opened it was the most innovative and brilliantly themed park in Orlando.  It still is.  And yet, when it opened it made no dent whatsoever in Disney's numbers.  None.    TDO then introduced magic express and DDP to complete the mouse trap.  The suckers never leave the plantation now.  Disney fanboys are like the people trapped in the Matrix that take the blue pill and just stay in the box.  And they convince themselves that there is nothing else outside worth seeing.  Once the trap was complete, TDO set about on a strategy to milk the rubes as hard as possible with upcharges and merchandising while not increasing capacity or plussing attractions anymore.  Hence the rubber armbands (but good luck repaying the cost overruns).  Uni - sadly at first - had IOA, the prettiest girl in town, but she couldn't get a date.  Then JK Rowling came along and set her up.  Potter is a damn juggernaut.  4 years later and those shops and the Butterbeer stands are still packed to the gills.  And the expansion looks like it is going to blow away the original stuff.  So finally, IOA got some love, which it always deserved.  If we can just liberate a few more from the mouse trap, maybe IOA will finally surpass DHS and DAKs numbers, which are vastly inferior parks."
Themepark,25wrhz,MaFratelli,1 point,Wed May 21 05:26:07 2014 UTC,"What did they upgrade in Spiderman? It was exactly as I remembered it since the last time I rode it in '04.  Transformers was a pretty cool reskin of Spiderman, but I found the physical sets to be kinda lacking. Still a fun ride, if a little derivative. Definitely the best Transformers movie so far - five minutes of interactive action, which is all it needed to be."
Themepark,25wrhz,MaFratelli,2,Tue May 20 01:56:19 2014 UTC,"Spiderman was upgraded to 4k digital projection which made the effects pop even more.  The ride is the same; the film elements just look better.  As for Transformers, sure it uses the same ride system, but I don't see it as a ""reskin"" any more than Pirates of the Caribbean is a reskin of It's a Small World, or the Little Mermaid is a reskin of the Haunted Mansion.  I agree with you that the extra physical sets (and real fire!) put Spidey over the top.  But the kids prefer Transformers.  The one edge I will give Transformers is the fantastic meet and greet."
Themepark,25xohp,JustWordsInYourHead,1 point,Mon May 19 12:06:46 2014 UTC,"NJ is going to be bad.  Really bad.  I think that 2hr wait might be the case.  You can buy their Flashpass and jump the lines, but I'm pretty sure that's pretty expensive.  NJ's park isn't super far from some of the shore towns, and Memorial Day is terrifying in that part of the state.  Good luck to you.  (I'm a Jersey Girl, so I have no idea about MA's park!)"

Themepark,25xohp,laur2d2,2,Mon May 19 13:53:46 2014 UTC,"I absolutely agree.  My friends and I took off on a Monday and went to six flags one May, and we had the park practically to ourselves.  This time of year you may run into some school trips on Thursdays and Fridays.  Early in the week is probably best."

Themepark,25xohp,KingdaToro,1 point,Mon May 19 14:22:35 2014 UTC,"You're screwed with either park. Memorial Day weekend is one of the top three busiest times of year for any amusement park. It doesn't help that you're thinking of visiting the two that are closest to the largest metropolitan area in the country, as well as the most densely populated.   Postpone or brace yourself for pain."
Themepark,25tn2s,peanutismint,3,Sat May 17 22:47:31 2014 UTC,"You can only reserve one ride at a time and yes, you can wait in line for other rides at the same time. The reserve time is for either that time or after the ride, so say your time is 2:30 and you get there at 2:45 it's after that time so you will be fine. Have fun, it's one of my favorite parks! Oh and if you don't want to feel like your face was beaten don't go on the Viper!"
Themepark,25tn2s,gosalyn87,1 point,Sat May 17 23:01:45 2014 UTC,"Hahah feeling like you've gone ten rounds with Ali is part of the charm of older coasters! And even some newer ones, if I remember my experience with The Green Lantern from last time I went....  Ok cool, thanks for the tips. So is ANY length of time after your supposed 'ride time' okay to turn up? What if we were, say, 2 hrs late or something??  And is it really worth it if you can only reserve one ride at a time?? How many can you feasibly fit in, or is it best used for the more 'in demand' rides??"
Themepark,25tn2s,tealcandtrip,3,Mon May 19 10:47:41 2014 UTC,"You can get on the ride anytime after the original queue has passed.  So if you have a  queue for 2:45, you can use it a 3, 4, and even 10:30.  The only downside is you cannot reserve another ride until you have used or dismissed the 2:45 one.  You can have up to six people on one flash pass.  You can also buy passes that drastically reduce wait times.    The pass itself looks like a big tamogotchi.  You scan through a list of rides and their wait times.  Then you choose the one you want to reserve.  In a lot of ways it is better than the new or old disney fast pass.  I like it because you are no longer sprinting across the park to get a flash pass, you don't have to plan your day out ahead of time, and you can see all the wait times for all the rides at all times.  So you reserve the ones with longer waits and head for the ones with 5-10 minute waits.  I've had good and bad experiences with them in the past.  If the park is busy, they are great.  You can reserve times for the big rollercoasters across the park (without having to run across the park) and eat lunch or ride 2-3 smaller rides or shows during the wait.  No more staring at the ceiling for two hours for a two minute ride.  You can even rechoose the ride you are on so you can get back on right away sometimes.  If the park is slow, you feel a bit like a punk spending the extra money.  Depending on when you go, you may want wait until you get to the park to decide to buy one.  That way you get a sense of the crowds.  Of course then, you risk not being able to get one."
Themepark,25tn2s,tealcandtrip,1 point,Mon May 19 03:58:13 2014 UTC,"Do ride times update live on the device? If so, that's a cool feature. I think I will wait til the day to pick one up. Does that have cost implications?? And if so, is there any way of finding out how busy the park is before we go so we can buy cheaper online? We'll be there in mid-June....."
Themepark,25tn2s,vfrfreak23,2,Mon May 19 10:50:14 2014 UTC,"I'm 95% sure there is no difference in cost.  They only sell a certain number each day.  So if you get there and it starts getting busy 2-3 hours in, it may be too late to buy one.  Like I said, it is a risk.  The reservation times are on the device.  For the regular flash pass, that is the current wait time of the ride.  For gold, that is half the wait time.  For platinum, that is 90% of the wait time, so you can usually reserve when you get on a ride, then just walk on to the next one.  Check out their training video to see how it works."
Themepark,25tn2s,vfrfreak23,1 point,Mon May 19 13:19:59 2014 UTC,"Great info, thanks; that makes things a bit clearer."
Themepark,25tn2s,RollerCoasterMatt,2,Mon May 19 16:27:48 2014 UTC,"Hey there. To answer the first question, the times update periodically. I'm a ride operator and we get a phone call every 30 minutes to an hour asking how long the wait is. What we tell them is what they use to determine the time on the device."
Themepark,25tn2s,RollerCoasterMatt,1 point,Thu May 22 15:27:09 2014 UTC,Oh really? That's quite interesting. I didn't think it'd be quite that archaic a system. Figured they'd have motion sensors or something... So how do you operators know how long the queues are?
Themepark,25tn2s,yaminub,1 point,Thu May 22 21:59:02 2014 UTC,"We have points where we can gauge estimate how long the wait will be. Like if the line goes to the stairs it's 15 minutes or if it goes outside it's 45 minutes. Things like that. I believe Disneyland does somewhat of the same thing with the estimated wait time in the front but I'm not entirely sure. I was watching cast members and one asked another how long they thought the line was. When the other said, ""about an hour,"" the other team member changed the wait time in the front. There might be more complicated systems out there but it works for us.. somewhat."
Themepark,25tn2s,yaminub,2,Thu May 22 22:12:16 2014 UTC,don't get plat get gold all plat does is let you ride it twice and they want to make money off it that's why they don't have the simple ticket thing. Also they have a thing where they give you a gold band which you get an any ride without waiting but you got to be famous for it

Themepark,25qh1y,scottwalker88,5,Fri May 16 19:17:19 2014 UTC,"Beyond incredible, Universal is really setting the gold standard for theme parks right now."
Themepark,25qh1y,Paimun,3,Fri May 16 22:08:11 2014 UTC,"I agree. They're working to the high standard of disney if not better at times plus they're building rides at an incredible rate.   Transformers last year, Harry Potter extension this year. Possible rumours about King Kong next year and the improbable roller coaster between The Simpsons and Men in Black. Mean while Disney have taken 3 years to build the Seven Dwarfs coaster and there doesn't seem to be much excitement about Avatarland."
Themepark,25qh1y,Paimun,4,Fri May 16 22:37:18 2014 UTC,"Disney's standards are falling a lot (at least in the US) and Universal's has never been higher. It seems we're in for a lot of exciting attractions from them in the near future. I hope Avatarland is really groundbreaking because over the last few years my interest is waning a LOT in a return trip to WDW over a return trip to DL (or visiting, say, TDL for the first time). If I do go back to the Florida parks it'll probably because I'm in the neighborhood for Potter anyways."

Themepark,25nwfk,mortestmort,3,Mon May 19 23:19:00 2014 UTC,Maelstrom? NO. PLEASE NO. Epcot's been ruined by Disney characters enough already.
Themepark,25nwfk,x_minus_one,3,Fri May 16 03:56:34 2014 UTC,"Honestly it's a plausible rumor due to the state of the attraction and the demand for Frozen, however I think it would be a huge mistake. Maelstrom is a great ride with lots of classic appeal and nostalgia."
Themepark,25nwfk,RealNotFake,3,Fri May 16 18:59:20 2014 UTC,"Which is exactly what Disney likes to trample all over.  How about maybe ADD a ride instead of acting like everything has to be a replacement?  And Frozen is just a fad, by the time Disney gets around to opening a ride (remember how SDMT has taken four years to build?) nobody will care about it anymore."
Themepark,25nwfk,x_minus_one,2,Fri May 16 19:17:02 2014 UTC,They aren't going to do this. There is no reason to. What's more likely is to add a Frozen show at HS and a ride at MK in 5-10 years.
Themepark,25nwfk,tdt0005,2,Sat May 17 13:48:02 2014 UTC,"This ""article"" simply restates another speculative article posted on the same site...six days earlier. The earlier article is even linked in this one! Not worth the time."
Themepark,25nwfk,DragonBuddha,1 point,Fri May 16 09:57:53 2014 UTC,"Well yes, as the headline states these are rumors. Until the park makes an official announcement, this is all speculation based on unofficial sources. But some are all but confirmed by this point (Soarin' being the big one)."
Themepark,25nwfk,tdt0005,2,Fri May 16 20:27:38 2014 UTC,"This article is shit.   Soarin' will be updated, but it's nothing more than a new film. I doubt it would be closed very long at all.  Really doubt they will turn Maelstrom into a Frozen ride, I hope not at least. That just doesn't fit with Epcot at all. I love Frozen but I really hope this doesn't happen. A Frozen ride belongs at MK, or a show at DHS.  Great Movie Ride is outdated, but if anything they will just update it. It's not enough room for Star Wars land, so that idea is just stupid.   Epcot really needs to do something with the old wonder's of life pavilion. It's just sitting there empty. Same with the upstairs of the Imagination pavilion. Why would they close down rides when they've got plenty of room to add them?"
Themepark,25nwfk,DrMambo85,2,Sat May 17 13:51:26 2014 UTC,"Soarin' deserves to die. Good idea and ride system, horrible execution.  Hopefully the new film will have proper editing rather than the sudden jump cuts. Like, oh, I dunno, fly up into the clouds for a scene change rather than instantly teleporting hundreds of miles."
Themepark,25nwfk,RealNotFake,1 point,Fri May 16 01:47:11 2014 UTC,"I guess better cuts makes sense and everything, but coming down from the clouds each time into a totally different landscape would still be jarring.

Themepark,25nwfk,JobaccaWookiee,1 point,Fri May 16 19:04:03 2014 UTC,"Well...this is all just speculation,but I can BS with the best of them. First of all,I've heard that MALESTORM/FROZEN rumor from a couple of different places,so there might be something there. FROZEN is insanely popular....far more than Disney had ever even hoped. You better believe they're going to be adding something to the parks. Adding FROZEN to Epcot would surely boost that parks attendance numbers AND give kids something to do there....Epcot is probably the least kid-friendly of all the parks,so this would give them something to do while their parents are off getting drunk around the world.  Now...for Hollywood Studios. This is,and has been since opening,my favorite park. That being said,out of all the Florida parks,its the most outdated. The classic Hollywood theme was awesome when it first opened,but who is that going to appeal to today? Hell...I was a weird kid so I had watched tons of old movies and knew the characters,but kids today? Does the great movie ride really attract ANYONE under the age of 50? And it takes up a LOT of space. We know Star Wars land is coming to Hollywood Studios....and soon. And it will probably only be the first phase. Disney owns Star Wars now,so they will be building and adding SW stuff to the parks for years to come. On top of that,there is also the rumor/news that Carsland is coming to Hollywood Studios as well. Personally,I could care less about PIXAR,but THAT is what the kids today associate with Disney,so expect PIXAR to have a huge presence in the parks as well in the years to come.  One other thing....Marvel. Universal Studios has the theme park rights for Marvel characters east of the Mississippi. But Disney owns the entire Marvel universe. And they are going to keep making tons of Marvel cartoons and movies and every other park that Disney owns is going to have Marvel rides and show in the years ahead. Again....Marvel is going to be what a lot of people in the years ahead associate with Disney. It makes absolutely NO business sense for Universal to keep advertising Disney brands and Disney characters. I eventually see them phasing out all the Marvel rides at IOA and replacing them with other things....like they are currently doing with Harry Potter and Transformers and Fast and the Furious. Marvel is a dead-end for Universal at this point. It may take time,but I think it WILL happen sooner than later. I see a day far off in the future when Hollywood Studios is the park that features ALL of Disneys movie characters....Star Wars,Avengers,Indiana Jones,Pixar. I predict big changes for Hollywood Studios in the years ahead."
Themepark,25nwfk,TVsRobLowe,3,Sat May 17 16:03:30 2014 UTC,"Actually, both Disney and Universal are really happy about the current situation with the Marvel rights.  Disney gets 100% of the profits from Marvel merchandise sold at Universal, plus a portion of ticket sales. That's where the really money is.  It's Universal's responsibility to maintain the park, which is a huge operating expense that Disney doesn't have to deal with.  Universal, on the other hand, gets free advertising for characters in their park with every movie Disney releases.  Having Marvel rights wouldn't bring much more people to Disney than they already do, because most who come to Universal from out of state go to Disney as well, but not much who come to Disney go to Universal.  Also, Disney has taken an interest in keeping their brand looking good - Did you know that Disney costuming are the ones who designed the newer Marvel costumes at Universal?  Or that Walt Disney Animation did the new ride video for the Spider-Man ride?  I don't expect that situation to change for a long time."

Themepark,25fdq6,JoshAGoldman,1 point,Tue May 13 15:12:38 2014 UTC,"Also, keep in mind that theme parks sometimes have ""soft"" openings when they open new rides.  Often, they will let people into the new sections/rides a few days before the official opening date in order to work out some crowd control kinks/train ride operators.  No guarantee on that, though.  Good luck!"
Themepark,25fdq6,RyenDeckard,2,Tue May 13 15:14:14 2014 UTC,"Anyone else worried it's going to be a little too similar to Spiderman/Transformers?

Not that I don't love those two rides. They're two of my favorite in Universal... but is this just more of the same? Am I missing something?"

Themepark,25b4s1,CMVenom,1 point,Sun May 11 21:39:50 2014 UTC,Are they still considering this a wooden coaster?
Themepark,25b4s1,DLDude,1 point,Mon May 12 01:55:53 2014 UTC,Yes.  It's a wooden track with a steel topper.  Unlike the other RMC coasters which are all steel track with wooden supports.
Themepark,25b4s1,Hedgey,1 point,Mon May 12 15:11:51 2014 UTC,"Outlaw Run is also wood track with steel topper.  Texas Giant, Iron Rattler, and Medusa are all steel track."
Themepark,25b4s1,Omon,1 point,Mon May 12 19:04:50 2014 UTC,what is a topper?
Themepark,25b4s1,tdt0005,1 point,Tue May 13 01:59:24 2014 UTC,"It is a sheet of steel that goes on top of wooden track. You can see these on older wooden coasters, but these topper tracks by RMC are thicker so that the ride is smooth and the ability for the ride to do inversions."
Themepark,255262,FunkyHenryGale,1 point,Fri May 9 16:47:24 2014 UTC,I hope they have a passholders preview. I am guessing this will be an amazing experience.
Themepark,25551p,Walker4Life,4,Fri May 9 17:17:08 2014 UTC,"If you've never been on one of these, let me tell you that dropping out of one of those capsules is by far the weirdest feeling ever. There really isn't any other way to describe it. The only way to actually know what these shoes are like is to ride them."
Themepark,25551p,anyhistoricalfigure,2,Fri May 9 20:03:38 2014 UTC,That looks insane. Not my kind of ride but I'll need to try it at least once.
Themepark,25551p,scottwalker88,2,Fri May 9 19:32:26 2014 UTC,These are so much fun. They don't do a countdown at my local park they just drop you. Free falling is such an awesome sensation.
Themepark,25551p,cyberjedi,1 point,Fri May 9 20:25:12 2014 UTC,Gotta go try it. Watched it going up. Look tall.Sometimes those types of slides hurt even with your legs crossed. But I will try it once.
Themepark,25551p,Ofreo,2,Fri May 9 19:18:02 2014 UTC,"The went on the Orange one, and it was smooth. Really a nice slide. The funny thing about Ihu's is that the Purple slide (the one that doesn't have a breakaway box) is probably the most thrilling with the longest vertical drop. The Orange one is probably the second most thrilling... it has a steep vertical drop right at the start. And to tell you the truth, I was surprised how long the ride was.... I was expecting it to end, but it kept on going.... It's pretty up there."
Themepark,25551p,Inukaza,2,Fri May 9 23:05:40 2014 UTC,"I agree. I rode it a few weeks ago during employee previews. I actually thought the blue one was the most intense. I flipped over a few times during the switchback. Orange was my favorite, followed by purple and green."
Themepark,253m3b,517634,3,Fri May 9 03:24:35 2014 UTC,"I grew up going to King's Island every summer! For food, there are cheap places like McDonald's near the park, so you can always get your hand stamped and come back. If you want a true experience though, I suggest you pick up some pizza. It's a local staple, LaRosa's, and it's delicious. We always ate our at the restaurant near The Beast in Rivertown.   If you're looking for some more relaxing ride in between the big ones, The Viking ride almost never has a line. White Water Canyon is always great to go on and cool off too. The line can get pretty long, but it does move quickly.  For thrill rides, when you ride The Beast, make sure you sort of brace yourself after the second lift hill - that double helix can be a doozy. Firehawk is my favorite ride there, it's a blast, but you'll have to rent lockers for $2 beforehand as there is no place to stash your stuff.  There's a full waterpark that a part of the park, but if you have time there's a separate waterpark nearby called The Beach, which I think is better.  Have fun!"
Themepark,253m3b,lumoria,3,Fri May 9 12:27:20 2014 UTC,"My goodness, grew up 20 minutes south of Kings Island and have lost count how many times I've gone. One of the charms of Kings Island is its age - so there are a lot of classic architectural/landscaping features that you won't see elsewhere.  It USED to be owned by Paramount, which means most of the rides and pathways were movie-themed. Sadly though, that's now over; so while a LOT of rides SEEM like they should be from a movie, their theming is all but gone.  The initial entry into the park (fountain + tower) is beautiful and great for pictures, followed by one of those classic ""drive cars through a garden"" ride.  My favorites of course are the classic Beast, Flight of Fear (this ride used to be called Outer Limits when it opened and was a HUGE deal when it opened - Area 51-themed indoor coaster), Adventure Express is a classic (super cheesy now, Indiana Jones-like thing), Delerium is newer but incredibly awesome if you're not prone to motion sickness (no theming - just a crazy ride), the Vortex is KI's ""classic"" steel coaster and The Racer is really fun to go on at night (two racing coasters, one of the oldest existing wooden coasters).  None of the restaurants really stick out to me; but if you're new to the area's eats, make sure to try some LaRosa's pizza, Skyline Chili, and Graeter's Ice Cream. Man, now I'm jealous! Have a blast!"

Themepark,251vws,tits_hemingway,2,Fri May 9 02:53:39 2014 UTC,"the only caveat I have with the Hall of Presidents is that they can make the arm & hand gestures so lifelike, but his face is expressionless and doesn't look very much like Obama."
Themepark,251vws,grnmon,2,Fri May 9 03:14:19 2014 UTC,"Yeah, my guess would be that they prioritized the larger gestures because of the theatre venue. The Hall doesn't afford a lot of opportunities for guests to get really close. Or maybe it's just because it's harder/more expensive, especially getting the skin to move in a realistic, non-creepy way. This Lincoln head from last year has over twice the facial articulation than the current ""best"" animatronics in the current show, and has better skin."
Themepark,251vws,tits_hemingway,1 point,Fri May 9 03:30:40 2014 UTC,"This is going to be incredible. Universal is going to absolutely slam this one out of the park. Good luck with Avatar Land, DAK."

Themepark,24v7tu,sanford_and_sun,9,Tue May 6 14:44:38 2014 UTC,They could make an entire themepark out of all the material in the books.

Themepark,24v7tu,roj2323,5,Tue May 6 19:47:38 2014 UTC,"I've thought about this myself.   From a purely financial POV, they will make their money back way before it starts to be unpopular.   If all the rumours about the coaster are true, it will be a classic and will be the new universal flagship attraction."
Themepark,24v7tu,scottwalker88,3,Tue May 6 20:36:24 2014 UTC,"To be honest, Jaws had and still has a huge impact on me. I would have loved it if they rebuilt some of the animatronics but for one reason or another, they didn't. Getting away from the point though, HP will still be popular beyond its age.

Themepark,24jz9h,apollocrush,5,Fri May 2 17:02:31 2014 UTC,Are you waiting until the new London side is open? regardless. I would say you could easily. It's really only a small portion of IoA and even USO. However if you go around the London opening it will probably be really busy. The only thing right now I would say you might not get done is Olivander's. The line for that show has always been 1hr+ for me and I've skipped it every time. I can't stand out in the sun for that long to watch a kid get chosen by a wand.
Themepark,24jz9h,pandorazboxx,1 point,Fri May 2 17:32:19 2014 UTC,"I was going to go this weekend on a whim, but now I might wait til Diagon Alley is open."
Themepark,24jz9h,phantomganonftw,6,Fri May 2 18:06:57 2014 UTC,"I don't suggest waiting if you want to be able to do it in a day. The crowds after it opens are going to be heinous. I would go now for the park that's already open, then come back a few months to a year or two after the second park opens in order to get to actually spend time enjoying it. Otherwise you'll just spend the entire time waiting in lines."
Themepark,24jz9h,skwigger,2,Fri May 2 22:43:24 2014 UTC,"When the area first opened, there was literally a wait just to be able to walk around that area. I believe if the area was at capacity, you'd get some sort of voucher to come back later in the day. It was so crowded, it was near impossible to walk around in the stores. It's much better now, but expect it to be like that again when the new attraction opens."
Themepark,24jz9h,Fordx4,2,Fri May 2 18:15:40 2014 UTC,I would go now to have a good experience at the park with the understanding a new part will be waiting for you next time.  Its going to be crowded for the foreseeable future after London opens.
Themepark,24jz9h,amsterdaam,6,Fri May 2 18:41:14 2014 UTC,"I don't know if you know, but Harry Potter ""World"" is not a park.  The park is Islands of Adventure at Universal Studios.  It is one small section of that park.  You will be able to see all of the Hogsmeade in a few hours.  When Diagon Alley opens, it will open at the other park (Universal Studios) and you will have to have a park hopper ticket to see both."
Themepark,24jz9h,trisaratops1,3,Fri May 2 21:48:50 2014 UTC,"It depends on the time of year! If you are thinking soon like the next couple weeks this is a great time to go, especially on a weekday. Kids are still in school and a lot of people are waiting until Diagon Alley opens to visit the parks. It sounds like they are going to continue adding things to Diagon Alley so if you just went to Hogsmeade now, in the future you could see the other one and it would probably have more features than when it opens. Definitely don't go over the summer. You could wait until the fall--it shouldn't be crowded on weekdays from September to mid-December. You would want to get a two-park ticket, though, to see both Hogsmeade and Diagon Alley, which is a little more expensive. If you only care about HP you can easily do it in one day, but if you are interested in the other things at the parks it's hard to do both parks in one day even when it's not crowded. If you like HP though you should definitely go! The Hogwarts ride is amazing and they really put in a lot of little details everywhere that make it very worth it."
Themepark,24jz9h,phantomganonftw,2,Fri May 2 19:27:14 2014 UTC,"This is good advice. You should follow it. But, if you decide to ignore this advice and go during the summer, go on a Tuesday, Wednesday, or Thursday (Tuesdays seem to be the best). People who come for a short vacation usually take the days next to the weekends off from work so that they can minimize the days off work and maximize the time spent here. Also, locals still work, so they're more likely to go on the weekend. If you come on a day that it's predicted to be rainy the park will be less crowded, but you might have to deal with walking around the park in the rain (and some coasters close during the rain). So you have to decide if that trade-off is worth it."
Themepark,24jz9h,CurbYourNewUrbanism,3,Fri May 2 22:47:52 2014 UTC,Early September is pretty amazing at all of the Florida parks.
Themepark,24jz9h,SaucyCat,2,Fri May 2 20:03:17 2014 UTC,"I second this. Locals are back in school and the holiday is ending for Europe. My mom and I went to WWoHP the September after it opened. They still had the queues up to enter the area and the stores, but we walked right through them. As for the attractions, we waited 30 minutes or less for everything but Olivander's."
Themepark,24jz9h,dawnerd,0,Fri May 2 20:35:12 2014 UTC,Even better if you go first or second weekend of Halloween horror nights at USO. Went last year and both parks were dead. 5 minute wait for forbidden journey.

Themepark,24ezoy,neon,1 point,Fri May 2 04:12:47 2014 UTC,"Based on what I read before, it's going to use some of the tech that Th13rteen or Verbolten use for a drop but that's still all rumors too. If it's the case, this could be one of the best coasters around."

Themepark,24ezoy,Kotakia,3,Sat May 3 21:48:13 2014 UTC,"I approve of this move by Disney.  It's gotten to the point where one goes to the Disney parks for the environment/scenery more so than the thrill rides. Although this ride does not appear to be too intense or thrill driven, it looks as if they nailed the theme and is quite stunning appearance wise.   I just recently visited the Disney parks in Orlando again and was blown away by the pure beauty that can be seen inside those parks through the foliage and theme.  That being said,  I am super excited for this ride and Diagon alley! and am looking forward to checking them both out."
Themepark,24ezoy,SubClavianGroove,3,Thu May 1 15:40:52 2014 UTC,The entire Harry Potter expansion puts this to shame in theming/scenery as well though.  As does from everything I have seen so far the new expansion

Themepark,247rr1,scottwalker88,1 point,Tue Apr 29 08:49:11 2014 UTC,"There's a jump cut right at the moment it drops. Watch the train appear on the track on frame right, and the cloud cover exposure shift.   Having done about 20+ drops on SFMM's Lex Luthor, this seems relevant to my interests. Bummer they didn't go for a record height, but the rotating seats looks pretty tasty."
Themepark,247rr1,CouchOtter,6,Tue Apr 29 09:06:46 2014 UTC,"300 ft is still pretty good compared to the mid 90's early 00's drop towers. Plus I think cost wise the only reason Lex Luthor and Zumanjaro were feasable is because the towers already existed. I mean, look at how much steel Falcon's Fury uses!"

Themepark,247rr1,HerpDerpinAtWork,1 point,Tue Apr 29 19:27:00 2014 UTC,I think for a while newly installed drop towers start slowing down higher up. Then they adjust the breaking to make it more thrilling.

Themepark,243dbe,Stats_,5,Sun Apr 27 08:30:18 2014 UTC,"It is the school holidays, but since there are 6 weeks of holidays, visits tend to be spread out more than say, Easter for example, which is far busier than the summer holidays. Monday is a good choice of day during the summer holidays.  I never normally buy a fastpass, and can manage all the main attractions, even on a busy day, with good planning. If you can afford a pass though, it will probably enhance your day and make it easier to fit in all the attractions. Especially as it sounds like this is a first time visit for you.  I checked out the two possible passes that are £11, which are ""Accelerator Fastrack"" and ""Extreme Fastrack"".  Extreme: I think you should not bother with ""Extreme Fastrack""... Colossus and Nemesis Inferno are two of the older roller coasters (not that they are bad, just not ""hot"" attractions), and have a good capacity meaning the queues move fast. The other attractions included with it are not worth getting a fastpass for.  Accelerator: This is much better value, as it covers Stealth, which will likely have a queue at least 30mins, maybe even over an hour if it is busy. Also the supporting non-coaster attractions included are very popular, and can attract sizable queues on a busy day.  Full Throttle (£20): Thought I would mention this, as it is the best fastpass option, but almost twice as much. It covers all the major rollercoasters, which are the headline attractions at Thorpe Park, and will have the largest queues. If you buy this, your day really will be very easy indeed.  By far the largest queue will be found for SAW, due to it's very poor capacity (only 8 passengers per train) and popularity. It is also a miserable queue line to spend time in as it is very crowded and confined with no shade on a hot day. Also The Swarm as the newest major attraction will likely attract a big queue, but its high capacity will mean it clears out quickly, meaning you can sometimes find a short queue around midday (about 11:30am-1pm.... visually look at the queue.... it might still say its 90mins from the morning peak, but actually, it has shrunk a lot since the information board was last updated).  If you can, get to the park at opening time, and head straight to SAW. The majority of park guests will head to The Swarm, as it is the newest attraction, meaning the Swarm queue will be at its longest at the start of the day. After Saw, ride Colossus, Nemesis Inferno and Stealth. Leave The Swarm for later, after the early morning queues have died down (but before everyone else in the park catches on that the queue has got shorter since the morning peak). Queues for the coasters tend to peak in the mid-morning, get shorter around lunchtime, and then build up again from about 2pm onwards.  If you can get the coasters done quickly (which have the largest queues), you will then be able to enjoy taking your time riding the supporting attractions, and hopefully have some time for re-rides on your favorite coasters in the afternoon.  Advertised queue times are normally exaggerated to help sell more fast passes, and you will actually queue much shorter than what it says.  Coaster queues:  -120mins = actually 60-90mins  -90mins = actually 60mins  -60mins = actually 30-45mins  -45mins = less than 30mins  If the queue time says its less than 30mins, then it is probably about right.  Oh yeah, the park is very small, with a lot crammed in, so you can walk between any of the attractions in about 5 minutes. No need to walk around in any particular order =)"

Themepark,243dbe,peanutismint,1 point,Mon Apr 28 18:33:51 2014 UTC,I'd say if you can afford it then do it. August is slap bang in the middle of school holidays so it's reasonably likely that the park will be reasonably busy and full of kids/families. It was pretty busy last time I went and that was on a Tuesday in May before any school holidays etc....

Themepark,23r78d,neon,2,Wed Apr 23 18:15:03 2014 UTC,"I'll agree that the idea seemed amazing and extremely forward thinking with electric vehicles being the fore front.   I'm just not sure if Walt himself could have even made this a reality. The enormous cost alone would be incredible. Along with finding hundreds of companies to partner and cooperate with an overall leader in Disney, finding businesses to operate and have offices there, and people in general who would be willing to move their lives to this.   It's a great idea on paper, but extremely hard to actually follow through with."

Sending men to the moon, a booming economy and automobile industry, it seemed like America could achieve anything.  As much as I like to think it could have been pulled off, I believe it would have taken too long to make a reality (crucially, America would have been passed it's golden era), and enthusiasm from investors and the press would have dwindled before completion. It would have been a flop, unfortunately.  Even nowadays the plan seems revolutionary and futuristic. It is way before it's time, even now. The man was truly a visionary."

On some attractions such as Soarin' or Space Mountain with sparser waiting areas it's more forgivable, but I would never ever want to see a game screen in say, the lobby of Tower of Terror, and the interactive graveyard outside the Haunted Mansion bugs me quite a bit."
Themepark,23p1dt,Paimun,1 point,Wed Apr 23 05:56:13 2014 UTC,"I'm going to mostly disagree here.  When you have the queue for an hour and barely move, it's good to have some interactivity.  I do agree that you kinda have to choose one or the other... a queue like the Potter ride at IOA has enough to keep you looking around and the line is designed to move quickly.  But yeah, Space Mountian really needs those games."

Although we were visiting from Toronto and this was our only time going this year!  What a ride. The crowds were definitely insane.

Sometimes I feel bad that the guests with express passes can kind of just skip the line, but then I look at how much they paid for it and I almost feel bad for them. I'm sure Cedar Fair does something different than my company though; we're essentially based on attendance whereas I believe (correct me if I'm wrong) Cedar Fair is a flat rate"
Themepark,23n43d,RealNotFake,3,Tue Apr 22 14:25:08 2014 UTC,It was a moral decision. Do we spend our only day in the park this year in line for Banshee and maybe two other rides? Or do we pay the extra to get a full day out of King's Island?  If anything - I think FastPasses should work on a system where in a 12 hour operating day you get to skip the line once on each ride every six hour period. You shouldn't be able to re-ride and marathon on a single ride.  And yes - it was a flat rate all day. The pass was 55 without Banshee and 80 with it (and Firehawk). Crazy expensive.  *EDIT: Fixed FastPass pricing.

Themepark,23ct35,littlemonster010,7,Fri Apr 18 13:56:21 2014 UTC,"Given the choice, I'd go to Busch Gardens Williamsburg. It's more of a ""theme"" park with actual themed areas (all themed to different European countries as someone else mentioned) rather than an amusement park, with a ton of roller coasters built over blacktop. It really depends on what you want in an theme park/amusement park experience.  Theme  Busch Gardens Williamsburg is themed to several different European Countries - England, Scotland, Ireland, France, Germany, Italy), and you can definitely tell that effort was put into the theming. Busch Gardens is also consistently winning awards for the most beautiful theme park in the country.   King's Dominion has themed areas, but it's less themed than Busch Gardens for sure.  Roller Coasters  As far as ""real"" roller coasters (excluding smaller coasters geared more towards families)- Busch Gardens has 5. Kings Dominion has 11. It's not very fair to compare them coaster for coaster, because they're not the same product.   Kings Dominion has Intimidator 305, which is the tallest (305') and fastest (90mph) roller coaster between the two parks. They also have Dominator, a B&M Floorless Coaster, and Volcano: The Blast Coaster, which is a launched inverted Coaster. Kings Dominion also wins the Wooden Coaster battle with 3 (Hurler, Rebel Yell, Grizzly) to Busch Gardens' 0.   Busch Gardens has Apollo's Chariot, an incredibly smooth B&M Hyper Coaster, Alpengeist, a B&M Invert, Griffon, a B&M Floorless Dive Coaster, Verbolten, which features some great ride elements, and Loch Ness Monster, which was the first roller coaster with interlocking loops.  Food  Though I haven't been to either park in a few years, the food at Busch Gardens Williamsburg has always been better than the food at Kings Dominion. Trapper's Smokehouse at Busch Gardens has some of the best Theme Park food I've ever tasted with their wood smoked Brisket and chicken. Last time I was there, I had an Irish Steak sandwich from a stand in the ""Kilarney"" section of the park that was incredible. (Your friends from Ireland may not appreciate the inauthenticity.) They also have a great Italian-style restaurant that had great Chicken Parmesean.  If Burgers, Hot Dogs, etc. are more your speed, then Kings Dominion is perfect. One thing I will recommend is the Shrimp Sandwich at the ""Outer Hanks"" Seafood Restaurant. It was incredible.   Don't get me wrong. I love Kings Dominion, but for my money, I'd choose to go to Busch Gardens over Kings Dominion.   All of this said...it's very feasible to do both parks in a two day stretch. They're only about 90 minutes-ish apart. That's a trip I've done several times."

It's the same distance from DC as BGW (2.5-3hrs) and your friends might get a kick out of the whole Hershey scene. Some of the Hershey stuff might keep the baby interested too.  Don't even bother considering Six Flags America.
Themepark,23ct35,beekman57,2,Fri Apr 18 16:20:00 2014 UTC,"Busch Gardens for sure.  Kings Dominion has more rides but Busch Gardens is one of the most beautiful parks in the country.  It will be much more pleasant to be in while with the baby and not riding rides.  Plus Busch Gardens has a small wildlife area that would be fun to walk through.  I also wouldn't short change the roller coasters at Busch Gardens.  There are 5 total, and 3 of them are really top class."
Themepark,23ct35,coocookuhchoo,1 point,Fri Apr 18 19:54:10 2014 UTC,"Kings Dominion being my home park, Busch Gardens being my first park, and having been to both countless times...with a baby, I'd say Busch Gardens without a doubt."
Themepark,23ct35,InfectedWithRage,-1,Wed May 7 04:54:28 2014 UTC,Busch Gardens if good is your under 10 or over 65. It's a pretty park with overpriced food and people who smell like Ben Gay. Coasters are nothing to be desired. King's Dominion is also a very pretty park. And it has i305. The best Intamin giga and best coaster on the east coast. It's a thrill seeker park.  I vote King's Dominion all the way.
Themepark,23a98o,FunkyHenryGale,2,Thu Apr 17 17:26:25 2014 UTC,I haven't been to Kings Island in ages. How long has (In)Action Zone had such awesome lighting?
Themepark,23a98o,robotshoelaces,2,Fri Apr 18 00:55:12 2014 UTC,Lets see.... one day.
Themepark,23a98o,robotshoelaces,2,Fri Apr 18 02:14:28 2014 UTC,"Wow, that's some complex math. Thanks for working it out! ;)"

Themepark,23a98o,TheOnlyBoBo,1 point,Fri Apr 18 04:48:00 2014 UTC,Why is a ride called banshee painted red and blue?  It is the same color as the patriot and Worlds of Fun but that ride has a reason for the red and blue theme.
Themepark,237tg4,cyberjedi,3,Wed Apr 16 21:45:20 2014 UTC,"Wow, the loop is way bigger than I thought it would be from the pictures I've seen."
Themepark,237tg4,blladnar,1 point,Thu Apr 17 04:01:08 2014 UTC,i went on a water slide with a loop it was actually really fun
Themepark,237tg4,IAMA-CANADIAN-AMA,3,Thu Apr 17 20:58:10 2014 UTC,I can't imagine the pain of going down that on your stomach with your back bending back.  It was surely a different time.
Themepark,237tg4,scottwalker88,2,Thu Apr 17 08:43:38 2014 UTC,The short documentary
Themepark,237tg4,Terakian,2,Thu Apr 17 16:51:38 2014 UTC,The roaring rapids area looked cool. I wish more water parks had theming. I love water parks with slides built into the mountain.
Themepark,237tg4,HoliestDonut,1 point,Tue Apr 22 23:21:42 2014 UTC,"I agree so much, I would love to ride a slide with decent theming, maybe like you said a mountain or whatnot. Hell, imagine if there would even be animatronics along a slower part of the slide. That would be so cool"
Themepark,2361pu,scottwalker88,1 point,Wed Apr 16 08:47:42 2014 UTC,"They sure are promoting the hell out of this ride. It seems like one of those second thought, generic carnival types of rides to me. I mean yea, it's super high and you'll be facing the ground, but still not something I'll want to wait in the inevitable hour long line for."
Themepark,2361pu,ashella,2,Wed Apr 16 15:32:06 2014 UTC,"This ride terrifies me but I know what you mean about the queue. It's going to be huge wait for what is a 5 second experience. I'll be sure to try it though. If anything the long wait will be torture. IIRC a few days ago, it was rumoured that at Christmas, it would turn into a giant Christmas tree with lights extending from the top to the ground in a pyramid like fashion."
Themepark,2361pu,EricGarbo,1 point,Wed Apr 16 20:06:07 2014 UTC,"I think the facing the ground aspect is exactly what has been missing with drop rides, and it going to take it to the next level.  I really enjoy the height of Lex Luthor but how much higher can it really go and still add thrill?  This takes it in a different direction, literally and figuratively."
