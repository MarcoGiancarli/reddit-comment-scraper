The seating die is set up as normal, but the micrometer dial is used to fine tune the overall length of your cartridge to the nearest thousandth, to precisely set the jump or jam of the bullet for one particular bullet and one particular rifle combination.   If you don't own a bullet comparator, case length gauge, the die sets are of limited use to you. The sizing die follows the similar concept, except it bumps back the case neck very precisely for your fired cases  to allow for better feeding and concentricity.  If you don't own a cartridge gauge or mic, that die is of limited use for you as well."
reloading,3dzlqd,HumidNut,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:45:36 2015 UTC,Can you recommend a comparator and case length gauge?
reloading,3dzlqd,HumidNut,3,Mon Jul 20 23:56:44 2015 UTC,"I like the Hornady Bullet Comparator Kit the straight is for bolt guns, the curved is for guns where you can't load through the breech.  If you shoot 20-30 caliber, the basic set has all the inserts you need.  If you shoot big-bore, you'll need either the full kit, or piecemeal it together. Along with that kit, you need to have modified cases, one per caliber.   The modified case screws into the gauge, you put a bullet into the dummy cartridge, insert the gauge into your chamber, push the bullet forward until you feel it engage the lands of your chamber.  This will tell you the CBTO (Cartridge Base to Ogive -- pronounced ""Oh Jive"", not ""Oh Give"" measurement for a single bullet and single rifle.  This is the measurement that you use to either ""jump"" or ""jam"" your bullets in the cartridge.  Once you get that measurement that you like, you zero out your calipers, press a real round purposely longer than you intend (its easier to shorten the round, remember) and measure it against your calipers.  If you're off a few thousands, adjust the micrometer die accordingly until you get exactly where you want to be.  This method is very reliable and I regularly get 0.001"" deviation over 50 rounds, but the real advantage is how quickly you can dial the measurement in vs standard seating stems.   The amount of jump or a jam, heavily depends on your particular rifle and bullet, hence the load development.  You start at SAAMI length specs and move longer, never max length. The bump sizing dies, I'm not quite up-to-speed, but you need to know how far back your shoulder is, therefore you need a Headspace Kit.  You take a piece of brass fired in your gun, measure that distance, then set your bump sizer to that distance minus a ""few thousands"" to push the shoulder back and restore the round to a more concentric shape.  Again, there's means to do this without a micrometer die, but the advantage is speed and repeatability. Perhaps others can chime in on the real advantages of bump-sizing.    There's many products that are used to measure these data points, I use the Hornady ones because they're quite easy to use and relatively inexpensive compared to other offerings.  They're also pretty accurate according to my tools."

I do have some further questions if you don't mind answering.   Since I have the Redding Comp Three Die Set, I was wondering about the Neck Sizing die itself. What's the purpose of the micrometer adjustment if it's a bushing sizing and deprimer die? I have the latest Lee Reloading Manual but they don't mention anything about the micro adjustments. If I recall correctly, he's really not a fan of them. * Is there a better manual for Precision reloading? I found a combo of everything you suggested on Amazon plus a Comparator Set Body and Inserts. Are the inserts needed for this? Amazon Link"
reloading,3dzlqd,WStHappenings,4,Tue Jul 21 01:26:17 2015 UTC,"-- Except that Ogive is a real world with a dictionary pronunciation. The Bergers are really nice bullets, I really like them, but I'm shooting enough to where the $0.50+ / bullet significantly reduces my range time.  I scored a heck of a deal on the Sierra TMK's for 1/2 the price of the bergers.  If money were no object (custom bullets notwithstanding) I'd buy the bergers, though.  They are somewhat jump sensitive if what I've read holds true, so you probably will have to do both powder-charge and seating depth development.  Chase the chardge first, then chase the lands.     I'm not up to speed on bump sizing, its not something I have pursued.  I do FL sizing and what I've always heard called ""Neck Sizing"" where there's an expander ball to open up the case mouth and not touch the body.  The bump sizer I got (forster) just has inserts, and a rule of thumb about how much to bump (2 thousandths).  I'll give it a try, but its more an academic endeavor for me.   2.The comparator tool  should have a body (red anodized aluminum) and are used with the inserts.  The headspace gauge is a similar body with the elongated inserts (your link).  If you're shooting 30cal, the basic comparator set has the insert you need (it has 22, 24, 25, 27, 28, and 30 cal inserts).   You'll also need modified case for the caliber but amazon seems to be high.  Retail places that stock Hornady sells them for about $6/case."

The reasoning behind this is a heavy bullet generally takes less charge to create the needed pressure because it gives more burn time before it begins to move, creating more pressure with less powder.  A lighter bullet needs a greater charge because the bullet begins moving before the charge has ignited fully leaving greater space to pressurize, requiring more powder to create the extra heated gases needed to give the right pressure.  This is the best I can type on half a cup of coffee. :D"

reloading,3dwp5u,Alontis,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:10:35 2015 UTC,Hodgdon Load Center has data for 130gr BERB RN which to my understanding is a 130gr Berry's Plated. This will be the closest data youll find to yours other than getting it from Extreme.
reloading,3dwp5u,trentvb,2,Mon Jul 20 20:33:46 2015 UTC,"Correct me if i'm wrong, but, a heavier projectile will cause the pressure to spike higher before it moves. So, a smaller amount of powder will create more pressure than with a lighter projectile.  Think of it this way....if you take a fire cracker, light it, and place it on your open palm, you'll probably get some burn marks and a funny story to tell your friends.  Take that same fire cracker and hold it tightly in your hand, and, it will probably result in a trip to the emergency room.  A heavier bullet is like a tighter grip on the fire cracker...it builds more pressure with less powder.  There is also the fact that the heavier projectile is probably filling more of the case increasing the pressure that way as well."

Lake City brass has lower case volume than commercial 308 so you might need to bump the charge up a grain or two. Off course I can only run 2.812 because of magazine length. If you plan on manually feeding your rounds in then you need to find your OAL for your rifle because each one is different. Average tends to run around 2.85.

That being said, the more expensive brands like Nosler and Lapua have excellent consistency between each piece of brass.  I am currently using a lot of 500 Lake City military brass as I found them to have excellent consistency for internal capacity (54.4 gr H20, +/- 0.1 gr).  When these cartridges wear out after a few more reloads, I will likely invest in some Lapua brass."

reloading,3dstxu,HumidNut,1 point,Sun Jul 19 12:48:43 2015 UTC,Lake City is some pretty good military brass. Has pretty consistent case volume and the flash holes are drilled instead of punched. Only problem with military brass is that is has a smaller case volume so pressures tend to be higher and you have to lower the amount of powder you use. If you're going for max loads with some high volume powder then you might get into compressed range pretty quickly.

reloading,3dorj7,100jumpingbeans,2,Sat Jul 18 08:03:34 2015 UTC,Exactly. You want the the powder drop to articulate fully before feeling any significant pressure. If it cycles immediately it cannot extend any further and will crush the case. You want the powder drop to be in the top dead position just before the end of the down stroke.  I have to adjust the powder measure for every caliber.  Hornady sells Case Activated Lower Assemblies that can be set up for each case length.  Good luck!

I bought the Hornady manual because it has load data for .44AMP, but I also use it for comparing load data from other books.  The ABCs of reloading isn't terrible, and it has the added bonus of begin written by a guy who blew both his hands clean off, but it's dated.  The author mentions the rise in popularity of auto-loading rifles due to returning soldiers for instance.  I have it though, and check it for procedural stuff occasionally.  I don't have this manual but it does look pretty solid.  If you want to get into precision rifle shooting, I highly recommend anything by Brian Litz.  I'm a firm believer in having a shelf full of reloading books.  The thing to know is that almost everyone who published one has an agenda.  Bullet manufacturers publish data for their bullets with a lot of different powders.  Powder companies publish data for a lot of different bullet brands on top of their powder.  That's not necessarily bad, as they have tested their products extensively.  Reloading equipment manufacturers seems to be the most component agnostic, which is also good."

At least the way I reload on my turret, I always complete a round at a time and never stop in the middle, so there's no real chance of forgetting where I'm at and either missing a charge or double charging.  The rounds go from my clean brass bag -> turret -> completed round case.  I don't have one, but I'd buy the bullet puller that goes on the press and uses a collet rather than an impact buller.  Something about the impact ones just don't seem entirely safe to me.  You may want to consider getting the hand press and a decapping die as well.

Also just something to note - save a case of each size with a used primer and toss it in the box with your bullets.  When you're done reloading a given caliber, you can run that case through the powder-thru die a bunch of times to clear out any residual powder before you take it apart to put the powder back into the container for storage.

It's kept all but about a dozen pins in each batch inside the drum, but I catch those in a bowl for noe.  My next step is to try a filet coming from amazon that should fit inside the locking rings.

Unfortunately, work has forced a lull in my shooting and I haven't come up with a batch of brass big enough to mess with yet so other tinkering has taken precedence.   That said, I've done a little research and will share my thoughts. The diameter of the stainless pins is roughly 0.047"" which is a tad over 1100 microns.   There are some strainers that sit right on a 5 gal bucket (which are what I've used to handle post-tumble processing anyway) that can be had in the 600 micron range.  More in line with what you're trying, and probably cheaper than the bucket strainer, is using that fine mesh frying pan splatter screen, cut to fit, and inserted inside the slotted end cap of the drum, like you're doing with window screen. It's metal, so it should be pretty sturdy, but it can rust, so getting it completely dried out will be a must.  I definitely want to be able to rinse in the drum. As of now, my process has been: tumble > slotted end cap to dump into bucket > double handfuls of brass in rotary separator > brass into mesh bag > carefully drain off water in bucket with pins > rinse/repeat with pins > magnet pins onto tray to dry > rinse brass in mesh bag > dry brass in old food dehydrator.  With drying time, this process takes me about an hour to deal with a full drum. I could see having a screen saving 20 or 30 minutes off my processing time."

I just ran eight large batches or so through the FA tumbler this weekend, or doing brass laundry as my wife and I call it.  I spent about 15 minutes cycling between batches using this process:  1 - tumble  2 - dump through slotted end cap with screening inserted, into a bowl.  3 - pour out dark water, remove very few pins from bowl and return to tumbler drum.  4 - run clean water through tumbler, rotating to ensure thoroughness.  Again over bowl to catch pins.  5 - Dump entire drum into rotary separator, spin for five minutes or so.  6 - Scoop brass into dehydrator.    7 - Scoop pins back into drum, repeat from step one.  I don't know if it's dumb luck or what, but I didn't have any pins go from the separator to the dehydrator.  Being my first time using it, I inspected each batch pretty closely. I also hand feed my RL550, so I see each case before it goes under a die.  I'm pretty comfortable with the results so far."

I know in my testing I got the best groups with the Hornady bullets seated a few hundredths short of the manual's OAL.  Despite my saying that it's a safe charge, you should always work up a new load anyways - even if you just want to go for it with the new bullet (rather than doing a whole new development procedure), load one round each at the starting load and step it up a grain or two until you hit your chosen charge to verify safe pressures."

As of now, I am going from 124 to 147 ammo for IDPA, and I typically use barry's plated. I know the XTP is a fine, fine bullet, I really do.  I would rather sell what I have at the moment and just continue with plated for my IDPA. So far I have 500 115 gr. XTP and 200 155 gr. .40 cal (for my 10mm). I have three more vouchers to get Hornady ammo. I will probably just get .30 since I wouldn't use XTP for shooting paper.   Sorry if this reply is scattered, working on a project.

reloading,3d97o7,NiftyDolphin,5,Tue Jul 14 14:13:54 2015 UTC,"Alright let me clear up this rather confusing thread.   I load 147s for my CZ for competition on a daily basis. I have run the Bayou almost exclusively for the last 7k loads.   here is the deal.   The truncated cone bullets need to be loaded shorter than the 147 round noses. This is part of the conflicting data problem.   A 147 grain round nose will start touching the lands of my gun at 1.153 OAL.   A 147 grain Bayou coated truncated nose bullet will touch the lands at 1.130 OAL.   This means I have to change the OAL if I shoot extreme RN bullets vs the bayou TC bullets of the same weight.   Now, my CZ has a bit of a shorter chamber than other guns so these are not absolute numbers. My friend's XD can run the 147 RNs out to 1.169.  Best way to see where you need to be is a good ole fashioned plunk test. Load bullet, and drop into the barrel. Start long and drop it shorter and shorter until you hear the ""plunk"" and the bullets can be removed with a fingernail.   As for load data on the powder, I use a Maxim powder and have used Unique before. Both needed 3.4 grains to meet power factor reliably. I get roughly 890 fps from a 147 grain Bayou over 3.4 grains of Unique. If you wanted to load more stout loads, you might want to try green dot or some of the other faster burners."

I was using 147gr polymer coated truncated cone bullets, not unlike what OP is referring to. Maybe the round nose ones will be more forgiving.

Those .431s were likely designed for a .429 barrel.    It's always better to be oversized than undersized.

When you use a load developed for one rifle in another, you might not get the same accuracy (if rifle 1 works better with flat base bullets but rifle 2 works better with BT bullets, for instance); however, it should still meet or exceed the performance of commercial ammo. Unusual or specialty loads (unusual bullet shapes, especially high/low pressure or velocity, etc) may not cycle well in other types of firearms; for instance, a subsonic .300 Blackout load with a 110gr .30 carbine bullet would not likely work well in an AR-15 (or really anything feeding from a magazine), but wouldn't have any issues in my Handi Rifle (single shot break action)."
reloading,3d128f,richalex2010,2,Mon Jul 13 03:08:41 2015 UTC,"Are the bullets copper jacketed/plated or just lead projectiles?  Stock Glock barrels are (according to what I've heard) not supposed to fire exposed lead bullets due to hexagonal rifling in the barrel.    That being said, I've also ready numerous comments of people saying basically ""it's fine, I shoot lead bullets out of my Glock all of the time yadda, yadda...""  The issue being the hexagonal rifling can strip more lead off of the bullet than normal and fill the rifling changing the barrel diameter and causing additional pressure.    I would say if these are lead projectiles and the only ones you plan to fire in the gun, go ahead but watch closely for leading and clean it well.  Assuming this is a stock barrel and not a aftermarket one with standard rifling.  If they're plated or jacketed bullets you should be fine.    Then again, I'm a random stranger on the internet giving you advise about how to run a explosive device you hold in your hand.  I'm not a gunsmith and this is just my opinion, take it as you will, research official documentation/resources and use your own judgement."

Lastly, I think the idea of cornering the cast bullet market is somewhat of a fever dream; handing out free stuff isn't any way to capture this particular market, IMO.  Thanks for your comment, though. I disagree, but I do like to see alternative viewpoints shared because it helps me think better about my own.  EDIT: When I said, ""think better,"" what I mean to say is that alternative viewpoints help me to refine and expand my own thoughts, not that mine are necessarily better than someone else's."

reloading,3ctqxn,09cs,3,Fri Jul 10 22:03:05 2015 UTC,"You're talking about differences of thousandths of an inch. If what you're worried about is malfunction or catastrophic failure, be at ease. There's no way OAL ""error"" that small could cause negative effects unless the tallest possible round just happens to be long enough to jam into the rifling causing a failure to chamber, or the smallest possible causes ""stovepipes"" or other failures to feed. Assuming both the biggest and smallest ones will feed, you probably won't notice any performance difference at all.   Just remember that with pistol calibers as long as you don't double charge them and the rounds are within relatively normal size parameters, they're otherwise pretty easy on the tolerances (at least compared to rifle rounds). Not to mention unless you're trying to, for some reason, win accuracy competitions with the .45 ACP that most handloads don't need to be perfectly the same. The extra 0.003'' that round B is longer than round A isn't going to affect the bullet impact point compared to more prominent factors such as wind speed or your barrel, at the ranges I'm guessing you'll be shooting these."

Your COAL variance is mostly coming from the small variance where your seating die is contacting the bullet during the seating process. The seating die may contact the bullet at an ever so slightly different place because of the variances in the shape of the bullet itself. Hopefully that makes sense!"

I have found that some of the seating stems have a rough interior finish and grab the bullet if it is a little crooked so they will not seat the same each time. I also pulled out the seating stem and put it in a drill and polished the interior with a fine emery paper or steel wool to smooth it out and allow the bullet to slide on the interior surface and help center itself while seating."

reloading,3cmus3,arnoldrew,-1,Thu Jul 9 14:01:15 2015 UTC,"No, I don't think which press you use will determine if you produce more or less accurate or precise ammo.

reloading,3cmus3,pweekles,2,Thu Jul 9 16:22:55 2015 UTC,That's probably accurate for pistol ammo but is certainly not true for rifle.  While you can load very good rifle ammo on a progressive you'll have more runout than you would on a good single stage.  This is why you see so many of the precision rifle shooters using a Forster CoAx.
reloading,3cmus3,pyxis,1 point,Thu Jul 9 17:14:03 2015 UTC,"Since I've been reloading for a while and I don't even know what ""runout"" is, I guess I have some gaps in my knowledge. I always thought it was a function of the dies, not the press. A press is just a ram smooshing the case/catridge/bullet into the die, as far as I knew."
reloading,3cmus3,arnoldrew,1 point,Thu Jul 9 20:04:34 2015 UTC,"I'm new to reloading and know next to nothing. But the reading I did on the Forster Co-Ax tells me it does not have ""cam over"". Which I assume is at least a part of why it is able to be more precise."
reloading,3cmus3,pyxis,1 point,Fri Jul 10 01:20:10 2015 UTC,"I don't believe that to be the case.  Things like the Forster Co-Ax pride themselves on turning out ammo that has less runout than say an RCBS Rockchucker or a cheap Lee press.  If you are strictly speaking about plinking ammo, then a progressive will be suitable for both rifle and pistol, but for myself - I shoot precision rifle.  I won't touch a progressive for this process, as I want less moving parts and more control over the loading of the ammo.    Unfortunately I don't have any hard facts to back that up, beyond knowing that most precision shooters trust single stage vs progressive's to load their ammo.  I do however have an RCBS and a Forster and there is a marked difference in runout between the two when seating."
reloading,3cmus3,arnoldrew,0,Thu Jul 9 19:21:41 2015 UTC,The only reason I've ever heard for using the single stage for that purpose was that you can pay more attention to each individual round and monitor your processes a lot more thoroughly.
reloading,3cmus3,HumidNut,1 point,Thu Jul 9 20:02:06 2015 UTC,"Well your statement of a turret press will make the exact same ammo as a single stage is fairly inaccurate.  You introduce things like runout when you have more moving parts like a turret head.    The less moving parts you have, the more accuracy you can eke out of the press - because there is less margin of error and movement in those parts.  I want the press ram to go up the same way every time, I want the bullet seated the same way every time.   I don't feel that I would have a competitive edge vs someone who reloads with a single stage if I used a progressive.    Definitely paying more attention to what you are doing helps, but you can do that with a progressive...you don't need to just yank on the handle 1000 times to get your 1000 rounds.     For me, I just don't see any good reason to try to make a progressive press do what my single stage does very well.  If I reloaded for pistol, then I would definitely be using a progressive...but only because of volume, not for precision."

reloading,3cmus3,tfunkyfresh85,3,Fri Jul 10 01:04:12 2015 UTC,"It's where the bullet seating is not perfectly aligned with the axis of the case.  Basically, if the is any deviation, the bullet doesn't spin properly, it wobbles, sort of like throwing a football off-center."
reloading,3cmus3,webbdog,2,Fri Jul 10 02:41:55 2015 UTC,"Absolutely. Runout is when you seat a bullet, and it's not seated perfectly parallel with the neck. You can measure this with a case runout tool.   You place the loaded round into it, and the dial micrometer on the ogive of the bullet, and spin it.  Runout is visible on the dial Micrometer and should be under a couple thousandths of an inch for precision loads and f-class stuff.  For plinking and general shooting, runout is less of an issue.  Unless you are trying for super accurate rounds for precision shooting, runout isn't a big factor for you.  Here is a gauge in use:  http://m.youtube.com/watch?v=IwOT0s_c_sk"

You can get this at a local ACE Hardware etc. It'll come in a aerosol can and don't do it over carpet, it'll drip and you'll be scrubbing forever!  Is your thrower on a 100% stable bench? Variations in movement can cause small differences.  Your throw should be consistent as mentioned. Your upswing should make a minor ""clunk"" and you downswing should as well.  My Uniflow with most powders is <.1  Spherical powders like H110 and Longshot typically give me the best results too.  When setting up, I do 10 quick charges into my pan, dump back in and then do three measured throws. If all three are consistent I start loading and measure every 50 rounds (once I've finished a tray)  Make sure when you are where you want to tighten the lock ring on the micrometer.

It is the quality of his employee and their willingness to either properly manage them, fire the dead weight (At Will State) or properly pay them in the first place.  The read between the lines is that it seems that they have a high absentee rate. This is their problem and they need to solve it. The way to not solve is to eliminate overtime. Their problem is that they have a workforce they are paying x amount per week if all show up and if they do they then make x amount of Bullets which they can sell and meet all their fiscal goals. But what is happening is that 1,2 or x numbers of employees are not showing up so that then if they were to meet their goal they would then have to factor in Overtime which throws the numbers off.

When you make a specific product at a set cost it benefits the company and the employee under piecemeal. The company sees gained productivity. Employee makes as much money as they want (up to a maximum possible achievement.)  Under the hourly system you need to have honest, hardworking good employees. Else employee A makes 100 of ""X"" a day and employee B makes 50 ""X"".   One of two things happens:   1) Employee B gets replaced although he may be doing the best he can. 2) Employee A reduces his production to a similar level because he still gets the same pay and was disheartened by making the same while doing twice as much.  Overtime concern is because the owner can't currently run his shop in overtime because the cost differential doesn't get offset. If he is forced to pay time and a half bullets now cost 1.5x normal price to produce. Without piecemeal, a tired employee or employee who wants a few extra bucks without the added production may move a little slower during this time too, increasing the production cost greater still. He has two choices, make you wait a few extra days for your order or break even/lose money trying to get you satisfied quicker.  Wage modification is simple, it's a protection to prevent discrimination of individual employees. But its a double edged sword. Typically in a situation where this would happen the employee to be modified just gets their ""position eliminated"".  The best part is, he isn't talking about paying people less. Hes talking about company decisions hes had to make where someone needs eliminated to makes budget and other employees offered to take a cut instead of losing a co-worker and the paperwork/bureaucracy  involved prevented this.

These are cast bullets, coming out of a Magma machine or similar. Piecework, in this case, would mean the employees would have to wait on however quickly the machine made the bullets... so however quickly the machine can make them will dictate both the time and pay the employees receive. Since cast bullet making is usually a slowish affair, as the molds have to allow enough time for bullets to cool, for instance, then it seems that what the owner is really saying is that I shouldn't have to pay you for my slow machines, instead, you should only be paid on how many bullets you can package from a machine. How is that fair? If you supply me a 486 computer with WordPerfect on it, I can still write an article.

If the pay rules are different they'd be different for everyone. This results in a net of 0 competitive advantage. Your bottom line will remain unchanged as if there are savings realized all competitors will lower price of product. Workers suffer. Marginally cheaper product price results. It's wasted effort.  You want to incentivetize the wrong behavior. The outcome you seek is better business performance. This is generally achieved via 'bonuses'. You rant about wanting to do it instead on perceived worker productivity in a micro-view within your business (piecemeal work). One results in workers wanting the business to do better. The other results in them attempting to meet arbitrary goals. Which goal are you trying to achieve again? You are speaking at cross purposes if you believe in market forces."
reloading,3cko4u,thermobollocks,1 point,Fri Jul 10 23:14:58 2015 UTC,"Text: In the course of building this business, Jo Ann and myself have always actively searched for better and more efficient ways of doing things. That's what everyone in business has to do, of course. Along the way, we came to realize that we weren't really competing with other bullet casting companies so much as we were competing with ourselves, always looking to do things better today than yesterday. There were countless little things we learned in the areas of equipment, procedures, spare parts policies, employee count, and so forth. And by this point, I believe that we have things tuned up the best we ever had.  But there are things that we can't tune up and it has to do with government. And so, I thought I would share my thoughts on how the government chokes business and seriously harms business and the employees who operate the business. These snags pertain mainly to labor policies.  1.) Restriction on piecework pay We can't pay employees based upon piecework. I wish we could. I would be happy as could be if we could pay a base hourly rate and a premium on top of that based upon a per-piece completed effort. The incentives are thereby clearly exposed and folks will work harder knowing that every effort will be rewarded. Employees would be motivated to compete with themselves and the reward for improved performance would be clear - money! The way it is, the pay is flat and there is no real positive incentive driving individual production. A generally similar, but inferior, practice relates to bonuses, but bonuses are hard to target and resentment can result from a bonus paid to someone else. Why not just cut the employees loose to produce as much as they can and reward them for each piece produced? Who is being protected by prohibiting piecework, exactly? The employees could generate more income, the company would benefit from a reduced unit labor cost which would result in price reductions, more money for equipment and infrastructure, there is more profit upon which taxes would be paid, and it's win-win-win. So, why the prohibition on piecework pay? Who benefits, exactly?  2.) Overtime prohibition Why is overtime pay required for work in excess of 40 hours per week? The need for occasional overtime pay doesn't relate to abusing employees when absenteeism has cut production or product demand ramps up. It is fair to neither the employee nor the employer that overtime pay must be paid for overtime hours. Unit labor costs are fixed and product cannot be sold at loss for very long. What is wrong, exactly, with providing an option to the employee that he may earn extra money by staying over beyond close-of-business or a weekend if the work is there and needs to be done because things are running behind? Who benefits from this policy?  3.) Wage modification prohibition Although it is possible to reduce someone's pay, it requires paperwork, a long notice period, and interaction with the state. The problem is that a company might be experiencing problems that require people be terminated due to the lack of ability to pay them. But what if some employees agreed to take a pay cut instead of having to see their co-workers fired? Isn't that fair? An employer doesn't need permission from the state to raise someone's pay but it needs their permission - and a lot of paperwork - to reduce someone's pay. What business is it of theirs, exactly? Why not let the employee and employer decide - for themselves - what is in their best interest?  Thus conclude my opening rant.  Good shooting, everyone!"
reloading,3cko4u,TotesMessenger,9,Wed Jul 8 17:35:59 2015 UTC,"2.) Overtime prohibition Why is overtime pay required for work in excess of 40 hours per week?   Most labor laws/policies stem from the very basic idea of quid pro quo. You get something from me, I get something in return. Not everything is so simple, as there is an incredible disparity in bargaining power in employer/employee context (employer pretty much has all the power), the law/policy are usually enacted for the protection of both parties. Overtime pay specifically protects the employee from being forced to work more than a required amount without pay. From employer's point of view, everything that can be done to save costs (including labor costs) will be done eventually. Requiring overtime pay is a layer of protection against employer abuses that will happen eventually.   3.) Wage modification prohibition Although it is possible to reduce someone's pay   This also has to do with the incredible disparity of bargaining power between an employer and the employee. If the employer could persuade the employee to take a pay cut on a whim, it wouldn't be fair to the employee in the context of at-will employment contracts. Same thing, quid-pro-quo. You get something from me, I get something in return. The law and policy is simply trying to make sure that both employer and employee stand on equal footing in terms of employment context."

reloading,3cfeq1,badlife,2,Tue Jul 7 20:34:20 2015 UTC,"I posted this about 8 months ago, so I'll just repost it:   The Chargemaster is going to be accurate enough for many cartridges and applications without having to trickle at all. I trickle when I'm feeling anal or when I'm doing ladder/OCW tests The Chargemaster is often, but definitely not always, bang on the money in terms of dispensed powder. For me it's about 10% of the time that it's perfect to within .02 gr, which is the resolution on my scientific scale, and I don't trickle at all. That's about a single kernel of most stick powders. Another 20% of the time it's close enough that it's well within my fudge factor for my particular application, including ladder/OCW tests. Maybe I would want to add or remove a kernel or two. About another 60% of the time it's very close and just needs a tiny bit more or less to come in perfectly. And about 10% of the time it's obviously way off (never more than .2 gr) and I either throw the charge back in or fix it with some liberal trickling. In many of those cases, the Chargemaster will actually know it's gone over and warn you. The speed of it dispensing just about matches the speed at which I'm seating bullets, so dispensing with a Uniflow or similar wouldn't actually speed me up. The Chargemaster also has a feature where it'll auto-dispense once you put the pan back on the platen and it's stable, so you don't have to fiddle with buttons. I could probably save some time by charging cases in bulk with a regular powder thrower, but I like to arrange my workflow so that I charge a case and then immediately seat a bullet without putting the case down-- that completely eliminates the possibility of a double charge or a squib load. For loading multiple charge weights in a session, the Chargemaster is awesome. No fiddling with knobs and waiting for a stable throw-- you just dial in your new weight and go. This is great for load development.   BTW, we're talking precision rifle for sure here. I don't think I'd be nearly so worried about a stray .1 gr when loading for pistol rounds.  In fact I've thought about finding a way to speed things up with a regular powder thrower, once I've found a really good load with a wide tolerance.  Since I originally wrote that, I've had more experience with it. The type of powder definitely makes a difference. Ball powders like Win 748 meter very well. Powders like 8208 XBR are darned good. Big stick powders like IMR 3031 or Varget are the least accurate because what can happen is a few individual kernels can drop off the end of the dispenser tube while the Chargemaster is tricking up and, since they are big sticks, it'll push you over the desired charge weight.  Also, the +/- .1 gr variation is going to make less difference for your large cartridges like 308 than it will for your 223. I don't use it for pistol loads.  Overall, I'm super happy with it. Bear in mind that I'm in Canada, so I paid much more for it than you guys will, and I still think it's worth it."

reloading,3cfeq1,badlife,5,Tue Jul 7 16:57:14 2015 UTC,"Sure. But while you're doing the dipping and trickling, I'm already seating a bullet while the Chargemaster is dispensing the charge for the next round.

reloading,3c9str,spearchunker,2,Mon Jul 6 20:09:44 2015 UTC,Based on the question it sounds like you are a new reloader. Get a manual or 3 if you don't have one already. Lots of information in them including stuff like this.   Both full and neck size dies will deprime. If you are reloading 223 for semi auto or from brass that wasn't shot from your gun then skip neck sizing die and go with full.

Do you mean vs the ""wtf"" trimmer. They do sell inserts for different calibers. I'll only be reloading one or two for a while (not doing it for the savings, just better ammo). Is the lyman you're talking about the same type as the RCBS on my list?   The rcbs precision mic also accomplishes the same task as the hornady comparator. Stick a fire formed case in to get a baseline of the datum, then resized case to adjust to minimum headspace."
reloading,3c8yvo,Right_Brained,1 point,Mon Jul 6 11:20:52 2015 UTC,"Yes, and I believe it is the WFT trimmer (worlds finest trimmer).

reloading,3c8yvo,Right_Brained,2,Mon Jul 6 19:23:55 2015 UTC,I'd recommend looking at the Giraud Tri-Way trimmer.  It's very similar to the WFT but has a 3-way cutter so you don't have to deburr and chamfer after trimming.  I dumped my WFT for one and will never go back.
reloading,3c8yvo,barnitosupreme69,1 point,Mon Jul 6 14:37:42 2015 UTC,"That looks very interesting. Seems like it introduces another possible point of headache though. If the necks are not concentric to the shoulder, the chamfer and debur might be uneven. Have you experienced any issues with this?  Also, this is in addition to both tools indexing off the shoulder. My understanding is that you want consistent over all case length for proper bullet seating, and that shoulder to neck length isn't really important. Do you find you got much variance with overall length with either tool? This made me nervous with the ""wtf"" tool as well."
reloading,3c8yvo,SpreadyMercury,1 point,Mon Jul 6 15:30:15 2015 UTC,"In theory if your neck wasn't concentric with the shoulder you could have variances.  However, if you have enough of a misalignment to cause visible issues with the chamfer/deburr it would be hard for me to believe that your ammo isn't going to lack accuracy regardless of your trimming method.  Secondly, if you're chamfering/deburring by holding the case with your hand you're going to have FAR more variation just due to the unsteadiness of how you hold the case each time.   In regards to the shoulder indexing, if you're running a sliding sleeve seating die (so all micrometer seaters that I know of) you're indexing that off the shoulder as well so I don't think it's an issue to worry about.    Giraud also makes a bench mounted trimmer that uses the same cutting head as the tri-way and also indexes off the shoulder.  It has a more powerful motor and spins much faster (and costs much more).  This is used by some of the best shooters in the world.  In fact, Erik Cortina did a great YouTube video about it here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZpACwFmllE"
reloading,3c8yvo,max4hd1,1 point,Mon Jul 6 18:48:36 2015 UTC,"That's not how a sleeved seating die works. A sleeved die is still indexed off the base of the cartridge, giving consistent CBTO. It's the force between the ram on the cartridge base, and the bullet punch adjusted by the mic that does the seating. The sleeve is just free floating to support and center the cartridge. That's why they tell you to make the base of the die (not the sleeve) touch the the shell holder than back it off a touch.   The difference is the sleeve fully surrounds the cartridge BEFORE the bullet starts to be seated. Yes the shoulder is contacting the sleeve first, and what is pushing the sleeve up (against the spring), but the location of the sleeve and shoulder is irrelevant to the actual depth of bullet seating. I know this to be true for redding dies anyway, as that is the one I examined, but I imagine the rest work the same way, because working any other way would result in inconsistent CBTO and inconsistent bullet land engagement, which is the point of half of these fancy tools.   Edit, also to clarify a little better for understanding, the sleeve moves freely over the bullet punch, and the mic raises and lowers the bullet punch.. What determines the bullet seating depth is the distance/position of the ram/base of cartridge, and the bullet punch/mic. For it to be shoulder indexed the bullet punch would need an adjustable stop for the sleeve adjusted separate from the punch."

reloading,3c5mfu,corduroyshirt,1 point,Sun Jul 5 13:20:35 2015 UTC,Lots of my priming problems were inadequate swaging of mil crimped primers. 45's and '06 run sweet but throw a 556 case that's not swaged enough in the mix and everything comes to a halt.

reloading,3c5mfu,TubesBestNoob,1 point,Sun Jul 5 14:24:53 2015 UTC,He was telling me I needed an RCBS Rockchucker.  I do believe it to he a better product but at 2-3x the price it didn't make sense for me at the time.
