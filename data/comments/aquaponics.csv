aquaponics,3e5io0,deweydb,4,Wed Jul 22 02:56:03 2015 UTC,"Keep in mind that surface area-related nitrification rates and actual volumetric nitrification rates might not coincide. Meaning a 1200 m2/m3 carrier might not necessarily have  exactly twice the performance of a 600m2/m3 carrier. This is because the nitrification performance is not only dependent of surface area. The hydrodynamic performance of the media, the amount of air you put through, placement of sieves and tank hydraulics all play a role in the filter's performance.   The best bet is to go to the literature and see some real life data on the volumetric removal rates of the carriers. If this volumetric removal rate is divided by SSA, then you get SSA-specific removal rate that you can cross-check with other publications. Keep in mind that some authors provide a volumetric removal rate BY UNIT VOLUME OF MEDIA and others provide a volumetric removal rate BY UNIT VOLUME OF BIOFILTER. This biofilter will be filled up to 50-70% so you need to factor that.   Looking at the table you provided from the chinese supplier: how in hell you can have some many variable types of media and they all have eyactly the same performance? Nah son...   The good things about media such as Kaldness is that they have been tested over and over so you can have a good idea of their performance. ""Clone"" media such as allied aqua should perform similarly.   In the end, for a backyards system, probably media performance is not a big thing to worry about so you can go with a cheap media, include good safety margins on your calculations and design your MBBR for 50% filling with future capacity to expand to 70% if you ever need it."

aquaponics,3e5io0,PotentPonics,-2,Wed Jul 22 13:24:34 2015 UTC,Waste of time and money in aquaponics. Between the surface area of your media and the surface area of your roots adding this kind of filter will do little to nothing to effect your chemistry. Only if your running a barebones raft system with this help at all. Don't waste your time.
aquaponics,3e5io0,Pastelitomaracucho,2,Wed Jul 22 04:17:52 2015 UTC,Bollocks. Comes down to numbers if you need extra nitrification or not.
aquaponics,3e5io0,PotentPonics,0,Wed Jul 22 07:25:18 2015 UTC,Nope. If you have a media bed they are completely useless. Adding less than  1% additional surface area won't do anything but waste money.

aquaponics,3e2gb7,DavidSlain,2,Tue Jul 21 23:01:05 2015 UTC,"My first observation is that Copper (at all) in an aquaponics system is a no-no.  It tends to leach not-nice things into your system over time.  I'm not sure if it's your fish or your plants that are in danger, though.  You'll find that anything not food grade is generally frowned upon (the silicone), if not outright discouraged, because the whole point is to make something you can eat, and that doesn't have all the extra toxins that 'regular' food that you buy at the store has.    All in all, this is an awesome build.  Looks good, just a couple inherent flaws that I noticed."
aquaponics,3e2gb7,aquaponics_in_paradi,2,Tue Jul 21 16:11:19 2015 UTC,Thanks for the feedback and the kind words! Literally just last night I inspected the makeshift supports I used to hold up the bed and found that the copper had leeched already. I knew that copper would contaminate pretty quickly but I was surprised it was THAT fast. Since those hang directly over the water I replaced them with some spare pieces of acrylic that seem to be working quite well. I'll keep an eye on the brackets holding up the irrigation tube. They don't see too much water.   Any suggestions on silicone alternatives or should I just go with a food grade one?
aquaponics,3e2gb7,patsky,3,Tue Jul 21 16:29:47 2015 UTC,"I'd stick with food grade everything, just to be safe.  Remember, even if you're not eating the plants, your fish are coming into contact with whatever you've got in your system.  It could poison your fish more easily than you."

Then, being the lazy gardeners we are, we let them self seed.  We're just now seeing seeds germinate from basil that was planted two years ago.

aquaponics,3dxys7,hackshack40,3,Mon Jul 20 13:24:10 2015 UTC,I've changed the way I use the Dutch buckets. Before I used a net put bucket lid and let the roots hand down. Now I fill up the buckets with media and the difference is definitely noticeable.  Probably for several reason. The biggest being less heat in the root zone.
aquaponics,3dxys7,Whittigo,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:25:57 2015 UTC,I've got some dutch buckets set up like this filled with hydroton. For the drain I put it a few inches up from the bottom and just put a cap with a few holes drilled on the pipe. How do you have yours set up? I have hops in my buckets and one of the buckets got clogged from root growth so I think I need to rework that idea in the future.
aquaponics,3dxys7,Whittigo,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:46:02 2015 UTC,"I had mine very similar. The only difference is I don't have a cap on mine. I just have it barely of the bottom.Probably about the thickness of 3 sheets of paper. That has been working well especially on small rooted plants.  However right after making this video I had a tomato plants root stop up one of my buckets.  I did make a change on that buckle, one that I think will work much better I will make a video explaining that within the next coming days."
aquaponics,3dxys7,Whittigo,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:56:17 2015 UTC,"I put my outlet a few inches up to have a constant reservoir of water should the system shut down for whatever reason, the plants can live off that for a little while. I've thought about building a PVC ring or something in the bottom with lots of tiny holes then going into the outlet, much harder for roots to clog all of that. But I'm sure they would find a way eventually. And that would require taking the plants out to put something like that in the bottom of the bucket.  My current idea is to rework the dutch bucket system and have them all sit on some type of bed, wicking or growbed I dont know, and just have holes in the bottom of the buckets so they drain into the bed and then that bed has a drain back into the system. Still have the water come in the top of the buckets, but roots can go crazy and if it overflows a bucket it will still wind up in the bed."
aquaponics,3dxys7,dbarchitect,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:19:49 2015 UTC,That's how mine is as well. A few inches of the bottom of the bucket with the pipe in the inside going all almost all the way down to the bottom of the bucket. I did have it clog this way. I had a big tomato plant that I had to take out to fix out. I lost about 80% of the root to that plant.  That's the beauty of aquaponics I put it back in the bucket after having it lay on the ground with barely any roots while I fixed the bucket design. It wilted for a couple of days and now it's back to kicking booty.

aquaponics,3dze6z,poweredbypleiades,2,Mon Jul 20 19:41:17 2015 UTC,"Your problem isn't a matter of adjusting flow rates. You have your system designed incorrectly.  If you have bell siphons, then you need a sump. Your sump is supposed to be the lowest point in the system and the pump goes in the sump. That way the water level fluctuations occur in the sump tank. It needs to be the volume of your aquarium and at least as tall. A large sump will protect from possible overflows. You also don't need two bell siphons for a single growbed. It's redundant, they won't trigger at the same time and they will disrupt each other. You can control the water level of your aquarium by installing an overflow drain hole, or a riskier overflow pipe/overflow box. Have these drain into the sump. Sump pumps up to the growbed. Growbed back to the aquarium. I find this works best for an indoor system where the plants are usually on the highest level.  Edit: Here is a design of my little indoor system. Notice the sump at the bottom, with a pump. One drain. Overflow pipe on the aquarium to maintain a constant water level: http://imgur.com/a/3tTU6"
aquaponics,3dze6z,Optimoprimo,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:16:59 2015 UTC,You turned your aquarium into a sump. Water levels in sumps go up and down.   You either need to use a sump or just remove the bell siphons.
aquaponics,3dydbz,krystar78,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:21:13 2015 UTC,"Hah, I JUST commented on the video /u/hackshack40 posted about my issues with that. I have buckets set up about the same as what he has in that video and one of my drains already got clogged and I had to stick a metal rod and push the roots back into the bucket and on another one I've reduced the flow like you are talking about so it wont overflow the bucket.  I don't see it ceasing to be an issue with this kind of setup. I'm thinking when I move and change things up instead of having an outlet pipe on the side I'll just drill a bunch of small holes on the bottom and have all the buckets sitting in a giant grow bed. Water still going into the top of the buckets, but then down into this wicking or grow bed and the drain back to the sump will be at the end of the bed. The roots will have to be very strong to grow all the way down out of the bucket, and they should tend to want to stay where the water comes in more than go down like that. And even if it does clog it a bit and overflow the bucket it just overflows into the bed.  That's my first idea anyway. I'll think on it more when the time comes to make any changes."
aquaponics,3dydbz,Whittigo,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:54:02 2015 UTC,"Yea I'm thinking that going down to a drip will decrease the amount of saturation volume, but maybe that'll result in starving some of the roots.

But I can't imagine in 3 months what I'll have to deal with"
aquaponics,3dwvc4,deweydb,4,Mon Jul 20 05:05:26 2015 UTC,"I would be apprehensive but stuff happens in the sourcing for materials game.  For food grade barrels I usually do a light acid/alkaline alternating wash ( diluted HCL/muriatic and then epsom/baking soda).  With your situation, still do that but before & after, perhaps get your hands on a couple kilograms/pounds of activated charcoal and then do something like this - http://imgur.com/4FnjOat  You have the barrel, fill it with water, put a 1"" to 1.25"" pipe down the middle.  Get a small 2qt/64oz bucket, grab some cheesecloth or fine mesh ( whatever holds the charcoal in ).  Drill holes all along the bucket ( take the pipes inner diameter, double that as X, take whatever drill bit you have divide its size by X... make that many holes ).   Put that apparatus in the barrel, put the charcoal in, fill the drum until the water flow out of the top of the pipe and into your bucket filled with AC.  You will have to move the AC around from time to time as it tends to compact, if some of it spills into the barrel, that's not a problem as its all going to be dumped out later.  That may or may not leach out and collect most of the crap in the barrels lining If it doesn't, you can always use them as part of an outdoor rain catcher setup to water non-edible plants.  Also as for pipe/bucket setup, you can re-use that later for rinsing large amounts of media without wasting a lot of water.  Best part, with that setup it's fairly trivial to adjust the media's pH instead of trying to fix it when you put it into an AP setup.  edit:  cut out curse/swear words."
aquaponics,3dwvc4,zynix,1 point,Mon Jul 20 07:08:22 2015 UTC,"Dude! This is amazing advice. Thank you for the help! I would never have thought of the acid/base washes, or the activated charcoal.  I did think that since soap is a surfactant that I could probably dump some used cooking oil in the barrels and wash it around, hoping it would ""use up"" some of the soap.  But I like your plan a lot more :)  Cheers.  Also, I'm dying to know how this post sounded pre edit. Lol."
aquaponics,3dwvc4,zynix,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:00:17 2015 UTC,"Surfactant are some of the worst stuff in hydro to get rid off, hell probably with everything.  Acid/base washes kind of act like chemical sandpaper, hopefully bonding or reacting with whatever is in the plastic.  Going back and forth is like changing from one type of grit to another.  It may or may not work for your case.  The apparatus is an air lift pump.  Given enough air pressure/flow, it can lift water 1/2 as high above the water as the pipe is below.  So ideally you won't need to fill the barrel completely with water.    In the late 90's I worked as a factory systems programmer for a company specialized in retrofitting 50 gallon steel drums.  They had a machine like the design I gave, only attached to a high pressure air line pumping ozone & AC slurry and was completely sealed; did the exact same job in ~15 seconds."

aquaponics,3dwvc4,zynix,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:57:38 2015 UTC,"Before you do anything.  If you have the lid to the barrel.  Get a wet cloth, wipe the inside so its got few drops of water, put a couple small clumps of baking soda on it and polish using a sponge/scrubby pad.  Rinse off with vinegar.  Sniff test.  If it smells slightly less soapy/floral, this might work for you.  Otherwise, ~5 gallons with a couple tablespoons of baking soda/calcium carbonate.  Seal barrel up, slosh it around, roll it on its side, just go to town.   Pour that out into a bucket and see if it bubbles ( keep a note of that ).  Rinse the barrel out with a quick hose spray.  Acid + AC can go at same time.  Activated charcoal is kind of useless in a basic/alkaline solution so go for hot tub HCL levels.  Just be sure not to get to crazy and grab protective gloves ( I think yellow sink gloves will work, please verify for your own safety ).   Run the air/water lift with AC, maybe stick another air stone in the bottom to try and keep the mesh from compacting.  Make sure to have the mesh lining in place to keep the AC from leaking out ( it doesn't matter if it does, the air lift should draw it back up into the bucket.  Drain, keeping a 4-5 gallon sample and testing for bubbles/smell or surface oils.  Rinse with hose.    AC should go in the middle but you can do multiple acid/base washes before/after.  You do not need that much water, just enough to react with the liner surface.  If this doesn't work, call it a day and see if you can find some blue barrels ( in the USA, those ""should"" always be GRAS containers )."
aquaponics,3dwvc4,zynix,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:32:21 2015 UTC,"Again, thank you for your very detailed and useful instructions.  I think i have figured out how to build the contraption and i've got a test run going on now, but it is too late at night (dark) to take pictures and show you.  I will take some photos tomorrow.  Actually i was thinking about making a separate post about it, because the idea might be helpful to others.  But before i do that i need to make sure i've actually got it working ok.  As for the test suggestion.  I did what you suggested with the lid, and indeed it did bubble, and the soap smell has gone down.  Even after just doing one pass of baking soda and water in the barrel, the soap smell was massively reduced.  And the surfactant/alkaline water was bubbling like crazy afterwards.  By the way, i did not mention this before.  But I do have the blue barrels, they are 50 Gal, with the black snap lids.  I'll post some pics tomorrow.  I have a few more questions.   What amount of muratic acid should i add per gallon, or barrel? i don't really get what you mean by ""hot tub HCL levels"" How long does the activated charcoal last? can i reuse it for other barrels/washes? or is it a one time thing? (it's quite expensive that stuff, or maybe i just don't have a good source, i bought it at a pet store, and usually pet stores are pricey for everything). My setup currently has the small bucket hanging from a stick across the lid of the barrel, but because the water level doesn't go all the way to the top of the barrel, how do i clean out the top 1/3rd of the barrel liner?   Thanks again for your super awesome help!"
aquaponics,3dwvc4,zynix,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:15:39 2015 UTC,"To make sure the loop is running, you should have a pretty consistent up welling of water coming out of the top of the pipe... not like a water fountain force but just a consistent flow of water.  That will turn the water in your drum over from top to bottom, multiple times using just an air pump.   Goal is to adjust your pH to below 6.0 ( using an API fresh water test kit ), get the pH test color yellow and then let it cycle with water looping up the pipe and back down. You can re-use it for several washes, just make sure to dry it out and if possible get some desiccant or grains of rice to keep it dry.  Sealed up in an air tight container.  You can prolong its life by baking exhausted activated carbon in 200c ( ~400F ) for two hours and or grind to a smaller granule.   To be conservative, use smaller amounts for the first barrel and see how it goes.  There's likely going to be a rainbow colored sheen to the water that you will need to siphon off.   The major contributor to AC expiration is being gummed over with bacteria, the low pH should help minimize that. Raise the water so that it's about 1-2"" short of the lid.  Keep in mind that about half of that water can be re-used for the other barrel ( yes it will slow down the whole rinse cycle ) along with most of the AC from the first barrel.   Before you turn air on, get a sharper to mark the water line so that you know later when you will need to scrub by hand.   Also, start looking for things you can reuse the water with.  50-100 gallons of water would be a waste to just throw away, but you could try using it to clean your car or try watering plants you're not completely attached to ( just in case )."

aquaponics,3dwvc4,amorrowlyday,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:03:11 2015 UTC,"One more additional thought.  I am working with some professional growers on an experiment to switch a small part of a hydroponic system over to AP.  Hydro is great but they use stuff AP doesn't and they've been going through a similar process.  Your first setup with these barrels, grab the ultra-cheap .05 gold comets ( feeder fish ) and don't get attached to them.  If this going to be out doors, grow flowers or lavender for the first go around.    Reality is that your first attempt growing plants and raising fish is going to be less then perfect.  I have a small graveyard of fish theoretically ranging in value from comets ( over stocked ) to ~100 minnows + their fry (heater failure), 14 cat fish ( pump failure ).     The flowers will help absorb whatever is left over, a more extreme case are sun flowers which is apparently the plant version of a cat fish - https://disarmnowplowshares.wordpress.com/2010/06/22/sunflowers/  ( cat fish eat anything, one of my first cat fish losses was due to it eating an air stone... cause why not, right? )"

I don't know 100% if the Tilapia will eat it, but I know it is healthy for humans and other animals to eat.  It will clean the water and provide shade.  Floating plants with longer roots will provide hiding places for the fry.    Depending on what grows in that climate, you could introduce emergent food crops to the shallow part of the pond to clean the water and provide hiding places for fry.  Rice is one option, but I'm not sure it grows well there.  Not sure this would work, but you could make some sort of fine mesh movable divider in the pond and introduce different age fish on each side.  As you harvest from one side and the other gets older you move the mesh.  The benefit of having a divider instead of separate barrels is the system is larger and more stable.  You could also attach a weighted floating net to one corner of the pond and stick fry in there.  Things that make fry grow faster are good food, clean water, high oxygen, and optimal temperature.  You can get higher oxygen with either larger surface area in the barrels, or an air pump.  The disadvantage of the air pump is you need electricity and if it goes out, all the fry might die if they are too densely packed.  Be sure to get one with a battery backup or have a backup plan if the power goes out."
aquaponics,3dq1pm,goltoof,2,Sat Jul 18 09:38:43 2015 UTC,It entirely depends on what crop you want to grow.   For greens they will grow fastest and best in rafts or verticals about equally.  For flower and fruiting plants fruit trees or thing flowering really a media beds or preferably dual root zone pots in a media bed is best for maximum production of those crops.  For root crops like potatoes onions carrots wicking beds will give the best yield.   For herbs with essential oils horizontal NFT is best because you can pull them out regularly and trim the roots to slightly stress the plant and induce that oil or antipest production that gives you the flavors and scents you desire.  So it really just depends on what your growing.
aquaponics,3dq1pm,PotentPonics,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:25:43 2015 UTC,"Well thats pretty much the question, sky's the limit on what i can grow but it's not so obvious which setup works best for each crop.  Also some plants do better at a certain ph so one would think sticking to plants that are happy around the same ph is best practice."
aquaponics,3dq1pm,PotentPonics,2,Sat Jul 18 18:42:05 2015 UTC,the only plant that requires a different setup for pH is berries everything else can easily be solve in other ways. For example I have found you can keep a plant that likes a low or high pH perfectly happy in a dual root zone pot in a normal system as long as the soil pH is at or close to what the plant normal wants. The level of control dual root zone planting provides is unparalleled in aquaponics and you will see it used more in the future for that reason. It brings that level of control to aquaponics that you don't normally have.   Now you have your list on how to grow what. You need to figure out what you want to eat or grow or if for production what your local area will support at a profit you can live with. Go talk to local chefs bnbs and dinner party clubs and groups and find out what they will by at what price and figure out whats going to work best for you. What might make you a ton of money might not make much money 2 states over.
aquaponics,3dq1pm,Jasper1984,1 point,Sat Jul 18 19:27:25 2015 UTC,"I am just a layman, but was wondering that.. if flowing everywhere forces pH the same, and perhaps thins chelates, and other things roots produce to control their environment.  Did people already experiment much with i.e. length of flood in eb-and-flow. (the length of the flood, as besides the period of the whole cycle) For instance, if you expect that plants make use of the soaked eb time to get the pH in the right range etcetera, then you might think that a short flood is better than a long one.(i dont know) I suppose such experiments are tricky because the plants grow kindah slow, and there are a lot of complicating factors..  Also wonder what happens with the minerals in fish poop of dual-root, where the water is too basic for the plants to get at them. Could watering the plants from the top with this water be sufficient to prevent these from accumulating, and utilize the minerals, for instance, or is wicking enough to extract them?  Sorry if i am being stupid.."
aquaponics,3dq1pm,PotentPonics,3,Mon Jul 20 16:04:58 2015 UTC,No in a dual root zone you want no wicking. You can top feed and top water in any additional nutrients you need with out effecting the fish. You can also run the soil at a different pH. The fish water is not to basic its just different than hydro thats all. The bacteria present make those nutrients present its just that phosphate and potassium if you get them to hydro levels is not good for the health of the fish long term.   Hope that answers your question

Everyone complains that they bring pH up to 8+ and have certain chemicals that have not been proven to be food safe.  The pH problem sounds like the biggest concern as I've heard dumping a bunch of acid into the system barely puts a dent on the buffer.   Do you not have this issue?

Here's the odd thing; in DI water, I didn't notice any measurable pH shift after soaking growstones for 12 hours. In tapwater, dechlorinated water, and aquaculture water, the pH rose between 0.5 and 1.0 in the same time. The manufacturer admits that Growstones leech silica into the water, claiming it as a ""benefit.""

Unfortunately my experience at that pH is that most plants start showing nutrient deficiencies or just being generally unhealthy.  Tomatoes, for instance, do OK but but become much more susceptible to disease.  Collard greens and other cabbage relatives become chlorotic and stunted.  Peas and strawberries shrivel and die.  Just my experience. If you manage to get things working, I'm all ears as to how.  I'd rather not just throw away the $150 I spent on this stuff."

Phase I was Growstone media.  It didn't go well.  I rinsed with reverse osmosis water overnight, drained, then filled the system with reverse osmosis water for the fishless cycle.  After getting fish in there, I tried, patiently, for four months to bring down my pH.  It was buffered to 8.4 by Growstones, I presume.  Got sick of it, and changed out the media.  After a short while, the pH did what it's supposed to do.  I am now buffering with rehardened reverse osmosis water to keep it from getting too low.  I should just throw a growstone in every once in a while /s  Anyway...  If you get that to work, it will be the first success I've heard with the stuff for aquaponics - and I've asked around.

The PH has just now came down to about 7.6.  I'm not overly concerned about the PH simply because the nitrifying bacteria do well at that range for young systems and should get more efficient as the system gets older and the PH drops (source) due to the acidifying effect of the nitrates.  I'm currently in Texas, zone 6b, getting ready to start the 100f days, so I had to wait till the cycle was almost complete before adding in my fish (otherwise the temp+ph would make the Ammonia toxic for the fix).  I also used 1 cup of seaweed extract to kick things along.  I don't have much growing in my bed ATM, but of the three things in there, two are growing almost out of control.

Other wise I would just use a radial flow filter if only doing media beds and then only if I had more than 25 or 30 tilapia sized fish. People way over think biological filtration especially in media bed systems where you have WAY more surface area in your media bed than any tiny filter. If its only a small system with a media bed or 2 I wouldn't even bother with a filter just get some worms and don't overfeed you'l be fine.

There was a time many years ago we got a batch in to play with to see if we wanted to carry it and it caused us nightmates not only does it float and shift it has major pH issues. If you want something to put in the system try phosphoric acid is the same as the acid in your soda and is food grade. You can also use hydrochloric acid as a last resort or for a really big pH issue but should only be used as a last resort.

Assuming the 5% is worst scenario, each bag of GrowStones has 350 grams of calcium carbonate ( which is REALLY BAD ).   Ideally, if you use phosphoric acid, it would take two whole bottles of something like this http://theaquaponicsource.com/shop/aquadown/aquadown-ph-lowering-solution-1-gallon/ ( each has ~180 grams of phosphoric acid ) but then you'd have a LOT of phosphate floating around + some stuff that I don't really know what the consequences would be.

aquaponics,3ddl25,erichoney07,2,Wed Jul 15 13:12:49 2015 UTC,"Eh, vinegar is safe but it's not a great solution ( no pun intended ).   I've noticed with acetic acid that there is a pH rebound.  The Acetic reacts with carbonates to create CO2 and it's the CO2 that temporarily lowers the pH until it's out gassed and then the pH rises again.  Small amounts of Muriatic or Phosphoric acid work a lot better and only require small amounts."
aquaponics,3ddl25,zynix,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:31:48 2015 UTC,"What concentrations of muriatic acid would you recommend? Those have always scared me, even though I've heard from several who use one of those two.  EDIT: That makes total sense about the ph rebound, btw. I thought it was just my grow medium, but I've since switched it out and was still having a rebound."
aquaponics,3ddl25,erichoney07,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:35:18 2015 UTC,I've only used it sparingly as I prefer phosphoric.  10-15% solutions seem ideal as you're less likely to put an excessive amount of acid into the system.

Typically I put ~5ml of phosphoric into my system a week and then check my plants for phosphate deficiency to decide if I need to add more.  It's also a lot safer than nitric or HCL for use & storage.  I've accidentally gotten 20% phosphoric splashed onto my hands and it took a layer off my skin BUT I didn't get chemical burns like I would have with nitric.  edit:  Also, something has gone terribly wrong if you need to constantly force your pH down, so after cycling the other acids are somewhat useless."

Vinegar is a chemical commonly used to lower pH. It's very mild though and is pointless in a high volume setup. I like sulfuric or hydrochloric acid. Hydrochloric acid byproducts degas, and sulfuric acid byproducts are just extra trace nutrient load. Phosphoric acid is useful for this too, but is way too weak for my taste."

aquaponics,3ddl25,paradoxbomb,1 point,Thu Jul 16 01:08:48 2015 UTC,"After all of your great advise and information I have decided to go pick up some hydroton. Before I'd do I figured I would let you in on how the testing went.  First I tried a couple of water changes to see if I could flush it out. no dice.  I don't have any fish, bacteria, or plants yet so if figured I would give white vinegar a try.  There were about 75 gallons in the tank when the bed was empty so I guesstimated I would need 1 1/2 cups. It worked like a champ (6.5)but as I was told in the comments below it was back to 9 the next day.  Next step was to follow the manufactures instructions. I took out my bell siphon and let the bed fill to the stand pipe level.  I removed the dry top layer and threw them in a large planter I had. I then adjusted the pH with white vinager to a slightly acidic 6.0 and soaked all the stones overnight.  After 10 hours we were at 7.5. After 24 hours still 7.5. Even though it has appeared to level off I have decided I am going to switch to hydroton. Mostly based off of the information in the information data sheet provided by Zynix. It just doesn't seem like the best option given all of the facts.  I am sure I can find a way to reuse them for a different purpose."

aquaponics,3ddl25,Optimoprimo,3,Wed Jul 15 15:22:23 2015 UTC,"RO as a water addition is fine, but not as a replacement. It will cause crashes in your carbonate, pH swings, spikes in nitrite, and loss of micronutrients. If the source of the buffer is still present, then any corrective action is futile anyway. The growstones need to be removed, replaced with an inert media, and the issue should go away through nitrification."
aquaponics,3ddl25,PotentPonics,2,Wed Jul 15 16:20:42 2015 UTC,Thats not the problem. The problem is it has 0 minerals in it and will not only strip stuff out of your plants and fish it also can really mess up your chemistry balance. You never want to use it unless MAYBE you have fracking near you. It just makes way to many imbalances and causes to many issues.
aquaponics,3ddwp7,memius,2,Wed Jul 15 14:44:28 2015 UTC,"Sounds clogged. Siphons depend on excellent air flow. Might just need to all be cleaned out. You can also just ever so slightly raise your flow rate, this will keep the loop from reaching the equilibrium where it trickles out at the rate it fills, allowing the siphon to kick."
aquaponics,3ddwp7,Optimoprimo,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:34:32 2015 UTC,"I wanted to raise the fish tank a little, to improve the gravity drop into the first medium bed, but the pump only pumps .095 meters. I might also throw out the second medium bed, to improve the drop. Otherwise, I might need to buy a second pump, which I would prefer not to do. Pumps are expensive here in Norway. I guess that leaves me with cleaning it all out to improve the water flow."
aquaponics,3ddwp7,Optimoprimo,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:53:14 2015 UTC,"Didn't realize you were already at max flow! Then yes you could probably just pop it off and give it a cleaning. Shouldn't be too bad. Don't go with two pumps it's just asking for problems. You could also try re maneuvering the pipe so it has a literal ""loop"" in it. Sometimes this gives the water just enough resistance to kick the siphon as well. Also make sure the tube is getting air at the outflow: it should be hanging over the media, not sitting inside it."
aquaponics,3ddwp7,zynix,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:59:51 2015 UTC,"Grab a 2"" or larger PVC pipe, cut it in half, bedazzle it with holes smaller than your media, put that in front of the loop syphon bulkhead/inlet.  Cover the top of the pipe with a lid to block out light.  You need to backflush your loop out as it is definitely clogged because you didn't have a media shield blocking it.  Grab some dark plastic, construction paper, something/anything non metallic and cover the sun facing sides of your beds.  A few of the bacteria that make up AP's biofilter are photophobic + those sun exposed areas will gum up with algae.  That bottom bed may not do so well for growing plants as it doesn't loot like it has much sun exposure.  Finally, get another large diameter PVC pipe ( larger than your intake pipe ), cut a short ~2"" long piece and bury it under your inlet pipe.  Ideally try and keep as much media out of it as possible.   Put your inlet in there to avoid exposing water to the surface of your bed.  http://imgur.com/a/ERKMm"

aquaponics,3d9itm,DeckFarmer,5,Tue Jul 14 15:39:26 2015 UTC,"That flood cycle is probably fine. Unless your grow bed is really 2 inches by 4 inches ;-). For what it's worth, though, there are lots of ways to tweak your siphon to get a longer fill time. I'm assuming you're using a bell siphon? And if you decrease the flow (to increase the time between cycles) the siphon won't break? Wouldn't it be the other way around? Usually, decreasing your flow coming into a grow bed makes a siphon have a harder time starting, but easier to stop. Increasing flow does the opposite.  If you're decreasing the flow and having a hard time getting the siphon to kick in, you can add a 90 elbow bend at the exit of the standpipe. Put a few more inches of PVC going horizontally. Basically, you're just trying to slightly increase the back pressure once the water starts flowing down the pipe to give enough resistance for it to create a vacuum and kick in. There are endless ways you can fiddle with the exit pipe for the PVC to get the siphon to work well with whatever timing cycle you have."
aquaponics,3d9itm,HerrRosenberg,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:22:27 2015 UTC,You are right I am using a bell siphon and if the flow is too low I am having trouble getting the siphon to kick in. I do have an elbow on the end with a couple feet of PVC but it wasn't doing the trick.
aquaponics,3d9itm,HerrRosenberg,1 point,Wed Jul 15 13:08:25 2015 UTC,"Hmm. Yeah, you could try adding another bend, perhaps. or, on mine, I have a horizontal tube with venturi holes (holes drilled along the tube which help with aeration of the water during the drain cycle) with a final 90 degree elbow i pointed straight up at the end but I drilled a drainage hole on the bottom side of it so water doesn't stay standing in the tube.

Fish waste can't provide all the nutrients to grow all the fish's food, and to grow the fish: Conservation of mass. Plus, fish are a higher trophic level than plants, it takes 10x the energy to grow the plants as it does to grow the fish, ergo you need 10x the mass of plants. So you'll need 1000 lbs of duckweed to grow 100 lbs of fish. Duckweed grows on a paper thin layer on top of the water, you'll need a lot of space to support 100 lbs of fish."

If you're into this stuff I can highly recommend this textbook.   If you really want a high functioning AQ system it might be worth the effort to understand some basic ecology - flows of energy and nutrients up through trophic levels. Like, you might get the idea to grow algae in a huge tank and feed it to plankton, and feed the plankton to fish. Is it worth it? With some mass balance equations and a grasp of ecological stoichiometry you can figure it out.

Ecology corollary to the second law of thermodynamics: it takes at least 10 times the space to grow enough plants as it does to grow the amount of animals it would feed. Unless you really, really oversized your fish grow space, you'll need a lot more space to grow their food.  Sorry, I know this isn't a post for eggheads, but some rules of thumb I hear drive me crazy if the math doesn't work. It's better to buy food, or grow it from detritus using soldier flies, than to use it your valuable sunlight space growing fish food. Also, 1st law of thermodynamics, conservation of mass: if you close the nutrient loop between fish and duckweed, you've got no fertilizer left for your vegetables, and you'll still have to add fertilizer to make up for the nutrients your fish remove from the system by adding mass."

Duckweed can't pull it out of the air, although some other plants can.   I'm all for slapping things together and seeing how it goes. I'm a bit of a redneck engineer myself.

Is this an analogue to the conversion from ammonia to nitrates that plants can use in the grow beds?   I managed to get a site visit to an old treatment plant that had primary separation and aerobic digestion, then secondary treatment in a trickling filter, then was blasted with UV and then used to irrigate fields to grow hay for a financial loss. The only thing that made them money was the beef cattle who were eating out the corners of the fields.   It seemed that growing slime and hay weren't profitable activities and that it was a shame that the nutrients weren't being converted into something with greater economic value.   Are there known ways of treating pharmaceutical contamination of waste streams? Or if they are absorbed and broken down by plants that can be grown in media beds?  Are there plants that will selectively absorb heavy metal contamination?   I remember being taught about bioaccumulation specifically in oysters, and wondering would there be a time when we would harvest oysters for their heavy metals?   Finally what pathogens are likely to get past a UV blasting?"
aquaponics,3d82pv,backgammon_no,1 point,Wed Jul 15 12:54:31 2015 UTC,"Yes, removing ""nitrogen oxygen demand"" means oxidizing ammonia and other organic N to nitrate.  There are definitely ways to remove pharmaceuticals and pathogens for certain, but the higher standard you treat it to, the more expensive. It's usually cheaper to treat it to the minimum standard and dump it in a lake than to clean it up to the point we can use it beneficially. Also, to compete with traditional crops, you're going to have to put disclaimers and restrictions on products fertilized with human waste, which is going to reduce your profit.  We already use wastewater treatment sludge, and effluent to fertilize food crops, but it's falling out of favor because of the above issues. Running it through an hydroponic setup is basically the same, but with a higher ""ick"" factor due to the lack of soil. It'd probably be about as safe as what we already do, but that doesn't mean it's safe."
aquaponics,3d82pv,forgottenpasswords78,2,Wed Jul 15 13:49:03 2015 UTC,Are there aquatic plants that fix N? Or do we have to rely on legumes? Do legumes even work for aquaponics?
aquaponics,3d82pv,backgammon_no,2,Wed Jul 15 12:15:30 2015 UTC,I was stretching a bit - there are algae that fix N but they are also often toxic. Here's a good review

aquaponics,3d7lak,awayshallfade,8,Tue Jul 14 03:29:28 2015 UTC,"You asked for it, so get ready to read or I typed all this for nothing I guess. You sound like I did in the beginning, fuck learning the science...lets get this shit up and working with as little reading/spending money/commitment as possible This is about everything I have learned from being a lazy, broke, dumbass and if you too are either of these... this is the guide for you!  So if youre talking about the  big black rubbermaid totes (usually used to water livestock) theyre gonna set you back a bit unless you can score one on craigslist or something. Dont buy it off CL unless they let you fill it with water to make sure it doesnt leak. There is a good possibility it will leak because youre probably gonna buy it off someone who had it sitting out in their yard cooking under the sun unused for years. If it does leak, dont think you will reliably silicone seal that shit up either. They are about 60-100 bucks new from Tractor Supply iirc. Lowes/Home Depot dont have them, lots of places will give you a blank stare if you ask for them.    You can probably build a wooden box lined with pond liner much cheaper and it will look nicer if you take your time. If you dont have a chop saw, youre lazy or you dont have a truck to haul it back and need to cram it in your sedan, a good lumber yard will be happy to cut everything to length for you. 2x4s for the box, 2x6 for the legs if you need it to stand. Drywall screws are your friend. Might wanna use hefty nuts and bolts for securing legs or the frame. Yes, everyone uses the totes and I know you wanna stick with familiar shit you have seen but all you need is something to hold water/plants and fish.    Expect to spend money on trial and error too. Youre gonna buy shit you dont need just to get everything to work right for your particular custom setup.   Pea gravel is probably  the cheapest grow media that I know of, it works fine as long as you spend all day rinsing it. It wont be clean, dont be lazy about it either. Seriously, dont be lazy about rinsing that shit thoroughly or you will have gray murky water that you cant use. When you think youre done rinsing it ...rinse it some more! Learn from my mistake! Also if you use pea gravel that will raise your PH and you probably wont be able to lower it reliably. Some plants like high pH, some dont. Most fish do just fine in it. Expect your pH to be like 7.8-8.5ish. Some of the bowtie/pocket protector geeks in here will throw a shit fit about that level. It works fine, dont trip too much.  Dont bother with chemicals to lower/raise ph. Waste of money and potentially harmful to fish. Seriously... another mistake of mine.  EcoPlus pumps are beasts and they are cheap on Amazon. I have abused the shit out of them and they wont die.  If you go with EcoPlus pumps you might like this kind of hose it stays put and is durable. The pumps come with 1/2in to 3/4in adapters. Do not lose them! They work with this kind of hose so well.   Some people like to use sumps and reservoirs , not really required though. Not saying they dont add benefit but save your money.   Your bell siphon doesnt have to be complicated either. Just study the bare essentials to get it to work. Some people like to stick airline hose and fancy shit in it to make it work better, maybe it does..... but it also works fine without all that fancy shit. Just make sure its not cycling too fast.  Feeder fish work fine as fish, not much good for eating obviously. They are cheap but most local fish stores or petsmart/petco give zero fucks about caring for them properly so expect at least a 1/4 of them to die within a day or two.   So why go with feeder fish? When you realize you cant afford or feasibly house 150 tilapia from fry to adult you'll stoop to this humble reality. Most places that sell edible fish arent interested in parting with 10-15 of them. You can try your luck on ebay but I was never brave enough to trust getting fish shipped to my house.  PVC for piping/fittings, cheap as fuck if you go to the right place. Avoid big box stores for it and try to find a local plumbing/irrigation store, they have a better conscience about the markup of these items and are less likely to rip you off. They buy that shit for pennies and try and sell it well over 500% over cost, the margins are ridiculous. Dont be lazy and just dry fit everything. It will leak. Use that PVC pipe weld shit. Plumbers tape is your friend too. Dont let shit leak or it will cause damage/mess to whatever this is all sitting on very quickly plus AP is supposed to save water.... not waste it. If you need a tight seal around the hole where your bell siphon drains down through, use a couple of threaded pvc couplers designed for pvc electrical conduit with rubber washer on each side. For some reason you can tighten those fitting waaaay better than ones designed for plumbing.... Or not fuck with any of that and do it the right way with these . Order them online, dont bother trying to find them in stores. Make sure you know your inner/outer diameters of the hole. Just know if you do use uniseals, you are not getting that pipe out of the seal unless you cut it out.  I suggest going with tomatos first time around, they are soooo forgiving and expect an impressive yield. If you grow cherry/grape tomatos, prepare to have a lots of yield.... No seriously, its gonna be a fucking mess!  Duckweed is the shit, grows fast, cleans your water, floats on the top of the water so it doesnt clog your pump and fish love to munch it. If you play your cards right you may never need to feed your fish since the fast growing duckweed will handle that for you. Also found on amazon really cheap (They should give me a giftcard for all of this free advertising)  Some other stuff not to waste your money on: Lady bugs and praying mantids. They wont stick around for too long. Worms arent a bad idea though, just wash off any of the dirt them came in or it will mold your shit up.  Look to see if there is a Tap Plastics store in your area too.... they can build you anything out of plastic if need be.  I cant think of anything else but I hope this will provide some insight."

aquaponics,3d7lak,xnonamefacex,2,Tue Jul 14 20:20:46 2015 UTC,"If you're really wanting to start with a cheap and reliable system, why not start with Constant Flood beds instead of Flood and Drain?    The siphons work great, until they don't, and your beds overflow.  With just a standpipe there is even less to go wrong.  I would seriously research the CF method if you're concerned about reliability."
aquaponics,3d7lak,xnonamefacex,1 point,Tue Jul 14 14:33:22 2015 UTC,"I did not know about the CF system, so thank you! Doesn't the constant pumping use up a lot of energy though? Especially if it's an indoor system?"
aquaponics,3d7lak,Caseycrowe,2,Tue Jul 14 18:10:15 2015 UTC,"Using the pump linked in the other comment, the EcoPlus. www.amazon.com/EcoPlus-728310-Submersible-Pump-396GPH/ It says it takes 36W. Some quick math to get that to real useable numbers: 36W x 24Hours / 1000 = 0.864kWh per day x ($0.10/kWh) = $0.0864 cents/day x 30 days = $2.59 per month  (I think my math is all right here but someone can correct me if it is wrong.  It might be.)  You can also run a timed flood, where say you constantly flood for 15-20 minutes letting it overflow the top of the stand pipe, and also have small holes drilled in the bottom of the stand pipe so that it ""drains"" over the 40 minutes or so that you have the pump off.  small enough that they don't drain the bed while the pump is on though, you want that flowing over the top of the standpipe. And you still don't have to deal with finicky siphons that way.  But that is getting down into all the details the large comment from /u/I_Dont_Get_Your_Joke says to ignore.  I agree with him.  I say build it as constant flood first, and if that isn't working out for you, stick a bell over the stand pipe and BOOM you've got flood and drain."

Rapid pH changes will stress your fish out to the point where they die.     #1 get the MSDS for the agri lime you bought.  The store you bought it at should have it, if not then check the manufacturers website ( if they have one ).  There can be a few additives put into agri lime that may be problematic ( check CAS #'s and research named additives ).  #2 Grab a 1 gallon ( 4 liter ) bottle. Put ~1-2 grams * of your agri lime into the bottle, shake it up, take 5-10 ml of that and throw it into the system.  Wait ~1-2 hours, check pH.  Shake bottle again, add 5 more ml in, repeat until your pH moves up as fractional amount ( if you can get all 4 API test vials, do a pH test, leave it, use next vial for the next pH test - this helps you see pH progression ).     #3 Go slow in small amounts.

aquaponics,3cstdm,ctoatb,2,Sat Jul 11 03:46:36 2015 UTC,It just depends on how much fish you will have in the system. If your only planning on a handful of fish there waste wont over come your worm population if your only trying to feed the plants. If you want to get high fish production out of your system or want rafts you need some kind of solids separation. potting or fabric bagging your plants can also greatly help in reducing root clogging. I have most of my plants in fabric bags now for this reason. Plus I can move them easily at will which is nice when you have a big grow.

Downside is that they use pretty much everything that's not large enough to feed humans.   Real risks come from Omega 3 oils as those do depend on larger specimens ( including whale sharks ).

Bio accumulation of mercury in fish feeds is not a problem since most of the fish meal comes from low-trophic chain species such as the Peruvian anchovy and in some cases from fish trimmings.   Carnivorous marine fish are sold directly to us as food. They are too valuable and scarce to be used in aquafeeds.   In any case, industrial aquafeeds from reputable manufacturers contain full descriptions of the ingredients used and many of them have full traceability. This brings me to a ""aha!"" moment: pet fish feed is not bound to the same standards and aquafeeds. Which means all these hobbyists are actually relying on substandard feeds!....   Damn....

See if you can get a water sample and do a quick chemistry test (Nitrate, Ammonia, pH and dkH would be plenty). That will tell you how healthy the system is. If it's had fish for years, I'd imagine it's much more managed than you think. If there are significant nitrates present, then you can definitely grow a few plants with it. Be careful introducing weeds like eloda or duckweed. They grow like crazy and the fish don't always manage the growth. They can consume a pond in weeks and suffocate the fish.

The porosity of sand is as around 25% and hydroton is +40%. It is impossible that sand has a higher void fraction than hydroton. Test: fill up a jar with hydroton and sand. Which granules form the voids and which granules fill those voids?   2) The ""much more effective"" mechanical filtration does not mean anything at all. Better mechanical filtration means that the sand bed captures solids rapidly and therefore, will also clog rapidly. The high efficiency of granular filters is also their main drawback.   3) Vastly increased aeration. Aeration occurs by a pressure difference and an aeration device must ensure that the two fluids with the two different partial pressures for a given gas are in contact. For this you need a large contact area between are and water. A sand bed does not offer that, therefore it cannot offer ""vastly increased aeration"". This is again because the space that should be occupied by the air/water mixture is actually occupied by grains of sand. If anything, sand beds are known for becoming anoxic.   4) what the fuck is ""micro-cellular"" uptake of Oxygen?   5) 210,000 ppm Oxigen concentration?? What the flying fuck? High pressure systems in industrial aquaculture can reach 100 ppm AT MUCH  These people are just using slow sand filtration as an aquaponic substrate and we know that slow sand filtration, although efficient and cheap, just cannot cope with high loading in aquaculture without enslaving you into monitor it and clean it all the time."

aquaponics,3cmrl3,Pastelitomaracucho,2,Sun Jul 12 18:55:25 2015 UTC,"Tilapia will work just fine. Just be prepared to tray your fish for any taint (muddy flavour). They can develop this in recirculating systems and the like.   You get rid of the taint by putting the fish off-feed in a clean tank with clean water. Change clean water once a day for 3-7 days and dont feed the fish.   I have tried plenty of tilapia sushi. Not mindblowing, but OK."

aquaponics,3cmrl3,zynix,1 point,Thu Jul 9 15:23:37 2015 UTC,"Hey had another question and you seem like you would know the answer.   Came across a way of dispatching fish for harvest that was supposed to be super humane.  Commenter said to put the fish in a gallon baggie 1/2 filled with water, and put it in the freezer. Supposedly will just put them to sleep then die.   I was wondering, assuming this is a humane way to kill the fish, wouldn't this be super beneficial for sushi and the freshness of the fish? Keep it frozen until ready to fillet it?"
aquaponics,3cmrl3,Cambium29,1 point,Sun Jul 12 18:52:37 2015 UTC,"First, this is not, by any means, humane. Yes, shock chilling is being done industrially with some species because they haven't found a better way to do it, but we know it is not the best way.   Fish like this will experience a slow and stressful death and this is known.   Freshness is another issue. Recently harvested fish can be frozen and used later and it will still be fresh. However, slow freezing will create ice crystals in the muscle, destroy the fibers and voila, the fish is just not sashimi quality anymore. It will be fresh tho.   Harvested fish can be put on ice flakes for up to two days and will conserve perfect quality as long as there is enough ice and the fish packed with styrofoam.   The most recognized ways of dispatching a fish humanely are by percussive stunning or electrocution, followed by bleeding. In the case of a tilapia, you will have to whack it in the head and then proceed to cut the main artery going into through the gills.   Another technique used if fish caught for sushi is called Ike Jime. With this technique, a spike is introduced in the brain. This technique ensures immediate brain death, but it is quite impressive to watch a fish die like this in my own experience. Following spiking, both arteries in the gills and the tail are severed. The fish, although brain dead, pumps all the blood out.   You can leave the fish in ice water during bleeding.   In my opinion, considering that your fish were raised safely, is the best way to enjoy sashimi-grade fish."

aquaponics,3clacc,Optimoprimo,1 point,Wed Jul 8 21:58:34 2015 UTC,"If you have an auto siphon, then that controls your flood and drain cycles. Having the pump turn on and off with a siphon is redundant and leaves you with these weird limbo times when your growbed is partially full or sits completely drained for a while."
aquaponics,3clacc,Optimoprimo,1 point,Wed Jul 8 23:12:11 2015 UTC,"So somehow there will always be enough water left in the sump to pump into the fish tanks?  It seems like a strange equilibrium problem.  If both auto siphons sync up and both beds fill at the same time. during this time no new water is being added to the sump.  and the pump is running continuously, couldn't at some point the sump run dry?  Or alternatively, if the sump has a ton of water in it to avoid ever running dry, couldn't at some point both the auto siphons dump at the same time, overflowing the sump?"
aquaponics,3clacc,charizzardd,1 point,Wed Jul 8 23:29:00 2015 UTC,"If your sump ever gets so low that your pump runs out, then you don't have enough water in your system. The water fluctuates in the sump and that's the point, but it's lowest level should be well above the pump level. It never empties completely."
aquaponics,3clacc,charizzardd,1 point,Wed Jul 8 23:35:36 2015 UTC,yeah basically your sump tank should be at least bigger than the grow bed water volume so while the grow bed fills up you still have water in your sump tank. Some systems use around double or more in the sump so you have a full reservoir even when the grow bed is almost ready to siphon.

aquaponics,3clacc,zynix,1 point,Thu Jul 9 15:54:14 2015 UTC,Well you could figure out a level of flood for the tubs that works. With grow bed media and filling each tub say half way up you could probably do it.

aquaponics,3cheuz,Simple_Tymes,1 point,Wed Jul 8 03:29:25 2015 UTC,While 2 of the plants are in wicking bed pots the rest are in dual root zone setups. I am not happy with the wicking bed plants compared to our normal size by now I think its not getting enough gas exchange in the roots compared to the dual root zone setup. It is also a way bigger head ache to dose more nutrients because it leaks out of the cloth pots. I won't be doing this again and will be sticking to the dual root zone planting this was just a test.
aquaponics,3cheuz,kimocal916,1 point,Wed Jul 8 17:47:05 2015 UTC,"What's a dual root zone setup? Never heard of that. As for adding fertilizers, absolutely, it's impossible to use anything serious without harming the fish. I use osmocote plus in the bags and it works well but the fertilizer is not nearly as aggressive it could be."
aquaponics,3cheuz,kimocal916,1 point,Wed Jul 8 21:42:29 2015 UTC,http://www.hightimes.com/read/grow-hack-how-build-aquaponics-system  Basically you have a soil layer that can be amended as needed that works like a sponge to hold nutrients in the root system but outside of the fish water. This lets you boost as needed with out effecting the fish. As far as NPK you can get those to hydro levels with little issue to the fish but micros start to become a big issue zinc especially. Using dual root zoneing you not only get the benefit of the nutrients being available in the soil and water but the biodiversity that comes along with each separate ecosystem. You get your aquatic microbes and your terrestrial microbes both on the same root system. No other growing method does that.

aquaponics,3cheuz,ArgonWilde,1 point,Thu Jul 9 23:44:12 2015 UTC,its fairly hard to kill as long as it has water. Hops is also a good option for that setup if your into home brewing. It seems to grow best so far in wicking beds.
aquaponics,3chskj,Unsocialseaman,5,Wed Jul 8 00:37:54 2015 UTC,"Start small.  If you can get one IBC system running (which is still a 200-ish setup,) and maintain it, it should inform you about the rest of the process so you don't invest muti-thousands into something you have no practical experience with.    It'll also help to have that first IBC when you want to propagate the larger system because you'll have all your bacterial cultures right there, and you can syphon several gallons of water and some grow media straight into the new one to kick it off."

It's been going for 5 years in my kitchen/living room area.   Everything gets magnified with smaller systems, the room for error is tiny. That's both annoying but also a good way to learn. I've been able to transfer that knowledge to my much, much larger system outdoors and feel confident that the process works.  There are some really small, desktop aquaponic systems out there--""cuteponics""--that are a good way to dip a toe.

Goldfish and minnows are powering my 20 gallon indoor system right now and they provide plenty of nutrients for two full beds of plants. I sometimes hit the system with a shot of seaweed extract when the veggies are full on.  I'm curious about what you found, but too lazy efficient to look it up."

aquaponics,3chskj,DavidSlain,4,Fri Jul 10 13:43:31 2015 UTC,"Do NOT go big with your first system  Aquaponics takes a lot of experimenting. What works for someone on the West Coast will not work for me on the high plains, nor will it work for you in Florida. There's a lot to consider, a lot to learn, and you will have some successes at first, but a lot of screw-ups, too. Sinking several hundred, or even several thousand dollars--and a whole bunch of time and effort--into a new hobby is just going to lead to frustration. Don't put yourself there.  Get a few books, watch some online videos, and join some community boards; you'll learn a lot. Ask questions, but also, keep in mind that your particular situation is going to be unique. What works for me will not work for you, vice-versa.  It's a great hobby but it does take some intense hands-on effort the first season or three to get everything working right. Once you get it going and stable, it's really just maintenance and fine-tuning--that's the fun stuff."
aquaponics,3cgtei,deweydb,7,Tue Jul 7 20:15:14 2015 UTC,"Usually old bathtubs, depending on how old they are of course, are enameled. They could be metal with an enamel coating which of course is inert and food safe. There are plastic tubs, some of which are cheap and nasty made of materials that are not food safe and then the better quality fibreglass bathtubs are quite good. Once again, if you’re going to use recycled materials you need to find out what kind of material it is and if you have any doubt do not use it! Simple as that.   Seems that he doesn't have a problem with bathtubs being used as a jumpstart for your system, he just warns against using the cheapo plastic ones, and if they're metal, make sure the enamel coating is still intact.  The point he keeps repeating is that there are a lot of materials that leach undesirable and toxic chemicals over time, which you end up ingesting via your fish and your plants.   Pretty much everyone into aquaponics would also warn against repurposed barrels/IBC's and whatnot that you find at a garbage dump simply because you don't know what was in that barrel before you got it.  Coulda been water, coulda been gasoline."
aquaponics,3cgtei,DavidSlain,2,Tue Jul 7 20:51:21 2015 UTC,"Yeah, i was mostly put off my this part:   I wouldn’t want to think it would be a permanent idea but it’s certainly a good way to get started and to just feel how it goes and how it works and to just see if you can do at your place. Most people that we’ve encountered that start down the bath tub route, end up upgrading to something better and that’s not a bad way to go.   I don't really get why they would need to be replaced.  I found a brand new fiberglass tub that someone is giving away for free on craigslist.  And i just don't want to get too far along before i realize the reason that people would want to replace it eventually."
aquaponics,3cgtei,DavidSlain,4,Tue Jul 7 21:13:02 2015 UTC,"They wouldn't need to be replaced if they're a high quality tub- his own purpose-made growbeds are fiberglass.  He's just saying that most people he knows that start with tubs end up upgrading to a 'better' vessel.    This could be for any number of reasons, but most likely is that they needed more planting space, and a bathtub won't cut it anymore.  I, personally, might start with a tub as a growbed, but I know it'll only support a small-ish fishtank.  I'd rather jump to something IBC sized right away if I can get an IBC for the same price as a tub (and save on the price of the fish tank as well!)  But still, can't argue with free, if that's how you get your bathtub.  'Better' could also mean aesthetically, if you ever show off your system to someone else, well, it's a conversation something along the lines of:  ""Hey, look what I grew plants in!""  ""Is- is that a bathtub?""  ""Yep, awesome ain't it?""  ""Umm... sure.  Why a bathtub?""  ""Well, it's partially because of recycling, partially because of...""  This kind of conversation isn't one I mind having, but some other people might find it offputting, like trying to explain why baby food in a recipe that won on food network not only isn't a big deal, but is probably better for you than alternatives. (No preservatives, purer ingredients, and so on.)  Some people just get put off by things not being used how they expect, and there's a certain stigma applied to objects.  Like using a toilet tank floating device to keep water at a consistent level in your AP system, some people just don't get it.  To them, it's baby food, it's a toilet, it's a bathtub, and they can't see beyond that.  And then tell them that the salad they're eating is fertilized with fish poop.  Seriously."

aquaponics,3cdsvf,6_seeds,1 point,Tue Jul 7 14:52:51 2015 UTC,They are a lot more demanding of nutes than herbs and lettuces are. So you'll need a generally a higher ppm and a far great amount of P than aquaponics provides: the best ideas I've seen for this are 1) separating the plant and fish water systems and introducing extra nutes 2) creating a dual root zone system and 3) 'injecting' extra nutes at the root zone such that it's not getting into the water cycle.

Remember to read on the nitrogen cycle and ensure beneficial bacteria takes over before adding fish. I may even recommend using a dozen goldfish feeders (cost 30 cents in any fish store).

aquaponics,3bsy6n,MilkCurds,6,Wed Jul 1 22:07:04 2015 UTC,"Surprised no one has mentioned this yet (Focuskids has to some degree), but fish are cold-blooded which means diseases that affect fish will not transfer over to a warm-blooded human. Exceptions to this rule are reptiles+amphibians as their skin can carry salmonella. Lastly, fish release ammonia in a water soluble form through their gills not just through their digestive tract. This makes it more bioavailable."
aquaponics,3bsy6n,ctoatb,1 point,Thu Jul 2 00:45:07 2015 UTC,Maybe its been awhile since my zoology degree but I was under the impression that most fish were ectothermic poikilotherms. There are some ectothermic homeotherms but they are unlike endotherms due to their thermal regulation coming from behavioural traits (e.g. Tuna can have constantly higher temperature in cold waters due to muscle contraction producing heat).  Maybe I should've said 'ectotherms' instead of 'cold blooded' but I thought for the scope of the question the layman's term would suffice. Feel free to correct me if I'm wrong though.

aquaponics,3bktsc,gammalbjorn,2,Tue Jun 30 01:13:40 2015 UTC,"I actually do it some time ago, as  yourself, i wanted a simple, compact and very simple system.  My system size its about 1.5m x .60m, and each tank are above each other, fish tank have 44cm depth and plant tank about 35 - 40 cm.  I used at the beginning a DWC raft because its very easy to make... and the system will be kept simple and with not too much weigh. I also had a Radial Flow Filter made from a 20lt container. It was OK and the rafts grow some lettuce without problems. After some time, i decided to let go my DWC raft and put some media, because of this:   I have a lot of fish and my filtration wasnt good enough, my plants were getting some solids traped in the roots. Water was very murky. I didnt have enough nitrobacteria, so my ammonia an nitrites were high. I wanted to put some bigger plants like tomatoes and cucumbers, so the DWC wasnt ideal.   Afther changing to hydroton, i get a lot better mechanical an biological filtration... it was a good decision.  DWC can work for you, but keep in mind that you are not going to have a good filtration, so you should stock low with your fish or add a very good filter.  About the OnTop of fish tank configuration, im very happy with it because the overall system its small and you can get some extra aeration if you take aproach of falling water to the fish tank. I only use a 24w pump and i can mantain around 15 tilapia, lot of plants without air pump."

Doing water changes in an AP system completely screws up the beautiful balance and core philosophy of AP.  Saving the water just seems asinine.

aquaponics,3bfk73,Alacritous,1 point,Mon Jun 29 03:18:25 2015 UTC,"Just had a few other thoughts.  Do you have something that disturbs the water a lot? Does your infeed drop a fair distance? solids will usually precipitate out so if you've got something disturbing your water it'll stay murky.  The setup I tried was an indoor one and I didn't' have enough grow lights to really get it going very well, but I had 18 gold fish living in it and all I did was cycle the water through the grow bed. It was in an IBC set up like this  http://i.imgur.com/hKirMKx.jpg  I had the infeed from the grow bed streaming against the back of the tank so it didn't fall directly into the water so it didn't kick up sediment from the bottom.  and my pump intake was directly on the bottom of the tank.   My largest gold fish grew to 8 inches.  from the dinky little 49 cent ones you can buy at pet stores.   It was just a little side project I had going more as a proof of concept for me to fiddle with."

Another possibility that I haven't tested and can't say is safe would be http://www.apifishcare.com/product.php?p=details&id=547 You would need to contact API/Mars and see what they say on it being GRAS.

My understanding for why cannabis is not farmed on a significant level with aquaponics, is because you can't dial the nutes in the way you can with hydro, or even soil.  In theory, you could try to control your nutrient ratios by manipulating the species of vegetation in your system prior to your bed with the cannabis in it.  However, since your cannabis is your primary crop, I'd advise keeping them in a media bed early on in the system, for maximum nutrients.  Aquaponics is a great way to grow things like greens, because the primary nute required is Nitrogen (nitrite, nitrate derivatives) from the bacteria. But as we know the primary macro nutrients for flowering is more heavily P&K, which is less present in aquaponics."
aquaponics,3bcikp,PotentPonics,1 point,Sun Jun 28 17:58:06 2015 UTC,"Most of the people I know who grow professionally instantly recognizes I am not growing weed when I say I am doing aquaponics.  Major difference is that thanks to hydro's run to drain + separate germination allows a skilled grower to be up and running in a fairly short time period.  Meanwhile with AP, it really doesn't spool up to maximum performance for 4-6 months as various bacteria move in, colonize, and reach equilibrium.     One mapped strain of nitrosomonas ( europaea I believe ) depends heavily on iron but has no means to directly utilize it without yet another bacteria.   Additionally the difference of pH between the fish and plants can put AP weed behind hydro.  That all said, AP has the advantage over hydro as you can produce your own nitrates ( via fish ) and in a hybrid setup, water from AP can go into a wicking bed which would open up the rest of the growing options for food production while hydro run off has a bit too many salts, metals, and anti-bacterial compounds  in it ( eg sodium hydroxide/chloride, citric acid, hydrogen peroxide, and likely more ).  The one aquaponic setup I know off uses mostly compost and some Koi in a long run to drain setup ( AP cycles building up nitrates, that is flushed into a reservoir which runs in hydroponics w/additives, and that is then drained )."

Without clicking through.  A rudimentary radial filter has water from into a round bucket with the pipe facing up.  Around this pipe is a cylinder ( or smaller bucket ) that forces the water to flow down and around the bucket to where a skimmer draws the top of the water off.  Pictures help a lot with this.  Red wiggler worms in a grow bed will expand in population until they reach a equilibrium of available waste/sediment.

They dont need much more.   Also they are fantastic grazers, if you have any dirty tanks or sumps fill of biofilm or algae, put them there. They will clean it in no time.  Best way to feed them would be with a starter feed, of course. But that is expensive and you are not growing them commercially. Powdering your feed will work, but watch out for fine solids that remains in the water.   Also, if you are planning to grow your tilapia fast, you will have to remove the females away eventually. Their growth gets stunned as they dedicate energy for reproduction. Also check that your female to male ratios are OK as you will have your tank turned into a warzone once everyone wants its share of fishpussy."

I can't say I agree long term, though at this point that's a tough one. I have a feeling that people will have to start using land efficiently. For example, can we wind farm in an undesirable, infertile plain and send that energy, along with solar energy from the desert and methane digesters, to towers in a big city?  We need to feed a bunch of hungry people, some of whom are dying of hunger.

aquaponics,3b25ms,mydogwalter,2,Thu Jun 25 10:43:28 2015 UTC,SLO is the way to go. Requires a sump tank but all systems should use one. In the case of failure or a leak somewhere in your system your fish tank cannot be drained with an SLO. Whereas if you have the pump in your tank you can come home to some dead or dying fish. I had that happen to me a few times before I finally switched to SLO and sump tank. I'd also argue for a kind of filter in between the tank and sump to remove some solids. It depends on your number of and kind of fish but I would not rely on media beds to process all that solid waste.
aquaponics,3b25ms,Whittigo,1 point,Thu Jun 25 14:59:27 2015 UTC,I think some pumps are rated for particulate.

aquaponics,3b25ms,Dr8ton,1 point,Thu Jun 25 22:28:28 2015 UTC,"took me a couple views but if i understand correctly on his, there is 2 pipes, the inner is the actual drain and causes the suction to pull the solids on the bottom into another container, and the outer tube is to have the height above the water line so it does not suck the tops of the water only the bottom"
aquaponics,3b25ms,zynix,1 point,Thu Jun 25 23:15:00 2015 UTC,"Yup, fairly clever design for requirements but I wonder if its just moving the problem a step down the line ( where does the fish waste go now and how do you separate it from the pump?  ).  Otherwise for my much simpler & smaller setups, I just keep the water turbulent and the pump pulls things up and out."
aquaponics,3b25ms,Dr8ton,1 point,Thu Jun 25 23:57:50 2015 UTC,"I think the best way I have seen this done is with an SLO (Solid Lift Overflow).   Basically, it's a drain in the bottom of the tank with a pipe attached to the drain set at the max elevation of the water level. Another pipe with a cap is placed on top of the first pipe. Slits are cut from the bottom of the pipe to allow water and solids to be lifted up the tube and spill over into the drain. This creates a suction from the bottom of the tank that cleans up solid waste as it settles out.   I think it is most effective in a tank with a conical bottom so that all  the solids collect in one area."
aquaponics,3b25ms,tightlineslandscape,1 point,Thu Jun 25 12:42:29 2015 UTC,"the slo requires a separate tank which then can be drained or cleaned separate from the system.  I got around this by adding a drain to the bottom of my fish tank with a sort of ""drain field"" design of pipes (imagine the ncaa basketball bracket but just of 16 teams and the exit of the tank is the winner of those 16 teams, confusing?). Just drilled a hole in the side wall of the tank as close to the bottom as you can and added the piping with a valve to open and close it when i want. This allows me to drain a few gallons of water directly from the bottom of the fish tank where the solids collect. You can save this water that you drained and use it in your garden as a sort of fert. Works great! you just have to spend the few extra bucks on a good fitting so it doesn't leak."

aquaponics,3b25ms,Dr8ton,1 point,Thu Jun 25 16:36:00 2015 UTC,"what creates the suction? i saw a design that had a bar air stone on top of the bent pipe with slits, so i assume the pull of air sucks into the pipe. if the exit hole for the slo is below the water line of the tank will that act like a suction to pull the bottom waste? how effective are shrimp at eating the waste in the solids tank? and then how effective is it to use those shrimp for feeding your fish."
aquaponics,3b25ms,kingkaizersauce,1 point,Thu Jun 25 23:03:22 2015 UTC,I don't think there is so much a suction as there is a flow. You are redirecting that flow from what use to be the surface to the bottom of the tank.   normally the water would just flow into the drain. You have elevated the drain which will set the level of water in the tank. When you put the second pipe on it the water now flows from the bottom to the top and then spills over.   You will have to post a pic of the air stone bent pipe thing. I have seen air stones used as AIR LIFTS but that is all I'm familiar with.

The first big scale farm I can think of that actually helped prove a large-scale aquaponics farm model is Vertis."
aquaponics,3asy2k,Spitinthacoola,2,Wed Jun 24 12:24:13 2015 UTC,"So, is ""commercial"" defined by acreage?   Is ""recent"" defined by <5 years?  It's a matter of semantics - my point is that its great to hear more about aquaponics in mainstream media but to be accurate, there are other farms that have been doing it longer.  At one point Friendly's was selling to Costco.  Mari's is now about 7 acres and is selling to Whole Foods, by the way.   They also host a $100 per head wine pairing dinner with a custom glass fishtank/table."

aquaponics,3asy2k,VermiponicsOnline,-4,Thu Jun 25 12:24:02 2015 UTC,"I think aquaponics actually has lower water use because the plants are more sheltered?(of course it doesnt help for ""mainstream"" farming shooting jets of water through the air) If you let the wind blow through the plants, the humidity becomes approximately equal to the general humidity of the air. If in contrast the air does not move much, the air among the plants gets a higher humidity, because water is evaporating there, but the air is not replaced. So the evaporation rate decreases.  So maybe it isnt aquaponics itself decreasing water use, it is keeping the humid air in, and still having that economically viable. Note that i am really just using physics intuition.."
aquaponics,3asy2k,Jasper1984,7,Tue Jun 23 15:42:18 2015 UTC,"thats a string of made up shit right there.. Air flow is very important in aquaponics, humidity levels too high slow transpiration rates and reduce plant growth..    Aquaponics uses less water because you aren't spraying it all over a goddamned field of soil where it has to soak in before the plants can even begin to use it. Most of which evaporates without ever even being in a place to be used by the plant.   Planting in AP uses less simply because you don't waste a shit ton on the outset. The Plants require X water to grow. You don't need to supply X+Y water to saturate the soil enough to provide X water since the plants are grown directly in it."

aquaponics,3asy2k,MilkCurds,1 point,Tue Jun 23 20:45:41 2015 UTC,"Right if you put it on the soil instead of in it, it has to soak and has a lot of chance to evaporate. Not clear to me why high humidity levels dont work for plant, because they then cant evaporate and use capilary action to get minerals up? (but then, how do they feed their roots, then? Probably varies with plants a lot.. shits complicated)  Anyway, just because a high humidity can hurt and it needs some airflow, doesnt mean the plants like being dessicated or sandblasted. It is berating me for not knowing shit, not showing that you actually do, otherwise, you'd say something about what sort of parameters plants actually like."
aquaponics,3asy2k,Jasper1984,2,Fri Jun 26 20:25:40 2015 UTC,"Wasn't berating you (unless you think someone calling you out on making something up is berating)  High humidity levels slow the rate the plant transpires, slowing the rate it can metabolize and grow.   while plants can control their stomata and account for changes in humidity to a certain degree, you get to a point where the plant simply can not evaporate water out of it's leaves and it stalls.   Aquaponics water savings has nothing to do with humidity near the plant and as mentioned before everything to do with not spraying it on soil and giving it up to the air.   Plants transpire and alter the local humidity regardless of where you grow.. A field of Corn in the desert will have a higher humidity in and around it then there would be out in the desert away from the irrigation source."

Radial flow filter looks a bit small. Also I'd imagine you will put something under the radial flow filter to keep it from snapping over time under the weight of the water.

Species offered by aquaculturists often include rainbow trout, striped bass, sturgeon, some of the sunfish and freshwater bait species.  While a stocking permit is generally intended for landowners who wish to stock ponds, I believe the permit would also apply to private aquariums. There are also a number of counties where a stocking permit is not required (see regulation below)  The regulations pertaining to this section are contained in the CA Code of Regulations/ Title 14, sections 235-245.  I have attached the applicable section for you.  238.5. Stocking of Aquaculture Products. Upon stocking, aquaculture products are wild and therefore “fish” as defined by Section 45 of the Fish and Game Code, except when stocked into a registered aquaculture facility. No person shall stock aquaculture products in this state except in accordance with the following general terms and conditions: (a) All aquaculture products stocked under these provisions must be legally reared or possessed by an aquaculturist registered in this state. No person shall stock aquaculture products which are parasitized, diseased or of an unauthorized species. (b) Live aquaculture products shipped to Inyo or Mono counties must be certified by the department as disease and parasite-free before being stocked in waters in those counties. (c) A registered aquaculturist producing or possessing rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss), largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides), bluegill (Lepomis macrochirus), redear sunfish (Lepomis microlophus), Sacramento perch (Archoplites interruptus), channel catfish (Ictalurus punctatus), blue catfish (Ictalurus furcatus) and white catfish (Ictalurus catus), may stock these species under the following terms and conditions. Only publicly owned lakes covered by a cooperative agreement between the department and the lake operator and privately owned reservoirs, lakes and ponds in the following counties or portions thereof may be stocked without a stocking permit: Alameda, Butte, Colusa, Contra Costa, Glenn, Imperial, Kern, except in the Kern River drainage above Democrat Dam; Kings, Lake except in the Eel River drainage; Los Angeles, Merced, Napa, Orange, Riverside, Sacramento, San Benito, San Bernardino, San Diego, San Joaquin, Santa Barbara, Solano, Stanislaus, Sutter, Tehama, Ventura, Yolo, Yuba; those portions of Amador, Calaveras, El Dorado, Mariposa, Nevada, Placer and Tuolumne west of Highway 49; Fresno west of the Sierra and Sequoia National Forest boundaries; Madera west of the Sierra National Forest boundary; and Tulare west of the Sequoia National Forest and Sequoia National Park boundaries. (d) Except for those species listed in Section 238.5(c) when planted into those specific areas and waters covered in Section 238.5(c), no person shall stock aquatic plants and animals except as follows: (1) Each stocking of fish shall require a separate Private Stocking Permit (FG 749 (Rev. 5/93), which is incorporated by reference herein) issued by the department. A copy of this permit shall accompany all shipments. However, a copy of the same permit (FG 749 (Rev. 5/93)) may be used for additional consignments of the same species when stocked in the same water or waters, until cancelled by the department. See subsection 699(b) of these regulations for the fee for this permit. (2) Application for the private stocking permit shall be made to the regional manager of the Fish and Game region in which the fish are to be stocked. An application will be supplied to each applicant upon request. (3) No person shall stock any species of fish in any water in which the stocking of such fish is contrary to the fisheries management programs of the department for that water or drainage, or in any water from which such fish might escape to other waters where such fish are not already present. All applicants will be advised upon request of the said departmental fisheries management programs. (4) Permittee shall notify the regional office of the department not less than 10 days in advance of stocking in order to make arrangements for inspection. Such inspection may be waived at the discretion of the department. If, upon inspection, diseased or parasitized fish or fish of unauthorized species are found by the department to be present, they shall be disposed of by the permittee as directed by the department. The department may require that the expense of any inspection made necessary by the provisions of these regulations be borne by the permittee. (5) A stocking permit may be cancelled or suspended by the department upon conviction of a violation of these regulations by a court of competent jurisdiction. Cancellation or suspension may be appealed to the commission. (6) A stocking permit is valid only when signed by the applicant. (e) A registered aquaculturist selling and transporting aquatic plants and animals for the purpose of stocking in this state shall retain copies of documents required by Section 15005(b) of the Fish and Game Code for a period of three years following stocking of the fish. The documents shall be shown upon written demand by the director of the department. The information contained in the documents is confidential except that such information may be disclosed in accordance with a proper judicial order in cases or actions instituted for enforcement of this section or for prosecution of violations of this section. (f) Except for Inyo, Mono, San Bernardino, Riverside and Imperial counties, mosquitofish (Gambusia affinis) may be planted for purposes of mosquito control without obtaining a permit otherwise required by these regulations. In Inyo and Mono counties and in public waters of San Bernardino, Riverside and Imperial counties, mosquitofish may not be planted without the written concurrence of the department.>"

aquaponics,3alsnn,sbuthrowawayyy,2,Sun Jun 21 13:57:01 2015 UTC,"No matter the species, you will have to thermo regulate your water. It can get expensive. Trout do indeed prefer cooler water, but not freezing water. And in the summer you might need to chill it if you can't keep the system under 72 degrees. Think of ways you can shield the system from the sun because that will be critical. Also bear in mind that trout are a much fussier species than tilapia. I don't know if I'd recommend them if this is your first rodeo. Catfish are pretty resilient and could be a good species for you.   The other unfortunate thing is that you're already kind of late in the season to be starting a system; to give you an idea, I start mine in Wisconsin with a heater about late April, and it's got 4-5ish month old tilapia added in May. They're ready to pull by late September when the heating costs start to get too high. This year has been annoyingly difficult since it's a really cold spring."
aquaponics,3alsnn,Optimoprimo,1 point,Sun Jun 21 17:57:49 2015 UTC,"Thank you, I think you're right about the trout it definitely would be expensive to regulate the temp. As for the Tilapia, maybe I could start some in 40 gallon breeders to get enough fingerlings to stock the pool next year. The only issue would be the pool would be unstocked in the winter. I wonder how feasible it would be to alternate between the two species? Harvest the Tilapia in late September, keep a few in breeders for the next year, and stock Trout in October or whenever it gets cold enough. I could use a fountain to keep the Oxygen up, but heating might not be so easy."

If you don't have plastic yet and heat is killer, just get the shadecloth first and film later I would say. In my greenhouse, it would get 20-25 degrees F warmer in the sun, with the shadecloth it only gets at most 10 degrees warmer."

aquaponics,3a9x2a,bee_rad,3,Thu Jun 18 11:42:22 2015 UTC,"Using a timer and a siphon is redundant. A siphon allows you to just pick a pump, turn it on, then forget about it. The siphon will take care of the flood and drain cycle on its own.  If you want to use a pump on a timer, you will just create a drain that releases water slower than you pump it in. Then you have the pump turn on until the water is at the desired height, then turn off.  I like siphons, personally (although I have very little experience). They allow you to use a smaller pump (it isn't competing with a drain), they eliminate the need for a timer (one less moving part to fail), and they allow you to leave the pump on 24/7 (better for pump life, the most wear and tear occurs due to frequent on/off cycles)."
aquaponics,3a9x2a,loggic,2,Thu Jun 18 17:22:25 2015 UTC,"It looks like the water would hover around and a bit above the stand pipe.  I am somewhat adverse to constant flood setups but something this small shouldn't be a problem.  For timed flood & drain, I've seen people cut a few tiny holes into the bottom of the stand pipe so that the water drains further down in between intervals.   Just keep in mind you will need some sort of pipe washer/scrubber to unclog it from time to time.  Personally I like ebb & flow using a bell syphon.  They're not that complicated and eliminates the need for having a timer.  I've heard some claims that timed flood & drain will diminish the lifespan of the pump but my own equipment usually fails in some other way before the motor even gets a chance to die."
aquaponics,3a9x2a,zynix,2,Thu Jun 18 12:09:20 2015 UTC,"I have this setup with an aquarium and a plastic tub, rather than a barrel, but the concept is the same.  There are a few millimeters of water left in the bottom, but it's never been a problem.  I run my irrigation pump for the first 15 minutes of every hour, and my first planting with this setup just sprouted.  (before that it was a constant flow without a bell siphon.  I've tried a few times and was never very successful at getting the siphon to work.)"
aquaponics,3a9x2a,csbingel,2,Thu Jun 18 16:09:06 2015 UTC,"My smaller AP's are more voodoo than science with siphons.  Just to clarify; with your setup, do you have drain holes at the bottom of the pipe?"

Underneath, it's also just thread, with a scrap piece of 2"" PVC (that was supposed to be the outer part of my siphon) wedged against it to control splashing.  I don't have the media screen that the OP's picture showed, I just let the media lay on top of it, and if it gets blocked, I just reach in and move the media (in my case river rock) around."

I would suggest the T shaped that they don't have a tutorial for only because the i shape really doesn't give much growbed.. buts it's up to you.  As for draining... I purchased an Eb and Flow kit from my local hydroponic store and install the lower drain to the pump and the higher drain... well... drained into the fishtank below. I ran constant flood but if the pump shut off the whole bed would drain through the lower drain, effectively draining the growbed completely. Should work out fine for a beginner system. My fish ended up dying but most likely due to haywire temperatures."

aquaponics,3a7upf,MrMalamat,2,Wed Jun 17 23:07:39 2015 UTC,"When you look at the cost of microgreens and the nutritional punch they pack, you are definitely on the right track! When I see other consulting businesses selling their system designs, they always falter a bit when it comes to long-term operation, particularly the maintenance required. This can be a big turn-off for the average person that just wants a simple garden. Was ""keeping it simple"" part of what drove the design?"
aquaponics,3a7upf,neptronix,3,Wed Jun 17 23:22:11 2015 UTC,When we originally started this project we didn't realize how fragile a system like this was.   We bumped into the complications of getting things to grow ourselves after the first phase of development. The only things we had luck with were dandelions and mint. Both of which are incredibly hard to kill.   We consulted an biology alumni from PSU who studied aquaponics extensively to get us pointed in the right direction. (She is the current CEO of mobius)   After that we decided to automate the whole system and make the use of the system more practical for an everyday person. Really the only interactions we wanted people to have was harvesting the microgreens. If something went wrong we wanted to be sure that people could get the help they needed to fix the system and get things growing again. So we have implemented maintenance strategies to make the whole thing a bit less 'greek' to a beginner.   I guess to directly answer your question: Yep.  We developed the system so that anyone can use it mostly through the challenges we faced in the early stages of trying to develop our own unit.

aquaponics,3a8osw,julillama,3,Thu Jun 18 02:44:14 2015 UTC,A week or so ago I posted part of Penn State University's pest management docs.  The section on aphids might help you - http://extension.psu.edu/pests/ipm/agriculture/greenhouse/greenhouse-manual/sucking-pests  One problem with going the IPM route is that you can't use pesticides at the same time but that's not really a problem if you have decided you don't want to use them anyway.
aquaponics,3a8osw,zynix,2,Thu Jun 18 12:00:15 2015 UTC,"Ladybugs are lazy predators, IMO. Their larva stick around and eat a little, but it's difficult to use them to get a handle on an existing problem. As far as natural predators go, by far the best insect I've ever used has been Aphidoletes aphidimyza (predatory midge). It's a superb tracker, and it specifically targets large colonies of aphids in nature. They're such efficient killers that the once the larva have eaten, they literally continue killing aphids for entertainment. One larva typically kills 50 aphids per day.  If you want something spray-like, I've heard great things about the product Mycotrol-O, which is an organic fungal spore pesticide. It innoculates the leaves with Beauveria bassiana spores, which kill apids, whitefly, thrips, and mealyworms in 7-10 days. I've just experimenting with it myself.  In fact, if you live in the Illinois area, you're welcome to come over and try some out. A pint cost $80, but makes like 100 gallons of insecticide, so I've got more than I'll ever need."

Then spraying the plants with neem oil insecticide. Flooding the deep media bed to chase out the ants. Then using diatomous earth around the system base to prevent the ants from returning. Then putting the plants back in the system. I had aphids try to infect my deep media system and my zipgrow towers  this feburary. The key is to get rid of the ants that are farming the aphids.
aquaponics,3a89oh,Caseycrowe,3,Thu Jun 18 00:30:51 2015 UTC,"You probably have a lot of calcium carbonate buffering your system. You may have limestone in your substrate, or really hard water. Identify if your substrate has any major sources of alkalinity.  You can add a bit of acid to push things along, but be gentle with it. Most people new to aquatic chemistry will just keep adding acid until they get the pH they want, then measure it the next day and wonder why it's back up to 8.0. So they keep adding more and more acid. What they're really doing is burning off their carbonate buffer down to zero. Without any carbonate buffer, your pH can swing a factor of 10 overnight, killing all your poor fishies. Get a dkH test kit to keep an eye on your carbonate hardness. You want it always above a 4.

But there are MANY serious aquaponic growers and RAS professionals... and academics like Dr  Rococy, Savidov, Lennard, Timmons, Ebling, Losordo etc... that will advocate the use of ""hydroxide"" compounds to buffer pH up  And the rationale is based upon decades of aquaculture research and decades old knowledge of related water chemistries...

If you a have any anaerobic spots, denitrification will occur and alkalinity will also be restored.   Get a carboate alkalinity test kit and test your municipal water source.   I have read a lot about pH not lowering fast enough in many hobbyist systems.This doesn not happen in intensive systems because of higher feeding loads and nitrification."
aquaponics,3a89oh,Optimoprimo,2,Thu Jun 18 11:32:59 2015 UTC,"This is a 1x a week, maybe only 2x a month test -   http://www.apifishcare.com/product.php?p=downloads&id=587  You're using municipal, what is the KH & pH for that?   Also what are you doing to eliminate chlorine/chloramine from the municipal water?  Last bit, if you have some of your media that hasn't been exposed to water, can you throw it into a glass filled with white vinegar and see how much it bubbles?  ( curious if it has a lot of calcium locked into it ).  edit:  KH/ carbonate hardness.   pH is a measure of ionized hydrogen in water vs hydroxide.  For pH neutral both hydronium and hydroxide are 1:1.  If you have a high KH or even a measurable amount of KH, that means that calcium is suspend in your water and neutralizing the hydronium/ionized hydrogen keeping your water basic.  It catches most people off guard as they'll throw various types of acid into the water but the pH still remains high.  Then one day ( or even hour ) the last of the calcium is burned up and pH crashes.  If you're municipal has a high KH or your media is leaching carbonates, it will be a bit problematic.  From personal experience, when the pH is up above 8.0, most of the nitrogen becomes sequestered away and the ammonia becomes somewhat more toxic to fish.  In my head I have a analogy like a high pH system behaving similar to a combustion engine in the winter, very sluggish and takes a while to warm up.  Ideally it will burn off the excess KH.  Last question, what setup is your system configured like? (CHOP, CHIFT, bed over tank, etc )."

I see it says it is good for gardeners, so I'm sure it's fine. Just a general caveat.   I really think your shale is fine. Do the vinegar test; some people claim it's not the media itself, but sometimes there is a ""dust"" that coats the media which can contain limestone.. idk it seems like voodoo to me but can't hurt to be sure."

Nutrient lockout isn't just binding to the media.  One compound I know fairly well is ammonia.  As the pH shifts upward, it becomes ammonium ( positive charged ) which acts similar to carbon monoxide with fish.  Furthermore I believe that ammonium readily binds to nitrate and carbonate which is one facet of nutrient lockout.  This all said, a pH of 7 should not cause lockout and you're doing moderately well to have it hang around at 7.   Given the information provided, only advice is to move slowly and check if you have micronutrient issues ( magnesium, potassium, phosphate ).  Unrelated, to avoid future problems: shade your fish tank, and add something like this ( http://www.ecofilms.com.au/diy-radial-flow-filter-for-aquaponics/ ) between your fish tank and your system."

You've also completely missed out on a major aspect of the original description, namely that it described a cycle. You've described one part of the cycle; under your definition, buying fish waste, using nitrifying bacteria to convert it to plant food, and then selling that as fertilizer would be ""aquaponics"", when it most definitely isn't.

It actually worked out really well, kept the lettuce cool enough last year, and is great for starting seeds in cups of Hydroton. The other NFT gutters are true NFT. I tried some zipgrow towers last year, I didn't like them. I have NFT and media beds, no DWC either."

Check this thread for what I and others have dealt with: http://www.reddit.com/r/aquaponics/comments/2yn0di/psa_do_not_use_growstones/  Even if you wash them thoroughly they will still slowly leach calcium carbonate. This would not be a problem in a hydroponic setup where you can just nuke the buffer with some acid and build it back up again. Do that in AP and your fish die.   If you hang on to them, plan on running a hydro setup with no fish for at least a few months until you can get things stabilized."

Especially if you have enough fish in the system relative to the amount of growstone to drive the pH down.  It could just take you a year or so.  I'm at 1.5 years and now my pH barely rises, but I went through a lot to get there, and it's still a problem.  If I build a new system I will not use it."

Why did you decide against bell siphons?  Do you have any siphon issues?  When your beds are plumbed the way they are, do you get a lowered pipe pressure on the farthest media bed?"
aquaponics,39urhj,MyPartyUsername,3,Mon Jun 15 01:46:45 2015 UTC,"All great questions. Most seem to agree that a 1 pound fish to 10 gallon of water ratio is ample, and I'm not close to that yet, but as they get bigger I will relocate some of them to keep the ratio in tact. Actually those are bell siphons, they just have a breather tube on them, they seem to function much better that way. The key to maintaining equal pipe pressure is to have more pump than you need and to have the individual taps controlled by valves. The pump will want to push more water through the first tap so I restrict the flow with the valve, same with the second. In the end all the taps flow the same."
aquaponics,39urhj,MilkCurds,1 point,Mon Jun 15 02:48:05 2015 UTC,Just to help you establish yourself better... you might want to have a stronger platform for crowd funding... there are ample amounts of people who have a vast knowledge of the ins and outs of aquaponics. What makes you different from everyone else?   Also there appears to be no links to any info about what you're trying to do. Who are you? Do you have teaching/science credentials?
aquaponics,39urhj,MilkCurds,3,Mon Jun 15 01:57:07 2015 UTC,"I guess the big difference is that instead of turning it into a commercial venture, or trying to profit from it I want to use this as a tool to teach with and also as a means to supply free produce to my community. All this with the hope that 1000 other projects just like this pop up all over the world. I am a certified teacher, and I mainly teach adults. I see people struggle everyday and I try to give back to my community as much as I can. This would give me an opportunity to combine the two things I love most,teaching and helping others.  In terms of credentials..... I grew up on a farm where we always grew our own food. Livestock, including chickens, both meat and laying, dairy goats, pigs, milking cows, beef animals, and ducks. We also had huge gardens, fruit trees and berry bushes. We were self sustainable out of necessity 30+ years ago and I think that heading back that way is the right move. I took some environmental science in school, and for a summer worked doing ecosystem classification. This consisted of taking soil samples (ex. their type, what grows there, ph ) aging and identifying tree species. But honestly my degrees are in Spanish,Anthropology, and Education and all I want to do is share ideas, learn new things, and help people. This project is more about teaching and helping people vs how to be commercially viable as I have no intention of running this as anything other than non-profit."

Salts are created when you combine an acid with a base, Magnesium is alkaline while I believe sulfate is acidic.  Sodium chloride aka ""Salt"" on the other hand will cause problems as the sodium builds up until it chokes/starves plants to death because they can no longer absorb nutrients.  Chloride meanwhile, I believe but maybe wrong, is partially absorbed by plants and partially by fish."

aquaponics,39ed13,Terra_Ursidae,2,Thu Jun 11 16:40:59 2015 UTC,We do. That's why we use a dual root zone planting method. We can add any supplement we need to to the water for the upper half of the root zone and water it in. Unless we over water there is no risk to the fish no matter what you use. What we use as amendment depends on what the plant needs at a time. We make a good soil mix to start with tho which helps alot.   We do. Before we plant we take the pot and water it and determine how much water in OZs it takes before water comes out the bottom. Then we cut that amount in half and use that for water in the future. We use the same size pots so they are all the same. This way we can independently control the soil layer from the lower half of the roots which works like a normal media bed would. The water also helps push fresh air through the soil layer giving better gas exchange to that zone as well.

aquaponics,39ed13,ipper,1 point,Thu Jun 11 15:48:49 2015 UTC,Perhaps this is a foolish question but why is the shrimp tank separate from the fish? Predation? Different feed requirements? Have you thought about raising bi valves as well?
aquaponics,39ed13,mydogwalter,3,Thu Jun 11 22:39:57 2015 UTC,The shrimp are kept seperate to keep the large shrimp from eating baby tilapia and from the larger tilapia from eating the shrimp. It also makes its WAY easyer to make sure the shrimp are feed vs hoping some got past the fish. As far as requirements they do require we maintain calcium and KH levels and make sure our pH never goes below 6.8 but we have a automated pH system that handles all of that than I can't tell any of you about just yet so those are never an issue for me but would be for some one whos  is trying this. Keep your kh no lower than 3 or 4 and make sure you always have calcium in the system of some kind like oyster shells or some other slow release calcium with the shrimp for them to eat if needed. They die the most during molting or just before or after so helping them with that by allowing constant calcium sources is a big help for them and there shells.   Bivalves are ok but they have a big impact on teh system. First off fresh water mussels have a parasitic life stage when they live on fish and fish gills like a leech. That is not good for your fish but rarely fatal. Clams are ok but they have some issues as well. If you have ALOT of them like enough to keep algae down they will STRIP your calcium and KH out of the water almost as fast as you can supplement it. So its cool to have a handful of freshwater clams but as far as any practical application there is very little for those reasons. There also are a few parasites that humans can get that start in bivavles if memory serves me right which would be another reason to consider against it.

Even if there was some nutrient outflow, it still seems like less of an impact than other commercial protein sources. I would be interested in how it impacts biosecurity though, one one hand water is not being recycled so build up of pathogens might not be as much of an issue as in a closed loop, on the other unless they are putting serious work into treating the influent environmental pathogens/ harmful bacteria would have to be  introduced (?). Might be more energy efficient if it is gravity supplied as well."

aquaponics,391m1n,olsmobile,4,Mon Jun 8 16:18:47 2015 UTC,"This is a constant flood system. I used the output from my canister filter to flood a window box liner with water.  There are two draining pipes that plumb the water back into the tank once it reaches a certain level.  As a precaution I added a bulk head just above the water line with an output hose the same size as the one leaving the filter, so if one of the pipes clogs there is a way for the water to escape before over flowing.  As of right now I only have a few small house plants for now but the goal is to have enough plats so I won't have to worry about nitrates in my tank and dramatically lower the amount of water changes I need to do.  The sponge that you can see sticking out of one of the pipes is my way silencing the noise of air getting drawn through the pipes.  It also allows my to easily adjust the water level by raising and lowering the position of the sponge within the pipe.  If anyone has any suggestions of low light houseplants plants that could thrive with their roots constantly submerged I would love to hear them."

aquaponics,390fe9,FMF_Nate,1 point,Mon Jun 8 10:18:47 2015 UTC,"Tank self-cleaning by fish is achieved only over certain densities, which is usually higher than what people use in IBC totes. You still need some water movement so the fish keep swimming against the current in the desired direction so they keep resuspending the solids in the direction you want. Stangant water with free swimming fish will just make solids go everywhere.   What is a SLO?"

aquaponics,390fe9,ragamufin,1 point,Mon Jun 8 11:44:07 2015 UTC,"Got it. It's funny how AP people and aquaculture engineers end up naming the same things differently.   Welp the SLO will only cover a part of the tank bottom, you need water movement (in the form of impulse or in the form of fish swimming or both) to move the solids towards the SLO.   It all depends on how much fish youz have. Very few fish will not move solids, but solids production is low. Having more fish will start getting you into trouble, requiring a solution. Having a tank full of fish keeps it cleanest.   As I said, if you have no water movement, fish will push the solids in every direction, some towards the SLO, some away from it."

Try running your system with the well water and test samples from the system and one direct from the well. That way you can see if your system is eliminating that particular pathogen. My guess the contaminated water would be cleaned by your system."
aquaponics,38g0l2,uliarliarpantsonfire,4,Thu Jun 4 15:37:52 2015 UTC,Someone else might have better info but I would think that you would need to determine what is actually causing the diarrhea before deeming it safe for animals. I think you should get it tested. I have read that the local health dept. may do it for free. Here's a link to the EPA site with more info. http://water.epa.gov/drink/info/well/faq.cfm
aquaponics,38g0l2,Slimjeezy,2,Wed Jun 3 23:52:02 2015 UTC,"Aquaponics is heavilly dependant on bacteria, and in the past few years there has been a paradigm shift in how we think of bacterial populations, the philosophy of which I will try to explain here.   Spawned by the introduction of fast and cheap genetic sequencing, the past ten years have been huge huge huge regarding our understanding of the bacteria world, or microbiome.   For starters in the past we could only determine unique species of bacteria if they were able to be cultured on petri dishes. As it turns out, the overwhelming majority of bacteria can't be cultured on traditional plates.   When people say E. coli or Salmonella, know that there are millions upon millions of sub ""species"" of each. Its akin to classifying all animals as being horses or whatever.   When you say this well water has caused diariah, that dosn't necessarily mean there is inheriantly bad bacteria that will mess with your system. It means the population of bacteria inhabiting the well is sufficiently different from your own gut bacteria to cause an all out war between the two populations and long story short, cause your body to reject it.  I'm sure you've heard of Montezuma's revenge, where US travelers to Mexico suffer severe diareah after drinking their water. Mexico does not have the same water standards as the US (water here is essentially sterile) while water in Mexico has an abundant population of all different types, the specificity of which varies from source to source. The reason the locals don't get sick is because they were born and bred with that population, it is literally part of them. Its not bad, just different.  How does that relate to aquaponics? Just like your gut, a microbiome will be establised within your growing beds. The type of substrate you use, typese of plants, water sources, you stick your finger in it one day, these will all have an affect. What you want is a relatively stable and beneficial population, which is easy to obtain. Just like how life has balanced itself out for billions and billions of years, so will your system.   Thats what people mean when they talk about the 3 month or whatever cycleing needed to establish an aquaponic system. Its all about establishing a vast population of bacterial species working together to replicate the nirogen cycle, which I will not go into here.   If you use the well/spring water (which you absolutely, undoubtedly should) FUCK THAT! You already have one! Its all there baby! Plug and chug!   The equalization you need will come from when you introduce plants and fish and/or other amonia producing organism. If you want to get scientific about it and know exactly whats going on, all the interactions between each type etc etc, too fucking bad. Nobody knows or will know for a very long time. It takes an artists touch, but just like an artist you have to know the concepts in order to manipulate them and use them to your advantage.  That being said, I've been typing too long and have to go on a bikeride. If you have any questions or need clarification, don't hesitate to ask.   EDIT: Mineral content is in a totally different realm. The microbiome will adapt to it, but the plants might not."

aquaponics,38g0l2,MarsColonist,1 point,Thu Jun 4 00:09:42 2015 UTC,It's probably ok for the fish but it might be getting contaminated by cattle or even people. A shallow well will gather run off and seepage from the surrounding area which is most likely where your diarrhea inducing bacteria are coming from. You'd have to be very careful to wash everything thoroughly. If have lots of money laying around (hah) you could also try a UV filter.
aquaponics,38g0l2,pooppate,1 point,Thu Jun 4 14:00:39 2015 UTC,"I was thinking about something along those lines, but it involved a fresnel lens and a coil of copper to distill it.

aquaponics,38dj5l,I_Dont_Get_Your_Joke,1 point,Wed Jun 3 23:28:08 2015 UTC,"Had an AP system 2 years ago with turtles. Read a couple scientific papers that i dont have links to at the moment that say the fibers in most plants are too tightly woven to allow rod shaped bacteria such as salmonella to pass through. Makes sense because Im sure salmonella would kill the fuck out of a plant otherwise. As long as the amphibians dont have access to rub themselves on the exterior of the plants, like this setup, it should be ok. What I read made me confident enough to try it out and no one got sick. Now, that being said its important to note that it can still survive awhile resting on the exterior surfaces of a plant and this will very well happen because water will splatter all over the plants in the system constantly as it bounces off the grow media. Salmonella washes off pretty easily and you will need to do this before eating anything in the system (which you should do anyway).  If you really like frogs, knock yourself out.

aquaponics,38cypx,Optimoprimo,2,Wed Jun 3 15:45:25 2015 UTC,"Iron is often the major and only deficiency, but you can run into balance issues. It depends on where you get your water. If you're using municipal water in the U.S., often you can find the general chemistries of that water posted somewhere - whether by website or by calling your local waterworks. For example I use my cities tapwater and don't supplement a thing - all the calcium, magnesium, carbonate, zinc, etc. I would ever need is all in there. I add a little ascorbic acid to remove the chloramine and voila - nutrient rich water. All it needs is iron and nitrate.  If you're using rainwater or RO water, or just don't have very hard municipal water, then there are many deficiencies you'll need to watch. Ideally all your nutrients besides iron will be provided to the plants through fish waste, however unbalanced situations can occur where the plants use certain nutrients faster than your fish waste is produced or mineralized. I'd say besides iron it seems magnesium runs out in many systems. It's in fish waste but plants use it faster than it's produced. You can add Epsom salt to add magnesium. It's also important to make sure all your fish waste is being mineralized as efficiently as possible. I recommend reading the FAO Report from the sidebar, all the goodies about this are in there."

At 80F and daily feedings I can feed a growing cannabis all the nitrates it wants. Dropping the temp to ~68f (basement) and feeding once a week causes the nitrates to plummet. Very handy for the varied requirements of vegetating vs flowering cannabis

Building a form and moving these is more labor intensive, but ultimately cheaper, especially if you plan on building a lot of them.  Lightweight concrete uses perlite and sand as aggregate, and is not terribly strong. Using nylon or fiberglass reinforcement is quite helpful.   Once you build your form (and wax it), if you do not like the rough ""hypertufa"" look, you can mix cement, sand, colorant, and latex in a smaller amount and spray this on the form with a texture sprayer, before adding the concrete mix.  Texture can be added to the form, if desired. I use concrete board to add a wood texture.  These things should be sealed inside with a pond safe epoxy, or suitable (cheaper) rubber coating. Amazon is your friend here.  They do work without this coating, however. It does affect the ph at first, but balances out after awhile.  If you can move heavy objects you can purchase concrete water troughs that work brilliantly. In my area a 3'x8' water trough 11"" deep, costs about $180, But weights around 1,800 Lbs.

Only tip I can think of is where you get your water from is going to determine what kind of nutrient or chemistry issues you will need to deal with. Tap water is fine but must be dechlorinated.

aquaponics,388fk0,Alacritous,2,Tue Jun 2 20:43:50 2015 UTC,To be completely honest this system didn't make it a whole year. But that was partly my fault. The wife and I moved a month or so after I built to live in a small apartment. So I left it in my in-laws backyard. After that it didn't get much maintenance. The tomato plant you see in the video actually grew to be about 4 feet tall and started getting a lot of tomatoes. But I think I planted it to late and the whole thing wilted before they ripened up.  EDIT: BUT! The water was left on and running with fish for about 2 years and the siphon kept going and the fish survived. I just never got around to planting anything else.
aquaponics,3889q0,Time_To_Rebuild,1 point,Tue Jun 2 15:40:51 2015 UTC,"It should work. You will just need a strong enough pump raise the water level fast enough to engage the siphon . also you will need a really big sump tank because some water will go into the grow bed before it goes back to the fish. If you don't want to, or can't have a sump, you may want to try doing a constant flood."
aquaponics,3889q0,micahglasser,1 point,Tue Jun 2 16:50:32 2015 UTC,I was thinking about a sump but wasnt sure if it was necessary.  The grow bed would be 25 cu ft or 187 gal total (minus volume displaced by media) and the fish tank will be 75 cu ft or 561 gal.  Do you think reducing the fish tank volume by less than 1 ft in height will be too dramatic for the fish?
aquaponics,3889q0,micahglasser,1 point,Tue Jun 2 18:31:03 2015 UTC,That's not too bad. I was thinking the grow bed was more volume than that. Should be OK. Just research the fish you use to make sure they aren't bothered by it.

aquaponics,387swq,TheThirdRider,1 point,Tue Jun 2 18:02:45 2015 UTC,"there is no manual that i have found on how much to add. I just started adding it until I got the results i was after. My first experience supplementing K, P, Ca, Mg came when i first tried growing AP cannabis. I killed that first plant, But I learned a bunch. Now i grow very respectable cannabis..   Anyway, learning about the needs of flowering and fruiting plants got me to start adding those nutrients to my outdoor system and I started seeing better tomatoes, strawberries, and peppers almost immediately.   Start small with your dosages and see how it affects things.   You wont kill anything by adding a cup of potassium + 1/2 cup phosphorus + 1/4 mag +1/4 calcium to a couple hundred gallons of water but you will add TrillionsBillions of molecules of nutrients which the plants will munch. Note Those chemicals will raise your pH, so be aware of that ( I tend to add when the ph is low anyway)  Sources of chems  Potassium: Soluable Potash  Calcium: Hydrated Lime  Phosphorus: Bone Meal  Magnesium: Magnesium Sulfate  I also add Chelated Iron to everything."

There's 120g/Mol epsom salts. So 120g of epsom salts will give you 1 Mol of mg in solution.  How many ppm of magnesium do you want in solution?   If you know that h20 is 18g/Mol andl you know how much water is in your system you can figure out how to get what you want. 1 Mol mg per 1 million moles of water. Likely you don't have 1 million moles of water in your system, so you're gonna have to do a little math to figure out exactly how much you want to get the proper ppm.  As for sulfates, this article does a good job explaining that   Edit: final point. I didn't see you list your ph which is disconcerting as checking that is basically your only job besides feeding fish.

Ppm is equivalent to mg/l and 200 gallons is 757 liters, so we need 757mg of epsom salt to get 1ppm of epsom salt. Epsom salt is 10% magnesium, so we multiply by 10 to get 7570mg (or 7.57 grams) of epsom salt for 1ppm of magnesium.  7.57 grams of epsom salt in a 200 gallon system = 1ppm of magnesium.  113.55 grams (or pretty close to 4 ounces) of epsom salt in a 200 gallon system = 15ppm of magnesium  Hope that helps!"

aquaponics,382zqf,MysticLordOrlouge,10,Mon Jun 1 14:08:50 2015 UTC,"Crayfish are great bottom feeders and do well in AP. Also edible. They will attack slower fish but should leave Tilapia alone. They prefer a bottom a substrate that they can pick through, however. In micro systems this can be achieved with gravel, but it's not realistic with your usual outdoor system.  If you're talking about clams and mussels, they can be tricky because they prefer a high pH to sustain shell integrity and grow. The pH of most AP systems would actually slowly dissolve most bivalve shells. Also they need an adequate supply of calcium carbonate in the water which needs to be supplemented if your water is soft."
aquaponics,382zqf,Optimoprimo,2,Mon Jun 1 14:30:29 2015 UTC,"Would chunks of limestone serve as a calcium carbonate source?  I wouldn't actually eat the shellfish, I'd want them to filter out heavy metals and other toxins."
aquaponics,382zqf,Optimoprimo,8,Mon Jun 1 14:38:39 2015 UTC,"Yes limestone would, but you wouldn't want to do that since it also buffers pH to above 8. Most plants don't like a high pH and it also locks out a lot of your iron. It defeats the purpose of the system in the first place.  Also there's a big misconception about how bivalves work towards filtering out contaminants. They absorb it into their tissues just like any other animal, it's just that they comb through a lot of water over a day and there's a lot of them, allowing more contaminants to enter their bodies than the surrounding animals. It only works on an enormous scale like a lake or an ocean basin. Also the word ""filter"" is often misunderstood: the water doesn't come out of a mussel ""clean,"" it's just been removed of edible food. Like a baleen whale. Dissolved contaminants like methyl mercury can pass right through. If you have heavy metals in your system at all, mussels won't help with that. Your fish and plants will still be contaminated. You get around contaminants in your system by using nothing but food safe supplies."

I drilled holes in the bottom for the standpipe, used electrical PVC fittings with some rubber gaskets and 3/4"" PVC tubing and it works great, no leaks even without glue, would be better with. I use hydroton, and I've got it set to keep about the top 1"" dry. So far I've got green onions, squash, black beans, mint, basil, thyme, and cantaloupe growing in 4 beds made out of these and they are working great.    Is it possible for you to go into detail about your setup ?"

The hydroton fills the larger void spaces of the lava rock, makes the bed easier to dig through than lava rock alone, and the hydroton does get smashed to pieces like I initially worried it would.

aquaponics,37uc61,Apicalmeristem,3,Sun May 31 02:00:37 2015 UTC,"I would recommend lacewing larvae. They are awesome predators and since it is outdoor, there is the risk of lady bugs and mature lacewings flying away. There is the added benefit that they will likely eat any other soft-bodied pests that might be attracted to the aphid honeydew.  Depending on the size of your set-up, you may only have to release once, but I would recommend at least 2 releases to make sure you get most of them. Also, if aphids are a frequent problem in your area, you may want to release every few weeks to prevent the infestation."

aquaponics,37uc61,Hjalmark,2,Sat May 30 14:35:48 2015 UTC,"Yeah, winged aphids are a pain (they start reproducing with wings during shifts in temperature).  I really don't like ladybugs or lacewings for aphid control. I've used both of them and they're fine for general maintenance, but they're not going to tackle a larger problem. The best predatory insect I've ever used for aphids was aphidoletes aphidimyza (predatory midge). They're amazing trackers and are only found around large aphid colonies. Their larva consume something like 30 aphids a day, if I'm remembering that correctly.  Other treatments include neem oil (careful about getting that in your fish water though), compost tea made from vermicompost, and a home remedy I've never used that involves garlic.  Currently, I'm going to be playing around with the product Mycotrol-O for aphid control. It's a slurry of fungal spores that supposed to do wonders when dealing with aphids, whitefly, thrips, etc. If you're in the Illinois area, you're welcome to come over and try some out!

I am therefore also assuming that you're not worried about selling the fish for extra revenue.  Go for something hardy, tolerant, cheap and easily replacable, like goldfish for your fish.  I'd probably setup a media bed system to minimise space given over to stuff other than growing space. Plus media beds can help you support your plants rather than DWC or NFT where you'd need substantial support structures for your plants once they get large (and the buds get heavy).  You're going to need a decent amount of grow lights, power generation and ventilation (much like any other grow op) which you'd need to sort out.  IBCs would be a good starting point for your fish tank and grow beds.  Other details you can probably iron out pretty easily."

I've read that you have to add quite a bit of soluable potash, calcium, iron, and a few other micronutrients to effectively grow cannabis aquaponically.

aquaponics,37uwnf,celinameow,1 point,Sat May 30 17:33:20 2015 UTC,When using a wicking method only the bottom of the substrate is touching the water and the substrate wicks the water up to reach the root systems of the plants. Look up wicking beds for more info.  The roots will be fine submerged in water. I'm assuming you already have an aerator in your fish tank that should be enough for the plants as well. Just remember when adding more fish they will use more oxygen.   I've only worked with larger aquaponics systems so I'm not sure if it applies to a micro scale but I would also add some kind of filtration system between the fish and plants.

A friend and I discussed this option and we figured if you were to cut them up and stack a bunch of them, then submerge and having water flowing horizontally from one end to the other, it would probably be alright. Seeing as you have used it screen filter before, you probably know how dirty it can get. Do you think it would degrade eventually as compared to typical plastic media?"
aquaponics,37tr2w,ronnoc279,2,Sat May 30 09:39:54 2015 UTC,I think you could count on these things lasting 600 years like any other plastic.  It's basically recycled coke bottle plastic spun into fibers.

The concern with anything recycled is that you can't be sure of what was in the container before it was recycled, and how much of that ended up in the final product, and further how much of that will leach out and end up in your fish/plants.  The safest option is not to risk it, but it's really up to you.  It would be great if there were some real scientific analysis done on what and how much leaches out of recycled plastics."

I add the magnesium (epsom salts) whenever the leaves have a slight yellow to them. I alternate the calcium and potassium to raise the pH in my system when it dips under 6.5. The system runs around 6.8 to 7.2 pH most of the time now. Since I'm able to keep the pH in this range, I add maxicrop plus iron about every two weeks or so to supplement the iron.  The fish are fed aquamax 400 a couple times a day. The system is pretty low maintenance compared to the rest of the yard. It's been neat to compare the growth between all 3 systems this season so far.

With regards to the spider mites I didn't see any indicative damage http://www.organicgardeninfo.com/images/spider-mite-leaf-damage.jpg but they are small buggers that are hard to see.

I think you're correct with the leaf spot.  I think we've determined that we have Mg, Ca, and K deficiencies and also leaf spot.  All much more manageable (and less scary) than TMV."

The black is peat moss I'm using to reduce my hardness and pH as the system is only a couple months old. My guess is that my rosy red minnows are spawning and the eggs/fry are getting sucked up?

aquaponics,370ra8,squeakywipers,4,Sat May 23 20:05:54 2015 UTC,"The yellowing of plants may be due to iron deficiency. This can be corrected by adding chelated iron. In order to take in iron your water needs to be slightly acidic with ideal range of 6.4-7.4 for most types of chelated iron. Avoid buying EDDHA chelated iron, while it can be taken in by the plants at higher pH ranges, it changes the water to a red colour.  As for the system itself, I envy it. Actually I really envy your location too (I'm in Toronto where winters go to -40C and summers can go to +40C). My only concern would possibly be (and don't take this without more research/someone else confirming) your tomato plants not having enough root space at mature size. Just worried about it clogging up and preventing oxygen from reaching all the roots and causing 'root rot'.  I find it funny how your biggest investment is an auto feeder haha Good for weekends away but I would end up checking my system acouple times a day anyway and one of my favourite times is feeding time (mind you my system is indoors and the idea of anything leaking is pretty major).  Lastly, I would just like to add that British Columbia has really sparked interest with me in regards to aquaponics. California just doesn't seem to be getting less dry, space is more and more expensive there, culture is beginning to demand local, organic, eco-friendly produce.

Even then you should 'cap' the soil with gravel because if disturbed it will cloud the water like crazy.  Honestly, if you are at a hardware store just go check out the chelated iron ... it's fairly cheap and you won't have to add it every day.

aquaponics,36z5iw,GarbageTheClown,2,Sat May 23 10:29:05 2015 UTC,No need for a bucket or swirl filter on something that small. Anything small scale or low stocking density won't normally need a swril filter. They are more for commercial stocking densitys and raft systems. If your still overly worried just use a hang on the back aquarium filter with out the carbon in it instead for the scale your doing.
aquaponics,36z5iw,PotentPonics,2,Sat May 23 15:01:12 2015 UTC,"185 gph may not end up being all that much once you pump it up 2 feet. Even though its rated for 2+ feet, the resistance lowers the flow rate as you get closer to the maximum head. Just something to look for.  With the RO water you're going to want to keep a constant eye on your carbonate hardness. Small systems like this can crash very quickly, and if you burn through your carbonate buffer, your pH could drop dramatically overnight. Something as simple as occasionally adding dechlorinated tap water with a high kH can maintain it.  My indoor grow bed is about 8 inches deep, I think for herbs 6 should be fine. If you decide you want to grow larger fruiting plants you may run into issues with that.  Other comments mention the water weight on the totes and the overkill with the micro swirl filter. If you really want some pre-filtration, you could have the flow run through a little canister full of mesh. That's what I have and it works great. Keeps solids out of my growbed."

aquaponics,36z5iw,MilkCurds,-1,Mon May 25 16:13:02 2015 UTC,I would have to disagree with the last part of your comment. Goldfish get upwards of a foot long. In the aquarium world 25 gallons is recommended per goldfish at mature sizes. I don't think aquaponics is much different... you can filter more ammonia if needed but there comes a point where the fish will have no room to swim freely. Unless you feel like getting rid of the fish as they get bigger I would not recommend this at all.  Edit: I almost forgot to offer an alternative... I have a 40g aquarium and use rosy red minnows. They are just as hardy as goldfish and are cheap (feeders aswell).
aquaponics,36z5iw,fatheroftwoboys,1 point,Sun May 24 19:57:03 2015 UTC,That's it though. Aquaponics is NOT the aquarium world. I am part of both worlds BTW. My tanks parameters are normal.

It's just my opinion based off of what information I have collected. You sure as hell can have your own. Please rub it in my face if those 10 fish live to full size and seem active.

How did you try introducing the nitrifying bacteria? It usually isn't necessary if you're willing to wait long enough.   pH should be alright for now, nitrifying bacteria prefer high 7/low 8.  Other than that, time and patience and the bacteria should show up."
aquaponics,36vxth,maxxell13,2,Fri May 22 16:28:08 2015 UTC,I agree with the other comment - why change out the water?   You're reseting the timer and starting all over. What kind of ammonia?   Pure ammonia or urea or urine?   I'd suggest stepping it up with the ammonia - with no fish I'd add more. Why no plants?   It's fishless cycling not plantless.   The plants will benefit from the watering.
aquaponics,36vxth,aquaponics_in_paradi,2,Fri May 22 17:25:45 2015 UTC,What temperature is the water? Cold water can take significantly longer to cycle (if at all below ~55F).  I agree with /u/maxxell13 You need to leave the system alone and avoid tampering with it at all until it stabilizes.
aquaponics,36vxth,Sycosys,2,Fri May 22 17:32:05 2015 UTC,"I didn't add bacteria to my system, so mine took longer anyway. It took my system a month or 2 to cycle properly (it was relatively cold as well). I don't know when you changed your water, but that probably set you back pretty far. Water changes are particularly bad during cycling. You are dumping out some of your bacteria, then replacing it with water that hasn't lost any of its anti-bacterial treatment.  I would guess that all you need is to relax and let things happen. Give it time, don't do water changes."
aquaponics,36vxth,loggic,2,Fri May 22 19:59:48 2015 UTC,Your issue is your ammonia is to high or you have chloramines in your water. You should have seen nitrites by now. Your ammonia should be no higher than a 4 max. Anything higher will kill bacteria on its own. Do a big water change and get that ammonia down to at least a 4 before doing anything else. The 5 nitrate is probably from your tap. Your GH in that range will have no negative effect on cycleing. Have you asked your water company if they are using chloramines? This would not off gas like chlorine would and will linger for awhile. This can prevent colonization of bacteria and is the most common cause of a system not cycling. Call them and ask.
aquaponics,36vxth,PotentPonics,3,Fri May 22 17:55:46 2015 UTC,Ammonia is not too high for fishless cycling. Most manuals recommend 5ppm for fishless cycling.  Example: http://theaquaponicsource.com/starting-your-aquaponics-system-using-fishless-cycling/
aquaponics,36vxth,maxxell13,2,Fri May 22 18:01:32 2015 UTC,I have always used 4 as my rule of thumb. I know an ammonia of an 8 certainly will.

You shouldn't dose your ammonia beyond 2-3ppm...  Anything beyond WILL inhibit the nitrification... and WILL result in huge nitrite spikes that take weeks to clear and convert to nitrates...

I've used aeriation in the DWC for quite some time, and just recently put some in the media bed too to see if it made a difference. The system is indoors, inside a 24-foot shipping container.   I think I've tried introducing bacteria in this water for about 4 weeks. I figured too that the environment should be good for the nitrifying bacteria, but I've come across some info just now that they can be very sensitive to certain metals like copper. Maybe I should have this checked? I might need to wait longer, but I was expecting results earlier than this... I thought I would see atleast a little bit of conversion from ammonia to nitrite, but there's been none."
aquaponics,36vxth,PotentPonics,2,Fri May 22 17:35:19 2015 UTC,"You don't need aeration in the media bed, that's the point of the flood/drain cycle.   The timing of the flood drain is important. Sit there and time how long it takes to fill, and then how long it takes to drain."
aquaponics,36vxth,squeakywipers,1 point,Fri May 22 17:57:19 2015 UTC,Thanks. I'll remove the aerator from the media bed and start timing the flood/drain cycle. What would be the ideal cycle time? I could do some tweaking on the bell siphon and pump to adjust it.
aquaponics,36vxth,Aquaponics-Heretic,1 point,Fri May 22 21:34:50 2015 UTC,"Thanks for all the answers. The reason I did the water change was because i thought there might have been some contamination in the water which inhibited the bacterial growth. I won't do other water changes, as it seems all parameters should be just fine for the nitrifying bacteria. I will say I'm getting impatient though. /u/Sycosys: The temperature seems to be running stable at 24-25 degrees celcius, so well above 55-60F. It's constantly being heated by a 300W aquarium heater. I don't know if there's a significant temperature drop in the night, but I can start monitoring that once I have the arduino sending temperature information throught my rPi to the internet. /u/PotentPonics: from what I've gathered, I don't think the ammonia should be problematic at this level."
aquaponics,36tna4,burgundysaur,3,Fri May 22 00:54:11 2015 UTC,"you can get glass marbles, or acrylic balls cheaply, not exactly right, but they are both nearly impossible to see until algae grows..."
aquaponics,36tna4,richcreations,3,Fri May 22 02:08:41 2015 UTC,"Just spitballing here, but I'm thinking there might be some issues with negative phototropism in roots? Ie. roots growing away from the light. Might cause problems with some plants. Might not. Worth keeping in mind if you plan on keeping the roots exposed to light. I wouldn't be surprised if roots were more sensitive to UV light either.  Cool idea, though!  edit: some reading"
aquaponics,36tna4,potifar,2,Fri May 22 02:47:24 2015 UTC,So one approach might be to have a cover around the grow bed that could be temporarily lifted or removed while viewing.
aquaponics,36tna4,potifar,1 point,Fri May 22 13:21:22 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that sounds reasonable."
aquaponics,36tna4,Optimoprimo,2,Fri May 22 14:20:50 2015 UTC,"Problem 1: you are going to have a hard time maintaining nitrifying bacteria on anything with a smooth surface, such as plastic/glass balls. They'll support bacteria, but not great.  Problem 2: Zero refraction is mostly only in theory; there's too much imperfection that can cause refraction. At best you'll be able to ""kind of see"" where the roots are. Especially since everything will be covered in bacteria. Also buildup of solids in the growbed and algal growth will block your view over time. Even if you cover the growbed, algea finds a way.  I think your best bet for this idea would to set media in thin sections of clear material so you can easily see root growth from the sides, like the root viewer I had as a kid.. You could set up many rows of these things and split your flow among them. Have their drains all meet back up together and reenter your fish tank in one pipe. If you don't plan on eating any of these plants, maybe something like this stuff would help visibility."
aquaponics,36tna4,MrMalamat,2,Sat May 23 01:12:36 2015 UTC,I'm gonna go with algal growth. I've thought a transparent grow tower illuminated with LEDs would be pretty cool but unless you had a some kind of cover when not viewing algae would take over pretty quickly.

I have a small pump in the aquarium that feeds via flex-tube up into the media bed, and a bubbler in the aquarium.  I have a smallish CFL grow light above it.  I was never very successful getting the bell siphon to work, but I was able to quasi-successfully grow two heads of lettuce with continuous flow.  I don't think it's getting enough light, because the lettuce grew really tall, to the point that it was wrapping around the CFL and the leaves were burning.  I'm either going to get a second small light, or upgrade to a larger lamp overall.  I'm also going to go from a media bed to 3 or 4 NFT pipes, since I'm doing continuous flow anyway."
aquaponics,36fwop,csbingel,2,Tue May 19 12:20:08 2015 UTC,You need a min of at least 5 or 6 gallons to be able to stabilize the system chemically. When you go smaller than that stuff gets tricky because ph nitrate and others can change so fast if you make an error. This is why the little systems while cool don't always preform as well as big ones. Theres a min water volume that you need to keep the system stabilized.  I grow 4 heads of lettuce on a 2.5 gallon with 1 foot towers and it does just fine but i'm not sure it would grow tomatoes with out stripping your water of all nitrates. Basically you need enough water volume to house enough fish to not run out of nitrate which can be hard in really small systems.
aquaponics,36fwop,PotentPonics,1 point,Wed May 20 16:49:53 2015 UTC,I was considering researching some dwarf species of vegetables that are bred to have smaller root and plumage but produce relatively the same size of vegetable.

Nahhh.  Hopefully you'll take my word that I set the bell siphon on it high enough to where my system functioned fine without powered aeration and the circumstances of aerating a display aquarium are a bit different....

aquaponics,36fy1n,Optimoprimo,2,Tue May 19 03:26:51 2015 UTC,"A wind-powered pump and a decent supply that automatically gravity-delivers at the correct rate would be zero-power but still not require attendence. Although if it is not reliable/lack of wind causes supply to run out could cause trouble either way.  Actually, just the gravity feed would help a lot... Just a hose with a lot of resistance might sort-of-work, will go faster as water height increases though.  Edit: better to not make things too hard on yourself, starting off!

aquaponics,36fy1n,FMF_Nate,1 point,Wed May 20 09:27:43 2015 UTC,"I agree, and also disagree. Say you already gardened but wanted to check out this aquaponic craze sweeping the nation(may or may not be sweeping the nation). And say you also happen to have a koi pond or some other small water fixture with goldfish in your garden. You already likely go out once a day to water/check up on your garden. So you put some of these buckets above the pond and do exactly as he does in the video. If anything I would say absolutely use Hydroton and leave the lines a little higher in the bucket so theres a water reservoir and the hydroton should stay moist for longer than straight rocks/gravel. So if you do miss a day hopefully your plants don't die. Will it work for everyone? No, but if you really don't want to buy a small pump I could see it working. Actually you could get one of those cheap solar powered water fountains from harbor freight and just use that. You'd get only a little bit of flow, but probably enough to be hands free."

aquaponics,36cxoa,Caseycrowe,1 point,Mon May 18 22:15:10 2015 UTC,What are the pros of having a big bed vs  a bunch of little ones?
aquaponics,36cxoa,Caseycrowe,1 point,Wed May 20 02:36:57 2015 UTC,"The first is cost, lots of little beds get expensive, the uniseals, elbows, piping, materials all add up.  Second is flow, the two beds originally there had more water flowing into the beds to get the siphons to kick off, the one big bed doesn't need as much flow. So I don't need to put in a bigger pump to operate it.  Third is ease usable surface area. Thing like half barrels due the the curve in the bottom, you loose a lot of bacteria surface area, so you can't fit as much gravel in the same space. So my new bed could potentially handle 76 more fish (approx 500g harvest size, 25L filtration per fish).  And again price, the new is equal to 3 IBC's cut in half, cheapest I could find that's fish safe was approx $100 each, so that's $300 without any piping/uniseals. Mine was $250 without the media.  And last and most important to me is looks, IBC's and barrels look like crap (in my opinion, I'm sure others love them). I'm quite happy how my beds look  :D"

They are pleased you are uploading now. Let them enjoy the plants and stories about them. You started to talk about ph and your attempts to sort it out, we would much rather hear about that than Sony cameras. Editing would really help. Get a tripod, get a good shadow free shot list, maybe 30s to a minute of a list like this (multiple ones of each) : wide shot of the setup, close  view of a squash, close view of a leaf, the buckets, the fish, some pumps and a nice long sound clip we call the atmospheric (so the background sound doesn't jump about).

aquaponics,369cxn,PotentPonics,2,Sun May 17 22:21:19 2015 UTC,I haven't tried those plants yet.however I am looking into it. I would think the best way to do root crops is to actually put them in dirt and use the aquaponics water. I'm doing that with some potatoes now.
aquaponics,369cxn,Spitinthacoola,2,Mon May 18 01:19:18 2015 UTC,"Use a wicking bed heres a good video on it. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8i0n0QXbsw8  Basicly a cloth pot with your chosen soil mix. For potatoes its about the proper moisture and not getting them so wet they rot so with a wicking bed you put the bag down just deep enough into your grow media to touch the highest water level. Then you plant your potatoes about 1/2 - 1/3 of the way down where its damp but not to wet. Then watch them grow. I usually sprout my potatoes before planting but everyone has there own method. Carrots are the same way carrots onions will grow best with even exterior soil pressure which media does not provide so you get lump stuby ones when you don't use a wicking bed method. Between wicking beds, dual root zones, NFT, or rafts you can grow anything optimally you just need to match the appropriate method with the nutrient needs of your chosen plant type. The other big issue with some plants is pH. Alot of berries for example want a lower pH which can be done in an aquaponic system but you need to use fish, iron, and potassium that will work at a lower pH and would probably want to set a separate system up for it but I know it has been done. I'm currently working with cannabis, fruit trees, and medicinal herbs and you can grow anything in aquaponics as long as your make the roots happy. I ALWAYS have sugar beets growing they are a good bug magnet along with sugar snap peas to tell me if there are any bugs in my garden that I need to address before they become a problem."

aquaponics,369cxn,PotentPonics,1 point,Mon May 18 21:40:41 2015 UTC,Its still pulling resources from the system. If you are running a system solely on wicking beds make sure to leave a media layer in the bottom like a dual root zone would have so you can get enough exposed roots to pull the nitrates up fast enough to help the fish. Other wise you don't get a ton of nitrate export.

I'm sure you probably already know this but I'll say it anyway just incase... the goldfish will grow up to 12 inches if they reach adult age and will probably need to be rehomed. The output of your pump might also cause algae build up on the top of the media where it lands. Just trying to look out for you. Awesome system!
aquaponics,364wwt,MilkCurds,1 point,Mon May 18 19:41:51 2015 UTC,Thanks for the info. I had no idea that goldfish could get so big. I currently have 14 fish right now and the barrel is 35 gallons. Any idea how long it will take them to outgrow the space?
aquaponics,364wwt,MilkCurds,1 point,Tue May 19 02:04:54 2015 UTC,I would say after your system is cycled there shouldn't be much higher levels than 0.5 ppm of ammonia. The growth doesn't happen all at once so if you check your ammonia a couple times a month that will work. I'm not sure how fast this will happen. I use rosy red minnows for my 55 gallon system and can have upwards of 25 fish. The site 'aqadvisor' will give you a better idea of what you can keep in your system. Select user defined for your filter and set it to the size of your grow bed. This will give you stocking at adult sizes.

I ignored it anyway and chucked a couple tomato plants in anyway. Unfortunately this system will only run for a couple months longer at most then I have to  move back home so they won't really get a chance. I think I need to add some more plants because nitrates are off the wall high, I know that isn't a massive problem but 110ppm is pushing it a little. As plants grow and mature do their nutrient requirements increase significantly?"

Some fish will munch on algae when it is available, decreasing their overall appetite. If they aren't used to their surroundings, are eating algae, and/or aren't super fond of the food they are being given then it wouldn't be surprising for them not to eat much for the first few days.  EDIT: Double check your water conditions. If they are fine then let the fish be.  You say it is a ""new"" system. Had everything been well cycled before you added the fish? Adding a lot of fish all at once to a barely cycled system can overload the existing bacteria. The whole system then basically has to cycle again, but this process is much faster since there are significant existing colonies of the bacteria you need."

Once it sets, cut into cubes and freeze. Some fish like floating food, some like sinking food. The advice given in the instructable was to add lots of air to the gelatin if you want floating food (use an electric beater and get lots of bubbles). Otherwise the food block will sink slowly."

So im just gonna throw out an educated guess.   0 ammonia is bad for your plants, no wonder you have nutrient deficiencies, check out your phosphorus lvls too cause they might also be low. you need some sort of way to replenish the nitrogen, which would probably mean more fish to pee in the water. Its also weird your nitrite lvls are almost as high or higher than nitrate, your plants are taking up as much nitrate as they can and they dont have enough  im guessing cause you changed the water, added plants but no new aquatic life that your nitrogen cycle got completely messed up and you need to add more. it might have even been low before hand  as for the cloudy water, that is technically turbidity (basically cloudiness), or just organic matter floating around your tank, maybe you need another snail to decompose that further? idk."

aquaponics,35lyp9,NogginFloggin,3,Mon May 11 16:24:09 2015 UTC,"Egyptians have been doing that for years.   Google about desert aquaculture in Egypt.   I also built some small research system for the same purpose. Works awright. You have to have decent solids removal not to clog the drippers too fast. They will clog eventually due to bacterial growth, but that's easy to control.    Ideally, you want a biofilter to oxidise ammonia into nitrate and a digester so you can mineralise the fish sludge and use that water on your plants. You can exchange as much water as you want as long as your biofilter is mature. Dissolved ammonia oxidation is a very fast process. Retention times between 5 and 10 minutes are enough for 50-80% single pass removal of TAN on a biofilter.   Sludge digestion is another thing: 3 to 4 weeks, which means you need to concentrate your waste stream as much as possible so your digesters do not end up occupying too much space."
aquaponics,35lyp9,Pastelitomaracucho,1 point,Mon May 11 18:31:24 2015 UTC,Another problem that might arise is salt accumulation in the soil. Constant input of nutrient rich water could cause salt build up over time. The only realistic thing you can do to prevent this would be to leech the soils with pure water every couple years or so.

aquaponics,35lyp9,Sycosys,1 point,Tue May 12 13:52:30 2015 UTC,The problem i see with this is that with a constant inflow of fresh water you are never going to really establish a colony of nitrifying bacteria.   If your water turn over rate was fairly slow or if you had a metric shit ton of fish you might be able to pull it off.   The reason closed loops work so well is that wastes build up and are subsequently broken down into nutrients. With an open system you are removing that buildup of wastes (and the bacteria to deal with them) and would likely end up just pouring diluted ammonia/fish waste onto your plants.
aquaponics,35lyp9,ostreatus,1 point,Mon May 11 16:48:42 2015 UTC,I see. The waste water would be more of a supplement every few days rather than a constant flow. Maybe if I cycled through the tanks and did an 80% flush weekly per tank after the bacteria  colony is established or something like that?

aquaponics,35gktf,MilkCurds,2,Sun May 10 04:58:11 2015 UTC,"Well, I was using two tanks, where pump a from tank a goes into my growbed and drains into tank b.  Pump b circulates it back into tank a.  Because I used whatever I could scavenge to make my growbed, the rate at which pump a brings water into the growbed was faster then it could drain.  I fixed it by taking PVC and drilling holes with it, like a sprinkler.  Unfortunately, after that problem was fixed and the growbed drain fine, pump b was moving water too fast out of tank b, causing tank a to overflow.  So, I have to find a way to adjust strengths or turn it off.  And for the P.S.- there is no electricity on now.  When I get it up and running again I will definitely move it!  Thanks!"
aquaponics,35gktf,Gayrub,2,Sun May 10 05:04:47 2015 UTC,Why not skip the smaller tank all together?? Do you have multiple fish?  Also if you are looking for peace of mind .. I would grab a piece of plywood or a couple 2x4s and support the growbed so that the weight is pushing down on the tank and not outward on the wall.   Glad to see you have growth. Hopefully it gets bushy. What do you use for light?
aquaponics,35gktf,Gayrub,1 point,Sun May 10 11:28:43 2015 UTC,"I thought of this... it would probably help.  Tank a has some feeders and these fish that are extremely fast (couldn't translate the name) but tank B has bristlenose algae eaters. I think just setting it up as single tank would be best and using plywood for support would merit as well.  For light I just have indirect sunlight and a grow lamp designed for nightshades.

aquaponics,352dwn,Caseycrowe,2,Wed May 6 15:08:42 2015 UTC,"Salt doesn't interact with nitrites, it just soothes the gills of your fish and adds electrolytes to help them survive the toxic environment. Comet goldfish are warriors, you shouldn't worry. They will starve to death though. You can feed them. Adding a little more ammonia each day isn't going to trash the cycle."
aquaponics,352dwn,Optimoprimo,1 point,Wed May 6 21:26:35 2015 UTC,It does not sooth the gills. Chloride ions  compete  against nitrite at the cell membrane  in the gill.  The gill ends up selecting chloride which is constantly queueing to go into the gill and not allowing nitrite in.
aquaponics,352dwn,Pastelitomaracucho,2,Thu May 7 04:35:38 2015 UTC,"The process you described soothes the gills from nitrite. So I don't get why this needed clarification. It still isn't interacting with nitrite, which was the point."
aquaponics,352dwn,Optimoprimo,2,Thu May 7 12:47:56 2015 UTC,"I had a similar issue starting up my system. This was my first system, so I made the mistake of suddenly adding in a ton of fish once the system had apparently cycled.  I changed out a huge amount of water, damn near starved my fish, and my nitrites were still way too high. My last resort was taking out all my fish, putting them in a cooler full of fresh water, and letting the system just chew through all the nitrites that were still there. Once the nitrite levels got back to near 0, I started adding the fish back in to the system, 7 the first day, then 2 or 3 per day or two.  Changed ~80% of the water in the cooler 3 times daily just after feeding (no idea if this many was necessary, but after losing 4 fish to nitrites I wasn't taking chances), kept it salted for the first few days. The fish perked up a lot after being in the clean water, and I kept an eye on them as a added them back in.  This seemed to accomplish everything I was hoping for: fish perked up a lot/stopped dying and the system continued to cycle with the existing nitrites. Maybe I slowed things down, but just the fact that I was consistently doing something helped put my mind at ease."

Just keep an eye out in case you want to do a water exchange.  Your nitrates stopped going up because you are not feeding and your system is not producing ammonia.

aquaponics,34yref,Optimoprimo,1 point,Wed May 6 15:39:07 2015 UTC,"Right. The carbon is taken from the atmosphere. Plants fix it into tissues, which is then consumed by animals, which breathe the carbon back into the atmosphere. So in that sense your carbon source is as good as infinite. As is your energy source. You are removing nitrogen, phosphorous, iron, etc. And that needs to be replaced. No matter how sustainable and balanced you make your system, more will have to come from somewhere eventually.

You put your compost in a container with a ramp, the flies land and lay their eggs, the eggs hatch and eat, get large, then the maggots climb the ramp and fall into the container off the side. From there you feed them to the fish. You can also feed them to chickens and put chicken waste into your system, but that's hard and complex to do."

Coli. One thing you could do that I've tried a little bit and some other fold are doing is feeding the fish baby worms either from your growbed or from a separate worm farm (compost pile/box farm/etc.) but I think that's more of a treat, I'm not sure if your fish would thrive on that alone. You can also feed them some stuff from your garden as a supplement. For example, I have a really small scale system that I breed guppies in, and I'm growing peas for myself, but occasionally I will feed the fish a cooked pea to help with their digestion. As some people mentioned, duckweed is used a lot, but again, not sure if that is a good staple food to use since the fish need very high protein to grow and produce enough ammonia for your plants.   I know a lot of commercial fish food is made from fish, so maybe you could make your own from fish in your system? I'm just spit balling, though, you probably wouldn't want to feed the fish from their own species."

aquaponics,34yref,uselubewithcondoms,2,Wed May 6 16:40:56 2015 UTC,"I read an amazing book when I was younger of a system built in the 80s, where it was a greenhouse / aquaponics / rabbit farm combo. The fish tank was the greenhouses heat reservoir, the rabbits ate all the greenhouse scraps (plus some additional feed), the tilapia are the rabbits droppings (They eat decaying vegetable matter, which is exactly what rabbit droppings are made of) and the fish tank was used for both aquaponics and to irrigate crops grown in regular soil. When they cleaned out the fish tank, the bottom mud became potent fertilizer.  I see mentioned worries about feces having e-coli etc, but in a balanced system there isn't really a worry. E-coli is a sign of an unbalanced system or artificially balanced system (using antibiotics, growth hormones etc). When you're reproducing a natural system, it tends to have natural checks and balances.  I believe systems like this are used intensively in Asia and a home/system like this is my dream!"

aquaponics,34qb10,MrMalamat,9,Sun May 3 16:46:58 2015 UTC,"Do you have worms to mechanically break the stuff down? Since the temperature won't get above 100F to promote thermophilic bacteria, you'll be relying on mesophylic bacteria, which work a fair bit more slowly. You also want to make sure this area is getting a lot of aeration. If it ever stinks, it's bad news. Also expect your water to become much more tea colored than it used to be. Not a bad thing, but composting adds a ton of humic acids into the water. Which will add to the acidity, another thing we always combat in AP. Keep your carbonate up. Composting will help mineralize the more scarce essentials like iron, magnesium, and potassium."
aquaponics,34qb10,Optimoprimo,2,Sun May 3 16:57:24 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the response. I'll be adding worms in another week or two (10 wk old system) so I've been very conservative adding anything to the compost until then. My tap water comes from a limestone aquifer, so it's very hard. It is softened to an extent with lime but at the expense of having a pH 9 straight out of the tap. It's been a challenge getting it down (hovering around 7.4 now) but I was hoping this small compost would be helpful in that regard."

Both of those closer 55 drums need to be covered ASAP.   If you still have the lids ( if you ever had them, sometimes I know its just the barrel ), cut them up to cover the water.  Light into your FT or in almost any body of water in AP is a key ingredients for bacteria or algae/yeast to get a foot hold.  Neither will destroy an AP system but they will steal nitrates from you and mess with your D/O ( dissolved oxygen ).

aquaponics,34qjpb,Optimoprimo,2,Sun May 3 23:09:30 2015 UTC,"I didnt say there are turbidity issues that can't be solved by filtration. Yes you can filter anything out of water chemically or mechanically. That doesn't mean that you should, and it also in no way means your original problem was just a lack of filtration to begin with. Especially in AP. Biological imbalances that cause sudden bacterial growth in the water and a high flow rate in the fish tank are the classic reasons to cause the water to be turbid. An extreme case I had was a student over-buffered their water too abruptly and caused calcium to spontaneously precipitate causing a white cloud. I was seeking out those answers because potentially OP thinks he has filtration issues when actually he is experiencing something like a nitrite spike and bacterial bloom."

aquaponics,34npl9,garciaee,4,Mon May 4 16:19:32 2015 UTC,What is your opinion of climate battery / subterranean heating and cooling systems? Have you ever used a greenhouse with one?
aquaponics,34npl9,garciaee,2,Sun May 3 01:22:51 2015 UTC,"While I have never had one of my own, and therefore cannot speak to it directly, I can say I love the concept.  We will be exploring it for our next outdoor greenhouse."
aquaponics,34npl9,Ta1nted1,5,Mon May 4 16:25:47 2015 UTC,"If you could tell yourself one thing before you started Aquaponics, what would it be and why?"
aquaponics,34npl9,The_Masturbatrix,2,Sun May 3 03:39:09 2015 UTC,"Start small.  With the epicness of aquaponics, it is natural to think big and shoot for the moon.  This is a great mindset, however it is vital to grow intelligently and build naturally on each previous success and failure.  We grew our systems in size naturally, starting with a desktop(20 gallons), then a backyard system (400 gallons), then a community-scale system (3000+ gallons).  Luckily this has given us insight gained from experiences at all scales.  I strongly believe other Aquapioneers benefit from similar experiences.  All the failed aquaponics farms I've ever seen started too big and burned up their capital and good will too quickly.  It is a shame when that happens."
aquaponics,34npl9,The_Masturbatrix,3,Mon May 4 16:30:49 2015 UTC,"Great! I wanted to ask about transitioning to Aquaponics and therefore, I have many questions. Firstly, what kinds of fish do you recommend and discourage?"
aquaponics,34npl9,highflyer83,1 point,Sat May 2 21:22:25 2015 UTC,"Any fresh water fish works for aquaponics. We traditionally recommend people start with Koi, Tilapia, or Catfish. Tilapia are best for warmer waters (ideally 70 degrees F). In choosing a fish you need to determine your goals for the system. If you are looking for the fish to be a food source than you would choose an edible like catfish or tilapia. If you don't want to eat your fish and just use them as a fertilizer source something ornamental like koi is a good choice because they live for years.  Obviously no salt water fish unless you want to grow salt water plants.  I would also discourage against salmon because it is hard to raise in a contained environment. I've seen systems that use perch, bass and trout as well to good success. The only caveat being they take a bit longer to grow to plate size."
aquaponics,34npl9,garciaee,2,Sat May 2 21:30:37 2015 UTC,"Oh that's great. I guess based on this, it would be important to see the lifecycle for a determined fresh water fish. Where is a good place to get fish eggs or ""baby"" fish. How much should I expect to pay for each fish (for example Tilapia) and then the cost to raise to ""plate-size""?"
aquaponics,34npl9,garciaee,2,Sat May 2 21:35:15 2015 UTC,"Depends on what fish you go for. Generally you want to get fingerlings and then raise them yourself because its much more cost efficient than getting grown fish. If you're looking for a local supplier see if your state's university has an agriculture department they'll know the aquaculturists in your state.  We get our koi from blackwatercreek out of florida. http://www.koisale.com/ We get our tilapia out of a supplier in North Carolina  http://tilapiasource.com/ We've been happy with both, healthy fish every time. They are a good benchmark for pricing as well.   Generally your going to pay about .75-1.50 per fish depending on their size. They ship them in an oxygenated bag in a box overnight (about 80 bux usually for shipping and you have to overnight them).  When they arrive its important to acclimate them quickly but also taking into account that their journey was very rough. Our basic procedure is open the box and drop an air stone into the bag. Over the first hour we add some of our system water (about a half cup every ten minutes) to the bag. This acclimates them to our system water which will be much different than what they are used to. So it's important to do that gradually. After doing that for an hour we take the bag to the fish tank they will be going in. We tie the bag to the side of the tank and lower it gently into the water. This is going to start acclimating them to our systems temp as well in a gradual way. We also have an airstone in the bag still usually from the tank. We wait until the temps in the bag is the same as the temp in the tank. Then we transfer them by net from the bag to the tank. It is important not to just dump the bag and water into the system. The fish were stressed on their journey and the water they came in is not in a healthy state. But that's the basic process for adding fish to a system."
aquaponics,34npl9,garciaee,3,Sat May 2 22:00:47 2015 UTC,"Secondly, what types of plants (fruits and vegatables) do you recommend or discourage?"
aquaponics,34npl9,Aquaponics-Heretic,1 point,Sat May 2 21:22:55 2015 UTC,"Just about every plant that grows in the soil can be grown aquaponically. There a few extremeophiles like chrysanthemum (MUMs) that don't do well in aquaponics because of they tend to like a bit lower ph. Anything that can grow in a ph-6-8 generally does fine with aquaponics.  Spinach has been finicky for us as well although in theory it should do fine.  We've grown everything from the normal leafy greens and herbs to heriloom tomatoes, squash, bell peppers, jalapenos, thai peppers and habernero peppers, cucumbers, pole beans, hops, strawberries, cabbage, broccoli. The sky is really the limit with aquaponics. That being said different style systems are better for some plant types than others. These days for our commercial system we stick almost exclusively to lettuce, mint basil, parsley, sage and oregano. We landed there for multiple reason but essentially the margins are good, the labor is light and the transport from farm to market is pretty easy.  Leafy greens and herbs do well in any style system. For your fruits and vegetables generally you are going to want to do those in a media bed system. Raft and NFT (nutrient film technique) pose challenges for most fruits and vegetables.  I would highly encourage starting out with leafy greens and herbs. Especially if you have no prior experience growing. Also for you bigger fruits and vegetables (tomatoes, squash, melons) waiting a year before adding those to a system. It has been our experience (and others we know in the industry) that it takes a while for your system to be able to handle their significant nutrient demands.   Also i'm going to suggest everyone try strawberries. Pretty easy to grow and do well in most styles. Our town is somewhat known for its berries and i have to say i've never tasted anything like a strawberry straight out of an aquaponics system. So juicy!"
aquaponics,34npl9,Aquaponics-Heretic,3,Sat May 2 21:45:46 2015 UTC,Do you think rocket mass heaters are a  viable option for heating water during the cold months?
aquaponics,34npl9,Aquaponics-Heretic,2,Sat May 2 21:27:07 2015 UTC,"We use a number of techniques to grow in the cold months here in CT. We heat the water (and only the water) with an online heater originally used to heat a hot-tub.  That hot water keeps the roots warm and signals the plants that it is actually warm out.  Then the heat of the water escapes up into the lower canopy of the plants.  We trap this heat with mini-greenhouses, a la Eliot Coleman's Winter Harvest Handbook, placed over the plant beds.  This mimics the natural way the Earth regulates temperature.  The soil temperature is steady throughout the seasons, regardless of air fluctuating air temps.  The soil therefore is the reliable metric for the plant to follow.  Keep the roots warm and the plant is happy!"
aquaponics,34npl9,garciaee,4,Sat May 2 21:40:33 2015 UTC,Don't you run into problems with water oxygenation doing that? Over 70 degrees F water doesn't hold dissolved oxygen in it nearly as well.

aquaponics,34npl9,garciaee,2,Mon May 4 13:39:19 2015 UTC,"Ah, well then that explains it. Also, how do you keep your water from becoming a biotic soup of algae and other nastiness at those temps?"
aquaponics,34npl9,columnmn,2,Mon May 4 16:25:52 2015 UTC,"Our temps in the hot time of the year is not that bad at around 80 or so, maybe on the hottest streaks, up to 90F.  The bacteria of the system are well established and adapted to native climate swings to a certain extent."

The airstones sucked up all the smoke into the water making a poison soup.  Luckily the system pulled through and he is back up again and going strong!
aquaponics,34npl9,MrMalamat,3,Mon May 4 17:57:44 2015 UTC,"From my understanding and due to the nature of nutrition specific to any specie, it is important to pair the right fish with the right plant, correct? Do you provide a chart or a resource to view such pairings?"
aquaponics,34npl9,TheChonk,1 point,Sat May 2 21:27:09 2015 UTC,"Yes, it is true that certain plants go well together.  This is known as Companion Planting (and is important in soil AND soil-less growing.  We consider companion plants in all of our gardens.  We believe in creating a strong, robust ecosystem and the more plant types we add, the stronger that ecosystem becomes.  As for matching fish to plants, that is a place that is in dire need of some research.  Any fresh water fish will produce the ammonia necessary to run an aquaponics system.  I am unaware of specific differences between fish types on effects on the plants."
aquaponics,34npl9,TheChonk,3,Sat May 2 21:43:41 2015 UTC,Have you had better results Companion Planting one type over the other? Which have been most successful for you and which have been less successful? Which ones are currently pairing?
aquaponics,34npl9,denjin,4,Sat May 2 21:49:31 2015 UTC,"My favorite is Basil.  Basil goes with almost anything and releases a compound from its roots that encourages other plants around it to increase essential oil output.  That means stronger herbs, tastier tomatoes and a better smelling garden! Here's the guide we use: http://www.ghorganics.com/page2.html"
aquaponics,34npl9,garciaee,3,Sat May 2 21:53:26 2015 UTC,Wow. Great tip.
aquaponics,34npl9,garciaee,3,Sat May 2 21:59:19 2015 UTC,"Given the principle basis of companion planting (other than pest control)...  Is the suggestion that some plants feed/require more of some nutrients than others  And in an AP system we're recirculating, or supplementing all the nutrient requirements (generally).... doesn't that suggest that companion planting other than for possible beneficial bug attraction.. is essentially irrelevant?"
aquaponics,34npl9,garciaee,1 point,Sun May 3 11:29:04 2015 UTC,"Companion planting does effect nutrient requirements, yes.  Plants that naturally grow well together typically use complementary nutrient profiles to that of their native soils.  However, certain companion planting scenarios (like basil mentioned above) provide additional benefits to one another beyond simply complementing each other oh the nutrients they need."

The problem is Chloramines, which will not degas and will bond with water. These is the reason you have to treat the water.   There are various methods. You can buy an expensive r/o water filter that removes this and other minerals. The problem is that our systems need the other minerals.   The method I use is Safe by Seachem. I've heard many in this hobby/industry use it. Unless you're an organic aquaponic farmer, this is a chemical that you sadly need. It doesn't throw the PH like vitamin C."

Any idea what the main ingredient in this clor-amx is?
aquaponics,34gugs,PotentPonics,1 point,Sat May 2 03:30:02 2015 UTC,The problem is you cant use this solely long term because of the sodium.
aquaponics,34gugs,dornforprez,2,Sat May 2 17:30:26 2015 UTC,"The sodium content is so minimal as to be irrelevant.  This is a product that has been used for decades in aquaculture and hydroponics.  There is far more sodium in fish food, by orders of magnitude.  Almost all source water has at least some sodium in it.  Not to mention, most people add salt (sodium chloride) to their system at about .2-.5% for fish health, and it has been proven time and time again not to adversely impact plants at all.  Sodium content in ClorAm-X is a complete non-issue."
aquaponics,34gugs,columnmn,1 point,Thu May 7 20:03:03 2015 UTC,"It depends on the size of your system, from trial and error of many people, they can usually handle 10% tap water added directly. But if you've only got a small system, I wouldn't recommend it."

aquaponics,34gugs,PotentPonics,2,Fri May 1 16:48:37 2015 UTC,No. The reason it is nice is that it separates the chlorine and ammonia leaving the ammonia behind to be nitrified. Potassium theosulfate is used for agricultural dechloreinating for farm feilds. I get mine from a farm supply store near me but I'm a bit spoiled.  I do know some people have issue with potassium metabisulfate and its also antimicrobial but I have never heard of anything negative about theosulfate. I know its widely used in ag and in the aquarium world as well with sensitive invertebrates so I can't imagine there is an issue.

I'm imagining a flood and drain system with clay pellets?  I wonder if you could construct a flood and drain system away from the light for them?  You could then adjust the autosiphon and the water fill level for optimum conditions.  Apparently perlite is inert so that could be used as a grow medium.  I imagine they would continue to automatically repopulate.  Interesting idea!"

Inside the beds were clay pellets.  The water would pump from the aquarium into the beds at a constant flow rate, and there was lots of aeration.   I think they do fine without adding anything, as long as there are some dead roots in the system.  Now I imagine you don't have to clean out old roots, you just leave them there and let the mushrooms eat them up. The mycellium develop rather quickly, and seem to do well in the water."

Did you check to see if it was actually growing in the water when you pulled it out?  I also read that the clay pellets weren't ideal because the perlite offered more surface area.  If it grew so quickly for you imagine what would be possible with those improvements!"

I had hops in pots before moving them in the ground a few years ago and the freezes never got bad enough to kill them off in the pots. The hardest freeze we might have is 30s or  20s for 5-7 hours. Should I worry about bringing them into the garage for something like that or just throw a tarp over them?

When it appears on newly formed leaves it is symptomatic of an iron issue.  Try adding a small amount of epsom salt (magnesium sulfate) to the system or apply via a foliar spray.  In the case of iron deficiency, use chelated iron.  Having said that.  Iron deficiency has always been much more common in my systems than magnesium.  So it might be worth trying the chelated iron first if you are not sure which could be causing the issue."

If the feeding load is low enough, the biofilter is redundant. That biofilter should be able to process less than 30 grams of feed a day, if you want a number to work with. Big enough or small enough, depends on his feeding load.   At this sizes and with a radial flow upstream, probably fluidization doesnt matter too much. If anything we could use it as a bead filter, leaving the media static to it captures suspended solids and then backwashing the filter once a day or two. I do not know about  the density of those bucky balls, but they seem to be more for trickling operation rather than fluidised... if anyone has info on them I ca provide feedback."

Bubbles, flowing water noises and especially the noise of the stand pipe are all air/water mixing and are good things. I mean, if the noise is pissing you off or cause problems then I guess you have to fix it but having air sucked down a stand pipe seems like a good thing to me.  Regarding sizing of the radial flow filter, you want the dwell time to be between one and two minutes I think, but I don't remember where I read that. So your pump flow/min at that head gives you the minimum size of your RFF."

aquaponics,3480cx,MrMalamat,0,Wed Apr 29 04:37:17 2015 UTC,Dwell time is more correctly termed residence time. It's a function of the filters volume and the system's flow rate through the filter and is directly related to the density and critical settling velocity of the fish waste.
aquaponics,3480cx,Optimoprimo,0,Wed Apr 29 02:55:07 2015 UTC,"It's largely dependent on stocking density. That bucket is plenty, so long as it has good aeration and circulation and this user doesn't stock on the high end.

Aquaponic gardening allows for 90% less water use than conventional gardens. The water recirculates through the closed system significantly reducing waste. The nutrients for the plants come from the fish waste and the fish food can be grown in the system using common duckweed. Although initial cost of a system is much higher than a conventional garden, that may change in the near future as water resourceds deplete and the cost of water increases. When food and water costs rise, they will be met with this new technology redefining how we produce food which will eventually lead to lower food cost.  Proofread for you. :)"

aquaponics,342uib,jerry_03,2,Mon Apr 27 21:37:09 2015 UTC,"Well the first thing to understand is that with your design you will still have solids building up in your media bed. I get the idea of this, but depending on how you design it, you will not end up with a 50/50 split of solids into that filter. Majority of solids are going to end up where the flow rate is higher. You could have all the water pour into a prefilter, which then drains into the media bed. Regardless, I personally like filtering solids before the media bed because it reduces buildup. People add worms to their media beds to help breakdown solids, and usually the media bed keeps up. To me it's all just a mess and a pain in the ass and my plants don't NEED that much mineralization. I filter the solids, break them down elsewhere, then reintroduce the tea component of what's broken down. /u/sycosys has a little pond I believe. He may have more pond-specific answers.  Wetland taro sounds cool and is way over my head. I know it's grown in shallow water. You'll want only a moderate flow over them but you also don't want solids building up around them. It would probably be best to make a separate area for them, just so you have control over their environment."

aquaponics,342uib,goldenriverguide,1 point,Tue Apr 28 04:58:29 2015 UTC,"Here are a few things I could think of that you should consider:   Is it worth putting in a drain? Would It not be easier to use a regular submersible pond pump? If you need to empty the pond for any reason you can just direct the water flow out of the grow bed.  To answer your question about the need for filtration, yes, you will definitely need something to remove the solids. Remember it is primarily the  water soluble  ammonia fish excrete from their gills and not the 'poo' you want. Undesirable bacteria will flourish on solid fish waste, releasing toxins into the water.  As /u/Optimoprimo said, ideally you would filter all of the water flowing into the grow bed. Look up radial flow filters, and easy to construct and maintain alternative. Definitely plan on adding worms into your grow beds, and algae consuming fish into your pond. You will probably want something to cover the pond too, to limit algae growth and temperature fluctuations (subjective to where you live). You could use a regular pond cover, or perhaps DWC (Deep water culture) rafts.    Best of luck! :)"
aquaponics,342uib,desiderata_,1 point,Tue Apr 28 21:40:39 2015 UTC,"thanks for all your responses. I think having the pumped water going into a filter then going into the growbed would be the better design, i dont know why i didnt think of that.  @desiderata_   it would indeed be easier to use use a submersible pump but i read a bit about Bottom Drains a lot of people with ponds recommend it or wish they installed it when building their ponds. I will do further reading into BD before I decide to use it or not.  i never really considered putting a cover on my pond but a DWC raft or NFT A frame over sounds interesting, I'll also consider it. also I live in Hawaii so temperature is not really an issue. its warm here all year around."

I wouldn't say you fucked up though, many of these parasites are coevolved with fish and do little damage to them if they are healthy.   another thing is Tubifex worms are often fed to fish and other aquatic life, both freeze dried and live.   I have never had a problem with Nematodes, I know there are at least a few species in my system as I have looked at the muck under a microscope on more than one occasion.  I think things like this are unavoidable in most cases."
aquaponics,33x5ao,Sycosys,2,Sun Apr 26 15:38:31 2015 UTC,It's reading things like this that get me worried.     Humans who have consumed raw or undercooked fish that carry the larval stages of the parasite have experienced gastritis or inflammation of the stomach and intestinal perforation requiring surgical removal of worms.     Ain't nobody got time for that.
aquaponics,33x5ao,Sycosys,2,Sun Apr 26 15:51:47 2015 UTC,I 100% agree. That's why you have to cook your fish thoroughly or not eat them. I gave up on growing harvest-able fish last fall an have been rocking the goldfish so risks of this are 0
aquaponics,33x5ao,olov244,2,Sun Apr 26 16:17:47 2015 UTC,"So do you think this kind of infection is ubiquitous in aquaculture? I see some farms in Florida that are completely open to the environment, just makes me wonder. In lieu of axing everything, I'm thinking I might just fill my rearing tanks with goldfish for awhile and watch for signs of infection. Then maybe in a month or two move back towards stocking it with tilapia."
aquaponics,33x5ao,DecalArtist,1 point,Sun Apr 26 16:29:03 2015 UTC,I think you are going to be very hard pressed to not encourage a thriving ecosytem ranging from the smallest anerobic bacteria all the way up through primary consumers within a healthy aquaponics system.. There are simply too many species evolved to take advantage of the favorable conditions we create with our AP systems to expect to keep them out. I guess the best we can strive for is creating a complete ecosystem where no single species can overrun and cause trouble. There are a swarm of predatory nemotodes that happily gobble up the problematic ones.   I'd hold course and check on your goldfish regularly before worrying too much about it.
aquaponics,33x5ao,Trailmagic,2,Sun Apr 26 16:37:35 2015 UTC,"Exactly. If juvenile fish are more susceptible to the ill effects of these worms, I might as well forgo the tilapia fingerlings for now and just observe some expendable goldfish for awhile. Thanks for the input."
aquaponics,33x5ao,DecalArtist,2,Sun Apr 26 18:21:53 2015 UTC,"from the link it sounds like only certain fish eat the worms(mosquito fish, etc), and if the worms aren't eaten they probably die out. but I've also seen videos of fish from the grocery store with worms in it, nasty yes, but that's why we cook fish fully, to kill the stuff we can't see"

aquaponics,33x5ao,Polyneophite,3,Sun Apr 26 15:00:25 2015 UTC,"I don't see how thoroughly cooking the fish wouldn't render them safe to eat. What are you scared of? It would have to be able to survive the rain barrel/tank AND  be infectious to both birds and humans AND use fish exposed to bird waste as a vector. Then it has to survive cooking. These requirements limit the pathogens of concern to a very small number, and factors like probability of contact with infected birds/multiple immune systems/cooking leave me more concerned about baby spinach from the grocery store."

aquaponics,33xbvt,Caseycrowe,2,Sun Apr 26 15:19:54 2015 UTC,"Awesome! I'm so glad you posted, I had wondered how your build was coming along. Looks like you got the water flow problem sorted out!  Also noticed you're wanting to cycle the water/fish. You're going to want to get that water circulating through your media ASAP. Because that's where the bacteria will colonize in any useful numbers. If you just leave your fish in the tank with the Ammonia, they'll die.  The standard test kit is the API Master Freshwater test kit.   You'll also probably want to have pool salt ready for when your Nitrites start peaking. I lost a fish today to (I'm pretty sure) Nitrite poisoning, despite adding the salt. But it was only one, so...   Good idea on rinsing/flushing those buckets really well first, too. That sediment will collect and get into stuff. Sometimes it's not a problem, but with your small tubes, I wonder if it will build up and clog the small ports?   Anyways, looks like it's coming right along!  edit: I got that blog started: https://foodandfish.wordpress.com/ I've got more to add, just want to space the content out a bit and not post it all in one day. :)"

The Tupperware container is from a local hardware store. Same with the wood for the stand.  The only tricky bit was the bell syphon. If you have a drill, there is a bit that will fit the opening of a 5 hour energy bottle perfectly. Then you can drill a hole in the lid and place the Tupperware inbetween the bottle and the lid and tighten for a seal. Then I had to experiment to figure out the flow to get the sphon working."

aquaponics,33w11x,umami2,2,Sun Apr 26 04:12:44 2015 UTC,"The key to endless fish tacos is creating a balanced pond environment. Tilapia are great fish, so I hear, but I am not able to grow them because of the temperature fluctuations, so I just use Goldfish and Koi. The point is to get the ammonia from the fish, then to use mechanical, biological, and phytological filtration to clean the water. For a pond, the point is to get clear water. For an Aquaponics system, the point is to make your phytofiltration into a garden. Mechanical filtration removes the solids, biofiltration converts the ammonia to nitrates (plant food), which is then consumed by your plants. Without getting into all the other issues (potassium, phosphorus, iron, etc) it's pretty damn easy to get something like this up and running. I must say, that you will need more than a 'minimal amount' of fish, though, if you want to do this. More fish = more plants. I have never tried NFT because of the issues related to solids getting past the filtration and coating the roots. If this happens they stop consuming the nutrients. For my purposes, I use ebb / flow trays and constant drain trays.   Cabbage, cilantro, and chives are easy. Garlic, Onions, and such are harder because they are bulbs, but possible. Limes, Lemons, Avocado, fruit trees are harder. .. Because they are trees. But all this is possible if you can dial in your system. There is another post here somewhere where someone is growing AP fruit trees, you might want to look into his experiences. That, and read, read, read. Because there is a lot that needs to be done before your endless supply of fish tacos can become a reality."
aquaponics,33w11x,CogitoNM,2,Sun Apr 26 18:23:21 2015 UTC,"I am in contact with a couple people I am helping out with converting commercial scale marijuana ( Colorado ) hydro to AP.    The way they've been going about things is to slowly switch over using a form of compost ( get kitchen scraps, bury them under media, run the system through it ) as well as some massive weekly water exchanges to get the metal out.  An NFT system might not need equivalent changes as you can swap your pots out as needed.  At this point I think they're 90 days into the process and starting to introduce feeder goldfish with very little deaths.  Additionally I believe /u/ponicwars has a commercial system thats like hydro.  Fish are in their own system, water is added, excess carrying ammonia/nutrients is flushed to fish and then that is flushed out like a hydro run to drain system.  I really like that idea as hydro has a lot more control and the components can run to some extent independent of each other."

The media he uses can be found here in the medium density (although he hasn't really tried other densities so that might be worth a shot).  The only reason I think this has an edge on foam is because the water shouldn't wick to the top of the media as easily and is sheltered from light exposure (algae growth).

aquaponics,33pfkn,Optimoprimo,5,Fri Apr 24 14:12:44 2015 UTC,"It also might be good to add pH stabilizers. Nitrification should be keeping your system much lower than pH 8, so you might have something in your system that is over-buffering the water. Or your municipal water might be very alkaline. Give it a test as well. This isn't always the only reason you have iron deficiency; often you'll have to supplement iron regardless. A lower pH just keeps the iron free and not precipitated."
aquaponics,33pfkn,Spitinthacoola,1 point,Fri Apr 24 15:47:04 2015 UTC,Iron deficiency is pretty common but pH isn't helping. Just remember to fix ph very slowly like .2 ever day or your fish will be really sad.

aquaponics,33pfkn,Polyneophite,1 point,Fri Apr 24 14:13:11 2015 UTC,I second Iron though with tomatoes Mg is also a possibility. If it was a nitrogen deficiency your numbers would be at zero most likely.
aquaponics,33pfkn,DownRoots,1 point,Wed Apr 29 23:10:10 2015 UTC,"A lack of nitrogen would cause yellowing over the entire leaf.  This is interveinal chlorosis (yellowing while the veins remain green).  If this is happening with older leaves it is a magnesium deficiency.  It's it's newer growth, than it's iron.  In all my systems magnesium deficiency has been rare, so it's almost certainly iron related.  As another commented, this may be due to iron lockout since your pH is higher than is ideal.  A nitrification cycle naturally brings pH down, so I have personally never had to manually lower pH.  So perhaps someone else here can provide advice on forcing down the pH."

Might consider dumping it in the bottom of the second filter and shove a lot of airstones and composing worms in there too. If what I did yesterday with stiffening up the filters works, that would catch most big solids that make it through the radial flow filter. And hydroton and worms should take care of the rest, and with lots of air stones it should mineralize in there rather than get anaerobic. Taking the whole trash can out and cleaning it would be a PITA, but if I can just worry about the filters on top every few weeks and get the Hydroton to be pretty maintenance free for at least a year, that would be an okay solution."

If they were shocked by initial water conditions, they'd be gone within a couple days. An entire week makes me think they're succumbing to ammonia, nitrite, or even hydrogen sulfide buildup, all depending on how well your system is processing the fish waste.  How well do you aerate?    Try topping off the media bed and maybe filling that adjacent DWC with media as well, you could just leave it as a constant flow without having to re-plumb, same difference really.

Those three are now 12-15 inches and I feel like I could maybe add one or two more. I also have 15 bluegill as well.   The place I get my fish I can choose the size. I can go small (few inches), medium (4-6 inches), or big (8-10 inches). Maybe, if possible, start with a few small ones and let them grow a bit and then get a few medium sized to add in. The thing with catfish is they grow really slow. I've had mine well over a year and I started with around small size. If you plan on eating them maybe start with a few large ones and then a few months later add a few more large.   Or maybe after checking your water conditions, add a few cheap goldfish to make sure everything is good before adding the catfish.   If you have other questions ask me.

Later I tried to lower my pH and went way too low to where they were at the surface and seemed to be gasping for air, and also turned almost orange color. They survived all of this.   Start slow and go from there."

aquaponics,338hff,ghostcicada,2,Mon Apr 20 14:17:58 2015 UTC,"Greetings fellow Wisconsinite!  1) If you want to not worry about what to do with your fish in the fall, you can get tilapia. When they get big enough and it is getting cold again, you just pull them out and freeze them to eat them later. Otherwise you can put koi in your pond. They're pretty. But they live a long time and get huge. You'll need to plan a place for them inside for the winter.   2) Nutrients in your water are dissolved, so they can't be mechanically filtered out. They can be chemically filtered out with activated carbon, which you should avoid.   3) I'd drain it and see if you can dry it over a few sunny days. This will ensure any diseases or hitchhikers are killed. If you're filling this pond exclusively with rain water, keep in mind that rain water has absolutely no dissolved solids in it. Things that keep a healthy ecosystem like trace minerals (iron, potassium) and carbonate will have to be supplemented occasionally. Most trace minerals will be present in the fish waste, but that depends on you giving the fish a good feed. Make sure you have backup water stored, since usually water evaporates much faster than it rains.  4) A battery powered pump sounds awful, but it also sounds like you aren't planning to recirculate the water. As long as the pump isn't being used for constant circulation, it should be fine. If you're looking to constantly recirculate the water, that battery pump is a terrible option. I'd set up a filter so you can catch the solids made by the fish. Those solids are excellent fertilizer.  5) Plants grown aquaponically grow like weeds because there is never a moment they are deficient of anything they need. This isn't exactly what you're doing. But using pond water will keep you from needing to supplement store-bought fertilizers. You seem to have a larger growing area than fish stocking area, which may not be a huge problem since you aren't recirculating.  Your next step should be reading the FAO Report on the sidebar to the right, and researching how much water you'll be pulling out of that pond on a regular basis. It may be stressful on the fish if you're taking 1/4 of the water out multiple times per week. Chemical fluctuations are very rough on fish and the natural balance of the pond system. I would only pull out pond water for irrigation after testing the water chemistry and ensuring my nitrates are high and ammonia/nitrites are low."
aquaponics,338hff,Optimoprimo,1 point,Mon Apr 20 15:36:49 2015 UTC,"Thanks so much for your feedback.   1) Where can I get grown live tilapia in Wisconsin, and about how much are they per fish? Do I have to jump through any hoops with the DNR or licensing?   4) I accidentally typed ""battery"" when I didn't mean to. It's a DC 15v 340 GPH pump that I intended to use to pump water from the barrels through the drip system. In addition to that I have a fountain recirculating pump that sits on the bottom of the pond and makes a little waterfall in the middle of the pond.   Thanks again!"
aquaponics,338hff,Optimoprimo,2,Mon Apr 20 16:27:58 2015 UTC,"Depends on where you are in WI, but I get mine from R&D Aquafarms, based in Oshkosh. Prices are on their website. They're dirt cheap considering a single koi can be 15-20 dollars. The one predicament you are in is their time to full size is about 9 months. But this is if you order fry. I usually start mine indoors and bring them out in late Spring. It might be beneficial for you to get older fish, in the 4-5'' range. Also Tilapia prefer slightly warmer temps, so on cold nights (ugh for Wisconsin that can mean well into June) you may want to invest in a heater to keep them above 72 degrees F. Tilapia are hardy, but if their water dips below 6F8-70F, they become very unhappy.  Here is some info on Wisconsin permits and regulation of fish farms. Don't let it intimidate you. It's very easy, if you call them they'll tell you exactly what you need to fill out.  Or go with koi. As you can see there are pros and cons to both. For me, the tiny extra effort is worth it because my tilapia are delicious; the filets last me several months in the freezer. And I don't want giant fish to deal with all winter."
aquaponics,338hff,cocacholas,2,Mon Apr 20 17:37:47 2015 UTC,"So in my opinion this is a question from a beginner but doesn't really have a beginner answer. A setup like this is possible but isn't entirely practical.  From what I read you want to transfer nutrient rich water from a pond (approx 350 gallon) to water traditional soil beds and refill that pond with collected rain water. That's certainly possible. What you're going to have issues with is filtration and keeping track of your nitrate levels.  What would make sense to me is creating a secondary loop using traditional aquaponic methods. That way you'll create adequate biofiltration to convert the waste into nitrates, and have a more constant source of nitrate removal. At that point you can do water changes using your collected rain water, and discarding your extra pond water into your soil beds.  This is a situation where creating monitoring and automation hardware/software would be really interesting to me, but is definitely an advanced project."

aquaponics,336twk,creekhopper,2,Mon Apr 20 02:12:08 2015 UTC,"Looks fine but you could easily get more bang for your buck by adding a much larger growing area. It will provide more surface area for biolfiltration. A smarter option would be to cut circles in the top and use net cups. Water will get foggy as the system cycles. You added a good deal of fish to start so your ammonia is going to spike fairly high. Monitor your chemistries. Although this looks like you took pictures immediately after setting it up... there are still degassing bubbles on the sides of the container. If the gravel was dirty when you put it in, the circulation from the airstone may keep that crap suspended. Hard to tell until some time has passed. Also you may want to block some light on the sides or you will have an algea-ridden nightmare. Finally, I don't know how well tomatoes do in deep water culture, but the way you have the airstone may help."
aquaponics,336twk,Optimoprimo,2,Mon Apr 20 03:17:57 2015 UTC,I grew beefsteaks in a constant fill bed last year (starting again this year) As long as the water is high in O2 the tomatoes love it.
aquaponics,336twk,Sycosys,2,Mon Apr 20 13:13:45 2015 UTC,"I am not sure the minnows and snails will provide enough bio-load for an eventual mature fruiting tomato plant. Also, adding crawfish would be bad, as they'd catch and eat your minnows. I don't see much in the way of surface area to assist in biofiltration happening, but I'm still quite novice in all this so I could be wrong."
aquaponics,336twk,froschkonig,0,Mon Apr 20 02:31:36 2015 UTC,You're correct with your surface area comment. Atleast a 1:1 growbed:fishtank volume is recommended to allow enough surface area for bacteria to develop. Your fish will die from ammonia or nitrite poisoning before you know it.  I have a 40 gallon fishtank and 55 gallon growbed and currently have 17 minnows... mind you I have no issue with ammonia/nitrite/nitrate yet but I'm going to wait before adding more. I either recommend adding a lot more biofiltration or removing fish. How long have you been running the system?  On a less important note the dust will settle. Are you sure the gravel is inert ?
aquaponics,336twk,MilkCurds,1 point,Mon Apr 20 03:03:36 2015 UTC,How would I add biofiltration? The system has been running for two days and I have no idea if the gravel is inert.
aquaponics,336twk,CogitoNM,1 point,Mon Apr 20 03:24:20 2015 UTC,More ammonia from the fish equals more nitrifying bacteria. That makes a basket of pea gravel into a biofilter. It just takes a bit of time.
aquaponics,336twk,ThisNerdyGuy,1 point,Mon Apr 20 06:54:33 2015 UTC,"Check your gravel to make sure it is inert!   My system cycled for two months (fishless at first) but my chemistry WOULD NOT mellow out. My pH was swinging wildly high (8.2+). Finally, after working my way thru possibly causes...gravel was the only thing left to check.  Get a small handful of gravel and out it in a cup with a bit of vinegar. If you see ANY bubbles coming off the gravel, it is not inert and you will have continual pH issues.   I wound up dumping my cheap gravel and forming over the dough for hydroton pebbles."
aquaponics,336twk,Canucklehead99,1 point,Mon Apr 20 11:18:29 2015 UTC,you can buy beneficial bacteria too from pond places.
aquaponics,336twk,MilkCurds,1 point,Mon Apr 20 15:03:10 2015 UTC,Biofiltration occurs on the surfaces of everything in your system. The gravel is your main source of biofiltration right now because it has a high surface area. You can increase it by adding an extension onto your system with more gravel for bacteria to grow on.   The best way I see you doing this is   finding a table or some kind of support to put a container much like your fish tank right over the tank(filled with gravel). Before adding gravel you can add a siphon (lots of videos on youtube for diy) that will drain to your tank and use a pump to cycle the water to the growbed. If you have any other questions and concerns feel free to pm me. I'm not an expert but have built a couple small systems and gone through the process of cycling a system a few times now.

aquaponics,335vyz,growingplants48,3,Sun Apr 19 21:09:31 2015 UTC,"The siphon IS your timer. The whole point of a siphon is to allow for periods of fill and periods of empty. You adjust the duration of your fill/drain cycles by adjusting your flow rate.  With a timer, you just need a standpipe with small holes at the bottom and allow the bed to fill faster than the small bottom holes can drain. It will fill to the top of the standpipe until the timer shuts the pump off, at which point it will drain to the bottom holes.  If you put both together, your pump will shut off while the water is at random levels in the growbed, or empty, and it will stay that way until the pump turns back on. Not ideal."

If it isn't already, your fish tank needs an air pump so the fish don't suffocate and as long as you don't have a high stocking level, they won't produce that much ammonia ( unless you feed them just before everything shuts down, then that could be problematic ).  I haven't noticed any issues doing that and it cuts down evaporation losses.  Beyond water loss control, there doesn't seem like there would be much benefit.  My system runs 10 on, 14 off."

My advice to you is measure your desired water level in your sump/fish tank and draw a line with felt marker for reference. It's probably a good idea to wait until your grow bed(s) finish a drain cycle before you draw the line, for the sake of consistency. Once you do this, you'll be able to eyeball your water loss (again, after a drain cycle, for consitency). If you want to be more accurate you can refill your system with 5gal buckets to see how much it takes to bring you back up to your marked water level, and log your measurements. Hope this helps :)"

aquaponics,32vnds,alwaysthevillain,2,Fri Apr 17 02:17:58 2015 UTC,"Welcome! To start: on the sidebar you'll see the FAO Small Scale Aquaponics Report that will answer all your questions and provide you with most of what you'll need to know. But I'll help you with those questions a little if I can:  1) No. Not while they're growing anyway. Adults do need room to swim. I've seen all kind of suggestions on this, and it's largely related to your filtration. I've seen 1 gallon per inch of fish, 1 fish per 10 gallons.. stock conservatively and then track your nitrites. If they're falling, add more fish. Rising too high - you overstocked. Pull a fish or do water changes until the plants catch up. The amount of fish that the system can handle increases as the plants grow and decreases as the fish grow. If you're a broke college student and going small, don't bother with koi right now.  2) Comet goldfish aren't much different stocking-wise, they're just smaller and very cheap. Minimum give them a 10 gallon.  3) It's good to use feed specifically made for this purpose because whole feeds provide micronutrients that you want to end up in the plants. Fish flakes won't get you there. Aquanourish seems to be what everyone goes for, but someone else may have other suggestions.  4) Make sure the plastic is a food-safe type. Many plastics are mixed with chemicals to keep them flexible; these will leach into your water. BPA is less of an issue these days but still one to watch for.   5) If you're thinking growbeds, perlite or river rock is good and cheap. Lava rocks are usually cheap as well, but I've never used them personally.  6) Nothing if you're doing growbeds. Those solids will hang out in the media and decompose, mineralizing all those goodies to feed the plants.   7) Many people do algea eaters and that's fine. You limit light in the fish tank to minimize algea, but there's almost always at least a little.  8) You can grow anything in AP if you do it right. Decide on the space you have available and make sure to read up on how people grow the plants you like in AP.  9) Entirely depends on the volume of your system. It's all relative. You'll need to cycle the system to start as well. If you haven't kept aquariums before, brush up on aquarium biology before you start.  10) This isn't really a metric we use in aquaponics. It depends on the size of your fish, feeding amount, and your growing area.  11) Chew on that FAO report. Feel free to ask follow up/clarification questions when you'd like!"

I have used these as my fish tanks with these as the bio/phyto filter. They work great, easily customizable with bulkheadfittings and whatnot, and best of all they're essentially food-grade. I talked with a Rubbermaid rep once who said they don't qualify for food grade because of a UV resistant ingredient, which is essentially food grade but not officially food grade.   Though, they aren't quite the prettiest things.   Either way. Use a good and solid tank and you won't have to worry about something breaking and everything spilling onto your patio."

Think about it this way - sunlight during peak vegetative months (may-july for the northern hemisphere) tends to look more blue due to the higher angle of the sun in the sky. the higher color temperature mimics this. sunlight during the autumn, when most plants flower or fruit, tends to be at a lower angle in the sky and more red - a lower color temperature.  also i read a lot about growing high potency pot and this stuff is very important in that"

Making everything look nice also means you have to hide all of your plumbing and electronics, which becomes a pain in the ass when it inevitably needs maintenance. Also the open concepts make evaporation an issue, as well as wild animals stealing your products. If you go this route, the best way to make your setup look nice is to build wooden frames around everything ugly using a good water resistant wood. Put hinges in many areas so you can still access stuff when you need to. You can also use stones and concrete. Some people also set their sump underground or in cement. Expect to double your construction costs."

It can get expensive, but I've been pleasantly surprised many times just how cheap it is to make something look super elegant and functional with a little extra elbow grease.  That's a common misconception.  People think a house with a super fancy interior/exterior must be expensive, but often the fanciest parts can be done next to nothing.

What is ""traditional farming""? Farmers all over the world grow every crop there is in every way conceivable, so it's a gross generalization to say AP uses X amount less than traditional farming.   If you wanted a statement that would hold up to academic scrutiny, you'd have to get real data from a commercial farm regarding their yields, water usage, and watering method, and compare that to an aquaponic producer growing the same thing in a similar climate.   When I give tours of our system, I say ""Aquaponics uses a little water as possible. We cover all of our surfaces to minimize evaporation and so the majority of our water loss comes from transpiration as the plants perform photosynthesis. Our two 20,000 gallon systems lose about 2% of their volume each day, and our monthly water bill stays at about $100."""

What I can tell you is that my family owns a commercial nursery. When I was growing up we used sprinklers to water the grow plots and it took hours and hours to water. Today we use drip lines using the same (Or close) flow rate. (We use the same single rate well pump for years, extra pressure goes to holding tanks on the ground). Today we run for around 20 minutes, the savings in power was astronomical.  You just are not throwing water all over the place anymore.   Edit: spelling which I am sure is still bad."

The amount of clay dust that comes off the stuff when it's new is terrible enough. I wouldn't think you couldn't solve OP's issue with some diligence. How are people getting rid of the dust, anyway?  I'm just starting my setup over after a big move, and my hydroton (aka grow!t) has cracked a bunch and is dusty as hell all over again. When I set it up the first time, I had to rinse the hell out of the stuff. I kept it in the bags it came in, stabbed holes in the bags and washed it through with a hose, digging in with my arm shoulder deep to stir the stuff around.

Not wanting to spoil your work, but just know this is a question we have known the answer to for 20 years. Obviously any thermoregulation of the water has an associated cost that is best avoided. Also keep in mind we usually have the opposite problem. Our water overheats easily due to the sun beating down on a shallow amount of water - even in the Midwest. Tolerance ranges of different plant and fish species with an associated growth curve could be pretty cool though!"
aquaponics,32knsk,Optimoprimo,2,Tue Apr 14 16:04:41 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the reply! We're also evaluating current market prices to see if the profit one would make growing perch would be more than tilapia.

aquaponics,32knsk,Optimoprimo,4,Tue Apr 14 16:14:12 2015 UTC,"I'm surprised you are using such a small temperature difference - 24C vs 26C. Tilapia can be kept even warmer, like 28C. Perch can be kept even cooler, as low as 20C. Why didn't you push the difference further? I know the stress limit for Perch is around 26C, but both species could be kept below 24C as a lower limit. Granted it's not easy to keep water at 20C in the summer."
aquaponics,32knsk,Optimoprimo,6,Tue Apr 14 16:41:43 2015 UTC,"We couldn't go lower than 24C because that's ambient temp of the water in our greenhouse; we don't have the capability of cooling the water. We also didn't want to go above 26C because, as you said, the stress limit of Perch is around 28C, I believe. We didn't want to kill any fish (the university had to deal with a lot of animal rights stuff in order for us to even use fish) and they would have stopped eating around that temp."
aquaponics,32knsk,Spitinthacoola,2,Tue Apr 14 17:12:04 2015 UTC,"So what you just said reinforces a possible issue for you - as the sun beats on your systems, I wouldn't be surprised if they get well over 26 degrees. How are you going to ensure a constant lower temperature if the sun decides to heat it? Recirculating water has a habit of changing temp quickly. And gets into the fact that keeping water cool is just as much of an issue worth consideration."
aquaponics,32knsk,Optimoprimo,2,Tue Apr 14 20:08:40 2015 UTC,Isn't this something that is mostly already known? I'd be more interested about systemic chemical changes interaction with temp and how they relate to fish though this is obviously extremely complex.

aquaponics,32knsk,wilfredthedestroyer,2,Wed Apr 15 17:37:22 2015 UTC,"Electric heaters alone are not the the answer. You have many heating options what will affect cost of heating.   Heat loss also largerly controlled by ventilation, insulation and mostly, water exchanges. With low water exchanges your water heating costs drop down dramatically.  The profitability of the system goes much much much beyond than electricity expenditures. Especially in a place like the US where rates are ridiculously cheap compared with other parts of the world. Labour and feed will be much more important. Especially when you are comparing a fast growing species with a slow growing one. Producing yellow perch will be by all other means aside from electricity,more expensive because you need to feed them higher quality feed for much much longer, which increases the size, feed and labout input of your farm for a given production target in comparison to tilapia.   Electricity is about 15% of the total operating cost. This does not invalidate your experiment, but it important that the big picture is not lost."

Also, if you're all in the foodie/sustainability majors, I'd love to get coffee and exchange knowledge (I am a total noob and more accurately, want to mine your knowledge) at Mim's.   Best of luck!"
aquaponics,32knsk,Optimoprimo,1 point,Tue Apr 14 20:34:35 2015 UTC,"I appreciate the excitement! It's definitely a fun class, however it still seems pretty thrown together (as it's still a brand new class). You get to choose your own group project so the possibilities are broad. I'd recommend a project that actually works with the fish, considering this is an aquaponics class; many groups chose projects that don't even work with the fish directly; where is the fun in that?? I'm going to message you more about the class from my other account as professors might view this in the future.."
aquaponics,32knsk,DavidSlain,1 point,Tue Apr 21 14:45:20 2015 UTC,"Hi - U of Michigan student here. We have a aquaponics student project team, but no classes are offered here with an aquaponics topic.   I think it's so cool that you get to have hands on classroom experience and experiment with fish in an aquaponics system.   We are in the phase of designing an original aquaponics system in order to provide a sustainable food source for the local community. We have decided that tilapia will best fit our interests, but that decision is only based on what we've found doing research online. We would love to get in contact with you to possibly consult you in our project.   Please PM me if you'd like to discussing getting involved! Your research could benefit our project immensely."

aquaponics,32jfyk,kingrootintootin,3,Tue Apr 14 16:42:06 2015 UTC,"Zero. There are no medium sized profitable aquaponic systems.  If this was ""proven"" many would be out there doing it. But even large systems where peopke have put their life savings on, have failed to make money.   A small family needs a whole farm to sustain itself.You need to sustain a house, earn maybe one salary or two and keep the farm running. You need a farm the size of a farm to achieve this. Regarless of you using soil, water or air to grow the plants, you need certain scale to make the volumes of prodution high enough.   We still have to see an aquaponic farm the size of a small farm.   The only way to reduce size is to increse the price of the product. And THAT is difficult unless you manage to tap into high-eng hipster market where you can trick your people into buying your more expensive product or where competition is so scarce you can afford to charge more.   You need hundreds of thousands, if not millions, to make an aquaponic system of the right scale."

With the interest in marijuana and the very open nature of the soon to be legal recreational market with FORCED locality at the time being, it has possibility for people to start a ""medium sized"" business with a reasonable initial investment and bring in enough money to grow with the industry"

To me, medium setups would be in the 50k-100k range in terms of startup costs. Anything below that I'd consider a hobby farm and unlikely to make profit. But I'm thinking that's not what you have in mind. Many of us would love to live off of this but it's nearly impossible without investors.

aquaponics,32ihzk,EvansCantStop,1 point,Tue Apr 14 13:52:22 2015 UTC,You can still use municipal water. Add ascorbic acid. Also known as vitamin C. You don't need much either. Enough that it lowers the pH from 7 to about 6.8. I also have chloramine and have done this for years with no problems.

aquaponics,32g8u6,Whittigo,3,Mon Apr 13 15:31:16 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure about plucking new growth, but I train my tomatoes by gently wrapping thread at a node and tethering them down in the orientation I want them. They're very tolerant to it as long as you don't snap them. I like most of my tall plants to vine outward so they don't hog sunlight.   Asparagus get big and bushy. They like a lot of root freedom. I don't even think it's nutrient related. From what I know, they get stronger and grow more shoots each year from wintering over in the ground.  That will be a work around to consider as well."
aquaponics,32g8u6,Optimoprimo,2,Mon Apr 13 16:12:15 2015 UTC,"Kinda figured that about the Asparagus from what I have been reading. But I was holding out hope. Probably going to just tear them  out and do something else. I like asparagus and would love to have it. But I'd rather get a lot of other food now. I'd try to transplant them into the ground somewhere, but I'm moving this year hopefully so I'll never get to eat them anyway."
aquaponics,32g8u6,Optimoprimo,2,Mon Apr 13 16:22:08 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I've heard gardeners say that good asparagus in your yard can be a reason to renovate your home instead of move. Every successive year they get better and grow more shoots, but there's no way to speed up the process."
aquaponics,32g8u6,denjin,1 point,Mon Apr 13 19:01:21 2015 UTC,"I will definitely experiment with them when I move. I might take these out of the grow bed and put it in a pot for now. Let it grow roots in the pot, pop it in the ground when I move. Certainly won't be ideal root growth, but at least a head start from nothing."
aquaponics,32g8u6,Optimoprimo,2,Mon Apr 13 19:22:21 2015 UTC,"Asparagus is a strange beast, personally I wouldn't even attempt to grow it in an AP system. They're root systems get absolutely huge before you get anything like a decent crop of spears.  I know a lady locally to me who owns an asparagus bed that has some plants nearly 20 years old and they're the best producers. She grows nothing else in the 40' polytunnel that houses them and they crop over a 4 week period.  So much wasted space and time will just end up making your system inefficient, stick to more productive crops!  As for the tomatoes, you want to pinch out any side shoots - those are the bushier branches that spring from an already branched node. Like this allowing these to grow out will just result in the plant devoting more energy to growing leaves rather than fruit."
aquaponics,32g8u6,denjin,2,Mon Apr 13 18:54:38 2015 UTC,"So, I'm wondering - do those side shoots never grow fruit? If they do, I'd be inclined to keep them. If not, or fruit is less likely, then I absolutely get where you're coming from. I've never made the effort to pay attention."
aquaponics,32g8u6,Optimoprimo,2,Mon Apr 13 19:04:44 2015 UTC,"No, they never produce fruit. Every book on tomatoes or any tomato growing expert will tell you the same - always pinch out your side shoots."

I thought it might have been an issue with a longer bed, so I put two legs between the outer ones. Hopefully it should be enough. I haven't had any bending from the old beds.

After watching the video, you're exactly right on why water comes out well on one side and not the other. That's the exact issue I had with mine. I have two growbeds and they're not level with one another because they're slightly on a hill. So I had to use ball valves on the low side to restrict, and let the high side flow open. You'll either have to do something like that, or move your plumbing up so they all feed at the same level. But don't forget that you have those mister things on one side, too. And I'm guessing they're going to need some good pressure to flow properly. So that may make it even more difficult to get going. Maybe you should use one pump for one side, and one for the other?   Guess I was wrong about the 10' spray! :)  Thanks for the update. I'm going to be posting mine up here shortly."

aquaponics,328dsr,zynix,1 point,Sun Apr 12 15:06:49 2015 UTC,Your pH got to low. With a pH of 6 you have 0 KH so your pH was flying all over the place from day to nite. That caused them to have a weakened immune system which then allowed the infection to spread quickly. All your other water parameters are perfectly fine. Tilapia prefer water at 7.8 if they had the choice so bringing them all the way down to a 6 or if you were using an API kit probably lower will kill them all on its own but you combine that with the pH fluctuations you get with having basically 0 KH at that ph level and you get all the makings of a fish disaster. Keep that pH stable and if it were my system Id let it sit for at least 2 weeks with no fish before trying to introduce a new fish just to be on the safe side. Most but not all fish pathogens need a host in a 2 week period with a few exceptions so 2 weeks is how long I would quarantine before reintroduction. It sounds like you had a pH crash to me. PH is lowered over time by the nitrification process and pH must be maintained in an aquaponic system usually using calcium or potassium carbonates. This is common with new aquarium keepers as well so don't get discouraged. The other thing I would also look into just because of how fast your fish died off is make sure nothing fell into the system or was put into the system that was toxic. Things like neem and other normally safe pest solutions can wipe fish out as well.
aquaponics,328dsr,PotentPonics,2,Sat Apr 11 16:15:23 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the reply. Though I'm new to tilapia, I've been raising freshwater fish for 15 years. This is the first time I've suffered a loss like this. Failure is a bitter pill! After inspecting the tank, nothing appears out of the ordinary. They are kept indoors in a sun room away from any chemicals. As for the pH, it's true tilapia prefer 7-8, but they can survive 4-11. I keep log books on each tank, and the pH has been stable at 6.0 for several months. I use two test kits (one wide range test with 0.5 increments, the other is a fine range test with 0.2 increments), and they both agree on the measurement. My city's water is quite hard to begin with, and I also keep crushed oyster shell in the sump. It's very unlikely that the buffering capacity or a pH crash killed them off. What you said about pathogens and lack of a host makes a lot of sense, though I'm a bit concerned about bacteria living in the sand substrate."
aquaponics,328dsr,Pastelitomaracucho,4,Sat Apr 11 16:41:12 2015 UTC,"I used to work in a research lab developing strep vaccines for tilapia. The bacteria would usually kill them quickly without lots of external symptoms.   If you can completely ensure that your water quality was OK. a pH of 6, although low, it is not enough to kill the fish. pH alone is not a cause of stress: it is how pH affects other water quality parameters what causes the stress.   Of course, unless you can do a proper necropsy and run some tests, it would be practically impossible to understand exactly what pathogen killed (if the the actually died from disease).   The fish looked sick, that is for sure. Next time be prepared to cut fish open a do some gross pathology to be a little bit more certain.   To be sure, I would disinfect and restart the system."
aquaponics,328dsr,Pastelitomaracucho,1 point,Sat Apr 11 19:07:09 2015 UTC,"I value your comments, especially considering your background. The fish were certainly sick. Some of them had signs of hemorrhaging which is why I suspected disease. I will probably end up recycling the tank. Thanks again!"
aquaponics,328dsr,zynix,1 point,Sun Apr 12 03:16:58 2015 UTC,"The symptoms + the fact that more than one fish species died suggest it was bacteria. Some protozoans can also overwhelm a tank quickly, but you didn't have signs of those apparently.   Good luck"

aquaponics,328dsr,PotentPonics,1 point,Sun Apr 12 14:56:56 2015 UTC,How did you deal with the bloom? Seems like a UV filter might kill off the beneficial nitrifying bacteria as well?
aquaponics,328dsr,Aquaponics-Heretic,2,Sun Apr 12 16:43:41 2015 UTC,UV won't harm your biolayer but it will change the chelated iron in the water to something less desirable and cause zinc/boron problems.  Also a decent UV lab will/should be able to hand the volume in 10-12 hours.  So switch it on for a day then shut it back off for the next crisis.
aquaponics,328dsr,PotentPonics,1 point,Sun Apr 12 18:03:47 2015 UTC,"The loaches were the first to die (not surprised), then the tilapia. The pleco was the last to go. Whatever it was, it was nasty because he was one tough fish!"
aquaponics,328dsr,Aquaponics-Heretic,1 point,Sun Apr 12 16:42:39 2015 UTC,So if you haven't added any new fish to the system at all lately then we can determine its either being caused by temperature or pH swing that is causing the fish to stress because none of your other water readings are remotely high. The 2 biggest causes of fish sickness in aquaponics is temp swings or pH swings and since your pH is so low we can easily assume its that. A pH of 6 is not going to stay there long. Were you checking your pH at the same time each day? If so its very easy to get a similar reading each time but if you check that water 12 hours later your pH will be very different. This is very hard on the fish. This is more than likely your issue because again you don't have any other out of whack parameters and if you haven't added any new fish the only other way your going to get an outbreak is to stress the fish enough to weaken them enough to allow an already present pathogen to take off. a Tilapia will not survive in a pH of 4 very few fish will and tilapia is not one of them. You said you tested your pH at a 6 does either of your tests go below 6? Most common tests do not and will show a false reading of a 6 if its lower than a 6.  So if your pH was 4 it will show a 6 for example. Your pH is too low regardless you are locking out nutrients for no reason. You need to get your pH up to 6.8 - 7 ideally. The reason why KH matters is its very hard to maintain a min of 2KH which is required for bacteria health at a pH of 6. This means your pH stability will be low. The nitrifying bacteria will be fine. You can't do anything else in an aquaponic system because you can't add antibiotics to your growbeds or your sand because it will kill all of your bacteria and crash your cycle so your only option is to bring the pH up maybe raise the temp up to 80 or 82 to speed up the life cycle of anything in there and wait the 2 weeks. Unless you plan on recycling the entire system.
aquaponics,328dsr,PotentPonics,2,Sat Apr 11 21:37:20 2015 UTC,Your pH is too low regardless you are locking out nutrients for no reason.   Also not true.... almost ALL nutrients are available from pH 4.8 - 6.8..  Commercial hydroponics has operated for decades within the range of 5.8 - 6.6.. for this very reason....  More recently commercial hydroponics have lowered the operating range to between 4.8 - 6.2....
aquaponics,328dsr,Aquaponics-Heretic,1 point,Sun Apr 12 11:18:10 2015 UTC,Your most definitely making it harder for yourself as seen in the chart shown. Why do something less than ideal? Most commercial hydroponics are relying on the nutrients being instantly available instead of relying on bacteria like in an AP system. Again as I have said MANY times this is not s hydroponic system things work differently when you have microbes involved. This is why we don't keep an AP system in the 5s unless your solely setting it up for berries which I have done once.

Again as I have said MANY times this is not s hydroponic system things work differently when you have microbes involved.    I think you fundamentally misunderstand the process of nitrification in relation to aquaponics....   And are, perhaps misguidedly confusing the resulting nitrates with trace element uptake....  Regardless... in an AP system within the correct pH range for nutrient uptake... all the nitrates and nutrient trace elements... are available ALL the time.. for plant uptake... just as ""instantly"" as supplying them with a hydroponics formulation.. which requires exactly the same pH range for optimum nutrient uptake....

None of them to my knowledge has any direct relationship to Potassium... there is documentation reagrding Phosphorus and/or Iron... but these processes relate more to anaerobic processes... and should NEVER be utilised within a single loop AP system....  The often made claims to ""microbial activity being HIGHLY beneficial in your AP system"".... is more often than not an extrapolation from soil biology at best... or pure unproven straw hat witchcraftery or promotional magic.. than any demonstrated science...  There is evidence to suggest that ""other"" microbial ""activity"" can be detrimental to fish within closed loop systems....  And you would never see either the aquaculture or hydroponics industries deliberately include such processes within a closed loop recirculating methodology.....  This is both the reason that I have suggested that ""media beds"" have no place in commercial AP applications... and why (particularly) the aquaculture and hydroponics industries have been reticent to adopt AP.... especially when they observe the armchair pseudoscience bullocks being promoted.. often by the leaders of the AP ""industry"".... and/or their minnions..."

This is the most heavyly researched area of AP right now that im aware of. Its not unmonitourable or uncontrolable its very much both of those things. You can use tissue samples, and you can feed your microbes things that we know feed many of them and use that as a starting point in testing.  I'v spent the last year+ working with 2 companys to get a microbe feed nailed down while getting tissue samples the entire time. I have charts on what microbe feed boosted what and so on which will be coming out here in a few months when the tests are done but this is why we grow difficult plants like cannabis to full yields as hydro and other difficult plants with hard do maintain nutrient requirement in aquaponics. The other big thing is moisture and mycrorize. This is why media beds will always have a place in commercial AP. RAS is grean for leafy greens and as your largest portion of a commercial system I would absolutely agree. But its not the be all end all like you and others would have it be. Many crops will not grow in RAS no root crops no trees nothing with a odd or high nutrient requirement will come out the same as a hydro system. This is why any one growing difficult to grow plants is moving to wicking beds and dual root zones because it gives more control on how you maintain and feed your root system microbes. I know so much about this topic its stupid. Its why we are the only company growing and teaching cannabis growing. I also have a long list of hard to grow herbs at home all of which with strange or unconventional nutrient requirements."

aquaponics,328dsr,ScrubWay,1 point,Sun Apr 12 13:05:32 2015 UTC,Which part of....   True in algae pond based aquaculture... but total nonsense in a small volume AP system...   Did you fail to read.. :D  Perhaps you just don't understand the basis of pond based aquaculture... ;)
aquaponics,328dsr,PotentPonics,1 point,Sun Apr 12 13:51:29 2015 UTC,yes AP is the same thing you have a HIGH level of microbial activity that effects your available buffer from nite to day. Test your outdoor system every 3 hours for dKH with a kit that does .1 increments and you would be very surprised.  The plants and other living things in the system are also up taking nutrients some of which also effect available buffers and pH. Go test your system for dKH with a good kit every 2 hours during a good warm day.
aquaponics,328dsr,zynix,2,Sun Apr 12 16:53:16 2015 UTC,"Quite frankly, I don't think you know what you're talking about....  You appear to be extrapolating a cursory knowledge of blue/green algae and phytoplankton pond production techniques to an AP context... where they neither occur, or are encouraged... as similarly in RAS aquaculture...  Th effect of algael/ phytoplankton ""microbial"" activity has a relationship to pH & DO swings... through the resultant chemistries... and is monitored and controlled by direct and deliberate interventions to control the resultant chemistries... not the actual microbial processess....  As to testing for 0.1 increments... unless you have highly sophisticated and expensive laboratory equipment it's just not doable.... the colour based chemical and/or strip tests.. and naked eye determination just aren't capable of make such minute degrees of measurement....  And changes of 0.1 increments of dkH would NOT result in the 1 degree+ swings in pH that you continually claim.... You're making it up..."
aquaponics,328dsr,zynix,1 point,Mon Apr 13 06:15:52 2015 UTC,I'm not. I'v explained to you how to test this at home. You can buy a dH kit that will do .1 incriments at most pet shops this isnt a hard thing do do there. You can get a backup for less than $100. I have spent the last year working with 2 companys testing microbe feeders I WISH I could post teh chart I have no what feed does what microbe but I can't share that yet but needless to say you need to learn ALOT about microbes. I have so much data it stupid but unfortunately some times we have to finish stuff before we share it :) Shit I''d almost be willing to mail you a sensitive dKH kit just to end the argument with you.

As long as your water is oxygenated from circulation, root rot shouldn't be an issue. Bamboo evolved to have submerged roots, so the chances there are even less. What probably will happen, however, is the roots will catch solids and they will build up, eventually blocking your filter. The trapped solids could also form tiny anaerobic zones, which when disturbed can release nasty toxic byproducts from anaerobic bacteria. So I'd keep that in mind."

When I was at the store buying the fish, the girl suggested I put the additive stuff in to get rid of the cloramine. I totally forgot to check if we had it. So store closes at 9, it's 8:30, and I'm at home googling like mad and finding out we DO have added chloramine, and unlike chlorine, it will NOT off-gas. You must use an agent to bind it up. I didn't want to spend $15 on a bottle that will treat 1000g from the pet store when my system is 110g. So I called a local place and they had a $4 bottle and were right around the corner!

As the water flows from the tank to the bed, it first drops into a kitty litter bucket with the bottom cut off and holes drilled in the side below soil (yes, I use soil in my aquaponics system) level. I have to limit the food waste I put in, or it will cause a nitrogen spike. But I do put some food waste and lots of spent plants. The compost adds nutrients to the system and draws worms to the bin by the hundreds, where it is easy to gather them up and feed to the fish.   The soil and the compost do make the water rather murky. Oh, and it's a great way to process the solid waste from the fish."

aquaponics,324p3k,atomfullerene,1 point,Tue Apr 14 05:08:00 2015 UTC,"Just did a search and this is the first thing I came across.  Note that I don't 100% agree with the article; but found it interesting:  Some aquaponicists are doing really good things with their projects. However, some don’t have a clue how dangerous what they’re doing may be.  If you introduce compost and/or worms into your aquaponics system, you run the risk of bringing in dangerous or deadly varieties of E. coli such as H0157, 11 of which can kill an otherwise healthy adult human. There are 13 other species of E. coli that will make us very sick but not kill us, and they all come from warm-blooded animals and their excrement. Worms that have been bred in compost with even a microscopic amount of E. coli contamination, or compost containing even a microscopic amount of warm-blooded animal manure are safely usable on field crops according to organic certification standards. However, there is a requirement that the most recent application of such compost or worms (or worm castings) be at least 120 days prior to harvest of the produce. If your compost doesn’t contain manure, the problem is something else entirely, especially if you want organic certification.  If this is the case, you can’t use the compost because there is no way (currently) to prove to the satisfaction of the organic certification agencies that the compost truly does NOT contain any E. coli, and is safe for use. If you go ahead and use the worms or compost anyway, doing so will jeopardize or eliminate the possibility of your ever getting organic certification. This not only means your produce is worth less to the market, but also that you cannot ever legally use the word organic in your packaging or on your product or you will face a $10,000 fine per occurrence (which can mean per bag of product!).  The REAL problem with this technique is not the inability to achieve organic certification, but the very real possibility that your produce (contaminated with E. coli H0157 from the compost you added to your aquaponics system) kills someone who eats it uncooked. If we can develop composting systems that only use vegetable inputs and never any from warm-blooded animals, and keep them uncontaminated, then there’s a chance that we can obtain organic certification for these systems. Unfortunately, a visit from a single housefly that visited a pile of excrement ten seconds before is all that’s necessary to contaminate the compost, and compost is attractive to houseflies in a way that a row of aquaponic plants is not. This kind of technology needs to be carefully and methodically developed and tested before we depend on it to give us healthy food.  Now, having said all that, IF you are going to cook EVERYTHING that comes out of your aquaponics system to at least 165 degrees for at least 5 minutes (as the Chinese do), then you are safe from E. coli H0157, and you can go ahead and use whatever you wish in the system (even “night soil” as the Chinese have been doing for thousands of years!).  But these systems don’t NEED compost: we’ve had 200 lbs of tomatoes in a 3-month period from a single plant, and there is NO compost in our systems, just fish poop. ALL the dangerous E. coli come from warm-blooded animal excrement or waste products. There are no dangerous E. coli that come from cold-blooded animals, SUCH AS FISH. This is why pure aquaponics systems are safe for producing vegetables that will be consumed without cooking, such as tomatoes, lettuce, greens, and strawberries.

aquaponics,324p3k,bhsx,2,Fri Apr 10 19:37:02 2015 UTC,"Yeah I looked at that article before my tour because I wanted to try and figure out how my acquaintance's ""compost"" system worked.  The warning and concern is based of the preconceived notion that compost is plant matter, manure, water & air.  With AP compost the simplest approach is just plant matter rotting somewhere in the line in a setup that won't contaminate the entire system with debris.  Looking up the wiki for compost, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compost the basic setup they mentioned is basically AP cycling without fish or chemicals and in fact composting relies partially on the same bacteria as AP ( plants rot => ammonium => nitrite => nitrate )."
aquaponics,324p3k,hop_along_quixote,1 point,Sat Apr 11 03:38:08 2015 UTC,With the focus on maintaining nutrients I'm surprised more people don't compost leftover bits of plants after harvesting them. Like if you grow tomatoes wouldn't you want the nutrients in the vines and leaves to go back into your system? Seems like that would also provide a good spot for worms and solids mineralization. I can see the concern in adding things like banana peels from outside the system. But if it's mostly roots and plant bits from the system itself I don't see why there would be a concern.

Depending on the size of your growing area, think about shooting for 50-60, including the new system. It won't seem like much to start, but once they get to be a foot long you'll be glad you didn't go for 100. I'd put 100 in 750-1000 gallons. If you're on a tight budget, consider bypassing any more media beds and connecting your current media beds to your dwc and maybe add a nft area instead of another media bed. It will be much cheaper for you and your current media beds would supply more than enough mechanical and biofiltration for the whole loop.   In terms of buying them; make sure there are no permits or licenses you need. You're a non-profit school and you're in small government Texas, so things should be easy on you.

aquaponics,31ygfl,Optimoprimo,1 point,Fri Apr 10 00:09:30 2015 UTC,"The depth of the bed doesn't have much to do with the depth of the roots the plant wants and much more to do with filtration of the water. 12""/30cm is the normal common recommendation. If you want shallow beds for the plants because of weight you could do either NFT (nutrient film, a very thin layer of water in pipes) or trays of just water several inches deep, a shallow DWC (deep water culture) if you will, that all go through a separate filter first such as a radial flow filter.   I am not sure how you would set it up, maybe the filter on the top of the set up. The solids from the filter could then be drawn off and put into a separate mineralization tank with an air stone. Once they are digested/mineralized they can be added back to the system, or just tossed on some out door plants and the mineralization skipped. At 11 gal/min you are looking at a ~20gal filter set up to get a good 2 min retention time on the water, so thats a fairly large thing to have on top of the set up.  Just knowing that you would have to mix and clean the media moderately frequently and accepting that as the cost of shallow media beds may be the best bet with this design.   How thick where you thinking of making the grow beds? What type of media?"
aquaponics,31ygfl,Sycosys,1 point,Fri Apr 10 02:00:33 2015 UTC,"Evap can vary depending on so many factors, therefore it's difficult to have an ""evaporation per square meter"" metric. It will have to be measured experimentally for your specific setup. You can calculate power usage simply by checking the box of your water pump, lights, and air pump and adding the wattage.  There end up being other costs to calculate - fish feed and water maintenance. Your water won't stay perfectly balanced, and may need pH manipulation or nutrient supplementation. It's another thing that might be hard to calculate without experimentation on your system."

aquaponics,31t3li,killerbuddhist,7,Wed Apr 8 00:54:30 2015 UTC,"No. At least not in the ""hands off"" way the developer describes. There's typically an imbalance between what the plant can absorb and the waste the fish produces. The pH will run too high or too low depending on the hardness of the water used. Tiny systems are susceptible to abrupt chemistry changes. Trace ions that are required by the plant like iron and magnesium will run out without the naive owner understanding what's going on. This will especially happen with a UV sterilizer. There's no way to eliminate solids, so even though they promise never having to clean it, you absolutely will. Algea will grow because it's clear on all sides. And that basil plant won't sit pretty under the sad LED lights for long.  They always set up these things right before they shoot the video; if you would see what happened to those setups after the first two weeks, you likely wouldn't buy one. Especially not at the ridiculous price of $80.

aquaponics,31sejj,Optimoprimo,1 point,Tue Apr 7 20:33:49 2015 UTC,"To expand on that, algal growth leads to wide sweeps in gas content of the water and higher organic debris. During the day, the algae eat sun, carbon dioxide, and nutrients, and breathe out oxygen. Then at night they respirate and breathe out carbon dioxide, and especially when they die, consume a lot of oxygen.  They trap nutrients into their decaying matter, and deplete oxygen and carbon dioxide which your roots and fish will need.  It also looks uglier.  But it's not all bad! http://allaboutalgae.com/benefits/"

I have towers over almost all my open water now I just have plecos and other algae eaters to handle any algae. You should do your best to shade it if you can but if thats not an option because of layout or it being out doors algae eaters are an alternative option. Species will depend on tempreture. For cold water go with high fin algae eaters and plecos for warm water. Other great options are garras, cheery shrimp, or saimese algae eaters."

I'd lost about 6 fish but had one left that appeared to be a trooper. Because he was hunky dory, I left the tank continue to run as it was.  About 2 weeks later, my numbers evened out and I now have 15 fish in there as happy as can be.  I'd implement your initial idea and introduce some snails or prawns.

aquaponics,31pgx8,alwaysthevillain,2,Tue Apr 7 03:16:15 2015 UTC,I would go with any 'hardy' fish that would do well naturally in your climate (assuming outdoor growing). I recommend rosy red minnows or goldfish for systems smaller than 50 gallons.   Google 'aqadvisor' and use the dimensions of your fish tank and user defined filter the size of your grow bed to get an idea.  Cleaning the aquarium shouldn't be a huge deal. You might want to setup a system to remove 'solids' and that might require some cleaning as well as a quick scrub of the tank every couple weeks.  I would go with a decent sized system if you really are interested.. because if you enjoy a small system I guarantee you will almost immediately start planning something bigger and better
aquaponics,31pgx8,MilkCurds,2,Tue Apr 7 19:53:53 2015 UTC,"As far as fish, think cheap, hardy fish. Koi, Goldfish, Tilapia (depending on climate). Mosquito fish, I have a few plecostomus in my tank with the other fish bc they keep the sides of the tank liner algae free and they grow very fast/produce a good amount of waste. Where do you live? Climate will be the biggest factor if the system is going to be outside.  As far as cheap to build systems go look into http://www.aces.edu/dept/fisheries/education/documents/barrel-ponics.pdf Barrelponics. Depending on where you live you can probably get some food grade barrels ""donated"" to ya if you find a company that uses them in everyday work, like candy manufacturing place around here gets them full of food dye and sugars, also local car washes will have them for their soap deliveries, the soap can be washed out. But your options are endless and it is possible to do on small budgets, depending how resourceful you are. Basically you need 2 inert, water-tight containers, media and a pump. One container for the fish, the other grow bed with media for bio-filter, pump the fish tank water thru the grow bed and have it drain back into fish tank."

aquaponics,31jkl0,apundit,2,Sun Apr 5 18:39:46 2015 UTC,"It's probably not the substrate, it's likely the biological activity in the substrate lowering your pH. If you have soft water, you should supplement carbonate to help buffer the acidification from nitrification."
aquaponics,31jkl0,Optimoprimo,1 point,Sun Apr 5 18:44:26 2015 UTC,"Hey, thanks very much for your reply. We tried adding bicarbonate of soda but that didn't seem to help either, but we have a few systems running so I'll keep trying with one to see if it helps. I should have mentioned we're still cycling and hadn't recorded any nitrites before the pH issue became apparent.   The substrate was donated from a company that had a failed attempt at aquaponics so it had previously been used and we washed it all before using, but is it likely that there's still residual bacteria and that's the issue?  Thanks again, been struggling with this for a few weeks now!"
aquaponics,31jkl0,Optimoprimo,2,Sun Apr 5 18:50:32 2015 UTC,"Bacteria would only remain if the clay never dried. And that would only help your cycling. During cycling, nitrification is obviously going on like crazy. Even if you hadn't recorded any nitrites, there's still bacterial respiration going on. So it's potentially just overwhelming any buffers you put in there. Are you cycling with fish or without?"
aquaponics,31jkl0,Optimoprimo,1 point,Sun Apr 5 19:06:51 2015 UTC,"Clay was dry when we received it, which is why I thought we wouldn't have an issue with harmful/help from any beneficial residual bacteria. Initially cycled with two goldfish (1600 litre tanks) but they died within a week, I'm assuming due to the low pH. No nitrites or nitrates registering, only moderate ammonia. I tested the substrate in isolation with tap water, and pH dropped from 7.2 to 6.0 or below (our test kit only goes down to 6) overnight once the substrate was added. Do you think adding carbonate will be able to combat it or would we be better starting with new substrate in your opinion? At this stage I'm worried what else the substrate was exposed to when the original owner's attempts failed and it was left dormant for a couple of years."
aquaponics,31jkl0,Spitinthacoola,2,Sun Apr 5 19:14:53 2015 UTC,That's weird. I have the same brand as you and will try your experiment with some of mine. I can't think of anything that might have been deposited in the pores of the clay which would lower pH that dramatically. Some kind of salt that's dissolving and forming an acid in solution. Do you know if you have soft water?
aquaponics,31jkl0,Spitinthacoola,1 point,Sun Apr 5 20:26:24 2015 UTC,"Good to know you have the same brand and don't have an issue with it. Based in west central Scotland which typically has soft water (haven't tested the tap water we've been using specifically), but the tap water itself was reading a pH of 7.2 so it seemed to only become an issue once it was cycled through the substrate. I'll keep going with the carbonate in any case and see if I can get it to stabilise. Worst case I'll get in a fresh batch of substrate; I'd never had an issue before either so maybe it was just a bad batch. Thanks for your help, much appreciated!"
aquaponics,31jkl0,Spitinthacoola,2,Sun Apr 5 20:48:56 2015 UTC,Did you wash the substrate before using it?

aquaponics,31gtxq,CogitoNM,1 point,Sat Apr 4 23:19:33 2015 UTC,A literal description might be better than a 10min video.
aquaponics,31gtxq,CogitoNM,1 point,Sun Apr 5 16:42:43 2015 UTC,"So, 330 Gallon tank, worked by 2 500 or so GPH pumps (due to head height). One pump is on all the time and supplies water back to the tank with aeration by way of a 4 spot venturi rail. The tank is mostly buried in the ground to control water temperature.  The system has 4 Dutch bucket tables, that each will hold 16 buckets, with each bucket containing two larger plants (like tomatoes, hot peppers, etc). The system also has 2 NFT rail tables made with 4"" Schedule 40 PVC, to contain 3"" net pots at approximately 10""-12"" intervals, offset between the rails.  The dutch buckets are intended to contain coarse perlite, the netpots either the hydroton clay stuff or expanded slate."
aquaponics,31gtxq,CogitoNM,2,Sun Apr 5 18:01:37 2015 UTC,"Interesting. You have two pumps, one to cycle the fish tank water back upon itself (and aerate), and the other heads to NFT.   Sounds good though. Expect that you don't seem to have any solids filtration. If you are doing NFT then you have to make 110% sure that you get all solids removed or they will coat the roots of the plants and thwart any nutrient uptake. An inline swirl filter would do this, or some multi-stage Matala filter contraption. Secondly, I don't see any biofiltration set up. Or rather, anything specific for biofiltration, and that's pretty important.   So, ultimately, except for the one pump that just cycles, you are going to have a 500gph pump feeding 4 NFT trays and then dumping back into the fish tank. Seems a mighty long way to pump water, especially because you're needing the one pump to push water through a closed tube, the open NFT tubes, and then back through a closed tube to the fish tank. Seems to me that this system is going to be prone to overflowing or lacking sufficient head pressure to get from the beginning to end. I could be wrong about this though, both my opinion and my conception of your setup could be in error.   For me, it always seems a better choice to pump the water uphill and then let gravity bring it through the plants and then back to the fish tank. I have mine with a 200g sump stock tank pump into my swirl filter which then flows into the two trays and through bell siphons back into the sump. You could utilize something similar in your situation with a swirl filter before your NFT trays, thus eliminating solids, and having gravity do most of the work for you."
aquaponics,31gtxq,CogitoNM,1 point,Sun Apr 5 18:49:19 2015 UTC,"Nice, thanks for the input. Yeah, I am concerned about the points you mentioned. The solids filtration I was hoping at some point to set up a swirl filter. This is just kind of a first crack/Proof of Concept. If I can get something like this working, I'm hoping to build a large green house wrapped, and upscale the system.   With regards to the biofiltration, if the perlite/hydroton doesn't provide enough surface area for the nitrate/nitrite conversions/etc, I'm planning on introducing a couple flat pans behind the NFT rails and just grow like duckweed static as a treat for the fish and a large mat for bacterial growth/filtration.  There's dutch buckets & NFTs though.. I'm not entirely sure how to keep the solids down sans swirl filter, I was thinking about an inline filter in the short term that I could just clean on a regular basis.  For the larger system, I was hoping to introduce fresh water prawns to the bottom of the ""pond"" water source to help break fish waste and food down more. Also, each NFT tray will have it's own supply from the pump, so it should shorten the travel distance by a half. I've already got my eyes on a couple pumps that are 2x and 4x stronger respectively and would just swap right into my system. At that point, the valves I discuss in the video would be used to control the amount of water/water pressure going to the dutch bucket tables so as to not blow up the 1/4 polyethylene fittings.  I'm hoping the system isn't prone to overflowing. I built everything so that the water pumps UP, and then gravity takes care of it from there to return it. I was trying to avoid having to use a sump system, because I'd really like to use the other 250 gallon IBC I've got as a trial of a raft system/breeder tank concept and not have to relegate it or a part of it to sump detail.  Like I said, haven't really done this before, so I want to try as many different systems as I can to see what I like the best, works the best for me, and fits into my upkeep availability schedule the best."
aquaponics,31gtxq,CogitoNM,1 point,Sun Apr 5 18:58:35 2015 UTC,"If you were to have an inline mechanical filter the first time you clean it will unload a whole bunch of solids that will ultimately coat your roots. I would just use your other IBC as a settling chamber / (square) swirl filter, they are especially nice for this because you can drain the bottom (sludge) quite easily when needed. Since you're going the NFT route, it's pretty much required that a swirl filter / settling chamber is used as well. Unless you can find another way of removing solids of course. It's better to do one thing right than two things almost right. Regarding the biofiltration, you are correct that the peralite / whatever pots will work for that, but am I correct that those are going to be on a separate leg of the system? I'm sure that would be essentially sufficient, but I always like my biofilter to be ahead of any splits in the line. That way the water going to the plants will have been 'cleaned' of as much ammonia as possible. Not a huge deal, and your ammonia / nitrate testing might show that the pots are entirely sufficient.   One way I solve this is to either have the water initially pumped into a overflow tray full of lava rock, and/or have the pump stuffed into a milk crate full of lava rock / Springflo. The first works great as a way to show off a neat plant like a Canna, and the latter is nice because it's an initial mechanical filter as well."

I wouldn't recommend using activated carbon, it won't harm the fish but your not going to get a whole lot of benefit from the carbon unless your water just really stinks or something which might signify needed a small water change. The Carbon can actually also absorb some of the beneficial nutrients your system will develop over time as it matures such as phosp. As far as the bio-filter goes, all you need is a medium that the bacteria can grab on to, gravel, is really popular in aquaponics, but it can be all sorts of materials, on some of my hobby fish tanks I have been using these 20 cent pot scrubbing sponges theres a lot of Surface area on the spongers so the bacteria colonize very quickly, I've seen people use orchard netting, weed netting, sand, the list goes on. Find something that has good surface area, won't affect the chemistry of the water and odds are the bacteria will love it! Whatever media you decide to use, just have it in a container that the water of the system passes thru constantly. if you are doing a flood and drain bed, this can be your grow beds and you don't need a dedicated biofilter, if you are doing a DWC or raft style aquaponics than you will probably need to have a biofilter to help keep the fish healthy.

If you fill the pots with an inert media then that should provide good surface area for bacteria growth. Expect the top pots to get loaded with solids, though.

Is removing solids equivalent to removing fertilizer?   The way my system is built solid strings of fish poop build up on the floor of the aquarium and I end up vacuuming them into a mesh bag. I'm cycling my system so I feel like rinsing the bag in the sink is slowing me down, am I better off throwing it in the small sponge filled container I have in my media grow beds?  TLDR: Does an optimal system keep solids for as long as possible to help fertilize the plants?"

People commonly use the term ""fish crap"" to mean all of it and that's technically wrong. You are definitely removing fertilizer by removing the solids. Solids need time to decompose to release their nutrients, however. People accomplish this decomposition in different ways that you can research. While cycling I'd probably keep them in, but once that's done.. if you have a small system and your crops aren't drawing nutrients at capacity, it's not a big deal to just remove them to reduce build up. Monitor your chemistries."

Larvae breathe through spiracles located on their eighth abdominal segments, or through a siphon, so must come to the surface frequently. The larvae spend most of their time feeding on algae, bacteria, and other microbes in the surface microlayer.  They dive below the surface only when disturbed. Larvae swim either through propulsion with their mouth brushes, or by jerky movements of their entire bodies, giving them the common name of ""wigglers"" or ""wrigglers"".

It is also the common name for a member of the genus Planaria within the family Planariidae. Sometimes it also refers to the genus Dugesia.   Planaria are common to many parts of the world, living in both saltwater and freshwater ponds and rivers. Some species are terrestrial and are found under logs, in or on the soil, and on plants in humid areas.  Some planarians exhibit an extraordinary ability to regenerate lost body parts. For example, a planarian split lengthwise or crosswise will regenerate into two separate individuals. Some planarian species have two eye-spots (also known as ocelli) that can detect the intensity of light, while others have several eye-spots. The eye-spots act as photoreceptors and are used to move away from light sources. Planaria have three germ layers (ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm), and are acoelomate (they have a very solid body with no body cavity). They have a single-opening digestive tract; in Tricladida planarians this consists of one anterior branch and two posterior branches.

I'm having a hard time figuring out the mechanism myself, aside from UV energy knocking off electrons, facilitating oxidized molecules, which precipitate."
aquaponics,312mbp,Aquaponics-Heretic,1 point,Thu Apr 2 00:44:13 2015 UTC,"Precipitation in hydro is usually temperature related... within higher range pH...  But yeah it seems to suggest an endothermic reaction... energy transfer..  I saw mention (some where) of Iron Oxide... insoluble ferric oxide.. (basically rust...)  Which would again indicate a definite high alkalinity... and if a redox reaction... must have another half reaction process... electron donor/recipient...  But that scenario doesn't fit neatly in an often acidic AP system... as it would tend more towards a metal swap with things like Calcium, Magnesium, Potassium.. possibly Sodium etc....   Or an anaerobic style denitrification.. which from memory is the order of Nitrates, Iron, Sulphur...  Just spit-balling  over a coffee... rubs chin..."
aquaponics,312mbp,zynix,2,Thu Apr 2 00:59:24 2015 UTC,"I believe /u/PotentPonics and me figured this out a bit ago.    It's actually the iron that is the problem, Fe goes through the UV and becomes Hydrous ferric oxides which then sequesters other elements/molecules.   The secondary effect compounds are super bonded/attracted to each other and without another catalyst will likely stay that way."
aquaponics,312mbp,Optimoprimo,2,Thu Apr 2 18:33:04 2015 UTC,"I just spoke with a biogeochemist in our department and they explained the same thing. UV light further oxidizes by stripping tightly held electrons. Iron precipitates as ferrihydrite. The degree to which any of these ions precipitate is heavily pH dependant, however you don't really want your pH in the 2-5 range where precipitation won't happen."
aquaponics,312mbp,zynix,1 point,Thu Apr 2 18:42:29 2015 UTC,"If you have access to a biochem.  According to my system logs, a solution of acetic acid will temporarily lower pH but then the level will rise back up.  Is the shoft just CO2 being created and then outgassed?"
aquaponics,312mbp,Optimoprimo,1 point,Thu Apr 2 19:03:20 2015 UTC,"Yes, that is more than likely carbonate buffering the water. You need a stronger acid than acetic. Especially if by acetic acid you meant vinegar."
aquaponics,312mbp,zynix,1 point,Thu Apr 2 19:08:09 2015 UTC,"Yeah I've gone through the complete equation for acetic and various carbonate compounds.  Some flavor of phosphoric or HCL will knock pH down and keep it down while acetic by example would shift pH from 7.27.4 to 6.4, only to have pH shift back up to 7.27.3 18 hours later.  Meanwhile ascorbic which is a weaker acid can shift pH from 8.2 to 7.5 and it will stay.  With the exception of HCL, I am talking about a 1:1 ratio ( eg 1 mg/l to 1 mg/l ) of potassium or calcium carbonate to comparable solution.  I've asked a chemistry professor what method of action could cause the pH shift only to have it rise back up, they couldn't think of a reason.   Put another way, what is different between acetic and the other acids that the former only causes an increase of hydronium.  Very high level of the reactions involved:  acetic acid + calcium carbonate forms calcium acetate, h2o, and CO2.   As far as I know the calcium acetate is stable and would remove CaCO3 from the system.  Last thing, at this point I only use phosphoric or nitric acid ( cost to utility ) and occasionally boric acid for my systems but for the most part its not needed as nitrification in my systems keeps the pH low, leaving only the need for potassium bicarbonate to slow down hydronium saturation.  edit: edits to pH values as I actually check my notes."
aquaponics,312mbp,Optimoprimo,1 point,Thu Apr 2 20:55:53 2015 UTC,"If it's anything, I think potentially the formation of salts are encouraged more with acetic acid than the other compounds. Ascorbic acid has an aromatic component, which is happier on it's own than the CH3COO-. Ascorbic acid is great to use because it also dechlorinates. It's also eliminated after a few days, however.  I like phosphoric and nitric because of the ability for the plants to assimilate the byproducts, however I get why hydrochloric and sulphuric are favored."

aquaponics,312mbp,Polyneophite,1 point,Thu Apr 2 07:17:03 2015 UTC,"Yep, it is very specific to pH but Iron generally doesn't want to be soluble anyways and will stop being soluble if you look at it funny for too long or sneeze loudly and scare it.  Basically, I think everyone is right. UV light also kills any bacteria that get near it, a subject kinda neglected in this thread. All the bacteria is good, especially if the system is just getting established. The only good source I could find without resorting to scientific papers was about how UV separates Iron III bound to carbonate and insolubulizes it but it was in powdered form and a shitty source. My guess as someone who has studied iron solubility in a lab is UV will do some harm but hard to say for sure.   If using UV i would supplement a huge amount of supplemented iron and other trace minerals.   Edit: Much better to cover the tank. Much easier."

I'd say you're pretty heavily stocked, but it all depends on how much nitrate your growbed is soaking up.  You'll be able to figure that out yourself with a testing kit.  If your system is fully cycled and your nitrates aren't getting above 5-10 ppm, you could probably stand to add more fish.  If it's high enough to start stressing the fish, (30 ppm or higher consistently), you need to remove some fish or increase the size of your growbed."
aquaponics,310qwz,4of20,6,Wed Apr 1 05:08:27 2015 UTC,"I often run into this idea from the graduate students at my university. They get interested in our aquaculture department, make little setups, and then talk about starting their own business someday. They ask me for advice.   I tell them to think about the time and investment required for any other business, even a small business. If you went to a bank for a loan on any business, showed them your business model, then estimated your startup costs to be $10,000 (a common figure students think will be all they need), you'd get laughed out of their office. $10,000 for almost any startup, unless it's an invention, is on par with opening a large lemon-aid stand. Familiarity with aquaponics is a necessity, passion is a necessity, but it's also critical to familiarize yourself with agribusiness. I think people have this perception that if their AP system is awesome enough, the profits will come. It just doesn't work like that, unfortunately. Very good setups and visionary people have gone down the drain due to their negligence in appreciating their operation as a profit/cost model. Instead they treat it like a bigger version of their backyard hobby. The reality of starting a business in this field is that, just like almost any other business, it requires a significant investment and savvy. Even more compounded is that you're in agriculture, which is a very tricky market. I am a little more optimistic than /u/Aquaponics-Heretic in general, and think you could get by with a bit less than 100k on the minimum. But that will be really scraping by on profit.   Don't give up on this if it's a dream. But please please do much more research beyond a reddit post before you do anything. I'd recommend taking a course, requesting a tour of an area aquaculture facility. Ask questions. You'll learn for yourself what kind of beast you're taking on. I'd check out this website for some resources: http://aquaponics.com/page/commercial-systems  Not saying you should go through them, but it will give you an idea of the cost and scale involved in a profitable farm."
aquaponics,310qwz,Optimoprimo,2,Wed Apr 1 14:57:05 2015 UTC,"Thank you for your well thought out reply, I have the passion, and the dream :D, have had this since I was very young, and I have done a lot of research outside this reddit post, was just putting it here for any insight, especially the insight you have given, I'm not afraid of losing the investment, as I did nothing to get this money, and actually feel a little bad about receiving it :D. I was just hoping to open the door with this, and commercial scale wasn't at all the short term goal, maybe a far future goal, but for now I was looking to supplement income with this, I had read stories of other such small farms doing decent business selling to farmers markets, and high end restaurants, and thought it would be possible for me to do the same, when I think commercial scale I think selling to super markets, chain restaurants, etc. and I wasn't looking to have the aquaculture side of it to be profitable, I was planning to use Koi, and occasionally sell them when they got too big, was hoping to mainly bring the income in through specialty/exotic vegetables. Didn't realize liner systems were so frowned upon, from my research it seems mostly all even large scale ap farms are using liners =/ anyway you've given me a lot more to consider, thanks again for your reply."
aquaponics,310qwz,Optimoprimo,2,Wed Apr 1 17:34:30 2015 UTC,"Just please keep in mind what I'm suggesting isn't what it takes to make a huge living on a commercial scale and be a farming mogul, it's what's necessary to make any money at all. I'd seriously consider thinking about Tilapia. Why give up on that potential profit? You won't make much selling Koi, they come pretty cheap. Also liners are fine, but media beds are a waste of money.   In the end it's your journey, but tread carefully. We aren't telling you it's ""risky,"" we are telling you that from a financial perspective you are better off setting that $10,000 on fire.  I think you could make a great outdoor hobby setup with that and nearly breakeven from selling your products if you raise a marketable fish.

To be fair, you could make a profitable aquaponics setup from this. If its a part time large setup in your yard and you don't have to pay rent or any license, inspections, blah blah and you have a day job."
aquaponics,310qwz,Polyneophite,1 point,Thu Apr 2 07:00:52 2015 UTC,"I do have stable income already, that requires very little of my time, I already own the property I plan to use, here in Texas you are not required any license, or inspections to sell produce that you grew yourself, that is why this seemed like a good idea to me, Since I enjoy it anyway, I thought ""hey why not have my hobby make me some money"" I guess the way I posted it made it seem like I was going change my whole life to try and make a million bucks at farming, thats not the case, but still this thread as done exactly what I wanted it to do, which is give me something else to think about, it didn't net me a checklist of things that are a necessity :D. I just assumed it would be profitable enough to at least make my investment back within 24 months, but I guess I really need to visit a large ap system, and really find out what the operating costs are, it seemed to me that after the initial investment, the day to day costs would be fairly low, seems I might be wrong about that :D"
aquaponics,310qwz,Optimoprimo,2,Thu Apr 2 11:46:20 2015 UTC,"This is beginning to sound like a better plan now. Having the property is really good. No inspections is also good and having a separate income is the best.   Now there is still an issue of scale. Many of the building and production costs do not scale linearly with size, for example the fingerling fish themselves. You pay a lot more per fish for 20 fish then you do for 2000 fish. It also takes about the same amount of time to feed 2000 fish as it does 200 fish.  We can't give you a checklist because it doesn't work that way beyond the basics but I will give it a quick shot anyway.  Space to build  Is anyone going to object that can stop you? (neighbors, city, zoning, etc)  Water source with appropriate grade water (tested)  Reliable power source  Design that has no single point of failure  power backup system  Appropriate filters, at large scale media beds are not nearly as profitable and have much higher labor and materials costs.  Minimal pumping requirements (single pump is best) to reduce ongoing electrical costs  DWC design or NFT design to minimize temperature swings  Backup power sufficient for longest power outage ever experienced +~50% (just what I would do)  Air bubblers for tank(s), filters (depending on design), mineralization tank(s) and DWC  2nd pump system to switch on in case of pump failure.  Source fish, source seeds, source iron and mineral supplements  Fish food. Have to decide what sort of business you want to be. Organic with minimal ocean 'Kill absolutely everything we can catch and put into this pellet' type? Cheaper bulk from china where are are feeding depleted fish stocks to grow your fish? No matter what you do, its not going to be cheap.  Net pots/plant holders for DWC or NFT.  Media for net pots if using.  Composting/disposal options for piles of plant matter.  Disposal plans for when you kill all your fish at some point and they cannot be harvested. (it eventually will happen, if you are really good it will just take some years)  Testing kits and water correction supplies  Pest control and surpression.  Pollonation help   Beneficial insect supply  Design for removing settlement from low points in system  temperature control for water and air   harvesting and planting plan and schedules  Fish quarantine tank  Fish medications and vast amounts of salt  Water top up and level control with pre-treated water.  Disposal of filter sludge if not digested by mineralization tank  AND LASTLY tons of other things I haven't thought of yet. Not saying it can't be done at all but trying to make it a profitable business venture will take some doing. Not relying on it as a source of income frees you some for certain. My own dream plan for an aquaponics greenhouse is to have it attached to my future brewpub. The greenhouse doesn't have to operate at a gain, just not a very large loss. This way if it operates at the same amount of loss as the food costs it is replacing I am breaking even, which is a much easier level to reach. I also think that this smallish (commercial scale) operation will probably cost around $50k-$60k."
aquaponics,310qwz,Aquaponics-Heretic,1 point,Thu Apr 2 18:46:53 2015 UTC,"I think there's been a miscommunication in the entire thread that we are describing to you how to make a million bucks. I'm trying to explain the threshold at which you won't spend more money than you make in the endeavor. A smaller system doesn't make you ""some"" money as opposed to millions, it loses money, because it's impossible to produce as much as it costs to run.  I think looking into your day-to-day expenses is a good idea. Here's a good way to look at it - calculate how much you could optimistically produce in 6 weeks of operation in a system you plan to build with your 10k. Then calculate your operating costs - energy, water, feed, water maintenance (don't underestimate water maintenance cost), seed, fish fry, etc. Then divide that cost over your produce to estimate how much you'll need to sell each pound of produce for. If it comes out to $30-$50 per pound, which I'm thinking it will, you might have a hard time finding anyone to buy that product. And remember this is ignoring your startup cost.  This is an area of interest for me, so as you progress in this please post what you've been up to! Something we research here is how small can you make an operation and keep it profitable. Will Allen used to be interested but he gave up and now depends on grants.

It's important to appreciate the investment and scale required to make an AP farm profitable. 10k doesn't get you close to even a medium-scale aquaculture setup, let alone a hydro addition and a greenhouse. You can't start small and then build as you make money, because you'll never make a profit if you're only producing a couple thousand dollars worth of product every year but spending several thousand in upkeep. An AP system breaks a profit due to the ability to stock densely, bulk your costs, use industrial practices that reduce time and money, and pad the system from failure. These things require a fairly large scale and very particular methods/equipment.  You're on to something by wanting to build a ""badass hobby greenhouse"" and even selling those products to nearly breakeven on your hobby.

I've made it almost a part-time job studying what's involved over the last several months and there is very steep, but not insurmountable learning curve. It's easier for me since my college major is environmental engineering, with a heavy emphasis on water chemisty. An aquaponics system is, essentially, a water treatment plant.  That being said, you also need a basic fluency in aquaculture, horticulture, plumbing/construction, fluid dynamics, and business. So, if you are serious, start knocking it out. Invest time before money. Starting small scale is usually going to entail entering a niche market. How are the local restaurants in your area? Maybe they want a local, sustainable food source they can advertise to customers. I know Texas is in a massive drought, maybe therein lies your opportunity. The business end is the real beast. A system can be designed to suit your needs, those needs will dictate the feasibility. Here's recent tour of an urban setup in Detroit."

And if it's true that some plants require ebb & flow, how do you explain that many plants can still be grown in a DWC system (which is constantly flooded), though with an airstone + airpump to prevent root rot?  Even according to Dr. Wilson Lennard, as long as there is turbulence when the water returns to the fish tank there should be enough oxygen in the system for both the fish and the plants.   According to Dr. Lennard, plants don't take oxygen through the roots. The reason why oxygen must be in the water is precisely to prevent root rot from occuring (and also anaerobic zones). (Check minute number 4 of the video I linked).  In regards to your number 2, I agree that it's a risk, but it's a risk that will be mitigated if you are ensuring enough dissolved oxygen through a return standpipe that creates enough surface turbulence or an extra air pump with an air stone, since a lot of oxygen (aerobic zones) will prevent the creation of an anaerobic zone."
aquaponics,30w8oe,in-site,7,Tue Mar 31 05:16:24 2015 UTC,You can put fresh water clams in your system no problem. They need alot of calcium a min of 3 dKH alkalinity and a regular supply of algae.

aquaponics,30wn6h,triplesixmafia,2,Tue Mar 31 08:42:40 2015 UTC,"Let me first say that I love fish, I have had tanks my entire life and spend way to much time obsessing/maintaining the tanks, 99.99% of the time I would go with ""whatever is better for the fish"" THE ONLY TIME I DISAGREE with ""better for the fish"" is cycling. I KNOW that the cycle is VERY hard on most fish, and will even kill some breeds of fish. I have done fish-in and fish-less cycles on so many tanks its not even funny. I absolutely disagree with fishless cycling, I know that it ""works"" but its just not the same, I don't know what it is but something about a fish-in cycle just makes the whole system more stable and complete. I have had several fish-less cycled tanks that crashed and ""re-cycled"" 6 months due to a minor issue or a to large of a water change, this kind of stuff NEVER happens when I use fish-in cycling. My theory is that it there are some processes in the cycling we skip when we add straight ammonia, if cycled the correct way with fish in you will not kill your fish and if you select the right type of fish it will not show noticeable signs of stress. Again, I want to stress I am all about the health and safety of fish, so you say well fish-in cycling doesn't sound healthy of safe for the fish, you are correct, however not using real fish will ONLY make your tank unhealthy and unsafe for all the future fish you add to it, after the fishes cycle if 8 months down the road you get a case of ick and have to either heat up the water, treat the tank, or do a massive water change, if your tank re-cycles while your fish are already sick/stressed they are going to die and you will probably end up losing the whole tank.  Here is what I recommend doing, get your tank setup, go to petsmart/petco/boxpetstore buy $3-$5 of the 5 cent ""feeder fish"" These minnows/goldfish have been packed like sardines in horrible conditions their whole life, they don't even understand good water chemistry bc they have never experienced it, they add so many fish into those holding tanks for the feeders, theres a HUGE % of the fish that die and just sit in the tank for hours, all of these things cause major water chemistry changes and may not cause the bacteria to die off and tank re-cycle but it is almost never stable. Add these fish to your tank, 85-90% of them will survive the cycle and then at that point you can either let them stay in the tank, or you can get rid of them (feed them to your other fish, give them back to petstore, hell get a young relative a 10G tank and be source of another addicted fish enthusiast!  TLDR had to many ""fish-less"" cycled tanks that ""recycled"" from minor issues within the first year, this never happens on the fish-in cycled tanks and the fish-in cycle tanks biofilters have always been more stable (for me atleast).

Low dKH is also a common issue in AP and a common cause of slow bacteria growth. Anything below a 2 dKH cuts your bacteria colonies ability to replicate IN HALF so why hamstring yourself?  Its one of the biggest most over looked things in aquaponics.
aquaponics,30wn6h,PotentPonics,1 point,Tue Mar 31 14:07:48 2015 UTC,"That's not true... directly...  Such a low dKH indicates virtually no carbonate buffering... hence CO2 production leads to carbonic acid production and declining pH..  Declining pH leads to reduction of nitrification.. because the bacteria need a ""carbon"" source... not a ""carbonate"" as such....  This is why buffering with CaOH, Calium hydroxide is a perfectly reasonable, and commonly utilised RAS practice.. as opposed to a carbonate buffer.... as lifting the ""alkalinity"" in terms of pH reduces the carbonic acid production from CO2, leaving the carbon for nitrifying bacterial reproduction...  Some fish, particularly ornamentals, crustacea and marine corals... benefit from higher levels of ""carbonate hardness""...  But ""carbonate hardness"" and ""alkalinity"" are not the same thing... with regard to nitrifying bacteria...  And NO.. despite the oft repeated assertion by your company principle.... pH decline is NOT  through production of ""nitric acid""... :D"

aquaponics,30wn6h,Optimoprimo,2,Tue Mar 31 17:08:48 2015 UTC,"Low KH  In tanks with a low KH value, say under 2-3d (35.7-53.6ppm), the respiration of the plants or animals at night (CO2 production) can cause large pH shifts which harm and eventually kill aquatic animals. This is called pH shock. It is due to lack of water buffering. KH is consumed by nitrifying bacteria 24/7 so either your substrate generates more, you perform water changes to supplement it or you add chemicals to add KH to your aquarium as otherwise it causes a pH crash/shock. Tip: get up just before the tank lights (or sun light) come on and measure the pH and observe the animals for stress. It may be substantially different than it is during the middle of the day. http://www.theaquariumwiki.com/KH from wiki  It is essential for aquaponics that a certain concentration of KH is present at all times in the water, as it can neutralize the acids created naturally and keep the pH constant. Without adequate KH, the unit could be subjected to rapid pH changes that would have negative impacts on the whole system, especially the fish. However, KH is present in many water sources. Replenishing the unit with water from these sources will also replenish the levels of KH. However, rainwater is low in KH, and in rainfed systems it is helpful to add external sources of carbonate, as explained below.  Right from teh Foa.org which I think is also linked on the side there. http://www.fao.org/3/a-i4021e/i4021e03.pdf  Its one of the most misunderstood aspects of aquaponic chemistry."

aquaponics,30uikz,Kalvynn,3,Mon Mar 30 20:40:04 2015 UTC,"Welcome. Firstly I'd recommend the fao report on the right sidebar for most of the info you'll probably need. You need a pump to run the water over a plant bed. Your hob filter won't cut it. A nice 400gph pump should run you 20ish bucks. Control its flow with a ball valve. You'll also need plumbing; I like the black acrylic pond tubing and pvc. If you don't have a good window, you'll need a growlight. I'd recommend T5 fluorescent lights. They're great for starters. Get a unit big enough to cover every inch of your growing area. If you want a growbed with media, then it should ideally be a foot deep with a grow media. Clay pebbles, river rock, growstones, shale, lava rock are common choices. A raft or nutrient film technique can be cheaper and easier but imo require a tiny bit more know-how. Do some research on it and decide what's best for you. Beyond that it's just setting up the plant bed over your fish tank and circulating the water. It's pretty simple once you get the hang of it."

Then you have to keep them from getting back in your house. You can't use pesticides in the system, but you can use them on doorways and windows to keep them from entering the house at all. Or use natural repellants on the doorways and windows. Either way, I'd say the best thing for you is to keep new ones from getting in your house, then over time you'll have less as you keep eliminating any you see."

aquaponics,30obnh,in-site,1 point,Tue Mar 31 04:21:08 2015 UTC,its best to keep your trees mobile for fruiting reasons. We have ours mounted on platforms with castors so we can wheel them from the greenhouse to a colder building for a month in the beginning of winter and you can get 2 crops in one winter. Most tress que in on temperature not photo period so you need to be able to cool them to induce fruiting unless its a continuous fruiting variety. If you cool them down for 30 - 60 days depending on variety then warm them up they will flower and fruit and you can do it multiple times per year getting much more fruit from your trees.

aquaponics,30obnh,PASSO3058,2,Tue Mar 31 15:02:32 2015 UTC,It is planted in a 55 gallon drum that I plumbed up to be a dual root zone pot. This lets you keep some anchor weight and time release nutrients in the upper part of the root zone and allot the bottom half to get water then dry back out so as not to drown the tree. We have them setup on every other day timers for 60 minutes only every other day.  If you flood most citrus and most other trees more often they tend to die from too much water.  We have a variety of trees that have been growing some for almost 2 years now.

Is it a constant growing setup, where everyone is producing year round, or are there seasons?  Do different units/floors grow different products, and produce is shared throughout?  Is this in a region close to the equator or further north, where heating is an issue to keep plants alive?  How many units are in the  skyscraper, and are they producing food for their own consumption?  Power costs are also a consideration, is there enough renewable energy supplied to offset the costs?  Is it a growbed, DWC, or NFT setup?  Water weighs a ton, literally.  Those better be some strong balconies, unless the fish tanks are inside the main structure."
aquaponics,30m360,Aquaponics-Heretic,1 point,Sat Mar 28 17:28:57 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the good answer! I gotta be frank, i don't have much technical knowledge of Acquaponics. I am starting to learn all this stuff now. Anyway, the skyscraper is supposed to be located in Milan, Italy, but it'll be better to produce all year round, given that the greenhouses are capable of maintining enough heat during winter. The intention would be to sell the produce to local supermarkets, and not only supermarkets specialised in bio foods.  The intention is that produced should be shared throughout and therefore the profits are split equally between all the tenets/farmers.  There will probably also be a large space for photovoltaic panels that will produce electricity for the building, something around  1000 square meters (10,700 sf). The food is destined mainly for commercial output and not for the consumption of the residents. It is possible that the water tanks will be situated inside the structure, therefore diminishing a little the structural loads. Regarding your question about the type of the system: i'm still not able to decide which system is better. I guess it will be the NFT since it's probable that the fish tank will be inside the building. Thanks again for the answer."

aquaponics,30m360,Lerufus,1 point,Sun Mar 29 00:44:02 2015 UTC,"I think the way to do it would be to have the fish tanks be a staple of the lobby. Essentially, have an aquarium on the first floor, so it's the first thing people see when they walk in. Bring the heart of the farm down to street level where people can see it.  Then it's significantly easier to support thousands of gallons of water, the only thing is pumping water to the higher stories. You could also add another tank on the roof, then gravity does a portion of the work and you only need to worry about pumping up to the intermediary tank."

The cost of installation to have a full functioning system on each balcony also may be an expensive way to do it.   As an alternative perhaps u could consider a small fish room on each level or every second level that batches the water with fish nutrients to each balcony. Sort of like a communal fish room, with individual green houses, although to do this you would have to have much more communication around how people are managing their food production.   Have u considered Vermiponics?  This is so much easier in the sense that u dont have fish to manage.  It also means that you could process your food waste and turn it into vegies:) Perhaps even alternate systems - some aquaponics, some vermiponics.   You could have a central (basement perhaps ) in vessel worm farm, where people chuck out their food waste, and then just take back worm juice for their vermiponics (hydroponic system). In this scenario, u could also feed the worms to other systems that are using fish:)   If you want vegies grown also in planter boxs, u can use the worm castings as a fertiliser soil / conditioner.   Nice idea, reminds me of a functional agri - hundertwasser building, that moves past the aethetics of just green buildings to function food buildings.   This wont be an easy build or operational community - but conceptually interesting.  It sounds like your roof space would be better used for aquaponics, and some how attach the solar panels to the outside of the building, as like awnings for the balconies, depending on your aspect.   Even if you had a tower of solar panels on your southern boundary of the building with the solar panels installed, then you would free up the sun for hydroponics production. Although of course you would have more expense in  construction of the solar power.   Be great to see your final designs:)"

aquaponics,30kh8y,hoodectomy,2,Sat Mar 28 03:54:03 2015 UTC,"I think this depends on a lot of factors really. As a general recommendation I would say go with the box. I've had success with my small systems this way.  Now to the specifics... if your beds are being drained with a siphon or something similar air is being drawn into the root zone naturally, which is important. Systems like constant flood and raft require more aeration because they are constantly flooded with water that your fish are depleting of oxygen. Another thing to mention is that some people create aeration with water flow. If you are creating disturbances at the water surface with falling water that will naturally aerate to some degree. Lastly but probably most obviously would be to consider your stocking density.  But again.. go with the box. Pumps are usually cheap and cheap to run at the lower end. If you see fish gulping for air at the surface or staying near the air output (this might be pseudoscience) you might want to consider more aeration."

aquaponics,30kh8y,Hesh138,0,Tue Mar 31 16:39:17 2015 UTC,"You may not want to use air stones on your pump. Air stones are more for decorative use. The way water absorbs oxygen is through surface movement, not from the bubbles themselves. When the bubbles break the surface of the water it makes the surface ripple, thus making it so oxygen is absorbed. Not using an air stone means bigger bubbles and bigger ripples on the water's surface. The ultimate goal is good water circulation and lots of surface agitation, be it by air pumps, water flow into the tank, etc..."
aquaponics,30kh8y,overkill,6,Sat Mar 28 06:09:20 2015 UTC,My understanding of this was that smaller bubbles increased the surface area across which the oxygen can be absorbed on the way to the surface.

Just have your growbed/nutrient film tray as low above your aquarium as possible. The growbed should drain into your tank, then the canister will pump water back up. All questions are welcome. Aquaponics is simple. You are running fish water over plant roots. That's it. There are lots of details, but always keep that in mind when it seems like a lot to learn. Just care for your aquarium fish like you always would and they have no reason to die.   Edit: I just looked up your UV sterilizer. While most sterilizers aren't good enough to oxidize negative ions, some are and that could be a problem for you. This is bad in aquaponics because you are using those ions as plant food.

aquaponics,30jl9h,Spitinthacoola,1 point,Fri Mar 27 23:41:41 2015 UTC,"Allows you to grow up to 14 plants per 5 feet which is alot more any than vertical tower. It allows easy removal and replacement at any time of any plant so harvest and replant at any time, and is extremely easy to use. You can also use any media type you chose.

aquaponics,30jl9h,Spitinthacoola,2,Sat Mar 28 00:40:26 2015 UTC,"Tbh 14 plants per 5ft2 isn't that impressive, pyramids have more plant sites per square food and there are at least 3 other towers I know of that have 28 or more plant sites per 5ft2 and have a reservoir.

aquaponics,30jl9h,Aquaponics-Heretic,1 point,Sat Mar 28 02:48:32 2015 UTC,These don't clog because there is always a path for both water and roots thanks to a lack of matrix media. Also lets you transplant or harvest one at a time instead of all at once or strip and replant the entire tower MUCH faster than any other option out there. Much better option for commercial application as well due to the higher plant counts than other options.

aquaponics,30jl9h,Spitinthacoola,1 point,Sat Mar 28 11:35:16 2015 UTC,"Its faster because if your harvesting the whole tower all you have to do is harvest your crop pull off the locking ring and the roots and bags fall right out the bottom. Then you simply invert them dumping the old media and roots pull off any left over roots and replant. Takes very little time at all I can strip a tower in under 30 seconds and replant in under 2 minutes. Also because they are bagged it air prunes the roots for the most part and keeps the path clear for water preventing clogs and water from getting to the plant leaves. You can use anything from compostable media to traditional grow media. We have tried papertowels, cardboard, perelite, sponges, soil, coir, biochar, clay media, rockwood, new rags, a t shirt and all worked almost equally well as grow media for lettuce.

aquaponics,30jl9h,Spitinthacoola,1 point,Sat Mar 28 08:56:58 2015 UTC,Sure we have tested under all lighting types aside from plasma which IDK if I have ever seen an an aquaponic system. We currrently have sets of towers being lit from above with LED and induction which do great. We also have some being lit by T5 and by hallide that are mounted horizontally infront of the towers and those do great as well. I have 2 3 foot towers for my kitchen herbs at home with a 20 gallon aquarium under them in my kitchen window. We have also tested these in the greenhouse with amazing results. We have been testing these for almost a year.   As far as yield all yields have been the same or slightly above lettuce grown in a raft and in a media bed as a control.   We also have a larger diameter tower coming next week for tomatoes cucumbers and other larger plants that take up too much room in a normal growbed.
aquaponics,30jl9h,basilikum11,1 point,Sat Mar 28 13:50:55 2015 UTC,I have yet to see any tower perform better than poorly being lit from above. I could see a greenhouse helping but without fail the top plants shade out the bottom plants and bottom plants tend not to develop fully (coloration etc). How does your tower overcome this?  What were the yields in your raft/media bed and towers respectively? I'm used to using metric but if you give imperial that's fine too.
aquaponics,30jl9h,Aquaponics-Heretic,2,Sat Mar 28 16:41:53 2015 UTC,Ah with induction and LEDS you can easily cover 5 vertical feet with out issue. In a greehouse its just about how close you space them from one row to the next.   I will see if I can post specific data we usually keep hard number in house for obvious reasons.

aquaponics,30jl9h,Aquaponics-Heretic,1 point,Sat Mar 28 10:08:30 2015 UTC,"Sure. First is that the plant site per square foot isn't actually thay great. Pyramid structures seem to be the most efficient. Because of the way most towers are designed, they obviously cannot be lit from above without causing the bottom plants to become shaded out. In a greenhouse it doesn't matter so much but if you're doing it indoor it does. If you have a bunch plumbed together in a recirculating system it helps to reduce maintanence costs, but many don't easily come that way and some are designed so that even if you plumb them together they start to leak. Some are designed to hold water at each level, which is fine, except the reservoir at the bottom isn't big enough to hold all of the water being stored above, so if each piece were to fully empty into the reservoir it would overflow. For some, roots tend to get stuck and gum up the internal plumbing mechanisms which are overly complicated and rely on there being a very small margin of flow rate to work correctly (too slow and they don't fill properly, too fast and they overflow ). Most of the tower designs I've seen leak nutrient solution from the gaps between the pieces, others have no gaps but must be harvested fully. A lot of tower try to sell you their own proprietary net pots thay fit in their towers which can be overly difficult to remove and prone to breakage. Often plant sites will be too close together. Some tower emitters tend to get clogged when used with organic nutrients or aquaponics. Harvesting is not usually so bad, but it's no better than horizontal systems. And they all tend to be a pain in the ass to clean properly.   If I think of something else I'll edit but those are the design flaws I can think of off the top of my head."

Pyramid structure does sound like an exploration worthy idea, but first I will make my own experiences with towers.

aquaponics,30fbnl,MilkCurds,1 point,Thu Mar 26 22:17:19 2015 UTC,That works.. however the simple solution is to just not have that inlet tube sitting at the bottom of the tank. Have the mouth of it hanging over and pouring the water in. That way it can't siphon back at all.
aquaponics,30fbnl,Optimoprimo,1 point,Thu Mar 26 22:56:06 2015 UTC,Right. I thought that initially but worried about having too calm of a floor in the aquarium. My outflow is up top so my thinking was to have the clean water flow in low and out high? Not sure how much merit that has though. Thanks for your help (again).  Edit: It also provides weight to hold in place vs. the propulsion of the flow haha
aquaponics,30fbnl,Optimoprimo,1 point,Thu Mar 26 23:10:12 2015 UTC,Shouldn't matter. Without gravel stuff gets kicked up easily. If it's a big concern of yours you can also add an extension to your overflow so it draws from the bottom.

aquaponics,30drg9,PotentPonics,1 point,Tue Mar 31 05:31:06 2015 UTC,Bioballs and biomedia are pointless in an aquaponic system because your grow media takes its place. You have WAY WAY more surface area in your growbed then you ever realistically need to handle your water volume in an aquaponic system so adding bio balls or biomedia is pointless because your adding less than an addition 1% surface area over all to your system which chemically is pointless and not adding enough surface area to actually do anything.
aquaponics,30drg9,Optimoprimo,3,Thu Mar 26 17:47:17 2015 UTC,He never said he has grow media.
aquaponics,30drg9,PotentPonics,1 point,Thu Mar 26 19:06:44 2015 UTC,if your using rafts your surface of your media and your roots serve this function. AT MOST even on a tiny system your adding 2  or 3 % total surface area again way to small to change much of anything. Technically it is doing SOMETHING but its so small your wont be able to measure. Bioballs are only for denitrification in aquariums in aquaponics we have plants for that and don't need to rely on water changes and physical export the same way an aquarium would. The only thing the bioballs will do is build up solids and slow down water movement making anerobic areas more likely in an AP system.
aquaponics,30drg9,PotentPonics,2,Thu Mar 26 19:13:45 2015 UTC,"He could also be running NFT, which does require it. Or just wants it as a backup in case he needs to do work on the planting component of the system. But whatever."
aquaponics,30drg9,Aquaponics-Heretic,2,Thu Mar 26 19:19:33 2015 UTC,"OK, I knew this thread would pop up, but I wanted to wait a few weeks before I posted my entire system with all the specifics...    I agree, compared with grow media, the BSA of any bioball is going to be put to shame. However, in my system, the full flow of water from two rearing tanks flows into a sedimentation tank.  To dial-in the bell siphons of the two subsequent grow beds, I had to reduce the flow from the sed tank by about 30%. Thus, the overflow drain is constantly moving a portion of solution that hasn't had the opportunity to meet any bacteria straight to the sump, although it is somewhat free of solids. I need the sump to make up the difference."
aquaponics,30drg9,PotentPonics,2,Thu Mar 26 20:12:18 2015 UTC,Its not going to do much. Your still covering most of your water volume theres no need to worry about that little bit.
aquaponics,30drg9,Aquaponics-Heretic,1 point,Thu Mar 26 20:26:19 2015 UTC,I would disagree but this ones much more debatable. I have plenty of NFTs that have been going for years with only an aquarium for a res and they all do great. The biolballs thing is just another myth from the RAFT system only crowd. They don't realize there's far more surface area on the root themselves then there ever is with bioballs or bioribbon or any of the other questionably usefully of the same manor. Unless you have a really high amount of them IE 50% of your not going to get a huge benefit when compared to the total system volume. Its super easy to test at home :) Just add a bucket with bioballs to your existing system. It will do little to nothing other than act as a solids separator. If you insist on using it I would go with lava rock over bioballs if only because you get some trace minerals and WAY better surface area. On that token growstones work well too but they float like bioballs. To each his own but unless you get into crazy amounts of bioballs a handful is going to have no readable effect on the water chemistry.If you have a media bed (most peoples setups have at least one) You have 10 - 20 x the surface area in that bed than any bag of bioballs. Its not that it doesn't do anything its just that its so small its not worth the money or effort.

Likewise there is a definitive need for biofiltration/nitrification...

The roots themselves don't perform any measurable degree of nitrification... the energy and oxygen requirements to do so would just totally negate growth...  Perhaps you could enlighten us all as to the basis of the UVI raft system... and why they don't just use the raft plant roots to perform nitrification....

I have seen plenty of large raft systems with no or little biomedia here in the US that do just splendid. I am not disputing that there isn't some benefit but its very small because your not adding that much to the total surface area of the over all system.  This benefit becomes less the bigger you get unless you also scale the media chamber to very very large scale. I use media in most of my systems but I do have a few rafts for greens.

Media beds work great for flowering plants even in commercial. Especially when it comes to cannabis, fruit trees, or anything else with high or specific nutrient requirements. You get WAY more control over nutrients in a media bed than you ever could in a raft. You also can not beat the gas exchange compared to DWC. This is why aero ponics / flood and drain is almost always the fastest growing method in terms of pure speed of growth your far better with air available to the roots. The great thing about flood and drain is that it exchanges the air out in the root system with fresh air. Properly maintained media beds with appropriate worms and prefilter depending on stocking density wont slow over time unless your growing trees or something else over a very long time. I haven't touched my flow rates in 2 years maybe? on my main beds at home. If you have to many fish for sure but its all about how you maintain your system.   Just think bioballs are waste of money unless your doing something extremely small in aquaponics. For cichlid tanks and fish only salt tank tho."

You can use this same method to make any fruiting plant yield WAY higher. Our tomatoe tests alone showed a 30% - 40% yield increase in flowering depending on variety. The other HUGE benefit to adding a soil layer is disease resistance. In our lab testing tomatoes grown in dual root zone pots were WAY more resistant to powdery mildew than tomatoes planted in media beds directly. The presence of soil microbes helps keep the plants immune system in tip top shape. Its not just for cannabis its for any flowering aquaponic plant.

Nothing comes remotely close to the level of control you can get with dual root zoneing. This is why we growing cannabis successfully and full size fruit trees of all kinds and any thing else high nutrient requirement when no one else is. The ability to boost key nutrients on a per plant basis is WAY more control than having to balance your water. With dual root zoneing you get most of your nutrients like any other aquaponic system but you also can boost anything you'd like as needed or as the plant requires.  If you want to learn more on dual root zoneing look up the man who has worked with it the most his name is vlad from atria aqua gardens. He has put out alot of additional information on both the microbiolical benefits of housing both terrestrial and aquatic bacteria in a plants root zone vs just aquatic bacteria and very little mycorrhizae in a traditional AP system. Less conventional for sure but BY FAR the best for both control and plant output. By using dual root zoneing or wicking beds you can grow brutally hard to grow herbs like osho or other plants with extreme mycorrhizae requirements in a normal AP system.

Its why you never see food born illness outbreaks and why you don't have root rot in aquaponics. There is to many other microbes to compete with the baddies.

I don't have a bubble stone running, should I get one before I start or will the movement of the water be enough O2?  What media do you use for the plants? Will  Dorset pea gravel be fine or do you recommend something else?   Thanks again for taking the time to reply, I appreciate it."
aquaponics,308vbo,Sycosys,5,Wed Mar 25 14:53:19 2015 UTC,"I used Granite pea gravel for the first attempt, it was cheap and available. I now use a combo of expanded shale and Hydroton clay pebbles. Before you use the Dorset pea gravel make sure it is ph neutral.   I added an airstone recently to my setup since I had the extra pump laying around, it ran rather nicely without it, and the water movement did seem to be enough. The key really is turning over the water and getting as much gas exchange as possible.   You could simply divert your outflow into a bed and drain it back into the tank. No joke it can be that simple. If you are going for a constant fill (hell even if you aren't) you might want to consider planting in pots. One nice thing about AP is that nutrient availability is not a problem so plants don't need huge spread out root systems. The plants can have tightly packed rootballs and do perfectly fine since the nutrients go to the roots. You can put plants in pots which fit your grow bed, which cuts down on expensive fillers like Hydroton. This also allows you to move them around and occasionally take them out if needed. This is good from experience, plants grow, change shape etc.. Being able to move them and remove them to another grow bed easily is a nice perk. Another thing is cleaning up a pot of grow media and roots is far easier than cleaning out a whole growbed."
aquaponics,308vbo,finnerpeace,3,Wed Mar 25 15:07:43 2015 UTC,"So, I too both have a planted tank and garden and of course am interested in putting my basil etc indoors. However, it's REALLY not worth the risk of breakage and water spill with a pump in my mind/house/marriage.  Did you ever try just hanging your plants in pots with grow media IN the tank, with an overhead lighting system? I'm wondering why not just try that, and why a separate grow bed would be needed for small scale plantings..."
aquaponics,308vbo,Sycosys,2,Wed Mar 25 15:49:06 2015 UTC,"I thought this at first as a simpler setup, but I thought of a couple of snags for my circumstances that make this good idea a bit more complicated.  Firstly the aquarium is already set up and the hood containing the lighting would need to be rigged up to sit higher. I don't have the engineering skills to somehow do this, other than drilling brackets into the wall above the tank to place the lid on.  Secondly I think the fish would nibble on the roots, probably killing the plants or being detrimental to their health (the plants & the fish...)  That's why I was going the pump way."
aquaponics,308vbo,finnerpeace,2,Wed Mar 25 16:04:10 2015 UTC,I have a nice little vine growing out of the filter on my ten gallon tank.. It seems happy. Essentially that is a plant just hanging in the water. The only minor issue I see with this is that you would definitely need an airstone or sufficient pump power to circulate water and ensure maximum oxygenation
aquaponics,308vbo,Sycosys,3,Wed Mar 25 15:55:33 2015 UTC,"It seems pretty standard for established aquarists to waaayyy overfilter/understock/heavily plant their tanks. I have 100 gallons of filtration running on a 40 gal tank, that is moderately planted and only filled about half ""recommended"" stocking capacity, and this seems par for the course in my aquarium club. We tend to just seek the easy maintenance route and decide to overfilter+plant generously+understock.  I know I'd need an O2 meter to really tell, but I'm suspecting that in this type of common setup there may already be more than enough O2, and in fact low CO2 may be an issue."
aquaponics,308vbo,boberticus,3,Wed Mar 25 16:16:26 2015 UTC,There is no such thing as overfiltering your water!! Blasphemer!!  In all seriousness you are probably right about your levels in a standard aquarist setup.  It has become force of habit to remind people in this sub that circulation and oxygenation are not a bad thing.
aquaponics,308vbo,Reaper666,1 point,Wed Mar 25 16:21:22 2015 UTC,"I've always understood that Co2 is absorbed much more easily from the air than from the water. Should I be adding Co2 to my system for the emersed plants, or are you talking about the plants that are submerged running out of C02?   Edit: I reread your comment and you don't talk about above water plants sorry my bad, your absolutely right about the C02."
aquaponics,308vbo,Sycosys,3,Wed Mar 25 18:31:55 2015 UTC,"Thanks man, it's great to have a good answer from a person instead of having to research everything. I really appreciate you getting back to me.   I think I'll copy your shale and Hydroton. A quick Google shows Dorset pea gravel raises PH in a lot of aquariums.   If you don't mind my asking even more - How deep is your growbed  for tomatoes; I assume they are cherry tomatoes and spring onions you're growing?  Actually if the plants are potted I guess it doesn’t need to be very deep at all, just a couple of inches of water running past the roots?   I was going to go for a simple herb garden of basil etc but if tomatoes are on the cards I'll definitely want to give that a go instead.  So, I divert my outflow to a growbed with potted plants in shale and Hydroton pebbles, with their roots just touching the water level, maybe using a mesh to keep the 'neck' above water. Get the water to flow back into the aquarium, and that’s it.  Have I missed anything major? Seems like my Saturday morning is sorted."
aquaponics,308vbo,Optimoprimo,2,Wed Mar 25 15:53:24 2015 UTC,"Water leaving the filter is typically devoid of oxygen, as the latter part of most filtration setups is the anaerobic stage. Be certain to run the water over a little waterfall or a ton of bubble surface area to get the O2 back up to par."
aquaponics,308vbo,Sycosys,1 point,Wed Mar 25 15:58:51 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the input, I hadn't thought of that. I guess fitting a suspended spray bar to the outflow would work? But I'll see if I can implement a waterfall somewhere. This is getting really interesting."
aquaponics,308vbo,Reaper666,2,Wed Mar 25 16:27:23 2015 UTC,I think Reaper666 is thinking of an anaerobic Nitrate Digester.. not the same as a standard inline canister filter
aquaponics,308vbo,Sycosys,1 point,Wed Mar 25 18:29:00 2015 UTC,"I've run canister filters forever and I don't agree with this. The water doesn't degas and has a resident time of seconds in the canister. Most canisters are specifically designed to prevent anaerobic zones when clean. While I will acknowledge there are tons of bacteria in there that will consume O2, I wouldn't say it gets so low as to call it anaerobic. Just the trip out of the plumbing should be plenty exposure to air. Not saying a waterfall or something would hurt, it's just not necessary."
aquaponics,308vbo,Sycosys,0,Wed Mar 25 18:56:34 2015 UTC,"I had not come across this information before, do you happen to remember where you picked it up? I would like to investigate"

aquaponics,308vbo,GrandmaFuxAlot,1 point,Wed Mar 25 17:41:36 2015 UTC,"That is an anaerobic nitrate digester, not an inline canister  filter.. a standard filter does not break down nitrate.. rather creates in an a very aerobic way. Oxygen levels might be slightly less on the out side of a standard inline filter as the nitrifying bacteria do use some converting ammonia to nitrite to nitrate.   Nitrate is plant food and you wouldnt want to convert that in an anaerobic digester to Nitrogen gas in an ap system.    Those digesters are for very specific high end applications well outside the typical aquarium/aquaponics setup.    Within the aquarium, fish and uneaten food produce waste which breaks down to form AMMONIA (NH4). Aerobic bacteria within the filtration system of the tank then oxidise the ammonia first to NITRITE (NO2) and then further to NITRATE (NO3). This series of processes is continuous and ultimately leads to a build up of nitrate in the aquarium which can only be reduced without a nitrate filter by either large regular water changes, heavy aquatic planting or by a reductive process whereby the oxygen from the nitrate molecules is utilised by anaerobic bacteria to convert it to NITROGEN GAS (N2)."
aquaponics,308vbo,Optimoprimo,2,Wed Mar 25 17:51:16 2015 UTC,"My tomatoes are Beefsteak and Heirloom, Onions are Green Onions (big bastards).  These are all grown in my greenhouse, sorry if I implied they were part of my indoor AP system. I currently only grow cannabis in my indoor AP system (Colorado Legalization is nice)  the tomatoes are grown in two different setups, the beefsteak are done in a constant fill bed with a big pot ~38L. So are the Green Onions. This bed runs anywhere from 95% full to 50% full depending on how much gunk is clogging the prefilter.   The Heirlooms are in a fill/drain in ~ 10L pot.   However you grow you will want as much root touching the flowing water as possible, an ideal would be a small clamp which held a plant in the right place and grew with the plant, if you end up doing NFT there are options that achieve this.     For a constant fill bed you would want it to be as full as you are comfortable with and have your plants roots almost completely submerged in the system. (Those pots which are like a rigid plastic mesh are ideal for constant fill)"

aquaponics,3098zd,Optimoprimo,1 point,Wed Mar 25 15:12:22 2015 UTC,Not sure about the nutrient release but I do know rotting plant matter will release tannins.

aquaponics,307ddc,jerry_03,2,Wed Mar 25 01:40:41 2015 UTC,"Hello, if the bell syphons are giving you too much trouble, you can setup a constant flood system, if you have good aeration it works as good as the F & D system...   The mechanism its the same, a standpipe 2"" or 1"" shorter than your mediabed surface... you just remove the bell and you have now a constant flood system!.  About the seeds, i suggest starting them outside (The ziploc bag works great for me) and putting the starts in the growbed when they are big enough, if you set the water level at 1"" inch fromt he surface, they should get enough water without drowning them.  I have a tank with 90 gal and currently have around 15 tilapia, its a little bit crowded, i would sugest around 4 .- 8 fish to your tank depending of your growbed area, plants and other variables. The best feed for Tilapia its a feed design to their metabolism, purina Aquamax its the best you can get IMO."
aquaponics,307ddc,limowrecks,1 point,Wed Mar 25 04:03:13 2015 UTC,You want the water to fill up to about an inch below the level of your media. Set your stand pipe so it will fill that high before draining.  You usually do ~1 fish for every 5-10 gallons of water. I'd go on the lower stocking end of that rule. There are commercial foods most people use. You also feed differently depending on the life stage. There's lots of information in the FAO AP Report on the sidebar to the right that can help you with that.
aquaponics,307ddc,Optimoprimo,1 point,Wed Mar 25 03:05:33 2015 UTC,Isn't stocking based off of filtration? And then there should at least be a 1:1 ratio of grow bed to fish tank?  It looks like the fish tank in the picture is filled to about the same volume as the grow beds. You might want a stronger pump or better yet just get a second one of similar power and run the pumps individually to each bed (if one pump fails you will still run at half capacity).  Good luck
aquaponics,307ddc,MilkCurds,2,Wed Mar 25 04:20:01 2015 UTC,"Yes stocking rates are, or should be based on filtration capacity...  It's suggested that a 1:1 ratio is a ""rule of thumb"" for a balanced system...  But it's not compulsory... you can have less grow bed (hence filtration) capacity... as long as you stock to the actual filtration capacity..."
aquaponics,307ddc,Aquaponics-Heretic,1 point,Wed Mar 25 06:01:10 2015 UTC,"Yes yes all that is true. Trying to help this new person with approximate information is all. As I mentioned, more details are found in that FAO report. His growbeds are small, which is why I suggested the low end of that rough rule. In the end it's a matter of monitoring chemistries, not following some magic rule. Two pumps is asinine imo. If you're having flow rate problems, then just get a bigger pump. Why run extra electricity and have two pumps running at different rates in a small system? Blech. 185GPH is low but should be fine since it's a short trip to the beds :)"
aquaponics,307ddc,Optimoprimo,2,Wed Mar 25 13:47:25 2015 UTC,All good! Wasn't meant as a challenge at all. Guidelines are guidelines after all.  Good point about the pumps. I assume dealing with less wires is optimal too. Something to ponder.

Plants can be grown with the use of artificial light, sunlight, or a combination of the two. Due to the heat generated by high power lamps, grow rooms will often become excessively hot relative to the temperature range ideal for plant growth, often necessitating the use of a supplemental ventilation fan.

A few questions if you don't mind.   What was your harvest like for the first year compared to a in ground garden? How many months did you extend your growing season? Since the pictures only show your solar water heater in the greenhouse is that where you kept it year round? Did you ever stop maintaining the greenhouse? (lighting the furnace, checking the water, etc). Is your greenhouse 100% off the grid or did you have any electrical ran (extension cords) for heat, light, pumps, etc? You mentioned tilapia mixed with your goldfish. How did they fare? Did you get to eat them? How long did they last in the pond? Was keeping the water temp up high enough an issue?   Again what a great job!!!"
aquaponics,3014xt,peschelnet,4,Mon Mar 23 22:47:48 2015 UTC,"The harvests were consistently mind blowing.. I was throwing away herbs weekly (compost pile), we couldnt eat all the tomatoes and peppers and ended up making 3 big mason jars of salsa and 6 mason jars of spaghetti sauce. It was quite amazing.    we had Fresh produce and herbs until early November. Growing season seems to follow the sun.. So november-january are really slow with only the hardiest of plants slowly getting bigger. By Feb plants are already starting to really perk up and add bulk. Typical Colorado Growing season is late April- late september/early October. I planted tomatoes in the greenhouse at the beginning of March  and expect to be harvesting by end of may-end of october.   I didnt worry about heating it unless it was going to be below about 20 degrees outside. A minimal electric heater could keep it above 32 without any intervention on my part and only a modest increase in electric bill.. For the colder periods I would light the fire and heat everything up in the thermal mass properly, which would keep it 35+ even down to temps as low as -14. Next winter i have plans for a far more efficent setup utilizing less labor. I am going to build a smaller rocket stove to heat water to store and release heat into the greenhouse and it will burn pellets or a possible few other methods.   It is definitely not off the grid.. I have fans, some led lights an the pump.  I took the water heater out during the later spring-early fall. It has been in the greenhouse since about October and I will take it out again by mid april at the latest.   The tilapia did great until the water got below about 48. I saved a few in my indoor AP setup and harvested the rest.. one short growing season was not enough to really make them fillet worthy. Ill be sticking with Goldfish, Snails, Worms and the Bullfrog from now on."

Solar water heater and ~1000 gallons of ""warm"" water does wonders for maintaining temp.  The rocket stove was amazing during the really cold snaps. I was able to heat a large mass of dirt (~2 tons) quite a bit by routing the exhaust heat through it in ducts.

So if you find your fish are getting fin rot or other such infections, this is a lifesaver.   However, one added bonus is that it drugs the fish up good. We use it when we don't have bag buddies and the fish have to go on a trip. It reduces stress from catching and movement wonderfully. It also is great to add to the pond at night if you just want to see the fish up close. For whatever reason, if you add some of this to the water at night and put a small clip lamp on the pond, the fish will school and just stare at it. We use it all the time for Koi viewing at night.   The only issue is that you'd probably want to take your garden bed out of the cycle while you have this stuff in the water and you probably don't want the antibiotic properties wrecking havoc on your grow bed. After an hour at most it will have pretty much dissipated.  EDIT: Comment isn't in wrong thread. Just a suggestion that by doping the fish up they're easier to catch. We use this all the time to transport Koi so they don't get bothered by stress and such."

Some of the stuff my acquaintances use are worth hundreds of $'s and cost around one dollar per sample.   API master kit goes for 20-30 and most samples are a penny a test.  additionally  API KH test is good to have.  finally you have to read the UN FAO book on aquaponics and if you can afford it, Sylvia Bernstein's book is a good introduction/topical for ap.  edit, on mobile so best I could do is link to a fellow /r/AP members blog https://www.frostyfish.com/2014/12/24/review-united-nations-aquaponics-manual/  The book he reviews is one of the defacto manuals for AP and was written for the sole purpose of teaching people to use AP to survive."

At least that's what the State Agriculture guy told me when I was looking into it. He also said that if you made your system 100% contained, so there was no chance of the Tilapia entering any streams or waterways, there was no problem with growing them here in the state.   I was going to, but didn't due to having no money to throw at the project. Now I'm back in ABQ and am thinking of getting my indoor system up and running with Tilapia."

aquaponics,2zqaoe,networking_noob,6,Fri Mar 20 19:10:17 2015 UTC,"Think of it this way: you are starting an aquarium, regardless of plants. Nutrients are going accumulate in that water, and the fish can tolerate them to a point. Normally you do water changes to remove the nutrient overload. Plants remove some of that for you instead. It's not complicated and no calculations are needed for it to work. If you aren't developing a high investment system, that's really all you need to care about. If after growing some plants you notice that your nitrates are too high or too low, you can add or remove plants. Or fish. Or do water changes. Just keep a happy aquarium and your fish won't die just because you added a plant. Monitor your chemistries, and take advantage of whats already in the water to grow the plants."

aquaponics,2zoovm,nillotampoco,3,Fri Mar 20 19:10:00 2015 UTC,In a pure DWC system you'll need a seperate biofilter to provide a habitat for the bacteria. It can be a bucket filled with sponges or plastic mesh or some other method of creating a large surface area in a small volume.  In pure DWC (or NFT) you'd also need several solids filters to remove / minimise the amount of solid fish waste that would intefere with the rest of the system.  A lot of domestic setups use a mixed media bed + DWC system and the media bed acts as the biofilter.
aquaponics,2zoovm,denjin,1 point,Fri Mar 20 11:05:34 2015 UTC,"question 2: Is it possible to integrate DWC with E&F by placing a waterpermeable layer in between?   http://i.imgur.com/j5dOtm8.png  In that way it would combine a form of DWC into an E&F system, saving on the amount of media needed.   Question 3: does this decrease the living space for the microbes to0 much??"
aquaponics,2zoovm,Optimoprimo,1 point,Fri Mar 20 13:44:05 2015 UTC,"Having a smashed together version of both is going to leave your plant roots hanging in mid air when the tub drains. They're going to grow below the ""water-permeable layer."" Why drain it at all? If you're trying to use less media, then just skip the media bed all together and put small amounts into the net cups with your plants in a DWC setup. Or do NFT. If you aren't going full media bed, you need a biofilter to provide surface area for bacteria to grow. There's no way around that."
aquaponics,2zoovm,Pastelitomaracucho,1 point,Fri Mar 20 14:16:25 2015 UTC,"Short answer: EVERYWHERE. In surfaces, in the water, inside the piping, inside the fish. There is no place where they do not thrive."

Arguably the best compromise between price and quality at small scales    Steel tanks can work but you have to line them with plastic. At the price you are looking, that poly tank looks really good value.   I would recommend, if you have the space, to go fo a round tank.

GMO  is basically just ""modifying"" an organism to put additional features into it. One research modified goats to produce spider silk in their milk for mass production; See http://phys.org/news194539934.html  Now in crops and plants, these can help to produce more than what they can normally produce, add resistance to pests (eliminating pesticides) and so much more. So basically, there's nothing to compare with Traditional crops vs GMO crops, because you yourself can grow a GMO crop just outside your backyard and then you can call it traditional farming.   Please read more about GMO, because what people thinks about GMO is basically wrong. Maybe Monsanto is doing it wrong, but as GMO in general is different. My girlfriend worked on a GMO crop project capable of resting pests and will help farmers produce more without even applying pesticides (basically reducing production cost). But they got shut down by GreenPeace (PS; I call them GreenPieceOfS***t.

I have heard there are some issues with root plants (onions) in aquaponics. Mostly because the media used doesn't pressurize the root like soil would. Another issue would be that your fish production would be either slow or cyclical in nature compared to produce.  However, these are only hurdles that an innovative mind can conquer I'm sure. Good luck with your system.  I would recommend using 55 gallon barrels or an IBC tote or two.

I don't feel like I have as much ability to do that with a loop setup. It's also a matter of whether you'd like to drain from the bottom or the side. I feel like solids are more likely to settle in a loop system and clog things because you have so much horizontal plumbing - especially if it's pvc. 90 degree angles are not ideal for loops. I noticed a little buildup in mine, but it didn't clog; maybe because the flow keeps it clear. Overall though it's largely an architectural decision and not a technical one."
aquaponics,2ziv03,snaps109,1 point,Wed Mar 18 22:58:28 2015 UTC,"Would the vertical pipe farthest away from the pump have the same water pressure as the one closest?   The vertical pipe furthest away from the pump will have less pressure than one closer to the pump, but how much depends on how small the holes are in the mister heads.  The pump you described is pretty large, so I suspect you can get away with a lot of flow (larger holes in the misters).      What if the distance was increased to 40 or 60 feet, would the results be the same?    The only thing that affects a pump is head loss through the filter and misters and how high the pump has to push water.  If you have five of those 8' misters in series, the pump sees it as only 8', regardless if it's 20' away or 60' away.  Of course there is some frictional loss through the pipe and pipe fittings, but I think it's negligible.      I [w]ant to add an effective filter   Good.  Misters love to clog.  Unclogging misters is a real chore.     It's also worth mentioning that you don't want to restrict your pump too much by having it push against tiny holes in the misters 24/7.  Maybe you could tee off after the filter and have some flow going to the fish and planted area.     I don't completely understand what you want to do in the second half of your post, but don't give the pump a chance to suck in air.  It's bad for the pump and bad for the fish if microbubbles are introduced."
aquaponics,2ziv03,poopsmith1976,1 point,Thu Mar 19 01:44:32 2015 UTC,"1) No. Each outlet will have less and presure as you move away from the pump. Installing flor control valves will help you. Otherwise you can creat a series of manifolds to distribute the flow as much as you can.   2) Aside from the head loss in each mister, increasing the distance will affect flow because of increase pipe headloss.  Headloss in the pipe can be decreased by using a bigger diamater pipe, but this will also reduce the velocity of the water inside the pipe. You will have to find a compromise between headloss and velocity.   I do not see it completely unfeasible, but your pump inlet pipe should be as deep as possible in the system, but not touching the bottom of the pool so you end up sucking solids. Make it 20cm or 30cm above the bottom if you want a number.   I would not advice that you use the pump to draw solids out of the system. The pump will grind the crap and make its removal more complicated. On thing you coulddo once in a shile is to cut theflow to the filters and plants and diverted outside the system. That way you can use your pump every now and then to flush the solids out of the system.   I do not know the pumping head of this pump or its curve to its hard to know how much flow you will actually be getting."

aquaponics,2zgmbh,Optimoprimo,2,Wed Mar 18 13:56:55 2015 UTC,"Small, indoor with grow lights. 3D prints are not watertight, but you can coat them with epoxy to make them so."
aquaponics,2zgmbh,Optimoprimo,3,Wed Mar 18 14:13:17 2015 UTC,"Okay that helps a lot. I've read that epoxy can be funny if left underwater indefinitely; they have aquarium-safe epoxy that is crazy expensive for that reason... coating the outside with the standard epoxy shouldn't be an issue though. Keep in mind this stuff is going to have to hold under a lot of weight - 10 gallons (38 liters) of water weighs around 85 pounds (38 kilos).  If you are looking for something simple, there are a few iterations of the basic ""pump from the tank into the bed and back"" setups that look fairly nice. This one you could print the frame and the tray around a simple aquarium, or go a little bigger with something like this. Go with the classic 1/2'' black vinyl tubing and 1/2'' pvc for your plumbing; it's cheap, modular and easy to cut. Will hold forever.   There's one other crazy fancy design; since I don't know your budget I'll mention it. It basically looks like this, but the left section would be your media bed and the right section would be about half as tall. The dividing panel would also be slightly lower than the surrounding sides, or just have a hole near the top. You could then just flood the right side from a hidden sump below and let it overflow into the left side, filling the media bed. The bed water would fall back into the sump. This is the little indoor system I've always wanted but don't have the means to make.  Hydroton is the classic lightweight growing media for AP, but people use anything that is inert - river rocks, shale, perlite, growstones (inertness under debate). If you want to stay simple, I would just have a constant flood to your media bed and set up a timer. Not all plants like constant flood, but most herbs and lettuces do quite well."

aquaponics,2zawvq,AustinRN,2,Tue Mar 17 01:38:56 2015 UTC,"Ammonia is secreted largely through the gills of your fish, not feces. There are beneficial components to fish feces, but they aren't necessary and the solid buildup can become a problem. The fecal solids will disintegrate over time, usually to be pulled up into the pump and deposited in your media bed. If you have gravel it will also settle in the gravel and promote anaerobic conditions (bad). Having some mechanical filtration, like the white fibrous stuff, helps remove some of this. You don't want it settling in gravel or in corners. In the media bed is fine, but the solids build up over time and will need to be cleaned out of your media bed."
aquaponics,2zawvq,Optimoprimo,1 point,Tue Mar 17 02:18:54 2015 UTC,Are there creatures (snails?) that I can put in the tank that will remove the fish waste?  Or even some plant or something?

aquaponics,2zawvq,Caseycrowe,2,Thu Mar 19 01:42:15 2015 UTC,"The ideal situation would be you have a sump tank that the fish tank drains into, the pump would be in the sump tank. You put a solids lifting overflow in the tank that runs through a filter of some kind then into the sump tank. Solids lifting tubes are very effective, especially if you have energetic fish that move the water around a lot, or if you have a powerhead in your tank. Unless you use very fine media some solids will get through to your sump and be sucked up by the pump and into the beds You can put composting worms in your media beds to help break that down. But if the solids build up and get anaerobic as /u/Optimoprimo said, its bad times for everyone.   If you do filter out some solids, you will need to clean the filters from time to time and remove the solids. You can use them in a dirt garden, or put them into mineralization tanks to free up nutrients to return to the system."

The pump should pick up the poop but if you have too many fish or too weak a pump, it could accumulate.  For perspective, I have 8 goldfish (of various sizes) in 60 gallons of water with no gravel and a 250 GPH pump. There's always a little bit of poop in the bottom of the tank, but it doesn't accumulate and is way less than the amount of food I add each day."

aquaponics,2z9u9r,vinney1369,2,Tue Mar 17 07:04:02 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry, I'm not familiar with the setup.  At first glance I'd suggest upping the airflow if you could, roots and fish need oxygen.  It would also help push some of the stale air/moisture between the tank and the growing medium and cut down on the fungus.  Next I'd make sure the medium isn't overly wet, this will only cut more oxygen out.  Other than that, I don't think this is a light issue.    This looks a lot like what happens to my cat's wheat grass when I set it in a bowl of water for too long without changing it."

It is much more cost efficient to hear your water than your air. So, spend your money on insulating your tanks, streams, grow beds, and other water containers. Insulate your pipes with foam, cover your tanks with styrofoam sheets (fish prefer it dark anyways) and use natural gas or propane to heat your water to 65 for just those months. Then you can build whatever greenhouse is most cost effective for you without relying on it for all your heat retention."

If someone just adds water, fish and plugs it in without knowing at least what's going on at a vague level, they risk being dissapointed and dismissing aquaponics and all its potential.  These systems are good concepts in as much that they are made by people who are trying to push the limits of what can be done. The failure of these systems will prompt better alternatives until (hopefully) we will reach the absolute minimum size of a desktop aquaponics system (10-20L) that works. But currently, most of these smaller systems will ultimately fail because of:     Unproper waste management (solids will accumulate on the bottom gravel and eventually anaerobic zones will form)  Algae growth on the walls of the fish tank given its transparency will deprive the fish, the plants and most importantly the aerobic bacteria of oxygen.

If you look at the low ratings on reviews, it's people that can't figure out why the tank got dirty or their plants/fish died, complaining about the promise that it's ""self cleaning."" Their pH is probably 8 or higher and once the Wheatgrass gives out after 2 weeks, their chemistries spike. Without doing the research, they have no idea this is what's going on and just expect the thing to plug and play perfectly.

This is a great cheap pump on amazon. I know it seems like the gallons per hour are high, and with a small system that becomes an issue. If flow is too disruptive in your tank, your fish aren't happy. If flow is too high in your tiny grow bed, your plants aren't happy. I split the flow from my pump to divert some of it to two media beds and a third directly back into my tank. The splitting system was made of PVC and ball valves. It was the only way to reduce the flow rate so it wasn't crazy disruptive. A timer only costs about 10 USD and 15 min intervals really do help, even for an ornamental tank. I'd also recommend a bell siphon just because they're cool and can be made small. It helps your roots breathe.  I have aggressive filtration; small systems are very delicate and temperamental. Having lots of physical and biological filtration helps with this. I have an under gravel filter and also made a small canister filter that I run the water through before the media bed; you can make one out of anything water-tight. This provides a bit more water for your system and more aggressive filtration. Mine is full of filter mesh and bucky balls. I found that without this pre-filter, my media was getting disgusting within a few months.  My cheap fluorescent light worked like crap. You just can't grow things with anything but a good window or a good grow light. Amazon occasionally has great deals on lights, like this one. The T5's are great for little indoor systems.  Using clear acrylic tubing was stupid. It ended up with so much growth it gummed up everything. It also leaked like crazy everywhere even with hose clamps because it wasn't really made for any pressure. Use cheap black vinyl pond tubing like this. It's made specifically for this purpose and doesn't cost much more.  Heating a small system like this is a pain in the ass. I had a heater that was rated for 30 gallons, a heater in my canister, and it still couldn't keep up. Because there's so little water, as your water recirculates, it cools to room temp quickly. This makes your fish have to deal with constant temp fluctuations, which is stressful for them. You can get expensive line heaters on top of a heater for each tank, keep the room your tank is in at 24 degrees C, or just use cold water fish. I'd recommend the latter unless you have a good budget.  Finally, you still want to follow the general rules of aquarium keeping. Cichlids have no business in a 10 gallon tank, its way too small for them. Also an ideal pH for plants is ~6.8, so you need fish that are pH tolerant. I'm a little more lenient about goldfish and personally feel you can put 1-2 in a 10 gallon if you know how to keep your water chemistry happy. Goldfish police in this sub will tell you otherwise. That's up to your own opinion and research. Many people like to plant their ornamental AP tank, which is fine as long as they don't suck up all the nutrients and leave your herbs with nothing. I got rid of that second tank up top because I was naively hoping to use it as a little DWC area, but it became more hassle than it was worth for 4 net cups. I now have a 10 gallon tote, which is about the size you would want for your growbed as well. Fill it as high as you can to give your plants maximum root space."

aquaponics,2ysxzs,DavidSlain,3,Thu Mar 12 15:41:20 2015 UTC,"Hydroton is brittle and will turn to tiny pieces when broken. Most of the breaking occurs during movement; once the hydroton is in place, it doesn't degrade just from sitting there and is really unlikely to clog anything. If you aren't running any prefilter, then your growbed is going to catch all the solids from your fish tank, though, and THAT will need to be cleaned out periodically. Even if you add worms. How often varies a lot; I usually just clean whenever my plant load is at it's lowest - around once per year."

aquaponics,2ysxzs,Whittigo,3,Thu Mar 12 17:34:10 2015 UTC,"As /u/Optimoprimo said, they will clog without some prefilter, but they will do a very good job of filtering. I'd suggest a good prefilter, you can remove the solids and reuse them in wicking beds or traditional dirt gardens. It likely wont catch everything without an elaborate setup, so still some for worms, but maybe enough they can keep up with only needing cleaned every few years instead of yearly. And having your NFT in series after the beds is how many people run it."

The pump injects compressed air at the bottom of the discharge pipe which is immersed in the liquid. The compressed air mixes with the liquid causing the air-water mixture to be less dense than the rest of the liquid around it and therefore is displaced upwards through the discharge pipe by the surrounding liquid of higher density. Solids may be entrained in the flow and if small enough to fit through the pipe, will be discharged with the rest of the flow at a shallower depth or above the surface. Airlift pumps are widely used in Aquaculture to pump, circulate and aerate water in closed, recirculating systems and ponds.  Other applications include dredging, underwater archaeology, salvage operations and collection of scientific specimens.

aquaponics,2yn0di,joelTURNDOWNTHETV,3,Wed Mar 11 03:12:38 2015 UTC,I can't comment on the nuances of auquaponics but I run quite a few plants in RDWC only in growstones and they have never affected my PH or PPM to any noticeable degree. I  just give them a good soak before introduction into the system and the excess dust washes off.
aquaponics,2yn0di,spunfunk,1 point,Wed Mar 11 05:47:09 2015 UTC,How long have you been running your system? I've read that they degrade over time and fall into pieces. This is on the year scale.
aquaponics,2yn0di,Optimoprimo,1 point,Wed Mar 11 14:31:16 2015 UTC,About a year now and we just wash the used ones in H2O2 and toss them back into the system. I'm sure they degrade over time but not at any rate that is causing any concern.
aquaponics,2yn0di,spunfunk,0,Wed Mar 11 15:24:11 2015 UTC,"Interesting. By ppm i assume you mean hardness? As i mentioned, my ph doesnt seem to be affected, but the hardness numbers are very high. The growstones do produce a fine powder as they are used, which is in direct conflict with their claims on the front page of their website. I actually had to add more rocks to my beds more than once because as i used them over time the fill level decreased fairly noticeably. I rinsed and rinsed this stuff before introducing it to my system as well. The website claims the stones are 98% soda lime glass. One of the main ingredients of soda lime glass is sodium carbonate (soda). So as i see them breaking down into my water, i have to suspect they are the culprit. Now, i do have eco complete substrate in my 55, but it is partially capped by the same inert sand in my 20 and it has been in there for about a year. I suppose this could be adding to the problem but i suspect the main issue is the grow stones. I am going to eliminate them from the system for a while and see if that improves my hardness."
aquaponics,2yn0di,spunfunk,1 point,Wed Mar 11 06:12:47 2015 UTC,"Yeah go for it, eliminate one variable at a time until you figure it out. I obviously don't know the details of your system, but I would be skeptical that such an inert and widely used grow medium is the entire problem here. Have you been running any plants or just measuring the water?"
aquaponics,2yn0di,spunfunk,1 point,Wed Mar 11 15:32:57 2015 UTC,"Is it really that widely used successfully though? And is it really inert? I don't see how it can be inert given the components of soda lime glass. The glass itself is inert, but I have my doubts about whether or not the growstone powder is.   I have seen a lot of posts online that complain about the stones, with ph data included. It seems that most people cannot alter the ph of their water after the addition of the grow stones, which is indicative of very hard water. I have seen posts here and there which say ""I am successful"" but there is no real data on their system, including water parameters. Do you have data showing an ability to control ph?   I am going to set up an experiment tonight and soak water in the growstones and also in my tank substrate and compare."
aquaponics,2yn0di,paradoxbomb,1 point,Wed Mar 11 16:10:30 2015 UTC,"I don't have any peer-reviewed reports or any specific documentation, but I'm running 170 Cannabis plants (just in the flowering room) with 3 successful harvests only in RDWC with growstones. The PH drift is comparable to any system and is rather stable but also easy to adjust. Most systems are finikey at first but when the plants get situated things alway even out.  I'm not pushing for you to use them obviously, but blaming these issues on the medium is a bold statement. When I run into issues it almost always is my fault (improper nute/PH dosing, lockout, water temp, etc.) not the fault of faulty equipment or medium."
aquaponics,2yn0di,paradoxbomb,1 point,Wed Mar 11 18:29:54 2015 UTC,"I've posted something similar to this elsewhere, but growstones are working for me. Not that I would recommend them without some huge caveats, but once I pushed through the pH and hardness issues (which took almost a full year), they're working out fine. The glass they're made from is pH neutral (from beer bottles if I recall), but they use calcium carbonate as a foaming agent, so it's the CaCO3 that causes the pH rise. There can be a TON of it in the bag with the stones, a fact which they unhelpfully hide unless you read the fine print on the website.  My system is a 50 gallon grow bed with a bell siphon to a 70 gallon fish tank. Simple flood/drain, no sump. I added an experimental 10 gallon wicking tank that I'm trying some herbs out in. Here's a photo for reference.  Here are my current pH, KH, and GH measurements:   pH: 7.4 (Usually 7.2 - I think the rain last night washed some more carbonates in from the upper stones) KH: 1 drop (basically nothing) GH: 5 drops   I haven't done any water changes since December, only topped-up with RO or rain water. Before that, I measured GH more frequently and confirmed that it would rise after doing a water change with RO water. Last I checked in early December, it was at about 7 drops. I guess I've either rinsed out the excess carbonates with water changes or my plants are absorbing them.  I'm not sure what to do about different media for your system, but if you want to make the growstones work, you can do one of these 2 things:  Temporary switch to hydroponics - this is what I did   Take out your fish or route the water around them Add a lot of ammonia (1/2 tsp per day per 60 gallons is what I did) Wait. Growstones at least have the ability to form an incredible biofilter and all the cycling will balance things out eventually. Do water changes with RO water to speed things up and remove the dissolved carbonates   Rinse until stable - I haven't done this but I think it would work   Put all the stones in to a big tank Add RO water and HCl acid Add more acid when the pH goes back up to 8.3 or so When the GH gets high, switch out the water and repeat   Hope this helps stem the pain somehow.  edit - formatting"

aquaponics,2ylr10,tedromanetz,2,Tue Mar 10 21:18:26 2015 UTC,"Sorry, that is something you probably should start out with.  We have a three hundred gallon Rubbermaid stock tank buried almost to the lip in the ground as our fish tank.  In our fish tank are four air stones coming from our air pump and a 300W heater connected to a thermostat set at 75 Fahrenheit. Above the fish tank about 18 inches off the ground are our two grow beds.  The beds are a foot deep, filled with clay pebbles, and drain off bell siphons directly into the fish tank.  One of the beds is 8' long by 4' wide, the other is 4' wide by 6' long.  The beds are arranged in the corner of my school's greenhouse in an L shape.  Water is pumped up roughly 6 feet to a swirl filter made from an office water jug, from there it runs into a simpler sump-tank like filter (was intended to be a sand filter but the water moved too fast).  It then drains into a pipe which splits between the beds and ball valves are used to adjust the flood-drain times of the beds.  We have 30 talapia (probably will need more here soon) and the grow beds are packed with lettuce, herbs, peas, and char.  The grow beds are also home to a happy colony of red wriggler worms.  I hope this is enough to get a grasp of the system, I'm not near the system, this is all from memory so I may have messed up a few details (let me know if I need more details or pictures. I don't have an Imgur account but can get one if its necessary)"
aquaponics,2ylr10,DavidSlain,2,Wed Mar 11 05:22:59 2015 UTC,"Well, this is still limited information, but you could:    Upgrade the bell siphons to make them more reliable. Run an NFT setup after your grow beds in the water cycle.  I don't know the impacts of this on the system, considering my knowledge of Aquaponics is, for the moment, purely theoretical. The filter could be replaced with a radial flow filter, and you could divert the waste-rich water from that to grow duckweed for the fish. Grow a tree!  Apparently they thrive in aquaponics if they have their own pot.  We know at least bananas have been successfully grown. Put an aeration bar along the perimeter of the fish tank to improve oxygen.  You could probably eliminate half of your air stones. Go solar!  Get some deep cycle marine batteries, an inverter, and a charging regulator, run water to the roof and back down again to ease the burden on your heater, and plug your pumps into the inverter. There's a few challenges that we don't have the best answers to yet (I don't think)- like how to grow carrots and potatoes in this kind of environment.  I'd imagine solving those issues would be an amazing project for the kids. You could incorporate more than just fish in your tank, like adding prawns and/or snails."

aquaponics,2ykvsk,Jarnagua,2,Tue Mar 10 18:12:01 2015 UTC,"Well, on the system from the article they claim 1.5 pounds of protein per week.  Let's say that's absurdly high, and they only produce one pound instead.  High protein feeds are what, 50%, right? So that's 2 pounds of fish food per week.  One full grown Tilapia eats .105 pounds of feed per week (if feeding for consumption/market), meaning with the mealworm farm alone you can support 19 full grown Tilapia at a time, in terms of protein consumption.  If you have a small Duckweed grow tank along with these mealworms, that number can be stretched quite a bit, considering duckweed is about 35% Protein on it's own.    By the numbers, this looks very promising."
aquaponics,2ykvsk,DavidSlain,2,Tue Mar 10 21:48:49 2015 UTC,"Especially since duckweed needs sun to grow, so you would have to have long shallow tanks to grow as much protein, this verticle tower system looks great. I would want to know how much food goes into it though, they show scraps of veggies and whatnot and they say they feed them some every day. On top of the wheat and rabbit poo mixture.   I don't think I'll ever go that crazy with it that I'm completely self sufficient off the grid grow my own fish food, but it's a neat idea. I'm crazy enough to see how viable it is to grow all my own food, but I have no problem buying fish food. Down the road I might build a soldier fly larva box with a ramp ending over the fish tank, that's just lazy enough for me to consider it."

They describe it as inhibiting algee growth, which is good, but not good for us if it might also affect our Nitrifying bacteria. Probably not great for Aquaponics.

But I believe  you need to elaborate and be more exact regarding cooking temperatures and times (which is well established.) Additionally when you put your sealed jar back into the oven, you didn't mention to loosen the lib slightly as you have created a little bomb inside the oven with it sealed.  While tomatoes are acidic and preserve easily, it should be known that not every vegetable can be preserved so easily, and can create exposure to botulism."
aquaponics,2yb8cy,effgee,0,Sun Mar 8 21:26:06 2015 UTC,"Actually, I leave the lid on tight to create pressure inside the bottle, the pressure built up can kill off anything else that's stubborn inside there.  I've done masses of bottles this way, and never had a little bomb. But I do say to leave it alone and allow it to cool inside the oven.  Good idea about the exact times though, I'll add it to the description of the video!"
aquaponics,2yb8cy,effgee,4,Sun Mar 8 21:57:51 2015 UTC,"Seriously, just cause it hasn't happened yet, doesn't mean it wont. Those glass bottles are not designed for what you are doing! Please don't do that! Might as well microwave some spray paint cans while you are at it.   Better to leave the lid lightly  unscrewed, boil them, then after you are done cooking them tighten up the lids while they are still hot. As they cool, the lid tops vacuum seal button will be pulled down  creating a seal. This way if you have biological activity (its presence is usually foretold by by gas (co2) production) and the lid will pop up if the stuff within has gone south.  I've been canning stuff for awhile and you gotta be thorough! Those jars are designed for vacuum, not internalized pressure."

I have 1 betta and 2 snails in mine but it seems to be sufficient as long as I don't overcrowd the pots and only leave a plant or two per.  My problem is the algae though. I see the reply you made about the UV blocking film and I'm def interested in seeing how that works. Could you respond in say a month or so on how it seems to be doing? I got the snails to help deal with it, but I'd honestly need way more then 2 to really make a dent so I end up having to clean the tank every like 2-3 months or so."

aquaponics,2y7bmm,hjras,2,Sat Mar 7 09:40:41 2015 UTC,"There's two things which I have done that solve the problem. The first is layering your media with two different types of media (ex: clay pebble layer, then lava gravel layer, then clay, etc), as the weight of the heavier layer should prevent the lighter layer from floating. Another option is to buy an ecological soap and rinse the clay pebbles in a separate container, and then rinse them again just with clean water 2-3 times. If your system is already cycled then you'll have to start over though.  P.S: To my knowledge this has been a problem to everyone that uses expanded clay aggregate media. Some types take less time to stop floating than others. Mine still float after using them for a year, so I use the layer technique. Check here for some images."

aquaponics,2y4fn4,denjin,6,Fri Mar 6 15:38:46 2015 UTC,So the lesson to be learned from this is that you can never be sure an automated system is going to work properly.  Maybe another good idea would be to build the heater in such a way that the feed / entry point for fuel is outside while the rest of the system feeds into the greenhouse that way if there is a blockage and smoke back flows at least it'll just be venting out into the air.  Another safety precaution would be to have a smoke detector placed above the entry feed to catch any exhaust exiting the wrong way.
aquaponics,2y4fn4,anothergaijin,1 point,Fri Mar 6 16:01:55 2015 UTC,"So the lesson to be learned from this is that you can never be sure an automated system is going to work properly.

aquaponics,2y4fn4,ironsickel,2,Sat Mar 7 02:33:22 2015 UTC,"I think the lesson to be learned is that a rocket mass auto feeding system like this needs to fail...safe.  Sounds like the feeding kept happening, but the chimney stack got clogged, so it kept burning and producing smoke.  If the chimney section was sealed, a backup of smoke would smother the flame (maybe?).  I'm not an expert in rocketmass systems and his system is super advanced anyway.  But there should be some sort of fail safe on this.  And probably a fail safe against what happens when the fire goes out and the temperature drops (sets off an alarm in the house or something).  I follow Bigelow Brook...he's an inspiration (has been ever since he first started his aquaponics system in a tiny store bought greenhouse).  This is truly heart breaking.  But if there's one thing i'm sure of, is he'll figure it out and come back with a better system.  I also wonder if the damage is as extensive as he thinks.  Plants are incredibly resilient.  Sure they may be soot covered, but that doesn't mean the plants are dead.  I would give them a few days after a water change and see what happens.  But I probably wouldn't eat the lettuce.  Soot is almost impossible to get off and I would probably not want to eat it."
aquaponics,2y4fn4,Whittigo,1 point,Fri Mar 6 16:48:32 2015 UTC,"The strong draft from rocket mass heaters probably kept the flame going into the combustion chamber and out the exhaust, but because it was burning higher in the fuel load smoke got back out the wrong way. Happens a lot with misconfigured systems.  I believe his pellets were gravity fed, some burn, loosens up the stack, more fall down and burn there. A simple solution would be to have a motor driven hopper, advance a screw hopper every 2-3 minutes and drop more pellets in. Never get a backup of pellets and a clog. But requires electricity.  I agree most plants would spring back probably, but also like you said, why would you, probably taste bad. And most of those greens are maybe a week or two old, just pull them out and reseed and start fresh."

aquaponics,2y4fn4,zynix,1 point,Fri Mar 6 23:46:12 2015 UTC,Consolation is that he didn't lose the building itself ( which is pretty snazzy ) vs plants.  Yes its a setback and may end up requiring a full restart BUT plants & fish are cheaper than brick & mortar.

aquaponics,2xxrl6,DecalArtist,2,Thu Mar 5 06:27:00 2015 UTC,"I am not by any means a pro at any of this so these are just my 2 cents on the subject from what I read in a book  1) For the waste filter.  It is not entirely necessary IF you have a small set up and add worms to your grow bed.  The worms eat the fish waste and therefore there isn't as much accumulation in the grow bed to merrit the need of a secondary filter.   I added worms to my bed and my water is rather clear.  Though It wouldn't hurt to add maybe a charcoal filter to your return pipe to catch any debris that might have escaped your biofilter... mine doesn't have one but I am considering it.  2) the first year of it's life your Aquaponics system will need CONSTANT monitoring to ensure it's survival.  If you want a trully remote system you will have to invest in probes and sensors to communicate with you certain conditions where you are 100% required to interract with your system: I.E: Ammonia censors, PH censors,  water level censors etc.   If you leave your system alont for too long you may not be aware of something that has gone awry and by the time you notice it may be too late.   The first year you want to make sure you have a good bio filter going on since this is KEY to your aquaponic's survival  3) Plastic WILL become brittle with sun exposure, I've heard people LINE the inside of their IBC with a pond liner or reinforce it with fiberglass.  Some people keep their IBC away from the sun so that it extends the life... personally I don't think the system will become brittle since it's always full with water, BUT it can happen and that is a risk you have to consider.  4) Shape is just that... shape, however having LONGER grow beds would make it easier for you when you are planting and harvesting or treating, giving you more room vs working with a perfectly SQUARE area,  square you may have to reach further to reach certain plants that may need assistance.  That's just what I think the advantage would be (I'm only 4'9"" tall so a longer grow bed is ideal for me since I hate reaching in far)  5) I personally see no reason to have a mobile setup... I rather just set it and forget it.  But if you think you can accomplish this without problems of pipes leaking due to angle changes etc, by all means go for it.  Would be an interesting build to see.  6) YES... have considered it.. downside.  You need a battery bank that can sustain your pumps while periods of low Sunlight availability.   I would LOVE to have a 100% solar powered system. Unfortunately where I live there are TONS of trees blocking out direct sunlight and my patio (where my System is located) is on the 1st floor and received only 4-5 hrs of direct sunlight.  8) the Aquaponics setup I have seen at my local Hydroponic store seems to be doing very well with Lettuce.   That's all they seem to grow.   I haven't tried lettuce yet, bc the birds in my area like to pick at my baby greens and eat my seeds before they grow out - __ - I had to resort to covering my seeds with clear plastic boxes to create a sort of greenhouse and protect them from birds... but... darn birds like even tiny plants to eat.  7) what area of SO-Cal do you live in? I am in San Diego and the only problem I have encountered regarding raising tilapia is if you ever intend to sell your fish... I have not encountered any issues regarding growing your own fish for your own use.  8) when I had an algae breakout, I threw in a pleco and he cleaned it up in under 2 weeks.  I adjusted my feeding schedules and got rid of the Pleco since there was no more algae for him to eat.  Just watch your feeding.   My System is outside and I haven't had algae return since... the pleco was really inexpensive and fun to look at.  9) circulating the water is always a good idea to prevent dead spots in your system.   Just set up your bell siphons so drain in areas that would otherwise not receive much current, OR purchase a Powerhead (powerheads are specifically for the purpose of MOVING water and are much less complex than a Pump, hence they will not plug up often...) most powerheads come with a trap so that they will prevent fish from getting sucked in, buuut I lost my filter cap sooo :x  lesson in progress for me.  10) I am not entirely sure I am qualified enough to give advice :p buuut just be ready to build and take appart your system or design several times until you get it just right.   I had to rebuild my System twice, and rework my filtration setup about 5 times before I got the Flooding and draining right.  The book I read was ""Aquaponic Gardening"" by Sylvia Bernstein.  It was a very enlightening read and I enjoyed it cover to cover :)"
aquaponics,2xxrl6,AngryAnuses,2,Wed Mar 4 21:46:26 2015 UTC,"Using a charcoal filter isn't a good idea. The activated carbon will absorb a lot of the nutrients that the plants need. That's why it's a big no no to add them to planted aquariums, and I assume it is the same for aquaponic setups. Filter floss would work a lot better at catching solid waste."
aquaponics,2xxrl6,DecalArtist,2,Fri Mar 6 17:53:05 2015 UTC,oh no.  I meant the charcoal filter is going to be on the OUTPUT (the drain that drains into my fish holding tank)  or do you think it is  still an overall a bad idea?
aquaponics,2xxrl6,AngryAnuses,2,Fri Mar 6 18:02:19 2015 UTC,I would still avoid it because not all nutrients are absorbed by the plants on the first pass through the plants

aquaponics,2xxrl6,Whittigo,1 point,Fri Mar 6 18:18:08 2015 UTC,"Wow, thank you for your insight.  The information and advice is much appreciated.  I actually saw that book in Barnes and Noble about a year ago, read a few chapters in the store, and it's the primary reason I'm looking into this now.  I'll have to go back and buy it.  You're probably right about the Tilapia- I'm in the LA area, but I'll have to check again.  The powerhead is a great idea, thanks!  I'm thinking that the solar and battery setup would be fine on three deep cycle marine vehicle batteries.  Maybe a sensor for the last one in sequence, to warn me at half charge.  I'm probably going to use a bird mesh over PVC assembly to keep the pesky avians outta my food."
aquaponics,2xxrl6,Whittigo,2,Thu Mar 5 06:26:17 2015 UTC,"Assume solids filtration as absolutely necessary. Media beds and worms help, but the waste doesn't disappear, worms leave behind some waste of their own too, eventually it will clog your beds and you will have to clean them out probably at least once a year. Especially of you are feeding at a high rate to grow your fish for consumption. Those using goldfish just to run the system don't have as much solid waste problems."
aquaponics,2xxrl6,Whittigo,1 point,Thu Mar 5 15:54:16 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the reply.  Would you then do the solid filtration after the grow bed, or before?  I was planning on having worms."
aquaponics,2xxrl6,Whittigo,2,Thu Mar 5 17:05:35 2015 UTC,"Before. Unless you have a great filter some will get through. And the worms will have roots and plant matter to eat too.

Perhaps you would be in that situation; however, there are many parts of this world that don't have a Home Depot that they can walk down to and buy large pipe from. It doesn't matter what the circumstances are that restrict the individual's access to the resources of being able to build a large siphon. It's a siphon, not an airplane. It's ok to use multiple small siphons if you don't have the physical means to build a single large siphon, and this guy has built a way to link them together in a rather simple (it's not complex whatsoever for anyone who understands how vacuums work) manner to assist those who may be in that situation.  I mean, hell, let's just shit on a guy who designed something for a problem that you personally don't have and there are likely millions of people in other third world countries that may actually have access to narrow pipe and could benefit from large aquaponic beds to keep their families fed. I hope you can see how arrogant your stance is. I tried to be friendly and appreciative of your candor, but frankly it's unproductive and unnecessary. I'm certainly not trying to be an asshole about my response. The demeanor and dismissal that you are exhibiting makes that difficult (because it's hard to actually take you as anything but intentionally dismissive of other individual's circumstances). It's almost like you've never run into a situation where you wanted to build something that you felt necessary and didn't have access to parts to do it. I suppose that's when someone with your stance would just give up."
aquaponics,2xvzv1,Aquaponics-Heretic,0,Fri Mar 6 05:45:06 2015 UTC,"I hope you can see how arrogant your stance is   Perhaps the appearance of ""arrogance"" is due to the fact that I've been around hydroponics for three decades... and aquaculture and AP for a decade...

He could just as well probably solved his problem... by using 1.5"" drain pipes... instead of 1"" pipes the same diameter as his standpipe...

Having ready access to something and not having the money to buy those things are both obstacles to ""just doing it bigger."" It's clear that while you may have been ""in hydroponics for three decades"" that you must not have had a situation where you simply don't have access to the resources necessary to ""go bigger."" Be it access to the pipe itself or the funds to purchase the pipe. Now, before you come back with a smartass wink about the cost of pipe: Many times in the circumstances that this would be suiting for those people aren't buying the pipe. Perhaps it's been donated. Perhaps it's been salvaged. There are more circumstances that could absolutely justify them not having access to 3-4"" pipe. Your arrogance comes not from your experience but your inability to see outside of the little box you've created for yourself. I'd venture that you're a real treat to teach things to because you likely figure you have all the answers already.  Now, onto the desert (and your lack of understanding of analogy it would seem): I was using the desert as an example of being separated from this ready source of resources that you seem to have and think everyone else does... As you simply have no grasp of the statement I've made (and you've now made this clear with both the smartass responses as well as your attempt at serious dialog) it's clear that carrying on a conversation with you will be futile.

Your mentality would keep everyone from inventing, experimenting, solving problems that you don't personally have.  Also regarding the desert: Please don't be so ignorant... The Aussies have been a fore-runner in using hydroponics and aquaponics for a very long time and are very firmly planted in desert... guess what? They run large grow beds. Had you taken the time to explore the problem that the solution resolves instead of nay-saying it you may have learned that not all problems are problems you personally will experience. I suppose we should just stop pollution reduction, keep cutting down those rainforests, etc. because in the end it's not going to affect you but someone else, right? Of course not. The mentality would be ridiculous, arrogant, and ignorant.  You're exhibiting what's called an intellectual fallacy here.... You're coming from a false sense of authority, and quite frankly it's tired and worn out.

aquaponics,2xv16m,AngryAnuses,1 point,Thu Mar 5 06:16:25 2015 UTC,Possible disease.  A lot of times you can take a dead fish and water sample to the store you purchased from to get a diagnosis and water test.

I have moved it tons to different windows for sunlight since its still winter time in Oklahoma.    My plant hasn't grown too much but the past week it really has started to take off.     But this is my first attempt at aquaponics and I saw this setup a while back and decided to give it a try.
aquaponics,2xt5xj,__Levi,1 point,Tue Mar 3 18:22:15 2015 UTC,Did you come up with the setup?
aquaponics,2xt5xj,denjin,2,Tue Mar 3 18:25:25 2015 UTC,No I saw this setup a long time ago in this subreddit.    But I have been unable to find the thread ever since.     Some dude had a step by step youtube video on how to set this up.    I just followed his setup instructions and figured it was an awesome aquaponics setup for me first time trying.      I'm by far no expert on any of this so I'm just shocked I haven't killed my plant yet.    I have 7 small goldfish in the bottom with one pleco to help keep it clean.     One problem I have ran into is the splash coming down ends up getting out of the tank.   so usually every week I'm having to add more water into the bottom.    But I don't do anything special.   Just fill it back up with tap water.    No fish have died YET.   I have had this up and running since September of last year.
aquaponics,2xt5xj,Optimoprimo,2,Tue Mar 3 18:32:27 2015 UTC,7 goldfish seems like a lot for that much water.  I guess if none have died yet its fine.  :)
aquaponics,2xt5xj,Optimoprimo,1 point,Tue Mar 3 18:50:49 2015 UTC,Yea my wife is amazed that none have died especially since I fill the tank usually once a week with straight tap water and don't add any water treatment chemicals to it.    I feed them every morning and they seem happy happy.
aquaponics,2xt5xj,Optimoprimo,1 point,Tue Mar 3 19:07:07 2015 UTC,Neat.  It looks like it would be really easy to clean & give a water change if the fish start looking sickly anyway.  My system is an ordeal to clean.
aquaponics,2xt5xj,hoodectomy,1 point,Tue Mar 3 19:17:18 2015 UTC,Honestly the only thing that I have had to clean was the water pump filter.    For that all i did was pull it out of the bottom tank take the pump apart clean the filter and replace it back into the bottom tank.    The pleca honestly keeps all the algea off the bottom tank.    At least I assume its the pleca.
aquaponics,2xt5xj,tankbros,1 point,Tue Mar 3 19:28:48 2015 UTC,"A simple fish care tip would be to let the water stand for an hour or two after drawing it from the tap before adding it to your fish tank.  This lets it balance to the temperature of the room and decreases stress on the fish.  Also, is that all the growth you've had in the pepper plant since September? I'd expect a chilli plant to be fully matured and producing after 5 months..."
aquaponics,2xu7xm,jsb0805,2,Tue Mar 3 22:33:30 2015 UTC,"My tap water is about 8.2, and I use hydrochloric (muriatic) acid from the hardware store to lower it.  It's cheap and powerful.  Make sure to mix it with water first and start with small amounts.  The key is patience.  It's ok if you don't see a change in pH for a little while.  Mix a bit (maybe 0.5 ml in 5 gallons), then add, then wait 24 hours and test your pond water.  Mix a bit more (maybe 1-2 ml this time), then add, then wait and test again. The key is not to make the pH plummet too fast with your HCl additions.  Once the pH starts to move, just repeat with small amounts until it gets to the desired range.  The other option is to just wait.  As long as you have no source of carbonates in your system (from limestone, growstones, shells, etc.), the pH will naturally lower as a consequence of nitrification.  Then it's just a matter of balancing your top-up water before you add it.  This will lower the pH, but keeping your pH at a particular level can be really tough due to many factors.  It's been the hardest battle in my system, and my biggest takeaway from the experience is ""go slow"".  You can also get a KH test kit (API makes one) that will help you if you aren't seeing the pH drop.  You have to get your KH down before pH will move, and the test kit will help you judge how much of your buffer you've used up while you're lowering it."
aquaponics,2xu7xm,paradoxbomb,1 point,Wed Mar 4 00:06:06 2015 UTC,We have similar water in Phoenix and what I did was 75% reverse osmosis water and 25% tap. PH is now about 7.8 instead of the 8.2 I started with and I am expecting the nitrification process to lower it some more.  I did the mix because I wanted to maintain some buffer in the water so the PH is easier to maintain.  With pure RO water then there would be nothing to buffer the water and PH could swing wildly.
aquaponics,2xu7xm,Wingnut537,1 point,Wed Mar 4 00:16:25 2015 UTC,"I have a pretty big system (300) gallons. I use garden lime from home depot, or lemon juice from my lemon tree to stabilize the pH."
aquaponics,2xu7xm,FivePtFiveSix,3,Wed Mar 4 03:24:32 2015 UTC,Be careful using things with citric acid - it kills bacteria and can trash your bio filtration.
aquaponics,2xu7xm,Optimoprimo,1 point,Wed Mar 4 04:19:15 2015 UTC,"http://www.reddit.com/r/aquaponics/wiki/additives#wiki_ph_lowering_compounds  HCL/muriatic is much more powerful and good for fish skin slime development.  Phosphoric is my preferred but its a tad weaker ( so you will need a bit more ) BUT phosphoric acid will react to calcium carbonate to create calcium phosphate which is still accessible to plants.  Finally, 200 gallons if utilized more will naturally become acid due to nitrification.  If possible, don't try to push your pH down but grow something hardy or prolific ( mint comes to mind ), feed your fish, and see if you can get the pH down on it's own.  Additional questions:  What is your KH?  How old is the pond/aquaponic system?  How many fish, type, and age are in the pond?"
aquaponics,2xplvz,ApartmentHerbs,7,Mon Mar 2 21:14:51 2015 UTC,"There's some good info online about this, but unfortunately, your small tank is really only humane enough for a beta fish, or some guppies or something.  Most fish need a bit more space than 5 gallons if you want to give your fish a decent life.  If not, you'll need to pack in a few more fish for those plants.  Sorry I can't be more specific, I'm at work and can't really look things up right now."
aquaponics,2xplvz,dirk558,5,Mon Mar 2 21:58:25 2015 UTC,"Well, start looking for homes for the goldfish because they're going to outgrow that in no time at all.  As far as future stocking, your plants will use up some or most of the nitrates, but there's still only so much swimming space in that tote.  I'd second a Betta, but that's probably not going to provide enough nitrate for that many plants.  Maybe some female Bettas?  You'll have to deal with everything that comes with keeping a group of pissy females together in a small space though and that's a challenge in itself.  Whitecloud minnows would be my next guess, since they're ok with room temperature water, but they like to have space to swim.    Stocking a 5 gallon is tough.  Especially since you need enough bioload to support your plants without using big, messy fish."

aquaponics,2xplvz,Aquaponics-Heretic,3,Tue Mar 3 01:00:07 2015 UTC,"You're probably not going to find real quantifiable data like that because there are so many factors including growth media and I'm not sure it scales up and down linearly.   I have:    a 10 gallon tank; with two goldfish; a water jet; airstones; automated feeders; and an eheim filter- supporting two house plants Imgur (left side) another 4l0L (10 gallon) with two or three yoyo loaches (rescued); a panda catfish; and an algae eater- that supports a large windowsill planter of growth media holding mint/shisou/thai basil and has a eheim filter for extra biomass and 2 water jets; airstones in the tank and biomass area; and an automated feeder Imgur (middle) Finally an outside setup with 150 gallon tub with 5 goldfish (rescued) that runs through PVC pipe with about 10 net baskets with heads of lettuce and an automated koi-pond outdoor feeder.  imgur   These are all stable systems that have lasted about two years a piece    Issues of any cruelty aside- this is fine as a starter/intro and you'll find that you'll likely want to upgrade as things work out- mostly because small systems are a lot harder to take care of.  The thing with goldfish is that they put out a lot of ammonia (so in a small tank ammonia poisoning might be a thing) and the size of the container tends to cap their growth. But I wouldn't sweat the fish thing too much because a few of them might die due to the tank being new (although goldfish are extremely hearty) sketchy source: http://www.firsttankguide.net/newtanksyndrome.php  It's hard to tell you straight away about how many fish etc because this aquarium system looks fresh and not yet cycled- ie. your aquarium probably doesn't have it's fill of microscopic plant life living in it and in the growth bed material you are using. Be aware you'll likely need to treat the new water you add into the tank. (chlorine remover etc) and that adding new water will have a relatively large effect on your tank due to it being compact. sketchy source: http://nippyfish.net/2009/05/27/cycling-a-small-aquarium/  This means that you'll need to watch the amount of food you feed your fish carefully.  100 grams of fish food will generally support about one square meter of plant life. sketchy source: http://www.doityourself.com/stry/aquaponics-knowing-the-fish-to-plant-ratio  The great thing about what you are doing (cycling, establishing your grow bed as a bio filter) is that if you start a new tank, you'll be able to use this water and material to start out a larger tank faster (largely what you did by getting some of their gravel).    Nice tips/ways to scale up or automate things to make your life easier:   Petco often has dollar-per-gallon sales and there's usually tons of tanks on craigslist etc if/when you decide to scale up. Automatic feeders make the process less hands on:  ie. http://www.amazon.com/Automatic-Fish-Feeder-AquaChef-Batteries/dp/B004249KFG A water pump to run the fish water through the growth media might do your tank very well and are quite cheap, this one is 8usd: http://www.amazon.com/Patuoxun-Submersible-Aquarium-Fountain-Hydroponic/dp/B00EU74MJY/  Additional biomass:  This filter (15usd) might add a little additional biomass, which makes your aquarium a little larger and helps breakdown the ammonia etc: http://www.amazon.com/TM1250-Aquarium-Internal-Power-Filter/dp/B00176GKM8/   or  (25usd) http://www.amazon.com/Aquarium-Rapids-Canister-hang---tank/dp/B000YJ0M1E/ Again waterflow (helps with algae) then something like this is about 9 usd: http://www.amazon.com/Submersible-Circulation-Maker-Water-Aquarium/dp/B009YEEW2K/   Note: most of these links are sketchy- just conveying ideas in an easy to read/digestible format."
aquaponics,2xplvz,lilmookie,2,Tue Mar 3 07:03:43 2015 UTC,"Also the growbed has a HUGE impact on your tank. I had a 40L (10 gallon?) tank that I used to have to always clean and cycle even when it was established and had a filter etc... but after I added mint and a grow bed- I literally haven't changed the water for years now (obviously I have to add water) the point being that the important part about the filter/media is what's living inside it, in terms of breaking down waste. Ammonia aside I think the more sceptical side of me thinks that the objections to small tanks are a bit overblown because (1) it's good business to sell large tanks and (2) having an aquarium with no growth media and one with growth media are two totally separate beasts in terms of the amount of life they can support. (that and larger tanks are easier to take care of- they don't fluctuate as much in response to algae/food/disease/water changes/dead fish/etc)"
aquaponics,2xplvz,lilmookie,2,Tue Mar 3 07:22:50 2015 UTC,"With the right size of growbed for the amount of waste production, nitrogenous wastes are more or less a non-issue.  My objection to small tanks and things like goldfish is that they're very active fish that need room to dart around.  Kept correctly, they can grow to over a foot long in a surprisingly short period of time.  Kept incorrectly, their growth will be stunted and while it may be seem good to us for them to stay smaller, the stunting will severely shorten their lifespan.  In my opinion it also reduces their quality of life, but I can't personally speak to fish to find out whether they mind or not.  Maybe they don't care, maybe it's a constant source of discomfort, maybe they don't know any better because they're just fish.    I'll err on the side of caution and stick with big tanks for big fish, because I want to ensure good quality of life for animals in my care.  I realize they are just fish to some people, but they are living, breathing vertebrates and I feel that ought to be taken into consideration when keeping them."
aquaponics,2xplvz,MsRenee,1 point,Tue Mar 3 13:04:39 2015 UTC,"And I love that attitude. I think it's the right one to have. I think te large appeal of aquaponics is keeping a balanced happy system and I think large fish are a sign of a thriving balanced system.  That doesn't need mean that a smaller system is automatically cruel- but if one can afford the price, it's lovely to err on the side of caution with a larger system and frankly I'm waiting for a sale to upgrade my own systems because they seem a bit cramped and I consider my fish pets (an end to itself) as opposed to a means of fertilizing my plants."

If someone could show me that they feel discomfort or pain - like a cow being improperly treated by a farmer for example - then I would definitely consider changing my setup. As I was buying my fish, there was also a 5 year old buying fish. I am 100% positive my goldfish will have a much better life. EDIT: I'd like to point out that when the USA sends wheat to poor African countries, no one complains that we didn't send steak and lobster. These fish live 200 to a 20 gallon at Petsmart. I think their life will be just fine living 6 to a 5 gallon. Small, yes. But they were bred to die and be repurchased any way. The fact that I won't intentionally kill them and will try my best to balance their needs is good enough for me. I just think it's cool that I built such a thing that works on the principle of ""aquaponics"", and I think turtles in polluted lakes (and occasionally whales and dolphins in the Ocean) have it worse."

Now granted you seem to have some very small comet goldfish fry in there. So I would go 1 fish, per 5 gallons until they reach about 2 inches long. Then you need to switch to 1 fish per 20 gallons. I fully realize this seems like overkill, but goldfish need a lot of space. Especially comet, they swim a lot, they make A LOT OF POOPS.   You also need really intense water flow, a heater, and a metric shit-ton of oxygenation. The rule of thumb there is 80 degree water preferably, and a filter (in your case a pump for your aqua system) rated for double the size of the tank.   Edit: also at that size you need to do a 100% water change at MINIMUM once a week. And you also need to do full spectrum testing every day. Or it is very likely you'll wake up with dead fish."

aquaponics,2xplvz,MsRenee,1 point,Tue Mar 3 18:09:24 2015 UTC,"20 gallons per goldfish. Like is that due to ammonia or territory or swim space etc? Also water changes. In a straight up aquarium setup I found I had to change water or fish died on a regular basis if I didn't (forced work travel w/o being able to find a fish sitter etc) but in an aquaponics setup with a lot of media and filters, I haven't changed my water in a few years (aside from toppin it off with treated water) and haven't had any die offs etc."
aquaponics,2xplvz,MadameInternet,2,Tue Mar 3 19:23:17 2015 UTC,"My feeling is that all fish ought to have a tank at least 3x their body length to allow them to swim and generally go about being fish.  Active river fish like goldies ought to have 4x body length.  That would be a 4 foot aquarium for a full-grown individual.  After you've got the living space taken care of, you can worry about nitrogenous waste buildup.  Whatever your situation is, you need to be able to keep those wastes low enough that they don't affect your fish's health.  In my experience, that cutoff is 40 ppm nitrate, although that's debated, especially in this subreddit.  If you've got enough plants to keep the waste from 7 goldfish under 40 ppm in a 50 gallon, that's how many fish you can have.  If you've got a ton of fast-growing plants that can handle the waste from 15 goldfish, that's going to be your max.  At some point, the fish can't swim without running into each other, but I feel like that's a judgement call most people will be able to make."

As far as water changes go goldfish are weird. They are very prone to constipation, which most often looks like swim bladder issues. And is a lot easier to manage with regular water changes. they also produce...I mean an absolutely incredible amount of waste, so often even with aquaponics it is IMPOSSIBLE to get rid of the nitrates without water changes.

Aquaponics isn't really about growing aquatic plants; it's about using methods of directing the water to grow traditionally non-aquatic plants. You don't really need AP methods to grow an aquatic plant, you would just put it in your tank water with the fish. They're happy like that. The key to learning how to grow any plant is researching the natural environment of the organism. As far as I understand, a lotus is an aquatic plant with an anchor and a surface float, so you could just put it right in your fish tank. I don't think they need mud, but they do need a dense medium to anchor into at their base. I would chose a different plant for use in your AP project, one that is terrestrial. That's the magic of AP - stuff that you'd think only likes dirt will still grow like crazy without it! The peace lily might work well - I know they like moist soil with good drainage.

UVI uses this approach..  to produce exactly what you said... manipulation of nitrates...  By varying the periodic cleaning of the netting.... they can adjust their nitrate levels in the system...  It's a cheap and nasty approach to nitrate control.. and totally un-necessary.. and counter-productive in a commercial plant growing operation.... IMO...  It is not ""mineralisation""...  The adopted it when they removed their solids removal by drum filter... and did so more to regulate their nitrate levels for the RAS... more than for anything else...  An anaerobic approach results in ""denitrification"".. (as you suggested)... which breaks down the nitrates.. and ultimately results in Nitrous Oxide, methane and Hydrogen Sulphide off-gassing... (not fish friendly)  It is essentially.. as are all anaerobic processes... the decomposition.. and end point recycling of wastes...  Anaerobic digestion has NO place in AP systems...

Plants grow great in them, and they have a HUGE surface area.  They're unstoppable as a biofilter.  The pH has been a total killer though.  Honestly, I can't recommend them to anyone new to AP based on this.  It took me almost a year to get the pH to drop down.  In the meantime, all my attempts at pH balancing did were kill about 80% of the fish because of the fluctuations.  I ended up moving all the fish to a separate tank with a sponge filter in it to keep them alive.  I bought a $60 RO Buddy on Amazon and spent about 3 months doing 10% water changes with RO water about 2 - 3 times a week.  I added powdered ammonia during this time to keep the biofilter going and used DynaGrow to for the other nutrients.  I used HCl in copious amounts to drive the pH as low as I could.  Basically, I was running a hydro system.  After the 3 months of water changes and additions, the pH magically stabilized at 7.2 where it currently has been sitting for the last 2 months.  All in all, I think I used 1/4 pound of ammonia, a half quart of DynaGrow, and 1.5 quarts of HCl over the course of a year.  All for a single 50 gallon grow bed.  Insane.  All that said, things are now growing great.  I just have to supplement with a little iron.  4 tomato plants growing happily along with about 15 lettuce plants that will come out soon to give the tomatoes more room.  Knowing what I know now, I might still have used them.

But they weren't doing a great job of making their point clear so I'll give it a go.  Plants absorb Nitrates, and therefore will interfere with your readings while you are trying to cycle your tank, so fish should always come first. Wether doing fishless (recommended) or with fish cycling, either way you don't want any plants so that your readings of ammonia nitrite and nitrate are always accurate. If you see ammonia go down, nitrite up, then both down and nitrate up, you know you've got a good colony of bacteria and you are ready to add plants. But if you already had plants in the system, you would not see those nitrates rise, because the plants would absorb them as soon as they became available. So you might question if you are properly cycled.  Hope that helps."

Nitrates are created by feeding your fish, and the concentration will go to zero if you have no fish or other source of nitrogen.  Plants will absorb and use the nitrate constantly. It's the N in NPK, the 3 macronutrients all plants need.  As the plants grow and you harvest them, you will remove the nitrates from the system.  Some systems, once fully established, will register zero nitrates. This is fine as long as the plants are doing well: it just means they are using everything that is available to them immediately."

aquaponics,2xaiuj,Krystal907,4,Sat Feb 28 01:32:16 2015 UTC,"Ammonia is crapped out by fish. Bacteria turn the ammonia (NH4) into nitrite (NO2-). Other types of bacteria turn that nitrite (NO2-) into nitrate (NO3-). Plants use that nitrate as fertilizer and remove it. If there are no plants, it will accumulate in the water. This is why regular fish tanks need water changes. If you just have water sitting there, the existing ammonia will convert to nitrate and then stop once the ammonia is gone. It only keeps accumulating because fish keep adding more ammonia. A frequently overlooked nutrient that fish also provide is soluble reactive phosphorous, which is used directly by plants - no bacteria step.  Also, you shouldn't have plants in your system if it's not cycled. Get the water happy first. You should add your biofilter immediately because you want beneficial bacteria to grow. This is key to cycling a tank. Then add fish. Once the system is stable with fish, THEN add plants."

People do DSM to keep nitrates at a minimum and ensure no algal growth. In DSM you have to fertilize the water until fish are added. In AP, you add the plants last because they are interacting with the end byproducts of the fish. Without the fish, a planted bed will suck the nutrients dry, requiring you to fertilize the tank just like in DSM, and is essentially hydroponics. Adding nutrients can also cause nitrite spikes and delay proper cycling if added improperly. So in AP it's easier and more logical to get the fish added first - this way you don't ever have to worry about your plants getting nutrients and ensure quick tank cycling."

aquaponics,2xbu05,Toriningen,2,Fri Feb 27 06:43:27 2015 UTC,Water change is the real solution but it seems like you know that. Otherwise I would do basically what you lay out. Filter the sediment out somehow. Not sure if its in your budget but you can put in an additional in line pool/spa filter. That will need to be cleaned A LOT until your water is clear. Anything can filter out fine sediments is going to cause a backup in your system. Its was hard to tell from your picture but is your system getting a lot of sun? That can lead to buildup of brown algae which might be the cause of your blockage.
aquaponics,2xbu05,pooppate,1 point,Fri Feb 27 14:33:17 2015 UTC,Yes it does get sun: it's in a greenhouse. Didnt know algae could be green. A lot of it just seems like mud.

aquaponics,2wufdd,in-site,8,Mon Feb 23 05:54:38 2015 UTC,A floating raft is really good for leafy greens. If I were you (and you have the space) I would construct a system that uses both a grow bed and a floating raft set up.  The grow bed is still important because it provides surface area for the bacterial colony to thrive.  In a floating raft (at small scale) is harder to provide the right conditions for the bacteria.  You can also use the grow bed as a kind of particle filter if you add worms to it.  They eat the gunk and you can treat your fish to then periodically!
aquaponics,2wufdd,skuba,2,Mon Feb 23 11:55:30 2015 UTC,"This is by far the most complete and comprehensive answer I've seen so far. Thank you! What kinds of things do worms need to live? I assume they're unhappy in leca/hydroton balls? Are there fully aquatic, helpful worms?"
aquaponics,2wufdd,skuba,3,Mon Feb 23 17:40:11 2015 UTC,"Red wiggler worms can be found at any bait/tackle shop in the states.  Dont just go out and get any old earth worm as they might harbor things you dont want getting in your system.  They will do fine in clay pellets which is what I'd suggest you fill your grow media with anyway.  They are round, porous, and dont degrade over time giving the bacteria a ton of space to grow in.  The worms will feed off of the detritus in the bed as well as eat dead root systems so they really are a great deal.  in addition the population will self-stabilize based on how much food is available.  They are not aquatic but tolerate being submerged for a while, for instance in a flood/drain bed.  If you are into closing loops in the system, as I am, I'd tell you to also consider adding scuds (tiny freshwater shrimp) to the system.  The scuds are also detritus eating animals and are a tasty treat for your fish.  In addition, If you have leftovers frequently in the form of carrots/potatoes and the like you might also want to consider breeding mealworms.  They reproduce quickly and easily and fish love them.  There are a bunch of great videos on youtube.  Just use search terms like the ones I mentioned here.  In addition THIS GUY has a ton of excellent videos I would encourage you/anyone to check out."
aquaponics,2wufdd,Optimoprimo,2,Mon Feb 23 18:14:33 2015 UTC,"Red worms work fine. They just wriggle through the hydroton. As long as you aren't constant flood and you provide an inch or so above the highest water level, they won't drown. One thing that wasn't mentioned is that the worms defecate in the media as well, and that can contribute to solids buildup. It requires that you clean out your growbed ~yearly, which you should do anyway."
aquaponics,2wufdd,LadyDarkKitten,2,Mon Feb 23 18:16:34 2015 UTC,"I currently live and work on a hydroponic farm that uses PVC pipes as the grow ""beds"". I did not build the system I just use it. If you're growing plants that are very vertically orientated, like a romaine lettuce then you have to watch out for flop. Because the pipes aren't flat on top the netpots tend to shift, this causes tall plants to flop over. Which stresses the plant and causes twisting and stretching at the least, at the worst if you're pipe isn't properly secured all those plants flopping around can cause the pipe to roll over and dump your harvest. OUCH! Short fat plants don't have this problem.  If you're growing for personal use the flop isn't such a problem, the plants wont be pretty but they are still edible. The advantage to PVC pipe is that they are easy to clean. Just get pipes that are a size or two up, make a little stand, seal and fill said pipes with a hot bleach mix (I think 10% is standard) then slide the used pipe into the mix and let sit over night. Rinse with a hose and reuse.  Question about your indoor grow, you are making sure to have proper air flow yes? Little fans or something? Other wise your plants are going to be weak and unable to hold themselves up."
aquaponics,2wsppy,TriumphantAardvark,1 point,Sun Feb 22 21:10:31 2015 UTC,"So is this a tower or are you cutting the pipe in half to make a horizontal bed? Uniseals work great but I've never put them in a curve as steep and rigid as 6"" PVC. The other thing is if you do try it I would fit PVC in the uniseal and then fit the ebb and flow fitting to the pvc. I don't know from experience, but it looks to me like the ebb and flow wouldn't fit in the uniseal well enough to prevent leaks. Also it can be tough to push your pipe through a uniseal, the abs plastic or whatever it is on the ebb and flow might break.  If it were me I would just a usecuniseal and a pvc pipe. Cap the pvc  pipe and cut slits perpandicular to the pipe creating a siv similar to the one in the ebb and flow piece. Like the top pipe in this this image."

There's a lot less water, to begin with, and they don't start dying if the pump goes out."
aquaponics,2wnckj,velacreations,1 point,Mon Feb 23 14:44:23 2015 UTC,Why does a lower stocking density increase the size of the system.. don't understand?  And as far as reducing the amount of plants per system.... I totally disagree...  Most people have no idea how few fish are needed to produce copious amounts of veges

aquaponics,2wnckj,eternalfrost,1 point,Sat Feb 21 23:31:14 2015 UTC,"not really, plants can survive many hours if your pump fails, and you can hand water if needed.  If you have a medium that holds a bit of moisture, they can last days.  Fish?  not so much. a few hours at most."

aquaponics,2wnckj,Canucklehead99,3,Sat Feb 21 15:07:38 2015 UTC,"I have to take /u/mukwic 's side on this one. I grow fruiting tomatoes in my 20 gallon and 250 Gallon system with hydroton and goldfish. What you said about water quality is untrue. Phosphate and nitrates (via ammonia) are what the fish provide, both of which can be in generous concentrations without harming the fish. The disconnect is what pH is preferred; most plants prefer a lower pH than the fish, but this is easily reconcilable by keeping fish that are more pH tolerant. Goldfish do just fine around 6.8 - 7."
aquaponics,2wnckj,Optimoprimo,2,Sat Feb 21 19:58:38 2015 UTC,I'm backing you guys on this one. I've grown tomatoes in a very small setup in an apartment. They tasted way better than hydroponic tomatoes.

aquaponics,2wnckj,Spitinthacoola,2,Sat Feb 21 20:50:49 2015 UTC,"I'd say hydro is the safer bet because you have specific, granular control over your nutrients etc. In AP you only have somewhat indirect control over the nutrients for your plants through the fish.  As you add in more layers between input and output of food to plants it will get more complex to balance the two.  Another complexity with aquaponics is that you have to worry about the health of your fish as well as the health of your plants. Horticulture is a complex field and so is fish biology. Are you prepared to study, study and study some more two distinct and seperate fields of science?  I would probably say that you will probably experience some level of failure no matter what you do when you start out in projects like hydro / aquaponics as you would with traditional gardening. The key is knowing and preparing for what might go wrong and learning the signs and how to fix what went wrong."
aquaponics,2wnckj,denjin,1 point,Sat Feb 21 21:26:42 2015 UTC,"Bioponics, the non sterile hydroponics, is likely to be better than both.  Plants can survive longer periods without power than fish."

aquaponics,2wlf7i,NorthAtlanticGarden,2,Fri Feb 20 22:16:25 2015 UTC,First things first: you need a source of heat that doesn't break your pocket. And and properly insulated shed.
aquaponics,2wlf7i,Pastelitomaracucho,2,Sat Feb 21 06:36:30 2015 UTC,Up here the standard way of heating is with Oil and some people are transitioning to using heat pumps for heating up rooms. Afaik both options are expensive and the one more expensive. My idea is to build a burner for Old frying oil and collecting the oil from restaurants around the country. It should be possible due to the government taking quite a big fee for getting rid of the old cooking oil. I could stockpile it in the summer and use it in the winter. It's a solution and as long as i'm using vegetable oil it should be CO2 neutral.
aquaponics,2wlf7i,Pastelitomaracucho,1 point,Sat Feb 21 19:30:12 2015 UTC,Cool! Then then next step is calculating how much heat you will need and that will give you an idea of the amount of oil you can stockpile. Even using a heat exchanger can help you recover lots of heat during a water exchange. And of course you could upgrade the system so the daily water exchange is minimal...
aquaponics,2wlf7i,TheChonk,2,Sat Feb 21 20:03:25 2015 UTC,"I am at the same stage as you - planning home-scale AP in Ireland so similar weather too. My experience might be useful since I am only one (or half even) step ahead of you. Bear my lack of practical AP experience in mind. In my favour, I am a keen gardener in soil, in hydroponics and under lights, and a professional environmental scientist.  Have been doing a lot of reading about AP. There are a lot of free guidebooks and manuals out there (barrelponics, the IBC of aquaponics). The best all-rounder I have found so far is the recent FAO production see link below. Bear in mind that its aimed at warmer climates, so ya gotta temper it with some of the guidance given by cold weather AP man FrostyFish - look up his comments on this subreddit and his website/blog its really good - maybe even buy one of his plans (only $10) if appropriate for you.   I have been looking for a food-safe IBC for a few weeks now without luck - there are loads 2nd hand but all with unclear previous contents so unless I luck out I will have to buy from new at €330 for 2 is the best deal I can get. I am also investigating stock (cattle) tanks (already plumbed but so far, all expensive) and 1000l or 1500L tree pots (see for example http://www.dekerhort.ie/pdf/2015/grower-products-containers-pots/tree-containers-2015.pdf). The fishing or other industries near you might have other types of tanks that suit? Just make sure they are food safe and previous contents too.  Then your next thing might be growing media which seems to be simplest for a starter like me and you - clay pebbles seem to be ideal but cost a lot - might be €3-400 for my IBC plan. Lava rock pebbles of some types are used - your local type might suit? I'm looking for washed and graded pea pebbles of granite or other non-limestone rock. Might be hard to get on Faroe? Have not yet found a good alternative in Dublin yet.    Then for fish, I'd say you should stick to what fish already grow locally - both to protect from invasive species and because flying stock in will cost. So brown trout definitely if you can keep the oxygen up and water clean(ish) but also consider perch or carp if you can get locally. Goldfish would also do (not native, I know, so don't release them), not for eating but, the fish are usually a secondary product after the plants.   Fish meal might suit as feed but check it out carefully unless it is produced as a fish feed as opposed to fertiliser etc. Your fish feed is the primary driver input so it must be right. Then focus on the leafy green plants first (kale, rocket, mustard) and leave the fruiting types (tomato, chili) til you get experienced - they are forgiving plants that work in cold. And if you really want to get into it, start growing plants in soil right now - don't have to wait for the AP system to get experience going. And you will then have plants ready to start transplanting whenever you get AP going next month or next year - all experience counts.   I am going to avoid having to heat my system, for sustainability as well as cost, by keeping it enclosed - our climate is cool but not truly cold like elsewhere (assuming Faroe weather = Irelands?) - and it is light that counts for many plants - you will have long summer days like us - with lots of light - no worries there. Winter will be a challenge to keep sufficient plants and active bio-filtration volume going. I am trying to figure out running sufficient lighting to keep the AP going through winter. leafy veg need less intense light so it might work out OK. Plus my HID light gives off heat so plant are balmy under it.  Finally, keep an eye on this sub - the posts and comments and discussions are great and helpful.  Thats my thinking right now. (Jesus, just realized its a wall of text! I hope its all right!! Comments welcome.)   Heres that FAO link: http://www.fao.org/3/contents/1dea3c92-1faa-47bb-a374-0cf4d9874544/i4021e00.htm  PS going to Copenhagen on Thursday night for 1 night - wheres good to go?"
aquaponics,2wlf7i,TheChonk,1 point,Sun Feb 22 18:18:13 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the answer. As for tanks and such, I'm not even close to getting to a design as of yet. I would probably use stainless steel plates and weld it together and use it for the fish.. Then use pvc for the piping. And run it using NFT.. As for Copenhagen I'm not really from that part of the country :-/"
aquaponics,2wlf7i,TheChonk,1 point,Wed Feb 25 05:47:18 2015 UTC,"My last reply was from when I was at work. Let me give you a longer answer. My idea was to use fish storage and waste containers for the setup, they are like big green tanks made of plastic, they use them at my workplace for storing throwaway fish, the tanks themselves has a holes in the corners with a plug and a thread, so I guess I could easily use them for the fishes atleast, and the tanks are stackable and movable with a forklift. What are the weather conditions where you live in regards to sunshine? The sun rarely shines here at this time of the year due to weather being either rainy and snowy or cloudy. But I definatly need to use artificial lighting, and I have been brainstorming and come to the conclusion that I could built a hydro electric powerplant for my purposes by utilising a local river.."
aquaponics,2wlf7i,highflyer83,1 point,Sat Feb 28 08:05:15 2015 UTC,"Those tanks sound like they might work, since they are (presumably) food safe already.  Weather in Dublin never really stays below 0c for a long time - snow seldom sticks for 24 hours if it does fall. In my garden this winter I had chard onions and garlic grow right through. I also over wintered tomato and chili plants in an unheated conservatory and some have even started to grow already in February - so winters are a bit grey and cool and low light but growth does not come to a complete halt in the natural light. That small bit of growth might not be enough to sustain fish and bacteria will also be slower. Artificial light would definitely help - I have jalapeño chili ready to pick under HID light now even though it gets cool when light goes off at night. Building hydropower seems pretty complicated to simply supply electricity for lights and heat. My gut feeling would be to design a cold weather system under good glazing (if you have it) and insulation to maximise natural light in those long summer days that are coming. A lot of plants just need light not heat to grow, and you should have 6 months of good light. That gets you started cheaper and learning and buys you time to add the extra complexity of winter lighting.   Copenhagen was great. Going out to collect my 2 IBCs this morning!"

The problem is that grid power here is extremely expensive here.. its 2 kroner per kWh. Which is like 0.26 Eur for one kWh..

I think people freak out just a little too much about goldfish. Especially in systems where you are going to have tons of plants removing nitrates, going a little over the limit required by the goldfish police is just fine. It's more about common sense and keeping an eye on your water chemistry. I have 2 goldfish and a snail in my system and my ammonia is always 0 and nitrates never get over 50 (this is a bit lower than ideal). If they did start to creep up or I had other issues, I'd adjust my fish load. If you're really not feeling the nice cheap goldfish route, here is a list of other coldwater fish: http://www.theaquariumwiki.com/Coldwater_Aquariums  Heating a recirculating system is a pain because the water cools as it circulates.

Only one is planted with a few basil plants. Another has pepper seedlings, and I am growing other seedlings to be moved into the system later. Bell siphons in two of the beds, with pvc connections to the others using a ball valve and threaded joint so I can remove the front two planters for cleaning the aquarium. Additionally, a DIY pvc overflow into the sump. I am running two eheim 2213s as well for solid filtration, which also do the pumping up to the beds. Stock right now is 3 black veil angels, several small plecos, and assorted small cichlids.   I know it's not ideal, but I'm using it to learn and experiment while I am stuck in an apartment. Ultimate goal would be to build larger custom tanks once I am in a house and of course separate the planted tank from the AP.   I am battling deficiencies left and right with the plants, as I'm sure you could have guessed, but I suppose my priority is keeping cleaner water in the aquarium so it looks nice, and still seeing how far I can push it in terms of growing.

aquaponics,2we2wb,Optimoprimo,1 point,Thu Feb 19 14:29:11 2015 UTC,"It's worth noting not all aquatic plants pull their nutrients from the water column.   Some do, but many pull from the substrate.  Substrates either need replaced or buffered with root tabs for rooted aquatic plants.  Plans like Anubias pull from the water column.  But we're not talking vicious amounts of nitrate to keep anubias growing strong.  Aside from that, plants help balance the tanks ecosystem.  They provide O2.  Co2 induction helps maintain a steady pH.  Generally speaking, having plants in the aquarium not only helps stabilize an aquarium, but it reduces fish stress allowing them to eat and digest food year round and in good amounts.  Aiming for a specific nitrate ppm can still be accomplished as with any other AP, it would simply require the slightest bit more feed to maintain nitrate level that any particular system is interested in maintaining.  This might not be scalable to the thousands of gallons for a host of not really feed related issues.  I'd say scalability would be the limiting factor here.   Edit: http://i.imgur.com/4fhxZSH.jpg   2 pinches of over the counter flake food a day.  Nitrates stay at 0 as the java fern and star grass eats up the excess.  The point is, there are a lot of plants here growing for the amount of food I put in the system.  They aren't all growing from the water column."

Haha tried dhg, failed. Tried dwarf baby tears, failed. The micro swords began propagating, and then halted fairly abruptly.   Edit: I also tend to be fairly anal about vacuuming the substrate because it just turns a disgusting brown color. This probably isn't helping either. You have some great ground cover there.

aquaponics,2we2wb,Optimoprimo,1 point,Thu Feb 19 19:39:24 2015 UTC,"A lot of the plants you mention require good lighting and CO2.   Baby Tears are cool looking, but with such small roots they are easily dominated by pretty much any other carpeting plants unless physically separated.    If you are using Eco Complete I wouldn't vacuum the fish effluent out as Eco Complete is innert. It's basically just a grow media. The effluent will work it's way into the substrate and serve to provide nutrients to your plants.  My 20 long is more than 2 years old and I've only vacuumed the substrate once due to a bunch of the fish poo settling in a small area potentially creating an anaerobic situation.   More water flow solved that problem.  Good light, root tabs, high protein fish foods, consistent CO2 levels.  Boom, it's a jungle in there.  Some people even make their own root tabs on the cheap.  Google can help with that, probably even Reddit.  On mobile or I'd point you in a more precise spot."
aquaponics,2we838,DrugFreeBoy,1 point,Thu Feb 19 04:07:15 2015 UTC,"So what I have envisioned:  IBC tote cut up in the typical manner for a media bed & fish tank,  with the addition of a few things.   Water starts at FT (elevated by cinder blocks).   Flows through siphon into gravity fed swirl filter (will gravity be enough to power it?).   Overflows into sump (basic storage container that also has an emergency overflow from FT that bypasses filter).   Sump contains pump which raises current to top of (vinyl gutter) NFT.   Flow continues down NFT,  until spilling out into media bed controlled by a bell siphon. (would the slow flow of the NFT be too slow for the media bed?).   Any and all suggestions welcomed!   Thane r/aqaponics for getting me hooked!"
aquaponics,2we838,Whittigo,2,Thu Feb 19 04:19:36 2015 UTC,"Flow rate for the NFT should be fine, just put ball valves on everything so you can adjust as needed. The main thing you want to think about is solids filtration. Gravity will be enough for your filter, either swirl or radial flow, but you might want to either raise the fish tank more, or sink the sump tank into the ground a bit, and try for your swirl filter then one more filter if you can manage it, maybe with some filter media in there. You want to eliminate as many solids as you can. The grow bed can handle some solids with a good red worm population, but the NFT tubes will become filthly.  My current system has no filtration and my NFT tubes are disgusting. I plan on putting in a radial flow and then some kind of media filter in once it warms up enough I can take everything out of the greenhouse. Better to start with as much filtration as you can manage rather than deal with the mess I have to clean up when I rebuild."
aquaponics,2we838,Whittigo,1 point,Thu Feb 19 14:41:34 2015 UTC,"Something more like this?  Added some more elevation to the FT, so it has room to go through both a radial/media filter.  I figured i'd be better off splitting the pump line:once into the NFT,  one to the media bed, and the last back into the FT for extra aeration.   A tap for the radial to flush it out, and an emergency overflow for the sump during the rain.  I saw you're in Norther Floridian as well, any specific location advice you might have to pass along?"
aquaponics,2we838,snohmann,1 point,Thu Feb 19 19:50:27 2015 UTC,"I'd send it all back to the fish tank, let it all go through the filters again rather than back into the sump. And you don't have to split it 3 ways if you don't want to, or run out of pipe, NFT to grow beds should be fine, you can play with the size and configuration of the bell siphon to get it to start and stop draining at different flow rates. Otherwise looks like a good plan, no doubt you'll rebuild in a year like everyone else after learning what works for you, but it looks to be a much better design than I started with. What kind of total volume/number of fish are you thinking? The one advice I wish I would have had starting out is assume at least a 2:1 grow bed to tank ratio. Lots of places online say 1:1 is fine, but if you are trying to grow fish and plants, 2:1 is bare minimum for the amount of food you need to give your fish to grow them at a good rate. Fish poop a lot. If you are going with just goldfish or something, you can alter your feed rate to match how quickly you use up the nitrates.  As for North Florida tips, I ordered my tialpia fingerlings online, but I saw on craigslist there was a guy in Waldo selling them for cheaper, just a bit of a drive. Not sure if its still listed there. I was very pleasantly surprised that I was able to grow lettuce in full Florida summer sun in my NFT tubes, the constant hydration kept them from dying, I could never get them to grow in that kind of heat in the ground. They definitely were very limp when I came home on a warm sunny day, but if you harvest in the morning they are nice and crisp. I recommend Tropicana lettuce seeds from Johnnys, heat tolerant variety that are very tasty.  I don't have an overflow pipe on my system, but I will probably put one in the sump when I rebuild. I asked around here and most people just did not worry about too much rain overflowing. Of course most people dont live in Florida. I had mine uncovered for a while, then I put up clear plastic roof tiles for a while, but some parts uncovered as well. Never really saw a problem with water levels even with heavy rain, so don't worry about that so much. Even if it overflows it's just going to overflow the sump, not like fish are in there to worry about."
aquaponics,2we838,glennvtx,1 point,Thu Feb 19 20:08:20 2015 UTC,"for the gutters you could run the water at the speed required to start the bell siphon. i had gutters in a similar setup and i grew lettuces and herbs in them, also algea... i should mention that if your gutters dont have some kind of cap for baskets to hang on (essentially making a tube) your grow media will have to allow that flow as well. with open tops and baskets of grow media sitting in the gutters you will generate algea where ever light hits water. one other thing i will add is the emergency overflow is going to be running all the time due to the siphon (depending on pipe diameter of course) is going to have a higher flow rate than your sump pump. i should ask though, how far up are you trying to pump and what kind of gallons per hour your pump does? and whats the wattage?"
aquaponics,2w7vsa,Optimoprimo,2,Tue Feb 17 18:33:08 2015 UTC,"Really awesome setup, what lighting system are you using? What was your reasoning for including the carp as your fish? I am new to aquaponics and would love to hear about the nutrients that your fish provide your plants. Do you clean the tanks eventually?"
aquaponics,2w7vsa,Joe2710,2,Tue Feb 17 19:26:04 2015 UTC,"I have a very aggressive filtration system; you can see that my pump is attached to an undergravel filter. This filter pumps into a reservoir that has bio media inside it. The white thing on the right is another bag of bio media. All this pretty much takes care of any waste by bacterial decomposition. I'll have to use a gravel siphon on the solids occasionally, but it will be like a few times a year at most. I'm using just a cheap fluorescent grow bulb reflected with aluminum foil. The nicer bulbs just allow you to have the light further away but for my system it is fine. I used goldfish because they are cheap, don't get too big (compared to koi or tilapia etc.) and don't require warm water. Heating an AP system can be a pain in the ass because the water gets to room temp while it circulates. I find one of the best ways to start this stuff is to just learn how aquariums work. Learn about the nitrogen cycle and beneficial bacteria. Learn about the living requirements of fish species. Understand why algae grows. Once you understand aquariums, then the AP stuff is easy because its just taking that water and running it over a plant bed. The nutrient chemistry stays the same."
aquaponics,2w7vsa,MrMalamat,2,Tue Feb 17 21:02:37 2015 UTC,"I love when these microsystems work out. Although the chemistry focuses on some very different variables than an aquarium.  For instance, you have to pay particular attention to soluble ions in the solution and their availability to the plants.  Iron must be in the form of ferrous ions, which tend to favor development under anaerobic conditions.  In aquaponics, where the entire system may be aerobic, the iron will exist in the ferric form.  This is where chelating compounds come into use. An iron chelator will bind to the ferric iron, making more soluble and available for uptake through the roots. So be ready to diagnose deficiencies. Try introducing a couple crayfish to work on the solids buildup."
aquaponics,2w7vsa,MrMalamat,2,Wed Feb 18 01:07:28 2015 UTC,"That's a very good point, but still I think it's a good base to build on. I actually have an auto-analyzer at work that reads iron, so I do slip in a water sample from my system once and a while to monitor soluble iron. I've never really had an issue but I know it's a common problem. I'm unfamiliar with the excretion rate of crayfish and given that I already have 2 goldfish in the system, I don't want to overwhelm the nutrient load. Are they heavy producers of waste?"
aquaponics,2w7vsa,Joe2710,1 point,Wed Feb 18 03:17:40 2015 UTC,"From what I've read, not really. However, most of its anecdotal, I can't cite any credible resources.    How does your analyzer work? Like conductivity? I'm trying to assemble a decent personal set of testing equipment, I just don't want to spend hundreds..."
aquaponics,2w7vsa,Coinnut92,3,Wed Feb 18 03:27:02 2015 UTC,"I'm a biogeochemist at a local university. An autoanalyzer is a piece of analytical chemistry equipment that costs nearly $100k. It actually works by combustion of the liquid and then reading the light spectrum of the flame. It's definitely overkill, but it doesn't cost us much to add one extra sample in a run. For you I know there are testing strips for iron out there that are dirt cheap, I just don't know how precise they are. The only other thing I know of are these kits which are very accurate and precise, but are pricey and are really just made for field work."

aquaponics,2w7vsa,Coinnut92,1 point,Wed Feb 18 04:16:52 2015 UTC,"While goldfish are cheap, they certainly aren't small. Assuming you got the cheapest goldfish at petsmart or your local equivalent, you likely have comets, which can reach a very healthy 12"" long at maturity. Contrary to popular belief, they don't ""grow to the size of the bowl"" either. At best the live out short miserable lives in cramped conditions as their organs outgrow their bodies. I understand using cheap fish, but I recommend looking into other species that will be much better suited for your setup. Feel free to PM me and I'd be happy to suggest a few possible species."
aquaponics,2w7vsa,Joe2710,2,Wed Feb 18 02:07:53 2015 UTC,"don't get too big (compared to koi or tilapia etc.)   In other words, they were the smallest option for what I plan to do with them. Yes, goldfish do grow. To an optimistic 12 inches, and I've seen many healthy 3-4 year old goldfish in large aquariums nowhere near that. I'm not going to use some overpriced ornamental that doesn't produce the waste I need. Sorry, but in the end a 12 cent fish is just a better value and it will take years for them to outgrow what I have set up for them. And there's only 2. I've done my math. Also, this is only my indoor bedroom system and once they outgrow it, they have a nice home in a 250 gallon that will probably be even larger in the far off future when they become enormous. I have started to get irritated by all this goldfish overreaction in fish-related subreddits.. I mean they're feeder fish for crying outloud, most of them end their lives getting bitten in half by turtles and people are losing their minds when someone puts more than 1 in a 20 gallon as a pet. It's better than a bowl, isn't it?"
aquaponics,2w7vsa,MrMalamat,2,Wed Feb 18 03:08:51 2015 UTC,"I understand the assumed economic benefit of 12 cent fish, I really do. It just isn't an ideal situation for the fish. If cared for properly it will outgrow that tank in a year. I'm glad you have a larger system for it to go into, and in that aspect it's great. Grow him out and add him to the other system later. But many people don't have the forethought or means to do this. And yes, a 20 gallon is better than most get, but it's basically the difference between never being able to leave the bedroom and never leaving your apartment, better, but still not great."

The fish get a spoon full of flakes 3 times a day, soon to be automatic hopefully.  The lights and air-pump are on a 18hr on cycle. The lighting consists of two t5 florescent lights for the plants and one 6500k CFL for the fish.  The submersible pump cycles water to each of the plants for 1min every other hour. And drains right back into the tank.  I also put in a small filter to cut down on how often I need to change the water. Once a week I empty out about 2-3 gallons and replace it with 5 gallon of fresh water with conditioner. I use two of those blue 5 gal. water jugs and a siphon, it makes changing the water pretty easy.  And as for the plants, Half are Skywalker OG, and the other half is LA Confidential."
aquaponics,2w823m,MrMalamat,2,Tue Feb 17 19:19:04 2015 UTC,"Nice setup. Looking at the tank gravel, without a flow through the gravel you'll have solids accumulating under mostly anaerobic conditions. This isn't exactly bad, as the anaerobic digestion will make additional nutrients available to the plants. However, this will also release hydrogen sulfide. I would recommend leaving an air stone in the tank running 24/7, to degas your solution. Also, complete, aerobic, and efficient nitrification will be limited if water is only flowing over the limited surface area of the pots. With your system as is, some water changes are inevitable but you should aim for uninterrupted recirculation. Also, buy blunts by the box."
aquaponics,2w6yoy,Mike_Le_Watt,3,Tue Feb 17 14:13:09 2015 UTC,"You still need to follow the general rules of AP, regardless of size. Sand is a horrible media for growing because it has no drainage and gets carried away by the movement of water and clogs everything. Cactus don't like being soaked in water all the time, so they're out. Use small river rock or hydroton for media. Wheat grass would work well.. most of us aren't going to know much about ornamental plants to use in the system - kind of the point is to grow vegetables. You could get away with herbs like cilantro or basil as well. Also, you might want to abandon the idea of a  recirculating system and just have the roots grow into the top of the water like a raft. In that case you could get hydroponic growing cups and put media with the plant in those.. having the bottom just touching your water. Use the pump for filtration/aeration. A recirculating system that small is going to need components that unnecessarily take up space. Finally, snails make sense; also little shrimp are nice because they clean when they feed."
aquaponics,2w6yoy,Optimoprimo,1 point,Tue Feb 17 14:37:31 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the advice. Sand is a no no in that case. You mentioned hydroton, could  crushed hydroton work? I have tons of the stuff (building a full size system currently) and the hydroton balls are quite large-good for a giant grow bed. Perhaps something artificial? Plastic/glass beads?  Wheat grass sounds good. Shrimp sound good as well, I hope they aren't cannibalistic though.  Thanks for the advice."
aquaponics,2w6yoy,Optimoprimo,1 point,Tue Feb 17 14:46:47 2015 UTC,"If your growbed is so small that hydroton would be too large, then your growbed is just too small, imo. I'd worry about crushing it because there will be tiny fragments that will function just like the sand. Maybe it will work, I've never done it. That's why I was thinking you should just design a raft over the top kind of like this only smaller. This setup is probably using those coconut coir pouches you can buy for cheap. You can trim back the roots if they're unsightly. I've seen plastic beads work, but they are slippery and have little surface area. Plants can't anchor well in them. If you're going to go with that, just use small river rock. At least that's nice and heavy. I've read of people using expanded shale but I have no experience with it. And shrimp will absolutely eat each other if they die, but that's just less clean up for you! Ideally you never have to touch your aquarium."
aquaponics,2w6yoy,Optimoprimo,1 point,Tue Feb 17 15:20:51 2015 UTC,"Ok, that's good about the shrimp, sounds perfect. And I'm assuming size of the tanks won't affect the shrimp in a detrimental way. Small river rock sounds good.  I'm trying to come up with materials that could be easily sourced in large quantities-if this turns out ok, it would be cool to produce some sort of kit.  Thanks for the advice."
aquaponics,2w6yoy,joelTURNDOWNTHETV,1 point,Tue Feb 17 15:45:42 2015 UTC,"Well they have cute little kits like this out there. But if you can make it cheaper I think people would jump on it. These things are always so expensive when the materials cost is probably less than $10. And no, the shrimp stay pretty small and you would only want a couple. Good luck! Post pictures.  Edit: I just remembered something - make sure to put a good screen or mesh around the intake of your pump to disperse the suction - poor little shrimp can get sucked into that shit like Finding Nemo."

At first I toyed with a conventional, large cube, modular design, that would consist for three elements. Fish, plants and insects (crickets). No need to get fish food, you can harvest the plants and even have surplus edible crickets too. This however is far too ambitions so I decided to scale it down.  And yeah, these things are uber expensive for what they are, I don't think the bubble had burst yet either, which is why I would love to make something cheaper.  Thanks again, and will make a note of the mesh. I already have a large roll of it from when i bred crickets."
aquaponics,2w6yoy,guyanonymous,2,Tue Feb 17 16:08:03 2015 UTC,"A lot of good advice here. That being said, don't be too quick to think your ideas won't work. You may be the first here to try something like this, so you will never know unless you experiment. I think crushed hydroton may work, as long as you rinse it well before use. That's just an opinion though. Something else to think about is evaporation will be increased with a recirc system, and with such a small tank it could be a problem over a long weekend."

aquaponics,2w5srw,glennvtx,0,Tue Feb 17 17:40:00 2015 UTC,"Do not use GrowStone.    Reason #1  This is the original MSDS - http://sunlightsupply.s3.amazonaws.com/documents/product/714230_MSDS.pdf  0.5 to 5% is calcium carbonate.  Now to explain HOW bad this is.  Roughly 1 bag of GrowStones is 7 kilograms.  For a test system I needed 5 bags or 35 kilograms of GW.  My test system was ~50-70 gallons.  35 KG * 0.05 is 1.75 kilograms of calcium carbonate.  OR   35 KG * 0.005 is 175 grams.  For reference, very small amounts ( milligrams ) of calcium carbonate will shift the pH of a AP/hydro up .2-.5 degrees.  Reason #2   If you google for GrowStone and do due diligence,  almost everyone who talked about using GrowStone at some point, quietly dropped it later.     If you want, go to their website, check out their snazzy proof of concept ""tests"" and notice known of them mention pH.  tl;dr Do not buy GrowStones, it's a bad product for aquaponics."
aquaponics,2w5srw,zynix,1 point,Sat Feb 28 09:09:16 2015 UTC,"I have no direct experience with growstone, mainly because i could not source it around my area. However, i have spoken with others that have used them, none complained of ph issues, most chose them due to their lower price than hydroton, but everyone i have asked, given the choice, still prefered hydroton. Calcium carbonate is a PH Buffer, which is a desirable thing in AP, It is used in the production of glass (growstone is glass) and most of it is bound forever in said glass, and does not leech into your AP system."
aquaponics,2w5srw,glennvtx,1 point,Sun Mar 1 01:06:43 2015 UTC,"I have no direct experience with growstone   So you do not know what you're talking about but you feel obligated to give an opinion?   i have spoken with others that have used them   I own ~75 pounds of GrowStones and you're arguing with me using anecdotal statements.  I know a guy who swears pigs can fly, that doesn't make it true or even a valid foundation for a contrary opinion.  To be clear I am calling you out as being less than honest.  You have taken a convoluted route to basically saying ""nuh uh"".   Calcium carbonate is a PH Buffer, which is a desirable thing in AP   To some extent, but you're also demonstrating a lack of being informed.  A solution with a high level of calcium carbonate, depending on temperature, has a resting pH above 7.2 but generally around 8.2.  A very good example of this is the ocean which has a pH of ~8.2 and a dissolved CaCO3 of ~200-300ppm ( again because of temperature and other factors it will vary and not all CaCO3 is dissolved ).  Furthermore, pH above 7.0 ( neutral ) has a lot of consequences:  above 7.2 dissolved ammonia forms into ammonium which is the fish version of carbon monoxide and will progressively kill them off; depending on chelated iron used, an alkaline/basic water solution will lock out iron from the plants;  nitrates and phosphates also become less accessible to plants.   It is used in the production of glass (growstone is glass) and most of it is bound forever in said glass, and does not leach into your AP system.   I am going to go out on a limb here and suggest you're just making shit up.  I linked to a copy of the GrowStone MSDS, line item #1 says 99% of it is made of glass.  Additionally I own ~70 pounds of GrowStone.   It is used in the production of glass (growstone is glass)    Calcium carbonate IS NOT USED IN MAKING GLASS.  Maybe you're mistaking calcium oxide CaO or Sodium carbonate Na2 CO3.  Furthermore calcium carbonate is used by GrowStone as a ""natural foaming"" agent http://www.growstone.com/about/products/faq/  .  Unlike you I spent a lot of time reading over GrowStone's website as I am actively working on proving their product is bad for aquaponics.   and most of it is bound forever in said glass, and does not leech into your AP system.   Bound how?  I can't find any chemical equation for any of the various glass compositions and CaCO3   Furthermore if CaCO3 was bound to the soda lime in growstone then it's unlikely to be a pH buffer.  Normally I don't bother arguing with people on the internet but the decision to purchase GrowStone's products is about money,  I have talked to multiple people who were financially set back because of the uninformed decision to buy GrowStones.  Myself included in that group.  I have first hand experience with GrowStones.    You can be resentful or whatever, but don't make stuff up or use anecdotal ""facts"" as a position.  I am going ahead and reposting this conversation to /r/aquaponics to see if there is an informed contrary opinion."
aquaponics,2w5srw,zynix,1 point,Sun Mar 1 03:32:53 2015 UTC,"So you do not know what you're talking about but you feel obligated to give an opinion?   Nice attitude. I have an opinion based on the use of growstone by people in my area. The ""local"" (40 miles away) hydroponics supplier began pushing growstones pretty hard almost 2 years ago, and many people i have met there have been using them successfully. They are much cheaper there than hydroton.   I own ~75 pounds of GrowStones and you're arguing with me using anecdotal statements. I know a guy who swears pigs can fly, that doesn't make it true or even a valid foundation for a contrary opinion. To be clear I am calling you out as being less than honest.    You claim to know a man, that says pigs fly, and you accuse me of being dishonest? Also, your own claim here is anecdotal as well. Without some kind of hard evidence presented, who's anecdotal evidence am i to believe? some random guy from the internet, or people i have met in real life, who i know were purchasing hydroponic supplies?   To some extent, but you're also demonstrating a lack of being informed. A solution with a high level of calcium carbonate, depending on temperature, has a resting pH above 7.2 but generally around 8.2.   We are not talking about a ""high level"" of calcium carbonate. Calcium carbonate is used as a PH buffer routinely.   Furthermore, pH above 7.0 ( neutral ) has a lot of consequences   We are all aware of this, as anyone having done even the most basic research into AP is. The question is if growstones are at fault in raising your PH, this is the area of contention.   Calcium carbonate IS NOT USED IN MAKING GLASS. Maybe you're mistaking calcium oxide CaO or Sodium carbonate Na2 CO3.    Calcium carbonate is certainly used in making glass, and any cursory search of the internet would have informed you of that. I quote corning's website:   Calcium carbonate, often called calcined limestone, is a stabilizer. Without a stabilizer, water and humidity attack and dissolve glass.   encyclopedia brittanica and mississippi lime have information on it's use.  I am sorry that you could not make this media work in your application. Having heard your experience, i am now even less likely to be purchasing this product. I had already purchased plenty of media before my local place started selling growstone, and i am glad i did. As i said before, i have not heard any specific complaints about them from those around me, but everyone seems to agree hydroton is superior.  In my experience, sometimes things work for some and not for others. Whenever i first started my experiments in AP, i had heard many stories about how using lava rock as a media was bad. Due to the high price of hydroton, i tried anyhow. I now use lavarock at about 8"", and hydroton on top, about 4"". It is working fantastically well, and really saved me a lot of money. This experience has taught me to take what i hear from the forums with a grain of salt.   also, lava rock is super cheap, i bought a literal 12ft trailer load for $200."
aquaponics,2w5srw,glennvtx,1 point,Sun Mar 1 18:52:43 2015 UTC,"Nice attitude. I have an opinion based on the use of growstone by people in my area. The ""local"" (40 miles away) hydroponics supplier began pushing growstones pretty hard almost 2 years ago, and many people i have met there have been using them successfully. They are much cheaper there than hydroton.   Going back to the start, my opinion was ""do not use growstones"" in context of aquaponics.   Hydro is practically cheating compared to AP, there are no restrictions on additives, the water is run to drain, and if the pH is out of whack, just flood it with PH Up or Down and life is good when it stabilizes.   You claim to know a man, that says pigs fly, and you accuse me of being dishonest?   Sarcasm, missed that train.   Without some kind of hard evidence presented     See the GrowStone MSDS and my math, worst case a 50 gallon/~190 liter GS bed will have 1.75KG of CaCO3.   Ask on /r/aquaponics what the community thinks would happens if you put even 250 mg of calcium carbonate into a 100 gallon system.  \2. I have personal experience, this is a graph of two systems with only one variable changed; the first with GS and then replaced with subpar LECA ( http://i.imgur.com/4ojNF7w.png ).  Not shown, the last half of August 2014 was spent washing the GS with a 10% solution of boric acid, flushed 2x, left in water for a day, flushed again, and then exposed to rain & sun for 4-5 days.  I took a sample of material & water, the pH was 6.8 which was a bit high for being exposed to rain but manageable.  Once installed, I immediately started noticing problems with pH locked to 8.2.  For the rest of september I threw increasing levels of stronger acid into the system; citric, acetic, phosphoric, and then HCL.  At the same time I was putting in almost daily doses of ammonium chloride in the hope that the two pronged attack would wipe out the last of the CaCO3 in tank, then I could flush everything, and put seashells and bicarbonate in small amounts to bring it back up to ~7.0.  Instead the ""pH buffer"" neutralized everything I threw at it.  Most of my API test kit readings are here - http://imgur.com/a/nmp2n/all  Unfortunately imgur removed the file names as titles so a hastily assembled index - http://i.imgur.com/1nq1k3t.png    API test procedure is as follows: draw 500ml into a clean pipette ( glass or single use plastic ), flush each vial twice, fill and follow API instructions.  Drain the vials, flush with neutral water, set to dry.  If readings are off or unexpected, I'll do tests 2-3x.    We are all aware of this, as anyone having done even the most basic research into AP is. The question is if growstones are at fault in raising your PH, this is the area of contention.   Using imperial, 1.75 KG is ~3.8 Lbs.   I buy my additives from Aquaponic source, specifically I bought http://www.theaquaponicstore.com/AquaUp-pH-Raising-Kit-5lb-p/awcas003.htm last year and its not even close to being half gone yet for multiple mini-systems and 24 SQFT of grow beds stocked with gold fish.  http://i.imgur.com/4ojNF7w.png - exact same equipment was used from the first half to last half, version 2.0 with LECA is now into its 3rd growing cycle ( cycle #1 was spinach, #2 mixed spinach/radish, #3 celery ).  Google ""Growstone hydroponics"" or ""growstone aquaponics"", beyond the company's sales pitch and merchants, the story repeatedly plays out like this - http://feelgoodaquaponics.blogspot.com/2012/10/troubleshooting-ph-blackwell-aquaponic.html  ( reading this one made me sad actually, especially reading between the lines ).   Calcium carbonate is certainly used in making glass, and any cursory search of the internet would have informed you of that.   I'll concede that I was wrong there.   We are not talking about a ""high level"" of calcium carbonate. Calcium carbonate is used as a PH buffer routinely.   Yes, a very high/exorbitant amount of CaCO3 is at the center of why GrowStones is a bad product.  pH is the measure of ionized hydrogen which is acidic, CaCO3 ( and various other carbonates/bicarbonates ) react to the hydronium and create compounds that will either outgas ( CO2 ) or been taken up by the plants or fish.  If there is too much CaCO3 in solution, pH will drift upwards towards the natural equilibrium of CaCO3 which is around 8.2 - 8.4 and stay there.   Minerals &   The gist of it is that I don't think anyone can make GS work with AP.  I have a hypothesis of what went wrong with my setup.  There was an AP owner in Florida who relayed an incident with a squirrel digging into a GS bed.  The top layer was leca, the rest GS.  After that incident, the pH was stuck above 8.0 and KH was +200ppm ( 200mg/l or 2 grams of carbonates in 10 liters of water ).  My hypothesis is that the Florida AP was flushed with the media already in place, with mine I flushed it outside in plastic barrels.  Prior to moving my material, the pH was 6.8.  Prior to the squirrel digging in the Florida AP, the pH was ""normal"" ( poster did not specify ).   Post squirrel/relocation, I suspect that CaCO3 trapped inside the growstones was exposed ( you can break a stone between finger and thumb with little effort, or just grind one down in the palm of your hand into ash.  Likely be a trivial exercise to test ( get pH neutral water, put GS in, flush with acid and fresh water till mostly neutral, crush the stones, measure pH/KH ) but one I can't do as I've buried my stuff under leca in the beds of the new system.  Summary on GrowStones, it's a bad product for AP and I think the manufacturer knows this:     The MSDS for GrowStone was missing for roughly 6 months and the new version now doesn't mention calcium carbonate. None of their proof/demonstration tests provide/show pH levels.   The one AP test they did used tilapia The oddness of stating CaCO3 is part of the manufacturing process and then saying they've specifically added a pH buffer.   More I think about that last one, short of some metals, I don't know of any acidic compound that could be used to buffer a system without releasing poisonous compounds alongside it.  If GrowStone has a natural high pH issue, why add a pH buffer?  Grand scheme of things, I am fairly bitter about GS.  I know I've gone above and beyond due diligence to ensure it wasn't operator error.  I used enough acid to possibly burn a hole through the floor plus I converted a couple months worth of ammonium chloride into nitrates without KH and pH even breaking a sweat."
aquaponics,2w5srw,zynix,1 point,Mon Mar 2 00:29:45 2015 UTC,"Well, you presented the data, i concede you are most likely correct. It seems they use the calcium carbonate not to stabilize (or widen) the temperature range that it can be worked, as in normal glass, but as their ""foaming agent"", This was the source of my confusion. The MSDS link is still missing from a few pages on their site, i suspect you are right in that they are doing ""damage control"".  I am sure our conversation here is going to be read by these people eventually, So i would say to them first, ""shame on you"" and also, find a different ""foaming agent"". Perhaps manganese dioxide would work, But that's not my area of expertise.  it's interesting the aquaculture test they mention only used it as a biofilter, perhaps a small biofilter on a very, very large system? This could be why some others seem to get along with this product, perhaps it is a small addition to a much larger overall system."

This could be why some others seem to get along with this product, perhaps it is a small addition to a much larger overall system.   I vaguely remember that one and being annoyed by it:  Fish tank is 1m3 which is 1.000 litre (really love metric sometimes ) or ~260 gallons of water.  Attached are two 190l/50 gallon drums, 1 is solids filtration and other is basically a pump ( possibly solids filter? ).  So ~100 gallons ( I own several 50 and 55 drums, reality is more like 90 gallons ).  Bbeing kind ( rounding up ), each test setup is 360 gallons to support 11 lbs of tilapia per setup.  Each test setup ( fish tank, 2 drums ) had 32 litres of filter media or 8 gallons ( bio beads, pellets, or GS ).  I've burned myself out doing the math/conversions in my head but I suspect that diluting 1 bag of GS across 360 gallons would completely negate any CaCO3 amounts.  For the 360 gallon systems, tilapia can sell for $1-3/lb in my region.  If you go back to their study, they're almost redlining on ammonia levels  ( mg/l is almost == to ppm, so their graphs show them reliably above 2-3ppm for all systems ) which doesn't leave room for increased stocking.  Also NH3 levels is kind of useless without pH.  Meanwhile these crazy idiots - http://journeytoforever.org/farm_library/Raisingcatfishinabarrel.pdf  -  ( is it stupid if it works? ) raised 40 catfish in a single 50 gallon drum for less than $100 and technically made a 50% profit.  Granted they did 30% water changes a day but the water went into garden, worm, and compost beds so not exactly a waste."

Once I have the golf fish balanced to to the first grow bed, I will add the second bed. Then more fish. From what I have read you want a 1:1 ratio of tank water to grow bed. The ten gallon grow bed only actually uses about 4 gallons of water because the hydroton takes up 60% of the space.

Cree CXA3070 is a good start.  check out this thread, from the people who have most to gain from efficient lights  I'm not aware of any good LED lights you can just buy for a good price. There are a few, but they are way overpriced. T8 fluorescent can be extremely cheap also, but they aren't as efficient as LED ( but they're not bad by any means!) and are limited in intensity/density. I doubt a hommade CFL setup is much better than this. Ideally you'd want a fixture with individual reflectors for each tube, but it's hard to beat the price of this thing. It can also be overdriven easily if you need more intensity and are willing to trade some efficiency."

aquaponics,2vscf1,neutral_cadence,1 point,Fri Feb 20 14:15:29 2015 UTC,"It's not just about lumens because technically a T8 averages 2800 lumens at 32 watts consumed power (87.5), the cree led light is 800 lumens at 9 watts (88.8) so you'll need MORE lights than a T8 but they run SO MUCH COOLER than a flouro you can pack them in a space much more densely and keep them closer to your plants without risking any kind of burning.   But it's not just about the lumens, it's also spectrum output and with the soft white leds putting out a good amount of both blue and red spectrum that plants can use for photosynthesis, it's cheap and effective. I've had VERY short internode growth with the LED's and a little reflector material (mylar) with great results. Everything loves the lights and they are a super quick setup, minimal technical skill is required (anyone can build these) and it's a whole lot better than nothing or wasting a bunch of money to 'dial-in' like so many other set ups.

aquaponics,2vqn7v,algoritm,5,Fri Feb 13 08:03:41 2015 UTC,"No, it won't flow up through the grow media. I needs to have some kind of gravel guard around it. Preferably a pvc pipe with small holes in it."
aquaponics,2vqn7v,kernowgringo,3,Fri Feb 13 08:31:52 2015 UTC,"Was thinking the same myself. I'm assuming this device would be housed inside another tube with holes in it which would allow the siphon to move similar to a standard bell siphon.   Also, happy cake day."
aquaponics,2vqn7v,Yipie,3,Fri Feb 13 08:31:32 2015 UTC,"Concept wise not too bad, but I see a couple of not small issues.   As others have commented the moving part on this is gonna be a killer. You're going to need a larger housing around this to prevent most of the debris. You have not only the chance that stuff get's caught underneath this (thereby raising the water level); but you also have the chance that smaller dirt or garbage will clog if not impede the up/down movement.    You can also kinda save this if you filter the fish waste before your grow bed (swirl or reverse flow), then less of a chance of issue, but roots from plants or debris from grow media can still affect this.   ""I"" really don't see this as ANY kind of killer to the Bell Siphon though, not only does it have a lack of moving parts, but to an extent due to the suction of the water, it's also self cleaning significantly extending it's mtbf. Both of the issues that can affect the above siphon, are at best a minor annoyance to the bell."
aquaponics,2vqn7v,Whittigo,2,Fri Feb 13 11:18:30 2015 UTC,"I would imagine the slightest spec of dirt or sand would stop this thing moving. As it's floating and the bed is filling with water we can see that there is no water dripping down into the box below, so we know it's a nice tight seal on the siphon, still loose enough for it to move though. So even some dust that inevitably comes off your grow media, whatever media you are using, would get stuck to the outside of that sliding tube and stop the motion.  Sure bell siphons aren't perfect, but once you dial them in you can pretty much set and forget them. I've got mine working in overgrown grow beds, with no solids filtration (I know, this will be fixed as soon as it's warm enough to work on it). And there are some I haven't touched in 8 months and are still draining fine repeatedly."

Algae is not harmful; it's actually beneficial to fish. It's just unsightly and it removes nitrates that you want for your plants. like /u/CTgreen said, if you don't let light into the tanks, then green algea is less able to grow. One other thing I noticed in your spreadsheet, however, is your pH is WAY too high. Your plants are going to hate that and wilt. Ideal pH for AP is ~just shy of 7. The nitrification process lowers the pH, but algal growth and fish waste will raise pH. It's a balance that sometimes needs some help by adding acidifying agents."

To help more with evaporation be sure the water level in your bed stays an inch or two below the surface of the media. Fish are pretty opportunistic with their food, have you tried increasing their feed rate or choosing a new feed? Be careful about adding more fish or feeding more. A slow approach is good, you just don't want to tip the system. Small systems are ultimately limited by their own design. Less water volume will lessen your system's ability to buffer changes in the water chemistry. That being said, the worms are a great means of breaking down excess solids, releasing minerals, and contributing to the overall health of the bed ecosystem (remember, you're really growing microbes)."

aquaponics,2vhit6,Spitinthacoola,5,Wed Feb 11 01:39:29 2015 UTC,"I recommend you have a look at the Timmons book. It explains nicely the whole concept of mass balances for recirculating aquaculture. The book also has a section about aquaponics where it revisits the mass balance approach in more simple terms.   Going straight to your question: how do you calculate flows?  The fist thing you have to understand is that the addition of feed in the system will drive changes in water quality. These changes in water quality have to be ""reverted"" somehow. We use different pieces of equipment to treat the water on each respective parameter we want to control. The main parameters we want to control are Oxygen, Carbon Dioxide, Total Suspended Solids and TAN. As design parameters, for every kilo of feed you deliver, you consume a kilo of oxygen, you produce 1.3 kilos of carbon dioxide, you produce 300 grams of solids and about 40 grams of TAN.   The simplest way of dealing with this would be to do a water exchange, which effectively will add oxygen and remove the rest. How much flow do do you need? The mass balance equation for flow is: Q= (consumption - generation) / (Cin - Cout) where:   Q: the flow needed. The flow your pump will push.   Consumption: in the case of oxygen, the amount of oxygen consumed by the fish and the bacteria in the system. In the case of TSS, TAN and CO2 the amount of these elements that you can actually REMOVE from the system with whatever device you are using.   Generation: in the case of oxygen, the amount of oxygen that you are realistically putting in the system. In the case of the others, the amount of TSS, TAN and CO2 that your fish and bacteria are producing.   Cin= the concentration of O2, CO2, TSS or TAN that will be going into your tanks, depending on the efficiency of the device you used to add O2 or remove CO2, TAN or TSS.  Cout= the maximum allowable concentration of each of the parameters: for tilapia, for example: 4mg/l of oxygen, around 40mg/l of CO2, 2 mg/l TAN and say, 25 mg/l TSS (tilapia dont care too much about TSS anyway).   As you can see, you can run this equation for each of the parameters and you will see you will get different flows for each of them. Basically you select the highest flow because it is your limiting one,and you will be overkill for the rest. That highest flow is your design flow.   Now, everying falls down to the maximum amount of feed you will put in your system. This is when production planning comes in: you have to be able to simulate a full production cycle in your system so as to find out in moment in time you will be delivering the highest amount of feed. Based on that peak feeding load, you run your equations.   In an aquaponic system, your plant component will have to be sized up to that feeding peak. And then your are safe.   In theory, tank volume and stocking densities are irrelevant because everything boils down to crapping the water and cleaning it back again as quickly as possible, regardless of whether your fish are crammed or not. System turnovers are just a function of a arbitrary tank volume and a CALCULATED flow.   In practice, stocking densities and tank sizes do matter because fish do not like being too crowded and because forcing too much water through a tank will end up generating too much water veocities which will exhaust your fish. Ideally, you want to determine your limiting flow first and then design the tanks based on that flow, instead of selecting a tank size first and trying to accomodate a turnover to it.   I hope this helps.   EDIT: many typos due to weird keyboard. I will fix that later."

Once Im finished working my way through and taking notes for RAS (Timmons + ebling ) I'll look for others. From my understanding the ""yellow book"" is as close to a bible as aquaponics has at the moment so I thought I'd digest it first.  Been reading a lot of fluid dynamics as well because calculating flow, the heads of various types (friction, velocity, total dynamic etc) is really interesting to me as is the mathematics behind efficiency of airlift pumps. Also because the timmons/ebling book is fairly light on details at certain points so supplemental reading is pretty necessary (ex. Fish population sampling)  My background is in biology/chemistry (specifically mycology) so all this physics is new to me but I'm really enjoying the ride so far."

Protip: search for the cornell aquaculture short course website, there you can download for free a lots of spreadsheets for mass balance and system design. Incredibly useful. Over the years I made my own spreadsheets, but these ones will easily get you started.   One thing the timmons book is lacking  in my opinion is tank design for other types of round tanks aside from the Cornell dual drain, it is also lacking on heating soultions and I can see that the latest edition was watered down on denitrification. Funnily I haven't checked the aquaponics section  yet.   To complement the gaps you need the Lekang book and dig through papers on denittification and nitrifying biofilters."

aquaponics,2vhit6,Aquaponics-Heretic,0,Thu Feb 12 06:09:20 2015 UTC,The fish tank should ideally be turned over twice an hour in a high stocking density increase that to 3 or 4 times depending on your system size.   Next you need to consider how high you are pumping water from your lowest point back to the top of your system this height also plays a large deciding factor.   Next is your horizontal length to consider how far is the farthest output from your pump?  Lastly are you doing any vertical system? These take higher GPH pumps than other systems because of the extra height the pump is required to lift. With those numbers you can decide what you need from there. I'm willing to bet some one else here has a formula to whip out but those are your main deciding factors.

A couple of observations:   1) Fish tank looks big in relation to thegrow beds. I guess you will be going with low densities  2) Maybe I am a bit too picky with tank hydrodynamics and my advice should my not be needed for a backyard setup, but the tank could perform better and make life a lot easier for you.   First, you dont have bottom drains, which means all the settable solids will remain on the bottom ok the tank, break down and affect water quality all over the system.   Second, your inlets point directly at the outlets, which mean all the cleaner water will rush to the exit without mixing with the rest of the tank. You will end up with a water quality gradient the fish will be fighting for.   There are two ways to tackle this:   First, heavy aeration in the tank. Easy and dirty. Will keep the water mixed and yor solids in suspension. You have to aerate a lot which increases your power consumption.   Second,upgrade your tank into a multivortex tank with dual drains using this example I just drew http://imgur.com/v1xu6jH  With this, you create to independent rotaing cells in the tank which will divert the solids from the bottom of the tank much quicker and gentler. Takes a bit more of work, but in the end is a cheaper, more elegant solution. There is literature out there on the subject, google for mixed flow raceways.   Nice build!"
aquaponics,2vbf5d,Pastelitomaracucho,1 point,Tue Feb 10 08:10:28 2015 UTC,"Thanks, I appreciate the advice and kind words. I will try to answer your questions, or explain a little better.  1) It is a bit large, and I do plan to keep the density down.  2) Thanks for the drawing, I like what you've done. I don't think my tank is as bad as you support though... I hope it isn't. My intake put the fresh water at the top of the tank, while I removing from about a foot and a half below the surface. I hope that helps the water mix better than what you're suggesting, but if not I'll add that to my lessons learned. I'll add it either way really, because either way your suggestion are better I believe.  I would draw you a picture to help illustrate what I'm talking about, but I don't quite have your skills in that department. lol Your fish are works of genius. :)  I don't think my intake cause enough movement in the water, and that's something I can correct immediately so I'll experiment with a few different options to see what works best.

FTR I am not saying he is doing a bad job at all, just that it doesnt show anything making it. Feynman found a good example, the theory was about all this stuff about mice learning to go through mazes. But one guy figured out that if you put sand on the floor, they would act differently.

I suppose some people might feel uneasy about it from an ethical perspective, but whatever. Many educators might have an ethical concern if they were aware that your employer sells marijuana growing seminars and will allow people from states where it remains illegal to take part in those seminars, but whatever. I just don't understand why you and your employer insist on pretending grants for plants isn't clearly meant to provide additional business revenue and marketing for the administrator of the org, which is Aquaponics Source. You have lots of links to products and expensive kits you can buy at Aquaponics Source right there on the site, but curiously there are no links to other suppliers. Surely if it was an independent organization you'd link to other suppliers and their products too, right?

We have an old media guard but it's tattered, we need to get a new one.   The water level is supposed to be below the gravel level, yes. The problem is that gravel got into the pipe where water is supposed to leave. It floods because water enters from the entry pipe faster than the water can leave the clogged drain. Now we need to figure out how to unclog it, and then prevent future clogs.   I'll consider media guard and sawing/replacing the standpipe, but unclogging the pipe is the big problem."

I am sure is a combination of everything.   Drain the system, install a service inlet which can be a threaded endcap or a tee with a standpipe that stand above the maximum water level in the system. From there you could insert a pressure hose and clean the pipes every now and then.   While you do those modifications, give the pipework a good clean."

aquaponics,2v96w0,Aquaponics-Heretic,0,Tue Feb 10 02:40:17 2015 UTC,Be careful when using hydroxides they can burn you way easier than other options like carbonates that will benefit your microbes much better not to mention if you accidentally overshoot a hydroxide you just killed everything if you over shoot a carbonate your change wont be as fast and give you more time to do something about your screw up. Both are reasons to use carbonates over hydroxides. The other issue is many shipping companies will not handle hydroxides due to there caustic nature where as carbonates are perfectly safe to ship on a plane. Remember alkalinity is very important in aquaponic systems as well. A dKH below a 2 cuts your bacteria replication rate in half. In an aquaponic system this is critical to not only your nitrification but all your other mineral availability. This is one of the single most over looked aspects of aquaponics because many aquaponic enthusiasts came from a hydroponic backgrounds instead of a biology background.
aquaponics,2v96w0,PotentPonics,3,Mon Feb 9 17:51:09 2015 UTC,"Addition of hydroxides addresses the question of ""alkalinity"" directly...

You may choose to use fish to start the cycle, or do a fishless cycle.  You can always jump start the cycle with some used filter media from another pond or fish tank, It already contains a colony of the the beneficial bacteria you want. That can speed the process up by a few weeks."

aquaponics,2v08tc,MilkCurds,3,Fri Feb 6 18:46:57 2015 UTC,"Traditional filters in aquariums or ponds have a physical form of filtering solids out of the water. This could be something like filter floss (http://www.shop.mediabaskets.com/images/IMG_7691.jpg).  You would be right in assuming rocks from a local pond/stream contain these bacteria but it isn't the safest option. Those rocks may also have harmful bacteria to your fish/you as well. Aquariums and man-made ponds are more of a controlled environment in regards to what bacteria you are getting.  You can buy a bottle of bacteria for cheap or you can purchase a small fraction of your planned number of fish to help add low levels of ammonia to the system and work your way up.  Good luck, this process can take many weeks before ammonia and nitrite levels stay at safe levels for your fish. Be patient for the fish that have to swim in it 24/7."

Plenty of people do that though for aquariums. the Walstad method is something that has recently peaked my interest as well.  I'd say the safest way to start the bacteria would be to find a local fish store and ask for a scoop of gravel from their tanks, or an filter pad. I'm convinced that those bottles all go anoxic after a short period on the shelves and are utterly useless afterwards."

aquaponics,2v08tc,PotentPonics,1 point,Fri Feb 6 21:29:09 2015 UTC,"Nitrogen cycle:       The nitrogen cycle is the process by which nitrogen is converted between its various chemical forms. This transformation can be carried out through both biological and physical processes. Important processes in the nitrogen cycle include fixation, ammonification, nitrification, and denitrification. The majority of Earth's atmosphere (78%) is nitrogen,  making it the largest pool of nitrogen. However, atmospheric nitrogen has limited availability for biological use, leading to a scarcity of usable nitrogen in many types of ecosystems. The nitrogen cycle is of particular interest to ecologists because nitrogen availability can affect the rate of key ecosystem processes, including primary production and decomposition. Human activities such as fossil fuel combustion, use of artificial nitrogen fertilizers, and release of nitrogen in wastewater have dramatically altered the global nitrogen cycle.

The blue boxes represent stores of nitrogen, the green writing is for processes that occur to move the nitrogen from one place to another and the red writing are all the bacteria involved.

aquaponics,2uwlb8,columnmn,2,Fri Feb 6 02:04:37 2015 UTC,The plants que in on the vibration. If you do this every day you can increase the over all flower count. The plant becomes happy because it thinks there are lots of pollinators around and will successfully seed so it throws out more flowers since the last set went so well. It really does help with most vineing crops and others.

Note that i don't have any real experience with growing plants or fish.  quick description of the system: -40 gal tank on the bottom with ~40 small tilapia -using an ebb/flow with two different pumps (one for each container) .  They are staggered so that i don't drain the fish tank too much. -the blue containers are filled with a couple of inches of the clay pellets to kind of act as a bio-filter. -i also have a standard aquarium bio-filter, fish light, air stone, water heater for the fish.  I expect that I'll have to modify the system soon to give the fish more room and to give more distance between the plant containers and the lights for them to grow more.  I'll probably figure out how to add a bell siphon and a sump tank too while I'm at it.    My only real issue so far is that my tomato plants are flowering, but none of the flowers seem to have pollinated yet.

You can successfully cycle your system with 2 ppm of ammonia...  The point being made is that concentrations above 4 ppm.... actually inhibit the bacterial processes... particularly inhibiting the nitrite to nitrate conversion  And many ""fishless cycling"" advocates suggest levels of 4 - 8 ppm... inevitable leading to nitrite levels of 5 ppm+.. which linger for weeks .... ;)  Myself..

It is quite possible that you have a more experience and a deeper understanding in respect to cycling than I do, and I am always open to learning from others but you come off as awfully smug, man."

I agree that cycling with fish certainly requires a much greater degree of diligence.. and to some extent a degree of understanding of the process...  But that's partly the point.. as it encourages the ""newbie"" to be patient.. and to test and chart the results.... and develop an understanding of what's occurring in the system...  Fishless cycling is a bit like throwing a kid in a car with an automatic gear box.... they learn where the accelerator and brake are.. and roughly where to point the car... but they have no awareness of what's going on around them... and how to ""look forward"".. and think ahead..:D"

aquaponics,2usd9p,skuba,1 point,Wed Feb 4 21:39:24 2015 UTC,Id like to see an update video but I couldn't find one.  I'd be worried about root rot but if it works this is a pretty neat (and cost effective) desktop herb garden for the kitchen!  It would also be a good conversation piece when guests come over.
aquaponics,2usd9p,Optimoprimo,2,Wed Feb 4 22:18:14 2015 UTC,"he did eventually post updates that i watched, a 4 day, 12 days, 4 weeks, and 10 weeks. seems like they all did rather well."
aquaponics,2usd9p,harley-rose,1 point,Thu Feb 5 03:55:22 2015 UTC,Basically a raft system. I have something similar on my desk. He is fooling himself if he thinks all the goldfish waste is going to be taken care of by bacteria. This system will definitely need routine gravel siphoning. I use a tiny air driven filter and it works great. Also that many goldfish are going to overwhelm the system with ammonia. That looks like a 2.5 or a 5 gallon tank. I wouldn't even put one goldfish in that. Guppies or small ornamentals only.
aquaponics,2usd9p,Optimoprimo,2,Wed Feb 4 23:15:34 2015 UTC,It says 14 gallons in the descriptions.

There are larger versions of it that are much more powerful, but I find this one to be sufficient for a 5 gallon, plus it provides the best DO even against the larger versions. The pre-packaged filters you can buy for it have activated carbon, so they aren't great for growing things. I just made a simple plastic frame with a mesh that fits inside instead."
aquaponics,2usd9p,TheWhyteMaN,1 point,Thu Feb 5 18:49:20 2015 UTC,"oh thank you! i've seen so many different pumps and filters and siphons and tubing that it was starting to get a little daunting to figure out where to start. though i did find an ideal set up for me to learn, but all the other details started piling on."

Just play around with what you think you'd like, don't be afraid to fail, and learn as you go. The small toy systems can be difficult because you don't have a nice big buffer from chemistry changes. You'd be best to keep it as simple as possible on yourself first, get that to work. Once that is moving, you can decide to make adjustments or additions. Or hell, even revamp the whole thing once you get the money and the understanding to do it."
aquaponics,2usd9p,Optimoprimo,1 point,Thu Feb 5 19:17:55 2015 UTC,that was the most perfect thing to hear right now. i am prone to anxiety. like---bad. really bad. but when i have things to focus on such as these sort of projects i feel some calm. and i have been wanting an excuse to work with water for a long time. and then i found this. and i dove into the research.   i did overwhelm myself but i am just so excited about the project now. and i know that the learning process and focus will be great for me. i just catastrophized too much in the beginning of the research process.  thanks so much for your encouragement.

aquaponics,2ur5nq,thatbookishgirl,9,Wed Feb 4 14:00:58 2015 UTC,"I've had one for about six months.  It's a good place to start, especially as you read and learn about aquaponics and plan a larger system.  That said, it's basically an aquarium that demonstrates you can use wheat grass instead of a fish filter.  It won't teach you the finer points of system design, or really even water management.  I haven't been able to grow anything other than wheat grass with any success.  It will, however, give you some insight into general concepts like growing media, what it takes to change plants/plantings, how location of a system will impact its performance, etc.  It is expensive, but it looks good and is well built.  As others have said, you can probably build something yourself for cheaper, BUT, I doubt it would look as good sitting on a counter or out on display.  Additionally, I ran into paralysis by analysis when looking into my first system (well, if I'm going to build an aquafarm analog, why not just go a little bigger... or bigger still).  That said, you will have to buy some additional stuff to put in there (a heater is a must, and frankly you need some decorations), and the initial costs do add up.  TL;DR:  It's a good mascot for aquaponics, but not really practical in terms of production."
aquaponics,2ur5nq,Astrocragg,5,Wed Feb 4 15:00:17 2015 UTC,"I agree with everything above, except the heater.  I don’t use a heater in mine, and it’s done fine to grow wheatgrass.  I’ve had very little success growing anything else.  I got a basil plant to grow a few leaves, but that’s about it.  But, I don’t have any sunny windows where my aquafarm could sit, so I tried using a small daylight spectrum lamp to grow the basil.  Like I said, I got a few basil leaves, but nothing very good.  I think my system is mostly limited by the lack of sunlight.  I actually did a couple reviews of the aquafarm Part 1 (old design), Part 2 (new design) a while back."
aquaponics,2ur5nq,dirkwork,1 point,Wed Feb 4 20:36:37 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I guess if your ambient temp is pretty constant, a heater isn't necessary.  I threw one in just to make sure."
aquaponics,2ur5nq,Astrocragg,5,Wed Feb 4 20:39:35 2015 UTC,"I have one, it works okay at best. I never could get very hardy herbs to grow BUT it grows grasses great. We put dog grass for our pets in it and it gross very nice, when manicured it actually is really cool looking."

aquaponics,2ur5nq,fazuku,4,Wed Feb 4 18:39:32 2015 UTC,"I own it.  A few things I've noticed: The wheat grass grows and dies quickly, I would suggest something else, maybe cat grass?, all the basil seeds sprouted and then died, not sure why, I'm going to try a few starter plants in spring when they are available in my area.    I used some plastic over the pots to germinate the seeds and misted them every day, this worked well.  I put guppies in as they are cheap and look nice.    Overall a nice edition to my kitchen counter, I dont expect to get any herbs from it, but its a nice talking point to explain aquaponics to friends and family."
aquaponics,2ur5nq,fazuku,3,Wed Feb 4 22:10:40 2015 UTC,perfect information. i decided to build one myself after hearing all this feedback and doing further research.

I don't know if the packets of water treatment it comes with did it or not, but once we ran out of it, the last fish did fine. He's been alive for 4 months or so.  Our first attempt at planting stuff (once a fish lasted more than a night) was the basil and wheat grass that it comes with. The wheat grass grew fast and tall and green. The basil grew very slow and turned yellow and we never got to use it. Everything we planted after that hasn't worked at all. It's probably our lack of experience, but I was hoping it would be little maintenance and easy learning for beginners. Even with a grow light on it all day, nothing grows"
aquaponics,2ur5nq,MilkCurds,1 point,Wed Feb 4 21:09:25 2015 UTC,"Hrm, this sounds like you didn't allow the tank to equalize. Its really important that before you put fish in a tank that you run it for a month so all the chemicals leech out and the PH equalizes. Do the instructions say the tank is ready for fish out of the box? If so, thats totally not how you build a sustainable aquarium."
aquaponics,2ur5nq,Krystal907,1 point,Thu Feb 5 02:23:18 2015 UTC,"I did the instructions exactly, until 2 fish died.

aquaponics,2ur5nq,Krystal907,4,Wed Feb 4 14:44:49 2015 UTC,do you have any sites that give good aquaponics DIY? i would have to start small given my apartment living but I want to start learning and that would need to be on a small scale. then i would move up to larger set ups.
aquaponics,2ur5nq,ranoutofbacon,1 point,Wed Feb 4 18:38:54 2015 UTC,http://www.backyardaquaponics.com/single-barrel-aquaponic-system/  My first system was the one on the bottom (right side of photo). It worked fairly well but the temperatures outside fluctuated too much for my feeder fish and I believe they got a bacteria infection.  If I were to retry a small system like that I would probably go with the one on the left side of the same picture (T-shaped) because it provides a higher growbed to fishtank ratio; resulting in better filtration for your water. If you shop around you can probably get all the materials needed for ~$100 (excluding lights if you are growing indoors).
aquaponics,2ur5nq,wwiijunkieschu,7,Fri Feb 6 18:23:10 2015 UTC,I would discourage it because there is no fish you could humanely keep in there. Those things are only big enough to house a colony of shrimp which wouldn't produce enough waste.

Its the best way to grow larger plants, trees, cannabis, and many others. Sure its not best for quick turn leafy greens but that doesn't mean it doesn't have enormous application to commercial aquaponics. Especially in regards to cannabis production."
aquaponics,2usyeu,Aquaponics-Heretic,3,Thu Feb 5 23:40:13 2015 UTC,"Media beds.. with their associated unknown, unmonitorable and uncontrollable biological processes... have NO part in commercial aquaponics...  They were abandoned years ago as both bio-logical and mechanical filtration... and as a grow media.... in both aquaculture and hydroponics respectively...  The suggestion that media beds have any significant advantage in a commercial operation... is, and has always, been based more on backyard belief and circular promotion... than on any demonstrable science... or even any data collection from those employing them...  In the opinion of many... the ""flawed media"" concept of current ""commercial"" aquaponics is not only a retro-grade step... but is actually hindering the advancment of the ""industry"""
aquaponics,2usyeu,PotentPonics,-2,Tue Feb 10 03:06:10 2015 UTC,"First of all the study they cite about media beds harboring bacteria they not only introduced pathogens to the water they injected the fish with them. Then they continued to introduce more bacteria to the water then tested the fish for pathogens. This is FAR from an accurate representation of how it would work in a real setting. Theres a much better written response coming to the nonsense that was the recommendations. Media beds are the best way to raise high yield crops. Not even remotely close. Its why its how the cannabis industry grows in Aquaponics now. Just FYI there are more than one commercial aquaponic cannabis operation in existence now so saying it has no commercial application could not be father from the truth. Did you read the studies that were used to reference the attack on media beds? Its ridiculous and not founded on science.   Media beds were abandon because people didn't have the concept of dual root zoneing yet. I will 100% agree for leafy greens quick turn herbs and other fast growing plants raft based systems are teh way to go. For bread and butter keep the lights on at a commercial AP farm most farms use rafts as there main production method. But most AP farms are not trying to survive on fruiting crops or cannabis both of which are increasingly becoming more and more common. The problem with rafts is this does not allow for high enough micros, phosphate, or potassium for high yield fruiting plants. Fruit trees as well will not grow in a raft system. Some species will but most will not tolerate being wet all the time. Trees are a great example of a plant that required a media bed as does any fruiting plant really to get maximum potential from the plant. Will I get some tomatoes SURE but I can take that same tomatoes put it in a dual root zone pot and get 30 - 40% more tomatoes from it why would I not do that? Media beds provide the BEST growing method for FRUITING plants. Media beds and dual root zoning both provide MUCH better methods of mineralization that are just as safe as raft beds.   The problem with raft beds is its a dead end. There is no way to increase minerlization in a raft bed with out changing the chemistry so much that it will effect your fish. In a media bed you have some solids present to the roots or in a dual root zone a soil layer that can be amended to your choosing to solve this issue. Rafts are awesome for low nutrient plants but not ones with high nutrient requirements."

aquaponics,2usyeu,PotentPonics,0,Tue Feb 10 03:50:34 2015 UTC,Again I'm not arguing that for your main production rafts are a great option and probably the best way to keep the lights on. But you need to diversify beyond just leafy greens to fruiting plants if you want to have a happy healthy CSA or farm share or any other kind of regular food shop people want more than just whats easy to grow. Also would love to know why wicking beds weren't brought up in the recommendations. They too are an amazing way to get high yields of non leafy green crops from an aquaponic system. I know more than one commercial AP grow that grows there tuber crops that way.
aquaponics,2usyeu,Aquaponics-Heretic,2,Tue Feb 10 04:10:26 2015 UTC,"Wicking beds, or dual zone pot container growing methods.. can both be set alongside of media beds for the purpose of discussion... and concerns.. perhaps more so...  See later post... ;)"

aquaponics,2usyeu,PotentPonics,-1,Tue Feb 10 06:50:53 2015 UTC,I have lab results that show on average a 30%+- increase in tomatoes yields in a duel root zone. I have even more data on cannabis bud weight production in raft vs media bed vs dual root zone stacks and stacks of data on cannabis its what I'v been working on for the last 2 years lol. There is a company a few years ago tho tried to grow cannabis before it was legal in the states and they tried and failed horribly with rafts. We have not had that problem using our methods. Aquaponics is becoming increasingly popular in the cannabis industry as well.   Depends on what your growing here in the US we have options you Australians do not. Aside from that its hard to survive on just leafy greens you need to have other things for customers even if they are less profitable. Alternatively you can also farm things like tropical fish or inverts which can fetch very high prices and is how I fund my person greenhouse. Its a way alot of people could make more money from a commercial operation. I know its done quite a bit in florida and the south.

Can YOU point to any published scientific papers.. that either refute these studies... or uphold your SUPPOSITION that media beds are commercially advantageous??

In terms of the studies... and there are others.... there are concerns that need to be borne in mind... regardless of the methodologies employed...  How much they pertain to aquaponics generally.. or can be extrapolated to a media bed context...  Is a question I'll address in another post reply in one of your other posts...  In part.. I'll actually be agreeing with you.... :D

According to Laval University in Canada, not only could used water from fish farming stimulate tomato growth, but it could also protect them against certain pathogenic fungi.   So if anything AP is a safer way to grow according to this study.   On thing I thought of tho is maybe we are agreeing but not realizing it? We agree I think that commercial AP should have a prefilter for media beds or rafts. I agree on that in a commercial setting your waste it just to high to rely on media beds for filtration but to say that they are more dangerous than a raft system is not correct."

aquaponics,2usyeu,PotentPonics,0,Tue Feb 10 06:55:31 2015 UTC,For one the cannabis industry is strictly regulated and its up to the companies who operate to disclose such things. As far as any one else opening up there books why on earth would any company open there books to the public? Just because they do not open there books to the public doesn't mean they don't do well. No industry would do that I know you and others keep asking for books have you shared yours at the company you work at there in Australia? If I recall correctly it is indeed an aquaponics company no?

I'd suggest that that's not indicative of any ""mainstream"" commercial aquaponics farmers... or indeed indictative of the US ""industry""... let alone world wide...

The chemical equation that drives the relationship between ammonia and ammonium is:  NH3 + H2O ↔ NH4+ + OH-  When the pH is low, the reaction is driven to the right, and when the pH is high, the reaction is driven to the left. In general, at a temperature of around room temperature, at a pH less than 6.0, the proportion of ammonium-N plus ammonia-N as NH3 is very-very low and as NH4+ is very-very high. At a pH around 8.0,  the proportion as NH3 is 10 percent or less, and at a pH slightly above 9.0, the proportion is about 50 percent. The activity of aqueous ammonia also is much lower at low temperatures and higher at warm temperatures. This means that at low temperatures and low pH the activity as NH3 is even lower, and as NH4+ is even higher. Therefore, sensitive aquatic organisms can tolerate a higher total “ammonium-N plus ammonia-N” at low temperatures than at high temperatures due to much less aqueous NH3 being present in the water.   This give rise to the ""total ammonia vs pH vs temperature"" chart such as shown... http://www.ecofilms.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Total-Ammonia-Nitrogen-Table-Small.jpg"

Structural screws have a decent shear strength but those are more specialized and uncommon.  In general, wood screws actually have a significantly lower shear strength than your average nail. That's one of the main advantages of nails over screws and why they are required in most building codes to be used in framing.

If you have a whisper filter or something like that it doesn't work. You'd really be better off just making a raft that floats at the top and allows the roots to grow in. It's less showy I know, but it makes the most sense for such little water. Also goldfish probably aren't the best for a smaller tank either. They create too much waste. Stick to ornamentals like guppies, platys, etc."

I see what you're describing and feel free to give it a shot.. but you're going to have difficulty raising the whisper filter to the degree you'd want. At a certain level out of the water the thing just stops working. You may be able to get a tiny nutrient film system out of it but it wouldn't be very long. Also you're going to have problems keeping your water chemistry stable. A single plant or fish added or removed may throw off the balance and cause alkalinity or nitrite spikes. Just things to look out for. Yes also the best plan when starting a new system is to get the fish settled and happy and then add the plants."

aquaponics,2u4ncw,DeviousNes,6,Thu Jan 29 22:05:43 2015 UTC,"with those stones you've probably got quite the calcium carbonate buffer going.  That means until all of the basic carbonate is almost entirely gone, it will keep buffering so that the water stays at least ~8ish ph.  To stand any change of getting ph down to a reasonable 6.8-7 you'll need inert media"
aquaponics,2u4ncw,tewls,3,Fri Jan 30 03:58:42 2015 UTC,"Simply this.   You have to take out any source alkalinity.   Provided that you can suply enough oxygen, increasing feeding load will increase nitrification and and thus alkalinity destruction. If your plants cannot cope nitrification, installing a biofilter or increasing the plant component will help."
aquaponics,2u4ncw,Pastelitomaracucho,1 point,Fri Jan 30 14:15:15 2015 UTC,"A little bit seems to go a very long way, but peat moss is a fairly powerful acidifying agent that won't kill your fish immediately.  I've been experimenting with it to try and wash some expanded glass aggregate.    Mostly what I've read suggests to presoak a portion of peat moss for a day or two to get most of the yellowish tinge out of it but even then it will discolor the water slightly and give it a yellow hue.  As for amount to water ratio, I don't know yet."
aquaponics,2u4ncw,zynix,1 point,Fri Jan 30 20:07:48 2015 UTC,How are you containing your peat moss by the way? I've tried it as well and it made a huge mess.
aquaponics,2u4ncw,Optimoprimo,1 point,Fri Jan 30 20:26:23 2015 UTC,"I just wrapped a golf ball sized amount in cheesecloth and set it under the feed line for my bed, let it cycle 1-2 times and then set it aside in a glass jar ( peat moss cannot be allowed to completely dry out or it will stay dry ).  A small bit goes a long way.  I have seen people put it into canister filters but I don't have enough confidence to use the right amount of peat moss to neutralize X amount of carbonates."
aquaponics,2u4ncw,zynix,0,Fri Jan 30 20:56:11 2015 UTC,"First of all hands down to you for craftsmanship that looks like professional carpenter work.      Do you have any numbers like current PH, previous PH ? phosphorus lvls, iron, nitrite and nitrate. If you can give me those numbers I can tell you exactly what is wrong and how to combat high PH.         Bacteria loves high PH so there's a chance Amonia is being converted to amonium and is not being converted further considering you'd need lower than 8.0 PH for the bacteria to use water as a decent catalyst. Also I see a comment mentioning the rocks, these look like your typical phosphate rocks. Although they do contain a small amount of calcium you'd need a PH lower than 5.5 to start eroding away the calcium into the pond. So unless your soil is pure acid I highly doubt this being the issue.          Now you did mention your plants are dying and the reason I ask you for numbers is because of 1 thing: Iron. Iron as you may know is incredibly important in plant growth to keep cell structure intact and to provide catalysts for the plant's growth. That said iron is not soluble at high PH.            You also mentioned that rain water gets into your pond: This is great ! Rain water is slightly acidic due to sulfur and sulfur is actually a really cool micro-nutrient to have for plant growth as it promotes strength in roots and cell walls. So from here if you can get any numbers I'd recommend quantifying the chemicals in your aquaponics system. If you cannot I really recommend finding out a least PH. Once you have PH if it is over 9.0 than the problem is bacteria not converting ammonia correctly. In order to drop PH you'll need to do 1 of 3 things:        *Use lemon juice every day until ph drops to 6 *Use vinegar (not recommended because of fish) in very small doses throughout the week until ph drops to 6 *Use an acidic formula from a hydroponic store (recommended)  EDIT: I used PH down a simple formula, about a tablespoon everyday until I saw PH drop. and when it drops it drops really fast mine went from around 8 to 6 within a few days. I didn't see any changes in PH for days at first so don't get discouraged its killing the bacteria slowly)"

aquaponics,2u4cl1,nillotampoco,3,Fri Jan 30 04:55:30 2015 UTC,While bacteria can occur naturaly it can take a really long time and most people would rather not wait that long. The more creatures you have in your food web the better. Just thought it was a cool video showing alot of the critters in an aquaponic system. I don't recall ever seeing any microscope video from an aquaponic system before.
aquaponics,2u4cl1,nillotampoco,1 point,Fri Jan 30 16:27:28 2015 UTC,"Yep it's just that you're also selling a sponge without also being convincing about why these tiny shrimp, daphnia, and planarians are necessary.  I'll just have to be doubtful, when any 100% free pond scum would perform the same."
aquaponics,2u3ys1,highflyer83,3,Thu Jan 29 19:03:24 2015 UTC,"It would be best to plan for them to grow.  One of my microsystems wiped out all of the fish as they grew, overwhelming the biosystem and plants capability to absorb nitrates.  Now I usually understock and seed in waves until I start seeing nitrate deficiencies and then harvest what I can or cull new seedlings ( slowly ).  Just googled for plant nutrient deficiencies and this style of guide is my preferred ( http://aquathusiast.com/nutrientdeficiency/ ) as its easy to quickly identify the different possible issues.  And to repeat, with AP its best to go slowly with adjustments."
aquaponics,2u3ys1,zynix,2,Thu Jan 29 19:48:48 2015 UTC,"So, the most important thing you have you find out is your maximum feeding load. A system's carrying capacity can be ultimately definided by the maximum amount  of feed it can sustain, and that is where you have to aim.  Why is feed load so important? Because it is the addition of feed what drives the changes in water quality. These are changes your plants and your system must work out against to restore them to acceptable levels. If you more feed than what the system can cope with, it crashes.   Assuming 50 gram a day is your maximum load, it is easy to understand that no matter how much fish you have, 50 gram is the limit. In theory, you could have one fat, 5 kilo fish being fed at 1% body weight a day (50 grams) or 25 fish being fed 2 grams each. In the end it doesn't matter.   Lets say your fingerlings are two gram each. And you buy 5 kilos of them. You feed them at a rate of about 15% their bodymass. That equals 0.75 kilos or 750 grams of feed. That is 15 times your maximum load.   Let's work it the other way around. You want to harvest your fish at .5 kilo. The feeding rate on a fish that big is 1.5% bodyweight. 1.5% of 500 grams is 7.5 grams.  How many fish of 500 grams, being fed this amount do you need to reach your maximum load? 6.6 (rounded up): 7. If you were to start an full batch of fish from fingerling to harvest size, 7 fish is the max.   Obviously this feeding load can be planned so you distribute it among fish of different sizes so you don't have to harvest everything in one go.   I hope its clear. Good luck"

I did a VERY light sprinkling of Cinnamon over the top layer of my hydroton (now that I know what it is called)  sooo it wasn't enough to penetrate past the top 2"" of media.   My water might not have been affected.  it MAY however be affected next time we get some rain since my System is outdoors in a section of my Patio that is uncovered.    The fish are eating fine, swimming around fine.  They are just little guys, maybe 3-4"" long.

For me its been an ongoing saga of trying to get some catfish which is approaching Monty Python levels; first batch died on my porch when I tripped, second batch died when the power failed and I had everything plugged into the surge protector side of the UPS, third batch died from cold shock when the heater failed.   On the plus side, last time I went to my local hatchery the owner just started laughing when I showed up.  On topic, if you have a wet filter for a shop vac, you can try vacuuming up parts of the dry layer, rinse that with some hydrogen peroxide ( it kills everything ), soak it in water for a day or so and voila your LECA ( light expanded clay aggregate ) is almost good as new.

No idea how these little black ants got in my patio, never had an ant problem since I moved in here a little over 5 years ago.  Just one day a few months ago I saw one of two black ants walking around the top of my system, didn't think much of it, until just yesterday...     I have not noticed anything affected in my System.. but when I bend down to look into my fish holding tank my hair touches the top table and  sometimes ants are crawling on that, I did not want to get up with a bunch of ants in my hair/head.  My System is right outside my patio.    Last year was the first year in over 4 years that I was successfully able to grow veggies in my patio.   Since the System is lifted higher on a table, just high enough to peep over my patio wall, the plants now receive more direct sunlight than they would have if planted in the ground.  I'll try and post pics as soon as I have things settled back there.   Didn't see as many ants today but still weary."

aquaponics,2u05tf,LosWasabi,3,Thu Jan 29 08:13:25 2015 UTC,"You have hydroton for media. If you haven't cleaned your grow bed in a while, they could conceivably be nesting in the root balls and detritus of your plants. You need to clean out your grow beds once and a while to prevent this buildup. As far as preventing ants; if they can't climb up to your grow bed, they can't nest in it right? At the base of your system, put deterrents to keep them from climbing up. The best one is a continuous line of dawn dish soap. They won't cross it and it is safe from a water contamination perspective. Other good deterrents are citrus peels, coffee grounds and peppermint oil. The cinnamon in your water should be fine, don't add anything else. Just calm the hell down, your system will live. If you can find the nest, you can pour these things right into it and they will clear out. But really a grow bed should not be a nice place for ants if you practice regular maintenance. I'd bet more than anything you just need to clean house a bit."
aquaponics,2u05tf,glennvtx,1 point,Thu Jan 29 03:38:11 2015 UTC,"thank you.  I gotta post pics of my System.  See I live in a Condo with my rear patio facing EAST so I get VERY limited sunlight (between 4-6 decent hrs) and in the winter (now) it's gotten worse since now the days are shorter as well, sooo growth has been slowed down drastically,  I have a few bell peppers that put out microscopic peppers.. ok maybe not microscopic, but they are tiny, about 3 inches long and 1-2.5"" in diameter.   I have an Aloe Vera in there (for shits and giggles)  some basil (whatever survived) and the tomato plants that are pretty much not very productive, mostly my fault since they do flower but by the time I see the flowers they are past the point of polination -__-  I have to hand polinate the plants here bc there aren't very many bees.   Sooo since the hours were soo short I stopped visiting my growbed as much, I have an auto feeder for the fish, go check it on occasion, top the water off etc.  But you are right, I need to do more regular maintenance."
aquaponics,2u05tf,griffiths79,0,Thu Jan 29 20:06:44 2015 UTC,"Please do post pics! Why not get a nice grow light to hang over everything? You can use the sunlight as support, but this way you can also get some good yield year round. In my opinion, you also don't want crops to just live in there forever. They should be removed after a time or at least trimmed back because the roots will continue to grow ridiculously expansive and can eventually clog things. Tomatoes will especially do this. Do you filter your solids before the water enters the bed?"
aquaponics,2u05tf,zynix,2,Thu Jan 29 21:30:01 2015 UTC,"I had ants set up in my beds before.  The top couple of inches where it didn't get flooded.  I extended the stand pipe until it flooded the entire bed (water running over the sides) out came the ants with their larvae. Drained it & flooded it like this a few times seem to drive them out.  I always use diatomaceous earth around the beds & around the base of the growbeds, & on the plants & tops of the beds which help alot. Good luck!"
aquaponics,2tzs1a,AnAsian,1 point,Wed Jan 28 19:19:29 2015 UTC,There are a lot of 55 gal fish tank with one grow bed builds out there.  If you wanted to do it more as a demonstration piece that would be a way to go.  I think for you its going to come down to space.  If you can get some room in the greenhouse check out some IBC tote builds but obviously that isn't feasible in a small space.  The larger volume of water will stabilize things and make for a much better system and using natural light will drastically cut costs as you dont need to buy a lighting system (which is what most of the cost of a build comes from). Good luck! I think its a great project.  I did something similar with a hydroponics drip system last year for school.

aquaponics,2tzs1a,skuba,1 point,Thu Jan 29 00:15:07 2015 UTC,There are so many cool things in aquaponics.  It's really a matter of how far you want to push it.  Id be sure to add red wiggles (worms) to your grow bed to help keep the system clean.  In addition think about adding a swirl filter to remove solids.  In that swirl filter you can even add these tiny shrimp that I can't remember the name of right now or prawns which will eat the detritus. Those shrimp can be used as fish feed or food for you.  Also look into growing duck weed in your system to close another loop on terms of feeding the fish.  I'd say to look at it that way in the planning stages.  What loops can I close?

One is long term nutrient availability of micros which is ALOT more important for trees and the other is that most trees can't stand being in a normal flood and drain they must be on there own timer that gives them alot longer to dry out than a normal AP flood and drain. We have ours setup in 55 gallon drums setup in a dual root zone and an every other day timer. The other big issue you have is most trees are cued in for a temperature change not a photo period change to start flowering so we have ours on pallets with wheels so we can disconnect the pluming and wheel them out of the greenhouse to cool down in the spring and get them to flower. We do the same in the fall and get a winter fruiting as well :)

aquaponics,2ty5dm,chrisfender0,-5,Wed Jan 28 17:06:19 2015 UTC,"AQUAPONICS OVERVIEW Aquaponics isn’t rocket science however there are some hard fast rules that must be followed.  Let’s start with an explanation of what Aquaponics is and how it works with an AQUAPONICS OVERVIEW. Hydroponics is the art of growing plants in a solution of nutrient rich water without soil. The solution is created by adding the nutrients to the water which is fed directly to the plant’s roots. In some hydroponic systems the roots are suspended without any growing medium with the water sprayed on them in a time interval manner and in others they are in a growing medium which keeps them moist, aerated and helps to support the plant. A well balanced hydroponics system provides the plants with the proper water, nutrient ratios and optimum conditions for expedited growth. In aquaculture, the fish are the delivering vehicle for nutrient rich water as a result of the fish digesting their food and excreting waste. In aquaculture systems, the waste water has to be filtered and/or disposed of in some manner to keep the tank water free of toxic buildups. In Aquaponics, the systems of hydroponics and aquaculture are combined to grow plants and fish together in one integrated system allowing the nutrient rich water from the fish to be pumped to a hydroponic system to provide a food source for the growing plants and the plants in turn provide a natural filter that removes harmful properties from the water which is then returned to the fish in the aquaculture system. Aquaponics is actually a complete ecosystem unto itself where both plants and fish thrive with no waste being thrown off to pollute the earth’s eco system. Aquaponics is the ideal answer to aquaculturist’s problem of disposing of nutrient rich water and the hydroponic growers’ whose need for nutrient rich water to raise their plants is made available. “DIY Aquaponics”  recommends a simple, efficient, flood and drain systems that use medium filled grow beds for backyard growers. Although this is not the only systems available it is by far the simplest to set up for beginners, especially for home users. Aquaponics uses no chemicals, requires one tenth of the water needed for field plant production and only a fraction of the water that is used for fish culture. (Aquaculture) This style is simple in its operation; water from the fish tanks complete with waste, rich in nutrients is pumped into the grow beds filled with the hydroponic medium of your choice. Plant roots growing in that medium extract the nutrients from the water; the water is then pumped back to the fish cleaned where it is freshly oxygenated with air pumped through aeration systems in place in the tanks. The fish water rich in its nutrients is pumped to the grow beds where it is evenly distributed by a simple system of pipes. The nutrients in the water feeds the plants being produced such as tomatoes, cucumbers, lettuce and other green leafy vegetables and herbs as it filters through the grow bed medium which can consist of such mediums as professionally manufactured clay pellets or gravel, round river stones etc.  It is then returned to the fish tank via a gravity fed system or it can be pumped back to the fish tanks. The water returned is cleaned and ready for use by the fish.  In a properly set up Aquaponics system, the water will stay Ph balanced and remain crystal clear. The recycled water remains in continuous circulation except for a small amount added weekly or as needed to compensate for evaporation and transpiration by the vegetables. Because of this process, Aquaponics uses only about 1/10 of the water required for traditional gardening or fish farming. There is no doubt in this writer’s opinion, Aquaponics is the future of home gardening and commercially produced fresh food for a dry land use in the US especially in arid states such as Arizona, New Mexico, Nevada and parts of Texas.  Aquaponics can produce a literal garden of Eden in the deserts of America and other parts of the world.  It is a balanced, self-contained eco-system that can help third world countries produce food for the multitudes. Absolutely no chemicals are needed whatsoever, the system being totally organic in its operation.  In fact, chemicals cannot be sprayed or added to the vegetable part of the system because it would leech into the water which is returned to the fish causing a complete fish kill. Plant pests are kept to a minimum by housing the system in green houses stocked with nature’s own insecticide; Lacewings, Lady Bugs, Praying Mantis and others where eventually a natural balance is achieved. Earthworms can be raised using the heavy waste from the fish which will accumulate in the lowest part of the fish tanks for food along with cast off leaves from certain vegetables being raised such as lettuce etc.  The worms can then be feed to the fish and the earthworm compost can be sold to the public for use in their garden or perhaps planter box gardens or flower beds. Americans and others around the world are now beginning to understand and embrace the simple technology of Aquaponics and it is beginning to receive the well deserved renaissance it deserves. As a commercial venture, aquaponics, though still in its infancy and taking into consideration the technology developments happening world wide at this time, has the potential to be a more efficient and space saving method of producing fish, vegetables and herbs for human consumption than any other system currently available.  By incorporating aquaculture and hydroponic, growers can eliminate the cost and labor involved in mixing a fertilizer solution while drastically reducing the amount of filtration needed in re-circulating fish nutrient water. Recently, a strong interest in commercial aquaponic operations is being express more and more as an intensive method of food production. On a hobby scale, aquaponics has the potential to catch on quickly. A home aquarium with ornamental or food fish can be combined with a mini garden growing herbs, vegetables or flowers. A hobby system can serve as a beautiful show piece as well as a food production system, depending on its size. Many backyard gardeners are setting up systems to grow hundreds of pounds of fish and all the fresh vegetables their family needs. All systems recycle the water and use only approximately 10% of the water required to grow crops in the ground. Year round increased planting density producing more products in less space with a much faster maturing period. Completely chemical and pesticide free due to the use of natural predatory insects. No leaching of nutrients or waste to be pumped into the environment. Minimal Maintenance, time governed by the size of the operation. Ability to produce a large quantity of food in a small space compared to conventional in ground systems.. Grow beds can be set at a comfortable working height allowing disabled and wheelchair bound persons to be hired for part time help as needed. Preparation of grow bed medium is much simpler and less expensive than conventional soil preparation When set up correctly, aquaponic systems are very clean and neat requiring very little maintenance. Complete elimination of all soil borne diseases.  A great educational tool to teach children how to grow food and care for living things. Compared to conventional methods, aquaponic systems are very inexpensive to run. No ongoing tilling or fertilizing of the soil to produce a medium sufficient to produce a profitable crop. A year round sustainable food production at the back door for the backyard hobbyist."

You will get a 95+% germination rate rapid rooter plugs with clean dechlorinated water and about a 65 - 75% rate in aquaponic water because you have tons of critters and bacteria that love to eat the food stored in your seed. Thats why its always better to start your seeds in a separate sterile system like a grow dome or seed tray.

aquaponics,2trpac,buskitron,2,Mon Jan 26 22:08:23 2015 UTC,"I'm not an expert by any means, but your plan seems reasonable. There is one thing a little off though.  Usually in setups with a with a bell siphon, water is pumped continuously and the siphon automatically flushes the bed at regular intervals. If you have decided on running the pump on 15/45 you don't need the siphon or a standpipe, you just let the system drain during the time the pump is off."
aquaponics,2trpac,jodunc88,3,Tue Jan 27 06:02:32 2015 UTC,"Right, but the standpipe regulates the water level while the grow tray is being flooded. I just assumed that the bell siphon in a flood-and-drain cycle would allow all the water back into fish tank because the snorkel sucks up the water in the grow tray after flooding ceases, no? That way the water level in the fish tank returns to normal."
aquaponics,2trpac,jodunc88,2,Thu Jan 29 03:41:32 2015 UTC,"That's absolutely right, So you wouldn't need to ever turn the pump off in this method. If you turn the pump off you will have random levels of water in the grow bed for 45 mins out of every hour.  What I was trying to say is that you can just use a small drain hole in the bottom of the bed and get the same effect flood and drain effect without the standpipe and the siphon. If you already have designed a standpipe and siphon to fit your system, use that because it's better! You just don need to worry about the water pump being on a timer."
aquaponics,2trpac,Theosebastian,2,Sat Jan 31 15:10:25 2015 UTC,"I would look into a CHOP (constant height, one pump) system with a sump tank. It will be better for the fish because the water in the fish tank isn't fluctuating.

The general rule of thumb is to turn your tanks volume over at least once per hour. So 2 275 gallon totes equals a minimum of 550 gph. I'd size up though. Any extra gph can be used to aerate your sump or expand growbeds. I'd suggest a mag drive submersible pump of at least 750 gph. Please include filtration as well.

Anyways, I've experimented by adding an acid buffer that I got from a local fish store, which seemed to be working and brought the pH down to 7.5 and then to about 7 over time.

Biggest challenge has been how to not make it too ugly, how to make it silent (because it can be hard to watch movies or sleep if its loud) and how to make it leak-proof. As for design, I used plastic containers as grow beds that looked nice, were functional but also safe. I also used an IKEA metal structure to support the grow beds above the aquarium. For silencing, I started with siphons, then I added a makeshift silencer (a plastic bottle with the cap removed, the bottom cut off and a hole in the middle where the outlet fit in). But that was still relatively loud so I decided to just go for a constant flood system which still has enough aeration on its own without the need for an extra air pump and air stone. And finally, I used normal plumbing/gardening components to make sure there are no leaks, and added some redirecting plastic bags to were there were some leaks (which doesn't look as good but at least it won't wet the wooden floor)."

aquaponics,2t7rnc,dadbrain,3,Thu Jan 22 00:32:14 2015 UTC,"One thing to be careful of with duckweed is to be certain it is dead before feeding it to the fish.

I took a class (best class EVER!) recently from the Aquaponic Store in Denver:  http://www.theaquaponicstore.com/Default.asp  And they recommend freezing the duckweed before feeding. The fish will also need a source of protein with this - blood worms, food cubes, etc. One tip I found for protein which totally passes the sniff test with me is that if you are working a freshwater tank use a salt water protein (fish in particular), this way if there are any bugs/diseases on the feeder fish (however you prepare it) they will have a very difficult time surviving in water they are not accustomed to."

aquaponics,2t8c5i,PonicWars,2,Thu Jan 22 00:09:28 2015 UTC,I'm curious if you have done water tests before and after minerlization? Have you done them before and after your water passes from anaerobic to the final stage of aerobic? Basically I'm curious what the nutrient profiles of your water is as it travels through the separate filtration processes. Since you are running separate loops do you also supplement nutrients in your towers? If I'm not mistaken your tomatoes are pure hydro without the use of your fish water. Is that true? If not how do you balance nutrient requirements between your leafy greens and your tomatoes?  Fantastic update. Wish I could swing by and lend a hand for the upgrades you do soon.  Cheers!  P.S. How's the beer down there? Pissy lager/pilsners?
aquaponics,2t8c5i,EternalNoob,3,Thu Jan 22 03:18:51 2015 UTC,"I have not done a lot of testing on the water between mineralization as for now, I am only concerned with what is recirculating on the plants.

aquaponics,2t8c5i,Whittigo,1 point,Thu Jan 22 07:58:11 2015 UTC,How efficient is removing the solid waste at cleaning the water? What are your nitrate levels like in the fish loop? I would think you'd always have some. I think I missed the filter cleaning video if you talked about it in that one sorry.  How do you flush the towers when you add more water from the fish system? I'm guessing it just goes down the drain to make room in your mineralization tanks for more water from the filters?  Also if the beer isn't great why don't you brew your own!?

aquaponics,2t7is6,olsmobile,2,Wed Jan 21 20:30:41 2015 UTC,"it is a ten gallon tank with a blue crayfish as the only stock.  the water comes out of the filter where most of it goes right into the tank but a low amount gets pumped into the cup from the bottom.  the cup has a sponge on the bottom and pumice rock from another aquarium filter.  there is a small drainage tube that runs the water back into the aquarium.  For safety's sake I put a small notch in the rim of the cup positioned over a hole in the top of the aquarium lid, just in case the return tube gets clogged and the cup starts to over flow.  If I can get this to run smoothly I am considering building a set up to go with my 55 gallon tank as well."

My dad and I have been doing DIY stuff with aquaponics(His system) and aquariums(my tanks). This link is a DIY overhead filter, which I can certainly tell you will double just fine as a slightly larger aquaponics grow bed, with the added benefit of being your filtration too. Good luck man!  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFcioRUCa6c  EDIT: If you're worried that the plants won't get the ""poo"" because of the filter floss in Joey's design, that's actually ok. Your plants really just need the nitrates, so filtering the ""poo"" out first is actually ok."

I already use a canister filter so I was thinking about diverting some of the outflow from it into something like that.  I do 15% water changes once a week to keep my nitrates just under 20ppm but I assume with the right balance I could eliminate the need for the water changes."

aquaponics,2t27fm,bigdutchman100,8,Tue Jan 20 16:10:01 2015 UTC,"My advise when it comes to creating a large system is to treat it like two separate systems. Aquaculture and hydroponics. Where you have the ability to completely separate them. There is a guy local to me that built a pretty big system (4 1,000 gallon tanks and 2 100 foot long DWC beds). He failed at the fish part and is now trying to retrofit into a hydroponics setup to hopefully keep going. If the system were designed that way from the get go he could have kept producing something. It would also allow you to optimize systems for individual needs.  Research the ""dual loop"" system by Paul Van der Werf (Earthan Group)."
aquaponics,2t27fm,EternalNoob,4,Tue Jan 20 17:22:14 2015 UTC,Here's some good info on Paul's dual loop.   Fellow APN member building the world's biggest commercial AP system? System idea based on Pauls Dual loop

aquaponics,2t27fm,EternalNoob,6,Wed Jan 21 04:23:36 2015 UTC,"He failed for a number of reasons the biggest of which was extremely poor system design.   -Lack of any biological filtration.  -Lack of any solids filtration.  -Fishtanks drained to DWC beds without filtration and then to sump. From the sump the water was pumped to the fishtanks which basically ground up any solids that made it through the DWC into finer particles degrading water quality.  -Initially there was little if any aeration in any part of the system. He later added air stones to the fishtanks.  -He was unable to balance nutrient needs for the plants while maintaining water quality for the fish.  It was a terrible design basically. One which was ""designed"" by ""professionals"" that travel around the world setting up systems.   And no. You would utilize 2 separate sump tanks so that you can completely decouple the systems.  RANT INCOMING!  Recirculating aquaculture is a science that has proven to be viable and successful on a commercial scale.    Hydroponics is a science that has proven to be viable and successful on a commercial scale.   Aquaponics as a science has proven to work but on a commercial scale (you're talking about producing $30,000 in produce) they are few and far between. And the ones that do work and profit are pretty hush hush as to their methods. You'll find as you dig deeper into this ""hobby"" that the vast majority of ""commercial"" systems out there are funded from grants, teaching classes, writing books, selling kits or investors that end up losing their money in quick fashion.   I'm not saying to not do this. I'm saying to do your homework. For the majority of us dumping a couple bucks into a system to tinker with and to hopefully get some good food out of it's not a big deal if we fail. What you're proposing is a completely different game. Especially if other people throw their money at it. Read every word of the threads linked above. And check out Chatterson Farms too. I think we'll see big things from him. He's pretty hush hush about his system but you can glean some very good info.  P.S. I would like to say that even the ""big"" system I'm building now doesn't fit with the criteria I've posted above. If I were to start over (which I wish I could) I would certainly change some things.   I would also like to suggest that you start small. Get your feet wet. My first system is based on a 50 gallon aquarium with a 30 gallon growbed over it. It's in its 3rd winter and has supplied me with endless amounts of basil with virtually zero maintenance. Just jump in and get your feet wet before diving in and run the risk of knocking yourself out on the bottom of the pool."

aquaponics,2t27fm,Pastelitomaracucho,5,Tue Jan 20 17:00:53 2015 UTC,"This is in my opinion one of the few ways aquaponics can be viable. Those prices seem astronomical :), and the VERY first thing commercial growers often miss is to have an already established client base. You have it. It can be done.   First question that comes to mind is, where are you going to get heat from? Do you have any affordable source of heat? If that is sorted out, the system's electrical consumption can be quite low. I often use pumps that move 18 cubic meters per hour @ 0.5 KWh.  If you have a successful restaurant and you would like to sell your fish, I strongly suggest you include off-flavour purging tanks. Better not take chances with tainted fish.   A commercial system will be different from a backyard one in terms of filtration capacity: the system has to be able to cope with changes in crops and feeding regimes and needs to be sturdy/ergonomic enough so you don't spend a big deal of time maintaining it.   I built a commercial system in a tropical greenhouse using waste heat from a glass factory. Search for troppenghaus Klein Eden on YouTube.   I started my own little consultancy firm 6 months ago and we work with aquaponics and RAS. Feel free to contact me to chat about this further."
aquaponics,2t27fm,EternalNoob,2,Tue Jan 20 19:33:49 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the input.    I want to reduce the heat usage primarily through design.  I want to dig 6 feet down to gain the earths natural heat, then also use extreme solar mass techniques to conserve heat.    Many of the crops I want to grow require Media Beds, do you think this is viable on a large scale?"
aquaponics,2t27fm,denshi,3,Wed Jan 21 04:20:56 2015 UTC,"Cool! Geothermal heat pumps are the most efficient way but are a bit expensive. Check if your state offers some energy efficiency schemes that can help you out.   Regarding grow beds, yes, you can even use a combination of grow baskets and deep rafts, for example. I know that microgreens and leafy plants do great in rafts. Basil is an exceptional case with well-documented research. In my own experience, lemon grass and cilantro grow super fast in grow beds  Rafts will store the heat better that growing beds, too.  The most important thing in a commercial system is proper control of the suspended matter as in any intensive fish farm using recirculation. In last-generation AP systems, the whole design just resembles an intensive fish farm with a coupled plant loop. This is how we did it in Germany without even being aware of how advanced the design was simply because I am an aquaculture engineer using principles that have existed for many years. These principles are finally being used in large AP systems.   The only little annoyance I saw with grow beds is that the hydroton eventuality breaks down and ends up everywhere unless you design a proper system to sieve it out. Again, no biggie."
aquaponics,2t27fm,denshi,2,Wed Jan 21 06:12:07 2015 UTC,"Why do you say many of the things you want to grow require media beds? The only things I can think of that require them are trees and root crops. You'll never compete with soil grown rootcrops. All of the plants you listed in your OP will grow well in DWC. I'd skip the mint though. Grow that in a big pot and water it with your AP water.  And no. Media beds are not viable for commercial use unless you get the media (and labor to install it) for just about free. I just filled 2 4'x8'x12"" media beds with lava rock (much cheaper than hydroton!) and it cost me $250 plus the labor of 4 people rinsing and dumping into the beds for 4+ hours."

aquaponics,2t27fm,highflyer83,2,Wed Jan 21 04:17:18 2015 UTC,"You will most likely need a small heater to help the plants in the winter. If you go LED, they won't be producing any heat so don't rely on that. If you are dead set on heating with passive solar, you should cover up the glass with insulation every night to prevent freezing. Hell, do that even if you have a small heater. Foam board work well and can be cut to size fairly easily. There are also automatic options for this but they cost some money."
aquaponics,2t27fm,the_nin_collector,0,Wed Jan 21 14:43:18 2015 UTC,"Heating can be tricky, yes. If you go with a greenhouse, it would be possible to run something like this:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket_mass_heater  This is what I plan on doing with my big outdoor greenhouse (one day, many moons down the road), it seems like a good way to help with heating, and if you pipe that creatively, you could get away with radiant heat from the water too.

aquaponics,2t3r6z,ScholarSloth,1 point,Tue Jan 20 22:51:33 2015 UTC,I found the forum thread that goes along with that pic here.  Looks to me like there are several more components to the system.  Anyways. I don't like it. First there is the cost (in $$$ and time). All those tee's add up quick. I think a simple nft system with cheap solo cups would be cheaper and probably work better.  Something like this.
aquaponics,2t3r6z,EternalNoob,1 point,Tue Jan 20 23:07:38 2015 UTC,What about the roots being submerged? Do you know anything about that technique?
aquaponics,2t3r6z,EternalNoob,2,Wed Jan 21 03:28:12 2015 UTC,What do you mean by submerged? Like in a deep water culture system? They work great. As do nutrient film techniques. They both have there pluses and minuses.   DWC you get to utilize a larger body of water which can make your system less prone to stress due to heat and can potentially allow you to run a higher stocking density in your fish tank due to the huge volume of water. It is a very heavy system and somewhat expensive per plant hole to set up. Most advice points to the need for aeration in the bed too which is an additional cost and maintenance issue.  NFT is great because it's low cost and low weight. Much easier to build at a level that's easy for you to work at. Since it's a system that uses a much smaller volume of water (per plant hole) it is very susceptible to heat changes.   Both systems require much better solids filtration than a media bed. I think that's a plus. Some people would disagree.  Here is a decent primer on the major hydroponics techniques used today. WARNING FOR PDF!

aquaponics,2sziut,El_Harde,6,Mon Jan 19 22:50:19 2015 UTC,"If your tap water is at 7.4 but then rises to 8.2, you need to figure out what is causing the rise before you try to lower it.  pH should naturally lower itself as part of the nitrification cycle, so if it's increasing then you probably have some source of carbonates in your system.  Eliminate the cause of the rise, and it will fall on its own."
aquaponics,2sziut,paradoxbomb,3,Mon Jan 19 23:31:47 2015 UTC,you probably have some source of carbonates in your system   which is more than likely to be the grow media - what did you use OP? You need to test to see if this is the cause.
aquaponics,2sziut,col381,1 point,Tue Jan 20 02:22:58 2015 UTC,"Sorry for the late response on this, I am using Hydroton and soil (separated by burlap and the soil is above my water levels in the raft).

aquaponics,2sziut,SpaceButler5,3,Tue Jan 20 03:06:28 2015 UTC,I thought PH rising after off gassing water (has dissolved co2 straight from tap) was normal? or just not that great of a rise is normal?
aquaponics,2sziut,Kreetch,3,Tue Jan 20 03:10:42 2015 UTC,Peat can be used to lower the ph.
aquaponics,2sziut,paradoxbomb,2,Tue Jan 20 04:50:27 2015 UTC,"Well we got some promising news last night, the pH dropped to 8.0. I believe what's happening is my tank is cycling again with the rafts being introduced (1 week now with live plants). I am doing dual root growing with my herbs, maybe when I was soaking my burlap, net pots, blue foam I didn't get it all clean 100%.  You all have brought some good ideas to me - working the drift wood sounds too time consuming so I'm going to stay the course with water changes and time.  I live in very high elevations (8500+ft), so I'm a little confused with the CO2, would this be injected in to the water directly? Sounds counter productive with the O2 being pushed.  I thought that peat was for raising pH?"
aquaponics,2sziut,PotentPonics,2,Tue Jan 20 15:13:02 2015 UTC,"Sounds like good news.  CO2 lowers pH when it dissolves in the water, creating carbonic acid.  Some hydroponics setups use this technique. Peat will lower pH as it is a natural source of humic acid."
aquaponics,2sziut,PotentPonics,2,Tue Jan 20 20:22:21 2015 UTC,"Your ideal cycling ph is 7.4 - 7.6 any way. Your bacteria will greatly benefit from the extra carbonates during cycling. You don't need to worry about your ph too much until your system is almost cycled unless its very low. The ammonia in your system is also less toxic at a higher ph as well, which means fewer bacteria die from high ammonia levels. If your PH is still high after cycling use phosphoric acid based PH down."
aquaponics,2sziut,Aquaponics-Heretic,0,Tue Jan 20 17:37:11 2015 UTC,"phosphoric acid   Have you ever tried Microbe Life Hyroponics pH down? It is using phosphoric acid as its base.   I was talking with my local Hydroshop owner last night, and she was wondering if Humic or Citric would work too. I haven't put too much searching in to those questions yet, especially seeing my pleasant surprise last night with the lowering pH."
aquaponics,2sziut,PotentPonics,2,Tue Jan 20 17:51:35 2015 UTC,Citric acid is antimicrobial and is not ok.  Humic acid is ok but it depends on dose. Phosphoric acid is nice because you add phosphate and lower PH. Most aquaponic systems quickly strip out phosphate at least if there are alot of flowering plants. This is why people end up with tomatoes with few flowers with normal nitrates. There tomatoes blast through the phosphates depleting them faster than the fish generate them. Aside from that phosphoric acid is used in both candy and soft drinks and other food and is safe for plants fish bacteria and most other creatures when dosed properly.
aquaponics,2sziut,Aquaponics-Heretic,1 point,Tue Jan 20 18:25:49 2015 UTC,Phosphoric acid is also really good for growing algae.. especially ina new cycling system...  Use Muriatic Acid instead.... Hydrochloric Acid... and treat your top up water...not your fish tank

aquaponics,2sy7ht,barneytighe,1 point,Mon Jan 19 20:17:13 2015 UTC,Thanks for your reply. To clarify - the drawing I linked to is one I found online and that I am somewhat basing my design on.   I am now leaning towards having one larger Grow Bed vs Three Smaller Grow beds - it will be a lot simpler.   Thanks-
aquaponics,2sy7ht,Yipie,1 point,Mon Jan 19 20:50:42 2015 UTC,"So we can talk on the same page - I'm going to reference this page. (If you have a different reference, please link away, so we can talk more about what you want and how to get you there. It's a random aquaponics page that looks like it describes the basic setups well.)   That page links (3) systems: Flood/Drain; Continuous Flow & CHIFT-PIST. From what ""I"" know, you will need to pick one of the 1st two setups for how you setup your system. This will dictate how to setup your the drains in your grow beds; the media to use; etc. The CHIFT-PIST is a variation that will add a sump tank to either configuration. (Now to get fun here, I have seen a 4th style on some of you larger setups on Youtube, where they add a bio/media filter to pull out the fish solids. This is placed in-between the tank and the grow beds.)   For feeding multiple beds, you'll want valves you can limit the flow individually to each of the beds. In this setup you'll want a bypass pipe at the end of the line that drains directly in to your sump tank. This will protect your pump if your pump pumps out more water then you want flowing in to your beds. This will also allow you to shut off the water to any bed, but still allow water to flow to the others."
aquaponics,2sy7ht,Yipie,1 point,Tue Jan 20 09:09:30 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the link and the reply. After spending hours online yesterday and today I have a better understanding the different systems.   My remaining question is around the CHIFT PIST system design (that matches the one in your link). Is the water being pumped from the Sump Tank to the Fish tank being pumped continuously or on a timer?  Also, isn't the point of pumping the FT water into the Grow Beds so that the fish solids act as a fertilizer of sorts for the plants? Or are the solids really something that optimally should be removed from the system?  Thanks-"
aquaponics,2sy7ht,Yipie,2,Tue Jan 20 16:28:31 2015 UTC,"For the pump - Most systems I've run the pump continuously. This is done both to eliminate the hassle/failure point of adding a timer on to the pump, but also because with a slight modification on the feed pipe you can have the return pipe help airiate the water.   For your second question I'm going to say - Yes. :p This is really going to be more of a question of 'where' and 'how' to you want to use the fish waste.   Dumping directly in to the grow beds means that occasionally you will need to clean/wash your grow media out otherwise it can get too full. (Most numbers I see is once every 6 months to a year for this.) Yes the waste acts like fertilizer, but there will be WAY to much for plants to deal with, so you'll see worms pop up to help break it down.   If you pull the waste out of the water before it reaches the grow bed, then you're looking at a 10 minute process once a week or so for maintenance there. The beds can go MUCH longer without needing to be cleaned out though. (Depends here, on how good you are a cleaning out the roots when you pull plants out.) The other possible advantage of this way is that you can now use the fish waste better.   Two biggest uses I've seen for the fish waste is either a controlled worm farm/compost pile, with kitchen scraps added, using the worms for supplemental fish food; or for use directly in growing potted plants, either as fertilizer or part of the soil mixture.   Hope this helps, and best of luck to you."
aquaponics,2sx9eu,madcat21,5,Mon Jan 19 10:22:24 2015 UTC,Have you found an Ammonia sensor to use? Some of us arduino fans have been talking about this for awhile and there never seems to be any realistic options.
aquaponics,2sx9eu,cocacholas,3,Mon Jan 19 18:31:34 2015 UTC,"Hi, I'm one of the project partners and the electrical/sensor guy.   It was very hard to find an ammonia sensor. You can get them to detect ammonia gas, but that doesn't work in water (duh). What we found was a Seachem Amonia Alert pad. You put it in your fish tank and it changes color according to the ammonia concentrations in the water. There are 4 levels: safe, alert, danger and poisonous. We put a color sensor (tcs2300) next to the pad to meassure the color and if it reads one of the dangerous colors, then you will receive a notification on the app.  It's simply just hacking a sensor, but it's not very accurate.

aquaponics,2sx9eu,datthepirate,1 point,Mon Jan 19 18:32:20 2015 UTC,"You generally want to add the solids filter before the growbed to keep it clean (If not, the growbed can get very nasty result of the fish wate), keep in mind that the filter could be innecesary if your stock of fish is light, but its always good to have some filter to get a more cleaner water and avoid solids accumulation (That can make anaerobic zones, plant deterioration and even death fish)  About the type of filter, i have read a lot of test and documents and the radial flow filter seems to work better than others, and its very easy to build, you just need to look at the water flow and the water capacity of the filter tank to get the proper rate.

aquaponics,2sx9eu,CocksOnMyWaffles,1 point,Tue Jan 20 07:54:18 2015 UTC,"Project member here, hope someone can help us figuring out the fish situation. We have heard and read so many different things that were contradictory.   So according to some papers we need to run 60-100g of fish food per sqm growing area; at 0.3 sqm that's around 18-30g. The fish eat 1-2% of their weight every day which means that we need 900g (almost 2 lbs) of fish, right?   According to some sources we need at least 10l per lbs of fish. And here comes my question. We have 120l but people at the aquarium shop said that we can't keep 2lbs of fish since the aquarium is too small. What now?   Also, can anyone recommend a certain type of fish that would suit the size of our setup? We really wanted koi but the dude at the fish shop said there is no way we will fit more than 3 4-inch koi in those tanks.   I hope you guys can help us and thanks for snooping in!"
aquaponics,2sx9eu,limowrecks,1 point,Mon Jan 19 20:05:21 2015 UTC,"Are you sure it's not 10 gallons per pound of fish?  Also, people at aquarium shops don't know much when it comes to aquaponics. They are going off guidelines on simple/small charcoal filters in aquarium pumps. Not a giant grow-bed of filtering plants and bacterial culture.  I did a little experiment in my basement one winter with 150L tank and about 10-15 somewhat large (3-4 inch length) goldfish. The plants grew and everything seemed to work. However, I had issues with the stone I chose for my grow-bed as it must have had limestone or something in it and kept increasing my PH. I gave up fighting the PH so eventually the plants stopped growing properly. Point is though that 10-15 small fish in 150L worked well. I suggest having plenty more water than fish. It's the amount of plants vs fish that really matters."
aquaponics,2sx9eu,RikkityRekt,1 point,Mon Jan 19 22:28:43 2015 UTC,"You are getting different data because the fish stock depends of a big variety of factors, including your oxigenation levels, water qty, number of plants... their size... but i think the most important is the growing bed area.  If i remember well, you can put .5kg of fish per 20lt of water, so in you 120lt tank you should put 3kg of fish (6 fishies). Remember that this depends of your oxigenation, type of fish and other things. For every .5kg of fish you should put about .10cm2 of growing area, so a square meter its enough. (Minimal of .6m)  Try to not get recomendations from the aquarium shops, because they keep fish for ornamental purposes, and AP its  more like aquaculture, triying to grow fish nice and fast. Never use chemicals and aquarium medicine because they are not suitable for human consumption (I read somewhere that they are even consider carcinogens).  The koi could get very big, so maybe the aquarium guy is right, you can use goldfish if you have a small tank. If the koi are small you can use them, but you shoul consider getting a bigger tank for when they grow.  Cause you are on the stage of test and experimentation, i would recommend some goldfish or another hard fish like tilapia. The first days could be very hard for the fish (Cause ammonia and nitrites) and if you put sensible species they can die easily, besides the koi are more expensive!.  You can PM if you have further questions."

Spinosad is 100% safe for people and fish.  The most common brand is Monterey garden insect spray.  You can probably find it at any local gardening store or hydroponic shop.  It's even sold at home depot up here, so it's pretty widely available.  It's super effective when sprayed every three days for two weeks.  Spinosad is pretty much the only thing that takes out thrips effectively. You need to skip a few days between applications in order to interrupt the lifecycle of the insects.  After about a week of usage will notice an immediate burst in growth from your plants do to life no longer being sucked out of them.   Even though it's safe, I still recommend you wash food thoroughly before consuming it.  To free to ask me any questions you may have."

aquaponics,2stmnq,LexGray,4,Sun Jan 18 14:37:06 2015 UTC,"I think it is unlikely but the fact is that the fry survived in that environment. I don't know how old it is, but from the lengths I placed in the picture you should be able to estimate how big the fry is (about 1cm length) and how old it is. From what i've gathered, it should be between 2 weeks to 3-4 weeks when the fry starts showing colour. From the description in Hydroponics Indoor Horticulture (page 16), and the pictures I took of the pests, they do appear to be thrips. The only way they indicate is using biological pest control, which I didn't have access to. I suspect that might have gotten there from when I added the original media (the lava rocks were sitting outside in a farm) or when I placed some herb from soil to the system. The storage containers I have are made of PP, which according to this website (which compares different types of plastic for gardening use) is generally regarded as a safe choice for gardening."

aquaponics,2ssrcr,fnkychkn,2,Sun Jan 18 03:30:40 2015 UTC,This means your flow rate into your growbed is too high. Does your pump have a flow adjustment on it? If so reduce it until the water is only shooting out about an inch past the spout in your growbed.
aquaponics,2ssrcr,frisketdog,1 point,Sun Jan 18 23:19:16 2015 UTC,"This is really hard to explain with only text.  But TL;DR, the auto-siphon should drain the grow bed in just a few minutes, break suction when the grow bed is drained, and stop draining until the bed is full again.  More complicated explanation:   When a system is working correctly, the system will fill slowly and drain quickly.  The auto-siphon has an inner pipe stem standing up and an outer pipe - called the bell - that allows water to enter through the bottom only.  (The inner pipe stem usually has a wide opening that reduces down to a more narrow pipe.  That reduction encourages suction when the siphon action starts.)  When the grow bed fills with enough water to pour over the top of the inner pipe, suction action starts and quickly sucks all water out of the grow be.  (Water flows in from the bottom of the outer pipe/bell, up through the outer pipe and down through the inner pipe.)  So if your system is doesn't stop draining, it might not be breaking suction.  Many systems have a small PVC joint on the the end of the drain spout which can be used to adjust the amount of back pressure as water drains.  It can take a lot of work to dial it all in, but you'll be able to make it work.  YouTube has videos to help you troubleshoot your auto-siphon."

Their system looks really good but it is run on chemicals.  it only provides 2% of the food that Disney sells and costs them 4 times as much as their suppliers.  But as the girl that was running it told me.  It is part of the park and is a high value visiting item.  Only a small area has real aquaponics and they are having to rebuild it over and over again.  The fish on display are not hooked to the plants at all and instead are on loan from supply houses for breeding.  I was extremely disappointed when I got to remove the curtain and really see what they were doing.  The airconditioning system was really nice.  They used cardboard that was wet constantly and run fans from outside over them.  That was their cooling.  The chemicals they use would kill any fish that used the same water and some of the staff think that may be why they are having some of the issues with the real aquaponic system they have in the corner.  They do have some amazing items like square melons and the largest tomato TREE in the world.  But the staff have to wear special gear just to walk near the plants and the sand they are in can't be touched by a person or it kills entire areas. They do allow people to stand on a safe area and dispense some lady bugs on the plants. They use a lot of them to control any pests. Plus they keep it very much sealed.  using fans to control the air so more air is pushed out and none can come in.  I learned a lot so I am glad I paid the exta money to do it. But most of the stuff only works because of the chemicals (which are very expensive)

Ever thought of digging a 3ft deep ditch a couple yards long that you run PVC through and cover with dirt. Use the earth as a heat sink to bring some of that water temp down? If you are automating your systems, you could have a thermostat in your tank with an arduino ready to open a bypass valve that sends water down the pipe and back before reentering the tank or something like that."

My well established setup (~500 gal) killed off my catfish.  My 2yro blue channel catfish died last night, but the two Koi survived (but are unhappy and sluggish).  All 15 of them died. 6 of them at 18"". About 50 lbs of catfish. I was going to eat them at the end of this month too...  Water was low (about 220 gal), and power went out (GCFI tripped) during a rain storm, which stopped the pump and the airstone. Maybe 12 hrs. I fed them last night (in the dark), and I heard them thrash like they normally do when they eat, but I didnt get a visual on them for signs of ill health.  Postmortem chemistry: pH 6,  Nitrite 0.25,   Ammonia 0.5,  Phosphates 10+  Not enough dissolved O2?  EDIT: Looks like a tree fell next door (business) and pulled the power/telephone lines going into their place.  Im wondering what kind of contribution that had...

Even if you got it to cycle through the fish pen to keep up the 02. The plants would be fine for days without water, I think.    [+1] Chamahawk:    Sorry to hear that.  Nothing in the chemistry would cause a mass kill like that.  That's absolutely low DO.

Heaps of surface turbulence.  I've been fishkeeping for over 20 years and never had a heater fail like this but i've heard about it from my aquarium clubs.  Figured it was just people with shitty heaters but this was a nice jager, although it was about 6 years old.  Really with my temperate climate I should just forego the heater altogether, I was just being greedy since Jade Perch grow quicker with temps in the 30s"
aquaponics,2shopj,Aquaponics-Heretic,2,Thu Jan 15 08:01:41 2015 UTC,So let me get this straight...  You have a 1000L fish tank being constantly heated to 30 degrees C??
aquaponics,2shopj,Optimoprimo,1 point,Thu Jan 15 08:21:17 2015 UTC,"no, I have a 1000L IBC with a 200L sump, with a minimum temp of 26'C"
aquaponics,2shopj,ThisNerdyGuy,-1,Thu Jan 15 10:55:45 2015 UTC,So the normal temp in your 1000L tank is 26 C...  And being summer you've probably been averaging 30 C during the day... and 22 C overnight.... then had a day of 40+....  And you don't think your tank water temp was 30+??  Sorry but IMO your fish died from a combination of heat stress related organ failure and oxygen deprevation...
aquaponics,2shopj,Aquaponics-Heretic,2,Thu Jan 15 11:01:58 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure I understand you.  The heater malfunctioned, the thermometer on the tank was reading 46 celcius.  Jade Perch are fine in the 30's, stressed in the upper 30's, but I don't know of a single native australian fresh water fish that can live at 46 celcius.  I agree, oxygen is a huge contributor to the cause of death, but it wouldn't be a problem if the temperature hadn't soared.  Again, i'm here to learn so if you can educate me on what i'm missing her i'd be thrilled.  All i'm seeing is a heater malfunctioning which brought the fish into a zone they can't live in, ergo (as suggested by you) dropping the dissolved oxygen levels too low."

Luckily there is absolutely no way the system could get that hot without a malfunction like what I experienced, the hottest it has ever got in recorded history in my city is 42'C (108'F) - and it would take a long time for that ambient temp to effect 1000L (265 gallons) of water sitting in the shade."

aquaponics,2sft5c,highflyer83,3,Wed Jan 14 20:40:45 2015 UTC,"Sounds like it will work fine, but keep in mind that holes can clog and timers can break.  Bell siphons are finicky to get working at first because they depend on balancing input and output flow rates, but once balanced they should work flawlessly. Mine has anyway.  So it's hard to say which is better or worse without a ton of testing. I went with the bell siphon to eliminate the timer but it's not like your setup won't work the way you described."
aquaponics,2sft5c,paradoxbomb,3,Wed Jan 14 21:14:06 2015 UTC,"Seconding the on off nature of timers being bad. It will wear out much faster than having the pump constantly on. There are ways to make flood and drain work without a bell siphon and the pump constantly on, weighted levers for example, but I'm not familiar enough with them. Just be aware that your assumption of the bell siphon being a point of failure is correct, but so is the timer. A bell siphon not triggering can be fixed with adjusting an existing ball valve, or cleaning the siphon. A blown pump can only be fixed by buying a new pump. Just a matter of what risk you want to choose."

Just drill two opposing holes at the base of the standpipe.. so that the bed slow drains during the timer off period...  If you have multiple holes drilled in the standpipe... you'll effectively have to have a higher rated pump flow rate to fill the bed....  And to those that say that timers are bad, fail frequently, wear the pump out quicker... rubbish... none of the above has been demonstrated to be true over the decade that I, and 1000's of others have operated timed F&D systems...  In fact I've seen more cases of pumps failing in continuously pumped siphoned systems posted on forums... than timer or pump failures in timed F&D...  And I wish I had a dollar for every time someone has posted my siphons wont start/stop... or have suddenly stoped working... :D  Regardless.. in a small grow bed such as a cut barrel.... why take up the space in the grow bed for a standpipe/siphon and gravel guard anyway...  Use an external loop siphon... simple and reliable as all hell... my first system, with loop siphons ran continuously and flawlessly for nearly 8 years before I had to move the system.... if I put it back together, it'd work flawlessly again from day one..."
aquaponics,2sft5c,Whittigo,2,Thu Jan 15 07:56:38 2015 UTC,"I'll agree with you on siphons being reliable.   As far as the timer thing, I think it entirely depends on what pump you buy. I'll always assume someone is going to buy the cheapest pump they can, and some manufacturers I just don't trust to use quality components. Switching on and off frequently has historically been one of the biggest points of failures for electrical hardware, but for the past decade or so it seems much less so. There are some good quality components out there, but if you spend as little as possible I simply wouldn't trust the pump or timer. I'll assume the worst so all surprises are pleasant."
aquaponics,2sft5c,Aquaponics-Heretic,2,Thu Jan 15 13:17:38 2015 UTC,"Historically I'd agree with you...  But timed flood & drain usually requires an uprated pump.. to achieve the hourly turn over rate... usually a solids rated dirty water pump..  It's actually more likely that cheaper lower wattage, lower quality pond pumps are employed in siphoned systems....  ;)"
aquaponics,2sft5c,froschkonig,2,Thu Jan 15 22:43:51 2015 UTC,"On off timing on a pump can wear it out faster but other than that once you get the right flow rate  to drain speed ratio down so that as much water is out as possible it should be fine  Edit: if you're going to downvote me, at least say what you disagree with.

aquaponics,2sdzej,Waywoah,9,Wed Jan 14 10:18:56 2015 UTC,"This is my current setup: https://imgur.com/jWhna0n  Tank is a 20G tall I picked up for free from a coworker.  Filtration is achieved with an air pump ($15) + undergravel filter ($10).  There's a cheapo automatic rotary feeder ($15) behind the plants.  A Glo dual-T5 aquarium light ($100+) hooked up with a cheapo rotary light timer ($5).  Gravel is just plain aquarium gravel, whatever neutral rock stuff they had at the aquarium store.  Fish are White Cloud Mountain Minnows.  I started with 6, now I have 14?  They are supposedly hard to breed but mine do.  I picked up two Chinese Algae Eaters a few months ago to help keep the tank clean, and they do.  Very little algae grows in the tank.  I also have some Java Moss which I occasionally clearcut because it will take over the tank.  The plants are just little basil plants.  I cut a thin styrofoam slab, cut holes in it, inserted some coconut fiber rooting blocks from a local hydroponics store, droped in some basil seeds, and now I just keep them trimmed back (else they get tall and lanky).  This system requires almost zero maintenance.  I top up the water every other week and fill the feeder once a month or so.  I have a very busy/irregular life and schedule for the next few years, so the system needed to be as simple and automated as possible.  It has been stable for about 2 years, with 1 move (and 1 water change associated with that move....sucks to transport that much water through a major move).  This system is heavily nitrate-limited.  The filtration on the bottom is extremely good, and leaves very little nitrogen for anything else.  The java moss grows slowly, and you an see that the basil is yellowish and not doing all that well.  So, despite all the fish, there really isn't much fish pee for the plants.  Accordingly, I sometimes add some seaweed fertilizer to give things a boost.  However, I'm in school right now, and it is all a bit haphazard.  Here you can see the detail of the plant raft as well as the fish feeder, which spun as I was writing this so you can see the goldfish flakes on the water: https://imgur.com/NKzCYzO  edit: speling"
aquaponics,2sdzej,cjastram,3,Wed Jan 14 13:28:12 2015 UTC,"Yeah, pretty much. Some people have a daily--weekly--monthly sort of checklist. This is an example, and by no means exhaustive  Daily: Visually check system (no spills, blockages, damage, fish fatalities, etc), feed fish  Weekly: pH, water quality readings, fish check, weekly plant care/harvest (?)  Monthly: Add water, harvest plants, make longer term adjustments  That's assuming you aren't taking lots of notes or whatever. But you might find yourself engaged with and hanging out by the system a lot more, cause it's awesome and you made it.  They're all pretty easy to maintain, but a Deep Water Culture setup is definitely the easiest to build. Less to go wrong with it and not as hard to fine tune (bell siphons are tricky). I still prefer Ebb and Flow systems, as they get better oxygenation and water mixing.   Have fun!"

If you want to see the fish, a large proper fish tank might be good (I've seen them for around $1/gallon), but you'll get lots of algae which can mean lots of trouble for your fish (it can swing your dissolved oxygen and pH throughout the day/night).

Intermediate bulk containers are stackable containers mounted on a pallet that are designed to be moved using a forklift or a pallet jack. IBCs have a volume range that is situated between drums and tanks, hence the term ""intermediate“. The most common sizes are 1,040 liters or 275 U.S. gallons or 229 imperial gallons and 1,250 liters or 330 U.S. gallons or 275 imperial gallons (the 1040 liter IBCs are often listed as being 1000 liters). Cube shaped IBCs give a particularly good utilization of storage capacity compared to palletized drums - one 275 gallon IBC is equivalent to five 55-US-gallon (208 L; 46 imp gal) drums, and a 330 gallon IBC is equivalent to six 55 gallon drums.

I'd say just don't get frustrated with yourself and try to keep your patience. I'm like you - working with extremely limited time and resources.   Based on the conversations I've had at the shop, a lot of people get gung-ho right away, drop thousands on equipment for a huge system and give up after they realize it's hard.   Start small and chip away at it little by little until you find something that works. I'm pretty fucking terrible at science and engineering, so I know if I can figure out how to work a small cheap system I can someday have the knowledge to make a bigger, more elaborate system."

I put in a 60 watt fluorescent bulb (not nearly strong enough). Like I said, fucking terrible at science and engineering.   The result: Seedlings sprouting horizontally towards the light with extremely long and flimsy stems.   I eventually went to target and bought an organizer bin and drilled a hole in the top for the light fixture. I replaced the bulb with a 125 watt CFL bulb.   It's working out alright, but I'll probably add another light or upgrade to an LED."
aquaponics,2s8c3i,TheCrash84,2,Tue Jan 13 02:22:17 2015 UTC,"I've found the biggest factors in keeping fish alive are making sure they are highly oxygenated and fed the right amount so your plants can keep the nitrates low.  Nitrates cause stress and greatly increase the risk of disease, even if they don't directly contribute.  Bubbler's go a long way for low energy.  Also, two fish for that plant and space ratio is overkill, but you'll probably be fine as long as you just BARELY feed them  (I wish I had numbers for you, but systems that small are pretty darn hard to gauge).  Goldfish are pretty nasty fish when it comes to putting off tons of waste.  Hope you have a chemical testing kit, because keeping a system that small in check is tough even with weekly testing.  Best of luck!  Also, consider doing weekly water changes and using the water for household plants if you're high on nitrates.  Just make sure you dechlorinate the water before adding it back to your system.  The most surefire way to dechlroinate is to buy some pure ascorbic acid and look up the chemical equation to figure out the amount needed.  The benefit of pure vitC is that going over a bit actually helps boost your fish immune system, so all is well if you do a bit too much.  Another more time intensive processes is setting the water into direct sunlight with a bubbler in it.  If your city water has chloramate(chloramine?, chloramine? too lazy to google what it is) and many cities use the stuff.  It could take a few weeks to completely degas at room temp."
aquaponics,2s8c3i,tewls,2,Tue Jan 13 10:48:05 2015 UTC,but you'll probably be fine as long as you just BARELY feed them   That's bad advice. The tank is considered overpopulated as tank recommendations for full grown goldfish is between 55 - 75 US gallons.  He should remove the goldfish and get fish that are better suited for this setup.   Oh and it's Chloramine that you where trying to think of. Chloramine  and Chlorine are both very bad for fish and used in city water.

aquaponics,2s60r6,skuba,3,Mon Jan 12 14:32:49 2015 UTC,"Beetles have a hard exoskeleton and their shell is probably not digestible, maybe it could even hurt the tilapia's digestion. Why not save the darkling beetles to lay more mealworm eggs, and feed the fish mealworms or  pupa? If you have a large enough population of darkling beetles, thats a great supply of fresh fish nutrient supplements right there!"

Since the grow out time can go to 18 months on tilapia, you can spend your major focus on the plants and then just replace the tilapia that you have to harvest once they mature, just to keep young fish in the tank.   It's your system, feel free to do it however you like. I'm sure others here would love to hear your results regardless of your success or failure. This is a science that is being developed at the grassroots level, so there really aren't any rules as long as the system produces and can stay in balance."

aquaponics,2s41na,0x0000ff,2,Mon Jan 12 16:13:34 2015 UTC,"No it wouldn't create problems. Ive seen it taken as far as full blown aquariams, with plants and all, piped to a grow bed. You can be as creative or, in my case, utilitarian as you'd like.  As far as smell, the ONLY time a fish tank, or aquaponics system in general, smells is when something is wrong and it's gone anaerobic.  I went to a local aquaponic/hydroponic store in my Austin, TX area and got 4 gallons of their water to help get my system cycled sooner. Had the water not been brown with fish poop floating around and if quality were measured by smell alone, that water smelled just like RO water."

aquaponics,2s48t1,In2082IwillBe100,1 point,Mon Jan 12 19:05:44 2015 UTC,"Sure.  I put $4000 in this system.  The largest costs are the high end containers.  you could do it with low cost containers but then you would be replacing them often or may have contamination.  I spent my $$ on food grade rated for 40 years bins and barrels to ensure the system will last a long time.  The rest of the money went to knowledge.  I hired a few people that knew about plumbing and the like to help me do the physical labor. I spent alot of time on Youtube learn different ways to do things.  The fish were only $1.50 each and the pump was less than $150.  I wanted to keep all the power needs under 100 watts.  So for the cost of running a light bulb all year I have my food.  As far as for water needs.  You recycle the same water over and over again.  So at first I put in a few thousand gallons in the system.  But that was just once.  let it sit for two days and then ran the pumps for two more days before starting to use.  I have city water and wanted to let most of the chemicals that treat it to evaporate.  Now I have 10 5 gallon buckets that I have on the side of the house.  We collect rain water and that is most of what I put in the system to replace evaporation.  (about 20 gallons every two weeks)  If we have a dry season them I fill them with city water and wait four days before using it.  So no increase in water bill.  I am a computer tech and used to have a $1200 a month light bill.  So to reduce the costs I added a K-var system and did spray foam insulation. I also added an energy saver pool pump for my pool and hot tub. At a cost of over $8000 I reduced my bill to $400 a month.  Then I added this Aquaponics system and I am averaging $430 a month. But there is so much variance from month to month I think the Aquaponics system makes little or no difference compared to my other power needs.  (40 computers, server closet, pool pumps, hot tub, and two air conditioners) I am looking into solar or wind power but so far it is not cost effective at this time to try to go off grid.  I am using a UPS which provided 45 min of power in case of an outage.  My concern is only the aerator so the fish can survive."
aquaponics,2s48t1,In2082IwillBe100,1 point,Tue Jan 13 04:14:29 2015 UTC,Really appreciate you taking time to detail and answer. When I was in Australia. A lot of people in the countryside would farm electricity through solar panels. Most would get a grant from the local government. The electric left over from house hold use was sold back to the grid. Which in most cases was enough to make mortgage payments.   Have you thought about DIY solar panels on instructable.com  Just to create a dent in the bill. Some cool easy to put together designs.

aquaponics,2s2vk7,arcrad,1 point,Sun Jan 11 20:29:27 2015 UTC,"It will work of course, as long as you have nutrients and water your plants should be okay - what you describe is basically no different to standard hydroponics. You will of course need to supplement the fish waste with other nutrients from time to time, but in principle it should work fine.    Can't you just use goldfish? seems a hassle to have to source fish poo separately."
aquaponics,2s2vk7,col381,1 point,Mon Jan 12 02:18:06 2015 UTC,"Is this concentrated waste from a filter backwash? Is the waste dewatered at all?  I would thaw a certain volume of it, then use water quality test to try to assess the nutrient content. (It might be worth doing for every batch.) If it is concentrated enough, it may be too high to register so it would need to be diluted with distilled water and remeasured.  - On the flip side, it may be under reporting the nutrient concentration since some of the organic forms (yet to be decomposed/mineralized) will not register.  This is essentially organic hydroponics, but using fish effluent instead of compost.  It may actually be better for fruiting crops as you will likely have a lower percentage of nitrogen in the solution. Since this is not just process water in an aquaculture system, you will not have as much ammonia (or nitrate) due to fish metabolism and urine. Instead it will just be the nutrient content of the poop and excess feed. This would have higher values of Phosphorus and Potassium relative to Nitrogen when compared to a typical aquaponics system."

aquaponics,2s2vk7,In2082IwillBe100,1 point,Mon Jan 12 19:02:43 2015 UTC,"Lots of aquaponics facilities choose to 'mineralize' solid waste that is removed from the solids filter.  Rather than dumping the solid waste, it is kept on-site in an isolated system in an attempt to break up the solids so they can be later reintroduced to the system to recapture the nutritional value for the plants.  All you do is have a separate barrel of water dedicated to this purpose.  Aerate it as much as possible.  Collect the solid waste from the system every day and put it in this isolated barrel.  When it comes time to add water back into the system, you just remove the aeration to allow the solids to settle (wait at least 30 minutes, more is better) and siphon off clear water from the top.    You could do something similar.  Maintain an isolated barrel of water in which you put the waste you acquire from the hatchery.  Aerate it a LOT.  Set up a schedule (once daily?  twice daily? experiment with it) to turn off the air, allow solids to settle, and siphon off clear nutritious water from the top.  Neat idea.  Good luck with it."

I am leaning toward the latter since gold fish poop a lot. add more growbed space or keep your stocking level lower."

In a fully cycled system, ammonia is converted to nitrites then nitrates very rapidly.  You can literally smell ammonia if that's your issue (the human nose can detect around 3.0 ppm of ammonia).     Do you have a test kit for ammonia and nitrate levels?    Are you literally running your water through a tank filled with worm poop?

Having a steady level is much more important than trying to shoot for some perfect value.    If your pH is enough out of whack that it's causing fish mortality, there is a bigger underlying issue.  In other words, the pH imbalance is a symptom, not a cause.  Fix the underlying issue and the pH issues will resolve, without having to use a pH adjusting additive."

I learned this trick by watching one of Murray Hallam's videos, and according to him the fish don't mind the MaxiCrop at all.  My fish didn't seem to care either, but you're at a place where you can add it without worrying about the fish just yet.  The murkiness of the water will take probably 3 days to clear up, but I'd bet that varies based on your grow medium.  I used hydroton/expanded clay and it took 3 days to clear up.

I do think that you need ensure dissolved oxygen is available to your fish - probably more than just what you get from water falling back to the tank.  Have you added any bubbler stones for the fish?"
aquaponics,2rk7xr,Whittigo,3,Wed Jan 7 17:18:56 2015 UTC,"I have not added any stones but do have a commercial sized air pump for my previous (nefarious) grow operations that have since stopped. Do you really think it'll be needed?   I'm planning on adding maybe 15-25 very small (<1"") goldfish and the siphon cycles every 8 minutes or so.    I am wide open to opinions or suggestions."
aquaponics,2rk7xr,In2082IwillBe100,2,Wed Jan 7 18:07:37 2015 UTC,"I think goldfish are super-tolerant of almost any water environment tanks can throw at them.  But to me, adding a bubbler will cost you about $10.  If that prevents a few dead fish, it will really pay off.  That dissolved oxygen helps the fish breathe.  Obviously when fish die, they start giving off ammonia very quickly and that can throw the pH balance of your water off fast and start hurting your plants.  The bubbler is a small air pump attached to air tubing attached to a stone.  This little pump will cost you $6, plus a few more for stones and tubing.  It could result in happier fish.  The alternative to adding it now is to wait and see how the fish do when they get dropped in.  If you see them surfacing the water and gulping in air, they definitely need more dissolved oxygen in their water."

I am not at all skilled making energy calculations but I think the one I linked to draws 1.5 w, and it runs 24x7.  So that would be 1.5w x 24 hours x 365 days = 13,140 w = 13.14 kW per year.  If you're paying $0.05 per kW hour, that would equal 13.14 x $0.05 = $0.66 per year.  That seems really low so double-check my math and your cost-per-kW-hour."

aquaponics,2rbfyy,Aquaponics-Heretic,5,Mon Jan 5 19:28:07 2015 UTC,The majority of backyard AP growers utilise media grow beds for both solids and bio-filtration.... quite successfully...  Employing DWC raft culture or NFT requires pre-filtering/removal of solids... and many backyarders employ swirl/vortex/radial flow filters for the purpose...  Many of the small scale farmers market hobby farm AP systems have also utilised media beds as the form of filtration prior to DWC rafts... (often promoted by Hallam and/or a series of devotees)  But media beds belong in the domain of the backyarder... they have no role in any serious commercial AP application...
aquaponics,2rbfyy,FrostyFish,2,Mon Jan 5 02:28:34 2015 UTC,"Because of sheer production of solids. Remember production of solids comes mostly from feed. In a backyard system, your stocking densities are small, meaning you feed little in relation to the size of the system. Commercial system will farm fish at densities up to 60 kilos per cubic meter of water and sometimes even more: that's a lot of solids right there. Your system will crash if 1) you don't size up the plant component properly and 2) if you don't use proper solids removal equipment."

But you can do the following too (though to what degree they'd be effective is uknown).  1) swirl/vortex filter 2) clarifier with filter pads (water enters at bottoms, rises through removable mechanical filter media, leaves through top) 3) bubble bead filter (water enters at top, splashes on floating biological filter beads, enters through bottom)  Depending on the amount of fish feed, you'd have to add more of each."

aquaponics,2rbfyy,Aquaponics-Heretic,1 point,Mon Jan 5 04:33:22 2015 UTC,"First thought: you'll need more trays. But let's see. And please check my maths.  A couple things to keep in mind:  -You'll need ~25 watts per square foot for good leafy growth and ~12w/sf for microgreens.  -So 20'x1' = 20sf --> 25w/sf * 20sf =500 watts total per tray of that size.  -As far as LED's go, it doesn't really matter what the marketed input wattage is, you'll need 100W coming out of the light. So make sure it's 100W of actual LED power and not a ""100W equivalent.""  NOTE: 4 fixture with 32w T8's would be optimal (~$250 at homedepot with bulbs).  -Now, everyone's diet is different. So let's say you're eating 4oz of greens per meal and 3 meals a day, you'll need  3/4lb of greens per day per person.     Or 22.5 lb per person per month.    -Again, depending on how good you are, you're yields will differ (given lighting wattage, it's height, your pH, micro and macronutrients). Aka feeding schedule and supplementation.  -So, let's assume you're getting .33lb per head of lettuce per 54 day cycle. But let's also say you're germinating these puppies in a tighter, separate space for 14 days before transferring them into your main tray and growing them out.  -Also, let's assume a semi-tight spacing of 3 plants per square foot (which will need ebb and flow or a fan). And some monitoring where the plants touch for mold (aka some 10% hydrogen peroxide in a spray bottle).  -So, 3 plants/sf * 20 sf = 60 plants/month -->60 plant/month * .33lb/plant/month = 20lb of edible lettuce weight.    Or, we can say, about 26 days worth of lettuce per day per each month.    SO, you'll need to at least double your grow space for 2 people, and probably triple it to provide space for germination and growout.      On fish, you'll need 1/2lb of fish per square foot of growout space. So Each tray will need 10lb of fish.    if you're on your fishit, you can get away with 1lb / 1 gallon of water.    so yes, a 50 gallon tank could provide enough nutrients for 1-3 trays.      NOTE! You'll need a working volume of water to run through the trays, and since it wont be in the fish tanks, you can't rely on it to provide your desired fish tank volume.  So, I'd reccomend a 100 or 150 gallon tank with tons of extra water, both to keep your 50lb of fish happier, and give you tons of extra water volume to move through you trays at any given time.

Or a way to deal with the harsh winters we have here in the northern part of West Virginia.    The only ideas that I managed to come by over the internet involves either: Electric heater. A set up that circulates heated water from the hot water tank through your system.    The last one involves a rocket stove mass heater that would do same as the water heater. Minus the gas consumption. Really just looking for a affordable way of heating the water.

Pumps move more water with less resistance/head and less water as resistance/head increases.  It's a curve.  If I had to guess, based only on your rough water volume and my own preference for a 2-3x fish tank turnover per hour, and the possibility for some future expansion, I'd probably go with a LifeTech 613.

aquaponics,2r84dw,hellbent64,1 point,Sat Jan 3 22:42:39 2015 UTC,"A fully cycled system should be 0ppm across the board.  The nitrates are being absorbed by the plants so that's expected to be 0.  0 Nitrites tells me that the nitrification bacterial colony has grown large enough that they're converting ammonia at a fairly decent speed.     Don't feed your fish tomorrow ( they won't starve to death that quick ) and then check the ammonia levels that evening.  If ammonia is at 0, adjust how much food you give your fish.  Most of the documentation I've read for feeding in aquaculture is to give enough feed until the fish are satiated, once per day.  It's possible your system is slightly overstocked if you're only feeding 1x a day.  Easiest way to deal with that is to reduce how much food you give your fish.  edit: For goldfish, I tell anyone who asks that they are dirty creatures ( which is great for AP ) but they're also diehard - http://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/jul/27/new-zealand-rescuers-goldfish  Edit #2: Forgot to ask.  What's raising your pH?  Specifically what are you adding to knock the pH level up?   And on a similar vein, have you done a KH ( karbonate hardness ) test?  KH slows down an AP systems natural drift down to acidity AND there are a few pH balancing compounds/chemicals that will absorb nitrites & nitrates."

It's not that people wouldn't like to have such a monitoring system, it's that they are costly due to the equipment involved.  If they were cheap enough, I think most backyard AP people would buy one, but I see no way it can be made cheaply enough.  Arduino or raspberry pi, while inexpensive for what they can do, still cost a decent amount.  Temperature probes are pretty cheap, but pH probes will cost a bit.  Dissolved oxygen probes cost a ton, and they have to be serviced (new membranes) or replaced pretty regularly.  Nitrogen probes are quite costly.  Most people will just opt to do their tests using an API kit and an old fashioned thermometer.  Also, there are quite a few commercial monitoring systems already available, and I think their price points are going to be competitive with anything else someone can slap together.  The difference though is that those systems are well proven, since they've been used in hydroponics, aquaculture and greenhouse systems for decades.

aquaponics,2r3q4c,LiquidDiary,8,Fri Jan 2 14:45:26 2015 UTC,"I have some recent experience with a micro aquaponics setup.  I was asked to discuss aquaponics at a community preparedness fair about 5 months ago, and I wanted to be able to show off a small-scale system to give people a visual explanation of aquaponics.    I used a 5-gallon water bottle, like you might find in the water cooler at your office.  I cut the top of the bottle off and turned it into a growing tray for my clay media.  The bottom of the bottle became the fish tank.  Here's an image from the blueprints I handed out.  The system was great to show off aquaponics, but I didn't love it afterwards.  So here's what I learned:   The old maxim used in aquaponics that says ""The more water in your system, the more stable it will be"" is absolutely correct.  My system had so little water in it that there was no buffer, and the whole system could be thrown out of balance very quickly.  My total system size was about 3.5 gallons. I had 2 koi-style goldfish in my micro system, and that was too much.  Those guys get big quickly. It took so long to get the nitrogen cycle right that I killed a lot of plants at first.  I was growing herbs like basil, lemon balm, mint and ornamental peppers.  I managed to kill all of of them within 2 weeks because there just wasn't enough food for the plants in that little system.  I could have gotten around this if I'd run the system for a few weeks with some liquid fertilizer (like Maxicrop/SeaSol) however it turns water black very quickly and I needed the system to show off at the fair, so I skipped that.  But my advice is to run it with a few drops of that without fish for a week before adding any plants.  You might need to cycle out a portion of that water before adding fish, too. I was clearly growing too many plants, but once again that was for show at the fair.  The plants were definitely nutrient-starved for a long time. I would say ""test your water"" to get the nitrogen balance right, but it is so volatile with that small amount of water that it didn't help me at all. The fish did great, despite all the trouble I had with the plants.  I decommissioned the system 2 weeks ago and moved the fish to a proper fish tank.  There was a period there where my pH levels got out of whack and I had to replace water in the system for fear of hurting the fish, but I probably could have left them in somewhat dirty water and they would have done fine.  I'm like you, though - I wanted the fish to be happy and healthy. I found that the traditional 15 minutes-per-hour flood/drain system was way too much water for my plants and grow media combination.  15 minutes per every 2 hours probably worked better for me.   What I would do differently if I did it again:   Stick to 1 goldfish or betta instead of 2. Use smaller grow media.  I used hydroton/expanded clay pebbles, but that was very big given how small the growing tray was.  In a system as small as the one you describe, I'd probably stick to plain old fish tank rocks.  The plant roots would be able to penetrate that just fine and it would look better in an ornamental system. Like you, I'd look for a plant that did better with shallow roots.  I think most herbs would work OK, but I would need to find something better than what I used (which was all for looks).  I don't think an inch of growing media will work for any plant - try at least 3. As mentioned before, I would run the system with a few drops of liquid fertilizer for a few days to establish the bacteria better before adding plants, and then run it for a few weeks before adding fish. I would consider buying a system rather than building one.  I can suggest a few places that do it better than I could, and when costs were all considered at the end of my project their systems would last longer and be prettier than anything I built myself.   I think you should consider trying to make a system no smaller than 4 gallons, for a few reasons.  First, balancing the system is near impossible with that little amount of water.  Just the amount you lose to evaporation will throw the system out of balance.  And Second, the fish needs a fair bit of water to swim.  When you flood and drain the system, you're removing a fair percentage of water from the fish tank, and you can't risk your fish's life each time by removing so much of that water.  Let me know if I can answer any other questions for you!"

If you have a properly stocked system with the appropriate amount of and species of worms and you are mindful of plants with large root systems or bag or pot your plants you can go almost indefinitely with out having to tear up yourbeds to much. Using a swirl filter or other prefilter before going to your beds can help alot as well and in my opinion is a great way to separate out those solid wastes so you can brew them into a nice compost tea and add back to your system later but I grow different plants then most others. Adding black worms and grindal worms helped my system alot towards eliminating the areas the red wigglers wouldn't go to.

You'll hear some people argue that theirs don't accumulate solids, and that the worms dispose of the solids, and I think they really believe that, but it's not really what really happens.  Worms will assist in further breaking solids down, but they don't magically make them disappear.  Unless you run with an extremely lightly stocked system, do yourself a favor and pre-filter your growbeds.  You'll be glad you did."
aquaponics,2r362k,Aquaponics-Heretic,4,Wed Jan 7 06:21:23 2015 UTC,"yes, and yes...  How long before your bed requires cleaning will depend on your feed/stocking rate... whether or not you employ solids removal... types of plants... and (undoubtedly controverserly)... the flood & drain methodology....  My experiments over the last 2 years running constant flood have led me to believe that unless solids removal is incorporated...  The media beds effectively becomes a settling tank... with the solids trapped,  and the water skimmed from the top of the bed.... and will become clogged rapidly compared to other F&D methods with the same feed/stocking rate...  Importantly... the corollary is that quick siphoned and timed slow drain methods.. result in a considerable return of suspended solids to the fish tank water....  Combining such a scenario with a CHOP2 design... is a disaster waiting to happen IMO.. unless very lightly stocked....  And this would seem borne out by the accumulation of solids in the sump tanks of such systems I've seen... again acting basically as a settling tank...  Such a pity the reddit doesn't allow easy attachment of photos..."

aquaponics,2r20nh,Aquaponics-Heretic,2,Fri Jan 2 09:26:31 2015 UTC,"I have seen this done to no apparent ill effect. In my test systems now I have moved two beds to 4""' of lava rock on bottom, and 4"" of hydroton. This helped with the initial floating of hydroton, But I am concerned about ill effects on my worms later on. I have other test beds using pure hydroton, and may test peagravel in a few as well. Hydroton is a major cost When used in any scale."
aquaponics,2r20nh,glennvtx,1 point,Fri Jan 2 20:27:44 2015 UTC,"I did exactly this. It's worked great for me. At first, I was thinking I'd just use the gravel on the bottom and the hydroton as the top 4 inches but stuff has gotten fairly well mixed up with time and hasn't shown any issues at all.  As for the pH, it entirely depends on the type of gravel you buy. Given that I live in PA I was worried the gravel I bought would contain a lot of limestone but not so. An easy test is to take a handful of gravel and pour a cup of vinegar over it--if it bubbles, it probably has some limestone or other high pH rock. If not, it's probably pretty neutral."

aquaponics,2r20nh,zynix,1 point,Fri Jan 2 02:59:32 2015 UTC,"I haven't used pea gravel, but the latest version of my media beds I have 3 layers of different material: 2"" of expanded glass, 8"" expanded clay, and the top 2 inches is reject expand clay ( to big, broken, or just weird ).  Different media provides different benefits or is better at different places in the bed.    The expanded glass is fragile but super porous so putting it at the bottom is likely better for providing a home for bacterial and far enough down to not receive the brunt of roots & waste accumulation.  With just gravel & expanded clay, in my opinion the gravel would be best as the bottom layer while the clay is near the top.  My reasoning is that the clay is a lot more fragile than gravel AND expanded clay is a lot better at wicking up water, so if your seeds are put down 1"" to 1.5"" down, they're more likely to germinate."
aquaponics,2r20nh,glennvtx,1 point,Fri Jan 2 04:06:25 2015 UTC,"That's kind of what i was thinking.

Have you had any mixing like squarerootofthree mentioned?"
aquaponics,2r20nh,ThisNerdyGuy,2,Fri Jan 2 05:01:30 2015 UTC,"Mixing will happen when it's time to clean the bed.  My plan for when that time comes around is a total cleanout ( everything comes out ).  I don't have enough experience yet to say when it's time to clean but I suspect its heavily dependant on what kind of plants are grown ( eg I just learned the Celery makes a HUGE root network ).  You can stall/delay the need to clean by putting some red worms into the bed about 2-3 months after its started.  As for the bacteria, the two primary strains N. Bacter & N. sonomas live intertwined with each other to the point where it's fairly difficult to separate them and they will colonize from the bottom to the top of the bed's wetzone.  Only exceptions is that they are extremely photophobic/light adverse so may not develop higher then 3"" below the bed surface."

I've held off building a hoophouse/greenhouse outside specifically because I could not solve this economically.  Bricks & concrete have been found to be able to hold more heat than water BUT only when energy is pumped into them - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_energy_storage#Heat_storage_in_hot_rocks.2C_concrete.2C_pebbles_etc  Unless you get into pressurized systems with molten salt, water is king for energy storage -  http://www.greenhousegarden.com/thermal-massheat-storage [ scroll down to the chart ]  As for how water plays out in heating a greenhouse - http://faq.gardenweb.com/faq/lists/strucs/2007011814009742.html  [ I like this article because it uses BTU's ]. *  If you have the time and energy, one idea I have seen involves building a rocket mass stove and adding a large storage tank to it -     RM heater wiki http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket_mass_heater Search for 2012-11-26 - http://www.iwilltry.org/b/build-a-rocket-stove-for-home-heating/   The bigger complaint I've heard from people trying to tie a RMS to heating a greenhouse is the need to constantly put wood into the stove through the night and managing overheating ( honestly just putting bees wax vent's would solve part of that ).  Tying a RMS to a large body of water could help solve that, especially in some sort dual loop set up ( a hot loop from stove heat's up a larger tank, distribution lines carry that heat out to radiant heaters ).  * If you have a ten 50 gallon drums, that's 400 lbs of water.  If you get the water up to ~120F in the evening and outside temperatures go below 32F, that's an 88 degree difference or roughly 35,000 BTU's of heat that can be radiated through the night ( hopefully not all in one short time span ).  To put that into perspective, my house requires ~100 therms a month to keep it @ 70F, or about 10,000,000 BTU's of energy a month for zone 5B ( low temps are -15 to -10 F ) which is roughly $80 a month.   My house is dual layered brick at ~1600 sqft so I have an R-value around 1.5 ( outer + air gap + inner ).  A hoop house might have an R-value of .02 to .5 depending on materials and how well its sealed."

aquaponics,2qszxm,Aquaponics-Heretic,1 point,Tue Dec 30 12:46:00 2014 UTC,"I was thinking if it more just cleansing the water in general because ammonia in the water tends to build up and I don't think that's really good for the fish you know? Like after all the water has run through the plants, there might still be left over ammonia, so that'd go into a purifying tank, along with the solids, and the duckweed will clean the water of ammonia while the solids sink to the bottom and gets trapped by a cloth filter so only clean water comes to the fish"
aquaponics,2qszxm,froschkonig,2,Tue Dec 30 20:12:40 2014 UTC,Don't think about it in terms of fish and plants. You're really creating an environment for beneficial bacteria. They will metabolize the ammonia into nitrites and then nitrates. Install more biofilters if you're worried about ammonia. The fish wont care if there's a lot of nitrates in the water (within reason) but the plants will love it and so will algae and or duckweed. You could create a cylone filter for the solids if there are a lot of them.
aquaponics,2qszxm,xippix,1 point,Wed Dec 31 02:19:40 2014 UTC,Plants dont process ammonia. It needs to be nitrates for the plants to pull it out of the water. A barrel filled with rocks or Bioballs will be better at converting the ammonia to nitrates than the duckweed will be.

aquaponics,2qszxm,dornforprez,2,Tue Dec 30 11:34:42 2014 UTC,"Hey there, I'm by no means an expert, but here's my two cents:   Yes, you can grow duckweed in the purifying tank, or wherever you have free surface area on the water.  That stuff grows fast, so whatever tank you put it in will likely fill up quick.  That said, I don't know if you'd want it in your purifying tank.  I'd say a better bet might be a sump tank or an extra DWC bed if you have one.  What are you using as a purifying tank?  Might want to think about a swirl filter to remove solid waste, but again that would not be the best place for duckweed.   You can absolutely put more than one tilapia in that much water.  20-25 is most likely okay, but be careful if you're concerned about stressing out your fish.  It might be wise to start with less fish or an extra tank to give them some more room.  Here's one resource I found on stocking density: ""Plan for one pound of fish for every 8-10 gallons of water. This ratio is for the established system, which means you will need to base your initial figure on the approximate weight of full-grown fish. The adjusted ratio of fingerlings to add to the system after cycling works out to 1/10 of a pound of fingerlings per 8-10 gallons of water. When your fish are fully grown out you will have one pound per 8-10 gallons at system maturity.""  http://brightagrotech.com/aquaponics-stocking-density/    I don't know if you want to carefully calculate like that, or if you like a little more trial and error.  In my opinion, I'd stick those 25 tilapia in there and just watch them to see how they do.  If it seems too crowded in the tank, move a couple to an auxiliary tank.   Yes, good idea.  If you know what you're doing with the sensors/regulators, the sky's the limit."

aquaponics,2qri55,herple_derpskin,0,Mon Jun 1 00:20:17 2015 UTC,"With one that small you likely will not see the growth in the pictures. A single betta will not produce enough waste and a well fed gold fish will outgrow that fairly rapidly. Lighting will be an issue unless there's a south-facing(or north if you're south of the equator) that gets hours of direct sunlight.   The above addresses the plant. As for the fish, bettas like water in the 75-80 degree range, and unless her plave of residence is very warm, the fish is likely to be stressed out and possibly killed if the water temp drops too much.   As an example, I have a 10gallon aquarium with 13 guppies in it (overstocked by any measure) and I still have to add extra nutrients to the water so my three basil plants do not die for lack of nitrogen.   Hope that answers your question."

aquaponics,2qpqre,TrapDaddy58,3,Tue Dec 30 05:18:29 2014 UTC,"I might push back on this a bit (the larger scale piece).  The small systems described in this guide don't scale well.  NFT tends to lose (or gain) heat too quickly in non-Hawaiian climates, and media beds fill up too quickly when you stock densely.  But it's great stuff for backyard."

aquaponics,2qp7va,FriedBizkit,1 point,Mon Dec 29 13:16:25 2014 UTC,"Lettuce isn't too high in protein, which is what you will want for your growing goldfish. Lettuce is a good supplement for their omnivorous diet."

aquaponics,2qp7va,FriedBizkit,1 point,Tue Dec 30 21:53:32 2014 UTC,Ah I sorta thought so but the question was what fish and what do you feed them. Haha  I don't think you have to grow high protein crops. The proteins are used up and excreted as basic compounds which bacteria convert to nitrogen

Backyard sets on temperate areas may use carp. Or tilapia for the summer and carp for the winter.   If you are able to keep the temperatures, tilapia is usually the choice.   Catfish is also awesome. They are hungry, resistant and outright delicious  You can buy fish feed but you could also feed tilapia and catfish with some food scraps taking care that they eat everything."

aquaponics,2qp7va,sopimusician,2,Fri Jan 2 00:47:37 2015 UTC,I'm just planning to cycle my indoor system soon but plan to use rosy red minnows. They can be quite hardy like goldfish but don't grow to the large sizes. I find more appeal in having schools of fish. I also see the appeal of only losing a small fraction of my nitrate productions with a fish death.
aquaponics,2qp7va,MilkCurds,2,Tue Dec 30 21:42:13 2014 UTC,"Depends largely on size and climate of course. If you are going to have a couple hundred gallons and want to eventually eat your fish, you go for a Tilapia in warmer climates, colder fish in colder climates. I'm not familiar with the colder fishes so I'll let someone else talk about that. If you are going small and wont have the size to grow out some good eating fish goldfish are usually the go-to fish. But any aquarium fish can be used.  Feed should be a good high quality feed. Once you determine what fish you are using then research what the best food you can get for them is. Remember whatever you put into your fish is what eventually goes into your plants as well. So a better feed will mean better nutrients for your plants. Of course that's a very high level view, you will probably need to supplement with a few micro nutrients, but its a starting viewpoint."

aquaponics,2qow7h,DeepDislikeOfCars,5,Mon Dec 29 06:53:27 2014 UTC,"Doubling the biomass might have crashed your dissolved oxygen if you weren't aerating enough.   A bacterial outbreak might also be a cause, but the mortality pattern doesnt fit too much. Very few bacterial strains kill that fast. Did you see any disease progression? (Lethargy, erratic swimming, folded fins). If you didn't and they just died within a day or two, something wrong happened with water quality. If your ammonia and nitrite were okay (and I would suspect on that kit because you almost NEVER have zero nitrate) and pH was OK, then didsolved oxygen was the next parameter.   Bacteria will always be there no matter what. You can do several things.  1) Isolate the fish tank, drain it. Bleach it, scrubbing surfaces. Rinse. Let dry. Fill up.   2) Or, take plants out and run the whole system on bleach or hydrogen peroxide. The latter is better. Much better results if you submerge your hydroton in bleach for a day or two. Then rinse the system and start over. You will kill your biofilter tho.   Whatever you do. Don't leave dead fish in: they will harbor more pathogens. If you want to keep your plants fed, use a nutritive solution or just throw fish feed in the water.   I would start with option 1) first. Clean and rinse fish tank and stock it again. Don't overstock!"
aquaponics,2qow7h,Pastelitomaracucho,3,Mon Dec 29 07:56:04 2014 UTC,"So sorry about the fish problems.   I'm surprised to see the nitrites and nitrates were both at zero for a system running for that long and with plants thriving. Are you sure you were performing the water tests correctly according to the instructions? The nitrate one, in particular, is really specific in the multiple steps so I recommend double-checking that. I speak from personal experience as I was screwing up the tests... thought my nitrates were at zero but were actually around 100 after I read the instructions :-).  I'm afraid I don't have any specific suggestions for the next steps but best of luck."
aquaponics,2qow7h,Trailmagic,3,Mon Dec 29 13:41:51 2014 UTC,You also gotta smack the bottles pretty hard to get the crystals suspended in the solution prior to using the nitrate bottle (forget if its #1 or #2). Otherwise it will give lower results than it should.
aquaponics,2qow7h,CloudHead,3,Mon Dec 29 18:23:13 2014 UTC,"""System outdoors in Australian summer"" - Waters ability to hold oxygen is substantially reduced with increased temperature. Cold water has more oxygen than warm water. Your fish may have died from oxygen deprivation--did you see them gasping? In the future, try to go slower than double fish in one day.. before pulling your whole system try putting a few feeder fish in again and see how they do."
aquaponics,2qow7h,zynix,2,Mon Dec 29 16:25:15 2014 UTC,"/user/CloudHead's advice here seems fairly reasonable http://www.reddit.com/r/aquaponics/comments/2qow7h/fish_all_died_how_do_i_proceed/cn8dok8  Adding on to it, feed 1/4 your AP system about half the fish feed you gave the goldfish and if you find it, ammonium chloride is a pretty cheap source of ammonia.  Those two will turn your system into a really bad hydroponic system and give yourself a chance to make changes/fixes, then introduce slightly more goldfish."

Also, the disease and parasites that thrive in chicken poop can easily kill not only the fish, but the plants.  So...idk.

Green water that will clog your system eventually. Algae that will compete with your plants.   But you know what? Why the fuck not? Read about pond farming and mesocosms so you know what to expect. Produce a mesocosm system and use to produce filter feeders or better: to produce fingerlings of sensitive species.   This system will not give you plants: algae will take over unless you are very careful with how much chickens and feed you put in.  And finally, you are going against the axiom of recirculating aquaculture: remove the solids from the system asap. You are adding solids. Protip: you may use a buffer tank where you strore chicken manure and water to create a nutritive solution, then dose it to your system under control  Water quality will spike horribly unless you are carefully with your N mass balance."

aquaponics,2qblg1,sopimusician,2,Wed Dec 24 23:42:26 2014 UTC,"You don't have to worry about overflowing the aquarium.  Once your grow bed is full of medium and your aquarium is still empty, fill the grow bed with water until the siphon kicks in and drains.  Once the grow bed is empty, measure how many inches of water was added to the aquarium.  This number is how much the aquarium will lower every time the grow bed fills up.      My guess is that a 40 gallon grow bed full of medium will hold ~10 gallons of water.   If you have the standard 50 gallon aquarium of 19 inches high, 10 gallons of water from the grow bed will make the aquarium fluctuate ~4 inches - or 1/5th of the height.  This is a measurement with the estimate that your grow bed holds 10 gallons of water. your results may vary.  50 gal/19 inch=2.631 gal per inch  10 gal/2.631 gal per inch= 3.8 inches or water (rounded up to 4)  For this next part I will assume you have a pump that requires at least 4 inches of water to stay operable.  With the 4 inches of fluctuation from the grow bed plus the 4 inches needed for the pump, you would have 11 inches of space to play with.  11 inches equals 30 gallons of water that you can loose before absolutely needing to top of with new water before your pump stops working.  I live in Arizona which is very dry and I loose about 1 gallon of water a week in my 20 gal system.    You don't need to worry about back pressure or too much pressure from the water level changing.    Fish wont get over crowded from the water fluctuating a few inches.      Good luck with the build!"

aquaponics,2qblg1,Whittigo,1 point,Mon Jan 5 00:52:56 2015 UTC,"Use of a sump can solve your big problem of water level in the fish tank. Have a stand pipe draining into the sump so the fish tank is always at a set level and have the pump in the sump tank. That way you can utilize either a flood and drain or a continuous flood system.  Now 55 gallons of water to a 40 gallon grow bed seems small. This of course depends on how your system is set up. If you have a shallow and long grow bed leaving plenty of room for growing greens or other things that don't need a huge depth for roots might work. Just a couple of standard 10-12"" grow beds wont provide much room for plants to use up nitrates.  If you are stocking your fish to high capacity you need more grow space. The ""common"" ratio is 2:1 grow space to fish tank. There is much more of course to it, stocking densities, feeding regularity. But if you have 2:1 grow to tank you usually don't have to worry about it as long as your not overstocked and over feeding."

And yeah, i'm planning a foot deep bed with bok choy, water cress, and other nitrogen intensive plants, with a small number of fish that will increase as my output increases. I'm new to this, so i'm hoping i'll be able to feel out the balance once it gets running, but my primary goal at the moment is to get the eb-flow running smoothly first.     If i grew more diverse plants like nightshades and herbs, would that allow me to run it deeper and get more gallons going?"

For you first system, grow bed over fish tank ( water goes from FT to GB back to FT ) is fine.  It's when you start going above 100 gallons that you will get a lot of sedimentation/waste issues ( both from fish poop as well as from your media giving off dust/particles over time )."
aquaponics,2qblg1,dirt_ed,1 point,Thu Dec 25 23:31:26 2014 UTC,"Do you have an photos, or even schematics, showing your setup? It sounds like you have a basic system, grow bed on top, tank below. The water wil be pumped in the top, then flow out a drain in the bottom. Am I right?  Basically, all you need is for the water flowing in and the water flowing out to be at the same rate...unless you are doing a siphon drain, but I will get to that in a minute. If the pump is too powerful, it will get ahead of the drain and you will overflow. If that happens, you need a less powerful pump or a larger drain.   If you are using a siphon on the grow bed, just make sure that the amount of water the grow bed holds before draining doesn't require you to empty your tank. With a larger tank than your grow bed, it shouldn't be a problem, again, unless your drain can't keep up with the pump, which is more likely with a siphon.   Not sure what you mean about the back-pressure. The pump will be pumping up from the tank into the grow bed, where it will exit into the air. There shouldn't be any real changes in pressure other than if you hit a point where the water level drops far enough in the tank that the pump can't pump any higher. For most submersible pumps, it will just spin at that point and not do any real damage. If the pump runs dry, though, it might burn itself out."
aquaponics,2qblg1,dirt_ed,1 point,Thu Dec 25 03:37:03 2014 UTC,"Here's a rough idea of what i'm planning. And i'm planning on having a bell siphon draining straight out of the bottom into the tank.    So, even if the tank gets down to say, thirty gallons, the pump won't experience any change in input pressure? Will that be too low in the 55 gallon tank for the fish, if it gets to like 60% capacity? I'm planning on having a small number of smaller breed tilapia, so they'll already be crowded. And i'm not sure how much the grow bed will truly require with the expanded clay in there.    But basically, you're saying as long as the siphon drainage rate, and the pump rate balance out, then i shouldn't run into any major problems, besides the siphon start and stop?"
aquaponics,2qblg1,dirt_ed,1 point,Thu Dec 25 05:01:37 2014 UTC,"Every pump has what is known as a pump curve. A lot of the ones for aquariums and such don't include it, but they all still have one. In essence, the pump curve is a graph of flow rate to elevation change. The elevation change is the difference between the water surface elevation at input (your sump tank) to the output of the pump. As your water level drops that elevation change increases, making the pump work harder and slowing the input of water. This doesn't hurt the pump, but it will help your system find its equilibrium of water in:water out.  As for the fish getting crowded, I agree with what metalfish said. The drop in water won't be much, so it shouldn't be a problem. But tilapia don't fuss much about overcrowding, so that shouldn't be a problem. Honestly, if you have even a little problem with overcrowding, you are going to have a bigger problem with the system processing the nitrogen quickly enough."
aquaponics,2qaaxe,dputers,5,Wed Dec 24 16:06:25 2014 UTC,"Duckweed is an excellent supplemental feed for tilapia. They love it! If you are worried about pests, You can get a starter culture from your friend and grow it in the sump tank or a tank next to your fish tank. It grows pretty fast..."
aquaponics,2qaaxe,surfunky,2,Wed Dec 24 17:47:48 2014 UTC,"Good idea. Pests are definitely an issue, but starting with a tiny culture and growing it on the side is a good way to minimize that problem. Also rinse it well to detach parasites. If you just take bags and bags of duckweed from the wild and feed it, the chance of cercariae(parasites you can't see) or snails or some other ugliness riding along with it is pretty high."

aquaponics,2q9znl,f5_lurkmoar_f5,3,Wed Dec 24 13:47:18 2014 UTC,"Hi f5_lurkmoar_f5,   This is a great question and I am really happy you are thinking about the longevity of the fish!  I have a decent amount of experience with Aquaponics, but I have only ever used feeder fish to start my cycling, never goldfish.  I would have to say my concern with only one fish, would be that you might not be creating enough waste to create a good equilibrium for your plants.  The good thing is, even with very little input of fertilizer your plants will still grow and might even flower.  The issue you will find is that you will not be producing as robust plants as you could be.  There are a lot of trade offs when it comes to Aquaponics, or really all food production, you just have to determine what you end goal is.  This all said, I am not an expert with goldfish, so one might be enough, but my gut says no.  Also you can think about supplementing with different types of aquatic life.  I have read a lot about crawfish and how they make great additions to aquaponic setups.  The good thing is they are small, and I think you might be able to add them into your tank with the goldfish.  This should give you a bit of a boost but not to much of an issue with space.  I am sorry I could not be to much more help with this, but it seems like you are on the right track.  I am sure there is more you can read about goldfish, but in the end experimenting with your setup is the only way to know for sure.  Thanks and Merry Jesus Day! Grebnesor-ous-rex :)"
aquaponics,2q9znl,finnerpeace,2,Wed Dec 24 15:27:08 2014 UTC,"I've also read somewhere that they're fairly social and might do better with company, so that could be another reason go with two. Also I'd be getting a basic ""fancy"" type because they're slower and need less space.  I'll look into crawfish too... hadn't thought of that. Thanks for the input."
aquaponics,2q9znl,zynix,3,Wed Dec 24 15:52:43 2014 UTC,"I keep goldies as well as other fish myself: I'd totally find another species, actually, unless if you're actually keen on the idea of having goldies for pets. There's nothing magical about goldfish, and they have all the disadvantages you stated.   One reason goldies are recommended is because of their hardiness in unheated cooler tanks. What are your expected temps? Once you know that, you can work with it and find species. There are some really cool ones: I'm partial to pumpkinseeds (and those are good eating once they're larger); crayfish also sounds like a good idea.  However, I think if you do like goldies and would like to keep them, trying 2-3 of the smaller types (oranda etc) might be fine with all the extra filtration from your plant beds. As long as you have a back-up plan for if it's not working out. They tend to be less hardy though, so it's a bit of a toss up how well they'll do.  I think added crayfish would torture goldies, along with any other fish. I'd do the crayfish alone, or with fish that you don't mind them catching and eating/ripping fins on..."
aquaponics,2q9znl,zynix,1 point,Wed Dec 24 18:10:59 2014 UTC,"Yeah, I'm not particularly set on goldfish, but from what I read, they seemed to be pretty low maintenance/cheap/most tolerant of mistakes, even with the waste/space factor.  The room temp might naturally range from 64-86F, but I could use a heater to widen my option of species. At this point, I'm mostly interested in low-maintenance and cheap over anything else."
aquaponics,2q9znl,JJGBM,2,Thu Dec 25 17:14:40 2014 UTC,"I assume that's largely due to their high waste output; waste is much less desirable in an aquarium than in an aquaponic growbed.    Goldfish don't have a stomach so food goes in, races through their intestines and out.  You can mitigate this by feeding them less ( fish don't really need/expend that much energy ).    goldfish's natural longevity and potential size (similar to koi) if kept properly.    In super ideal circumstances, there have been photographic evidence of goldfish growing to 2' ( feet ) long, unsure of how heavy but they get big.  http://www.fs.usda.gov/detail/ltbmu/home/?cid=STELPRDB5411669   Apparently keeping them in a confined area greatly reduces their lifespan because their body stops growing but their internal organs don't, and these crush against each other, etc.   Some fish never really stop growing, goldfish are in this category.  They will/do grow beyond the capacity of their homes and the only reason their growth slows down is because they start being poisoned/stunted by their own waste.   How many goldfish can/should I keep in 25 gallons,   http://imgur.com/TsyHgMX.png  I have 3, they're 2-3"" long and kept in a ""tank"" that is run with high velocity flows ( nothing can settle to the bottom and if it does, it won't stay there ).  Keep in mind this is a relatively mature system ( 13-14 months ) so there's a fairly extensive biofilter + red worms, and I've got the amount of feed I give the fish down to a science.   with their good health and longevity in mind, and still reasonably grow some plants?    From the picture above, the only limit is spacing for light.   I was going to start with a single small one, but am not sure how much plant life it would support.   Give it a try with a few seeds, keeping attention for nutrient deficiencies ( http://aquapons.info/resource/recognize-plant-nutrient-deficiencies/  and or http://www.hydroponicsequipment.co/solutions-for-nutrient-deficiency/ ).  A healthy mindset is to accept that things can and will get kind of wonky, just try to learn from the mistakes.  Note:  The pictured system is mostly left alone which is why the surface looks like frosted coco-pebbles due to calcification and other minerals building up on the surface.  LECA (light expanded clay aggregate ) aka ""Hydroton"" is fairly porous and seems to naturally wick up excess minerals into the dry zone of a media bed.  For me I kind of expect for that to show up as I have Rocky Mountain snow melt water treated with chloramine coming out of the taps ( so a little bit of everything is in each & every drop )."
aquaponics,2q9znl,JJGBM,1 point,Wed Dec 24 20:37:03 2014 UTC,"I'm also using hydroton and plan to add worms. As far as plants, I'll probably start with something like basil. I guess I could even start with one fish and add the second as I get more plants."

aquaponics,2q6gnw,DJTBALL,6,Tue Dec 23 15:06:59 2014 UTC,I'm going to guess you need more filter. Your pump is probably chewing up all your fish poo into finer and finer solids as it recirculates in your system. Poo soup!
aquaponics,2q6gnw,EternalNoob,7,Tue Dec 23 16:04:43 2014 UTC,"I dont have anything concrete in mind, but it could be because of your inadequate grow bed/fishtank ratio (1:1 being the standard and in some cases 1:2, you have ca. 1:4). There may not be enough plants filtering the output of your fish tank enough, and so it may build up over time causing the water to be murky. It all depends on the amount of fish you have in a specific volume (fish density) and the amount of plants you have to filter the incoming water. Of course if you have extra filters setup, and if they are working then I dont think its the cause. Your ph seems a little high, the temperature too, maybe thats causing something (dont know about this though)."

But the filter helped with that a lot.   Also, any ideas on lowering water temp? Low on budget right now so can't go out and buy a new pump."
aquaponics,2q6gnw,zynix,1 point,Tue Dec 23 19:19:14 2014 UTC,"Yea the water temp can be a problem.  There are a couple good solutions I saw, like recycling an old refrigerator, and using the coils to cool your tank, but this is pretty hard to do unless you are really an engineering type.  This idea is just spit balling, I honestly dont know all the negatives.  But you might consider getting longer tubes/pipes that come back from draining from your plant bed, then have it go out a window, coil some tubing out side, then bring it back in.  I dont know how much higher your plant bed is, or if you are close to a good window to do this with, but since its winter, you could use the outside temp as your regulator.  Like I said, I am sure there are some negatives, but I really just dont know what they are."

aquaponics,2pzovn,Herbalvore,1 point,Mon Dec 22 14:00:40 2014 UTC,isnt that a lot of algae?
aquaponics,2pzovn,redditkindasucksnow,2,Sun Dec 21 22:58:26 2014 UTC,"It does seem to be a lot, but the flipside is that there might be an imbalance between plants and fish, and the algae are just keeping the system in balance.  Just from the cursory look at the growbeds in the video, it looks like there are only 3 pots of young plants and a whole 275 gal IBC, so the fish are probably producing more nitrogen than the plants can use. If you go the painting route like u/froschkonig said, you can just introduce more plants to your system and get things in balance.  It's really not a bad problem to have--algae is healthy for a system. There is research that indicates algae can be beneficial for plant growth, as high levels of phytohormones are produced in algae: ""Phytohormones in algae"" E. R. Tarakhovskaya, Yu. I. Maslov, M. F. Shishova"
aquaponics,2pzovn,hazardousplay,2,Mon Dec 22 00:39:06 2014 UTC,"Any benefits from "" high levels of phytohormones""... would be totally out-weighed by the detrimental swings in both pH and DO....  Algae in an AP system doesn't imply you have a ""healthy"" system... it implies (as you suggest).. that it's an unbalanced system...  Unbalanced systems have a habit of... falling over... :D  The system itself though, and the water quality... actually aren't that bad at all...  I think people might be viewing the bio-film buildup on the tank surfaces as algae... it's not..."
aquaponics,2pzovn,Aquaponics-Heretic,2,Mon Dec 22 08:37:38 2014 UTC,algae does not necessarily mean your pH is high or your DO is low.  It simply means you'll need to take measures to balance what the algae is doing to your system.
aquaponics,2pzovn,tewls,2,Mon Dec 22 11:29:38 2014 UTC,"Algae means that your pH and DO will swing diurnally  The easiest, and really the only way to ""balance"" or control algal issues... is to avoid them in the first place...  There is absolutely no benefit to be had in having algae in an AP system.. and several potentially disasterous consequences in allowing it to exist"
aquaponics,2pzovn,Aquaponics-Heretic,2,Mon Dec 22 11:41:07 2014 UTC,"pH swings may stunt your bacterial growth, but if you have algae your bacteria are already established, likely.  Everything else will be relatively unaffected, provided you over saturate DO and don't expose algae to direct sunlight.  Algae only swing pH by consuming CO2.  They only consume CO2 during the day to meet photosynthetic demands.  Keep them out of the sun and the swing will be mild.  In some circumstances your plants may actually absorb MORE nutrients if you can hit a nice pH average where you have something like 7-7.2 pH during the say and 6.8 at night.  Fish and plants are highly pH swing resilient so long as we're talking swings within safe ranges.  Consider how often people do 80% water changes in their aquarium and remember that those fish will see easily a 1 pH change in the matter of 10 minutes and they do just fine.  I'm sure that drastic will cause stress, but algae will not cause that kind of swing.  I'm open to data suggesting otherwise, but with what I've read it would seem algae in moderation can at worst slow the system down and at best speed it up significantly."
aquaponics,2pzovn,tewls,1 point,Mon Dec 22 12:24:44 2014 UTC,"Looking at it from a natural perspective, unbalanced systems work to correct themselves, one way or another. That's fine in an open system like you'd have in nature, but with a closed system like in an AP setup, it might kill your fish or your plants and ruin your setup. So excess algae is just the system dealing with excess nitrate. I still maintain peb7024 needs more plants in his setup, but algae in moderation are definitely part of a healthy and stable system.  I didn't think about the sun-moderated swing in pH, but if what tewls says is right, then it shouldn't be a big deal. In lakes, pH changes of that range are routine just by depths of a few meters, DO and temperature even more so.  I will concede that excess algae can be a big problem at first, but I'm very very much against the school of thought that aqupaonics should be a sterile, tightly controlled affair. (At risk of sounding like a hippie) growing/cultivating is much easier if you use the power of nature instead of fighting against it."

aquaponics,2pwaza,ccgeogeek,3,Sun Dec 21 18:07:52 2014 UTC,"You want to avoid limestone-containing materials in your media mix, as they will buffer your pH above the range that most plants tend to prefer, and lock out nutrients from being absorbed by your plants.  To determine if you have limestone-containing material, perform a vinegar test.  Take a representative sample of the material and place in a tall glass with household vinegar (5% canning vinegar works just fine).  You should see a small amount large bubbles for a little while as trapped air escapes from the media, but if you see active bubbling or fizzing of small bubbles (like champagne), you have limestone in your media.

I'd check out these links to have a start:  -http://friendlyaquaponics.com/docs/HowManyPrawnsCanISqueezeIn.pdf and http://www.aquacultureoftexas.com/aquaponics.htm (this one is probably the most comprehensive site out there re: prawn cultivation)  Your biggest problem might be the cost of getting the prawns, as well as the problem of minimum orders (what does one do with the extra thousands of juvenile prawns??).

I'm in the south-east of England, and I've found media such as expanded clay is too expensive in the volumes that I need.  I have allot of soil and well rotted horse manure (4-5 years) from the stables that is free.   Construction of the future beds will be much lower cost. The first three beds will be converted from the shingle media flood-drain beds that I built a few years ago. The main beds in the polytunnel will be constructed from sandbags filed with back-fill from the sump hole. These will be 1m wide and about 20m in length.  The second thing that I like about the grow-bags is the ease with which things can be re-arranged and moved around. With smaller plants, I can use the smaller bags. As the plants grow, they can be spread out. I can also move plants outside into larger beds in the spring if need be.  Over the course of next year I'm going to be expanding the system to fill my polytunnel (5x25m) and also my out-door garden (similar size)."

aquaponics,2pi0op,blackjackel,5,Tue Dec 16 19:57:31 2014 UTC,Best way to treat them is daily salt dips( 1.25lbs of aquarium salt per 5 gallons of water. net your fish and place him in the salt water for 60 - 90 seconds. then return him to the fresh water). This will kill all ich on the fish and when the free swimming larva attach to the fish you can kill them again with the dip the next day. Do this for a week or 2. You can also turn up your heater by 8 - 10 degrees as well. This speeds up there metabolism until they die before laying eggs again. This also helps. You can also use a UV sterilizer but be careful not to run it longer than you have ich in the system. UV sterilizers effect your available IRON and can dramatically reduce your boron and zinc. This is why they should only be used as a last resort.

aquaponics,2pi0op,zynix,3,Wed Dec 17 19:55:41 2014 UTC,"I've not dealt with ich, have had to work with fish lice.  If you have some ammonium chloride and don't want to lose your fish, pull them into a quarantine tank, give them anti-ich meds, and then turn your AP system into a horrible hydroponic system ( 100-500mg* of ammonium chloride, fish food 1x a day, and normal additive as needed for your plants. )  Part of ich's life cycle depends on having a host, if you raise the tank temp and don't provide fish, they will die out from a high metabolism and nothing to breed/feed off of.  How long will that will take? For lice it was 45 days + very high water turbulence flushing everything into the grow bed.  For ich, I would recommend googling and seeing what people say then adding 15% on top just to be safe but I can't see them surviving longer then 2 months.  As for adding sodium, yes you can do water changes but once the salt builds up in the media bed it will become harder to flush but stunt your plants ( I tried this and that's what happened to me ).  edit: * dosage is heavily dependant on plant nitrate needs, start in small doses and see how long ammonia & nitrites hang around then adjust as needed."
aquaponics,2pi0op,Pastelitomaracucho,1 point,Tue Dec 16 20:05:47 2014 UTC,"No need to use chemicals. What you need to do is to break the life cycle of the parasite. Take your infected fish into a treatment aquaria. Raise the temperature to 30 degrees Celsius slowly. Acclimate them to that. Once or twice a day, take the fish out. Empty the aquaria! Rinse it, fill it up and put the fish back in. Having more than one fish tank for treatment makes life easier.   Do this for 7 days.   Like this, you will be flushing out the settled, reproducing cysts and the free living form of ich as they exist out of the skin of the fish. Constant flushing will stop them from reaching your fish again.   After this, some lessons:  1) quarantine your fish before you put them in your system  2) keep water quality in check. Ich attacks easily when fish are immunosupressed."

It fills/drains probably every 20 minutes. There's also a drain hose on the left side of the bed. The pond is, I don't know, maybe 600 gallons.  The plants are in Root Pouches between 1 and 7 gallons and just sit on the rock maybe an inch above the water level, not actually touching the water. The plants haven't gotten any top watering since they went on the bed, save for the rain. Most plants are started from seed, the others were in 4"" pots.   There's only 4 medium koi in the pond right now. I had a problem with high PH in the beginning until an accidental 50% water change.

aquaponics,2pe020,Trailmagic,1 point,Mon Dec 15 22:50:22 2014 UTC,but what about the nitrogen?
aquaponics,2pe020,Sycosys,0,Mon Dec 15 20:47:49 2014 UTC,Nitrogen is already in your system (Nitrates).. a tiny dash more wont make any difference.. Literally you add iron chelate to AP systems at a rate of about a teaspoon per 50 gallons.
aquaponics,2pe020,Trailmagic,1 point,Mon Dec 15 20:52:21 2014 UTC,"I have experience with planted tanks but not aquaponics, so forgive my ignorance on the topic. Can you really make such a broad statement about nitrogen? In what form does it usually enter the system? Ammonia/ammonium? Nitrite? Nitrates? If it's anything but nitrates, how are large doses rendered safe by the system before affecting the fish? Is it solely via aerobic bacteria or do the large number of plants play a role?"
aquaponics,2pe020,Sycosys,0,Mon Dec 15 20:53:43 2014 UTC,"it's a matter of scale. You aren't dumping the entire container in the AP system, you are adding a few parts per million.  Plants need just the tiniest bit of iron to be healthy, and any other elements/ micronutrients are going to be added in even smaller quantities.   Nitrogen in AP come from the nitrogen cycle (as with an aquarium) Ammonia -> nitrite -> Nitrate  Adding a little N in your iron chelate wont drive up your nitrates noticeably since most ap systems are already rocking 40-120ppm nitrate levels.   This is especially true since you add Iron once every few months"
aquaponics,2pe020,Trailmagic,1 point,Mon Dec 15 21:11:05 2014 UTC,"Word thanks, that makes a lot of sense. I do low tech walsted/soil-based tanks with low productivity (makes them easy) and am flabbergasted by your nitrate levels, although they make sense in the context of a balanced high-output system. I was mostly curious if your N starts as ammonia like in my tank, which you indicated to be the case."
aquaponics,2pe020,Sycosys,0,Mon Dec 15 21:21:09 2014 UTC,I manage my nitrates by varying the temperature of the water to increase/decrease the input of food/waste.   Cold Water (68 degrees) = less food for the fish  = less nitrates (great for flowering/fruiting phases)  Warm water (80 degrees) = more food for the fish = more nitrates (great for vegetative growth)

aquaponics,2pd5u4,thegingerkid13,2,Mon Dec 15 15:26:45 2014 UTC,"Hi Friend,  I like the design, its pretty simple, my only complaint would be that plastic bins do warp with a lot of weight, so be careful.    That is a small space for fish, so you might have a hard time growing edible fish, although some might disagree with me.  I usually start cycling on a new system with goldfish.  They are cheap, and they do a good job of creating the bacteria you need.  The only downside is they are not edible, and I have always had a couple that live through initial cycling and then I have to ask myself if I kill them or leave them.  I have heard of people using craw fish, which would work well with this size of a system.     I think that another issue with your plan is to use it inside, unless you have a good source of light, like HPS, Metal Halide, LEDs, or dedicated florescent lights, you will not be able to do this.  Also if you are going to use these lights, I would suggest doing a bit bigger of a system, so you can maximize the lights you are using.  If you have about $150 - $200 to drop on lights I would suggest an UFO LED light, with a wide spectrum.  They work great, and use very little electricity.     As for maintenance the thing I like about aquaponics is most of the work is at the onset, creating your system and cycling so you have a good eco-system.  There are minor tweeks you will want to make a long the way, but once you are up and running your biggest time suck will be removing plants and replanting, which is not very hard.  I am pretty notorious for changing my reddit name, but if you have any questions please let me know.  I have build several aquaponics systems and have a very green thumb.  Peace,  Grebnesor  Edit:  Looked at his drain and its just lazy!  You should make a bell siphon, its easy and cheap, but it actually drains all of the water from the plant bed so they are not constantly sitting in the same water.  His drain is really just taking the new water being pumped in and draining it out, but leaving most of the old water at the bottom of the container.... Lazy."
aquaponics,2pd5u4,zynix,2,Mon Dec 15 20:28:06 2014 UTC,"first   Sounds perfect to me, my first AP system was built after this - http://www.japan-aquaponics.com/micro-aquaponics-plans.html  Two things I could see improved with your linked design:   Use a bell syphon - http://www.japan-aquaponics.com/bell-siphon-guide.html Use rigid PVC piping, you don't need to glue it and its a lot more stable.    What kind of fish could I use in something like this?    Goldfish, 2-4 is plenty as they're dirty little creatures.   How much maintenance would it take, and what would I need to do to maintain it?   For the first month or so I checked everyday, everything the API freshwater kit has to offer - http://www.apifishcare.com/product.php?id=580 ( $21-32 depending on how hard you look, prices vary ).  Now I check my system every 2 weeks, add some carbonates, a few minerals ( potassium, phosphate, iron ).  Every few months its good to flush the bottom of the tank as waste ( fish food, fish poop, stuff ) accumulates.  For my micro I've got a water pump blower that I throw in ( it's likely not good for the fish but meh ) that eventually gets sucked up into the bed.  Maybe every 6-12 months you may need to wash your media ( I haven't and mine looks like frosted coco puffs due to mineral accumulation you cannot delay that, depending on water source, ).  You can avoid gunk/debris build up in the media bed by putting red wiggler worms into the bed after 2-3 months ( they need waste to eat ).  They will break down excess waste and dead roots.   I would like to use this inside.   Set it up against a south facing window that gets sunlight and you're golden ( only thing that has failed in my micro was cucumbers ).  And on that note, a general outline of additives for AP can be found here  - http://www.reddit.com/r/aquaponics/wiki/additives.

I did some retrofitting to my cheap little hoop house in order to make it a milder climate and i hope i get two years out of it. After learning a bunch about the whole notion of having a greenhouse I am looking forward to a far better design and level of efficiency with future greenhouses.

aquaponics,2p9zgb,EternalNoob,3,Sun Dec 14 23:22:31 2014 UTC,That is so fucking metal. I love this idea. So is the fan on the end of the radiator (tubes) furthest from the stove?   EDIT: Actually the whole tubing arrangement is a bit confusing. Why the two sets of tubes going in and out in the second album you posted?
aquaponics,2p9zgb,EternalNoob,2,Sun Dec 14 23:35:56 2014 UTC,This is a two method system.   first the tubes connected to the Buckets and sticking out of the dirt is for constant heat exchanging. On hot days in the greenhouse the hot air is pulled down into the thermal mass/cooled and returned to the greenhouse. At night the opposite happens. (subterranean heating/cooling) http://www.sunnyjohn.com/indexpages/shcs.htm  The second tube runs exhaust from the rocket stove deep into the wet soil inside the thermal mass and back outside.. The rocket stove is only for the really cold days when i need to add some heat to the system. I can make the wet dirt in the mass steam with that stove.   otherwise i am trying to store and release solar heat captured in the greenhouse.

aquaponics,2p9zgb,froschkonig,4,Sun Dec 14 18:20:17 2014 UTC,on a really sunny day like we had friday it was bumping the temp about 20 degrees. in was ~44ish out was ~65ish   about 50 gallons of water goes through the heater in an hour. on my best day i might have 3-4 hours worth of heating +20 degrees and another 2 of heating 5+ degrees.   All in all I warm a few hundred gallons a day in a thousand gallon system.  total water temps climb at least 4-5 degrees during the day even though we have hardly any sunlight this time of year (i thank black pond liner + the solar heater for this).. 7 more days until the sun starts coming back :D
aquaponics,2p9zgb,AnAppleSnail,1 point,Sun Dec 14 18:25:24 2014 UTC,Not bad! Not bad at all. Are you just using pex tubing? Is it a closed loop or are you running your pond water through it?

aquaponics,2p46th,PotentPonics,2,Fri Dec 12 22:40:37 2014 UTC,"I am dosing ~100 gallons of water and my dosing is somewhat (though not completely) dependent on the ph.   I add 7-10 tablespoons of soluble potash(potassium) per week  for the first ~2/3rds of the flower cycle, including the week or so before I switch the plant to flowering light.   I mix my bone meal (phosphorus) in with my hydrated lime at about 2/3 lime 1/3 bonemeal. I add this anytime i need to bump my ph by more than .5. I add this mix one tablespoon at a time and check ph after about an hour (ample time to mix water)  Potassium works a bit to raise ph but not nearly as well as calcium and phosphorus.   If my ph rides high for a while and i need to add more nutrients i bump the ph down (i use standard hydroponic ph down crystals) over a day or so until i have some room to add the nutrients without driving the ph above ~6.5  It is really interesting what happens to the females when they are endlessly deprived of fertilization.. they just pour their little ""hearts"" into it and become amazingly pretty."

aquaponics,2p46th,zynix,1 point,Sat Dec 13 01:51:49 2014 UTC,the fun part about cannabis is that it handles trimming very well and grows very quickly.   Basically my approach was to sit down every day or two and trim out the lower branches and encourage the plant to reach for my screen through many upper branches. I topped the plant twice before it made it to the screen. The topping causes it to produce multiple strong stems low to the grow bed.   Once the tops reach the screen you simply start weaving it in. You leave the little internode growths free to turn up and get stronger (these become bud colas later). When i had a free ~2-3 inches of vertical growth I would tuck it under the next space in the screen.   I Trim fan leaves if they are in the way of young bud development. I want my little bud sites to get all the light they can get.. light and air are the key to dense buds

Aquaponics is a bunch more about being able to keep a healthy, no chemical, natural aquarium. Then Throwing plants in as an afterthought.   Some ground rules (from my perspective)  12 tilapia in a 70 gallon tank are going to produce a large amount of waste (Likely to the point of becoming a problem). And 12 of those fish seems extreme. (tilapia grow large)  Lettuce will go apeshit if you can supply enough light and/or CO2.  You can grow one plant or 50 depending on what you are attempting to do.   PS  I Have two tilapia under 6 inches for ~100 gallons of system and they produce far FAR more Nitrate than I can use. I end up having to water change my way into acceptable levels."
aquaponics,2p1ko0,Sycosys,1 point,Fri Dec 12 04:18:54 2014 UTC,I totally made a mistake I meant 6 tilapia. I've read Silvia Bernstein's Aquaponic Gardening and she recommends 1lb for every 5-10 gallons and a mature tilapia is approx 1.5lb.
aquaponics,2p1ko0,zynix,4,Fri Dec 12 13:35:20 2014 UTC,"Edit - https://srac.tamu.edu/index.cfm/publicHome/ is ~60% of everything you could ever want to know about Aquaculture, Aquaponics, and almost every major commercially viable aquatic creature.   she recommends 1lb for every 5-10 gallons and a mature tilapia is approx 1.5lb.   I've read Sylvia's book, attended her companies summer convention, and read what I can find of her's.  Sylvia is fairly knowledgeable and well read on the subject of Aquaponics.  That said, she glossed over a lot about stocking density.     If you reach max density too early in the plant's development, you'll stunt the fishes growth due to the system barely being able to keep up and there being more ammonia in the system ( yes it's absorbed but not instantly ).    as you reach max density, the water becomes more acidic faster ( the nitrification process releases alot of elemental hydrogen, pH is the measure of free hydrogen in water/soil - http://nitrification.org/ is a good cover on the nitrification process ). reaching max density, you have to be careful about harvesting plants.  Basically sow seeds in 2-4 week gaps.  Otherwise when you harvest your plants without replacements, nitrates will spike, that backs up the nitrification process until you have too much nitrites.  Nitrite is the fish equivalent of carbon-monoxide poisoning. Using W lbs to G gallons is more of a guideline that does not factor in the growth of fish.  I've almost exclusively used a variety of goldfish right now ( I have ~60 minnows but they suck ).  I've setup  and re-setup several systems now ( I hate GrowStone btw ) and the system I've gotten is to start with a couple fish and see how it does, add more, wait and see, stopping when I think I've hit my plant's nitrate needs ( I keep notes, everything is temperature/humidity controlled so they don't deviate too much ).  Ammonia to Nitrate is a ~35-45% efficient process.  When ramped up ( full plants and adding ammonium chloride ) my 50 gallon bed consumes 4-5 grams of nitrates a day so that's around 12-15 grams of ammonia a day. Some reference reading for tilapia ammonia production here http://www.thefishsite.com/articles/136/tank-culture-of-tilapia search for ""Biofilters can be sized by balancing ammonia production rates with ammonia removal rates""   Keep in mind, that last bit is a fairly unique accomplishment on my part.  I'm retired so I have a lot more time to study white papers and research papers, plus I've begun actively breeding bacteria for certain parameters, and I keep meticulous notes.  Lastly I don't like seeing people wasting their money on AP.  Start small and cheap ( my first system cost me 200$, the second one was $400, and the ones I am building now are $1000 a set with the goal of starting a CSA for my neighborhood [ I already have customers ] ).  If you discover you don't like Aquaponics or get discouraged from a total fish loss... atleast you're not out more then ~$200."
aquaponics,2p1ko0,Optimoprimo,2,Fri Dec 12 15:16:34 2014 UTC,"You'll just need to keep a constant eye on your water chemistry. This sounds like lot to me too for a smaller aquarium setup. Larger systems can stock denser because they have better ways of processing waste and spreading out the nutrients by having way more water in the system than is in the aquarium. If you're going to do this, it might be useful to have a large reservoir in a chift pist design."

aquaponics,2p1ko0,pounce,2,Fri Dec 12 14:33:27 2014 UTC,"Is this an indoor system with artficifial lighting? Assuming you have the correct amount of lighting (PAR) for the plants and can maintain CO2 concentrations. You could harvest a head of lettuce just about every weekday. The lettuce would need anywhere from 5-9 weeks from germination to harvest depending upon variety, environmental conditions, and how large you want it to grow.  On the high level something like this is determined using a mass balance equations and modeling the mass transport of nutrients through the system. Typically you are calculating the amount of nitrogen entering the system as feed by: feeding rate, biomass of the fish, protein content of feed. You then take that amount of nitrogen and calculate how will be lost to microbial assimilation, solids capture, de-nitirication. Now you have an estimated amount of nitrogen that remains in the system and is available for nutrient uptake by the plants. You calculate what the nitrogen content of the plant is and what the harvest weight will be. Knowing how long the lettuce should take to grow and how much excess nitrogen is available, you can calculate how many plants will be able to be harvested each week based.  To simplify that: ratios."
aquaponics,2p1ko0,FrostyFish,1 point,Fri Dec 12 15:45:03 2014 UTC,"Hmm... I understood some of that.   To answer your question, I have a south facing window with lots of light it is winter though so I made need to supplement some lighting for a few hours a day."
aquaponics,2p1ko0,obiji,2,Sat Dec 13 03:55:05 2014 UTC,Here's a sizing calculator for you.
aquaponics,2p1ko0,obiji,1 point,Fri Dec 12 16:00:31 2014 UTC,"The general rule of thumb is 1.5x to 2x volume of growspace to stock tank size.  So if you have a 70 gallon stock tank, you need 105 to 140 gallons of grow space.  Surface area and system type will determine the number of heads you can grow per batch.  The typical depth of an aquaponics system is approximately 12 inches.  Some simple calculations would suggest you need at least a 7' x 2' x 12"" growbed (raft).  This would equate to approximately 105 gallon raft bed system.  If you are using a gravel bed, you'll need to account for displacement of the water by gravel.  Do the math of how far apart you are growing each head of lettuce from each other (density?), at about 6"" apart from each other, this would suggest you could grow 13(or14)x3(or 4) heads of lettuce in a raft system so 30 to 60 heads of lettuce."
aquaponics,2p1ko0,pounce,1 point,Fri Dec 12 07:54:49 2014 UTC,Does this also apply to vertical towers?
aquaponics,2p1ko0,youtubefactsbot,1 point,Fri Dec 12 13:41:50 2014 UTC,Not sure how well you can grow lettuce in a vertical tower (i've never tried...would be interesting to see).  I'd recommending trying to stay with as many heads of lettuce as what a raft type setup could handle.
aquaponics,2oyh9x,t1ll,2,Thu Dec 11 08:51:26 2014 UTC,Interesting article. It definitely seems like the thing keeping this from becoming huge is that not a whole lot of people have proved profitability yet.

aquaponics,2oyh9x,NPizzuti,2,Thu Dec 11 16:40:01 2014 UTC,Some operations are using multiple fish?
aquaponics,2oyh9x,dillpiccolol,1 point,Thu Dec 11 16:53:46 2014 UTC,"Most small-midsize operations culture multiple species of fish for a variety of reasons. The biggest reason is that it diversifies income sources and somewhat stabilizes year round production and stocking (species don't grow the same year round and seed is not always available year round). The diversification also reduces risk and expands the number of customers you can serve (this can be a double edge sword). Only once you get to the very large scale systems does it make sense to grow only one species due to economies of scale (vertical integration: feed, broodstock, processing) and specialized equipment/staff."
aquaponics,2oyh9x,pounce,-1,Thu Dec 11 17:19:20 2014 UTC,Could you please add a few words on why this is important?
aquaponics,2oyh9x,TuckBay,3,Thu Dec 11 10:25:07 2014 UTC,"Not entirely sure what you're after, but I'll try. As the title suggests, this paper looks at the production methods, crop and fish yields and profitability of commercial aquaponics internationally (though most data is from the US). Should be an interesting read/skim even for those of us who never intend to be involved in commercial operations. The final paragraph ""... more research and development are needed to determine if aquaponics will evolve into a profitable food production method"" gives you an idea of what conclusions are drawn from the data."
aquaponics,2oyh9x,Optimoprimo,1 point,Thu Dec 11 12:28:54 2014 UTC,So their findings were that they didn't find anything?
aquaponics,2oyh9x,Optimoprimo,2,Thu Dec 11 13:56:17 2014 UTC,"Ok, I'll bite. You're struggling with the wording. No, they found that many respondents have not been profitable in the previous year, but suggest to track how things develop."
aquaponics,2oyh9x,pounce,2,Thu Dec 11 14:48:56 2014 UTC,"That makes more sense. I was just joking at the last paragraph you quoted, since it started with a finding of ""more research is needed"" instead of a yes or no. It is interesting though; I know in the Midwest we have Growing Power, which is pretty profitable. But their focus is urban agriculture, so they aren't ""competing"" with traditional rural farming methods."
aquaponics,2oyh9x,Optimoprimo,1 point,Thu Dec 11 15:20:27 2014 UTC,Since when is Growing Power profitable? I thought they were reliant on donations and grants? Not to mention their status as a non-profit.
aquaponics,2oyh9x,pounce,1 point,Thu Dec 11 16:15:13 2014 UTC,"You're right, profitable was the wrong word. I'm thinking like successful and potentially economy stimulating."
aquaponics,2oyh9x,Optimoprimo,1 point,Thu Dec 11 16:44:16 2014 UTC,Growing Power does not have the best reputation in aquaponics. They provided bad designs and consulting advice to a number of businesses that failed quickly. (Not that they are the only ones to have done this.) Their system design and method of operation is only successful when subsidized by donations and free labor.  It is interesting to see their 'partnership' with Bell Aquaculture. Although it seems more like Bell is looking to sell of old assets/ business (perch) in to pay off debt for their new systems (salmon and feed mill).
aquaponics,2oyh9x,pounce,1 point,Thu Dec 11 17:29:26 2014 UTC,"I'm not disputing you, but in what circles do they have a bad reputation? And is there a list anywhere of these failed businesses? Will Allen won the MacArthur Genius grant for his work in Growing Power. At least in Milwaukee he is spoken of very highly."
aquaponics,2oyh9x,catch_fire,1 point,Thu Dec 11 17:46:01 2014 UTC,"This is a bit of a cop out, but I would rather not disclose who. This was personal communications with people we would associate with as the face of the industry – who would not want this publicly disclosed. Will and his foundation have good intentions and many people do not want to criticize him publicly due to the good his program does.   Will Allen won his MacArthur Genius Grant for community engagement and outreach via growing food specifically ‘community food systems’, not aquaponics or any one specific farming methodology or business. People have just associated him with aquaponics, because that was their first exposure to aquaponics, and in large part responsible for spreading the word of aquaponics. At that time (2008-ish), aquaponics was not well known. He has a great background story and is a popular and charismatic figure head – not unlike some of the other big names in the aquaponics industry who are great entertaining speakers, but lacking in-depth knowledge. It is a story that sells and the press loves to cover it.   A lot of these same people confuse the success of his community engagement and outreach programs for a successful agri-business.  His version of aquaponics fits nicely into his operating conditions/model, and how nutrients are utilized (and recycled) across the various production techniques on their farms. His version of aquaponics does not work outside of that eco system – it’s just not good design (this is a topic in and of itself). A number of farms have tried to use his system – most farms used his tiered system initially and either learned and moved on to another system or failed. Colorado Aquaponics (Growhaus) used it as a small scale to learn from and smartly moved on. Sweetwater attempted to go from broke on a large scale system and did. I know there were several aquaponics facilities in California that also failed with this design, but I can’t explicitly remember their names. It has been a while since I have thought about this system or topic and years since many of these farms were being discussed in media, so I cannot remember as many examples.  Growing Power does have a great reputation in the communities that they are operating in for the work they do, but not the aquaponics community – the two are somewhat mutual exclusive. His focus is really more of a public health program, trying to wrestle food deserts and their impact on diet/heath (diabetes, etc…), and not on trying to build a profitable integrated aquaculture business.  There is a reason he is not frequently discussed anymore in the aquaponics industry. The aquaponics industry matured beyond his system of production, but his system has stayed the same. You could say he had a generation 1 or 2 style system, but the industry is now several more generation in. He is no longer relevant in the concept of commercial aquaponics.  His aquaponics business Is not that different other niche/small market aquaponic farms that rely on donations (classes/seminars) in order to cover production costs."

aquaponics,2owqvj,PASSO3058,3,Wed Dec 10 22:16:55 2014 UTC,"The strong flavor in herbs come from essential oils. The essential oils are produced as a defense mechanism when the plant is stressed or agitated.  It probably isn't very feasible for you to lower the nutrient content of the water by much, but what you can easily do is stress the plant by agitating it.  Putting a fan on it like /u/solisherba suggested could help mimic the gentle agitation it experiences in the outdoor. As it gets stronger you can up the fan speed, softly bend the stems and leaves, and generally be a little rougher with it. Just not so rough you break it. Regular harvesting will go a long way toward increasing potency. It will also help make the plant thicker and bushier rather than thin and leggy. You harvest by cutting off the tips, not uprooting the plant, in case you weren't sure."
aquaponics,2owqvj,ostreatus,2,Thu Dec 11 03:40:23 2014 UTC,I grew some basil in the corner of the bed... And it seems kinda stunted and the leaves seamed extra curly too...  Like it just didn't want to grow out.  I thought it was a wild gene or something...  Could this be the reason too?  Not enough agitation?
aquaponics,2owqvj,ostreatus,1 point,Thu Dec 11 03:44:29 2014 UTC,"There are several reasons it could be curling. First off, many basil varieties have a slight curl to them, but you said extra curly.   Outdoors I would usually attribute this to overwatering. Too much water, toll little water, or too little sunlight are all reasons basil will curl.   It's possible that a fungus disease it causing the leaves to curl.  But what I think is MOST likely is that the water is not only over-nutrified, but too acidic. Too much nutrients can be a problem, but I think the real problem is the acidity. Id the leaves tips or margins are browning, I would guess this is the cause.  So, I'd try using some base down in the water solution (I dont know if this harms the fish??) and if possible provide it some access to sunlight or improve the lighting to be more similar to sunlight.  Never hurts to pop a healthy basil in there and see if it suffers the same effects over time."

aquaponics,2owqvj,SolisHerba,2,Thu Dec 11 00:59:12 2014 UTC,i recommend getting a small fan blowing on the plants and letting the plants dry down to the point of near wilting.   ive noticed my most potent cat nip wilted before i watered it again (in 4 inch container with potting media) i dont recommend that for your plants but drying down will help i believe
aquaponics,2owqvj,SolisHerba,1 point,Thu Dec 11 01:39:43 2014 UTC,What does a small plant blowing on the plants do for it?  Does it actually have something to do with the taste or flavor?
aquaponics,2owqvj,changetip,1 point,Thu Dec 11 02:26:29 2014 UTC,"air circulation will increase transpiration of the plants (help them breathe so to speak) as well as give the plants a jostling which helps hormones and plant nutrients move throughout. i cant tell you with certainty this will help your plants flavor because i have not grown without the use of fans. i can tell you my personal experience at a leafy greens hydro house: didnt use fans near constant watering = limp/weak plant without nice color. using fans and allowing several dry periods a day = nice rigid leaves and bright color. i think this will help your flavor situation but im not 100% sure this is the only ""solution"" needed.   added benefit of keeping unwanted pathogens  away by removing the humid stagnant air."

aquaponics,2ow5lc,PotentPonics,2,Wed Dec 10 22:19:28 2014 UTC,I'll try and look in the next day or two but any of the ones that use 12 volt batteries should work. Make sure the voltage of the model matches the voltage of the battery or you could have a possible dangerous situation on your hands. Also the bigger back up models are way better since they can handle more charge and draw amps. Newer models also have network or usb connection options and can alert you to a power failure with an email or text.

aquaponics,2oshgh,dornforprez,1 point,Wed Dec 10 14:27:40 2014 UTC,"Amazon is not an ideal place for sourcing media.  Even LECA ( light expanded clay aggregate ) is heavy and that increases costs.    If possible, looking for a nearby hydroponic store; if the closest store is 1-2 hours away, just console yourself with the fact that you will only need to go 1x every few months if not for a year.  Lastly, for AP, do not buy GrowStones, they're ~5% carbonates. For a 50 gallon bed would contain 1 Kilogram of calcium carbonate.

If you apply the silicone to the base of the gasket, it can cause it to slip out as you tighten the bulkhead fitting.  You can lay a bead of silicone around an already tightened fitting but in my experience it's not needed."

aquaponics,2orxfv,AllAccessAndy,1 point,Tue Dec 9 21:37:27 2014 UTC,"Over tightening gaskets can cause leaks. They don't need to be as tight as they possibly can to seal correctly. If it was still leaking and popping threads, it may have just been poorly made.  Silicone (silicon is a totally different thing btw) also has no problem being constantly wet. It's the primary sealant used in glass aquariums. It does however only work for sealing against certain materials. I doesn't adhere particularly well to some plastics."
aquaponics,2orxfv,columnmn,1 point,Tue Dec 9 23:08:15 2014 UTC,"There are probably many different types of silicone (my bad on the spelling), and the normal kitchen stuff needs time to dry out after getting wet. I thought the aquarium type wasn't silicone, but an adhesive cement stuff (I've never used it, so not sure)?  I made a bed, and a regular alcohol based one to seal up all the edges, and after a month, it started leaking like a sieve, sucked taking a tonne of gravel out again, killing half the plants, and redoing it with better product.   It might have been cheaper bulkheads (from a big hardware place), but they weren't sealing up, and I kept on tightening until it sealed."

aquaponics,2orxfv,JohnSPledg,1 point,Wed Dec 10 05:37:50 2014 UTC,Bulkreefsupply.com has quality bulkhead fittings.  glass aquariums use 100% silicone.  when using any silicone with fish make sure you don't use a silicone containing fungicides.  Those are toxic to fish.  If using GE silicone II give the silicone a couple of weeks to off gas before filling the system.  I have had friends wipe out their tanks using it to build filters and putting the filters on-line before the silicone II had fully cured.
aquaponics,2orxfv,ToMetric,1 point,Wed Dec 10 08:10:54 2014 UTC,Thanks. I definitely made sure I bought silicone that is safe for use with fish. The 100 gallon stock tank that I bought has a drain.

You're already thinking too hard by trying to set up three tanks with three different species, one of which is very difficult to keep. While it's doable (here at UW Milwaukee we even have sturgeon), it's best kept for seasoned hobbyists. You'll find that the fish portion of aquaponics is pretty simple while upkeep of the growbed and crops take some learning. Make sure your tank is properly cycled and aerated before stocking. Stick to something simple to start, like goldfish. Once you successfully have a stable system with growing plants and fish, you'll probably already have a feel for how to improve on what you did.

aquaponics,2oofj6,motherofdragonfly,4,Mon Dec 8 20:13:22 2014 UTC,"Easiest thing to do is to stagger your plantings so that as you use up some of your crop, you have younger plants filling in the gaps.   I've found that I can space my plants much closer in my AP systems than in my tradition soil-based garden since the plants aren't fighting for nutrients. I usually direct seed my lettuce right into the media, or I'll pull seedlings from one bed to fill in the gaps in another and I don't hassle too much with specific spacing--if the plants look crowded, I'll just dig s few out and move them, or toss the young plant into a salad and eat it as microgreens.  The tomatoes, eggplant, and peppers can each go on trellis so once those start growing upwards, you'll gain more space in your beds. For the basil, parsley, and cilantro, you can pack them in pretty tight and just thin as you need them. I tend to keep my basil plants fairly small so that I can use them up before they bolt."

aquaponics,2oofj6,Whittigo,1 point,Tue Dec 9 15:18:41 2014 UTC,"I have PVC tubes with flowing water with 2"" net pots about 8 "" apart filled with hydroton suspended in them. First run through I thinned out my lettuce seedlings down to the strongest plant and slowly picked full leaves for harvesting. It worked but I wasn't happy with it, not great leaves and slow harvest. I now just sprinkle in 5 or so seeds per pot and let them go wild. After about 5-6 weeks I just harvest the entire pot all at once. No ill effects from growing 5 or so plants right on top of each other, and the bunches of lettuce come out looking picture perfect like on a commercial.   I'd say don't worry at all about putting them right on top of each other as long as you have enough light and water for them. And what kind of media are you using? If you're using hydroton just sprinkle your seeds right into the media and give it a little prodding to make sure the seeds get down to the wet area and they should sprout no problem. I'm amazed at the sprouting power of hydroton."
aquaponics,2oodjn,trickynicky666,3,Mon Dec 8 19:57:41 2014 UTC,"The Wheatgrass was probably in a nice equilibrium with the nutrient supply in the tank; once you harvested it, there was less uptake of the nutrients and caused a cascade of effects in the tank. This would explain the algea. I would test your water chemistry to see if anything is out of wack. It's nice to have some plants that are growing while others are harvested. This keeps some kind of plant life always available to uptake nutrients and avoids abrupt changes in your nutrient cycle. You may want to start harvesting your Wheatgrass in a gradual sequence instead of all at once."

aquaponics,2oaqin,hackshack40,6,Thu Dec 4 21:22:28 2014 UTC,"Yes it is a good idea to add some filtration. A well built settling tank, like a swirl filter or radial flow filter is all you really need, but some mechanical filtration is a great next step. You can certainly get away without dedicated filtration, but there are several drawbacks to ""no filter"" systems:  1: A pump that moves dirty water clogs quicker and loses power over time. Then you have to clean the poop out to get it running again, eww. This can be as often as every week or two in a highly stocked system. Always place pumps at the lowest point of the system, after the filtration step. Airlifts are an exception to the clogging rule, but are tough to master.   2: Hydroponic subsystems will clog, yes even media beds. Anyone who tells you that worms alone will keep a bed flowing cleanly has not maintained a media bed over multiple seasons. Going without a filter will save you time in the beginning, but means much more time you need to spend cleaning over the long run, in any type of system. This is probably the least fun part of AP and filters make it a lot less messy. Plus, particulate-free water is necessary to get those fluffy white roots we all love to show off.   3: You lose a degree of control over your ammonia and nitrate. Should one spike, it is nice to be able to simply empty the filter and lessen the issue.   4.1: Bacterial colonies are less stable without a filter. Filters typically involve a lot of internal surface area, which means more homes for bacteria and ultimately larger, more robust colonies that prevent crashing in the event of a fish death or other unexpected event.   4.2: Starting new systems is a little slower. It is really nice to be able to move a quantity of established filter media into a new system to give it a biological starter culture that lessens cycling times. Transferring AP water helps too.   5: Localize and contain the smell of waste as it is digested. A radial flow filter smells a whole heck of a lot less than a media bed with zero prefiltration.  edit: numbering"

aquaponics,2oaqin,FrostyFish,2,Fri Dec 5 23:56:56 2014 UTC,"These benefits are all true.  However, I would temper them slightly.  For instance, I've maintained media beds for several seasons without clogging.  I know someone who's maintained them for 7 years in beds that were designed to avoid clogging.  That said, they all clog eventually.  Ammonia spikes are not a frequent occurrence in systems above 200 gallons.  For instance, I've been running 48 months (including with heavy stocking in 50 degree water) and have never had one.  They do happen, though, based on forum comments I've read.  Bacterial colonies can be maintained at a very stable level in media beds.  Filtration is a great idea and more and more people are doing it, but it's not essential - especially if you don't stock heavily."

aquaponics,2oaqin,PotentPonics,-1,Fri Dec 5 18:49:26 2014 UTC,I think it depends on your stocking level and system diversity. I know more than a few people with beds well over 4 or 5 years old who don't have clogging issues.

In my experience in most smaller systems with proper worm diversity you don't need a prefilter for a flood and drain unless your running really high fish concentrations. For raft systems ABSOLUTELY you need to keep the junk off the roots. Always get a good laugh out of the filterless raft systems. Sure its cheaper but it also doesn't work.

aquaponics,2o6j4k,Nick_Burns_ThatsMe,7,Wed Dec 3 19:22:44 2014 UTC,Hi Nick.  Wish I had time for a longer response (maybe later).  For now I'd encourage you to check out the following:   Chinese-style greenhouses built at the University of Manitoba Penn & Cord  Synergistic  The work of Jerome Ostentowski at CRMPI Jonathan Bates bioshelters from Food Forest Farm (not to far from you)   Penn & Cord's designs are quite attractive.  Jonathan might be willing to drive up and help build one for you.  It sounds like you're thinking through the questions well.  One thing to know is that polycarb degrades faster than acrylic in the sun.
aquaponics,2o6j4k,FrostyFish,2,Wed Dec 3 23:46:05 2014 UTC,"What coverings are made from acrylic? Are you referring to Solexx? Polyfilm is probably made from the same material as polycarb panels, but just guessing."
aquaponics,2o6j4k,FrostyFish,3,Thu Dec 4 15:19:29 2014 UTC,"I think Solexx is polycarbonate.    Here's a discussion.  The issue is that acrylic is rigid and inflexible, whereas polycarb can bend.  Acrylic is also a bit harder to attach.  However it will give you 20 years compared to 10 for polycarb."

If the system is deficient in Phosphorous or has plants that readily consume it, then its good. Adding it to a balanced system, where it might become in excess could cause harm. Cyanobacteria love this stuff and it can spur toxic algae blooms if they are present (among other things). As a gardener and an aquatic plant grower, my biggest problems have come from Phosphorous. That's not to say, not to use it, but use it wisely, and remember that there is a caveat."
aquaponics,2o2t24,Optimoprimo,2,Wed Dec 3 08:04:10 2014 UTC,"True enough... in terms of relative ""strength""...  But having said that... Phosphoric acid has the molecular formula H3PO4....  The energy required to break the molecular bond is much greater compared to Hydrochloric Acid (HCl)....which donates it's single proton more readily to other anions...  (Hence it's relative weakness in comparison to Hydrochloric acid...)  If Phosphoric Acid loses all three protons -- as would happen in an alkaline solution (high pH source water) -- the remaining ion is the phosphate ion, PO4 with a -3 charge....  Phosphate ions can combine with calcium ions to form calcium phosphate, a highly insoluble compound... a much more likely scenario in a high pH water hardness...  Any compound ""salts"" that precipitate.. by definition... means that the anion is bound... and therefore unavailable for plant assimilation..."
aquaponics,2o2t24,Aquaponics-Heretic,4,Wed Dec 3 00:33:25 2014 UTC,"I'll help you out a little bit. Firstly, when an acid loses protons, it doesn't really cost energy, and it's not really a broken bond, it just dissociates. It's ionic. Secondly, with all of your explanation, you are searching for the term ""pKa,"" also known as the acid dissociation constant. What you are trying to explain is that HCl has a much lower pKa than H3PO4. And you are correct! But in the interest of simplicity, I went with the word ""strong.""    Finally, you are correct that calcium phosphate can precipitate calcium, this is actually how most cities coat their lead pipes; by loading the drinking water with phosphate. The added phosphate causes calcium to precipitate on the inside of the pipes, preventing the lead from leeching into the drinking water. This should not be an issue in an aquaponic system, however. For one, the phosphate concentration would have to be obnoxiously high for significant precipitation, and you just don't add THAT much to lower your pH. Also the plants and bacteria in the system will digest the phosphate so quickly that it won't be around to accumulate and react with anything. Finally, the whole point of adding phosphoric acid is to lower pH, so by adding it, you don't have an alkaline environment for significant precipitation to occur."

Agreed... the amounts being added are small... but if added to high carbonate alkaline source water... are much more likely to precipitate.. and thus be unavailible....  Any lack of ""phosphates"" or other trace element anions... due to high pH... is completely due to the fact that they're ""locked out"" of soluble uptake by the plants...  Treating your ""alkaline"" top up water volume... to a point of pH neutrality, or lower... is the typical recommended treatment)...  The trace elements can/will remain in an unsoluble in-motile form unusable to plants... iron is a particular example...  until your pH slowly declines once the general carbonate hardness is consumed through nitrification....  If you treat the entire system volume at once to lower pH (don't)... then certainly the trace element anions are more available for uptake... (and much more likely to dissassociate into soluble forms)  With more availability.. comes more growth... which means more, quicker uptake of excess ""nutrients"""
aquaponics,2o2t24,PotentPonics,1 point,Wed Dec 3 03:02:40 2014 UTC,Absolutely. Your only helping your plants bloom and branch more with adding phosphate. Most AP systems are slightly low on phosphate so adding it is only beneficial. The other benefit is you can pour most AP grade phosphoric acid on your hand and as long as you wash it off you'l be fine. Now do that with hydrochloric acid and tell me how that goes. It's a no brainer when it comes to which one you would rather put in your body.
aquaponics,2o2t24,MorePrecisePlease,1 point,Wed Dec 3 01:55:12 2014 UTC,By AP grade I was referring to food grade. As far as not needing more phosphate for growing greens that might be the case but not in my system where I'm growing plants like cannabis with higher nutrient requirements to get the growth I'm looking for. Any one can grow lettuce rafts or greens its when you hit the heavy flowering fruiting stuff where the addition of phosphates and other suppliments can really help with yields at least with the plant species I'm working with which is primarily cannabis and hops.

aquaponics,2o2t24,Optimoprimo,1 point,Wed Dec 3 01:16:48 2014 UTC,"I'd have to disagree with this, firstly that all acids would act similarly. Due to the severe differences in pKa, HCl would have a much stronger influence if it was not properly diluted and mixed. An unmixed portion of 1M HCl would cause a much stronger reaction than 1M H3PO4. Most large-scale aquaculture sytems will use phosphoric acid to both lower the pH and fertilize when the phosphate levels are too low. Phosphate is almost always the limiting nutrient in freshwater systems, so plants will readily use any extra they can get. If you are having algal issues in your water, then your issue is too much lighting in your tank and too few plants/too many fish."

If it wasn't the case... most of the hobby farm CSA growers... with low fish stocking densities/feed rates.... would have fallen flat on their faces within months...

aquaponics,2o2t24,Optimoprimo,0,Wed Dec 3 02:55:45 2014 UTC,"I'd have to disagree with this, firstly that all acids would act similarly. Due to the severe differences in pKa, HCl would have a much stronger influence if it was not properly diluted and mixed. An unmixed portion of 1M HCl would cause a much stronger reaction than 1M H3PO4.   True...  The larger the pKa value, the more dissociation of the molecules in solution and thus the stronger the acid. Thus, a strong acid ""wants"" to get rid of its hydrogen ion, much more so than a weak acid....  That's what I said... Hydrochloric Acid... with a single H+ proton... is much more likely (needs less energy)... to donate a proton.... than the three H+ protons of Phosphoric Acid.... (a stronger bond)"

aquaponics,2o2t24,PotentPonics,1 point,Wed Dec 3 03:54:47 2014 UTC,You get algae from to much light on your water if you have algae issues you should be covering your tanks and any other exposed water. Adding phosphate to an AP system in most cases is beneficial as most systems run low on phosphates thanks to the plants doing a great job of using up what's in the water. Adding phosphates helps not only with blooming but branchy of your plants which is important for certain plants full potential. Yes it can cause some algae but a properly setup AP system won't have algae issues any way.
aquaponics,2o2t24,Aquaponics-Heretic,2,Wed Dec 3 05:56:36 2014 UTC,Adding phosphates helps not only with blooming   Potassium is probably more likely to be an issue at flowering/seeding/fruiting stages of growth... than phosphorus....  There is a general obsession with phosphate usage... a carry over from soil based growing.....   Or in relation to stuff like marijuana... where it might be more applicable...
aquaponics,2o2t24,PotentPonics,1 point,Wed Dec 3 01:53:47 2014 UTC,Yea I am mostly growing herb in my greenhouse. I have found it helpful in what I am growing. I do also grow veggies and a few other medicinal herbs like kanna and cowitch beans but mostly working on aquaponic cannabis production. Not going to lie the flavor is amazing and some of our early lab testing is showing higher CBDs than both controls(hydro and soil) which is at the for front of medical research around medicinal cannabis use. This is a big deal to me as I have both celiac and IBS so cannabis oil really has helped me put weight back on and stop the horrendous intestinal pain I had before moving to a legal medical state. Potassium is also important but you need the right balance of phosphate and potassium for at least the plants I am growing and it would seem from my peppers and others that they seem to like it a lot too.

Most fish foods are relatively low unless your also supplementing with peas or some other green where are you accounting for the regular addition of phosphate?  I have only really run into phosphate issues with cannabis and strawberrys just curious as to what plants you saw it on. The biggest thing it helps with or seems to help with any way with my plants is node spacing and branch production per node.

The vast majority of the phosphorus in fish feeds is just passed through into waste... the two major components of fish wastes are nitrogen and phosphorus....  Yes, phosphate deficiencies are MUCH more likely to occur in marijuana growth (not sure I really understand why)... and pot growing is the ONLY real example of possible phosphate deficiencies that I've ever seen in AP systems"
aquaponics,2o2t24,Optimoprimo,1 point,Wed Dec 3 03:01:48 2014 UTC,Really? I have noticed an improvement in the flowering of both my tomatoes and peppers since regularly adding phosphate. Theres a few different ways I have found are ok to add it has made a bigger difference especially in both squashes and peppers I have noticed. Much more minor on my tomatoes but still enough to notice. Cannabis is a nutrient drain it will stip your phosphate iron and nitrates right out of the water faster than anything else I have seen lol No idea why it does but man does it suck nutrients. Not sure if its legal where you are but fortunately enough for me it is where I live. Best of luck on your future growing. Thanks for sharing.

Pond liner and wooden beds being the next cheapest option, both items can be found at big box hardware stores.

The temperature controller is an STC1000, commonly used for homebrewing but it works great for the tank as well, the temperature probe it comes with is water proof, and its cheap. The heater is a 5 gallon bucket heater, designed to get 5 gallons quite hot, but does a good job of keeping 250 gallons at 65. http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000BDB4UG/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o02_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1  Right now it's in the 40s outside overnight, but usually in the 50-60 range, with really cold snaps to the 20s. I have my system in a plastic tarp greenhouse. The tarp just keeps the wind out because its too thin to actually hold any heat. I'm upgrading to a ""real"" greenhouse type of 6 mil sheeting that should help hold in heat and maybe reduce the time the heater has to stay operational.  I also have a mini rocket mass heater I built on the side of the tank as an experiment. The exhaust runs through about 60lbs of sand stacked against the side of my wood and pond liner tank before exiting out the top of the greenhouse. Plan was to run that for a few hours before really cold nights, heat up the sand and help keep the side of the tank warm. In reality I dont think the heat is transferring through the wooden walls the tank much if at all. And any ambient heating the sand and heater are doing is being lost through the thin plastic sheeting. I'm interested in seeing how that changes with the thicker plastic too. I only just got the mass heater working though, so it doesn't influence what I said about the water heater."

How much did it cost you and how permanent is it designed to be? I'll be moving soon or at least eventually and I'll be revamping and upgrading my system when I do and want to put it in a greenhouse as well. Considering between a hoop house style one like you posted or just biting the bullet and spend more money to build a more traditional hard plastic paned one.
aquaponics,2nylpq,Whittigo,2,Tue Dec 2 13:50:05 2014 UTC,"The greenhouse is 30x50 feet. It is 15 years old, on it's second piece of property (moved it 12 years ago) and has had the cover replaced 3 times.   You could buy a commercial house similar to this for like $7000 complete with environmental controls (heater, fans, thermostats, etc.) To build a hoophouse like this is pretty easy. You grade the area you are going to build it nice and level. Then you put in a perimeter of short posts (cemented in like building a fence). Then you start assembling the hoops, install purlins, build the end walls and then install your covering. In my area they aren't considered permanent structures and they don't require permitting or inspection. I would highly suggest getting a pro electrician though. Do your electrical to code.  My hoophouse uses two layers of greenhouse film that is inflated with a small fan to create an insulative envelope. It works pretty good and these films typically last 10 years if you're careful. I also have a framed in and insulated North wall. I would be interested in the R value difference between my covering and the corrugated polycarbonate sheets. They certainly have better impact resistance and look a whole heckuva lot better!  I will say that a hoophouse without vertical walls down the length is much stronger in the wind or if you happen to get snow load. Inflated hoophouses also don't do well if the power goes out. High winds, rain or snow mess them up quickly.  Hope that helps!"

I'm replacing an end wall right now and just bought some sheets of 8mm triple wall poly panels. I REALLY like this stuff as it is very impact resistant and has a slightly higher R value compared to the inflated film I currently use. I would love to eventually cover my whole greenhouse in it.  Another material that I would like to try is SolaWrap. It looks like some pretty awesome stuff. I stumbled across it while shopping for the liner I'm using in my system. You can find it at Global Plastic Sheeting. They REALLY hooked me up and their customer service/shipping is top notch.

Just a rough estimate on the first prices I could fine, looks like replacing 2 layers of 6 mil at 30x50 would be about $500. Same amount of solawrap at $25 a foot per 3 meter width would be $3750. So if you are replacing your film every 5 years, and they say this stuff is lasting 30, eventually you will save money, but that is a large initial investment.  Looking at it I agree with you, I'd really like to try it out. But I don't think I'll be spending that much initially."

I just started it because I thought it would be so much easier since they don't prefer light and don't really care for any of the plants I put in their tanks so there isn't any competition for growth.

Tiny flies/gnats would get stuck to the stems or leaves and then die, either from being stuck or nicotine poisoning I'm not sure. In the future I might keep 1 or 2 plants in close proximity to whatever else I'm growing just as a pesticide.   Having the pots in my channels has been really useful so far, I've been able to move them around as needed and I'm not using as much GrowStone this way.  My next attempt will definitely have shallower channels, also I've got to find a better way to drain water instead of using epoxy to seal the holes and hoping for the best.

If you've got a crowded garden you might want to trim the leaves as they get larger, you can cut and place them around the base of another plant that's getting ravaged by bugs to help deter them somewhat. I've also heard of people cutting up the leaves in strips and soaking them in water, and then using that water in a spray bottle as pesticide.   The entire plant is quite sticky with nicotine while it's green, it can be absorbed through the skin so keep this in mind if you're handling it a lot and are not a user of tobacco.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Tobacco_Sickness"

Bigger leaves than what I've grown might help too, I cut mine as soon as they start to turn yellow to allow them to grow as big as possible. I think each plant will only grow a certain amount of leaves and the larger the better, both for sheer volume of plant matter and bigger leaves = easier wraps for cigars.   I'm curious about plant variety though, I've only tried this strain since it was kind of an impulse buy. It's something I don't know a whole lot about but I'm sure there are some sites that sell higher quality seeds than what I've got."

We did some research and it turns out there is an entire class of pesticides based off the nicotine molecule - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neonicotinoid  Otherwise, it's not necessary to grow tobacco alongside plants to guard them; I know radish & spinach will affect each other tastewise so tobacco might have a similar influence.  Instead since you have pure tobacco leaf, if you take your trimmings and grind & dry them up into a powder/ash, you can mix that powder into a spray bottle as needed.  This is also considered an ""certified organic"" pesticide - http://www.colostate.edu/Dept/CoopExt/4DMG/VegFruit/organic.htm  Anyone else that reads this, baring growing your own tobacco, don't try this at home.  A lot of the free leaf tobacco sold has been free based ( same as crack ) with ammonia or adulterated in other ways that will taint plants.

aquaponics,2nha6a,Verusauxilium,1 point,Wed Nov 26 19:08:44 2014 UTC,Care to elaborate?
aquaponics,2nha6a,Pastelitomaracucho,13,Wed Nov 26 20:08:53 2014 UTC,"Sure.   This is not more than backyard aquaponics with bells and whistles. How are you going to solve world hunger with small scale technology (which can't compete commercially) that also requires heavy investments for environmental control and energy efficiency? How do you go to a place like Somalia, where there isn't any water and money to start with, with a system like this?   Do these people have any idea of what a value chain is? Do people in this subreddit know what are the main bottlenecks to aquaculture and therefore aquaponic production, both in the developed and the third world? Seed and feed.  Production of fingerlings is not enough. Everyone wants to grow fish but little people want to breed them. Thus, seed is expensive and a potentially lucrative business.  And then you have the problem of being able to supply the growers with quality and affordable feed: you need feed mills. You need agriculture to support the feed mills and you need access to fish meal which can cost 1000 Euros a ton.   Literally, how the fuck is anyone thinking about solving world hunger by missing these white elephants and going for a glorified backyard hobbyist technology?   You don't need geothermal, you don't need wind and solar. You don't even need aquaponics. You need to start at the base. You need to farm grains and vegetables, you need access to water, you need to have access to world commodities and you need peace in order to even start thinking about tackling world hunger. Get fucking real.   The only system that has proven to be commercially viable through years of research and demonstration is the UVI system and yet that system gets to survive because it can sell produce on where big companies can't compete: on the middle of the Caribbean sea. Even commercial systems in other islands such as Hawaii have failed due to crippling running costs. If some production method is lacking the economies of scale to be sustainable at the moment, that is aquaponincs.   You wanna go local and organic and target first world people with too much choices in life?  Support this then."
aquaponics,2nha6a,SketchySkeptic,5,Wed Nov 26 22:08:35 2014 UTC,"My fucking God thank you, I have been researching aquaponics for years and the conclusion you eventually reach is that it is not a commercially competitive venture, until you are facing a resource crunch. In the face of priced water, it will become much more viable. It is a matter of social responsibility, not profit.  Regarding what you said about Somalia, don't even get me started on the unseen effects of attempting to feed and help people that neither want or need help. Humanitarian aid to Africa has, believe it or not, destroyed the entire country.   All that being said I do believe that aquaponics is a fledgling industry and that with the proper environmental and biological control, could solve many problems in the United States. I think we need to figure out a way to reliably produce feed from insect larvae, which are treated with iron and calcium powder before being fed to the fish as a replacement for fish meal.   You are 100% correct about UVI also, that system is incredible but  only does well because it's right there in at john which has no farming culture to speak of."
aquaponics,2nha6a,Pastelitomaracucho,5,Wed Nov 26 23:46:26 2014 UTC,"Its (mostly) all about economies of scale. In fish farming, we can make 1 person produce 10 tons of fish a year or 500 tons of fish a year. Same man hours. Same guy. But 50 times more production. How? By designing BIG. Big is what gets you bulk feed which is cheaper to transport, bulk oxygen, which is cheaper, access to large clients such as supermarkets and an overall much lower cost of production per kilogram of fish.   That's why you can buy chicken for cheap: a single worker can slaughter 2000 animals a day. That's why salmon today is an accessible product and not a delicacy of the gods: a single site can produce 2000 tons a year with 4 or 5 workers. And we are not even close to what chicken farming has achieved.   Even with a resource crunch, other technologies might be more competitive. Take for example drip irrigation developed by the Israelis: saves a ton of water and you can order everything you need online and start right away. Yes, some higher yields can be achieved with AP in some plants, but higher labour input will make the systems less competitive unless we end up automating most of the farming process or when we really come up with designs that can make use of economies of scale."

aquaponics,2nha6a,Pastelitomaracucho,3,Wed Nov 26 22:20:57 2014 UTC,"Thanks. I might sound ranty, but having seen hunger with my own eyes and having seen that even with a wealth of knowhow at my disposal I can't do much about it, it really frustrates me that people can miss the big picture so spectacularly."
aquaponics,2nha6a,Pastelitomaracucho,-5,Wed Nov 26 22:31:07 2014 UTC,"The whole point of this project is to create a foundation in the United States that provides the economic backbone for running these facilities in developing nations. We do have too many choices in life and to many companies take all their profits and stick in a bank somewhere.   These systems use an advanced vertical design that is hardly backyard aquaponics.   When building the systems in these countries we go and educate them on how to operate them, so they do know the science behind the process, how to maintain it, and what problems they might run into.   Ground water is available in nearly all of Africa, but they don't have the resources to drill for it, or the infrastructure. We're providing that. Its a long term goal that is not going to happen overnight, but the collaborative effort makes a difference in years to come.   Using the passive geothermal and rammed earth in the facilities reduces the need for environmental control systems like heating and cooling and is a building technique already widely used there and in most countries. Our systems are designed to be energy efficient and we're providing production units.   Fish feed can be grown from duckweed and arugula sprouts. A recent study by the Florida International University proved that it was more efficient and healthy for the fish. This is the form of feed we have already been using with success. Add some red worms into the system and you balance out some of your micro nutrient content as well. Once a system is stocked and running a portion of it goes towards maintaining the fish population and seed stock. You don't need feed mills you need a system designed to sustain itself, which is what we have done.   We are starting at the the base, in a developed country with hundreds of Aquaponics operations running across the nation that are all holding their own. We don't do just aquaponics either. We've designed fodder systems, a new form of solar energy collection, and do consulting and education programs here in our community.   All this goes towards creating sustainable communities abroad. Things are very real in these countries, political climates can be unstable and dangerous and people don't know how to even start to fix their living conditions.   So we start small, like you said, at the base and we slowly build up one community at a time. This is the beginning to a much larger effort and we are collaborating with many people to make it a reality. 10 years from now we'll be building sustainable communties all over the world, and they'll be pointed in the right direction.  This isn't some bandaid solution we're trying to throw at them and say good luck. This is a support structure for developing communities that can take care of themselves, and who better to fund it than the people who already have too much?"
aquaponics,2nha6a,Pastelitomaracucho,2,Wed Nov 26 22:35:48 2014 UTC,"I really do not want to be picky and I really wish initiaves like this have a future.   1) can you explain me what is so advanced about the vertical system? Why do you need to go vertical when pumping higher means more running costs?   I know a robust aquaponic design can be forgiving to the user. But how do you make sure an uneducated farmer in Nicaragua knows how to service a pump, how to make an alkalinity adjustment, how to check for disease? In a one month training course? You can't. I have PhDs calling my on my phone because they forgot how to backwash a upflow reactor.   Duckweed may sound perfect, but is not. You cannot feed tilapia entirely on duckweed without compromising SGR. Duckweed works at inclusions of up to 20% and there is a reason why commercial fish growers aim for the highest quality feed they can afford: the sooner you bring your fish to market, the less it costs them to produce it. I am sorry, but you do need access to agricultural commodities and your assumption that you can run a commercially competitive operation out of duckweed is wrong.   And I get you can easily produce your own tilapia fry, but it wont be long until tour stock starts suffering from inbreeding unless you have access to quality fry responsibly produced through breeding programmes that generally do not occur in the hungry part of the world.

aquaponics,2nha6a,Pastelitomaracucho,-2,Wed Nov 26 23:00:09 2014 UTC,"I get your concerns. My main point here is we're not going to be building facilities over seas tomorrow. Our first operations go up here and we have 20 acres to continue to expand on to work out some of these problems.   Our vertical towers allow for 250-500 plants to be grown on 50sq ft, lighting was the biggest problem here, figuring out proper spacing so the plants wouldn't ""leg"". 4 banks of this size can run off a single small pump with little problem. We filter all the water before its introduced into the system and have simple return filters with traps that are easy to clean out. We have never had the need for a UASB.   Everything is designed to be as simple and labor effective as possible. We're not just doing a 1 month course, our plans are to have at least one person employed by our company that would stay there for 6 months to year providing proper education.   Duckweed isn't perfect and I misstated arugula before, I meant amaranth. Addressing the sustainable feed issue is a top priority and there are many institutes already farther ahead than we are for this. Black soldier flies and worm colonies are also good additions to help alleviate the need for commercial feeds.     Again our backbone state side is what will make this possible especially in many areas you mentioned. We have a couple other technologies we are developing, including a very inexpensive solar unit with 80% collection rating, that we will be selling to help boost our profits to further this endeavor.   In short, isn't it at least worth trying? To build an organization who's sole goal it to provide more efficient technology for our own communities and those that need it the most.  This is just the means to an end, and the start of a very long journey. One more think tank in the pool of sustainable research.   Also I appreciate your feed back, you have present a lot of questions that we should probably present more clearly in our campaign."

But as you say, 1 step at a time. Getting close to something that will help in fighting world hunger will take many years of painful research, failures and trying and trying again. Saying now, that the project idea is going to solve one of humanity's biggest challenges raises the expectations beyond of what you can answer at the moment.   You need to polish this enough, provide basic figures how much will the system cost and how much can it produce. What's the total electricity consumption, water usage, and which other inputs are needed (for example addition of pH buffers or carbon sources). Expected running costs, expected growth rates, etc...

I commend you for your accomplishments and your progress in Germany.   I have seen many Aquaponics companies rely to heavily on fish production for profits, and I have seen others do very well on profits balancing fish and produce production.  We do well with that balance and have diversified our services enough to make a substantial amount of revenue. The fodder systems on their own can support the overhead costs. Livestock feed is a big thing in this country and in our setup the aquaponics lends a hand to the fodder systems which have a turn around time of 6 days. This small facility can produce 4 tons of feed a day, and it sits on an 1/10th of an acre. Keep in mind that's in addition to the produce being grow."

aquaponics,2ngldm,Aquaponics-Heretic,3,Fri Nov 28 23:12:30 2014 UTC,"Furthermore, water cannot provide enough oxygen for them to efficiently oxidise ammonia.   I skimmed your material and while non of it is bad information, it didn't take long to find a false claim, which wouldn't be much of a deal besides the fact you operate and design your system based around this incorrect data.  In a healthy system you should never have more than 5ppm ammonia and never more than 1ppm nitrite.  The saturation value for oxygen in water in around 8ppm at 70F.  The chemical equation for ammonia to nitrite requires 2 oxygen and 3 ammonia.  Getting water ay 70F to 5ppm DO is optimal for your aquaculture anyways.  Given these values not only will your nitrosomonas (or w.e. else might be converting) never be able to use beyond the saturation value of O2 in H20, but you should be achieving beyond that limit for your fish anyways which is still less than maximum saturation value.  The same holds true for nitrite to nitrate which requires 2:1  So to make this easier to read:   Oxygen : Other molecule ammonia -> nitrite needs 2:3 while max ammonia should be less than 5ppm and saturation value of O2 in H20 at 70F ~8ppm with optimum DO at >5ppm and optimum ammonia <1ppm (both of which can be achieved with many techniques) nitrite -> nitrate 1:12 same for max DO, and optimum DO, but nitrite should normally (and of course optimally) well under 1ppm   My point is just that a flood and drain system isn't better than even constant flood systems in terms of oxygen requirements and a further point is that flood and drain systems are harder to maintain and more error prone than the simpler systems that exist.  Hope I'm not sounding too cynical or negative, as you seem to have done a great job with most of the information, just wanted to point out a mistake that could lead to serious design complexity when it isn't necessary.  Also worth nothing, the microbiology in a flood and drain is still only getting the O2 from DO.  They will never be exposed to atmosphere os even if it were the case waters saturation value at normal temps were too low, a flood and drain would do nothing to remedy that.  edit: typo"

And since ""you operate and design your argument based around this incorrect data"" - you are promoting false information.  Water CANNOT (alone) provide enough oxygen for AOM's to efficiently oxidise ammonia - COMPARED to a system that allows massive aeration AND exposure to atmospheric oxygen via surfaces - i.e. flood and drain. AOMs are NOT solely bound to water. Therefore it is an incorrect statement.  Otherwise, please explain how and why your theory that AOMs only oxidise ammonia IN water is true. Because it is not."

Good luck to you should you decide to actually pursue improving peoples lives with your business.  In the event you just want to pretend you are right without even remotely trying to back up your words with science, then I don't wish you any luck.  We're all entitled to our own opinions, but we're only entitled to one set of facts.   Water CANNOT (alone) provide enough oxygen for AOM's to efficiently oxidise ammonia - COMPARED to a system that allows massive aeration AND exposure to atmospheric oxygen via surfaces - i.e. flood and drain   Cool, that's why I said there are many techniques for aerating your water and never said ""water alone"" (I presume you mean just letting water sit stagnant).  Flood and drain does provide lots of surface area for gas exchange thus putting more oxygen into solution because it exists in higher saturation in the atmosphere, but like I said, your bacteria are still completely covered by water and never come in direct contact with the atmosphere.  Even still, let's pretend they did come in contact with the atmosphere.  Do you know what bacteria are made of?  Do you know how obtain the oxygen they use?  They are 80-90% water and take a wild guess at how they take in oxygen.  That's right, by gas exchange with the water they are composed of, so basically you are trying to argue that the water inside this bacteria   a) comes in contact with atmosphere and   b) is some special water that has a higher saturation value  neither of which are true.  When you drain water from a your system for a few minutes, it's just common sense to know that it doesn't become completely dry and as you've said in your own article the bacteria does not exist in any amount worth mentioning unless it's colonizing on some substrate.  Microorganisms are extremely small and exist primarily only under the thin film of water that would be left behind after you drain your media, that's why it doesn't matter.    You are debunked. Otherwise, please explain how and why your theory that AOMs only oxidise ammonia in water is true. It is not.   Well strictly speaking, no they can't oxidize ammonia without water because they are made of water and the oxidation takes place inside its own cell wall.  However, I never even made this argument so I don't know why you're acting like you're rebutting something I've said previously.  Look, man, you obviously don't know what you're talking about.

While it's likely archaea exist and help with nitrification cycle in aquaponics there is no peer reviewed science that I know that explicitly states how much of the nitrification in an aquaponics system would take place on account of archaea.  We do know that the bacteria exist, however, hence my focus on them.  However, since we're bringing archaea into this conversation for no reason at all, let's mention that archaea haven't been studied in depth and to my knowledge we don't even know the mechanism they use to participate in the nitrification cycle.   They can exist outside of water submersion. They exist in most ecological niches.   While true that doesn't address the fact that almost your entire system will be coated with water the entirety of its life.  As such your statement that water cannot hold enough saturated oxygen to provide enough for the AOMs is entirely untrue.   A thin water covering beats a thick water covering for gas-exchange.    True, I've already stated as much and I actually gave the reason why this is true.  If you want to actually defend my main argument against your misinformation, then answer the following.   How much more oxygen does a flood in drain system provide the AOMs in relation to an always submerged system that uses bubblers to keep a minimum 5ppm DO how much can the AOMs use at their peak conversion rate   and    explain why the peak 02 consumption by AOMs is bottlenecked by 02 when it is at 5ppm."

aquaponics,2natvl,Sycosys,3,Mon Nov 24 22:51:41 2014 UTC,I believe some larger hydroponic greenhouses use bees as pollinators. You still keep the bees outside but let them in a couple times per day. Not sure how it works in the winter.

aquaponics,2natvl,Einherjar_Underhill,1 point,Fri Mar 27 03:01:09 2015 UTC,"Back in my insect behaviour class I had learned that bumblebees are commonly used in greenhouses. They have much smaller population sizes than a successful honeybee colony and are well suited to greenhouse life (humidity + no wind).   As for doing this on your own year round... I'm not quite sure about that.  Edit: they produce a lot less honey, as the colony dies off each year and the fertilized queens restart each spring."
aquaponics,2natvl,MilkCurds,1 point,Wed Nov 26 19:39:02 2014 UTC,I'm new to aquaponics but I am a hobby beekeeper and the bees would not have enough food to survive unless you had a massive system.

This of course means you'd be outside, though could set one up indoor as your comparison maybe. Like maybe compare water loss rates with flood and drain against dwc or not techniques. Maybe partially burying the fish tank.. Does a venturi increase water loss due to increased agitation? There is a ton of basic research that can be done while you're still learning the systems and how to use them.

aquaponics,2n84hr,Taranathicus,1 point,Mon Nov 24 02:47:36 2014 UTC,"I know next to nothing on the finer details of DWC.  That said media to DWC make's a lot of sense as deep water culture roots cannot handle too much slime/sediment.  More advanced setups I've seen have FT -> filter -> grow bed -> filter -> DWC -> SUMP ( google for CHIFT or CHOP-2 ) to ensure the DWC roots stay healthy.   Do I need filters? Once you get above 20g, having sediment filters is a smart idea.   Two popular options are: Radial flow & Swirl filters Good example w/diagrams here http://www.aquaponicsdesignsdiy.com/2-low-cost-aquaponics-filter-design/  Which is better? That's a borderline religious type question, for me I like radial.  For a 75g system, you can use a 5 gallon bucket to make a filter and call it good.   via t5/t8's.   You may be hard pressed to find t-8's almost anywhere ( I go to a lot of hydro stores in my area - Colorado ) and I cannot recall ever seeing t-8's this or last year.  t-5's are slightly more energy efficient, slightly cooler, and depending on who you ask have a longer operating life span.   I want to start with goldfish and then go to something I might eat later on down the road.   I love gold fish, they're awesome in AP, just keep in mind that they're dirty, they can grow fairly big/fast, and they will kill whatever they can ( eg ghost shrimp, similar sized fish, each other ).     The lights and pumps will be controlled via an arduino and I will be logging temperature, light levels, humidity, maybe something for water quality/ph   Very cool idea for data logging, constant PH monitoring in AP will be difficult because of the sediment/poop floating around along with not being cheap ( if something is priced too good to be true, it likely is ).  As for arduino programming, it's easy to create a memory leak in c that might take days to develop.  Sometime this year I remember another AP operating had a memory leak that eventually locked the entire chip up ( including the heart beat logic )... side effect was partial failure of their AP system.   f I have an arduino controller would it be worth bypassing a bell syphon and going for timing the pump?   Shutting the pump off at the end of the day can save some heat and a fractional amount of power.  If you have sufficient air pumps to keep the water aerated, putting your pump on a timer at minimum would work well.  I'd rather rely on a $14-17 digital timer then something I wrote for my arduino ( at least without extensive testing ).  As for bell syphons, they are robust and simple systems.  I've not had one fail yet and I don't hear/see many reports of them catastrophically failing"
aquaponics,2n84hr,zynix,0,Mon Nov 24 12:22:27 2014 UTC,"pumps are usually rather low wattage items.. I think my big pump for my outdoor AP system is 45-55 watts.   My indoor pump might be 25.   Contrast that with my indoor lighting which current soaks up about 600W  My indoor system is based around a 55 gallon tank.   I run Tank -> GrowBed -> Sump -> Filter -> Tank. I drain into the grow bed via a overflow siphon. My grow bed is not completely filled with grow media, I instead use the bucket method, with my plants in buckets. this makes it easy to maintain the bell siphon which drains the grow bed. My sump acts as a solids filter and my old aquarium filter handles the rest of the junk in the water.   I clean my aquarium filter once a month or so, I suck solids out of the sump after each grow/harvest cycle."

Essentially stratified media in a porous bucket that you put into the grow bed. Fill the bucket with 2/3 hydroton, a sheet of burlap, 1/3 soil mixture. Then determine volume of water that will soak the top layer, but not reach the bottom (hydroton) layer. Put the bucket into the media bed as deep as the level of hydroton inside the bucket. Now that you have the volume of water for the top, you can add whatever you need without it reaching the fish's water, and still get the benefits of the fish water. A guy named Vlad Jovanovich came up with the idea. Pretty clever. I have yet to try this myself but I'm setting up some buckets for tomatoes and one for a dwarf pear tree.  Like /u/Sycosys said if you add a bunch of potash and/or bone meal it will raise your pH which you may not want. Check your pH and make sure you aren't already in a nutrient lockout with the berries.

My tilapia dont seem to give a half of a damn about a little potassium/phosphorus.   I like to maintain my ph using a mix. When my ph dips below 6 i add a tablespoon or so of my mix and that bumps it back to my preferred 6.5.   I Definitely need to caution people from just adding stuff to their water.

aquaponics,2mxz5v,pounce,3,Fri Nov 21 02:29:43 2014 UTC,"Most of the time you don't, because most of these systems are not capable of handling a treatment. If the fish system and plant system are not capable of being operated independently f each other, you are very limited on treatments. A lot of the treatment for fish is detrimental to the plants and vice versa.   It might be worth pulling that individual fish out and putting him in a separate aquarium and medicating it there. That way there is no concern over contamination. It helps having a sick fish in a separate tank because it is easier to observe and manage water quality. Take a look at this chart and see what symptom best matches the issue.  If you look at the MSDS for each item: Melafix- cajeput oil (tea tree oil) Pimafix - bay oil Stress Coat - aloe and sodium thiosulfate  Stress coat is unlikely to solve your problem. Melafix and Pimafix would probably be ok in an AP system, but a lot of the other medications are stronger and something like malachite is not safe to use.  The best way to handle disease/illness in the future is to avoid it. Setting up a small quarantine tank before introducing new fish will save head and money down the road."

aquaponics,2mxz5v,PotentPonics,2,Fri Nov 21 12:25:30 2014 UTC,"Generally speaking, fish illness is a water quality issue.  Sounds like you are running your nutes too high.  If you don't treat the underlying issue, treating the fish is a fool's errand."
aquaponics,2mxz5v,SpongeReef,-1,Fri Nov 21 19:38:01 2014 UTC,This is wrong. Most fish health issues are temperature or PH related which then compromised the fishes immune system. The other major cause is introduction of unclean new fish. About 95% of your issues is caused by those 3. While you can harm your fish with high nutrients you need to run them so high that your plants will show some kind of lock out before hand in almost every case.
aquaponics,2mxz5v,PotentPonics,0,Fri Nov 21 20:38:45 2014 UTC,"Massively incorrect.  You AP people seriously need to work on your husbandry.  Fish issues are almost ALL related to stress.  Please explain how a temperature drop or PH change can directly impact the immune system of ANY animal.  It is stress that causes the problem.  Same with running systems with high nitrates, nitrites, phosphates and ammonia.  That causes stress which IS directly linked to illness in fish.  PH and temperature swings are at the bottom of the barrel of possible causes.  Possible, but very very very unlikely.  I don't know who told you that, but you need to get a new source of information.     hile you can harm your fish with high nutrients you need to run them so high that your plants will show some kind of lock out before hand in almost every case.     Wow.  Utterly wrong.  Plants can handle FAR higher nutrients than any fish.  In fact they are preferential to Ammonia and Nitrite and will happily live in levels that will kill any fish out there.  Do you seriously think that AP is the first time people have grown emergent plants in an aquarium?  Give your head a shake.    Sorry there buddy, just because you want to rationalize running your system with high nutrients and basically torturing your fish until they die that doesn't mean that it is the correct way to do things.  People have been keeping fish for thousands of years and AP changes nothing about basic husbandry.  High nutrients causes stress, stress causes illness.  No, your plants will not show signs of shock before your fish die.  While introduction of new fish can EXPOSE your fish to illness, it is the stress of having a shitty environment to live in that causes them to sucumb to it.    You need to read up and learn your shit there bro.  Pretty much nothing you have said there is correct."
aquaponics,2mxz5v,SpongeReef,0,Fri Nov 21 23:34:11 2014 UTC,"And here is info on why PH swings are dangerous  http://www.fishchannel.com/fish-exclusives/fama/aquarium-ph.aspx  All in all, I think pH is an important value even for freshwater hobbyists like you. A reliable pH test kit or electronic probe is an important piece of equipment for all aquarists. I recommend testing pH on a weekly basis just to make sure no sudden swing has taken place and so the hobbyist has a frame of reference about their aquarium’s normal pH. Sudden pH swings can stress tropical fish causing a lack in immunities, parasitic outbreaks, bacterial infections and more. In some species too drastic a swing can cause a quick death."
aquaponics,2mxz5v,PotentPonics,1 point,Sat Nov 22 03:29:36 2014 UTC,"And here is info on why PH swings are dangerous http://www.fishchannel.com/fish-exclusives/fama/aquarium-ph.aspx     You really are taking the wrong thing away from that page.  The important thing in that pasted quote is this: Sudden pH swings can stress tropical fish.  The rest of that sentence is describing the effects of stress, not the effects of a PH swing.  Here is a good article on the causes of stress by Doctors Foster and Smith.  PH is on that list, but you will notice it is talking about PH being incorrect for that particular species not about a temporary swing.  Here is a good quote:     chronic stress will also lower the ability of the immune system to respond effectively and fully. This lowered immune response is what allows parasites, bacteria, and fungi to infect a stressed fish and cause disease and death   PH is an interesting value.  Some species in freshwater require very specific PH values for peak condition.  Those are not going to regularly be fish kept in an AP system.  PH doesn't swing for no reason and if it does, it is unlikely to be the thing that causes a problem. A  sudden drop generally means an increase in CO2 production, often caused by something rotting which is going to increase ammonia, nitrite, nitrate and generally cause problems with nutrients which cause stress in the fish.      By far the most common issue is nutrients values being far far to high.  Bad water is the issue.  With AP you still want to balance nutrient uptake/export with nutrient production.  You still want that number to balance as close to 0 as you can get it without affecting plant growth.  At least if you want healthy and happy fish.  A stable nutrient level means a balanced tank and that is the very very first goal of any new fish keeper.  With AP systems you have it easy as you don't have to overcome carbon limitation.  High nutrient water causes stress.  Stress makes fish susceptible to illness.  It really is that simple."
aquaponics,2mxz5v,SpongeReef,1 point,Sat Nov 22 04:05:49 2014 UTC,"The bigger issue is lockout. Nitrates above 80 effects your phosphate uptake for example and so on. Stress or not it effects the fishs ability to maintain proper health, most outbreaks can be attributed to temperature or PH as the root cause. Every now and then some one will run nitrates way to high but again you will see it in the plants as well and its almost never the reason for a single fish getting sick that I have ever seen. Stress as a result of PH or temp swing is still a result of PH or temp swing being the cause of the issue in the first place so IDK what it is you disagree with?"
aquaponics,2mxz5v,PotentPonics,1 point,Sat Nov 22 04:51:07 2014 UTC,"For most commonly kept species a nitrate level of 80 will be fatal. The absolute max that has been settled for freshwater is about 50.  In reality you want a ceiling of about 20 so that you have some buffer to play with should something die.  That is still excessively high and will cause stress to the fish. Worse, the smell would be enough to knock a horse dead at those levels.    PH doesn't swing for no reason.  There is a cause of the swing and you need to nail that down.  There is the reason for your stress.  The PH swing is a symptom, not a cause.  If you notice a sudden PH drop, then you need to start looking for something dead in the tank not correcting your PH issue.    Anyhow, if you haven't seen illness caused by high nutrients you haven't been doing this very long.  By FAR it is the most common cause of issues.  If you are running above 50ppm nitrate then the PH swing or temp swing was just the straw that broke the camel's back. The fish weren't in good condition in the first place and were already stressed and susceptible to any small thing that happens in the tank.    I keep rare and expensive fish.  Water quality is the single most important issue when it comes to keeping a fish alive and healthy and I can pretty much guarantee that I am more concerned with PH than practically any AP owner.  As close to zero nutrients as humanly possible is ideal.  I realize that you aren't keeping the same kinds of animals so I don't expect AP folks to keep the same strict controls on nutrients, but that is no excuse for anyone to be running sky high nutes and providing a substandard environment for their fish.  AP is still husbandry and all exotic animal owners (yes, tropical fish are exotics) have a responsibility to provide the best possible environment for the animal.  In all reality, unless you are planning on eating the fish (a topic for a whole nother rant.  Please don't eat your aquarium fish.  VERY unhealthy to do for 90% of keepers) they aren't even necessary to the system.  The bio filter will quite happily continue to kick out nutrients without any fish in there at all as long as you provide it with food.  When anyone cares for an intelligent feeling animal, the animal's needs come before that of the plants."
aquaponics,2mxz5v,SpongeReef,-6,Sat Nov 22 05:21:54 2014 UTC,"No 80 is not remotely close to lethal. You need to go over to r/plantedaquarium and learn a lot more about fish and invertebrate nutrient tolerance. Most planted aquariums which house small shrimp which are way more sensitive than fish can easily survive 80 nitrates and 2 phosphate. In salt water sure your right on your values above 5 nitrates would be cause for alarm but in fresh water nitrates can be as high as 120 in a lake or pond in nature crap I'v had customers tap water test at 80 out of the tap!, and fish do not die. I have personally witnessed fish well over 200 nitrates survive with out much harm. Not saying that's a good thing but 80 is not even remotely close to lethal. Again its about ratios and keeping things below there lockout levels and you'l be fine. The fish aren't as sensitive as you have previously told. Aside from all of that the aquaculture world also has a ton of data on allowable nutrient levels and they run well above what most AP systems do and they farm fish. So I'd love to know where you are getting your very very low numbers from because I couldn't disagree more."

Go make a post on /r/plantedtank saying you are running your system at 80ppm and you think it is just fine.  Go and see what happens.  Post on /r/aquariums so the rest of the aquarium crowd can see exactly how bad AP owners can actually get.     Most planted aquariums which house small shrimp which are way more sensitive than fish can easily survive 80 nitrates and 2 phosphate     No, they can't.  If we hear someone talk about 20ppm nitrates we tell them to do a water change.  No shrimp will live in 80ppm nitrates and 2ppm phosphates.    Seriously there buddy.  You need to educate yourself.  No one is running levels such as you are suggesting.  No one in the hobby thinks that is acceptable in even the slightest.  As I said.  You are rationalizing cruelty to animals so that YOU can get high. Personally I think you should be reported to the police for animal cruelty.    The reason your fish die due to a minor PH or Temperature swing is that they are being kept in horrific conditions, barely alive and not healthy at all.  You should not be keeping fish or any other animal if those are the conditions you think are acceptable.    EDIT: I just submitted your post to /r/plantedtank and /r/aquariums"
aquaponics,2mxz5v,totes_meta_bot,0,Sat Nov 22 17:42:19 2014 UTC,No I'm not suggesting running them at 80 to 160 I would suggest running them at 40 - 80 but not 160 long term no. 160 you might stop feeding for a few days and let your rates do down but its still not at panic level. My point about nitrate levels being as high as 160 is that it wasn't lethal short term. Most fish will survive even 300 ppm short term. I have seen fish survive a system that had to be over 500 ppm. They were hurting for sure but not dead. Again I have been keeping exotic fish far more fragile than tilapia for years I'm more than happy to agree to disagree but to say that 80 is lethal is factually wrong. I am currently breeding freshwater pipefish in my main planted tank which is one of the harder freshwater fish not only to keep but to breed and raise. AP is a living system with active nutrient export there's a huge difference. I get that your an aquarium guy I was raised to be taught the same levels you were. Then I got experience with both aquariums and AP for over a dozen years and learned other wise first hand. I hear ya but we are growing plants and fish. That goes with out saying half the country would half to filter there tap water to get the levels you suggesting which again has been proven other wise in multiple industrys as well as many members of this community. For example aquaculture uses 100 nitrates as its threshold for most fish species as a max recommended level. That's an industry standard. We shal agree to disagree but I am not sure what more I can do to show you what I have learned through experience.

Heres some knowledge for ya. http://www.peteducation.com/article.cfm?c=16+2154&aid=3316  Temperature can be the single most important environmental factor in the life of your fish. Fish, in the wild and in our aquariums, are very sensitive to changes in temperature and a sudden shift can severely affect their immune systems.  A major component of temperature control is your heating unit. Choose your heater based on the size of your aquarium, using 3-5 watts per gallon as a guide. Each heater can only raise the temperature of the aquarium a certain number of degrees. If the ambient temperature of the aquarium's room is colder than normal, 3-5 watts per gallon may not be sufficient to maintain the temperature your fish need.  Since house temperatures in the spring and fall vary so much, this is when we commonly see more cases of ich or other diseases caused by a compromised immune system. When fall comes, an easy solution is to turn your aquarium heater down no more than one degree per day as temperatures cool. This is when a quality heater will really help you, since 'value heaters' may cause the temperature to drop more than one degree per day, causing unwanted stress."
aquaponics,2mxz5v,PotentPonics,2,Sat Nov 22 03:21:19 2014 UTC,"You really need to actually read what you are referencing before posting it.  What they are talking about is stress.  Temperature is not directly linked to illness, stress is.  Now, lets go and look at another Dr. Fosters and Smith Article shall we:    http://www.liveaquaria.com/PIC/article.cfm?aid=88    Notice the causes of stress?  The VERY first two: Elevated Ammonia, Elevated Nitrate.  Fluctuations in temperature most certainly cause stress, but it isn't the fluctuation itself that is linked to the illness.    Bad water is caused by having a high nutrient load.  High nutrient loads cause stress.  Stress causes illness.  In almost all beginner systems (and judging by the references you are pulling out you are a beginner) the issue is going to almost always be nutrients.  In an AP system it is practically exclusively excessively high nutrients.    Look, I know you love your plants and want dank nugs, but you are hurting your fish in your quest to rationalize nutrient levels that are excessive and harmful.  Ballance, try to achieve balance.  A nitrate level of 5ppm that never rises or lowers.  That is your goal.  You want to balance nutrient input and output so that you aren't adding in more nutrients than your plants are taking out.  Same with phosphates.  Balanced levels that don't rise or lower over time is what you need to be shooting for and as near 0 as you can get it without affecting plant growth."
aquaponics,2mxz5v,SpongeReef,0,Sat Nov 22 04:12:31 2014 UTC,I know you think I run high nutes in my water because I grow cannabis but I don't. We have a different way of supplementing needed nutes. While I run higher cal and mag than your average AP person that's the only thing I do different with the water chemistry aside from keeping my phosphate maybe slightly higher than an average system I do most of my supplementing via a soil layer. The more important thing at least with cannabis is keeping your nitrate to phosphate ratio right so you get proper node and flower growth but that's a whole other discussion. The more you know.  What is your definition of HIGH nutrients exactly?
aquaponics,2mxz5v,skuba,2,Sat Nov 22 04:54:46 2014 UTC,"I was just about to ask you that.  What you consider ""high"" and what I consider ""high"" are almost certainly going to be vastly different.  Personally, with an AP system I would be shooting for 5ppm nitrates and maybe say 0.1ppm phosphates.  To be clear, that is many many times the levels that I keep my systems at and really would only go that high because I was running AP.  My systems stay at around 0.5ppm nitrate and 0.002 phosphate.  High would be above 20ppm.  At that point you need to start taking emergency measures to maintain the health of your fish.    I have found that many AP owners try to rationalize excessively high nutrient levels as being okay for the fish.  They aren't and it isn't.  It seems there is a real disconnect in AP with what is happening and why.  I have heard AP system owners justify stocking levels that are simply cruel running nutrient levels that are horrific.  Bad water, bad conditions, fish with no where to hide in big bare empty tanks.  A recipe for stress and sick fish.  The concept of balance seems to be something that has been slow to take up in AP circles.  Mostly, I think, because AP folks are more into plants and the fish are a secondary consideration.  People don't actually seem to understand the place of fish in AP or what is happening to produce the nutrients that their plants require.  Because of that they justify conditions that aquarists moved on from decades ago after they realized how horrible it is for the fish."

aquaponics,2mpfd9,TrapperJon,3,Wed Nov 19 03:19:52 2014 UTC,"Well for the initial stages of cycling a tank, you can use just unscented cleaning ammonia (about a capful every 50 or so gallons, though people everywhere have opinions on the amount, that's just what I have experience using). It simulates biological load.   You can seed the tank with the little nitrobactor packets from the fish store, but honestly I have done this in typical aquariums without the packets and it just takes a couple weeks longer, because the initial concentration of bacterial is low.   But if you provide food (ammonia) the bacteria will come.   Since the ammonia amount is just one concentrated start, you need to monitor the NO2 and NO3 levels that would normally balance based on fish bio load. So as the nitrites spike, you need to continue to provide an adequate amount of ammonia. Some people don't add ammonia after the initial set up but I found keeping the high bio load constant you can provide a buffer of beneficial bacteria when you dump a giant amount of fish.   The bacteria in my case would have gone totally dormant because of the temperature but the ammonia doesn't disappear. Again, my half ass behavior on this project is evident... I wasn't going to add fish/plants till spring anyway, just screwing around :)"

aquaponics,2mpfd9,limowrecks,1 point,Tue Nov 18 22:54:27 2014 UTC,"No heater, honestly I wasn't thinking. So a 300w heater helps? I should try it, i have a spare aquarium heater I could throw in there, and see what happens, it couldn't get much worse than solid ice. HA"
aquaponics,2mpfd9,hjras,2,Tue Nov 18 22:58:14 2014 UTC,"well, so far its gotten to about -8 Celcius (17f) here, and no problems yet.  Water is still cold but not frozen or near frozen, alas winter is not here yet.  Also, the faster the water is moving the more friction it causes in the sytem also keeping the ice a bit at bay.   The water heater i bought was about 2 feet long and around 45.00.   Since I dont use edible fish as I am allergic I have cold water fish, feeder golds and  koi."

When I first met him I thought he was a troll, but as I've gotten to know him I've come to realize he actually knows a lot, has been around the block, and provides a useful service to the AP world.  When you mix idealism with the potential to make money - as aquaponics does - you can get a weird soup of cheats, shysters, and ignorant people with hearts and egos bigger than their brains, that get a lot of press and attention because they're ""feeding the hungry"" and ""building a more sustainable world.""    It's true that some are.  But there's a lot of government and charity money being spent on it that could do more good elsewhere.    There are also a lot of balloons that need popped, and AH does that as well as anyone."

The wicking buckets and the long wicking bed at the back are based on a mix of Rob Bob's work and Brett Prochard's self-watering gardens.

He eats a lot of algae so I don't think he needs a second feeding. He's lived happily in an aquaponics setup I found online at Japan aquaponics. Mostly IKEA parts and a pump I found on amazon.

(you haven't seemingly been running your systems long enough to grow out to sexual maturity from what you've posted)  Regardless, for most freshwater species.. it's not usual for them to spawn in tanks naturally"
aquaponics,2mlsgs,Ramiller14,3,Mon Nov 17 22:39:03 2014 UTC,"Bluegill would be a good choice.  They are cold hardy, disease resistant and very good eating."
aquaponics,2mlsgs,2muchfuncankillya,2,Tue Nov 18 21:35:41 2014 UTC,"Also, how many of the fish could I fit in the 250 gallon tank?   Dr. Storey talks about a major factor in determining fish stocking.  http://brightagrotech.com/biological-surface-area-in-aquaponics/  Possibly much more involved is Dr. Wilson's excel spreadsheets of doom ( http://www.aquaponic.com.au/calculators.htm )  I'm still working on understanding what's involved.  And there is SRAC 454 ( read this, I've gone to aquaponic talk/presentations where multiple people just re-present this document and cite this as the source of their presentation ).     Which fish is best?   At low temperatures, trout works well.  Just keep in mind that they start to die when the temperature goes above 60F ( so check something like www.wunderground.com to see how long you have in a growing season, trout take 6-7 months ).  Another SRAC provides a lot of important facts about raising trout in aquaculture - http://fisheries.tamu.edu/files/2013/09/SRAC-Publication-No.-223-Trout-Production-Feeds-and-Feeding-Methods.pdf  Finally, if this is your first aquaponic system and you have not bought the parts yet, hold off and build a small system ( 20-30 gallons ) first as there are a lot of things you can't get from a book and it would take way too long to explain.  It's one thing to murder an entire school of .10 goldfish and another to wipe out $.75-2 a piece of food fish ( price depending on how far along the nursery has raised them )."
aquaponics,2mlsgs,zynix,5,Tue Nov 18 00:11:25 2014 UTC,"spreadsheets of doom! hahaha I really liked that term.   I am an aquaculture engineer and I work designing more commercial stuff.. what I don't like about that spreadsheet is that it assumes 60g of feed per per kilo of feed a day when this ratio is recommended for raft aquaponics, not gravel ones. There are other component ratios for gravel media.   In any case, I might be going a bit too technical but if accurate answers are needed a proper mass balance approach will provide most of the design outputs."
aquaponics,2mlsgs,Pastelitomaracucho,1 point,Tue Nov 18 08:37:26 2014 UTC,Can you suggest where one might start to get educated on proper mass balance?  Are there good textbooks out there?

aquaponics,2mlsgs,Pastelitomaracucho,1 point,Tue Nov 18 01:02:35 2014 UTC,"As others have said:   1) Catfish: they still feed at temperatures around 50 and lower. I think about fried catfish and my stomach grumbles.  2) Carps: i love these fish. Gentle, curious and resilient.   3) Trout: voracious feeders, need good oxygen levels and overall better water quality, they are very sensitive to ammonia and nitrite..  4) Yellow perch: in my opinion, complete assholes. Grow very slow and are cannibalistic. To me, its just a niche market species that should be left for people who really have the chance to make some money out of it.   5) what about artic charr?: I tried it once, blew my mind. They love being crowded...   How many fish can you sustain in your tank is matter of species and how large your plant component, flows and general filtration systems will be. Can you give more info about the size of the growing beds and so on?"
aquaponics,2mlsgs,Pastelitomaracucho,1 point,Tue Nov 18 08:46:55 2014 UTC,"Thanks for the info, I will be able to give full measurements and temp info tomorrow when I go back. Another question: I've heard that carps are no good for eating, is that true?"

aquaponics,2mlsgs,zynix,1 point,Tue Nov 18 00:14:52 2014 UTC,"eh some 4 inchers would do.. and they can get pretty dang big in a large tank if you give them long enough.   As for the cold snap.. on the night it hit -14 at DIA my hoophouse dipped to about 28-30 for a few hours while i was asleep.. My tomatoes froze and are done. The celery, onions, strawberries, thyme and rosemary are all quite happy.. a few other herbs may have gone dormant.. not sure.   now that it is out of the negatives and singles and back into the teens and soon twenties it has been no problem to keep it above freezing at night, usually in the high 30s/low 40s  I do have to add a fresh 5 gallons of water to the thermal mass every few days as the rocket stove exhaust steams it out after a few long burns."
aquaponics,2mlsgs,Sycosys,1 point,Tue Nov 18 00:19:56 2014 UTC,"28-30   In grand scheme of things that is not bad at all... sure it's below freezing but also got to factor in that you have, effectively, a heated trash bag with plants in your backyard."
aquaponics,2mlsgs,zynix,0,Tue Nov 18 00:40:23 2014 UTC,"Lmao, true enough   effectively, a heated trash bag with plants in your backyard.   an interesting insulation that i did not consider was the thick layer of internal frost which formed the really cold nights.. it easily grew to be ~1/4 thick."

aquaponics,2mjpzc,2muchfuncankillya,2,Mon Nov 17 19:36:20 2014 UTC,"I've used these kinds of pumps.  Also external pumps.  Both work fine, depending on your situation.  Don't let external pumps get wet though.  For all of them, if you leave the foam filters in place they get clogged.  If you take the foam filters out you have to be careful not to let any small sticks or other solid items get in there or they can screw them up."
aquaponics,2mjpzc,FrostyFish,2,Mon Nov 17 20:22:49 2014 UTC,"Depending on the application, the sponge can stay in or be removed.  I usually remove the sponge in outdoor aquaponics systems and just let the cover protect the pump from sucking up ""sticks"".  The cover acts as an inlet screen and works well.  A filter bag can be used too but they will need cleaning a couple of times a year.  Small mag style pumps like the ones with blue covers in the link above are hard to beat for smaller backyard systems."

Yes a micro-aquaponic system is kind of touchey but after a while the bacteria in the bed gets a whole hell of a lot more developed and helps stabilize things out.  Also the smaller systems and being touchey is great because it teaches you about all of the things that can go wrong very quickly and with minimal costs.  Furthermore, a 2x2' aquaponic system can pack a serious punch as you can grow plants insanely close together with your only limitation being the light penetrating past the top layer of leafs.  That's part of the reason why I've been abandoning major plots of radishes ( I keep ~15 spaced 2 weeks apart so I can eat a couple each week ) and planting spinach more heavily as I can grow a lot of spinach practically on top of each other."

aquaponics,2maxhy,PotentPonics,1 point,Fri Nov 14 19:00:43 2014 UTC,Are they white LEDs or are they the colored ones?
aquaponics,2maxhy,PotentPonics,2,Fri Nov 14 19:28:24 2014 UTC,Color depends on what you want to grow. Ufos were designed for flowering cannabis so they are heavyer in the red end of the spectrum which is a little more important for flowering. They should grow most veggies just fine. Ufos are also a lower end LED and you will have to keep them fairly close to your plants to make full use of them because they are a lower wattage fixture.
aquaponics,2maxhy,The_Other_Tbo,1 point,Fri Nov 14 19:32:53 2014 UTC,Thanks very much for the reply.    The shop owner said to keep the lights nearly brushing the tops of the plants for the very reason you had mentioned (they aren't the greatest quality).
aquaponics,2maxhy,zynix,0,Fri Nov 14 19:58:23 2014 UTC,Yep :) You really need a minimum of 3 watts per diode for terrestrial plants and IDEALLY 5w diodes. I'v been building LEDS now for over 8 years and have tested a TON of different kinds as well as built alot of my own fixtures. The key to LEDs is minimum wattage per diode and covering the light spectrum you want to match with your diode choices.

The two things that grew from seed in the grow bed for me are beans and wheat seed. Both are growing like crazy!!  I have a pineapple top and cuttings from a basil and tomato plant in there as an experiment. Still waiting to see if they'll grow or rot. Not sure if the pineapple is going to make it. Basil looks good, though. I think the tomato is growing, too. All I did was cut a branch off of our outdoor tomato plant, stripped a couple inches on the bottom and stuck it in.

Nice thing about that graphing library is the dual vertical axis ( KH, nitrates, and Fahrenheit on left; everything else on right ) as the API tests are on different orders of magnitude.  Also you can do basic data entry via an android phone using the Google spreadsheet app.  Otherwise, some stuff just doesn't like AP environments ( I suspect celery and media beds are not friends ) BUT other factors include temperature and a brief 2-4 day short watering of where you put the seeds down.  If setup correctly, there's supposed to be 2"" of dry material and if you bury seeds down enough to germinate, that might be too far down for them."

aquaponics,2m7cex,projectstew,1 point,Thu Nov 13 20:10:23 2014 UTC,"Well, it is chilly now, so it is artificial and natural.  I put mylar and that shiny stuff around most of it but left the top halfs of the green house open (clear poly) so it gets natural light as well. I do artificial, as well, for heat.  It will be an interesting winter as that is my goal..year round fruit and veggie picking.     But come spring it is all natural.  Maybe against the wall I will add grape trellis all the way down the edge and grow grapes too.  There are some strawberries down below too, very green spread nicely.    Word to the wise, don't be scared of jamming a bunch  veggies in as aquaponics allows the plants to fight LESS for resources as they are constantly getting them.   I am testing something with some purple onions.   I put the all ON TOP of my clay and stone so the roots point down.  I put some coconut husk mats on top of them and poked the green onion stem through.  Want to see how big they will get without having to jam them into the medium.  Ill take some pictures.    I went into this project eyes wide open.   Researched, read, loved everything everyone did.   But I am a curious mother fucker.  This led me to my mineral discovery in which I think EVERYONE should research.  Both LIME and EPSOM salts.  Literally two weeks after I added epsom salts my tomatoes lost all their rot, and grew super fast.  They were stuck and not growing.  After a month I added lime - dolomite.  I did some research,  and found that the fish love the lime, good for their bones, algae, microorganisms..all benefits, I see no drawbacks yet.   As well, it absorbs CO2 in the water promoting better oxygen diffusion in the water.  Lime link   More lime info .  I am not a botanist so I suggest some research on the levels of lime.  My fish are thriving and happy.   So that is some of my experiences imparted on the the rest of you.  Happy Aquaponicing :)  Oh, and thank you !  Edit:  For bug control I am experimenting with Epsom salt/Lime water in a spray bottle.  Lets see what happens!"

aquaponics,2m1bz3,MilkCurds,2,Wed Nov 12 03:21:08 2014 UTC,"A while back I looked at doing a barrel ponic system and changed my mind.  This was a document from my growing library that I liked - http://www.aces.edu/dept/fisheries/education/documents/barrel-ponics.pdf  Not mentioned here but some additional facts to consider for building:  Water weighs 8lbs to a gallon.  Standard quality leca ( light expanded clay aggregate aka hydroton ) takes up 40-60% volume of a container.  So if you feel fill a 20 gallon space with leca, roughly a third of that will be water when it reaches max height.  Give or take that's 6 gallons which makes 48 pounds of weight add in the weight of the media soaking wet and it goes up to about 60 lbs.  I bring up the weight because its important to use screws ( vs nails ) whenever possible.  I did a test this summer with a 100 gallon bed made out of scrap wood and polyurethane sheeting ( I expected it to disintegrate/fail, as that wasn't a relevant concern for the test ).  After roughly 3000 ( 4xhour * 30 days ) flood & drain cycles, part of the system failed as it had worked the nails out.  Use appropriate sized deck screws or better self drilling ( cause who has the time to make 4 - 5 pilot holes per section ).  Also plan for leaks and if you can find it, some plastic container lids or plastic.  The water coming from a healthy AP system has a lot of crap ( literally ) in it.  Last suggestion, don't take the barrel ponic document design as gospel.  Measure out your barrel halves and adjust lengths and dimensions via a pencil & paper drawing.  It makes life a lot easier to be able to have those notes because it puts the design in your head and when you screw up ( who gets anything right on first try? ) its a good place to reference."

aquaponics,2lvn6t,PotentPonics,3,Mon Nov 10 18:01:28 2014 UTC,How would mm fare in an AP system. Any better than soil or hydro?
aquaponics,2lvn6t,WonkoTheSane__,0,Mon Nov 10 21:13:29 2014 UTC,"So it will go as fast or faster as hydro with incredibly good flavor like an outdoor soil grown would. In a properly planted AP setup you plant has access to soil bacteria and aquatic bacteria which is twice the amount of any other growing method out there. Any good organic grower knows the importance of a healthy microbial environment. This translates into better mineral intake and much much better flavor and strength with less water and fertilizer used than any other method for equal yields. It also gives you the most possible inputs that can be changed to adjust values in the plants as they grow. I can dose soil, the water or familiar spray depending on the nutrient I need to boost. Its all about maximizing the bacteria biodiversity in your plants root system."
aquaponics,2lvn6t,WonkoTheSane__,4,Mon Nov 10 22:13:25 2014 UTC,Thank you. I learn something new everyday
aquaponics,2lvn6t,smokeysmokerson,0,Mon Nov 10 22:30:34 2014 UTC,Most strains grow as fast or faster in AP than hydro during veg and up to 3 weeks faster in flower depending on the strain when run against a clone from teh same mother in hydro and WAY faster than soil. Any one whos smoked good outdoor knows you cant even remotely compare hydro taste to good organic soil grown its not even close. Bacteria biodiversity and there nutrient break down is what plants evolved to use and what makes for good flavor. You can grow plants in hydro sure but the flavor isn't remotely close. Also hydro gives my headaches too many people can't flush right I'd much rather have a lower over head cost same yield and better flavor. Hydro also uses WAY more money per harvest because  you dump your nutrients and water all the time. Hydros ok but its far from perfect.
aquaponics,2lvn6t,goltoof,2,Mon Nov 10 23:26:08 2014 UTC,"Adding compost tea to a hydro system doesn't do anything because most hydro nutrients are anti microbial by default to prevent line clogs. You kill your bacteria that you are trying to feed with your tea. Bacteria biodiversity translates into better nutrient diversity and input, nothing puts nutrients into a plant quicker than bacteria everyone, knows that. So by having as many species as you can you get as many nutrients as you can organically into your plant per day. Even in an organic hydro your still only using aquatic bacteria. We are using both aquatic and terrestrial species. You properly feed and maintain both you'll get amazing results. We will have some documented grows posting soon of other plants than the ones we shot back in spring for our pics when high times talked to us which is when most of the pics in the post are from. I guess your just a hydro person tho best of luck to ya."
aquaponics,2lvn6t,FUCKDUCKBOAT,2,Tue Nov 11 00:24:46 2014 UTC,"Wow buddy,  seriously,  you are the one that needs to do some reading.  Traditional hydro is inherently ""anti-bacterial"" as you are basically trying to grow in a neutral medium,  keeping all bacteria at bay.  Try running your hydro a little too warm, without h2o2 or bleach or anything else to keep it in check.  As for ""tastes have nothing to do with bacteria bio-diversity"" of course terpenes provide the taste and smell.    I guess terpenes turn out exactly the same every time right?  Hint: they don't,  and bacterial biodiversity is exactly what's going to make them differ.   You may not see variation because you hydro recipie is the same everytime (doesn't mean i t couldn't be better!)  Adding a bit of tea to a hydro system is basically pissing in the wind.  The tea is there to break down organic matter to extract nutrients for the plants uptake,  but it cannot do that in a hydro system.   As a matter of fact the bacteria in the tea is so out numbered in a hydro system,  basically you are throwing the money away, between the high salt, acidity, ph up/down, h2o2 / bleach, and low temperatures (or any combination thereof)  whatever you spent on tea is gone and gave you basically no benefit as you aren't using the tea as intended at all.  Hydro is great for business,  but not great as a connoisseur.  Yes you can get GREAT bud off hydro,  but the fact of the matter is,  as good as it gets,  the right grower can still grow nicer, tastier bud in an organic setup,  and if you wonder why organic growers think that maybe you should do some more smoking with some, because it's OBVIOUS."

What about people who want to reduce their carbon footprint and successfully use it to sustain themselves and their families, using high output, practical, compact aquaponics systems with minimal maintenance and budget?

aquaponics,2lvcnz,Bright_Agrotech,4,Tue Nov 11 20:34:35 2014 UTC,"Hey Riquun, before you start growing, it's important to do your homework and figure out what you're going to grow. Understanding what your market wants is crucial in farming, just like any other business startup.   What do your local farmer's market customers want?  Where are the gaps in the existing produce market in your town?  If you started growing kale, would people buy it? Or, are there 3 other vendors selling local kale?   Growing aquaponically can be a huge marketing benefit too so don't discount how unique your farm will be compared to others farming using soil. This is exciting stuff and best of luck to you!"
aquaponics,2lvcnz,pounce,2,Tue Nov 11 20:48:07 2014 UTC,Did you have any specific questions?  It's pretty hard to give advice with such an open ended question.  Did you know what fish species or plants you want to grow? Do you know how much you want to grow or how fast you need to turn to market? What area are you in - are you building a greenhouse or is this open air/under shade cloth?
aquaponics,2lvcnz,pounce,1 point,Mon Nov 10 21:48:02 2014 UTC,"I am in no hurry what so ever. I am in southwest missouri for now this will be open air. eventually i will build a greenhouse regardless how my ""business"" works out.  As far as the fish, i know i want to raise tilapia. as far as what i am growing im not sure yet. I know i want to grow ALOT of strawberries (when its time of course) which i will more than likely build a system dedicated to such.  other than that, i havnt looking to market values, saturation or anything like that yet."
aquaponics,2lvcnz,pounce,1 point,Mon Nov 10 23:15:40 2014 UTC,"Tilapia require warm water for growth, and their growth/feeding rate drops drastically once the water temperature drops below 68-70F. Do you think you will be able to maintain water temps above 70F in an outdoor open air system in SW MO? It might be possible to achieve, but you would have a very short growing season without additional heating and some sort of cover.  Are you looking at a tower or NFT setup for the strawberries?  Do you know what type of strawberries you will be producing (i.e. everbearing, june bearing, day neutral)? Are you planing on bringing them to market in the peak of season, or did you want to do an early or late harvest to maximize the price (when supply is low)?"
aquaponics,2lvcnz,FrostyFish,1 point,Tue Nov 11 15:41:10 2014 UTC,"most of that is int he planning stages. and yes water will easily be able to get over 70F. summer time gets over 100 here. lakes around here get to 80F.  NFT setup and everbearing is what i am thinking, but im open. I would like to peak harvest/late harvest"
aquaponics,2lvcnz,hjras,1 point,Tue Nov 11 16:49:43 2014 UTC,"The water temperature should be maintained in the low-mid 80's for best growth. It's not enough that the water temperature will rise about 70F for a few months, the water temperature should always be above 70F if year round production is the goal of the system - or if the goal is to get tilapia to market several times a year. Once the water temperature drops into the 60's, the tilapia will not be feeding and that means decreased nutrients for the strawberries."

The right angle brackets may add enough stability on their own that you won't have to epoxy the whole assembly to the liner."

aquaponics,2ls0u6,hjras,2,Sun Nov 9 17:56:34 2014 UTC,"Ive read something about introducing worms to help break down the waste material.  The worm castings are left over, and I'd imagine are beneficial to the other plants.  Not sure how that affects ph and such.  Also, if you have a filter system it (the castings and dead roots) should filter out?"
aquaponics,2ls0u6,fazuku,4,Sun Nov 9 19:31:44 2014 UTC,"I actually already have red worms in my grow bed(s). Unfortunately I don't have an external mechanical filter, so the grow bed is currently acting also as both mechanical filter and biofilter. This is a design flaw which I'm the first to admit, that while it made the construction easier, limits my maintenance as I will need to remove all the media and likely start over."
aquaponics,2ls0u6,Ta1nted1,2,Sun Nov 9 20:52:17 2014 UTC,"Glad to hear people are using red worms more often. You would be surprised how much they keep plant roots in check. Every time I pull a rootball out, they are inside the ball and I haven't found rot yet."
aquaponics,2ls0u6,zynix,2,Tue Nov 11 20:16:40 2014 UTC,"Also, if you have a filter system it (the castings and dead roots) should filter out?   Can't say with absolute certainty but only with DWC or NFT would dying roots would be swept away ( maybe not in DWC where stuff just settles to the bottom ).  For media beds, dead roots and mud ( crap, food, more crap ) stays roughly where it is and decays/rots until its broken down into nothing.   I can't say with absolute certainty as I keep wiping my systems out after 1-2 harvests to check out somethings I'm testing.  Meanwhile Rob Bob in australia has a 10 minute long video of cleaning mature media beds and its only when he started mixing them up that a whole mess of crap got flushed into the water - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyTtc82VhfI"

aquaponics,2ls0u6,IgorAce,0,Mon Nov 10 13:41:02 2014 UTC,"The plant sheds some amount of its roots that is proportionate to the amount of plant you've removed. The new basil you're seeing is made with nutrients stored in those roots that, after the nutrients are transported, are shed into the system.   Whatever decision you make, you should know this."
aquaponics,2ls0u6,Erinaceous,5,Sun Nov 9 18:42:57 2014 UTC,"I'm pretty sure that's not true. For example perennial rye has a 9 foot root system and the entire plant is cut back annually for hay. The entire plant is cut but the root system remains intact. It's the same with any coppice tree like willow or hazel. According to Elaine Ingham, which is where I learned it, this is just a myth. There might be some die back after cutting but largely the root system remains perfectly intact as long as the plant is healthy."

aquaponics,2lrx2i,Krystal907,1 point,Sun Nov 9 18:40:28 2014 UTC,I was curious because you have guppies so I didn't know if you had an aquarium set up or just a bare tank. If you've got a bare tank you'll have to add driftwood and hidey places for the ancistrus or they will suffer.
aquaponics,2lrx2i,foobastion,1 point,Mon Nov 10 02:54:01 2014 UTC,It's a 100 gallon stock tank filled up to 50 gallons.   The 50 gallon growbed pulls in 15 gallons in a cycle and floods back over a mess of cut up pvc pieces with both the siphon and the fractional return pushing the water in a clockwise direction.   So almost entirely functional with little concern for aesthetics.   Maybe the equivalent of fish limbo/purgatory.
aquaponics,2lrx2i,froschkonig,2,Mon Nov 10 04:25:10 2014 UTC,"I would not choose guppies personally. You may be really limiting your cycle by creating a guppy monoculture. If you are looking for a hardier fish, I recommend tetras or barbs. Barbs are a very energetic fish and they eat and poop quite a bit. Tetras don't eat as much but they get several times larger than guppies and live for up to ten years. I have one of my black skirt tetras still alive from when I purchased him over 8 years ago to cycle my original tank. Tetras will also eat flies, worms, and many other household bugs that are too big for guppies to eat.  There is also no harm in feeding the catfish directly. They are not predators really but more scavengers. Feeding them a normal diet of sinking wafers or pellets can help boost your nitrogen. Catfish can live in fairly poor water conditions too as they can gulp air."
aquaponics,2lrx2i,richcreations,1 point,Sun Nov 9 19:50:54 2014 UTC,"I had planned more so for the guppies to be a supplemental food source for the cat fish.  In the past my attempt to breed tiger barbs was insanely frustrating as they do more than their best to hide eggs and are overall difficult ( at least for me ) to breed.  As for tetra's, I think the sump tank would be too hazardous ( the water moves at a fairly high velocity to make it difficult ( if not impossible ) for the stray fish louse to survive.  Cat fish won out over tilapia due to a morbidly fascinating story[PDF] where someone raised 50 of them in a steel 55 gallon drum.   I would be happy with 20-25 in a system, spread in a 5-10 month growing cycle ( culling 4-5 every other month or 1-2 every other week ).  I might be able to pull off a higher density if I add a second swirl filter to collect more sediment from the pump to sump return line and incorporate a partial drain to wicking bed system."
aquaponics,2lrx2i,billswitz,2,Sun Nov 9 20:25:56 2014 UTC,I have 12 guppies in a 10g and are putting out plenty of nitrates for a couple basil plants. Are you feeding them foods with decent protein content?
aquaponics,2lrx2i,billswitz,1 point,Sun Nov 9 20:31:40 2014 UTC,"Hadn't considered that, flakes I am feeding them now is 45% but maybe a 55-60% might be better ( if I can find it locally that is )."
aquaponics,2ls8ki,three79pete,1 point,Sun Nov 9 19:05:28 2014 UTC,"Unfortunately there will be no simple answer to this problem.  I can assume a degree though to give an idea of what you need to consider.  1 - electrical devices. Typically you will be using at least a water pump and one or more air pumps. Beyond that you may need heating, ventillation etc. If you're planning on having your entire system inside a shed you will also need lighting to provide UV for your plants which will also increase your ventilation needs.  2 - environment. How much sunlight do you get, how much does your daylight level change from summer to winter? How much space do you have to fit solar panelling?  3 - how much money do you have? Solar PVs are expensive.  Basically you need to work out how much energy your system is going to need and whether your location / environment is going to be able to supply that energy and then whether you can afford to build it all.  I have to wonder why you would choose to do it in a shed rather than just build a greenhouse?"
aquaponics,2ls8ki,denjin,1 point,Sun Nov 9 19:29:09 2014 UTC,Shed or greenhouse don't much matter i suppose.  I live in canada(south Saskatchewan)  so winters are gonna be tricky either way heat will be needed.  I do get lots of sun through the day so thats not a big concern.
aquaponics,2ls8ki,NoGodJustMe,1 point,Sun Nov 9 20:08:40 2014 UTC,"I'm not sure if the amount of heat you retained from sunlight in the greenhouse would make up for loss due to poor insulation during winter in Saskatchewan. Just speculation, though."

My ap system is indoors, but in the future I plan to make a bigger one outside. It's all just an idea in my head, but when/if I make the system it would be in a shed or greenhouse and be heated with a plant pot space heater, but on a bigger scale.

aquaponics,2ls8ki,Verusauxilium,1 point,Mon Nov 10 01:12:58 2014 UTC,The zinc that is coated over the steel is what makes galvanized steel so bad.

aquaponics,2ls8ki,cocacholas,1 point,Mon Nov 10 07:51:28 2014 UTC,"I recently installed an off-grid solar aquaponics system in Philly. Your temps are gonna be even worse than mine in Saskatchewan. Basically for heating the energy needs of the heating (assuming electrical heaters) are gonna be way more than any other energy needs. Also electrical heating isn't always the most efficient. I know the FrostyFish guy is up on doing cold weather-ponics. If you had a grid tied system you could draw energy from the grid for your heating needs and have the solar as a supplement, and as the summer comes run mostly off your panels.  If you want to do an off-grid, and ignore the heating component (only use in warmer months, find other solution) it isn't that hard. What you'll need is at the least your panels, some DC batteries, and a charge controller. That's if all the components you are running are DC. I'm running AC components, so I also need an inverter (that will give you the power that you're used to in your home).  This is a decent review and simple for beginners on the math you need to size your components.  http://www.wholesalesolar.com/ is a pretty decent site to buy things and everything will be in one place, plus the customer service is good."

aquaponics,2lp9ut,zynix,1 point,Sat Nov 8 20:25:08 2014 UTC,Go through one or two harvests to leave enough dead roots and sediment build up.   After that they just go nutts in a media bed.

aquaponics,2lovda,JustCallMeBrad,3,Sat Nov 8 18:04:36 2014 UTC,"You will need to insulate the tank or just have it indoors, otherwise the water/fish will freeze if it gets cold enough, long enough. There may be submergible heaters for the tank, but on that I am not sure. I would check yourself.  Get an aerator rated for larger than the tank you are getting, and you can get up to 1 lbs of fish per gallon, but expect a less. So thirty gallon tank, I would get 40 and then thin as they get larger...   Peppers do not need cage support, but you can get larger peppers if you use one. Some tomatoes need support, some do not, just depends on the variety you are growing.   Just search some designs, there are tons available. many have specific directions for construction also. That is what I did for mine. And now I am designing a greenhouse/aquaponic set up, roughly 20'x40' heated with a multiple tower set up.

I took a 55 gal plastic drum cut it in half long ways . They rest on top of 2- 2×6 board with wedges . I have two grow beds . The pipe going to the two beds spit and have a ball valve at the end of each . This way I can control the water flow . Let's say I have tomatoes on the left and lettuce on the right .

So a 1000ltr IBC for the fish means you need to allow for at leat 2,000-4,000 ltrs of water in your grow beds.   as well, would you run 1 pump and split it to 3 beds, or 1 pump per bed?   Minimise the pumps you use always to save running costs. The key thing is that you have enough water flow to be able to trigger the grow bed bell siphon to run properly. If you can design your system right, using gravity as much as possible to flow the water from your grow beds back into your sump, you should be able to reduce the pump to the minimum you need.   how many size/ pounds of fish, should i use for this project?

Certainly it's become standard to run systems with at least a 1:1 ratio of fish tank volume: grow bed volume... not water volume (which is less than the actual grow bed volume once displacement of media is factored)....  The old suggested ratio was 1:2... and that's probably still a very valid ratio in terms of plant production with media beds...  But in the end... it doesn't matter, or have to be any particular ration... (within reason)... the bottom line is...  How many fish you can stock... is directly related to the amount of filtration available... usually media volume...."

The fractional return to the sump tank ensures the water is well mixed.    Gravity feeding back to the sump makes it easier to put a sedimentation filter like a swirl or radial flow filter.  CHOP-2 is easier to expand ( multiple fish tanks, multiple sumps, multiple GB's ) then height driven, gravity flow systems.

I say ""tried"" because my latest batch of catfish didn't quite make it to my house and I've decided to hold off on buying more until my guppy population ( they live in the sump ) rebounds.  Being able to put a filter inline from the SLO to the rest of the system is something I could see as difficult with CHIFT/PIST if it flows directly into the GB without raising the FT even higher.  Yes I miss out on several cubic feet of filtration ( water through the media ) but I feel that gives the bed a longer life before I'd need to clean it up ( especially if I throw in worms to help break down dead roots and crap )."

aquaponics,2lhgeg,maxxell13,2,Thu Nov 6 16:15:17 2014 UTC,"Do you already have the ornamentals going, and are now only adding the growbed?  If so, then turn the whole thing on, bell siphon and all.  That way the whole system starts actively seeing your culture water.  That's key.  Dont bother adding gravel from the fish tank into the grow bed.  The bacteria are already found in the water column, so they'll start to colonize the grow bed as soon as you get the water flowing through there.  I do NOT recommend that you grab pond water.  If you already have an established system going, you have plenty of bacteria in the system.  Grabbing pond water only serves to accelerate the process of having the nitrifying bacteria find their way into your system.  Why are you using ammonium chloride in an already-established system?  If you already have fish, they're producing ammonia for you."
aquaponics,2lhgeg,maxxell13,2,Thu Nov 6 16:45:20 2014 UTC,"Yes, the ornamentals are already going strong.

Thanks for the advice."

aquaponics,2lhgeg,JJGBM,1 point,Thu Nov 6 18:30:50 2014 UTC,"Nope. Mine's a pretty standard system. 55-gallon tank. Several different types of fish. I just disturbed the system a bit, though, because I had to drain it down and transfer the fish in order to be able to relocate the tank to below the growbed. About 50% new water was added after that (though no rinsing or cleaning or the gravel). So I'll probably give the tank a few days to settle down before embarking on the next steps.  For what it's worth, I've got my testing kit and the ammonia in that tank has always been registering at zero for the past few months though not really any nitrates to speak of, either. I would assume that's because of the filter I've have running?  Thanks!"
aquaponics,2lhgeg,BrokenByReddit,2,Thu Nov 6 18:48:54 2014 UTC,"Yes, run it exactly as you would with fish and plants.  The more flow, the more oxygen in the water, the better it is for aerobic bacteria.  More surface area = more bacteria = more filtration.  Sponges and gravel will both work.  Gravel will be more difficult to clean, but looks prettier.   It's the substrate the carries the beneficial bacteria, not the water.  You could grab a few rocks from your stream and put them in your tank. I've never used chemicals to start the cycling.  I just throw a few pieces of fish food or some other protein source for the bacteria to start breaking down."

I did it so I could ensure enough water always stayed in the sump so the pump would never run dry or overflow as the GB's fill and drain, as I'm planning to have 3 or 4 GBs in total. Plus it gives me more tanks to separate different sized fish if needed. The connecting pipe just evens out the levels in the two sumps.  The pump is a bit of overkill so I have a diverted pipe plumbed back to to the sumps to control flow to the FT and provide additional aeration to the sump tanks.

There was about a five degree fahrenheit variance between the sensors. They did better on humidity.  We were working on a microclimate-measuring quadcopter and decided that the DHTs weren't gonna do it. I ordered a BMP085 instead and it seemed to agree with the house thermostat and outside thermometer, at least.  It's a little more trouble to program though. If you're OK with your temperature sensor being +/- a few degrees, a DHT should be alright.  Also, IIRC, the default DHT driver code for Arduino was broken in some dumb way. ... oh! That's what it was. I just went through my old project files. You want the DHT driver code from here, not the default stuff that's bundled with Arduino. The default stuff has super frustrating bus timing and i/o issues, forces you to identify the sensor manually, do bus error handling, and all kinds of dumb things, and then doesn't even work reliably after you've done all that.

Each trap will only catch 1 bug at a time and only catch maybe 5 before the plant replaces it. They also require a dormancy period for a few months out of the year to stay healthy longterm.  Something like a cape sundew would probably work a little better. Each leaf can catch several small bugs at once and the plant is tropical and actively growing year round.

As my blog is entirely backyard except for this one post, I haven't incorporated (or truly digested) any of that information.   However I'm interested.    When you differentiate single loop as a bastardization, the alternative (if I understand right) is to create a recirculating aquaculture system where you then divert a portion of the water and/or solid waste either in batches or continuously over to a separate recirculating loop which has plants.  Then a portion of this second loop would feed back to the fish loop at the end of the line (or something like).  In this way aquaponics is a removable add-on to an existing recirculating aquaponics system.  This seems different than the UVI system - as far as I'm aware - since I don't think they had a biofilter.  I know I've got reading to do.

The tubes are caped on the sides with holes and more PVC leading down to the next tube. So each one fills up about 3/4's o the way up the tube before the water flows down into the next tube, they are stacked vertically in a ladder configuration so water flows down through each tube before going back into the tank. So its not Nutrient Flim Technique as the tubes are almost completely full of water. I have some air stones in the tubes to give more aeration but the roots seem to do fine. Works really well for lettuce, probably herbs too, nothing more substantial than that."

It is slightly off the ground, surrounding it with a blanket isn't possible as one side is backed against the house. My problem comes from the fact that when my grow beds drain they go through a few feet of air down into the tank and that's how I get my aeration, so the water really cools down then. I wrapped the open air sections up with a plastic tarp so the wind wouldn't get in there and make it super cold but that won't work for really cold nights in succession.

It wouldn't entire prevent it, but have you tried getting a larger diameter pipe to go over your grow bed drains and down into the tank?   In a chop-2 in my basement I did that with the 50% fractional return line and it's still kept up the aeration as it pulls air down into the water.    Otherwise you're likely correct that with the water falling down, that increases the surface area and should chill the water to half way or further to the dew point."
aquaponics,2l0hh4,zynix,1 point,Sun Nov 2 17:11:07 2014 UTC,Yeah I'm thinking a combination of covering those drain tubes and a heater is what I'll go with. I can move some air stones into the tank from my flood tubes to counter the loss of aeration.

My new property(hopefully) backs up to a stand of trees so with a good greenhouse design using whatever wood scraps I find in a rocket stove I should have no problems heating. Not to mention the greenhouse alone should do it. Here in Florida we can get down into the 20s or 30s air temp, but the sun's strength never really goes away like it does up north. Without a constant influx of cold air from the north the sun still has enough energy mid winter to get into the 80s. So a good sunny greenhouse should do quite well. I'm just sort of gambling that I'll get to move the fish before it becomes a huge problem.   The more I think on it though I think I'll just have to suck it up and buy a heater, or build my own.

I am interested as well if anyone has found a good solution."
aquaponics,2kzb4x,llewellynwest,1 point,Sat Nov 1 18:46:24 2014 UTC,Consider designing a sort of water wall at the drain. Try to make the water roll out as opposed to pouring out.

aquaponics,2kzb4x,paradoxbomb,1 point,Sat Nov 1 16:06:17 2014 UTC,"I have found that with my drains, any alteration I make (i.e. lengthening the pipes below my bed) causes the drains to not work correctly. They would never stop siphoning so I always put the original pipes back on. Mine use a 1.5"" pipe I believe so if yours are the same, your can probably have them fall into a 4"" vertical PVC drain that comes up as high as the elbow where the water falls out of the siphon and ends somewhere below the water level of your tank. This sleeve should allow the siphon to work normally as you are not attaching it and air can flow in or out as needed. It probably won't cut all the noise out but it should help. As for O2, I wouldn't rely solely on the aeration provided by your bell siphon, get a compressor and some stones. Good Luck!"
aquaponics,2kzb4x,CloudHead,1 point,Sat Nov 1 20:48:17 2014 UTC,"I have a similar setup to yours and got mine to be reasonably quiet by piping the water against the side of the tank. This makes the pipe long, and the key is that it MUST have a downward angle for part of the horizontal length (don't make it level). You can do this by adding a 45 degree angle fitting and rotating it so the terminal pipe is sloping downward.  Additionally, you actually can stick the end of this pipe underwater provided that you allow air to enter back in to the pipe to equalize the pressure when the siphon shuts off.  This is as easy as drilling one or two hole around 1/4"" in diameter that stay above the water line at all times.  These also provide a venturi effect when draining, helping to oxygenate the water.  The end of the pipe can't be too far underwater though, or the grow bed won't drain fast enough to shut the siphon off.  I have mine set up so that the pipe is above the water level when the drain starts, and is completely covered when it stops.  It took a lot of trial and error to get the setup to work correctly and be quiet enough, so buy a bunch of piping and basically just try it out until it works.  Now it sounds like gurgling, flowing water as opposed to a flushing toilet.  With the lid on, it's really not too bad."
aquaponics,2kzb4x,Aquaponics-Heretic,1 point,Sun Nov 2 01:41:18 2014 UTC,Cool. Thanks for the tips. Why is the downward angle for the horizontal length of the terminal pipe so important?
aquaponics,2kzb4x,hamlajy,1 point,Sun Nov 2 17:41:51 2014 UTC,"Basically just gravity.  I can't 100% explain the physics behind it, but basically water in a level pipe creates back pressure more than an angled pipe. If you have too much back pressure, the siphon will have problems starting and/or stopping.  This of course depends on how long the horizontal length is in relation to the other parts of the system.  The downward angle adds a gravity boost to help pull the water out.  I noticed this through trial and error. I plumbed a section completely flat and suddenly the siphon wouldn't turn off and was draining slower.  With a downward angle it works."
aquaponics,2kzb4x,zynix,1 point,Sun Nov 2 18:38:15 2014 UTC,"OK. That makes sense. In my initial implementation outside for the leak testing, I already had to experiment some with the downspout to make sure it had the appropriate back pressure. The siphon wasn't kicking in initially."

aquaponics,2kswct,Verusauxilium,6,Thu Oct 30 17:58:38 2014 UTC,"With bio filters It's mostly about providing a large surface area in a relatively small volume for the aerobic bacterial bio-films to grow on, without restricting the water flow so much that they get oxygen deprived and die off, or get displaced by anaerobic bacteria that set about undoing all the good work.   It's pretty much just the same thin film of slime that turns up on anything you leave in a pond or bucket for a while but you can get 'bacterial starter kits'  for new ponds and filters to speed up the process of getting established a bit.  Sooner or later though, if water is flowing and the environment is right they will just show up and colonise the media, unless you're working in a clean room, in space, even then I'd not bet against them turning up.  You ideally need separate mechanical/settlement filters before the bio-filter just to stop the 'big lumps' from clogging it all up and mucking up the flow, but the bio-filter will end up doing a bit of mechanical filtration too and collect crap over time, and likewise, a set of mechanical filter sponges or the sides and pipes throughout the filter tanks / ponds will support some bacteria too.  All your bio filter is really doing is squashing the same surface area you'd get naturally from a huge lake, into a relatively small system, and sticking it somewhere you can pass all the water through in a vaguely controlled fashion."
aquaponics,2kswct,NobblyNobody,5,Thu Oct 30 20:21:23 2014 UTC,Bacteria will live on any surface. A bio media such as ceramic or plastic creates a massive surface areafor the bacteria to live on. Take a look in an aquarium shop at the filters. Look at the size of the filter rated to the volume of water. Personally I would just about half that number. The filter size will also include media to physically filter the water. This will also support bacteria but the core will be in the bio media.
aquaponics,2kswct,Earlier_this_week,3,Thu Oct 30 18:39:58 2014 UTC,"To answer your question; Bacteria are everywhere.  Including the beneficial bacteria you want to incubate in your bio filter.  Most of the time, they are within your city or well water (even though it has chemicals in it), only a couple need to survive to establish and make a colony.  Some people use only reverse osmosis water or filtered water, which can lengthen the amount of time required to have the colony establish (maybe they need to move in from some other water source?).  But, this can be given a helping hand usually with ""bacteria in a bottle"" type of additives, like SeaChem Stability.  Depending on your setup, they will grow on any porous surface.  Plastic container walls? Check. Grow media? Check. Plastic is actually a very porous surface.  To give them the optimal environment, you want to give them ample amounts of porous surface.  Such as a filter, or grow media."

aquaponics,2kswct,denjin,2,Fri Oct 31 16:32:01 2014 UTC,"Lot of good answers,  one trick to speeding up the cycling process, rinse, soak, and leave your media outside over night.  As long as the temp stays above 60F through the night you should get some spores to land on it.  Edit/update:  I wasn't able to explain why I think this.   I have a 50 gallon system in my basement devoted to researching ideas, one side effect of various tests is that I have had to reset it 4x in the last few months alone ( 3 of those were with different sterile media ).  First time I cycled I noticed nitrites showed up within 24 hours of cycling ammonia, 2nd time I rinsed and setup all in doors and it took 4 days for nitrite to show up,  3rd time I did the rinse, wash, and soak outside with a 48 hours to nitrites showing up.   Nitrosomonas takes 15~36 hours to double in size so the faster your media can be colonized the faster you can get your system cycled and up to speed.  Incidentally, if you're setting up your system outdoors then all you'd need to do is make sure theirs air circulation over wet media."
aquaponics,2kp4ku,mangletron,4,Wed Oct 29 18:10:12 2014 UTC,"The bacteria living on the grow media will be able to survive to some extent (assuming they're not left to dry out, nor left in buckets too long to allow anoxic conditions to massacre the colonies).  Even in a best-case scenario, dont assume it will be equally as capable of consuming ammonia immediately upon rebuild.  You might have to reduce your tilapia biomass or do a series of water exchanges to keep it running.  But when you do rebuild, you'll basically have a great head start to cycling the new system."

aquaponics,2kludt,zynix,2,Tue Oct 28 23:09:19 2014 UTC,"Rain water ""can"" be a good source, would recommend checking any EPA reports on how clean the rain is around your parts.  A secondary source of water could be found via Brita water filters -    Studies of the effects of filtration using the Brita® filter revealed that the Brita® filter removed, on average, 89.4% of the calcium. There was variability of the Brita® function, with postfiltration concentration ranging from 0.8 to 30.3%. It is notable that the seven new filters used for the seven different trials present with significantly varied efficacy. In our current example, one specific sample retained over 38 times the calcium of the lowest sample. Both samples were filtered using two different previously unused filters from the same brand. The standard deviation of the percent remaining was 3.19. It is highly unlikely that this is an individual and unrepresentative manufacturing error because of the persistent variability throughout the seven trials. It may, however, be specific to the group of filters selected for our purposes. The filtration treatment left Perrier® water with a substantially lower calcium concentration, in the same range as tap and spring waters ( http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2488164/     Full paragraph was quoted because of how unreliable the various Brita filters were in a controlled study.  I've sent an email to the company a few months ago and didn't get a reply unfortunately.   IF you do decide to go with the Brita filtration approach, I'd highly recommend doing some ratio of filtered:unfiltered water because there are a number of trace nutrients that municipal tap can provide ( zinc, boron, etc ) that are really difficult to source and even harder to add to a system without murdering it.   Additionally you would be a lab rat for this as I wasn't able to find out if the ionized silver particles passed through, silver is a super effective anti-bacterial molecule so that would murder an AP system.  Otherwise two things you can check is the carbonate hardness of your water ( KH ), the API KH & GH test kit is pretty good at this."

aquaponics,2kludt,col381,3,Wed Oct 29 19:53:20 2014 UTC,"Plants, fish, and bacteria all have natural pH ranges they like to operate in.  Nitrifying bacteria have a fairly wide range, fish and plants less so.  Fortunately, all 3 overlap in the 6.6 - 7.4 range (approximately).  When your pH gets too high (above 7.4), then your plants will start to suffer.  Not necessarily die, but they'll stop thriving.  High pH inhibits plants from uptaking crucial micronutrients like iron and calcium.  This varies with the plant species, so make sure to look up how tolerant your plants are.  Some plants (like blueberries) require very low pH values and can't be grown using common aquaponics techniques.  Many fish are fine at higher pH levels (8+), but at lower levels they can have problems depending on the species.  Also, the bacteria stop working around 6.0, which can crash your biofilter.  Not good.  Finally, one of the worst things to do is cause your pH to swing more than about 0.2 per day. Doing so will stress your fish, and when they get stressed they become susceptible to the non-beneficial bacteria that they are constantly surrounded with and will get sick.  A similar thing happens to us when we get stressed as well.  If you can't get your pH to stabilize, then you likely have a low KH value. In a nutshell, the lower the KH, the more your pH will swing when you try to adjust it.  KH is a whole topic unto itself though.  In answer to your edit, there's a LOT of aquaponics practiced in Australia, and I'm pretty sure their heat level exceeds ""kinda hot"".  So look to the Aussies for what to do in hot weather!"
aquaponics,2kl7h4,remthewanderer,5,Tue Oct 28 17:46:51 2014 UTC,"The ratio of growbed to fish tank is misleading.  If you have a 1-ton tank, but only one tilapia in it, how much grow bed do you really need?   The real issue (for ammonia concerns) is biomass of fish vs. nitrifying bacteria. Fish tank size is a proxy for fish biomass, and growbed size is a proxy for bacterial colonies. But you need to understand that the tank size doesn't create ammonia, it's the amount of fish in the tank.   So if you want to have a big fish tank with a a small grow bed, go for it. Just make sure you don't stock that fish tank with too many fish.  Similarly, if you have a humongous growbed but not many fish, you'll have plenty of nitrifying bacteria to keep ammonia low. It's just that your plants may not get enough nutrition to be healthy so you should not stock the huge growbed full of plants.   Summary: it's all about biomass, not tank size."
aquaponics,2kl7h4,maxxell13,2,Tue Oct 28 18:44:38 2014 UTC,"FT to GB ratio's is like the pirate's code, it's more of a guideline than a rule.  Stock for your GB size and not the FT; just because you can eat an entire pizza doesn't mean you should, similarly just because you can stock a lot of fish into your tank, doesn't mean its going to work out well.  Most/all professional recommendations suggest that you need to turn the water in your FT over and through the GB at least 2x an hour ( if you have 180 liters, 360 liters needs to pass through the bed every hour, for one of my systems it's more like 600 liters per hour ).  Pretty sure /u/Sycosys 's question is leading towards a similar train of thought, ensuring the level of filtration for your fish stocking density is enough to keep your fish alive."

One insanely fun thing is the rocket stove + thermal mass + solar water heater combo.. I am able to very cheaply add enough heat (2-3 16x6x6inch pieces of firewood) to that big pile of dirt to feel it wafting up out of the soil. The water heater sits above that pile of soil.   Also the heat exchanger for the thermal mass, just using the heat of the day seems to be very effective at raising intake air temperatures by 10-15 degrees during the coldest bits of early morning.   The plants are hanging in there nicely. i have new tomatoes plants coming up (slowly) and the beefsteak is still rather heathy. All the herbs are fine.   January is going to be a different beast. I am getting cautiously optimistic that i can keep the pond/growbeds liquid and warm ~35-40 degrees. I was looking up sun angles today and we have ~10 or so degrees worth of solar dip to go before it starts climbing.. it's at 36 degrees at around solar noon today.. on Dec 21st it is 25 degrees.

aquaponics,2kl7h4,FrostyFish,2,Tue Oct 28 18:44:14 2014 UTC,The ratio that you should really look at in a media system are lbs of fish per ft3 of media.  Grams of feed protein per day per ft3 would be more accurate still but that's more complex and maybe splitting hairs.  From what I've read 1.5 lbs of fish per ft3 of media is generally considered a high stocking rate.
aquaponics,2kl7h4,GrassForce,1 point,Wed Oct 29 00:07:40 2014 UTC,Interesting. I have never thought about the ratio between cubic feet of media and lb's of fish. What I have generally heard in terms of ratio is 1 lb of fish per 10 gallons of water.

aquaponics,2kj9ak,Sycosys,1 point,Fri Oct 31 02:02:07 2014 UTC,Wouldn't hurt to educate yourself with the practice of keeping fish. Aquaponics seems to (in my experience) work best for people who have a good grip on how to keep fish thriving in a fish tank without constant water changes and chemical additives. The best aquariums are as close to balanced bacterial ecosystems as you can get in an artificial setting and adding  food plants to capitalize on that ecosystem is trivial at that point.   I had an acquaintance follow Bernsteins book as closely as he could and his experiment failed after a while simply because he really wasn't up to speed on keeping fish.
aquaponics,2kj9ak,Sycosys,2,Tue Oct 28 16:54:54 2014 UTC,"This mirrors my own experience.  Raising fish was a steep learning curve, and I think I still have a lot to learn even after three years full of both mistakes and successes."

aquaponics,2k5art,EternalNoob,2,Thu Oct 23 23:45:08 2014 UTC,"By my calculation, the DWC beds are each 598 gallons, each media bed is 239 (without media of course). this equals out to 1674 gallons of grow bed space. Koi and Comets both poop a lot, so I think you should be pretty close on grow bed space after the grow media taking up space is accounted for. Depending on where you are, you may need aheater of some kind in there to keep temps up. Luckily a cheaperway to keep things heated is a Rocket Mass heater if youre proficient with building things. One note from the diagram on the site, I have seen some where people build a grate and secondary access under where the fire burns for easier removal of ash, I am sure there are other plans showing this out there, but Im feeling lazy in my search haha. Its also on youtube.  For media, your media beds will need to be pretty stout, as one gallon of water weighs 8.4 pounds, and assuming a 50% decrease in volume due to rock/media, youre looking at about 1000 lbs of water in each bed, so at that point I think the weight of the media wont really be too much of a concern since youre building a box that can hold half a ton of pressure to begin with.   As for drainage, I am not sure on that one, as Ive only gotten to build small systems as of now. I consider myself an informed amateur so take the above with a grain of salt, and I am sure others will check this and correct it where needed. Hope this helps!  Also, root clogging could be an issue with the DWC beds without some kind of a filter system, radial and swirl filters are both good and relatively easy to build options. The media beds could house red wriggler worms to help keep the media nice and aerated to avoid anaerobic spots."
aquaponics,2k5art,froschkonig,1 point,Fri Oct 24 00:07:00 2014 UTC,I'll have several layers of filtration in the system. Mostly by way of filter pads and bags. I understand that using both of those types of filtration are added maintenance but it's my job so...   I'm certainly going to get some wigglers in the media beds. We've had vermiculture systems in the past as an educational demonstration. Those worms do work!  My tank has a stainless screen of sorts a foot away from the standpipe/drain and it looks to me like that is a great place for my initial large solids filter. I'll also have some filter pads in my sump and will use filter bags on the discharge from the pump to polish the water in my dwc's a bit.  I've thought many a time about building a rocket mass heater. Even took a class on it. I think I'd like to fiddle around a bit and eventually will likely build one in the greenhouse. I'll have plenty of room in the front of the house and could even incorporate a nice seating area into it which would be really cool. Maybe next year!
aquaponics,2k5art,Pastelitomaracucho,2,Fri Oct 24 00:58:57 2014 UTC,Don't underestimate how maintenance intensive the filters can be. You can easily end up enslaved by cleaning filters all the time. Take a step back and plan your solids capture carefully so you can enjoy a system that more or less keeps itself clean.

Plus the contents of the swirl/radial filters can be used as fertilizer ( most of it is fish poop after all )."

How intensive do you want it to be?  How are you going to control the solids in the system?  Going ""overkill"" with pipes is a dangerous choice. You have to take into account the flow but velocity is equally important. And pipe that is too large will experience low velocities and will end up accumulating solids. You have to strike a balance between head, flow and velocity.   Again: rule 1) control solids. Rule 2) control solids. Rule 3) control solids."

A little heavier than Hydroton and not as easy on the fingers, but a much better choice than gravel. I bought a ton of it for about $100 from the local materials supplier. It was sold as lightweight expanded aggregate for concrete building applications. Had to spend a few weekends washing it and sorting out some odd rocks but it's been fairly trouble-free otherwise."

The most commonly available sizes are smaller than the preferred sizes for aquaponic media, because they are meant to be mixed into concrete or for engineered soils/fill.  Also be sure to thoroughly wash shale, because depending upon the plant (and distributor) that it comes from it may have some cross contamination from a material with a much higher pH (lime, portland, etc...) - either from a previous batch of a different material in manufacturing or in the materials handling by equipment at distribution. This is a bulk industry commodity, not some prepackaged bagged consumer product. (Some is bagged specifically for consumers, but you are basically paying hydroton prices.)"

aquaponics,2k2xg6,2Ferdi7,4,Thu Oct 23 09:05:49 2014 UTC,"H2O2 is typically used in fish emergencies to add extra oxygen to the water (The extra oxygen molecule breaks off for use) such as during power outages- But it is eventually/actually rather quickly used up. It will not fix an anaerobic spot permanently- Once the extra oxygen is gone, that anaerobic spot will return.  If it's really anaerobic spots this will not be a long term fix. And, if it's growing on an airstone (a place of high water flow) I highly doubt it's an anaerobic issue. It's probably just the plain old slime buildup we all get over time. It could be nirtobacter/nitrosomnas colonies or any of the usual, harmless suspects.   Nitrosomnas/nitrobacter out of a filter (or in the case of aquaponics, where the plants and grow beds are the filters) is a sign that there's ammonia and it's breakdown products (nitrate, nitrite) not being completely utilized by the filter/plants- Those bacterias cannot grow without it and use it, breaking it down into less harmful products.

aquaponics,2jwexl,froschkonig,1 point,Wed Oct 22 02:12:54 2014 UTC,"Yep. There are a few systems out there. Even at commercial scale. I have seen some videos from Murray Hallam.  Problem with NFT is solids plugging and less thermal buffering and water quality buffering in general because there is much less volume of water involved in the process.   Another potential drawback of NFT is that is not as space efficient. You have to walk around tubes to take care of the plants and plants cannot be moved. That might or might not be desirable. Before NFT, deep raft makes more sense."

Filtering is important, not because of blockage however but because root catch all the solids and will eventually rot if not cleaned. Blocakage I guess could be possible but you would need some pretty seriously mature root systems before that happened. I'm in South Australia and the biggest challenge I find they can create is heating/cooling.  When I run water through the NFTs on a 40C day it can raise the water temp by as much as 5C from entry to exit.  Likewise at night if you want to keep your system warm the opposite is true. My system is not yet enclosed.  As for space, I'm considering creating a raft system under the NFTs."
aquaponics,2jvjfe,2Ferdi7,3,Tue Oct 21 10:18:18 2014 UTC,"First: are you measuring nitrate or nitrate-nitrogen? Lc50 for nitrate can be as high as 1000ppm nitrate or 225ppm nitrate-nitrogen. So in any denominaton your nitrate levels were not lethal.   Second: optimal nitrate for plants depends on species: leafy greens thrive on high nitrate, whilst fruiting plants such as tomato and pepper need less than 50ppm otherwise they devote growth to leaves rather than fruit.   Third: there will not be a substantial removal of nitrate in your system unless you create a denitrification device. Therefore, water exchanges are your best bet to keep nitrate on target."

If you have a sunny spot, that micro system will cost MAXIMUM $150-180.  If you don't have a sunny spot, lighting varies but I would recommend some variety of fluorescent ( or compact fluorescent ) fixture ( $100-120 ).   If you google for aquaponic starter kits, they start sometimes @ $3000 and thats for a small one with a lot of things missing still ( media, chemicals, fish, plumbing, etc ).  edit:  Also, a very good overview of Aquaponics is this book by Sylvia Bernstein - http://smile.amazon.com/Aquaponic-Gardening-Step---Step-Vegetables/dp/086571701X/ref=asap_B005RENDS0_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1413895720&sr=1-1  It's a good foundation that goes over major parts of AP ( fish, plants, water testing, media, etc ).  Two things I disagree with:     A lot of people recommend against using feeder goldfish.  I love them because they're insanely cheap, extremely hardy, and they pack on weight fairly decently so you get some validation that they're developing well.  Downside is that if they do survive, they can live for 10 years and they can get a little big A lot of people suggest starting with a 250 gallon system.   That's a lot of money, even if you build almost everything yourself, to invest in something you don't really know anything about.   Dr. Wilson Lennard somewhat sums things up in answering ""What's the biggest threat to building an “Aquaponics Industry” as you see it?"" - http://www.ecofilms.com.au/dr-wilson-lennard-on-the-future-of-aquaponics/   Three things a home or small farm AP system can provide for you:  3 (maybe 4) seasons of plant growth ( coldweatheraquaponics.com has some great idea's for surviving Zone 4 winters ),  fish dinners every few months ( if you stagger your population out ), and once you get to a certain size a system to produce fertilizer for conventional farming ( or for wicking beds )."

There are tons of posts and articles going into the science, but I think the first thing you'll need to decide is what style of grow bed you want, whether your fish will just be ammonia donors or a foodstock (such as tilapia), being that far north, winter temperature considerations (water heaters, possible greenhouse etc.) And what plants you'd like to grow.

A good source for what's safe for fish/AP water are Aquarium websites/documentation, like this one - http://www.theaquariumwiki.com/Copper  For a 100 liter system the 0.10mg/l danger level is 10 milligrams, that's roughly 25 gallons of water and a reasonable reference for how much a milligram is - http://www.answers.com/Q/How_many_milligrams_of_salt_are_there_in_one_teaspoon#   Keep in mind, the reason why copper isn't a problem for municipal and home plumbing is that generally they keep the PH above 7 ( mine is 8.4 ) so that the copper doesn't react.  AP systems, its normal for PH to slip below neutral ( or even stay below neutral into mild acidic levels ( 6.5-6.8 ).  As for steel, I have no idea."

The cheapest is about $100 and more than enough for this application.  Basically, you will get a few dozen channels to input/output signals. It can talk directly with just about any language like Python, Java, C++, Labview, Matlab, and so on. You can make a very serious automated setup if you have the skills for it.  If you just want straight logging, they include a program that will just passively log everything also.  An arduino is the other obvious choice.

Our plan right now is to build a system with a sump tank, sort of based on Chopped II; we have a relatively large space to use in our university greenhouse, so we can build a relatively large system. My school is in Alberta Canada, which gets really cold in the winter, so we want to get a relatively cold-water fish, probably trout or catfish. The water should stay warm enough for either without having to heat it. We haven't really figured out what we plan to feed the fish; probably some type of store-bought fish food to start. The official goal of our club is to, ""establish and maintain a functioning aquaponics system at the University. This system will help club members develop a working knowledge of the field, and related skills. Hopefully through this knowledge the club will promote and nurture sustainable development."" Basically we want to help people learn about aquaponics, so that they can build their own systems, and be more involved in their own food production. That's how we want to promote sustainability.

aquaponics,2jgrl4,Frire,2,Thu Oct 16 23:34:42 2014 UTC,If you do 'constant flood' rather than 'fill-drain' the water in the fish tank will stay constant so you don't need a sump.  If you do 'fill-drain' (you can run the water pump on a timer or continuously) the water level will fluctuate by the amount of water that fits in the growbed before it drains. then it would be smart to size your fish volume by the minimum water level. OR you can incorporate a sump to keep a constant fish tank level.

I've read elsewhere, nothing credible just internet articles, that you start running into problems around 140ppm for Nitrates. I've been doing a ton of reading on the Hydro side of things, but not much on the fish raising side. If anyone has a good book recommendation on amazon I'll pick it up. Specifically Tilapia since that's what I'm probably sticking with."
aquaponics,2jebfe,Whittigo,1 point,Thu Oct 16 13:13:17 2014 UTC,In fact.. while there has been some recent research that suggests that prolonged levels of 150ppm can inhibit growth in sensitive species (such as trout).... and lower levels can be detrimental to fry stages of growth (again in trout)...  The prevailing literature had always listed levels of 350ppm+ as being the lowest level of concern... for Bluegill  And there's just no reason why an aquaponic system should have nitrate levels of 100ppm+ ;)

The fish could of died for many other factors including cats that have full access to the back of the tank right now. Or the stress of water level changing every 10 minutes.  I will be updating to a CHOP system eventually and boxing up the bottom to keep the cats out.    I figured it might be high because it was a very high 20 reading.  It was a very dark orange, almost red. The scale goes from 20 and skips to 40. So really it could be somewhere closer to ~30.

aquaponics,2jdvih,yankeesbroo,3,Thu Oct 16 03:17:09 2014 UTC,"Things to keep in mind:  The deeper the tank relative to volume, the lower the surface area and thus the less area for gas exchange. If you're doing aquaponics this might not be as big of a deal due to all the circulation, unless power goes out, at which point O2 levels will plummet fast.  Deeper tanks are a huge pain to clean. The worst tank I ever maintained (and I've maintained thousands) was a 50 gallon tank 6 feet tall, shaped like a column.  Deeper tanks don't have as much usable space for fish to swim since they usually prefer to swim horizontally rather than up and down. This may cause them stress.  There's no arbitrary limit to how vertical a tank can be. The taller it is, the more pronounced these issues will become. The practical upshot is that the lower and wider, the better, to a certain point of course.  You might have better luck with multiple stacked tanks if footprint space is your limiting factor."
aquaponics,2jdvih,Eclectix,3,Thu Oct 16 22:15:32 2014 UTC,"Pretty tall, I guess.    Just remember that the strength of the tank to hold in the water is based on the depth, the deeper it is the stronger it needs to be.  Even if it's skinny.  A standard base/side may not hold it."
aquaponics,2jdvih,HelloFriendly,2,Thu Oct 16 05:36:17 2014 UTC,"There are a few things that you have to contend with. First, with all of the weight focused on a smaller footprint, you will have to reinforce whatever you place the tank on (this includes the floor and concrete). Second, you will have a smaller surface area which will limit gas exchange. This means that you can have big swings in pH as CO2 will not off-gas as quickly. Also you will have problems getting higher O2 levels in the deeper portion of the tank. Third, with a tall tank you will need to support the sides. This will require a thicker material, for acrylic this means about 1.5 inches thick at minimum. This also means that it will be unstable in tipping. Fourth, it is difficult to clean deeper tanks unless the length and width is substantial. Fifth, many species of fish need a bit room and would benefit from a longer tank rather than a taller one. Overall, the benefit of saved space is outweighed by the many downsides.  Often for aquaponics systems I have seen 55gallon drums work well as they are cheap and easy to get. They are small enough to avoid many problems and you can fit many of them in a smaller space. You will have to carefully select fish species with a smaller tanks though."

I would not recommend that many fish of that type and size for that dimension holding tank.  I would recommend using a smaller vessel like that to house fingerlings of something like tilapia until they are big enough for a grow-out tank. Catfish need a good amount of square footage of floor space. If you are intent on using catfish, I would recommend something long and wide from someplace like www.bonarplastics.com and then use a combo of catfish and tilapia. Then place the plant grow space above the grow-out tank.  I hope that helps, if not, shoot me another message. We can go over more details."

aquaponics,2jdvih,zynix,1 point,Fri Oct 17 01:19:35 2014 UTC,"Only concern I can think of is being able to clean the bottom of the tank or any part near the bottom, some magnets and two rags would work for cleaning the sides but maybe not so much the bottom.  If you start with goldfish, they poop a lot and that builds up."
aquaponics,2jdvih,zynix,1 point,Thu Oct 16 12:15:10 2014 UTC,That's a good question.  That's pretty tall for an aerator to reach the bottom.  I'm not sure what would happen if it didn't.  I'm guessing the oxygen would mix but I'm not 100% sure.  Probably also depends how big the fish are.  I'm guessing a larger fish would prefer a more open tank than a long thin one.

What would you do to ensure plant growth next year? I tried spinach, chili peppers, and strawberries. I let them all germinate before I put them in.

Could any of those be the problem?"

PH?"
aquaponics,2j9dm0,paradoxbomb,1 point,Tue Oct 14 23:17:05 2014 UTC,"For ammonia/nitrates/nitrites I just did my best to eyeball it honestly. I cycled a third of the water every week or two. No fish died as a result of water, but I lost 4 to birds and a watchful cat (once I figured where the missing fish were going, I put an old aquarium figurine in there). And there was growth at first, but then the sprouts stopped. Like I had a morning glory that shot up to 4 inches (grew for the shade and possible food for fish from bugs that'd fall, but temp wasn't an issue). I had one grow in a pot to experiment vine sprawl that did good and one on the fence which is taller than me and is wider than 3 of me laying down. Spinach sprouts just looked like green birds we used to draw in kindergarten. Peppers didn't get high than 2 inches.

aquaponics,2j9dm0,sombre77,3,Wed Oct 15 11:05:12 2014 UTC,"pH is super important.  Basically, if it gets too high plants can't uptake crucial nutrients even though they're present in the water.  Most plants that you can grow aquaponically struggle to thrive at around 7.4 and higher.  Some, like strawberries, won't grow much above 7.0.  Goldfish and algae are much more forgiving about pH - they have no problem up to 8.0+.  The nitrification cycle will naturally lower the pH over time, but if the grow media you're using contains limestone, it will dissolve and raise the pH faster than nitrification can bring it down. Additionally, your city water may have a high pH that you need to balance when topping up water.  I use hydrochloric acid from the local hardware store to pH balance my top up water.  It's about $8 for 32 oz, and it goes a very long way.  Most people use the API test kits for pH (consensus seems to be that the strips aren't very accurate).  There's a low range kit and a high range kit, you'll probably need both.  You can also just go for the full test kit.  Most fish stores will have these kits as well."

aquaponics,2j9dm0,Verusauxilium,1 point,Wed Oct 15 23:51:52 2014 UTC,"PH can vary wildly for a lot of reasons. Having it in the right range is important because if you don't, your plants will be unable to absorb nutrients and will therefore not survive. Traditional gardeners don't usually worry much about PH because it balances more naturally and easily in soil. For hydro, maintaining PH is not optional."
aquaponics,2j9dm0,issicus,2,Wed Oct 15 11:26:39 2014 UTC,"After looking at your pictures I am willing to bet that your ph is probably way off, also with all the extra dead plant material has raised your ammonia way to high."

A good portion of this ends up as solid organic matter in the tank and bed; sort of like a rich mucky dirt. It is especially an issue for big systems or densely stocked tanks.  After a number of months, you'll get a significant amount built up. It begins to clog plumbing and stop your siphon working. It'll gunk up the media causing root rot. It can collect in clumps in some corner then suddenly dislodge and throw the system out of balance.  Not a big deal for smallish systems if you clean them out regularly. But, I lost my first tank by solids collecting up and resulting in a sudden bloom in the water that sucked up all the oxygen after about 18 months.  Look up swirl filters.

One other change I'm incorporating into the wiki page is to take top rated self.posts on the various additives and use them as citations, so as to make the wealth of information already on /r/aquaponics more accessible and help cut down on ""But why male models"" repeating questions about the same stuff which isn't fair to anyone ( especially those asking the question for the first time and those that are like ""omg we covered this last week!"" )."
aquaponics,2j30ft,ColdWeatherAquaponic,2,Mon Oct 13 03:15:04 2014 UTC,I don't think it's all that complicated.  Basically avoid EDTA.  DPTA is the most common choice due to its cost-effectiveness and since it doesn't turn your water red.  If you have a real high pH it wouldn't work for you though.  This chart is what I found the most helpful.

A swirl filter will be helpful long term.  There are some folks who have had problems with bed clogging in a very short amount of time, and others who claim to have gone much longer.  Either way, it's a huge chore to clean them when the time comes.  There's a media you can find at landscape stores called various things.  Around here it's called Arizona Mountain Bark.  It works well for media, and is fairly lightweight.  I think you're right - water heater in the fish tanks works best, from my perspective.  That's where the temperature needs to stay the most stable.  Assuming you have the water chemistry figured out, the thing that's mostly likely to harm your fish the most is lack of oxygen.  Using multiple aerators (for backup) and a backup power source will give you peace of mind.  Good luck!  I'll look forward to hearing more as you learn and progress."
aquaponics,2ionxy,ColdWeatherAquaponic,1 point,Wed Oct 8 21:00:50 2014 UTC,"I ran an NFT type system off my 500 Gallon ornamental pond this summer and planted 72 plants of various types.

With the exception of the fact that I had to keep adding Potassium Nitrate however it was a huge success.   As to grow media, if you can design things in such a way as to use net-pots Hydroton becomes a more reasonable option.   How cold does your basement get that you want a water heater? The gold fish wont care much or are you planning now for Tilapia? Or planning to grow really warm area plants? If you need one the stock tank is where to put it"

I am probably going to hold off on the tilapia -  I want to get a feel for the system before buying them, and then I assume it will be getting cold and I worry about them dying in transport. When and if I do get tilapia I hope to get a breeder colony set up eventually, but I know I won't be able to grow all the fry to mature size.

My indoor system is hydroponic, so no fish, but with the furnace and the grow lights my basement tends to be fairly warm in the winter. The bacteria should be fine down to the mid or even low fifties and obviously different plants need different temps. One thing I didn't think of in my previous post is the fact that a fishes metabolism slows down in colder temps and you will want them growing as fast as possible to provide the ammonia you need, as long as you can be sure the water is oxygenated gold fish are ""happy"" enough up to the mid 70's. So there is a use for a heater, and the place for it is in the stock tank.  All I have is the ornamental pond, the fish are constantly spawning but if I don't provide a place for the newly hatched fry to be safe they are quickly eaten. I've been keeping fish for 35 or so years but this was the first year I ever put them to work, if I ever get the final write-up finished I'll post it here."

aquaponics,2ilsrs,Orc_,1 point,Tue Oct 7 22:48:24 2014 UTC,"If you can keep the temperature below 29C, there's other species like catfish that are as hardy as tilapia.   Also, for aquaculture alone, thats really water/filtration intensive ( fish poop a lot ), so perhaps a compromise of aquaculture and a smaller scale aquaponic system to help on the filtration?    I briefly talked to a commercial AP operator in Pennsylvania that uses Aquaponics to grow animal feed versus human food.  Perhaps you can make more money selling that to local farmers?"
aquaponics,2ilsrs,zynix,2,Tue Oct 7 23:23:09 2014 UTC,Yeah I thought about that! An hybrid system that uses plants to help filtration and maybe even said plants could be used to feed the fish too.

If you have a spring and your local government allows you to use the water and return it to the stream (and you can get good prices for your fish), aquaculture can do okay.  Around here, aquaponics folks seem to do better than those who try recirculating aquaculture alone.  For them, the plants are the profitable bit.  The fish are just for nutrient production and show."
aquaponics,2ilsrs,aquaponix,0,Wed Oct 8 21:09:45 2014 UTC,"These are entirely different beasts, but when it comes to ""profit"" it's much easier to make money when you have a set focus instead of crossing the streams, so to speak, with aquaponics. Aquaponics is a great hobby or perfect for small scale commercial production, but in reality your fish will be much more valuable to you as a nutrient source than a salable protein source. This is especially true when you factor in market prices for the fish you'll raise - something a lot of aquaponic practitioners forget about. Most of the time, in order to make money on their fish, aquapons have to sell fish at 3-4x market value, which no one will buy. And if you can't sell anything, you're not really in business anymore.."
aquaponics,2ih81h,RangerGranger,4,Mon Oct 6 19:37:18 2014 UTC,"It sounds like you have a lot of the components already. Some of your up front cost are covered, about all you would need is a pump & media. Gravel is pretty cheap media and works well. There is a design for a 3 IBC tank system that might be a good start  Having a barn, it might be possible to house the fish & sump inside & run piping to your growbeds outside, preferably south facing. Put up a small greenhouse or hoophouse in winter for the growbeds.  What I have found is outside you pay for heat.  Inside you pay for lights. So I find that a good compromise.  Get an understanding of the process, some design ideas, and get started.  You will learn some as you go. Choose fish for your temperature zone & cycle properly before you add fish.  I would definitely throw in a solids collector as it is easy & will save time & trouble in maintenance.  Your flow should be fishtank-solids filter-growbeds-sumptank. One pump in sump. CHIFT-PIST.  Good Luck, have fun, enjoy fresh fish, organic veggies."

I don't regret any of that because it was a constant learning experience PLUS I learned about everything I needed to operate a stable AP system before I started going above the 100 gallon mark.  http://www.instructables.com/id/Easy-and-Cheap-IKEA-Indoor-Aquaponics-System/  I built my first one off this, it cost me ~$200 ( $60 for a LARGE compact fluorescent light [ ~2' long ], ~$30 for media, $20 for pump, $10 for containers, rest of the $ went into chemicals/nutrients & PVC ).    Everyone else advocates ""Build a 200 gallon system as its more stable""  thats true... but what the hell do you do when your 200 gallon system trainwrecks because you didn't know that you should use something like baking soda to stabilize your PH ( a healthy aquaponic system is going to constantly move towards being acidic due to the nitrates )."

I started with a small hydroponic system, which let me get my head around the plant side of things before risking fish.  A 10 gallon tote and a pizza dough tray make a great starter system, for $30.

aquaponics,2ih81h,Orc_,1 point,Tue Oct 7 01:05:35 2014 UTC,Pizza dough tray! Wish I'd thought of that. I started with a 75 gallon aquarium I had in my garage and a series of cement mixing trays. The fish never lasted long though. My neighbor told me it was the plastic. He's a landscaper and builds a lot of ponds. I now only ever use food-grade plastic (although in the beginning it was hard to tell which plastics were ok).

aquaponics,2ih81h,LonginiusSpear,-2,Tue Oct 7 01:01:37 2014 UTC,"I'd recommend spending at least a year researching and talking to folks on the online forums before you build anything.  Using a design guide is a good idea and will save you headaches, even if it prevents you from using free materials that you have sitting around.  I would discourage you from using a simple flood-and-drain system without solids removal.  This is a hassle labor-wise long term.    In the south, I'm not sure there's a good reason to do it inside your barn rather than out in the open air.  Grow lights use a lot of energy.  A kit like this one would work just fine out of doors."
aquaponics,2ih81h,ColdWeatherAquaponic,2,Mon Oct 6 20:53:16 2014 UTC,"I know this is slightly off topic from the OP, but why remove the solids?   Can you quote any aquaponics sources that have simply left the solids in place, what adverse impact that lead to? Proven, assumed or otherwise?  BTW, I'm a huge fan of your posts in this subreddit and I look to you for inspiration, not joking.  (no homo)."
aquaponics,2ih81h,LonginiusSpear,3,Mon Oct 6 21:13:13 2014 UTC,"Thanks LS.  I appreciate the kind words :)  The adverse impact is that your beds become anaerobic and suck up all the oxygen from your water, thus leaving none for your fish or plant roots to breathe.  Anaerobic bacteria also releases toxic chemicals that can harm your plants and fish.  Here's a recommendation by Dr. Wilson Lennard that you clean your grow beds every 3-6 months.  If you ask me, this is a conservative approach.  I've known people to go longer than this, but nobody I'm aware of has yet quantified how long you can go without cleaning your media given specific feed rates, etc... I'm asking around and hoping to get some anecdotal data on what people have found based on their own experiences.  Someone on AP Nation says that he knows of several setups that have gone anaerobic within a year (see last post on this page).  At the end of the day, whether you have to clean out your grow beds every 3 months or every 5 years, it's still a huge, back-breaking hassle.  Adding solids filtration isn't that hard, and it's totally worth it."
aquaponics,2ih81h,dirt_ed,2,Mon Oct 6 22:07:43 2014 UTC,"Awesome, thank you. Totally answered my question.   I'm learning quite a bit from this hobby. I'm coming at this from an entirely different angle than most. I'm a former saltwater Berlin style reef keeper.   In the Berlin system, the goal is to create anaerobic zones inside of live rock to process your N03 by creating a surface layer of bacteria processing your N02. I thought the air exposure from the bell siphon surge would solve that issue. But even in that system you want to remove complex organics from the system using a protein skimmer.   I'll simply use a mechanical filter before my pump to remove solids and clean it regularly.  Thank you again for everything you do."
aquaponics,2ih81h,ColdWeatherAquaponic,2,Mon Oct 6 22:28:36 2014 UTC,"I haven't cleaned my solids yet, and it's been a year and 4 months. Of course, my media is soil, and the worms are happy to process it all for me."

aquaponics,2ih81h,ColdWeatherAquaponic,1 point,Tue Oct 7 01:06:27 2014 UTC,"Flood/drain. To be fair, I'm pretty sure that I'll have to do my own version of cleaning the media, but it'll be more invasive and less frequent. As the soil components break down, the pore spaces fill in, which means it doesn't drain as well. I'm pretty sure that over time I'll have to treat my system as a soil production unit. Every year or two I'll dump all the soil into my in-ground garden (looks like I'm   going to need to make one) and start over. In a few weeks, I'm going to make a woodchip bed and see how that works for media. There will be mushrooms growing on the woodchips."
aquaponics,2ih81h,dirt_ed,1 point,Tue Oct 7 03:28:25 2014 UTC,Sounds like a great idea.  Your soil that you add to your garden will be awesome!    I've heard that the trick for identifying when your grow bed has gone anaerobic is that you can smell a slightly sweet odor coming from it.  I can't verify this since I don't have a sense of smell.
aquaponics,2ih81h,Tiborik,1 point,Tue Oct 7 04:22:35 2014 UTC,"I am hoping it will be awesome. It should be like compost/worm castings that have been treated with fish manure for a year. Plus, the water dumps into a small composting chamber first where the worms break it down and the worms and the water distrubite the nutrients. Now I just need to buy a house where I can make a garden.   I think I don't really have a problem with anaerobic pockets. I know well what anaerobic soil smells like and I have yet to hit any when I am digging or planting. I think that the worms do a lot of the work. The flood/drain cycle helps the most, though. When it floods, the water drains slowly from the soil, which means that the water level in the soil rises and pushes out the (stale) air. When the water receeds, it sucks back in fresh air. At least that's the plan."

Otherwise, it will just be 10 people talking over each other about what the presenter should have / could have done better for reason x, y, or z. Give them time to talk about their system, and if the presenter wants to break for a question, then the moderators can pick a topical one from the list of questions that have been logged or a general one if nothing is topically relevant at the breakpoint.

A combo greenhouse, aquaponics tank, rabbit hutch system in a house.  The greenhouse and aquaponics system grew plants (and the tank was the thermal heat sink for the greenhouse) and the rabbits ate all the greenhouse waste (plus some feed).  The rabbit droppings were fed to tilapia and the tilapia tank was regularly mucked out for fertilizer in the greenhouse.  Pretty slick!"

aquaponics,2hx8l9,skuba,3,Wed Oct 1 12:54:32 2014 UTC,"Just to pinpoint what you're asking, AP depends on fish food & small amounts of nutrients ( phosphate, iron, magnesium, etc ).   You'd like to close the loop entirely by feeding the fish what grows in the AP system?    That's theoretically possible but the main benefits of AP is closed loop circulation which cuts down on water needs ( 5% or less of what a conventional farm would use), organic to borderline organic food, nitrate/minerals for conventional farming,  and given enough investment 4 seasons/year around growth.   Harvesting fish for food is more of a bi-annual/necessary reward but not a major profit source.  Edit/addendum -  SRAC's reports/fact sheets are considered one version of the Aquaponics holy bible.  A lot of the 400 series reports like this one - http://fisheries.tamu.edu/files/2013/09/SRAC-Publication-No.-454-Recirculating-Aquaculture-Tank-Production-Systems-Aquaponics-Integrating-Fish-and-Plant-Culture.pdf  are insanely invaluable.

Really, Aquaponics is just a very miniature variant of what the earth does naturally anyway. All water is recycled in a closed loop. (minus what the Earth looses to space.)  I fully agree with you, and globally speaking, the entire planet is basically a huge Aquaponics system.  We're just making Leggo sets mimicking it on a tiny scale. :)"
aquaponics,2hx8l9,Terminal-Psychosis,2,Wed Oct 1 17:02:03 2014 UTC,"Does it actually take that much water, or is that 5% based on what we pay for the TRANSPORT of said water?   Against conventional farming, I think the 5-10% quote is comparing against flood style irrigation where a farmer literally floods their field in a controlled manner (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_irrigation ).  A large portion of the water is lost through evaporation or it passing through to sub-water table levels ( not always but a lot of times, aquifers are capped with impermeable stone/rock which is problematic as it accelerates aquifer depletion ).  Water transportation is usually not the most expensive part in the USA because of various systems like viaducts, canals, and a pond/lake system the name of which I cannot remember ( basically a rock lined 5-8' deep ditch meant to trap water long enough for it to go into the water table, earning the owner water credits ).  I think aquaponics is great and it's going to play a role in future food sourcing, but it just cannot compete with conventional mass production capabilities.  So perhaps something like high density aquaculture attached to a wicking bed system is going to fill the gap as there's less parts to break down, it maximizes water usage, prevents salt accumulation, and provides a cheaper supply of nitrate.  Obvious downside is that if there's a flood, topsoil erosion will occur a lot faster and a significant capital investment in heavy duty liner, rocks, and retooling of equipment."

I feed them all my food waste, and they feed my fish. I haven't started shitting in their bin, but I'm sure they would eat it readily. My thought is that their unique life cycle will ensure that any contaminating bacteria will stay in the soldier fly bin and not enter the fish tank or come into contact with the plants.

Latest research on zero exchange recirculation systems point out that hormones (that is, hormones that are naturally produced by the fish) accumulate in zero exchange although the consequences of this have not been completely elucidated. Heavy metals (in case there is some input from construction materials, water or feed) are also thpught to accumulate.   Energetically speaking, it is impossible to keep a system 100% closed (read about entropy). There will always need at least some sort of input required. An algae/shrimp system for example will need in the first place a source of nutrients for the algae to bloom. Let's say that you give a first boost of nutrients and then you want to try to keep the system closed:   In very simple terms: Algae are produced>shrimp eat algae and convert it to biomass>part of that energy consumed stays in the body of the animal and the other part is excreted>now you have only a fraction of the nutrients available to the algae. Rinse and repeat.and system collapses unless you do something about it.   Then obviously we can get complicated and talk about the nutritional profile of the algae for the shrimp, digestitibility of the algae,  what and how much is stored and what and how much is released back in the water and things get a bit more complicated."

Personally I was fine with that but add the interest payments on top and it was break-even at best. That is a big red flag because it probably means in real life it will run at a loss.  Running a backyard system that supplements your food bill but which the capital oats are small enough to be bought out of modest savings, that is a good investment outside the USA. The rest of the first world spends about 15-25% of their incomes on food; the USA only 5% - the economics of this is fairly horrific and to say the system that provides you with this food is unsustainable and that the food is poor quality is an incredible understatement. If you are on this kind of sub there is a chance you are already interested in concepts like food security - and you will not need me to tell you that the more complex and highly subsidized systems are the most vulnerable to collapse and malfunction. Growing 20-30% of your own food will: - massively increase the quality of your diet  - place you in an advantageous position in any future food crisis - provide you with enough surplus food that you can make plenty of preserves and pickles  - have enough of both fresh and preserved food that you will be able to supplement you extended family/help your elderly or improverished neighbors/bribe the future Homeland Security local are command chief for bureaucratic favors (you know, once the army and police are combined and Americans require hall passes to cross county borders LOLspiracy!) - take up about 10 hours per week of your time  This small, 1000 hole configuration will allow you to continue to hold down a regular job, and gradually expand your system (or at least, accumulate all the necessary components, even if you don't put them all into operation) debt-free, and pay off whatever land you need using debt. Depending on how stable your situation is, and how good your conventional wage-based income is, you could be able to run a medium-large scale commercial operation within 10 years or at least before retirement age. At that point you will need employees, but only 1 full time, and 2 part time, and with you putting in a full 40 hours (over 7 days, welcome to Small Business where the fun never stops). But since you'll have paid off your hectare of land and will have all the stuff you need with no debt required, the maths will work for it. At that point you should be thinking of a system with about 16 tanks and 10k-20k 'holes' (depending on the market realities of where you live, labour costs, and of course how greedy you actually are :) )  The great thing about aquaponics is that it is the kind of physical labour one can do well into retirement, since it is mostly at waist-height.  Also by starting with the backyard system you will be training yourself and you will know for sure whether or not you will be able to handle a large commercial operation by the time you can afford it, rather than taking on debt only to find it isn't going to work for whatever reasons, then being stuck with repayments on un-resellable plant.  Finally, in any future scenario, energy costs for conventional agriculture will rise, and because aquaponics uses just a modest amount of electricity your viability will be much more secure. Conventional ag is hugely reliant on liquid fuels (ie petroleum) as well as using 10x more pesticides than aquaponics. So you will find over the long term that your competitiveness increases in relation to the absurdly cheap food that is currently available. And if you invest over time in some solar panels and yacht batteries to run your sump pumps from, your costs will level out even more."
aquaponics,2htuyo,TheGreatSpaces,1 point,Mon Sep 29 23:37:11 2014 UTC,Very good write up. You are dead on for it being capital intensive. The papers I've read also brought this up and mentioned it was much harder to turn a profit with aquaponics and that hydroponics would have a better ROI
aquaponics,2htuyo,BigBudMicro,1 point,Mon Sep 29 23:53:04 2014 UTC,"Yes, hydro is much better commercially, and is simple. It does have more fertilizer inputs but it is still cheaper to run at present. I do wonder if these inputs will become more expensive over time, however, once natural gas becomes more scarce. Probably not in our working lifetimes though..."
aquaponics,2htuyo,TheGreatSpaces,0,Tue Sep 30 00:43:27 2014 UTC,"My idea is just to build a system that makes me free to work only on this. So besides the food, I would like to pay for a house and the energy, water and internet bills. I'm not being greed here, just wanna a way out of the system. My job is stressfull with no mid or long term stability. Just one or two years contracts are available. So I really want to find a sustainable way of living that doesn't require a ordinary job.  Your inputs help me thinking in some problems and possibilities. I really need to start small and get used to the job and the market.  If requires only 10 hours per week of dedicated work, I probably can work in other things at the same time, so that's a very imposrant and positive aspect that I'll take into account.   And if you invest over time in some solar panels and yacht batteries to run your sump pumps from, your costs will level out even more.   Any idea of the types of photovoltaic panels that can run a small system (like with a 1000 liters on the tank)?"
aquaponics,2htuyo,TheGreatSpaces,1 point,Tue Sep 30 09:47:09 2014 UTC,"Yeah if you're using sumps, and vertical growth media, like that commercial system from Wyoming, Agritech, (they are big on YouTube), you only need 2x 400watt  (maximum) pumps, run it for one hour on, one hour off, so 12 hours/day. That should be good for 1000 liters, which is good for 300-500 'holes'. That's half an 8m x 3m polytunnel with the vertical thingies, or a whole one if you use flat trays with rocks or whatever, and how much life you can spawn in that space depends on your climate and the insolation patterns of your particular piece of land.   The pumps are tricky, you don't need that much power but from what I could find there aren't many affordable pumps that are durable at lesser capacities, but it really Is overkill. So with that in mind, depending on how many fish you have, producing poop, and all that, you can figure out how long you are running the pumps for. Eg: 12 hours of 2 x 400 watts, =800x12, = 9.6kWhours per day. So that is like, what one person consumes in a day in a normal house. So if you have a 1000hole system, as I've proposed, you are looking at doubling your electricity consumption (compared to a couple in a small apartment/house).   So with solar, you would ideally run the pumps more in the day, when you're not home, and the sun is shining. So you might get most if the energy for free. You would just need a 3kw system to be sure... and they pay themselves off in 5-7 years these days - it's not the 90s! lol.  May I ask what state you are in? All my calculations are for 38 degrees below the equator. Also water is a big factor here..."

I am exploring the possibilities right now, but I sure will try a small scale aquaponics first. The information you provided is very helpful, cause I really don't know the energy costs of having an aquaponics system.   I think that using a 1000 L tank for the fish and with photovoltaic panels I'll have to spend ~ €1500. But I am not sure about it yet. I need to search for cheaper options.  About the fishes.

aquaponics,2htuyo,Aquaponics-Heretic,2,Tue Sep 30 13:47:56 2014 UTC,"There are 2 big mistakes I see when people are considering going commercial in aquaponics.     They haven't run a small system effectively yet.  I had a guy call me just yesterday who wanted to set up a 2 acre commercial farm.  When I asked him if he has run a small system yet he responded ""I haven't. I don't know much of anything about aquaponics.""  So he is going to come by our training center to see how small systems work and build one on his own before he goes big. They build the system before they have buyers ready to buy.  It's just not try that when you build it, they will come.  Spend some time talking to people to see what they want to buy first, get them to commit to buying and then grow it for them.  Growing is easy, selling is hard.   When going commercial, the Zip Grow towers by Bright Agrotech cut down production costs by 60% because you do live in store displays.  So there's no harvesting or packaging involved.    I interviewed Nate Storey about this very thing on this podcast: http://www.aquaponicsforeveryone.com/episode-2-the-one-with-nate-storey-about-vertical-farming/"

If you feel you would be able to accomplish that, then aquaponics would be profitable. Don't try to gauge what your success will be based upon your ability to grow. Goodluck on your endeavours!"

This kit looks pretty good value (not the one I got, looks better though):  http://www.aliexpress.com/item/20pcs-Cells-WHOLE-6x6-Solar-Cell-DIY-Solar-Panel/1563550368.html  Then you need ply and epoxy, should be able to do it for less than $100. Not too bad for 80Watt. It will only be 10v though so you'll need a voltage step up also.  To be honest my brother did the control unit, it's wayyy too fancy for me to understand.

aquaponics,2hqa16,chris7878,2,Sun Sep 28 22:35:11 2014 UTC,"We've actually made our own form of snap clamps out of pvc. Our hoop house is constucted with 3/4"" pvc, and we used 1"" pvc to make our clamps. Each clamp is about 2"" long, and we cut out and removed about a 1/4"" sliver down the length of each piece to make each clamp. Before snapping the film into place with these diy snap clamps, we put one or two strips of heavy duty tape on the parts of the film that'll make contact with the clamps.  It made for an even tighter fit and hopefully reinforces those parts to prevent tearing. I believe we used around 12 clamps on each end.  The handful of black clamps that are more visible in the picture aren't strong at all and are only being used to temporarily hold the excess film back. I dont know what they're called, but they were just in the pvc aisle of home depot and don't have a tight hold.  We're hoping our diy clamps hold up against the elements, but only time will tell.

They are used in some aquariums to start the nitrogen cycle and can even tolerate some salt in the water!  I've never heard of them being used in aquaponics but if you aren't gonna eat the little things anyway they might be worth looking into.  The only downside I can see is that in order for them too breed well you should put a small amount of plant cover near the top of the tank.  That would rob nutrients from your plants.  That said, its pretty much the case for any breeding population of fish.  Or on the other hand without plants in the tank I guess the population would control itself...  My 2c, hope it helps"

Waiting to see what happens with soaking ~500ml of them in phosphoric before I pull them out or find alternative idea's.  Most of the stuff I like to grow needs to be at ~7-7.2 PH and KH below 100mg/l.

Mostly concerned about turning my basement into a bioreactor and starting the next great black plague :)  I know tent's are sold for three reasons: odor control, light reflection, and temperature control.    A healthy AP system shouldn't smell (too much) and the plants will do some of the work of keeping the air fresher ( or covering it up better ).    Light reflection feels to me like the people who put vacuum cleaner motors on their car air intake to get more ""horses"", if you get HiD or LED lights then reflection isn't really a concern;   Temperature can/will be a problem.  In ponds & lakes, fish can descend down to avoid temporary cold snaps but AP is all above ground and generally not insulated.   To start, perhaps just get a roll of mylar to cut down on cold drafts and get some light reflection but remember to get a cheap oscillating fan to run during the day cause plant's don't do well in stagnant/still air."

aquaponics,2gpffd,Frire,1 point,Thu Sep 18 01:08:25 2014 UTC,"Thanks! Yeah, I think a frame is probably best to keep the plastic from warping.  There's about 40 goldfish in there... Maybe 5lbs?  As far as nitrates and measurement... I've never measured. I've been involved with plants for 15+years, so I read what's missing from examining the leaves. I'm pretty good at detecting chlorosis symptoms and how to steer it back on track. I've had 3 systems and had great results. However, I've never had a long term system, I always end up moving after a year and rebuilding."
aquaponics,2gpffd,Frire,2,Thu Sep 18 02:24:17 2014 UTC,"I asked about nitrates since you mentioned excess nitrates, but I guess that in the fish tank is more to give the fish something to play with?  It's hard to imagine too much nitrate."

aquaponics,2gpcgk,Obliterous,2,Wed Sep 17 22:19:32 2014 UTC,"I'm really interested in adapting a wicking grow bed to an aquaponics loop as a more ideal bed for crops that don't do well in artificial media.  If you circulated the fish water through the water reservoir, which wicks up to the soil above, I think you'd have a much more stable growing environment.  It would also be better for root crops, potatoes, etc.  It's hard finding much info on this though."
aquaponics,2gpcgk,JimJalinsky,1 point,Thu Sep 18 00:09:26 2014 UTC,"on phone  so can't find the link, aquaponic nation forum has several wicking bed proponents on there.  what I have seen,  a wicking might only be filled up once a week and i haven't seen a demonstration of one incorporated into the loop,  it's more of a nutrient sink then a component."
aquaponics,2gpcgk,zynix,1 point,Thu Sep 18 06:54:07 2014 UTC,"Actually, I think it's both.  The media used for the water reservoir would act as a bio filter if the water circulated through it as part of the AP loop.  It's also a nutrient sink in that the water would be slowly absorbing into the soil above the reservoir.  I'll take a look at AP Nation, thanks!"
aquaponics,2gpcgk,JimJalinsky,1 point,Thu Sep 18 18:50:28 2014 UTC,"Fairly similar ( if not a rose by any other name ) are ""dual zone"" aquaponic systems and more exotic is aquaponic fruit tree systems ( http://theaquaponicsource.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Steve_Raisner-Aquaponic_Fruit_Trees.pdf ).  I attended that presentation and the entire time I was thinking ""This is basically a wicking bed in a barrel""  Dual zone is fairly nifty, you put a pot of soil on top of a media bed, drill holes in the bottom, put hydroponic media in the bottom, and half bury the pot in the bed.   The idea is to feed the soil nutrients ( eg something in same vein but less scary as Miracle grow ) just enough to feed the plant but not leach into the bed.  Meanwhile once the plant develops, it gets water and nitrates by having roots grow into the bed."
aquaponics,2gpcgk,zynix,1 point,Thu Sep 18 19:07:55 2014 UTC,"Very interesting. I don't get why you would want a flood and drain mechanism with a wicking bed.  It seems to me that circulating water through the reservoir at  constant height (adjustable to within a inch or so of the soil above) would better.  Another thing that could benefit the overall system is placing air stones at the bottom of the media in the wicking water reservoir.  In this way, you are helping to oxygenate the water for your AP system, and the air would partially make it's way up through the soil above increasing aeration there too.  Not sure it if would work out, but it sounds plausible."
aquaponics,2gpcgk,JimJalinsky,1 point,Thu Sep 18 19:26:57 2014 UTC,"I don't get why you would want a flood and drain mechanism with a wicking bed.    Some plants just can't handle the amount of water a DWC/constant height system provides.  With fruiting trees especially, they're like horses and will literally eat/drink themselves to death.  Another issue is that constant height with media can create bacterial slime dead zones that will kill an AP system.  DWC gets around this as it has sediment filters and the water is moving ( slowly but it is moving ) a lot faster then if there was media to collect sediment and slime.   Another thing that could benefit the overall system is placing air stones at the bottom of the media in the wicking water reservoir.   Checkout bubbleponics ( I thought someone was joking when they said that), its a cheaper solution then aeroponics at some efficiency losses.  I've seen an odd recirculating AP system where buckets with net pots hold plants and system water is run from a reservoir, through the buckets in a timed fashion ( it wasn't AP tho )."

aquaponics,2gnblu,froschkonig,3,Wed Sep 17 16:45:50 2014 UTC,"The bacterial biofilms in an established setup take care of molds quite well. I've only ever seen mold in systems with really bad filtration. In this case the mold is outside the system sitting on a piece of ceramic, so I wouldn't be worried. If those spores fall, they will be dealt with.   Having a fish tank or aquaponics setup is primarily about farming bacteria, not fish or plants."
aquaponics,2gnblu,froschkonig,1 point,Wed Sep 17 17:47:55 2014 UTC,"This is the first time I've had this problem, and it's because the system has been malfunctioning a bit (the siphon hasn't had enough flow to kickstart it for some reason), so I'm guessing there's some sort of correlation. Worst case scenario, could this mould/mold spread to all my plants and damage my fish? It's possible some spores are spreading in deeper parts of the grow bed (which are submerged often)."
aquaponics,2gnblu,Tiborik,1 point,Wed Sep 17 19:36:25 2014 UTC,Mold needs moisture and some light to grow. Try to keep the top layer of hydroton dry and the mold issues should stop.

For under $100, you'll have to stick to cost effective materials such as cinder blocks for your grow bed stand, Rubbermaid tubs for the grow bed and tank (you can find cheap used aquariums online or any fish store, but it won't be as cheap as a tub), and gravel from home Depot ($3 for 50 lbs).

If you run this system indoors, it would have been ideal if no pests entered at any point. If you run it outdoors, there are plenty of predator mites and wasps you can use to control them that will have no effect on your fish. The key here would balancing the populations. There are also lots of possible sprays/bacterial/fungal options that you can use but you must ensure that whatever you use will have zero effect on fish. Just because something doesn't harm us, it doesn't mean it won't harm fish.   Also ensure that all pest control programs are approved by your municipality."

aquaponics,2gh9uz,richcreations,1 point,Mon Sep 15 19:51:57 2014 UTC,Thanks! I'm just frustrated at the lack of plant growth and thought that the pH was to blame. Bernstein has a chart that shows nutrients absorbed within a certain pH and she says that if you keep the pH between such and such you should never have to add anything. I'll do a partial water change and put some more goldfish in when it's stable. Hopefully it will go better in the bigger system.. I mainly want salad and it looks like that grows better with the roots directly in the water. Really if I can't keep basil and mint going I feel like it's not working.
aquaponics,2gh9uz,richcreations,1 point,Mon Sep 15 20:16:08 2014 UTC,"I grow lettuce, and basil in a grow bed in my kitchen window, from a 10 gallon tank, my bed is continuous flow, and I really had to put a lot of fish in tank before the plants grew well (20+ zebra danios in a 10G). You will have to add iron.   I actually use the fertilizers I use in in my planted aquariums, aquavitro is the brand, I use the iron, and micros weekly, and dose nitrogen and phosphates as needed to keep the levels up (mostly only needed when plants are getting big).  If you are ever testing 0 nitrates or phosphates, that would explain your slow growth, you prob need a lot more fish, and need to feed them more. Or you can supplement like I do.  EDIT: my basil plant is 3' tall, and happy, lettuce grows explosively."
aquaponics,2gh9uz,zynix,1 point,Mon Sep 15 20:34:17 2014 UTC,In the past I was told that was too many goldfish for 20 gal. I don't have anything to test for phosphates. But I don't think I've ever tested 0 nitrates once the system was established. Thanks for the tips. Very different perspective than what I've gotten in the past. Can't argue with 3' basil
aquaponics,2gh9uz,richcreations,1 point,Mon Sep 15 20:58:15 2014 UTC,"In the past I was told that was too many goldfish for 20 gal.    Someone else on /r/aquaponics has pointed out that ""rules"" like 1lb/2-4 gallon are more like guidelines.  I still use a ratio of 1:3 lb/gallon as a guide but it also depends on how well developed the ecosystem of various bacteria ( nitrosomonas, Streptomyces, and nitrobactor being the more important ) has become.    Furthermore for media bed's, the media itself becomes important as they influence how much bacteria can colonize in the system.  Too little bacteria limits how much Ammonia/NH3 can be processed.  In the tad more technical, borderline useless info for small system, only about 30% of NH3 ends up as Nitrate."

aquaponics,2gh9uz,Aquaponics-Heretic,1 point,Tue Sep 16 18:43:24 2014 UTC,I was thinking more like 20-30ppm...   That would be an acceptable buffer....  Elevated nitrates can certainly be an issue (around that level) for ova/fry.. especially for some species (such as rainbow Trout)...  But the literature suggests that most growth stages of fish can tolerate levels up to 450ppm+ (Bluegill).... unless for prolonged periods...  And you just shouldn't have an aquaponics system exhibiting nitrate levels above 100ppm for any length of time.. it suggests a complete imbalance in your system... (and wasted nutrient resources)

I have been going by the book as best I can. I added a teaspoon of lime to bring the pH back up and had no idea that so little would affect it so much.. particularly when what seemed like extreme amounts of vinegar didn't change the pH at all. And, yes, Bernstein says not to try to adjust the pH with additives but with all my plants dying repeatedly what am I supposed to do? You can see in this thread that there is little agreement as to the proper procedure. I can read books and forums all day long, but until I get a system up and running and encounter the ensuing difficulties and troubleshoot, I'm not going to really understand the process. I believe it was something in the sock solids filter that caused the die off. Clearly a mistake now, but the two socks I used before didn't seem to cause any problems. Same feet. Same laundry. Obviously I am going to build a different solids filter now. But the sock works for other people with small systems"

I also promise to first use the backyard aquaponics forum to better understand the complexities of water chemistry. But just so we're clear; in case anybody else is reading this post to carelessly glean information and further tarnish the Old World perfection that was aquaponics before Americans set their filthy, uncouth hands upon it; and for all my sadist brothers who strive to go beyond Mengle and Unit 731 to simply celebrate suffering on Facebook and Youtube without the burden of knowledge gained:    Bernstein does not advocate the use of vinegar or anything else to change the pH. She has a chart that shows what nutrients can be taken in under certain pH, which I thought of as another way of saying ""for best results keep your pH between 6.5 and 7"" I simply misunderstood that as an instruction and went searching on the web for ways to first raise, then lower my pH. I looked at my records last night and the nitrates had in fact fallen off (registering a 0 on my API kit) the past few weeks-- I probably didn't notice because I was so concerned with the pH. Last night Nitrates, Nitrites, and Ammonia were all 0s and pH was 6 (or bottom of my scale, could be lower). My seedlings are actually doing better now, dark green color and growing true leaves whereas before they were stunted. I'm changing as much water as I can at once (~90%). Also, there were suds on top of the water leading me to suspect the sock."

Sadly, most (with the exception of the more ""learned"" US members who cut their teeth on the prior forums)... seemed unaware of the pre-exisiting forums and wealth of information  And set about ""reinventing the wheel"" based on other information means.. or more often than not ""misinformation"" presented by those other means  My comments about Bernstein relate to material she has published (and never corrected) about nitrification, specifically the cause of pH decline... and carbonate hardness  The chart she uses concerning trace element availability vs pH... is like most of the other information in her ""book""... taken from posts on the pre-exisiting forums  My comments weren't meant as a reflection on ""Americans""...

I do think there are a couple niches that haven't been looked into, lots of local areas (like mine) where nobody else is doing it, and obviously huge swaths of the population that haven't been reached but might have an interest under the right circumstances.    Aquaponics is a lifestyle change, or a lifestyle investment.  In other words, it's a Porshe not a Corolla.  The sort of thing that people need to see in action, mull over for a while, let it seep into their pores before they're ready to try it.  The diffusion of innovations curve is still very much in the early adopter / bleeding edge period, at least in most of North America.  Plenty of people in the game, but the dust has barely been stirred up, much less settled.  Yeah, blogs, books, all that.  I know the drill.  First step is a brand.    The pixie dust and guru BS is just shooting yourself in the ass long-term.    For instance, solar water heaters are a great idea, but in the 70s everybody and their uncle said ""hire me I'm a solar water heater installer/expert"" and they soured the industry for 20 years till people started to realize ""you know those guys were idiots but this is actually a good idea.""

Only problem is that it diffuses light so well it will make your sun-loving plants leggy. Its AMAZING for shade-tolerant plants, like greens.

For three.. you would have to ask the goldie people, but bigger than 55G that is for sure.    Goldies really aren't beginner fish and almost ALL 'Cheap' fish come with extensive care requirements.  Goldies have extensive care requirements for all sorts of reasons.  Putting one in a 2 or 3 gallon tank is very cruel.  They will grow to actually be bigger than the volume of water in that container given conditions where they will live long enough to do so.    I totally understand that no one is doing this to be intentional cruel.. but cruel it is none-the-less.

Bacterial infections happen because of stress on the fish - poor water quality or rapid pH, hardness, or temperature changes, etc.  There's LOTS of info on raising goldfish online.  They're probably the easiest fish to raise, but they are definitely not indestructible and will die without stable, quality, aerated water."

They treat them rather like buying florist's flowers or orchids, that they toss later and replace. Now, I think that's not a good thing; however, I am not a vegetarian, and I actually go fishing and kill fish (and worms) outright, so I clearly have some moral ambiguity going on myself.  The problem is that it's very hard to talk to people who are essentially killing their pets and help them see a better way. It depends on how receptive they are. Usually they are hostile to the idea that they don't know what they're doing and that they're killing the fish. And AFAIK, Peta, Animal Cruelty laws, etc don't get involved over these goldfish bowls or even larger poorly-kept tanks.  It's most likely inadequate water changes, plus inadequate oxygenation, that's killing these fish, though it could also be a bacterium in the bowl, or malnutrition/issues from poor feeding or overfeeding. If said lady would sterilize the bowl and then regularly do water changes and put a bubbler in her bowl and feed high-quality food properly, the fish would do very well. BUT then they'll actually survive, and very rapidly grow WAAAYYY too large for the bowl. (Which will mess up her ""display"", and is only like 2 weeks of un-stunted growth for those fry.) You could try asking if she'd like help with water changes, or if she'd like you to add a (gentle!) bubbler. And then when the fish start to become giant, see what happens then....  Really, I have a very good friend who is a wonderful woman who also does this goldfish-in-a-bowl thing, while I likewise keep my goldfish in a 40g planted tank at my home. I commented once that hers would eventually get wayyyy too big for the bowl, as they're comet goldfish fry, and she basically thought I was an idiot, flippantly saying, ""No, you buy these small guys, and they last a few weeks and they die and that's how they are."" Sigh. What to do?  I think a very good idea is to get her to keep a betta instead. They are gorgeous and personable, much happier in a goldfish-bowl situation than goldfish actually are, and will never grow too big. You could suggest this idea tactfully, like a friend had recommended a better type of fish for those bowls, that are gorgeous and less trouble and don't keep dying all the time..."

But yeah, it's a little involved for small feeder goldfish.  The most I've done is fix water quality issues and treat for ich and bacterial infections in a separate tank from my main one.  The sick one will very likely die, but whatever killed it will probably kill the others too in a matter of time if it's not dealt with.  It's unfortunate - goldfish are probably the most mistreated animal that we keep as pets.  People get them at fairs or pet stores and expect them to survive after being thrown in a small glass bowl with no aeration.  They're hardy fish and will last a few days, but without a properly sized and cycled tank they'll die within a week or so.  Edit - Good to see the owner does take care of them."

aquaponics,2g14tw,Tiborik,3,Wed Sep 10 19:05:00 2014 UTC,"I'm doing it on a smaller scale. When I built my (soil) grow beds, I put in spent mushroom logs to do hugelkultur. My system is outdoors in Phoenix, AZ, so i assumed any mushrooms still in there would get baked out. I was wrong. When last fall hit, i got several flushes of both oyster and black poplar mushrooms. In another month or so, I'm going to build a mushroom grow bed from scratch.   As for compost, the drain from my tank dumps onto a kitty litter bucket with the bottoms cut off and 1"" holes drilled in the sides. I don't put kitchen waste in there because i don't want the nitrogen spike, but i do put in spent plants. The combination of dead plants and solid waste from the fish makes pretty good compost. It is probably semi-aerobic. The bin is subject to flood/drain and the worms love it, but the particle size is small, so it doesn't breathe very well."
aquaponics,2g14tw,dirt_ed,2,Wed Sep 10 23:08:50 2014 UTC,That is the scale I'm thinking on. Those mushrooms are perfect for a hugulkultur garden. What do you have in mind for those grow beds? Shape/design? Sticking with oysters and poplars? Woodchip substrate?   Are you using a bucket like this - http://www.freetailtherapy.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/scoopable-cat-litter.jpg  Sounds like that would turn out semi-aerobic. Pretty cool. I'd love to see a picture if you had any.   Do you get flies around your oysters?
aquaponics,2g14tw,dirt_ed,1 point,Thu Sep 11 03:08:05 2014 UTC,"Yep, that's the bucket. I'm actually going to try a different mushroom. I'm going with king stropharia. Its a more soil-based mushroom that does really well in woodchip beds and filters water very well. It is also an active consumer of bacteria. I'm a bit worried about how well it will do in the heat, but i guess I'll find out. Oysters (i prefer elm oysters) would probably do well, too. Black poplars are tricky, but delicious.  My bed is a simple rectangular bed, 4'x2'x8"". It has a drain in the bottom. No siphon because they wouldn't really work in a soil bed, and wouldn't be needed anyway.  No flies on the oysters. Either i picked them and ate them or they dried out. It isn't humid enough here for them to rot out in the open."
aquaponics,2g14tw,dirt_ed,1 point,Thu Sep 11 04:00:19 2014 UTC,"I had not considered how dry it is there. I'm in NJ.  Stropharia is a good choice. Dry heat will always work against your mushrooms. But since your soil will be plenty wet, you'll get a lot of evaporative cooling. I would build a ventilated hoop over that bed.  Did the poplars give you trouble?   Do you know how you're going to pipe your mushroom bed into the system? I'm assuming your feed will be from the plant beds, but intravenously."
aquaponics,2g14tw,ColdWeatherAquaponic,1 point,Thu Sep 11 05:15:20 2014 UTC,"Now that I am at a keyboard, it is a little easier to point you to pictures. I am a little busy lately and haven't been posting as often as I would like, but here is my blog. The most recent couple of posts have a photo of my system.   Being soil, the wicking and evaporative cooling you get is a lot less than the surface area for heat absorption. Last year my water temperature hit 100 degrees by mid June. From what I hear, coolers for your water are very expensive, so I built the cheap version. Mine is a CHOP system. When the water drains back into the sump tank, it drains out a bar with a bunch of individual holes. I have an old t-shirt draped over that bar, and a fan sitting on top of the bar blowing down. As the water drains into the tank, it drains through the shirt. The moving air evaporates water from the large surface area, cooling the shirt. The rest of the water passing through is cooled by the shirt. It takes off about 10 degrees from the water. My bed never got over about 92 last year or this since I installed that.  Incidently, I think that my cooler is the reason the mushrooms survived. As I mentioned, the soil picks up heat. The chilled water moving through it cools it back off. In the summer, I run the system longer at night than during the day so that the relatively cool temps will have more cooling effect.   Any hoop I built over the bed would have to be tall. My tomatoes are over three feet. My eggplant is about that as well. My okra is four feet and climbing. I planted corn, but it seems to be putting out tassles at about 6"" tall, so that's probably a no-go.  As for the piping, the water comes out of the tank via a riser on the back of the tank. From there, I have a horizontal pipe set at the water height I want on the tank. That runs out to both beds and is just split between them. I have a valve on the smaller bed so I can control the flow. Right now I have a window box tray set into the side of the bed. The water dumps into there first and then overflows to the rest of the bed. The tray is there to hold water constantly so I can grow water chestnuts. Since it catches the solid waste from the fish, I muck it out every now and then. However, oddly enough, that tray attracts a lot of worms. They seem to like the fish waste and don't mind living in water to get at it. I keep trying to put Malaysian trumpet snails in there to do the same job, but they don't seem to live very long."

aquaponics,2g14tw,theaquaponicguy,1 point,Thu Sep 11 23:50:26 2014 UTC,"I went through a number of your blog posts and they are very interesting, not to mention motivational.  You are doing a lot of wonderful experiments.  I look forward to future posts.  Water coolers would be prohibitively expensive, yes.  I like your cooling system.  It sounds like something I would have built.  An additional cooling method could be a crude geothermal setup.  Use a fence-post hole digger to get a few feet down.  Draw water through a small aquarium pump down there and it would recirculate cooler.  Some metal heatsink somewhere towards the bottom might increase effectiveness.  The worms moved in on their own?  Did they come through the piping from the soil beds?  A question about your plant beds.  It seems like you have the water entering, not directly onto the soil surface, but beside it.  Your soil is sitting on what looks to me like a thin foam mat.  Is this correct?  My guess is that this allows a comparatively freer flow of water underneath the soil.  Have you considered a thin base layer of gravel?  Soil would inevitably fill in the gaps for the most part, but not quite with that foam barrier.  Maybe your climate is hot/dry enough that root saturation is not a big issue.  I'm imagining your system here and I can't stop seeing root rot."
aquaponics,2g14tw,dirt_ed,1 point,Wed Sep 17 01:38:29 2014 UTC,"Thanks for the compliments! It is always nice to hear. Alas, life has been pretty horrifically busy of late, but I will get back to posting one of these days. I am certainly not lacking for things to talk about.  If I remember correctly, if you get 5' deep (or is it 10?) the soil temperature is the average air temperature of your area. Just guessing here, but that would probably still put it around 80. I mean, it barely drops below 100 for 4 months straight. Not sure I would get a lot of cooling action.  The pot with the water chestnuts is buried most of the way in a soil bed, so the worms just climbed the sides on their own.  I originally had the water dump directly onto the soil through a distributed bar, but the holes kept clogging from the fish solid waste. Then I just had it dump from an open hole directly onto the soil.  Now I have a compost at the end to catch the fish waste, but most of the water exits the pipe along the side of the pipe, and dumps directly onto the soil. It actually becomes a very alive area. The the worms like the fish waste and swarm the location every night.   The barrier is not foam. It is landscape fabric, and I put it there to filter the small particles from the water so they don't plug the drain. The drain for the big bed is down low, so it will drain completely. The drain for the little bed is low on the side, so it retains an inch or so of water. However, with 8"" of soil, the plants can easily just not grow their roots into the saturated soil. For the most part, the plants get moist, well-drained soil.   I think root rot would certainly be an issue if it didn't drain better. I have run the system on constant flow for a week or so at a time to clear certain issues, and it doesn't seem to harm the plants. I think that root rot would be a bigger problem if the water was stangnant and low in oxygen.   That said, certainly some plants do better than others. I have had poor luck with peppers. I have my first several eggplant plants, and they are growing well, but producing poorly. Ginger didnt' grow well. The corn I just planted is already setting tassels and it is only a foot tall. Squash grows up big enough to produce one squash and then rots. Spinach did poorly as well. On the other hand, water spinach and its close relative, sweet potato, are doing amazingly well. Okra is thriving. Other than the summer's heat, tomatoes do very well. Onions, beets, purslane, lettuce, dill, cilantro, lemongrass, and chard are all very productive. I am sure that could be due to various factors, like summer heat, pests, nutrient loads, etc."
aquaponics,2g14tw,theaquaponicguy,3,Thu Sep 18 03:47:17 2014 UTC,"I like the way you think sir. Anaerobic zones are great for making certain nutrients like iron available to our plants. I'd be interested in exploring how to contain them in an aquaponic system without any negative effects.  Another ""system"" you could branch out in is incorporating various types of aquatic life (freshwater clams, cherry shrimp, plecostomus) to achieve different roles. That's something I might be playing around with later....."

Probably added to the growbeds or sump to avoid a significant DO drop in the fish tank.  I have a personal attachment to bivalves.  The thought of incorporating them makes me smile :)  Benefits would be that they will feed passively, are tasty, and no-maintenance.  Costs are basically just tank room and a small amount of otherwise plant food.  I like it.  What do you have in mind right now?"

aquaponics,2fzv8y,TheSecretMe,5,Wed Sep 10 11:15:08 2014 UTC,"In my limited experience the ""meh"" part is pretty accurate, AFTER your system is established. I built a 250 gallon system and for a few months it was daily testing, tweaking, planting, pulling, moving. Now everything is stable enough that I have to check my PH every now and then or it drops too low, and I have to feed the fish. Other than that I just let it go, my Nitrates are high but not high enough to cause any harm and I can't squeeze any more plants in so there's nothing to do about that. Just feed the fish daily, harvest stuff. Some seaweed extract every few weeks for any deficiencies. Once you have a stable system and figure out what works for you, it feels pretty easy. For me anyway."
aquaponics,2fzv8y,Whittigo,4,Wed Sep 10 14:44:56 2014 UTC,"Just a few brief notes you might find interesting.     You can change the nutrient levels in aquaponics by feeding more per plant and also by allowing some denitrification to take place. Not really necessary with leafy greens but can help with fruit production.   Once nice thing about aquaponics is that your system is full of 'beneficial' bacteria. This makes it more difficult for pathogenic bacteria to gain a foothold in your system (compared to hydro).   Aquaponics is more risky compared to hydro because of the fish. If the fish get sick or die you can have big problems, and they are the most complicated part of the whole thing. It is very difficult to use any type of pesticide in aquaponics, which is great for the food you eat, but can make production MUCH more difficult.   With both hyrdo and aquaponics it easier to grow similar plants, that is plants that require similar nutrients, in the same system since you can't really allocate nutrients once they are dissolved in the water. This may seem obvious but you would be surprised about many people come on here wondering why their basil is growing fine but their tomatoes wont fruit.     I'm not sure entirely what you were asking but hopefully this illustrates a few of the nuances of aquaponcis vs hydroponics."

Not only do you need to be perfect in your measurements, but now we have a huge cabinet full of powders and mixes. So all of that takes up space, requires MSDSs (because I'm cranky like that) and a book full of measurements and charts. True, it allows us to tune the water to a few of our plants, but while a few varieties flourish some of them are growing too fast while others are barely making it. Tuning the mix to one plant fouls up the whole rest of the farm and we can't break them into sections because the system was designed for fish, not a cabinet of chemicals.  And the algae. Oh sweet lord the algae. I spend more time cleaning filters, scrubbing scrubbing the system, and scraping algae buildup than I do prepping for market deliveries. I've never seen an aqua set up with this much slime. On top of that all the hardware that comes out of the system needs to be bleached and properly rinsed before it can go back in or the problem gets worse."
aquaponics,2fzv8y,WonkoTheSane__,3,Wed Sep 10 13:05:13 2014 UTC,"With hydro there is so little room for error. At least growing ""indoor plants"". You have yo clean your res once a week.

Aquaponics may be easier."
aquaponics,2fzv8y,Alacritous,3,Wed Sep 10 12:10:35 2014 UTC,I'm trying to figure out what makes the difference though. In both systems you're pumping nutrient loaded water past your plant roots.  So why does there seem to be so much more margin for error in aqua systems?
aquaponics,2fzv8y,pooppate,2,Wed Sep 10 12:12:37 2014 UTC,"ITs not that one is easier than the other, it all has to do with allocation of time.  Aquaponics requires a lot of setup time, even for a basic system.  For instance it took me probably about 150 to 200 hours to build my aquaponics setup (250 Gallon Setup).  But once it was setup and I cycled it, the hard work stopped.  There are some minor maintenance things you need to do, but over all, day after day, its just not much work.  Hydroponics, which is where I started my exploration, is super easy to set up, all you need is a air pump, a 5 gall bucket and a net pot (This is for a very basic setup).  Seriously can be that basic.  The difference is every single day I was testing every plant.  I had to check PH balance, all the time and then figure out what to do to bring it back into an optimal range.  I also had to clean my system, like complete clean, about once a week.  It gets to be a lot of work.  SO setup may have taken about an hour or two, including buying supplies, but my daily allocation of time to maintain was probably about 2-3 hours a day.  The biggest difference in fertilizer that I saw, is when I was doing Hydro I was using non organic at first but then switched to organic. What I noticed is that when you are using Organic fertilizers you dont have to be as exact.  Your plants will absorb what they can, but will not be toooooooo badly damaged by over fertilizing.  IF you are using non organic a little to much or a little to little can have drastic effects.     From my personal experience I would say that these are two methods of growing food that are for the dedicated, and who want to spend a decent amount of their time doing this hobby.  I love it, would spend 18 hours a day doing this if I did not have to... you know earn a living."

Call this 'slow and steady'. Very stable. Hydroponics usually introduces more nutrients all at once. This 'big and fast' type of loading is inherently less stable. Type of system matters also. Deep Water Raft basically makes your system into a big thermal and chemical battery that takes a lot to change. This can be a disadvantage, but it is stable. At least that is my understanding.

Relying on well established processes of nature to get a job done always takes a load off of the grower, in my mind."

Eventually, though, you do get to a point of equilibrium where all you have to do is remove solids.  At that point aquapoincs grows faster."

aquaponics,2fzv8y,ColdWeatherAquaponic,1 point,Wed Sep 10 16:05:17 2014 UTC,"Ok that makes sense.  Thanks!  Basically I'm the type of person who's not looking to maximize outputs, but to minimize inputs.  I'll always try and spend less money before I try and make more.  I'm okay with slower plant growth if I don't have to spend much time at it.  Having applied that philosophy to both hydroponics and aquaponics, I've found that both can be operated with very little maintenance, though hydroponics is easier in my experience.    I ran a hydro system with zero testing, water/nutrient changes every 2 months, and it worked.  I now run an aquaponics system in which I have to feed the fish daily (though I can go on vacation for two weeks and leave them without food) and check pH every two weeks.  I used to check ammonia/nitrates but I've found I don't need to anymore, except maybe once in early spring.  Besides planting and harvesting (and occasionally draining solids), that's it.  Both very low-maintenance, but hydro is lower.  Aquaponics grows faster once the system has established its nutrient levels and reached equilibrium, based on three studies I've read (or read about).  I've got two of them listed here.  I don't know if these hydro system competitions were incorporating the new bacteria-and-fungal-intensive hydro techniques I've been reading about, though.   It's not removing solids that makes it grow faster.  You're right - that wasn't clear.  Removing solids allows you to stabilize your system.  Leaving the solids in (even in media beds) in my experience eventually causes instability and/or persistently and excessively high nitrate levels.    This is all backyard, of course, and only my experience (and a couple studies)."

I've said it before.. and demonstrated it consistently (as have others)... that you just don't need any where near the levels of fish stocking density.. that is often proposed, or implemented...  Growing lots of plants in aquaponics is easy... growing lots of fish isn't...  If you want to grow lots of fish... design your system from a RAS perspective... and implement the hydroponic component, and/or nutrient supplementation accordingly... in separate loops   Removing solids allows you to stabilize your system.   It indeed does.. if your stocking density requires it...

The current greenhouse has been a fantastic proof of concept since construction in march. As winter approaches I am exploring cheap methods of supplementing heat.   Ultimately I would like to build a very well planned and year round aquaponics system that doesn't destroy the bank account. ;) As i dink around with this stuff i am finding that I might need a multiprong approach which combines a couple different and very inexpensive methods of heating.   Until it gets cold all i can do is run some numbers and make some ballpark guesses. When the ice bears down on denver i'll get the real lessons."
aquaponics,2fxgvr,jksamswed,2,Wed Sep 10 01:24:56 2014 UTC,"Temperatures stay pretty constant at around 8 ft deep in the ground. It is something like 50-60 degrees F if I remember right. People use this concept to keep their heating and cooling costs down since they get to start at a temperature that is more reasonable than 100 or -10 degrees F.   I'm not sure if 3 F of depth is going to do much. Did you get your design from somewhere that has done this before? If you have more info than I do, I'd love to know about this information."
aquaponics,2fxgvr,pudgymennonite,2,Wed Sep 10 02:39:08 2014 UTC,"There are examples all over the place, this is certainly smaller, but I am only working with a small greenhouse with limited expectations (keep it above 32F). I plan on insulating the box with R10 foamboard and adding a black cloth cover with plastic film over that with ~2inches air gap on the top surface.   A number of the systems i have seen have depths of 18-24 inches. The idea is not to reach ""constant temperature soils"" the goal is to use the thermal mass of the soil to store and release daily heat. Hot Wet air is drawn down into relatively cooler soils which, along with good old convection/conduction, causes water to condense out of the air onto the pipes. This condensation and convection/conduction releases much heat into the soil. The more soil you have the more resistance there is to warming up/cooling down.   my napkin calculation for the storage capacity of 1.75 tons of wet soil is 2,348,760J per degree C of soil temp change. That value is derived from the 1480J/kg DegC of damp soil  .Right now the exhaust temperature is ~87F (this morning it was 65F)   more napkin math and some assumptions.. 87F is ~30C (my dirt is 30C?) if, on a cold night it cools to 10C that is a difference of 20C or 46975200Joules of energy loss.   46975200J/43200seconds (12 hours)= 1087Watts or about 3700 BTUs/hr  granted that wattage output is average over the 12 hour time period and would follow a exponential decay curve with maximum heat being discharged early. I don't know the math for thermal conductivity of damp soils so the decay curve is a mystery to me at this time.  If anyone wants to double check the math I can point you at the formulas and constants i used."

aquaponics,2fxgvr,Morganross,1 point,Sun Sep 14 03:18:03 2014 UTC,"Using air bubbles is a good way to do the heat exchange. If you stick a tube into the bottom of the water and that tube has a cap on it and you have drilled a bunch of little holes in it, this will create a lot of little bubbles and the temperature will be exchanged almost immediately. You could also look into large air stones used for aquariums as a possible route. Just got to make sure that the amount of air you are pumping in can be pushed through the air stone reasonably.

Keeps everything effortlessly clean. And having your drain pipe entering the water at a 45degree angle will significantly reduce splashing. You can even have the pipe submerged to significantly quiet the drainage as long and there's a venting hole or two above the water to end the siphon.

That can choke out the stuff you're trying to grow, and will have an impact on your nitrogen cycle.

If you put some of your water in a jar with some GrowStone, I'd be curious how high the alkalinity/hardness goes after, say, 12 hours.  And how much acid it would takes to bring it down.  That might give you scale model to determine if you'll ever get your pH down or if it's permanently stuck.  From their literature:   Preparation  Being made from recycled glass, Growstones have an initial high pH.  Preparation prior to use requires time in contact with water to lower  and stabilize the solution pH.   Instructions For first time use, open the bag at the top and poke  small holes at the bottom. Insert a water hose and let drain for a few  minutes. Place the wet Growstones in a large container and fill with  tap water until covered. Let soak for about a day. Discard the soak  water and rinse thoroughly. For best results soak again overnight.  Discard water in the garden. Now your Growstones are ready to use.

aquaponics,2fvegq,jodunc88,6,Tue Sep 9 02:55:19 2014 UTC,"Yellow leaves with green veins are the symptoms of an iron deficiency or a magnesium deficiency. Iron deficiencies show up in the newer leaves first, not the older ones. Magnesium deficiencies, however, show up in the older leaves first. This is because magnesium is a mobile nutrient, so your plant can reallocate it to support new growth, while iron is an immobile nutrient.  I would say you have a magnesium deficiency. You can add epsom salt (magnesium sulfate) directly to your system water or you can treat your plants with a foliar spray (1 tbsp of epsom salt to one gallon of water, then spray on your plant leaves). A foliar spray will give you faster results. Just don't spray when your growlights are in their ""on"" cycle. The water magnifies the light and will burn your plants; give them time to dry."

I hadn't noticed a difference, so maybe it just needs regular dosing? Any recommendations on dosage for 30-35 gallons of water?"
aquaponics,2fvegq,theaquaponicguy,3,Tue Sep 9 19:21:03 2014 UTC,"I'd add about 15-30ppm worth of magnesium to your system. Let's do the math real quick. Ppm = mg/l, so one miligram of epsom salt per liter of water would give you 1ppm of epsom salt. Epsom salt is about 9.9%, let's round it to 10% magnesium, so you'll need 10mg of epsom salt per liter of water to get 1ppm of magnesium. To get 15ppm you'll need 150mg of epsom salt per liter of water. Now let's do our conversions:  35 gallons of water = 132.5 liters approx.  150mg of epsom salt per liter x 132.5 liters = 19,875 mg of epsom salt  19,875 mg converted to ounces = .7 ounces of epsom salt for 15ppm (which for me came out to around 2 tbsp.)  So, 2 tbsps of epsom salt for 15ppm in a 35 gallon system. Since the magnesium distributes itself through all your system water, you'll need to total all the water, not just the fish tank. But that's a rough estimate of what you'll need."

aquaponics,2fu7qt,the_arcatan,6,Mon Sep 8 20:11:39 2014 UTC,"Alan Bernstein ( husband to Sylvia Bernstein ) in his bell syphon howto/theory talk stated that a syphon stops when air comes up from the drain pipe due to a weakening of the vacuum inside the bell ( air is pulled into the sides of the bell until the vacuum fails enough for air to come up the drain pipe and break the vacuum entirely ).  So if you add 20' onto your bell syphon it WILL not stop as its extremely difficult for air to travel down that length, up the drain, and break the vacuum.  Thankfully there's a fantastically simple solution http://imgur.com/uw6PBMf  Put the T as close as possible after your 90 degree bend on the syphon done drain, and then start with a longer pipe either leave it long or cut it down in 1' to 6"" blocks until short enough to your needs.  The vertical pipe should not flood ( if it is, something is wrong ) and will provide a way for the syphon to break it vacuum.  Unfortunately I don't have pictures but I tried this with a 1/2"" system, 30 gallons of water, and a 50' garden hose while experimenting with bell syphon ideas.  Without the T, the syphon never stopped, with the T it stopped quickly after water reached the bottom of the bed.

Translating that to AP, perhaps a NFT lattice/ladder approach could be a compromise between the efficiency of DWC but the versatility of media beds?

aquaponics,2fu7qt,columnmn,1 point,Tue Sep 9 16:00:47 2014 UTC,"Disclaimer:  I admit this theory goes against common knowledge ( literally every youtube video and public domain document I've read ) and I'm only relaying a combination of my own experiments and claims made by Alan Bernstein who's the bell syphon guy at Aquaponic Source.   When I get the chance, I'd like to make a side-cut system to see exactly ( and therefore verify ) these but for now I am hard pressed given my own experiments not to believe this is how a bell syphon actually works.   Professionally I've always been skeptical of anything until verified by me or a source I trust [ I've read Sylvia Bernstein's book and find a lot of their videos/blog material inciteful but its hard to accept heresy :)  ].  Bell syphon operation breakage:  Adding a straight 1'-2' foot pipe after the 90 degree turn on the drain pipe, a syphon will become unreliable in how it stops.   Adding 20' of pipe would definitely make it harder for the bell to stop as air has to travel from the end of the pipe, along the top of this long horizontal run until it breaks the syphon vacuum at the turn.  The stop gaps/holes at bottom of the bell itself lets air into the top of the bell but that won't break the vacuum entirely, instead it raises the air pressure, weakening the syphon's ability to lift water up from the floor of the bed and down the drain pipe.  Actual syphon breaking happens when the amount of water going down the drain is low enough for air to travel from the end of the drain and up the pipe, and into the bell chamber.  Snorkels ( external tubes ) can help break the syphon as they allow for more air to enter the bell, raising the bell chamber pressure and making it easier for air to run up the drain.  Small hole's on the top of the bell act like a pressure regulator, limiting the amount of vacuum that can develop in the top of the bell BUT not ensuring it will break.   Limiting vacuum will cut into the speed that water can be drained as well, making it easier for air to travel up the drain pipe and break the vacuum.  Theory:  Even if the bell vacuum is broken, there's still the water traveling down the drain helping to maintain vacuum.  For a small system or slow filled system, the syphons method of action is going to bounce back and forth from air leaking into the bell from the side and the water pulling down from the drain.   I've witnessed this a few times where the rate of water entering the bed and water leaving via syphon gets close to equal ( due to high input rate OR inefficient/undersized syphon ).  That's part of why I avoid adding holes to the bell as they cut into the amount of vacuum that can develop and be maintained, equating to less water being syphoned out."

aquaponics,2fpsmj,neotekz,1 point,Sun Sep 7 15:52:50 2014 UTC,"I'm going off the below explanation, from the Practical Fish Keeping Forum:  'It's important to understand what airstones do. Their main job is pulling water up from where the airstone is to the top of the tank. So if you put the airstone on the gravel, it creates an area of uplift that pulls water from the bottom up to the top. The importance to this is that if this bottom water goes up, then that water is more likely to absorb oxygen from the air. Furthermore, as this water is pulled up, other water will have to ""fall down"" to replace it, so a sort of circulation is created. Over time, airstones ensure water all around the aquarium moves, and some of the time that water is at the top being re-oxygenated.  The strength of this is proportional to the size and number of airstones; obviously one little airstone in a 500 litre aquarium won't have much effect!  It's important to realise that the air bubbles themselves don't really oxygenate the water by any great degree. That's why you can get the same kind of useful circulation using a powerhead; indeed, powerheads move more water more strongly, so the effect is usually much better than that of an airstone. Powerheads also work better in deep tanks (air pumps move less air the deeper the airstone is placed) and they generally work more reliably and efficiently (fewer moving parts and unlike air pumps, they don't need much maintenance). Filter pumps will work just as well as powerheads, and if the filter sucks in water at the bottom of the tank (as it should) and pushes the water out at the top (again, as it should) then you should get good water circulation and oxygenation. Spray bars and venturis can be used to increase the mixing of air and water at the surface, so they're usually a good idea.  ... (some content removed by symbio) ...  The bottom line is that there's nothing an air stone will do that a good filter or powerhead won't. So you definitely don't need them. In 25 years of fishkeeping, I've almost never used airstones and only rarely use air at all (mostly in breeding tanks). Furthermore, airstones may actually be counterproductive to what you're trying to achieve in a planted aquarium.  Cheers, Neale'"

aquaponics,2fpsmj,siwhoaks,2,Sun Sep 7 20:20:23 2014 UTC,In my smaller 200L system I've got water falling from a height of about 10 inches from 2 different pumps. This happens every 12 mins for 3 mins. Is there are a better way of doing this?  Perhaps as Op mentioned by adding an air rock or small pump blowing air into the water?
aquaponics,2fpsmj,zynix,2,Sun Sep 7 13:41:24 2014 UTC,"http://imgur.com/XG9XLNy  That's the drain going from the fish tank into the sump.  It takes two 45 degree bends out of the fish tank.  Not shown but later another straight pipe was attached to that end joint and then a T connector was put on so that the water slams into the end of the T and spills out each side adding extra agitation.   In addition, just prior to the joint you can see a bunch of holes in the tube.  They do NOT vacuum water air into the tube but they do add additional turbulence to the water.  A friend of mine that's a professional grower brought over a D/O sensor which read 8mg/l with just my flood & drain system, switching on the line to the Fish tank and sending the water down brought D/O up to 9 mg/l.   Adding an airstone with battery backup into the fish tank brought the D/O up to 10mg/ml which is almost the maximum you can get at my tank temperature.   As far as I know max D/O in water is 19-20mg/ml @ almost 0C so I'm happy with my 10 mg/l (  As far as I know, D/O can rise fall quickly but not that quickly so after 30 minutes I was done waiting to see how high D/O could get ).  One thing to keep in mind, as I mentioned, I have an airstone with battery backup.  D/O isn't a super big issue when you have a low stocking density, but as you increase density, the fish in tank consume much more oxygen which isn't a problemuntil someone pulls the plug by accident, a fuse blows, power goes out, or the water pump dies then the D/O will be consumed by the fish until there is none.  I've never had this happen but I've been told that in high density tanks, the fish can consume almost all of the oxygen in less than 30 minutes.  edit:  Before I forget, my system water is currently ~62F or around 15C   Edit to Edit: finally home - http://imgur.com/Wts9pYe shows the T cap on my fish tank drain going into sump tank.

With just the bell siphons my fish are fine, plenty of oxygen, never see them gasping for air at the surface or any other stress-indicating behavior.

What you're describing is getting into an area of aquaponics that's very complex but in which there's a lot of potential.    What they do is remove all solid fish waste from the system, and add it back into the system using something like a ""compost bed filter"" slowly and intentionally, measuring the chemistry the whole time.  The process is called ""mineralization"" and it allows you to grow a lot of plants from relatively few fish (the goal of many commercial aquaponics ventures).    You can add things other than fish waste to this process as well."

However, minerals don't really decompose, so what harm would allowing excess concentration to be available as plants need it? Unless the goal is to stretch the mineral supply as thin as possible to get the highest theoretical returns per unit of waste.  What I had in mind was more of using compost leachate as process water.

I would assume the pond starter will be useful for speeding up the initial cycle of the system.

It's as ""simple"" as that, but requires a good bit of math to come up with, if you're serious about efficiency and stability.   ""Pounds per gallon"" stocking recommendations that people pretending to be experts [most ""aquaponics experts"" unfortunately] hand out are complete and total rubbish. Pounds per gallon [kg/l, etc.] is a benchmark [or bragging] number, used to determine things like spatial efficiency. It really shouldn't ever be applied to stocking density recommendations, as it gives no consideration to biological filtration capabilities of the system itself. In other words, it is nothing more than a stab in the dark... a guess.  You should decide how many pounds of fish you want to harvest, and the frequency that you wish to harvest them. Then do some calculations to determine how much fish mass will be required to support those harvest goals, keeping in mind that different size classes of fish will be present in your various fish tanks [separated by age/size] and stocked/harvested on a revolving basis. From there, you calculate the daily feed rate requirements [keeping in mind the protein percentage of the food as it is the primary source of N input], which determines the amount of bio filtration capacity that is needed to support the fish. Other things such as biological oxygen demand also come into play as well once/if you start to really push the system."

Error in this case means fish losses or total system failure.   If you haven't already,  read SRAC 451 as they also mention basic math for feed to weight for tilapia and a few other useful points of information.

aquaponics,2fid8u,JCollierDavis,2,Sat Sep 6 16:28:33 2014 UTC,"Stocking density is a moving target.  For the first 6-12 months while an AP system develops, it won't perfectly handle 1lb:3-5 gallons.   That can actually be advantageous.  Start with 10-30% stocking density and when your system catches up and all levels go to 0 ( NH4, NO3, NO4 ) you can add ~5-10% more.   Eventually reaching a point where NO4 stays in the 5-10ppm range.  Advantageous because AP is best with gentle changes ( harvesting all of the fish/plants in a close time span will cause problems ).  Also keep in mind, as you get closer to ""they won't fit"" you're going to run into sludge problems.  Biolayer is great at absorbing ammonia, but there's only so much particle filtration before you start getting excessive biofilms around the input for a media bed ( you'll run into this a lot quicker with DWC where the slime literally chokes plant roots ).   From what I've seen a popular and easy to do fix is to add a swirl filter ( there's a lot of examples if you google ""aquaponic swirl filter"" ).  Another point to keep in mind, with one of my systems, when I got close to maximum stocking density with goldfish, the fish got into the habit of murdering each other even if water quality is perfect.   Another system I help out on is stocked with Tilapia and they're less aggressive towards each other.  So keep in mind/research the temperament of the fish you're stocking.  Last point, as you reach maximum stocking density, it becomes a lot more important to check your fish for health issues.  I lost ~60 goldfish due to a Argulidae ( fresh water fish lice ) infestation in less than a week.  That could have been avoided if I had a quarantine tank but other problems like viral/bacterial infections will be a lot harder to avoid as density increases.   And keep in mind that if you lose a lot of fish, your plants are going to have a setback as nitrate and trace mineral levels go down."

Either way, if it will be a huge hassle for you to reduce your flood/drain times, then I wouldn't bother, your system will be healthy and happy the way it is. Just make sure your drain doesn't get clogged and cause water to sit in the grow bed for hours on end, as this will damage the system.   As far as the urine goes, we can't give you a realistic answer to your question because:   We have no idea how much of what substances are in your urine We have no idea how much urine you're producing We have no idea what the volume of your system is   I would recommend looking up some guides for ""hummonia""/urine-based  fishless cycling and see what others are doing. It's not the most common practice so I'm not sure how many people on this subreddit are going to have experience with it. Everyone I know just uses lab grade ammonia or rotting fish food to start their systems.    Edit: About the urine, I can say with some certainty:   Urine takes time to degrade into ammonia, so you will have a slow start if you're just peeing directly into your water and not using pre-aged urine The easiest way to know if you're adding enough is to test your ammonia level every day (even 2 times a day if possible, eg 1 in morning 1 at n ight). For starting a system you want to be at least at 1ppm ammonia and definitely not over 4ppm.  Too much ammonia will hinder/kill off the bacteria, and too little will cause slow growth. Since you're using fresh urine, your ammonia levels might rise slowly in the days after you've added it, be careful not to over-dose the system. Monitor your ammonia levels frequently and do some water changes if the ammonia level gets too high.  Be careful about what you're eating/drinking/consuming while you're peeing into your own system. A lot more than ammonia comes out of us in our urine. There are definitely many toxic substances that can pass through us and be excreted through urine."

Fresh pee is problematic and unpredictable.    A guess: 1 pee per 100 gallons to start cycling (a pee after bar time counts as two).  Flood-drain time doesn't matter that much.  Constant-flood systems work just fine, assuming you aerate enough.  You want to cycle all the water in the system every hour.  That's the number to shoot for."

Something having to do with the pH of the urine rising drastically and killing off most bacteria as well as more ammonia having a chance to form before you add it to the system.  I wrote this based off of memories of a few forum posts that I saw so it could very well be wrong, but I do know that most ""peeponics"" systems I've read about incorporated aged urine, not fresh urine."

But in a commercial aquaponics operation... I just don't see why anyone wouldn't design the system such that the fish were profitable anyway :D
aquaponics,2fdpag,Aquaponics-Heretic,3,Thu Sep 4 05:43:12 2014 UTC,"Another main advantage those of us concerned with collapse of industrial systems and peak oil can see with Aquaponics is the independence from remotely-sourced fertilizer inputs.   I agree about profitability, though. I've run numbers on backyard vs differently sized commercial options, with conservative estimates for profits and losses (for example, I use sale prices for plants that are comparable with conventional produce, I don't assume I'll be making premium prices), and what I found is that, as you say a backyard system is acceptable - it fulfills the requirement of being more or less revenue neutral as well as not taking too much time. So you make a fair amount of produce for your family's consumption, and the money you save from not having to buy produce is worth the time and initial investment. Crucially, as well, a backyard system can be purchased without borrowing money. With commercial systems, what my calculations showed was that a smallish system of 4000 or so plants/month that used not too much land (like, just a large suburban block) would require the owner to work full time to run it. This would take away your ability to work a regular job, which increases the risk of the project significantly. Also the profit is very uncertain, as you would probably have to focus on a limited range of plants to be able to offer regular weekly deliveries of them in commercial quantities. A medium-sized business of around 12000 plants/month would require you to work full time, with another person full time and 3 casual/part-timers for harvest days and other predictable, but labour-intensive, times. This last option could be profitable, but ultimately would only be able to offer you a salary of about $60k/year. That is fine, but to go to all that effort and take all that risk just for $60k?? On top of that, at no point did the fish become profitable - one thing I realized was that I would be producing enormous quantities iOS compostable mateial, so I thought maybe of combining the AP with some co-located conventional growing, perhaps orchards, and using the biomass and surplus fish as fertilizer. Really though, a small backyard system that halves our cost of food (reducing living costs by 10-15% overall) and doesn't interfere with having a regular job, seems much more sensible. What's more, if you gradually expand it out of savings, by the time you retire you could have a medium-sized setup which you could run on your own and which would be mildly profitable, mainly due to your lack of debt at that point - at retirement you won't have your house mortgage to pay off, and because the expansion was gradual there is no business loan to pay off either."

The same process that makes fish urine/feces drive the nitrogen cycle also works with human urine/feces (although feces is obviously a terrible thing to add to your system without proper waste treatment - urine is much cleaner to begin with and generally won't cause any negative bacterial problems in your system, although you should never be peeing in the system once live animals are in it.)"

aquaponics,2fe6b2,WonkoTheSane__,1 point,Thu Sep 4 15:03:38 2014 UTC,"Yes, basically. Most serious practitioners of this usually bottle the urine up and let it age in a bottle before they add it to their system though. It works better that way. Urine is not high in ammonia when you first pee, it takes time for it to break down into ammonia. If you just start peeing in your system without knowing what you're doing, you will very likely over-dose it because testing for ammonia won't show much right away.   It's best to pee in a bottle and wait for the pH to elevate to something like 9.0 before adding it to your system. This way you will get ammonia readings immediately and can accurately dose.  I personally stick with bottled ammonia as it's easier to work with and dose."

That may or may not be a bad thing depending on how much of it you use and how much acid your system is producing. If your pH is constantly trying to crash, an alkaline substrate might help keep it balanced. On the other hand it could keep your pH too high and negatively impact plant growth.

aquaponics,2fchdq,froschkonig,1 point,Wed Sep 3 10:58:10 2014 UTC,"Technically speaking there are not a whole lot of fish that 10 gallons is big enough for. Plenty of fish will survive and appear to do just fine but things like goldfish will have stunted growth and poor health compared to in a larger system.   That being said, thousands of people disregard this and put fish such as goldfish in tanks even smaller than 10 gallons all the time, and with proper care and filtration the fish will survive and keep pooping. I personally wouldn't recommend trying as it's bad for the fish and it can also be hard to balance the system at first.   Something like tetras or rasboras would probably work out for your needs. They don't produce all that much waste but you don't have a lot of responsible options in a tank that small. They're common decorative fish and I think they look nice. If you have nutrient deficiency issues you can always dose with a little bit of supplemental nutrients until your system is established and can handle itself.   I ran aquaponics off of nothing but guppies in a 50 gallon decorative aquarium and my plants flourished. Just pick the right plants for a lightweight system and you'll be fine even with fish that aren't very wasteful.  It could take a while for the system to become fully established and produce beautiful healthy looking plants without the addition of a supplement like maxicrop, but there's nothing wrong with that."

aquaponics,2f980g,CogitoNM,0,Wed Sep 3 13:45:32 2014 UTC,"Well. This is the very basic tenet to Aquaponics. So I'm surprised you haven't found this out yet.   Essentially, this is the Nitrogen Cycle. A major component of Fish Waste is Ammonia. Via the Nitrifying Bacteria that is growing in your Biofilter (and elsewhere) the Ammonia is converted to Nitrates and Nitrites. Both of these are essentially plant food. However, as Algae is also a 'plant' it can consume it too. So by having enough plant filtration you don't leave any food for the Algae.   This means that you have 3 basic types of filtration for your pond / fish tank. Mechanical, to strain away the solids. This is not 100% required if you have a gravel bed situation, but is very essential if you are doing DWC / Floating Rafts. Next is the Biofilter. This is where the Nitrifying Bacterias live. They hate plastic, so this is usually something like Lava Rock, SpringFlo, Hydroton, etc, etc, etc. Next, you have the Plant Filter. In Aquaponics this is your Veggies. Tomatoes, Lettuce, Basil, etc. These plants all consume your Nitrates. However, if you harvest in large swaths and don't immediately repopulate you might want a bit of a buffer with Aquatic Mint or something like that. Because if you remove 1/3 of your previously sufficient plant filter you will develop algae (assuming you are still feeding your fish).   Any questions?"

However, if you are doing a floating raft system, for example, and have 2/3 of your plants as lettuce that are planted at the same time. You will pull them all at once, theoretically. If you do that, you will have a huge algae bloom even if you replant right afterwards, because the new lettuce isn't big enough yet to feed at the same rate as the recently harvested.

It seems like it could be really amazing when the system is established but for the next 1-4 months I've been looking into aquatic plants that can act as a carbon/calcium sink.   Not listed but one aquatic plant I've been looking into is Ceratophyllum demersum/Hornwort/Coontails as it sounds like it could handle my system 8.2 PH and not need heavy light exposure.  Are any of the 10 plants you listed able to thrive in high alkaline ( + 7.8 )?

aquaponics,2f1w6a,Maki_Man,1 point,Wed Sep 3 14:58:27 2014 UTC,Each of the fish tanks has a SLO(solids lifting overflow) which should get the solids off the bottom of the tanks.

aquaponics,2f1zor,Aquaponics-Heretic,2,Sun Aug 31 04:54:09 2014 UTC,Sure you could...  But you can just as easily shade your tank from sunlight...  Which along with the plants taking up the nutrients...  Results in no/little algae

However, when you start seeing algae blooms you know something is wrong with your system, and something needs to be done before bad things start happening, and if you get plecos you might not notice such changes right away.   A well setup system, even in full light, will never get algae. (except for the sidewall algae, you can never really get away from that)"

aquaponics,2f1zor,brontide,1 point,Sun Aug 31 07:49:14 2014 UTC,Finally someone with firsthand experience with em! Yea we would usually have ours in our tank for about a year before they would die... We would wait for the tank to get quite filthy and then bring in a new one. The last one we had never stopped growing and got to I think 10-11 inches. The guy was massive. Usually they are very skiddish nocturnal predators but this one was very social and would swim to the outside glass everytime someone was nearby. I miss him! We also had a couple freshwater crabs. The tank would completely clean itself. That's kind of what I picture for aquaponics however my understanding is still pretty basic as my only experience is with hydroponics and aquaponics is very different in some ways and similar in others.
aquaponics,2f1zor,Sycosys,1 point,Sun Aug 31 16:10:48 2014 UTC,"I am not a professional, however if you need citations I will gladly dig them up. I am an aquarium enthusiast for years now. Plecostomi are actually rather poor at maintaining algae growth.  It is a common myth usually because of their habit of clinging to glass.  I have had some success with Hong Kong Butterfly Plecos and algae maintenance but these are also quite difficult to get depending on location and very specific habitat requirements are necessitated.  What fish do you have in your tank currently?  What level of light is it facing? How large of a pump do you have and do you have clean filtration systems?"

I have a rather sizeable population of mystery snails of all sizes living in both of my systems and they are no problem at all. As a matter of fact snails process rather large volumes of solid waste and contribute to the nitrogen cycle of your system.

I'd also rather not have a full system in the front where things are more prone to theft.  Also it's not necessarily going to be limited to two systems.  There's an area in the backyard that would make a lovely koi pond, another area on the side for more grow towers, etc.  I also like the idea of having to check the water in one spot.  One water test to rule them all."

aquaponics,2f1fd3,Armor_of_Inferno,2,Sun Aug 31 04:45:11 2014 UTC,"You wouldn't want to do that, it would be much easier in my experience to have several systems instead, each with a sump and grow bed.   Each tank needs at least 6 inches of drop for a proper gravity fed bridge overflow siphon to function correctly, that adds up to several feet very quickly. Three tanks in succession is generally the max I'm willing to drop before a sump in most of my recirculating systems. Note, these siphons are on the top lip of the aquarium, bottom drilling would need even more height.   Another thing is temperature difference, colder water from outside tanks in winter will cause condensation on indoor tank glass. That's no bueno."
aquaponics,2f1fd3,ColdWeatherAquaponic,1 point,Sun Aug 31 02:24:16 2014 UTC,"I think a sump tank could go a long way to helping you keep your water level the same in each fish tank.  The distance across hundreds of feet would make it harder, but by having a sump tank as the central hub to your system, the system will absorb the rise and fall of water as your grow beds flood and drain.  This is the concept behind Murray Hallam's CHOP2 system design.  Water is pumped from the sump to the fish tanks, which keep at a constant height because the exit drain is on the top of one of the fish tank walls.  Water also gets pumped from the sump to the grow beds.  It seems that this system would work just as well with two tanks, but you'll need to increase the power of the pump to keep up pressure and cover those extra hundreds of feet."

Get a full test kit and then use aquaponics as an example of the movement from animal waste/ammonia -> nitrate -> nitrite -> plants.    After the test kit you just need a simple setup with a small tank and some goldfish to show the nitrogen cycle and grow some plants.  Focus on some easy ones like salad fixings.

They're awesome for cooling and for getting the ground warm early in spring for in-ground greenhouse planting.  For winter aquaponics heating they help some.  Not that dramatic.  If you're digging a hole to pour a foundation you might as well put one in though - with the hole dug it's not that hard to run some pipes."

There are some other ideas for how to store heat in a greenhouse, like black metal barrels filled with water against the north wall.  I've been experimenting with PCMs, but they're not commercially available.  Are you using it for aquaponics, growing in the ground, something else?"

I'm a bit intimidated by digging a 2x11x17 foot hole in my back yard for the whole thing, so there's that.  I'll for sure have some aquaponics set up in there and maybe some regular potted plants too.  I have no idea what kind of planning factor I need to use regarding how much effort it will take to keep it at a particular temperature."
aquaponics,2equrj,Sycosys,1 point,Wed Aug 27 20:00:41 2014 UTC,"Can I ask what you mean by ""planning factor?""  You mean heat input?  The absolute best thing you can do to store heat in your greenhouse is to put a blanket over the glazing (plastic or glass) at night.  That's how the Chinese grow in their greenhouses.  It changes the whole game!  They do it by hand.  I think I'd rather have it motorized.  After that, storing heat from the sun makes a big difference.  Black metal barrels, concrete, anything heavy will store heat.    Stuff like SCHS would be a few notches down on the list, in my humble opinion."
aquaponics,2equrj,Sycosys,1 point,Wed Aug 27 20:05:40 2014 UTC,"Sure.  I know the interior volume of my space along with how I'll insulate it and what kind of plastic I want for the clear portion.  What I don't know is how warm will it get in the winter when it's about 20o out during the day and how warm will it stay overnight when it's about -20o or so?  I have no idea how to estimate a base line or the effect of any supplemental heat I might use. I also have no idea how to estimate the added benefit of using dual layer inflated plastic sheeting or twin/triple wall polycarbonate.  If I could it would be easy to determine the cost/benefit of each alternative.  If I can keep it above 0o all the time, then I can grow plants hardy down to zone 10.  That means I can plant anything that will grow in the US."

A poorly made greenhouse will stay above zero when it's -20 degF.  You can improve it from there.  During the day, the amount of sun makes much more difference than outdoor temps.  I had a day when it was zero where my GH temps hit 70.  On a cloudy day, it would have been like 25.  Right, hardy varieties of spinach will survive temps of zero."

What if i built a 8x4x2 foot container, filled it with a heap of topsoil, and insulate it with foamboard insulation on all sides. Would that be a sufficient thermal mass to make a useful contribution to a 144sq worth of greenhouse? I could also squeeze the whole system (upgradeable to two systems) underneath my growbeds and not really give up any grow area.   Edit: Random thought. I could also, conceivably, route exhaust heat from my rocket stove into the box."

Seriously, what you're proposing is a fascinating idea that I would love to hear you develop further.    Under your grow beds, a heated mass (from your rocket stove) would transfer some of that heat to the water and grow media naturally.  If you ran pex pipe through the mass you could circulate water through it to warm up the water further, or to warm the air in a low tunnel over the grow beds.  If you're interested in trying to store the maximum amount of heat in your thermal mass bed, you could do some research on different materials.  The value you're looking for is specific heat by volume - the more the better.  I'd look at water, sand, concrete, and clay.  You might be able to combine materials (i.e. sand/water) to further maximize heat storage.   I'm really intrigued by this idea.  I think it has awesome potential!"

As for running pex. maybe when i build my next greenhouse out of wood , glass and concrete :)  I have hopeful ambitions (likely misplaced) of keeping my Blue Tilapia warm (above 50 degrees).

aquaponics,2equrj,aaronts9,1 point,Fri Dec 5 22:02:19 2014 UTC,"Depends a lot on the design.  If you insulate the ground around the perimeter it can warm up over the course of years and improve somewhat over time.  Deeper and thinner pipes make a difference.  Also depends on your climate and the amount of evaporation happening.  If your greenhouse is humid, you can convert a lot of that moisture to heat using an SCHS."
aquaponics,2equrj,aaronts9,1 point,Mon Dec 29 16:47:26 2014 UTC,"I haven't built a rocket stove but have built other kinds of stoves.  How are you heating the water?  I've been curious to know how people do that with rocket stoves.  The big advantage I've heard with rocket stoves is that you can heat up a really large mass of something like cobb, brick, water barrels, etc... in a short time and all that mass will stay hot for a long time.  I'm not sure if it work that well in aquaponics because you need to be able to keep your water within a 1-2 degree band more or less.  Slow swings are okay, but not fast ones.  Having a supplementary rocket mass heater in your greenhouse for really cold nights, or if you want to spend some quality time there seems like a great idea.  One idea I really like is using a rocket stove to heat water for a hot tub.  After you use the hot tub, close it up and drain water into the aquaponics as needed to keep temperatures up (could be done with a little controller).  That'll allow you to:    1. have fun in your hot tub. 2. do water changes to allow you to keep more fish  3. provide your water heating needs."

Searching through research papers... particularly when i commenced my aquaculture studies... the lowest level of nitrate toxicity suggested was 450 ppm for Blue Gill...  I have seen a more recent paper that suggested levels for rainbow trout may inhibit growth to some extent if above (from memory) 150 ppm... (I'll find the paper and link)  The question raised though would have to be why are your nitrate levels exceeding 100 ppm....  I t would suggest that you have insufficient plants to utilise the nitrates available (some what of a waste of resources)....   Or to put it another way... that you perhaps have too many fish/feed rate... for your available plant numbers...   You could try the (ineloquent) UVI bird-netting ""denitrification"" method for nitrate manipulation...

I think this varies a lot.  I could see what you're saying in a dry climate like Australia or California in which gardening requires irrigation.    Most - or at least a good portion - of the people I talked to here in the midwest, northeast, and eastern Europe already garden extensively and want to add fish to their repertoire.    The other thing that's a great bonus is the high quality of lettuce, basil, spinach, and other greens you can get out of aquaponics that beats soil-growing hands down.  Season extension is another benefit.  So what I've heard from people (and what I'm going for) is that they want as much fish as they can easily raise and some good quality greens.  In a backyard situation without labor costs the margins are very good so maximizing outputs is less crucial.  Getting what you want to eat is the goal.    The Zero-to-Hero system or the alternating flood-drain that I use can be maximized for either fish or plants, up to a point.  Above a certain stocking rate I'd be more in the realm of RAS.  As you said, I don't have the knowledge for that, though I have done some reading and am curious to see what I can do with denitrification."

And in the context of ""cold climate"" (sometimes extreme) scenarios... then soil based plant growth is a lot harder than aquaponics (or hydroponics) in a greenhouse... ;)  I'm certainly not opposed to timer based flood & drain methodologies... and a case could be made that they might be more applicable in colder climates to some extent...  And I'm most certainly not against timer based indexed (alternating) flood & drain... having utilised such since my very early days... when I developed the ""aquaponics indexing valve"" for that very purpose :D  But I don't understand how utilising an ""alternating"" index valve maximises fish???"

If the sole purpose of the system is to provide an ambient temperature buffer, food safe drums, or antifreeze, etc could be used to keep the exterior lines from freezing at night.

Organic certification might change that, but that remains hard to get and the benefits remain to be seen.    On the backyard side the market is small: limited to preppers and permaculturists, for the most part.  Because you can buy nearly everything you need at the hardware store, there's not a lot to sell anyone.  If you love aquaponics, do it for yourself, in your spare time.  Don't worry about whether it could be a job.  That'll drive you nuts.  If you don't love it, don't bother with it.

About halfway done building a 500 gallon system in my parents barn in upstate NY.  Gets quite cold here in the winter but I am planning to keep the system running year round.  The fish are downstairs and the plants are in the hayloft.  Its a 20'x25' gabled hayloft and the roofing has been replaced with 8mm twinwall polycarbonate.  The north wall will be insulated and most of the CO2 will be cycled up from the animal pens underneath to keep avoid bring in icy wind because we need the CO2.  I've got a few questions if you have time:   Water is a good store of heat.  Since I need to maintain pretty high (for winter) temps in my fish tanks anyway, will cascading water through my system on the second floor transfer a helpful amount of heat to the air?  I am planning several flood and drain cascading growbeds and a series of cascading 8 gallon bucket setups.  Will that warm water falling through the air warm the air up or just cool the water down a lot?  We have a very efficient water heater. We are planning to execute some type of tenting with greenhouse plastic to reduce the cubic feet of space in the hayloft that needs to be kept warm for the plants.  This should also have the effect of creating air pockets that will insulate the space better.  Does this seem like a good idea or do you have alternative ideas?  Basically the hayloft is really tall (12' ft?) and a lot of cubic ft to keep warm because it is gabled. Any recs on cold hardy plants that will still adequately filter the water for the fish that I could swap in for the winter?   Thanks for your time!  -Duncan"
aquaponics,2equrj,So-Cal-Mountain-Man,2,Wed Aug 27 20:18:29 2014 UTC,Hey ragamufin.  Thanks!  I was a power systems engineer for a few years after college.  Designed mostly airports.   Sounds like an exciting idea.  I've been hearing more and more about barns being converted to aquapoincs.  Got a fellow in my area who's doing it.  I'll take a go at your questions one at a time.
aquaponics,2equrj,vfxslave,2,Thu Aug 28 01:43:21 2014 UTC,1- It depends on whether the cascading is happening in an enclosed insulated piping system or exposed to the air.  The biggest effect will be enthalpy transfer through evaporation.  Check out Fundamentals #2 on my blog.
aquaponics,2equrj,jinqsi,2,Thu Aug 28 03:41:57 2014 UTC,"2- You're on the right track.  Eliot Coleman showed us how well a small plastic low tunnel could protect plants.  That works gangbusters if you position it directly over your grow beds and air seal it.  You just heat the water, and the water will release enough heat to keep that small area warm.  A little fluorescent light in there will help too, also extending the plant growing season (as opposed to the plant staying-alive season)."
aquaponics,2equrj,jinqsi,2,Wed Aug 27 20:01:43 2014 UTC,"3- Hardy spinach works best - that's what I've had luck with. Probably winter kale and chard would do okay, though that's so easy to grow in-ground.  Removing nitrates from the water in winter is a challenge if you have high stocking rates because the plants grow slowly without supplemental light. I just do a couple 1/4 water changes per month. However I've been surprised at what high nitrate levels trout will tolerate.  They're supposed to be finicky.  BS in my opinion.  They're tough!"
aquaponics,2equrj,Aquaponics-Heretic,1 point,Wed Aug 27 20:07:50 2014 UTC,I should have read through the AMA first I think.  It looks like you definitely recommend heating the water rather than the air.  And you recommend sealing the grow beds rather than reducing the cubic ft of air inside the space with tenting.

aquaponics,2equrj,TheChonk,1 point,Wed Aug 27 20:09:49 2014 UTC,I've always wondered how you managed to keep temps cool in your UEA greenhouses.  I would guess evaporative cooling is the key.  Am I right about that?
aquaponics,2equrj,EarthPrimeInc,1 point,Wed Aug 27 20:12:44 2014 UTC,"I was under the impression that UAE was a dry place, though it appears from wikipedia that you have moderate humidity.    Shading and ventilation are the most obvious way, though that wouldn't allow you to keep your inside temperatures below the outside, at least not very much.  Transpiration would help, though that's still evaporation.    Thermal mass would help, though you'd need A LOT especially with the near-constant summer solar radiation.  From what you said on APNation about 100%RH during the day, your options would be quite limited.  Seems like you'd have to head in the direction of heat pumps - perhaps ground source.  Of course if the soil's sandy that would be less effective (though maybe it's not sandy - I can't find easy data on that).  I could also see ice storage as a viable option, though that would be fairly energy-intensive.  I'm not sure if you're going to tell me if I figure out your strategy, but it's kind-of fun to guess at it."

Basically we examine flows through the grid and advise transmission owners on where HVDC lines and new generation should be built.  A lot of transmission congestion analysis and loss of load expectation studies when we are talking about potential investments in the grid.  While I am an engineer, what I do is probably more appropriately labeled power systems consulting, since the physical design of the systems is an input to our workflow rather than something we produce or advise on.  The IBCs have a steel frame, my dad was thinking about building that out and doing spray foam.  Price isn't a huge factor but it is always nice to keep costs down so the whole thing isn't just a novelty money sink."

Below that you might get into Arctic Char, which I've heard taste awesome!  However, below 50 you want to make sure you have significant excess biofilter capacity, as biofiltration rates decrease as temperatures drop.  You can find them at a local fish hatchery.

One night the scorpion died immediately after eating a bug he believed had just gotten into some poison his neighbor's pest company sprayed. I keep small bream that we call rockbass to use as bait for striper fishing. I feed them crickets and worms and they freaking love them. You can start yourself a worm farm pretty easily. It'd be very beneficial for several reasons. You can feed them to your fish. You can harvest the castings and make worm tea to improve your fruits and veges growing in dirt. Also, get the bream adapted to pellets. When you're going to finally eat the bluegill, stop with the pellets at least two weeks ahead of harvest and feed them the crickets and worms sparingly. Bluegill will produce plenty of waste, so be ready to keep an eye on your filters. But, they're tuff as nails and they can survive a lot that many fish can't. I hope I gave you some ideas and possibly some info you didn't already think of. Good luck!  Edit: I forgot to add that you will want to steer clear of any house lights for what you're wanting to do.

It has a couple swirl filters off a secondary pump but not the main, so the inside of those pipes is getting a bit nasty, but the lettuce seems to like it.

I seeded the same day I finished the system so my fish would have a small filter right away.  I gave the system 2 days to aerate and gas all the chlorine off. Then I added a 5 gallon bucket of water from my parents pond, plus my fish.  Normally it takes months for the powerhouse of the system to grow. (Bacteria). But I added them to my system in an oxygen rich environment. Plus it was 95 degrees out so I'm sure that helped them grow too.  As far as chemistry goes. I've worked at plant nurseries for 15 years and learned a lot of horticulture from that. I've never used test strips on my system. I know how to read my plants and see what they need. (Yellowing, purpling, browning, spotting, tipping are all nutrient deficiencies.)  While the nitrate level of the system is low, the plants are young so theres no need for a large amount of it yet. There's still time for it build up. The cucumbers are rooted about 3"" down so they HAVE to be taking up nutrients."

Right now I'm betting I can do it in 7.  While all of that's going on, the day after I put in the AP donor water, I'll throw in the first few seeds ( likely raddish ) and if things are going right they should sprout by their 4th day.  So that said, irrelevant to testing the GrowStones and if I ever run into you in person; I'll wager a drink of your choice for the day the system is fully cycled ( 0's on NO2 & AM with at least 10ppm NO3 ).  Until the system stabilizes I generally test 3x a day so I imagine after day 4 there will be a good idea if I've missed the mark or not.   And to be fair, only things I'll use is a water heater, 10 gallons AP donor water, ammonia chloride, potassium or calcium carbonate, and ascorbic acid ( for chloramine ).  No water changes, no binders.  Race would start the day after I start the ascorbic acid as that should be long enough to get the chlorine/chloramine out.

aquaponics,2eo8i8,Krade33,1 point,Thu Aug 28 00:22:20 2014 UTC,"I'm still newish at this, but I notice something, correct me please - you have a standpipe for draining, and the nutrient flow goes over the edge into the barrel. When the pump is off, does water just sit in the barrel?"
aquaponics,2eo8i8,94332,1 point,Tue Aug 26 23:25:37 2014 UTC,"If it's a constant-flow system then the pump never turns off and this isn't a problem (this is the kind of system I run).    If it's a timed pump, standpipes like those can be used by just drilling a couple small holes in the very base of them so that when the pump turns off water will slowly drain out until the barrels are empty again.  (It's a slow process, as you want the holes small enough that the barrels will still flood when the pump is on, but it is cheap, effective, and easier than bell siphons.)"
aquaponics,2eo8i8,94332,1 point,Wed Aug 27 00:17:49 2014 UTC,I was going for a constant flow. Will that work with this set up?
aquaponics,2eo8i8,94332,0,Wed Aug 27 03:04:55 2014 UTC,"Yes, but you will want to be very careful about the standpipes getting clogged. You should build the same kind of strainers to put around your standpipes that you see everyone use for bell siphons. Here's an example. Note, however, that you'll want more holes in the strainer than that, or some kind of mesh that is mostly holes, as you don't want holes getting clogged by roots/sediment and having the water in your grow tray get much higher than the water inside the strainer (causing overflow).    I would also recommend supplemental aeration if possible for constant-flood systems, although as long as the water is falling a decent distance into the fish tank you probably won't NEED supplemental aeration, but it reduces the risk of anaerobic areas in your system and encourages more efficient bacterial growth/plant growth and fish health. Worms in the growbeds would help too.  Something else to consider is that power outages and pump failures can be catastrophic for a constant flood system unless precautions are taken.  If you can get an air pump with a battery backup and keep some air stones inside the grow bed, that will reduce the chances of all your bacteria dying in a prolonged power outage/pump failure.  If you can't do that, an alternative would be to ensure you always have enough room in your fish tank / sump for all the water from the grow beds to drain into it without it overflowing, then just drill a couple small holes at the bottom of the standpipes inside the grow bed so that if pump or power fails, the grow beds drain into the fish tank/sump."
aquaponics,2eo8i8,94332,1 point,Wed Aug 27 14:01:31 2014 UTC,"Assuming that those are 50 gallon barrels, and that you only put 40 gallons in the bottom one, and the top ones are only 40% filled with water (the rest is grow media and you want ~2 inches of dry grow media, so water should only be filled partially), that would put your system volume at 60 gallons.   People have all kinds of recommendations for ""turnover rate"", ranging from 2x per hour to 10x per hour.  How much turnover you use just depends on how heavily your system is stocked, and how much you want to over-do it to build in a safety margin to reduce chances of anaerobic issues and filtration issues.   As far as your system, since you want to do constant flood I would say you should try to go for at least 4X tank-volume per hour like /u/papabearmac says, but if possible I would push it even higher. You definitely don't have to if you don't want to but, within reason, more flow is always better. Excess flow also helps buffer against reductions in efficiency of your pump/plumbing down the road, and gives you the option of diverting some of the flow back into the fish tank to create more agitation/water circulation.  Something to take into consideration is that the GPH rating of your pump does not accurately represent the amount of flow it will produce from fish-tank -> grow-bed -> fishtank.  The first factor to take into account is vertical head, or lift. If the pump will be sitting 3 feet below where the water pours into the grow bed, then you need a pump rated at enough flow at 3 feet of head.   Take a look at this,  you'll notice this pump is rated for 140gph, but if you look at the chart below you'll see that it is 140 at 0 feet of lift. At 3 feet of lift it's rated for only 60GPH.   You need to measure your system's total vertical lift in your system and then buy a pump accordingly.  I believe you should measure the vertical distance between the surface of the water in the pump's container to where the water comes out of your plumbing into the grow bed.  I think the average 55 gallon drum is 2 feet wide. In the system design you linked, I would guess the pump height would be around 2 feet. It's best if you can get real measurements though.  Now, once you've got the pump head figured out you still need to account for the fact that the flow ratings at each pump height are most likely in straight vertical pipes with no bends/elbows. Unfortunately, every 90 degree elbow in your system has a negative impact on water flow and further reduces the pump's efficiency. Try to use 45 degree elbows where possible, as these reduce flow less.  I don't know how to do the math for flow resistance as impacted by bends in the pipe, but it's safe to assume that with the huge number of 90 degree elbows in that system, you would need to bump up pump size to something like this. (Note that this pump is rated for 205 GPH at 3 feet of lift. This would give you some head room to make sure you still meet the ""4x tank volume"" recommendation mentioned earlier. (That is, 4X 40 gallons of your fish tank, equaling 160 gph) .  If you left space between the two barrel halves for a pipe to come straight up from the fish tank, that would cut out a lot of wasteful plumbing. Note some people also use 2x 45 degree elbows to make a smoother 90 degree bend. 90 degree ""sweep"" elbows are even better, they're a smooth curve instead of a sharp turn and I believe they have the lowest resistance of these options. Here's what one looks like..    Final notes: My recommendations here are just to help you make decisions. You most definitely do NOT need a massive oversized pump, and you can make do with a bunch of regular 90 degree pvc bends if you'd like. Flow rates will be lower but aquaponics systems almost always settle into a balance with enough time, even if they have too little flow.   The most important thing to take away from all of this is that you can do just about whatever you want as far as water flow goes, but there are two things you absolutely have to do:    Make sure your system's water always has oxygen in it (agitation is good, air pumps with diffusers are good).  Make sure if you have low flow in your system that you stock less fish. A lightly stocked system requires less flow and less oxygen than a heavily stocked one, so when in doubt start with a small number of small fish and slowly add more as the system grows to accommodate them."
aquaponics,2eo8i8,94332,2,Wed Aug 27 14:42:03 2014 UTC,"Another thing to note is that if you want your system to be more stable in a constant flow setup, you might want to introduce filtration before the grow bed to catch any big solids. A really easy way is to just have the water dumping out of the pvc into the grow beds through a filter sock, but you can do all kinds of things (like a radial flow filter, note this can be scaled down into a 5 gallon bucket if you want, or a trash can).  This is, again, something that's not necessary, but will improve the cleanliness, stability, and longevity of your system.  If you incorporate worms into your grow beds they will help break down solids but you will still have to remove your grow media probably once a year to clean out any dead areas to make sure nothing builds up in your system. If you incorporate worms into the grow bed, and have solids filtration before the grow bed, you may not have to clean out your grow media."
aquaponics,2eo8i8,papabearmac,1 point,Wed Aug 27 14:50:28 2014 UTC,Here is an example of what you can do with the extra flow if you get a pump that creates too much flow for your system.  I did this in my system's sump and opened the valve that goes out sideways enough to let a bunch of water circulate right back into the sump. I put a PVC canister as a tower standing in the sump and had the water spray into that. There was tons of splashing in there and it trickled down over bio-balls so it doubled as backup bio-filtration in case anything happened to my grow bed. Here's a picture.

(try selling 2000 plants/week directly at farmers markets/restaurants in Australia... ain't going happen)  Wholesale pricing of lettuce (seasonally) will vary from $0.70 - $1.10... let's call it $1 for the sake of things  Your cost of production (including labour, packaging, transportation, insurances, taxes etc) will probably be close to $0.60/plant.. so your ""profit"" would be $0.40 per plant.... $800/week... $41,600/year... (assuming no losses... and maximum price return etc)  You'll need some sort of environmental controls in your greenhouses... either manual.. or automated...  And an additional separate harvest/packing shed.. for bio-security/ food safety compliance  And an integrated pest management plan  So probably at least $160,000 of Capex... possibly $200,000 (if automated controls)... maybe more to allow for working capital  Then there's the question of whether or not you can make your fish component profitable  And you'll have a problem making the fish component profitable unless you   Have the appropriate licences Sell ""live""... in which case you're selling wholesale (and will need enough volume to make it worthwhile for a wholesaler) If anything other than ""live"".. then you'll need appropriate food safety licences/accreditations, cold storage facilities, an accredited/licenced transportation vehicle, possibly HACCP accreditation and/or pest management programs (all require annual inspections)   If you rely solely on Silver Perch (or similar)... then you wont get any return from your fish in the first 18 months... because they don't grow through winter.. ( and this could very well cause nutrient issues for your plant production)  Trout would give you a return after six months.. but only through winter, as your temperatures would be too hot during summer... especially if your fish system is enclosed within the greenhouses  If you separate your fish RAS component (and I would)... then your Capex is further elevated... as it would be if you decided to run separate/concurrent species systems  To make your fish component profitable you'll either need to scale your RAS component accordingly.. or adopt the usual (and flawed) low stocking density model of current ""commercial aquaponics""  If this is the case... and you can't make your fish component profitable...   Then you should indeed do a cost benefit study to determine if the cost of nutrient provision from fish/fish feed is comparable/better than the cost of hydroponic nutrients... more often than not... it just isn't the case...  And your initial Capex would be lower for a comparable (or bigger) NFT hydroponic operation... while your operating cost would be the same (at worst)... way, way less if you didn't utilise greenhouses...  So at best you'll take 4-5 years to break even... let alone get an ROI... :D  And that's assuming you know what you're doing in terms of both fish and plant growing.. and no losses etc...  And there will be losses (probably of both fish & plants).. in your fist year...  Oh.. and you will be working ""full time""... don't believe other wise...  ;)"

The 2nd youtube is a woman named Sonja - I actually featured her video on my site.  Been meaning to get back to her with some feedback.  Good reminder, this.  The issue with both of these (to the extent I got the jist of the BYAP one) is that they are putting all the insulating value in the wall of the greenhouse - essentially installing a warm weather system in an insulated greenhouse.  It's the same thing I saw over and over on every forum.  I tried that and it didn't work. The problem was evaporation.  All that surface area of water exposed to air basically created an evaporative cooler inside my system.  The water evaporated and then condensed on the outside wall of the greenhouse, which sucked an incredible amount of heat from my system.    My second design took aim at preventing that evaporation, and it worked."

I could think of quite a few, such as pH buffering, solids lifting and removal, nutrient deficiencies, backup aerators, etc...

I suspect that the thing that led to your success was a willingness to spend a lot of time on forums pouring through 34-page threads.  Am I right?  Maybe that's the best way to do it - read everything out there that's been written.  I was following AP Source forum since it's US-based.  Also read the books I could find at the time (Nelson Pade's and Bernstein's).  Neither answered those questions.  I didn't think to ask till I had a problem.  Maybe I would have found more answers had I perused BYAP more.

I live in an area of oregon that has low temps in the winter in the low teens for stretches of time, and highs I'm the summer clearing 100+ degrees. I am at a standstill figuring out what type of fish to put in my system. The system will be outdoors in a sturdy hoop house. I guess my question is if I do fish such as trout or catfish I am worried that it will get too warm for them in the summer. And if I do tilapia it will be cold in the winter. So here is my question:  Can I use tilapia with a heater for my tank to keep at an optimal temperature, and then in the winter would the flow of the warmer water throughout my system help heat the greenhouse to an appropriate temperature?   Hopefully this makes sense I imagine with fans and a shade cloth I'll be able to keep the temperature inside the greenhouse reasonable, I am just worried about the cold winters and would like to have year round production  Thanks for the AMA"

aquaponics,2eac03,ColdWeatherAquaponic,0,Sat Aug 23 10:41:12 2014 UTC,"Hey Johnny,  You're asking exactly the right questions.  Most people either give up because they don't know where to start, or just install a unit heater in their greenhouse because they never had the forethought to ask the questions you're asking.  Fish selection is the easy part.  The best bang for your buck is 8"" tilapia in spring and 8"" trout in fall.  Grow out in 6 months and harvest twice per year.  Or you can raise perch or catfish year-round.  They grow slower, however, and hardly at all in winter when the water is below 60.  You're exactly right.  Heating your water is the best way.  Choose crops that can handle the cold - the best one is a hardy spinach such as Tyee.    Then you add layers of thermal protection, by which I mean insulation and air sealing.  You do it in such a way that any heat escaping from the water will be trapped in subsequent layers that keep your plants  warm.  How many layers and how much thermal protection depends on exactly what you mean by ""low temps"" in Oregon and what you're hoping to grow.    Folks I talk to in Yukon need a lot!  You might not need quite as much, unless you're living atop Mt. Hood."

The problem is lack of oxygen, with no drain cycle the bacteria growing in your system will all be anoxic, that will simply rot the roots of most of your plants and most will just wither away and die which is exactly what you describe. Constant flood is only ok if you are changing the entire water over at least a few times an hour, the bigger the system is this becomes impossible.

aquaponics,2e6py2,Aquaponics-Heretic,1 point,Fri Aug 22 19:55:22 2014 UTC,"Two things:  I'm here in Colorado and been trying to reach out to my brewery friends ( I have a few in Coors but none in New Belgium ) and they're interested as it would save them money as well vs disposal ( high capacity brewing does add up a lot of material ).  Second one is that I've been looking at your cold weather plans and there's a lot of good advice & tips; how you've laid things out makes it 1-2 steps short of an ""Idiot's guide to making a cold weather AP system"".    Only real critique I can put in is that I've been leaning towards something like a rocket mass stove as the heat source (vs the 1KW heat element ) and was curious if you've tried out anything like that?   Additionally encasing the FT in a refrigerator is a fairly nifty idea but was wondering if you'd had problems with condensation funk ( biofilm building up in places where it can dry out and smell bad ).    For the heating source, I'm trying to plan for worst case scenarios ( loss of power ) and a small solar array plus battery would cover air & water pumps, but I'd be apprehensive trying to build a battery array large enough to keep a 1KW going.  I'm planning on buying land relatively far out of the city and the big concern is if the power get's knocked out, it might be days or weeks before it gets fixed."
aquaponics,2e6py2,Aquaponics-Heretic,1 point,Fri Aug 22 20:41:19 2014 UTC,"Hi Zynix,  Thanks for the kind words.  That's what I was shooting for.  If you can think of anything that would make it closer to an ""idiot's guide"" I'd love to hear it.  You kind-of need to know a bit of carpentry and plumbing, but I can't see a way around that unless you buy one prefab.  That wouldn't be insulated though.  Glad to hear you're looking into brewery waste too. I'm surprised it's not currently used for some kind of animal feed.  With last year's drought I thought they'd tapped every possible feed source around.  The best way to heat, which I try and emphasize, is not by building a better heat source but by removing the need for it.  Insulate, air seal, and store solar heat in thermal mass.  Enough of that and you don't need the heater at all.  Trouble with rocket stoves is that they heat air, not water.  A rocket boiler could work.  Haven't seen one myself.  Yeah, I get algae on the window.  Not a problem though - I just scrape it off."

aquaponics,2e6lf5,GeneralDJ,2,Thu Aug 21 14:35:24 2014 UTC,"Given the winter temperatures in the Netherlands, and the fact that dutch greenhouses sometimes get heated by natural gas, i wonder if this article about thermally insolated greenhouses is relevant. Possibly a lot of work, and labour is expensive in the Netherlands. Also probably not suitable for current infrastructure.  Dont know enough at all to answer your question. In hydroponics the nitrigen is added manually or something?"
aquaponics,2e6lf5,Jasper1984,2,Thu Aug 21 22:48:38 2014 UTC,"thanks for the refernce. I read the article but this will never work for the Netherlands. Maybe southern europe where overcast all day is less common.   'The results on the cloudy day, however, show that the north wall, the north roof and the soil all contribute heat to the interior air throughout the day since the interior air is not heated significantly by the substantially reduced solar insulation on the cloudy day.' Tong et al. (2009).   also the wall would just be a loss of light coming in. actually the larger part of the year the greenhouses are heated because gas and other fossil fuels are still extremely cheap. Also, the labour going into this sytem can easily be automated.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71ivsJ9_1MU  that's probably how our greenhouses are going to be run in 20 years. it's awesome, but also expensive to build.

You want the larger diameter guard so you can access and visually check the drain.  As for having the inlet IF you have the media guard, it might be a bit overkill.  If you grow stuff like tomato's and cucumbers, they are EXTREMELY pervasive in their root system to the point of putting a expiration date on your growbed, after which you will need to go in and clean the roots out.   Multiple people have recommended seeding your bed after your 2nd or 3rd full harvest with Red worms ( after you've got a good buildup of fish gunk and rotting old roots for the worms to live off ).  Edit:    I've had mixed luck with uniseals and have gotten into the habit of putting a thin bead of silicon around the gasket to cut down on leaks.  #1 avoidable water loss is going to be those little leaks."

Hopefully my other comment is helpful.  Now for an alternative suggestion.  Flood & drain requires a timer and the stop & go on the pump will diminish its lifespan;  For less then $15 you can build a bell siphon that doesn't require a timer.  Depending on your growbed size ( and even if you want to go flood & drain ) these bulkheads are fairly nice - http://alliedaqua.com/bulkhead-fitting-slip-inlet-slip-outlet-1-inch.html  Here are two guides I used for building my own  http://www.japan-aquaponics.com/bell-siphon-guide.html  http://www.affnanaquaponics.com/2010/02/affnans-valve-detailed-explanations-of_9459.html  I've preferred Affnan's advice as he goes into a lot more technical details.

aquaponics,2e37za,Jasper1984,6,Wed Aug 20 17:14:03 2014 UTC,There is a maker house here that I'm pretty sure could support this type of print.   You might want to think about a kick starter. You're ahead of 90% of them because you actually have the product produced.
aquaponics,2e37za,gophercuresself,3,Wed Aug 20 17:24:18 2014 UTC,First of all this is really neat because it combines two potential hobbies for which I have absolutely no time for - 3d printing and aquaponics. And it is also great because being able to design and prototype something like this is what 3d printing is supposed to be about - you can test a design or an idea without having to find a shop with the right tools and pay for someone else to do it.

But designing, why not, its pretty fast for me, have a half-assed start.  I dont have a very big print area, i suppose use can always split things up. I was thinking a pole, over which you slide multiple buckets rotated at an angle around the vertical pole, each with a siphon leading to the next. The design is in openscad, the pole can have any profile, just would need to recompile with that profile as input. It is also not complete, there is no of the siphoning part in there yet. When something exactly starts siphoning instead of just overflowing isnt entirely clear to me, i think the outflow must completely envelop the outflow pipe, so air cant go up there."
aquaponics,2e37za,Slimjeezy,6,Wed Aug 20 16:39:43 2014 UTC,"That's awesome, nice work. I don't know a great deal about the process but why would it cost $3800 to get it on Shapeways?   Edit: just reread your caption and it looks like you meant it would cost that much to print (rather than share which is what I'd originally thought).

aquaponics,2e37za,Krystal907,7,Wed Aug 20 18:28:11 2014 UTC,"Yeah even though the model is only 1/16"" thick, the total volume is ~110 cubic inches, which at $1.75/cubic cm (16.4 cu cm/ cu in)means around $3200 base cost.

aquaponics,2e37za,mestupsh0w0ff,5,Wed Aug 20 19:30:23 2014 UTC,It will follow Moore's Law the same as with computing power. Just think how long it took to print a single piece of paper in one of those dot matrix printers in the 80's. 3D printing will follow the same path as 2D printing. Then products like this can be manufactured and re-designed on the fly without the need for ~$100k in startup funding for silly injection molds.   Super frustrating right now though if you have good ideas for physical products but no money to produce them professionally.

aquaponics,2e37za,BrokenByReddit,6,Wed Aug 20 22:45:55 2014 UTC,"This is a great design and exactly what I had wanted for a kitchen top herb garden! I've only got one harsh thing to say and it is coming from the aquarium keeper in me: for the love of God please don't put goldfish in that thing. One goldfish needs at least 20 gallons and a ton of filtration, two needs at least double the gallons. You can't keep very many fish in a 5.5 gallon tank because of the capacity and footprint, which is the biggest issue with using them for aquaponics. Really, a betta is about the biggest thing you can keep humanely. A dwarf african frog would probably work best as they produce a lot of waste and are happy in tanks with plenty of cover.  Back to your design, how much of the tank does the grow bed cover? How much are you thinking of selling these for (sign me up!)? You might want to rethink having an extra light under the grow bed for the aquarium, that is a ton of light for a really small tank and most people would probably end up with huge algae blooms.  I would say pretty much all fish you can keep in a 5.5 gallon tank prefer dim lighting and the intensity of the grow light would most likely be plenty for the whole aquarium. After all, the focus is growing plants on top, not high maintenance plants in the tank that would require nutrient dosing and CO2 anyway if you had that high of light in the thing."
aquaponics,2e37za,Krystal907,4,Wed Aug 20 17:45:02 2014 UTC,"This model is on a standard 10 gallon tank, but will fit on any tank with a 10"" wide opening at the top. The design can be adjusted to any size aquarium really, I used a 10 gallon because it is a basic starter tank most people generally buy.   For the aquarium light- I usually only turn that on when I am at home in the evenings, and haven't found it to produce much algae at all. The plants do a great job at absorbing the nitrates in the water so there is not much left for the algae to live off.    If you are interested I put a pre-sale option on my website to see if people would be interested in purchasing a kit like this. I have talked with manufacturing engineers in the area and they seem to think a $109.95 price is doable sale price."

I would do a Kickstarter but am a little wary because I have done one in the past and failed...

The raft system would be easier to take down than a gravel system. I can't imagine hauling that material upstairs.     For the plastics, you might want to look into farm stores that have watering troughs. Sometimes you can find rectangle plastic troughs used for containment tanks.  Look around your area.

aquaponics,2dqz39,liveradly,6,Sat Aug 16 21:02:36 2014 UTC,"Yes, you can use these - just wash them and test them:  According to the MSDS of BromMax the major toxin is Sodium Hydroxide, which is a water-soluble alkali salt - it's basically lye.  Just wash and scrub the containers. Then take a pH sample of your tap water, it should be just under 8. Fill this container with your tap water, wait 24-48 hours, then see if your pH has adjusted significantly. You might also want to fill a glass with tap water and see if that pH has adjusted in order to account for any irregularities.   If your pH hasn't changed, this container is entirely clean. Check your pH levels for a few days and monitor for changes.   See the LD50 testing on the MSDS to determine how much of this BromMax will kill your fish or algae: 3-5 grams per liter. If this is a 55-gallon drum, and if I've done my math right, you would need a half-pound of BromMax left in the container to kill fish or algae.   However, many folks might be uncomfortable with the thought of using these, but they should be entirely safe if properly cleaned and scrubbed. Also, I'm assuming they're selling these to you entirely empty, as you shouldn't dispose of this stuff down a sewer. Alternatively, you can also consider just getting food-grade drums, which aren't hard to find if you ask around food processing companies."

aquaponics,2dnk9t,MilkCurds,4,Fri Aug 15 18:09:03 2014 UTC,"Please keep this in mind as a disclaimer. I am a first-time tilapia grower, who has had some problems with ""popeye"" a symptom more than a disease.  In my case, it was gram-negative bacterial infections causing fluid buildup in the eyeball and in the eye socket. In my case, ""Fish Sulfa Plus"" is the suggested treatment. It is a combination sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprin. In my case, this has been helping extensively, some fish which had popeye symptoms are much better, and the one fish that has gone blind due to symptoms has lost swelling and is much more active, even for a blind person, than it was.  All that said, Popeye is a SYMPTOM, not a disease. I am a very new grower of fish, and do not claim proficiency at the craft yet. However, if you feel like your bacterial load may be high in your tank for whatever reason - a shade tree dropping garbage in your tank, too many dragonflies stuffing their genitals in your water, spitting into the tank, any number of dead, tiny flies like gnats, mayflies, midges etc. or real animals like mice or squirrels. If you suspect you may have ""germs"" in your tank, I would start with Fish Sulfa Forte/Plus.  Either way, ""popeye"" fish is a good General search term on google for info related to all problems like this. I claim for the last time to be no more than an amateur, but feel like this may be the solution. Good luck to you and your fishies!"

Good water quality for the most part (had one issue where nitrates spiked to 100ppm and I have basic tap water which needs to be brought down each time). However, one day I found one of the fish dead against the pump of the fish tank, with no markings on the fish at all. A couple days later the second one went as well, this time just sitting on the bottom of the barrel. The third fish's activity died completely, and it never came up to feed (floating pellets) for about a week before today (picture). I noticed the eye and googled it and assumed it was popeye so I turned off my airstones to reduce air pressure in the water (about 5 days ago). Today was 14 Celsius (57 Fahrenheit) outside and the week before it was similar temps, could that have played a role?  Ultimately I just am curious as to the source of all of this. I want to make an indoor setup with an aquarium and have the barrel as a sump and reuse the clay pellets. Could this have been a viral/bacterial infection that would contaminate the new system? Thanks."
aquaponics,2dnk9t,paradoxbomb,2,Fri Aug 15 18:17:38 2014 UTC,"I also have goldfish and have dealt with very similar symptoms, all pointing to one cause: hemorrhagic septicemia caused by bacterial infections.  I'm not an expert in fish care, but I can relate what happened to me and what I did about it.  I was successful in treating some of the fish (though not all) by removing them to a hospital tank and treating with API Triple Sulfa.  Use a large tank and some kind of ammonia absorber, because the treatment will kill any beneficial bacteria as well.  This is why you can't treat them in your main tank (unless you don't really care about your biofilter).  Also, I found it useful to do 2 rounds of the treatment (8 days total), even if you don't see any symptoms.  Symptoms were all over the place: some pop-eye, red blotches on tails and fins, not eating, not coming up to the surface, swim bladder probles.  Some of them just died suddenly with no visible symptoms whatsoever.  I'm still dealing with it, so as soon as I see a fish acting funny at all (goldfish should be fairly outgoing at feeding times), it's in to the hospital tank.  Basically, the bacteria that cause the symptoms are everywhere.  Stress from overcrowding, water quality, temperature or pH fluctuations, overfeeding, etc., cause the fish to have weakened immune systems.  Then the infection can set in.  In my case, I think I was fluctuating the pH too much.  Also, you should try to keep your main tank free of any solid waste from extra food or poop during this time. The bacteria can colonize it, then the fish will try to eat it, which will make it spread faster.  Hope that helps, good luck!"

They had eight different actual working established  set ups, and had hydroponics on the other side of the pathway to compare.  The plants didn't do well, because kids and adults kept touching them, so put up a polite, but bold sign.  The coolest part for the kids was actually being able to see the fish, but DO NOT let them feed them.  Make sure you put a screen over the tank, because kids have the dirtiest hands ever, and parents generally don't give a shit.  What was missing from our stand was art.  Kids and adults both love visual communication.  Both also love food.  You can do one of those trivia boards, and have the kids guess things, and lift flaps on a board to see if they got the right answer.  Never underestimate the power of grabbing children's attention.  Most parents there will just move on because their brats are uninterested, and you won't be heard or seen.  Also, bring Swedish fish candies for kids that get the correct answer, give them a single one for trying, but a little packet of three or four if they get answers right.  Put them in little bags, and staple some info to the package.  The kids will eat the candies (swedish fish are also vegan), and the parents will leave with information no matter what.

I've actually gotten a lot more traction with people, by letting them know they can connect to an existing fish tank and have basil and rosemary plants in winter than i ever have describing the huge systems.

A lot of the ""loud"" voices in AP are trying to sell their trainings rather then their produce, and as a result there is a lot of focus around some operations that are not successful commercial farmers.  Some of these farms are quite profitable from their trainings, but not from simply selling produce. Does that mean that it's not possible or wrong? I would say they simply have a different model.

This won't bother alot of fish, especially tilapia, which like alkaline water, but it will cause problems with the plants. If the water is too alkaline, the plants won't be able to absorb iron, which will cause chlorosis.

You don't want to dig so deep that the container is below ground level in case there's a flood (not so common in AZ but worth keeping in mind) and you don't want dirt falling in either.   It's hard to tell exactly how deep to dig without having the whole setup drawn out with the exact supplies you plan to use. Deep enough for at least 2/3 of the container should be sufficient."

Last time, I promise.  Anyway, swamp coolers are pretty straight forward as far as I'm concerned.  I picked one up on craigslist for about $25.  They're great at cooling but also provide much needed humidity.  They also don't use much power at all.  You can even set them up to autofill if so inclined.  By all means, please tell me what you've learned about them. :)  Outside of that I'm actually looking into soap bubble insulation, of all things.  Look up ""soap bubble greenhouse"" and there are some videos out there.  It doesn't look all that complex and apparently shaves a lot off power requirements for heating/cooling no matter what your setup.  Ideally I'd like to have it completely solar powered because where I'm at there is no shortage of sun, but the initial cost is pretty steep."
aquaponics,2dggh8,holyshiznoly,1 point,Wed Aug 13 21:42:08 2014 UTC,"Well I was looking into building a cooler so it's not relevant.  And even then it's a simple tech, there's not much to it besides optimizing results.  Can you tell me offhand if there are working examples of soap bubble GHs in AZ and if they have operating costs available?  I would love to be proven wrong but it seems like it would be cost prohibitive (I mean the electric bill assuming it's not solar powered).  And with respect I have a hard time believing a $25 cooler will make any difference in a GH in AZ unless you set up a triple paned commercial level GH.  I did a quick search for soap bubble Ghs and you're going to have to convince me to look into it more based on what I found http://forums2.gardenweb.com/forums/load/strucs/msg0415373625452.html  Regardless I probably don't have the height required for a GH.   Since it seems the water temp is significantly more important than the air temp (see Rhiba Farms who claim they can grow lettuce all summer with buried reservoirs) I have been trying to come up with a shaded, solar powered evap cooled system.    The biggest indicator for me that GHs are not feasible here is that no one is using them that I can tell, I didn't see a single example of the soap bubble style in AZ (googled ""soap bubble greenhouse"" arizona).  But of course, sometimes conventional methods are irrational and it just takes one person to do something smarter so maybe that will be you."

I had mine for one season and actually had to bring them inside for the winter because they can't stand the cold weather. 56 degrees will kill them. They can stand temps well above 115 degrees.

aquaponics,2dggh8,zynix,1 point,Wed Aug 13 23:58:09 2014 UTC,"Biggest problem I've run into with cooling is copper.  Its generally advised not to use that material anywhere directly connected to system water.  From a past project I experimented with bong coolers which can lower the temperature in arid environments down at the cost of water loss (20% a day).  For my project, a swamp cooler with a exchange woven into the wicking pad was more efficient BUT for AP it's two for one bonus: cooling + another place to develop a biofilter.  Here's one overview of how a bong cooler works - http://wc101.com/guides/bongs  It would take a LOT of water in a reservoir ( say 3x55 gallon drums )  Pros:   Can rapidly cool water without having any metal radiators Hooked up to a reservoir, you can chill a system down close to the dew point ( I'm in Colorado, today ambient is going to be 86F but dew point is going to be 26F ). With an insulated reservoir you would not have to run it all the time. Using high SSA media ( Grow stones, shale, lava rock ) you could turn it into a biolayer/filtration system   Cons:   It needs substantial head pressure which means having a more expensive/extra pump.   While cheap to assemble, it can be ungodly complicated ( I had a 4 tower array that chilled 50 gallon's to cool a rack of servers from 180F to 80F ). By their nature, they're super evaporators and for my 50 gallon system I had to add 10 gallon's a day.  To keep your system stable, you'd need an activated carbon water filter and some sort of passive PH stabilizer ( coral rock, egg shells perhaps? ) More complexity mean's more daily maintenance ( Though perhaps worms in the towers could help on build up )."
aquaponics,2dggh8,zynix,1 point,Thu Aug 14 00:27:57 2014 UTC,How often did you need to refill the system?
aquaponics,2dggh8,Kickaxe,1 point,Thu Aug 14 00:02:25 2014 UTC,"If running continuously every day for a month, it was on par with a 450 CFM swamp cooler ( http://www.h2ouse.org/tour/details/element_action_contents.cfm?elementID=c762fe8a-38b4-4541-907e5203f113d180&actionID=11252fc5-e889-45a5-a088549c8cf50361 ).  But with a larger reservoir, it wouldn't need to be run continuously.  Just enough to get the water back down below ideal because water take's a lot more energy then air to heat up ( flip side, it takes a lot more energy to cool it down ).  Biggest problem I found with every person who experimented with bong coolers is too small of a reservoir and a substantial heat source needing to be cooled ( a rack of 5 servers @ ~500 watts each is basically equivalent to a 2500 watt heating element ).    With an AP system, your two sources of heat is convection by ambient air and radiant heat from the sun.  The majority recommendation in your post has been to bury the tanks.  Go down 3-4 feet and the ground won't go above 80.   Put duckweed or shade clothes over that and you've neutralized both convection & radiant.    If you can't bury them, swamp coolers or bong coolers trade electricity for water."

I don't see any fungal hyphae so I would guess its bacteria.   Edit: I should mention that salicylic acid response looks really close to this. Salicylic acid is thought to be a signaling molecule for what is called Systemic Acquired Response (SAR). This helps the rest of the plant tissues resist infection.     I've not looked it up, but perhaps there have been studies done using foliar applications of salicylic acid (aspirin). Perhaps it can upregulate resistance before infection is observed."

I don't know about you, but 600 fish is a lot of fish compared to my modest 8 at the moment. I think they would barely have any room to move...not to mention to cost.

aquaponics,2d3lbd,Jehovacoin,7,Sat Aug 9 21:49:11 2014 UTC,"Amateur Mycologist here. It looks like a type of slime mold. IDK how it would affect your plants or fish, but I would recommend putting a bit of hydrogen peroxide in the water, or around the area. Peroxide usually will take care of most slime molds, or unhealthy fungi. From the way it looks, I would recommend just turning the pump off, spray it with some 10% peroxide mix and let it sit for 15 minutes before turning the water back on. You will most likely have to do this twice a day for a week before it starts to clear up."
aquaponics,2d3lbd,Jehovacoin,5,Sat Aug 9 21:59:06 2014 UTC,Just 10% of the drug store solution.
aquaponics,2d3lbd,biffthestiff,3,Sat Aug 9 23:31:58 2014 UTC,that's correct.  I also had to pull the pump to do a very good clean with hydrogen peroxide and the hose.  it is slime mold.  How many fish do you have in the water source?

Flush your grow media with garden hose water.  clean out the pump and the tubing that runs to your grow bed. I used hydrogen peroxide mix then flushed it with fresh water.  I think the problem is too much nutrient in the water, and oxygen in the water, ,maybe lack of?  Smarter people than me here would know better."

aquaponics,2d3lbd,Fisheries_Student,-6,Sun Aug 10 22:44:26 2014 UTC,Ack - don't!    If you put hydrogen peroxide in your system it will kill your nitrosomous bacteria and crash your aquaponics system!  I'd take out the balls with the slime mold on them and bleach them.  Then lower the water level so the top inch isn't getting wet.    Aquaponics is an intense enough biological environment that if you knock back the slime mold a bit and deny it the opportunity to get both moisture and light at the same time it'll hopefully lose the battle long-term.
aquaponics,2d3lbd,Jehovacoin,6,Sun Aug 10 16:08:13 2014 UTC,"What, you crazy!  Bleach is going to be much more harmful to your system than hydrogen peroxide.  Bleach will soak into your hydroton, and leave a residue for days if not weeks.  Hydrogen peroxide will decompose almost instantly into water and oxygen.    H202 will certainly not kill beneficial bacteria in your system unless you use literally gallons of it."
aquaponics,2d3lbd,Alacritous,0,Sun Aug 10 04:03:52 2014 UTC,"I think I was unclear.  I meant that you should scoop out the offending media, clean it with bleach, rinse it out, then put it back (with no more bleach on it). I'm curious why it would take gallons of H202 to kill the bacteria but a small amount would kill a slime mold? It's true I haven't tried it, but that's because I've always been told peroxide is an antibacterial."
aquaponics,2d3lbd,pooppate,2,Sun Aug 10 05:36:05 2014 UTC,"Anything in an aquatic system treated with bleach will need a long soak in a dechlorinator solution before being added back to the system.  It's possible that the hydroton will continue to retain bleach even after a dechlorinator is used.   Hydrogen peroxide can be added to ""spot treat"" just about anything unwanted in an aquatic system.  Diatoms, hair algae, slime molds.  Just add a small amount directly to the offending organism.  I was making a point that smart use of small amounts of h2o2 is benign, it would take huge amounts of h2o2 to do any real damage, particularly to the beneficial bacteria that cover literally every surface in the system."
aquaponics,2d3lbd,zynix,-1,Sun Aug 10 20:37:47 2014 UTC,"This is probably better advice, given I do not really know the effects of peroxide on aquaponics ecosystems."

aquaponics,2d3bsv,bythescruff,2,Sun Aug 10 19:01:12 2014 UTC,"Two things:  One, why are you pumping water into the aquarium in the middle as well as into the grow bed on top?  Surely you only need to pump water into the grow bed, which can overflow into the aquarium, which can then overflow into the sump.  You probably don't need to drain from the grow bed directly into the sump, either.  Two, the pipe leading up from the pump has two outlets at two different heights, so unless your pump is way, way more powerful than you need, pretty much all of the water is going to come out of the lower outlet, and very little if any is going to make it to the top one.  I think what you're trying to do could be achieved well by a simple CHIFT PIST system (google it).  Good luck dude.  :-)"

I think having the grow bed where it is in the new design will mean any tall plants will block your view of the aquarium.  Also, this design takes up more floor space than a design which has the grow bed directly above the aquarium. This may help - it's a nice simple design with everything arranged vertically and using a single piece of furniture."

You really don't need anything fancy.

If you don't want to watch the video: The system has a thermal mass like combustion chamber lined with copper coil and a intermediate air exchange ( there's a separate space around the combustion chamber ).  A fan pushes air out of green house and into the stove exchange, then that air comes back.   Additionally two 55 gallon black/TES ( thermal energy storage ) drums draw water from the stove copper exchanger and hold additional heat in them.  Expansion/pressure concerns are dealt with by having both TES drums open.  Lastly, sitting on top of the drums is a concrete slab.  My initial thoughts on an improvement would be to have duct work draw air from near the roof, while the hot air return is vented along one side ( to distribute the heat more evenly ).

I used the API 5 in 1 test kit on my system, and GH levels were ~180 ppm and KH levels were ~240 ppm. 8 pH. The water source is about the same (but with slightly lower pH). I use tap water, but our kitchen sink is fitted with a filter. Only after I run that water through a different filter (Brita filter) does the pH and hardness go down to ideal levels.

I thought it was because his was outside and the rocks he used compacted around the roots when it rained and the wind moved his pants around. When I recommended he change to medium sized pea gravel the next season he didn't have that problem.  Congrats on the good growth!
aquaponics,2cs12y,GeneralDJ,3,Wed Aug 6 11:27:17 2014 UTC,"looks really good, I really like how you used those planks and straps to add support to the tanks.   I'm no expert but it seems like you are on the right track. To bring nutrient levels up, maybe think about getting one or two goldfish that are already mostly grown. My reasoning for that is that adults produce a lot more waste/fertilizer than juveniles; while at the same time it would take many smaller fish to equal the same output now, but later on there would surely be overcrowding.  I'm not sure about the iron supplements for humans, sorry. Here are some other links that may help (if you haven't already found them). An article from bright agrotech on iron. And a thread from the backyard aquaponics forum."
aquaponics,2cs12y,jodunc88,2,Wed Aug 6 14:49:11 2014 UTC,"What's the ammonia level at?  Sounds like you're cycling with the fish in the tank, which (as I've read) could be stressful for the fish and possibly kill them.  This is due to high ammonia levels.  It takes a little time for the right bacteria to build up and convert ammonia->nitrites then nitrites->nitrates.  Even if you've added some bacteria in it will take time for them to establish as grow.  Hope that helps, good luck!"
aquaponics,2cs12y,Terra_Ursidae,2,Wed Aug 6 22:58:16 2014 UTC,"yea if this is a new system, you'll need at least a month before it's stable.   if you know anyone that has a freshwater aquarium, ask them for their used filter.  it'll jumpstart the process greatly and you'll be ready in a week or so to add fish.    and..i can't help but notice....your plants are under your patio umbrella.   they're not getting much sun."

aquaponics,2cs12y,Terra_Ursidae,1 point,Thu Aug 7 12:07:57 2014 UTC,"Using the wet filter brings the desired types of bacteria into your system.  From there they will colonize any surface they can, mostly the media.  If you already added bacteria then you should be fine."
aquaponics,2cs12y,Terra_Ursidae,1 point,Thu Aug 7 16:41:06 2014 UTC,"i dont understand the cycling with the fish in the tank part. yes its only a 2 step system, but is it the water swirling around that stresses the fish or the ammonia levels.   one fish is really into exploring and actually swims into the jetstream the other 2 are just always together being scared of everything that moves. when i look from a distance they do explore the whole tank."
aquaponics,2cs12y,Terra_Ursidae,2,Thu Aug 7 07:42:26 2014 UTC,"Cycling is basically the process of building the bacteria you want in your system.  There are two ways to go about that.  With fish, or without fish.  With fish: the fish release ammonia, which attracts a certain type of bacteria capable of converting ammonia to nitrites.  Now there are nitrites and that attracts another type of bacteria capable of converting that to nitrates.  This process takes a little while (couple weeks probably).  Fish can withstand high levels of nitrates in the water, but they cannot live in high levels of ammonia.  So cycling with fish means they are living in a tank filling with ammonia while bacteria slowly colonize and convert that ammonia.  If the ammonia gets too high for too long they could possibly die.    Cycling without fish is done by using some other form of pure ammonia to start, then waiting until the desired bacteria have colonized and converted all that ammonia into nitrates before adding fish.    Cycling is complete when the ammonia levels are really low to zero and you have higher levels of nitrates.  You should check four levels just about every day until cycling is done.  pH, ammonia, nitrite, and nitrate levels.    The conditions of the tank should be fine.  They should get used to the water swirling, so long as it's not too strong.  I'd be more worried about how much ammonia is in the tank because they can only survive so log in high levels of ammonia."

aquaponics,2cr16i,NotHugeButAboveAvg,0,Wed Aug 6 16:32:18 2014 UTC,Settled concrete = cracks. I'd do the EPDM if I were you. Much more flexibility and less chance of failing. Just my two cents worth.
aquaponics,2cr16i,pounce,2,Thu Aug 7 02:26:48 2014 UTC,"you use an underlayer for the plants/animals, but this option is only suitable if you keep the tank full of water all the time and/or your soil is stable.  The better option is to make a simple retaining wall (earthbags or other cheap solution) to hold the soil wall, and then put a liner in the whole thing.    Pool liners are crazy cheap, but 45 mil fish safe EPDM is cheap and guaranteed for decades, if you use the underlayer."
aquaponics,2cr16i,pounce,2,Wed Aug 6 14:38:23 2014 UTC,"Yeah- dig down. It's a more constant temp when youre down below the frost line. EDPM fish safe liners are about $.65/sqft, as well as Bentonite clay - layer a few inches of it and it will form a waterproof membrane, safe for fish and plants etc. In fact koi people add BC to their koi ponds to help with the coloring patterns on the fish."

I have experience with 2 (6x100) runways with a gradiul depth change of about 5 to 6ft, to entice water flow. Fish injuries are low and the concrete acts like a natural alkaline buffer.  I would go for the concrete, but if you wanted to save money, excavate the space you want and line it with pond liner."
aquaponics,2cr16i,bgw92,3,Wed Aug 6 06:19:58 2014 UTC,"It depends upon what the goals of this facility are and why type of fish you are trying to produce.  If the system is to be geared for commercial fish production your only option is concrete. A liner or shipping container will cause problems and serious headaches. Concrete raceways, when properly formed, allow for flat walls that are relatively square to the floor and a floor that can be sloped to the drain (so that the raceway can be drained). Having flat walls (and relatively square/perpendicular to the floor) will make grading or crowding fish much, much easier. The flat surface of concrete also makes cleaning much easier. If you need to add baffles or ever affix items to the walls, concrete provides a structural means to do so.  Some of these benefits of concrete overlay with benefits of the steel container. The biggest night mare with the container is the corrugated walls (and yes the floors are wood, and treated - do not use exposed to water) that will require a lot of labor to clean.  The corrugations can also created headaches when trying to grade or crowd small fish that can slip around the frame of a crowder and into the corrugations.  While a liner will be the cheapest option upfront, in the long term it will incur the highest labor cost and reduce production capabilities of the tank. If this is a short term tank for a pilot or research study then go for the liner. I'll expand on why you would not want to use a liner for commercial production. You will not be able to dig the walls or floor to any relatively degree of flatness, or squareness relative walls to floor. This will created headaches when trying to crowd or grade the fish. You will not be able to get the wrinkles out of a liner that large (it's one thing when it is a hydroponic raceway (wide and short), but a fish raceway with the depth to width being so similar will be very hard). Wrinkles trap detritus and debris that will need to be cleaned - not very easy to do.  TL:DR Concrete. It will save you a massive headache in the long run. Easier to crowd and grade fish. Easier to clean. Easier to drain. Easier to harvest. Lower labor costs in the long run. Will likely have a higher carrying capacity (fish density) than the other materials."
aquaponics,2cr16i,velacreations,1 point,Wed Aug 6 14:38:56 2014 UTC,"I'll give this another go. This is truly the only option that makes sense to me considering it will be encased in a greenhouse/chicken coup with hydroponics etc located above the tanks. Any sort of repair/redesign down the road will likely be a nightmare imo. I like the hole + pool liner idea because at this point, we need to be done already, but this needs to be done right more than anything. This is a private setup, simply a family trying to avoid the grocery store as much as possible."
aquaponics,2cr16i,JCollierDavis,1 point,Wed Aug 6 16:21:18 2014 UTC,If it is just for a family I would just use an epdm liner. I would guess that they are just doing a batch production where all the fish go in at once and they slowly pull them out as they eat them? What species of fish are you raising? Might look at two raceways if you are planning on restocking and having fish that are quite a bit different in size - especially if these fish are predatory.
aquaponics,2cr16i,JCollierDavis,2,Wed Aug 6 17:48:57 2014 UTC,"Were going concrete, which is honestly a relief. Back to the initial layout of two main tanks, both 4x4x48(4""thickness). The plan it sounds like is focused on talapia with koi and trout as other options. Two tanks are great in addition to redundancy we can pour one, relocate the forms and pour the second. This looks to come to around 30 sheets of plywood and 7.5 yards of concrete each, not too much outside of initial hopes."
aquaponics,2cr16i,fidelitypdx,1 point,Wed Aug 6 19:33:33 2014 UTC,Good choice on the concrete.  Tilapia and trout couldn't be more polar opposite as far as water requirements.  Trout's water temperatures would kill Tilapia - and vice versa. Trout are also going to require a more thorough filtration and aeration system. (Koi float somewhere between the two as far as water quality.) I hope you have a species selected and the support equipment specified and laid out before you start pouring and are locked in.

aquaponics,2ciywo,emerty,3,Mon Aug 4 17:17:57 2014 UTC,"Fish stocking density should be a function of how much growing space you have and not tank size. But of course tank size comes into play as well. One fish per 5 gallons as /u/seekalittlefuther said should be about as high as you plan on going, so you are fine with your 10 or 12 fish there. It takes a much higher level of nitrates to become toxic to fish compared to amonia or nitrite, but it can happen. So you have to have enough filtration to use up all those nitrates. This can be adjusted some by how much you feed the fish, but if you are growing fish as well you want to be feeding them regularly for maximum growth. If fish are a secondary product and not the focus then you can cut back feeding and just have a lower fish yield. Aim for a 2:1 growing space:tank size ratio and you should be using up all your available nitrates.  As for what methods work best, I think it's based on climate and what you wish to grow. I can only speak from my experiences in Florida. I have some beds of Hydroton that are doign well, but my suspended 5"" net pots full of Hydroton are outperforming them. And my PVC NFT tunnels are outperforming them. The plants that are doing best right now are lettuce in the NFT tubes, Cucumbers, Spicy Peppers, and Tomatoes in the suspended net pots."

aquaponics,2ck80s,FishFarmer88,2,Tue Aug 5 04:43:01 2014 UTC,"Hi, Up until last year i was working on a 200 ton a year indoor recirc tilapia farm in the uk, and I'm currently running a mixed species indoor recirc farm (carp, tilapia, clarius catfish and barramundi) at an agricultural college in the uk. (I've also done a fair amount of aquaculture consultancy).  I am currently developing the farm to have an aquaponics element. and have successfully had some test projects in this field.  the media online is shallow at best and the majority of it is wrong.  Also bear in mind most projects cant be scaled up well. a 50 ton a year system cant simply be made 10x bigger to make a 500 ton a year system (this is where a lot of farm designs go wrong).  Ideally you would go to uni and get a degree in it. (not realistic for most due to time).  If it were me i'd probably depending on price go on a week long aquaculture course, (most agricultural colleges do these in the summer, I imagine they have something similar in the US) I would then go on a week long hydroponics course (again at an agri college)  there are an awful lot of sharks in this game and an awful lot of people  who know nothing about it ethier subject yet claim they are aquaponic gurus. at least doing it at an agri college your actually being taught by people who know what there talking about.  I would then send a snail mail letter to every ras farm near me, i know cefas has a list of names and addresses of all aquaculture production businesses here in the uk. (The US must have something similar.) I would then ask them is you could do a few weeks unpaid work experience there.  be upfront with them tell them your considering setting up an aquaponics farm (most recircs have looked into aquaponics they can at least tell you why they didnt opt for it). Most farms will welcome the free labour, and yes you will be doing the crap work but you will be building up your contacts aswell."

aquaponics,2cgjl2,aquaticunicorn,1 point,Sun Aug 3 07:36:32 2014 UTC,Actually I've been adjusting the rocks for flow control to keep a set amount of nutrient water in the grow beds.
aquaponics,2cgjl2,jodunc88,1 point,Sun Aug 3 10:56:55 2014 UTC,"It sounds like you're saying is that you've been experimenting with moving the rocks around to control the rate at which the water flows out of the bin, does that sound correct?  And, it sounds like the flow between all the bins isn't uniform, correct or not correct?  And if correct, and if at all, does that affect the fish?  Thanks for your reply btw!"
aquaponics,2cgjl2,jodunc88,2,Sun Aug 3 20:25:30 2014 UTC,"More or less that sounds correct. The flow between the bins is mostly uniform but not quite, you are correct on that as well.   To compensate for the difference in flow rates the system actually cycles the tank water 4-5 times an hour to compensate. My wife takes levels of the water every day and has found everything to be perfect, so I feel like things are going well."
aquaponics,2cgzgf,notwhelmed,2,Sun Aug 3 02:29:35 2014 UTC,Have you tried Diatomaceous Earth? Does anyone know if it works on slugs? I feel like it should.
aquaponics,2cgzgf,dovy6,1 point,Sun Aug 3 02:43:55 2014 UTC,in my grow bed? i could... not sure what other effects it may have
aquaponics,2cgzgf,zynix,3,Sun Aug 3 02:45:27 2014 UTC,"Its mostly silica http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silica  Problem with using diatomaceous earth is that you need to build a moat around plants so that the slugs have to crawl through it.  That would take a lot of material.    Plus side, it's not a health hazard if ingested but is dangerous if inhaled.  For your beer trap, perhaps use a small dish with beer in the middle and a ring of diatomaceuos earth?  Like a coffee cup plate."
aquaponics,2cgzgf,autowikibot,1 point,Sun Aug 3 04:23:18 2014 UTC,"Silica:       Silicon dioxide, also known as silica (from the Latin silex), is a chemical compound that is a dioxide of silicon with the chemical formula SiO2. It has been known since ancient times. Silica is most commonly found in nature as quartz, as well as in various living organisms,  Silica is one of the most complex and most abundant families of materials, existing both as several minerals and being produced synthetically. Notable examples include fused quartz, crystal, fumed silica, silica gel, and aerogels. Applications range from structural materials to microelectronics to components used in the food industry.

aquaponics,2cfq4x,Kickaxe,2,Sat Aug 2 17:28:33 2014 UTC,I just remembered why I stopped posting to this sub.  You get a bunch of less than correct comments upvoted because they sound good.  You shouldn't 'inject' bacteria into your system at any point in time unless you just have a completely wiped out system.  Test for nitrite daily and do water changes with chlorine free water if the nitrite starts to rise.  Introducing foreign bacteria could potentially start your ecosystem over and worst case scenario it introduces something you don't want in there that will further slow the progress of your mini ecosystems ability to self remediate.  Best case scenario you inject bacteria from a system so similar it marginally advances the process you're trying to optimize.  In a perfect environment every bacteria will become 1 million bacteria in a matter of ~3.5 hours.  The limiting factor here isn't bacteria it's your environment so why would you introduce something to your environment that could potentially offset one of the longer processes?

aquaponics,2cfq4x,adamdreaming,1 point,Sun Aug 3 15:06:11 2014 UTC,"The bacteria also inhabit the aquarium on every surface- substrate, glass, decorations. You're not screwed, but should add bacteria to the filter for several days at least to firmly re-establish the colony in the filter media. There are no downsides to extra bacteria, the excess will die off anyway if they are unsustainable."
aquaponics,2cfq4x,PooperSnooperPrime,1 point,Sat Aug 2 23:40:27 2014 UTC,"look around at a local pond supply store. They'll have pond culture starter kits that include live bacteria.. once you get your system running again, give it a shot of that stuff and you'll be good."

Is there research anywhere at all proclaiming this is healthy, safe, or more productive than traditional aquaponics?  Googling the term anthroponics just leads to a subreddit with like 5 submissions.  I'm inclined to believe its made up..."
aquaponics,2cf143,Greengreenwine,3,Sat Aug 2 15:47:51 2014 UTC,"Hey there, I started that sub as a way to compile all the available information on it. I heard the term anthroponics first from a wastewater engineer who's into aquaponics. It seemed like a better term than peeponics which is used more regularly. If you Google for peeponics you'll find more hits but there's no research whatsoever that I could find. I am the only person in the world that I'm aware of currently doing a master thesis on ""peeponics"". We'd love to have your curiosity and energy over at /r/anthroponics so we can expand the knowledge of it, as I believe the implications are great if used correctly. Right now on the sidebar you'll be able to see all the compiled info I gathered that's relevant for anthroponic systems"

aquaponics,2cf143,hellbent64,2,Sat Aug 2 15:37:42 2014 UTC,Feces and Urine based Anthoponics could be generalized and made co-children of Livestock farming. Remember that guy who made his swimming pool into a producing pond and had his chickens crap into it? I also heard about putting rabbit cages above aquaponics system tanks.  Also vermiaquaponics.
aquaponics,2cf143,hellbent64,2,Sat Aug 2 16:36:02 2014 UTC,I think vermiaquaponics is the same as bioponics if you define it (as I did) as aquaponics + helpful organisms such as worms+ladybugs+bsf+fungi etc which turn an aquaponics system into a more resilient ecosystem
