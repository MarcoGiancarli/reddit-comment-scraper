Normally expressed as an elevation in feet and horizontal visibility in statute miles. It varies on each approach but will usually look like 750-1 which would be 750 feet and one mile. Most commercial flights are not allowed to begin a flight if there destination weather is not at least at or above the lowest minimums available on a usable approach.   The weather that this bad ass landed in is usually referred to as zero-zero, or clouds are on the ground/sea and zero horizontal visibility.

aviationgifs,33v9pr,gfmsfootball6560,20,Sun Apr 26 01:10:20 2015 UTC,I would think it's a stool they use to support it when they need to work on the front landing gear.
aviationgifs,33v9pr,nittanyRAWRlion,9,Sun Apr 26 01:18:38 2015 UTC,That makes so much sense.  I don't know why it was so baffling to me.  Every way I could think about it I kept coming back to the nose wheel flying off on every other flight or so.
aviationgifs,33v9pr,gfmsfootball6560,5,Sun Apr 26 01:21:41 2015 UTC,Did he have an engine malfunction associated with this? I noticed a flash in his intake that occurs at approximately the second nose bounce on the stand. Perhaps a compressor stall or something?

aviationgifs,32hn0n,TheTattedspyder,3,Tue Apr 14 01:42:16 2015 UTC,Needs washing afterwards as sand is really abrasive to aircraft components. Also need to poke sand with a stick to make sure it's OK beforehand and make sure water isn't too deep.

aviationgifs,2y77f4,PrudeHawkeye,11,Sat Mar 7 02:38:32 2015 UTC,Finland apparently has roads that are specially cleared and surfaced to allow for small aircraft/jets to take off and land if necessary.

aviationgifs,2y77f4,jd0509,6,Sat Mar 7 04:43:43 2015 UTC,My guess is that the road was designed to be able to be used as an improvised runway during emergencies. So it would make sense that they test it for this purpose
aviationgifs,2y77f4,Kogster,11,Sat Mar 7 04:15:45 2015 UTC,"Not really for emergencies.  Sweden has a lot of these as well.

aviationgifs,2xpaxm,Don_Quijoder,1 point,Fri Mar 6 18:10:36 2015 UTC,"The ailerons actually work in tandem.  So if one goes up by a certain amount, the other goes down by the same amount.  This is the same whether you're in a fly-by-wire aircraft or an ultralight.    No computer  needed as those controls are physically linked in aircraft that don't even have any kind of computer compensation.

aviationgifs,2vivre,jjm3210,6,Wed Feb 11 16:16:47 2015 UTC,They probably aren't as high as you think. Notice that there aren't engines mounted on the pylons. The lack of weight on the wings would make this easier since the weight and balance are vastly different from an in service aircraft. All the hydraulic fluids and fuel was likely drained as well making the effect that much greater.
aviationgifs,2vivre,Navypilot1046,2,Wed Feb 11 19:00:18 2015 UTC,"When I learned fueling for the 747 we were instructed very carefully to fill up the wing tanks and the rear trim tanks at a certain ratio in order to avoid this exact thing happened.   Granted this plane has no engines and likely no fluids, but filling the tanks in the back of that thing would tip it backwards."

aviationgifs,2uqwhy,streletz,4,Wed Feb 4 14:56:11 2015 UTC,The hook touches the runway before the wheels do.
aviationgifs,2uqwhy,nupogodi,5,Wed Feb 4 18:59:11 2015 UTC,The cable is also low enough on the deck that it is below the center of the wheel so as the wheel is rolling down the deck it pushes any cables it encounters down and rolls right over them.

aviationgifs,2udqfa,fingermydickhole,1 point,Sun Feb 1 13:33:02 2015 UTC,"When taking off into a crosswind, takeoff with the upwind wing (yoke turned into the wind) low. Use coordinated aileron and rudder to turn into the wind and establish a crab into the wind.  Using only rudder to correct will cause unnecessary profile drag and the takeoff will be uncoordinated. Neither of these are desired in a low airspeed and high pitch attitude close to the ground.  tldr: Aileron into the wind, coordinated rudder"

Does it vaporise, or would it fall to the ground like drops of rain? If it's the latter, wouldn't that cause serious ground contamination?"
aviationgifs,2roq1t,straycanoe,12,Thu Jan 8 01:25:57 2015 UTC,"Given that jet fuel is highly volatile, it almost certainly vaporizes and disperses."
aviationgifs,2roq1t,BrokeDiamond,8,Thu Jan 8 01:48:20 2015 UTC,"Jet fuel isn't actually as volatile as you seem to think.   I could take a lit match and throw it into a bucket of jet fuel and absolutely nothing would happen. It's only once 100.4° F is reached that jet A gives off enough fumes to be able to be ignited. When it does though, there is a lot of energy."
aviationgifs,2roq1t,jjm3210,1 point,Thu Jan 8 15:38:26 2015 UTC,"A bucket vs. a mist at altitude. Lots more surface area and time to interact.  Is 100.4F the flashpoint?

aviationgifs,2roq1t,jjm3210,2,Thu Jan 8 22:22:57 2015 UTC,"Flash point:       The flash point of a volatile material is the lowest temperature at which it can vaporize to form an ignitable mixture in air. Measuring a flash point requires an ignition source. At the flash point, the vapor may cease to burn when the source of ignition is removed.  The flash point is not to be confused with the autoignition temperature, which does not require an ignition source, or the fire point, the temperature at which the vapor continues to burn after being ignited. Neither the flash point nor the fire point is dependent on the temperature of the ignition source, which is much higher.  The flash point is often used as a descriptive characteristic of liquid fuel, and it is also used to help characterize the fire hazards of liquids. ""Flash point"" refers to both flammable liquids and combustible liquids. There are various standards for defining each term. Liquids with a flash point less than 60.5 or 37.8 °C (140.9 or 100.0 °F) — depending upon the standard being applied — are considered flammable, while liquids with a flash point above those temperatures are considered combustible.

My trainer told me of a story where a 747 had to dump something like 100,000 pounds of fuel (they hold several hundred of thousands, can't remember the exact number) immediately after take off to get down to a happy landing weight.  Unfortunately, at this airport the planes take off directly over a suburb and the fuel fell atop houses and cars, resulting in NWA (at the time) having to replace the roofs and windshield of many residents.

Due to this aero plane not having wheels and us not knowing the speed of the headwinds that day, I had to guess... The truck had to be doing about 60mph.  That's being very generous with a 20mph headwind to help generate lift.

aviationgifs,2mx4j3,SierraEcho,4,Fri Nov 21 13:11:53 2014 UTC,Well he was landing so we can assume that the engine was on idle or very close to it.
aviationgifs,2mx4j3,ttothees,3,Fri Nov 21 19:01:41 2014 UTC,Usually with jet engines you don't want to run them completely idle because they take a while to generate thrust so just in case you need to go around you want to keep at least a little thrust in until just before you flare
aviationgifs,2mx4j3,whysoseriousgtr,1 point,Fri Nov 21 20:52:41 2014 UTC,"On an airfield with an F-16? Not so much. If you had to, for some odd reason, do a go around...it would make plenty of power quickly. An F-18 on the boat? Yeah, they keep some throttle going AND when they grab the wire they go max throttle just in case they missed the wire, they can take off again and go around."
aviationgifs,2mx4j3,Tarron,3,Tue Apr 7 00:40:07 2015 UTC,"That is quite dangerous.   I imagine this to be a quite short runway because of the landing altitude. If he suddenly has abort landing because of various reasons, he'll have to throttle up. If you stand directly behind then you can get serious burns. This can either give the spectators burns, or cause him to do drastic measures to avoid this, these can then force him out of radical solutions."

It was for an airshow and yes he was low,  but as previously discussed the pilot should be able to do what he damn well pleases and if the idiots who ignore all the warning signs and flashing red lights (much like at St Maarten) suffer as a result then that's their problem IMO."

Over the target, while on the bomb run, this B-24 was hit by anti-aircraft fire between the inboard #2 engine and fuselage, causing the left wing to fold, then break off. The fuselage fell in a flat spiral until it crashed.  Fates of the Crew Declared dead the day of the mission, the entire crew was killed in the crash, with the exception of Kaufman. He was captured by the Japanese an executed.""  ""Pat Scannon adds: ""There is a myth about an American bomb striking the wing. We dispelled when Dan got his superbly cleaned up version. When looking frame by frame (which I have done for hours), one can see no bomb strike the wing (although you can see plenty of bombs falling from above, as he points out) and one can clearly see the wing explode from below. Even the vets from 494th go back and forth on this but it all happened so fast that the only way to tell is by examining the cleaned up film. The wing streaming fuel in that footage is also from this same B-24. Dan O'Brien found that footage with the better known wing collapse footage."""""

aviationgifs,2dvgd4,WILLYOUSTFU,11,Mon Aug 18 13:07:45 2014 UTC,"It's actually pretty tough to tell from this gif who's at fault. Looks like the helo was making an approach to a taxiway and turned off immediately. We don't know who had what clearance, if any.  edit: So after watching this, it's clear the helicopter is landing on a runway. And as per the AIM;   b. Taxi clear of the runway unless otherwise directed by ATC. An aircraft is considered clear of the runway when all parts of the aircraft are past the runway edge and there are no restrictions to its continued movement beyond the runway holding position markings. In the absence of ATC instructions, the pilot is expected to taxi clear of the landing runway by taxiing beyond the runway holding position markings associated with the landing runway, even if that requires the aircraft to protrude into or cross another taxiway or ramp area. Once all parts of the aircraft have crossed the runway holding position markings, the pilot must hold unless further instructions have been issued by ATC.   The helicopter taxis clear of the runway, past the hold short and continues onto the taxiway. The question of who had what clearance remains. It's possible both aircraft had clearance to taxi at that same time, possibly implicating the controller. The airplane may not have had clearance where the helicopter did, leaving the airplane at fault. The tower could be closed, so no clearances were issued, which would probably implicate the helicopter, as he did not make sure the taxiway was clear before turning out of an intersection. Not to mention the airplane was to his right, which usually has right of way.   Regardless of all that, it was in Germany. So who the hell knows."
aviationgifs,2dvgd4,BrolecopterPilot,2,Mon Aug 18 19:50:00 2014 UTC,Both are pretty stupid for taxiing as fast as they both were. Both should have been traveling about about half the speed they were.

aviationgifs,28vryz,chukies,5,Thu Jul 3 12:40:28 2014 UTC,"It will leave it as a sitting duck largely because you would have to slow down the aircraft significantly to fall into a safe zone given the forces that would be exerted. If you did do a maneuver slow enough to fall into the safe zone, a gun or radar guided missile could easily take it out.  However, a lot of air show stunts do actually have a major practical purpose,  just not as often in modern aircraft. For instance, in WW2 initiating what is basically a drift in the plane looks fairly nice to a crowd but it also bled a lot of speed and often forced a close enemy to accidentally over shoot unless a similar maneuver was initiated."

Anyway the technicians could have decreased the rotor speed while undergoing the test to ensure that the resonance didn't come to a point where it was dangerous.   I think this went wrong on purpose.

This was not about blades themselves being unbalanced but inducing ground resonance.  There is an inherent fault with odd bladed heads where, without adequate shock absorption, two blades will get too close to each other and become so unbalanced it will rip itself apart.  This was a test where the chinook was strapped directly to the ground with no shock absorption.

From this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZiL6l4oCrg  Basically they wanted the plane to be able to take off and land in a soccer stadium for hostage rescue in Iran. I don't think the video goes into more detail than that, but here is the wikipedia page for Operation Creditable Sport."
aviationgifs,2734gx,autowikibot,3,Mon Jun 2 06:40:57 2014 UTC,"Operation Credible Sport:       Operation Credible Sport was a joint project of the U.S. military in the second half of 1980 to prepare for a second rescue attempt of the hostages held in Iran using a Lockheed C-130 Hercules airlifter modified with the addition of rocket engines. Credible Sport was terminated when on November 2, the Iranian parliament accepted an Algerian plan for release of the hostages, followed two days later by Ronald Reagan's election as the U.S. President.   Its follow-up project in 1981–82, Credible Sport II, used one of the original aircraft as the YMC-130 prototype for the MC-130H Combat Talon II.

aviationgifs,2734gx,kubes,5,Tue Jun 3 02:25:43 2014 UTC,"OP answered your question well regarding the particular aircraft in the gif, but in addition, the rocket assisted takeoff has been used on the C-130 and other aircraft for many years to enable takeoffs in situations that would otherwise be impossible such as short strips, heavy loads, etc. The JATO/RATO units are solid-fuel rocket canisters strapped to the sides of the aircraft, so they're not really wasting any of the aircraft's onboard fuel (other than a slight weight/drag penalty).  Here's a video of an LC-130 using them to take off from a strip in Antarctica, and here's one showing the Blue Angels' ""Fat Albert"" doing it's awesome JATO airshow takeoff demo."

I wonder how the outcome of the hostage rescue would have been different if they had used them in the attempt.  Here's some pics of the sister ship (YMC-130H) to the one in the gif that I took at the Museum of Aviation in Warner Robins, GA some years ago. They show all of the added brackets for the JATO units pretty well. It's kind of hard to see in the pics, but also note the extended leading edge of the horizontal stabilizers."

The reason being that the act that you can pour tea has nothing to do with the ailerons. The elevator is the control unit that controls the pitch of the aircraft. Without this, there wouldn't be generated enough g force to make the liquid go into the cup.   A clean aileron roll will simply pour the liquid everywhere.   This is an Aileron roll:  http://www.flightsimbooks.com/f15strikeeagle/061_1.jpg  This is what the pilot (In the movie) has performed:  http://www.flightsimbooks.com/f15strikeeagle/063_1.jpg  A little smoother though.

aviationgifs,25cnxv,siac4,3,Tue May 13 05:33:32 2014 UTC,"When it's on the ground, it has 2 little wheels (pogos) on each wing that keep it stable. It also uses these to take off. When it's landing, the plane's speed keeps it stable, untill it slows down enough that it can deploy these little wheels to keep it stable Take a look: http://www.aerospaceweb.org/aircraft/recon/u2/u2_26.jpg"
aviationgifs,25cnxv,siac4,3,Tue May 13 06:13:04 2014 UTC,But why? Weight radar signature airframe design? It just seems that the ground is the biggest danger for a plane. This seems to be unnecessarily dangerous.
aviationgifs,25cnxv,twelveparsex,6,Tue May 13 17:11:41 2014 UTC,"It is extremely dangerous, that's why the chase car is there.  There is almost no visibility from the cockpit"
aviationgifs,25cnxv,siac4,4,Sat May 17 16:11:36 2014 UTC,"It was designed and manufactured for minimum airframe weight, so I guess they had to save on the weight. It is one of the hardest plane to land, and before you can even fly one, they do lots of landing training, and give you the tapes. Theres a good video on youtube where they show how difficult it is to land it. A car always has to follow it while landing."

aviationgifs,2580cc,CMSTerraNova,2,Sat May 10 18:10:56 2014 UTC,I assume that there is a speed limitation as to when you can deploy the parachutes unless you do it in stages. It must be difficult to build or impeachable because It would be an obvious safety precaution for every passenger and cargo airline.

Evidence: http://cdn2.spiegel.de/images/image-65719-galleryV9-xnin.jpg  It was Lufthansa Flight LH 044 on 1st of March, 2008 trying to land in Hamburg, Germany. The reason was a computer error. The A320's computer switched to ground mode after the first short ground contact which limited the angle the rudder could be moved by the pilots. With this they could not fight against the crosswind anymore. This behaviour of the computer was not documented in the manual. Airbus improved the manual and flight computer software afterwards.  The 24 year old co-pilot was flying the plane at that moment, so at first media blamed her."

The airport serves as a hub for Windward Islands Airways and is the major gateway for the smaller Leeward Islands, including Anguilla, Saba, St. Barthélemy and St. Eustatius. It is named after Juliana of the Netherlands, who as crown princess landed here in 1944, the year after the airport opened. There is also an airport on the French side of the island, called Aéroport de Grand Case or L'Espérance Airport.
