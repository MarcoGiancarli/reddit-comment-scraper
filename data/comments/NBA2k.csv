NBA2k,3e12aa,Jayc333,24,Tue Jul 21 05:20:32 2015 UTC,"""Randomness"" just isn't pleasant when a computer is clearly just pulling strings.  I understand that 2K is trying to replicate the unpredictability of a real down-to-the-wire game, but the result is feeling like you never deserve to win, or lose, a close game.    I once was teaching my little cousin how to play, and he had a one point lead with five seconds to go.  I decided to throw the game for him to get his first win, so I had Jerry West take a contested fadeaway long-two with the button held way too long.  And it went in.  He never wanted to play again."
NBA2k,3e12aa,siphillis,-8,Tue Jul 21 07:30:33 2015 UTC,I know this subreddit likes to circlejerk around this but catch-up logic just doesn't exist in NBA 2K15 no matter how many times people blame their own poor play on it. Classic case of confirmation bias.

I lucked out my first season, but my second season I suffered a loss to Cleveland in the ECF.  Cleveland was just way too much for my team to overcome.  Then the third year, you get to chose two all stars you want recruited to your team, and then they join your team, and then you'll have the best team the NBA has ever seen.  This is the narrative."

I already have anthony davis on the pelicans. Too bad he misses 75% of his layups from pick and rolls and they only talk about Eric Gordon as if he was Michale Jordan.  Or maybe I should ask Andrew Bogut. Thus far, he does between the leg step back jumpers against Davis and then gets the O rebound for an And-1 every other posession."

The game also seems to have a habit of your best teammates getting injured your first years, to force you to carry the team by yourself and rack up VC, so he may be playing with an injury right now for you.  I recruited Anthony Davis to my Knicks, and I utilize his close range shot more than anything."

I'll rack up 30 odd points in the first half on a ridiculous percentage, but then miss every shot AND layup in the 2nd.

NBA2k,3e0w6e,HarryLundt,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:59:41 2015 UTC,"I like playing on 12 minute quarters because I get way more VC and can usually get at close to an A+ teammate grade nearly every game, but at the rate I play 2k, it would take months to finish one 60-odd game season.   I prefer playing 6 minute quarters because, even though it feels more rigged and MyPlayer doesn't get as good as quickly, I at least can finish a couple seasons before the next game comes out."
NBA2k,3e0w6e,wirelessthetireless,2,Tue Jul 21 14:11:08 2015 UTC,"FYI, you actually make more VC by playing shorter games because the amount of VC you get for playing the game remains the same, whether with 6 minutes quarters or 12 minute quarters.  (Not the VC you earn in-game for stats, but for playing the game, period.)"
NBA2k,3e0w6e,jma1024,2,Tue Jul 21 18:36:11 2015 UTC,"Yeah I understand that. I've started turning down game time to 8 minute quarters just so I can get through my first season faster, but it's still starting to be a bit of a slog.  But if I had to choose between being bored or enraged by the game, I'd probably choose the former personally. But it's still finding ways to annoy me either way."

NBA2k,3e0w6e,narutoendinggenjutsu,2,Tue Jul 21 04:21:01 2015 UTC,"I'm playing on the 2nd hardest one I think.  I just stick to whoever the coach tells me to guard. Usually the PG but they put me at SG half the time too.   I hate it cause there are times when it's OBVIOUS that the computer has ""decided"" that my guy WILL score. What happens is my guy literally runs into the key, then back out. Then back into the key. Then back out. Then back in. Then back out. Eventually I get stuck in an animation and he will catch his backdoor pass at the elbow and then hit a layup all without dribbling. So frustrating.  Other than that, IF I can stop their drive. They just pass it off to someone who hits a 3 with 2 sec left.  I guess the thing that upsets me is how the computer hits contested 3 pointers or their big men will do between the leg spin moves. We're talking about Kelly olynyk and Kendrick Perkins doing fadeaways.  That's one thing I don't like so far. In this game, ""worse"" players will still do the same moves that good players do, just their ""rating"" is lower. Like there's no way that Andrew Bogut should be able to do a between the legs cross over and then pump fake step through past Anthony Davis. Yet he will do it 5x in the game and make 2-3 of them."

I only started on Rookie to have an easier time getting a bunch of badges that had been eluding me with every other player I made and it's sickeningly boring getting 40 to 50 points a game.  I went to the Pacers my second year and I just put up a 23/23 FG game where only 6 shots were dunks/layups."

NBA2k,3dxufr,Alex_1404,58,Mon Jul 20 12:42:37 2015 UTC,There are no 3 second calls when you are playing at a park in real life. They should just allow you to boxout the person holding themselves ln the paint.
NBA2k,3dxufr,nebelias,10,Mon Jul 20 14:25:09 2015 UTC,"Maybe the solution could be like in real life - if someone camps under the basket waiting for a rebound, his opponent can use force to push him out and the camper needs to apply reverse force to stay put. So maybe there should be some battle with holding L2 and moving the stick the right way.  That way you can also ""pull the chair under"" a post-up move."
NBA2k,3dxufr,defsubsucks,6,Mon Jul 20 14:42:02 2015 UTC,Pulling the chair is one of my favorites. It's so funny every time it happens.
NBA2k,3dxufr,thatonedude123,2,Mon Jul 20 15:34:41 2015 UTC,This should be in regular games too.  I like the pulling the chair idea as well.  Come on 2K!
NBA2k,3dxufr,markseesred,4,Mon Jul 20 18:46:47 2015 UTC,"Bothered me at first, but you can fight back. It should be a battle under the boards, learn to time your move with the shooter. Also helps to have the board stat maxed out."
NBA2k,3dxufr,ALL_CAPS,4,Mon Jul 20 15:23:10 2015 UTC,"If there is a defender camping like a statue in the paint, doesn't that just short his team a defender and guarantee you wide ooen shots on offense?"
NBA2k,3dxufr,HarryLundt,14,Mon Jul 20 18:29:18 2015 UTC,Yeah if your teammates on my park understand the concept of passing

NBA2k,3dxufr,HarryLundt,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:46:48 2015 UTC,"Nah, on PC guys use this tactic on offense and defense.  A lot of guys use body mods and cheats, so it's difficult to body them in any type of situation whether it's on the perimeter or in the paint."

NBA2k,3dxufr,LtTom,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:59:03 2015 UTC,"You can combat this, but you and your teammates all need to be on the same page.  A lot of times the cheesers have no concept of basketball fundamentals so you can use your positioning to ""seal"" the guy if he gets too deep in the paint.  That way, when they release their pick to grab the rebound, there will be a small delay due to your body being on them.  However, the other two guys on your team need to help out on the boards and time their jumps right because otherwise these 7'7"" guys can still tip the ball to their team."

NBA2k,3e1har,HotzenplotzRobbery,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:38:31 2015 UTC,"Cool project. Will be interested to see what your Warriors lineup ends up being.  Here's a suggestion:  http://2kmtcentral.com/lineups/edit/16923  Parish just clears the bar for playing significant time for the Warriors and being very good while doing so.  Other guys you could consider who are also in the game are Sleep Floyd, Antawn Jamison, Jason Richardson, and if you loosen requirements up, maybe World B. Free, Bernard King, Jerry Lucas, Stephen Jackson, John Starks, Terry Cummings.  What are you using to make the roster?"
NBA2k,3e1har,HarryLundt,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:29:40 2015 UTC,"I'm using the in-game roster editor with mostly 2khead.com and sometimes  2kmtcentral as a reference. Are all of those players you mentioned suggestions for only the Warriors or just the game in general? Right now my warriors lineup is Steph Curry, Klay Thompson, Chris Mullin, Stephen Jackson, Al Harrington, Monta Ellis, Jason Richardson, Draymond Green, Harrison Barnes, Alton Lister, and Sarunas Marciulionis.  A lot of those guys you mentioned I have in the roster but on other teams. Parish is on the Celtics, but I could move him since the Celtics are really stacked right now. I didn't know Antawn Jamison was in the game. I'll have to take a look. He'd be good on my fairly weak Wizards team. Thanks for the suggestion!"
NBA2k,3e1har,HarryLundt,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:41:27 2015 UTC,"Ah, okay...FYI there are edit/hack tools on PC that would probably make this a much easier project, though you'd have to learn how to use the tools first.  On the lineup suggestion: that was my suggestion for an All-Time Warriors lineup.  I wasn't thinking about how you are using in-game roster editing, so you can't duplicate player cards and you can't access Gems.  With these restrictions, it's a heck of a lot tougher to put these teams together, unless you go through the trouble of making a heck of a lot of players.  But it's also an interesting exercise to restrict things so that a player can only be on one All-Time team."
NBA2k,3e1har,HarryLundt,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:53:51 2015 UTC,"I have used cheat engine to make duplicate players. For example I have Chris Bosh on both the Raptors and the Heat as well as Steve Nash on the Mavs and Suns. But you're right, lots of character creation. I can't duplicate player cards per se, but I can create a new character, apply their cyberface with cheat engine and then copy the stats of whichever card I want from 2khead.com. That's how I made a all of the players that aren't in the normal lineup.  Which tools are out there that I can use? If it will make this less time consuming, I'd love to know what's at my disposal."

You might also find it helpful to watch videos on how the plays in that offense, such as motion weak, look like in the NBA. The problem with all the freelance offenses in 2k15 is that it takes time for the CPU to initiate plays and for everybody to set up, which wastes valuable seconds. If you let me know what you feel is random/hard to use, I might be able to give you some pointers."

Onyx is more expensive, but not sure if it's worth it. His gold card will serve as a good backup if you decide to go for a major card at PF. Maybe you could even play onyx Marion at the 4? He's athletic, good defender, decent rebounder, and can shoot 3s. His only knock is that he lacks height at the 4.

NBA2k,3dqvxw,lmhTimberwolves,10,Sat Jul 18 21:32:31 2015 UTC,In 2K12 online leagues it used to be a big deal to sign Greg Oden ASAP off of free agency because he's perfectly healthy in the game

NBA2k,3dqvxw,doodypoo,6,Sun Jul 19 04:38:44 2015 UTC,"I think one way to solve this problem would be to have potential go lower than the players overall, at least for draft picks. It's sensible that a player's potential can't be lower than his overall, but I think this is an easy and quick fix for draft classes. And maybe to negate the ability to know how well a player will do in the long run, there is no access to the potential rating until after you drafted the player.   So maybe you're drafting 50th overall, without access to the potential rating during scouting, you would be inclined to draft the highest overall player. Maybe this player's potential is really high and is a diamond in the rough. Maybe you're drafting first and you do draft that Greg Oden player and waste your pick when you could have had KD. I also think that once you get past the lottery, the chance that a player is a bust should decrease, and there shouldn't be too many players that turn out to be a diamond in a rough."

Once you level up, it doesn't matter what team you pick as all your players go up crazy amounts to the point you have a whole roster of 90s. To stress how extreme this is I won 7 straight championships with the twolves from the first year on."
NBA2k,3dqvxw,iidesune,2,Sun Jul 19 03:50:37 2015 UTC,I think an easier solution is to just not reveal a player's potential.
NBA2k,3dqvxw,DirtMaster3000,2,Sun Jul 19 13:04:31 2015 UTC,"I think the best solution to this would be to get rid of the potential rating all together and increase players ratings based on their performance in games, similar to what Madden did. If you have a rookie that's just a scoring machine then his ratings should go up no matter his overall or potential rating, or better yet, they should give the players XP let us pick what ratings we want to increase.  If I draft a guy anywhere from like 15th-60th that's excellent on defense but not a good offensive player I want to be able to develop his shooting abilities and have him turn into a good 3&D player. Maybe that's all that he'll ever be and that's fine, because I would rather have him than some player that's still just a good defender but slightly better but still not good in all other areas. Maybe there could be a slight chance that he has something like A or B potential because sometimes great players are found in the 2nd round, but those should be very few and far between, and they certainly shouldn't turn into players of MJ or LeBron caliber.  In addition to this, Potential ratings shouldn't be the only thing to dictate whether or not a player can ever be good in the NBA. It should reflect how much XP a certain player earns for their performances. Maybe a player with A potential can earn 6 XP for every point they score, while someone with F potential only earns 1 or 2. Of course you wanna give out points for a lot of things like AST, REB, BLK and STL, but also for things like a good contest on defense or other things that don't show up on the stat sheet like points and rebounds do.  Now these point values are just arbitrary and I don't know if they are in any way balanced, and how much different attribute upgrades should cost, but that's 2Ks job to find a balance. They've done it before when MyPlayer/MyCareer was based on Skill Points instead of VC, and I'm sure they can implement that into MyLeague/MyGM with a bit of effort. It's just a question of whether they're willing I think."

NBA2k,3dspd2,bluenanfrost,6,Sun Jul 19 02:15:15 2015 UTC,"I downloaded a custom roster and edited the players to match their cards ratings, put them on them on the Warriors (since I use their playbook) and use freestyle/scrimmage to practice their shots, moves, plays etc."
NBA2k,3dspd2,AlphaPack,1 point,Sun Jul 19 02:45:54 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the summary. I figured that's the only way. Are there no custom rosters that have all of the players in MyTeam, with ratings/badges consistent?"

NBA2k,3dspd2,HarryLundt,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:46:18 2015 UTC,"Np man, it's not hard at all just a bit time consuming to edit. I find it super helpful to make it hof Sim and just scrimmage an edited bulls team with Iverson, mj, pip, Tim Duncan, and Shaq"
NBA2k,3dspd2,AlphaPack,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:51:19 2015 UTC,"That makes a lot of sense.  I'm hoping that someone has made a custom roster that contains everyone in MyTeam...would have assumed that this would be pretty far up the priority of ""community"" rosters, along with non-included historic players and rookies.  Edit: If you're making custom rosters anyway, why not make a team composed of the types of teams you face in RttP, instead of a real 2015 team?  Oh, wait...I guess one can't duplicated players.  But...one could just make ""Jebron Lames"" totally custom player with same stats as Lebron James, right, and assign him to a team long with ""Mao Ying"" et al, right?"
NBA2k,3dspd2,HarryLundt,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:04:42 2015 UTC,"Okay, thought more about this and did some noodling around and understand now that my initial question was kind of silly.  Didn't realize that, for Freestyle/Scrimmage, one can load a custom roster that is created from within the game.  So even though I can't practice with Gem versions of players, use players that are not associated with full teams, or with the actual Badges I have on my versions, at least I can practice using the default incarnations of players in customized/mixed lineups.  And I guess, if I can find a database of animations each player has, I could just add in Gem versions through Create a Player, especially since, for practice, I don't care about how they look.  We're talking about practice, after all; not a game.  Practice."

NBA2k,3dr196,fuentesf51,2,Sun Jul 19 04:46:26 2015 UTC,I was the opposite. He would not shoot with me in NBA2K13.

NBA2k,3dr196,Chris13Haughey,23,Tue Jul 21 01:21:22 2015 UTC,"Chris Paul is the worst PG teammate ever. Throws lobs almost every possession, and most of em end up sailing right out the baseline.  Steph Curry is a good PG teammate, but he doesnt stop at the top of the 3-point line like most PGs. He always drives and pulls up for a mid range jumper. I would be mad about not getting touches, but they go in, so I cant complain haha"
NBA2k,3dr196,MooseNoodles,7,Sat Jul 18 19:10:27 2015 UTC,"Yeah I'm a SF on the Hawks and Teague does the same exact thing, but it always goes in so okay. Sefalosha though is a bog hog and can't shoot worth shit so fuck that.   Also Kyle Korver makes me irrationally angry. Never makes my open look threes to him, always makes it when Teague tosses it to him. I swear getting a triple double in this game is harder than real life."
NBA2k,3dr196,A_Confused_Cocoon,1 point,Sat Jul 18 20:26:07 2015 UTC,"I had a PG on the Hawks too and it was the same shit with me. I fucking hated Sefalosha. He's standing at the three point line and can't shoot at all. I actually liked Teague because they'd play me at SG and he'd make threes if I gave the ball to him with like 3 seconds left, haha.   Getting triple doubles is hard only because of assists. Scoring is easy. Rebounding is easy. Assist are always my biggest challenge. The passing in the same is probably worse than previous 2Ks. Why is making a simple pick and roll pass so damn hard? Good shooters also never shoot in this game. However, it gets easy once you get On Court Coach by maxing out playmaking and outside shooting. You get the ball instantly if you call for the pass, they shoot instantly and you can call plays. Only problem is how long it takes to get though. It's like 80k VC or something like that."
NBA2k,3dr196,strifeblood,3,Sat Jul 18 21:56:36 2015 UTC,Curry never passed when i was with golden state. And for some reason he loved to dunk.

Dude would ballhog and jack up shots like you wouldn't believe, costing us so many games. AD and Omer not being able to rebound in 2K15 were frustrating, but Delfino was on a whole other level of shit. Royce White was more productive than he was. It was bad.  EDIT: Got Delfino confused with Francisco Garcia. Garcia was also far better than Delfino."

I played on the Raptors and he had to play behind Derozan but since he left Martin has been getting more PT, maybe he'll do better."
NBA2k,3dr196,joreclros92,11,Sat Jul 18 23:23:43 2015 UTC,Demar Derozen scored 67 points against me in a double overtime MyCareer game. There was no stopping him from mid range.

He almost never made them either. Since I've became the best player on the team it's been easier, but before that when I was still in the 70-80 range, it was a nightmare. I got no respect from Vasquez."

NBA2k,3dr196,Dabawse26,6,Sat Jul 18 19:44:21 2015 UTC,Ryan Anderson in 2K13 was by far the worst. He never passed the ball and always missed the shot.

Can't do a layup. Can't dunk. Sometimes won't pass the ball. Averaged really low points and FG%.  Especially when roasting him on social media, he just fires about on me although he deserves it.  And fun fact: when we won the Finals, my player celebrated with him. Wtf"

NBA2k,3dr196,jlu10,5,Sat Jul 18 22:23:23 2015 UTC,"Lebron has consistently been the most disappointing superstar match up when I play against him in career or GM. I don't think he has scored more than 18 against me/my team. I don't understand. Won't shoot, won't drive, won't set up shots for others. I swear he averages, against me, 11pts, 3ast, 3reb. Underwhelming. I look forward to beating him every time, but his lack of effort takes away from my fun.   Durant, though. Won't miss. Contested? Swish. Step back J with four defenders? Swish.

Bogut never wins tip offs and hardly plays. Goran and Delly (curry left) know their job: pass me the ball. Except Klay. Fuck him. He never passes, on a fast break when I have a wide open lane for a dunk or oop he'd rather dribble into two defenders and jack up a shot.

They all have the same playstyle on offense. Camp on the block, catch the ball, get backed out of the post, turnaround jumper that hits the side of the backboard. It's so frustrating.   I hate all of my teammates when we have a last possession of the quarter, especially at the end of a game. If we have the ball down 3 with <5 seconds left in the game, you can bet they'll inbound it to the center when he's 20 feet away from the basket and he'll airball it, or someone will catch and shoot immediately from 35 feet out even when there's time on the clock.

NBA2k,3dqkgh,MrFunk,6,Sat Jul 18 15:21:33 2015 UTC,"I got a couple of more suggestions for accessories and customizing your player:   Fix the glitch where you sometimes get your player's home accessories while playing an away game. Nothing worse than seeing your guy wear white arm and leg sleeves and make you stick out. More colors. Why do only certain accessories have colors beyond black, white, red and blue? And with those special accessories, they don't even have all the colors for every team! You might have a certain color, but it might not match the team's version of that color. If they don't want to add those colors, just make a ""team color 1"" and ""team color 2"" option.  Give us all the accessories in the game.  I have no explanation for why they did this, but certain accessories are omitted. There's a lot more when you create or edit a player, so why isn't in MyCareer? I'm a fan of the 3/4ths knee sleeves, but those aren't in the game mode.  More haircuts. They don't even have to do a lot of work here. Just let us pick from the haircuts already in the game for certain NBA players.  More and better tattoos. Again, would it really be that hard to let us copy the tattoos from other players?"
NBA2k,3dqkgh,strifeblood,3,Sat Jul 18 21:51:10 2015 UTC,"I hate the tattoos. If I'm going to give my player a tattoo, it's not going to be a Chinese letter or a fucking wolf howling at the moon. I want tattoo sleeves."

Even though they aren't pro, many are still really talented (a large number of teams have taken international trips to play national teams) and NCAA basketball is arguably more physical than the NBA. Furthermore, many of these teams are located in smaller cities far from pro teams, (example: I live in Iowa City, where the nearest pro team is about 400km away) so it's nice to be able pro-level players without driving 4 hours. Finally, and perhaps most importantly, there's a pretty level playing field for recruiting in the top 5 NCAA conferences, so, often, players will choose your team (and school) because they love the area, what the school stands for, and the fanbase, which resonates deeply with those who enjoy basketball in that area."

NBA2k,3dokuh,Mr-BigShot,2,Sat Jul 18 06:17:28 2015 UTC,I mean the 95 rated MJ is still in my lineup and I would assume it would be rated similarly to that one since it is the same year if not higher since it is a moments card which probably means it is going to be the 63 point game against the Celtics or the Dunk Contest version  But giving such a good card is kinda unfair so they may lower it to like a 88 or something but it doesn't make sense because they suck MJ's dick so hard

NBA2k,3dnpx8,Shadowgale,2,Sat Jul 18 10:16:55 2015 UTC,"Your statement about it happening in higher difficulties is exactly it. If you're not playing at quality good enough for the difficulty level then you'll see more and more of these ""comebacks"".  What most people don't seem to understand is that the game cheeses for YOU in a lot of those instances putting you in the lead if you're outmatched by the AI. That's when the comeback kicks in.  This happens a lot in h2h. Sometimes scrubby players will hold the lead for a portion of the game but if you're a sound 2k player you'll get your late comeback."
NBA2k,3dnpx8,thehottip,2,Sat Jul 18 05:53:23 2015 UTC,"Not to mention most people feed the drought. If I miss a few shots I feel should've gone in, then I call a timeout, slow down the pace and play my game. Often times I get caught up in the pace of the ""cheesers"" and it causes me to run when its not my game plan at the moment, and put up quick shots. Just like how people would complain that great shooters would start missing. I could fix it 99% of the time by calling time, switching my POE to get shooters open and shoot at will, or avg. depending on my current pace and shots would start falling again. People will miss 5 3s in a row and complain that its not going in though they just keep with the same strategy. Basically 2K players complain too much. There is a lot of bs in the game but that goes for everyone and a lot of it has to do with peoples inability to adjust."
NBA2k,3dnpx8,Rancho2Valley,1 point,Sat Jul 18 06:25:53 2015 UTC,Exactly. There's more than enough people that agree with me that play this game on higher difficulties.

For 4th Quarter or 2nd Half comebacks, your first thought of Closer could account for a lot, and also Alpha Dog and Heart and Soul.

NBA2k,3dnpx8,Hotwyre,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:56:42 2015 UTC,"All i need to know about 4th quarter comeback cheese is that I have seen faaaaaaaar too many random scrub centers/power forwards nail contested fade away threes in the 4th. Played a game in mycareer a few days ago, the game was too far out of reach for the other team to win, and I had saw the most infuriating bullshit cheese combo. The point guard gets past his defender, but I meet him at the rim for a block, with about 3 seconds left on the shot clock.  The ball goes right past one of my teammates who is apparently too busy to actually grab the damn thing ... (bullshit #1). The bench warmer he is supposed to be guarding, PF or C but don't remember at this point, gets the rebound while springting from the lane to the baseline/corner three position.  At this point there is only about a second and a half on the shot clock, but it doesn't matter because this guy, empowered by the god of cheese, does a run-grab-turnaround-fading corner three and hits it without even touching rim(bullshit #2)... This guy has 25 moving and standing three, with no tendency to shoot either type of three... if that would have cost me a game in some other situation I might have uninstalled,  but now all i can consider it is fucking stupid."

Definitely see outlandish shots from unlikely players at high difficulties, but now that I've been going back and cleaning up low-level Challenges in MyTeam, which I presume are set at Pro, it's easy to run up and maintain a big lead (i.e. 15-25 points) and win pulling away in the last minutes of the 4th quarter.  But the really hard, high-MT-reward challenges often seem to have the CPU coming back with the vengeance in the 4th."

NBA2k,3dnvhn,JayTheLoser,3,Fri Jul 17 20:13:07 2015 UTC,"I suppose when you say 'input lag' you're referring to online? Locally, everything runs smoothly. Occasionally online, everything will be decent as well. However, a majority of my time spent in MyPark is pretty goddamn laggy, and makes it nearly impossible to play defense effectively. Especially when some people just run back and forth along the 3 pt line hoping that you'll lag behind so they can get up an 'open'  3.   Also, 3pt shooting is waaaaayyy too overpowered in Mypark. In the NBA, a good 3pt% is around 35-39%,and 40% is fairly exceptional. Plenty of dudes shoot upwards of 80% from 3 in mypark, and it makes it worse when it's from sooo far behind the 3pt line.. Just so overpowered..   Also, let me play 6 minute quarters in myplayer AND make the cpu sim games at 6 minutes as well.. Why do I have the option to play different lengths of quarters, but the cpu sims at 12 minutes??! This was probably the most glaring omission I've seen in a sports game..   Basically, fix all the lag and matchmaking issues with myPark and I'd happily shovel another $60 towards 2k this year. I actually love myGm (or myleague, whatever it is now) so I'd definitely play a refreshed version of that with some more franchise /cap features."
NBA2k,3dnvhn,daavoo,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:32:58 2015 UTC,"When OP -- and anyone else -- refers to lag, they're referring to online play.    Totally agree with you on the issue of quarter lengths in MyPlayer needing to match, when it comes to what one plays and what is simmed.  People have quarter lengths they think lead to realistic numbers, for what it's worth.  But then one has to play longer than 6 minute quarters (think most people say 8 or 10 is most ""realistic"") and ain't nobody got time for that.  Like many problems with the game, it's such an easy and obvious fix that 2K just looks stupid for allowing it to have been an issue, much less not fixing it.  On three-pointers: they're apparently OP by most everyone's account. People can bomb with impunity in MyPark and in MyTeam.  I, myself, just don't seem to have good timing and/or don't understand how to achieve the minimal distance necessary to have an uncontested shot, because I generally end up shooting realistic percentages: ~33% if I'm cheese-bombing and taking bad shots, ~40% if I'm taking more than realistic but being selective, and ~50% or more if I'm shooting a realistic average number because I'm being highly selective.  If 3 pointers were nerfed, I'd probably be fucked, but it seems that something needs to happen to diminish mad bombing, for the good of the game."
NBA2k,3dnvhn,HarryLundt,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:21:10 2015 UTC,"Fixing the lag will definitely fix a ton of other things, and allowing us to play good defense is one of those things."
NBA2k,3dnvhn,iidesune,2,Fri Jul 17 22:46:25 2015 UTC,"In regards to AI, I get frustrated when players don't fill the lanes properly on fast breaks. For example, when Wall is coming down center court on the break, and Otto Porter is running towards the corner or the wing for the three-point shot instead of going to the basket. Porter is not a three point shooter, and should be cutting to the basket. A lot of players run straight for the three-point line instead of cutting to the basket on the fast break. It's frustrating."
NBA2k,3dnvhn,HarryLundt,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:26:15 2015 UTC,"Yeah. Instead of focusing on player specific celebrations and animations, maybe they should look more at player types and specialties. Every player should have a role on the fast break and you should be able to plan that fast break on the fly based on those roles. It seems kinda random now."
NBA2k,3dnvhn,WatchMeDrive,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:44:23 2015 UTC,"This is a pain in the fucking ass.  That said, I think the best way to get your teammate to streak to the basket on the fast break is to make sure to favor the opposite side of the key.  They're more likely to fill the other lane to close at the rim.    I'm not sure but I think, if one goes more or less straight up the middle on a fast break, one's teammates are more likely to go to the corner.  They're trying to create spacing and by going up the middle, one is sort of clogging up the paint.  I think that's the case..."
NBA2k,3dnvhn,HarryLundt,2,Fri Jul 17 22:49:51 2015 UTC,"when a player is open in the corner and decides to cut the very second I pass him the ball   This so much, it resulted in a lot of turnovers for me before I realized that this is something the AI does on a consistent basis. Also, when I pass to a good post-up big man who is mismatched with a MUCH shorter guard. What does he do? Pass it right back to me instead of posting up."
NBA2k,3dnvhn,HarryLundt,2,Fri Jul 17 22:41:58 2015 UTC,"Good post and all good points.    The expense of packs and the relatively low rewards for playing games and completing Challenges is annoying but they won't fix that because VC sales are a cash cow.  Don't know what a 7500 coin pack is like for Madden or how long games take, but one can definitely buy the cheapest NBA2K pack after playing two games of MyCareer, once one is on a good contract and playing on a higher difficulty level.    I think one can also buy the cheapest pack in MT by grinding it out with a Silver/Bronze team (i.e. after accounting for Contracts cost).  Even with Gold/Gem cards if one is playing a 12-min quarter Challenge.    In the end, I'd like to be able to get more packs with less time grinding, but the system still allows for building up a nice collection without paying any money.  More so than spending time grinding games for MT/VC, the real key is Auction House trading for MT profit.    Without spending a dime of real money beyond the cost of the game, I've assembled a collection that's pretty strong, albeit not as good as those who are really good/have invested a shit-ton of time:   PG: PD Curry, Gold Big O, Onyx Kidd, Onyx Hardaway, buncha 2015 Golds. SG: Onyx Richmond, Ruby Klay, Onyx Vince, Onyx Clyde, Onyx Ray Allen, buncha 2015 Golds, and Sapphire Nique. SF: Onyx Hondo, Onyx Artest, Onyx Iggy, Gold Lebron, Gold PG13, Gold KD, other 2015 Golds, and Sapphire Mullin and Barry. PF: My weakest position, but...Shitty Ruby Garnett, Gold McHale, and all other top 2015 Golds. C: Ruby Mutombo, Ruby Mourning, Ruby Parish, Gold Russell, all good 2015 Golds, and Sapphire Yao.   And I have about 250K MT sitting around to buy other high-end players and/or complete Collections for good Sapphires.    Half of the above was possible only because I did buy a few Ruby packs months ago with VC from MyCareer and lucked out with a Ruby Payton I was able to sell for 650K MT recently.  But I had a respectable team before that, and around 70K of MT to play with.  BUT...this was all done ""playing"" the Auction House for probably about as much actual time as ""the game"" itself.  Which has been idiotic for me because I'm not a 16-year-old with a ton of free time."
NBA2k,3dnvhn,Gioray,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:44:34 2015 UTC,"they won't fix that because VC sales are a cash cow.   I have zero doubt in my mind that EA makes more on Madden than 2k makes. I can't explain it without writing another essay, but Ultimate Team is the perfect formula (or at least the best we have). No way is 2k15 making Madden money."
NBA2k,3dnvhn,Gioray,1 point,Fri Jul 17 23:15:10 2015 UTC,Won't argue with you in that I want the best game possible and I haven't played Madden for many years.  But I do recall seeing something about how NBA2K sells more units than Madden now.  I think.  Don't know jack about in-game transaction figures though.  The concept of some people spending hundreds of dollars on the game boggles my mind.  (Which is not to say that it's a waste of money.  I would have been better off in life if I had spent less of my time playing the AH and just buying VC and selling card pulls...or buying MT off the secondary market.)

NBA2k,3dnsoj,HarryLundt,4,Fri Jul 17 19:52:11 2015 UTC,"Turn the controller on before starting (or alt-tabbing into) NBA2K15. If that doesn't work, try using Steam's ""Big Picture"" mode."

So I don't think it has to do with that.  BUT...I've seen other tips regarding running in Big Picture Mode, which I take to be Fullscreen.  I'll give that a shot and see if that fixes the issue.  I've been playing NBA2K in ""windowed"" mode, graphically."
NBA2k,3dnsoj,BigMantrose,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:45:10 2015 UTC,Big picture mode has always worked for me
NBA2k,3dnsoj,BigMantrose,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:29:50 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the input.  I actually now have what might be a dumb question: Big Picture mode is the fullscreen mode for the Steam client.  But on a PC -- mine at least -- NBA2K runs in its own separate process/window.  Within NBA2K itself, I can select fullscreen display instead of windowed.    So isn't using Big Picture mode for the Steam client kind of irrelevant to how NBA2K runs?  Or is it relevant?  Or do you guys mean that I should run the NBA2K15 ""program""/game in Fullscreen mode, regardless of how the Steam client is running?  Sorry if this is a dumb question..."
NBA2k,3dnsoj,KonradKant,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:55:34 2015 UTC,"The reason for starting in big picture is so the controller will work with the game. Not sure if full screen matters or not, you just need to start through big picture mode with a controller"
NBA2k,3dnsoj,KonradKant,1 point,Fri Jul 17 23:12:55 2015 UTC,"I'll give it a shot in all possible permutations, but my controller works fine with the game without the game being started from within Big Picture Mode.  I can flop back and forth between NBA2K and any other program on my computer.  It only has this weird glitch when playing RttP, so it must be something to do with playing a mode that has a constant connection to the servers, not just periodic communication.  (MyPark would be a good additional test, but I never see anyone in MyPark.)"
NBA2k,3dnsoj,KonradKant,2,Fri Jul 17 23:34:38 2015 UTC,"It works for me as long as it's plugged-in and connected without interruption before I start the game.

NBA2k,3dnsoj,KonradKant,1 point,Fri Jul 17 23:44:23 2015 UTC,"So there were times, when you were using wireless, that the batteries zonked out and, after replacing, controller no longer worked?  Maybe my problem is that I tend to keep it in windowed mode so that I can do something else on my computer while I wait a million years to get a match for my bullshit 8th Seed bracket."
NBA2k,3dnsoj,Saltydawgg,2,Fri Jul 17 23:52:17 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the controller needs to be up and running (light on) before you launch the game. Maybe going full-screen and using the Steam browser or listening to a basketball podcast helps."
NBA2k,3dnsoj,Saltydawgg,1 point,Sat Jul 18 00:22:25 2015 UTC,"I'm going to try to launch NBA2K15 from within the Steam client while the Steam client is in Big Picture Mode.  It ends up launch the game in whatever graphical mode is set in the game, but I'll try setting that to Fullscreen instead of Windowed.  But to be clear: I only have issues with the controller not working in RttP games, and not always.  I basically never have issues otherwise.  And that's whether I have my controller on/active before launching the game, or after I launch it."

NBA2k,3dk78d,tupacsrbija,20,Thu Jul 16 22:54:43 2015 UTC,"I can vouch for the incompetence of the two guys who run this tournament.   When I first heard about the tournament I was very interested in taking part so I ended up signing up and landed the Suns.   The first sign of incompetence was when I sent my roster to BlkFrankWhite to review. I had Onyx Danny Granger on the roster, who at that time was on the current roster for the Suns. He told me that Granger wasn't allowed to be used on the team as he wasn't an 'all-time Suns player'. I explained to him that Granger was currently on the Suns roster and that the rules of the tournament permitted players who are currently on the roster.   At this point he probably was feeling stupid, but his next response only helped further prove this. He responds back to me with: ""It has to be as of last season brother""... I again had to explain to him that Granger was a member of the Suns roster last season as he was involved in the Dragic trade.  After that I was then told I couldn't use Shaq on the roster, which I understood. I thought he was significant enough of a player and especially to balance out fairness to be used for the Suns team to compete with all the super teams like LA, Boston etc. Later I was accused of only leaving the tournament because I couldn't use Shaq. When I called out BlkFrankWhite on it and told him my real reasoning behind it he says: ""tough guy talking behind twitter. go fuck yourself"". What an upstanding professional in charge of running a tournament involving money.   He's constantly berating people on twitter, and according to his twitter responses apparently ""excessive use of pick and roll is cheese"". I fail to understand how one of the basic elements of conducting an offense resembling real basketball is now considered cheese."
NBA2k,3dk78d,Flysenberg,2,Thu Jul 16 23:28:29 2015 UTC,I thought that the player had to be on the team for at least 3 years? Or thats what ive heard from other youtubers.
NBA2k,3dk78d,Evoncicles,3,Thu Jul 16 23:42:39 2015 UTC,That's for historic players whose in game cards are for different teams. Rules stated anyone on the current day roster can be used.
NBA2k,3dk78d,Flysenberg,2,Thu Jul 16 23:44:23 2015 UTC,ah ok
NBA2k,3dk78d,Evoncicles,2,Thu Jul 16 23:50:24 2015 UTC,"That was the rule, regardless of the level/team affiliation of the card?  So the guy with the Clippers could use 07-08 Onyx Paul Pierce, even though 14-15 Gold Paul Pierce would be indicative of the Pierce the Clippers will have on their team?  Sixers can use PD Iguodala instead of Onyx Iguodala?  Warriors can use Ruby Parish?  I guess it's necessary to give leeway to people because a lot of teams need some help matching up with some of the powerhouse franchises.  And I could see allowing a Warriors player to use a Lakers Wilt because not everyone can afford an Onyx Wilt.  Eh, anyway...far from the only set of rules and standards that seems kind of arbitrary in this shitshow..."
NBA2k,3dk78d,HarryLundt,2,Fri Jul 17 02:23:15 2015 UTC,"It was a tournament designed around all-time great players to build an all-time great team. With how limited some of the players are for some teams, its only fair that players get to use good versions of cards. The Clippers have never been as successful of a franchise as Boston and the Lakers have, so there needs to be something to make it fair otherwise its almost guaranteed that Boston and LA are going to be in the final game."
NBA2k,3dk78d,Flysenberg,12,Fri Jul 17 02:35:40 2015 UTC,"Thank you for posting this. I was playing with the Celtics in this tournament against a guy with the Magic. His name is AI_Cash_Out. Apparently this guy is friends with Frank the host, he was in party with him while he was streaming the game. We played our first game and he played a lot of iso with Penny Hardaway, so later in the game i double teamed him from time to time like a regular NBA team would do right?  After a lot of pause pressing he left the game at the 4th quarter while i was winning and messaged me with ""Hey bro no offball or double team Frank the Host said to restart, resend the invite"". Like wtf when i start winning he left the game. Then the Host Frank messaged me and told me ""Pow u guys must decide on on ball or off ball before the game starts, that didn't happen so u must restart the game"". Ok so how is it my fault that he didn't contact me before the game about on or offball agreements. Like when he starts losing we have to agree on that wtf.  Then they sended me the page of the rules http://challonge.com/kingsofkingsps4 which i never heard before because i thought http://2kmtcentral.com/kingsofkings was the page.  Frank said then that i have to reinvite or i will get kicked out of the tournament, so i agreed to play again and play on ball all the time. I've won again but later in his stream he said that i was cheesing again with off ball and pick & roll only.   I uploaded the game on youtube:  part 1: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8-lIpKDVyA part 2: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZmmzr-cZ_g  you can see that i played on ball defense all the time and didn't as much pick & roll as much as the guy was isoing with Penny.  After the game the hosts messaged me in twitter and said: ""Hey. So I was told that after being told the rules that u blatantly broke them by off balling and excessive pick and rolling"" I said that it is'nt true but they didn't believe me so i sended them the videos.  After watching the video they sended me: ""So. Upon reviewing the videos. It has been determined that the game will be awarded to The Answer AI3. Due to excessive cheesing""  TL;DR The hosts of the tournament kicked me out of the tournament because i was using too much pick & roll which is apparently excessive cheesing and my opponent, who lost twice against me and is friends with the hosts, advanced who almost only used iso plays with Penny which is apparently no cheese."
NBA2k,3dk78d,p0w,6,Fri Jul 17 00:42:01 2015 UTC,What the fuck is an on-ball or off-ball agreement? I switch between both regularly. If I'm on balling and I see a situation where my opponent is going to pass I off ball and try to get into that passing lane. The guys who run this tournament thinking that 'excessive screens' are cheese have clearly no knowledge of the game of basketball. Pretty much every play ever designed in the modern NBA has revolved around a screen being set somewhere. Fuck those guys.

I sent messages to all of them trying to set up a match as soon as the roster came out. Only two replied, one ended up forfeiting saying I could have the win because of personal reasons. The other added me as a friend on psn. I tried to message him to set up a match and he replied like 2 days before the prelims ended. So our schedules didn't end up meshing and we never played. I end up getting a message saying I'm out. When I watched the stream for the final selections I saw not just one, but TWO spurs teams in there, even though I technically was the only one that attempted to play the prelims.

NBA2k,3dia3s,thedanger1847,6,Thu Jul 16 16:13:15 2015 UTC,"Same for me, but I am a 7' 0"" 245lb center who gets moved to PF now that my team traded for another center. I was never a PF before though, so I think your rotation is needs based as well as your players versatility"
NBA2k,3dia3s,AthlonRob,7,Thu Jul 16 18:38:02 2015 UTC,"I have a 6'6"" PG and get subbed in at SG all the time. On my player card it also shows PG/SG as my position. I think as long as your sf is tall enough to play pf (6'9"" or taller just as an estimate) and gets subbed in at that position fairly regularly you'll get pf as a secondary position."
NBA2k,3dia3s,joreclros92,4,Thu Jul 16 17:52:56 2015 UTC,It might be a glitch but I made a 6'7 PG and one of the things I wanted to do was post up the smaller guards. I did it enough times I actually got subbed in at PF. It's my second character I play with when I'm tired of my SF. Don't play it often.
NBA2k,3dia3s,Lightning_Boi,3,Thu Jul 16 18:58:38 2015 UTC,"You have to play around with the height and weight. Like 6' 8"" with 240 lbs got example. I don't know if it would work."

NBA2k,3dia3s,AntHill12790,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:37:46 2015 UTC,I think it completely relies on the team you play with. I am a max height SG. I played on the lakers and because they have. well had. they got rid of him this season but anyways. i would always start SF and be moved to SG when kobe either went PG or bench.   I am on the Cavs now and I start SG but when Lebron goes to PF I take SF and they bring in dellevadova.
NBA2k,3dia3s,BrownGuyGaming,2,Thu Jul 16 22:31:21 2015 UTC,"The reason your My Player plays a different position is because one of the teams best players already plays that position. If you are a PG on the Clippers, you will be moved to SG because Chris Paul plays that position. Similarly, if you play PF for the Clippers, you will be likely moved to center, depending on height and weight, because Blake Griffen plays that position."
NBA2k,3dixj7,cwillis1605,7,Thu Jul 16 17:19:04 2015 UTC,"Nope. The best you can do is recreate his myPlayer in Create-a-Roster, put him on a team, load up the roster and from there play blacktop."

NBA2k,3djec0,redblade13,1 point,Fri Jul 17 12:07:54 2015 UTC,What I want fixed is the Deadeye badge system. Without Deadeye most players can't make 3s from corners if a defender is just walking near him not even contesting. For example in myPark I used to play without Deadeye. I missed open 3s and 2s and whenever someone walked near me my shot didnt go in. As soon as get it boom my PPG increase like 50 percent. Not only myPark but in myTeam or any other mode. Deadeye is a must for any player because apparently professional basketball players cant make a 3 or a 2 with a guy 2 feet away from him who isn't even trying to contest the shot. I mean the badge activates everywhere even by yourself it is automatic boost to a player shot.  Then there is the opposite where Deadeye is insanely OP to the point where you can make crazy 3s. But its not as bad as not having Deadeye.

NBA2k,3dgg30,HarryLundt,14,Thu Jul 16 02:00:41 2015 UTC,"I agree completely.  I think basing it on margin of victory makes the most sense.  I mean, the mode is called DOMINATION, after all.  If you win the game you get the one-star pack.  If you win by 10+ you get the next pack.  And if you win by 20+, truly dominating your opponent, you get the third pack.  Nice and simple."
NBA2k,3dgg30,malowry0124,8,Thu Jul 16 02:23:30 2015 UTC,"CALM DOWN!  (I'm trying to remember if I found it easy to win by 20 points in Domination...I think, often times yes...but due to rubberband effect, think I rarely ever beat the CPU by more than 15.  Then again...that was playing to maximize MT, not maximize point differential.)"
NBA2k,3dgg30,harpake,-17,Thu Jul 16 02:50:38 2015 UTC,There is no rubberband effect in NBA 2K15. I've played plenty of games with rubberband and enough 2K15 on HOF to know it simply doesn't exist in the game. A couple of years ago there used to be some momentum effects in the game but those have been removed as well.
NBA2k,3dgg30,emerica0250,12,Thu Jul 16 11:02:11 2015 UTC,That is so not true. At all.
NBA2k,3dgg30,harpake,-4,Thu Jul 16 12:03:22 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I think I'm going to take my experience of mopping the floor with the HOF AI for years and the dev's word over people who can't hold a lead and think there must be some external factors in play.  People complain about impossible shots, shot clock cheese and CPUs animations all the time but due to confirmation bias only really notice them when the points are significant. Yes, the AI doesn't play with the same rules as you do. But that doesn't change at all depending on what the score is."
NBA2k,3dgg30,BuickGrandNationalX,2,Thu Jul 16 12:48:18 2015 UTC,"Perhaps I'm just falling victim to momentum shifts and not calling timeouts as I should, or losing focus when up by a wide margin.  There are certain challenges that seem like CPU really turns it up in the 4th Quarter, but perhaps that's Closer badges at work like u/BuickGrandNationalX theorizes.  Any which way, I personally do not easily and consistently beat the CPU by 20+.  But, then...I'm not very good at this game."
NBA2k,3dgg30,BuickGrandNationalX,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:23:36 2015 UTC,I feel it too.  I'm just trying to come up with a rational explanation.
NBA2k,3dgg30,harpake,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:03:25 2015 UTC,"I guess your thought of Closer makes sense, as I think I can remember this most distinctly happening when playing Challenges with the CPU having an elite lineup.  Last minutes of the 4th Quarter, when up by, say, 10 points, the CPU suddenly becoming God-like, and shooting like 80-90% and, in final minute, clawing it's way back toward a tie by intentionally fouling and draining contested threes."
NBA2k,3dgg30,BuickGrandNationalX,0,Thu Jul 16 21:37:48 2015 UTC,Maybe it's the closer personality badge?  That's my theory.
NBA2k,3dgg30,KnightsOfBrohan,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:57:03 2015 UTC,Closer is definitely very powerful.
NBA2k,3dgg30,lukelear,2,Thu Jul 16 15:04:16 2015 UTC,It's usually just KD or curry drilling terrible threes in spite of good defense.
NBA2k,3dgg30,lukelear,2,Thu Jul 16 15:07:48 2015 UTC,This a perfect simple solution. No reason for this not to be implemented
NBA2k,3dgg30,Acegambit777,4,Thu Jul 16 17:11:59 2015 UTC,"I don't know, they hardly give us MT as it is so I'm perfectly fine with it"
NBA2k,3dgg30,NamesObvious,7,Thu Jul 16 02:13:38 2015 UTC,"Sorry, I realized my Title is misleading.  What I was writing about was how silly it is to base the awarding of Domination Reward Packs upon clearing certain thresholds of MT gained in that game.  Not complaining that MT is earned in the game, which of course I'll happily take."
NBA2k,3dgg30,redblade13,3,Thu Jul 16 02:35:52 2015 UTC,"I know what you mean. It doesn't really encourage playing REAL basketball. I'd be much happier if it was something similar to the teammate grade system instead of something that simply encourages run 'n' gun type basketball play with scoring as much as possible, passing as much as possible, getting post moves as much as possible, having as little possession time as possible, etc.  Though I will say that it is helpful for when there ARE situations where you need to play like that against an opponent and it's helpful in practicing to run the fast break and shit like that. It just doesn't feel like you get rewarded for actually playing basketball intelligently."
NBA2k,3dgg30,SmokyMcBalls,2,Thu Jul 16 02:38:05 2015 UTC,"I hear that. It was in figuring out how to game the Domination game that I worked a lot on post offense. Not just PFA, but all the other moves too. So in that roundabout way, it helped round out my skills and understanding of NBA2K controls.  But that's kind of accidental, of course.  After all, one thing that we're lacking but which would be very useful and welcome is some sort of scrimmage/training mode in MyTeam...for practicing shooting with a particular player and also for practicing particular play with particular lineups.  Boggles my mind that this is missing.  Instead, we have to burn Contracts in order to use/try a new player or to ""practice"" with our teams."

It's stupid that the ball can still go through a defenders arm and be made while you can dribble up the court, and the ball would tap your teammates ass and you just fucking lose it. His reply was under the lines of, it's not ready to be truly used or something like that."

Only player I bought was Dirk and filled up my lineup with players I had gotten from packs. Then after I completed domination, sell all players/jerseys/contracts/badges. Don't quicksell anything and you'll end up with around 70k in mt. Then do the sapphire collections of the players I have, and you'll make your money back buy selling the players you bought. After all that you'll have around 40k to play around with. If you get lucky and get around 90k you can also add sapphire wilt and sapphire olajuwon"

EDIT: Summer League will not be in MyCareer as was pointed out to me by /u/yyy2k  If the leaked achievement list from yesterday is in fact real and you get to play college ball, what I would think could happen is that you play in Pro Am leagues during your college period and then in the Summer League after the draft to earn your spot on the team.

NBA2k,3dfhe7,cleverley1986,3,Wed Jul 15 22:56:06 2015 UTC,I think its worth noting the change from 2k13 to 2k15 with regards to the draft. In 2k13 if you got drafted 1st it would reshuffled the other players so that all the rookies would be on different teams. Which sucks in my opinion. Then in 2k15 you go undrafted to prevent this issue. I dont think 2k will allow you to enter a draft that will reshuffle rookies again. In 2k15 your player blames his agent for not making the draft...this year it could be anything. Perhaps if your last college year is the 15/16 season and you draft into the 16/17 season that would be cool...but you may not be playing on teams with todays rosters...shit even players like tim duncan and kobe may be retired by then.

You play well enough to attract NBA interest and get signed to a Summer League team, which leads to you earning a one-year contract.

You can trade a 12th man 60 with your 2nd round pick for a lower 1st rounder. But it does get ridiculous sometimes...Always feel they neglect things like this in a great game mode.
NBA2k,3dewpb,tehace,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:01:25 2015 UTC,"Most likely those are instant replay files that are constantly being re-written as you play. Some games allow you to disable or relocate replay files but I don't think 2K15 gives you that option.  A possible fix you could do if those are indeed the replay files (haven't tried and can't be bothered) is to delete those files, then create new files with the same names and mark those as read-only so the game can't write info on them. This might make the game crash on startup or if you try to go to the replay menu depending on how they've coded the game so make a backup if you do try to delete them."

NBA2k,3davd7,wonderbreadftw,0,Wed Jul 15 08:19:20 2015 UTC,Melo is always really overrated. The only thing that matters in 2K is offense and when you get a really good offensive player like Melo he can carry a team to the playoffs.
NBA2k,3davd7,HarryLundt,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:49:45 2015 UTC,"I get that, but the rest of the Knicks lineup is sorely lacking.  It would be interesting to know if OP's simulation had Melo averaging, like, 40+ PPG, because that's the only way I see the Knicks making #7 seed, even in the East."
NBA2k,3davd7,B_eb21,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:01:32 2015 UTC,Knicks lineup isn't that lacking for a 7th seed in the east. Celtics got the 7th seed last year and their lineup isn't much better than Jerian Grant-Afflalo-Melo-Porzingis-Lopez
NBA2k,3davd7,HarryLundt,2,Wed Jul 15 21:58:49 2015 UTC,"Hm, that's a good point. I guess we'll see next year how the Knicks shake out.    Won't disregard addition of Afflalo, but it'll take a new season for them to shake my impression of them as ""Melo + D-Leaguers.""  Kind of hope they do.  It's a shame to see such a proud and storied franchise playing tanking games."
NBA2k,3davd7,B_eb21,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:30:47 2015 UTC,"Well at least we won't be purposefully tanking next year since we have no draft pick haha. But I think Robin Lopez and Afflalo will be the two most competent, serious Nba players to play with Melo in a long time, and I think that Jerian and Porzingis will be really good rookies. I could see the Knicks missing the playoffs, but I also think we might even do better than the 7th seed, it's just such a tossup right now. This time last year nobody thought the Celts or Bucks would make the playoffs, and nobody thought the hawks would be as good as they are, so who knows right?"
NBA2k,3davd7,HarryLundt,2,Wed Jul 15 22:34:12 2015 UTC,"True that, insofar as tanking goes. They need to show something this year, though mad props to NYC fans being so loyal that people go to MSG to watch even last year's garbage team.  Phil is high on Jerian and the hype machine seems to be pumping up Porzingis now that he's a Knick.  Will be really interesting to see how Porzingis develops, in particular.  So maybe, if all other things remain equal, Knicks can take the Nets playoff spot.  Lord knows they didn't deserve it.  One thing that was a welcome surprise in picking up NBA2K again with NBA2K15, was seeing all the historic players.  I hadn't played the series for almost a decade.  While I'm a Warriors fan, I have had a soft spot for the Knicks since the Ewing days, which was reinforced when half the Knicks became Warriors with the Sprewell trade.  Currently thinking I should just maximize my enjoyment of this game for these last couple of months before 2K16.  Part of that would be finally picking up an Ewing.  Can't afford the Erasers, but Gold is no problem.  Then maybe bite the bullet and accept the bullshit rarity premium on Starks and Oakley on the PC Auction House..."

There was cheese where you could run baseline and get an easy lay-up, but that only worked for me in single player and myplayer. The newer 2k's have felt aggravating when playing against someone who abuses its faults. 2k12 almost every 3 pointer went in and mid rangers weren't even an option. 2k13 wasn't that bad in my opinion and could be up there with 2k10 as I did enjoy this game too, however dunking was automatic on this game. 2k14 didn't feel finished and was just 2k13 with updated rosters nothing new.

NBA2k,3da5h8,baliwala,5,Tue Jul 14 20:42:39 2015 UTC,"Yeah, same here. Domination was the only mode of MyTeam I played in 2K15, so to have more of that is something I'm looking forward to.   I'm also happy because it's another way to get historic player cards - although it means a lot of matches against the Bulls, Lakers and Celtics. I really hope we see some more classic teams than the ones that have been announced, and they can get players who have dropped out back in to the game (eg. KAJ etc.)  Interesting that you have to unlock it though - maybe after you complete normal Domination?  EDIT: On second thoughts, based on the wording of the achievement, I think historic Domination will be against each teams All Time side (e.g. the historic Domination Celtics will have Russell and Bird on the same team; Magic, Kobe and Jerry West on the Lakers etc.)  The achievement (if true) talks about getting 198 stars in both domination modes. We get 99 stars from the normal domination mode, if you double that (plus throw in a couple of all time NBA teams or something) you get to 198. Plus, the talk of unlocking the historic mode leads me to believe it will be a harder challenge than normal domination. If we unlock the mode at the end of domination, our teams would crush a lot of the lower historic teams (and our teams would keep getting stronger even against the best teams by end game)  I guess the issue comes with teams like OKC (do they get Kemp, Payton etc.?) and the Hornets, but I hope that isn't an issue.  I could be completely wrong, but I hope it's All Time teams in historic domination."

NBA2k,3da5h8,SKCham,4,Tue Jul 14 21:31:14 2015 UTC,"I think Vic will be a friend that the main character (Your Player) will have a toxic relationship with. They will bring out the worst characteristics in you and there will probably be a few moments that you're told to cut them off, but none will come with a real choice since there are so many achievements riding on your relationship.   The heavy presence of this character in the achievements leads me to believe that, one: Vic is voiced by Spike Lee, since he is so central to the story; two: 2K leaked these on purpose to raise sales; and three: this story is going to be great. I'll admit, I wasn't exactly excited when Spike Lee was mentioned since I've never really been interested in his movies, but this character's presence intrigues me. Vic seems like the type of character that starts as a high risk, high reward issue, but can become a great investment depending on how you choose/play. Some of these characters will represent real emotions and ideas and your choices will have even more effect on your player's personality and playing style.  No matter what happens, I'm more excited than I was when they announced the mode as an RPG. I think It'll be more of a ""Choose Your Own Adventure"" centered around basketball."

I'm against pre ordering as much as the next person, however, I trust 2K is gonna go all out on this PC version, as we've already seen good improvements from last year such as adding the summer league, 50 track in the soundtrack, and body scans. So if that is a sign of whats to come, then that definitely makes me pre order 2K.  Besides I need to get that preload since the game will probably be larger then 2K15."
NBA2k,3datci,JohnConquest,0,Wed Jul 15 03:21:48 2015 UTC,"Ehh body scans and just adding a few more tracks isnt much.   2k will need to come out and say they have fixed the server lag, have actual support (instead of tweeting some clown on twitter...) and actually has done something to fix the stupid cheese that ruins online games.  Those 3 things are what are actually needed to make 2k16 better then 2k15. not adding a couple extra songs...  But yeah, i suppose go pre order for summer league!!!"
NBA2k,3datci,IMNOTMATT,2,Wed Jul 15 03:46:08 2015 UTC,"Body scans definitely make the game look better, I don't care about online at all since I never play MyTeam or Park at all, however cheese is a problem, but you know 2K wont get rid of that.

But I haven't gotten the 35k for 2k15 yet.  It gave me a product code, but the game doesn't ask for it.  (Fucking 2k.).  Anyone else pre-order?"
NBA2k,3datci,gibbons_iyf,3,Wed Jul 15 17:09:03 2015 UTC,I think the code might be used as a locker code so try entering it where you enter the locker codes. That's the way it was for the 2k15 pre-order code
NBA2k,3datci,gibbons_iyf,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:12:01 2015 UTC,That did it.
NBA2k,3datci,HarryLundt,2,Wed Jul 15 21:31:07 2015 UTC,"Like u/-Lemur says, try plugging in the code into Locker Codes.  I feel the same way about pre-ordering...I know I'm going to play the shit out of it, and $60 or whatever is basically irrelevant when compared to the many hours of my life that I waste on the game.  The only question is if it would be better to play 2K16 on console instead of PC, due to the higher population of online players on console platforms..."
NBA2k,3datci,dFluxx,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:58:44 2015 UTC,If they can somewhat convince me that their service (not the product) is going to take a step up then I'm ultimately gonna buy it. I'm used to the 2K product taking relatively good steps forward in terms of gameplay when compared with other sports games.
NBA2k,3datci,Retrokicker13,0,Wed Jul 15 17:25:29 2015 UTC,Modded 2k14 til the day I die... $70 for a standard version of this game?  Get the fuck out of here 2k.
NBA2k,3datci,HarryLundt,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:36:37 2015 UTC,"So are you mainly playing 2K14 with custom rosters and such?  Playing v. CPU, offline, obviously?  Franchise/season simulation used to be something that was the core of my gameplay with stuff like NBA2K, Madden, etc., but MyTeam has definitely been the mode in 2K15 that I've enjoyed the most.    Think I don't really have the sustained attention span necessary to play a succession of NBA seasons.  It's not like doing the same in Madden/NFL games, with much shorter seasons.  And front office franchise simulation play (MyGM) just seems like tedious homework to me.  What are you playing in 2K14 still?"
NBA2k,3datci,stuffedcrustorz,-3,Wed Jul 15 20:57:04 2015 UTC,I wouldn't buy this game on PC 2k15 was trash on pc with server issues and random crashes.

NBA2k,3datci,HarryLundt,1 point,Wed Jul 15 06:54:54 2015 UTC,"Things seemed to stabilize on PC Auction House.  When I see prices on 2KMTCentral, for consoles, they often seem high to me.  I think the big exception would be rare historic Bronze/Silver are too rare on PC and are sold at ridiculous premiums.  But all the players one would actually want to play with all seem to be about comparably priced, or even cheaper...for some months now.  Edit: But you make a good point regarding MyPark and MyTeam online play.  I have yet to ever see anyone in MyPark, ever, and can't get games in MyTeam.  But, with the latter, a lot of that probably has to do with starting the game/MyTeam/RttP relatively late and trying to get 8th Seed games when most of the (small) population is already in 5th Seed and above.  Anyway, giving me food for thought.  I don't have a XBOne or PS4 but don't really mind the expense of one to play even one game.  So I'm going to hold off on PC pre-order and chew on this..."
NBA2k,3datci,BoogerSlug,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:49:48 2015 UTC,"PC prices are much more for a lot of the great cards. For example. Onyx T-Mac is 400,000 on consoles and 600,000 on PC. Onyx Kobe is 200,000 on consoles but 700,000 on PC. This trend continues with a lot of other cards. Onyx Lebron 300,000 on consoles, 600,000 on PC."
NBA2k,3datci,HarryLundt,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:44:52 2015 UTC,"Ah, okay, sorry...most MT I've ever had was around 600K, so I'm pretty ignorant of cards in that price range.  And I only got that amount recently with sale of a luckily-drawn Ruby Payton, and have mostly been looking at cards < 150K.  And I have mostly been paying attention to the ""cheap"" end of the market, where desirable but freely available Golds/Rubies/Onyxes seem to be in same ballpark.    But I guess it's a case of the very rare being even rarer (and more expensive) on PC."
NBA2k,3dbol8,dwnz1,3,Wed Jul 15 00:50:28 2015 UTC,"That's the way I bought 2k15 and it's tied to the account you bought it from.

NBA2k,3dausv,LongLiveEddieHouse,1 point,Thu Jul 16 06:25:53 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the info, I did not put free agents in the free agent pool in case they resigned with the team so that they could maintain bird rights in association. Most of these guys I didn't worry to much about because they were not big names. A good amount I updated the day I saw your post. I'm making the corrections you put today. The rookies I took from the most realistic options available in the draft class uploads. Towns actually is complicated because I have gone up and down with his rating on my personal roster."
NBA2k,3dausv,Professor2k,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:39:07 2015 UTC,Ok so I just finished updating the roster next update is going to be adding rookies 15-30. I don't worry to much about the ratings to much most top prospects are anywhere from 78-82. AD was a 81 coming in. Okafor is a 79 as a center and when switched to pf he became a 81 (he is as polished offensively as AD was defensively). Towns is a little more complicated his skills as an overall basketball player are better then okafor so that's why he's a 80. You can not compare big men and guards ratings they have very different things influence the rating. Alot of pgs ratings jump when you move them to a 2 guard. Wiggins is a freak athlete but not great on the defensive end lowering his overall rating. I would say that okafor is better then Wiggins offensively at this time. So thats my justification for anow 80 KAC. However it is really hard to make these guys attribute and tendency wise so I just do my best. Porzingis and grant for example got a boost after watching them preform in the summer league bc they were much better then I expected. I also made pretty much every adjustment you listed except like 3 guys bc I could not find them or their rating was lower then the rest and their were 15 on the roster already. I also did not drop guys into the free agency bc I not only don't want to drop them then get signed by the same team and then loose Bird rights in association as well as I don't know what team they are on and really don't care to look bc I will never play with them anyway.

Unfortunately, almost never up on PC AH and, when they are, they're like 5K+, which seems ludicrous, but I guess is the going rate.  Since he has a ton of badges to start with and isn't going to be a 3-point shooter of choice (e.g. wasteful to add Limitless Range and/or Corner Specialist), the only two other Badges I was contemplating instead of Perimeter Lockdown were either Microwave or Deadeye, and former makes more sense to me than the latter."
NBA2k,3dafe4,BuickGrandNationalX,1 point,Tue Jul 14 21:53:27 2015 UTC,"Deadeye is key.  Limitless is pretty good, I have it on oscar, though something like bruiser, eraser or even lob city passer would be nice.  You could also go with Post spin technician or dream-like up and under."

Lob City Passer is something I generally think of as a no-brainer as lobs are probably something I'll do more than any single post move or any single type of layup.  And because Big O has a really nice PFA rating and is oversized for a PG, I thought Fade Ace was a must-apply for him.  Don't think I'd ever add Limitless, as I'd generally avoid taking threes with him, but Deadeye would be nice for contested midrange shots. Too bad, like Perimeter Lockdown Defender, it goes for such a heavy premium.  Will try playing more with him in the post and see if Post Spin and Dream-Like make sense for him/me...."
NBA2k,3dafe4,BuickGrandNationalX,1 point,Wed Jul 15 02:50:47 2015 UTC,"Deadeye makes him a better jump shooter from three or two.  If you weren't on PC, it would be worth it.  Best badge in the game, though not a good value.  Bruiser is really nice too.  Limitless is perfect for pull-ups.  It really works when you want to make the defense pay for sagging off.  Combined with deadeye and microwave, once he's rolling you can really surprise people with a long three."

Or you turned trades off and physically traded him in the season or association roster and when he got to your team you chose the reserve option instead of the starter option. Quick fix turn trade logic off assign him to the 76ers then assign him back on your team and set him as a starter. Then turn trade logic on exit the mode then go back in.

High pick and fades open up the middle, calling for a pick on the person that they are controlling forcing them to play help and then having your man slip the screen and all that help.

NBA2k,3d6a10,lukelear,4,Tue Jul 14 00:34:04 2015 UTC,"Glad you took up my advice on Gobert and Dragic is a good choice as your 2 guard. I also HIGHLY suggest having Troy Daniels as your backup shooting guard. There's a reason he used to be my favorite shooter in the game - for whatever reason, his 3 point jumper is INSANE and he heats up very quickly and easily Amazing shooter to have on your bench if you can pick him up cheap."
NBA2k,3d6a10,mrdrbot3000,3,Tue Jul 14 00:49:00 2015 UTC,I don't play online so i guess it is not a big deal but I want to make sure I'm not cheesing on single player. I am constantly running plays and 80% of the time the defense collapses on the lane and opens up the 3 point. So I take a the open shot which means I average quite a lot of 3's. Post shots are drastically more difficult to make than kicking out to an open shooter. So is that cheese? If i played against you and took open shots would you be upset?
NBA2k,3d6a10,mrdrbot3000,7,Tue Jul 14 02:10:02 2015 UTC,"Cheesing is really only in online.  If you're playing the computer and shooting a ton of threes it's not really ""cheesing.""  I played a domination game where steph curry had 80 points, 60 of them from threes"

NBA2k,3d6a10,sharke93,2,Tue Jul 14 03:29:56 2015 UTC,"Depending on his team, you can always just double team a zig zager like that with your PF while you control your C and force it out of the 3 pointer shooters hand to most likely his PF hanging out on the wing."
NBA2k,3d6a10,BoogerSlug,1 point,Mon Jul 13 22:42:12 2015 UTC,That's what I did.  I usered my center and covered the other side of the way he was zig zagging.  He still made them though idk how
NBA2k,3d6a10,TehGray,1 point,Tue Jul 14 00:28:10 2015 UTC,"For zig zag cheesers, change your defence to half court press, it makes all your defenders stand closer to the 3pt line instead of giving them heaps of room, then just set the defense on each of his 3pt shooters to tight and he wont be making a 3pt shot the cheesy way."
NBA2k,3d6a10,HarryLundt,1 point,Tue Jul 14 03:54:20 2015 UTC,You double with left bumper and then hitting the player you want to double with right?
NBA2k,3d6a10,Flysenberg,1 point,Tue Jul 14 00:31:15 2015 UTC,"To double I press L1 and then select which of my players I want to double him with, in most cases its the Y button which means my PF."

NBA2k,3d6a10,HarryLundt,1 point,Tue Jul 14 02:06:25 2015 UTC,"In a way, I have to grudgingly respect the 3-point cheesers.  I can't shoot anything like 12-17 from 3, even when all the shots are totally uncontested, with the man wide open due to a set play.  If I try to zig-zag cheese, I end up shooting around 30%.  So as cheesy at is, from my perspective, it still takes a lot of timing skill to create 3-point shots off the dribble."
NBA2k,3d6a10,zebearjew2,6,Mon Jul 13 23:20:08 2015 UTC,It kinda takes no skill at all. Run back and forth until you hit that animation where the defender stumbles over and then pull a three while he's trying to get up. I could do that blindfolded and shoot over 50% from outside. Its cheese and a shitty way to play plain and simple.
NBA2k,3d6a10,HarryLundt,1 point,Tue Jul 14 00:15:10 2015 UTC,"Ah! I had no idea that it was about crossing up a defender.  I thought it was just about getting just enough separation that the shot would be characterized as uncontested because the defender was closing in, but not quite quickly enough to technically contest."

NBA2k,3d67ie,prete26,4,Mon Jul 13 22:47:05 2015 UTC,"this is so true,  the game is incentivized so heavily towards taking all 2s.  if you shoot 50% taking all 2s its just as good as 100% all 1s. the better strategy is to take all 2s which is what people do and its unfortunate"
NBA2k,3d67ie,abunchofgingers,3,Mon Jul 13 23:08:31 2015 UTC,"Exactly, you have to shoot 66% from 1 in order to cancel out an average 33% from 2."
NBA2k,3d67ie,wonderbreadftw,9,Mon Jul 13 23:22:49 2015 UTC,"Well they need to change the movement physics. No human being can run full speed while dribbling back and forth in a perfectly straight horizantal line, then instantly put up a 3 pointer with pinpoint accuracy after stopping on a dime.  Maybe Steph Curry but even that is stretch."
NBA2k,3d67ie,JeweliusCaesar,4,Tue Jul 14 01:16:49 2015 UTC,That's not even the main problem imo. Nobody is able to zig zag offline because of good reaction time. There has to be little to zero input lag to stop zig zagging which unfortunately isn't happening on 2K's servers. The physics does play a part I think tho.
NBA2k,3d67ie,sharke93,3,Tue Jul 14 04:20:33 2015 UTC,"2s-3s, make the court bigger/longer & make the game total higher than 15."
NBA2k,3d67ie,lights6969,3,Tue Jul 14 01:04:26 2015 UTC,"Good suggestions in this thread but there should be stat level caps depending on height and position. Let's say I max my defense out on my 6'4"" PG. His block stat will still not raise above a 45 but a center with the same stack would probably be a 95. It's penalized when it comes to shorter players but 2K doesn't do it for taller players in the speed/shooting category. If you have a 7'0"" player, he should AUTOMATICALLY have a stat cap on shooting and/or speed. Take Dirk Nowitzki. Great shooter, slow as sh*t. Or Hakeem Olajuwon. Great speed but not a threat from behind the arc. There has to be balance in 2K16 and I think that will slow down the 2 point shootouts."

NBA2k,3d3nlc,Bieberkinz,1 point,Mon Jul 13 19:36:25 2015 UTC,thx i like the euroteams too but they were really outdated all year even after that last update. i really like creating the d league teams and was about to do summer league but oh well thx for the insight was hoping for a workaround.
NBA2k,3d411o,CookiezFort,3,Mon Jul 13 10:13:49 2015 UTC,Another thing: a good way to practice man-on-man defense is to play 1-on-1 Blacktop games. No passing/picks/etc...
NBA2k,3d411o,HarryLundt,3,Mon Jul 13 18:08:35 2015 UTC,It's normal. 2K's grading system is for being a good team mate not a scoring machine. It's almost an attempt to thwart people from being ball hogs. That's because....you know....basketball is not all about scoring lol. The best players in history were also notoriously good defenders (i.e. Jordan). It's not NBA JAM. You can't drive to the hoop and dunk everytime or shoot lights out until you figure the game out. Drop the difficulty though as you're learning the curves then up it when you start blowing teams out easily.
NBA2k,3d411o,EastPointVet,2,Mon Jul 13 18:11:39 2015 UTC,You can't drive to the hoop and dunk everytime or shoot lights out   Unless it's MyTeam of course :)
NBA2k,3d411o,Gioray,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:04:44 2015 UTC,Haha! I stand corrected!
NBA2k,3d411o,EastPointVet,1 point,Mon Jul 13 21:20:11 2015 UTC,"Other tips: Lay off the triggers on defense for the most part. Use extreme defense just to contest and turbo only to catch up if you were beaten or to contest a shot if you need to sprint to the shooter. Also...STAY WITH YOUR MAN....if you try to be a hero on defense and defend everyone with the ball, the computer will destroy you for it."
NBA2k,3d411o,EastPointVet,2,Mon Jul 13 18:13:50 2015 UTC,My hardest thing on defense is NOT using the triggers. I've noticed if you use the RT/R3 when closing out on your man you will run right by him. If you don't use sprint and just fast run the game will almost lock on to your man.  I only use LT/L3 if I'm in post defense. If I'm getting backed down in the post or the high key holding LT/L3 will help. But on the perimeter/mid range its makes your player move to slow to catch your man blowing by you.   TL:DR- don't use the triggers unless backed down in the paint or if you need to catch up to your man who's already past you.
NBA2k,3d411o,Acertop95,1 point,Mon Jul 13 12:33:40 2015 UTC,"Haha this is fine, this is how it is at the very beginning. You can just go through the earlier post of people freaking out saying that this game sucks and they cant score. Some tips ive learned for defending is just stay infront of your oppenent i used to have the tendency of trying to do too much such as defending and try to crash into the paint as a SG. Slightly move when defending like dont just move left but like slightly move left. As for the scoring change your jumpshot to something that has a good range, go to nba animations and scroll down and youll see during the preview of the jumpshot the blue bar at the bottom get one that has the biggest blue bar that will help alot. If you want i can upload some gameplay footage of mine to show you how i defend and score it might be helpful."
NBA2k,3d411o,Dannyzavage,1 point,Mon Jul 13 12:34:59 2015 UTC,"If you tap the right stick to the side your player will shift a step that way so if you're guarding a player on the wing you can use that to position yourself if you think your man is gonna drive to that side. Holding the left trigger (L2) will give make your player go into intense-d mode so if you set yourself up using the right stick and hold down LT as he's driving you should be able to keep him someone on the wing or at the elbows. Sometimes it's hard but once you get used to it it makes defense a lot easier. Also during a game if you do stuff that increases your teammate grade it will turn the momentum toward your team in the game and your teammates will shoot better and guard better (or so I've read, not sure if it's true though)"
NBA2k,3d411o,Sparks0480,1 point,Mon Jul 13 17:42:27 2015 UTC,"One thing to keep in mind is that the teammate grade isn't a reflection of how much points you score but how well you're playing as a whole. My advice is to work on setting screens, getting assists, ge and taking good shots rather than pouring in as much points as much as you can."

Some people had success by just creating a new league and some people (no matter how many leagues they create) remains bugged. Apparently its just an issue that 2K clearly isn't bothered by since its been an issue since release. The only answer is have the owner force the winner/loser after the game is played (if its bugged) or just try a new league (which i find stupid). They need to bring back all the features that were in 2k13 (online association) such as multiple admins, timers, schedules, etc. Getting lazy..."

He is a MASSIVE center and will help you a lot defensively. For your silver I'd suggest someone like Wilson Chandler or Iman Shumpert, guys who can score consistently and provide a lot of defense as well.  EDIT: I'd also suggest Isaiah Canaan at the point. Decent athletic playmaker who can hit the three (not consistently, but he can do it.) Solid bronze point guard. You should be able to pick him up cheap."

NBA2k,3d1gcx,gsano,1 point,Mon Jul 13 00:42:32 2015 UTC,My suggestions are pretty much the same as the rest.  You'll want to improve your shooters and centers: 1.) Upgrade your bronze cards:  PG: Pablo Prigioni has some good shooting and steady passing. SG: Troy Daniels PF: Frank Brickowski is an affordable stretch 4 off the bench.  Easy shot to get off. C: Gobert 2.) Invest in better silvers- Dragic is great if you can afford him. He'll help you win the restricted seeds.  Tyson Chandler is a strong affordable C too.
NBA2k,3d1gcx,HarryLundt,1 point,Mon Jul 13 10:48:36 2015 UTC,"Ditto most of this.

Heck...I'm still stuck in Seed 8 too, so if you like, maybe we could try to play RttP at a prearranged day/time."

I was in your shoes months ago but I got the All Time Scoring Ruby MJ. I sold him and now my team is beastly. Getting like 150k can get you so many good players like LeBron,Other Ruby All Stars, Good big men.  Edit- also do a shit ton of collections like Hakeem's,Russell's,Baylors, Mullins etc."

NBA2k,3d040x,HarryLundt,1 point,Mon Jul 13 14:21:24 2015 UTC,"Just keep him for now and play through Domination. Your lineup is already good enough to beat Domination easily and no sense in buying more players til you know what you get for free.  When you're done with Domination, then reassess.  Onyx Kobe is ""expensive,"" but I think goes for 100-200K MT (?), whereas the really elite players can be 500K+ or even 1M+.  But even 150K MT will be a really nice nest egg and at SG, there are a lot of Gold options for under 10K MT that will not present much of a drop-off from Onyx Kobe."
NBA2k,3d040x,HarryLundt,1 point,Mon Jul 13 18:21:06 2015 UTC,This is prolly what I'm going to do. I think I'm already halfway thru domination so I could finish that pretty quick with Kobe on my team. Thanks homie!
NBA2k,3d040x,BuickGrandNationalX,1 point,Mon Jul 13 18:46:40 2015 UTC,"Yeah...between Kobe and Durant, you have two players with very good post-fadeaways.  And Cousins is solid too.  I think Kobe will rarely be an option to post-up through a Quick Play, so make sure you have a play to call to have him post up and isolated so that you can pass for assist into a post-fadeaway for maximum MT.  Same with Durant if you play him at SF or SG.  If you play Durant at PF, then Quick Play post-up option will probably be to him."

NBA2k,3cytix,RipCity77,4,Sun Jul 12 00:41:49 2015 UTC,Might as well sell your cards. I got 200k MT alone from 100 or so cards so there's value.

NBA2k,3cytix,JV_Zephyr,1 point,Sun Jul 12 20:26:19 2015 UTC,"Not sure I understand your logic...how much MT do you have?  If you need ~130 cards to buy to get to 500, even if you can get them all for 500MT, you'll need 65,000 MT to get to 500.  Don't focus on getting to 500 cards for the bonus. Like others say, focus on finishing Domination, sell what you don't want/need, and play the Auction House for profit.  You'll get to 500 when you get to 500."

NBA2k,3cyhjz,jamster533,2,Sat Jul 11 22:47:35 2015 UTC,Yes.. I am from India and playing myteam has become ridiculous.. Most of them do zigzag cheese and if you contain one player they will find an open man who will be a pd steph or George or melo.  I played My way into 4th seed building my team brick by brick and then it gets demoralising to go against teams with 3 pink diamond players in starting 11. Next year at least they must make the pink diamond earned rather than entering some stupid code through the app.  Not to mention all the codes are released like 3 am in India.. What's the use of buying an expensive game when the very foundation of acquiring players is ridiculous to stay the least.. Expect things to be better in 2k16..Otherwise will do away with this game forever.. Been playing from 2k10 and the last two versions haven't been good at all.

My myTeam is almost how I want it, I have 4 cards left and it will be the team I want, unfortunately 3/4 cards cost more than 100k MT with onyx KG costing over 200k so I don't think I will be getting them and will make do"

Lateral quickness is a stat you want to pay attention to.  Put your quickest guy on the zig zagger that is burning you most.  Then follow without using turbo (R2) or L2.  Contest with right stick when they are about to shoot.  When they trap/ double, put four shooters out there and swing the ball. It only kind of works though."

Maybe dunk contest too but I see that as being a quit fest. Be able to play online. Quick little mini games. That and make it so you can play blacktop online. Maybe a game of 21 with 3 people.

NBA2k,3cx3rr,BoogerSlug,1 point,Sat Jul 11 21:18:02 2015 UTC,This one doesn't bother me much as long as they are commensurate with the challenge.  We'd all like more without restrictions but those with them do force you to switch things up in ways you otherwise wouldn't which is cool.
NBA2k,3cx3rr,gibbons_iyf,6,Sat Jul 11 21:32:45 2015 UTC,Well like someone else commented on a post a while ago that for a game called MyTeam you're not using your team for a lot of the challenges.
NBA2k,3cx3rr,AkimboAR,0,Sat Jul 11 21:52:45 2015 UTC,"Like I said, I do think there should be more w/o restrictions, but actually making them challenging (and if we're getting hung up on names, they're called challenges) is difficult w/o them.  I think just MORE challenges of all kinds is the answer to keeping players happy,  they can't be that hard to put together."
NBA2k,3cx3rr,gibbons_iyf,2,Sat Jul 11 22:01:14 2015 UTC,"Honestly there are a lot of ways to have unrestricted lineup challenges (Beat the dream team in a 7 game series,Beat the 1998 bulls in a 3 game series) and still make them challenging"
NBA2k,3cx3rr,AkimboAR,3,Sat Jul 11 22:22:32 2015 UTC,"Maybe also they could keep fucking supporting it at least through the seasons.  The last challenge was shitty and they stopped putting them out in th middle of the fiucking playoffs.  Also, fuck getting the best players from Twitter codes; that's the most garbage, integrity-destroying game decision I can think of."
NBA2k,3cx3rr,gibbons_iyf,2,Sat Jul 11 21:28:22 2015 UTC,Mikan was a great card around the time that challenge came out. One of the few obtainable 90 overall cards at the time.

This will mark the 2nd occasion where I spent quite a bit of time completing an entire season, and then having this game freeze up during the middle of a halftime show. I'm aware that 2k support looks into things like this, and that the process is brutal- but I've decided to just wait it out until the next 2k comes out. All the meanwhile hoping that 2K looks into addressing small bugs/glitches that you and I have experienced."
NBA2k,3cy6ob,meekspuff,1 point,Sun Jul 12 08:17:23 2015 UTC,"This still happens?  I played through an entire season of 2k13, and after winning the championship, the game just hangs whenever I try to load MyCareer to play through a second season.    What a joke.  I'm considering getting 2k16 when it comes out, but I might flip a table if I buy the game and it breaks down on me again due to some stupid bug."
NBA2k,3cy6ob,_Hewie_,1 point,Mon Jul 13 00:48:24 2015 UTC,"Yep, this injury bug has been plaguing them since 2K12 I believe. It was when they started having the MyPlayer/MyCareer save file saved on their server as well and they haven't fixed this bug. To be honest after getting that injury bug I felt like cancelling my pre-order of the Jordan Edition for 2K16."

NBA2k,3cx5d4,DeadlyPirate,8,Sat Jul 11 15:41:23 2015 UTC,Onyx cards are from Throwback Thursday Onyx packs. I believe they just added Gold Yao randomly throughout the year (Sapphire Yao came later in the challenge.) I've heard Gold Yao has better animations despite a lower overall but haven't tried him myself.

NBA2k,3ctq4k,Professor2k,3,Fri Jul 10 18:23:45 2015 UTC,"Count me in, but as /u/AkimboAR said, 2K really skimped with online leagues this year.  There is essentially no functionality at all (can't even set your lineup), and games often don't even record.  I tried doing a smaller league earlier this year on /r/OA2K15, but ultimately people lost interest due to the mode essentially being neglected this year.  However, I've run very successful leagues in the past, and could help organize and help things run smoothly if there's enough interest."
NBA2k,3ctq4k,The_Jims,1 point,Fri Jul 10 19:50:33 2015 UTC,I am going to test it out because I have not used an online league because they left out the Fantasy Draft option. If not I would like to organize this for 2k16 because I will be making my roster again as I have for the past few years hoping an online fantasy draft would be possible. My ratings and tendencies are from past NBA 2ks and now their throwback Onyx players in MyTeam mode in total I put over 140 players in their prime and added at least 30 guys not in the game even some not in MyTeam.
NBA2k,3ctq4k,The_Jims,2,Fri Jul 10 19:59:44 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it was tough to do a fantasy draft without the feature being in the game, so in /r/OA2K15 we made this spreadsheet to aid with the drafting process.  It does sound like you made a very nice roster, and I'll have to check it out.  It really sucks that 2K skimped so hard on Online Leagues, as they're my favorite game mode.  My guess is it'll be near impossible to find 30 dedicated owners given the mode's shortcomings this year.  But I'm down to help form and set up a league if we can find interested, committed owners."
NBA2k,3ctq4k,Flavs830,1 point,Fri Jul 10 20:05:49 2015 UTC,Good news I just tested a bunch of 1min quarter games and they gave the right results and just having the ability to issue wins and losses is enough for correcting any mistakes. In regards to adjusting your lineup. You are able to do this right before every game you have 30 seconds to do this so I suggest you structure your team accordingly. So if you like playing with 5 sfs as your starting five it may be hard to do both your starting lineup and bench both before the timer expires. I would ask that you draft accordingly. This can definitely work its now just having to find more people I have three including myself already. First step is getting another 5 for an 8 team league and then we can build from their.

NBA2k,3cu1sh,Jahngo,1 point,Sat Jul 11 16:18:11 2015 UTC,"How many shots are you taking to put up 30+ points? Are you always holding the ball or trying to get your team involved? Unfortunately lowering the difficulty also dumbs down your teammates so i would understand if you don't want to defer to them but just scoring a ton of points doesn't mean you're always gonna win.   Try to play within your player's ability and work on doing 1 thing but doing it well. (For example: Choose a shooting form you are comfortable with, develop the shooting attribute and work only taking it when the time is right without forcing it.)  It sounds like you're just getting started on 2K in general though so my advice would be to step away from MyCareer for a little and play some quick games. Use it to get a feel of the mechanics, player movements and which players do what very well."
NBA2k,3cu1sh,HarryLundt,1 point,Sun Jul 12 16:11:40 2015 UTC,"MyCareer, in general, is difficult when you start because your player is rated so poorly.

NBA2k,3cu1sh,ninety4kid,1 point,Sat Jul 11 05:57:31 2015 UTC,"Always go to a team that needs your position play on rookie for the first season. Play 12 minute quarters because you won't be getting any playing time if not. Destroy everyone play the whole rest of the season, since your picked up when the season is almost finished.  You'll collect all the vc you need to make your player better then go onto the next full season as a beast an increase the difficulty to whatever you prefer."
NBA2k,3cu1sh,Americas_American,1 point,Sat Jul 11 20:14:19 2015 UTC,"My number one offensive tip is to try and take advantage of the fast-break. It's the easiest way to get a good look at the basket while the defense still gets set. In the half court just run as many pick and rolls as you can until something opens up. Defensively, just strafe and don't reach in for steals. Stay on your man or you'll give up a lot of open 3s and it will ruin the integrity of your defense."
NBA2k,3cruqe,animal_backwards,4,Fri Jul 10 07:07:53 2015 UTC,Actually I think it's pretty realistic (if you're talking about missed contested dunks).  It's incredibly difficult to jam a ball in over someone and even Vince Carter missed some back in his Raptor days.

NBA2k,3cqzb2,JanMoses,8,Fri Jul 10 01:55:56 2015 UTC,"I've played with a ton of high tier MUT players (Most Jordans, Onyx Dr J, Kidd, Rose etc) and for what it's worth I was extremely disappointed in Ruby Michael Jordan.    It's been a few weeks since I last had Ruby MJ but I did not like his animations, his shot would fluctuate on/off (as far as nailing perfect releases).  Ruby Jordan's defensive stats are ridiculously good but he wouldn't always play great D.  It's weird to say but he was honestly lackluster in many areas and I hated him having volume shooter.  I played many matches with Ruby MJ in RTTP and even more against friends of mine in MUT.  I was running him alongside Onyx Kidd, Onyx Havlicek, Ruby AD & Gold Bill Russell.  He was good, but something was always off.  He'd miss makeable shots or mess up here and there.  He certainly wasn't worth the price IMO.  Because of Ruby Jordan being Jordan, and his pretty substantial price, I gave him a ton of chances to change my mind but I eventually sold him.  I played with a lot of different lineups since then but ended up getting '91 Gold Jordan to play alongside that same lineup (only with Gold Magic Johnson at PF & Ruby Davis at Center).    From the first game I played with '91 MJ he has been absolutely phenomenal.  Despite costing more, he's even better than his price.  His shot release is so fantastic, I'm nailing perfects every time he's open (even from 3) and sometimes when he isn't with deadeye's help.  His defense is much better as well, whether I'm usering or letting the AI pick up.  The only player I've ever had who gets better defensive animations (turning your opponent left or right, cutting off driving lanes, taking charges, making them pick up dribbles etc) is Onyx Jason Kidd and even he's not that much better.  Those two are also the perfect backcourt for pressing and trapping.  If you're thinking about saving the extra MT for Gold Jordan, any 90's version, I absolutely recommend it.  MJ even knocks down 3's effortlessly for me despite his low 3pt rating.  The Gold MJ has a comparatively low tendency for drawing fouls as well but I don't see that in game at all.  He's one of the best players I've ever had for getting to the FT line, and he's automatic there as well.  '91 Jordan is the best player I've ever had in all aspects, only Onyx Kidd & Dr J compare, and I highly recommend him.  You won't be disappointed.  If you're patient on the auction house you can always find one with tons of gold badges too."
NBA2k,3cqzb2,poorchris,8,Fri Jul 10 03:12:50 2015 UTC,Gotta agree on Gold Magic but I'd totally recommend going for Sapphire Julius. He's super consistent for me and you can still pursue Jordan after you sell back!
NBA2k,3cqzb2,pestopete,3,Fri Jul 10 03:52:46 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the recommendations, I just got turned on to the collection reward sapphires and Dr J was one I had my eye on.    Magic's defense is really what does it for me.  He's obviously fantastic to have as a ball handler, especially to mismatch at the 4, but he's brutal in a press/trap defense."
NBA2k,3cqzb2,poorchris,2,Fri Jul 10 04:29:30 2015 UTC,Dr. J is insane...

NBA2k,3cqzb2,BuickGrandNationalX,1 point,Fri Jul 10 03:24:14 2015 UTC,Does Onyx Kobe hold up in comparison?
NBA2k,3cqzb2,poorchris,2,Fri Jul 10 17:24:59 2015 UTC,"Sorry but Onyx Kobe is someone I haven't personally used.  Statistically, he's in the same tier but I didn't like a couple things about him (including volume shooter).  Honestly, once I got '91 MJ I haven't even entertained the idea of swapping him for anyone.  So I've been pouring a lot of MT into big guys, like Onyx Dwight & Ruby Robinson.    I do have experience with Ruby Kobe though, and for his prize range he's fantastic.  I'd prefer the Onyx Dr J or a Gold MJ ('89, '91 or '93) to the Onyx Kobe, but like I said that's without playing him yet."
NBA2k,3cqzb2,BuickGrandNationalX,2,Fri Jul 10 17:32:17 2015 UTC,"Onyx Kobe was my first 99 card, a locker code.  That was the card that hooked me on this game mode.  He's an interesting player.  His release is very, very hard to get perfect because it's so quick, however, I eventually realized you just tap the button and it's close enough, the ball goes in the hole.  He's a player who has those insane animations on dribble moves and layups, but he doesn't have the speed or quickness of MJ.  He's a better finisher than Dunker MJ IMO.  I can't hit a three with kobe.  Ruby 85-86 MJ was like Ray Allen for me when I had him, so it's encouraging that you say 90-91 is a comparable shooter.  I've been eyeing 90-91 MJ for a while.  I also forgot to mention the strength stat.  Kobe and gold MJ are both in that solid 70's range, where as DTF MJ is a 54 strength.  Dr.J has pretty pedestrian animations IMO (though he also has a smooth release), but he is an absolute bully with center-like 95 strength.  That's what makes Sapphire Dr. J such a beast."
NBA2k,3cqzb2,billustan,1 point,Fri Jul 10 18:00:30 2015 UTC,"Hey, I'm just curious, but why don't some people like having volume shooter? Isn't that a good thing so he won't go cold quickly?"
NBA2k,3cqzb2,poorchris,1 point,Fri Jul 10 22:50:58 2015 UTC,"Volume shooter forces you to chuck up shots with whoever has that badge, if you don't they automatically begin going cold.    I hate that because it dictates where my offense has to go and I begin forcing things, which is never how I play.  The only benefit of volume shooter is getting hot even if you're missing shots but I don't see the point of that.  It also doesn't outweigh the negative of having to force shots with one particular player.  Now imagine you have multiple players with volume shooter in your starting five.  You can't take shots with everyone and it's inevitable that one of them will begin to go cold, even if you're trying to spread the wealth on offense.  It's just bothersome to me.  If a player ever has volume shooter added, I'll never buy them.  And 99% of the time I don't target players who come equipped with it off the bat."
NBA2k,3cqzb2,tjwharry,1 point,Fri Jul 10 23:10:57 2015 UTC,"I made the DTF set for the Julius and I don't think I used the Jordan after that. Sold the Jordan for about 20k profit. I might pick up another Jordan, but I don't know where he'd play. I prefer Sapphire Dr J, I prefer to use my SF (Diamond Durant is the best player I've used in the game) and PG (Dimers Payton, though I'm trying out Sapphire Stockton and Dimers Isiah) for my offense."
NBA2k,3cqzb2,KonradKant,1 point,Fri Jul 10 04:01:34 2015 UTC,"The 89 and 91 MJ are arguably the best MJs other than the PD. I upgraded from the DTF to the 89 and I would not have expected the difference to be that big. Get the Sapph Dr J first though, he's also far better than the DTF MJ."

NBA2k,3cok8u,StonesAroundTheSun,1 point,Sat Jul 11 10:12:28 2015 UTC,"In my 3rd season and just went from the Lakers to the Clippers and it's actually the best thing I've ever done. Every freaking game Kobe got healthy again he would tear his hamstring and I would be stuck w all 70 overall players.. Anyways all that to say, I hooked the Clippers (I'm a PG), and now CP3 just gives me the ball every play and I go to work. I can just throw lobs whenever I want and DJ or Blake will always catch and slam them. I had 18 assists in my last game w 6 minute quarters and literally 16 of them were alley oops."

Basketball isn't the first thing I think of when I hear it either. I am glad they're at least diversifying the genres available tho. If Nas on the tracklist is any indication, I'd be absolutely stoked for more 90s east coast hip hop.   The Zedd song is garbage, I'm with you on that one."

NBA2k,3co20z,DaHomieBigWick,-1,Thu Jul 9 13:43:29 2015 UTC,I hope this mean going back to a global spectrum of music. 2k put me onto MGMT and I will always love them for that but ever since they let JayZ produce it it has gone to shit with too many rap songs. The diversity it used to have was playlist worthy. Pharrell did a good job last year but it was still too much rap. I hope they bring the balance back

NBA2k,3cpmyb,Professor2k,2,Fri Jul 10 10:48:52 2015 UTC,"I tend to play MyLeague a lot. Typically until the 2030's. I frequently end up with ridiculously over powered teams without cheating (adjusting sliders to my benefit). I build dynasties so easily i will turn the sliders to the maximum against me other then moral. I would recommend turning the draft class quality down to at least 35, when choosing the sliders before starting the league. If you do not you will frequently have high level 80's coming into the draft every couple of years. Currently the most recent player over 80 that came into NBA 2K as a rookie was Anthony Davis as a 81 I believe. This is obviously a recommendation. Have fun!"
NBA2k,3cpmyb,Acertop95,1 point,Fri Jul 10 17:12:24 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I noticed that without tinkering with the draft classes the league gets ruined by stacked drafts year after year, much like it did back in 2k11. It gets boring very fast that way, but at least 2k15 has a draft class quality slider unlike 2k11 from what I remember  edit: You can also apparently adjust draft quality any time in MyLeague (not just when you create a new game) which is great"

NBA2k,3cq2f1,TriIICosby,1 point,Sat Jul 11 01:06:34 2015 UTC,"I play on Hall of Fame and regularly beat the cpu on the default setting. Occasionally 2K decides that the cpu will hit every shot and that I will miss open ones with next to perfect releases and loose. But hey I wouldn't play it if that never happened.When I first started playing 2k this year I couldn't beat any of my friends or even an all-star computer. This is coming from someone who has played since AI was on the cover 2k1 on Sega Dreamcast. Start playing on pro with your favorite team and relearn the game once you destroy the computer by at least 20 switch to a higher difficulty. Some extra tips: the Post Fade is your best friend with Melo, Durant, Kobe. Kickouts to corner threes are meant to be shot in this game. Use the right stick to guard your man with tiny pivots of the left stick to stay in front of your man. The computer will not go out passed the 3pt line so play on ball D on the perimeter. You can stop alley oops by bumping into the guy who is about to go up for the alley. Tap x or square whenever you know the guy your defending is gassed no matter who your playing as, most of the time you will poke the ball loose. Do not use crossovers while running into traffic you will turn the ball over. Have fun!"
NBA2k,3cq2f1,Professor2k,1 point,Fri Jul 10 17:25:12 2015 UTC,"Move to simulation sliders for all difficulties. That won't fix your problem necessarily. But it's a best practice.  Some times people say the CPU hits everything and then when you look at the box score, the shooting percentages aren't bad.  Look at your box scores and confirm they really do hit everything. If so, I would do one of two things:  1) Move down the difficulty. 2) Pick a team and play it over and over until you learn how to get their shot percentage down. Some of it is just familiarity with a team that will help you play better defense.  I don't usually recommend adjusting the sliders if you also play users online, but if you only play the CPU, that's an option to.  Good luck!"

NBA2k,3cl89q,IMNOTMATT,2,Fri Jul 10 01:05:15 2015 UTC,"If you wanna keep doing pick and rolls I know Thibs (ironically bulls coach) has that as a point of emphasis. Other coaches like Kerr and Jason Kidd have the shooters get open option. Ultimately its up to you to preset your points of emphasis to how you'd like, but coaches do add overall offensive and defensive stats. If you can get a Popovich from auction house he instantly makes your whole team better.   Be sure to set crash the offensive boards too. It wouldn't seem like much, but I'd get 10+ offensive rebounds a game after doing that, which is basically a free 60+ credits before you account for baskets made off the rebound."

I never spend money on 2K outside of the cost of the game but I can already see people complaining about how much they spend if they keep similar pack odds so that it ends up meaning they spend the most and have the least. I think MyTeam would have the greatest ideas if purely seen as a 'earn everything' mode. We know that wont happen though.

NBA2k,3cknt6,PacificBrim,2,Wed Jul 8 18:49:23 2015 UTC,Yup! And they all put up reasonable stats
NBA2k,3cknt6,thm2130,12,Wed Jul 8 21:42:18 2015 UTC,"I made one for xbox, GT: Lacky21  Spent a lot of time touching up faces and ratings with the top 60 prospects in the draft. My two highest ratings are Okafor and Winslow at a 77, with Okafor's potential at a 91 and Winslow's at a 86. Russell is a 76 with a 93 potential, porzingis starts at a 75 with a low 80's potential, and karl towns is a 75 with the highest potential in the whole draft at a 94 I think. most of the other guys go down accordingly with a few breaking into the 80 potential rating with maybe one gem in the high 80's in potential"
NBA2k,3cknt6,thm2130,5,Wed Jul 8 19:28:10 2015 UTC,"That's awesome, thanks! Anything is better than 85 overall free agents and 90 overall Porzingas. Thanks!"
NBA2k,3cknt6,sharke93,2,Wed Jul 8 19:43:51 2015 UTC,"Yea I tried to make them as realistic to the game as possible with potentials working accordingly. every time I go into the draft, top 4 usually drafted are russell, towns, okafor, and winslow. hopefully you enjoy it!"
NBA2k,3cknt6,thm2130,2,Wed Jul 8 19:46:56 2015 UTC,Looked at your roster. Just wanted to say that D'Angelo Russell looks absolutely fantastic. It's hard to get realistic looking players in the game but he looks awesome.
NBA2k,3cknt6,sharke93,2,Thu Jul 9 02:24:34 2015 UTC,Hey thanks I really appreciate that! Ill admit I took a little bit longer trying to get Russell the best I could since Im a sixers fan and was really REALLY banking on him being on our roster 😔
NBA2k,3cknt6,thm2130,2,Thu Jul 9 03:26:19 2015 UTC,Hey I'm a Sixers fan too! Jah has looked awesome so far doe. I'm looking forward to seeing him playing against KAT in the Vegas SL.
NBA2k,3cknt6,sharke93,1 point,Thu Jul 9 03:51:35 2015 UTC,"Yea, he looked pretty clumsy in the first half of the first game. he went like 3-11 or something right? but then picked it up in the second half and finished with some respectable numbers. And that second game his defense looked a little better. I think he'll look a lot better once the season starts instead of trying to play with four other guys on the floor who are literally playing for their lives. McRae jacking up shots left and right doesn't help either. Summer league is all about that AAU hero ball shit, but once he's playing under brown and running in an actual organized system, that's when we're going to see Jah shine in my opinion."
NBA2k,3cknt6,irelli,1 point,Thu Jul 9 04:01:37 2015 UTC,Agreed. Just surround him with shooters everywhere and we're good.
NBA2k,3cknt6,thm2130,2,Thu Jul 9 05:00:09 2015 UTC,"I feel like you're overrating Winslow a little bit.  Also, Pozingis has the most potential of anyone in the draft -- but potential is so silly in  2k because they always reach it."
NBA2k,3cknt6,wikisaiyan,1 point,Thu Jul 9 06:06:09 2015 UTC,"yea, feel free to download mine and change it up and reupload it for everyone else! imo winslow is one of the most nba ready players in this draft next to okafor. I kept his potential at an 86 though because although I think he'll be good, he won't ever be some superstar/hall of fame type player in the long run. Also I'm going to have to disagree with you on porzingis having the most potential. I think he'll be ok, but he's not going to carry the knicks to any championships. I based my ratings off of what I think will really happen instead of realistic ""what if's"" or ""maybe's"""
NBA2k,3cknt6,irelli,1 point,Thu Jul 9 17:46:03 2015 UTC,"Well in ""2k15-world"" I think ""potential "" will become there max rating they reach in their prime.  In the ""real-world"", potential just means what a player has a ""chance"" to become.  Basically 2k potential and actual potential are different things."
NBA2k,3cknt6,thm2130,2,Thu Jul 9 18:33:44 2015 UTC,"But then how can we possibly do things accurately?  Do I make Porzingis the best player in the draft because he could become the best player? Or do I not because he might bust?  They just need to add a ""bust rating"" or something along those lines. You know, the odds that they never reach their full potential."
NBA2k,3cknt6,wikisaiyan,2,Thu Jul 9 18:41:24 2015 UTC,that would be awesome
NBA2k,3cknt6,_masterofdisaster,1 point,Thu Jul 9 18:54:03 2015 UTC,"I think the best thing for right now is to go w/ your gut and make it so that a guy like porzingis will have potential in low to mid 80 or high 70s.  But I like your idea of ""bust rating""."

NBA2k,3cmnu1,boomsticker92,2,Thu Jul 9 02:26:49 2015 UTC,WorldGaming or Gamersaloon are sites that do this. It definitely makes the games more fun (and frustrating) when money is on the line.
NBA2k,3cmnu1,Gabrielc3,1 point,Fri Jul 10 21:39:27 2015 UTC,"Thanks /u/Gabrielc3 for the feedback. I checked out both sites. Seems like WorldGaming is better for 2K. Have you use either of them? If so, what were your thoughts?"

NBA2k,3chocy,lukelear,1 point,Wed Jul 8 19:35:12 2015 UTC,Oh yeah. I think it's from when they updated his tendencies or something following that stretch in the middle of the season where he had a fuck load of triple doubles and was playing really well. His potential is so high it ends up with him getting way better than he actually is or something and he always ends up averaging DAMN close to a triple double for like 5 seasons in a row. It's fucking insane.

NBA2k,3clpq0,iidesune,-1,Thu Jul 9 02:36:30 2015 UTC,Yeah because he hit 7 threes in the first quarter. 17 ÷ 28 = ~61%
NBA2k,3clpq0,AndreNegrodala,-1,Thu Jul 9 04:46:34 2015 UTC,Typical cheese logic. That guy hit 3s so I'm going to triple his amounts of 3s!

NBA2k,3clpq0,AndreNegrodala,-3,Thu Jul 9 17:24:12 2015 UTC,Yes they continue to shoot 3s but no one shoots 28 you idiot. Do you watch basketball? And no one gives a shit then if it's my league. You could have easily changed the sliders. Shit post

NBA2k,3cftah,TheKing4Real,98,Tue Jul 7 16:06:07 2015 UTC,"Cosign. Unfortunately, 2K seems to be putting all their time in effort into MyTeam and the terrible MyPlayer ""story"" that gives you ""RPG elements"", but really it just gives you cutscenes with 2 choices of response that have no effect on the game. These are also the 2 modes you're most likely to spend VC, either to buy packs or improve your MyPlayer without playing. Gone are the days of revamped MyGM/Association modes with cool features (but you get your coach in your office every 4 games asking you to change your gameplan or adjust your practice intensity), 24/7 mode is never coming back, we can't even have the old 3 point contest minigame. Really hope EA steps up a little bit this year because I'm tired of 2K trying to bank on microtransactions rather than focusing on the true fans of the game."
NBA2k,3cftah,clnsdabst,7,Tue Jul 7 16:19:19 2015 UTC,The problem with hoping for EA to save us is that they do the exact same microtransaction bullshit with their other sports games (see FIFA as a perfect example).  So I'm not holding my breath
NBA2k,3cftah,tokeallday,3,Tue Jul 7 16:53:52 2015 UTC,"Outside of Ultimate Team I don't remember any microtransactions that affected gameplay that much. Career mode worked fine as both a player and manager without the EAFC boosts, especially for manager mode...MyGM still feels like a cash grab to me, but I'm glad MyLeague is back."
NBA2k,3cftah,jdotliu,2,Tue Jul 7 19:02:25 2015 UTC,"Yeah EA is probably the worst of all in terms of microtrans. My hope for them to step up isn't so I can play Live, it's to kick 2k in the butt so they work harder to please the core fan base."
NBA2k,3cftah,clnsdabst,20,Tue Jul 7 17:49:31 2015 UTC,"I swear, 2k made it hard to get VC on purpose this year. They have the AI always comeback at the ends of games and beat you to screw you out of 40 minutes of work and all your VC. Don't even get me started on MY TEAM. I i tried about 15 times, and i can not even beat the 3rd team. Probably because my best player is CJ Wilcox, but still.   Mind telling me what 24/7 mode is?"
NBA2k,3cftah,clnsdabst,16,Tue Jul 7 16:26:52 2015 UTC,"24/7 was like MyPlayer but with a street ball style. The only way to increase your attributes was to play challenges (mostly 1v1, 2v2, some had weird rules) and do training. Move up and then they had boss battles vs. top players. It wasn't perfect and it needed a lot of work but it was a fun change of pace from being in the NBA all the time, it had a cool me against the world vibe."
NBA2k,3cftah,jdotliu,7,Tue Jul 7 16:36:31 2015 UTC,"Don't remember it 100%, but it had a story too and you were basically a streetballer trying to get into the EBC at Rucker and you would have to do all these challenges at several major cities, and also win a certain amount of open runs at each city (each with their own pool of NBA players) to get invited. It was pretty cool being able to see the teams playing already and being allowed to call next and just watch the game before you unfold before you had to play the winning team. Also some of the challenges were insane like reverse controls, tiny sized ball that was hard to steal/block but easy to shoot, etc.  For 2K5 I think, they took 24/7 to the next level in that your attributes would go down if you didn't play the mode for a while."
NBA2k,3cftah,jdotliu,2,Tue Jul 7 16:35:18 2015 UTC,"wait, what? That sounds fucking awesome."

NBA2k,3cftah,justrelax2k2,18,Tue Jul 7 17:14:29 2015 UTC,The thing I miss most is the ability to do shoot around or hold a pickup game with draft prospects. It gave you a feel for the players.
NBA2k,3cftah,jdotliu,5,Tue Jul 7 18:43:06 2015 UTC,I loved that! You could scout the players by basically bringing them in for a workout and they would play against each other and other drills. It was awesome and it sucks that the scouting of draft prospects is so much less interactive despite them adding a lot of information the prospects
NBA2k,3cftah,thephoenixx,3,Wed Jul 8 02:19:57 2015 UTC,It was pretty shitty though...all made up players and no significant development for the players sent there. It was just a place to stash away some washed up player and see him drop 30 PPG for fun.
NBA2k,3cftah,tjthegr8,16,Tue Jul 7 17:15:09 2015 UTC,"Actually it wasn't just made up players.  This may have just been 2k11 but when I looked around the d league rosters I saw guys like Jeremy Lin , hassan Whiteside etc.  Players who eventually made waves in the nba."
NBA2k,3cftah,strifeblood,3,Tue Jul 7 17:53:09 2015 UTC,"Are you sure that it was the default rosters? I remember them being all generic but it was pretty cool how some of the guys that weren't signed would eventually appear on D-League rosters randomly during Association.  What I'm saying is that there should've been some benefit to sending players down, all you got to see was your raw project put up like 18 RPG since all the generics sucked except for like 2 with 99 shot tendencies."
NBA2k,3cftah,jdotliu,2,Tue Jul 7 19:04:45 2015 UTC,"Yeah like someone below said, a lot of the players were real, though I'd guess not all of them as they would have to pad out the rosters.    I wish it was a fully fledged mode similar to sending a baseball player down to AAA where you could request that the D-League coach help the player you send down focus on a particular aspect if you wish.  Adding to that, I wish the coach attributes were far more fleshed out and thought out as well.  Maybe they did that in next-gen MyGM but on PS3 it's been the same shitty unimproved ratings system since at least 2K11.  If the coaches had specialties that gave some players a boost or made them clash with certain types it'd be neat. And actually thinking through the trainer ratings would be helpful....giving the Suns Aaron Nelson a C is fucking hilarious."
NBA2k,3cftah,brockman44,10,Wed Jul 8 03:57:05 2015 UTC,"I actually want this for MyCareer, especially since there's a precedent for it. Back in 2K11 you could play summer league and potentially get sent to D League."
NBA2k,3cftah,jdotliu,4,Tue Jul 7 18:24:44 2015 UTC,They got rid of it because people who were new or sucked at the game didn't want to play in the D League.

NBA2k,3cftah,WOX_69,7,Tue Jul 7 16:40:44 2015 UTC,"2K5 out sold Live because it was priced at like 20 dollars. It made headlines because of the drastic price cut they made to compete.  Edit: and no, I said wait for the gameplay to catch up eventually since 2K is pretty much focusing on making the moneymaking modes more polished vs cleaning up gameplay...sorta like Live went all out on graphics and disregarded gameplay/modes when the Xbox 360/PS3 generation just started just because they were in the better position back then."

The price was extra. those games were CLEARLY better and the reviews showed it.  https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&rlz=1C1GIWA_enUS592US592&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#q=espn%202k5%20review
NBA2k,3cftah,WOX_69,5,Tue Jul 7 17:04:36 2015 UTC,"...Live 2005 was the first year they added back the 3 point competition from the PS1 era and included the Slam Dunk competition for the first time. The ASW festivities were very well received during the time.  What does 2K's NFL product have anything to do with comparing basketball simulations? No shit, 2K5 was better than Madden for a very long time, and Madden is the franchise being lazy that got saved through the exclusive deal. There's no exclusive deal for the NBA so I'm just looking forward to the complacent party get burned and a better product being out there for us consumers."

NBA2k,3cftah,Cacklemoore,3,Tue Jul 7 17:13:02 2015 UTC,"I would at the very least like to have the NBA D-League back in the game. It's hard realistically build your team if you have to trade and cut players who would be able to play in the D-League for a few seasons when you can only have 15 players per team.  Does anyone know if 2K Sports lost the rights to the D-League and Summer Leagues? I remember them being on last-gen's 2K14, but not the next-gen."
NBA2k,3cftah,BigPaperCompany,3,Tue Jul 7 20:09:22 2015 UTC,"I completely agree, we should be able to do anything a real NBA gm can do, including buy draft picks, trade for cash or a trade exception,  or even stash players in Europe. MY GM is supposed to be a NBA front office simulator, and currently it's missing a lot of features. Like why can't we do sign and trades, and why can't we make draft selection for other teams if they set up a trade, or why can't we trade players during free agency? Or why can't we have multiple altrnitve rotations instead of just one, and why can't we design plays...  Some of the stuff missing boggles my mind.... basic features...."

NBA2k,3chgng,WeirdChi,1 point,Wed Jul 8 01:03:18 2015 UTC,"They say they hated 7'0 SF and 7""3 PGs, yet they never fixed it   Hopefully in next years verision. I remember a few months back LD said in one of his streams he had already talked to Devs about putting height caps in the park. Really wish they actually do something about it."
NBA2k,3chgng,keciga,1 point,Wed Jul 8 01:33:40 2015 UTC,"Height caps are stupid. If you have a center who's 7'7"", and even has speed 99, he should move like Shawn Bradley on steroids. A 7'2"" center with speed 99 should outrun him, and a 6'4"" player with 99 should be able to run circles around him. Height and weight are not the problem - unrelated attributes are."
NBA2k,3chgng,WeirdChi,1 point,Wed Jul 8 21:46:11 2015 UTC,"Fair point. Though height caps still need to happen. Multiple times (Even with a friend who has his own 7'2 center) have other tall unreal players grab boards while being boxed out just because a simple 1' vert has their head over the rim.   I've had those same players stand on the right side of the rim, get a rebound on the LEFT because they have maxed out arm length. Both issues need work."
NBA2k,3chgng,keciga,1 point,Wed Jul 8 22:03:12 2015 UTC,"Now imagine someone making a 7'7"" center a la Shawn Bradley and giving all they get into speed and athleticism, and they really would get all the rebounds. Once they would drag their ass in like 12 seconds from basket to basket. All I'm saying is - if these attributes were relative, it would mean that having such a player would also have bad side effects. Slow speed, low agility (even if maxed out!) and almost no chance of leaping twice in a row. On the other hand, a 6'10"" center would be able to sprint back on D or up the court on fast breaks and leap over such immovable objects like the one from the beginning of the story. Yes, there should be height caps, but they should be set to precedents. No player over 7'7"" or under 5'3"" ever played in the NBA, and you should be able to create such a player."
NBA2k,3chgng,WeirdChi,1 point,Wed Jul 8 22:24:59 2015 UTC,"No player over 7'7"" or under 5'3"" ever played in the NBA, and you should be able to create such a player.   Reasons for that, but in a game sure. Just not for online play. The reason height caps are easier to do is look at 2ks track record - Centers have always been nearly as fast when running up court next to your fully maxed out PG/SG/SF etc. There will always be cheese, you can't find a perfect fix. I rather deal with a max cappped 6'10 dudes than 7'2 slow ones because they will find the way to work it their way."
NBA2k,3chgng,keciga,1 point,Wed Jul 8 22:53:39 2015 UTC,"It's true that people find exploits quickly and there is no real hope that we will see a game free of exploits. However, not all people play that way. I think I'd love to try and play with a Shawn Bradley like guy and try to avoid getting dunked on all the time. I know that most people wouldn't wait for me to slowly stroll from defence. They would attack the basket or shot threes without me and I wouldn't be in position to get an offensive rebound."

NBA2k,3chorp,diamondKD,9,Wed Jul 8 00:36:23 2015 UTC,"They just need to get rid of PDs or make them rewards for hard challenges and fix how they release the Lockercodes. My idea was to have timed codes on special days but the sooner you put in the code the better the odds of the codes are (e.g. KG's draft day = a random KG card lockercode (silver, onyx, rubies) under 1 minute has a higher chance of getting onyx/ruby (50%), lowering every 5 or so minutes until there is only 10% chance to get ruby/onyx KG)  Possible days  Draft Days (mainly for longevity players KG, Parish, KAJ)  Birthdays (fan favorites/past cover athletes, Kobe, D-Rose, Korver)  All-Star (basically any player who made the all-star team, guaranteed Ruby)  Finals MVP (spread through out the playoffs, past FMVPs ending with the newest)  Special Dates (Kobe's 81, Wilt's 100, TD's 20/20, Howards (20/20)  Season record holders (2016 scoring/assist/rebound/steal/block leaders, guranteed Ruby)  Season MVP (Spread throughout season, past MVP ending with current)  The goal should be to always have at least one timed locker code running (make them last around 2-3 days each). The timing thing gives urgency but not too much since it is not guaranteed to give a good player but if you didn't get a good one this time there is always on 2 days away to look forward to getting a better card"

So they troll the people who wasted an hour of their life then release it to Twitter where it wasn't necessary to watch them brick shots and listen to them complain about some of the broken parts of the gameplay.

NBA2k,3cie57,csikai,5,Wed Jul 8 03:41:16 2015 UTC,"I have one for each game mood Im in  PG - If I just want to take over and get a triple double. Make him well rounded because the difference between max at something and half max is barely anything.  SG - If I want to drop 100. SG is by far the best scorer in the game.  SF - If I want to do everything, including defending. I get On Court Coach ASAP for my SF so I can play point forward. Upgrade OS, Ath, and PM on SF and it's my favorite position.  PF - Lots of people prefer to play stretch 4 with their PF, but I hate that. Theyre never as good of shooters and if I do want to just shoot, Ill use 1-3. I make my PF like TT. I max out rebounding, athleticism and defense and thats basically it. I just stand under the rim and grab offensive boards and put them back.  C - Generally I like to make a 7 footer and have him win DPOY. I tend to do a lot more post ups with C than with my PF. Very fun to play with a max ath C."
NBA2k,3cie57,Harden-Soul,5,Wed Jul 8 19:41:13 2015 UTC,PF / C seem to have the cheapest upgrades overall relative to the other positions. After one season you can usually max out athleticism and handles.
NBA2k,3cie57,jontaffer69,1 point,Wed Jul 8 18:54:13 2015 UTC,"With a PG, you have the ball in your hands almost all the time. SG/SF are really athletic and well rounded positions. You can shoot from anywhere, drive to the rim, be a playmaker, get rebounds and occasionally get steals or blocks.  PF/C is fun if you like post moves, the mid range game, getting rebounds and blocking shots."
NBA2k,3cie57,strifeblood,1 point,Wed Jul 8 17:01:00 2015 UTC,"I played a lot as a PG and a PF, and now I've started my SF career.  With PG, you will be able to call plays and set the overall tone. Calling plays enables you to make your teammates a bit better, especially if you can make them shoot when they're open with your On Court Coach badge. With PF, you are not setting the tone much within the flow of the game unless you call for the ball a lot.  On 12 minute Hall of Fame level, as PF I was able to average 37p 19r 9a 4b 2st, with fg% .56, 3p% .39, ft% .89. Obviously, I maxed outside shooting, athleticism and playmaking."
NBA2k,3cie57,keciga,1 point,Wed Jul 8 21:35:27 2015 UTC,"I just finished my first season as a Shooting Guard with Portland Trailblazers, the only reason why I chose a SG was that I will have the potential to play with really good players in:   Cleveland Cavaliers (James, Irving, Love) OKC (Westbrook, Durant, Ibaka) LAC (CP3, Griffin)   So I'm considering if I should start a new career with a PG but I don't get many options if I do go PG since the top tier teams have really good PGs. The only team that comes to mind would be Houston Rockets (Harden, Howard)"

NBA2k,3cie57,aceofspadez138,1 point,Fri Jul 10 02:54:13 2015 UTC,Mines between the forwards. Power because I like to go old school back to the basket crushing them with post moves. Then small forward because I can do everything from scoring to defense and usually get a decent stat line even on hall of fame. Only negative is I unintentionally got volume scorer on SF and said fuck it and upgraded to gold. So I'm sure my hawks teammates hate it when I lose a game when shooting 17/38 or love me when we win and I shot 21/32. No  inbetween.

Since the last patch, offense is really hard to stop and the best thing you can do now is just play on-ball as best you can. The NAPP system is the most effective defensive scheme I've used. The only thing I do to vary it, is to use half-court traps and 3-2 zones every odd possession. When you change up your defensive sets, it tends to throw off your opponents pretty well."

NBA2k,3ce8nc,llamalegs100,3,Tue Jul 7 11:18:45 2015 UTC,"get a lot of shooters and run Spurs playbook, best strategy ever"
NBA2k,3ce8nc,cooReey,1 point,Tue Jul 7 12:52:41 2015 UTC,"as a MyPlayer PG for the Kings this seems to generally be my experience. Rudy Gay has a pretty reliable 3 pointer if you hit him in the corner. If you hit him in the corner, but that can also transition into a dunk. Cousins is good mid-range if you draw two people in with a pic on a reliable passer like Collison, but with Jennings you could rely on  him too. Mclemore works as a back up point, but is a sort of reliable 3 point shooter.  If you want to get Cousins more touches/playbook then just set him as your first shooter in the minutes/playbook shooter and then put in him a P&R situation where he's the Pick. Once he's set it he tends to drive to the Key, where you can set him up for either a layup/fadeaway or midrange jumper. If you set Gay as Second choice shooter then if Cousins doesn't make it to the key as a free man, then enough attention might have been drawn for a Gay 3pt/drive to the basket.   Playbook wise maybe look to a team that relies heavily on a PF/C as a score like the Pelicans or maybe the Knicks (slight assumption since Melo is the only decent player on the team)."
NBA2k,3ce8nc,nyluhe,1 point,Tue Jul 7 13:26:53 2015 UTC,"I'd try the Mavs playbook and set DC as your number 1 option. Their playbook has heaps of pick n' roll plays, which a quick slasher like Jennings thrives on, and if they get around the pick you can just pass it to Cousins as he runs to the hoop (a la pick and pop style)  In addition to this, Mavs book also has some good 3 point plays, so if they start jamming the paint then you can just flick it out to Gay for some slick 3's  Edit; also, when sitting on the lead try and be more patient and slow the game down by posting up with DC, post faders are absolutely deadly in this game and it's a good way to rack up points off high percentage shots (currently doing this with Jabari Parker in my 4th year bucks GM and it's working like a charm)"
NBA2k,3chb1m,lw38,3,Tue Jul 7 22:21:09 2015 UTC,Its not credited in the nba. Itd just be a turnover.
NBA2k,3chb1m,emerica0250,2,Wed Jul 8 01:02:53 2015 UTC,Doesn't count as a steal if you don't give your team possession of the ball. If you tip a pass or strip an opposing player of the ball and it just goes out of bounds and your team doesn't receive possession immediately afterwards it doesn't count as a steal. Same rules in the NBA as they are in 2K.
NBA2k,3chb1m,lukelear,1 point,Wed Jul 8 06:48:07 2015 UTC,*goes out of bounds
NBA2k,3chb1m,keciga,1 point,Tue Jul 7 22:21:46 2015 UTC,"If you tip a pass or poke the ball off the handler and it ends up with the ball going out of bounds and in your team's possession (off someone else's hand, foot or anything), it still won't go as your own steal, but the game does sometimes reward you with teammate grade (""forced turnover""). However, it is not consistent enough. In other words, no statistical gain, only pat on the back. It's the same with real life box scores that don't show great defensive players making opponents commit turnovers."

NBA2k,3cc0jh,I_Is_Batman,6,Tue Jul 7 02:28:21 2015 UTC,"If it were mimicking FIFA Ultimate Team, it would be on a weekly basis. FUT also has Team of the Year (best 11 players voted on by FIFA), Team of the Season (best players picked on a league to league basis), Man of the Match (chosen for highly significant games like Champions League, World Cup, and National Cup finals), Hero (for incredible play that helped the team get promoted or survive relegation), St. Patrick's Day (just a special set of green cards for Irish players), Record Breaker (fastest hat trick, most goals scored in a competitions history), and Legend cards.

NBA2k,3cc0jh,KonyInTheHouse,19,Tue Jul 7 14:12:19 2015 UTC,"Not just NBA Live but every single EA Ultimate Team in general. First off on Throwback Thursdays don't have the same cards in there every single week. Add a new 5 every week and don't keep putting the same ones in there.  We don't need 10 different packs. Make a bronze pack, a silver pack, a gold pack, and an additional pack for when new cards come out on Thursday. Like EA does when Team of the Week comes out on Wednesday, at least on FIFA. Have tournaments that give you bonuses instead of just RTTP. One tournament with 3 silvers max, one tournament with 3 golds max, and one unrestricted tournament. Winner of bronze tournament gets like 1000 MT and a Bronze pack. Winner of Silver gets 3000 and a silver pack. Gold winner gets 5000 MT and a gold pack. Make it so in packs you're guaranteed a gold if you get a gold pack, it doesn't matter if they're shitty, just throw them in there. If you don't have enough total golds add FIBA players in as well, thus bumping up the number of total players. Even in the golds aren't as good at least there as some. However for TBT packs don't guarantee Onyx's.  The best players should be rare. I know everybody says they work and try to get good players but not everyone should be able to use the best players in the game. If you've ever played FIFA before coin buying was huge it was nearly impossible to get Messi or Ronaldo without spending endless hours trading and getting profit from cards. Do something like FIFA's Team of the Year where all the best players from the world get ridiculous cards. Also do something like Team of the Season where they release upgraded cards from players in different leagues which make it so players that aren't great already can get good upgraded cards. That way people that can't afford the best players can still play with good upgraded cards. They could make an upgraded team for each division of the NBA. Don't make cards untradable. It's so stupid. If someone wants to sell PD Melo or PD Malone they should be able to. That way the cards can get spread out more instead of people just having the cards and no-one else ever getting to use them.  Just get rid of locker codes. They are stupid."

I played 2k13 myTeam religiously and wanted Hakeem, Shaq, Wilt so bad but could never seem to pull them. In 2k15 I can go to the auction house and buy them instead.  I would prefer an auction house with the team packs from 2k14 and collections that lock. Thus it is easier to complete a collection but there are less cards on the market so cards still have value  Edit: I also want guaranteed packs too, such as guaranteed or at least better pull rates for emerald, onyx, ruby cards. I'm tired of saving up 50k VC and then not getting a single resell-able card for more than 3k.

One of the better ways to upgrade a position a little, but likely not a ton. I used it to turn Gary Neal and a 2018 1st round pick in to Harrison Barnes and a shit player (who I waived anyway).   Edit: the screen will also say interest level insufficient if they won't go for the bait and switch, so you shouldn't lose it"
NBA2k,3cexwd,Aregisteredusername,1 point,Tue Jul 7 14:41:54 2015 UTC,"It will say ""interest level insufficient"" if the trade is way too one-sided and they have literally no interest.

I just started as a PG and I'm learning this in my 2nd season with the Sixers...at least we have good big men for the future (although they bring Noel off the bench because he's technically a center...)  To answer your question though, I would definitely try to get yourself traded out of there.  Unless you're married to the Mavs I'm sure you could find a much better situation elsewhere."

Otherwise, it's too late to stop the Demi-God glitch since 2K is focusing on 2K16. Plus, all of the noobs that do the glitch end up spending tons of VC to get their player beyond a 62.

NBA2k,3c87po,I_Is_Batman,41,Sun Jul 5 23:39:25 2015 UTC,Harden is simply not Lebron 97+ worthy in any way shape or form. Absolutely not.
NBA2k,3c87po,Retrokicker13,10,Mon Jul 6 11:46:05 2015 UTC,"Why not? He finished the season with 27/7/6. Pretty well rounded game, all he has to do is improve his defense a bit, which he is already doing.   Btw I hate how 2k rates their players. I think the highest rated should be like it is in FIFA. LBJ should be a ~93 and everyone else should be rated respectively after that."
NBA2k,3c87po,I_Is_Batman,12,Mon Jul 6 11:51:43 2015 UTC,"Why? I think it is an okay system that Jordan is 99 and other players are rated after that, with LeBron as a 97-98. The ratings in MT are ludicrous though. Maybe it would be better if the normal cards were in the FIFA range while the MT special cards were up to 99"
NBA2k,3c87po,gnewd,-5,Mon Jul 6 12:52:38 2015 UTC,"Harden gets a lot of his points on bad foul calls. More so than anyone else in the league, so I think his stats are a little misleading.  As for your last point I completely agree. Maybe Lebron is at a 96-97, I'd give him that... We all know he isn't Jordan, so for them to have the same the same rating is just totally skewed. Especially when you look at a guy like AD, who I believe finished with a 95 rating this year... Only 4 points lower than the GOAT? That's where the ratings are completely flawed."

NBA2k,3c87po,badnuws,-4,Mon Jul 6 14:08:33 2015 UTC,"Harden's defense is horrific.  There is a 11 minute video on YouTube to prove it.

NBA2k,3c87po,fdylan23,1 point,Tue Jul 7 07:09:57 2015 UTC,"that video is from last season, hardens defence has seemed to improve although mostly in the hustle department Yes harden draws fouls where there aren't any, no dispute. Lebron gets a lot of calls, the refs respect him, this NBA finals was the first time I've seen them really avoid the calls but it was a rough series in general, so they were lenient."
NBA2k,3c87po,badnuws,2,Wed Jul 8 08:57:58 2015 UTC,"LeBron gets a lot of calls because he gets fouled a lot.  I also believe that Harden's defense has improved since that video, but is his defense elite?  Above average? I don't believe it is."

NBA2k,3c87po,higashi_miyagi,1 point,Wed Jul 8 09:21:04 2015 UTC,"To say LeBron struggles to get calls is laughable. He gets plenty of fouls drawn, and a fair share of them come from flopping/exaggerated contact. I'm not saying he doesn't get legitimately fouled, he does a lot, but it's not like he has to seriously fight to get a whistle in his favor. I think it's fair to say Harden's defense is much improved, but pretty average. Sometimes I don't even blame the guy for being so mediocre on defense when you consider how much he has to expend on the offensive end. It can be difficult and tiring when you're the only guy who can create on offense and have to do it for the type of minutes he logs for just about almost every game of an NBA season.  Edit - Also, I do feel like when LeBron is no longer the top rated current NBA player it will be a close race between AD and KD as the top rated players with Harden and Curry a few points lower."

NBA2k,3c87po,Kenton1321,14,Mon Jul 6 06:35:15 2015 UTC,"Lebron's game doesn't work for a near 40 year old. Not unless he starts to utilize his post game more (Similar to how Jordan did after his first retirement), or work on a better jump shot. The reason Duncan is still productive is because he needs next to no athletic ability to still be able to function, therefore he puts less wear and tear on his body."
NBA2k,3c87po,Rancho2Valley,6,Mon Jul 6 10:36:00 2015 UTC,"Lebron relies heavily on athleticism and physical stature, along with playmaking abilities (court vision and passing). Duncan is strictly reliant on fundamentals. His are so strong he will just beat the defense or offense with the correct and perfect basketball play. Thats his game and always has been. Duncan is just productive."
NBA2k,3c87po,Kenton1321,2,Mon Jul 6 11:56:41 2015 UTC,"That's one of the reasons I could see Duncan playing till he was almost in his mid 40s. He's so grounded in his game, and knows exactly what he can and can't do (a thing most players struggle with) that even as just a role player, maybe a 10pt, 7 reb guy, he would still be effective in ways that the stat sheet wouldn't show. And not just all that, but also the fact that he's willing to accept any role, as long as it leads to team success."
NBA2k,3c87po,ENKC,2,Mon Jul 6 16:27:41 2015 UTC,"Lebron has shown a willingness to adapt on his game and work on his weaknesses. But even if he retires at 35, will Russ or Harden be the undisputed 97+ player at that point? That was the question."

NBA2k,3c87po,jlu10,5,Tue Jul 14 19:13:23 2015 UTC,Anthony Davis.
NBA2k,3c87po,random__username,24,Tue Jul 14 19:18:25 2015 UTC,AD for sure. Maybe Damien lillard or James harden?  Edit: fuck you guys
NBA2k,3c87po,jlu10,14,Mon Jul 6 03:29:39 2015 UTC,I dont get why you're being downvoted.. You answered the question.
NBA2k,3c87po,BlueHundred,2,Sun Jul 5 23:31:38 2015 UTC,"Exactly. Like what the fuck. If lillard and harden both become much better defenders, they are easy 97's since they already produce so much on offense."
NBA2k,3c87po,jlu10,12,Mon Jul 6 02:03:09 2015 UTC,I think it was the Lillard part. There are many young PGs with talent also and he has yet to seem like a transcendent player.
NBA2k,3c87po,ZedsShadow,-4,Mon Jul 6 02:36:29 2015 UTC,But he's still so young
NBA2k,3c87po,BlueHundred,8,Mon Jul 6 10:00:35 2015 UTC,"Eh, he's young not but not that young. He's 24 going on 25 years old. Kyrie Irving fits this description though, who I think is already better than Lillard and is 23."
NBA2k,3c87po,jthagod,1 point,Mon Jul 6 10:13:59 2015 UTC,"I mean Kyrie has basically the same production while being younger. The issue with mentioning Lillard is that he's not even the best PG right now, so chances are slim on him being the dominant PG in 5-10 years."
NBA2k,3c87po,ZedsShadow,-5,Mon Jul 6 10:31:17 2015 UTC,"Kyrie has shown little to no growth in his game since his rookie year, just his scoring numbers going up because he played more minutes and has more of a green light."
NBA2k,3c87po,Battmans_Hooters,6,Tue Jul 7 14:51:43 2015 UTC,And what growth has Lillard shown?
NBA2k,3c87po,jthagod,5,Mon Jul 6 11:00:15 2015 UTC,There is no way this guy has watched Kyrie play very much. Kyrie is better on offense than Lillard and has shown he is capable to step up on defense as well and be the #1 option on his team. Kyrie is better and younger.
NBA2k,3c87po,fdylan23,1 point,Mon Jul 6 11:10:25 2015 UTC,"None, neither of them have shown any major growth. I wasn't caping for Lillard, just saying looking at Kyrie play he's the same player he was in 2011. Same applies to Lillard."
NBA2k,3c87po,carmelogoat2,1 point,Mon Jul 6 16:14:26 2015 UTC,"Agreed. Neither Kyrie or Lillard seemed to improve at transcendent levels and neither showcases good D for the most part. However, Irving is younger and has the higher chance of being better. Plus those sweet handles deserve a higher rating god damn."
NBA2k,3c87po,W360,0,Tue Jul 7 09:36:49 2015 UTC,Durant dumbass?
NBA2k,3c87po,jlu10,-6,Wed Jul 8 09:00:28 2015 UTC,but maybe not.
NBA2k,3c87po,W360,2,Sat Jul 11 02:29:03 2015 UTC,But maybe not to who? AD I feel will be there for sure in 2 years (he's hitting 3's now. The man is a beast). Lillard and harden definitely have some work to do on the defensive end if they'll get there
NBA2k,3c87po,jlu10,5,Mon Jul 6 03:24:38 2015 UTC,"AD is a good answer, but Harden or Lillard just are not going to get that highly ranked. They are very very good, but for lack of better words you have to be very very very good."
NBA2k,3c87po,MrKentucky,1 point,Mon Jul 6 04:01:27 2015 UTC,"Well LBJ is only 30, so he's got quite a few years left in the league. By then it's possible harden becomes a better defender, but probably not with him. Lillard feels like a very good possibility because of how young and talented he is already. We'll just have to wait and see"
NBA2k,3c87po,jlu10,2,Mon Jul 6 04:05:56 2015 UTC,"I don't see any way in hell Lillard is ever rated higher than Davis going forward. Also, AD is a good 3-4 years younger than Dame."
NBA2k,3c87po,BlueHundred,3,Mon Jul 6 04:16:29 2015 UTC,"Only a 2 year difference (AD 22, Lillard 24). It would take a huge leap for Lillard, but I think he could be a 97 rated player. AD however I believe will be an easy 99 for many years"
NBA2k,3c87po,chance_the_ruthless,5,Mon Jul 6 04:43:18 2015 UTC,Someone that's not ih the league yet.  Lebron has close to 10 years left. I'd say AD won't be 97+ at that point anymore. 90+ but not 97+. Unless Lebron retired early.
NBA2k,3c87po,Andyk123,3,Mon Jul 6 04:46:21 2015 UTC,You really think Lebron's gonna play to 40?
NBA2k,3c87po,TD_21,1 point,Mon Jul 6 09:57:55 2015 UTC,"If he amends his game by putting on a bunch of muscle mass and working on his post and turnaround game he could be productive into his very late 30s, like a Karl Malone or something. His passing is so good at the 3/4 he could definitely get work into his 40s if he wanted."
NBA2k,3c87po,chance_the_ruthless,3,Mon Jul 6 13:34:16 2015 UTC,I thinking adding weight and banging in the post would take a lot out of him physically. I could see him dropping weight like Duncan did and switching to a style more like Dirk does in the post with fadeaways and stuff.  Of course with the way the NBA is trending there may not be that many big bodies to have to post up so everything I'm saying might be pointless.

I think he'd retire if he regressed to anything less than #2 on the team though. But it depends on how much he wants rings and how much he wants to keep making/building his brand. Most of his money comes from endorsements and stuff. His contracts are a relatively smaller portion of his earnings. Probably between 10 and 20%, maybe less."
NBA2k,3c87po,BlueHundred,1 point,Wed Jul 8 00:15:52 2015 UTC,AD is 22 and is already a 96 from the last 2k update.
NBA2k,3c87po,W360,-1,Wed Jul 8 07:59:48 2015 UTC,"I know, but the question was after LeBron retires. AD around 30+ years old might not still be 97+. AD is gonna be 97+ from 2k16-2k20something (provided he stays healthy) but LeBron is still a long ways away from retiring"
NBA2k,3c87po,DarthJones1,2,Mon Jul 6 18:29:01 2015 UTC,"AD has the best shot. They won't give it unless it is deserved. LeBron would be a 97 in any given time period, they won't just elevate someone for the reason of because."

NBA2k,3c87po,KokomoOReily,12,Mon Jul 6 01:33:46 2015 UTC,Reggie is probably in the 87-91 range.

Big men tend to do pretty good there last few years do to how they can get over the defense easily with long bodies, strength, and arm length and steph curry is not exactly the most athletic guy In the league and definitely not even close to the strongest and James harden is hard to predict because he is athletic and his ungaurdabillity but i would have said the same if Dwayne Wayde when he was younger.

NBA2k,3c6pcf,ParamoreFanClub,4,Mon Jul 6 03:07:51 2015 UTC,"Start the game strong defensively, because if they start hitting they won't stop. On the POI before the game starts select limit perimeter shots and physical D. Then select tight defense on curry and Thompson in th defensive settings once game starts.   1st quarter: man to man, double curry every other possession, force him to go to Thompson and hopefully tire curry.   2nd quarter: 3-2 zone. Double anyone when they get to the corner 3s. If they start hitting go back to man.   3rd: back to man and doubling whoever makes the first 3 pointer, either curry or klay  4th: start with 3-2 but switch to man at the 3 min Mark and start doubling curry.   ***I play on ball defense. I switch to my opponents player and D him up myself. If you can't do that well, or if you only play off ball D, or control the Center and wait in the paint for blocks, you are probably gonna have a bad time regardless.

NBA2k,3c6v63,deepfriedfriends,5,Mon Jul 6 01:08:24 2015 UTC,"The drop-step is nigh worthless for this exact reason. My inside game is at like 16 or 17 blocks and I can't even get separation on a C- defender with Drop-Stepper. Standing layup at 90, grab an offensive board? Get shoved, no foul, clank the layup. You've got a better chance of hitting a contested mid-range jumper than you do a wide open hook shot or layup out of the post.  Next year they need to impose a harsh penalty for shooting moving threes (to help eliminate the stupid zig zag cheese), and they seriously need to call fouls more. I've been shoved, hacked, chipped at and all but thrown into the stanchion in the paint and gotten no calls, especially in MyCareer.  EDIT: As an addendum to this, the up and under is worthless for much the same reason. I can pump fake, get a guy off his feet and have a clear look at the basket for an easy bunny and just roll it out the other side of the rim. It makes trying to play an inside scoring big man an absolute nightmare."
NBA2k,3c6v63,Ethalarian,4,Tue Jul 7 00:37:13 2015 UTC,"This is the reason why everybody exclusively does post fadeaways, baseline dunks, or threes. You typically aren't rewarded for getting what should be an easy look. I hope they fix it next year."

NBA2k,3c6v63,gsano,3,Tue Jul 7 06:02:50 2015 UTC,It sucks.  Having a PG with gold dimer helps when you are talking about an assisted layup.  More than anything it's the player.  Duncan puts the ball through the hoop.

Frustrating when guards can come in and dunk on me at will. I think it has something to do with how fast they can get up to max speed and it taking longer for bigger guys to get to that max speed. But that's just a thought. I've given up assuming my guy will posterize and play accordingly: pump fakes, up and unders, pulling up for a midrange on a fast break= just as effective as the dunk in the Rec."

NBA2k,3c3ggw,Flysenberg,48,Sat Jul 4 11:48:16 2015 UTC,I actually didn't know Wilt had these skills until I saw that post in /r/nba. I guess I have to agree with the rating now but the other Wilts don't have ratings anywhere near 85 mid and 90+ fade.
NBA2k,3c3ggw,AfroBraids,31,Sat Jul 4 14:59:30 2015 UTC,"The Lakers Wilts got underrated pretty heavily. For example he was known in LA as being primarily a defender and was notorious for swatting shots into the stands yet only was given a 92 block rating. He played 44 minutes per game in 1971 and 42 minutes in 1972 yet was only given a 97 stamina rating. For comparison, Kevin Durant has never played over 40 minutes per game in his entire career yet was given a 99 stamina rating.   His post fadeaway on the Lakers card is only at a 60, and I think in 2K16 it should be at least an 80. Wilt was much better offensively than 2K has given him credit for."

To me he looks like a player who uses his extraordinary wingspan and height to block shots, not ultra quick feet.  If wilt's ratings were real life there would be no question as to GOAT.  The 99 vert, I'll give 2k a break on, because so many players already have 99 reb and 99 blk, and they wanted him to play like wilt so they had to overrate this stat.  It's unrealistic as shit.  I just played a guy with wilt and, trust me, it did not look like the video.  It looked like a guard facing up and sprinting for a fadeaway mid range ala MJ. Wilt having a 98 post fade does not bother me, clearly it's a consistent shot.  I'd say his quickness should be in the high 60s with a speed around 85.  His moving mid should be nerfed and his standing mid should be a 82.  That seems more realistic IMO.  Edit: LOL at the mass downvotes in this thread... read the reddiquette!  Downvotes are for comments that do not add to the conversation.  If you do not like what I have to say, comment below and tell me I'm an idiot.  I won't be hurt."
NBA2k,3c3ggw,TheRealClutch18,5,Sat Jul 4 23:52:53 2015 UTC,"From a gameplay perspective, your points make no sense. I'll go through point by point.    He has a high lateral quickness because of gameplay, not reflective of real life. If his lateral quickness was in the 60s he'd be beat off the dribble to the rim almost every time and scored on with ease. He doesn't have the length of Yao Ming so he can't get away with low lateral quickness. Wilt would probably be the all-time block leader by a landslide if they recorded blocks back then so they want to have him be a threat on defense. Wilt was rumored to be able to touch the top of the backboard and there are numerous clips of him skying way above the rim to block shots. That is where the 98 vert came from. He was also a Big 7 high jump champion in college. Wilt was a complete freak athlete way ahead of his time. Not overrated in this area at all. Moving his standing mid from an 85 to an 82? Not really a significant difference whatsoever...I think you kinda just want Wilt's ratings lowered for the sake of it. I agree his moving mid is too high but you seem to not know entirely what you're talking about."
NBA2k,3c3ggw,DRidder17,1 point,Sun Jul 5 01:50:01 2015 UTC,"TBH I think he could have used better defensive stats.  I think his overall is fine.  I'm not entirely disagreeing with you.  With guys like Ruby blake in the game, with 99 speed, 99vert, 99 quickness, it kind of sets the bar.  Though other bigs have set a sort of precedent, wilts collection of stats allow him to do everything at an elite level.  High quickness and speed stats mean he can dribble at guard like speeds with guard like change of direction in gameplay.   Wilt is a guy with touch, but mid range is all the way out to the 3pt line.  Wilt was not shooting from far away because he did not have to.  Moving mid in the game is what guys like kobe shoot.  Wilt does not shoot that shot.  Guys who are known as shooters have standing mid range around 90.  Aside from that, the physicality of basketball was different then, and though Wilt undoubtedly changed the game, he was competing in a less athletic league.  I believe wilt was a supreme athlete, but comparing him to today's athletes is very hard.  Trying to place a player outside his era is difficult, but that's what 2k is trying to do with myteam, so of course there will be flaws in the ratings."
NBA2k,3c3ggw,senorstronnk,2,Mon Jul 6 02:34:12 2015 UTC,"Which calls for 2K to include more specific stats in this game. Wilt was indeed a player worthy of 94 speed but I agree that he shouldn't be running the ball up the floor that fast. They should have off ball speed and speed with the ball attributes. Wilt should be capable of beating almost any center up the floor with ease as that's how fast he could run the break when he played.   Post fadeaways also extend all the way out to the three point line. The mid range isn't specifically overrated for nothing. This is a flaw once again in 2K's attribute system rather than overrating Wilt. They need to add an attribute for deep mid range shots. Moving mid range is indeed what guys like Kobe shoot but Wilt also shot moving mid range shots around the free throw line after facing up in the high post. The moving mid is open to interpretation but I just view it as a mid range shot on the move which is how it is described, not exclusively a running fadeaway like MJ or Kobe.  Comparing Wilt to today's athletes is not hard at all. There is many specific athletic feats that he was said to have accomplished and also footage of him accomplishing that many modern players haven't come close to. You can argue against his competition which is completely fair but I think Wilt is one of those athletes you move into any era of NBA history and he's the most dominant big man in it. Look what Shaq was able to do mostly with his sheer size and strength, then imagine someone faster, more athletic and with a lot more gas in the tank."
NBA2k,3c3ggw,Baked_Bt,1 point,Mon Jul 6 04:08:06 2015 UTC,"All good points.  I think we are on the same page for the most part.    Unfortunately, Moving mid determines how well a player hits a non spot up jumper as well as a running fadeaway like MJ.  It's the same shot in 2k, lol.  So back to your point about more rating categories.  Wilt's speed makes the 99 speed ruby dunkers seem slower.  Those guys are supposed to be speed demons, but there is only a slight difference.  It's interesting that Wilt is essentially rated with those players in mind.  In that sense it's fair as wilt is a supreme rim protector and this is a nba jam style game.  IMO shaq is stronger than wilt.  The guy has weight on wilt.  Shaq was 400lbs late in his career, where wilt was ""only"" 300lbs.  That said, wilt could probably stop shaq with his length and still excellent strength."
NBA2k,3c3ggw,NeoDedalus,1 point,Mon Jul 6 04:42:59 2015 UTC,"I agree with your points there completely.   As for Shaq being stronger than Wilt tho I disagree. Just because Shaq was heavier doesn't mean he was stronger, also comparing a Shaq late in his career where he was no longer a very productive player to a Wilt that wasn't out of his prime is an unfair comparison. Wilt in LA was about 315lbs and Shaq in his prime was about 330lbs. Not a huge difference and also factor in that Shaq was known for being fat and not committed to being in game shape which is why he got gassed quickly. Wilt was pure muscle which is why he could sustain his bulked up body for over 40 minutes per game for the second half of his career. Wilt could very well have been stronger than Shaq despite not being as heavy, but we'll never know for sure."
NBA2k,3c3ggw,MafiaKilla36,1 point,Mon Jul 6 05:04:27 2015 UTC,"Good points.  I would think shaq's more solid base would give him the edge in strength.  Shaq's center of gravity is influenced by his massive ass, lol.    Wilt seems like they type of player who could succeed in any era, IMO. Hard to rate him, especially when they are taking into account every other player in Myteam.  Guys like Ruby Dikembe, Eraser's Hakeem, Onyx Dwight, (even Daryl Dawkins) all have high stats that set the bar for Wilt.  In the purest sense, Wilt is a bit overrated in some categories (underrated in others).  In the context of myteam, he's a guy who is right where he should be if not a bit underrated.  I'd take some stats from the offensive side and apply it to defense IMO, but im not a myteam developer.  Here's where my idea falls apart though, A Wilt who can shoot running fade aways is someone who people buy VC to get.  A wilt with less offense is not as desirable, and he's not going to inspire as many people to dump money into pack openings.  Being one of the last players to come out, he has to be a great player.  The guys who spend a grand on VC are going to need a reason to put another $100 bucks into VC.  They already have great players, so they can only be enticed by really, really good cards.  Plus, people gotta have the new shit when it comes out, be it the new iphone or the new video game DLC."

NBA2k,3c3ggw,Celticsfor18th,-2,Sat Jul 4 13:43:32 2015 UTC,"Running is not the same as a full speed dribble, and it never has been.  2k has rated Wilt such that he can dribble down the floor faster than many guards can run with or without the ball.  Wilt dribbles the length of the floor at the same speed as Kemba, who also has 94 speed.  You realize this, right?"
NBA2k,3c3ggw,BlueHundred,1 point,Sun Jul 5 00:45:54 2015 UTC,"Well fine but then why are some of the fastest players in the league also the fastest with the ball? Also if you find clips of wilt dribbling, the rules on dribbling were different back then and it really hindered the speed bugs could dribble. Bill Russell clips are the same way.  2x also. If wilt dribbles the ball up the court, just take a good stealer and steal it. Unless he has really good ball-handling it should work. Obviously don't overdo it and foul though."
NBA2k,3c3ggw,Raider6601,1 point,Sun Jul 5 00:56:42 2015 UTC,"Fair point, there is not a full speed dribble stat.  Maybe they should implement it?  IMO wilt on the break could be a 94, that's not crazy."
