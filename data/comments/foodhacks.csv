Turn the half inside out. Use your knife to trim out the cubes of mango flesh. Cut of remain mango skin from around seed. Fillet off remaining fruit.

foodhacks,3d100w,Ugsley,5,Mon Jul 13 06:39:04 2015 UTC,"Two things. I couldn't see any posts here that tell you the correct way to season a cast iron frypan, skillet, pot, or dutch oven, or a steel wok.   This applies whether you bought it new, got it second-hand and pre-used, or dragged it in from the back yard rusty and spent time getting rid of the rust.  First you have to put it on the flame and get it HOT! Blue hot is best.  This drives out all the moisture from it's porosities, and burns off a lot of dirty residue.  After you remove it from the heat, get a rag and some good cooking oil or lard. You can use a fragrant oil like sesame oil, but it doesn't matter,  if seasoning the pan with fragrances makes any difference, you'll be imparting flavours soon from the food you'll be cooking. Wipe the pan ALL OVER with the oil. Inside, outside, handle, everywhere.  Let it cool.  Now you have the rust-resistant non-stick finish that's good to cook with, you can easily wash it clean, don't scour unnecessarily,  and you will only need to repeat the process rarely as needed.   The second thing I wanted to mention. You said you have ""a cast iron""!!! WTF is that?  That's like saying I have a plastic, or I have an aluminium, or I have a wood! When you say, ""I have a cast iron"", we don't know if you're talking about an engine cylinder block, a decorative Victorian verandah ornament, a slurry pump, or a piece of cookware! A cast iron WHAT?"
foodhacks,3d100w,Ugsley,4,Mon Jul 13 06:55:46 2015 UTC,"What temp' would you consider to be hot enough with an oven? The temps' I find seem to vary.  You caught me, it's an engine cylinder block. You're a sly dog. You, I like you."
foodhacks,3d100w,Quasifrodo,1 point,Mon Jul 13 11:09:41 2015 UTC,"I don't think you'll get it hot enough in a conventional kitchen oven, even a commercial oven.  It depends what your ""cast iron"" actually is.  If it's a frypan, a dutch oven, or a pot, then you should be doing it over a flame, like a gas flame, because it's the base you need to treat properly, and you leave it on full heat until you see the blueish colour, and when as much of the base as practicable has turned blueish, then off the flame, and wipe with oil while still hot.  If it's an enamelled cast iron casserole dish or frypan, then these instructions don't apply because the surface is already treated with the enamel.  If the oven is all you've got, then just get the temperature high as you can, then remove from the heat and oil it, it's better than nothing, but best results come from bringing the steel up to blue heat, and the cast iron up to the same temperature.  You can see the colour much better in steel like a wok, it's very bright and easy to distinguish the different shades. In the cast iron it looks more grey at that heat but you can still see it, and as it's coming up to temperature you see all the vapours and dirt being burned out of it."

Make any difference with these facts tossed in?"
foodhacks,3d100w,Ugsley,2,Mon Jul 13 14:20:28 2015 UTC,The best way to strip it is to throw it into your oven for a full self-cleaning cycle... it gets far above standard cooking temps and will burn off all coatings down to a nice dull gray.

foodhacks,3d100w,sapiophile,2,Mon Jul 13 16:56:35 2015 UTC,"No, just to strip it.   Once seasoned, I just very lightly oil the inside after every use and briefly bring it up to temp on a burner. When the sheen goes from glossy to matte, I turn it off, let it cool, then quickly give it a final buff with a paper towel that has a hint of oil before storing."
foodhacks,3d100w,whittler,2,Mon Jul 13 18:45:14 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the help/tips/advice  hugs and pet my sweet, sweet new baby"
foodhacks,3d100w,aManPerson,2,Mon Jul 13 22:28:35 2015 UTC,"Looks like a nice frypan! Looks well made.  I see comments about oven self cleaning cycles. I have never heard of those ovens or those cycles, so I don't know what they do, but it's hard to beat the heat you get from the naked flame applied directly to the steel or cast iron. If you've got a good flame you can make a frypan red hot which you can't do in an oven unless it's a forge. You don't want it red hot, but you do want to get it hot, VERY, VERY hot. When you get it hot enough and then oil it, you're also tempering the cast iron somewhat, which increases its durability and rust resistance. You don't have to do that often, but initially, and then afterwards rarely, only as needed. That pan you've bought looks like it's a better quality casting and probably better quality cast iron than I usually see, so maybe you won't need to do the proper prior preparation, but if it was mine, I would. The best piece of cast iron I've got is a big oven roasting pan made by Kockums of Sweden, who make the nuclear submarines. It's denser and heavier than any of my other cast iron cookware, and the only reasons I don't season or temper it are, (a). it's enameled everywhere except the external base, and (b). it's such high quality cast iron, it's virtually impervious to rust in normal use anyway. Anyway, whatever you do with it, enjoy it!"
foodhacks,3d100w,6F6A9O9,7,Thu Jul 16 14:56:16 2015 UTC,"you can season the bottom, but it will get burned off.  the seasoning you add by burning oil on there, it burns off at like 800F or something.  the bottom of your pan will be in direct contact with the flames from your stove top.  it'll surely get destroyed if you use it a few times.  but it wont hurt it."
foodhacks,3d100w,meekstadt,3,Sun Jul 12 17:06:56 2015 UTC,"So it's not a must to season the bottom then?  I'm just curious about what bits of it I should season exactly I suppose. Like should I just do the whole thing (is that the standard?), or would I only need to do the inside bit?  (Thanks for the quick reply by the way)"
foodhacks,3d100w,robmox,9,Sun Jul 12 17:21:02 2015 UTC,"No, it's not a must, but I would do it the first time, for a new pan.  Seasoning cast iron performs two roles:   Create a slick, non-stick surface on the areas where food will contact the pan, and Create a durable coating that will protect the iron from rust and other damage.   The reasons to season the bottom, or ""outside"" of the pan are related to #2. For that reason, you can be a lot more lax in how you season the outside, but it's still good to do, at least occasionally.  Also, come check out /r/castiron for serious cast iron discussions."

The breakdown an rust removal is absolutely essential.  I'm on coat 6 of my expensive and time consuming coats of flaxseed, and my friends Dutch ovens are looking great. I preheat to 450 for a half hour, then an hour or two later, I start seasoning. I season everything, wiping it everywhere and then I do a complete wipe down before I put it in, then another 2 wipedowns 5 minutes apart after putting them in the 500 oven. The super thin coat is the secret. This heat is turned off after an hour and a half, but the peices stay in oven.  If you have an already seasoned pan, the process is same.  2 coats of super thin Crisco are great. Preheat to 450, apply liberally, wipe down 3 times. I will finish with Crisco for coats 9 and 10 after my flaxseed. Pots will be black as pitch and non stick."
foodhacks,3d100w,meekstadt,2,Sun Jul 12 21:39:25 2015 UTC,"Shit, sweet. Thanks for all this.  I was actually wondering about oils vs crisco.  Some people say fat is the way to go, some people say oil is."
foodhacks,3d100w,lightsource1808,3,Sun Jul 12 21:44:21 2015 UTC,"doing the whole thing is fine.  it's just going to burn off the bottom.  you do the seasoning for 2 reasons:   to coat the raw iron so it won't slowly rust over time. as the oil breaks down it forms a polymer, a plastic like covering.  this is the non stick.   by the way, different oils form different polymers when broken down.  some are harder polymers than others.  flax seed oil seems to form the hardest polymer.  so try to use that if you can.  when i first got mine, i was so worried about putting a good pantina on it.  the first few cooks maybe had a little odd sticking.  after that, just making sure i had oil in there and getting the pan hot enough to smoke while cooking seemed to really bake in a good seal.  if i get some dried chunks in there, i rinse it out every few weeks, otherwise i let it be."
foodhacks,3d100w,ive_lost_my_keys,3,Sun Jul 12 18:54:10 2015 UTC,The seasoning of the pan is to give it a nonstick like surface. There's absolutely no need to season the external side of the bottom of your skillet. The way to keep them from rusting is to hand dry them after each use. Occasionally swipe a lightly oiled paper towel around on the inside then dry it out. It's not as complicated as people try to make it sound.
foodhacks,3d100w,lightsource1808,2,Mon Jul 13 04:35:15 2015 UTC,"Seasoning is just how you get cast iron to be ""nonstick"" so you only need it on the inside."
foodhacks,3d100w,red_byrd,3,Sun Jul 12 17:32:41 2015 UTC,"If I season it and stuff still sticks, what am I doing wrong?"
foodhacks,3d100w,trancematik,4,Sun Jul 12 17:42:40 2015 UTC,"You want to make sure that you don't damage the seasoning in any way (by using soap or putting acidic things in the pan), but you probably know that. Mostly it's just that seasoning develops over time. Doing the initial seasoning in the oven as seriouseats suggests is a good start, but the more you use the pan the more durable and nonstick the seasoning becomes.  What I do is I just leave the cast-iron pan on the stove and use it whenever I'm making something suitable (like bacon, burgers, steak, or grilled cheese). Afterwards, I give it a good rinse in the sink and scrape off any food bits with a plastic scraper (no soap). Then I dry it thoroughly with paper towels and, if I think I won't be using the pan for a while, I'll give it a wipe down with a tiny amount of vegetable oil just to keep it safe from moisture (probably not necessary but its fun to me). After a few weeks of this it should start developing that dark black shine and it'll be nonstick enough to cook eggs on. YMMV"
foodhacks,3d100w,TychoBass,3,Sun Jul 12 18:01:52 2015 UTC,Actually it's your number one rust inhibitor as well as non stick so you should certainly season every inch.

foodhacks,3d100w,ainsley27,4,Sun Jul 12 19:27:16 2015 UTC,"As another user posted, I usually wipe it down inside with a paper towel, then put it back on the burner to make sure all of the water is evaporated.   Maybe once a week I'll wipe out the inside with a bit of olive oil and a paper towel, and I usually wipe it out before cooking anyway because of the dust - I leave mine on the stove all the time."

foodhacks,3d100w,emmastout,4,Sun Jul 12 20:02:50 2015 UTC,"I think it's worth mentioning that on a pan in normal kitchen use, any rust will be superficial. It's not like it's going to be kept outside in the rainforest, the worst that can happen is that you didn't get it totally dry before you put it in the cabinet to store it. Obviously, you don't want that inside the pan, but some rust spots on the outside just rub off and won't hurt anything. It's not as if it will disintegrate as soon as it touches water. Worrying about seasoning the bottom like the top is just unnecessary and wasteful.  Remember, people have used cast iron pans for hundreds of years without any thought to this stuff, so there's very little you can do to screw it up.  Source: My grandfather uses cast iron pans everyday, washes them in hot, soapy water, scrubs them with steel wool, and you can still slide an egg off them like glass."
foodhacks,3d100w,emmastout,0,Sun Jul 12 20:48:39 2015 UTC,"That's because even he knew to grease them well to certain point and still cooks very fatty foods on them. Don't believe they just got perfectly, evenly black all on their own without any maintenance from him. If you don't regularly oil them, you're asking for trouble.  I do all those things he does, but it took the pan sometime to get to that stage to not see the original cast iron colour."

foodhacks,3d100w,emmastout,6,Sun Jul 12 18:04:49 2015 UTC,Don't bother wiping it really really dry. Wipe it dry and then put it empty on the stove over moderate heat for a couple of minutes. This will get it much dryer than any amount of wiping.

foodhacks,3beyp3,SeattleAlex,1 point,Mon Jun 29 04:16:21 2015 UTC,"None for me. But I make sure the dough chills overnight and then stays cold. I take the bowl out to scoop onto the sheet and then put it back in the fridge between batches. But I used the basic Toll House recipe and then made changes for the kind of cookies I wanted according to his experiments. Like half brown and half white sugar, creamed butter (not melted) and long chill time. I scooped them out with a spoon in blobs rather than making a log and cutting as well. When making shortbread cooking, I even chill the pans to keep them from spreading. It seems to help. If I feel like the pan has gotten close to room temp while I was cutting the dough, I'll put the pan with the cookies on it in the freezer for a few minutes before baking.  Edit- also, using half butter and half shortening helped a lot, I think."

Its natural. You get the juice straight from the fruit. No preservatives, no processing, no can that got shipped from Thailand and then goes straight into the trash.   On the other hand, you're pretty lucky if you get a whole can of coconut water out of a coconut. And then you have a dilemma. What the fuck do you do with all that coconut? What if you like having coconut water every day?   Either you're buried in coconut, or you dead (if you ate that much coconut). A coconut has about 1500 calories, most of which is saturated fat, IIRC."

Coconut cream and milk (which are two different things), are both made by boiling shredded coconut meat (nothing to do with coconut water) with regular water. Coconut milk obviously has a milk like consistency and is made in my experience by boiling or simmering one part shredded coconut with one part water. Coconut cream is made by boiling or simmering three or four parts shredded coconut with water, it's creamy obviously. Neither of those things which I've grown up using and making, have anything to do with the sometimes non existent, or rancid water that remains in an aged coconut.

foodhacks,3bb0th,garaging,5,Sun Jun 28 06:21:23 2015 UTC,I guess you all have a slightly used jar of turmeric at the back of the cupboard.  Do not go and buy a fresh jar for this tip.  Turmeric is like paprika in that it loses its flavour very soon after opening but it has a strong flavour to begin with.  That said... a little turmeric would probably be quite yummy in lemon cookies or cakes.  I'd probably add some cardamom too.  :)

As long as it's dry and not moldy or anything, turmeric will hold it's colour forever pretty much.   But I would advise not adding cardamom to a standard lemon recipe that doesn't call for it. Even a few grains of cardamom will completely change the flavour profile of the dish. It's much more over-powering than turmeric."

After about 10 minutes of baking,(15 for stuffed pizzas like the one in the picture) slide the pizza off the white baking tray provided right onto the rack of the oven. This allows the bottom crust to crisp up over the last five minutes of baking.   At the store we have ""shakers"" red pepper flakes, Parma cheese, herb and spice blend. That shits free, tell the pizza artist to cover the pizza in all three. They are good.   No charge for extra sauce so have them mix and match the sauces to create new blends. Pizza is all about the sauce.  You can sub item for item at no cost. Get a Chicago stuffed. Has a lot of ingredients, 10 bucks on tuesdays.

foodhacks,3azj6p,daileyjd,1 point,Thu Jun 25 17:52:31 2015 UTC,"That's the greatness of sous vide cooking.  The water temperature is whatever you want the final temperature of the meat to be.  So for a medium-rare steak, around 135F.  You set the water to that temperature, and by the laws of physics, the steak can't get any hotter than that, so you guarantee that it won't overcook.  The bag can easily take that kind of heat."
foodhacks,3azj6p,scottevil110,8,Fri Jun 26 03:16:02 2015 UTC,Cooking a steak sous vide style to about 10 degrees under your target temp and then searing it on the hottest cooking surface you can find will make an amazing steak.
foodhacks,3azj6p,secretcurse,42,Wed Jun 24 20:25:42 2015 UTC,"Ditto on the NOPE on this, especially if you prefer your steak at a barely-safe temperature*.  Searing should not raise the internal temperature of the steak that much.  Cook your steak fully to the desired temperature you want it when.  Just let your steak rest a little before searing to cool it.  Then sear.  EDIT:  Seriously, guys, and I'm saying this for your own benefit, 10 degrees Fahrenheit is likely too big of a difference and you might be messing with your desired rarity.  And that's only if you're doing a ""long sear"".  If you get different results, let me know, but I get a feeling you're over-searing your steaks.  (Which might be delicious for all I know, and I may want to try it :)    * - Seems like cooking sous vide is entirely safe!  Let me rephrase... you at least don't want to undercook it.  If you're confident that you're getting the desired temperature, that's great!  Use a meat thermometer, though.  Stay safe, and verify your results.  (And maybe post them on Reddit?)

If your pan is too cold when you add the steak,  you will cook it a bit trying to get a good sear on each side - - you also have to account for around 5 degrees F of carry over cooking after the sear.   I also wouldn't worry too much about cooking something sous vide/by poaching less than 4 hours in the danger zone before searing. You have a 4 hour window before microbial growth is substantive."

foodhacks,3azj6p,secretcurse,8,Wed Jun 24 22:11:15 2015 UTC,"OK, here's your answer. The whole point of sous vide is that you cook it to the desired core temp then a surface-level sear super hot that should not penetrate to the core of the meat.   You do not cook a steak target 130 to 120. That makes absolutely no sense. If you use a blowtorch or searzall to finish, and you're not raising the temp of the middle of a 2"" thick steak with a propane torch in the time it takes to sear. If you're using a pan or a grill, and you're raising the core temp that much, cooking sous vide is pointless anway.. it's just a shitty par-cooking alternative. If you've done any sous vide cooking this is painfully obvious, hardly worth addressing with more than a word.   If any of these respected sources on sous vide steak cookery have any mention of cooking 10 degrees cooler, please point it out for me:    http://www.seriouseats.com/2015/06/food-lab-complete-guide-to-sous-vide-steak.html http://www.modernistcookingmadeeasy.com/info/modernist-techniques/more/sous-vide-cooking-technique / https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdULY3P1hAI http://www.douglasbaldwin.com/Baldwin-IJGFS-Preprint.pdf / https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QJ1T6JM8QKE http://www.chefsteps.com/activities/sous-vide-steak / http://www.chefsteps.com/activities/sous-vide-time-and-temperature-guide   Check out /r/sousvide for actual reliable info on sous vide cooking, and don't cook your chicken to 135 F thinking it'll be 145 one day."

I said that cooking a steak in a sous vide cooker to 10 degrees under the target temp and then searing it on the hottest cooking surface available would make an amazing steak.  If you're searing on a 600+ degree cooking surface for around a minute per side and you're starting with a steak that is about 10 degrees cooler than your target temperature your steak will hit its target temp and have an amazing crust on both sides.    Nobody suggested serving food ""10 degrees under target temp.""  You should probably work on your reading comprehension."

The intent is to cook the item evenly, ensuring that the inside is properly cooked without overcooking the outside, and retain moisture.
