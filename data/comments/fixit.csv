You're just trying to lift it a bit so it drops back down in a better position. Also gives a chance for a bit of sand or such to get pushed out. If you have to replace the valve then you turn it off, run a tank of cool water thru it to cool it off. If it's a side mount relief valve drain the water lower then the valve to prevent mess."

If it were mine I'd measure the water temp at the water heater drain, then get a pressure guage and get a pressure reading on your system. If the temp is OK and the pressure is OK, then I'd be replacing parts.

fixit,3e2ubh,Peanut_The_Great,4,Tue Jul 21 17:02:21 2015 UTC,Loose wire ?  When you insert a regular bulb the heat generated by the resistance between the loose wire and screw (if its on the switch or light socket) causes it to heat up slowly till the expansion causes the circuit to break.. once cool and contracted it returns to a closed loop.. The CFL using less power allows more to flow through the loose connection heating it faster..  Only thing I could think be the issue..

fixit,3e2uru,chrisfarley84,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:48:47 2015 UTC,This is your answer.  The one you have isn't worth repairing.  Think of chairs like shoes.  You either buy cheap ones that get replaced often or buy nice expensive ones that will last a decade or more. Use Craigslist and buy a good one. The HM aeron or SC leap chairs are great. You should be able to shop around and pick one up for $300-$400. Ask the seller for the date on the manufacturer  tag underneath  the chair. Most chairs have 10+ yr warranties.  You can then rely on your local dealer  to replace parts for cheap or free within that time frame.
fixit,3e2uru,sheepdog69,2,Tue Jul 21 18:59:41 2015 UTC,"Usually they will fail because the seals are bad.  Replacing them should fix it.

There's enough tension to maim or kill you in one spring and it's not worth it unless you know what you're doing and have the right tools. Also, call around and get quotes and do your research.

fixit,3dzode,PortalForChange,3,Mon Jul 20 20:53:05 2015 UTC,Does it go all the way down if you push it down then pop back up?  Every time I've seen one of these tables at some one's house they do that unless there's a bit of weight on the table.  It's just an issue of balance between the spring and the weight of the table top.  It doesn't look like there's any adjustability to that mechanism so you'd have to modify the spring to make it a little weaker.  You could stretch it a bit or heat a section.  Maybe you could screw something with a bit of weight to the bottom too.

If you take off that wooden panel you'll find pumps, a heater element, maybe a few other accessories, and the main control panel for the tub (most of the time it's a metal box with wires running into/out of it and a door you can open). Inside that door should be manufacturer info, serial numbers, wiring diagrams, a circuit board, etc. You should be able to look up your model based on those numbers.

Seal off the doors with plastic when you're doing the demolition or any sanding to prevent any travel of mold spores and dust.

fixit,3dw96v,shelfnowall,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:35:23 2015 UTC,"Short answer is yes. Long answer is yes but let me make some suggestions. But the same ones so you can attach them to each other for extra support. Buy ones with deeper shelves to create more stability. Find other ways of attaching them rather than into the walls. I'm guessing the issue is either you are in a rental or don't want to drill into concrete or brick walls. Instead you could hang super boards from the joists. You could even use wire for this provided you can make it taught. Be sure to check if the floor is level from the corner. Many poured basements have a raised edge or a down slope towards the center drain. I would suggest adding to the feet of the shelf in some way. I've seen those little narrow feet dig into concrete with the shelf loaded. If joists are exposed above I would suggest looking at buying the pieces needed and building the shelves yourself. Wood shelves set into L-beams and the framework built tall enough to attach to the joists. With this you could size the shelves to fit the joists. Take a picture of the project with a banana on the shelf.    If you are only putting light items on it I might also suggest getting the plastic shelves instead, but I would not get the ones packed with legs. You can buy some cheap pvc pipe in the right width and make these to custom heights then. Gluing the legs in adds a lot of strength.   Questions?"

I like the idea of building our own eventually, but this is a rental.  I also wouldn't mind plastic shelves too much except for the fact that we'll be moving into our own place in a couple of years. I'd like to be able to buy shelves only once, and take them to our next home and install them properly and permanently... instead of buying plastic now, using them for a year and a half and then having to sell them and buy different ones."

fixit,3duidj,AndaleTheGreat,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:35:11 2015 UTC,True.  I use mesh tape so that happens as I tape anyway.  With normal tape it should be mudded underneath first

Recently I worked with the flat tape run thru a mud box... fast, efficient and quite messy. The reason for the gouge is specifically to prevent a thin layer of mud on the surface without enough contact to hold in place.  Small cracks are often harder to make smooth if taped. Holes? Well they're just always a pain."

fixit,3dsir7,urist81,1 point,Sun Jul 19 04:26:44 2015 UTC,"Sewing leather isn't fun. You need a good machine and a heavy needle to do it. You could try by hand and re-using the existing thread holes. But however you go, you'd need to remove the existing stitch without scratching up the leather which could be difficult. Plus, looking at the piping at the seam, I think it would be difficult to get a seam ripper in there at all without causing all sorts of damage.  You could try a tailor/seamstress. They're surprisingly affordable. That, or since it's leather, perhaps an upholstery shop. They'll have heavy duty equipment that can handle stitching in leather.   However you wind up fixing it, get a packet of Loctite blue or similar threadlocker. It's like a glue for screws that will prevent this from happening again. Any auto parts store will have it. It just takes a tiny dab on the screw.  You could use red or blue, but those lock so tight you need a torch to heat it up if you ever want to take the screw out again. Not a problem on a car's suspension bolts, but definitely an issue with a bag! Blue will suffice to keep them in place and you can remove it with a screwdriver, if you turn the screwdriver hard enough for the first 1/2 turn."

fixit,3dh1vr,firematt422,3,Fri Jul 17 01:33:10 2015 UTC,"Spray paint is actually your best bet. It's not a fun project IMO, and it takes a long time to do correctly, but once the prep is done it's pretty much downhill from there.   Materials:  Sand paper: 100-120grit and 400grit  Newspaper or old tshirt  Clotheshangers or heavy gauge wire  Masking tape  Spray paint (probably two cans more than you originally think, unfortunately for you, yours is pink)    First, you need to sand the whole thing semi lightly. You don't have to remove all the previous paint, but it needs to be uniform and a little bit rough. Like 100-120 grit rough. This is the worst part IMO. It's probably going to be easier if you can disassemble it. This will also help with the painting.  After sanding, dust it off with an old tshirt or hand towel and mask off anything you don't want to be pink.   If you have the ability, life will be much easier if you can hang the workpieces from the ceiling using the coathangers or wire. This way you can paint all sides at the same time, cutting your time in half at least.   Once it is sanded, dusted and masked, you can paint. I have found that 3 coats is usually the right amount. You will definitely need at least 2. If you think you got it in one, you went too thick and you're going to have paint runs. Also, don't skimp on the paint. Store brand will not be as good. It's not worth the $10 or $15 you will save on the project.   Many of the quality paints will dry enough for the next coat in 15-30 minutes , so don't go too thick (read the label, they don't write that stuff for their health). I use the recipe: coat of paint, nice slow bottle of beer, repeat.   Finally, there are a few simple tricks to a good quality spray paint job.   Again, don't go too thick at once. This cannot be stressed enough. Keep the nozzle 8-10 inches from the surface you are painting, which most people know. But, what you have to pay attention to is maintaining  that distance throughout your entire stroke. If you hold your arm out straight and swing it side to side it makes an arc, not a straight line. This will cause more paint in the center of your stroke than at either end, which makes for runs and an uneven look. Also move at a steady pace. If unsure of pace, a little too fast is better than too slow. You'll get the hang of it. Plan your stroke. Try to go in a direction that allows you to start and stop the stroke past the edges of the workpiece. Start spraying about 4-6"" from the edge and continue past the end of the other edge the same distance. This prevents making a puddle and keeps things constant and even. Just like golf, follow through. In addition to point #3, plan a stroke that can be fully completed. Avoid stopping in the middle of the workpiece. If you do get a run, don't freak out. In my experience, the best way to handle it is to let it dry and sand it back flat with 320grit or higher. That is, unless it is a really big puddle or drip, then you should wipe it off with a cloth that won't leave behind dust (newspaper, or an old tshirt) and sand that area flat with 320+ grit once dry if necessary (it probably will be).    Godspeed."

fixit,3dh1vr,icaruscoil,2,Fri Jul 17 01:36:03 2015 UTC,"My suggestion is to use a different color primer for extra depth. So for a pink bed, I'd probably use a red primer. Paint it red. Let it dry. Paint it pink. Take your time and avoid drips or runs.   Let it dry. Use a very fine steel wool and cut down any uneveness. Add another coat of pink. Give it another sanding. I like to cut the paint down and expose the red primer on the ridges. This will give it a professional depth and look great.   Finally, if you want a glossy finish, add a coat of poly and another sanding. Otherwise, you are finished."

I would recommend putting some insulting material like a rubber sheet on the inside of the new or patched cover to prevent this happening again.

fixit,3df6ib,KingsNobleScientist,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:56:12 2015 UTC,"You'll probably have to have a commercial roofer do it. Residential contractors typically don't have to deal with flat roofs. That drives the price up.  That's a very small portion of roof, even for a residential contractor, which means the per square foot price goes up.  Do you know how old the roof is, or what kind of membrane it is? If it's newish, is it under warranty? If it's old, it may be better to reroof the whole thing.  Of course reroofing is the expensive option, especially if you do it right and remove the old roof, but if the roof is more than 15-20 years old with no warranty, it's probably the best option.  If you're handy, don't mind dealing with the chemicals to clean off the roof decking after pulling up the old membrane, and don't care about a warranty, you can probably do it yourself or with a friend over a weekend.

fixit,3demw7,Kingoliverj,12,Wed Jul 15 17:54:20 2015 UTC,I'm no electrician - but these look like breakers. If it snaps back to off - then it is breaking the circuit because of too many amps flowing through it - meaning - you have a short circuit. The cooker (stove) is bad and needs to be looked at. (Or wires leading to it.)
fixit,3demw7,SPGWhistler,6,Wed Jul 15 18:50:48 2015 UTC,"This is correct. This is not a switch, it's a protection device called a ""breaker"" that basically prevents things from overheating and catching fire. If it isn't staying on, don't force it on.  Disconnect your range (if possible) and then try to throw it back on to test the breaker itself. If it still trips back to the off position call an electrician. Otherwise you need to get your stove looked at."
fixit,3demw7,moretorquethanyou,5,Wed Jul 15 20:19:16 2015 UTC,"This is a breaker fuse, it is snapping to off because you have an electrical short somewhere. I'm guessing your cooker has died, possibly a blown element.   Try unplugging the cooker (there will be a regular plug somewhere around it, usually built into the cabinetry, alternatively there might be a switch to turn the cooker on/off). Then switch the fuse switch back on, if it stays in place with the cooker unplugged/turned off - you need a new cooker or need to replace an element, the fuse is blowing because your cooker is shorting somewhere. If the switch doesn't stay on, call an electrician as this means you have a problem elsewhere with your wiring (or some other device on that circuit, but cookers tend to have their own circuit as they draw so much)."
fixit,3demw7,col381,2,Thu Jul 16 03:10:53 2015 UTC,Probably have a short somewhere between the stove and the breaker. Check the wiring for a short. If you're not comfortable you can hire an electrician.

Hence the spinning/motor sounds but doesn't turn the auger. The auger is fine if it spins by hand.  You more than likely have a stripped drive shaft (part #30). If you pull the shaft out you'll probably see stripping away where it connects to the bin. If you go downwards, below the bin you'll see a cover with 2 screws. (Part# 33) Remove the two screws and there's the motor. If it's covered in ice, the gasket (part# 26) failed and leaked water in there causing it to crap out, which would require replacing the motor as it's rusted to hell internally. If not, pull the motor (part# 32) anyways and inspect the teeth to make sure they catch.  I'm willing to bet the gasket failed, rusted the shaft and motor at the bottom."

You might be able to force an allen wrench that's bigger than that hole in and unscrew it that way, or just use a screw extractor that's bigger than the hole.  I'm thinking someone stripped it.

fixit,3dbhk4,WHPChris,1 point,Fri Jul 17 02:11:46 2015 UTC,"It's a huge fire hazard.  First off, as mentioned, the duct run is too long.  A couple things will happen here.  One, you'll end up with a built up of lint and then A) Fire and/or B) Burning up the heating element/other parts in your dryer and C) High power/gas use because it will take longer to dry your clothes.  In addition to the above, the manufacturer and code will state the length of vent hose run AND the quantity and type of bends permitted in the vent as well as the type that need to be used.  In every state that I am aware of, plastic/paper vent pipe is not legal. At the very least, the length of the run is against code.  Duck tape is not Duct tape.  Duct tape is metal and that's what should be used to join two pieces.  Better yet, clamps and rigid pieces of actual, metal duct.  Additionally, I'm guessing that's a sewer cleanout/vent nearby.  The dryer shouldn't be near that.  Also, is that plug even rated for dryer use?  Is there a window on the same wall, that the dryer can vent out of? Can it be moved to the wall where the window is located?  I would get your facts from building/rental codes and then ask the landlord to fix the issue asap."

fixit,3d0j7h,xavier86,9,Sun Jul 12 14:10:42 2015 UTC,"I can't really tell from the video, but that drain hose needs to be above the water level of the washer when full. It looks like you have it laying on the ground. Hang it so that it's above the top of the washer and draining into that deep sink. The hose should be like this only a little bit higher.   That's how washers work. They will drain continuously unless there is enough backpressure in the drain hose to keep the tub full. After the cycle completes a small pump will kick on and drain the tub. Physics!  Edit: The levelness of the washer isn't causing your problem, but you should level it once you have it installed where you want it. Otherwise it will have poor balance and make a lot of noise during spin cycles and possibly even damage itself if the level is way off. The plastic feet are usually threaded so you can adjust the level without shims.  Edit 2: Here's a better picture for your setup. Get that drain hose goose neck at the same height as the top of that washer."

Why do you suspect the vents - are they coming into and/or out of the vents?

You might consider contacting your utility company to do a house check for energy efficiency - it sounds unrelated, but some will do this for free and they may be able to identify small air leak areas that you were unaware of.  Has anything changed in the near vicinity of your house recently - a new neighbor moving in next door, someone making significant changes to their landscaping?

In old fridges without the auto defroster, there was just a plate that got cold. Every time you open the door, moisture would come in and freeze on he cold plate. Overtime the ice buildup would be significant and you would have to chip away the ice.  New fridges occasionally warm that plate up to keep the ice from building up.  This water typically drains into a pipe to the underneath of your fridge into a small drip pan where it eventually evaporates.  Since you have water dripping inside your fridge, the pipe is probably clogged or some gravity fed ramp is misaligned.  Can you take off the plastic piece from where the water is coming from and see inside?  I am guessing it is impossible to access anything like that from the outside of the fridge, but you can try to see if you can find the drip pan and drain hose.  It may be clogged at the bottom and water filled it all the way to the top."

Is this a side by side or top/bottom freezer?  Either way, it's likely your refrig is not level with the floor, it needs to be tipped slightly back so gravity will pull the door closed. If it's been moved lately, then it just needs a re-level.  If it's a side by side, you could also have a broken door closer cam. This is very common on the bottom hinges.

I pulled the cover off the forced air unit and noted the blower fan was not turning.  The blower fan will typically require a capacitor to kick start the electric fan motor.  I replaced mine for around 12 bucks.  This is what I did, YOU SHOULD BY NO MEANS DO THIS:  A fan will run without the capacitor but it's probably not good for it.  I used a paint stick (sticking your hand in there is asking for it to get tore off or at the very least remove a couple digits) to help start the fan spinning.  Once I did that it gradually sped up and the cold air blew.  If the fan had been difficult to turn, that would indicate that it would need replaced.  I ordered the appropriate capacitor off Amazon, disconnected the rusty leaky old one and popped in a new one.

fixit,3cvrz9,Liquidretro,1 point,Sun Jul 12 00:21:53 2015 UTC,Confused here. The fan and compressor/coil are all different parts. You can run the fan independently of the compressor. Originally you said the fan wasn't working but from the post it sounds like it actually is. If it's not I agree with the capacitor could be it. From what you have posted it sounds like your coil could have been frozen. Now a frozen coil is usually a result of low refridgerant in the system from a leak. Not a DIY fix for most people. Have someone come take a look. Chances are your low by a few pounds. When on the phone with the company ask what they charge per pound of coolant. You can usually find what your system uses by looking on the unit outside or inside on the coil.

Then put some tape along the splits to keep the wood glue from seeping out before it dries. Once the glue is dry, use the white dap to go over where the cracks were to cover any paint chips and glue. This probably won't look perfect but work with it and get it as smooth as you can. Put the door knob back on and be very careful opening and closing the door."

Terrible music, but the step-by-step process showing how to disassemble the phone is excellent. If you have to remove the glass/LCD from the housing, as I did, this video shows how to do that, and also how to install the new screen/LCD into the housing. Then, when I put it all back together, I found this video to be exactly what I needed. It took about 2 hours, but that's because I was taking things slowly and watching each step several times to be sure I didn't mess anything up. Doing it again would be much faster, and the component parts of the phone are much sturdier than I thought they would be.  You'll need some kind of plastic pry tool, and a small phillips-head screwdriver similar to the kind you would use on eyeglasses. You'll also want some kind of electronics glue or double-sided tape.  I did find that my battery was glued down much more securely than it shows in the video, but by working around the edges I was able to pry it out just fine without damaging it or the phone.

fixit,3cozvn,SofaKingWeeToddDid,5,Thu Jul 9 16:47:28 2015 UTC,"You don't want to use petroleum jelly because a petroleum based product could degrade the rubber flapper and/or the rubber gaskets.  Just clean the flapper and where it seats real well.    The flapper and the part it's attached to and sits on/seals, is called the flush valve. The tall open pipe that's part of that and sticks up above the water is called the overflow tube. The part that the float is attached to, that the water comes out of, is the fill valve.    Is the water level in the tank getting high enough that it is going into the overflow tube? If so, then try adjusting the float so that the water stops filling the tank at a slightly lower level. If the water continues to run even after adjusting the float lower, then you probably need a new fill valve, only about $9 at Home Depot. If the water is not going out the top of the overflow tube, then  turn off the water behind/under the toilet, do not flush, and mark the water level with a pencil inside the tank, then check the water level in the tank every hour, marking with a pencil each time. Figure out what the level is when it finally stops leaking, when the water level hasn't changed since the last time you checked. If it goes down to the flapper or just below, then the base of the flush valve seat could be cracked/worn. If it goes below that, then the rubber gasket under the flush valve could be cracked/worn, and that could be where the water is going into the bowl from. Either way you'd need a new flush valve, also only about $9 at Home Depot.    Check those first, and if not those then one other possibility I will go into later, if needed."

If it mentions anything of a B+ voltage loss error, it's likely the IC chip MCZ3001DB.  Otherwise, there's no good way to check the inverters except for visual inspection and supply voltage checks. As with most inverters, checking anything after the transformer is not possible as the voltage is too quick to get a reading with the meter.  Just check the grounds (especially around the screws) for burn marks. It relies on ground heavily. After that, just check supply voltage to it's respective transformer.

High heat is an indicator of almost more amp draw than the cord can handle, which is not good. If the cord came with the pump, it's probably the right one to use. I would start with a check of the resistance of the cord, that'll tell you right away if there's an obvious problem. A hotspot would indicate high resistance in that spot or possible near-short (loss of insulation) situation. Whole cord heat is more indicative of wrong cord (too small/can't handle as much amperage) or the system is pulling too much power.  If you don't know if your cord can handle it, check the amperage rating of the breaker it's wired into and compare it to the cord.

If it's portable just hook it up with it's provided cord somewhere in the house and double check, without extension. If it's not and it just won't reach, see if you have a bigger (not longer) extension cord. You just might be using too small an ext. cord and it can't handle the amp draw. The provided cord is supposed to be correct, thus hooking to your home eliminates the ext. cord and will determine if it's from the ext. or the pump itself.

For every dryer I've owned it means taking off the dryer cover and vacuuming out under the lint trap, removing the hose and cleaning all the way through,and cleaning the vent on the exterior of your house. Also make sure that your dryer vent hose is not too long and isn't kinked.   Your problem sounds like it's either a thermal cutoff which you mentioned, or it may be your humidity sensor. The humidity sensor is usually inside the drum and needs to be scrubbed occasionally. You should try drying your clothes in ""timed mode""  versus ""automatic dry"" and see if that works.

The humidity sensor I do agree with, if it has poor dry on automatic then I'd try timed and see if it helps. The automatic dry is really not worth the hassle though, it's more of a gimmick than anything.

Hold the chisel as flat against the brick as you can get it to prevent deep gouges in the brick. Once you've got as much of the big stuff chipped away, wet down the brick and remaining mortar, then brush on the acid.  I don't remember the exact ratio, so ask the guy at the hardware store.  I want to say it's like 1 part in ten acid to water?  I could be wrong on that. Let the acid sit a few minutes (5-10 depending on thickness), have a beer. Using the brush try to scrape away the mortar.  Wash down the wall VERY WELL with clean water. IF needed repeat the process.

I highly recommend 2k epoxy for your DTM - it's lightyears ahead of anything else you can get. Autobodytoolmart.com and Eastwood both have 2k epoxy in a can. It costs more but it's worth it if you want to keep corrosion away.  And prep is key - you need to clean everything really well to prevent contamination that will prevent adhesion. H2O rinse, then soap and H2O on a sponge, then H2O rinse, then a rubbing alcohol rinse (isoporpol, should cost $1. Just put it on a towel and wipe down).  Next do a tack cloth to finish, and you can start your sanding.  Start with 40 grit for rough material removal, then 80 then 120 to prep for primer. Epoxy prime, then fill prime. Let the fill dry and sand 120 to 240 to 320 to 400. A primer sanded to 400 will still have enough 'tooth' for the color coat to adhere, but it's smooth enough that you'll have a nice gloss on the finish.  If it's really bad, you can use a wire wheel for rough material removal, but that would be an extra expense... And sand paper will do, it's just more time and work.  Check out NastyZ28.com - they have a bunch of members there that have painted their cars (Camaros, with a Z28 focus) and a bunch of autobody pros that post there and help out.  Oh, and if you're using rattle can you won't clear coat. That's for base/clear where the color coat doesn't have any gloss. With a single state (almost all rattle can paints are 1k single stage)."

You don't want to overdo things - it'll blend less well if your new sections are mirror-smooth, show-car glossy and the rest has the minor scratches and fading that any car will have. 400 grit followed by a final coat should give you a good smooth finish without being so over-the-top that it really stands out.  BTW, are you using single stage paint, or base/clear?

Here's their Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/hawkesauto?ref=br_rs  And with a base/clear, don't sand the base unless you mess up and run/wrinkle it. You can hang a piece of Kraft paper on the wall and spray it to get an idea of how heave you can go before you get a sag/run. If you do make a  mistake, wait for it to dry, sand out your mistake (or with runs you can shave the drop off with a razor blade before sanding smooth), then put another coat of base on to hide your sanding marks.

Belt only goes on one way and it has to go around the idler pulley else it will not have proper tension. If it is and still does not have tension, you need to replace the belt.  What you'll tend to see is the motor is turning and not gripping the belt. If the motor just isn't turning, you have a more complicated issue.  EDIT- Could also be the door switch or electronics if the dryer uses it. Frequently not elec control though. Just make sure the door switch isn't broken. Best way to check is to open the door and press the switch manually, light should go on/off with it."
fixit,3c1qgx,Etonet,3,Fri Jul 3 23:21:53 2015 UTC,"Looks like the motor that turns the fan side to side. The short answer is the motor's jamming or the wiring is breaking.  Either something broke off inside and is caught, hence turning it will dislodge it; or the wiring is losing connection and turning it barely holds it together. Both can make that sound and cause the same symptoms. If you're curious, bend and flex and twist that wire harness around while holding the motor firmly in place, that'll tell you which."

fixit,3bu6hq,neanderthalman,2,Thu Jul 2 21:16:33 2015 UTC,Vents running upwards will need a blower fan to assist in lifting the lent. I'd check the vent outside to see if it's clogged. Try the dry cycle without the vent first but I'm betting you have a clog. Another way to tell a clog is the inside of the dryer will be extremely humid on the inside. You will see moisture beeds on the tub and door. Vents going up tend to build up a ball of lent. You cut the dryer on and it lifts it a little bit adding more lint. The dryer shuts off it falls back down.

It's more than likely an obstruction at the end of the valve or the valve isn't opening properly to that specific burner. Gas flows to all the cooktop burners at once, if the flow was missing it'd be gone on all of them. The gas is there, it just won't come out. Unless of course the gas tube to it is bent/broken, but it's under the cooktop so ya know.. Extremely unlikely a tube problem.

Oddly, there is a lack of information available for this unit.  Here's a neat thing, the cooktop and the oven are wired separately. You can run one even though the other is crapped out, and vice versa. The display/clock is part of the oven side. So what we have is a cooktop issue (obviously!).  Thermal fuse is not the answer, if it were out it would stay out. Fuses typically do not reset, especially not in appliances.  What we are looking at is a problem with either one of the elements or the switches for it. I'm fairly certain (again, lack of info available) this is a unit with knobs for each of the burners. Most likely one of the bi-metals inside the switches (the part behind the knob) is defective and causing a shutdown of the whole cooktop.  Here's what you do: Check each element individually, one at a time. Turn one on, let it sit for a while and then off and try the next. If only one causes the problem, that element is most likely causing your problem. (Defective thermistor or bi-metal on element) If they ALL do it, one of your switches (the ones behind the knobs) are defective and causing a shutdown of the system. One causing the problem could indicate the switch, but not likely. Would need to physically check the switch/element for signs of malfunction.  Signs point greatly to one of your switches. Unfortunately they're wired together, and unless you know in good detail how to check them, you'll have to do it round-robin style. If it's from early 2000's the part is likely not available or comes as a set of 4-5 (all of them)."
fixit,3bszsn,WHPChris,1 point,Thu Jul 2 23:49:12 2015 UTC,Thank you for the advice.

And then we opened up the head of the stove and there were some burnt cables at some places. At this point I knew this is probably beyond my electrical knowledge and it didn't feel safe to try to spent money to try to repair this old oven and so with my room mate we decided to go get a used one because we need to eat at some point haha.  Maybe if it's really easy to fix i could fix it and re-sell the new oven we bought but I fear anyway like you said the parts for this unit will probably cost a lot since it's old.

fixit,3bpmxw,frankzzz,1 point,Wed Jul 1 12:37:19 2015 UTC,Are you using gas with ethanol in it?
fixit,3bpmxw,SarnXero,1 point,Wed Jul 1 03:30:46 2015 UTC,"Gas from the gas station. If I remember correctly around here (WA state, US) our pumps have a sticker that says up to 10% ethanol. Is that bad?"
fixit,3bpmxw,Gift_of_Intelligence,3,Wed Jul 1 03:37:38 2015 UTC,"Often lawnmowers have a plastic float that absorbs ethanol over time. When the float gets too heavy, it no longer shuts off the flow of gasoline from the tank when the fuel bowl is full. This causes flooding out. You can solve this with a new carburetor if this is the issue you are having. You can prevent this particular problem by only buying non-ethanol gasoline, separating the gas and ethanol before using it, or if you're comfortable with the lifespan of the carb, just replace it whenever it fails.  You should also check to ensure that the choke is opening correctly when the engine fires up as a stuck choke can cause similar symptoms."
fixit,3bpmxw,Gift_of_Intelligence,1 point,Wed Jul 1 03:49:48 2015 UTC,"Huh, no kidding? TIL. How would I check the choke?"
fixit,3bpmxw,Gift_of_Intelligence,2,Wed Jul 1 03:57:55 2015 UTC,"It depends a little on the lawnmower exactly. Some have a baffle that opens the choke when the fan is spinning fast enough to push enough air for the choke to open. Some simply have a cable driven choke, and some have a manual choke.  If you remove the air filter, you may be able to see the choke plate. When the engine is off, it should be closed. As soon as the engine catches, it should open all the way up. If it's stuck open (typically a broken return spring), it'll be hard to start and may not start at all without starting fluid, but once running, will run fine. If it's stuck closed (typically just gummed up or the baffle blocked by grass debris), then the mower will start but barely idle or choke out and die.  Edit: You can remove the ethanol from the gasoline by pouring one part water to nine parts gasohol (for 10% ethanol gas) into a separating funnel or any old clear glass container and shaking vigorously. Ethanol is soluble in water and gas is not. The water/ethanol solution will separate out on the bottom layer, and the pure gas will float on top. Drain off the water/ethanol or decant the gas off the top."

fixit,3bq2s9,jailin66,2,Wed Jul 1 06:04:46 2015 UTC,The outside dimension will not effect it if it's running true. There is no adjustment for the shaft of a direct drive saw or even a gear drive saw. A dropped saw can have the shaft run out. There is no fixing this if it's the issue.   Take the blade back off of the saw. Remove the blade mount closest to the motor. It should just pull off of the shaft. A bit of oil to clean this up and clean the shaft too. For that matter clean and oil all the blade mounting parts.  Wipe off excess oil and reassemble. Just get off as much oil as practical.  The blade needs to hit the blade mount perfectly flat and evenly. It's why it needs to be clean. The little bit of oil won't make a difference once you tighten the screw. Give the blade a wiggle. The shaft shouldn't have over a mm of play with the blade mounted.   Rotate the blade and look at it along it's edge. A tiny bit of wobble is ok but nothing over a couple of mm. If it wobbles when you start this so that you feel the vibration and can see wobble it is the shaft.   If you find that the shaft isn't running true remove that new blade and toss the saw. The outside dimension of the blade diameter is a standard and this blade will be usable on your next saw.   I have used saws with shafts that were off like you've described for hacking up junk wood for the camp fire. That's all they were good for. The amount of damage a cheap circular saw will run with is amazing

I'm not sure how exactly LED lights light (i.e. do they need a diffuser or not?) but older backlit flat screens (commonly referred to simply as ""LCD"") would have an opaque plastic sheet over the backlight, behind the screen. The backlight would be diffused so that you wouldn't get bright spots from bulb placement.   If the diffuser moves around at all (slides, gets hot, wrinkles), you will get an unevenly diffused light, leaving bright and/or dark spots.   The solution is to either live with it, or carefully open and inspect the inside of the TV, setting the diffuser back in place. Depending on the TV, this unfortunately is like minor surgery."

When I got to the basement, there was a switch that was taped in the up position.  It turns out, it was a 3 way switch for the stairs, and however he had it wired, both positions of the bottom switch left the light on, while the upper switch would turn it on or off.  Occasionally, when the 3 way switch at the bottom went from up to down, it would trip the circuit breaker.  My solution was to remove the bottom switch, connect two of the wires that would allow the upper 3 way switch to continue to function as a 2 way switch, cover the remaining wire with a wire nut, and then I just put a cover plate over the box.  I'll be renovating down there eventually, so when I do, that wiring will be among the first electrical repairs."

The interesting thing is that on a normal light circuit, unscrewing the bulb should have the same effect as turning the switch off, since the switch only interrupts the positive hot wire (which is why you don't want to stick your finger in light sockets even when the light is turned off). So I'm wondering if they don't have some other wire coming off of the attic switch and going somewhere it shouldn't.  Unless the problem was pretty obvious, I'd be getting an electrician in there to deal with it, because any time you have a short situation, it only takes that one time that the breaker stops working properly to set things on fire.   I'd also be looking elsewhere in the house to see if I could find other places where the previous owners decided to play DIY electrician.

What you're supposed to do is hold that black impeller with a wrench while using a socket on the screw in the middle of it. Problem is, you can't. That screw seizes in the motor shaft, and the plastic impeller just gets deformed when you apply a wrench to it. It's a design flaw on (in my experience) an otherwise great dishwasher.  The only solution is to cut through that black impeller with a hammer and chisel. I even used a tile chisel and it worked fine. The impeller has that nut part around the screw bolt. Start there and work your way to the bottom, then make a cut on the other side. It only takes a few wacks with a hammer and chisel.  Removing that plastic impeller will expose the metal motor shaft that the screw screws into. You'll be able to put a wrench on that and remove the screw.

fixit,3b1v3u,2na745,1 point,Thu Jun 25 13:46:45 2015 UTC,"Wood putty is surprisingly weak and brittle. It is for cosmetic uses only, like filling nail holes and spaces in solidly installed flooring.    Chisel out all that wood and clean the sub floor well. Sub floor construction adhesive is the proper thing to use but you could also use polyurethane construction adhesive as well if the sub floor adhesive isn't available.  It makes the wood you add all one piece with the sub floor. DO NOT get any of the construction adhesive on anything you do want it permanently. It doesn't come off and when hardened the only way to remove it is to grind it off. Wear gloves or you'll be sanding your hands. There is something to get it off when it's uncured but it sets fast. Read the tube and get a small container of the solvent.  Screw down the plywood with the adhesive and it'll never move at all. If you cut your pre-finished flooring perfectly you won't need any wood filler. But that is really only possible if you're a cabinet maker. Set the pre-finished flooring with A LITTLE sub floor construction adhesive and nails and it won't move on you. Then a day later after everything sets you can use wood filler if you like.   Nail the pre-finished flooring with a finish nail gun only. Don't try to do it by hand nailing finish nails. You'll smash the shit out of it and you. Don't have a finish nail gun? just use the adhesive and weight it down over night. The more weight the better but 25lb should do.   I can't stress enough how neat you need to be with this adhesive. Use enough to get things stuck and to fill the gaps in the sub floor. Use enough to hold the pre-finished flooring. But if it squishes out of the openings onto the finished floor it's going to look like shit and it'll be there forever. Be fussy, obsessively neat, don't rush and you'll have a floor patch that you'll be proud of.   Dry fit everything before you add any adhesive and measure twice before you cut anything. Have rags really handy when you open the tube of sub floor adhesive and open all the windows before you start. The adhesive doesn't fume all that much but if you need to open that can of solvent you'll be glad you opened the windows first.   Edit: You might be able to pull out those nails with vice-grips. Don't let the chisel edge come in contact with any metal/nails. That would destroy it."

This should get another 15 years with occasional repainting.   Replacing this isn't an easy job and all the pipe that runs through the chimney should be replaced as well as the sidewall cap if you do it. Galvanized steel in contact with mortar will rust.

Also it should be attached in such a way that sink water would not flow into it and that it would flow into the direction of the trap. So down. So lets say a y connector. Its easier than it sounds.

Think about it this way, if the hole on the wall on the left was the drain then the water would never be able to drain below that hole...which wouldn't work so it is most probably the circle on the right side.  What OP was saying is that something may not be plumbed up right so water is backflowing into the dishwasher. This is assuming that you didn't run it one day and there was water in there that didn't drain correctly - to check, just run the dishwasher and make sure all of the water drains. If the water drains, then it's probably a ""backflow"" problem. /u/otbflo gives some helpful advice below about what to look for re: backflow. Google some youtube vids on it to get a better idea.

I think it is indeed a draining problem, because I opened it up about a year ago, it was getting weird with mold but no standing water (not like this anyways...it had been sitting unused for a few years), I cleaned it, then ran a cycle I think with vinegar or something just to clean the unit. I think I did a ""set it and forget it"" and never opened it back up until today.  I did muster the courage to try and turn it on about an hour ago. It runs, but the water never came on/in. There are also some disconcerting noises.  Questions that remain: 1. Is a dishwasher just supposed to drain water i.e. if you pour water into it  while it's off, should the water just go down like a sink drain?  2. Is there a way to just disconnect the dishwasher from any water flow so it can remain undisturbed and dry in it's current/what-now-appears-to-be-broken state?  3. Since I don't think it's back flow, Would putting Draino down my kitchen sink drain help in any possible way? Maybe I need to inspect some of those tubes and see if they're clogged with mold?"

According to this: http://www.acmehowto.com/howto/appliance/dishwasher/check/heatingelement.php you should set it to ohms to test resistance, and it should then read somewhere between infinity and zero but not right on either one. and you also need to disconnect the wires from the heating element to test it.    Could be a thermostat, too.    If it's a U.S. model dishwasher, you can also try asking here in the Dishwashers forum.  Real appliance repair techs run the forums and answer the questions.  You'll need the brand and model #."
fixit,3anrda,frankzzz,1 point,Mon Jun 22 01:11:29 2015 UTC,"Yeah i set it to ohms. I didn't disconnect the wires from the heating element, and maybe that was my problem. I can easily access the heating element itself, but in order to disconnect it I have to do an intensive disassembly through the back of the washer.  I tried to measure the resistance across the heating element while still wired in. I guess if the circuit went through the electrical contacts instead of the heating element itself, then I made a worthless measurement."
fixit,3anrda,frankzzz,4,Mon Jun 22 03:07:28 2015 UTC,"Yes, with the wires still connected you'll be measuring resistance thru the wiring, too.    It doesn't have a kickplate at the bottom front, below the door, that you can remove to access the underside and the wires to the heating element?"
fixit,3anrda,classicsat,1 point,Mon Jun 22 03:54:57 2015 UTC,"A connector was loose or oxidized and burnt off, worst case.  The relay/switch/timer contact could have failed."
fixit,3anrda,WHPChris,1 point,Mon Jun 22 13:34:09 2015 UTC,"Depends how old it is and what brand, but typically they all have a thermostat/thermal fuse and a heating element with a control/timer that will send voltage to the element itself to heat it up.  To check, pull the dishwasher out and go underneath. Make sure nothing is loose or disconnected. If that's OK, disconnect wiring to the heating element (likely 2 larger wires that plug up into the tub). Check resistance across it, as long as it isn't shorted or open (infinite/megohms) you're fine.  Next, check the thermostat. It's usually a round disc shaped object wired directly in series with the heating element. Disconnect wires to it and check resistance, should read 0ohms (shorted) or extremely close to it. Anything over one or two ohms cannot be attributed to a poor meter battery.  If those check okay you will need to make sure you have proper voltage getting TO the element. Start by checking the wall outlet, which I'm sure is fine. Then check at the heating element itself when it's supposed to be heating the water (typically during the first 5-10mins of the wash cycle or at the end if heated dry is on). If it's a turn-knob timer style, advance the timer.  Either way, if you do not have voltage coming down to the element then you have a defective timer/electronic control. (Not to be confused with user interface). Timer would be difficult to get a hold of, board would not be worth replacing unless it is a very expensive unit."

fixit,3ak6q3,BigDaddyTug,1 point,Sun Jun 21 01:55:20 2015 UTC,The outlet tests fine and is connected to the bottom of the fuse box so the wires are inches long from their connection to the 220 coming into garage. This is actually attached in parallel to the two 110s in the garage and nothing else causes it to blow breakers. Should have said breaker above. The fuse box is after the plug and all of it goes to a 220 breaker in the house. Thankfully. I'd hate to have tested it several times and kept blowing fuses.    No other sockets available for 220 here.
fixit,3ak6q3,BigDaddyTug,1 point,Sun Jun 21 02:45:30 2015 UTC,"Well that narrows it down at least. How about the plug itself, in the pic there next to the switch?

You will never get the color to match 100%, so you'll either have to do the whole thing or live with the difference. The color varies even from batch to batch so there's no way you'll get old grout to match up with new. But you might be able to get pretty close.  If you can pry a piece out, take it to a tile store and they should have set samples of the grout you can hold yours up to. Also, tile stores move product quicker so you'll get 'fresher' grout (yes, it does go 'stale' with age, as does any cement-based product).  But people at John Bridge have had the same problem you've had and tile pros with decades of experiance have given advice, and they've done a much better job than I could ever hope to do.

(story) 2 years ago I started the yard of my new rent house and the grass so so long and dry.  After 30 minutes the mower would try to stall...Lucky for me though I figured it out after 10 minutes of troubleshooting. The air filter was BAD, it looked like the inside of a vacuum cleaner.   I just beat the air filter on the ground and finished mowing!!  I then bought a new filter.    Good Luck."

fixit,3aez0e,lukeatron,1 point,Fri Jun 19 16:18:51 2015 UTC,Mine doesn't have a throttle lever.
fixit,3aez0e,lukeatron,0,Fri Jun 19 16:36:15 2015 UTC,"There's going to be an automatic throttle attached to the handle you hold down to keep it running.  It will be attached via a spring and there will be a governor with final say on the activation of the throttle plate.  Usually the governor is a spring loaded blade that the fan on the flywheel blows on.  The faster the engine goes, the harder the fan blows, the more the governor gets pushed back which in turn pulls the throttle shut.  There's another type that uses spring loaded weights, but those are usually inside the engine.  It sounds like it's actually running ok, just throttled down, so I would look around that linkage.   Just a couple weeks ago I had a small twig get wedged up under the shroud that was pinning that governor blade all the way back.  This caused my mower to run just like yours.  It also stretched that spring out so I had to manually bend the linkage up a bit to get it back to roughly the same tension again.    If you don't really know what you're doing with any of this, be careful or maybe have some one more knowledgeable check it out.  You could damage the engine or even make it run dangerously fast if you mess it up."
fixit,3aez0e,lukeatron,1 point,Fri Jun 19 18:19:42 2015 UTC,"Ah, got it. I'll check it out. I'm fairly confident I won't mess it up. I work on my car engine all the time."
fixit,3aez0e,snaxx89,0,Fri Jun 19 18:57:57 2015 UTC,You should be fine then.  Take that shroud off and move things around a bit to see how it all connects together.  It's pretty easy to understand if you know how an engine works in general.  I just tweaked the one connection a bit until it sounded it like it was running at the right RPM.  Obviously don't be doing this with the mower running.

Look around on the outside of the house and see if there are any obvious issues such as a gutter drain pipe dumping water there, run off accumulating there when it rains, etc. If you find something like that then change the drainage in that area to keep water from accumulating there.  In my house the general ground water level rises above the level of my basement floor if we have several days of constant heavy rain. If that's the issue then I think a sump pump is your best option. That's what I have. It's sunk below the floor level and when the water level rises it kicks on and pumps the water out, routing it to the sewer line. It's an ok solution for the 1-2 times a year we get that much rain but I wouldn't want to have to depend on it regularly. If it malfunctions, float gets stuck, power goes out, etc. then you have a basement full of water again."

Nothing worse than thinking your sump pump has the problem under control down in the bowels of the house, then one day it is full of water..... The pump has level controls that turn it off and on.  You can buy inexpensive sump alarms that operate on floats to tell you if the sump is not pumping as it should.  They often have a battery backup. Friends with chronic water problems also have a spare sump motor on hand, costs about $200 and worth it to them for the peace of mind."

When batteries are left in a device like this and allowed to deplete over a long period of time, they usually leak a little bit and it can make any exposed metal oxidize pretty quickly. As long as it isn't so bad that it's eaten through the metal completely, you should be able to clean it up with some white vinegar and a Q-Tip. Go ahead and clean up the metal parts on the switch and the back of the motor while you're at it.   The battery terminals can also lose their ""springy-ness"" sometimes and prevent a good connection to the battery. If there's corrosion as well, you have a couple of compounding factors. You may be able to bend the contacts out towards the battery to help this.  Keep us updated!"

Unfortunately I couldn't figure out how to apply the 1.5 volts to the motor terminal (I feel stupid but I don't understand what ""apply"" means in this situation). There were no batteries left inside the toy while it was stored in the garage. Is it possible corrosion could occur on the battery terminals just from the Florida heat/humidity? I can still attempt the white vinegar/q-tip trick and report back."
fixit,39zh38,I_Makes_tuff,1 point,Tue Jun 16 20:31:18 2015 UTC,"No worries. I'll see if I can give you an ELI5 version:  What you need:   A battery (AAA, AA, C, or D) Two short pieces of wire. The gauge (thickness) doesn't matter in this case as long as it's not SUPER tiny. You can use an old headphone cord or an old extension cord or whatever else you can find. Strip the insulation (plastic) of the ends of both wires. You may be able to use a pocket knife, box cutter, your teeth, etc if you don't have wire strippers. Since you're trying to repair electronic equipment, you might as well spend a couple bucks at any hardware or big-box store to get a pair of wire strippers. Take the end of one wire and hold it again't one end of the battery. Take the other end of the same wire and hold it against one of the motor terminals. Take one end of the other wire and hold it against the opposite end of the battery. Take the other end of that wire and hold it against the other motor terminal. You might need a helper for all the holding.   It doesn't matter which ends of the battery or which motor terminal the wires go to, you just don't want to put a wire from one end of the battery straight to the other, which should be obvious. The worst case scenario is that the motor turns in the direction that makes the cars go down the ramp instead of up. Since our goal here is to make sure that the motor still works, it doesn't matter.  Let me know if you have questions."

Is there a way I can seal up the bottom from the outside or is the unit done for?  Could I add some life by adding a drainage line from the drip pan?  Here's the inside"
fixit,39yvfv,Kdayz,1 point,Wed Jun 17 01:33:38 2015 UTC,"A few things - that amount of rust means this is not a new issue.  If the pan in the picture (secondary) is rusted through chances are it is constant dripping from the primary pan.  The primary pan is internal and is most likely clogged.  No matter the circumstance the root of the problem needs to be addressed.  That water is supposed to be diverted to a drain or condensate pump.  If you feel like digging further, you can see how the primary pan is attached to the coil.  It may be bolted or welded.  It may be easily removable, you might have to move the coil.  The final step would be sourcing new pans.  If you can't find a product at a big box store you could call a local mechanical/hvac contractor to bend you some custom pans.    A few other suggestions - check and change your filters frequently.  When the filter gets clogged the debris ""uh finds a way"".  If the coil is clogged with dirt and fuzzies your fan looks the same.  If you are always running a HEPA filter the effects are very similar.  Your airflow will be greatly restricted, which puts strain on your system.  If you have access to your ducting you can buy mastic tape and seal it yourself.  The tape is expensive but it is a very wise investment.  You won't be losing conditioned air and you won't be sucking debris in through the ducting.  Your condensate drains should be flushed yearly.  Preventative maintenance is always less costly."

It may take several cycles, but I'm willing to bet your clothes will come out dryer each time.  Another way to check would be after running a cycle that leaves your cloathes wet, take one of the garments and dunk it into a bucket of hot water.  If you get suds after swirling it around, you have your culprit.  The solution?  Just cut your soap in half.  What's happening (if this is the problem) is that there is so much soap that it's not rinsing it all out.  At the end of the cycle the soap stays in your clothing, and as it breaks down from suds it turns into liquid, making your clothes seem wet."

This isn't your problem, you didn't dump a bunch of bacon grease into your washer, it was paper.  Drain-o probably won't have any effect on paper at all.   However, lye is very caustic, and will probably eat through the plastic/rubber hoses and parts in the washer, ruining it. I agree with checking the drain hose first.   If that doesn't solve your problem, you'll probably have to take apart the washer until you find where the paper clog is and manually remove it.  There might be some sort of filter or screen in the washer that needs to be removed and cleaned.  Try to find a service diagram online or maybe write to the manufacturer and ask for any service diagrams they have."

Make sure you mark the polarity before removing each capacitor. (place a dot or something on the side with the stripe)  To clarify what /u/Luc_R said, you want to get a capacitor with the same capacitance, and the same or higher voltage rating. The capacitance is the exact (give or take) measure of energy it stores, but the voltage rating is the maximum voltage - less is just fine. Get capacitors that have a low tolerance. Some are manufactured with actual capacitance +/- 30-50% or the rated capacitance. Also, make sure you measure the distance between leads to be sure your new cap will fit.   For any big ones, be sure to discharge them before removing. Short the leads with a resistor (preferred) or a screwdriver (not preferred)."
