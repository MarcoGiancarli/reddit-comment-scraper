Later got given to me when he realized he wasn't going to use it as much as he thought.  Awesome little device before smartphones became ubiquitous.  Doing computer things in this form factor?  Unheard of to young me.  I spent countless hours drawing with the stylus, and playing games of Jawbreaker and Bejeweled.  I later had an NES emulator and a MOD tracker on it too, which was absolutely awesome.  Unfortunately, Pocket PCs are super frustrating because the RAM doubles as the storage pool, and if the battery dies fully you lose your applications and data and have to set it all up again.  While you can stick stuff on an SD card, you'd still have to reconfigure and reinstall the programs themselves.  There's a secondary internal backup battery for use during battery swaps, but only lasts a short time.  I still have my h1945, but the battery is so toasted that it's basically useless, cause if I jump through the hoops to get it working (pretty sure it needs an XP machine for the ActiveSync to work fully), it's 15 minutes away from getting erased at any time."

The article runs through to page 125 and is a generally glowing, enthusiastic review of the two different models of this laptop.  I did a quick and dirty translation of the very end of the article.  I apologize for the quality, but this should at least give you an idea about the contents:   Conclusions  We said at the beginning that the margin of difference between the cost of the NB320s and the NB320exec is very low.  In fact, the ""inferior"" model costs ₤4.4 million and the ""superior"" model ₤4.7 million (the quotes are a must because, as said before, the two models are almost equivalent in configuration and performance).  At this point the choice becomes a question of personal taste and is strictly subjective.  The exec model has some details that make it more comfortable to use, like the carrying handle, the larger display, the greater expandability of the RAM, and the independence of the two battery packs.  As for the model s, in addition to costing less, it is a little bit smaller, a lot lighter, and already has 2MB of RAM installed.  Both products are still serious, reliable, robust, and versatile and seem to offer a competitive alternative in terms of price/performance versus the current notebook market.   The article was written in 1991, but, just for a frame of reference:  at the end of the lira's life in 1999, ₤4.7 million was equivalent to €2,427.35, or about €2,985 ($3,270) in today's money.

It was also portable, having a bay in the back for two 6 volt lead acid batteries. It was priced high as it was innovative on multiple fronts, so, to the average consumer it was something of a luxury item and not a practical buy. Additionally, this television was rather prone to malfunction, which led to it being called Sony's “frail little baby"". Released on the market in 1960, it was discontinued in 1962.

vintagecomputing,3bqwns,PhotoJim99,1 point,Wed Jul 1 21:12:42 2015 UTC,"Intel made OverDrive processors that fit in a 487 socket as well.  I upgraded my 486SX-25 to have a 486DX2-50 a few years ago - it was actually easier to find this than to find a 487, with the benefit of the system being noticeably faster.  The 487 socket has an extra pin socket; the 487 chip (and these particular OverDrive CPUs) have a pin that fits into it to instruct the system to disable the on-board CPU.  The 486SX on my system is soldered to the motherboard.  It's quite possible that filing this pin off would let you use the CPU in a normal 486 socket.  I think they have more value with the pin than without; 486 CPUs are pretty easy to find."

It's usually not feasible to do a whole calculator as an asic, you need a bunch of iterative code to run the trig and solving functions etc. this stuff is inherently procedural and just gets stored in rom or flash.

You should be able to get dos 6.22 and some nice games on there pretty easily. Just stick the hard drive in a newer computer, boot from a dos boot disk (or make a dos usb boot drive, which is a lot more work), run sys c: to make the hard drive bootable, and copy over your stuff. You might have better luck looking for full disk images you can just clone onto it. Without having the optional pcmcia floppy drive you are pretty much limited to using another computer to get this one up and running. Sorry. I feel your pain.  On the bright side, there are plenty of 16 bit pcmci ethernet cards like the 3com etherlink 3 (which works great for my libretto 50ct), and even a few wifi cards like the cisco aironet 350 (again, <3).

It says the Harddisk is a Conner CP2024, 5V 640mA. Googling for this shows contradicting information: Some say it's an IDE-disk, some say only these kinds of disk will work. Maybe you can google a supplier who can sell you a replacement.  For the batteries, a google result says 6 Batteries AA or Ni-Cad 7.2V.   Another google result says that the ROM contained a lot of utility programs; without the original Olivetti DOS, you'll probably not be able to access those.

I suppose the main problem with alternative IDE drive hardware is to make sure it only needs 5V, and doesn't draw to much current. You need datasheets that list this kind of information, and that has become rare.  I'd also check the IDE connector pinout and compare it with the two bent pins; maybe these are the 12V pins?

vintagecomputing,3ad5rv,bradn,3,Fri Jun 19 14:47:17 2015 UTC,"Generally it involves slowly raising the supply voltage over the course of a few minutes (or more) or until capacitor leakage reduces acceptably.  I'm not sure if this is recommended on computer power supplies or not.  Generally it's advice for like old radios and TVs... I'm not sure if a 5150's power supply likes having reduced voltage supplied to it.  Likely you could do a similar thing with the motherboard capacitors by slowly raising the 5V supply on a bench power supply or something.  I'm not sure if it's really worth it or not... worst case, a capacitor blows up and you replace it.  It was probably worth replacing anyway.  If you want to be scientific about it, you would have to remove all the capacitors and reform them out of circuit, measuring leakage current as you go.  But after all that trouble, why not just replace all the capacitors?  If it were me, I'd just plug the thing in, flip it on, and watch for smoke.  If something pops, shut it down, find where it was, replace it, repeat.  My guess is it will be okay... if there's a hard drive that thing might be stuck hard by now though.  If it doesn't spin, shut down, remove it, give it a twist in the air, and try again."

Then I start with an image, use gimp to convert to grayscale and scale the size. Next, I adjust brightness and contrast in order to show the areas of interest better, in this case, the VT420 itself. As a last processing step, I convert the image to a 1 bit pallette, black and white. I export this image as a RAW image from gimp, producing an image with 1 pixel per byte, each byte 0 or 1 for white and black respectively. Then I put this raw image through a quick and dirty C program I wrote which converts the image into the redefined characters I made for the VT420, and sends it to STDOUT. when I invoke the program, I pipe STDOUT to /dev/ttyS0 where the VT420 is connected, and the image scrolls up line by line :)  What really amazes me is what you can do with so little resolution. I took a picture of a picture, of a picture, of a picture of a VT420, all displayed on that same device. despite these 4 layers, you can still see the first picture I took of the VT420 before it had any picture displayed on it, and the screen is still black."

vintagecomputing,392gp3,Koh-I-Noor,3,Tue Jun 9 03:32:07 2015 UTC,"No ports seem to be the right amount of pins for a VGA signal.   You are right. I guess it's a monochrome Hercules card (with a second printer port, a common combination), but:    A female 9-pin connector on an IBM compatible personal computer may be a video display output such as MDA, Hercules, CGA, or EGA (rarely VGA or others). Even though these all use the same DE9 connector, the displays cannot all be interchanged and monitors or video interfaces may even be damaged if connected to an incompatible device using the same connector.    So you should make a pic of the card (with the chip-descriptions readable) to make sure.  Anyway, it's probably easier to buy a VGA ISA card on ebay and replace your card (you can even combine them if it's a Hercules) because getting the right monitor may be more difficult."

Perhaps they perceived this platform should have protection and the ROM was easier to do then a disk copy protector.  Here's another possibility: The ROM is not just a dongle- it might be code; ie: a library of code, so that they could use more of the limited 32k of ram for the spreadsheet space."

vintagecomputing,38oxnk,stox,1 point,Fri Jun 5 22:33:51 2015 UTC,"the TEAC FD-55B is a half-height drive.  if you get two of them you can put them both in one drive bay, then use the other bay to add a hard disk.  these are very reliable; I don't recall ever having a TEAC FD-55 fail.  I did a search for FD-55B-13-U and the picture I found is basically of a half-height drive in some kind of adapter to make it fit a full-height bay (with a Tandon-style bezel).  aside from the one that's on eBay now, I don't recall seeing them before.  IBM later replaced the full-height 360K drives with half-height drives.  these looked cosmetically like the drives used in the PC AT, except they had an asterisk molded into the front which essentially meant ""this is a double-density drive, don't stick high-density disks in here.""  in addition to AT beige, they were also available in black; the black ones could commonly be found on later model PC XT's.  I saw one on eBay that was labelled as a YE Data drive.  floppy drives don't have master/slave jumpers, but they do have drive ID numbers.  you don't have to worry about these because the twist in the cable takes care of it for you.  floppy drives may also have terminating resistors.  theoretically there are situations where they should be removed but I've never bothered or seen anyone else ever do it."
vintagecomputing,38oxnk,kgober,1 point,Fri Jun 5 23:18:03 2015 UTC,"That's an interesting idea with the two half-height drives, but as a kid I just had the plain jane model 176 with the two full height floppies so I'll probably stick with that for the sake of nostalgia.  If I do add a hard drive I'll probably go external, because IMO one of the best parts of vintage computing is loading a desk up with all the beige box peripherals you can find.  For now though I don't think I have any software that really needs a hard disk so I'll probably just go floppy to floppy.    So as far as configuration is concerned, it sounds like if I get another Tandon I just need to match the dips to the existing drive, but if I get something else I might have to set some jumpers instead.  I guess if I do see a TEAC drive I'm thinking about buying, I'll just need to make sure I can find some documentation for it first then.  I think that answers all my questions.

The ones I know  (Africa, Carlos, Good, Holiday, Spiritu) came on a ""multimedia sampler"" CD that was included with a Packard Bell system in 1995.  If I recall correctly, they originate from a company called Passport Designs (who also provided the famous Canyon.mid for Windows 3.1/95).  They came on the disc in both RMI (MIDI-like, plays fine on Windows Media Player) and WAV formats (I'm assuming the RMIs were the originals, and the WAVs were professionally mastered versions-- they are also the ones that you hear in these clips).  I've grabbed these from my files real quick (yes, I actually keep this kind of stuff on hand...) and uploaded them here.  The rest, however, I haven't a damn clue about.  Many sound very much from the same era, with that cheesy smooth jazz feel that everything ""multimedia"" seemed to sound like for a while.  A few others a bit older, with a style that reminds me of the Japanese band T-Square as it sounded in the 80s.  I suspect, though, they might be other songs provided by Passport for a different compilation, with some minimal overlap between them.  For instance, my Packard Bell disc has a bunch of similar songs (about 40 more) that I don't see represented on this tape.  I'll post any more impressions I get of these as I listen to them in more detail.  EDIT:  ""Reggae"" sounds like a Roland MT-32 and reminds me a lot of the Monkey Island games, although I haven't played them enough to know offhand if it might be from one of the games."

vintagecomputing,36su74,zackaryvs,5,Thu May 21 21:04:25 2015 UTC,Don't.  Those cables often have the ground lines all tied together and the pinout for parallel and scsi is different.  There's a VCC line to power the terminator and you'll risk making a mess if you short it.
vintagecomputing,36su74,mariuolo,2,Fri May 22 07:37:39 2015 UTC,"I suppose if the parallel cable wires all 25 pins straight through, it should work.  but if the cable is too long (like over 6 feet) you might have problems.  SCSI cables were typically much shorter than printer cables.  when I think of a ""standard"" parallel cable I think of a DB25 on one end and a 36-pin Centronics connector on the other end.  clearly this won't work for SCSI because SCSI uses a 50-pin Centronics connector for that kind of cable.  I assume you're talking about a DB25-to-DB25 straight through cable (which ought to work equally well as a parallel or a serial cable).  note that if it's a ZIP Plus drive, you will need the original cable because it's somehow special (part of what makes the parallel/SCSI dual-mode feature of the ZIP Plus work)."

vintagecomputing,36su74,kgober,1 point,Fri May 22 04:25:24 2015 UTC,"worth a try, if you have the cable already.  afaik, the proper SCSI cable you would need in this case is a 25-pin straight through cable with DB25M connectors on both ends.  in terms of wiring, any cables with a DB25M on both ends, and all 25 pins wired straight through, are equivalent.  but there are differences in cables due to shielding, internal twisted pairs, impedance, etc., that can make a difference in certain situations.  certainly when using SCSI-2 or higher, it matters.  for SCSI-1 I think you can get away with using a non-SCSI cable, if you're connecting just the Zip drive and nothing else.  if you have multiple devices in a chain I would just try to get a proper SCSI cable (it wouldn't need to be the Iomega blue cable)."
vintagecomputing,36su74,dragsys,1 point,Fri May 22 12:36:10 2015 UTC,"Looks like the SCSI Zip uses the Macintosh 25 pin SCSI wiring, so no you couldn't just use a normal 25 pin parallel cable. Although as /u/thunderbird32 pointed out, you can find (or build) converters and it also looks like the cables are not that expensive on ebay.    As a note, it appears that there was also a version of the Zip drive (the ""Zip Plus"") that was both SCSI and Parallel and that required a special cable from Iomega."
vintagecomputing,36su74,kgober,1 point,Fri May 22 11:32:54 2015 UTC,"pinouts for parallel and SCSI are different when you have a DB25 on one end, and something else on the other.  for example, a SCSI DB25-to-Centronics50 is wired differently than a Parallel DB24-to-Centronics36.  in these cases, you may have 1 pin on the DB25 side wired to many pins on the Centronics end, and the choice of which pins are wired to which pins can be very different.  but a 25-pin straight through cable can be thought of simply as a port extender, bringing the port on the back of your computer closer to your device.  ignoring things like impedance mismatches and shielding, effectively all it does is move the end of the port closer to where you need it.  but to use a 25-pin cable as a port extender, all the pins have to be wired STRAIGHT THROUGH.  you can't use a typical DB25 serial cable for this because many such cables only internally have 9 pins connected, and they're not straight through (2 on one end might be wired to 3 on the other, etc.)"

The cable leading to the breakout box was extremely thick, like a spinal cable, and the box itself small and light. This led to the box moving around and putting a ton of torsion on the connector. Despite this, the rectangular connector had no strain relief, and the entire retention mechanism was just a friction fit, with no screws that held it in place. This meant that whenever you accidentally moved the breakout box, the gigantic cable would twist and yank out the back of the computer, leading to about a dozen bent pins inside of the rectangular connector."

I could watch live TV on my computer, including cable (but I never did get those cable descramblers to work...), and all this at a time when it was pretty rare to be able to do that without some really expensive video editing rig. Though maybe Amiga users would laugh and say they could do that all the way back in 1990 or something.  You could record live TV as well, like a Tivo, but I always found my computer had trouble keeping up, either because of the CPU, HDD, or IDE controller. I used it to capture video from my video camera and bring it into Premiere for editing, as well as output video that I'd record on a VHS deck."

The 80386SX variant of article  Intel 80386:       In 1988, Intel introduced the 80386SX, most often referred to as the 386SX, a cut-down version of the 80386 with a 16-bit data bus mainly intended for lower cost PCs aimed at the home, educational, and small business markets while the 386DX would remain the high end variant used in workstations, servers, and other demanding tasks. The CPU remained fully 32-bit internally, but the 16-bit bus was intended to simplify circuit board layout and reduce total cost.  The 16-bit bus simplified designs but hampered performance. Only 24 pins were connected to the address bus, therefore limiting addressing to 16 MB,  but this was not a critical constraint at the time. Performance differences were due not only to differing data bus-widths, but also due to performance-enhancing cache memories often employed on boards using the original chip.

vintagecomputing,35v8dy,redruM69,4,Wed May 13 20:10:03 2015 UTC,Probably not because the keyboard seems missing.
vintagecomputing,35v8dy,X700,1 point,Wed May 13 20:57:54 2015 UTC,It is possible.  I found a keyboard for one of these sold on eBay for $330+.  Still no evidence on the value of the terminal itself though.
vintagecomputing,35v8dy,tails_the_gay_fox,1 point,Wed May 13 20:59:39 2015 UTC,The keyboard can be converted for use on a modern system via a micro controller and some other components thus making odd keyboard a collectible thing.
vintagecomputing,35v8dy,bradn,1 point,Wed May 13 21:22:19 2015 UTC,And vice versa it should be possible to adapt a standard PS/2 keyboard to the terminal with a little microcontroller effort.
vintagecomputing,35v8dy,tails_the_gay_fox,1 point,Thu May 14 01:16:49 2015 UTC,Also true
vintagecomputing,35v8dy,kgober,4,Thu May 14 03:02:06 2015 UTC,"my understanding is that these terminals need to be connected to a terminal controller such as an IBM 3174 using coaxial cable.  the terminal controller would then be connected to a larger system (typically an IBM mainframe).  you can't do much with just the terminal because you can't attach it to anything without a controller, and even if you get a controller you won't be able to do much without a mainframe to connect the controller to.  contrast that with ASCII terminals with RS-232 connections, which can be used with almost any kind of system, including modern Unix/Linux computers (almost anything with a serial port on it, really).  so one of these might be worth something as a display piece, but I doubt it's worth much to people who are setting up vintage/retro systems in their garages or basements."
vintagecomputing,35v8dy,jzatarski,3,Wed May 13 21:38:30 2015 UTC,"unfortunately, these are a bit specific to IBM mainframe hardware. the 3278 was intended to be used with an IBM S/390 and predecessors/successors, not with anything else. as a result, nothing ever came with an interface for these terminals, except for IBM mainframes. Anyway, it might be worth something, but it's a very niche market, and the missing keyboard doesn't help.  And I meant to say, the interface isn't anything near standard either. they use a single coax cable to communicate with the mainframe.  also, they still use emulators of these even today. Some institutions never really moved away from their IBM mainframe stuff even today, places like banks mostly. They upgraded the hardware, but not the software. This is pretty much the only reason IBM is still selling their mainframe lines."

vintagecomputing,35ppky,ido,13,Tue May 12 14:24:34 2015 UTC,"I suspect the fact it was a strict Harvard architecture has a lot to do with it.  Great for embedded applications where it only ever had to run one program, even better if that one program fit on the internal program rom (4KB on early models).   But for 8bit home micro-computers where you want to dynamically swap out the program this works against you. Your home computer would need two banks of memory, one for program and one for data. And because the 8051 provides absolutely no method of writing to the program memory, you would need to add external circuitry to do that or use expensive dual ported ram.  With memory being one of the more expensive parts of 8bit micro-computers, it just made sense to select one of the other options with a von Neumann architecture."
vintagecomputing,35ppky,phire,3,Tue May 12 15:24:41 2015 UTC,"you could just do away with the separate code and data segments. just make data and code accesses go to the same place. But the point is that the 8051 was intended to be a microcontroller, not a microprocessor. It was slow too, most instructions took 12 cycles IIRC."
vintagecomputing,35ppky,jzatarski,2,Tue May 12 15:55:17 2015 UTC,"Might be harder than you think.  If the 8051 accesses both the data and the code in the same cycle (I don't know if it does, but that's kind of the point of having separate buses) then what is your memory system going to do? It can't service both requests at once."
vintagecomputing,35ppky,phire,2,Wed May 13 01:12:49 2015 UTC,"no, I've worked with the 8051 a bit. There aren't separate buses, there's a single unified bus, and there's a 'data/code' select line, high for one, low for the other. if you just don't use that, then you basically do away with the separate data and code spaces, though you are then limited to 64K of addressing space. with separate code and data, you get to have 64K of code independent of the 64K of data, for up to 128K total memory.  http://www.keil.com/dd/docs/datashts/intel/80xxah_ds.pdf  take a look at page five there, the /PSEN output goes low to select the code space, and stays high to select the data space."
vintagecomputing,35ppky,jzatarski,3,Wed May 13 17:45:52 2015 UTC,"The 8031 was a romless (or rom disabled) version of the 51. And yet it was not adopted as the main cpu for a micro.  The issue is that it came out too late. By 1980, when it was introduced, the 8080, Z80, 6502 and 680x CPUs were well established. The 8086 was introduced in 1978 and the 8088 in 79. Ditto the 68000 (79), Z8000 (79).    Too little, too late and not compatible with anything. No sense in taking the risk."
vintagecomputing,35ppky,factus10,2,Tue May 12 22:27:37 2015 UTC,"the 8051 is a microcontroller while the 6502, z80, 6800, and 8088/6 were all microprocessor. The latter were designed for computing applications whereas the 8051 was designed for embedded control applications. Also, they came out at different times, like you said the '51 came out in 1980, so microcontroller architecture problems aside it was too slow by then anyway."

Grab some old-ass versions off of Zophar's Domain and see what buggy hacks were possible with fake BIOS and a pittance of CPU power. Maybe get VirtualGBA and check out all the once-impressive demos from GBAdev.org.   There's also Machines by Acclaim, an apparently-forgotten 3D RTS. Dungeon Keeper will run like a dream. Get the Quake II demo and compare software mode with orange-ass OpenGL. Get the Quake III demo and be amazed how well it runs. (I'll bet Matrix Quake runs like drawn butter.) Redline Racer. G-Police. Encarta, to see what life was like before Wikipedia. Run Doom 95, then drop back into DOS to see what it's supposed to look like. Find anyone 30-ish and ask to borrow their big black binder of demo disks. Really - anyone.  And since this is /r/VintageComputing and not /r/RetroGaming - compare WinAmp 2.x and RealJukebox (if you can still find RealJukebox). Listen to a dozen mislabeled MP3s on repeat with Milkdrop and Monkey visualiztions. Install Netscape, Opera, and Mozilla, and then never ever ever connect to the real internet. Get Shockwave and see how far browser games haven't come. Get grey-ass Quicktime and watch an AMV in a tiny window because fullscreen was a premium feature that would've melted your CPU anyway.

vintagecomputing,33umve,raiderofawesome,1 point,Sat Apr 25 20:50:33 2015 UTC,It's because of the custom modeline and the use of the G signal. OP basically programmed the card to be compatible with MDA timings.
vintagecomputing,33umve,LocalH,3,Sun Apr 26 02:23:15 2015 UTC,"still though, even I was surprised it worked. The modeline should have been just fine, but the analog RGB outputs of VGA should be (in theory) 0 to 0.7v levels. this entire range counts as a ttl '0'. On the other hand, VGA outputs are supposed to be terminated into a 75 ohm load, so it might make sense that the higher input impedance of a TTL input could cause the voltages to be higher if the video device is designed to drop voltage based on the 75 ohm load in the monitor."
vintagecomputing,33umve,kgober,1 point,Sun Apr 26 03:14:28 2015 UTC,"I'm surprised it worked because this monitor was built (so I always believed) for NTSC timings in common use at the time for systems like the Apple II, Atari 800, Commodore 64, etc. (15.7KHz horizontal sync frequency, 60Hz vertical sync frequency) while MDA uses different timings (18.4KHz horizontal, 50Hz vertical).  it's possible the Amdek was engineered to support fairly wide deviations in timings, although it's also possible that this will work for a while then simply burn out something inside the monitor due to stressing it too hard."
vintagecomputing,33umve,LocalH,1 point,Sun Apr 26 04:34:32 2015 UTC,"It can't be both MDA with NTSC timings. Either it had a TTL connector and was geared towards MDA, or it's a mono composite monitor (if it had an RCA connector) with enough variance for the MDA timings. The 50Hz part isn't that strange, many old 60Hz NTSC-timed monitors could lock to 50Hz (possibly with some adjustment). The H rate is ehere things usually get hairy, and why I suspect this monitor may not support NTSC timing. If it does, great!"

For 486; I want a DX4-100 with 2MB cirrus logic graphics, 32MB RAM, and a couple 1GB IDE spindles. There were two compaqs I loved for this genre: the 744 desktop and, IIRC, the 728 AIO. The AIO is a real treat, sporting a so so 15"" tube with chassis and speakers in one unit. The desktop had a mix of PCI/ISA and 4 SIMM slots. I wish I still had mine, but I was a noob and installed an upgrade cpu incorrectly and torched the board. The pins weren't unidirectional - so I installed the cpu backwards.   I could also argue in favor of a Packard bell p75 or ast bravo if you could find one."

They were introduced in '89, but they weren't common in gaming systems until '92 or so.

Maybe I should just stick with socket 4 and relegate the pentium-class stuff to the Gateway machine.   Actually, now that I think about it, as long as I source a compatible board I could could always swap in a Pentium Overdrive if I ever found an instance where I needed an extra speed bump.  Or really push my luck and overclock it.  I've never really tried on anything older than socket 7, and I sometimes miss the days of overclocking with jumper settings.  God knows I got plenty of practice with jumper settings being one of the 10 or so people that owned a Cyrix M2."

My 486 system from this era (from the end of 1992) was a 486 DX/50 with 8 MB RAM, a 200 MB IDE hard drive, a 1.2 MB 5.25"" floppy drive (A:), a 1.44 MB 3.5"" floppy drive (B:), a single-speed CD-ROM drive (using the Creative interface) with caddy connected to a first-generation SB Pro, and a Diamond SpeedStar 24X video card.   I'm split between Adlib, Roland and Soundblaster for audio on the late 80s early 90s system   There's little point in installing an Adlib and a Sound Blaster in the same system.  The Sound Blaster basically is an Adlib card with added support for digital recorded audio; for music, it uses the exact same Yamaha YM3812 chip as an FM synthesizer.  The MT-32 will produce some fantastic wavetable music for games that support it; its heyday in PC gaming was from ~1987 to ~1994 -- by the mid-'90s, games started going over to GM music or recorded CD audio.  But the MT-32 is for music only; it's possible to get some recorded audio out of it by uploading short audio clips to the custom patch banks, and some games do this, but it's pretty limited. If you're going to use an MT-32, you'll need a MIDI interface to connect it to the system, and that's something that the Sound Blaster will provide.    So your best bet is to install a Sound Blaster, and optionally connect an MT-32 to its MIDI port for enhanced music.  A good option for a build focused on a slightly later era would be a Gravis Ultrasound.  They can be finicky to configure, but have great GM support."

vintagecomputing,33nzml,diemonkeys,2,Fri Apr 24 02:02:19 2015 UTC,"I think the card you labelled as a ""serial card"" is actually half of what would normally be on the motherboard.  the other half is the ""cpu card"".  on most systems of this type, the motherboard contained the CPU, memory, and all the supporting chips (DMA controllers, interrupt controllers, etc.).  this system appears to have a 'passive' motherboard (nothing but slots) and all the logic is on cards.  since there's too much to fit onto one card it's split into one card for the CPU, and another card for everything else.  it looks like your 'i/o card' also comes with a parallel printer port, and a 9-pin serial port.  these were commonly considered 'must-have' options so it's not surprising that they were included.  you are unlikely to be able to upgrade the CPU unless the CPU card was designed with upgrades in mind.  I would not be surprised if the original intention was for you to replace the entire CPU card if you wanted to upgrade.  look for jumpers on the CPU card that allow you to change the CPU speed, if you find any then an upgrade may actually be possible.  you should be able to install an IDE controller (assuming you can get your hands on one) but your BIOS may limit how big a drive you can use (or boot from).  SCSI is also an option.  there's plenty you can do without a VGA card, and with a CPU that old you may not be able to run VGA games anyway, so don't be in too big a hurry to replace the display you have.  if it's EGA then it will be fine for old DOS games."

Any cards with that third set of fingers is likely to be part of what you'd expect to be on a ""normal"" motherboard - CPU complex, memory, serial/parallel, drive controllers, etc.  Zenith's desktop machines generally worked well. We got good service out of a pile of their XT clones at my college. Had a demo 386 for a while running XENIX that was a real eye opener in terms of micros replacing minicomputers. Not long afterwards we actually set a department up to run off of a Z-386 running Concurrent-DOS 386, using a handful of EasyPCs as remote terminals accessing database apps over serial lines, but could also be flipped over to standalone apps as needed. IIRC we put a VGA card in this Z-386 driving a ""paperwhite"" monochrome monitor.  That early demo Z-386 was clocked at 16MHz, but we later got hold of 20 or 25MHz units. I'd say there's a non-zero chance of being able to upgrade to a faster CPU but try to find the documentation for your CPU card to see if that just takes some jumper changes, or required a new EPROM or PAL that might be difficult to find now."

vintagecomputing,32g2j9,zoso4evr,4,Mon Apr 13 14:42:54 2015 UTC,"it's possible that your printer has an escape sequence to set form length that the old computer was set to send as an initialization string of sorts to the printer.  http://my.okidata.com/Mandown.nsf/%28DownloadBPXManual%29/MAN-590  The above is a link to the okidata website where you can get the manual for your printer. If you look at the reference section, you can see that the menu table shows a page length setting. If one of these page length settings matches the length of your forms, you can try this setting to see if it works as you want it to. If the printer does not save this setting when you power it off, it could indicate that the printer has a battery backed RAM chip for which the battery has died. Sometimes these can be replaced, other times they cannot.  I have more to say, but I have to go to class, so I'll add more later."
vintagecomputing,32g2j9,jzatarski,3,Mon Apr 13 16:56:00 2015 UTC,"EDIT: it's worth noting that the Okidata reference manual recomends using the previous method to set form length if that is the kind of printing you will usually be doing. If you print a mix of these labels and other documents, this method is probably the better one to use. Also, in order to use these control codes in software, you need to find somewhere to put them. This depends on what operating system you are using, as well as possibly the software you are using. In order to help you with that, I would need to know what software you are using, and on what operating system (windows, DOS, linux, OS/2, whatever)  so the second part to this is that the printer supports various control/escape codes/sequences. It supports a few different sets, depending on the emulation mode. The first is Epson LQ (so called ESC/P I believe), IBM PPR (also known as IBM PPDS and IBM proprinter) as well as IBM AQM (one which I have not heard of until now). Most likely, your printer is set to Epson emulation if you haven't messed with it, since that was kind of the de-facto standard at the time.  So here is the reference manual on the Okidata website for the various control codes/sequences that the 590 supports: http://my.okidata.com/MANTR320.NSF/MOCContents/54ABF0D91DE087E5852561B70077BC52?OpenDocument  It appears there are two different style of 'set page length' commands, one which sets the length in lines, and one which sets the length in inches. They are listed here and on the next page: http://my.okidata.com/MANTR320.NSF/MOCContents/54ABF0D91DE087E5852561B70077BC52?OpenDocument For Epson emulation mode, the 'set page length in inches' command is: ESC C NUL n That is, the escape character, followed by the ASCII CAPITAL C character, followed by the NULL character (value 0), followed by the number of inches long the form is. Keep in mind the length is not an ASCII number, it's a direct value. This is similar for the command for setting the page length in lines. This command is: ESC C n That is, the ASCII Escape character, ASCII CAPITAL C, followed by the number of lines the form is long.  After the printer is setup in this way via these commands, or the aforementioned menu settings in my previous post, an ASCII Form Feed control code should advance the forms to the top of the next form, rather than feeding a whole page. Let me know if this works for you."

The DE-9 connector with the dip switches makes me think that it's an EGA video adapter.  You'll need an EGA monitor and the switches are used to set the mode.  That also likely puts the vintage in the mid to late 80s.  Hard to say what the mini-DIN-9 is.  A Microsoft bus mouse would fit the vintage though.  The male DB-25 up top is your serial port.

I've been trying to dig up good information regarding the ss10 for awhile, but it isn't always easy to find everything. I did some more reading up on this and might have found something interesting, let me run this idea by you if that's ok. I found this old Sun manual regarding frame buffers: http://docs.oracle.com/cd/E19253-01/817-0438-10/817-0438-10.pdf  On page 10 it says if the frame buffer doesn't receive one of 8 signals from the monitor it defaults to 1152 x 900 at 66 Hz which like you said is outside the resolution of my monitor. I came across this post though on gentoo's wiki: https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Sparc/FAQ#I_have_a_CRT.2FLCD_monitor_attached_to_my_SPARC_that_selects_a_resolution_my_monitor_can.27t_handle_when_the_kernel_boots._How_do_I_get_a_visible_and.2For_non-distorted_display_on_my_monitor.3F  Where they said that you can use the command:  setenv output-device screen:r1024x768x60  at the openboot prom command prompt to force another resolution. I tried this and it didn't work for me, but I came across this website http://www.sunhelp.org/faq/FrameBuffer.html#31 where they list the different resolutions available to each framebuffer. I have a Sun GX in mine and they listed all the resolutions available which didn't even include 1024 x 768 @ 60hz:  1022 x 1000 @ 76            IPX only 1024 x  800 @ 85            IPX only 1024 x  768 @ 77            LX only 1152 x  900 @ 66  1152 x  900 @ 76 1280 x 1024 @ 67  1280 x 1024 @ 76  LX with 1Mb VSIMM only 1600 x 1280 @ 76            LX with 1Mb VSIMM only  I was thinking if a swapped the frame buffer for a different one, like one of the turbo gx's I might be able to force a resolution/refresh rate (the Dell 1505FP caps out at 75hz) which might work.  Does this track, or am I just going way too far down a rabbit hole?"
vintagecomputing,31yiit,dogellionaire,1 point,Fri Apr 10 02:32:17 2015 UTC,"Actually, it looks like you're 100% right so far.   I got the default resolution from the Wikipedia entry on the Sparcstation model line.   I think your best bet is going to be the 1280x1024 @ 67Hz, but even then the monitor might balk. I'd try any or even all of those modes under 75Hz before giving up on your current framebuffer and flat panel, though.   Modern LCDs are fussy, and typically made for Windows-oriented graphics adapters. It took me forever to find an LCD and a framebuffer mode that worked properly for my Sun Ultra-2, but I did find something.   I'm sure your Sparcstation will be doing the same in no time.

Something dual core or up with XP or better, grab a cheap USB video capture device, and you can record straight to mpeg2.  Use dvdstyler to make menus, dvdshrink to make it fit on a 4.4GB disc.  Several years back I did a summer project where we took a dual CPU pentium 3 1GHz and wanted to do the same thing (VHS -> DVD) in linux with all open source software.  It was absolutely horrid back then.  The two CPUs were just barely adequate to do real-time mpeg2 encoding, and getting the capture card and linux commands and procedures to work is something I don't even want to talk about.  Now we use windows for the actual video capture, and reboot to linux for dvdstyler, dvdshrink, and burning, but actually we could even do those steps in windows if we wanted to."

vintagecomputing,314s3r,Famicoman,2,Thu Apr 2 12:00:44 2015 UTC,"The current 32-bit version of VirtualDub will run on Win 9x.  If the All-in-Wonder's drivers are properly installed, it should show up as a capture source in the 'Device' menu of VirtualDub's capture mode.  You'll be able to have low-level control over all of the capture settings this way: resolution, framerate, colorspace, etc.  I used close to your exact configuration -- ATI All-in-Wonder on a Win 98 SE box -- as my primary system throughout college, and did plenty of video capture on it.  I actually used the ATI media center software as my television when I lived in the dorm.  In more recent years (~ 2008), I used VirtualDub with my All-in-Wonder 9600XT to digitize old VHS tapes, by capturing losslessly (using the HuffYUV codec) at full resolution (720x480 for NTSC) and full frames (29.97 fps), and then applied a combination of VirtualDub and AviSynth filters to deinterlace, crop, aspect correct, and color correct the video (VHS tapes degrade over time, and distorted color is often the most visible impact of this). The end result was lots of good-quality 640x480 videos.  If you're willing to put a bit of effort in, you can get some great results with the right tools.  The Doom9 website is one of the best resources around for information about video capture and processing -- if you can't find what you need on Reddit, you'll probably be able to find tools and techniques there."
vintagecomputing,314s3r,ILikeBumblebees,2,Tue Apr 7 18:19:55 2015 UTC,"Even if you used modern hardware/software,  you're not going to ever get 480p, as that information is lost. Depending on the quality of tape, and how many generations of copy it is, 240p might be optimistic. Composite video isn't helping either."
vintagecomputing,314s3r,stox,5,Thu Apr 2 01:01:14 2015 UTC,"Not entirely true - you should never lose resolution between scanlines - there's just too much separation between them.  You might conceivably lose some horizontal resolution, and color correctness definitely suffers.  The worst problem with degraded VHS tapes is when it gets bad enough that the sync signals can't be correctly detected and scanlines start wiggling around because it can't tell where they start, or if lines are missed completely it gets really wacky.  Color can drop out if it starts missing the special signals that are needed for that.  But yeah, the same count of lines that were recorded will still be there (if the video is still watchable otherwise)."
vintagecomputing,314s3r,bradn,2,Thu Apr 2 01:30:06 2015 UTC,"VHS is pretty much raw composite video on tape. When the tape got bad enough you lost sync, you already had lost a good deal of signal. Interestingly enough, a good way to recover sync was to dub to a Beta deck. You still lost on the real video content, though.    Do note that the signal from the deck is interlaced, and most VHS decks were lacking in bandwidth to begin with."
vintagecomputing,314s3r,stox,3,Thu Apr 2 02:07:05 2015 UTC,"Yeah it was kinda a barely adequate format, but at least the earlier VCRs were pretty well built.

If you've got stuff on VHS that you want to keep, either convert it yourself or find someone to do it for you, or it could be gone!"

vintagecomputing,313pr6,thewriter1,3,Wed Apr 1 20:04:01 2015 UTC,"As they are? No, they are not.  Reasons are pretty simple; the CPUs they use are far too slow and use limited instructions compared to the CPUs of today. In addition, the memory capacity is 10,000-100,000 times less than today.  That said, it is possible (in some cases) to run more modern operating systems, like Contiki, but never anything as advanced as Windows or Mac OS.  Linux requires a Memory Management Unit (not a feature of the machines you mention), as do most other recent Operating Systems.   You can find later systems such as the Mac SE/30 (also a compact Mac like the 128K), Atari ST, and Commodore Amiga have the features necessary (like enough RAM, fast enough CPU, and hard disk controllers) to make modern software useful, but it requires significant effort even then."

There are a number of upgrades for Amiga systems that originally had a 25MHz processor that enable CPU upgrades up to 250MHz+, like the PowerUp.  The ZX uses a Z-80A processor, which (as an architecture) really doesn't have an upgrade path, and with everything of note in ROM, cart or on tape - there's not a fat enough data bus to enable much more useful work."

I know that these machines are quite rare nowadays, so I have no wish to be reckless. I'll keep what parts still work and sell them on to someone who needs them for their own. Only seems fair and the machine itself lives on, in an odd way.   EDIT: Actually, I have just come across a parts/repair Master. Should be coming in the next couple of weeks.

vintagecomputing,313pr6,the_wandering_nerd,2,Thu Apr 2 09:30:58 2015 UTC,"When you start looking at the hardware upgrades it takes to run a modern OS, it starts feeling more like the original computer has become a peripheral to the modern guts (where most of the action is taking place).  So, yeah it's possible to stick a 2GHz processor in there and run linux or something, but the original computer would be pretty much just acting as a really low end display adapter and doing keyboard/etc duty.  Is it possible to run a modern OS on the original CPUs?  Yes, but it would get very very ugly and slow.  For instance, linux has been run on an 8 bit microcontroller with only a few KB of RAM inside and operating at like 16MHz or something.  But it did it by emulating a higher capability processor (which linux was already ported to) and using an external 16MB memory stick.  It's really really slow in their implementation, and even if the emulation were optimized, it would still be really slow.  I believe it took it a few minutes to even boot the kernel.  It's even possible, in theory, to port modern OS's to old systems, but it would still require at minimum additional memory installed (you'd probably have best results building your own MMU), and doing serious compiler surgery to create something that knows how to emit code that will work on it.  Not for the faint of heart... you'd need a paradoxical mix of genius and stupid to successfully tackle a project like that."

Wings OS for the Commodore 64 attempts to bring some modern functionality to the venerable old system (like music and video playing and limited networking) but even then you need to bolt on a 20 MHz CPU upgrade card and multiple megabytes of extra RAM. At that point, the classic computer itself is merely just a slow, clunky display driver and keyboard for the cobbled-on parts. You'd be better off either getting a slightly-newer classic computer like a Mac SE/30 or an Amiga, or, if you just like the looks of the classic computer, gut the insides and install a Raspberry Pi in the case."

vintagecomputing,313pr6,sonicboi,1 point,Fri Apr 17 03:40:54 2015 UTC,"Nope. They are veeery old and slow. You can't upgrade the components to something modern enough, the motherboards have completely different sockets (hell I don't even know if you can replace their CPU's, even if you can there's no way you can put a modern one in). You don't have enough RAM and you can't put enough of it in. The Mac is the machine with the most RAM, and is still only has 128 kilobytes. AntiX is a very lightweight Linux distro, they claim that it can run on a system with 64 MB of RAM. (to give you an idea of how little that is, Lubuntu, another lightweight Linux distro, needs 512 MB. As for Windows, I think it needs 1 or 2 GB, not sure.) So the Mac has 500 times less RAM than the most ridiculously lightweight OS I've ever heard of. As for graphics, the Spectrum couldn't handle more than 16 different colours, and it could only have a number of them on the screen at the same time IIRC. Sound was also barely a thing. They are waay too old to use CD's, let alone USB drives. I'm willing to bet that the connection used by the floppy drive isn't compatible with any CD drive, and USB is either built into the motherboard or into PCI expansion cards. They are too old to have PCI slots and they're obviously not built in. The only thing you could do is replace the guts completely. Well, I'm 99% sure you could do something so that you could still use the Spectrum's and the Micro's  keyboards somehow, but apart from that you'd just get a modern computer that looks cool and doesn't have great cooling. At least I don't see how you could get a good cooling system in one of those cases. Hell, I don't really see how you could fit anything other than a Raspberry Pi or something similar in there.

A lot of the old operating systems are really fascinating and make you think a little different about how to do things. Try to see it through that lens if you can.

So you're either missing the drive controller and you can use any old ~20-100MB IDE drive, or it's integrated to the motherboard in which case you're gonna have to find another example of the exact same hard drive"

You could also try attaching another composite monitor if you have one.  Any composite monitor  should work.  If you have a keyboard and still no video: - Press the ""b"" key and then Enter to see if one of the floppy drives lights up.  If you see floppy drive activity, then the monitor is bad.

On my 640x400 monitor, depending on where I was in the set, it was taking 25-30+ hours to generate a single image.  While starting to write a fixed-point library to speed things up, I discovered Fractint, and just wrote a driver for my weird graphics adapter and started using that.

The Portable III is smaller and vastly more powerful (the II runs a 286-8, which is the ugly child of the x86 series; the III has a 386), but the plasma display is a lot less cool than the Matrix-like CRT in the II, at least in my opinion."

Maybe I'll even fill in some of the gaps in the middle as time goes on.   Last night I won an auction for the Zenith SuperSport 286, working, with AC adapter, two batteries, an original carrying case, and a collection of floppy disks for $71 which thankfully was in my price-range.  I don't know if that counts as collectible prices, hopefully not.  At any rate, it was within reach for me so I'm okay paying it anyhow.  Shipping is going to be a bit high, the auction calculated out $46 but that was for priority mail.  He's quoting me fedex ground sometime today which I hope gets that down to about half the USPS quote.    I found and screen-capped a review from InfoWorld Magazine's October 1988 edition for the SuperSport 286, so I think I was incorrect in dating it from 1990 in the OP.    I got to watching a few episodes of The Computer Chronicles on youtube last night, they had episodes dedicated to portables in 1987 and 1989, and it was so neat seeing all the old technology.  There was one unit made by ITC that had a huge antenna coming off of the screen and came with a built-in cellular modem and mobile phone handset.

I actually discovered the Jornada range these some time ago, but I learned of some issues that might hinder their general-purpose practicality for me.   My hands aren't small, they're small-medium sized. I can type on the standard PC keyboard I'm using right now relatively easily, although I wouldn't mind if it were a tad smaller (and I don't mind smallish laptop keyboards at all). However, based on the understanding that Jornadas are only a tiny bit bigger than my Ericsson MC218, I have a bit of consternation about getting one because my MC218 is both impossible to type on with two thumbs and also quite difficult to type reliably on when it's on a flat surface too. I'm primarily going for ""flat surface"" use myself; how well do Jornadas hold up/perform in that usage scenario? I'm hazy on the exact details; what's the situation nowadays with Linux and suspend? Does the CPU sucessfully drop into low-power mode, or do I have to cold-boot the device each time I want to use it?   A Jornada does admittedly sound somewhat interesting, although at this point I probably wouldn't go out of my way to deliberately hunt one down on eBay, for example."

It types rather nicely in that setting, and I was using it for AIM and IRC primarily.  On the subject of suspend, as of the JLime build I have (been ages, don't remember which) suspend works but isn't the HUGE help to battery that you'd expect. It does suspend and wake properly, but it only gives you an extra few hours before needing a charge. Maybe my battery is toast. Given it's a LiOn and a decade old, I'd not be shocked. I could squeak by a day at work, though. Had to pull and re-insert the WiFi card when waking to get it detected again, but that was no big deal.  If you're still considering the MobilePro, note that it is considerably bigger in the keyboard and screen department. There's a community WinCE ROM for it that has a lot of neat features including under- and over-clocking. It does still fit in a pocket, though, and has some other cool features like decent stereo sound (which the Jornada 680 lacks) and even enough CPU power to play videos in the 320x240 or 432x240 range. If nothing else, it makes a better internet-connected media toy. :-)"

I'd gotten the impression that the lack of proper CPU powerdown/sleep code was the end of the world for battery life; thanks for clearing that up. A day of usage is not too bad!  The MobilePro does seem quite a bit bigger than the Jornada series - but taking into account that you've mentioned that even the Jornada keyboard is comfortably usable, I'm beginning to think that either my MC218's keyboard was just too small for my hands and I'll have better luck with another device, or that I'm asking too much (non-cramped + high WPM) of the keyboards found in this class of portable device generally. Hopefully it's the first one :)  Decent audio is always preferable :D and video support is always nice to have... and with the bigger keyboard, the MobilePro sounds fun. I don't mind WinCE at all - it was one of Microsoft's best operating systems - and all I really need at the end of the day is a text editor, SSH, and possibly VNC."

They're both genuinely useful in addition to a lot of fun. I need to dig mine out of storage for some photos.   And yeah, with the apps that were written in the early 2000's, and with CMONEX's ROM on it, WinCE on the MobilePro is practically a joy to work with. I get WiFi, I can SSH into my Linux boxes, and play media files in TCPMP all day. The Opera web browser even gets me into things like Facebook at a usable level."

This is really bad; now I need to find one of each to play with so I can decide which I like more. :p  I'd probably start with a MobilePro though, based on the 90% size.

I'm interested to know what kinds of issues I might end up inheriting (translation: ""used mobilepro on ebay"")   You will need to re-cell the battery of any 900C you find on eBay. It uses two 18650 LiIon cells, which are very easy to find these days - get brand-name Sanyo, Sony or Panasonic ones if you want them to last; Chinese ones (usually with a name ending in -fire, such as Ultrafire, Trustfire, Spiderfire...) are cheaper and may or may not do the job, but they absolutely won't last as long. Be aware of a few new types that tempt with higher mAh numbers but charge to a higher voltage (4.35V); you want the ordinary ones that are topped up at 4.2V. You'll need decent soldering iron skills; lacking those, you can get protected cells, strip the protection and end up with usable tabs.  The 900C is quite solid. It comes from an era when mobile devices weren't impulse-bought by fashion victims and hipsters, and therefore lacks the delicate feeling of modern paper-thin glossy-surfaced ultramobiles. It's thick, it's chunky and it's made of hard plastic that'll survive rough treatment. There are no problems that I know of about hinges and screen cables. Mine has a flaky inverter or backlight panel on half the display, and will power off that side on the very lowest setting, but just setting the brightness to the second-lowest setting fixes the problem.  The touchscreen is, of course, resistive. You will need a stylus or fingernails. Somewhat surprisingly, mine came with the original stylus; far more surprisingly, I managed not to lose it. If the one you get doesn't have it, I'm not sure how easy it'd be to replace it with one that clicks properly in the side hole - it's thicker than any generic ones I've seen.  The CF slot is very useful to swap files with a computer. The 900C has USB host capability as well, but at least on mine it takes three forevers for it to recognize a USB thumbdrive and enable copying to/from it, so I just use the CF slot instead. Yes, I did try other thumbdrives and even to format them in FAT16, and it didn't help.  The 900C does not have native WiFi. If connectivity is essential you'll need a compatible PCMCIA WiFi modem card. I have one for mine, an old 3Com card of some description, but it's too vintage to understand WPA and will only connect to open and WEP-protected networks (WEP has been cracked so open as to make it little more than a nuisance for anyone wanting to leech a WiFi hotspot). There isn't very much you can do on it if you do get it connected, though; you can IRC and SSH, but anything involving graphics - even something as light as Wikipedia - takes bloody ages to load. Text browsers will work, but today's media-rich Internet is basically unusable in text-only form.  The 900C can run Linux - there's a port of JLime that supports it - but there's very little reason to make it do so. Text editing can be done just as well in WinCE, and for everything else the JLime port is in a very early version without much functionality. Critically, it lacks any sleep mode - it can only be on or off, so you'd have to boot it from WinCE every time you wanted to use it. Needless to say, the port has been unmaintained and undeveloped for a long time."

Thanks for the info there, TIL!  And it's awesome to know that because they're absolutely solid, while they can have slight issues, their solidness means a case of ""yeah, there's this minor issue over here"" is very unlikely to become ""<X> happened to it so be really careful or you'll break it,"" as in the case with my MC218 (which sits in a drawer because I have nothing specific that calls specifically for that particular device). :)  I'll be sure to see if I can get a 900C with its original stylus. I'll admit I've learned to appreciate resistive touchscreens, FWIW: I hand-drew some font glyphs on my MC218, besides screen mockups and other technical-drawing type things, in its paint program. And I've still got my stylus, although it scratched the screen in a couple of places once because the plastic had a microscopic dag on it >.>  I also have to admit the CF slot was my primary data transfer method, mostly because it was either that or RS232 or IrDA ;P And the USB host sounds technically interesting; it might be educational to to load up the USB mass storage profile on a FaceDancer (a (sliiiightly expensive) hardware go-betweeen that makes Python code on Computer #2 look like a real USB device to Computer #1) and trace the back-and-forth. *shrugs*  Hmm. As for Wi-Fi, probably the best idea I can come up with is modding a TP-Link TL-MR10U into a MAC-locked Wi-Fi repeater. It'd probably be much easier than expected to implement.  Browsing-wise, perhaps that WinCE port of NetSurf I was talking about earlier wouldn't be out of order!  And Linux for the MC218 is, to me, kind of cool, and I was genuinely intrigued and impressed with the speed of Linux 2.4 on a 30MHz ARM processor - although I didn't really go as far as getting a complete X setup working (although I did successfully fire the server up... then go round in circles trying to kill it =P)... mostly because the interest was mostly novelty. There's some practicality there, but not enough to say, completely switch over. I imagine that if my device were not so fragile I'd be using a 70/30 ratio of EPOC to Linux, though, so it's nice the 900C has a JLime port, and I expect I'd get at least some use out of it."
vintagecomputing,2zc754,dansdata,1 point,Tue Mar 24 19:30:07 2015 UTC,"MAC locking is super-easy to spoof, though. Assuming your primary modem/router has Ethernet, I'd just connect a secondary router to it and have it create another hotspot (WEP-protected because it's better than nothing). Turn it on when you need the 900C online, turn it off when you're done.  I doubt you'll get any use out of JLime on the 900C, though, unless you're willing to update the port yourself."

vintagecomputing,2zc754,ahandle,2,Sat Mar 21 19:47:19 2015 UTC,"The Alphasmart Dana is apparently beautiful to type on, it runs Palm OS, its (giant) monochrome screen is backlit, and it has Wi-Fi. I could almost do horrible things to the people who built the Dana for not making a foldable version as well. :D   I'm big on vintage writing machines because they offer a proper distraction-free environment, so I acquired a Dana cheaply a couple years ago. Let me tell you, it's not a good device.  It has three big problems and several minor ones. Big problem number 1 is that it's an ergonomic nightmare. The screen isn't hinged and lies almost flat; to use it without the entire world reflecting on it and the characters washing out into unreadability you need to look at it almost top-down. This tires your neck in no time flat, and if you're like me the position eventually makes you drowsy and unproductive. The Dana ads showed people using it in various other ""I got an awesome idea and I must write it down NOW"" positions, but how they achieved that is known only to them, as the keyboard can't be used well in anything other than the standard flat position.  Number 2 is that the software sucks. AlphaWord would be good enough if it read plain text files, but it doesn't - everything needs to be converted to be read on the PC, then converted back to be edited again on the Dana. The print-out-as-a-keyboard feature is neat, but only works one way and requires the en-us keyboard layout to be active on the PC or it'll make a mess.  There's a version of CardTXT that's hacked to work on the Dana's wider screen (or to put it better, there was, but vanished from the Internet, and only reappeared when I re-hacked it and /u/dansdata put it online on his blog); it's a good editor and understands txt files, but it's additional software, and as such goes away if your battery happens to discharge. Then you're left with a lot of txt files on the SD card that you can no longer read until you reach a properly set-up computer on which you can perform a hotsync that'll reinstall CardTXT.  Problem number 3 is that the entire OS sucks. PalmOS is a bitmap-driven system; this is fine for most PDA tasks, which is why nobody (who hadn't bought a foldable keyboard...) complained about it back when Palm PDAs were a thing. But the combo of a bitmap-driven interface and a slow processor causes the entire OS to choke on editing more than a small amount of text. It gets slow, and if you're a fast typist you find yourself waiting on the thing to finish your sentences all the goddamned time. It must be how people who had to use 300-baud modems felt during the dark beginnings of the web.  It's especially annoying because text editing is computationally extremely cheap, but the process is so hamstrung by the OS that it ends up being an exercise in frustration.  All in all, the Dana is a poor choice for everything and a badly thought-out device from the get-go, with a PDA system that limits its usefulness as a text-entry device but a size too big to be used as a PDA."
vintagecomputing,2zc754,d75,2,Sun Mar 22 12:59:32 2015 UTC,"Hello! :-)  I actually just use the built-in Dana AlphaWord app, because all I want to do is hammer in moderate amounts of text at a moment's notice, with no editing, and then squirt it into a computer by plugging in the USB cable and pressing the Send button. No moving of text from the outside world to the Dana; just creation of plain ASCII on the Dana, and moving it to a PC.  For this one narrow purpose, the Dana is great. Clearly better than most if not all of the other impact-resistant-mailbox-screen-decent-keyboard-long-AA-battery-life-text-entry-computers. Which you'd expect, of course, because one of the best of those remains the portable TRS-80! (This market segment is not exactly a hotly-contested one.)  No, the screen is not ""giant"". I mean, it's physically pretty big in area compared with a smartphone, but it has miserably low resolution and terrible green-on-grey-green contrast and a lousy backlight that chomps down the battery and... Just don't read stuff on it. I read stuff on a Palm III back in the day; it was at the time unquestionably the best pocket-sized thing on which you could read stuff. But it was shit. The Dana has three-point-something Palm III screens side-by-side. It's still pretty shit. You can do quick edits by poking the touchscreen with your fingernail and typing, and that's really quite handy for small stuff, but actually doing the full process of writing just on that screen? Please, no.  To get around the crappy screen and slow response, you should just type an asterisk or two at every point that'll need editing, and fix it on your proper computer later.  If this sounds like the most awesome device you can possibly imagine, then drop big bucks on a Dana on eBay. If it sounds moderately useful - which it is to me - then fire up your sniping software and see if you can get one for cheap."

Also, mpeg-1 vcd might be the best format also i think?  e: i'm not sure for apple btw, the older codecs like sorenson and intel indeo were less resource intensive i think. Not sure though.  e2: cinepack codec could even play on 12.5Mhz motorola 68k i read on wikipedia (also, single speed cdrom without using xa-mode (no error correction, like an audio cd and vcd) is 150KB/sec. vcd is (1150+224)/8 ~ 172KB but that's without error correction and maybe that account for the extra bitrate). I do know these cinepack video's were very blocky/poor framerate/small size(smaller then cif) and mpeg-1 was a big improvement. For most computers however there were add-on cards with mpeg decoders to play vcd's but it depends on what you want to be able to support. If there is a software mpeg-1 player for the platforms you want to support i'd  try that first."

The 486 and 68020 machines were generally the baseline spec back in the day, so that means Cinepak video at roughly 150-300kbyes/sec with 8-bit 22khz ADPCM audio. Don't expect high resolution video. It was often postage stamp video resolutions like 240x120/320x240 at 15fps.   See http://www.synack.net/~bbraun/68kvideo.html for more details.    If you're targeting the Pentium or PPC your codec options start to open up quite a bit; Intel Indeo, MPEG1 and Sorensen are all options with much better audio (16-bit stereo at 44khz and likely some better compression).   Another option might be the old RealVideo formats. I remember that running on 68k and PPC macs as well as win16 and early win32. You might get slightly better quality, as if memory serves right, they were basically highly optimized h263 codecs."

Even mpeg1 used to require dedicated hardware decoders back then.   Older codecs used to measure Kbytes/sec rather than Kbits/sec of modern codecs.  Don't forget that your audio tracks will soak a fair chunk of your data rate, especially uncompressed PCM - so you'll need to factor that in to your calculation. Using ADPCM or dropping your sample rate and channels down will help, but there were other compressors whose names I forget that were common then also (I wanna say ulaw but honest can't remember)."

vintagecomputing,2yw7ik,Robotman1974,2,Sat Mar 14 03:55:41 2015 UTC,"Yes, it's a good idea to match the computer to a TV from the same technology or time period. An older TV will deliver a more authentic experience in many ways, as that's what the Exidy designers were aiming at.   but they might not accept the video signal because the display resolution is too low.   Can't figure out what you could possibly mean by this. NTSC resolution means what? The number of horizontal lines is well-defined, and you can quibble about the B/W and color resolution within a line. A modern digital flat-panel TV is going to resample the analog and convert it to what it wants to display."
vintagecomputing,2yw7ik,jfoust2,2,Sat Mar 14 15:34:10 2015 UTC,"This isn't from personal experience, but from what I've read about hooking up old video game consoles to newer TVs.  Many new TVs simply won't accept the signal from an older console like a Super Nintendo or Nintendo 64 (320 x 240 progressive resolution).  These TVs give an error message despite their ability to upscale something like 640 x 480 interlaced scan resolution.  This is where custom upscalers like the XRGB-mini Framemeister come into the picture, but I agree, a CRT is the much better choice.  edit: mixed up progressive & interlaced"
vintagecomputing,2yw7ik,Robotman1974,1 point,Sat Mar 14 16:35:51 2015 UTC,"I believe your anecdote could be true for other reasons, but NTSC is NTSC. Those game consoles put out NTSC. There's no ""resolution"" there apart from scan lines and how much you can stuff within the NTSC spec, which differs for color and mono. So why would some newer flat-panel TVs not handle the kind of NTSC emitted by older consoles? Is the signal not quite up to spec?"
vintagecomputing,2yw7ik,jfoust2,1 point,Sun Mar 15 18:33:57 2015 UTC,"I don't have any idea about the reason behind it, especially whether or not an NTSC, PAL, or SECAM signal makes a difference.  I'm getting this info from seeing many questions pop up on various retro-gaming subreddits over the years.  People have trouble hooking up old hardware to their TVs, and the problem seems to be that some newer TVs just won't accept a signal if the display resolution is too low.  Here are some examples of what I'm talking about:  https://www.reddit.com/r/retrogaming/comments/259k71/curious_about_upscalers/  https://www.reddit.com/r/retrogaming/comments/2u8odw/need_help_hooking_nes_to_samsung_plasma/  https://www.reddit.com/r/snes/comments/wm02b/i_am_trying_to_hook_up_my_snes_to_my_new_hdtv_but/  The common problem in those threads is that the newer TVs just won't display the 240p signal.  And like I said, I really don't know why that is.  This discussion on the Nintendo tech forums has a bit more information, especially the response from TRONIC-808.  This gets me back to another reason why a CRT is a much better choice anyway.  Modern TVs don't upscale computer graphics properly.  The upscalers they use are meant to make movies and TV shows look better when upscaled.  When these algorithms are applied to raster graphics, they look really, really bad.  edit:  Found a very good explanation of the whole issue, with a compatibility list for newer TVs that shows which ones are capable of displaying a 240p signal."
vintagecomputing,2yw7ik,Robotman1974,1 point,Sun Mar 15 19:14:27 2015 UTC,"The Wikipedia article on ""low definition television"" says :   Older video game consoles and home computers generated a nonstandard NTSC or PAL signal which sent a single field type which prevented fields from interlacing.[1][2] This is equivalent to 240p and 288p respectively, and was used due to requiring less resources and producing a progressive and stable signal.   The HDRetrovision article says 240p trick was accomplished by a ""special timing signal"" but doesn't explain it in detail. I'd love to see a NTSC-spec-level explanation of how they did that."
vintagecomputing,2yw7ik,jfoust2,1 point,Mon Mar 16 14:06:16 2015 UTC,"Ah, the old ""if it works, just ship it anyway"".  Makes sense for newer TV makers then to conform only to standards and not concern themselves with the way old hardware did things three decades earlier."
vintagecomputing,2yw7ik,Robotman1974,1 point,Mon Mar 16 15:12:34 2015 UTC,"there's not too much to 240p really, just a difference in the sync signal. On a CRT TV, the interlace was added by actually adding a half line, then retracing early so the picture would get offset by 1/2 of a line's vertical space. to do 240p, you leave this half-line out. thus you get 262 scanlines (240 visible) on NTSC at roughly 60 frames per second, or you can get 525 scanlines (480 visible) at roughly 60 fields per second, each field being one half-frame at 262.5 scanlines each.  For the record, I've never had a TV which didn't support 240p, but I haven't had too many TV's."
vintagecomputing,2yw7ik,jzatarski,1 point,Mon Mar 16 17:11:22 2015 UTC,"Upon more research, I believe ""240p"" has every frame begin with the odd field vertical sync.

vintagecomputing,2yw7ik,jfoust2,1 point,Mon Mar 16 19:00:59 2015 UTC,"yes, during the 'even' field, you add the half line, and during the odd, you do not. A vertical retrace resets everything and adding the half line offsets the display vertically by one half line."

I doubt you'd be able to find a typewriter that can do much better than 30 characters per second (equivalent to a 300 baud connection).  a 300 baud connection was way better than no connection at all, but it didn't take long to discover just how slow it was.  a full 80x24 screen of text took a minute to display at 300 baud.  you can bump the speed up to 1200 baud if you can find something like a DEC LA120, which used a dot-matrix printhead rather than a type wheel, ball or box."

The forms of practical capacitors vary widely, but all contain at least two electrical conductors (plates) separated by a dielectric (i.e. insulator). The conductors can be thin films, foils or sintered beads of metal or conductive electrolyte, etc. The nonconducting dielectric acts to increase the capacitor's charge capacity. A dielectric can be glass, ceramic, plastic film, air, vacuum, paper, mica, oxide layer etc. Capacitors are widely used as parts of electrical circuits in many common electrical devices. Unlike a resistor, an ideal capacitor does not dissipate energy. Instead, a capacitor stores energy in the form of an electrostatic field between its plates.

vintagecomputing,2xjmed,King_Corduroy,2,Sun Mar 1 07:53:03 2015 UTC,"to simplify things, you should probably remove the things that you don't know what they are.  the Logitech card (probably a bus mouse card) can come out if you don't have a bus mouse to plug into it.  if the system originally came with an MDA, CGA or EGA card then that should come out too if you're going to use VGA instead.  also, remove the hardcard temporarily.  you can put it back in later when you're ready to start looking at it.  you will need to remove the disk controller card and figure out what kind it is, it will probably be either MFM or RLL.  an MFM-formatted disk will have 17 sectors per track, RLL raises it to 26.  when choosing the drive type, combine the cylinders/heads/wpcomp numbers from the drive with the sectors value from the controller.  it is not uncommon to find an MFM drive that has been formatted as RLL, so you can't rely 100% on the drive manufacturer's spec.  for example, the ST-225 (20MB) and ST-238 (30MB) were the same drive, except that the latter was factory-certified for RLL formatting, but in practice you could usually format an ST-225 using RLL as well, which meant that you could convert a 20MB drive into a 30MB drive simply by switching your disk controller.  I'm pretty sure I had a Mitsubishi MR-535 myself at one point, and it's very likely that I was using it as a 60MB drive with an RLL controller, although it's been a long time and I don't remember for sure.  presumably the drive was already formatted when its original owner disposed of it, so you shouldn't need to low-level format it again.  if you move an MFM or RLL drive from one controller to another, you might need to low-level format it again because slight timing variations made moving a drive between different controllers unreliable.  this means, if the drive doesn't work after you get the drive parameters set up properly, it may simply be because the drive has failed due to age.  this might be why the machine was disposed of in the first place.  at that point you might as well try doing a low-level format again, but to do all that you will need the appropriate software on diskette.  if you are interested in recovering whatever data or programs were already on the drive, then doing this will be a last resort because a low-level format will make everything previously on the drive unrecoverable (at least, unrecoverable by you).  to use software from diskette, you'll need to set your floppy drive type in CMOS.  PC's from that time do not auto-detect the presence of a floppy drive (and in particular, do not auto-detect what type of drive it is) so you will need to explicitly configure this in the CMOS setup.  a beige drive would typically be 1.2MB (but not always), to be certain whether it's a 1.2MB or a 360KB drive check the drive model number.  TEAC FD-55B is a 360KB drive, FD-55GF is 1.2MB.  for other types check here."

vintagecomputing,2w8zis,MeatPiston,2,Wed Feb 18 01:53:52 2015 UTC,Yeah. From what I remember those NVRAMs held factory settings including things like the MAC address.  Lose your NVRAM and boom.

In general, if you don't cut the flyback wire or disconnect it from the tube, you won't get horrendously zapped.  The high voltage is required in the tube to propel electrons toward the screen.  That said, there can also be line voltage capacitors present inside, but many of these style monitors use a step down transformer so actually nothing on the main board should be dangerous."

It uses tiny magnetic toroids (rings), the cores, through which wires are threaded to write and read information. Each core represents one bit of information. The cores can be magnetized in two different ways (clockwise or counterclockwise) and the bit stored in a core is zero or one depending on that core's magnetization direction. The wires are arranged to allow an individual core to be set to either a ""one"" or a ""zero"", and for its magnetization to be changed, by sending appropriate electric current pulses through selected wires. The process of reading the core causes the core to be reset to a ""zero"", thus erasing it. This is called destructive readout.    Image i - A 32 x 32 core memory plane storing 1024 bits of data.

Most dialers support custom scripts or a manual mode that lets you send commands to the modem directly  From what I remember you send one modem the ""ata"" command and the other the ""atd"" command. Do it at roughly the same time on both ends and they should handshake and connect up  Used to do this when I was a kid to play doom.

The PCI bus will let you use a hefty graphics card for the era.  You will be able to do a lot with DOS and old ISA cards: 10 MB Ethernet, SoundBlaster, etc.   When you tire of the 90s, put CP/M-86 on that thing and step back a decade.

vintagecomputing,2pd6d8,ahandle,2,Fri Dec 19 16:34:59 2014 UTC,"That's kind of a loaded question.  What you looking for is the use of a terminal vs. a teletype for I/O.  IBM had started using terminals in the 60s for their screen-based data entry with 3270s.  It's a standard that's still with us today due to the efficient use of bandwidth that allows a large number of terminals with minimal processing overhead to service them.  Outside of the data entry usage, programs were still done on punched cards using an 026 keypunch machine to make the cards.   Printers were used for final reporting of datasets created by the punch-card programs.  These are better described as batch-process programming interfaces.  As far as interactive interface programming and administration of systems, that's something we can thank the DEC PDP series for.  They did all their communication in character-at-a-time input (as opposed to IBMs ""screen at a time"" input) via serial interfaces that connected to teletypes. This interactive style of commanding the processor may be more what you're thinking of as far as the transition of paper-based to screen-based work.  You could easily go through a ton of paper in an extended session listing out programs or directories.  That and teletypes were SLOW and NOISY.  They only ran at 110 characters per second usually.  That's about 1/3 the pace that you can read a line of text.  In the early 70s the development of the ""TV Typewriter"" by hobbists sped up acceptance of using terminals (aka ""glass teletypes"") over then-typical teletype printers, interfaced either via direct connection or via modem.  The TTL chip revolution of the early 70s made it trivially inexpensive to make your own silent TV Typewriter that would connect to your TV and not have to have expensive teletypes that burn through pricey paper and/or keep everyone awake with noisy teletypes hammering away while you did your work.    In fact, Woz himself was inspired by the idea of creating his own TV Typewriter in his design of the Apple I.  And thus started the movement of making video and graphics  an integrated part of a computer as opposed to an extension of a terminal hanging off a serial port.  Read ""Hackers"" by Stephen Levy for some in-depth history on terminals."

vintagecomputing,2ngof9,ido,2,Wed Nov 26 20:12:57 2014 UTC,"haha no there is no sound you need to listen. I don't generally speak in my videos because my voice is annoying.  I would say Windows 2000 is moderately difficult to get running. I kept getting a BSoD during installation until I tried it with Turbo off. Now THAT was painful. It took about 12 hours to install  No hacks are required because it doesn't use CPU detection at least.  After installation it is stable with Turbo on so it must be some quirk. I am running the cache timings extremely tight so the system is not absolutely 100% stable under all circumstances but once Win2K is running, crashes are almost unheard of. Every once in a while I get an ""Illegal operation"" in Win9x but it is very rare.  Don't get caught watching youtube/reddit at work ;)"
vintagecomputing,2ngof9,ido,2,Wed Nov 26 20:42:13 2014 UTC,I would also like to mention this 486 has a PCI USB card
vintagecomputing,2ngof9,thedangerman007,3,Thu Nov 27 02:20:30 2014 UTC,I could only get my 486 to play a single channel of an MP3 file back in 97. This is impressive.
vintagecomputing,2ngof9,mindbleach,3,Wed Nov 26 14:30:38 2014 UTC,My 486 plays 128Kbps mono or 96Kbps stereo (barely) with Winplay3. It is all about the software you choose.

vintagecomputing,2ngof9,FreonTrip,3,Wed Nov 26 13:54:21 2014 UTC,"Well basically CF cards use IDE protocol so it is a passive adapter that converts the IDE plug to a CF card slot. There are many different types of them available.  I hope I can link ebay (http://www.ebay.com/itm/40-Pin-CF-To-IDE-Compact-Flash-Card-Adapter-Bootable-/190414002687)  I use one like that where it uses a expansion slot on in the back so I don't need to open the case in order to swap cards.  Advantages are that they are cheap, fast (1mS seek time), easy to back up as an image on another machine and I  can swap OSes as easily while maintaining a clean single-boot environment."
vintagecomputing,2neon1,ArduinoPatridge,6,Tue Nov 25 20:38:33 2014 UTC,What I kind of miss are the laptops with expansion bays you could swap out between batteries or drives.  Some laptops with a battery in each slot could get over 10 hours.

Do you really want to have this thing dial up to the internet over POTS? Or, are you just looking for any way to connect it to the internet? If it's the first, you're really going to have to find an early 90's real modem, all modems made since the introduction of ""winmodems"" off load all the heavy lifting of modeming (the modulation and demodulation of the signal) to the main CPU. If you just want to connect it to the internet, the easiest way is to build a null modem cable and hook it up to a unixish box that has the serial line SLIP or PPP stuff installed and use Trumpet Winsock."

All I really want is to get it online, so I'm going to try using a RasPi as the modem.  I might even rig it up to play the infamous dial up noise on connect."
vintagecomputing,2mm4sv,Meathe,2,Tue Nov 18 18:55:22 2014 UTC,"A project I've got on my ""someday/maybe"" list is to create a simulated phone line by attaching a VoIP FXS interface to a RasPi or similar, and then expose a local shell or telnet client to the local system.    I want to do this because I've got a bunch of modems for a lot of my classic systems that don't use RS-232, but connect directly to the system's expansion bus, including a Commodore Vicmodem and an Atari SIO-bus modem.  I actually didn't used to have any way of interfacing my Atari 8-bits to my modern PCs, so I used to dial into a shell account to do it.

It also offers a lot of build targets - DOS, Win 3.x, 98, 2000, XP, Novell Netware, OS/2.    With regards to the modem, if you don't have a POTS line (plain old telephone system), it's not going to work.  Digital phone lines are optimized for voice, and just don't work well with data.  If you can, install MS-Internet explorer 3.02a and the y2k patch, Ie302y2k.exe), which came with a bunch of inf files for WinModems.

The only thing that worries me about this method is that the article talks about BBSes, whereas I'm looking for Internet, but I'm sure there's not much difference in setup.  Cheers.

vintagecomputing,2m0cn6,SenorCheaposGato,2,Tue Nov 11 22:08:11 2014 UTC,"Thanks for the pictures and magical moments they provided :-)  However, here are a few explanations for interested parties.   Image 11: I have no idea why the icons are arranged like this.   They represent the F keys. F3, F7 and F9 are either unavailable on this model or completely, and on first sight it looks like the icons are randomly placed :-)   Image 14: I have to be honest--I have no idea what these settings do. Since I have no way to get it online anyway I didn't bother to look it up in the manual.   These are modem settings. Speed (1200 bits per second or bps, that's 0,0012 Mbps for the youngsters around here), bit parity (the ""language"" that the two modems are talking, so that they can understand each other), next two are self explanatory.    Theoretically, you can get it online. You can dial in with the laptop into a modern computer with a modem (directly connected, ATD and ATH anyone?), and the modern computer would share it's internet connection. The rest is easy, just get the proper network stack and a DOS text web browser (I'm presuming this is a PC-XT compatible).  I know I did that with a 1993 Compaq. It did boast a 386 and 4 megs of RAM, though."
vintagecomputing,2m0cn6,antena,2,Wed Nov 12 15:42:04 2014 UTC,"Thanks for the explanation! I feel the need to put in a disclaimer that I am in fact old enough to have used dial-up, I just never had to mess with any settings. My first computer had an internal 14.4k modem, and I think I actually have an external modem kicking around the house somewhere.  I'm glad you enjoyed the pictures--I was amazed when I found it and got it booted up. I should probably try to make some copies of the boot disk just in case--it only has the one boot disk, and I'm amazed that it didn't get corrupted at some point in the last 25-28 years. I figure it may have actually helped to not have any other floppies stored with it.  Edit to ask you a question: I only have 1.44MB floppies at home--will they work with this? If not, I found some tape drive cassettes and floppies in another office, and those might be old enough to work. Thanks for your help, kind (and knowledgeable) stranger!"
vintagecomputing,2m0cn6,antena,2,Thu Nov 13 03:28:26 2014 UTC,"Yes, you can use 1.44MB floppies. You might know this, but for sake of completeness, I'll ELI5, no offence meant :-)    To ensure compatibility, notice the difference between 720k and 1.44M floppies on this picture. Notice how 720k floppy only has one ""hole"" (the one for making the disk read only), and how 1.44M floppy has two (one for read-only mode, the second so that the drive can detect the capacity.  Now you can modify your floppy disk like this and proceed to format the floppy as a native 720k.    As I understand it, the 1986 IBM PC Convertible you have does not support 1.44M floppies, and theoretically it should treat them as 720k regardless. But you do need to format them to 720k, and because it's easy, I recommend you tape up the 1.44M detection hole, especially if you will use the disk on a more modern computer besides the convertible one."
vintagecomputing,2m0cn6,Kallocain,2,Thu Nov 13 12:25:27 2014 UTC,"No offense taken--I appreciate the advice! I made 2 copies today with no problems. I also realized that I'm missing some disks, including (I think) the actual setup disk. The one I have that's labeled as such seems to actually be the Application/Selector disk that you have to create after startup. I'm also missing the modem setup disk, which is too bad.  Oddly, I'm also missing some options on the Tools screen. All the F keys should have actions assigned, but some things just don't show up, including Disk Format. Fortunately, it automatically formats disks during the copy process. I was hoping that the actual setup disk would allow me to wipe and run the Explorer program to set it up fresh and maybe restore the missing functions, but no dice.

With the proprietary format of the expansion capabilities of the machine, and issues with wireless keyboard (which was innovative at the time), this system really didn't take off like it should have.  It introduced some really great innovations which pushed PC gaming - like the 16 color capabilities, and the 3 voice sound though.  Tandy really pulled all the good stuff from the PCjr, and made an affordable version with better expandability in the Tandy 1000 line after that, and the PCjr died a pretty quick death.  King's Quest I think was first developed with the PCJr in mind as well - which really was a turning point for Sierra taking off in the PC industry."

Jack Tramiel had synthesized a very angry rivalry between the engineers at Moorpark and MOS. The Moorpark prototype (which was more functionally refined but less so physically) that Feagens claims is the ""real"" Vic-20 prototype was supposedly rejected by Jack, who was under the impression that the MOS prototype was ready to ship. He was also a bit ticked that Chuck Peddle's Moorepark team wasn't doing what he told them to do – – not work on his small color computer, but design an Apple II killer.  What eventually became the Vic-20 was the MOS prototype, heavily modified by Bob Russell with assistance from John Feagans and Bill Seiler at Moorpark.   Bottom line: to claim that either prototype was the ""real prototype"" is a little disingenuous. In the end, it was what some would describe as a reluctant amalgamation of both.  No offense to John, whom I don't know personally. But it would not be unreasonable to suspect that, to this day, there is a little bitterness between the two factions leading to animosity."

vintagecomputing,2k6dgt,Ramin_HAL9001,1 point,Fri Oct 24 08:25:55 2014 UTC,"Just thinking out loud here, I can't quite figure out the pixel throughput. We need a general idea of how quickly to pulse each voltage value for each pixel as the CRT lines scan across the screen.  2000 characters, 80 width, 25 height  Each character is 14 pixels tall, or 15 if there was a horizontal gap between each character, so either 14 times 25 = 350, or 15 times 25 = 375 pixels tall.  Each character is 9 pixels wide, or 10 if there was a vertical gap between each character, with 80 columns, that is either 720 or 800 pixels width.  Lets assume there were no gaps between characters, just a plain 720 x 350 pixel display, that gives you 252000 pixels per frame.  At a rate of 50 frames per second (given by the horizontal refresh rate), 252000 times 50 = 12,600,000 pixels per second.  Looking at the horizontal refresh rate, 18432 lines per second horizontal refresh rate with 720 pixels per line 720 times 18432 times every second.  720 pixels times 18432 lines per second = 13,271,040 pixels per second, which is more than what I calculate using pixels times refresh rate of 12,600,000 pixels per second. The numbers are close, but I don't know why they are not equal.  Still, better than 12.6 million pixels per second is a pretty high throughput.  It is a TTL digital device, so I am guessing the voltage levels are between 0 and 5 volts, and you are allowed 4 intensity values per pixel, so:  0 = 0 volts  1 = 1.66 volts  2 = 3.33 volts  3 = 5 volts  But I could be totally wrong about that.  Finally, there are horizontal and vertical sync pins. That probably means the monitor sends a pulse on the horizontal sync pin every time a line is has completed drawing, and a pulse every time the screen has completed drawing on the vertical sync pin. Your analog output can use this to more accurately time the pixel pulse frequency."

Even the dreamcast couldn't read them unless you opened it up and turned an adjustment pot (possibly running the laser beyond spec if that's what it adjusted).  Also make sure you don't use multisession at all (even if disc is closed).  It needs to be all burned in one go or the drive might not find the table of contents.  Disc-at-once or track-at-once or sector-at-once is okay as long as it's not multi-session.  700MB discs will work but it's possible some old drives may not read past 650MB (just don't fill it past that).  Of course name your files in 8.3 format or you could have an entertaining time trying to figure out which is which."

vintagecomputing,2jg9kz,fsckit,1 point,Thu Oct 16 23:34:25 2014 UTC,I've got a 1x creative drive (anyone remember disc caddys?) that will but it's very picky about formatting... if it isn't recorded the same way as a pressed disc you're screwed.  Not to mention the problems finding drivers... linux at one time had a working driver (I think it's even still in the kernel sources) but at one point a crashing bug got introduced and it's pretty worthless unless you go back quite a few years.  It was enough to kinda play audio CDs though.

vintagecomputing,2jg9kz,bradn,1 point,Sat Oct 18 17:16:23 2014 UTC,Yes the CDs should work. The main problem is the drive and if it still works. Do you have a spare idea drive? Something newer?
vintagecomputing,2jg9kz,Jim-Jones,1 point,Thu Oct 16 20:49:19 2014 UTC,"Did you mean ""IDE"" drive? I haven't actually opened the 486 yet to see, but I'm almost certain it is IDE. It's 2-speed, if that makes a difference to how I should burn for it.  Do you think if I took a 52x CD-RW drive out of a more modern computer, and installed it in a DOS environment as the CR-ROM Reader, using the OAKCDROM.SYS driver, it might work?  I think I'll take one with me anyway just so I have more options when I head out there next."
vintagecomputing,2jg9kz,Jim-Jones,1 point,Thu Oct 16 21:40:56 2014 UTC,"Yeah the oak driver should be fine.  Use caution if the drive was plugged in a sound card and not a normal IDE port - it might have been one of the weird connectors before they standardized on IDE cdroms.  If the BIOS is old it might not have a setting for cdrom in the IDE config - you might be able to do all-zeros geometry (0 cylinders, 0 heads, 0 sectors, etc), or 1 for a spot if it doesn't allow 0.  You can try ""disabled"" but I'm not sure if oakcdrom.sys will find it or not then.  Linux doesn't care about the bios config but I can't remember if the DOS drivers did."
vintagecomputing,2jg9kz,Jim-Jones,1 point,Fri Oct 17 03:20:45 2014 UTC,"You're right, the current BIOS doesn't have a setting for CD-ROM drives. The computer is from around 1992.  The ""Auto-detect Hard Drive"" function finds the hard drive easily (about a 250 MB HDD), and leaves the second spot as all zeroes.  The CONFIG.SYS uses a driver I hadn't seen before. Probably from the manufacturer of the CD-ROM.  Really, I just need to head out to the farm (where this computer is) and play some more with all your advice in mind."

I have no idea what your TV has but American TVs tend to have either screw terminals for an external antenna (which means we needed a switch box like this one: http://www.videogameconsolelibrary.com/images/articles/mg-av/RF-1.jpg).

The connector is called a barrel connector. The center polarity is negative and the inner diameter is 2.5mm.  About the power supply: it has to be 9 volts but the power supply amperage (the 1.4 part) can be rated higher (like 1.5 or 2 amps).   This power supply would work for you: http://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/UNIVERSAL-AC-DC-ADAPTOR-PLUG-POWER-SUPPLY-1500MA-1-5A-3V-4-5V-6V-7-5V-9V-12V-USB-/121157262431"
vintagecomputing,2j6s7k,factus10,1 point,Tue Oct 14 11:47:42 2014 UTC,That power supply appears to be regulated DC so wouldn't work. The spectrum requires unregulated DC to drive the maskable interrupt and timing signals for the display. But the rest of what you said looks spot on

vintagecomputing,2j6s7k,CallMeDonk,1 point,Wed Oct 15 01:20:19 2014 UTC,"Unregulated 9 Volt DC. Interestingly the unregulated part is important as the spectrum takes the 50hz uk mains or 60hz us mains signal to generate the maskable interrupt used in drawing the screen and reading the keyboard. Without that you would be left with a blank white screen IIRC.  The RF leads from a super nintendo will work just fine. Also bear in mind when it says channel 35, it justs means the frequency of the signal in RF and not the television channel. IFAIK the super nintendo also used the same channel. So if your tele is tuned to your snes, it should also be tuned to the spectrum more or less. You might need to fine tune to get a clearer picture tho  Also check out World of Spectrum as it's a fantastic resource."
