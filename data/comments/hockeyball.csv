hockeyball,3b8tlj,ZebishopREVO,5,Sat Jun 27 12:16:51 2015 UTC,"Several years ago Toronto traded two future firsts and a second to the Bruins for Phil Kessel.   Toronto ended up sucking so bad that one of the picks turned into Tyler Seguin, one of the best players in the league the past few years.   Then a highly touted defenceman, Dougie Hamilton, dropped to the B's the next year with Toronto's other pick and he ended up progressing to be a top-pairing defenceman, a type of player that's extremely hard to find.  A few years ago, Boston traded Seguin to Dallas because he was partying too much for pieces that haven't panned out like they were supposed to and Seguin just got better - way better.  Then yesterday, the Bruins decided to trade Hamilton to Calgary because they can't afford him in the future. The plan was to use the picks they got in this trade to get Noah Hanifin - a similar franchise defenceman. Arizona decided not to trade and Boston was left with the picks. The pick they got for Hamilton they used on a guy who was projected to go in the second round.  The Islanders and Jets then proceeded to take projected top line players right after Boston's string of picks they used on lesser-ranked players."

Apparently Holland may have promised him a contract for the coming year as well. He has no natural body parts below his thighs and would only play 10 games this season at most. He scored one goal all last season. He's just like a tumor: sticking around and taking up a roster spot and cap space.

hockeyball,35aag6,angelsil,3,Fri May 8 15:28:48 2015 UTC,"That's a silly thing to ask. I don't think Crawford is in the realm of Price or Lundqvist, but he makes the saves he needs to for Chicago to win. When you can score on command, it makes having an elite goalie less vital.   ...  I miss scoring on command :-("
hockeyball,35aag6,Mr_Abe_Froman,4,Fri May 8 15:35:19 2015 UTC,It's just sometimes the defense lets him down and then people chime in with the trading Crawford comments. Mostly on Facebook pages. At least the defense has been working hard recently.

hockeyball,33bl7r,btownbomb,2,Tue Apr 21 20:24:55 2015 UTC,Is Ott disliked by a lot of people? I have a bias but I could see how he'd be obnoxious to play against
hockeyball,33bl7r,Circumstantial_Law,3,Wed Apr 22 22:30:19 2015 UTC,"I think after the last game, Wild fans have started to hate him.  He missed a check near the boards and faked a punch at Dumba sitting on the bench, he made a big clean check on Scandella... before cross checking him twice, and tackling Spurgeon right after.  He was patting Scandella (I think) on the head during a stoppage in play.  It is mostly just trying to get in peoples head, but it's a bit obnoxious, and has put him fairly high on the list of disliked players in MN (probably behind 2003 Bertuzzi)."

hockeyball,32kumy,wmcduff,5,Wed Apr 15 00:42:00 2015 UTC,I think the Hamburglar mask is pretty much canon on Ottawa at this point. :)
hockeyball,32kumy,Shwinky,2,Tue Apr 14 18:56:27 2015 UTC,"Yeah I agree. Hey, /u/CaptainButtGrabber! Two things:     Great name. Think you could edit the Sensball to have a hamburglar mask?"
hockeyball,32kumy,Shwinky,9,Wed Apr 15 01:04:23 2015 UTC,Thanks! How's this
hockeyball,32kumy,Shwinky,1 point,Wed Apr 15 01:10:20 2015 UTC,Thumbs up. Or upvote.
hockeyball,32kumy,Shwinky,1 point,Wed Apr 15 01:14:12 2015 UTC,"Looks beautiful! Only thing I might suggest is try adding bands that go around the head to hold it against its face like the Actual Hamburglar's mask, but that's your call. Whichever one you think looks best!    EDIT: Here's a quickly slapped together mock-up so you don't have to do it yourself to compare!"
hockeyball,32kumy,Zaungast,3,Wed Apr 15 01:18:09 2015 UTC,"I made this, then saw your edit"
hockeyball,32kumy,Zaungast,1 point,Wed Apr 15 01:22:36 2015 UTC,Lol. Well yours looks a lot cleaner than mine. :P Paint.NET is terrible (And I'm not that artistic either). I personally think it looks better with the bands. What do you think?

Teams like Ottawa have been killing themselves trying to just get in; Chicago just has to sit tight. The wear and tear of the push to get in, and to then actually win games will be a lot for some of these teams (see Calgary, etc)."
