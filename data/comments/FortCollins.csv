I would say none :(  There are a decent amount of sports bars that'll show the national games, but last time I tried to find someplace that had the MLB package I was disappointed.  Last year CB&Potts on Horsetooth had the MLB package.  When I was there in April, they didn't have it yet. Might be worth a call to see if they have it now."

FortCollins,3dy9cx,ScatMoerens,5,Mon Jul 20 14:51:24 2015 UTC,"Michael at Horsepower Auto Brokers is great.  They have an office on College in old town.  They have some cars on their lot, but mostly deal in buying off lease, late model cars.  You tell them what you want, and they find cars at the national auctions that you might want to bid on.  I saved about 10% on the car I bought from them this past spring.  They charge a flat fee for their services, and were very transparent about all the costs."
FortCollins,3dy9cx,AcuteAppendagitis,4,Mon Jul 20 15:13:11 2015 UTC,"CL is great, with this caveat: a serious seller will 1) have the emissions test done and 2) have a carfax ready. If they won't invest 50 bucks in selling their car, you shouldn't invest anything in buying it."
FortCollins,3dy9cx,debtfree2020,3,Tue Jul 21 02:37:36 2015 UTC,"I'd suggest craigslist and autotrader.  If you go to a dealer I don't think you get any better deal (probably a worse deal), and, frankly, I don't think that their cars are guaranteed to be any higher quality.  Just remember to spend the $50-$75 to take anything to a mechanic to get it checked out before you buy."
FortCollins,3dy9cx,CubsFan1060,6,Mon Jul 20 14:54:38 2015 UTC,That last sentence is what makes buying a used car of craigslist viable. Never trust the previous owners words about how it was treated
FortCollins,3dy9cx,HoldenH,2,Mon Jul 20 19:43:18 2015 UTC,I agree. I would also do this for a car at a dealer lot.  They may not know (or care) about a cars history or condition.

There is a good range of players there.

El Monte's menu is all gluten-free, and they have some delicious shit. Looks like Feasting can back up the gluten-free menu at Blue Agave. Anyway, I'd look there and call any that you want to try to verify before going."
FortCollins,3dsdf4,O_Cressida,4,Sun Jul 19 02:05:37 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the shout out, and you're right - I totally need to clean up some of the search functions.   As for GF suggestions, especially for celiacs, there's not a whole lot of options, /u/ItWasMyWifesIdea. Restaurants here are not stellar with cross contamination practices.   El Monte is actually great with a pretty much fully GF regular menu, so there's not much of a chance for cross contamination either way. A lot of GF readers end up eating there safely. Blue Agave is indeed another option. You can also try:    Big Al's Spoons Rainbow  La Buena Vida"

You choose the vegetables and meats, and the sauces/oils that go into it and they cook it on a big griddle. I've seen people ahead of me in line that had OTHER allergies, and the guys who cook it really go after cleaning the griddle first and then isolating the food from other people's mixes.

You mean, like, camping all by yourself in the woods?    Try any of the lakes up by Walden that you have to hike to.  The longer the hike, the fewer neighbors you're likely to have.   Kinda the same thing with the Roosevelt Forest:  anyplace you have to hike to, you're more likely to be alone."
